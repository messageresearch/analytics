I just [snorts] if y'all would agree with me tonight in faith, believing that'll happen and and do that with your own need. Um as we've been told so many times, the prophet said, "It's a finished work." You need healing in your body, that body is right there. that whale body is right there in front of you. You just walk to it. So, let's let's take these needs uh to him tonight. Heavenly Father, we're so grateful, Lord, that we have a place that we can come to, Lord, to bring our needs before you, to bring the the the cares of our life to you, Father. Lord, this this week, I've been thinking of the service that we had here Sunday, Lord. uh the the things Lord that were brought out of the things in our life father that you know when we call ourselves Christian we say we are Christlike and the things that we have in our life Lord that are unlike that Lord the prophet said that so many times that leads to us not receiving the healing that we need the the things Lord that that come between that healing that blessing Father is things that that we carry in our life Lord help us to to to drop those Lord as as our brother was preaching Sunday, Lord, and the bitterness, the grudges, the the the spite, Lord, anything that we would have against another brother or sister. Father, Lord, that could that could be the thing that's keeping us from receiving what we've asked for. Lord, help us to get in the same the one mind and one accord as we're in the upper room. The Bible says they received all of them received the Holy Ghost because they were all in one mind and one accord, Father. Lord, I pray that the bride would get that way around the world, Father, and that's what would bring your coming. I pray that these needs, Lord, have been brought before you tonight, Lord. We lay them at your feet. There's nothing we could do within within ourselves, Lord. Lord, we're where it would be impossible, Lord. But with with you, all things are possible. Lord, we invite you tonight. We welcome you here tonight, Lord. Help us to remove anything in our hearts, our minds, anything that we want to do later, what we're going to do tomorrow. Father, and focus only right now on what we're given to you, Lord. May we worship you and praise you with everything that's within us, Lord. Bless the service. Bless the the musicians, the singers, Lord. But anoint brother Aaron the Lord. And Lord, I pray as Brother Donnie comes, Lord, that you would get him out of the way that you can use the gift, Lord, that you placed in his life. Speak to your bride. Lord, this is your time.

[music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I [singing] don't know [music] about tomorrow. [singing] I [music] just live from [singing] day to day. I don't [singing and music] borrow from it [singing] sunshine. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; for ice snow skies may turn [singing] to gray. [music] I don't worry for [music] the [singing] future for I know [singing and music] what Jesus said. And [music] I [singing] know he walks beside me [singing and music] and he knows [music] what lies ahead. [singing] So many [music] things about tomorrow. [singing and music] I don't seem to understand, [music] but I know [singing] who holds tomorrow. [music] And [singing] I know who holds my hand. [singing] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know [music] about tomorrow. [singing] It may bring [music] me poverty, but the one [music] who holds the sparrow is the one [music] who watches me. And the path [music] that be [singing] my portion [music] whether through [singing] the flame or flood [music] and his presence [singing] goes before me and [music] I'm covered [singing] by him Oh [singing] many [music] things about tomorrow [music] I don't seem to understand [music] but I [singing] know who holds tomorrow and I know who holds holds my hand. [music] I don't know about tomorrow, [music] but I know who holds [singing and music] my hand. [applause and music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; They never knew a dark night. always had the sun's light on their face. [music] Perfect in glory, broken by the story of untold grace. [music] Come that day, majesty had come down. [singing] [music] Glory has succumbed now to flesh and bone. In [music] the arms of a manger, in the hands of strangers, they could not know just who they [music] hold. And the angels [singing] filled the sky. [music] All of heaven wondered [singing] why. Why the king would choose to be be a baby [music and singing] born to die. [music] [music] And all fell silent for the cry of a man in the voice of God [music] was dividing history for those with eyes to [music and singing] see the sun would shine from earth at night and the angels [music and singing] filled the sky. of [music and singing] heaven. Wonder why [music] the king would choose to be. Be a baby born [music] for me. A baby born to die to break [music] the chains of guilt [singing] and sin. Find us here to [music and singing] pull us in. So we can join [music] in heaven [singing] song. And with one voice around the throne. [music] All the angels [music and singing] fill the sky. And I can't help but [music and singing] wonder why why this king would choose to [music and singing] be be a baby born for me. Be a [music and singing] baby born to die. All the angels [music] fill the sky. And I can't help but [singing] wonder why. Why [music] this king would choose [singing] to be [music] a baby born for me. Be a [singing] baby born [music] to die. Be a [singing] baby born [music] to die. [singing] [applause] Amen. I certainly appreciate those specials tonight. Let's just stand as we change the order of service. Amen. How many come with expectant heart tonight? [music] Amen. No matter what you need. Amen. No matter what it is, the Lord knows. And I mean the Lord can [music] touch each and every heart gathered here tonight. Let's just sing this little course to him. Amen. As [music] brother Donnie would come. Jesus, draw me close. Closer to Lord to thee. Amen. How many is [music] that is that your desire for this year? Amen. Jesus just draws closer. Jesus, [singing and music] draw me close, closer, [singing] [music] Lord, to you. Let [singing and music] the world around me fade [singing] away. [singing] Jesus, [music] draw me close, closer, [music and singing] Lord, to you. I desire [singing] to worship [music] and oy. [singing] Oh, sing [music] it to him tonight. Oh Jesus, draw [singing] me [music] close. Close Lord [singing] to you. [music] Let the world [singing] around me [music] away. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I [music] deserve to worship and [music] praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Before we read the scripture tonight, um I want us to pray kind of kind of soon. Um brother Timberad had text me this afternoon and his wife had had a a heart attack today and uh she's in the hospital and he text me just a few minutes ago before I came out and said that she's in a lot of pain. They've put a patch so nitro I suppose on her and they're going to look at doing a maybe possibly a stent whatever tomorrow but he said she's in severe pain right now. How many else has a need on your heart and life tonight? All right. Can we just pray together as we pray over the word and pray for our sister? Lord Jesus, we believe that you're present help to us in the time of need. Dear God, you see our sister Bdette. Lord, I know it must have been very pressing for brother Tim to text and ask for prayer. Lord, we're grateful that we have you that we can come to in the time of such need. Lord Jesus, you see what's going on in our body and just not that many weeks ago having another episode. And Father, we're just praying that you'd move forward. We believe in doctors. We believe in medicine. We believe in all that, Lord. and we thank you for the things they can do. But we know many times they don't know what to do. But we're praying right now in the name of Jesus. May the spirit of God go to that hospital where she is. May the angels of the Lord be present, Father. And we know that you've designated healing angels when it comes to the administration of it to your saints. May you move for our sister tonight, Lord. You saw the hands that were uplifted, the requests that laid beneath those hands and the desires. Father, this prayer calls that I have in my hand tonight, the sister Lord and writing in and meeting this for her children and the request about the grandchildren. You know all about it, Father. We committed to you tonight. I pray that you'd help us, Lord, as we look into your word, oh Jesus. We know that your word is the fountain of great understanding for us and it brings illumination and help. Help me tonight, Father, that I can get out of the way. And may our hearts be so open to receive from you, dear God, I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight. &gt;&gt; Privilege for us, isn't it, to be gathered together. First Kings chapter 17:E9. The Lord has a different way of dealing with me. He'll let me study for days and hours, look at hundreds of quotes on a direction that I think is what I'm preaching on Wednesday night or Sunday morning. And then he'll wait till Wednesday afternoon and say, "No, Donnie, that's not it." So that's the way he done me this evening. &gt;&gt; So I've been sweating bullets ever since. First Kings 17:9. I want to speak to you tonight on being certain of God. Arise, get thee to Zerapath, which belongth to Zidon, and dwell there. Behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee. I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee. So he arose and went to Zarapath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold the widow woman, the widow woman, not one of many, but the &gt;&gt; widow woman. Now, this is why I believe about prophecy. God deals on both ends. &gt;&gt; I don't believe it's dark and deep and mysterious and all that sort of thing and it's guess and happen stance. No, I I believe this is the way God wants it to be. And the widow woman was there gathering sticks. And he called to her and said, "Fetch me, fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel that I may drink." And as she was going to fetch it, don't you love that vernacular? Fetch. He called to her and said, "Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand." Now remember what the Lord told him. The Lord told him, "I have commanded a widow woman to sustain thee." So it's not unusual then for him to ask for bread and water. You imagine what he thought whenever this woman answers him and she said, "As the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but a handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruise. And behold, I'm gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die. You imagine Elijah thinking, &gt;&gt; "God, you sent me to a woman. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; She's got one handful of meal and a little bit of oil and her and a boy's going to eat this and they're dying. and you sent me to a woman to sustain me who's on the very verge of starvation herself. &gt;&gt; Don't you love God's ways? &gt;&gt; They're very confusing. &gt;&gt; You might as well say amen. It's the truth. &gt;&gt; Sometimes at times he tells you something, his word, and you think, really? And Elijah said unto her, "Fear not. Go and do as thou hast said, but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it to me, and after make for thee and thy son. Here we go. For thus saith the Lord God of Israel, the barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the crus of oil fail until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth. May the Lord bless his word. You may be seated. He must have noticed it for several days. He kept getting a little bit more hungry every day. And probably he noticed that his mama wouldn't eaten every day. &gt;&gt; And he felt himself getting weaker. and he wondered what's what's mama going to do. Now remember this was a widow woman but she had a son and as any true mother would have done in a situation like this. No doubt this mother the way I remember seeing my mother cuz we was raised poor. And I remember mama fixing supper for us little Reagan kids. But mama not being hungry, which I found that hard to believe at the time &gt;&gt; and I didn't understand cuz I wasn't a parent yet. So you imagine this little fella as he's looking around and this is the last night. Now she knows that after this there's nothing else left. And this woman is not a Hebrew. She is not a Jew. She is a gentile. &gt;&gt; She must have put him to bed early. And she herself as she laid there, it was so hot and dry because the famine had been there for quite some time. And she was now in in another part. She wasn't even in the land of Israel, but in a bordering place. But the famine was so dire that even other countries were starting to experience it and are laying there thinking tomorrow will be our last meal. Maybe the little boy said, "Mama, when can we have some more vegetables? Mama, what about dates and and dried fruits? Maybe Oh, honey, maybe. Yeah, maybe. We we we'll try to we'll try to do that. We we'll try to we'll see if something will work out. But you imagine as she lay there nod and the tears rolling out of her eyes realizing tomorrow will be our last meal. I've got one handful left and it'll make maybe one little hoake. How many of y'all know what a ho cake is? I feel sorry for the rest of you Yankees then. and her thinking in her mind that one little handful of meal and just a little bit of oil, it won't go very far. So, the only thing I know to do is just we'll eat it and I'm going to break the news to him. Son, I hate to tell you, but we're going to die. But now, wait a minute. Didn't God say he had already commanded a widow woman to feed Elijah? What I find amazing about that statement is she didn't even know it yet. &gt;&gt; You see, the way God's word is, God can say something and the people on the earth to fulfill it and they don't even know yet. They're called to fulfill it. &gt;&gt; Amen. I like that cuz I think that's me and you. &gt;&gt; I wonder what God's got on his mind for us that we don't even know yet is our word. This was her word. Had she knew that word was hers, she could have rejoiced and been so happy. She wouldn't have understood how it was going to come to pass. But she would have known somehow God was going to make a way. Amen. &gt;&gt; You imagine her as she lay there in the night and many of you have been hungry before and you you wake up and you can't wait for you to be able to get up and eat some breakfast or get a snack or something another. Probably most of us didn't experience what she had. And it was so painful, not only just in her own body, but to see a little boy. Pull him up close to her. Honey, it's going to be all right. The Lord God is going to do something for us. Now, what I find amazing is that this woman whenever she spoke to Elijah and she said, "As the Lord thy God liveth and she calls him by his Hebrew revelatory name, capital L, capital O, capital R, capital D." Who told her that? That name was secret. That name was made known to Abraham and his seed. And yet when she spoke to Elijah, now I want you to notice also that she recognized the Elijah ministry. &gt;&gt; Oh, and &gt;&gt; she recognized that he was God's prophet. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, it also spoke complimentary about her because God would have never sent him to a house that would not have matched him. That makes me feel pretty good as well. [laughter] You know why God don't send this message to everybody? Cuz they ain't a perfect fit for an Elijah ministry. &gt;&gt; I'm glad I fit this word. Aren't you? And what I don't fit yet, he'll mold and shape me till I do fit. &gt;&gt; Now watch as she now enters in and the daylight maybe is just broken through the window and she realizes today without something happening, it will be the final day. There's no more food. Nobody in the city has hardly anything to eat. And if they did, only the rich would be able to get it. &gt;&gt; So she's finally resolved to accept it. Today is the final day. Notice now again in verse 10. So he rose and went to Zarapath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks. And he called to her and said, "Fetch me, I pray, that a little water in a vessel that I may drink." And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her and said, "Bring me, I pray, thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand." Now notice her response now. And she said, "As the &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; thy God &gt;&gt; liveth." Now, how does she know the Lord is his God? Now, reckon she done a YouTube check. &gt;&gt; Reckon she checked all the local papers in Jeffersonville. I I mean, uh, Jerusalem or wherever, to do a background check on on this guy and see if she could find out if he was a true prophet or a false one. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Now, just in case you're curious, I couldn't find this story to be vindicated in the Courier Journal about this widow. I &gt;&gt; I couldn't find it in Snoops or Snopes or Snoopies or anywhere else to make sure that this is actually factual, but the Bible tells me and that's all I need to know. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, watch how this woman is showing already that she matches this prophet and his message. As the Lord thy God livest, I have not a cake, but a handful of meal in a a barrel, and a little oil in a cruise. And behold, I'm going I'm gathering two sticks, that I may go dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it and die. Now, watch this. How the prophet brings into view about characters of the Old Testament and us as well. This is Be Certain of God in 1959. If you haven't listened to it, I would highly recommend it. I listen to it about six times today. So, I think it'd do you good. You know, when we have confessed our sins and met every requirement that God requires, we believed on God and there's circumstances that has to be met and according to his will and we've confessed our sins and we've made all the wrongs that we've did right and done everything we know how to do. Now listen how he keeps emphasizing this through this message. So there's certain things that God requires. And if there's unconfessed sin or things that needs to be fixed in your life, then before God's going to move for you 100% in that avenue, you got to fix it. So he said, "Every requirement that God has made or ask, we have met the requirement and yet he lays silent and just won't answer us. Anybody ever been there &gt;&gt; to where you'd done everything that you knew to do and God is silent &gt;&gt; and maybe you set an interview with brother JD to come and talk to me or or you'll run into one of the other ministers out in the parking lot and you said, "Brother, I'm just having a hard time. Would you pray for me?" And they pray for you and it seemed like their prayer never even left the parking lot. and you come and talk to me and I'll talk to you about this and that and the other and I did my best and you walked out and I say I can't believe brother Donnie didn't even help me. People told me they went in there and boy they flew out that door nearly they just got so blessed. I went in there and sat down and Lord I don't know what in the world's going on. THAT'S amazing how that God will do this that you do everything that he asked you to do and yet he lays silent at times and he just won't answer. I'm sure I'm speaking to peoples this morning who's come to that place. I've been there many times &gt;&gt; myself. You mean brother Brandham was not there one time, two times, three times, but many times in his own life that he did not know what to do and God would be silent. &gt;&gt; My goodness. When I went back and traced my life and turned over every stone and I'd find that I did something wrong. &gt;&gt; Everybody okay with me reading this quote tonight? You're okay believing this was a man that we're following. &gt;&gt; I couldn't follow any other kind of man cuz any other kind would be a fake. &gt;&gt; I ain't got a lick of confidence in a preacher that never tells you he falls short of the glory of God. First of all, he's a liar. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, notice what brother Brandham in his honesty would say. And I'd find that I did something wrong. I'd go and confess it and say, 'Lord God, I'll make it right. and go do so. Then come back again and SAY, "NOW LORD, THOU ART GOD. You'll answer me." Now notice what he did. He would do the same thing that most of us would do. So we would do something wrong or we would harm somebody or say something to them or something like that or offend somebody whatever it was that we did and the Lord would bring it to our heart and would go and clear the record with them or you know make it right with our wife or husband or friend or pastor or whatever we need to do and then we come back we think well praise God everything is going to be all right now it's definitely going to move now God did brother Brandham exactly the the same way that he does you and I. That makes me feel better. Praise the Lord. THEN HE SAID, "NOW I'D GO AND CONFESS IT AND SAY, LORD, God will make it right. GO DO SO, THEN COME BACK AGAIN AND SAY, now Lord, THOU ART GOD. YOU'LL answer me. Surely I've met every request that you required me to do, and every requirement, I have met it, and still he won't move." &gt;&gt; Wow. So you mean every prayer brother Brandham prayed and every time brother Brandham asked God, God didn't move for him like like us. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you friends, people that paint the picture to you the opposite or lying to you. &gt;&gt; Now let me just break it to you tonight. If brother Brandon was here alive today, still able to pray for the sick, all the sick that he would pray for would not get well. &gt;&gt; How many people do you figure died in the 33 and a2 years that Jesus was on the earth? &gt;&gt; Hundreds, if not thousands. &gt;&gt; And how many did he raise from the dead? &gt;&gt; How many did he heal? No doubt hundreds. But how many did to heal? &gt;&gt; Now I know of one setting in the Bible when he walked through a whole multitude of the sick and the impotent and they had all kinds of different plagues and whatever were wrong with them. But the father led him to one man who had a prostate trouble who had been laying there for all that time. I wonder how many babies that he stepped over. How many blind? How many crippled? HOW MANY HALT? HOW MANY M YOU MEAN the Lord Jesus didn't heal them all? If the Lord Jesus was HERE IN THIS BUILDING TONIGHT PHYSICALLY, he wouldn't heal every person that's sick. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE WILL of God is so broad and we're looking at it and sometimes God will allow sickness for a whip. Sometimes God will allow a sickness for a test. Sometimes he's testified about you before the devil up in heaven and you didn't hear the testimony. Too bad. You didn't HEAR WHAT GOD HAD TO say about you. But he's going to prove to the devil by the trial you're going through that you're the kind of person that he said you was. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; NOW WATCH. AND HE SAID HE STILL WON'T MOVE. and he seems to sit silent. That's when you've got to be sure that he is God. &gt;&gt; I want you to notice what you're to be sure of. Not yourself. &gt;&gt; Not the church you go to, not the pastor you're sitting under. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; You're to be sure of him. All people will let you down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't put your ultimate confidence in no man. I have my ultimate confidence in no human being. I put my ultimate confidence in the Lord Jesus. I have confidence in preachers and friends and church people and all that. Yes. BUT MY ULTIMATE CONFIDENCE I will put in nobody because they will disappoint you and let you down. Come on, say amen. So, what you need to be sure of tonight IS NOT THE PEOPLE you're going to church with. You don't need to be sure so much of the deacons or the preacher or the pastor or the associate pastor. You need to be sure of one being and that's Almighty God. &gt;&gt; Notice what he says then. THAT'S WHEN YOU'VE GOT TO BE SURE THAT HE IS GOD. DON'T BE DISCOURAGED. THE ONLY thing is that in your heart to be certain of God. And when you've met everything that he said, then you're SURE THAT HE'S GOD. THAT'S WHEN faith goes to work right there. Faith stands steady for it knows that he is. Notice now what faith believes. And you've met every requirement. You believe that he is. and faith holds steady. Now remember, this woman was a gentile. So she didn't actually even have a prophet that was allocated to her, a special Zidonian prophet or a Phoenician which was in a nearlocating community near her. She had one that GOD HAD SENT, BUT HE WAS A PROPHET OF ALL NATIONS. Now remember Elijah was not like some of the other JEWISH PROPHETS THAT SOME of the Old Testament prophets were only to Judah, some were to Israel. And then there was some like Elijah which was a national prophet. AND IT JUST SO HAPPENED THAT God sent a gentile, a national prophet. Now you see, IT HELPS US TO understand why God would use the same spirit of Elijah. And he would send that same spirit back again to a gentile woman on the face of the earth in the day and hour that we live in. And we're facing all kinds of tests and all kinds of trials and all types OF DIFFICULTIES. AND IF GOD SENT HIM to you, then it must SAY THAT GOD HAS confidence that you know what to do with this prophet's word. &gt;&gt; NOW NOTICE THE PROPHET can bring the word to the woman, but then the woman must know what to do with the word once it's delivered. &gt;&gt; Now notice he said when you've met every requirement, you believe that he is and faith holds steady. He said if you met God's requirement IN YOUR HEART, HE SAID GOD'S ONLY TESTING your faith for he loves to do that. Now remember I told you speaking about godliness that if you're like God, you love what God loves and hates what God hates. And and I told you there's some things that God loves that I'm still working on. &gt;&gt; This is one of them RIGHT HERE. GOD LOVES TO TRY ME AND I'M STILL PRAYING GOD HELP ME TO LOVE IT. NOW, MAYBE SOME OF Y'ALL LOVE IT WHEN God tries you. WELL, I I'M STILL WORKING on that love. Anybody know what I'M TALKING ABOUT? GOD LOVES TO TRY US, BUT IT MAKES ME NERVOUS. I GET ANXIOUS. I I get weary WITH IT ALL. NOTICE GOD'S ONLY TESTING your faith for he loves to do that. Can you imagine that God actually loves to put you RIGHT BACK AGAINST A WALL OR PUT YOU RIGHT TO WHERE IT LOOKS TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE AND then he himself will not be whispering love secrets to you but he will go into that silent mode and he will let you stand there SEEMINGLY BY YOURSELF. YOU PRAY, YOU read your Bible, YOU GO TO CHURCH. MY GOODNESS, you'd be just shouting victory tonight if some of you had a handful of meal. You'd say, "Really? a handful meal. It would FEEL LIKE A 55GALLON DRUM TO me as low as I am tonight. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? GOD LOVES TO FIND PEOPLE THAT HE CAN PUT THEM RIGHT IN SUCH A DIFFICULT SPOT AND THEN HE WILL remain silent. And you know how this battle works. When he chooses to remain silent, oh, SLOOH FOOT STARTS RUNNING HIS MOUTH LIKE A BLABBERMOUTH. GOD DON'T LOVE YOU. GOD DON'T CARE FOR YOU. GOD THIS. GOD THAT. GOD THAT. AND GOD WON'T EVEN SAY one word. and the devil takes that opportunity. But just remember, friends, when you're at that place, what you NEED TO DO IS SQUARE BACK OFF AND RE-EVALUATE and repprioritize things and say, "THERE'S ONE THING I'm sure of, and that is God is a mighty God. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHERE I'M AT. I don't understand why my family's going through this and that and the other, BUT I BELIEVE MY GOD IS A MIGHTY GOD. AND I BELIEVE HE HAS A HOLD TO MY LIFE. &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY. Let's have church tonight. &gt;&gt; God's only testing your faith for he loves to do that. And you have confessed your sin and you've MET EVERY REQUIREMENT THAT God requires. And still he lays silent. REMEMBER, FAITH says that he is. THEN FAITH HOLDS ON TO IT NOT KNOWING WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT, BUT IT KNOWS THAT HE IS. SO FAITH DON'T EVEN ALWAYS KNOW WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. FAITH DOESN'T ALWAYS KNOW WHY YOU'RE GOING THROUGH IT. BUT FAITH COMES BACK TO ONE THING. HE IS. HE IS. NOT HE WAS, NOT HE WILL BE. HE [screaming] IS. DO YOU BELIEVE he is? &gt;&gt; Oh, help us, LORD. IF HE REQUIRED YOU TO MEET THESE CIRCUMSTANCE, that's this is all from the same sermon. He goes over this over AND OVER AGAIN. REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS IN NEW YORK, BIMINGTON, New York, maybe 1951, I'M THINKING INDICOTT shoe company and there was a big famous shoe place there. So they had an auditorium that was named after that shoe company. HE SAID PEOPLE WOULD COME THROUGH THE PRAYER LINE. ONE man in particular who said the Lord had DELIVERED HIM OF A TERRIBLE, terrible disease and sickness. AND HE SAID IN A FEW DAYS THAT MAN COME BACK TO HIM. THE SAME thing was on him again. AND HE SAID OTHER PEOPLE KEPT COMING BACK AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD UNDER THE ANOINTING ON THE PLATFORM WOULD DRIVE THEM DEMONS OUT of their bodies. And then WHEN THEY WOULD GET OUT on their own away from the anointing OF THAT PROPHETIC GIFT, THAT DISEASE WOULD COME RIGHT BACK ON THEM. AND HE SAID THE ANGEL OF THE LORD MET HIM AND SAID, "TELL THEM PEOPLE TO GET UP THERE AND CONFESS THEIR SINS." &gt;&gt; NOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING? THE SPIRIT OF GOD WAS MAKING THEM DEMON SPIRITS LEAVE. BUT THEM DEMON SPIRITS KNEW THEM PEOPLE STILL HAD SOME THINGS IN THEIR LIFE THAT WASN'T RIGHT WITH GOD. OH, hallelujah to God. AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD DID NOT WANT THEM PEOPLE, LOOK AT THE MERCY OF GOD. THE ANGELS OF HEALING DID NOT WANT THEM PEOPLE GOING BACK HOME AFTER THOSE MEETINGS IN WORSE SHAPE, which they would HAVE BEEN. BECAUSE WHEN THAT THING GOES OUT AND IT COMES BACK, IT DON'T COME BACK ALONE. IT COMES BACK WITH OTHERS. That's right. AND HE DID NOT WANT THEM GOING BACK WITH THAT. HE WANTED THEM DELIVERED. SO HE TELLS THE PROPHET, "HAVE THEM PEOPLE TO GET UP AND confess their sins." Well, you know what? WHENEVER THEY DONE THAT, THEN HE PRAYED FOR THE OTHER PEOPLE AND IT LEFT THEM AND IT DIDN'T COME BACK. BUT HERE WE HAVE A DIFFERENT SCENARIO THAT YOU'VE DONE THIS AND YOU'VE DONE THAT AND YOU'VE MADE THIS RIGHT AND THAT RIGHT. AND GOD STILL lays lays. Notice the word he's using. lays, not sets, lays. So, it's like God's in a reclining position. Hang tight, Dave. I'll be with you before long. &gt;&gt; Someone is in your mind now figuratively, God's kicked back in this heavenly recliner, just getting massaged. You're crying. You're screaming. You're begging. God saying, "Hang with it, Donnie. Hang with it." And I said, "I'm trying, Lord. I'm trying, but I ain't getting massage. It's my nerves. I'm about to go crazy. God, help me. Lord, if you DON'T MOVE TODAY, I WANT TO SAY, GOD SAID, YOU'RE GOOD. You're good." &gt;&gt; But he don't say it. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; He's thinking it. I can't read his mind. Can you? &gt;&gt; CAN YOU READ GOD'S [screaming] MIND? NOTICE WHEN YOU'VE MET HIS REQUIREMENTS, THAT BRINGS YOUR FAITH to a showdown. If you met God's requirements and you've been met, notice this again and again, he uses this terminology, and you fully CONSIDERED AND HAVE DONE EVERYTHING GOD REQUIRES YOU TO DO, THEN YOUR FAITH rest that he is. &gt;&gt; Be certain &gt;&gt; of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. SO, IT'S TOO COMPLICATED. BUT IT'S TOO COMPLICATED. IT'S OVER MY HEAD. IF this is over your head, I wonder if you've got a head. &gt;&gt; This is TOO COMPLICATED TO KNOW ONE THING. &gt;&gt; HE IS. &gt;&gt; HE IS. [screaming] &gt;&gt; You know, he loves to test us. Apparently, the Lord knew I needed this. Brother preached a sermon in 1959. And he said, "I've got a young one down there in 2026. He's going to really struggle with some. I'm going to have my prophet say it over and over again. Tell him. Tell him Elijah. Tell him. Tell Donnie. Tell him. Get it over to him. Tell him. He loves to be tested. He loves to test you. He loves to do all this. HE LOVES TO SEE the reaction &gt;&gt; of your face." SO YOU SEE, IT'S NOT THAT GOD LOVES IT WHEN YOU'RE HAVING A HARD TIME, BUT GOD IS SENDING THE HARD TIME OR ALLOWING THE HARD TIME so he can see what really makes him so happy with his children. And that's the reaction of your faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you don't feel it, you don't see it, you don't understand it, but your faith says he is. &gt;&gt; He is. Just a couple of days before Erica passed over little girls was able to come and she was able to pull each one of them up close to her and just talk to them a little bit. I was standing near her when she spoke to one of them and she said, "Don't you ever forget we serve a mighty God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, she's laying there and cancer has riddled her body. &gt;&gt; She's been through one thing after another after another. What a heritage &gt;&gt; for a mama &gt;&gt; to leave for her babies. others. She told them, "Be sure you get the Holy Ghost." Not about, you know, roll your hair this way and curl it this way and be sure and use this rouge and use this lipstick and and do this and do that and the other. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, you talking about a testimony of a little daughter of God laying there in that bed. And within a couple of days or day and a half, something like that, after those words left her mouth, she was carried beyond the curtain of time. And I thought to myself, I've relived it out again today over and over again when I was listening to this tape. This is what kept coming back to me. THAT FAITH KNOWS HE IS. AMEN. THAT'S WHAT FAITH KNOWS. FAITH DON'T UNDERSTAND WHILE YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THIS TRIAL OR WHY YOU'RE FACING THIS TEST. FAITH DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL THE UPS AND THE DOWNS AND THE INS AND OUTS. BUT FAITH CAN COME BACK AND SAY, "HERE HE IS. HE IS WHAT? HE'S EVERYTHING YOU NEED. HE'S THE ALPHA. HE'S THE OMEGA. HE'S THE BEGINNING, THE END, THE FIRST, THE LAST. THERE'S NOTHING GREATER. THERE'S NOTHING BIGGER. HE'S GOT YOU, HALLELUJAH, ON HIS MIND. HE KNOWS HOW MUCH HE LOVES YOU. HE KNOWS HOW MUCH HE CARES FOR YOU. HE IS. HE'S RIGHT HERE TONIGHT. HE'S IN YOUR HEART. HE'S IN YOUR LIFE. HE LOVES YOUR FAMILY. HE IS. THAT'S WHAT FAITH KNOWS HE [screaming] IS. [applause] &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; He said he loves to see the reaction of your faith. Did you KNOW THAT GOD LIKES TO SEE HOW you'll react? &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU SAY, "OH LORD, I I BELIEVE YOU. THOU ART MY SAVIOR. I BELIEVE THAT YOU are the healer. I BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE THE ONE WHO gives the Holy Spirit and the things THAT I'M REQUIRING." YOU'RE THE GOD WHO GIVES THAT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And then when you CONFESS ALL YOUR SINS AND PROMISE GOD HE'LL DO WHAT HE LET YOU GET WELL. And then because it don't happen, you run off like a coward. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; RUN OFF LIKE A COWARD SOMEWHERE. God can't use that. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO WAY FOR HIM TO USE YOU. THERE'S NO WAY FOR HIM TO ANSWER YOU. FRIENDS, it makes you wonder. It makes you wonder. for a lot of our unanswered prayers, as we call them, and God don't move for us. And if we're not careful, we'll tend to blame the Lord for it. He ain't to blame for it. &gt;&gt; I would guarantee you one thing, he ain't to blame for nothing. &gt;&gt; Not wrong, anyway. &gt;&gt; COME ON. WHERE'S MOST OF IT GO? LET'S BE HONEST. PROBABLY COMES RIGHT back to ourselves. &gt;&gt; We're cowards. &gt;&gt; OH, YEAH. YOU GIVE UP ON DAY 632 AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW DAY 633 WAS GOING TO BE YOUR DAY OF DELIVERANCE. AND THE DEVIL BEAT YOU OUT OF AN ABSOLUTE PHENOMENAL MIRACLE AND YOU WAS WITHIN 24 HOURS OF HAVING IT DONE IN your life, but you got weak. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Oh my. NOTICE BECAUSE HE ONLY ANSWERS BY FAITH, THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU go away. LISTEN TO WHAT HAPPENS. YOU GO away and he can't answer. SO THE VERY [screaming] HOUR THAT WE DISBELIEVE, he can't answer. BUT REAL FAITH STANDS THERE being sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ready for this? &gt;&gt; This is so deep. Y'all ready? Hold on. That God is &gt;&gt; now amazing. Nobody shouted. Nobody jumped up and run around this building. I've seen people jump up and run for a whole lot of things that wasn't near as deep as what what I just read to you. &gt;&gt; If you could ever get that in your soul, there ain't enough powers in hell to ever stop you. &gt;&gt; There's not enough sickness. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TROUBLE TO KNOW that God is &gt;&gt; well. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Notice this. HE CAN'T ANSWER, BUT REAL TRACE TRUE FAITH stands there. BEING SURE THAT GOD IS BE CERTAIN that he is. You see, Abraham had this same type of faith to believe that God could move. He probably DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT TOOK 25 YEARS FOR GOD TO MANIFEST HIMSELF. BUT somebody just believed God and God kindly to him for righteousness. &gt;&gt; YES. WENT BEYOND HUMAN UNDERSTANDING, human reasoning, and believed. And you imagine this man didn't even have the Holy Ghost, didn't have the new birth, but he believed God. THREE OF MY BROTHERS ONE TIME GOT CAUGHT into a a very flammatory situation. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BOW THEIR knee at the image of a prophet of God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; REMEMBER THAT IMAGE WAS MADE OF DANIEL. &gt;&gt; YOU AND I ARE BEING FACED with the same thing in the last day. Folks around this message that want to MAKE AN IMAGE OF OUR PROPHET AND THEY WANT US TO BOW. SORRY, WE DON'T BOW our knees to any man. &gt;&gt; NO PASTOR, NO PREACHER, NO TEACHER, NO MAN. THERE'S ONLY ONE BEING THAT GETS OUR WORSHIP AROUND HERE. That's the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND WE KNOW OF COURSE THESE BROTHERS REFUSED. NOW REMEMBER they were comrades. They were buddies as we WOULD SAY WITH DANIEL AND IT WAS HARD AND YET THEY HAD A GREAT RESPECT for Daniel and a great honor for Daniel. That's why they couldn't bow because they knew who he was. And no true prophet of God would ever want anyone to bow to him. And the church said amen. NOW NOTICE BROTHER BRANDON preached about them when he preached the sermon. And he SAID WHEN THEY HEARD THEY GO TO the had to go to the fiery furnace, THEY SAID, "OUR GOD IS ABLE TO deliver us from this furnace, BUT IF HE DOESN'T DO IT, WE'RE NOT BOWING TO any of your idols." I love that BECAUSE IT'S EVIDENT THAT THEIR FAITH DID NOT TELL THEM YET that God WAS GOING TO DELIVER, BUT THEIR FAITH TOLD THEM ONE THING FOR SURE. We're not bowing to no image. Whether it's A PROPHET OF GOD, WHETHER IT'S THE MARK OF THE BEAST OR WHATEVER it is, WE ARE NOT BIND. YOU SEE, FAITH DID NOT TELL THEM, "DON'T WORRY about it. It's going to be fine. You're going to be okay." They said, "WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF HE'LL DO IT OR NOT." DON'T you understand? We approach things the same way in our life. We get sick, we get cancer, whatever it is, we approach it with the general orders of Mark 16. LAY HANDS ON THE SICK AND THEY SHALL RECOVER. AND WE DO THAT UNTIL GOD SAYS OTHERWISE. WE SAY, "WE KNOW OUR GOD CAN DELIVER. WE KNOW OUR GOD CAN HEAL. WE KNOW OUR GOD CAN DO IT." NOW, IS THAT HIS WILL FOR ME AT THIS TIME? I DON'T KNOW YET. BUT I KNOW ONE THING. WHICHEVER WAY IT IS, I'LL BE A VICTOR whichever way I go out. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOTICE HE SAID THEY KNOWED HE WAS JEHOVAH. THEY KNOW HE ANSWERED PRAYER. BUT WHETHER HE DID IT IN THEIR case or not, it would have to be for the good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah, here we go. SO, THEY JUST MADE THEIR STATEMENT, confessed their sins, and walked into death. HE GOES ON TO SAY THEY WERE CERTAIN OF GOD BECAUSE THEY KNOW GOD WOULD WORK EVERYTHING FOR THEIR GOOD. LISTEN TO THIS AND DON'T ever forget it. And when we are certain OF GOD, &gt;&gt; WE KNOW THAT GOD WORKS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Don't you see why we question these things? Because we're not certain about him yet &gt;&gt; and his sovereignty and his control and his power. WHEN WE ARE CERTAIN, EVEN THOUGH IT MAY RIP OUR HEART OUT, IT MAY COME OUT OF THE WAY. NO, NO, NO. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE PRAYED FOR. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANTED. &gt;&gt; AND WHY DO WE FEEL THAT WAY? CUZ WE'RE CERTAIN IN OUR MIND, OH, THE OUTCOME IS GOING TO BE THIS WAY. OH, YES, THAT'S IT. That's the will of the Lord. It's not for us to tell him what the will of the Lord is. &gt;&gt; But we can be certain he is. How this is GOING TO WORK OUT, I don't have an idea, but I know one thing, he is. He's in charge of my life. He's the one who brought me on my onto this earth and my journey. AND THE DEVIL CANNOT TAKE ME UNTIL GOD'S finished with me. &gt;&gt; NOTICE WE KNOW THAT God when we are certain of God. We know that God works everything for our good. This ought to be a refrigerator quote. This ought to be on your iPhone, your Android, your iPad, your computer. Mark it on your forehead if you want to make you a t-shirt. Forget these football stars, baseball star. They're a bunch of heathen anyhow. Put some You're going to wear something on your on your clothes. Put something that amounts to something. &gt;&gt; WE KNOW THAT GOD WORKS EVERYTHING FOR OUR GOOD. Is there anybody here tonight that believes this quote? &gt;&gt; What a few of you. Well, praise the Lord. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHAT DO WE DO WHEN WE COME TO THE SPOT? THEN WE ARE being certain of us of the medical science, &gt;&gt; certain of God. &gt;&gt; So they made one statement and they were certain. They walked right into the fiery furnace and God let them walk right there sitting right there looking at him. He wanted to see their reaction. You imagine almighty God just sitting there watching looking at him saying I want you to look at that. You ever seen anything like that in your life? They were CERTAIN HE WAS GOD. THEY WAS NOT CERTAIN. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PROPHET IS BRINGING HERE? THEY WERE NOT CERTAIN ABOUT WHAT IT WAS PERTAIN TO THEM, BUT THEY WERE CERTAIN ABOUT GOD. &gt;&gt; They made their confession. They made everything right. And they knowed, they were certain that he was God. SO THEY WALKED RIGHT UP THAT FIERY FURNACE and right at the last moment. That scares me. I mean, I'm always the type of guy if I've got an appointment here at the church and I've got to meet somebody, I've got to talk to them at 4:00. I'm here no later than 4, you know, 3:40. I mean, I'm I'm late. If I'm here at 3:45, I always want to be early. And God says, "Uh, Donnie, that ain't going to work with me cuz I don't operate on your time. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I wait till the very last moment." &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. So they walked right UP TO THE FIERY furnace and right at the last moment there he come riding right out of the heavens on a chariot of wind fanned the breezes OFF OF THEM WHILE he consoles them. Glory to God. And talked to them. GOD LET YOUR FAITH COME TO THE SPOT WHERE IT'LL REACT. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT SOMETIMES THIS TYPE OF DYNAMIC FAITH, BROTHER JIM, IT DON'T REACT IN THE EARLY INITIAL STAGES, YOU THINK IT DOES, BUT IT TAKES DILEMMA. IT TAKES SOMETIMES PRESSING US. &gt;&gt; This has been pretty pressing, right? &gt;&gt; I mean, the guys that's got a hold of your arms dies throwing you in &gt;&gt; and you're thinking, Lord, if you're going to show up, you're going have to show up quick. Where's the thermostat? Where's the thermostat? And I'm breaking out sweating already. Oh Lord, where's it at? Where's it at? And the very last moment BEFORE THEY WOULD, YOU KNOW, THAT IS WITH FIRE. BROTHER RON SPENCER GOT BURNED years and years ago. And whenever that happened, he breathed that fire inside of his lungs, just fried his lungs and done all kinds OF DAMAGE. YOU IMAGINE THEY'RE THAT CLOSE. THEY'RE THAT CLOSE TO THAT FIRE. AND ONE MOMENT left and all of a sudden here come this gigantic breeze. this fan just and then they were standing right in the middle of the fire, BUT THEY WASN'T BEING BURNED. ALL THREE OF THEM WAS BEING ENCIRCLED BY THIS BREEZE. IT'S A HEAVENLY DIMENSION. BOY, it wouldn't look somebody on the earth right to make a fan like this. IT KEPT THE SMOKE OFF OF THEM. NOT EVEN ONE HAIR ON THEIR HAND OR THEIR ARMS GOT SINNED. AND THEY WERE STANDING THERE FELLOWSHIPPING WITH THE PRE-INCARNATE SON OF GOD. WHY? THEY WERE CERTAIN HE IS. THEY WAS NOT CERTAIN ABOUT THE OUTCOME. THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW IT WAS GOING TO GO. BUT THEY WERE CERTAIN ABOUT ONE THING. WE AIN'T BOWING TO YOUR IMAGE. WE'RE NOT BOWING TO YOUR IMAGE. AND WE KNOW OUR GOD IS. [applause] Now back to Zarapath. I don't know how it happened really. [snorts] I'm going to ask her when I see her. I don't know how she knew. I don't know who told her or if it's just something the father shared with her cuz her name was on his book. &gt;&gt; But the prophet says it this way about that little woman. This poor little woman. She knew that he was God. And as the barrel went down, down, down, down, [gasps] circumstances got worse and worse &gt;&gt; all the time. But God WAS LETTING IT GET that way. He just loves to do that. &gt;&gt; I'm honest tonight. Lord, help me. &gt;&gt; Help me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to pray for this for these lying sinners sitting here tonight. They need help, too. Lord, &gt;&gt; he loves TO DO THAT. HE LOVES TO PUT YOUR FAITH TO A TEST TO SEE HOW YOU ACT on it. LET YOU BE ANOINTED AND BE PRAYED FOR, then make your worse. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir. Brothers and sisters, this is separating the men from the boys. &gt;&gt; This is separating the bride from the church. &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY. THIS IS SEPARATING MAKE BELIEVERS FROM BELIEVERS. &gt;&gt; YOU DO EVERYTHING GOD SAYS AND THEN YOU WALK UP THERE. I'M HAVING BROTHER DONNIE THE BROTHERS TO PRAY FOR ME. HALLELUJAH. I believe it. GLORY TO GOD. AND YOU WALK UP THERE AND GOD TELLS THE DEVIL, I NOW TOMORROW MAKE HER WORSE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; I think sometimes I need to start a 575p part series on faith. &gt;&gt; Notice this. LET YOU BE ANOINTED THEN MAKE YOU WORSE AND SAY COME ON [screaming] SATAN. You imagine God inviting the devil to come and mess with you. Come on, Satan. PUT HIM TO THE TEST. But listen, these next four words, I know he believes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy, children. If we could only hear God say that about us, we would never have no more tests, would we? We' just say, "Where you at, devil?" Every day we get up looking for him. Come on. Come on. Come on. COME ON. YOU IMAGINE GOD TELLING THE DEVIL THAT, "COME ON, DEVIL. COME ON." SHE GOT PRAYED FOR, HE GOT PRAYED FOR. HEY, COME ON. TRY TO HIT HER HARDER. LET HER BLOOD PRESSURE GO EVEN HIGHER. LET HIS HEADACHE GET EVEN WORSE. BUT HE WON'T turn his back on me. &gt;&gt; I know he believes me. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. I KNOW HE BELIEVES ME. THEN BROTHER SAID, "BLESS GOD FOREVER." Y'ALL hear him PREACH THIS. OH MY. PUT HIM TO A TEST NOW. I KNOW HE TOOK MY WORD FOR IT. And then he asked this question. Could he say that about you? &gt;&gt; Don't tell me how many cues you know on a guitar. Don't tell me how well you can play the piano or the organ or how many times you can jump up and down, speak in tongues or shout. How many people you prayed for and they've got healed. On this very same tape, you'll hear the prophet of God say that a person could be healed. And he said faith can't even come coming from their heart and it's not even a genuine CLEAN HEART. JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE BELIEVE AND SOMEBODY GOT HEALED, IT DON'T MEAN THEY'VE GOT THIS. &gt;&gt; But when God can say, "Come on, devil. &gt;&gt; I know him." That's what he said about Job. GO AHEAD, TAKE HIM. But the prophet said, "God and Job had been fellowshipping together." And God bragged on him. Ain't no another man like him in all the earth. Praise be to [laughter] God. Oh my. PUT HIM TO THE TEST NOW. I know he took my word. Could he say that about you? HE SAID THAT ABOUT JOE. DO ANYTHING TO HIM YOU WANT TO, but don't take his life for I know he loves me. HE'S MADE THE BURNT OFFERING. HE'S MADE THE REQUIREMENTS. HE DID WHAT I told him to do and he believes it. Now roll him over the coals. Lord, make it a little bit easier there if you don't mind. I mean, come on. Have the devil roll me over jelly rolls maybe or cinnamon buns or maybe chocolate or, you know, crepes. Crepes. That would be the thing. Roll us over crepes with whipped cream. Blueberries and strawberries on the side. Oh, God make me a holy roller. Let it be crepes. And I'm rolling over, Lord. Let make my You yellow belly coward. OH, GOD AIN'T LOOKING FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE WEAK AND FEEBLE AND CAN'T STAND THERE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A RAPTURE TIME, FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS PEOPLE THAT CAN STAND AND LOOK THE DEVIL IN THE FACE AND SAY, "I BELIEVE HIM. [clears throat] I KNOW HE IS." BUT WHAT [screaming] ABOUT YOU? WE AIN'T TALKING ABOUT ME. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HIM. WHAT ABOUT THIS PREACHER? WHAT ABOUT THAT PERSON? I AIN'T TALKING ABOUT THEM. I'M TALKING ABOUT HIM. [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; BOY. BOY. You imagine when God tells the devil this now? Roll him over the coals if you want to. Well, you know he wants to. ROLL HIM OVER THE COALS IF YOU WANT TO. He took everything away from him. God doubled it when he gave it back to him. He puts our faith to a test to see if we really believe in the seven seals and the seven thunders and the seven trumpets and we believe that he is God. &gt;&gt; FRIENDS, DON'T YOU WHEN THE MESSAGE FOLKS EVER GOING TO get it? When are you going to get it? IT'S NOT BELIEVING IN CERTAIN DOCTRINES AND CERTAIN IDEOLOGOLOGY THAT'LL HELP YOU OVERCOME THE DEVIL. SO, WHAT SEAL DO YOU USE WHEN YOU'RE FACING TEMPTATION? WHAT THUNDER IS IT THAT YOU USE WHEN YOU'RE BEING TESTED BY LUST, BROTHERS? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; This is the way we overcome. This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith, &gt;&gt; not our knowledge. [sighs] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. He puts our faith to a test as if we really believe that he's God. That little woman no doubt said, "I prayed and I prayed and I know I'm an unworthy gentile." When she seen that last little cake, death had done entered the gate and come into the door. One more bite a piece. So her little boy gets a bite. No doubt she told him to take a bigger bite than hers and she gets the little bite and she and her son died. I can see her all night praying. The hot winds are blowing. The earth parched. The people crying and screaming in the street. She walked around through the house. She looked at her little boy, looked at his little pajamas and they were all out and his little feet sticking out. Looked at her own hands wrinkled. You walked back and forth and said, "Hallelujah. [laughter] I KNOW [screaming] he's God. &gt;&gt; I know he's God. And I've made all of my confession. I've done everything that he required. And I'm asking for our lives for his glory." God seen her. Now, there's a woman, another woman not too far from this place. She's the queen. &gt;&gt; Her name is Jezebel. &gt;&gt; She heard it over and over again. The ministry of Elijah, &gt;&gt; but she hated him. &gt;&gt; And she said, "I'LL DESTROY HIS INFLUENCE. I'LL GET ON [screaming] YOUTUBE. I'LL MAKE ALL KINDS OF VIDEOS. &gt;&gt; I'LL kill him. &gt;&gt; Isn't it amazing? One woman from one side and another woman from another side. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the word of the Lord spoke her destiny as well. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; For the dogs will lick your blood. What made the difference? Their attitude toward the message of Elijah. &gt;&gt; Now, for people who think a prophet is important. Well, when we get there that day, maybe you can ask this widow of Zarapath if she thought a prophet was important or not. &gt;&gt; AND MAYBE YOU MIGHT ASK THE ANIMALS uh that'll be there in the millennium if they thought a prophet's message was important in pre-andoluvian destruction. MAYBE YOU MIGHT ASK THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL DOWN IN THE LAND OF EGYPT WHENEVER THEY COME OUT IF THEY thought a prophet was important. Need I go on? IF YOU WOULD TAKE ALL THE BOOKS OUT OF YOUR BIBLE THAT WAS WRITTEN BY PROPHETS, HOW BIG WOULD YOUR BIBLE BE? &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; I DON'T BLAME EVERYBODY. THIS MESSAGE AIN'T FOR THEM. IT'S TOO RICH. GOT TOO MANY VITAMINS. VITAMIN A FOR ALPHA. VITAMIN B FOR BEGINNING. VITAMIN C FOR CHRIST, VITAMIN D FOR DEITY, VITAMIN E FOR EVERYTHING, VITAMIN F FOR FIRST, VITAMIN G FOR GOD, VITAMIN I FOR THE I AM. AND YOU KNOW, I GO ON ON AND ON AND ON. AND FOR, YOU KNOW, THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE A STOMACH FOR THE WORD, you got anymore? You got anymore? Wow. I've never ate this good in my life. THIS IS AWESOME. I'M GETTING SO FAT. I WANT TO WEIGH 5,000 POUNDS SPIRITUALLY BEFORE I LEAVE THIS WORLD. YOU'LL BE OVERWEIGHT AND THE POWER OF GOD will change me. I ain't worried about being OVERWEIGHT NO RAPTURE. OH, HALLELUJAH. I'M GOING TO KEEP ON EATING AND FEEDING AND FEEDING UNTIL MY BODY SAYS, DONNIE, IF YOU DON'T QUIT, I CAN'T TAKE IT NO MORE. AND I'M SAYING, GET USED TO IT, BODY, CUZ I'M GOING TO KEEP ON FEEDING TO THIS WORD. HALLELUJAH. AND HIS ANOINTING COMING DOWN AMONG US AND HEALING THE SICK AND DOING THE SUPERNATURAL OF GOD. I [screaming] GAVE THAT SAME ANOINTING WE EXPERIENCE RIGHT HERE IN THIS CHURCH IS GOING TO SWEEP OVER YOU AND IN ONE MOMENT YOU'LL BE AN OLDER MAN AND THE NEXT MOMENT YOU'LL BE TURNED INTO AN 18YEAR-OLD BOY. [applause] HALLELUJAH. [screaming] [laughter] [sighs and gasps] Daylight broke. She said the little fella had cried all night for something to eat. What will I do with one little handful of meal? You know that meal was Christ. Any Bible student knows that Christ was the meal offering. And that meal offering had to be ground with a special burr to cut it every little piece of the corn the same because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. In St. John 4, the father seeketh such to worship him in spirit and in truth and Jesus was the truth. He was the meal offering. Then this oil was the spirit. So the spirit mixed with the truth. So what's in her house? a handful of meal and a little bit of oil. She has to take the ingredients to mix it together to minister to Elijah his cake. WHERE'S OUR FAITH? WHEN GOD'S WORD IS PREACHED IN ITS SIMPLICITY, THOUGH IN ITS POWER THAT JESUS CHRIST IS THE same yesterday and forever, and the word goes forth for the meal, YOU'VE GOT THE OIL to mix with it. AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOW NOTICE THE WORD COMING FORTH. THEN YOU THAT ARE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT, YOU'VE GOT YOUR OIL. &gt;&gt; AND THE WORD COMING FORTH, HALLELUJAH, IT DON'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE WHETHER IT'S FROM YOUR FAVORITE PREACHER OR NOT. IF IT'S THE WORD, YOU SHALL BE ABLE TO RECEIVE IT FROM A MAN AND YOU MAY NOT EVEN LIKE HIS MAKEUP, BUT YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT HIS MAKEUP. YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT HIS HAIRSTYLE. YOU'RE LISTENING FOR GOD TO SPEAK TO YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND IF YOU'RE THERE AND YOU'VE GOT A NEED AND THAT WORD COMES AND THERE'S CHRIST THE MEAL AND YOU REACH UP AND GRAB A HOLD OF IT, what are you doing? You're mixing your oil &gt;&gt; with that word. &gt;&gt; And the word goes forth for the meal. YOU'VE GOT THE OIL TO MIX WITH IT. And it may be just a little handful or a spoonful, but whatever it is, it's real. So, you've got the meal. Now, this is what she had. And she had the oil, but there's one part missing it. The cross. The cross. I want you to notice SHE DOESN'T FIND THE cross in her home. SHE DOESN'T FIND THE CROSS IN HER NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE. She's out looking for the cross when she runs into Elijah. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I thought somebody shot glory on that one. &gt;&gt; NOTICE NOW WHAT IS IT READY FOR? It's ready for the cross. It's ready for self-sacrifice. And that's what you have TO DO. IT'S THE WORD'S BEEN PREACHED AND YOU'VE GOT THE SPIRIT IN MIXED TOGETHER. It's self-sacrifice. to deny every pain. &gt;&gt; Listen [laughter] friends, THIS WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE IF YOU'LL LET IT. &gt;&gt; LISTEN TO WHAT THE WORD OF GOD COME IN PREACH AND THEN YOU TAKE THAT INTO YOUR HEART AND LET THE SPIRIT OF GOD IN YOUR SOUL AS IT CAPTURES THAT WORD. THEN THE CROSS WHICH CAN ONLY BE APPLICABLE by you. YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR CROSS. WHAT WILL IT BE? SELF-SACRIFICE, to deny every pain, to deny every sickness, to deny everything that's contrary to God's word and stand on it. The doctor says this, that, or the other. That don't make a bit of difference. You stand ON IT BECAUSE GOD SAID SO. THE MEAL COMES, you've got the oil, you mix it together. HALLELUJAH. LOOK AT THE CROSS. WELL, I GOT PRAYED FOR ABOUT MONDAY AFTER OH, LORD, AFTER THAT SERVICE ON SUNDAY, I I GOT PRAYED FOR AND I FELT SO WONDERFUL IN CHURCH ON SUNDAY. WOULDN'T YOU KNOW THAT DEVIL ATTACKED ME? WELL, OF COURSE HE'S GOING TO. &gt;&gt; You've got to take them two pieces, &gt;&gt; them sticks of wood. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And you got to know what to do with them. She didn't specify three, four, five, six, seven. Two, &gt;&gt; a main beam and a cross beam. And then she's got to climb up on that cross. And I hear a voice. It's a little after daylight. A voice speaks and says, "Go out in the yard and get two sticks." Did you notice the scripture said two sticks for cross? She got the meal and the oil, but she's going to be called now to act to act with it. Ever how much you've got much meal or oil as you need, but you've got to act. Self- sacrifice. two sticks. THE VOICE SAID, "GO THROUGH THE YARD. GET TWO STICKS." The same time up on the mountain, there's a voice thundered down to the prophet and said, "Go to the city. I have commanded." Oh my. Both of them obeyed. Something has to happen. Both of them are obeying. Oh, glory to God. Can't you understand? Malachi 4 is more than just brother Brandham. BEHOLD, I GOD SEND UNTO YOU, ME. &gt;&gt; YOU, TOO, CAROL. All right. You, too. You, TOO. YOU. OKAY. BEHOLD, I SEND UNTO YOU. [screaming] ELIJAH THE PROPHET. ELIJAH OBEYED GOD. NOW, GUESS WHOSE TURN IT IS? ELIJAH [screaming] OBEYED GOD. HE PREACHED WHAT GOD GAVE HIM. HE STOOD AGAINST THE DENOMINATION AND THE CHURCH WORLD. NOW IT'S YOUR TURN. OH, HALLELUJAH. [screaming] WE'RE NOT CALLED TO DO WHAT HE DONE. WE'RE CALLED TO TAKE OUR LITTLE HANDFUL OF MEAL AND OUR LITTLE BIT OF OIL AND MIX IT TOGETHER AND CLIMB RIGHT [screaming] UP ON THE CROSS AND SAY, "HERE, I'LL MANIFEST MY PART." &gt;&gt; OH, thank you, LORD. BOTH OF THEM ARE OBEYING. She don't know where the sticks will be laying, but there's two sticks in the yard somewhere. She starts off. She goes out in the yard. She looks around. Oh, how hot the screams from the city. The night prowers coming in, scrambling along, drinking their wines and so forth. She looks down the street, she sees nothing. She finds one stick, part of the cross, self-sacrifice. She gets another piece of the stick. And when she picked up the stick and A STICK, HOW GLOOMY IT MUST HAVE BEEN. GAS LAYING AT THE DOOR. HER AND HER SON HAD TO EAT ONE LITTLE PIECE OF A whole cake and die. That was all evident. Sometimes right in the midst of the gloom that we hear the voice. [panting] When she picked up that second stick and started back, there was a voice came over the gate and said, "Fetch me a little water and a vessel." She turned to look with these two sticks in her hand with the meal and the oil mixed and ready. And she said she dressed mixed it together. The word, the spirit has to mix. Lay it upon the cross of self-sacrifice to deny ANYTHING THAT'S CONTRARY to what you've asked. Lord, children. It shows to me how ignorant sometimes people can be. Do you understand there's people in the message, even preachers, that won't even quote any quotes prior to 1963. Of course, they missed the Holy Ghost series. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That might not have been the only thing they missed out of that part. What a message [sighs and gasps] God gave our prophet. Thank you, Lord. That's right. I MIXED IT. NOW, I'M GOING TO GET THESE STICKS. And that voice said, "Bring me a drink of water in a vessel." She charged back with the sticks in her hand. The voice thundered again. Not only do you share your water, but bring me a little morsel of bread in your hand. Bread of life. Water of life. Was it of life? Question mark. Should die as soon as that perished. What we hear then next? But fetch me a little cake first. Can you believe this man would have the audacity? &gt;&gt; Yeah. after she tells him, "I've only got a handful of meal and a little bit of oil, AND WHENEVER ME AND MY SON EAT IT, WE'RE GOING TO DIE." HE SAID, "NO, NO, NO, NO WAY. NO WAY. MAKE ME one first, &gt;&gt; and you're a servant of God. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE A PROPHET OF GOD. DIDN'T YOU HEAR WHAT I JUST SAID TO YOU? THIS IS ALL I'VE GOT LEFT. WE'RE ABOUT TO DIE." AND YOU WOULD TAKE THAT FROM MY BABY'S MOUTH? NO, not exactly. &gt;&gt; Sometime God requires a seed. &gt;&gt; Sort of like this. You're asking God to heal you. No manifestation there yet. You're waiting till you get healed where you can turn a testimony in, where you can praise God. Sometimes God wants the seed before you ever get your healing manifested. I'm praising you, Lord, because I believe you're going to do it. &gt;&gt; You know what? And you give him THAT SEED AND HE'LL turn right around. And if you'll believe him, he'll take care of you just like he did her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; OH MY. NO MATTER WHAT ANYBODY ELSE SAYS, WHATEVER IT IS, HOW GLOOMY IT LOOKS, WHATEVER IT MAY BE, TAKE GOD FIRST. DOCTOR SAID I can't GET WELL, BUT HIS WORD FIRST. I'M TOO MUCH OF A SINNER. I'M A PROSTITUTE. I'M A GAMBLER. I'M A DRUNKER. GOD'S WORD FIRST. THOUGH YOUR SINS BE SCARLET, THEY SHALL BE AS WHITE AS SNOW, RED LIKE CRIMSON. THEY WILL BE WHITE LIKE WOOL FIRST. GOD, &gt;&gt; bring me a little cake first. And Elijah said unto HER, "FEAR NOT. GO AND DO AS THOU WAS SAID, BUT BRING ME THEREOF a little cake first and bring it unto me after make for thee and THY SON. AND HE SAID, BUT FIRST MAKE ME A CAKE. SEEK YE first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all things will be added unto you. Put God first. Put God first. God's word first. God's principles first. Children, I wonder how this little simple thought would totally transform our lives if we'd put him first in everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Above your feelings, above your emotions, above what you're going through. &gt;&gt; Put his word first, put his spirit first, put him first. Instead of that, we put him last. BRING ME A LITTLE CAKE FIRST. WHAT'S SHE GOING TO DO? SEE, HE'S obedient to the word. She turns and starts not knowing why she's doing it. Men and women who LET THE SPIRIT OF GOD SOMETIME DO THINGS THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY'RE DOING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. TURNED AND STARTED INTO THE HOUSE. THEN SHE HEARD THAT VOICE AGAIN, THAT GLORIOUS WORD COME FROM HIS MOUTH. THUS SAITH the Lord. She knew who it was. Then the barrel will not be empty. Neither shall the cruise run down drown till the day the Lord God sends rain on the earth. Why? She was willing. She put God first. &gt;&gt; This enticing spirits and I'll close you in a moment. Give me a preacher. Give me a Christian. Give me a housewife that's a Christian. A farmer. A factory worker that'll put God first in everything. I'll show you a man that'll be successful in spite of all the devil can put on him. Oh, I'd like to have a bunch more Christians like that filling up these chairs at Word OF LIFE CHURCH THAT PUT GOD FIRST AT WORK. THEY PUT GOD FIRST AT HOME. THEY PUT GOD FIRST IN WHATEVER THEY DO. AND THEY'LL BE SUCCESSFUL IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING. CAN YOU IMAGINE GETTING UP IN THE MORNING AND the devil's GOING TO GRABBING THEIR HEADS AND SCREAMING DOWN IN HELL, "GOOD LORD, HE SURVIVED ANOTHER NIGHT. THERE SHE IS. SHE LIVED THROUGH THE NIGHT. LORD HAVE MERCY. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? WE TRIED THIS AND THAT AND THE OTHER. I'VE DONE USED EVERYTHING ON MY LIST. I'VE DONE EVERYTHING I KNOW TO DO." AND THE DEVIL SAID, "GO ON BACK UP THERE AND KEEP TRYING. THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY, DEVIL. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET AROUND HER." AND SHE GETS ALL DOWN AND ALL WORE OUT AND SHE GETS IN HER CLOSET AND HER PRAYING, GOES TO TALK IN SOME KIND OF LANGUAGE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT EVEN IS. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, SHE JUMPS UP OUT OF THERE. AND IT'S LIKE SHE'S GOT A DYNAMITE ON THE INSIDE OF HER. AND THEN I HAVE TO COME [screaming] RUNNING BACK DOWN TO HELL CUZ I'M TERRIFIED. &gt;&gt; Of course, most of us just GET UP. OH GOD, I'LL LIVE FOR ANOTHER NIGHT. OH NO. OH LORD HAVE MERCY. OH GOD, TAKE ME, KILL ME, TAKE ME TO HEAVEN. I DON'T WANT TO LIVE ANOTHER DAY. &gt;&gt; You need to get some zeal. You need to GET A DESIRE. &gt;&gt; GET IN THE WILL OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. [sighs] [gasps] &gt;&gt; I got a few phone numbers I could call some preachers if y'all want me to call somebody here for Sunday. She made the cake. She give it to the prophet. She went back and made some for her son and herself. But whoa, whoa, whoa. But now, wait a minute. She only had, according to her own testimony, she only had one handful of meal and a little bit of a but she made the prophet one first. Where did it come from? How did it get there? Scientifically, tell me where did that meal come from? Where did that OIL COME FROM? HOW DID IT GET IN the cruise? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She poured it dry. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Every [clears throat] morning, &gt;&gt; Carol, I just about run around my pickup when I was down there today. Listen to this. cuz something clicked to me and I realized I thought that's exactly right. That's the way we are today sometimes. WE THE BLESSING OF GOD COMES SO GREAT and it just seemed like it's gone the next day. We say, "Well, what in the world? Where's where's that LEFTOVER OF THAT POWERFUL SERVICE WE WAS IN?" [snorts] &gt;&gt; MY GOODNESS. ANYBODY KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? &gt;&gt; SHE POURED IT DRY EVERY [screaming] MORNING. SHE EMPTIED THE MEAL barrel every morning and it was dry. Thank you, Lord. [snorts] But when she went back for more, there it is. When she went back for more, it was there. &gt;&gt; Ain't that like our God? OH, SO IT AIN'T LIKE EVERY DAY. I MEAN, HERE'S THIS BIG 55GALLON DRUM AND I MEAN, JUST BOUGHT IT OUT. SHE SHOULD CLEAN IT OUT EVERY DAY. WHY? IT'S A CONTINUAL FAITH WALK. &gt;&gt; SO, IT AIN'T LIKE FAITH WAS APPROPRIATED ONE TIME. OKAY, THAT'S IT. PRAISE GOD. THAT'S IT, MAN. I don't have to do anything else. All I got to do is say, get fattest big rat in a barrel. I'M ONLY A MAN ALIVE. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY AWESOME. BUT EVERY TIME SHE'D CLEAN IT OUT, BY THE WAY, SHE'D HAVE TO SAY, "BUT THE SAME GOD THAT FILLED IT UP YESTERDAY, WE'LL FILL IT UP TODAY." OH, LORD, I'M I'M JUST REMINDED. I'M JUST SAYING ALL THE CORNBREAD'S GONE. ALL THE FRITTERS IS GONE. I MEAN, ALL THAT'S GONE. LORD, I'M JUST SAYING I AIN'T WORRIED ABOUT IT CUZ I DONE SEEN WHAT YOU CAN DO. AND I KNOW THAT YOU IS. I DONE KNOW THAT YOU IS. AND I KNOW THERE AIN'T NOBODY LIKE YOU. YOU'RE A MIGHTY GOD. YOU WILL PROVIDE ALL I NEED. LORD, I AM CERTAIN OF THAT. [applause] [laughter] When she went back for more, it was there. &gt;&gt; Where did it come from? Take God at his word. Be certain of God. He's a creator. You might have lost your health. might have lost your fellowship. Take him at his word. Be certain that he's God. The gloomy times it's looking now may not look so gloomy if you'll take his word and be certain that he's God. Let me close with this. In Germany once I saw a picture and it's always stuck with me. A German painter had painted the picture that's called the cloudland. And when you see it off at a distance, it's the horriblest looking gloom you ever seen. Just clouds matted together. When you're looking at it from a long distance, but when you get real close to it, it changes and it's angel's wings beaten together. Now remember what we've been talking about in your little diary box, little bride. Here you go. Here's another view of angels. It's angels wings beaten together singing hallelujah to the Lord. So that's what gloom is sometime. Wow. I need help tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; You mean a lot of times God has hung this great work of art and I thought it was gloom and doom. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it was actually a multitude of angels. I felt so alone. That's right. &gt;&gt; And I thought he was nowhere around the gloom and the darkness and the despair, whatever you're going through. So that's what gloom is. Sometimes if you look at it at a long distance, it looks gloomy and dark, but take God at his word and be certain that he's God and move up close to it and you'll find out it's just angel's wings beaten together. Stand together. So, are you certain of God tonight? No matter what you're facing, maybe you've got a wavered son or two or three or two, three daughters plus husband, father. Maybe your family's going through something you ever thought you'd go through. Maybe it's your church family. You know how it is. When we get hurt by people, then it makes us question other people. makes us uncertain about other people. That's why you need to put your certainty up this way. &gt;&gt; Be certain of God. Cuz you know as well as I do, all of us have made plenty of mistakes. Anybody in here that hasn't made a mistake since you become a Christian? Anybody in here that hasn't made a mistake today &gt;&gt; within the last 10 seconds? Anybody? So we can't be even be certain about oursel. &gt;&gt; Oh, we can always look up this way and say, I know I can trust him. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I know I can be certain about him. So maybe you ain't got a handful of meal tonight in the service. Maybe just a teaspoon is all you got. And just a few drops of oil is what you're containing there. And all you got out of the service, you sat there and you was fighting the devil. And I was running up here like I'm wild, man. You're thinking, "What in the world's the matter with him? What is he doing?" And you just you got a little word here, a little word there. It don't take that much really. So if you got just a little bit and a drop or two of oil and if you'll mix it together, you may not need a cross no bigger than two match stems, but climb up on there and say, "Lord, I don't feel one bit better. The situation ain't changed one, but I'm going to praise you like it's already happened." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. I'm going to love you cuz your Bible says the joy of the Lord is my strength and I'm tired of being sick. I'm tired of being beat down. I'm tired of not having no joy. So, I'm going to sacrifice tonight and I'm going to raise both of my hands &gt;&gt; and close my eyes and worship you &gt;&gt; like I feel it &gt;&gt; even though I don't. And I don't know how long it's been since I felt anything, &gt;&gt; but I'm going to put my praise on the cross and offer it to you. It hurts my arms. It hurts my back. Lord, I can't hold them up long. The Lord understands. The Lord understands if it hurts you. He does. But you know what? He loves you so much. And he wants your praise so much. If you can only praise him for 10 or 15 seconds and it's from your heart and you have to put your hands back down. It's, "Oh Lord, I'm so sorry." He said, "That's okay. Rest a few, then put it back up again." That's good. That's good. Then rest a few, and then put it back up again. Praise the Lord. What are you doing? You're learning to die on your cross. So, what little bit of word that you got out of this sermon tonight, mixed with what little bit of oil that you got left, mix it up in that teen, tiny little tiny tiny mixing bowl there in your heart. Just [laughter] and they say, "Okay, Jesus. I got it mixed up." And now I'm going to climb up on this cross with me and hit together. And I want to say I thank you that you are. &gt;&gt; You always will be. &gt;&gt; You're my I am. You're my everything. &gt;&gt; You're my mighty God. Whatever I need, you are. Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; S. &gt;&gt; Can we bury our heads tonight? [clears throat] Oh, hallelujah. Lord Jesus, I pray, Father, that you'd help each of us now as we open our hearts. Not only those in the visible audience, but Father, those that streaming as well. Lord, you alone know all those that are streaming and what they're going through at this time of their life and the things that they faced and what they're going through and family difficulties, church difficulties. You know how discouraging life can be sometimes, Lord. And it's like your prophet said it so well that sometimes you sat silent or you lay silent is the word that he used. Lord, we want to be the kind of people that even in those silent days that we trust and we believe and we know you're still God. For when in reality we know that more than likely we'll have more silent days than we will those thundering thus sayaith the Lord days. But it was those silent days that the woman had that led up to the Elijah visit that brought out the thundering voice of God out of that prophet's lips. If she had not been faithful in those silent days, Elijah would no doubt never have visited her. But it was her faithfulness in the silence that brought the voice of God. Lord, may we look ahead in time and realize as we are faithful through the trials and the test of life and may go through these silent periods in our life. Lord, our faithfulness and those silent days will culminate in that one day that we're all waiting for when the voice of the resurrection will speak and our loved ones will raise. And that same voice will speak to us and our bodies will be changed in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye. It will be worth all the silent times we've had. All the silent days. Then, Lord Jesus, when we get caught up, the days of silence will be over. For our faith is no longer being tested and tried. Faith is now turned into sight. And at that day, we'll need no more faith. Faith will have culminated and produced its work. And then we'll be able to see you, touch you, &gt;&gt; and you will touch us. &gt;&gt; We'll set across that great table at that wedding supper. Glory to God. And we'll reach across that table to those battle scarred soldiers. And we'll hug one another and hug one another's shake one another's hands. And each one of us, the lamb will come down through there, stop by our side. And we'll raise our head from talking and fellowshipping with those around us. And we'll look up in your face and the tears will stream down our face. Maybe the last time we'll ever cry tears. I don't know. But she'll take her garment, put it in your hand, and rub it in her eyes and say, "Don't cry no more. It's all over." Oh Jesus, we live for that day. We live for that hour. Lord, help us tonight. Father, Lord, may each of us take our little meal and our little bit of oil, mix it together, may we take the two sticks. When that little fire is lit under it on the cross, it will transform those two elements into one. They will be made a cake. Praise God. We don't want to just be bride seed, but we actually want to become bread on your table. That's what your prophet teaches us also in harvest time. For we know the 12 loaves that was on the table of shoebre. And that word shoebre is bread of his face or bread of his presence. So that bread was set before your face, your presence, each loaf representing a tribe. In the Gentile dispensation, you had seven loaves, one representing one age, one another, one another, one another, on down to the seventh. And what will the rapture be? the New Testament table of shoebre, the bread of your face. So we don't want to just be seed, but we want to be transformed into bread. For you were also seed, but you also said, "I am that bread which came down from heaven." Take our lives, Lord. bring us to maturity and then allow that seed to be transformed. Hallelujah. Into the bread of your face. Granted, Lord God, we worship you tonight, Lord Jesus. May some of them ain't felt you in a good while, Lord. And in reality, they ain't even felt like praising you. But may they raise their hands right here tonight, lift their voices, raise their head as it was up into your presence and climb up on that cross with their hands uplifted and say, "Jesus, I love you. I believe you. I trust you. I know that you are. I know that you are. Praise God. Praise God. Whatever your need is tonight, friends, you believe whatever you want to believe. I believe almighty God directed me this way tonight. And I know if he did, he did it for a purpose. May not be for one purp, one person. Maybe two, three. I don't know. It's up to him. I ain't worried about numbers. My concern is obeying him. Amen. &gt;&gt; If he spoke to you tonight, why don't you open your heart to her, little bride, little woman from Zarapath, you little gentile, God sent an Elijah message your way with thus saith the Lord. A sustenance, a sustenance that'll keep you in hard times. What is it? Spiritual food in due season. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Sing something for us.
