[8:46] us to even begin to say sufficiently how
[8:49] thankful you are I remember that prophet

[9:37] of the squeeze all part of the promise
[9:38] we know that it's got to be that way
[9:42] before the children of Israel left Egypt
[9:43] the taskmasters get harder and got
[9:45] harder and more strict and harder upon
[9:48] them and it had to be right before

[26:38] this read in revelation 22 if you would
[26:40] verse 12 through verses 14 and behold I
[26:50] come quickly and my reward is with me to
[26:54] give every man according as his work
[26:56] shall be my mouth and Omega at the
[26:59] beginning and the end the first and the
[27:01] last bus it are they that do His
[27:04] commandments that they may have right to
[27:07] the Tree of Life and may enter in
[27:11] through the gates into the city and we'd
[27:16] like to be remembered today as we pray
[27:19] just bow our heads if we would and
[27:21] reverence to the Lord our gracious
[27:25] loving father we thank you today for the
[27:28] opportunity once again to stand in your
[27:31] presence for Jesus we ask father that
[27:35] you would help us first of all forgive
[27:38] us of our shortcomings our trespasses
[27:41] our failures our mistakes which I know
[27:45] are many but we thank you Lord that
[27:49] truth and righteousness mercy and peace
[27:55] have met and resolve has been brought
[28:00] between them Lord Jesus we ask today
[28:04] father that should take your word and
[28:06] speak to our hearts we've come to your
[28:09] table once again and as always we're
[28:13] hungry we're needy
[28:15] we're thirsty we love you Lord your
[28:21] grace and mercy and ways are hard for us
[28:26] to explain it's it's something that we
[28:30] never thirst for again once we get it
[28:32] but we never get enough so it's likely
[28:37] once we find it it's what we've been
[28:40] looking for all of our life
[28:42] but it makes us want so much more it's a
[28:46] mystery to us but we love you today and
[28:49] we just ask you that should help us on
[28:50] the service father speak to us your word
[28:53] we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus
[28:57] Amen god bless you may be seated
[29:04] as you know I've got a very old direct
[29:07] life to the service today but we've got
[29:11] too many wonderful things to look at
[29:13] today to rush so if I get one third of
[29:19] it said that's fine one tenth one
[29:22] hundred that doesn't really matter what
[29:25] we want to do is follow the channel
[29:27] today of the Lord I don't like putting
[29:29] God on no timeframe deve certainly one
[29:34] of their hearts to be open to him today
[29:36] as we believe that we're a people that
[29:40] are privileged to live in the last day
[29:42] and the end time and know the wonderful
[29:45] things that God has done is doing and
[29:48] believing that the atmosphere that we
[29:52] are living in the world that we're
[29:54] living in is certainly under an
[29:56] influence of two supernatural world's
[30:00] the world's above us the world's beneath
[30:02] us as we've been reading it for a few
[30:05] weeks to draw a conclusion to help us to
[30:07] see why people do the way they do why
[30:10] they live the way they live it's not
[30:13] just by mortal choice we know that
[30:16] because man in the Garden of Eden of
[30:19] course was placed on that basis to be
[30:22] able to choose right from wrong and
[30:24] which way to go but yet there was
[30:27] greater influence and the Garden of Eden
[30:29] then what was visible to the natural eye
[30:33] that was the influence of The Tree of
[30:35] Life and the influence of another being
[30:37] which was there and we know that that
[30:40] influence is still ongoing today been
[30:43] looking at the tree of life and restored
[30:46] fruit that God desires to be on the
[30:48] broad tree in the last day and last week
[30:52] we looked at peace and what a great
[30:54] thing
[30:55] pease truly is is it not we know that
[30:58] peace has certainly been taken from the
[31:00] earth in the measure that God had it
[31:03] there's no way that you and I can
[31:05] comprehend today Eve and those of us
[31:06] that are filled with the Holy Ghost the
[31:08] amount of peace the quantity of peace
[31:12] and the quality of peace that existed in
[31:16] the earth before man ever fail what we
[31:19] know today even with the baptism of the
[31:22] Holy Ghost as wonderful as it is and
[31:24] what God has restored to us by that it
[31:28] would pale in comparison to what that
[31:30] peace must have been and the paradise of
[31:33] God and yet we know that he desires to
[31:36] restore us back to that place I believe
[31:39] that with all of my heart as we get
[31:41] closer and closer to the influence of
[31:44] heaven itself expressing itself upon the
[31:47] earth I believe God desires the fruit of
[31:51] his own life of his own nature to sow
[31:54] permeate us if he'll is influencing the
[31:58] people that on the earth and they are
[32:00] reflecting hell acting like hell talking
[32:03] like the attributes of hell then truly
[32:06] there must be an influence of people on
[32:09] the earth that are going to be able to
[32:10] reflect God's grace I believe that don't
[32:13] you
[32:13] and we know that the Prophet told us it
[32:16] will jump down the middle of this quote
[32:18] here you cannot be a spiritual being
[32:19] sinner or Saint without having an
[32:22] influence from the underworld or from
[32:25] the above world your influence from here
[32:28] if you're from above your celestial body
[32:30] is waiting up here if you're wicked
[32:32] hypocritical and indifferent your
[32:35] celestial body is down here regardless
[32:38] of how much you think it's up here
[32:39] because the fruit that you bear before
[32:42] people proves not just where you're
[32:45] going but where you're from so you are
[32:49] here what you are somewhere else your
[32:53] life that you live here is just a
[32:56] reflecting of what your inheritance is
[32:59] when you leave here we believe that with
[33:03] all of our hearts and we know that this
[33:05] is the reason the darkness is so
[33:07] pressing
[33:08] and the age and the hour we're living
[33:10] because hail according to the Old
[33:13] Testament prophet has opened up her
[33:16] gates and the influence of hail is so
[33:18] pressing out it's hard to believe that
[33:20] our world our nation is reeling under
[33:24] the impact of such darkness and yet no
[33:26] matter what we do we will never reverse
[33:29] it it'll never be reversed under Jesus
[33:31] comes and takes it over again we could
[33:34] put an Abraham Lincoln and have to be in
[33:37] mayor of every town we could put a
[33:39] George Washington to be the governor we
[33:41] could put all these great men that have
[33:44] been our forefathers at Thomas Jefferson
[33:45] to be able to be in in every little
[33:48] magistrate we would never reverse it
[33:51] because the cycle of darkness is moving
[33:55] and hailed as so emptying out it's as if
[33:58] though that God is allowing it to come
[34:01] to such a place you my know that it's
[34:03] been this way in previous times before
[34:06] before the and alluvium destruction
[34:08] there was such a violence that moved
[34:10] upon the earth and it's one of the signs
[34:12] of destruction that moved upon the earth
[34:15] in the days before Noah received a
[34:18] revelation from God that a flood was
[34:20] going to come and the Bible mentions the
[34:23] horrific sins that was there and one of
[34:25] the things that so stood out to the
[34:28] author of the book of Genesis was
[34:30] violence was upon the face of the earth
[34:33] and we can see that saying reoccurring
[34:36] again we see also under the
[34:38] administration of the Red Horse under
[34:41] the opening of the second seal that
[34:44] great power was given to the rider of
[34:47] the Red Horse that he would take peace
[34:51] from the inhabitants of the earth now we
[34:55] know that peace has not been here like
[34:59] it should have been since the very fall
[35:01] of man but yet through this we see that
[35:04] somehow the administration which the red
[35:08] of course was a symbolism of a color the
[35:10] horse or the symbolism of a power and
[35:12] the
[35:13] upon there was an administration by
[35:16] which all of that coming together that
[35:18] through that power was given war and the
[35:21] war one war after another after another
[35:24] and by that it pulled peace from the
[35:27] inhabitants of the earth so they came
[35:30] through a cycle on the earths that they
[35:32] were able to have peace and then war
[35:34] would come and then that have peace and
[35:36] war would come and we know that the
[35:39] merging together of these swine horse
[35:41] riders and the colours of the horses is
[35:43] consummating in the end time to wind up
[35:46] in the pale horse so we know that peace
[35:49] again is certainly being taken from the
[35:52] inhabitants of the earth but on the
[35:54] other hand the real peace of God I
[35:57] believe is being restored as part of the
[36:00] fruit to those that are under the
[36:02] influence of the Holy Ghost
[36:04] oh don't you appreciate the peace of God
[36:06] now we know that mercy and truth must
[36:09] have a place of reconciliation the
[36:13] justice of God must be met with the
[36:16] truth of God God cannot be able to
[36:19] require something of man and say that
[36:22] man must be able to answer for all of
[36:25] this that he's done wrong and then God
[36:27] turned the blind eyes it was but there
[36:30] must be a place of reconciliation to
[36:33] where that justice can be met notice
[36:36] this in Psalms 29 11 the Lord will give
[36:40] strength unto his people the Lord will
[36:44] bless his people with peace a man the
[36:51] Lord will give strength unto his people
[36:54] the Lord will bless his people I want
[36:58] you to notice the designation of divine
[37:01] peace is not given to all the
[37:04] inhabitants of the earth it's not
[37:07] promised even those who just go to
[37:09] church but it's promised to those who
[37:12] are his people so if you today are
[37:16] struggling with the lack of peace and
[37:18] your walk with God this is one of your
[37:21] scriptures
[37:22] you need to write down and be able to
[37:24] quote it over and over again until this
[37:28] promise of God is made manifest in your
[37:31] life all beloved ani you don't know all
[37:34] I'm going through you're right I don't
[37:36] know all you're going through but I know
[37:38] this promise is greater than all you are
[37:42] going through so God gives us his word
[37:45] and it's up to us to take that promise
[37:48] of the word and we water that promise
[37:51] every day was praised and we allow God
[37:55] to bring that promise to pass in our
[37:58] lives right let me read it again the
[38:01] Lord will give strengthen to his people
[38:03] and the Lord will bless his people with
[38:07] peace again Psalms 37 11 but the meek
[38:12] shall inherit the earth and shall
[38:15] delight themselves in the abundance of
[38:17] peace they hear the psalmist David moves
[38:20] plumb over into the millennial reign of
[38:22] the son of David and he's able to
[38:25] capture by inspiration what's going to
[38:29] transpire when the Lord Jesus is ruling
[38:32] and reigning upon the earth and he said
[38:35] the meek shall inherit the earth
[38:37] and shall delight themselves in the
[38:40] abundance of peace now remember David
[38:43] was a prophet he was a different profit
[38:46] than Jeremiah Seco zephaniah haggai and
[38:48] so on but yet he was a prophet and David
[38:51] was able to catch this in the future
[38:54] tense that the meek would actually
[38:56] inherit the earth and that they would
[38:59] delight themselves in the abundance so
[39:02] it wasn't that in the Millennium that
[39:04] there would be you know a rationing of
[39:06] peace and we have to be careful with how
[39:08] much peace that we have because God does
[39:11] not have enough to go around but there
[39:13] will be an abundance of peace well let
[39:16] me just give you a little bit of insight
[39:18] I believe there's an abundance right now
[39:21] if we can be able to move beyond the
[39:23] worries the fears the dreads of life and
[39:26] be able to break into the Avenue by
[39:28] which are abundant God has supplied it
[39:31] for us again Psalms 37 37 marked the
[39:36] perfect man and behold the upright for
[39:40] the end of that man is peace praise God
[39:46] the end of that man is peace notice
[39:51] again in Psalms 85 10 now again the
[39:54] Prophet David able to break into the
[39:57] inspiration and no doubt the man did not
[39:59] even have a clue brother John the ending
[40:02] of the fulfillment of what he was fixing
[40:05] to say because inspiration would come to
[40:07] these men they didn't always know why
[40:09] they didn't know why they were saying it
[40:12] this way they probably didn't even have
[40:14] the full comprehension I'm sure when
[40:16] this come out of the utterance of
[40:18] David's mouth or by the pen by which he
[40:20] was writing it that he must have
[40:22] unrolled it but the gene and looked at
[40:24] it and marveled to the great meaning of
[40:27] it and he says mercy and truths are met
[40:31] together righteousness and peace have
[40:35] kissed each other listen to this again
[40:38] mercy and truth are men together now
[40:43] watch as David sets forth about the
[40:46] Justice of God knowing that God was a
[40:49] just God and then what God sets forth
[40:52] the penalty of law disobedience and then
[40:55] God said that the penalty of disobedient
[40:58] to his wall is death then that can never
[41:01] be eradicated until the justice of God
[41:04] is met so here goes mercy and truth
[41:08] mercy heads in one direction truth heads
[41:11] in another and here they come and they
[41:14] meet in the way one of them
[41:17] seeking for the Inquisition of truth to
[41:21] punish those who have broken the Justice
[41:24] of God the other one is searching for a
[41:27] way by which this can the penalty can be
[41:30] met and offered to those who desire it a
[41:34] way to release them and somehow they
[41:38] meet in the way and when they meet in
[41:42] the way their differences supernaturally
[41:45] are reconciled and when they are met
[41:48] praise be to God when they are met in
[41:52] the way they meet in the way one
[41:54] searching for the Inquisition of sin
[41:57] they are doing that the other ones
[41:59] searching for reconciliation and David
[42:02] said mercy and truth are met together
[42:05] and licit the fruit of it righteousness
[42:08] and peace have kissed each other so
[42:12] righteousness is given to truth and
[42:14] peace is given to mercy and they were
[42:18] met in the way with opposite goals with
[42:21] opposite intentions yet they were met in
[42:25] one place where it was that way it was
[42:28] that way in Saint John when he said I am
[42:32] the way the truth and the life any man
[42:36] that will come to the Father must come
[42:38] by me in him was mercy and truth and
[42:43] righteousness and peace met in the way
[42:46] and reconciliation to what God has been
[42:50] resolved
[42:52] please mister God it was meant by the
[42:57] price of our lovely Lord Jesus rendering
[43:00] to us what the Inquisition has been
[43:04] solved and the resolve has been met
[43:07] mercy and grace have kissed each other
[43:10] and we are the progeny of that union
[43:13] Amazing Grace how sweet the sound
[43:17] notice Psalms 119 verse 165 great peace
[43:23] I love this great peace have they which
[43:26] love thy law and nothing shall offend
[43:32] them now freely we taste something I you
[43:35] know most of you have been saved for
[43:36] many many years for a long time as I
[43:38] have as well and one thing that I've
[43:40] noticed about a lot of folks you can
[43:43] really tell a lot about words they are
[43:45] you know some people they carried their
[43:47] feelings around on the shoulder and they
[43:49] don't like this in church and they don't
[43:51] like to add in this hurts them and this
[43:52] offends them and that hurts them and
[43:54] what I found out a lot of times through
[43:56] the years is that most of the time those
[43:59] folks that are so easily offended about
[44:01] everything it's not that there's so many
[44:04] offenses that are around but whether the
[44:07] reality of the problem is themselves
[44:09] they don't love the Lord right so they
[44:12] go to church with this and all I didn't
[44:15] like this and I didn't like that you
[44:17] know really that they're not even
[44:18] satisfied with life in reality they're
[44:21] just not satisfied with anything in life
[44:23] and folks that are troubled with within
[44:26] are always the troublemakers which
[44:28] reflect that trouble without people that
[44:31] have deep peace was in they are
[44:34] peacemakers and they reflect that peace
[44:36] was out so people that just profess
[44:39] peace by their mouths but are really
[44:42] troubled within their soul you watch
[44:44] everywhere they go no matter whether
[44:46] it's on the job whether it's in school
[44:48] whether it's in college whether it's in
[44:50] church whatever it is they leave a trail
[44:52] behind them of trouble because they are
[44:55] trouble we'll send them
[44:57] but you watch a person who has accepted
[45:00] the volume of the book the Word of God
[45:02] and they have transitioned by the grace
[45:05] of God into a sphere or a realm of peace
[45:09] you watch the trail of that individual
[45:11] and they will leave behind them one
[45:13] trial one mark after another after
[45:16] another of being a peacemaker because
[45:19] it's not in them to go around and cause
[45:22] conflict and trouble because our God is
[45:25] not the author of confusion but of peace
[45:30] notice David said great peace have they
[45:33] what's love thy law and nothing shall
[45:36] offend them now today if you really love
[45:39] the Lord Jesus right and you come here
[45:42] to church for five years and within that
[45:44] period of five years you're never able
[45:46] to shake my hand you're never able to be
[45:49] able to get some you know some close
[45:50] intimate time and me and my wife or say
[45:53] with the Deacons or whatever more and
[45:55] nobody ever brags on you nobody ever
[45:57] lifts you up and calls your name and
[45:59] says yes sweet and good and then all
[46:01] that sort of thing you are in that Bay
[46:03] yet God's revealed to you this is what
[46:05] you're supposed to go to church and you
[46:07] love him and you love his word you know
[46:09] what if nobody ever speaks to you from
[46:11] now on the rapture you have great peace
[46:13] because you love God's Word but if
[46:16] you're looking to be patted on the back
[46:18] and rubbed around and hanging like a
[46:20] little baby doll and we've got to give
[46:21] you a pacifier and a box of Pampers and
[46:24] that sort of thing well you're at the
[46:25] wrong place I'll tell you that right now
[46:27] and no matter how many papers we would
[46:30] give you and a box of pacifiers and
[46:31] suckers you'll never be at peace until
[46:34] you get that peace within yourself great
[46:38] peace
[46:39] they they love thy law and nothing shall
[46:41] athina look at the value I'm convinced
[46:44] friends that for many people they do not
[46:47] hold peace and high esteem and high
[46:50] value even whenever it comes to family
[46:52] arguments and family dissertations
[46:55] what's most important to a lot of people
[46:57] is that they get their point across and
[47:00] that you see their point and they will
[47:04] not shut up until you agree they are
[47:07] right you know why because that's what
[47:10] they esteem the most valued instead of
[47:13] peace and whatever you've argued and
[47:19] fussed and debated and you've proved
[47:21] your point what have you really
[47:22] accomplished because for the most part
[47:25] when you get done all they've done is
[47:27] agree to shut you up anyway and they
[47:30] still believe what they believe before
[47:32] you argued with them all they done is
[47:34] finally give in and you just they said
[47:36] you know they're sick of hearing your
[47:38] blabber mouth so they just arrived right
[47:40] right you're right you're right you're
[47:41] always right they don't believe that
[47:43] they don't believe that no you're the
[47:46] only one that believes that because
[47:47] you've just saved yourself
[47:56] but if we really valued peace we would
[47:59] understand that it's not just us proving
[48:03] our point and trying to get the other
[48:05] person to agree with our point but the
[48:08] value would be peace I love peace listen
[48:17] to this proverbs 16:7 what a man's ways
[48:21] please the Lord he make us he don't ask
[48:32] us he don't say is it okay us he make us
[48:39] his enemies you know why many of us have
[48:45] so many enemies and they're constantly
[48:47] honest it's our fault it's because our
[48:52] ways don't please God I notice God don't
[48:57] always make your enemies your friends
[48:59] that's not the scripture that's not the
[49:02] Marvel that God would actually make your
[49:05] enemies your friends but God will
[49:08] actually make your enemies to be at
[49:11] peace of where they just finally leave
[49:13] you alone oh well I guess I can close
[49:20] now notice it how many believe this is
[49:24] the Bible you believe it's the truth now
[49:27] maybe you're having a problem with
[49:29] someone or more than someone maybe two
[49:32] or three someone's or somebodies you
[49:34] need to apply the scripture to your life
[49:36] and make it one of your professions that
[49:39] God will take and make this word alive
[49:42] to you now would you believe it search
[49:45] was so done of course Solomon wrote this
[49:47] and he said when a man's ways please the
[49:50] Lord he maketh
[49:52] even his enemies to be at peace with him
[49:57] why because the man is so desirous to
[50:00] please God now he's not trying to please
[50:02] his enemies you see that's where many
[50:04] people that misunderstand peace because
[50:07] they think that they have to compromise
[50:09] in order to be able to have peace no
[50:12] it's not pleasing the individual it's
[50:16] pleasing the Lord and then when you
[50:20] please the Lord the Lord will actually
[50:23] make earth as you see as always it's us
[50:25] trying to do it
[50:27] then we take it out of God's hands but
[50:30] if we will please the Lord the Lord will
[50:33] make our enemies to be a peaceful Jacob
[50:40] Omer Jacob was followed by his
[50:43] father-in-law by a truth of men was bad
[50:48] intentions he was met by his brother was
[50:54] another truth of men was bad intentions
[51:00] but when Jacob got to a place where he
[51:03] could surrender all to God both of them
[51:06] cunning what's a trunk one of him left
[51:12] him with a kiss and the other met him
[51:14] with one and comedy's I'm taking my
[51:24] daughters I'm taking these sheep I'm
[51:26] taking these goats and God said no
[51:29] you're not Jacob belongs to me
[51:35] [Applause]
[51:39] so your comes late and with bad and
[51:42] since I'm taking you to court I'm doing
[51:44] this I'm doing that on the other and God
[51:46] said are you really no I'll tell you
[51:50] what you're gonna do Jacob you are gonna
[51:53] leave humbly and you're gonna kiss him
[51:56] on the way out
[51:59] that he's so here's incoming Jacob's
[52:02] come and shake and comer and I saw said
[52:04] I'll tell you one thing I'll get that
[52:06] sorry brother am i lowdown sorry rascal
[52:10] God said really God said no I'll tell
[52:15] what you're gonna do mr. bigshot Esau
[52:18] you're gonna humble yourself and you're
[52:21] gonna kiss your brother
[52:23] [Applause]
[52:32] Laban leaves for the nose he saw leaves
[52:36] the tears both of them leave with peace
[52:42] on a man's ways please little but wonder
[52:46] why this didn't happen before now j-stop
[52:49] had not met God in the way of pineal
[52:55] that one Jacob comes to that spot maybe
[53:05] it's you Jeremiah chapter 29 verse 11 I
[53:18] know the thoughts but I think towards
[53:26] you say Lord thoughts of peace and not
[53:38] of evil to give you and expected and
[53:46] what if God thinks thoughts of peace
[53:48] toward me well I don't want to have you
[53:51] so much peace cuz my thoughts imagine
[53:54] his
[53:59] you bet God want you to be tormented you
[54:01] bet God would just absolutely hate you
[54:03] and God wants you to barely make it and
[54:05] gonna survive that's nobody's thoughts
[54:11] let us jump to the New Testament it's
[54:14] what's the Lord Jesus how he sits is
[54:18] forth in such a strange peculiar way
[54:21] mark chapter 9 verse 50 salt is good but
[54:34] if the salt have lost his salt miss
[54:41] where will will you seize it have salt
[54:47] in yourselves wow what a recipe for
[54:58] peace so in order to have peace with one
[55:03] another we got to have saltiness now of
[55:12] course this would never work at the UN
[55:14] all the ambassador's to around and Iraq
[55:18] and you know ind in all the places of
[55:20] the world they would never take this on
[55:22] a you know on an emissary to be able to
[55:24] go and said now we are here to bring
[55:26] peace and here's a salt shaker
[55:31] well actually the only way we'll ever
[55:34] have peace among us is for us to become
[55:38] the salt shaker
[55:41] you see Jesus never said carry salt in a
[55:45] bag or go down and buy a box of Morton's
[55:48] iodized salt or get your box of kosher
[55:52] but jesus said in order to have peace
[55:56] among yourselves you've got to have salt
[56:00] I figured job would have that look on
[56:08] your face because that's a look I had
[56:09] when I read this scripture now look at
[56:12] this he says have salt in your cells
[56:15] look at the meaning of the word salt
[56:17] salt is a symbol of the lasting Concord
[56:22] because it protects food from future
[56:26] faction and preserves it unchanged
[56:30] accordingly in the solemn ratification
[56:33] of compacts the Orientals were and are
[56:37] to this day accustomed to perte of salt
[56:42] together so to make meat savory and to
[56:49] keep the flesh from spoiling
[56:56] [Applause]
[57:00] well we can stand dismissed y'all got it
[57:06] so in order to preserve the flash and to
[57:13] keep the flash and a suitable
[57:17] presentable manner praise be to God in
[57:30] this amazing now that the Lord Jesus
[57:33] actually says salt is good but if the
[57:37] salt has lost his saltness and what you
[57:41] notice any places this in the masculine
[57:44] form that the salt is him so for salt
[57:49] have lost his salt miss wherewith shall
[57:54] you recover it now you know if you've
[57:56] had salt very long that in time salt can
[58:00] actually go bad
[58:02] now that sermon kill my brother sister
[58:05] Larry that was there in Israel as well
[58:07] and we went down to the Dead Sea and of
[58:09] course it's salts everywhere the great
[58:12] content of salt that's in the sea itself
[58:14] but you could walk around on the banks
[58:16] and just see pieces of salt laying down
[58:19] there in the dirt but one thing that
[58:21] causes the salt to go bad specially than
[58:24] that area is the mixture of gypsum and
[58:27] other types of elements but this is why
[58:30] that they will purify the salt and get
[58:33] all the elements the long time and
[58:35] gossip I mean you know all these
[58:39] elements how because the salt in itself
[58:42] can keep for years
[58:44] years and years and times and ages and
[58:49] ages until you get all this other stuff
[58:54] mixed in with it and then when you mix
[58:58] all this other stuff in with the salt
[59:00] then you don't keep the flesh subject
[59:04] like it should and they all flash is a
[59:07] stinky old thing come on a heavy Valley
[59:11] the old France is rotten and the old
[59:15] folks don't like to be subject to the
[59:17] world so we got a poor salt in our hide
[59:21] sometimes so I need good hard preaching
[59:30] to Rebbe right good
[59:34] and that same creature that tires you
[59:37] from the top of your head to the bottom
[59:38] of your feet what's he do it'll pour
[59:41] honey in their moons he poor soul now
[59:47] what's amazing is when the Lord Jesus
[59:49] sets his force about this in mark
[59:53] chapter 9 he's actually dealing and
[59:56] referring to something that it happened
[59:59] in mark chapter 9 verses 34 up till that
[1:00:03] verses 47 and that was situations that
[1:00:07] existed among the Apostles himself never
[1:00:10] remember they are elect they are chosen
[1:00:12] but their unregenerate so they can only
[1:00:15] produce a certain element of the word of
[1:00:18] that day without the Holy Ghost
[1:00:20] so Jesus now is going to deal was part
[1:00:25] of their issues and part of their
[1:00:27] problems and said boys I'll tell you
[1:00:29] what you guys problem you only salt now
[1:00:34] this is why you've got these issues now
[1:00:37] let's let's look at these issues and
[1:00:38] Mark chapter 9 verse 33 what's one of
[1:00:42] the things that will prevent peace from
[1:00:45] being in families in churches among
[1:00:48] brothers it is self
[1:00:51] saltation and self-interests if y'all
[1:00:57] like I could finish his sermon me and
[1:00:59] there y'all that here once in mark
[1:01:03] chapter 9 verse 33 never remember this
[1:01:05] is just prior to the Lord Jesus saying
[1:01:07] about soul he came to Capernaum and they
[1:01:09] in the house he asked them what was it
[1:01:12] that you disputed among yourselves by
[1:01:15] the way but they held their peace I've
[1:01:25] been that way a few times myself I've
[1:01:27] seen you all be that same way when the
[1:01:29] Lord gets on you all than y'all hold
[1:01:30] your peace
[1:01:31] you don't say a man you don't say out
[1:01:34] you don't say nothing you just you're
[1:01:35] mummified come on they held their peace
[1:01:41] now notice why they held their peace for
[1:01:43] by the way they had disputed among
[1:01:47] themselves now because they lacked
[1:01:56] saltless within themselves they were
[1:02:00] focusing on who was gonna have the
[1:02:02] biggest ministry who's gonna be the
[1:02:07] biggest preacher who's gonna have the
[1:02:09] biggest Church who's the best singer did
[1:02:13] you notice they clap their hands for me
[1:02:15] more when I sung than they did when you
[1:02:18] son I've got to sing twice in the last
[1:02:21] six months and you've only got to sing
[1:02:23] once you like salt
[1:02:28] now this is Jesus cure for these types
[1:02:32] addition now this is why a lot of times
[1:02:34] that husbands and wives don't get along
[1:02:37] this is why a lot of times siblings
[1:02:39] don't get along
[1:02:41] now sibling rivalry goes plumb back to
[1:02:44] the Garden of Eden and we got time
[1:02:46] together than that that they do it but
[1:02:47] sibling rivalry is still alive and well
[1:02:50] today naturally and spiritually so
[1:02:55] here's the Lord Jesus is pointing back
[1:02:58] and say look boys your problem is lack
[1:03:02] of salt you sisters when you cook do you
[1:03:11] taste it soup pies puddings cakes
[1:03:16] whatever more Oh ain't got enough salt
[1:03:20] stir it up about see what you think what
[1:03:25] is that neat
[1:03:26] cayenne is it garlic is it onion powder
[1:03:28] it's missing something
[1:03:29] now look you have done that long enough
[1:03:31] to know it's not tasting exactly the
[1:03:34] same way it was in acts 2 I mean the
[1:03:37] last time that you made that recipe so
[1:03:41] you see that's what the Lord does see
[1:03:43] well sometimes when he kind of tastes of
[1:03:46] my life and said you're missing onion
[1:03:48] powder you're missing little bit of
[1:03:50] garlic you're missing a little bit of
[1:03:51] axe too
[1:03:54] a little bit of accent for your mixing a
[1:03:56] whole lot of action 30 a why because the
[1:03:59] original recipe produce God in human
[1:04:03] beings we want the same time do we not
[1:04:08] God in human beings on the face of the
[1:04:11] earth
[1:04:12] so God tastes of a love more brotherly
[1:04:17] love and he did that oh ma hmm hmm way
[1:04:24] too sweet too much sugar them folks I
[1:04:30] need some had skimming going on down
[1:04:32] there that pastor lay molasses on them
[1:04:34] all the time and honey
[1:04:35] well I need to send the vengers down
[1:04:37] there that'll burn them up from one side
[1:04:39] down the other
[1:04:45] God said there you go ice what's your
[1:04:47] name I know we don't like it we like
[1:04:51] honey preachers don't we
[1:04:53] oh that's our favorite kind oh ma you
[1:05:00] see another attribute that was missing
[1:05:03] in these boys was bigotry just in case
[1:05:11] you've forgotten what bigotry means I'm
[1:05:13] gonna read you the meaning of it
[1:05:14] obstinate or intolerant devotion to
[1:05:18] one's own opinions and prejudices
[1:05:27] I'll repeat it again for those of you
[1:05:29] who wrote it down and for those of you
[1:05:31] who don't want to dare rather their
[1:05:34] bigotry is abstinent or intolerant
[1:05:37] devotion to one's own opinions a good
[1:05:47] dose of salt takes care of bigotry but
[1:05:49] you have to keep it in there because you
[1:05:51] see the thing of it is were still left
[1:05:53] for a new creation left in this human
[1:05:56] temple and this human temple still has
[1:05:59] rottenness so it ain't like you get it
[1:06:03] cured one time and that's it note you
[1:06:04] gotta deal with it every day
[1:06:07] our friends don't time I had to preach
[1:06:10] an eight-member self to the small I'm
[1:06:12] gonna be war a matter of fact anything
[1:06:14] know what Mark chapter 9 verse 38 now
[1:06:18] look at all these preceding verses that
[1:06:20] lead to the salt Doctrine John answered
[1:06:25] him saying master we saw one casting out
[1:06:29] Devils in thine name and he follow us
[1:06:41] John the beloved John this is the way
[1:06:48] the beloved John was before the beloved
[1:06:50] John got the beloved Holy Ghost we saw
[1:07:01] one casting out Devils in thine name and
[1:07:03] he followeth not us notice John didn't
[1:07:08] say he wasn't following Jesus we said he
[1:07:13] wasn't following us and if he wasn't
[1:07:16] following us bless God we know he
[1:07:19] wouldn't right look at bigotry so
[1:07:29] obstinate about our views our opinion me
[1:07:34] mind
[1:07:40] helps take care of bigotry well praise
[1:07:46] God
[1:07:46] Shaun answer say Master we saw one
[1:07:49] casting out Devils in my name and he
[1:07:52] follow us not us and we forbad him we
[1:07:58] walked right up himself what are you
[1:08:00] doing you're him with us are you give
[1:08:03] you a fellowship card means you guys
[1:08:05] recognize this man who sent this guy
[1:08:07] what me Peter said what me said ender
[1:08:10] one means I'm mark well what in the
[1:08:13] world you actual do anything for the
[1:08:14] kingdom of God but the original salt
[1:08:23] shaker said forbid him not so the chosen
[1:08:31] disciples said one thing and the master
[1:08:33] of the disciple said something totally
[1:08:35] different why he was the salt
[1:08:39] [Applause]
[1:08:41] he was the salt
[1:08:47] forbid him not for there is no man which
[1:08:51] shall do a miracle in my name that can
[1:08:54] lightly speak evil of me boys don't you
[1:09:02] all see you've heard my teaching on
[1:09:04] marriage and divorce you've heard my
[1:09:07] teaching to the Pharisees and the
[1:09:08] Sadducees don't you see you all lack so
[1:09:12] much yourself
[1:09:18] you boys need a good salting now this
[1:09:28] brings two new light I hope the saying
[1:09:32] of being salty what's another thing that
[1:09:40] prohibits peace that's offensive mark
[1:09:45] chapter 9 verse 42 never remember this
[1:09:47] is the same chapter whosoever shall
[1:09:49] offend one of these little ones that
[1:09:51] believe in me it is better for him that
[1:09:54] a millstone were hanged about his neck
[1:09:56] this is a person now intentionally cast
[1:09:59] a stumbling-block
[1:10:00] or does something intentionally in front
[1:10:04] of someone to cause them to err
[1:10:06] oh my be better for him that a millstone
[1:10:09] were hanged about his neck and he were
[1:10:11] cast into the sea good reasons for salt
[1:10:16] can I go on farther I go the quieter
[1:10:20] y'all give what salt hurts noted no it
[1:10:25] hurts now Jesus is going to wind up in
[1:10:31] the ultimate purpose of the salt by
[1:10:36] bringing it down to personal failures in
[1:10:39] the lust of the flesh so from this point
[1:10:45] on nobody bat your eyes say man ouch
[1:10:47] Oh me or anything if you don't want to
[1:10:49] mark chapter 9 verse 45 and if thy foot
[1:10:53] offend they now you can reap several
[1:10:55] verses prior to this but to save time
[1:10:57] notice Jesus bringing the offenses now
[1:11:00] to the body to the flesh so if your eyes
[1:11:04] things you pluck it out if your hand
[1:11:06] offends you cut it off now the knowing
[1:11:08] is not physically speaking of removing
[1:11:11] the hand but he's pointing in a
[1:11:12] direction of the lust of the flesh then
[1:11:16] if there's something that repetitively
[1:11:18] bothers your flesh over
[1:11:20] and over again sever that weakness from
[1:11:24] yourself and listen friend the Holy
[1:11:27] Ghost will not do it if a smartphone
[1:11:30] gets you in trouble gets a dumb phone
[1:11:32] for a dummy if the internet gets you in
[1:11:40] trouble because you browse thro the
[1:11:42] browser and the internet out in the yard

[1:11:50] [Applause]
[1:11:51] all my thoughtful offend thee cut it off
[1:11:55] it is better for thee to enter in halt
[1:11:57] into life than having two feet and be
[1:12:00] cast into hell apparently this is pretty
[1:12:02] serious stuff my end of the fire that
[1:12:06] never shall be quenched or the worm dies
[1:12:08] not and the fire is not quenched if I
[1:12:11] offend thee pluck it out what are we
[1:12:15] talkin about application of salt well
[1:12:23] because of your eyes offending you by
[1:12:26] looking at things you should not look at
[1:12:28] guess what you just forfeited your peace
[1:12:31] with God come on now friends this is get

[1:12:48] website to another false doctrine

[1:12:53] Christ the word come on now what we
[1:12:56] don't believe is the same we don't
[1:12:57] believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:59] that is adultery against the Word of God
[1:13:04] hey then what do we need to do we need
[1:13:09] to ply hand to the Stu the finger that

[1:13:22] to hold a well someone so offended me I
[1:13:25] pop salt to the offense it'll cure it
[1:13:31] then what you have is when you apply the
[1:13:34] soul to the offense the outcome and the
[1:13:38] productivity of that is peace oh I don't

[1:15:41] doing said step y'all know what lye soap
[1:15:45] is it was before Palmolive so when you
[1:15:52] said bad words and you said things you
[1:15:54] shouldn't have said that take you out to
[1:15:56] the wash bucket and then take out lye
[1:15:59] soap and put it in your mouth and wash
[1:16:02] your mouth out with soap now I realize
[1:16:06] that they throwed in jail today for
[1:16:07] child abuse I think they should be
[1:16:09] thrown in jail cause they don't whip up
[1:16:12] but raising a bunch of heathens we're
[1:16:16] raising a bunch of murderers because
[1:16:19] they don't have no discipline at home

[1:16:31] he called his boys sneaking behind the
[1:16:33] barn smoking rap at the back he catch
[1:16:37] his boys saying things they shouldn't

[1:16:42] her tongue out and scrape that tongue
[1:16:45] with that knife and pour what not any
[1:16:48] not molasses there are more colorful
[1:16:58] holders there next time they day they
[1:17:01] were real careful that one day there
[1:17:07] come on Saints we got our conversation
[1:17:11] we've got our thoughts we've got our
[1:17:13] confession so fail with the devil's
[1:17:16] language not a good Christian I'll never
[1:17:18] make it I'll never be in the right role
[1:17:21] you need to get that trash out of your
[1:17:23] mouth your confession needs to be
[1:17:35] [Applause]
[1:17:49] this is the kind of preaching that got
[1:17:51] better gene tarot rated for meeting the
[1:17:53] Lord kind of don't get you're now ready
[1:17:57] to it's on I offend thee pluck it out it
[1:18:03] is better for thee to enter into the
[1:18:04] kingdom of God with one eye nobody know
[1:18:08] they only know one eyed people in heaven
[1:18:10] but Jesus is showing us the value to
[1:18:13] imagine removing one of your eyes he
[1:18:16] said this is how important it is when
[1:18:18] you've got things in you that take away
[1:18:20] your peace or the space between you and
[1:18:23] God a peace between you and your
[1:18:25] brothers or you in your life notice in
[1:18:36] verse 48 where their worm dies not and
[1:18:38] the fire is not quenched and then Jesus
[1:18:42] says verse 49 which is one of the most
[1:18:44] debated verses in the entire Canon of
[1:18:48] Scripture theologians tried to this very
[1:18:51] day to even understand the concept of it
[1:18:54] for every one shall be salted with fire
[1:18:58] and every sacrifice shall be salted with
[1:19:02] salt then he says salt is good so when
[1:19:09] y'all leave church that I said how is
[1:19:11] church salt is good
[1:19:15] his talents at salt is good isn't what
[1:19:18] isn't a word do you mean by that what
[1:19:20] salt is good but if the salt has lost
[1:19:26] his saltness now maybe to this I found
[1:19:30] this in history a little bit to be able
[1:19:33] to show you the salt from the marshes
[1:19:35] and lagoons or from the rocks in the
[1:19:37] neighborhood of the Dead Sea Diesel he
[1:19:39] acquires a stale and alkaline taste
[1:19:43] because of the mixture of the world
[1:19:45] arming jimson it is literally good for
[1:19:54] but to be thrown away and trampled
[1:19:58] underfoot can you imagine the Lord Jesus
[1:20:02] now giving us this command of all the
[1:20:06] great things you say love one another
[1:20:07] and forgive and do this and then Jesus
[1:20:10] comes whether Joe and inserts this
[1:20:13] command have salt in yourselves this is
[1:20:19] not an option our peril endures on your
[1:20:21] car this is a command the same God that
[1:20:25] said love one another and pray for one
[1:20:27] another said have salt you see the salt
[1:20:34] is the power of God it's amazing what
[1:20:40] salt can do salt is so powerful that
[1:20:46] with the energy release out of its
[1:20:50] chemical makeup that you pour just
[1:20:53] unripe amount of salt on a piece of meat
[1:20:56] and me Buffalo whatever was before they
[1:21:00] had freezer packs and all that sort of
[1:21:02] thing how would our fathers our
[1:21:05] ancestors and grandmothers and so on
[1:21:07] keep their meats salt form on Sony and
[1:21:13] they didn't have a ziplock package they
[1:21:15] didn't have that compact but they kept
[1:21:17] them apart salt I was at our Apostolic
[1:21:21] fathers were kept they didn't want they
[1:21:23] were in vacuum rat Christian
[1:21:25] they wasn't cellophane Christians they
[1:21:29] were kept of salt
[1:21:31] they were rugged you ever take a bag of
[1:21:34] all hand meat it's got that salt in it
[1:21:41] you know what song can do a little bit
[1:21:44] of salt on a piece of flesh can actually
[1:21:49] transform that flesh and impart to that
[1:21:53] flash a power that takes on the very
[1:21:58] nature of the salt itself
[1:22:03] [Applause]
[1:22:07] imagine the ham set don't do that don't
[1:22:10] do that I don't like so I don't want
[1:22:11] something you say shut up and you rub it
[1:22:17] all over it and you write a fare and in
[1:22:20] no time the power in that salt has
[1:22:24] changed that flesh to taste like salt
[1:22:33] and the first said I don't want you I
[1:22:35] don't want to on the cell set it's too
[1:22:37] late now buddy I've done been applied to
[1:22:39] your life it's token time I don't want
[1:22:46] to go to church you're going anyhow I
[1:22:48] don't feel like praying I don't wash up
[1:22:52] anyhow some of us might ought to check
[1:22:58] our personal shakers and make sure
[1:23:01] you've got salt in yours and city sugar
[1:23:04] because we like to baby our flesh I'm
[1:23:07] too tired to worship you're pouring
[1:23:09] sugar on your flesh oh I'm too tired I
[1:23:14] don't feel anything brother Donny I
[1:23:17] don't have to feel anything to worship
[1:23:18] brother Donny if I felt it the way you
[1:23:21] do what so you think every time I preach
[1:23:25] I'm just covered over with this feeling
[1:23:28] you think every time I go pray for
[1:23:31] people every time I do funerals every
[1:23:33] time I go visit to say you think I'm
[1:23:35] just walking around with this feeling
[1:23:37] most of the time I'm walking around
[1:23:39] feeling nothing you think I'm feeling
[1:23:45] some from the top of the head to the
[1:23:47] soles of my feet every time I preach to
[1:23:49] you know I am anointed to preach
[1:23:53] I am anointed to worship I am anointed
[1:23:56] the same I am anointed to pray that has
[1:23:59] nothing to do with feeling tell me you
[1:24:03] were waiting on signal you need to wake
[1:24:06] up and realize
[1:24:07] I'm not gonna worship God because of
[1:24:09] feeling this house has purified
[1:24:25] characteristics and traits cleansing
[1:24:29] traits
[1:24:32] it will help purify you from selfish
[1:24:35] sins
[1:24:42] it helps do away it was self because
[1:24:47] salt contains this power of self-denial
[1:24:54] you love it Jesus says where else where
[1:25:00] you season it have salt and yourselves
[1:25:05] and have peace one with another oh it's
[1:25:15] amazing that salt can take this piece of
[1:25:19] meat that come off of the 500 pound
[1:25:22] Yorkshire Hulk and then there's other
[1:25:26] piece of meat come off of the 250 pound
[1:25:30] other count Hulk and then over here's
[1:25:34] another piece of meat that come off of a
[1:25:36] little skinny Hulk and all of them fall
[1:25:40] under the pile of that salt it
[1:25:44] transforms them all keeps them all and
[1:25:47] they all taste suck what's up
[1:25:52] well I don't do this and I don't do that
[1:25:55] yeah then baptize insults interfere you
[1:25:58] need to get your brain baptized and salt
[1:26:00] you need to get your feelings baptized
[1:26:02] and salt you need to get your opinions
[1:26:04] baptized and so then you won't look at
[1:26:06] how big you are how little the person is
[1:26:08] beside you that you look at won fame
[1:26:11] thank God we're all kept the salt this
[1:26:14] is what gives the body peace well praise
[1:26:26] God
[1:26:28] let me see if I can find a place closer
[1:26:30] I've got a hurt Leviticus 2:13 every
[1:26:33] oblation of Don meat offering shelf al
[1:26:40] season result neither shalt thou suffer
[1:26:44] the salt of the covenant of that God to
[1:26:51] be lacking from thy

[1:27:00] [Laughter]
[1:27:06] so here comes a man to bring a meat

[1:32:43] personally just don't think that we need
[1:32:46] that kind of preacher and how many

[1:35:57] Lord to look at an unconverted human
[1:36:00] body can come under the influence of the
[1:36:03] Holy Ghost in so much that it quickens
[1:36:06] our mortal body to the word praise God
