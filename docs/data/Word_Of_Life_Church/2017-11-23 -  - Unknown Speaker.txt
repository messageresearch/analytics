praise the Lord you love the Lord Jesus amen God is certainly good amen thank you for all the music brothers well god bless you it's good to be here back in the house of the Lord I trust that the word was a benefit to you last night I mean something that was said that would be an encouragement to you and and your walk with the Lord knowing that we all face we're all on different levels here this morning all of us facing many different things as the Bible says manifold diverse trials and temptations amen we fight the same devil Amen fight the same spirits there's not any of us to here that are fighting a battle that no one's ever fought all of us fight fight similar things but we all served the same God amen and he's more than enough he's sufficient amen as he told Paul my grace is sufficient Paul you know what that word sufficient means enough that's all you need Paul is my grace is that what your desire is this this morning say God give me more grace amen to fight the battle well amen well have you go to your bible in the book of 1st Samuel chapter 30 will have you turn we spoke last night on understanding your cup of pain in the Lord I actually had us going in a different direction that flipped this on it flipped us on it last night and so we'd like to go that direction and I'm just bound as a servant of God to speak what he burdened to me with amen not what I didn't come here to preach what you want me to preach or want to hear amen and I know you wouldn't want me to do that anyway but you want me to be obedient to the Lord as a servant amen knowing that God has all things in control he moves in mysterious ways amen the Spirit of the Lord is not subject to what man's desires or wants are or what you think or what I think many times friends if we'd be honest we don't even know what we need really amen sometimes we don't even know we think that we do but sometimes we don't even know what we have need of you say well I didn't need to hear that one sometimes you don't realize because we're not sensitive to the spirit all the time but that's exactly what we need so we like to to speak on this this morning I'd like to discontinue from where we left off last night I'd like to speak to you on peace in a time of discouragement peace and a time of discouragement we're gonna read out of the book of Philippians 4 and also first samuel 30 will begin at first samuel 30 it says and it came to pass when david and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day that the Amalekites had invaded the south and Ziklag and smitten Ziklag and burned it with fire and had taken the women captives that were there in they slew not either great or small but carried them away and went on their way so David and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captive what a day of infamy for a brother David could you imagine after coming home from victory and your city that you had homes and your wives and your children and your sons and that's all burned ruined smoke ashes you could ask you could ask the question quite fairly where's the Lord and all of this how could this be the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord my wife's taking captive my sons my daughters you imagine the way that the devil began to torment his mind like a punching bag begin to torment his mind filling with imaginations of haleh's wife was killed and how his sons were had perished and how his daughter's not knowing at this point David has no clue he thinks they're all dead and the Bible says that he came to the city and behold in verse three it was burned with fire their wives and their sons and the daughters were taken captive then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep David's two wives were taken captive verse six David was greatly distressed for the people spoke of stoning him because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but David encouraged himself in the Lord what a powerful Scripture David encouraged himself in the Lord the Bible says in verse seven David said to abbath are the priests I pray thee bring me hither the ephod mammoths are brought forth brought through the ephod to David and David inquired at the Lord saying shall I pursue after this troop shall i overtake them and he answered him for thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all so David went he and six hundred men that were with him and came to the brook basore were those that were left behind stayed but David pursued he and four hundred men for two hundred abode behind which were so faint that they could not go over the brook best sort just came out of battle and I was gonna go right back in and they found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David and gave him bread and he did eat they made him drink water let's move on down to verse 16 and when he had brought him down behold they were spread abroad upon all the earth eating and drinking and danced and this is the Amalekites who have captive their wives and their sons and daughters because of all the great spoil they had taken out of the land of the Philistines and out of the land of Judah and David smote them from the Twilight even unto the evening of the next day and there escaped not a man of them save four hundred young men which rode upon camels and fled and David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away and David rescued his two wives and there was nothing I love how emphatic the scripture is there was nothing lacking to them nothing lacking to them neither small nor great neither sons nor daughters this was the soldiers they had lost all their wives all the army every man that's why they one of the stone David all their wives their sons their daughters are going but the Bible says there was nothing lacking neither sons nor daughters neither spoil nor anything nor anything that they had taken to them David recovered all David took all the flocks and the herds which they drove before those other cattle and said this is David spoil praise the Lord David recovered everything friends it was such a victory that David had over the Amalekites that the Amalekites were not mentioned for 400 years he whipped them but what a victory could you imagine whipping the devil so bad in your life you don't struggle with that ever again in your life it never bothers you in tempo you can have that kind of victory I believe you can have that kind of victory where the devil can doesn't bother you in that area of your life anymore he beat him so bad they're not mentioned 400 years Philippians chapter 4 let's just look at a couple verses there Philippians 4 if you have your Bible if you do have a Bible turn please and now we have the screen for those that don't have it but if you have your Bible turn to Philippians 4 and keep it handy this morning Philippians chapter 4 the Bible says in verse 4 rejoice in the Lord sometimes rejoice in the Lord when money's in the bank rejoice in the Lord when you don't have no health problems you're young with strength no it says rejoice in the Lord and again I say rejoice let your moderation or your gentleness be known unto all men the Lord is at hand or is to say the Lord is near be careful for nothing that word careful means anxious be anxious for nothing be stressed for nothing but in everything but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God and here's the verse we want to put emphasis on this morning and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus many times when you study for a sermon as a minister you study sometimes for weeks sometimes the Lord gives you a thought months before and you begin to look at it and many minister here would know sometimes for days weeks months you look at things you compare notes you compare scriptures you study it thoroughly making sure there's no nuggets in there that God wants you to see but I just preached the Sermon just a couple weeks ago and I probably laid before the for four days till midnight go in my study and just lay there and lay there that's the first time it's ever happened to me every time I went to study I I couldn't even hardly study God would just call me to my knees to pray and I prayed for hours and hours and hours the Lord de smoove din a strange way but I believe he has something for us here this morning amen so forgive me of things maybe it seems a little different this morning I just want to speak to you from the bird and the Lord has placed upon my heart you believe he's mindful amen of you is mindful of that need that you have amen he's the great Shepherd we believe that this morning let's go before him in prayer Heavenly Father Lord as David said I repeat the same words I will look to the hills from whence cometh my help where does my help come from my help cometh from the Lord the Lord who made heaven and earth we look to you Jesus this morning father and you is all Lord as the Bible says the giver of every good gift creator and author of heaven Lord and life and Earth we look to you this morning the unseen father may you come and do the exceedingly abundant father in our midst this morning God the service will be only what each individual makes it Lord what they get what they expect we're taught so clearly Lord we only get what we expect father may they pull upon the gift of God and the anointing of the spirit that's here this morning Lord and may they receive what they have need of Lord it's our simple humble prayer Lord this morning that when we leave this building that our hearts Lord are not more callous to the word it's our prayer this morning that when we leave this building our hearts are not more distant from you they're not more cold on You Father it's our prayer Lord that our hearts and our lives are not back slit and further away from your grace Lord but it's our prayer this morning that when we leave this building that we'll be closer to Jesus that will be more fervent for his word that we'll be more on fire for the things of God it's our prayer this more that you draw us closer to you and that we grow in grace and a knowledge and truth in your word father may you be with us both speaker and here we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated David as we read the story and for any of you who Bible readers who may be read this story recently Aaron did a Bible study on it you find that this is David in a dispensation if we call it that in his life and I've preached so many sermons on David III my middle name is David maybe it's because of that but I've preached so many times that is I love I think it's a powerful thing that God said he's a man after God's own heart and his life was written and described in such detail whereas other men's life you don't have that 3d picture but you do of David and you see the struggles that he went through you get to see his ups and his downs and as his humanity and his asam's you even read the transparency that David has is just amazing to me and always fill it we can learn so many things and glean so many things from brother David David's life as he comes to this place he's not when he comes to Ziklag it's a time in his life where Ziklag if you've looked at this city it's a Philistine City and David takes it from a king that he makes a pact with and David has slayed Goliath that's all in the past he's slayed the Lions and those who were great victories in his life and he had slayed the bear and those were great things and moments of great glory that David had but that's all in the past now and and the boy that everyone was praising and his soldiers had fought foreign and called him the giant slayer that was yesterday and now for today for David he's been on the run from Saul he's been on the run from another king who he's been anointed but yet this King is still on the throne and this is a king who's very jealous of him but David happens to be best friends with this and David has consulted with Jonathan and said why must I suffer at the hands of your father why does he seek to take my life and you find many Psalms where David if you if you compare it with the timeline of his life David is speaking of this struggle that he's having from this pressure that he's feeling I've preached it here before and I'll just repeat it again that you can almost have two versions of David you take version 1 of David is that David who has pressure in his life and he's stressed and if you can just take and spend a moment in this man's shoes he's he's constantly under pressure and he's constantly under anxiety knees constantly feeling you know that just that urged where he can never seemingly he can never just let off the pressure he could he doesn't have that fishin hole he could go to and just you know spend time it doesn't have that tree stand he could go to and just let off the pressure but this is a man who's under constant turmoil and constant struggle yet this man has been anointed by the Prophet he's been told that he would be king over Judah over Israel he has been revealed to him the plan of God for his life and the ultimate end of David's life is a crown where he would rule with the crown over Israel God has told him his plan for his life but yet the problem is is that the reality of his life and the promise and the plan God has given him doesn't line up and so many times in our life God keeps us from the plan that he has for us because he knows the reality of our life doesn't always match the promise that he's given us you take sister Sarah and brother Abraham the promise God had given them they could believe it they could accept it they could say a man to the word but the struggle came when they looked in the mirror because the mirror didn't reveal the promise the mirror everything they looked at in everything they felt said I'm old how can this be possible and so many times the struggle and her mom as we've been given the promises of God and we've been told the plan of God for our life but when we look in the mirror the plan and the promise and the reality are conflicting and this was the struggle for David as he knew the plan of God yet here he is under pressure as we said version one of brother David is that David who has trouble and struggle in his life he has trouble on every side he's being hunted down by Saul and he's under stress and he's living out in the woods and he's living in caves and he's running for his life and he wakes up in the middle of the night at every sound he's waking him and ever every time he hears something he he wonders he's having to look over his shoulder if that saul and and you know in any and he's constantly under pressure constantly under stress he's not had a bath in two weeks because he's been living in the woods swatting mosquitoes and fleeing off snakes and and you take that version of brother David and you say boy that sounds like a rough life now let me give you version two of the same man he's got a castle he has $10,000 in his check and his savings account will make it bigger $100,000 in his savings account he's a millionaire a billionaire he has a casualty as the greatest car he has the biggest house he has no trouble he has to worry he has no stress he has no pain he doesn't worry about anything and our human tendency is to go uh I'll take that David I'd rather be that David with no struggle or no pain or no pressure but let me tell you what Bible history teaches us there was never a more carnal corrupt backslidden David than the David without pressure David without struggle there was never a more carnal backslidden tempted mantha than there was when David had no struggle and there was never mores fervent more on fire david than the david who was running for his life and who had pressure and who had stress and who had worried and who had pain and had trials and tribulations but my brother he were had a fervency with god that's why the bible says they could not strange when fiery trials are to try you knowing that the trial of your faith worketh patience as job is we preached on last night it was the struggle and the torment and the pain that calls job to come to a resolve to where he could say though I can't feel God or see God yet he sees me and he knows me and he knows my name old brother sometimes you have to say is the song that they sang I may not know what tomorrow holds but I know who holds my tomorrow I may not have all the answers to the questions of life but I know in whom I have believed and he knows my name David is he comes to this city and Ziklag and you don't have to turn but and you can pull it up some I'm first samuel 27 david said in this heart I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul there is nothing better for me than I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines and Saul shall despair of me to seek me anymore in my in any coast of Israel so shall I escape out of his hand David arose and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him under a Koosh the son of Mohawk king of Gath and David dwelt with a Koosh Gath he and his men now what we do not find in verse 1 of 1st Samuel 27 we do not find it saying that God spoke to David and said you shall now one day perish at the hand of Saul there's nothing better for you brother David then you should escape to the Philistines is that what the Bible says no it's not it we don't read we don't find the text that says God moved upon the heart of David and told him David you know I know I've promised you the crown but you know the pressure is really hot and you may get killed you might just better go settle in sick lag instead till things calm down the Bible doesn't say that does it pull that back up first samuel 27 David said and David said first samuel 27 verse 1 brothers if you have it and david said in his heart David said not God said David said in his heart so many times we attribute the will of God and it's actually just the will of man as I've said jokingly before you hear the statement I feel led so much it almost sickens you sometimes I feel lead sometimes the leadership of God is really just the leadership of man that we call the leadership of God you look at people's decisions and you wonder did you eat lead or did you feel led you could laugh it's just a joke David said in his heart David said I shall now perish one day by the hand of soul sir is nothing better David did you consult God brother David did you ask God did you inquire of God that I should have speedily escaped in the land of the Philistines Saul shall despair in other words soul just forget about me you know I know it's not I know God has promised me this God has promised me the king but the kingdom but here's the reality souls running after me I'm tired of the pressure I'm just gonna go settle in sick lag I just won't peace I just want to come I just I just want to relieve the pressure oh I know what I'll do hours the Bible says you've hung out with your own hands you've carved out with your own fingers God didn't build this don't attribute it to God this is something you did David and you know good and well it's on it's nothing more than a cop-out because you're tired of the pressure you're tired of the trouble you're tired of the struggle and so David settles for false worldly peace as many people have settled because of the trouble and struggle and the stress and the pressure so many times people check out of the fight with with the devil sometimes we get off the firing line because we're tired of the stress tired of the struggle tired of the pressure tired of the questions tired of the fears and so David says I shall now perish I know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna contrive a plan and I'm gonna go to the Felicity and Ankush and notice what David does and it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath and he saw no more again for him you say well see there David made a good decision and it worked keep reading David said unto a Koosh if I've now found grace verse 5 in thy eyes let them give me a place in some town in the country that I may dwell there for why should I serve and dwell in the Royal City with thee and a Koosh gave him sick lag that day wherefore Ziklag pertain earth unto the kings of judah unto this day at that time and the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months and so David because of the pressure because of the trouble rather than continuing in the struggle David checks out of the struggle to settle and by temporary false peace and my brother and my sister so many people have settled for false peace because if they be honest they've they're tired of the struggle they're tired of the stress I know it's not of God and I know it's you know I got to repent for it but you know I just need oh I just need a break brother Matt you don't understand I just need a I need a reprieve from all my troubles I I know I'm not consulted god no I'm not asked God no I'm not inquired of God but I just need a break can I can you kind of get some slack here can you cut me some slack God just give me a break I'm I'm tired of the pressure I'm just gonna settle in six like sick legs fine it's a good City I could have my children there I can plant vineyards we could build a home and everything will be fine and Ziklag old but david don't you realize you're cutting yourself short God wants to give you the kingdom and you're settling for Ziklag God wants to give you the crown but you're settling for Ziklag oh why are you settling but the crown means struggle means stress it means trouble oh but the great will be the glory of fuel endure for a season always the Bible says the temporary light affliction of this present time shall not begin to compare with the glories that God has waiting for those who endure to the end oh my brother it is not revealed who's the son and daughter of God and he who starts the race because many start but the ultimate revealing isn't he who finishes the race and David has dwelled as many others have settled as it clag and they've built a house in sick leg they still love godless and I'm not saying David didn't love the Lord he didn't go and serve a bear he didn't go and serve a God of bail he didn't start worshipping and letting his children worship you know he David do not backslide into the world David just decided I'm still gonna serve God I still believe in Jehovah but I'm gonna dwell in sickling and many people have checked out because of stress and they've checked out from reality to fantasy you say all but I'm here this morning brother Matt and I'm here but are you really here I want to challenge you this morning you say well I'm here Anna are you really here are you really here is your heart and your purpose is right or are you just fulfilling the religious duty and pressure of their conscience telling you you should come to church on Sunday morning are you really here this morning Oh as you take a company you have employees who are there for one reason check in and check out now there to collect a paycheck they don't want to deal with any of the problems then you have people who believe that company they believe in the inspiration behind it and God is not looking for soldiers who want to check in and check out on Sunday and Wednesday God is looking for an army who says I get behind my King David and I want to fight in their front lines for my field Oh can you say Amen this morning I want to be a soldier brave and true keep on the firing line and David's like many others have settled for false peace David as we said this word and if you just turn quickly here to John chapter 14 if they didn't want to pull it up on the screen Jesus says in verse 26 he says but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost John chapter 14 whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I said I have said unto you know here's verse 27 I want to key in on John 14 verse 27 Jesus gives these words and he says notice this peace I leave with you now this is John 14 this is in the midst of Jesus's Gethsemane this is in the midst of the trouble and the midst of the pain and the struggle and Jesus is going to say I'm struggling right now but here's my message to you peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you so the peace of God is a gift from God let me say it clear it is your right to have the peace of God in your life it is the inalienable believer to have the peace of God oh that makes me happy I want to say hallelujah this morning it is the right of the believer to have the peace of God God is not the author of chaos God is not the author of confusion my peace I leave are given to you not notice don't be mean don't misunderstand not as the world giveth give I unto you I'm not giving you the kind of worldly piece you see worldly piece is very different than biblical piece worldly piece is very different than godly piece Jesus says this is the piece I give unto you my peace I leave with you not as the world gives but this piece that I give is very different it's more than just a cliche it's more than just a song that you've seen it's more than just something you learn about in Sunday school Jesus is telling you I'm gonna give you a gift then you'll have throughout trouble and tribulation and trial and struggle my peace I give unto you you see the worldly pieces Jesus says what is pieces we ask that question what is peace then the world defines peace in these words and you can give synonyms peace is the sense of calm and tranquility quietness peace is bliss and contentment and well-being that you feel when you believe everything is well I'm describing to you the peace that the world gives it is bliss and tranquility it's the feeling of just relaxed that everything's okay and when does this peace come when you have no trouble and no trial and you have no problems and no issues there's just a sense of I'm just at peace everything's peaceful this is the way that the Webster's defines it it's a sense of peace is the sense of tranquility the attitude of a settled quiet that comes when you believe everything is ok and everything is the way that you like it that's nice I said and that sounds so pretty oh can we just read that again such bliss and peace tranquility no trouble everything's fine no struggle and let me say this friend this is the peace that people have settled for but it's a false peace let me say this it's a very shallow piece calm feelings quietness tranquility can be produced by appeal calmness and quietness and tranquility and calm can be produced once you get an inheritance of $50,000 suddenly there's a peace and a calm but let me say this any manufactured or manipulated piece is fragile and can be broken at a moment's trouble that's the peace that the world gives and let me say brother many people have settled for this peace they've settled for alcohol because it gives them a calm or a relaxation or a relief from the struggle and the trouble oh my brother or my sister if that's a trap and a snare for you let me tell you it's a fragile peace it'll never hold you or keep you but there is an alcohol there is a stimulation of the Spirit of God that you can drink of that never passes away they've settled for nicotine or drugs or some some pill that they could take oh we don't have a lot of drug addicts that smokey legal drugs are taking legal drugs but we got a lot of what we call religious pills we have more people addicted to prescription drugs than they are so illegal drugs off the street Christians believers for the matter you hammering against me I'm not brother I'm here to tell you sister God can set you free of that you're settling for a false peace you're settling for a false hope and it can shatter you in the moments notice when you don't have it you're shaking and you Bri you can't breathe and you've got to have it and it's an addiction that get the devil and the snare and a trap that the devil has trapped many people false peace peace of feeling you say what's wrong with filling of calm there's nothing wrong with that and all those things God gives you all those things God does give you and their attributes of peace but let me say this that kind of piece can be produced by a lie some people are living a lie of peace they can be produced by a deception they can be produced by a nap you take a nap you feel peace you go to Disney World you say brother man is there anything wrong no not necessarily anything wrong with those things I do many things in my life and have many pastimes that I enjoy to try to just get a reprieve from the world and the rat race and the struggle but let me say this my brother with every temptation with every struggle Satan will always give you the route out Satan will always give you with every tear every struggle that you go through and the pressure Satan will always give you a plan for exit settle for false peace and false hope money can be a false peace we realize the world thinks that all we need is to fix the debt and now we'll have peace friend that won't be no peace that doesn't produce peace the world's at calm look how fast how quickly China cheapens there they conned their money and boom just like that the stock market crashes and people are starting to talk about the depression or the the economic crisis of 2008 happened and again in September just when everyone started to breathe easy thinks are getting better finally things are getting better and then suddenly overnight just like that it's gone how quickly peace can leave we have the turn to be at peace to have peace with God but you also hear the term in the cliche many times use to be at peace with God we say it when a loved ones passing was they at peace with God are you at peace with God what does it mean to be at peace with God what does it mean when you can say there's nothing between my soul and my Savior oh my brother and my sister many people run from this question they run in their entire life that's why there's multi-million dollar industries who make millions of dollars a year on facial creams and skin creams and vitamins and pills trying so hard to push off death we try so hard to get away from that question we push it off and I watch so many people live their entire life seeking the best doctors to try to keep him alive you take the best millionaires even the man Steve Jobs who created Apple had the most money had more money than than they could buy the best doctor the best drugs the best procedures and it still didn't save him and all of his money he still went to a grave but people try to push off the question you say brother man is that ok do we do should we dwell on death and I'm not I'm not saying you should dwell on death or be morbid but listen friend you should have a healthy respect that your life is just a vapor and it could be gone tomorrow or tonight or in this service you have no idea what could happen you don't have no promise of tomorrow and I asked you the question it may seem simple but let me let up a preacher a simple preacher asked you are you at peace with God do you know Jesus oh Jesus is love but I say Jesus is peace it's the very characteristic of peace do you know him this morning in the power of his resurrection or have you pushed off that question so far out of your mind none of us wants to die listen friends some people are they they live their entire life and they die a scared person not knowing where they're gonna go when they take their last breath afraid of death afraid of the end what does the end mean even Christians can be I'm not saying that I mean it's natural all of us want to live death it's not part of God's plan it was the fall that brought forth death none of us want to die none of us you could be righteous as you want to be all right you know that he hates the day listen from there ain't one of you that wants to die this morning all of us love life we love life we love health and that's okay but it's an attribute of God but you should have a respect and a realization that your life is fleeting every single day your health is wasting away every day your but you get older every second you're fading you better answer the question why you still can do you know peace I'm not asking you if you know a Sunday School lesson are you u.s. had a mental agreement or a sent with a story about Jesus Oh my brother and my sister I'm asking you this morning ask yourself the question do you know him do you really know him oh you you you may not say a man and it may not be loud in here I don't mind at all I want to ask the question do you really know him do you really know him as your Savior have you really been buried with him in Baptism have you been regenerated into life have you died to your passion and your pride and been born again by the Spirit of God there's death a question that scares you Solomon writes and since I think it's a Ecclesiastes 3 Solomon says to everything there's a season to everything a time to give birth a time to be born a time to die a time to plan a time to pluck up that which is planted God appoints your birthday and he appoints your funeral if you are going to have a funeral it's all brother Matt we're all gonna go in a rapture yes we believe by faith but every generation before us believed they would go on a rapture and I believe there will be those who don't taste death and I believe I'm part of that number but I want to have a healthy respect to say if my life is gone and tomorrow is my in and is it clear between my soul and my Savior do I have that peace that passes understanding do I look at doors just a doorway that leads to another dimension the trouble so many times is that we fell number our days do you know David even prayed that David said then one of my favorite Psalms and and it's in Psalms chapter 90 David says Lord teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom what is David meaning friend this one verse was one of the most powerful experiences I've ever had in God many many different times the Lord has came to me and spoke to me in powerful ways and services through tongues and prayer but never ever has it been this this magnificent if I could use that word of a time when I was laying it in in a in an in a basement in a preaching some meetings and in the middle of the night God woke me up out of nowhere three o'clock in the morning and inspired a verse I'd never even read begin to read my Bible and God began to bring before me the faces of my children and my wife and my family and my brother let me tell you I cried for hours until that morning I cried out to God because I realized that life is fading and flowers around you are quickly growing and fading what are you doing with your time are you spending your time and effortless and valueless pointless things or have you realized that the things that are most important and most valuable in life are quickly fading away and I prayed on my knees in that basement and said God teach me to number my days teach me that I may apply my heart unto wisdom let me live every day and make every day count some of us fathers and mothers and children and different ones I don't care who you are what level of life you are stop and slow down for just a moment Satan wants to put you on the rat race and the busyness of life and make you forget and you get 15 years down the road and you look back and say where did time go what a time go your children are only young once be a father to them when they need a father your sons and your daughters are only young once make sure you live and breathe every moment and make sure there's a testimony that they see a man of God and a woman of God who will stand with them and pray with them and plead with them not a dad who's always going and busy at work trying to pay trying to build the next new house or the next nicest thing not a mom who's so busy and caught up in Social Affairs that she misses the life of her children God told me to preach this and I'm gonna preach it David says teach us to number our days that we may gain a heart of wisdom heard it said that that a man who let me just find my place here a wise man once said the full spins his time but the wise and prudent invests his time the full spends his time but the wise and prudent invests his time it says also in Psalms 90 the days of our years are threescore years and ten if by reason of strength they may be fourscore years yet as their strength labor and sorrow for it is soon cut off and we fly away soon cut off how many people's lives have came to a premature in suddenly let me ask you something if God was to reveal to you that next week that your end and maybe your life is going to end friend we don't want to you we don't want to be morbid this morning but let's face reality here you don't have the promise of tonight or tomorrow David even asks that question and another place and ecclesia Aaron I'll read this first Ecclesiastes 7 - says it's better to go to the house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting for death is the destiny of everyone the living should take this to heart david says in Psalms 39 he asks a very honest question of the Lord show me Lord my life's end and the number of my days let me know how fleeting my life is could you be honest enough to ask that question this morning could we be honest enough to say as David said Lord show me the end of my day show me my life's in and the number of my days you say why would David even want to know this because David knows that that there's a spirit of rush and move and push and David says Lord I want to live and make sure how I make sure that I'm living every moment of my life and are not pushing to tomorrow and chasing dreams of tomorrow when I'm missing what's happening all around me David was a man who didn't want to live with regrets in his life as he looked back on years down the road had become an old man he wanted to look back on his life and know that he applied his heart unto wisdom that he made every day count that he wasn't spending wasted time and time and wasted things o friends I'm not saying that there's there's there that we that we that we don't do anything hobbies' or anything for recreation but my brother and my sister are you spending your time on what's really important think about it just for a moment how are we spending every day of our life are we spending it with the people that we love who God's placed in our life or are we neglecting our children oh I pay the bills I go to work I'm home aina James says life is a vapor life is just a vapor it's here today it's going tomorrow many people run from this question as we said many people push this question off because they have no peace with God they don't know him in the power of his resurrection and they live in every single day trying to push that question away from their mind you think and you're under the deception that Judas keep living and living and getting stronger and stronger but my brother my sister let me wake you up this morning is it this life is nothing more than a life full of troubles and sorrows they wait for tomorrow the only peace that you can find us in Jesus the only portion that you could find of joy it's not in this world and it's vain riches and it's vain saw recreation and entertainment all those things are a false deception they're a false hope and a false peace but Jesus in Jesus there's peace in Christ there's Thanksgiving in peace the only real peace that we'll have in this world is not when we get a the next president or some Republican or Democrat or or something listen friend all those things are just a system waiting to fail the only piece will be the peace when God sets up his kingdom and I say Lord hasten the day it's the only piece and reprieve for the believer oh the kind of worldly peace people have settled for you can get it for you good as we said it can be produced by drugs or alcohol calm peace tranquility and well-being produced when you maybe you get an inheritance of some money and then you get a sense of peace I guess what it can all fade just like that that's not the kind of peace Paul has in mind when Paul says I pray the God of peace grant you peace every day listen friend the peace that I'm speaking of is not the peace that can be induced or fabricated by money or by drugs the peace that Jesus said I leave with you is a piece that's not just about how things are going good but Jesus says my peace is a supernatural anointing that every believer has a right to that when you're in the middle of the belly of the there can be a peace that passes understanding oh when you're in the middle of the fiery furnace and the fires been turned up seven times more hotter there's a fourth man in the middle of your fire who will be with you oh the kind of peace that were preaching about is the kind of peace that P that Stephen had when the Bible says he was being stoned and the Bible says that his rocks were being slung upon him peace Stephen has such a peace he says Lord forgive them and receive my spirit you see this is the kind of godly peace that God gives it's a peace that the Bible says in Philippians transcends your human understanding you say what does that mean brother Matt what is the peace God gives the peace God gives is a supernatural peace that you can say though he slay me yet I'll trust him the Lord God giveth and the Lord God taketh away it is the peace that the three Hebrew boys had when they said listen our God is more than able to deliver us from this fiery furnace our God whom we serve what was it nikka Nebuchadnezzar in the face of threatening and intimidation they had a calm since about him that they knew my God is more than able he's more than able to deliver me from the fiery furnace it was a peace of God that I'm speaking up to you this morning what was it it was a supernatural anointing that anointed these men that in the face of danger and in the face of trouble and the face of trial they could still have a sense of calm about them they could say our God whom we serve is more than able to deliver us out of the fiery furnace is that your testimony today just say the God whom I serve I'm not looking at the circumstance I'm not looking at the fiery furnace I'm looking at a promise in God's Word and the God whom I serve is more than able to deliver me oh but a drug could have produced that kind of faith let's go further they said even if our God does not deliver us is that what they said they said listen Nebuchadnezzar make it known unto you that even if we perish in that fire we still won't bow hallelujah Oh glory to God they said even if we perish in the midst of a fiery furnace we still won't bow what was it they had a piece the past human understanding it was the same piece that Jesus had when it came before Pilate and Pilate said there was such a calm about him he said don't you know I have the power to give you life or to give you death and Jesus said because he had a piece down inside of his soul jesus said you have no power over me but what my father in heaven gives you this angered Pilate because he never spoke a word the Bible says he either not a word what was it he possessed the peace that passes understanding our friend is that the kind of peace that you won't this morning I said is that the kind of piece that you want this morning to say God don't give me a piece of the world that can fade and crumble and shatter at a moment's notice give me the peace that when I'm in the middle of the fiery furnace when I'm going through and struggling I can't understand what's happening yet I'll still praise you yet I'll still worship you oh you could serve God and you can worship God when the goings good but can you today this morning raised the hand to God and say I'll serve you and I'll praise you no matter what I'm going through oh my brother the kind of peace were preaching on this morning is the piece that says Paul and Silas had in the prison the Bible says that when they were arrested notice arrested for delivering a young woman of a spirit and now they're arrested bond bound in fetters and chains could you imagine these men after you imagine after preaching a sermon today what would you think of me after after I preached this sermon today you walked out in the parking lot and there were sheriff's deputies they stripped me naked of my clothes and beat me and fought me arrested me and took me to prison some of you'd say hmm not sure about that guy he must have been a secret sinner must have had sin in his life somewhere hello somebody this was the story of brother Paul and brother Silas right coming out of a deliverance service they're arrested deep fog strip naked put in a prison if anybody would have had an excuse to be depressed if anybody would have had an excuse to be downtrodden and downcast his brother Jules says wowsie wowsie whoo if anybody had a reason to come to church and fold their arms and sit there and not worship and not say Amen it was brother Paul and brother Silas but my Bible tells me that in the midst of the prison they began to sing songs and praise to God in the midst of their chains in the midst of their blood and torment and beating had begun to sing my god ray hi God rains could you imagine the other prisoners do you hear that hey hey John weren't these the guys that were just beat out there and the crowd was screaming the soldiers what are they singing our God is an awesome God he reigns from heaven above with we some power and love our God is an awesome God did you hear don t hear that song coming from over there I think I hear it is that those same boys as Paul began to sing and a silent big silence begin to worship he's in the house death has to flee now there is life where darkness used to be you mean the same men that were just flogged and beaten stripped naked or singing and worshipping and suddenly the Bible says that the prison begins to shake and the earth begin to shake what was it they had a piece that passed understanding it was an anointing that came upon their soul and in the middle of their hell they began to worship they begin to sing I bless your name I bless your name the Bible says that the earth begin to tremble and the prison begin to shake and you imagine these men as the soldiers watch these two men in the middle of their trial in the middle of their desperation oh my friend can you worship Him this morning in the middle of your hell in the middle of the dungeon of your life can you raise your hands this morning and say god I worship you in the of my dungeon in the middle of my hell and the belly of the well oh you ought to worship him more than that this morning friend you are to give him the praise that's to his name to say God no matter how I feel no matter what the situation looks like you're worthy of my praise the Bible says that as they begin to sing their chains fell off as they begin to worship in the middle of their hell the prison cells begin to break open and guess what they went free they went free but guess what Paul and Silas wasn't the only ones who went free that day the Bible says every prisoner that was bound went free I guess you didn't hear me I said every prisoner that was found went free every person that was found went free oh don't you realize when you can get victory and praising when you don't feel like praising him and when you feel cold and stagnant and stale but you begin to raise your hands for God and give him a wave offering and say Lord no matter the circumstance no matter the trial our worship you the Bible says every person who is bound when free oh that we can have that kind of a deterred service this morning every person bound by nicotine went free every person down by alcohol with free every person bound by pornography went free every person bound at freedom that day I'll give him a praise offering this morning friends worried to Jesus it was a piece that passed understanding you see this is the piece that Jesus says I leave with you my peace I give you not as the world gives my peace Lord I want your peace I want your peace when I'm in the belly of a well and it doesn't make sense and I can't make sense of what's happening I want to praise you even then Lord when I have to go into a fiery furnace and it seems like death is near Lord I want to praise you even then because I know that in the midst it wasn't until they begin to praise him oh don't miss it it was not until they worshiped him in the middle of their pain that the fourth man appeared it wasn't til they began to praise him in the midst of their change that the earth began to shake peace that passes understanding this is where David finds himself in 1st Samuel 30 we see such a hard time for brother David as we get back to our text this morning as we read David comes to Ziklag and first Samuel 30 if you have your Bible just turn there with me we'll read it one more time he comes to this city and no doubt he's coming from victory David is not expecting what's about to happen he had he thinks everything's going to be fine when he comes home he's been anointed king he settled in Ziklag but the Bible tells us that when his men were come to Ziklag on the third day the Amalekites had invaded the south in Ziklag and smitten Ziklag and burned it with fire and had taken the women captive that were there in they slew not any either great or small but carried them away and went on their way what a shock that brother David had when he comes home now sick lag as we said as history teaches us sir the Bible tells us that the history of it that he comes and he settles for this city sick lang and now David didn't realize but sick lag is going to cost you david Ziklag is gonna cost you your wife your family your sons your daughters oh but it was just reprieve it was just relief I was just doing it to catch a break but it's gonna cost it's gonna cost you David I remember the story of Jacob said Jacob when he goes to Shechem and David loses his daughter - she sees violated and took by one of the one of the men of Shechem the Jacob had no clue that as he win instead of going back and worshiping God David guard Jacob goes and now it cost him his own daughter do you realise sometimes the choices that we make what they cost us David comes to Ziklag and he pulls up and he sees as they come from 50-mile journey three days and men are tired from weary from war want to come home to maybe a nice hot meal see their wife their children come run and embrace in their arms here they're fighting for this man David David thinks he's in the will of God until he presses clearly comes upon the crest of that last hill and they looked at him and smokes billowing from Ziklag imagine the distraught filling in the depression that suddenly settles in is they begin to look and the men begin to run through the city looking calling for their children call him for their wife nobody's home everybody's gone there's not even a there's not even they took all the sheep all the ox and all the goats they took though the women the children everything David comes to an end of himself as we read last night in Psalms 38 David begins to say this prayer is this struggle he had within him David begins to become discouraged I could imagine he was discouraged as the easy thinks everything was just going to script everything was going as planned but now his wife has captured as children are gone David begins to become greatly distressed and troubled and the Bible says that the men begin to speak of stoning him could you imagine here these same men that were fighting with him that were standing by a side just a few days ago in battle now David hears the murmuring it's all his fault have we not listened to Hillman went over we wouldn't be in this mess now look you imagine the my battles that these men were having they begin to wonder about their kids and their family for all they know they're dead you'd want to blame somebody David can ask the question is this how the righteous are rewarded Lord what have I done what have I done now my wife and children and home and family burned and gone and now even my own men my own friends no one's there to come for him no one's there to encourage him no one's there to pray for him or to say it's okay David oh and David's remembering no doubt Samuel anoint him as King and Samuel pour in the anointing oil upon his head and now it doesn't make sense he sees the promise he remembers the promise but he looks at life and reality and there's a problem there because the promise and the reality are not lining up at all he knew he was called specially chosen to take the throne he knew the crown would eventually be his David had a visitation from God he spoke with God he pleaded with God he would sell us for God and now that can come over as he stands there upon this burning ruin of his life and David's looking at all his mess not knowing if his family was dead or alive the torment of his mind he's thinking act after everything that he's went through in all the struggles in trouble we went through after finally finding a home after finally having some peace for a year and four months he didn't know though David it was false peace you think you've gotten peace because you've neglected the Word of God or neglected the plan of God took a job that you knew you weren't supposed to take took you out of church took your family out of church took you away from your home church but you got money oh but I got money no trouble oh brother it's false peace finally he gets some reprieve finally he gets some peace finally things are settled and calm it's all gonna be okay but don't you realize David to hold sick leg you're gonna have to fight with your hands you're gonna have to fight and keep everything you got you're gonna have to do it all yourself when God wants to give you a kingdom that cannot be shaken God wants to give you a kingdom to where he'll fight your battles but you've settled and tuned out of your own hands the city are you with me here this morning and all this false peace begins to settle in upon David and he realized now us here can read the Bible and we have the privilege of reading the end of the story and we could say this morning even though David didn't know it God was right in the smack dab middle of this tragedy God was right in the thick of it God was trying to teach David a lesson God was trying to bring David to something my brother David had no idea brother do you realize sometimes when you think God's forsaken you and God's forgotten about you and you can't see God in any of it God is right in the middle of it he's right in the middle of that night of lonely pleading prayer and fake all's been lost and Oscar gone but just remember joy comes in the morning David had no clue that God was in control of everything and my brother my sister that's exactly what the peace of God gives you it gives you a peace to know God has it all in control I may not understand it but I believe God has the situation in control because he is peace he is the author of peace let me tell you my brother he is the author of peace he is peace himself peace is not an attribute of God peace is God oh can I preach to you just here for a moment I said peace is God it's not just an attribute of God peace is God he is peace there is no lack of perfect peace in the beam of God at all times God has perfect peace he has never troubled by anything he never struggles with anxiety and pressure over anything let me tell you God never worries for one second he never doubts God never fears he's never in discord with his own self or his own will he's omniscient he's all-knowing Satan is not a mission and all-knowing don't you forget that Satan cannot be everyplace everywhere all the time but my God whom I serve can be everyplace everywhere every time in my life he's never in a cross with himself God has never unclear about what he wants he's never unsure about what he thinks God has never threatened in God is a perfect calm in God His perfect tranquility in God His perfect control why because God knows he's in charge of everything and everything that happens he's operating everything both good and both bad everything is according to his own will or exactly Holly wants it at all times there's nothing ever in the entire universe that catches God off guard oh can I preach about God here just for a moment there's nothing ever out of keiter he's never surprised by anything there are never no sense of unknown or unaware to God he never changes he never doubts he never fears his wrath even his wrath is perfectly controlled he's not an angry God who just gets angry and slapped somebody his wrath is even perfectly controlled and orchestrated he is perfect in every way and let me tell you that same God made a promise the piece that I have living inside of me I give it to you I said the peace that passes understanding I give it to you in every situation you can have a perfect calm and peace from Jesus let me tell you there's no sinner that can stand before him that His grace can't save I don't care how much in sin or bounds your loved one is or your friend or your family I don't care how bound it seems there is no sinner that can stand before the grace of Jesus but God can't save there's no possible sin that can sustain his holiness he is perfect in every way there's no guilt in his mind there's no shame in his mind there's no condemnation in his spirit he is perfect in peace there's no regret in his mind or his person he's never said anything that he didn't mean he's never done anything that he has to take back and this same person by the Spirit of God is living inside of you my brother and my sister that same God who's perfect in every way oh can you rejoice with me this morning that same God who's perfect and lives inside of his family he enjoys perfect harmony with himself he is peace that's why the Bible calls him the Lord of peace I want that Lord of peace to rule over I said I want that peace of God to rule over my life I want that peace just to cover me and enshroud my family oh I want you to take that situation in your home or your marriage or your family or your church raise your hand and say peace of God would you cover me this morning peace of God only whom there's no variableness or a shadow of turning would you cover me may the God of peace and I'll comfort David comes and the Bible says as we read it the Bible says he comes to this moment little does David know God's right in the thick of it and David hears the murmurs and the complaining imagine as he's watching what do I do if there was ever a man who should have folded and crumbled under pressure could you imagine if you were responsible you were responsible for all these soldiers who fall for you and now you're the one to blame for their deaths and their families and their wives and their children imagine the guilt his David begins to hear the whispers wish its toning that begin to blame him begin to blame him for everything that's happened I can't imagine David 600 men bows swords scattered on the earth shields lay him down takes a lot to make a man cry but let him lose his family it'll break that man to his inner core soldiers men who were callused from battle now those same strong warriors weeping the Bible says they cried and wept until they had no more tears to cry and here's David in the second middle of it as they cried and cried and cried I can see soldiers on their knees at their homes picking up maybe tarnished pieces and memory something burnt of one of the homes and they've seen something of a one of their possessions of their wife or their children you can imagine as their their hearts begin to crack and bleed they begin to be under such torment and now David himself all of the attention focuses on David and now everything is coming back to his mind and I can guarantee you the question he's asking is why Ziklag why did I do why didn't I just stay on the front line why didn't I just stay the pressure was hard but this is much harder to bear imagine the guilt of his own decision when he came but I can see brother David as the men are weeping and wailing and sort crying and everyone's crying and pleading out to God cursing and blaming David it's all your fault David my wife is gone it's all your fault listen my brother this was not there was nowhere that David could find encouragement there was nobody who was gonna give him a hug you know an encouraging word there was no child to hold his hand there was no Jonathan to encourage him he was all by himself but I could see David all by himself sitting over there tears streaming down his face but then suddenly David something deep we don't only inside the prophet of God said hey not my baby Lord if you take my baby I won't even serve you he said it's something down on the inside of me grabbed ahold of me and he said something I didn't even know was there he said grabbed a hold of me and held me I imagine that something from David has he's crying and weeping I can imagine David sits there in the dust and dirt as his tears begin to stream from his face and David can't find encouragement from any brother he can't find encouragement from any sister he can't find encouragement from his pastor he can't find encouragement from a brother he can't find encouragement in anybody but the Bible says he encouraged himself in the Lord he began to encourage himself in God oh brother don't you realize sometimes God doesn't want you to draw from the well of your brother or your sister or your pastor or a preacher but God wants you to come to the revelation there's a well down on the inside of you there's our living water a river of life down on the inside of you all you've got to do is draw from the well that God's put inside of you David begins to cry but David's voice under his voice I can hear him begin to mumble in my distress I cry unto the Lord I cried to my god for help and he heard me I can hear David begin to mumble under his breath I will magnify the Lord at all times I will greatly lift his name and all times whole but David what about your family what about your children I will magnify the Lord let everything that hath breath praise ye the Lord let everything that's within me praise the Lord let everything in my spirit praise the Lord I can imagine as David begin to get anointed David said his praise will continually be from my mouth I will magnify the Lord at all times don't you realize brother sometimes that's what we need to do don't put a magnifying glass on your problem put a magnifying glass on your God put a magnifying glass on his promises don't let the devil blow up your problems put a magnifying glass on the scripture that says I will never leave you nor forsake you to the end of the world I'll be a God of comfort and peace and help in the time of need I can imagine David's same glorify the Lord with me let us exalt his name together I saw the Lord and he answered me he delivered me from all my fears those who look at me in a radiant their faces are now never covered with shame this poor man called and the Lord heard him that's the words of David this poor man cried unto God and the God of heaven heard this poor man's try I waited patiently for the Lord and he turned to me and heard me cry as the deer panteth after the water Brooks so my soul panted after thee O God I will look to the hills from whence cometh my help where does my help come from the Bible says he encouraged himself in the Lord I could imagine as the songs began to rise from his body from his mouth as he began to say many are they increased that trouble me many there be that say of my soul there's no help for you in God's a law but I say that's what the devil says that's what the enemy says but here's what I say thou Lord are a shield for me you're the glory and the lifter up of my head hallelujah I can imagine David's voice beginning to get louder as the anointing begin to encourage him and David says give me an ephod and David takes the ephod and asks God shall I pursue or shall I overtake and God says David because you can encourage yourself in the Lord here's the word of the Lord from you and my brother and my sister when I studied for this sermon God put these words upon my mouth and said tell the people
