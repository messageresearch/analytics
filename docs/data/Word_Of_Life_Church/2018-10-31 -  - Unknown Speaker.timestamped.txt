[0:00] but unless I know that I know that I
[0:02] know that you're with me I can't go
[0:05] another day I can't go forward I can't
[0:08] go and make any progress Lord I've got
[0:10] to know you're there and you'll never
[0:12] leave me and you'll never forsake me and
[0:15] your abiding presence is with me before
[0:18] I go forward Lord because without your
[0:24] presence it is nothing more than a
[0:26] man-made attempt at serving God and I
[0:32] say to you today that unless your
[0:33] Christianity has the presence of Jesus
[0:36] Christ in it then your Christian life is
[0:39] nothing more than a man-made attempt at
[0:42] being good unless your life has the
[0:50] presence of God in it unless my life is
[0:53] backed up by a living God I have nothing
[0:56] more than a dress code a rule book of
[0:58] do's and don'ts and a lager a self-help
[1:01] book on how to be a better person
[1:03] how about how to how about how to
[1:04] influence people and how to how to live
[1:06] a good clean life oh but my brother I
[1:09] don't want that just here tonight I want
[1:11] my life not just to be a life of what I
[1:14] do and what I don't do I wanted to be a
[1:16] breathing God who breathed upon my life
[1:19] a literal reality that I hold within my
[1:22] soul if your presence isn't with me
[1:27] every day of my life then Lord it's not
[1:30] worth it it doesn't matter the ups or
[1:34] the downs it doesn't matter the highs
[1:36] are the lows let the presence of God
[1:39] abide with me always look at first verse
[1:45] 15 again and he said unto Him at thy
[1:46] presence going out with me carry us up
[1:49] not hence he was saying Lord if your
[1:52] presence is not with me I'm not going
[1:54] anywhere
[1:55] I won't take another single step unless
[1:59] I have an assurance we need to get to
[2:03] that place with the Lord but I believe
[2:06] some of us need to get to that place
[2:07] with the Lord just say Lord you want me
[2:10] to go forward but I ain't going forward
[2:12] unless you're with me
[2:13] oh it was a desperation for Moses it was
[2:17] like Jacob who can say I'm not leaving
[2:20] until you bless me until I know I'm
[2:23] different
[2:24] until I know I've been changed oh I can
[2:27] hear about it I can confess it I can
[2:29] read your word or what it says but Jacob
[2:31] said I've got to know I've been changed
[2:33] I'm different I'm not the person I used
[2:36] to be I'm not leaving until you bless me
[2:39] Lord always the song says I won't be
[2:42] denied I'm gonna get my blessing and if
[2:45] I have to stay here you'll find my bones
[2:47] at this altar but I'm gonna receive my
[2:50] blessing from the Lord because I can't
[2:53] live without him I can't serve or walk
[2:55] this Christian life without him I can't
[2:57] go forward unless you go with me Moses
[3:05] says don't even carry us up if your
[3:11] presence is not with me don't even send
[3:14] me
