[9:50] it a miracle. God is so good. Amen.
[9:56] Amen. Another testimony tonight. Uh
[9:59] Sister Phoebe Torres. It says, "God is
[10:01] so good to us." Some of you know that my
[10:03] brother is dealing with colurectal
[10:06] cancer after having 30 rounds of
[10:08] chemotherapy and radiation. He had a
[10:11] couple of scans showing that he had a
[10:12] very large lymph node, probably infected
[10:15] with cancer, and they needed to biopsy.
[10:17] It uh today he was scheduled for the
[10:19] biopsy. Says she had went up for prayer
[10:22] for him in the prayer line. Also went
[10:24] back and asked brother Donnie to pray
[10:25] for a prayer cloth. Uh she took the
[10:27] prayer cloth to her brother. He placed
[10:29] it in the area. It said her brother was
[10:32] very thankful for it. After he placed it
[10:34] on the area, uh didn't think anything
[10:36] about it. today when he went to have the
[10:38] biopsy they they couldn't do the biopsy
[10:41] because the large lymph node was not
[10:44] showing on the scans just being a
[10:46] regular lymph node. So now the doctors
[10:48] want to proceed with the surgery. God
[10:50] has performed another miracle tonight.
[10:52] So amen. Praise the Lord for those
[10:54] testimonies tonight.
[10:57] Amen. This time we just want to read the

[13:29] Father. We're your children. We can
[13:31] trust in you. We can rest in you,
[13:33] knowing that you have the answer that we

[13:38] and patience, we'll get there. Father,
[13:41] speak to us from your word. Meet the
[13:43] needs of your people, Father. And maybe
[13:45] Lord, it's people that just have heard
[13:48] about how you heal or you've put it on
[13:51] the hearts of your people to pray for
[13:53] somebody else. But Lord, as Peter and
[13:55] them did, they freely receive. They
[13:57] freely give back. So we commit this

[24:56] you still bring water from the rock
[25:01] to satisfy my thirst.
[25:06] You love me at my worst.
[25:09] And even when I don't remember,
[25:14] you remind me of my worth.

[26:59] no. If you say release, I'm letting go.
[27:05] If you're in it with me, I'll begin. And
[27:09] when you say to jump, I'm diving in. If
[27:14] you say be still, then I will wait. If
[27:18] you say to trust, I will oy. You're the
[27:22] only truth
[27:24] the way untaste and feed the days. So

[28:25] city,
[28:28] where the light
[28:30] of heaven's glory
[28:34] will never
[28:37] grow dim.
[28:42] And I shake hands
[28:45] with the Savior
[28:48] who gave me life eternal.
[28:54] I'd like to talk it over
[28:59] with him.
[29:05] I'd like
[29:10] to kneel down
[29:17] and talk it
[29:20] all over
[29:23] with him.
[29:28] I'd like
[29:33] to say it, Lord.
[29:39] How could you love me
[29:42] when my path was
[29:46] so dim?
[29:51] I can
[29:56] not
[29:57] repay him.
[30:01] Oh,
[30:02] when I meet him
[30:06] in that city
[30:09] above,

[30:19] to talk it over
[30:26] and thank him
[30:29] for his Wonderful
[30:32] love.

[30:40] hallelujah
[30:43] forever
[30:46] and ever.
[30:49] For we're told
[30:51] the cup of gladness
[30:55] he'll feel to
[30:58] the brim.
[31:04] But I know that
[31:06] I have brought him
[31:09] some deep tears
[31:12] of sorrow.
[31:15] I'd like
[31:17] to talk it over
[31:20] with you.
[31:26] I'd like
[31:31] to kneel down
[31:38] and talk it
[31:41] all over
[31:44] with him.
[31:49] I'd like
[31:54] to say, Lord,
[31:58] my Lord, how could you love me
[32:04] when my path was so dear?
[32:12] I can
[32:17] not
[32:18] repay him.
[32:22] Oh, when I meet him
[32:27] in that city
[32:30] above,
[32:35] but I'd like

[32:50] for his Wonderful
[32:53] love.

[33:10] and talking
[33:13] all over
[33:16] with you.
[33:21] I like
[33:27] to say Lord,
[33:32] thank you Lord for loving me
[33:36] when my path was
[33:39] so deep.
[33:45] I can
[33:49] not
[33:51] repay him.

[34:47] working on inspiration.
[34:50] its inspiration through
[34:53] glass. It's only partially lit up
[34:58] and they write of their perspective
[35:01] looking at it from now.
[35:04] Once we get there, we may not have a lot
[35:06] of questions really.
[35:10] When the prophet went beyond the curtain
[35:11] of time,
[35:13] it was not those people there asking him
[35:16] questions because of lack of
[35:18] understanding. It was him asking them.
[35:22] And the reason was because he had not
[35:24] actually went through the sleep of death
[35:30] because in that word formed body they
[35:33] had the answers.
[35:36] He asked this, they answered. He asked
[35:38] this, they answered. He asked this. They
[35:40] answered.
[35:42] But we do know, Lord, when we get there
[35:44] that day, that
[35:46] our time with you will be so sacred and
[35:50] so precious to us.
[35:53] Each of us, no doubt, think about what
[35:54] it'll be like when it's our time when we
[35:58] get to see you face to face.
[36:01] But Lord, there's one thing we know for
[36:03] sure. You've made a way for us that we
[36:06] can get there. that is settled what all
[36:10] will happen the way it'll come about.
[36:13] You chose not to make that so clear to
[36:15] us and it must be for a reason. Well, we
[36:19] know that you made the vital things, the
[36:22] required things, you made them clear to
[36:25] us and that's the way to get there.
[36:29] So once we get there, then all these
[36:32] other things no doubt will just be
[36:34] unfolded. And we know that your being is
[36:37] so great and so awesome that through
[36:41] eternity, you will still be revealing
[36:45] yourself.
[36:46] So we have so much to look forward to.
[36:50] Lord, I hold in my hand tonight three
[36:52] prayer calls and you know the needs of
[36:55] all these individuals. I'm asking you
[36:58] for your mercy tonight, Father, healing,
[37:01] deliverance.
[37:03] Jesus, would you move by your power? We
[37:06] thank you for the opportunity that we
[37:08] could be gathered together as we come to
[37:11] pull our feet as it were under your
[37:13] table. Once again, before we eat this
[37:17] meal, we want to bow our heads and say,
[37:20] "Thank you
[37:21] &gt;&gt; for the supper that you provided for us
[37:24] tonight. It will not be bread and wine,
[37:28] but it'll be the unfailing body word of
[37:30] the son of man as we will feed upon it
[37:34] to nourish us and strengthen us Lord for
[37:37] the battles of life. Be with us we pray
[37:40] tonight father in Jesus name we ask and
[37:43] the church said
[37:44] &gt;&gt; amen.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Are you happy to be in
[37:48] the house of the Lord?
[37:51] I just was kind of curious if anybody
[37:54] had been tried with their patience since
[37:57] Sunday.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; I told Carol, "I ain't never preaching
[38:06] on patience in my life again."
[38:09] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; But of course, I was only teaching.
[38:15] Carol and Lis and I left here Sunday
[38:17] going to Kentucky and got on the other
[38:20] side of Knoxville and I picked up a
[38:21] piece of metal and our front tire on our
[38:24] car.
[38:26] Cut the sidewall. Couldn't be rep re
[38:30] patched and replaced. Had to be
[38:31] replaced. I called AAA of which I have
[38:35] been a proud member
[38:38] since 1986.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; Wow. and they told me my membership had
[38:43] it expired in November of 24.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; So, would you like to share with me your
[38:52] trial of patience?
[38:55] Anybody need to know anything about the
[38:57] aisles in Walmart? Because Carol and Lis
[39:01] and I walked up and down them aisles and
[39:03] up and down them aisles for over two
[39:06] hours waiting for them to replace a tire
[39:09] for us.
[39:11] at Walmart. I hate Walmart on a good
[39:14] day.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; Now, I wanted to share this with y'all
[39:20] tonight just in case some of you all had
[39:22] the office Monday that ever was to
[39:25] realize you wasn't by yourself.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; But ain't God good?
[39:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; So, we're walking through Walmart and
[39:33] Carol said, "Well, think about it. The
[39:35] Lord may have spared us from a terrible
[39:38] accident." I said, "Did it take three
[39:41] hours
[39:49] before you have need of patience?"
[39:52] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Amen, Lord."
[39:56] So, everybody can quit sweating. I'm not
[39:58] preaching on patience tonight. We're
[40:00] going back to Eleaser.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Thank God."
[40:07] Genesis chapter 24 verse 53.
[40:13] Praise the Lord. So if you're wondering
[40:15] about my AAA,
[40:18] they reinstated it,
[40:21] but they also charged me an extra $60
[40:24] because I had to wait, you know, cuz I
[40:27] need service that day. So we sat there
[40:29] and wait, wait and wait, and the guy
[40:30] shows up about 45 minutes later, puts
[40:33] the Spirit on and then tells me you can
[40:34] only drive 50 m hour. can only drive
[40:36] this car for 50 mi. I said, "What am I
[40:39] going to do?" He said, "That's up to
[40:40] you."
[40:42] So, we went up to one, exit 122, North
[40:44] 75, went into Walmart, and thank God
[40:48] they had a tire. I don't care if it's
[40:50] made in China.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's made in Timbuktu. I
[40:53] did not want to drive 50 miles an hour.
[40:58] Praise the Lord. That's life, ain't it?
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. But ain't God good? Yes.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; I said, "Ain't God good?"
[41:09] &gt;&gt; Genesis 24:53.
[41:12] Now, there's one thing we know for sure.
[41:15] Rebecca's fixing to take off on that
[41:17] camel train, and she was not going to
[41:19] have a flat
[41:20] &gt;&gt; cuz camels don't have tires.
[41:24] But no doubt,
[41:27] she had a lot of questions.
[41:29] I wonder all the emotions. I made a note
[41:33] of it this evening that she must have
[41:35] experienced
[41:37] on this 450 mile or so journey on the
[41:41] back of a camel.
[41:44] I wonder the worry, the anxiety mixed
[41:46] with happiness and excitement and all
[41:49] that together. Sort of like our journey.
[41:53] Genesis 24:53.
[41:55] And the servant brought forth jewels of
[41:58] silver and jewels of gold and rayment
[42:03] and gave them to Rebecca.
[42:08] Now remember this is her personal gift
[42:11] from her bridegroom.
[42:14] And he gave also to her brother and to
[42:17] her mother precious things. and they did
[42:21] eat and drink, he and the men that were
[42:25] with him, and tried all night. Then rose
[42:31] up in the morning, and he said, "Send me
[42:34] away unto my master." Now, everything
[42:37] had gone really good
[42:40] until he preaches to them a message of
[42:45] separating
[42:47] from those who are not bride. Oh my.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Then they start having some issues.
[42:55] So he rose up early in the morning and
[42:57] he said, "Send me away unto my master."
[43:01] So now remember, they just met this man
[43:04] the day before.
[43:06] He's asking them to release their
[43:08] 16-year-old daughter to go with him on a
[43:12] 450 mile plus journey.
[43:17] Now notice, and her brother and her
[43:20] mother said, "Let the damsel
[43:25] abide with us a few days,
[43:28] at least 10."
[43:31] After that, she
[43:34] shall go. May the Lord bless his word.
[43:36] You may be seated.
[43:43] There's something about a higher call
[43:46] that always demands
[43:49] separation from unbelief.
[43:52] Now, by that I don't mean that we don't
[43:55] speak to people and we're not nice to
[43:58] people and try to do everything we can
[44:01] to express the Lord Jesus and his mercy
[44:04] that he's given to us to others. But as
[44:08] far as agreeing, being nice doesn't mean
[44:12] we harmonize our doctrinal beliefs with
[44:16] people that don't believe what you
[44:17] believe. But we're nice. We're
[44:20] Christians. We have a good attitude
[44:21] toward them. But in this case, it was
[44:25] going to require total separation from
[44:30] her brother and from her mother's house,
[44:34] never to return again. There's no
[44:38] scriptural record or no historical
[44:40] record that I've been able to find that
[44:43] after she leaves
[44:46] their house, she ever even makes one
[44:50] visit back to see her family. Are you
[44:54] talking about a sacrifice
[44:57] for this young lady? No wonder it took
[45:01] an angelic visitation to make it so
[45:05] profound and supernatural to her that it
[45:09] would help calm her doubts and her
[45:12] fears. Now remember, don't make these
[45:15] characters in the Bible so supernatural
[45:20] and so phenomenal that they did not have
[45:23] some of the same battles that you and I
[45:26] have. No doubt they did or they could
[45:29] never be used as our examples.
[45:33] So it has went well thus far. She's
[45:37] responded at the well. She responded by
[45:41] her works, her actions, and her
[45:44] verbiage, her word. So he said
[45:48] something, she responded the right way.
[45:50] He said something, she acted the right
[45:54] way. So actions plus word is being read
[45:58] in to this image that is being formed in
[46:02] this messenger's mind. Now he knows his
[46:06] master Abraham and his master's son. He
[46:11] must size up as we would say this young
[46:14] woman. Will she be a perfect fit for
[46:19] Isaac? As I've said before, most of us
[46:22] would not want this responsibility to
[46:25] take this girl back and say, "Okay,
[46:28] she's the one." Isaac didn't second
[46:31] guessess him. Abraham didn't second
[46:33] guessess him. He took her straight back,
[46:35] met him in the middle of the field to
[46:38] she jumped off the camel, took her to
[46:40] his mother's tent, and he knew her as
[46:44] his wife.
[46:46] So much for greet and meet. So much for
[46:51] getting to know her. You talking about
[46:54] trusting this servant. They don't even
[46:58] have a formal meet and greet. How are
[47:02] you? My name is Isaac. My name is
[47:04] Rebecca. But he sees him out in the
[47:07] field. They see him. He sees her. She
[47:10] lights off the camel. He takes her
[47:13] straight to his mother's tent and goes
[47:15] into her and knows her as his wife.
[47:21] What could have happened
[47:24] in this journey that made this woman so
[47:28] want to surrender everything she was to
[47:33] this man? And this man so trusted his
[47:39] messenger that he believed this
[47:42] messenger would serve him faithfully.
[47:49] Oh my. And it would happen in such a
[47:54] rapid pace. Unbelievable.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Unless of course it's supernatural.
[48:02] Now watch. The servant brought forth
[48:08] jewels of silver
[48:10] and jewels of gold and raignment
[48:15] and gave them to Rebecca.
[48:19] No jewels of gold, no jewels of silver,
[48:23] no raignment to Laban and her mother.
[48:29] They are not dressed
[48:32] for the wedding.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; You know why? They won't be there.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; But now watch, he does give them things.
[48:46] They are benefited
[48:49] by his appearing.
[48:54] They hear the bride call,
[48:58] but it's not personal to them.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Now, they're in the process of a bride
[49:07] being called out.
[49:10] They see the interaction going on
[49:13] between the bride and the messenger and
[49:18] the men's servants.
[49:21] But it's not exactly for them.
[49:26] How strange.
[49:28] But yet, I wonder if it's not went on
[49:31] exactly the same way and every age since
[49:35] then.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; And believe it or not, it's going on
[49:39] tonight. Amen.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; So there's something between God's
[49:46] messengers
[49:47] and the recipients of the message that
[49:52] is totally
[49:54] different than the people who associate
[49:59] with those who receive the bride call.
[50:04] They may be part of them, part of their
[50:06] family, love them, have respect for
[50:09] them, even have a good word to say about
[50:13] the messenger,
[50:15] &gt;&gt; but somehow they connect to it in a
[50:20] different way. It's at a distance for
[50:24] them. And to be honest, they feel quite
[50:28] at home with that distance.
[50:32] but not the bride.
[50:35] Rebecca did not refuse the gold, nor the
[50:40] silver, nor the raignment. Now, we know
[50:43] Laban well enough to know the way he
[50:46] loved money, he would not have rejected
[50:49] the gold nor the silver either, but he
[50:52] could not receive it because of the type
[50:56] that it was being set up. This was the
[50:59] bride's gift from the groom and Laban
[51:03] definitely was not bride.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Now I want you to notice that in the
[51:09] parallel of what God has done in our
[51:12] day.
[51:14] Excuse me. Again, God sent another
[51:19] messenger. Now, he sent Paul. And Paul
[51:22] likened himself of course to being the
[51:24] friend of the bridegroom as John the
[51:26] Baptist did. And Paul, even though we
[51:30] have no scripture written saying that
[51:33] Paul had that authority, but it was
[51:36] revealed to Paul that he did. Yet Peter
[51:39] never said that he espoused them to
[51:42] Christ.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Nor did James, nor did John.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Is that true? Yet Paul said he did.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[51:53] &gt;&gt; So here Paul had a special affinity
[51:57] bringing the message of the day. And and
[52:00] to be honest with you, of all the
[52:02] apostles, he still has an special
[52:05] affinity with the bride of this day.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Where would we be if we
[52:11] did not have the Pauline epistles as
[52:13] they are so called?
[52:15] So think now that God makes a special
[52:19] affinity between men that are of this
[52:23] caliber that are different even than the
[52:26] other men who are their helpers. Now I
[52:30] believe that God has men today that are
[52:32] called to take this message and preach
[52:35] it as the prophet told us that they
[52:37] would. But will the bride ever have that
[52:41] same affinity with their pastor or their
[52:44] favorite evangelist or teacher that she
[52:47] does with that prophet messenger of the
[52:49] age? No, she won't. Now, you have a
[52:52] special love for your pastor. You should
[52:54] anyway. And that love for your pastor is
[52:56] different than a love for your your
[52:59] evangelist that you really like or a
[53:01] teacher that you really like. But
[53:03] there's something about that prophet
[53:05] messenger that even carried beyond the
[53:08] curtain of time that whenever he went
[53:10] there, here come all these millions of
[53:14] people in that sixth dimension and they
[53:16] were screaming our precious brother, our
[53:19] precious brother. Now, if I go by the
[53:22] way of the grave and I'm carried up into
[53:24] that sixth dimension, there might be 25
[53:27] or 30 or 40, maybe 100, I don't know.
[53:30] There might be a handful of people that
[53:33] will come up running up to me and
[53:35] saying, "Our precious brother." People
[53:37] that I've helped along the way, but I
[53:40] will never have the place in the economy
[53:44] of God that the prophet messenger will
[53:47] have. Brother Donnie, don't that bother
[53:49] you? Not one bit.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; It don't bother me at all. Remember, it
[53:53] was not promised to me and brother Daryl
[53:56] and the other brother ministers here in
[53:58] our church that a huge portion of heaven
[54:02] awaited me.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. But it is to
[54:08] certain ones and the church said,
[54:10] &gt;&gt; "So, it's the same with Eleazar. Now, he
[54:14] has a great reward, but he has a great
[54:16] responsibility." Now these other men
[54:19] that are with him, he could not do this
[54:22] by himself. He had to have them along
[54:26] with him. And they were helpers in
[54:30] bearing the message and also bearing the
[54:33] bride back to Isaac. I want you to get
[54:36] this in your mind. Elizer did not go by
[54:40] himself, pack all this stuff by himself,
[54:42] did not load up all the camels by
[54:44] himself. He did not bring her back by
[54:47] himself, but he had men that were with
[54:50] him. And word of life said,
[54:53] &gt;&gt; that's right. So now think here. I want
[54:56] you to notice now that brother Brandham
[54:59] whenever he was sent in this age that it
[55:02] was not just the bride alone that would
[55:06] be benefited by his ministry. As a
[55:09] matter of fact, by the one commission
[55:13] from the angel of God, millions of
[55:18] people became Christians.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; By the commission to that one man.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Millions
[55:29] &gt;&gt; of Christians. probably some of your
[55:32] parents or grandparents or or people in
[55:35] your family that got saved actually
[55:38] attributed from one generation down to
[55:40] another to another. And it came because
[55:43] of the results of that one commission to
[55:47] that one little insignificant the way
[55:50] the world would look at it Kentucky
[55:52] Hillbilly.
[55:54] Now I want you to listen to this as he
[55:55] describes as I was with Moses a few
[55:58] years ago when I started. There was none
[56:01] of that going on. He's talking about the
[56:03] supernatural and the great miracles and
[56:06] things that that happened. And he said
[56:08] there was none of that going on. The
[56:09] only thing that this has done and this
[56:12] supernatural has wakened ministers out
[56:17] of the sensebound
[56:20] sensebound
[56:22] realm. Listen. Listen what Pentecost had
[56:27] become. Listen what Isuza Street had
[56:30] turned into.
[56:32] A sensebound
[56:35] realm.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Listen friend. sense bound. What are you
[56:40] talking about, brother Donnie? Feelings,
[56:42] emotions, great estatic this and
[56:45] ecstatic that, jumping, running. We
[56:47] believe in all that, do we not?
[56:49] &gt;&gt; But believe me, I run and jumped and I
[56:52] seen it done. Oh yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.
[56:55] Great things that could happen. And
[56:57] whenever the music all stopped, what
[56:59] happened to the victory then? Come on.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Then it become it was in this realm that
[57:05] he so well identified sense bound. Now I
[57:09] mentioned it to you Sunday about
[57:11] watering plants that if you water those
[57:13] plants shallow and you water you shallow
[57:16] water those plants then the roots
[57:19] instead of going deeper in the ground
[57:21] will reach up to the top of the ground
[57:24] and they will grow right around the top
[57:26] of the ground. And when we get these 92
[57:28] and 93 degree days is going to happen in
[57:31] the next five or six days, you know
[57:33] what's going to happen to them if you
[57:34] don't want them? They're going to die
[57:36] because an inch and a half to 2 in deep.
[57:39] And that sun is going to dry that ground
[57:42] out and it's going to crack and bust
[57:44] open and them roots laying right under
[57:46] the surface will die. And that plant
[57:48] will dry up and die. And that's the way
[57:52] sensebound Christians are. They're
[57:55] strong and they're great in faith as
[57:57] long as they're having dreams and
[57:59] visions and sensation and emotions, but
[58:02] let if God lets them go through a dry
[58:04] spell for about a month or two or three,
[58:08] then they think God's forsook them. They
[58:10] don't know what in the world's going on.
[58:12] You know why? Sensebound
[58:14] realm.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; But real faith can say amen when you're
[58:19] shouting. Real faith can say praise God
[58:22] when you're shouting. And real faith can
[58:24] say praise God when you ain't shouted in
[58:27] 6 months.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; If it's so dry, you know, it seemed like
[58:30] it's like out on the desert somewhere.
[58:33] Real faith can say I believe him. The
[58:35] Lord give and the Lord took away blessed
[58:38] be the name of the Lord.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Now notice what that developed into that
[58:43] great move which started in 1906. Notice
[58:46] this year in 1951.
[58:48] And he he's re rehearsing now what God
[58:51] did by the commission from the angel of
[58:54] God to where now notice what that God
[58:57] wanted to do to bring them from the
[58:59] sensebound realm into a place to where
[59:03] they see God is present. That's an
[59:06] awesome thing to see that God is present
[59:10] whether you feel him or whether you
[59:12] don't. I hope everybody here tonight
[59:14] sees that and believes that. How many's
[59:16] ever been through them dry spots in your
[59:17] life and it felt like God was a million
[59:19] miles away and you'd give anything if
[59:22] you just knew he even knew your address?
[59:24] And yet whenever you realize that this
[59:27] is what the message is to bring to us
[59:30] that his omnipotence is omnipresence is
[59:34] always with us and in us whether we feel
[59:37] it or not.
[59:40] Now notice this is what he's supposed to
[59:42] do then to bring them where they see God
[59:45] is present to that that they take his
[59:48] word and start a healing campaign and
[59:51] God heals the sick. Now that's exactly
[59:54] see search it through anywhere you want
[59:56] to and see if there's any more
[59:58] supernatural than that. That's right.
[1:00:02] But wonderful what God is doing. He
[1:00:05] started a universal revival of the
[1:00:09] outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Now,
[1:00:12] we're very thankful for that. And where
[1:00:14] did it come from? By the Eleer Anatite
[1:00:19] sent to call a bride. But with that
[1:00:23] commission, it was going to start
[1:00:26] revival fires and the Assembly of God
[1:00:29] and the Church of God and the Baptist
[1:00:31] and the Cleveland Assembly and the
[1:00:34] Northern Assembly and the Methodist and
[1:00:36] the this and that and the other. They
[1:00:38] was going to have such outpourings of
[1:00:40] the spirit of God and great revivals was
[1:00:43] going to be on every fire. Revival fires
[1:00:47] he called it lit on every hill. And
[1:00:50] where did it come from? that one
[1:00:52] commission to his Eleer servant.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Now, they would rejoice in his original
[1:01:00] commission and they would go to his
[1:01:03] meetings for healing and he would preach
[1:01:06] some really phenomenal things and start
[1:01:10] letting things out even in the 50s about
[1:01:13] the Serpent Sea. And there was some guys
[1:01:15] that was with him that whatever he
[1:01:17] preached on the serpent sea and they let
[1:01:20] them tapes out in the early years. And
[1:01:22] brother Brandham makes an apology and he
[1:01:25] said, "Now I I know some of you all got
[1:01:27] that tape." And he said, "I'm real
[1:01:29] sorry. You know, them boys that did
[1:01:31] that, they're not with me anymore. I I
[1:01:33] I'm real sorry that it got out among
[1:01:35] them." Now, why is he apologizing for
[1:01:38] the truth? He's not apologizing for the
[1:01:40] truth. He's apologizing because it was
[1:01:44] not the season for it quite to be let
[1:01:47] out yet. You see, the bride was still
[1:01:49] mauling around in Pentecost and Baptist
[1:01:52] and the organization and it could
[1:01:54] absolutely hinder some of them if they
[1:01:57] got the season mixed up.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; So then of course he apologized, you
[1:02:03] know, I'm very sorry that that happened.
[1:02:05] But as it moved on after the opening of
[1:02:08] the seals and then he said people said,
[1:02:10] "I've got to withdraw my tapes." He
[1:02:13] said, "I ain't withdrawing them. I'm
[1:02:15] making more." Now notice what happened.
[1:02:18] The son of man had now moved into the
[1:02:21] stage of his ministry. And it was not
[1:02:25] what people thought all of these years
[1:02:27] that it was going to be the phenario,
[1:02:30] which is the visible return of the son
[1:02:33] of man. But it was going to be the
[1:02:36] spiritual return of the son of man that
[1:02:40] would be when he is revealed
[1:02:44] revealed apocalyppsis that the cover
[1:02:48] would be took off of the son of man. So
[1:02:51] it was not that it was going to be a
[1:02:54] corpal return. Now remember Jesus was
[1:02:56] the one that quoted these in Luke 21:36,
[1:02:59] Matthew 24:24 and and all these other
[1:03:02] places and said the son of man, the son
[1:03:04] of man, the son of man. And he was the
[1:03:07] one that altered it. And what have
[1:03:09] theologians done? They took the same
[1:03:11] terminology and applied every one of
[1:03:13] them to the same appearing of the son of
[1:03:16] man. That ain't what Jesus even said in
[1:03:19] the first place. He used two and three
[1:03:21] different Greek words at times whenever
[1:03:24] he would say his appearing or his
[1:03:26] coming. So one of them is simply a
[1:03:29] manifestation of his person when the
[1:03:32] cover is took off to where some people
[1:03:36] will be allowed to see him as he is. And
[1:03:40] it won't be just in that corporal return
[1:03:43] at that time. And we're looking for
[1:03:46] that, are we not? But when we're talking
[1:03:48] about the manifestation of the son of
[1:03:50] man that has already been here in the
[1:03:53] last days, that is not the corporal
[1:03:55] return, but it is the apocalypsis that
[1:03:59] the cover has been took off of him. And
[1:04:01] we see
[1:04:04] oh my oh that that's him. That's his
[1:04:07] person. That's the way he's revealing
[1:04:09] himself. How do we know him? By the way
[1:04:11] he breaks the bread. And then the
[1:04:13] prophet there in 1960 would say, "I'm
[1:04:16] not here to tell you that he's coming,
[1:04:18] but I'm here to tell you he is here."
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Well, my goodness, that was before 63.
[1:04:26] That was before the angels appeared down
[1:04:28] there. What was it? It's a manifestation
[1:04:30] of fan of real also. So, the cover is
[1:04:34] being taken off. But will everybody see
[1:04:37] that? They won't. Will they believe it?
[1:04:40] Oh, some of them if they hear me
[1:04:42] preaching about it tonight, they'll make
[1:04:44] fun of me and there'll be another
[1:04:45] YouTube video made about me, don't doubt
[1:04:48] within a week or two, you know, talking
[1:04:49] about what an idiot I am and how stupid
[1:04:51] I am. Well, if you're going to tell us
[1:04:53] something, tell us something we don't
[1:04:54] already know. We already know that. So,
[1:04:57] you know, but I have the ability, I'm
[1:04:59] unlike the folks that have left the
[1:05:01] message. I'll have the ability to listen
[1:05:04] to the tapes and hear the human side.
[1:05:06] But I don't just hear the voice of a
[1:05:08] Kuckan, but I also hear the voice behind
[1:05:12] the voice. And that's the one that's
[1:05:14] calling me. You see, the human side does
[1:05:17] not make me stumble. If I would have
[1:05:19] lived in the days of Noah and I found
[1:05:22] out that Mo that Mo had got drunk, I
[1:05:25] wouldn't go back and destroy everything
[1:05:27] that that man ever said and said, "That
[1:05:29] man was a false prophet. That man
[1:05:31] building that ark." Well, he's off the
[1:05:33] word. That man got drunk. According to
[1:05:36] your Bible, Moses, if id have lived in
[1:05:39] his day and I found out that Moses
[1:05:41] didn't even circumcise his own son, come
[1:05:44] on, somebody, let's have church tonight.
[1:05:47] Would we have put up a YouTube video and
[1:05:49] said, "Why I no longer follow the cult."
[1:05:52] Moses leader, that man was a cult. He
[1:05:55] was out there telling all the rest of us
[1:05:57] to circumcise our kids. And now we've
[1:06:00] got the news. Flash news. Moses didn't
[1:06:03] even have his own boy circumcised and
[1:06:06] God met him down at the end and God was
[1:06:08] going to kill him.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; And that's your prophet.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; You lived in that day and you said, "Are
[1:06:15] you going to follow that man called
[1:06:16] Moses?" Why God? He must have been so
[1:06:19] low down and so rotten that God was
[1:06:21] going to kill him. And you know who
[1:06:23] saved his life? His wife did. and his
[1:06:26] wife circumcised her son and took the
[1:06:28] foreskin and throwed it at his feet and
[1:06:30] said, "You're a bloody husband to me."
[1:06:33] Remember the prophet said that Moses had
[1:06:35] a real bad temper and he said Zapora had
[1:06:38] a real bad temper. He said, "I can
[1:06:40] imagine they had some pretty rough times
[1:06:42] out there in the desert."
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; So what if you'd have lived in that age
[1:06:47] and you'd walk by Moses and Zapora's
[1:06:49] tent and you heard them fussing and
[1:06:51] growling like two badgers. And boy, she
[1:06:53] said, "You say that to me, Mosy, and
[1:06:56] I'll pick up this frying pan and hit you
[1:06:58] on the side of the head." He said,
[1:06:59] "Zipper, you better zip that lip because
[1:07:02] I'll tell you one thing. I'm a prophet
[1:07:04] of God. You want me to call fire down
[1:07:07] out of heaven? You better zip your lip,
[1:07:09] woman." And sis, I'm getting tired of
[1:07:11] you, Mosy. Here I come with this number
[1:07:14] nine frying pan. And you walked by and
[1:07:17] you went to your home and said, "Dear
[1:07:19] God, have mercy.
[1:07:24] You won't believe what I just heard.
[1:07:27] I heard our prophet messenger and his
[1:07:30] wife in the office argument that you can
[1:07:33] imagine. I've always wondered them
[1:07:36] bruises on his face. I I just thought
[1:07:38] he, you know, I never really realized
[1:07:40] she smacked him
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; and I never realized, you know, now it's
[1:07:44] it's finally come out. We've got the
[1:07:46] truth exposed that Moses was so busy in
[1:07:49] his ministry that he didn't even
[1:07:51] circumcise his own son.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Brother,
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; You see, I have the ability to look at
[1:08:01] prophets and I don't have to make them
[1:08:04] God.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; They can be men. They can fall short of
[1:08:07] the glory of God. They can make mistakes
[1:08:09] cuz every prophet of God did that lived
[1:08:12] on the earth except for the God prophet
[1:08:14] and that was Jesus Christ. Paul made
[1:08:16] them. Come on somebody. John made them.
[1:08:19] Jeremiah made them. Ezekiel made them.
[1:08:22] They all make them. So if you're going
[1:08:24] to stop following prophets because they
[1:08:26] made mistakes. Guess what? You might as
[1:08:28] well destroy the most of your Bible
[1:08:31] because it was written by God's
[1:08:34] prophets. But I thank God that God used
[1:08:36] men that are full of flaws. I can follow
[1:08:39] men that make mistakes. I can't follow a
[1:08:42] man that never admits when he's wrong. I
[1:08:45] can't follow a man that'll never tell
[1:08:47] you I fell short of the glory of God.
[1:08:49] There's something wrong with that
[1:08:50] hypocrite. Come on, somebody. Oh,
[1:08:54] hallelujah. that I can get right in line
[1:08:56] behind a man that'll say, "Pray for me
[1:08:59] that I'll regain that love I lost during
[1:09:03] that complex."
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Amen. Notice this. And seeds on
[1:09:13] air of the shop. When the message first
[1:09:16] started out, it was of course everybody
[1:09:18] was praying for the sick. great signs,
[1:09:20] wonders, and miracles that started
[1:09:22] especially in the Pentecostal people. A
[1:09:25] universal revival of healing campaigns
[1:09:28] that swept the world.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; For 15 solid years, there's been
[1:09:37] revivals on every hill there is. I
[1:09:39] suppose revival fires burning. Literally
[1:09:43] millions have accepted Christ as their
[1:09:46] savior
[1:09:48] by that one commission.
[1:09:54] So Laban and Rebecca's mother benefited
[1:09:59] greatly.
[1:10:01] The Assembly of God, the Church of God,
[1:10:03] the Baptist, the Methodist, the
[1:10:04] Presbyterian. They ain't no telling how
[1:10:05] many of them they've got because God's
[1:10:07] prophet back in the 50s prayed for a
[1:10:10] grandfather that fathered a son and then
[1:10:12] they had another one and now they may be
[1:10:14] your cousin or may even be you and he
[1:10:17] prayed for them. One of the main enemies
[1:10:19] against this message right now that's
[1:10:21] trying to promote his books and all that
[1:10:23] bunch of nonsense. Had it not been for a
[1:10:25] prayer from the prophet of God, this man
[1:10:28] wouldn't even be alive today.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Because when his relative was at the age
[1:10:35] of nine or 10, whatever it was, with
[1:10:37] leukemia
[1:10:38] and was given up to die, not live, and
[1:10:41] God's prophet prayed for him. Had he not
[1:10:44] live, this man would have never been
[1:10:46] alive himself. But instead of following
[1:10:49] the word, he's become one of the worst
[1:10:51] enemies that there is of it. God. And
[1:10:53] one day when they stand before Almighty
[1:10:55] God, you imagine when they walk up
[1:10:57] before the throne and the judgment of
[1:10:59] God's going to look them in the eye,
[1:11:01] what will be their answer then? I'll
[1:11:03] tell you one thing, friend. I don't plan
[1:11:05] on walking before the judgment throne of
[1:11:07] God. Do you? I believe with all of my
[1:11:11] heart, I have something in me. I believe
[1:11:14] you have something in you to respond to
[1:11:17] this message. I don't just want precious
[1:11:20] things. I want gold. I want silver. I
[1:11:24] want raignment. Oh, hallelujah. They got
[1:11:27] conversions. They got churches. They got
[1:11:29] this or that. I want the bridegroom.
[1:11:33] Don't just give me gifts from the
[1:11:35] bridegroom. I want the bridegroom
[1:11:37] himself.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:11:44] Think of the thousands of people that
[1:11:47] were healed and saved.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; That's right. under or Robert's ministry
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; and where did he get a lot of his
[1:11:56] influence from Eluser
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; T Oburn traveled all over the world
[1:12:04] all you got to do is a little casual
[1:12:06] church search rather on YouTube and
[1:12:08] you'll find assembly of God Pentecostals
[1:12:11] you'll find different ones of them
[1:12:13] making videos and I personally think God
[1:12:15] allows them people to do it to be a
[1:12:18] voice against those others unbelievers
[1:12:20] that's doing what they're doing and no
[1:12:22] doubt they'll stand right there and
[1:12:24] condemn them at the day of judgment
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; cuz they saw the great things of God.
[1:12:29] tell husband daughter I saw a video of
[1:12:31] her the other day there she said bobbed
[1:12:32] hair makeup on everything else look like
[1:12:34] I don't know what and talking about the
[1:12:37] supernatural that she saw as a little
[1:12:39] girl and the presence of being around
[1:12:41] that that prophet of God why they
[1:12:44] benefited what did Tail Osman do went
[1:12:46] and nailed his door shut and stayed
[1:12:48] there until God dealt with him in a
[1:12:51] supernatural way or Roberts all the rest
[1:12:53] of me said those ministry actually come
[1:12:55] out of here and yet thousands times
[1:12:58] thousands of people benefited. But when
[1:13:00] it comes to the message,
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; oh well now
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; you see at the end
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; he got off.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Really?
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Got off of what?
[1:13:22] Amen.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Where they say he got off is what we
[1:13:26] identify as the revealing of the opening
[1:13:28] of the word.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You see, now it's honed
[1:13:35] in that the messenger saying, "Let me go
[1:13:40] with Rebecca."
[1:13:46] The talks have been favorable.
[1:13:49] Things had went nice.
[1:13:52] So he gives them gifts.
[1:13:55] They eat, they sleep, they rest, they
[1:13:59] get up in the morning before daylight.
[1:14:04] They have now given to them the more
[1:14:08] heart.
[1:14:10] It was a payment actually for the
[1:14:15] family's loss
[1:14:18] cuz she was leaving.
[1:14:21] Verse 54. They did eat and drink. And he
[1:14:23] and the men that were with him,
[1:14:26] terried all night,
[1:14:28] and they rose up early in the morning,
[1:14:30] and he said,
[1:14:32] "Send me away
[1:14:35] unto my master." Let me tell you
[1:14:37] something. If you want to know if a
[1:14:38] man's a real servant of God, this right
[1:14:40] here is a dead giveaway. Watch him in
[1:14:43] his mission. Watch him in his
[1:14:45] testimonies. Watch him in every aspect
[1:14:48] of his life and see if he interjects
[1:14:52] himself. I did this. I did that. I did
[1:14:54] that. I did that. I did that. You notice
[1:14:57] this model servant here? None of that is
[1:15:00] brought into view. It's not about him.
[1:15:03] It's not about his personality. I love
[1:15:05] the way Moses even wrote this in the
[1:15:07] scripture because he doesn't even
[1:15:10] mention this servant by name.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; He mentions him by position and office.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. His whole focus is his
[1:15:24] master.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Send me away unto my master. and
[1:15:30] her brother and her mother said, "Let
[1:15:33] the damsel abide with us a few days at
[1:15:36] at the least 10, and after that she
[1:15:40] shall go." So now here they're going to
[1:15:43] run into a little bit of difference and
[1:15:45] it's all about the time of separation.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you friend, this is still
[1:15:53] going on. Separation.
[1:15:56] Let the damsel abide with us for two
[1:15:58] days now. Wouldn't you think that would
[1:16:01] be reasonable?
[1:16:03] So Josh come down from Ohio and met
[1:16:05] Megan several years ago and he tells you
[1:16:09] all, "Brother Dave, Sister Becky, I
[1:16:11] really like her. I'm going to take her
[1:16:13] home with me tomorrow.
[1:16:15] He probably still wouldn't be out of the
[1:16:17] hospital.
[1:16:18] And if he was, he'd be walking like
[1:16:20] this. Dave whooped him. When Dave got
[1:16:22] done, I'd have whooped him.
[1:16:25] He's probably hearing this tonight. He's
[1:16:27] probably smiling, laughing right now.
[1:16:30] And you saying this man expects us to
[1:16:33] let our daughter go with him. We want to
[1:16:36] know about more about him. I want to
[1:16:38] research him and the who's who.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; You won't find him.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Well, I've got to validate this
[1:16:46] testimony. So, we're going to send
[1:16:47] somebody over to check him out.
[1:16:50] 450 miles
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; one way.
[1:16:54] Two and a half months, he comes back.
[1:16:58] Eleer said, "No,
[1:17:00] she's going with me and we're leaving
[1:17:04] today."
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Well, looks like to me, he's getting a
[1:17:07] little bit bossy now, ain't he?
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Uh-oh. I picked up the first thing about
[1:17:13] the warning of the cult.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Uhoh.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; When they go to pulling them away and
[1:17:20] isolating them, he's fixing to pull her
[1:17:23] away now from her family. He didn't
[1:17:25] break no red Kool-Aid, did he? No, I got
[1:17:28] blue tonight.
[1:17:32] Oh, you got to watch him now. Certain
[1:17:34] things, 15 things to watch for in a
[1:17:37] cult.
[1:17:39] And when you read them 15 things, you
[1:17:41] put Jesus in there, Moses in there,
[1:17:43] Jeremiah in there, Ezekiel in there,
[1:17:45] every move of God. Who you figure come
[1:17:47] up with them 15 things? Oh, slew through
[1:17:50] it.
[1:17:53] Amen.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Now you imagine that as it goes
[1:18:00] to getting a little bit sticky.
[1:18:03] So he says,
[1:18:06] no, no, no, no.
[1:18:09] She's going and we're leaving today.
[1:18:14] I said, now wait a minute. Uhhuh. I tell
[1:18:17] you one thing now. I don't know about
[1:18:19] that.
[1:18:20] I mean, you know, we're really just
[1:18:22] taking your word for this this one man
[1:18:24] message stuff and all that sort of thing
[1:18:26] and and you're you're the only one. You
[1:18:28] you say you're the only one and then
[1:18:29] this is the only camel train and and if
[1:18:31] you don't get on that camel train, she
[1:18:32] ain't going boy. I tell you, the more we
[1:18:34] get into this, I tell you it sound like
[1:18:35] to me it ain't nothing but a c straight
[1:18:37] up and down.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; I love this. The prophet said, "Then
[1:18:43] there was another great decision that
[1:18:45] had to be made
[1:18:47] after she was given." Then the parents
[1:18:49] said, "Well, just let her stay around
[1:18:51] about 10 days. Just let her hang around
[1:18:53] the revival and really feel whether
[1:18:56] she's decided to do it or not."
[1:19:00] I love the way he says this. I haven't
[1:19:02] gotten much confidence in a person make
[1:19:05] a decision to wait even until tomorrow.
[1:19:11] Right.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm trying to make up my mind if
[1:19:15] I'm going to serve Jesus.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; I'm 85 years old and I've been thinking
[1:19:20] about him since I was three.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Well, more than likely you never will.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; If it took you that many years to decide
[1:19:27] whether you want to serve him, there
[1:19:29] probably nothing in you know.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Donnie, you shouldn't say that.
[1:19:33] But I should.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Some of you have been waiting for years
[1:19:39] to get the Holy Ghost. What are you
[1:19:41] waiting on?
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; You're waiting to give up this in your
[1:19:44] life and waiting to move away from this
[1:19:46] this family or that family or whatever
[1:19:48] it is. This person ain't good for me. I
[1:19:50] know they ain't but I can't let go of
[1:19:52] them. What do you mean?
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; If you know somebody's influencing you
[1:19:57] the wrong way. What are you doing still
[1:19:59] hanging around them?
[1:20:04] If you're not careful, the devil would
[1:20:06] desensitize you and the next thing you
[1:20:08] know, you're in a trap and cannot get
[1:20:11] out.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; I haven't got much confidence in a
[1:20:19] person and make a decision to wait even
[1:20:21] until tomorrow.
[1:20:24] But the message had stirred Rebecca.
[1:20:29] She was satisfied.
[1:20:31] The message
[1:20:33] was from God.
[1:20:36] Any Rebecca's in here tonight? Are you
[1:20:38] satisfied the message is from God?
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; So the parents said, "Oh, let her stick
[1:20:42] around a while. She'll she'll get over
[1:20:44] it." Uh-huh. Now we get to the real
[1:20:46] terrier motive. She'll get over it. No,
[1:20:50] she wouldn't. Even if she would have
[1:20:52] stayed 10 days, she still wouldn't have
[1:20:54] got over it. She is love struck.
[1:20:58] I tell you one thing, she has been
[1:21:00] smoked. The angel of God come by and hit
[1:21:03] her. She is one loves sick girl. She is
[1:21:06] so lovesick for that man and she ain't
[1:21:09] never seen him in her life. She's 16 and
[1:21:12] he's 40.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; I don't know how much he weighed. I
[1:21:18] don't know if he's pot belly, if he's
[1:21:19] skinny as a rail. I don't know if he is
[1:21:21] ugly, if he is cute. I don't have an
[1:21:23] idea. The Bible don't go into it none at
[1:21:26] all. But it must have been such a
[1:21:28] supernatural love that it was greater
[1:21:31] than the love she had for her mother. I
[1:21:34] wish somebody hear me tonight. If you
[1:21:37] don't love Jesus more than you love your
[1:21:40] mother or your father or your husband or
[1:21:43] your kid or your pastor or anybody else,
[1:21:47] you have an idol in your life.
[1:21:58] Yes, sir.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:22:02] She'll get over it. It's just a little
[1:22:06] excitement.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; She was over to that revival, you know.
[1:22:12] And then then that true servant said,
[1:22:14] "Don't worry us.
[1:22:17] Don't hinder me."
[1:22:20] A lot of the servants of God had been
[1:22:22] hindered
[1:22:24] by put off decisions.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Don't hinder me seeing that the Lord has
[1:22:33] sent me. Seeing that he's been good to
[1:22:34] me. Don't hinder me. Then they said,
[1:22:37] "Well, let her make her own decision."
[1:22:40] That's where you stand tonight. Make
[1:22:42] your own decision. And then they called
[1:22:44] Rebecca and said, "Will you go with this
[1:22:46] man
[1:22:48] or do you want to stay around a little
[1:22:51] while?" I want you to notice compromise
[1:22:53] how it works.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; They was not saying, "Oh, we're we
[1:22:59] thought he was moving here.
[1:23:02] There ain't no way. I mean, she ain't
[1:23:03] leaving our church.
[1:23:05] You mean you expect us to let her go
[1:23:07] there? Will you bring her back?" No.
[1:23:10] This is one way.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; No return ticket.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; You may never see her again.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Say goodbye and say how many ever you
[1:23:21] think you need because she may never
[1:23:23] come back again. And brother, sister, if
[1:23:26] you ever get her right, you'll never go
[1:23:28] back to that denomination. You'll never
[1:23:31] go back to the trash of the world.
[1:23:33] Hallelujah. If you ever get it right and
[1:23:35] get sealed in your soul by the Holy
[1:23:37] Ghost, the devil ain't got one thing in
[1:23:40] this world that could ever entice you or
[1:23:42] tempt you or pull you away from this
[1:23:45] love of the Lord Jesus Christ. Why?
[1:23:47] Because you have been smitten by him.
[1:24:02] And the prophet said, she said, "I
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; will go."
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Now, she wasn't in there, but the same
[1:24:12] spirit that was on that prophet
[1:24:14] messenger was on her. Amen.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; So the bride and the messenger is saying
[1:24:19] the same thing.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Now if he could have text Isaac or got
[1:24:23] him on on phone, you know what he'd been
[1:24:25] saying? Bring her on. Bring her on. So
[1:24:28] the bridegroom, the bride, and the
[1:24:29] messenger all three saying the same
[1:24:31] thing. Don't you let them handle her. If
[1:24:33] you picked her out, oh I I I can't wait
[1:24:36] to see her. I'm under such anticipation.
[1:24:38] Tell her to come on. Come on, honey.
[1:24:40] Come on. Don't you stay back down there
[1:24:42] with old lady and ain't nothing but a
[1:24:43] liar and a hypocrite. No way. You get
[1:24:45] out of there, your mama trying to hold
[1:24:46] you back in that old denomination. You
[1:24:48] imagine that all been saying the same
[1:24:50] thing cuz they're saying the same thing
[1:24:52] tonight. Come out from among them and be
[1:24:55] you a separate people, sayeth the Lord,
[1:24:57] and I will receive you unto myself.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Now you realize this same scenario is
[1:25:08] playing out worldwide
[1:25:10] again. Yeah,
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; people are being asked
[1:25:16] where you go
[1:25:18] and one by one each of us are making our
[1:25:22] decisions.
[1:25:24] Some start out and go part of the way as
[1:25:26] Lot's wife did. And she started out as
[1:25:29] an overcomer, but she didn't have it in
[1:25:32] her to go all the way.
[1:25:34] So, will you go
[1:25:39] if need be? Will you forsake your
[1:25:42] family?
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; I know for some people family is even
[1:25:47] more than God.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; All right. Come on.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, I could never. There's no way.
[1:25:54] There's no way. If you love him right,
[1:25:56] there's a way.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; I'm a just telling you something from
[1:26:01] good quotes. I know from experience
[1:26:02] myself. And I'll tell you one thing. If
[1:26:04] I had to do her again, I'd do her all
[1:26:06] over again.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; I know what it's like. Come on,
[1:26:09] somebody. Many of you know what it's
[1:26:10] like when your family think you're an
[1:26:12] absolute nut and they think you've gone
[1:26:14] off your mind and crazy as all get out.
[1:26:16] They don't even understand. You know,
[1:26:18] brother Donnie, you have any regrets?
[1:26:20] Yeah, I've got regrets. All right. My
[1:26:21] regrets are my mistakes. I've never
[1:26:23] regretted saying these words. I will go.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; I will go. But I guarantee you one
[1:26:31] thing. It's going to be a lot of people
[1:26:33] in hell that'll say, I wish I would have
[1:26:36] said that same thing. I wish I would
[1:26:39] have never said I cannot go.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; My mama won't speak to me. My daddy
[1:26:49] won't speak to me. My cousins, my
[1:26:51] brothers, my this and that and the
[1:26:52] other. I'll be laughed at, made fun of.
[1:26:55] What in the world will they do? I their
[1:26:57] sins.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; But if you ever meet the angel of God,
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. That's right.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Let's look at another view of this.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; I will go.
[1:27:12] Genesis 18:20.
[1:27:15] And the Lord said, because the cry of
[1:27:18] Sodom and Gomorrah is great, because
[1:27:21] their sin is very grievious,
[1:27:25] I will go.
[1:27:27] You see, there's sometimes that man
[1:27:29] makes a decision. There's other times
[1:27:31] God makes a decision. So here God has
[1:27:35] made a a a decision based on the
[1:27:38] condition of Sodom.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; And God made the decision to come down
[1:27:47] when Sodom was in such an increase.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Don't sit there and
[1:27:55] look at me like you don't know what I'm
[1:27:56] talking about. Lord have mercy. I
[1:27:58] believe our tri cities is getting worse
[1:28:00] and worse and worse with all these
[1:28:02] transgender stuff. It beats all I've
[1:28:04] ever seen in my life. Men wanting to
[1:28:07] become women. I seen one yesterday. I
[1:28:09] went to a drive-thru. It about made me
[1:28:11] sick to my stomach. Here come this guy
[1:28:14] and he his voice had already been
[1:28:15] changed and he talked like a girl, but
[1:28:17] he was definitely a boy. And you could
[1:28:20] tell he was a boy because he was trying
[1:28:22] to act too much like a girl. A girl is a
[1:28:25] real girl. Not because she puts on an
[1:28:27] act, but he was trying so hard to be a
[1:28:29] girl. It was evident that he wasn't a
[1:28:31] girl. A real Rebecca don't have to put
[1:28:34] on an act that I'm a Rebecca. She's a
[1:28:37] Rebecca. Well, hallelujah, by nature.
[1:28:40] And that's what we're seeing happen,
[1:28:42] friends, around this word. We've had a
[1:28:44] lot of actors around it. But the actors
[1:28:46] are getting cleaned out and getting out
[1:28:48] of our way. And what are we going to
[1:28:50] see? The real Rebecca. Well, the will.
[1:28:54] Rebecca, please stand up in this end
[1:28:57] time. Let your life shine. Let the
[1:28:59] manifestation of God live out of you.
[1:29:02] Rebecca, you don't have to put on. Be
[1:29:05] what you are.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; So God says, "I
[1:29:18] will go.
[1:29:25] He said the same thing in this day.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Now the time has come
[1:29:32] that we must recognize
[1:29:34] who's in our city today. Top to Kansas
[1:29:38] 1964.
[1:29:40] The time has come. We must recognize
[1:29:44] who's in our city today.
[1:29:47] The Lord Jesus himself.
[1:29:55] What happened? He must have said the
[1:29:57] same thing. I will go down
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; and I will bar the redeemed body of my
[1:30:06] prophet.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; I will have him to stand there and tell
[1:30:10] them their names, their addresses. I'll
[1:30:12] have him to tell them how many steps
[1:30:14] goes up to their house. You live on 321
[1:30:16] North Street. You went to a doctor. Kind
[1:30:19] of heavy. That guy had on glasses this
[1:30:20] and this and this and they're going to f
[1:30:22] they're going to faint. They're going to
[1:30:23] pass out. Oh my lord. We've never heard
[1:30:25] or seen things like this in our life.
[1:30:27] And the all the carnal ones that'll
[1:30:29] follow the message of thing. It's God.
[1:30:31] It's God. It was God but not the man. It
[1:30:34] was God in behind the veil. You said,
[1:30:35] "Brother Donnie, is that what you
[1:30:36] actually believe?" That's what I
[1:30:38] actually believe. I believe God come
[1:30:40] down and use that body. You said, "How
[1:30:42] could you ever say that?" Because I
[1:30:44] believe in a greater power of the cross
[1:30:46] than you do. You see, I believe the
[1:30:48] power of the cross is so great, it could
[1:30:50] cleanse a man born in sin like you and
[1:30:53] I. Not only did that blood, Hallelujah,
[1:30:56] that the Lord Jesus walked down here
[1:30:58] born of a virgin, but it released a
[1:31:00] cleansing power so powerful that it
[1:31:03] would be able to cleanse a blood that
[1:31:05] God could come down and borrow a
[1:31:07] prophet's body and say, "Now was what?
[1:31:09] He told you the truth.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; That was not my voice."
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:17] What about the one where he says it?
[1:31:20] This is not brother Brandham.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; This is I the Lord.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; He has surrendered his spirit to me.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you believe in that much
[1:31:30] power of the blood?
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Why would that stumble people? Because
[1:31:34] they don't believe. The power of the
[1:31:37] blood is such a powerful thing. Well,
[1:31:38] listen, friend. God is still speaking.
[1:31:40] He's still baring the bodies of pastors
[1:31:42] and the bodies of evangelists and
[1:31:44] teachers. and they get up and say things
[1:31:46] that you've talked about before you come
[1:31:48] to church.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; That ain't your pastor. That's not your
[1:31:52] evangelist. That's the Lord Jesus
[1:31:56] sending his spirit wide getting his
[1:31:58] Rebecca ready.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; So God said, I will go down and see
[1:32:09] whether they have done allto together
[1:32:11] according to the cry of it.
[1:32:15] which is come up unto me and if not I
[1:32:20] will know. Genesis 45:28. And Israel
[1:32:24] said, "It is enough.
[1:32:27] My son, oh glory, imagine Joseph, my
[1:32:31] son,
[1:32:32] is yet alive.
[1:32:35] I will go."
[1:32:38] It was no time for delay.
[1:32:42] It was no time. Well, I'm going to fast
[1:32:44] about it now. I don't know if I want to
[1:32:45] go down into Egypt or not. Now, ain't
[1:32:47] that awful worldly place down there? Oh,
[1:32:49] man. He had been away for him for about
[1:32:51] 20 years now. And he said, "My boys
[1:32:54] alive. Pack up the horses." Amen. You
[1:32:57] imagine when Joseph went down through
[1:32:58] there and his brothers come back. Ah,
[1:33:00] hallelujah. And they sent them wagons.
[1:33:02] According to the Bible, they sent wagons
[1:33:05] back to Jacob's camp. You imagine as he
[1:33:07] looked down the road and here come them
[1:33:09] bunch of wagons. He said, "What in the
[1:33:10] world is that? I ain't never seen
[1:33:12] nothing like that in my life. Here they
[1:33:14] come with Egyptian horses, Egyptian
[1:33:16] tapestry, Egyptian this, and Egyptian
[1:33:18] that. And they come back and said, "Your
[1:33:20] boy is alive." And he sent us down here
[1:33:23] to get you back. What was it? Under the
[1:33:25] sound of those chariot wheels once his
[1:33:28] deliverance. Hallelujah. And he was
[1:33:30] going to meet his son. Hallelujah to
[1:33:33] God. You imagine the spirit of God
[1:33:36] anointed him. He said, "I will go."
[1:33:41] Yes, I want to go. What about it? Where
[1:33:44] do we want to go? We want to go.
[1:33:57] God spoke to him.
[1:34:00] Genesis 46:4,
[1:34:02] I will go down
[1:34:06] with thee
[1:34:08] into Egypt.
[1:34:13] No wonder Jacob didn't have a hard time
[1:34:15] going down.
[1:34:19] If my God has told me that he will go
[1:34:22] with me through trials and hardships and
[1:34:25] difficulties,
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; by his grace, Brother Daryl, we'll face
[1:34:28] them. Amen.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; If your God tells you, "I will never
[1:34:34] leave you, I'll never forsake you."
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Now, he's saying this to you tonight. I
[1:34:40] will go with you. And he's waiting for
[1:34:43] your response.
[1:34:45] Then I will go with you.
[1:34:49] He wants you to say what he says
[1:34:53] about you.
[1:35:02] Exodus 32:30. And it came to pass on the
[1:35:06] mar that Moses said unto the people,
[1:35:08] "You have sinned, a great sin,
[1:35:11] and now I will go
[1:35:15] up unto the Lord per adventure. I shall
[1:35:19] make an atonement."
[1:35:21] You see, I will go affects so many
[1:35:24] things.
[1:35:25] It's not just good when things are rosy
[1:35:28] and things are fine. But sometimes
[1:35:31] servants of God have to say I will go
[1:35:34] and stand on your behalf. I will plead
[1:35:38] with father. I will petition with
[1:35:40] father.
[1:35:42] You see where prophets stood
[1:35:45] pre- crucifixion,
[1:35:48] precalvary,
[1:35:50] prophets
[1:35:52] became the mediator
[1:35:54] between God, hallelujah,
[1:35:58] and the people.
[1:36:00] God even said in the Old Testament, "If
[1:36:03] Daniel would hear, I would not hear his
[1:36:06] cry. If Jeremiah was here, I would not
[1:36:09] hear his prayer." Why would God say
[1:36:11] that? Because those men had such an
[1:36:14] impact on God's heart.
[1:36:20] Hallelujah.
[1:36:23] Hallelujah.
[1:36:26] Oh Lord, children, can you imagine
[1:36:28] standing before God
[1:36:30] when God had a seventh angel messenger
[1:36:32] that projected right from his right hand
[1:36:34] and people going to stand before God and
[1:36:36] and answer for calling him a false
[1:36:38] prophet and a liar and a deceiver and a
[1:36:41] trickster. Oh,
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; now I will go up into the Lord. Period.
[1:36:54] Venture. I shall make an atonement.
[1:36:59] You mean a prophet of God is going to
[1:37:02] presume. What is pursume? Venture
[1:37:04] without authority.
[1:37:08] But I love you all so much. He has not
[1:37:12] beckoned me to come into his presence.
[1:37:14] He has not beckoned me to come, but I
[1:37:18] will go.
[1:37:20] Well, I'm reminded of another I will go,
[1:37:23] little Esther. When she had not been
[1:37:25] beckoned by the king,
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; oh, hallelujah. that her heart was so
[1:37:30] moved. She said, "I will go
[1:37:34] and if the king will reach out as
[1:37:36] scepter to me, I'll live, but if not, I
[1:37:39] will die."
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Read with me in Ruth chapter 1:16. And
[1:37:44] Ruth said, "Entreat me not to leave thee
[1:37:48] or to return from following after thee,
[1:37:52] for whether thou goest, I will go.
[1:37:55] Whether thou lodest, where thou lodest,
[1:37:58] I will lodge. Thy people shall be my
[1:38:01] people, and thy Elohim
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; will be my Elohim.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; I will go.
[1:38:14] Don't you understand what this means to
[1:38:17] God? When his children, from all of
[1:38:20] their soul,
[1:38:22] this has happened in every age. When God
[1:38:24] sent Luther with a message, there was
[1:38:27] people that come out of that Catholic
[1:38:28] church and they said, "I will go."
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; Go where? With Luther.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; I will go with Wesley. I will go with
[1:38:40] tongues. I will go with interpretation
[1:38:42] in the early Pentecost. Then why should
[1:38:44] we be ridiculed that made fun of when
[1:38:47] we're saying the same thing our
[1:38:49] spiritual ancestors have said? I will
[1:38:52] go. I will go. Hinder me not.
[1:38:59] Yes, sir.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; David Psalm 66:13.
[1:39:05] I will go
[1:39:07] into thy house and turn on a tape. Oh,
[1:39:09] no. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a
[1:39:10] minute. I'm reading here from the modern
[1:39:12] day version here, the blasphemous
[1:39:13] version. I will go into thy house
[1:39:19] with burnt offerings.
[1:39:22] I will pay thee my vows. Psalm 71:16. I
[1:39:26] will go in the strength
[1:39:30] of the Lord God.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; If you don't get nothing else out of
[1:39:34] this service, I hope you get this one
[1:39:36] verse. I don't care what you're facing.
[1:39:40] But realize you're not going in your own
[1:39:41] strength. He's done said it. I will go
[1:39:44] with you. I will never leave you. I will
[1:39:47] never forsake you. He's waiting for your
[1:39:49] confession to match his. Remember the
[1:39:52] prophet said he's the high priest of our
[1:39:54] confession. He can only do for us in
[1:39:57] heaven what we say on earth he's doing.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Well, if you say he's forsaken me, he's
[1:40:02] not around me. He's not this. He cannot
[1:40:04] act on that confession. But he's saying
[1:40:07] I'll never leave you. I'll always be
[1:40:09] with you. I'll fight your battles. Hold
[1:40:11] your peace. Let me do it. What's he
[1:40:13] waiting for, brother Donio? You're
[1:40:15] waiting on him. Many times it ain't it
[1:40:17] ain't supposed to be that way. He's
[1:40:19] waiting on you
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; for your confession to match what he
[1:40:24] says about you. Well, I ain't no good.
[1:40:26] I'm low down. I'm rotten. I'm no cow.
[1:40:28] I'll never amount to nothing. Get that
[1:40:30] garbage out of your mouth.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:37] He called me and he knew what I was. He
[1:40:40] called me and he knew all my mistakes
[1:40:42] and he call me anyhow. He loves me with
[1:40:45] an everlasting love.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; He knows the thoughts that he thinks
[1:40:49] toward me, and they are good,
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; not evil.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; And I will go in the strength of the
[1:40:59] Lord God. I will make mention of thy
[1:41:02] righteousness, even of thine only. Psalm
[1:41:05] 118:19, "Open to me the gates of
[1:41:08] righteousness. I will go in into them
[1:41:11] and I will praise the Lord.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Friends, can't you see? So, here comes
[1:41:19] Rebecca. She wasn't in the meeting. Now,
[1:41:24] whenever the messenger and Tommy Osborne
[1:41:26] and all them was in the Chicago meeting
[1:41:31] and the spirit of God spoke to him, walk
[1:41:34] over there to that window.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; That's right. So he goes over to the
[1:41:38] window and he says, "They've got a trap
[1:41:40] laid for you."
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Well, Lord, if they've got that trap in
[1:41:45] that I I I don't want to go down there.
[1:41:47] I don't want to. You go. Don't fear.
[1:41:51] I'll be with you.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; So he told Brother Carl Williams, he
[1:41:55] said, "You watch this this certain
[1:41:57] color, brother. He'll be there. He'll be
[1:41:58] dressed in a certain thing. This man
[1:42:00] will be a certain thing. That man will
[1:42:01] be a certain thing." So the prophet
[1:42:03] walks right down there the next day and
[1:42:05] turns around and tell him, "I just
[1:42:07] described this and had these witnesses
[1:42:09] to stand up. Are you a witness? Did not
[1:42:11] I tell you this man to be sitting here
[1:42:13] that one, that one there?" Now he said,
[1:42:14] "This is what you've done.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; You've settled off the word and you talk
[1:42:19] around me behind my back. But if you
[1:42:21] can't take your Bible and prove me
[1:42:23] wrong, then get off my back."
[1:42:27] Glory.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Woo. Boy, Elijah was wrong, wasn't he?
[1:42:34] Hallelujah. And those men stood there
[1:42:36] and bore witness that God had told him
[1:42:39] why. God told him, "You go and I'll go."
[1:42:42] He said, "Well, if you're going, I'm
[1:42:43] going." God said, "Well, if you're
[1:42:44] going, I'm going." Well, God said,
[1:42:46] "Well, let's go on there."
[1:42:48] That's what he's wanting you and I to
[1:42:50] say. I'll go through these tests, Lord.
[1:42:53] I'll go through these trials. I'm going
[1:42:55] to come to church. I'm going to pray.
[1:42:56] I'm going to clap my hand. I don't care
[1:42:58] if I don't feel you for another three
[1:43:01] months. I'm still going to church. I'm
[1:43:03] going to put a smile on my face. I'm
[1:43:06] redeemed. I'm saved. I'm going to
[1:43:08] heaven. I'm the bride. God said, "Well,
[1:43:10] if you're going like that, I'm going
[1:43:11] with you."
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:21] Can't you see what she done?
[1:43:26] She characterized
[1:43:29] the faith
[1:43:31] of her future father-in-law
[1:43:36] before she ever met him.
[1:43:42] She was reflecting
[1:43:44] the faith of Abraham.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; I'm going to a land I've never seen. I'm
[1:43:52] going to marry a man I've never seen,
[1:43:55] but I believe it's good.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; I don't know what all of you can't you
[1:43:59] see why God looked at her and said she's
[1:44:02] definitely part of the family.
[1:44:05] You imagine Ellie said, "Yep, I've seen
[1:44:08] this before. I've seen this before." For
[1:44:12] 25 years, they laughed at him. They made
[1:44:14] fun of him. They've ridiculed him. And I
[1:44:16] see this this girl right here will fit
[1:44:18] into the family perfectly. Why? cuz she
[1:44:21] can be able to go to a land she ain't
[1:44:23] never seen before. Marry a man she ain't
[1:44:25] never seen before. Take the word of a
[1:44:28] messenger that she never saw before.
[1:44:31] Why? Face of Abraham
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; and she hadn't even met Abraham.
[1:44:49] so early the next morning.
[1:44:52] Now they're faced with this.
[1:44:57] But wasn't it something like that in the
[1:44:59] scripture that Abraham early the next
[1:45:01] morning
[1:45:03] when God told him about circumcision,
[1:45:06] early the next morning he arised to do
[1:45:09] it. So Rebecca early the next morning
[1:45:15] about the rising of the sun.
[1:45:20] Praise God.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, this was Rebecca's disposition
[1:45:28] of eternal life.
[1:45:33] Eternal
[1:45:35] life.
[1:45:39] Was she frightened, brother D? Probably.
[1:45:41] Just like we get. I don't know. I tell
[1:45:44] you, if I could fight all my battles
[1:45:46] feeling what I feel tonight,
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; I mean, it wouldn't even be halfway fair
[1:45:52] for the devil.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; But like you, I don't find mo fight most
[1:45:58] of my battles under the anointing. I
[1:46:00] fight them under faith with no feeling,
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; with no sensation. Come on, somebody.
[1:46:06] But you see the message had so stirred
[1:46:08] her heart and maybe she just responded I
[1:46:11] will go and what did I just say?
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; And her mama looked over at her brother
[1:46:16] looked over at her. Oh the customs of
[1:46:18] this was if the father or the brother
[1:46:21] which was the ruler of the entire house
[1:46:23] said you don't go you don't go.
[1:46:28] But something inside of her said,
[1:46:31] "Now honey, are you sure you want to go
[1:46:33] with this man?
[1:46:36] Now we've raised you in this hen house
[1:46:39] to be a good little chicken
[1:46:42] and you're nice and you're mannerly and
[1:46:45] you know we we don't know nothing about
[1:46:47] this man.
[1:46:48] It's a strange message. It seems very
[1:46:51] cultish as we've already told you before
[1:46:53] and all that and you know you'd make
[1:46:55] somebody some church of God man a really
[1:46:58] good pastor's wife I mean you'd make
[1:47:01] somebody here in Mesopotamia you know
[1:47:03] you maybe a merchant then probably she
[1:47:05] thought about her life and thought I'll
[1:47:07] probably just marry one of these guys
[1:47:08] whoever my daddy picks out for me and
[1:47:10] maybe be a sheep herder and I'll I'll
[1:47:13] just raise his kids and I I'll go to the
[1:47:15] market and buy flour and and do this
[1:47:17] that and the other and I'll probably
[1:47:22] never amount to nothing.
[1:47:25] Before she was ever born,
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; she was ordained
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; for a mighty purpose.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; And so were you.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Stand.
[1:47:54] Hallelujah.
[1:47:57] Oh my.
[1:47:59] Let me just uh
[1:48:01] share this with you, brothers. Let's
[1:48:03] let's come
[1:48:05] not sure exactly what uh what it'll be
[1:48:09] for you all as far as the page and that
[1:48:11] y'all will be on but I want to come past
[1:48:14] Genesis 24 56 whenever he said hinder me
[1:48:17] not and then question answer 64.
[1:48:22] Now brother Brandham
[1:48:24] is it true that no one should preach but
[1:48:29] you
[1:48:35] I don't know who this person was,
[1:48:38] but but man, this person, even if it's a
[1:48:40] sister, we're going to have a spell when
[1:48:42] we get to heaven.
[1:48:45] I'm so glad they asked this.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a reason.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Is it true that no one should preach but
[1:48:51] you? We have seen you ordain men, and we
[1:48:55] don't believe you would do that if they
[1:48:58] were not to preach.
[1:49:00] Now, Eleazar,
[1:49:02] tell me more.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Mercy.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Mercy.
[1:49:09] Brother, sister, ever. Who told you that
[1:49:12] nobody's to preach but me?
[1:49:15] I'd sure be a poor subject to God
[1:49:20] with all that.
[1:49:22] No.
[1:49:24] every man or that feels a call of God
[1:49:28] upon his life, get into the ministry and
[1:49:31] start pressing play and put me back in
[1:49:35] the pull pit and give up your
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; Well, that's what's being said today,
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; but it's not been said by
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; Eleazar.
[1:49:49] That's right.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; You understand this quote will condemn
[1:49:53] these so-called message people.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; And you know what it proves? They don't
[1:49:58] believe what he said.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; They only believe selectively.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Now notice, tell us, Ellie user, he had
[1:50:08] the opportunity to say it right here.
[1:50:11] Notice the year.
[1:50:13] Question answer 64.
[1:50:16] He had the opportunity to tell us. Now
[1:50:18] little children, I've come to bring
[1:50:21] something new,
[1:50:23] which is what all these people who
[1:50:25] believe in this tape only thing, that's
[1:50:27] what they believe. They do not believe
[1:50:30] Brother Brandham was sent to restore our
[1:50:33] faith back to the apostolic fathers.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; They believe he was sent to introduce
[1:50:38] something totally new,
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; and that is you stay home. So many of
[1:50:43] them don't even assemble anymore in
[1:50:45] church.
[1:50:46] They've got buildings sitting
[1:50:48] everywhere. It's hit Africa. It's hit
[1:50:50] India, the States, Canada.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; They don't even believe the Bible.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Paul said it thousands of years ago.
[1:51:00] Forsake not the assembling of yourselves
[1:51:03] together.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; And you see what it shows us, brother
[1:51:06] Daryl? because of the persecution
[1:51:08] against some of them Christians, they
[1:51:10] were staying out of church
[1:51:14] because of the risk of their life.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; God didn't even excuse that.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Now, can you imagine if God would anoint
[1:51:23] his servant Paul? Now, we'd think, well,
[1:51:26] if anybody would have a right to stay
[1:51:28] out of church, it'd be because, you
[1:51:30] know, there's cops standing outside.
[1:51:31] It's way worse than ICE. I mean, they're
[1:51:34] standing outside and they're they're
[1:51:35] going to get the preacher first and then
[1:51:37] they're going to get you guys and you
[1:51:38] and you women and your kids and I mean,
[1:51:40] they're going to I wonder how many would
[1:51:42] have tonight if we sent that out on a
[1:51:44] text
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; before service. Come on.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; So, people had started missing church
[1:51:53] and Paul told them, "Don't forsake the
[1:51:55] assembling of yourselves together. I
[1:51:57] know it's tough. I know it's risky." He
[1:52:00] said, "As the manner of some is." So
[1:52:02] already some of the first century
[1:52:04] Christians had started missing church
[1:52:08] and Paul said don't you do it. Brother
[1:52:09] Bram quotes the same thing in the breach
[1:52:11] and he said as the manner of unbelievers
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; is
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; talk to me Elazer
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; now you see when I press play this is
[1:52:26] some of the things I hear him say.
[1:52:29] So when I press play, what do you figure
[1:52:31] I'm supposed to do with this quote?
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Sit down.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; So here, Eleer is telling me, every
[1:52:38] other God call man. Men of God are
[1:52:41] anointed all over the world to
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; preach
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; the gospel. See, I'm just one little
[1:52:52] pebble on the beach
[1:52:57] among many big stones.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; That's a big man right there.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; See where he put himself
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; instead of some that's un in our ranks.
[1:53:08] And they'll let you know they're the big
[1:53:10] rock and you ain't even a little stone.
[1:53:12] You're just gravel dust.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; You're just gravel dust is all you are.
[1:53:16] You ought to be privileged. I mean, just
[1:53:18] to sit at the end of the pew where they
[1:53:20] sat or hand them a napkin or something
[1:53:22] like that. But here's a big man.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Here's a big man.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; There's many more eligible, more worthy,
[1:53:31] more anything to preach than me. I'm
[1:53:34] just one little humble person laying out
[1:53:36] here. I'm one grain of wheat and a whole
[1:53:40] garner.
[1:53:43] See, you know what I mean? Any man
[1:53:46] that's called of God
[1:53:48] needs to
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; preach the gospel.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; So then tell me, what spirit is on
[1:53:56] people that's trying to tell preachers
[1:53:59] to sit down?
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Antichrist.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; It's against the word.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; There's only two spirits.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Notice this one in question
[1:54:13] answer 61. But this message that I'm
[1:54:16] preaching, I love this quote, is the
[1:54:19] true message of God this day, and it's
[1:54:23] the last message. Now, you see what I'm
[1:54:26] doing, brethren? This is a question
[1:54:27] answers with the ministers and the men
[1:54:29] of the church there in Jeffersonville.
[1:54:31] You see what I'm doing, brethren? I'm
[1:54:34] putting you all at the same place I am,
[1:54:38] cuz you're just as much into it as I am.
[1:54:43] You are messengers.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Now, who am I supposed to believe
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; this one?
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Or somebody that says the exact
[1:54:58] opposite.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Now, you can get on that camel if you
[1:55:03] wish to. I'm not sure where you'll wind
[1:55:06] up. Well, actually, I am.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Tribulation period. Unless these people
[1:55:10] get converted and get this evil thing
[1:55:12] off of them, there won't be a one of
[1:55:13] them in the rapture.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; It can't be.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Does it make any difference to God which
[1:55:18] scripture you deny? Malachi 4 or
[1:55:21] Ephesians 4.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Friends that don't even believe what the
[1:55:27] prophet of God taught.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:55:33] Now, this is what her brother and mother
[1:55:35] said. And they said, "We will call the
[1:55:37] damsel and inquire at her mouth."
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; So they bring her in.
[1:55:47] Rebecca,
[1:55:49] this man says that he is a messenger
[1:55:53] from Abraham.
[1:55:56] This man says that he has a son. We
[1:55:59] don't even know if he has a son. He says
[1:56:02] he's rich. I mean, he's got a lot of
[1:56:03] stuff here with him, but we don't know
[1:56:04] that he might not have stolen it cuz
[1:56:06] there's something sneaking about this
[1:56:08] man. You know, we can't really prove all
[1:56:09] of his tales and stories and stuff.
[1:56:14] Can anybody in this building tonight
[1:56:16] scientifically prove to me that Moses
[1:56:19] was actually on the mountain and the
[1:56:21] finger of God wrote in rock the Ten
[1:56:25] Commandments?
[1:56:31] But how many of you people believe that
[1:56:33] happened?
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; Really?
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Based on what proof
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; and were there 385,913
[1:56:44] people that saw it, saw God write it?
[1:56:47] How many people were there?
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; One.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; And you people believe that?
[1:56:57] Y'all a bunch of nuts, you know.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; But aren't you glad if you're a nut,
[1:57:02] you're threaded to the right bolts?
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Where he leads
[1:57:18] me, I
[1:57:21] will follow.
[1:57:24] Where he leads
[1:57:28] me, I
[1:57:31] will follow.
[1:57:35] Where he leads,
[1:57:39] the bride
[1:57:41] will follow.
[1:57:46] I'll go with him.
[1:57:51] With him.
[1:57:54] all
[1:57:57] the way.
[1:58:02] Lord Jesus, as we bow our heads tonight,
[1:58:04] Father,
[1:58:06] we are so thankful of your great mercy
[1:58:09] and love to us.
[1:58:12] We're so grateful, Father, that we don't
[1:58:14] have to have it all scientifically
[1:58:15] proven, and it don't have to come in 14
[1:58:18] different manuals. it's been authorized
[1:58:20] by this person and they've spot checked
[1:58:23] it and it's been through Wikipedia and
[1:58:25] it's come through this and that and that
[1:58:27] and that and that.
[1:58:29] We're so grateful, Lord, we can believe
[1:58:33] without all of that.
[1:58:35] As Carol and I stood a few years ago and
[1:58:38] Cesaria and the guide there pointed out
[1:58:42] a big stone and it was a replica of
[1:58:45] course,
[1:58:48] but he said that scholars and historians
[1:58:53] had said for hundreds and hundreds of
[1:58:55] years that Pontius Pilate
[1:58:59] was not even a real person.
[1:59:02] So therefore, the Bible when it
[1:59:05] mentioned his name, it proved that the
[1:59:07] Bible was wrong
[1:59:09] because they had not found any Roman
[1:59:12] documents
[1:59:14] stating Pontius Pilate ever worked for
[1:59:17] the federal government.
[1:59:21] But they was in there digging around
[1:59:24] some archaeologists and they found a
[1:59:26] stone in there, a big massive stone
[1:59:29] turned upside down that had been laying
[1:59:33] there for hundreds of years
[1:59:37] and it had Pontius Pilot's name on the
[1:59:40] stone
[1:59:42] laying there buried under rubble of sand
[1:59:44] and dust.
[1:59:46] So them men spent their entire life for
[1:59:50] men dedicated years of their life trying
[1:59:53] to prove disprove that one point that
[1:59:56] pilot never lived.
[2:00:00] So in reality their life was in vain
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; because now thousands times thousands of
[2:00:09] people walk by and look at this
[2:00:13] stone which is made in an exact image of
[2:00:15] the real
[2:00:17] this certain certain place built and
[2:00:19] dedicated to and Pontius Pilot's name
[2:00:22] right on the bottom of it.
[2:00:25] So will it be one day
[2:00:28] all of those who preached and promoted
[2:00:31] atheism, preached and promoted Darwin
[2:00:35] and his theory,
[2:00:38] when they walk up before the great
[2:00:40] throne of God, it will not be Darwin
[2:00:43] that will see, but the great creator of
[2:00:47] the universe.
[2:00:50] So they've lived their entire life in
[2:00:54] vain.
[2:00:56] As I said and listened on YouTube the
[2:00:59] other day, one day this week to a
[2:01:02] scientist
[2:01:04] who was an atheist,
[2:01:07] but yet he went to hear a speaker and
[2:01:09] the man was a he was a preacher but a
[2:01:13] very smart man. And he really resented
[2:01:16] the things he had to say. But the man
[2:01:18] was also a scientist of sorts and he he
[2:01:20] just kind of wanted to really debate
[2:01:22] with the guy and argue with him.
[2:01:24] But the man laid out the gospel in such
[2:01:26] a way that scientist
[2:01:29] felt under conviction there in that
[2:01:31] seminar thing and the spirit of God
[2:01:35] moved in that place and moved on his
[2:01:37] heart and he found himself asking you to
[2:01:41] forgive his sins
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; and now he's become one of the main
[2:01:46] vocal scientists in the creationist
[2:01:49] theory. So now he travels all over the
[2:01:52] world and he takes fish and all types of
[2:01:56] different things and proves hallelujah
[2:01:59] that this fish could not exist without a
[2:02:01] creator
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; designing it.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; And he studies all these great
[2:02:06] scientific terms and this and that and
[2:02:08] the other. One of the things that he was
[2:02:10] dealing with was a certain octopus
[2:02:13] and it can mimic all these different
[2:02:15] creatures of the sea. A little bitty old
[2:02:18] tiny thing. It can change its color. It
[2:02:20] can change its texture.
[2:02:23] It's not taught how to do it.
[2:02:26] But somehow when it gets in certain
[2:02:28] environment, it'll look like a snake.
[2:02:30] Then it gets in another environment,
[2:02:32] it'll look like a fish. And then it'll
[2:02:34] change itself to look like this and like
[2:02:36] that and like that.
[2:02:40] And he said there's only one way that it
[2:02:43] could do that because a great designer
[2:02:46] gave it the ability to do so because
[2:02:49] they're not taught it by their mother or
[2:02:51] their father.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; So he said it must be in their DNA.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Thank you, Lord.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; So, it's in our spiritual DNA
[2:03:05] to believe you when things look
[2:03:08] impossible.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; It was in Rebecca's DNA to respond, "I
[2:03:16] will go."
[2:03:19] She was going to find out she was going
[2:03:21] to fit in this family perfectly well.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah to God.
[2:03:28] Oh Jesus, I'm so glad that I fit
[2:03:32] with the family of God.
[2:03:35] Oh, we have our human differences and
[2:03:37] our human makeup and we clash on this
[2:03:39] and that and the other, but there's one
[2:03:41] thing about it. I sure don't fit in the
[2:03:43] world. I sure don't fit in a
[2:03:45] denominational system. There's only one
[2:03:48] place I fit in the family of God.
[2:03:53] I love the thrill that I feel when I get
[2:03:57] together
[2:03:58] with God's wonderful people.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, I shared the quote this evening with
[2:04:05] some preachers or brother Brandham
[2:04:07] talked about going to the house of God
[2:04:09] and just being there in that presence
[2:04:12] and what it done to you and how it made
[2:04:14] you feel. And oh, I just read it and I
[2:04:16] thought, praise God. I shared it with
[2:04:18] Carol. I said, "This is one of the
[2:04:20] reasons why we love to go to church."
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; And the prophet just described what it
[2:04:26] did to him and how it made him feel
[2:04:28] because we are with our real family.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; We love you tonight, Lord Jesus.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; We worship you, Father. Hallelujah.
[2:04:39] Hallelujah.
[2:04:41] We thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:04:44] Thank you, Lord Jesus. If it's this
[2:04:47] good, friends, now when we can come
[2:04:50] together in the house of God, what will
[2:04:53] it be when we get over yonder?
[2:04:57] Can you sing that for us?
[2:05:01] Praise be to God. Let's worship a little
[2:05:04] before we go. We've only got a few more
[2:05:06] Wednesdays before school is going to
[2:05:08] start. So, let's take advantage of them,
[2:05:10] shall we?
[2:05:12] Oh, praise the Lord.
[2:05:16] Thank you Lord.
[2:05:19] A country where
[2:05:22] no twilight shadows
[2:05:25] deeper.
[2:05:30] Unending day where night will never
[2:05:36] be
[2:05:39] dark.
[2:05:40] It's a city where no storm clouds ever
[2:05:46] again.
[2:05:49] Thank you, Jesus. Oh, this is just what
[2:05:54] heaven means to me.
[2:06:01] What will it be when we get over the
[2:06:11] and join the throne upon the glass
[2:06:16] se
[2:06:21] where meet our love ones and crown
[2:06:25] Christ forever.
[2:06:30] Oh, this is just what heaven means
[2:06:36] to me.
[2:06:40] And when at last we see the face of
[2:06:46] Jesus
[2:06:51] before whose image of the loves all
[2:06:56] flee.
[2:07:00] And when we crown him, Lord of all, I
[2:07:06] want to be there.
[2:07:10] Cuz this is just what heaven means
[2:07:16] to me.
[2:07:20] What will it be when we get over yonder
[2:07:30] and join the throne upon the glassy sea
[2:07:40] will meet our love
[2:07:43] and crown Christ forever.
[2:07:50] Oh, this is just what heaven means
[2:07:55] to me.
[2:08:00] A country where no twilight
[2:08:05] shadows deeper.
[2:08:10] unending day where night will never be.
[2:08:19] It's a city where no storm clouds ever
[2:08:25] gather.
[2:08:29] Oh, this is just what heaven means
[2:08:35] to me.
[2:08:39] How will it be when we get over yonder
[2:08:49] and join the throne upon the glassy sea.
[2:08:59] We'll meet our love ones and crown
[2:09:04] Christ forever.
[2:09:09] Oh, this is just what heaven means
[2:09:14] to me.
[2:09:17] Oh, what will it be when we get over
[2:09:24] yonder?
[2:09:29] Join the throngs upon the glassy sea.
[2:09:38] will meet our loved ones and crown
[2:09:42] Christ forever.
[2:09:48] Oh, this is just what heaven means
[2:09:53] to me.
[2:09:57] We'll meet our loved ones and crown
[2:10:02] Christ forever.
[2:10:07] Oh, this is just what heaven means
[2:10:13] to me.
[2:10:28] We've said I will go and we won't go
[2:10:30] back.
[2:10:32] I've been changed.
[2:10:37] Heal,
[2:10:41] free,
[2:10:45] delivered.
[2:10:48] I found joy,
[2:10:53] peace,
[2:10:57] grace,
[2:11:00] and favor.
[2:11:03] And right now
[2:11:07] is the moment.
[2:11:11] Today
[2:11:15] I've been changed.
[2:11:19] I have waited
[2:11:23] for this moment to come. And I won't let
[2:11:28] it pass me by.
[2:11:35] I won't go back. I can't go back to the
[2:11:40] way it used to be before your presence
[2:11:45] came and changed me. We say I won't go
[2:11:52] back. I can't go back to the way it used
[2:11:57] to be before your presence came and
[2:12:02] changed me. We say I won't go back. I
[2:12:08] can't go back to the way it used to be
[2:12:14] before your presence came and changed
[2:12:18] me.
[2:12:20] I've been shamed
[2:12:24] here
[2:12:28] free.
[2:12:31] Delivered.
[2:12:34] I found your
[2:12:39] peace,
[2:12:43] grace,
[2:12:46] and favor.
[2:12:49] And right now
[2:12:53] is the moment.
[2:12:55] Today is the day I've been changed.
[2:13:02] I've been changed. And I'm waiting
[2:13:07] for this moment to come. And I want it
[2:13:16] back.
[2:13:19] Hallelujah. I say I won't go back. I
[2:13:23] can't go back to the way it used to be
[2:13:28] before your presence came and changed
[2:13:32] me. We say I won't go back. I can't go
[2:13:39] back to the way it used to be. For your
[2:13:44] presence came and changed me.
[2:13:49] all my shame.
[2:13:56] All my sins
[2:14:00] they are forgiven.
[2:14:04] No change,
[2:14:08] fear.
[2:14:12] my past.
[2:14:15] It's over.
[2:14:18] And right now
[2:14:22] some more
[2:14:24] today.
[2:14:27] I've been changed.
[2:14:31] I've been changed. And I'm waiting.
[2:14:36] Glory for this moment to come. I've been
[2:14:41] wait I'll be waiting for
[2:14:45] I'm not going to let it pass me by.
[2:14:49] I won't go back. Can't go back to the
[2:14:54] way it used to be before your presence
[2:14:59] came to change.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. Just say I want to go back.
[2:15:07] I can't go back. I ain't got no place to
[2:15:10] go back to. I've burned all the bridges.
[2:15:13] I've burned all the ships. I ain't going
[2:15:15] back to the world. I'm a back
[2:15:19] going back to the dark of the world. I
[2:15:22] can't go back.
[2:15:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:15:27] Before your presence came,
[2:15:31] Lord,
[2:15:33] I've been changed. Oh, yes, I have.
[2:15:37] feel
[2:15:41] free.
[2:15:44] I've been delivered.
[2:15:46] I delivered.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; I found joy.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, aren't you glad you found joy?
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; His peace,
[2:15:55] grace, grace,
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; and my father and heaven and earth.
[2:16:02] And right now, right now.
[2:16:06] Hallelujah.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Jesus.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; Today is the day.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; Why wait till Wednesday? Why wait till
[2:16:15] next Sunday? Clean your victory tonight.
[2:16:19] Hallelujah. Jesus said, "I'll go down
[2:16:22] and die for him." Say, "I'm going to get
[2:16:24] my salvation." Jesus said, "I'll be for
[2:16:27] him. I'm coming to get my head.
[2:16:31] I
[2:16:34] won't go back. I can't go. I can't go
[2:16:37] back.
[2:16:39] I used to be before your presence came.
[2:16:50] I can't go back to the way it used to
[2:16:55] be. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:16:58] came and changed me. Oh, I won't go
[2:17:04] back. I can't go back to the way I used
[2:17:09] to be.
[2:17:11] Your presence came and changed me.
[2:17:17] Maybe about a week out. It was 120 in
[2:17:21] the shade. They're having to watch the
[2:17:23] water supply. They can't wait to find an
[2:17:26] oasis. She's burning up, wiping sweat,
[2:17:30] man. I love Oh, goodness. And the devil
[2:17:33] coming up. Oh, girl, you've done it now.
[2:17:36] I wonder what she's saying. Well, she'd
[2:17:38] probably love this song right here
[2:17:40] tonight. I can't go back. I won't go
[2:17:44] back. I never go back and be what I was
[2:17:47] before. Why? Because the presence of the
[2:17:51] angel changed me. Hallelujah.
[2:17:55] Hallelujah. What about it, Rebecca? Are
[2:17:57] you wanting to go back? Are you want to
[2:17:59] go back to them old bonds of sin and
[2:18:02] that unbelief that we were in? Don't
[2:18:04] take me back. Take me on higher. Don't
[2:18:07] take me back. Take me on up in the
[2:18:09] presence of God. Sing it. Oh, let's
[2:18:12] praise the Lord tonight.
[2:18:15] Together
[2:18:17] used to be
[2:18:20] that presence came and changed me.
[2:18:24] Changed me. Oh, I won't go back. I can't
[2:18:29] go back to the way I used to be. Before
[2:18:34] your presence came and changed, change
[2:18:40] all my shame.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; All my guil
[2:18:49] and all my sins,
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; they've been forgiven.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; They've been forgiven. And not only
[2:18:54] that, the door shaking
[2:18:58] Jesus
[2:18:59] feel
[2:19:05] my
[2:19:07] is over.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; Waited
[2:19:13] for this moment to come and I won't let
[2:19:19] it pass. Let it pass me by.
[2:19:25] I won't go back. I can't go back to the
[2:19:31] way it used to be. The way it used to
[2:19:33] be. Your presence came and changed me.
[2:19:39] We said I won't go back. Oh, I can't go
[2:19:44] back to the way
[2:19:47] to be before your presence came and
[2:19:51] changed me.
[2:19:56] Oh, yes, you did. Lord, you changed
[2:20:00] me.
[2:20:03] Brother Daryl, come close the service by
[2:20:06] you.
[2:20:08] Praise the Lord.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:20:12] I might be preaching on uh
[2:20:16] I guess we'll have to see Sunday, won't
[2:20:18] we?
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; I'll give you a little hint, though.
[2:20:22] I'll be preaching on the platform.
[2:20:35] Well,
[2:20:36] I'm leaving Friday for Wisconsin, so
[2:20:40] we'll certainly be praying for you
[2:20:41] folks.
[2:20:43] Have you enjoyed the word of God
[2:20:44] tonight?
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:51] You know, I was thinking there in
[2:20:53] Genesis 24:57 when it said, "The damsel
[2:20:56] has a mouth, let her speak." And so
[2:21:00] just before she went,
[2:21:03] she had a voice.
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The prophet of God said
[2:21:08] under her messenger, she will be the
[2:21:11] final voice to the final age.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad tonight to be a
[2:21:17] part of the economy of God? Amen.
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother Donnie, so much
[2:21:21] for telling us the truth.
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow our heads.
[2:21:31] Heavenly Father, it's just
[2:21:36] in your presence, Lord. Just
[2:21:42] we hear these things
[2:21:45] spoken
[2:21:46] has been led in the word
[2:21:49] and it becomes so real, so fresh,
[2:21:53] so personal. Lord,
[2:21:56] we are so grateful, dear God, and
[2:21:59] that the Bible is not a
[2:22:04] it's not a book, oh God, of
[2:22:07] of of an intellectual conception, but
[2:22:10] it's
[2:22:12] when you look at it, it's a love letter
[2:22:14] to your people, Lord.
[2:22:17] at the mind, the mysteries and the
[2:22:19] secrets that was in your mind
[2:22:22] has now been placed in the hearts of the
[2:22:24] believers. John took the book, Lord, and
[2:22:26] he ate it. And him and the book become
[2:22:28] one. God, we're so grateful, Lord, that
[2:22:31] we see oursel in these scriptures, dear
[2:22:32] God, that's laying there, Lord, as as
[2:22:36] the story unfolds,
[2:22:38] we see ourselves, God. And we're so
[2:22:40] grateful for that, Lord.
[2:22:43] May you go with your people now, dear
[2:22:45] God, make the way home. Watch over them,
[2:22:47] Lord. Give them traveling grace.
[2:22:50] And Lord, those that are among us, dear
[2:22:52] God, that are sick and afflicted,
[2:22:56] oh Lord, we're so grateful that you're
[2:22:58] our healer. And may you move, dear God,
[2:23:00] up on these needs. We pray
[2:23:03] Lord as our precious pastor brought out
[2:23:06] Father God that
[2:23:09] you never said Lord that we wouldn't
[2:23:10] have trials or we wouldn't go through
[2:23:12] valleys or dark places
[2:23:15] but you did promise us dear God that we
[2:23:16] would not go alone.
[2:23:19] We're grateful for that Lord. Thank you
[2:23:21] for the word of God we heard tonight.
[2:23:23] And thank you, dear God, that we can
[2:23:25] come and set, Lord, and at your table
[2:23:29] and feast on the revealed word of the
[2:23:30] hour. Bless brother Donnie, Lord, renew
[2:23:33] his strength, Father, we pray.
[2:23:37] Strengthen your people, Lord, and
[2:23:38] prepare us for the journey that lays
[2:23:40] just ahead. And Father, may we never go
[2:23:43] back,
[2:23:46] but may we always go forward as you
[2:23:48] reveal yourself to us in a greater way.
[2:23:51] Bless your people now, Lord. Lord, we
[2:23:53] pray
[2:23:54] for we ask these things in Jesus' name.
[2:23:57] And the bride says,
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; God bless you, saint. You're dismissing
[2:24:01] the fear of the Lord. Remember the
[2:24:03] service Sunday morning, 11:00. We pray
[2:24:05] for our pastor. Amen. Ain't it been good
[2:24:08] to be in the house of God.
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Aren't you glad you're
[2:24:13] on this journey?
[2:24:20] Amen.
[2:24:22] Sing this up, brother. Whatever you want
[2:24:23] me.
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; I won't go back. I can't go back to the
[2:24:32] way it used to be. Oh, your presence
[2:24:37] came and changed me.
[2:24:42] Oh, I won't go back. Can't go back to
[2:24:48] the way it used to be before your
[2:24:52] presence came and chang.
[2:24:57] Oh, I won't go back. I can't go back to
[2:25:03] the way it used to be before your
[2:25:07] friends came and changed.
[2:25:12] Oh, I won't go back. I can't go back to
[2:25:18] the way.
[2:25:58] I've been changed.
[2:26:06] Free
[2:26:10] deliver.
[2:26:13] I found.
