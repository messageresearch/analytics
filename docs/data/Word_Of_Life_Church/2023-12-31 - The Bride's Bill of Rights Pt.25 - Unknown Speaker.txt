the blood was presented that covered my sin I was forgiven when mercy W [Music] [Applause] in I'm so glad that I know today that Mercy is a person it's not just a subject matter that's nice to discuss but he's a real living person want you glad you know him in that way today if we ever really learn to know him Beyond just going to church and Beyond picking up a Bible and reading it occasionally and singing a few religious songs but we know him and that his life actually enters into us and we become the expression of eternal life then we will move beyond the knowledge of John 3:16 then we will actually start moving into an understanding of First John 3:16 let's read about it today shall we let's start off with 1 John chapter 4 verse 16 this morning greet you in the name of the lord it's a great privilege for us to be together in in the house of God and where we can come together and worship and sing and pray and hear prayer requests and hear testimonies and then the breaking of the bread of life to be able to understand the hour that we're living that we can have a greater your understanding of the Lord for many people going to church it's like they enter into kindergarten and they never really go beyond the preaching of the Cross and the preaching of Heaven and the preaching of hell but whenever I went to school that's been along many years ago of course but whenever I went to school if they would have still been teaching me the same thing in the 10th grade that I learned in the first grade I would figure there's something bad wrong somewhere well if that's just so with education then what about an understanding about God I want to know more than just that he came to the world to save me I know that already okay I'm 67 years old I've been s saved since I was 12 been preaching since I was 18 so I want to know more than that God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son I believe that I've experienced that but I want to know know also more that there's a heaven to gain as we say and a hell to shine I've known that since I was a little bitty guy I want to know more and I want to experience more you see the Greeks whenever they took the word for knowledge they used it in the form of nosis but for the Hebrews whenever they talked about knowledge to them it was more than what you knew up here it was something that you knew by experience so you actually had experienced something and you furthered your knowledge by what you had experienced that's what I believe true Christianity is now notice John 1 John 4:1 16 remember he was referred to as the Apostle of love so he had a depth and a degree of love that uh some of the other Apostles actually never did actually have which lets us know that there will be be people in Christianity Today that can actually experience a greater love than others can notice how John says this and we have known and believed now again he uses the word known as an experience so it's not like that they knew it just up here we have known and believed and the Greek word is soo which is Faith to be able to touch God for what you have needed we have known and believe the love that God hath sent or hath to us God is say it with me God is love God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God I want you to notice how that John places this so a person doesn't just experience the love of God God Saves them God pardons them of their sin and then they go right back to the same life that come out out of and start dwelling in the same stuff again but John puts a differentiation between those who just come to a saving knowledge of the Lord and those that move into the sphere of love into the Land of Love he that dwelleth look at the meaning of the word Greek word Mino abide remain continue to remain not to depart to continue to be present not to be become another or different so a person then moves into the land of love which is eternal life he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him so God is love and to live in fellowship with him is to live in God he who then is Love full of the love of God will also love his brother he will hate no man he that hateth his brother is in darkness and no light is in him at all how many believes we all need more of the love of God Amen and we'd like to be remembered today as we pray Brother Lou did you mention about brother Bill being in the hospital okay all right we want to remember brother Bill Yan brother Jack and text me this morning said that brother Bill was in the hospital or in the ER vomiting up blood so we certainly want to remember our brother today um if you have a need and request you just hold it in your heart let's just bow our heads in the presence of God Heavenly Father we certainly appreciate your grace to us today I pray Lord that you would open up this realm of fear also the realm of love to us we know that John said he that fearth is not made perfect in love so may we be able to see this realm of fear that we're all born in and see that it is one of captivity one of limitation that will never allow us to be what you want us to be if we don't somehow move out of that land of fear where it controls us every day every night Lord God if we could move from the land of fear today into the land of your all consuming love what people we would become that's our desire we ask you father that you'd be mindful of the sick and needy you see Lord this handkerchief that I have in my hands we know according to the Bible that they took cloths from the body of Paul and people were healed and demons went out of them people were set free I'm certainly not him of course but you're still the same Jesus so I'm going to preach with this Prayer cross today in my pocket for sister Lona you see Lord the sickness and things she's been dealing with Satan in the name of Jesus iure you by the Living God come away from our sister may every attribute of this leave her body in the name of Jesus Christ father May the presence of God come here today may you take charge of this service May every thought be brought into obedience to Christ may not only the master of the wind but may you be the master of this service today help me that I can get out of the way and surrender myself that you can speak through me Father for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it and the Saints said amen amen God bless you you may be seated we know that God is the highest and the purest form of love and yet there's all different degrees of love it becomes so low it can become filthy ungodly perverted Twisted but the highest form is our father truly he wanted to express what he was and he started doing it in the beginning John goes a little further in the advancement of the beginning than what Moses was allowed to right when God began to express himself and Moses says that God in the beginning created the heavens and the Earth but then we wonder but what was before the beginning it's clear to see from Genesis one that Moses did not catch it before it was the element of time but John was able in John 1:1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the same as in the beginning with God and he goes on to express to us what the word really was and then verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the Old Testament could never be able to convey the real true person of God because the law limited that expression of what God was so what they knew God was was in the manner of Thou shalt and thou shalt not and thou shout and thou shalt not the prophets were the justice of God so God would send them and they'd say thus sayeth the Lord this is going to happen to you and that's going to happen to you if you don't straighten up God's going to send you to Babylon if you don't do this God's going to get you and this is going to happen they could never really be able to understand the love of God the law limited the expression of it Moses saw him one day when he was set in the Cliff of The Rock and God said you cannot see my face no man can see my face and live but there is a place by me and I will set you in the Cliff of The Rock and when I pass by I will move my hand and then you'll be able to see a little bit of my glory but you can't see me so the mystery of God was kept hidden plumb up into the New Testament until one day a baby was born a virgin according to Isaiah would conceive and bring forth a child his name Shall be Called counselor Prince of Peace the Mighty God the Everlasting father and of his government there shall be no end to it people looked at him and thought he looked just like any ordinary baby cried like a baby had to have his diaper changed like another baby he would cry whenever he'd get hungry no doubt as a little boy as he learn how to walk he would fall and bump his head and Mary would run over to him and that would be little Jesus with a little pump knot on his head and she he'd cry and Mary would pick him up hold him in her arms look like a baby baby cried like a 2-year-old looked like a 4-year-old acted like a six-year-old but when he got up to 12 they noticed there was a difference in him they found him in the temple and he was actually expounding on the law and confounding the doctors of the law now many of them men were 50 60 70 80 90 years old they given their entire life studying the Torah of God here was a 12-year-old boy that was asking them questions and answering their questions a 12-year-old boy which had just recently of course come through his bar mitzvah which meant that he was allowed the first time to read the Torah and hold it himself the first time so he read that and he had this understanding they they couldn't understand it at all how could a 12-year-old boy which just now started reading the Torah be able to answer such questions and ask us such questions that we can't even answer ourself now no doubt they were very impressed because they were men of the Mind instead of men of the heart you know we find them two categories the same today there are people of the mind and people of the heart the people of the mind they're the ones that tend to lead toward you know great degrees in college and great understanding about this there's that way the same way in religion that there will be people and they wouldn't dare go to a church unless the pastor of course had a a Bachelor of Arts and maybe a master's degree and a degree in Theology and a degree in this and that and the other and he would stand and he went through preacher school he knew exactly how to fold his hands and make all fingers go together he was so neat and so prim and proper um naturally that don't go along with who we are because we're the acts two type of people and I'm afraid neither Peter James par balamu Andrew none of the rest of the Apostles none of them ever graduated from Bible school but they did graduate from the school of iology and the school of the baptism of the Holy Ghost so that's the kind of church we are now but God wanted to be able to convey something that man had been so far away from since his fall in the Garden of Eden and that was the perception of the depths of the love of God what God was so if God is love what does that mean so God God just lets everybody do whatever they want to do because that's the modern rendition of what people think Love Is Well if you love people you just let them do whatever they want to do and nobody corrects nobody you know because that's the age we're living in in our woke society that you can't say anything that hurts anybody's feelings well the truth of it is if you're going to tell the truth you're going to hurt almost everybody and some people want the truth and most don't but there's no way you're going to be able to really stand with god without hurting somebody's feelings is that right so God wanted people to be able to not only know him by love as far as picking up his word and being able to read it but he wanted them to be able to experience this type of Love Now watch again 1 John 4:17 how that John says herein is our love made perfect I want you to notice how he differentiates this between the love of God and our love so he calls this our love herein is our love made perfect now we looked at the word already the Greek word which is Tios and it does not mean that it is Flawless without fault but it is perfect here is of mature age it's grownup love so it's love to where that it has been brought through tests and trials and storms and things of life now John said herein is our love made perfect so it wasn't given to us whenever we receive the spirit of God our love was not given to us in the perfect format or the complete mature format started out really really green really really immature really incomplete in itself yet it was in seed form so everything that it could ever be laid in the potential so say I would hand you an acorn well it depends on how you look at that acor now if you look at it just in the form that it is you say what could I ever do with that well you could give it to a squirrel and a squirrel could eat it for breakfast and for lunch and that would probably be as far as it would go or you could plant it in the ground and then out of that one would come many many more acrn they would fall to the ground the squirrels would get them bury them they only recall around 60 some per of where they bury them so what God did that by Nature so that they would help plant the forest again so then they will come up out of that will come another out of that will come another and before long you have got a whole big Forest there of either Red Oaks pin oaks White Oaks black Oaks and who was the one who planted them there they come from the sea so it's the same way with our love when we receive the spirit of God we receive this little thing about the size of a button so whenever that button comes inside of us it's so immature it's so green it's so ignorant yetep it's truly the love of God and it starts growing and it gets bigger and bigger and the more that it can grow the more of God can be Express in our life now I'm not sure exactly where you are today maybe some of you about the size of this lid maybe some of you is the size of the bottle some of you may be the size of the pull pit probably some of you think you're as big as the whole wide world I kind of doubt that but maybe that's what you think you are but it continues to grow you say when does it stop it doesn't stop until you're finished in this life and once you get up to that spot then you've reached that place that God and if you'll notice the way God takes his children from the earth some may mature at the age of 40 the work is done he'll pull them from the earth Others May Live to 60 or 65 or even 70 it might take them an extra 20 years to be able to come up to what God wants them to be once they R them they mature they could grow no farther if they lived here another 150 years he will he will take them in the Harvest cycle into the sixth Dimension and there they will Embrace their theophany some may go while they're yet in their teens but each one of us will reach our spiritual growth in God in different levels that's what makes the Rapture such an awesome thing because on the earth there will be a group of people all over the entire Earth and they will be maturing along in the same cycle maybe some have been serving God for 80 years and God will deal with them and there may be somebody that just got saved 6 months ago they got filled with the Holy Ghost and they're growing with God they'll come up to to their spot and all of a sudden a sweep will come over the entire Earth and every member of the bride of Christ will be changed just like that all of us will come to that plane of maturity now there may be some that'll be there a month or so before others can you imagine when the high priest leaves his position before the altar of God for however long five minutes a day a week who knows how long it'll be he will change his garments from the order of MDC in the priesthood and the on the earth will be in that state of completion she will not need a mediator Before the Throne of God hasten the day Lord Jesus now remember John being the Apostle of love that he had an insight into the love of God I know you know that God made the body the spiritual mystical body in such a way that there would be preachers there would be deacons trustees singers Housewives all different types of people and it doesn't mean that God loves the preacher anymore more than than he loves you and it doesn't in one sense of the word mean that he has any more of the Holy Ghost than you but God calls him to do a gift that's different than your word but yet each of us grow in the love of God are you still growing brother Donnie I sure hope I am I hope I've not reached a spot to where I don't grow no more I want to know more about him every day of my life I took herol this week since the Lord taken our daughter just a little over two months ago I love the Lord Jesus after this experience now more than I've ever loved him in my life I trust him more now than I ever have in my life now I'm so grateful for that because I know some people when the Lord will take a loved one and they're praying that God will spare them and God takes them they tend to love the Lord less and they tend to trust him less but I'm so glad it didn't have that effect on me how many knows what I'm talking about now what will it do the test and the trials of life if we will function and let them go in the right way it'll actually make us better people it will deepen our love now this is one way that you can know that your love is getting deeper in God because your love for one another will also deepen so people who think they're more in love with God and yet like people less there's something wrong with their perception of Love notice John said herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment you see what perfect love does it paralyzes is dominating fear in your life now what Mortal would want to stand before almighty God and there's not a perfect one here and there's never been but only one that ever lived on the earth and that was the Lord Jesus but yet John makes this love that it will give us boldness when we stand Before the Throne of God and this is the reason why because as he is as he is present tense I am because as he is so are we we in this world now when we enter into the state of perfect love now again it's not Flawless or sinless but it is reached it has reached its place of Spiritual Development that it is complete in Christ Jesus and this is what Paul was talking about in the book of Colossians chapter 2 now remember in its development it may take years and years but love is like every other grace of God remember Remember The Graces of God are different than the gifts of God so we have tongues interpretation of tongues prophecy Word of Wisdom word of knowledge Discerning of spirits all of that but those are gifts of God but love is not necessarily just a gift of God it is a Grace of God's nature you see in the land of the sixth Dimension nobody there has Discerning of spirits there is nobody there speaking in tongues there's nobody in the sixth Dimension that is prophesying there's nobody praying for the sick but every one of them are living and have moved into the land of perfect love so even though we will have gifts in this life and we will use those gifts for the glory of God gifts are only temporal that's why I don't understand when people focus so much on gifts and they focus and push and push and push on gifts and yet they don't push on perfect love I I I don't understand that one day give will be done away withen praise the Lord there will be no pray lines in heaven there will be no doctors there will be no need of that now I want you to notice then so in its development love like the other Graces of God that it grows and it grows and it grows and the measure that God has given for each of us to attain to the worst thing you can do is try to be like this man this woman that man that woman and that is your standard don't make them your standard you want to go to God and say God what is the standard for my life now I hope this don't confuse you but I want you to listen to this the prophet said it this way Jesus led by the spirit went up to Samaria and sent all of his disciples to get away or he said to go get viddles in the city that was when John got angry with them because they wouldn't sell them anything to eat now you remember reading this in the Bible and wanted to burn the city up now this was John the Beloved disciple Le but later he became the disciple of love so John started out with this real attitude so they went into the city to buy some viddles and the people wouldn't sell Jesus nothing to eat so John got so mad and so upset that he wanted to call fire down out of heaven and destroy the whole place that's right now probably if we would have been there that day we' have looked at him and said poor old fell there ain't no hope for him are they look at that temper Lord have mercy he'll never amount to a hill of beans with it by that poor old guy little did would you and I have known maybe even little that John knowed that he would be later turned the disciple of Love Now the type of love I'm preaching to you about this morning is a love that is beyond what any human being on this Earth can ever produce by themsel God sets the standards so high there is no theologi there is no mother no matter how much she loves you there is no father there is no human being that can ever attain to this high place of love God sets the standards so high that it eradicates all of our human ability to ever arrive there there's only one way we'll ever experience it the person of Love through the act of John 3:16 will so infill our lives with his own presence he makes us a permanent resident in the Land of Love there we take up our dwelling place and there we live for the rest of our life we then are transformed from being the recipient of just the love of God of John 316 till we become the expression of First John 3:16 amen now I want you to notice again that he says and faith is the substance a look at Peter when he was walking by while he was a mortal born of sinful flesh is like I you that's right but the people had of a need of a Healer listen this carefully they had a need of a Healer and God sent Peter to do that specific work I want you to notice they needed a Healer and God sent Peter to do that specific work but he said John was love Peter didn't have the love in his heart that John had and yet Peter was a beloved Apostle you agree with that Peter was a beloved Apostle but remember he was so different that John isn't it amazing that John was the one that leaned over on Jesus bosom and John identified himself in the Book of John of course as that disciple whom Jesus loved and he also identified himself as that disciple Who Loved Jesus back so there was something special between John and Jesus it was a spiritual endowment from God that none of the rest of the Apostles ever had now Peter was the significance of God expressed in the form of Faith but John was the disciple of Love Now notice he said Peter didn't have the love in his heart that John had John was God's oh listen this term John was God's agency of love wow wouldn't that be awesome to be identified by God but wonder why most of us would prefer Peter's walk wonder why even with preachers that you find most preachers would rather that what they do and the way they're used is more visible in front of people instead of being behind the scenes praise the Lord you ever notice it it's the three vocal gifts in the in the book of Corinthians that most people want tongues interpretation prophecy wonder why it's those three vocal gifts that most humans want wonder why it's the gifts that people want they want other people to know that they're gifted in that way so they speak in tongues or they interpret or they prophesy and they want it to be done before the audience so people will know they've got that gift you know what they're lacking what John had love you see real love does not have to be catered to real love does not have to be in the Limelight as we say praise the Lord y'all going to be quiet on me this morning aren't you you see real love is the type of the love of God that whenever you reach its completion and maturity in you that if God wants to use you for a great work and hardly anybody ever even knows you've got it real love says Lord praise God if that's what you want from me Lord Jesus if nobody even knows what I do for you if nobody even knows I help this person and I do that for that person and that person oh I'm glad God's got people like that I know it is because there's people sitting here that's that way but yet for the flesh for most people they would rather do something that people would look at them and people would know you know like Peter oh Hallelujah walk down there and say to the man at the gate beautiful do you believe yes I believe such as I have given I they reach down and grab a hold of him by the hand and that man go off running and jumping and leaping glory to God I went down there Hallelujah I went down there and I laid hands on him and God healed him brother amen but how many wants to be the Disciples of Love 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 praise the Lord notice John was God's agency of love you see look here when you're taking Peter James and John hope faith and charity don't you see those gifted people them three the hope faith and charity Hope was in James he was the one who set the church in order the one that set the church in order Faith was in Peter charity was in John so here was God's Representatives on the earth now you can imagine then that Peter that was an element of about him that looked at John and thought I wish I had more love I wish I had more love anybody ever do that besides me to where you look at this person say wow I I wish I had more I wish I had more like that then there's others and it just seem like they've got such Faith you know brother B talked about Jack Cole and how that Jack Cole had that Dynamic face y'all have heard of Jack ho right so jackco would have an anvil on his pullit whenever would preach over to the side sitting on a table people come up with glasses people come up with different impairments that they would come up on a crutch Jack Cole would take it I've got a picture of him whenever he would take that crutch and take that crutch and go break it right across his leg so he you either walked or crawled back to your seat now we had that type of what was termed Bulldog face you come up with glasses I hope you had a second pair had Faith one cuz he had a hammer laying there and he would take his hammer and bust your glasses all to pieces and a a great percentage of the people got their healing and of course many of them maintain their healing yet that didn't work for everybody now there was other people that tried to do that and they didn't have very good success with it but yet God just simply used the man in that type of Avenue but it's amazing how people will capitalize on that and they look at oh that's what I want to do that's what I want to do I want people to think of me that way it'll never happen to you unless God wants you to be that way and the worst thing we can do is try to impersonate somebody else and say well I really like that that's a type of person no you don't do that you go to God and say God but what do you want me to be what do you want me to be do you want me to be a person that will be there and everybody will look at and all that oh if you are God will equip you for all of that and God will equip you for the downside of all all that because there's a great downside that comes with it and God will give you the ability to be able to do it you know the prophet said if a man claims that he's a teacher watch how he interprets the word it's easy to see that a lot of preachers are not really called of God because they make the offest mess ever was out of the word when they put it together it's an absolute mess of what you got so their supposed gift being expressed shows you they're not what they're called to be so it's the same with a man that says he has great gift of healing and faith and whenever he prays for people and nobody gets well well there's a problem with that somewhere is that right but you imagine then with John John may not have had near as many miracles but John worked in the realm of Love even when he was 90s something years old and they would bring him in a little CAU type of thing to the church at Ephesus and John was too old to preach he couldn't get up so he would just lay there and they say he just raise his hands just lay there and weep and say little children love one another you imagine being around John it was like a Dynamo that just projected from his being and this love was just created out of the resource of the soul of this man and other people would have got around said oh my what an awesome thing but I wonder how many John's that there really were how many were there that ever entered into that depth of love but yet Peter actually reached a state of perfect love but his degree and his intensity may have never been what John's was and John may have never done the Miracles that Peter did and James of course we know James you read the little book of James it's easy to see that James never did really even understand in the fullness the Gentile bride James was a Jew and James leaned toward the Jewish custom and lean toward the Church in Jerusalem you never find James going to Babylon you you never find James going to caposa you never find James going out on a great missionary work you never find James having the love and his heart for the Lord Jesus that John did so whenever you and I set our goals of what we're going to be for God don't use another man another woman another person as your standard but go to him who brought you on the earth and say what do you want me to be notice how John now as he goes on in verse 18 and he said there is no fear in love there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear now remember John is not talking about all fear if you notice him he does not say all fear the fear of God should always be in our hearts as long as we are Immortal the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge right Solomon said also and the beginning of wisdom wisdom so there should always be a reverential fear in our heart for God hold on tight now there should also be a reverential fear of men of God inside of our hearts when you lose that then you will no longer respect God's offices you see those who lose the reverential fear that God places for people to have a prophet and his word then they take those words and they cut them and they spice them and they dice them and they leave them out you know why they lost their fear of that office but God tells us in the Old Testament if I sent you a prophet and what he says comes to pass then you fear that man the love of God will not take that type of fear out of you now let me just show you a few of these whenever it comes to the angels in heaven the angels of God we know there's categories of angels of course there's cherubims seraphim zoons and and the sacrifice burners and all that but the angels of God that are of God's Eternal Essence we know there's some angels that were created and they were given the choice L like we are in the sense of free moral agency and those are the ones that was able to fall with Lucifer in the beginning but there are angels that did not fall because they could not fall so they issued out of the Eternal essence of God's being not so much coming into existence in time but just another expression of himself and you and I are part of that of course that representation so Paul wrote about the elect Angels so there are angels that are elect and there are angels that are created for the purpose to reflect the contrast in light and darkness you follow what I'm saying now with that those angels that are the elect Angels do you understand they have never experienced fear they don't know what fear is like they they don't fear God but all they know and all they've EXP experienced is love ever since they came in to their own individual expression none of the elect angels of God have ever been afraid so they would walk Before the Throne of God and they would tremble and shake and be afraid they've never experienced that so all they've known is walking and living in this presence of perfect love so when the other Angels non-elect was able to make their choice to leave with Lucifer and the dragon through his t up there and through that third part of the stars and when they did that these angels did not go neither would they feel the fear whenever Jude talks about those angels that are kept in prisons of darkness when the angels of God in heaven today when they hear about that scripture being preached those angels Don't become afraid you understand the angels of God that are elect do not become afraid when they know Angels one day will be an annihilated because that scripture is not talking about them but they don't do that out of fear this is the way many people serve God they're scared to death of God it's like God is looking for an excuse to get you and if you make one mistake he's waiting for you to mess up boy he's going to get you that's not the god of the Bible that is not the heart of God projected to us in the New Testament he loves Humanity he healed many people that he knew would never serve him but that's the love of God so the angels that are in heaven they have already experienced what the folks that move into the sixth Dimension go to experiencing when our loved ones pass beyond time and they move into that realm and when the prophet went there remember what they kept telling him this is perfect love this is perfect love but he hadn't made the connection before the visitation so he preached perfect love back in the 50s he called it Divine love and he kept calling it Divine love and perfect love and then he changed the way he would pronounce it a little bit and lingered more toward the phraseology of perfect love and then whenever he got there they told him this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost then was perfect love well when you get the Holy Ghost how do you get it do you get it all in one great big baptism initially and then whenever you get it you're a full grown son now we know that God never created Adam as a we little baby so whenever God created Adam he created him an m n a man so God never created a little baby boy and that little baby boy was laying there in the Garden of Eden kicking and screaming and squalling and God had to go down and change his diaper and pick him up and burp him and you know all that sort of thing but God's first Creation in the Garden of Eden was a full grown man it was a man that was burst into his godship when he took the Breath of Life remember man was made to be a God In the Garden of Eden so whenever Adam took the Breath of Life there he stood with his toes down in the dirt and he was standing there lifeless and then the Bible says and God breathed into his nostrils the breast of life now when God breathed into him the Hebrew word there is ruach ruach so God breathed God breathed so it was the Breath of God the spirit of God the same thing that moved upon the face of the deep very same Hebrew word so God breathed into Adam's nostrils the breath of life and he became a living Soul so you imagine he's standing there like a tree no life his eyes aren't batting he's just a hunk of clay so all the senu the cells the tissues the blood all that is there and then when God breathes into him he becomes a living Soul so it goes from being a dead dry clay statue to becoming a living God just that and God breathes into his nostrils the breath of life so with that Breath of Life come the knowledge of God with that Breath of Life come every potential of everything he could ever be unlike you and I when we receive the Holy Ghost we have to start growing and learning growing and learning Adam did not have to learn Adam did not have to learn how to become a God in this Kingdom he did not have to learn how to shun this and that and the other the image of God was breathed into him by the Breath of God you see when a person then goes beyond this veil of time here and whenever many of our loved ones are going and we say oh it's so it's so awful they they was they was in so much pain and we we know we've been there we've seen all of that but don't you understand what's happening when they're leaving here they're being burst into that other world they're being burst into that other world and the birst Pains of death are coming around them and maybe they have to have you know something to help ease the the pain don't you see what it is to us it's so sad and it's so sorrowful but the Bible says precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints he's looking at it from that other dimension and we're saying oh it breaks my heart it breaks my heart but he's saying come on home daughter of God come on home Son of God and they're being burst into that other realm and there they lay oh my and the life leaves their body in a moment in a twinkling of an eye that moved Beyond this Mortal Veil and they are burst into that body Hallelujah that Paul said that in second Corinthians oh that there is a house there that was prepared for us when before the foundation of the world when they are burst into that think of it in that theophany they know all things what is it they are burst into that expression of what we bypassed to come here to be tempted as a mortal and they move into that realm oh I wonder what they're doing there today well I can tell you a little bit about what they're doing they ain't got no watch on their hor because they ain't got no place to be they're not going anywhere for lunch cuz they don't eat they ain't got no beds because they don't lay down they ain't got no doctor's office cuz they don't get sick they ain't got no dentist office because they got Eternal teeth Hallelujah they ain't got no worries they ain't got no troubles they ain't got no handkerchiefs used for crying because they don't cry they ain't got no tiing off for headaches cuz they don't have no headaches they ain't got no worries oh I wish somebody would preach with me this morning they're not down they ain't got no pills to have to take when they're depressed because they don't have no depression they ain't got no uppers and no downers and no inners and no outers because every moment there is eternal happiness Eternal Joy Eternal peace in the presence of God hallelujah they have entered into that word form body so what is it it's a land it's a real sphere it's a dimension it's a land of perfect love perfect love you see when the soul becomes into this realm of perfect love then the body be comes subject more to the imminent force of that love from the soul you see Love Will cast out then this dominating fear that we're all born with why is it that your reflexes are made to within 3/4 of a second that if a car stops in front of you somebody makes up they're going to uh make up their mind they're going to stop they hit their brakes in 3/4 of a second you will react now aren't you glad that God knew that there would be cars aren't you glad God didn't make our reaction time two and a half minutes most of us wouldn't be here today would we we' be pushing up daisies somewhere but God made the reaction time in the natural now we've got what we call fight or flight so whenever we are in a situation and we can sense danger and harm perfect love does not take that out of us it leaves it there so whenever you go out of church and say well somebody pulled in front of me and I laid on the horn oh look I must there have perfect love no you was trying to protect yourself from being hit by that car that was going to sideswipe you perfect love does not take that out the change of your home place will when you move beyond the land of cars and trucks perfect love though will take out out the fear of death I've stood by the bedside of many Saints I buried over 10 some people since I've been here as the pastor of this church so I've been I've had to experience more than my share of death other than me I mean I hope I don't have to experience it myself I'm kind of hoping I'll be one of them that'll be alive and change and I've seen the death of many saints of God I've never seen one that was scared I've seen him young and old I've never seen one that was terrified of dying why love had reached its maturity oh my it doesn't cast out a fear that you're 39,000 ft in the air you're in a Boeing 777 you're going 656 miles an hour there's not a cloud in the sky you've got a Coke in your hand and a little cracker or whatever they give you on the airplane you know how they've reduced everything anymore and you're just sitting there smiling like a posle you're having the best time in your life and all of a sudden that plan goes and of course you got perfect loveed you just sit there that didn't bother me well pray for me cuz it still does you see perfect love does not take out all fear but the fear that has torment some of you are afraid to do what God has called you to do because of the torment of failure the torment of other people before you well so and so did this oh they made the offest mess ever was and that allows fear to dominate your life you see some fear is necessary for our well-being in humanity but it's the painful distressing fear that God hates to control his children some people live under the fear of poverty maybe they were poor once in their life and they're scared to death of being poor and boy when they go to give a dollar in the offering you can tell which one they give cuz every George Washington is baldheaded as a pumpkin they pull his hair Plum off the paper the fear of loss the fear of sickness the fear of bement you see when God will take a person from us and we look at oh Lord oh no no several people are told me oh brother Donnie the Lord took sister Erica well well he take her he could take anybody duh you mean you just found that out well brother Donnie could take you that's right he certainly could but I live every day I'm ready every hour if he wants to Here I Am Lord come and get me God don't want us to live underneath that type of fear somebody said God don't want us to live under the fear of sickness I know that Old Co devil is trying to raise its head back up Among Us and people are terrified of Co I think we need to look at devil to their face and say get on back to Hell devil you ain't controll in my life turn with me to St John 13:34 now watch here's the very heart of God not the law of God not the justice of God and Jesus was not just a prophet of God but he was God the prophet which is a great difference so here he comes with a New Covenant and a new testament but he also adds a new commandment now Moses gave 10 but there's going to be many more in the New Testament notice in St John 13:34 a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another now don't stop there right come on now this is the way we're supposed to love one another and this is the Commandment of the Lord Jesus as I have loved you so the new commandment in the new covant is that we are to love one another as Jesus loves us now how does he do that unconditionally do you want Jesus to love you when you're out of sorts you want Jesus to love you when you're not deserving of Love You Want Jesus to love you even when you mess up well that's the new commandment that we're supposed to love our brothers and sisters the same way oh my fix I I guess it's fixing to get really quiet on me ain't it a new commandment I given to you that you love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another I want you to notice this is actually going to be a badge of discipleship this is going to be the true the true identification of Jesus disciples the true identification which can never be impersonated it's the only thing in the Bible tongues can be impersonated prophecy can be impersonated jumping shouting running but this can never be impersonated it's the true Badge of discipleship how many wants it amen this command now notice a new commandment I given to you that you love one another as I have loved you so this that he's about to leave with his church is to be the badge of discipleship that might be distinguished above every other thing you see false anointed ones will stand up according to Matthew chapter 24 and they'll stand before the Lord Jesus and say I cast out devils in your name I heal the sick in your name I raise the dead in your name I proph propes do you realize one of the greatest Old Testament prophecies speaking about the star that would rise out of Jacob and a scepter that would come Numbers chapter 24 do you realize one of the greatest prophecies giving of the coming of the Lord Jesus was given by a false prophet balum that man gave such a prophecy it was absolutely awesome astounding and he will stand before the Lord God that day and be judged and turned into Eternal separation prophecy is not a badge a true Badge of discipleship tongues well Glory you see this had never been given before before this had never been said before it had never been known like this that it would be a distinguishable one distinguishable attribute that would separate his elect from all other people on the Earth cuz many people can dress like a Christian should dress but they take them clothes off and they could put on other clothes and take on another identity so they could sing about the cross and say I love the Lord I Want to Go to Heaven that's not the distinguishable attribute of wanting to go to heaven but it's loving like he loves which can only be done when he himself gets in our soul everybody understand this is impossible for me this is impossible for you so let's just settle this right now we cannot ever accomplish this on our own there's only one way him be inside of us loving when we can't forgiving when we can't oh praise be to God now notice he says as I have loved you let's read again if you would in St John 15:12 this is my commandment that you love one another notice again Jesus says the same thing as I have loved you now he knows Peter's going to deny him he knows Peter's going to turn into a cussing preacher he knows that all the rest of them is going to deny them and walk away but Jesus loved them to the end the Bible says so he knew what they were going to do they was going to turn away from him they was going to leave him to die alone and yet he they love them the same boy this is hard for us isn't it can we love people that talk about us and run us down and cause all types of injury to us personally amen 1 two 3 4 boy them hands are getting fewer and fewer notice this is my Commandment that you love one another as I have loved you verse 17 these things I command now remember these are not options these are commands now we're talking about rapturing material these things I command you that you love one another now as I said as my opening remarks that so many quote John 36 16 but don't raise your hands but I wonder how many of you even know by memory what first John 3:16 even says wonder why wonder why we know John 3:16 but we're not near as familiar with first John 3:16 well in one way it's quite simple John 3:16 is what he did 1 John 3:16 is what he does in us so it puts us in under the gun shall we read it whosoever watch in verse 15 there I love the way John contrast is when you get time maybe this evening maybe read all of chapter three and you'll find that God that John sets the contrast up of Cain and Abel and he gives the example of Cain how that Cain hated his brother of course and killed him and then he sets up the contrast of a person that says they love versus one that really does love and verse 15 he said whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him 1 John 3 16 hereby perceive we the love of God now look at the Greek word here perceive in the perfect tense Ginos in the perfect sense the word speaks of knowledge gained by experience so it's not just reading reading reading memorizing memorizing memorizing and committing it to memory and quoting quoting quoting and then that's that that's not knowledge no it's a knowledge that you gain by experiencing something so John says for those of us who have experienc herein perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us so the Saints have experienced the love of God in that he laid down his life for them now it's a two-faced experience then if you've really experienced that then part two of verse 16 will be in your soul to want to give expression to that love and this is the way the love of God continues on so they become the recipients of Salvation this imparts to them a Divine knowledge by experience now notice what Jo John goes on to say hereby perceive we the love of God because because he laid down his life for us we ought to lay down our lives wow for the Brethren so I have to be honest with you friends I I don't understand any Christian that likes to persecute people I I don't understand anybody that likes to persecute saints of God and make make life harder for them do you I don't understand that I don't understand anyone who could claim to be a Christian and get something out of posting things on Facebook or whatever they would do to make life harder for another individual I don't understand that that is not first John 3:16 now notice John catches this I remember being the disciple of love and reading this and studying this I couldn't keep from wondering about Peter what Peter must have thought when he read this verse and I wonder Peter wouldn't say like some of us help me Jesus help me Jesus now Peter's Faith was great to heal the sick John's was great to set the church in order and he was hope James brother but you imagine when John was sitting there in the spirit of God and this is written about the time of the Book of Revelation 90 ad so it was written around the time that the great Revelations are unfolding to John so with this Revelation John moves into this sphere of love that he had never experienced before you imagine what would make a man this is the very same man who wrote down John 3:16 that's right amen the very same man but something it happened to John after John 3:16 and after it happened to John John could write first John 3:16 because John 3:16 God had so given his love that John could say I have experienced that I believe there's many people today that can say the same thing how many can say with the reality I also and first John 3:16 okay we're going to make an a call for the rest of it I'm going to cancel lunch and pray for you now notice how he contrast this between Cain it's a stark contrast between hatred and real genuine love now this is a love that's unath you got to be kidding me that God would want us to love one another so much that we would be willing to lay our lives down for one another people think love you know well love your enemies all what that means is I don't I don't do nothing evil against them no no that's actually not what it means what it means is that you go out of your way to do good for people that would kill you if they could you see I'm moving farther and farther and farther away from the human conjecture of love to move you into a realm of total impossibility without divine intervention look friends I don't care how much you run how much you speak in tongues how much you shout how much you heal the sick you can give millions of dollars to the poor but if you don't have this you will never listen to me you will never go in the Rapture this is rapture status God help us can I got have a few more minutes four of you going to give me a few more minutes okay I'll take that Paul in Romans 16:13 greet Priscilla and Aquilla my helpers in Christ Jesus who have for my life laid down their own necks so here were people that were expressing first John 316 before it was ever written you see when Paul writes the book of Romans here around 55 ad 60 something like that Aquilla and Priscilla were living this manifestation before John ever even wrote it in first John so you see this is why the Bible says that ye are living and written Epistles read and known of all men so what are we doing we're simply catching up with that which has been written for us but with them God was simply letting the writing catching up as a manifestation In the Flesh W well that went over the top of your head they were living it before it was even written so they were giving their lives now we don't know exactly the instance because we don't know all the examples and things that Paul went through as far as persecution and so on but apparently Aquilla and Priscilla which were husband and wife and all the Jews were banned out of Rome of course under the reign of Claudius the emperor and they had given he he literally used it as if though they had laid their necks down and this is a symbolism of of a metaphor that would say you know metaphor in our day that they literally laid their necks down on the chopping block for their heads to be cut off for this man of God oh amen John 3:16 had become so personified in these Christians they were willing to give their necks to save this man of God I find that so strange because many will give their souls an eternal separation to try to bring down every man of God they can that's the difference in hatred and love there are people who study men there are people who listen to our prophet message every day they listen to try to find fault they try to find this and that and the other so they can be able to post that on their site and do this and that don't they understand apparently not that one day they will stand before the Judgment seat and give an account many of them spend more time since they've left than they did while they were in it had they ate what they were listening to and become it their end might have been different oh but when the love of God so grabs a hold of a predestinated seed remember I ain't talking about everybody that's professes Christianity I ain't even talking about everybody that has the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's question answer brother branam well every born again Christian go in the rapture no my brother sister they will not only the elect so that's watered down gospel that's been preached around the world not only around the world but even some of our message preachers are preaching it well you can belong to this denomination and that denomination whatever more and being the Rapture that is an absolute lie straight from the pits of hell I said straight from the pits of hell why am the world that we need a message in the end time to call us out and wash us from that filth of those prostitutes if we can stay in there and have rapturing faith come on somebody Hallelujah I want hell to know where we stand today on the Gospel of Jesus Christ you see the test of real discipleship is not just refusing to do someone harm which is where many of us hide we just refuse to do them harm that's not it it's actually looking for an opportunity when you can do them good you say where do you do where do you get that at I see it every day in this world we live in what if the Lord Jesus within the next 5 minutes stops every human being from breathing his created air that he gives them freely and he will only let those filled with the Holy Ghost breathe his air you talking about a mass burial what if the Lord stops sending rain for long spring will be around summer will be around we'll start planting our seeds our Gardens and so on and God says I'll tell you what I ain't going to do I ain't giving no more you bunch of Sinners my rain I'm only going to get my children rain I ain't even going to give y'all no more sun I'm going to start creating the Sun and in such a way that the sun will only shine on my children but Jesus said The Sun Shines on and the rain on the just and the unjust they don't even thank him for it how many of them had Thanksgiving dinner did they even pray did they even bow their head and say thank God but they SE celebrate it with wine come on here we are the last day of the year what would a lot of them do a lot of them say Lord thank you for another year they'll be drunk on a bunch of monkeys by in the morning and they'll get up and the headache and a hangover come on somebody but you know what if you're a child of God you say Lord thank you for what you helped us through 23 may we be better Christians than 24 may we give our life so he does good to those that hate him scientists that say there is no God and he gives them oxygen to breathe because he loves Humanity amen I just read this week the Lord God allowed science to break into an enzyme in the core of pineapple I want you to listen to this and by research he let them find that enzyme braling and they started using it on burn victim now up to this time a burn victim they would have to go into the epidermis and all them different layers of skin and get down to where the skin would actually bleed but what they found was they could extract this broline from a core of a pineapple and put that on burn skin and within 4 hours every bit of that burn skin is totally dissolved of course man will take credit for it well was man the one who put it in the core of the pineapple God in his Mercy let man find what he already put inside of there now maybe that might not mean much to you cuz most of us ain't never been burned but I guarantee you one thing those that have been burned the many of them will be spared from this time on of having to go through one surgery after another after another why the grace of God let them break into his laboratory I praise God for that myself I thank God for every one of those things they can find but remember they never made that it was not them that put it there God put it there that's why the prophet prayed every day they would find a cure for cancer why because he loved Humanity I know I've give you a lot to contemplate but we'll be like sheep we'll ruminate we'll feed on it again and again and again let's stand we'll pick it up again I found this I thought it was very interesting self-preservation is the first law of physical life but self-sacrifice is the First Law of Spiritual life a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you any honest people here today I know there are that can say Lord I need more of this I need more love is greater than healing love is greater than emotion it's the most powerful force that's ever been given to the world love for myself as we come to the close of this year this year my what a year it has been I'm so glad at the beginning of this year I did not look down through 23 and see all the things we were going want to go through amen I did not have a clue at the beginning of 23 that my little daughter will be taken from us I didn't have a clue that many that have set Among Us would be taken from us many of the things you've been through you probably thought oh my I'm so glad I didn't know it was going to happen I understand I'm glad I can't look into 24 because I'd probably be scared to death when you you say oh my goodness what's coming what's coming but God don't want us to live under under that captivating paralyzing fear I'm glad I cannot see in the future myself I just have enough light to walk day by day by day amen thank God for it can we bow our heads now with sincerity from your heart I want to ask you how many of you said Lord I'm being honest before you today I need more of what I heard preached I don't want to just just refuse to do bad against people but I want to look for opportunities of good I thank you I'm a recipient of the grace of God but I also want to be the manifestation of 1 John 3:16 hallelujah thank you Lord we're going to pray just had this request given to me pray for brother Matthew carway and sister shayvon they both have been here in the service today but both of them have been sick all during the service let's pray for them right now as well father we come before you as children children that we realize without your love and your mercy in our hearts will never be able to attain to this great great love it seems almost unfathomable in our minds that a human being could get to a spot that they would do this and not do it because of legalism but do it because you are so in their souls they want to do it I'm sure there's people on this this building if it was between me and them dying if a man walked in this building today with a gun and said I'm going to shoot one of you there's Brothers in here that I know that love me so much that' say no take me let him live He's a blessing to so many people don't take him take me I know they would I don't know how many people sisters that would tell Erica sister Erica I would gladly give my life and let you live brother told me the other day his wife had said she was an older lady and said I I would give my life to let sister Erica Live Well the younger sisters even of our church said it I would gladly give my life so sister Erica could live that's a great love but father they didn't have have to do that you gave yours so she could live and she does she does live but it does our hearts good to hear Lord that we can enter into this land of perfect love that we would be willing to lay down our lives for one another oh what a reward that aquill and Priscilla will receive that day whatever the instance was that they had put their lives in Jeopardy Lord what a reward it will be for men of God who have jeopardized their lives preaching the gospel Lord some of the brothers that went into the jungles of Africa and India and the Philippines risked their lives I know some of the missionary Brothers in Africa have went among the head hunters they still have Head Hunters alive today and risk their lives to introduce them to the Lord Jesus they risk their lives to preach the truth brothers that have gone in to China into Vietnam into places where it's illegal to preach the gospel having stood there in China myself several times and knowing I risk being arrested rested every time I went but seeing those saints that hunger in their hearts seeing their faith so simple Lord I don't know that I'll ever forget that sister in that hotel room that night Lord they pushed her in in a wheelchair she couldn't walk but after prayer was made and at the end of the service she pushed her wheelchair out of the room how Hallelujah because you're still the same yesterday today and forever we love to see you manifest yourself that way Lord but we're asking you today for something even greater than the lame walking we're asking you for something greater Lord we've seen you heal the sick we saw you right here just a few minutes ago Lord raise a sister that had stopped breathing we saw you give her life but father today we're standing here as your needy children asking for something greater than the lame walking the blind seeeing asking that we would move into that land of perfect love where we could forgive those that hate us those that have brought us so much sorrow and pain Lord I know from me my greatest hurts it's not been among the world Sinners my greatest hurts down through the years have been among Christians the greatest wounds of my heart as Carol told me not long ago you said I feel so sorry for you so I can't imagine the scars that's on your poor heart the wounds on my heart as is these people here it's not been brought by drunks and thieves and robbers
