[39:21] it's worth a living just
[39:26] because healing
[39:28] [Music]
[39:40] Carolyn I was talking about it yesterday
[39:43] she said how do people live without the
[39:45] Lord
[39:47] as you know the sad part about it is
[39:49] some of them do
[39:51] and they really don't think they need
[39:53] him
[39:54] I said that you and I ought to be so
[39:56] happy because the truth of it is we
[39:58] couldn't
[39:59] do you realize without the Lord in your
[40:01] life some of you would just take your
[40:03] life
[40:04] you'd end up on pills you'd end up on
[40:07] this that another because you're made
[40:09] to live for God you're made to need him
[40:13] isn't that a blessing you're made to
[40:15] need God you just you can't function
[40:17] without any brother Paul we have to have
[40:19] him in our lives I'm so grateful that
[40:22] it's that way
[40:23] God bless you let's turn tonight to
[40:25] First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 11.
[40:30] let's go back to the
[40:33] Great Master
[40:34] Builder
[40:36] of the New Testament age
[40:42] First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 11.
[40:46] now Paul is speaking
[40:48] to ministers
[40:51] in these first few verses preachers and
[40:54] is likening them to builders as well but
[40:59] he doesn't call them Master Builders
[41:02] now he's warning preachers and telling
[41:05] them what they must be careful of but
[41:07] don't just focus tonight on the
[41:10] descriptions for preachers only but in
[41:13] one sense it's for all of us
[41:16] As we sing the song I'm working on a
[41:19] building I'm working on a building well
[41:22] everybody here is working on it in some
[41:24] way or another
[41:25] because your life testifies and will
[41:29] reach people and either convince them or
[41:31] make them wonder you know if the truth
[41:34] is really right or not so each of us
[41:36] have something to contribute but here
[41:39] Paul is focusing on the preachers and
[41:42] listen what he says for other Foundation
[41:44] can no man lay then that is laid which
[41:50] is Jesus Christ now if any man
[41:55] and Paul was really really strange here
[41:58] because he didn't believe women ought to
[42:00] preach
[42:03] so he didn't say any women preachers but
[42:05] he said any man
[42:07] build upon this Foundation
[42:10] gold
[42:12] silver
[42:14] precious stones wood
[42:17] hay
[42:18] stubble
[42:20] gold silver
[42:22] precious stones wood hay stubble
[42:27] Every Man's work shall be made manifest
[42:31] for the day now listen how he says this
[42:34] for the day shall declare it
[42:37] because it shall be revealed by fire
[42:42] and the fire shall try every man's work
[42:47] of what sort
[42:49] it is
[42:51] notice now
[42:53] if any man's work abide
[42:58] which he has built thereupon
[43:02] he shall receive a reward
[43:05] if any man's work shall be burned
[43:10] he shall suffer loss
[43:14] but he himself
[43:15] shall be saved
[43:18] yet so
[43:19] as by fire
[43:22] now listen to this what up what a
[43:24] astounding thing
[43:27] Paul separates men's work
[43:31] from their destiny
[43:36] so there will be preachers
[43:39] that will absolutely lose every
[43:43] every work
[43:46] that they have done
[43:48] in the Name of Christ
[43:51] but will be saved themselves
[43:57] oh
[43:59] I guess we better dismiss right now if
[44:01] y'all gonna be this quiet
[44:02] that's what your Bible says
[44:05] if any man's work shall be burned
[44:09] he shall suffer loss
[44:12] but he himself
[44:14] shall be saved
[44:16] yet so
[44:18] as by far
[44:20] I've made love to be remembered to
[44:22] announce we pray
[44:24] sister Martha sacker has a couple of
[44:26] cousins that are very needy and prayer
[44:28] and she want us to pray over this
[44:29] tonight May preach with him I mean he
[44:31] has a need in your life maybe your body
[44:33] your home your wall
[44:36] Heavenly Father we bow our heads to the
[44:39] dust of the Earth from whence we were
[44:41] taken
[44:42] knowing Lord one day unless the change
[44:45] comes we will go back that way
[44:49] the Lord as I said this afternoon
[44:50] [Music]
[44:52] reading these scriptures and looking at
[44:55] them Father and
[44:57] you heard the cry
[44:59] of my heart
[45:02] dear God I am
[45:04] I never want to be
[45:07] this
[45:08] this scripture
[45:10] I do not want to fulfill this Lord
[45:13] I don't want to be
[45:15] a man that would give years of my life
[45:19] to the cause
[45:21] and then find out
[45:24] that I had built it out of wood hay or
[45:27] stubble
[45:29] I pray father that I wouldn't be the
[45:31] only one in this place tonight
[45:33] but may each of us
[45:35] realize what a a tremendous thing that
[45:38] this is but yet a serious thing as well
[45:42] father you see these needs represented
[45:44] by these handkerchiefs that I have I'm
[45:46] asking you that you would be with the
[45:48] Lord
[45:49] everybody that raised their hand it
[45:51] signified a request a desire would you
[45:54] meet that tonight father
[45:56] I pray for those that are sick could be
[45:58] with us in the service tonight
[46:00] father you see that Scotty had an
[46:03] accident yesterday with a saw and hurt
[46:05] his thumb and Lord real bad pain Eric is
[46:08] still dealing with the shingles we're
[46:10] believing you father for a complete
[46:12] deliverance for her
[46:13] Lord Jesus so many needs and we just
[46:16] thank you that you are God and you take
[46:18] care of all of them bless us tonight
[46:20] fathers we're gathered here in Jesus
[46:22] name amen God bless you you may be
[46:25] seated
[46:30] let's look in second Corinthians chapter
[46:33] five
[46:34] verse 10.
[46:37] I'm sure you realize already that
[46:40] there's a great difference between the
[46:43] white Throne judgment
[46:45] and what is identified as the bhima
[46:50] b-e-m-a
[46:53] the bema
[46:54] thrawn or the bema Judgment the white
[46:59] Throne will be of course the Book of
[47:01] Revelation and John says I saw the dead
[47:03] most small and great stand before God
[47:05] and the books were open and another book
[47:07] was opened which is The Book of Life and
[47:09] the dead were judged out of those things
[47:12] which are written in the books now there
[47:14] it is a judgment of Destiny based upon
[47:18] works
[47:19] but what Paul is going to read or going
[47:22] to tell us here tonight that we'll read
[47:24] you in a minute is not a judgment of
[47:28] Destiny but it is a judgment of rewards
[47:32] by works now we are not saved by works
[47:36] everybody believes that
[47:39] Grace is what he did for us works is
[47:43] what we do back for him and his kingdom
[47:46] but because Works doesn't save us
[47:49] doesn't mean that we don't want to have
[47:52] works we do want to have the right kind
[47:55] of works but we want to make sure that
[47:59] the works that we are doing are based on
[48:02] the word and that we're not basically
[48:04] wasting our time
[48:06] because the setting that Paul lays out
[48:10] for us it's quite phenomenal
[48:12] that someone could labor
[48:15] in the name of Jesus
[48:18] they can actually preach Christ
[48:22] they could preach that he is the messiah
[48:26] the son of God
[48:28] that he raised from the dead
[48:31] that he does wonderful things
[48:34] and yet at the end of the way they will
[48:37] lose every sermon they ever preached
[48:41] every hour that they studied it will be
[48:45] as if though there's no record at all
[48:49] now let me be the first one to say to
[48:52] you tonight I'm not sure how all of this
[48:55] works but I know one thing it ain't
[48:58] going to work for me I'm not going to be
[49:01] that type of a guy
[49:02] now will there be differences of degrees
[49:06] in Heaven There Will Be
[49:08] I don't think there'll be anybody there
[49:11] that will be walking around heaven sad
[49:14] and downcast and a broken attitude and
[49:17] you can tell by looking at that person
[49:19] that they suffered loss and they have no
[49:22] reward I I'll just be the first one to
[49:24] tell you I don't know exactly how it's
[49:26] going to work but I know this is God's
[49:29] word and it has to work right
[49:32] but I do know according to what we've
[49:34] just read there will be people that will
[49:37] suffer a tremendous loss and the Greek
[49:41] word that is used there we'll get to in
[49:43] a bit but it's as if though God it's
[49:47] it's it's that they are punished in a
[49:50] sense with a fine
[49:53] so they are fined because their work was
[49:59] destroyed I said how could that be
[50:02] brother darling it's all because of the
[50:05] material that they use
[50:08] now we may look at him and say oh my
[50:10] this man's a great man always preached
[50:12] for 45 years he done this and that and
[50:14] the other but you see God looks at more
[50:17] than the years that the man may have
[50:20] studied or the years that the man might
[50:23] have been a pastor or a bishop or a
[50:25] teacher or whatever more but God also
[50:28] looks at the motive and the objective
[50:31] while the man is preaching
[50:34] because you see every man that preaches
[50:36] is not preaching for the right reason
[50:40] every man that studies does not study
[50:43] for the right cause now people sometimes
[50:47] don't pick that up sheep are able to
[50:50] hear them and say wow man I already
[50:51] enjoyed that guy boy does really really
[50:53] good but you see God don't just look at
[50:56] his ability to speak but God looks at
[50:59] the man's heart to know why the man is
[51:02] preaching now I know I know it's I just
[51:05] can't even I can't even comprehend this
[51:07] I've got to be honest with you I can't
[51:10] imagine a preacher preaching for any
[51:13] other reason than being because God
[51:16] called him I honestly cannot process
[51:19] that a man would want to be a preacher
[51:22] and want to get up before people and
[51:25] want to study and want to put himself
[51:28] through so much torment in life
[51:32] for Envy
[51:34] or for jealousy of another man
[51:39] well you're looking at me funny but in a
[51:41] few minutes you'll have to say Amen
[51:42] because I'm going to prove that to you
[51:43] from the Bible
[51:45] now watch this in second Corinthians
[51:47] chapter 5 verse 10. for we notice now
[51:50] Paul is referring to himself as the rest
[51:53] of the Saints so he's speaking to the
[51:54] Corinthian Saints as well for we must
[51:57] all appear before the Judgment seat of
[52:02] Christ now keep in mind that there's two
[52:05] judgments and there's two judgment seats
[52:08] now the word that he used right here is
[52:10] a different word than the one that was
[52:13] used in the Book of Revelation this one
[52:14] is bhima
[52:16] b-e-m-a it is an elevated place an
[52:21] elevated place that people walk out on
[52:25] so it's not like on a level Plateau but
[52:29] it is an elevated place and people walk
[52:32] out on this elevated position and there
[52:36] they are going to be judged for their
[52:39] works now remember the bride does not go
[52:42] in the Rapture because of works the
[52:45] bride is not bride because of Works she
[52:49] is bride because of election and the
[52:53] church said
[52:54] she is called by God chosen by God
[52:57] there's not one thing she can do to make
[53:00] herself bright and let me go to the
[53:03] other side of that there's not one thing
[53:05] she can ever do to unmake herself bride
[53:08] if she is she is and if she ain't she
[53:13] ain't
[53:13] now that's pretty common you should be
[53:15] able to anybody should be able to
[53:16] understand that but there is a
[53:20] distinction even in the bride when it
[53:23] will come to works now are there people
[53:26] in The Bride that possibly might fit
[53:29] into this category that at the bhima
[53:32] they will be fined they will lose their
[53:38] their reward well you know what I'm no
[53:41] judge that's for God to say but now
[53:44] let's read so for all we must all appear
[53:48] before the Judgment seat of Christ that
[53:52] everyone may receive the things done in
[53:55] his body according to that he has done
[53:59] whether it be good or bad now listen
[54:02] carefully so Paul says then that all
[54:06] believers will come before the Lord
[54:09] Jesus in this elevated platform called
[54:13] the B now they are going to be tested to
[54:18] say what type of building material that
[54:21] they used in the house of God
[54:24] now excuse me the object of the test is
[54:30] that our works may be categorized now
[54:34] Paul Dunn said it in First Corinthians
[54:35] here that the day will declare our works
[54:39] so we don't want to just do do just a
[54:42] bunch of stuff for God but we want to
[54:44] make sure that what we're doing will
[54:46] well brother Donnie how can I be sure
[54:48] judge it by the word right now let it
[54:52] pass the test right now and you'll have
[54:55] nothing to worry about then
[54:57] but you see those who shirk the word and
[55:01] they won't let what they feel led to do
[55:05] be judged by the word more than likely
[55:08] they'll suffer loss because you see a
[55:11] real believer is not afraid of the word
[55:14] they're not afraid of the word at all
[55:15] because they know the spirit of God will
[55:18] never leave you or you or me or anyone
[55:21] else to do anything contrary to what his
[55:25] word says and the church says
[55:27] you mean I'm going to live my whole life
[55:30] and I'll get to the end of the way and
[55:31] I'll perish nope not if you don't want
[55:33] to well you say how will I know that I
[55:36] won't suffer loss judge it by the word
[55:38] right now and if you're using hay wood
[55:42] and stubble get rid of it and use
[55:45] building material that will be able to
[55:47] withstand the fire now I want you to
[55:50] notice categorically how that Paul
[55:52] breaks this down and he places Gold
[55:55] Silver and precious gems or Jewels now
[56:00] those are Treasures which most of the
[56:03] time must be mined out of the earth now
[56:08] of course there's been times that
[56:09] somebody would be on out on a Creek
[56:11] Hunting or they'd be doing this as it
[56:13] was in the gold rush in 1849 in Alaska
[56:16] as it was in the Black Hills of South
[56:18] Dakota and different places and they
[56:20] would be in a creek or something like
[56:22] that and they would see a little speck
[56:24] of gold then they would start digging
[56:26] and looking around but for the most part
[56:29] Gold Silver and precious gems have to be
[56:33] mined out of the earth now remember Paul
[56:35] for the over emphasizing this I hope it
[56:38] don't bother you too much that he's
[56:40] pointing this mainly at preachers so
[56:44] there are a category of preachers and
[56:47] they preach stubble sermons they preach
[56:51] would sermons they preach chaff type of
[56:56] sermons so they really don't spend a lot
[56:58] of time mining the refined resources
[57:02] that God's gave them because it just
[57:05] simply takes too much time so they just
[57:08] go out you know what you could be able
[57:10] together stubble and would and hey
[57:13] probably in your backyard you'll be able
[57:15] to go right out there and you'll be able
[57:17] to pick it up it's not very pretty it's
[57:19] not of great resource it has hard and no
[57:21] value at all but if you get gold and
[57:24] silver and precious gems they're going
[57:27] to have to be mined it will take prayer
[57:30] it will take consecration to God it may
[57:33] take steady and nor steady and more
[57:36] study but you know what I've realized is
[57:38] that if you've got lazy Christians
[57:40] sitting in the Pew they really don't
[57:42] like a well-minding preacher because
[57:45] that well-minding preacher wears them
[57:48] out so what they really prefer is a wood
[57:51] preacher or a stubble preacher or a hate
[57:54] preacher because that's all they hear
[57:56] that's all they want to live and they
[57:59] don't want no more well I guess you and
[58:01] him can be burned up together
[58:04] oh my goodness now watch this this is
[58:07] not my saying now I'm reading to you
[58:09] from the Bible right y'all believe this
[58:10] is the Bible so the outcome of this test
[58:14] the owner of the gold the silver and the
[58:19] precious gems that owner will receive a
[58:24] reward but the owner of the wood now
[58:27] this will be in refutable it cannot be
[58:29] questioned because you are standing
[58:31] there every preacher every preacher in
[58:34] the message where it's an evangelist a
[58:36] teacher a pastor claims to be a prophet
[58:38] claims to be an apostle whatever it
[58:40] claims to be his work will be made
[58:43] manifest and the day will declare it so
[58:47] there'll be no way to get away from it
[58:49] it'll not be said well you know what no
[58:51] no no that's not me you've got the wrong
[58:53] guy that that's brother John's work
[58:55] there Lauren I know now I'm Donnie
[58:57] Reagan this is my work right here I will
[59:00] be identified with everything that I do
[59:03] the sermons that I preach the amount of
[59:06] time I put into it I will be I will
[59:09] answer before God I think of preachers
[59:12] really believe this that spend a whole
[59:15] lot more time than to be a whole lot
[59:16] more careful about what they say when
[59:18] they stand up before God's people but
[59:21] somehow we've got it in our mind that as
[59:23] bride we never stand before in this room
[59:27] at all you need to re-read your Bible
[59:29] because Paul is not speaking now to the
[59:33] non-elect or the foolish virgin so
[59:36] notice how that he brings this out and
[59:39] he says the others now what it will be
[59:41] with the wood the hay and the stubble it
[59:44] will be Tried by the fire now of course
[59:48] this is a metaphoric symbol that was
[59:50] used in the Old Testament as well as the
[59:52] new and if yours is the gold the silver
[59:56] and the precious stones then they will
[59:59] abide in the fire so you're not afraid
[1:00:02] of the fire a real believer they really
[1:00:05] don't they don't prefer tests over the
[1:00:08] Mountaintop they like a good Mountaintop
[1:00:10] experience every now and then but
[1:00:12] they're not afraid of the valley they're
[1:00:14] not afraid of the fire because they
[1:00:17] believe what they have is pure genuine
[1:00:20] and right and what will the fire do I
[1:00:23] told you several years ago Carol and I
[1:00:25] went to South Africa and we went down to
[1:00:28] a a place that they used to mine gold we
[1:00:30] went way way down and back into this
[1:00:32] place and they had a pot of gold out
[1:00:35] there and they would heat it up I forget
[1:00:37] how many degrees that it was and they
[1:00:40] explained it that they'd heeded this
[1:00:42] same pot of gold over and over and over
[1:00:44] again and they get it to thousands of
[1:00:47] degrees as far as to be able to make it
[1:00:49] where it would become molten and then
[1:00:51] they would pour it out and the the man
[1:00:53] explained every time that they heeded
[1:00:56] this goal to this level it made it that
[1:00:59] much more pure each time now the first
[1:01:03] time that you would have put a piece of
[1:01:05] wood under that fire we know what would
[1:01:08] have happened two thousand degrees it
[1:01:10] would have burned up in a matter of
[1:01:11] minutes and it would have been nothing
[1:01:13] but ashes well what about hay less than
[1:01:16] that what about stubble less than that
[1:01:18] but it would simply refine the goal it
[1:01:22] would refine the silver so you know
[1:01:25] there's one thing about many of the gems
[1:01:27] that are dug up out of the earth now
[1:01:29] they know there's one very unique one
[1:01:31] that does not come out of the Earth but
[1:01:34] it actually comes from a little
[1:01:36] secreture and it is caused by an
[1:01:40] irritant that gets inside of its little
[1:01:42] shell it can be a sand it can be a
[1:01:44] little Burr it can be many different
[1:01:46] things it's an oyster you know that and
[1:01:49] it will start secreting this thing
[1:01:51] inside of his body to be able to envelop
[1:01:54] this and make a pearl but do you know
[1:01:57] that pearls cannot be cut
[1:02:00] do you know that pearls are not like
[1:02:02] diamonds they're not like sardonyx
[1:02:05] they're not like all types topaz and all
[1:02:07] of that no they're not to be cut they
[1:02:10] are to be taken in the shape they are
[1:02:12] and then they will set them according to
[1:02:16] the shape that they bear I want you to
[1:02:18] notice I wonder why the Lord God is
[1:02:21] making the great Gates out of the city
[1:02:23] that we're going to enter into making
[1:02:26] them out of pearls and every several
[1:02:29] gate was a pearl now I read it to you
[1:02:32] here Sunday that God said blessed are
[1:02:35] they that obey his Commandments that
[1:02:37] they may have a right to the tree of
[1:02:38] life but it didn't get to the last part
[1:02:41] of that verse that said that they may be
[1:02:43] able to enter into the gates through the
[1:02:47] gates what are those Gates Pearl Pearl
[1:02:50] so the Pearl comes to much testing and
[1:02:54] much trials so the bride of Christ is
[1:02:57] not afraid because she does not want to
[1:03:00] present wood hay stubble vanity
[1:03:03] vainglory look at me I'm a great big guy
[1:03:07] I'm this and that and the other that's
[1:03:09] wood hay and stubble
[1:03:11] now I want you to notice about these in
[1:03:14] the category that they're in that the
[1:03:17] gold the silver and the gems are durable
[1:03:21] material so the fire does not destroy
[1:03:26] them they are durable material but look
[1:03:30] at the other they are perishable
[1:03:33] material wood hay stubble all perishable
[1:03:38] I wonder how much time we spend in our
[1:03:40] lives on things that are absolutely
[1:03:43] going to be a now they did one of these
[1:03:45] days
[1:03:46] you see in other words Paul is setting
[1:03:49] forth to us that there's two kinds of
[1:03:52] preachers now mainly whenever he's
[1:03:55] dealing with this you read it and you'll
[1:03:56] you'll see where I'm coming from that
[1:03:58] there are some that are sound they're
[1:04:01] sounds solid gospel preachers on the
[1:04:04] word
[1:04:05] and then there are others they simply
[1:04:07] are not now will they be saved yes so it
[1:04:11] shows us then that these men are of a
[1:04:16] savable substance but they just are not
[1:04:19] having a wholesome Doctrine some of them
[1:04:22] probably not even calling the first
[1:04:23] place but yet he knows to be able to put
[1:04:26] it forth and what is called the
[1:04:28] Touchstone how many knows what a
[1:04:29] touchstone is they would use it for gold
[1:04:31] for silver uh in order to prove if it
[1:04:35] was true gold or not so it is a trial it
[1:04:39] is a touchstone so you're able to check
[1:04:43] and test now so you won't be
[1:04:46] disappointed when you stand before him
[1:04:48] then now all Christianity every
[1:04:51] Christian every child of God here
[1:04:53] tonight is going to stand before the
[1:04:55] Lord at this bema every child of God
[1:04:58] that's here one to every child of God
[1:05:00] that's ever lived on the face of the
[1:05:01] Earth are going to stand before the Lord
[1:05:04] and we're going to walk up to that
[1:05:06] elevated place and when we do we want
[1:05:10] our works to be able to stand how many
[1:05:12] does with all your heart
[1:05:14] so the doctrine of Christ and the truth
[1:05:17] of the Gospel must exceed and in order
[1:05:21] to for us to be identified with that our
[1:05:25] works must be able to stand the fire so
[1:05:28] the test will prove the worse or the
[1:05:33] worthlessness
[1:05:36] of every preacher
[1:05:39] and some preachers will stand there
[1:05:42] and their Works will be worthless
[1:05:47] because it was all about them
[1:05:50] oh they preach Christ they talked about
[1:05:53] him
[1:05:54] but in reality it was all about them
[1:05:59] notice First Corinthians again 3 12. now
[1:06:02] if any man build upon this Foundation
[1:06:04] gold silver precious stones wood hay
[1:06:07] stubble now look with me how that I put
[1:06:11] this together like this so you'll be
[1:06:13] able to see it gold silver precious
[1:06:16] stones
[1:06:17] permanent
[1:06:19] beautiful
[1:06:21] valuable
[1:06:23] hard to obtain
[1:06:25] gold silver precious stones permanent
[1:06:29] beautiful
[1:06:30] valuable
[1:06:32] hard to obtain wood hay stubble
[1:06:37] passing
[1:06:39] temporary
[1:06:40] ordinary even
[1:06:43] ugly
[1:06:44] cheap
[1:06:45] easy to obtain
[1:06:50] and that's the kind of walk many folks
[1:06:52] want with God they want the easiest way
[1:06:55] out just show me how close I can walk to
[1:06:59] the world
[1:07:00] don't exact no more out of me than what
[1:07:03] I've got to do and I'll walk the line
[1:07:06] I'll get as close to the world as I can
[1:07:09] and still be saved
[1:07:11] and you'll lose everything you ever do
[1:07:17] all my
[1:07:19] you see true ministers that are called
[1:07:21] of God they have a desire to dig into
[1:07:28] the scriptures to find those Treasures
[1:07:31] which are hidden there
[1:07:34] now my goodness can you imagine if a lot
[1:07:37] of us had to make our living by going
[1:07:39] out and digging for gold and silver and
[1:07:42] gems we wouldn't know where to start we
[1:07:45] wouldn't know what to look for would we
[1:07:46] would starve to death in two weeks time
[1:07:48] we wouldn't know what to do and yet
[1:07:51] that's exactly the way Paul runs the
[1:07:54] parallel of God called men that will be
[1:07:57] able to stand the test of time and the
[1:08:00] test of the fire at the end time so you
[1:08:04] can find wood hay stubble just about
[1:08:07] everywhere and you don't have to mine
[1:08:09] the stubble you don't have to mine the
[1:08:12] hay and depending on what wood it is you
[1:08:15] don't have to necessarily mind the wood
[1:08:16] but in order to get a quality of gold a
[1:08:21] quality of silver and of the gems it
[1:08:24] will take work it will take substantial
[1:08:28] work and investment in order to reach
[1:08:31] down in there and be able to bring a
[1:08:34] nugget out of of God's word and every
[1:08:36] man of God gets that out in his own way
[1:08:38] and his own gift and he will polish that
[1:08:41] thing before the people and my how he
[1:08:44] takes that and rubs it over and over now
[1:08:46] some men are called him and they come
[1:08:47] out my it's like they bring out a whole
[1:08:49] wheelbarrow load of stuff other brothers
[1:08:52] they may not be gifted like that but
[1:08:53] what they bring out it's as polished
[1:08:56] just as much as the man who brought out
[1:08:57] a wall a whole wheelbarrow boat but
[1:08:59] because they've done their very best
[1:09:01] they did not throw a sermon together
[1:09:03] they did not just get by on Sunday
[1:09:06] morning well praise God it's over let's
[1:09:09] get the tithes and go home shame on any
[1:09:11] preacher that has that kind of attitude
[1:09:15] not even fit to pack a Bible
[1:09:17] lazy preachers and lazy Sunday school
[1:09:21] teachers will have much to answer for at
[1:09:26] the bema of God
[1:09:30] well praise the Lord I guess if some of
[1:09:33] y'all knew I was preaching this you'd
[1:09:34] have probably had a headache tonight
[1:09:35] wouldn't you
[1:09:36] well my back's hurting me a little bit
[1:09:38] well it might not been for it come in
[1:09:40] but it may be the time you leave
[1:09:42] notice in verse 13 how he says every
[1:09:45] man's word shall be made manifest for
[1:09:49] the day notice the word he uses the day
[1:09:53] the day itself shall prove it you
[1:09:57] understand the day we're in now in
[1:09:59] Luther's day Luther's day proved what
[1:10:03] men were of God and which ones were not
[1:10:07] now there was some that came out after
[1:10:10] Luther started the Reformation
[1:10:13] but they were more of a detriment to the
[1:10:17] Reformation than they were a help
[1:10:19] and they actually became part of the
[1:10:23] cause of the persecution and they
[1:10:25] brought brought great reproach on the
[1:10:28] message of that day do you know that
[1:10:29] that the historians that wrote in the
[1:10:32] time of the first century uh many of you
[1:10:34] that remember reading in your Bible when
[1:10:37] Claudius the emperor of Rome and he
[1:10:40] abandoned all the Jews out of Rome but
[1:10:43] yet two of the noted Roman historians
[1:10:45] say equivalent Priscilla of course were
[1:10:47] had Roman citizenship and they were
[1:10:50] forced to leave Rome and no Jews could
[1:10:52] go back into Rome but it was not just
[1:10:56] because they were Jews alone but one of
[1:10:59] the noted historians said that the
[1:11:01] followers of Christus which is Christ
[1:11:04] the followers of Christus were so
[1:11:09] divided and arguing and fussing and
[1:11:13] debating over which one was right and
[1:11:16] which one was wrong that Claudius got so
[1:11:19] sick of it that he banned them and made
[1:11:23] them leave
[1:11:24] do you understand that when Paul got
[1:11:26] ready to go to Rome that some of these
[1:11:30] wood preachers stubble preachers hey
[1:11:33] preachers had went in front of Paul and
[1:11:37] when he got there to Rome he only had a
[1:11:40] handful of people that even showed up to
[1:11:43] hear him
[1:11:44] the church AIDS messenger can you
[1:11:47] imagine so it was not Claudius that did
[1:11:50] that it was not later on the different
[1:11:53] Caesar's Nero in them that did it but it
[1:11:55] was actually some of the preachers
[1:11:58] around the message that Jesus was the
[1:12:01] son of God
[1:12:03] and they had went in before Paul and
[1:12:06] poisoned his influence my goodness sakes
[1:12:11] notice this so he says every man's work
[1:12:15] shall be made manifest so in other words
[1:12:17] the real nature of the work either the
[1:12:21] worse or the worthlessness of each man's
[1:12:26] work will be made known so some of the
[1:12:30] builders work well absolutely vanish
[1:12:36] so you imagine men that will stand there
[1:12:38] and they've given Decades of their life
[1:12:41] they think
[1:12:42] to building on the kingdom of God and
[1:12:45] they will stand there and their hands
[1:12:48] will be totally empty
[1:12:50] they will have nothing
[1:12:53] nothing
[1:12:55] because they built it on an Ideal or a
[1:12:59] theological this and that and the other
[1:13:01] are an arrogance the reason they
[1:13:03] preached was to get at another man
[1:13:08] and they will stand before God with
[1:13:10] nothing as if though they just got saved
[1:13:17] Lord Jesus help us
[1:13:21] Philippians chapter 1 verse 15.
[1:13:25] some
[1:13:27] indeed preach Christ
[1:13:31] even of envy
[1:13:34] and strife
[1:13:37] so you imagine preachers in the first
[1:13:39] century and these guys many of them they
[1:13:42] knew they could lose their head
[1:13:46] Rome did not know the difference between
[1:13:48] elect and non-elect but when Romans hear
[1:13:51] a guy preaching about Christians as far
[1:13:53] as they was concerned they was all one
[1:13:55] big group
[1:13:57] these guys could have got killed
[1:13:59] for what they were doing and yet Paul
[1:14:02] said they were preaching Christ for Envy
[1:14:06] or strife
[1:14:09] only because they love to argue and they
[1:14:13] become a preacher
[1:14:16] they they had to be something missing up
[1:14:19] here
[1:14:20] I mean a whole load
[1:14:23] some indeed preach Christ
[1:14:26] even of Envy oh my goodness I'll tell
[1:14:30] you a friend I read this yesterday and
[1:14:32] it just it just staggered me
[1:14:34] Sr I thought God how could how could men
[1:14:38] do this why would they subject
[1:14:41] themselves that everything that goes
[1:14:43] with being a preacher and their motive
[1:14:45] is simply Envy or Strife so the only
[1:14:49] reason they preach is to argue and
[1:14:52] debate and fuss
[1:14:55] or because they're envious of a god call
[1:14:58] man
[1:15:01] you see the motives of all preachers
[1:15:04] are not pure
[1:15:07] oh my goodness
[1:15:09] some preach him For the Love of strife
[1:15:14] others endeavoring to draw people after
[1:15:19] themself
[1:15:21] because they look and they're saying wow
[1:15:24] I wish I was there I wish I was like
[1:15:26] that I was this then that the other mama
[1:15:30] can you imagine many of that have
[1:15:32] preached and cry
[1:15:34] and cry name will suffer Christ's
[1:15:38] judgment
[1:15:39] at the end timer
[1:15:49] because the Lord Jesus does not just
[1:15:51] look at a man's ability to preach
[1:15:54] as I saw a YouTube video of one
[1:15:57] that used to preach
[1:16:02] could say great things
[1:16:05] but someone had sent me a video not long
[1:16:07] ago of him
[1:16:08] standing at a bar
[1:16:10] mixing drinks and alcohol
[1:16:13] telling people how to serve this type of
[1:16:15] drink
[1:16:19] I pray God takes me out of this Earth
[1:16:22] before I ever bring in reproach on our
[1:16:24] lord Jesus
[1:16:27] friends this is serious
[1:16:33] I found this amazing I want you to
[1:16:35] notice this quote with me in the
[1:16:36] influence of another
[1:16:38] when you're playing a ball game
[1:16:40] as it's football season
[1:16:42] I just found that as amazing I thought I
[1:16:44] wanted a thought brother around him even
[1:16:46] a new one football season even was
[1:16:48] up you learned something don't you that
[1:16:51] is if you can learn something so when
[1:16:53] you're playing a ball game as it's
[1:16:55] football season the thing we want to do
[1:16:58] is not everybody try to take the ball
[1:17:01] away from the man that's got it
[1:17:05] now listen it's just simple but
[1:17:07] spiritual analogy it's trying to guard
[1:17:11] that man
[1:17:13] protect him let him get through we're
[1:17:18] trying to make a goal I want you to
[1:17:21] notice how the prophet is facing it here
[1:17:23] so say uh God calls a certain man to say
[1:17:27] we'll say Paul and Luther and we'll see
[1:17:29] it and brother Branham and all them
[1:17:31] great men
[1:17:32] to do only what they could do
[1:17:35] and there was countless of men around
[1:17:37] them that tried to take the ball out of
[1:17:40] their hands and said you're not good
[1:17:42] enough to be a prophet you're not smart
[1:17:45] enough you only got a seventh grade
[1:17:46] education and you didn't have this and
[1:17:49] that and the other so what they do they
[1:17:51] instead of playing guard and trying to
[1:17:54] guard the man that God called they run
[1:17:57] over and try to take the ball away from
[1:17:59] him
[1:18:01] praise the Lord now don't some of y'all
[1:18:04] go looking now and getting your mind on
[1:18:06] the San Francisco 49ers or whoever else
[1:18:09] you're tonight we're talking about a
[1:18:10] different ball game so stay here with me
[1:18:12] notice he said protect him let him get
[1:18:16] through we're trying notice how he says
[1:18:18] it he doesn't say this man but we are
[1:18:22] we're trying to make a goal see because
[1:18:26] you imagine a t here's our problem so
[1:18:29] so untrained a team so untrained as to
[1:18:35] find one man their own man was the ball
[1:18:38] running to the field goal and then
[1:18:40] instead of trying to knock the enemy
[1:18:42] away from him the opposing team to let
[1:18:46] your own man that's got the ball take
[1:18:48] off with that every man trying to take
[1:18:51] the ball out of his hand
[1:18:55] so we're supposed to be on the same side
[1:18:58] and God will Elevate whoever he wants to
[1:19:01] and use whoever he wants to but some
[1:19:04] people think it's not enough glory for
[1:19:06] them to be able to be a guard they think
[1:19:09] it ain't enough Glory because they want
[1:19:11] to make a touchdown well if you're on
[1:19:13] the same team and that skinny man makes
[1:19:16] a touchdown it's still a touchdown
[1:19:18] before you too because you're on the
[1:19:21] same side you're on the same team
[1:19:25] but you know it is everybody wants to be
[1:19:28] the man in the Limelight everybody wants
[1:19:31] to be the man with it makes the
[1:19:33] touchdown oh my goodness can you imagine
[1:19:35] the prophet of God using such an analogy
[1:19:39] I'm glad he did I think it's a great
[1:19:40] analogy myself he said notice what will
[1:19:43] happen now he said the opposing team to
[1:19:46] let your own man that's got the ball
[1:19:47] take off with it every man trying to
[1:19:49] take the ball out of his hand while
[1:19:51] you're bound to lose
[1:19:54] and today we have the same thing when we
[1:19:56] see God come on the scene going to bless
[1:19:58] a certain thing let's keep all the
[1:20:00] enemies away from it let's use our
[1:20:05] influences
[1:20:07] as tackles
[1:20:09] not runners
[1:20:14] so let me ask every one of your
[1:20:15] preachers here tonight what are you
[1:20:17] going to use your influence for
[1:20:22] you see some preachers can't stand it
[1:20:24] they have to be a runner
[1:20:28] but if everybody's a runner who's going
[1:20:31] to block I don't know too much about
[1:20:33] sports I never did really get into it
[1:20:35] that much but I do know enough about it
[1:20:38] I used to watch it some Manhattan
[1:20:39] whenever we was kids and we played it a
[1:20:40] little bit but most of the time I always
[1:20:42] beat him and Harry was a sore loser
[1:20:47] my goodness would you stand out in the
[1:20:49] back and play basketball and we didn't
[1:20:50] have her in no good ball or no nothing
[1:20:52] else either we're just taking no rim or
[1:20:54] whatever and put up there and I'd send
[1:20:55] us older than Harry I was bigger than
[1:20:57] him so I just stand there and put it in
[1:20:59] put it in her and get some Mad Head cry
[1:21:00] you know that little saintly brother
[1:21:02] that plays that organ
[1:21:04] hahaha
[1:21:06] but you see the prophet in using this
[1:21:09] you get in your mind and he understands
[1:21:10] what he's saying so what if everybody on
[1:21:13] you know whatever it is Tennessee I
[1:21:15] suppose got a team what's the name of it
[1:21:17] somebody tell me
[1:21:19] what volunteers some of you sitting
[1:21:22] there are sacrilegious as you can be
[1:21:23] you'd act like you don't want me to know
[1:21:26] that you know that
[1:21:27] my goodness why do you think I figured
[1:21:30] them orange Blazers aren't orange
[1:21:31] t-shirts and orange ball shoes you all
[1:21:34] wear
[1:21:36] it ain't cause you're trying to be an
[1:21:38] orange tree
[1:21:40] [Laughter]
[1:21:42] but can you imagine what everybody would
[1:21:44] say so you tease it sits right to the
[1:21:47] final play or whatever it is and the
[1:21:49] main guy he throws the quarterback
[1:21:51] Frozen and there's a guy that's a wide
[1:21:53] receiver and he takes off running down
[1:21:55] through the or if he gets a touchdown
[1:21:57] he's going to beat Ole Miss or he's
[1:21:59] going to beat Alabama or whoever it is
[1:22:01] and somebody on his own team puts his
[1:22:04] foot out in front of him and trips him
[1:22:06] and takes the ball away from him and
[1:22:09] gives the other side enough time to
[1:22:12] knock the man down
[1:22:14] can you imagine what you Tennessee fans
[1:22:17] would say you wouldn't be booing Alabama
[1:22:20] you wouldn't be booing Ole Miss or
[1:22:23] whoever more you'd be looking for that
[1:22:25] old boy you'd want to give him a piece
[1:22:27] of your mind and maybe I'm not going to
[1:22:28] sandwich along with it you'll say what
[1:22:30] in the world is the matter with you boy
[1:22:32] he was going right down to there and
[1:22:34] can't you understand that people will do
[1:22:37] the same thing in the Church of the
[1:22:39] Living God and preachers have done this
[1:22:42] ever since God had preachers and they
[1:22:44] will do it right on down through time
[1:22:46] but I say whoever God's give the ball to
[1:22:50] Let's guard it let's protect it let's
[1:22:53] get behind what's God's doing God called
[1:22:56] the little guy from down in Kentucky and
[1:22:59] the world life got him and made fun of
[1:23:01] him but I say we give our life for this
[1:23:04] Lord Jesus and we stand behind this
[1:23:07] message of Malachi 4. let's guard it
[1:23:10] from the world let's guard it from the
[1:23:12] ungodly let's guard it from the evil
[1:23:15] let's guard it from the wicked
[1:23:17] Hallelujah will not all be a prophet
[1:23:19] we'll not all be a pastor but somebody's
[1:23:23] got a guard
[1:23:31] oh my let's use our influence as tackles
[1:23:36] not runners
[1:23:38] tackles that protects the runner let him
[1:23:43] pack the ball through because there's no
[1:23:46] opposition
[1:23:48] you can see why Satan wants to do this
[1:23:51] how many preachers down through time
[1:23:52] they did was Paul when Paul was there
[1:23:55] they was trying to take the ball away
[1:23:57] from him don't you understand when Paul
[1:23:58] was in prison these men were out there
[1:24:01] the judaizers they were out there
[1:24:03] preaching and Paul said you've looked at
[1:24:06] my bonds and he said it was further
[1:24:08] furthest of the Gospel you know why when
[1:24:10] Paul was in the Roman prison part of the
[1:24:13] praetorian Guard got a new birth
[1:24:15] hallelujah amen that was Paul wrote down
[1:24:19] the Roman jail but there must have been
[1:24:21] some seed down there God said Paul of
[1:24:23] God I had to make it a little bit hard
[1:24:25] on you for a while but I've got an old
[1:24:27] boy send a little bible the Romans hat
[1:24:28] on I've got another old boy sending over
[1:24:31] there and they're part of the praetorian
[1:24:32] God but they actually belong in my army
[1:24:35] they belong as part of my word go down
[1:24:38] there and get them Paul
[1:24:40] and what did these guys do they took
[1:24:42] advantage of Paul being in jail and they
[1:24:44] went from every Church they could and so
[1:24:46] Discord
[1:24:51] why they wanted the ball
[1:24:54] they want to take it out of Paul's hands
[1:24:56] let me do it let me do it let me make
[1:24:58] the let me make the touchdown let me
[1:25:00] make the Home Run let me do that let me
[1:25:01] do this
[1:25:02] do you understand them same men will
[1:25:04] stand before the Lord Jesus one day
[1:25:07] and give an account
[1:25:10] all my I hope they're not lost I don't
[1:25:12] know only God knows that
[1:25:14] notice this let him pack the boxer
[1:25:17] because there's no opposition all you
[1:25:19] have to do is just keep running
[1:25:21] we should be tackles
[1:25:27] in this football game even sisters can
[1:25:30] be tackles
[1:25:35] get down on them knees and pray for the
[1:25:38] men of God on this age you can get out
[1:25:41] on them knees and call out the names of
[1:25:43] the men of God and Tackle every
[1:25:45] discouraging thing that tries to come
[1:25:47] against them every Spirit of division
[1:25:49] every Spirit of whatever more that will
[1:25:51] try to drive the men of God why if Satan
[1:25:54] cannot get the man himself in sin he'll
[1:25:56] try to get the man so discouraged you
[1:25:58] think what's the use even try people are
[1:26:00] going to do what they want to do anyway
[1:26:01] you preach wholeness and they live the
[1:26:03] way they want to live but God still got
[1:26:05] some men they said I've got this ball
[1:26:07] and I'm going to make a touchdown
[1:26:09] because if I can make one as the pastor
[1:26:12] of your church it will cause the coming
[1:26:15] of the Lord oh don't sit there look at
[1:26:17] me funny I'll read it to you here in a
[1:26:19] minute whenever God's men around the
[1:26:22] world whether they're evangelists or
[1:26:24] teachers or pastors if they can bring
[1:26:26] the bride to that place so where we can
[1:26:28] make one touchdown after another after
[1:26:31] another it will cause the rapture
[1:26:34] I don't blame the devil for trying to
[1:26:37] stop us
[1:26:40] oh man listen again he says listen it's
[1:26:44] like a ball game somebody at a football
[1:26:46] game somebody gets the ball
[1:26:48] every one of his own players
[1:26:51] try and take the ball right away from
[1:26:54] him you can't win the game
[1:26:57] be a guard guard the ball not to try to
[1:27:01] take it away from the next man again he
[1:27:04] says doors and don't enough you try to
[1:27:06] take the ball away from your own man
[1:27:08] you're messing up your team
[1:27:11] the devil don't have to have to do a
[1:27:14] whole lot of this stuff to us we do it
[1:27:15] ourselves
[1:27:19] guard your man see keep guarding him
[1:27:23] keep the rest of them so he can make the
[1:27:27] Run
[1:27:28] and we'll have the touchdown after a
[1:27:30] while and Jesus Will Come
[1:27:34] oh my goodness so when we make the final
[1:27:37] touchdown Jesus will come I wonder how
[1:27:41] close we are we made some touchdowns
[1:27:43] down in Louisiana we'll make some the
[1:27:46] rest of the year in different meetings
[1:27:47] and things that are going on I don't
[1:27:49] think we have to wait for a special
[1:27:50] meeting I believe we have special
[1:27:51] meeting right here
[1:27:53] I don't think wet while our useful go
[1:27:55] over here and they'll get charged up and
[1:27:56] revive I think we ought to have enough
[1:27:58] Revival inside of us well he we could
[1:28:01] have Revival on Wednesday night and on
[1:28:03] Sunday morning and when we start church
[1:28:05] back on Saturday night I ain't waiting
[1:28:07] until brother Ron's special meeting in
[1:28:09] September I wait until some other
[1:28:11] meeting in October I want tonight to be
[1:28:14] a special meeting I want tonight to be a
[1:28:17] special service and we'll get behind
[1:28:19] God's men that's packing the ball and
[1:28:21] we'll stand right there and say oh no
[1:28:23] devil you devil of discouragement I want
[1:28:25] to encourage my pastor I want to
[1:28:28] encourage the Evangelist I'm going to
[1:28:30] stand between him I'm discouragement I'm
[1:28:32] going to stand between him I'm going to
[1:28:34] pray I'm going to ask God to strengthen
[1:28:37] it
[1:28:45] oh my
[1:28:46] notice this in Philippians 1 16 Paul
[1:28:49] says the one
[1:28:52] preached Christ
[1:28:54] of contention
[1:28:58] not
[1:28:59] sincerely
[1:29:02] it's staggering it's staggering
[1:29:06] you mean a man would preach Christ
[1:29:11] but of contention
[1:29:13] look at this word what it means
[1:29:15] electioneering
[1:29:18] or intriguing
[1:29:19] for office
[1:29:21] ah
[1:29:23] so this picture is a politician
[1:29:27] don't you understand he's a
[1:29:29] lectioneering so it's like he's running
[1:29:31] for president
[1:29:33] we've got some preachers this is about
[1:29:35] as bad off as our president is now
[1:29:37] go ahead brother Don I Democrat and
[1:29:40] Republican song blast both sides
[1:29:42] everybody that's rotten
[1:29:44] [Applause]
[1:29:45] it's bad
[1:29:47] if when it's in our nation what what's
[1:29:49] even more sickening is when you see it
[1:29:52] in the message when you see it among
[1:29:54] preachers that preachers are like
[1:29:57] electioneers running for governor or
[1:30:00] vice president or president
[1:30:04] well praise the Lord
[1:30:07] Carol honey we might need to pack our
[1:30:09] stuff they may vote us out of here for
[1:30:10] Sunday
[1:30:15] the one preached Christ of contention
[1:30:19] electioneering or intriguing for office
[1:30:23] a desire
[1:30:25] to put oneself
[1:30:28] forward
[1:30:34] so Paul dealt with that in his day yep
[1:30:37] you know as I begin to read and study
[1:30:38] this I I said it out yesterday as I sat
[1:30:40] in our downstairs studying and I said it
[1:30:42] said it out loud more people ain't
[1:30:44] changed much have the Lord hear the word
[1:30:46] two thousand years ago and you got the
[1:30:48] same thing going on this day we're
[1:30:49] living in
[1:30:50] so the one preached Christ of contention
[1:30:54] not sincerely
[1:30:57] goodness
[1:30:58] supposing to add affliction
[1:31:03] to my bonds
[1:31:06] so some preachers would preach to make
[1:31:10] it harder on other preachers
[1:31:13] they would start a work or a Ministry
[1:31:16] whatever they wish to call it for the
[1:31:18] intent and the purpose of making it
[1:31:22] harder on a successful god-called man
[1:31:28] huh
[1:31:29] y'all didn't know this is in your Bible
[1:31:32] what are they doing lying politicians
[1:31:37] how can we imagine anyone
[1:31:41] in the days of Paul that would have done
[1:31:43] this can you imagine by the gym as I
[1:31:46] said and read this I thought Lord how is
[1:31:48] that possible a great anointed servant
[1:31:51] of God like Paul and they would actually
[1:31:54] do this to make it harder on him so he's
[1:31:57] in jail now when he's writing this book
[1:31:59] of Philippians and they are actually
[1:32:01] going out from church to church and so
[1:32:04] on Discord and this and that and the
[1:32:05] other I'm trying to ruin Paul's
[1:32:08] influence among the people and the sad
[1:32:10] part about it is some of the sheep in
[1:32:12] them day listen to it
[1:32:16] can you imagine she sat in there that
[1:32:20] word begotten by Paul's Ministry these
[1:32:22] men did not have the power of begeto
[1:32:26] they could not produce new births
[1:32:31] of all and some of these people Paul
[1:32:34] birthed him
[1:32:35] and they walked right away from him
[1:32:40] by who politicians
[1:32:43] football players
[1:32:46] spiritual football players that could
[1:32:48] stand up and run
[1:32:53] well look at them muscle man yeah look
[1:32:54] at them things look at their muscle man
[1:32:57] alive look at them leg muscles wow look
[1:32:59] at that physique look at that we should
[1:33:00] pull that guy I'm telling you what he
[1:33:02] can throw a ball I'm telling you he can
[1:33:04] run he can do this but you can't see in
[1:33:07] his heart
[1:33:08] in his heart he's got a motive
[1:33:14] and God's Gonna fire
[1:33:16] for his work
[1:33:23] oh mama
[1:33:25] you see Paul's name
[1:33:27] was to get people to Jesus
[1:33:30] and to glorify the kingdom of God
[1:33:34] but these guys
[1:33:35] were to get people to follow them
[1:33:39] they were not sincere
[1:33:41] and they were doing it for a motive to
[1:33:44] make it harder on Paul when he got out
[1:33:46] and they did
[1:33:48] these men succeeded and when Paul did
[1:33:51] get out he had to go behind them and
[1:33:53] straighten up all of this mess that
[1:33:55] these men had caused
[1:33:58] wow
[1:34:01] my goodness
[1:34:03] so they wanted to make Paul feel
[1:34:06] helpless
[1:34:08] he's imprisoned by the John he can't get
[1:34:10] out he can only send out a letter every
[1:34:12] now and then it don't hardly have any
[1:34:13] contacts because a lot of the Roman
[1:34:15] Christians had left him
[1:34:18] and would have nothing to do with it but
[1:34:20] it was under his ministry that they got
[1:34:22] the Holy Ghost
[1:34:24] God have mercy
[1:34:28] Shake us Lord
[1:34:30] open our eyes
[1:34:32] oh my goodness
[1:34:35] notice in verse 17.
[1:34:38] but the other of love now it said some
[1:34:40] men preached Christ of contention and
[1:34:42] all that but the other of love knowing
[1:34:45] now the men the true men of God this is
[1:34:47] what they knew knowing that I am set for
[1:34:52] the defense of the Gospel what then why
[1:34:56] don't you listen to this first
[1:34:59] notwithstanding every way
[1:35:02] whether in pretense
[1:35:05] or in truth Christ
[1:35:09] preached
[1:35:12] my goodness
[1:35:14] how could this man say this
[1:35:19] notice whether in pretense which is a
[1:35:22] cloak or a show or a pretended cause
[1:35:27] under color as though they would do
[1:35:31] something
[1:35:32] so Paul said even though some of these
[1:35:34] guys are as false as they can be
[1:35:37] but I want you to notice the key word
[1:35:39] here he said they are at least telling
[1:35:42] somebody that Jesus come
[1:35:46] so instead of Paul send down a feeling
[1:35:48] so sorry for yourself pulling on me here
[1:35:50] I am down in this Romans jail Lord don't
[1:35:52] you love me no more well what in the
[1:35:54] world am I doing down here he said glory
[1:35:55] to God them guys out there blasting me
[1:35:58] and they're doing this and that and the
[1:35:59] other but they'll get up there and they
[1:36:01] may some say something about the Messiah
[1:36:02] and there's a predestinated seat sitting
[1:36:05] out there that say Messiah you mean it's
[1:36:07] already here say no it's already come
[1:36:08] well glory to God he said Hallelujah I
[1:36:11] rejoice
[1:36:13] you're rejoice
[1:36:15] don't you see he loved Jesus so much
[1:36:18] Hallelujah he loved Christ Jesus so much
[1:36:23] that he laid his own personal suffering
[1:36:26] to the side and said maybe one of them
[1:36:28] will hear enough about the name of Jesus
[1:36:31] Christ and it'll draw a seed to God
[1:36:33] [Applause]
[1:36:39] notwithstanding
[1:36:41] in every way
[1:36:43] whether in pretense or in truth
[1:36:48] Christ
[1:36:50] is preached
[1:36:52] I then
[1:36:54] do rejoice
[1:36:56] yay I will rejoice
[1:37:00] you imagine the people said they're
[1:37:02] looking at him like y'all look at him he
[1:37:04] said what what do you mean in my name is
[1:37:06] he was actually glad they were preaching
[1:37:07] pretense no he was glad they at least
[1:37:10] had to mention the name of Jesus some of
[1:37:14] you started out as a Baptist some of you
[1:37:16] started out maybe it's the Church of
[1:37:17] Christ or something else and they had to
[1:37:19] preach what at least a little bit about
[1:37:21] Jesus and it woke something inside of
[1:37:24] you a search that started and it wound
[1:37:26] up in the revealed word of the hour so
[1:37:28] Paul said I Rejoice because they're at
[1:37:31] least telling somebody the Messiah has
[1:37:33] come Christ has come
[1:37:37] but can you imagine how these men that
[1:37:39] did this they will stand before the Lord
[1:37:41] Jesus and their Works will be totally
[1:37:45] devoured
[1:37:47] and annihilated
[1:37:51] oh my
[1:37:53] gonna go a little farther
[1:37:56] First Corinthians again 3 13.
[1:37:58] Paul let me say this Paul would not
[1:38:01] allow himself
[1:38:03] to be vexed
[1:38:05] by the bitterness
[1:38:07] of their party Spirit you see it was a
[1:38:10] party and there's dividing himself
[1:38:12] that's what it was so that's what we've
[1:38:13] been dealing with for years and years
[1:38:14] around the message the two Soul party
[1:38:16] and the Seven Thunders and the return
[1:38:18] and all this and that and the other it's
[1:38:20] a party spirit Spirit of denomination
[1:38:22] and it divides God's people and it's of
[1:38:25] the devil
[1:38:26] but Paul refused to be identified in any
[1:38:29] of that and become bitter and and but
[1:38:32] wound up I'll tell one thing I've got
[1:38:34] this old rotten sorry that he said I
[1:38:36] ain't doing it glory to God he said to
[1:38:38] one of them guys to go up and say
[1:38:40] something about Jesus maybe there'll be
[1:38:41] a seed sign out there say Jesus what's
[1:38:43] what's Jesus who's Jesus Paul said I
[1:38:45] Rejoice I rejoice and at least he's
[1:38:47] talking about that boy you talking about
[1:38:49] something if we would get our priorities
[1:38:51] right instead of feeling so sorry for
[1:38:53] ourselves well I'll go through this and
[1:38:55] I'll go through that and I don't
[1:38:57] understand this but what if God let it
[1:38:59] happen to you the way that Paul said it
[1:39:01] has happened to me in defense of the
[1:39:03] gospel and Paul went on to say some of
[1:39:05] them had preached Christ's a vanity and
[1:39:07] of strife but he said others got stirred
[1:39:10] up because I strolled in jail they're
[1:39:12] some of them brothers that was called to
[1:39:13] be preachers and yet they kind of took a
[1:39:16] back seat and was sitting around but
[1:39:17] Paul said when they throwed they sold me
[1:39:19] in jail them brothers got a hold to
[1:39:22] something and God got a hold of some of
[1:39:24] the praetorian guards and God also so
[1:39:26] God will hold to some of his other men
[1:39:28] because they looked at Paul and said
[1:39:30] that man of God can be persecuted he can
[1:39:33] be like that talked about he don't even
[1:39:35] slow him down he keeps right on
[1:39:37] preaching right on loving Jesus oh give
[1:39:40] us more men of God like that that can be
[1:39:43] hated despised and rejected but they are
[1:39:47] so in love with Jesus Christ they
[1:39:49] Rejoice that Christ is preached
[1:39:56] foreign
[1:39:57] oh my
[1:40:00] God you see Paul
[1:40:02] refers to this about the fire
[1:40:05] Every Man's work shall be made manifest
[1:40:08] for the day shall declare it because it
[1:40:10] shall be revealed by fire and the fire
[1:40:13] shall try every man's work
[1:40:15] of what sort it is
[1:40:19] the power of fire to try
[1:40:23] is symbolized in the Old Testament
[1:40:26] read with me Isaiah 4 4 when the Lord
[1:40:29] shall have washed away
[1:40:32] the filth of the daughters of Zion
[1:40:35] and shall have purged the blood of
[1:40:37] Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the
[1:40:40] spirit of judgment
[1:40:42] and by the spirit of burning fire so
[1:40:47] fire then is used as a symbol of purging
[1:40:52] manifesting something I said 24 15.
[1:40:54] wherefore glorify ye the Lord in the
[1:40:58] fires
[1:40:59] even the name of the Lord God of Israel
[1:41:02] and the owls of the city so God wants us
[1:41:05] to glorify his name when we are in the
[1:41:08] fire well come on it's easy to do it
[1:41:11] when you're on the beach side and
[1:41:12] everything's cooling you got a big glass
[1:41:13] of iced tea sitting there by you it's a
[1:41:15] little bit harder to do and you're out
[1:41:16] in the middle of the burning fire
[1:41:17] somebody say Amen I'll tell you one
[1:41:20] thing we ought to be the copper
[1:41:21] Christians that we'll say yes Lord I
[1:41:23] want this scripture to be mine I'm going
[1:41:24] to glorify you on the fire I'm going to
[1:41:26] glorify you one or don't feel like it
[1:41:27] I'm going to glorify when I'm sick I'm
[1:41:29] going to go find one I'm so weak I can't
[1:41:31] even hardly raise my hand but I'm going
[1:41:32] to bless your name anyhow I'm going to
[1:41:34] praise my way right out of this battle
[1:41:37] notice Malachi 3 2 but who may abide the
[1:41:41] day of his coming and who shall stand
[1:41:44] when he appears for he is like a
[1:41:48] Refiner's Fire like Fuller's Soap
[1:41:51] Matthew 3 12. whose fan is in his hand
[1:41:54] and he will thoroughly Purge his floor
[1:41:56] and gather his Sweden to the Garner but
[1:41:59] he will burn up the chaff with
[1:42:02] unquenchable fire
[1:42:04] so let me move from the preachers now
[1:42:06] for a moment
[1:42:07] to move down to every one of you
[1:42:11] what will your Works be when you stand
[1:42:14] before the bema
[1:42:16] of the Lord Jesus
[1:42:21] now you know already
[1:42:23] that you are not rewarded
[1:42:25] for everything you do for yourself
[1:42:29] boy if we were man alive some of us that
[1:42:32] have some kind of reward with me wow
[1:42:35] do you realize what you do for you
[1:42:38] it's not written in the book of
[1:42:39] remembrance well I bought myself this
[1:42:41] and I bought myself that and I did this
[1:42:43] for me and I did that for me and I did
[1:42:45] that for me and I did that for me
[1:42:46] there's no record of that
[1:42:49] you don't get rewarded for what you do
[1:42:50] for yourself
[1:42:52] but what you do for others
[1:42:54] eternal life is not living for you
[1:42:56] that's human life
[1:42:58] which we all have and was all born with
[1:43:00] that old rotten thing you might as well
[1:43:01] say man because you're just as rotten as
[1:43:03] a pile of dirt
[1:43:04] you stink you're no good you're
[1:43:07] absolutely lost without God you're a hog
[1:43:09] and a pig lock until God gets a hold of
[1:43:11] him then he changes your life and your
[1:43:14] nature and births in your eternal life
[1:43:17] which puts another desire in you to live
[1:43:19] for others and the church said
[1:43:22] First Peter 1 7 that the trial of your
[1:43:24] faith being more precious than that of
[1:43:26] gold that perisheth though it be tried
[1:43:28] with fire that it may be found unto
[1:43:31] praise and honor and the glory at the
[1:43:34] appearing of Jesus Christ so the finds
[1:43:37] end will be used to try individuals the
[1:43:41] fire would be used to try works so the
[1:43:44] day of the Lord is identified in many
[1:43:48] places in the old in the New Testament
[1:43:49] as a bursting light or an illumination
[1:43:53] of fire now notice in verse 14 Paul says
[1:43:57] if any man's work abide which he hath
[1:44:01] built thereon he shall receive a reward
[1:44:04] now if his preaching and his works and
[1:44:07] his practice of the way he lived is
[1:44:11] approved by God then that man will
[1:44:15] receive a reward
[1:44:18] to share in the glory of Christ Jesus
[1:44:22] for eternity is a reward of God's grace
[1:44:27] so what is it it is Wages as a builder
[1:44:32] that every true servant of God now
[1:44:35] remember whether it's a preacher or not
[1:44:36] every true servant of God will God will
[1:44:40] pay you and give you of his goodness for
[1:44:45] your reward remember what the voice said
[1:44:48] to the prophet a huge portion of Heaven
[1:44:51] awaits Thee Well it don't await me and
[1:44:55] it don't await all these other preachers
[1:44:56] around the message why because I don't
[1:44:58] have the responsibility he had and
[1:45:00] neither will I get the rewards that he
[1:45:02] got now realize there's some around the
[1:45:04] message that think they're great or more
[1:45:05] important than brother Branham was and I
[1:45:07] just pray for the feeble-minded because
[1:45:09] that's what the Bible says do yeah
[1:45:11] because they got to be pretty
[1:45:12] feeble-minded if they think they're
[1:45:13] called higher than the prophet of God oh
[1:45:15] yeah they're pretty people I figure
[1:45:16] notice second Corinthians 1 14. as also
[1:45:20] you have acknowledged Us in part that we
[1:45:24] are now notice what you will be to me
[1:45:28] and what we will be to the prophet and
[1:45:33] what all of us the conglomeration of the
[1:45:36] seven Church ages will be to Christ we
[1:45:39] will be to him what Eve was to her man
[1:45:44] her Adam
[1:45:46] the crowning watch this also ye have
[1:45:50] acknowledged Us in part that we are your
[1:45:54] rejoicing even as ye also are ours in
[1:46:00] the day of the Lord Jesus
[1:46:04] so the crowning of my Ministry the
[1:46:08] crowning of every true man of God's
[1:46:10] ministry will be the people he has
[1:46:14] helped and benefited the one side he's
[1:46:18] led to the Lord the prophet said if you
[1:46:20] lead one person to Christ that name is
[1:46:23] identified with you throughout all
[1:46:26] eternity
[1:46:27] so every sermon that every man of God
[1:46:30] has preached and it's been word solid
[1:46:34] word base his motive is right his
[1:46:36] objective is right God gave it to him
[1:46:39] God inspired him that yet God will
[1:46:41] reward that man for studying praying
[1:46:43] delivering it and so on and then the
[1:46:45] people will stand there from wherever
[1:46:47] more and say I was blessed by that I was
[1:46:50] set free by that I this happened to me
[1:46:52] that happened to me what is that that's
[1:46:54] a crowning of that man's Ministry
[1:46:58] now watch again in Philippians chapter 2
[1:47:01] verse 15 that ye may be blameless and
[1:47:05] harmless the sons of God without rebuke
[1:47:09] in the midst of a crooked and perverse
[1:47:12] Nation among whom you shine as lights in
[1:47:15] the world holding Force now right here
[1:47:18] is where I got the name for our church
[1:47:20] holding Force the word of life
[1:47:26] holding Force the word of life
[1:47:30] that I may rejoice in the day of Christ
[1:47:34] that I have not run in vain neither
[1:47:39] labored in vain so now here apollon is
[1:47:43] putting himself in that same place I
[1:47:46] don't want to do all this for nothing I
[1:47:48] don't want to run in vain labor in vain
[1:47:50] or or children can you imagine the
[1:47:52] disappointment when people stand there
[1:47:54] before him and they look around and they
[1:47:56] think oh I've done this and that and the
[1:47:58] other and there's no evidence there's no
[1:48:00] evidence of any of that because their
[1:48:03] whole basis of their Ministry was
[1:48:06] because they wanted to preach their
[1:48:09] daddy said there's going to be a
[1:48:10] preacher their mama said there's going
[1:48:12] to be a preacher let me tell you
[1:48:13] something if God wants you to be a
[1:48:15] preacher God will call you himself
[1:48:17] and if God don't call you you ain't got
[1:48:19] no business getting in the pulpit
[1:48:21] I'm under myself I've wandered down
[1:48:23] through times and I'll keep white on
[1:48:24] wondering how many men are up preaching
[1:48:25] that ain't even called but God in the
[1:48:27] first place it's easy to see a lot of
[1:48:28] them ain't look at how they interpret
[1:48:30] the word look at the mess of me well
[1:48:31] Amen brother Donnie go ahead and preach
[1:48:33] it
[1:48:35] oh my notice first Thessalonians 2 19.
[1:48:39] for what is Our Hope or joy
[1:48:43] oh my goodness
[1:48:45] or crown
[1:48:47] of rejoicing are not even ye
[1:48:53] in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:48:56] and he is coming
[1:48:58] suppose that's and then the question
[1:49:00] don't you know what my crown is it's not
[1:49:02] that I fasted so much and I've done this
[1:49:04] and that and the other my crown my
[1:49:07] crowning of my Ministry and the proof
[1:49:09] that I have not worked in vain is when I
[1:49:12] turn around and I see you all there you
[1:49:15] will Crown my Ministry
[1:49:19] brother random says it that we will be
[1:49:21] the stars in his crown
[1:49:24] so it makes me feel real sorry for them
[1:49:26] who say he's a false prophet because
[1:49:28] they won't be well there ain't no crowns
[1:49:29] nor Stars only fire
[1:49:33] oh that may be a star not in the fire
[1:49:37] praise the Lord for what is Our Hope For
[1:49:40] Joy or crown of rejoicing are not even
[1:49:43] ye
[1:49:44] are not even ye
[1:49:47] in the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:49:50] at his coming or not you my crown
[1:49:54] if we are alive and remain when the Lord
[1:49:57] comes what will be my crown how many
[1:50:00] sermons have preached how many churches
[1:50:03] that I've helped build around the world
[1:50:05] how many things I've done this and that
[1:50:07] and the other no
[1:50:09] you
[1:50:11] so if there is not one soul that stands
[1:50:14] with me
[1:50:15] that has become born again that was
[1:50:18] delivered from darkness that was set
[1:50:21] free there's no proof of what I preached
[1:50:24] that I have to prosely and I've got to
[1:50:27] pull people from this church and from
[1:50:28] that one and that one and that because I
[1:50:29] ain't got no power together Within Me
[1:50:32] if there ain't nobody standing there
[1:50:34] with me it don't mean no difference how
[1:50:36] great you think I've done if there ain't
[1:50:38] nobody with me
[1:50:41] my work will be
[1:50:43] destroyed
[1:50:51] help me God
[1:50:53] help us God
[1:50:59] let me close
[1:51:01] if any man's work
[1:51:05] shall be burned
[1:51:08] he shall suffer
[1:51:10] loss
[1:51:12] look at the word here
[1:51:14] same here
[1:51:16] receive damage
[1:51:19] to effect with damage to sustain damage
[1:51:23] to receive injury
[1:51:25] so the phrase here literally means he
[1:51:28] shall be malucted
[1:51:30] the word is a law term
[1:51:32] that means he shall be fined
[1:51:36] he shall suffer
[1:51:38] detriment
[1:51:41] Lord have mercy children
[1:51:43] we don't want to wait to find this out
[1:51:45] when we stand on the Beamer of God
[1:51:48] if our motives ain't right or objectives
[1:51:49] ain't right let's fix them now
[1:51:53] amen
[1:51:57] he shall suffer loss
[1:52:00] Dear God
[1:52:02] that he himself shall be saved
[1:52:05] yet so
[1:52:07] as by fire
[1:52:09] instead
[1:52:19] oh Jesus
[1:52:23] Hallelujah
[1:52:28] you also said let's not just think about
[1:52:31] preachers well brother Don you know that
[1:52:33] was totally for the preachers no it
[1:52:35] wasn't totally for the preachers it's
[1:52:37] totally for every one of us
[1:52:39] we'll get to it Lord willing next time
[1:52:41] we look at it again but the New
[1:52:43] Testament speaks over and over and over
[1:52:47] and over again about Christians and
[1:52:50] their works not just preachers
[1:52:53] Christians and their works of what you
[1:52:56] do for others what you do for the
[1:52:59] economy of God what you do for the
[1:53:01] church what you do for your brothers and
[1:53:03] sisters whatever it is that God has
[1:53:06] called you to do
[1:53:08] oh my
[1:53:10] let's bury it if you want
[1:53:16] a Heavenly Father
[1:53:19] I feel the same soberness that I felt
[1:53:23] this evening when I was set and studying
[1:53:26] as I set their Lord with my computer in
[1:53:30] my lap and
[1:53:31] just this somber
[1:53:34] awesome
[1:53:35] presence
[1:53:38] I feel the same thing right here now
[1:53:40] Lord
[1:53:42] Dear God
[1:53:45] I don't do anything that I do for reward
[1:53:47] I never have why should I start now
[1:53:51] I don't do it so that you'll say to me
[1:53:54] well done Donnie no you know that you
[1:53:57] know my heart
[1:53:58] I do it because I love your people

[1:54:39] we want to see lives you won't put a
[1:54:42] crown on a tape
[1:54:43] you don't put a crown on a book
[1:54:46] but it'll be on a person

[1:54:50] these individuals those also that are
[1:54:52] streaming Lord

[1:55:02] I do I ain't no preacher I ain't no man
[1:55:06] but they can be able to live their life
[1:55:08] in such a way
[1:55:09] that someone can take notice that
[1:55:12] they're different they don't act like
[1:55:14] the world they don't look like them they
[1:55:16] don't dress like them
[1:55:17] maybe raise a question
[1:55:19] in their heart where do you go to church
[1:55:21] what do you all believe how come you
[1:55:23] dress this way how come you do that then
[1:55:25] they are a Living Word a living epistle

[1:56:00] and now in the sixth year of my 60s
[1:56:04] oh and I don't regret a day of it
[1:56:07] I don't regret one day that I gave you
[1:56:12] oh but Jesus
[1:56:15] help me Lord
[1:56:17] that my work will not be riddled with
[1:56:20] fire
[1:56:22] that I'm not using stubble hey or would
[1:56:27] help me Lord God
[1:56:29] to constantly add gold
[1:56:32] silver precious gems jewels from your
[1:56:35] word then what will it do Lord
[1:56:38] it'll bring a gem or a piece of gold or
[1:56:41] silver from your word your message
[1:56:43] and then impart that into the lives of
[1:56:46] these individuals and then they become
[1:56:48] the jewels themselves
[1:56:50] as they receive that word so as we feed
[1:56:53] on that word we receive the word and we
[1:56:55] become the word
[1:56:57] so then we become the jewels that Jesus
[1:56:59] is coming for

[2:04:11] when our brothers are sitting out these
[2:04:13] chairs
[2:04:14] they've submitted a plan for us to be
[2:04:16] able to set them in such a distance from
[2:04:18] the altar when I come in here looked at
[2:04:19] it I said Brothers
[2:04:20] I don't like where them chairs are I
[2:04:23] want to move back
[2:04:25] because I'm on a bigger altar
[2:04:27] so whenever I feel led in my heart to
[2:04:30] invite as many as the churches wants to
[2:04:32] come up to pray we can have plenty of
[2:04:34] room to pray
[2:04:35] I know most churches don't even have an
[2:04:37] altar no more
[2:04:38] but I believe we need one
[2:04:41] for those of you that like to just take
[2:04:43] a walk just move out of your seat come
[2:04:45] up there ain't room for all of you but
[2:04:47] for those of you that can't stand up
[2:04:48] here and stand down the aisle just come
[2:04:51] up let's just pray let's just have a
[2:04:53] rededication
[2:04:55] of searching by the spirit of God now
[2:04:58] you don't want to just do it alone on
[2:05:00] yourself but you want him to search you
[2:05:03] because our hearts
[2:05:05] unless God's in them
[2:05:07] they'll never be honest with us
[2:05:10] they'll be dishonest and they won't be
[2:05:12] true and they won't want you to see
[2:05:14] yourself as you are
[2:05:16] but as Jeremiah said who can know the
[2:05:18] heart the heart can be such a deceitful
[2:05:21] thing
[2:05:22] but may the spirit of God come
[2:05:25] and I don't have a problem with them
[2:05:27] beginning with me
[2:05:29] let him look at me
[2:05:31] let him look in the storerooms of my
[2:05:33] heart let him look at the building
[2:05:35] material that I have in me let him look
[2:05:39] at the implements that I use for his
[2:05:41] service
[2:05:42] let him look at motive objective
[2:05:44] attitude check me see if there's any
[2:05:47] Envy am I jealous of anybody
[2:05:51] do I have any Strife toward my heart and
[2:05:54] anybody
[2:05:55] did I build this church out of envy
[2:05:59] God knows me and those of you if you
[2:06:01] knew me very well you'd know I hate
[2:06:03] change
[2:06:04] I hate change and I sure hate major
[2:06:07] change if it's been left up to me we'd
[2:06:10] have never never dug the first shovel of
[2:06:12] dirt where we are but I felt like we
[2:06:15] needed to make a move and we needed to
[2:06:17] have a bigger place for more convenience
[2:06:20] for our people
[2:06:22] and that's why I did it don't you don't
[2:06:24] you know and understand
[2:06:26] that God's men have always been men who
[2:06:30] were providers for their people
[2:06:33] brother Raymond Owensboro in 1956
[2:06:35] Senator preaching to a church and they
[2:06:37] built built a church there and brother
[2:06:39] man compliments the pastor and he said
[2:06:41] this brother he said look at your what
[2:06:43] he's done with the money and he said a
[2:06:45] brother this took taking the money that
[2:06:47] you've give and built a nice place for
[2:06:50] you to worship and brother Adam brags
[2:06:52] and brags oh I've got blasted for years
[2:06:55] and years by all these filthy rich
[2:06:57] preachers around the message because
[2:06:59] I've taken ties and built churches
[2:07:02] around the world
[2:07:04] of course they wanted me to do what
[2:07:05] they've done with their ties buy stocks
[2:07:08] and Exxon and BP
[2:07:11] my stocks are on the other side
[2:07:15] so when the stock market crashes it
[2:07:18] don't affect my investments
[2:07:20] I could have been a millionaire friends
[2:07:23] many times over
[2:07:25] many times over
[2:07:28] but why in the world what I want to do
[2:07:30] such a foolish thing is that
[2:07:34] Hallelujah
[2:07:37] may God search our hearts are you
[2:07:39] willing are you scared or are you
[2:07:42] willing will you give him the key to
[2:07:44] every door in your heart and say Lord
[2:07:46] just come right on in
[2:07:48] I ain't got no closets nowhere I ain't
[2:07:51] got nothing hid right here's the key
[2:07:53] ring to every room I've got in my heart
[2:07:54] you can have my wallet you can have my
[2:07:56] heart you can have my house you can have
[2:07:58] the keys to my car you can have
[2:08:00] everything my motives my objectives
[2:08:02] everything about me
[2:08:04] search me Lord
[2:08:06] I do not want to fulfill what I heard
[2:08:08] our pastor preached tonight
[2:08:10] I do not want to stand there that day at
[2:08:13] the bema of Christ Jesus
[2:08:16] and everything burn around me and I'll
[2:08:19] be saved but I'll walk in with no reward
[2:08:23] at all
[2:08:24] Dear God
[2:08:26] let's pray together can we just for each
[2:08:28] other for our family for our our church
[2:08:31] family
[2:08:33] father I know this is such a different
[2:08:35] service than we had here
[2:08:37] last Wednesday night
[2:08:39] the testimonies of the use that then
[2:08:42] Lord you come down in the prayer line
[2:08:43] and oh Father you healed am I you
[2:08:46] delivered folks that was having all
[2:08:48] kinds of issues
[2:08:50] but I believe you've got another thought
[2:08:51] of Deliverance here now Lord
[2:08:54] maybe not a back pain maybe not a pain
[2:08:56] in their foot to here or there but maybe
[2:08:58] they need to go through the storage room
[2:09:00] or their life and maybe they need to
[2:09:02] look at some motives and objectives and
[2:09:04] realize oh yeah they'd give this for God
[2:09:06] and that for God but really they could
[2:09:08] do more Lord look at me search me
[2:09:11] father you see them I'm getting up in
[2:09:14] years now and I I realize I I won't have
[2:09:17] the strength that I had when I was a
[2:09:19] young man
[2:09:20] but God can I do more
[2:09:23] can I give more
[2:09:25] I don't want to be a preacher Lord that
[2:09:27] I just I just give a little bit because
[2:09:30] I use my age as an excuse I'll give you
[2:09:34] every bit that I have you know I've
[2:09:37] never held back one time whether I've
[2:09:39] preached to 10 or 20 or thousands I've
[2:09:42] preached to thousands in one setting and
[2:09:44] Lord I preach the same whether it's a
[2:09:46] handful or a multitude
[2:09:49] Lord begin with me would you look at me
[2:09:52] search me then father I ask you to go
[2:09:55] down to each individual you're tonight
[2:09:57] every man woman boy and girl and don't
[2:10:00] stop here go over the internet go out
[2:10:03] through the father maybe preachers
[2:10:05] sitting there in their home not having a
[2:10:07] Wednesday night service tears running
[2:10:09] out of their eyes and they're saying the
[2:10:11] same thing search me Lord God maybe
[2:10:13] others are archived from Holland and
[2:10:16] from Norway and from Iceland and
[2:10:18] Greenland and wherever around the world
[2:10:20] that they do father God in the name of
[2:10:23] Jesus May you search all of us Lord
[2:10:26] we don't want our works to be destroyed
[2:10:28] and burned father
[2:10:29] but we want to be able to present to you
[2:10:32] something a testimony that we lived on
[2:10:35] the earth and that we served your
[2:10:37] purpose father
[2:10:39] in the name of Jesus I pray for the
[2:10:41] Youth here father that you would help
[2:10:43] them Lord God may they sing
[2:10:46] Lord help them to realize let a little
[2:10:48] group of them get together and go and
[2:10:50] take a guitar and visit some of the
[2:10:52] homebound Lord we've got several on the
[2:10:55] screen out there that cannot come to
[2:10:57] church and they they put it up on the
[2:10:59] screen remember sister so and so
[2:11:00] remember brother so and so maybe they
[2:11:03] can go a few of the time and sing them
[2:11:05] some songs
[2:11:06] take them apart just do a little
[2:11:08] something to reach out to them to let
[2:11:10] them know they're not forgotten that we
[2:11:13] love them oh Lord there's something we
[2:11:16] can all do
[2:11:17] but the sad truth about it is so many of
[2:11:20] us wants to pack the ball
[2:11:22] we want our name and the lights we want
[2:11:24] to stand before the camera and let
[2:11:26] everybody know what we've done
[2:11:28] oh Lord God I don't have to be that
[2:11:31] person
[2:11:32] you know me well enough to know if I
[2:11:34] could and I'd get away with it tonight
[2:11:36] if you'd let me I'd step from behind
[2:11:38] this pulpit and turn this church over to
[2:11:40] another man and I'd retire and I'd step
[2:11:42] back and be able to enjoy the rest of my
[2:11:44] life I don't have to be on the Limelight
[2:11:47] I don't even want to be I wish nobody
[2:11:49] even knew me
[2:11:51] but Lord God what can I do if that's
[2:11:53] what you've called me to be then give me
[2:11:55] courage Lord give me strength I pray
[2:11:57] father to stand and fight Lord if you
[2:12:00] call me to pack the ball help me to pack
[2:12:03] it Lord God I'll go through the defense
[2:12:05] Lord there may be great big guy standing
[2:12:08] in there that's way bigger than I am oh
[2:12:10] I know some of them great old big giants
[2:12:12] that will face the Lord they'll be so
[2:12:14] big and they'll look overwhelming but by
[2:12:17] the grace of God we'll be like that
[2:12:18] little Mexican woman down there we'll go
[2:12:20] over the top of them we'll go between
[2:12:22] their legs we'll jump over and we'll do
[2:12:24] whatever say we've got to do because our
[2:12:26] baby has a need Lord God our desire is
[2:12:30] to serve your father Lord I want to
[2:12:32] please you Hallelujah if it gets so old
[2:12:35] to keep preached Lord God then they may
[2:12:37] roll me out here at least let me scream
[2:12:39] and holler Hallelujah let me say praise
[2:12:42] the Lord let me say glory to God father
[2:12:45] I pray you would help us tonight to have
[2:12:47] a greater determination and a greater
[2:12:49] desire than we've ever had in our life
[2:12:51] father I believe there's a reason for us
[2:12:54] to be relocated here and there may be
[2:12:56] people that will come in I know there's
[2:12:58] already been lots and lots of visitors
[2:13:00] and Lord there may be 500 come through
[2:13:02] but their mom may wind up being one
[2:13:04] that's got a seed it's been wandering
[2:13:06] around out here in drunken parties and
[2:13:09] this and that and the other and you had
[2:13:10] us to do all of this work and all of
[2:13:12] this building for one seed of God and
[2:13:15] when that one comes in we might go home
[2:13:17] in the Rapture it would be worse all
[2:13:19] that we've done father no doubt the last
[2:13:22] seeds that are brought in will be some
[2:13:24] of the most expensive seeds that have
[2:13:27] ever been brought Lord God paying
[2:13:29] internet bills and all this stuff to be
[2:13:31] able to reach it around the world it
[2:13:33] will be the most expensive seed but when
[2:13:36] we consider that one's soul is worth
[2:13:39] millions of Worlds oh hallelujah how how
[2:13:42] great expense could we put out for one
[2:13:45] of your children father then when the
[2:13:47] last one comes in it may be an
[2:13:50] evangelist on the field it may be a
[2:13:52] pastor in his church and he preaches a
[2:13:54] little simple sermon and he makes an
[2:13:56] older call and the last one comes in and
[2:13:59] the pastor will take up the football and
[2:14:01] cross the finish line and there it'll be
[2:14:03] the last one that will make it
[2:14:06] then all of us will get to go home we
[2:14:09] won't be mad because we didn't win the
[2:14:11] last one I don't care if I win them or
[2:14:13] not Lord I don't care who wins them just
[2:14:16] as long as they're one amen we don't
[2:14:19] have to be the one that does it Lord
[2:14:21] Jesus

[2:14:24] great work Gloria

[2:14:29] oh Hallelujah
[2:14:32] can we just raise our hands in the
[2:14:34] presence of the Lord we all know
[2:14:36] raising our hands is a universal sign
[2:14:40] of surrender it means we lay down our
[2:14:43] Armament we lay down our weapons let's
[2:14:46] lay down our weapons out against the
[2:14:48] devil of course but are fighting and our
[2:14:50] warring against God against God and His
