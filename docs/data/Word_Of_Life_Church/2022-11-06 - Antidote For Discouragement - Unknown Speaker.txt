with you a little bit different preaching in the hotel so it's a wee bit nervous but desire your prayers Lord willing Wednesday will be leaving for Poland get there on Thursday I got two services on Friday a service on Saturday two on Sunday one on Monday and fly home on Tuesday so I told him I said I'm not as young as I used to be but but I desire your prayers that we can get there and most importantly we can get back home I certainly appreciate that if you have your Bibles this morning turn with us to the Book of Numbers I'm going to read from Numbers chapter 21 starting at verse 1. like I say we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we counted just an honor to be with you here this morning certainly enjoyed the time that we had hunting last week and just to be out in the woods and see nature and it's just I just love nature and to watch the animals and the leaves and it didn't didn't score any game but we sure had a wonderful time and appreciate brother Daniel allowing us to go with him I want to read now from Numbers chapter 21 starting at version one do you love him yeah I got a little unusual text this morning but we trust the Lord will just help us numbers 21 1 and when the king of the raid the Canaanite which dwelt in the South heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies then he fought against Israel and took some of them prisoners and Israel vowed a vow unto the Lord and said if thou will indeed deliver this people into my hand then I will utterly destroy their cities and the Lord hearken to the voice of Israel and delivered up the Canaanites and they utterly destroyed them and their cities and he called the name of the place hormac and they journeyed from Mount hor by the way of the Red Sea to Compass the land of Eden and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way The Souls of the people was much discouraged because of the way thus power heads I want to speak on that a few minutes this morning if the Lord to help us now I want to speak on this thought of the antidote for discouragement Heavenly Father Lord we are so grateful that we can feel you in our hearts Lord father I know that we don't base these things up on feeling but I do know Lord It's good to feel you and we want to thank you dear God for the opportunity that we've been given as such an hour of Darkness to be your children of light father I pray this morning that you would come Lord and take this thought as we realize Dear God we are living in such a discouraging time but Lord you have given us an antidote for that and so father I pray that you would just help us this morning to get ourself out of the way that you could take this and bring it to your people as you put it up on a heart this week Lord as we was thinking on these things and now Lord I come before you for the needs of our children there's many of them sick Lord and Afflicted and some in the hospital and Lord there are little ones that we love them and I asked your God that you would move and bring them forth well oh God may we take this power of prayer that's been given into our hand may we sling it against the enemy dear God and may he be defeated by the faith that lays within the promises of your word the Lord you see the other needs that are Among Us Lord may you just move for each person today and Lord if they would be some here discouraged may they draw strength from this word today that we may leave Lord that people not discouraged but of people encouraged by the promises of your word bless your people today Lord bless brother Donnie and his family as they travel Lord to rest a few days may you just Comfort them Lord we pray those other needs around us father brother Michael Teagan in the hospital Lord From the accident help our brother Lord we pray and others on our prayer list Dear God but you just move for him Lord that's just the kind of God you are to do these things for us and we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus for thy glory and the Saints said amen may God bless you may be seated amen you know I still believe God squeeze a man's heart and the juice comes out his eyes amen but you know discouraged by definition it means having lost confidence or enthusiasm to be disheartened so discouragement is the condition of being discouraged and Times of discouragement comes to us all of us whether you're a husband or whether you're a wife a man or a woman a boy or a girl a preacher or a lay member a pastor or a prophet discouragement is something that everyone faces not just one time but all through the Journey We have dealt and we will deal with times of discouragement and there's many things that causes discouragement sickness causes discouragement whether it be your own personal sickness or the sickness of a family member that is just day in and day out of dealing with negative reports and dealing with blood work and this and that it brings many times discouragement Hard Times brings discouragement disappointments brings discouragement failures brings discouragement events that happens in our life that we have absolutely no control over brings discouragement when things just don't work out like we thought they should work out many times it brings discouragement but arimp said many times when there's a blessing laying right ahead the devil tries everything he can to discourage us and if you notice it's when you are discouraged that's when the devil can really pour it on you that's when he gets you is when you're discouraged so what does Satan desire for every one of us in this building this morning his desire for us is to be discouraged he don't care if you come to church if you set like you're dead he don't care if you come to church and and paint the barn while you're sitting here he don't care if you come to church and you're so discouraged you can hardly lift up your that's the way he wants you to come he don't want you to come here and encourage you don't want you coming here looking at the promise of God knows that no matter what I face today I serve a god who's able to do something about it amen well when we come through those doors knowing who we are knowing where we come from and knowing where we're going then we have the authority Amen to put Satan down Hallelujah amen it's when you're discouraged that the devil can really pour it on you that's when he gets you if he can get you discouraged then you're disheartened you lose enthusiasm you lose confidence and then you forget the promise you forget the promise as long as you're looking at the symptom you're not seeing the solution as long as you're looking at the problem you're not seeing the answer as long as you're staggering in the darkness you're not enjoying the light so if he can get you discouraged you lose your enthusiasm you're disheartened you lose your confidence oh maybe none of us here will deny that God's A Healer but we lose our confidence that God can heal me the prophet said those discouraging times comes to every believer to test you and try you and see if you really do believe every son that cometh to God must first be tested and child trained there'll be some of you here tonight no doubt we'll go through that same testing times of discouragement amen and that's what we see in our scripture reading this morning a discouraging time came to Israel you see Israel they were on their pilgrimage from the land of Egypt to Canaan and God told them I have already gave you the land not could be not hope so not maybe and I don't know if it'll work or not no God said it's already done and if you can realize this morning in God's thoughts you have already raptured and God's thoughts this morning we have already made it Hallelujah he wrote our name in his book before the foundation of the world why would he do that unless he knew you would be there amen I've already gave you the land that was a promise and God keeps his promise not 99 times out of 100 but 100 times out of the hundred God will keep a promise he's made to his children it's not that God's lacking the promise it's that we get discouraged and failed to act on it and no doubt Israel expected that this Faith Journey would be easy a straight walk to the promised land after all look what he just done in Egypt he utterly destroyed Egypt and here they came with The God Who capped every one of the Egyptian gods had showed Egypt there is no God but me so they thought oh my this is going to be a cakewalk we're going to the promised land God gave us a prophet God gave us a message God has called us out of the bondage of Egypt we're going to the promised land but you see God never promised to move sailing he never promised that but the promise that he gave them was I've already given you the land but he never said how they was going to get there he never said that he just said I've only it's a good land I have already given you the land but he never said this is how you'll get there he just said you're going there amen will glory and every time they hit a bump in the road as we say they would become discouraged and they would murmur and they would complain against God and the life of the Israelites took a turn to the worst when the king of Edmund refused to let them travel through the Bible said was the King's Highway because his land was between them and the promised land and it would have been much easier to pass through this man's land to get to the promised land that God gave them so they approached this King and said look can we come through your land we won't go through your Vineyards we won't go through your fields we won't drink your water we just want to walk the King's Highway to the promised land and if by chance one of our cattle drinks or water or one of our people drinks your water we will gladly pay you for the water we drink we're not asking for a handout we're just simply asking let us pass through your land and the King the king refused to let them pass he said if you come to my land we will attack you stay away go some other way to get to where you're going you're not coming through here what discouraging words to hear when there's a pathway right through there and they said no can't go but but it's right nope how much go around enjoy the walk have a good trip and the Bible said when they turned it from now or by the way of the Red Sea to go around the land of Eden because they would not let him go through there The Souls of the people was much discouraged because of the way of their Journey oh my you see that was this pathway it was the Bible says it was the King's Highway not a footpath a highway and yet they couldn't walk on the King's Highway he refused to let them come so the Bible said they had to go around this way by the Red Sea to go around the land of Edmund and The Souls of the people was much discouraged because of the way and they were forced to travel into a Barren mountainous Rocky dry desert these were the chosen people of God he told Moses tell Pharaoh Israel is my son thus saith the Lord let my son go I have come to deliver I didn't come to steal his slaves I come to deliver my heritage this was God's chosen people led by a pillar of fire a cloud that day a pillar of Fire by night my God that's pretty good and God could have destroyed the king of Edmond just like he did the Egyptian Army is that not true if he could do it to Egypt could he not do it to Edom but God chose not to do it God allowed Eden to give Israel a hard time think about that for a minute God's chosen people led by a pillar of fire and yet he allowed this King to give his people a hard time he allowed him to give Israel a hard time see it was it was God it was God who led Israel around this Edomite Nation what was God doing he was leading his people to the Fulfillment of the promise you said brother why am I going through this why am I dealing with this it's God leading you to the Fulfillment of his promise I am the Lord thy God who either thee is he in controller is he not in control is he Our God or is he not our God it was God leading his people to the Fulfillment of the promise and discouragement came when God's directions did not meet their expectations oh you're quiet this morning but I guess you're listening foreign discouragement came when their expectations did not agree with God's directions well I thought certainly he would do this I guess he don't love me I guess he don't care I guess he don't care I'm going through this you're taking your opinion over his promise you're taking your feelings over his promise you're taking your emotions over his promise listen friends I don't care if every morning and many mornings I have to God knows it's the truth I can hardly get out of bed because of my back but I do not let that discourage me I still claim he is my healer that's got nothing to do with it I prayed over people with back trouble seeing God heal them instantly I've seen him shout the church down and I couldn't hardly get back to the hotel room I hurt so bad but it does not matter that's got nothing to do with it the path you take does not deter from the promise he made my God that ought to be on the T-shirt that produced discouragement and the discouragement discouragement has a poison discouragement has a poison the loss of confidence the loss of enthusiasm and disheartenment is the poisoned of discouragement and when these people were infected by this poison of discouragement the Bible said the people spake against God and against Moses his prophet and they said wherefore have you brought us out of Egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no bread and there isn't any water and our souls our souls are Loth of this light bread we can't stand another day of it Angel bread not rainbow bread from Rainbow Bakery but Angel bread from the Covenant God and they begin to complain against the very manna that God provided for them that manner was good enough to sustain them that manner was good enough to sustain him in the wilderness and I say to you this morning my brother my sister this manner that God has given us is good enough to sustain us through the layout of sea of wilderness man should I live thy bread alone but by every word that precedeth out of the mouth of God Souls spies this manner but you see there was an antidote to this poison of discouragement now an antidote by definition is a remedy or an agent used to neutralize or counteract the effects of poison so there was an antidote against this poison of discouragement and they must do one or two things they must either take the antidote or receive the poison the antidote against discouragement that was caused by the way the way the way to the promised land the discouragement that was caused by the way for the Promised Land like blackouts in it earthquakes and volcanoes famine in the land for the hearing of the word of God obstacles that's in the way of the promise of our journey to the rapture the antidote gets the discouragement that was caused by the way it was the promise oh my the antidote that neutralized the poison of discouragement was the promise that God gave them in Exodus 3 8 he said I am come down to deliver them out of the hands of the Egyptians and to bring them out of that land or to a good land and a large land unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto a place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the amorites and the presidents and the hibits and the jebusites another Behold The Cry or the children of Israel has come up unto me and also have seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians have oppressed them and I've come now therefore I will send you unto Pharaoh that thou may bring forth my people out of Israel out of Egypt and Moses said unto God who am I that I should go into Pharaoh that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt he said certainly I will be with thee and this shall be a token unto they not have sent thee when thou has brought forth the people out of Egypt ye shall ye shall you know like you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost ye shall serve God of bone this mountain not could be not hope so not maybe you're going to serve me right here this is the token I'm giving you a covenant oh God the antidote to the discouragement was to encourage themselves in the promise that God made them if they would have took the antidote they would have said it don't matter if we have to go around it or over it or under it or through it it don't matter we're still going but the discouragement is a poison because it causes you to doubt God you see discouragement causes you to doubt God that's the opposite of faith because Faith pleases God you see the prophet of God said it pleases God when you keep his word not doubt but belief it's the opposite of faith Faith pleases God in their time of testing in their time of testing the discouragement caused him to doubt God and because of the loss of confidence in The God Who made the promise it displeased God is that not true and the penalty of their discouragement the Bible said the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people much and the people of Israel died the Bible said with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness what brought the displeasure discouragement therefore the Bible says that the people came to Moses said we have sinned for we have spoke against the Lord and against thee pray unto the Lord that he take away the serpents from us were wrong we've sinned we've disbelieved God we've let our problems get bigger than our God we get the dirty get bigger than the land who is sinned against him pray to the Lord did he take away the serpents from us and Moses prayed for the people and the Lord said unto Moses make the afari serpent and set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten when he looks upon it he shall live the penalty of discouragement you see in First Corinthians 10 11 the Bible says this now all these things happen unto them for examples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come God allowed these things to be written about them to tell you don't you do what they did the people that comes upon the ends of the Earth listen for hits we're not in the first search age where in the last Church age we are in the seventh Church days and it is the seventh churches that takes the rapture Enoch was the Sabbath from Adam and Enoch did not see death and that he was translated that before his translation before his Rapture he had this testimony that he pleased God who was Enoch typing who was he not typing he was typing you you say well if I could be if I could be like Enoch Enoch said I'm so glad I'm tapping you so let's look for a few minutes who a few in their times of discouragement they took the antidote that was provided against the discouragement Peter was discouraged but he took the antidote the prophecy they were fishermen they knew the signs they made the living by fishing they were commercial fishermen that was their occupation they knew they were the bill dances of their day they knew all about the lake when the water was riding and that they'd stained all night long and they hadn't even taken one fish they had took nothing and they were washing their Nets and they were in discouragement the prophet said anytime a fisherman goes fishing they don't catch fish he is discouraged that right Brazil he is scurries anytime Tennessee don't win oh well for another day they hadn't took a fish they had signed all night long and had taken nothing the prophet said they were washing out their Nets and they were discouraged and the prophet said you people that lived close to this River fish all night and catch nothing it's discouraging but Jesus spoke to them you see in the prophet said it's in those times of discouragement that he comes to you but do not fail to me don't miss him when he comes don't be so discouraged that you miss him when he comes to you because it's in those times of discouragement that he comes and it was little this time in Peter's life that he came and Jesus said go out into the lake again go right out there where you was at and let down for a drought let down and take up a whole net full of fish now I've not seen you around here before Are you a are you another local fisherman have you maybe fished another place and you've you're telling me I'm a professional and you're telling me to go right out there where I was just at and throw a net that I throwed all night long it caught nothing I've had no sleep I've had nothing to eat I've not even had coffee and you're wanting me to go right out there and throw a net again Peter said Lord we've seen all night we have taken nothing but here's the antidote in his time of discouragement now he's got to do one or two things he's got to either keep the discouragement those I have called nothing are you listening to me are you called nothing you can either keep those words of discouragement or he can take the antidote we've spent all night we've seen all night we've taken nothing but nevertheless at your word at your word now that my emotion now that my feelings not at my knowledge not at my understanding but at Thy Word Hallelujah Hallelujah I'll let down the net God said so Hallelujah faith will put fish there if there isn't any fish there at Thy word believe God against all human ability or understanding or doctors reports or pet scans or CT scans or MRIS [Applause] I took the antidote and he went home his wife said did you catch anything look at the boat it's about that far on the water did we catch anything look at Lazarus Lazarus was dead his two sisters left alone in the world their parents were there there was no one there to look out for them no security no one to provide for them just two sisters in in sackcloth and Ashes weeping over the death of the brother and no doubt a lot of their weeping wasn't just for the loss of their brother but it was for the loss their own self-pity laughs hey we're all human huh who sat in our sackcloth and Ashes dressed in black weeping they sent for Jesus when Lazarus got sick they sent for Jesus and guess what he went the other way I'm talking about the Jesus that stayed in her home I'm talking about the Jesus that they cooked supper for I'm talking about the Jesus that they left the organization and they left their denominations to follow this man that they were saying on the internet he was the cult and a false prophet and a liar but they left everything to follow this man and when they needed him the most he went the other way times discouragement discouraging time hey Mary Martha didn't didn't you leave your church to follow that message cult that self-made Prophet where'd he go to school anyway and the Bible said that Mary sat still in the house and when she heard that Jesus has come she went out to meet him and she said through her tears Lord if you would have been here my brother would not have died the Bible said Jesus saw Mary weeping and he groaned in his spirit and he said to Mary where have you laid him it's fixing to get interested where have you laid here I said unto him Lord come and see and the Bible says the shortest verse in the Bible the Bible said that Jesus wept and they are another Jews they said behold look look how he loved this man he's standing there weeping but was he weeping because Lazarus was going or was he weeping because for their unbelief Jesus wept and some of them said oh how he must have loved him some of them said could not this man that opened the eyes of the blind could not have caused even this man that he shouldn't have died couldn't he even keep him from dying Jesus therefore groaned again in himself and he cometh to the Grave it was a cave and a stone was laid upon it and Jesus said in their time of discouragement in their time of weeping Jesus said take away the stone that's the antidote take away the stone and Martha in her discouragement even though she had done said yes Lord I know I know he'll rise again in the resurrection and Jesus said I have the resurrection even though he had said that Martha even in her discouragement she said Lord by this time he stinks his nose has done fell in he's been dead four days are you really sure you want us to take that stone away here's the antidote in the midst of all this discouragement here is the antidote Jesus said unto her said not I unto thee if thou wouldst believe thou should see the glory of God you want to see the glory of God don't doubt don't try to figure it out come on friends you don't have to pump it up work it up shout it up just believe him you want to see the glory of God just believe him looked off to the Sea the glory of God the antidote the antidote was if you would believe they're setting all around the discouragement and in tears now you're going to do one or two things either stay in your discouragement or roll away the stone what are you going to do this morning and that big rock that's in your life what are you gonna do about it he's going to set in your discouragement in your confusion in your nervousness or you can roll away the stone notice Jesus didn't say no Martha you're kind of small you know you're kind of a little feeble there if you'll step aside now I'll roll that stone away he never said that he never lifted a finger to move the stone he said you roll away the stone you know many times wait to see what the Lord will do maybe he's waiting to see what you'll do [Music] amen we serve a God who turned water into wine hey that's pretty good how many times does he have to do it before we believe it how many times does he have to heal cancer how many times oh my does he have to open blinded eyes how many times does he have to make the lane get up and walk before we'll finally believe him we could sit around discouraged we could sat around in our tears we can look at Fox News until we're all upset or we can roll away the stone and when they took the antidote and rode away a stone a man that had been dead four days came forth when Jesus said last night come forth and you know what the next thing he said Lucy and let him go David foreign David was a man after God's Own Heart so let's look and see how David dealt with discouragement and we can understand how to please God in our times of discouragement because David was a man after God's Own Heart and let me assure you today times of discouragement we'll come to all of us will there have you ever been discouraged oh wow sure I'll be honest many times have you many times when things didn't work out because you thought they should or it didn't happen when you thought it should happen When you pray for somebody and they walk away still dragging their foot it's discouraging sometimes when you believe with all your heart that God will do something for them and then the next year you see them they're walking normal because God done it for them yeah we all make those discouraging times friends but let's look and see how David dealt with this discouragement because it will come to all of us whether we're young or old now the Bible says in first Samuel chapter 30. that it came to pass there when David and his men were come to ziggling on the third day that the amalekites had invaded the South and ziglag and smitten ziglag and burned it with fire and had taken captive there at the end they took Cactus they slew not any neither great or snow but they carried them away they came in they burned they didn't kill anybody not one woman not one child they just come in and burnt the city and kidnapped the entire Village and took them with them and here come David and his men riding up to think like and I could just see them here they've been in a great battle these were rugged Warriors these were men who could take a sword and cut a man's head off with one swing here was men that fought so hard that they had to cleave the sword out of their hands I think one of them killed 300 at one time in a field rugged hardened soldiers not new recruits not new recruits that just had a uniform no these were battle scarred Warriors they had been in battle they knew what it was to see men cry on the battlefield for their mothers as they were trying to hold on to their guts because they'd been ripped out of them the cruelty the hardness of War you brothers that's been in combat I take my hat off to you things you had to endure the things you had to see young people want to do something you want to do something good for somebody go to the VA and shake a veteran's hand tell them thank you for your service to our country I said it's a shame that to give homosexuals a whole month and to give veterans one day it's a shame the hardened Warriors that came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captive they were coming back from the battle they were headed home they were happy as well I'll tell you one thing my wife makes the best apple pie I bet she's got one in the window an oval dog out there oh rufusion Old man he's going to wag his tail when he sees me and I can't wait to see little Johnny and I can't wait to see Sarah and give her a hug my little girl well they were so happy they were coming back from the battle following David their King their leader fighting for David away from their wives away from their children away from their families fighting for their King and when they came back to the city of Ziegler and no doubt they broke up over the hill and they was laughing and singing and having a great time and when they come up over the hill that was the city it was burnt there were no dogs wagging their tail no apple pie in the window no Johnny no Sarah no wife no welcome back kiss they were gone they were all gold the whole city her sons and their daughters and their wives were taken captive then David and the people with him lifted up their voices and wept until the Bible said there had no more power to weep these were battle-hardened soldiers who saw battle but yet this had brought such discouragement they were in tears they whelped till they had no more ability to weep and the Bible says that David was greatly distressed for the people spake of stone in him his own men who fought for him who believed that he would be the king he would reign as king and they were willing to die for David now these very men were so discouraged by what they saw in Ziegler that they picked up stones to kill David you know a stone is a confession and I wonder how many times in our times of discouragement we have picked up confessions against our Lord why am I going through this what have I done to deserve this yes they picked up Stones how many times have we made a confession I'll be honest I'm raising how many times have we made a confession I can't start Lord the Bible said David was greatly distressed time of great discouragement that his own men who just fought a battle with him now was turning against him it's your fault David you're trying to make a name for yourself if I'd have been out there fighting for you my wife would not be a took away from me it's your fault well said David was greatly distressed for the sake of owning him because the souls of all the people was grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters so here's the antidote in this time of discouragement the Bible says but David he didn't quit he didn't run and hide behind a rock but he looked to The Rock the Bible said that David encouraged himself in the Lord his God in the time of great distress he did not run he did not quit he did not give up he simply reminded himself of what God said about him God hallelujah God sent a prophet to tell him you will reign as king and how can I be stoned by my old men and reign as king so I will take God's word over the situation that I'm in and David encouraged himself and the Lord his God who made the promise to David armies will fail us Nations will fail us families will fail us but God our God will never fail us [Music] everything David said to abathar the priest amalek's son I pray thee bring me hither the ephod and he brought the IFA to David and David required of the Lord I said what shall I do Lord shall I pursue after this troop shall I overtake them what do you want me to do Lord I don't care how bad it looks I'm following your leadership I don't care how bad it looks I don't even care what I think about it Lord my thoughts don't even matter I have no opinion listen friends I'm not interested in your opinion you know why because I'm not even interested in my own opinion my opinion means nothing it's not what I think it's what God Said what do you want me to do Lord just tell me what you want me to do shall I pursue after this truth shall I overtake them and God answered David he said pursue pursue go after him David for Thou shalt truly overtake them and without fail you shall recover all even the apple pies you shall recover all so David gets up encouraged because the word of the Lord neutralized the poison of discouragement and David got up you know he liked to dance anyway he might have moonwalked a little bit I don't know but David got up he got us happy he got him smiling and just being [Music] oh my God David's lost his mind look at him he's dancing out there he's smiling he's laughing yes oh he lost his mind all right because he got the mind of God he had the mind of God and listened for his we're not we're not serving God under a closed book we're not serving God under a sealed book The Seals have been opened we know God hallelujah we know the mind of God concerning us we know who we are we know who God our God is we know what God requires of us we know where we came from we know our DNA we know our genetics we know where we're going the prophet said I went into the backside of God's mind Hallelujah he has revealed his mind to us concerning us David got up say listen boys I know you're hurting I know you're troubled I know you're crying I know you're discouraged I know you're thinking about killing me but here's what I want you to do I want you to dry your eyes sharpen your swords tighten up your saddles because we're going to ride who are we going David where we go we're going to get that apple pie and your wife who baked it and little Johnny hey little sir the Bible says in first Samuel 30 17 he smote them from the Twilight even into the evening of the next day oh I could see in the campus of the of the Malachi I could see him just rejoicing what day one thing we pulled one over on David he was out there fighting that little Skirmish while he was out there man we went in there and burned the city down we but we took his wives we took the boys we took everything and David's wife said you're going to be sorry you're going to be sorry David's coming he ain't gonna leave us down here like this he ain't gonna leave us down here in this Darkness lay Odyssey he ain't going to leave us down here in these Troublesome nuclear times he's not going to leave us in this time of plagues and famines and fires and volcanoes and earthquakes and flood come on somebody he ain't going to leave us here much longer [Applause] and David is coming for us our David is coming for us are you ready to go young people are you ready to go Mama are you ready to go amen quit looking at your discouragement quit looking at the discouraged times and let's get ready to go [Applause] hush up woman we're trying to Rejoice over this victory you ain't got no victory you ain't got nothing he's coming and there's out there hooting and hollering and all of a sudden not on the horizon they saw a dust cloud they said all you reckon that is she said that'd be David the Bible says that there was nothing lacking to them neither small nor great neither Sons nor daughters neither spoil nor anything that had been taken to them but David recovered oh because David took the antidote against discouragement so the question comes to my mind what are we going to do about our times of discouragement we sing two two tops one who took the discouragement and was punished one who took the antidote and saw great things so what are we going to do in our times of discouragement says I want to ask you a question what good does it do us to come to church and sit in a meeting and Ponder and maybe be discouraged because we didn't get a prayer court or maybe be discouraged because of some ill thing a neighbor did or discouraged about one little matter or the other that keeps Christ away from you when you're discouraged that keeps Christ away from you it's when you're thinking on him that he comes so in our times of discouragement when he comes what causes him to come is when we begin to think on him you see you may not be able to stop discouragement from coming but we can't keep it from staying so I say to you and I this morning let's take the antidote let's encourage ourselves in the Lord let's encourage ourselves in the promises he has made for us he said in Joshua 1 9 have not I commanded thee be strong be of good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed you know what that word dismayed means neither be thou discouraged for the Lord thy God is with thee the Lord thy God is with thee whether so ever thou goest in the good times in the bad times in the High Times in the low times in the valley on the mountain he is with us he promised in his word I will never leave thee nor will I forsake thee Deuteronomy 31 8 in the Lord he he is that goeth before thee he will be with thee he will not fail thee neither forsake thee fear not neither be discouraged Isaiah 41 10 fair thou not for I am with thee be not discouraged for I am thy God I will strengthen the yea I will help thee yay I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness no weapon formed against thee shall prosper I am the Lord thy God that healeth thee we can speak we can stay discouraged because we're sick or we can be encouraged because he's our healer encourage yourselves in the Lord don't be discouraged we're living in a terrible hour the prophet said a terrible hour for the unbeliever it is a terrible hour for the unbeliever but a wonderful hour a wonderful hour for the believer we are living in a terrible hour a terrible hour for the unbeliever but a wonderful hour for the believer for we're near the end time to which we're looking for the coming of the Blessed Lord that's why we're here Redeeming the time because we know we have not much time left we know it friends there is no Eighth Day messenger coming there is no Prophet rising up for the Gentiles there is none coming the only thing left for the church the only thing left for us is the coming of the Lord you see the prophet told the story just give me a few more minutes I'll close Prophet told a story about a boy riding a bicycle and they said if you could ride I think it was 50 yards across this plank or whatever it was if whoever can ride across it and not fall off we'll win this brand new bicycle every boy got on that plank I got on that bicycle wrote just a little bit fell off but this one little fella jumped on the bike and he rode it all the way to the end and he won the bicycle all the other boys fell off but this little fella he won the bike and they said how did you do it he said you guys were looking right here you were looking right down here and it made you nervous it cost you to doubt that you could do it and you wobbled and fell off how'd it look right here when I got on the bike I looked at the Finish Line I looked to the end if you're discouraged this morning look to the end look in the back of the book I don't care what battle you're in look to the back of the book we win we win [Applause] amen he didn't look at the present he said I looked at the Finish Line in the prophets and friends don't look at the things right here look at the end if I had to look at the things right here in front of me I'd be a discouraged person but I never look here I never look here I watch the end oh brother dial but you don't you don't know the battle I'm in don't look at the Battle look at the victory well how do you know I'll have a victory because he said so God creates win-win situations for his children Prophet said notice when you're discouraged that's when the devil can really pour it on you that's when he gets you if you come to church you say well I don't know I don't know whether I'll ever get any better or not I've been prayed for twice oh my you might as well go home that's all but when you can cast that aside God don't want you frowning I lost my place God don't want you frowning God wants you to be happy are you happy God wants you to be happy the human heart was made to be happy hang on to your false teeth worry will cause cancer some of you people want all these other processed foods because you're afraid you're going to get cancer and you worry yourself to death that you're going to get cancer come on it's true friends oh they won't touch them I ain't touching that right there California said that causes cancer you're going to believe California you can't get one thing at Lowe's but what says California says this causes cancer I'm thinking it's a screw Ed worry causes cancer temper oh my God temper will cause cancer don't never be upset oh God help us you might as well say it too God help us don't never be upset just walk in love amen knowing that you're walking in him and nothing can harm you there's nothing can harm you there's neither Powers things present things future there's nothing that can separate us from him we are in him and we never came in by our own will oh God he by choice elected us and brought us to him the Lord encourage you this morning I didn't even choose this do you know what I was going to be when I growed up I was going to be a soldier I joined the army to be a lifer as I call him 30 years in the military that was my objective preacher are you kidding it never entered my mind and I used to witness to people when I got saved and I went back to ETSU because I got saved on Christmas break and when I went back to school I started witnessing about the Lord and people said you're a preacher I said no I'm not I I just like to I just like to tell the people about what the Lord done for me and then he spoke to me one day I said go preach my word so I did we never chose this ourself you understand that this morning you're not even here by your own choice you're here by his choice he chose us in him then be friends if he chose us in him do you think for a moment he's going to lose us then we should be the happiest people on earth we don't serve him by Creed we don't serve him by a Dogma we serve him by revelation the prophet said we know I told you I'm close I'm close I heard the pastor say this morning that many are becoming discouraged what we need Brothers to take courage what we need is to be encouraged that's right trials may come where never was promised to be immune from them but he will give us Grace to go through them if the Mountain's too high to go over if it's too deep to go under if it's too wide to go around it he will give us Grace to go through it that's right just don't worry keep your eyes on Christ for he's the only one who can take us through God said in Jeremiah I'll give them a heart to know me that I am the Lord and they shall be my people and I will be their God for they shall return unto me with their whole heart my Tabernacle also shall be with them yea and I will be their God and they shall be my people Zechariah 8 I will bring them and they should dwell in the midst of Jerusalem and they shall be my people and I will be their God in truth and in righteousness Jeremiah says thus saith the Lord learn not the way of the Heathen be not discouraged by the signs of Heaven for the Heathen are discouraged by the sons the signs of the heavens discourage the unbeliever don't learn the ways because they're discouraged with the signs of Heaven that's exactly what the Bible says that's the last phrase of the Bible said they are discouraged they're dismayed they're discouraged with them see that just discourages them that's exactly right so they do the same thing and they do notice right below he said also that there will be fearful sights in the heavens signs in the heavens and in the earth is that right and what did Jeremiah say be not discouraged at the signs in the heaven you say sign in heaven why they wondered even Pentagon you see not long ago all this year Flying Saucer stuff they wonder what it's all about I just saw an article just the other day that that the Pentagon is investigating 150 confirmed unidentified sightings they wonder what it's all about they can't make it out it's an invisible force it almost comes down there and it's an intelligent and I'm not a flying saucer man and all this your nonsense that's been told about it that's nothing to that it is no fire and saucer it is no men from Mars it is not life on another planet somewhere that's investigating our life that's nonsense that's been told about death there's nothing to that don't you believe that don't you believe that they're UFOs but they're Sons and the sons discourage the unbeliever it's a very discouraging time for the unbeliever but a very happy time for the believer for we believe that the time of our Redemption is drawing High but you lord said it would be this way and you've made it known to us you have made it known to us so we would not be discouraged be not discouraged for the Lord thy God is with thee he will keep thee he will sustain thee he will take us home with him one day when discouraging times come friends and they will come we have an antidote remember what he said in his word about us in God's mind we've all ready made it they led us this morning encourage ourselves in the promises concerning ourselves he says our children are our own Heritage do not be discouraged by the rebellious ways you just keep reeling them in just keep reeling on me keep reeling with me do you love him this morning why would I worry when Giants come calling my name my God it's so much bigger than troubles I face why would I hunger for power or riches or fame because my God is so much better than all of these things so I won't be shaken I won't be moved for my God is faithful his promise is true so I speak to the mountains and say it's time to move because my God is bigger better stronger and greater than you love you as Belarus [Applause] Hallelujah thank you thank you Lord for your word thank you for the antidote Lord that neutralizes the poison of discouragement and Lord you allow these things to come into our life just to see where we take the antidote when we take the promise where we let our problems when we let the journey or we will let the battle get bigger than you but I say to this mountain this morning you're going to have to move because my God is bigger better stronger and greater than you that's the kind of God you are Lord it's the god of God you are when I was young called my name I tried to run but still you came because that's the kind of God that you are Lord may your people take courage today Father Lord I know there's many tries in the father have not be little under problems Lord God I know there's there's sick children today the parents is worried Lord those two little girls that was in the accident God oh Lord when I saw him there everybody be obsessed my heart just went out to him Lord God I know how that is to the hospital to see your baby in that condition but Lord I pray may your spirit go to the family Lord may they not look at the bruises the neck braces and all the IVs may they look to you the Healer and the deliverer Lord God if there's some here this morning of all they're just battling different tissues some battling cancer Lord we know others just battling maybe menopause Lord at times of nervousness father maybe some just discouraged with the news and the things that's happening but oh God may we take the antidote today Lord may we believe your report may we believe your word today Lord we pray and may we cast us out everything that's contrary to your word and may we do like David in the time of his great distress he never gave up he never quit he never ran but he encouraged himself and the Lord and oh God in this great battle maybe some here is in a tremendous battle today maybe nobody in this building even knows but them but God in this time of great battle may they encourage their self in you Lord for you are our God the keeper of our Flame you will be with us he will not forsake us but you will take us Lord to your table until that Time Lord may we be faithful I pray if you're here this morning baby this message has spoke to you I don't know just all week uh sitting in the stand I was thinking on these things but maybe this message that's the kind of God we serve this morning that he would put this on my heart to speak to a room full of people for one person that's going through a time of discouragement if you're that person this morning this word is for you now what are you going to do you're going to keep that discouragement are you going to cast it aside and take the antidote I will rejoice I will rejoice in the Lord God of my salvation I will rejoice in the god of my Deliverance I will rejoice in the God my healer have a rejoice in my God for there is no God like my God if you're here this morning I know there's not room here for for an altar you don't have to come to an altar friend we it's in your heart we know that but if you're here this morning and this word is spoke to you I wonder if you just slip up your hand and say Lord I received that today foreign [Music] listen I was thinking the other day president talked about that box of rattlesnakes and here not long ago a package came to my door and the man rang the doorbell and I went to the door he said you need to sign for this it was my package had my name over it came to my house but he wouldn't give it to me till I signed for it but once I signed for that package he handed it to me and said have a good day and brother Branham talked about how Satan will come to our door with a box of rattlesnakes and if we sign for them they're ours but if you don't sign for them he can't give them to you he has to take them back and I was thinking about that if that's true for rattlesnakes there would not that be true when healing comes to our door when the Lord comes to our door with healing if you'll receive that it's yours it's got your name on it all you've got to do is receive it if the devil can give you a box of rattlesnakes because you received it cannot God give you healing Deliverance joy peace if you'll just receive it this morning if you'll just sign your name to it that promise belongs to me that promise belongs to me God spoke that in his word to me I believe the report of the Lord if you'll sign for that this morning for your healing would you just raise your hand for your deliverance if you'll just raise your hand for your encouragement for whatever you have need of if you just say Lord I receive it today in the name of Jesus Christ oh Father God the whole room Lord my hands is up too hey God I believe the promises of your word to be true the Lord knows this morning they're streaming that would maybe want to be in service and decaying because of health reasons Lord may you touch him right there where they're at in their living room Lord sitting there looking at their computer may you touch them Lord good father you see every hand that's raised today we take the antidote against discouragement Against The Scourge in times that we're in Lord when the world is falling apart all around us every day there's more killings and robberies and this and that and oh it's getting to be such an unfit place for us to live but father that's not discouraging to us even though it's a discouraging time to them because that's all they've got but Lord to us father to us it's just another sign of our soon coming they're soon coming to take us Lord because we know you'll not leave us here much longer in the world in this condition so I will not be shaken I will not be moved but I believe in you father for your promises are true father you see the hands today by the same anointing that raised my Lord from the grave but that same minority they gave my daughter back to me but then already move about every heart this morning Lord upon every life I will never struggle upon every middle issue every spiritual issue but you move upon each one today God and we cast down reason and we cast down fear and we cast down doubt and we received Thy Word for we've encouraged ourselves in the Lord granted today Lord in Jesus name we pray amen and amen do you love him today Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah amen thank God good what a loving father that we have to
