[28:27] Souls
[28:31] [Music]
[28:42] thank you Lord
[28:55] we're so grateful for that today
[29:01] God bless you let's just see each one of
[29:03] you today
[29:05] the presence of the Lord
[29:09] let's turn to the Book of Joshua if you
[29:10] would
[29:14] Joshua chapter 5.
[29:18] I must forgot to pay that electric bill
[29:20] again didn't they
[29:26] Joshua chapter 5 verse 13.
[29:30] be having the youth youth service
[29:33] tomorrow night
[29:35] what we've been having it there
[29:37] question answers Rob said 6 30 I think
[29:40] so
[29:41] that would be the desire to come for
[29:43] that service
[29:46] Joshua chapter 5 verse 13.
[29:52] and it came to pass when Joshua
[29:55] thank you
[29:57] it was by Jericho
[30:00] that he lifted up his eyes and looked
[30:05] and behold
[30:07] there stood
[30:09] a man
[30:11] behold there stood
[30:14] a man
[30:15] over against him
[30:17] with his sword drawn in his hand
[30:21] and Joshua went unto him and said unto
[30:23] him
[30:24] art thou for us
[30:26] or for our adversaries
[30:30] and he said nay
[30:32] but as the captain
[30:35] of the host of the Lord
[30:38] am I now come
[30:41] Joshua fell on his face to the Earth
[30:45] and did worship
[30:49] and said unto him
[30:51] what saith my Lord
[30:55] unto his servant
[30:57] and the captain of the Lord's host said
[31:00] unto Joshua loose thy shoe
[31:04] from off thy foot
[31:07] for the place whereon thou standest
[31:10] is Holy
[31:12] and Joshua
[31:14] did so
[31:16] so I wonder what made that place holy
[31:19] it was the presence of this being
[31:23] whoever it was
[31:25] that had made it holy
[31:29] then when this being left
[31:33] the place wasn't whole anymore
[31:37] what Sanctified that place it was his
[31:40] presence
[31:42] you know what makes this these rooms in
[31:44] here
[31:45] sanctified
[31:48] a couple times a week Holiday Inn
[31:51] is Holy
[31:55] rest the time I'm not so sure about
[32:00] but this same man right here
[32:03] is what makes it holy
[32:05] and when that man appears and his people
[32:08] come together their presence consecrates
[32:13] wherever they are
[32:15] amen and makes it holy then when he goes
[32:18] back up
[32:19] his people disperse
[32:21] it goes right back to being whatever it
[32:23] was before
[32:25] we're truly blessed
[32:28] so then I ask you what if this man right
[32:31] here this verse I'm one
[32:33] was to come down and get in our souls
[32:37] and live in US 24 7.
[32:42] wouldn't we be a walking Temple
[32:45] of God
[32:48] well there you go
[32:50] service dismissed
[32:52] if you can grasp that it's been a great
[32:55] day
[32:57] I may like to be remembered as we pray
[32:59] today this is power hits together if you
[33:01] would
[33:04] Jesus we thank you so much
[33:07] and we can be together again Lord
[33:10] how we love church
[33:13] we already knew it but I think it's
[33:15] becoming more real to us that church is
[33:18] not necessarily the building where we
[33:21] are
[33:22] but it's where us and you are gathered
[33:26] together
[33:27] your angels your presence
[33:30] for that purpose we've come again today
[33:32] Lord
[33:34] we're asking you that you would speak to
[33:36] us
[33:37] help us
[33:38] if we can recognize your presence
[33:42] in our midst
[33:44] all of our troubles
[33:46] all the difficulties that we're going
[33:48] through they may not be totally
[33:50] dissipated away from us
[33:53] but we will realize they will never
[33:56] conquer us
[33:57] because your presence is here
[34:01] help us now fathers we look into your
[34:03] word in the name of the Lord Jesus we
[34:05] ask it
[34:06] and the Saints said amen God bless you
[34:10] you may be seated
[34:16] how many notes who this man was
[34:19] Christ
[34:22] and a theophonic appearance
[34:25] you know I like the way that Joshua went
[34:28] about this
[34:29] the first step toward victory
[34:33] is to acknowledge
[34:35] that we are second in command
[34:39] it took him a few minutes
[34:41] but it didn't take all day thankfully
[34:45] but he wasn't sure exactly
[34:47] who this person was
[34:50] who the being was that as the writer of
[34:53] the Book of Joshua said a man appeared
[34:57] before him most of us looking at a man
[35:01] it would be hard to know was it an
[35:04] angelic appearance was it a supernatural
[35:07] one was it just a human element
[35:10] but we find by what happened here that
[35:14] it was definitely more than a man I love
[35:18] the appearances of the Lord on the Earth
[35:22] I love the way that he custom fits those
[35:27] appearances according to the particular
[35:30] needs of his people
[35:33] Joshua was facing a great battle
[35:37] Jericho is the foremost City in the
[35:41] southern part of where they're going
[35:43] into
[35:44] and Joshua cannot go around it and say
[35:49] well we'll go north we'll go east we'll
[35:52] go west and then we'll come back and
[35:55] take this
[35:56] but Joshua knew it was necessary to take
[36:01] this first then God would give them the
[36:04] rest of the land
[36:06] but it was a city that was a great
[36:09] Conquest
[36:11] these people had thought some but they
[36:14] were mainly Masons they were
[36:17] householders they were slaves they were
[36:21] people that were not many of them
[36:24] professional Soldiers by any means and
[36:28] yet he's looking at a city that as far
[36:32] as we know historically had not yet been
[36:35] conquered
[36:36] so how do you take a city whose walls
[36:41] wind up being 20 feet thick
[36:45] how do you take a city that's so far
[36:49] historically no armies had yet been able
[36:53] to conquer no doubt different people had
[36:57] different ideas some would have said
[36:59] well I have read that what you do in a
[37:04] situation like this is you build a
[37:07] rampart and you go to climbing up with
[37:11] mounds of dirt and then you take Timbers
[37:14] and you make big wheels and you start
[37:17] rolling up that ramp until you're able
[37:20] to put your men over the top of the wall
[37:24] no doubt someone else would have said
[37:27] that's too much labor why don't we just
[37:30] camp out around this city and we'll
[37:34] starve them out because the Bible tells
[37:37] us that the city will shut up and I love
[37:41] the way brother Branham said it when he
[37:42] read that scripture in Joshua 6 1 when
[37:46] he read that the Bible said the city of
[37:49] Jericho was shut up brother Branham said
[37:51] it like this it was like a turtle in a
[37:55] shell
[37:57] so all you got to know is how to hunt
[37:59] and cook turtle
[38:02] so it depends on how you look at your
[38:06] circumstances
[38:08] now Joshua we have no record that Joshua
[38:12] asks for any input but this appearance
[38:16] was so custom fit for their situation
[38:20] I don't want to find amazing is we have
[38:23] no more spiritual occurrences that
[38:27] Christ himself ever appeared just like
[38:31] this again you know I think that where
[38:35] we are today and our time frame that the
[38:39] Lord Jesus knows exactly how to appear
[38:42] to us too
[38:44] there may be a time that he will appear
[38:46] in a bush or in a cloud or in a pillar
[38:50] of fire but he knows exactly what each
[38:54] of us need what do you need today you
[38:58] know I found so many times myself I
[39:01] don't even know how I need him I might
[39:04] pray Lord would you do this Lord would
[39:08] you do that father I need you to come
[39:10] this way or that way and yet he would
[39:14] show up in a way that was so different
[39:17] than the way I prayed and so different
[39:21] than the way of my anticipation that I
[39:25] was completely overwhelmed and yet it
[39:29] was the right way
[39:31] now we know that God had already
[39:34] appeared in different theophonic
[39:37] appearances prior to this in the Book of
[39:40] Genesis in the book of Exodus turn with
[39:43] me if you would you'd like to read with
[39:44] me in Genesis chapter 18 verse 1 and the
[39:49] Lord appeared to him this is Abram and
[39:52] the plains of mamory
[39:55] and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat
[39:59] of the day and he lift up his eyes and
[40:02] looked and lo three men stood by him and
[40:08] when he saw them he ran to meet them
[40:10] from the tent door and bowed himself
[40:14] toward the ground now the Bible does not
[40:18] declare to us that he appeared to Abram
[40:21] as the commander of the host of the Lord
[40:26] the Bible does not declare to us that he
[40:29] appeared to him as a pillar of fire but
[40:32] he appeared to him as a man now what's
[40:35] amazing was there were three men now you
[40:39] know I find it I find it overwhelming
[40:41] because the trinitarian theologians who
[40:45] try to look in the Bible to prove that
[40:48] there's three Gods this is one of the
[40:50] places that they go to so they try to
[40:53] make Father Son and Holy Ghost but of
[40:57] course we know there is no such a thing
[41:00] as three Gods there's only one
[41:03] but by a prophetic understanding we know
[41:07] that this was Jehovah and two of his
[41:12] mighty angels just down the road a great
[41:16] Supernatural saying had happened the
[41:19] prophet tells us is there anything too
[41:21] hard for the Lord in Tulsa in 1960 he
[41:25] said let's just imagine that it had been
[41:28] a pretty bad day so Sarah was in a very
[41:32] bad mood and the title were running
[41:35] short of food and they were running
[41:37] short of water and Sarah had told
[41:40] Abraham that Miss lot she had heard from
[41:44] her and she had moved down to the land
[41:47] of Sodom and she'd got all the latest
[41:50] fashions and everything was going so
[41:54] good seemingly for lot and his family
[41:57] since they had left the message
[42:02] that's always the way the devil will do
[42:04] you once he pulls you away from the word
[42:07] he'll convince you that you're so much
[42:10] better off until he gets you moved into
[42:13] Sodom and then when he get once he gets
[42:16] you moved into Sodom you're pretty much
[42:18] a goner so everything wasn't going real
[42:22] good lot had more grass lot had more
[42:25] water lot had more convenience and now a
[42:29] lot was a city man and he was also the
[42:32] judge or the mayor of the city so it
[42:35] seemed like since he left the message
[42:37] everything was going so good but I want
[42:41] you to notice one thing when the Lord
[42:44] God come down to make a special visit on
[42:47] the earth he never visited lot he
[42:50] visited Abraham
[42:52] so for me and my house I'll stay under
[42:55] the Oak in memory I may not have the
[42:59] water I may not have the popularity I
[43:02] may not have this and that and the other
[43:03] but I'd rather stay right here under the
[43:06] oak on half of the occasional visit from
[43:09] almighty God than to wind up being
[43:11] burned up by the sodomites
[43:14] amen
[43:19] but God did not appear to Abram in the
[43:24] same Supernatural way that he appeared
[43:27] to Joshua but yet this was exactly what
[43:31] Abraham needed you know God has has the
[43:35] ability to appear and manifest himself
[43:38] in so many ways I believe he's going to
[43:40] do it right here for us today
[43:42] notice here in verse 33 of the 18th
[43:45] chapter and the Lord went his way now we
[43:49] know that prior to this and the verses
[43:52] prior to this that to the of the two
[43:55] angels they went on toward the land of
[43:58] Sodom and God never went to the cities
[44:00] of Sodom and gomara but the Lord stayed
[44:05] with Abraham and Abraham as a mediator
[44:09] had intervened for lot's sake the only
[44:12] reason that lot was even spared was not
[44:17] because he was a good man not because he
[44:20] was a righteous man but because the man
[44:23] with the Covenant intervened and asked
[44:26] God for Mercy don't give up on your
[44:30] children don't give up on your lost
[44:33] loved ones that's exactly right God may
[44:36] hear your prayer and Spares them not
[44:39] because they're worthy not because they
[44:42] are deserved living but because God was
[44:45] merciful to you
[44:47] but when the Lord had heard Abram's
[44:50] prayer notice in verse 33 and the Lord
[44:52] went his way and as soon as it left
[44:55] communing with Abraham and Abraham
[44:58] returned unto his place but Abraham did
[45:02] not need a strategist to be able to lay
[45:05] out the battles of War because Abraham
[45:09] was not in that type of a battle but
[45:11] what Abraham did need was God that would
[45:15] appear in the form of a man and be able
[45:18] to have communion with Abraham that's
[45:20] what Abraham needed that's what Abraham
[45:23] got notice if you look with me also in
[45:27] Genesis 32 24 that the same Christ now
[45:31] appears to another man by the name of
[45:34] Jacob and Jacob was left alone and the
[45:38] Wrestled a man with him until the
[45:41] breaking of the day notice he is not a
[45:44] commander he is not a pillar of Fire he
[45:48] has not allowed a light rather or a
[45:50] cloud but he is a man and he looks so
[45:54] human and he could wrestle he could feel
[45:57] strain on his muscles and no doubt Jacob
[46:01] grabbed a hold of him and he might have
[46:02] put a little bit of herd on him who
[46:04] knows he must have really put up a fight
[46:07] and this time he appears in a weaker
[46:11] similarly seem like form so it was not
[46:15] great light of rays of life is emanating
[46:18] from his body it was not great Shekinah
[46:21] Glory but it looked like an ordinary man
[46:24] and it might have seemed as if though
[46:26] that Jacob was really doing a good job
[46:29] then he kept holding on and holding on
[46:32] and holding on to me what I'll see is
[46:35] the great hand of God in the display of
[46:38] condescension you understand that God
[46:41] would allow himself in this human
[46:44] looking form to seemingly he almost be
[46:48] overcome by a mortal notice in verse 29
[46:52] and Jacob asked him and said tell me I
[46:55] praise thee thy name and he said
[46:58] wherefore is it that thou just ask after
[47:00] my name and he blessed him there and
[47:03] Jacob called the name of the place to
[47:06] deal for I have seen God face to face my
[47:12] life is preserved so the angel of
[47:15] Jehovah is not a created angel it is not
[47:20] a created being separate from the deity
[47:24] of God but it is actually Jehovah
[47:27] himself in the form of
[47:31] self-manifestation the invisible becomes
[47:34] visible and he reveals himself now there
[47:37] can be no doubt I don't think any Bible
[47:39] reader to know that the angel of the
[47:41] Lord is the Lord himself Exodus 3 7 and
[47:45] the Lord said I have surely seemed the
[47:47] Affliction of my people which are in
[47:50] Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason
[47:53] of their taskmasters God's speaking to
[47:56] Moses for I know their sorrows and I am
[48:01] come down
[48:03] now you know God has appeared in so many
[48:07] different ways and dispensations but
[48:10] it's on the rare occasion that God
[48:13] actually uses these words and said that
[48:15] I have come down now what God had done
[48:18] he had come down and he was going to
[48:21] send Moses so I count Our Generation a
[48:25] very blessed bunch of people since the
[48:28] Lord has come down again
[48:30] now it's not in every generation that
[48:33] God comes down but it is a special time
[48:36] a special significance and remember the
[48:39] last time we spoke on this it was during
[48:41] the time of the Harlot Rahab which was a
[48:45] gentile that the commander of the Lord's
[48:48] host came down it is during the time of
[48:52] the bride's Omega Revival that the Lord
[48:56] himself appears again in the last days I
[49:00] am come down to deliver them out of the
[49:02] hand of the Egyptians and to bring them
[49:05] up out of that land unto a good land and
[49:08] a large until a land flowing with milk
[49:11] and honey unto the plant place of the
[49:14] Canaanites the Hittites the amorites the
[49:17] parasites the highlights and the
[49:19] jebusites notice in chapter 23 verse 20
[49:23] behold I send an angel before thee now
[49:28] God again speaking to Moses but now this
[49:31] time it's going to be a different
[49:33] manifestation of the same Christ watch
[49:37] this you know the Bible tells us that
[49:39] Moses chose to Bear the reproach of
[49:42] Christ rather than enjoy the pleasures
[49:44] than the treasures that was down in
[49:47] Egypt but the Bible doesn't say that
[49:49] Moses chose to Bear the reproach of
[49:52] Jesus because Jesus was the human body
[49:56] that Christ the amorphe of God lived in
[50:00] but Christ pre-existed Jesus the human
[50:03] part you understand just like you as an
[50:07] attribute of God pre-existed before your
[50:10] natural birth not as a mortal noun not
[50:12] as a soul we don't believe in
[50:13] pre-existence of souls or transmigration
[50:16] of souls but we existed in the mind of
[50:19] God as a thought then from there we come
[50:22] to become tangible on the earth so God
[50:25] came down but now notice what he tells
[50:28] Moses in this verse behold I send an
[50:31] angel before thee to keep thee in the
[50:34] way and to bring thee into the place
[50:37] which I have prepared beware of him and
[50:41] obey his voice provoke him not for he
[50:44] will not pardon your transgressions for
[50:48] my name is in him
[50:52] now notice God telling Moses I have come
[50:56] down to see you I have come into special
[50:59] manifestation to reveal myself to you
[51:02] but I will send my angel my personal
[51:06] Angel what is God's angel a physical
[51:10] manifestation of the invisible God and
[51:13] he calls it mine Angel and he says my
[51:17] name is in him but if Thou shalt indeed
[51:21] obey his voice and do all that I speak
[51:24] and I will be an enemy unto thine
[51:27] enemies and an adversary unto thine
[51:29] adversaries brother sister you can ask
[51:31] for nothing no better than that notice
[51:34] in verse 23 for mine angel now this is
[51:38] going to be the angel of God do you know
[51:41] every elect person on the earth has an
[51:46] angel
[51:47] Jesus says do not harm these little ones
[51:50] for their Angels always behold the face
[51:54] of my father so you have an angel it
[51:59] hung around your mother before you were
[52:01] ever born amen some of y'all looking at
[52:04] me funny now notice he says mine Angels
[52:08] shall go before thee and bring thee and
[52:10] then he repeats again of course all the
[52:13] tribes that he's going to run out before
[52:14] them so this is Jehovah himself and a
[52:19] temporary descent to visibility for a
[52:23] special purpose so we know that the
[52:26] Bible says that God is invisible and we
[52:30] know that the Bible goes on to tell us
[52:31] that Moses saw him who was invisible
[52:34] well that's totally impossible unless
[52:36] God would take on a visible form so we
[52:40] know then that God has done this in
[52:43] previous times notice again in Exodus
[52:45] chapter 3 verse 2. and the angel of the
[52:48] Lord appeared unto him in a flame of
[52:51] fire out of the midst of the Bush and he
[52:55] looked and behold the bush burned with
[52:56] fire but the Bush was not consumed same
[53:00] God different manifestation you know the
[53:03] great thing about it is the elect of God
[53:06] no matter what form God chooses to
[53:08] reveal himself you cannot hide God from
[53:12] the elect
[53:13] but you sure can't hide him from the
[53:15] foolish virgin because they'll look out
[53:18] at him and call him three every time
[53:19] they'll look right at him and not know
[53:22] who he is if you know who he is today
[53:24] you're a very blessed person now even
[53:26] though he will appear in one form and
[53:28] then change his mask and go into another
[53:30] and change his mask and go into another
[53:33] the elect of God have always recognized
[53:36] him so we don't want to put God in a
[53:39] mold and say well last Sunday the
[53:41] service went this way and that way and
[53:43] now we're looking for it to go the same
[53:45] way today nope today we have different
[53:47] needs we're fighting different battles
[53:49] is that right so what do we want today
[53:51] exactly what we need for today
[53:55] and then Wednesday night we want what we
[53:57] need for Wednesday night is that right
[53:59] now what you notice is I found the
[54:01] scripture the other day was down in
[54:02] South Carolina taking some days off
[54:04] resting with our family and I found the
[54:06] scripture I thought it's so beautiful
[54:08] Isaiah 63 8 and he said surely they are
[54:11] my people children that will not lie so
[54:15] he was their savior in all their
[54:18] Affliction he was afflicted and the
[54:22] angel of his presence saved them now
[54:26] notice again this is Christ and it'll
[54:29] see often in appearance and he calls him
[54:32] the angel of his presence in his love
[54:35] and in his pity he redeemed them and
[54:39] bears them and carried them all the days
[54:41] of old so now I went through all that to
[54:44] come back to the time in the
[54:46] dispensation of Joshua so here Joshua is
[54:49] now facing Jericho and he doesn't know
[54:52] which way to go he doesn't know what to
[54:54] do and no Daddy has as an opinion Joshua
[54:56] was a great General as a matter of fact
[54:58] the prophet tells us he was the greatest
[55:00] General that ever lived so he was a
[55:02] great great gender you understand the
[55:04] Napoleon studied part of Joshua's
[55:06] strategy you understand that part of the
[55:08] English Generals in World War one and
[55:10] also World War II that they also studied
[55:13] part of the strategy of Joshua and it
[55:16] was a great great thing but now this
[55:18] would not be a strategy that would
[55:20] really make any human sense because
[55:22] you've got this gigantic City and you've
[55:24] got walls that has an outer wall and an
[55:27] inner wall put both of them together
[55:28] they're 20 feet thick you've got houses
[55:31] that are spreaded across the top of the
[55:34] walls you've got them built out of great
[55:36] gigantic tremendous Stones which they've
[55:38] actually excavated excavated and found
[55:41] some of the stones still there laying in
[55:43] the dirt they've also found ancient
[55:45] Timbers to where that they fell down in
[55:47] the ground so looking at it was just a
[55:50] mind a carnal mind you say how in the
[55:52] world are we ever going to get in this
[55:53] place how are they going to to take this
[55:56] but this commanding officer by whom
[55:59] Joshua was submitted himself to worship
[56:01] now notice it tells you who this was
[56:03] this was not just an angel remember when
[56:07] John had this angel that appeared to him
[56:10] and made known to him the entire Book of
[56:12] Revelation and John fell down to worship
[56:15] the angel and he said see thou do it not
[56:18] I am one of thy fellow servants the
[56:20] prophets remember so had this been just
[56:24] a created angel that created angel would
[56:27] have stopped Joshua from worshiping him
[56:30] but whoever this was allowed Joshua to
[56:33] worship him and not only that he
[56:36] encouraged it
[56:37] so he tells him take your shoes off let
[56:40] me tell you something friend there will
[56:42] be no public victory until there is
[56:45] private worship I don't know about you I
[56:49] don't just worship God publicly before
[56:51] everybody else I don't want to just be a
[56:53] worshiper where I come to the house of
[56:56] God and I worship him I worship him
[56:58] every day of my life every day of my
[57:02] life I worship my king I give him praise
[57:05] for the air I breathe I give him praise
[57:07] for the water that I drank for the food
[57:09] that I have to eat I give him praise for
[57:12] you I give him praise from my friends I
[57:15] even give him praise for the trials
[57:16] today I go through because I know that
[57:19] he's doing it for my good you're saying
[57:21] God must to praise him for you need to
[57:23] open your eyes and look around you have
[57:26] got so much to praise him for
[57:30] oh Hallelujah
[57:35] you see reflecting in the behavior of
[57:38] what Joshua is now fixing to do the
[57:41] commanding officer let him know that I
[57:45] have given Jericho and the king and all
[57:48] of its Mighty soldiers I have already
[57:50] given it to you but now Joshua needs the
[57:54] strategy so what do I do you know all of
[57:57] us is the people of God when we Face
[57:59] different things of life we know that
[58:01] one strategy that maybe worked in this
[58:03] trial doesn't work in that trial I find
[58:06] it amazing looking at the life of the
[58:08] Lord Jesus among the scribes and the
[58:09] Pharisees would come out of time and
[58:11] whenever before the end of his ministry
[58:14] come he would rebuke them I mean he
[58:16] humiliated them he would call them all
[58:19] kinds of sarcastic names that would seem
[58:21] and rebuke them before the people but
[58:24] yet when it come to the time of the
[58:26] crucifixion the Bible says he held his
[58:29] peace and open not his mouth why you
[58:32] know that's really hard for some of us
[58:34] sometimes isn't it because sometimes the
[58:36] Lord will commission us to rebuke the
[58:38] devil and scream at him and holler at
[58:40] him and everything else and then there's
[58:42] other times to where you just hold your
[58:44] peace what is that it's a change of
[58:47] strategy but the thing of it is I'm
[58:49] afraid sometimes that we become so
[58:52] confident in the way we won the last
[58:54] battle or the last war that we signed
[58:57] well I'll just do this and this and this
[58:59] it works lifetime instead of us saying
[59:02] Lord how should I face this one I really
[59:04] don't know I've never been this way
[59:06] before father I don't know what to do
[59:08] should I scream should I holler said I
[59:11] shout or should I hold my peace this
[59:13] round
[59:14] well praise the Lord anybody know what
[59:16] I'm talking about but you see he's
[59:19] showing him the significance of God
[59:22] being able to be in control no matter
[59:25] what the battle is now he says back to
[59:28] Joshua 5 14 as captain of the host of
[59:31] the Lord I am now Khan and Joshua fell
[59:33] on his face to the Earth and in worship
[59:36] and said unto him what saith my Lord to
[59:40] his servant oh my so Israel's host is
[59:44] now accepting the real leader now Joshua
[59:47] of course is the natural Captain but
[59:50] he's putting himself in the perspective
[59:53] of where God wants him to be and Joshua
[59:56] recognizes he's second in command
[1:00:00] I wonder how many of us have done the
[1:00:02] same thing
[1:00:03] or do we still feel like we're number
[1:00:06] one command we're number one in the
[1:00:08] battles we're number one in the
[1:00:09] victories and we're number one in all of
[1:00:12] that nope the sooner we get to where we
[1:00:14] realize I can't even walk without you
[1:00:17] holding my hand that's the better part
[1:00:19] of the victory now the real character of
[1:00:23] the person that we're looking at is
[1:00:25] displayed about receiving and
[1:00:28] encouraging worship from Joshua so this
[1:00:30] gives Joshua that consolation to know
[1:00:33] who he's talking to because if this
[1:00:36] battle goes wrong then Joshua is going
[1:00:39] to be a complete failure so he's never
[1:00:42] seen this being before he's never heard
[1:00:44] this voice before there's no record that
[1:00:47] anyone ever appeared to Moses like this
[1:00:49] we have no record back to the Old
[1:00:52] Testament that anyone appeared to
[1:00:54] Abraham like this or Jacob or Isaac so
[1:00:58] this is the first appearance that God
[1:01:01] chose to come in this way how is he
[1:01:03] going to to know that it's God and not a
[1:01:06] demon
[1:01:07] oh my how is it going to know that it's
[1:01:11] the spirit of God and it's not the wrong
[1:01:14] thing we got a question on that from the
[1:01:16] use of maybe I'll get to tomorrow night
[1:01:17] well one thing that we can always know
[1:01:20] the spirit of God will never lead any of
[1:01:23] us contrary to his word when people say
[1:01:27] I feel led to do this and I feel led to
[1:01:30] do that I don't know who gets blamed the
[1:01:32] most for a lot of things that folks do
[1:01:34] God or the devil
[1:01:36] of course if people say well God led me
[1:01:38] to do it then if it's wrong of course it
[1:01:40] ain't your fault it's God's fault are
[1:01:42] you crazy God don't never make no
[1:01:44] mistakes and if they say well the devil
[1:01:46] made me a deal why don't you just go and
[1:01:48] accept the fact that you've done it
[1:01:49] yourself
[1:01:51] well praise the Lord now Joshua he's
[1:01:54] convinced that this voice this being the
[1:01:59] representation of what he sees and the
[1:02:02] voice that's coming from this being
[1:02:04] harmonizes was what Moses has already
[1:02:07] said so he feels like I have no choice
[1:02:10] but to follow this is him this is the
[1:02:13] commander this is him I will fall and I
[1:02:16] notice Joshua 6 1 and now Jericho will
[1:02:19] straightly shut up because of the
[1:02:22] children of Israel now they ain't even
[1:02:24] done anything yet and yet the city is
[1:02:27] all locked down all my other occult here
[1:02:29] they come and they're coming into our
[1:02:31] city oh my goodness what in the world is
[1:02:34] going to do so they figure the best
[1:02:35] thing to do is just shut her down I've
[1:02:37] been there before have you all ever been
[1:02:39] there where they shut you down and the
[1:02:42] Lord said unto Joshua see I have given
[1:02:45] into thine hand Jericho and the King
[1:02:48] thereof and the Mighty Men of Valor and
[1:02:52] you shall come past the city all you Men
[1:02:55] of War and go around about the city once
[1:02:59] and thou shalt do this six days
[1:03:04] okay
[1:03:07] so we're going to get up early in the
[1:03:08] morning and we're all going to go around
[1:03:11] the city one time for six days we're not
[1:03:15] going to say anything we're not going to
[1:03:18] whisper we're not going to talk we're
[1:03:21] going to go around the city and then go
[1:03:23] back to our tents
[1:03:25] and this is the strategy to defeat this
[1:03:28] place
[1:03:30] now let me revert back with you now if
[1:03:34] we were under the ministry of Joshua and
[1:03:37] it was us that heard this
[1:03:40] I wonder what some of you would say
[1:03:45] I wonder if some of y'all would say I'm
[1:03:47] wondering about brother Joshua I'll tell
[1:03:49] you one time I mean I have never heard
[1:03:51] I've been looking for quotes all day
[1:03:53] I've been looking for some reference
[1:03:55] that I can I can't find no reference to
[1:03:58] this that it's ever been done this way
[1:04:00] before
[1:04:01] or we shall we can trust this man
[1:04:06] now friends will sit there and look at
[1:04:07] me like you all a bunch angels
[1:04:09] people are the same they're the same
[1:04:12] then as they are today
[1:04:14] now they might not have said anything
[1:04:16] when they walked around the city but can
[1:04:18] you imagine when they go back to their
[1:04:19] tent can you believe this
[1:04:22] Lord have mercy we're learned we are
[1:04:26] learned I mean there's no hope for us
[1:04:29] Lord have mercy I never heard such a
[1:04:31] strategy in my entire life you've got to
[1:04:35] be kidding me and you were trusting this
[1:04:37] man to lead us to the promised land
[1:04:40] now notice in verse 4 and 7 priests
[1:04:43] shall bear before the ark seven Trumpets
[1:04:46] on Ram's horns
[1:04:48] but here they go seven priests and they
[1:04:51] have the Rams horns and their total
[1:04:54] mutes
[1:04:56] so whether they packed it by their side
[1:04:59] or whether they did like this we don't
[1:05:01] know
[1:05:02] but whatever they did the position that
[1:05:05] they had the horn not one sound
[1:05:09] came out of the horn
[1:05:11] it was almost as if God was trying to
[1:05:15] humiliate his people
[1:05:18] and make them look like they were a
[1:05:21] bunch of idiots
[1:05:26] ever been there and done that
[1:05:33] oh my
[1:05:34] on the Sabbath day you shall come past
[1:05:37] the city seven times and the priest
[1:05:40] shall blow with the trumpets and it
[1:05:42] shall come to pass on the make a long
[1:05:44] bless with the Rams Horn when you shall
[1:05:46] hear the sound of the trumpet all the
[1:05:48] people shall Shout with a great shout on
[1:05:51] the wall of the city shall fall down
[1:05:54] flat
[1:05:57] ah gotcha
[1:06:00] so we trample our feet and we Shout
[1:06:05] on a 20 foot thick wall
[1:06:08] is going to collapse
[1:06:11] you got that
[1:06:12] you got that
[1:06:13] you got that boy
[1:06:17] what about assistant you got that you're
[1:06:19] good with that
[1:06:24] it would have took a lot of faith
[1:06:27] to believe such a thing there was no
[1:06:30] quotes to refer back to
[1:06:32] there was no reference in their history
[1:06:35] oh I remember that yeah that happened
[1:06:37] before this had never happened before
[1:06:40] the message preachers that are called
[1:06:42] and anointed of God are preaching
[1:06:44] something to their congregations around
[1:06:46] the world today that has never happened
[1:06:49] before a mass Exodus of people coming up
[1:06:54] missing on the earth at one time
[1:06:58] they are preaching a phenomenal that old
[1:07:02] people will be setting like this or some
[1:07:04] of them will be at Walmart some will be
[1:07:07] at a restaurant some of them will be
[1:07:08] taken an afternoon Siesta until they eat
[1:07:11] their lunch and all of a sudden a sweep
[1:07:14] will come over the Earth and all of them
[1:07:16] will be changed back to 18 years old in
[1:07:20] a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[1:07:25] praise the Lord
[1:07:27] is there any reference to where this has
[1:07:31] happened globally before
[1:07:37] and yet you believe this
[1:07:40] God bless you
[1:07:41] me too
[1:07:45] oh notice verse 6 I'm Joshua the son of
[1:07:49] none called the priest and said to them
[1:07:51] take up the Ark of the Covenant let
[1:07:53] seven priests bear seven trumpets of
[1:07:55] Ram's horns notice how meticulous God is
[1:07:57] with his numerics
[1:07:59] and he said unto the people pass on and
[1:08:02] can pass the city and let them that his
[1:08:04] arm pass on before the Ark of the Lord
[1:08:06] and it came to pass when Joshua had
[1:08:09] spoken unto the people that the seven
[1:08:11] priests bearing the seven trumpets of
[1:08:13] Ram's horns passed on before the Lord
[1:08:15] notice this is the seventh day now and
[1:08:19] blue with the trumpets on the Ark of the
[1:08:22] Covenant of the Lord followed them so
[1:08:25] here we have the priests the preachers
[1:08:27] that are going out first
[1:08:29] it ain't no wonder the devil's trying to
[1:08:31] stop the preachers from preaching
[1:08:35] well praise the Lord
[1:08:37] but let him try let him do what he wants
[1:08:39] say let him say what he will God call
[1:08:42] man ain't never going to stop preaching
[1:08:44] the gospel
[1:08:46] um
[1:08:48] that's right
[1:08:50] and the armed men went before the priest
[1:08:53] that blew with the trumpets and the
[1:08:55] re-reward came out to the ark and the
[1:08:58] priests going on and blowing the
[1:09:00] trumpets and Joshua had commanded the
[1:09:02] people saying ye shall not shout
[1:09:07] nor make any
[1:09:10] noise
[1:09:11] with your voice
[1:09:15] neither shall any word
[1:09:18] proceed out of your mouth
[1:09:21] until the day I bid you shout
[1:09:28] that sounds like a controlling sort of
[1:09:30] an individual don't it
[1:09:36] y'all don't say a word
[1:09:39] until I tell you to
[1:09:43] imagine someone going back home
[1:09:46] oh he's a dominating thing ain't he
[1:09:49] who know the world as he think he is
[1:09:51] Joshua second in command
[1:09:54] that's who he knows he is
[1:09:56] so the Ark of the Lord come past the
[1:09:59] city going about it once
[1:10:02] they came into the camp
[1:10:05] enlarged
[1:10:07] praise the lord we got the victory
[1:10:10] Hallelujah
[1:10:12] that wasn't even dust fell down from
[1:10:14] between the mortar on the walls
[1:10:17] though and nothing happened
[1:10:19] day one zero results day two zero
[1:10:24] results day three day four day five day
[1:10:28] six
[1:10:29] zero results
[1:10:31] no sign
[1:10:33] a victory
[1:10:37] but the Seed of Abraham count those
[1:10:39] things that are not
[1:10:41] as though they are
[1:10:45] oh praise the Lord
[1:10:48] notice in verse 12 when Joshua Rose
[1:10:50] early in the morning
[1:10:52] the priests took up the Ark of the Lord
[1:10:54] notice verse 15 and it came to pass
[1:10:58] in the seventh churches
[1:11:01] or the seventh day
[1:11:03] they rose up early
[1:11:06] about the dawning of the day or as we
[1:11:09] would say at the rising of the Sun
[1:11:14] amen and Compass the city out to the
[1:11:17] same manner seven times only on that day
[1:11:21] amen only on that day
[1:11:25] they can pass the city seven times
[1:11:29] you imagine all them people of their
[1:11:32] life and and hollering and making fun of
[1:11:35] them out to the first stage you know
[1:11:36] they probably was in shock after the
[1:11:38] verse they said what in the world I
[1:11:39] ain't never seen nothing like this in my
[1:11:40] life so they get all their cameras and
[1:11:42] they go to posting YouTube videos as
[1:11:44] we'd say and they'll say look this is
[1:11:46] what's going on over there can you
[1:11:48] imagine that nothing happened nothing
[1:11:50] moved no sound they didn't say a word
[1:11:52] that's a miracle within itself that's
[1:11:55] some of the biggest long-term men and
[1:11:56] women ever lived in that group of people
[1:11:58] and they did not say one word
[1:12:02] this is part of their Victory following
[1:12:05] orders
[1:12:09] praise the Lord how many wants victory
[1:12:11] how many can follow orders of the world
[1:12:15] ah mama
[1:12:19] and it came to pass at the seventh time
[1:12:24] when the priests blew with the trumpets
[1:12:27] Joshua
[1:12:29] said unto the people
[1:12:34] shall
[1:12:36] oh
[1:12:38] so after this theophonic appearance
[1:12:43] came a shocked
[1:12:45] a voice
[1:12:47] and a trumpet
[1:12:50] Oh
[1:12:52] Glory I shout a voice and a trumpet all
[1:12:58] three of these appear remember the
[1:13:00] prophet said in Rapture all three of
[1:13:03] these happen when he's when he's when
[1:13:06] he's
[1:13:07] just send him
[1:13:11] praise the Lord
[1:13:14] Shout
[1:13:16] for the Lord has given you
[1:13:19] the city
[1:13:21] and the city shall be accursed even if
[1:13:24] all that are therein to the Lord oh Lord
[1:13:31] rehab
[1:13:33] have the Harlot
[1:13:36] shall live
[1:13:38] so the shout the voice and the trumpet
[1:13:42] and a gentile bride's name is called
[1:13:47] during the time of the shout the voice
[1:13:49] and the trumpet
[1:13:51] Hallelujah
[1:13:54] Oh Glory to God can you imagine how
[1:13:57] unworthy she must have felt that the
[1:13:59] mighty commander of the army of Israel
[1:14:02] is calling her name
[1:14:14] only Rey have the heart it shall live
[1:14:17] she
[1:14:20] and all that are with her
[1:14:22] in the house
[1:14:25] because
[1:14:27] she had on a long dress
[1:14:29] because she let her hair grow out
[1:14:32] because she quit wearing makeup
[1:14:35] because she hid
[1:14:37] The Messengers
[1:14:40] that we sent
[1:14:43] you mean her salvation
[1:14:46] was identified not only with that Court
[1:14:49] but because she give the true men of God
[1:14:53] a place of shelter
[1:14:58] that's not mine anointed and do my
[1:15:00] prophets no harm
[1:15:02] stand with God's anointed and when you
[1:15:04] get in trouble the anointing will stand
[1:15:06] with you
[1:15:08] stand again God's anointing and you're
[1:15:10] sinning against God
[1:15:11] this is what your Bible says right
[1:15:13] because she hid The Messengers that we
[1:15:18] sent
[1:15:19] so here they are now in day seven verse
[1:15:22] 20. so the people shouted when the
[1:15:25] priests blew with the trumpets and it
[1:15:29] came to pass when the people heard the
[1:15:32] sound of the trumpet
[1:15:37] so the trumpet sounded
[1:15:40] and there was a response among the
[1:15:42] people and the people shouted we've been
[1:15:46] changed
[1:15:49] we've been changed
[1:15:51] I'm standing there pulling my hair what
[1:15:53] a little better had left and it was gray
[1:15:55] and I was fixing to put my contacts in
[1:15:57] and I started right toward my album my
[1:16:00] contacts and all of a sudden I didn't
[1:16:01] need my contact no more and I got a new
[1:16:04] body and I got new hair and I got new
[1:16:06] strength and I got a new revelation we
[1:16:08] have been changed when the trumpet
[1:16:11] sounded the people began to shout out
[1:16:14] Hallelujah the Victory Is Ours
[1:16:19] [Applause]
[1:16:25] and the people shouted with a great
[1:16:28] Shout
[1:16:30] that the wall
[1:16:32] fell down flat
[1:16:37] wow
[1:16:41] I got this headline for you
[1:16:45] LSU fans
[1:16:48] create
[1:16:50] two Baton Rouge earthquakes
[1:16:54] and when
[1:16:56] over Alabama
[1:17:03] now this is true this happens yes what
[1:17:06] was it last week
[1:17:07] when LSU won the ball football right so
[1:17:11] what it is I trapped you didn't it yeah
[1:17:20] someone LSU won over Alabama
[1:17:25] the people started shouting
[1:17:29] and screaming and hollering
[1:17:33] and the Earth
[1:17:37] the earth started shaking
[1:17:40] can you imagine
[1:17:42] glory to God when the saints of God
[1:17:44] started going around that place and
[1:17:47] Joshua said now now
[1:17:51] and all of a sudden all around that
[1:17:54] whole city they started shouting they
[1:17:56] started worshiping they started praising
[1:17:59] God you imagine that old land around
[1:18:02] Jericho oh
[1:18:04] Hallelujah and the land begin to shake
[1:18:08] and Tremors went through the earth and
[1:18:11] the city began to shout around and the
[1:18:14] Bible sells the walls fell down flat why
[1:18:18] because the people of God needed a
[1:18:22] victory in their life
[1:18:23] [Applause]
[1:18:27] praise the Lord
[1:18:29] [Applause]
[1:18:36] ah
[1:18:39] praise and
[1:18:42] listen you know there's some of the
[1:18:44] excavations that they've done around
[1:18:46] the city there of Jericho
[1:18:49] they said it looks like
[1:18:51] a gigantic earthquake
[1:18:56] Hallelujah
[1:18:58] except it was not because that plate
[1:19:00] shifted under that plate and the great
[1:19:03] seismic graph of pressure down so and so
[1:19:06] and so it was simply the trumpets being
[1:19:08] blowed and they was following the
[1:19:10] direction of a god-ordained man of God
[1:19:12] and the saints of God started shouting
[1:19:15] they didn't shout because they felt like
[1:19:17] it they didn't shout because they felt
[1:19:19] more Victory they shouted because they
[1:19:21] were tall as Shout
[1:19:24] amen sometimes we need to clap our hands
[1:19:27] because we're told to clap them we need
[1:19:30] to say praise the Lord because we're
[1:19:33] told to clap them who knows your wall
[1:19:35] may come down who knows that sickness
[1:19:39] may leave your body
[1:19:42] amen
[1:19:43] [Applause]
[1:19:52] and they utterly destroyed
[1:19:55] all that was in the city
[1:19:58] find this
[1:20:00] amazing
[1:20:02] all these people living on the wall
[1:20:04] all these people in the city
[1:20:07] and it don't sound like hardly any of
[1:20:08] them died
[1:20:12] God done his part
[1:20:14] man wants them to do theirs
[1:20:17] you all ready
[1:20:22] look out devil
[1:20:24] here we come
[1:20:27] foreign
[1:20:30] but Joshua had said unto the two men
[1:20:35] that had spied out the country
[1:20:38] going to the harlot's house
[1:20:40] notice he didn't send him into the
[1:20:42] harlots Rubble
[1:20:46] they didn't have to send dogs to find
[1:20:48] her
[1:20:49] her house had floated down like a
[1:20:52] feather
[1:20:53] so here she's built between these two
[1:20:55] walls and these two walls are coming
[1:20:57] down crashing but my how in the world
[1:20:59] did they ever get that elevator
[1:21:01] underneath her house it's like it's
[1:21:03] settling down smoother than this Holiday
[1:21:05] Inn elevator going to first for the
[1:21:08] floor five and four six and four seven
[1:21:10] and all of a sudden you know she's
[1:21:11] saying mama don't worry Daddy don't
[1:21:14] worry brother don't worry child don't
[1:21:16] worry they gave me a promise and who
[1:21:18] them two men were they were two
[1:21:21] preachers
[1:21:30] I'll let you think on that
[1:21:36] what says the prophet said a lot to make
[1:21:38] mention of one woman here that I think
[1:21:40] of in the Bible
[1:21:42] she was bad to begin with rotten
[1:21:48] young beautiful woman by the name of
[1:21:50] Rahab
[1:21:52] she was a heathen
[1:21:54] a prostitute
[1:21:56] she heard there was a God not an idol
[1:22:01] that set down with the Declaration of
[1:22:03] Creeds but a God who lived among his
[1:22:06] people and anointed them with signs and
[1:22:09] wonders following
[1:22:12] let's think she was raised in a home
[1:22:14] that was real poor
[1:22:16] she become ill-famed she's a beautiful
[1:22:18] young woman
[1:22:19] she went into the streets to make her
[1:22:22] crippled mother and father a living no
[1:22:26] way to work only sell the morals of her
[1:22:29] body
[1:22:30] but I can imagine all the time she knew
[1:22:34] that was wrong
[1:22:36] there was something
[1:22:39] in her
[1:22:43] that told her
[1:22:46] glory to God
[1:22:48] this is not right and she knew it wasn't
[1:22:51] right
[1:22:52] but one day she heard there was a God
[1:22:55] moving and her heart began to tremble
[1:23:00] Oh Glory aren't you glad you can relate
[1:23:02] to the same experience
[1:23:04] notice this it goes on to say but all of
[1:23:07] a sudden
[1:23:08] a little preacher
[1:23:14] enters the city and said there's a God
[1:23:19] that lives
[1:23:21] Oh my he lived yesterday and he's the
[1:23:24] same yesterday today and forever he does
[1:23:26] the same works and when he did he was
[1:23:28] here on Earth his agents on the road now
[1:23:31] Rahab the Harlot was known as a hornet
[1:23:34] she was a type of the believer today
[1:23:39] the real believer
[1:23:42] she didn't say now if I can see Joshua
[1:23:45] do science because he's the successor of
[1:23:46] Moses and if I could see those signs
[1:23:48] I'll believe it
[1:23:50] he didn't have to absolutely show no
[1:23:52] signs at all because she believed it
[1:23:54] anyhow
[1:23:57] right have the heart we're all familiar
[1:23:59] with her
[1:24:00] young girl turned out on the street
[1:24:03] thy Heathen father and mother
[1:24:06] she was put there to bring an income to
[1:24:08] them
[1:24:09] from prostitution
[1:24:11] yet down in that immoral girl
[1:24:14] she had heard there was a god
[1:24:18] who answered prayer
[1:24:20] what was done in her well believe it or
[1:24:22] not same thing that was done inside of
[1:24:23] you and yours drinking smoking running
[1:24:25] around lying committing adultery doing
[1:24:27] all kinds of things what was it the
[1:24:29] dispersal of the seed of God
[1:24:33] notice verse 23 I'm the young man
[1:24:38] that were spies went in
[1:24:40] and brought out
[1:24:42] Rahab
[1:24:44] and their father and her mother and her
[1:24:47] Brethren and all that she had and they
[1:24:51] brought out all her kindred and left
[1:24:53] them without the camp of Israel and
[1:24:55] Joshua yahshua you remember what Jesus
[1:24:58] means in the New Testament Jehovah
[1:25:01] savior
[1:25:02] same thing Joshua means in the Hebrew of
[1:25:04] the Old Testament
[1:25:06] and Joshua saved Rahab the heart hell
[1:25:09] alive and her father's household and all
[1:25:11] that she had and she dwelleth in Israel
[1:25:14] even unto this day because she hid The
[1:25:21] Messengers
[1:25:24] now what I find amazing is
[1:25:27] she had already died
[1:25:30] by the time this was written
[1:25:34] but she still lived in Israel
[1:25:39] why it's part of who they were why is
[1:25:42] this story mean so much to us believe it
[1:25:45] or not it's still alive among us today
[1:25:47] while we can see our own lives
[1:25:50] portraying this one thing that I've
[1:25:51] noticed in this last time as I've been
[1:25:53] going through these five women in the
[1:25:55] lineage of the Lord Jesus typifying the
[1:25:57] church and the reconciliation of the
[1:25:59] Bride I found just in looking that have
[1:26:01] come to recognition to see that God
[1:26:03] wrote the life stories of these women
[1:26:05] into the very types of being the bride
[1:26:08] it's come from the back bad bad bad bad
[1:26:10] bad bad background from a very terrible
[1:26:13] situation prostitution whoredom all
[1:26:16] kinds of saying why God was writing the
[1:26:18] Kaleidoscope of who his people would be
[1:26:20] some of them would come from the dark
[1:26:23] regions of Africa others would come from
[1:26:25] the dark regions of the Church of God
[1:26:28] others would come from the dark regions
[1:26:30] of The Madness of the dark reasons of
[1:26:32] the Church of Christ and them's really
[1:26:33] dark regions but yet God would shine
[1:26:36] upon them and the predestinated seed
[1:26:39] would jump to Life One Day by the word
[1:26:41] and they would recognize who they are
[1:26:45] [Applause]
[1:26:51] let me close
[1:26:53] the prophet says it this way
[1:26:55] and why
[1:26:57] little Bethlehem
[1:27:00] and when she got the first message
[1:27:02] speaking about Rahab
[1:27:04] from them two preachers huh
[1:27:08] wow now wait a minute I thought brother
[1:27:10] Graham said that they were tape boys one
[1:27:13] and the same
[1:27:14] so the true tape boys are preachers
[1:27:18] either that or you got the prophet
[1:27:20] saying two different things which makes
[1:27:21] him a liar now you do what you want to
[1:27:23] it he said right here are the two
[1:27:25] preachers and then he said she had the
[1:27:26] tape boys so real true preachers are
[1:27:29] tape boys why they say what's the type
[1:27:31] say
[1:27:34] well praise the lord they're saying what
[1:27:36] the tapes say brother Branham did not
[1:27:39] say play what the tapes play but say
[1:27:42] what the tapes say come on now let's say
[1:27:45] it if we believe it say what the tapes
[1:27:49] say
[1:27:50] you can't say it if you don't open your
[1:27:52] mouth
[1:27:55] [Applause]
[1:28:01] so she got the message first from them
[1:28:04] two preachers
[1:28:05] that went over and quick because she
[1:28:07] accepted both all of her heart
[1:28:09] there was a scarlet cord bound at her
[1:28:11] wind I forgot my scarlet cord this
[1:28:13] morning because the last time I preached
[1:28:14] it brother Joel Brown wanted to you have
[1:28:16] it
[1:28:19] notice a scarlet cord bound at her
[1:28:22] window for a protection
[1:28:30] I'm so glad my hope
[1:28:32] it's not in a red wave
[1:28:36] let the Republicans is going to take
[1:28:38] over everything and they're going to
[1:28:39] make everything better
[1:28:42] well I imagine some of you are so sad
[1:28:45] my hope is not in politics
[1:28:49] I read it just this morning I knew news
[1:28:51] flies from Yahoo that said because the
[1:28:53] Democrats now have control of the Senate
[1:28:55] they will now be able to appoint more
[1:28:58] liberal judges and more liberal this and
[1:29:01] liberal that'll throw you out just
[1:29:02] exactly no doubt what they're supposed
[1:29:04] to do I'm not sure what you've done
[1:29:05] before the election but I prayed and
[1:29:07] prayed and prayed and said Lord whoever
[1:29:10] needs to be in there to bring the
[1:29:12] consummation the Rapture Let It Be
[1:29:15] come on children I'm not interested in a
[1:29:18] red wave today I'm interested in the red
[1:29:22] blood of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm not
[1:29:26] tied to a Republican party or a Democrat
[1:29:29] Party I've got my cord hanging out my
[1:29:32] window I want to be protected from
[1:29:35] laodicea
[1:29:43] oh
[1:29:46] the prophet said God look down
[1:29:50] when the rash fell and the trumpets
[1:29:53] began to blow
[1:29:55] God seemed the scarlet cord
[1:29:58] hanging there as a memorial
[1:30:01] it's always pleasing to pass over the
[1:30:04] blood
[1:30:05] when I see the blood I'll pass over you
[1:30:08] when the shaking and the Holy Spirit
[1:30:10] rumbled the Earth
[1:30:13] shook down them walls
[1:30:16] some 20 feet thick not one rock
[1:30:22] fell where that Court
[1:30:25] shows the protection
[1:30:27] of a true God
[1:30:30] to a True Believer
[1:30:35] you say A True Believer can look at life
[1:30:37] in battles this way
[1:30:40] it tricks the will of God for me to be
[1:30:42] going through a tremendous trial and
[1:30:44] battle and test so sickness maybe
[1:30:47] disease has struck her body
[1:30:49] you're just as safe
[1:30:51] in that trial as you would be out of it
[1:30:55] with all the skies blue and the sunlight
[1:30:58] coming around you why you're in the will
[1:31:01] of God
[1:31:05] as a matter of fact one of our great
[1:31:06] generals who followed the type of Joshua
[1:31:09] said he was just as safe
[1:31:12] on the battlefield
[1:31:14] as he was at home in his bed a
[1:31:20] listen boy I could understand that this
[1:31:21] day and time you know you ain't safe
[1:31:23] nowhere are you
[1:31:24] but can you imagine bullets flying by
[1:31:27] you your enemy looking nice you got
[1:31:29] their scope on you washing for you but
[1:31:31] you're just as safe if that's the will
[1:31:33] of God for you is if you are in your
[1:31:35] home head down in your basement
[1:31:36] somewhere let me just tell you if it's
[1:31:38] the will of God for you to go through a
[1:31:40] test go through a trial go through a
[1:31:42] sickness or a disease and God will bring
[1:31:44] you out on the other side you're just as
[1:31:46] safe in that trial but you say brother
[1:31:48] Donnie it's a tumor it's this out of the
[1:31:50] other but the hand of God if it's the
[1:31:53] hand of God that has allowed you to be
[1:31:55] that don't you know the hand of God will
[1:31:56] bring you out on the other side
[1:31:59] you're just as safe as long as you're in
[1:32:03] God's will
[1:32:08] praise the Lord
[1:32:11] praise the Lord
[1:32:16] and we know that Rahab
[1:32:18] marries one of these
[1:32:20] spies according to the Jewish tradition
[1:32:23] and the law of what they say whose name
[1:32:25] was cell Moon
[1:32:28] who became the founder of of the place
[1:32:31] called Beth aleham
[1:32:34] the house
[1:32:36] of God's bread
[1:32:39] to what a gentile
[1:32:42] whose past was horrible
[1:32:45] no doubt she remembered and reminisced
[1:32:48] just like some of us have done of our
[1:32:50] failures and our shortcomings
[1:32:53] before God
[1:32:55] but you know what it proves to me we do
[1:32:57] not have to be ruled by our past
[1:33:01] and the dictates of those things which
[1:33:03] are behind us
[1:33:05] don't never my friends underestimate the
[1:33:08] power of Amazing Grace
[1:33:11] who would have ever thought God could
[1:33:13] have taken a woman like this a woman
[1:33:16] like Tamar
[1:33:18] a woman like Bathsheba
[1:33:21] and be able to interwove them in the
[1:33:24] very human genealogy of our Lord Jesus
[1:33:28] if you understood the writings of the
[1:33:30] genealogies you know that when a woman
[1:33:33] was a foul woman
[1:33:35] they would not even allow her name to be
[1:33:38] written associated with a clean man if
[1:33:43] her father was a righteous man her name
[1:33:45] was not absolutely forbidden to be wrote
[1:33:49] in connection with him
[1:33:51] because her reproach would bang shame
[1:33:54] upon his name
[1:33:56] you don't see what the grace of God is
[1:33:58] when you read the book of Matthew in the
[1:33:59] Book of Luke when you read the name
[1:34:02] Tamar you read the name of ruse or
[1:34:07] Hallelujah and Rahab
[1:34:10] and in Matthew he doesn't even record
[1:34:11] the name Bathsheba
[1:34:14] but her which was the wife of Uriah
[1:34:19] you don't realize what Grace you're
[1:34:21] reading because according to their
[1:34:23] genealogy they should not even be
[1:34:25] identified in the records of the law
[1:34:31] but the grace of God reached down to
[1:34:34] them
[1:34:34] not only put them in the records of the
[1:34:37] law
[1:34:37] but allowed them to be written in the
[1:34:39] genealogy of the Lord Jesus himself
[1:34:44] I don't know about you there's a few
[1:34:45] folks in my family I wouldn't want you
[1:34:47] all to look up
[1:34:51] you think my face has seen a lot on on
[1:34:52] YouTube well there's a few folks in my
[1:34:55] family oh I know I'm sure the only one
[1:34:57] that's got them everyone else got Angels
[1:34:58] the rest your family right
[1:35:01] oh I see
[1:35:03] you see in my family's bank robbers and
[1:35:05] liars and all that sort of thing they
[1:35:07] chummed up at some of your family oh
[1:35:13] but the grace of God reached to us
[1:35:16] beyond our DNA our maternal side our
[1:35:20] paternal side
[1:35:21] and reach to the seed of God
[1:35:24] which was down in our
[1:35:34] oh Jesus how we thank you today for your
[1:35:37] mercy
[1:35:39] we thank you for your grace to us father
[1:35:43] oh what a great great thing
[1:35:46] you have down down Through the Ages
[1:35:50] we love you today Father
[1:35:53] we know it's the slowly unfolded mystery
[1:35:56] of God
[1:35:59] sometimes it was written right out plain
[1:36:02] where people would be able to see it
[1:36:04] other times it was hidden and the lives
[1:36:08] of people
[1:36:10] that were very unlikely candidates
[1:36:13] to receive such Glory
[1:36:17] which of us would have ever picked a
[1:36:20] woman like Tamar
[1:36:22] to address as a prostitute
[1:36:25] to Allure her father-in-law
[1:36:28] into an illicit relationship
[1:36:32] but she didn't do it
[1:36:34] for The Thirst of lust
[1:36:36] had it not been for her the seed of
[1:36:40] Judah
[1:36:41] would have died
[1:36:44] there was not another alive to carry on
[1:36:49] or as it went on in time the only
[1:36:51] genealogy left
[1:36:53] would come to her
[1:36:55] so we find that the very human genealogy
[1:36:58] of our Lord Jesus
[1:37:00] when God pronounced
[1:37:03] there will be none
[1:37:05] of this side of David
[1:37:08] of this particular son's reign
[1:37:11] none of them shall ever set on the
[1:37:13] throne again
[1:37:15] and yet the line is the line of the
[1:37:18] tribe
[1:37:19] of Judah
[1:37:21] I'm not sure if they understand Lord
[1:37:24] both Joseph and Mary
[1:37:27] are from David
[1:37:31] it would have been a failure
[1:37:33] through the one side
[1:37:35] but you always have a safety net
[1:37:39] an absolute
[1:37:40] that will prevent Satan from stopping
[1:37:43] your plan
[1:37:45] Lord I love you today I'm so thankful
[1:37:47] for sovereignty
[1:37:49] we would have messed up so many times
[1:37:53] we would have totally ruined the program
[1:37:55] of God
[1:37:57] but whenever we mess up so bad
[1:38:00] you reserve that little space of
[1:38:02] sovereignty where you can step in and
[1:38:05] say get out of the way let me fix your
[1:38:07] mess
[1:38:09] thank you Lord God
[1:38:11] thank you Lord God
[1:38:13] we love you Jesus
[1:38:16] but any of us have ever chose Ruth
[1:38:19] would have any of us ever chose Rahab
[1:38:23] Bathsheba
[1:38:24] through that Union
[1:38:27] yet Lord God
[1:38:29] he was projecting salvation grace and
[1:38:32] mercy
[1:38:33] in the Old Testament written thousands
[1:38:35] of years ago
[1:38:37] thank you Lord Jesus and now here we are
[1:38:40] we have people in our assembly
[1:38:43] who believe this word had come for the
[1:38:45] background
[1:38:46] from Rahab
[1:38:48] some of the background like Ruth
[1:38:51] some of the background like Tamar
[1:38:55] Canaanites heathens idolaters
[1:39:00] but Lord God today saved by the grace of
[1:39:03] God
[1:39:05] saved by your mercy Lord
[1:39:08] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:39:10] and we are so saved
[1:39:13] that we are the crowning success of
[1:39:17] calvary
[1:39:18] as they were the crowning success of the
[1:39:21] Old Testament
[1:39:23] Matthew wrote of one genealogy Luke
[1:39:27] wrote of the other
[1:39:29] bringing most of them together and the
[1:39:31] human embodiment of Our Lord
[1:39:34] it was the Fulfillment and the
[1:39:36] protection of the Lion of the tribe
[1:39:40] of Judah
[1:39:42] Lord God
[1:39:43] today we are your
[1:39:46] she brought
[1:39:49] and your word is written in our lives
[1:39:52] is your name is written in our hearts
[1:39:56] Lord God we bring our needs before you
[1:39:58] today Father
[1:40:00] I know we got a lot of things going on a
[1:40:02] lot of sickness viruses all kinds of
[1:40:03] different things Lord

[1:40:11] very very serious things going on in
[1:40:12] their lives
[1:40:14] Lord Jesus help us
[1:40:16] to be patient and wait on you
[1:40:19] help us to know sometimes you want us to
[1:40:21] shout
[1:40:22] other times you want us to listen
[1:40:24] sometimes you want us to March and say
[1:40:26] not a word
[1:40:27] day one day two day three up to day six
[1:40:30] and then on day seven we go to heaven a
[1:40:33] Time
[1:40:34] Hallelujah help us to be sensitive to
[1:40:37] your leadership Lord Jesus
[1:40:40] help me as the leader of your people
[1:40:42] father that I can be sensitive to
