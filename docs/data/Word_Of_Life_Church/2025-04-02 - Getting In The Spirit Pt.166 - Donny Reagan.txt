brother the other day 40 years ago ago when I came to the message the The Cry of everyone was I just heard brother bam say it the other day and that made me think of it we're resting on that when he went beyond the curtain there wasn't no Corrections he needed that somebody the angel had to say no brother Brown that what you didn't preach that like Paul did so I'm still resting on it just like he preached it Ain you are you disappointed are you desperate for hell you know what it's like to be tired and only a shell of yourself you start to believe you don't have what it takes cuz it's all you

might be before I get done preaching right here tonight praise the lord well didn't the Lord give us some awesome meetings this [Applause] week I just so want to say again how much I appreciated our brothers coming and all the visitors of course that came and all the work that you all did all the sisters all all the brothers um just everybody made it made it such a wonderful thing so appreciate it I want to share a little something with you tonight before we read the scripture brother Ron Spencer got a clean brain scan report yesterday Hallelujah I was so happy to hear that brother David silard shared something with a couple of us ministers this week that a sister in his church had come up for prayer Sunday he left Saturday evening and went home Sunday and um they found a 3in mask like in her body and she went back for some more scans I guess it was yesterday and it was gone hallelujah we're living in great days friends it's in Troublesome times we know that and it's it's difficult times but our God is moving Among Us I'm so glad that we we don't have to warm by a painted fire I'm so glad that we don't have to point back well I remember he used to I remember he used to I remember he used to or look forward one day one day but we can say right now right now he's doing it praise the Lord let's turn tonight if you would to Genesis 24:1 17 I hope if when I grow up to be a preacher the Lord either lets me preach like Brother David or brother Dan or somebody um I'm still growing of course and hope one day man I just listen to God's gifts and I think it isn't God amazing how he gifts people and preachers and it's just um it's just awesome to me the way that the Lord does and preachers will study something and you think I just read that yeah so I realize there's preachers around the message that feel like they have the ultimate understanding of everything um and apparently they never listen to nobody else other than their s you know but it's just it's just absolutely amazes me brother Dan daa used to say that God's gifts are like Lifesavers they come in all different flavors and whenever you hear the diversity of the way that God uses men you just realize it's amazing what he does and you know why he does it for us for us we're blessed aren't we and I can I can tell you right now brother David and brother Danny both enjoyed being here brother Danny told me several times and so did Brother David how they sort of enjoyed being here at the church of course brother David's been here different times through the years but this is Brother Danny's first time and he just said over and over again how much he enjoyed being here and thank you for that I told him I said well I've tried my best to convey it to the people that they have a great part to play and how any service goes and he said you have done it well so I hope I have Genesis 24:17 and the servant ran to meet her and said let me I pray thee drink a little water of thy picture and she said drink my Lord and she she hasted and let down her picture upon her hand so now it was upon her shoulder and she lets it down upon her hand as a form of custom complimentary custom not set it on the ground well if you want it get it but it was a mannerism in the way that she actually even gave him to drink now remember he's watching every move listening to every word how would you like to have had this responsibility to pick a bride for the prince Isaac and when you took her home it made no difference what she looked like 382 lb or 28 lbs whatever you took home was who he's going to marry that's a tough responsibility so he's watching he's waiting he's listening every little move he'd watch her mannerism now watch in verse 19 and when she had done giving him drink she said I will draw water for thy camels also until they have done drinking now remember this is what he told the Lord in prayer and she hasted and emptied her picture into the trough and ran again onto the well to draw water and Drew for all his camels remember how many trips it was 60 60 not to a whale with a garden hose there but a well that was dug down in the earth going down steps up and down the them steps for at least 60 times with haste now remember he's watching you understand that the Lord is watching us he watches us when we come to church the angels of God watch how we participate they watch how we live they watch how we treat people whether good or bad they're watching she hasted and emptied her picture into the trough and ran again into the well to draw water and Drew for all his camels now listen what he does and the man wondering wondering at her held his peace so he's wondering and pondering is this her is this the answer to my prayer to Whit whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not I mean do that to be remembered tonight as we pray Harry and I have a family member back in Kentucky that would' like for you to remember tonight you don't need to know all the details necessarily but just that God God will move we um certainly have different ones in our church that are sick and still dealing with different things so we want to pray for them and let's pray for the word pray for me tonight if you would the Lord will help me heavenly father I believe with all of my soul as the angel of God spoke to Rebecca that day every member of the bride of Christ around the world will hear from the angel of God they will feel a pull from another world they will hear a voice they will hear the word they will identify with something that's even beyond their Earthly family they will be misunderstood by the reaction to that voice it will change their lives and one day their bodies we are privileged blessed people by your presence not only to have your book we have your book and then you send us your Prophet you send us your spirit your token and you send us the angel of God we thank you for that Lord I pray that you would help each of us Lord Lord you see all these needs you heard these requests Lord that I even mentioned I pray that you'd be mindful Lord God we just want to thank you tonight we want to Rejoice Lord Jesus that our brother Ron father heard this great report and the the first word that he said that the doctor was saying as he walked through the door was Miracle it's a miracle well that's our God he's a miracle working God so father take the service tonight you see our needs our desires speak to us I pray father in the name of Jesus and the Saints said amen amen God bless you you may be seated let's let's read again there verse verse 21 and the man wondering at her held his peace so he doesn't say anything he doesn't give her any hints any clues moving this way do this go that way do this in order to be chosen respond like this and act this certain way he's not saying any of that but what he's doing is watching and observing you know that's a very good thing for all all of us to do in life you're looking for a mate that's what you need to do you need to watch them see how they do about the word see how they do in church see how they respond to the things of God how they respond to other people you don't have to really say a whole lot a lot of times all you got to do is just watch people and we are creatures of habit we do habitual things over and over again and it's the unconscious things that I watch that tells me about people really who they are not whenever they're you know they're watching their p's and q's as we say and they know you're watching them then most all of us are going to be on our best behavior then that's not really what I want to see I want to see what they are under stress I want to see what they are just by their natural reaction whenever they don't think anybody else is watching them now this is what he's doing now he knows that Abraham has given him this great sacred charge but he cannot tell her yet so the mystery must be acted out on her part and the angel of God wants her to act it out but he wants it to be by natural behavior so he didn't give her a book and just say now look do this way dress that way act this Bend this way curtsy bow your head do a certain certain thing but he wants her just to be as she is the type of person that she is so the man wondering at her so what what do you think that he observed her courteous Behavior now she didn't know him from The Man in the Moon as we say first time she had ever seen him he could have been a robber he could have been a see she could tell by the camels by the substance that she could see slave servants there with him that at least he represented someone of great importance of someone of substance that she could tell but she didn't know whether he was a good man sincere man honest man but she treated him and that which was natural to her and her behavior which was what not curious I not mean not evil spirited but courteous and kind you know myself I I think that courteous can be handed down to people that don't even deserve it I think kindness can be handed to people that in reality we think they don't even deserve my kindness but you know what the way I look at it if I'm kind and I'm I'm mild-tempered and whatever more I'm not just going to express that to kind people that's who I am so that's what I'm I'm going to be was no matter who I deal with you understand now watch what he's looking for and remember this great charge now that Abraham is sending him out there and he's prayed a prayer and he's waiting to see if God has made the prayer manifest cuz he doesn't know just yet now she's reacted to what he prayed but he still wants to see that her character matches what he else had as for so he watches her kindness her courteousness and to a stranger her humility in the way that she would go down and get the water the way she would come back up excuse me and the way that she would bow down like this and hand the man on her hand so she'd take the bottom of the picture in this part of her hand like this and take the other end over this way and make it instead of setting it down on the ground and say you get if you want against yourself but she would actually serve him the water as if though he was a great person a person of renown because little did she know he really was so her condens now watch her condens that she took upon herself her Readiness and her ability to be able to serve someone that that she did not know as I read about a certain black man that went into a hotel and he went up to the front desk and he asked this lady behind the desk if she had any rooms and she said um no sir we don't and I don't have time for you and she was quite rude to the man and uh he he gave her a little bit of Grace and said well would you mind checking again just to make sure I told you we do not have any rooms so the man pulls out his ID and shows her he's the owner of the hotel now he did not come in on a limousine he was just dressed in casual looking clothes you know it's no wonder that the Bible tells us to be careful how we treat people because sometimes we're Entertaining Angels unawares now notice how this comes natural to Rebecca and elaser must have been a pretty good reader of human character so he he sees her Readiness and her diligence and all this now is taking I want you to notice that nothing about her shape her form her figure how pretty she was her hair was either blonde or black her eyes were blue or brown or Hazel none of that is even mentioned now wouldn't he want the most beautiful woman in the land the most beautiful woman in the land might not be the best woman in the land come on but what is he noticing he's noticing these attitudes that she has and would she make his master an ID ideal wife now that's the thing that true men of God are really called for to minister to the bride now listen to me children and don't misunderstand what I'm going to say I feel like it is very important for us as the people of God to listen to the tapes of the Prophet messenger for us to read the books for us to study and I believe if you really believe the message of the hour that there's something in you that you want to to do that but you realize also reading and listening to tapes is not enough you must have your own walk with God going to church is not enough saying brother Donnie is my pastor brother Danny is my pastor Brother David that's not enough we want to have a character and traits about our Behavior s days a week when we're out of church in Church on the parking lot you know wherever we are at Walmart to where the Holy Ghost can watch us where we are and when we are by ourself we act exactly the same way we don't take our phone out and go to places we shouldn't go on that phone when we're by oursel and act totally different when our wife is around or brother Donnie would be there or you know one of the deacons would be there because that's not Who We Are oh my I'm going to have the type of behavior that the spirit of God can make the report about me daily that I have behaved myself since the special meetings now and the last one when we close out on Sunday that whenever we got back to our regular routine on Monday as probably a lot of us did and then on Tuesday and on on today that the spirit of God could report the same thing about me Monday Tuesday and Wednesday as he did while the special meetings were going on because I'm not going to act more special when special meetings are going on because I believe I'm a special person anyway so if I believe that I'm specially called of God you believe you are then you know what I believe I should act special every day of my life I'm not just going to act special when special meetings are going on I'm going to act special every day that I live well praise the Lord now watch notice that he must have noticed something about how quick she was you notice how that when Moses writes this many years later that he talks about the adjectives and the adverbs that describes how fast she moved quickly she hastened she ran notice this about her behavior so this is what is also sticking out so she didn't do a Google search on this guy and see if there was some type of a scam warning that a guy with a bunch of camels is going from whale to wh and trying to dke people so everybody watch your virgin daughters because there's a scam they're tell telling that this guy's going around well she had no way of checking that out she did know you know okay let me pray about this and I'll come back in three days and I'll let you know but immediately she responded now we know why that she did this it was not because that she so much had a great discernment of character it was not so much that she had the word to go by remember there was no written word there was not even an oracle from God given to them in padan har there was no message book that had been sent over there for her to identify with this is why God sent her an angel now he was trying to identify by her expressions and that because he had placed a token before God and what he wants to see is the counterpart of that token the identification of those traits to see was it in her before he said anything about it now he's trusting the Providence of God so the servant was evaluating Rebecca just very nonchalant no doubt and just watching and beholding not saying anything to see if she would make his master a good wife now notice in verse 22 and it came to pass as the camels had done drinking now watch that that the man took a golden earring of half a shekele weight and two bracelets for her hands of 10 shackles weight of gold now no preaching has been done no signs have been done but the gift goes to working on her after she has displayed her female counterpart of the token now he doesn't say anything yet so he doesn't preach a sign message he doesn't preach anything but he gives her the gifts and the gifts amen are displayed on her by her actions listen I love the way the prophet explains this so why did Rebecca make that sudden move why did she go to the Waters of life so quickly why could the angel speak to her glory to God because she was blood relation to Isaac and that's who the angel can speak to tonight is a blood relation now do you realize out of all the billions of people that are on the face of the Earth today that the angel of God if you are bride if you are bride predestinated and your name is on that Lamb's Book of Life and it hasn't happened to you yet it will but for many of you it has already happened the angel of God has spoken to you and called your name and draw your attention to this Elie eer call in the last days now you might be the only one in your family you may suffer great persecution because of the word and you may be asked to leave all and go and follow something that seems heretical to the world but all you know is there's something down on the inside of you and it's like you have no other alternative praise be to God now the reason is it's the exact same reason that the angel of God went to to her now remember it was at the evening time that the virgins went out to get well water from the well so no doubt there was many different ones that maybe had come before her maybe after her one church after another one move after another after another but the angel of God only went to her and it went to her before she ever met elaser now think of it why did he go to her she was blood relation to Isaac but the thing of it is she didn't even know it yet praise be to God now watch by the blood we are born into the body of Christ re Rebecca and Isaac amen own cousin by both fathers which made them blood relation and the bride of Christ is Sanctified through the blood of Christ and an open vessel for the Holy Spirit to speak to he goes on to say she made her decisions quick watch her real quick then in the meeting quickly if they're ordained to eternal life they'll know it there's something in the message that stirs them there's something in the message that stirs them how many knows what I'm talking about tonight something in the message that stirs them that's what stirred Rebeca the message stirred her the angel was leading her Oh Glory to God can't you see her picture the angel of the Lord leading her then she was stirred and immediately when she watered the camel the gift went on her so when she Waters the camel the Holy Spirit then the gift went on her now want you to notice that she does not stop elaser and begin to explain to him how the gifts should be operated but she actually let him put the gifts in order where they needed to be she didn't take the gift off of her ear and put it around her leg which they did wear them right above their ankle she did not take the bracelets off of her wrist and wire one on this ear and one on that ear and say you know what I like them better out of the room I like them out here where everybody can see them so I I'm going to rearrange these gifts H well glory to God you're quiet on me tonight but you know what she apparently she just believed that if this man had the order of the gifts he would not tell her the wrong way for her to use them now remember Rebecca believed in the gifts well I believe God's Rebecca today still believes in the gifts I hope with all of my heart we see the real genuine gifts of the Holy Ghost manifested in our church before we go on the rapture and the bride said I ain't talking about just the three vocal ones I'm talking about the other six which probably L the message people don't even what they are but I figure that all nine gifts are important not just tongues interpretation and prophecy come on somebody say Amen with me tonight now you know the gift of God the messenger restores and with this comes this restoration and it was not the gifts remaining only on him or in his possession but he come bearing gifts and the gifts was not actually for the foolish virgin type so they're not for her Maids but the gifts were for Rebecca praise the Lord now even though her mother and her brother received gifts they did not receive the wedding gifts now listen to me me I don't just want oh my I don't want just gifts that are shouting and jumping and running and so on all you got to do is tap in on YouTube and you'll see Pentecost running jumping shouting carrying on all of that I ain't got nothing against that but if that's a sign of bride Revival what about all them with all their earbobs and their ears and bobbed hair and everything else you be to tell me that's a bride's Revival in the UPC Church and they hate this message come on on somebody I don't just want what the Pentecostals God I want that plus plus amen I believe that God has a people on the Earth that the angel of God can speak to now notice he said the gift went on her he be to take out the earrings and notice what the earrings represented he begin to take out the earrings which means face cometh by hearing you see and put the bracelet on which is the work of your hands so what were the bracelet it was the crowning or the identification that the works that she had done 60 trips up and down that well watering him watering the camels gold has now come upon them and crowned The Works of her hands and then faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God so Faith don't come by hearing and then questioning well I don't understand that and I don't think it should be done that way I I I don't I don't agree with that that's not what Rebecca done and Rebecca did not have a theological debate with elzer and S out why why are you doing this because you was a Baptist I don't understand why you preach that how come you preach that seed of the serpent stuff how come you to come up of that ill e or have to come back and say I never come up of the serpent seat it was actually the serpent himself that fathered the seat it wasn't me so it had to point back and say that's right in the Bible Rebecca imagine Rebecca debating with him well I'll tell you one thing I was baptized in titles I don't understand why in the world I've got to be baptized in the name of Isaac I don't see what in the world I've got to get rid of my britches for what in the world I have to get rid of my my makeup and my mascara and us men why do we have to get quck wearing our shorts and why do men have to get cut the locks off of their hair and we're not living in the days of abson some of your brothers but Men supposed to have their hair cut well praise the Lord I don't imagine Rebecca got into a big theological debate over to her daddy's house and said I'll tell you one thing I want to know how you part your hair and I want to know where your home church is and I want to know how you baptize and I'm going to sort through but what my daddy said my grandpa said and if you don't say what they say I ain't taking what you said he'd have left her right there with her water pot in her hand well Glory now notice put the bracelets on the works of your hands he got her ready and as soon as she begin to water give the Waters of Life testify tell others get the message out tell them what has happened to you now I want you to notice now he's moving from one stage to another from Faith to Faith as it was and with each thing that is asked and each thing that is going on it's opening up for us a type in the end time watch verse 23 and he said who daughter art thou whose daughter art thou tell me I Praise Him is there room in thy father's house for us to Lodge in can we come and have a few days meetings cuz there might be some seed in there that we want to pull out that denominational mess well praise the Lord uh is there room in your church where maybe we could come in and have a meeting Oh Glory who's daughter art thou now all of these are very pertinent to his mission of coming for all of this distance now and he's got to find out who she is now he SE this sign yeah she said Amen to that he's seen that amen amen she said but he's got to now come to her lineage Oh Glory whose daughter art thou now the reason of this question is by the answer that he would know whether she was of the family related to Abraham or not now he's not using discernment to tell her but he wants her to tell him who are you where do you come from what's your paternal side and I also want to know your maternal side so she she's got to identify who she is to be identified as being a wife for Isaac now this is going to bring a greater measure of satisfaction tell me I praise it is a room in thy father's house this also is going to tell him what kind of a father she has is he a man of means now remember the way that they looked at marriage it was a joining together and a merging together of families so they wouldn't want to marry one family to another family that would not seem F fitting and comely so by her answer he will know further if she is the one and the connection will be more pure and divine she said unto him I am the daughter of bethuel the son of Mila which she bore unto nahor I want you to notice he does not tell her how to answer he does not tell her in which order to answer in the paternal side or the maternal side or the grandfather's side but now she's speaking Glory out of the value of her patronage listen carefully and she said unto him I am the daughter of bethuel the son of Mila which she be unto nahor now it's not just important that she identifies who her daddy is but she wants her maternal side also to be identified with the wife of high order you see for many of these men they practice polygamy or they would take concubines and she wanted to trace her ID idty even back on the maternal order that she was of the church which was of the highest order in the land so you couldn't just believe whatever you wanted to believe and go ahead and go in the Rapture and be in the bride and just pick any mother any church that you wanted well they're all the same well a lot of them out there may be the same but the brides is not I am the daughter of Betha so she noticed her first identif ation is who her father is I am the daughter of bethuel the son of milka so she doesn't mention her mother first but she mentions his mother so I am the daughter of bethuel the son of Mila which she bear unto nahor Mila was my grandmother and nahor was my grandfather and Oh Glory bethuel was my father so Rebecca mentions her father's mother to show that she had descended from a Highborn wife so she was not of a concubine lineage in other words she wasn't foolish virgin she didn't just belong to a church and said well I'm in the message and I listen to tapes every day that ain't no more than just man a concubine if you ain't born again so the servant now listen he's listening to her reply of her patronage he's listening what value does she put upon her birth and where she come from so looks at her father's side traces him back to the Highborn wife and then traces him right over to the very kin to Abraham on what side the father's side but also on the mother's side so she's identifying herself as Isaac's cousin so milka being the daughter of harand which is Abraham's brother so milka was actually glory to God friends can't you see the real bride the bride is in direct lineage from the Lion of God so it's not like that the Bride is a church prostitute that's taken out and God's trying to bring children by by bonds made don't you see why we are so against man-made religion and man-made ideology that God wants every one of us to have our own births we are more than Reagans we are more than Wards we're more than Perry's we're more than Swanson's and bentons we God wants us to be able to take our identity back I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God I'll have the Holy Ghost I've been Sanctified I'm a born again child of God I'm born of the word of God by Malachi 4 that's who I am I belong to the right church I go to the right Church Hallelujah and she is my mother Hallelujah to God I belong to the right bunch am amen Mila being the daughter of haran Abraham's brother now when he knew that she fulfilled all these conditions Oh Glory then he now identifies her to go to her house now watch the servant is now interested in her her family but the the the question has a broader application to us as Believers so now I want to move from Rebecca and I want to ask you who are you who are you are you just a human or just a mortal that's down here trying to struggle for life and and trying to go to a place that you've never been and and maybe God somehow will have mercy on you and you'll be able to find the way and you'll stumble around here in this darkness is that what you think you are who are you and St John 3 verse three Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God look at the word again it means from above from the first from the first from a higher place from the beginning now brother sister this is the way the true Rebecca believes the new birth you're born from the beginning from a higher place from the first don't have remember this is Jesus the first one to mention this Doctrine this is his first Doctrine the prophet said that he mentioned in the New Testament was being born again so being born again is from above from the first from a higher place from the beginning now I realize that we're living in a great world and especially usse year in the Bible Belt word being born again or so called being born again Christian belonging to church it's it's a big thing for people to say it oh yeah I'm born again I go to church I'm born again I'm a Christian and yet you get around some of them that say that they drink I was talking to someone just last week and they were they were supposedly born again and yet living with their girlfriend now there would nobody of course that comes to our church but yet living with their girlfriend and claiming to be born again or a Christian and you realize that's where the church has come to and they think nothing about it and and and Christians drink as a matter of fact I seen a former a picture of a former message preacher some time ago and sat there with shorts on and a beer can in his hand a man that is stood in the pull pit around the world and preach the message of the hour well you know the problem was he never was born again well come on following the message and being born again is not always the same thing that's exactly right now Jesus Jesus said you must be born from the first or from the beginning now let's Trace then our patronage from the word of God are we just here as creatures of time and we're trying to do the very best we can and we really don't know if we're saved or not and we really don't know if we'll even make it or not and then somehow at the end of the way we wait till we get over Yonder uh-uh that's not the Plan of Salvation my God has we can know beyond the shadow of a doubt that we have passed from Death un life look in Luke 22:31 and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but I have prayed for thee that thy face notice this thy face fail not now Peter failed Peter's bragging fail Jesus didn't pray his bragging wouldn't fail he prayed his face would fail is that right now listen what he tells this preacher which had preached the message cast out Devils heal the sick had great signs and wonders listen and when thou art converted so Peter had accepted the Lord Jesus as his savior he was one of the very few people that ever lived on the earth that the Lord Jesus personally baptized him in water and he still still wasn't converted why you don't get converted you get the Holy Ghost well praise the Lord now so Jesus tells him when you are converted when you turn around I want you to strengthen your brethren watch acts 19:1 and it came to pass while Apollos was at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper Coast came to Ephesus finding certain disciples now listen to this carefully finding certain disciples now these people are being disciplined to follow a message of a prophet of God they are disciples and the word Disciples of course comes from the Greek word word which is disciplined so they were walking a certain walk talking a certain talk behaving a certain way now listen this finding certain disciples and he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since sins ye believed it's amazing when the prophet quotes this scripture reads it he says these were good Baptists and they thought they got it when they believed well a lot the message folks believe the same thing now want you notice how Paul separated believing from receiving the Holy Ghost now these false preachers in this day that's telling their church members that when you you come up and accept Christ as your savior and you're born again that's a lie amen according to the Bible I said according to the Bible come on Rebecca can you say Amen am have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe and they said unto him we've not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost now you know who they were following the teaching of John the Baptist the man who forrun the coming of the Lord Jesus but they were two dispensations behind John had come introduced the Lord Jesus another dispensation the Lord Jesus lived and died went up into heaven the Holy Ghost come back which is another dispensation and they were two dispensations behind they hadn't even heard I find this so amazing to me because the Prophet they were following had the Holy Ghost before he was even born amen yes he did and they hadn't even heard about it apparently they had not listened to the Holy Ghost series had they praise the Lord they hadn't even heard about the Holy Ghost and their Prophet had it before he was born oh my now watch and he said unto them andto what then were you back baptize them they said under John's baptism and then Paul John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people they should believe on him which should after come on him that is on Christ Jesus so John did not baptize using a name he didn't say Jesus he didn't say Christ Christos and only one he just said you now I'm baptizing you and you're going to believe on him that is to come he didn't even know what his name was yet so they just all got baptized with no name oh my and when they heard this they were baptized in the name of father son Holy Ghost In The Name Of The Lord Jesus and Rebecca said okay so they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul had laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesy which is to foretell future events or reveals the secrets of people's hearts in the assembly praise the Lord so when they receive the Holy Ghost then look what happened to them so the Holy Ghost came on them and they spake with tongues how many of you people here tonight still believe the Holy Ghost can do the same thing but speaking in tongues is not the evidence of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord some may speak in tongues and they may not some may shout and they may not but there's one thing about it they'll all be changed and you will amen the word of God now let's read in Ephesians 1:3 in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation notice again separating the gospel message from the baptism of the Holy Ghost these lying preachers down Through the Ages that have told people it's one and the same are going to answer at the day of judgment and they're going to look in the Angry Eyes of almighty God let me bring it on down because we got message preachers is saying the same thing that you can't believe the message of the hour without the Holy Ghost so if you believe God sent a prophet you've got the Holy Ghost that's as big a lie as a Baptist well come on if you really get the true Holy Ghost in This Day on your soul you will believe the message of the hour but I think we've all been around long enough to know we've had all kinds Among Us this said they believe the message of the hour but it's sure evident they didn't have the Holy Ghost in whom y'all so trusted after that you heard the word of Truth so after you heard the word of Truth which is the gospel then you trusted on Jesus as your savior the gospel of your salvation in whom also after after that ye believe ye you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise not when you believed oh thank you Lord oh my look friends I preached it for years and years I believe one of the greatest laes Among Us in our own ranks is the true baptism of the Holy Ghost ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise I ain't just talking about Leon either it's evident a bunch of preachers and our ranks ain't had it either it's evident preachers that have studied and preached the message a lot of them ain't had the Holy Ghost that's why they go after this move and that move and that move some of them after they preach for 20 and 30 years and then deny the message and the messenger how in the world could you have the Holy Ghost which is the earnest of our inheritance salvation is not your earnest accepting Jesus as your savior is not your earnest I'm asking you tonight who are you are you just saved are you just people that I believe I believe God sent his son I believe who's your father who's your mother is your soul born from on high are you born are you bir from the beginning can you TR your origination back to the original Lamb's Book of Life hallelu Hallelujah listen Rebecca this is going to determine if you're the real bride or not with the token in the last days comes an assurance that you've got it not guessing not hoping a no so amen hallelujah I wonder what it have said if she said well they told me my daddy was so and so and my mother was so and so and my uncle and my grandpa but to be honest with you I don't know you know I've heard this old saying before there's a difference in thinking and knowing and I'm thinking she's my mother but she really knows uh my my my my my my my my my my my Daddy thinks uh my Daddy thinks that I'm his girl but my mama knows if I am or not well I think I've got the holy ghost man after these special meeting Oh Glory to God I'll tell you one thing I think I've got the Holy Ghost but now we're back just to Wednesday night to you old slow down old Pastor have you still got just as much joy today as you had on Friday and Saturday and Sunday are you just as much saved just as much revelated are you just as much determined tonight as you were in the special meetings and the nice beautiful banquet and all that I'm more determined now than I was over the weekend aren't you cuz I know where I come from I heard my father speaking to me this last few days didn't you and it only reestablished more of what I believed about myself so somebody please ask me who I am which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory listen this John 1:1 he came unto his own and his own received him not but to as many as received him to them gave he power to become I know I've shared the meaning of this word with you before but it's such a good and I'm going to keep on saying it till the Millennium I reckon he gave them power to become look at the meaning of it come to pass be fulfilled be preferred don't you understand every son and daughter of God is a prophecy it's no wonder that we identify brother Daryl with a prophetic message I myself am a prophetic word from God you if you're a member of the bride of Christ you are a prophetic word from God and the Lord Jesus only come to the Earth so you could come to pass so he come he came to his own and his own receiv received him not but to as many as received him to them gave he the power to become or come to pass he gave you the power to come to pass thank you Lord Jesus the sons of God even to them that believe on his name do you understand what we're doing we're coming to pass we are a prophetic utterance from God we started as a thought in his mind and he spoke us before the foundation of the worlden this is our our time frame this is our hour notice which we born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God I know that boy the Free Will Baptist have a hard time with that scripture oh my they think they're counterbalancing John Calvin because John Calvin broke into some of this stuff and he said good Lord have mercy then I wouldn't say because I wanted to be I wouldn't say because my mama wanted me to be I would say because God wanted me to be I quoted it to you here I guess it was Sunday after the service that Martin Luther said when I look at myself I don't see how I could be saved but when I look at Jesus I don't see how I could be lost well I hope that's the way you're looking at yourself tonight if a man just under the influence of justification would see that what about us with a token in the last day which were born not of blood nor the will of fresh glory to God I'll tell you one thing I heard that preacher preach that sermon I grabbed the hold of the horns of the altar I wouldn't let go I'm telling you I went down there I beat and banged on that altar I prayed her through brother I made up my mind I done this I done that you done nothing the biggest problem in our life as us thinking what we've done anyhow you're not born by your own will you're not born by your own choice you're born by the will of God who are you who are we are we people that's born by our determination is that what keeps us I am born by the Breath of God couldn't have made it this far on my own I don't have the strength to do it he's proven that time and time again and I'm going to say it for a bunch of the rest of you you couldn't either you ain't here tonight because you're so stable and you're so great you're a bunch of puny weaklings all of us are if it wasn't for the grace of God we' have fell flat on our face and would have never got up again but the grace of God grabs a hold of us and we fall flat on our face and he reachs down and jerks us up again Hallelujah it don't mean because you belong to him you won't fall flat on your face you will but he'll grab a hold of you and say come on boy come on daughter of God get up dust yourself off your mind [Applause] amen who are you James 1:18 of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures that's who I am not by my will not by my determination not by your strength strength but by his own will he called you Romans 8:8 so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God how many Still In the Flesh oh dear God there must be some people in here that ain't they didn't raise their hands wow I mean I I I I I'm tot surprised I never thought theopen would have ugly faces the way some of y'all didn't raise your hands as God some of y'all got gray head and you got glasses on you got contacts on oh man I need to go back and reread it don't I how many sell In the Flesh ah so some of you ain't your theophanies after all well because you are that's definite proof you cannot please God by the will of your flesh that is so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit good Lord so you mean if I'm born again I'm Not In the Flesh that's a yes and no question well which one is it brother Donnie it's actually both because the new birth wants to dominate the flesh control selfishness temper anger malice Strife but you're not in the flesh but in the spirit now notice capital S not the human Spirit if so be the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his so the Lord Jesus does not yet claim you as his until you're filled with the Holy Ghost you're a work in progress for sure and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit amen of him that raised up Jesus from the dead boy this is one of my favorite scriptures in Pentecost and this is one I use to back up shouting it will Quicken your mortal body so that's what I preach glory to God if you got the Holy Ghost the spirit of God in you will Quicken your mortal body here we' take off a running and a shouting and some of them would go to running and a shouting and the cigarettes would fall out of their pockets and the picture of their brother's wife that they was packing around that fall out of their pockets and all kinds of things that fall out of their pocket but glory to God our body was being quickened I'm not against that but that ain't even what Paul's talking about it will actually Quicken our bodies to complete obedience to the word now watch this new man/ old man Romans 66 knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that hence Force we should not serve sin which we did do of course before we were born again Ephesians 4:21 if so be that ye have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus that you put off concerning the former conversation now watch how he identifies your talk and he calls your talk and manner of Life the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust well I'm just an sinner saved by grace I sin a little bit more or less every day and not of it's so perfect and uh you know that's what the blood is for the blood is there because we can never bring this flesh subject to the spirit of God and we just kind of struggle along is that who you are do you understand that's the testimony of the majority of Christians on the face of the Earth well this just runs in my family it runs in my family to not be able to forgive people and to hold grudges it runs in my family it's just hard for me to say I'm wrong you need to be a part of Jesus family cause the Cry of this hour is repent and if you can't repent it means you ain't got the Holy Ghost yet amen woo got a lot of Rebeccas by name we're thinning them down by Nature though ain't we now come on the former conversation the old man which is uh corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit the Numa the Numa the spirit of your mind FAL that which gives you the ability to think like he thinks so let this mind for Neil being in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not Roby to be equal with God but was in made in like fashion as we are and took upon himself so he didn't think of himself as being some great something some great this or that or the other and let us have this same mind that we're not this great this and that we're just a speck that's all we are that you put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness Colossians 3:9 lie not one to another seeing that you have put off the old man with his deed and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him oh my goodness who are you who are you so are you still the old man or are you a new one which has been created after the image of him that created him him who the new man the new man is in the image of the Creator this is in the image of mother and father and Grandma and Grandpa and aunt and uncle praise God 2 Corinthians 5:17 therefore If any man be in Christ he is a all things are passed away behold three or three to five things or maybe six even let's stretch it on out to seven seven things will become new what I wonder sometimes friends if we don't need need to have some good oldfashioned Bible studies not just for the young people either all things are become new Galatians 6:15 for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision Avil us anything nor uncircumcision but a new creature who are you where did you come from who is your father what is your lineage are you identified as a Baptist a Methodist a Church of God let me bring it on down or just a message follower or are you identified as a new man a new woman a new person a new creature old things are passed away and all things are new who are you Jesus is the firstborn can I have a few more minutes before we close Romans 8 29 for whom he did for no brother Donnie here you go you started this back in 1987 and 88 when you first come here and you caused a vision among the church in Happy Valley it needed to cause division you started preaching that old predestination seed stuff and Lord have mercy it tore people all to pieces well I'm kind of glad cuz some of them that got all tore up really got turned around and got set on the straight path well Hallelujah I was kind of ignorant because I hadn't been to the message that long and I thought everybody believe what the prophet taught and what Paul taught about predestination but Happy Valley was one of my first run-ins with a lot of people that didn't believe in predestination so I had my to myself an absolute gastronomical Jubilee of pulling up all these quotes and putting them together my goodness and preaching it over at the other church and me and a few more had a Revival other had a battlefield but the rest of us had a Revival and I'll tell you it still brings Revival to my soul this day you know why this is who I am I'm not base while I Choice I'm a Free Will Baptist I ain't no Free Will Baptist I ain't no free will Pentecostal I'm a gene seed of God I was ordained before the foundation of the world he made his choice before I ever had the Breath of Life to make my choice he chose me I didn't choose him he give me the grace of God oh Hallelujah to choose him if I make it it'll be him if you make it it'll be him if there is a Rapture it will be him for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren so Jesus is the oldest son of the family as a matter of fact he is the choir leader I'm going to let you ponder over it a little bit the first born of many Brethren not him and all the rest of these slaves down there and he snaps his fingers and they're terrified oh sir that's not who you are you may still be an Egypt in your mind but you need to come to the land of promise in mind and in Soul I was a slave but no more I told you he the other night one thing that changed me when I come to the message of the hour it done away with that Pentecost also fear that I had that I was terrified of God I was scared to death of God but when I heard this Prophet talk to God and the way he talked to it and the mercy that he presented it totally transformed me and Chang the way I talk to Papa god well the truth of it was I got a word birth of Malachi 4 wo I got saved back in Pentecost I got a baptism of the Holy Ghost my spirit and Pentecost I got gifts and Pentecost I spoke in tongues I prophesied I preached but I couldn't have a word verse of Malachi 4 until I come under the influence of Malachi 4 that he might be the first born among many Brethren Hebrews 210 for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation I want you to notice Paul does not give him the rank of General look at the condensation of his love the captain he had to condens sin and step down from being General commander of the battalions of angels and took on the rank of Captain and them would even condens lower to that and become a snake on the pole the make the captain of their who Brothers Lord God do you understand why he took on Humanity do you understand what made him do it I'll tell you in a minute for it became him for whom are all all things and by whom are all things and bringing many sons into glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings is there anybody in Word of Life Church that is willing to join the army of the Lord and in this Army you may suffer tremendous things some he will appoint to sickness as he tells us in the church age book it is his prerogative to even appoint some to death will we say yes sir and we'll salute his command are we part of the army of the sufferings of Christ we don't want to be a bunch of babies do we oh my notice this in verse 11 for both he that sanctifieth and they who are Sanctified so high priest and redeemed Brothers he who sanctify us and they who are Sanctified are all of One amen here you go Rebecca here's who you are Jesus is not of one kind and you another he's not of one species and you another but you're of the same chinos for which cause he is not ashamed to call them Brethren Brethren anybody here got family that you'd be kind of shamed for anybody else to know they're your family only just me and Harry well that's surprising okay brother Pete I see he's got uh anybody else here was you kind of raising your hand brother Tony you're just kind of scratching your head there but can you imagine us being what we were and causing him all this pain and Agony all of my life I've caused him but he don't look at me and say Donnie I'm ashamed for anybody to even know you're my brother I'm not ashamed of you T I'm not ashamed of you Manuel you're not servant your slave oh yes that's the heart that we have that's the heart we have but by recognition of our position he wants to stand right up there right by him in the choir and he's going to lead us in the family anthem for which cause he is not ashamed to call their brethren Christ and these Sons stand in the same Plateau saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee so Jesus sings and he tells the rest of the family all right family help me sing it now and Jesus being the first born in the choir says children let's sing songs of redemption and mercy rewrote my life and Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound and he looked beyond my fault and on and on and on and Jesus starts us off with that great chorus and we worship and then the rest of the family joins in uh shall forever lift my eyes to calary who are you who are you oh I'm nothing Brother Don I'm good for nothing I'll never be nothing I'm you need to quit believing them lies your daddy may have told you that your mama may have told you that but your brother is telling you look up this way stand and again I will put my trust in him and again behold I of the children which God has given me notice the Lord Jesus hey it's astounding here Paul is quoting the Lord Jesus and again I will put my trust in him the Lord Jesus in morphe word saying I will put my trust in him how you I done that brother Daryl go into the garden of Geth father if it be thy will let this let this cup pass from me and the father didn't answer that prayer he said no so what did Jesus the man the human body the human nature have to do same thing you and I have to do when Jesus says no to our prayer sometimes then what do we do brother Steve when we don't understand then we trust him we trust him yesterday on my phone come up a picture you I does on your phones and that was me in the middle and my arm was around one of my little buddies brother Tim and my other arm is around another one of my little buddies I say little cuz they're shorter than me brother Ron and I took a picture and sent it to both of them yesterday and then it just took my finger and I slid it across the top and the next picture was my precious little girl that smile left my face and it started weeping I didn't feel happy no more and I looked at that picture and I said Lord God you see how much we love her how much we miss her but this is what I told him but I trust you you are perfect you don't make mistakes it runs in his family among his brothers and his sisters what they don't understand others will turn and walk away but it's a family trade in our family to say as our elder brother said I trust you even when I don't understand cuz he knows how much broken is enough you and I look at oursel and we say Lord don't hurt me don't hurt me now just just just you know maybe don't don't break me all together just maybe scratch me a little you know maybe just kind of handle me a little bit rough don't break me Lord don't don't break me I heard it years ago when I first started listening to tapes and brother B said father you've broken my heart over and over again and I thank you for it I wow I'm starting to understand more about it aren't you oh I will put my trust in him and again I and the children which God has given me listen this this is why I became flesh for as much as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise took part of the same the word translated took part is not the same as partakers but it implies partaking of something outside of oneself so he partook took part of something that was outside of himself for me it was normal to be a human normal to hurt normal for anxiety I was born this way but he wasn't born the word that way so he had to take part of something which was outside of himself do you understand he didn't do this children for the foolish virgin don't make the Bible lie this was not done for fallen angels according to Paul the whole work of incarnation was for the family's sake amen but remember if you go into a pawn shop and you've got a buggy you've got a whole pocket full of receipts item 22 item 37 item 45 it's in B three item 89 and B five and you've got them receipts right there and you're there to claim and then you walk by something else and you say whosoever will let him come and a pyol jumps in your buggy and a drill jumps in your buggy and a curling Aron jumps in your buggy and you go up to the cash reg and you say I'll take them all but the reason you came was for those names you had on those receipts but to as many as received him gave he power to come to pass the others don't even have eternal life yet you do you've come to pass you've come this far the others will be granted life because they don't want to be lost they don't want to perish so he says okay whosoever will let them come come on y'all want to come you don't want to go to hell well come on come on I'll save you but he says to the brothers Brothers I've got a family choir even the angels can't sing in it y'all ready come on brothers sisters Lord God for as much as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood you mean to tell me they were already children if you believe your Bible that's what your Bible says for as much as the children are partakers of flesh and blood so they did not become children after they were in flesh and blood they were children before they partook of Flesh and Blood that's what your Bible says who are you that's so you are children before you was ever this SP it it was the will of God that salvation should be bought by the son for sons the will of God that salvation should be bought by the son for Sons even as some of the Egyptians came out of Egypt with Israel the handmaids that protected their children and the Bible says God built for them a house in other words gave them a posterity they never become Jews and they was never a part of the tribes but God gave them an inheritance so is it with the whosoever Will Group thank God for it we offer salvation yes praise God we're not trying to stand in nobody's way come one come on but listen friends only the children will ever be able to grasp this only children anybody here tonight beside me say Lord I want to see more clearly who I am I want to see it father as we have our hands raised up before you Lord oh Jesus thank you for this word tonight Lord as I've sat studying Lord God in the last week or so preparing this it's been burning in my heart oh Lord help us may we be able to answer who we are praise God may we be able to answer as the prophet said I am not the son of Charles and El Bram what was it he said it was another person a spot of eternal life down inside of me crying out hallelujah oh Jesus I pray that I'm speaking to a building full tonight of the same way Lord not only just the people that CH but those are streaming tonight Lord some of them maybe tonight May may be the first time that they've heard the angel and I ain't talking about me neither I'm talking about the angel of the Lord that's going around the world and calling the bride giving her the ability to hear it's evident people can listen to tapes and do it feverishly and not hear tapes because they listen to tapes and make fun of preachers which the tapes say preachers should preach so it's evident just because you hear them don't mean you hear them so we don't want to just play them we don't want to just listen to them we want to hear what the spirit says to the church oh granted Lord we worship you tonight Jesus praise God and he loves him tonight with all your heart oh my praise the Lord God bless you Saints look this way if you would verse 17 wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his Brethren again the sons of God are already his brothers before we were ever born again brother Danny quoted it here this weekend who did the Spirit Fall upon at Pentecost Sons who's the spirit of God falling on today Sons and Daughters of God wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his Brethren that he might be a merci ful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people praise God praise God oh we worship you tonight Lord who are you are you just a a Weber are you just a Smith a Hughes a ward a Davis a Reagan no I am more than that I am a Son of God Sons and Daughters of God are in this place tonight praise the Lord and he came to be made like you so he could turn right around and make you I can oh praise the Lord praise the Lord oh we worship you Lord Jesus we worship you Lord Jesus can we just close our eyes just for a few minutes here and just and just worship him now I I know you got work and you got school and all that tomorrow I won't hold you too long but oh my we've been invited to sit at his table this is sort of like just a little family meal you know whenever we sat at our family and we sat around the table as me and Carol did before church this evening and she had sweet potatoes and and smoked pork chops and cornbread and and that nice country supper that we had I only had one fork I didn't have two or three like I had at the banquet only had one knife and they wasn't gold colored and I didn't have no faints and napkin I told the brothers I said I'm not even sure which one of these knives I'm supposed to use or which Fork but I knew which one to use tonight Carol made it simple she put one on the table well we're just kind of home folk here tonight and we're pulled up to the table so just get you one fork and your one spoon and your knife let's just cut on this lamb that's been prepared for us tonight and let's just eat and eat and eat until we eat ourselves into a body change Hallelujah I want to be more like you Lord I want to be more like you help me Lord Jesus that I can die more and more every day that I can be more more like you help these sheep father men women boys girls oh Father God that we can die that the spirit of God within our soul can become the preeminent Master the leader oh this flesh will battle us until we die or or it's changed and that's the ultimate victory Of course that we're reaching for but what you want us to do is have a victory every day leading up to the ultimate one that the first reaction when Trouble Comes is not our flesh with fear and anger and frustration but within the soul by Nature it's our natural reaction for the flesh to react first but you're trying to change us from that to where our first reaction will not be the natural man but the spirit man so instead of fearing it'll be Faith instead of anger it'll be calm instead of frustration and raise s our voice and it'll be a soft answer turn us away wrath oh Jesus We Worship You Lord God we bless you we're part of the family choir here tonight to sing a love song to our Jesus hallelujah we're not here tonight to sing that we are slaves and we are people that have no freedom and the economy of God that's not our song but our song is we have been redeemed we have been set free so father every person here tonight that's under the bondage of fear they're not living where you want them to be Lord I realize there's such a delicate balance that we can be so hungering and thirsting after you and Satan will turn that against us and Rob us of the joy of where we currently are help us to realize we will never have that complete satisfaction until we're in that new body but what I want is the ultimate satisfaction of what I can have here whatever that is help me to find that Lord oh granted Jesus I want to be everything that I can be right now and know that the greater portion will come after while but I'm not going to live sad and beat down and lonely here waiting for that great day to come tomorrow I want to live in Victory as high as I can live right now in this present world I want healing I want Deliverance I want peace I want joy I want peace of mind Hallelujah I want to be able to praise God I want to be able to Worship You Lord I want everything that is my inheritance right now with even

God hallelujah hallelujah sing that for us I'm free thank you Lord Jesus I'm free from those sins I'm free not just from sins but from tradition that had me bound e even after I become a Christian aren't you glad God is setting us free more free service after service that we can realize who we are praise the Lord I heard the Prophet this week talking about sister shakaron and he said she had just passed that week some of the different Brothers was prophesying that she was going to live the Lord had showed brother brandom a vision years before that he saw her and she was running reaching out to him for help but he couldn't get to her and he saw the hands on the clock and he couldn't make out exactly the time but he said the voice said say between 2 and 3:00 in the morning so he saw her in the vision and she was running running trying to get to him but she couldn't couldn't reach him in time so sister shakaryan passed brother bradam is going to preach our power of transformation and he said we want to pray of course for brother Deus and and all of them that what they're going through and he said I know how to relate I lost my brother my father my wife my mother or my baby rather he said in just a few days apart and then he said these words you don't know how to relate to people unless you've gone through it yourself can y'all say that's the truth as as a as a mortal but can you imagine the Lord God saying that too I'm God and I know everything but I can't relate to them by my omnisense I can't relate to them by my omnipotence the only way I can really relate to them is become one of them so I've got to be tempted by them I've got to be hated like they'll be hated I've got to be rejected I've got to fill with anxiety and I've got to feel like like they feel
