crucified Worthy is foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] I have to say it's hard for me to comprehend that one day angels will bow their holy heads if you can imagine it when the redeemed are gathered there and we are changed by the power of God the prophet said that the angels will circle the Earth was about his as we are singing and worshiping and blessing our God wow those of us which were lost and seemingly without a hope and yet angels will have to hold their peace while we sing that's wonderful in it let's turn tonight to First Corinthians if you would chapter 12 verse 17. I mean it's happened to be in the house of the Lord amen it's wonderful for us to be gathered together First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 17. let's look tonight by the hope of the Lord on a parallel of Israel in the Old Testament and the Church of course in the New Testament and will pick up this where Paul is speaking about the body if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the whole were hearing where where the smelling but now haths God set the members every one of them in the body now listen how he does it and he asks you all if you're okay with it and then if you all agree with him then he as it has pleased yeah him so you mean it doesn't even ask us it's if it's if it's okay I guarantee you what I'd answered him and he'd said I want you to preach you okay but I said no sir I'm not I have a problem with that that's what I told him whenever he called me I said no I I don't want to preach I can't preach no no I made all kinds of excuses Moses did Brother Ram did every God called Manuel that's right but God didn't even ask me he didn't ask me if it's okay then he calls me into the ministry and then he don't ask me which one I want saying that and what kind of God is this An Almighty one so he tells you what to do and the strange thing about it is he makes you like it and you think well really in all reality I wouldn't want to do anything else but please him and you think that I just say that that'd come out of my mouth that I honestly say I want to do what I don't want to do but I want to do what he wants me to do even though I don't want to do that even though I don't want to do it at all you say but Rudy would you want to be anything else no I would and you wouldn't eat if you're called of God so it sets it in the body as it has pleased him I mean let to be remembered tonight as we pray Erica went to her cancer doctor the other day and he told her about an immunotherapy drug that they wanted her to try immunotherapy Works different than the other things that she's done the immunotherapy there's like 105 or so right now they're constantly making them but they work with your immune system and they beef up the T cells and it just depends on what type of cancer of course you have and things but Erica's Insurance last week turned her down I don't know why because this treatment wasn't but forty thousand a month but somehow somebody must have got a prayer through him because this week she got approved [Applause] so now instead of the Parker family paying 40 000. they will pay for dollars a month so everybody what's your view of it well my view of it is this almighty God is her healer if he wants to use a little dab of chemo and a little dab of immunotherapy and a whole lot of prayer and a whole lot of this and that and other I really don't care how he does it I just want her heels yeah yeah so I guess it was supposed to come in today and she'll she'll begin that so you'll remember her in prayer I'm just waiting every day myself for the angel of the Lord to pass through our house and make her well we're not just believing God that these cancer cells are going to die in the liver and in the brain and wherever else that they might be I'm asking God for this that he'll restore every side effect the chemo is caused every side effect that's still there because of the other things hey look you know the prophet said ask God for big things and many of them so why should we ask just for healing and kind of resume from that why not ask for a complete restoration amen where the doctors say it's all in her liver but I'll tell you one thing my daddy is the first one to ever make a liver he can make another one so whatever you need tonight ask God for great things and many of them or you like the little fish in the ocean that would say I better drink of this water sparingly what if the Pacific runs out what if the Atlantic runs out or a little mouse in the Garners of Egypt and there's millions of grains in that Garner and he says I better allot myself to maybe one grain per day because what if this famine goes on for maybe 12 or 14 years God gave you a checkbook and the Dow preached it to us several years ago and the deposits already made in your name in your account he knew everything he'd ever need from the day you got saved to the day you die of the day of your raptured and he's covered everything you'll ever need from that point are you afraid to cash the check let's believe him tonight shall we I mean I'd like to be remembered as we pray God bless you Heavenly Father we counted such an honor that we could be gathered together here tonight Lord in your great presence we thank you Father that we're not only here in the visible audience of many many hundreds of your children but Lord God there's a greater number than that there's a great host of your angels we believe that they are here with us father they encamped about us Lord God we just asked tonight that you would take this service and speak to us from your word we said a lot Lord but we we're a needy people we know that but our God has all of our needs covered amen Lord Jesus we bring all the petitions before you tonight we agree together for the sick for the wounded The Afflicted Lord those that are sad oppressed whatever their need is tonight would you speak to him Lord your word may your presence come and arrest us as it were Hallelujah may your love conquer us and then may the banner be stretched over us with your name written all over it father speak to us tonight father in the name of Jesus Christ we pray for his sake and for his glory the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated turn with me to numbers chapter 1 verse 52. and the children of Israel shall pitch their tents every man by his own camp and every man by his own standard throughout their host so the children of Israel shall pitch their tents every man by his own Camp notice the divisions so there's camps and there are different standards and every man by his own standard throughout their host notice verse 53. but the Levites shall pitch round about the Tabernacle of testimony now listen why that there be no wraths upon the congregation of the children of Israel and the Levites shall keep the charge of the Tabernacle of the testimony so they're going to be to the east the West the North and the South but the Levites are in a different position the Levites are going to be all around the Tabernacle for what reason so none of the children of Israel will die so you mean the Levites are standing there as part of God's mercy so that the Shekinah Glory will not kill any of the tribes now why would that be so essential and so necessary you see so that no man not being a levite would approach this sacred holy place so someone from the tribe of Reuben which was the firstborn from the tribe of GAD nephtali issachar on down on down on down they could not come directly themselves and if anyone tried to approach that spot the Levites would have stopped them so the Levites were God's bumper of Grace that would separate the people of God from his presence of them entering in to Divine judgment now you know God has always had a Ministry he himself was the first one that ministered to his children in the Garden of Eden and now we can see the anatype of the New Testament Church that even though every believer in the New Testament will have direct access to the throne of God they don't have to have a priest of course to pray for them but they will have a Ministry which will stand there in the presence of God and bring and constant reminder to the rest of the body the flock the thoughts of God and the Divine protocol of God on how to approach him so you know it makes me feel really sad and heavy for those who feel like they really don't need a minister they really don't need a preacher well first of all they don't believe the setting of the Old Testament or the setting of the new now God himself is the one that sets a certain order now I realize a lot of people they identify order as organization but God doesn't you see God has always had order and he always will but what man does man tries to take an organizational system and replace the divine order of God and if we're not careful we are independence of course and we don't want any organization we don't want no system over us at all but being Independence if we're not careful it will tend to make us to where we defy any order whatsoever so we then think that we are outside of the Divine protocol of God or the order of god notice in Numbers chapter 2 verse 17 then the Tabernacle of the congregation Shall Set forward with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camp as they encamp so shall they set forward now notice how they're to set the rest of the tribes are setting somewhat different but the Levites every one of them no matter which side they are on they all have one common goal and that is they are setting forward toward the midst of the camp now notice how Moses writes this so they shall set forward so none of them were allowed to Camp backwards none of them were allowed to Camp sideways none of them could take their tent and turn it away from the Tabernacle of testimony they were forbidden the only way the Levites could camp was forward so God never leads any god-called man to ever Lead You backwards every God called man will always lead the people of God in a forward Direction so for those who have hung around the message for years and years and desire to take the people back in whatever direction that might be now some of course want to go back to 1906 Pentecost well I've been there and done that you ain't taking me back there I want to go back to Pentecost but the Acts 2 1 not the 1906 one come on somebody well then there's others that don't want to go back to Pentecost but they revert back to Baptist or they revert back to Church of Christ or whatever they were and then they'd take the message Theology and then their church has become As Dead As a hammer they don't even believe in the move of the spirit of God anymore but no God call man is ever going to take you backwards in the sense to an organizational system because his tent always pitches forward now what was the representation of the Tabernacle sitting in the middle now notice sin as every man is in his place by their standards now remember this is a god of order so they couldn't just say oh you know what I'd like to be over there or let's just say it what people say today I I I feel led I feel led to go over there and actually I I'm of the tribe of Reuben will say and and remember the friend we're really good buddies and brother Fred no doubt he would have been to the tribe of Judah because he's a praise God he loves to praise loves to Worship the Lord and and brother Fred would have no doubt been in the tribe of Judah and I'd say you know what I I really like hanging around brother Fred and I like some of these other praise folks so I I think that I feel led myself to go over there and kind of camp out with Judah because after all ain't we all go into the same place and then we all worshiping the same God but I was forbidden by God himself to do that because I was committed to camp in a certain Camp under a certain standard well praise the Lord so I could not just say well I feel led to go over there this week and then I feel led to be over there next week and I feel led to be over there the next week and as a matter of fact if you run that through the New Testament you'll never even find them words well I feel led to do this and I feel led to do that and I feel led to do that but you see one reason people like that so much is because the way they look at it that trumps the word no matter what the word says if they feel led to do this or that or the other then you know what that's higher than the word that shows you a non-holy ghost-filled person anybody that's got the Holy Ghost will never put any feeling above God's word they will judge whatever they feel led to do by God's word and if God's word says something different than what they feel led to do they'll say that was the devil because God's word is always right is anybody going to say Amen with me tonight now you see they did not have a choice of where they could be now no doubt some of them that were reubenites and they might have been nurtured more like gadites or maybe some of the gadites would have been natured humanly I'm talking about like the issacharites and that said well you know what I actually like them better I like that camp over there better God never gave them a choice God said if you are of God you go there God then say is that okay with everybody but God said that's where you go and you can't in your family now they could not do as they wish to do they could not do what they wanted to do but they had to go where God told them to go anybody preaching with me tonight so it was not a camp in a random manner that they would share and then they was over there and you say well where's brother so and so oh well he felt led to uh to move well he felt led to go over here to this other camp and uh well now wait a minute wait a minute he was part of this Camp right here and this was his post of Duty and and his seats are not being filled there because him and his wife and son and daughter was there oh yeah but but he decided he wanted to go over here or go over there that's not the way it worked uh let me just give you an update that's not the way it works in the Holy Ghost Field Church in the New Testament either now watch this is God's own choice remember this place is God's place of worship so God is a god of order and a god of efficiency and a god of divine protocol that hates confusion God is not the author of confusion whether it's in a church or in a family or whatever it is or a move of God God is not the author of confusion the devil does that so God wanted them to be arranged in a camp manifest so they would have known exactly where each person was so in the tribe of God was set up and God himself was the one that even told them because remember there's going to be four directions and God himself was the one that told them which ones to go East which wants to go west north and south they did not randomly draw it it was not a lottery they did not vote he was not even asking them which side do you want God told them himself and Moses being the mouse piece of God was the one that God used and gave this manifest fast now to the people so the various tribes of Israel had to be placed in order and the whole had to be put under a strict regulation this was needful for encampment for the March and for worship now remember people get in their mind that order will that they think that's bondage you know oh my anything we've got to do I hear some of the message preachers make their remarks every now and then and I don't mind to tell you it rubs this preacher the wrong way that they will make their remarks about church order and I've heard some of the message preachers kind of you know saying that in a slanderous way in a way of a reproachful way but I would like to remind those preachers the same Prophet that you quote about Acts 2 and the same Prophet that you quote about Pentecost and the same Prophet that you quote about Miracle signs and wonders it's the same Prophet that use the words Church order unless of course we're going to start running a cafeteria and we're going to make the message like a cafeteria and we go through and pick out which quotes we want and which ones we don't want Church order if it's drawn exactly the way God's Prophet said it was set up because whether or not you all believe it he was found exactly the direction from Saint Paul and if it's run exactly that way Church order is not sent to take out gifts it's not to sin to take out the manifestation of the Holy Ghost but I'll tell you what it's sent for it's to keep people who are in the flesh operating so-called gifts that are not even prophesying in the first place and they give wrong tongues and they give wrong interpretation well come on somebody it's sent to weed them out so we can have real genuine ones instead of ones that ain't even real now you believe whatever you want to believe I do not believe my God hints and misses I do not believe that if a person is speaking in tongues and interpreting or prophecy whichever way that it is I do not believe it will hit three out of five I do not believe it will hit four out of five if it's God it will hit five out of five I do not believe a man with real genuine discernment is going to hit two out of five three out of seven four out of eight I believe a real gift of God from the presence of God God does not lie and remember when brother random set his own church in order it was for that reason and some of the people left of course and went to Junior Jackson's church because he didn't believe in church order and so brother Branham you know deals with the question answers on the seals question answer 64 again and he tells them that a lot of the people were speaking in tongues and saying things that never did happen it was not even Prophecy in the first place yeah the Lord say I'm coming soon that ain't prophecy well come on don't get quiet on me he said God does not repeat repetitious things and God does not repeat those but you know scripture yeah the Lord say I'm coming soon that is not prophecy and yet some of our message people are going right back in the same way Allah friends I'm going to preach West or without you it's up to you I'm trying my best to hold a standard up before you all do you want a standard with my picture on it is this what we're wanting at our church I'll tell you some of the standards that are being raised in the message it's got the pictures of the message people's favorite preacher and if you look around you'll see all kinds of standards that are being raised in the message now a standard is an Ensign or a flag and it's something that people rally around it was the custom of the Romans that they would have a standard which was the Roman Standard and then they would also have a standard of their leading general Vespasian or whoever born it was so they would have a mixture of several standards when they would go out to battle so they would have the Roman Standard and then if this particular platoon was from a centurion was there he might have a standard and there would be a general that would have his standards I'll tell you one thing if you're very spiritual tonight and you'll think back to every man-made move that has been in this message and you look at the standard that was raised when they raised it up you know what you'll find on that standard it will not be the Tabernacle of testimony it will not be the Tabernacle of the congregation but it will be the image of some preacher you look at every one of these moves that have been in our ranks and look and see if a preacher is not the main one that started boy some of y'all require a bunch of Baptists tonight and you look at every one of them and look how they started and look how they end and if it is a man-made move it will come to naught Amen brother Dottie well I can preach an amen to if I need to it's just taking me doubly long I better preach two hours and a half in order to get an Irish sermon or you all can say man and all to work an hour and ten but you see myself I'm not interested in having a standard hanging over our church with my picture on it or some other man's picture on it I'll tell you who I want to be on our standard the Lord Jesus himself well come on Amen now you see God is this God of order so the children of Israel would be gathered under this order so that would be now listen so you understand it each tribe would have its own standard but when it come to them setting around the Tabernacle and when it come to them marching and when it come to them worshiping they were divided into four major groups so now there's 12 birthstones and there's 12 standards each child has a birthstone each tribe has a standard but when they set up around the Tabernacle which is their position in Christ as we look at it in the New Testament there was four major subgroups and that was they would sit down there was four major standards and there would be three tribes or four gathered under each one of those yep they would have their own tribal standard and then they would have many of them a family stay standard so they would have all of these different standards what was it for in case you got turned around you could be able to look around and see where you belonged so you look and say okay my goodness now you imagine when they set this up it is estimated that there was 2.2 million people that were here when this is written in the book of numbers so 2.2 million people this Camp was Miles spread out this way and this way and this way and this way we're talking about an encampment so large it would have been a good sized city so if you would have got turned around you know imagine these tense a lot of them look similar so you get out you're going over here to visit somebody from the Reuben you're going over there to naftala to visit somebody over there and you're coming back around and you're saying oh my goodness what in the world where am I where am I well you know if you would be able to be trained and taught thought you'd be able to look up and you'd see hanging up on a pole that would be your banner your tribal standard well now once you get there there's three if not four tribes in that direction where you are you still don't know exactly where you're going so what you do once you get into the subgroup you identify yourself okay I'm in the right camp at least I'm in the right Camp I'm in the camp of Judah but I live in a certain place in the camp of Judah so I just can't come in the camp of Judah anywhere but I've got a certain camp and I've got another trouble because action I'm not of the tribe of Judah but that's the subtribe that I belong to so then you go to looking around and you're looking and you're looking and you're looking for your own tribe oh okay there it is over there it is I found it now I found it so now you get over there now you're in more the direction of where you should be but you still belong to a certain family inside that certain tribe inside that certain Camp inside this certain encampment can't you see why Satan hates order and this is why people don't know who they are they don't know where they're supposed to go to church they don't know who the pastor is come on somebody they don't know if they belong in the seven Thunders they don't know if God's got seven Hunters they are not even sure they're not sure if they're supposed to be in the two soul group they're not shifting she just plate tapes only and stay home they don't know where to go let me tell you some friend there's a lot of mixed up people inside the ranks of this message and it's so sad so you find some then that are raising new flags and new standards and they say well we're a message search over here but we're really not going to preach the message what we're going to do is we're going to kind of hold it to ourself so that we can kind of build up our church you know and we're going to build up our church but we're not going to preach on earrings and makeup and dress and we're certainly not going to mention brother Ram's name because if we do that would run people off so we're just flying up a new standard and it's kind of got this man's picture on it and that man's picture you know this and that and the other and understand they're trying to figure what in the world is all that I don't understand it at all and you're trying to identify what it is well but each one of us in reality every person here is identified by a standard every one of you men women boys girls you all are identified by a certain standard I hope it's the right one now the Lord Jesus has got a standard by which he will fly over his bride it will be those under that Banner that go in the Rapture you see he's not looking for the seventh under Banner because that is a man-made system he's not looking for the two Soul Banner he's not looking for the purusia banner because again that's a man-made system but what he's looking for is the banner that he himself stretched over his elect and they will be gathered from the four corners of the Earth in a moment in a twinkling of an eye praise the Lord now from all of these camps of course there will be elect that will be called out of all that so they were under this strict regulation for encampment for March and movement can you imagine now 2.2 million people and they all get ready to move okay they're going somewhere all right well they're moving from here and they're fixing to head down to Greenville will say 2.2 million people well can you imagine them all too hey I'll see you I'll see you down there I'm going down this way hey I know there's a shortcut across the mountain down there and I'm going down there Moses said no no the Levites are going to carry the word on their shoulders and everybody will get right in line and they even had to march in a certain order they had to move in a certain order they had to go to church in a certain order well praise the Lord they had to leave in a certain order they had to move in a certain order they had to change encampment in a certain order well praise the Lord you see God himself is the one who Institute this now notice again every man in his place by their standards so every individual has several identification parts that will identify where it goes so we'll be under a sub count then he will find his own tribal standard and then he will find his own family so the Tabernacle was what it was in the center of all this and came up now notice this you can read this with me on the east side of the camp where the tribes of Judah issachar and sibulan now notice again they did not toss Lots they did not vote well I I like Judah I'd like to be on Jewish side you never got to choose that actually God himself was the one that gave these names to Moses can't you see why the prophet of God told us if we would go to God and ask God Lord why am I here why am I here that we would save ourselves and God so much trouble if we find Where We Belong notice so the east side is the tribes of Judah and issachar and Zebula on the south side of the camp the tribes of Reuben Simeon and Gan on the west side of the camp the tribes of Ephraim manessa and Benjamin now these are the tribes which are all the descendants of Jacob's favorite wife Rachel so God let all of them be in the same camp or in the amazing how he does things on the north side of the camp are the tribes of Dan Asher enough tally let's show them some images Brothers now it was God himself who orchestrated this and this is all by his divine order and I want you to notice an artist's rendition anybody see a symbol in that layout that you recognize what do you see across a cross now look at them how that it's laid out so here are 2.2 million people and notice what is in the middle the Tabernacle so every person's life is supposed to be aimed toward the Tabernacle what's in there the word and Grace of course and the Manna the second eye the presence of God the pillar of fire at night and here they are sitting all around camped around the presence of God that every life should be focused on the word and the word Christ Jesus should be the center of the focal part of the camp Oh I'll tell you one day if we could ever get him the focal part of our life you talking about some camp meetings we'd have some oh my so notice now God is the one who laid this out and even even in the size and all that we've dealt with of course years ago but the the length was a certain size the breath was a certain size so many cubits high so much this so much that silver on this part gold on that part blue on this purple on that so it was not a haphazard something you know I wonder sometimes if we don't take it too lightly when we come to the house of God people won't even pray before they come to church they won't read the Bible they'd rather stand outside and talk 30 minutes before church and then walk right in out of that old carnal Fellowship thing instead of coming in and sitting down and closing their you know the world off to him and reading their Bibles sitting there reading a message book and praying and said oh God come this way to not Lord I've got a need my brothers and sisters have needs I wonder I wonder if it would not make a change and how the presence of God would feel more welcome if we ourselves would put forth effort but we're afraid somehow I think we're so afraid of what God might do but I want you to notice now God is the one who placed him notice these tents how they're set out notice the post they're spaced exactly on the outer wall the stakes are exactly on the outer wall now let me show you some scriptures okay Brothers hold those for a minute just fade out the screen Genesis chapter 22 verse 9. let's see how God relates to order and they came to the place which God had told him of this is Abraham now and Abraham built an altar there and he laid the wood I wonder why I didn't just throw it over in a big pile and just say you know pull that old lighter over there and tell him why am I gonna I don't want to get no form I don't want to get no fashion I'll tell you one thing the glory to God I'm a free man Hallelujah I'm free out here a lot of folks don't even understand Freedom do they I was in such bondage in Pentecost and shouted nearly every night but if I didn't shout I was backslid uh-huh got the spot if you didn't speak in tongues if he didn't run the owls if you didn't do this and that and the other and that's just as much a form as people who said in church and never move their arms and you get under such legalism that if you don't run and don't jump then you ain't had church and you sat around and judged the people around you and let me just go and tell you the truth there's some people in the church that probably never will shout as a matter of fact I doubt very sincerely Jesus ever did you want to see Saint Jesus Christ preach like me do you say Jesus Christ preached out brother Daryl do you think Jesus was a you know some type of evangelist that just run back and forth across the platform but the Bible says he's sat and talked but there was never anybody any more anointed than he was but if we're not careful we sing emotions is the anointing now the anointing will move on our emotion but it does not mean that everybody that is emotional is Anointed if that's so at the Cincinnati Reds ball game they ought to have a great powerful anointing well come on you can see that down into a little deal down here in Elizabethton sometimes the way they scream and holler and carry on they ain't got a bit more anointing than the Man in the Moon now watch Abraham laid the wood in order and bound his son Isaac and he laid him on the wood Exodus 26 17. two tenons now this was a tabernacle that I just showed you there two tenons shall there be in one board now the tenants is what joined it together set in order one against another Thou shalt out make for all the boards of the Tabernacle so once you saw in one board you saw in every other board so it was not random that God said well put two yours through their father y'all just do whatever you want to do I you know I really don't even care y'all just do whatever you want to do you understand that's where laodicea is so if they want to come to church with alcohol on the breath they do I mean go said the way they look at it God you know God loves us the way we are and just be what you are so you just come to church dress anyway live anyway do whatever you want to do and God accept that that is a lie straight from the pits of hell oh yeah you come to God being a drunk he'll save you but there are no drinking Christians oh Hallelujah but we've got Christian drug addicts and we've got Christian alcoholics and now of course we got Christian transgenders you got to be kidding me we've got Christian homosexuals we've got Christian well come on don't sit there and look at me funny we've got pastors that are transgenders we've got Christian pastors that are homosexual I don't care what they say God's word condemns such a thing it is contrary to his Bible but you see when we do away with God's order then we think somehow we will force on God what we want God to have there ain't nobody telling me to clot my hands there ain't nobody telling me to say Amen bless God nobody's telling me that well you're allowed to see a man you see you won't follow God's protocol oh my goodness brother Donnie I'm not going to do such thing well I'll say it as it's been said before you know I don't care if God shouts Me dances me jumps me around jerks my head jerks my foot my leg I don't care what he does I don't care if I speak in tongues singing tongues or crow in tongues as long as I'm saved and filled with the Holy Ghost that's what matters to me I'm more concerned about God's order that I am a lot of folks ordered notice in Exodus 39 37 the pure Candlestick with the lamps thereof even with the two lamps to be set in order and all the vessels thereof and the oil for Life Leviticus 1 7 and the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the Altar and lay the wood in order upon the fire First Kings chapter 18 verse 33 Elijah and he put the wood ah so this is out to the prophets of Baal have jumped and screamed and hollered and carried on why didn't he just go over there and grab a hold of a sacrifice and just cut its net pile it up on the rest that stuff he said I ain't doing nothing like that God's a god of order so what did he do he had Stones brought in and the right amount of stones and he had a ditch dug I imagine taking the wall to set up that church wouldn't you and he went to land it all out he wanted everything to be in order but Divine protocol he knew God had a spiritual numerology he knew it was threes it was fives it was sevens it was 40s it was 21s he knew that God had a spiritual numerology and that God must be worshiped in the right way you all understand the same thing tonight God must be worshiped the right way and I'll tell you what the Jesus said the father is going to seek such to worship him those that worship Him in spirit and in truth some people have a lot of spirit and ain't got much truth a lot of folks have got a lot of Truth so they say and ain't got much spirit I want both here anybody else want that I want spirit and I want truth I'm not interested in fanaticism oh sure I'll take a little bit of wildfire instead of no fire at all but I don't figure we have to have Wildfire or no fire I figure we can have the right amount of word and spirit and worship and singing and praying come on somebody I believe the Lord God wants us to be able to have the divine order that don't mean we don't praise him that don't mean we don't worship him but it means we come with respect into his August course we don't come in and just throw our sacrifice down and just give him whatever we want but we give him things that cost us something sometimes it ain't him wanting your money it's him wanting your hands raised up he knows your arms are tired because you've worked hard today but he says daughter do you love me enough to raise him tired arms do you love me enough son to raise them tired arms oh they're hurting and they're aching more the glory to God if you raise them up when you take them back down you might get healed well that happened to a young brother sitting right here tonight that happened not long ago I made that very remark in the service and he couldn't hardly even raise his arms but he put his arms up in the presence of God and went to Worship in the Lord and what he took him back down they were healed Hallelujah God may be waiting for you to raise them tired arms he may be waiting for you to clap them tired hands he may be waiting for you to put Force the effort well you told my brother this is the order of Melchizedek it is the order of sacrifice it is the order of worshiping God whether you feel like it or whether you don't you go to church and you love and you praise Hallelujah because you are called to do so notice Elijah put the wood in order and cut the Bullock in pieces and laid him on the wood notice everything so meticulously done and said Phil for I mean it was what the number four represents anybody four is the number of Earthly Deliverance Earthly delivers that's what the prophet said fill four barrels less water why not five why not three this time four is the number of Earthly deliverance and the people of God's fixing to be delivered from Baal worship fill four bottles of water and pour it on the sacrifice and on the wood you know the rest of the story First Chronicles 15 13 for because he did it not at the first the Lord Our God made a breach upon us now notice a general Visa broke the Commandment of God and God then made a breach a breach upon the children of Israel for that we sought him not after the do order do you understand there's been four great dispensations since the cross of God pouring out of his anointing from around the throne after each one of those pouring out of the beast's power the people got away from the worship under that do order our time will not be any different Satan will be allowed an opportunity to try to pull us out from under the do order of divine worship and revelation of the word under the eagle anointing but we're not going to let him have it Hallelujah now you saw that's Old Testament well New Testament First Corinthians 11 34 If any man hunger let him eat at home that you come back together into condemnation and the rest will I set Paul the first church hates messenger a man of the Holy Ghost is going to set some things in order in the New Testament Church amen First Corinthians 14 40. let all sings be done oh decently and in order wow so you mean people can worship God and be emotional and I mean I'm talking about having a spell and do it decently it's either spirit of God Will Never Move On a Woman to make her Shout and do it ungodly or a man peace brother Donnie I'm with you brother Donnie Amen brother Tony Lord of God brother Noni see I told you I can do that so this man wants a move of God Among the people but he knows god well enough to know God will never do anything indecent ungodly or filthy praise the Lord yes I told Carol several years ago the message people and many of them have never even seen a Pentecostal move they've never really seen much manifestation of gifts she can stand to be a witness to this tonight we've talked about it several times and I've told her I said if there ever breaks force a move around this message that's of the supernatural order that's gifts it will be absolutely amazing how many people will follow it and leave the word for it why they never saw it and you see if you've never saw it and known what it was because we've had two moves by the same name it's real easy until I use the same name and slip the lighter and try to identify people that it's the former so you can understand what I'm saying we've got two moves call Pentecost the original and the 1906. and if Satan can't convince you that you don't need Pentecost then he'll do his second scheme and that is try to slip in 1906 Pentecost and convince you it's the original praise those are but remember God will never do anything out of order and the church said now I saw a man one night a preacher an attempt down at all been in Kentucky and Carol and I was at that meeting and that preacher prayed for a woman unbuttoned or blouse put his hand right in her blouse uh-huh prayed for her a Godly indecent call me out after he called her out and told me the words that I prayed that day repeated the words of my prayer in the way that I prayed them if that ever breaks out in our ranks God have mercy hello [Applause] God never does anything at order don't you can you imagine how I felt when I was sitting there of course I'm questioning that man absolutely I'm questioning I'm sending us an owl in the world I'm sentenced close to him to brother Benton to where the woman was and I thought Lord say how can that be and call me out right after that and tell me the words that I said and then there you said thinking how can that be oh you can't imagine how I heard a tape July the 25th 1965 the anointed ones at the end time and when I heard that brother Jim I thought oh praise be to God praise be to God thank you Lord no friends I'm not interested in going back to that you know what because that was not the original ax come on that was laodicea and it was a mixture of the good and the bad I want the original I want the truth but I am not accepting no faith I am not accepting a hit and a miss and a hit and a miss and a hit and a miss that might work on your own Model A but I don't want a Model A I want Rapture power I don't want no hit no Miss no hit no mess I need head on all cylinders I need to leave this world we need to get out of this place [Applause] ah notice the meaning of this word this new testament word order I thought the meaning of this in the name of this word in the Greek actually was absolutely beautiful it's the word Taxi t-a-x-i-s Taxi and it means an arrangement Arrangement a fixed succession observing a fixed time orderly condition the post rank or position which one holds in a Civic or other Affairs and since this position generally depends on one's talents experiences resources character fashion quality and style so you mean this is the word that Paul used describing the Church of the Living God Hallelujah so you see God is not against divine order as a matter of fact he's the author of it First Corinthians chapter 16 verse 1 Paul said now concerning the collection for the Saints as I have given to the churches of galatia even so do you Titus 1 5 for this cause left eye thee in Crete that thou shouldest now remember there's over a hundred cities in the island of Crete they had had a Revival from the north to the South very narrow Island thousands of people live there and Paul was God called away and Titus is going in Paul's dead and Titus is actually going to go in the churches and work with the local churches and going to ordain elders you see the church was not multiplied by a one-man feeling led to go here in another and feeling led to go there and another and feeling led to go there but it was organized under the apostolic order well come on somebody preach with it under the apostolic order you didn't just go out and start a church that's not the Bible show me show me you did not go out and start a church on your own you were sent from the church that's how the church gave birth they didn't miscarry they gave birth then Paul had sent this man and he was to ordain Elders in every city well wait a minute what about this guy didn't he fill it feel that show me in your Bible and I'll preach it but until you do I'll preach this and I'll tell you before you even search it you ain't going to find it because it's not the original order now most of us absolutely are so against organization and why are we because it's a man-made system right but not only does man make systems but man makes churches too you see a man-made church does not have a foundation off the word a man-made church does not give birth the way the word says neither does it go out from the church the way the word said testing one two I must be losing and losing you all somehow you see God God will not last oh but we've got God's blessing those sure the children of Israel had them for years and years and every one of them's days was numbered and those unbelievers died in the wilderness and yet God fed them God watered them God give them clothes and ain't none of us God's ever blessed like them and yet they were doomed and Damned the blessing didn't change one thing oh the prophet said a young man come to him not long ago and said brother Branham the lord loves me so much he'll just let me get by with anything I can just do anything I want in case you understand that's what blinds people when they leave the word and the blessing of God continues on they said see that I must be in the will of God I must be in the will of God God's blessing me boy I'll tell you one thing but God is trying you don't you understand why the prophet said in God's chosen a place of worship why this God even allow those other gates in order to tempt you by in order to see will you stay with my word will he allow false prophets to come Among Us yes he will will he allow false preachers to rise up yes he will what for in order to try his bride and when it's all said and done that bride will never move from that word oh my notice Isaiah 62 10. now watch can I have a few more minutes God all down through the Old Testament in various situations and dispensations he would use these terms of lifting up a standard and this was scripture he says go through go through the gates prepare you the way the people cast up cast up the highway gathered out the stone lift up a standard for the people lift up a standard so this was also an illusion to the soldiers because the soldiers in the middle of battle and everybody's fighting and dust is arising and bullish is going off and people are bloody and some of them is falling and some is running you'll imagine trying to find which side you're on and then you wake up in the middle of that battle and you look around and everybody you look at is not on your side and you found yourself in the middle of the battle and you swap sides and you wasn't even aware you had it in the world did you get into that you got under a delusion of some sort you got amnesia and you don't even know which side you go on oh well what am I doing oh no what and what I'm on the enemy's lines I'm on the enemy's side how could that be how am I going to find my way back God said lift up a standard somebody raised up a standard high so they can look and see they got caught away for a little bit they got sidetracked for a little bit but raised a standard that's what I'm trying to do friends I'm trying to raise the standard other true men of God that's what they're trying to do oh they got lots of opposition and it confuses the people because one preacher will lift up this standard and another preacher said no no no don't believe him I've got the standards then another and said no no no both of them are wrong I've got the standard but you remember a god-called man will never leave that word and he won't dissect that word and take one quote here in one quote there and then you send them 52 more and they won't even read one of them there's something wrong with the standard he's flying come on children the Holy Ghost can say Amen to God's word hmm notice I'll say 11 10 and in that day there shall be a root of Jesse hear the Lord Jesus in the prophecy which shall stand for an in sign of the people something lifted up a standard a signal a banner a standard I was a rallying point can't you see we've been here we've been here for many many years and many times we've been here and Satan will raise up a man and he'll start blowing the trumpet and holding up the standard this is it this is the bride's Revival and people go to hearing about him oh yeah they come here they come man they go to moving they go to doing this and that and Heather it don't take them long been there to realize I didn't know bride's Revival it's an emotional stir jumping and shouting around some man in his gift 49-22 thus saith the Lord God behold I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles and set up my standard to the people and they shall bring listen to this they shall bring the Suns and their arms and thy daughter shall be carried upon their shoulders praise God you see whenever it's the standard of God it's not only good for Daddy it's good for Mama it's good for you youngins it's good for the backslider Psalms 60 and 4 thou Hast given a banner something lifted up a standard a signal thou Hast given a banner to them that feare thee that it may be displayed because of the truth oh praise the Lord and I've been wanting to get to this verse right here all night long Song of Solomon Chapter 2. verse 4. he brought me to the banqueting house and His Banner over me was love now what you notice the two-fold of this from the groom to the bride he brought me to the banqueting house actually this word has a couple of different meanings one of them is the house of wines w-i-n-e-s so it wasn't just a kitchen where they sampled it but it was a room where they become so intoxicated revelation after revelation after revelation he brought me to the banqueting house the one use of the Hebrew word there is House of wines but it has multiple aspects and the meaning of the word and it also means that it is a house it signifies wealth and the food that is prepared in this place is not your ordinary Fair it's not your ordinary stuff it's food that are real fine Delicacies now some of this may not sound very fine to some of you but in different parts of the world where I've been some of the people in that place wanted to give me some of their Rarities and I just assume they help them Lord have mercy I mean to them it's precious to them it's you know and I say brother I'll tell you what I I believe I'm fasting today well they take an egg and bury it in the ground and leave it there for several weeks uh-huh and you can imagine what it smells like but to them it is a delicacy you know to the Romans a peacock said on the table before a magistrate on a great banquet a peacock would have been set there and they There's real artisans in the way they would prepare the Italians and they would set it with the tail all spread out in the head and then they would take to meet of course and lay it out so when you walked in there the food you were eating let you know how he thought about you so your rank glory to God your rank and your position and the man giving the banquet the food that he fed you let you know what he thought about you so I don't know I'm telling you little bride he must really think highly of you oh Hallelujah he has not given us a warmed up leftover from Luther on a warmed up leftover from what state but by the bitten all Seven Seals hide them open for those who are ready to receive the word of God Hallelujah so the richest I'm the finest of Culinary Artistry anybody know what that means you bunch of hillbillies you just saw me you don't even know huh fine cooking fancy stuff you know how it is whenever it's around our house oh my you're getting that hum drum of life you know when you just grab paper plates and you know you don't even drag out your China no more we live in such a fast pace and Kobe done something to us I guess but we just drive out to paper plates can you imagine dragging out paper plates on Thanksgiving oh your sisters are reaching there and grab out your fake silver and you'll drag out your platters made in China and you will drag out your fine cups and this and that and the other and boy Mama's coming over and Grandma's coming over and Grandpa's coming over and you spread that table and there's your turkey and dressing and your cranberry sauce and your brown craving white gravy for those who don't like the brown and you've got them fine yeast rolls and that butter you've got that fine honey said no Lord we're gonna have to dismiss and go eat anyway you've got all that said in there but you know what you don't do that every day do you you don't cook like that every day why it's a special occasion well the Lord God has been waiting for this hour he has been waiting for this hour so what's he done he took the special seven seal called glory to God kneel for his weight and Bride on the earth a little jumping and a shout won't get us there it's got to be a fine course it shows us what he thinks about us by the fair that is set before us there can be nothing no better there could be nothing no Richer there could be nothing more edible nothing more suited to the bride than a seven course meal with the power of God anointing the men of God to preach the word of God of the end time okay I was in the Intercontinental Hotel in Nairobi sister hope Kenya several years ago all my whole trip to Africa I was so careful in what I eat and what I drink because I didn't want to get sick I'll brush my teeth and Coke that's what they told me it is why did that you're the Romans you do it the Romans brush their teeth and go then you would Brush Your Teeth Let's Go I wouldn't eat no salad I wouldn't eat nothing but water I said don't do it brother don't do it but we get to that Intercontinental Hotel and I'll walk in there and it's the very last night it's on a Saturday night we're going to have service on Sunday I'm telling you what they had a spread International InterContinental Hotels International Hotel chain around the world I'll walk in there and say Lord have mercy I was a slobber and all mad dog I mean there was beef there was chicken there was all kinds of salads and the and the Kenyans of course under the British influence so they had a lot of really nice food I load up my plate little did I know oh there was some little parasite hanging in one of them our bowls before the daylight struck the next morning I thought I was going to see brother Branham and Gary brother Michael and everybody else in that realm I was so sick I thought I was going to die I was deceived I trusted them people I asked them is this safe for an American yes yes yes oh good oh good I trusted them the next morning I was near the Dead so we're going to church on Sunday morning I'm a brother Doug mccuse I said brother Doug buddy I ain't gonna be able to go to church they

be fine we'll send somebody after you I said no brother duck I'm begging you I can't I can't do this you'll be fine we'll pray for you sure enough they'd send somebody theirs my goodness I don't remember Sister opinion seemed there are a couple thousand people whatever you talking about worshiping God I'm telling you what them Kenyan Believers I'd love to go back and preach to them again before I get it sold I can't go you talking about brother Joel you would turn yourself Inside Out being among them saints they love God I was there several years before them had a tent meeting that's made by 5 000 people there and there's about 40 cars sitting out there all the rest of them that either thumbed or bicycled or whatever I mean they come to have church they wouldn't like us soft Americans they come to the house of God to have church oh my here brother knock on the door I'm saying oh no God I can't do this ain't no way I got up I said brother I can't I'm holding my belly oh god dude God oh God please help me I said brother I can't go better come better than accused said come on brother come what you said come on I said tell her brother come on here I said no he said no brother he said tell you to come on I said I'm not ready he said I'll wait on you every excuse I had he had an answer the point of my story was my whole trip this is my 21st day my whole trip I watched every bite I ate until they convinced me it was good and it was some of the best looking food I'd seen and I ate and I paid I was so weak when I got to church I couldn't hardly even stand up I told the brothers and sisters you're gonna have to walk beside me to get me out there's no way I'm going to get there so they helped me get out on the platform and I took my text read the scriptures and I said a lot to preach to you this morning on a drink for the king where by the time the Lord got done with that service the king had a drink you can imagine I mean them people shot and screaming the anointing come on me in a matter of minutes it was like a jar of bolt of light and hit me I never had not one more stomach pain I never had one more weakness I run I screamed I hollered I shouted there was a wet Trail back and forth across that Pulpit oh my did we have a Time and as soon as the anointing left me and I walked that off that platform I grabbed my belly again I nearly died I know some of y'all remember not when I got home my eyes changed colors my eyes turned the color of orange about that sister's blouse color her blouse it took me weeks and weeks to get over it because the food looks so Sumptuous it looks so nice and they gave me their word this won't hurt you I'd have been better off to brush my teeth and Coke and went to bed preachers will lie to you they will tell you this is God's word this will help you this is what you'll need but don't you never leave God's Great program [Applause] Hallelujah don't you love him so here we are sitting in this Grand banqueting Mouse all the stately dignitaries are there in all the magistive his omnipotence All These Fine Delicacies are there wow we're looking at this food and say man a lot I never see no food like that now when you raise poor like I was we had beans taters and maters and then other meals we had maters taters and beans you see Mama Said in a different way so it makes you think had something more I was giving Eliana a little update on her puppy's background yesterday I took her to a doctor's appointment she's talking how crowded it is in their house and how small their bathroom is and all I said yeah honey I know but I I just don't know what else we can do I just don't know anything else we can do about it I said but let me tell you a story you see when poppy was a little boy we lived in a house that didn't even have a bathroom in it we didn't have running water the running water was me running outside to bring the water in that was running water and Mom and Daddy finally got an FHA loan I was able to build a house I'm sure you remembered Harry little Brick House pretty little house 1200 square feet three bedrooms one bath a mama and a daddy and seven young ones Ellie's conclusion to that story was well I guess we're blessed ah because I got three bathrooms in their house boy when we moved into that house I mean we was uptown we had brick wow and we could go into the bathroom and do this and water would run out of that thing man alive well when I was in Pentecost I eat Chucks every way they could be prepared dried shocks wet Chucks scalloped Chucks deep fried chunks barbecue Chucks marinated Chucks but I don't mind telling you since I've been called to the banqueting Temple of the king I don't eat no more shucks no and then people leaving this word and want to take us with them just cause they lost their mind don't mean we're losing hours we want to go about yourself can you imagine myself some of the people that have said in the message said in message churches and left a message and gone back to trinitarian churches and some of them that was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus had been re-baptized in the name and titles and they said under this message or they may have said under but they sure didn't have no revelation of it but you know the prophet said about some of them people he said this food was too rich for him made him sick to their stomach I've come to realize that some that set in our own church was the same way I preached you hard for him I preached too much of the message for them and I studied too much and I preached too high they'd rather have a preacher that don't really do a lot of preaching and don't really demand much of them you know a lot of folks want a condo priest type just goes around fellowships with everybody and consent preaches about 15 or 20 minutes can you honestly believe that's going to put you in a rapture I desire more than anything in this world to leave here when the Rapture comes and I believe my diet will determine whether I go or not if I'm sitting at the table and he himself is handing me Delicacies here Donnie have you ever tried this before the oh my Lord what is that called deity of Jesus Christ 1949. deity is no longer in heaven but it's on the earth and the hearts of the Believers wow man that is strong stuff that is good stuff Lord you got any more of that you just getting started boy yes I've got more I've got more and there's more to come with it you imagine them sitting down there in the land of Egypt Moses given them again orders take a lamb

by what you eat I listen at what he feeds you I listened to the men of God who come to this Pulpit I listen to them tapes that he sent his Prophet to record for you years and years before you were ever born and he recorded them for you so you could set at the banqueting table Feast on the unfailing body word of the son of man I mean he loves him with all your heart how many has a need in your body tonight or maybe a family member brother Daryl wants you to come and offer prayer please for us how many has a need in your body or maybe someone in your home oh my mama many many hands being uplifted praise the Lord show that testimony with him but if you feel to what you shared with me back that will go praise the Lord I was uh brother Samuel Browning's on Thursday night and a brother came into the study I was wanting a prayer cloth and he was going to take it right after service up to another city to I believe it was his sister-in-law they was hoping that she would be alive when they got there because cancer was consuming her body and so me and brother Browning and the brother prayed over this little piece of prayer cloth and so they they left after service and went up there and brother Samuel sent me a text yesterday that foreign when they got up there she was still alive and she actually gave her heart to the Lord surrendered to the Lord and she said I'm not going out of here in a body bag I'm going to live the tumor was so large in her esophagus that actually caused her lung to collapse since she was on six liters of oxygen the next day she was down to two liters of oxygen there was no fluid in her lungs she was sitting up eating a hamburger and when the doctor came in he said he was totally amazed because he figured she had done be gone but that's just the god that we served amen he's so wonderful me and Cheryl was in Pawnee Oklahoma a week before last I believe it was and brother Joel Pruitt's wife he's been Pruitt's brother from down in Hardy Arkansas she had been bit by a tick that placed the bacteria in her body that made her extremely allergic to any kind of meat they actually gave her an EpiPen and said if you eat some meat unbeknownst and it causes your throat to swell use this pen and so she came up for prayer on Friday night and the saints of God prayed for the sister when the service was over she went over to the fellowship hall ate a big bunch of barbecue I talked to brother Joel the other day said brother now she is completely healed waiting there amen but you know the Lord Jesus he never said did you feel it but he did say did you believe it when Lazarus got the worst news that any man could ever get he said trouble the master no more your little girl is gone Jesus gave you the answer to every bad report you'll ever get when he touched him on the shoulder and said two words only believe only believe do you believe he said brother I've got a problem then you're just a candidate for a miracle all miracles start with a problem amen the day of the accident with brother Homer and Rachel was was killed and Jessica was hurt so bad there was an ambulance there for Rachel's body and I asked if I could put my family in that ambulance so we all gathered in the back of the ambulance and we begin to pray and I told my family he brought us to his banquet table and His Banner Over Us his love that's what we prayed because that's just the kind of God that we serve no matter what we face in life he's got it all in control and the Bible says all things sometimes even when we don't understand it's still working for our good to bring us to that place he had of us in his mind before there's a real world do you love him tonight bro said he wants to heal you a thousand times more than you want to be healed so when
