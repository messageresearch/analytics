[31:04] why shouldn't we so appreciate you being
[31:06] here today
[31:07] just trust the lord's gonna meet with us
[31:09] a wonderful way let me just share just a
[31:11] brief testimony with you before the
[31:13] andrew comes
[31:14] 18 months ago the doctors did a scan on
[31:17] my
[31:18] heart and they found in my lung
[31:22] a nodule since that time they've been
[31:25] scanning me about every six months
[31:28] whenever i had the episode here at the
[31:30] church in march
[31:31] they took them done all kinds of scans
[31:33] and tests and things like that
[31:35] they found three nodules but i had a
[31:38] scan
[31:40] monday and they found
[31:44] no
[31:51] praise the lord
[32:00] we hear so many negative things and so
[32:02] many sad and difficult things
[32:05] but god is moving in some wonderful ways
[32:08] now they gave me no medication no
[32:10] treatment nothing like that
[32:12] and there was a few folks that i'd made
[32:14] it known to so i just believe
[32:16] our father took care of it just like he
[32:18] took care of his sister becky
[32:20] just like he's taking care of others
[32:21] like he's going to take care of erica
[32:23] darler different needs that are around
[32:25] the world why
[32:26] because he loves his children
[32:29] amen we're going to invite brother
[32:32] andrew to come and speak for us been
[32:33] quite some time since he's been here
[32:35] all this covert thing has messed up
[32:37] everything and at church and
[32:39] our everyday life but actually since
[32:41] brother andrew and sister mariah was
[32:43] here last time they've
[32:44] moved from west virginia up to virginia
[32:47] now they attend brother
[32:48] sean martin's church and working out of
[32:50] that church there and brother sean
[32:52] starting their fine brother
[32:54] it don't seem like it's been that many
[32:55] years ago that brother anderson either
[32:58] here or there one
[32:59] a little bitty old guy come up
[33:02] constantly for prayer you know and
[33:04] uh my has gone into a fine fine warriors
[33:08] across
[33:09] preaching the gospel we so love him and
[33:11] sister mariah and certainly appreciate
[33:12] the lord for them
[33:14] i appreciate the visitors being with us
[33:16] this weekend as well
[33:17] can we just sing as we open our hearts
[33:20] now to the lord i'm sure that
[33:22] you didn't come here today to see or to
[33:24] be seen
[33:25] or you didn't come because necessarily
[33:28] you didn't have any other place to go
[33:30] but you have needs desires in your
[33:33] hearts
[33:34] and we believe our father is so mindful
[33:37] of all of those things
[33:38] and remember brother andrews studied i
[33:41] know him well enough to know that that
[33:42] he studied and he's prepared and put a
[33:44] lot of time into it
[33:46] but a preacher does not bring a meeting
[33:48] on his ipad or
[33:49] in a briefcase but a great deal of that
[33:52] service will be determined
[33:54] by the congregation the prophet tells us
[33:56] if a minister has studied and prayed and
[33:59] he walks out into a congregation that's
[34:01] resentful
[34:02] or they're not in the spirit of god he
[34:04] said the presence of the lord won't move
[34:07] but if you walk out into a congregation
[34:10] that's prayed
[34:11] and they're ready and they understand
[34:13] they have a part to play
[34:14] there's no tent on what the lord will do
[34:16] right here this morning
[34:18] i have needs don't you i have needs i
[34:21] have desires i want to be closer to him
[34:23] than i've ever been before
[34:24] i have friends that are so sick and so
[34:27] many people that i know around the world
[34:29] are so desperate
[34:31] amen let's just open our hearts of the
[34:33] lord jesus come and sing touching jesus
[34:35] hey
[34:35] we'll invite our brother to come and
[34:37] just obey the lord
[34:39] we are so privileged to be able to have
[34:41] him today
[34:42] a woman tried
[34:45] so many
[34:49] physicians
[34:51] [Music]
[34:54] it grew worse
[34:57] so to jesus she came
[35:04] [Music]
[35:06] and when that crowd
[35:11] tried to restrain her
[35:17] she whispered these words
[35:23] through her pain why don't you whisper
[35:25] today
[35:28] touching jesus
[35:31] is all that really matters
[35:39] then your life will never be

[36:57] amen we know the prophet of god taught
[36:59] us that sometimes god uses his gift and
[37:01] sometimes the people use his gift and
[37:03] i believe this morning that he's here to
[37:05] speak to us don't you
[37:06] and i believe he's jesus christ the same
[37:08] yesterday
[37:10] today and forever and what his word said
[37:12] is still true do you believe that today
[37:14] amen let's just borrow our hearts
[37:15] together for a word of prayer this
[37:16] morning and

[37:20] felt his presence in the song service
[37:22] this morning and now as we open his word

[39:32] morning and i was telling someone the
[39:34] other day after the shutdown and
[39:36] quarantine everything it's a privilege

[39:56] limb and say it i'm pretty sure billy
[39:58] terry would like for me to tell y'all
[39:59] hello as well
[40:00] it's kind of funny about every time we

[40:04] come to me and say now it's hard to
[40:05] believe the little boy that's sitting
[40:06] next to me sitting in church with me
[40:08] again so
[40:09] we we sure love them and i want to bring
[40:11] greetings to you from them as well
[40:13] but here in the book of proverbs the
[40:14] 24th chapter this morning
[40:17] in the third verse i just have a simple
[40:19] thought on my heart this morning pray
[40:20] it'll just be an encouragement to you
[40:22] in the third verse of proverbs 24 the
[40:25] bible here says
[40:27] through wisdom isn't house builded
[40:30] and by understanding it is established
[40:34] through wisdom is in house builded and
[40:36] by understanding it is established
[40:39] also i'd like to look in the book of
[40:40] first corinthians chapter 3
[40:43] and verse 8 this morning first
[40:45] corinthians 3
[40:48] and verse 8.
[40:52] the bible here says now he that planteth
[40:55] and he that watereth are one and every
[40:58] man shall receive his own reward
[41:00] according to his own labor
[41:02] for we are laborers together with god ye
[41:05] are god's husbandry and i love this paul
[41:08] says ye
[41:08] are god's building according to the
[41:11] grace of god which is given unto me as a
[41:13] wise master builder
[41:15] i have laid the foundation and another
[41:17] build thereon but let every man take
[41:19] heed
[41:20] how he build a therapon for other
[41:23] foundation can no man lay than that is
[41:25] laid which is jesus christ
[41:27] now if any man build upon this
[41:29] foundation gold silver precious stones
[41:31] wood hey stubble
[41:33] every man's work shall be made manifest
[41:36] for the day shall declare it because it
[41:38] shall be revealed by fire
[41:40] and the fire shall try somebody say try
[41:43] the fire shall try every man's work of
[41:47] what sort it is
[41:48] if any man's work abide which he hath
[41:50] built up there on he shall receive a
[41:52] reward if any man's work shall
[41:54] be burned he shall suffer lost but he
[41:56] himself
[41:57] shall be saved also now one other place
[42:00] i want to look in the book of second
[42:02] peter
[42:02] the first chapter proverbs there the
[42:05] bible speaking of building and then paul
[42:08] speaking there in first corinthians
[42:10] three
[42:11] a men of building and a master builder
[42:13] and a foundation
[42:14] but if you're going to build a building
[42:15] you've got to have material right
[42:17] and in the book of second peter the
[42:19] first chapter
[42:20] we find the material beginning in the
[42:22] fifth verse
[42:24] peter says and besides this giving all
[42:27] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[42:30] to your virtue knowledge
[42:31] and to knowledge temperance and the
[42:33] temperance patience and the patience
[42:34] godliness
[42:35] and the godliness brotherly kindness and
[42:37] the brotherly kindness charity
[42:40] for if these things be in you and abound
[42:42] i love what peter says here
[42:44] they make you you believe that this
[42:46] morning they they make you
[42:48] that you shall neither be barren nor
[42:50] unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord
[42:52] jesus christ you believe that this
[42:54] morning we ask the lord to add the
[42:56] blessing to the reading of his word
[42:58] as you may have your seats this morning
[43:00] from those scriptures i want to by the
[43:02] help of the lord
[43:03] just to speak to you for a few moments
[43:04] here and if i would title this i want to
[43:06] speak to you on
[43:09] thank you brother louie it don't fit so
[43:11] you can't have it this morning
[43:13] amen but from those scriptures this
[43:15] morning i want to speak to you on
[43:17] the map the material that god built his
[43:19] church out of
[43:20] the material that god built his church
[43:23] out of and i
[43:23] was listening to the infallible word of
[43:25] god brotherhood says what kind of
[43:26] material
[43:27] are you built out of methodist baptist
[43:30] catholic presbyterian lutheran
[43:31] pentecostal nazarene pilgrim holiness
[43:34] he said if you're not built out of bible
[43:36] material
[43:37] then the boards drove on by the holy
[43:39] ghost you better tear off the boards
[43:42] he says and get built right so there's
[43:44] there's a right kind of building and
[43:45] then there is a wrong kind of building
[43:47] there is a
[43:48] there is a bible building and then there
[43:49] is an unbible building and another place
[43:51] he said i think every christian
[43:53] ought to take the same attitude that's
[43:55] right we want to know where we are
[43:57] standing
[43:58] amen because we don't want our eternal
[44:00] destination
[44:01] built upon the shifting sands of some
[44:03] church theology
[44:05] amen but on the eternal word of the
[44:07] living god see right because remember
[44:09] every one of you sitting here tonight
[44:12] amen or i could say sitting here this
[44:13] morning
[44:14] amen he says are going to face stormy
[44:16] times stormy times
[44:18] is going to hit that building you're
[44:19] sitting in that's right death is going
[44:21] to strike
[44:22] it and you better know what kind of a
[44:24] sand it's built upon or what kind of a
[44:26] foundation that it has now
[44:28] amen i believe this morning that we are
[44:30] not gathered here as just church members
[44:32] i don't believe we're gathered here
[44:33] amen it's just people that want to be
[44:35] identified with some type of religion or
[44:37] just here
[44:38] as a people that wants to be a part of
[44:39] some church but i believe
[44:41] amen that the reason we're here this
[44:43] morning is because god has ordained us
[44:45] to be here
[44:46] amen and before the foundation of the
[44:48] world god placed a predestinated seed
[44:50] in our hearts to be here this morning
[44:52] now i'll tell you this way
[44:54] amen that the people that are sitting
[44:55] next to you this morning they're not
[44:57] common people amen they're
[44:58] amen you're not normal people you're not
[45:00] just average people this morning
[45:02] sometimes
[45:03] while praying and studying i'll read
[45:04] through the bible and read about paul
[45:06] and peter and
[45:07] matthew and mark and luke and john and
[45:09] all through the bible of how
[45:10] amen they went through things they went
[45:12] through trials and they went through
[45:13] tests and they went through
[45:14] disappointments and they went through
[45:16] losses they went through all kinds of
[45:17] things
[45:18] and then something in my mind they'll
[45:19] say my it would be something to meet
[45:21] those people and to talk to those people
[45:23] and see
[45:24] amen what they went through and how they
[45:25] went through it and can they come out of
[45:27] it
[45:27] amen but then it strikes my heart that
[45:29] actually every time i preach to the
[45:31] bride of jesus
[45:32] christ amen i'm preaching the same
[45:34] caliber people amen
[45:35] amen your mate your name might not be
[45:37] mark or luke or matthew or john
[45:39] amen but you've been through some things
[45:41] you've been through some trials amen
[45:43] you've been through some tests you've
[45:44] been through some great losses amen but
[45:46] then it dawns on me that the only reason
[45:48] why we're still here
[45:50] amen as opposed to other people that
[45:52] went through the same thing
[45:53] it's because we're not built out of what
[45:55] they're built out of amen
[45:57] amen we're not made out of what they're
[45:58] made out of listen
[46:00] amen you've been through things that a
[46:01] baptist church would fall apart at
[46:03] you've been through things
[46:04] ain't been that a pentecostal church
[46:06] would run at but the reason why
[46:08] that you're still sitting here this
[46:09] morning is because you're more than just
[46:12] a church
[46:12] amen but you are a paradox you you are a
[46:15] people this morning
[46:16] amen that have been through some things
[46:18] but what you've been through
[46:20] amen was not greater than the god that
[46:22] was on the inside of you
[46:23] amen because there was a scripture
[46:25] concerning you that said greater is he
[46:27] that is
[46:28] in you amen than he that is in the world
[46:30] there was a scripture concerning you
[46:32] amen that if god be for us amen then who
[46:35] can be against us there was a scripture
[46:37] concerning you
[46:38] amen that all things work together amen
[46:41] for the good to them
[46:42] that love the lord let me just go and
[46:43] make an announcement to the devil this
[46:45] morning
[46:45] amen this is not just a church amen this
[46:48] is not just a gathering of people
[46:50] amen but this is the pride of jesus
[46:52] christ amen that has been through wars
[46:55] but the wars can defeat him amen been
[46:57] through battles but the battles couldn't
[46:59] defeat him
[46:59] and when i begin to think about all the
[47:02] things that the church of the living god
[47:04] has been through
[47:05] and then you wonder why we're praising
[47:06] god amen because we know
[47:09] if it hadn't been for the lord that was
[47:11] on our side amen we wouldn't be standing
[47:13] this morning
[47:14] if it hadn't been for god who was rich
[47:16] in mercy that looked beyond all of our
[47:18] failures
[47:19] look beyond all their faults amen and
[47:21] put a robe of righteousness upon us
[47:23] to be able to stand listen church we've
[47:26] not been called to bow
[47:27] we have been called to stand amen and i
[47:30] would be lying to you this morning
[47:31] to tell you it's going to get easier i'd
[47:33] be lying to you to tell you that trials
[47:35] are going to get less
[47:36] amen but i got courage this morning to
[47:38] tell you amen that just as god was with
[47:41] you then
[47:42] he is with you this morning and there is
[47:44] no test
[47:45] amen there is no war there is no fight
[47:47] there is no battle
[47:48] there is nothing that the devil can tow
[47:50] against this church
[47:51] that'll knock her down hey i feel like
[47:54] preaching this morning
[47:55] i think there's a people here this
[47:56] morning that says go ahead and throw it
[47:58] devil
[47:59] and we'll pick up a bat and knock it out
[48:01] of the park we are not made out of stuff
[48:04] amen that falls apart at the first trial
[48:06] we are not a hybrid church this morning
[48:09] we are a spoken word church by the
[48:11] message of the hour
[48:13] we are a people of paradox this morning
[48:15] we are a mystery to the world
[48:17] amen but we are the church amen that god
[48:20] is built amen amen we are a people of
[48:22] paradox
[48:23] we are a people amen that is more than
[48:25] just people that are guessing
[48:27] amen but we are a church of authority
[48:29] amen we are a people of authority
[48:31] this is a message of authority amen
[48:34] you've got a pastor of authority
[48:36] amen there's a faithful ministry of
[48:38] authority now do you see why the devil
[48:40] hates you
[48:40] amen because we're not here presuming
[48:42] this morning but we've
[48:44] actually got supreme authority by the
[48:47] word
[48:48] amen if you listen the message presuming
[48:50] what is going to tell you to presume
[48:52] actually means to venture without actual
[48:55] authority
[48:55] amen now you find the world is in a
[48:57] presuming state
[48:59] amendment said the church world amen
[49:01] paraphrase in the whole world
[49:02] has moved under presuming amen politics
[49:05] are presuming
[49:06] religion is presuming government is
[49:08] presuming
[49:09] science is presuming education
[49:11] everything around us is presuming
[49:14] but this is not the hour amen to be
[49:16] presuming for a prophet would say
[49:18] we're not presuming anything we see it
[49:21] we know that god is here and the holy
[49:23] spirit the great god of elijah
[49:25] the holy ghost the witness of the last
[49:27] day is pulling his ministry
[49:30] amen right into the church amen the same
[49:32] thing that our lord did
[49:34] the high priest is descending from the
[49:37] throne
[49:37] to the church amen the high priest is
[49:40] descending from the throne
[49:42] into the church and the church is
[49:44] heaping itself up with the word
[49:46] because he can only come to the word and
[49:47] he is the word the word cannot come to
[49:50] an almanac
[49:50] it will not fit so the word has to come
[49:53] to the word
[49:54] amen now do you see why amen that
[49:56] cancers are leaving
[49:58] bodies now do you see why that nodules
[50:00] amen are leaving lungs now do you see
[50:02] why
[50:03] amen that sickness is losing its hold on
[50:05] the church of the living god
[50:07] because the high priest is descending
[50:09] from his throne
[50:10] into the church in this age let me say
[50:12] this morning we ought to make him
[50:14] welcome
[50:15] amen we ought to make it welcome this
[50:17] morning the same high priest
[50:19] that blind bartimaeus touched amen the
[50:21] same high priest
[50:22] that the woman with issue of blood is in
[50:25] this building this
[50:26] morning and you can touch the hymn of
[50:28] this karma and in the moment
[50:30] in the tweaking of an eye everything
[50:31] that's wrong can be made right
[50:33] when the high priest comes in the church
[50:37] that's why we're still here this morning
[50:39] because the high priest is here
[50:42] that's why we don't fear doctors reports
[50:44] because the high priest is still here
[50:46] that's why we don't fear what man can do
[50:48] to us because the mighty conqueror
[50:51] is still in the church of the living god
[50:53] in these last days
[50:55] yes sir the god of abraham isaac and
[50:58] jacob is here
[50:59] therefore when we receive these trials
[51:01] when we receive these situations
[51:03] we don't have to presume we're going to
[51:05] be okay
[51:07] we don't have to presume we're going to
[51:08] overcome we don't have to presume
[51:11] that we're going to get victory we have
[51:13] supreme scriptural authority
[51:15] to stand up and say i'm not going to get
[51:17] the victory
[51:18] but i've already got the victory
[51:20] [Music]
[51:20] [Applause]
[51:21] victory is not coming amen victory is
[51:24] here
[51:25] see you say then what are you talking
[51:26] about i'm talking about a church
[51:28] amen that god called amen not a church
[51:30] that man made but a church that god
[51:32] called
[51:33] and when god calls something he equips
[51:35] what he calls
[51:36] if god calls a man to preach he'll give
[51:38] him something to say
[51:40] if he calls somebody to sing he'll give
[51:42] them something to sing about
[51:43] if he calls somebody to teach he'll give
[51:45] them something to teach about see
[51:47] amen then if god calls him he doesn't
[51:49] expect him to go to a seminary
[51:51] amen and find some material amen to
[51:53] fulfill the call upon his life
[51:55] amen but he's actually born with the
[51:57] material in him
[51:58] that when the quickening power of the
[52:00] holy ghost overshadows
[52:02] what is laying inside of him it'll cause
[52:04] a resurrection in that man
[52:06] and he'll stand there in the face of
[52:08] every unbelieving giant
[52:09] he'll stand there in the face of every
[52:11] philistine he'll stand there
[52:13] in the face of every skeptic and critic
[52:15] and say though you slay me
[52:17] amen yet i'll trust him amen though the
[52:19] skin worms
[52:20] destroy this body yet in my flesh i'll
[52:23] see god
[52:26] i'm talking about the church that god
[52:28] built i'm not talking about something
[52:30] was hatched out of bob jones university
[52:33] i'm talking about something that left
[52:35] the genes of god
[52:36] as an eternal word as an eternal
[52:39] substance
[52:40] my to think this morning when god calls
[52:42] a man to do anything
[52:43] he completely equips him with everything
[52:46] he has need of
[52:47] god always completely equips his man
[52:52] god always somebody shout completely he
[52:55] completely equips his man
[52:56] then in genesis chapter 6 you'll hear of
[52:59] a man named noah
[53:00] amen god actually called noah amen and
[53:03] he called him to do something he called
[53:04] him to build an ark
[53:05] now if you study brethren says god
[53:07] actually give noah
[53:08] amen the word or the order the form and
[53:11] the use of the ark
[53:12] in genesis chapter 6 13 and god said in
[53:15] the noah
[53:16] the end of all flesh is come before me
[53:18] for the earth is filled with violence
[53:20] through them and behold i will destroy
[53:23] them with the earth
[53:24] notice here in verse 14 make thee an ark
[53:27] amen make me an ark of gopher wood amen
[53:30] room shalt thou make in the ark
[53:32] and shall pitch it within without the
[53:33] pitch and this
[53:35] is the fashion which thou shall make it
[53:37] of the length of the ark
[53:39] shall be 300 cubits the breadth of it
[53:41] fifty cubits
[53:42] and the half of it thirty cubits amen a
[53:44] window shout they'll make to the ark and
[53:46] in a cubit shout they'll finish it
[53:48] above and the door of the ark shalt thou
[53:51] set in the side thereof
[53:52] with lower second and third story shall
[53:55] they make it and behold i and i speaking
[53:57] of himself here
[53:58] behold i god even i do bring a flood
[54:01] of waters upon the earth and destroy
[54:04] somebody say destroy
[54:06] destroy all flesh wherein is the breath
[54:08] of life from under heaven
[54:10] and everything that is in the earth
[54:11] shall die but with thee
[54:13] amen i ain't got time to preach here all
[54:15] day but with thee amen well i'll
[54:17] establish my covenant
[54:19] and thou shalt come into the ark amen
[54:21] thou shalt come into the ark
[54:23] and then thou and thy sons and thy wife
[54:25] and thy son's wife with thee
[54:26] and of every living thing of all flesh
[54:29] two of every sort shall thou bring in
[54:30] the ark
[54:31] to keep them alive from with thee they
[54:33] shall be male and female
[54:35] of fouls after their kind of cattle
[54:37] after their kind
[54:38] of creeping thing of the earth after its
[54:40] kind two of every sort shall come unto
[54:42] thee
[54:42] to keep them alive and take thou unto
[54:45] thee all of the flood
[54:46] that is eat the food that is eaten and
[54:48] shall gather it to thee and shall be for
[54:50] food thee
[54:51] and for them notice here in verse 22 of
[54:53] genesis 6
[54:54] thus did noah according to all that god
[54:58] commanded him so did he amen i want you
[55:01] to catch something here
[55:03] noah's works expressed to man what his
[55:05] faith was
[55:06] in god's promise see god met noah and
[55:09] said no
[55:09] it's going to rain i'm going to destroy
[55:11] the whole earth with water now it never
[55:13] had rain that's the impossibility
[55:15] but said prepare an ark amen of the
[55:17] dimensions that i tell you about
[55:19] and him being a carpenter amen him being
[55:22] i studied the day and i caught this
[55:23] him being a carpenter any carpenters
[55:26] here know that when you get a set of
[55:27] plans
[55:28] the first thing you do is you look at
[55:29] them and then when you look at him you
[55:31] say well maybe we could change this or
[55:32] do this so different
[55:33] amen but notice here noah didn't
[55:35] question nothing he didn't say well god
[55:37] maybe we shouldn't make it so big
[55:39] maybe we should put three stories in it
[55:41] maybe maybe we should just leave this
[55:42] out but god
[55:43] gave noah the instructions amen and noah
[55:46] took those instructions
[55:47] and he went to work and fixed it up
[55:50] there with the of wood
[55:51] and put the pitch in at my i love this
[55:54] put the pitch in it
[55:55] and then he began to put the pitch in it
[55:57] he began to put the foot of dies
[55:59] amen put everything there and the
[56:00] prophet said they come by
[56:02] and said this man is actually crazy
[56:04] because he says it's going to bring
[56:05] waters out of heaven
[56:07] and there's no water up there but you
[56:08] see noah didn't think about that
[56:10] because his works was expressing to the
[56:12] people what his faith was and what god
[56:14] had said
[56:15] that's the reason the genuine christian
[56:17] amen separates himself from everything
[56:20] but the word of god no matter what the
[56:22] people think what anybody else says
[56:24] he isn't just saying that if he is it
[56:26] won't be too long
[56:27] till his works will be made known see
[56:30] had noah changed one thing on the ark
[56:32] amen the flood would have revealed amen
[56:34] what he changed on the ark because that
[56:37] ark wouldn't have been swimming
[56:38] it would have been sinking amen but
[56:40] because noah amen was a god-called man
[56:43] who received a god supernatural
[56:45] commission he went to work
[56:46] and the prophet said see we didn't know
[56:48] this amen but there were other boats in
[56:50] those days
[56:51] we didn't know until a prophet came
[56:52] along that there was other boats there
[56:54] was amen there was a baptist boat there
[56:56] was a pentecostal
[56:57] that was a presbyterian but amen let's
[56:59] bring it around us there was a return
[57:01] ministry boat that was the seven
[57:02] thunderbolt there was a peru there was
[57:04] all kinds of boats
[57:05] amen but there was only one boat amen
[57:08] that god had made a covenant with a man
[57:10] to build it
[57:10] and that man's name was noah and that
[57:13] boat was called the ark
[57:15] and the prophet said when noah went to
[57:17] building on this he was building a boat
[57:19] that would stem the great tides he said
[57:21] see they looked at noah
[57:22] and said noah our boat will float as
[57:24] much as your boat
[57:26] he said oh he said i belong to this
[57:28] church and i joined over here and it's
[57:29] as good as yours
[57:30] he said remember when the floods came
[57:32] amen only the god constructed boat
[57:35] floated
[57:36] when the floods came only the god
[57:39] constructed boat floated
[57:41] amen every other boat sunk to the bottom
[57:43] amen but noah's boat
[57:45] amen went riding across the waves amen
[57:47] why because it was god inspired
[57:49] it was god instructed are y'all hearing
[57:51] me this morning amen let me just ask you
[57:54] happy valley
[57:54] why is this church still standing amen
[57:57] why is this ministry still standing
[57:59] because it's not a man-built church it's
[58:01] not a man-built ministry
[58:03] it's not a man-built mood it's the
[58:05] inspiration
[58:06] of the almighty god that has been
[58:08] released in this generation
[58:09] amen to raise up a church that'll stand
[58:12] when she's surrounded by every devil in
[58:14] hell with every gun pointed at her
[58:16] and she can't find a close place to go
[58:19] and hide from the weapons
[58:20] but she is built by stuff that if you
[58:22] shoot her it won't kill her
[58:24] if you cut her it won't stop her if you
[58:26] hit her it won't defeat her
[58:27] come on church i'm not talking about an
[58:29] invincible army coming
[58:31] i'm saying this morning there is an
[58:33] invincible army here
[58:38] oh brother andrew i'm looking for the
[58:40] invincible army look no further
[58:42] you're looking at it this morning i'm
[58:44] looking for the invincible church look
[58:45] no further
[58:46] behold her this morning i'm looking for
[58:48] the invincible youth
[58:50] group look no further you found it this
[58:52] morning what are you talking about
[58:53] brother andrew
[58:54] i'm talking about the church amen that
[58:56] god has designed
[58:58] and he's raised up a ministry ain't
[59:00] meant to build that church
[59:01] he said see unless that boat is
[59:03] constructed by god it will not stand
[59:06] it's got to be holy ghost material it's
[59:08] got to be holy ghost material
[59:10] and holy ghost material amen makes holy
[59:13] ghost people
[59:14] see a cypress boat material makes a
[59:16] cypress boat
[59:17] a poplar makes a poplar boat see what i
[59:19] mean and a whirly material makes a
[59:22] whirly church
[59:22] amen but a holy ghost material
[59:26] but a holy ghost material makes a holy
[59:29] ghost church
[59:30] amen see this morning we're not a worthy
[59:32] church
[59:33] amen we are not a cypress church we we
[59:36] are not a popular church this morning
[59:37] we are a holy ghost church which has
[59:40] received holy ghost material from the
[59:42] word to build
[59:43] my amen now this is what i love amen his
[59:46] nose construction
[59:48] was according to his instruction see in
[59:50] the face of everything that was against
[59:52] noah
[59:52] he still kept building according to what
[59:55] god
[59:56] had revealed the prophet said he knowed
[59:58] that his construction
[59:59] had been according to his instruction
[1:00:01] and i wonder if our construction
[1:00:03] will compare with the instructions we
[1:00:06] have been given
[1:00:07] can you imagine how many days noah was
[1:00:09] out there working and they would come by
[1:00:10] and see him up there hammering away on
[1:00:12] that ark
[1:00:12] and they would laugh at him they would
[1:00:15] come by
[1:00:16] and see no out there pitching that thing
[1:00:18] back and forth with tar
[1:00:19] and they would make fun of him but it
[1:00:21] never discouraged him
[1:00:22] amen it never stopped him amen they
[1:00:25] never had enough power over him
[1:00:27] amen to get his eyes off of what god had
[1:00:30] called him and commissioned him to do
[1:00:31] now brethren says it this way he said
[1:00:33] see paraphrase it
[1:00:34] can you imagine when noah's family amen
[1:00:37] god in the ark
[1:00:38] amen now it might have been a bunch of a
[1:00:40] bunch of laughter in a bunch of hard
[1:00:41] times
[1:00:42] but when they got in the ark i guarantee
[1:00:44] you noah's message
[1:00:46] amen was more valuable to them then than
[1:00:48] it was the first day they heard it
[1:00:50] because they raised the window in the
[1:00:52] ark when the floods began to fall
[1:00:54] and they begin to see their friend's
[1:00:56] boat seeking they begin to see this boat
[1:00:58] seeking
[1:00:58] they begin to see that boat seeking and
[1:01:00] the prophet of god said but they begin
[1:01:02] to feel the ark arise
[1:01:04] he said it this way amen she began to
[1:01:06] rise till she
[1:01:07] left the ground amen are y'all hearing
[1:01:09] me this morning that's that's shout
[1:01:11] material right there
[1:01:12] amen that's preaching material she left
[1:01:14] the ground when they opened the windows
[1:01:16] everything around them was seeking amen
[1:01:19] but they were rising
[1:01:20] amen why were they rising because they
[1:01:22] were not built
[1:01:23] out of denomination they were not peeled
[1:01:25] out of creeds
[1:01:26] they were not built out of stuff that
[1:01:28] would blow apart but they were built
[1:01:30] out of the very breath of god himself
[1:01:32] and i say this morning church
[1:01:34] let him laugh at this church let him
[1:01:35] ridicule you brother donny let him blast
[1:01:37] your
[1:01:38] name all over the world but one of these
[1:01:40] mornings
[1:01:42] hey one of these mornings we're going to
[1:01:44] open up
[1:01:45] and we're going to see this seeking and
[1:01:47] that seeking but we're going to begin to
[1:01:49] feel
[1:01:50] amen a charge of the holy ghost coming
[1:01:52] in our body
[1:01:53] it'll be the same charge that enoch felt
[1:01:56] it'll be the same fire
[1:01:58] that caught elijah up and it'll lift us
[1:02:00] off the ground
[1:02:01] and in the moment in the twinkling of an
[1:02:03] eye there won't be hiding their hair
[1:02:05] you may think i lost my mind this
[1:02:07] morning but just go ahead and join me
[1:02:09] i'm going to leave here one of these
[1:02:11] days
[1:02:12] [Applause]
[1:02:13] [Music]
[1:02:15] let them laugh at us let them make fun
[1:02:17] of us but
[1:02:18] god built us and in the face of every
[1:02:21] skeptic we'll stem ever tide
[1:02:23] we'll crest every wave ah
[1:02:26] the other sink the other saint man you
[1:02:29] imagine what a
[1:02:30] you imagine why the heaviness was on
[1:02:31] noah's heart when he looked
[1:02:34] out there and saw them boat seeking when
[1:02:36] he had done everything in his power to
[1:02:37] tell him
[1:02:38] build it the way god said and they began
[1:02:41] to sink
[1:02:42] he said satan tried him he tried to
[1:02:44] discourage him
[1:02:45] he tried to discourage him to the people
[1:02:47] of that day through the religions of
[1:02:49] that day
[1:02:49] through the science of that day but noah
[1:02:52] delivered somebody shot delivered
[1:02:54] noah delivered what he received and what
[1:02:57] he received
[1:02:58] delivered those who received what god
[1:03:00] delivered to him
[1:03:03] that's pretty good right there i thought
[1:03:04] that up myself amen amen noah delivered
[1:03:07] what he received and what he received
[1:03:09] delivered those
[1:03:10] are y'all hear me this morning amen then
[1:03:12] what you're hearing

[1:03:18] seminary they didn't get this material
[1:03:20] amen from liberty university they didn't
[1:03:23] get this material
[1:03:24] amen from oral roberts studio they got
[1:03:26] this material

[1:03:36] thoughtful ministry

[1:03:40] until my church
[1:03:41] begins to go from faith and to virtue
[1:03:44] and to knowledge under temperance
[1:03:46] until the very headstone that the
[1:03:48] builder is rejected
[1:03:49] amen returns and it'll be the triumphal
[1:03:52] entry

[1:07:30] by larry was when i realized
[1:07:32] there was people around this message
[1:07:33] that you could read and what brother
[1:07:35] brahman said
[1:07:35] and they'd still argue with it well it
[1:07:38] got quite there but it's the truth
[1:07:40] anyhow
[1:07:40] amen you could tell him a prophet said
[1:07:42] it and they'd say well let me tell you
[1:07:43] what he meant
[1:07:44] and let me let me let me put a little
[1:07:45] twist on that so you'll understand
[1:07:47] because you're just a young
[1:07:48] whippersnapper
[1:07:49] you don't know very much you're exactly
[1:07:51] right amen but if our young girls
[1:07:53] amen and our young people and our church
[1:07:56] members have got to guts to live this
[1:07:58] message
[1:07:58] don't you think it's time some people
[1:08:00] get the guts to believe what a prophet
[1:08:02] said
[1:08:03] well it ain't popular brother freddie i
[1:08:05] didn't come to talk about popularity
[1:08:07] that's when the three things will take a
[1:08:08] preacher down it'll take a church town
[1:08:10] but when there is a bride standing there
[1:08:12] that knows who she is she can read what
[1:08:14] a prophet said
[1:08:15] and say the same thing mary said be it
[1:08:18] unto me lord
[1:08:19] if he said it i believe it i receive it
[1:08:23] and that settles it
[1:08:27] oh you gotta you gotta receive it when
[1:08:30] when paul said there in first
[1:08:31] corinthians 15 i delivered unto you that
[1:08:33] which i received
[1:08:34] the word delivered means amen to
[1:08:36] verbally instruct another
[1:08:39] to deliver something verbally
[1:08:42] now surely received means to pick up the
[1:08:44] book
[1:08:45] and get the tape and put the pictures on
[1:08:47] the wall and get the briefcase and get
[1:08:49] everything like brother
[1:08:50] is that what it means no a prophet says
[1:08:52] it this way
[1:08:53] or rather the bible says it means not to
[1:08:55] withhold obedience
[1:08:56] [Applause]
[1:08:58] not to withhold obedience amen you can
[1:09:01] say you receive this message
[1:09:02] but if you're still disobeying it you
[1:09:04] didn't receive it because to receive it
[1:09:07] means you give yourself to it you
[1:09:09] release your ideas about it
[1:09:11] you throw aside your traditional views
[1:09:13] you let the holy ghost tear down
[1:09:15] amen that traditional veil until what a
[1:09:17] prophet said become so sure to you
[1:09:20] that you'll build your home opponent
[1:09:22] you'll build your marriage opponents
[1:09:23] you'll build your family opponents
[1:09:25] you'll even build a church opponent
[1:09:27] because you know it's going to stand
[1:09:29] the test of time ah the hallelujah
[1:09:35] the bible of god said in the church age
[1:09:36] book he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:09:38] what the spirit says unto the churches
[1:09:40] see it may be that millions will hear
[1:09:42] these words or read them
[1:09:43] but how many will pay heed to them that
[1:09:46] we do not know
[1:09:47] but he who will lend his ear
[1:09:50] he who will lend his ear see when you
[1:09:52] lend something somebody doesn't beg you
[1:09:54] for it
[1:09:55] you willfully lend it you willfully give
[1:09:59] yourself to it
[1:10:00] amen and i thank god this morning that
[1:10:02] we've got a faithful ministry
[1:10:03] that has willfully lent their ear to
[1:10:06] these tapes
[1:10:07] they have willfully lent their ear amen
[1:10:09] to what a prophet said
[1:10:11] and they're not mixing it with what a
[1:10:12] man thinks but they're delivering to the
[1:10:14] church
[1:10:15] what the prophet said would deliver that
[1:10:17] church and by that manifestation
[1:10:19] of the spirit of god this is not a
[1:10:21] church that is in darkness this morning
[1:10:23] but it is a church that the spirit of
[1:10:26] god has enlightened us
[1:10:27] by the message of the hour amen y'all
[1:10:31] hear me this morning
[1:10:32] anybody here still thank god for the
[1:10:33] message amen you thank god for the
[1:10:35] prophet
[1:10:36] that's the only reason why there's a lot
[1:10:38] in this building this morning
[1:10:39] that's the only reason why there's
[1:10:41] enough power in this church that if a
[1:10:43] sick person
[1:10:44] come the altar we can lay our hands upon
[1:10:46] them it's because somebody
[1:10:47] amen has received the supernatural
[1:10:50] message of the hour
[1:10:51] amen to deliver it to a supernatural
[1:10:53] people and by that supernatural
[1:10:55] commission
[1:10:56] it'll bring a supernatural deliverance
[1:10:58] right here in this church this morning
[1:11:01] see in order to accomplish a project hey
[1:11:03] i can't even teach for preaching this
[1:11:05] morning
[1:11:06] i've got a whole foundation laying even
[1:11:08] later yet in order to accomplish a
[1:11:10] product a project amen there has to be a
[1:11:13] master
[1:11:13] there has to be one raise up in charge
[1:11:16] there has to be one stand up
[1:11:18] amen do you realize the ark would have
[1:11:20] never gotten built
[1:11:21] had no one left the instructions opened
[1:11:24] for opinions
[1:11:26] it would have never got built had noah
[1:11:28] said now what do you think about this
[1:11:30] and brother what do you think about this
[1:11:31] brother now man what do you thinks would
[1:11:32] change
[1:11:33] it would have never got built amen he
[1:11:35] would well let's just preach here this
[1:11:36] morning
[1:11:37] that has still been going around the
[1:11:38] mountain amen waiting on waiting on
[1:11:40] something to come
[1:11:42] amen but when they realized this is more
[1:11:44] than a man
[1:11:45] when they realize this is more than just
[1:11:47] a preacher amen but this is a man that
[1:11:49] god met
[1:11:50] and this is not a two-headed job this is
[1:11:52] a hand
[1:11:53] the prophet said anything that has two
[1:11:55] hedges deformed
[1:11:56] he said god never had two heads in his
[1:11:59] church
[1:12:00] he never had two heads in his church he
[1:12:03] said he's always had one
[1:12:04] amen and he said that one will be the
[1:12:06] final absolute see then what that tells
[1:12:08] me is
[1:12:09] is christ will become the final absolute
[1:12:12] of the church in the last days amen
[1:12:14] christ will raise up and be the master
[1:12:17] builder
[1:12:17] amen christ will raise up and be the
[1:12:20] vision to the church
[1:12:21] amen christ will raise up and be the
[1:12:23] voice that we all follow come on church
[1:12:25] i'm not talking about some man somewhere
[1:12:28] because of the personality's god
[1:12:29] he thinks we ought to lend our ear to
[1:12:31] what he's got to say i'm talking about a
[1:12:33] people
[1:12:33] amen that knows if anything's got two
[1:12:35] heads it ain't never going to get done
[1:12:37] but if one man raises up and says this
[1:12:40] is the direction we're going
[1:12:41] and everybody catches the vision
[1:12:45] see then that vision will become christ
[1:12:47] and christ is the vision
[1:12:49] and the bible is christ he said that he
[1:12:52] will be the principal theme
[1:12:53] amen he should be the principal theme he
[1:12:55] should be the principal theme of our
[1:12:57] talking
[1:12:57] of our thinking of our singing of our
[1:13:00] walks amen
[1:13:01] he should be the principal theme of our
[1:13:03] life then he should be
[1:13:05] the principal theme of everything we do
[1:13:08] and everything we say
[1:13:09] should be centered around the master
[1:13:12] which is
[1:13:13] christ amen can i preach this morning
[1:13:15] amen the master which is christ
[1:13:18] see then let me say it this way only
[1:13:19] what's done by christ
[1:13:21] amen will last amen and what's done for
[1:13:24] christ
[1:13:25] will last see if you do it apart from
[1:13:27] christ
[1:13:28] then you might as well close the doors
[1:13:30] you might as well turn off the lights
[1:13:32] you might as well padlock the doors
[1:13:34] because if christ is not in it
[1:13:36] it's a meaningless gathering of people
[1:13:37] with a bunch of ideas
[1:13:39] and a bunch of fussing and a bunch of
[1:13:40] cotton and a bunch of this and a bunch
[1:13:42] of that but if christ comes in our midst
[1:13:45] oh i tell you this morning church i say
[1:13:47] come on in christ
[1:13:49] come on in happy valley come on the
[1:13:51] pulpits come across the platform
[1:13:53] come on church if christ comes in here
[1:13:55] it'll be more than just gathering three
[1:13:57] times a week
[1:13:58] if christ comes in here this message
[1:14:00] will be more than something
[1:14:01] you was just raised in but it will
[1:14:03] become the very the very the very
[1:14:05] pulsation
[1:14:06] of why you're living will be the reason
[1:14:08] of the message
[1:14:10] now i'm just going to buckle down here
[1:14:11] and preach for a second amen because
[1:14:13] i've come to place that if christ
[1:14:15] ain't in it i don't want no part of it i
[1:14:18] don't care if it is even around this
[1:14:19] message
[1:14:20] if christ is not in it andrew glover
[1:14:23] don't want no part of it
[1:14:24] because it's only a matter of time
[1:14:26] before enough pressure comes down
[1:14:28] upon it that it blows apart and this man
[1:14:30] reveals who he is
[1:14:32] and this system reveals what was the
[1:14:33] motive and objective amen but if christ
[1:14:35] is in it
[1:14:36] then we will fulfill the words of the
[1:14:38] psalmist david when he stood and said
[1:14:40] except the lord built the house amen
[1:14:43] they that labor and pain build it
[1:14:45] except the lord keep the city they that
[1:14:47] watcheth and wakeeth
[1:14:48] are in vain amen but can i announce to
[1:14:50] you happy valley
[1:14:52] amen 30 years of this ministry amen 30
[1:14:54] years of this church
[1:14:55] all that's been done has been done
[1:14:57] around christ
[1:15:00] are y'all hearing me is this okay has
[1:15:03] been done around christ
[1:15:04] you say what are you talking about i'm
[1:15:06] talking about a pastor with a vision of
[1:15:08] the message
[1:15:09] i'm talking about church with the this
[1:15:11] and the message i'm talking about
[1:15:12] somebody
[1:15:13] that had one thing in mind that was go
[1:15:15] find the stones
[1:15:16] that god fully ordained to be a part of
[1:15:19] this stature
[1:15:19] and let's build it up let's forget our
[1:15:22] ideas let's forget our agendas
[1:15:24] rather matthew let's forget what we
[1:15:26] think and remember what a prophet taught
[1:15:28] in this generation oh you said andrew
[1:15:31] what are you talking about
[1:15:32] i'm talking about christ has returned in
[1:15:35] this age
[1:15:35] christ is the master of the building now
[1:15:38] do you realize the bible says there in
[1:15:39] corinthians
[1:15:40] that paul was a master builder amen
[1:15:43] which he's saying here
[1:15:44] paul was a master builder the reason he
[1:15:46] was is because christ was in him
[1:15:48] see this morning amen if you've got a
[1:15:50] murderer right if you've got a man
[1:15:52] that's a murderer
[1:15:53] he's a murderer but if he gets the
[1:15:55] spirit of john dillinger
[1:15:56] john dillinger was the master murderer
[1:15:58] so then he gets that spirit
[1:16:00] that spirit comes in him he becomes a
[1:16:02] master murderer
[1:16:03] because the spirit of the master came in
[1:16:07] is that okay all right now let's preach
[1:16:09] here for a second
[1:16:10] amen if you've got a piano player he's
[1:16:12] another piano player
[1:16:13] until the spirit of beethoven which was
[1:16:16] the master pianist
[1:16:17] come off of beethoven into him then he
[1:16:19] becomes a master pianoist
[1:16:21] see then whatever the spirit of the
[1:16:23] master comes into
[1:16:25] it automatically makes that the master
[1:16:28] over whatever you're talking about
[1:16:30] see then if paul was a builder because
[1:16:32] he didn't receive the spirit of gamalia
[1:16:34] he didn't receive the spirit of the
[1:16:35] sadducees but he stayed there until he
[1:16:37] received
[1:16:38] amen the spirit of christ then when the
[1:16:40] spirit of christ come in him
[1:16:42] then paul could say i am a master
[1:16:45] builder
[1:16:46] all that let's bring it here this
[1:16:47] morning church amen paul
[1:16:49] was not talking about a building he was
[1:16:51] talking about a surrendered vessel
[1:16:53] that christ could claim see it was
[1:16:55] christ building through
[1:16:57] paul oh church amen can i take some
[1:17:00] liberty here do you see why you're still
[1:17:02] here this morning
[1:17:04] it's not because just to ban brother
[1:17:05] donnie it's because a man
[1:17:07] surrendered his vessel to christ and
[1:17:09] christ came down
[1:17:10] and claimed that vessel and it's been
[1:17:12] christ from this pulpit
[1:17:14] amen year in and year out trial in
[1:17:18] and trial has been behind this pulpit
[1:17:21] building
[1:17:22] the church of the last days not out of
[1:17:24] worldly material
[1:17:25] but out of holy ghost material
[1:17:31] see is christ the master builder
[1:17:33] returning
[1:17:34] amen what is a master builder he is an
[1:17:36] architect
[1:17:37] he is the superintendent he is the the
[1:17:39] one that erects a building
[1:17:41] he is the creator of that building see
[1:17:43] paul was not talking
[1:17:44] about a physical building can i preach
[1:17:48] he was talking about a people see the
[1:17:50] church was not a building
[1:17:51] the church was a body of people who
[1:17:54] truly believed in jesus christ the
[1:17:56] master builder
[1:17:58] and god gave paul amen the grace the
[1:18:01] strength and the power
[1:18:02] and the ability to reach people for
[1:18:04] jesus christ
[1:18:06] and to assemble them together into a
[1:18:08] body to do one thing
[1:18:10] that is not worship him or worship what
[1:18:12] he's doing
[1:18:13] but worship god that is giving the grace
[1:18:16] and the strength and the power and the
[1:18:19] ability to accomplish what is being
[1:18:21] accomplished
[1:18:23] are you hearing me this morning see that
[1:18:25] where they met did not matter
[1:18:27] oh i got to be careful here because i
[1:18:29] could catch a second wind and preach all
[1:18:31] day
[1:18:31] where they met didn't matter they could
[1:18:33] meet in a hut
[1:18:34] and they would have church they could
[1:18:36] meet in a field and they would have
[1:18:37] church
[1:18:38] they could meet in a backyard and they
[1:18:40] would have church they could meet in a
[1:18:41] public building
[1:18:42] or a church building because the
[1:18:44] building was not the church
[1:18:46] the church was the building in the
[1:18:48] building
[1:18:49] [Applause]
[1:18:51] we few few months ago when all this
[1:18:53] shutdown took place our building there
[1:18:55] at home with
[1:18:55] with all the people there at the church
[1:18:56] it was we couldn't we couldn't socially
[1:18:58] distance in there so we
[1:18:59] we started out with going over and
[1:19:00] getting the brother in the church
[1:19:01] brother chris morris
[1:19:02] he's got a nice big ol big old field out
[1:19:04] there and we pulled a trailer up there

[1:19:08] them got out there and they put the
[1:19:09] music up
[1:19:10] amen we had drive-in services amen but
[1:19:12] you know what we had church
[1:19:15] we had church brother sean said you know
[1:19:17] what if you want to say amen
[1:19:18] just honk your horn sean told me one day
[1:19:21] simply andrew said i've had so many
[1:19:22] amens in all my life
[1:19:25] hey man it's amazing what a person will
[1:19:26] do when they get behind the horn they
[1:19:28] mean l.a man like they never amen before
[1:19:31] heard one preacher say they'll sit out
[1:19:33] there and haunt for an hour and come in
[1:19:34] church and sleep for an hour
[1:19:37] well let's preach anyhow we're here we

[1:19:43] matter we're listen i'm talking about a
[1:19:44] people
[1:19:45] and if you get them in the middle of
[1:19:47] lowe's brother jack and they get with
[1:19:48] another believer and they just begin to
[1:19:50] reminisce about how good god's been to
[1:19:52] him
[1:19:53] and what he's done for him and what he's
[1:19:55] brought them through brother david
[1:19:56] they'll begin to say it's my desire
[1:19:58] amen to serve the lord after all i've
[1:20:01] been through
[1:20:02] i still got joy brother i'll tell you
[1:20:04] what they'll clear the plumbing all out
[1:20:05] in lowe's
[1:20:06] because the holy ghost will come
[1:20:08] wherever he's invited
[1:20:10] and he'll move wherever he's welcome and
[1:20:12] i say this morning church

[1:20:31] from there
[1:20:32] to here today is the same god that's
[1:20:35] gonna take us from here
[1:20:36] into the future home into the millennium
[1:20:39] come on church
[1:20:40] i'm telling you you've not been built by
[1:20:42] a man you've been built by god the
[1:20:46] church
[1:20:46] is not exactly a church building it's a
[1:20:49] it's a church
[1:20:50] it's where the people have gathered see
[1:20:51] the church is not an organization now
[1:20:53] let me see it this way
[1:20:54] through seven successive church ages
[1:20:56] amen god
[1:20:58] has been building a people
[1:21:01] remember i said now we already have the
[1:21:02] stones he said all the way from emphasis
[1:21:04] to layout to see you
[1:21:05] we're only waiting for that headstone
[1:21:09] that the builders rejected 60 i believe
[1:21:11] this is 60
[1:21:12] 62. he said for the builders rejected
[1:21:14] waiting for his coming the captain's
[1:21:16] tone
[1:21:16] then he comes the first seal and says
[1:21:18] the true bride
[1:21:19] will be made up of a thousand times
[1:21:21] thousands see of the people
[1:21:24] but it will be the elect out of every
[1:21:26] age see there must come a true seed
[1:21:28] he's coming forward a word vindicated
[1:21:31] right
[1:21:32] this bride is going to be made up of
[1:21:35] all down through that had the word

[1:25:13] [Applause]
[1:25:16] we're going to be there church ah
[1:25:19] brother andrew i don't know if i'm going
[1:25:20] to make it you're going to make it
[1:25:23] yeah you're going to make it because
[1:25:25] john said being turned i saw seven
[1:25:26] golden candle sticks
[1:25:27] in the midst of the candlesticks was one
[1:25:29] like in the son of man then he comes
[1:25:30] down
[1:25:31] and says the seven stars are the angels
[1:25:33] from seven churches
[1:25:34] see those seven stars were master
[1:25:37] builders
[1:25:39] each age messenger was building by
[1:25:42] christ
[1:25:43] in the star messenger of that age oh i
[1:25:46] ain't got time to slow down here
[1:25:48] but let me just say it this way all
[1:25:49] those messengers stem the tide
[1:25:52] everything they went through they
[1:25:54] weren't swimming downstream
[1:25:56] they were swimming upstream everybody
[1:25:59] else was falling
[1:26:00] for the doctrine of the nicolaitans
[1:26:02] everybody else was worshiping
[1:26:04] that little harlot jezebel amen
[1:26:06] everybody else was
[1:26:07] by the rock amend the name of jesus
[1:26:09] christ they were losing their grace
[1:26:11] they were losing their power to stand
[1:26:13] against that wicked catholicism system
[1:26:16] but there were some men
[1:26:18] [Applause]
[1:26:19] there were some men let me go a step
[1:26:22] further and say there was some elected
[1:26:24] men
[1:26:24] with an elected message that caught an
[1:26:26] elected seed
[1:26:27] and it wasn't just the messenger
[1:26:29] swimming upstream
[1:26:30] it was the entire elected group swimming
[1:26:33] upstream
[1:26:34] because that messenger was going to cap
[1:26:36] that age off
[1:26:37] with a reward
[1:26:40] but the only way he was going to get
[1:26:43] from the beginning of the age
[1:26:44] to the reward was to follow the master
[1:26:47] builder
[1:26:48] ah i'm preaching this morning church and
[1:26:51] let me just go and make the devil mad
[1:26:53] and say if paul was a master builder
[1:26:57] if columba was a master builder if
[1:26:59] wesley was a master builder
[1:27:02] if luther was a master builder then
[1:27:04] there's a young man here this morning
[1:27:06] that's got enough guts to say
[1:27:07] william marion branham was a master
[1:27:10] builder as well
[1:27:13] it may not be popular it may not be
[1:27:16] fancy
[1:27:16] but let me just clean tell the devil
[1:27:18] there are some men in this land today
[1:27:21] that the only way they'll quit preaching
[1:27:23] this message is you have to put a bullet
[1:27:25] in them and kill them
[1:27:26] because it's the reason they're living
[1:27:28] you'll never cap them off
[1:27:30] you'll never set them up it's the
[1:27:32] position of faith
[1:27:33] that is calling out a bride church
[1:27:40] unto the angel amen other church a lot
[1:27:42] of sins right amen can i read that like
[1:27:44] a message believer
[1:27:45] and unto the angel william mary and
[1:27:48] branham
[1:27:49] [Applause]
[1:27:50] write these things oh let me just go
[1:27:52] ahead and put the devil let me put
[1:27:53] another nail in the devil's coffin
[1:27:55] we're not building an organization i'm
[1:27:57] not here building an organization christ
[1:27:59] never sent me to build that
[1:28:00] christ sent me to build individuals to
[1:28:03] the statue of jesus christ
[1:28:05] that they might be the powerhouse
[1:28:08] [Applause]
[1:28:11] oh don't you see why the devil hates
[1:28:13] this church it's because he hadn't been
[1:28:14] able to cut the power off yet
[1:28:19] [Music]
[1:28:20] he's tried sister janet but every time
[1:28:24] there was 150 votes ran in right when he
[1:28:26] got ready to cut your power off
[1:28:28] and the holy ghost electrocuted him and
[1:28:31] knocked him back
[1:28:32] while the manifested sons of god begin
[1:28:34] to raise up holy hands
[1:28:36] begin to lift up their voices because
[1:28:39] you can't cut the power off
[1:28:41] when it's an eternal power
[1:28:45] you can't cut the power off when it's
[1:28:47] not coming from a man
[1:28:49] when it's not coming from a system oh
[1:28:51] come on church
[1:28:53] let me just preach this morning god told
[1:28:55] me one time said you keep on preaching

[1:29:01] stand on a rock
[1:29:02] and preach this message before i
[1:29:04] compromise and let the power
[1:29:07] of our holy ghost be cut off
[1:29:10] and we don't just need preachers with
[1:29:12] that determination
[1:29:14] we need church members that'll say devil
[1:29:17] you ain't cutting my power off
[1:29:22] not gonna cut it off i'll worship in the
[1:29:26] time of trouble
[1:29:27] i'll dance in the rain i'll shout when
[1:29:30] they're laughing at me
[1:29:31] i'll preach when they're ridiculing me
[1:29:36] it's an eternal power church it's coming
[1:29:38] from the holy ghost
[1:29:40] [Applause]
[1:29:43] oh build up the individual that place
[1:29:45] see every building
[1:29:47] has to have a foundation let me say it
[1:29:49] this way there are two foundations

[1:29:53] then there is a foundation which is sand
[1:29:55] let me just preach to you for a second
[1:29:56] isaiah 28 16
[1:30:00] therefore thus saith the lord god

[1:30:32] have you ever just sit and wondered
[1:30:34] why people you used to go to church with
[1:30:36] now call what they used to shout at
[1:30:38] false

[1:30:54] young man do you ever just wonder why
[1:30:55] i'm still hearing this can i tell you

[1:30:58] because isaiah prophesied of you he said
[1:31:01] behold
[1:31:02] i lay in zion
[1:31:05] what is zion the bride
[1:31:09] behold i lay in zion for a foundation

[1:31:20] cornerstone are you ready a sure
[1:31:23] foundation that he that believeth shall
[1:31:26] not make haste

[1:31:30] popularity
[1:31:31] building up on education building up on
[1:31:33] schools building up on political powers

[1:31:51] laodicea let me tell you what the
[1:31:52] prophet said
[1:31:53] they vault of what they have but what
[1:31:55] they have will not stand the test of
[1:31:56] time
[1:31:57] they have built up on quicksand rather
[1:32:00] than the rock of revelation of god's
[1:32:02] word
[1:32:03] see pity them for soon cometh the
[1:32:05] earthquake
[1:32:07] and they'll be gone soon cometh the
[1:32:09] announcement
[1:32:10] peace at last and then send destruction
[1:32:13] and they'll be gone
[1:32:16] but when you build a building you've got
[1:32:18] to put it on the foundation stone
[1:32:20] i'm getting to answer that question for
[1:32:21] you i didn't forget it you build a
[1:32:23] building and paul says
[1:32:25] for other foundation can no man lay them
[1:32:27] that is laid
[1:32:28] which is jesus christ then he comes
[1:32:30] along in ephesians 2
[1:32:31] and says are built upon the foundation
[1:32:35] of the apostles of the prophets jesus
[1:32:38] christ himself
[1:32:39] being the chief cornerstone brother brad
[1:32:41] i love what timothy says
[1:32:43] he says laying it up in store for
[1:32:45] themselves a good foundation
[1:32:47] against the time to come

[1:32:51] a sure foundation against the time to
[1:32:55] come
[1:32:56] that they lay hold on eternal life
[1:32:59] the foundation of god timothy says
[1:33:02] standing
[1:33:03] sure all right then a prophet comes
[1:33:05] along
[1:33:06] and says then a new creation not to the
[1:33:08] nomination but to the word

[1:33:15] was laid in you

[1:35:08] we'll walk through him and one of these
[1:35:10] days if we keep on walking
[1:35:12] our next step will be like enoch
[1:35:19] ah what are you talking about andrew i'm
[1:35:22] talking about
[1:35:23] i'm not talking about perishable
[1:35:25] material
[1:35:27] no i'm i'm going to close this year
[1:35:28] because i can't preach all day but i
[1:35:30] sure feel like it
[1:35:32] i i'm not talking about perishable
[1:35:34] material
[1:35:35] i'm talking about permanent i'm talking
[1:35:38] about permanent mature
[1:35:40] i'm talking about god building seven
[1:35:41] church ages a bride for christ
[1:35:43] i'm talking about a prophet that said we
[1:35:45] know there's going to be a bride
[1:35:47] and there's going to be a wedding supper
[1:35:49] and we know they have the material on
[1:35:50] the earth that's going to make them
[1:35:51] ready they'll be there
[1:35:55] natural carpenter comes to you what
[1:35:56] he'll do he'll tell you how to build
[1:35:57] your natural house
[1:35:59] right spiritual carpenter tells you how
[1:36:02] to build your spiritual house
[1:36:03] and the prophet said i'm going to tell
[1:36:05] you how to make you like himself
[1:36:11] now there are two bodies i'm going to
[1:36:12] tie this up here there are two bodies
[1:36:14] there's the human body then there's the
[1:36:17] spiritual body you realize that
[1:36:18] human body spiritual body you realize
[1:36:21] the human body
[1:36:22] is made up of 16 elements
[1:36:26] calcium petroleum podx cosmic light etc
[1:36:30] the spiritual body is made up of three
[1:36:33] elements
[1:36:35] water blood spirit
[1:36:38] see is what makes his body now do you
[1:36:40] realize the human body
[1:36:42] can only handle so much
[1:36:47] before it begins to break down because
[1:36:50] it's perishable
[1:36:52] it's made out of perishable material you
[1:36:54] say that i don't believe that because
[1:36:55] i'm in the message and i'm
[1:36:57] well let me just preach to you for a
[1:36:58] second because job was smoked with sore
[1:37:00] bulls
[1:37:01] from the soul of his put into his crown
[1:37:03] you realize job's body began to break
[1:37:05] down his mind
[1:37:06] his nerves but it says when god had
[1:37:09] counted you worthy
[1:37:10] when you have a test now don't fail to
[1:37:13] get this when you have a trial or a test
[1:37:15] it shows the grace of god has found you
[1:37:18] favor with god
[1:37:22] god had confidence in job
[1:37:26] he put him to the test he put his trust
[1:37:30] in him
[1:37:30] and he would say though the skin worms
[1:37:32] destroy this body yet in my flesh shall
[1:37:35] i see god
[1:37:35] see job was a part of the spiritual body
[1:37:38] and let me just go and close by saying
[1:37:40] this
[1:37:40] the spiritual body which is the bride
[1:37:43] can handle whatever is thrown at it
[1:37:49] and it will not break down
[1:37:52] [Applause]
[1:37:54] because it's god inspired it's gone and
[1:37:57] constructed
[1:37:58] and it's built by god's instructions see
[1:38:01] this bride is not
[1:38:02] handmade she is spoken word created
[1:38:06] oh this what are you talking about this
[1:38:07] is the formation of the bride
[1:38:09] remember said you're made up of the
[1:38:11] miracle working god i'm talking to you
[1:38:13] now
[1:38:14] amen your material is perfect faith a
[1:38:16] substance faith see do all who go in the
[1:38:18] bride
[1:38:19] have to live within 500 miles of the
[1:38:20] tabernacle i always thought the bride
[1:38:22] would come out of all parts of the world
[1:38:24] at the time of the rapture am i wrong
[1:38:25] no my dear friend you're not but when
[1:38:27] the trumpet of god shall sound
[1:38:29] wherever they are no matter where they
[1:38:31] are see if they're in the jungles of
[1:38:33] africa
[1:38:35] when they buried those martyrs the devil
[1:38:38] said we're done with them they perished
[1:38:39] but no
[1:38:40] he said see you're made up of a
[1:38:42] substance
[1:38:43] that's an unseen made material and god
[1:38:47] will give that substance back
[1:38:51] then when you roll a loved one or you
[1:38:52] roll a church member out
[1:38:54] of this church in a casket and you lay
[1:38:56] him in the graveyard
[1:38:57] and the devil says i finally got rid of
[1:38:59] them no you didn't
[1:39:00] amen they were made of an unseen
[1:39:03] substance
[1:39:04] and the lord himself shall descend from
[1:39:06] heaven
[1:39:07] with a shout and with a voice and with a
[1:39:10] trumpet come on church
[1:39:11] i'm talking about people that were that
[1:39:13] were that were that were done away with
[1:39:14] through the waste of animals
[1:39:16] i'm talking about people that was burned
[1:39:18] in the fire
[1:39:19] but because they were made out of stuff
[1:39:21] that don't bluff

[1:48:15] hang a picture of a prophet of god up in
[1:48:17] a church
[1:48:19] pressure there's a pressure even getting

[1:48:24] pressure but isn't harry mary's here
[1:48:28] today that says i was born to carry this
[1:48:32] i was born to carry this pressure
[1:48:36] brother donny my womb was created to
[1:48:38] carry this message
[1:48:40] just as mary's wound was claimed by the
[1:48:42] spoken word of isaiah you'll bring forth
[1:48:44] the son
[1:48:44] god have mercy and all the pressure she
[1:48:47] went through
[1:48:48] you imagine when she started off walking
[1:48:50] that day to the whale program said she
[1:48:52] went down there and said ange lord
[1:48:53] appeared to her now
[1:48:54] i don't have time to go through all mary
[1:48:56] but i'll see it this way she had
[1:48:57] pressure of people even saying that
[1:48:58] child was born illegitimate
[1:49:00] and joseph had been with another
[1:49:01] man and all kinds of pressures
[1:49:03] all those pressures brother donnie was
[1:49:05] building up to one final pressure
[1:49:07] that right when she was taught to have
[1:49:08] the baby herod said everybody get to
[1:49:10] bethlehem
[1:49:13] you imagine everybody around there
[1:49:14] crying weeping carrying them we gotta we
[1:49:16] got to make a long journey to bethlehem
[1:49:17] and mary nine months pregnant ain't
[1:49:19] crying she's laughing and rejoicing
[1:49:23] joseph had got up with newborn faith
[1:49:24] brother says put her on that mule
[1:49:26] and sit over the hills and through the
[1:49:28] deserts and across the valleys and up
[1:49:30] the mountains they win
[1:49:30] said the worst time at all the woman
[1:49:32] could be on the back of a camel carrying
[1:49:33] a baby
[1:49:34] and then you imagine that passing by and
[1:49:36] saying that's that that's that woman
[1:49:37] that goes up here to happy valley
[1:49:40] that's that woman that believes that
[1:49:42] message right there look at her well
[1:49:43] she's lost her mind i knew it before
[1:49:44] long she would snap
[1:49:46] she's that she's on the back of that
[1:49:48] that camel and she's laughing and
[1:49:49] rejoicing at what she's going through
[1:49:51] and maybe she just hunted over and said

[1:50:41] come through it
[1:50:43] and you're going to stand on the other
[1:50:44] side of it and give glory to god that he
[1:50:46] brought you through it
[1:50:48] brother andrew do you see a vision
[1:50:50] brother do you see a vision or a prophet
[1:50:51] no
[1:50:55] i got the word right here that says and

[1:51:02] and by the word their testimony do you
[1:51:04] love him this morning
[1:51:06] let's buy our hearts together
[1:51:11] he said well andrew it's
[1:51:15] it's really easy to preach these things
[1:51:17] and hear these things
[1:51:19] but it's so hard it's so hard to believe
[1:51:23] that when i'm going through trials it's
[1:51:24] so hard to believe that when i'm going
[1:51:25] through that loss
[1:51:28] it is
[1:51:32] it is but just as paul said the same god
[1:51:35] that give me grace
[1:51:37] we'll give you the grace to get through
[1:51:39] it i was studying the other day and i
[1:51:42] read where
[1:51:42] paul was sitting there getting ready to
[1:51:43] go off the scene and he was instructing
[1:51:45] timothy
[1:51:46] and he told timothy he said timothy hold
[1:51:49] fast
[1:51:50] to the words the form of sound words
[1:51:54] hold fast the form of sound words and i
[1:51:57] just began to thank young timothy
[1:51:58] looking at paul as a veteran soldier as
[1:52:00] a
[1:52:01] as an elder as a as a prophet of god and
[1:52:03] all that he had done for god
[1:52:06] and paul stand there and tell timothy
[1:52:07] timothy hold fast
[1:52:10] i began to think maybe timothy will look
[1:52:13] up at paul and say paul
[1:52:14] how can you tell me that when you're
[1:52:17] getting ready to go off the scene and
[1:52:19] i'm going to go through these things i
[1:52:21] want to go through a loss of a level and
[1:52:23] i want to go through a sickness i'm
[1:52:24] going to go through this
[1:52:26] and it come to me paul could look at him
[1:52:28] and say timothy
[1:52:30] because the same grace that was
[1:52:31] sufficient for me
[1:52:34] will be sufficient for you and i want to
[1:52:37] leave you with this today church
[1:52:39] the same grace that got them through
[1:52:42] the same grace that got william branham
[1:52:44] through taking this message around the
[1:52:46] world seven times in the witch halls of
[1:52:48] india
[1:52:49] in the in the in the the idolatry
