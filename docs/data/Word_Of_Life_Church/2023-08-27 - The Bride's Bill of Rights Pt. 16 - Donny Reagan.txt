be with us if you'd like to September 23rd and 24th which is Saturday night and Sunday morning we'll just come expecting the Lord to speak to us and deal with us and I told them maybe Saturday night they can sing a lot and I tell them maybe he could preach but we're still kind of in that stage he don't want to and I want him to and he wants me to and I don't want to so we're still in the want to and not want to so I guess we'll see who wins out God bless you let's turn to First Peter today if you would chapter 4 verse 12. I'm gonna tell you right now I'm sure you already know it but there are no people like the people of God there are no people on the Earth but the people of God what a privilege it is to be able to rub shoulders with the people of God amen First Peter chapter 4 verse 12. as we just heard that awesome song won't it be a time whenever we get there but we all know there's a lot of hard things to go through before we get there our brother Joel maybe some of you don't know I had another stroke just not too many days ago and just got out of out of rehab this this week and I just want to remember our brother that the Lord will be with him and continue to strengthen him and bring him back for a complete restoration that's what our God does I mean last Sunday morning whenever we had the service and the end of service I was praying for people and just my inspiration spoke and said God could move for diabetes Brother Brad Gilbert was sitting there been dealing with diabetes for several years a blurred vision not been able to see and whenever those words were spoken the Holy Ghost just come over him like a warm feeling he said and the blurred vision left him that's our God Hallelujah today might be your day today might be my daughter Erica today show us how quick the angel of the Lord can come through huh amen I got a call from a young man from his uncle first and then from him and I talked together and the Lord was so dealing with his heart brother Reid balls he here today I think somebody told me that he was here where's he at raise your hand there buddy praise the Lord amen he said he'd been praying talking to the Lord and the Lord had been dealing said I want to be baptized I said well how soon is it as soon as I can so I'll check and see if there's water in the Baptist stream there wasn't no water so I said well we'll go to a creek a lake Pond what do we have to do brother Dave Swanson Missouri at the house with my golf a phone he said you've got a swimming pool over the hill I said oh how come I didn't think of that so I called him back I've cleaned up that swimming pool a lot of times my grandkids I blowed the dust and picked up the leaves and this and that but brother Ken ball told me probably that swimming pool was made for this very purpose right here so we took him down there and baptized him in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah praise the Lord I say when the water's troubled get in God bless you let's read together beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial the word fiery of burning the burning by which metals are roasted and reduced by figure drawn from a Refiner's Fire calamities or trials that test the character beloved thinketh not strains concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice I don't know about you I still need help with that part anybody else need help to be able to rejoice when you're right in the middle of the fire rejoice in as much as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings and this is why that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding Joy but if you be reproached for the name of Christ happy or you for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified and I'd like to be remembered today as we pray have a prayer request in your heart all right let's just go to the Lord Heavenly Father your children as we're gathered here today lord it's such an awesome time here we are in the darkest age the world has ever known our world is groping an insanity our nation is gone politics is gone Lord God we're so grateful that we have a stable place that we can be anchored that's in Christ Jesus we're so thankful today that we've been given this opportunity Lord we're so blessed brother Jewel the church would come to be with us today and the other visitors that are with us now father we come to the breaking of the bread and we're asking that you would come and take the bread and break it may we be when the service is over like those on the way to Emmaus that whenever they had set with you at the table and you broke the bread and then you vanished out of their sight and they knew it was you by the way you broke the bread so may we also know when this service is over that it wasn't a preacher it wasn't a singer it wasn't a musician but once again the Lord Jesus come Among Us and broke the bread in a way that we needed it father you see this prayer calls on my hand today Lord I'm asking your father for this young man that has hurt his shoulder in the name of Jesus May the spirit of God move for him bring complete deliverance Lord I know being the pastor here today there's many sick father viruses bugs all kinds of things that are going around but I pray in the name of Jesus May the sick be healed May those that are bound be delivered may we leave this place today free in Christ Jesus for it's in his name we ask it and the church said amen God bless you you may be seated I've been serving the lord for most of my life as many of you know Carol and I just turned 67 a few weeks back I've been serving him since I was 12. been preaching since I was 18. I preached to many foreign Nations and different tongues have to have interpreters to help you and all that sort of thing different continents of the world that the Lord has helped me to be able to go into but the more I find out about God the more I realize I had a little I do understand and know about him because his ways are so different than our ways how he loves to let his people get in a very difficult spot so that he can come on the scene and be able to move for them we don't always understand how that God will choose to display his greatness sometimes it's open in a Red Sea sometimes it's causing gigantic walls to fall down flat other times he would take hornets and send them Hornets before the armies of God and they would destroy the enemy another time he decided to send Angels down with adjustable wrenches or sockets whichever they used and caused all the chariot wheels to come off of some chariots and they found themselves on the bottom of the sea with no wheels on the Chariots now that's a bad place to find yourself in but the only way he could get Glory out of that situation was that his children had to be on that Red Sea for him to deliver them Shadrach Meshach and Abednego he chose to prove that he had power over the fire but in order to do that he had to let some kids of his be thrown into that furnace that had been heated seven times hotter than it ever had been hit before and God's way of doing that we can find it all through the Old Testament and the new and I'm sure that many of you here today are witnesses that he's done the same thing in your life how many is a witness of that that God will let you get in such a difficult spot and you're wondering Lord what am I doing in this place do you really love me do you really care why am I here which is of course why Peter felt to write this and to phrase it this way beloved think it not a strange thing when you find yourself in such a dilemma that you don't know what to do and you say what am I doing here as a child of God now we tend to think well you know it's only the Sinners it's the unrighteous it's the people that don't love the Lord and serving that find themselves in such calamities but that's not the truth the people of God find themselves in calamities the people of God find themselves many times in such a straight that they actually don't know what to do do and they don't know which way to go and it seems as if though if they look here there's the Red Sea now you know whenever you and I think about God being a mighty General and how that God would lead his people down to the Red Sea and God could have chosen any direction to send them but yet he knew that there was this narrow passage I saw a video of it not long ago on YouTube and they think they found the original place where they come down through there and when you look at it you can see that it's a perfect trap because there's mountains on this side mountains on that side that you cannot Compass there's only a an opening kind of in between those a pass that they could be able to go through before them is the sea behind them is Pharaoh's Army and it looked like that God made a terrible decision that God being this mighty mighty Captain would lead his people in such a position but God had to get them there for it first before he could prove what a deliverer that he was they looked behind them there was Pharaoh's Army they look here there's mountains straight up like this they look to the right Mountain straight up like this in front of them was the Red Sea what's God going to do roll back the Red Sea and let them walk through on dry ground maybe you're sitting here today and your life seems as if though there's mountains all around you and there's no way to go maybe you're so Bound by habits and things of the world and you've tried all sorts of things maybe you've tried to break this habit or that habit and you've tried your best and God knows that you have tried your best and you've Fallen flat on your face and it seems as if though there's no way out but let me sound a trumpet to you today our God is right your present this morning and he's here to move for you now we've not gathered here today that we can see what each one of us wore that's all right but let's move beyond that it's not Easter so nobody has on an Easter bonnet we don't pass out Rabbits and Eggs and all that sort of thing here but we're not here together to look at one another we're not here to try to impress one another I don't know about you I have needs today in the presence of God I'm walking at a place I've never been before if you come to play church today you might as well leave now because you're at the wrong house we've come today because there's folks that need to be healed there's folks that need to be delivered there's folks that need the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's folks that need to be Sanctified by the power of God there's holy ghosts filled people that need a refilling of what they've already got baby there's some here today that needs an old-fashioned stirring of the real baptism of the Holy Ghost anybody going to preach with me today I believe that even though the pressure is against the people of God and the hour is dark we are living in the Most Blessed age that any people could ever live in our God is moving in a mighty way come on somebody and say Amen he's Healing The Sick we've seen him just a few weeks ago raise the dead right back there amen that's the God I'm talking about we're not serving the Creed we're not serving an idol we're not serving a man-made imagination of someone but we are serving him who said I am the same yesterday today and forever I am Alpha I am obika I am the beginning come on Church let's have church today he was Abraham's Mighty God he was Joshua's wall Defender he was Jeremiah's help in the time of trouble he was a he kills wheel in the middle of the wheel he was John the Baptist's answer to prophecy he was habakkuk's desire to the nation he was or Hallelujah he was the mighty one that appeared Oh Glory to God when Abraham did not know which way to go when Moses was on the back side of the desert and he needed an answer he was the I am that I am that appeared in the burning bush well let me tell you today he's not only a god of history but he was my god when I needed a savior he was my god when I needed a greater understanding of the godhead he was my God whenever I was so low come on children has he been your God to heal you I said then your God to save you has he been your God not only that he's fixing to be our God which is going to take us out of this world in [Applause] the same one that saved me the same one that healed me is fixing to be the same one that's going to change us hallelujah hallelujah him those crucial hours that's when he loves to prove himself Prophet said it this way and those crucial crucifying hours listen to those words crucial crucifying hours oh my God that we see the resurrection it's in that time that when God loves to display his grace I mean he loves to see him do it but how many wants to help him do it ah now what happened dogs y'all hands it quit working and they're wonderful but when you're God restores a person God heals and God delivers and God brings them out of a fiery furnace but the problem of it is none of us want to be that person goes in the furnace no brother Isaiah do it let brother let somebody else in I'll Rejoice with them no sometimes God a trial and he's got your name wrote All Over [Applause] imagine our sister several years ago whenever the doctor gave her a diagnosis of cancer it was not the report she wanted to hear little did she know right says little did she know that God was going to use her she found favor in his sight you see God cannot trust everybody that way God cannot let terrible things happen to some children because they're babies they ain't growed up but I believe God's got some people that are mature Christians and he will let all hell come against them because he's got confidence in them he has been fellowshipping with them and he knows they believe in when things are good they believe in when things are bad they trust him when they got money in the bank they trust him and they ain't even got no bank they trust him whenever things are really good weather and they trust him when the wind is blowing when the wind is howling and they don't know what to do but God tells the devil I've got a daughter down there in Louisiana I've got who's going to tell her that is pretty bad it's cancer it's just a night and the other and they ain't much hope but what did our god do he come Hallelujah is a mighty rushing powerful God and brought complete deliverance to our sister here she sets among us today healed by the power of God I say for y'all to praise the Lord for doing such hallelujah amen I can't wait till I can stand here and give a testimony to my own daughter when the doctor say there's not much more they can do they want to Nashville this week and the doctor didn't have a good report but I'm glad I'm not looking to what the doctor says I'm not look into what a scan says I'm not looking to an MRI or a pet scan I'm looking to Jehovah God and his word and he said I am the Lord that healeth thee of all thy diseases [Applause] look at the difference one of many between me and God I would never let my daughter have cancer I would never let my daughter have cancer in her liver then I would never let it pass to her brain never but that shows what I know there's going to be somebody that's going to testify that God can save somebody that's lost that God can redeem somebody that sings past Redemption that God can heal somebody of brain cancer that God can heal somebody of liver cancer that God can restore somebody that's had a terrible stroke and the doctor says well that's the best you can have well that might be the best they say you can have but we believe there's another report and what is Hallelujah I hear strikes you I already healed mother sure in the name of Jesus that's what we choose to believe [Applause] notice this in those crucial hours that process to those sacred Sands sacred Sands what a what a powerful word two words together sacred Sands and what gives us there we don't shout our way over we shout away out but they don't shout our way here we call we're thrown inward you know however he can get us there in those crucial hours that press us on those sacred Sands it was in the Bible remember no matter how great the distress is Satan I'm on all hell listen to me today Satan cannot take your life until God has finished with you now the Devil May threaten you I'm going to do this and that and the other don't you listen to that liar because that's exactly what it is he didn't bring you on the earth he didn't give you life and he cannot take your life I tell almighty God is done with you somebody to say Amen how many knows that our life is brought here as brother Benton just said we were born to serve God I was born to torn in hell I was born to make nervous Devils nervous I was born to cast out Devils I was born to baptize I was born to preach I was born to lay hands on people I watched the Lord God straighten out their crossed eyes this I was born for this I will do this you were born for to serve almighty God and this we will do [Applause] Satan cannot take your life until God has finished with you listen this there is nothing can happen to you unless God permits it there is no evil that can come unless God permits it and it's for your good it's some of those good things I don't really enjoy you know what I mean it's for your good he's working that so you mean even when bad things and evil things will come upon us or come upon our family or upon our church or whatever more that God permitted that yes now God never done it but he allowed it when the enemy will say I'll do this and that and God said you won't do it you won't do it well let me add him go ahead but before you do it I'll tell you right now that's my daughter that's my son they believe me they will trust me take everything job had go ahead Smite him Smite his children let his wife turn against him but God had been fellowshipping with job and God testified to the devil and said I've got a man down there there ain't Nobody Like Him in all the earth and the devil said why sure you pet him and you baby him around God said no you go ahead and touch his life but you cannot be able to do this and that and God put boundaries on him so has he done for you and I he might try you he might test you but don't you worry he's like a dog on a chain he might jump and lunge at you and slobber at the mouth but he's got to end to that chain that's what I'm waiting for it's the end of the chain and the devil jumps and jerks so hard he chokes himself to death [Applause] amen this is our right as the pride of Christ to rule and reign with Jesus but we must have a character that will match his sad part about it is we wasn't born with that I'm gonna go ahead and describe you every one of your born Hogs lost blind wretched to suck me even that you got saved you still didn't have a good character but God wants a people with character that's going to be molded listen to this before Abraham could see Elohim there had to be 25 years of testing before the Hebrew children could see the Son of God they had to go into a fiery furnace I want you to notice now how the Cadence of this runs before the great supernatural phenomena happens something devastating will happen first before a great great miraculous Supernatural power of God can come I'm not looking for sickness I don't think any of you are but before healing can ever be made manifest somebody's gonna have to fight sickness before that can ever be diseases that are healed come on somebody people of God are going to have to wrestle them but we will only wrestle them for a season you'll imagine the blind man in John chapter 9 whenever the disciples come to Jesus and said who sin this man or his parents and Jesus said neither but the glory of God might be made manifest wonder how many Summers that oh God missed with his family I wonder how ashamed he was sitting there begging I wonder how much reproach was brought upon him he didn't even realize until that very day it was all for the glory of God some of you no doubt have suffered you went through such difficult in your life and you're thinking God don't you like me God have I done something that you don't love me the way you love others he's got to have somebody that he can try he's got to have somebody that he can test he's got to have somebody that he can face hell and he will stand there beside them and say Satan back off back off that's my son that's my daughter you can't go any farther stop here Gloria before Daniel could see an angel he had to go into the lines then before job could ever see the resurrection he had to go in and lose everything he had but then by vision notice let us get off the ash heat today with a new vision with a new power with a new determination that we see God in his power we see the resurrection of things coming how many wants to leave this ice sheep I'll tell you sometimes I get tired of piled up on the ass sheep don't you it's all hot and dry my there's dust everywhere in memories of this and memories of that I think we need to rise some of us and Shake ourselves off and say I'm sick and tired of this is he now he'll Stripes I'm Healed I've been waiting on God waiting on God waiting on God I'm going to rise up and I'm going to act like I'm already healed I'm going to go ahead and say by his type I'm already delivered I'm already free and the Devil is a loser and I am a winner [Applause] hello oh God help us it taken a Gethsemane of drops of blood breaking through his skin it taken a cruel Agony of Calvary before there could come the proof of an eternal God who could raise the Dead it taken a Gethsemane and a Calvary to make an Easter would we ever make that equation would we ever put them two things together to produce an Easter a Gethsemane look at this a Gethsemane and a Calvary so one Gethsemane on one Calvary one plus one equals a resurrection well they won't teach you that Maps will they won't teach you that in church theology but this is God's mathematics so one Gethsemane and one Calvary and the devil saw one Gethsemane one Calvary it means total extermination this is the only way they can be saved there's no way if I can kill him he's totally wiped out oh but I'd love to been down there close to the regions of the lost that day whenever they saw him as he died there on the cross my God my God wives all forsaken me and the devil must have no doubted hell kicked back in his recliner and all the Devils come back down and said oh devil we got him now he's the only one that we ever saw walk on water he's the only one that we ever saw do them Miracles and now we have killed him the kingdom and yours forever thank you so on the door keeping demons went to the door yes is Satan home he is who may I say is calling the first and the last the alpha the Omega let me get all glory to God the beginning at the end Hallelujah tell your boss he's got a guest hmm you imagine he walks up and said ah you arrived did you yes my blood is still hot on Calvary I thought I got you when I killed Moses I thought I got you when I got the firstborn down in Egypt and he goes on and on and on he said but you never but now I'm here well now I've killed you now I've taken your power and Jesus reaches over and grabs the keys off of his side and he turns around and keeps the door of hell and the prophet said he kicked it so hard he shook everything in hell off the walls and as you know the Devil in him got the keys to his own house [Applause] now right next door to Hell later region called Paradise so it goes over there maybe Abraham comes at the door oh my God Sarah it's the same one that come down to our tenth that day you remember that one that told you what you were seeking it's him and Ezekiel said who is it who is it he's trying to jump over the people who is it oh no oh no it's that man I saw in the middle of the wheel that wheel in the middle of the wheel what did he do he come down to set them free I believe he's right here this morning in Word of Life Church to set you free from last from line from adultery whatever it is that's got you bound one Gethsemane one Calvary equaled Abraham's freedom Hallelujah he was beaten so you could be healed why would you let the devil rob you he was beaten so you could put that alcohol them drugs that adultery under your feet forever you'll never do it by drawing out of church you'll never do it by shaking hands with a preacher but you've got to meet the resurrection himself and the Resurrection comes inside of you oh glory and then you have one Gethsemane and one Calvary and that will produce your Resurrection [Music] see it takes a crucifixion takes a crushing of the flower to bring perfume from it it takes a crushing of a life to get the best out of it that there is Lord help us that's the reason Jesus had to be crushed to bring forth what he was listen to his friend which is just really concentrate on this he could not stand before the crucifixion and say all power in heavens and earth is given unto me you don't find you're saying that before he died he could only say it oh blessed be the Lord God I mean if you have went through terrible trials and you go yeah praise the Lord I know brother so-and-so is delivered to this and delivered that but you couldn't really say it for yourself now look at my life brother Tim Pruitt there's a few others that I know of I never smoked I never drank I never done any of that never was out there in the world and done what many of you have by the grace of God it took just as much of the mercy of God the blood of Jesus the Same is it did you so what if everybody come at me brother tell them the same way letting out there in the world never drunk never cuss never lied never done any of those things that yet come to the lord of the very very early age and what if every one of the children of God let me gather around in heaven and every one of us will say well Lord we never drunk we never smoked we never got out there on the World to talk who was going to testify that God can reach down to the lowest tale somebody here today somebody here today some of you that's dreaming our service you'll be able to stand before the Lord Jesus and give a testimony that I cannot give come on somebody I know he can deliver alcoholics because I prayed for many of them I know he can deliver drug addicts because I prayed for many of them I know he can be able to do these things but I don't know it personally the way some of you know it but some of you could say glory to God I was an alcoholic I smoked cigarettes I done this so now to the other but today I am free I [Applause] it's free indeed it will be your testimony and yours and yours and yours mingled in was mine that will have every devil blanketed out there won't be one left that will not have been conquered [Music] [Applause] he could have spoke all of his attributes into existence before he ever made a world let there be let there be let there be let there be we would have gathered around his throne and we would have worshiped and adored oh great Adonai Jehovah Jehovah Elohim women of worship and praised and adored and he could have said I'm a redeemer but of course known if you were lost I'm a Healer but none of you were ever sick I'm a deliverer but none of you were ever bound and we would have taken his word for it but he didn't want it to be that way you imagine When We Gather those that have lived down through all the ages glory to God when we go to testify maybe a beginning with one of you brothers and sister back up Lord can I testify Papa I was lost and you saved me uh maybe that little woman at the well will jump up and jump him and say Jesus you remember meeting me I'm at Samaritan woman that's aware I do remember you daughter I did remember you yes yes yes you went in and set the city on fire because I set you on fire I do remember you you've been married all those times and you've done this or that she just like to stand up she'll imagine she's going to be one emotional sister in the paradise when you she's going to be one sister that we're gonna have a hard time setting down because she was a person that nobody would have nothing to do with everybody wrote her off all the church didn't want nothing to do whether but Jesus went out of his way to get a hold of this woman why because her name was on the Lamb's Book of Life and there was not enough devils in hell to keep in the Lord Jesus from going to her yeah Oh Glory to God after the crucifixion he could stand and say all powers in Heaven and Earth is given unto me but what did it do it taken crucifixion first it taken the question and the disappointing of the Apostles when they'd seen their savior the one they loved and seen him raised from the dead from the grave I watched the prophets he relates his own experience when I lost my baby my little Sharon and that was one thing that stumbled me I said how can that be for good maybe some of you said to you today and you've lost a child or a husband or a wife or a loved one and you say how can that be for my good my heart is broken I'll never be the same how can that be a few months later when I seen her standing in all the beauty of a young girl speaking to me China by the side of that Old Wagon broken down and I know if she would have lived she might have turned out wrong God had to take her while she was tender and sweet I know I'll see you again I know I shall see her and I Know It Beyond any shadow of a doubt I think of my wife of 22 years old taking merely a girl a little mother when the paper's given the headline young mother of a reverend just died how my heart bled I didn't know what to do but today I know it was all working for my good I know the life had to be ground and twisted and squeezed to get what was in it out or am I glad God squeezed him well I'm not glad for the pain he had to go sir I'm not glad for the pain that Paul had to go through but am I glad brother Jolie was able to be squeezed out I would not have Romans first and second Corinthians Philippians Ephesians Galatians Philemon I would not have all of these books to read brother Harvey we would not have all this encouragement had God not had men of God that he could squeeze and pressure him all my but he had confidence in them you say how can you say that because he knew them before the foundation of the world as he told Jeremiah before you was ever formed in your mother's womb I ordained you a prophet to the Nations oh my God watch how he relates this to himself into us there was too much of you in you know what the paragraph about this there was too much Branham in there that had to be squeezed out before God could make himself known there was too much of you in you wow so you mean your wife is not your greatest enemy after all I mean it's not your brother it's not your husband it's not you you know your next door neighbor you mean your greatest enemy is actually you and you oh that's a hard one isn't it that's a hard thing to separate me out of me praise the Lord and notice the way he says that there's too much of you and you too God had to squeeze it out through blessings and oh my giving you over abundance of money and just making you so rich and making how we wish God had to squeeze it out through trials and while that squeezing was coming on it's but after a while the sky's clear back and you see the purpose of God then you cry notice then you cry I know my redeemer liveth and at the last days he'll stand on the earth and though the skin worm destroys this body yet in my flesh shall I see God these little trials and things are just for a moment and they fade and pass away they're only done for our good lest remember that that God would get Glory come with me to Romans chapter 8 verse 17. Paul introduces a very strange thing it has been called the hurts and the hallelujahs the hurts and the hallelujahs and if children then heirs Heirs of God John Heirs of Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together notice Romans 8 17 introduces us to two important biblical ideas suffering and Glory suffering and Glory or the hurts and the hallelujahs this verse begins appropriately with the glory of course and if children then heirs oh my who wouldn't want to be told that if children then Heirs of God and John else with Jesus Christ boy don't God know how to be able to get our attention he'll go to babying us and Hallelujah honey I love you so much and you just my little young and you're my little boy and my little girl I died for you and I love you and then he let you have it if children then heirs Heirs of God John heirsth Christ if so be we suffer with it now notice what he done he put the Hallelujah first and then he put the hurt right in the middle of it and scrunched it together don't worry he hallelujahizes the rest of the end of the verse here because he knows we need it most of us need two hallelujahs for every one trial that we go through sometimes depends on the length of the trial when matinee 200 hallelujahs but the Lord knows exactly what we need and the church said if children than Heirs of God in John heirs says Christ if so be that we suffer with him watching he just stays in there for just a little bit brother Levi just a little bit if we suffer with him now we go back to the Hallelujah that we may also be glorified the governor of saints say oh thank you Jesus thank you Jesus we say all Heirs of God amen Amen brother now you're talking my language Heirs of God and showing Heirs of God yes sir that's me until we come to that part if so be that we are heirs that we suffer Ed much so he said that if you're getting Revelation on this today it'll help you enjoy my sermon even better you see the first profound statement we're children of God and heirs wow heirs you know like John Paul Getty was your uncle or something you know the Amazon guy you found out that she was just relate to him and he's going to go ahead and give you part of his inheritance now one of the greatest richest men in all the world that's a lie I'm way richer than the Amazon Bezos guy my goodness I've got eternal life I've got peace I've got joy I've got happiness that man ain't got nothing but a bunch of kingdom and an animal is a Amazon Kingdom of that which ain't gonna last very much longer know how because the end of all things is at hand when there ain't no more Jeff Bezos I still will be when there is no more devil you still will be when there is no more sickness you still will be brother sister Verse 18 for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US you see the weight of the Saints cross is not even comparable to the glory they'll have what's that day it can seem so heavy now and so difficult you see even creation is groaning for the freedom from sin already we can look around in our beautiful hills and mountains here of Tennessee just this week I've noticed a sugar maple on a street in our subdivision just this week it has changed from such a beautiful green now a red is already coming for us before you know it but look around in the yellows and the oranges and the Reds and the trees then before you know it there won't be none we'll look across the mountain some and say what happened to it the glory is but a fading moment and it's gone we enjoy him for several months during the summer how beautiful they are and people come to Gatlinburg they come to Pigeon Forge they come from everywhere to see what the Turning of the color of the leaves that you and I know it's a sign of death it won't be too much longer there won't be no leaves left they'll be totally gone that's the seasons of our life we go through those times and everything is so green and so beautiful and then all of a sudden the leaf will turn or you imagine how brother Jewel felt the other day just on Sundays brother Isaiah was telling me and that out to the service and this stroke hit by the Jewel and they thought he was kind of sweet but he wasn't asleep such a Vanessa come up and there was a nurse there at the restaurant where they were thank God they were and then another one come up and they were able to rush him to the hospital and able to be able to move for our brother don't we thank God for that today do you think he wanted that to happen to him but I believe our God has a greater phase of Glory that he wants to reveal and how does he reveal it to the fading of the leaves through the tests and the trials of life second Timothy chapter 2 verse 12. if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him he also will deny us oh children we don't want to deny him do it we will reign with him if we watch jump shout dance I believe in all that you'll never find one scripture identifying those who reign with Christ as being those who jump or shout or even speak with tongues and yet we believe in all of the above but the identification is always the same suffering persecution difficult submitting your life to God and say God here I am if God was handing out the gift of Miracles In The Word of Life church today how many would want it speaking in tongues signs wonders how many preachers would want it ain't none of you raising your hands because you ain't been honest but if God was handing out diverse kinds of tongues and miracles and all kinds of things how many of us would want it the majority of us would but if God said I need somebody but I can prove I'm a Healer of cancer God said I need somebody that I can prove I can stop a heart attack God can say I need somebody that I can straighten out cross eyes you wouldn't find me the first in line with that I like mine the way they are they ain't pretty but they're mine I wouldn't want I wouldn't volunteer for cancer I wouldn't volunteer none of my church folks I certainly wasn't volunteer none of my family so God knows better than to ask any of us such because most of us would say I'm going to the back of the line Lord I thought she meant Miracles I didn't realize you meant I was going to be the recipient of one I thought you meant I was going to be the one to do it so God looks down and says ah you what if I let you fight a battle diabetes are you strong enough and you're praying you cry and you're praying and you say but my God is going to deliver me and you go to meetings and other people get healed when you come back still on your insulin and the devil say yeah yeah uh-huh see there it ain't it ain't happening for you and you just might as well remind him all you gotta do sister say one word yet yet it ain't happened yet but it's going to I said it ain't happened yet but it's going to well praise the Lord maybe you're here today he said well I've been prayed for and I've been prayed for and it ain't come I had one more word it ain't come yet but I'm waiting for it I don't know when the angel of the Lord's coming to my neighborhood but I believe he's fixing to pass through Hallelujah I don't know when he's going to do it but I'm waiting on him Lord I'm on your hands [Applause] notice in Revelation chapter 5 verse 10 and we'll close your shortly the voice of the Overcomers and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the Earth notice this in the church age book he redeemed us for a purpose he bought us for a purpose we are Kings spiritual Kings we're going listen we're going to be Kings upon the Earth with him when he sits on his throne but now We Are Spiritual Kings and we Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom praise the Lord I believe there's some Sons and Daughters of God sitting in this building today that are already enjoying reigning with the Lord Jesus why because sin which one time had you bound today is under your feet tempered that you thought Lord have mercy in my family every one of them may goth office him forever was but the grace of God come and now that temper is under your feet maybe a sexual passion and whatever more has just about discharge your entire family and you think Lord help me dear God it runs in my family I can see my uncles I can see my aunts I can see my grandma I can see my grandpa it you need to be identified with another family tree you need to be identified with the family tree of life and you need to say no devil you're not destroying me with lust you're not destroying me with lying I am a son or daughter of God I am already reigning with Jesus Christ in a spiritual Kingdom on this Earth you're under my feet oh Hallelujah Hallelujah notices we are already raining it says for by one man's death excuse me the deaths reigned by what much more they which receive abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by why Christ Jesus oh think the spirit of God living in our souls helping us to overcome what we thought was impossible helping us to live the kind of life that the Lord Jesus is not ashamed to call you Brothers hmm all right sir Inspire it Revelation 20 and 6 blessed is Holy he that has part in the First Resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him Thousand Years Hallelujah every one of you today think nobody knows you like you you know your UPS or Downs your weaknesses your failings I believe the Lord Jesus desires to bring us to a place of victory well we can have a Victorious walk and it's not by our own life of course in our own power but it's his power that lives inside of us praise the Lord as a matter of fact brother Tim Pratt sent me a quote this morning it's just absolutely wonderful he said that a person can become so full of God's presence and living in the presence of God and you become drunk on the Holy Ghost you're drunk every day for the rest of your life the rest of your life you're so drunk on the presence of God I began to think about that and I thought you know Lord the truth of it is I guess everybody in this age is drunk on something it's easy to see a lot of folks are drunk on politics some are drunk on religion some are drunk on money some are drunk on this and Heather so if I'm gonna have to be drunk on something I choose the Holy Ghost as my brands what about you to be so intoxicated was the word that the prophet used so intoxicated you get up intoxicated you go to bed intoxicated you're so drunk oh and then I found another statement where it said in Shreveport that he said May the presence of the Holy Ghost come in this building today in such a way that will become so drunk on the holy ghost that we forget what our name is why now wouldn't that be a drunk Bunch we don't even know who we are we just so lose sight of the things that are around us oh praise the Lord praise the Lord thank you Father thank you Father how many love to be remembered today is we're gonna pray for you just raise your hand to God maybe
