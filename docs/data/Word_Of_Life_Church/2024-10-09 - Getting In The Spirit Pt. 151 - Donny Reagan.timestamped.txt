[24:40] over in North Carolina our home Church
[24:43] there with brother Josh minut pastors
[24:45] and the Lord blessed me uh not working
[24:48] this week so I was able to come over and
[24:50] help with the relief effort and I I
[24:51] really commend what's being done here um
[24:55] I think of when Esther was
[24:59] was there uh as a queen and her her
[25:03] people were in Peril and I believe it

[25:08] such a time as
[25:10] this and in that time of Crisis her true
[25:14] identity was
[25:15] revealed and her people were saved and I
[25:18] believe this is the hour when the bride
[25:20] of Christ our true identity is being
[25:22] made known and we're not just a queen
[25:25] sitting on the throne to look pretty but
[25:26] we're we're here to serve amen and so

[31:58] [Music]
[32:08] [Applause]
[32:11] praise the Lord let's Stand
[32:16] Together isn't it an honor to be able to
[32:18] gather together Amen on a Wednesday
[32:21] night to be able to come to the house of
[32:23] God
[32:24] and hear the word sing share testimonies
[32:29] of What the Lord Has Done and just it's
[32:32] just a Wonder to go to church I love to
[32:34] be in the house of God I'm kind of
[32:37] strange I generally keep my time
[32:40] schedule and everything by church right
[32:43] so when I don't go to church on
[32:44] Wednesday or Sunday if you're gone
[32:45] somewhere you know it messes up my whole
[32:47] week I don't even what day of the week
[32:49] it is I know a lot of people would think
[32:51] that is so strange and peculiar I
[32:54] considered an honor actually that I I I
[32:57] judge my week and where I'm at in the
[32:59] week by being able to assemble together
[33:02] with the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ
[33:05] it's a great honor isn't it
[33:08] amen Let's uh turn to Jeremiah chapter
[33:11] 5 now the last time I preached on the
[33:13] lad rain best I remember is about two
[33:15] weeks ago on Wednesday night little did
[33:18] we know we was going to have office
[33:20] floods and everything going on so I hope
[33:22] everybody ain't going to leave tonight
[33:24] cuz I'm going to preach on latter of
[33:25] rain again tonight so
[33:28] but part of what I told you two
[33:30] Wednesday nights ago is already coming
[33:32] to pass out here in our grounds y'all
[33:35] seen this grass how it's coming up and
[33:37] all of its beautiful green and all that
[33:40] that's exactly the way we want the Lord
[33:42] to do our lives with the latter reign of
[33:45] the Holy
[33:46] Ghost Jeremiah 5 verse 24 neither say
[33:51] they in their heart let us now fear the
[33:54] lord Our God that give us rain both both
[33:58] the former and the latter in his season
[34:02] he reserve unto us the appointed weeks
[34:08] of the Harvest so it's God that
[34:10] determines the sewing time the planting
[34:12] time and also the reaping time Hosea 6:3
[34:16] then shall we know if we follow on to
[34:20] know the Lord then shall we know if we
[34:23] follow on to know the Lord his going
[34:26] forth is prepared
[34:28] as the morning and he shall come unto us
[34:33] as the rain so we don't want just a move
[34:37] of God we want
[34:40] God a God that's who we want and he
[34:44] shall come unto us as the rain as the
[34:47] latter and
[34:48] former Reign unto the Earth Joel 2: 23
[34:55] be glad then you children of Zion and
[34:57] rejoice and the Lord your God for he
[34:59] hath given you the former Reign now
[35:03] notice the intensity of the former Reign
[35:06] moderately he has given you the former
[35:08] Reign moderately and he will cause to
[35:11] come down for you the rain the former
[35:16] rain and the latter rain in the first
[35:21] month so prophetically there will come a
[35:23] time now you notice the prophecy of Joel
[35:25] is a little bit different than Jeremiah
[35:27] and Hosea that there will come a time
[35:30] whenever there will be both the former
[35:33] and the latter falling at the same time
[35:37] what is former moay teaching rank so at
[35:41] the end time which is the time we're
[35:42] living right now it will come forth both
[35:46] rains will come in the exact same season
[35:49] we're in a special time amen amen we're
[35:53] going to pray how many like to be
[35:54] remembered tonight got a need request on
[35:56] your heart also I was contacted by a
[35:59] friend of mine and also uh some brothers
[36:01] here in the church brother JJ Selena him
[36:03] and his wife had a newborn baby and
[36:05] they've had to take that baby to the
[36:07] hospital he having some type of seizures
[36:09] and not very old at all and they wanted
[36:11] us to to pray for him um I certainly
[36:14] want you to continue to pray for all of
[36:17] those that have been affected by this
[36:18] flood in our region and I'm sure that
[36:21] you know another hurricane hurricane
[36:22] Milton is heading toward Florida tonight
[36:26] and they're saying could possibly be the
[36:28] worst one that they've had 103 years
[36:31] something like that since ju is H Tampa
[36:33] area and they're just not sure exactly
[36:35] of course what he's going to do we
[36:36] believe God can still move in the storms
[36:38] are been on also I'd like for you if you
[36:41] would to remember all of those that are
[36:44] volunteering and coming over and helping

[36:49] coming day in and day out and again as
[36:52] your pastor I I just I just admonish you
[36:55] don't don't get over overwhelmed with
[36:58] all this if you need a break take a
[37:00] break if you need to trade out with
[37:02] somebody um you know the subconscious is
[37:05] able to take things in and sometimes the
[37:07] first conscience is not always aware of
[37:10] what's going on and we go to building up
[37:12] in our spirit and loading up in our
[37:14] subconscious and we don't even realize
[37:16] what we're doing and then we feel
[37:17] ourselves so despondent and in such
[37:20] Despair and we're kind of figure out
[37:21] what in the world it is so just just
[37:23] just be careful if you need to take a
[37:25] break from what you're doing um for the
[37:27] for those of you that have not been in
[37:28] some of these um these areas it's just
[37:31] unbelievable I've been U couple of days
[37:34] this week and it's just it's just
[37:36] catastrophic it's just more than you can
[37:39] describe um cameras video cameras don't
[37:43] do it any justice at all a human being
[37:45] is not made to take but so much
[37:49] catastrophe and crisis so please some of
[37:53] you are giving some of you are coming
[37:55] and working and we so appreciate that
[37:57] cuz we couldn't do it without the
[37:58] response of all the people but please
[38:00] don't remember those that are coming
[38:02] over and some of our brothers has taking
[38:04] off work and they're going every day to
[38:07] deliver all this wouldn't do us any good
[38:09] have all these Goods over here if we
[38:11] didn't have a way to be able to get it
[38:12] out to the people so pray for them and
[38:15] the sisters are here and I mean it's
[38:17] just it's just awesome what's going on
[38:18] and we're we're so grateful for it so
[38:20] would you please remember them as
[38:23] well Lord Jesus we count it such an
[38:25] honor that we would be able to gather
[38:28] here Lord once again I think of my
[38:31] brothers and sisters in communist
[38:33] China I remember when I've been there
[38:37] before and just a knock on the door in
[38:40] the hotel room it's totally different
[38:43] than the feeling that you get here
[38:45] because not knowing that they're coming
[38:47] to get you to throw you in jail and then
[38:50] Lord thinking of Vietnam other places
[38:54] where we have actually helped Brothers
[38:57] rent tourist Vans and little did they
[39:00] know the tour guide was a
[39:04] preacher and there was people interested
[39:06] in the message and they would go around
[39:09] in these communist places and they would
[39:12] be preaching the message of the hour
[39:14] under the opes of a tour God of course
[39:18] really ever Holy Ghost fil man is a tour
[39:22] guide he takes us through the historical
[39:24] sites of the scripture he takes us
[39:27] through the the present sites and he
[39:29] points us to the Future
[39:31] ones so Lord we count it such a great
[39:34] honor that we could gather here while
[39:36] freedom is still in our nation we could
[39:38] come here tonight and worship and sing
[39:40] and pray and we don't ever want to take
[39:43] that for granted Lord you see our needs
[39:45] father would you be mindful of us God I
[39:48] pray for brother JJ and his wife little
[39:50] baby father the little child can't
[39:52] believe for itself but we're asking you
[39:54] tonight as the people of God lord be
[39:57] mindful of our our friends dear friends
[40:01] Lord down in Florida several churches in
[40:03] that area brother Danny Steven and his
[40:04] church all gathered together tonight in
[40:07] their Church Father just waiting and
[40:09] praying God be merciful to them would
[40:11] you Lord May the spirit of God have
[40:14] mercy on them Father then Lord we think
[40:16] of all this territory here in our own
[40:18] country Lord we thank brother Jeff snog
[40:21] been with us tonight brought different
[40:23] things down to distribute it's just
[40:25] absolutely overwhelming Lord the love of
[40:28] God on the people of God's hearts all
[40:30] that's that's happening father help us I
[40:32] pray I pray for everyone Lord that's
[40:35] coming here some of these mothers
[40:37] bringing their children and bringing
[40:39] their schoolwork and Lord grandmothers
[40:41] coming and babysitting with their
[40:43] grandchildren while the mothers can be
[40:45] able to sort out the food and then the
[40:46] brothers taking it out Lord me seeing
[40:50] some of the places where they've been
[40:51] and treacherous roads where they're
[40:53] driving I pray you'd watch over every
[40:55] one of them Father would you bless them
[40:57] Lord Lord Jesus now we come to the
[41:00] breaking forth of your word help me that
[41:02] I can get out of the way Lord speak to
[41:05] us tonight the words of Life In The Name
[41:08] Of The Lord Jesus Christ we ask it and
[41:10] the church said amen amen God bless you
[41:13] you may be
[41:18] seated we certainly know that the
[41:22] Harvest that we're looking to in this
[41:25] last day well all depends on the type of
[41:30] seed that have been sewn in the ground
[41:34] now we know that of course from the
[41:35] natural sense of looking around and
[41:37] seeing that living in the Harvest time
[41:41] now October here in this part of the
[41:44] part of the earth a lot of the farmers
[41:46] that have uh already cut their corn for
[41:49] silage one right down the road here and
[41:51] I saw them a week or so ago as they was
[41:53] making one pass after another dug out a
[41:56] big place in the ground ground there
[41:58] they would shovel it over into their
[41:59] wagon come and dump it out it'll lay
[42:02] there during the cold winter months and
[42:04] they will take the tarp off of it as
[42:06] they need it spread it out to their
[42:08] cattle other farmers are going around
[42:11] with the second some of them the third
[42:13] cut of hay others are cutting their corn
[42:17] they're shelling it others are doing
[42:19] different things driving in different
[42:21] parts of the country down through South
[42:23] Carolina the other day and seeing
[42:25] soybeans that was
[42:27] a harvested cotton that was still there
[42:30] and not yet fully harvested so looking
[42:32] at it in the natural we can see that
[42:34] we're in a harvest time even in the
[42:37] season where we live how much more
[42:40] spiritually are we in the Harvest Time
[42:43] which is the end time now God has had
[42:45] many different different Harvest Cycles
[42:48] it was in the days of Enoch was in the
[42:51] days of Noah was in different time
[42:53] frames of course dispensation and we
[42:56] know that God at the the end of every
[42:58] Church age God would send a messenger
[43:01] that messenger would come and rebuke
[43:04] that former Church age and he would tell
[43:07] them where they was wrong try to lead
[43:09] them back to repentance for the most
[43:11] part it was too late for many of them
[43:13] but he would come with a message that
[43:16] would be able to be able to bring
[43:18] something in the hearts of the elect of
[43:20] God at it was adding to the mystical
[43:24] body that God had been forming and now
[43:27] we believe that we are at the very end
[43:30] of this Harvest cycle of the Gentiles so
[43:34] what are we dealing with in the hour
[43:38] that we're in now we can look around and
[43:40] we can see all types of different
[43:43] churches and we've seen many of them as
[43:45] we've been going out and helping and I
[43:47] thank God for absolutely every one of
[43:50] them we went to a Pentecostal church
[43:52] today we went to a Presbyterian church
[43:54] today we pass Baptist Church we've
[43:57] passed all kinds of churches and they're
[43:59] opening their buildings to be able to
[44:01] receive Food you know all types of
[44:04] things to help the people of their
[44:06] Community I appreciate every one of them
[44:09] don't you and you realize that some of
[44:12] them are actually doing their Community
[44:15] a greater service now than they've done
[44:18] for the type of spiritual food that
[44:20] they've handed out for the past 50 years
[44:23] because they're handing them out bread
[44:25] that's got an expiration date on it you
[44:27] know why cuz we took some of it to them
[44:30] so they're handing out potato chips and
[44:32] they're handing out Cheerios and they're
[44:34] handed out all kinds of things but
[44:36] there's a date on that macaroni and
[44:39] cheese box there's a date on that Ragu
[44:42] bottle but they don't realize when they
[44:45] get behind the pull pit that they're
[44:47] preaching a message which has expired 75
[44:51] years ago so now they're giving some of
[44:53] the same thing over and over again now
[44:56] if we took food from our our place over
[44:59] here and and it was 10 years past due
[45:02] and people got sick boy that'd be want
[45:05] to chase us down and say why that bunch
[45:07] of Word of Life people them bunch of
[45:10] Hypocrites they was passing out Cheerios
[45:12] and they knew it was outdated they was
[45:15] passing out Pop-Tarts and they was three
[45:17] months overdue and it made a bunch of
[45:20] them people sick and yet if preachers
[45:23] will get in the pulpit and preach
[45:25] against other preachers andur churches
[45:27] that are handing out outdated word it's
[45:30] like you're some type of crazy person or
[45:33] something they look at you and think
[45:34] what in the world's wrong with you would
[45:37] any of you want to eat ters that had
[45:39] expired 10 years ago would any of you
[45:42] want to eat some of this stuff and you
[45:44] turn it over and look at it and say oh
[45:46] my goodness that come over with Noah on
[45:49] the ark I can't believe I ain't feeding
[45:52] my children that stuff but yet
[45:54] spiritually people will set for years of
[45:58] their life and they will feed on a word
[46:02] that has been expired for a complete
[46:05] Church age now you understand the
[46:08] Methodist they're feeding them on a word
[46:12] that is to church ages outdated the
[46:15] Pentecostal and now the briad age so
[46:18] they're feeding them on that
[46:20] Presbyterian on back on back but yet we
[46:23] realize that for many of them that's all
[46:26] they'll ever be able to hear but myself
[46:29] I'm grateful to God that God has opened
[46:31] up our eyes and we can take this message
[46:35] and look at the expiration date on it
[46:37] and I'll tell you what it says until the
[46:40] Lord comes so our message does not
[46:44] expire don't worry about it expiring
[46:46] this year or next year if time goes on
[46:49] 10 more years our message will run right
[46:52] on up to the bride call for the
[46:55] Rapture thank God for that so you know
[46:58] whenever we realize what God has done we
[47:00] ought to be so grateful of course and
[47:02] that it doesn't become common to us and
[47:04] we become complacent now what people do
[47:07] as far as helping and I am so grateful I
[47:10] mentioned about Dolly paron the other
[47:11] day I'm so grateful that woman gave $2
[47:13] million I'm so grateful there's so many
[47:16] people that's contacted us and we're
[47:18] getting money from people in California
[47:20] money from people here and there and
[47:22] there a lot of them a't even saved what
[47:24] if we'd see a lot of them women they
[47:26] don't tell and what they look like them
[47:28] men but you know what their money spends
[47:30] just as good on a gallon of gas as yours
[47:32] does as the Holy Ghost feel sa so if
[47:34] they want to help I say praise the Lord
[47:37] for it thank God for it but yet we know
[47:41] that it takes more than helping in the
[47:44] time of Calamity in order to meet the
[47:46] challenge of this hour now after a while
[47:50] this will become calm down many of these
[47:52] people they told us today people over
[47:54] North Carolina many of them W him get
[47:56] electricity back till January which if
[47:58] you know is going to be in the middle of
[47:59] winter how in the world they're going to
[48:01] survive but eventually it'll become more
[48:04] commonplace th some of them told us
[48:06] today if this if this hurricane hits
[48:08] Florida they're going to forget about us
[48:10] they're going to forget about us but
[48:12] some of our brothers tell them no we
[48:13] won't forget about you we'll still be
[48:15] here to help you but that's the way it
[48:18] is because in crisis everybody changes
[48:21] ain't it amazing how nice people are
[48:23] that' be Baptist rub shoulders as
[48:25] Presbyterian Presbyterian rub shoulders
[48:27] the Church of Christ and they'll go in
[48:29] there we saw them today coming in with
[48:30] their little bags going through getting
[48:32] the Pop-Tarts getting the Cheerios
[48:34] getting toothpast getting toothbrushes
[48:36] they don't ask you what denomination you
[48:38] are what church you go to they really
[48:39] don't even care if you go to church or
[48:41] not but it won't be long that it'll
[48:44] revert back like it was preh Hurricane
[48:48] stage and then it'll be right back the
[48:51] way it was before why because it's
[48:53] something about human nature but we
[48:56] still want to be holy ghost filled word
[48:59] living Christians after the hurricane
[49:02] damage is all repaired is that right we
[49:05] don't want our good works to be seasonal
[49:08] we don't want our good behavior to be
[49:11] seasonal we believe that we are in
[49:15] season every day out of the year is that
[49:19] right so for us to do good to other
[49:21] people it's not uncommon to us because
[49:24] that's the way we live and we're
[49:26] grateful that something moves on humans
[49:29] Hearts I said right out here day before
[49:31] yesterday and saw a a woman come up on
[49:33] the parking lot and she had some things
[49:35] in her arm and one of them was a tray of
[49:37] eggs and an egg carton poor looking
[49:40] woman probably didn't have much at all
[49:42] and I went out to meet her and I said
[49:43] ma'am can I carry that for you and she
[49:45] had a box of eggs and then she had
[49:47] another little box about that big and
[49:49] and another dozen or so maybe eggs on
[49:51] top of that and she said I didn't have
[49:53] no
[49:55] money yeah
[49:57] yes sir I didn't have nothing to give I
[50:00] said thank you so much I said somebody
[50:03] will get benefit out of this you know
[50:06] what I thought about that little woman
[50:09] maybe casting her little mites in the
[50:11] offering plate oh Hallelujah you imagine
[50:14] how small that little woman felt when
[50:16] she walked up there we just got all
[50:18] kinds of pallets of water all kinds of
[50:21] packages from Amazon boxes from here
[50:23] boxes from there I thought it it took a
[50:26] you know it took a pretty brave
[50:27] individual seeing them trucks one after
[50:30] another after another be unloaded I wish
[50:32] every one of us could look at at our own
[50:34] gifts to God when we come to the house
[50:37] of God the same way and you saying I I
[50:39] can't sing like this one I can't do like
[50:42] that one but maybe you bring your little
[50:43] two dozen eggs to Jesus it might not do
[50:46] nothing she said I I got a bunch of hens
[50:49] and and they lay really good so I heard
[50:51] y'all is doing this and I wanted to be
[50:53] able to share it thank God thank God
[50:56] don't you understand that's exactly the
[50:58] way he wants you to be in your life to
[51:00] the Lord Jesus well I can't give $5,000
[51:03] I can't give $10,000 can you give a
[51:06] nickel can you give a quarter can you
[51:08] give 50 cents can you come over and help
[51:10] separate some bags and boxes and can you
[51:13] tell somebody about Jesus come on
[51:15] somebody you see we're always comparing
[51:18] ourself to others and the devil uses
[51:20] that to talk us out of doing what we can
[51:24] which is our best God don't want you
[51:28] giving what somebody else can do God
[51:30] wants you giving your best that's all he
[51:33] requires of you now I want you to think
[51:36] that God is the one who gave this very
[51:38] law of of of reproduction and of sewing
[51:42] seed so the very seed that we will reap
[51:45] in the Harvest time and what we see
[51:47] coming up in our nation with socialism
[51:50] with Communism with all these things the
[51:53] seeds were swn years and years ago when
[51:56] brother ROM was here in the 50s and the
[51:58] 60s and preaching about things that was
[52:00] going to happen in America and a lot of
[52:02] people thought why he's out of his mind
[52:04] he's absolutely crazy there's no way
[52:05] it'll happen in our nation but yet we're
[52:07] looking at it happened right before our
[52:10] eyes and yet how did it come because it
[52:13] was sown in seed form years ago now it
[52:17] was thought to be awful the hippies and
[52:20] this and that my goodness the hippies
[52:22] are like Saints compared to what we got
[52:23] now we've got all off this bunch of s
[52:27] and immorality in the world we live and
[52:30] and that is so commonplace that if you
[52:32] speak against it it's not now you're the
[52:34] weirdo where years ago it was them that
[52:37] was strange but looks how much it's
[52:40] changed around they're not the strange
[52:42] ones anymore we are amen and the church
[52:46] said but I want you to think now the
[52:49] very first
[52:51] hybrid that there ever was on the
[52:55] Earth was not the
[52:58] devil it was not Fallen
[53:02] Angels it was actually
[53:06] Eve I figured that'd get your attention
[53:09] nothing else did now watch the prophet
[53:11] in the spoken words original C what did
[53:15] Eve try to do hybrid it mix it with
[53:19] something you've got to take it the way
[53:22] God spoke it and it won't mix with
[53:24] nothing God spoke spoken word is
[53:28] original and everything that God created
[53:31] spoke into existence is original and you
[53:35] can hyb some of his
[53:41] creation you can hybd some of his
[53:45] creation
[53:47] secondarily that's the reason Eve could
[53:50] do what she notice now did with her own
[53:54] seed because she she wasn't in the
[53:59] original
[54:01] creation had she been spoken word it
[54:05] would have been impossible for her to be
[54:08] a high breeder
[54:12] right because the original has life and
[54:18] because we come through Eve is the
[54:21] reason we
[54:23] die oh my now notice he said the
[54:27] original has life so that's the reason I
[54:29] think
[54:31] Cults and
[54:33] denominations and
[54:35] organizations die now don't limit this
[54:39] tonight to baptist Methodist
[54:41] Presbyterian Church of God we've got
[54:43] Cults in this message and the spirit of
[54:47] organization is around this message and
[54:50] look at every one of them that have
[54:52] raised up and show me after they had
[54:55] their so-called Revival where they ever
[54:57] had another one because they will live
[55:00] one time and then they will
[55:04] die why no original life of God because
[55:08] it's the message of the hour mixed with
[55:11] a man's ideology and then he'll say well
[55:15] you know the prophet didn't exactly say
[55:17] it that way but you know we need to add
[55:19] this and take away there the prophet
[55:21] even used the word polish it up polish
[55:24] it up now you imagine that is so
[55:26] different than completely deleting a
[55:29] word but you're just taking something
[55:32] and polishing it and just making it more
[55:35] shiny and make it more presentable
[55:38] friends I tell you I don't know if you
[55:40] understand or not a lot of message
[55:42] preachers that's what they're doing
[55:43] right now they're polishing this message
[55:46] and making it more acceptable leave this
[55:49] out leave that out add that a little bit
[55:51] twist this around a little bit and
[55:53] they're polishing it anybody know what
[55:54] this finish is called on this p up here
[55:57] tonight this is not the same finish that
[56:00] Brother D and den did on this right here
[56:03] this is called French
[56:06] polishing French polishing it's a it's a
[56:10] great art to be able to do it friend of
[56:13] mine and brother Daryl's brother Andrew
[56:16] down in New Zealand it's what he does
[56:18] for a living he's actually polished part
[56:21] of the Yachts of Donald Trump and a lot
[56:24] of famous people so they you imagine and
[56:26] they take their boat to New Zealand
[56:28] because he's so good at it and yet that
[56:31] piano would not look that way with the
[56:33] initial black coats on it so it's a
[56:36] process a process someone here in the
[56:39] church had a piano and someone had moved
[56:41] it several years ago and it had a
[56:43] finished similar to this not quite as
[56:45] high luster and they had damaged it and
[56:47] they wanted me to look at it and see if
[56:49] I could see if I could fix it possibly I
[56:52] was able to and be able to blend it in
[56:55] to where the the flaw disappeared but it
[56:58] was not French polished I would not have
[57:02] touched it had it been French polished
[57:05] first of all ly a
[57:07] Frenchman I don't know how to French
[57:09] polish so i' been out of my league but
[57:11] you see some preachers are not
[57:14] dislocators necessarily they're not
[57:17] splicers they're
[57:20] polishers so they polished the word to
[57:23] such a luster that in instead of you
[57:26] seeing Christ Jesus they polish it so
[57:30] you can see the image of
[57:33] yourself well I'll tell you one thing if
[57:35] that's what I succeed in doing here I
[57:38] have failed you that's I don't want you
[57:41] to see yourself I don't want you to see
[57:43] me I want us to see
[57:46] him now s the original High breeder on
[57:51] the earth oh my the prophet said once
[57:55] this happen they never did rise no more
[57:58] they never will they cannot they can't
[58:01] breathe themselves back got nothing to
[58:04] breed with they're sterile I think of
[58:09] every move that is raised down to the
[58:11] ages whether we would call it any
[58:14] denomination you wish to or a cult or a
[58:17] click or a clan and show me where they
[58:20] ever had a god-given holy ghost Revival
[58:24] after they come under the headship of
[58:25] man but because when you make man your
[58:27] head right there you
[58:30] die is that right now watch he said got
[58:34] nothing to breed back with they're
[58:36] sterile that's why Eevees children dies
[58:41] now remember every spoken word of God is
[58:44] the Original Seed and God planted
[58:46] everything in the Earth by his word and
[58:49] as long as you stay with the Original
[58:51] Seed it will breed itself right back and
[58:55] re produce itself again hybrid it it
[58:59] dies and Eve the
[59:03] woman was the first hybrid
[59:07] thing there ever
[59:11] was I want you to sing Adam could only
[59:15] father the children that were in
[59:19] him but Eve could be the mother of
[59:25] Adam's child
[59:27] and the Serpent's
[59:30] child but it was totally impossible for
[59:33] Adam to father
[59:36] came why he could not have come from his
[59:39] genes he was not part of his DNA but Eve
[59:43] the mother the church listen
[59:47] now she could mother both she could
[59:52] carry both Supply sustenance
[59:56] to both and both of them after they were
[59:59] born could truly call her mother but
[1:00:04] only one of them could
[1:00:07] truly call Adam
[1:00:11] father now saying that's not just for
[1:00:14] Eve but that is a type of the church now
[1:00:19] listen to me Word of Life Church is just
[1:00:24] like Eve was
[1:00:27] we can carry the true
[1:00:29] sea and give birth to the true sea or we
[1:00:34] can conceive a hybrid
[1:00:37] version and out of our
[1:00:40] assembly oh my goodness y'all quiet
[1:00:42] tonight can come
[1:00:46] Hybrid part message part Pentecost part
[1:00:50] message part Baptist part message part
[1:00:54] Methodist
[1:00:56] don't that turn look at me funny you
[1:00:58] understand that's going around all over
[1:00:59] the world in the ranks of the
[1:01:02] message and then we wonder why they
[1:01:05] can't stand the test they're not Jesus
[1:01:10] children they don't have his
[1:01:13] DNA wo I thought this would be quiet but
[1:01:15] I I didn't think it'd quite be this
[1:01:17] quiet would somebody at least grunt or
[1:01:19] something every now that just you know
[1:01:21] kind of squeeze out of an amen thank you
[1:01:25] now and Eve the woman I remember the
[1:01:28] first time that I stood in
[1:01:31] Norway and I I preached this and I I
[1:01:35] quoted that off the top of my head I
[1:01:38] didn't have the book in front of me and
[1:01:40] I said that Eve was the first hybrid
[1:01:44] that there ever was oh my I seen it go
[1:01:48] across in Preachers and I seen them look
[1:01:50] at one another thought son you're in for
[1:01:52] it after this sure enough after church
[1:01:56] that's waiting on
[1:01:58] me and they said brother we've been in
[1:02:00] the message for so many years and this
[1:02:02] is said I've been in the message for so
[1:02:04] many years and I've been in the message
[1:02:06] God's Prophet never said such a
[1:02:10] thing I said give me five minutes and
[1:02:13] I'll be right back
[1:02:19] right wasn't my fault they had never
[1:02:21] read that
[1:02:24] before now remember had she come spoken
[1:02:28] word it would have been totally
[1:02:30] impossible for the devil to ever found
[1:02:33] an entrance into the human
[1:02:36] race now remember God did not make him
[1:02:39] do it but he knew that he would so the
[1:02:41] attributes of the fullness of God would
[1:02:44] be able to be expressed but now remember
[1:02:46] don't just keep say our church Word of
[1:02:49] Life before you tonight as I'm preaching
[1:02:51] this but I want you to keep yourself as
[1:02:54] well because you are also are like Eve
[1:02:59] so am I so in our minds we can receive
[1:03:04] God's word God's word God's word in our
[1:03:08] minds we can also receive if we're not
[1:03:11] careful doubts it's not for you God
[1:03:14] don't love you well you know I'm not
[1:03:16] sure brother Donnie's right on that now
[1:03:17] I'm not sure brother ROM's right why
[1:03:20] because you are like Eve was so in your
[1:03:24] mind in your spiritual
[1:03:26] how many knows it's the truth that
[1:03:27] happens to us all the time and you think
[1:03:30] well I'm not even a Christian no you're
[1:03:32] just exactly answering out your type but
[1:03:35] that's what makes the bride of Christ
[1:03:37] absolutely a wonderful miraculous thing
[1:03:39] of God in the last day that she will not
[1:03:42] do what the first Eve did so it's not
[1:03:45] like God is going to keep us from Satan
[1:03:47] having access to that but he's going to
[1:03:50] allow the devil to do it but he's going
[1:03:52] to say come on sweetheart let me fill
[1:03:54] you with my life and and I will be in
[1:03:57] you and I will see the seal the womb of
[1:04:00] your soul and I will pregnate you with
[1:04:03] my word and I will seal myself in your
[1:04:08] soul and though Satan May attack your
[1:04:11] mind he will never get in your soul
[1:04:14] after you got the Holy
[1:04:17] Ghost praise be to
[1:04:22] God now watch he says she
[1:04:26] was a high
[1:04:29] breeder a
[1:04:32] bride a high
[1:04:35] breeder a
[1:04:38] bride notice through that brought death
[1:04:41] through trying to take the word of God
[1:04:45] and
[1:04:46] mix notice not
[1:04:49] lies not transgender stuff not
[1:04:52] homosexual stuff not but what WI
[1:04:57] a better
[1:04:59] understanding well you know he he he
[1:05:01] didn't exactly say it this way but
[1:05:03] that's what he meant wow it's just
[1:05:05] amazing to me how many preachers we've
[1:05:07] got in this day that knows what the
[1:05:09] prophet meant even though he didn't say
[1:05:10] anything wow I must not have got that
[1:05:13] mint version somehow in my message I
[1:05:16] must not have got that mint version of
[1:05:17] the Holy Ghost brother dles I I I just
[1:05:20] keep running across them statements
[1:05:21] where he says anybody that adds to what
[1:05:22] I say don't believe what I say that's
[1:05:25] the version of the message that I got
[1:05:28] the one I got says it's three times in
[1:05:30] the Bible it's an unpardonable sin to
[1:05:34] add one word of your own interpretation
[1:05:38] to a message after it's been Vindicated
[1:05:39] to be the
[1:05:41] truth I got that scary version of the of
[1:05:44] the message I love it though praise God
[1:05:49] now notice she was a hbed or a bride
[1:05:52] notice to that brought death through
[1:05:54] trying to take the word of God and make
[1:05:56] some wisdom with it
[1:05:59] see oh
[1:06:02] my now let's let's jump from 1962 here
[1:06:05] for a
[1:06:06] moment to power of transformation in
[1:06:12] 1965 there is always
[1:06:15] Twins and that's the reason don't forget
[1:06:19] this little
[1:06:20] flock the church in the last days is
[1:06:25] gone going to be
[1:06:27] twins Matthew 24:24 see the church is
[1:06:31] going it's a
[1:06:34] Pentecostal
[1:06:37] move notice he doesn't identify it as
[1:06:40] the original
[1:06:42] Pentecost he differentiates between the
[1:06:45] original Pentecost or as he called an in
[1:06:48] future home or rising of the sun
[1:06:51] Pentecostal
[1:06:53] genuine but he calls it a Pentecostal
[1:06:58] move now listen this is your
[1:07:01] Prophet the church in the last days is
[1:07:05] going to be
[1:07:06] twins so close that deceive the very
[1:07:09] elected Matthew 24:24 the church it's a
[1:07:12] Pentecostal move it's so much like the
[1:07:16] real thing it would deceive the very
[1:07:20] elected if it was
[1:07:22] possible and a little later if I get a
[1:07:25] chance I want to explain how that
[1:07:27] election comes see it's going to deceive
[1:07:30] them because it's almost like the same
[1:07:33] thing see just
[1:07:37] two uh
[1:07:41] oh so here we are in Satan's
[1:07:45] Eden and we're going back to a similar
[1:07:47] setting as it was in the garden of you
[1:07:50] two
[1:07:51] fathers same mother
[1:07:56] so we got the second Adam which is the
[1:08:00] father of course of all true original
[1:08:02] preg naations of the word and we got the
[1:08:06] devil where will they be then well that
[1:08:09] our twin is it episcopari
[1:08:13] how could it be a twin to us and be
[1:08:17] that how could my twin be the
[1:08:22] pope Lord have mercy if y'all think he's
[1:08:24] my twin you need to get rid of be
[1:08:27] quick my twin is not going to be a First
[1:08:35] Baptist our twin is not going to be a
[1:08:38] cold dead church it's going to be a
[1:08:41] church that believes in worshiping God
[1:08:42] and preaching the message shouting every
[1:08:44] now and then have the spirit of God
[1:08:46] among them come on that'll be our
[1:08:50] twin notice how he says this two fathers
[1:08:54] that's all
[1:08:56] two
[1:08:58] fathers same
[1:09:01] mother so years ago from the womb of the
[1:09:06] message
[1:09:07] people men started Rising even before
[1:09:10] the prophet left but especially after he
[1:09:13] was
[1:09:14] gone so then they started rising and
[1:09:17] well you know this one is an apostle and
[1:09:20] this one was sent to add
[1:09:23] Clarity to the message
[1:09:26] to help us understand what brother
[1:09:29] Brenham
[1:09:31] meant now you think them men are going
[1:09:34] to stop saying what brother man said no
[1:09:36] they're not going to stop saying it
[1:09:37] because that's their
[1:09:39] bait that's what they put on the rod to
[1:09:42] throw it out though well the prophet
[1:09:44] said watch New York watch New York keep
[1:09:46] your eyes on New York something's going
[1:09:48] to come out of New York boy did they
[1:09:51] wear that quote Out Boy something's
[1:09:53] coming out of New York yeah then the one
[1:09:55] in South Africa oh brother brandham said
[1:09:58] I'm laying the foundation from one I'm
[1:10:00] laying the platform for one yeah it was
[1:10:03] Jesus you knucklehead not
[1:10:06] you amen God's Prophet wasn't the
[1:10:08] building the platform for Donnie Reagan
[1:10:10] he wasn't building it for Daryl Ward or
[1:10:12] for some other preacher he's building it
[1:10:15] he said my mission is to forun that
[1:10:18] coming word hallelujah he said I'm not
[1:10:21] here to tell you he's coming I'm here to
[1:10:24] tell you he is here
[1:10:27] amen he is
[1:10:31] here
[1:10:33] my so it's the same
[1:10:36] mother same
[1:10:38] church same
[1:10:42] movement same
[1:10:45] thing I've often wondered what it must
[1:10:48] have been like I know y'all think I'm
[1:10:50] weird anyway but I've often wondered
[1:10:53] what it was like in the first home
[1:10:56] in the first
[1:10:58] family so when them boys were
[1:11:01] born and from the birth I mean one of
[1:11:03] them looked different than the other one
[1:11:05] I mean no question about it but maybe it
[1:11:09] took a while before his nature started
[1:11:13] coming
[1:11:14] out and Adam and Eve looking at him and
[1:11:17] watching him and of course they kept it
[1:11:20] a secret from Abel as a matter of fact
[1:11:23] the prophet said they taught them boys
[1:11:27] that it was fruit that put them out of
[1:11:29] the Garden of Eden but you can't hide
[1:11:32] God from an
[1:11:34] elected God will get his
[1:11:37] children was it there was two was it
[1:11:40] four five wonder how old it was brother
[1:11:42] Rob that maybe even little Abel started
[1:11:45] noticing boy my brother's aggressive man
[1:11:48] I mean look look at him he is he is so
[1:11:50] different he he don't he don't really
[1:11:52] act like Daddy he sort of acts like Mama
[1:11:55] part of Mama maybe he's really different
[1:11:58] I don't understand him wonder what it is
[1:12:00] about him and then him even you know the
[1:12:02] way the elect generally do they'll
[1:12:04] they'll look at themsel and say well
[1:12:05] he's probably a better man than I am and
[1:12:06] I probably ain't no good no way I'm
[1:12:08] probably the serpent seed you know how
[1:12:09] how the devil does and then it went on
[1:12:12] until in the process of
[1:12:16] time they both felt the pull to go to
[1:12:22] church so Abel was out with his flock
[1:12:25] and Cain was growing his vegetables and
[1:12:29] his
[1:12:30] flowers oh he must have been a gardener
[1:12:34] I imagine he thought glory to
[1:12:37] God the prophet oh breaks into a realm
[1:12:41] and it's almost like he's hearing Cain's
[1:12:44] prayer and he said he folded his hands
[1:12:47] and you know just said these beautiful
[1:12:49] words of orthodoxia oh great almighty
[1:12:52] God I've come to you today to worship
[1:12:55] you and he brought his vegetables and
[1:12:57] his flowers and his fruits and laid them
[1:13:00] on the
[1:13:01] Altar and here come his little Holy
[1:13:04] Roller
[1:13:05] brother he grabbed a grape vine and tied
[1:13:08] around that Little Lamb's neck and here
[1:13:10] come that little
[1:13:17] lamb and on his way in Abel reaches down
[1:13:20] and grabs a hold of a rock and he takes
[1:13:22] that little lamb and lays it on the
[1:13:24] Altar and throws his neck back and you
[1:13:26] imagine Adam and Eve looking at one
[1:13:28] another did you tell him no I never told
[1:13:32] him we said we wouldn't want to tell
[1:13:35] him how did he find that
[1:13:39] out that's why some of your parents are
[1:13:41] still wondering about you what in the
[1:13:44] world are they doing at that brown of my
[1:13:46] church if I could get a hold of who told
[1:13:48] him well have good luck getting a hold
[1:13:49] to him I'll tell you God will get a hold
[1:13:52] to his I don't care what he's got to do
[1:13:55] he'll get a hold to you he'll run you
[1:13:56] out of that hen house that's right that
[1:13:59] Pastor running in the barnyard oh it's a
[1:14:01] cult it's a cult it's a cult but you
[1:14:03] look at yourself and you say glory to
[1:14:06] God here I come mama here I come I'm out
[1:14:09] of here it can't hold me in here why
[1:14:11] because you are one of those seeds of
[1:14:15] God you imagine the prophet said that
[1:14:17] God had revealed it Abel was not there
[1:14:21] when the Lord God killed that lamb and
[1:14:23] throw the skins in behind the bush to
[1:14:25] Adam and Eve and said walk out oh my but
[1:14:28] something dropped down in his heart he
[1:14:31] said he knew he was born in his mother's
[1:14:35] blood of his father's
[1:14:38] blood and here he come and they looked
[1:14:41] at one another and hadam said oh my
[1:14:45] God he knows he knows he
[1:14:50] knows he knows I've been lying to him
[1:15:00] here he brings it up tears pouring out
[1:15:03] his
[1:15:04] eyes glory to God oh
[1:15:08] yahe had your
[1:15:12] name and he gets that little lamb and it
[1:15:14] goes to hacking on its
[1:15:18] NE and he died speaking in language
[1:15:22] abble didn't understand and he looks at
[1:15:26] himself blood all over his hands blood
[1:15:29] all over his arms blood all over his
[1:15:31] clothes and Cain is looking at him so
[1:15:37] mad I was worshiping I was praying I was
[1:15:41] trying to get right with God and here
[1:15:43] you come in here look at you you've
[1:15:47] interrupted my
[1:15:51] service well if we're worshiping like
[1:15:53] Caine we need to be interrupted
[1:15:55] I think it do us good sometimes to just
[1:15:57] get interrupted out of our Orthodoxy
[1:16:00] don't you to get out of our our routine
[1:16:03] and out of our system where we can just
[1:16:05] get lost in the Holy Ghost
[1:16:08] [Applause]
[1:16:10] Hallelujah but he was sure and
[1:16:14] confident his mama hadn't taught him his
[1:16:17] daddy hadn't taught him but almighty God
[1:16:19] dropped that Revelation down in his
[1:16:21] heart maybe he out there in the field
[1:16:23] and it struck him and the Lord God spoke
[1:16:26] to him I want that
[1:16:30] lamb but but for
[1:16:33] what an
[1:16:36] offering for my lamb
[1:16:40] for but I thought daddy said well that's
[1:16:43] what they taught me at the Seminary that
[1:16:45] that's what they've always said that you
[1:16:47] was three Gods that's what you've always
[1:16:49] said that they eat an apple in the
[1:16:50] Garden of Eden it wasn't the apple on
[1:16:52] the tree is the par on the ground
[1:16:55] p p a i
[1:16:58] R2 you imagine brother darling as you
[1:17:00] walks up there you and I ought to walk
[1:17:01] just as confident tonight into the house
[1:17:04] of God and sit down say praise God I'm
[1:17:07] redeemed praise God my sins are forgiven
[1:17:10] me I'm going to heaven just as sure as
[1:17:12] there's a God in heaven I'm going to
[1:17:13] heaven and you have that absolute
[1:17:14] confidence that you are right with God
[1:17:17] and you are ready to leave this world
[1:17:19] why God's revealed it to
[1:17:23] you praise be to
[1:17:26] God same mother same movement same
[1:17:31] teaching but God burst
[1:17:34] Abel out of the teaching of his
[1:17:37] father just like it did many of
[1:17:42] you watch this same movement same thing
[1:17:45] the beding ground is the same where the
[1:17:48] word Falls but one of them like here is
[1:17:51] perverted you understand Say Amen
[1:17:55] amen congregation says
[1:18:04] am same
[1:18:06] mother same
[1:18:08] movement same
[1:18:10] books same
[1:18:12] tapes same
[1:18:15] Prophet but out of there will come all
[1:18:17] types of little isms from around this
[1:18:19] message in the last days to pull try to
[1:18:23] pull the the people's attention from the
[1:18:26] reality of the core of what God has done
[1:18:29] and say well if it's right what about
[1:18:30] this and what about that if you're going
[1:18:32] to use that same principle with the
[1:18:33] message you've got to use the same
[1:18:34] principle with Jesus Christ what about
[1:18:36] Peter which turned out to be a cussing
[1:18:38] preacher what about Judas that turned
[1:18:40] out to be a liar and a
[1:18:42] deceiver oh come on that don't hold up
[1:18:45] that don't hold up at all because the
[1:18:46] Lord Jesus had all kinds of people
[1:18:48] around him that did not believe the
[1:18:49] truth he had 70 preachers with him one
[1:18:51] day and he turned around and said does
[1:18:52] this offend you what about this if
[1:18:54] you'll see the son of man ascending up
[1:18:56] where he was and some of them preachers
[1:18:58] that was following him the Bible said
[1:19:01] turned and walked with him no more St
[1:19:04] John
[1:19:08] 666 chapter 6 verse 66 they turned and
[1:19:13] walked with him no more there's your
[1:19:16] mark of the beast people who know the
[1:19:19] truth and turn and walk away from it and
[1:19:22] seal with the devil's Mark oh brother
[1:19:24] Donnie that's scares me to death it
[1:19:25] shouldn't if you've got the Seal of God
[1:19:27] you ain't got one thing to worry about
[1:19:30] your soul is sealed in the presence of
[1:19:32] God your mind the devil might do it but
[1:19:35] if your soul is sealed it belongs to the
[1:19:38] Lord God
[1:19:40] forever can I go a bit
[1:19:42] farther now watch this the prophet deals
[1:19:44] with this of course in various messages
[1:19:47] down through the span of time when he's
[1:19:48] here but listen to this anointing ones
[1:19:50] them time remember you couldn't feed a
[1:19:52] luer back in them days you can now
[1:19:55] Catholic aaran no sir he had fresh meat
[1:20:00] that was the church age you couldn't
[1:20:02] feed Methodist Lucen message oh no he
[1:20:05] didn't want that carrying it's
[1:20:08] rotten you see the life had done left it
[1:20:11] and went into something else that's the
[1:20:14] old stalk that's dead back there the
[1:20:16] life is moving
[1:20:18] on can I say
[1:20:21] it neither can you feed
[1:20:25] the Bride of Jesus
[1:20:31] Christ
[1:20:34] Pentecostalism now notice there's a
[1:20:37] differentiation between Pentecostal
[1:20:40] genuine and
[1:20:43] Pentecostalism I don't want to feed our
[1:20:45] church Pentecostalism and to be honest
[1:20:48] with you I don't want no other preacher
[1:20:50] standing here preing Pentecostal ISM
[1:20:52] either praise the Lord why because it
[1:20:56] may not be but one person in that se but
[1:20:58] go in their heart and then 6 months down
[1:21:01] the road a year down the road if the
[1:21:03] latter of rain falls and they grapple
[1:21:05] that seed inside of their heart it's
[1:21:07] going to affect their product I want you
[1:21:09] to be virgin bride I don't want you to
[1:21:12] be a mix
[1:21:14] Eve I want you to be the second Eve
[1:21:18] which refuses the devil serpent
[1:21:21] SE praise the Lord
[1:21:25] so then according to the prophet
[1:21:27] messenger you cannot feed the Bride of
[1:21:30] Jesus Christ Pentecostal ISM so was
[1:21:33] brother brandham against the Pentecostal
[1:21:35] experience absolutely not was he against
[1:21:38] Pentecostal genuine brother skip of
[1:21:41] course not but he was against
[1:21:49] Pentecostalism no
[1:21:51] indeed maget blowed
[1:21:56] organizations nothing doing no
[1:22:01] no for the promis is and before the
[1:22:04] great and treble day shall come I'll
[1:22:06] send unto you Elijah the prophet he will
[1:22:10] restore the hearts of the children back
[1:22:13] to the faith of the fathers again now
[1:22:15] not ausa Street back to the original in
[1:22:20] Acts chapter
[1:22:22] 2 and the church said
[1:22:25] and they did not base their their
[1:22:27] experience upon Sensations or emotion
[1:22:31] they did not believe tongues was the
[1:22:33] evidence of the Holy Ghost they did not
[1:22:35] believe you had to shout to have church
[1:22:37] every
[1:22:38] night well come on somebody I realize a
[1:22:42] lot of the folks get into a routine and
[1:22:45] a ritual and an order some people saying
[1:22:48] that order is only move not moving
[1:22:52] hardly at all they said boy I'll tell
[1:22:53] you one thing I never wanted to get into
[1:22:55] no order I never I'm against order I'm
[1:22:58] against order but they don't read far
[1:23:00] enough to realize sometimes order has a
[1:23:03] lot of movement to
[1:23:05] it uhhuh let me tell you something
[1:23:09] thirst 1965 when you're worshiping God
[1:23:13] in the spirit and in truth when it
[1:23:17] becomes
[1:23:19] accustom for you to do it because you
[1:23:23] think you are ought to do it oh my
[1:23:27] goodness you mean so we could get into a
[1:23:31] ritual and a routine brother Adam and we
[1:23:34] just raise our hands and it's just well
[1:23:36] that's what we're supposed to do when we
[1:23:37] go to church so we just do it and and we
[1:23:39] lose our sincerity we lose our emotion
[1:23:42] about it and it just becomes ritual and
[1:23:44] routine you understand you're drinking
[1:23:46] from a Cess
[1:23:49] poool
[1:23:51] oh now notice he says you becomes
[1:23:55] accustom for you to do it because you
[1:23:57] think you ought to do it because you
[1:23:59] think if you don't
[1:24:02] shout or jump up and down or dance with
[1:24:05] the music your neighbor is going to
[1:24:08] think you're
[1:24:10] backslid you're drinking from a
[1:24:13] stagnated stream see you understand
[1:24:16] people can jump and shout and holler and
[1:24:18] run and speak in tongues and they're
[1:24:20] still drinking from a stagnated stream
[1:24:23] you know why because they think they've
[1:24:24] got to do it because everybody's going
[1:24:26] to look at it hey I believe in dancing
[1:24:28] in the spirit oh I love to do it but I
[1:24:30] ain't going to dance cuz people think I
[1:24:32] ought to I ain't even going to dance
[1:24:34] because the music is fast if I dance
[1:24:37] it's when the Holy Ghost hits me to
[1:24:38] dance and when he hits me look out devil
[1:24:41] here I come I'm on to dance I'll dance
[1:24:43] all over you if you get in my way I'll
[1:24:45] dance across there I'll dance up here
[1:24:47] wherever but I ain't going to do it
[1:24:49] because people stand there looking at
[1:24:51] come on now brother Donnie get in the
[1:24:52] spirit well you ain't the one to tells
[1:24:54] me to get in the spirit it's the spirit
[1:24:56] of God if he falls upon me come on
[1:24:59] somebody I'm not going to get into a
[1:25:01] ritual or a routine that I've got to
[1:25:03] dance every service or every third
[1:25:05] service or every fourth service because
[1:25:07] that is drinking from a stagnated sister
[1:25:11] you can be screaming to the top of your
[1:25:13] voice running the pews jumping shouting
[1:25:16] until you are wore out and drinking from
[1:25:19] a stagnated system
[1:25:26] right why because it becomes with the
[1:25:29] Rhythm the rhythm of the
[1:25:31] music and the fast songs are played and
[1:25:34] then we dance and then when they stop
[1:25:36] the
[1:25:37] music all the dancing is
[1:25:42] stopped well if we're dancing in the
[1:25:44] spirit you mean the spirit itself can't
[1:25:46] dance without everything going wide open
[1:25:48] G or a or whatever morning oh glory to
[1:25:51] God are going to be a meeting in the and
[1:25:54] then Harry quits and the spirit says
[1:25:56] whoa I got to follow brother Harry you
[1:25:58] got to be kidding me you mean our Holy
[1:25:59] Ghost is that flame say he's following
[1:26:00] Harry and
[1:26:01] Louie if the Holy Ghost is dancing you
[1:26:04] brother I'll tell you what you could
[1:26:05] dance to near my God to thee you don't
[1:26:08] need Moses in the bull rush I mean when
[1:26:10] the Holy Ghost is on you you can D je
[1:26:12] friend you see what it's doing you see
[1:26:15] what it's doing ausa street is merging
[1:26:17] itself into our message and people are
[1:26:20] say oh this is the move of God and this
[1:26:22] is the bran move really
[1:26:26] so you mean the end time message is a
[1:26:29] repeat of a Zeus
[1:26:33] hisry I know people don't like to hear
[1:26:35] me say it but see this is the same stuff
[1:26:37] I saw in
[1:26:40] Pentecost as a matter of fact that's
[1:26:42] some of the same stuff I preached in
[1:26:44] Pentecost and I was a Pentecostal
[1:26:48] preacher and if it worked last night
[1:26:51] we'll try her again tonight right here
[1:26:53] Andor out and the next
[1:27:01] time I don't want
[1:27:07] Pentecostalism I want genuine Holy Ghost
[1:27:12] Pentecost it'll not only make you shout
[1:27:15] it'll make you cry it'll not only make
[1:27:18] you cry it'll make you love your brother
[1:27:21] it'll even make you love your
[1:27:23] wife it'll make you love your husband
[1:27:25] come on somebody it'll make you love
[1:27:27] somebody in the church that don't even
[1:27:29] like you well Hallelujah it'll make you
[1:27:32] treat people right that have treated you
[1:27:34] wrong it will make you so much like
[1:27:37] Jesus that the devil would get scared to
[1:27:40] death of the life you're living not how
[1:27:42] high you're dancing I don't want the
[1:27:45] devil to get scared of my dance I want
[1:27:47] the devil to be scared of my life that's
[1:27:50] the Thunder that scares the devil oh oh
[1:27:55] praise the
[1:27:57] Lord look children the latter rains
[1:28:00] fixing to fall what is that the coming
[1:28:02] of the Lord the precursor to the
[1:28:04] Rapture and he's going to prove who's
[1:28:08] his oh my notice because you think if
[1:28:12] you don't shout or jump up and down or
[1:28:14] dance with the music your neighbor is
[1:28:16] going to think you're backslid you are
[1:28:18] drinking from a stagnated
[1:28:21] stream and you see most people would
[1:28:23] think
[1:28:25] there's no way you're drinking from
[1:28:27] stagnation if you're extremely
[1:28:29] emotional you know where that comes from
[1:28:34] Pentecost now the sad part about it is
[1:28:36] some of the brothers in the message were
[1:28:37] never in
[1:28:39] Pentecost and they don't even recognize
[1:28:42] ausa street is appearing Among Us Again
[1:28:47] well I'm going preach with or without
[1:28:49] you it look better for you all on the
[1:28:50] day of judgment if you get with me
[1:28:51] though
[1:28:55] M listen this until it fills every
[1:29:00] fiber until the holy spirit is bubbling
[1:29:04] itself in you I don't care that the
[1:29:06] whether the music is playing whether
[1:29:08] they're playing near am my God to thee
[1:29:10] or whatever it is the holy spirit is
[1:29:12] still ringing the glory bells in your
[1:29:15] heart that satisfies that's God's
[1:29:17] satisfying portion anything less than
[1:29:20] that you're done
[1:29:29] you're
[1:29:32] done you see when brother randam was
[1:29:35] here he would preach to the Baptist and
[1:29:37] Presbyterians would come different ones
[1:29:40] but he was also preaching to the
[1:29:44] Pentecostals and it's amazing because
[1:29:46] you find Brothers in the message when
[1:29:48] brother Brandon would be at a certain
[1:29:49] place he may be maybe if it's Pentecost
[1:29:51] is and they extreme Pentecost and he
[1:29:53] would say things to bring them in line
[1:29:56] Brothers in the message that don't
[1:29:57] believe in the Pentecostal experience
[1:29:58] that's the quotes they gravitate toward
[1:30:02] others then he might be in a Baptist
[1:30:04] Church or a little bit of cold Church of
[1:30:05] Pentecost like it was there in 1963 in
[1:30:08] Arkansas when he come back to the
[1:30:09] Tabernacle and told him said now the
[1:30:11] reason I preached that was because that
[1:30:13] group of people was vearing off into
[1:30:15] something wrong so the prophet was
[1:30:17] trying to bring them back well according
[1:30:19] to PR preachers mainly they're the main
[1:30:21] troublemakers according to preachers
[1:30:23] makeup they will go through the message
[1:30:25] and find which quotes that lines up with
[1:30:28] their thinking which is the exact
[1:30:31] opposite what we ought to do we ought to
[1:30:33] line our quotes up our our thinking
[1:30:35] rather up with the quotes instead of the
[1:30:37] quotes with our thinking come on
[1:30:39] somebody so we got a bunch of high
[1:30:42] breeders that are sitting in their study
[1:30:44] and it ain't no wonder that we got so
[1:30:46] much confusion and the Sheep don't know
[1:30:48] what to believe I'm going to tell you
[1:30:50] what to believe tonight thus sayeth the
[1:30:51] Lord and God don't lie and God don't
[1:30:55] miss well come on somebody I'll tell you
[1:30:58] friends we're not just preaching we're
[1:31:00] not just coming to church but we're so
[1:31:02] and seit we're in the former Reign and
[1:31:05] we're in the latter Reign to where God's
[1:31:07] leading right up and the final climax of
[1:31:11] this is the rapture and he's going to
[1:31:13] prove which one is his now let me read
[1:31:16] to you how
[1:31:18] dangerous how
[1:31:21] dangerous it is
[1:31:24] God will
[1:31:27] punish
[1:31:30] punish
[1:31:31] people who try to add to this
[1:31:36] word now notice it will not mix it must
[1:31:39] not be tempered with God will
[1:31:45] punish the one who does
[1:31:49] it it's a serious thing for any preacher
[1:31:54] has been preaching how many miracles
[1:31:55] he's got or whatever to add to God's
[1:31:58] word to try to change the thinking of
[1:31:59] the word of this
[1:32:01] hour no preacher is exempt from Divine
[1:32:07] punishment praise the
[1:32:10] Lord a lot of preachers are in this day
[1:32:12] are trying to raise their spiritual kids
[1:32:14] the way parents are raising
[1:32:17] theirs now
[1:32:19] honey I'm counting to three
[1:32:32] one they believe in
[1:32:35] grace
[1:32:40] two some of y'all are wanting to say it
[1:32:42] so bad you're ready to scream it out
[1:32:43] yourself ain't
[1:32:47] you it ain't no wonder we're raising a
[1:32:50] bunch of beatnicks and
[1:32:51] heathens no wonder our children hate to
[1:32:53] pops no wonder a lot of our children I'm
[1:32:55] talking about out here in the age why
[1:32:57] they hate Authority why they're raised
[1:32:59] by a bunch of of heathens and that hate
[1:33:02] Authority come on oh
[1:33:06] my notice how serious now that God will
[1:33:11] punish the one that does it it will not
[1:33:14] hybrid to nothing else it's God's word
[1:33:17] alone God don't need listen how simple
[1:33:20] it is God don't need your
[1:33:25] word with
[1:33:28] his that's how simple it is leave our
[1:33:32] word out don't mix the message with
[1:33:36] James
[1:33:39] Dobson well brother Donnie don't you
[1:33:41] think some of these guys have some good
[1:33:42] things to say sure they do they have
[1:33:45] plenty of good things to say but we have
[1:33:47] a filter to run James Dobson through
[1:33:50] we've got a filter to run Jerry Chapman
[1:33:52] and all the rest of these guys out here
[1:33:54] intellectuals that study the Bible and
[1:33:57] so on and so on and so on God never sent
[1:34:00] us James Dobson is Malachi 4 God never
[1:34:03] sent us BTY Graham or or Gary Chapman or
[1:34:06] some of these great men out here God
[1:34:09] never send us Benny hand because we
[1:34:11] ain't
[1:34:13] H amen you don't send a hand together
[1:34:16] Eagles but you send an eagle together
[1:34:19] Eagles Hallelujah you send a prophet and
[1:34:22] on that prophet's Wings he carries them
[1:34:25] out of that bondage that they were
[1:34:27] in Hallelujah but Satan can't stand it
[1:34:32] and the sad part about it is it's always
[1:34:35] the same pattern a lot of the people who
[1:34:37] come out don't remember how important it
[1:34:38] is to say only what the messenger has
[1:34:41] spoken some will add here some will take
[1:34:43] away there and the word is no longer
[1:34:46] pure and the Revival dies the Revival
[1:34:49] dies and then when the Revival dies they
[1:34:52] go to looking for some kind of stirring
[1:34:54] to stir them back up again because they
[1:34:56] know they're missing something and when
[1:34:58] they do Satan will always stir them away
[1:35:01] from the word and it'll be this man or
[1:35:02] that man or this move or that move don't
[1:35:04] you hear me children we don't have to
[1:35:07] have Pentecostals to come and bring us a
[1:35:09] Revival how in the world can we feed the
[1:35:12] bride
[1:35:17] Pentecostalism oh
[1:35:19] my praise the
[1:35:22] Lord God don't need your word with his
[1:35:26] we're not supposed to speak our own word
[1:35:29] we're supposed to preach the word God's
[1:35:32] word now therefore true life can only
[1:35:35] come or reproduce itself by its
[1:35:39] original
[1:35:42] breeding so if the ausa street
[1:35:47] word was more powerful than the acts two
[1:35:51] word God got that mixed up
[1:35:54] God should have sent the isua one first
[1:35:57] and let that been the original and then
[1:36:00] God said I want have one everybody to do
[1:36:02] the way they
[1:36:06] did you see for some of you that was not
[1:36:09] in
[1:36:10] Pentecost and you're totally unaware of
[1:36:13] the way they used to
[1:36:14] be whether that some of them are now I
[1:36:16] will have to say this at least when we
[1:36:19] were still there in Pentecost there was
[1:36:21] a lot of genuine sincere ones
[1:36:24] only God knows how many sincere they are
[1:36:25] left they're still dancing they're still
[1:36:27] shouting so if you think that shouting
[1:36:29] and dancing is a move of God all you got
[1:36:31] to do is go on YouTube You'll see some
[1:36:33] of them churches out there at dancing
[1:36:34] any of us and you think we're the only
[1:36:37] ones Miracles and miracles is a sign of
[1:36:39] a bride all you got to do is pull it up
[1:36:41] on YouTube you'll find all kinds of
[1:36:43] Performing signs wonders and miracles as
[1:36:45] a matter of fact there someone told me
[1:36:47] not long a woman bobbed hair painted
[1:36:49] face earrings on pants on all kinds of
[1:36:51] stuff talking about signs and miracles
[1:36:53] was happening at one of our local
[1:36:55] Baptist
[1:36:57] Churches well maybe we should all close
[1:36:59] down our church and go
[1:37:03] there well
[1:37:06] Hallelujah notice this now therefore
[1:37:09] true life can only reproduce itself by
[1:37:12] its original breeding see now study that
[1:37:15] study the
[1:37:17] tapes study it now life and he spells it
[1:37:21] l i f e can only be reproduced by its
[1:37:25] original
[1:37:27] breeding the way it
[1:37:29] started at the
[1:37:32] beginning and of course the way the
[1:37:34] original Church started out was that
[1:37:37] they recorded tapes of Jesus
[1:37:40] preaching and then the apostles went out
[1:37:42] and just pressed
[1:37:46] play some of y'all are shaking your
[1:37:50] heads well I mean that's supposed to be
[1:37:52] the Perfection of what we are now
[1:37:55] right I mean we'll all be gathering
[1:37:58] Sunday so they say and we'll be hearing
[1:38:00] the literal voice of
[1:38:02] God we'll be hearing God himself preach
[1:38:05] to
[1:38:06] us and we can't trust preachers words
[1:38:09] and we can't trust these words and that
[1:38:11] words and we can only get it direct from
[1:38:13] God himself because that's God's
[1:38:15] original pattern and I'm
[1:38:17] thinking how have I done that man I've
[1:38:19] I've read this Bible since I was a boy
[1:38:21] how word did I miss reading that in the
[1:38:23] Bible but the original plan was that
[1:38:24] they play tapes of Jesus I mean I guess
[1:38:26] I don't understand
[1:38:28] it or either I
[1:38:32] do and what's being said is not original
[1:38:36] at all it's a hybridized
[1:38:42] prostitute and they're committing
[1:38:44] fornication with the
[1:38:47] devil well Glory you understand a lot of
[1:38:51] these denominational things around our
[1:38:53] ranks I'm going to go ahead and preach
[1:38:55] the seven Thunder deal the peria deal
[1:38:57] all these other deals you understand
[1:38:59] what they are ain't nothing but
[1:39:01] spiritual
[1:39:04] prostitutes Hallelujah but out of it all
[1:39:07] God will call a people there's been all
[1:39:11] kinds of men that raised up from India
[1:39:13] and raised up from the Philippines and
[1:39:15] raised up from South Africa and raised
[1:39:17] up from Tennessee and all over you know
[1:39:19] what but God will still has a bride and
[1:39:22] that bride is Virgin born and she will
[1:39:25] not compromise I got to thinking the
[1:39:28] other day brother Daryl and putting it
[1:39:29] down on my mind and thinking how many
[1:39:31] message preachers and they're doing way
[1:39:33] don't even preach anymore many of them
[1:39:35] the way brother renam taught marriage
[1:39:36] and divorce They Don't Preach the way
[1:39:38] brother renham tght about marriage They
[1:39:40] Don't Preach no more the faithfulness of
[1:39:42] going to church They Don't Preach no
[1:39:43] more the order the way the prophet
[1:39:45] taught the gifts I got to go through the
[1:39:47] different things that message preachers
[1:39:49] don't even preach it scared me I thought
[1:39:52] oh Lord we come so far that they leave
[1:39:55] that out we don't want this we don't
[1:39:57] want that we don't want that what are we
[1:39:59] going to produce I'll tell you what
[1:40:01] we're going to produce
[1:40:03] death
[1:40:12] death let's stand
[1:40:24] so when the rain
[1:40:26] falls what's it going to produce out of
[1:40:29] our
[1:40:31] church what's it going to produce out of
[1:40:34] your
[1:40:37] life it's
[1:40:40] coming it's producing
[1:40:42] communism
[1:40:44] socialism it's producing all these
[1:40:46] different things in the secular World
[1:40:48] cuz the seeds have been
[1:40:50] swn you ever remember the prophet
[1:40:52] whenever the spirit of God would anoint
[1:40:53] him to say it and he never said watch
[1:40:57] the
[1:41:01] USSR but it was always watch Russia but
[1:41:04] it amazing she was called USSR for
[1:41:07] decades and
[1:41:08] years but God went ahead and named her
[1:41:11] what should be in the present
[1:41:14] tense like God could say to you through
[1:41:17] his Prophet I no longer call you church
[1:41:20] but I call you bride amen we were
[1:41:24] renamed you remember when
[1:41:27] God told Moses go before pharaoh and
[1:41:32] tell him let my son
[1:41:37] go Israel is my
[1:41:41] firstborn that changed the hierarchy of
[1:41:44] everything they looked at them at slaves
[1:41:47] they own them yes sir so God had to
[1:41:50] change their identity amen and God could
[1:41:53] say say you got my young ons at your
[1:41:55] house turn them loose they were mine
[1:41:58] before they were yours so he told him
[1:42:00] walk in there and tell him thus sayeth
[1:42:02] the Lord let my son go my firstborn you
[1:42:07] understand our Exodus which is fixing to
[1:42:09] culminate and a body change that's what
[1:42:12] God's going to say to death it's working
[1:42:15] in our body every day we live her hair
[1:42:18] turning gray turning loose her eyes this
[1:42:20] and that and the other all happening to
[1:42:22] every one of us but God is going to say
[1:42:24] to death death let go of my
[1:42:27] firstborn our loved ones Hallelujah will
[1:42:30] come up glory to God our bodies will be
[1:42:33] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:42:35] an eye and death will be forced to let
[1:42:38] go of the second Eve and out of our womb
[1:42:44] will come forth the son of
[1:42:46] David for the millennium
[1:42:57] glory to
[1:42:59] God oh
[1:43:03] Jesus help us Lord
[1:43:07] God lord it's frightening
[1:43:12] sometimes as we look around and hear
[1:43:15] what's being
[1:43:17] preached what's been left out changed
[1:43:20] and modified
[1:43:23] and I think about it what will it be if
[1:43:25] time terries another five years another
[1:43:28] 10 will we even recognize the message
[1:43:31] it's being
[1:43:33] preached but we know you've got a people
[1:43:36] and they will stay true to that
[1:43:39] word our church is an
[1:43:43] eve but may have person here tonight
[1:43:45] walk not walk out of here and just with
[1:43:47] that thought but may they also say they
[1:43:50] are
[1:43:52] too the prophet when he preached this in
[1:43:54] the evening service is spoken words
[1:43:56] Original Seed and he told them I'd like
[1:43:58] to preach on the two
[1:44:01] ws and when he came back he
[1:44:04] did so we know Satan has
[1:44:07] access to that womb in our mind because
[1:44:09] that's the greatest battle it's where
[1:44:11] it's fought at right
[1:44:13] there so the Battleground is where the
[1:44:15] armaments
[1:44:16] meet so God bombs us as it was with
[1:44:20] quotes and scriptures and sermons and
[1:44:22] encourag in
[1:44:24] things then the devil will bomb us no
[1:44:27] wonder our mind looks like it's just
[1:44:30] blowed to
[1:44:31] Pieces because both of them are testing
[1:44:34] their strengths in our mind and how will
[1:44:37] the battle go it'll totally depend on
[1:44:40] us Eve had the capability of saying
[1:44:45] no to the
[1:44:48] serpent him being Anointed with the
[1:44:51] devil we know that the serpent didn't
[1:44:53] have a soul but he had a place for
[1:44:56] one and we know that Satan had a
[1:45:01] soul so he simply stepped inside the
[1:45:04] Serpent's
[1:45:05] body and in reality we know Cain had two
[1:45:09] fathers the serpent was the father of
[1:45:11] his body but the devil was the father of
[1:45:14] his
[1:45:16] nature so he looked physically not like
[1:45:19] the devil but he looked physically like
[1:45:22] a Mongrel a mixing a hybrid between Eve
[1:45:27] and
[1:45:28] Cain and Lord we look at some of the
[1:45:31] mistakes and the things that we have
[1:45:33] done in our
[1:45:34] lives a lot of us if we'd be honest
[1:45:37] tonight we produced a lot of canes in
[1:45:40] our own
[1:45:43] lives we try to think well you know the
[1:45:45] Lord will fix it and the Lord will take
[1:45:46] care of and he he'll he'll change it all
[1:45:49] he he'll he'll do this he'll do that
[1:45:51] we're the one who brought that Canan
[1:45:53] into the Earth and a lot of times we
[1:45:54] have to deal with it for
[1:45:56] years because we produced
[1:45:59] it but there's one thing I love about
[1:46:01] your
[1:46:02] grace even though
[1:46:05] Eve Lord God help them please
[1:46:08] Jesus please help
[1:46:11] them help them to realize what Eve
[1:46:16] forfeited the prophet on down here a
[1:46:18] little bit in these quotes said
[1:46:20] eve should have brought
[1:46:23] forth
[1:46:25] Christ he was that
[1:46:30] seed that she should have brought
[1:46:33] forth but instead of bringing forth
[1:46:37] Christ she settled for
[1:46:42] Cain Lord Jesus may we see it's the same
[1:46:45] thing for
[1:46:46] us we are offered this wonderful awesome
[1:46:51] privilege to give birth to Christ the
[1:46:56] word the product of this message of
[1:47:00] Malachi four a Bible believing people
[1:47:04] that are filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:47:06] has Miracles and signs and wonders and
[1:47:08] and Supernatural we don't have to go
[1:47:10] backwards to isusa Street to get
[1:47:13] that no the original had that oh I don't
[1:47:18] want to go backwards to get it I I want
[1:47:20] the original
[1:47:23] but Lord we preached it years ago in the
[1:47:24] book of Acts and I know some of the
[1:47:26] preachers didn't like it when I preached
[1:47:28] that book of Acts and I heard them talk
[1:47:30] about
[1:47:31] it and the reason they didn't like it
[1:47:33] was because I brought all the tests and
[1:47:35] all the trials that they had in the book
[1:47:37] of
[1:47:38] Acts because the book of Acts is not
[1:47:40] just wrote about miracles signs and
[1:47:42] wonders it's wrote about tests and
[1:47:45] failures and issues and
[1:47:47] problems and that's exactly the way
[1:47:49] every church is today that really
[1:47:50] believes the word we got signs yes we
[1:47:52] got Miracles but we have issues we have
[1:47:55] problems years ago we could Point our
[1:47:57] fingers at the denomination said oh
[1:47:59] y'all are mixed up in your marriages we
[1:48:01] can't point it no more we got it in our
[1:48:02] own
[1:48:04] ranks so what do we do we throw him
[1:48:09] out whenever Eve your daughter forfeited
[1:48:12] her
[1:48:13] rights to bring forth Christ the word
[1:48:17] you didn't throw her into
[1:48:19] hell you didn't step down there that day
[1:48:21] and look at Adam and say said you
[1:48:23] disobedient Ser
[1:48:26] son I hate
[1:48:29] you but you forgave him thank you when
[1:48:34] they was going out the Garden of Eden
[1:48:35] the prophet said you looked at that love
[1:48:37] and you couldn't understand
[1:48:38] it and you forced them to leave get
[1:48:42] out and right as they were starting out
[1:48:46] thank you little evening her blonde hair
[1:48:47] and her blue eyes leaned her head over
[1:48:49] on Adam's chest the tears running out
[1:48:52] out her eyes and mixing with his tears
[1:48:55] as it run down the garments and slapped
[1:48:58] on his leg and her leg mixed with the
[1:49:00] Lamb's blood glory to God and you come
[1:49:04] down on that Pillar of Fire and said the
[1:49:07] prophet said you said I can't stand it I
[1:49:10] can't stand it why you didn't want to be
[1:49:14] in Paradise alone right thank you Lord
[1:49:18] what good is a garden if the gardener
[1:49:21] ain't there
[1:49:23] and Adam didn't want to live there by
[1:49:26] hisself that's why he did what he did
[1:49:29] Adam doing what he done forced you to do
[1:49:31] what you did and you knew all along it
[1:49:33] would us being born lost forced you to
[1:49:36] come to the Earth to redeem
[1:49:38] us Oh Glory to
[1:49:41] God but you stopped him and said I
[1:49:45] promise you I'll bring you
[1:49:48] back lord there's people in this
[1:49:50] building that not done horrible things
[1:49:52] there's people stream the service
[1:49:53] they've done horrible things but they
[1:49:54] none of us ever done what Adam
[1:49:57] done and yet your grace is so powerful
[1:50:01] one day the prophet of God said Adam
[1:50:03] will reach over in the resurrection and
[1:50:05] take a hold of Eve Eve will reach over
[1:50:07] and take a hold of Abel able to reach
[1:50:09] over and take a hold of
[1:50:10] Seth and when we get gather together
[1:50:13] there I know we want to meet Samson we
[1:50:15] want to meet Paul we want to meet the
[1:50:17] great Heroes of the Bible but I'll tell
[1:50:18] you I want to meet
[1:50:20] Lord I want to meet Adam
[1:50:26] I want to be

[1:50:54] I'm not trying to cause
[1:50:56] issues but can't you see what God's
[1:50:59] offered us in the message to bring forth
[1:51:03] Christ
[1:51:05] Christ so why would we settle to bring
[1:51:08] forth Reagans or
[1:51:12] colemans or puits or Spencers or Wards
[1:51:17] amen amen how could Eve trade Cain
[1:51:23] for
[1:51:25] Jesus don't condemn her too bad you and
[1:51:29] I have made some of the similar choices
[1:51:30] in our
[1:51:32] lives but God in his Mercy has forgiven
[1:51:35] us thank you Lord let me just say this
[1:51:37] if God's forgiven you you ought to be
[1:51:39] able to forgive

[1:52:36] little bit of that why would you want to
[1:52:38] do that when you can bring forth Christ

[1:58:38] Lord and if we've only been with a
[1:58:40] message preacher and got under their
[1:58:42] influence and we're doing what they say

[1:59:57] got the Holy Ghost and someone can show
[1:59:58] us by the word that we're operating a

[2:03:44] good Sligh and service again here Sunday
[2:03:46] if you want to come back and get slayed
[2:03:48] again I ain't talking about been slayed
[2:03:50] in the spirit I'm talking about the
[2:03:51] sword cut all this evil off of us
[2:03:54] hallelujah let's get that cut off and
[2:03:55] let the spirit slay us what you to
[2:03:59] say praise the Lord I wanted to just
[2:04:03] mention something to you here before I
[2:04:04] let you go um about this uh flood relief
[2:04:09] and things that we're doing and and I'm
[2:04:11] sure that some of you have noticed that
[2:04:12] we're doing things a little bit
[2:04:14] different than we normally do around
[2:04:16] here and that is taking taking pictures
[2:04:19] and documenting a lot of things things
[2:04:21] that we're doing you know how I've been
[2:04:23] through the years I normally don't
[2:04:25] hardly let anybody know what I'm doing
[2:04:27] but let me just share some of the
[2:04:29] reasons why we have people that are
[2:04:32] contributing to our church that are
[2:04:34] business owners that are companies that
[2:04:37] are people that're not even Christians
[2:04:39] many of them of course don't even
[2:04:40] believe the message but they've heard
[2:04:41] about what we're doing and you know they
[2:04:44] don't know us from Adam they don't know
[2:04:46] who we are and we're documenting
[2:04:48] everything when it comes in at the door
[2:04:50] they have somebody there taking a list
[2:04:52] people come in off the street and give
[2:04:53] it they get their name and we just we we
[2:04:56] want to be faithful stewards is that
[2:04:58] right so some of them you know they say
[2:05:00] well could could I see a picture of you
[2:05:02] know would you mind doing that cuz you
[2:05:04] know they don't know who it ain't like
[2:05:06] they're giving 50 cents some of these
[2:05:08] people's given
[2:05:09] $5,000
[2:05:12] $10,000
[2:05:14] $111,000 they don't even know us so I
[2:05:17] have no problem myself with taking
[2:05:19] pictures and been able to give it to
[2:05:21] them but with that you know you're going
[2:05:23] to see a little bit more than you
[2:05:25] normally see so keep in mind we're not
[2:05:27] doing that so people will know it's us
[2:05:30] doing it but some of these people and
[2:05:32] there's other here tonight that know
[2:05:33] that some of the people have even asked
[2:05:35] them could you you know just send us a
[2:05:37] picture of what we're doing so we could
[2:05:39] send pictures back I do the same thing
[2:05:41] whenever we we send money overseas we
[2:05:43] just recently sent some money overseas
[2:05:45] we lifted money for bicycles motorcycles
[2:05:47] to buy a PA system to put concrete in a
[2:05:49] floor in a church so on and so on and so
[2:05:51] on and I tell the brothers there look I
[2:05:53] want pictures I want pictures of the
[2:05:55] brothers that we sent them to I want
[2:05:57] follow-up emails from them brothers I
[2:05:59] just like to make sure that we're being
[2:06:01] held accountable and we're doing it so
[2:06:03] and I share them with you from time to
[2:06:05] time so if you're noticing that and
[2:06:07] you're thinking boy this is a little bit
[2:06:08] strange it's a little bit different it
[2:06:10] is different because whenever we're
[2:06:12] doing it ourself you know how I am I
[2:06:14] don't ask people out here to donate
[2:06:16] Mission funds for the message or
[2:06:18] something like that we do that ourself
[2:06:20] and the majority part of the things we
[2:06:22] have done around the world has been from
[2:06:24] our church we have built churches all
[2:06:26] over the continents of the earth I say
[2:06:29] that by the grace of God ain't Hardy
[2:06:32] nobody knows what we've done and I plan
[2:06:34] on keeping it that way but our church
[2:06:36] did it but this is not just our church
[2:06:39] it's from all kinds of people and
[2:06:41] there's people here in our church that
[2:06:42] are business people and they've asked
[2:06:44] friends of theirs would you like to
[2:06:46] donate or their friends and say do you
[2:06:48] know anybody that we can support and
[2:06:49] they say yeah yeah our church is doing
[2:06:51] this or that and they don't come here so
[2:06:54] they really don't know us so everybody
[2:06:57] understand that I just want to let you
[2:06:58] know so you think wow this is really
[2:07:00] different you know what brother Donnie
[2:07:02] trying to take credit no you know me
[2:07:04] better than that but some of these
[2:07:06] people would just like to see where
[2:07:07] their money is going they want to see it
[2:07:09] I have no problem in sending it to
[2:07:12] them so after this is over we'll revert
[2:07:16] back to normal
[2:07:19] secrecy don't let your left hand know
[2:07:21] what what your right hand's doing but
[2:07:22] you're de with an unbeliever he don't
[2:07:23] necessarily believe that scripture he
[2:07:26] wants to know what his right hand's
[2:07:27] doing so he can see what our left hand
[2:07:29] is doing just to make sure that we're
[2:07:31] honest and legitimate you know you can
[2:07:33] understand them because a lot of them
[2:07:34] are lied to and their money is taken hey
[2:07:36] you know what we have nothing to be
[2:07:38] ashamed of we can be able to document
[2:07:40] everything that we do we'll have
[2:07:41] printouts of all that we do federal
[2:07:43] government wants to come and check us
[2:07:44] come on down Joe if you can find
[2:07:49] us that's right i' why I believe we
[2:07:52] ought to be aren't you as the people of
[2:07:54] God cuz one day we're going to stand
[2:07:56] before the great one and first of all I
[2:07:58] want him to be placed you see when
[2:08:00] people give all this money you know
[2:08:02] who's going to answer for it first
[2:08:05] me me thousands times thousands of
[2:08:09] dollars have come through here in the
[2:08:12] last few
[2:08:13] weeks it ain't going to be brother
[2:08:15] jacket tip's going to answer it's not
[2:08:16] going to be Michael it's not going to be
[2:08:18] the piano player the organ player I've
[2:08:20] got to give an account to God
[2:08:22] and I want to be faithful to
[2:08:24] that amen amen so you know what if we
[2:08:27] handle it right with him shouldn't be a
[2:08:28] problem with anybody else The Infernal
[2:08:30] revenue or whoever else
[2:08:33] amen oh praise the Lord don't you love
[2:08:36] the Lord with all your heart how many's
[2:08:38] happy you come to church tonight am well
[2:08:40] the rest of you I'm sorry you're so
[2:08:41] miserable but we'll be praying for
[2:08:43] you God bless you let's bow our heads
[2:08:47] together Jesus it's such a wonderful joy
[2:08:50] to serve you
[2:08:52] I'm so happy to be a Christian thank so
[2:08:56] happy father we come to a close of a
[2:09:00] service and I pray Lord that you'd help
[2:09:03] us to really consider where we
[2:09:06] are dear God help me as a preacher I I
[2:09:09] wonder sometimes if preachers realize
[2:09:11] how fearful that it
[2:09:14] is you give us an element of influence
[2:09:17] with people you give us favor with
[2:09:20] people yes one day we're going to have
[2:09:22] to answer to you for the favor and what
[2:09:24] we've done with that
[2:09:25] favor because it's evident that when
[2:09:27] some preachers leave the word some
[2:09:29] people will follow them they'll just go
[2:09:31] right there with them that preacher
[2:09:33] don't realize one day he's going to
[2:09:35] stand before you not only give account
[2:09:38] for his own soul but give an account for
[2:09:41] those Souls that he led
[2:09:43] astray dear God I preached to thousands
[2:09:46] times thousands of people the 41
[2:09:50] years I've been preaching this message
[2:09:52] hard to believe in one way but preaching
[2:09:54] this message for 41 years dear God when
[2:09:58] I stand before you I want no man's blood
[2:10:00] on my
[2:10:01] hands I don't never wanted anybody to
[2:10:04] say he split our church he divided our
[2:10:09] congregation and truthfully say I sow
[2:10:12] Discord or truthfully say I added to the
[2:10:15] word oh no God take me off the Earth
[2:10:20] take me to a premat to a grave if you
[2:10:22] have to Lord I don't want to stand
[2:10:24] before you that day with men's blood on
[2:10:26] my hands but I want to stand there Lord
[2:10:29] and look back behind me and there will
[2:10:31] be the saints of God that I've LED
[2:10:33] through life we'll be gathered under our
[2:10:36] Prophet messenger of the age Paul will
[2:10:38] present his group on down on down to the
[2:10:41] seventh age up who walk Elijah will be
[2:10:44] like a mighty Army that will be the
[2:10:47] commander that'll stand there the
[2:10:48] prophet of the age then there'll be the
[2:10:50] different Bri AES as it were the
[2:10:53] colonels the generals back there at the
[2:10:55] end will be a tater peeler that'll be me
[2:10:57] with our little tater peelers we're the
[2:11:00] Tater peeler Brigade but that's all
[2:11:02] right you need taters when you're hungry
[2:11:05] Lord we want to stand over that Great
[2:11:06] Mighty Army that day we'll watch them
[2:11:09] great people as they get their rewards
[2:11:11] and we'll stand there and rejoice and
[2:11:13] scream and holler glory to God we may
[2:11:16] not get the reward that others get but
[2:11:19] Lord we will just be so happy to be
[2:11:21] there oh Hallelujah May there not be a
[2:11:24] one here tonight absent on that day keep
[2:11:27] us by your grace I pray father in the
[2:11:30] name of the Lord Jesus we ask it amen
