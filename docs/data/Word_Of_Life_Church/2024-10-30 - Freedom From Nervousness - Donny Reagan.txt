many believes [Music] it he's got it all in control thank you Lord in my soul in my soul he's got it all in control praise the Lord I'm glad we serve such a mighty God tonight let us turn if you would to book of Psalms chapter 42 please verse 5 Psalms 42 verse 5 I want to speak to you tonight on freedom from nervousness all right freedom from nervousness Psalm 425 why art thou cast down oh my soul why art thou disquieted in me look at the meaning of this word to murmur growl Roar cry aloud mourn rage sound make noise be clamorous being an uproar have I covered everybody yet being an uproar to be in a stir be in a commotion or be tur turbulent wow why art thou disqui in me hope thou in God for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance so you can imagine now the psalmist David one of the men that if anybody knew the key of praise it was him but he reached a spot in his life where he couldn't praise like he could before notice how he words this for he said I shall yet praise him right now I'm at the spot that I'm struggling trying to do it he said but I will I will I love that attitude don't you for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance oh my God my soul is cast down Within Me therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan and from of the hermit and from the hill of myar I don't have a clue where that was on the entire face of the Earth cuz that was the only place place in the Bible I could ever even find that name so I don't know where David was even at but look where his where his soul is he's just so cast down in Psalm 61:2 from the end of the Earth will I cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed yes sir Glory yes sir look at the meaning of this word to envelop oneself so you mean there's things we actually self-inflict we do to ourself so when my heart is overwhelmed to envelop oneself to be feeble be faint grow weak again be faint to show feebleness and then to faint away when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I for thou Hast been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy I love verse four I will abide in thy Tabernacle forever I will trust in the covert of thy Wings sah praise the Lord I mean like to be remembered tonight in prayer praise the Lord I was just rejoicing as I heard Brother Louie um sharing the different testimonies and um sister Brenda how the Lord had moveed for her and I thought my goodness through prayer she was able to sleep 14 hours I think I need to start praying for myself maybe not 14 but eight would be nice but I I just want to say that I've heard so many wonderful deliverances from the service right here Wednesday night from people all over everywhere it shows us that our God is mindful of us is he not so whatever our needs are tonight let's just hold them there before the Lord Heavenly Father we've gathered here again tonight to see your Mighty power on display father the way we understand it you're just as much a God on Wednesday night as you are on Sunday morning or any other day out of the week Lord we Rejoice for what we saw you do here Wednesday and there will still be others that will recognize that thing that has tormented them has left them it might be a few days might even be a week or so before they realize it and one day it'll just come to them and they'll think I'm not even feeling the way I did before so Lord God we open our hearts to your word tonight would you speak to us father we have many needs and we know that our God is mindful of each of them help me Lord Jesus I pray help the people to be able to pull and help me to be able to be submissive to that I pray father speak to us from your great word it's in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it and the Saints said amen amen God bless you you may be seated and I think one of the greatest the worst things that can happen to us is that when Satan goes to putting things on us whether it's physical whether it's spiritual whatever it is that we begin to accept those things and just believe that this is the new norm and I have to remain this way well I guess I'm getting old so getting older you know they say that nervousness comes with it and where does the bible say that because you get old that you got to be nervous where does the bible say that well you know blood pressure run in your family but wait a minute I thought I'm born of another family so I'm afraid that many times the things that we sign for is nothing but the devil that's trying to get us to compromise on what God has already done for us as his children and for us to just accept it because the devil sends it upon us it makes no sense to me because our lord Jesus has already suffered Stripes so that we could be healed the chastisement of my peace was put upon him so why should he go through that chastisement and then me go through torment of something he's already paid the price for I mean somebody help me to understand that tonight if he's already paid the price why shouldn't I enjoy the full benefit of what I am as a son or you as a son and daughter of God is that right now I want you to notice here in Psalm 143 that David said for the enemy has persecuted my soul he has smitten my life down to the ground he has made me to dwell in darkness as those that have been long dead now they didn't know very much about the grave and they certainly didn't know very much about death by the time this was written and they they used one of the Hebrew words that was sheld which was a place of Darkness so they wasn't really sure where a man went but all they knew was that the body life had left it and they were in a world that they were not aware of so they throw dirt in the face or they put them in a rock tomb and they would put the rock face over the top of it and it was dark so they just assumed by that that wherever it was that the spiritual part went that it was in a place of darkness and David had found himself spiritually yet alive but feeling as if though he had entered into some type of Darkness now let me start this tonight by this saying that when God made the angels of God that God made them each one a little bit different now they were created in hierarchy they were created where they would have a particular position in the powers that they were partakers of so there were seraphim there was zoons there was cherubims there was different classes of angels there were elect angels and then there were angels that were actually created and they were created and put in a period of probation probation now father knew what those angels would do what they would do but remember they were not elect Angels but they were angels that were created out of this element of time because father knew the way they would go now they know were not made like you and I was s in them but they were born or created where with the capability to choose wrong and that way they were put in a probationary time that they could choose what they wanted to do so we can see the attributes of these angels after they fell that they had different makeups or characters or traits about them so when Satan needed then these beings that would help him carry out what he wanted to do he could not create demons he could not create Fallen Angels so he had to take what God had created and tried to pull them away from their original position in God now they were made where they could fall the non-elect were they were made where they could fall so they could fall from their original estate then when they fell they were put in to a realm of everlasting chains of Darkness now they can move about in the fourth dimension they can go down to the regions of the lost they can still actually have an access Up Before the Throne of God remember whenever Micaiah the prophet saw and there was an evil spirit that went Before the Throne of God and said if you will let me I will go down there and become a lying spirit in the mouths of them prophets and he said how will you do this and he told him he said go so father allowed now an angel of God could never have done this but this Fallen Angel which had still obtained a position of hierarchy he was be able to submit what he was now keep this in mind that when country music people many of them as you know started out in church Elvis Presley shouted in the Assembly of God when he backslid he did not lose his ability to sing so at one time he shouted and danced in the Assembly of God Church so he took that dance on Coliseum floors and stages and auditoriums and started shaking his leg and drove people absolutely crazy with it now what did he do he learned that as a Young Man shouting in an Assembly of God Church and he took his ability to sing anointed by God turned it over to the devil and sold his soul out to hell is that right now he had something from God an ability an anointing and yet none of that for any mortal that's ever been all of those that we could name that many of them started out in church and yet they sold out their ability to the devil but no mortal could ever compare to what one of these angels would have had in so much that the Bible called it an estate now we think of an estate as a home and acres and maybe whatever your idea an estate would be you know somewhere where they'd have Rolling Hills and and a beautiful white fence and you know if you're a horse person horses all over if you're an Angus person or you know whatever you are you got that in your mind but Angels had an estate as well so an estate would have been a declared Portion by which they were given a part of that once they forfeited that then the estate was taken from them and they were put into chains of everlasting Darkness res deserved until the time of their punishment but they have access by the fourth dimension to be able to come back and forth so they can appear they can disappear Satan himself still has the ability to transform himself and appear as an angel of Light so he is the king of demons but he can make himself appear as an angel of Light so he could appear and take on an image that would look like Jesus Christ is that right oh sure don't you remember St Martin whenever he appeared to him and told him he said don't you know me Martin I'm the Lord Jesus now you talking about the king of Hypocrites that he would come to St Martin and say don't you know me I'm Jesus your savior why nothing but a balac liar but what did he want he once worshiped so bad that he would appear in the name of Jesus and try to get one of God's servants to worship him because he wants to be praised that desperately but this prophet of course recognized him and identified him by the word so whenever the prophet now preaches about demonology now whenever you read the little book there called demonology part of it was actually preached in Connorsville IND the in 1953 part one part two and then enticing Spirits which was preached in 1955 which was preached a couple years later in Jeffersonville and then they put it together and they entitled it the demonology series uh the prophet goes into it about demons and gives us a view into the realm of what they are like for our first time we have a glimpse of what they really were how they worked even their appearance sometime sometimes like hair hanging off their legs others like a a tortoise shell with legs hanging up and others would be of a vapor of of a darkness of a stream whatever they were and yet some of them were sent more or less to in the political realm well they they they really have a big time in election year don't they yeah they really do and that's what anoints all these politicians to tell all these lies and I'll tell you why people believes them because many people get under that political spirit and then the leader of their party whoever it is Republican or Democrat because the devil owns both of them and controls from the majority of both sides so that demon then on the Democrat Party will anoint their main person and then all their spokesmen and they'll get all the people all riled up and then the demon on the Republican party will get them all riled up and they'll make all these promises knowing that there's no way they can even do it anyway some of the things both sides are promising us right now neither of them have the power nor the authority to do what they are saying because Congress will have to do part of it the Senate will have to do part of it come on don't get quiet on me now you know it's the truth but why is it that people believe them why why because people get under that anointing and that lying political demon will get on that spokesperson and they'll get in these big rallies and they'll hoop and holler and this and that and the other and my goodness within six months or a year a lot of them promises are made people forget about it they don't even expect them to do it why that demonic thing that was on them has totally backed off of them now and they don't even hold that politician to their promise but you see the anointing of the Holy Ghost when it falls on a Believer and anoints a man of God to preach the word or anoints you as you're listening to a tape from the prophet of God the spirit of God will hold God accountable to his promise in your heart and the spirit of God in you will never let one word of God ever fall to the ground and you'll remind God every day if you have to until God brings that to pass why because you're not Anointed with a lying Spirit now if you're knowing with a lying spirit and a lying spirit will let you hear that promise and then you'll forget about it oh well God can't do it God ain't got the power to do it that shows you we not under the anointing of the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost once he quickens the word to you that word is yours for eternity and you will in your soul never let God go you'll be on his hands from the time you hear that word until it's manifested in your life so when God made these angels I don't believe every one of them are exactly alike no more than we are and the prophet tells us actually in heaven when we all get there that we're not all going to be the same there'll be red heads blackheads blondes there'll be all kinds of different people all different kinds of people with skin colors that are different because God is the god of variety well you can watch these angels now and if you'll see them categorically when they are manifested in the fourth dimension how that they will have a certain effect on people's lives now I not only study the message from the doctrinal point but also study it from the point of discernment because nowhere else in the Bible do we get a PE a peer open Vision in into the realm of the way these demons acted and the way they talked and the way they behaved now we get a few examples of course in the New Testament where they would talk and say things outright but yet in this last day we have even a greater Vision because it was actually the ministry of the Lord Jesus himself reincarnated in his church in the last days is that right that's why the prophet of God could say it I'm going go ahead and say it tonight it chokes some people Absol his death but he said the Lord Jesus had more success in his ministry than he did his own well if you understand that you should be able to say Amen the Lord Jesus had more success in Jeffersonville than he did in Jerusalem the Lord Jesus had more success in Jeffersonville than he did Nazareth praise the Lord I did say the Lord Jesus not brother Brandon because it was the Lord Jes Jesus using his Prophet at the returning of the son of man of Luke 17:30 now he chose to do that himself so we're able to see then into that realm how that these things manifest themselves so when we look at anxieties we looked at it the other night and we looked at oppression and depression and some of these things are very very similar but yet they still have a differentiation about them and you can see by the discernment and as I said I will study the discernments and watch them as they start back in 1947 and then go on down right to the end of 65 and you will watch people that are called out in different states and different time zones different years and you will see similarities of the way this demon would make them out now for instance say a person that would have a nervous demon on them and I found it over and over over again that it would hit them for the most part the worst time of the day would be in the evening time and that nervous demon also it would make them shaky depending on whether it was an internal nervousness or what he called a a mental nervousness and they would over and over again by discernment whether there a man or woman he would tell them I see you you dropped a cup or you dropped a glass or you drop a saucer now he would see them nine times out of 10 he would see them standing up and he would see them get really weak and watching them shake and then they would drop something then whenever they would drop something then a weakness would actually hit them now depending on which type that it was whether it was in the psyche or whether it was in the nerves which runs through the body itself the reaction would be a little bit different now you realize when you're looking at that that you're looking at a family trait in the world of demons so then these demons that couldn't be the main the same one that would be able to affect people all over the world and people that would be in Oakland California somebody be in Phoenix somebody be at the indicot shoe Auditorium in New York and yet the same thing would be this similar attribute over and over again so Satan then coupled or grou pooped these demons with certain makeup that would be very suitable for this type of disease that disease that disease that disease and they would also be able to communicate one with the other uh political Devils they are jealous of one another and they love to fight Victory Day 1963 uh you can find the prophet saying that that that's what causes Wars because the spirit of one nation gets jealous of another together so the war in Ukraine and Russia and all that that's been going going on now for quite some time so the spirit of Russia got jealous of the spirit of Ukraine then they begin to anoint the leaders and the leaders got into the this big turmoil and that's what's going on now whenever we look at the wars and we look at the dictators and so on this men that there's demons that are chosen for certain powers remember when Daniel had prayed and he prayed and waited and waited and he he couldn't understand what in the world was going on finally the angel of God came down and said oh Daniel greatly beloved to the Lord your prayer was heard from the first day and then here it's 21 days later but now the angel gives him an Insight of what was going on so the angel of God ascended down over the kingdom of Persia because now Persia was the ruling power Gentile power and this demon the Kings would say or the potentate over the domain of Persia had hindered the angel of God from coming down to Daniel now can you imagine it was a fallen angel but he still had a hierarchy that was a little bit higher than an angel which had not Fallen now listen friends if an angel of God could not break through a demonic power I'm telling you tonight you and I cannot do it on our own it takes the Holy Ghost to help us well come on somebody and sometimes it will take even more than just you having the Holy Ghost sometimes you need other people to pray with you or you might need a man of God to cast that thing away from you now he gives Daniel an Insight of what was going on so he's wrestling with that angel Now find that this angel that was sent from heaven could not break through so what happened a noted Angel which was Michael Michael came down and actually delivered this other holy righteous sinless Angel and he started dealing with this Prince of Persia and when he did then this Angel was allowed to go down to Daniel and give him his message now this Angel then turns after he delivers the message to Daniel he said lo I must return and fight with the prince of grea now remember the kingdom of Greece is going to be the Greek part of the vision or the dream that Nebuchadnezzar had you remember the four Gentile Kingdoms in the image so it was not the same demon that was over Persia but it was another demon which had been chosen because apparently his traits his characteristics would match more the anointing that was needed to be able to do what God saw would be done oh I hope somebody Shar me tonight you see it's the same way in the church ages so God released a certain power in the days of the martyrs in the first church age and then we go to the second horse rider and the third and then on down what did we need we did not need a martyr anointing we did not need the lion anointing but we needed an eagle anointing so we receive what God sends us and we work under that anointing it's the same way with the kingdoms of Darkness on the other side they must have an anointing now remember in the last days that Satan's Chief demon will come upon the Earth and will actually in inhabit the body of the Antichrist before the bride goes up there will be this inhabitants that will live inside Satan's main ruler until Satan when the bride goes up and the Devil comes down then that head demon will be booted out and Satan himself will step in now think about in the world in the realm of demonology when it comes to sickness and disease there were certain adjectives that the prophet would use to describe certain Devils some of them were horrible some of them were terrible some of them the words that he would use were spooky or it would be shaky it would cause the person that it was affecting to be shaky with many of them when it would come to nervousness it would be it was about to drive them out of their mind and they would be thinking things that were contrary to them themselves and if they were Christians of course it was Saints contrary to the word of God now for those of you tonight that have never been maybe in a nervous breakdown or under a real nervous type of demon it might be easy for you to criticize someone who's working under that and this is something that I found repeated over and over again that brother brandham would by discernment would tell different people that people have told you to get next to yourself right but you can't he said so it was amazing that again it reoccurred over and over again so it was out of this family more than likely wasn't the same demon but it was demons that were of a spirit so they would get on this person that one that one that one that one and their family their loved ones maybe their Pastor whoever was said brother you've got to get next to yourself sister you've got to get next to yourself Shake yourself out of that and yet the prophet did not rebuke them he would tell them they couldn't do it yeah now remember there's a difference between being nervous and having a nervous demon come on all of us can get nervous at times praise the lord we can be nervous about this or that or whatever but yet whenever that certain occasion will stop or change then our nerves calm down and we're able to reach an element of normaly again but if a person is Anointed with a demon they cannot make their s come to their senses they cannot with their own power cause this thing to leave they cannot with their own power make theirself of a sound mind right amen if there's anybody left here tonight in the building that's still fighting this if you'll believe it while I'm preaching you can be delivered right now amen for he sent his word and healed them amen but to the person who is dealing with it it's you know oppression and depression and some of these things can be very very similar but what's amazing is that a Prophet by discernment can be able to go in and be able to divide and separate things where a CT scan and MRI whatever would never never be able to touch it now I want you to notice this that this one here the angel of God well now here's what happens she gets real nervous spells but mainly a mental psychic condition see feeling she gets worried at first it's like an old piece of you feel like you're going to lose your mind isn't that that the way you've been feeling there's something haunting haunting listen there's something haunting this lady that makes her feel that way but now it's lifted it's gone the lady can go home and be normal now notice go on your road Rejoice just start praising God and thank you dear God all that gloomy feeling will be gone now as of this present tense when this discernment is unfolding the demon had left but he left a remnant of this feeling that was still there now listen people will then go and say well I felt better a little bit I felt a little bit better but that but that feeling is not gone and and I must not be no better don't you go that way friends that thing will try its best to come back now I want you to notice in several of these that we're going to look at tonight that that God many times would tell the people that they would have to do certain things to make their healing complete I want you to watch what he tells this individual now now you go on your road and rejoice but this individual is still feeling gloomy how do you rejoice when you're gloomy you rejoice over the top of it that's right you praise over the top of it you sing over the top of it you preach don't we preachers over the top of being gloomy now watch in Mark 2:1 but that you may not that the son of man have power on Earth to forgive sins for he saith to the sick of the PCY I say unto thee arise and take up thy bed and go thy way un thine house now the Lord Jesus has already done something but Lance what if this man would have laid there what if this man would have laid there and said I'm not going to do it's on the Sabbath day I can't do that I'm tired I I don't have my strengths back yet I I don't want to cause no trouble if he had not obeyed the Lord let me tell you why some people lose their healing they don't do what they're instructed to do praise the Lord I say unto thee arise and take up thy bed and go thy way into thy house and immediate ly he arose took up the bed and went Force before them all in so much that they were all amazed and glorified God so when did the manifestation of the miraculous happen when the natural be to move the Supernatural come in and Anointed The Natural so but of course we always want God to move supernaturally first I wonder would this miracle have happened happened had this man not put forth an effort oh my my and they glorified God saying we never saw it on this fashion I guarantee you they didn't notice again in John chapter 9 verse six when he had thus spoken he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and he Anointed The Eyes of the blind man with the clay and said unto him go go wash in the of Silo which is by interpretation said he went his way therefore and washed and came seeing remember he was not seeing when he left I wonder if the reason we've missed some of our Miracles is because we didn't obey come on and the man of God go brother believe praise him with all your heart and yet you don't do that I said well brother Dy Pray For Me Brother D pray brother Joel Brown these other brothers they pray for me I I didn't get nothing did you do what they told you to do he did not leave brother John seeing immediately the man was not only blind he had mud in his eyes how would you like if somebody spit on the ground that certainly wouldn't be sanitary would it and they spit on the ground and make up oh my and make a mess and rub it on your face and say go to the pool of salom are you kidding me I ain't got no GPS I don't know where it's even at am I going to get there I don't know how to get there but you know what that man may have stumbled along and he may have pressed through all the people life and look at him why poor old God that preacher rubbed M spit and the dirt and rubbed it on his eyes and look at him he's doing it no doubt that have called him a cult follower that have said the man has lost his mind but I like what the Bible said he come back see life at me ricu me but one day you'll say he come back changed Oh Glory to God thank you Lord Jesus M John 11:9 Jesus said take ye away the stone Martha the sister of Martha the sister of him that was dead said unto him Lord by this time he stinketh for he's now been dead 4 days would the miracle have happened if they would have said there's no way it'll make a mess if I do this everybody's going to life of a suanti you be terrible you imagine now the temperatures the way they are there and a body being laying out for 4 days in a place like that it would have been absolutely horrific but they did as he said and the resurrection came came after they did their part the resurrection did not come first but after they obeyed his word praise be to God now let's let's get into a little combat here thou demon tormenting his life in the name of Jesus Christ the son of God come out of the man now look here sir it's gone now you're free you go out of here now listen you go out of here testifying you feel all right now question fine the man

every word true now I will tell you what will be the results in the coming future Glory go out to he happy singing it didn't make no difference if this man couldn't carry a tune in a lard bucket if a

for my healing and just keep on like that you'll get well you see this woman was not yet well even though the discernment had discerned her yes sir part of her healing is going to be her working with God and don't you see what God wants to do God wants to get this out of the woman no doubt a real daughter of God a real sincere person and the way that the prophet is dealing with her hey God wants to help her he wants to help her grow up he wants to help her get past this stage that she's going by her feeling you can tell the woman really had some issue by the way she's looking at I mean my you do talking about being bold that a prophet of God would discern you and you're going right back at him well what am I supposed to do when I feel like dying all the time is there woman got here M so she needed some adjustment well praise the Lord I'm glad our God still adjusts on you oh my thank God from my healing so you just keep on like that you'll get well you see what I mean that's where you climb up over the riffles there it's a battle you got to fight before you had the victory you see Lord Jesus bless this woman who I lay hands on and say to this evil spirit you're exposed God rebuke thee in the name of his son Christ Jesus May thou leave the woman come out of her and may she go and be well God in heaven Grant the blessing through Christ Jesus name raise up your feet now and say thank you Lord raise up my hands and say thank you Lord thank you Lord now I'm feeling fine see that's it go on off the pl form walk on yourself stand there sometimes evil spirits want to hold on it's left the people's it's left to the people's face they have to leave in the presence that's true but when they get away they'll return what's he giving them something something to fight when it comes back oh Lord have mercy Brother Don you mean that thing may try to come back sure he may try to come out oh my goodness but you you and the brothers prayed for me y' y'all are anointed to do that you're anointed but but I'm not anointed to cast that out you're not casting it out you're just keeping it away from the door coming back in So if somebody come into your house Sister Sarah knocking on the door and they want to break in and take everything y'all got in your house you're going to just open the door y'all come on and you probably grab the M the broom your gun your water pistol whatever you got get out of here this is our house you got your phone in one and you got a broom in another hand hit them with a dust pop you pick up a table lamp knock them across the head why because that's your house that's your house your family lives there this is your place well let me say tonight this is your house this is your body God gave it to you and when nervousness tries to take it over hit it with a lamp knock it in the head get you a case of bottle water after church bombard that Devil with bottle water get on back to hell devil get all back to hell this is my [Applause] house hallelu but when they get away they'll return you see but if the patient can have enough Faith to take it the thing away itself much better now watch let's take the cover off this nervous demon yes that's that's very scary you get real nervous spells I seen you you dropped a dish something another trying in your hand you couldn't hold it isn't that right yes I see you stand by the sink it was amazing how many of these that I found that they were standing by a sink now I make the offer once again for those of you who have left the message there's some of them still like to stream because they love to pick what I preach I'll make the offer to any of you who have left this word I want to call our Prophet a lar and hypocrite I want one of your ranks of the believe the sign mess one of your ranks one yes come and do the same thing put up or shut up I don't want words let God prove who's right woo I love getting a devil in a corner like this my I feel like I'm about 10t tall and 7 and 1/2 ft wide woo glory to God hallelujah watch this you you kind of staggered over it in the evening when the Sun is setting I I see it makes you feel real worn and tired in the evening I see you sitting around a whole lot at that time looking out of window kind of looking like it was dreary and weary you have narus also so that devil must just kind of raised up his head and said I saw you too so I'll go aead and call your name narus go Lord have mercy you can't even move around him you want to tell me the greatest Prophet that ever lived on the Earth was a false one if our God cannot outperform the devil we better stop serving it's amazing how many YouTube videos are surfacing out here in the charismatic and Pentecostal World a preacher after another one after another after another talking about brother brandom's prophecies talking about brother brandom's anointing talking about the great signs and the Elijah this and the Elijah that of course the thing they don't like is his Doctrine they say he got off where we say he got off is where we got on oh yeah he was a great prophet boy I tell you one thing when he was under the anointing man alive he had call people out and tell him this and that and other but boy watch his Doctrine yeah that's the same thing they said about Jesus well come on somebody but the very thing they say where he got off of to us is the mystery of God the signs and the Wonders was nothing but bait on the hook it started out fishing with a little bitty old thing but it got bigger and then the LI pole was rainbow trout that's what I am tonight I ain't no goldfish swimming down in the bottle of Christianity I ain't no eel swimming down the bottle of Christianity I'm a real rainbow trial I've got a covenant of the almighty God down in my soul glory to God [Applause] hallelujah oh my what that is Lady it's the time of your life it's menopause change of Life come here do you believe that Jesus Christ Christ can take that from you will you submit yourself to him it's a horrible Spirit it just HTS at you jump on down in that paragraph now Satan would run you insane if he could but God's going to take it off of you Hallelujah now and he's going to make you well my kind heavenly father in the name of thy son Jesus may this demon leave the woman may she walk through these Shadows without a fear in her heart notice now may she walk through these Shadows without a fear in her heart is it amazing the spirit of God is didn't always immediately take all of it away God's got a point he's trying to prove he wants to prove to the devil there some of my children I'll have them pray for and they'll believe me they don't feel better but they're still confessing the word they don't feel one bit better than they did the night before but their confession is by his stripes I am healed they may be worse the next day the next week and two weeks after that but they still trust me may she walk through these Shadows without a fear in her heart leave her come out of her in Jesus name now listen friends I don't mind telling you I've dealt with demons the entirety of my Ministry even when I was in Pentecost I don't like them I'd best rather hang out with angels but yet we realize that in this Warfare that we're in Satan wants to hide him himself mhm but this word exposes him what's this lady standing before me is a Christian She's suffering with a blood pressure she's really nervous she's got a gallbladder trouble and nervous upset brings her to a blood pressure and there's something strange about you you you've accepted your healing once before four on the same thing but you got too Hy with it wow so you mean a person after they're healed they got to be careful with their attitude I thought this was absolutely amazing I don't remember ever ran across this until the other day you accepted your healing once before in the same thing but you got too bodyy with it like and got away and by the way you're a missionary or you've been a missionary I see another man and that's your husband he's a Pentecostal preacher he was a Pentecostal preacher but is in glory isn't it amazing how dimensional travel can reflect itself through eyes that are dimensional so I see this man he was past since Pentecostal preacher but he's in glory glory you're still you got something in your mind you're trying to figure out what you must do with the rest of your life again the invitation is open come on believe the signers show up show us your signs come on you cowardly preachers that pulled away you bunch of chicken hearted if God's with you let God testify of you may God have mercy on your soul may you find repentance woo that's all right make another YouTube video of me I don't care God's making one of this one tonight and I'll Stand in the day of judgment against you're trying to figure out what you must do with the rest of your life and you're trying to make a decision and you feel that you're to go East out here toward the eastern states to finish Lord have mercy yeah this is prophecy brother sister it's not yeah the Lord say I'm here and I'm good and I'm here to bless you and I'm here to do this this is the kind of God I'm talking about this is the kind of gifts I want to see in our church uhhuh and the prophet of God said that there was tongues and interpretation in his church and he said it would actually help his gift because in tongues an interpretation is like a church reflection of a prophet's discernment uhhuh that's exactly what real tongues and interpretation is he said it would lighten his burden so tongues and interpretation in the church was yeah I say the Lord I'm here and I'm going to bless you and didn't I say I bless you all and didn't I say no it's actually Oh Glory to God it's the church the spirit of the Living God speaking out in the same way that it did out of our older brother well glory to God it's the same Holy Ghost through these gifts manifesting himself well come on somebody oh you say that ain't Bible I beg your pardon it is a Bible Paul said in the book of Corinthians if someone would come in and they would tell about the secret of their heart would not they say God is with you you'd think I'd be old enough now to know that these things are going to get me in trouble but I'm also old enough to say if I don't say them they're going to get me in worse trouble I think I'll pick the Lesser trouble notice this that's thus sayith the Lord what he said is that the truth is it now there's one thing about it when he says anything it's always right what he said is that the truth is it that wasn't me that was him every word true it always is I go on your road rejoicing and the sister says I had doubts about my healing and I lost it I want you to notice how he comes back and says go be humble and sweet isn't it amazing friends that a person could be healed by God and become Hy and arrogant notice the last words of advice aren't go shout go jump go scream go holler be humble and sweet why apparently there's something about her makeup that it may come against her again and he's giving her the prescription she needs the humble woo can I have a few more minutes thankk you come lady he would like to make you believe you're going to lose your mind the sister Cries Out does that sound like somebody like you that was acting people that have said in our own church have said these discernments were put on and that people acted if you'll listen to this woman you'll hear this ain't no act Glory he's been telling you that but he's a liar you're free now and she said oh God go home and rejoice Jesus Christ makes you Hallelujah free listen at her again oh oh oh Jesus Jesus Jesus Hallelujah glory to God believe God can heal that stomach trouble and make you well go on your road rejoicing saying thank you Lord Jesus come lady same thing don't you let him tell you that it's a nervous condition and you believe God's going to make you well tonight it's your only hope of doing it start on your road rejoicing happy and smiling brother Donnie I cannot put on a fake smile don't you tell me that you life at all kinds of people's jokes it's as corny as they can be you life at sometimes your friends say things that ain't a bit more funny than nothing and you'll put on this big earto ear smile and you'll in and you're thinking what in the world is they saying I don't have a clue I don't have a clue what they talking about I don't have a clue what they're saying if you can smile for a stupid joke if you can smile for somebody cuz you don't want to hurt their feelings you need to pull out that smile Hallelujah for the devil and say I'm Healed by Stripes by his stripes I'm Healed and you are defeated devil but he wants you to turn that smile upside down and frown in the morning I'm frowned at 10:00 I'm frowned at the noon time but you need to start smiling the devil say good Lord what in the world's going on Hallelujah but you see a person can be in such a state with a nervous thing that they're almost out of their mind and they know they should do this and this and this and they should Shake yourself out of it and they know they should but it's like they can't First Kings chapter 19 verse1 and Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done and was all how he had slain all the prophets with the sword and Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time and when he saw that he arose and went for his life you imagine a prophet of God that just killed 450 false prophets and runs from one denominational Church the old mother why the anointing had left him he's all geared up now on the anointing oh Hallelujah glory to God you false prophet you let me call fire down that I'll tell you one thing God's God hallelujah and she said you're as good as a dead man I'll have your life by tomorrow said oh Lord oh Lord have mercy I'm quitting L on and I can't go back oh no Lord have mercy you imagine people look I said that's the prophet of the age that's the man of God when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to berseba which belongs into Judah left his servant there but he himself won a Day's Journey in the wilderness so remember he's all by himself now which is the worst place you can be in such a situation and came and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die he did not want to live another day a young sister just a few days ago having had a baby a while back went through this depression as some mothers can do took her life maybe her husband didn't know maybe her pastor didn't know other there people in the church family message girl love God real Christian but you say it's so easy for us if we we've never experienced this to point our finger I've never been here either okay I've never been here I've never felt like this before but I've dealt with thousands of people who have so I've had experience even though I've not dealt with it myself so it's easy for us to point our finger but be careful for the same judgment that you judge others hopefully that thing won't come back to you so the best thing for you to do is pray for people I don't understand why they're that way I don't understand but God you you help them you help them Lord oh my but he went a Day's Journey to the Wilderness and came and said under a generry and requested for himself that he might die and said it is enough which means much many great abounding great strong exceedingly I take no more now oh Lord take away my life for I am not better than my fathers do you know what happened to Elijah under the juniper tree the prophet of God had a nervous breakdown a prophet of God God had a nervous break him so if you would have been there would you have told hey get next to yourself we need you we need you you're preached into to us what in the world's a matter with you I thought you was a great Mighty Man Elijah that great oh my that great God God call man God what in the world a man you're crying and feeling sorry for yourself you even said things that wasn't true you said you was the only one left that was not true God let him know that said I've got 7,000 a B their KN to Bell you see when a person enters into a spot like this they will say things they will do things that's not even real it's not even true but it's so real to them why the personality of that demon is affecting their own don't you understand what demons want to do project their personality to where it will encapsulate that person and change them and their husband knows they're different their wife whatever it is they're their children their grandchildren they know what's wrong with what's wrong with Mama what's wrong with sister so and so what's wrong something ain't right something a right what is it he's not the S he's not himself anymore it's Dem if you're under the sound of my voice tonight whether it's visible are invisible it's time for you to get under the personality of another person the Lord Jesus notice the prophet said immediately after Elijah's Ministry with the Jezebel all the people trying to pattern after her and everything he must have rammed and cut that gospel in there that day finally after you had done prove God God come down to vindicate there was God then he had a nervous breakdown he went out and sat under the Juniper train wanted to die and prayed for God to take his life 40 days and 40 nights he was out there in the wilderness wandering around and God found him pulled back in a cave somewhere brother Dave I imagine it was one pitiful s can you imagine if any new reporters would have been able to been out there brother Steve and watch him walking around and crying and going on that said oh boy boy I can't wait to get back man I can't wait to get back snap snap snap snap oh W yeah I I

there ain't no church age Prophet on the earth we're only promised a discernment like that one in an age and the church said one in an age but I'll tell you what the same Lord Jesus is right here tonight and the Bible tells me that the word is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart he know what you prayed before church he know what you prayed last night by your bed he knew what you prayed when you come in and sit down right there in that Pew God I need your help tonight like never before he heard your prayer too and he's just as concerned about you as he was that woman that thing is over the audience that little lady sitting there a Bible teacher setting there suffering with the same thing the devil's lying to you lady you're ready to be delivered look there all over the building here everywhere here sets on another one right there there's another one right Yonder here's one every one of you with nervous trouble stand up on your feet just a minute if you will stand to your feet bow your head everybody Satan you evil spirit you're exposed come out of these people I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ leave these people come out look now lady just a minute you're free it's all gone from you every one of you is healed the whole group of you is healed I would like to be at the Main Gate of Hell that night wouldn't you and you had have watch them demons come all cripping in and here com other and said you must have been at the same meeting that I said Lord have mercy Ain never been so whooped and so wore out in my life what in the world's that man God oh Lord go down until tell the devil we're in for it yeah well let me tell you again tonight devil that Prophet ain't here but the Lord Jesus is hallelujah the Lord Jesus is still here and is mindful of the needs of his [Applause] children Brothers just skip down to that leading of the spirit of God in cville that little lady setting right there the second one right and back there she's bothered with nervousness too is that right lady see what I mean this demon knows if that woman well halfway [Laughter] believe Highway scares Devils to death [Laughter] I feel like talking in tongues Oh Glory this demon knows if that woman will have way believe that Jesus Christ the son of God and I'm his Prophet so the Devils believed he was a prophet that makes you pretty stupid if you don't that makes you pretty ignorant if you don't amen glory let me enjoy the Elijah anointing while I'm feeling it tonight listen this demon knows that the woman will halfway believe that Jesus Christ the son of God and I'm his Prophet it'll have to leave her that demon was calling to that one for help you know what's sad sometimes demons are smarter than Christians Christians can get so low and so despondent and instead of reaching out to your pastor reaching out to another Christian you miss church and you stay away and you pull away from the rest at least demons have got enough sense to say help me help me that demon was calling to that one for help for help to accumulate unbelief but he's lost the battle Sher has faith is gathering faith is together that's why you don't want to go through a battle by yourself the Bible said bear one another's burdens reach out to a friend reach out to a minister reach out to a deacon somebody you got confidence in what will it do it will accumulate more faith amen accumulate more faith it'll help you I do friends as a minister I do why because sometimes you get to a spot you think you just can't make it you need somebody to stand with you to accumulate more faith [Applause] very nervous upset you're bothered it's about somebody else too it's a man that man's a soldier being a soldier he's a veteran of the war it's a mental trouble it's your husband's brother your brother-in-law your husband has a habit too uhhuh this is not our 2024 generic discernment is it so it can tell you about you it can tell you about your husband it can tell you about your brother-in-law it can even show habits uh oh praise the Lord you can see why the devil wants to get us to take a substitute gift uhhuh generic stuff that hits and miss and hits and he don't want this kind in the church amen he don't want this kind that'll be able to speak in tongues and interpret and call somebody out for sinning call her fooling around with somebody else's wife or fooling around with somebody who I think I'm going to preach now fing around with somebody else's husband or maybe call out a deacon for this or that or the other and maybe a preacher for this that the other that's the kind of gifts I want ameno your husband has a habit too that he ought to quit smoking don't fear sister have faith in God come here for the blessing I lay my hands upon this my sister Satan you evil selfish ungodly spirit I challenge you in the name of Jesus Christ and a duel of faith I challenge you in a duel of Faith so it wasn't like the devil had faith and he was fighting and the prophet had Faith No the devil had unbelief he was trying to accumulate unbelief but the sword of faith is stronger than the sword of unbelief you're exposed uhoh so the sword must have cut him pretty deep must have cut some of his mask off must have cut some of his hiding off don't tell them don't tell them don't tell them you're exposed come out of the woman in Jesus name go in peace my daughter now kind of makes me want wonder who's doing the talking go in peace my daughter hallelujah hallelujah thear it Lord Jesus we know these demons that were cast out of these people
