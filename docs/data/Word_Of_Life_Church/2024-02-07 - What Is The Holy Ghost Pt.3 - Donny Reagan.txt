[38:06] father we're so thankful that you've
[38:08] made a way that we can be accepted in
[38:11] your
[38:13] presence I pray as we Endeavor to look
[38:17] into your great Plan of Redemption
[38:20] tonight that you open your word to us
[38:23] once
[38:24] again make it make it more real to our
[38:28] hearts
[38:30] father we thank you Lord for all that
[38:33] you've done for us and what you're going
[38:34] to do bless the service be mindful of
[38:38] the needs of your people we ask in Jesus
[38:42] name amen ain't it good to be in the
[38:45] house of the Lord
[38:48] amen Colossians chapter 1 verse
[38:55] 25 what is the Holy
[38:59] Ghost what is
[39:02] it I want you to listen carefully to
[39:04] these verses that we're going to read
[39:06] tonight these are some of my favorite
[39:10] scriptures and all the
[39:14] Bible Colossians
[39:17] 1:25 whereof I am
[39:21] made a
[39:22] minister now this is Paul talking about
[39:27] of course what God has dispensed to him
[39:30] in his charge or under his care this is
[39:34] the only way God calls his men now these
[39:38] are the scriptures just for Paul alone
[39:41] but it be for every true God called
[39:44] man some men were sent and others just
[39:48] went but I want you to notice how Paul
[39:51] says this whereof I am
[39:54] made I'm made made a minister not
[39:58] desired to be not thought it would be a
[40:01] good vocation not thought it I could get
[40:03] a lot of money out of it but I was made
[40:06] a
[40:07] minister according to what
[40:11] according to the
[40:14] dispensation of God so God dispenses we
[40:19] all know what a dispensary is right we
[40:21] all know what a dispensary is during
[40:23] times of covid we put our hands under
[40:25] the alcohol and whatever more and
[40:27] whenever you do it activates it it
[40:29] dispenses something to kill the germs on
[40:32] your hands so a gospel preacher is like
[40:36] a
[40:38] dispenser and his size is according to
[40:41] God's Own plan and what he has in him to
[40:44] dispense is according to God's Own plan
[40:48] so Paul says according to the
[40:51] dispensation of
[40:53] God which is given to me for
[40:59] you this is why preachers are even
[41:02] called you're not you're not sent here
[41:04] for
[41:05] me I'm sent here for you am
[41:12] right which is given to me for you to
[41:19] fulfill the word of
[41:21] God even the
[41:24] mystery which hasth been hid from
[41:28] ages and from
[41:32] Generations but now is made
[41:36] manifest to his
[41:38] Saints to whom God would make known
[41:42] listen this next verse oh it's just
[41:45] awesome to whom God would make known
[41:49] what is the
[41:52] riches of the
[41:55] glory of of this
[41:59] mystery to whom God would make known The
[42:03] Riches of the glory of this mystery so
[42:08] there's actually riches in the glory of
[42:13] this mystery that God wanted to make
[42:16] known The Riches of the
[42:20] glory of this
[42:23] mystery now I know I give you the
[42:26] meaning of a lot of words and I just
[42:27] hope that it helps you the way that it
[42:29] helps me to understand it a little bit
[42:32] better so look at the word here mystery
[42:34] it's the Greek word
[42:36] musterion which is a hidden thing
[42:40] religious
[42:42] Secrets
[42:44] confided only to the
[42:49] initiated not to
[42:52] ordinary
[42:54] Mortals we are some kind of blst aren't
[42:57] we so it's only given to the initiated
[43:01] not to ordinary Mortals the meaning goes
[43:04] on a hidden or secret thing not obvious
[43:09] to the understanding a hidden purpose or
[43:13] counsel secret will of God the secret
[43:17] counsels which govern God in dealing
[43:21] with the righteous which are hidden from
[43:25] ungodly
[43:27] and wicked
[43:28] men but
[43:30] plain to The
[43:32] Godly I feel like a rich man
[43:37] tonight praise the
[43:39] Lord now to whom God would make known
[43:42] what is the riches of the glory and
[43:45] notice the riches in this verse are not
[43:48] the riches of the
[43:50] mystery but the riches are actually The
[43:54] Riches of the
[43:56] glory of the
[43:58] mystery The Riches of the glory so what
[44:02] Paul is expanding on here is that and
[44:04] the glory that's on this mystery so the
[44:07] mystery is so phenomenal that from this
[44:10] mystery
[44:11] emanates the shakina of God and the
[44:15] riches are coming from the abundance of
[44:19] that
[44:20] Glory of this
[44:23] mystery so brother Donnie what is the
[44:25] mystery here it
[44:27] is among the
[44:30] Gentiles which
[44:32] is Christ in
[44:38] you the
[44:40] hope of
[44:43] glory praise the Lord ain't that
[44:46] awesome we're going to pray again over
[44:48] the word um I'm sure that some of you
[44:51] know and maybe some of you don't but my
[44:54] son-in-law Lance is is in the hospital
[44:56] and he's been really really sick he's
[44:59] was diagnosed with the flu he's also
[45:02] been diagnosed with
[45:05] pancreatitis he also has a blood clot in
[45:08] the spleen and a blood clot in the
[45:11] portal from the liver to the pancreas
[45:16] and uh he really really needs prayer his
[45:20] numbers yesterday the lipas which has to
[45:22] deal with the pancreas was about 2,00
[45:26] th000 um but the doctor told him today
[45:28] that it had come down to 700 but
[45:32] whenever it reaches 700 you're still in
[45:35] critical condition so his was 2,000 so
[45:38] you can imagine how bad that it was so
[45:41] they're treating him with blood thinner
[45:43] of course for the blood clots and then
[45:46] also different things that they're doing
[45:47] for the uh you know for the other so
[45:51] would you just remember him in prayer
[45:53] that the Lord would just be with him and
[45:56] and help him he's in Sycamore shows
[45:59] there and they put
[46:04] him put him on the third
[46:08] floor right across the room from where
[46:12] Erica had passed away so that made it a
[46:16] little bit hard going up there so just
[46:19] remembering with that too we know
[46:22] there's nothing too big for our God are
[46:24] they anybody have a request you'd like
[46:26] to make known to the Saints in that as
[46:28] we pray God bless you let's just bow our
[46:30] heads together again father thank you
[46:32] for the reading of your
[46:34] word Lord God we're asking you that You'
[46:37] just be mindful of all these
[46:39] needs that were signified by the
[46:41] uplifting of the hand father you also
[46:44] see Lance in the hospital tonight I'm
[46:47] sure he's streaming right now we're
[46:50] asking Lord and believing together that
[46:53] you'd send your presence there in the
[46:54] room where he is
[46:56] we thank you that the numbers have come
[46:58] down but they're still critically high
[47:02] in the name of Jesus may it come down
[47:05] even
[47:06] lower father you see these blood clots
[47:09] you know the cause of them we're praying
[47:12] dear God that you would just
[47:15] move you see Lord he was supposed to
[47:17] have a hernia surgery he's not going to
[47:19] be able to have that right now because
[47:21] of it so he's got several things that's
[47:22] going on but we're believing you your
[47:25] mighty hand would just move for him
[47:28] strengthen him you see father he's still
[47:31] trying to get over Erica's hom going and
[47:35] then these things hit him too but we
[47:38] believe out of these things you will
[47:41] produce a man that'll be stronger than
[47:44] he's ever been in his entire walk with
[47:47] God speak to us tonight from your word
[47:50] father I am your servant reporting for
[47:55] Duty
[47:56] take my
[47:58] mouth I submit my mind my
[48:02] body my
[48:03] soul to your
[48:06] presence speak through me tonight Lord
[48:09] God I
[48:11] pray in the name of the Lord Jesus we
[48:14] ask praise the
[48:17] Lord and the saint said amen amen God
[48:21] bless you you may be
[48:24] seated
[48:28] to whom
[48:29] God would make known what is the
[48:33] riches of the glory of this
[48:37] mystery among the
[48:40] Gentiles which is Christ in
[48:43] you the hope of
[48:45] glory us being Gentiles we certainly
[48:49] Rejoice that this gospel come to us but
[48:54] I wonder if we we really have an idea of
[48:58] what it cost Paul to preach to
[49:01] us you see if Paul would have preached
[49:04] these wonderful
[49:06] things only to the Jews it would have
[49:10] eliminated so many problems that he had
[49:13] in
[49:14] life most of
[49:16] his persecution was brought on by the
[49:20] Jews for several years so if he would
[49:24] have only preached things that the Jews
[49:28] would have wanted him to hear no doubt
[49:30] they would have absolutely loved the
[49:33] understanding that God gave this
[49:36] man but instead of holding his peace and
[49:40] just preaching things that would make
[49:43] everybody happy boy am I glad tonight
[49:47] that he went beyond the court of the
[49:50] Jews and preached to us bunch of dogs
[49:54] anybody else happy with me
[49:57] tonight now the mystery that Paul saw
[50:02] quite unlike Peter unlike our precious
[50:06] brother James brother James never did
[50:10] really see it the way that Paul
[50:13] did the pastor of the church in
[50:16] Jerusalem never did really Venture that
[50:18] far out no record historically or in the
[50:22] scripture that he ever went and visited
[50:25] or preached to the Gentile churches you
[50:29] all I don't think there'll be any of us
[50:31] that'll stand there that day though and
[50:33] condemn James because he never reached
[50:36] out to us men can only preach what God
[50:40] shows them and if they're doing all they
[50:43] know to do then I'm so glad God will
[50:45] judge them only by that aren't you but
[50:49] there was some like this man that was
[50:52] given such an Open Door
[50:56] into what God had done I love the way
[50:59] that he he writes this and when you
[51:01] study these men the way that they wrote
[51:04] you can find a certain style you see it
[51:08] with Matthew Matthew projected Jesus as
[51:11] the Son of Man Mark projected him of
[51:14] course as the Son of God and Luke more
[51:17] as the son of David but John projected
[51:21] him as the logos so whenever each one of
[51:25] of them would write and you study the
[51:27] way that they would write same way any
[51:29] of us us would each officer would have a
[51:32] certain thing about them they would have
[51:34] a certain Rhythm and they would have a
[51:36] way that they would use verbs and
[51:38] adverbs and adjectives and so on and
[51:40] once you learn Paul style it it's
[51:43] beautiful it's absolutely beautiful in
[51:45] the way that he does and and he would
[51:46] take these Hebrew words and when he
[51:49] wanted to emphasize a phrase he would
[51:52] build one word on top of another on top
[51:57] of another in order to make this this
[52:00] word that he's wanting to emphasize such
[52:03] an accumulative word that the writers
[52:07] and the the readers in that day that
[52:09] understood this language they must have
[52:11] been overwhelmed because they knew this
[52:14] poine as they call it style and they
[52:17] knew by the way he was layering it with
[52:21] one word after another he was building
[52:25] it up to the crescendo so you imagine
[52:28] when they begin to read this in
[52:30] Colossians and they were blessed by the
[52:34] understanding of what Paul had said so
[52:37] he he accumulates phrase on top of
[52:42] phrase on top of phrase to come to this
[52:47] greatness of what God had done and then
[52:51] he uses this word riches which is a
[52:55] common word I don't know if you've ever
[52:57] noticed it or not but it was as we are
[53:00] very familiar with the word thread today
[53:03] and there will be threads that will be
[53:05] run on certain chats and you know
[53:07] threads on Instagram and all that sort
[53:09] of thing and Paul did the same thing so
[53:12] he would use certain words to be able to
[53:16] be able to expound on the wisdom of God
[53:19] and the grace of God and the mercy of
[53:22] God and he would use certain words when
[53:24] he would want to make it so great and so
[53:30] expound upon them and the word riches
[53:34] was one of those words that Paul used
[53:37] over and over again but he was not using
[53:41] them in a way that we would think
[53:44] naturally that the riches was about your
[53:47] house your cattle you know your acreage
[53:50] your land but it was about the good
[53:53] things that God God had bestowed upon
[53:58] his people and he used the word riches
[54:02] to Define that and to be able to build
[54:05] and bring it to the people where they
[54:07] would be able to see hey hey I got an
[54:10] idea why don't we take a little journey
[54:12] tonight and we'll what we will do we
[54:16] will walk into the bank of heaven and
[54:19] each of us will pull out our account
[54:23] with our name and our number on it and
[54:27] we'll take a little trip through the
[54:30] scriptures and we'll open up and see how
[54:34] rich We Are
[54:36] Tonight now maybe if you were to do that
[54:39] on your phone many of you maybe you Bank
[54:42] online and you'd be able to open it up
[54:44] and type in your password and all that
[54:46] or maybe you've got a face image and you
[54:48] could do it and instantaneously you
[54:50] would be able to find how much you've
[54:52] got in your checking account your CD
[54:54] your savings and on and on and on
[54:57] depending on how much you've got you
[54:59] might look in there and see that you're
[55:01] overdrawn you might look in there and
[55:03] your account would actually produce a
[55:05] very nervous type of feeling because you
[55:09] know you've got another two or three
[55:10] checks that's going to come in and you
[55:12] know sure as the world they're going to
[55:13] bounce and they're going to cost you $25
[55:15] a piece but let me just tell you before
[55:19] we open our account tonight by face
[55:22] recognition none of us are going to be
[55:26] overdrawn as a matter of fact there
[55:28] won't be a one of us that'll have to
[55:30] walk away nervous tonight afraid that
[55:33] the checks are going to ride on healing
[55:35] or Deliverance or peace or power or
[55:38] salvation are going to be overdrawn we
[55:40] can walk away from here tonight with
[55:42] great confidence that every check you
[55:44] write from from now on will be covered
[55:48] by the mercy of
[55:50] God look with me in the Book of Romans
[55:52] chapter 2 verse 4 or despises thou The
[55:58] Riches of his goodness and
[56:02] forbearing and
[56:04] longsuffering
[56:06] goodness goodness forbearance and
[56:10] longsuffering and yet Paul identifies
[56:13] them as riches so it isn't like that God
[56:18] has just a little bit and then God is
[56:23] overdrawn and and God you know to to
[56:26] think that God has been longsuffering
[56:29] and forbearing with man since the Garden
[56:33] of Eden but Paul wants us to know that
[56:36] the longsuffering of God and the
[56:39] goodness and the forbearance of God they
[56:42] are like an account that is so massive
[56:46] and has so much in there that they can
[56:49] never be overdrawn though Millions might
[56:52] be pulling from them they
[56:56] daily The Riches of his goodness and
[56:59] forbearance and longsuffering not
[57:01] knowing that the goodness of God leadeth
[57:04] thee to repentance now you see the lower
[57:09] the
[57:10] degradation of the
[57:12] Gentiles would prove the
[57:15] higher of the glory of God revealed in
[57:20] their lives and this is what that the
[57:22] Jews could not comprehend they could not
[57:25] see the one man that Paul wrote about in
[57:28] the New Testament when he talked about
[57:29] the mystery of the Jews and the Gentiles
[57:33] being converged together into the one
[57:36] new man that's the terms that he used
[57:39] and it just totally blinded the Jews
[57:41] they could not see that the Gentiles
[57:44] would ever be brought in anywhere close
[57:47] to where they were and they sure
[57:49] couldn't accept that they were going to
[57:51] be replaced by them they could not even
[57:54] grasp for comprehended and yet Paul said
[57:57] now those of you that are grafted in
[57:59] don't think it was because of your
[58:01] goodness it was the mercy of God is that
[58:05] right but yet here he he brings this so
[58:08] the lower the degradation of the
[58:11] Gentiles the higher the glory of God is
[58:15] going to bring them up so the expansion
[58:18] of the depths of sin that we was in the
[58:20] lowest hell and how God brings us what
[58:24] does it prove the riches of his Mercy
[58:29] because we were lower than the Jews we
[58:31] were not even a people we were a Godless
[58:35] people worshiping idols and heathens in
[58:38] idol worship and all kinds of stuff is
[58:41] that right so when the mystery is truly
[58:44] revealed in the Gentiles you can see why
[58:48] the glory of God will be so rich and it
[58:52] will mag be magnified in such a great
[58:55] way notice again in Romans 9: 23 that he
[59:00] might make known The Riches of his glory
[59:05] on the vessels of Mercy now this word
[59:09] glory is doca now we know that the glory
[59:12] of God is something no doubt most of us
[59:16] still yet understand very little about
[59:19] we can see the Shak as we call it shakan
[59:21] in English but that was what Moses
[59:24] wanted to look into and see the face of
[59:26] God and God only allowed him to see just
[59:30] a little small portion Ezekiel Saw a
[59:33] little bit of it few of the prophets
[59:35] were able to see it but it was the very
[59:38] Heart Of God that was going to be
[59:39] revealed in the mystery of Christ and
[59:42] God kept it hid from them until his
[59:45] heart was opened up and made manifest
[59:48] and it was something that no doubt we
[59:51] will be understanding as the ages go on
[59:56] now keep in mind it was hid from ages
[59:59] and generation but once it's being made
[1:00:02] known it will be revealed down through
[1:00:05] eternity as the ages still unfold now
[1:00:09] look what he said that he might make
[1:00:11] known The Riches of his glory on the
[1:00:15] vessels of Mercy which he had a four
[1:00:19] prepared unto Glory so there will be
[1:00:23] Riches of glor Glory that will be
[1:00:26] revealed on the vessels of Mercy wow
[1:00:29] what a name to call us by vessels of
[1:00:34] Mercy now not just vessels that receive
[1:00:37] Mercy but the mercy was so great we were
[1:00:41] actually changed into vessels of Mercy
[1:00:47] what we received was so profound that it
[1:00:51] actually changed us from just being
[1:00:53] recipient
[1:00:55] that were on the bottom of the totem
[1:00:56] polus we would say it so transformed us
[1:01:01] it renamed us it rearize everything
[1:01:06] about us and we're not just recipients
[1:01:09] of Mercy but we are actually vessels of
[1:01:15] Mercy which he had aor prepared unto
[1:01:19] Glory again Romans
[1:01:21] 11:33 oh the
[1:01:25] depth of the riches both of the wisdom
[1:01:30] and knowledge of God oh the depth of the
[1:01:35] riches notice he doesn't just say oh the
[1:01:38] depths of the wisdom and knowledge of
[1:01:40] God but all the depth of the riches of
[1:01:45] the wisdom and knowledge of God and this
[1:01:47] is you know this is typical Pauline as
[1:01:50] would say because now the rest of the
[1:01:52] authors of the New Testament break into
[1:01:53] this but God allowed him to break into
[1:01:57] the bank of heaven and be able to walk
[1:02:00] in to the safe as it were and see that
[1:02:04] every believer had an account and they
[1:02:07] had a personal safety deposit box in
[1:02:11] Christ Jesus and it's like Paul was
[1:02:13] carried into it to see this is a
[1:02:16] treasure Trove of riches of the glory of
[1:02:20] God of the wisdom of God of the
[1:02:22] forbearance of God of the longsuffering
[1:02:25] of God so it's not something that God is
[1:02:28] you know coming with pain the pain is
[1:02:31] over friends his pain is what unleashed
[1:02:35] the treasure to you and I as the people
[1:02:38] of God it's no longer hurting the Lord
[1:02:40] Jesus to forgive you it's no longer
[1:02:43] hurting the Lord Jesus to give you mercy
[1:02:46] and kindness and forbearance I wish
[1:02:48] somebody would preach with me tonight
[1:02:51] but what is it it changed from Pain to
[1:02:54] Glory it chained from a crowning of the
[1:02:57] Thorns it's pointing to the time when we
[1:03:00] as the saints of God will crown him king
[1:03:03] of kings and Lord of
[1:03:06] lords oh the depths of the riches both
[1:03:10] of the wisdom and knowledge of God how
[1:03:14] unsearchable are his judgments and his
[1:03:17] ways past finding out Ephesians 1:7 in
[1:03:22] whom we have Redemption through his
[1:03:24] blood the Forgiveness of sins according
[1:03:28] to the
[1:03:31] riches according to the riches of his
[1:03:36] grace now you may be sitting here
[1:03:38] tonight and you may not have enough
[1:03:39] money to go through a drive-thru at at
[1:03:42] McDonald's at church and buy yourself a
[1:03:44] hamburger and a cold drink but you know
[1:03:46] what if you're in Christ Jesus you are
[1:03:49] one of the wealthiest Mortals that has
[1:03:52] ever lived on the face of the Earth
[1:03:55] don't feel sorry for yourself and don't
[1:03:58] let the devil tell you you ain't nobody
[1:04:00] and you ain't got nothing you need to
[1:04:02] start looking at your riches in Christ
[1:04:05] Jesus all in whom we have Redemption
[1:04:09] through his blood the Forgiveness of
[1:04:12] sins according to the riches notice not
[1:04:16] just one attribute of Grace but the
[1:04:19] riches which is imp plurality The Riches
[1:04:23] of his grace in his grace is diverse
[1:04:27] riches do you understand that in the
[1:04:30] grace of God is one of the aspect of the
[1:04:33] riches is the Saving Grace when you were
[1:04:36] lost but then you needed another Grace
[1:04:39] which was sanctifying Grace you needed
[1:04:42] another Grace which was the baptism of
[1:04:44] the Holy Ghost and then the last Grace
[1:04:47] you're going to need is called rapturing
[1:04:51] Grace don't you understand the rapture
[1:04:54] is the consummation of the unfolding of
[1:04:58] the riches of God's grace how many still
[1:05:00] needs Grace in your day ever life well
[1:05:02] whenever you do that when you fall short
[1:05:04] of the glory of God or you need strength
[1:05:06] or encouraging when we're alive and our
[1:05:09] bodies are going to be changed what's it
[1:05:11] going to be it's going to be from the
[1:05:13] Vault of this channel of God's grace and
[1:05:16] God will allow us to be ministered to
[1:05:19] what rapturing is it amazing that it
[1:05:22] didn't call it rapturing this or
[1:05:24] rapturing that but he called it
[1:05:26] rapturing Grace why it's in the
[1:05:29] unfolding Riches of our God which will
[1:05:32] bring you to the higher phase of
[1:05:36] Glory now notice Paul says in whom we
[1:05:39] have this Redemption so he has redeemed
[1:05:42] us so to redeem was to purchase and set
[1:05:46] free by paying a price to purchase and
[1:05:51] set free by paying a price I found this
[1:05:56] in history and I thought i' thought to
[1:05:57] share it with you that there was 60
[1:06:00] million slaves in the Roman Empire about
[1:06:04] the time that Paul wrote this 60 million
[1:06:09] slaves in the Roman Empire and they were
[1:06:13] bought and sold and they had no more
[1:06:16] value than than a piece of furniture or
[1:06:18] a horse or a cow oh how God hated such a
[1:06:21] deal but a man could
[1:06:24] buy a slave and set him free so if a man
[1:06:29] wanted to go out and he had all kinds of
[1:06:32] money and he had wealth and he'd go to
[1:06:34] the slave market and he'd buy a 100 or
[1:06:37] 200 or 500 or a th000 whatever he wanted
[1:06:40] and he would stand there and he would
[1:06:42] buy him then he could turn right around
[1:06:45] and give them from him as the
[1:06:48] owner absolute clearance on the deed of
[1:06:52] their life and make them totally free
[1:06:56] from slavery don't you understand that's
[1:06:58] what the Lord Jesus did to us we were
[1:07:01] slaves under sin we were born slaves we
[1:07:04] were born lost is that right and what
[1:07:07] did he do he come and redeemed us he
[1:07:11] paid a price this is why we are not our
[1:07:13] own we belong to the Lord Jesus well
[1:07:17] come on somebody your job your money
[1:07:19] your bank account your health your mouth
[1:07:22] your ears every you are belongs to Jesus
[1:07:27] Christ that's right so his blood paid
[1:07:30] the price and then he set us free
[1:07:34] Ephesians 1: 18 the eyes of your
[1:07:38] understanding being enlightened that you
[1:07:39] may know what is the hope of his calling
[1:07:44] and what the riches of the
[1:07:49] glory help us Lord to see this
[1:07:52] please help us
[1:07:56] what the
[1:07:57] riches of the
[1:08:01] glory of his
[1:08:06] inheritance in the
[1:08:10] Saints do you understand what his
[1:08:13] inheritance
[1:08:15] is
[1:08:22] you
[1:08:24] my inheritance is
[1:08:29] him his
[1:08:31] inheritance it's
[1:08:36] me and I know what you're thinking
[1:08:38] you're thinking he sure got the bad end
[1:08:40] of the
[1:08:43] deal not the way he looks at
[1:08:51] it not the way he looks at it
[1:08:56] how could he come up with such an
[1:09:01] equation you see the value of
[1:09:05] it it's by the
[1:09:08] price that was
[1:09:13] paid so Carol
[1:09:16] has a little piece of CLA about this
[1:09:22] big cent Frank
[1:09:26] with a piece of clear glass on
[1:09:28] it it has a scripture on
[1:09:33] it it has a church
[1:09:36] building and it has some
[1:09:43] grass it was
[1:09:46] Handmade by
[1:09:52] someone I I would not take
[1:09:58] $100,000 for that
[1:10:05] tonight you want to know
[1:10:09] what cuz Erica made
[1:10:22] it
[1:10:25] so what gives it the
[1:10:32] value you've got things that you say oh
[1:10:35] they're Priceless no it's not for
[1:10:39] sale come on everything's for sale no
[1:10:42] it's
[1:10:44] not people may look at us oh my goodness
[1:10:47] I I knew them I I you know I know them
[1:10:49] now I know they still make mistakes
[1:10:51] they're for saleing Jesus would say
[1:10:54] they are not for
[1:10:58] sale they are
[1:11:01] Priceless you can't even set a value on
[1:11:05] them they are not for
[1:11:10] sale so what makes the value what makes
[1:11:14] the
[1:11:15] value well it depends on the buyer or
[1:11:18] plural
[1:11:20] buyers and the way they look at the
[1:11:25] value notice he says the eyes of your
[1:11:28] understanding being enlightened that you
[1:11:29] may know what is the hope of his calling
[1:11:32] that ye may know what is the hope of his
[1:11:36] calling and what the riches of the
[1:11:40] glory of his
[1:11:43] inheritance in the Saints so the riches
[1:11:47] in the glory of the
[1:11:50] inheritance of the Saints he himself
[1:11:54] will be paid
[1:11:56] back from the
[1:12:00] deposit and
[1:12:02] price he paid for
[1:12:05] us so where does he get his
[1:12:08] return it's all about the
[1:12:14] investment the
[1:12:16] investment increases the value of the
[1:12:22] goods being
[1:12:24] bought now if a rich man wanted to buy
[1:12:27] you know some kind of car or something
[1:12:29] other you know the these people are
[1:12:31] Wonder buy oh you know I'll pay 25 I'll
[1:12:33] pay I'll pay I'll pay 35,000 man that's
[1:12:36] a great buy but Ed on must walks
[1:12:40] in and he wants
[1:12:43] it
[1:12:46] 585,000 1.2
[1:12:50] million well all of a sudden the value
[1:12:53] goes up
[1:12:54] why richest man in the world can buy
[1:12:57] pretty much whatever he wants to I
[1:13:00] guess but what if we move Beyond this
[1:13:02] world and we move into
[1:13:05] Eternity for the king of
[1:13:10] riches says I want a
[1:13:13] people I want a people like
[1:13:17] me I want a people who will love me more
[1:13:21] than anything else in this world
[1:13:25] world when I find them they'll be so
[1:13:28] lowly they'll be so rotten they'll be so
[1:13:33] degradated but I will pay such a price
[1:13:36] for them and when it strikes them
[1:13:39] finally what I've paid for them the
[1:13:42] value of what I
[1:13:44] paid will release them from the
[1:13:48] condemnation they
[1:13:50] experiened and they will have a super
[1:13:53] natural appraisal of their
[1:13:57] soul Glory they will get a supernal
[1:14:01] appraisal of their
[1:14:04] soul and realize in my
[1:14:08] sight they are
[1:14:19] Priceless the Saints themselves
[1:14:24] are the Lord's
[1:14:27] portion we talk about heaven and what
[1:14:29] all we're going to get we're going to
[1:14:30] get a mansion we're going to get streets
[1:14:31] of gold we're going to get this this
[1:14:33] this this this so
[1:14:36] what does he
[1:14:40] get he's the creator of golden
[1:14:43] streets but he don't want
[1:14:46] them he don't want Gates of pearl
[1:14:49] they're not for
[1:14:51] him he knows how women like
[1:14:56] pearls you reckon all this is being made
[1:14:59] for him that's not his law
[1:15:03] Terry look what in Deuteronomy
[1:15:09] 32:9 for the Lord's
[1:15:14] portion is his
[1:15:22] people and you say boy he he sure don't
[1:15:26] know how to make a deal I beg to differ
[1:15:28] with you he knows how to make a
[1:15:33] deal and the way he looks at
[1:15:37] it he's getting more than we
[1:15:45] are so what should you think he values
[1:15:48] the
[1:15:49] most his own blood or you
[1:15:57] so if you go to LongHorn
[1:15:59] Steakhouse you get to
[1:16:01] menu your favorite steak will say is the
[1:16:05] New York Street if you been there in a
[1:16:08] while they've raised the price on it
[1:16:11] again you look down to there and you say
[1:16:14] man do I want to pay $24.95 for that
[1:16:17] thank goodness gracious oh oh man I
[1:16:21] don't know do I
[1:16:24] you're setting out the menu on your hand
[1:16:25] here comes a waitress and she's taking
[1:16:27] one to the table right next to
[1:16:32] you I want the New York
[1:16:36] strip so what you did was you made a
[1:16:42] decision to trade off $26.95 or whatever
[1:16:46] it was for that
[1:16:48] Ser now if you go to Juniper you're
[1:16:51] going to pay even more than that
[1:16:54] and you say it's worth
[1:16:57] it there'll be other people in there and
[1:16:59] come sit down they'll order a hamburger
[1:17:00] and french
[1:17:01] fries cuz to them it ain't worth it you
[1:17:06] see there's where there's a lot of
[1:17:08] hamburger
[1:17:10] Christians they do not consider giving
[1:17:12] up this and giving up that and quitting
[1:17:15] this and quitting that just just to go
[1:17:17] to heaven just to be a child of
[1:17:22] God
[1:17:25] but the bride
[1:17:27] type they look at it and
[1:17:30] say whatever you
[1:17:33] want it's
[1:17:35] yours anything on my house you see you
[1:17:38] want take it anything in my house you
[1:17:40] see you don't like tell me I'll trash it
[1:17:44] anything you want me to do I'm Yours
[1:17:46] here's my life here's my children here's
[1:17:48] my grandchildren here's our church
[1:17:51] here's everything we are
[1:17:53] do with it as you
[1:17:56] please but you see the hamburger
[1:17:58] Christians
[1:18:00] said but what if he does something I
[1:18:02] don't want him to do and He will yeah
[1:18:05] but you see a real believer will commit
[1:18:08] to him and wipe the tears from their
[1:18:11] eyes when they watch him do it because
[1:18:14] they love him more than they love
[1:18:16] anything else in the world and he looks
[1:18:20] at that and he says oh
[1:18:24] there's my
[1:18:29] treasure because he looks at what you
[1:18:34] were Beyond Hope was no mercy no way for
[1:18:39] you to ever love him that
[1:18:42] way before he got to you it wasn't in
[1:18:46] you it wasn't in
[1:18:48] me but he looks at you and he makes a
[1:18:51] deposit and redeems you and buys you
[1:18:54] then he don't take you from the devil's
[1:18:55] chains and chain you up to him but he
[1:18:59] buys you and set you
[1:19:04] free and fills you with
[1:19:09] love and
[1:19:11] says I love you with all of my heart
[1:19:15] brother and I want you to love me the
[1:19:17] same way but not with a
[1:19:21] whip not
[1:19:23] chained we're not held by Steel any type
[1:19:27] of metal we're held by chains of
[1:19:30] Love they're
[1:19:34] invisible oh you imagine this amazing
[1:19:38] truth that God would look on
[1:19:43] us and consider us to be
[1:19:48] part of his great
[1:19:51] wealth
[1:19:56] and we look at ourselves as being an
[1:19:59] expenditure we look at ourselves as
[1:20:01] being this great debt you know that God
[1:20:04] has this great debt that he took on
[1:20:07] because of
[1:20:09] us he looks at it the exact opposite he
[1:20:12] said don't you
[1:20:15] understand you are making me
[1:20:21] wealthy you you are allowing
[1:20:24] me to express my glory through the

[1:21:25] wealthy this Wednesday I've lived
[1:21:29] another life right in the middle of hell
[1:21:31] right in the middle of Satan's e and
[1:21:34] I've lived an overcoming life I've lived
[1:21:36] a Godly life I've lived a life that is
[1:21:39] pleasing to my Lord and it's not what I
[1:21:42] have done it's not what you have done
[1:21:45] but the riches of his grace has been
[1:21:48] deposited in my life and it has produced
[1:21:52] another another overcoming day for a
[1:21:55] child of God hallelujah that can stand

[1:22:05] have made my Lord more rich and more
[1:22:09] wealthy
[1:22:12] [Applause]
[1:22:15] today because of his

[1:22:24] just as a man's
[1:22:26] wealth bring
[1:22:28] glory to his
[1:22:32] name now think about it a man who would
[1:22:36] pick himself up by his bootstraps as we
[1:22:38] say and you know turn turned into a
[1:22:41] little small business or whatever more
[1:22:43] and he would turn into Be A Millionaire
[1:22:45] and people say wow that's a self-made
[1:22:48] man that that's a self-made man started
[1:22:51] out my you know down in the hills of
[1:22:54] wherever he was from and look at that
[1:22:56] guy I want you to look at what he's done
[1:22:57] so his wealth brings honor and glory to
[1:23:02] his
[1:23:05] name that ain't
[1:23:09] nothing in case you ain't checked lately
[1:23:13] inflation ain't
[1:23:15] good anybody been to the grocery store
[1:23:17] this
[1:23:18] week painful wasn't it hurt you bad is
[1:23:22] it biomics whoops whoops I ain't
[1:23:25] supposed to be preaching politics here
[1:23:26] we
[1:23:27] go inflation everything's going up
[1:23:31] except for your wages of course well
[1:23:34] come on somebody and you're taking less
[1:23:37] home as a matter of fact you've lost
[1:23:39] several hundred on your purchasing power
[1:23:42] in the last several years so your money
[1:23:45] is worth less and it takes more men car
[1:23:49] went through Weds other morning to get a
[1:23:50] little breakfast my Lord is 18 $1 and
[1:23:53] some I thought I didn't want to buy part
[1:23:54] interest in this in this place I just
[1:23:57] wanted two little sandwiches and two
[1:23:59] drinks are you kidding me I'm about to
[1:24:01] refinance my c e three times a day what
[1:24:04] in the world is going on well it's the
[1:24:06] economics of this world and our nation
[1:24:08] is going to fall flat on his face it's
[1:24:11] already busted you might as well say
[1:24:13] Amen but while the world is getting poor
[1:24:17] and poor the saints of God around the
[1:24:20] world are getting richer and richer
[1:24:22] we have lived another week in Satan's
[1:24:25] eeden and we have brought more wealth to
[1:24:28] our Lord we have prove he has an
[1:24:31] abundance of Mercy he has an abundance
[1:24:34] of Grace he has an abundance of
[1:24:37] forgiveness I want him to express his
[1:24:39] glory to my life don't
[1:24:43] you
[1:24:47] oh as a man's wealth will bring him
[1:24:51] glory so God will get
[1:24:55] Glory by his wealth being
[1:24:58] expressed in his
[1:25:02] church because of his investment you
[1:25:05] it's not you it's not me the whole key
[1:25:10] brother I thought you was preaching on
[1:25:11] what is the Holy Ghost I
[1:25:16] am this is what makes his
[1:25:21] wealth God changed
[1:25:24] himself into a form of
[1:25:27] spiritual
[1:25:31] currency traveling around the
[1:25:34] world most of the places that I've been
[1:25:38] most of them want US
[1:25:40] Dollars well I don't know since it's
[1:25:42] went down so much if they wanted as much
[1:25:44] anymore or not but I do used to that's
[1:25:45] what they want so when you go on the
[1:25:48] streets whether it been in Israel Africa
[1:25:51] wherever it is that have the black
[1:25:52] market
[1:25:53] guys now whenever you go into the
[1:25:56] airport if you want so many shekels
[1:25:58] which is Israeli money or if you want so
[1:26:00] much you know whatever it is Nation
[1:26:01] you're going into you can exchange it at
[1:26:04] the airport US Dollars and they'll give
[1:26:06] you a certain exchange rate but if you
[1:26:09] wait a little bit and get out on the
[1:26:10] streets there'll be some guys out there
[1:26:12] and they'll be wanting to exchange it
[1:26:14] for you and they'll use a little less so
[1:26:17] you actually get more of their
[1:26:19] money but for some of them you can only
[1:26:23] buy if you have their
[1:26:26] money well here we were we were in so
[1:26:29] much
[1:26:29] debt and God had the currency of deity
[1:26:33] and
[1:26:35] royalty but we couldn't have access to
[1:26:38] it so God had to change his currency
[1:26:42] format and become in a dispensable
[1:26:47] form now think about it what Paul said
[1:26:50] Christ in you the hope of glory Christ
[1:26:54] in you can you imagine every person
[1:26:56] you're tonight and every person around
[1:26:58] the world that has the Lord Jesus living
[1:27:00] in them with the true baptism of the
[1:27:01] Holy Ghost they actually have Christ in
[1:27:03] them you believe that Christ in you how
[1:27:06] is that even possible now notice Paul
[1:27:09] didn't say Jesus in
[1:27:11] you it's not the body of Jesus it's
[1:27:14] Christ what is
[1:27:16] Christ the dispensable form of God's
[1:27:20] presence which could be
[1:27:23] divided who would ever think about a
[1:27:25] being in such Eternal Realms that he
[1:27:29] would be able to divide himself into
[1:27:32] millions and millions of parts and he's
[1:27:35] just as great as he was before he
[1:27:37] started subdividing
[1:27:40] himself but it had to be changed into a
[1:27:43] form that could be got and spent and
[1:27:47] used so God was in Christ his human
[1:27:54] currency and in that form he could pay
[1:27:57] the price glory to God and then not only
[1:28:02] paid the price but on the day of
[1:28:03] Pentecost the same money that paid for
[1:28:07] you glory the same money would turn
[1:28:11] right back around in the form of the
[1:28:12] Holy Ghost and come back and live inside
[1:28:15] of you for the rest of your journey
[1:28:17] hallelujah amen So Not only was the
[1:28:20] money used to buy you out but he said
[1:28:23] now tell what I'm going to do I'm going
[1:28:24] to give you a little spending money on
[1:28:26] the way so I paid for you I bought you I
[1:28:29] set you free and here's your little
[1:28:31] spending money the baptism of the Holy
[1:28:34] Ghost if you need healing cash it in you
[1:28:37] need deliver cash it in because I am
[1:28:40] your spending money
[1:28:46] hallelujah praise
[1:28:51] God so our riches are in
[1:28:56] God God's riches are in
[1:29:00] US Ephesians 2:7 that in the ages to
[1:29:05] come listen now that in the ages to
[1:29:09] come he might show the exceeding
[1:29:13] Riches of his
[1:29:15] grace and his kindness toward us through
[1:29:19] his human
[1:29:20] currency Christ
[1:29:23] Jesus that in the
[1:29:26] ages to come do you understand our
[1:29:29] father is so great and magnificent that
[1:29:32] in
[1:29:34] eternity he will still be unveiling
[1:29:39] himself glory be to
[1:29:41] God Ephesians 3:8 unto me who am less
[1:29:46] and the least of All Saints is this
[1:29:49] Grace given that I should preach among
[1:29:52] the
[1:29:53] Gentiles The unsearchable
[1:29:57] Riches of
[1:29:59] Christ verse 16 that he would Grant you
[1:30:03] according to the riches of his glory to
[1:30:08] be strengthened with might by his spirit
[1:30:12] in the Inner
[1:30:13] Man now listen carefully the Holy
[1:30:17] Ghost is your
[1:30:19] part of deity yes sir yes
[1:30:23] sir now remember the currency had to be
[1:30:26] changed into a form by which would be
[1:30:29] accepted for payment and also in case
[1:30:32] you needed anything along the
[1:30:35] way so you've got to have a vessel by
[1:30:38] which this currency can be compatible
[1:30:41] with so was it invisible had it been an
[1:30:44] invisible form then you'd never been
[1:30:46] able to got visibility around it so he
[1:30:50] changed himself to him who was invisible
[1:30:54] and become visible he merged the Two
[1:30:57] Worlds together the invisible and the
[1:31:00] visible met together in the currency
[1:31:03] Christ
[1:31:05] Jesus then the visible was made manifest
[1:31:09] and poured out the chemistry visible out
[1:31:12] of his body and broke open the blood
[1:31:15] cell visible and released the invisible
[1:31:20] the very life of God
[1:31:23] praise the Lord so he come to call all
[1:31:27] those whose names are written on the
[1:31:28] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:31:30] foundation of the world I know you don't
[1:31:32] remember it neither do I but we were a
[1:31:35] part of his godhead before the currency
[1:31:37] ever
[1:31:39] changed watch this the word made flesh
[1:31:43] they that are sons of God are led by the
[1:31:45] spirit of God then when the human
[1:31:47] element goes out and the spirit of God
[1:31:49] FS that vacancy where you empty yourself
[1:31:53] amen then will the church and its power
[1:31:55] the resurrection of the Lord Jesus walk
[1:31:58] in his steps in his power in his
[1:32:01] thoughts in his being in his moving you
[1:32:04] see what I mean then your thoughts
[1:32:07] become words and words will become
[1:32:11] material that's when the church is in
[1:32:14] its power I believe it's on the road
[1:32:19] that when the church will be so wrapped
[1:32:22] in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind will
[1:32:25] so away froms they don't see thems don't
[1:32:29] you understand this is why we need
[1:32:30] preaching like this to help us to see
[1:32:33] oursel in closer proximity of the way
[1:32:35] the father sees us you all the time
[1:32:38] looking at yourself some of you think
[1:32:39] you're worthless you ain't no good at
[1:32:41] all and the angels of God are standing
[1:32:43] there looking it ain't no wonder the
[1:32:44] angels are looking they're saying he's
[1:32:47] invested his whole wealth in them bunch
[1:32:49] of people how in the world can he he
[1:32:51] said that I am wey through them he ain't
[1:32:54] never said that about Gabriel he ain't
[1:32:56] never said that about the cheram he
[1:32:58] never said that about the universe God's
[1:33:01] inheritance is not the universe it's his
[1:33:05] [Applause]
[1:33:09] children don't you understand the
[1:33:13] universe never
[1:33:17] fell not the
[1:33:19] universe that was one
[1:33:22] Planet one out of the trillions
[1:33:27] one the one Adam lived
[1:33:30] on we have no other record that the
[1:33:32] others fell no other record that the
[1:33:35] others tilted on their AES 22 and a half
[1:33:37] degrees only the home of
[1:33:42] man
[1:33:46] Hallelujah notice this they just move in
[1:33:50] the spirit live in the spirit move in
[1:33:51] the spirit walk in the spirit Soul
[1:33:53] fulfill the law of Christ then the love
[1:33:55] of Christ and the move moving in the
[1:33:57] Holy Ghost that great wonderful Church
[1:34:00] listen this will go forth with power and
[1:34:04] deity because deity will be
[1:34:08] revealed in human
[1:34:15] beings so if I transfer
[1:34:19] money when I flew into B Bay years ago
[1:34:22] change the name of it
[1:34:24] now and I Chang US Dollars into their
[1:34:29] rupees some of these countries will not
[1:34:32] allow their
[1:34:33] residents to have US Dollars it's
[1:34:36] illegal for
[1:34:37] them so in order to help the
[1:34:40] poor I will change money sometimes
[1:34:44] because I know some of their
[1:34:45] loss so if I'm want to give anything to
[1:34:48] the poor I could have pocketfuls of $100
[1:34:52] bills it won't do them one good at all
[1:34:56] because their government does not want
[1:34:58] them to have US
[1:34:59] Dollars you and I run to the government
[1:35:02] of the devil one day he didn't want us
[1:35:04] to have the Holy Ghost I don't blame
[1:35:08] him I don't blame him he didn't want us
[1:35:12] to have salvation he didn't want us to
[1:35:14] have sanctification he didn't want us to
[1:35:17] have revelation of the
[1:35:20] word so the Lord God said I'll change
[1:35:24] myself into a dispensable form by which
[1:35:28] the peasant and the pper on the
[1:35:32] street can be able to receive my
[1:35:34] inheritance and they can take that and
[1:35:37] go to the store and buy them something
[1:35:40] to
[1:35:41] eat and I've done it that way believe me
[1:35:44] so the poor on the street and me take
[1:35:46] money but you have to watch what you're
[1:35:48] doing cuz once they see you're giving it
[1:35:50] out they will AB absolutely throng you
[1:35:53] they are so poor and in such need they
[1:35:56] will throng you if they see you're
[1:35:58] giving out money if people would do that
[1:36:00] for money what about the Holy Ghost what
[1:36:04] about salvation what about eternal
[1:36:09] life Oh Glory look at it bruised wounded
[1:36:15] Tor opened up his side with a Roman
[1:36:17] spear in order that by the Holy Spirit
[1:36:20] we might be baptized into his body
[1:36:22] partakers of his divine nature you get
[1:36:26] it then you become a partaker after
[1:36:30] coming into his body a partaker of his
[1:36:32] divine nature Christ's
[1:36:35] nature and
[1:36:38] you how can you cheat steal lie
[1:36:42] backslide
[1:36:44] prolite do everything else with the
[1:36:47] divine nature of Christ in you it's
[1:36:50] impossible
[1:36:51] all our warnings and our fussing and
[1:36:54] steings and arguing and tempers all
[1:36:56] these things pass away you see it what
[1:36:59] is the fruit of the spirit we planted it
[1:37:00] on the church membership upon shouting
[1:37:03] upon demonstrations of works but the
[1:37:05] fruit of the spirit is first
[1:37:08] love love
[1:37:10] who then is when you love
[1:37:13] those who are
[1:37:20] unlovable
[1:37:21] let's jump down to the next one here the
[1:37:23] testimony of a true witness the Holy
[1:37:25] Ghost the witness of God what is it
[1:37:30] deity
[1:37:32] tabernacled in men yes
[1:37:38] sir
[1:37:39] deity how many believes
[1:37:43] it again he said church that's the
[1:37:45] reason I can't take the baptism of the
[1:37:47] Holy Ghost of crying shaking speaking in
[1:37:51] tongues or any sensation they're all
[1:37:54] right now them things are all right but
[1:37:56] the devil can impersonate that so
[1:37:59] real but the Holy Ghost is
[1:38:03] deity God
[1:38:07] tabernacled in
[1:38:11] Men He Knows by doing this and his
[1:38:17] investment is hidden by eternal
[1:38:25] [Laughter]
[1:38:27] security you see years ago before our
[1:38:30] government set up the
[1:38:33] FDIC whenever a bank would go bankrupt
[1:38:36] and go under how much every investment
[1:38:39] you had in
[1:38:40] there there was no insurance to cover
[1:38:43] you but then once they started requiring
[1:38:46] these to set up brother Rob and some of
[1:38:49] his other brothers could certainly
[1:38:50] explain it much better than I could
[1:38:51] could then so much of your
[1:38:53] investment is going to be covered
[1:38:59] guaranteed well that's the way God
[1:39:01] wanted to do he said tell you what I'm
[1:39:02] going to do I'm going to set me up an FD
[1:39:07] IC future deity incarnated in a Corporal
[1:39:18] body woo man that was a good with it
[1:39:22] praise the Lord deity Incorporated
[1:39:26] hidden inside of a human
[1:39:29] body praise the Lord and God said once I
[1:39:33] put that seal on there there ain't no
[1:39:35] devil there ain't no sin there ain't no
[1:39:38] lying there ain't no adultery there
[1:39:40] ain't nothing else I guarantee your
[1:39:43] destiny I guarantee you Hallelujah come
[1:39:47] hell or high water or no water or
[1:39:49] anything else if if I put that seal on
[1:39:52] your soul who is the guarantor almighty
[1:39:56] God almighty God sickness disease
[1:40:00] heartache and trouble it ain't got
[1:40:02] nothing to say because God says I stand
[1:40:06] behind my seal and God said I deposit in
[1:40:11] every one of my children the true
[1:40:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost they will come
[1:40:16] through in Wesley's age in Luther's age
[1:40:19] in the lean age they will be there I
[1:40:23] guarantee it
[1:40:25] [Applause]
[1:40:34] personally it's more than a sensation
[1:40:37] it's more than speaking in tongues it's
[1:40:39] more than shouting in the spirit it's
[1:40:41] more than weeping it's more than joining
[1:40:43] the
[1:40:44] church it's God living in
[1:40:47] men
[1:40:48] deity God tab
[1:40:52] barnacled into that
[1:40:58] person
[1:41:01] wow you all you understand what I'm
[1:41:04] saying that there's there's
[1:41:07] times when you sense it so real and his
[1:41:10] presence is so
[1:41:13] awesome you ever feel like there's
[1:41:15] someone in you looking
[1:41:19] out
[1:41:23] that's why when I get under the
[1:41:24] anointing and preaching and praying for
[1:41:26] the sick and stuff I wish I never had to
[1:41:31] leave because there's
[1:41:33] times it's like I feel someone in me
[1:41:37] using my
[1:41:39] eyes someone using my
[1:41:42] mouth using my
[1:41:47] hands and then when that anointing backs
[1:41:50] away
[1:41:51] it's like I'm me again and I know some
[1:41:54] of you think I'm crazy and you're
[1:41:56] already going to think it now but I'll
[1:41:58] tell you what it is it's my deposit
[1:42:01] coming to the
[1:42:03] Forefront
[1:42:06] Hallelujah and the depositor is wanting
[1:42:08] to say I want Glory out of this service

[1:42:26] wants to take that part that he's placed
[1:42:28] inside of us this is his investment not
[1:42:31] ours he invested in us and he wants to
[1:42:34] use it why to make himself more glorious
[1:42:38] each person you witness every person
[1:42:40] that say how do they go through what
[1:42:42] they go through how do they stand how
[1:42:44] are they able to even get up in the
[1:42:46] morning they're under such stuff you
[1:42:48] understand what just happened they were
[1:42:50] able to see the depositor's life in your
[1:42:53] life and say it must be God that's
[1:42:55] strengthening them and he got more glory
[1:42:58] in the middle of your
[1:43:00] trial that's
[1:43:03] right oh my
[1:43:06] lord it's God living in men deity God

[1:44:32] rock under the impact of it Lord if you
[1:44:37] can only find
[1:44:39] people who are
[1:44:42] willing to wait upon the
[1:44:48] Lord hallelujah
[1:44:56] Hallelujah brother sister jum over just
[1:44:58] a little bit Colossians chapter 1
[1:45:00] ver14 give me a few more minutes I'm
[1:45:02] going to share this with you and whom we
[1:45:05] have
[1:45:06] Redemption through his
[1:45:08] blood even the Forgiveness of sins you
[1:45:11] see in the Old Testament the
[1:45:13] law of Ransom stated in Exodus 13:13 and
[1:45:18] also Exodus 34
[1:45:22] 20 every firstborn male as well as the
[1:45:26] humans and also of the
[1:45:29] donkey must be
[1:45:32] redeemed now in Numbers Chapter 3 there
[1:45:36] were
[1:45:38] 22,000
[1:45:40] Levites that became the
[1:45:44] substitutes for Israel's
[1:45:48] firstborn so when they number all the
[1:45:51] firstborn among the 12 tribes of
[1:45:54] Israel there were over
[1:45:57] 22,000 of
[1:45:59] them so God says I will take the
[1:46:04] Levites because initially the firstborn
[1:46:08] of the family would be the tribes or
[1:46:10] they would be the ones that would be the
[1:46:12] priest they would have the sacrifice
[1:46:15] they would do all the order but God said
[1:46:18] I will substitute
[1:46:21] and I will take a
[1:46:24] levite and substitute for your firstborn
[1:46:28] so say your firstborn son every one of
[1:46:30] you that had firstborn son it belonged
[1:46:33] to God so he would have to leave your
[1:46:35] home and go into service of the
[1:46:38] Lord but God said all right I'll take
[1:46:42] the
[1:46:43] Levites in
[1:46:45] substitution for your
[1:46:47] firstborn and the
[1:46:49] Levites will redeem the
[1:46:52] rights of your
[1:46:54] firstborn to live at
[1:46:57] home you can read this if you wish in
[1:47:00] Numbers Chapter
[1:47:01] 3 but now notice so there was there was
[1:47:06] these the Levites they only totaled
[1:47:10] 22,000 but there were
[1:47:14] 22,000
[1:47:16] 273
[1:47:19] firstborn
[1:47:21] so you've got a
[1:47:25] deficit but our King knows how to make
[1:47:28] up for
[1:47:30] deficits so you've got you understand
[1:47:32] you follow my thought so you've got
[1:47:35] 22,277 firstborn among all the tribes
[1:47:38] but you've only got 22,000 Levites so
[1:47:41] you've got
[1:47:43] 273 that there's not a levite to
[1:47:45] represent
[1:47:47] them but notice God's plan
[1:47:52] God
[1:47:53] said I will
[1:47:56] accept the
[1:47:58] money of the
[1:48:01] Tabernacle which was a total of
[1:48:05] 1,365
[1:48:08] shekels so God allowed
[1:48:12] money to be used in
[1:48:15] exchange for the
[1:48:18] firstborn now once again this parallel
[1:48:20] in 1st Samuel chapter
[1:48:22] 14 Jonathan came under the sentence of
[1:48:26] death of his father for transgressing an
[1:48:30] oath which he did not hear Saul make now
[1:48:34] Saul said any man that eats of this day
[1:48:37] takes one bite of anything he'll
[1:48:41] die well Jonathan was not there whenever
[1:48:43] the oath was
[1:48:45] made but King Saul condemned his son to
[1:48:49] die without even knowing it but the
[1:48:53] sentence was not carried
[1:48:55] out now listen the sentence was not
[1:49:00] carried
[1:49:01] out and here is the mystery the answer
[1:49:04] to the mystery of why it was
[1:49:06] not now Saul said whoever does this is
[1:49:09] going to die so that was the law of the
[1:49:13] king but notice what happens and the
[1:49:15] people said unto Saul shall Jonathan die
[1:49:17] who has wrought this great salvation in
[1:49:19] Israel God forbid as the Lord liveth
[1:49:21] there shall not one hand of his head
[1:49:23] fall to the ground for he has wrought
[1:49:25] with God this day so the
[1:49:29] people
[1:49:31] rescued
[1:49:35] Jonathan
[1:49:38] rescued I'm telling you one thing I had
[1:49:41] myself a holy ghost
[1:49:44] fit when I looked at the meaning of this
[1:49:48] word rescue
[1:49:53] glory to
[1:49:55] Ransom
[1:49:57] redeem
[1:50:00] deliver so the people just wanting it
[1:50:03] not to happen couldn't stop it now the
[1:50:05] Bible doesn't tell us exactly what they
[1:50:08] done but they either bought him or give
[1:50:12] an innocent
[1:50:14] substitute but it was enough to spare
[1:50:18] Jonathan's life from the law of the
[1:50:24] king the king said in that day that you
[1:50:27] eat thereof ye shall surely
[1:50:33] die there's only one way the law of the
[1:50:36] king could have an answer to allow Adam
[1:50:39] and Eve to live an innocent substitute
[1:50:42] must pay its
[1:50:43] price we too like
[1:50:46] Jonathan came under the Commandment of
[1:50:49] death
[1:50:51] Hallelujah to God
[1:50:53] condemned but yet God rich in Mercy amen
[1:50:59] God rich in Mercy allowed us to be rened
[1:51:04] I remember Jonathon was the first
[1:51:07] born so he could be redeemed and who
[1:51:10] redeemed him the people of
[1:51:15] Israel how do you know it won't be your
[1:51:18] prayers amen that'll touch that Wayward
[1:51:21] Son of
[1:51:22] yours that Wayward Daughter your mama
[1:51:25] your daddy let's Stand
[1:51:28] Together notice this and we'll close one
[1:51:32] of the
[1:51:34] names for
[1:51:36] money in the
[1:51:38] Hebrew is the Hebrew
[1:51:41] word damim d m I
[1:51:46] am one of the names used for money dine
[1:51:50] d m i m which is the plural form of
[1:51:57] Dom which is the word used for
[1:52:02] blood we've heard the the word for years
[1:52:05] of our lives in the English language
[1:52:08] Blood
[1:52:09] Money Right blood
[1:52:13] money so what did God do change the
[1:52:18] currency and it had to be changed into
[1:52:23] eternity and it come through this
[1:52:25] process and I've stood there and they'll
[1:52:27] ask for your
[1:52:29] passport your name and your
[1:52:31] identification and so on so how much
[1:52:33] there would you like to transfer well
[1:52:35] say $200 us okay well the transfer rate
[1:52:39] is so and so and then of course they
[1:52:41] charge you a fee for doing that well
[1:52:44] maybe if you come back through there in
[1:52:46] a week or 10 days or whatever more if
[1:52:48] you didn't spend it all
[1:52:50] you turn right back
[1:52:52] around and they charge you another fee
[1:52:55] for giving you back your money that you
[1:52:57] give them a week
[1:52:59] ago man so they get you coming and going
[1:53:03] don't
[1:53:04] they but if you want to have their
[1:53:08] currency this is the way you do
[1:53:11] it praise God so God
[1:53:16] said I
[1:53:18] need blood
[1:53:23] money don't
[1:53:25] M I need blood
[1:53:32] money so he couldn't come down here and
[1:53:34] make the
[1:53:37] transfer so it had to start from
[1:53:41] there so he thought of himself as
[1:53:44] becoming mortal he he wanted to be
[1:53:48] mortal so the transferal started in his
[1:53:53] thinking before the foundation of the
[1:53:57] world and the first glimpse of the
[1:53:59] transfer was actually made in the Garden
[1:54:02] of
[1:54:03] Eden when he made the man in his own
[1:54:07] image so he was Pro
[1:54:10] prophesying of a future blood money
[1:54:16] account praise
[1:54:18] God what is the Holy
[1:54:23] Ghost if you stand here tonight with it
[1:54:26] in your
[1:54:27] soul this ought to change you this
[1:54:30] sermon tonight for the rest of your life
[1:54:33] as long as you live on this
[1:54:36] Earth not that you have value in
[1:54:39] this value in your human lineage value
[1:54:43] in your family
[1:54:44] name but God has placed this great
[1:54:47] deposit inside of you
[1:54:53] amen he has invested this in you and
[1:54:57] every day you live whenever you feel
[1:55:00] like giving up and you think you can't
[1:55:01] make it another day but yet you came to
[1:55:04] church tonight some of you pressed
[1:55:06] beyond your feelings you made God more
[1:55:08] wealthy when you walked inside them
[1:55:11] doors you didn't feel like raising your
[1:55:13] hands just tired just weary you didn't
[1:55:15] feel like clapping you didn't feel like
[1:55:17] singing but she thought you know what
[1:55:20] I'm going to praise Him
[1:55:21] anyhow you added more wealth to his
[1:55:27] glory can you imagine that God is
[1:55:30] working with
[1:55:32] us and we are his
[1:55:35] representatives and we're adding to his
[1:55:38] weals in a way that
[1:55:40] Angels cannot
[1:55:44] do Lord have
[1:55:47] mercy children why wouldn't we want to
[1:55:49] give him in our
[1:55:50] life can you imagine when we stand there
[1:55:53] that day and the Lord Jesus will give us
[1:55:55] rewards man you're talking about the
[1:55:57] grace of God he gets inside of us and
[1:55:59] helps us do what we cannot do and then
[1:56:03] we stand before him that day and he turn
[1:56:05] around and rewards us for what we
[1:56:08] couldn't do in the first place and he
[1:56:10] got in us to do it and he sits there and
[1:56:12] rewards us for doing what he got in us
[1:56:14] to
[1:56:18] do and then whenever says oh God I want
[1:56:21] to hear these
[1:56:22] words more than anything else in the
[1:56:25] world well
[1:56:27] done my good and
[1:56:29] faithful
[1:56:31] servant enter
[1:56:33] in to the
[1:56:36] joys of the Lord which were prepared for
[1:56:40] you before the
[1:56:43] foundation of the
[1:56:46] world I want him to look me in the face
[1:56:48] and say Donnie
[1:56:50] or whatever my word name
[1:56:52] is you made me
[1:56:57] Rich you gave me your
[1:57:02] life or you say Brother D I want
[1:57:04] scripture for that well I'm glad you do
[1:57:06] I've got them don't you remember the
[1:57:08] parable of him giving them talents yeah
[1:57:11] and they give him the one Talent he went
[1:57:12] out and used it and made more and add to
[1:57:14] his Lord's Wells and remember the one
[1:57:17] that he gave one Talent what did he do
[1:57:19] is went out and buried it well I can't
[1:57:21] sing as good as so and so and I can't do
[1:57:23] this as good as so and so you ain't
[1:57:25] going to get Bible that you're going to
[1:57:26] answer to him who gave you that one
[1:57:28] Talent what he wants you to do make
[1:57:32] more make
[1:57:35] more praise
[1:57:37] God let's pray
[1:57:44] together oh my
[1:57:48] Lord
[1:57:51] who are we poor
[1:57:54] Mortals this night to stand in this
[1:57:58] place and be allowed to hear what we
[1:58:01] have heard in this last
[1:58:04] days dear God sending us a prophet with
[1:58:07] a message that would restore our hearts
[1:58:09] back to the original
[1:58:12] Faith Having the Holy Ghost which the
[1:58:14] Bible says which things the Angels
[1:58:17] desire to look into
[1:58:22] I imagine when the seals were being
[1:58:25] broke in March of 1963 the angels of God
[1:58:30] were under such
[1:58:33] anticipation at every
[1:58:36] service for they themselves were hearing
[1:58:39] for the first
[1:58:41] time some of the mystery of
[1:58:46] God they saw it in symbol and all of
[1:58:50] that but you never
[1:58:53] committed
[1:58:55] Hallelujah packing the seed to
[1:58:58] Angels but to
[1:59:01] humans help us
[1:59:05] Jesus help
[1:59:08] us Lord God I don't know how much longer
[1:59:10] I have on this Earth but I
[1:59:12] want one every
[1:59:15] day to count for
[1:59:18] you I want every day Lord
[1:59:21] God how much every time I have
[1:59:25] left Lord Jesus may my life be used for
[1:59:29] your
[1:59:30] glory I gave you my teens my 20s my 30s
[1:59:34] my 40s my 50s now I'm way up into my
[1:59:39] 60s if I have 70s or 80s or whatever I
[1:59:42] have left I want to give you all of
[1:59:46] it may you take your investment ment in
[1:59:49] my
[1:59:51] life may it bring
[1:59:54] Souls so if one would come tonight One
[1:59:57] Soul would be help by this
[1:59:59] sermon how many worlds would it be
[2:00:04] worth oh Jesus help us
[2:00:08] father help
[2:00:10] us and there's some people here tonight
[2:00:12] and they say well I'm not a preacher I
[2:00:14] can't do this and that and the other and
[2:00:16] that's true but maybe you'll put it on
[2:00:18] somebody heart to go
[2:00:20] overseas maybe that preacher don't have
[2:00:22] the money to be able to buy his own
[2:00:24] ticket but you'll put it on the heart of
[2:00:25] a businessman that can help him bu
[2:00:28] it how many of souls are going to be one
[2:00:31] at that day and stand before you not
[2:00:34] only with that preacher get credit but
[2:00:37] that brother who'll help buy that ticket
[2:00:39] will be as
[2:00:40] well because you made want a preacher
[2:00:43] you made another a businessman you made
[2:00:45] another and a prayer Warrior maybe that
[2:00:48] prayer Warrior didn't have enough money
[2:00:50] to help buy the plane ticket but while
[2:00:52] the brother was gone praying that
[2:00:55] brother prayed him through this storm
[2:00:56] and that storm and this turbulence over
[2:00:59] the Pacific and this turbulence over
[2:01:03] Africa oh how you want your children to
[2:01:06] stand there and not a one of them
[2:01:09] empty-handed even our sisters will stand
[2:01:12] there which are not
[2:01:14] preachers but you gave them a great
[2:01:16] position and called them the Fifth
[2:01:18] Gospel those that are
[2:01:21] mothers so you want none of your
[2:01:23] children to stand there embarrassed or
[2:01:27] humiliated so if we will let you you
[2:01:29] will work your investment out of our
[2:01:33] life and then those that we lead to you
[2:01:36] your Prophet has told us that name will
[2:01:39] be identified with us through
[2:01:43] eternity I know Lord there's people that
[2:01:46] I've led to you around the world and
[2:01:49] people in my Ministry that's got the
[2:01:50] Holy Ghost I know of different ones of
[2:01:53] them around the world and there's just
[2:01:55] that Bond there and I still hear from
[2:01:56] them from time to time Brother Don you
[2:01:58] remember that Youth Camp you remember
[2:02:00] this brother darl these other brothers
[2:02:01] can relate to it because there just
[2:02:04] something about it you have a an
[2:02:07] affinity with them
[2:02:08] somehow it's that little deposit from
[2:02:11] the realm of Eternity anchoring down
[2:02:14] here in
[2:02:15] time oh Jesus take us Lord
[2:02:21] uses no telling what I'd have been if
[2:02:23] you hadn't found

[2:02:39] them lived awful
[2:02:42] lives no doubt that was in mine and
[2:02:45] Harry's
[2:02:47] DNA but thank you there was a thought
[2:02:51] that overrode our Earthly
[2:02:55] inheritance no doubt I'd already been
[2:02:58] dead somewhere I'd wound up being a
[2:03:01] drunk wound up hurting my precious Jewel
[2:03:04] of a wife you gave
[2:03:06] me but you had another thought of
[2:03:10] me and you said oh

[2:03:46] transfer and changed over the currents
[2:03:50] which was his
[2:03:52] logos into human
[2:03:55] form so that that could be
[2:03:58] paid and he ascended up and he said I'll
[2:04:02] not leave you comfortless but I'll come
[2:04:04] back
[2:04:06] again so again he changed the
[2:04:10] currency into an indwelling
[2:04:13] form the Son of God the baptism of the
[2:04:16] Holy
[2:04:17] Ghost
[2:04:19] and he Saidi never leave you and I'll
