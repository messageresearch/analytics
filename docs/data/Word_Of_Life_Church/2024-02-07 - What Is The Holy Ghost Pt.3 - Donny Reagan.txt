house we long for that hour father we're so thankful that you've made a way that we can be accepted in your presence I pray as we Endeavor to look into your great Plan of Redemption tonight that you open your word to us once again make it make it more real to our hearts father we thank you Lord for all that you've done for us and what you're going to do bless the service be mindful of the needs of your people we ask in Jesus name amen ain't it good to be in the house of the Lord amen Colossians chapter 1 verse 25 what is the Holy Ghost what is it I want you to listen carefully to these verses that we're going to read tonight these are some of my favorite scriptures and all the Bible Colossians 1:25 whereof I am made a minister now this is Paul talking about of course what God has dispensed to him in his charge or under his care this is the only way God calls his men now these are the scriptures just for Paul alone but it be for every true God called man some men were sent and others just went but I want you to notice how Paul says this whereof I am made I'm made made a minister not desired to be not thought it would be a good vocation not thought it I could get a lot of money out of it but I was made a minister according to what according to the dispensation of God so God dispenses we all know what a dispensary is right we all know what a dispensary is during times of covid we put our hands under the alcohol and whatever more and whenever you do it activates it it dispenses something to kill the germs on your hands so a gospel preacher is like a dispenser and his size is according to God's Own plan and what he has in him to dispense is according to God's Own plan so Paul says according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you this is why preachers are even called you're not you're not sent here for me I'm sent here for you am right which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which hasth been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known listen this next verse oh it's just awesome to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of of this mystery to whom God would make known The Riches of the glory of this mystery so there's actually riches in the glory of this mystery that God wanted to make known The Riches of the glory of this mystery now I know I give you the meaning of a lot of words and I just hope that it helps you the way that it helps me to understand it a little bit better so look at the word here mystery it's the Greek word musterion which is a hidden thing religious Secrets confided only to the initiated not to ordinary Mortals we are some kind of blst aren't we so it's only given to the initiated not to ordinary Mortals the meaning goes on a hidden or secret thing not obvious to the understanding a hidden purpose or counsel secret will of God the secret counsels which govern God in dealing with the righteous which are hidden from ungodly and wicked men but plain to The Godly I feel like a rich man tonight praise the Lord now to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory and notice the riches in this verse are not the riches of the mystery but the riches are actually The Riches of the glory of the mystery The Riches of the glory so what Paul is expanding on here is that and the glory that's on this mystery so the mystery is so phenomenal that from this mystery emanates the shakina of God and the riches are coming from the abundance of that Glory of this mystery so brother Donnie what is the mystery here it is among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory praise the Lord ain't that awesome we're going to pray again over the word um I'm sure that some of you know and maybe some of you don't but my son-in-law Lance is is in the hospital and he's been really really sick he's was diagnosed with the flu he's also been diagnosed with pancreatitis he also has a blood clot in the spleen and a blood clot in the portal from the liver to the pancreas and uh he really really needs prayer his numbers yesterday the lipas which has to deal with the pancreas was about 2,00 th000 um but the doctor told him today that it had come down to 700 but whenever it reaches 700 you're still in critical condition so his was 2,000 so you can imagine how bad that it was so they're treating him with blood thinner of course for the blood clots and then also different things that they're doing for the uh you know for the other so would you just remember him in prayer that the Lord would just be with him and and help him he's in Sycamore shows there and they put him put him on the third floor right across the room from where Erica had passed away so that made it a little bit hard going up there so just remembering with that too we know there's nothing too big for our God are they anybody have a request you'd like to make known to the Saints in that as we pray God bless you let's just bow our heads together again father thank you for the reading of your word Lord God we're asking you that You' just be mindful of all these needs that were signified by the uplifting of the hand father you also see Lance in the hospital tonight I'm sure he's streaming right now we're asking Lord and believing together that you'd send your presence there in the room where he is we thank you that the numbers have come down but they're still critically high in the name of Jesus may it come down even lower father you see these blood clots you know the cause of them we're praying dear God that you would just move you see Lord he was supposed to have a hernia surgery he's not going to be able to have that right now because of it so he's got several things that's going on but we're believing you your mighty hand would just move for him strengthen him you see father he's still trying to get over Erica's hom going and then these things hit him too but we believe out of these things you will produce a man that'll be stronger than he's ever been in his entire walk with God speak to us tonight from your word father I am your servant reporting for Duty take my mouth I submit my mind my body my soul to your presence speak through me tonight Lord God I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask praise the Lord and the saint said amen amen God bless you you may be seated to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory us being Gentiles we certainly Rejoice that this gospel come to us but I wonder if we we really have an idea of what it cost Paul to preach to us you see if Paul would have preached these wonderful things only to the Jews it would have eliminated so many problems that he had in life most of his persecution was brought on by the Jews for several years so if he would have only preached things that the Jews would have wanted him to hear no doubt they would have absolutely loved the understanding that God gave this man but instead of holding his peace and just preaching things that would make everybody happy boy am I glad tonight that he went beyond the court of the Jews and preached to us bunch of dogs anybody else happy with me tonight now the mystery that Paul saw quite unlike Peter unlike our precious brother James brother James never did really see it the way that Paul did the pastor of the church in Jerusalem never did really Venture that far out no record historically or in the scripture that he ever went and visited or preached to the Gentile churches you all I don't think there'll be any of us that'll stand there that day though and condemn James because he never reached out to us men can only preach what God shows them and if they're doing all they know to do then I'm so glad God will judge them only by that aren't you but there was some like this man that was given such an Open Door into what God had done I love the way that he he writes this and when you study these men the way that they wrote you can find a certain style you see it with Matthew Matthew projected Jesus as the Son of Man Mark projected him of course as the Son of God and Luke more as the son of David but John projected him as the logos so whenever each one of of them would write and you study the way that they would write same way any of us us would each officer would have a certain thing about them they would have a certain Rhythm and they would have a way that they would use verbs and adverbs and adjectives and so on and once you learn Paul style it it's beautiful it's absolutely beautiful in the way that he does and and he would take these Hebrew words and when he wanted to emphasize a phrase he would build one word on top of another on top of another in order to make this this word that he's wanting to emphasize such an accumulative word that the writers and the the readers in that day that understood this language they must have been overwhelmed because they knew this poine as they call it style and they knew by the way he was layering it with one word after another he was building it up to the crescendo so you imagine when they begin to read this in Colossians and they were blessed by the understanding of what Paul had said so he he accumulates phrase on top of phrase on top of phrase to come to this greatness of what God had done and then he uses this word riches which is a common word I don't know if you've ever noticed it or not but it was as we are very familiar with the word thread today and there will be threads that will be run on certain chats and you know threads on Instagram and all that sort of thing and Paul did the same thing so he would use certain words to be able to be able to expound on the wisdom of God and the grace of God and the mercy of God and he would use certain words when he would want to make it so great and so expound upon them and the word riches was one of those words that Paul used over and over again but he was not using them in a way that we would think naturally that the riches was about your house your cattle you know your acreage your land but it was about the good things that God God had bestowed upon his people and he used the word riches to Define that and to be able to build and bring it to the people where they would be able to see hey hey I got an idea why don't we take a little journey tonight and we'll what we will do we will walk into the bank of heaven and each of us will pull out our account with our name and our number on it and we'll take a little trip through the scriptures and we'll open up and see how rich We Are Tonight now maybe if you were to do that on your phone many of you maybe you Bank online and you'd be able to open it up and type in your password and all that or maybe you've got a face image and you could do it and instantaneously you would be able to find how much you've got in your checking account your CD your savings and on and on and on depending on how much you've got you might look in there and see that you're overdrawn you might look in there and your account would actually produce a very nervous type of feeling because you know you've got another two or three checks that's going to come in and you know sure as the world they're going to bounce and they're going to cost you $25 a piece but let me just tell you before we open our account tonight by face recognition none of us are going to be overdrawn as a matter of fact there won't be a one of us that'll have to walk away nervous tonight afraid that the checks are going to ride on healing or Deliverance or peace or power or salvation are going to be overdrawn we can walk away from here tonight with great confidence that every check you write from from now on will be covered by the mercy of God look with me in the Book of Romans chapter 2 verse 4 or despises thou The Riches of his goodness and forbearing and longsuffering goodness goodness forbearance and longsuffering and yet Paul identifies them as riches so it isn't like that God has just a little bit and then God is overdrawn and and God you know to to think that God has been longsuffering and forbearing with man since the Garden of Eden but Paul wants us to know that the longsuffering of God and the goodness and the forbearance of God they are like an account that is so massive and has so much in there that they can never be overdrawn though Millions might be pulling from them they daily The Riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance now you see the lower the degradation of the Gentiles would prove the higher of the glory of God revealed in their lives and this is what that the Jews could not comprehend they could not see the one man that Paul wrote about in the New Testament when he talked about the mystery of the Jews and the Gentiles being converged together into the one new man that's the terms that he used and it just totally blinded the Jews they could not see that the Gentiles would ever be brought in anywhere close to where they were and they sure couldn't accept that they were going to be replaced by them they could not even grasp for comprehended and yet Paul said now those of you that are grafted in don't think it was because of your goodness it was the mercy of God is that right but yet here he he brings this so the lower the degradation of the Gentiles the higher the glory of God is going to bring them up so the expansion of the depths of sin that we was in the lowest hell and how God brings us what does it prove the riches of his Mercy because we were lower than the Jews we were not even a people we were a Godless people worshiping idols and heathens in idol worship and all kinds of stuff is that right so when the mystery is truly revealed in the Gentiles you can see why the glory of God will be so rich and it will mag be magnified in such a great way notice again in Romans 9: 23 that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy now this word glory is doca now we know that the glory of God is something no doubt most of us still yet understand very little about we can see the Shak as we call it shakan in English but that was what Moses wanted to look into and see the face of God and God only allowed him to see just a little small portion Ezekiel Saw a little bit of it few of the prophets were able to see it but it was the very Heart Of God that was going to be revealed in the mystery of Christ and God kept it hid from them until his heart was opened up and made manifest and it was something that no doubt we will be understanding as the ages go on now keep in mind it was hid from ages and generation but once it's being made known it will be revealed down through eternity as the ages still unfold now look what he said that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he had a four prepared unto Glory so there will be Riches of glor Glory that will be revealed on the vessels of Mercy wow what a name to call us by vessels of Mercy now not just vessels that receive Mercy but the mercy was so great we were actually changed into vessels of Mercy what we received was so profound that it actually changed us from just being recipient that were on the bottom of the totem polus we would say it so transformed us it renamed us it rearize everything about us and we're not just recipients of Mercy but we are actually vessels of Mercy which he had aor prepared unto Glory again Romans 11:33 oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God oh the depth of the riches notice he doesn't just say oh the depths of the wisdom and knowledge of God but all the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God and this is you know this is typical Pauline as would say because now the rest of the authors of the New Testament break into this but God allowed him to break into the bank of heaven and be able to walk in to the safe as it were and see that every believer had an account and they had a personal safety deposit box in Christ Jesus and it's like Paul was carried into it to see this is a treasure Trove of riches of the glory of God of the wisdom of God of the forbearance of God of the longsuffering of God so it's not something that God is you know coming with pain the pain is over friends his pain is what unleashed the treasure to you and I as the people of God it's no longer hurting the Lord Jesus to forgive you it's no longer hurting the Lord Jesus to give you mercy and kindness and forbearance I wish somebody would preach with me tonight but what is it it changed from Pain to Glory it chained from a crowning of the Thorns it's pointing to the time when we as the saints of God will crown him king of kings and Lord of lords oh the depths of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out Ephesians 1:7 in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches according to the riches of his grace now you may be sitting here tonight and you may not have enough money to go through a drive-thru at at McDonald's at church and buy yourself a hamburger and a cold drink but you know what if you're in Christ Jesus you are one of the wealthiest Mortals that has ever lived on the face of the Earth don't feel sorry for yourself and don't let the devil tell you you ain't nobody and you ain't got nothing you need to start looking at your riches in Christ Jesus all in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches notice not just one attribute of Grace but the riches which is imp plurality The Riches of his grace in his grace is diverse riches do you understand that in the grace of God is one of the aspect of the riches is the Saving Grace when you were lost but then you needed another Grace which was sanctifying Grace you needed another Grace which was the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then the last Grace you're going to need is called rapturing Grace don't you understand the rapture is the consummation of the unfolding of the riches of God's grace how many still needs Grace in your day ever life well whenever you do that when you fall short of the glory of God or you need strength or encouraging when we're alive and our bodies are going to be changed what's it going to be it's going to be from the Vault of this channel of God's grace and God will allow us to be ministered to what rapturing is it amazing that it didn't call it rapturing this or rapturing that but he called it rapturing Grace why it's in the unfolding Riches of our God which will bring you to the higher phase of Glory now notice Paul says in whom we have this Redemption so he has redeemed us so to redeem was to purchase and set free by paying a price to purchase and set free by paying a price I found this in history and I thought i' thought to share it with you that there was 60 million slaves in the Roman Empire about the time that Paul wrote this 60 million slaves in the Roman Empire and they were bought and sold and they had no more value than than a piece of furniture or a horse or a cow oh how God hated such a deal but a man could buy a slave and set him free so if a man wanted to go out and he had all kinds of money and he had wealth and he'd go to the slave market and he'd buy a 100 or 200 or 500 or a th000 whatever he wanted and he would stand there and he would buy him then he could turn right around and give them from him as the owner absolute clearance on the deed of their life and make them totally free from slavery don't you understand that's what the Lord Jesus did to us we were slaves under sin we were born slaves we were born lost is that right and what did he do he come and redeemed us he paid a price this is why we are not our own we belong to the Lord Jesus well come on somebody your job your money your bank account your health your mouth your ears every you are belongs to Jesus Christ that's right so his blood paid the price and then he set us free Ephesians 1: 18 the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory help us Lord to see this please help us what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints do you understand what his inheritance is you my inheritance is him his inheritance it's me and I know what you're thinking you're thinking he sure got the bad end of the deal not the way he looks at it not the way he looks at it how could he come up with such an equation you see the value of it it's by the price that was paid so Carol has a little piece of CLA about this big cent Frank with a piece of clear glass on it it has a scripture on it it has a church building and it has some grass it was Handmade by someone I I would not take $100,000 for that tonight you want to know what cuz Erica made it so what gives it the value you've got things that you say oh they're Priceless no it's not for sale come on everything's for sale no it's not people may look at us oh my goodness I I knew them I I you know I know them now I know they still make mistakes they're for saleing Jesus would say they are not for sale they are Priceless you can't even set a value on them they are not for sale so what makes the value what makes the value well it depends on the buyer or plural buyers and the way they look at the value notice he says the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints so the riches in the glory of the inheritance of the Saints he himself will be paid back from the deposit and price he paid for us so where does he get his return it's all about the investment the investment increases the value of the goods being bought now if a rich man wanted to buy you know some kind of car or something other you know the these people are Wonder buy oh you know I'll pay 25 I'll pay I'll pay I'll pay 35,000 man that's a great buy but Ed on must walks in and he wants it 585,000 1.2 million well all of a sudden the value goes up why richest man in the world can buy pretty much whatever he wants to I guess but what if we move Beyond this world and we move into Eternity for the king of riches says I want a people I want a people like me I want a people who will love me more than anything else in this world world when I find them they'll be so lowly they'll be so rotten they'll be so degradated but I will pay such a price for them and when it strikes them finally what I've paid for them the value of what I paid will release them from the condemnation they experiened and they will have a super natural appraisal of their soul Glory they will get a supernal appraisal of their soul and realize in my sight they are Priceless the Saints themselves are the Lord's portion we talk about heaven and what all we're going to get we're going to get a mansion we're going to get streets of gold we're going to get this this this this this so what does he get he's the creator of golden streets but he don't want them he don't want Gates of pearl they're not for him he knows how women like pearls you reckon all this is being made for him that's not his law Terry look what in Deuteronomy 32:9 for the Lord's portion is his people and you say boy he he sure don't know how to make a deal I beg to differ with you he knows how to make a deal and the way he looks at it he's getting more than we are so what should you think he values the most his own blood or you so if you go to LongHorn Steakhouse you get to menu your favorite steak will say is the New York Street if you been there in a while they've raised the price on it again you look down to there and you say man do I want to pay $24.95 for that thank goodness gracious oh oh man I don't know do I you're setting out the menu on your hand here comes a waitress and she's taking one to the table right next to you I want the New York strip so what you did was you made a decision to trade off $26.95 or whatever it was for that Ser now if you go to Juniper you're going to pay even more than that and you say it's worth it there'll be other people in there and come sit down they'll order a hamburger and french fries cuz to them it ain't worth it you see there's where there's a lot of hamburger Christians they do not consider giving up this and giving up that and quitting this and quitting that just just to go to heaven just to be a child of God but the bride type they look at it and say whatever you want it's yours anything on my house you see you want take it anything in my house you see you don't like tell me I'll trash it anything you want me to do I'm Yours here's my life here's my children here's my grandchildren here's our church here's everything we are do with it as you please but you see the hamburger Christians said but what if he does something I don't want him to do and He will yeah but you see a real believer will commit to him and wipe the tears from their eyes when they watch him do it because they love him more than they love anything else in the world and he looks at that and he says oh there's my treasure because he looks at what you were Beyond Hope was no mercy no way for you to ever love him that way before he got to you it wasn't in you it wasn't in me but he looks at you and he makes a deposit and redeems you and buys you then he don't take you from the devil's chains and chain you up to him but he buys you and set you free and fills you with love and says I love you with all of my heart brother and I want you to love me the same way but not with a whip not chained we're not held by Steel any type of metal we're held by chains of Love they're invisible oh you imagine this amazing truth that God would look on us and consider us to be part of his great wealth and we look at ourselves as being an expenditure we look at ourselves as being this great debt you know that God has this great debt that he took on because of us he looks at it the exact opposite he said don't you understand you are making me wealthy you you are allowing me to express my glory through the riches of my mercy and the riches of my grace I'm spending of my mercy upon your life and I'm depositing my own election in you and as you respond to my grace I invest more in you and I'm getting more out I invest and I'm getting more out I invest and I'm getting more out we go to him in prayer oh God oh God I know you hate my guts I know God I know God you don't like me I know God I I've caus you so much pain he said darling shut up you're making me Rich you're making me more wealthy I don't know about you friend I've made the Lord Jesus more wealthy this Wednesday I've lived another life right in the middle of hell right in the middle of Satan's e and I've lived an overcoming life I've lived a Godly life I've lived a life that is pleasing to my Lord and it's not what I have done it's not what you have done but the riches of his grace has been deposited in my life and it has produced another another overcoming day for a child of God hallelujah that can stand here tonight and say greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world I have made my Lord more rich and more wealthy [Applause] today because of his investment just as a man's wealth bring glory to his name now think about it a man who would pick himself up by his bootstraps as we say and you know turn turned into a little small business or whatever more and he would turn into Be A Millionaire and people say wow that's a self-made man that that's a self-made man started out my you know down in the hills of wherever he was from and look at that guy I want you to look at what he's done so his wealth brings honor and glory to his name that ain't nothing in case you ain't checked lately inflation ain't good anybody been to the grocery store this week painful wasn't it hurt you bad is it biomics whoops whoops I ain't supposed to be preaching politics here we go inflation everything's going up except for your wages of course well come on somebody and you're taking less home as a matter of fact you've lost several hundred on your purchasing power in the last several years so your money is worth less and it takes more men car went through Weds other morning to get a little breakfast my Lord is 18 $1 and some I thought I didn't want to buy part interest in this in this place I just wanted two little sandwiches and two drinks are you kidding me I'm about to refinance my c e three times a day what in the world is going on well it's the economics of this world and our nation is going to fall flat on his face it's already busted you might as well say Amen but while the world is getting poor and poor the saints of God around the world are getting richer and richer we have lived another week in Satan's eeden and we have brought more wealth to our Lord we have prove he has an abundance of Mercy he has an abundance of Grace he has an abundance of forgiveness I want him to express his glory to my life don't you oh as a man's wealth will bring him glory so God will get Glory by his wealth being expressed in his church because of his investment you it's not you it's not me the whole key brother I thought you was preaching on what is the Holy Ghost I am this is what makes his wealth God changed himself into a form of spiritual currency traveling around the world most of the places that I've been most of them want US Dollars well I don't know since it's went down so much if they wanted as much anymore or not but I do used to that's what they want so when you go on the streets whether it been in Israel Africa wherever it is that have the black market guys now whenever you go into the airport if you want so many shekels which is Israeli money or if you want so much you know whatever it is Nation you're going into you can exchange it at the airport US Dollars and they'll give you a certain exchange rate but if you wait a little bit and get out on the streets there'll be some guys out there and they'll be wanting to exchange it for you and they'll use a little less so you actually get more of their money but for some of them you can only buy if you have their money well here we were we were in so much debt and God had the currency of deity and royalty but we couldn't have access to it so God had to change his currency format and become in a dispensable form now think about it what Paul said Christ in you the hope of glory Christ in you can you imagine every person you're tonight and every person around the world that has the Lord Jesus living in them with the true baptism of the Holy Ghost they actually have Christ in them you believe that Christ in you how is that even possible now notice Paul didn't say Jesus in you it's not the body of Jesus it's Christ what is Christ the dispensable form of God's presence which could be divided who would ever think about a being in such Eternal Realms that he would be able to divide himself into millions and millions of parts and he's just as great as he was before he started subdividing himself but it had to be changed into a form that could be got and spent and used so God was in Christ his human currency and in that form he could pay the price glory to God and then not only paid the price but on the day of Pentecost the same money that paid for you glory the same money would turn right back around in the form of the Holy Ghost and come back and live inside of you for the rest of your journey hallelujah amen So Not only was the money used to buy you out but he said now tell what I'm going to do I'm going to give you a little spending money on the way so I paid for you I bought you I set you free and here's your little spending money the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you need healing cash it in you need deliver cash it in because I am your spending money hallelujah praise God so our riches are in God God's riches are in US Ephesians 2:7 that in the ages to come listen now that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace and his kindness toward us through his human currency Christ Jesus that in the ages to come do you understand our father is so great and magnificent that in eternity he will still be unveiling himself glory be to God Ephesians 3:8 unto me who am less and the least of All Saints is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ verse 16 that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the Inner Man now listen carefully the Holy Ghost is your part of deity yes sir yes sir now remember the currency had to be changed into a form by which would be accepted for payment and also in case you needed anything along the way so you've got to have a vessel by which this currency can be compatible with so was it invisible had it been an invisible form then you'd never been able to got visibility around it so he changed himself to him who was invisible and become visible he merged the Two Worlds together the invisible and the visible met together in the currency Christ Jesus then the visible was made manifest and poured out the chemistry visible out of his body and broke open the blood cell visible and released the invisible the very life of God praise the Lord so he come to call all those whose names are written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world I know you don't remember it neither do I but we were a part of his godhead before the currency ever changed watch this the word made flesh they that are sons of God are led by the spirit of God then when the human element goes out and the spirit of God FS that vacancy where you empty yourself amen then will the church and its power the resurrection of the Lord Jesus walk in his steps in his power in his thoughts in his being in his moving you see what I mean then your thoughts become words and words will become material that's when the church is in its power I believe it's on the road that when the church will be so wrapped in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind will so away froms they don't see thems don't you understand this is why we need preaching like this to help us to see oursel in closer proximity of the way the father sees us you all the time looking at yourself some of you think you're worthless you ain't no good at all and the angels of God are standing there looking it ain't no wonder the angels are looking they're saying he's invested his whole wealth in them bunch of people how in the world can he he said that I am wey through them he ain't never said that about Gabriel he ain't never said that about the cheram he never said that about the universe God's inheritance is not the universe it's his [Applause] children don't you understand the universe never fell not the universe that was one Planet one out of the trillions one the one Adam lived on we have no other record that the others fell no other record that the others tilted on their AES 22 and a half degrees only the home of man Hallelujah notice this they just move in the spirit live in the spirit move in the spirit walk in the spirit Soul fulfill the law of Christ then the love of Christ and the move moving in the Holy Ghost that great wonderful Church listen this will go forth with power and deity because deity will be revealed in human beings so if I transfer money when I flew into B Bay years ago change the name of it now and I Chang US Dollars into their rupees some of these countries will not allow their residents to have US Dollars it's illegal for them so in order to help the poor I will change money sometimes because I know some of their loss so if I'm want to give anything to the poor I could have pocketfuls of $100 bills it won't do them one good at all because their government does not want them to have US Dollars you and I run to the government of the devil one day he didn't want us to have the Holy Ghost I don't blame him I don't blame him he didn't want us to have salvation he didn't want us to have sanctification he didn't want us to have revelation of the word so the Lord God said I'll change myself into a dispensable form by which the peasant and the pper on the street can be able to receive my inheritance and they can take that and go to the store and buy them something to eat and I've done it that way believe me so the poor on the street and me take money but you have to watch what you're doing cuz once they see you're giving it out they will AB absolutely throng you they are so poor and in such need they will throng you if they see you're giving out money if people would do that for money what about the Holy Ghost what about salvation what about eternal life Oh Glory look at it bruised wounded Tor opened up his side with a Roman spear in order that by the Holy Spirit we might be baptized into his body partakers of his divine nature you get it then you become a partaker after coming into his body a partaker of his divine nature Christ's nature and you how can you cheat steal lie backslide prolite do everything else with the divine nature of Christ in you it's impossible all our warnings and our fussing and steings and arguing and tempers all these things pass away you see it what is the fruit of the spirit we planted it on the church membership upon shouting upon demonstrations of works but the fruit of the spirit is first love love who then is when you love those who are unlovable let's jump down to the next one here the testimony of a true witness the Holy Ghost the witness of God what is it deity tabernacled in men yes sir deity how many believes it again he said church that's the reason I can't take the baptism of the Holy Ghost of crying shaking speaking in tongues or any sensation they're all right now them things are all right but the devil can impersonate that so real but the Holy Ghost is deity God tabernacled in Men He Knows by doing this and his investment is hidden by eternal [Laughter] security you see years ago before our government set up the FDIC whenever a bank would go bankrupt and go under how much every investment you had in there there was no insurance to cover you but then once they started requiring these to set up brother Rob and some of his other brothers could certainly explain it much better than I could could then so much of your investment is going to be covered guaranteed well that's the way God wanted to do he said tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to set me up an FD IC future deity incarnated in a Corporal body woo man that was a good with it praise the Lord deity Incorporated hidden inside of a human body praise the Lord and God said once I put that seal on there there ain't no devil there ain't no sin there ain't no lying there ain't no adultery there ain't nothing else I guarantee your destiny I guarantee you Hallelujah come hell or high water or no water or anything else if if I put that seal on your soul who is the guarantor almighty God almighty God sickness disease heartache and trouble it ain't got nothing to say because God says I stand behind my seal and God said I deposit in every one of my children the true baptism of the Holy Ghost they will come through in Wesley's age in Luther's age in the lean age they will be there I guarantee it [Applause] personally it's more than a sensation it's more than speaking in tongues it's more than shouting in the spirit it's more than weeping it's more than joining the church it's God living in men deity God tab barnacled into that person wow you all you understand what I'm saying that there's there's times when you sense it so real and his presence is so awesome you ever feel like there's someone in you looking out that's why when I get under the anointing and preaching and praying for the sick and stuff I wish I never had to leave because there's times it's like I feel someone in me using my eyes someone using my mouth using my hands and then when that anointing backs away it's like I'm me again and I know some of you think I'm crazy and you're already going to think it now but I'll tell you what it is it's my deposit coming to the Forefront Hallelujah and the depositor is wanting to say I want Glory out of this service and you get out of the way you ain't getting none of it ony and I said that's fine with me sir I don't want no glory no h and God say I I I want to use this singer I I want to use this musician I want to use this person I want to use that oh can you imagine friend that God wants to take that part that he's placed inside of us this is his investment not ours he invested in us and he wants to use it why to make himself more glorious each person you witness every person that say how do they go through what they go through how do they stand how are they able to even get up in the morning they're under such stuff you understand what just happened they were able to see the depositor's life in your life and say it must be God that's strengthening them and he got more glory in the middle of your trial that's right oh my lord it's God living in men deity God himself tabernacled in that person when he can speak dear Lord and it's just the same as God speak that's the Church of Jesus Christ God fill us with our with deity was our with with deity fill us with power and energy you ever feel like sometimes you just need to be re-energized fill us with power and energy until our souls are a flame that our strength will be him our testimony will be God our words will be his Devils will tremble the world will shake and rock under the impact of it Lord if you can only find people who are willing to wait upon the Lord hallelujah Hallelujah brother sister jum over just a little bit Colossians chapter 1 ver14 give me a few more minutes I'm going to share this with you and whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins you see in the Old Testament the law of Ransom stated in Exodus 13:13 and also Exodus 34 20 every firstborn male as well as the humans and also of the donkey must be redeemed now in Numbers Chapter 3 there were 22,000 Levites that became the substitutes for Israel's firstborn so when they number all the firstborn among the 12 tribes of Israel there were over 22,000 of them so God says I will take the Levites because initially the firstborn of the family would be the tribes or they would be the ones that would be the priest they would have the sacrifice they would do all the order but God said I will substitute and I will take a levite and substitute for your firstborn so say your firstborn son every one of you that had firstborn son it belonged to God so he would have to leave your home and go into service of the Lord but God said all right I'll take the Levites in substitution for your firstborn and the Levites will redeem the rights of your firstborn to live at home you can read this if you wish in Numbers Chapter 3 but now notice so there was there was these the Levites they only totaled 22,000 but there were 22,000 273 firstborn so you've got a deficit but our King knows how to make up for deficits so you've got you understand you follow my thought so you've got 22,277 firstborn among all the tribes but you've only got 22,000 Levites so you've got 273 that there's not a levite to represent them but notice God's plan God said I will accept the money of the Tabernacle which was a total of 1,365 shekels so God allowed money to be used in exchange for the firstborn now once again this parallel in 1st Samuel chapter 14 Jonathan came under the sentence of death of his father for transgressing an oath which he did not hear Saul make now Saul said any man that eats of this day takes one bite of anything he'll die well Jonathan was not there whenever the oath was made but King Saul condemned his son to die without even knowing it but the sentence was not carried out now listen the sentence was not carried out and here is the mystery the answer to the mystery of why it was not now Saul said whoever does this is going to die so that was the law of the king but notice what happens and the people said unto Saul shall Jonathan die who has wrought this great salvation in Israel God forbid as the Lord liveth there shall not one hand of his head fall to the ground for he has wrought with God this day so the people rescued Jonathan rescued I'm telling you one thing I had myself a holy ghost fit when I looked at the meaning of this word rescue glory to Ransom redeem deliver so the people just wanting it not to happen couldn't stop it now the Bible doesn't tell us exactly what they done but they either bought him or give an innocent substitute but it was enough to spare Jonathan's life from the law of the king the king said in that day that you eat thereof ye shall surely die there's only one way the law of the king could have an answer to allow Adam and Eve to live an innocent substitute must pay its price we too like Jonathan came under the Commandment of death Hallelujah to God condemned but yet God rich in Mercy amen God rich in Mercy allowed us to be rened I remember Jonathon was the first born so he could be redeemed and who redeemed him the people of Israel how do you know it won't be your prayers amen that'll touch that Wayward Son of yours that Wayward Daughter your mama your daddy let's Stand Together notice this and we'll close one of the names for money in the Hebrew is the Hebrew word damim d m I am one of the names used for money dine d m i m which is the plural form of Dom which is the word used for blood we've heard the the word for years of our lives in the English language Blood Money Right blood money so what did God do change the currency and it had to be changed into eternity and it come through this process and I've stood there and they'll ask for your passport your name and your identification and so on so how much there would you like to transfer well say $200 us okay well the transfer rate is so and so and then of course they charge you a fee for doing that well maybe if you come back through there in a week or 10 days or whatever more if you didn't spend it all you turn right back around and they charge you another fee for giving you back your money that you give them a week ago man so they get you coming and going don't they but if you want to have their currency this is the way you do it praise God so God said I need blood money don't M I need blood money so he couldn't come down here and make the transfer so it had to start from there so he thought of himself as becoming mortal he he wanted to be mortal so the transferal started in his thinking before the foundation of the world and the first glimpse of the transfer was actually made in the Garden of Eden when he made the man in his own image so he was Pro prophesying of a future blood money account praise God what is the Holy Ghost if you stand here tonight with it in your soul this ought to change you this sermon tonight for the rest of your life as long as you live on this Earth not that you have value in this value in your human lineage value in your family name but God has placed this great deposit inside of you amen he has invested this in you and every day you live whenever you feel like giving up and you think you can't make it another day but yet you came to church tonight some of you pressed beyond your feelings you made God more wealthy when you walked inside them doors you didn't feel like raising your hands just tired just weary you didn't feel like clapping you didn't feel like singing but she thought you know what I'm going to praise Him anyhow you added more wealth to his glory can you imagine that God is working with us and we are his representatives and we're adding to his weals in a way that Angels cannot do Lord have mercy children why wouldn't we want to give him in our life can you imagine when we stand there that day and the Lord Jesus will give us rewards man you're talking about the grace of God he gets inside of us and helps us do what we cannot do and then we stand before him that day and he turn around and rewards us for what we couldn't do in the first place and he got in us to do it and he sits there and rewards us for doing what he got in us to do and then whenever says oh God I want to hear these words more than anything else in the world well done my good and faithful servant enter in to the joys of the Lord which were prepared for you before the foundation of the world I want him to look me in the face and say Donnie or whatever my word name is you made me Rich you gave me your life or you say Brother D I want scripture for that well I'm glad you do I've got them don't you remember the parable of him giving them talents yeah and they give him the one Talent he went out and used it and made more and add to his Lord's Wells and remember the one that he gave one Talent what did he do is went out and buried it well I can't sing as good as so and so and I can't do this as good as so and so you ain't going to get Bible that you're going to answer to him who gave you that one Talent what he wants you to do make more make more praise God let's pray together oh my Lord who are we poor Mortals this night to stand in this place and be allowed to hear what we have heard in this last days dear God sending us a prophet with a message that would restore our hearts back to the original Faith Having the Holy Ghost which the Bible says which things the Angels desire to look into I imagine when the seals were being broke in March of 1963 the angels of God were under such anticipation at every service for they themselves were hearing for the first time some of the mystery of God they saw it in symbol and all of that but you never committed Hallelujah packing the seed to Angels but to humans help us Jesus help us Lord God I don't know how much longer I have on this Earth but I want one every day to count for you I want every day Lord God how much every time I have left Lord Jesus may my life be used for your glory I gave you my teens my 20s my 30s my 40s my 50s now I'm way up into my 60s if I have 70s or 80s or whatever I have left I want to give you all of it may you take your investment ment in my life may it bring Souls so if one would come tonight One Soul would be help by this sermon how many worlds would it be worth oh Jesus help us father help us and there's some people here tonight and they say well I'm not a preacher I can't do this and that and the other and that's true but maybe you'll put it on somebody heart to go overseas maybe that preacher don't have the money to be able to buy his own ticket but you'll put it on the heart of a businessman that can help him bu it how many of souls are going to be one at that day and stand before you not only with that preacher get credit but that brother who'll help buy that ticket will be as well because you made want a preacher you made another a businessman you made another and a prayer Warrior maybe that prayer Warrior didn't have enough money to help buy the plane ticket but while the brother was gone praying that brother prayed him through this storm and that storm and this turbulence over the Pacific and this turbulence over Africa oh how you want your children to stand there and not a one of them empty-handed even our sisters will stand there which are not preachers but you gave them a great position and called them the Fifth Gospel those that are mothers so you want none of your children to stand there embarrassed or humiliated so if we will let you you will work your investment out of our life and then those that we lead to you your Prophet has told us that name will be identified with us through eternity I know Lord there's people that I've led to you around the world and people in my Ministry that's got the Holy Ghost I know of different ones of them around the world and there's just that Bond there and I still hear from them from time to time Brother Don you remember that Youth Camp you remember this brother darl these other brothers can relate to it because there just something about it you have a an affinity with them somehow it's that little deposit from the realm of Eternity anchoring down here in time oh Jesus take us Lord uses no telling what I'd have been if you hadn't found me lot of them on both sides of my family Lord the men run around on their wives they drank went to premature Graves some of them lived awful lives no doubt that was in mine and Harry's DNA but thank you there was a thought that overrode our Earthly inheritance no doubt I'd already been dead somewhere I'd wound up being a drunk wound up hurting my precious Jewel of a wife you gave me but you had another thought of me and you said oh no I'll break that Reagan cycle I'll break that sh cycle hallelujah hallelujah We Worship You Jesus can we just lift our hands friends in the presence of God oh Jesus We Worship You Lord God made the transfer and changed over the currents which was his logos into human form so that that could be paid and he ascended up and he said I'll not leave you comfortless but I'll come back again so again he changed the currency into an indwelling form the Son of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he Saidi never leave you and I'll never forsake you I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus I just feel like recommitting my life tonight to the Lord anybody in here like to join me you got singing abilities musician abilities praying whatever you have would you
