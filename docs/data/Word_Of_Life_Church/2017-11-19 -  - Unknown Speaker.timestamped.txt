[16:54] where's the Lord Church Amen we believe
[16:59] that maybe that's not just a good song
[17:02] but that song was inspired by somebody

[17:18] why are you singing
[17:20] hallelujah because we're gonna be there
[17:22] with him amen amen praise the Lord we

[18:14] help but show up
[18:18] hallelujah so if you do your part
[18:21] he'll automatically do his part you're a

[21:00] love you romans nine and um let's just
[21:08] read um they started verse nine Romans
[21:13] nine and nine and then we're gonna go to
[21:17] first Peter one Romans nine and nine the
[21:22] Bible says for this is the word of
[21:24] promise at this time will I come and
[21:27] Sarah shall have a son and not only this
[21:32] but when Rebecca also had conceived by
[21:35] one when even by our Father Isaac for
[21:40] the children being not yet born neither
[21:43] have done any good or evil that the
[21:47] purpose of God according to election
[21:49] might stand not of works but of him that
[21:54] calleth it was said unto her the elder
[21:58] shall serve the younger as it is written
[22:00] Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated
[22:03] a man first Peter one
[22:22] first Peter one familiar verses of
[22:27] Scripture to make a short let's stop
[22:30] reading at verse sinks
[22:34] first Peter one and six the Bible says
[22:37] wherein you greatly rejoice who not
[22:41] though now for a season if need be ye
[22:44] are in heaven is through metaphor
[22:46] temptation that the trial of your faith
[22:50] being much more precious than gold that
[22:54] perishes though it be tried with fire
[22:58] might be found unto praise and honor and
[23:01] glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ
[23:05] they made me the Lord of the Blessed
[23:07] reading of his word you can have your
[23:08] seats and as you sit I want to turn over
[23:11] to Psalms 37 I want to read these verses
[23:18] of scriptures because I don't know if
[23:20] I'm gonna be able to get back to him
[23:21] again Psalms 37
[23:39] at verse 39 the Bible says but the
[23:46] salvation of the righteous is of the
[23:49] Lord he is their strength in the time of
[23:54] trouble Amen praise the Lord you know we
[23:59] have so many precious promises that God
[24:02] has given us and I and I want you to
[24:06] understand that every promise that God
[24:09] has given is already ours amen then all
[24:14] we have to do is take God at His Word he
[24:17] meant you know because God will back up
[24:20] whatever he said and tonight I want to
[24:24] say it like this
[24:25] then I have something very tasty tonight
[24:28] hallelujah I have something very good
[24:31] for the believer tonight amen because
[24:33] when God starts dealing with me about it
[24:35] I just start smiling hallelujah you know
[24:38] ideas when God reveals something to you
[24:41] it just makes you feel good hallelujah
[24:44] sometimes you you can't explain it you
[24:46] just riding down in the car and you
[24:48] begin to think about what God is it's
[24:50] expressing to you and it's work and you
[24:53] just start smiling and the person in the
[24:56] next car they may be all mad going to
[24:59] work and they look over at you and they
[25:00] see somebody doing this because you're
[25:04] thinking about what God has revealed to
[25:06] you hallelujah and let me say it like
[25:09] this whatever God has revealed to you if
[25:11] his in his word it's a promise who a car
[25:16] accident can take it away a hurricane
[25:19] came take it away a blizzard came taking
[25:21] away my ice storm can't take it away if
[25:24] God promised it and he revealed it to
[25:27] you he's yours
[25:29] oh yeah and that's what we need to do is
[25:33] take God at His Word and you know
[25:35] tonight my subject is a man subject
[25:37] inspiration what if you want to call it
[25:39] take it out of you main but my sucker
[25:41] tonight is trouble huh Leah brings
[25:44] purpose amen and you know that we are
[25:47] people that don't like trouble
[25:50] we don't like to be tried we don't like
[25:53] to be tested but let me tell you
[25:55] something that's God's Way God loves to
[25:58] put us to a test
[25:59] God loves to bring trouble that way
[26:02] because the troubles in your life makes
[26:05] God come on the scene hallelujah and
[26:07] without no trouble God wouldn't be able
[26:10] to express himself hallelujah come on
[26:13] church
[26:14] I tell you I got something tasty for you
[26:16] tonight because if you going through
[26:18] something there's a purpose behind so we
[26:22] need to acknowledge this one thing
[26:24] everything every trouble that we go
[26:26] through every child we go through every
[26:29] situation every tribulation is always
[26:31] not the devil
[26:34] booyah we don't snatch it back from him
[26:37] tonight now I think some of you notice
[26:40] hallelujah
[26:41] I may have said this before but you know
[26:42] I had cancer in my brain whoo yeah and a
[26:47] very tender age and cancer in my brain
[26:50] but you know what the devil gets no
[26:52] credit because there was a purpose for
[26:58] that trouble coming in my life for the
[27:00] brand hallelujah amen it was a total
[27:03] devil to see how strong he was what
[27:05] cancer could do now there was one thing
[27:08] one purpose only hallelujah because when
[27:11] cancer came cancer was the only thing
[27:14] that could awaken the purpose of God
[27:18] [Applause]
[27:20] God's had to see glory God had to sin
[27:25] some trouble in my life why because
[27:28] there was a hidden purpose T oh yeah so
[27:32] I was all I wanted to be a football
[27:34] player hallelujah all I wanted to be a
[27:36] the next Herschel Walker whatever you
[27:39] want to call it holy
[27:41] you know a lot of us had dreams and we
[27:44] had aspirations and different things we
[27:46] wanted to do and God began to see his
[27:48] trouble in your life you know why
[27:52] because you were on the wrong path so
[27:55] God had to shake up your path he had to
[27:58] shake up your journey he had to send
[28:00] some trouble why because he had a
[28:02] purpose and I want you to understand
[28:07] hallelujah that there's something down
[28:10] and you that nobody else can see but God
[28:13] and it may look like this person is that
[28:19] person may have seen but no maybe God is
[28:22] doing something job look like hallelujah
[28:25] he had done something wrong to his
[28:27] friends but no God was up to something
[28:29] God sent that trouble hellooo and what I
[28:32] love about hallelujah God told the devil
[28:35] where to go no keep this up I might have
[28:41] a praise dance up in here
[28:44] [Applause]
[28:46] hallelujah but she knows attended it in
[28:51] church denomination way of thinking we
[28:55] think that when we go through something
[28:57] or people think that when you go through
[28:58] something this it's like oh why me he
[29:01] and hey why am I going through this and
[29:02] you know what I opposed to be your son
[29:04] because you are his son his daughter he
[29:06] sees the trouble because there's
[29:10] something called a promise call for me
[29:13] you something called adoption and you
[29:18] never get there unless you're proven
[29:21] you'll never get there unless you're
[29:23] tested
[29:24] you'll never get there unless God who
[29:26] you shows the enemy that you are a son
[29:30] you are a dog hallelujah so you know me
[29:36] in the hospital going through all that
[29:38] I'm going through and and I'm thinking
[29:40] you know at that time I wanted to play
[29:42] football and what's going on but God
[29:44] knew that there was something down
[29:46] inside that had to be awakened
[29:50] and cancer was the only thing that could
[29:54] trouble it wow that's some things in
[30:01] Darwin in his church tonight and God has
[30:04] sick some trouble to awaken was there ho
[30:10] and you know by that falling upon me and
[30:14] isn't it put my family under the stress
[30:16] and put my momma under the stress but
[30:18] there was something that was about to
[30:20] happen I see I want you to understand
[30:23] this church that when trouble comes if
[30:25] you are a saint of God with trouble
[30:32] comes if you are a saint of God what
[30:36] that trouble does that trouble is a
[30:39] challenge to the supernatural not only
[30:44] don't believe they don't believe the
[30:46] trouble are you gonna believe the
[30:48] supernatural God because the only thing
[30:55] cancer did cancer awakened a revelation
[31:00] that was down inside of me called
[31:02] Jehovah Rapha and without that cancer
[31:09] I'd never know he was a healer
[31:13] now what are you going through and what
[31:16] is God trying to awaken in your life
[31:18] hallelujah
[31:19] you know sometimes chaos is the will of
[31:22] God hooya sometimes when they look like
[31:28] things are completely out of oil in your
[31:30] life it's God doing something yeah and
[31:37] some of you looking like look let me
[31:39] like huh
[31:41] well let me ask you something
[31:43] who would you rather get that credit to
[31:46] God or the devil because if you give
[31:51] that to the devil what you're saying is
[31:53] that the devil has his hand on me huh
[31:58] and the prophet of God said if you have
[32:01] the Holy Ghost Satan can't make you do
[32:04] anything you have to surrender your will
[32:09] to him oh yeah then the prophet of god
[32:11] said if satan could make you do anything
[32:14] with you having the Holy Ghost he says
[32:16] he has to be your brother that me he's
[32:25] had to get back there where God at and
[32:28] say now I want you to do this but that's
[32:30] not according to the scripture according
[32:32] to the scripture hallelujah he says hey
[32:35] devil what you doing he say I'm going to
[32:37] and fro he says hey have you could still
[32:42] look at God sending the trouble he says
[32:44] hey have you considered my servant job
[32:47] and the devil says of course I have but
[32:51] you got a heads around him I can't get
[32:53] tall don't you know trouble can't get to
[33:01] you unless God allows it
[33:02] [Applause]
[33:07] cows can't come to your doorstep unless
[33:10] God allows it Tom okay come to your
[33:16] children trouble can't come to your wife
[33:19] trouble can't come to your husband Tommy
[33:21] can't come to your church your job your
[33:23] family whatever years unless God allows
[33:26] it you know we do we stupid Satan's
[33:36] power we're stripping him tonight
[33:41] because he's not as powerful as we made
[33:44] him to be only power he has is
[33:49] perversion and you know perversion is
[33:53] perversion is taking was already
[33:55] established and twisting it and just in
[33:59] case you didn't realize Satan doesn't
[34:02] even have his own vocabulary he has to
[34:04] take what God has already spoken he has
[34:11] to take what God has already spoken and
[34:14] twist it that's why he came to even say
[34:17] has God said because there's only one
[34:25] author of the word
[34:29] whoo yeah in the beginning was the word
[34:32] the Word was with God the Word was God
[34:34] and the word became fish Satan doesn't
[34:41] even have his own vocabulary he's a
[34:44] pervert and he comes and he says has God
[34:48] said if thou be in all these things all
[34:52] he's doing is taking what God has
[34:54] already presented he's trying to make
[34:56] trouble out of it but let's catch this
[34:59] one thing I want you to realize before
[35:03] you go from anything before you go
[35:06] through any test let's look at how God
[35:09] thinks about it let's look at job for a
[35:14] second before job went through that test
[35:17] oh yeah before he went through that
[35:19] trial Satan said yeah I wanted them I
[35:23] wasn't get to him but I can't you got
[35:25] heads around and then he says hey let me
[35:29] get a hold of them that this is what the
[35:31] trouble is all about he says let me get
[35:34] a hold of him and I guarantee you he'll
[35:36] crush you to your face now I wonder what
[35:39] you doing when you going through your
[35:40] trouble you could be failing the test by
[35:45] the way you act when you're going
[35:47] through your troubles now no we all act
[35:54] different hallelujah but you know
[35:56] hallelujah when I'm on the airplane I
[35:58] like to try to take that I like to try
[36:01] to take the the behavior or the make up
[36:05] of the pilot because they know what they
[36:10] bite the fly into think hear the radio
[36:12] they can hear from the on the tower all
[36:15] these different things about how far is
[36:17] gonna be out so when they get to the
[36:19] trouble they take up some time they out
[36:24] there playing English Connect for talk
[36:29] to
[36:32] being worried about the trouble because
[36:35] they have a destination and they believe
[36:38] they're gonna get there huh but you know
[36:40] for us some of us who are back there
[36:43] behind the seat those of us who are
[36:48] behind the seat when we get in that
[36:50] plane it I've even heard people call
[36:54] that Jesus in those times people that
[37:00] don't go to church people that anything
[37:02] about the Lord just a little bit of
[37:03] trouble there but those violence you
[37:10] know those pilots are doing they're just
[37:12] coasting on through they don't even put
[37:15] their hands on the control they keep it
[37:17] in autopilot and you know what our
[37:22] problem is some of us want to put our
[37:25] hands on the steering wheel but tonight
[37:29] I want everybody to put it back in Jesus
[37:32] hands let's put everything back on
[37:35] autopilot huh
[37:37] let's put everything back old dust head
[37:39] the Lord
[37:41] hooyah let's stop trying to do it
[37:44] ourselves and just say god I'm depending
[37:47] on you because faith is a very powerful
[37:53] element and you will never come through
[37:57] a storm if you don't have any faith
[37:59] oh yeah and you know Hurley the pilot
[38:03] may be flying the plane
[38:05] but once that door closes me and him got
[38:08] the same face y'all realize that once
[38:14] that doors close and everybody get up in
[38:16] there you got equal faith cuz the door
[38:21] is closed what's measuring the faith
[38:25] everybody's in the same vehicle
[38:28] everybody's going to the same place
[38:30] everybody's at the same altitude haruya
[38:35] so the pilot can come to me and say I
[38:37] got more faith in you I say prove it
[38:41] what makes it right greater than mine is
[38:44] it the stripes on his shirt no dang
[38:46] don't do it see according to the vehicle
[38:50] with the same now let me drop something
[38:56] on you Church hallelujah
[38:57] you know God sent us a prophet and God
[39:04] gave him a vehicle to preach call the
[39:06] Word of God oh yeah and you know there
[39:09] was a woman in Memphis Tennessee who
[39:12] said I'm just like that suit of mine now
[39:14] where is my Elisha she found her place
[39:18] in the scripture hallelujah where she
[39:21] could see one part of the word and she
[39:24] said if I'm this part of the world where
[39:26] is the rest of Who I am the Prophet said
[39:33] is the word seeing the word booyah
[39:36] she turns when you find yourself in
[39:38] troubles you need to find yourself in
[39:40] the scripture and what made that story
[39:46] so special was because the prophet of
[39:48] God said haruya that the shooter might
[39:51] and the Prophet Elisha were of the same
[39:55] caliber we were all the same caliber so
[40:02] let me let me say it t like this church
[40:04] the Bible says that the word came to a
[40:07] prophet haruya the word always comes to
[40:10] the Prophet is that not God's Way now
[40:14] hallelujah
[40:15] that's the said the law amen now the
[40:18] question is who does the Prophet come to
[40:25] [Applause]
[40:27] if Jesus comes to that prophet holy
[40:31] jesus is in that prophet earlier and
[40:33] then that Jesus in that prophet comes to
[40:36] people who's coming to you he's just a
[40:41] man we call William Branham but no is
[40:43] God manifested in the flesh holier and
[40:47] it's time for us to take our eyes off of
[40:50] man and realize that it was God doing
[40:52] something honey and you know church with
[41:03] a message like this I can just bet Harry
[41:06] I can really feel God breaking every
[41:09] chain and you know when you think about
[41:14] your troubles if you're a person that's
[41:15] bitter if there's something about your
[41:26] life that's not under the blood we're
[41:30] gonna talk about it tonight we go sniff
[41:35] it out tonight because a lot of times
[41:38] Dean was like to come to church in hide
[41:42] they want to sit in their troubles and
[41:45] be all miserable they want to come to
[41:48] tighten and start the growth of the
[41:51] atmosphere anything the ones that bother
[41:54] me doing the worship service the songs
[41:56] are up there honors this big old movie
[41:59] stream and you sit there like this
[42:03] [Music]
[42:11] we sing it we going up yonder there's
[42:23] something in your spirit that's not
[42:27] connecting with the revelation the
[42:29] inspiration of that song you're letting
[42:33] your troubles get the best of you when
[42:35] your troubles is supposed to bring you
[42:37] closer to God there's not a place in the
[42:42] scripture where the Saints were ever in
[42:45] trouble that it didn't bring God closer
[42:48] [Applause]
[42:58] you found me a place where trouble came
[43:00] in the believers life and they got for
[43:02] sucking my god every bit of trouble that
[43:07] ever came brought god I'm seeing huh and
[43:13] God loves to put us in the midst of
[43:15] chaos because it's scriptural the Bible
[43:20] says in Genesis 1 it says that the earth
[43:22] holier and God created the heavens and
[43:25] the earth and it was without form and it
[43:29] was void and darkness was upon the face
[43:32] of the deep total chaos but what did
[43:40] that chaos do all of that darkness all
[43:43] that chaos he calls God to respond
[43:48] well all that voice I'm gonna make up a
[43:52] word voidness got into school teachers
[43:57] in here forgive me of course you can see
[44:00] that I'm I'm not politically correct I'm
[44:05] a different message preacher because I
[44:09] believe that the message is gone from
[44:12] just books and tapes I believe that the
[44:16] message now are a people the message is
[44:22] walking upright
[44:24] you know you laying on the table no more
[44:26] they laying on the shelf
[44:28] oh you don't need to see you play but
[44:31] the message got shoes on now the message
[44:35] got tires round the neck message got
[44:38] skirts on now this whole Poli the
[44:41] message got curls hallelujah cuz that
[44:49] what the Bible says is no longer written
[44:52] in the tables of stone but now it's
[44:53] written on the fleshly hearts of the
[44:56] believer you are the message hallelujah
[45:01] [Applause]
[45:02] yeah you know what yeah yeah I know you
[45:05] know it's been doors closed because I
[45:08] believed it but that don't bother me oh
[45:13] yeah we don't take anything away from a
[45:16] prophet when you believe the message
[45:18] came for you
[45:21] [Applause]
[45:22] again the word came to the Providence in
[45:25] the profit came to who me I don't know
[45:30] about you but it came to me and what did
[45:33] it come to do it came to separate me
[45:36] from my troubles so your troubles
[45:41] doesn't define you who you what defines
[45:44] you is how you go through the storm so
[45:50] how the bible says a righteous man falls
[45:51] seven times when he gets back up again
[45:53] see there's not enough trouble in his
[45:55] life to keep him down but there's
[45:58] something inside it says I shall rise I
[46:01] shall rise I shall rise
[46:05] I shall rise why because He is risen
[46:10] [Applause]
[46:12] [Music]
[46:16] hello some of y'all think he just too
[46:19] radical will leave me alone I like me in
[46:25] this way let me explain something to you
[46:29] I wasn't born and bred in a Pentecostal
[46:32] church when morning Barry the Baptist
[46:36] Methodist what you see is a direct
[46:41] product of the message of the
[46:48] some of you guys know the Word of God
[46:54] the message of the hour this is why I
[46:56] laugh and all these people who've left
[46:57] and now they say
[47:05] we're so free we're experiencing God's
[47:08] love we free what makes them free
[47:12] hallelujah
[47:14] what makes them free in their own eyes
[47:16] is simple they don't have to be
[47:18] hypocrite anymore you have to act like
[47:25] they believe something they didn't
[47:27] believe so now what they're saying I'm
[47:30] free to be a hog I'm free to be a pig
[47:35] I'm free to be a Jezebel the reason why
[47:45] they don't want this message is simple
[47:48] because it separates you from the
[47:50] falseness it won't allow you to live in
[47:55] the world and live for God there's a
[47:59] dividing line hallelujah so if you got a
[48:02] problem in your flesh hallelujah this
[48:05] message deals with it
[48:07] [Applause]
[48:11] hallelujah huh but when we look at the
[48:19] trouble that God bring chaos total chaos
[48:21] the Bible says it was without forming
[48:24] without boys
[48:24] he says he was darkness that's over the
[48:26] face of deep and so forth but then what
[48:29] did all that darkness and chaos and
[48:30] voidness do it calls God to speak
[48:36] I got a church in here tonight do I got
[48:42] a church in here cuz I got somebody in
[48:46] here who know what it means when God
[48:48] speaks hello to know that everything
[48:52] changes when God speaks no matter how
[48:56] dark no matter how messy no matter how
[49:00] stale when God speaks everything changes
[49:04] [Applause]
[49:07] and observed most of you are used to
[49:11] coming to church on a Saturday night
[49:15] amen brother Diggs
[49:16] we love Saturday and you come here
[49:22] because you're used to that's the wrong
[49:27] attitude see what I want you to
[49:31] understand y'all notice I brother Louie
[49:33] cut it off because God's presence is
[49:36] here God's presence is here and I want
[49:41] you to realize tonight honey
[49:44] if you come with the right attitude what
[49:47] you've been praying about can be a
[49:48] reality
[49:51] tonight that healing can be a reality

[50:09] our trouble holy his blindness thought
[50:12] God on the scene but in a supernatural
[50:15] way against all doubt hallelujah and it
[50:18] may have talked earlier several days
[50:20] hallelujah but God let the trouble go he
[50:23] let the trouble go knowing that there
[50:25] was a purpose in church what I want you
[50:28] to realize that this miracle was not
[50:30] only for the church people but the
[50:32] witnesses was in a barber shop
[50:35] [Applause]
[50:38] could it be what you going through
[50:40] hallelujah we'll help some silligan same
[50:43] ooh yeah you know your family members
[50:50] your unsaved loved ones
[50:52] they're watching you how you go through
[50:53] this trouble and Satan oh yeah he stands
[51:00] back he's thinking things I got the
[51:03] price I got nothing God sitting this God
[51:06] said they listened to him and then God
[51:07] reminds him he says because I let you
[51:13] and then Satan wants to use that he says
[51:15] okay okay you ain't got to show off okay
[51:18] okay I'll understand god I'm backing up
[51:20] I'm backing up I know you got all this
[51:23] under control but just let me have my
[51:25] moley
[51:26] and then God is sitting over here he's
[51:28] the same talking so what moment
[51:30] you ain't got no moment what you doing
[51:32] is what I'm telling you to do don't
[51:39] charge we ought to realize that whatever
[51:42] the devil is doing God has allowed it
[51:49] cuz there's the purpose holy
[51:52] the Bible says before a Jacob and Esau
[51:56] even born God loved one and he hated one
[51:59] why because of the purpose one had to be
[52:03] a size two huh Leah amen
[52:06] one had had to not have recompense for
[52:08] the reward but all of that was God's
[52:10] purpose why because in take earlier
[52:13] there was a nation so that was a certain
[52:19] way his life had to go he had to
[52:21] experience trouble why because it was a
[52:25] nation in size earlier and you know that
[52:28] that trouble hallelujah all the things
[52:30] he was experiencing was gonna name those
[52:32] boys you are a Reuben you are is it ha
[52:38] you are Joseph you are Benjamin holder
[52:41] there wasn't just names but those names
[52:44] but their adoption and God let all those
[52:54] things happen he let him and he he let
[52:57] Jacob uh uh run into trouble with his
[52:59] brother brother come everybody all right
[53:06] time is never on my side
[53:09] that's why I'm glad I'm not a creature
[53:11] of time I hope there's more people in
[53:19] here like me tonight because if you
[53:27] haven't realized we're in that span
[53:29] where it says and time shall be no more
[53:32] when he begins to sound he sounded so we
[53:39] should be living in another place when
[53:41] we come to church how many of us how
[53:44] many of us come to church and we and we
[53:46] drive a stake down and we say God ain't

[57:30] hallelujah hey so you can see me go
[57:34] through something that you can't explain
[57:35] look like it's off the scripture but
[57:38] it's God's will no I'm not advocating
[57:44] sin what I'm saying is what most of us
[57:48] need to learn how to do more often is
[57:49] shut up keep our thoughts to ourself if
[57:57] you ain't got nothing good to say don't
[57:59] say nothing at all but we're in a day
[58:03] where God didn't come to take away too
[58:05] long
[58:05] he came to magnify the law so instead of
[58:08] saying if you ain't got nothing good to
[58:09] say don't say nothing at all we're gonna
[58:11] magnify brother hair if you think I've
[58:13] nothing good to think don't think
[58:15] nothing at all walk around like a zombie
[58:21] [Applause]
[58:24] viewing and then good to think about we
[58:29] see people going through stuff and in
[58:30] media we start thinking negative oh oh
[58:35] she doesn't
[58:36] oh he doesn't oh the brothers just and
[58:38] the brother that you never thought about
[58:40] maybe God is in control Church so that
[58:46] the purpose of God could be fulfilled
[58:48] God let a little young girl go into
[58:51] prostitution
[58:55] her name was Rahab oh yeah
[58:59] God never going to prostitution why oh
[59:02] yeah because she had to meet a general
[59:05] in the army and from that zero they had
[59:08] to have a boy ass and from that boy they
[59:11] had to have a Jesse from that Jesse a
[59:13] Damon from baby Jesus
[59:15] [Applause]
[59:19] so God let her go through the trouble so
[59:22] she could be a blessing to us and you
[59:27] look at all the critics just seeing that
[59:29] below processing know she was one in the
[59:34] lineage of Jesus Christ and everybody
[59:37] else looking at her trouble but our

[1:05:13] of those social media things that I know
[1:05:15] that and then I went on then I put in
[1:05:18] something that's it and it goes like
[1:05:19] this put God first and he will bless you
[1:05:26] put God second and he will show you that
[1:05:29] he should have been first
[1:05:33] [Applause]
[1:05:37] I don't know about you but it's always
[1:05:39] worked in my life
[1:05:41] anytime I've ever put God second he
[1:05:44] showed me boy

[1:12:53] obey that voice and who's gonna tell a
[1:12:58] person like me huh
[1:12:59] that's telling like they're all alone
[1:13:01] that God will take care and you know
[1:13:08] it's a process and the reason why you
[1:13:11] know and I go through it over and over
[1:13:13] and over and over you know Stan Eagle
[1:13:15] I'm speaking to your standing knee but
[1:13:17] you know what God is doing Church for
[1:13:18] those of you who get sick and you get
[1:13:20] sick and you get sick and you get sick
[1:13:21] and you get healed and you can heal then
[1:13:23] you get healing in heal you know why
[1:13:25] because God is perfecting that
[1:13:28] revelation a lot of the Bible says
[1:13:33] earlier its business is he's a cannon oh
[1:13:36] joy we follow the dollars of things he
[1:13:38] said count your child more precious than
[1:13:41] gold tried in the fire go deity fire God
[1:13:48] so everything about this trial is God
[1:13:54] and what God does he lets us go through
[1:13:57] it brings us out go through it brings us
[1:14:00] out go through it brings us out what is
[1:14:02] he doing he's perfecting it and you know
[1:14:05] what I do know what I believe he's doing
[1:14:06] for me it's gonna get to a place where I
[1:14:08] ain't even gonna be thinking about my
[1:14:10] final I'll be like that's all you got
[1:14:13] God will provide he don't make me
[1:14:18] nervous
[1:14:19] it'll be know what I'm doing what I'm
[1:14:21] gonna do no he didn't done it so much
[1:14:23] tonight he's perfect it's like a person
[1:14:27] gets a revelation of healing see I'm
[1:14:29] there when it comes to healing
[1:14:30] ain't they own finances yet so there
[1:14:35] might be some areas you perfected and I
[1:14:37] ain't perfected yeah and there may be
[1:14:39] some areas that I perfected that you in
[1:14:40] perfecting yet but by God's grace we all
[1:14:43] gonna get there but when it comes to
[1:14:48] healing holy that's not a challenge for
[1:14:50] me they told me I coughs I said no I
[1:14:55] don't they told me I had diabetes I said
[1:15:04] no I don't got beans revelation and one
[1:15:12] day the devil had the audacity to try to
[1:15:14] sneak attack me - Nick attacked me when
[1:15:18] I least expected I'm going to renew my
[1:15:20] license and people say well you got to
[1:15:23] take a fields gonna keep your CDL in and
[1:15:25] take those things I'm gonna take the
[1:15:27] physical and people say you got high
[1:15:28] blood pressure doesn't walk just in case
[1:15:33] you let that means me
[1:15:37] that's like me high blood pressure so
[1:15:40] yeah you got a blonde say no I don't say
[1:15:42] yes you do I said no I don't and you
[1:15:45] know Satan looks they have a streaming
[1:15:46] match but I can get louder than he came
[1:15:49] when it comes to healing he says yes you
[1:15:56] do I said in the name of Jesus no I
[1:16:00] don't say yes you do how they buy
[1:16:03] stripes I'm healed no I don't and say
[1:16:10] yes to do ya say he's the LORD thy God
[1:16:12] that healeth thee from all thy diseases
[1:16:16] so the most Satan come the louder I get
[1:16:19] because I got no revelation so you know
[1:16:27] what doctor comes in Isis and
[1:16:29] reinforcements he comes in with his book
[1:16:30] and all the stuff he says well mr. deeds

[1:16:41] says well this is what we can do I can
[1:16:45] give you a one-year card and you come
[1:16:48] back because you got high blood pressure
[1:16:51] or you can retake the test see Satan
[1:16:54] always want you to settle for less than
[1:16:58] what I was supposed to get was two years
[1:17:01] and you know what I told my saying we
[1:17:02] gonna take the test over I ain't afraid
[1:17:06] to put my guard on see
[1:17:09] I ain't afraid to say that this trouble
[1:17:11] has come to bring in the supernatural Oh
[1:17:15] God don't make believers out of the
[1:17:17] nurse out of the doctor out of the Clark

[1:17:38] pressure you don't scare me with your
[1:17:42] tricks and your antics devil I got a

[1:18:07] and she says you're right you don't have
[1:18:10] high blood I say I've told you that from
[1:18:12] the get-go let's say like this church
[1:18:19] maybe all God wants you to do tonight is
[1:18:22] speaking maybe all the trouble is about
[1:18:35] putting you in position
[1:18:37] for the purpose of God to be fulfilled
[1:18:39] out of your life huh remember there was
[1:18:43] a prophet who will endure Wars one day
[1:18:45] and he was in trouble he's looking for
[1:18:49] hunting game and all these things he
[1:18:51] couldn't find it why was it so dry why
[1:18:54] was it so much chaos in trouble because
[1:18:58] God had put him in position to speak and
[1:19:02] then it was another day when he he was -
[1:19:04] on business he was gonna pray for
[1:19:06] somebody and all of a sudden a bull
[1:19:08] arose up trouble God put his prophet in
[1:19:13] the midst of that trouble why so he
[1:19:15] could see that he was a son God
[1:19:20] all right whoa I feel the Holy Ghost
[1:19:23] moving in here now oh yeah God put him
[1:19:27] in the midst of that hallelujah he
[1:19:29] didn't know the boy was gonna be there
[1:19:31] he left his gun in the car huh it was so
[1:19:33] much trouble the fist was too far away
[1:19:38] he couldn't run that so he's third day
[1:19:40] he said well I guess I'm a dying on that
[1:19:44] like a coward and just speaking that
[1:19:47] alone the presence of God came in the
[1:19:50] midst of his trouble the supernatural Oh
[1:19:54] shitty and you know right there I
[1:20:01] guarantee if he was he just say I didn't
[1:20:04] feel like I was in trouble you know why
[1:20:09] cuz God put him there see the pressure
[1:20:15] you're feeling you're not supposed to
[1:20:17] feel when you let God take over remember
[1:20:24] that was a blizzard the prism everybody
[1:20:28] else didn't read all other brothers run
[1:20:30] and guard to him stop go back God that a
[1:20:35] blizzard come so a prophet could control
[1:20:38] creation

[1:21:40] havoc all over the place
[1:21:42] persecuting the church doing all the
[1:21:44] stuff you know what was going on God was
[1:21:48] pushing the word into other places so
[1:21:52] God had to send a man that was gonna
[1:21:53] persecute them so they wouldn't all stay
[1:21:55] in the same place but then he wasn't
[1:21:59] done huh yeah cuz he took that man
[1:22:02] hugger who was calling so much trouble
[1:22:04] put him in trouble knock him off his
[1:22:09] horse huh made him blind honey what was
[1:22:12] the purpose of the blindness now he has
[1:22:14] to look through the eyes of God I just
[1:22:23] love God's God has a sense of you you
[1:22:27] know and then you know the church people
[1:22:28] they don't believe God can save anybody

[1:22:39] amen and don't plan on being unsaved
[1:22:44] no matter what trouble I go through I
[1:22:47] believe he's a keeper
[1:22:49] oh yeah and now that I'm looking through
[1:22:53] a different lens I have to look at my
[1:22:55] troubles my trials my situations as a
[1:22:58] blessing oh my one I challenge you
[1:23:09] tonight how many of us are sitting in
[1:23:11] here saying lord I thank you for my
[1:23:13] troubles and hard doing it scripture job
[1:23:25] how long will you continue to hold on to
[1:23:27] your integrity he says the Lord God
[1:23:29] giveth and the Lord God taketh away
[1:23:31] blessed be the name of the law Joe I'm
[1:23:38] just so sick Hollis you're going through
[1:23:40] and you just st. pay me no attention you
[1:23:43] bat me no jess is a nittany you just why
[1:23:46] don't you just curse God and die now
[1:23:51] that was his heart that was his partner
[1:23:54] and I see got trouble on her she calls
[1:23:58] him Oh pressure
[1:23:59] Joseph woman you speak it as the foolish
[1:24:01] women you expect to receive all good and
[1:24:05] no evil at the hand of the Lord you mean
[1:24:13] God controls evil too so the devil's own
[1:24:20] even control evil
[1:24:24] God turns it loose don't let that be a
[1:24:31] stumbling block now there'd be no evil
[1:24:38] if there was no God because evil shows
[1:24:48] his goodness if there was no sickness
[1:24:53] there be no healing if there was nobody
[1:24:56] lost there be no Savior if there was
[1:24:59] nobody bound there'd be no deliverer
[1:25:01] hallelujah so if there was no trouble
[1:25:04] there'd be no need for a mighty God so
[1:25:07] the prophet of God said holy all these
[1:25:10] things called out his attributes
[1:25:13] [Applause]
[1:25:14] now what attribute is he tried to

[1:34:18] observation it brings troubles it brings
[1:34:23] stirrups and we can't expect to be

[1:38:21] out the boat hugly I can see him hardly
[1:38:23] he probably was even thinking about the
[1:38:25] water one thing about net all he did was
[1:38:26] kept his eyes on Jesus he joked that
[1:38:29] during that water the water solid he
[1:38:32] started walking towards Jesus he didn't
[1:38:35] see any more trouble anymore all he did
[1:38:37] was saw Jesus and as long as he kept his
[1:38:39] eyes on Jesus
[1:38:40] everything was peace but as soon as he
[1:38:43] started looking at his trouble he's
[1:38:46] starting to sink he started to fall and
[1:38:48] he's darling Rita save me don't you
[1:38:52] realize he was i dead all alone and god

[1:39:00] you keep your eyes on him the trouble
[1:39:02] have no effect on you amen
[1:39:10] either have no effect and you know
[1:39:13] sometimes god I put you in trouble
[1:39:15] because there's something inside he
[1:39:18] wants he let David commit premeditated
[1:39:24] murder adultery plus why he did all that
[1:39:30] why why he let David go through all that
[1:39:33] trouble so he can repent and he didn't
[1:39:37] get Psalm 51 out of
[1:39:42] create in me a clean
[1:39:45] [Music]
[1:39:46] Oh God and renew a right spirit within
[1:39:53] me that song would've never came with

[1:40:03] sing that song today cast me not away
[1:40:09] from that present Sokka
[1:40:12] take not thy Holy Spirit from me all
[1:40:19] that come from David's trouble cigar let
[1:40:25] David go through all that why cuz he had
[1:40:27] the Book of Psalms in the Lord is my
[1:40:32] shepherd I shall not want
[1:40:39] that's God's Way he allowed things to
[1:40:41] come
[1:40:42] so things and you can come out and don't
[1:40:48] you realize he allowed Paul to persecute
[1:40:50] the church why cuz he said he's a chosen
[1:40:53] fell so he let him go through all that
[1:40:56] trouble
[1:40:57] he was night and day in the sea I think
[1:41:00] he's I think you say he's whipped over
[1:41:01] five times he was thrown over the wall
[1:41:03] all these things bit by fire hey man all
[1:41:06] that stuff was going on why because
[1:41:08] there was a purpose you know what it was
[1:41:11] hallelujah
[1:41:12] the purpose was in power there was a
[1:41:14] book of Romans
[1:41:15] there was a book of Corinthians there
[1:41:17] was an emphasis there was a Galatians oh
[1:41:19] it was a Hebrews oh that was wrapped up
[1:41:26] in Paul so Paul had to go through some
[1:41:28] trouble so God can get it out there was
[1:41:33] a purpose church don't you realize half
[1:41:36] of the New Testament was written why
[1:41:38] powers in jail

[1:42:21] doesn't know how did I get I don't know
[1:42:23] don't do nothing don't do nothing don't
[1:42:26] try to look at the outcome and when it's

[1:43:21] called Abraham when he was an old man
[1:43:23] why so he could show him the power of
[1:43:26] redemption so he could show him that the
[1:43:30] sickness and the deadness of his body
[1:43:32] couldn't stop the purpose of God and
[1:43:36] Sarah looking at the trouble she said oh

[1:44:10] midst of your storm there's a purpose
[1:44:14] the devil gets no credit it is no cream

[1:44:30] cuz he loves to be worshipped
[1:44:32] Perley your brother God saying after the
[1:44:35] word is delivered that's the time to
[1:44:36] worship and you know sometimes in our
