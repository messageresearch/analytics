[Applause] aren't you glad you can say that you know it's amazing there's a lot of folks that sing Amazing Grace but you can tell by their life it hadn't amazed them too much because they're still hanging on to the world things of the world if it amazes us enough it'll change us amen didn't have brother Andrew preach up a storm here oh my goodness we're so blessed amen so blessed and I heard some really good comments about the camp over in South Carolina's or done some really good things the devil must have got really mad because much of them got sick so best signs when the devil goes to fight and what God's doing in it I got some really nice text from some of the preachers over there actually the administrators that was running hitting all uh been so complementary of our youth group just really really nice things and I just wanted to give them flower tonight I said they didn't have one issue not one problem except for the John hornyak so they'll have to deal with him of course they were only teasing amen if our Christianity does not go with us everywhere we go what good is it doesn't have a representation of Christ no matter where we are I preached many of those camps through the years and I can tell you from dealing with the preachers that run it Sometimes some of the young people who come there are nothing but headaches nothing but troubles one issue after another so it makes me proud of those that go and they're going to get something from the Lord to be a blessing and to be a help amen God bless you let's turn to that if we went to Revelation chapter 18 verse 1. Revelation chapter 18 verse 1. now remember in reading this tonight that some people try to follow the Book of Revelation and numeric order I know a great preacher in the message that for years and years preached and said that Revelation 10 actually didn't apply to brother Branham or the seven seal didn't apply to us because he was trying to preach chapter 1 chapter 2 chapter 3 chapter 4 then after chapter four The bribe is gone so chapter five six seven eight nine on down through the rest of the chapters didn't even pertain to the bride at all but of course it was a lack of Revelation from the brother but we know that the Book of Revelation is not written like that it's written to where it takes a prophet to be able to take it and unfold it to us and what we're going to read tonight these first few verses even though it seems like it's plum over in in the tribulation period yet we know that part of this actually applies to us now the thing is that God called us out of was the system of the churches of the world and while it is yet in her there is Mercy for people to come out and the prophet said come out of her before it goes into him once it goes into him that's it so I'm glad you heard the voice amen after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven now remember which is chapter 16 17 and I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the Great The Babylon has mentioned previously in the Book of Revelation but not by these terms but this is Babylon the great you remember reading of course if you know history very well that there was a Herod and there was a Herod the Great not the same man at all so Babylon is Mystical but it's also spiritual and it's a natural place too but this is Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen and has become the habitation of devils wow what a terrible thing to have said about you and the hold of every foul spirit and the word hole there means prison or watch guard persons keeping the watch the place where captives were kept so whatever this Babylon the grade is it's become the habitation of devils and it's a cage that holds other things what are those things what are they well the prophet will tell us I'll read to you in a bit churches churches so the systems are held in this cage here a cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wraths the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are waxed rich through her the abundance of her Delicacies and I heard another voice from Heaven saying oh my goodness you mean some of God's people were in that mess I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that re you receive not of her plagues for her sins have reached unto heaven and God has remembered her iniquities which means they were not repented of because if you ever repent of him he'll never remember them again so whatever this was and whoever they were they were doing all of this stuff and not repenting or if they were repenting they were repenting contrary to the way of truce and God could not pardon them I don't want him to remember mine aren't you glad that he's forgotten yours let's pray together Heavenly Father we counted such a privilege to be gathered together tonight we love you so much Lord just just to be able to gather with one another is wonderful but together with one another in your courts we're so blessed Lord Jesus makes us so mindful to know that you're not limited to be able together with your people and just even a church building I've shared it with them before several years ago that as I stood in Kenya and I had a school rented but there was a mix-up and another group had it rented the same day so they would not let us have that room to be able to have church so the Saints made a makeshift small platform and they had hundreds and hundreds of chairs they all set out in the sun and they let me preach under the shade of a tree but it didn't hinder you at all you showed right up as a matter of fact I got a testimony from a young man not too many months ago that was at that meeting that had malaria the doctors had told him he'd have it the rest of his life but you showed up in such a way and healed that young boy that he was then that he's been back to the doctors time and time he's a curious creature they want to still keep testing him but there's not a trace left in his body because Jesus showed up under a tree I remember reading in the Bible there was another man that could testify about you showing up under a sycamore and you raised your eyes and said Zacchaeus make haste and come down yeah so we believe you'll gather you with us again tonight father we're so needy of you Lord please help us father speak to us from your word we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus and the Saints said amen amen God bless you you may be seated I believe we're certainly living in a great prophetic hour but there's parts of Prophecy I have no desire to fulfill there's parts of the scripture which are allocated to certain people such as Judas such as pharaoh such as vessels of Dishonor that I personally have no anointing that pushes me in that direction to be able to fulfill that portion of scripture there are people that are anointed to be deceivers there are people that are anointed to betray there are people that are anointed to set even around where the truth is preached and yet they will Journey along for a while and they'll stumble over something that is said and they'll begin to reason in their mind and then they will contemplate that they're not sure that this is actually the truth anymore and then they will turn and go the other way and become a very enemy to the thing that they once embraced but that's not my anointing I may say that's not your anointing either my anointing is to say Amen to the truth not only with my mouth but with my life and I'm glad that God has helped us to see that but yet we know nevertheless there are people who are called that will fulfill this side of Prophecy as well and we know that whenever God allocates his word that he must have those that are as we read it here the other day that are vessels which are for prepared to dishonor and on the other side of that there are vessels that are prepared to glory and we know that God is Not unjust and that he will not allow people if they want to be saved they can be but we also know that if you gave some people ten thousand years on this Earth at the end of that ten thousand years they would still say I hate God I don't want nothing to do with him I don't want to live for him and this is the way that God can be able to make his program work but because we have been called by God and and we have been lightened as the scripture says about this Mighty angel of Revelation 18 1. notice how John when he sees this in the vision and he said after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven now John by chapter 18 has been visited by many different angels and remember that God gives different Angels different charges of his anointing of what they are supposed to do some of them were actually Earthly men that were Anointed with an Angelic anointing others were truly angels and they appear like angels and they were not men they were Angels Angelic creations of God and there were others that were fallen angels in that they had been given the privilege to walk before God and them they made their choice to listen to Lucifer and they fell from their first estate so there's all types of categories of angels even in the angels that did not fall there are cherubims seraphims zoons there are Mighty angels and angels of lesser degree we know even when Daniel Prayed and there was the Monarch the great Angelic power that when Daniel Prayed and he withstood the angel of God unto God had to send a mighty angel angel in rank higher and rank than this Fallen Angel even though this fallen angel had given his power his ability over to the kingdom of Hell unless sir angel in rank which had not Fallen at the beginning could not withstand him so God had to send another Angel which outranked this demon and Daniel had prayed and prayed and prayed and he wondered what in the world was going on and the angel told him from the first day that you prayed your prayer Was Heard but God had to send an angel which outranked him and he finally Ward and battled and Ward and he broke loose and while this one broke loose there were other angels that were there still holding open the door that God would be able to answer Daniel's prayer I wonder sometimes when we pray and we call out on the name of the Lord and we wonder why that the Lord hasn't moved for us I wonder if there's not a great Angelic war going on in our day as well so once you're praying don't stop and don't give up just keep on asking because God is hearing your prayer and we see then when we come to the Book of Revelation that it will be the culmination of all of these Angelic Powers a lot of folks they look at the time of the tribulation period and they think that Satan is totally in charge and in one way that is true but in another way God also is going to be doing great Mighty things in the tribulation period as a matter of fact the two witnesses of Revelation 11 they will have great power to control nature so Satan himself is not the only conduit or the only Power that will call for storms and all these sort of things but Moses and Elijah will be able to control nature during the time of the tribulation period so not only is Satan crown on the Earth but God will be doing great things and by that I don don't mean that by great things it'll always be good and it'll always be kindness but it still will be great now probably a lot of us share tonight we've not yet learned how to give praise and honor and allelujahs to God when God will bring Vengeance and when God will do things that looks very destructive in nature it's not the nature of human beings to be able to really grasp that as an attribute of God's love all I know our insurance companies and your policy if you read it real close you'll find a cause in there somewhere called an act of God and they will identify the typhoons hurricanes tornadoes this and that and the other and they will call them acts of God but we know Satan is the prince of the power of the air but yet there is an attribute of God that will move in Justice in Revenge and in Vengeance for his people that's right now the strange thing about it is the real saints of God as we'll find out in Revelation 19 that actually there is a call from heaven for the saints of God to begin to say these beautiful phrases which is what we know as alleluia alleluia in other praise yah praise yah the heavens are called to do it the Saints are called to do it the universe is called to do it and the reason they're called to do it is because he has Avenged the blood of his people upon this church that we're going to talk about tonight now most human beings without a revelation they look at that and they think oh my goodness how on the world could a loving wonderful kind God do that so you see it takes Revelation and understanding to be able to do it now watch this the prophet picks this up and why I am against organized religion and if you haven't into a while to do you good it's preaching November the 11th and 19 and 62. now this angel of Light is said remember the last Angel it's the angel in the church age of laodicea it's the laodicea messenger and he says the very next chapter chapter 19 is the coming of the Bride then this last angel came to bring the light before the coming of the Bride to go meet Christ so here brother Madam identifies the messenger of Revelation 18 1 through 4 as the seventh Church AIDS messenger of Revelation 3 which is also the same messenger of Revelation 10 1 and Luke 17 28 to 30. also Malachi 4 5 6. also Zechariah 14. Prophecies of the Old Testament pointing to the coming of a prophet in the last day now unlike son some who will say they believe brother Branham as a prophet I think it takes more than just saying he was a prophet to be identified in the bride I believe that it requires more than just saying well I come out of her but I really don't feed on what he had to say well you're not really the bribe then because the bride is going to feed on the message of the hour now but yet we have preachers in our ranks and they say they believe malach come for and they say they believe that this message was sent from God but they really don't preach this message they just keep going back to the same old Bible stories that we preach for hundreds and hundreds of years and really don't pull it through the evening light of the end time well my friend you're not preaching or rapturing message in order to be in the Rapture it must be pulled through the anointing of the last day remember when the prophet preaches the seals and he sets up a box there even the question answers and he said now this is the anointing and he takes those four powers in Revelation each one identified through a church age and he said they could only work through that anointing that was released to them well Luther could only respond to the anointing God gave them in their day same with Paul same with irania same with all the rest of them and we will never be able to make it under the past anointings that had been released down Through the Ages they were wonderful in their day but we are the generation that needs enough Faith to take a body change oh my how we love the Epistles of Paul do we not how we love Peter and James and how we love the New Testament but think of it friends those Epistles did not contain the Revelation to produce a body change if it did that first church Aid should have been raptured 2 000 years ago if preaching the New Testament will produce a body change I ask you why did not the first church AIDS go up why did they die because God was given them what they needed that was the anointing that was released for them but it did not contain rapturing faiths it contained a face that would keep them until their deaths and then what would they need a face to believe that God would raise them from the dead which is not the same thing as a rapturing faith so many of ours mine the last couple of years we've had several of our Saints to pass and go on but yet we believe I believe with all of my heart there's people sitting right here tonight that will never face death that will never die yes I'm an old man I understand I'm an old man too I'm looking for the come of the Lord every day that I get up he didn't come today well yeah but he might come tomorrow if it don't come tomorrow looking for him the next day because I believe we are that close well if if the face of just preaching what Paul said and just going back to that it did not Rapture them it won't Rapture me I need a message that will bring Rapture in faith you need your sick you need healing and your body you need to be able to hear something that'll build your faith to a level of Divine Healing is that right you need a devil cast out you need a lust or so whatever it is you're dealing with you need to hear something that'll build your faith that'll let you know that God's not dead but he's the same yesterday today and forever if we're going to take a rapture we need preachers to be in the word under the anointing of the end time to be able to preach to their people a message that will not only help them to survive laodicea but defile lay of the sin not just have enough Faith to be buried in the ground but have enough Faith to be standing one morning and all of a sudden a sweep goes over you and your sales and your bones and your muscles and your hair and everything about your mortal body will be changed at a moment in a twinkling of an eye [Applause] noticing the prophet said it was the last Church age message calling them out of Babylon these churches were caught in the cage with her with her dogmas denying the word and accepting dogmas but this is the angel of Light to the laodicean church the angel of Light to the laodicean church so what's he going to do he's going to bring light now don't get in your mind that brother random come to replace the Bible he didn't he said that the Bible become an Uber not a replaced book okay women no longer read the Bible I I still preach the justification but I'm preaching under the opening of The Seven Seals I preach sanctification but under the opening of The Seven Seals I preach Faith healing Deliverance but why under the opening of The Seven Seals Wesley prayed for the sin my goodness the man was out riding one day going to a meeting his horse fell in a hole broke his leg he got down off the horse laid hands on the horse and God healed the horse and he went on and preached they believed in Divine Healing they had all kinds of healings and miracles in the days of the preachers of the haymarkets and they would go out there they saw all kind of Supernatural So Divine Healing is not something new but we're not just preaching Divine Healing I'm preaching a Divine house that will take you beyond the temporary Divine Healing that will move you into an eternal body well you'll never get sick again praise the Lord amen do you believe that now notice he said on the Angel's message let's jump down here in the bottom part of this paragraph the messenger come from God was echoing his message on the earth which was come out of Babylon now notice again in Revelation 18 2 John said he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful birth I want you to sing this is how God looks at whatever this Babylon is and it's amazing because there are billions of people on the face of the Earth that belong to this Babylonian move and there are millions of others that don't actually belong to it by name but they are a daughter of the same move and they think it's so wonderful it never ceases to amaze me how spiritually dumb people can be because something that God curses and something that God says is against his word and people will embrace it as if it's the greatest thing that ever hit the Earth you ought to thank God tonight for light now notice how fast whatever this is how vast it is in verse 3 for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her fornication with her and the merchants of the earth so she must be a move that has power with Kings and she is a move that has been identified in all types of money making schemes and all types of manufacturing and productivity and things that are bought and sold reckon who that would be I read a few of these to you the other night most of you probably don't remember them so I'm going to read them to you again 30 years ago the Vatican bank had 10 billion dollars invested in foreign companies now this is 30 years ago you imagine what it is now the vaults hold at least one metric ton of gold 31 million dollars was seized from the Vatican Bank by the Italian authorities during an investigation into money laundering now that don't mean they was washing their hundred dollar bills but they was trying to hide them from the government and being able to know what they had two billion dollars was paid out as settlements by the church for sex abuse cases just in the United States two billion dollars in 2011 one offering the Peter's Pence brought in 86 million dollars one offering 86 million dollars the Sistine Chapel offers a look at how difficult it is to be able to appraise all of this estimates range from 400 billion all the way up to two trillion dollars just for this one Masterpiece now I've stood there in this place it is absolutely unbelievable and remarkable and this is only one of their buildings that they own and possess around the world so we're not looking then at a church that specializes in casting out Devils Healing The Sick laying hands on them baptize them in the name of the Lord Jesus but what we're looking at is a system and a church that has all kinds of money invested in schemes and bonds and stocks well come on now so it's not a soul-saving station it's a soul damning station look friends playing talk is easy understood If You're Expecting for me to water this down tonight and keep all this head from it you all don't know me well do you notice this the Catholic church is the largest top most Christian organization which has an estimated wealth of more than 30 billion dollars in 2022. now remember this is only what's traceable that's only what traceable there ain't no telling what all they have uh you ought to see some of the pictures that I've been able to find in the miles of caves and all that's underneath the Vatican itself of the wells that was stolen from the Jews and stolen from different ones even as far back as World War II and a lot of the treasures and the things that they have oh my you know what they think that's great wealths one day they'll find out it's nothing estimation of its net worth comes from its ownership of properties including churches schools presbyteries hospitals nursing homes offices tennis courts and telephone Towers wow and where does that fit in the original thing go you therefore and preach the gospel cast out Devils heal the sick raise the Dead can't you see they are not interested in getting folks saved apart from this Catholic development funds Catholic Church insurance and Telecommunications are the resource of their wealth oh my goodness the Catholic church is basically not one organization economically it runs the largest network of charitable organizations in the world and it's never so easy to calculate the exact wealth of their Foundation but their assets are likely worth billions and billions of dollars I guess that leaves us out anybody in here got billions really Millions thousands anybody got a couple nickels you could rub together and you folks think you're worth something you think you've got wealth that the world knows nothing about us anybody here on a telecommunication satellite really so y'all y'all don't know thousands and thousands of Acres of property and and you don't own any satellites out there and eat on musk and all that can do this and that at the Catholic Church said all this and some of you uh just barely get by and you can feel the pain of inflation every time you buy groceries and go to the gas station you have to worry about it don't you you know why because you ain't got a whole lot of wealth in this world but aren't you glad you've got it laid up for inflation don't affect it I'm so glad I'm not a rich man I could have been a millionaire yeah I could have been I could have been a millionaire a few times over actually but I decided a long long time ago me and my little wife were sitting down on the porch of our single wide trailer down in Kentucky for you folks ever knew me and we're sitting out there just talking about the Lord and his goodness and his mercy and we said Lord we just sat there and prayed together and held hands we said Lord we don't know exactly what you want us to do but if you got something for us in our life Lord just help us to be able to do what you want you want to put things in our hands we'll put it back into your hands you want to be able to commit this to us little did I know what my future held but I've realized a long time ago it's not so much what you keep that makes you great it's what you give away you know you'll never be rewarded for all that you've kept in life for yourself your reward will be for those things you've given away oh praise the lord well some of you got quiet over there what happened my goodness some of y'all satis you pull the hair Plum off of George Washington hahaha notice this the Vatican has billions of shares in the most powerful International corporations in the world such as Gulf oil Shell Oil General Motors so when you crank your vehicle after church rub it and thank the Pope General Motors Bethlehem Steel General Electric International Business Machines you see John did not even know who the Catholic church was he never saw all the business Adventures that they were going to make but he spoke those words as if though he was reading from Google the very things I read to you just now but that's the way prophets of God spoke they spoke when there was nothing there they spoke when none of this existed that they spoke with the faith of God and knew one day it would and here you are tonight standing here and say my Lord I live in that day this day this scripture is fulfilled [Applause] so if I get thrown in jail over this I hope some of y'all at least come see me as the largest non-governmental landowner in the world the Catholic church has a mass a diverse Global portfolio of parishes schools monasteries cemeteries hospitals care facilities and combining to be an estimated as far as land and all of that 177 million Acres a property this is only as I said what is traceable oh my banker's best guess is about the vatican's wealth put it out between 10 to 15 billion dollars of this wealth Italian stock Holdings alone run 1.6 15 percent of the whole Italian stock market value is owned by the Catholic Church no wonder when Russia bombs her the shipbuilders looked at her smoke and they wept and they cried all these people of industry and commerce do you think they'd do that for us message folks if something happened to all of us in this oh no there goes all my money oh no there goes all my telecommunication satellite oh no yeah there goes this and there goes that would hardly even be missed when we're gone from this world hardly nobody will know we're gone it'll just be a group of people that come up missing swept out of here by the presence of God and we'll Say Goodbye World goodbye I've seen all this world I want to say what about you oh my the Vatican has investments in banking Insurance chemicals steel construction real estate oil Telecommunications there's just part of what I know they don't own and that's what's made in China they're probably on that too what's more than one billion followers the largest religion with more than one billion adherents a Catholic Church is the largest non-governmental landowner in the world they own equivalent to 277 000 square miles on the face of the Earth they better enjoy it because I'm fixing to take it over and I won't have to fire one shot I want you to notice as John when he goes down through verse 1 then to verse 2 and on down to verse 4. and he says I heard another voice now you'll notice this when you're reading the book of Revelation that John to identify either another Angelic being or another being of deity or another being that is being anointed on Earth by an Angelic anointing he will use the word time and time again another Voice or another Angel what is it it changes from the one he just saw to another now it's moving from this seventh angel which has proclaimed with a loud voice come out of her my people and he said get out of that mess get out of it now I want you to notice that what the prophet said is going to be echoed from heaven this shows the continuity and the closeness that this Prophet had in relationship to God now watch this in verse 4 and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people now this is not that angel of Revelation 10 of the Revelation 18 1 but this is another voice and what was this voice this voice was from heaven and he said come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins that you receive not her place you see there is a danger in the timeline to where we stay into something so long that that becomes our identification of Who We Are now notice God calling to his own well I'm glad we heard that call come out of her my people why because there's a timeline to where you cross it there be not partakers of our sins look at this word for taker it means to come together with others or to have fellowship with a thing to have Fellowship so you don't actually even you know totally agree with it but yet you fellowship with that move and you don't stand against it you see the time is coming to where every individual must make their choice and some people love the world of neutrality they're just you know yell as they can be and they ain't got a backbone at all and they just love neutrality well I hate to say anything against anybody I just love everybody you know I'm not going to say nothing against no denomination we got some of our jelly bone preachers on the message that do the same thing man got a bit more right to call to preach the gospel and then the groundhog does and they stand behind the pulpit and they polish every word and think it through and they ain't going to offend nobody even the devil well I'll tell you one thing if I preach one sermon and it don't tear hell up I need to repent of it Ah that's exactly right I think we ought to preach we ought to sing We ought to live that the devil hates every day I live on this Earth I hope if I go by the way of the grave and you all have my funeral that hell breaks out an ordained smile they shout from one end of Hell to the other and say glory to God that Holy Roller is gone wouldn't it be awful that whenever we're having your funeral that the demons down in hell are crying and sobbing like a rat eating onions and they're saying oh Lord oh goodness I use her all the time in the church I used him all the time in the church to cause trouble what are we going to do now Lord God don't let that be my testimony but let them Devils jump let them shout let them do whatever oh we're so glad he's gone he tormented us since he was a little boy and once he come to the trueness of the godhead he tormented us a little more I don't believe God just wants the preachers to torment the devil I believe God wants every man woman boy and girl that's filled with the Holy Ghost to let hail know you are here you're a daughter of God you're a Son of God and you were ordained to torment hell you were ordained to turn it the devil now what's the prophet again in this paragraph 207 why I'm against organized religion and he deals with this verse 4. look immediately after her mystery was made known who she was what she was who her daughters was the mystery had been made known then God sent an angel a messenger to what call out then he says the message off the hour so the message of the hour is not just God sent a prophet but what did he have to say when he got here that's the message of the hour don't just tell me God sent a prophet tell me what he said tell me what he said about living tell me what he said about gifts tell me what he said about going to church tell me what he said about how men ought to treat their wives how we ought to treat our children is that right somebody tell me what he said come out of her my people that should be not partakers with her plagues listen he said he's going to curse her come out of her God sent a mighty angel or a messenger and his light wasn't in a corner it's scattered over the Earth come out of her what her and her sisters to lighten the Earth call these people out now you know that's the truth a messenger was sent from God to God God's people out of Babylon and his light lighted the Earth the great Holy Spirit notice this Angel is the last messenger before the coming of Christ myself I'm not looking for another Prophet to rise on the Earth I'm not looking for an old Malachi four and a half point five or Malachi 4 6 version 2. I believe we don't have that message and I don't think God's got any pastors any teachers any evangelists on the earth that are sent to correct that Prophet neither well praise the Lord what we're called to do is stand up and say what he said say right there and lay it right out just the way he preach it don't water it down don't weaken It uncle brother Donnie people won't like it I know they won't like it but God will like it if you say what God Said God will back you up [Applause] look friends if God don't stand with me when I preach the truth leave if God backs up what men of God preach listen carefully to them follow the teaching that they're giving you because God will speak behind his servants notice he said oh my this I love this so much if we notice when he gave his voice on the earth there was a voice echoed again in heaven if you want to read it the message on the Earth was so inclined with God until when he spoke it on the earth God echoed the same thing Out of Heaven wow can you imagine how privileged we are to set under the the message of a prophet of God in this day that he says something on the earth and almighty God says the same thing out of heaven and Echoes the same message praise the Lord then I'll tell you one thing to me that ain't something to walk away from that ain't something to take lightly well I only want this and I only like that and I only want this not me brother I'll let God do all that sort of thing I just want to believe it obey it and live it don't you and say what has already been said oh my what is the fourth verse translation he said what does it mean God's voice speaking to his predestinated people saying come out of her amen just exactly what the voice was he's got people all out in there all out through Babylon come out of her that you don't be partakers of her sins of her dogmas and her and the Creeds and this is what you're coming to to the word made spirit and life and what does the majority of the world many of them don't even hear about this ah Holy Roller cult following a man we don't deny that would you rather follow a man or a well come on now look here in the Book of Revelation you're going to follow a man that's messenger sent out of Revelation 18 or you're going to follow this whole move well ah goodness I'll stay with the man myself notices of the 19th Chapter he said did you notice here after these things watch after what the message of come out of her then he said is the shout of the Bride Saints with the bridegroom going to the marriage of the Lamb Revelation 19 it's whenever the great consummation of this takes place let us be glad and rejoice and make Merry for the marriage of the Lamb is come when does that come after this voice calls us out in Revelation 18 4 come out of her my people and it was a sign that we come out because we rejoiced and we said hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we heard the voice of God we heard God speak through a man and we heard the same spirit of God echoing from Heaven look what did you hear when you heard the message of the hour I didn't just hear a Kentuckian I didn't just hear a man that never had a high school education I heard a voice behind the voice something else what was it doing it was calling my name what about yours it was calling you out of that system you were in and was not only doing that it's calling you to separate from yourself Hallelujah God don't want me to just come out of the church God wants me to come out of me [Applause] then he asked this question how close are we then brother what's the last call come out of Babylon now my brethren that's the reason I'm against that can you imagine now this is a change in his ministry the end of 62. he's fixing to go into another place and always God would tell him come away from them Brethren sanctify yourself remember when the Angels is going to appear to him he said separate yourself from them brothers what was it for a sanctification a set of partners that God could deal with him oh Hallelujah now he's fixing to introduce something different so he preaches this may those great sermons the end of 62 and then he consummates that was this as a sign of the end time sir and the vision of the Lord come and he began to see those seven angels what was it 63 was becoming a new turn something was fixing to happen little did he know that in February that seven angels would come in the constellation and then in March he'd come back in Jeffersonville and the breaking of those seals when he went right back to the old notes that he had preached years and years ago and he said I would have made a horrible mistake today but the angel of the Lord come in the room and corrected me do you understand what those seals was he said each angel came each day and made the mystery known which was only known to them don't you understand it was the theophany as it was of Paul that come down that first revelation on that first seal every messenger Church age messenger that must have been awesome when it's all Paul it must have been awesome when he saw erroneous that I imagine it must have been asked someone he saw himself well glory to God when the seventh angel come to the seventh angel and he began to reveal that secret that was made known in the last day the seventh Church age the seventh watch the seventh seal the breaking of it all where in your time frame in your age [Applause] but you see it's at the end of this that his ministry is changing and this of course is when the denominations begin to say false prophet he had a great ministry they say but he got off at the end which is where we figure he really got on you listen to him in 65 and you'll hear him say himself it's not when the seventh angel first started out but when he sounded his message he said Jesus was really loved when he first started out oh Rabbi come here Rabbi come there but when he stood up and said I and my father are one oh brother Branham they loved him around the world none of them could touch him as long as they just pray for the sick they didn't want him to preach because they didn't think he was called to preach he didn't have no doctor's degree and wasn't even a license probably by another organization because he turned his ministerial card in so they thought all he was called to do was to be able to lay hands on the sick and they'd recover they didn't know that what he was doing was casting out bait to catch the rainbow trout hey man all that healing all that Miracle yes it was absolutely wonderful but he was baiting and getting ready he said hey man he ain't just saying in the little Menace on the top he's after rainbow trout rainbow Covenant people and that sign will get their attention and they'll hear it and then they'll set her under the presence of the word and all of a sudden the light of God will begin to Break Forth on the sea Gene in their soul and they'll say I see it glory to God I see it I see what he's talking about oh God I see it [Applause] and all many of them got was the fish your name is so-and-so you want to adultery I see your doctor had a sent man got glasses on don't you live on 22nd 8th Street your doctor's heavy said guy this you was there three days ago I mean they're just sitting there just gobbling lime sink or hook oh but it become toward the discernment was an entertainment and whenever he'd rest himself in the prayer lines and pull the gift of discernment over and just lay hands on them then what would happen people's faith that start down there now friend don't do that he's still here he's still he's still here and then he come back again now brother you know you've got this and this and why their faith washed their faith it would climb right back up again but look what he was doing it was building upon entertainment and that's what he said he had to apologize he said God forgive me I point it to the sign I pointed to the sign instead of the city he said if you're going to a certain city and you come up and there's a sign there and he said you don't stop at the sign but the sign is pointing you in the direction of the city and he said God forgive me I I pointed the people to the side when I should have been pointing them to the city oh don't you understand when he come out from under the first and second pull and went into the third pole what was it pointing to the city instead of the sign but you see some of the Cardinal minded message people they're still pointing to the sign itself it's time we get a hold of ourselves and realize amen is the city we're looking for [Applause] so with this phase people start leaving him start pulling away I always knew there's something funny I knew he was really weird but it just kept right on preaching I imagine he got so discouraged he wrote a letter in 1962 to a brother down in North Carolina Parker Thomas was his name he begins to explain to the brother how the gift begin to change and how as the word went on revealing itself that the people started pulling away pulling away having no more to do with him by the time it got to the end of his ministry a lot of the doors had shut in his face lived in Tucson forever so long According To None the preachers would invite him to come and preach can you imagine brother Brown Living in Johnson City and that's not inviting encourage but what did they miss the voice of Revelation 18. that offends me oh he blessed my church uh he he told me I'd have to quit cutting my hair and I'd have to do that that offends me just pray for me to get well and mind your own business and don't tell us what to do but it just kept sowing seed so unsafe I know you know this but you realize many of the Great sermons that we listen to on tape were preached at Ramada Inns the Rapture sermon was preached at the Ramada Inn by the Earl Williams told me he was there the people were standing on the back of the building you were too brother Harvey brother told me that the people were standing on the back of the building waving their hands trying to get brother Branham to stop I'm glad he didn't now that had a meal that that damn breakfast or dinner whatever it was and brother Rams just kept right on going oh I'm so glad he kept on going oh my right turn the Ramada in when the first time the Revelation struck the Earth about the mystery of the Rapture it wasn't in a church but a Ramada there was room for Jesus in the end then there's room for Jesus in the end now mm-hmm notice this in Revelation 18 5 her sins have reached unto heaven her sins have reached unto heaven and God has remembered her iniquities it's not so much now that their sins are accumulation and accumulating in a mass or a pile and they're piling up in one power but they become so great you know there's difference of times in the Old Testament God come down to check Sodom and Gomorrah to see if it was the way it sounded and the way it heard remember Genesis 4 10. speaking to Cain he said why has what is thou done the voice of God brother's blood Christ unto me from the ground and God heard her sins God remembered God remembered every time John tetzel went through the time of the Dark Ages and started selling novenas because the church needed money so John tetzel is the Catholic Church representative begin to move from one city to another and come up magnified the ideology of being able to pray your family out of purgatory so you imagine you got an uncle that died and he wasn't right wasn't ready to meet God and your leader comes and tells you if you'll give us so much money we'll get him out of purgatory for you now maybe if you didn't have enough to pay the whole cash bail they would at least try to shorten his time there I'm glad we Bible Believers don't even believe in purgatory brother random said there is a Purgatory right now but it's it's right now we're going through it we're being purged by the washing of the water of the word but can you imagine you've got money you say my daddies are in purgatory he's there if I give them 500 who would say it would cut his time in half well who wouldn't that had enough money wouldn't do it so they started selling these indulgences and novenas God said it started reaching up so they got a saint for protection and they got a saint for health and they got a saint for this my luck I'd forgive which Saint it was and I'd call on the saint of broccoli and me needing a Deliverance for something oh oh all right aren't you glad you've only got one name to remember in the time of trouble and in the time of difficulty it ain't Saint Cecilia for a headache and Saint John for this it's the power powerful name of the Lord Jesus Christ It cast out Devils it heals the sick and it don't cost you one penny Hallelujah he purchased it for you [Applause] I've read this it seems where John said and God has remembered her iniquities Lord God you see remembrance of iniquity signifies a level of non-forgiveness Lord children can you imagine how much sin we would accumulate in a lifetime of just a mortar if we live 55 60 65 years old whatever we'd be and it would be an accumulation of stuff every day that we did and we had to stand before God at the end of our life with no blood to wash us for the gym can you imagine how horrible how wretched we would be and yet this system has been alive for hundreds almost 2 000 years so her monks her Jesuits her Bishops how many little boys have they fooled with and ruined them their life oh sat there and look at me like you know what I'm talking about what about those they've damned to hell with her false Doctrine so you do something wrong say 13 Hail Marys Hail Mary Mother of God pray for us sinners now the time of our departure amen so you repeat that 15 times what good does it do not one bit so it's accumulated through the Dark Ages accumulated when Luther saw the lighter the Reformation but now God says it's God's Soul accumulated I remember and now Grace has left the sanctuary Mercy's gone says I remember a little boy every little child you molested have a woman you told her to pray and say Hail Mary the rosary you imagine Peter having a rosary around his neck oh come on no said there look at me oh I know some of you all just your Fox friends favorites but if you ever listen to them some of them people are very close they pray to the Roser like any other Catholic does don't make them people your hero make Jesus Christ your hero amen over the dolly Fox and Friends I'd Rather Have Jesus and his friends they're real friends that'll stick with you oh my so the punishment of the sin is brought about by the remembrance Lord have mercy I'm so glad I won't be punished by my remembrance anybody in here to not remember things you've done wrong that you wish you hadn't have done wrong and you wished somehow the Lord rest the Goodman used to sing a song years and years ago Lord pay my mind with the blood of calvary wash something in the saw in the heart of that artist what not only sold to be painted why there you begin to relive those failures those mistakes me once they get past it but I'm so glad just because I remember they don't praise God you see that's one of the revelations of justification Luther preached justification it was wonderful in that light friends we preached justification not in the same light Luther did we preached justification that it's not you're forgiven from it you never did it in the first place looser did not preach it that way why how could we preach it that way the opening of The Seven Seals hallelujah it's not like well God will forgive you but he'll always remember no justification unto the Seven Seals what that seeking inside of you never done it in the first place it wasn't you it was that old nature you was married to but you never done it where do we get that at under the evening light Hallelujah then what does that do for us it brings us down to Invisible Union that he took your old book of divorcement Hallelujah he didn't just hiding under his arm and said all right I'm going to wash your eye now if he messes up I'm dragging out this book no that's the way we do one another and you husbands and wives that are getting into arguments and forgive one another of this and that and the other and then the next argument you bring it right back up again shame on you you need to forgive and you need to move on you need to move on by the grace of God don't be like the devil the devil is the one that brings back our sins and our mistakes but we need to move into the realm of God's grace and mercy and forgive from our hearts whew so God but God has just allowed a group of people and how about the time this is going on to come into His presence and he looks at them and said I want to say I don't ever remember you being anything or my daughter he's not acting he's not just saying that because that's you know it just sounds good he honors safe cannot remember God can do so many things but the blood of Jesus is so powerful it erases our past and he cannot wait that's more than my little puny mind can comprehend anybody and you're with me but it's not like it's just well I'll just I'll just act like he's not acting his mind is so released from our past then Carol will sit and have a heart-to-heart talks from time to time we shouldn't have one that long ago and she said thank you for loving me and she said I'm sure that I've I've disappointed you so many times I said probably not know as many times I've disappointed you she said I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me for every time I've ever hurt you or disappointed you I said Carol to be honest with you mainly all I remember about you and about our marriage about our time together it's not your failures it's not your shortcomings it's about what a great friend you've been to me what a companion you've been what an encouragement you've been to me and sometimes when I just absolutely felt like walking away from the pulpit and never preaching another sermon so discouraged that I didn't feel like even doing it again I know some of you find it may find it hard to believe but I have been so discouraged at times I didn't even have the strength I said just a few weeks ago with my laptop in my lap I was so distraught and so discouraged couldn't even study I had four Microsoft windows open with different things going I had four different message Windows going four different Bible Windows going all different kinds of things open and I sat there and I sat there and I looked at it I just thought I just can't do it I closed the lid on my laptop and laid it down beside my chair I sat there and started shaking uncontrollably my feet were shaking in my chair my face was shaking my hands my whole body went into this convulsion of sitting there shaking wow but you know what that little woman of mine does when she sees me discouraged she'll get in my face and she'll say God calls you don't you let the devil defeat you [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] so if the Lord puts it on your heart some Wednesday morning at 3 30 in the morning don't call me at 3 30 please because I might have just went to sleep but to write me a card or send me a text obey him because you never know what I'm going through you never know that person that God puts on your heart oh my so you see when God calls us he don't eradicate all of our Humanity you imagine brother Branham brother Charlie Cox told me one time that brother Banks was living right next door to brother Branham he went into his house and brother random was sitting there with his head down in his hands crying and he asked sister media what's wrong with him what's wrong is he sick she said he don't know if he's called a preacher or not Elijah you see one day all this Humanity will be laid aside and I'll finally be able to have a mind that's like God I'll never again remember my weaknesses my failures bummer Stakes and neither were you Hallelujah Hallelujah listen in Revelation 18 6 reward her even as she rewarded you double unto her devil according to her works in the cup which you have filled to her double wow so this is how God is going to deal with this God says give her double of what she's done reward her double well you think about it on the grace side Jesus said we'll come up before in that day and say enter into the joys of the Lord you have been faithful over a few things but I'm going to reward you with many our little position in life will be so small No Doubt we'll live our life and go and in in a few years even if you're a great preacher just a few years and people heart even remember you you'll be gone just back to the dust as far as the body your memory will fade in time that's just the way it's always been but what little bit that we've done for the kingdom of God when we stand before him that day it will be so great in his eyes that's on this side of Grace but on the other side of Grace when you have sins that aren't forgiven he says about these people double what they've done double it let me jump over here just a little this is how I can have confidence in what's fixing to happen in this last days that God listen to this remember I say this as God's prophet the Russian Empire now remember not USSR the Russian Empire will drop an atomic bomb of some sort that's another way he says this of some sort on the Vatican City and destroy it in one hour thus saith the Lord she will be destroyed in one hour and while that's going on on here you'll be up there in another dimension then in that Realm you won't be able to remember your past either wouldn't that be awesome just to wake up in the morning and all of your past was just gone couldn't remember one mistake wow that that would pretty much be heaven on Earth wouldn't it would never remember any bad thing brother Levi nothing we've ever said or done or whatever it is oh be faithful children Lord Jesus we may go through this life father never be important people no doubt the majority of your people will never be in the who's who they will never receive a personal invitation from the president to come to the White House or some Senator or congressman come to their home and visit him most people will just never have that type of acknowledgment but yet the king of kings the Lord of lords the almighty God come down to this earth to take our sin upon himself oh Jesus how we thank you for that Lord I know tonight if our sins were to be remembered that wouldn't be one of us in this place or one under the sound of my voice that would want to stand before you and give an account of our sins and what makes us different there's not a doubt in my mind these popes these Bishops these Friars these monks they've read in the Bible they know Acts 2 38 they know it but they turn it down and they say the Bible is not what's important it's the church but when the church has been annihilated with an atomic bomb you said heavens and earth shall pass away but my word shall never pass away so Lord we don't want to be a part of this Babylon we want to be a part of that word because if we're a part of that word when Rome is destroyed when our nation fulfills the seventh vision when Russia blows our nation into such a position that the LIE saying the prophet saw was craters and smoke it didn't say anything about seeing one life human being Lord we know with the Satan II Russia's great powerful missile that can carry up to 10 Ward heads with many more times kilotons of power that was in the drama on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and when he comes up in the atmosphere miles above the Earth chamber will pull apart and each Warhead will be programmed one to Chicago one to Washington one to New Mexico one to Oak Ridge we have nothing in our Armory so far that can be able to even catch it it'll move so fast Lord God I'm so grateful that we're going to be hid ing so Rock of Ages let the world laugh at us let him make fun of us Lord Jesus let them call us names but let you call us out of here that's what we're waiting for if there's one year tonight Lord who needs the Holy Ghost if there's one father that there's a sin that hangs over him it's not so much in the past but it's in the present Lord God help him I pray in the name of Jesus May the spirit of God help us as your children that every sin every shortcoming will be brought under our feet by the blood of the Lord Jesus glory be to God Hallelujah Lord for some who still live in that world of their past and their memories so imprints upon them and Lord they'll hear a song going through Walmart and through those and it'll carry them back decades ago when they were drinking and this and that and the other I pray you'd help them Lord we know those things that they're imprinted on our mind Lord Jesus may we be faithful to one day our minds will finally be changed painted with the blood of Jesus as it were then we will no longer ever remember being a sinner but all will ever be able to remember then we'll be burst into that word form body which was ours and in there will know all things and it's as if though our past life will cease to exist in our memory I don't know how you'll do it but Lord the prophet said we'll all get together in just a few moments he knows we'll be looking around to see if so-and-so made it or so and so and then after we greet one another something will happen to our minds and if Mama didn't make it brother didn't make it sister didn't make it it's like that Association of them in our life and our minds will be forever settled and separated and will never again think of them as Brethren or mother or father or uncle Heaven wouldn't be heaven as long as we had to think that way but it's like we'll be born into a new family the Eternal family and then all that we see will be our brothers and our sisters praise God and the slot will never have any association of Mama didn't make it and daddy didn't make it Uncle didn't make it maybe it didn't make a child didn't make it no it'll all be gone oh praise God we worship you tonight Lord Jesus Lord I don't want to wait till Revelation 19. I want to just go ahead and start saying them Praises tonight Hallelujah Hallelujah the Jews say there's four different categories of Psalms written in the Psalms by the psalmist David four different

wanted her to go through the prayer line that brother Branham had in 65 there in Shreveport I believe it was and whenever she had been doing some things that wasn't right she got into prayer lines her mom and daddy didn't know she was doing these things she was scared totally to death because she hadn't seen that Prophet call people out and tell them this and that and the other well from the time she got in the prayer line until she got up to where brother Branham was she repented and whenever she repented and got before that Prophet not one thing was mentioned about her past now that hadn't been repented of 45 years ago it just happened 15 or 20 minutes ago but it was so taken care of that God couldn't even show it to his prophet that's the Jesus I'm talking about tonight oh don't hold
