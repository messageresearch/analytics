[41:42] now that's pretty hard sometimes when
[41:44] you've got a giant standing before you
[41:47] with eyeballs about that big real the
[41:51] head size of a
[41:53] washtub 20ft spear
[41:57] his coat of mail and his weight put
[41:59] together would have been about 1,000
[42:03] pounds but faith can look at it and said
[42:07] all that weight is going to work against
[42:09] you all your bragging and all your
[42:12] boasting is going to work against you
[42:14] that's the way Faith looks at it we
[42:17] welcome you tonight appreciate the
[42:19] opportunity for us to be together we're
[42:21] going to invite Brother David if he'll
[42:23] come had a wonderful service here last
[42:25] night and we're looking for the Lord to
[42:26] just come again and move for us in a
[42:28] wonderful way U all the youths that are
[42:32] here with us that are visiting from
[42:33] other churches and other states we
[42:35] welcome you we trust that it'll be a
[42:37] blessing for the effort and all that you
[42:39] put forth to be here be sure and greet
[42:41] your family when you go back home for us
[42:43] in your your home Church wherever you're
[42:45] from we want to try to uh treat you
[42:49] welcome while you're here and I just
[42:51] believe that the Lord will also make a
[42:54] blessing for each of us we're thankful
[42:56] that God has given us the opportunity
[42:58] for our youth to gather I've said it to
[43:00] our own youths before U I never got to
[43:03] go to a young people's service whenever
[43:05] I was a young
[43:06] teenager I started preaching when I was
[43:08] 18 so the first youth service I attended
[43:11] I preached it so you all don't know how
[43:14] blessed you are to be able to have youth
[43:16] services and you have so many in the
[43:19] message anymore it's hard to make your
[43:21] choice of where you want to go right so
[43:23] you can go here you can go there and
[43:25] we're grateful for that so it can be a
[43:27] able to be a blanket coverage and make
[43:29] it available for our use but I know you
[43:31] understand it but I just want to remind
[43:33] you the reason your pastors and your
[43:35] churches and the evangelists and the
[43:38] ministers that come and preach in them

[48:42] to the young people tonight and ask the
[48:44] Lord to just take his word something to
[48:47] challenge your faith tonight um it's
[48:49] going to be a little bit strange but I
[48:51] think sometimes saying it in strange
[48:54] ways kind of gets our attention and help
[48:56] us
[48:57] Matthew 14
[48:59] and22 and straightway Jesus
[49:03] constrained his disciples to get into a
[49:06] ship and to go before him andto the
[49:09] other side while he sent the multitudes
[49:11] away and when he had sent the multitudes
[49:14] away Glory he went up into a high
[49:17] mountain apart to pray and when the
[49:19] evening was come he was there alone but
[49:23] the ship was now in the midst of the sea
[49:26] it was tossed with waves for the wind
[49:28] was contrary and in the Fourth Watch of
[49:31] the night Jesus went unto them walking
[49:35] on the sea and when the disciples saw
[49:39] him walking on the sea they were
[49:41] troubled saying it's a spirit and they
[49:44] cried out for fear but straightway Jesus
[49:48] spake unto them saying be of good cheer
[49:52] it is I Be not
[49:54] Afraid and Peter answered answered him
[49:57] and said Lord if it be thou bid me to
[50:01] come to thee on the water and Jesus said
[50:06] I love this just one words all Peter
[50:08] needed and he said come and when Peter
[50:12] was come down out of the ship he walked
[50:15] on the water to go to Jesus like to
[50:19] speak on this subject tonight the Lord
[50:21] will help us stepping out of the boat
[50:24] may the Lord add His blessings to the
[50:25] word you can be seated
[50:32] tonight
[50:37] yeah we know that we're living in a time
[50:41] period to where our faith is TR truly
[50:45] going to be tested in the day that we're
[50:47] living in we know that our faith is
[50:50] going to be
[50:52] tested uh our belief the things that we
[50:55] say that we believe our belief will be
[50:58] tested if we testify that it is the
[51:00] truth I believe that that belief is
[51:02] going to be tested not only will our
[51:05] faith now not only will our belief but I
[51:09] believe that our fervency is going to be
[51:11] tested if we say that we believe
[51:13] something and we stand upon it and we
[51:16] are uh we we are so focused to believe
[51:19] with everything that that is the truth I
[51:21] believe that we will have to be tested
[51:24] and what God reveals to us Satan will
[51:27] make sure that we're tested whether we
[51:29] truly believe that or not and because of
[51:32] this test that we go through the prophet
[51:34] makes this statement out of
[51:35] second-handed robe and he says I realize
[51:38] that every time Faith sets itself up
[51:42] that the devil will turn every gun in
[51:45] hell right on it like that so every time
[51:49] that Faith would arise and it will begin
[51:51] to raise up the prophet said that's when
[51:54] Satan turns every gun against that faith
[51:58] that raises up the moment you say that
[52:00] you believe and the moment that you
[52:02] testify of what God's done for you and
[52:04] how that God has moved for you the
[52:06] moment that you take a stand that you
[52:09] say that you're going to serve God I'm
[52:11] going to live for God I'm going to
[52:13] believe God Satan will do everything he
[52:16] can to come against that faith that
[52:18] raises up he'll send every imp and
[52:21] everything that hell has to offer he'll
[52:23] send it against you to try to stop that
[52:26] fa Faith from being able to raise up
[52:29] he'll send troubles your way he'll send
[52:31] turmoils your way all kinds of stress
[52:34] all kinds of pressure will come against
[52:36] you and you will never even be able to
[52:39] dream of the things that Satan will
[52:40] bring against you to try to try the
[52:43] faith that you say that you got and
[52:46] because of the great battles that we
[52:48] face I thought of this tonight to be
[52:50] able to deliver this to you and it's
[52:53] going to sound strange but I would
[52:56] personally
[52:57] like to have the ability to be able to
[52:59] walk on
[53:01] water and one
[53:04] amen I would like to have the abil I'm
[53:07] being just as honest as I can be I would
[53:10] love to have the ability to be able to
[53:13] walk on the water now that may sound
[53:15] crazy and that may sound like you know
[53:17] you've lost your mind but I'm not
[53:20] talking about a river and I'm not
[53:22] talking about a lake I'm not talking
[53:24] about a pond but I'm talking about life
[53:27] itself many different times the prophet
[53:29] would tell us he said that life is like
[53:32] a sea and he said the sea whenever the
[53:35] wind comes across the water he said the
[53:37] sea becomes unstable and he said when it
[53:40] becomes unstable he said the waves begin
[53:43] to grow higher and higher as the wind
[53:46] moves across the water and because life
[53:49] is that way we realize that life is
[53:51] unstable and life is uncertain it's
[53:54] always moving and things is always
[53:57] changing and you know you think you got
[53:59] all of it figured out and all of a
[54:01] sudden Everything Changes in life it
[54:03] tosses us to and fro because we're
[54:05] constantly on this sea over and over
[54:08] again and the prophet would tell us a
[54:10] lot of times that life is like storms
[54:13] that that whips upon the sea and he
[54:15] causes the sea to be unstable and
[54:18] brother says that's the kind of age that
[54:20] we're living in it's an age that is
[54:23] unstable it's a age of uncertainty the
[54:26] prophet said and I hear him say today
[54:29] it's a day that the four the the the the
[54:31] actual moral fibers of humanity has
[54:35] absolutely completely gone from even
[54:38] Humanity not just in motherhood not just
[54:41] in fatherhood but Humanity alone the
[54:44] moral fibs is all but gone and David
[54:47] said it like this when David talked
[54:49] about the time of the Rapture in Psalms
[54:51] 27 he said it's going to be a time of
[54:53] trouble and it is it'll be a time
[54:56] distress and it is and how true is it
[54:59] today there has never been a time of
[55:02] such uncertainty as what there is right
[55:04] now and I want to be very honest with
[55:07] you young people you cannot expect for
[55:10] the Seas to remain calm you cannot
[55:13] expect to have calm Waters you cannot
[55:16] expect the days of calm Waters is over
[55:19] as a matter of fact the prophet tells us
[55:22] it's going to get worse and worse and
[55:24] worse I hear the prophet say today day
[55:26] he said brother Ram tells us he said
[55:28] that he said it's going to continually
[55:31] he said he said one place he looks at it
[55:33] he said it will gradually get worse and
[55:35] then brother random stops and he said no
[55:38] not gradually it's going to rapidly get
[55:40] worse until Jesus comes that tells me
[55:44] that the waters are going to continue to
[55:46] be contrary that tells me that man is
[55:49] going to be contrary not only will man
[55:51] governments are going to be that way
[55:53] people's going to be that way the waters
[55:56] are going to be rough and the waves are
[55:58] going to be high and that's because I
[56:00] want the ability if the water's going to
[56:03] be high and the waves are going to be
[56:05] high I want the ability to walk on
[56:09] water amen you realize because of the
[56:13] uncertainty of humanity that people
[56:15] don't even know who they are they don't
[56:18] even know what they are they don't know
[56:20] what they're supposed to be and they're
[56:22] they're running here and there trying to
[56:24] find answers you know and they go to
[56:25] psych atrist to try to get an answer but
[56:28] the problem is the psychiatrists are
[56:30] going to psychiatrist and the reason why
[56:32] is they're looking for some kind of help
[56:35] but the psychiatrist does not have the
[56:37] answer doctors don't have the answer our
[56:40] government doesn't have the answer the
[56:43] pope doesn't have the answer everywhere
[56:45] we look there is trouble everywhere we
[56:48] look there is uncertainty but let me say
[56:50] this if I can walk on the water tonight
[56:54] no matter how contrary the water is no
[56:57] matter how high the waves are if I can
[56:59] walk on the water it doesn't
[57:05] matter I want the ability to walk over
[57:09] sickness I want the ability to walk over
[57:13] fear I want the ability to walk over
[57:16] stress and disease and walk over cancer
[57:19] I want to walk on the water
[57:24] tonight I may not be able to stop the
[57:27] waves and I may not be able to stop the
[57:30] storms but if I could just walk on that
[57:33] water I'm not asking God to calm the
[57:36] waters I'm not asking God to change it
[57:39] but says you ask for peace he said he
[57:41] gives you the best thing you need and
[57:43] it's not calm Waters but I do say
[57:46] tonight Lord let me walk on if if that's
[57:49] the way it's got to
[57:51] be I don't want to be tossed around like
[57:55] the rest of the world
[57:57] amen I don't want to be tossed like
[58:00] everybody else I want to walk on what
[58:03] other people sink
[58:07] in you say brother that's farfetched a
[58:10] why in the world when I sink to the
[58:13] bottom when I'm a son or you're a
[58:15] daughter of God why sink when you're
[58:18] God's a Creator why sink when we serve
[58:21] an all powerful all knowing all
[58:24] sufficient God why sink when you can
[58:27] walk on
[58:29] it I believe God's given us the
[58:32] authority Hallelujah I believe this I
[58:35] don't believe we have to sink into
[58:38] depression I don't believe we got to
[58:40] sink into fear I don't believe we got to
[58:43] sink and lower ourselves to the morals
[58:46] of the
[58:48] world I put up with if you can walk on
[58:51] the water that's our setting tonight our
[58:56] scene opens up with a storm on the Sea
[59:00] of Galilee and remember the prophet
[59:02] tells us that those storms on that sea
[59:06] but the sea would get all
[59:09] unstable and here are some disciples
[59:12] that's Crossing this water about the
[59:15] time the storm comes up now remember the
[59:18] prophet tells us they've been on that
[59:20] sea all night long but now it had come
[59:25] to the darkest
[59:26] watch of the night which was the fourth
[59:29] watch so it's the darkest time of the
[59:31] night it is the time to where it's it's
[59:35] just it's not daylight but yet it's so
[59:39] dark a dark time a Dark Age a dark
[59:44] moment a dark hour and here is a storm
[59:48] and let me just say this these ain't
[59:50] just any people on this water this ain't
[59:52] just another set of fishermen these are
[59:54] God's men this is God's elect this is
[59:57] the one that Jesus
[59:59] loves handpicked by Jesus
[1:00:03] himself the ones he loves and cares
[1:00:07] about and I'm want to tell you if Jesus
[1:00:09] loves you and he cares about you won't
[1:00:12] he watch over
[1:00:15] you I want you to notice where did this
[1:00:18] storm come from this is not Jesus
[1:00:22] testing their faith this is not Jesus
[1:00:25] trying them
[1:00:26] this is not Jesus testing them he's not
[1:00:29] trying to see how much Faith they got
[1:00:31] he's not trying to test them on how
[1:00:32] mature that they are but actually the
[1:00:34] prophet tells us the author of this
[1:00:37] storm is the Devil
[1:00:39] Himself amen and he notice what he's
[1:00:41] doing the prophet said he's taking
[1:00:43] advantage of the opportunity because the
[1:00:46] disciples didn't have Jesus in the
[1:00:49] boat amen he finally got him to a place
[1:00:54] where Jesus wasn't mide
[1:00:56] and Jesus wasn't in the ship and because
[1:00:59] Jesus is not there Satan sends this
[1:01:02] storm and he moves upon the Water to try
[1:01:05] to kill Jesus's
[1:01:08] elect oh I can't say it any better than
[1:01:11] that oh my you realize when Jesus is
[1:01:14] there the storms didn't work remember
[1:01:18] he'd already tried that a great storm to
[1:01:20] be able to sink the ship and they went
[1:01:22] and woke Jesus up ain't that a good
[1:01:24] thing to do and when they woke him up up
[1:01:26] Jesus come to the bow of the boat and he
[1:01:28] spoke to the storm that was trying to
[1:01:30] sink the
[1:01:32] ship but where's Jesus is at now these
[1:01:35] are men oh let me just say it like this
[1:01:38] so you can take and see it these are
[1:01:41] people that love Jesus chosen elected
[1:01:45] and Satan has caught them without Jesus
[1:01:48] being in the
[1:01:50] ship the disciples are crossing this
[1:01:53] water and brother said they left Jesus
[1:01:56] but I want to say this the only reason
[1:02:00] why they're Crossing this water is
[1:02:02] because Jesus constrain them to go the
[1:02:04] other side let me just say it they are
[1:02:07] not in the Fourth Watch of the night
[1:02:10] because they want it to be but Jesus is
[1:02:13] the one that directed them he
[1:02:15] constrained them he told them you must
[1:02:17] get in that boat and you must go out on
[1:02:19] the water and I want to say this they're
[1:02:21] not here by themselves they're
[1:02:23] commissioned by the Lord himself to
[1:02:26] where they're at to be in the boat to be
[1:02:28] crossing the water Jesus has and you're
[1:02:30] not here alone the reason you're in this
[1:02:32] age is God put you in this
[1:02:35] [Applause]
[1:02:40] day amen said when the waters got choppy
[1:02:45] brother said the first thing to come to
[1:02:46] the disciples is they got scared I can
[1:02:50] preach right there a minute we can't
[1:02:53] look down upon the disciples because
[1:02:56] we've done the same thing they have when
[1:02:58] Waters get rough fear comes
[1:03:01] around when things you can't explain and
[1:03:04] you don't know what's going on and your
[1:03:05] mind's running 100 m hour and you don't
[1:03:08] know the answer you know what wants to
[1:03:09] come around fear and the prophet said
[1:03:12] fear has a way to paralyze your
[1:03:15] face the prophet said fear Makes You
[1:03:19] Weary fear makes you
[1:03:22] wonder and fear makes you doubt
[1:03:27] and he says fear and faith cannot
[1:03:30] operate in the same ship in the same
[1:03:33] boat in the same heart at the same time
[1:03:37] come on somebody so Satan sends this
[1:03:40] storm across the sea and brother Ram
[1:03:43] told us not only did he have the ability
[1:03:46] to be able to zern people at the
[1:03:48] platform on what it happened but he can
[1:03:50] even discern what Satan said PL back in
[1:03:54] the days when the disciples was crossing
[1:03:55] in the water the prophet said in his ey
[1:03:58] 1961 when all hopes was gone and the
[1:04:01] little boat was pitched like a bottle
[1:04:03] stopper out there when 10,000
[1:04:06] Devils of the sea
[1:04:09] swore they swore that they would drown
[1:04:13] the disciples that night cuz they'd gone
[1:04:16] off without him listen now and That's
[1:04:20] what Satan says
[1:04:24] today so he takes takes that story from
[1:04:27] the Fourth Watch of the night and he
[1:04:29] brings that same mentality of the enemy
[1:04:32] 10,000 Devils they are swearing that
[1:04:35] they will drown you now notice the only
[1:04:39] reason Satan hates them is because of
[1:04:44] their
[1:04:44] Association because of their faith
[1:04:48] because of who they're following oh I'm
[1:04:49] preaching to somebody tonight because of
[1:04:52] who they're F because of the stand they
[1:04:54] made because of what they believe
[1:04:57] because they're following Jesus because
[1:04:59] they're standing with Jesus because they
[1:05:02] say Amen to what Jesus says Satan hates
[1:05:08] them they're a threat to
[1:05:10] hell they're upsetting his plan amen and
[1:05:14] let me just say this you who believe the
[1:05:16] word for this day you who stand for the
[1:05:19] word of this day you are a threat to the
[1:05:21] kingdom of hell and Satan will do
[1:05:24] everything he can try to stop you he'll
[1:05:27] do everything he can to try to stop me
[1:05:29] why you are a threat to his
[1:05:32] [Applause]
[1:05:33] plan he'll cause waves of sickness to
[1:05:36] come across your life he'll cause wave
[1:05:38] of discouragement to come across all
[1:05:40] kinds of Doubt storms of weariness
[1:05:44] storms of
[1:05:46] fear to do what to try to sink your
[1:05:52] ship the prophet says he knows if he can
[1:05:56] get the disciples to fear if he can
[1:05:59] shake them up enough to fear if he can
[1:06:01] stir them up enough to fear he knows
[1:06:04] that faith and fear cannot move in the
[1:06:06] same place and he knows that faith and
[1:06:08] fear cannot reside in the same place at
[1:06:11] the same time so what's he going to do
[1:06:15] catch him at a vulnerable
[1:06:18] moment oh let me preach right here catch
[1:06:21] you at a vulnerable moment when you're
[1:06:23] weak and you ain't been pray praying
[1:06:25] like you need to you ain't read your
[1:06:27] Bible like you need to maybe you're not
[1:06:30] going to church like you need to and
[1:06:32] when you don't go to church you get weak
[1:06:34] you get feeble if you don't eat natural
[1:06:37] food you get weak and you get feeble if
[1:06:40] you don't eat spiritual food you'll get
[1:06:42] weak you come on
[1:06:44] somebody so he wants to stir their minds
[1:06:48] to catch them weak catch them down catch
[1:06:51] them discouraged and he'll use any
[1:06:54] tactic that he can can he'll use any
[1:06:57] person that he can he'll use disease
[1:07:00] he'll use health problems he'll do
[1:07:01] everything to try to bring fear around
[1:07:04] your life to try and make you doubt the
[1:07:06] faith that God has put in
[1:07:08] you the prophet tells us he put a demon
[1:07:11] on every
[1:07:13] wave he put a demon on every every de
[1:07:16] every wave that was slapped had one goal
[1:07:18] one purpose put fear instill fear make
[1:07:22] fear come into them
[1:07:26] the prophet said he was blowing his
[1:07:29] poisonous breath across that sea and
[1:07:33] he'll do everything he can to sink your
[1:07:36] boat sink your life take your morals
[1:07:40] away take your Purity away take your
[1:07:43] confession of Faith away and make you
[1:07:45] feel so guilty under condemnation that
[1:07:48] you don't feel like that you can ever
[1:07:49] stand up and worship again and praise
[1:07:51] him again and love him again that's what
[1:07:53] Satan wants to do is sink your
[1:07:59] boat but I want to tell you something
[1:08:01] tonight let me tell you something the
[1:08:03] devil didn't know Jesus was coming I
[1:08:07] said Jesus was coming Not only was Jesus
[1:08:10] coming he was watching over his sons he
[1:08:13] was watching over his elect Jesus had
[1:08:16] his eye upon them they may have left
[1:08:19] Jesus but Jesus never left
[1:08:24] them her prop it tells us he climbed up
[1:08:27] to the high mountain oh think about
[1:08:29] after the death be and Resurrection he
[1:08:31] climbed up on high and he's been
[1:08:33] watching over you ever
[1:08:39] since what he didn't know is Jesus was
[1:08:43] watching every move oh I hear the
[1:08:46] prophet tell us he said that Jesus was
[1:08:48] not going to allow to get bad enough to
[1:08:51] where it can take them all the way down
[1:08:56] and in the Fourth Watch of the night
[1:08:59] when it looked like they're fixing to be
[1:09:02] dead the next wave could be it about
[1:09:05] that time the one that watches over you
[1:09:09] and the one that watches over me here he
[1:09:11] come walking over sickness here he come
[1:09:14] walking over doubt here he come walking
[1:09:16] over fear here he come walking over
[1:09:18] every wave every demon that was in that
[1:09:21] wave Jesus put his foot on top of it he
[1:09:24] come walking over over the waves he come
[1:09:26] walking over all the trouble he come
[1:09:28] walking past all the fear he come
[1:09:30] walking past everything that Satan was
[1:09:32] showing up here come Jesus right down to
[1:09:35] where they was at I want to tell you
[1:09:37] Jesus knows where you're at he knows
[1:09:40] what you're dealing with he knows what
[1:09:42] you're going
[1:09:44] through
[1:09:46] Glory he knows and he cares and he's
[1:09:51] watching he would only allow the waves
[1:09:54] to get so high right
[1:09:56] Hallelujah he would only allow the wind
[1:09:59] to how for so
[1:10:01] long and here's my message to you you
[1:10:04] can either sit in this
[1:10:08] boat or you can walk on the
[1:10:13] water as a matter of
[1:10:15] fact I can't think of nothing better
[1:10:18] than a whole church walking on
[1:10:20] water I can't think of nothing better
[1:10:23] than all these young people Walking On
[1:10:26] Water Mama walking on water daddy
[1:10:29] walking on water grandpa walking on
[1:10:31] water churches preachers deacons
[1:10:33] trustees everybody go walking on the
[1:10:36] white
[1:10:40] Air I think we need to look up and say
[1:10:43] Lord if that be you did me to come un
[1:10:49] thee you know why Peter said that
[1:10:52] because he realized it's safer walking
[1:10:54] with the Lord
[1:10:56] sir than it is sitting in the
[1:11:00] boat I want to walk on what you're
[1:11:02] walking on ain't that the way you feel I
[1:11:05] want to walk on what you walk on I want
[1:11:08] to overcome the way David overcome I
[1:11:10] want to overcome the way Samson overcome
[1:11:12] I want to walk on what other people sink
[1:11:18] in for it to
[1:11:20] happen we've got to have more than just
[1:11:24] human faith
[1:11:28] but we've got to have a perfect
[1:11:29] Faith watch our faith has got to arise
[1:11:36] to the level that God has given us the
[1:11:38] word at to where we can come to a
[1:11:41] perfect faith in so much that we stand
[1:11:45] up and we say Lord if that's
[1:11:49] you brother that's all Peter needed to
[1:11:52] hear that's said that's all he needed to
[1:11:54] hear
[1:11:55] now let me ask you what do you need to
[1:11:58] hear what do you need to hear what
[1:12:01] preacher what sermon what quote what
[1:12:05] what do you need to hear what after
[1:12:07] everything that God has given us and
[1:12:10] said over and over and week in and week
[1:12:12] out what do we need to
[1:12:16] hear well if I had this I'd be a better
[1:12:18] Christian that's a copout well if I had
[1:12:21] that I think I could do better that's a
[1:12:22] copout everything that we have needed
[1:12:25] has already been provided in the word of
[1:12:27] God and all we've got to do is take it
[1:12:29] and believe it and step out of the
[1:12:35] boat I want to tell you what I
[1:12:38] see it's one thing to set in the
[1:12:40] boat it's a complete different
[1:12:43] Revelation altoe when you step out of
[1:12:45] the
[1:12:46] boat can I tell you what I see I see
[1:12:50] people hunkered down in the
[1:12:53] boat and they're riding this thing out
[1:12:57] well if it lets up a little bit I'll
[1:12:58] stand up until then I've got White
[1:13:01] Knuckles and I'm holding on until the
[1:13:03] wind quits until the waves quit I'm
[1:13:05] going to tell you they're not going to
[1:13:06] stop I'm telling you they're not going
[1:13:08] to stop amen how can you walk on the
[1:13:11] water if you don't stand up and claim
[1:13:14] your god-given rights how can you walk
[1:13:16] on the water if you're looking around at
[1:13:18] everybody else and you're hunker down on
[1:13:20] the boat
[1:13:27] people think they're spiritual cuz they
[1:13:30] made it and sitting in the
[1:13:32] boat you go to church I go to church it
[1:13:35] don't take a spiritual person to sit in
[1:13:37] the
[1:13:40] church anybody can come to this building
[1:13:43] and sit on pews anybody can carry a
[1:13:46] Bible around anybody can carry message
[1:13:49] books around anybody can put a picture
[1:13:51] on their wall but it takes somebody who
[1:13:54] is serious with Jesus
[1:13:55] when the boat goes to Rocket and the
[1:13:57] waves go to move it it takes somebody
[1:13:59] that knows who they are and where
[1:14:01] they're standing at to stand up in the
[1:14:03] middle of the boat in the middle of
[1:14:05] trouble in the middle of aest in the
[1:14:06] middle of sickness stand up and say Lord
[1:14:09] if that be
[1:14:11] you B me to come into thee on the
[1:14:16] water
[1:14:18] why why do we think the safest place is
[1:14:23] hunkered in the boat
[1:14:25] because we put more faith in the
[1:14:30] boat than what we do Walking With
[1:14:34] Jesus I'm going to agree there's
[1:14:37] Securities in the
[1:14:39] boat there's
[1:14:41] ores there
[1:14:42] sales but here's the problem the ores
[1:14:45] are
[1:14:48] broke and the cells are
[1:14:51] broke but why is it that we hold on to
[1:14:54] Broken ores
[1:14:59] maybe I can mend the sail I'll sail us
[1:15:02] right on out of here there's certain
[1:15:04] Securities in the boat it's
[1:15:07] tangible it's built to
[1:15:09] float amen can I tell you one well
[1:15:13] Brother David has got me this
[1:15:16] far and what happens is we put more
[1:15:20] faith in material things than what we do
[1:15:23] walking withes
[1:15:26] Jesus but our faith is ordered of the
[1:15:29] Lord to go past temporal
[1:15:34] things I wonder what would the end of
[1:15:37] Matthew 14 read be read like had Peter
[1:15:40] not stood up in the boat that
[1:15:42] night what would your Bible read like I
[1:15:45] doubt this story would have made
[1:15:47] Matthew's account had amen somebody I
[1:15:51] wonder how's the end of your story going
[1:15:53] to be read how's the end of your book
[1:15:56] going to be read what's it going to be
[1:15:57] said about you is it going to be boat
[1:16:00] hugger is it going to be or hugger is it
[1:16:02] going to be saale hugger or is it going
[1:16:04] to be somebody in this church somebody
[1:16:06] in this youth meeting somebody in this
[1:16:08] place stood up and said Lord that looks
[1:16:10] like you that sounds like you I believe
[1:16:13] that you B me to come unto thee on the
[1:16:16] water lord I believe it l me it's got to
[1:16:19] be you if it ain't you it's got to be me
[1:16:22] somebody has got to walk on the white
[1:16:24] hour
[1:16:33] the safest place is not the boat the
[1:16:36] safest place ain't your comfort zone the
[1:16:38] safest place ain't Lea it ain't the
[1:16:41] church it's walking on the
[1:16:45] [Applause]
[1:16:48] water how many times have we got
[1:16:51] hunkered down the boat and that demon on
[1:16:54] that way wave comes up and slaps the
[1:16:57] side of that
[1:16:59] ship and you don't know what's going on
[1:17:02] cuz you got your head down and you got
[1:17:04] your eyes
[1:17:06] closed and you know what we usually do
[1:17:12] hope I ain't got no problem with hope
[1:17:15] but only hope only going to take you so
[1:17:17] far and faith has got to take you the
[1:17:19] rest of the
[1:17:21] way hunker down got our eyes closed
[1:17:26] hoping hoping the waves
[1:17:28] quit hoping the wind stops and all
[1:17:31] you're doing it's hanging on you're
[1:17:34] there along for the
[1:17:36] ride you're hoping it gets
[1:17:38] better but I'm going to say this I've
[1:17:42] been guilty of being hunkered in the
[1:17:43] boat
[1:17:45] myself if you be honest every one of us
[1:17:48] at times has enjoyed the Securities of
[1:17:50] the boat let's just be honest it's a lot
[1:17:53] easier sometimes
[1:17:56] it's a lot less embarrassing sometimes
[1:18:00] amen hopeing everything's going to be
[1:18:02] all right hoping that it's going to get
[1:18:04] better I'm preaching to somebody tonight
[1:18:06] we've got to have more than hope we need
[1:18:08] a faith a perfect Faith to stand up and
[1:18:11] to step out of the
[1:18:14] boat we get so much confidence in the
[1:18:18] boat I'll just be honest with you it
[1:18:20] amazes me what people do in the boat
[1:18:23] they put so much confidence in the boat
[1:18:25] they start bailing
[1:18:28] water and that's all fine and good but
[1:18:30] the problem is there's more trouble
[1:18:33] coming
[1:18:35] in than what there is being bailed
[1:18:39] out but because we believe the boat's
[1:18:41] the safest place we just start bailing
[1:18:43] water and with that mentality we get the
[1:18:46] mindset I can help
[1:18:51] myself I can save myself
[1:18:54] I can do this by myself all I got to do
[1:18:57] is just keep bailing this water and I
[1:18:59] want to tell you the next wave will put
[1:19:01] twice as much trouble twice as much
[1:19:03] sickness twice as much weariness and
[1:19:06] gloominess than what the first Bell of
[1:19:08] water you threw
[1:19:10] out it's going to take more than your
[1:19:13] abilities to save
[1:19:18] you if you don't get a hold of Jesus you
[1:19:20] may die sitting in that boat amen it's
[1:19:24] impossible to keep the boat afloat
[1:19:26] without
[1:19:28] faith let me tell you what I mean by
[1:19:30] that it's impossible to go in the
[1:19:32] Rapture without fa it's impossible to
[1:19:35] overcome this age without fa amen we
[1:19:39] must stand up and speak and say Lord if
[1:19:42] that be
[1:19:43] you the prophet said the ores are broke
[1:19:46] boats filling up with water cells is
[1:19:49] already broke and here broke and here
[1:19:51] they are hanging onto this boat I say
[1:19:55] there must be a young man a young woman
[1:19:58] a preacher there must be a people that's
[1:20:02] been prophesied about in this book
[1:20:04] that's going to stand up matter of fact
[1:20:07] I don't believe it's just going to be
[1:20:08] one I believe it's going to be a
[1:20:09] universal bride and it's time for the
[1:20:12] body of Christ to start walking on some
[1:20:14] things that others has sunk in it's time
[1:20:16] we let this Faith that's been building
[1:20:19] up sermon after sermon after sermon word
[1:20:22] after word allow that word to come to
[1:20:24] materialization and let it build up and
[1:20:27] put the word into action we can preach
[1:20:30] it but it must be put in
[1:20:36] action listen to me it's
[1:20:40] imperative that we get out of the boat
[1:20:43] right let me tell you about this age you
[1:20:46] can't stay
[1:20:49] here you can't stay here you realize the
[1:20:52] last vision of America was in craters
[1:20:55] and Ashes you can't stay
[1:20:58] here you cannot remain here you must
[1:21:02] have a faith you must arise and have
[1:21:05] faith to get out of this
[1:21:09] land the words ain't going to move you
[1:21:12] and the sail's not going to move you
[1:21:15] it's at that moment that everything
[1:21:17] looks like it's broken fell
[1:21:20] apart that Peter looks and sees somebody
[1:21:23] walking on water
[1:21:27] oh I can say it better than that surely
[1:21:29] it's in the darkest hour the darkest
[1:21:32] part of the night that they find out he
[1:21:35] ain't never left
[1:21:39] them it's where they start hearing where
[1:21:42] he said I'll be with you even in you
[1:21:46] hallelujah oh it's at that time those
[1:21:48] words are letting you know I'm here he's
[1:21:51] here he's here and you look and you see
[1:21:53] he's here
[1:21:56] it's during that time oh catch it now
[1:22:00] that Peter's eyes become
[1:22:02] illuminated to who is present at this
[1:22:06] time it's the darkest time but he sees
[1:22:09] him it's the darkest
[1:22:12] age but he sees him it's a time of
[1:22:16] trouble and his eyes come open and after
[1:22:19] he sees who it
[1:22:20] is that
[1:22:23] Revelation oh how can I say it that
[1:22:26] Revelation did something to Peter when
[1:22:30] he recognizes who it
[1:22:33] is when he recognizes who he is that did
[1:22:37] something to Peter to where it awakened
[1:22:41] something inside of Peter it went beyond
[1:22:44] fear it went beyond doubt it went beyond
[1:22:47] mental comprehension but something in
[1:22:50] him oh my it moves Peter into a sphere
[1:22:54] of
[1:22:55] faith that caus Peter to stand up and
[1:22:59] speak
[1:23:01] Hallelujah and this is where we're at
[1:23:04] right
[1:23:05] now faith has been restored by the
[1:23:08] message of the
[1:23:10] hour it's in this day that God is
[1:23:13] calling you and I to a higher realm let
[1:23:16] me say this there's a place that you can
[1:23:18] walk as a child of God there's a realm
[1:23:21] that you can walk in there's a place of
[1:23:23] faith where you can live at and abide at
[1:23:26] and walk in as a
[1:23:30] Believer we cannot sit in this boat and
[1:23:33] keep our eyes on the
[1:23:38] waves and here comes
[1:23:41] Jesus Jesus has done his part
[1:23:45] amen Jesus did his part he's been
[1:23:49] watching amen but now Peter's got to do
[1:23:53] his part in this story
[1:23:56] story well what's Peter got to do
[1:23:57] Brother David
[1:23:59] believe let me just say it simple
[1:24:02] only
[1:24:04] believe we need to let this word that's
[1:24:07] been restored by the ministry of Malachi
[1:24:09] 4 move us into action it's time that we
[1:24:14] stand up and start walking on the things
[1:24:16] that has troubled us and beset us and
[1:24:19] keeps us beat down amen I'm talking
[1:24:23] about going to the prayer with the same
[1:24:25] trouble and the same need week in and
[1:24:27] week out and week in and week out you at
[1:24:30] some time have got to stand up and put
[1:24:32] that under your feet and walk over
[1:24:34] what's been troubling
[1:24:41] you do you realize the storm moved Peter
[1:24:47] to
[1:24:49] speak hallelujah what an hour to be
[1:24:52] living to where Peter has got a voice in
[1:24:55] this thing he's got something to do he's
[1:24:57] got something to say and the storm the
[1:25:00] trouble the battle the water the waves
[1:25:02] that demon moved Peter to
[1:25:07] speak that's what we need tonight to get
[1:25:10] so fed up with bailing water that it
[1:25:13] moves our faith into a realm of sphere
[1:25:16] where brother said it sets your eyes
[1:25:18] into a dimension that's beyond sea taste
[1:25:20] feel smell and here it's called
[1:25:23] faith and it moves you to
[1:25:27] speech I like
[1:25:29] this because Jesus when Peter
[1:25:33] asks and Peter
[1:25:35] speaks Lord if that' be you let me tell
[1:25:39] you this Jesus did not remain
[1:25:43] quiet during the
[1:25:47] storm he didn't let him feel like he was
[1:25:49] all by
[1:25:50] himself but the moment Peter does his
[1:25:53] part Here Comes Jesus responding with
[1:25:56] the word he don't remain quiet in the
[1:25:59] middle of your troubled times he does
[1:26:01] not remain silent during the middle of
[1:26:03] Troubled Waters and it didn't take 50
[1:26:06] Scriptures it didn't take a hundred
[1:26:08] quotes it didn't take something pumped
[1:26:10] up it didn't say take something jumped
[1:26:13] up it didn't take a hot guitar it didn't
[1:26:16] take a hot set of drums preach with me
[1:26:17] somebody all it took was one word I want
[1:26:21] to say tonight all it takes is real
[1:26:24] genuine Faith behind one word of God and
[1:26:28] that one word can move you into action
[1:26:30] and to put you into action tonight so
[1:26:32] you can walk on the
[1:26:35] [Applause]
[1:26:37] water the word will you say we're in the
[1:26:40] world did Peter get the authority the
[1:26:42] word gave him
[1:26:44] Authority the present tense word of the
[1:26:47] hour give Peter the authority to walk on
[1:26:50] the water the present tense word anybody
[1:26:52] hear me the message of his hour the word
[1:26:56] of his day give him authority to walk on
[1:26:59] the
[1:27:02] water do you hear him
[1:27:06] tonight this is what I see this is what
[1:27:09] I see I see the boat tossing I'm not
[1:27:13] talking about inches I'm talking about
[1:27:16] feet 10 feet up 10 feet down 20 feet up
[1:27:20] 20 feet down I can see Peter
[1:27:24] stand up in that
[1:27:26] boat and I can see Peter take his
[1:27:34] foot that feels hard to
[1:27:38] me I can sing take that first step of
[1:27:42] faith and stick it over that boat and I
[1:27:45] want to say this the waves didn't stop
[1:27:47] when he tried stepping out the winds
[1:27:50] didn't stop when he tried stepping out
[1:27:52] if you think everything's going to stop
[1:27:53] around your life when you tried to start
[1:27:55] stepping out I want to tell you it'll
[1:27:57] probably blow harder than it was when
[1:27:59] you were sitting in the boat because now
[1:28:01] you're a real threat you've stood up and
[1:28:04] everybody has seen you and now you're
[1:28:05] going to step out you don't have one
[1:28:07] scriptural evidence you don't have one
[1:28:09] Vindication oh you've got his Divine
[1:28:11] Authority from the present tense word
[1:28:13] and Peter starts testing the water feels
[1:28:17] like a board to me amen if he would have
[1:28:20] thought in his mind well that's H2O and
[1:28:21] it's water how in the world am I
[1:28:23] supposed to walk on that water if Peter
[1:28:24] would have thought he'd never
[1:28:27] walked let me tell you what I mean by
[1:28:29] that you will not be able to figure this
[1:28:33] out if you can figure it out you don't
[1:28:35] even need Faith it's more than
[1:28:38] comprehension it's more than
[1:28:39] understanding it goes beyond it's a
[1:28:44] paradox you just do it because the word
[1:28:46] told you to do
[1:28:52] it but you know we said
[1:28:55] Jesus can do it but this is
[1:28:58] me oh I know it brother Bram was here I
[1:29:01] guarantee you I guarante brother R's
[1:29:03] here he can do
[1:29:04] it brother Donnie can do it brother Joe
[1:29:07] can do it but what about
[1:29:10] me and then we say wait a minute Brother
[1:29:12] David what if I try to step out of the
[1:29:15] boat and I sink you've already
[1:29:20] sunk I said with that mentality you've
[1:29:24] already sunk if Peter would have stopped
[1:29:27] and thought about it he would have never
[1:29:29] have gotten
[1:29:31] out always questions isn't it but no
[1:29:34] answers ain't that what these propers do
[1:29:37] give a bunch of questions but they ain't
[1:29:39] got no answers well what happens if I
[1:29:42] don't make the Rapture what happens if
[1:29:43] I'm Not Elected what if I'm not
[1:29:45] predestined what if I'm not a seat of
[1:29:47] God your faith has to be so anchored in
[1:29:50] the revelation of the hour that if
[1:29:52] nobody else in that boat
[1:29:57] that if nobody else in this church I
[1:29:59] don't well brother d is's a man of God I
[1:30:01] know but I'm going to tell you if I
[1:30:03] don't go he don't
[1:30:07] go
[1:30:08] amen let me tell you don't have more
[1:30:11] faith in a preacher than what You' got
[1:30:13] in the god that's on the inside of you
[1:30:16] that's
[1:30:17] right all I can tell you is move over
[1:30:19] I'm going
[1:30:21] with and here goes Peter Peter that boat
[1:30:24] bouncing around Peter's oh my can I
[1:30:26] imagine Peter looking down one moment
[1:30:27] he's right by the water and water's
[1:30:29] pouring over the edge and the next
[1:30:30] moment he's 20 foot high and he just
[1:30:33] finally stepped out of the
[1:30:35] boat there was no change in the storm no
[1:30:38] change in the water no change in the
[1:30:40] wind but God don't need to change the
[1:30:42] water and God don't need to change the
[1:30:45] wind God don't need to change the waves
[1:30:48] he needed to change
[1:30:52] Peter the bird pulled him into a
[1:30:55] dimension and it literally listen to
[1:30:57] this it literally caught up
[1:31:02] Peter you know what the word caught up
[1:31:04] is
[1:31:05] Rapture Peter got raptured out of the
[1:31:10] boat he was caught up above the trouble
[1:31:14] caught up how in the world can we take a
[1:31:16] body change unless we get caught up
[1:31:18] first caught up higher than the world
[1:31:20] caught up higher than sin caught up
[1:31:22] higher than how can we go on the rure
[1:31:24] unless we get caught up before the
[1:31:26] catching up amen amen we must be caught
[1:31:30] up before the catching
[1:31:32] up he's got to go beyond his feelings
[1:31:36] emotions fears abilities and allow it to
[1:31:39] pull him to the place to do something
[1:31:44] Supernatural in the presence of God
[1:31:47] don't you see your Bible is full of
[1:31:51] people like
[1:31:52] that the faith of Abraham that called
[1:31:56] those things which were
[1:31:57] not as though they
[1:31:59] were the faith that Samson had when he
[1:32:03] picked up a dry
[1:32:05] Jawbone and he killed a thousand
[1:32:07] Philistines the faith that David had his
[1:32:10] brother D he said when he killed a giant
[1:32:13] the faith that shamgar had when he
[1:32:15] killed Philistines was just an oxco that
[1:32:19] Authority dropped down on Peter and it
[1:32:23] lifts him up circumstances didn't matter
[1:32:27] the odds don't matter being outnumbered
[1:32:30] doesn't matter the size of the giant
[1:32:33] don't matter size of the Waves don't
[1:32:35] matter how hot the fire is doesn't
[1:32:39] matter because Faith knows no
[1:32:43] circumstance Faith doesn't even look at
[1:32:45] symptoms it looks to the Divine promise
[1:32:48] of God you realize if you could ever
[1:32:52] really catch what I'm preaching today
[1:32:54] it'll change your walk with God
[1:33:00] forever let me warn you you stand up in
[1:33:03] the boat you'll get the attention of
[1:33:06] everybody you stand up in your college
[1:33:08] dorm you're going to get the attention
[1:33:10] of
[1:33:13] everybody you stand up think about it
[1:33:15] everybody's going to be watching you
[1:33:17] everybody's going to be looking at you
[1:33:19] and you say you're a Believer you say
[1:33:22] you're sold out you say Anchored In
[1:33:24] Christ they're going to think you're
[1:33:26] crazy they're going to think you're a
[1:33:29] fanatic but the only problem is they
[1:33:32] didn't hear what you heard you heard
[1:33:34] that word say come right on Jesus must
[1:33:38] speak to you personally to come right on
[1:33:42] that's all right we've always been
[1:33:44] looked at strange ain't that the way
[1:33:45] denominations looked at you when you
[1:33:46] stepped up and stood up in their boat
[1:33:49] ain't that the way they looked at you
[1:33:50] when you took your name off of their
[1:33:52] book they always looked at you strange
[1:33:55] even people around this message will
[1:33:56] look at you strange well who do you
[1:33:58] think you are what do you think you're
[1:33:59] doing I've been around this thing for 45
[1:34:01] years what in the world are you doing
[1:34:02] well we've had this revival and that
[1:34:03] Revival and this revival who do you
[1:34:05] think you are I don't think I'm nobody
[1:34:06] but let me tell you I heard him say
[1:34:09] come I'm not better than somebody else I
[1:34:11] just want to tell you I heard him I said
[1:34:13] I heard him I heard what he
[1:34:19] said I'm afraid we miss it we know
[1:34:21] quotes we know scriptures we know seals
[1:34:24] we know Thunders we know pools but what
[1:34:27] good does all the mechanics do if
[1:34:29] there's not a
[1:34:30] facei to get us out of the boat let's
[1:34:34] buy our hearts tonight if you would
[1:34:36] every head bound every eye
[1:34:38] Clos I wonder what you're listening for
[1:34:41] tonight what are you listening for what
[1:34:43] are you trying to
[1:34:45] hear or have you just swap
[1:34:48] boats I'm afraid that's what many people
[1:34:51] has done they swap Baptist boats for
[1:34:54] message boats Catholic boats for message
[1:34:56] boats but God's got to have somebody to
[1:35:00] put their foot over and start walking
[1:35:04] out it ain't for you to figure out how
[1:35:06] it's all going to work what what am I
[1:35:09] going to do with my friends that ain't
[1:35:10] got nothing to do with you that's God's
[1:35:12] business that's just like you asking
[1:35:14] well how how in the world's God going to
[1:35:15] heal me that ain't none of my business
[1:35:17] that's God's business God delivers the
[1:35:19] way he wants to deliver God meets your
[1:35:21] need the way he wants to meet your need
[1:35:23] it ain't you trying to figure it out
[1:35:24] it's just standing up and stepping out
[1:35:28] of the boat did not Jesus tell us in his
[1:35:31] word that where I
[1:35:33] am you may be also what do I got to do
[1:35:37] just take him at his word just take and
[1:35:40] believe what he has said if you believe
[1:35:42] what he said you can step out without
[1:35:44] fear without doubt without dread and you
[1:35:48] can possess a walk of fa and walk in a
[1:35:51] roomm where all things are
[1:35:55] possible we cannot sit around listen to
[1:35:58] me young people you cannot sit
[1:36:01] around just hoping somebody else gets up
[1:36:04] and does it I say you as an individual
[1:36:07] must take the initiative to
[1:36:09] yourself that's the where we should be
[1:36:11] at Lord if there's going to be a Revival
[1:36:14] won't you go ahead and just start right
[1:36:16] here Lord if you want somebody to stand

[1:36:24] else Lord if you need somebody I want
[1:36:26] you to send me take the coal of fire and

[1:43:18] amen amen do you enjoy that tonight
[1:43:21] [Applause]
[1:43:29] I was just thinking there you know Jesus
[1:43:31] never told Peter to get out of the boat
[1:43:34] never told him
[1:43:35] to but there's something it's just like
[1:43:38] you tonight you might be stuck in
[1:43:40] something but if you have what the
[1:43:42] Christ in you that was out on them
[1:43:43] Waters eventually you're coming out of
[1:43:45] the boat you'll not stay in there and
[1:43:48] then what it really struck me was that
[1:43:50] Jesus didn't tell Peter Peter wait let
[1:43:51] me calm it down let me calm this water
[1:43:54] down you can sit at home your depression
[1:43:57] will never
[1:43:58] leave it'll never leave God will leave
[1:44:01] it just like it is till you step out on
[1:44:02] top of
[1:44:04] it there's a voice out in the middle of
[1:44:06] your depression that's saying come
[1:44:08] there's a voice in the middle of your
[1:44:10] anxiety that's telling you to
[1:44:11] come it's going to be there and you're
[1:44:14] sitting home and you won't go to church
[1:44:16] no more you won't go to youth stuff
[1:44:18] anymore because because all these
[1:44:20] battles that you're fighting these
[1:44:22] things that's in your life these setting
[1:44:23] things in your life and and you you
[1:44:25] think staying home is going to it's
[1:44:26] still there it's always going to be
[1:44:29] there until you step out on top of it
[1:44:32] when when when Jesus didn't make the
[1:44:34] water any smaller he didn't make Goliath
[1:44:36] any smaller for David he didn't make the
[1:44:39] Lion's little kitty cats for Daniel and
[1:44:42] he didn't put the fire out before the
[1:44:44] the Hebrew children went
[1:44:46] in but out in the middle of that there's
[1:44:48] a voice calling you but you have to be
[1:44:50] willing you have to have faith to stay
[1:44:52] step out on top of
[1:44:54] it that that that's my desire you know
[1:44:57] it's it's just you know we live in an
[1:44:58] age and as he was saying tonight you you
[1:45:01] young people are fighting battles that
[1:45:03] that we've never fought I can't imagine
[1:45:06] when I when I was at the police
[1:45:07] department dealt with juveniles suicide
[1:45:10] 12 year olds committing
[1:45:12] suicide because they couldn't cope with
[1:45:14] this age they don't they didn't have a
[1:45:17] Jesus out there telling them step out on
[1:45:18] the water you've got one tonight you've
[1:45:22] got one that said get out of the
[1:45:24] boat you can't just sit in the boat and
[1:45:26] read your Bible and hear sermon after
[1:45:28] sermon you we got people that are going
[1:45:30] to spend their eternal life the rest of
[1:45:32] their life sitting in a boat pressing
[1:45:34] play and going to
[1:45:36] hell there's a Jesus on the water amen
[1:45:40] it's time to get out of the boat that's
[1:45:42] my desire for you for the youth y'all
[1:45:44] are my heart you this is what me and
[1:45:47] brother Rob think about all the time is
[1:45:49] what we can do for you the best thing we
[1:45:52] can do for you is present Jesus to you
[1:45:55] and that's what we're trying to do not
[1:45:58] by some man up here by telling you about
[1:46:01] him he's on the water and he's standing
[1:46:03] out there just get out of the
[1:46:05] boat there's nothing to worry about
[1:46:08] you've got nothing to worry
[1:46:10] about just take what you heard tonight
[1:46:12] and put it in your
[1:46:14] heart you know it it takes faith brother
[1:46:16] brand said human Faith only goes so far
