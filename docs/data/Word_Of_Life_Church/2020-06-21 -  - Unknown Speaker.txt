message he brought last night being mindful to the Lord and and just minding the Lord for the darlin said as you heard he had no intention of bringing that message but how it ministered to her hearts and that message in that best spirit that was here last night well that spirit I feel it's still the same right here this morning we're so glad for that you can't you can't buy that you can't model it and bring it with you it's just it's there we thank God for it we're gonna look at her prayer request this morning we want to welcome all of you to the service wherever you would be streaming this

there are ones gathered around their computers around their tablets around their screens and we just ask that you just move into those homes and move into those hotel rooms move into those vehicles wherever they may be Oh God may be out under a tree somewhere father because they don't have a proper place as far as what we would say a building but Lord they've assembled together to hear from you and we just ask that you would just express yourself in a mighty way as you've never done before father and these requests of Prayer the testimonies that have gone forth Lord it's just a fraction quite frankly not even a fraction that we could probably even see it's so small of what we hold in our hand compared to those around the world father the needs that are coming up to you father our country is in trouble our world is in trouble Oh God and we need to hear from you right now father God and your people are calling upon you and just as it was with the children of Israel Lord when it was time to go Lord they were calling for you and you came for them Lord you came to deliver your people and so father that lets me know as we are here getting ready to take our exodus we aren't to be the ones calling you back so wherever that last seed is wherever that last person is that's to come that's to receive you Lord maybe it would be me that would say a kind word to a stranger maybe it would be someone in Africa maybe it'd be someone in Chile that would say a kind word to express love to passers-by or a family member a friend in need and that would be it it would sink it would catch and that would cause you to rise up from that seat Lord and be on your way and I can see the robes as they drop down around your ankles Oh God as you begin to make your way back father and may it be soon Father come soon Lord Jesus we need your father God we need you right now in this time and may the testimonies continue to come forth father for what you've done and it's in Jesus Christ's name

you today the name of the Lord Jesus there's not many of us here physically but I'll tell you one thing it feels like there's a whole host that you're with us in the presence of God and it's such an honor that we can be able to gather together here today we'll come read together three brothers who stand with him in Hebrews chapter five want to grade all of our fathers today and certainly wish them a Happy Father's Day trust it'll be a blessed day for you amen we counted a great great privilege to be able to worship the Lord in spirit and truth I'll tell you the presence of the Lord so wonderful last night sort of is so awesome brother Darrell just done a tremendous job so appreciate him following the leading of the Lord I'm told him after service I felt like with your many testimonies from that you know God's presence is coming in such a such a wonderful way we just pray for each to those of you that have been sick and afflicted by various things and we just know that God is mindful of us during this time that he's going to he's going to help us we'll read from Hebrews chapter 5 if you would verse 5 so also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest but he that said unto him thou art my son today have I begotten thee you say us also in another place thou art a priest forever after the order of melchizedek this word ever is a it's a strange word it's a Greek word of course this is the language it was written in but it it can mean eternal but it can also mean age lasting or it can also mean one age coupled with another age so the application of this word is very important whenever you read it miss read this again in verse six he also says also in another place thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek so we know the priesthood even actually of Melchizedek will come to a spot to where that it will fade into the eternal so it is a space of time it is a large one that it is a space of time verse seven who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death so Jesus is crying for a savior not because he's lost not because he's wretched but he's crying to be saved from death but if he got saved from death we would remain lost so the Savior cried for a savior but the Savior turned the Savior down that the Savior could fulfill the Savior's will and save all of us yeah with strong crying and tears and to him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared he feared let's pray together Lord Jesus thank you thank you so much for coming to this earth and allowing yourself to feel this type of feeling you are not lost as I said you are not a sinner but you did not want to die this type of death so your cried for a savior but the Savior could not answer your cries and you be able to fulfill your purpose and you were ok with that because you were ministered to and that angelic ministration helped you fulfill your will and line it up with Father's will so we know Lord this is one reason why you send ministering spirits to us they are both visible and invisible those beings which we sense around we cannot see them for the most part but we sense a charge stronger than electricity stronger than anything man would be able to make it's the charge from another realm and we're so grateful when you send them near us but we know also there are ministering angels that are on the earth call servants of God that yield themselves to you Lord and you speak through them to our hearts to encourage us when we're down so father we thank you we President to be mindful of all the needs of your people today Lord I'm thinking her brother wait aunt landlord you see this serger that he had to have and Lord it's affected his ability to swallow father we called our brother's name right now in the name of Jesus may the Spirit of God touch our brother Lord make him well may there be no lasting results of this Lord and our brother's life all the rest of the needs of your children speak to us today father from your great word we sent your here Lord in a mighty way we thank you Lord Jesus help me to get out of the way father I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you brothers you may be seated god bless your saints that are streaming today we're certainly long for the day when we can be back together again in the presence of the Lord but until that time arrives we believe the Lord understands well they are and he'll compensate for us and and help us let us look back if we can here to verse 5 this morning so also Christ glorified not himself to be made a high priest this is astounding to me the great position that the Lord Jesus took upon himself of course we know he had to in order to be a willing lamb to die for us but even in fulfilling the Father's will the Lord Jesus never assumed upon his fulfillment of that to ask Spirit God for such a glorified exalted position it helps me to realize that whenever we are looking for positions and we are desiring and wanting an element of God's glory to be shared upon our lives it makes you to understand why that the Prophet would tell us over and over again those who desire such a position most of the time are not qualified to be so but the Lord Jesus himself that not another human being or let me say it this way even an angelic being could say that they had done what he'd done yet he would not assume because of that obedience and fulfillment he would not assume to ascribe to the position of being High Priest on his own now he knew of course that this position was going to be his he actually quoted Psalms 110 in Matthew which alluded to the position of the order of Melchizedek but yet Paul catches the attitude of the resurrected glorified Christ that he never actually assumed or stepped into that position on his own so also Christ glorified not himself to be made a high priest but he that said unto Him thou art my son today have I begotten thee never remember the Lord Jesus was begotten in the womb of Mary to the Immaculate Conception or the virgin birth but actually this begotten here is not referring to that begotten in the womb but it was a begotten which took place after his resurrection because it involves the priesthood of Melchizedek now the Lord Jesus acted out he was a priest of course the woman touching the hem of his garment and he was touched by the feelings of the infirmities of the people but he actually never entered into the order of Melchizedek until he entered into the order of an endless life now the life of Jesus the human the body today that it started and it had a day that it could die is L right so this could not be then the fulfillment or the completion of the order of melchizedek until after his resurrection notice in verse six and he say us also in another place thou art a priest forever after the order of melchizedek so it represents the Messiah as being the high priests by the declaration of God now this is not a self assuming role and it's not something the Lord Jesus said I'll do it I'll do it let me do it let me do it but it was by the declaration of God and remember it was for the coming messianic Kingdom that he was going to be not only priests but king on the throne now this is something that no other man had been able to do except the ascribed position of Melchizedek himself now this is going to be when the priesthood of Melchizedek will actually come to a termination it will be when the kingdom of the Messiah will be turned back into the realm of the eternal now listen to me carefully that the Messianic Kingdom actually begins with the dispensation of the grace of God and it goes through the dispensation of the church Aegis comes over into the span of the or the great honeymoon which will be the great time in heaven but it also comes over into the Millennium reign and then it will end at the end of the millennial reign when time consummates and comes back into the realm of eternity once we move into eternity something not only happens to this earth and she gets her baptism of far the Holy Ghost but something also happens to the see annek Empire the Messianic Kingdom now remember as long as there are people that are being saved in the Gentile Church ages in the time of the Millennium there will be people that will be turning their lives over under the reign of the son of David in the messianic Empire and as long as that is going on then the administration of the Messiah under the order of Melchizedek will be needed but once all rebellion has been annihilated once all rebellion now think of it rebellion will still be in the hearts of some of those unregenerate people in the time of the millennium and when the millennium is over some of them will actually revolt against the Lord Jesus and His Saints in gorath odd bodies so the end of the kingdom cannot be turned over to the eternal until all rebellion has been brought in subjection now this is what happened of course in heaven that rebellion was brought down on the earth it happened in the heart of a first then it happened in the heart of Adam and then it's happened in the heart of every mortal every sense and until that rebellion has been annihilated there must be a channel a dispensation of grace by which God can deal was man oh he is so great he is so phenomenal and so wonderful I'm sure that we don't understand one inkling about the greatness of how big and wonderful that our God is but looking at it in this way as long as God is dealing with man on the earth through the act of rebellion God had to condon sin to a level of administration of grace to keep from annihilating the entirety of the human race think of it to this very day and our state of mortality in our human bodies we could not be allowed to come into the realm of the eternal because of our mistakes our shortcomings are inherited weaknesses and all that we are we still need I know there's some of the message that Fela they don't need him on the throne of God they don't need him as a mercy seat it shows how ignorant they really are of their self and how ignorant they are of the Bible we will need him as long as we are mortals every day we live on this earth now what you notice is how that Paul catches determination of the Messianic Kingdom and how it rolls over into the kingdom of the eternal in first Corinthians chapter 15 verse 24 then cometh the end now listen they in so before it can roll back from this little loop this the hickey will pull back up into the circle of eternity again there must be a termination so in the beginning the prophet said was when time began so there must be an end of time now we are in the end time right and we believe at the end of all things is at hand but yet the end of time will actually not take place until I to the Millennium and the white throne judgment and then when all of this terminates then God will actually end time and time will cease to exist so the loop will be pulled back up into the circle and all the redeemable subjects of God will be fully clothed and their bodies of immortality the grace of God the spilled over into the book of life and those ever able to receive them will also be given eternal life and then the messianic Empire of the Lord Jesus which is the humanity of God will now have terminated because it completely stood between fallen man and the eternal and once the end absolutely consummates then there will be no longer the need of a mediator all praise God we still will need that humanity in the Millennium for those who are not yet converted praise God now what's this Paul said then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God now here we're talking about the Lord Jesus now when I talk about two gods and we're not talking about actually two separate people but the Lord Jesus is only our visible extension of the invisible God it is the part of God that comes descends to the level of man that will allow the Justice of God to reveal himself to man through this channel of grace called the Lord Jesus but yet he's identified here under the Messiah ruler and he says then cometh sayin when he the Lord Jesus so had delivered up the kingdom to God even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and all power now whatever this has happened at the end of the millennium then the Lord Jesus the humanity of God will now move into this back into this realm of the eternal so the mediatorial kingdom that has been established for several thousand years will have reached its accomplishment and fulfillment with the fullness of human Redemption the fullness of human Redemption also includes Botany life animal life the cellular system the stars the universe the earth everything exactly as it will be roll back to the setting of eternity what's eternity comes into view then the mediatorial work of the Messiah will have completed and consummated all hallelujah notices and Paul says in verse 25 for he must reign till he put all enemies under his feet so that is rebellion that is stubbornness that is sickness but it also includes death so it is the father who puts all enemies under the subjection of his own son or his own humanity notice in Matthew 22 44 the Lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footstool now notice when this is completed then the son the humanity the Word made flesh the body then that will be able to revert the entirety of the kingdom now notice it's not that Jesus the second person it's gonna be like a lieutenant or he's gonna be this guy in second command or no it simply moves under the shadow of the Father God everything that has been fully redeemed will now be able to see father God in an expression of his glory that we was not even be able to see in the rapture that we was not even able to see in the Millenium how the limbs gonna be a wonderful time but father will still not be on the earth in the fullness of his attribute yet in the Millennium it is the honeymoon right and then after time ends we will go back into the eternal Kingdom praise God notice what will happen then the Son of God the humanity the Jesus quoting this the Lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footstool so when this is done the Lord Jesus of course in Revelation 1117 saying we give these Saints Oh Lord God Almighty which art and wast and art to come because thou hast taken to thee thy great power and his reign now notice so this was something that was delegated and given to the sonship of God this was given to the humanity of God and he has now put his foot on the footstool of every enemy they have become under him sickness and sorrow and death and suffering they have become as simply a footstool under his feet notice in verse 26 the last enemy that shall be destroyed is dead so now you'll be looking at after the white throne judgment and then we move into the face of the eternal now this all comes under the administration of the Messianic Kingdom I remember God absolutely absolutely the Lord Jesus could not be his own father but God could become his own son and he did so Jesus was the visibility of the invisible God he was the very heart of God the very Justice of God the fullness of God the wrath of God could never come down on the earth and walk among sinful men he would annihilate every one of them the Lord God the eternal could not be here among us this morning because of our mortality because of our failures our faults amen because of our mistakes he could not deal with that he could not stand it his justice would require death but what did he do he projected something out of his own being hallelujah he projected something out of his own being which was his own humanity he could become a human he could understand if he could become a human he could relate if he could become a human he could have mercy and such an extreme he could never have in the Old Testament as a pillar of fire so he must convince him to be a human and he will remain a glorified human through eternity Oh hallelujah notice this in verse 27 for he has put all things under his feet but what he says all things are put under him it is manifest that he is excepted which did put all things under him so the administration of the Kingdom of grace now listen carefully so you don't misunderstand me we'll finally be closed no more grace no more mercy no more walking by faith we will live by sight by the power of God we will no longer had to sell I know he's here I know it I can feel him I came feeling about but I know he loves me I know he does I take his word for it No we'll see you will see him so the door of grace and this phase of scripture cannot be open at the same time to see this ruler to seeing him in this form of his person it means that grace has brought us to this platform but as long as the door of grace is open it shows is a need of immediate sort it shows there are people that have not yet arrived into the states of perfection but when all the enemies have been made subject to the Lord Jesus then the Lord Jesus to humanity will be able to step back under the Father strong again under the Shekinah under that great glory and it will testify that he has been accepted grace is no longer needed mercy is no longer needed pardon is no longer needed mediatory is no longer needed he has successfully brought every attribute back into the realm of eternity and will be therefore beholding the glory of the eternal you see there is a great distinction became between the kingdom of grace and the kingdom of glory we've never seen that yet we're under the kingdom of grace is it any wonder that the prophet calls it even for our body change rapturing grace let's face the facts if we leave this world and a body changed it'll be rapture and grace it ain't cause your rapturing perfect and him because your rapturing absolutes and your this and that it will be Grace it gets us out of here it's grace it saved us it was grace this sanctified us it was grace they give us the Holy Ghost it's grace this help on sook it's great to selfless every day of my life it will be grace the consummation of grace leading to our new body will be what rapture and grace I've said that the marriage supper of the Lamb the grace of God the grace of God but one day the grace of God will give way and the door will open up to the kingdom of glory no longer will I have to stand there but my head bow because of my humanity no longer laughter bow Oh God forgive me oh god I'm sorry Oh God forgive me I will never pray another prayer forgiveness I will never say Lord I'm sorry lord please forgive my brothers lord please forgive my sister but I will I've been completed by the Messiah himself and when he has completed me when he has completed you and the cycle of redemption has been consummated the kingdom of Grace will pull itself into the kingdom of glory beyond abuse even many of our songs of heaven are still written in the dispensation of the perception of the gospel of grace and the kingdom of grace and in our minds our suppose we struggle of trying to think how it will be in the kingdom of glory without the dispensation of grace still being there all I was lost Lord you say man Lord I'm not worthy please don't misunderstand me one day you won't take that weight no more because the Lord Jesus would have so completed his work he will no longer be immediate under the Messianic kingdom don't offend the son of man be coming Messiah literally he will enter in under the father's glory what's this in verse 28 Paul said when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the word the son also himself be subject and I'm getting in your mind yours this young guy he's gonna be under this old man no it's simply a Picasso which is a referring or a changing of the order praise God it is a changing of the order or an arrangement but what's multiple things are put together and this piano with the strings and things that are on it one note Lupo tousle one notes fine boy when you put them others in there what does it do it makes it not only a note but a chord and then the chord comes together and it makes another chord and another chord and a song and a melody and so on and so on and whenever the Lord God moves into this final stage and this is what we will deal with for eternity when we will no longer in our minds under the grace dispensation oh I was lost I was lost some onwards they do you actually think you could enjoy heaven going around with that in your mind walking around you're going to heaven today of how I'm not worthy going up to the city I'm not worthy you'll never have that thought again you're never thought you'll never have that before you again under the Messiah himself moving into the becoming subject under the glory of God proves my friends it's not a humiliation to our Lord Jesus it is an absent of his position and a complete fulfillment of what the humanity of God was able to do the humanity of God was the only thing that could fulfill this the locals could not do it the fullness of the attribute of God in spirit form could not do it God must become a human notice is also he himself must be subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all you know Jesus will continue to reign on the earth under the glory Chicana of the Father through eternity because you see God is not a man only in Christ so there won't be two Thrones the three friends John never looked up and said I saw three Thrones and ever John said I saw one throne and one that said on it so here ii ah will hang over the son a mirth and what is this call Peter called it the coming of the day of God air berg let me just tell our animators smart he can rant and rave he can do all he wants to the disease and sickness and all kinds of things but his days are numbered let me just tell them Satan your kingdom is coming down cannot say it will not stand but the coming of the day of God is at hand my brother's system notice is in the day of God John saw peculiar saying revelation 21 22 and I saw no temple therein for the Lord God Almighty and the RAM notice are not the temples but the temple so Jesus is the body the father is the Chicana a Solomon's Temple was the house and the father was the glory the temple he was actually building the humanity and type of the Lord Jesus and it was the father that entered inside that temple and that temple was throw down and destroy and so did God allow his humanity to be tore down but he said I will not leave your soul and and your body will not corrupt why because I'm gonna live in that for eternity hallelujah so John looks around and being a Jew is used to attempt least you still play what place to worship and he said I didn't see no place of worship but he said the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the temple there so they one mention of him one man sent over there but it's the Lord God Almighty and the lamb so the father is hanging over his body help me Jesus what's this in future home city was the throne on top revelation 21:23 they need no light for the lamb and the Lord God is a lie down see the Lord God is that pillar of fire that followed the chiller missile through the wilderness and he is ascended upon the throne in that perfect Kingdom the kingdom that Jesus is going to surrender to the father that God may be all and in all Jesus sets upon his throne here as our Joseph and the king is that light that will be on Mount Zion and his holy light will flood the entire city hallelujah question-answer 64 on top Mount Zion will set the land and the city will need no right for the lamb is the light thereof will be the father which is the Lucas God the great light the eternal light that will shine just above the food and Jesus will not be on his father stone he'll be on his song and the father well what's the father and son will be one a while there yes speaking I'll answer before they can think I'm thinking for them that's right and Jesus who commits a perfect perfect age to a perfect Living God that he has redeemed and give over to the father as that right will turn to God the Father which is spirit not man spirit all nature of goodness gathered together that's gone praise God so let's look a little bit now at the order of Melchizedek Hebrews 566 also in another place our two priest forever after the order of Melchizedek Genesis 4:17 gives us the appearance of Melchizedek and the king of Sodom went out to meet him speaking of Abram after his return from the southern kettle eomer and of the kings that were with him at the valley of shaveh which is the King's Dale and Melchizedek king of Salem so here we have a tale of two kings Abraham goes and fights he is victorious the king of Sodom whose name was Berra de ra which means gifts he is the king of Sodom which means burning so he meets Abram another King per se - I'm Melchizedek king of Salem I hope you understand your life's journey is made up of meeting these two same kings and type Beryl represents Sodom the world everything the tries to pull you away from the divine providence of the king of Salem he meets April oh my we'll find out what he offered him your Abram is now faced after this great victory and God had done a great thing for him now here comes Vera and he offers him gifts now of course Abraham had went out there and it rescued lot and the other people of Sodom and the kings of kettle a homer and the other kings had stolen the goods for Sodom and he comes back and he wants to make a deal with Abram but Abram all my he had already met Melchizedek Hamer how did this man know when he met this being that looked like a human hallelujah he broad and wide and he served to Abraham Bera offered abraham wealth goods that abraham refused his gifts but he accepted Melchizedek's he acknowledged his dependence on the king of Salem but he displayed his independence from the king of Sodom I don't need your goods I don't need your world I don't need what you've got to offer lemma can we say that today to the devil can we say to Satan and all his Laodicean riches and all the things that he's got we don't need you we don't want you we want nothing to do with you were only here until we're taken out of here but boy we turn the other way to the king of haru salaam and we say to him we need you every day every hour we can't even walk without you in this life we are totally dependent on you i realize our nation is get more and more and more on my independent from god and it is our down casting away from his presence by doing so i will be celebrating him dependence in a few weeks and relative majority of the american people are in the worst slavery they've ever been it's a slavery of sin a slavery of sin and yet many of them go to church and say they love god and they're worse off than they've ever been in their life but we say to him we need you we love you we want your words tell us what to do and we'll do it Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine now what you notice from this prophetic stage of the implication of Melchizedek life of the typology of our Lord Jesus this is why I say cannot enter into the fullness of the Melchizedek Priesthood until after his resurrection because Melchizedek offers to Abraham the memorials of the sacrifice sacrifice this is why we take communion I can't wait to hang I'll do it again Katie this is why we're not coming up with a bloody lamb the Lord Jesus is not offering himself every day before the presence of God he did that once he was so convinced it would be successful he gave them the elements of the communion before he ever died on the cross said boys go ahead and learn how to do this because what I'm gonna do is gonna work if it'd been like us without twins they give me a few years they let me see how this is gonna work and then y'all see if you can remember I said not tell what I want you to do let's go ahead let me give you a type right now because this is going to work it's going to be this is why brother sister we don't come and we don't bring blood all over our hands and all and the presence of God but when we come up here each one in our turn and we take that little piece of bread and we press that little tiny cup to lift what is it we are testifying our Lord's work was a success because we are taking this and memorial what he does now cancer offered to the fruit of a finished work don't you understand it proved that both Melchizedek and abraham believed in Redemption the communion had never been instituted but Melchizedek instituted communion so your sets Melchizedek in a human body and he looks at his disciples and said I have long was a great desire to read this supper with you take eat this is my body drink for the assister cup of the New Testament in my blood which is shed for you as often as you drink this think of me forget a memorial and here comes Melchizedek to a breath wine and bread bear ursus here you can have souls you can have women you're gonna have money you get a popularity nut oils come on down and move down with your nephew he's living a compromised life come on down and then compromise Abraham said I refuse I am NOT a compromiser I don't want your money I don't want you else I don't want nothing you've got because if I receive the gifts of beara I will wind up in the destiny of beara which is fire of Sun but if I take communion with Melchizedek I get to live in Melchizedek stamen if I father no cares if I get one better down the power of an endless life this is the order of Melchizedek is why Jesus the man could not have entered into the fullness of the power of an endless life of Milcah so he had to give his life but after race with the dead he could move into the full administration of the order of Melchizedek said I am he but I'm alive forevermore the Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the Most High God El Elyon enroute now back to Hebron Abram meets the two games one offers him things that will appeal to the flesh that they ride it around him what a great man you only had 318 men how did you get it boy you must be a military genius what we could do with you or if you just take care of talent in your ability and your singing and your music and your preaching and so on and join with us come on over and join with us and join with you and burn with you no thank him I said no saint I'd read a little rather live over here under the oak and the plains of Mamre and have visitations from God from time to time they may not be every day they may not be a song to this honor but I'd rather live over here by myself if I have to and know that memory is where God came down to see me namely is where he met me not down on the Vale of the Kings I don't want your wealth Bella but I'll take what you have Melchizedek you imagine a bear of us still hanging around with a lawyer when Melchizedek came up and it gives him breath and why ourselves carisi he's crazy look what I gave look what I offer and he turned it down for a piece of stimulation by revelation [Applause] everything I reject you off I don't want you to say you made me rich I won't even take a shoestring but I'll take what you've got king of Salem he's God oh you imagine as he looked at him he'd heard this voice for years and years but one day the voice was made of human I'd love to see his face when you heard that voice the first time he might I had all the garb of a king or a priest or the mixture of both we don't know notice this now milk acidic he was the king of Salem and priest of the Most High God this first forbidden guest was forbidden this is not even allowed on the era of the kings this is not allowed in the era of David or Solomon erase' or none of the rest of the kings how could this person dare merge both of these great offices into one human body who right now felt like English ain't good enough to express the way I feel who was it the prefigure of the Lord Jesus what happened to lot laud accept that the gifts the positions the honor the dignity of Bella and had it not been for the bride that asks for mercy for his sorry had it had been burned up coz think about it in reality that's what he deserved he was a compromiser so don't give up on your children don't give up on your husband your wife God won't make them bride cause you asked won't it but who knows God may let them be there of course your bride and God God here in your prayer you have to put them in a premature gray if you look at me weird if you want to I'd rather the same and a premature grave and saved then live 150 years and be lost that's exactly right so keep praying for all they may never be the kalam of you are but keep praying for neighbour have God may honor your prayer but Melchizedek means king of righteousness and Salem means peace so he's two kings king of righteousness and king of peace so you take his communion guess what becomes yours righteousness and peace as our brother so beautiful expressed when the world is going insane and it's going to get worse it's going to get worse but come and take communion with Melchizedek we can have peace in the midst of the storm we have peace on all the rest of the world don't know what in the world to do don't you see even as it was an Abraham's day so is it an hour day because the Lord Jesus the king of righteousness the Lord Jesus the king out peace has given us of his own furniture and obvious own nature and say eat of me children drink of me and this will be your life I promise you you will be as righteous before the eternal do we believe that if we enter into this government we always sinless God and we have peace going that way notice this and Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the Most High God so mechanic was man priest King man glory man priest and King don't Sakurai's 6:12 speak unto him saying thus speaketh the Lord of Hosts say behold a man whose name is the branch he shall grow up out of his place he shall build the temple of the Lord you know this is messianic this is the Lord Jesus even he shall build the temple of the Lord and he shall bear the glory the Father over the son and shall sit and rule upon his phone and he shall be a priest upon his own on a council of peace shall be between them both priesthood and kingship how is it brought between the two that the justice of kingship can be honored how can the justice of kingship and the Justice of God ever be left how can it ever be led all my years the kingship of God the holy righteous justice of God and your over here is the merciful priest I can never be mad in the body of the Lord Jesus hallelujah those wipeouts offices can merge in the temple of God we shall build the temple of the Lord and his name is called the branch he said through you and you will be my branch Chiefs as I was the father frenzy understand never saw what happened to us sure I start the office of high priest it's not just the Lord Jesus hearing you when you pray and he's there all God forgives him Oh God forgive them don't shine a sound the office of high priest he's also sending his gifted men into the earth and the high priest being touched was what you're going through and it gives inspiration to a gifted man of God which has a portion of himself it was the high priest ministering to us I slept through his gift and people say all the High Priestesses start happening is that Evan yes but his presence is here on earth and he's touched by the feelings of our infirmities and when we're down and we're weary and we don't know what to do good we're not promised another one to stand and turn his back to the audience but we are promised gifts of the high priest so the high priest takes that gift and inspires you know maybe from a very simple thought and gives birth to life changing life changing things that happen and what was if the high priest heard somebody's prayer the high priest saw somebody in a sleepless night turning and tossing oh god I need help Oh God peace all God and the high priest took a ministerial gift and channeled himself though she should have said if a man of God can get out of the way toship set his preaching to you don't shut up said what you're setting under the ministry of the high priests remember the Book of Numbers who never got tell Moses tell the priest to put my name on the people the Lord bless thee and the Lord be with thee and the Lord make his face to shine upon thee the Lord make his countenance this is what they were supposed to say and by saying this they were putting the name of the Lord on the people don't you see I'm true anointed men of God preached the word they're speaking the name of God the reputation of God the character of God they're placing that on your mind your heart your soul and you're merging under the administration of the high priest which is so mindful of fortune friends who bet he who bet he could have a man to preach something that you talked about before church he could lay on us injured men something that would be so phenomenal only he could do such a thing Lord Jesus notice this ministry of Melchizedek as it comes back on our Lord after his resurrection Oh watch how that he reveals himself to him under this name in Genesis 14 18 Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine it was the priest of the Most High God El Elyon which simply means the highest this is the first revelation of this name in the Canon of Scripture and was revealed after this servant had come through one of the hardest battles of his life this is the first time Abram has ever heard this name and who put it on him the ministry of the high priest would you notice this he meets this king of Sodom immediately he takes this new name to himself Genesis 14 19 a bush him and said blessed be Abram of the Most High God possessor of Hamelin sinner so notice the Ministry of high priest he wasn't sent to bless everybody but is sent to blessing those people that wouldn't give you a dime for though every sermon I've ever preached there's people that would not walk across the street to hear brother Daryl brother Joel or some of these I don't get nothing out of all they say what in the world are they talking about well I face the fact a long time ago sent everybody but if I can be sent to Abram and bless them I'm on a blessing this is part of who I am I'm here to bless the saints of God but your ministry don't bless me well maybe if God don't bless you sir to me Oh bless you through somebody else I want to bless those I'm not called to bless everybody in the bride I'm not called to pasture everybody in the bride praise the Lord but I want to bless those that I'm called to bless don't you and he must him Melchizedek now blessed Abram because this is part of his position glory to God and he said must be Abram of the Most High God and then he calls God who possessor of heavens and earth and blessed be the Most High God which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hands and he gave him ties now it was not remember Melchizedek pain ties to Abraham but Abraham ping ties to God I mean and while Abraham handed over the ties the words of God leave in his body God said I attribute you having if God could attribute Levi to paying tires at Abram you won't argue about that that's the Bible with the Lord somehow God made us to him after Abram says by the power of the Most High God I want nothing of your stardom now he had just heard this name but it had been put on him and in him and it become a part of the law so he's saying what milk has it except he had never heard this before that he was part of the Most High God I'd say he had a spell I am part of the most I am part of the Most High but I don't know why do you preach so much about the bottom part of him cause I wanted you to get it I want you to realize more than a monitor a part of the most under the old glory to God under the order of melchizedek I'm called to tell you you were more than a human a part of the Most High call notice to never Abraham rescinds the wealth of Sodom in chapter 14 the very next verse chapter 15 verse 1 after these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and my exceeding great this was not before he made his choice but after think of it our journey that begins so many many years ago with many of us when we had to refuse the kingdom we were born in we were born in the kingdom of beara and the kingdom of Sodom lost unregenerate but the Eagle scream come over us we've recognized the voice of Melchizedek but we're still making choices a lot to preach on this sometime the tale of two keys we're still making the choices because these two kings or now they don't know I'm us bearer we know a mess Satan he was the one anointing there he was the one that anointed him to say words that may be pulled on April's flesh God would not make him shoes he must choose but actually choose his brother Joe I did a battle to communion then God now says the word of the Lord come to Abram in a vision I am by great reward fear not Abram I am thy shield I am thy shield and my exceeding great let me close with this whose male character has 95 now the true revelation of Melchizedek comes into view what he was God the word before he became flesh God the word cuz he had to be no one else could be a mortal like you I father and mother you did to Jesus had father and mother but this man had no father or had no mother Jesus at a time he started this man did Jesus gave his life this man could because it was life it's the self same man all the time I hope God reveals it to you the self same person all the time notice his title king of righteousness now he'd be r72 king of righteousness came apiece his two kings watch Hebrews 72 king of righteousness also king of peace he's two kings there now since he has come in the flesh and received up his body in Revelation 21 16 he's called the King of Kings he's all three of them together King god-kings the Alpha knee King Jesus God don't you understand he was king God and eternal that's what they tell what he the king can he be coming to a tangible part they offer me and let it be stuck down down another attribute of God into the humanity King God keeps the offering King Jesus it's all met to suck soul body spirit all comes to make one I've got a soul a body in a spirit but I'm only one person King God Kings theophany King Jesus all meats and were the human temple called the Lord Jesus but God created this human temple in the realm of mortality and Jesus birthday now this is very strange because they don't have one nail you understand one day your birthdays will stop Alleluia older I get the less I like a mini half there Jesus that is in heaven no longer has a birthday because God changed that body into the realm of eternity and you cannot say about that body now it was born on a certain day one day mortality will be taken from yours birthdays will stop anniversaries will stop old age parties will stop nursing home care will stop when God will take your body into the Messianic Kingdom of eternal also he is the father he is the father which was the first Son and Holy Ghost the spirit king righteous the spirit attribute theophany king of peace theophany in first King of Kings same person gonna read just one more brothers that was look a Tesla but I know we've looked at this but I'm a call to priest after the order of melchizedek and I feel I've got to put his name now we see the attribute sons of his spirit have not yet entered into the word form body but a theophany this body is subject to the word and earnest waiting for the earnest change of the body now the difference between him and you as a son he was at the beginning the word Animorph a body he came in and lived in that in the person of Melchizedek so it was who Jesus was going to be before he becomes eases it was who Jesus was going to become to be before it becomes Jesus he become Melchizedek before it becomes Jesus well Hallows then Rider we never heard it because he became Jesus Christ Melchizedek was the priests but he became Jesus Christ no can you imagine him going straight from Melchizedek they attribute the Lord Jesus and the very next slide is about you now you bypass that but in that form he knowed all things and you never been able to know all things you come like Adam like me you become from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted but when this life is finished here if this others have enough will be this all will have one waiting that's where we go that is word then we can look back and see what we've done now we don't understand we have never become the word we'll just become the freshman oh but I love this but clearly it makes it clear you'll never be the word unless you will so thought at the beginning that proves oh my goodness that proves the predestination of God you can't be the word unless you're a salt you had to be in the thinking first but you see in order to stand temptation you had to bypass the theophany you had to come down here and flesh to be tempted by sin and then if you stand all the father's give them it will come to me and I raise him on the last day see you had to be first and then you see he come right down the regular line from attribute before the foundation of the world his name is from the Lamb's Book of Life then from that he become the word that's the awfully that could appear disappear then he become flesh return back again resurrected that same body and a glorified condition but you so do you all sink and you this listening to me do you think he's actually talking to a part of us when he's making these personal references but you is he speaking to angelic realms or is he speaking to humans there was something in them that's beyond what they see and understand but you bypassed the theophany and become flesh man so see notice he separates you from your theophany but he also separates you from your flesh man you are not the flesh prism that holds you you are someone else to be tempted by Satan and if this earth the Tabernacles dissolved we have one-way lists and brothers we have listened we have not yet the bodies of the look when this body receives the Spirit of God the immortal life inside of you it throws this body and subjection to God hallelujah he their spawn of God does not commit sin he cannot sin Romans 8:1 there's therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit there you are see that throws your body subject you don't have to say well if I could just quit drinking get in Christ and it's all gone see because your body is subject to the spirit it's no more subject for the things of the world we don't have the power to say to berra i don't want what you offer because this does come on we're born in it we're still corrupt I'm not I'm at this right here but the power of Melchizedek living in our soul can say to berra and all his kingdom take your Sodom take your gifts take your popularity your pride your arrogance so on and so on and take it I don't see the end of you bearer and that's not who I am praise God oh praise the Lord oh how appreciate it today let's bow our heads together Lord Jesus Lord what a blessed wicked we've had Lord house thank you for making that's so real to me early this morning but what happened last night here in this service was the administration of the high priest Father God you're not just there in heaven when we're sick and afflicted and weary and down and going through things and you sent our late I relate I can understand but Lord even aus of the ministry if people can only see your ministry is still ongoing your ministry is still working today through the Ministry of God come in as you are feeling the needs of your people and the infirmities of your people and you'll place on their hearts and sometimes against their better judgment they don't understand why it may not make no sense to him or may seem so simple to him or whatever but it's the needs of the children of God calling on their high priest oh jesus oh Jesus help me Lord if you just speak to me Lord if you just give me something you look place it on a man of God's heart and he thinks oh my goodness oh my goodness brother Daryl told me

just about at his breaking point but he streamed in on a Saturday night service and you the high priest had me to say things that was exactly what that brother needed so who should I follow people criticizers accusers or you I think I'll choose Melchizedek we worship your Lord God we're so glad to be part of the city of Jerusalem the city of the Great King we want none of Barris gifts or the burning of Sodom we want the gift of the Holy Ghost from Melchizedek and the burning out of sin out of our lives with of your father oh thank you let's just worship Oh God thank you Father thank you
