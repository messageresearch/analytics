It's wonderful to talk about history and talk about what people didn't know. But I'm so glad that we know today. &gt;&gt; He's not the second person of a godhead, &gt;&gt; but he's actually the godhead made manifest. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Well, I don't know about you, it seems like it's been forever since we've been in church. &gt;&gt; How How can one week be so long by just not having church on Wednesday? &gt;&gt; Yeah. But thank the Lord. But was able to have it twice this week. Tonight and in the morning. So good. Thank the Lord for that. How many come with expectation in your heart tonight. Brother Daryl's going to come and speak for us. And then we're going to have communion and and footwashing. And [clears throat] I know there's several saints in our in our church that need healing. And I want to remind you of what we've been taught in the message of the hour, which was taken from the book of Exodus, that there is healing in the communion. Brother Donnie, I've got this and that and the other. I know that we've got a lot of needs. But can you imagine some of them old people down the land of Egypt? They were crippled. They were halt. They were maimed. All kinds of things wrong with them. But when they ate that lamb, they came out of there changed. And I believe as we put this little piece of bread in our mouths tonight by faith in the promised word and the little symbol of the wine, God's healing power is just as real tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; Can we say it's good to be together in the house of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Oh, thank the Lord. We just want to invite Brother Daryl to come and bring to us what the Lord's placed on his heart. And we just open our hearts to that. How many has a need? I'm sure you do. All of us do. Let's just sing together. He touched me, Harry. No matter how many years that were around God's word and truth, there's one simple fact to be able to reach him, touch [music] him by your faith. If we can do that no matter what we have need of as it was pinned so many years ago. I was shackled by a head [singing] feed [music] me a [music and singing] load of guilt and shame. Thank you [music] Lord. Oh but then [singing] the hand of my Jesus you remember he [music] touched me and now I am [music and singing] no longer the same. Everybody now [music] brother Daryl to come. Oh, [music] [music] heat, heat. [music] And now [music] he touched me and [music] Amen. Aren't you grateful for the touch of the Lord Jesus? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, here a few years ago, I was preaching up in New Mexico, Brother Emanuel Salazars, and my back had went out on me. I spent two days in a hotel room laying on the floor with my feet up in a chair. So, I was to preach a certain night and brother Joe [music] Forny was in those meetings with me and he said, "Let me take your service tonight and you can have my service and I'd give you a couple more days." And I said, "Well, I'll just pray about it." And so I was praying and so I I text brother Juel back and said, "Brother Joel, I'm going to take the service tonight." He just text back and he goes, "Oh man." And it was all I could do to get to the pool pit. Matter of fact, when I got to the church, I had to climb steps to get up to the study. And when Brother Emanuel left to go down to give me a few minutes to myself, I laid on the floor of his study and put my took my shoes off, put my feet up on the couch cuz I was hurting so bad. And I got down to the pull pit. It was It was all I could do. God knows the truth to get one leg in front of the other. And I remember there in the study and I was just talking to the Lord and I said, "Lord, please don't make me stand in front of your people like this." And I got to the pull pit and I was just holding on to it cuz I was hurting so bad. And Sister Cindy Hunt and Brother David was in those services. And I was standing there and all of a sudden I felt a hand touch me on my back. And you know all the time have microphone trouble when I preach. So I thought for sure it was the song leader telling me that my mic wasn't working. And when I turned around to look behind me there was no one there. And I thought that was strange. And when I turned back around to face the people there's like two warm vials of water just came down my legs. We had a prayer line that night just [applause] there's just something &gt;&gt; about his touch. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. We trust you had a wonderful Christmas and certainly count an honor to be here and to take this service. And if you have your Bibles this evening, turn with me to the book of Psalms. We're going to read from Psalms 63, just one verse there, verse one. And we trust this will be a blessing to you tonight. It's just a a real simple thought because really that's the only kind I can preach. We trust it'll be a blessing to you. Just looking forward to the communion service. Amen. Psalm 63:1. The Bible says this, a psalm of David when he was in the wilderness of Judah said, "Oh God, thou art my God. Early will I seek thee. My soul thirsteth for thee. My flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is." Let's bow our heads. [snorts] I want to speak to you for just a few minutes this evening before the communion service on. We have found him who our hearts have thirsted for. We have found him in whom our hearts have thirsted for. Heavenly Father, we are grateful tonight Lord for all that you have done for us. And Lord, we thank you for this opportunity together here in your name. And father, we pray tonight that your anointing would come upon every one of us, dear God. That we could have a true communion, Lord, with you. [snorts] But Father God, we pray tonight that these simple little thought would stir our hearts, Lord, and prepare us for this communion service. Heal our sick, Lord, and strengthen our weak. We pray, [snorts] encourage those that would be discouraged, dear God. And as we move forward into a new year, may our desire to be, oh God, as a surrendered vessel that you could use us for your glory. We commit this congregation and oursel into your hands for your glory. For we ask these things in Jesus name. And the bride says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. May be seated. You know, when you spend time reading the book of Psalms, you come to understand that David being a Psalmsist was exceptionally skilled at expressing his feelings. The ability to pour out his raw, honest emotions. You realize that David had the ability to take life experiences and convey them into a psalm or into a song to express what he was feeling to his God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what we find here in Psalm 63:1. David desired to know God, to find God. And he likened this desire to know God as a thirst. And David said, "My soul thirsteth for thee." As in a dry land where there's no water. And David said, "My soul is so thirsty, God. I'm thirsting for you." Just just like I was in a land where there's there's no water. Like a person lost in the desert and it's hot and dry and weary and your skin's burdened. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And to be in a situation to where you just cry out, I've got to have water. &gt;&gt; Or I'll perish. My soul, David said, Lord, that that's the way I feel and that's the way I'm trying to describe it to you is my soul is thirsty for thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, years ago when I was a young man, I was in the army and I was in basic training in Fort Steel, Oklahoma. I was only 17 years old at the time and we was going on maneuvers and they ordered us all to get water in our cantens and there was so many boys trying to get water in their cantens that by the time they called the forest together into formation I didn't get the water. So we got out there and it was I was there in in June, July, August, September in in those months. I turned 18 in September of that year. But and it was extremely hot and we was out there and sweating and I got so thirsty and even that my my tongue began to feel like it was just sticking to my roof of my mouth and I was so thirsty and I didn't have no water and I saw I didn't know who this guy was but I was so thirsty. I said I said please could could I have just a drink of the water from your canteen? and he looked at me and he said, "No." And I'll tell you, [snorts] when I got to where I could find water, I was so thirsty that I drank and I drank and I drank and I could understand how David was feeling here. He said, "My desire to know you, God." &gt;&gt; It's like being in a land where there's no water. Another example of David's ability to convey what he was feeling is found in Psalms 119:83. He said, "For I have become like a bottle in the smoke, yet do I not forget thy statues." You see, in the bottles in the east were commonly made of skins, wine skin bottles. And in the small the peasantry dwellings for security and to get them out of the way, they would suspend them from the ceiling or hang them up against the wall. And these humble dwellings that these poor people had, they didn't have chimneys, so they just kind of had a hole where the smoke would go out and as the bottles would hang there, they would get black and they would begin to dry and they would they would become sy and cracked because they was in the smoke and they was in the heat. And David having to seen seen these bottles in that condition. So [snorts] when he finds himself in the midst of his trials, he remembered what those bottles looked like and he used them as an analogy or a means of expression of what he was feeling. Hence he said of himself, I I have become because of my trouble, because of my afflictions, my trials, my persecutions. He said, I'm just like that bottle in the smoke. In the midst of all my troubles, David said, "Though I'm like that bottle in the smoke, yet I do not forget thy statues, oh God." &gt;&gt; David's ability to express himself about thirst is once again found in Psalms 42. said to the chief musician Masquiteth after the waterbrooks so painth my soul after thee oh God my soul thirsteth for God for the living God when shall I come and appear before God thirsty is is a habit or showing a strong desire of something that David uses these terms because he had a strong desire to have fellowship to have true communion with God because you See, true communion is not just you doing all the talking, but true communion is you talking to God and God talking back to you. And David longed for that communion. &gt;&gt; David being a man that lived out in the woods and he learned a lot about the wildlife. And back in those countries, you know, the prophet said they had wild dogs or wolves and they would attack these deer and sometimes they would just wound them. And David's seeing the poor little deer there in such a wounded condition. And he watched that deer trying to get to water. And David said, "I'm just like that deer. I must find that water or perish. If I if he doesn't get the water, he's going to die. He's going to die. And the hounds of hell are after him." David said, "It's just like me. I've got to find God somewhere." &gt;&gt; Amen. as a dear thirst for the water book. So my soul thirst after thee, oh God, I have to have you or I'll die. As I was studying as I thought of the young man that come to the altar last Sunday and said, "I've got to have it. I can't go another day without it." But that's when we find him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for the waterbrook, for they shall find it. But see what makes a man have such a longing, such a thirst, such a hunger to find God. You see, something has to place that creation to thirst in man. &gt;&gt; Something has to put it there. In other words, before there is a creation, there has to be a creator to create the creation. &gt;&gt; And there is a creation in your heart to hunger and thirst for divine healing. God and a God that'll have mercy on you. There's got to be a God somewhere to have that mercy &gt;&gt; that creates that creation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Something that you're hungering for. Amen. And as long as human beings search and hunger and thirst and calling for the power of God, there's got to be a power of God somewhere to respond to that. Before there could be a creation, there has to be a creator in there creating that creation. Amen. &gt;&gt; When a man longs to see God, there's got to be somewhere. There's something that created that desire in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A deep calling unto the deep. There's got to be a deep to respond to that because there had to be a deep first there to create that call that's in you. And as we cut through Christmas and studying all these things, I I was thinking on these terms of listening to the tape of why it had to be shepherds and why were the shepherds in the field that glorious night when Christ was born. You see, they were there because it was the lamming season. It was the season when little lambs were born and they were gathered there watching over their flocks to find those lambs when they were born. You see these shepherds was lamb hunters &gt;&gt; and they were there in the fields watching over them in case you know that that they had difficulty in birthing them so that they could find the little ones when they were born and and help the sheep in delivery. Amen. It was the laming season and they're hunting lambs to assist them in difficult times. And the Bible said, "And so it was that while they were there that the days were accomplished that she should be delivered, and she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in a swaddling cloth, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the end." And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone around about them, and they were so afraid. And the angel said unto them, "Fear not, for I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people, for unto you is born this day in the city of David, a Savior, which is Christ the Lord." And this shall be a sign unto you. You shall find that babe wrapped in swaddling cloth, lying in a manger, not at the holiday end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In a manger. Why? Hallelujah. He was the lamb of God. Amen. And suddenly there was an angel, a multitude of heavenly hosts, praising God, and saying, "Glory to God in the highest and on earth, peace and goodwill towards men. And it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven." The shepherds said to one another, "Let us go now even to Bethlehem, and see this thing which has come to pass, which the Lord hath made known to us." And they came with haste, and they found him, &gt;&gt; in whom their hearts were thirsting &gt;&gt; for. They found Mary Barry and Joseph and the baby laying in a manger. When they had seen it, they made known abro saying which was told to them concerning this child. We have found him and whom our hearts has thirsted for. Why it had to be shepherds? Who better to announce the birth of the lamb of God than to shepherds who were in who were with their flocks during the birthing season hunting for newborn lambs? &gt;&gt; Amen. And he come by all nature just like regular lambs are born. He was the lamb of God and he was born along about that time and they were there hungering. There's something in them as shepherds to find lambs &gt;&gt; and they found him &gt;&gt; in a manger. The wise men longing and thirsting and searching to find the one in whom their hearts thirsted for. The Bible said when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king saying where is he that is born king of the Jews? For he have seen his star in the east that are come to worship him. When Herod heard the king when Herod the king had heard these things he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him. And when he gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of when this Christ child should be born. And they said unto him, Bethlehem of Judea, for thus as is written by the prophet, and thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah, art thou not least among the princes of Judah? For out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule thy people Israel. When Herod had heard privately, then Herod heard, when he had privately called the wise men, inquired of them, diligently of what time that star appeared, and he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, "Go and search diligently for the young child. When you found him, bring me word again that I may come and worship him." And when they had heard the king, they departed. And lo, the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was. Amen. And when they saw the star, they exceedingly rejoiced with they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy. And when they were coming to the house, they saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and fell down and worshiped him. And they opened their treasures and presented unto him gifts of gold and frankincense and myrr. the deity in service for death. &gt;&gt; Their gifts proved they had found him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In whom their hearts thirsted for &gt;&gt; they had the appropriate gifts to identify him &gt;&gt; on the earth. &gt;&gt; You see, God would reveal himself to those who expected him. Those magi that were expected to see a star of Jacob. They were from the east. They listened to Balam's prophecy which said there would be a star of Jacob rise and they were looking for it. They was expecting it. They were the ones who seen it. Amen. Why? Because they were looking for it. &gt;&gt; You usually get what you expect. The magi were expecting that star. They were watching for it. And when they saw it, they followed it. No one saw it but the magi. Why? Because it was for them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you wonder why can I see it and my brother can't see it or my mama can't see it or my daddy can't see it or my wife can't see it. But they saw it because it was for them to see it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We have seen his star. But his star wasn't in the east. They were in the east. They were looking westward towards Palestine. And they saw a star and they come to worship him. Oh my. Can you imagine in their hearts when they seen that star appear that they were looking for and they knew he was on the earth. They begin to hunger. They begin to thirst. They gathered their things. They said, "Let's go. We've got to go find him." They got the gold. They got the frankincense. They got the myrr. &gt;&gt; They wanted to do all they could do to worship him, to acknowledge him, to welcome him to the earth. There was a hunger. There was a thirst for this fellowship with this newborn king. Hundreds of miles they journeyed. They had an awful journey. They come over the mountain, sloped off the west side, followed the great Tigress River on down till they hit the land of Sar. They crossed by the fort perhaps down there, the river of Euphrates and journeyied on through Sahara. They probably had to travel by night because it was so hot in the daytime. And then again, they had to follow that star and it was only shining at night. It wasn't an overnight trip. It had taken 2 years for them to get there. A 2year journey &gt;&gt; through the desert and the swamps and the valleys and the mountains. But for two years, they come with this dirting desire to worship him. to find him, to have communion with him, to see him. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, the journey itself expressed the hunger to find him. &gt;&gt; They didn't go two days and well, it's just too far. Let's just go back. No, two years. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. If we come to church with that kind of attitude, what kind of service would we have? &gt;&gt; Amen. The journey itself expressed the hunger to find him. They were committed. They came searching. Tell us where he is. We've got to find him. We're thirsting to find him. They were wanting him. Blessed are they do hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled. &gt;&gt; [panting] &gt;&gt; But notice as they entered Jerusalem, you see a an intellectual thinking would would say, "Well, it's got to be Jerusalem. That's got to be where it's at." So when they got to Jerusalem, the star that was leading them went out. &gt;&gt; Why did the star go out? &gt;&gt; What kind of star was it? Yeah. &gt;&gt; The star that was leading him, it went out. Why? When they got to Jerusalem, because the star wasn't leading them to Jerusalem, &gt;&gt; it was leading them to Bethlehem. Oh, I'm so glad that the star I'm following is not leading me to a creed or a denomination. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But it's leading me to the house of God's bread. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. Amen. It wasn't leading him to Jerusalem. It was leading him to Bethlehem. Bethlehem is the house of God's bread. Then how could he be born to Jerusalem? How could he be born in Ramoth Galilee? See, he had to come to where his name was. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that if he was to come in this day, &gt;&gt; would not he have to come again &gt;&gt; to where his name? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Was &gt;&gt; I no longer call you church. &gt;&gt; I call you mistress Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Better make a Baptist shout. &gt;&gt; Amen. He come to where his name was, the house of God's bread. Jerusalem could have never satisfied that thirst. That thirst to find him could never be satisfied in Jerusalem. Why? He wasn't there. Why spend time searching where he ain't? Just look for where he's at. Amen. &gt;&gt; God doesn't dwell in the fanatics of the world. And down through the city they went, these wealthy men on these camels, but just they was just upset in the whole city, hollering, where is he? Where is he? Born king of the Jews. Their emotions stirred the city up and down. They went searching for him. See that they could find him on Hallelujah Avenue, but he wasn't there. They went over to the signs in Wonders Boulevard. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; But he wasn't there. &gt;&gt; They tried every street, but he wasn't there. Because you see, you do not know Christ by hallelujah. That's right. &gt;&gt; You do not know Christ by dancing in the spirit. &gt;&gt; You can dance in the spirit and not know him. You can know the Bible and forwards and backwards and not know him. &gt;&gt; True communion is not quoting the Bible. True communion is not running the aisle, but I enjoy to doing it when I feel like doing it. But what is true communion? It's you and Christ becoming one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You know Christ by knowing him in the person of the Holy Ghost took away your sins and planted an undying faith in a resurrected Lord Jesus Christ. That's the only way you can know him as a person. What is the new birth, brother Brandham? It's it's Christ revealed to you personally. &gt;&gt; You have met this person. [clears throat] You see, if you're thirsting for him, like the deer that painted after that of the waterbrook, like David was, like a shepherd hunting for a lamb, like a magi following a star, if you're thirsting for him, you will find him. &gt;&gt; Amen. For Jesus Christ is here in this building tonight &gt;&gt; where two or three are gathered in my name. I will be in their midst. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A little while the world sees me no more, but ye shall see me. I will be with you even in you. &gt;&gt; That he's here tonight in his power. All his power to heal every person in this building. Every person in this building tonight can be healed. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Why? He's here. His power is here. If you're looking for him, you'll find him. &gt;&gt; There's a fountain open tonight, brother. &gt;&gt; Man, hungers and thirst for God. There's bound to be something in there to create that thirst. If you don't get to the waterbrook, thirsting after God, I've got to find him. I've got to commune with him. I got to talk it over with you. That fellowship, [panting and sighs] there's something about that fellowship. &gt;&gt; When you're in your car and all of a sudden he comes in it. When you're in your prayer closet and all of a sudden he comes in it. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about tonight. When all of a sudden you know [laughter] he's here. Amen. [panting] &gt;&gt; If there's a thirst in your heart, it shows there's a touch of God somewhere that mankind can find, [sighs and gasps] there's a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emanuel's veins where sinners plunge beneath that flood and lose all their guilty states. If you're hungry for more of God, that's the evidence. There's more of God for you to be to receive. If you're striving for a revelation that proves there's more revelation of God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Remember the prophet said we'd be learning of him throughout the millennium. It's an unfolding. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Never put a period behind your experience. Always put a comma. I believe God in this and anything else that he by his grace would reveal to me. &gt;&gt; [gasps] [panting] &gt;&gt; God made man with the thirst. That's a part of the human being. It's his thirst. &gt;&gt; I went up to the hospital to see brother Lynn this morning. We was talk trying to talk to him and bless his heart. And his speech is real slurred. And so we had prayer with him and I was getting ready, me and brother Scotty Bab was there and I was getting ready to leave and he started doing his mouth like this. He was going sweet. And Diane, which is his daughter-in-law, she said, "I think he's wanting something sweet. He loves sweet stuff." And she said, "Sylvia's coming after a while. Lyn, she's going to bring you something sweet." And I said, "Well, really, I got to preach. I got to go." And he he just grabbed a hold of me and he was just frantically grabbing a hold of my arm in my hand. And he was going, "Sweet, sweet." Oh, the Lord help me understand what he what it is he's wanting cuz he was longing. He was thirsting for something. And I said, "Sw, is he saying swig?" I said, "Relin, do you want some water?" He said yes. [panting] And we got him some water and he drank the water and that water satisfied that thirst &gt;&gt; that even though he was trying his best to express what he was needing &gt;&gt; cuz he was hungering for water. &gt;&gt; Yeah. [panting] &gt;&gt; God made man to thirst. He put a thirst in man to thirst for God. And the devil's perverted it and make you thirst for his kingdom and for the world. But the thirst in man is godly. For God made man to thirst. God made man to thirst for God. So it is they that cry of hunger hearts today. Where is that Jesus? That's the same yesterday, today, and forever. We have felt his spirit on us &gt;&gt; and we've come to worship him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I say to you and I tonight, we have found him. in whom our hearts have thirsted for. &gt;&gt; But we didn't find him in a manger. We didn't find him in a creed. We didn't find him in a dogma. But we found him in a message that has led us to the revelation of where he is in our day. We have found him in whom our hearts have thirsted for. &gt;&gt; But don't miss this. This is the point I want to bring you tonight. this hunger, this thirst that's in your soul. But I want you to understand in reality, it wasn't you who found God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. It wasn't you, brother. I hunger. I thirst. I longed. But it wasn't you who found him. &gt;&gt; It was God who found us. Amen. Hallelujah. That longing that we felt it [laughter] [panting] it was God looking for us. [panting and gasps] &gt;&gt; What made those shepherds seek out after Jesus to find where the word was made flesh? What caused them to do that? It was the angel's message. &gt;&gt; You see, if there had been no angel appearing before the shepherds, they would have not known where to go. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But this angel said unto them, "We bring you great good tidings of great joy. For in this day, born in the city of David is a savior, and you shall be a sign to you. You shall find this babe wrapped in swaddlecloth, lied in a manger." The angels told him exactly where he was. &gt;&gt; What made those J magi take off on a two-year journey? The appearing of the star. &gt;&gt; If there had been no star, they would have never found the Christ. &gt;&gt; They were studying, watching for that star. What created that thirst in the shepherds? What created that longing, that hunger in the Magi's heart? What made that? It was God wanting to be found. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We didn't find him. He found us. God was drawing us to himself. &gt;&gt; Notice that's God's desire. God's desire is not just to be with his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. He wants to be in his people. &gt;&gt; You see, that's true communion. &gt;&gt; That's true fellowship. Two fellas in the same ship. &gt;&gt; What agreement hath the temple of God with idols. For you are the temple of the living God. As God has said, I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their people and they shall be I will be their God and they shall be my people. Notice where he said, "I will not dwell with them, but I will dwell in them. And I will not walk with them, but I will walk in them." &gt;&gt; True communion. You see, God is a lover. God is love. &gt;&gt; And God so loved the world that when they were unlovable that he gave his son to make them lovable. &gt;&gt; And here it is. God wants to come down and make love to you. He's seeking, thirsting, hungering. God is seeking, thirsting, hungering, trying to get some of your starchy hearts &gt;&gt; to make love to you &gt;&gt; as a love affair. Not a law will I have to do it. No, no, no. It's not a law. &gt;&gt; It's love. Nobody has to make me worship God. Nobody has to make me. It's not at all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I worship him because I love him. I pray because I love him. I seek out his fellowship because I want to be where he is. &gt;&gt; I just want to be where you are. [panting] [gasps] Amen. [laughter] A love affair, not a law of love. It's all in love. Who weward man or woman sitting here? If there's something in you telling you this is right, it's the Holy Spirit seeking you out. &gt;&gt; Glor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If something is here telling you this message is right, &gt;&gt; it's the Holy Spirit seeking you out. &gt;&gt; Then what spirit would try to get you to pull away from it? &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Spirit seeking you out, trying to bring you to a knowledge of truth of this hour that we're now living. Not not some other hour that's done gone by. He didn't come to reveal to us Luther's day. That's done been done. But this is our day, our hour, thy time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [panting] &gt;&gt; He's calling to you for the hour is now. You see, we wasn't looking for Elijah. I wasn't looking for Elijah. Was you looking for Eli? I wasn't looking for him, Brother JD. &gt;&gt; But God sent Elijah looking for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. [panting] &gt;&gt; We have seen his star in the west. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The seventh star. Hallelujah. We have seen that seventh star. And where is it leading us? It's leading us back east to the restoration of the brritory. It's leading us back to where you find the word is made flesh again. Where is that word made flesh in this hour? It is made flesh in you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; How many Christians here we see you raise your hand. If you're a Christian, raise your hand. He said you're not a Christian by your desire. [clears throat] You're a Christian by God's &gt;&gt; desire. &gt;&gt; You never did seek God. At any time, it was God seeking you. [panting] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; David said, "I hunger. I thirst like a deer trying to find water." Why was he saying that? He was God seeking out David. [gasps] [panting] &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; No man at any time has ever sought God. &gt;&gt; God sought man. He was elected by God before the foundation of the world &gt;&gt; to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; Oh God. [panting] &gt;&gt; I was not put here to fail. &gt;&gt; I was not put to be a denomination. &gt;&gt; Come on somebody. I wasn't put here to be a drunk. I was elected by God before the foundation of the world to be here in this hour. Amen. That I could be a tabernacle. That I could be a house. That God could come down and express himself in his fullness in this hour. For every mystery of God has been made known. Why has the mysteries been made known? Because there is a people on the earth who can receive them. For they know what he wants done with his word. Thou have thus sayeth the Lord. Or keep him still. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, [applause] Lord. Thank you, Lord. [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; No man, no man can come to me. Jesus said, "No man can come to me except my father draws him first." &gt;&gt; Amen. You see the very strain from the Garden of Eden, instead of the fallen sinner trying to find God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It was God who came through the garden crying, "Adam, &gt;&gt; Adam, &gt;&gt; where are you, son? [panting] It's evening time. I want to have communion. I want to have communion. Where are you? [panting] Where are you? I was in an old building down in Jumpsburg 2:00 on a Sunday afternoon, December the 21st, 1981. I've been out drinking the night before. &gt;&gt; But he came into the room, Brother Dy, &gt;&gt; I knew it was him cuz I felt him when I was a boy. I knew it was him. [laughter] &gt;&gt; He found me in an old building. &gt;&gt; [crying] &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Where did he find you? &gt;&gt; Where are you standing here tonight? Because he found you. [panting] [snorts] sinner and he has been ever since. Who looked out? Who searched out? Who sought out the first lost son? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then who seeks out every lost &gt;&gt; son and daughter? &gt;&gt; God does. &gt;&gt; Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man will open, I will come into him and I will suck with him. I'll commune, have fellowship with him. God wants fellowship. That's what God's heart longs for tonight. He longs for it. He longs for it. When Jesus was here, he had no coat. But he never asked the father for a coat. He walked everywhere he went. All kinds of people come by him in chariots, but he never asked God for a vehicle. He had no place to lay his head. The birds have nests. The foxes have burrows. But I, the son of man, hath no place to lay my head. But he never [laughter] asked the father for a home. The only thing he ever asked the father for was her fellowship. True communion to bring God and man together to make them one. He wants that. That's God's desire tonight above everything is to have his church [panting] one with him. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; More than a wafer. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; More than a piece of bread, &gt;&gt; more than a cup of wine, &gt;&gt; but a true fellowship. &gt;&gt; Well, you say, "I love you, Papa." He says, "I love you, Rob. [gasps] [sighs and panting] How do I know that he loves me?" Because he reveals himself to me. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So I could understand him. [sighs] &gt;&gt; Oh, do you love him tonight? &gt;&gt; It's God's desire above everything is to have this church one with him. &gt;&gt; It makes you wonder how Enoch really walked with God. But he said Enoch walked with God and he was not because God took him because he had this testimony before his trampure before his translation that he pleased God. Oh my. Do you love him tonight? &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. Real hurry. guys come try to cut it a little short tonight because of communion. I wasn't sure how many would be here but just for a few more minutes I wonder can you open your heart? Can you open every door of your heart and say Lord come in just Lord not not only be my savior I don't want you just to be my savior &gt;&gt; but be my lord be my ruler be my counselor take me what I am just as I am without one plea that thy blood was shed for me just as I am Lord I'll believe you. I wonder tonight before we take this communion if we could just have this moment to go before him and say, "Lord this hunger. I give it to you. Satisfy this thirst that you placed in me. Guide me, Lord. Direct me, Lord. I sacrifice my thoughts. Let the mind of Christ or let it be in me that I may have a true communion. Let that longing, that thirst, not be satisfied with just a piece of bread and a sip of wine, but with a true communion. Let our lives be filled with him. Not just in a communion service, not just in a sip of wine, but in a constant drinking. For Jesus said, "Whosoever drinkketh of this water that I shall give you, that shall give him shall never thirst, but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. Whosoever drinks of this water, notice he didn't say just take a sip and walk away. But he said drinkkeeth. It's a continuation. &gt;&gt; He that drinkketh it's a keep drinking. Whosoever drinkkeeth of this water that I give give him shall never thirst because that thirsting is for him. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Oh my. He found me. He found you. He in whom our hearts has thirsted for has found us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads tonight. Heavenly Father, Lord, I pray this little broke up, simple thought, Lord, pleased you, God. For Lord, it's truly my desire to hear you say, "Well done." And Lord, as I stand here tonight, I give you, Lord, my all. And Lord, sometimes I feel like that little boy's lunch. Nothing at all. But oh God, if you could use me, Lord, I give myself to you. Father, may that be the prayer of all of us tonight, Lord, as this communion service. We're so grateful to be able to to have it, Lord, on a Saturday evening. But Lord, during this time, let us just take a moment to examine our lives, Lord, to open every door, every closet, every pantry, Lord, to throw out things in our life that would hinder you from taking your full abode. And may tonight, Lord, we be willing as we pass through this communion line to lay it at your feet, Lord. And Father God, as we partake of this bread and wine, as a symbol, Lord, may the reality of your presence come into every heart, into every home, every man, woman, boy, and girl that when we go out those doors, Lord, we can be a light to a dying generation. Grant it, Lord, tonight, whoever's head's bowed, just a moment. And I wonder if you'd say, "Brother, Darl, that's truly my desire tonight. I I understand what you're trying to say. And I want that also more than anything in my life. I want more of him. More love, more mercy, more grace, more power, more surrender, more of you in my life. Lord, God bless those hands there that raised them. [snorts] Perhaps you didn't feel you needed to raise your hand. Won't you pray for that person beside you? For perhaps they did that this would be our desire tonight. Because you see, brothers and sisters, we wasn't ever looking for him, but he came looking for me. He came looking for you, Lord God. You see the hands that was raised tonight, Lord. this quiet moment of time, we simply Lord surrender everything we have to you Lord. In Jesus name we pray. You see my brother, my sister tonight, Lord, as they pass through this line, those that are afflicted, Lord, those in need, may every need be met tonight, Lord. For you have come in this service as you said you would, Lord. your desire, Lord, as a fellowship with us tonight, Lord, with thanksgiving in our heart. We say to you, Father, thank you that you came looking for us in Jesus name we pray. Amen. And amen. Do you love him tonight, friends? &gt;&gt; Amen. But Harry, sing that song for us, buddy. Let's just worship you just for a moment before we turn the service over to brother [music] Donnie. &gt;&gt; One night while life's raging sea it looked as [music] if I would suffer [singing] defeat. As the blackness of night [music] closed off the light, my heart sank with fear. [singing] Abundance red cry [music] rang out with fright. All I could see [music and singing] was no hope inside. With faith all but gone, I met the one who came looking for [music and singing] me. He came looking for me. [music and singing] He came looking for me. [singing] He made a way [music] when there was no way [singing] that I could see. [music] So far, Jesus was near to rescue my soul [music and singing] and calm all my fear. Now I'm safe from all harm since I met the one who came looking [singing and music] for me. He came looking for me. [singing] He came looking for me. [music] He [singing] made a way when [music] there was no way that I could see. [music] When I drifted so far, Jesus was near [singing] to rescue [music] my soul and calm all my fear. Now I'm safe from all harm. I [music] met the one who came looking for me. [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, Satan had already picked out my grave and plan and moved forward to put me away. [singing] I drifted so far. Would anyone [music] care that I soon be lost? I [music and singing] knew my destruction was a matter of time. [music] But Jesus appeared and said, "This one is mine. Now I'm [music] safe with no harm." [singing] He walked through the storm. He came looking for [music] me. He came looking for [music and singing] me. He came looking for me. He came looking for me. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; He made a way when there [singing] was no way that I could see. [music] I drifted so far. Jesus [music] was here [singing] to rescue my soul and calm all my [music] fears. Now I'm safe from all harm. He came looking [singing] for me. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; He came looking for me. He came looking for me. [music] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he did? &gt;&gt; He made a way. He &gt;&gt; made a way. &gt;&gt; When there was [music] no way that I could see. [music] When I drifted so far, Jesus was near to rescue my [music and singing] soul and calm all my fear. Now I'm safe from all harm. I met the one who came looking [music] for me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Thank you, brother Daryl. That wonderful. Praise the Lord. [applause] God bless you. You can be seated if you'd like to read with me in U 1 Corinthians chapter 11 verse 23. I was listening today to the sermon that brother Brand preached entitled communion in 1962 and if you haven't listened to it in a while it do good to listen to it. He said that really what we are about to participate in here tonight is not actually communion. And he said communion is whenever you are communing back and forth. So he identified even a preacher. He said when you go to hear a preacher, you're not actually having communion with that preacher. Now what happened here tonight was that the preacher was inspired by God and gave us the words that the Lord put on his heart. But what did we do? Do we talk back to him? We sat there and said amen and nodded our head and said, "Praise the Lord." And I was blessed. but wasn't actually communing with him. And that's the way a lot of folks are when it comes to church. They go to church, but they're not actually communing with God. So, they come and fellowship with one another and fellowship with societies and this and that and the other. Um, but they're not communing with God, but we want to have true communion with him. &gt;&gt; So, the prophet went on to say that people get down to pray and they tell God, I want this, I want that, I need that, I want that. Amen. He said, "All you've done is just brought your needs and your list to God, your request, but you didn't give God time to talk back to you." Brother Donnie, you mean you think God would talk to me? It's not important what I think. What do you think? &gt;&gt; Do you think he will? &gt;&gt; I believe with all of my heart. He desires to commune with us more than we even believe and realize ourselves. Let's read together. [clears throat] For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread. As I've been thinking today and praying and just pondering over these scriptures, it just so blessed my heart as I begin to realize that this is the only place in the scripture where we actually have the formula, as we would say, to know how to even take communion. And I want you to notice where Paul said he got it from. For I have received from the Lord. Anybody here going to debate that? I was hoping there was nobody that dumb. [clears throat] Oh, so you mean to tell me that one man received from the Lord the way and the order that we should have communion? &gt;&gt; And millions of people have observed this down through the ages. And only one man got it from God. I figured somebody shout glory after that. &gt;&gt; For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. Now remember in the four gospels they wrote what Jesus done but they actually never put it together for us to tell us how to do it. But God gave it to his prophet messenger in the first age. And when he had given thanks, he break it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me." After the same manner also he took the cup and when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death." Now Jesus never said this. Matthew, Mark, Luke, nor John never said this. But Paul received this from the Lord &gt;&gt; and it became scripture. &gt;&gt; This is the way God reveals his word through prophets. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the prophets. &gt;&gt; For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you shu the Lord's death till he come. Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. Now, this is what we're supposed to do. Well, brother Donnie, I'm waiting till I'm perfect to take communion, which means you'll never take it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Which means you'll never take it. &gt;&gt; But these are the instructions from the Lord through his messenger. Notice this. Let a man examine himself, which the word I looked at it this evening, test, try, prove, see if there's anything outstanding that you need to fix. Let a man examine himself. And then on the night they have communion, stay home. &gt;&gt; That's what a lot of folks do. But let a man examine himself. And so let him eat. &gt;&gt; Oh wow. So after you examine yourself, then if there's anything that needs to be fixed, what you do? You go to the fixer. &gt;&gt; And then what are you supposed to do? You're supposed to eat. You see, those who eat and drink damnation to themsel are people that know they got things in their life that it's not right with the Lord, but they don't examine themsel and ask God to fix it for them. So then if they go ahead and do that, that's when they fulfill this verse. This is not talking about people who are confessing their wrongs before the Lord and asking him to fix them. Because if he didn't, nobody could take communion. Not even the preacher that preached to us tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or the preacher reading this scripture to you. So this is our part. We examine oursel. But let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. For he eateth and drinkketh unworthily. Eatith and drinkkeeth, notice this now, damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. For if you would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. Now, we're going to bow our heads and you're praying, of course, for your brothers and sisters that are around. You heard the prophet today as he did this and he said, "Now, you're praying for them if there would be anything in their heart that they need to make right that the Lord will help them to be able to make it right." So, you pray for yourself, of course, and you're praying for your brothers and sisters as well. And remember, as I said a while ago, there's healing in the communion. I've been praying all day today, just off and on all day, that God would visit us in such a mighty way here tonight, and bring healing. So many saints are sick with different things in their body. I believe this is true, don't you? Let's just bow our heads together and we'll have have just a moment of silent prayer of deacon brothers, if they'll come. I pray for your children tonight. Father, your God, search each heart, Lord. Each person, Lord Jesus, if there's anything, dear God, that needs to be fixed, may they fix it, Lord. May they lay it right in your presence tonight, God. Search me. Search every one of us, Lord. Dear God, we come to you. May you look at us. We examine ourselves, but you're the only one, dear God, that can fix us. Help us tonight, Father. Minister to us. I pray tonight, dear God. Many of your children are sick and they need healing. Lord God, when they press this little piece of bread to their lips and this cup of wine, may the healing virtue of Jesus Christ go through their bodies. Granted, I pray Lord, Jesus name. Heavenly Father's dear God, I pray you sanctify this bread. Lord, we know that no has the power to turn it into your body, but it's a symbol to us. But Lord, it is sacred. It is precious. May every child of God that comes here tonight, Lord, may they take that sacredness in their heart this way, Father Jesus. Lord Jesus, the blood of your grace, as I lift the lids from you, dear God, the aroma begins to come up into my face. Lord, I know that it's not water. I know it's not Kool-Aid. It's not tea. But it's and to know Lord this don't get weak but it gets stronger and stronger. Lord God how grateful we are. For many of us years ago it would take to I think of myself Lord how many times I took it and I took it with a cracker and grape juice. But tonight Lord I could stand here because Because the revelation has been restored in the last days. It was bread and wine. Another truth, oh God, that was to be come back in the end time. Father, sanctify this wine, dear God, I pray. Bless your children as they partake in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] Heat. [music] [music] Hey, heat.

But the washing of the blood and the cleansing of the soul and the changing of the nature is going to make a way for him to walk in us. As brother Daryl quoted it, walk is a manner of life. Something that is automatically lived out by a nature inside of a person. So this is why God didn't want to just be with us and walk beside us. He wanted to walk in us, live his own life out of us. So now he's going to show us some of the things he would do. And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas's Scariot, Simon's son, to betray him. Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, that he was come from God and went to God. He riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself. Almighty God going to wash his disciples feet. After that he pth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. Then cometh he to Simon Peter. And Peter saith unto him,"Lord, dust thou wash my feet?" Jesus answered and said unto him, "What I do, thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter?" Peter sth unto him, "Thou shalt never wash my feet." Jesus answered him, "If I wash thee not, thou has no part with me." Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. Jesus saith to him, he that is washed needeth not to wash his feet, but is clean every wit. And ye are clean, but not all. For he knew who should betray him. Therefore said he, you are not all clean. So after he had washed their feet and taken his garments and was set down again, he said unto them, now can you imagine sitting there 2,000 years ago? Jesus would have washed our feet, would have got his robe, put it back around him because he'd used part of that to gert himself. And he would sat down and we're sitting there looking at him and thinking, "What is he going to say? What just happened to us?" Now listen at these words. Know ye what I have done to you. For you call me Master and Lord. Notice this now. You say well for so I am. If I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet. Ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, an example that you should do as I have unto done unto you. Verily, verily, I say unto you, the servant is not greater than his Lord, neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. If you know these things, happy are ye if you do them. Brothers, remain here. Sisters, go over in the fellowship hall. And I want to um just say I know for your sisters that'll be taking your children with you. I know it's a little bit difficult for them because the fellowship hall is where they you know eat and drink and do this and that and the other. But just keep just keep reminding them that this is a sacred time. So it's not a time to eat and fellowship and things. So just help each other out if you need to just to watch one another. We want it to be sacred. I felt I've felt a just an awesome presence of the Lord around me all day today. A sacredness, a special something. I believe he wants us to keep it in reverence and honor. Don't you? God bless you. Your sister as you go there. God be with you. Brothers, you can gather here around the front.
