Lord that are out of our control Lord the world spinning in one direction of chaos Lord but you've called a bride you've called a people Lord for you you said we didn't say Lord you said I'll have a bride without spot or wrinkle or any such thing Lord and I believe just as Shadrach Meshach and have been to go father met you not outside the fire Lord but they had to go into the fire they had to go into the darkness they had to go into the unknown and there was the son of God Lord and I read your Bible father and it said when they came out of that fire there was not even a smell of the fire on their clothes Lord and when we come out of this world there won't be a hint of lady Asiya there won't be a hint of sin there won't be a hint of failure or disease Lord but we'll be wholly clean and wide in the righteousness that you give us Lord we thank you for that Lord God we thank you that you've given us a peace Lord we thank you that we have a relationship with you the very God who made heavens and earth has come down in this place to speak to us we love you Lord with all our hearts we bless your name the church says amen do you love the Lord this morning do you really love him amen you know there's one thing in my life I have fallen in love with Jesus Christ amen I have a real love for his word I have a love for his presence I have a love for him in my life be lost without him wouldn't you amen well it's certainly good to be back here with you this morning if you have your Bible we'll turn to the book of second Kings keep you standing you believe the Lord has something for you this morning the Bible says that he's a rewarder of those that diligently seek him and I know that if you need to touch from him this morning he can speak to you Lord's been heavy on my heart since last night for this sermon that I'm going to preach to you this morning and I pray that you just give me grace this morning give me some time amen I want to really deliver my heart the Lord has just a burden upon my heart and I believe it's for somebody this morning I'd like to preach to you on a sermon out I've titled a time when Kings go to battle a time when Kings go to battle verse one says and it came to pass after the year was expired at the time when Kings go forth to battle that David sent Joab and his servants with him and all Israel they destroyed the children of Amon and besieged Rabbah but David tarried still at Jerusalem this one mistake this one bad choice led to such calamity in this man's life verse 2 says it came to pass in an evening tide that David arose from off his bed and walked upon the roof of the king's house and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman was very beautiful to look upon and David sent and inquired after the woman and one said is not this Bathsheba the daughter of Eliam the wife of Uriah the Hittite David sent messengers and took her and she came in unto him and he lay with her verse 5 and the woman conceived and sent and told David and said I am with child and David sent to Joab saying send me Uriah of the hittite and Joab sent Uriah to David verse 15 and he wrote in the letter saying set you Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle and retire you from him that he may be smitten and die and it came to pass when Joab observed the city that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were and the men of the city went out and fought with Joab and there fell some of the people of the servants of daiva David and Uriah the Hittite died also one more scripture will have you turn over to the book of Ecclesiastes Ecclesiastes chapter 3 Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 1 and we'll read verse 8 verse 1 says to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven verse 8 a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peace a time of war and a time of peace let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord my heart is heavy this morning Lord and that is stand here in your presence Lord and these people have came father we've all have expecting hearts this morning we're all thirsty hungry Lord for your word we pray God that your word would find its place in every avenue of our life Lord may every person in this building be sensitive to the relevance of the word and what area the Lord speaking to them knowing God that you'll speak in many different ways I pray God you would be with me Lord as I deliver tried my best to deliver this to these people I pray God we could learn something this morning from the life of a man that's so great so profound Lord and so alike ours I pray God that you would take hearing hearts speak to them this morning father may you plant a seed in someone's life we pray take control we ask in Jesus name amen you can be seated a time when Kings go to battle I'd like to say a few things if you keep your Bible handy we're going to use it a lot this morning keep your place there in second Kings chapter 11 we're going to be going back and forth but I'd like to say just a few things and to establish some principles that very often maybe can get overlooked or very often can be forgotten but I believe that they're relevant for you this morning you cannot hide from God you cannot hide from God you can hide from me you can hide from your pastor you can hide from your wife you could hide things from your husband you could hide things from your children but you can't hide from God God sees everything he knows the intention of your heart for every choice that you make every decision everything that you say in conversation God looks at one thing your heart and God the Bible says he who searches the heart and knows the mind so God knows us inside and out you cannot hide from God the Bible says in Ecclesiastes 8:11 because senate's against an evil work is not executed speedily therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully setting them to do evil another word Solomon says that just because we don't reap what we sow over night doesn't mean that we don't reap what we sow but the Bible says God will not be mocked whatsoever a person sews that person shall also reap but the Bible says because sin it's because that reaping doesn't always happen overnight you can live a life in sin for years thinking you're getting away with it you can live a life in secret sin for 10 years 15 years and think just because judgment has not been passed that somehow we've slipped by or somehow we've gotten by God but understand this you shall reap what you sow you know many times we could pray for children for years and not see anything in wonder if God's here in our prayer and then one day the appointed time comes and that seed that you've been watering for years and years and years comes to harvest we're told of a bamboo seed that the heart the farmer that plants a bamboo seed he has to plant that thing in faith because it's very different than other seeds you see usually a farmer and human nature is to work based upon what we see if we don't see results we give up and so a farmer under normal circumstances plant the seed puts it in the ground and begins to water it he begins to labor for that seed he begins to give it sunlight he begins to nourish it and address it and the next day he comes and maybe there's a sprout up and maybe there's a green leaf and he's told by that sign that my efforts are paying off but the farmer who plants a bamboo seed is very different because although he waters it although he dresses it although he nourishes it for days and I forget how long the process I think it's something like six months he sees absolutely no sign whatsoever that his efforts have done anything at all the only thing he can do is put faith in the process the only thing he could do is put faith in nature knowing that nature will run its course and after six months of just doing the same thing over it's much like when you pray over and over and over and over and you wonder is God ever gonna hear my prayer is anything ever gonna change am I ever gonna reap the harvest of what I've been sowing but after six months that tree that bamboo shoot' shoots up six feet tall in just a couple weeks you know this is the way it is with sin for many years we could sow the wrong seed and think that we don't see any result from it so it's okay and something starts so small in our heart your sin will find you out the Bible says in numbers 32:23 if you will not do so behold you have sinned against the Lord and be sure be sure your sin will find you out the Bible paints a very amazing picture of a man who thinks he's sinning and getting away much like a fugitive you know when a fugitive a person commits a sin person commits some heinous act and he goes on the run running from the police running from the government running from the law and that man thinks he can get away with an alibi I really pulled one over I really pulled one over no one's ever gonna know and I got away with it and now I got all this money or whatever the profit was but the part that you don't see is the man his entire life he's always looking behind his shoulder he's always miserable wondering if anybody's gonna find out and eventually that pressure will cause him to make a mistake and the law the whole time is chasing him looking for him watching for him watching they know eventually he'll make a mistake and this is the picture that the Bible paints for a man running from God and your sin literally follows you and haunts you and chases you you may move from church to church you may move from place to place but you can't outrun God you can't outrun the Spirit of God if you're a son of God he'll chase you he'll haunt you he'll bring you to justice and the Bible says the wages of sin what it pays its payment you know what it pays death pleasure for a season thinking that we've gotten away Isaiah 29 15 and 16 woolen - they'll wall unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord and their works are in the dark and they say who sees us and who knoweth us no one's gonna find out this just happened once she'll never know he'll never know I can just cover it up and it'll be okay and I'll just move on and the pain that it would cost him for me to confess that would be greater than the reward you know who's talking to you the liar the father of lies are you here this morning woe unto them now listen job 34 21 says for his whose God's his eyes are upon the ways of man and he seeth all his goings there is no darkness nor shadow of death where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves human beings think they can hide from God and eventually this secret sin begins to drive us from the presence of God the first thing that Adam and Eve do after the Fallen nature comes in after that after the fall happens one of the first attributes is to hide to cover up to make a religion to ease the conscience to cover themselves and the first thing that a person a Christian will do after living a life of sin that no one knows about they'll begin to hide themselves Satan will 'you don't know what you don't want to know what the devil will do to you he'll push you away from church he'll push you away from fellowship he'll push you away from brothers and sisters you'll become reclusive as is not attributes of God the Bible says in him there is no darkness at all there is only light there is only exposure listen Christians should be the most transparent people on the face of the earth we have nothing to hide we have nothing to run from it is the devil who pushes you into a closet it is the devil who tells you don't confess don't make it right it is the devil who puts fear in your heart to stay under that religious cloak Kayne's unconfessed sin turns him into a vagabond a fugitive he begins to run and run and hide he never has a dwelling place don't you know this is exactly where the devil wants you don't you know this is exactly the first thing that happens after you sin is condemnation who do you think you are look at you you're nothing you're not a son of God you had all that victory was raised in your hands in church and now look at you you think that's God who's telling you that my Bible says in the book of Hebrews let us come boldly you know the reason why people don't take advantage of this Scripture is because we think that this is Paul is speaking of when we feel spiritual when we feel on the mountain when we feel like we've done something good and boy I'm feeling so good and I'm feeling so spiritual I could just march on into the presence of God but this is not the application that he's even referring to you want to know when he says to come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy [Applause] hallelujah and find help in the time of me listen the devil pushes you away and tells you stay away and you're no good and your rotten God says come unto me the Bible says you have a father who is faithful and just hallelujah to forgive your sins but the church say Amen this morning to forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness aren't you glad that's the kind of God that we serve listen we don't have a father who kicks us when we're down and pushes us away but he says in all embrace you if you'll embrace me I'll clean you I'll wash your mind of the condemnation listen we're all failures we're all just a bunch of no good save by Amazing Grace His grace becomes more amazing the more you serving Satan because Sarris Cain becomes a wonderer listen sin will take you further than you want to go it'll cost you more than you're willing to pay and it'll keep you longer than you want to stay you say brother Matt why would you preach on sin this morning why would you take such a topic that's so simple because I believe we're living in the most sinfully deceptive age where sin is more accessible than it's ever been before everybody wants to be Revelator's everybody wants to get more knowledge and understanding but the problem is most people have never even really repented you find a person listen your level of victory is based upon your level of repentance and repentance is not a prayer repentance is an action Satyam them sorry cane becomes a wonder or satan pushes them Elena you noticed this a wonder or a person who have no direction in life they just sort of go in a cycle always up always down always in always out one week in one week out profit totem camp stars they go from one camp meeting to the next their spiritual there their shouting in church but on Monday victories gone they get on the sin cycle you know what that is sin confess commit the same sin confess commit the same sin confess commit the same sin confess around and around and around and never have with the prophet called a v-day a victory day listen I don't want to go in circles with God I want to have victory is that what this church once this morning I want victory in my family I want victory in my home I want to put my foot down once and for all once and for all and be finished with sin their conscience becomes seared as we said last night that searing process after you sin and you don't confess you think it's okay well it's no big deal you know just happen once and you know it's okay and I'll get over it and you know she doesn't need to know and he doesn't need to know and they don't need to find out and you know goodness the pain that would cause and he did you don't over the mat what would happen hell you know what your dude you're doing what Eve did your reasoning your reasoning listen there's only honesty Christ can only give you real victory in confession the Bible says confession is good for the soul confession is good for your soul it's good for your family it's good for your prayer life the conscience becomes seared when we repeatedly sin now notice this here in second Samuel we're gonna look at the sin with David and Bathsheba something that no doubt you've looked at many many many times before but I want you to notice and we're gonna we're going to show you a lot of things out of the scripture turn back to 2nd Samuel quickly if you could second Samuel chapter 11 the sin is not dealt with as the movie Hollywood puts out a film when David and Bathsheba and they focus on the sin the Bible doesn't the Bible mentions at one time and then it spends a lot of time telling you the consequences Bible never is sent to glorify sin but it says these things were written for our examples you believe that 2nd samuel evident came to pass after the year was expired this is Missy this is the beginning of months so we know what season it is and seasons very important this is not winter time you don't go to war a king doesn't start his campaign in the middle of the winter especially not in Tennessee where there's no fruit there's no vegetation it's all cold King doesn't go to wars in but you have to realize there was a certain season there was a certain time that takes place when a king prepares for battle he doesn't do it in the summer definitely not in South Carolina where there's gnats and mosquitoes and snakes and bugs and it's hot and humid you see it's very important notice for the King to discern the season that he's living in because if he fails to discern the season he won't realize when wars taking place and when there's a time of peace taking place notice this the year was expired teen Kings go forth to battle and David sent Joab his servant so David decides not to go that's what the Bible says he sent Joab and his servants with him in all Israel and they destroyed the children of Amon and besieged Rabbah but David carried still at Jerusalem so David decides to stay home he decides now you know y'all go on ahead y'all go on without me I know I've been there many other campaigns and we're just fighting Amon now it's very interesting the Bible says that they destroyed the children of Amon yet in chapter 10 David's fighting Amon but he's there he's warring with Amon but now in chapter 11 the battles not over business is not finished and David decides I'll go on ahead I'll stay here no big deal you know just go on ahead without me and you know Yodas go ahead no it's amazing how much different listen it's amazing how much different this David is then the David we read about chapters and chapters before this is the same man who comes on a battlefield is a little shrimp and he looks at a big tall giant and says who is this that defies the armies of the Living God who is this uncircumcised Philistine David says today I'll cut your head off with my sword and I'll feed it to the birds you notice the courage in david you notice the vigor in david you notice the energy the seal that he has very different from this david that wants to stay in bed all morning and have somebody else go do the work you see david has such courage and he has such such a zeal to go forth in the battle but listen David was not firing from the hip David was not just speaking for you know just quick and and just being a smart aleck but David had a reality in his life and do you want to know where that reality came from I want to say a few things number one the Giant does not just show up when a in your life a giant doesn't just show up knocking on your door one day but there's a process that leads to Goliath there's a process that leads to the giant are you with me this morning there's a process that he moves to before he comes to Goliath now notice this principle Jesus says this when you pray be not like the hypocrite who goes into the city makes their arms in public but you enter your secret closet notice this principle enter your secret closet and shut the door shut the world out shut the atmosphere of Lady Asiya out and he says and pray in secret and what you have done in secret your father will reward you openly publicly so David's life does not happen upon one day he stumbles upon a giant and neither does the giant suddenly show up in your life and challenges your home and challenges your kids and challenges your job and challenges your marriage listen we have goliaths that we're facing today and they're challenging your home and they're challenging your job they're challenging your testimony they're challenging what you believe and what your convictions are the question is are you willing to fight but this giant doesn't just show up one day but notice when nobody's watching when nobody's there when nobody's with David when he's all alone an African lion comes out of the woods and the Bible says that David slays the lion and it says there was another time that a bear comes out and David says with my bare hands I slew this bear that was coming to attack God's sheep but notice nobody's there to watch nobody's there to pat him on the back nobody's there to pray for him nobody's there to encourage him no pastor or minister is around to give him advice but God has chosen this battle to be all by himself he's all alone nobody's there you imagine this was David as he comes before Saul and David says I was in the field one day Saul and he said in the lion came out to devour God's sheep and I slew the lion with my hands and there was another time in my life that a bear attacked and I fought with this bear you imagine if I came here this morning and brother Louis singing and singing and singing it turns out 30 40 50 minutes his brother Matt here is he here yet and I show up late and finally I come out of the door oh I'm so sorry for being so late Church now I apologize if y'all don't forgive me you'll never believe what happened I stopped over here at the gate the circle-k down here to get gas and a pumping gas on my way to church was gonna be there on time and all of the sudden out of nowhere a lion comes out and he was gonna attack my family and I grabbed him by the neck and and I broke his jaw and then then if that wasn't enough a bear a black bear comes out of the woods and I put him in a chokehold and I body slam me and I grabbed his jaws and snapped him and that's why I'm late you'll forgive me now turn to your Bible you always think two things I'm a liar an idiot or insane but you see God chooses this battleground when nobody's watching when nobody's there when it's all in private when nobody's there to pat him on the back when nobody's there to pray for him David is slaying lions in his private life because there's time in a day when Goliath is gonna challenge his public life you see private victory equals public reward private victory equals public success and David could say with faith the same God who delivered me out of the hand of the lion and the bear shall also deliver me out of the hands of this uncircumcised Philistine you see when your life has been going through a private life and private victory and private battles the lion comes first and the bear comes next and then comes Goliath you see private success equals public victory but I got bad news I got bad news just like private success equals public victory private defeat equals public disgrace you see a person doesn't fall too Goliath one day and you hear about him falling to sin some horrible thing you think my goodness sister such-and-such brother such-and-such how could such a thing happen you see what you didn't see was the line of lust that was consuming that man what you didn't see is the Lion of temptation and the bear of temptation that was feasting on his mind and now Goliath comes and wipes him out private defeat equals public disgrace David finds this out the hard way listen David comes to battle notice this in chat invert chapter 11 verse 2 look in your Bible it came to pass in an evening tide that David will let's back up to verse 1 came to past year was expired at the time when Kings go forth to battle David sent Joab and his servants with him and all Israel and they destroyed the children of Amon it's so amazing to me that at the season of war not at the season of peace but at the time when a battle is taking place at a time when the enemy has rushed in like a flood at the time when the enemy is onslaught in attacking the home is the very time that the King says austell y'all go ahead without me I'm just going to stay here it amazes me and I wrote this down under inspiration at a time when dads go to battle at a time when moms go to battle at a time when a church goes to battle time when preachers go to battle at a time when Christians hold a standard in this world it's a time of battle friend listen it's so amazing to me that at the very time you watch a family and a family loves God it serves gods on fire for God when the kids are small but suddenly the kids become teenagers and now they need a king now they need a spiritual father now they need a strong man now they need a dad who will hold a conviction now they need a dad who won't bend and who won't bow to this pressure now they need a church that holds the banner of Jesus Christ it's this very time when usually mom and dad get schooled church gets cold we begin to get empathetic sympathetic to this world and at the very time that parents that children need a strong King listen a king is more important than just being there it's more than just the image but he's there to pray for his troops he's there to encourage them he's there to keep them around listen your children don't need a judge they don't need a critic are you here this morning they don't need criticism and skepticism they need a king a real man a real woman that will stand with them they don't say I'm praying for you the sadness is there's such a disconnect in the home children feel like they can't talk to the dad wife feels like she can't talk to the husband and the lion and bear waiting David decides to stay home listen he's not there to write Psalms David's not staying home to study the Holy Writ he's not there to get more spiritual you know what David's staying home for to sleep he's just downright lazy that's what your Bible says he stays home and stays in bed and it's so amazing to me this one mistake calls David so much do you want to know who pays for this mistake you want to know who pays when mom and dad earned at war when mom and dad are not on the battlefield you want to know who pays and suffers his children his children suffer at the hand of his own laziness and it's so amazing to me that David is fighting Eamon in chapter 10 and we come to chapter 11 and he's still fighting Eamon because he doesn't finish Eamon off and now because of his failure to fight amon look at what happens to his kids and do you want to know something amazing you've heard of a God in the Bible and Amon is who made this God have a place because it was a man's God the god of Moloch Moloch the child killing God the family destroying God the child consuming Moloch they would take their firstborn and throw their baby to the flames and because David fells to battle the system to battle the lady of seeing atmosphere because David sells to pray for his kids because David fells to hold a standard in his home are you here this morning church because david fails to go to battle on behalf of his family now the god of Amon mullah look what happens he loses kids they look quiet now y'all are gonna be quite as a mouse when we get done notice this he doesn't stay there to meditate on the law of Moses he doesn't say there how many Psalms do you think David wrote from this penthouse Castle David only starts writing Psalms again after he falls and sees his own pride in arrogance that's when David starts right in Psalms again David's in this great castle he can see everything look at verse 2 came to pass in an evening tide that David arose from off his bed you know what you want to know when the Bible says an evening tide is about 3 a.m. about 3 o'clock in the morning David's alarm a 3 a.m. hole perfect time to get out of bed when normal people are asleep listen I know God can wake you up at 3 a.m. to pray have somebody on your heart maybe you're up because of circumstances but normal people are not up every night at 3 a.m. prophet of God says evil spirits come out late don't stay out late does this church still believe that david wakes up in the middle of the night he's getting up notice this habit in his life staying up til all hours of the night Bible says he woke up in an evening tide David arose walked upon the roof of the king's house and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman was very beautiful to look upon you'll notice we don't know what he's seen there's no sins taking place yet that we know of David could have accidentally seen something listen you can't only stop what you see but you can't turn your head prophet said you can't stop birds from flying over but you can sure stop them from building a nest before a man you can search stop them from stopping and the Bible says he sees a woman now notice this in verse 4 David sent message and I'm sorry verse 3 and David sent and inquired after the woman no notice nothing's wrong yet because in those days if she's eligible he can have her right the Bible says he took he sent servants and inquired and one said verse three is this not Bathsheba the daughter of Eliam the wife the wife of Uriah the Hittite it should have stopped there [Music] you see there's always a temptation the Bible says he'll never tempt you above that which you can be tempted but with that temptation he makes a way of escape exit leave now run for your life but it doesn't stop there Bible says he took her and she laid with him verse 5 the woman conceived and sit and told David I am with child no notice this is so amazing how much different this life is than the David before this man David has riches he has everything he can need he doesn't worry about bills he doesn't worry about food he doesn't worry about a job no anxiety no stress no worry no pain best doctors best car best house and we say man I would like to be that David I'd like to be that man who just has everything notice prosperity often is very dangerous I'll ask you a question what David would you rather be the David that has no bills to worry about hey that sounds good can I get an amen anybody man never worry about bills again never worry about money really and not play the lottery I II mean I can get by with this all the prosperity and no worry no bills no anxiety oh how I wish I had no stress in my life it's amazing what we pray sometimes Oh God take away the stress Lord oh if I just had a piece oh if I could just get to the place where I had 10 grand in the bank didn't have to worry about nothing and no bills and all if I can just get to the place where I was always ahead had a little bit of extra money Oh mom I'm the only one I've ever prayed that huh [Applause] if I could ever get to that place David was at this place now would you pick that David or would you pick this David [Music] have y'all seen so hey is anybody seen him I haven't got sleep for four nights I've been watching for him ducking and diving I've been fearful for my life hidin behind rocks sleeping in the woods stress anxiety worry waking up in the middle of the night how am I ever gonna get by where to get killed which David would you rather be but let me tell you something the most carnal corrupt sinful David was the David who lived in the castle and the most spiritual fervent zealous man was the man David who had stress and worry and pain listen your trials are sent for a reason God knows best he puts worrying trials and anxiety for a reason Church you should thank him and praise Him this morning this David listen when do you think he wrote Psalms the most blessed book and some of our favorite books in the Bible or the Psalms you think these Psalms were written when David was kicked back on a couch but these Psalms that we love so much were written out of the darkest hours [Music] hallelujah Oh friend I don't know about you that gives me courage that gives me joy to know that my trouble is for a reason my pain is for a reason hallelujah the trials God sends my way the Bible says the trial of your faith is much more precious than that of gold hallelujah hallelujah blessed be his name David's trials his strength is found in his weakness but no one say when he is tempted I am tempted of God for God cannot be tempted nor does he tempt any man but when we are tempted listen when each one of us is tempted when he is carried away with his own lust and when lust has conceived it brings forth sin and sin brings forth death David sins snowballs David's sin gets to a place to where it starts out so small it starts out so little but a sin begins to snowballs and get out of control David find some place it finds to a place to where he killed Lee comes from adultery then it leads to murder because listen sin does not stay the same sin grows you tell a lie you'll tell a bigger lie you tell a bigger lie you'll tell a bigger lie if you start out with dishonesty you'll end up with more dishonesty I believe a Christian should be the most honest person I believe a Christian should be the most honest transparent open nothing to hide person the problem is as so many people's prides got in the way it's led them to the closet of sin we think we're something so we can't come up for prayer because we're a preacher we think we're something cuz we're a deacon or a Tsar that this side of the other musician or a song leader something in the church you see pride gets in the way the devil wants to do one thing to you it's to bury you in condemnation it's to bury you and guilt listen God has a job for you to do and you can't do the job when you're burdened with your own mistakes Christ came to set you free freedom hallelujah to free us from the guilt of sin hallelujah he came to give us liberty not condemnation and guilt if you're under the weight of sin this morning if you're under the weight of guilt this morning I'll give you a scripture he who the Sun sets free is free indeed he's free from everything he's free from the guilt of his past hallelujah he's free from the guilt of his consciousness David's sin begins to grow out of control notice this turn to psalms chapter 32 we won't be much longer sums chapter 32 notice this this is David now listen from the outside everything seems normal David's conducting business he's moving about the city everything seems good everything seems fine he's meeting greeting shaking people's hands all brother David oh what a good brother little does everyone know David's about to tell you what was behind that smile David says in verse three when I kept silence in other words when I didn't confess when I didn't come clean what I didn't expose myself my bones he says my bones waxed old I was like an old man but a young man my bones hurt I ain't listen sin affects your health secret sin affects your health David says my bones waxed old through my roaring oh the day long my hand was heavy upon me he says for day and night my hand was heavy upon me my moisture my tears my sincerity my passion that I used to have and I used to cry and I used to raise my hands and tears would fall when I heard about Jesus and his amazing grace now my moisture is turning to the droughts of summer imagine this is the man who looks so good but down on the inside this empty what a miserable place to be in what a misery David had in his life he says I kept silent my bones waxed old through my roaring so David tells us very clearly sin hurts sin destroys sin breaks you captive it puts chains on your life chains in your mind you become eventually like that man legion eventually his sin pushed him to death eventually it pushed him to the graveyard David's sin begins to hurt him he's losing sleep he can't sleep he's losing weight he's pal all because of unconfessed sin all because he's failed to discern the season in an area of his life and now he's a casualty I hope so bad that you catch my pretty what I'm trying to preach to you this morning I'm trying to tell you you're not in the time of peace you're in the time of war and you better wake up and take your armor take your sword you better wake up Church you better be ready to fight this battle you better be ready not to lay down not to sleep not to get tired but to say bring me to this battle Lord teach my hands to war for my adversary it's like a lion seeking whom he may devour people are getting cold and falling asleep because they've not realized that you're in a vicious vicious war are you ready to fight Church are you ready to say I'm not gonna give up I'm not gonna quit Satan I'm here with my sword and with faith in God's Word they can do anything for me for greater is He that's in me but he sits in the world hallelujah David comes to a place and his life is so far gone but you know what this man who is losing sleep this man who was broken this man who couldn't sing God's praises he couldn't lift his hands this outward appearance is the greatest sign of God's mercy you know humanly we look at that and we think how could God do that but this was the greatest gift of Mercy because God said those who I love I rebuke and chasten God loved him more God loved him so much he wouldn't let him get away hallelujah God's hand can reach further than your lowest mistake hallelujah he can run farther and faster and you can't get away from the merciful God you can't get away from the loving hand of Correction and I'm so thankful for that David's life is under the greatest hand of judgment but a great hand of mercy daddy's hands soft and kind when we done right daddy's hands hard as steel when we've done wrong listen God's tenderizing this man David little does anyone know God's tender mercy is upon his life and you know what God's tenderizing him for correction I didn't say yelling and screaming and condemnation you see correction isn't yelling and screaming and condemnation correction is to correct your way your life starts going this way God corrects it and turns it around and God's about to send a man and David's life a man who loved David a man who loved him had great respect for him had known him for years he was an employee of David's turned to second Samuel Chapter 12 quickly if we could don't you love God this morning 2nd Samuel 12 notice this God since a man who loves David a man who's watched David for years a man who has respect a prophet of God a servant of God and God sends this man to David Nathan a real servant of God a real true vessel of God and no doubt when David when God reveals this to Nathan and he shows him everything that's happened no doubt Nathan's hearts broken no doubt he says David hello David how could you David how could you let your life get so out of control David how could you take such mercy and such grace that God's had owned you how could you allow this to happen it's what happens to me friend when I read about this man David and I say old David if he would have just gone to war David if you would have just fought for the sake of your family for the sake of your children man fight it's not a time to lay down it's a time to fight I hope I inspire you this morning it's not a time to lay down it's a time for preachers not to compromise it's a time to fight for the gospel of Jesus Christ it's a time to take a strong conviction and strong stand in the Word of God everyone's caving in under the pressure oh that's me you know the message is a little bit hard it's a little bit harsh and maybe we should change this and edit this and change this and don't preach that too hard you know we can't preach that 2012 now and that was back then in the 80s and 90s that was good but you know just compromise all we don't need to preach so much about that and you know about how you live people are caving in over the pressure but I'm here to tell you this morning I'm here to stay at my post of duty I'm here to take a sword to saddle a horse and to go to war and charge how do you charge in the battle you should thank God for a ministry that stands and tells you the truth those who love you the most will tell you the most truth the false prophets one who tells you lies tells you what you want to hear Nathan no doubt shaking as he comes to church that mornin listen I don't believe for one minute that Nathan walked in there and said oh if there's my opportunity I got asked to preach tonight I'm gonna wear that I'm gonna beat him oh I can't wait I can't wait I'm gonna make the meanest face dr. mink you see a servant of God can have a hundred percent truth and 100 percent the wrong attitude and it helps nobody Oh trust me I'm not saying you don't raise your voice I'm not saying there is a spiritual indignation there is religious indignation and we should say it with with with passion we should say it with conviction but make sure you say it with love love is the only thing that God can operate through I don't believe he kicked the door down and said come here David but I believe a real servant of God when he sees the sins of the street the Bible says he sighs and crowd [Applause] you believe that church I believe Nathan's head was shaken as he turned the knob to go to church god help me oh lord help me well if I lose my job what if he never talks to me he came what if he doesn't want anything to do with me you see but you must understand something Nathan was a servant of God before a friend to David hallelujah he was faithful to God before he was faithful to a man a real servant of God cares only for one man's approval the man Christ Jesus hallelujah you think I wanted to come here to Happy Valley to this church and preach this out of all the things the Word of God can preach listen this word is good anything you could preach would be good but a real servant stays with what God tells him Nathan opens the door notice verse 1 of chapter 12 Nathan came to pass the God the Lord said Nathan unto David and he came unto him and said unto him notice this story he tells there were two men in one city the one rich and the other poor the rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds but the poor man had nothing notice what's in Nathan's mind he picks his story very carefully as he thinks of David and Bathsheba and Uriah the poor man had nothing save one little ewe lamb which said but he had bought and nourished up and it grew up together with him and with his children it did eat of his own meat and drank of his own cup and laying his bosom and was under him as a daughter what picture does Nate does Nathan paint David you didn't break up a home that was ready to be broke up but you took a family that was closely knit together and your sinful nature has destroyed and broken something so precious notice verse 4 and there came a traveller into the rich man and he spared to take of his own and of his own herd to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto Him but took the poor man's lamb and dressed it for the man that was come to him and notice what happens to David as he's hearing this story and Davis anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to Nathan as the Lord liveth the man that has done this thing shall surely die [Music] it's amazing how fast we pass judgment and it's amazing how quick God will make you look so stupid is that true it's amazing how fast people with small children will criticize families with teenagers trust me I've kept my mouth zipped it's amazing how fast we criticize and we tear down hey yud amazing what people are posted on Facebook like brother Bernie Williams says it should be called to Facebook hey man [Applause] it's so fast how quickly we criticize we've watched a brother and maybe we hear about something that he's falling into her some sister some teenager how could they they ain't got the Holy Ghost a and born-again pastor needs to preach on them it's so amazing to me how quickly we forget it I don't know about you friend but it took so much Grace and so much overlooking and so much long-suffering just reach me how could I criticize or tear down there's someone who's struggling how dare you how dare you criticize a person a young person at that I watch people say yeah young people and if you ask a young person to say they this and look at the lifes of the people and look at this yet they've never not once went to that young person to pray for them to encourage them to help them but they're the first to run their mouth whatsoever it's okay God won't be mocked whatsoever you sow you shall also reap for jesus said by thy words thou are justified or condemned and with what judgment you meet it shall also be meted unto you is that okay [Music] amen David so quickly criticizes this man shall surely die notice this look at your Bible verse 5 David's anger was greatly kindled he said underneath it as the Lord liveth the man that has done this thing shall surely die and he shall restore the lamb now notice David has no clue he's passing his own sentence he has no idea he's the judge in his own driver notice verse 6 and he shall restore the Lambs for David has no clue but it's going to cost him four Lambs he's gonna lose Absalom he's gonna lose Eamon he's gonna lose a donor's eye and Bathsheba's son who paid who suffered who bore the consequence of a father and mother who decide to stay at home who pays he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he has done this thing and because he had no pity Nathan said to David I know when you came to church and that preacher was preaching you thought it was him and him and her and her and Oh God had put it on him Lord let him hear Lord I know you had on your mind that person in that person and I know when you thought when he was preaching he was talking about this and that and human her but no it was sure it was you imagine how quickly David's anger settles me Lord it's me thou art the man thus saith the Lord God of Israel i anointed the king over Israel and delivered thee out of the hand of Saul and I gave thee thy masters house and thy masters wives on that bosom and gave me the house of Israel and of Judah and if that had been too little I would have moreover have given unto thee such and such things wherefore has now despised the commandment of the Lord to do evil in a site that was killed Uriah the Hittite hey wait a minute you mean he wasn't even an Israelite but he was actually a hittite a nation who God told the children of Israel to destroy you see he was a proselyte I hope you're hearing me this morning he wasn't even a part of the bloodline but yet God's attitude towards humanity it's so amazing how quick our arrogant elitist attitude has caused people to leave this message we criticize but what have you learned is that okay to say we judge but what have you learned you know people get disgusted because they hear so much about I I and how good I am they see the elitist attitude that comes in the message and the arrogance that we look down on other people all they go to this church over there and their two serpents eat yet God is going to judge David's entire house because he killed a knight you know what people leave you know what they're crying out for more of Christ because we've preached so much of doctrine without Christ people fail to realize the message is not doctrine and paints and books and teaching it's a person his name is Jesus Christ hallelujah he said if I be lifted up I'll draw all men unto me I want to lift up Christ hallelujah a message didn't change you books and tapes didn't change you the inspiration of Jesus Christ on letter form and book form and preaching form has transformed my life hallelujah thank you Jesus you have killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword notice this look in your Bible verse 9 and it's taken his wife to be thy wife and slaying them with the sword of the children of Amon now therefore the sword now therefore your bride and have a go for it it was wrong David but man come on please don't do that again just going just know what I'll find out is that God's attitude no because that was done this the sword shall never depart from thine house because that was despised me and taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite notice the emphasis Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife thus saith the Lord I will raise her people against me out of thine own house verse 12 notice our principle in verse 12 for thou did it say it again for thou did it secretly but private failure is going to equal public disgrace for thou did it secretly but I will do this thing before the whole church before all Israel and before the son you say that's so horrible now how could God a loving God ever do this you know how because God gave David a chance to repent he gives the woman in the harlot in the Book of Revelations I gave her a space a space to repent and she repented not notice friend God gave David a chance he gave him a chance to come clean he gave him a chance to expose his own self he gave him a chance to take his pride and lay it down but because David chose not to now God is going to humiliate him to Humble him David said unto Nathan I have sinned against the Lord Nathan said unto David the Lord also has put away thy sin thou shalt not die howbeit because by this deed thou has given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme the child also that is born unto the easterly died so does three others his children suffers for his own lack of discerning the season he was in and people today are felling to discern they're not just meandering you're not just living life but invisibly through out eyes that you can maybe can't see yours you can't hear there is a war that's waging he wants your children he wants your mind he wants your home but the Bible says when the enemy comes rushing in like a flood the family of God raises up a wall they raise up a standard against you David's life I want to close here in just a minute can you give me about five or ten more minutes turn to Psalms 51 if you could quickly close on this here Psalms 51 I want you to think for just a minute if you were to be a fly on the wall and be there in the room that day when Nathan comes and confronts and exposes David watch David's attitude I'm about to show you what is so lacking in so many people's lives and what so many people have never came to it's real simple but it's foreign to us it's called repentance people question the word and they question the Holy Ghost because they come up and get prayed for sin or something out of their life only to go the next week and the fall and the same exact it and they begin to question Satan begins to get them to question God and His Word and the Holy Spirit listen that's not the problem the problem is most people have never repented notice this in Psalms 51 this is the prayer David prays notice not arrogance he doesn't say how dare you expose me in front of all these people but notice David drops to his knees and then watch you're there on the room watch what David prays have mercy upon me O God according to thy loving-kindness according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me against thee only have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judgest behold I was shaped in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me behold thou desirest truth in the inward notice David doesn't say for thou desirest a dress code for thou desirous long dresses a long hair and no makeup no shorts and no smoking no drinking that's what you want Lord know that what God wants those attributes to be fueled from something that's happened he says fourth Alice and in the inward parts that will make me to know wisdom purge me with hyssop oh I don't have time to go through all these words he says purge me with hyssop that I may be clean says personally of hyssop and I shall be clean wash me and I will be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken you see the greatest gift of mercy God could ever do to you is to break you break me yes for God to crush you under the hand of his mercy David says that I make her joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken may rejoice notice this hide thy face for my sins and blot out mine iniquities create in me a clean heart you know what you realize when you read this whole Psalm David wasn't saying a poem he wasn't reciting the prayer listen repentance is not a prayer that you pray it's not coming up here that may be fine that may be what you need but repentance real real repentance is a cry of desperation and it's a heart that says I'm so sick of myself in an age that says men shall be lovers of their own self I say I hate myself wretched man am I who shall deliver me from the body but the bondage of this dead Paul says notice this prayer is not a poem it's a prayer and a cry I imagine if you were there David wouldn't be talking he'd be yelling create in me a clean heart Oh God notice the word that he chooses create in other words this is something I can't do hallelujah he says but the hell creator of heavens and earth you have to do this David reminds God I'm born in sin I'm shaped in iniquity so great creator create something that's not there create in me a clean heart and renew a right spirit can you be honest enough to say the spirit of head Lord he's not right he says renew the right spirit within me cast me not away what language is this then he uses cast me not away oh disconnect yourself from the song in the tradition focus on these words cast me not away from thy presence David is speaking out of fear and terror because David told us there's only one thing he's ever wanted in his life not money not jobs not popularity not fame there's only one thing I've asked of you God more than anything the deepest part of my heart is I want to dwell in the presence of God and now David realizes the very thing he's prayed for could be taken away and David's fearful cast me not away from that presence you know why because his David prays this prayer David suddenly awoke and he realizes here am i and I'm a king there's so there's there's the prophet Nathan a king of profit and this prophets coming to me for correction and Here I am and I remember watching another King and another prophet a king named Saul and a prophet named Samuel imagined his memories going back and he's remembering there was God and God sent Samuel time and time again was sermon after sermon after sermon and then saw sat in his seat folded his arms and said I'm sorry Lord forgive me Jesus Oh Lord forgive me of my sins oh the preacher said raise your hand if you want to reach out and and confess that this service is bless you today does raise your hands there's my hands Lord he watched Saul's half-hearted half-baked repentance as he watched Saul after he'd always say O Lord the people all the people me and Israel he'd never confess it for himself and he watched Saul's half-hearted repentance as correction came but change never arrived and he watched Saul continue and continue and continue in so much that finally God says I repent that I made this man King and David remembers there was so after he thought he could get away and now I remember her Saul before the Witch of Endor and saw makes a confession I prayed but the Lord doesn't hear me he has departed the Holy Spirit has departed and now you know why David prayed cast please don't do that to me Lord don't take your Holy Spirit David begins to realize if God did it to him he could do it to me and he says cast me not away from my presence take not thy Holy Spirit restore unto me the joy of restoration the joy of that salvation I'm here to tell you where there's real repentance there is restoration hallelujah where there's of genuine turning brother Branham said what do you do when you repent you turn around and you go the other way he says you go towards Calvary David says restore and tell me the joy of my salvation and he says and uphold me up another words Lord I'm falling I'm falling I can't hold myself up anymore you ever felt like that friend David says hold me Lord hold me with thy free spirit and he says uphold me then I will teach transgressors thy ways and sinners will be converted in other words I'm gonna take a life of many mistakes I'm gonna take a life of many failures and I'm not gonna glorify Satan I'm not gonna give him glory I'm not gonna stay down and stay depressed because of my deceit because of my pain of my failure but I'm gonna turn a failure into a great testimony hallelujah and sinners will repent because of you who because of the power of God hallelujah sinners will be converted because they seem God could take a man that made such mistakes but could still receive mercy this God is unfathomable is unsearchable Lord deliver me from blood-guiltiness O God thou God of my salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness o Lord open thou my lips and my mouth shall show forth thy praise for thou desirous not sacrifice or I would have given it they'll delight us not in burnt offerings the sacrifices of God are not prayers and pretty prayers and oh I'm so sorry I know forgive me but the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit a contrite heart O God thou will not despise me let's stand to our feet this morning musicians can return this morning David finds what I fear so many people have never found David finds repentance brother branham says this such a wonderful quote he says David after he had taken your eye his wife the hittite the lovely Bathsheba was going to be the father of her child caused her gallant husband to be killed in battle but when the prophet Nathan come in and revealed his sins to him then David thought on his ways and he turned himself turned himself to repentance in sackcloth and ashes that's the way to turn God will God hurt him God will always hear a man a woman that'll turn their feet to his testimony it's amazing to me the prophet of God tells a lie and he goes to pray for someone and the Lord convicts him and says make that right just a little lie something so small prophet of God goes and makes it right you see most of us will do what he did we'll go and make it right but read the rest of the story brother Branham said after that I went to greens mill to my cave and fasted and pray for days you know why he was repenting you said brother Matt does that mean we need to do something great and oh my just feel all sad and again now turmoil for three weeks no that's not what I'm saying I'm simply saying this make sure your repentance is not a prayer but it's a turning it's a turning of self by your heads with me this morning play something for me brothers Jesus comes to a man and I'd like to tell you this story he comes to a man in the Bible at the Pool of Bethesda and Jesus comes to this man a man who had been there for thirty plus years he had came to this church with the same disease you want to know what put him there in that Matt on his Li on his back it wasn't unfortunate circumstances but the Bible tells us sin in his life had put him there for 30 years he laid on his bed and Jesus comes to him and says sir will thou be made whole every head bowed please every eye closed will thou be made whole man begins to tell us stories oh I've been here and every time an angel comes and stirs the waters I have no man to lift me to put me in the water oh I've been coming to this church for years and I've prayed and prayed and prayed and prayed and prayed it's not ever gonna hear my prayer it's not ever gonna hear me you notice God does not ask questions for nothing this man has been in this crippled state and Jesus asks him a question this is what he asked do you want to be made whole now of course the man could say of course what do you think you think I like being in this condition you think it pleases me to be on this floor on the hard concrete but Jesus ain't asking a senseless question you see Jesus doesn't care about the pain that sin has caused this man he doesn't care and he's not interested and all the hurt and all the wreckage and all the chaos that this man's sin we don't know what it was maybe alcohol pornography drugs adultery we don't know what it was you see most people cannot stand the pain that their sin causes them and they get sorrowful because of all the pain and they say all these drugs wrecked my home the alcohol messes me up all these pain from all the sin and most people have sorrow for the result of their sin and they think because they're sorrowful over the pain that somehow when they ask God to cleanse them that they've repented but you see God's not interested in the pain that it's causing you that's not why he transforms you God doesn't want to know do you hate the pain that sin causes God wants to know do you hate the sin because you live in an age that the Bible says men will be lovers of their own self they will want to please themselves and their own passions that want to please their own desires and so much that they'll pay any price to please number one and Jesus is asking you a question here this morning will you be made I want to ask you with every head bowed every eye closed as Jesus is here this morning we've preached a sermon about David so much more we could have said but we look at a man's life who made such a bad choice and cost him so much so much that I can't even say some of the things that happen he eventually gets kicked out of his own Kingdom rejected he's kicked out but David that's not that that's not the end of the story hallelujah David finds the place of real repentance real sorrowful Ness real sackcloth and ashes you know why they put sackcloth on it was made of goat's hair it hurt they would wear it for days and it would itch their body then they would take ashes and pour it all over their body you know why asked his represented total death of no resurrection and no return and that's what we need this morning we need to die so much to ourselves but we say Oh God don't never let me return and resurrect the old man but the Bible says he who walks after the spirit lives not after the things of the flesh I want to ask you this morning sir ma'am teenager will you be made maybe you're here this morning and you've realized you've been in Jerusalem when the battles taking place and you want to say Lord I'm reporting for duty this morning raise a hand and say Oh God inspire me to war teach my hands to war don't let me phone into the cave into the pressure and the circumstance of this age it's perilous times I'm living in and I need to know that I have a God
