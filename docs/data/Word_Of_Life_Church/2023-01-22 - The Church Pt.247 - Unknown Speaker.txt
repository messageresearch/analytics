welcome to Holiday Inn who knows this might be our last Sunday here my goodness I figured somebody would say Glory or something praise the Lord I appreciate us being able to have this place though thankful for it this book in Proverbs chapter 31 if you would today verse 10. greet you today in the name of the Lord it's truly a great privilege for us to be together I know we say it a lot but I said a lot because I mean it it's a true privilege for us to be able to assembled together Proverbs chapter 31 verse 10 we'll read them through verses 12. who can find a virtuous woman for her prices far above rubies the heart of her husband death safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil what a great testimony she will do him good and not evil all the days our life let's bow our heads together ask the Lord to help us today Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace and mercy to us today we thank you Lord Jesus that we've been having the opportunity to assemble here we're grateful we pray that you bless the Holiday Inn the staff managers for their kindness to his Lord we're asking today that you would help us in this service father that you had speak to us and you know every one of our needs you're the only one that can take this service and fit it in such a way that every Hungry Heart would be ministered to the sick and body the weary in spirit maybe it'll people lost something in the Holy Ghost some and their home financially whatever their needs would be we bring our petitions before you today and we ask you that you would help us pray for our brothers and sisters around the world dear God be mindful of your people today help me that I can get out of the way speak through me the words of life I pray father in the name of the Lord Jesus amen God bless you may be seated considering that this is wrote about a woman like Bathsheba which is not very well thought of amongst Many religious ranks it makes it quite outstanding that Solomon would write such words about his mother a woman with a lot of trouble a woman with a lot of issues that she had to deal with no doubt in our life as I was studying this week my mind went back to this quote been a while since I'd read it I think it sets forth the epitome really the summation of a lot of Our Lives so when the world falling apart the prophet said we want everything just so we can take it easy and retire and take life easy life was an intended to be easy and I don't know about most of you but easy apparently the PA system ain't meant to be easy to operate either as a so life wasn't intended to be easy life is a struggle anything that's got life he said is struggling look at the trees how they struggle look at everything that's got life it's a struggle but why is it that we want it easy or something about us don't we how many mothers much rather have life easier easier every day me too I mean I put up both legs if I could stand I I wish things about my life was easier I wish things about your life I wish things about just about life in general was easier but yet we have a Vindicated Prophet telling us that it was not intended to be easy so when I look at this I realize there's a portion of me that is longing for when life will be easy but it won't be now but when I look at this and I think it's no wonder that God would allow trouble and difficulty and hardships and things to come our way because you know how it is with most of us probably we go through one thing of life and we get it taken care of and thing is pretty good and then we don't get to enjoy that hardly a day or so that something else comes up and sometimes it can be even worse than what you today and with the day before disappointments and Sadness and Sorrow and sickness and trouble it's just seemed like it's one thing after another anybody that way besides me well praise the Lord I don't feel so strange then and yet when you look at this you realize that life then was not intended to be easy now I want you to listen to what he goes on to say when we try to get some type of a system that takes it easy then we are wrong wow I guarantee one thing I'm probably wrong about a lot of things but I ain't wrong about this because I've never found a system myself to where life was easy he says whenever we try to get some kind of a system that takes it easy then we're wrong and we know there's something wrong so if life was not intended to be easy then I wonder when God allows difficult times to come our way we know truly they must be for a reason and a purpose doesn't mean we enjoy it doesn't mean we like it doesn't mean that we look forward to it but yet God is able to take things that happen in our lives that can seem absolutely so destructive and so devastating that we will never get over it I'm sure there's people sitting here today and people under the sound of my voice in different parts of the world and you face things in your life and you saw there is no way I'll ever be able to get over this I'll never be the same this has scarred me this has hindered me for the rest of my life and yet you look back today and you think well I thought it did but actually it didn't so how did that turn out well God helped you with that situation but we realize that many people don't do so good with life's problems you know if you've ever studied much about serial killers and you've studied about those that come to a place to where they can take human life and not feel any remorse they don't feel any sadness they can lie they can cheat they can steal they can do all kinds of things and it's not to have no conscience at all and we truly believe we're living in a time when people's conscience is being seared with a hot iron as the scripture tells us that it would be and yet they will get to a place where they could take one life and another and another and then they become what is identified as a serial killer then they study these type of people and what I've found in looking at some of them myself is that things happen to them early on in life and maybe they were very awkward in society a lot of them the predominant ones that are serial killers are males 25 to 45. many of them drive a certain type of vehicle I'm going to tell you what kind it is they drive a certain type of vehicle and they there's certain traits about them now I find that I find that amazing to see that they live in different parts of the world and yet there's a certain demagogue about them and a certain mannerism about them most of them that will kill women they had a very hard time ever getting a girlfriend they had a very hard time ever being able to speak to women feel very comfortable being around them and it's like they're taking revenge on every woman that they kill and it's something that happened within them those of you that have been following the four murders out in Idaho and the suspect that they have in jail and all that and they begin to look at the man's life and they saw this same pattern that I just described to you he was never able to talk to girls he was always strange as some of them identified him and and did not fit in society and they begin to shape something in the mind and the life of that individual now there's no doubt in my mind there's people sitting here this morning were it not for the grace of God by some of the things that we've been through we would be worse shape than some of them people you read about in the newspaper but what makes the difference the Lord got a hold of Our Lives because you see Satan knew once he broke into the human race all he would need to do is start defiling the first few people on the Earth then they would continue to hand down that sort of saying now if you've ever really looked at it or not but I've looked at it myself quite a bit in those that molest kids and the way that it starts and it's very it's very traumatic and it can be so devastating but what I've found out for many of them a great percentage of those who will molest kids were also molested themselves and then you look back so that one who molested them was also molested so it's like it's an unending cycle that Satan started so many many years ago and all he has to do he doesn't have to come up and send his demons every year every month to start reinstigating all this evil in the human race but he starts it way back Yonder thousands of years ago and P people get in that cycle then they live out what happened to them and what's peculiar about it is most of them absolutely hate it they hate what happened to them they so despise it it wrecked their life it totally turned their life upside down and yet they turn around and become the very thing they hate I don't sit there and look at me strange but as being a pastor and counseling lots of people down through the years decades of my life that I've give to the gospel here and around the world and I've found that many people if they're not careful they will become if it's a man and he had a father that was a certain certain way what's amazing is that many of those men that they despise those certain traits about their father they turn right around become the same thing and a woman will do exactly the same thing though they hate it but it it's like it's something ingrained in them it's like they are groomed by their DNA they are groomed by the mythology and they come down and it's a method that it's over and over again and we repeat ourself and we know as human beings that we are creatures of habit and much of what we will become years later in our life we gain that influence when we are very very young so it takes something to break that cycle so some of you you may look around say well I wish I could see a miracle if you brushed your teeth this morning looked in the mirror you saw one because no telling what's in your family tree and what all kinds of strains are in your family and yet you set here today differ thank God I'm glad that I'm not what runs in my family on both sides come on they don't sit there and look at me like y'all come from a bunch of angels you did the kind that ride motorcycles not but the one with wings on their backs but they wore leather jackets and you know all them type of helmet types of things but yet we look and see that God is able to take people like us people like this that we look at like Bathsheba that was brought to the Palace against her will she appears in the first pages of scripture that we find her name and it's not with a great introduction to the king it's not with a great party this went to with her husband and she was met in some political Affair but she was met in an adulterous relationship with King David her husband is killed she's separated from her stepchildren she's forced to marry a man that she does not love David does not love her as a man should love a woman when he marries her but David just after her beauty no doubt he would have left her alone that should not come up with a child then David has to come up with a conniving evil Wicked plan to kill her husband so she loses her husband she loses her stepchildren she loses her way of life she loses all of this because one of God's Great Men fell into sin praise the Lord but remember God had already made an Everlasting Covenant with David and he said from the fruit of thy body well I set upon thy Throne so David's sin could never even break that Covenant but God made I'm glad God's got one like that with a bride too but it doesn't mean that David doing wrong he did not reap greatly and he would for the rest of his life and so did Bathsheba but before we go into her a little bit more let's look into a another woman in the Bible that we're all very familiar with we don't know her name apparently it's not significant but she was the woman at the well and we all know that this woman was a very famous woman Jesus spoke things to her he hadn't even spoken to his disciples he shared things about himself to this woman and she was the first one to even know about it and their meeting was quite unusual it's a connecting time Saint John 4 chapter 6 verse 6 rather now Jacob's Well was there and Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey set thus on the well and it was about the the sixth hour and there was come a woman of Samaria to draw water Jesus saith unto her give me to drain now to save time will jump down to verse 15. the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come hitherto draw Jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither now notice go call thy husband the woman answered and said I have no husband Jesus said unto her thouest well said I have no husband thou Hast had five husbands and he whom thou has thou Hast is not thy husband so she's living with a man most of us will not even speak to this woman we wouldn't want our great reputation to be tainted but Jesus reputation is made among this type of people I hope we never get so goody goody that we can't reach out to this type of people now notice in verse 19 then the woman says unto him sir I perceive that thou art a prophet now myself reading the Bible since a little boy I never understood this scripture I never understood why Jesus said what he said and I never understood why I went the direction that he went until I came to the message and then one which was a window into the realm of the supernatural actually opened to us for the first time what Jesus actually did Paul never mentioned what Jesus was doing Peter never mentioned it none of the rest of the New Testament writers have I ever found ever actually mentioned what Jesus did but what Jesus was doing was contacting This Woman's Spirit not her soul not her body now listen what the prophet says about this when you go to a person that's when the vision starts and you contact their Spirit like Jesus talking to the woman at the well he contacted her spirit and then the vision takes place again he says she said well our fathers Worship in this mountain and you say in Jerusalem and the conversation went on at length now he says now you have to take my word for this right here or this part he was contacting her spirit the father had sent him there but he didn't know yet what was going to take place so Jesus goes by the leading of the father living in his body but the father did not tell him what he's going to do so Jesus is just led by the spirit and he goes up to the Wilderness or to the water rather and he comes out of the Wilderness and comes up to the Samaria which the disciples were totally uncomfortable even going to because they had no dealings with one another so he's there and he's just kind of waiting around now can you imagine the Lord Jesus not even knowing for sure what yet to do so he waits and he waits and the woman comes out and he figures it must be something to do with her so he starts talking to her now as he talks he's trying to contact the communication channel of her being now think of it why didn't he contact her soul you realize your soul has no memory your soul has no conscience your soul is not the contact Communication channel by which your faults and your past can be found the soul of a child of God that has once been redeemed no longer holds the memory of your past oh that'll make us all happy so the prophet if a person would come up and contact their soul the soul would have no information to disclose about the scars of the past you follow me so far so the Lord Jesus now he doesn't know what to do and he knows that he's been sent there for a purpose so he starts talking to the woman and uh you know uh bring me a train let's start time I'm a little bit thirsty so would you would you care to bring me a drink oh I'm terrible looking at you you're a Jew y'all don't have no demons with us we're Samaritans and since then he goes on like that and he says okay well go get your husband and we'll we'll talk about him well I don't have a husband but by now he has contacted her channel of communication now the spirit has imagination conscience memory reason and affection so he's contacted the communication channel of her being why does he need that for he needs to find what's stored in her past he needs to find what hurts are stored and where are they stored in her spirit you see I hope you understand I'm not trying to belittle anyone any any brothers uh in the message that mainly emphasize Divine Healing of the body I'm not trying to even downplay those that don't really believe in prayer lines you say we've got people in the message that don't we do yeah we do but I also think that there's that other realm that Realm of the spirit now let me say this I I'm not a prophet uh we're not looking for another Prophet myself I'm not sure you all are I'm not looking for another Gentile Prophet because there's no promise in the scripture for one and I don't believe that we need a prophet to be able to come and discern this and that and the other in our spirit but I still believe that the word is a discerner and the word can be able to go in and divide and separate the soul from the spirit and even the spirit from the body to be able to get people into the light of God the to microscope of God can fall upon their wounded part and help them get healing shouldn't we all want that for for ourselves and for each other well whenever Jesus then contacts this woman he contacts the communication channel of her being now the prophet said that he contacted her spirit and when he finally contacted the woman's Spirit he went right straight to her trouble so her trouble even though her body was acting out this lifestyle her body was acting out all these different husbands and she was a very Wicked Woman when it come to sexual impurity but yet the trouble was not actually in her body now listen to me but the trouble laid of course in the soul and the Soul controls the spirit and the spirit controls the body but the soul Jesus didn't contact it because the soul does not contain memory so the soul does not contain imagination thank God for the human Spirit do you understand when people go out of their mind you know what happens to them now sometimes it can be brain cells it can be brain matter it can be the dark matter can be different things and the mind itself it's if it's a physical thing but if a person goes insane and it is a spiritual Insanity something happens in their Spirit remember the twin girls and the prophet talked about one of them could take the stress and the trouble of life and the other one couldn't and she lost her mind so he goes to talk to her goes into the insane place and when he goes in there he gives another example of another lady as well very similar and whenever he goes in there he talks to the girl and he says you know you wanted to be a preacher's wife you want it and a smile come on her face it broke change their spirit so he said he had to go out and bring that girl's Spirit back into her body she didn't know who she was she didn't know who her parents was so her soul was there it was not because something had happened into her mind that she had a stroke and something that damaged her brain but she was insane because her spirit had took a journey into another world so the prophet goes out and catches that spirit and brings it back once her human Spirit come back into her body why of course she would remember who she was why because memory lays in the spirit you understand why the world that the prophet would declare the world is going insane so they don't know what is right and wrong well word is rhymed in wrong way the ability to know that in your conscience which is in your spirit so if the world goes crazy insane and their Spirit roaming out there in the Nether world wherever it is will they not come to a spot they will not know what right is what wrong is they won't know who's a man who's a Woman They want no black white red yellow they will know anything so then for us to talk to them and they will have no wrong as I read the other day this suspect as I mentioned to you about a while ago that the man looking back at some of the posts that the man had said about himself that he could do anything and could say anything and felt no wrong felt no shame whatever he said whatever he did well that shows you that there's something not just physically wrong with that individual but the spirit itself is roaming out there somewhere because the conscience is no longer there if you've got a good conscious day you ought to be thanking God if you say something wrong and it bothers you you ought to thank God if you do something wrong even think something wrong it bothers you that means you still got a spirit don't send it away now noticing that this woman she's a very famous character of course in the Bible I love the way the prophet says as he finally contacted the woman's spirit and he went straight to her trouble so by contacting her human Spirit now he has access to all these five gates which the spirit is made of so you got imagination conscience memory reason and affection and this is why when we receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that our soul is what is sealed to the day of redemption Satan still has access to our spirit because our spirit is not sealed our spirit can receive blessings from the Holy Ghost and the spirit can get so anointed we could see Visions or prophesy or we could feel the Holy Ghost all over us but in our spirit it would come and go come and go the spirit is not sealed the body is not sealed the soul is what SEALs so when the soul is sealed then the body can still remember how can it do that through your spirit your past how many of y'all still remember things you've done that you wish you'd never done in your life you can remember things we say does that mean I'm not forgiven no it simply means your spirit still has that access to memory and you know you can recall things that happen to you decades ago how is that because the human Spirit has that ability and you can imagine then each of us as we said here today and we recall those things and the Soul forgiven the soul Justified and the Soul born again and sealed by the presence of God oh you say one when we get an end of it when God replaces the human spirit with your theophany you'll see often is what you should have had in the beginning that's why the prophet tells us that the spirit breaks up when it dies so you'll no longer need memory can you imagine when you get your yourself and you will no longer ever remember one bad thing you've ever done because it will be taken out of that channel and you'll no longer have the capability of going down memory lane there is no such a thing and it's theophany so I guess I would think okay so what what made this woman be like this now watch you know brother Branham whenever he was here he would do exactly the same thing and this is one thing that separated him from the rest of the discerners so-called a lot of them was guessing Okay you know uh somebody here today has got a pain who don't uh somebody's I I feel somebody here in the building today is under a lot of stress I'll raise my hand first let's begin here uh you know and it is more of that general term but what made brother branham's gifts so unique was that he would be able to go into the realm of the fourth dimension and be able to see things in people's past years and years ago and be able to go ahead in time and see their future and be able to see their present all at the same time just in a matter of Split Second to go from one to the other to the other and this is why the Pentecostal people that love gifts they absolutely wanted that gift more than anything else but there's only one to a generation and the prophet of God said your pastor won't do this at least if what the angel of the Lord told me is true and I believe the angel of the Lord told him truth well come on no Saturn look at me found it now so if God is going to allow the ministry of the son of man now there's a difference in what brother Branham did and what God would show men does God show me things yes he does but I'll tell you one reason why I don't make a lot of the things that God shows me public this is the reason because if I do it will cause people to gravitate to me well don't sit there and look at me Google that that's exactly what it does it would cause people so God shows me things and I deal with it in a more how can I say it in a more quiet way that I will go to this individual tell them this that and the other or talk to them and watch and and then do it that way instead of doing it on public display because I saw all of that in Pentecost and I saw what it produces for among them A bunch of people well come on don't get quiet now Peter was not a prophet yet when ananias walks up to Peter what does Peter do Peter tells him something that him and his wife had secretly done you remember the story ananas and so far so whenever he did that now Peter was not Discerning but the spirit of God showed him something and yet we don't have any record that Peter went on and on and done that again and again and again so the Holy Ghost can use an individual one time two times three times five times but it doesn't mean that they are to do that over and over again you see that's where that a lot of the people got into a rut and they felt like once God used them and one time in that way they had to continuously do it and eventually they'll get in the flesh unless it's a perfect gift so that's what brings such a reproach on gifts in the first place well what in the world are we doing here this morning I was going to preach on gifts but you see when when brother Branham came it was not just that he had a a little dose of what Peter had well the Lord told him this no it was the ministry of the son of man which is Christ himself which is not the same thing as discernment now I know you'll believe me you don't think I'd lie to you but I've said in my study and talked to people as I did just this past week and as I sit there feeling the unction of the Holy Ghost and I sat there and talked to some people and when I did the Lord led me right down their life and I've seen them talking to one another and punching one another I knew I was writing the channel but I am not no prophet and don't expect me to get up and start doing that today does he show you that he does yes he does but I'm not here to draw your attention to me I wanted all your attention to Christ the word so don't get in your mind that God's servants are a bunch of ignoramuses and God don't lead them yes God leads them but they want to make sure what they're doing with what gives them well God gives them is the right way and brings glory to God and not their own flesh so brother Bantam was totally different now same with the Lord Jesus the Lord Jesus he was here as the minister of the son of man so it was a Ministry that was put on display so that the public would be able to see it same with the prophet himself so naturally if it's going to be the repeat of the son of man it would be the same thing then it wouldn't be Jesus said uh um let's see here um you've got a problem let me see if I can find it here now um uh let's say one minute well you you've got an issue um let me see here um you're rejected by people that's what it is you're rejected by people you wouldn't have to be very smart I would have to know their Customs if she come out to draw water by herself she's rejected of all the rest of people now watch but when the son of man would stand there and wait for the vision the vision would unveil what the communication channel of this woman now watch the same thing in the prophet you have a Christian Spirit that's right you could have been an Atheist or an Infidel but as soon as you walked up and I contacted your spirit I seen you as a Christian isn't it amazing it didn't drag out a measure and take measure the length of her skirt or he didn't measure the length of her hair or you know how often do you pray or how many times do you read your Bible during the day but what was it that witnessed that this was a child of God it was her spirit the communication channel of this woman now every one of us do the same thing that's why sometimes you get around people that claim to be Christians and you feel really really strange how many has ever been there and done that you just feel really really weird they ain't never said nothing yet but you just feel so different why the spirit in you clashes with the spirit in them now that don't mean you're supposed to go around Discerning everybody but God's just probably letting you know that so you'll be good and careful but there's something about children of God that there is a welcoming because the Holy Ghost in you should recognize the Holy Ghost In Me our problem is not your Holy Ghost not like in my Holy Ghost the problem is your flesh don't like mine and mine don't like yours well praise the Lord now watch this again he said the reason I talk to you is to merely contact your spirit so you understand that the microphone is alive you see now what she's speaking into the mic and I've got to contact your spirit first before I can see what's happened in your life so you imagine when a man would walk up into this it would have been a treasure Trove of past it would have been a treasure Trove of past failures memories accomplishments whatever more that God would allow because she would lay open the life of that individual every bit of it stored right there in that human spirit and no doubt there were predominant things that was there so we'd see low spots and he'd see spots that really didn't have a major significance so he would pull out those things that God would show him I see you coming home from school you're dressed in a yellow check address I see you running you fall upon the porch a dog gets out to you fall through the door you've been had fear all of your whole life so what was this a predominant something there and it opened up where was that story not in This Woman's Soul not so much in her body remember the woman crossing the railroad track and she'd had an affair and the prophet was stood down told her what it was she said don't say that don't say that I told really forgot that ah what had happened was the spirit had separated that memory from the cells in her brain but the spirit still contained that channel the spirit still contained that channel and when the prophet contacted her spirit he opened her spirit and went straight in that'd been Plum scary if he'd had all kind of garbage in there wouldn't it wow but you can't hide it you understand it's the way you communicate oh my what in the world am I doing here but whatever whatever we break into the realm of Supernatural I hope you understand that right here in this building today demons and angels are here in this service they're in the world every day that we live and we are communicating either to light or to Darkness from where not just our mouths because sometimes our mouths will say one thing and our soul our spirit will say something else but we are pulsating either light or darkness and them demons know who you are they don't care how much you jump they don't care how high you high jump up and down and scream and holler and quote the Bible if you don't live right they're not afraid of you at all but from you as a child of God and you've heard the prophet do it over and over again that Darkness would follow some people like but follow others the darkness could follow a person from their soul a dark shadow would follow another person not from their soul but from their flesh and yet he would see you are a Christian because I see light coming from you and then he tells us of course and souls are not souls in prison a power prisoner that we are shadows of light so when we are born again then from our soul emanates what the light from the pillar of fire it is that portion of God which you are which is light meters now in you comes this spiritual light as well as the natural light that's what makes the x-rays in your body and Satan that's what he looks at that's what makes him back off you say the devil's afraid of me you'll say the devil's afraid of mother Daryl Ward any other human being you think the devil's scared of any of us no matter how much we scream it ain't that that they look at it's when we speak and they see something coming out of our mouth that's other than us and they see a lie coming out of a child of God now watch when the prophet would contact him he would contact their spirit and then the mystery of the life would unfold so he's communicating with this channel which is the spirit so looking at this woman at the well we see that she very very important figure in the Bible nameless but very important what was it that made her the way she was now was she a bad woman sexually immoral that choice that she simply said I want to live this way I want to have one husband and another one and another one I don't want no peace in life I don't want no home I don't want no family I want to be mean mean mean mean no she actually never chose that listen to this the prophet says probably her parents were the delinquent kind that let her go poor little girl earned her living by a moral living you know what I mean it's the way she had him making a livelihood we know it was horrible but we're going to think that she was turned into that because there was something good behind the woman it proved it so she becomes something that had more to do with circumstance than it had to do choice does that make sense to you why because when when her channel of communication was open and the Lord Jesus shine light upon her it helped her to see what she really wanted to be huh notice again poor child Maybe by bad parents let out on the street and she become a prostitute let me tell you there's a lot of bad women we know that but you can't have a bad woman without them being a bad man so there has to be somebody to make her bad wow somebody to make her bad and sometimes them kids are turned out by a bad Mammy I mean knows what a mammy is some of you don't know what what in the world you call your mother okay it's Southern for Mama everybody with me now so a bad man why is brother Branham laying the blame on the parents because that's where a lot of it lays Y'all Gonna preach to me this morning notice this sometimes him kids are turned up by a bad Mammy well she runs into the bar rooms again he says he come to the city in psychar and he sent his disciples away to buy videos and the little woman came out probably a pretty little woman maybe the child was turned out on the street by her parents and let her go any way about like today they talk about juvenile delinquency it's parent delinquency that's exactly what it is and maybe this child had the same thing her mother let her do anything and she turned out to be an ill-famed woman now what does this do to us then about our perception of this woman it helps us to realize that much of what she had become was not just by her being stubborn hard-headed but much of what she had received as a child uh this one Yuri doesn't mention the woman at the well but it was so good pertaining to the same thing I thought the devil might need just a little bit more scorching in this so I thought I'd go and Scorch him with it we have such juvenile crime wave Across the Nation but I really think it started in the home what in the world would he say about today what would he say about a six-year-old boy shooting his school teacher what would he say about a 12 year old girl stabbing her nine-year-old brother what would he say about all the crimes that even the prosecuting attorneys the district attorneys and many of our illegal people I saw one the other day on YouTube and he was talking about the six-year-old boy that shot the teacher said we've never even had such a thing before in Virginia we don't know where to put them we don't know where to put them with adults with the juveniles Virginia law will not let them try them as an adult he said we frankly don't know what to do and who's in charge of it all people say well they need more education well a lot of them is more educated than you was and their parents lost education will not educate the devil out of you as a matter of fact sometimes I want to put some more educated devil in you so what do they need they need a good Mama and a good daddy well praise the Lord notice the prophet said I don't say it would be all over if they had that a child raised up in a good old-fashioned Godly home but it certainly would give that child the right kind of influence I think many times that the children the homes have been brought up they're turned loose on the street and live for themselves while the mothers in the bar room they don't take care of the child another thing they don't love it and they don't give it affection to take it up it's young you've got to teach it to love well isn't that automatic apparently not you've got to teach it to love and listen to this other word and respect and to read the Bible so you're this woman the channel when Jesus contacts and that's why brother Amanda tell them over and over again you couldn't hide your life right now for nothing it would have been a scary feeling would it honor me if you had something to hide you're saying said oh my God is Mama here is Daddy here is my wife here is the husband here do I brought there it is your life is laid right open because you imagine all that laid inside of there how delicate this is why only a prophet could be trusted with such a gift of this caliber because you say the wrong thing when you're under that anointing you've just caused a divorce you've caused a breakup in the home oh you understand me because you see things sometimes that you're not even supposed to share see things yeah I've experienced this with God that's only meant for you and the Lord You're not to tell everything you go through you're not to tell every experience you have with God some of those things are for you and the Lord only but yet my the Lord fine has a hard time trying to find anybody that he can deal with that they don't want to tell everything and anything that he tells them I'll say shame on us I'll say one of the reasons we don't have more experiences than what we do is that we go around bragging to everybody we want everybody to know well the Lord said this and the Lord said that brother Darryl said one time I see why the Lord ain't got no time to talk to me he's talking to this brother 24 7. and he tells this man this and that may he ain't got no time my goodness here oh God wants to find people he can trust so this woman had been hurt as a child she wasn't taught love that would bear record in the amount of time she was married may seem strange to you but what I've found as a pastor counseling many times women that have been married and you watch them as they'll marry an older man many times the age of their father and you look at that what in the world would that young woman marry that for uh-huh look back in their life a little bit and you find she's looking for a fatherly image I've seen it many many times and yet why why would it be because something was missing and the communication channel of that individual is reaching out in the channel of what affection affection so it was not met many of you understand you've had families that way and members that you know yourself and they come that very same way so we look at that Sheba and most of us will never be heard in the way that she was but yet all of us come to the Earth and as we go through our journey we get hurt one of the most painful hurts is hurt by friends anybody ever been hurt by friends I found the solution to never be hurt by friends you want the answer don't have any oh but myself I can't live that way I can't live without friends and love maybe you can maybe you can go back in the cave and live it like a Hermit I can't I have to be loved and I have to love I have to have friends and I have to show friendship how many understands what I'm saying so then when we have friends it comes with a risk that one or both or all of your friends eventually may hurt you and then you're saying I wish I'd have never even had them as my friend now I'm sure nobody here has ever been heard by friends of course except for me but yet I'll go ahead and preach it for some of these sorry people that stream these Services maybe we get to the new church all them people that's got so many faults will quit streaming us so we can just preach about Heavenly angels and oh my Great Divine things of course and none of y'all wouldn't get to come and I wouldn't get your boots to you because I know I don't live there either so when we get hurt by friends or family my can be some of the deepest scars that we bear and our lord Jesus understands that hurt in Zechariah 13 6 prophecy speaking of him and one shall say unto him what are these wounds in thy hints then he shall answer those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends imagine the Lord Jesus allowing himself to be hurt by friends so when you young people would get hurt by friends and cry and get your heart broke you could go to the Lord Jesus and he'd say I understand I mean he's ever been hurt by friends you know David was also hurt by friends the thing is when we get hurt what will we do with the hurt for many people they turn in by that I mean they turn in on themselves and they bring their feelings their trust the scripture says a brother offended is harder to be one than a strong City and their contention are like the bars of a castle so if we ever get hurt deeply what most people tend to do is build a wall around that part of us and we'll never let anybody else ever come that close you ever be around people like that and it's like you can get so close and they'll never let you get any closer well no doubt they've been hurt by someone and hurt deeply and what you're bumping up against is that wall that they have around themselves and they think they will protect themselves but actually they're letting the devil Rob them because until that wall comes down you'll never be able to love right you'll never be able to to be able to really relate to others this may surprise you but even to God until that thing is broken away from your life I want you to notice that David had come to this trying time in his life after the situation with Bathsheba now he's been married to her for some time and the scripture that we want to read is second Samuel 15 2 and it is Absalom and you know Absalom is one of David's favorite sons and Absalom Rosa pearlian Stood Beside the way of the gate and it was so that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment then Absalom called unto him and said of what City Art Thou and he said thy servant is one of the tribes of Israel now watch Absalom was one of the king's Sons so he was a prince but yet he was not ordained or not anointed by God to ever become king you see God did not let the children of Israel vote for who their king would be as we do in politics but God would send the prophet and the prophet would anoint him but Absalom had this something about him and you can read his history course and find out there must have been very difficult having all these women and having all these higher brothers and half-sisters and Lord Jesus I'm glad we don't believe in polygamy now noticing so Absalom has this desire in him even though he's not anointed to be king and prophetically no Prophet ever went to him but he wanted to be king he wanted to be king now watch what he would do so when people would come in for the Judgment uh this is actually he's been reinstated into David's Fellowship after killing his brother amnon then he starts to stand outside near The City Gate when a person would come in and say what were you from I'm from Elizabethton um I'm from Johnson City I'm from Gray and he would say and Absalom said unto him see thy matters are good and right but there is no man deputed which means set up in position of deputed of the king to heresy now watch what he's doing and Absalom said moreover all that I were made judge in the land now watch what he's going to do oh that our May judge in the land that every man which hath a suit or a cause might come to me and I would do him Justice yeah he's running for president that's a politician right there if I ever heard one now what does he do he appeals to that part of that Humanity which wants to be recognized personally by leaders that's something in humanity that wants that something to be identified so here's Prince Absalom and he's standing out there at the gate now more than likely you didn't see David how tall because David was so busy and had so much going so here Absalom saw this window that was open I remember still dealing with a lot of pain a lot of anxiety David was from all that he went through so whenever he would come through he said oh I wish that I could be a judge oh I'll tell you one thing if I could be that boy how I would help God's people I'm telling you what I I would just do such great things and I would do him Justice now watch verse five and it was so that when any man came now to him to do obeisance so this is the prince now so this is what you do you would come up and you would do obeisance to the prince but watch what Prince Charming does he put forth his hand and took him and kissed him so now here they are they're coming up to the prince to bow to the prince but the prince grabs them by hand so brother Johnson comes up and he grabs him and and instead of him allowing him to Bow oh no Absalom reaches and grabs him and says come here my brother encase him on the side of the face wow can you imagine going home telling your mama can you imagine going back to your little insignificant Village you've never even shook David's hand your whole life you've never even have a personal talk with David but here Absalom shook your hand and wouldn't even let you bow before him and stopped you oh my that appeals to this right here and all you dear little angels that are with us today you pardon me while I'll speak to some of these sorry outfits of streaming that's probably some of them down in South Africa and over in Switzerland and you know some of them portal things over there they're not Blessed Like Us Americans with so much humility now notice what the Bible says and on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment so Absalom stole stole stole the hearts of the men of Israel now let me just make sure that you understand Absalom is not just a preacher type Absalom can be one in your own family Absalom can be just about anybody but they begin to speak words smooth as butter David said how many of our girls have been polluted by some sorry outfit boy that didn't even want to live right and didn't want to come to church well go ahead and preach brother Donnie Amazon long enough to get him married and then wound up pulling them out of church now notice what he does and Absalom sent for a hither verse 12. the gilanite David's counselor from his City even from guylo where he offered sacrifices and the conspiracy was strong for the people increased continually with Absalom this never ceases to amaze me how dumb people can be you got to be kidding me man had not been anointed this man had not been approved by God and yet this is growing and growing and growing and then we find this man by the name of the hisophile anybody remember who he is bathsheba's grandfather oh now you wonder if he's got an agenda personal something against I was laying on the bed this morning a few minutes after three and unable to go back to sleep and I began to think about bathsheb and I thought my goodness poor woman here she goes again back into this other stage of trauma in her life that her husband is now going to be driven from Jerusalem this Rebellion got so great started with the northern tribes and it got so great against God's anointed king now watch David A True True man that loved God and loved his people now this is after his mistake remember that David said instead of causing Israel to fight and defied the Kingdom of Israel I'll just leave that's a real man I'll just leave so David gets his counselors that he gets his soldiers those that are personal bodyguards his mercenaries and he gets those and he gets his families wives and David starts to leave in order to keep peace and keep people from dying so here goes poor Bathsheba now she hears her grandfather has joined with Absalom oh my goodness so here she goes again now another part and some of you all thought you all had the most drama in your life notice what the Bible says then the hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom so there comes a messenger in verse 13 and tells David the hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom verse 31 and one told David saying I hit the fell is among the conspirators was Absalom now if it wasn't bad enough that David's own son is causing this revolt one of David's closest friends one of David's closest advisors joins in the Rebellion which is his wife's grandfather so how are you going to go home at night and talk about that now if your wife is your best friend you talk to her just about everything don't you well you got to have somebody to talk about cramps about so you imagine how David David don't get me going don't get me now you know I love him and you know that I think so much of him but you have to wonder what his agenda was this man was a powerful influence and sway over the children of Israel an Absalom sent for him can it go on I'm glad you said that because I was going to anyway but it's just not sure when y'all now watch all my children and one told David saying a hissa fell is among the conspirators with Absalom how do you and I respond if such things would happen to us pray after this service we'll respond this way and David said that's sorry dog I'll hang him I'll do this and that and the other I'll never let him live it I'll tell you one thing go get him somebody go get him and David said oh Lord I pray you see turn the Council of a hit the fell into foolishness now this news comes notice how it's synchronized the greatest trial of his life David has already lost an element of his Prestige his honor his respect because of his adultery now his own son is Raising in revolt against him have you ever noticed when it rains it pours so you get one bit of bad news and you think well I'm glad that's over there whoops here comes more and there's another you imagine David is so distraught and he said God what have I done Lord will I never pay will this never stop please help me and then somebody comes and tells him oh yes I fell John Lewis oh no not him he was one of my dearest closest friends what I find so amazing about this is David's reaction to this was divine so it's a reaction to the bad news now this prayer to you may sound very selfish but David is thinking not so much about himself as he is the kingdom he then sees what pain what reproach he's brought upon the body he don't want to be the cause again Harry for more to come God may his counsel turn to foolishness listen to the contents of that prayer this is the exact opposite of what this man was famous for this man was known for his counsel it was so precise so perfect albeit God answered his prayer I figure most of us would be a whole lot better off if we'd spend less time on Facebook and spend more time with our face in the book praying for our enemies pray for them that despitefully use us turn the other cheek if they sue you for your coat give them your shirt give me britches if they want them just be sure you got some more to put off they want you serious go ahead and give them your Colossus at the same time but instead if we're not careful we think of resent and revenge on how we can get even with them well I'm gonna go ahead and preach amen this is really helpful but now you know it's amazing because the people for whom remember David had fought for these people how many times had David risked his life in battle for these people and they turned from David and go to this egotistical leader which God has never approved oh my goodness notice oh my his prayer God turn his counsel into foolishness in others heard by the Queen of Scotland I found this I thought it's so interesting I want to read it to you that she feared more feared the prayers of John Knox which was a preacher of the Presbyterian move she feared the prayers of John Knox more than any army she had ever faced [Laughter] the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much can have a few more minutes I don't know if you're aware of this or not but Psalms 41 9 turn that we'll read there also Psalms 55 12 are written along this same Avenue speaking of a hitherfell notices Psalm 41 9. now both of these also have a compound meaning or a double fulfillment in that they was fulfilled in David but also in the Lord Jesus this is a Messianic Psalm here verse 9 41 9. yay my own familiar friend in whom I trusted which did eat of my bread hath lifted up his heel against me of course speaking of a hysterophile but also speaking of Judas and I dare say probably speaking of some of you someone or more than one someone that you've loved and fellowshipped and maybe you confide it in and shared things that you thought was a dear friend and come to find out they told that secret of yours and it devastated you left you to worry you're not even sure you can trust anybody anymore well I'll tell you depends on what you do with these hurts and these scars you can let them control you or you by the spirit of God can control them and tell them they are not your master they are not your God they are not your lord nor your king notice again same context different verse chapter and verse Psalm 55 12. for it was not an enemy that reproached me then I could have borne it Now watch how David deals with the contrast if it would have been a moabite or a Philistine such as Goliath that would have cursed me by his gods if it would have been a mower by a person if it had been an ammonite if it had been somebody like that he said if it was not an enemy that reproached me then could I have borne it neither was it he that hated me that didn't magnify himself against me I would have hid myself from him you see that's exactly what David had done when Saul come against him he hid himself because all that made him an enemy David when the Lord Jesus in The Book of John when the Pharisees had come to get the Lord Jesus and what did he do the Bible says Jesus just walked right among them somehow it disappeared or put a veil over them well they couldn't see him and he walked right among them right through them and they never even knew he was there and David said had it been somebody like that I would have just simply hid myself and if it didn't matter scribe or a Pharisee or in a scene the Lord Jesus could have hit himself but how do you hide from one who knows where you pray but do you ever find Jesus on the throne or in the book of Acts going through all of this about how sad he was and how depressed he was and how down he was because Judas betrayed him it's amazing when you said to this if you'd like to read it sometimes in Psalms 52. David's presence and knob had been disclosed to Saul by doing the Edomite in Psalm 54 David had been betrayed by the people of zip z-i-p-h by his own countrymen so what we're leading up to is Psalm 52 Psalm 54 and then we come to the ultimate betrayal which is Psalm 55 which is the Betrayal of an intimate friend look friend whenever you and I look at this today we have to realize we are all subject to such things as this the question is will it happen it's when will it happen and what will we do about it when it does I wish my Lord in life was not to be a preacher I wish my lot and life if I had to be a preacher would have been one like some of my brothers where you could preach all kinds of sermons and wind up not making too many people mad I really don't understand that feeling must be blissful must be very happy my lot in life as a preacher I was given a big long sharp sword sharp on both sides so it cuts you and me at the same time I was given a lot in life which was not one desired but one controversial I've been hurt I've been run down I've been cast out by my friends I've stood at times in this message what if it wasn't for the local Brothers of our church or their preacher would even speak to me preachers wouldn't even call me from meetings ain't been that many years ago that they all quit calling me for meetings huh so how many of them do you hate today brother Donnie none why I refused for that to control me come on children I refuse for what people do to me to let me control that I am going to control it as a Son of God Amen I'm not standing you're telling you something today that is an impossibility I'm sending you to telling you something that is a personal victory for me over and over and over again oh my can you imagine as David walks into this watch this he writes about the same situation with a hippophil I'm down in verse 20. he hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him my friend has put forth I was at peace with him I had no no war with him and David said you know look what he's done with me he's broken his Covenant the words of his mouth were smoother than butter but war was in his heart his words were softer than oil this old boy made a good politician wouldn't he yeah they were drawn swords boy boy isn't that amazing it takes the Holy Ghost to help us whenever a peoples better in their words and all in their words and the spirit of God lets you hear as he goes say I don't think olive oil does that I don't think butter does that whenever you go to drawing it from the stick does it but this man's words so smooth it has a fail such were the words of a hisfl such were the words of Judas when he comes and grabs the door to heaven and says hail master and kiss the door to heaven and went to hell verse 12. we'll wind up here just momentary for it was not an enemy that reproached me then I could have borne it neither was it he that hated me that didn't magnify himself against me then I would have hid myself from him but it was thou a man mind equal my guide the Hebrew word there is aloof which means my intimate friend my guide mine acquaintance we took sweet counsel together we walked into the house of God I mean this is somebody you went to church with he's like if you could trust anybody you could trust her she was a good sister she loved the Lord and yet look how she hurts you this young man always a fine Christian often asked him up to pray and oh he wind up hurting you so deeply and you went to church together and you sang together in the youth choir how could he do that we took sweet counsel together and walked into the house of God in company oh David what are you going to do any all remember the end of athel now this story goes on you see for those who joined in this Rebellion their end was not good because they were standing against God's anointed king now maybe Absalom said my daddy come out of the Daughtry glory to God it ain't right maybe hisself got up and he took his text I'd like to preach tonight on an adulterous King and I want to tell you God don't go along and okay can I get to it amen somebody say amen glory to God I never did like David no hell I'll tell you one thing is too big for his britches he's King this and King died he can sing he can shout he can jump he can do all them thinking man after God's Own Heart yeah right so there was another counselor called who shy who shy came to David and bowed before him and said oh my king let me go with you he said who shall I will you serve the King was all in my heart my allegiance belongs to you he said then I want you to go back to the court of Absalom and be one of his counselors oh great king no no I cannot do that I cannot do that you will be my counselor and you will confound what is it God setting up the answer to David's prayer so ahithophel gives advice who shy comes back with opposite advice and the hitherphale realizes his days remember the end remember the end he hangs himself what a terrible way to die your legacy right down through history he's been preached as this betrayer and taken his life couldn't forgive couldn't forgive David for his wrong held a grudge held an alt but look at David prays there's one thing about David he had plenty of mistakes but you got to admit it that God knew how to repent don't you want to know how to repent [Applause] thank you brother Terry now friends the question is this all of that being said to come to this what will you do but the Lord what will you do what will you do brother Matthew what will your sisters do when people hurt you turn against you run you down say things is not even true will you pray for him like David did will you pray are you more concerned about the message body and the church body are you concerned about your own agenda oh may God help us wounded in the house of our friends can you imagine as David whenever the news comes to him a Runner comes it winds up in a war division comes the tribes divide David is out of Jerusalem now Absalom goes into the concubines lays with the concubines then they rally and they start a war remember it was Absalom that started the war against David not wise you don't attack an anointed servant of God think you'll ever get ahead you are cutting your own throat touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm but somehow Absalom thinks he can do it remember they send them out joab Abner here comes all the Army coming out and David says watch the young man watch single men be careful be careful don't Spanish life to remember he got had real thick bushy hair and went riding on the back of his mule and he got his hair hung in the branches of the oak when they come up they find him hanging there by his hair they don't come and spare him they don't come and give him Grace but each one of them take their sword and RAM it in him till his blood gushes out and covers the ground what a terrible thing here comes a runner telling David David how goes the battle how what about the young man absent what about the other I don't know I don't know I left and they're still fighting another one coming what about absolute oh may all the enemies of my Lord the king David Goes to the gate starts weeping howling Absalom Absalom my son my son what to God I died for thee yeah you see even when he'd done wrong and the wrath of God turned on him David wasn't dancing God I got rid of that devil his heart is broken I love it when we Rejoice I love it when we cry I love it when we shout and run but this right here will be my favorite time when Word of Life Church can come to a spot that we will not rejoice when our enemies fall no matter if they've stole money from you they've called you alive or whatever it is they've done but you will feel like David you'll say I hope they made peace with God then you know what friends is your pastor I'll say Lord that's how to serve an apartment peace I believe it's time for me to sit down I believe I can retire not alive I'm 66 years old how long do I have to preach you know what they say they do to old old preachers don't you they put them out to Pastor no pun intended oh no we're getting close to a body change when we can love our enemies we can pray for them that keep us awake and we don't pray for wraths inventions what we'll do will you do with your scars woman at the well what will you do with your scars Little David this valerians together help us Lord have a lot to be remembered today before the Lord God bless your hearts look friends I know it can be so tough people run you down talk about you you just don't understand why they do I know it can be tough but whatever you do don't let that thing destroy you people don't treat you right it's just amazing to me how Christians will take your say and repeat it and don't even go to the person that's being accused and ask them the truth of it it's unbelievable the lies that people have told on me through the years and very few people have had enough respect for you to even ask you theirself do you understand as you respect God's servants so your Prophet said as you respect God's servant that's the way you respect God so if you receive a lie against the servant of God you're receiving one against God not just preachers but let's bring it on down to the body men women boys girls no wonder James said be swift to hear slow to speak slow to Wrath oh Hallelujah thank you Lord thank you Lord thank you Lord Jesus Heavenly Father I'm sure if our Spirits have been opened today by the great discerner we don't need Psychology to try to sit down and open us up and we know that's what psychologists do they use the psyche the psyche is the mind the prophet tells us so they open up things about us and they want to figure out this and that and the other that's what therapists will do they'll try to figure out where do we get these scars and why do you have that resentment of this and that and the other and for some it only makes it worse because they open it up and then they ain't got the answer to help cure it so for some of our sisters if I've heard it before who went to some of these and they're going to ask them why do you wear them dresses why do you go about that long hair some of these therapists here in Johnson City have told some of them they need to cut their hair and get rid of them dresses and get them some pants and they don't need to obey their husbands no more but Lord God we don't want to open spirits today and give psychology or intellectual speeches but may the Holy Ghost go down in each wounded hurt person today Father bring healing to his Jesus oh Lord God I pray father how many emails and texts have I got in the last few weeks of people from different parts of the world who've been carrying things for 10 15 20 years and the word has set them free oh Jesus contact my spirit Lord contact the spirit of your bride today heal us Lord heal us of our desires to get even with people or revenge or jealousy or hatred help us father I pray oh Lord some of these in life if they would have had a choice they would have no doubt chosen easier past than what they walked some of them have been abused or just physically maybe mentally psychologically verbally oh Lord God may you touch everheart today I pray Jesus we know that we'll always remember these things that's been done to us but we believe you can so heal us father that it'll no longer stir up anger Lord when we were just little kids and mama had packed us a little picnic to go out behind the house for a picnic in the woods we'd been through those woods many times but little did we know we would encounter a stranger there that day that would change our lives that stranger was a four-legged stranger a rabid Fox as it started running up and down the hills and knocked him out in Harry's little sister down Kim started nibbling on her arms and Lord me being the oldest I felt it was my responsibility to protect her saw grabbed a little pocket knife out of my pocket and started after that fox and he grabbed me by the hand and laid my hand wide open my hands started pouring the blood and my hand went numb my siblings took off running and I'll come up behind the last one because the fox was still there running around terrified scared to death but yet Lord I still have that right hand today that that fox bit so many years ago but I'm so glad that wound has not been open all those years since I was 10 or 11 years old something like that nobody would want to be around me if that was an open wound I told my mom and dad as we were going to the doctor that day if I go mad mama please don't let me bite none of the kids because our grandmother mom had told me a story Harry remembers it well about a person that had rabies and they had to chain the individual to a bed because they went out of their mind so that formed a fear in me so here I am the little boy bit by rabid Fox I know they wouldn't be able to relate to it maybe but something similar I could see myself chained to a bed with a chained and I asked my mom and dad please don't let me bite the kids because I was afraid I was going mad So Stories affect us things we hear things we learn things we go through but now Lord as I have my left hand stroking across that part of my right hand what I feel is not blood what I feel is not an open gash what I feel is a scar that Dr mccarg sewed up years and years ago and I remember seeing that doctor a very Gruff type of a man as he sewed up my hand the tears trickled out of his eyes and fell down on my hand we had to go to his house every day for 14 days to get shots in our stomach to keep us from going mad oh Dr Jesus we want to bring our scars up to you today wounds from Friends wounds from families we don't want to go mad as it were we see what Satan's doing to the world we don't want to be changed with chains of Darkness Dr Jesus we're coming to your house hey didn't get bit so they thought Harry was okay so the doctor began to ask was anybody else a bit we said no no said did anybody else have an open wound and Harry Had A sower on his body and the doctor said have somebody to bring you up excuse me for if he would get just the saliva of that fox in that wound he could contact rabies that's how contagious sin is maybe some of them haven't been bit this hard but they've got an open wound and just a little bit of saliva of that mad devil Fox just for good measure we're going to bring them too all of us beginning with the preachers down to the deacons the trustees our elders here in the church all of us we just want to make a trip up to Papa's house and ask you to help us Lord that day Lord God later in the day the fox Hunters around that country about their dogs they started hunting that fox my uncle finally shot it my daddy's brother out of a tree does anybody here knows foxes don't even climb trees that fox was so out of its mind for years you remember Lord I was terrified of foxes scared to death even see one on the side of the road but now I've got 10 or 12 of them probably mounted taxidermies all different colors all different breeds wow my fear is gone my fear is gone we used to fear death we used to fear so much but the new birth is taking the fear of dying away from us now may you help us with the fear of our tomatoes the fear well this friend will do this and this ought to do that help us Jesus oh Lord God put your minister to us today Father it would go to our physician tomorrow and say dog I need a vaccine for my spirit no doubt he'd look at us or she and think this person is mentally deranged but I wonder if they only knew a lot of the people they see the damage is stored of their spirit we worship you today Jesus let's just sing something together hey you believe you have faith today to be able to reach out and Touch the Hem of His Garment maybe to
