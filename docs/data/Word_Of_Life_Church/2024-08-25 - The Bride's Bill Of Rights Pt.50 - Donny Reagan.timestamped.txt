[44:59] true to one another I'm just so glad
[45:02] he's so
[45:03] forgiving when may fall short of his
[45:06] glory you may be here today and you may
[45:10] feel like a total complete
[45:13] failure in whatever you're called to be
[45:16] whether it's a husband or a father or a
[45:19] preacher or a businessman whatever you
[45:23] do but I'm glad that we're serving a God
[45:26] today that is a god of new
[45:30] beginnings and every morning his mercies
[45:34] are
[45:35] renewed thank
[45:38] god let's turn together to Mark chap
[45:41] 15:39 if you
[45:43] would I want to speak to you again today
[45:45] on the
[45:47] right to a
[45:50] Ministry each Christian here
[45:53] today has a
[45:55] call a multi
[45:57] aspect
[45:59] multifaceted
[46:01] call it may change and evolve over the
[46:05] years from when your life is dedicated
[46:08] to the
[46:09] Lord ultimately we want to be able to
[46:13] serve his
[46:15] purpose only those who serve God's
[46:19] purpose have a resurrection to
[46:23] life so people may wonder what is our
[46:27] part in the economy of God is our
[46:29] purpose in the economy of God that
[46:31] important it
[46:32] is you see if we don't serve him well in
[46:37] this life and fulfill that purpose there
[46:40] will be no Resurrection for
[46:42] us
[46:44] none I'm talking about onean to life not
[46:47] un
[46:48] judgment so it's so serious today and so
[46:52] important so let's approach it with that
[46:55] in mind if you would
[46:57] and when the Centurion which stood over
[46:59] against him saw that he so cried out and
[47:03] gave up the ghost He said truly this
[47:07] man was the son of God there were also
[47:11] women looking on a far
[47:14] off among whom was Mary Magdalene and
[47:18] Mary the mother of James the Le and
[47:20] Joseph and
[47:22] salomi who also when he was in Galilee
[47:27] followed him and
[47:31] ministered unto him so women were
[47:35] ministering unto the Lord Jesus and we
[47:38] know that they were not as we've said
[47:39] taking the scriptures and telling Jesus
[47:42] to sat down they going to preach him a
[47:44] sermon but they were ministering to him
[47:47] things that he had need of remember
[47:49] Jesus called his disciples and they all
[47:51] quit their
[47:52] jobs Jesus was a carpenter for him many
[47:55] every years he quit put his job so how
[47:59] they going to pay for this work remember
[48:01] there's quite a following around them
[48:03] who bought all the food who paid for the
[48:06] lodging who paid for the trips to be
[48:09] able to go here and there and people
[48:12] saying well I don't never preach I could
[48:14] never do anything you realize whenever
[48:17] you will contribute your tithes and
[48:20] offerings and then I will delegate that
[48:23] and help pay for a brother trip here and
[48:25] a trip there and a trip there and
[48:27] somewhere else and there Souls that are
[48:29] being saved people's lives who are
[48:32] changed do you understand you will stand
[48:35] there that day and the Lord will reward
[48:37] you along with that
[48:39] preacher because youve done your part so
[48:42] every one of us have an important thing
[48:43] to do Philippians chapter
[48:48] 2:5 I love the way Paul was that he he
[48:52] was not the type of preacher that was so
[48:54] caught up in his own Ministry
[48:57] and complimenting his own self and
[49:01] talking about all the great things that
[49:03] God did through him and not
[49:06] acknowledging what God had did through
[49:08] others which were less than him he
[49:11] mentioned so many uh people in the
[49:14] gospels here he's going to speak about
[49:17] apodius yet I suppose it necessary to
[49:20] send unto you
[49:22] apodius my
[49:24] brother and companion in labor and fell
[49:28] a soldier but your messenger now look at
[49:33] the categories that this brother apodius
[49:36] served so to Paul he was a brother and a
[49:41] companion in
[49:43] labor but to others he was a messenger
[49:50] look at the aspects that this brother
[49:52] served now he wasn't a church age
[49:54] messenger he wasn't a prophet wasn't a
[49:56] major or Sage or a prophet but yet he
[50:00] ministered to Paul he was a companion in
[50:03] labor you know sometimes a secondary
[50:06] position like that is so hard for some
[50:10] preachers to ever take it's like they
[50:12] feel like they have to have their own
[50:15] aspect of this and that and the other
[50:17] and yet God had this brother's name
[50:20] mentioned for such a position your
[50:23] messenger he that ministered
[50:26] to my
[50:28] wants and the word there is need or
[50:31] necessity or
[50:33] lack I may like to be remembered today
[50:36] as we pray and me just wants the Lord to
[50:38] open your hearts to the word and to be
[50:41] able to speak to
[50:43] us Lord Jesus we thank you so much for
[50:47] what you mean to us thank you for
[50:49] another day that we can be able to come
[50:51] to the house of God on Sunday
[50:54] morning Lord God we ask that that you'd
[50:56] be mindful of us our needs are many Lord
[51:01] God we pray in the name of Jesus that
[51:04] you'd also be mindful of your nation
[51:08] Israel you see father that uh Hezbollah
[51:12] attacking them and them making a move a
[51:15] preemptive strike upon them and Lord you
[51:19] see the way this is going to go we pray
[51:21] Lord Jesus that you would just help them
[51:25] we know every Jew is not one of yours
[51:28] the same way every Christian is not
[51:30] bride but we pray father you'd watch
[51:33] over them we know it's in the charter of
[51:36] Hezbollah poo Hamas many many of the
[51:41] Arabs of their countries to absolutely
[51:45] annihilate and Destroy Israel they will
[51:49] not be happy so they say until every one
[51:53] of them are dead but they might as well
[51:56] say they're going to cause the Moon Not
[51:59] To Shine Anymore or the sun cuz you have
[52:02] said you will have a seed of Israel and
[52:07] then then how much more father can we
[52:09] look at our position as the Gentile
[52:11] bride and say neither will you forget us
[52:15] you're mindful of us pray that you'd
[52:17] help us today may we be able to look
[52:20] into your word and find our position and
[52:23] give us more faith to be able to act on
[52:26] what we're called to do granted father
[52:29] we pray in the name of Jesus amen God
[52:33] bless you Saints you may be
[52:38] seated what a great thing to be a child
[52:41] of God to be able to find our position
[52:45] in Christ Jesus as I hear the prophet
[52:47] said in things that ought to be
[52:51] 12765 in cavina California oh it means
[52:55] so much nowadays Church to see ourselves
[53:00] positionally placed in Christ
[53:04] Jesus not only naturally but of course
[53:08] spiritually but it's not only
[53:11] spiritually but also naturally and it's
[53:14] amazing how they coincide together I'd
[53:18] like to sometime if the Lord would ever
[53:20] let me do it I've done a study for
[53:23] several years and taken each Church
[53:27] in the New Testament the Church of
[53:29] Ephesus the church at colassi the church
[53:32] at thessalonica the church at leoda all
[53:35] the different churches that are
[53:37] mentioned in the New Testament by which
[53:39] letters have been sent to them it's
[53:42] quite quite a an enlightening thing
[53:45] because you see no matter where they
[53:47] lived and what they were dealing with
[53:50] each church had its good points and each
[53:54] church had its points that they needed
[53:56] to be corrected and that was of course
[53:59] because of the area that they live the
[54:02] spirits they were fighting in that area
[54:04] I may have to preach against things here
[54:07] or I may not have to preach against
[54:08] certain things that say brother Tim PR
[54:11] will have to deal with over and over
[54:13] again I may have to deal with things he
[54:15] may never have to mention or other
[54:17] brothers around the world and it's not
[54:20] you know people compare well brother
[54:21] Donnie's preaching this brother Tim
[54:23] saying that brother so and so is saying
[54:25] that but we have to be mindful that if
[54:28] there are things that are being said
[54:30] it's because there's a need for it like
[54:32] the church at Corinth very carnal Church
[54:36] very carnal yet they absolutely loved
[54:40] spiritual gifts and at the same time
[54:44] their church had more issues and more
[54:47] troubles with spiritual gifts than any
[54:50] other Church in the New Testament but if
[54:53] that go Paul had not written it down led
[54:57] by the spirit of God to write it down
[54:59] and deal with their problems how many
[55:02] examples would we have in the entire New
[55:05] Testament of how gifts ought to be
[55:08] operated so God took the trouble in the
[55:11] Corinthian Church and allowed his
[55:14] servant to take that trouble and be able
[55:17] to lay out the word in order to show not
[55:21] only that church but the future
[55:23] generations of people how they should
[55:26] should be done you understand well the
[55:28] church at Ephesus now they were a
[55:31] spiritual church too and they had gifts
[55:34] Prophet said they did they had gifts and
[55:36] they had manifestations of God but you
[55:39] never find Paul having to write to the
[55:42] church at Ephesus and said now don't get
[55:44] up and talk in tongues if there's no
[55:46] interpreter there you never you never
[55:48] find him writing about that because
[55:50] their problems were not like that you
[55:54] never find Paul ever having to address
[55:56] like it did the Corinthian Church of a
[55:58] man that was actually living with his
[56:03] stepmother and they were coming inside
[56:05] the church living that kind of life in
[56:08] sin and the church was just basically
[56:11] letting it go nothing was being said
[56:14] about it so Paul had to deal with that
[56:18] and yet you look at the church at
[56:19] colossia they were a total different
[56:21] Church very revelated church church of
[56:24] great understanding Church of thes
[56:26] the same way but when you go to look at
[56:29] each one of them they were missing
[56:32] certain parts now if we would take the
[56:35] Word of Life church and we would compare
[56:38] it to say evening light Tabernacle in
[56:41] Minden Louisiana Full Gospel uh
[56:44] Lighthouse church up in Virginia or we
[56:47] would take and compare it to this church
[56:50] in India this one in Africa and that one
[56:52] there and we say oh my well them folks
[56:55] have got some real problem problems y
[56:57] now you're living in the real world
[56:59] every Church you go to has problems and
[57:03] I hate to be the bear of bad news but if
[57:05] you're looking for a perfect one let me
[57:07] just tell you right now you might as
[57:09] well look for a needle and a haystack
[57:11] cuz you ain't going to find one and if
[57:13] you did when you got there you'd ruin
[57:16] the whole
[57:17] thing so just accept it for what it is
[57:20] every church has issues every church has
[57:24] problems every church has great traits
[57:28] of the word of God I'm talk about those
[57:30] that are following the word of the hour
[57:31] now and then every church is going to
[57:34] have issues and problems that need to be
[57:37] dealt with by the word and the church
[57:39] said amen now whenever we look at
[57:43] position then I find it amazing that
[57:46] this great revelated church in Ephesus
[57:49] that had such understanding about
[57:51] election they were so able to perceive
[57:55] about the unity of the bride and the
[57:57] groom in the spiritual as aspect in
[58:00] Ephesians 5 that Paul really didn't have
[58:02] to go into a lot of depth and
[58:04] understanding and explained to them what
[58:06] God had done to the Gentile bride
[58:07] remember the church at Ephesus was
[58:09] mainly Gentiles as the church at coloss
[58:11] also the Church of Corinth and also the
[58:14] Church of thessalonica the Lord never
[58:16] spoke to Paul as far as we know and told
[58:19] him that he had a bunch of people at
[58:22] Ephesus we have no record that the Lord
[58:24] ever told him that in coloss or or
[58:26] thessalonica but the Lord knew the
[58:29] church at Corinth was going to be a
[58:31] Troublesome church so the Lord spoke to
[58:34] Paul early on in the in the early stages
[58:37] of the work at Corinth and he told him
[58:40] this I have much people in this city
[58:45] much people no doubt he fell back on
[58:49] that over and over and over again he
[58:52] must have got so discouraged with that
[58:55] church he felt like he was wasting his
[58:58] time he would preach on Holiness and
[59:00] they would have all types of sin he
[59:03] would preach on love and and and they
[59:05] was more emphasizing on speaking in
[59:08] tongues or shouting or whatever more
[59:10] they thought that was the spiritual
[59:12] aspect and Paul had to go down the
[59:14] Avenue of 1 Corinthians 13 and teach
[59:17] them without love their gifts were
[59:19] absolutely Vain and of no value but
[59:23] think of it if he had not dealt with
[59:25] that would we have ever known what we
[59:28] know about charity show me in any other
[59:31] books of the New Testament where any of
[59:34] the authors pin such great Revelation
[59:38] about what charity the love of God
[59:40] really is so if we look at it in the
[59:43] right way even in our shortcomings and
[59:45] our failures and when Servants of God
[59:48] whether it's a pastor or others are LED
[59:50] of the spirit of God to deal with
[59:52] shortcomings in our assembly and our
[59:54] lives if we look look at it the right
[59:56] way will know that God is Not only using
[59:59] that for us for our families for our
[1:00:02] lives for our church but more than
[1:00:04] likely there'll be other people that'll
[1:00:06] be able to hear it and say you know what
[1:00:07] I needed that too praise the Lord so God
[1:00:11] knew exactly how to put these people
[1:00:15] together and no doubt the people in that
[1:00:17] day you'd go to to the church at Corinth
[1:00:20] now remember Corinth was a port city so
[1:00:23] there's a lot of Greeks and a lot of
[1:00:25] Phoenicians
[1:00:26] and a lot of different ones because it
[1:00:28] was a major port city so it be similar
[1:00:30] to Los Angeles or something like that so
[1:00:32] there were ships that was coming from Ty
[1:00:35] and siden there would have been Ships
[1:00:37] coming from Europe there would have been
[1:00:39] ships that would have been coming from
[1:00:40] all different types of places and they
[1:00:43] would have had you know it's based upon
[1:00:45] supply and demand so they would have
[1:00:47] been having everything imaginable in
[1:00:50] that City the sex trade was unbelievable
[1:00:54] the drinking and all the things that was
[1:00:56] there it was a horrible horrible place
[1:00:59] but yet God said I've got a lot of
[1:01:01] people here I'm going to start a church
[1:01:04] I guess he can start one wherever he
[1:01:06] wants to can't he and what did he do
[1:01:08] that church was able to be able to
[1:01:11] rescue the seed of God but they come
[1:01:14] with baggage like you and I did when we
[1:01:17] come to the Lord so they love the Lord
[1:01:20] they wanted to do something for God and
[1:01:23] boy somehow they tapped into them gifts
[1:01:25] and there must have been a bunch of
[1:01:27] people that went there and they just was
[1:01:30] able to grab a hold to tongues and
[1:01:32] interpretation and prophecy and they
[1:01:35] made the offest mess out of it that ever
[1:01:38] was and they begin to make the main
[1:01:41] emphasis of every service speaking in
[1:01:45] tongues and spiritual this and spiritual
[1:01:48] that no doubt they would compare thems
[1:01:50] to the church at Ephesus and the church
[1:01:52] at Colossians said well I'll tell you
[1:01:54] one thing they may they understand
[1:01:56] predestination but they sure ain't as
[1:01:58] spiritual as we are I'm telling you what
[1:02:01] we have meetings in our church and we're
[1:02:03] so caught up in the spirit of God the
[1:02:05] preacher can't even preach boy I'm
[1:02:08] telling you we had a time man alive we
[1:02:11] is doing walls of Jericho and marching
[1:02:13] around this and jumping and leaping over
[1:02:16] the tops of the pews and we was doing
[1:02:18] this and that and other Paul said
[1:02:20] what did the word of God come out from
[1:02:23] you and out from you only let any man
[1:02:26] acknowledge if he thinks himself to be a
[1:02:30] spiritual that what I say are the words
[1:02:34] of the
[1:02:35] Lord now you imagine when he went to
[1:02:37] correcting the Corinthian people on
[1:02:39] their gifts and some of the sisters now
[1:02:42] remember some of these women they were
[1:02:45] formerly goddesses
[1:02:47] goddesses they were worshiped in the
[1:02:50] Greek culture now part of their religion
[1:02:52] was they would have sex acts in their
[1:02:55] religion
[1:02:56] so when they would worship these Idols
[1:02:59] they would have these things so some of
[1:03:00] the sisters that were in the Corinthian
[1:03:03] Church now born again they were former
[1:03:07] prostitutes and they gave themselves at
[1:03:10] the house of Diana or the house of some
[1:03:14] of these other gods and goddesses so
[1:03:16] then when they get saved you know
[1:03:18] they've got this thing about them they
[1:03:20] want to they want to give their all to
[1:03:21] the Lord now they're ashamed of their
[1:03:24] backline they're so was shame so they
[1:03:27] come to the Corinthian Church and boy I
[1:03:28] mean it's a gungho Pentecostal one my I
[1:03:32] imagine their music was just loud and
[1:03:34] Fast and they had tambourines and they
[1:03:37] had all kinds of
[1:03:39] little oh boy and it was it was really a
[1:03:42] drawing card to a lot of them boy some
[1:03:44] of them former prostitutes come in there
[1:03:47] for some of them former Idol worshippers
[1:03:49] and boy they love that worship they love
[1:03:53] that singing and my my they' set their
[1:03:55] somebody jump up and start speaking in
[1:03:57] tongues and then think what in the world
[1:04:00] I ain't never seen nothing like this in
[1:04:01] my life and there was something about it
[1:04:05] that Satan knows exactly how to when he
[1:04:08] sees the Dynamics of a church being
[1:04:11] molded and made by the personalities of
[1:04:14] the type of people that it draws and
[1:04:17] Satan can see the direction that God is
[1:04:20] going to move with that church and then
[1:04:23] he will start setting up his war of how
[1:04:27] to attack that church now if he can't
[1:04:29] keep them from being spiritual so-called
[1:04:33] all he's got to do is just push them
[1:04:35] over the edge a we bit toward
[1:04:40] fanaticism now I grant you myself I
[1:04:44] would rather have a little bit of
[1:04:46] wildfire than no fire at all come on now
[1:04:51] you go to preaching against the real
[1:04:53] emotion of God it don't take but about
[1:04:56] that much preaching against it and
[1:04:58] you'll silence the whole church and
[1:05:00] people think well we don't want no
[1:05:01] Wildfire around here I understand that a
[1:05:04] lot of message folks don't want no
[1:05:05] Wildfire so they put out every Fire
[1:05:07] coming and going because they don't know
[1:05:10] what Wildfire is and what true fire is
[1:05:12] so they just come to church sit there
[1:05:14] like a bump on a pickle and they sleep
[1:05:16] halfway through church some of them fix
[1:05:18] the tractor some of them fix their lawn
[1:05:19] more some of them's fixing lasagna
[1:05:21] they're making a chocolate cake and
[1:05:23] they're going to kabas after church we
[1:05:25] ought not to be baking no cake when
[1:05:27] we're in the house of God leave you
[1:05:29] lawnmower tore up leave you tractor tore
[1:05:33] up come on somebody we're here to have
[1:05:35] church today and if the Lord pours out
[1:05:38] his anointing and we go to acting like a
[1:05:41] bunch of Corinthians well I say send it
[1:05:43] on Lord Jesus if the Lord wants us to
[1:05:46] make more act like at the Ephesian
[1:05:48] Church whatever I don't know how you
[1:05:50] feel about it this service ain't mine no
[1:05:53] way and it ain't yours it don't Belong
[1:05:56] To You Well I want it to go this way
[1:05:58] when you become God then you can tell us
[1:06:01] how the service needs to go but until
[1:06:04] you do we want to follow the leading of
[1:06:07] the Holy
[1:06:09] Ghost
[1:06:12] amen now when you look at the issues in
[1:06:15] the New Testament churches that was just
[1:06:17] a preview of the last 15 years but I've
[1:06:19] been studying on this subject but when
[1:06:21] you go to looking at it and them finding
[1:06:24] their position and wanting to be what
[1:06:26] God made them to be there's always going
[1:06:28] to be similarities and you're going to
[1:06:30] find people that you honor they're your
[1:06:32] mentors and you want to be them you see
[1:06:34] that was a danger that me having a a
[1:06:36] background formerly in Pentecost and the
[1:06:39] prophet said that we take on one
[1:06:40] another's spirit so you this person
[1:06:43] you'll make them your mentor and they're
[1:06:46] they're really emotional or estatic or
[1:06:48] maybe they're the astute type and they
[1:06:49] don't move and they don't worship and
[1:06:51] they come to the house of God and
[1:06:52] depending on your makeup you will lean
[1:06:55] to toward one or the other instead of
[1:06:57] being what God wants you to be now God
[1:07:01] may not actually let you be what you
[1:07:03] want to be more than likely won't he'll
[1:07:06] more than likely cause you to be
[1:07:08] something that you're not actually you
[1:07:11] know preferably that you want to be now
[1:07:13] that does not mean that God not does not
[1:07:16] use us in the way that he's made us now
[1:07:20] this was the Insight that the prophet
[1:07:22] gave us and we'll get to it hopefully
[1:07:23] here today but whenever the Ephesian
[1:07:26] Church the great church of Ephesus now
[1:07:30] whenever you compare how many verses and
[1:07:33] chapters is in the book of Ephesians
[1:07:35] very few they did not get the second
[1:07:38] book of Ephesians third book of
[1:07:40] Ephesians as a matter of fact they only
[1:07:42] got one book and it only had a few
[1:07:45] chapters now that's quite an outstanding
[1:07:47] thing about the spirituality of that
[1:07:50] church same with the church at colassi
[1:07:53] yet when you look at the book of
[1:07:55] Corinthians you got First Corinthians
[1:07:57] many many chapters and verses and then
[1:07:59] you've got second Corinthians which is
[1:08:01] written about 5 years later and Paul was
[1:08:04] able to shorten the amount of chapters
[1:08:08] because they had finally become more
[1:08:10] stable the man that was living with his
[1:08:13] stepmother got straightened out and Paul
[1:08:15] said that he did not want to whip him
[1:08:17] you know and some people they look at
[1:08:19] and say oh my we can't say nothing
[1:08:21] against this because it might hurt
[1:08:23] somebody's feelings but you also got to
[1:08:25] realize if you don't say something about
[1:08:27] it the devil's looking for an entryway
[1:08:29] into the church so it takes the spirit
[1:08:32] of God to lead men of God to know when
[1:08:35] they've said enough and to keep their
[1:08:37] mouth shut when they don't need to say
[1:08:38] anything and the church said so you
[1:08:42] imagine what a responsibility then down
[1:08:44] Through the Ages since the New Testament
[1:08:46] that pastors and ministers have really
[1:08:48] had to be able to do now I I find this
[1:08:52] so overwhelming that whenever Paul ter
[1:08:55] with me if you would Ephesians 5:22 that
[1:08:57] Paul writing to this great deep
[1:09:00] revelated church at Ephesus and they
[1:09:03] understood predestination they
[1:09:04] understood election no doubt they
[1:09:06] understood the Redemptive power of the
[1:09:08] blood of the Lord Jesus just great
[1:09:10] things because Paul doesn't have to deal
[1:09:12] with it at all so we can assume by that
[1:09:15] not not being preached that they had a
[1:09:18] really good understanding but notice
[1:09:21] what they lacked Ephesians 5:22
[1:09:27] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[1:09:31] husbands as unto the
[1:09:34] Lord so you mean a revelated daughter of
[1:09:37] God that can understand predestination
[1:09:39] and election and maybe the marriage of
[1:09:42] the lamb and so many wonderful things
[1:09:45] but yet she can struggle with her
[1:09:47] position to her husband now remember
[1:09:50] what the New Testament done it liberated
[1:09:53] a lot of the women on under the law and
[1:09:57] brought the women from a place of
[1:09:59] basically a piece of
[1:10:02] property to where she is also filled
[1:10:06] with the Holy Ghost just like the men
[1:10:08] are and that God could actually speak in
[1:10:12] tongues to her and prophesy through her
[1:10:15] which is unheard of basically in the Old
[1:10:17] Testament except for prophetesses so
[1:10:20] it's only a Selected Few that God did
[1:10:22] that there but it elevated the women in
[1:10:26] the New Testament to where that they
[1:10:28] were Daughters of God now if you go to
[1:10:31] the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem you'll
[1:10:33] still find of course they have a a great
[1:10:35] curtain I was stood there several years
[1:10:37] ago and the men will be on the left left
[1:10:39] hand side facing the Wailing Wall and
[1:10:41] the women will be on the right hand side
[1:10:43] they still separate to this day some of
[1:10:45] the churches in Africa still do the same
[1:10:47] thing but we know that God brought men
[1:10:50] and women both into one baptism of the
[1:10:54] spirit of God and that's why Paul would
[1:10:56] say that in Christ Jesus there is
[1:10:59] neither male nor female but that does
[1:11:01] not change the gender that God would
[1:11:04] allow women to preach so you think of
[1:11:07] this great deep church at Ephesus and
[1:11:11] yet he had to write to them this simple
[1:11:14] something You' think any daughter of God
[1:11:16] would know wives submit yourselves unto
[1:11:21] your own husbands as unto the Lord so
[1:11:26] wives submit now not be a slave not be a
[1:11:29] slave but submit to your own husbands as
[1:11:35] unto the Lord for the husband is the
[1:11:38] head of the wife well shouldn't any
[1:11:41] woman with the Holy Ghost know this well
[1:11:43] apparently there was a need in Ephesus
[1:11:46] for this to be brought back to their
[1:11:49] understanding say they' remembered it
[1:11:50] maybe they forgot it maybe they got away
[1:11:52] from it we don't know even as Christ is
[1:11:56] the head of the church now being a
[1:11:57] prophet he's going to bring it in
[1:11:59] parabolic form and in symbol form to
[1:12:02] help the sisters to see and no doubt
[1:12:05] they did as it has helped us through the
[1:12:07] ages to be able to see as Christ is
[1:12:10] subject to his church or rather the
[1:12:13] church subject to him and there's things
[1:12:15] that Christ says for us to do that we
[1:12:17] don't understand it we just flat don't
[1:12:20] understand it but we don't have to do it
[1:12:22] when we understand it we do it when he
[1:12:25] makes it known and then sometimes later
[1:12:28] he tells us why sometimes he don't but
[1:12:30] we just do it because he is our head now
[1:12:35] notice for the husband is the head of
[1:12:36] the wife even as Christ is the head of
[1:12:38] the church he is the savior of the body
[1:12:42] now you imagine the daughters of God now
[1:12:45] in the city of Ephesus another great
[1:12:46] City uh many Gentiles and whenever they
[1:12:50] saw this and it was received to them of
[1:12:52] course in Greek and it been translated
[1:12:54] to us in the English says a little bit
[1:12:56] different the Greek to the
[1:12:57] transliteration but it's still very
[1:12:59] close but whenever they got this and the
[1:13:02] daughters of God s there they thought
[1:13:03] that is so beautiful that's wonderful so
[1:13:06] the husband is the head of the wife even
[1:13:08] as Christ is the head of the church and
[1:13:10] he is the savior of the body so the
[1:13:13] daughters of God that were may be having
[1:13:15] a hard time with the headship of their
[1:13:17] husband could realize so my husband a
[1:13:20] true Son of God if I am married to a
[1:13:22] true Son of God then it's not like that
[1:13:24] he's is going to be my boss and I and
[1:13:26] I'm I'm a slave under him but God's
[1:13:29] actually put him there to help me
[1:13:32] through life to help me through
[1:13:34] decisions that I'm going to make in life
[1:13:37] therefore as the church is subject unto
[1:13:40] Christ so let the wives be to their own
[1:13:44] husbands and whatever things that they
[1:13:46] agree with their husbands in and then
[1:13:49] all those things and the wives can say
[1:13:53] Amen oh I'm sorry I'm I'm quoting from
[1:13:55] the word of life version aren't
[1:13:58] I oh my so let the wives be to their own
[1:14:02] husbands say it with me
[1:14:08] sisters a brother say kind of weak can
[1:14:11] y'all help me out Brothers say it with
[1:14:13] me
[1:14:15] in ain't that amazing how much louder
[1:14:18] them men
[1:14:20] were some of your brothers have been
[1:14:22] wanting to say that for years ain't you
[1:14:28] now sisters you read these next four
[1:14:31] words with me
[1:14:38] husbands
[1:14:40] even
[1:14:43] as Christ loved the
[1:14:48] church now you think men may have a
[1:14:51] great advantage over the
[1:14:54] women being that they're the head of the
[1:14:56] home and the wives are to be subject to
[1:14:59] them but I want you to listen to this
[1:15:01] next verse how the husbands are supposed
[1:15:04] to love their
[1:15:06] wives as Christ loved the
[1:15:11] church
[1:15:12] and gave
[1:15:15] himself for
[1:15:18] it now listen what kind of a husband
[1:15:22] then that a man that believes this word
[1:15:26] ought to be that he ought to love his
[1:15:28] wife even
[1:15:31] as Christ loved the church and gave
[1:15:35] himself for
[1:15:36] it so how did Christ do what did he do
[1:15:41] when we was unworthy we were undeserving
[1:15:44] now why in the world would a deep Church
[1:15:47] which understood Redemption and mercy
[1:15:49] and predestination and election why in
[1:15:51] the world would they need to hear this
[1:15:54] maybe it was their former life maybe it
[1:15:57] was coming out from Judaism there was a
[1:15:59] mixture of Jews there coming out from
[1:16:01] Judaism and remember by the time the
[1:16:03] Lord Jesus come on the earth there was
[1:16:05] two great teachers that had come along
[1:16:08] uh uh teaching marriage and divorce and
[1:16:10] all of that and most of the disciples
[1:16:12] were actually Pharisees so when Jesus
[1:16:15] began to preach on marriage and divorce
[1:16:17] and the disciples heard this and Jesus
[1:16:19] said whosoever putteth away his wife
[1:16:21] saving for the cause of fornication
[1:16:23] causeth her to commit adultery and then
[1:16:25] in Mark Mark pins it and said whosoever
[1:16:28] puts away his wife and marries another
[1:16:30] commits adultery and when the disciples
[1:16:34] heard this they said it's good for a man
[1:16:37] not to even get married if that's the
[1:16:39] case you ever wonder why they said that
[1:16:43] because the upbringing that they had
[1:16:45] been under Judaism for years and years
[1:16:47] let me tell you how they were under the
[1:16:49] SK the schooling of some of these rabbis
[1:16:52] they taught that if the wife raised her
[1:16:55] voice to the Mother-in-law or the
[1:16:58] father-in-law or burnt the
[1:17:01] bread her husband had a right to put her
[1:17:03] away and marry
[1:17:06] another Carol honey ain't you glad that
[1:17:08] law don't in God's
[1:17:12] word I was eating Cajun blackened before
[1:17:15] it was
[1:17:19] popular some of your brothers don't have
[1:17:22] to move just just sit there and just nod
[1:17:24] your head I know you
[1:17:27] understand but now look when Jesus comes
[1:17:30] he changes that totally he said that was
[1:17:32] not what Moses said God gave you that
[1:17:36] writing of divorce but because of the
[1:17:38] hardness of your hearts it was never
[1:17:41] God's will so the disciples said well if
[1:17:44] that's the way it is a man's better off
[1:17:45] not to even get married so can you
[1:17:48] imagine how that their thinking of their
[1:17:51] wives is going to be changed so you're a
[1:17:53] Jew and you come to Christian ity and
[1:17:55] then your wife gets the Holy Ghost just
[1:17:57] like you right you are supposed to love
[1:18:01] your wife the way Christ Jesus loves the
[1:18:05] church are you kidding me when basically
[1:18:08] their wives were no more than a donkey
[1:18:11] or a horse or a sheep or a cow so if you
[1:18:16] got tired of the cow what would you do
[1:18:17] You' take her to the market and seller
[1:18:19] her so you get rid of her well the woman
[1:18:22] had no say as far as property the woman
[1:18:26] had no say as far as in the home you
[1:18:29] imagine how that some of those Jewish
[1:18:31] converts must have just shuddered
[1:18:34] whenever Paul wrote it in the New
[1:18:36] Testament that the woman was to
[1:18:40] guide the
[1:18:42] house
[1:18:44] guide yes sir now you see we're Gentiles
[1:18:47] and we're living under 2,000 years of
[1:18:50] this but there was Jews there and they
[1:18:52] must have read this and said what is
[1:18:54] wrong wrong with this man ain't no woman
[1:18:57] got in my house I'm the boss here I do
[1:19:00] this I'm afraid we still got some Jews
[1:19:03] in the
[1:19:05] message well
[1:19:08] Hallelujah you see if a man really loves
[1:19:11] his wife as Christ loved the church then
[1:19:15] if he's married to a daughter of God she
[1:19:18] will not struggle to be able to be
[1:19:21] submissive to that type of a man because
[1:19:24] even whenever he will say no honey you
[1:19:26] know I I don't think we need to do this
[1:19:28] or do that she knows he's not doing it
[1:19:32] from a self-centered selfish motive but
[1:19:35] he's actually looking at the betterment
[1:19:38] of the home the betterment of the unity
[1:19:41] of the family of what God wants and
[1:19:43] that's the way we love the Lord Jesus is
[1:19:45] it not we've all prayed prayers and the
[1:19:48] Lord Jesus didn't answer the maybe the
[1:19:50] way we we thought he should or maybe he
[1:19:53] didn't answer it in the time frame that
[1:19:55] we thought he should but if we trust him
[1:19:58] we believe him and we trust him even
[1:20:01] when we don't understanding oh there's
[1:20:04] so many things he's done in my life that
[1:20:07] I have not understood it and I may never
[1:20:11] understand it but I trust his headship
[1:20:14] better than my own reasoning because my
[1:20:17] reasoning sometimes is lying to me and
[1:20:20] so is yours but you imagine now that
[1:20:24] these ISS issues were there in this deep
[1:20:27] deep church now husbands love your wives
[1:20:29] even as Christ also loved the church and
[1:20:32] gave himself forth so this is our
[1:20:34] example brothers that we love our wives
[1:20:38] as Christ loved the church and we would
[1:20:40] be willing to give ourselves for our
[1:20:43] wives oh brother Donnie I would do that
[1:20:46] I'll tell you one thing if anybody
[1:20:47] walked in the church this morning with a
[1:20:49] gun and said I'm going to kill somebody
[1:20:51] and they're pointing to you and your
[1:20:52] wife I give my life for yeah that's
[1:20:54] that's a great heroic trait I'm not
[1:20:57] talking about you men doing this as
[1:21:01] Heroes I'm talking about you doing it
[1:21:04] every day at home that's right when
[1:21:05] nobody knows anything about
[1:21:08] it that's when it gets a little bit
[1:21:10] harder ain't it amen's not required they
[1:21:13] are appreciated
[1:21:15] though watch again now in Ephesians
[1:21:18] chapter 6 verse4 and ye
[1:21:21] fathers provoke not your children to
[1:21:26] rest so here was some of these deep
[1:21:29] fathers in The Message Church of
[1:21:33] Ephesus man what understanding of
[1:21:35] election what understanding of the great
[1:21:37] mercy of God but some of them men still
[1:21:41] did not know how apparently to be able
[1:21:44] to correct their children so in doing it
[1:21:47] they were making them
[1:21:50] mad and actually the fathers the head of
[1:21:54] the home home were provoking their
[1:21:57] children to
[1:22:02] anger
[1:22:04] wow and you fathers provoke not your
[1:22:08] children to
[1:22:10] WRA bring them up in the nurture and
[1:22:14] admonition of the Lord you mean to tell
[1:22:17] me there was some people there that
[1:22:18] wasn't even doing that
[1:22:21] right oh my now we all remember the
[1:22:25] great man Moses what a great prophet of
[1:22:27] God he was and yet Moses got so caught
[1:22:30] up that's right in his position that he
[1:22:33] forgot to circumcise his own
[1:22:36] son wow so you mean we can worry about
[1:22:40] the lost and worry about doing Mission
[1:22:43] work and worry about doing this and that
[1:22:45] and other for the kingdom of God and
[1:22:48] forget our own children our own nephews
[1:22:51] our own nieces our own homes and the
[1:22:54] church
[1:22:55] said let's look also at the church of
[1:22:58] colossia 3:18
[1:23:01] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[1:23:04] husbands as it is
[1:23:08] fit in the
[1:23:10] Lord I love the way he wrote this as it
[1:23:14] is
[1:23:15] fit or
[1:23:18] appropriate so if your husband is not a
[1:23:21] real word believer and ask you to do
[1:23:24] things that are contrary to the
[1:23:27] word you're not subject to that you obey
[1:23:31] them as it is fit in the lord well my
[1:23:34] husband's not a Believer and he wants me
[1:23:35] to wear this and that and the other he
[1:23:37] wants me to cut my hair he wants me to
[1:23:38] put makeup that's not fit for a daughter
[1:23:40] of
[1:23:41] god notice husbands love your wives and
[1:23:46] be not
[1:23:48] bitter wow be not
[1:23:52] bitter against them now we will not ask
[1:23:55] for the showing of hands on any of these
[1:23:58] verses I will be a merciful and faithful
[1:24:01] pastor this morning no commitments being
[1:24:04] made believe me the smiles and the
[1:24:07] frowns are already
[1:24:08] enough so again what a deep revelated
[1:24:13] Church th this is the church in chapter
[1:24:15] one oh my verse 15 we're expresses the
[1:24:19] great mystery of God in the godhead
[1:24:21] where the prophet's textt from in chist
[1:24:24] Myster of God reveal chapter 2 verse 9
[1:24:27] when he goes to bringing in all the
[1:24:29] great deep things of God chapter 3 verse
[1:24:32] 15 and yet having to be corrected now
[1:24:37] this is not just a passing something but
[1:24:39] aren't you glad that God allowed this
[1:24:42] prophet of God to write such things you
[1:24:45] know why you won't find these exact
[1:24:47] words nowhere else in the New Testament
[1:24:51] it all depends on how we look at
[1:24:53] correction you know we can take
[1:24:55] Corrections oh my oh that was so hard
[1:24:58] that was so difficult but out of
[1:25:00] Correction God can do so many wonderful
[1:25:04] things how many wives have come to their
[1:25:06] place in Christ Jesus by reading these
[1:25:09] passages of scripture for the last 2,000
[1:25:12] years how many husbands had had dealt
[1:25:14] with bitterness now Paul does not go
[1:25:16] into the detail of what was causing the
[1:25:18] men in that day and I find it amazing
[1:25:22] that he didn't turn it right around and
[1:25:23] tell the wives not to be bitter against
[1:25:26] their husbands itn't this strange that
[1:25:29] in certain cultures and in certain
[1:25:31] regions even that there will be things
[1:25:33] that will need to be dealt with but
[1:25:35] don't need to be dealt with everywhere
[1:25:37] else husbands love your wives and be not
[1:25:40] bitter against them
[1:25:43] children obey your parents in all things
[1:25:48] for this is well pleasing unto the Lord
[1:25:53] father Here We Go Again fathers now
[1:25:56] brother D what are you talking about I
[1:25:58] thought you was talking about a Ministry
[1:26:00] I am I'm talking about your ministry at
[1:26:04] home you see being a husband is a
[1:26:08] Ministry being a father is a Ministry
[1:26:11] being a wife is a Ministry being even a
[1:26:14] child under the headship of your father
[1:26:18] you are learning your ministry or you
[1:26:20] say I can't wait till I get out and get
[1:26:22] married I'll do this and other well I'll
[1:26:24] tell you what you could be a whole lot
[1:26:26] better daddy if you've got a Godly one
[1:26:28] and you watch how he does he'll be able
[1:26:31] to spare you so much stuff I've watched
[1:26:34] preachers ever since I got in church and
[1:26:36] ever since I got saved especially after
[1:26:38] I become one and I watch preachers and
[1:26:41] and watch decisions that they make and
[1:26:43] watch how they handle scenarios bad ones
[1:26:46] good ones and different ones and all
[1:26:48] that and those are in the middle too so
[1:26:50] you can be able to learn I can learn by
[1:26:52] reading the word yes I can learn by
[1:26:54] listening to tapes and I do that but
[1:26:56] I've also learned it by watching Men
[1:26:58] especially men in position and
[1:27:00] Leadership that it might help me in my
[1:27:02] life and my own position and God knows
[1:27:05] that so this is why that he wants us to
[1:27:07] have Godly fathers Godly mothers and
[1:27:10] that our little children they learn the
[1:27:13] way other nature does so wonder how all
[1:27:16] the antelope on the plains of East
[1:27:19] Africa in the Serengeti where I've stood
[1:27:22] there a couple of times and look at tens
[1:27:25] of thousands times thousands of bbba of
[1:27:31] Impala of dier of all kinds of all these
[1:27:34] things and yet all those Acres that I've
[1:27:37] drove across years and years ago and go
[1:27:40] up in a hot air balloon and fly for
[1:27:43] several miles over the top of the
[1:27:45] elephants and the zebra and the giraffe
[1:27:48] and all that and I never saw one zebra
[1:27:50] school and I never saw one elephant
[1:27:53] School school now I saw the villages in
[1:27:56] the Messiah Mara and I saw the Messiah
[1:27:59] people there but I never saw one BBU
[1:28:03] College I never saw one Impala school
[1:28:06] well wonder how them little Impala
[1:28:09] learned to be able within a matter of
[1:28:12] minutes when they are born whenever they
[1:28:14] go to moving in this transitory time the
[1:28:17] largest migration on the entire face of
[1:28:20] the Earth and it's amazing how that
[1:28:23] these these mothers will give birth in
[1:28:26] this migration you got to be kidding me
[1:28:28] so in migration tens of thousands of
[1:28:32] little babies are being born all over
[1:28:34] the serengetti Plains and them babies
[1:28:37] are dropped and in a matter of minutes
[1:28:40] they've got to be able to run like crazy
[1:28:43] because the Lions also know it's baby
[1:28:47] dropping time and so do the Cheetahs so
[1:28:50] do the wild dogs so do the leopards and
[1:28:53] them babies are so designed unlike us as
[1:28:56] babies we can't run we can't walk we
[1:28:59] can't crawl but God made them in the
[1:29:02] time of danger so they would be able to
[1:29:05] get up off of that ground after their
[1:29:07] mother gives birth to them and take off
[1:29:09] running some of them 45 to 50 miles an
[1:29:13] hour and they've been carried in their
[1:29:15] mother's belly for all those months and
[1:29:18] the first time they use their legs may
[1:29:20] be running from a wild dog or a cheetah
[1:29:23] now what did God do God provided for
[1:29:26] them and then whenever a zebra baby is
[1:29:29] born the mother will shield her little
[1:29:32] baby from all the rest of the zebras now
[1:29:34] remember there's thousands of them
[1:29:35] giving birth at one time that mother
[1:29:38] stripes and her spots are unique to
[1:29:42] herself they've never found two of them
[1:29:44] that are identical so that mother will
[1:29:46] give birth to her little baby zebra and
[1:29:49] she will keep herself from the rest of
[1:29:51] the herd and that little baby will set
[1:29:54] sat there and look at her and the
[1:29:55] imprint of his mama Stripes will be on
[1:29:58] him it is a permanent marker he will
[1:30:02] know the way she her voice is and he
[1:30:05] will see that imprint he will go out and
[1:30:07] play with all of his little zebra
[1:30:09] buddies and they all come back but you
[1:30:11] know what they're looking for they're
[1:30:13] looking for mama if a baby zebra can do
[1:30:16] that what about a seed of God that's
[1:30:18] lost out there in the world but God puts
[1:30:21] an imprint on you it's called a predes
[1:30:24] destinated seed and there ain't enough
[1:30:26] devils in hell to keep you away from the
[1:30:28] imprint of your
[1:30:31] father oh
[1:30:33] my now think of the children that we we
[1:30:36] long to be spiritual and we long to be
[1:30:39] great things but we think well just
[1:30:42] being a daddy what's that got to do and
[1:30:44] being a mother what's that got to do and
[1:30:46] you know being honest in my business and
[1:30:48] what's that got to do that is part of
[1:30:50] your
[1:30:52] ministry watch this the prophet talking
[1:30:54] about his wife and he said I said Lord
[1:30:56] she didn't mean what she did that
[1:30:58] morning now brother Randon was talking
[1:31:00] about sister mey and she was very
[1:31:03] disrespectful to brother Brandon you
[1:31:05] remember the story and it was about
[1:31:08] correcting their son their youngest son
[1:31:10] Joseph and she said if you was here you
[1:31:12] would do this and that and other she
[1:31:14] raised her voice to brother brandom you
[1:31:16] know he went on out she slam the door
[1:31:18] and he said the Lord spoke to him and
[1:31:20] told him he washing his car told him to
[1:31:22] to go read the scripture in the book of
[1:31:24] numbers so he comes back and he tells
[1:31:26] her that oh Bill Bill he said mey the
[1:31:29] lord gave me
[1:31:31] something so he said you should not have
[1:31:33] said
[1:31:34] that sometime later she develops this
[1:31:38] tumor in her body remember friends God
[1:31:43] says touch not my anointed and do my
[1:31:46] prophets no harm if God would allow this
[1:31:51] to happen to the prophet's wife I feel
[1:31:54] sorry for the people in this age that
[1:31:57] are calling this prophet of God a liar
[1:31:59] and a deceiver it's going to be rough
[1:32:03] I'm telling you it's going to be
[1:32:05] bad now what so she's at this stage and
[1:32:10] that this tor is getting bigger and
[1:32:12] bigger now now brother renham found it
[1:32:14] by accident he was talking to someone
[1:32:17] and said brother renham how does that
[1:32:18] work cuz the Lord in the early stage of
[1:32:20] his ministry gave him a gift and he'd
[1:32:22] take his hand or take the Pati's hand
[1:32:24] and put on on his hand and and bumps
[1:32:27] would start breaking out on the on his
[1:32:29] body and then it would come to him
[1:32:31] exactly what was wrong with the
[1:32:32] individual so he was talking to his
[1:32:34] sister she said that is so marvelous how
[1:32:36] does that work I said well sister he's
[1:32:38] explaining to her and said just works
[1:32:39] like this and said now look at mey she
[1:32:41] she ain't got nothing wrong with her and
[1:32:43] as soon as he took mey's hand and laid
[1:32:45] on his hand he said you've got a tumor
[1:32:48] in the
[1:32:50] over so it got bigger and bigger and I
[1:32:53] want you to notice now how brother Bram
[1:32:54] is approaching God on behalf of his wife
[1:32:59] Lord she didn't mean that Lord not one
[1:33:01] time as she ever said one word about me
[1:33:03] going in the meeting stay months and
[1:33:06] whatever it was not one time as she ever
[1:33:08] opened her mouth about it she was always
[1:33:10] sent my clothes to the cleaners and
[1:33:12] washed my shirts and had everything
[1:33:14] ready to go in the meeting and then she
[1:33:17] wonders how she can serve God you women
[1:33:21] as you serve your husband
[1:33:24] you serve God of
[1:33:27] course now remember maybe some of you
[1:33:29] sisters sent your day and you say but
[1:33:31] brother Dy my husband is
[1:33:32] gone the Lord took him well maybe that
[1:33:35] aspect of your ministry is stopped for
[1:33:37] some others they might get remarried to
[1:33:40] another man it'll continue on that way
[1:33:42] but remember you still have a
[1:33:45] Ministry don't think because God takes
[1:33:48] your husband or your wife you don't
[1:33:50] still have a Ministry you still do it
[1:33:54] might be ministering to other widows but
[1:33:56] let me tell you this as a warning one of
[1:33:59] the worst things you can do when you
[1:34:01] suffer a tragic loss is pull yourself in
[1:34:05] to it's only about you and your world is
[1:34:10] about you God never saves any of us
[1:34:14] without giving us something to do to
[1:34:17] help the
[1:34:18] body now watch you women as you serve
[1:34:21] your husband you serve God of course and
[1:34:23] now then when I come in all tired and
[1:34:25] worn out people coming from everywhere
[1:34:27] and I have to go out somewhere on a
[1:34:29] fishing trip or a hunting trip why many
[1:34:32] women would have blowed up at that
[1:34:34] what'd she do got my hunting clothes
[1:34:37] ready for me to go now not just so
[1:34:40] happens and I'm reading this close to
[1:34:42] hunting season
[1:34:45] either I said Lord she didn't mean that
[1:34:49] and I said she had to be cut open three
[1:34:52] times on account of Shan now want you to
[1:34:55] notice how the prophet is intervening
[1:34:58] you said this is one aspect of a prophet
[1:35:01] that a lot of these blind Le ofans don't
[1:35:03] understand you look at the Old Testament
[1:35:05] and you see that prophets are given a
[1:35:08] position of intercessory prayer to
[1:35:11] intercede for kings and for
[1:35:14] Nations you understand what America did
[1:35:17] God sent America her own prophet he
[1:35:21] could have interceded for her
[1:35:24] but she turned him
[1:35:27] down oh
[1:35:29] my so notice he said she had to be cut
[1:35:32] open three times on account of cyrian
[1:35:34] and I said Lord I I hate to see her have
[1:35:36] to go through that again CU they're
[1:35:38] going to have to do a surgery
[1:35:40] order and what did God
[1:35:43] do he kneels down and res by himself
[1:35:48] he's fixing to drive to
[1:35:50] spport and said Lord I'm So Lonesome for
[1:35:53] him they had a little foot stool he said
[1:35:55] they'd all kneel down and
[1:35:57] pray oh
[1:35:59] my and he was afraid he might lose her
[1:36:03] why lost his first
[1:36:06] one we all know how that is don't we
[1:36:09] when Satan will try to bring fear and
[1:36:12] grip your heart but the mercy of God
[1:36:14] come and said whatever you
[1:36:17] say and he said before the doctor ever
[1:36:20] touches her let it be gone that's right
[1:36:24] now remember she didn't know this was
[1:36:26] going on but the prophet is now
[1:36:29] interceding for his
[1:36:32] wife and God heard his prayer I believe
[1:36:36] there are still people that can
[1:36:38] intercede for us don't you now look how
[1:36:41] important it was now if iall want you to
[1:36:43] notice brother Ram never mentions to God
[1:36:47] how many times sister mey spoke in
[1:36:50] tongues he never mentions to God how
[1:36:53] many time she shouted she ran she jumped
[1:36:56] she D she may have done all that I I I
[1:36:58] really don't
[1:37:00] know but whenever he's bringing to God
[1:37:04] that which would say now Lord she's done
[1:37:06] this and this and this is why I I don't
[1:37:09] I I don't don't do this don't allow this
[1:37:12] to happen to what does he
[1:37:14] mention washing
[1:37:20] shirts taking his
[1:37:22] clothes to the dry
[1:37:25] cleaners
[1:37:27] wow but do we look at such things as
[1:37:31] being
[1:37:34] spiritual or do we say what you do today
[1:37:39] mop the floors cleaned out the closets
[1:37:41] wash dishes I'm just getting ready to do
[1:37:44] the same thing tomorrow and some of you
[1:37:46] women might get so bored with the
[1:37:49] drudgery of life I some of you men get
[1:37:53] so bored with a treasure do you
[1:37:56] understand the Lord God called you to be
[1:38:00] what many women can never be a Godly
[1:38:07] wife a Godly mother oh you say brother
[1:38:11] Donnie there's millions of mothers I
[1:38:13] never said
[1:38:15] mothers I said
[1:38:18] Godly
[1:38:20] mothers Godly wives
[1:38:25] oh speak to us
[1:38:27] Jesus notice this in the adoption oh
[1:38:29] it's glorious to find your
[1:38:31] position and no one can do
[1:38:35] anything oh my unless you properly know
[1:38:39] what you're doing but the purpose of
[1:38:41] this now remember this is the beginning
[1:38:42] of the adoption or the chapter four part
[1:38:44] four of the adoption series the purpose
[1:38:47] of this is seeing your position in
[1:38:48] Christ seeing that it's not something
[1:38:51] that you just stumbled into
[1:38:54] or something that might have you merited
[1:38:56] somewhere but it's what God did for you
[1:38:58] himself amen God did for you himself not
[1:39:04] that you were so good that you went to a
[1:39:06] church one night and some poor old
[1:39:07] brother LED you up to the alar wasn't
[1:39:09] that it was God before the foundation of
[1:39:11] the world predestinated you to eternal
[1:39:14] life this is my purpose of doing this
[1:39:18] the church is always trying to take
[1:39:21] somebody else's
[1:39:24] corner but don't do that you can never
[1:39:28] race corn in ephraim's corner if you're
[1:39:31] a
[1:39:32] manasse you got to take your place in
[1:39:36] Christ positionally take it and now
[1:39:39] after you live that don't mean you're
[1:39:41] free from war you still have to fight
[1:39:44] for every inch of ground you stand on
[1:39:47] and let me just remind you today once
[1:39:49] you get in the land of Canaan you may
[1:39:52] stop fighting to take it but you'll have
[1:39:54] to start fighting to keep it how many's
[1:39:57] ever been healed with something and they
[1:39:59] find that same thing coming right back
[1:40:01] on you again maybe you laid aside a
[1:40:04] besetting sin or something that hadn't
[1:40:06] bothered you in years and yet it comes
[1:40:09] back and some of you let's just be
[1:40:10] honest some of you may have fallen right
[1:40:13] back into the same thing again and you
[1:40:15] say well Lord there ain't no hope for me
[1:40:17] no it means you're in the land and them
[1:40:20] same Devils that you run off before by
[1:40:22] the grace of of God don't give up very
[1:40:25] easy so if you whip pornography at one
[1:40:28] time in your life said boy glory to God
[1:40:30] it'll never bother me again don't you
[1:40:32] think that you have to watch that devil
[1:40:35] he'll come sneaking right back same way
[1:40:37] with your healing the prophet said that
[1:40:40] faith will cast that devil out and kill
[1:40:43] that gross in your body fear and
[1:40:46] unbelief will resurrect it can you
[1:40:49] imagine fear and unbelief having such
[1:40:52] power
[1:40:53] that it could resurrect a dead tumor in
[1:40:57] our bodies no wonder God wants us to
[1:41:00] have such a positive confession somebody
[1:41:03] say amen God wants us to never lose our
[1:41:07] praise if you don't get anything out of
[1:41:10] what I'm saying today other than this
[1:41:11] let me say this to you in the middle of
[1:41:14] your trials in the middle of your test
[1:41:16] don't never lose your praise don't give
[1:41:19] up on your adoration and how you feel
[1:41:22] you may not be able to thank God for
[1:41:25] having a flat tire for coming to church
[1:41:27] but thank God you had a spare and if you
[1:41:30] didn't have a spare thank God you had
[1:41:32] triaa there's always things to thank God
[1:41:36] for no matter what we're going through
[1:41:38] come on somebody and if we're not
[1:41:41] careful we'll let the devil steal our
[1:41:44] praise steal our joy and we're so sad
[1:41:48] and we're so down oh my I believe if
[1:41:51] there was ever a time that we as the
[1:41:54] people of God needed a restoration of
[1:41:57] our joy a restoration of our praise and
[1:42:00] of our worship is now I'm not talking
[1:42:03] about with the music going 90 miles an
[1:42:05] hour I'm talking about you having a
[1:42:08] praise in your heart for the Living God
[1:42:11] he has done so much for every one of us
[1:42:15] we were lost and he found us we were
[1:42:18] wretched and blind and naked and he
[1:42:21] saved us and filled us with him
[1:42:27] Spirit
[1:42:31] oh I love the way he deals with this and
[1:42:33] the type Canaan did not represent the
[1:42:36] great
[1:42:38] Heaven because it's war and troubles and
[1:42:41] killings and fightings and so forth but
[1:42:44] it did represent
[1:42:46] this that it must be a perfect walk
[1:42:53] Joshua said Gad I want you right in your
[1:42:56] lays your place according to the
[1:42:59] blueprint your place lays here right
[1:43:02] here you get in here Gad you stay here
[1:43:05] Benjamin you go right down there oh then
[1:43:10] whenever they find their
[1:43:12] spot they can operate then a housewife
[1:43:16] can come to the house of God she don't
[1:43:17] have to feel ashamed and be embarrassed
[1:43:20] you know you hear Brother Daryl talking
[1:43:21] about the people he's led to the Lord
[1:43:23] hear these other brothers talking about
[1:43:24] they prayed for so and so and this
[1:43:25] happened oh my I don't know of any
[1:43:28] Miracles that I've ever done well maybe
[1:43:30] not but maybe you prayed for brother
[1:43:31] Daryl and God anointed him to do it God
[1:43:34] still used you do you understand the
[1:43:36] Lord don't want any of us to stand
[1:43:38] before him that day with nothing in our
[1:43:41] hands but brother Donnie what have I

[1:46:57] will all work
[1:47:01] right so you see it's not just that we
[1:47:04] get in trouble if we miss
[1:47:06] it let me go this direction then we'll
[1:47:08] close
[1:47:09] here if we serve his
[1:47:13] purpose we will raise in the
[1:47:15] resurrection of
[1:47:17] Life notice this God's creation reflects
[1:47:21] God God made everything for a purpose
[1:47:24] and everything that
[1:47:26] serves God's purpose when it
[1:47:31] dies it has a
[1:47:33] resurrection thank you Lord there is no
[1:47:35] resurrection of life for pontious
[1:47:40] pilot no resurrection of life for
[1:47:44] rameses
[1:47:46] thei no resurrection of life for SAR rib
[1:47:51] that come against the children of Israel
[1:47:54] Nebuchadnezzar nebuch
[1:47:57] caradan no resurrection of
[1:48:00] life and yet all some of you will be
[1:48:03] will be a housewife a
[1:48:07] farmer but you will have a resurrection
[1:48:10] of life and you will enter into the City
[1:48:14] and you will never die and great Kings
[1:48:17] and monarchs and princes and potentates
[1:48:21] and Priests
[1:48:23] your name will never be
[1:48:26] found in the book who's
[1:48:31] who but I'm glad my name has been found
[1:48:34] in God's
[1:48:35] book of who is
[1:48:39] who my name is actually in the book of
[1:48:41] Who's
[1:48:43] Who
[1:48:44] mhm didn't do me no good though I've
[1:48:47] still got it I don't know why they
[1:48:49] wanted to put it in there for it reckon
[1:48:50] redneck hillbilly whatever I'm not sure
[1:48:53] why but they wanted to put my name in
[1:48:55] there under the who's
[1:48:57] who some of y'all shocked a
[1:49:00] you but didn't do no
[1:49:03] good but Jesus wrote my
[1:49:06] name on the palm of his
[1:49:11] hand so he looks over in the condensed
[1:49:14] version and see who's who
[1:49:23] so the rich the wealthy the infamous and
[1:49:26] the famous the important the not so
[1:49:30] important this is really what
[1:49:32] matters if a man serves God's purpose
[1:49:35] there is a
[1:49:37] resurrection just as sure as
[1:49:40] anything I'm going to quote this next
[1:49:42] and it's from the title I am the
[1:49:44] resurrection it's actually preached in
[1:49:47] camville Kentucky formerly this was
[1:49:50] titled Garnet Peaks
[1:49:55] funeral a young boy that was in an iron
[1:50:00] Lum a young boy that never got to be
[1:50:03] married a young boy that never got to do
[1:50:06] much in
[1:50:08] life but his life's dream was to be a
[1:50:12] tobacco
[1:50:15] Auctioneer but he never hardly got to
[1:50:17] play he never hardly got to do
[1:50:20] anything as a mortal much that's what it
[1:50:23] would seem like for
[1:50:26] God now listen these words from this
[1:50:28] boy's funeral service we find out that
[1:50:32] the resurrection only comes when it
[1:50:35] serves God's
[1:50:37] purpose if it doesn't serve God's
[1:50:40] purpose no matter how
[1:50:42] beautiful how pretty it looks how much
[1:50:46] better it might look than some other
[1:50:48] seed that is
[1:50:50] gerti it'll never rise
[1:50:55] it lives this and settles that settles
[1:50:58] it but if it's
[1:51:00] gerti it must rise am
[1:51:10] again so is it my friends we here this
[1:51:13] afternoon to see what death has done to
[1:51:15] our brother about 18 19 years
[1:51:18] old it's got to be gered we might belong
[1:51:21] to church we might might be fine people
[1:51:23] we might be a good character in the
[1:51:25] neighborhood a fine father mother son
[1:51:28] daughter but unless we are germatize
[1:51:30] with the spirit of God will'll never
[1:51:33] rise in the resurrection
[1:51:36] it's finished yes
[1:51:40] sir now you imagine when he goes on into
[1:51:43] this funeral service and he said if
[1:51:45] Garnet doesn't
[1:51:48] rise there is no rising of the Sun
[1:51:53] it would be
[1:51:55] irrational to say that Garnet will not
[1:52:01] rise a little boy that lived in an arm
[1:52:04] lung a little boy that had a poor family
[1:52:06] a little boy that none of his dreams and
[1:52:09] motives and objectives was ever able to
[1:52:11] be
[1:52:13] fulfilled and yet brother brandham
[1:52:15] preached this little boy's funeral if
[1:52:16] you haven't listened to in a while do
[1:52:18] good listen to it he preached this boy's
[1:52:21] funeral as as if he was a
[1:52:24] prince a prince why he caught a
[1:52:28] perspective of
[1:52:30] life that we look at so
[1:52:33] different we look at stocks bonds
[1:52:38] Investments four years of this degree
[1:52:40] and six years of that degree and I've
[1:52:43] got this reputation I'm a CEO I'm a
[1:52:45] whatever oh you know oh i' I've got this
[1:52:48] and I've got that I'm I'm fulfilling my
[1:52:50] dream in life
[1:52:53] and here laid the
[1:52:55] wed poor little body of a poor little
[1:52:59] guy that hardly nobody
[1:53:02] knew but he served God's
[1:53:07] purpose CU a prophet said he had been
[1:53:11] gerti by eternal
[1:53:13] life that's the reason the sun rises it
[1:53:16] because it serves God's purpose and we
[1:53:21] rise
[1:53:23] when we serve God's purpose I believe
[1:53:26] that brother Williams now I referring to
[1:53:28] another man that had passed serve God's
[1:53:30] purpose in life listen what part of the
[1:53:34] purpose
[1:53:35] was a real
[1:53:38] father I see his Darling Companion Mrs
[1:53:42] Williams sitting here a
[1:53:44] real
[1:53:46] husband that's one of God's
[1:53:50] purposes a father other one of God's
[1:53:56] purposes and he was dramatized to God by
[1:54:01] the Holy Spirit God's
[1:54:06] main
[1:54:10] purpose let me close with this if
[1:54:13] everything serve God's
[1:54:16] purpose it's got a
[1:54:19] resurrection but it can only rise up if
[1:54:23] it
[1:54:25] serves God's
[1:54:29] purpose I down the basement yesterday
[1:54:32] listen listen to a
[1:54:37] tape the
[1:54:39] devil come to me like he does to you
[1:54:44] sometimes hey you understand this and
[1:54:47] you understand that you understand why
[1:54:48] God let this happen and that happened
[1:54:50] and that happened
[1:54:53] I said ' nope sure
[1:54:56] don't and he come back and said and you
[1:54:59] still going to serve him
[1:55:02] am you're you're still going to live for
[1:55:04] him you're still going to
[1:55:07] preach I said
[1:55:11] yep he said how can you do that I said
[1:55:15] you wouldn't understand
[1:55:21] [Applause]
[1:55:23] praise the
[1:55:27] Lord oh he don't understand how that you
[1:55:31] can keep on serving him even whenever
[1:55:34] the Lord may not answer your prayer he
[1:55:36] don't understand how you can keep coming
[1:55:38] to church and you may come service after
[1:55:40] service and you may be going through a
[1:55:42] dry spell it seem like you ain't getting
[1:55:44] nothing you said you going back and said
[1:55:45] yep sure him said why I said you
[1:55:47] wouldn't understand it in the first
[1:55:48] place you wouldn't understand it I'm a
[1:55:50] Child of God filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:55:52] I've got something you ain't never got
[1:55:54] something you can't never get well come
[1:55:56] on somebody he's all the time trying to
[1:55:58] jump on you you need to jump on him
[1:56:01] sometime and just wear him out I just
[1:56:04] think the Lord dropped that down in my
[1:56:06] heart so you know what the devil done he
[1:56:08] left me alone I said good Riders get out
[1:56:10] of here and leave me alone you wouldn't
[1:56:12] understand I just started preaching my
[1:56:14] little sermon I paused my tape I started
[1:56:16] preaching those sermon D D devil I put
[1:56:18] my hand over here I said devil let me
[1:56:19] just tell you something old boy you
[1:56:21] don't understand what it's like to serve
[1:56:22] God you don't understand what it's like
[1:56:24] to be filled with the Holy Ghost you
[1:56:26] don't understand I got to feeling pretty
[1:56:27] good I'm feeling pretty good right now
[1:56:29] that's what you need to do sisters go
[1:56:31] ahead and preach to him at your house
[1:56:33] and just tell them you don't understand
[1:56:35] what it's like to be a daughter of God
[1:56:37] who loves the Lord when the Lord did not
[1:56:39] answer my prayer yet my love for him is
[1:56:43] greater than anything I know in this
[1:56:44] world demons he wouldn't understand it
[1:56:47] world you wouldn't understand nothing
[1:56:49] about it why because we have been called
[1:56:52] by God and we are serving God's
[1:56:57] [Applause]
[1:57:06] purpose but brother Donnie I've messed
[1:57:09] up so
[1:57:13] bad now Moses after taking the situation
[1:57:17] in his own hand found out he was a total
[1:57:21] fail
[1:57:24] run from the presence of pharaoh and
[1:57:26] from the presence of God and was a
[1:57:27] stranger for 40 years way back married
[1:57:31] an Ethiopian girl so she had a lot of
[1:57:33] temper Moses had a lot of temper and
[1:57:35] that was his trouble I just imagine
[1:57:38] things wasn't so peaceful on the back
[1:57:41] there of the desert at times but God
[1:57:44] gave it to
[1:57:45] him now if you think you married a woman
[1:57:48] that has a little temper don't nobody
[1:57:49] move don't nobody bat no eyes or nothing
[1:57:52] now I'm not even looking at y'all don't
[1:57:53] y'all look at me now if you think you
[1:57:55] married a woman has a little temper
[1:57:57] maybe God's trying to tame you down a
[1:58:01] little so and vice
[1:58:06] versa so he was a total
[1:58:11] failure it's amazing what God can do
[1:58:14] with total
[1:58:17] failures glory to God so the P was kind
[1:58:21] of high
[1:58:23] she proved it when she cut the foreskin
[1:58:24] from her son and thre it before Moses
[1:58:26] and said thou are a bloody husband to me
[1:58:27] I might imagine things wasn't too
[1:58:29] peaceful at
[1:58:30] times what was he doing schooling into
[1:58:33] the boy's n mind or the man's mind what
[1:58:35] the program of God was let's jump down
[1:58:39] to paragraph 33 Moses had been a total
[1:58:43] failure and maybe there's men here this
[1:58:45] afternoon maybe
[1:58:49] ministers that's been total fail years
[1:58:52] maybe you've been as a
[1:58:54] housewife maybe you've been as a student
[1:58:56] at school a child to your
[1:59:01] parents whatever you've been let that
[1:59:05] be has
[1:59:08] been Oh Glory to God let that be has
[1:59:14] been well what was it when you went to
[1:59:17] church Sunday morning I was a total
[1:59:20] failure but I left with
[1:59:22] hope I had been a failure I had been
[1:59:25] totally messed up I had been really this
[1:59:28] and that and the other but I walked out
[1:59:30] them same doors I walked into I walked
[1:59:33] in with no hope but I walked out hopeful
[1:59:36] I walked in it seemed like I was an
[1:59:38] absolute hopeless case I walked in a
[1:59:41] total failure but I walked out a
[1:59:43] redeemed total failure
[1:59:47] Hallelujah Can We Stand Together
[1:59:50] whatever you have been let that be has
[1:59:54] been and start from today no matter what
[1:59:56] it is maybe you've been a failure as a
[2:00:00] Christian maybe you failed to go on with
[2:00:02] God if it has been take note to what I'm
[2:00:05] going to say in a few
[2:00:07] moments Moses failed down in Egypt when
[2:00:09] he was born he been delivered to bring
[2:00:10] the children of Israel out of Egypt why
[2:00:12] because he did it in
[2:00:15] himself he took it upon himself to do it
[2:00:20] and anytime you take things upon
[2:00:22] yourself and leave God out you're going
[2:00:24] to be a failure like
[2:00:29] Moses
[2:00:31] oh how many wants God to take you today
[2:00:34] and help
[2:00:37] you Moses life consisted of 120 years 40
[2:00:42] Years of it coming up to be taught 40
[2:00:47] years was a total
[2:00:49] failure 40 years then he serve the
[2:00:54] Lord so imagine 80 years 80 years of his
[2:00:59] life that he wasn't serving God with all
[2:01:01] of his
[2:01:02] heart but he done more in them last 40
[2:01:06] than all the damage that the devil done
[2:01:08] in the early
[2:01:11] 80 but brother Donnie is there any hope
[2:01:13] are you
[2:01:14] breathing your heart still pumping
[2:01:17] There's Hope now you can just go ahead
[2:01:21] and get down and water all the mistakes
[2:01:22] and all the fairies if you wish to or
[2:01:25] you can say how much every time I've got
[2:01:29] left I can see him as he stood there
[2:01:31] that day between them two gigantic
[2:01:36] columns in this Auditorium that was
[2:01:38] shaped like a
[2:01:41] mushroom his heart was broken he was
[2:01:46] blinded cuz he' been a
[2:01:49] failure his name was Samson
[2:01:53] he loved one of the daughters of the
[2:01:54] valley of Sak loved
[2:01:57] Delilah the very Nation God had called
[2:02:00] him to deliver his people from and
[2:02:03] finally conquered
[2:02:06] him they chained him and he's going
[2:02:09] around and around and around in circles
[2:02:13] in the Gris Mill of
[2:02:18] Satan you imagine him as they go down
[2:02:20] there and they take them hot poers
[2:02:22] and they burn his eyeballs
[2:02:24] out he can no longer
[2:02:27] see and he's working in the place of a
[2:02:30] mule an
[2:02:33] animal but his hair starts growing
[2:02:37] out tears coming out of those
[2:02:42] sockets that used to contain
[2:02:46] eyes now they want to use him for
[2:02:49] entertainment
[2:02:52] how many former Christians are now
[2:02:55] entertainment at a drunken
[2:03:01] party the prophet said I can see him as
[2:03:03] he can tell that little boy that's
[2:03:05] leading him you imagine they got this
[2:03:07] little b old guy as an act of
[2:03:09] humiliation they don't bring out this
[2:03:10] bronny guy leading Samson but a little
[2:03:13] bitty old
[2:03:15] fella and he leads him up and he ask him
[2:03:19] would you put my hands
[2:03:21] how's this building
[2:03:23] made so he says there's two columns
[2:03:26] right in the
[2:03:28] middle would you put my right hand on
[2:03:30] one and my left hand on the
[2:03:34] other and then he prays this prayer
[2:03:39] Lord once
[2:03:42] more avenge me of my
[2:03:47] eyes Lord I'm so
[2:03:49] sorry I failed you fallen short of the
[2:03:53] glory of
[2:03:55] God and the spirit of God comes on
[2:03:57] Samson and he begins to
[2:03:59] feel as the Holy Ghost goes to moveing
[2:04:02] through his body
[2:04:05] again and he begins to push and all the
[2:04:09] popping and the
[2:04:12] cracking and the Bible tells us that he
[2:04:14] slayed more at his
[2:04:16] deaths and he did through his entire
[2:04:19] life
[2:04:22] a man that was a failure it one like
[2:04:25] that he was a drunk and then he got
[2:04:28] saved and had all these great victories
[2:04:30] he was a leader for God and fell flat on
[2:04:32] his face he was a failure to God and
[2:04:36] God's people but God was not going to
[2:04:39] let his life be crowned with
[2:04:43] such may God allow you to put your hands
[2:04:48] on whatever it is that's ending your
[2:04:50] life
[2:04:54] and the strength of the Holy Ghost if
[2:04:55] it's a habit of besetting sin you're
[2:04:59] past let it be what the prophet called
[2:05:02] it a has
[2:05:05] been a has
[2:05:07] been and forgetting those things which
[2:05:11] are behind
[2:05:12] us let us press toward the mark of the
[2:05:16] High Calling of God which is in Christ
[2:05:19] Jesus
[2:05:22] let's bow our heads
[2:05:26] together

[2:05:40] joy maybe some of you finding yourself
[2:05:43] down in that old grind and Mill of the
[2:05:48] Philistines you're just going around in

[2:07:04] used to be consecrated to God I used to

[2:28:08] Hallelujah you know if there's something
[2:28:10] in
[2:28:11] us that longs for more of him that's the
[2:28:14] evidence that there's more of him for
[2:28:16] you to receive for we know there's a
[2:28:18] deep that calls a to the deep and I'm so
[2:28:21] glad this morning that we're gathered
[2:28:23] here with people we don't desire the
[2:28:25] fame and the riches of the world I don't
[2:28:28] care I don't care if this mayor knows my
[2:28:31] name I don't care if the governor of
[2:28:32] Tennessee knows my name I don't care if
[2:28:34] the president he knows my
[2:28:37] name amen and the god that created the
[2:28:40] heavens and earth has placed a desire in
[2:28:42] you to serve him Amen to be a minister
[2:28:46] oh I haven't enjoyed this so much on the
[2:28:48] ministry we talking back today in the
[2:28:51] study and I told brother Donnie I said
[2:28:52] you know one day I believe we'll stand
[2:28:54] there and we'll find out that some of
[2:28:55] these sisters pray and some of these
[2:28:57] things that that was done that we don't
[2:28:58] even know about will be greater than
[2:29:00] some of the ministers who stood behind
[2:29:02] the pull pit I believe that friends amen
[2:29:06] you never know the prayer of a mother
[2:29:08] how it changes a boy's heart somewhere
[2:29:11] God put that on her that's an ability
[2:29:13] for a mother to pray for a child and
[2:29:14] there's always something that we can do
[2:29:17] like the little boy you know that was
[2:29:18] Out on the Ocean we're I know you're
[2:29:19] going to go but he just he Out on the
[2:29:22] Ocean and these these starfish had
[2:29:24] beached theel and thousands of starfish
[2:29:26] was on the beach and the boys picking
[2:29:28] them up and throwing them back in the
[2:29:29] water and this fell said hey little
[2:29:31] buddy what are you doing he said I'm I'm
[2:29:33] helping these starfish I'm I'm I'm I'm
[2:29:35] making a
[2:29:36] difference and he picked it up you know
[2:29:38] and he he said Son look at this there's
[2:29:40] thousands of them up on this beach you
[2:29:42] can never make a difference he picked up
[2:29:45] one and threw it in the water and he
[2:29:46] said I made a difference to that one
[2:29:50] amen sir if I can't reach the world just
[2:29:53] let me reach that one for your name will
[2:29:56] be associated with them throughout
[2:29:59] eternity and you know as I said before
[2:30:02] God don't need something big he just
[2:30:04] needs something
[2:30:06] yielded to give oursel away Lord use me
[2:30:09] whatever capacity Lord you want to use
[2:30:11] me and I give myself to you have you
[2:30:13] enjoyed the word of God Amen so grateful
[2:30:16] for brother dar
[2:30:22] go and enjoy your day enjoy your family
[2:30:24] and meditate upon the things that you've
[2:30:26] heard and if you if he comes up on your
[2:30:28] heart pray for my little buddy my
[2:30:30] grandson Aiden he they named him Aiden
[2:30:33] which means little fire and he's
[2:30:34] certainly living up to that to that name
[2:30:37] he had surgery on Wednesday uh they did
[2:30:39] some surgery on his tongue and his upper
[2:30:41] lip and put I think 10 stitches and he
[2:30:44] fell this morning when they was getting
[2:30:45] ready for church and busted his chin and
[2:30:47] so allly just told me that they glued
[2:30:49] that back together so if you think about
[2:30:52] it just say a little prayer for him and
[2:30:53] pray for these other needs and and I
[2:30:55] tell you something that's and I noticed
[2:30:57] in the last few weeks I I get several
[2:30:58] texts on my phone people some sometimes
[2:31:01] you don't even know who they are but
[2:31:02] they say brother Dar would you pray but
[2:31:04] in the last week or so I've got three or
[2:31:06] four different text from families saying
[2:31:09] please pray for my son or my daughter
[2:31:11] that there's a spirit of suicide on them
[2:31:12] and they're I just pray that God will
[2:31:14] spare them and so if you want to pray
[2:31:16] for something let's pray for our young
[2:31:17] people for it seems like Satan's really
[2:31:19] attacking them right now trying to pull
[2:31:20] them out of this message or trying to
[2:31:22] tell them they're worthless and they
[2:31:23] need to take their own life but we ain't
[2:31:25] going to let the devil have our children
[2:31:27] I said we ain't going to let the devil
[2:31:28] have our children amen so if you got you
[2:31:31] need something to pray about pray for
[2:31:33] that need right there that God will just
[2:31:34] move up on these young people and they
[2:31:35] have a real experience because you see
[2:31:38] if you're just in the message Satan can
[2:31:40] talk you out of it but if the message is
[2:31:42] in you all hell can't get it out of you
[2:31:45] and that's what we want today do you
[2:31:46] love him let's just bow our heads
[2:31:49] heavenly father I I'm just so grateful
[2:31:52] today Lord that we can gather here
[2:31:55] and Lord and set under a Ministry like
[2:31:58] brother Donnie Lord
[2:31:59] and and father I I'm not just bragging
[2:32:02] on brother Donnie but the gift that you
[2:32:05] placed into his life to minister to your
[2:32:06] people we're so thankful for that father
[2:32:09] and Lord I pray that you just strengthen
[2:32:11] our brother Lord and as he said
[2:32:13] sometimes this is the easy part to stand
[2:32:15] here it's the it's the counseling Lord
[2:32:17] and the studying and those aspects of
[2:32:19] the ministry Lord that some people never
[2:32:20] see that that weighs the heaviest but
[2:32:23] Lord I pray that you'd guide him Lord
[2:32:24] that ever interview that ever ever need
[2:32:26] that he would have to witness or speak
[2:32:28] to someone may you just give him the
[2:32:29] words to say Lord and renew his strength
[2:32:31] father we pray and God be with us today
[2:32:34] as we travel Lord and what we have
[2:32:36] planned for this afternoon may you be a
[2:32:37] part of that Lord and father we pray for
[2:32:39] our families and for our children and
[2:32:41] our grandchildren oh that your spirit
[2:32:43] would just move upon each of them dear
[2:32:44] God that they would have their own
[2:32:46] experience and come to the knowledge and
[2:32:47] the grace and the saving power of the
[2:32:49] almighty God and Lord we're just so
[2:32:51] grateful for the things that we've heard
[2:32:53] today and Lord I it's it's not important
[2:32:56] whether we would have the greatest
[2:32:57] Ministry in the world or maybe the least
[2:32:59] Ministry in the world all that matters
[2:33:02] Lord is that we are faithful to the
[2:33:03] ministry that you've given us and Lord
