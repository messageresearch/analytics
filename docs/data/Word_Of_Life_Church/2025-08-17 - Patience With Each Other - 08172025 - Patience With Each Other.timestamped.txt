[4:10] the things of earth.
[4:14] They're going to dim and lose their
[4:17] value.

[4:42] there.

[5:35] with all its toil and struggle
[5:40] [Music]
[5:41] may take its toll
[5:45] of misery
[5:48] and strife.
[5:51] The soul of man
[5:55] is like a waiting falcon
[6:01] when it is released.
[6:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. It's destined for the
[6:08] sky. all your heart and until then

[6:41] until the day
[6:45] God calls

[10:16] requests. We know there's tremendous
[10:17] needs in our group today, but we know
[10:19] that we're serving we're serving a God
[10:21] that's very mindful of whatever your
[10:23] need is. Whether it be in your mind, big
[10:26] or small, he cares about every one of
[10:27] them, doesn't he?

[10:45] My heart can sing
[10:49] when I pause to remember.
[10:56] A heartache here.
[10:59] It's but a stepping stone
[11:06] along the trail.
[11:09] that's winding always upward.
[11:14] I like this. This old troubled world,
[11:19] it's not our final home. Sing it now.
[11:32] Oh, sing with all your heart, church.

[12:47] There was two rings turned into the
[12:50] library. They were found in the lady's
[12:52] restroom. So if those rings belong to
[12:54] you, you can go to the library and pick
[12:56] those up this morning. Brother King,
[12:58] come this morning, buddy. Pray over
[13:00] these prayer requests. We just commit
[13:02] all these things unto the Lord. How many
[13:04] of you love him better than everything
[13:05] in this old world?
[13:07] &gt;&gt; How many of you know he loves you, too?
[13:09] &gt;&gt; Do you feel his love?
[13:10] &gt;&gt; He cares about you. Amen. Give the Lord
[13:12] one more good hand clap of praise. Love
[13:15] you, daddy.
[13:20] Let's just pray. Lord Jesus, thank you
[13:23] for letting us be here today, Father,
[13:25] and just the the privilege to come to
[13:27] church. And I was listening to the
[13:30] sermon from last Sunday and brother T
[13:32] Donnie talking about how they were
[13:34] raising money for churches around the
[13:36] world. And we're just so grateful for
[13:37] the one that we have. And most of all,
[13:40] Lord, that you can be here with us and
[13:42] make it what it is, Lord. That it can be
[13:44] a place where we come and worship you in
[13:46] spirit and in truth, Father. And we just
[13:48] pray that for these needs, Lord, that we
[13:50] bring them to you. And we we know your
[13:51] truth, Lord, that you're a healer,
[13:53] Father. And we know that your spirit's
[13:55] here to move and to deliver every one,
[13:57] Father. Nothing's too great for you. And
[13:59] we know that nothing's too small for you
[14:01] to move on, Lord Jesus. So, we just pray
[14:03] that you move on every heart today,
[14:05] Lord. in the truth comes forth. Be with
[14:07] her pastor, Lord, that he could step to
[14:09] the side and Lord, that your word could
[14:11] come forth and bring life to every
[14:12] heart, Lord Jesus. Lord, if there be one
[14:14] here that doesn't know you, Lord, in
[14:16] that way, that they could just come and
[14:18] that they could know you in such a love,
[14:20] Father, that you would just fulfill
[14:22] their every need, Lord, their every
[14:23] desire, Lord, the hunger of their soul,
[14:25] Lord Jesus, that they would just fall in
[14:27] love with you. Father, we just thank you
[14:29] for the word. We thank you for our
[14:30] brothers and our sisters, Lord, for this
[14:32] atmosphere that you give us. We pray
[14:34] that everyone here would just give their
[14:36] all, Lord, that you would be pleased to
[14:37] dwell with us, Lord. We ask these things
[14:39] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[14:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, buddy. God bless you.
[14:44] Appreciate you. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[14:47] Ushers, if you want to come at this
[14:49] time, receive the morning tithe and
[14:51] offering. Got uh three songs this
[14:53] morning. Uh the Gilberts are going to be
[14:55] singing. Brother Tim Tidwell is here
[14:58] this morning visiting with us. You're
[14:59] going to be hearing from him. And then
[15:01] the choir has a song. So, got a lot to
[15:03] look forward to. Let's sing this song
[15:05] this morning. When the reason that I'm
[15:07] standing stands in front of me today may
[15:10] not be the last Sunday that we'll ever
[15:12] be here, but there'll be a time it'll be
[15:14] the last time we'll be here.
[15:16] &gt;&gt; And we'll stand before the one that gave
[15:19] his all for us. Are you glad for that
[15:21] this morning? Give him one more good
[15:23] hand clap of praise. Amen.
[15:25] [Music]
[15:28] [Applause]
[15:32] I have stood for the gospel
[15:36] when it seemed I stood alone.
[15:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[15:40] &gt;&gt; Through the heartache and frustration,
[15:44] kept my focus on the throne.
[15:48] So many times I have recall.
[15:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; Savior's word so true.
[15:56] If you won't be ashamed.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, if you won't be ashamed,
[16:00] &gt;&gt; I won't be of you. So I proudly
[16:05] stand until I see
[16:08] [Music]
[16:10] the face of the one. Say it to him,
[16:14] church. everything for me
[16:18] along with the reason that I'm standing
[16:24] stands in front of me.
[16:28] Every battle that I've ever fought will
[16:31] fade from memory.
[16:36] I'll bow before his mighty throne and
[16:40] fall down on my knees.
[16:45] when the reason that I'm standing
[16:51] stands in front of me.
[16:57] [Music]
[17:00] The road has not been easy.
[17:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's right.
[17:04] &gt;&gt; Times I've lost my way.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:07] &gt;&gt; So often I've stumbled
[17:11] searching for the light of day.
[17:14] circumstances all around me. I thought
[17:19] I'd surely fall. Yes, sir.
[17:22] &gt;&gt; When the whispering of doubt and fear
[17:25] told me you will lose it all like this.
[17:29] &gt;&gt; But he came
[17:31] with his amazing
[17:34] grace.
[17:36] Oh, and someday soon I'll have the
[17:39] chance to thank you face to face.
[17:44] Oh, when the reason that I'm standing
[17:49] stands in front of me.
[17:53] Every battle that I fought, it'll fade
[17:57] from memory.
[18:02] I'll bow before his mighty throne. and
[18:06] fall down on my knees
[18:11] with a reason that I'm standing
[18:17] stands in front of me.
[18:22] We will join the millions.
[18:25] Every kind tongue and raise
[18:29] your voice. Every child of God that day
[18:33] will look upon you.
[18:38] When the heroes and the martyrs
[18:42] who died on the pagan show
[18:46] stand together,
[18:47] &gt;&gt; we'll all stand together and declare
[18:53] &gt;&gt; Jesus is Lord.
[18:55] &gt;&gt; He's Lord.
[19:00] Oh, when the reasons I'm standing
[19:05] stand in front of me.
[19:09] Every battle that I fought, it'll fade
[19:13] from me. Memory.
[19:18] I'll bow before his mighty throne and
[19:22] fall down on my knees.
[19:27] with the reason that I'm standing
[19:33] stands in front of me.
[19:38] I'll bow before his mighty throne.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, we will. And fall down on my knees.
[19:47] When the reason that I'm standing
[19:53] stands in front of me
[20:00] stands in front of me.
[20:07] Give the Lord a good hand clap this
[20:09] morning. God bless you. Hallelujah. You
[20:12] can have your seat this morning. Give
[20:13] our singers a nice hand as they get
[20:15] ready.
[20:33] [Music]
[20:48] Going through so many
[20:52] changes.
[20:53] [Music]
[20:56] What's the news for
[20:59] today?
[21:03] Somebody's hurt. Somebody's
[21:08] aching.
[21:10] [Music]
[21:11] Somebody's trying to find a way.
[21:19] A heavy heart can break your will.
[21:26] A troubled soul leaves time standing
[21:30] still.
[21:34] If you're hurting, please don't hide.
[21:41] Lift up your head. I'm on your side.
[21:48] When every mountain
[21:52] seems too high,
[21:56] when every river
[21:59] looks too wide,
[22:03] when my dreams are lost and see,
[22:11] Jesus
[22:13] rescues me.
[22:17] My faith is strong and carries me.
[22:24] Though sometimes we
[22:28] still believe.
[22:31] My life is built on his desire.
[22:35] Through the flood and through the fire,
[22:40] Jesus
[22:42] rescues me.
[22:46] I know you're looking for an answer,
[22:53] searching for some hope to hold.
[23:00] Empty hands leave you waiting
[23:07] and praying for a miracle.
[23:14] Jesus hears your every cry.
[23:21] He sees the walls that you can't climb.
[23:26] [Music]
[23:29] And he will heal your hurting
[23:32] soul
[23:35] and lead you safely to his home.
[23:43] Every mountain
[23:46] seems too high
[23:50] and every river
[23:53] looks too wide.
[23:57] When my dreams are lost and sea,
[24:05] Jesus
[24:07] rescues me.
[24:12] The strongest
[24:14] carries me.
[24:18] Sometimes we
[24:21] still believe
[24:25] my life is built on this desire. Through
[24:29] the flood and through the fire,
[24:33] Jesus
[24:36] rescues me.
[24:39] When every mountain
[24:42] seems too high,
[24:46] when every river
[24:49] looks too high,
[24:54] when my dreams are
[24:57] sea,
[25:01] that's when Jesus
[25:04] rescues me.
[25:07] My faith is strong and carries me.
[25:14] Sometimes the weak
[25:18] still.
[25:21] My life is built on this desire. Through
[25:26] the flood and through the fire,
[25:29] Jesus
[25:32] rescues me.
[25:35] My life is built on this desire.
[25:40] Through the flood and through the fire,
[25:44] Jesus
[25:46] rescues me.
[25:50] [Music]
[25:58] Sure
[26:09] been good to come back to my old home.
[26:11] It's been been many many years since
[26:13] I've come the beautiful church. My
[26:15] friends are growing up and getting
[26:16] gayheaded. I'm still still pretty young
[26:18] looking. So, um, you know, I was
[26:22] traveling and listening a little bit of
[26:24] the news and you hear about Russia and
[26:26] you hear about the things going on and
[26:28] and you hear about I've got lots of
[26:29] friends and some people have passed away
[26:31] recently. Over the last three, four
[26:33] weeks or five weeks, we've had three
[26:35] people pass away and the anxiety and the
[26:38] worry and the stress seems to be a
[26:40] day-to-day battle that we're fighting.
[26:43] But there is one man that came so that
[26:46] you don't have to worry. And he stands
[26:48] beside you every moment. If you know
[26:51] this song, sing it with me.
[26:56] Out on the water,
[27:00] storms raging high.
[27:03] The water surrounds them. They were
[27:07] troubled that night
[27:10] as fear filled their hearts.
[27:14] They thought that they would die.
[27:17] They failed to remember
[27:21] that the master was not.
[27:24] And he spoke the words.
[27:28] The winds all stood still.
[27:32] Even the waters
[27:35] obeyed his will
[27:38] and he called their storms
[27:42] just like he will mind if I just
[27:47] remember.
[27:49] He lives deep inside.
[27:52] So why should I worry?
[27:57] Why should I fear?
[27:59] And that very same Jesus
[28:03] stays always dear. And he lives in my
[28:08] heart.
[28:10] And he hears when I cry.
[28:13] I'll call on his name
[28:16] till the storm passes by.
[28:20] [Music]
[28:24] We read in the Bible
[28:27] how he walks within
[28:31] a light to their darkness
[28:34] when the way looks so dear. How great it
[28:39] would be
[28:41] to have his steps leading mine and to
[28:45] walk with the master
[28:48] all of the time.
[28:51] So when trials come
[28:55] and death seems so nice, you just call
[28:59] on his name and he'll get there on time.
[29:05] And when I'm in trouble
[29:08] and my body's in pain,
[29:12] all I have to do is call out his name.
[29:19] So why should we worry?
[29:23] Why should we fear
[29:26] the very same Jesus?
[29:29] He's standing so near. He lives in our
[29:34] hearts
[29:36] and he hears when I cry. I'll follow his
[29:41] name.
[29:43] Till the storm passes by.
[29:47] He read in the Bible,
[29:50] but he walked with them from light to
[29:55] their darkness.
[29:57] And their way looked so dear.
[30:00] How great it would be.
[30:04] Heavy steps leading mine
[30:07] to walk with the master
[30:11] all of the time.
[30:14] know which bios come and the death seems
[30:19] so nice. Just call on his name.
[30:24] He'll get there on time.
[30:28] And if you're in trouble
[30:31] and your body in pain,
[30:35] all you have to do is call his name.
[30:42] Why should I worship you? Sing with me.
[30:45] Why should I
[30:48] in that very same Jesus?
[30:52] He's always so near.
[30:55] He lives in my heart
[30:58] and he hears when I cry.
[31:02] Just call on his name
[31:05] till your storm passes by.
[31:09] Just call on his name
[31:15] till your storm passes by.

[33:04] I'm down in my lowest valley, it doesn't
[33:06] matter. He's always there for me.
[33:28] I know a name
[33:32] that can silence a roaring waves. I know

[41:00] [Music]
[41:04] It's a good thing little David wasn't
[41:06] here. He'd have tore this church up,
[41:07] wasn't he? Oh, yeah.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; God bless. You can be seated. We have a
[41:11] baby to dedicate today.
[41:14] Mine and Carol's niece and nephew from
[41:17] Kentucky had a new addition to their
[41:19] family.
[41:21] So I bring them we dedicate to the Lord
[41:23] today.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Bring them in.
[41:30] Bring them in.
[41:34] Bring them in from the fields of sin.
[41:43] Bring them in.
[41:47] Bring them in.
[41:52] Bring the little ones to Jesus.
[41:58] [Music]
[42:03] Let's just bow our heads together.
[42:06] Heavenly fathers, my brother and sister
[42:09] and their children stand before you. We
[42:13] realize what a great heritage the
[42:15] children are.
[42:17] What a gift from God and you have what a
[42:20] responsibility from God as well.
[42:23] Dear Lord, I pray that you would just
[42:25] help Joe and Hope today that as they
[42:29] bring their little children up to you
[42:31] and try to rear them and teach them and
[42:35] the admonition of God. What a challenge
[42:38] it is for parents truly in this hour to
[42:42] want to instruct their children in the
[42:44] ways that please you. Every day we live,
[42:46] our nation, our world is getting darker
[42:49] and darker. But in reality, that's what
[42:52] makes our light shine so bright. Father,
[42:56] I pray that you'd just be with them,
[42:58] Lord. Dear God, this new little addition
[43:01] to their family, no doubt with his own
[43:03] unique personality and own makeup.
[43:06] We just pray, Father, that you'd help
[43:08] each of them to help each other. We know
[43:11] that a God-given family is a great gift
[43:14] to you. As a matter of fact, the first
[43:16] thing in heaven was not skyscrapers
[43:20] and banks and loan institutions. But
[43:23] father when you placed the garden and
[43:25] then you brought a man and placed him
[43:27] there and then out of that man you
[43:30] brought a wife. Your intention was to
[43:32] bring forth children by the spoken word
[43:35] from that union. But Lord, even though
[43:38] they forfeited that right, you've still
[43:40] made a way and we're grateful that you
[43:42] have. We dedicate this little life to
[43:45] you today, Father, for a life of
[43:47] service. Take him, I pray, Lord. take
[43:50] this little family, keep him in your
[43:52] grace, in your mercy, Father, in the
[43:55] name of Jesus we pray. Amen.
[44:01] Put him right to sleep.
[44:05] Bless you.
[44:07] [Applause]
[44:13] Can we stand together?
[44:17] What a privilege it is for us to be in
[44:18] the house of God today, isn't it?
[44:21] &gt;&gt; What a great honor the Lord has given us
[44:23] that we can be able to come together.
[44:27] Second Peter chapter 1 verse 2. I want
[44:29] to speak to you today on patience
[44:33] with each other.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; All right.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm sure this is probably not for
[44:38] anyone here but Carol and I. And we so
[44:42] appreciate y'all being patient while the
[44:45] Lord takes this entire sermon and deals
[44:48] with Carol and myself.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah, right.
[44:58] Second Peter 1:2. Grace and peace be
[45:01] multiplied unto you through the
[45:03] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
[45:06] according as his divine power hath given
[45:09] us unto us all things that pertain unto
[45:13] life and godliness through the knowledge
[45:16] of him that has called us to glory and
[45:19] virtue whereby are given unto us
[45:22] exceeding great and precious promises
[45:26] that by these you might be partakers of
[45:29] the divine nature. What greater honor
[45:32] could we have than to be partakers of
[45:34] the divine nature? Having escaped the
[45:37] corruption that is in the world through
[45:40] lust. And beside this, giving all
[45:43] diligence, add to your faith virtue, and
[45:46] to virtue knowledge. And to knowledge,
[45:48] temperance, and to temperance, patience,
[45:52] and to patience, godliness, and to
[45:55] godliness, brotherly kindness, and to
[45:58] brotherly kindness, charity. Now, before
[46:02] I speak today, I just want to reiterate
[46:03] it to you again. This sermon today is
[46:06] not for everyone. As a matter of fact,
[46:08] it's only for a very very small handful
[46:11] of people around the world. There'll be
[46:14] an element of people that will hear it,
[46:16] desire to have it, but really will never
[46:18] attain to it because it's not for
[46:20] everybody. It's only for those who are
[46:23] ordained to be in the body of God and
[46:27] have the image of God. Other people can
[46:29] be Christians and they will be saved.
[46:32] But this message is more than just for
[46:35] saved people.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Is it for you?
[46:39] &gt;&gt; It's for me. I'm one of them who may
[46:41] like to be remembered today as we pray
[46:43] and ask God's blessings on the word.
[46:46] Heavenly Father, I don't say those
[46:48] things lightly.
[46:51] And I realize, Lord Jesus, that if we
[46:53] have the desire to be conformed into
[46:55] this image, we're a very blessed people.
[46:58] For many people will be satisfied just
[47:00] in going to church.
[47:03] They can treat God's people awful. They
[47:05] can call them names. They can run them
[47:07] down. They'll live ungodly, dress
[47:09] ungodly, just do horrible, terrible
[47:12] things. And they won't realize until the
[47:15] bomb drops or they're caught in the
[47:18] tsunami or they're trying to survive
[47:22] after the earthquake hits. And then they
[47:26] begin to realize they've played church
[47:30] and they've missed opportunity after
[47:32] opportunity to align with your word
[47:36] already. Father, we can see by the signs
[47:38] of the time when you anointed your
[47:40] prophet to speak it in 1965
[47:44] that that city of Los Angeles, it would
[47:46] be worse than it was in the days of last
[47:49] days of Pompei.
[47:52] At that time, scientists were saying
[47:54] that there would be a big one, but they
[47:57] were saying that it was impossible for
[48:00] part of the earth to break away and fall
[48:03] down into the ocean. But as we go on in
[48:07] time, they are saying scientifically
[48:11] more and more of what your prophet said
[48:13] decades and decades ago. And now the
[48:16] ring of fire is more active than it's
[48:19] ever been. And Lord, we saw heard the
[48:22] news of the one up in Russia. And from
[48:24] there it turned out great volcanic
[48:26] explosions, some that have been silent
[48:28] for hundreds of years. And the
[48:30] scientists are getting more terrified.
[48:34] But Lord Jesus, for those of us who are
[48:36] ready, we are not afraid. We are with
[48:39] great anticipation, longing for your
[48:42] coming. Help us today, Father, as we
[48:44] look into your word. May our lives be
[48:46] shaped into this image. In the name of
[48:49] the Lord Jesus we pray. And the saints
[48:51] said,
[48:52] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[48:56] Let's tap back for just a few moments if
[48:59] you don't mind.
[49:01] Patience first of all must be toward God
[49:06] and his promise.
[49:08] Peter when he writes this, no doubt it
[49:12] was quite a a great thing for him in his
[49:15] life when the spirit of God had revealed
[49:18] this to him. Not necessarily in the same
[49:21] way that some of the words come to Paul
[49:24] because Paul was a prophet and a church
[49:26] age messenger, but by inspiration, Peter
[49:29] Peter caught this element to be able to
[49:32] bring it to the people of God. And it
[49:34] was different than anything Peter had
[49:37] ever written. He wrote about the lamb.
[49:40] He wrote about experiences that he had.
[49:42] And he wrote about different things that
[49:44] God gave him about the conditions of the
[49:46] church and so on. But yet for him to be
[49:48] able to catch this was a pretty
[49:50] phenomenal thing of the image of the
[49:54] building blocks of God to be able to
[49:56] build God a body. For we know when the
[50:00] Lord Jesus came that he quoted back to
[50:02] the word and said, "Lo, it is written of
[50:05] me, a body hast thou prepared me." And
[50:08] again, lo, I come in the volume of the
[50:12] book. So the prophecies of the Old
[50:15] Testament were the building blocks not
[50:17] only of Jesus natural anatomy, of
[50:19] course, the natural body, but of the
[50:21] spiritual making. And God was making a
[50:24] bridegroom. So he made a bridegroom out
[50:27] of prophetic words. So what do you
[50:29] figure the bride will be? If the
[50:31] bridegroom was prophetic words, then in
[50:34] order to have a bride which will be of
[50:35] the same character, she must also be
[50:38] prophetic words. And then whenever Peter
[50:40] was able to catch this, I imagine that
[50:43] some of the brethren as they read this,
[50:45] they thought this is absolutely
[50:47] astounding. And remember, Simon Peter
[50:49] was an ignorant and an unlearned man.
[50:53] And yet the words that God gave him to
[50:55] use, this word patience, we've looked at
[50:58] it before. Steadfastness, characteristic
[51:00] of a man who is not swerved from his
[51:03] deliberate purpose and his loyalty to
[51:06] faith and piety by even the greatest
[51:09] trials and sufferings patiently and
[51:11] steadfastly. Now remember, this is not
[51:14] something that Peter had naturally. We
[51:17] don't see what his story was. He wound
[51:19] up being a cursing preacher. So this
[51:22] certainly didn't define him. It didn't
[51:24] define him by his first birth. But no
[51:26] doubt by now he had already in seed form
[51:30] and it kept unfolding a little more and
[51:32] a little more and a little more to where
[51:34] he himself had already been experiencing
[51:37] these seven virtues and then the eights
[51:39] he was waiting on to cap him.
[51:42] Ecclesiastes 7:8 says, "Better is the
[51:45] end of a thing than the beginning
[51:47] thereof, and the patient in spirit is
[51:51] better than the proud in spirit."
[51:54] Anybody say amen to that promise?
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 2:6, who will render to
[52:00] every man according to his deeds, to
[52:03] them by patient continuence. Now even
[52:07] though this is a different English word,
[52:09] it's the exact same Greek word that Paul
[52:13] used or Peter used rather when he wrote
[52:16] about the virtues here. It's exact same
[52:18] word. So it means steadfastness,
[52:20] constancy, endurance. So here Paul takes
[52:24] the same thought now and writes and says
[52:27] to them who by patient continuence in
[52:31] welloing seek for glory and honor and
[52:35] immortality
[52:37] eternal life. Romans 12:12
[52:41] rejoicing in hope patient in
[52:44] tribulation. Same Greek word but a
[52:47] little different meaning to this word.
[52:50] Endure, take patiently to preserve under
[52:54] misfortunes and trials, to hold fast
[52:57] one's faith in Christ, rejoicing in
[53:01] hope, patient in tribulation. Now listen
[53:05] what tribulation is. Affliction,
[53:08] trouble, anguish, burdened to be
[53:12] afflicted, oppressing together,
[53:15] oppression, affliction, tribulation,
[53:20] distress,
[53:21] straits.
[53:23] Sounded like my week this week.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Sounded like any of your week or your
[53:28] day? Now notice this is what an element
[53:32] of people are going to tame to rejoicing
[53:35] and hope. patient in tribulation,
[53:38] continuing instant in prayer,
[53:43] instant in prayer. Now, we all have
[53:46] instant potatoes, instant coffee,
[53:48] instant this, instant that. But there
[53:51] are times in our life when we need to be
[53:55] instant in prayer. The wherefors and the
[53:59] thous and the this and that and the
[54:00] other. You ever get in a real, you know,
[54:03] in a real pickle in your life? and the
[54:05] wherefors and the thous and the thou
[54:07] hast not and thou hast and all that. You
[54:09] just lay aside all that religious
[54:11] vernacular and say, "Dear God, I need
[54:13] help."
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; That's right. Why? Cuz then you're
[54:18] calling out from your heart instead of
[54:20] trying to impress him or impress
[54:22] somebody else that's hearing you with
[54:23] the these and the thouss.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; You know what? He knows what your heart
[54:27] is anyway. rejoicing in hope, patient in
[54:30] tribulation, continuing instant in
[54:34] prayer. 2 Thessalonians chapter 3:5. And
[54:38] the Lord direct your hearts. I love the
[54:41] way Paul wrote this. Direct your hearts
[54:44] into
[54:46] the love of God. And I don't think this
[54:48] comes automatically just because you
[54:50] become a Christian. But God must give us
[54:53] divine direction for our heart to be
[54:56] directed into the love of God. Now a
[55:00] person can be directed into what they
[55:02] think is the love of God. But only God
[55:06] can direct us into his love because he's
[55:09] the author of that love. And the Lord
[55:12] direct, guide, make straight of the
[55:16] removal of the hindrances to come to
[55:19] one. Now, this is why we come to church
[55:22] that the spirit of God can be able to
[55:24] take I know preaching is foolishness. I
[55:26] know it every time I do it. That's what
[55:28] the Bible calls it through the
[55:30] foolishness of preaching. But God can
[55:33] take the foolishness of preaching and be
[55:36] able to take a gift in a man's life and
[55:39] be able to say things that you talked
[55:41] about coming to church or say things
[55:44] that you said yesterday or the day
[55:46] before and give you a direction. It may
[55:49] not be but three or four words and
[55:51] you'll sat there the entire service and
[55:53] you got the first three or four words
[55:55] and the rest of it you just worship with
[55:57] everybody else. But you knew God gave
[56:00] you a rama word from him.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Now it's awesome whenever we will get
[56:05] the logos which is what I'm sharing with
[56:07] you right now. The logos which is the
[56:09] thought or the concept of God for the
[56:11] age. But God is so awesome that he will
[56:15] not only give us written logos, but he
[56:18] will use his anointed men which are
[56:20] gifted from the foundation of the world
[56:23] and send you in particular a Rama word.
[56:27] Now that Rama word isn't always one that
[56:30] is written, but remember Rama is that
[56:33] which Paul wrote about that the just
[56:36] shall live by faith and that faith
[56:38] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[56:41] word. That's not logos. That is Rama.
[56:44] What is Rama? It is a word that is
[56:47] fitted in season for you in the time
[56:51] that you need it. I believe when we come
[56:53] to the house of God, that's what we
[56:55] ought to come for. So watch Paul as he
[56:57] writes that the Lord direct your hearts
[57:00] into the love of God, which is agape, of
[57:03] course, and into the patient waiting for
[57:07] Christ. Now, the prophet says all
[57:09] different types of things about patient
[57:11] and patience and impatient and all that.
[57:14] I love this one in shalom when he says,
[57:17] "Some people says, "But brother
[57:18] Brandham, I've tried and I've tried, but
[57:22] wait a minute. Patience is virtue."
[57:25] Patience is Holy Spirit virtue. They
[57:28] that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[57:31] their strength. You say, "How can I wait
[57:34] any longer?" Listen to this deep answer.
[57:37] Just keep on waiting. How can I wait any
[57:42] longer? Just keep on waiting. When
[57:45] you've done all you can do to stand,
[57:48] then stand. Just stand. How am I going
[57:52] to do it? Stand. He said, "It's the
[57:55] truth." And it's the truth. He said
[57:57] it'll happen. How? I don't know, but
[58:00] it'll happen. He said so. He promised
[58:03] it. If he promised it, it's going to
[58:06] happen. That's all. And the church said,
[58:09] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Events made clear by prophecy. I love
[58:12] this one as well. In this, the true
[58:14] believers in the word who accept it in
[58:18] that way believe it and with patience
[58:21] wait for its prophesied
[58:24] promises in every one of them to be
[58:28] manifested in its age. waiting for the
[58:31] prophesied
[58:33] promises to be manifested in its age.
[58:36] Every believer has watched for it. Every
[58:39] believer that's been on their toes
[58:42] watching is the one that it's been
[58:45] revealed to. Now truly God unfolds that
[58:48] trust that we must have in him. And you
[58:51] know God knows exactly the divine order
[58:54] which we able need to be able to receive
[58:56] it. And truly, we'll never be able to
[58:57] have the right patience with one another
[59:00] if we don't have the right element and
[59:03] measure of patience with God. Now,
[59:05] dealing with God and dealing with our
[59:08] brothers and sisters, of course, is a
[59:11] total different thing in one way, but in
[59:14] another way, we are also measured by how
[59:18] we attribute our love to God by the way
[59:21] we treat one another. Now when you or I
[59:25] are mean to God's people or we will
[59:28] treat God's people bad, we don't look at
[59:32] it this way. But actually when you are
[59:34] mean toward a saint of God or you tell
[59:38] lies or you fabricate things against the
[59:41] children of God, you might as well have
[59:44] done it against the Lord Jesus. That's
[59:46] true. Now you see in our minds we think
[59:50] well I I treat him with so much devotion
[59:53] and so much love and I love him so much
[59:56] but I don't like his people. I don't
[59:59] like I don't like I don't like and
[1:00:01] somehow we separate that in our mind and
[1:00:04] think that's fine with God but I'd like
[1:00:07] for you to show me where that's at in
[1:00:09] the word
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; and I'd like for you to show me that in
[1:00:13] the message of the hour. As a matter of
[1:00:15] fact, God and his people in that sense
[1:00:18] are inseparable. Many people will be
[1:00:21] lost not because they didn't believe on
[1:00:24] the cross, but because they treated
[1:00:27] God's people in the age they lived bad.
[1:00:30] Jesus said, "When you've done it to the
[1:00:33] least of these, my brothers, you have
[1:00:36] done it unto me."
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; So, if I was you, I'd be nice to
[1:00:40] everybody.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Of course, I realize everybody ain't got
[1:00:43] that much kindness. They just got a
[1:00:44] little bit of it and they got already
[1:00:46] spread it out. I really feel sorry for
[1:00:48] those types of Christians, but we know
[1:00:49] there's all kinds of them. Now, notice
[1:00:51] that Jesus himself as God, he would have
[1:00:55] had this attribute of pre of patience in
[1:00:59] such a measure that you and I will never
[1:01:01] be able to attain to as an individual.
[1:01:03] But in the act of condescension when he
[1:01:06] come to the earth, now it wasn't that he
[1:01:09] wasn't royal and divine and holy. He was
[1:01:12] all of that. But what he did was he
[1:01:15] emptied himself of the measure of all of
[1:01:18] these things that he had as God and
[1:01:22] condescended into a form of a diluted or
[1:01:27] washed down measure of these things that
[1:01:30] we're talking about. So the Lord Jesus
[1:01:33] would have experienced patience with the
[1:01:36] people around him and with his disciples
[1:01:39] mainly in a more human measure than he
[1:01:42] would have in a divine measure. Now he
[1:01:45] would have dealt with love. He would
[1:01:47] have dealt with forgiveness. We know
[1:01:49] that he dealt with temptation in a human
[1:01:52] level and not in a divine level. Let me
[1:01:54] say this so you understand it. If Jesus
[1:01:56] overcomes sexual temptation as God, he
[1:02:00] can never understand what any of us go
[1:02:03] through as humans.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; If he overcome whatever it would be, the
[1:02:08] prophet said he was tempted by lying. He
[1:02:10] was tempted by drinking. He was tempted
[1:02:12] by women. And Paul said he was tempted
[1:02:14] in all points like as we are. 1949, the
[1:02:17] prophet tells us that Jesus suffered
[1:02:19] sexual temptation. But God cannot be
[1:02:22] tempted. So if Jesus was tempted as God,
[1:02:27] he never even felt it. It never bothered
[1:02:30] him. It never even come into his mind to
[1:02:33] even to start in the process of
[1:02:35] conception of sin. So when I go to him
[1:02:37] as a high priest, I'm basically wasting
[1:02:39] my time unless he suffered it as a man.
[1:02:44] You believe he did? So then whenever we
[1:02:46] look at that, he condescended from his
[1:02:49] great person of what he was. So he
[1:02:51] stepped down from the sheckiah which is
[1:02:53] what we would call in the English the
[1:02:55] shakina glory of God and he stepped down
[1:02:57] into a human form that as a little boy
[1:03:01] no doubt that Jesus learning to walk and
[1:03:03] he fell like every other little Jewish
[1:03:05] boy and his mama would have to come and
[1:03:07] pick him up and you know kiss his
[1:03:09] bruises and maybe Jesus would fall and
[1:03:12] bite his lip as he would fall and his
[1:03:14] mama would would get something on a
[1:03:16] cross and wet that and wipe the blood
[1:03:18] off of it and yet her soul wasn't
[1:03:20] redeemed whenever that blood would come
[1:03:23] off of Jesus' lips onto her hands. So
[1:03:26] Jesus would cry when he was hungry and
[1:03:28] Jesus would fall down and when Jesus
[1:03:30] first started learning how to walk, he
[1:03:32] would be like any 18-month-old boy or
[1:03:35] 2-year-old, he would fall and maybe bust
[1:03:37] his nose or whatever he would do. So it
[1:03:40] condescended to that level. Now whenever
[1:03:43] he receives the Holy Ghost, if he
[1:03:45] received the Holy Ghost in a way that is
[1:03:49] different from us, now remember that he
[1:03:51] was the predestinated seed word that God
[1:03:54] spoke. But he lived for 30 years in this
[1:03:57] life without the Holy Ghost. Without the
[1:04:01] Holy Ghost. Come on, somebody. I
[1:04:03] preached it to you enough. You should
[1:04:04] already know it. He lived 30 years in
[1:04:06] this life as a man without the Holy
[1:04:09] Ghost. So what does he receive? Now, one
[1:04:11] great difference of course was that he
[1:04:13] did not receive a portion. He received
[1:04:16] the fullness of the godhead. You and I
[1:04:18] receive a portion. But if our portion is
[1:04:22] not equivalent to give us the power to
[1:04:25] overcome, he's still unjust by demanding
[1:04:29] of me that I walk like him whenever he
[1:04:32] got all this great massive volume and I
[1:04:35] only got a little symbol full. So you
[1:04:38] see, he knows that even a symbol full
[1:04:41] can help me overcome just like all the
[1:04:44] heavens full can.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; So watch now. The Lord Jesus allowed
[1:04:49] himself to be in this realm of humanity
[1:04:53] and feel weary and no doubt people
[1:04:56] exhausted him. The people would be
[1:05:00] pulling on him and constantly wanting
[1:05:02] healing and deliverance and and this and
[1:05:04] that. And and no doubt Jesus as a man,
[1:05:07] he would look upon the people and feel
[1:05:09] so sorry for them as a human being. But
[1:05:11] he couldn't go in there and just at will
[1:05:13] heal everybody where he went to where
[1:05:15] they were sick. But we know that the man
[1:05:18] that was actually uh crippled and had
[1:05:20] been laying there for 38 years at the
[1:05:22] pool. And the Lord Jesus passed through
[1:05:24] the multitude. So there was crippled
[1:05:26] babies and little girls and little boys
[1:05:28] and blind children, blind mammas and
[1:05:30] daddies, all kinds of people, a
[1:05:32] multitude of people that were there. And
[1:05:34] the Lord Jesus meandered and worked his
[1:05:36] way around and worked his way around
[1:05:38] until he went to a man that had prostate
[1:05:40] trouble. Now, it wasn't going to kill
[1:05:42] him. He'd been laying there for many,
[1:05:44] many years. And it was evident that he
[1:05:46] had been, you know, in that sense, he
[1:05:48] was unlike many of the others that were
[1:05:49] there. Why did Jesus go to that one and
[1:05:52] pass all the rest of those? Cuz the
[1:05:54] father had showed him a vision. So what
[1:05:56] did he do? He submitted himself to the
[1:05:59] leadership of the spirit of God. So with
[1:06:02] him was all the power of God in him
[1:06:05] could not do as he so desired or as he
[1:06:08] willed it. Nevertheless, not my will but
[1:06:10] thy will be done. What makes us think we
[1:06:13] can?
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Jesus was an example of obedience. Luke
[1:06:19] 2:52.
[1:06:22] And he went back home and submitted
[1:06:24] himself unto Joseph and Mary, of course,
[1:06:27] and grew in knowledge and in wisdom
[1:06:29] before God and man. You imagine the
[1:06:33] word, the logos. And the logos submitted
[1:06:36] himself to growing. Why didn't Jesus
[1:06:38] start preaching when he was a 12y old
[1:06:40] boy? I mentioned it to you the other
[1:06:42] day. Little David Walker, which is still
[1:06:44] alive. And he was a little assembly of
[1:06:46] God guy. And brother Bam actually said
[1:06:48] he was called to preach. And he started
[1:06:49] preaching about 9 or 10 years old,
[1:06:51] something like that. Had meetings
[1:06:52] everywhere. People come to the altar and
[1:06:54] get saved. Brother Bam said if the
[1:06:56] Pentecostal people would have rallied
[1:06:58] around that little boy's gift, it would
[1:07:00] have been phenomenal what God would have
[1:07:01] done. But he said because this one come
[1:07:04] out of a certain denomination, then the
[1:07:06] other people had to have one, too. So
[1:07:07] they had a little David and a little Bob
[1:07:09] and a little Jim and a little George and
[1:07:11] a little this and that and the other.
[1:07:12] And the little old boy just quit
[1:07:13] preaching. He's still alive today. Now
[1:07:16] you think why? Jealousy, jealousy. But
[1:07:19] yet Jesus allowed himself to feel like
[1:07:23] you and I would feel. Turn with me if
[1:07:24] you would to Mark 10:35.
[1:07:27] So Jesus had to have patience with the
[1:07:30] Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Essenes,
[1:07:33] but he had to have a different patience
[1:07:36] from the same virtue of course, but
[1:07:37] manifested in a way to his disciples
[1:07:41] would in one way been more trying. Now
[1:07:44] watch in James 10:35. And James and John
[1:07:47] the sons of Zebedee came unto him,
[1:07:49] saying, Master, we would that thou
[1:07:51] should us do for us whatsoever we shall
[1:07:56] desire. Now, I want you to notice how
[1:07:58] childish
[1:08:00] they approach this.
[1:08:02] They're wanting him to agree to it
[1:08:06] before they even mention what they want.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; They should have known him better than
[1:08:10] that by now. Notice how they word it.
[1:08:14] Saying, "Master, we would that thou
[1:08:15] should us do for us whatsoever,
[1:08:19] whatsoever
[1:08:21] we shall desire," even before they
[1:08:23] stated it. Now, now watch Jesus. And he
[1:08:26] said unto them, "What would ye like you
[1:08:29] didn't know that I should do for you?"
[1:08:32] And they said unto him, Grant us that we
[1:08:35] may sit one on thy right hand and one on
[1:08:40] thy left hand in thy glory. Now that is
[1:08:45] a sign to us the highest position in the
[1:08:50] kingdom that is to come. Cuz they kept
[1:08:52] hearing him talk about a kingdom and a
[1:08:53] throne and all that. And they thought,
[1:08:55] you know what? He's told us whatever you
[1:08:57] ask in my name, I'll do it. and you've
[1:09:01] not asked anything in my name, so ask
[1:09:03] and I'll give it to you. Ask and you
[1:09:05] shall receive. Knock and it shall be
[1:09:08] opened unto you. Whatever things you
[1:09:10] desire when you pray, believe that you
[1:09:12] receive them and you shall have them.
[1:09:14] But every one of those promises have to
[1:09:16] be applied in the right way or you make
[1:09:18] the word of God, not the will of God. So
[1:09:22] they could have went to him with
[1:09:23] promises, but of course they knew he
[1:09:25] knew the word and they didn't feel like
[1:09:27] the word was actually important to quote
[1:09:29] him. So now the prevalent thing was
[1:09:31] their own desire. So apparently they had
[1:09:35] not learned yet that the cross must come
[1:09:40] before the crown.
[1:09:42] They had not yet learned that suffering
[1:09:46] comes before glorification.
[1:09:49] They had not yet learned that character
[1:09:52] must preede the right to reign.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; So they just thought it was just that
[1:09:57] simple. Just ask for. Now remember these
[1:10:00] two brothers were among the elite of the
[1:10:04] disciples. They were some of the best.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; But even the best of God's people can
[1:10:13] have problems with pride
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; and arrogance
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; and wanting to be above their brothers
[1:10:21] and their sisters.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Now notice Jesus response. Mark 10:38.
[1:10:28] And Jesus said unto them,
[1:10:32] "You know not what you ask."
[1:10:38] Can you drink of the cup
[1:10:41] I drink of?
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Boys, be careful.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Be careful what you're going to say.
[1:10:49] Watch them answer in their pride. I
[1:10:53] myself as a Bible reader,
[1:10:56] I wonder by answering this question in
[1:10:59] pride how much more they added to their
[1:11:03] own life.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Because of their arrogance,
[1:11:09] I'm talking about elect.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; But remember, they were elect without
[1:11:15] the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:18] Can you drink of the cup I drink of
[1:11:22] and be baptized with the baptism baptism
[1:11:26] that I'm baptized with? Now remember
[1:11:27] Jesus is likening the cup from the Old
[1:11:30] Testament silitude how that a cup was
[1:11:34] the prophet talked about it that he saw
[1:11:36] a cup with bitter drags in the bottom of
[1:11:39] the cup. So it would be a lot of life, a
[1:11:43] position in life, or it could be
[1:11:46] judgment that's meed out to you. So
[1:11:48] Jesus is asking them, "All right, boys,
[1:11:50] this is what you want. Now, let me ask
[1:11:52] you a question. Can you drink of the cup
[1:11:55] that I drink of?" And before he he lets
[1:11:57] them answer, he goes on and say, "Can
[1:11:59] you be baptized with the baptism that
[1:12:02] I'm to be baptized with?" Now he's not
[1:12:03] talking about water baptism, but he's
[1:12:06] talking about again the type of anguish
[1:12:08] and sorrow and the difficulty in life. I
[1:12:12] wonder how many things friends we have
[1:12:14] added to our self
[1:12:17] because of our pride.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Now notice their response.
[1:12:25] And they said unto him,
[1:12:27] "We can."
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; How in their right mind
[1:12:35] could they after hearing all the words
[1:12:38] that he had said,
[1:12:41] "Yes, whatever you bear, we can bear it
[1:12:44] right with you. Cuz we are so tough,
[1:12:49] man. We are the best ones you've got.
[1:12:51] And if anybody can handle it, we can. It
[1:12:54] ain't no wonder God hates that thing.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; You know where our spirit comes from?
[1:13:00] Hell.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; God hates arrogance
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; and pride.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; And they said unto him, we can.
[1:13:11] And Jesus said unto them, "Ye shall
[1:13:16] indeed."
[1:13:19] I wonder how much easier John's life.
[1:13:22] John,
[1:13:24] John, the beloved John.
[1:13:29] How much easier.
[1:13:32] But because of his pride and his
[1:13:35] arrogance,
[1:13:37] his destiny was multiplied from this day
[1:13:41] on. Not so much the glory, but the cup,
[1:13:45] the bitterness, the dregs that was added
[1:13:49] to James and John's life. And Jesus said
[1:13:52] unto them, "You shall indeed drink of
[1:13:54] the cup that I drink of."
[1:13:57] You boys are certainly going to have it.
[1:14:01] And with the baptism that I'm baptized
[1:14:04] with, with all shall you be baptized.
[1:14:06] But
[1:14:08] you will get more trouble. You will get
[1:14:10] more anguish. You will deal with more
[1:14:13] stuff than you ever thought possible in
[1:14:15] your life. But you will not get the
[1:14:18] thrones you wanted.
[1:14:22] Lord have mercy. Children, think
[1:14:25] whenever we're asking God for selfish
[1:14:28] things and motives to feed our pride and
[1:14:31] our arrogance that God indeed may grant
[1:14:34] to us more trouble, more heartache, more
[1:14:38] suffering, more difficulty, and still
[1:14:41] not give you the main thing you asked
[1:14:43] for. They didn't ask for that.
[1:14:46] They didn't want more heartache. They
[1:14:48] didn't want more anxiety, brother Scott.
[1:14:50] But Jesus said, "You will have it.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; But in your arrogance, you wanted for
[1:14:56] the right hand throne and the left hand
[1:14:58] thrown." Well, I hate to tell you, boys,
[1:15:00] that ain't mine to give.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; But because of your pride and arrogance,
[1:15:06] you just ask for a whole lot more in
[1:15:08] life.
[1:15:11] Dear God, help us all.
[1:15:14] Anybody say, "Help me, Lord."
[1:15:17] Oh my. But to sit on my right hand and
[1:15:21] on my left hand is not mine to give. Can
[1:15:23] you imagine now?
[1:15:26] Here by chapter 10 in the book of Mark,
[1:15:28] Jesus is getting closer and closer to
[1:15:31] heading up to Jerusalem and be
[1:15:32] crucified. And here he's facing these
[1:15:35] horrific things. And all they've got in
[1:15:38] their mind is their position. What am I
[1:15:42] going to get out of this? If he's
[1:15:44] leaving, what am I going to become? You
[1:15:47] imagine them getting together and
[1:15:48] talking about way think about it, James.
[1:15:49] You reckon we should ask him? I think we
[1:15:51] should. I mean, who knows? He may give
[1:15:53] it to Peter. Lord have mercy. What in
[1:15:55] the world will the church be if Peter
[1:15:57] gets it? What will it be if if Jude gets
[1:15:59] it? What will it be if this one gets it?
[1:16:00] I'll tell you one thing. Don't you
[1:16:02] agree, brother, that we're some of the
[1:16:03] greatest preachers of the message? I do,
[1:16:05] brother. Amen. Glory to God. Ain't
[1:16:07] nobody got love for Jesus like we do.
[1:16:09] Look at you. You're constantly laying on
[1:16:11] his breast over there. And James, I
[1:16:13] mean, you're one of the great ones.
[1:16:14] Ain't we always in the inner circle of
[1:16:16] things going on? We are. Well, don't you
[1:16:18] think maybe that's a type that we're
[1:16:20] supposed to be some of the greatest
[1:16:22] preachers in the message and that a lot
[1:16:24] of the people around the message are
[1:16:25] going to start moving to our church and
[1:16:27] we're going to be a great gigantic mega
[1:16:30] church?
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:16:36] Oh, I just changed their speech to what
[1:16:39] some of the modern message preachers
[1:16:41] want.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; I don't want a mega church.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; I want a church full of the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; People who love God
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; and love one another.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's 15 or500 or
[1:16:55] whatever it is. I want what God wants
[1:16:57] for me.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; I'm not asking for the throne on the
[1:17:01] left or the right. As a matter of fact,
[1:17:03] I ain't even asking for one
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; cuz I'm afraid I might get in the flesh
[1:17:07] somehow and instead of getting a throne,
[1:17:09] I get a whooping.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; I ain't like some of you.
[1:17:14] God lets some of you get by with lying.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Some of you can treat God's children
[1:17:19] like dogs
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; and God let you get by with it.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Makes me wonder if you're a son or
[1:17:25] daughter.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; God won't let me do that. You say,
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; and to be honest with you, I'm glad I
[1:17:32] got marks all over me.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; God whoops me. Whoop any the rest of
[1:17:38] y'all or you just let you get by with
[1:17:39] all your stuff.
[1:17:42] Now watch how the Lord Jesus
[1:17:46] had to have patience
[1:17:49] and he said to sit on my right hand and
[1:17:51] on my left hand is not mine to give but
[1:17:53] it shall be given to them.
[1:17:56] Oh my. For whom
[1:17:59] it is prepared.
[1:18:02] So Jesus didn't say there wouldn't be
[1:18:06] two great men
[1:18:09] that wouldn't get it.
[1:18:14] Great men.
[1:18:17] Maybe first church age messenger and
[1:18:19] seventh one. Who knows? Notice in verse
[1:18:22] 41 now. And when the 10 heard him,
[1:18:28] they began to be much displeased.
[1:18:32] You can imagine.
[1:18:36] So they do it. I mean, what's the matter
[1:18:38] with James and John? My goodness. In
[1:18:40] front of all the rest of the brothers.
[1:18:41] And they're all as jealous as they can
[1:18:43] be of one another. And they asked right
[1:18:45] in front of them. And boy, whenever the
[1:18:47] other 10 heard about it, then Mark says
[1:18:49] that they began to be much displeased.
[1:18:51] Look at this word. Have indignation
[1:18:55] to be indignant.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; So they didn't just get their feathers
[1:19:02] ruffled a little bit. They was in the
[1:19:04] flogging mood.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; They were indignant
[1:19:11] preachers.
[1:19:13] The first apostles of the Lord Jesus.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; But you know what? This shows me this
[1:19:19] jealous reaction shows me they also
[1:19:26] wanted the same thing
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; and they were terrified because they
[1:19:31] they thought they had been
[1:19:33] outmaneuvered.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; So instead of feeling sorry for their
[1:19:38] brothers, they were so mad.
[1:19:42] And you imagine Jesus with his patience.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Boy, he could have preached these guys a
[1:19:49] sermon, couldn't he? Sit down, boys.
[1:19:51] It's time for the preacher to preach to
[1:19:53] the preachers.
[1:19:56] He's fixing to. Verse 42. But Jesus
[1:19:59] called to them and sith unto them, you
[1:20:02] know that they which are accounted to
[1:20:03] rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship
[1:20:08] over them, and their great ones exercise
[1:20:13] authority upon them,
[1:20:17] but so shall it not be among you. But
[1:20:21] whosoever will be great among you shall
[1:20:24] be your minister.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:20:29] So you mean great and minister is not
[1:20:32] synonymous.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; But how come we think it is?
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Actually church, you're not called to
[1:20:41] serve me.
[1:20:43] I'm called to serve you.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Every God called preacher is called to
[1:20:50] serve the people of God.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; You're not to make heroes out of them.
[1:20:55] You're not to make idols out of them.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, you all could vote
[1:21:02] me out after this sermon today.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; But I can't vote you out.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; God sure knew what he was doing.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Isn't that something? Now we're, as I
[1:21:19] dealt with it Wednesday night, we'll
[1:21:20] pick it up again for a little bit more,
[1:21:21] maybe this coming Wednesday night. We're
[1:21:23] supposed to be a cult
[1:21:26] and a cult leader cannot be voted out
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; because he is the leader.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; But yet you all can vote me out, the
[1:21:37] deacons,
[1:21:38] the trustees.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; So what kind of cult is this
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; to where that the cult leader can be
[1:21:47] voted out and the people can pick
[1:21:49] whoever? Brother Brandham himself said
[1:21:51] that if brother Neville wanted to preach
[1:21:53] Jehovah witness doctrine
[1:21:57] and that's what the church wanted even
[1:21:59] brother Brandham couldn't stop it
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; well praise the Lord
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; now you see when we get in his proper
[1:22:07] perspective then we can see where
[1:22:09] reverence and honor and respect and
[1:22:12] servitude all goes together so then the
[1:22:16] men of God should be respected yes but
[1:22:18] their respect ed not as great and big
[1:22:22] and marvelous and wonderful, but they're
[1:22:24] they're to be respected because of their
[1:22:27] servitude to the body of God and also
[1:22:31] the master's use.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Now watch. So Jesus says, "It shall not
[1:22:36] be so among you. Whosoever shall be
[1:22:39] great among you shall be your minister,
[1:22:42] and whosoever of you will be the
[1:22:44] chiefest shall be servant of all." How
[1:22:47] could he say this? Because this is what
[1:22:49] he done. This is what he done. For even
[1:22:52] the Son of Man came not to be ministered
[1:22:56] unto, but to minister to give his life a
[1:23:01] ransom for
[1:23:04] many.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; You mean not everybody?
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Read your Bible.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; For many. Mark 9:33.
[1:23:13] And he came to Capernaum. And being in
[1:23:15] the house, he asked them, "What was it
[1:23:18] you disputed among yourselves, by the
[1:23:20] way? But they had held their peace."
[1:23:24] Well, Jesus knows how to shut us up,
[1:23:26] don't he? For by the way, they had
[1:23:29] disputed. Now, remember this is leading
[1:23:32] up to what we just read. They had
[1:23:34] disputed among themselves
[1:23:38] who should be the greatest.
[1:23:41] And he sat down and called the twel and
[1:23:43] saith unto them, "If any man desire to
[1:23:45] be first, the same shall be last of all,
[1:23:51] and servant of all." And he took a child
[1:23:55] and set him in the midst of them. So
[1:23:59] here's Dr. Simon Peter and Dr. John, Dr.
[1:24:04] James, and Dr. Jude, and Bartholomew and
[1:24:08] all the rest of them. And Jesus picks
[1:24:10] this little bitty old young and he said,
[1:24:11] "Come here, little fella." And Jesus
[1:24:14] just sets them right amongst them big
[1:24:16] preachers and he said, "Boys, right
[1:24:19] here's your example.
[1:24:23] Here's your example.
[1:24:27] Patience.
[1:24:29] I don't mind telling you I'm not glad
[1:24:31] God just gave me grace, but I'm glad
[1:24:33] after God saved me that God still had
[1:24:37] patience with me. I don't know about you
[1:24:40] in your walk, but I I still need God to
[1:24:43] have patience with me. Although I've
[1:24:46] been a saved most of my life, been
[1:24:47] preaching most of my life, but I still
[1:24:51] mess up. Anybody here still mess up and
[1:24:55] make mistakes and well
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; well Carol honey
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; I guess this sermon wasn't just for me
[1:25:01] and you. Bless your heart, little
[1:25:02] darling. Wow. There must be some more
[1:25:05] folks here just like us. I know there's
[1:25:07] some of you who come here and you're
[1:25:08] absolutely perfect and you just that's
[1:25:10] why you just don't like my preaching
[1:25:12] because you're so perfect and you're
[1:25:13] looking for a perfect preacher. Well, I
[1:25:15] hope you find him. Amen.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; I know a lot of the ones around the
[1:25:19] world today and I've met a lot of them.
[1:25:22] All the nations of the world that I've
[1:25:23] been. I ain't never found one yet. Of
[1:25:26] course, it's possible there could be one
[1:25:27] out there. A perfect preacher with a
[1:25:29] perfect church. But I beg you, please
[1:25:32] don't move there because if you do,
[1:25:34] you'll mess up the whole thing.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; I don't like you. I'll tell you one
[1:25:41] thing. You beat that. You know what?
[1:25:42] That may be the kind of preaching you
[1:25:44] need to set under.
[1:25:46] Now watch Jesus humiliating them.
[1:25:50] Brother Rob, can you imagine the
[1:25:51] patience
[1:25:53] that Jesus had to have?
[1:25:56] He took a child and sent them in the
[1:25:58] midst of them when he had taken up in
[1:25:59] his arms and said unto them, "Whosoever
[1:26:03] shall receive one of such children in my
[1:26:05] name receiveth me. Whosoever shall
[1:26:08] receive me receiveth not me but him that
[1:26:11] sent me." And John answered, saying,
[1:26:14] Master, we saw one casting out devils in
[1:26:17] thy name.
[1:26:19] He followth not us.
[1:26:24] And we forbade him. Glory to God.
[1:26:28] Hallelujah.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; He wasn't in our ranks of the message.
[1:26:32] And we just flat told him, "You don't
[1:26:35] belong in the message."
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Patience. Patience.
[1:26:44] Now, I want you to notice the reason
[1:26:47] that John says they done this.
[1:26:50] Do you think it was just by happen
[1:26:52] stance that Jesus called James and John
[1:26:58] the sons of thunder?
[1:27:07] Not the sons of life.
[1:27:11] Not the sons of God, but the sons of
[1:27:14] thunder. We've got a few sons and
[1:27:17] daughters of thunder in our church.
[1:27:21] Woo! Rumble, rumble, rumble.
[1:27:25] Oh my.
[1:27:27] So to me it is such a miracle to see
[1:27:31] what God did with this man who was
[1:27:34] transformed and turned into the most
[1:27:38] beloved disciple
[1:27:40] of the New Testament who started out as
[1:27:44] a son of thunder.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; There's hope for me sure as a world.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go ahead and say for the
[1:27:52] rest of you, there's hope for the rest
[1:27:54] of you. Amen.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Forbid him not, for there
[1:28:03] is no man which shall do a miracle in my
[1:28:08] name that can lightly speak evil of me.
[1:28:13] For he that is not against us
[1:28:17] is on our part." But look at
[1:28:20] sectarianism.
[1:28:22] how it's already among the message 2,000
[1:28:26] years ago.
[1:28:28] So maybe this brother was just doing on
[1:28:31] and you know he wasn't called by Jesus
[1:28:32] to be among the original 12 but he's out
[1:28:35] there and he heard about the message and
[1:28:36] he just had a burden to go do it. Lance
[1:28:38] and he just doing all that he knows to
[1:28:39] do it. Hey hey hey
[1:28:42] what's your papers?
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Did Jesus ordain you? We want to know.
[1:28:47] We want to see your baptismal
[1:28:49] certificate. Who who signed your
[1:28:51] baptismal certificate? Because Jesus
[1:28:53] signed ours.
[1:28:55] Jesus baptized us. Jesus personally
[1:28:57] called. Did Jesus call you person?
[1:29:00] [Music]
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Sectarianism
[1:29:05] already there on the apostles.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; God forgive us.
[1:29:12] Jesus is close to the end of his
[1:29:14] ministry. Now, those of you that are
[1:29:16] familiar with the setting of St. John
[1:29:18] 13. You know that whenever Satan enters
[1:29:19] into Judas and Jesus goes out, then
[1:29:22] Jesus begins to unveil mysteries in St.
[1:29:25] John 14:15, 16,1 17 on down through
[1:29:28] there only with the elect. So they move
[1:29:30] into a higher sphere of hearing him
[1:29:33] speak words that he never spoke when
[1:29:35] Judas was there. Because you know, God
[1:29:38] knows exactly what to say when Judas
[1:29:40] tops hanging around. Whenever they do
[1:29:41] finally pull away, then he'll really
[1:29:43] start talking to his bride. So this is
[1:29:45] where they are here in St. John 16:29.
[1:29:48] And his disciples said unto him, Lo, now
[1:29:51] thou speakest plainly, and speakest no
[1:29:54] proverb.
[1:29:55] Now are we sure that thou knowest all
[1:29:59] things, and needest not that any man
[1:30:02] should ask thee, By this we believe,
[1:30:06] that thou camest forth from God?
[1:30:10] And Jesus answered them,
[1:30:13] "Do you now believe?
[1:30:17] You mean just now?"
[1:30:21] You finally caught it. I'm a few hours
[1:30:24] from the cross
[1:30:26] after three and a half years
[1:30:29] of hearing me teach and preach and live
[1:30:33] the word and walk the word. And you all
[1:30:36] are finally convinced.
[1:30:40] Thank God for patience.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Now let's watch page 40 of Statue of a
[1:30:48] Perfect Man. The prophet said we should
[1:30:51] have patience with one another, too.
[1:30:54] See, one time we get so impatient with
[1:30:57] one anothers and we think we got to be
[1:30:59] like Moses. Moses had patience with the
[1:31:01] people and look what it caused them not
[1:31:03] to go over. See, if you're trying to do
[1:31:06] something like I've tried to get this
[1:31:08] message over to the tabernacle
[1:31:12] to see that each member of the
[1:31:14] tabernacle becomes this. Now listen at
[1:31:18] his desire that each member of the
[1:31:21] tabernacle becomes this. What what he's
[1:31:24] preaching stature of a perfect man.
[1:31:28] It's hard to do. I've tried to have
[1:31:32] patience.
[1:31:34] This is 33
[1:31:36] years
[1:31:39] to have patience.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; And I've been the pastor of this church
[1:31:44] for over 37.
[1:31:49] And some of you that are visitors here
[1:31:51] today, maybe your pastor has been your
[1:31:52] pastor for 35 or 40 or however long.
[1:31:57] Preachers have to have patience, too.
[1:32:00] Yes.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; And people have to have patience with
[1:32:06] the preacher
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; and God has to have patience with us
[1:32:10] all.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Sometimes musicians have to have
[1:32:14] patience with the singers.
[1:32:17] Some singers know when to come in when
[1:32:20] the musicians will give an intro. Some
[1:32:22] don't need an intro. Some just hear the
[1:32:24] note and they're able to catch up. Other
[1:32:26] singers, they never know the
[1:32:28] synchronization of time. So whether it's
[1:32:30] a downbeat or an upbeat, whether they're
[1:32:32] supposed to come in on a flat or a minor
[1:32:34] or a major or seventh or a diminish,
[1:32:36] they don't even know. So then the the
[1:32:38] the musicians will constantly have to
[1:32:42] adjust and they're adjusting for the
[1:32:46] singer because the singer just can't get
[1:32:49] it. Although once they get started, they
[1:32:51] do a good job, but they don't know when
[1:32:52] to come in, they don't know when to go
[1:32:54] out, they don't know when to allow for
[1:32:55] the intro, the turnaround, and they're
[1:32:57] just meandering everywhere. and the
[1:32:59] brothers can be able to kind of cover up
[1:33:02] unless it's really bad.
[1:33:04] So what do they do? They need patience.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Then the song leader needs patience with
[1:33:10] the congregation.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; And the congregation needs patience with
[1:33:15] the song leader.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Or song leaders maybe I should say.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; So no matter what position we hold, we
[1:33:25] all need patience with one another. But
[1:33:29] sometimes it's hard to do
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; cuz we've all got different makeups and
[1:33:34] most all of us have got flaws.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Now here, brother Brandham, I
[1:33:42] love I love his honesty. And he's just
[1:33:44] expressing it from a preacher's
[1:33:46] perspective. And he said to see each
[1:33:48] member of the tabernacle become this and
[1:33:50] it's hard to do. I've tried to have
[1:33:52] patience. This is 33 years to have
[1:33:54] patience. Women still bob their hair
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; at Brandom Tabernacle.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Women still bob their hair just the
[1:34:12] same, but you have patience. Wait, you
[1:34:16] have to. If you ain't got it, don't try
[1:34:19] to build on this down here. So you
[1:34:21] imagine that women when he preaches
[1:34:24] marriage and divorce, he said he had
[1:34:25] people sitting there in his church that
[1:34:27] had been married three and four times
[1:34:30] following the prophet's message.
[1:34:34] remember seeing the vision or the dream
[1:34:36] rather that his mother had and him
[1:34:38] talking about the interpretation of it
[1:34:41] and the woman going up the three steps
[1:34:43] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:34:46] the Holy Ghost and she had on a big pair
[1:34:47] of high heel shoes and she gets up there
[1:34:50] and starts down that and the prophet
[1:34:52] told her you can't walk that road with
[1:34:54] them on
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; yeah she pay no attention to him they
[1:34:58] don't know what he's talking about
[1:35:00] and she gets up there starts walking
[1:35:02] down through there and she gets tipsy
[1:35:04] and toppsy and all that sort of thing
[1:35:06] which he said the Bible prophesied in
[1:35:08] Isaiah that's the way they'd be and the
[1:35:11] woman gets up there walking down that
[1:35:13] road and she falls off the road and here
[1:35:16] she falls screaming
[1:35:19] and then he takes the analogy of that
[1:35:20] story and said it shows that Pentecostal
[1:35:23] women can be justified, sanctified,
[1:35:26] filled with the Holy Ghost and leave off
[1:35:28] one word and miss it.
[1:35:33] So you preach on love, you preach on
[1:35:34] forgiveness, you preach against splits,
[1:35:37] you preach against tight clothes, you
[1:35:39] preach against revealing dresses,
[1:35:41] [Music]
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; and people do it anyhow.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; I'm convinced people's going to do what
[1:35:47] they want to do.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; And if that's so, that means I can.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; So I choose to live right.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; What about some of the rest of y'all?
[1:35:56] What do y'all choose to do? You want to
[1:35:58] live right? You want to rebel? You want
[1:36:00] to go to heaven? you want to be in the
[1:36:02] bride, it's up to you. Look, because
[1:36:04] people choose in the negative side and
[1:36:07] we focus so much on that. But there's
[1:36:09] also some choosing on the positive side.
[1:36:13] If preachers can preach, if they can
[1:36:15] choose to preach things that ain't
[1:36:17] right, that also means that I can choose
[1:36:19] to preach what is right. If preachers
[1:36:22] want to give half their all, that means
[1:36:24] I can choose to give him my all in all.
[1:36:27] Is that right, brothers and sisters?
[1:36:29] Amen.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; But it comes down to us having patience
[1:36:34] with one another and not running out
[1:36:37] because some people certainly know how
[1:36:40] to try our patience.
[1:36:47] Maybe I should say 42 Hail Mary before I
[1:36:49] go from this point on. You think I don't
[1:36:51] know.
[1:36:54] Notice he says even one time when that
[1:36:56] rebellious bunch of people had such
[1:36:59] impatience they had caused Moses to do
[1:37:02] something that was wrong. Yet when it
[1:37:04] come to the showdown, God got sick of
[1:37:06] their action. He said, "Separate
[1:37:07] yourself." And Moses, he said, "I'll
[1:37:09] kill the whole bunch and start a new."
[1:37:12] He throwed himself in the breach and
[1:37:14] said, "God, don't do it." what
[1:37:18] patience with the people that was
[1:37:21] rebelling
[1:37:23] against him. Now, what was that in
[1:37:26] Moses? Spirit of Christ.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; What is it in a pastor? Now, a pastor is
[1:37:33] going to need a measure of patience in a
[1:37:35] different way than an evangelist.
[1:37:36] Evangelist goes in, he preaches to
[1:37:38] people and he knows them by name, you
[1:37:40] know, and by face and so on. and he may
[1:37:42] have their phone number and they may
[1:37:43] text him for prayer and have a personal
[1:37:45] contact, but he goes in and preaches and
[1:37:47] he goes right back home and then next
[1:37:49] weekend is somewhere else and the next
[1:37:50] Wednesday somewhere else and somewhere
[1:37:52] else and somewhere else. But you know
[1:37:54] the prophet had a reason when he
[1:37:56] identified the pastor as being the ox of
[1:38:00] the team,
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; the ox. Now, he wasn't talking about his
[1:38:04] smell, but he was talking about his
[1:38:07] strength, his ability to bear the load.
[1:38:12] The ox being the one that would be so
[1:38:15] burdened down, dealing with the same
[1:38:17] people week after week after week and
[1:38:20] their same shortcomings and their same
[1:38:23] problems and dealing with them for
[1:38:25] decades.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:29] and yet still be leaving God for them
[1:38:32] and having patience with them. I'm glad
[1:38:35] I don't know who's going to be saved cuz
[1:38:37] I got to be honest as a human being if I
[1:38:39] know this is ain't is ain't is ain't I'd
[1:38:42] probably just kind of hone it down a
[1:38:44] little bit narrower and the hints
[1:38:46] wouldn't get a whole lot from me. I'd
[1:38:48] focus on the his not the hints. Don't
[1:38:51] sit there and look at me like a bunch of
[1:38:52] angels. You do the exact same thing. So
[1:38:55] I'm glad I don't know who is and who
[1:38:58] ain't. Well, I look at it. I'm going to
[1:39:00] treat everybody as potential seed of
[1:39:03] God. If I'm going to error, I'm going to
[1:39:06] error toward nice. I'm going to error
[1:39:09] toward kindness and toward love and
[1:39:12] toward mercy. Come on, somebody.
[1:39:15] Everything I do, I do it as unto the
[1:39:18] Lord. That way, I never lose. Every
[1:39:21] individual that I counsel in my office
[1:39:23] where I show up at 5 in the morning or 7
[1:39:25] in the morning or I stay till I can't
[1:39:27] hardly put one foot in front of the
[1:39:29] other after I preach under the anointing
[1:39:31] for an hour, hour and a half, whatever
[1:39:32] it is. I do it as unto the Lord. That
[1:39:36] way I never lose. Not one minute have I
[1:39:39] ever lost in talking to people. Not one
[1:39:42] minute have I ever lost in studying
[1:39:44] hours and hours. Not one minute have I
[1:39:47] ever lost in preaching something and
[1:39:50] watch people do the opposite because I'm
[1:39:52] doing it as unto the Lord Jesus. And I
[1:39:56] will be blessed for it. Is that right?
[1:39:58] You will be blessed for it if you live
[1:40:00] it and believe it whether or not
[1:40:02] everybody else does. And if you don't
[1:40:05] have that focus before you, you'll be so
[1:40:07] discouraged. You won't know what to do.
[1:40:10] Let me just say it to the musicians. Let
[1:40:12] me say it to the singers and the song
[1:40:14] leaders and the deacons and the trustees
[1:40:16] and the Sunday school teachers and all
[1:40:18] those that give and give and you study
[1:40:21] and sometimes the kids don't even show
[1:40:23] up. Don't you let that determine what
[1:40:26] you do nor how much effort you put into
[1:40:29] it. And you sing and you sing. Every
[1:40:31] time you stand up here, sing as if Jesus
[1:40:34] was sitting right there and Jesus was
[1:40:36] the only one in this church. Do it as
[1:40:39] unto the Lord. Preacher brothers, every
[1:40:42] sermon you preach, preach it as unto the
[1:40:45] Lord. Deacon brothers, everything you
[1:40:48] all do, do it as unto the Lord. Oh, I
[1:40:50] feel like preaching now. I wish somebody
[1:40:52] would help me. That way, we never lose.
[1:40:55] And what are we doing? We are allowing
[1:40:58] God to bring into us the measure of
[1:41:02] patience that he knows we need.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Notice this in the seeds not air
[1:41:10] of the shop. How will you know? How will
[1:41:12] the world know that you love Jesus? When
[1:41:15] we love one another, that's what the
[1:41:17] world will see. God sees your faith and
[1:41:19] the world sees your action. Love one
[1:41:21] another. Now be kind one to another.
[1:41:24] Talk with one another. Be patient.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; With God
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; with one another. 1 Thessalonians 5:14,
[1:41:36] I will exhort you, brethren. Warn them
[1:41:38] that are unruly. Comfort the
[1:41:41] feeble-minded.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; So remember me with this verse every
[1:41:45] time you read about it, okay? Comfort
[1:41:46] the feeble-minded. Support the weak.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Be patient toward all of those in your
[1:41:53] intermediate family and then everybody
[1:41:56] else. Go off on all the rest of them.
[1:41:59] Surely
[1:42:01] Paul did not mean all.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. Y'all don't believe
[1:42:07] that. No, no.
[1:42:10] They're living in the time of Roman
[1:42:12] persecution
[1:42:13] when their brothers are being hacked to
[1:42:16] pieces.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Their children are being taken out of
[1:42:21] their message churches.
[1:42:24] And they would take sheep skins and wrap
[1:42:27] around their children's bodies
[1:42:29] and put them out in the coliseum.
[1:42:33] And then they would have a teenager or a
[1:42:36] 20-year-old message follower
[1:42:39] out there in front of them sheep and
[1:42:42] take a hook and he would lead these
[1:42:44] little children, five, six, seven,
[1:42:46] eight, nine years old.
[1:42:49] And that shepherd would tell them, "Now
[1:42:51] follow me and say this.
[1:42:55] And here would come them little message
[1:42:57] kids
[1:42:59] and they would be running in the
[1:43:00] coliseum and they'd turn in jaguars,
[1:43:04] leopards, lions
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; and you see a Roman soldier on the
[1:43:12] street and you're to be patient with
[1:43:15] him, you'd feel like spitting on him,
[1:43:17] smacking him in the face, whatever.
[1:43:20] As I said friends,
[1:43:22] everybody can't attain to this.
[1:43:26] This is not for everybody,
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; but it's for somebody.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; And I'm one of them bodies. Amen.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine when Neero had such a
[1:43:44] beautiful garden
[1:43:46] and yet he would take the Roman
[1:43:48] Christians and instead of having
[1:43:50] torches, he loved to walk in the garden
[1:43:52] in the nighttime. So he'd take part of
[1:43:54] our family members, brothers and
[1:43:56] sisters, and wrap their bodies and dip
[1:43:59] them in pitch tar t a r. And when it got
[1:44:04] dark, they would light them on fire
[1:44:08] two by two by two by two by two. And he
[1:44:12] would walk out in the gardens as they're
[1:44:15] screaming and hollering and their flesh
[1:44:18] is melting like wax on a candle.
[1:44:23] And you mean to tell me I
[1:44:26] am to have patience
[1:44:29] towards such people?
[1:44:31] Actually
[1:44:33] them type of people
[1:44:36] need more sympathy
[1:44:38] than those who are saved. Right
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; now, let's let's look in reality here
[1:44:44] this morning that
[1:44:47] people that are lovable,
[1:44:50] people that have a human makeup and a
[1:44:52] nature about them and they're just
[1:44:53] really lovable and likable,
[1:44:57] they are going to tend to be the ones
[1:45:00] that more people will gravitate toward
[1:45:04] and ones that aren't so likable and
[1:45:07] aren't so lovable. I'm talking about
[1:45:08] their humanity now.
[1:45:11] We tend to just kind of stay away from
[1:45:13] it and give them space as if though they
[1:45:18] don't need love. But in reality,
[1:45:22] sometimes they need it worse
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; than the one who is so lovable.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; Because that person is like a magnet.
[1:45:30] that lovable one, that personality, it
[1:45:33] just draws and people just love being
[1:45:34] around them and they just love they're
[1:45:36] they're so easy to love.
[1:45:40] Got anybody like that that you know of
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; in your home? I mean in your house.
[1:45:50] You see what this is?
[1:45:53] The prophet says, "Were you ever around
[1:45:55] someone that you just love to be
[1:45:56] around?" And you had those people, what
[1:46:00] is it? It's become because of atmosphere
[1:46:03] that they create around them. And you've
[1:46:05] been nice people, but yet you couldn't
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Whoa.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; stand to be around them.
[1:46:16] Now, from this point on, everybody can
[1:46:17] take your hands and put on your face
[1:46:19] like this. And I will, too. and I'll
[1:46:21] finish the sermon with nobody looking at
[1:46:22] nobody.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; This is one thing, friends, I love I
[1:46:29] absolutely love about this message, the
[1:46:32] honesty of this prophet of God.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:46:40] You've been in nice people, but yet you
[1:46:43] couldn't stand to be around them. It's
[1:46:45] their atmosphere.
[1:46:48] It's love. Love goes out deep. It does
[1:46:51] great things. And Jesus Christ is the
[1:46:54] love of God. Again, he says, "Now, did
[1:46:56] you ever see people, they were nice
[1:46:58] people, but you just couldn't hardly
[1:47:01] stand
[1:47:03] to be around?" So, he as he asks the
[1:47:06] question, then he answers it. So, you
[1:47:08] wonder why I do that sometimes? I'm
[1:47:10] following what the prophet did. Sure you
[1:47:12] have.
[1:47:15] Sure you have. You don't have nothing
[1:47:17] against them, but you can't stand to be
[1:47:20] around them. Then you've seen some
[1:47:22] person that's maybe a little old scrawny
[1:47:25] fella or a little woman bent over a wash
[1:47:29] tub, but you just love to be around that
[1:47:32] person. You just love them somehow. It's
[1:47:35] the atmosphere that they've got around
[1:47:37] them. The way they live, they create an
[1:47:42] atmosphere that you like to be into.
[1:47:47] That's lovely people to be with. Again,
[1:47:51] loving part. Now, do you realize being a
[1:47:54] son or daughter of God that you're a
[1:47:56] minor creator? Do you know you create
[1:47:59] the atmosphere that you live in? Do you
[1:48:02] realize that the atmosphere that you
[1:48:05] dwell in? Now remember all of us do
[1:48:08] this. It's totally unconscious to us
[1:48:12] every day. Every moment of the day we're
[1:48:16] pulsating. It's from the word that he
[1:48:18] used called dynamo.
[1:48:22] So it's a dynamo from within our being
[1:48:26] and we create this and we put it out.
[1:48:30] For some it's self-pity.
[1:48:32] For other it's it's anxiety and stress
[1:48:35] and they're just always so nervous and
[1:48:37] and you're perfectly fine that you get
[1:48:38] around them and next thing you know
[1:48:39] you're jerking and you're quivering and
[1:48:41] your lips are shaking and your fingers
[1:48:42] you know you think Lord have mercy. What
[1:48:45] in the world is the matter with me? It's
[1:48:47] because their dynamo was so strong they
[1:48:50] pulled you right into the dynamo of
[1:48:53] their own atmosphere and you become
[1:48:55] unnerved like them.
[1:48:58] And somebody said
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; now he said do you know realize then
[1:49:04] that the atmosphere that you dwell in
[1:49:07] you influence somebody else what makes
[1:49:11] people act the way they do? What makes
[1:49:14] the drunks act like to be drunks? As my
[1:49:17] mother used to say the old proverb that
[1:49:19] I think it's southern here too. Birds of
[1:49:21] a feather flock together because they
[1:49:23] have things in common.
[1:49:26] As you live, so is your character mold
[1:49:29] you to what you are. Now, you've seen
[1:49:31] people that you just love to be around.
[1:49:33] Yet, they might not exactly be in your
[1:49:36] bracket of society.
[1:49:40] So, you're saying, well, by society and
[1:49:42] by how much we make and you know, these
[1:49:44] certain businessmen hang together and
[1:49:46] you know, these because of this and
[1:49:47] this. No, no. You see, atmosphere
[1:49:50] actually breaks over the brackets that
[1:49:53] we make.
[1:49:55] Come on
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; now. Listen. Because the atmosphere
[1:49:57] itself prompt a person that is not
[1:50:00] trying to be a smart alec now are not
[1:50:03] trying to overpower others. Now you've
[1:50:05] seen people and you know as well as I do
[1:50:07] that when you get in their presence they
[1:50:09] are going to control somebody and that
[1:50:12] little gathering if it's the last thing
[1:50:13] they do before it's dismissed because
[1:50:16] it's something about them. They had this
[1:50:18] strong persona and they must conquer
[1:50:22] somebody while they're together. If it
[1:50:25] ain't nobody but a child or a helpless
[1:50:27] older man or woman or whatever it is,
[1:50:30] they will dominate somebody while
[1:50:33] they're gathered together.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Now notice he said yet
[1:50:39] maybe not exactly into your bracket of
[1:50:41] society and then they might be of a
[1:50:44] different
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; race. Ah, so this goes beyond race, the
[1:50:50] color, the brown or the yellow, but
[1:50:52] there just something about that
[1:50:54] character that you just love to be in
[1:50:58] their presence
[1:51:00] because each person is a little dynamo
[1:51:05] of their own. Now, you know what a
[1:51:07] dynamo does, right? You know what a
[1:51:08] dynamo does? So, it generates. Now I
[1:51:10] can't explain the scientific ways of it
[1:51:12] but it it generates and it spins around
[1:51:15] and it's creating something. So they
[1:51:17] study it by velocity, gravitation, all
[1:51:19] kinds of things they use dynamos for and
[1:51:21] it spins out this something and it
[1:51:23] creates this element by which scientists
[1:51:26] are able to study relativity and all
[1:51:27] different kinds of things. And this is
[1:51:29] what each one of us have. Now there's
[1:51:32] sometimes there's people that's very
[1:51:33] misunderstood and that's the ones that
[1:51:35] are very very quiet. They're quiet and
[1:51:37] they have a hard time talking before
[1:51:39] people and they have a really hard time,
[1:51:41] you know, just being able to to express
[1:51:43] and they get around people and they get
[1:51:45] really really nervous. And then by them
[1:51:47] being so nervous, then it makes the
[1:51:48] other people they're around nervous and
[1:51:50] it makes it very hard for them to have
[1:51:52] very many friends. And yet people
[1:51:54] sometimes will look at that type of an
[1:51:56] individual and say, "I believe that
[1:51:58] person is just so stuck up. They are
[1:52:00] just so stuck up. They won't talk to
[1:52:02] nobody." And yet you and I can misjudge
[1:52:06] the dynamo that is reverberating from
[1:52:09] their personality because sometimes they
[1:52:12] can be similar and we're thinking
[1:52:14] they're stuck up when in reality they're
[1:52:16] just so nervous and they don't have
[1:52:18] confidence in their speech. And the more
[1:52:21] nervous they get and the more they try
[1:52:23] to talk, the more they mess up and then
[1:52:25] the more embarrassing it is for them.
[1:52:27] And then the next time they get around
[1:52:29] somebody else, they don't say anything
[1:52:30] at all cuz they're just so afraid that
[1:52:33] they're going to say something. And yet
[1:52:34] that dynamo within them is still
[1:52:36] spinning them and you get around them,
[1:52:38] you feel really uncomfortable and feel
[1:52:40] like you can't be yourself.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; Is there any of us here willing to try
[1:52:47] to help people when they get stuck in
[1:52:48] their dynamo
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; to help them out of their hard times?
[1:52:53] Anybody here ever feel rejected or felt
[1:52:56] rejected in your life?
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Me too. Most of my life. Even now,
[1:53:04] brother Donnie. Even now.
[1:53:07] It's not a good feeling, is it?
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; It's not a pleasant feeling. Especially
[1:53:12] among your camaraderie. Now, you can
[1:53:15] understand from the world itself being
[1:53:17] alienated by them. Oh my. But God gives
[1:53:21] us the ability to be able to understand
[1:53:24] and look and say, "Okay, what would
[1:53:26] Jesus do if Jesus was here?" If Jesus
[1:53:29] was using my body, what would Jesus do
[1:53:33] to help me project an atmosphere that I
[1:53:37] can be able to reach out to people? Now,
[1:53:39] many times whenever I will have
[1:53:41] counseling after service, sometimes the
[1:53:44] only some people ever see me is whenever
[1:53:46] I'm out here preaching. And whenever you
[1:53:49] get under a certain anointing, I can't
[1:53:51] explain it to you, but other than this,
[1:53:52] when you get under the spirit of God, it
[1:53:54] will take over your body and it will use
[1:53:56] you in such a way. And you think that's
[1:53:58] my human makeup by the way the spirit of
[1:54:01] God is using it. And it ain't mine at
[1:54:03] all. I'm totally different from what
[1:54:04] you'll see because it ain't God
[1:54:06] anointing me. It's God anointing his
[1:54:09] gift. And then that'll take over. So
[1:54:11] sometimes whenever they'll come back in
[1:54:13] the office and they'll need a little bit
[1:54:14] of counseling, I can I can watch them.
[1:54:16] And I watch people and I study people
[1:54:18] and I I'll see their lips. If their lips
[1:54:20] are quivering a little bit and if
[1:54:22] they've got a handkerchief in their
[1:54:23] hand, I'll watch as they're going back
[1:54:24] and forth between their fingers or their
[1:54:26] leg is bouncing, their knee is bouncing
[1:54:28] or or they won't look at me in the face.
[1:54:30] Their eyes are going back and forth or
[1:54:32] up and down sometimes. And I will when I
[1:54:35] see that, I will try to say something to
[1:54:38] them to help them relax. I might even
[1:54:40] say something that's funny, you know,
[1:54:42] something like this. You can be calm,
[1:54:44] sister. I never have killed anybody yet.
[1:54:47] You know, I'm doing that for a reason.
[1:54:49] I'm not trying to be a jokester. I'm not
[1:54:51] trying to say something, but I can pick
[1:54:54] that up on them and see how they are.
[1:54:56] And then if I can get them calmed enough
[1:54:59] that I can pull them into my atmosphere
[1:55:02] to my atmosphere for them is I'm there
[1:55:06] to help them. Then if they can feel
[1:55:08] comfortable moving into that atmosphere
[1:55:11] and Carol can tell you that we have
[1:55:13] witnessed it thousands of times through
[1:55:15] the years. And she said, "Donnie, I wish
[1:55:18] so times, so many times I could write
[1:55:20] down what the spirit of God gives you."
[1:55:22] She said, "It was be so a blessing to
[1:55:25] people." And I feel the same way.
[1:55:27] Sometimes I'm sitting there, people
[1:55:29] asking me questions, I don't know a bit
[1:55:30] more the answer than the man in the
[1:55:32] moon, and all of a sudden in a split
[1:55:34] second, here will come the answer down.
[1:55:36] I feel like saying, "Pardon me while I
[1:55:37] go run for a minute." Because it was
[1:55:40] beyond my knowledge. It was beyond my
[1:55:42] understanding. But I've also seen it to
[1:55:45] where I would try to pull people into
[1:55:47] that environment and they sat there and
[1:55:49] they repelled against me, repelled
[1:55:50] against me, repelled against me. And the
[1:55:52] spirit of God that have questions, I got
[1:55:55] nothing from the Lord. I would try to
[1:55:57] say this and I'd stumble over the
[1:55:58] scripture and I'd stumble over the
[1:56:00] quotes and make the biggest mess ever
[1:56:02] was. You know why? because they were not
[1:56:05] receptive to the spirit of God. And we
[1:56:08] know that there's a right approach to
[1:56:10] every gift. That's the way God does. And
[1:56:13] if we as the children of God could
[1:56:15] understand, we have this dynamo. And
[1:56:18] that's why it does you good sometimes to
[1:56:20] break out of your little click that
[1:56:23] you're in when you feel like, well, you
[1:56:25] know what? When you Why do you stay in
[1:56:27] those clicks? Because you're
[1:56:28] comfortable. But sometimes it does us
[1:56:31] good to move out of our comfort zone to
[1:56:34] be able to reach out to others and say,
[1:56:36] "God, what could I do? Maybe that sister
[1:56:39] needs a friend. Maybe that young girl is
[1:56:41] feeling rejected and she doesn't doesn't
[1:56:43] feel like she's a part of the of the
[1:56:45] youth or whatever more." And God, it's
[1:56:48] amazing what God could do in our lives.
[1:56:51] You as children of God have the ability
[1:56:55] to create.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; Create.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; Now you can create anger. You can create
[1:57:03] temper. You can create turbulence,
[1:57:07] violence, fear, anxiety, nervousness.
[1:57:14] Why would any son or daughter of God
[1:57:17] want to create such hell?
[1:57:24] which is what that is.
[1:57:28] But remember, Satan loves human dynamos.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; And Christians can move under evil
[1:57:38] spirits.
[1:57:43] And that spirit will move over their
[1:57:45] being, capture their dynamo
[1:57:50] and start them in circulation
[1:57:53] to pulsate, to push out,
[1:57:57] to create. You know why? Demons cannot
[1:58:02] create.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; So they must use the works of a creator.
[1:58:15] Let's stand
[1:58:17] if you can get up.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:58:32] How many wants God to use your dynamo?
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, forgive us, Lord.
[1:58:41] I wonder how many things friends in our
[1:58:44] walk with God that we've submitted our
[1:58:47] mouth, our attitude, our influence,
[1:58:50] all those sort of things. And instead of
[1:58:53] being an instrument that God could use,
[1:58:56] Jesus said, "Blessed are the
[1:58:58] peacemakers." Do you ever notice there's
[1:59:01] no biatitude that said, "Blessed are the
[1:59:05] troublemakers."
[1:59:06] But Paul does tell us in the book of
[1:59:08] Romans, mark them
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; which cause divisions among you.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; Mark
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; divisions and contentions
[1:59:23] and have nothing to do with them.
[1:59:28] Mark them. And you realize if they don't
[1:59:31] get changed from that disposition,
[1:59:33] they will be marked by the power of the
[1:59:35] beast.
[1:59:39] Oh,
[1:59:41] patience.
[1:59:45] Give me more, Lord.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; I know some of you is absolutely scared
[1:59:48] death to even say that, ain't you?
[1:59:49] Because you've been going through so
[1:59:50] much stuff since I've been preaching
[1:59:51] this. But he's going to get you to you
[1:59:54] anyway. Will you ask for help or not?
[1:59:57] Look friends,
[1:59:59] whoever they are,
[2:00:01] whoever they are that leave this world
[2:00:05] as his bride,
[2:00:07] they will be so much like him
[2:00:11] that it will be in him in so much that
[2:00:14] the prophet could say she is him.
[2:00:20] Now, if you take 1 Corinthians 13, I
[2:00:22] challenge you to do it sometime.
[2:00:26] And when you go to reading about it and
[2:00:28] say, "Love is this. Love is gentle. Love
[2:00:32] is kind. Love is long-suffering. Love is
[2:00:34] love is love is." Leave love out just
[2:00:37] for this sample and put your name there
[2:00:43] and see how much out of that chapter
[2:00:47] that you can honestly say Donnie is
[2:00:50] patient. Donnie is kind.
[2:00:58] Praise the Lord.
[2:01:01] Don't you love him with all your hearts?
[2:01:04] Let's bow our heads if you would.
[2:01:10] Oh Jesus.
[2:01:16] No doubt every every believer here today
[2:01:20] [Music]
[2:01:22] has had the spirit of God to use you to
[2:01:24] where that he would give you a word for
[2:01:26] someone or an encouragement or a
[2:01:29] testimony or whatever and it just so
[2:01:31] lifted their heart and helps them.
[2:01:35] That's so awesome when God does that. We
[2:01:37] know.
[2:01:39] But then the downside is because of our
[2:01:41] human domino dynamo rather is accessible
[2:01:45] to both God and Satan.
[2:01:49] No doubt most of us could say, "Well,
[2:01:50] there's times to be honest that I got in
[2:01:53] the flesh
[2:01:55] and I wish I hadn't have said this and
[2:01:56] this and this to this person cuz I broke
[2:01:59] their spirit. I discouraged them.
[2:02:01] whatever it is that you done.
[2:02:04] You see, the spirit of God is wanting to
[2:02:06] so live in our soul that he brings our
[2:02:09] body, our spirit, our soul into complete
[2:02:13] control and total headship of the Lord
[2:02:16] Jesus. This will be the crowning of the
[2:02:20] bride in the last days.
[2:02:23] The finale of it will be your body
[2:02:27] changed back to a young man or young
[2:02:29] woman. But before you ever reach that,
[2:02:32] the spirit of God wants to control your
[2:02:34] spirit, imagination, conscience, memory,
[2:02:38] reason, affection, your flesh, see,
[2:02:41] taste, feel, smell, hear, the soul,
[2:02:46] self-will,
[2:02:48] all 11 of those elements to bring us
[2:02:52] under such control that we are a
[2:02:55] tabernacle
[2:02:56] of the living God. Not just Christians.
[2:02:59] Remember they were not called Christians
[2:03:02] at first. Jesus called them disciples.
[2:03:06] What is a disciple? One who can be
[2:03:09] disciplined
[2:03:11] by the teaching of the rabbi.
[2:03:14] That's a disciple. That's where we get
[2:03:16] our word discipline from. Disciplinary.
[2:03:19] All of that. The root word is disciple.
[2:03:22] Discipline. So that's where we get it.
[2:03:24] So Jesus wants disciples that can be
[2:03:27] disciplined. So they hear the word and
[2:03:29] they say, "Lord God, I want to measure
[2:03:30] up to that." Christians can hear the
[2:03:33] word and walk right out and say, "Huh, I
[2:03:35] ain't going to do that. He's crazy. You
[2:03:38] think I'm going to do that? I ain't
[2:03:39] giving that up."
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; But a disciple
[2:03:44] can be disciplined.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; I wonder how many of us today can lift
[2:03:48] our hands before God and say, "Lord,
[2:03:51] remember me today, please.
[2:03:54] Lord Jesus, I raise both of my hands.
[2:03:59] Heavenly Father, I know that this type
[2:04:01] of a service is somber.
[2:04:04] It's a soularching service.
[2:04:08] And Lord, I pray you'd begin with me
[2:04:10] today. Not that I have priority over
[2:04:13] them, but
[2:04:15] to be the servant, to be the leader.
[2:04:18] I need to be right, Lord. If there's
[2:04:21] anything you see in me that displeases
[2:04:23] you, show me, Lord.
[2:04:27] There's anyone that I've harmed, anyone
[2:04:29] that I in the flesh have offended or
[2:04:32] wronged in any way
[2:04:35] with the hundreds of thousands of people
[2:04:37] that I've met over the years. Show me
[2:04:41] I'll make it right, Lord.
[2:04:44] Lord Jesus, I don't want to preach and
[2:04:48] do all kinds of different things in your
[2:04:50] name and to the kingdom of God and then
[2:04:52] stand before you that day and
[2:04:57] have great lacks in my life.
[2:05:00] I haven't been responsible for this,
[2:05:02] responsible for that. I didn't love
[2:05:04] right. I didn't have patience right.
[2:05:08] Father, I desire to be in your image,
[2:05:11] a son of God, a living image of the
[2:05:14] living God. And I'm not the only one
[2:05:16] here today, Lord. I believe there's
[2:05:18] hundreds of people here today that
[2:05:21] desire the same thing.
[2:05:24] But we say to you, be patient with us,
[2:05:28] Lord Jesus.
[2:05:31] Be patient with our message preachers
[2:05:33] the way you were with James and John.
[2:05:36] You see, we still have some that want to
[2:05:39] be the greatest.
[2:05:42] We still have some that you will use
[2:05:44] them and people will get healed in their
[2:05:47] meetings or they'll have great services
[2:05:49] and they just can't stand it. They have
[2:05:51] to brag about it and boast about it.
[2:05:53] Although they say they're giving
[2:05:55] testimony to you by the time they get
[2:05:57] done, we certainly have to wonder since
[2:06:00] they talk about themsel more than they
[2:06:02] did you.
[2:06:04] And Lord, if we're not careful, it's
[2:06:06] easy for us to judge and say, "Well,
[2:06:08] that person ain't got the Holy Ghost,
[2:06:09] and I ain't had nothing to do with
[2:06:11] them." We need patience. Lord,
[2:06:15] I pray that you'd help the youth here,
[2:06:17] Lord, and the adults, the young
[2:06:20] marriage, the singles. Lord God,
[2:06:23] be patient with us, Jesus.
[2:06:28] Only you know where patience runs into
[2:06:31] sfulness. And I know it can be a just a
[2:06:34] slight variation between the degrees,
[2:06:38] but give us wisdom to know, Lord. We
[2:06:40] want to be patient with our children. We
[2:06:42] want to be patient with our
[2:06:43] grandchildren. We want to be patient
[2:06:45] with our youth, but then we don't want
[2:06:47] to be to the spot to where we compromise
[2:06:49] and we think we're working under the
[2:06:51] virtue of patience when actually it's
[2:06:53] not patience at all. Satan is pulling
[2:06:56] one over on us.
[2:06:58] We need your help, Lord.
[2:07:01] Oh Jesus, help me, Father, as the pastor
[2:07:03] of the church.
[2:07:05] I don't know how much longer my life
[2:07:07] will be,
[2:07:09] how much more you'll have me to lead
[2:07:11] this flock, Lord, but how much every
[2:07:13] time I have, I want to lead them in the
[2:07:16] right way. I want to be the kind of man
[2:07:19] that I'll tell them the truth. Well, I
[2:07:20] know I can see it hurts them when I
[2:07:22] preach it and it tears me all to pieces.
[2:07:25] Carol would be a better witness of it
[2:07:27] than anybody else here. what kind of
[2:07:29] shape I get in on Monday.
[2:07:31] And I'll tell her, "Please don't leave
[2:07:34] me by myself today.
[2:07:38] Please, let's let's just get out and
[2:07:40] drive around. Let's do something."
[2:07:44] Because if I'm by myself today, it's
[2:07:47] going to be a bad day.
[2:07:50] Lord, it breaks my heart to have to
[2:07:52] preach hard and say sharp things,
[2:07:56] but I want to follow you, Jesus.
[2:07:59] I pray though it would be sharp that
[2:08:01] they can hear those sharp words from the
[2:08:04] love in my heart that I have for them.
[2:08:07] Mold us, Jesus. Take our deacon
[2:08:10] brothers, Lord. You know that they need
[2:08:12] a lot of patience dealing with your
[2:08:15] people. They have to put up with so many
[2:08:18] things, oh God, and so many things that
[2:08:20] they have to do. And Lord, then the
[2:08:22] brothers in the library and the brothers
[2:08:25] on the internet, they get one little
[2:08:27] glitch and people are calling from
[2:08:29] around the world and people are fussing
[2:08:31] and losing their temper and this and
[2:08:34] that because the internet messed up and
[2:08:37] people almost lose their religion
[2:08:39] sometimes
[2:08:41] whenever they break their signal, which
[2:08:43] expresses to me why they definitely need
[2:08:45] to be streaming if they lose their
[2:08:47] religion that quick. Help us all, Lord.
[2:08:51] to be more patient that we can add to
[2:08:54] our faith virtue to our virtue knowledge
[2:09:00] to our knowledge, oh God, these great
[2:09:03] attributes on and on and on
[2:09:07] until we are ready to leave this world.
[2:09:11] We worship you today, Father. Lord, we
[2:09:14] ask that you'd be mindful of Brother
[2:09:15] Larry Elliott today. you see got sick
[2:09:17] yesterday father before the wedding and
[2:09:21] we pray that you'd be with our brother
[2:09:22] had to spend the night in the hospital
[2:09:24] and Lord they're doing more tests and
[2:09:26] stuff on him today to try to figure out
[2:09:28] what happened be mindful of our brother
[2:09:30] Lord
[2:09:32] Carol and I left the the reception early
[2:09:35] yesterday to go to the hospital to visit
[2:09:38] brother Steve Nuome and his family there
[2:09:41] be mindful of our brother today Lord you
[2:09:44] see dear God that the doctors aren't
[2:09:46] given him much hope at all. But yet,
[2:09:49] Lord, we look beyond that and we're
[2:09:52] praying, heavenly father, that your
[2:09:53] mercy would be extended to our brother.
[2:09:56] Even now, we believe you can raise him
[2:09:59] up from that bed.
[2:10:01] But, Father, what we're concerned about
[2:10:03] and desiring and wanting is the will of
[2:10:06] God for our brother's life. We worship
[2:10:09] you today, Father. We love you, Lord
[2:10:11] Jesus.
[2:10:13] Thank you, Father.
[2:10:16] Harry, can we sing? I need you, Lord. I
[2:10:19] need you, Lord. Right now.
[2:10:23] I need you, Lord.
[2:10:25] I need you, Lord. Can we just worship
[2:10:29] him just a little bit now? Let him let
[2:10:31] him just kind of take us up in his arms.
[2:10:34] You know, I've told you before about my
[2:10:36] two daughters, and they were natured, so
[2:10:38] different. Lis was so mildmannered and
[2:10:40] so easygoing. All I had to do basically
[2:10:43] to Lish was raise my voice and say
[2:10:45] Alicia Yavon.
[2:10:48] That's pretty much all it took. She
[2:10:50] never got a whole lot of spankings in
[2:10:51] her life. But now her baby sister,
[2:10:57] you see these five Parker people
[2:10:59] standing right over here? Every one of
[2:11:00] them's got the same look on their face
[2:11:03] cuz they knew that baby sister.
[2:11:06] And I had to wear her out, whip her over
[2:11:09] and over again. Daddy, how come you whip
[2:11:12] me? Why don't you whip Lish? I'll say
[2:11:15] you behave like Lish and you'll get
[2:11:17] less.
[2:11:21] Well, maybe there's some little Ericas
[2:11:22] in here today and your hide's been wore
[2:11:25] out spiritually by the word. You think,
[2:11:27] man alive, I'd like to go to church one
[2:11:29] service and not be preached on. Well,
[2:11:32] come on. Let that list come out of you.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:39] So I can start just speaking to you
[2:11:41] lightly and say, "Little bride,
[2:11:42] straighten up." And y'all say, "Yes,
[2:11:44] yes, yes." Glory to God. Yes. Amen. But
[2:11:47] until you get there, little Erica, I'm
[2:11:50] going to do whatever I've got to do.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; Do I get weary after 37 years? I do. Do
[2:11:58] I get exhausted? I do. But I ain't
[2:12:02] giving up on you.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; I said I ain't giving up on you. And
[2:12:06] don't you give up on me
[2:12:09] cuz I'm a work in the making, too.
[2:12:14] Amen. We got we got a brother here that
[2:12:16] wants to be baptized today. He was
[2:12:18] rebapt He was baptized rather many years
[2:12:20] ago, but went down as many of us did in
[2:12:23] titles and he's wanting to be rebaptized
[2:12:25] today in the name of our Lord Jesus. But
[2:12:27] let us just worship a little bit now and
[2:12:30] just oh, just enter into his presence.
[2:12:32] Think about what what you've heard
[2:12:34] today. If you have to go back and listen
[2:12:35] to it two or three times, do that so you
[2:12:36] can be able to get it in your heart and
[2:12:38] realize what you are. Walk out of this
[2:12:40] building today knowing I am a creator as
[2:12:44] a son or daughter of God. God, help me
[2:12:47] to create the right things.
[2:12:52] I need you, Lord. Let's
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; just close our eyes if you would.

[2:17:56] Thank you, Lord. There
[2:18:00] you go.
[2:18:02] Praise the Lord.
[2:18:04] What a great honor to be able to stand
[2:18:06] and baptize according to the scripture.
[2:18:10] Imagine if Peter, Paul, the original
[2:18:11] apostles are standing here in this
[2:18:13] church today, how they would rejoice to
[2:18:15] see this great truth which they by the
[2:18:18] spirit of God were able to give to the
[2:18:20] church, knowing no doubt that it would
[2:18:23] be lost and be restored again in the
[2:18:25] last days. Heavenly Father, we thank
[2:18:28] you, Lord, for dealing with our brother.
[2:18:30] We're so grateful, Lord Jesus, to see
[2:18:32] him coming to the house of God and see
[2:18:34] him receiving of your word. We thank you
[2:18:36] for the work that you're doing in his
[2:18:38] life. No doubt, like all the rest of us,
[2:18:40] he needs a lot of work. But I believe
[2:18:43] you are so patient with your children.
[2:18:45] Now, Lord God, I pray for him today.
[2:18:47] Father, may the presence of God just be
[2:18:50] with him. Lord, I can baptize him in
[2:18:52] water correctly according to the
[2:18:53] scripture, but only you can fill every
[2:18:56] fiber of his being, Lord God, with your
[2:18:59] spirit. I pray you'd grant it to my
[2:19:01] brother today, Lord. Give him what he
[2:19:03] has need of to complete this journey in
[2:19:06] a way that's pleasing to you in Jesus
[2:19:09] name.
[2:19:10] Praise the Lord. God bless you, my
[2:19:13] brother. Such a privilege to be able to
[2:19:15] take you today in this watery grave. In
[2:19:18] the name of our bridegroom, I baptize
[2:19:20] you my brother in the name of the Lord
[2:19:22] Jesus Christ.
[2:19:30] God bless you.
[2:19:34] Amen. Certainly appreciate the word of
[2:19:36] the Lord this morning. Amen. Let's sing
[2:19:38] this little course as you're dismissed
[2:19:40] this morning. Shout to the Lord.
[2:19:44] Oh my Jesus,
[2:19:48] my savior.
[2:19:51] Lord, there is none like you.
[2:19:56] All of my days
[2:20:00] I want to praise
[2:20:03] the wonders of your mighty
[2:20:09] love.
[2:20:13] Oh my comfort,
[2:20:16] my shelter,
[2:20:19] tower of reuge and strength.
[2:20:24] Let every breath
[2:20:28] all that I am.
[2:20:31] Never cease to worship
[2:20:36] you.

[2:20:47] Power and majesty
[2:20:50] praise to the king.

[2:20:58] roar at the sound
[2:21:02] of your name.
[2:21:07] I sing for joy at the work of your
[2:21:12] hands.
[2:21:14] Forever I'll love you. Forever
[2:21:19] I'll stand.
[2:21:21] Nothing compares to the promise I have
[2:21:27] in you.

[2:21:36] Oh my Jesus,
[2:21:40] my savior.
[2:21:42] Lord, there is none like you.
[2:21:47] All of my days
[2:21:51] I won't praise the wonders of your
[2:21:56] mighty
[2:21:59] love.
[2:22:03] Oh, you're my comfort,
[2:22:07] my shelter,
[2:22:10] tower of reuge and strength.
[2:22:15] Let every breath,
[2:22:19] all that I am never cease to worship
[2:22:27] you.
[2:22:31] Shout to the Lord all the earth. Let us
[2:22:35] sing.
[2:22:38] Power and majesty
[2:22:41] praise to the King.
[2:22:45] Mountains bow down and the seas will
[2:22:49] roar at the sound
[2:22:53] of your name.
[2:22:58] I'll sing for joy at the work of your
[2:23:03] hands.
[2:23:05] Forever I'll love you. Forever
[2:23:09] I'll stand.
[2:23:12] Nothing compares to the promise I have
[2:23:18] in you.
[2:23:21] Oh, shout to the Lord all the earth. Let
[2:23:27] us sing.
[2:23:29] Power and majesty
[2:23:32] praise to the King.
[2:23:36] Mountains bow down and the seas will
[2:23:41] roar at the sound

[2:24:01] I'll stand.
