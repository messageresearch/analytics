[43:47] let's turn to the Book of Daniel if you
[43:49] would again today chapter
[43:52] 7 verse
[43:54] 10 Daniel chapter 7
[43:57] verse
[43:59] 10 I want to speak to you again today on
[44:02] the
[44:04] right to the god of
[44:07] love the right to the god of
[44:10] love and I'm not saying that you're
[44:12] worthy of this but I'm saying you have a
[44:15] right to it and rights are
[44:20] given
[44:21] given just like with our Bill of Rights
[44:25] thank God our forefathers
[44:27] not only wanted to establish a
[44:30] republic but to be able to some years
[44:33] later also attach what they call the
[44:36] Bill of
[44:38] Rights I'm grateful that the lord gave
[44:41] us not only salvation but also a Bill of
[44:46] Rights Daniel 7:
[44:50] 10 a fiery stream issued and came forth
[44:54] from before
[44:55] him thousand thousand thousands which is
[45:00] myriads in
[45:02] number thousand
[45:05] thousands
[45:06] ministered unto
[45:08] him and 10,000
[45:12] times
[45:13] 10,000 stood before him the Judgment was
[45:18] set and the books were opened 1 John 4:
[45:25] 7 beloved let us love one another for
[45:30] love is of
[45:33] God and everyone that loveth is born of
[45:38] God now we know there's two main words
[45:41] in the Greeks that they used whenever
[45:43] they wrote the New Testament and that
[45:45] was agape and
[45:49] felo and it's not everybody that felo
[45:52] loves other people is born of God only
[45:56] the those who have the ability to
[46:00] Agape beloved let us love one another
[46:02] for love is of God and everyone that
[46:05] love us Agape or
[46:08] agapo everyone that is love us that love
[46:11] us is born of God and knoweth God he
[46:17] that loveth not knoweth not God for God
[46:23] is love so God doesn't just love but God
[46:28] is
[46:29] agape verse 16 and we have known and
[46:34] believed the love that God has to
[46:39] us God is
[46:41] love he that dwelleth in love dwelleth
[46:46] in God again not he that dwelleth in
[46:50] human
[46:51] love and fio love felo love human love
[46:56] has jeal
[46:57] jealousy absolute jealousy sure it does
[47:02] anybody that would try to flirt with any
[47:04] of our brothers that are married here
[47:06] today with our wives or even your
[47:07] girlfriend you know what human love
[47:09] would do it would get mad at that
[47:12] individual if they stepped a little
[47:14] farther into that
[47:15] boundary you might threaten them now I'm
[47:18] warning you stay away from my wife or
[47:21] stay away from my girlfriend would' say
[47:24] now why because that boy that man felo
[47:29] loves his girlfriend or
[47:32] wife but agape love would actually pray
[47:36] for
[47:36] you it might still look at you a little
[47:39] bit Stern but it would pray for
[47:41] you because it's totally impossible for
[47:44] God's love to have that kind of
[47:47] jealousy now you realize where we're
[47:49] going back to when all human love will
[47:54] be gone
[47:56] amen our brothers and sisters our loved
[47:59] ones that are in the sixth Dimension
[48:00] today have no more human
[48:05] love it's all perfect love and I'd like
[48:09] to be remembered today as we pray God
[48:12] bless you let just bow our heads
[48:14] together Heavenly Father what an honor
[48:16] it is for us to be gathered together
[48:18] again today we thank you Lord Jesus that
[48:23] you have allowed us to be able to
[48:25] partake of Your Love
[48:27] dear father we not only want to be
[48:32] benefactors of that love and recipients
[48:34] of that love but we want to become that
[48:38] love and I realize what I'm asking for
[48:41] is a total
[48:44] impossibility without you helping us and
[48:47] actually you doing it for
[48:49] us because it's not in our measure of
[48:52] love to love with
[48:55] agape we just can't do it we could do it
[48:58] in the beginning but once we fail we
[49:01] lost that Inlet and we were so far away
[49:05] from the Fountain of the stream of
[49:08] purity of Love help us today I pray
[49:11] father speak to us your great words we
[49:14] ask in the name of Jesus amen God bless
[49:18] you you may be
[49:22] seated love is not simply a quality
[49:25] which
[49:27] God
[49:28] possesses but love is his very
[49:33] nature it's the essence of who he is and
[49:37] as I mentioned to you last Sunday that
[49:39] every human being on the face of the
[49:41] Earth even
[49:42] today has been able to experience an
[49:45] element of the love of God life breath
[49:49] water food all kinds of things like that
[49:53] that's God's love to the human race
[49:56] believe it or not God actually lets
[49:59] doctors find out cures for different
[50:03] diseases our Prophet told us that he
[50:06] prayed for doctors every day that they
[50:10] would be able to find a cure for cancer
[50:14] right you know why he did that because
[50:16] he loved Humanity he knew some people
[50:19] maybe would never be able to appropriate
[50:21] Faith especially Sinners and unbelievers
[50:23] so he loved Humanity so much that he
[50:26] wanted them to be able to be healed of
[50:29] this Dreadful terrible disease so he
[50:32] prayed that God would help the doctors
[50:34] to be able to understand it I'm grateful
[50:37] for the salt vaccine I'm grateful for
[50:40] many things that God aren't you has
[50:42] allowed them to be able to break into
[50:45] why did he do that because he loved the
[50:48] human race so they experienced the love
[50:50] of God and they don't even realize it
[50:52] but there's a vast difference between
[50:55] experiencing the love of God and having
[50:58] the god of love in your soul and this is
[51:03] where that many people try to live a
[51:05] Christian Life with an experience of the
[51:10] love of God God Saves them God reaches
[51:13] down oh my goodness what God does to a
[51:16] sinner that's lost and can raise them up
[51:19] by justification help them to see that
[51:21] they're on the way to hell as we would
[51:23] say and they need help and the presence
[51:26] of of God will come near them convict
[51:29] them of their sins make them ashamed and
[51:32] they will begin to pray and ask God to
[51:34] forgive them and he does and that is a
[51:36] touch of the love of God in their hearts
[51:39] some of them will go on a little further
[51:41] they will enter into sanctification so
[51:43] they'll lay aside habits unclean things
[51:47] things that they've done for many many
[51:49] years God helps him and it's his love
[51:52] and they feel so much better they feel
[51:55] cleaner in the walk with God and many of
[51:58] them stop right there and they never go
[52:01] on to be able to receive the baptism of
[52:04] the Holy Ghost which is actually God
[52:07] himself coming into their soul now we
[52:10] know the apostles were good men they
[52:13] cast out Devils heal the sick preach the
[52:15] gospel yet Jesus told Peter one day when
[52:18] thou art converted strengthen your
[52:22] brethren so he preached cast out Devils
[52:25] healed the sick done all those wonderful
[52:27] things and he had not yet been converted
[52:31] and you can love the Lord Jesus believe
[52:33] the Lord Jesus actually made a trip to
[52:36] Calvary as we' say and still not be
[52:39] converted now let us go back if we can
[52:42] for just a few moments into the realm of
[52:46] Eternity there is no time there's no
[52:51] molecules there's no light there's no
[52:53] darkness no Angels no planets
[52:57] there's not even any time yet and out of
[53:01] that great essence of this being now
[53:04] let's watch The Prophet's teaching here
[53:07] let's close our eyes to our imagination
[53:09] for a few moments and go back in before
[53:13] there was anything the great Fountain of
[53:16] all eternity that was that Spirit of
[53:21] love joy that Spirit of honesty that
[53:25] spirit of tress in this Perfection and
[53:30] then out of the existence of the father
[53:33] went the logos which was the son so now
[53:38] remember there's not three gods and
[53:40] three different bodies but it's
[53:42] attributes of the same God just like you
[53:45] have today you've got a soul you got a
[53:47] spirit and you've got a body yet you're
[53:50] one person so it's not that your soul
[53:53] has a personality and your spirit is
[53:55] another person personality and your body
[53:57] is another personality but it takes all
[54:00] three of them to make you so here is
[54:03] this and we know that the Bible
[54:04] describes him as being God is light and
[54:09] then John said God is love and then the
[54:12] Bible says our God is a consuming fire
[54:16] so which one is he he's all of that but
[54:19] yet Paul went on to say now unto the
[54:22] king Eternal Immortal invisible the only
[54:27] wise God be Power Glory and Dominion
[54:30] forever so God is
[54:33] invisible but God wanted to become
[54:36] visible and tangible so God actually
[54:40] here we are in this great Fountain so
[54:43] here from the Fountain of of God comes
[54:46] the spirit of love so it's not just love
[54:49] but the spirit of love and the spirit of
[54:53] honesty and the spirit of tress in
[54:56] Perfection and then out of the existence
[54:59] of the father went the logos which was
[55:02] the son so God is giving birth to
[55:06] himself a son what is that son it's the
[55:10] visible
[55:11] representation of an invisible God so
[55:15] God started at this work of condensation
[55:19] now look what happens here which was the
[55:22] theophonic
[55:26] from the word th he EOS which is Theos
[55:29] so it is a Divine body that is not quite
[55:33] human but it has a human look or
[55:38] appearance this is actually what Adam
[55:40] was made in the form of in the Garden of
[55:43] Eden and God said let us make man in our
[55:47] own image after our own likeness now
[55:50] notice God does not say images as in
[55:53] plural or likenesses as in plural but
[55:56] image singular likeness singular so God
[56:01] is a spirit so man took on the spirit
[56:05] image of God and then man also took on
[56:09] the visible image of God which was
[56:13] sunship so God never called man a woman
[56:17] God never called man a daughter but God
[56:20] called him what he was and he was a man
[56:24] you follow me so far now notice then
[56:27] when the out of the existence of the
[56:29] father went the logos which was the son
[56:32] which was the theophany which was the
[56:37] body of the great Jehovah God went force
[56:41] in a Celestial body so what was he
[56:45] before this he was just totally
[56:47] invisible that's the logos the words
[56:51] spoke out of them great Fountains of
[56:55] life
[56:56] and went forth so out of this Fountain
[57:00] of tress out of this Fountain of Life
[57:03] and mercy and goodness and kindness came
[57:07] forth the voice of God and God allowed
[57:11] himself to take on a form that looked
[57:15] like a man yet it wasn't a man in the
[57:19] sense that it could die a theophany
[57:22] cannot die a theophany could be right
[57:25] here in this building this morning and
[57:29] yet you wouldn't be able to see it
[57:31] unless God would allow it to become into
[57:34] a visible form we're limited as far as
[57:38] by dimensional Vision we just can't see
[57:41] it there but yet it's there now notice
[57:44] then he says then at the coming of the
[57:47] Lord Jesus this body NOW Watch What
[57:50] Happens here whenever a person leaves
[57:52] and goes into that they they leave this
[57:56] uh part which God made for them at the
[57:59] beginning he he says let me go back here
[58:02] I was about to jump the gun on you I'm
[58:03] sorry which was the body of the great
[58:06] Jehovah God went forth in a Celestial
[58:08] body that's the logos so the word spoke
[58:12] out of them great Fountains of life and
[58:15] went forth and there was a theophany
[58:17] which was God made into word now
[58:21] remember John says in the beginning was
[58:24] the word and the word was with God and
[58:27] the Word was God and the same was in the
[58:30] beginning with God and without that word
[58:33] of course it goes on to say was not
[58:35] anything made that was made in him was
[58:38] life and the life was the light of men
[58:41] and then he says on down through in
[58:43] those verses that men love Darkness
[58:45] rather than light because their deeds
[58:47] were evil then he goes on to say about
[58:49] John the Baptist there was a man sent
[58:51] from God whose name was John he was not
[58:55] that light but he was sent to Bear
[58:57] witness of the light so God gives us the
[59:00] program of how that God himself came
[59:03] from the realm of Eternity not even
[59:05] visible no time no element that could be
[59:07] measured then God entered into the
[59:10] existence of his own word and then John
[59:13] again John 1 and one in the beginning
[59:15] was the word so what was before the
[59:18] beginning eternity eternity so in the
[59:22] beginning was the word in the beginning
[59:26] was the word the son the logos of God
[59:31] then God created now watch here in the
[59:34] same sermon then that theophany was made
[59:38] flesh in the person Christ Jesus so God
[59:42] created himself a body and it was a
[59:47] theophany Paul says that in 2
[59:49] Corinthians 5:1 for we know if this
[59:50] Earthly House of this Tabernacle were
[59:52] disolved we have the building of God and
[59:54] house not made with hands Eternal in the
[59:57] heavens in this we desire Desiring to be
[1:00:00] clothed upon that mortality might be
[1:00:02] swallowed up of life so it's the body
[1:00:05] that every elect member goes into when
[1:00:10] they die as we say in this life it's
[1:00:13] your
[1:00:14] identification that you are a part of
[1:00:17] deity now what in that the offy was made
[1:00:20] flesh in the person Christ Jesus it goes
[1:00:23] on down to say then we are both born
[1:00:26] again not of Flesh born again not of
[1:00:28] blood born by the spirit and that
[1:00:31] eternal spirit of love and honesty comes
[1:00:36] down to make its place in us now
[1:00:40] remember in our scripture this morning
[1:00:41] John said he that dwelleth in love
[1:00:45] dwelleth in God so it leads us to
[1:00:48] believe them that there are people that
[1:00:51] can have a touch of God and they can be
[1:00:54] affected by God and then that influence
[1:00:57] can actually move away from them and
[1:01:00] then they move back into a natural
[1:01:02] carnal mortal realm and then they do
[1:01:05] whatever they want to do live the way
[1:01:06] they want to live because their
[1:01:08] residence of their soul is not in God
[1:01:12] but if they live in the land The
[1:01:14] Dwelling Place of love it is the
[1:01:17] evidence that they are born of God and
[1:01:21] not just born of Dawn and Betty Reagan
[1:01:23] or whoever your parents are now watch
[1:01:26] whenever this great Eternal in this that
[1:01:29] eternal spirit of love and honesty comes
[1:01:32] down to make its place in us then when
[1:01:34] we die from this life we go into that
[1:01:38] body if this Tabernacle is dissolved we
[1:01:41] have a theophany that we go into a body
[1:01:46] Celestial then at the coming of the Lord
[1:01:49] Jesus this body is picked up oh my from
[1:01:53] the Earth again and man made in a
[1:01:56] glorified state to live in his presence
[1:02:00] forever now this is his great program
[1:02:03] remember God was not blindsided by the
[1:02:07] devil he was not blindsided when Adam
[1:02:09] fell he knew that he would he could not
[1:02:12] make him fall and then reach down and
[1:02:14] pick him up so he could manifest himself
[1:02:17] as a redeemer a savior but he put the
[1:02:20] man on a basis by which he could fall
[1:02:24] that was on a probationary
[1:02:26] period of a time frame however long it
[1:02:29] was to where God put the man now had had
[1:02:32] man come through the theophany first he
[1:02:37] could never have fallen but he must
[1:02:39] bypass the theophany because in the
[1:02:43] theophany you know all things you see
[1:02:46] the Lord Jesus when he come to the Earth
[1:02:50] because he had been in this word formed
[1:02:52] body he knew that he had existed Ed
[1:02:56] before and when he come to this earth he
[1:02:59] brought that knowledge with him he knew
[1:03:03] he had existed he was the one who talked
[1:03:06] to Moses in the burning bush the pillar
[1:03:09] of fire is that right he was the one
[1:03:11] that came down in the fiery furnace to
[1:03:14] the Hebrew children he was the one that
[1:03:16] came down in the den of lies to Daniel
[1:03:19] he's the one when you look back to the
[1:03:21] Old Testament and see any visible
[1:03:24] manifestation of God you know you're
[1:03:27] seeing Christ that was Christ remember
[1:03:30] Moses chose to suffer the reproach of
[1:03:34] Christ but the Bible does not say Jesus
[1:03:38] because Christ was the pre-existing form
[1:03:41] before it ever become Jesus the human
[1:03:44] name I don't want to stagger you this
[1:03:46] morning but you also had a pre-existing
[1:03:49] form before you come to the Earth but it
[1:03:52] was held in the mind of God amen we're
[1:03:56] going back to that but notice if if God
[1:04:00] would have brought Adam through the
[1:04:02] theophany then Adam would have knew he
[1:04:05] existed just like we would have today we
[1:04:07] would sit here today and we would not
[1:04:09] then by faith say well I Believe by
[1:04:12] grace through through faith that I am
[1:04:14] saved anybody here ever actually seen
[1:04:16] your name in The Book of Life have you
[1:04:18] ever seen your theophany do you know by
[1:04:21] knowledge that you were there before the
[1:04:23] foundation of the world no why because
[1:04:25] were coming now on this side of the
[1:04:27] Cross and we're coming through the
[1:04:29] perpetuation made by the blood of the
[1:04:31] Lord Jesus so we believe that it is
[1:04:34] there is that right we believe that we
[1:04:36] are part of it had we have come through
[1:04:39] that theophonic body we would not be
[1:04:41] setting here today I would not be
[1:04:43] preaching because you would not need to
[1:04:45] hear a preacher in that form you could
[1:04:48] not fall so the Lord Jesus allowed
[1:04:52] himself in coming to the Earth in
[1:04:54] another cont sension of that Mighty God
[1:04:57] that he would be able to be tempted and
[1:05:00] tested and tried as another human being
[1:05:03] feel pain anxiety stress worry all that
[1:05:06] sort of thing the Bible says tempted in
[1:05:08] all points like as we are yet without
[1:05:10] sin but all the time having this
[1:05:13] knowledge that he existed before and
[1:05:16] this is why he could say not only by
[1:05:18] Revelation but by that I come forth from
[1:05:22] God and I go back to God you and I say
[1:05:26] that too by faith I honestly believe
[1:05:28] with all of my heart as we get closer to
[1:05:31] the change of our body that the
[1:05:33] revelation of God will strike the elect
[1:05:36] upon the Earth they too by revelation
[1:05:40] will be able to say I come from God I go
[1:05:43] back to God now watch this so here it's
[1:05:47] in its purest form now he said can you
[1:05:50] imagine in the Hebrew series can you
[1:05:53] imagine before there was even an earth
[1:05:55] before before there was a light before
[1:05:57] there was a star before there was
[1:05:59] anything there's a great Fountain going
[1:06:01] forth of spirit out of this Fountain
[1:06:05] came the most pure of love so all of
[1:06:09] this was spirit and spirit is invisible
[1:06:12] so love the love that we know in this
[1:06:16] life and it's true manifestation of
[1:06:18] course is made known by physical things
[1:06:21] that we do and again I want to say to
[1:06:23] each of our our church family here all
[1:06:26] that you've done during this time of the
[1:06:28] flood relief and all that my the
[1:06:30] countless hours that you've spent the
[1:06:32] brothers driving and delivering and the
[1:06:34] sister sorting through it all everything
[1:06:36] that you done it's just been remarkable
[1:06:38] and I thank you for all of that but I
[1:06:41] also realize that had it not been for
[1:06:43] people all all different places of
[1:06:46] America there's been thousands over
[1:06:48] hundreds of thousands of dollars that
[1:06:50] has been sent to our church believe me
[1:06:53] hundreds of thousands of
[1:06:56] that have been sent to our church much
[1:06:58] as it have come of course from my
[1:07:00] acquaintances and the message and
[1:07:02] different ones like that but much is it
[1:07:04] from people that do not even know us and
[1:07:08] people that have brought goods and food
[1:07:10] and things like that from 12 or 13
[1:07:13] states the last account that I heard and
[1:07:16] what is that well that's love and and
[1:07:18] people from Georgia what would they have
[1:07:20] to do with us here in the mountains of
[1:07:22] Tennessee people from Arizona people
[1:07:24] from Kentucky people from all these
[1:07:26] different Avenues and what is that love
[1:07:29] I talked to my neighbor yesterday he
[1:07:31] owns a construction business just knew
[1:07:33] heard a little something of what we was
[1:07:34] doing and he said hey you know what
[1:07:36] we're doing the same thing you hear of
[1:07:37] any of these people I I've got all types
[1:07:40] of equipment they need help let me know
[1:07:42] please let me know I'd be glad to do
[1:07:44] what I can and you realize what is that
[1:07:47] that's a human feeling and all kinds of
[1:07:50] people would do things like that is that
[1:07:52] love yes it's love but then if you would
[1:07:55] sit down with them and tell them look
[1:07:57] good works are good but you're not going
[1:07:59] to be able to go to Heaven by your good
[1:08:01] works you've got to accept the love of
[1:08:03] God and some might say I've accepted the
[1:08:06] love of God I'm a Christian where do you
[1:08:08] go to church well no I I really don't
[1:08:10] think I need to go to church well if you
[1:08:12] have the god of love then you want to
[1:08:15] assemble yourselves together with his
[1:08:17] children because the god of love
[1:08:19] anointed Paul to say forsake not the
[1:08:22] assembling of yourselves together now if
[1:08:24] you re receive the love of God you can
[1:08:26] get saved and you want to stay home it's
[1:08:28] up to you but if you get the god of love
[1:08:30] inside of your heart you realize that
[1:08:33] love craves fellowship with other people
[1:08:37] of God that are the same economy that
[1:08:40] you're of is that right so people can
[1:08:43] love and still not truly be born again
[1:08:46] so whenever it started out though it was
[1:08:49] in this purest form the purest form of
[1:08:52] love is Spirit form now notice because
[1:08:56] there's nothing for it to come from but
[1:08:58] love now we what we call Love Today is a
[1:09:02] perverted love but just as we get an
[1:09:05] Essence listen now an essence or a
[1:09:09] little bit of that love in US it changes
[1:09:14] our whole opinion so when we start
[1:09:17] toward God not just recipients of love
[1:09:20] but we want the god of love I don't want
[1:09:22] just the love of God I want the god of
[1:09:25] love now I'm after and I hope you are
[1:09:29] I'm after that essence of that love that
[1:09:34] essence of that love now watch he said
[1:09:37] the logos this great Fountain that's the
[1:09:39] great Fountain of the spirit which had
[1:09:41] no beginning or no end this great spirit
[1:09:45] be to form in the creation in the
[1:09:49] creation so now here we go back to John
[1:09:51] 1:1 in the beginning was the word so the
[1:09:55] Spirit invisibly begin to form in a
[1:09:58] realm of Senses you know in the realm of
[1:10:01] tangibility want to become tangible and
[1:10:04] he said this great the logos the great
[1:10:06] Fountain of spirit which had no
[1:10:08] beginning or no end this great spirit be
[1:10:10] to form in the creation and the logos
[1:10:13] that went out from it was the son of God
[1:10:17] it was the only visible form that the
[1:10:21] spirit had now you don't remember it and
[1:10:23] I don't remember it but if we will ever
[1:10:26] be a part of Christ Jesus the anointed
[1:10:29] word when when Christ went out of the
[1:10:33] invisible God right there you went out
[1:10:37] too you went out with him you died with
[1:10:41] him you raised with him and now you're
[1:10:44] sitting together with him in Heavenly
[1:10:46] places in Christ Jesus now we were word
[1:10:49] for him so every thought that God would
[1:10:52] ever had in time when out whenever he
[1:10:56] started forming this creation of himself
[1:10:59] and it was a theophany which means a
[1:11:03] body and the body was like a man so
[1:11:08] imagine then when God formed Adam in the
[1:11:11] Garden of Eden that where did he get the
[1:11:15] idea of of fingers hands ears nose eyes
[1:11:22] two legs why not give him four legs like
[1:11:25] like an animal why why give him hands
[1:11:28] that he could reach down and pick up why
[1:11:30] give him a soul why give him what don't
[1:11:33] make him just the highest form of animal
[1:11:35] life and leave him soulless and leave
[1:11:38] him without the ability to reach out to
[1:11:40] God and hunger and crave for God he
[1:11:42] would not been in the image of God
[1:11:44] because God had a craving too and that
[1:11:47] was for people of his own kind you see a
[1:11:51] human being in Search and some of our
[1:11:53] young people of the Church of course are
[1:11:55] at that age where they're looking for a
[1:11:57] companion and we just had a wedding this
[1:11:59] week and it turned out very beautiful
[1:12:01] and and every time that I look and see
[1:12:04] that I realize that there's that longing
[1:12:05] in the young woman that longing in the
[1:12:07] young man for a companion they may have
[1:12:10] all types of friends people that they're
[1:12:12] in contact with social media but yet
[1:12:14] there's something inside of them that
[1:12:16] they want a wife or a husband if it's a
[1:12:19] lady and it's more than just emailing
[1:12:22] them it's more than texting them that's
[1:12:24] a Wonder F communication thank God for
[1:12:26] it in the day that we have it but they
[1:12:28] want and I've said it over and over
[1:12:30] again I've been marrying people since I
[1:12:32] was 18 years old that's the first couple
[1:12:34] that I married when I was just a kid so
[1:12:36] you imagine I married a bunch of them
[1:12:37] over 50 years and I use the same
[1:12:40] ceremony which is the same one the
[1:12:42] prophet used and it said will you take
[1:12:44] this person to be your lawful wedded
[1:12:46] wife will you to have and to hold from
[1:12:50] this day forward for better for worse
[1:12:53] for richer for poor and sick nness and
[1:12:55] in hell to love to cherish until death
[1:12:59] do you part so it's not just to have but
[1:13:02] it's also to hold because there's
[1:13:05] something about love it wants to reach
[1:13:08] out to the other one and be able to
[1:13:10] touch them that's why it's so hard when
[1:13:12] a husband or wife will lose their
[1:13:14] companion in the Lord and his wisdom
[1:13:16] takes beyond the curtain of time and
[1:13:18] they no longer have that husband or wife
[1:13:21] that they can reach over and touch oh my
[1:13:23] goodness they know they're not woring
[1:13:25] wor about their soul they're not
[1:13:26] worrying about them not raising in the
[1:13:28] resurrection but they can no longer
[1:13:31] touch them and that love they had for
[1:13:33] them is still there in their heart and
[1:13:35] they just want to touch them to have and
[1:13:38] to hold where did we get that where did
[1:13:41] we get that God could have made the
[1:13:43] human being without that desire to touch
[1:13:46] but he made it oh Hallelujah within us
[1:13:49] to want that type of Fellowship not only
[1:13:53] with each other but also was
[1:13:56] him God wants to be touched he wants to
[1:14:00] be loved I don't know about you I long
[1:14:03] for the day when I'll be able to walk up
[1:14:04] to him and finally touch
[1:14:08] him oh Lord
[1:14:11] Jesus notice ohar that that son the
[1:14:14] logos became flesh because
[1:14:18] we were put in
[1:14:20] flesh so the logos the theophany was
[1:14:24] made flesh because we were put in flesh
[1:14:27] and the theophany the logos became flesh
[1:14:30] here among us and it was nothing else
[1:14:33] but the dwelling place for the entire
[1:14:36] fountain dwelt in him oh do you see it
[1:14:39] there it is there was the one you just
[1:14:43] take that Spirit of love the great
[1:14:45] Fountain of God pure
[1:14:48] unadulterated from that now watch how it
[1:14:51] comes down from the great source of this
[1:14:55] love now remember God is
[1:14:58] agape God is
[1:15:01] agape and then as it trickles down down
[1:15:05] to the human race watch how it can
[1:15:08] become from that it come into a
[1:15:11] perverted love then it come into a human
[1:15:14] love then it come into a sexual love
[1:15:18] then it come into other loves
[1:15:21] loves and loves and he keeps perverting
[1:15:26] down till it comes to just
[1:15:30] filth
[1:15:34] filth and this is where we are the
[1:15:36] farther we go the farther it comes from
[1:15:39] the Fountain of Purity and this is what
[1:15:42] makes us by the grace of God such a
[1:15:45] paradox for the age and time that we
[1:15:47] live in that in our souls our souls
[1:15:51] today are already recipients and we're
[1:15:55] standing right back in front of the
[1:15:57] fountain
[1:15:58] himself amen that we can love like
[1:16:05] God in other words you can pray for
[1:16:07] those who despitefully use you a real
[1:16:11] Holy Ghost Phil child of God does not
[1:16:14] look for a Time by which they can get
[1:16:17] revenge on someone who's hurt
[1:16:19] them praise the Lord now if you're that
[1:16:22] way today you need to go a little
[1:16:24] farther in the kingdom of God and the
[1:16:27] church said amen that's right now what
[1:16:31] so it keeps coming down and someday it
[1:16:34] will R wind right straight back to the
[1:16:39] original it's Eternal where lust human
[1:16:45] love passionate love all those
[1:16:49] loves will have to
[1:16:53] cease this is one thing that made the
[1:16:55] prophet so Marvel when he went beyond
[1:16:58] the curtain of
[1:17:00] time he had kept himself as a young man
[1:17:04] and would not hug on women or let women
[1:17:07] hug them
[1:17:09] him and when he goes beyond the curtain
[1:17:11] of time and these women start running to
[1:17:14] him and one after another after another
[1:17:16] is hugging him and hugging him he said
[1:17:18] anybody that knows me knows I would not
[1:17:22] allow that
[1:17:25] but the difference was he was looking at
[1:17:27] them and they were women in form and
[1:17:31] shape and he looked at himself and he
[1:17:35] was a man and he looked at the brothers
[1:17:38] as they come running to him and they
[1:17:41] were human
[1:17:43] looking human
[1:17:46] looking but they had laid aside human
[1:17:49] love sexual love is not allowed in the
[1:17:53] sixth dimension
[1:17:55] perverted love is not allowed in the
[1:17:58] sixth Dimension so this is one of the
[1:18:00] things that just overwhelmed him and he
[1:18:02] said that they touched me and they felt
[1:18:05] me and I I felt them but there was no
[1:18:08] human sensation there was no response
[1:18:11] there the way that it would normally be
[1:18:13] in a human life and he said I don't
[1:18:17] understand
[1:18:19] this oh Lord
[1:18:23] Jesus someday it'll wine right straight
[1:18:25] back to the original it's
[1:18:28] Eternal where lust human love passionate
[1:18:31] love all those loves will have to
[1:18:35] Cease the love for your lot wife is a
[1:18:38] FAL love the love for God is a gape Love
[1:18:44] A Million Miles higher every love not
[1:18:48] aapo love is perverted love which has an
[1:18:53] end
[1:18:55] and everything that has a beginning has
[1:18:57] an end and human
[1:19:00] love had a
[1:19:04] beginning don't you understand why you
[1:19:07] can never
[1:19:08] be a real consecrated
[1:19:12] Christian by S serving and loving
[1:19:16] God with your human
[1:19:19] love amen at your very
[1:19:22] best you're trying to to love God with a
[1:19:26] love which will cease to
[1:19:31] exist it will
[1:19:33] terminate that how could we love an
[1:19:36] eternal being with a time love or love
[1:19:41] that is so limited how can we love one
[1:19:44] another with a time love how it is it
[1:19:48] and you watch people as they give their
[1:19:50] heart to the Lord and as they go to
[1:19:52] serving the lord and you can watch them
[1:19:54] and see if they grow in their depths of
[1:19:57] love all my understanding is great yes
[1:19:59] been able to quote and and and quote
[1:20:01] scriptures and things like that awesome
[1:20:03] wonderful you ought to do that but God's
[1:20:07] Prophet said we need a Revival of
[1:20:11] Love Not Just theology amen now watch a
[1:20:17] human love had a beginning and it has it
[1:20:20] end all the Blessed Eternal God the love
[1:20:23] of God had no beginning and it'll never
[1:20:25] have an end when the oceans has wept
[1:20:30] themselves into the
[1:20:34] deserts now listen this is before the
[1:20:38] prophecy of Los Angeles this is 1958 in
[1:20:42] South Bend
[1:20:43] Indiana but he mentions it a few times
[1:20:45] in the message that one day the desert
[1:20:49] the oceans will weep its way into the
[1:20:53] desert we're on the brink of that
[1:20:55] destruction in the very age that we
[1:20:58] live when the oceans will weep
[1:21:01] themselves and the tsunamis and the
[1:21:03] tidal W or you say it's just the West
[1:21:05] Coast no it's not either when he stood
[1:21:08] down there in Florida in
[1:21:09] 1964 he said the same thing would happen
[1:21:12] again on the East
[1:21:14] Coast but remember the ocean will weep
[1:21:18] and cry why because of sin and filth
[1:21:24] on the Earth when the oceans has wept
[1:21:28] themselves into deserts and the world
[1:21:30] has got so full of sin till the heavens
[1:21:33] has turned its back on it and it
[1:21:36] staggers out through space like a drunk
[1:21:39] man coming
[1:21:41] home the love of God shall still
[1:21:45] endure Saints and Angels
[1:21:51] songen again he said do you ever think
[1:21:53] of that God the Great Master
[1:21:57] rainbow in the skies would say like that
[1:22:01] by the seven spirits of God now he takes
[1:22:05] the original Rainbow of God which is not
[1:22:08] six colors but
[1:22:10] seven and he breaks it down but to save
[1:22:13] time I won't go to all the colors today
[1:22:15] but he just mentions a couple here in
[1:22:17] this quote red being perfect
[1:22:21] love so the color of God's perfect
[1:22:24] perfect love in the rainbow is red why
[1:22:28] crimson color of
[1:22:30] redemption so out of this great Eternal
[1:22:34] issues forth this great bow this seven
[1:22:38] colored bow of God's covenant with the
[1:22:41] Earth and his people red perfect love
[1:22:45] after that comes felio love from an
[1:22:48] agapo to filo that's the love that you
[1:22:51] would have for your wife if some man
[1:22:54] would
[1:22:55] Suter you'd shoot his brains
[1:23:01] out wow see because it
[1:23:07] creates a
[1:23:09] jealousy but that's felio love secondary
[1:23:14] love then comes just for another man's
[1:23:19] wife now watch He's stepping it down the
[1:23:22] further down he comes to where we live
[1:23:24] every day so from the agape love it
[1:23:28] would be pure holy Timeless forgiving
[1:23:32] honest all that but then a man would
[1:23:36] love his wife and someone would insult
[1:23:38] or say something to her it be want to
[1:23:40] punch him or shoot his brains out as he
[1:23:42] said then that same man could actually
[1:23:47] fall in love with another man's
[1:23:53] wife now now what just happened to that
[1:23:55] man he stepped down from his love which
[1:23:59] was true and genuine he's willing to
[1:24:01] smack a man in the mouth he want to take
[1:24:03] his gun out and blow the man's brains
[1:24:05] out because he offended his wife but
[1:24:08] then right next to that love that you
[1:24:10] have for your
[1:24:11] wife is another love and all you have to
[1:24:14] do is step down one step further it's
[1:24:17] this close from real genuine F your love
[1:24:21] for your wife there's only one step
[1:24:23] that's right brother
[1:24:26] amen of you loving somebody else's
[1:24:31] wife and then one beneath that is you
[1:24:35] really get weird and you man fall in
[1:24:38] love with a
[1:24:40] man well come on now am it just keeps on
[1:24:43] going and going and
[1:24:47] going don't think you're immune today
[1:24:50] friends there's only one way we will not
[1:24:53] get caught up in these spirits of the
[1:24:56] last day we must love from the original
[1:25:00] Source you see it's not my
[1:25:03] responsibility to shame you all in
[1:25:05] living for God it's not my
[1:25:08] responsibility to hang you over hell
[1:25:10] every time we come to church and try to
[1:25:13] scare you into living for God I don't
[1:25:16] want to be that kind of a pastor I want
[1:25:19] to preach him so wonderful and so great
[1:25:23] and so good and so merciful oh come on
[1:25:26] let's have church today I want to preach
[1:25:28] him so wonderful that it will hopefully
[1:25:32] create a hunger in your heart to fall in
[1:25:35] love with such a mighty God and that you
[1:25:38] don't serve him because you're scared
[1:25:40] you're going to go to hell you serve him
[1:25:43] because you love him from your soul
[1:25:48] [Applause]
[1:25:54] oh my that's felio love secondary love
[1:25:58] then comes lust for another man's wife
[1:26:02] then comes filth it just becomes
[1:26:05] perverted but all of this kind of love
[1:26:09] had a beginning but when the real
[1:26:11] genuine love of God that I've been
[1:26:13] talking about comes into the human heart
[1:26:16] being by the new birth being born again
[1:26:20] it had no
[1:26:22] beginning it'll have no
[1:26:27] end you see there was a time you started
[1:26:31] loving
[1:26:35] God but there was never a
[1:26:38] time that he ever Started Loving
[1:26:41] You So how did you start from your fio
[1:26:45] aspect that's so many Christians are
[1:26:47] serving the lord today they love they
[1:26:49] say I love him I love him and I'm not
[1:26:52] saying that they don't but I'm just just
[1:26:54] saying was what love it's evident that
[1:26:57] many people through Christianity love
[1:26:59] and serve God from the fre of love
[1:27:01] because they will love him for a while
[1:27:04] and then they'll turn away and put a
[1:27:06] stop to their love and become an
[1:27:08] agnostic an Infidel an unbeliever well
[1:27:11] how in the world if they were loving God
[1:27:13] from the source of eternal love could
[1:27:15] you ever stop loving him and you stop
[1:27:18] serving him and you go back out into the
[1:27:21] world and start serving the devil that
[1:27:23] makes absolute no sense but if you can
[1:27:26] ever be born again from this essence of
[1:27:29] eternal love and actually what God does
[1:27:31] is give you that part of himself that
[1:27:36] can love him back the way he wants to be
[1:27:38] loved you see I don't know how to love
[1:27:41] him you don't know how to love him how
[1:27:42] don't how much you think you do you
[1:27:44] don't we do not know how to love him
[1:27:47] right I cannot love him right with my
[1:27:50] FAL love the only way I can love him is
[1:27:54] he gives me a deposit of himself and
[1:27:57] quickens that love within me within you
[1:28:01] and then it's him out of my body loving
[1:28:05] him back so it's the source that's been
[1:28:09] resourced it's the source that's what
[1:28:11] the Holy Ghost does that God sends down
[1:28:15] the resource of his own love and our
[1:28:17] soul and it's him in US worshiping him
[1:28:22] loving him
[1:28:27] oh my let's give him a hand of Praise
[1:28:30] what an awesome
[1:28:35] plan oh
[1:28:37] my it comes into the human being by the
[1:28:40] new births being born again it had no
[1:28:42] beginning it'll have no end you then are
[1:28:45] a son of God and a daughter of God your
[1:28:49] affections are on things above now you
[1:28:53] find in the church that what hindered
[1:28:55] the
[1:28:55] church has been the wrong
[1:28:58] conception of
[1:29:01] love there's two different types of love
[1:29:04] that's real love one of them in the
[1:29:07] Greek word is called agapo that's God's
[1:29:09] love then a perverted love from that is
[1:29:13] felo love which means human love felio
[1:29:17] comes from the word
[1:29:19] Fellowship the fal love is what you have
[1:29:22] for your wife and a might flirt with her
[1:29:25] and Sal her and you'd shoot his brains
[1:29:27] out over her that's what filo love will
[1:29:30] do it
[1:29:32] accompanies jealousy
[1:29:35] oh and many other things goes with
[1:29:40] it and the church said amen have many
[1:29:44] has ever been jealous before
[1:29:48] amen come on inch it on up
[1:29:51] there had enmity and strive
[1:29:55] that's my wife that's my son or daughter
[1:29:57] I can't believe them deacons told my son
[1:29:59] I'll tell you one thing
[1:30:02] I
[1:30:04] filo but the spirit of God is always
[1:30:07] subject to God's
[1:30:08] teaching amen
[1:30:12] right now watch what it would do but
[1:30:14] agape love would make
[1:30:19] you
[1:30:21] pray for his sinful soul
[1:30:26] thank now man could agape love his his
[1:30:30] God from his soul and filio love his
[1:30:35] wife his children all of that but even
[1:30:39] in that we don't want to just felo love
[1:30:42] our wife and our church family and our
[1:30:44] Earthly family we want to agape love
[1:30:47] them you see that's the key of why he
[1:30:49] tells us that when a man meets a woman
[1:30:51] and he loves her and he don't know why
[1:30:54] and she meets a man and she loves him
[1:30:57] and she don't know why but they just
[1:30:59] love one
[1:31:01] another that's an eternal mate that
[1:31:05] stepped out of Eternity and one day into
[1:31:08] a body of time and one day they will
[1:31:09] step back into eternity
[1:31:12] again I love my my wife with
[1:31:17] felio but I also love her with
[1:31:21] agapo in eternity
[1:31:25] she will be mine I will be hers there
[1:31:28] will be no more children I will not look
[1:31:30] at her as I did when she was a young
[1:31:33] girl and say oh my goodness and my heart
[1:31:36] started racing oh that's the prettiest
[1:31:38] thing I ever seen in my life I still
[1:31:40] think she's quite pretty be honest with
[1:31:42] you right now but you know and in that
[1:31:45] all of that part will be totally gone
[1:31:47] and we will look at each other totally
[1:31:50] different so the things that we dislike
[1:31:52] about people we go to church now I'm
[1:31:54] going to come over and S on this side of
[1:31:55] the pen and hunker down just in case
[1:31:57] anybody wants to throw a song book at me
[1:31:59] in this part right here there's people
[1:32:01] we go to church with that we just don't
[1:32:02] like things about
[1:32:08] them maybe even the preacher you sitting
[1:32:10] under things you don't like about him
[1:32:11] too well believe me that works both
[1:32:16] ways but you understand that when we get
[1:32:19] rid of fol love
[1:32:24] that goes with
[1:32:26] it amen
[1:32:29] than there's no jealousy there's no
[1:32:31] Strife there's no Envy now we're loving
[1:32:34] from a mixed
[1:32:35] bag so we pour from felo we pour from
[1:32:39] aape we pour from these
[1:32:43] sources oh
[1:32:47] Jesus but a gab love would make you pray
[1:32:50] for your sinful Soul that's the
[1:32:52] difference between the two loves
[1:32:54] God's love is the beginning of love it's
[1:32:57] the Fountain of love and the church
[1:33:00] today is lacking in
[1:33:02] that can we say Amen can we say God I
[1:33:06] need
[1:33:08] help that real agape
[1:33:12] love that makes you have love won't you
[1:33:16] notice how he keeps using this same verb
[1:33:18] over and over again it actually makes
[1:33:22] you
[1:33:28] have love for your
[1:33:31] enemy I'm trying I'm trying I figure
[1:33:34] that's the problem many of us are trying
[1:33:37] our best to love our enemies from the
[1:33:40] wrong Avenue and the wrong source of
[1:33:42] love and this is why we're failing
[1:33:45] you're trying to tap into FAL human life
[1:33:49] and I don't like them and I reckon I got
[1:33:51] to if I'm want to go to heaven and I
[1:33:52] want to go to hell
[1:33:55] Hallelujah brother Rob I'm going to love
[1:33:57] you buddy I want to love you I really
[1:34:01] don't want to but I'll tell you one time
[1:34:02] I'm going to love you brother
[1:34:05] Paul but if I ever get God's love that's
[1:34:10] right it makes
[1:34:13] me so from within my soul is a Dynamo
[1:34:17] that I have actually broke back into
[1:34:20] eternity and it's like that Dynamo
[1:34:22] that's just spinning around and it spins
[1:34:24] around in my soul and my my human love
[1:34:27] may look at and say oh he talked about
[1:34:29] me he run me down he said this that and
[1:34:31] other but the Dynamo just overpowers it
[1:34:34] and just brings you on you say but Lord
[1:34:36] Jesus I forgive my
[1:34:39] brother amen maybe he's having a bad
[1:34:43] day maybe he's having a hard
[1:34:46] time and then when I come to myself I'm
[1:34:49] just thinking oh Lord did I say that oh
[1:34:53] I realize all of y'all are angels here
[1:34:55] today except for me and I reckon I'm the
[1:34:57] only one holding up the Rapture right
[1:34:59] God sent this whole Sermon Just for me
[1:35:01] well I don't think so because looks like
[1:35:02] to me if I was the main problem he could
[1:35:04] have told me down in the basement where
[1:35:06] I studied and eliminated you all of all
[1:35:08] this whooping I figure y'all as guilty
[1:35:10] as I am I figure you know this is a
[1:35:13] reason that we've not already gone in
[1:35:15] the Rapture is because we're not Rapture
[1:35:21] Ready thank you Lord
[1:35:25] oh if we only had that kind of a love
[1:35:29] there'd be a Revival sweep this nation
[1:35:31] from coast to coast from north to south
[1:35:34] and the reason we do not have that love
[1:35:37] this is the main reason the church is
[1:35:40] not
[1:35:42] progressing like it should we don't need
[1:35:46] theology we only need real
[1:35:48] love to go with a theology we already
[1:35:52] know
[1:35:54] When
[1:35:56] Love
[1:35:58] is
[1:36:00] projected and it comes to its end
[1:36:03] friends I believe with all of my
[1:36:07] heart love has been projected for seven
[1:36:10] Church
[1:36:12] ages and we're right down here close to
[1:36:14] the end when the projected love to call
[1:36:18] a bride out of seven Church ages is
[1:36:21] almost right there at its very end
[1:36:24] and when love is projected it comes to
[1:36:27] its end Sovereign Grace produces what
[1:36:34] love
[1:36:36] projected you understand where we are
[1:36:39] here we are the time is taken away here
[1:36:42] we are the closing of the Gentile ages
[1:36:45] and love was projected thousands of
[1:36:48] years ago there will be a bride I'll
[1:36:50] call her out the seven bands of Life
[1:36:52] I'll call her out under the dispensation
[1:36:54] of these seven Church ages and seven
[1:36:56] Church age Messengers and here they are
[1:36:59] almost at the end and God says my love
[1:37:02] projected it yeah yes sir oh scientists
[1:37:06] are talking about 2050 and 2065 and 2075
[1:37:11] I just life when I read all that stuff I
[1:37:13] think you guys need to wake up we're
[1:37:15] right at the end it was three minutes
[1:37:16] till midnight back in the 60s we're only
[1:37:19] seconds away now don't you understand
[1:37:22] what God's going to do love projected a
[1:37:24] bride and Grace will step in yes it will
[1:37:29] and what will the headstone be crying
[1:37:32] when it comes Grace Grace Grace So
[1:37:38] Divine love projected it and God's grace
[1:37:42] will come in and bring it to its
[1:37:50] end love projected Sovereign Grace
[1:37:55] that gave us a
[1:37:56] savior so then in order for us to be
[1:37:59] able to love this way we looked at it
[1:38:02] last Sunday but second Peter 1:4 whereby
[1:38:04] are given unto us exceeding great and
[1:38:06] precious promises that by these you
[1:38:08] might be partakers of the divine nature
[1:38:12] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:38:15] the world through lust no wait minute I
[1:38:17] thought it was an
[1:38:19] apple I thought it was an apricot what
[1:38:22] in the world was Peter saying corruption
[1:38:24] entered into the world through
[1:38:27] lust don't you understand as long as Eve
[1:38:29] was inside of Adam she could never
[1:38:32] experience lust but it's when God pulled
[1:38:36] her out of Adam Adam could have never
[1:38:39] fallen had he stayed in the spirit
[1:38:42] image Hallelujah God made three great
[1:38:46] men Genesis 1 Genesis 2 and the promise
[1:38:50] of the great one in Genesis 3 and Adam
[1:38:53] was a spirit man then he become a flesh
[1:38:56] man and when he fell God projected by
[1:38:58] prophetic word I will bring you back who
[1:39:02] was that Christ Jesus then here come the
[1:39:05] pre-existing one the almighty one
[1:39:08] himself and he said I will bring love
[1:39:12] back to man's heart I will make man to
[1:39:15] be a lover again I will restore him back
[1:39:19] to
[1:39:21] fellowship thank you Lord
[1:39:25] Oh Oh Glory to God I thought of how
[1:39:31] God of the dove such a loving bird and
[1:39:34] the dove God wanting to make love with
[1:39:37] his human
[1:39:39] beings God wants to be loved and God
[1:39:42] wants to love you and God so loved the
[1:39:44] world that he gave his only begotten son
[1:39:47] the whosoever believeth in him should
[1:39:48] not perish but have everlasting life
[1:39:50] blessed be the Lord then go God wanting
[1:39:54] to make
[1:39:55] love he had to make something
[1:40:00] lovable he had to make something gentle
[1:40:04] like himself he had to make something
[1:40:07] that could be loved he had to make
[1:40:08] something of his own
[1:40:12] nature you couldn't love nothing that
[1:40:14] wasn't of your own
[1:40:18] nature another differentiation between
[1:40:21] the church and the bride
[1:40:26] God wants to make love to his people he
[1:40:31] wants to Fellowship talk to them that's
[1:40:34] why it's so important that you pray over
[1:40:36] the person you
[1:40:37] marry that you're marrying of the right
[1:40:40] nature nature of the word I mean so God
[1:40:44] wants to talk to the church and God will
[1:40:47] test them by his
[1:40:49] word so God will anoint a preacher to go
[1:40:53] have talked unto them about
[1:40:56] election and they'll say we don't
[1:40:58] believe in election oh we don't believe
[1:41:01] in
[1:41:02] predestination we don't want to know
[1:41:03] that predestinated seedset well you see
[1:41:05] what you're doing is you're showing that
[1:41:07] as of yet you've not been made into his
[1:41:10] nature cuz God is a god of sovereignty
[1:41:13] and he wants to talk to his wife about
[1:41:16] how Sovereign he is he wants to talk to
[1:41:18] his wife about how great he is are you
[1:41:21] hearing me he wants to talk to wife when
[1:41:23] they're going through the offest trial
[1:41:25] they've ever been through in their life
[1:41:27] and he wants to talk to his his wife and
[1:41:29] convince her that he's still in control
[1:41:32] but many people that do not love your I
[1:41:34] oh how in the world would you let this
[1:41:35] happen to me you're supposed to be a god
[1:41:37] of love you're supposed to be a god of
[1:41:38] Mercy why why would you let that happen
[1:41:40] well you see they're not of his nature
[1:41:42] yet but once they become of his nature
[1:41:45] in their pain in their Agony in their
[1:41:48] sorrow they can say you are perfect you
[1:41:51] make no mistakes you do nothing wrong
[1:41:55] don't you see he must allow us to be
[1:41:58] tested in such a way to prove that our
[1:42:01] nature matches his own
[1:42:07] sovereignty thank you
[1:42:12] Lord so what do people who love him from
[1:42:16] felo they
[1:42:18] rebel I they know way I'd serve a God
[1:42:21] Like That
[1:42:23] my church Don't Preach it that way right
[1:42:26] come on well they go to talk tell them
[1:42:27] about Malachi for what Mal Prophet stuff
[1:42:31] well days of prophets has
[1:42:34] passed he's looking for someone that he
[1:42:37] can talk
[1:42:39] to oh I love it after church me and
[1:42:43] Carol will go
[1:42:45] home and we'll we'll talk about the
[1:42:47] words sometimes after Sunday Sunday
[1:42:49] evening then Monday again and Tuesday
[1:42:52] it's just it's our life we just love the
[1:42:53] Lord and we talk about the word and just
[1:42:55] get together you imagine then God want
[1:42:57] to talk to the church about his word the
[1:42:59] church we don't believe that in our
[1:43:01] church our Pastor said that was a
[1:43:05] cult our denomination strictly forbids
[1:43:08] us from shouting and
[1:43:10] dancing but they'll allow you to go to a
[1:43:13] party and shout and
[1:43:14] dance well come on the original dance
[1:43:16] belongs in church not at a party well
[1:43:20] praise the Lord our church don't believe
[1:43:22] in speak speak in Tong our church don't
[1:43:24] believe that God is a god of Miracles
[1:43:26] well you need to get saved you need to
[1:43:28] tap into that real genuine love of God
[1:43:31] if God wants to talk to us today about
[1:43:33] miracles I'll answer back amen Lord if
[1:43:38] the Lord wants to talk to us about his
[1:43:40] sovereignty I'm going to sit in his lap
[1:43:42] come on somebody I'm going to sit there
[1:43:44] and say oh papa how great you are how
[1:43:47] Mighty you are how wonderful you are I
[1:43:49] wasn't always of that nature but once I
[1:43:53] got born again of the word of God for
[1:43:56] the hour if papa wants to talk to me
[1:43:59] about Grace I'll say Amen Papa he wants
[1:44:02] to talk to me about predestination I'll
[1:44:04] say Amen Papa I had you in my mind
[1:44:08] before the world began I'll say Amen
[1:44:12] Papa
[1:44:14] why I'm of his
[1:44:18] nature so if he wants to talk to me
[1:44:20] about the Divine architect
[1:44:23] with a Divine bought attribute with a
[1:44:27] divine plan with a Divine this and a
[1:44:30] Divine that I just sat there with my
[1:44:33] eyes looking at him cooling
[1:44:36] back he can make love to
[1:44:39] me cuz his nature and mine
[1:44:44] listen are the
[1:44:49] [Laughter]
[1:44:51] same and that you too if you're born
[1:44:56] again so he tries to tell them about how
[1:44:59] they should
[1:45:00] dress what difference does that make he
[1:45:03] tries to tell them you can't walk that
[1:45:05] road sisters with them spy kill shoes
[1:45:10] on oh that don't
[1:45:13] matter oh you can't walk that Ro and
[1:45:15] make that
[1:45:19] P and so you think God is going to take
[1:45:21] a woman like that into eternity and
[1:45:24] spend eternity with a woman which Rebels
[1:45:29] against his
[1:45:33] word now nobody has to make a peep from
[1:45:36] this point on but there's probably some
[1:45:38] of you maybe feel like you've been
[1:45:39] married to somebody for eternity and you
[1:45:41] think Lord have mercy help me
[1:45:43] Jesus that's okay everybody look down
[1:45:45] everybody look up just close your eyes
[1:45:47] or whatever so you won't be a dead
[1:45:49] giveaway can you imagine the Lord Jesus
[1:45:52] taking a people in this earth they don't
[1:45:54] believe in predestination they don't
[1:45:55] believe in election they don't believe
[1:45:57] in a prophet's message they don't even
[1:45:58] believe in church agents they don't
[1:45:59] believe in none of that stuff they don't
[1:46:00] believe in Holiness and he's going to
[1:46:02] live with eternity with that loud mouth
[1:46:04] BR woman sir brother
[1:46:10] amen
[1:46:15] oh let's
[1:46:18] close there isn't nothing else that you
[1:46:20] can do only believe
[1:46:23] and if he believes in them little
[1:46:25] immoral things would
[1:46:28] just drop
[1:46:32] off as you believe you become
[1:46:37] love and love is
[1:46:40] God and you begin to wind
[1:46:43] yourself
[1:46:45] into Christ these other things you don't
[1:46:48] have to quit doing them they just quit
[1:46:50] themselves there's just no desire to do
[1:46:53] it the worshipper having been purged in
[1:46:56] a more conscious desire of sin Hebrews 9
[1:46:59] see when the worshipper is purged when
[1:47:01] he's born again when his old nature dies
[1:47:03] and a new nature sits in then becomes a
[1:47:05] part of God a Son of God it gets new
[1:47:09] life and the life is the Greek word
[1:47:11] there zoi which means the life of God
[1:47:13] then you become an offspring of God and
[1:47:15] God cannot hurt you without
[1:47:19] hurting himself
[1:47:25] hallelujah it's your
[1:47:28] right if you are part of the elect of
[1:47:31] God it's a god-given
[1:47:34] right for you to have the

[1:52:53] I I need I need that more in my heart
[1:52:55] father would you just raise your hand to
[1:52:58] him maybe somebody got an answer that
[1:53:00] you've been searching for for years of
[1:53:01] your
[1:53:03] life and you find yourself struggling to
[1:53:05] love those that have hurt you so
[1:53:08] deeply and so
[1:53:12] severely and you in and out and up and
[1:53:14] down with it resentment bitterness
[1:53:17] friends I'm telling you it'll grieve the
[1:53:19] spirit of God out of your life
[1:53:23] listen to me as your brother as your
[1:53:24] pastor you let bitterness grow up inside
[1:53:27] of you it will grieve the Holy Spirit
[1:53:30] right out of your life you think you're
[1:53:33] hurting them by being bitter toward them
[1:53:35] you're hurting yourself more than anyone
[1:53:38] else then it'll come into your family
[1:53:41] and it'll outgrow itself into others and
[1:53:44] others and keep on
[1:53:45] going but brother Donnie it's hard tell
[1:53:48] me about it I know it's hard but when we
[1:53:52] can so Soul fall in love with Jesus
[1:53:54] Christ and let his love live out of us
[1:53:58] we can love our enemies we can pray for
[1:54:01] them how may like to be remembered today

[1:54:15] prayer now we're going to close it in
[1:54:19] prayer I had the advantage over them and
[1:54:22] and that I knew the direction that you'd
[1:54:24] placed upon my heart but now Lord we all
[1:54:27] stand on the same plane as it
[1:54:29] were all of us checking our hearts and
[1:54:32] our lives and seeing where we

[2:04:01] feelings and you know how we are as
[2:04:03] humans depending on our makeup for some
[2:04:05] people it can be such a struggle to be
[2:04:08] able to forgive those that have brought
[2:04:09] some terrible pain to them or their
[2:04:11] family but Lord Jesus within ourselves
[2:04:14] may we be able to confess it God I can't

[2:04:47] more miracles and and so on and we want
[2:04:50] that too Lord yes we do but oh Lord I'm
[2:04:54] finding out more and more why the
[2:04:56] prophet said that he would rather have
[2:04:59] love than all the gifts there was in the
[2:05:02] Bible no doubt if we had the right kind
[2:05:05] of love than the gifts we got would be
[2:05:08] operated in the right kind of way Lord
[2:05:11] Jesus would you send a Revival to Word
[2:05:14] of Life
[2:05:16] Church oh that we not only love our
[2:05:18] enemies but we love one another May the

[2:05:43] Jesus we love you Lord what we've seen
[2:05:45] here in the last couple of months since
[2:05:48] that hurricane came through I told
[2:05:50] several people it's given me hope for
[2:05:52] Humanity to see people reaching out and
[2:05:55] helping people that don't even know and
[2:05:58] Lord God what a world it will be one day
[2:06:01] when there'll be no more hurricanes and
[2:06:02] no more storms there'll never be one
[2:06:05] argument in the streets of gold there
[2:06:07] never be one disagreement nobody will
[2:06:10] ever run and hide their face from
[2:06:12] someone else they don't like there'll be
[2:06:14] nothing like that oh Lord God I I'm
[2:06:17] reminded of the words of your Prophet
[2:06:19] that he tells us in streetport when he
[2:06:21] was talking about being beyond the
[2:06:23] curtain of time and he said I believe
[2:06:24] the people who go in the Rapture will be
[2:06:27] something like that before they leave oh
[2:06:30] Grant it to our assembly Lord Jesus help
[2:06:33] me as the pastor father that I will not
[2:06:36] only lead from the theological point of
[2:06:38] view but help me to lead and to guide
