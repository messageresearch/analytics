[0:00] Oh God for we are despised and turned
[0:06] the reproach upon their own head and
[0:09] give them for a prey in the land of
[0:12] captivity and cover not their iniquity
[0:16] and let not their sin be blotted out
[0:18] from them before thee but they have
[0:19] provoked thee to anger before the
[0:23] builders now when we first opened up
[0:29] chapter 4 beginning with verse 1 it was
[0:32] sand the last and Tobias at was mad now
[0:35] we got God mad I dread the day with 385
[0:41] billion nine hundred and seventy four
[0:43] thousand three hundred and thirty-two
[0:44] mad samba laughs and one mad dog so
[0:53] listen what they got so we decided that
[0:56] we would stay home and we would not go
[0:59] back to church again because it was too
[1:01] many hypocrites we decided we would go
[1:04] to Walmart and buy everybody a pair of
[1:06] shorts and we would buy makeup and we
[1:09] buy little beer as well and we just live
[1:11] the life of Riley so built we
[1:22] criticism never slowed them down really
[1:25] kill never slowed them down they made
[1:27] fun of never slowed them there they kept
[1:30] right on building the law that all fears
[1:34] never slow them down
[1:35] the failures of their fathers never
[1:37] slowed them down their own questions and
[1:40] their minds never slowed them down
[1:43] [Applause]
