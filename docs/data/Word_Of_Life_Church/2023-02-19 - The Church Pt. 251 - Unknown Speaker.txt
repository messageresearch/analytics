it someday for us [Applause] won't that be an awesome time let's turn today if you would to the book of Philemon a little small book in the New Testament book of Philemon so grateful we can be together again today in the presence of the Lord and he comes with a need on your heart your life before the Lord I believe he's mindful of all of them don't we this is a very very small book as far as chapters and verses but it's a very powerful book and what it contains for the lives of God's children Philemon verse 5. hearing of thy love and faith which thou Hast toward the lord Jesus and toward All Saints you see someone who really loves the Lord Jesus right loves his people amen people who say they love God and don't love his people they don't really know the love of God yet now notice in verse 6. that the communication of thy faith may become effectual that the communication of thy faith how do you communicate Faith now notice he says that the communication of thy faith may become effectual this was a great Christian love the Lord but there was some more that this brother needed and that was that his faiths might become more factual to become communicative the word effectual means powerful active energetic and perfected and full knowledge that the communication of thy faith may become effectual now listen how it's going to happen raising the Dead Brother Donny walking on the water casting out Devils Healing The Sick well that's not what Paul told this brother may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus you mean that's one of the ways that our own faith becomes more energetic how many believes in the Lord how many believes in God believes there's a heaven believes there's a hell of course of course we all believe that that's why you're here today but we desire that our faith will be more energetic do we not that it'll produce what God's word says notice in verse 7 for we have great joy and consolation in thy love because the bowels of the Saints are refreshed by thee brother wow what a child of God so the way the Hebrews looked at it the bowels mean of course something totally different to us but to them it was the seat of the passions it was something there within you that you couldn't describe now once you notice here that verse 7 shows us that this brother Philemon was a refreshing Christian and the kind of man that others appreciated how many wants to be that today just a refreshing Christian sort of like you've been out in the heart and you've been working and sweating and you are so tired and you're just exhausted and somebody goes to bring you your favorite drink whatever that is whether it's hot or cold to you but yet it's just so refreshes you this is what God wants his people to be refreshing Christians you know the church at coloss actually met at the home of this brother Philemon and his wife afia now this is where that the church was held Philippians chapter 4 verse 8. finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are on us whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are good report it's there being a virtue if there be any praise think on these things and the church said we're going to pray but before we do um brother Phil and sister Ruth's priests maybe you probably know that their son a little newborn son Jonah has pneumonia in one lung and the other little boy Micah has a fever and a rash so he's right to the level as far as having to go on breathing and all of that so it's it's a serious thing for sure we want to remember them today also with a little bit of sadness in our hearts I wanted to just say this that our precious Susan mate that's been with us for so many months is heading back home to Kenya and we just wanted to say how much we love you sister says we're going to miss you she's been here for about six months I believe something like that I've known these folks for years and years and years in my trips to to Kenya and they've always been so special to me may God bless you Sister I made a lot to be remembered today you have a need a request on your heart I'm sure all of us do heavenly father as we bow our heads to the dust of the earth and once we were taken and unless the change comes we will all go back that same way but while we are here we certainly desire to be the type of people you want us to be for most of us that are here today in this building we are not here to become Christians we're not here to become Believers we are not here many of us to receive the Holy Ghost we are not here to find eternal life but we are here to learn how we can be a better people a people that are truly as Paul said about this precious brother of ours effectual people that are contagious people that when others get around us they want to be around us more I pray that you would help us with that father in the name of Jesus would you minister to those that are sick and needy father little Jonah in the name of Jesus May the spirit of God go into the hospital where that little baby is today Satan I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ leave this child father our brother Mike Pinkston and the hospital still we're praying for your mercy to him help him Lord my daughter Alicia is still not feeling well today Father prayer that should move for her others that are sick and needy touch your people speak to us as only you can do in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated I don't believe our lord Jesus could have completely fulfilled a journey on the Earth in the act of canosis which is the emptying out of himself Forum a greater purpose than what he felt like keeping himself and that realm was that may be overwhelming to us but he felt the purpose of emptying himself out would be greater than staying that way and he did it of course for us truly he could not have died in the logos form he could not have become sin on a tree in that form of the word so there's only one way he could do it and that was to empty himself into another form by that there was much that he laid aside and he took on something that he had never had before and that was total Humanity he appeared in various times in the Old Testament in different forms a cloud a fire a light a theophany different ways but he had never taken on a permanent flesh body and he didn't want to just take on a permanent flesh body that was in a glorified state but he must first go through the human side which is the great side of weakness then glorify that body and then make a way to bring others in that same pattern we know that he suffered in his body sickness and disease and all different types of things like that but for myself looking at the condensation that he stepped into I cannot believe that he would have done all of that and never stepped into the part that most of us deal with every day and that is so much negativity in our lives we're born that way we're born negative we're born with all types of sad things that's going to happen to us in our life some of you teenagers have already experienced more in your life than some have at 50 60 70 years old because of the trauma the sadness maybe divorce in your home maybe someone with a a very very bad disease and you you're having to experience that in your life I just cannot believe that our Lord would have felt that he completed the journey to the Earth without himself experienced a lot of negative things by that I don't mean that he himself was negative but that he allowed a lot of negative things to come to him and as I was thinking this morning wondering about our Lord and how that he constantly was saying I am this and I am that I am the way I am the truth I am this and I am that I came from God and I begin to think and look at it in a little bit different way than I'd ever looked at it before because I know that he was saying that that it would be written in the word and that Generations would be able to read that and know who he was but it began to wonder as I was thinking about it this morning if part of that acknowledgment was not for himself that he would be able to keep before him who he was and what he was here for did he say it for us no doubt he did but he was the very author of Faith so he would truly know how important it is to say what the word says about you now truly the Bible doesn't give us a lot of examples of Jesus going through a lot of negative things we know that he was he was born under the Roman times and he was persecuted from the born the day that he was born into the day that he died and we know that he dealt with a lot of things around him by the people that were around him hardly nobody knew who he was even the disciples who knew they got it so slowly no doubt he dealt with so much negative things even from the people he had chosen to be around him they argued they fussed they debate wanted to know who's going to be the greatest who's going to have the biggest Ministry all that sort of thing and that was certainly a negative aspect that the Lord Jesus never had to dealt with himself there was no one greater than him and yet no one could come as low as he came so he never dealt with that but he must have allowed himself to feel that feeling of what it's like to be negative to be sad as a matter of fact the prophet Isaiah told us that he was oppressed and that word means depression so he must have felt this this element of depression by what that he was a sinner no he wasn't that because he'd messed up terribly he never messed up one time he never said one wrong word never thought one thought from a sinful nature because he didn't have a sinful nature so wonder why he got oppressed wonder why he felt sad wonder why that he felt as if though he needed the word to encourage him well they could only be from the world that he was living in and the people that he was around because it never generated from himself unlike you and I we don't have to be around too many negative people oh we got to be around is ourself and we get just enough negativity from ourself I don't need none of yours in reality you don't need none of mine but yet because we're all born in this and it's what the prophet called The Law of contrast and we know under the law of contrast it takes both positive and negative to make it work one day thank God the law of contrast shall be annihilated and will no longer need that but yet under the law of contrast which is all we've ever known the Lord God allowed himself to be subject not only to the law of sickness and the law of death and the law of suffering and the law of persecution but he also allowed himself to be born under the law of contrast all he'd ever known was the positive side all they'd ever known was the goodness and the mercy and the gentleness and all that was good about God so he allowed himself to experience what Mortals would experience being born under this law of contrast which is great negativity so so we would think negative and a lot of you are probably like me and most every other human on the earth that whenever we go to hear some bad news most of us many times will always make it worse than what it really is now wonder who taught us how to do that who taught us how to exaggerate in a negative way who taught us to think the worst about circumstances who taught us to think the worst about people who told us to think the worst about people that we even go to church with people that we love even Tom family members sometimes and someone will tell you I've got something to tell you oh I've got something to tell you why is it that most of us will always go toward it's bad I know it's awful it's absolutely terrible she's fail in adultery oh no he's around off of somebody else's wife oh no they've done this and they tell you to say I know it was nothing bad at all it was actually good I got a raise at my job and they cut my hours back four hours on the day ain't that wonderful but why is it we think more negative than we do positive now for the Lord Jesus to be able to understand and be the high priest of our souls he himself would you agree he himself would had to experience this element of being negative or at least battling and allow his human nature to feel it that way now the Old Testament of course covers this quite well uh in a different way than than the aspect of the new so let us read a few scriptures if you will this morning in Psalms 19 14. let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight O Lord my strengths and my redeemer now David of course knew that he himself had been born a sinner never able to be reborn the way we are but he saw that there was a power in the word now remember he didn't even have the New Testament he did not have these beloved scriptures in Saint John 15 7. if you abide me and my words abide in you ask what you will he didn't have many of these positive things that God has given us so what did he have the Ten Commandments and he had the Torah which was made up basically of Thou shalt not Thou shalt not Thou shalt not Thou shalt not Thou shalt not Thou shalt not and yet he said he loved that more than he loved his necessary food can you imagine how he had cut up if he'd been in the New Testament when most of the Old Testament or the Torah anyway was negative so don't do this and don't do that if you do it I'm going to get you if you mess up I'm going to punish you if you mess up I'm going to take out the good lamb and David loved that part of the word my goodness if he would have said in Word of Life today the deacons are done escorted him out because a man wouldn't been able to contain himself now notice again in Psalms 141 3 set a watch O Lord before my mouth set a watch O Lord before my mouth how many needs to watch before yours said a watch O Lord before my mouth keep the door of my lips now right here is the biggest door in your life out of that door comes much of our own difficulty it comes much of our own issues and much of our own problems y'all going to preach women now this morning keep the door off before my mouth keep the door of my lips so David takes the lips as if though they are the entrance or the exit by which good things come out or bad things come out again Proverbs 6 2 Solomon wrote it this way thou art snared with the words of thy mouth Thou Art taken now what he's doing he's using the words of a Fowler or a hunter one that would lay a snare or would lay a trap and then they would put something in there so depending on what you were doing if it was an animal that you would after you would take a bird and you would tie a wing or something like that and the bird would lay there and flop and flop and he couldn't get out because he was tired so uh caracala Jackal whatever it was would hear it and see it and it would be screaming screaming screaming and it was just absolutely baiting itself so out of this Bird's mouth would come distress and cries for mercy and the caracal or the The Jackal what it was would hear it and it would hear it get closer closer it would spot it it would watch it now what's it doing actually the hunter was the one who put that in there and he's going to bait the Trap so David's liking our Mouse uh in the same way that Solomon did that our mouths can be a snare or our Mouse can be a trap that will entrap our lives of what God wants us to be and can so affect us that we don't become effectual in the promise of his word God help us Thou Art snare with the words of thy mouth Thou Art taken with the words of thy mouth so we'll set this way then that a jackal comes real close and there's a rabbit inside of there and the hunter has placed the rabbit tied its leg to a stake The Jackal cannot see the the Rope of course and the little rabbit is pulling pulling pulling and if you ever heard one they make one of the most pitiful screams it's it's terrible to hear it and it's a scream of pain and Agony and it will come in there when it does it totally overlooks the snare which has been laid not for the rabbit that has been laid for the caracal or for the Jackal or whatever more and he will come in precautiously nervously and when he steps his foot the hunter is laid a leaf or a brown something on the top of that to hide it but he must step into that in order to get the rabbit he must step into that in order to get the bird and here he comes laid right in his path and he's walking so carefully and he puts one foot on it and when he does he sets the trap now he saw it he was going after something to eat but you see there was a mine which was more intelligent than his own that had laid a snare for him that something that appealed to him well the devil lays many snares for us now I know some of y'all are thinking well that's pornography and some of you are thinking well it's smoking or it's drinking and sometimes it can be that way but many times it's this thing right here everybody's got one I reckon this morning don't they you need to watch that thing because it'll get you into more trouble than you can get out of I'm telling you that right now so it becomes a snare if we allow it to be so now it doesn't have to be but notice again Proverbs 13 3 he that keepeth his mouth keep us his life he that keepeth his mouths keep us his life but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction now you can imagine if David and Solomon would have known about Facebook and Instagram and Tick Tock and all the rest of the things that we have in this day Lord have mercy they would have committed chapter after chapter after chapter to all this stuff notice again Proverbs 15 4 a wholesome tongue a wholesome tongue look at the word wholesome healths and healing so a wholesome tongue is a tree of life but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit a wholesome tongue is a tree of life now I wonder how many of us have got Briars and brambles in our tongue instead of a tree of life well I'm no good I'm no count I'm not acceptable nobody loves me God will never do nothing for me you need to get that out of your mouth friends you need to replace that with a wholesome tree bear with me a little bit and we'll get to the good part in a bit now notice again in Proverbs 18 21 deaths and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof so death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof Matthew 12 37 for by thy words Thou shalt be justified and by thy words Thou shalt be condemned now remember the Lord Jesus was not born the way we were so naturally it comes to us to do this it it we just tend to be that way we're more prone to be negative than we are positive now you can read all the self-help books that you want you can go to the library and check them all out you can go to Amazon and you can do whatever you want but I'm not talking about Mind Over Matter necessarily I'm talking about God's word in your mouth not you just saying well I'm a good person I'm this and that I'm great I'm wonderful I'm Divine you're a blabber Mouse leading your soul to hell you are lost you are miserable you are no good you are rotten just like me and everybody else in this building today we can only say what we are in Christ notice the way Paul addressed Philemon and he did not say now brother brag on yourself talk about how good you are talk about how wonderful you are he said you've got to acknowledge what you are in Christ Jesus not acknowledge what you are in the flesh not acknowledge what you are being a Reagan or a Hughes or a brown or a Smith or a gilroth or whatever you are because there's none of us have got a whole lot to brag about when it comes to that but the key was that Paul wanted this brother now he was an effectual Christian he was a Christian that had such energy about him and he was contagious what an identification so being around this brother he will just lift people up now this man wasn't even a preacher he wasn't even a deacon he wasn't a trustee as far as we know but he was just a lame member that got on fire with the Holy Ghost and I'm telling you what that man got so lit inside of his soul that people could be down and just you know I'm weary and upset and they'd get around this brother Philemon and he'd go to talking about the good things of God and the mercy of God and they would just be so refreshed when they got done and Paul acknowledged now you imagine this man's name God wrote in the New Testament what an identification his name has been called for over 2 000 years this brother's name has been written and every continent on the earth it's been translated into every language which the New Testament has been written in not because he casts out devils not because the man walked on water not because the man while I wish somebody would preach with me this morning not because this man raised the dead he did not say because brother you have memorized Ever every word in the New Testament he was known because he was such an energetic guy to be around now no doubt the man fought battles and it went through all types of things but somehow he had learned a key that there's a way to be positive to maintain being positive in Christ Jesus even though you might be sick and you might be facing battles in your life but you realize your sickness is not what you are in Christ Jesus your sickness is what you are because you're in your flesh your depression is what you are because you're in your in your flesh but your healing is what you are because you're in Christ Jesus your deliverance is what you are because you are in Christ Jesus so we will acknowledge one or the other well my lumbago is so bad my big toe is killing me my back has hurting me my side it's my pleurisy I know it's what it is and most of us are more educated about sicknesses than we are about healing well come on now all of us know how to do Dr Google don't we so we get a little symptom what do we do we go to webmd.com or we go to mail.com and my week diagnose herself and we diagnose each other I wonder how many of us have diagnosed ourselves with much worse than what we ever had in the first place oh Lord God I've got walking pneumonia oh Lord I've got infantigo I've got this and that and the other it might not have been nothing but just a little bit of coal but you spoke yourself right into a worse condition than what you had initially for a lot of us the devil don't have to say a whole lot all he's got to do is give us a little bit and we take care of the rest of it because we're so negative and we're so down and we're so weary I'll tell you one thing Jesus Christ is not coming for a defeated Church he's not coming for a defeated bride that can barely hang on from Sunday to Wednesday I believe our Lord is coming for the people that are of Victor glorious people a people that are more than a conqueror we are not just survivors we are not just barely going to make it oh Hallelujah we have already eaten by the grace of God and greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world [Applause] oh you say brother Donnie you've been listening to Kenneth Hagin you didn't listen to Kenneth Copeland now I've been listening to Elijah and Elijah said it this way if your number is not called tonight in the prayer line and God reveals your heart and speaks to you and gives you Deliverance there don't never have no kind of a testimony only only that he healed you because if you do if you one time testify to the other side I want you to listen how powerful that a negative testimony is you don't have to do it day in and day out week in week out month in month out all you got to do is one time listen how powerful it is if you one time testify to the other side the negative side it will come back to you worse than it ever was that amazing so one time you testify well I got prayed for but I didn't feel one thing my brother Donnie prayed for me brother Daryl prayed for me and I didn't feel one thing and as a matter of fact I got worse which is the best sign that you got healed but you know what symptoms does to a lot of people it talks them right out of the healing right out of their miracle I I guarantee there's people sitting here today that they need a miracle and the truth if it is you probably ain't that far from it and God's waiting to see that she'll be faithful right down to the last confession just think of it you might not be but one confession away from a total Deliverance of whatever it is that's bothering you you might not be but oh Hallelujah you might not be but one confession away from something that you have fought for years and years and it may look like to the Natural Eye you're farther away that's only the devil trying to tell you that he's scared to death because he knows you're within that post of your Miracle younger than that close of your healing you're within that close of God Satan your husband saving your wife bringing your children back to the economy of God hold your confession brother sister keep speaking the word until it becomes so energetic Hallelujah that it causes a Revival down in your soul oh my goodness the negative side it will come back worse than you ever was I love the way he says this as opposed with Moses let him this week say I am strong see just say it in your heart that I am strong I now accepted Jesus as my healer never have any negative testimony anymore never just believe that God is under obligation Jesus Christ sending it to right hand of the father to accept you he's saying there as a high priest of your confession to make good before the father anything that he died for that you're confessing that he done and the church said notice again healing is not something you say well yeah I believe it I believe it that's all right if that's the best you can do just mentally or just say well yeah I see it I believe that I accept it that if you accept it on those basis you say what am I supposed to do I'm fixing to tell you keep saying it over and over say it out loud onia I say it to myself say it out loud so yourself will hear yourself saying it so yourself will hear yourself my husband is going to be saved my husband's going to have the Holy Ghost my wife's going to be delivered my child is going to be healed of this whatever it is Satan you might as well get out of the way because it's fixing to happen hallelujah hallelujah oh God you imagine the prophet Dan whenever he's an African he said a man that never walked in his life had been crippled his entire life but he heard of the signs and the Wonders and the Miracles that God had done and on his way to service the man bought himself a pair of shoes Hallelujah while he was putting his face into action guess what after the service that night he put him on and wore them out why because Glory he believed he believed enough to act on the promise of God or you said brother dawn of the doctor and give me six months to live I'll tell you what I'll do if I was you I'd start looking up a cruise maybe on the Caribbean I'd maybe look at a vacation up to Alaska or even one to Asheville if you can't afford no farther than that I would not buying out my funeral I would not pick out my flowers I would not line up for preachers I'll tell you when I do that it's when God tells you when is God going to start using the devil I'll tell him every now and then when he tells me you can't make it I'm this and that and hell I'll start saying oh did you get saved that when did God start using you as a mascot to give me a message if God wants to tell me something he ain't going to use the devil if God wants to tell you something he ain't going to use the Devil he's going to use the Holy Ghost he's going to use the word he's going to use the prophet of God he's going to use a man of God so when the devil goes to telling you thou stuff tell him to shut up stop devil I ain't got time to listen to you [Applause] now notice how you are you're born under this law of conscious even actually after you're born again he says you just say well I believe it I accept it then you accept it on that basis keep saying it over and over say it out loud say it over and over just keep saying I'm Healed I'm Healed say it until you actually believe it so you mean sometimes we're not actually believing what we're saying yet yet why would that do that because there's something about you hearing yourself say it's not enough that you hear me say it it's not enough that you hear Brother Dale and these other minister Brothers say you've got to say it yourself and you've got to say it out loud why because a man in the engine room and the man up here in the head are two different men and the Man Down behind the engine room is the one who really really believes you may have set up here oh I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm Healed and the man down there so you better not say that now you better not testify you know every time you testify you get worse I must notice that I've seen it whenever we're going to testifying about God doing something for Erica it never seems like it never ceases to amaze me how Satan will do it I'll testify of something she'll testify her mama will testify this so testify how's Erica well she's doing good praise the Lord she's had some really good days it's amazing whenever you publicly will acknowledge it and the devil will turn right around and make it worse how many has ever experienced that same thing you're dealing with a situation you testify praise God I believe I got the Holy Ghost I believe the Lord delivered me of this and that and then you think boy within a week's time you ain't fighting nothing but Devil's everywhere and you say well I think I'm going to testify again that's exactly what he wants you to do he uses that intimidation on you to keep you from testifying of the goodness of God because her such power in you saying the word yourself listen to me Bobby you're gonna be healed listen to me body you're gonna be delivered Hallelujah listen to me body oh brother Donnie said I tell other people I would I would because it might be right there as it was with John Ryan when he was sitting there getting a shave and a haircut and he's blind as a bat yet he believed what God's Prophet told him is that right and they're ready to kill him in the barbershop making fun of him in the barbershop oh I heard you went doubt that Holy Roller meeting I heard she got healed yep praise the Lord right there well I heard yeah well how come you're still blind all of a sudden they're out of his mouth come this confession of faith and his eyes come open sitting right there in the barber chair Oh Glory to God here he goes running down the street with shaving cream all over his face and there goes the barber running right at you why he spoke his own Deliverance he was only one confession oh Hallelujah he was only one confession away from a full manifestation of his Deliverance wow well I gotta be honest yeah I do I'm a preacher and I study the word apartment well I fix this mic I studied the word I preached the word and I confess the word but just sometimes apparently I don't believe it oh you self-righteous Hypocrites it's going to sit down judge me answer you believe it up here but you're still afraid down here it won't happen it's absolutely amazing when you as a Believer start believing [Laughter] brother oh my God I cannot believe why I'm just being honest I'm just being honest what you need to be with yourself don't blame God I a lot of times it ain't in the devil's fault it's our fault don't have a negative testimony every time when you confess well I still feel bad today you go straight back in the same rut that you was had in the beginning there's not a man or woman in here baptized now listen to this with the Holy Spirit but what you start your confession I believe I've lost the Holy Spirit I've lost the Holy Spirit I believe it's gone from me you'll go right down has it left you not by the Seal of God no but you believe that has and you will start down notice this again don't never have a negative testimony testify positive Jesus has healed me I'm well go and you'll receive your healing you said that's too simple it is it's too simple for us well you want some rocket science to send it for your day to preach to you do your power Square I don't have a pie ever solve us around I mean maybe people around the world make Square pies but I ain't never seen one of them well you'll want some great Theologian to stand up and fill your head with a bunch of intellectual something or do we not to be able to hear the word of God that'll make what we've already heard so affection in our lives Oh Glory to God Hallelujah notices he says again let me skip down about a paragraph or so there's not a Christian in here no matter how solids you are in the face that right now that you something happened to get a hold of you and you are not a Christian and you start testifying well I'm not a Christian no more you dropped right then you're no more a Christian anymore as soon as you testify that you're not a Christian you've dropped from Grace did God cut you off you did did the pastor cut you off you did what's what as soon as you testify you're not a Christian you drop From Grace right then you're Fallen your own speech tells what you are oh my well brother Donnie what can I do how can we be able to handle this look when God has even made it though we're still in these types of bodies that he will make your body obey your confession let's skip down again to our brothers let's go to who is God 1950 remember God will make your body come into your confession if you say you're a drunkard and want to drink don't worry you'll soon be one now notice he didn't say they were but they would soon be one because of their confession if you say you're a sinner and want to sin you'll be right into it if you say you're a Christian and believe it along God will bring your testimony will bring you right into it this is one reason I love to testify about the Rapture I love to testify about the change in power of God that's going to bring me right into it by the grace of the Lord God will make your body obey your confession now let's jump another and our brothers come down to Philemon chapter 1 verse 6. that the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus I don't know what to say now I may get fast and I may get so fast I sound like a Gatling gun but these will be on the notes so you can study them you can say things like this I'm forgiven come down and show them my brothers I'm forgiven I'm saved I'm redeemed I'm Justified well that's enough right there to take a series on I'm forgiven on what basis because he died that I could be I'm saved why I have accepted God's provided way for salvation which does not include feelings it says nothing about if you don't feel it you ain't got it it don't say nothing about them it works on Sunday but it ain't good on Monday my Holy Ghost is good on Monday through Sunday Sunday through Saturday it's good 24 7 it even covers leap year amen I am Hallelujah I am forgiven I am saved I am redeemed I'm not who I was I was a sinner born to this world lost by and wretched miserable deserving of hell as far as my own nature but I have been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb I have been thought a price has been paid for me I do not belong to the devil he has no claim on me he has no claim on my soul he has no claim on my walk I am more than a conqueror I have victory in Christ Jesus because I am redeemed [Applause] I'm Justified Justified us freely by his grace I'm not just forgiven I am justified under the opening of the seventh seal it was that you never did it in the first place Hallelujah I am bought and purchased so I don't belong to myself and this is one reason why I Don't Preach what you all want me to because you all don't own me the message people don't own me the devil Don't Own Me there's one that owns me that's my boss and I obey him I am bought and purchased my body is his Temple hallelujah what God once dwelt in the Old Testament in the Tabernacle and in the temple now the spirit of God dwells in my body and your body my body is a temple of the Lord I have eternal life praise the Lord praise the Lord I have eternal life I ain't going to get it like a while brother Jack I'm not going to win to Sumter Lottery and see if I can be able to do some good marriage so where I can be able to get eternal life I already had it this morning right in my possession I have eternal life I wonder what kind of people we turn into if this is what we started posting on Facebook people would think you're nuts I'd rather them think you're nuts in some lying gossiping trouble-making church members well preach mother died I have eternal life I have access to God I have access to God at one time I couldn't even approach him at one time I was not even worthy to call upon his name but I've got access to him 24 hours a day I've got access to him when you are sick and you call me three or four o'clock in the morning and I wake up out of a dead sleep I have access to the throne of God I have access when my children are sick I have access what I'm feeling down I have access or glory to God when the devil says he's going to kill me I'll have access whenever I feel it I have access one adult I have access what I'm not I have access when I'm down I have access when I'm in the middle I've got access anytime I needed access to Healing access to Deliverance access to Salvation access to whatever I need from the presence of God hang with me now I'm inseparable from Christ glory to God I am inseparable well the Lord lets me preach this at some of these youth camps I'm scheduled to preach this year I am inseparable from Christ I can no more be lost in Christ himself can be lost the devil can no more pull me out of the hand of God that he can pull Christ Jesus out of the very Heart Of God you are inseparable he loves you he died for you he died so that you wouldn't have been able to be born again and never be separated again at one time we were separated from the presence of God but not anymore but I don't feel it but whenever you don't feel it she'll keep quoting it I am Inseparable I may not feel it it may not look good but I am inseparable foreign than a conquer but this is some of us praise to me brother Donna have mercy God have a mercy I'm at my last dying breath no I let Amy down to sleep no doubt I'll never make another people or you can be like the light the wife of Muhammad Ali so Muhammad Ali would practice fly like a butterfly hit him do that and then he fought and knocked their lights out but his wife walks in and says I'll take the check hallelujah hallelujah she didn't have to exercise she didn't have to run around and around and around and lift weights and watch what she wanted to eat all my she didn't have to count with calories and counter protein but she could just live life or glory to God you don't have to go to the Cross you don't have to die on the cross you don't have to go down the Hades it was your husband all glory husband the Lord Jesus that did that for you and what does he want you to do take the check sweetheart take the check it's yours I've got your name wrote all over it it's yours it's yours [Applause] so imagine Muhammad Ali how'd I do done great thank you I'm going to Macy's I'm going to pennies Oh Glory to God if our lord Jesus had asked us the question this morning how did I do against sin would say master you defeated it how did I do against cancer you stalked it right back down into hell how did I do against sin how did God go against adultery thank you darling for years since I've been receiving a check from Happy Valley Church I probably haven't signed that check a dozen times because there's someone else here who signs it as a matter of fact if I signed it they'd probably stop it at the bank because they'd say that ain't the signature we've been seeing for 35 years Hallelujah why she can go right there and deposit it in whose name in mind She carries the checkbook so she wants to write somebody a check she has my name my authority oh Hallelujah if you can only realize the Lord Jesus gives you a whole book full of checks when you got saved and you know what he'd give you everyone you'll ever need for every battle ever sickness ever disease ever heartache have a trial ever test you'd ever go through all you got to do is sign that thing and pull right up to the teller of Heaven say I need a good dose of the Holy Ghost today I need some Divine Healing in my body well go ahead and sign your chat oh well you say brother Donnie will they check our ID yep we already have an ID that's the blood of the Lord Jesus by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and whenever you pull up in there you know how it is now with what we've got today I've got to set up here in my iPad and I've got face ID so whenever I touch that little home button at the bottom what will it do it looks at this ugly mug and said yep that's him all right go ahead and open it up well I'll tell you I've gotten more than that I've gotten more than that when it comes to my account in heaven so if I need healing I've got a face ID and but when the Lord looks he don't see my face he sees the face of the master he don't see your face and you sell all my flaws all my shortcomings that's right we've got scars we've got problems we've got trouble but he sees his face his face it's his face it opens everything you need [Applause] he will renew my strength I have value in God's eyes I am the Apple that does not mean what US westerners think that you're looking up in the apple tree which you'd have a hard time doing in the winter time wouldn't you so you look up in the apple tree and say oh I want that Apple so bad so bad oh no this Hebrew rendering here is not that you're looking on an apple tree it is actually the pupil in your eye called the Apple so I am the pupil of his eye when he looks out he looks to grace and mercy that's the way he sees me I'm not an apple hanging on a tree I'm an attribute from his soul a soul of God that was in God before the foundation of the world I am the apple of his eye well if I don't hurry ain't never going to get done I am accepted in Christ God will meet my needs I am the righteousness of God in him I hope every devil in the internet is suffocate time will you get done with this today I am God God he cares for me amen I am watched over boy I

that's what you ought to be saying about who you are I said I ain't no good I ain't no count I'm rotten I'm low down get that garbage out of your mouth Hallelujah Hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus don't you love him oh hope the Lord lets me preach this in Louisiana camp I'll tell you what I'd like to be preaching some more down brother Fred Mullen Church they had done toward that church smacked down you white folks ain't caught his emotions and black folks are you all need a little help they'll go ahead brother Donnie oh don't you love him how many wants to let this be your confession this is who I am God these are not from the words of some intellectual person you know I'm not that these are backed up by God's words God's words you're all that I said this morning and even more even more my goodness if we was just one third of all that it would be unbelievable would it not since we were nothing since we were Liars drunks homeowners and whatever more and we've become all of that I didn't even stretch the surface of what you are what could we become friends you imagine poor brother Philemon bless his heart he had been running through this church this morning hit of them doors have been flying wide open ever Deacon in here had been after him and if that had chased him out of the foyer brother fully mind probably headed up on the parking lot Johnson City police would be acting by now the rescue is going to said this man to start raving mad so what world happened to him he's listened to a holy ghost-filled preacher that began to tell him all he was in Christ Jesus he had a spell when Paul wrote him about 2000 years ago but now that the seals have been opened which wasn't open when Paul was here don't you see how much more it tells us what we are why you need that you need it we fight such discouragement in the day we're living we need to hear these things I need to hear that anybody else need to hear I'm too old to be a person like this another confession I am old but I'm fixing to be young oh Hallelujah let's pray dear Jesus thank you Lord thank you for what we've heard I've been wondering all week long as I'd sit down to steady where I thought I was going to go today I've been wondering why I just something just didn't seem right and I didn't know what it was even yesterday Lord sitting there last night studying this morning laying our Wide Awake Lord for ours pray Lord what is it what is it I don't understand dear Lord you started making it real to me thank you Father truly we needed to hear these things today foreign oh Jesus may we be changed by these things father may it not just be sayings that we write down but may it become Who We Are may we become so energized by the word being effectual in our lives granted father and which of us are different we have no record that you ever danced in the spirit when you were here we have no record that you ever fell out in the spirit we have no record that you run around the walls of Jericho and many of those things we have no record that Paul ever done any of that Peter James John and we don't believe that you're against that but father we know that people worship in different ways and we know those that tend to be so extremely emotional they tend to look at those that aren't they well they're not worshiping like I am well they're going to categorize them that they'd have to put you out and put Paul out because we have no record Paul ever danced in the spirit have no record that Peter Andrew John but I believe they worshiped you they praised you they adored you with all of their hearts so help us to move away from the carnality of wanting everybody to do like we do because we think we're the perfect example help us to realize your Prophet gives us that variety when he talks about Paul the scholarly preacher Peter being the Firebrand Andrew one way and John another way that's the way you made them no doubt there were people in that Apostolic church and they received the Holy Ghost and they danced and shouted and received the presence of God there was others that received the same spirit of God they might not have been near as emotional as the other but they didn't measure it so much by the way they expressed their emotion they measured it by the life they lived when they got done screaming and hard help us I pray father I don't want these people to be like me I don't want them to act like me I want them to be the way you want them to be now if there's some of them standing here today Lord and they're scared of emotion and they're scared oh if I turn loose I'd scream and holler I pray you would change them from that but if they're standing here today and say Lord if you want me to run I'll run if you want me to scream I'll scream don't let me jump straight up and down I'll jump straight up and down but Lord it'll take you to move me that way well they're just as willing as the person who does it because that's what you're looking for a willing heart so if you want to dance a shout us jump us run us whatever you want to do we're here today we're fine with that if you want us to stand here and cry and tickle tree tears trickling down our eyes as we Rejoice over what we've heard today I'm willing to do that too oh Lord God we bless you father we worship you I'm a worshiper we can add more to our confession today I'm a worshiper I'm ordained to be a worshiper Hallelujah so we'll praise we will adore we will magnify your name some have been ordained that their testimony would be healed and delivered from cancer some have been ordained we know the blind man whatever the disciples said Lord who sinned this man or his parents he said neither one but the glory of God might be made manifest Lord God I wouldn't want have to go through what brother John's Spencers went through for nothing in the world Lord God sometimes going before he ever goes to the pulpit vomit eight ten times before he ever gets there I've sat by him on the platform and his sugar goes through the roof and then other times bottom out yeah Lord we believe you're going to manifest a miracle and our brother's body we know he's a miracle every day the doctors are absolutely astounded by why he's even living but Lord we're waiting for you to finish it up same with others that we're praying for father you know how me and Carol's been praying for a long time for Erica all we asked from point A to point B from day to day strength and all of that but we've been giving you praise for a long time for that well body because I got pictures of her on my phone my picture that I look at when I text her when I call her because her hair hanging back down her back Hallelujah not a look of sickness on her face but the lookness of a well body the expression of a whale body Hallelujah day by day we press the battle until that manifestation is complete not only her but others here today father I pray you'd minister to us Lord help us Jesus forgive me for my negativity forgive my sheep father forgive us for being O Lord so negative help us I pray to be energized by the spirit of God we worship you Jesus we bless your name Hallelujah can we just worship Him Now for just a little bit before we go this is your house we don't have to watch the clock this morning the way we did at Holiday Inn and be out at a certain time we can be able to stick around a little and worship and oh I know you got your dinner plans and all this that another but I really don't think there's any more important plans than what there are to be right now in the presence of God to you how many wants God to just saturate your soul with this let it become who you are don't don't forget about it by tomorrow by Wednesday write these things down if you need to put them on your phone you need a digital file we'll be sure you've got it we'll make it where you can download it download it from our website I don't care if your iPhone blows Plum up I don't care if you're a
