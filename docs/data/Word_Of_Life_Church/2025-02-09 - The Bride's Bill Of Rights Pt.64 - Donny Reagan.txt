disease that affects the bone maror a stem cell transplant was decided that it was the best route for treatment Dennis received the transplant and the doctors deemed it a complete success now the they're going to show you a picture or two of Dennis when he was rolled in here and the prayer that was made so Brethren if you'll do that for me you can see the the pictures there on the screen very sick man he was deemed one in a million his survival chances were were just very very slim very slim and if you go to the prayer now that was prayed for him that day I me like to be remember today would you just raise your heads with me it's brother Dennis Fleer maybe some of y'all don't know him sister Sandy bag's brother-in-law he's been dealing with cancer and now he's got another situation going on in his body we're just asking God to be merciful to him today heavenly father it's written in your word they will lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover dear God you see the diagnosis of the doctors have given to him Lord they're doing everything they know to do to try to treat him then Lord these other places coming up on his body you see how it's affected him Lord something that the doctors have just recently diagnosed and even found out about we're told in the last days that there'd be such things released on the earth that cancer would look like a toach but Lord God no matter how many diseases they find your blood Lord Jesus atones in your stripes has already paid the price We join our faith together father in the name of Jesus would you be merciful to our brother today Father touch his body Lord in obedience to your word we lay our hands on him right now in the name of Jesus May these things leave him Lord he wants to live father he wants to live

Karen Reagan had seen Robin at the grocery store somewhere out just a little while back and uh Dennis will Proclaim that he is a walking miracle and we believe that with all of our heart this morning

night on Saturday night people got out and had a great big time so they think shot up drunk Affairs fornication fils today they can't hard to get out of bed some of them won't get out of bed cuz he had an overdose went out into eternity to meet God but God has allowed us to fill a pull yes which seems crazy to the people who live in the natural world because what they're drawn to is things they can see and shoot up in their arm and drink and and we say we're in love with this being that none of us have ever even seen him I've never reached out and actually touched him like that and yet he has turned my world upside down oh yeah and if he's this good and visible I can't wait till I get to see him can you praise the Lord are there Zach and sister Susanna if they'll bring her little son Ezra will'll dedicate him to the Lord today praise the lording bring them in bring them in from the fields of sin bring them in bring them in bring the little ones to Jes let's just B it together heavenly father is a whole little Ezra in my arms today I think of his nam's sake what a great man Ezra and the scripture turned out to be I pray father as my brother and sister bring their little Ezra into your presence Lord Jesus would you help him would you help them I know most of the time whenever I dedicate a baby I don't just pray for the baby but I pray for the parents because I realize a lot of what this child in my arms will become will be greatly to do with what they teach him not only by words but by actions Behavior attitude so father I ask you to be with them today Lord You've add added another one to their quiver another little boy I pray father that you'd give them wisdom and strength to be able to know how to raise him nurturing teaching in the ways of God may always have a longing to go to the house of God to clap his little hands and sing and worship you what a better way could there be to bring up our children singing loving worshiping Jesus when we see our nation how low it's gone that they're trying to change little boys into girls and little girls into boys and our government into the state that it's in the rotness how we're longing for a new kingdom to come upon the Earth Jesus but until that hour arrives we accept our challenge I dedicate little Ezra to you today Father watch over him keep him from the evils the sicknesses diseases of the day we dedicate his life to you now in the name of the Lord Jesus amen he woke [Applause] up God bless you let's Stand Together shall we be a trust trustee meeting after service today back at my office with the brothers if they would um also I want to mention something else to you before we read in the in the scripture today there's a little something that I'd like to do for our our U smaller children before we built this new facility here we had a playground and things out here on the grounds and of course we had to take it up whenever we did all the constru instruction and we haven't put anything back for our children and I'd like to um be able to put something back for them as you can tell I'm a little bit old to be slinging and sliding and all that sort of thing but we've got different things for different age categories and we've got different things over in the fellowship hall for some of the older ones so I just wanted to make mention that to you we might lift an offering in a couple of weeks or something I just wanted to make that known to you that before whenever we had had um other stuff that we had we built it out of treated lumber and um a lot of folks had to have splinters pull out their hands and their arms and the legs and this and that I can tell but looking some of them here today they've had them before so I don't want to do that this time I want to get something that'll be nice for them something that'll hold up for a long time um and my kids and my grandkids both are beyond the age of needing them so I'm not doing it for no personal reasons okay and I I can assure you the day you see Carol and I out there on them call 911 so I'm not doing it for me or doing it for my kids or grandkids but I would like for our smaller children to be able to have something so you just uh think about that in a couple weeks or so we will U we will lift an offering for that let's um turn to Second Peter chapter 1 again today if you would the right to be in divine order what a blessed thing it is Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue let me read again now the meaning of the word add because the King James version doesn't kind of render the right thought of it but it means Minister nourishment to supply furnish ministered unto or assisted so in the Greek it's in the possession of your faith Minister virtue so it's like each one of these virtues that are attained it becomes a stepping stone to another to another to another until we arrive to that image that God desires us to be verse 6 un to knowledge Temperance and Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity how may Lu to be remembered today as we pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your precious word I wonder how many sermons have been preached on these things over the years since Peter wrote it over 2,000 years ago inspired by the spirit of God yet I think I can say it without any hesitancy there was never a greater sermon preached on it than what you placed upon your prophet's heart in this end time that he would entitle it the stature of a perfect man Paul never mentioned these words in consecutive order that Peter did and as my studies of have led me down through different ministries of the church ages I've not found any others that dealt with it quite this way so we believe there must be something that you've reserved for a portion of this for our day with that comes great responsibility but we're not just going to stress out over the responsibility but we're going to focus on the responsibility but also the Fulfillment of it help us today I pray father speak to us the words of Life In The Name Of The Lord Jesus and the saints of God said amen amen God bless you I'm going to be praying wearing this prayer cost today so we keep that on our hearts for our brother Bernie as well God's plan is so simple and yet it can be so profound that the mind of man just simply misses it because of the way that God goes about bringing it and to think that God would even deal with us is overwhelming to me and all of our failures and all of our mistakes and shortcomings and yet to think that his greatest accomplishment and achievement Through the Ages I've often wondered as we gather around him in eternity and we're there praising and worshiping and adoring and we know that the prophet told us that heaven is actually going to be a continuation of this same life it was kind of a must have been a puzzling thing to to the people as they wondered what it would be and the prophet would drop statements for us here and there to let us know that you say brother Brandon will I love my wife and he said oh yes more than you do now and she will be something that was just be yours so it won't be like children and many people get the false false conception because the sixth Dimension and the way it was like when the prophet was there and he saw his wife come up to him and he said I'm going to see what she says and whenever she came up she said oh my precious brother and somehow people think in their mind oh so that's the way it's going to be for those that are Eternal mates it'll never be like like you were in this life that you were special but remember that's in the sixth Dimension but whenever he walked up before the Throne of God for rewards one wife slipped her hand in one side the other wife slipped her hand in the other side and they walked down together before the Throne of God to be able to get the reward of what they did so if Heaven is a continuation of this same life I don't think we'll be floating around on cloud CLS singing playing Harps and you know funny looking guitars and different things like that but we're going to live we're going to enjoy life it was astounding to me when I first heard the future home and question an 64 which followed it and then a couple more services thereafter that heaven will consist of parks and avenues and streams and fountains and trees and we will actually eat in that glorified body and the fruits and the leaves on the trees will be eaten by the inhabitants of the city so the fruits will actually change every 30 days and yet the leaves will be for the healings of the Nations so the people will come in and pull off a leaf from the tree of life and they will hand one another a leaf and say brother at one time we Ward against one another and we were we were enemies but God has restored peace so when we think that God's great achievement is not to turn us all into angels I was never made an angel I'll never be one now I have an angel but I will never become an angel you see my angel is my theophany and that theophany one day will become in me as the complete unit but I will never fly around with wings on my back I was not made to be an angel I was made to be a man but I have a sophony which is my Angelic representation of deity and when you think about what God is doing we look at it in this life and we see so much faults and so much imperfection all around us everywhere and you you realize that no matter how full of the Holy Ghost people are they still have their flaws and the Saints said and we still have people that let's be honest that we love and we go to church with and maybe even members of our family we may never totally like everything about everybody that we go to church with you can go ahead and say it that's all right it's just the way that it is it's just the facts but one day everything about each of us that are that is not very likable will be changed and it won't just be the other people that like should be you too because there's things about every one of us that just aren't very good they just aren't very likable and things that God wants to change and if we're not careful we get our focus on our spiritual walk with God just on those natural things and that becomes the measure by which we measure our Christianity so we hold up the spiritual measure in tape and we're measuring all these flaws and all these faults and all these mistakes and you are never going to get to a place in lifee where you're going to be free from them and the prophet even tells us about people that create a certain atmosphere and he said they're nice people they're good people but he said you just don't enjoy being around them because of that atmosphere that they create but can you imagine living in a world where there'd be Millions times millions of people and there will never be anyone that you'll ever shun there'll never be anyone that you'll kind of just walk real fast because they're coming in the entrance back there and you'll walk a little bit faster so you don't have to run into them now I'm just saying that you know just in case I'm just throwing that out in case anybody here does that I know you all are so sweet and such Little Darlings ain't nobody does that yeah right but you know it's all of us that there's something about us in our human makeup that will never reach that great place of compatibility until eternal life totally engulfs our humanity and our humanity is finally changed so when we're looking at the stature of a perfect man a son and daughter of God that is in a Rapture Ready condition or those that will go before the Rapture and go by the way of the grave now you may be wondering if you're following through some of these sermons and listening to them what about those that have already gone and those that we've had many in our church that have already went by the way of the Grave where will they fit brother Donnie did they arrived to that place yes the elect of God arrived at that place before they left this world but remember much of the preaching that will continue on years after they're gone is not just supplementing us in our spiritual walk with God but it's giving us the spiritual sust and strength that we need my daughter Erica no longer needs to hear sermons preached about faith and sermons about forgiveness sermons about love and sermons about things like that but I still meet them because I'm still dealing with human beings you all need them how many still needs to hear forgiveness preached how many needs more forgiveness in your heart so all of those Saints before the Lord takes them they arrive to that spot and then they're able to be sealed away into the kingdom of God but also into the church AGS that they live now remember the Lord will never take one of his elect seed from this Earth before they have arrived and the last few days of their life might be the finishing touches that they need or the last few weeks I've seen it so many times myself and watch as the children of God are are losing losing life and they're coming down to that spot and you just watch and as a pastor me knowing things about them and in my heart be troubled about certain things about them and be praying for them of course and if I feel in my heart to say something to him and watch God one after another after another take care of that little something that's lacking in their life and in their walk with God because he is not going to do a halfway job on any of his children you have that confidence in him I have it not on in it for me but I have it for you as well so he's going to do whatever we La so as we're looking at this don't look at it as it's absolutely totally impossible it's not and the hard part is being able to differentiate between us measuring the flawed human part and the Soul part which will be able to manifest every one of these attributes that God wants and I I find it amazing as the prophet would bring this that he would bring different parallels of the scripture and he would kind of cross the types back and forth and he would bring it as it was a body he would bring it as it was a natural body it's also a m mystical body and here in Statue of a perfect man he says this is the house that God dwells in not a body with a big Bell on the top of it and a high steeple but a body H has thou prepared me now in the natural sense we had all kinds of issues when we were building this building right here we had all types of stipulations and I honestly think the city made new laws is we was building this building because they made things made us do this and do that and the other and it seemed like every inspector that we dealt with had his own agenda against us and they made us do certain things that the Builders said they had never seen anybody else be required to do well if they made it hard on us because of who we were God will make them answer the day of judgment for that but I see that as also in the spiritual sense that there's certain things now before we could move in here and they would give us the final inspection and what is known as a certificate of occupancy and they gave that to I guess brother Michael was the one that got it he gave it to me laid it on my desk oh it was an absolute Victory whenever I walked in the office and I saw it laying there with our name on it and the date and so on and so on and they gave us the official certificate of occupancy and our building was rated to be able to seat 1,1 people now that was all wonderful and all but you know what it gave us a right to do to be able to no longer meet to work on it no long longer to meet and paint it and lay carpet and lay stone but it actually gave us the legal right to where we could meet hundreds of us at one time and that way the city would come by and they wouldn't throw us out and shut us down now this is what we're looking for and our certificate of occupancy from the presence of God now all along there have been brothers that was meeting all times of building contractors trainers electrician you know men doing different types of things in the screens and the audio and the video all kinds of people were coming and going so it wasn't like that there were not human beings that were in this building and some of us I can tell you it felt like we were living here because we were here from before daylight there was days I showed up here at 4:00 in the morning and I wouldn't leave till 600 or 7:00 at night and yet it felt like I was living here Carol felt like I was living here but it wasn't really my permanent residence but everything I was doing it was getting it closer to that day when we could open for the first time and we could invite the presence of God but we could also invite you to be able to come and we wouldn't be worried about somebody from the city showing up and say you all can't do this well you see that's where we are now we're in this stage to where God has started this work inside of us and many of you go back and listen to the Statue of a perfect man Blasphemous names a few excerpts from the ordination of the minister also why against organized religion some of the different places that the prophet would refer to this and it might make you wonder well where am I on this chart where am I on this statue of a perfect man and I don't mind telling you every time that I knew that the inspectors was going to come in it was a nervous day for me because it seemed like everything we'd take care of that'd always come back with something else and this needed to be done this way they come in and we thought we had all these panels just exactly right now you don't know it but run in behind all of these walls are all types of plumbing and all types of different things they were so nice but the city and Spectre come in and made us redo it so we had to cut holes in it you see this so Square panel right here got a little tiny piece of tape down on the bottom of it that was a code violation so we had to be able to redo it and then they would write off well then we'd meet their great specific desire and would come in and brother Phil and his crew did all the handrails and they come in and looked at them they done a tremendous job look beautiful they come in and look at them and say that won't work it's got to be done this way and this way and this way you don't what we had to do redo every one of them so they come in and we fix this and then they find something else and they fix that and they find something else that's the way it is in our lives you know so I said why don't they just come in and give us a list and we'll do it all at one time and be done but you know what I found out that ain't the way they do it they want you to fix this and then they come back you fix that you know as I've been looking at this I realize that God does us in a very similar way brother Rudy that we fix this in our life and then God come in and expecting said yeah you're looking good so here's another list and you say my Lord I thought I was expecting my certificate of occupant he said oh no no you're a good way from the capping it you're work in progress and you already have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it's already immersed you into that m IAL part but these things are living out of you so it starts off of course with the the new birth and it begins then with the very first one that is there is Faith and you cannot believe in any of these things without faith being there and then one's Faith becomes a a dominant force and a dominant power in your life not only to save you but to heal you but to deliver you and this is the thing about faith that Faith's understand understands that God says yes and Faith also understands God says sometimes wait a while Faith also understands that God says no sometimes now emotional faith gets tore all to pieces When God says no emotional faith will absolutely destroy an individual whenever they are expecting a yes but God gives them a resounding no but real Faith believes him even when he says no because they know he knows more about it than they do and the church said now we've all had nose have we not and no doubt we'll get more of them and I've got to be honest you know I I don't like the nose as well initially whenever he gives them because we have anticipation for yeses and we're looking at yeses and thinking in our mind and our heart that the yes is always bringing more Glory but that's not necessarily the truth sometimes NOS will actually bring him more Glory because a no leads into many many weeks or months of Trials of misunderstandings and trying to you know figure it all out in our mind and when we're going through what seems like a rejection of a no because just be honest a no from God seems like a rejection but sometimes it's actually a greater display of his glory than had he brought it with a yes and the church said amen now if we start out with faith which comes from the spirit of God giving us the ability if any person comes to God they first must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him now watch I I I've never found were brother brandom ever liken this again because it's quite astounding because he's quoting the scripture that referred to the Lord Jesus and it was of the prophet of the Old Testament where that he prophesied and said lo I come in the volume of the book and lo a body hast thou prepared me so he quotes this and he said a body has thou prepared me a body that God can dwell in so now he takes that Prophecy of the Lord Jesus and runs a parallel to his bride so as the Lord Jesus was the body the human body that God could walk in so this is what we call the son of God then God walked in the Son of God so God was made a son in the flesh of the Lord Jesus and then he applies this same scripture then on down to the extension of that which is the body of the Lord Jesus so now where is is the Corporal body of Jesus of course it's on the throne of God so you believe Jesus has eyes on the earth you believe Jesus has hands on the earth well where are they here's two of them there's two more there's two more there's two more you believe Jesus have has got mouths on the earth how many want your mouth to be his what about ears What About Eyes what about the ability maybe sometimes just to put your arms around a brother and just let him know that you love him and that you're praying for him you understand what that is that can be Jesus that can be Jesus I I'll never forget it there was a man that used to attend our church years and years ago and he he came into the office one day back at the old place and he he wanted to talk to me and uh you know the conversation that he and I had it didn't go really good because he he he believed some different types of things and kind of strange things but I I've sitting there praying and I said Lord please help me help me to have the right attitude help me to be able to to to let this man exceed the real love of God and as we finished our discussion and he didn't change me and it was eite I didn't change him but as we finish the discussion I said brother you mind if I shake your hand before you go and he said no no that's fine brother so I took him by the hand and as I did I was just praying God please help me emanate your presence in such a way that this man will feel enveloped in your being as I took him by the hand like this and I put my arm around him he was taller than me but I I pulled him kind of close to me and I just stood there with him you know with my arms around him and he he broke down and started crying and he he told someone else from the from our church sometime later he said I've been in the presence of God since I was a child I've shouted I've spoken tongues I've told all different manifestations of this that and the other but he said I have never and my entire walk with God felt such a presence and it was like it was coming from brother Donnie now you know I cannot do that you know no human being can do that but I saw in my heart once to come back to me uh quite sometime later what greater thing could you and I do as the people of God that for the Lord Jesus now Donnie Reagan don't have any presence aren't that I'm not a great person I don't have an aura about me that's really wonderful and fine and all that sort of thing but what I desire is that people can be able to know that greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world and that though people might differ with you and I now you know I I guess for me looking at it I could have thought that it would have been a greater happening had it been a more pleasant type of conversation and it would have been something that would have just been rejoicing and fellowshipping but that wasn't really the way that it went no neither of us were argumented or anything like that but yet it just you know it just wasn't quite in the way that I wish it would have been but the Lord wanted to cap off a negative type of situation but he wanted to cap it off with his presence now I had the spirit of God and I believe that brother had the spirit of God but God wanted to cap off that meeting with something that would change that brother's life and I don't mind to be honest with you every time I talk about it and it's been years and years ago I still feel that's something inside of me I'm feeling it right now as I'm talking about it because it was a presence of God quite unlike anything I'd ever experienced before myself I've shouted and Run and Jump and dance and done all types of emotional Outburst but it was is as if though someone had embodied me for a few moments using my mouth using my arm my hand to embrace this brother and you know my my friends I desire more than anything in my life for for that to be something that is so prevalent in my life I've seen God heal the sick I've seen God perform Mighty Miracles and signs and wonders and I love every one of them and I thank God for that but to me there's something about his person that I value even more than I do those signs and wonders and miracles I love gifts I thank God for the gifts but yet I don't just want the gifts I want the life of the gifts as well because we've all seen people that would manifest gifts and then know what kind of life that they lived outside the word and that right that it wasn't even the spirit of God so sure let's have the gifts let's let's use the gifts that God gives us but let's not leave out the most important part which is the very life and essence of God's Own nature after all when we get to heaven when we go beyond the curtain of time for those of us who will go there before the Resurrection The Prophet never mentioned one person beyond the curtain of time that spoke in tongues he never mentioned one person that had a dream or a vision one person that interpreted one person that prophesied and all the references that I found and cross reference back back and forth he never mentioned anything about the display of the gifts why in the sixth Dimension they didn't need them but what was the predominant Factor Divine love perfect love oh now this is why I know it stumbles some people in the message it shouldn't really but brother brandham said that he he longed for the time when the gifts would be laid up on the shelf and the love of God would Comm in the church and just take the church over he was not against gifts my goodness he preached many many sermons after he said that in 1956 I believe it was about the necessity of the gifts in the church but yet he focused on what was the priority of getting Divine love then if we get Divine love then the gifts that'll flow through it to the Avenue of divine love how many want more that in your life now what God wants us to be is a body a body has thou prepared me a body that God can dwell in God can walk in God can see in God can talk in God can work in amen living instrumentality of God God walking on two feet in you the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of God God walking in you for ye are written Epistles read of all men and if the life that is if it's in Christ be in you it'll bear the life that Christ bore is that right notice again he said now we put the blood of Jesus Christ in notice what happens whenever we come to him now remember there's three step stages of the new birth that is justification by faith sanctification of the spirit and the true baptism of the Holy Ghost now I can become a little bit confusing now because there was a Pentecostal age before the token life now for those of you that were never there it might seem very unusual to you and you've heard me say it before that I believe I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost whenever I was a child many of you some of you I should say come from Pentecost and no doubt you received something from the presence of God when you were in Pentecost because our life changed but yet unlike others who've come to the message and believed all they needed was a change in their theology I believe that I needed a furthering of my experience in God to match the message I believe that I'm I was missing something in Pentecost and I found out what it was it was the token which is not exactly the baptism of the Holy Ghost but the true baptism in the Holy Ghost in the true realm which is the realm of the Soul now whenever brother brandham is laying this out remember that he starts out with the new birth what you also have to keep in mind now in this time frame in 1962 he's still believing and of the mindset that the new birth is you receiving Christ as your savior amen testing 1 2 3 1 2 3 come on friends let's let him advance in his understand let's let him advance in his Revelation before God now look I do not compare what the prophet said to what I believe I compare what the prophet said to what the prophet said okay okay not what I believe I'm not interested in your opinion I'm not interested in what you think I'm interested in what he said but I am going to compare what he said to what he said and if I see that he grew I have no problem what whatsoever and preaching that gross and I have no problem in preaching it to you and preaching it in the message I know people don't like it when you do it but I'm called to preach the message and if I can't preach it all I ain't going to preach none of it amen so I'm going to preach gross I'm going to preach it right there because he himself did now watch so whenever the new birth and reality comes to us now he says we put the blood of Jesus Christ that brings the face of Jesus Christ the virtue of Jesus Christ so it's not my faith it's not your faith it's not your virtue but if we're not careful when we read this in Peter it will be like it's something that we actually do then I have to make myself have virtue and I'm the one who does it it's not mine it's his well if it is his how can I add in the way that King James says it how can I add which we would think something exterior of of oursel and we get it we work into it whatever it is we do and we get it and we physically add it to us and we do it ourself how can I add the faith of Jesus Christ how can I add the virtue of Jesus Christ the knowledge the temperance how can I do that I cannot but if I acknowledge my need of it and I see my need I open my life before him and say Lord I need more faith how many can say that today Lord I need more faith I need more virtue I need more knowledge I need more tempers well what are you doing you're coming to the first stage of God being able to step from Faith to Virtue to knowledge to Temperance to Godliness all these virtues that God himself wants to add an us now remember he says in this that there are some of these are nature given so there are some people that by Nature they just have an element of virtue and they could just help people you seen people like that and they they didn't even have the Holy Ghost but they had a feeling for Humanity and whenever they saw people in need whatever it was all their their heart their human heart it was just so so pulled upon and they would they would Minister to them whatever it is that they had what is that nature given virtue there could be a nature given knowledge a nature given Temperance but still I don't want nature given there's some people that's just nice you know they're just nice naturally and there's others they just don't have a good makeup but God wants to make them have a good makeup now you see that person who is nice naturally it'll be very easy for them to think they've got these when in reality they don't because they were born that way but this does not come by your first verse but rather your second one so the faith of Jesus Christ The Virtue of Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus Christ The Temperance of Jesus Christ the patience of Jesus Christ the godliness of Jesus Christ the brotherly kindness of Jesus Christ and the love of God which is Jesus Christ so Jesus Christ is allowing his faith his virtue his Temperance his knowledge his godliness his brotherly kindness to flow out of us and then he himself the person caps us off the Capstone is what himself after his virtues has manifested thems in us and they will become to where you said Brother Don what are they going to do control you control you so God will allow you in negative circumstances and when your faith runs to its end then the faith of Jesus Christ will step in and help you to believe what you didn't have faith enough to believe for and maybe your virtue would run out and yet something Beyond you would automatically step in and you would start ministering virtue and strength beyond your own capability oh oh my goodness some of you is going to realize it's already been happening to your Shores the world and where did you get it at not from you so it was oh I'm going to pray more I'm going to read my Bible more that's good you do need to do that but that's not the way you're going to get more virtue you're going to get it by seeing what it is and allowing your ability to see I'm short I'm I'm short of what I need oh God lord Jesus live your virtue out of me me live your godliness out of me get your eyes off of preachers get your eyes off of ministry and so well they're going to do it all no no listen some of you Ley you may never cast out a devil in your entire life you may never Lay Your Hands on a cancer Pati and curse that cancer and watch God heal them yeah you may never ever stand in a prayer line and pray for hundreds of people and watch God heal them but there's one thing every one of you can do and must do you must let the statue of a perfect man flow out of your life remember Sister Florence Shar she went to Brother Brenham and she said brother Brenham I fasted and prayed and fasted and prayed that God would let me cast out Devils he said sister you were not called to do this but you were called to fast and pray for those who's called to do it and you say well what can I do what can I do and and some of you think in your mind well it's not really that much are you kidding me I'm talking about you becoming a habitation for almighty God and you think that's not wonderful you think that is not one of the most tremendous mendous things that could ever oh but brother doy what about sign his wonders there will be people that will walk before him that day and say I cast out devils in your name I heal the sick I've done this and that and he'll turn and say to them depart from me you worker of ini nickle I never even knew you but there won't be one son or daughter of God that will stand before him that had these virtues in their life that will ever be turned away it's totally impossible Oh my he is the head that controls you your feet is the foundation face amen controll by the head you see it takes the people there you are there is the perfect man of God when he possesses Miracles when he possesses gifts shouting running oh I believe in all that don't you I love doing it when it comes here's the perfect man of God the one who possesses these virtues God represents his church as a bride and the way he brings each individual to bring his son to go in that bride he's also brought the bride through these ages till he brings one complete Church into this now remember this is the the pyramid the stature of a perfect man my feet moves why because my head says so now it can't move like my hand because it's my feet lucer can't do the things that we did neither can the Methodist because they were something else see the feet moves because the head says so and the head never says now feet you become hands watch the spirit of God will never lead you and I into a place that we're not called and qualified to do that's the spirit of God will always lead you into your position and that is he will magnify the presence of God in your being to help you fulfill what you were called to be and don't you accept this today friends is something that's not very great I'm talking about something that the smallest portion of humanity that you can ever imagine will ever be able to attain to what you're hearing today and you think you're not doing much you think you're not called for much you're less than one in a million I guarantee you that for God to be able to manifest himself in this now once he said this being when it's completed is the Church of God going to the rapture and this being when completed is a servant of God in the Church of God that's going in the Rapture so his Focus oh my is building a house for God the being the individuals that come to this PO our bride material Rapture Ready amen word fed spirit filled so when you're surrendering notice now he doesn't put past tense that you surrendered one time as each one of these virtues becomes a stepping stone for the other you are actually giving more of yourself away the first stepping stone being face but that is altogether different than virtue so you surrender that element of yourself that tries to diagnose everything and try to figure it out from your mind and and make sense of it all oh you let that go and you let Faith his faith come in and it displaces all your intellect if it goes contrary to the word and then it gives you the energia which is the Greek word to be able to strengthen you as now okay you're doing doing good on faith now God wants you to take the next step all right so now here you are you moved up onto this step of virtue which is still very small very very tiny and you may not even know that it's there yet but God will arase opportunities by which you're able to minister virtue sometimes it might be in word form sometimes it might be by cooking a meal for somebody sometimes it might be by coming in and just putting your arm around them and praying for them brother sister I know you're through such a hard time I love you so much and just want you to know I'm standing with you and you don't even realize but from your being just left some of the strengths of Jesus Christ now I know it's hard for you to understand it I've told you about it before but whenever you're having a prayer line I know some of you have looked at me it's like what in the world you know you pray for four or five people and all of a sudden one comes soon it's they just knock your lights out and there'll be other times you'll pray for you know just all kinds of people and never do it you know and all you are is like a channel like this microphone this microphone could have wound up in a rock and roll concert it could have wound up in a symphony and be be used for whatever more the microphone ain't nothing but it's what the person that gets it and the words that are coming forth of this microphone demons have been cast out through this piece of metal right here Devils have been made to leave the children of God through this microphone this microphone itself it has no power it has no ability no more than I do but what are we were channels by which the supernatural God can manifest himself and one person come through happened you know a month and a half two months ago praying for someone in the church right there they walked up I laid my hands on them and started praying for them it's like they reached inside of my body and pulled every bit of the strength that I had out I wasn't even sure that I could even stand up as a matter of fact I fell sideways and some of the brothers see me car asked me sure she said Donnie what in the world happened I said I don't know I don't know I was doing great I was feeling good I was feeling fine and I said all of a sudden when that one person come up it's just right they reached in and pull that strength out of you oh but I'm glad there's strength there but you see God don't just want don't say oh brother Donnie ministers to the people no no don't think that oh well brother Donnie does brother Daryl does the ministers do God wants each of you Holy Ghost filled Christians God don't want me ministering to everybody God Wants You In Your Capacity whether by words as I said or by Deeds or you get up 3:00 in the morning you got a burden for brother Daryl or you got a burden for some Minister whoever it is and you're praying and praying and you get done and it feels like yours weak is a dish rag is we saying you say what in the world happened you broke into a realm with God and God took your fervency God took your faith and you gave your strengths in that moment of time to be able to minister prayer for someone in need oh tell what we want Saints notice this now he said this is the people that's going under Rapture so when you're surrendering your complete being then the Holy Spirit just pours through you in these virtues praise the Lord so every one of these wireless microphones that we have have to be set on a different frequency if not they will override one another they can produce static every one of these that you see are on a different frequency now whenever we order them we order them years ago and I'd order them I would order them on one frequency and get another and get another and try to keep up with all the different bands of it but now they've got them to where they're multiple bands and we can go in and select the frequency because sometimes the lights or maybe an amplifier or some type of electrical something will interfere with that frequency and I would get up to talk and there would be something in there and it wasn't a gargle in my throat it was something from the frequency but it doesn't mean the mic isn't working and it doesn't mean the batteries are dead and it doesn't mean it's not hooked up to the board back there but it simply means something got in the channel of the frequency and many of you are looking and think Lord do I have the Holy Ghost I don't know if I've got it or not oh no no it's not necessary that some of you do have the Holy Ghost you've just got too many things in the ways of your frequency oh my that's why the prophet tells us it's the father trying to make himself known to you but you let too many things in life get in the way now you see this is what God is Desiring for a bride and friends we're not just talking about us as our local assembly we're talking about God doing the same thing all over the entire Earth at the same time and at the same time when we come to this spot and we are kept off then God will call for the resurrection do you realize how imperative that this is there will be no Resurrection if God does not produce this in a body around the world right is anybody worried about it this morning you worried about it brother Philip what about brother Matthew you worried about that God ain't going to do it we get all uptight I ain't a bit more worried than a man in the moon my God said it my God will produce it oh but brother Donnie me that yeah me you I understand me you I ain't looking at me and you I ain't looking at our faults and our shortcomings I ain't looking at your temper I ain't looking at your lack of Brotherly kindness I'm looking at the promise of his word and his word says he's going to do it the word tells us through the message of the hour that there's going to be a people that's going to possess these things and I say Amen well I'm a long way from it well you may be but you ain't going to be because you're going to come to the promise of what God Said Hallelujah and if I got to get this measuring tape out every night for the next 57 years and preach on it every day and three times a week and start a 7-Day Revival once every three or four months we are going to arrive at this spot by the grace of God because God will not fail this word our Saints are waiting on us Paul is waiting on us Peter the man who wrote this in the Bible is waiting on [Applause] us when the Holy Spirit just pours through you oh Lord God maybe for those of you that have never experienced God using you you to pray over a person and then be healed some of them visibly right there in your eyes others Maybe by process of Divine Healing it's hard to explain what that does see and I've had God to do that for me brother John you other minister brother Joel Brown all you other brothers here whenever you you just know beyond a Shad of a doubt that work is done I mean it's so awesome whenever you stand there in that presence and you realize what God just did through your Humanity dust mere dust and you laid these dust fingers and dust muscles and dust Bones on a human body and God used your dust Mouse and you curse that demon and that demon leave it's so wonderful but I've seen some of them same people that that happened to get sick again so we're pointing to a direction in these virtues that are irreversible so a person can get their healing and lose it but Peter goes on to say about this if these things be in you you shall never fall you'll never fall short of the glory of God oh my goodness friends think how much greater in that sense to achieve these in our life sir then you're a living Tabernacle then people look out and say there's a man full of virtue knowledge believes the word Temperance patient godliness God brotherly kindness full of the love of the Holy Ghost walking around what is it a stature that unbelievers can look at and say there is a Christian now this is common terms to us Christian we say it so much and we hear it on signs we see it everywhere Christian Christian Christian Christian you work with people that say they are Christians and they're devils and because it's so called to us it's not the value of it but whenever a person can say this about a real one there's nothing they could say any greater if you were a millionaire or a billionaire or a trillionaire if there was such a thing as that oh my oh my he's a billionaire you're might blow out your chest and say oh wow they're talking about me they're talking about me but depend depends on which way the stock market goes and what else Trump shuts down and whatever Doge does this and that and the other you may be rich today who knows what you going to be tomorrow but if you ever get this right here for 10,000 times 10,000 of years you'll still be going down the streets of Glory saying praise be to God every time you walk out that City and turn around and come back in you will see your own image and the reflection of the house you live in when you walk outside them City Gates and turn right back around and God sent you over to Afghanistan or aler or wherever he sends you on the king's business amen and you turn right around and come back into that City and there's the 12 foundation and there's that Great Pyramid City you know what you'll see you'll see your own life you'll see the grace of God because you're going to live in the same oh Hallelujah geometric design that God designed in your soul oh you say but how much perfect love do I need he'll give you just exactly the measure that you need for the glory of God oh my the thing of it is just let it start flowing yes sir my there is a man or a woman who knows what they're talking about you never seen a Kinder sweeter godlier person you're sealed and the seal shows on both sides whether you're going or coming they'll see the seal just the same there you are what a man or woman possess this then the Capstone comes down and seals them into the kingdom of God which is the Holy Ghost and remember the Dynamics of this church will be the Capstone again which we've had in part while The Headstone has been descending a refilling I'm glad there's refilling aren't you now look the spirit of God is going to seal us into the economy of God thank you Lord Jesus watch this then the word coming from here manifest itself through each of these beings and makes it complete being a tabernacle of the Living God a walking living example of Christianity what Christ was these people are because his life is in here they are in Christ and their life is dead and hid in Christ to God sealed in there Glory by the Holy Ghost 1 Corinthians 12 you reckon yourself dead then you're born of Faith then virtue and all these other things has added to you to you're a perfect living image of God thank you Lord you you don't want to be a replica of me I don't want to be a Rec of of brother Tim PR I love him me my brother with all my heart brother Ron Spencer many of these preacher brothers friends of mine all around the world I don't want to be a replica of brother Daryl I love brother darl I appreciate him but I would be settling for so much less than what God wants me to be me brother Daryl striving for the same image I don't want to be like brother darl brother darl don't want to be like me but we both want to be like Jesus and that's exactly the same thing that every one of you l ity we all stand on the same Plateau when it comes to this no doubt no doubt I will minister to Mo in virtue and brother Daryl and some of these other brothers but you can have your own dose of virtue isn't that wonderful then God through that has brought also seven Church agents to show the seven steps that he brought this building his individual Into His Image that's built a complete Church in His image at the resurrection this complete body will be raised up to live with him forever because it's a bride so that cuts in every age every age so there's things who could say about Paul's age who could to say about the second age and the third age and the fourth age so brother Donnie if I get saved and I start out being born again and I get Faith and that's everything I need faith will lead to Virtue because your faith alone needs the accompaniment of virtue to help you keep from being selfish the rest of your Christian Life and using your face for yourself sir thank we are a body as your virtues need each other to compliment you so do we need each other in the body thank God for pastors amen thank God for evangelists too is that right thank God for other aspects of the ministry we thank God for every one of them but where would we be today had God not sent a prophit in this age with some message don't we thank God for that as well thank God for pastors but what's real true pastors of the end time preaching the message of the hour brought by a Vindicated Prophet so the prophet would bring it in a certain way a pastor would bring it in another way you know an evangelist would bring it in another way but if they're all B with the spirit of God they're saying the exact same thing now watch he said so you get it these people who died in here millions of them they died under the virtue of faith in the first church age and then virtue knowledge Temperance godliness all these things but it wasn't like they was complete within thems did they have the spirit of God in each one yes how many knows L Luther had a portion of the spirit of God but he drank beer smoked a pipe well he said glory to God I can no you can't you're living in a different age you can't drink nothing stronger than Pepsi come on well glory to God lucier made it that was his age that was where he was at but as we climb up the pyramid it's getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller look Faith may not be in comparative size to what the Capstone will be and you're looking for bigger bigger bigger we're going the wrong way on the pyramid we've got it upside down Lance we've got it started off with a pinpoint at the bottom and we're trying to build it this way well there's going to be more of us more of us we're going to do this this this this we're going the wrong direction brother Jack the big wide Foundation is at the bottom as it comes up it's getting less and less and less and less oh my and you're looking glory to God when I get perfect love I'll be doing these great big things keep in mind the proportion of the building of God Divine perfect love may manifest itself out of you to 20 people and you will have achieved your portion in the body [Music] amen don't think everybody out here is going to know you're a son and daughter of God they never will but what you want to influence it goes that God has put in your paths yes sir let me close listen to how this whole thing these people died in you're depending the whole body now and waiting on us so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection Word of Life listen to your challenge today it's not to get more members sure Shine Your Light we want everybody in here that God wants there's more out here that needs to be brought in Shine Your Light witness to them we'll baptize him we'll do everything we can do to reach him for the Lord right Miracle signs wonders yes we believe in that but I don't want our church to turn into being known as a miracle church and a sign church and that's the only reason people come healing is the children's bread we need Miracles Our God does Miracles I don't want us to be known just as a miracle sign church we want to be known as a full born Word Church what we believe in miracles we believe in signs but we also believe in brother ly kindness and I've done found it out a long time ago sometimes signs and miracles are a whole lot easier to achieve than brotherly kindness is amen so notice in order to bring the resurrection God building building honing building honing building coming up to this finale they're they're under Souls under the alt waiting for this church my daughter is waiting on me brother Jimmy is waiting on us sister Linda brother Calvin's waiting on us brother Daniel Nunley brother Jean Leman brother Jean Litteton on and on and on we could go all those Saints they're waiting oh it Ain like they're sad where they are but they're in a temporary State they have no flesh they do not have a human body in the sense that we do they're longing they're Desiring they're happy yes but they're waiting they're waiting Lord God waiting for this church to come to its Perfection but when Christ does come and this church you see is getting smaller in the minority it's a whole lot sharper than that but just so write that across there it's come up to a needle point a needle point do you understand whenever he brings her to this last stage right before the headstone sits down on her which is rapturing Faith this is our Capstone that we're waiting on rapturing faith it will be honed and honed and honed hated people will come and leave come and go smaller smaller smaller smaller until it comes in The Headstone we just sit right down on the top of it and the world will never hear the but what is that him kissing the church oh my and they're waiting for Pride Revival that's going to shake the world we're going to go to the hospitals and empty them out Jesus never even done that I believe great times are ling in front of us if we'll get our priorities right the prophet said he believed that there'd be missing limbs that would be restored I believe the same thing but he ain't going to do it so people will come and follow us because the signs that's not what we want I've seen what that produces it produces many times puffed up men and they think they're so much greater than everybody else well how can one clot of dust brag to another clot of dust I'm a bigger claw than you are I'm a more a bit more Dusty than you are well well well you old red Alabama poo dirt you and you think because you're red you go sweet taters better than black Louisiana Dirt does you're still dirt dirt bag well Hallelujah it's only the grace of God that's why we need these virtues that's why we need him so when we run into our brothers and sister that we disagree with on theology that Jesus Christ brotherly kindness will treat them the way he treats us now listen what it's going to come to the church and the minority has got to get into a place until it's the same kind of ministry that this left so Jesus started it off at the bottom with his ministry and whenever he comes back right up here at the top it'll be the same Ministry that started off at the bottom so it won't be a nickan thing it won't be a hierarchy of clergy praise the Lord but it will be a Ministry because when this headstone comes back it's got a pocket listen a pocket like here which's going to sit right there in the regular pyramid it isn't just a cap that sets across the top it's a little flange and it's got to sit there cuz it sheds the water so there's a little flange and whenever it comes down it locks all the sides and sets it and sheds the water and when it comes this church has got to be so honed all the rest of these stones in the pyramid laying so perfect till you can't run a razor blade between them how many's been to the pyramids of Egypt anybody with the tong sister Leman Carol myself it's absolutely phenomenal not only in Egypt but when we were in Israel and finding them stones and one particular Stone there that we saw longer than from this back wall to that back wall back there hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of tons and they still don't know how they made them and they even cut a diagram in that solid stone that looked like an elongated Roman ogi I have a hard enough time doing that with Hickory or black walnut and they cut that thing and I stood there with my eye brother skipped and looked at that that cut down to their perfect perfect boy what an achievement that was to cutting Rock but this is even a greater achievement to cut into hard-headed skin oh you're a greater achievement than than Pharaoh Pharaoh can say hell boys build my pyramid said well what about Lance I forget Lance can't do nothing that old boy forget Jonathan can't do nothing forget Dave Swanson he's too much of a European you know he's got this in him and that and forget Donnie Reagan Lord have mercy hard-headed stubborn oh you don't want to preach for me don't want to do this that other and God said what you call trash what you call impossible I will cut and shape and every stone will be mortared together so tightly when brother Dave and I laid this Stone right here and we had these lifts up in there we had them Stone L all around us upon the rails everywhere he had somebody down there beneath him I had somebody down there beneath me I'd measure the hole throw me a 3 by five throw me a 3 by six throw me a two by whatever and sometimes they'd throw it up and I'd catch it and I'd put it in there it's too big too big on this end they take a side cutter with a diamond bit and they knock a little of it off and then they if it needed to be if it's too long they would just cut it these stones are made whether or not solid color all the way through color is only so deep so when you cut it what you see is little tiny Pebbles on the inside so then the brothers would cut it and then they'd take a chisel or a small hammer and they'd Nick the ends of it so it would look like that it was molded to fit that certain spot God ain't just whacking and cutting and so well whatever works I don't care just throw it all together we'll use bubble gum to hold it together we're talking about a house of God that will live through eternity think of it sights of God when you leave this world in a Rapture you will be fit for eternity your character will be so molded through eternity you will be there in the great Paradise of God and when there is no more devil you still will be when there is no more time when there is no more sickness so God picks you up sometimes brother philli and hands the preacher the Mallet whack whack whack I got a text from one of the brothers of their church he said boy the Lord sure has been making a hard on me in the last few Services joined the crowd man alive a lot of us start out as a gigantic Boulder we weigh 385,000 lb we're 21 feet long four feet thick six feet tall and when God gets done with us you're the size of Kit candy all remember what the little kit candy was and you're glory to God lord you want me to fill up the whole wall he said no I had something about like this in mind now Lord God don't tell me you're going to put me underneath somebody don't tell me you're going to put me on the bottom now Lord I'm much better than that can't you see why we need more of these things in our lives and up here when the pyramid cap does come the pyramid itself the body of Christ will have to be honed the children I know cutting don't you know we don't like it but y ought to be so grateful to God that you've got a church that you can go to that's a honing Church a lot of folks in the Tri Cities ain't looking for a honing Church they looking for a bragging Church oh y'all are so good and y'all are so wonderful now don't worry about trying to be perfect and don't worry about all that stuff the Lord understands y'all can't overcome lust the Lord Lord understands some of you men want to become women and you know we we accept you here at the at our church well I do that's because of the kind of spirit that they're in there but in our church we want preachers that come through even visiting ones that have honing tools Lord if I need cutting cut me if I need chipping chip me I'd much rather be cut now than thrown into the furnace and be destroyed listen this quote I love this when the pyramid cap does come the pyramid itself the body of Christ will have to be H not only just some Creed or doctrine or something we've come through it'll have to be so perfectly like Christ till when he comes he and that Ministry so where do you figure then the people around the message that don't even believe in Ministry where they're going to fit when the Capstone comes what will it be the true Ministry of God will so match The Headstone he and the ministry will unite together what will it produce Believers that's what Ministry is for so perfectly like Christ that when he comes here in the ministry will fit right smack don't you love those theological terms write smack together then will come the Rapture the going home that's what I live for every day of my life how many wants to be ready for that hour can you see a lack in your walk walk can you see where you need to move up I certainly can but don't be discouraged now just take the tape and keep going but what you need to be in order to leave this world ready so much at his image that he would be able to say to you come away my love he will not say Come Away my flawed deficient Poor Pitiful bride that barely held on from day to day we are his victory praise the Lord let's B us together heavenly father I pray that you'd take this today Lord and make it real to each of our hearts begin with me my Lord I desire to see more of these things in my life I see them already father I believe I've received the true baptism of the Holy Ghost but I'm longing to come to that spot to where my life will add to all the rest of those lives around the world that will be able to call the dead Out of the Dust of the Earth we can pray for the sick and they can get healed and we can pray for the discouraged and they can become encouraged we we we see that happening among us but it's evident we're not yet not yet quite where we need to be because the dead have not raised yet so our crowning then is not going to be a Pentecostal explosion our crowning is not just going to be all of a sudden there will be such wonders and signs and Miracles and everybody will stop flocking to us no it's getting smaller as it goes to the top not bigger but whenever we arrive each of us Lord God I don't care if a lay person beats me to the top first Lord if it's one of these sisters so be it if it's one of these brothers so be it so the virtues of God are flowing out of them and you're daily living through their life and one one day they might have a greater need of Faith the next day they might have a greater need of virtue and the next it might be Temperance and the next it might be T knowledge whatever it is Lord we just want to live every day so when the circumstance would arise we have all that we need and we will not be short in any way there may be days we need so much brotherly kindness as we looked at it Wednesday night was Peter in the parable and how wonderfully you express that to us Lord in Matthew and then one man ow owed over $20 and something million dollar and the other man owed $7 Lord Jesus help us father sometimes we need more help with brotherly kindness all we're Pals and buddies as long as we agree doctor and go along with this and that and the other but just to sure as a little bit of difference comes between us we go to pull and off from one another forgive us Lord it shows even among Ministry it shows we need more brotherly kindness help us father not to emphasize on minorities and minimize majorities help us father that we will never ever lay aside these precious wonderful things we love you today Jesus I thank you I do not know how many from Word of Life Church will arrive at this spot but I believe there are some here today that are well on their Journey Hallelujah and they will receive that capping that rapturing face that body change thank you Lord Jesus because you have begun that work in them and you will complete it father my desire is that I'll just be one of them Lord help me Lord Jesus now if you don't mind I'll take a few moments Lord and ask you for myself spend so much of my time praying for others and listening to tapes for others now I'd like to ask you for me I've never asked you for money I've never asked you for fame for popularity in reality there's very few things I've ever asked you for from me most of them involve around the same thought I want to be what you want me to be I don't want to fail you I don't want to fail your people help me Lord that I can bring what is needful for this season may it be Anointed with your presence help me Lord God that I'll be able to be what you desire me to be your Prophet said you had virtue compassion mercy and so on so he said if we're going to be like Jesus we've got to have it help me Lord sometimes father I have so many phone calls and so many emails from people around the world with one question and another question and Lord WhatsApp and text and sometimes oh Lord it it just about becomes overwhelming the needs of your people are so so many and Carol and I will pray we' prayed in Walmart we've prayed in Lowe's we pulled over on the side of the road cuz when your children are in need it's desperate to them help me Jesus sometimes and I feel like I can't give no more may your virtue that Unlimited Supply flow through US Lord God I don't just pray that for me today but father I pray that for these brothers and sisters these mothers and they Wonder oh Lord what will I ever do I all I do is make food and change diapers and I raised my kids and Lord what have I ever done Lord God help them to realize she had been given a great special Title by the prophet of God as The Fifth Gospel Matthew Mark Luke John and mother she needs virtue to them little children she's going to need virtue when her husband comes in at night and he's wore out and had a bad day and she's had a bad day and well the devil do everything in the world try to come between them but help them Lord help us to realize the kingdom that some of us may conquer it may not be too much further beyond our front door our back door and our garage but if we can do that what a say we have done help us Lord Jesus can we just raise our hands this morning while in the presence of God may God take his great measuring tape of Christ Jesus and may He begin with me today may he measure me and see where I am and where I need to be and once I see what I'm showing up on the tape then I'll know what to ask for then my petition will be Lord help me I'm falling short help help me anybody else you're willing to do the same this morning don't let your neighbor take the tape and sometimes you can't even take it yourself cuz you'll never look at yourself quite right but may the Holy Ghost take that tape and measure you well you you're good on Fai and you're good on godliness you're you're good on that oh but your virture you still run a little bit short there son your brotherly it's a little bit short I I saw you got short with that brother there the other day and you just got a real attitude toward him you need to come on up a little higher son Lord God speak to the young people speak to the middleaged speak to the elders the seniors Lord those that are Homebound and can't even come to church father be mindful of them too would you Lord they'd love to be here because of sickness or whatever they can't Lord let them know you haven't forgot about them please father minister to us today Lord Jesus we may not be the noisiest Church in the message we certainly won't be the biggest one we may not be the richest one or really we're not interested in comparing to anyone else anyway but let our identity be a church that has so much of the love of God oh yeah we believe in gifts yes sir we believe in them with all of our hearts but the prophet of God told us he would rather have that love than every spiritual gift that you have to me that is quite phenomenal especially of a man who operated in the gifts probably nearly every day of his life after he entered into Ministry but he found the key and the key is love feel the housewives Jesus feel the little kids feel the teenagers those in college Lord God the deacons they have a tough job Lord sometimes the people might get aggravated on them because they have to speak to their kids and they have to deal with this issue and that issue I thank you for our Deacon Brothers Lord I pray that you'd strengthen them yes Lord help them father I pray for the other ministry here at the church I pray for the trustees Sunday school leaders Lord God I pray father for our brothers in the library father many times the hidden ones up there in the booth they run the sound part the ones in the upper part there they run the internet so people can be able to still stream the service and they sacrifice service after service would you be mindful of them up there today Lord Lord we don't want them to come here and try to take care of everybody else and fall short of the glory of God God themsel be mindful of each of us today Lord God I pray mold us Jesus hone us father shape us into that image Lord God I pray thank you Father we worship you today Lord this is your house Lord come and dwell father we want that certificate of occupancy when the Great inspector come inspects our faith our virtue our knowledge all these virtues and he says son you have arrived Lord we're longing for that hour when that refilling will be a the Dynamics of this church a refilling of the Holy Ghost which she's worked in part while our headstone has been descending I believe with all of my heart I have the Holy Ghost no doubt many of these people do but we just want more and more Jesus not only is this place your house but let my body be your house use my lips to curse demons use my mouth to speak the words of life help me to be so sensitive to the holy ghost that I can preach things from this Pulpit that will be so direct to what people are needing in their life that it's what they talked about coming to church it happens all the time that it'll be so direct it'll be what they prayed about because we

platform we had to double ply the plywood cost us thousands of dollars but we would not have a certificate of occupancy today if those little tiny things were not put on the bottom of the panels I want wonder how close we are today to full occupancy some of you may be here some of you may be there some of you may be wherever you are and some of you may be that close right there oh you need just that little tiny thing print out and it's stuck to your life and your Rapture Ready thank you Lord don't you want to know brother Don where are you exactly I don't have a clue you me well I can see all all of them in my life but I believe there's got to be more of them I just want to see more John more so am I greater in faith sometimes I feel like I'm greater in faith the name in virtue you know know how it feels like whenever you pray for people and you lose all the strength that you have and there's hundreds of more people in the prayer line and you know that God is using you as a channel to flow through and they have to drag you off the platform and put you back around in the back hook you up to oxygen or IV or something like that that's terrible it's an absolute terrible feeling cuz you feel like somehow you fail the Lord so no matter what we ever do I don't think humanly we'll ever get to a spot to where we feel like in our own eyes we have arrived but I've learned what's more important than me thinking I have as him knowing where I am don't leave here today down don't leave disheartened as a matter of fact we're going to pray for each other before we go and I want you to be encouraged today we are in a great hour the pyramidal body of God has never been this close to the Capstone can we just pray for one another you just lay your hand on the person standing near there if you feel comfortable in doing so Heavenly Father we know that individually you will call your children through the channel of death all your children don't pass at one time one will pass then another then another but Lord for those of us who are here in this building today who will be alive we will not go one at a time we will leave this world together they may have their hand on a brother or a sister that will experience the change with them so Lord help help us to get off off the focus of we're we're so different and we have we're so far apart and why would we want to focus on that when we can focus on The God Who can bring us together and give us what we have need of we'll never be in the same human mind what will be in your mind Lord Jesus help our church help our people father to be more and more of what you want them to be began with the pastor father help me Lord Jesus help me that I can love the way you loved yes help me Lord that I can treat people who've treated me bad I'll do it in such a way that they'll never even know that that person has done it oh some saints saw me the other night shaking hands with somebody and smiling and treating them like there's a million dollars some saints from our church little did they know that individual had called me a Judas had called me all kinds of names said all kinds of things about me and told all kinds of lies on me Lord Jesus I don't want this to be a show I want it to be an action from the spirit of God I don't want it just to be in the life of the pastor you want it to be in every one of our lives but I want to see more Lord I want to see more more forgiveness in me more virtue when I can minister to your people help me Lord help me we worship you today Father God bless you Saints how many can say it's been good to be in the house of the Lord Brother Lou bless you buddy see your Lord willing Wednesday night go in the fear of God just wanted to share this uh testimony with you uh brother George Hamlin when I come off the platform he he said the testimonies were great brother Dennis and different ones that had testified the he healing power of the Lord sister Rachel was hurting
