[11:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just a word of testimony. Uh I
[11:55] don't know if anybody I've been through
[11:57] a lot this year. you know, I've been in
[11:58] the hospital twice and uh back in April,
[12:02] the doctors took a polip out of my colon
[12:04] is five uh centimeters, which is about 2
[12:07] in was cancerous, but they said they got
[12:10] it all. So then back in June, I ended
[12:13] back up in the hospital, my colon acting
[12:15] up. The nurse practitioner said, "You
[12:17] just had an angry colon." And they
[12:18] tested me for uh ulcerated colitis, IBS,
[12:23] and uh Crohn's. And so he was thinking I
[12:26] had Crohn's and everything, but they
[12:28] said I had 10 inches of my colon had
[12:30] come out. So back in uh July, he took 10
[12:33] inches out. But you know what? I'm still
[12:36] here today and I thank God. And I had
[12:38] another colonoscopy. I had four of them
[12:40] this year. I tell you, I don't wish that
[12:41] on nobody. But anyway, uh had another
[12:45] one just last Friday and he had said, "I
[12:48] got good news." He said, "I don't have
[12:50] to see you again for a year." And I
[12:51] said, "Well," I said, "Thank God." He
[12:53] said, "Yes."
[12:54] I praise the Lord. Amen.
[12:57] Amen. [applause]
[13:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[13:02] &gt;&gt; And I know that God can answer each and
[13:04] every one of these. Amen. It don't
[13:06] matter. Just take him at his word. He
[13:08] said he's a healer. And I believe him.
[13:10] Don't you? Let's pray. Heavenly Father,
[13:13] we come to you tonight realizing,
[13:15] Father, that you're still Jesus Christ
[13:16] the same yesterday, today, and forever,

[13:30] so much, Father. And each and every
[13:32] request, Lord, that I hold in my hand,
[13:34] Lord. I might not remember each and
[13:36] every one of them, Father. But they're
[13:37] just as important, Lord, as anything
[13:40] else. No matter what it is, it may to
[13:42] them it may be so simple, but Father uh

[15:13] storms [singing and music] raging
[15:15] high. The waters around them were
[15:20] troubled [music]
[15:21] that night.
[15:24] With fear in their heart, [singing]
[15:28] they [music] thought they would die.

[16:53] darkness.
[16:55] &gt;&gt; [music]
[16:55] &gt;&gt; When the way grew so [singing]
[16:57] dim, how great it would be
[17:02] to have his steps leading [singing]
[17:05] mine [music] to walk with a master.
[17:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; All of the time. [music]

[19:04] and my body [singing]
[19:06] in pain, all I have to do,
[19:11] &gt;&gt; yes, sir, [music]
[19:12] &gt;&gt; is call on his name. Oh, why [music]
[19:16] should I worry?

[19:29] near. He lives in my heart [music] and
[19:34] he hears when I cry.

[23:58] going where the lamb is [music] alive.
[24:05] Here

[24:08] we [singing] have our disappointments
[24:11] all the while [singing]
[24:15] and [music] our fondest hopes but meet
[24:18] with bitter blood.
[24:21] Though [singing and music] by night we
[24:23] weep the morning brings a smile.
[24:26] [music and singing]
[24:28] In a city where the lamb is
[24:32] [music and singing] the light.
[24:35] So let sunlight fade but twilight bring
[24:39] its gloom. [singing]
[24:42] Not [music] a shadow can my blissful
[24:45] soul [singing] arrive.
[24:49] For I know [singing] that up in heaven
[24:52] [music]
[24:52] there is food.
[24:56] In that city [singing and music] where
[24:58] the lamb is the light.
[25:01] [music]
[25:03] [singing] In that city where the lamb is
[25:07] the light.

[25:17] I will mention over there. [music]
[25:20] And when free from toilet care, I am
[25:24] going [singing and music] where the lamb
[25:27] is the light
[25:30] of a mansion over [music and singing]
[25:33] there. And we're free from toil and

[38:22] Hallelujah.
[38:24] Oh, Father, we love you so much.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; You're such a mighty God.
[38:31] Oh, God. How we so feel humbled and
[38:35] small in your presence when you come
[38:38] among us, Lord, and make your way known,
[38:41] your will known to us. And then to see
[38:44] that you have included us in your great
[38:47] program. Father, we just want you to
[38:50] know that we love you and we adore you.
[38:53] We magnify you.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; We cannot wait to finally be able to see
[39:00] you.
[39:02] Lord, we're just happy that it's
[39:05] Wednesday again. I told Carol before
[39:07] church, I said, "I'm just so glad to be
[39:09] able to be in church again." Oh, Father,
[39:12] it's such an honor and a privilege. What
[39:15] a great privilege it is, Jesus. We love
[39:17] you. Help us tonight. Father, speak to
[39:19] us from your word. Father, you see this
[39:22] request that was just turned in. Dear
[39:24] God, Brother Marty McMord
[39:30] and Lord, pastored a little church there
[39:32] in Arkansas. Pray that you'd be with
[39:34] them as well. Granted, dear Father,
[39:37] anoint us tonight, Lord, as we look into
[39:39] your word in the name of Jesus. And the
[39:42] saints said,
[39:43] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[39:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[39:46] Well, there was a wasp that flew on my
[39:48] nose and stung me on the hand. So, I say
[39:52] we go ahead and have church while y'all
[39:53] say.
[39:56] [applause]
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Genesis 24:1.
[40:02] Praise the Lord.
[40:06] And Abraham was old and wellstricken in
[40:10] age. And the Lord blessed Abraham and
[40:12] all things. And Abraham said unto his
[40:16] eldest servant of his house, that ruled
[40:19] over all that he had, "Put, I pray thee,
[40:23] thy hand under my thigh, and I will make
[40:26] thee swear by the Lord, the God of
[40:29] heaven, and the God of the earth, that
[40:31] thou shalt not take a wife unto my son,
[40:35] of the daughters of the Canaanites,
[40:37] among whom among whom
[40:41] among whom
[40:43] I dwell.
[40:45] But it didn't say he was one of them.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; No,
[40:48] &gt;&gt; he was just in the same culde-sac
[40:51] &gt;&gt; or the same vicinity. That's the way we
[40:54] are. We are not of this world.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; But thou shalt go unto my country and to
[41:01] my kindred, and take a wife unto my son
[41:05] Isaac. And the servant said unto him,
[41:08] Perventure the woman will not be willing
[41:11] to follow me unto this land. Must thy
[41:14] needs bring thy son again unto the land
[41:17] from which thou camest? And Abraham said
[41:20] unto him, Beware that thou bring not my
[41:24] son thither again. the Lord God of
[41:27] heaven, which took me from my father's
[41:29] house, and from the land of my kindred,
[41:32] which spake unto me, that swear unto me,
[41:34] saying, Unto thy seed will I give this
[41:38] land. He shall send his angel
[41:42] before thee. He shall send his angel,
[41:46] not a host, not angels and plural, but
[41:50] his angel before thee. and thou shalt
[41:54] take a wife unto my son from thence. May
[41:58] the Lord bless his word. You may be
[42:00] seated.
[42:04] The first time that we actually can see
[42:10] that angels appeared
[42:13] in the Old Testament in the relation to
[42:15] man in the scripture
[42:18] is the very last verse
[42:21] of Genesis chapter 3.
[42:25] But it's not a very good setting
[42:28] for the Bible tells us that God drove
[42:31] the man out of the Garden of Eden and
[42:36] that he put cherubams
[42:38] on the east side outside of Eden.
[42:43] And they had a flaming sword and they
[42:47] was turning every way to protect the way
[42:51] back to the tree of life. That's right.
[42:55] And then we go for many years before we
[42:59] see an angelic visitation again that God
[43:05] is bringing down heaven to the
[43:08] constituents of the earth and helping
[43:11] them to be reconciled back.
[43:15] Part of our dowy is going to be our
[43:20] heavenly
[43:21] identification
[43:23] that will strengthen us. Sometimes they
[43:27] will also bring healing. They will bring
[43:30] encouragement.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; They will bring all different kinds of
[43:34] things to us on our journey.
[43:38] And it is a witness to us that we have a
[43:43] heavenly identification
[43:45] that goes beyond just this mortal life.
[43:49] Now, of course, angels appeared many
[43:51] times in the Old Testament. In
[43:53] retrospect, as we we read the New
[43:56] Testament and we start in the Gospels
[43:58] and we can see Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
[44:01] John. And for us looking at it
[44:04] backwards, it makes the picture so
[44:07] clear. But had we lived in that first
[44:10] century, four, five, 6 AD, something
[44:14] like that, for us to have been there, no
[44:18] doubt we would have not known the great
[44:21] things that were transpiring
[44:24] because there was no social media. There
[44:27] was no printed New Testament for about
[44:31] 50 to 60 years after the Lord Jesus had
[44:35] left from the earth or it would have
[44:36] been probably actually 25 leaving 33 and
[44:39] the first one was around 56. So it would
[44:40] have been 20 20 something years before
[44:42] they had apprented New Testament. So by
[44:45] word of mouth, there might have been a
[44:47] few people that would have heard some
[44:50] talk that angels had been appearing on
[44:54] the earth and there was certain people
[44:58] that these angels was coming to and
[45:01] making things known to them. Now no
[45:03] doubt it would have been very odd and
[45:05] very strange because the angels had not
[45:07] appeared like this at all in this
[45:11] consequence even in the Old Testament.
[45:14] Now they would appear and it would go
[45:15] years before anybody would see another
[45:18] one. And then one would appear again. It
[45:21] would go years. It might be hundreds of
[45:23] years before anyone would see another
[45:27] angel of God. And then it would be
[45:30] restricted many times to prophets that
[45:34] God would send his mighty angels to the
[45:37] common average person. Very very few
[45:40] instances in the scripture. But yet when
[45:43] we look at the New Testament, it was a
[45:46] breaking of what God was fixing to do
[45:50] because the son of man, the ladder from
[45:54] heaven, was fixing to anchor down on the
[45:59] earth and latch a hold of the throne of
[46:03] God in heaven. and the angels would
[46:07] start ascending and descending on the
[46:11] son of man. So before he actually is
[46:15] ever born and brought to the earth, this
[46:19] angelic appearance
[46:21] starts happening.
[46:24] It's phenomenal really. Let's read Luke
[46:26] 1 verse 5. Now, I want you to notice
[46:29] that I I checked it before I came out
[46:31] there just a bit ago that the angel
[46:34] Gabriel, his name is mentioned four
[46:38] times in the Bible. The first time is in
[46:42] the book of Daniel. The second time is
[46:44] the book of Daniel. But the third time
[46:46] is what we're going to read right now in
[46:49] the book of Luke. So, the first two
[46:51] times made known to a prophet. But now
[46:54] God is going to break that pattern that
[46:57] it's not going to be a prophet. It's
[46:59] going to actually be a priest. And the
[47:02] next time it'll be a woman. Luke chapter
[47:05] 1 verse 5. There was in the days of
[47:08] Herod the king of Judea a certain priest
[47:11] named Zacharias and of the course of
[47:15] Abia. And his wife was of the daughters
[47:18] of Aaron and her name was Elizabeth. and
[47:22] they both were righteous before God.
[47:25] Now, I want you to remember these
[47:27] portions of this verse. So, they were
[47:30] both righteous before God, walking in
[47:34] all the commandments
[47:36] and ordinances
[47:38] of the Lord, blameless.
[47:40] So, they are walking before God perfect.
[47:44] But notice what they're walking in. And
[47:47] they're in this stage of what God call
[47:49] righteous and blameless. So both were
[47:52] righteous before God, walking in all the
[47:55] commandments and the ordinances which
[47:58] was thou shalt, thou shalt not, thou
[48:01] shalt, thou shalt not. You can't go
[48:04] here. You cannot mix in your garment
[48:06] woolen and lenon. Don't s sew diverse
[48:09] seed in your garden. Don't do this.
[48:12] Don't do that. And they were blameless
[48:15] when it come to that.
[48:18] But now watch how people can be
[48:20] blameless
[48:21] when it comes to commandments and
[48:24] ordinances
[48:26] and miss it when God does a new thing.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; They were both righteous before God,
[48:35] walking in all the commandments and
[48:37] ordinances of the Lord, blameless. They
[48:41] had no child because Elizabeth was
[48:44] barren and they both were now
[48:46] wellstricken in years. And it came to
[48:49] pass that while he executed the priest's
[48:51] office before God in the order of his
[48:54] course. Now notice everything is exact.
[48:57] He would have been a punctual sort of a
[48:59] guy. He would have been a guy that was
[49:01] right on time, everything dressed
[49:03] exactly, pomegranates, garments clean,
[49:06] hands washed, feet washed, everything
[49:08] would been perfect to the dot.
[49:12] According to the custom of the priest's
[49:14] office, his lot was to burn incense when
[49:17] he went into the temple of the Lord. And
[49:19] the whole multitude of the people were
[49:22] praying without at the time of incense.
[49:27] And there appeared unto him an angel
[49:31] of the Lord
[49:33] standing on the right side
[49:37] of the altar of incense.
[49:40] Isn't it strange how God
[49:43] picks certain sides to do certain
[49:45] things?
[49:47] I'm sure you've noticed it that brother
[49:49] Brandon would bring the prayer line from
[49:50] the right side. The right side so much
[49:54] in the scripture was pointed out. Now
[49:57] watch. So the angel appears on the right
[50:00] side of the altar of incense and he
[50:03] appeared at a certain place. Why? Why
[50:07] the altar of incense? Why not the
[50:10] manora, the seven brain candlestick? Why
[50:14] not the ark of the covenant?
[50:16] dispensationally. He appeared at the
[50:20] right place. Why? The people on the
[50:22] outside are praying. What's Zachcharias
[50:25] doing? Offering incense. He appears
[50:28] exactly in the right season. Had he been
[50:31] beyond the veil, Zachcharias would have
[50:34] never seen him.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; So the angel of God, which is Gabriel,
[50:39] came exactly to where he was. And the
[50:44] people couldn't come into there, but
[50:46] they were paralleled that on the
[50:48] outside. They were all praying together.
[50:51] Oh, I wonder what could happen right
[50:53] here tonight if we'd all get in that
[50:54] same attitude.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; And there appeared unto him an angel of
[50:58] the Lord standing on the right side of
[51:01] the altar of incense. And when Zacharias
[51:04] saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell
[51:08] upon him. But the angel said unto him,
[51:11] "Fear not, Zachcharias, for thy
[51:19] &gt;&gt; prayer." So he appears at the altar of s
[51:23] incense. Remember when the great
[51:25] ornament of furniture that was seen
[51:28] there in heaven and what was it? The
[51:30] prayers of the saints.
[51:34] For thy prayer is heard, and thy wife
[51:38] Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and
[51:41] thou shalt call his name John, and thou
[51:44] shalt have joy and gladness, and many
[51:47] shall rejoice at his birth, for he shall
[51:49] be great in the sight of the Lord, and
[51:51] shall drink neither wine nor strong
[51:53] drink, and he shall be filled with the
[51:55] Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.
[51:59] Now, I want you to notice how the angel
[52:02] of the Lord, Gabriel, is going to place
[52:06] John
[52:08] and divide the Elijah mantle of Malachi
[52:13] 4 in two parts.
[52:17] Now, watch what he tells him. many of
[52:19] the children of Israel. He shall turn to
[52:22] the Lord their God. For he shall go
[52:25] before him in the spirit and power of
[52:29] Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers
[52:33] to the children. But Malachi 4 says,
[52:37] "Turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[52:40] children and turn the hearts of the
[52:43] children back to the fathers." wonder
[52:46] why the angel of God didn't quote that
[52:48] latter part.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Now, for those of those who have left
[52:54] this message and try to say John the
[52:57] Baptist fulfilled the same thing, you're
[52:59] lying.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; I said you are lying.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Gabriel said he would fulfill the first
[53:08] part. I'm going to take Gabriel over
[53:11] some beardrinking, shortwearing,
[53:14] backsliding man that's walked away from
[53:16] the end time message
[53:19] &gt;&gt; or some preacher standing up that thinks
[53:21] he knows more about it than a God called
[53:24] prophet and word of life said
[53:27] &gt;&gt; you want to take this one's idea that's
[53:30] idea go ahead and do what you want to
[53:31] do. I'm going to take Gabriel's word.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to take what Gabriel
[53:38] said over some theologian that thinks he
[53:41] knows more about it. No, I figure
[53:42] Gabriel knows much more about it than I
[53:45] do
[53:47] &gt;&gt; or any of you.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Now notice, he will turn the hearts of
[53:51] the fathers to the children and the
[53:53] disobedient to the wisdom of the just
[53:57] and leaves out with divine intent and
[54:00] purpose that he will turn the hearts of
[54:03] the children to the fathers.
[54:05] So he slices that prophecy right in
[54:08] half.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; And divided Isaiah 61 by 2,000 years of
[54:18] a prophetic timeline.
[54:21] [crying]
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Praise God. You know how blessed you are
[54:23] to see that tonight
[54:27] &gt;&gt; to make uh ready [laughter] a people
[54:30] prepared for the Lord. And Zachchariah
[54:34] said unto the angel, "Whereby shall I
[54:37] know this?
[54:39] For I am an old man, and my wife well
[54:43] stricken in years."
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; And the angel said unto him, I am
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Gabriel.
[54:55] that stand in the presence of God,
[54:58] and am sent to speak unto thee, and to
[55:02] show thee these glad tidings, and
[55:05] behold,
[55:07] thou shalt be dumb.
[55:10] Tell me how a sinless, blameless,
[55:12] perfect man.
[55:14] Come on, brother
[55:16] &gt;&gt; could not see such a thing.
[55:20] Can't you see how good people can be
[55:24] totally blind
[55:27] &gt;&gt; as God changes from one dispensation to
[55:30] another?
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Now, this is in your Bible. This man was
[55:35] blameless
[55:37] until this.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Now, he's no longer blameless. Brother
[55:41] Daryl, the angel of God tells him who he
[55:44] is and tells him because
[55:47] of what you have said. Now, it was not
[55:49] just that he asked a question. It's the
[55:53] attitude he asked it.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. All right.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; And Zachariah said unto the angel,
[56:00] "Whereby shall I know this? For I am an
[56:03] old man, and my wife well stricken in
[56:06] years." And the angel answered and said
[56:07] unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in
[56:10] the presence of God, and am sent to
[56:12] speak unto thee to show thee these glad
[56:15] tidings, and behold, thou shalt be dumb.
[56:18] [clears throat]
[56:20] Well, I'll tell you one thing. It's
[56:22] probably a good thing that Gabriel ain't
[56:24] here today striking everybody that has
[56:26] questions and doubts about the message
[56:29] of the hour. Cuz probably beginning at
[56:31] the pull pit to the back, none of us
[56:34] will be talking for a long time.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; I don't know that might be a good thing
[56:39] sometimes as much as we rattle in much
[56:41] trash as we talk.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; A blameless, perfect man
[56:49] that obeyed the commandments and the
[56:51] ordinances. And thou shalt, and thou
[56:53] shalt not, and thou shalt have this, and
[56:55] thou shalt, and thou shalt. And now God
[56:58] was doing something like he had never
[57:00] done before. And the man missed the
[57:04] present tense angelic visitation.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Behold, thou shalt be done and not be
[57:19] able to speak until the day that these
[57:23] things shall be performed. Now I want
[57:25] you to listen to this. Because thou
[57:27] believest not
[57:30] &gt;&gt; my words.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Now if Zacharias said I'll tell you what
[57:37] I want a scripture.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; I want you to show me a scripture where
[57:43] it mentioned my name and my wife's name
[57:46] and I'll believe it. You ain't got no
[57:47] word where I can trace it back to the
[57:50] Old Testament and prove it. Where is
[57:52] there even a John in the prophecy?
[57:57] &gt;&gt; There ain't no such a name. I I I I'm
[58:00] challenging you by the word.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Watch it know it all.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Cuz you'll find out you don't know it
[58:10] all.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; And not only that, you may not be able
[58:12] to speak what you do know.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; The same angel that can open your mouth
[58:18] can shut it,
[58:20] &gt;&gt; can't he?
[58:22] Now watch. Because thou believest
[58:25] not
[58:27] &gt;&gt; whose words?
[58:29] &gt;&gt; What?
[58:33] &gt;&gt; So when God sends an angel
[58:37] &gt;&gt; and people refuse
[58:39] &gt;&gt; to accept that angel's message,
[58:42] &gt;&gt; come on.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Dangerous thing, friends.
[58:48] because thou believest not my words. Now
[58:51] I want you to listen to the perfection
[58:54] of God's word which shall
[58:59] be fulfilled in their season. Now I'm
[59:03] going to say something right now that's
[59:04] going to blow some of you away.
[59:07] There are words that God has allocated
[59:10] in his people's lives
[59:13] that he knew must be on divine sovereign
[59:19] promise whether or not you even believe
[59:22] it.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Sarah never did believe. The prophet
[59:30] said she never did believe it. If it was
[59:34] left up to us, us and our weak measly
[59:37] faith, we still wouldn't get off the
[59:39] ground. There ain't no way in the world.
[59:41] You know how there's going to be a bride
[59:42] there? Divine sovereignty of God has
[59:46] already spoke. There is a bride and
[59:49] nothing, including herself, will ever
[59:53] stop her from being here. Because you
[59:56] and I would look at this, well, I don't
[59:57] understand. We have this question. Well,
[59:59] what about that? What about that? What
[1:00:01] about that? But God says, "My word will
[1:00:04] be fulfilled." And there ain't nothing
[1:00:07] going to stop it. Time ain't going to
[1:00:09] stop it. The world ain't going to stop
[1:00:11] it. Our fears ain't going to stop it.
[1:00:13] Our anxiety ain't going to stop it. And
[1:00:16] that's the way with the allocation of
[1:00:18] certain divine promises. There ain't
[1:00:20] enough devils in hell. There ain't
[1:00:22] enough preachers in the pull pit. There
[1:00:24] ain't enough unbelievers in the world.
[1:00:26] His word will be fulfilled.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Now, wait a minute. I thought
[1:00:40] that if we didn't believe certain things
[1:00:42] said about us, it couldn't happen.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Well, that's true to a degree,
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; but there's certain things that God
[1:00:52] knows how we are,
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; and there's certain things that he gives
[1:00:56] to you, and if you don't believe them,
[1:00:58] they won't happen. But when it comes to
[1:01:01] your destiny,
[1:01:04] it's already been predetermined.
[1:01:08] For those whom he did forno, he did also
[1:01:11] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:01:13] image of his son. And the original digot
[1:01:16] says it this way, for whom he did forno,
[1:01:19] he did previously mark out copies of the
[1:01:22] likeness of the son of himself.
[1:01:26] previous mark out copies of the likeness
[1:01:29] of the son of himself. He could not
[1:01:32] leave my destiny up to my free moral
[1:01:35] agency. Oh, I know some of us are free
[1:01:37] will Baptist, but it comes right down to
[1:01:39] it. Boy, my free will. Glory to God. I
[1:01:42] went down to the altar and I grabbed a
[1:01:44] hold of the horns. No, you didn't. God
[1:01:46] grabbed a hold of your horns and shook
[1:01:48] the devil out of you and absolutely
[1:01:51] converted you and smacked you up the
[1:01:54] side of the head and said, "You're a son
[1:01:56] of God. You're a daughter of God. You're
[1:01:58] not going back to the world, but Lord, I
[1:02:00] want to." He said, "I said you're not
[1:02:02] going back no more, but God, I can't do
[1:02:05] it." Yes, you can. But God, I'm too
[1:02:08] weak. No, you're not.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's the way
[1:02:14] [screaming] our God does it.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:23] Because thou believest not my words
[1:02:26] which
[1:02:29] shall be
[1:02:31] fulfilled.
[1:02:34] And yet part of those words were words
[1:02:37] about him, brother Daryl. And he didn't
[1:02:40] even believe what the angel said about
[1:02:41] him. How you know that, brother Donnie?
[1:02:43] That's the very thing that he threw back
[1:02:45] in the angel's face. I'm [screaming]
[1:02:47] old.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; I can't do this. There's no way. He was
[1:02:52] doubting God's word about him and about
[1:02:55] his wife that it couldn't happen. The
[1:02:56] angel of God said, "All right, boy.
[1:02:58] You're going to be dumb."
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of dumb folks in the world
[1:03:01] we're living in.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; And it ain't their tongue.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; It's her supernatural intelligence. Huh?
[1:03:07] You're going to be dumb because of this.
[1:03:09] But the word [screaming] I spoke
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; shall be fulfilled.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Now let us move from Elizabeth and
[1:03:23] Zachcharias
[1:03:26] to Luke chapter 1 26. I find this
[1:03:29] amazing because Luke remember was not
[1:03:31] actually in the message as we'd say at
[1:03:34] that time. So Luke was a Jew, but he was
[1:03:38] raised and cultured in the gentile ways.
[1:03:41] Speak many, many languages, educated,
[1:03:44] doctor. So Luke didn't come around till
[1:03:48] sometime later.
[1:03:50] Now, according to the Bible, we're not
[1:03:52] supposed to accept anything without two
[1:03:53] or three witnesses.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; So I'd like the second and third witness
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; that Gabriel came to Zacharias. Come on.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; I love it when the Lord does that. I
[1:04:08] mean, it just I just love it. He loves
[1:04:10] to fry that devil's hide.
[1:04:14] I want to know who else
[1:04:17] said this happened
[1:04:20] beside Luke.
[1:04:22] Do y'all believe this is the Bible?
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Do you accept it as holy scripture?
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But we've only got one man's
[1:04:32] word for it.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; And that one man wasn't even there.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; So y'all accept it?
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; All right, I'll go ahead and read the
[1:04:44] rest of it then cuz he's also the only
[1:04:46] one that says this one this way.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; That's why I have no problem when God
[1:04:51] sends a prophet messenger to the earth
[1:04:53] and he preaches the seals and says all
[1:04:55] kinds of things that other people didn't
[1:04:57] say. I have no problem accepting that
[1:04:59] myself.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Now, notice Luke 1:26. And in the sixth
[1:05:05] month,
[1:05:07] the angel Gabriel
[1:05:10] was sent from God, and to a city in
[1:05:12] Galilee named Nazareth,
[1:05:15] to a virgin espouseed to a man whose
[1:05:18] name was Joseph, of the house of David.
[1:05:21] And the virgin's name was Mary. And the
[1:05:24] angel came in unto her, and said, Hail,
[1:05:28] thou art highly favored, the Lord is
[1:05:32] with thee. Blessed art thou among women.
[1:05:38] And when she saw him, she was troubled
[1:05:40] at his saying, and cast in her mind what
[1:05:43] matter of salutation this should be. And
[1:05:46] the angel said unto her, "Fear not,
[1:05:50] Mary."
[1:05:53] Oh,
[1:05:55] so this angel
[1:05:57] knew people's names.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; He did not have to ask them their name,
[1:06:04] did he?
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; He could tell them their name.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, he could.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, I I've been sharing some this week
[1:06:13] of some discernments that I found.
[1:06:17] I'd sure like to share them with the
[1:06:19] rest of you sometime, too.
[1:06:23] When God's prophet would call people
[1:06:25] out,
[1:06:27] tell them their first name, middle name
[1:06:30] sometimes and last name. Tell them what
[1:06:35] was wrong with them. Tell them what
[1:06:37] their house number was,
[1:06:40] what street they lived on, what city
[1:06:44] they were from. And in one of them that
[1:06:47] I'd sent around, he told them the area
[1:06:50] because he was singing it in a vision
[1:06:52] where they were coming from and it was a
[1:06:54] lake or a body of water and described
[1:06:57] how it was coming into this country and
[1:07:00] it was Paduca, Kentucky.
[1:07:02] Another one was a small place in
[1:07:05] Missouri and he calls the name of that
[1:07:07] place Kennet, Missouri. Well, I can tell
[1:07:11] you even to this day, if you blink your
[1:07:13] eyes and you go through Kennet, you
[1:07:15] ain't even going to see it. I can't
[1:07:17] imagine what it was. Right, brother
[1:07:18] Daryl. Brother Daryl's been through
[1:07:19] there many, many times. Uh, but yet God
[1:07:22] was so particular and the way that he
[1:07:26] would have Why was this done, friends?
[1:07:29] So we could recognize the Lord Jesus was
[1:07:33] here, not William Brandham. the Lord
[1:07:35] Jesus, it was his ministry on the earth
[1:07:39] that had come to call out a bride.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Now, had it been only the signs and the
[1:07:45] wonders, then we would have known right
[1:07:48] then there was something wrong. God
[1:07:50] never sends that type of phenomenon
[1:07:54] without bringing a message. The
[1:07:56] phenomenon will come first and the
[1:07:58] phenomenal events will start happening.
[1:08:01] It's in order to get the attention of
[1:08:03] the people and the messenger is baiting
[1:08:06] the hook. So the hook is hanging there.
[1:08:10] It's hanging there bare and it's hanging
[1:08:12] there exposed. And God will send a sign
[1:08:15] and he will send a miraculous and the
[1:08:18] supernatural and he will cover the hook
[1:08:21] so the fish will not see it. And then
[1:08:24] the spirit of God will launch it out
[1:08:26] into the water and he'll go to reeling
[1:08:28] in. Now what's he looking for? a rainbow
[1:08:31] trout. A rainbow trout. But you see that
[1:08:35] rainbow trout will run away from a bare
[1:08:37] hook. So you've got to have bait on that
[1:08:40] hook. [clears throat] What does the
[1:08:41] devil try to do? Try to impersonate that
[1:08:44] supernatural phenomena in order to take
[1:08:47] away and make the real look smaller. Oh
[1:08:51] hallelujah. Now watch the angel Gabriel
[1:08:55] how he deals with a woman. Not a
[1:08:58] preacher, not an evangelist, not a
[1:09:01] teacher, but a woman.
[1:09:05] Oh my. Thou shalt conceive in thy womb
[1:09:08] and bring forth a son, and thou shalt
[1:09:11] call his name
[1:09:14] Jesus.
[1:09:16] He shall be great and shall be called
[1:09:19] the son of the highest. And the Lord God
[1:09:21] shall give him the throne of his father
[1:09:24] David. He shall reign over the house of
[1:09:27] Jacob forever. And his kingdom of his
[1:09:30] kingdom there shall be no end. Then Mary
[1:09:33] said unto the angel,
[1:09:37] Mary, you're going to question.
[1:09:43] Now, Zacharias raised a question
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; and got in big trouble. That's right.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; But Mary's going to ask a question and
[1:09:50] ain't going to get in trouble.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Wonder what the difference is. Attitude.
[1:09:55] Yes, sir.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; She's being honest. She's not asking
[1:09:59] that question out of unbelief.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; You see, that's what Satan loves to do
[1:10:05] when people go to question the message.
[1:10:07] Well, I don't understand this. How come
[1:10:09] that? I can't put that together. and
[1:10:11] they go to web pages and websites and
[1:10:14] they go to talking to a bunch of
[1:10:15] unbelieving devils and won't even talk
[1:10:18] to their pastor, won't even talk to
[1:10:20] godly men of God, but they hang around
[1:10:23] that bunch of garbage out there that's
[1:10:25] as polluted and hellbound as they can
[1:10:27] be. Come on, somebody. Let's have church
[1:10:29] tonight. You're not even doing something
[1:10:32] sainely by asking men of God who've
[1:10:35] given their entire life for this
[1:10:38] message, for this word. and you'll go to
[1:10:40] websites and go to read this book and
[1:10:43] that book. Why don't you come and talk
[1:10:45] to men of God that you've seen God heal
[1:10:48] the sick through their hands and seen
[1:10:50] God raise the dead right in this very
[1:10:53] church building and you'll talk to
[1:10:55] unbelievers and infidels and agnostics.
[1:10:58] Come on children. I said come on
[1:11:02] children. If you're going to have
[1:11:04] something there and you got a question,
[1:11:06] come to men of God that God can help
[1:11:08] lead you in the right way. Mary was not
[1:11:12] smitten because you had a question
[1:11:14] because she was asking in sincerity,
[1:11:18] not in doubt.
[1:11:20] Amen.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; You see, when Judas saw the high
[1:11:24] expensive perfume that was poured on
[1:11:27] Jesus head and on his feet
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; and he looked at it and said, "How come
[1:11:32] this waste?
[1:11:35] This could have been sold for, you know,
[1:11:37] how muchever it was. It could have been
[1:11:39] sold and given to the poor." And John
[1:11:42] knew him well by this time. And he said,
[1:11:44] "Not that he cared for the poor, but he
[1:11:48] was a thief."
[1:11:50] So Judas asks his questions too. I like
[1:11:54] to look at where the question is coming
[1:11:55] from. A sincere heart that's trying to
[1:11:59] understand or the heart of an
[1:12:01] unbeliever, an infidel that only wants
[1:12:04] to argue and debate. I'm not going to
[1:12:07] spend too much time answering them kind
[1:12:09] of questions cuz it's basically a waste
[1:12:11] of time.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; I'll spend day and night. God knows it's
[1:12:15] the truth. I have spent hours and hours
[1:12:18] and hours trying to find answers to
[1:12:20] people's questions. If I feel it's
[1:12:22] sincere, but if I feel it's not sincere
[1:12:24] and I pray over them and God just pulls
[1:12:26] it away from me, I'm not going to waste
[1:12:28] hardly no time at all. Why should I? I
[1:12:30] get that one answer, they'll give me
[1:12:31] another. And I get that one answer,
[1:12:33] they'll give me another. And I become so
[1:12:35] consumed and trying to answer the
[1:12:37] questions of people that don't believe
[1:12:39] in the first place, I take away from
[1:12:41] those who really do believe, and I could
[1:12:43] help them. I'm not going to cast my
[1:12:46] pearls before swine. So go on, Sue. Stay
[1:12:50] away from me. I'm not interested in
[1:12:51] feeding hogs. I want to feed sheep.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Then said Mary unto the angel,
[1:13:03] how
[1:13:06] how
[1:13:08] shall this be seeing?
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; I know not a man. Now look at what
[1:13:13] Zachcharias said. How can this be? I I'm
[1:13:16] older. My wife is old. And what's Mary
[1:13:18] doing coming right back? How can this
[1:13:19] be? I've never known a man. She's going
[1:13:21] to the flesh just like Zacharias did.
[1:13:25] But there was a difference
[1:13:28] in the heart.
[1:13:32] And the an angel answered
[1:13:36] and said unto her, "Thou shalt be dumb.
[1:13:42] Two people asked two questions. Neither
[1:13:45] one of them understood.
[1:13:47] One of them got smoked dumb for nine
[1:13:49] months.
[1:13:51] The other one received the word.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:13:57] And the angel answered and said unto
[1:13:59] her, the Holy Ghost
[1:14:05] shall come upon thee, and the power of
[1:14:08] the highest shall overshadow thee.
[1:14:11] Therefore also that holy thing which
[1:14:14] shall be born of thee shall be called
[1:14:19] the son of God.
[1:14:22] And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth, she
[1:14:25] hath also conceived a son in her old
[1:14:28] age. This is the sixth month was her who
[1:14:31] was called barren. For with God nothing
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; shall be impossible.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; And Mary
[1:14:42] said,
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; "Behold
[1:14:46] the handmade of the Lord.
[1:14:50] be it unto me. The Bible did not give us
[1:14:56] her name
[1:14:58] in Isaiah
[1:15:01] that she would have to receive by an
[1:15:05] angelic message and hear her name called
[1:15:10] through that angel's
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; message. Oh yeah. G.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Now notice, it was not the mighty Elohim
[1:15:17] himself
[1:15:20] that come down and call Mary,
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; but he sent an angel messenger.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; And the angel messenger called her by
[1:15:33] name.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; You know, in other words, saying
[1:15:36] something like this, I'll no longer call
[1:15:37] you church,
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; but I'll call you bride. Amen.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; And when them word, that seals comes
[1:15:42] open, then you're hearing your name. Am
[1:15:44] I hearing Donnie Reagan? Are you hearing
[1:15:46] Rob Weber? Are you hearing Lance Parker?
[1:15:48] Harry Reagan, Karen Reagan. Is that what
[1:15:50] you're hearing? You're hearing your word
[1:15:53] name. When that word speaks to something
[1:15:56] that you finally found your true
[1:15:58] identity, maybe she's always an odd
[1:16:00] girl, 16 years old. Maybe she's always
[1:16:02] different and unusual and she didn't
[1:16:04] know what it was. But when she heard
[1:16:06] that prophecy, there was something about
[1:16:08] it. and through that angel's message.
[1:16:11] Hallelujah. And he told her, "This is
[1:16:13] the way it's going to be, Mary. You're
[1:16:15] not going to work your way into it.
[1:16:17] You're not going to pray your way into
[1:16:18] it. You're not going to fast your way
[1:16:20] into it. The Holy Ghost will come upon
[1:16:22] you." Let me tell you something, little
[1:16:24] bride. Yes. Pray. Read your Bible. God
[1:16:27] lays it on your heart to fast. Fast. But
[1:16:29] you're not going to get it by your
[1:16:30] works. You know how we're going to leave
[1:16:32] this world? The Holy Ghost is going to
[1:16:34] come upon us. The spirit of God will
[1:16:36] bring the power of the rapture. And it's
[1:16:39] been given to us by an angel's message.
[1:16:45] [applause]
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; And Mary said, "Behold, the handmade of
[1:16:54] the Lord, be it unto me according to thy
[1:16:58] word."
[1:17:00] She trusts him so much.
[1:17:04] Notice she didn't say the Torah.
[1:17:08] She didn't even quote Isaiah and say
[1:17:10] according to the book of Isaiah
[1:17:13] because Isaiah never personally
[1:17:15] identified her by name. Jenny, can you
[1:17:18] see it?
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Can't you see what God has done for you
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; by sending you a message in [screaming]
[1:17:28] the last day that would be so personal
[1:17:30] to you, you'll never get away from it. I
[1:17:32] don't care what you do, wherever you
[1:17:33] ever go.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; It's so personally to you. There's
[1:17:38] nothing.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Listen to me. The real bride in this age
[1:17:42] has it just as powerful as Mary had it
[1:17:45] then. Brother Daryl, you'll never talk
[1:17:47] them out of it. You'll never threaten
[1:17:49] them out of it. You'll never buy them
[1:17:50] out of it. They can't get out of it.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. [applause]
[1:17:58] Be it unto me
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; according to thy word.
[1:18:07] And they see all these lights
[1:18:11] and these saucers,
[1:18:13] flying saucers they call them,
[1:18:16] and they wonder what it is.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, little children.
[1:18:22] One of these days, one of them will drop
[1:18:25] right down into that
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; and change it. It won't be hide or hair
[1:18:30] nor bones left behind.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; You'll be changed in a moment.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Now, look with me again in Matthew 1:18.
[1:18:43] This is after the immaculate conception.
[1:18:49] Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on the
[1:18:51] with this wise one as his mother Mary
[1:18:53] was a spouse to Joseph before they came
[1:18:57] together and was she was found with
[1:19:00] child of the Holy Ghost. That's what I'm
[1:19:04] wanting everybody in this church this
[1:19:06] same portion of the word right here can
[1:19:09] be said about you
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; that you're found with child
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:17] Then Joseph, her husband, being a just
[1:19:19] man, not willing to make her a public
[1:19:21] example, but was minded to put her away
[1:19:25] private. Now remember, they were just
[1:19:26] engaged, betrothed, but the betroal was
[1:19:30] law-abbbinding.
[1:19:32] But while he thought on these things,
[1:19:35] behold,
[1:19:36] the angel of the Lord appeared unto him
[1:19:38] in a dream. I want you to notice how
[1:19:40] different that God comes to him than he
[1:19:44] did to Zachcharias or to Mary. He still
[1:19:48] sends an angel, but now it's an angel in
[1:19:52] a dream. And it's not a dream that needs
[1:19:55] interpretation. So, we don't look over
[1:19:57] here and there's three stars over there
[1:19:59] and there's four donkeys over there and
[1:20:01] there's five moon pies over here and six
[1:20:03] RC's and then there's a, you know, a
[1:20:04] little table that's got Tonka toys and
[1:20:06] and it's got all these symbols and all
[1:20:08] that. What did you eat for supper?
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. You can't believe some
[1:20:12] of the dreams that people send me
[1:20:13] sometime and they just know it means
[1:20:15] something. I know it means something,
[1:20:16] too. But it ain't got nothing to do with
[1:20:18] God. Come on, somebody. I know there's
[1:20:21] some of the people in the message just
[1:20:23] simply don't believe it. And the further
[1:20:24] we go, the more I I realize even some of
[1:20:27] the preachers in the message don't
[1:20:28] believe what the prophet said. That if
[1:20:30] it is a dream from God in this day,
[1:20:32] there is no prophet in the land to
[1:20:34] interpret it. So it will be a dream like
[1:20:37] Joseph had.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; the angel of the Lord appeared unto him
[1:20:45] in a dream, saying,
[1:20:48] Joseph,
[1:20:50] thou son of David, fear not to take unto
[1:20:54] thee Mary, thy wife.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Now, wait a minute. They're just
[1:21:00] engaged.
[1:21:03] Right.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; They've not even met under the tent yet.
[1:21:08] They've not even drank the last cup of
[1:21:10] wine. They She's not even been sent for
[1:21:12] to go to the house that he's built her.
[1:21:15] But the angel of God recognized betroal
[1:21:17] on that engagement. Binding?
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what Joseph is going
[1:21:22] to do? Divorce her?
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Fear not to take unto thee Mary
[1:21:30] thy wife of that which is conceived in
[1:21:33] her
[1:21:35] is of the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:37] And then Joseph wakes up and said, "Oh
[1:21:40] my goodness.
[1:21:42] Oh my goodness. What she's been telling
[1:21:44] me is the truth.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; I was having a hard time believing. I I
[1:21:48] just I just couldn't hardly believe."
[1:21:53] So the angel appeared to a bride.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; He did. And the bride conceived of the
[1:21:58] word and the bride was telling people
[1:22:00] about it, but a lot of the people was
[1:22:02] having a hard time believing it.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; That the bride had actually become
[1:22:08] pregnantated by the Holy Ghost. Praise
[1:22:09] the Lord, somebody.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Well, maybe the last call before the
[1:22:14] birth of the word in flesh will be some
[1:22:17] of those who struggling and the final
[1:22:20] voice to the final age will be the
[1:22:22] bride.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know some of our message folks
[1:22:25] don't like that quote. None. I love it
[1:22:27] myself cuz it reads me and you in the
[1:22:29] script.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, we're the last
[1:22:32] actors on the scene. Now watch verse 23.
[1:22:35] Quoting the scripture, behold, a virgin
[1:22:37] shall be with child and shall bring
[1:22:39] forth a son, and they shall call his
[1:22:41] name Emmanuel, which being interpreted
[1:22:43] is God with us. Then Joseph being raised
[1:22:47] from sleep
[1:22:49] did as the angel of the Lord had bidden
[1:22:52] him and took unto him his wife and knew
[1:22:58] her not till she had brought forth her
[1:23:02] firstborn son and called his name Jesus.
[1:23:07] So God appeared to him in this angel had
[1:23:10] formed and it was so real to Joseph. He
[1:23:14] done exactly what the angel said. Now
[1:23:17] watch in Matthew chapter 2 11. And when
[1:23:20] they were come, we're talking about the
[1:23:22] magi now. And they're coming after Jesus
[1:23:26] has been born.
[1:23:28] Actually a little while after Jesus had
[1:23:31] been born. That's right.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; And when they were come into the house,
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; not into the cavemen
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; where he was born,
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; they come into the house,
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; they saw
[1:23:51] the young child,
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; sir,
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; not a newborn baby.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; This is what your Bible says. That's
[1:23:59] right. Amen.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; They saw the young child with Mary his
[1:24:03] mother and fell down and worshiped him.
[1:24:05] And when they had opened their
[1:24:07] treasures, they presented unto him
[1:24:09] gifts, gold, and frankincense and myrr.
[1:24:11] And being warned of God in a dream that
[1:24:15] they should not return to Herod, they
[1:24:17] departed into their own country another
[1:24:20] way. And if you ever meet Jesus right
[1:24:24] and give him the proper gifts, you'll go
[1:24:26] back to your country another way than
[1:24:29] when the way you come to him. You come
[1:24:32] to him lost. You come to him wretched.
[1:24:34] You come to him in a mess. But when you
[1:24:36] meet him, oh, glory to God. I feel like
[1:24:38] preaching a little bit right now. And
[1:24:40] you give the Lord Jesus your gifts.
[1:24:43] Amen. He will send you back to your
[1:24:46] country another way than the way you
[1:24:48] come. Aren't you glad you're different,
[1:24:50] friends? You've been changed by the
[1:24:52] power of God. He's sending us another
[1:24:55] way.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; And when they were departed,
[1:25:05] behold,
[1:25:07] the angel of the Lord appearth to Joseph
[1:25:12] in a dream,
[1:25:15] saying, "Arise,
[1:25:18] and take the young child
[1:25:22] and his mother,
[1:25:24] and flee into Egypt.
[1:25:28] and be thou there until I
[1:25:31] bring thee word.
[1:25:34] So you imagine now an angel of God is
[1:25:37] bringing a message for him to flee.
[1:25:41] But the same angel ain't going to leave
[1:25:42] him there. The same angel will be sent
[1:25:45] back from the throne of God to tell him
[1:25:48] it's time to come back home
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; and there until I bring thee word for
[1:25:57] Herod will seek the young child to
[1:26:02] destroy him. Now notice after Herod was
[1:26:05] dead Matthew 21:19. But when Herod was
[1:26:08] dead, behold an angel of the Lord
[1:26:11] appearth in a dream. Ain't this
[1:26:13] something? Joseph has three visitations
[1:26:17] in his dream. His subconscience and it
[1:26:21] was an angel every time. We have no
[1:26:24] record that an angel actually appeared
[1:26:27] in a visible form. Now, some of you may
[1:26:30] be terrified of these things I've been
[1:26:31] preaching on Wednesday night thinking
[1:26:33] that an angel of God is going to appear
[1:26:34] before you. Don't worry. God knows
[1:26:36] exactly how to deal with each one of us.
[1:26:38] And God knows exactly how to make us.
[1:26:41] So, we're able to correspond to the
[1:26:42] supernatural. But this was just as much
[1:26:45] God as the other instances that
[1:26:48] happened. But this is the way God called
[1:26:50] Joseph. And this was his divine channel
[1:26:53] of communication by which God could
[1:26:56] speak to him. Praise the Lord. But when
[1:26:59] Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the
[1:27:01] Lord appears in a dream to Joseph and
[1:27:03] Egypt, saying, "Arise, and take the
[1:27:05] young child and his mother, and go into
[1:27:08] the land of Israel, for they are dead,
[1:27:10] which sought the young child's life."
[1:27:12] Now, let's move from from this to Luke
[1:27:15] 2:8. Look at all the angelic visitations
[1:27:19] that we've seen in a period of 6 months,
[1:27:23] a year, a year and a half, two years,
[1:27:27] one after another after another after
[1:27:31] another.
[1:27:33] It's a sign
[1:27:35] something's fixing to happen
[1:27:40] at the birth of Jesus.
[1:27:43] And they were in the same country
[1:27:45] shepherds
[1:27:47] abiding in the field, keeping watch over
[1:27:50] their flock by night. And lo, the angel
[1:27:57] [sighs]
[1:27:58] of the Lord came upon them.
[1:28:03] Now remember what these guys were.
[1:28:06] Humble, poor
[1:28:09] peasant
[1:28:10] shepherds.
[1:28:13] There was the kings, the potentates, the
[1:28:16] great high priest, the great holy s
[1:28:20] Sanhedrin.
[1:28:22] And God sent an angelic choir
[1:28:26] in order to sing to humble shepherds.
[1:28:31] Why? It had to be shepherds.
[1:28:36] And the angel of the Lord came upon
[1:28:38] them, and the glory of the Lord shone
[1:28:41] round about them. Can you imagine these
[1:28:43] guys? Nobody's, brother Darl. Absolute
[1:28:48] nobodies.
[1:28:50] And yet the angel of the Lord come upon
[1:28:52] them, and the glory of the Lord shone
[1:28:56] round about them, and they were sore
[1:28:59] afraid.
[1:29:01] And the angel said unto them, "Fear not,
[1:29:05] for behold, I bring you good tidings of
[1:29:07] great joy, which shall be to all people,
[1:29:12] for unto you is born this day in the
[1:29:16] city of David a Savior, which is Christ
[1:29:21] the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto
[1:29:25] you."
[1:29:27] Oh, you mean so an angel can tell you
[1:29:30] things that are to be
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; an angel can bring you things that are
[1:29:38] prophetic.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; This shall be a sign, oh hallelujah,
[1:29:44] unto you. You shall find the babe.
[1:29:48] Notice the difference of the terminology
[1:29:50] here, babe, versus the term in Matthew,
[1:29:53] child. Look at it in the Greek and
[1:29:55] you'll find out that the other one is an
[1:29:57] infant. It's not a baby. So, it's
[1:29:58] several years old. This shall be a sign
[1:30:01] unto you, and you'll find the babe
[1:30:04] wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a
[1:30:06] manger. It don't say about the magi
[1:30:09] finding him in swaddling clothes, lying
[1:30:10] in a manger. I know, I know, I know this
[1:30:13] is not tradition. I ain't worried about
[1:30:15] tradition. I want truth. You ain't going
[1:30:17] to find this in the manger scene. I've
[1:30:19] said it many years ago. You know, if I
[1:30:21] was going to have a modern-day major
[1:30:22] scene in front of my house, you know
[1:30:24] what I'd do? I'd get me a blowup
[1:30:26] mattress and go out there and lay in the
[1:30:27] yard and say, "Here it is. Right here is
[1:30:29] the current manger scene." Because deity
[1:30:31] ain't in heaven. It's in me. Deity ain't
[1:30:34] in heaven. It's in you. Jesus is no
[1:30:37] longer in a manger. I'm telling you,
[1:30:38] he's here in the bride's body. He's here
[1:30:41] in the blind flesh. But, brother Donnie,
[1:30:43] we're weak human beings. Yes, we are.
[1:30:46] And that's what makes it so awesome.
[1:30:49] That's what makes it so glorious.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; And this shall be a sign unto you. You
[1:30:58] shall find the babe wrapped in swirling
[1:31:00] clothes, lying in a manger.
[1:31:03] And suddenly there was with the angel a
[1:31:08] multitude
[1:31:09] of the heavenly host.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Praising God.
[1:31:15] Can you imagine them old boys looking
[1:31:17] around? Now keep in mind when they would
[1:31:19] go into town, everybody knew what these
[1:31:22] guys done cuz they smelled like sheep.
[1:31:25] They say that them shepherds was around
[1:31:27] the sheep so much that even when they
[1:31:29] laughed that their laugh was like a
[1:31:32] sheep.
[1:31:34] [laughter]
[1:31:36] [clears throat]
[1:31:38] Oh Lord God,
[1:31:41] can't you see why Jesus come to the
[1:31:43] earth?
[1:31:44] He wanted to learn to laugh like him.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; And them shepherds smelled like sheep.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; God in heaven in spirit form did not
[1:31:59] smell like a sheep.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; But Jesus wanted to come down to the
[1:32:04] earth and learn to laugh like us,
[1:32:08] but also learn to cry like us.
[1:32:12] Did the world need another carpenter?
[1:32:17] He who made the worlds?
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Did the world [screaming] need another
[1:32:23] fisherman?
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Him that would go out and cast a net
[1:32:26] into the sea and all he would had to
[1:32:28] have done was spoke to the sea and say,
[1:32:31] "Empty out."
[1:32:35] I'm talking about our father that could
[1:32:37] have put a patent on the seven colors in
[1:32:40] the rainbow. He could put a copyright on
[1:32:43] the Robin song. He could put a copyright
[1:32:46] on the cardinal song. He could put a
[1:32:48] patent and ownership on this and that
[1:32:51] and the other cuz it all belongs to him.
[1:32:54] Oh, hallelujah. Amen. And yet he come
[1:32:57] down to the earth and didn't even have a
[1:32:59] place to lay his sin. Had to borrow a
[1:33:02] womb to be born in. Had to borrow a
[1:33:04] grave to be buried in. But he ain't
[1:33:07] having to borrow nothing tonight. We
[1:33:09] give it to him. Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:33:11] We will not make him beg for our heart.
[1:33:15] We will not make him beg for room.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; We say, "Come in, Lord Jesus."
[1:33:29] Listen what they were singing now. Glory
[1:33:31] to God in the highest. On earth peace,
[1:33:36] good will toward men. It came to pass as
[1:33:39] the angels were gone away from them into
[1:33:41] heaven, the shepherds said one to
[1:33:43] another,
[1:33:45] "Let us now go even
[1:33:48] unto Bethlehem,
[1:33:50] and see this thing which
[1:33:53] is come to pass."
[1:33:56] Notice how they say it. Is come to pass.
[1:33:59] It's present tense. It's unfolding.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; It's coming to pass.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; They realized they were part of what was
[1:34:06] coming to pass. Oh Lord God, may I may
[1:34:09] we look tonight, Brother Joe, and see we
[1:34:11] are part of what is coming to pass. Yes,
[1:34:14] we are part of the past and we're part
[1:34:16] of the future, but we are part of the
[1:34:18] present. This is our time. We are the
[1:34:21] actors on the scene. Friends,
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; listen to this.
[1:34:32] Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and
[1:34:34] see this thing
[1:34:36] which has come to pass, which the Lord
[1:34:38] hath made known
[1:34:40] unto us.
[1:34:42] Listen to this. And there's a man can
[1:34:44] turn on the light. You know, when a king
[1:34:46] is born,
[1:34:48] they have seen
[1:34:51] great carrying on. When the king is
[1:34:54] born,
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; he was so secretly born, born in a
[1:34:58] stable in a manger where the cattle and
[1:35:00] the horses were eaten. But yet he was a
[1:35:03] king.
[1:35:05] And the angels came down
[1:35:08] and sang the hymns
[1:35:10] to the shepherds.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:35:16] So they didn't go to the temple
[1:35:20] and to sing to Annus and Capus,
[1:35:24] Pontius Pilate or Herod or whoever all
[1:35:26] the great people were of that day,
[1:35:29] but they went to shepherds.
[1:35:31] You see, God still believes in
[1:35:33] shepherds.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; And the angels came down and sang the
[1:35:44] hymns.
[1:35:47] I'm sorry. I know I think different, but
[1:35:49] as I was reading this, I thought, what
[1:35:51] hymns
[1:35:53] would it have been?
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; You imagine them poor guys that the rich
[1:36:00] wouldn't even speak to them. They would
[1:36:01] have nothing to do with them. And
[1:36:03] they're they're setting
[1:36:06] being entertained
[1:36:08] by angels.
[1:36:12] They were the audience
[1:36:14] to hear the songs at the king's birth.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; So if there's a choir director in the
[1:36:22] angelic band and him getting his stick
[1:36:24] or whatever they did and him said, "All
[1:36:26] right, ready
[1:36:29] everybody ready on a capella now." Or
[1:36:31] they might have harps and horns. I'm not
[1:36:33] sure. Oh Lord have mercy. That'd kill a
[1:36:35] church of Christ, wouldn't it? Dear God,
[1:36:36] to think that instruments up in heaven.
[1:36:41] But there they say the the the shepherds
[1:36:43] around said,
[1:36:45] "Where's the audience?"
[1:36:48] You all are.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; But we've never even been to a concert.
[1:36:56] Most of the time we're not allowed to go
[1:36:58] in church cuz we we ain't got very good
[1:37:00] clothes.
[1:37:03] But today you are going to be serenated
[1:37:06] by the angelic host and you will hear
[1:37:08] hymns which have never been sang before.
[1:37:14] You imagine I'm just sitting there
[1:37:15] looking one said ain't this something?
[1:37:19] Can you believe this?
[1:37:22] Who we going to tell this to?
[1:37:25] Who in the world are we going to Nobody
[1:37:28] ever believe this is happening to us? I
[1:37:30] kind of feel the same way. Sometimes
[1:37:32] they'll choose that. Who in the world we
[1:37:33] going to tell this to? We trying to tell
[1:37:34] them. They look at us and think, "Yeah,
[1:37:36] right." You know, like he got five
[1:37:37] heads. What in the world? You people
[1:37:39] think y'all Yeah, right. Uh-huh. You
[1:37:41] know what? What you been drinking?
[1:37:42] Better watch that guy. He's got that
[1:37:43] blue Kool-Aid. Oh, no. This is kind of
[1:37:44] purple. You better watch him. He'll be
[1:37:46] handing that Kool-Aid. I'm the only one
[1:37:48] that drinks here.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Okay. We don't hand out this cup. So, if
[1:37:52] it's going to kill anybody, it's going
[1:37:53] to kill me. But they look at us and
[1:37:55] think, "Oh, come on now." You imagine
[1:37:56] them guys think, "Is this happening?"
[1:37:59] Right.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Are are we really invited
[1:38:06] into the presence of angels?
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Could it be true
[1:38:15] since it's the very day you took your
[1:38:17] first breath of life on the earth?
[1:38:21] God had an angel assigned to you.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; And another one which looks like you
[1:38:28] before the throne of God.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Remember when Peter was in jail
[1:38:33] and wrote and went to the door,
[1:38:36] they prayed that God would set him free
[1:38:38] and God set him free and then they
[1:38:40] didn't believe God answered their
[1:38:41] prayers.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Remember that in the book of Acts?
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; So poor Roa goes to the door and Peter
[1:38:46] knocks on the door and I mean she just
[1:38:47] about has a spell. She goes back to
[1:38:49] town. Peter's at the door. They said,
[1:38:51] "You're crazy."
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; She's telling them their prayers are
[1:38:54] answered. Said, "God ain't answering our
[1:38:55] prayers already. Don't tell us that
[1:38:57] girl."
[1:38:58] But you know what they said?
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; It is his angel.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Because they believed each person had an
[1:39:09] angel that looked like them.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:14] So they thought Peter had died
[1:39:19] and it was his angel.
[1:39:22] Listen to this.
[1:39:24] The angels themselves were lights that
[1:39:27] had showed the word of God. They had the
[1:39:29] word of God and told them, "Today in the
[1:39:31] city of David in Bethlehem is born
[1:39:33] Christ the Savior." The angels had the
[1:39:35] word and the word came by light to
[1:39:37] guide.
[1:39:39] They followed the word of the angels to
[1:39:42] eternal life.
[1:39:44] And I say I may I say unto you tonight,
[1:39:48] we're getting closer to the Christmas
[1:39:49] time so-called.
[1:39:52] And we know the scripture says that they
[1:39:55] come and said we have seen his star in
[1:39:57] the east and we have come to worship
[1:40:00] him. But let me update that.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; We have seen his star in the west.
[1:40:08] And we have come to worship him,
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; not the star.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Anybody that says we worship William
[1:40:15] Brandham is a liar
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; and will go to hell
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; if they do not repent of such nonsense.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; We pray in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:40:26] We worship the Lord Jesus. You're fixing
[1:40:29] to see me in a little bit. Baptize in
[1:40:31] the name of the Lord Jesus. He is our
[1:40:35] God. But we have seen his star in the
[1:40:39] west and we come to worship him,
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; the Lord Jesus,
[1:40:46] not the messenger. [applause]
[1:40:51] Let me close. You haven't listened to
[1:40:53] this one in a while. You ought to listen
[1:40:56] to it. Why it had to be shepherds.
[1:41:00] Notice God is fixing to make another
[1:41:03] creation.
[1:41:05] He's creating mortal earth, mortal life.
[1:41:11] Angels sing in heaven. But here he's
[1:41:14] creating a new life,
[1:41:18] eternal life for man.
[1:41:23] [laughter]
[1:41:26] And he's singing
[1:41:30] to his subjects
[1:41:33] through angels.
[1:41:38] Did not the prophet of the Old Testament
[1:41:40] say, "I will sing unto you."
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Here was God
[1:41:49] singing to shepherds,
[1:41:52] through angels.
[1:41:54] He's singing to his subjects
[1:41:58] through angels on the earth,
[1:42:01] not in heaven. Heaven had eternal life.
[1:42:05] And he's saying, they sang to the
[1:42:08] heavens.
[1:42:10] And here the immortal creation is coming
[1:42:12] in.
[1:42:14] And now they're singing to earthly
[1:42:16] people
[1:42:18] the first time
[1:42:21] to shepherds.
[1:42:23] Striking, isn't it?
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; He had started a new creation.
[1:42:29] What was it? A creation
[1:42:33] of himself.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; God was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[1:42:39] The Bible said in the beginning of the
[1:42:41] creation of God, God was created
[1:42:45] in human form
[1:42:48] and Jesus Christ his son.
[1:42:52] God dwelt. He built his tabernacle of
[1:42:54] flesh and bones and lived in that
[1:42:56] tabernacle. God, Emmanuel, God with us.
[1:43:01] He built himself a house to live in it
[1:43:04] so he could reflect his word to his
[1:43:06] subjects through that. You know what God
[1:43:10] is
[1:43:12] when you see Christ.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Stand up.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:23] [applause]
[1:43:36] One of these days
[1:43:39] he'll probably let us look back and see
[1:43:44] your mother was carrying you in the
[1:43:46] womb.
[1:43:49] The doctor said he or she will never
[1:43:51] live
[1:43:53] or never survive. There's something
[1:43:54] going on this is that and the other. You
[1:43:56] might as well get ready for it.
[1:43:59] But God had ordained you to be on this
[1:44:01] earth to express his love.
[1:44:06] Elelliana sent here tonight when Erica
[1:44:08] was carrying her and Emma. The doctor
[1:44:11] gave us all kinds of bad reports.
[1:44:14] Wasn't sure that Ellie would ever live.
[1:44:17] the way they were conceived and the way
[1:44:19] their mama was carrying them.
[1:44:22] Emma was pulling a lot of the nutrients
[1:44:24] and things away from Ellie. Wasn't your
[1:44:26] fault, honey. You wasn't doing it on
[1:44:27] purpose.
[1:44:32] But we prayed and we believed and we
[1:44:34] trusted.
[1:44:36] No doubt the angel of the god of God
[1:44:38] come in. How many of you almost had a
[1:44:41] car wreck? You was heading so and so and
[1:44:44] something happened in the house and you
[1:44:45] was delayed five minutes and you got
[1:44:47] down the road and there was a tractor
[1:44:48] and trailer and people sprawled all over
[1:44:50] the road and the angel of God got in
[1:44:53] your way.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; All of them.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:05] Hallelujah.
[1:45:08] He sends his angels
[1:45:11] to prepare the way before us.
[1:45:15] Hallelujah.
[1:45:17] Remember
[1:45:19] this is your identity
[1:45:21] of who you are. You're more than a
[1:45:24] carnal man or woman.
[1:45:28] That's only this part.
[1:45:33] all night and all day.
[1:45:37] They watch over you.
[1:45:41] They care for you.
[1:45:43] That care doesn't mean they keep you
[1:45:45] from all trouble. But sometimes that
[1:45:48] care means they help you through the
[1:45:50] deepest and darkest trials of life.
[1:45:55] And in the middle of it, you look at it
[1:45:56] and think, I'll never be able to get
[1:45:58] through it. And you are actually talking
[1:46:00] the truth.
[1:46:02] But God gives you an angelic visitation.
[1:46:07] We'll get to it. But I found in setting
[1:46:09] more on on angels this week
[1:46:12] that the prophet says that there was
[1:46:14] actually
[1:46:15] angels of healing.
[1:46:19] Angels of healing. And he describes the
[1:46:22] angel that was sent down to the pool of
[1:46:25] Saleom.
[1:46:27] They would go there to the pool and the
[1:46:30] angel would get down in the water and he
[1:46:32] would trouble the water. And the word
[1:46:34] trouble there is bubble.
[1:46:37] So there's all kind of people laying
[1:46:38] around it and God would send this maybe
[1:46:41] the same angel in this certain season.
[1:46:43] We don't know how often and the first
[1:46:46] person inside that water would be
[1:46:49] healed. Aren't you glad we don't have to
[1:46:50] wait for the seasons to come? Hell
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; remember the prophet talking about the
[1:46:57] two women that come to his meeting
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; one of them had a real bad stomach
[1:47:01] trouble couldn't eat the other one had a
[1:47:04] tumor both of them was prayed for left
[1:47:07] off believed God kept having same old
[1:47:10] symptoms same old symptoms kept
[1:47:12] confessing the word by a strip some
[1:47:14] healed
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; the one sister got up fixed the
[1:47:17] breakfast for her kids little oatmeal
[1:47:20] left over and she just felt
[1:47:25] She just felt a little something nudge
[1:47:27] her. Uhhuh. That's what I'm talking
[1:47:29] about.
[1:47:31] Eat that oatmeal. She thought if I do,
[1:47:34] it'll make me sick. It always burn my
[1:47:35] stomach. But she ate that oatmeal. Give
[1:47:39] it a little bit of time. Oh, now I It'll
[1:47:41] probably make me sick again just in a
[1:47:42] few minutes. It didn't do it. She ate a
[1:47:46] little more. She had a piece of toast
[1:47:48] and prophet said she got some eggs and
[1:47:49] did this and had a gastronomical
[1:47:51] jubilee.
[1:47:53] Her sister friend lived right down the
[1:47:55] road. They live in the same
[1:47:57] neighborhood.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; She had a tumor.
[1:48:02] So she went down to tell her sister
[1:48:04] friend about it. She knocked on the door
[1:48:06] and she heard that sister screaming and
[1:48:08] shouting and hollering. She just opened
[1:48:11] the door and went on in. She said,
[1:48:13] "What's wrong? What's going on?"
[1:48:15] She said that tumor fell off
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; and she was shaking the sheets looking
[1:48:20] for it.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; And a man
[1:48:28] who had dealt with angels since he was a
[1:48:30] boy
[1:48:31] said the angel of the Lord,
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; was just able to pass through their
[1:48:36] community that morning.
[1:48:40] And he said, "Now what if they would
[1:48:41] have give up the night before?
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Then the angel would have went somewhere
[1:48:45] else."
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the angel of God having
[1:48:49] such a busy schedule? That's a faith
[1:48:52] church. You understand? For some
[1:48:54] churches, he's got plenty of time.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; They don't believe in miracles. They
[1:48:58] don't believe God can do that. We want
[1:49:00] to be the kind of church that we make
[1:49:02] our angels work overtime.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; They got to work on Sunday. They got to
[1:49:07] work on New Year's. They got to work on
[1:49:09] Christmas. They don't never get a
[1:49:10] holiday. [laughter]
[1:49:12] They don't never get a day off because
[1:49:14] we believe God. [screaming]
[1:49:16] We believe our God does the same thing
[1:49:18] that he's already done. He can never
[1:49:22] change.
[1:49:25] So the angel of the Lord passed by her
[1:49:27] house, healed her, passed by the other,
[1:49:29] and healed her, and kept right on going
[1:49:32] where going where? from one house to
[1:49:34] another to another looking for faith
[1:49:36] people, looking for Rahab people,
[1:49:38] looking for token people, looking for
[1:49:40] people that had their faith anointed by
[1:49:42] the spirit of God. And he had to make a
[1:49:44] stop. Make a stop. Make a stop. Make a
[1:49:46] stop. Praise be to God.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you love him, children?
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[1:49:59] Let's bow our heads together.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus,
[1:50:11] thank you for allowing us, Lord,
[1:50:15] to live in this last day.
[1:50:18] It would have been an awesome time to
[1:50:20] live in the days of Noah. And if I'd
[1:50:23] been one of his sons, I'd have packed
[1:50:25] the pitch. and I like doing woodworking.
[1:50:28] So, no doubt I'd been in there working
[1:50:31] this and cutting that and sharpening
[1:50:34] that and doing something else. If I'd
[1:50:37] have lived in the days of Enoch, I'd
[1:50:38] have no doubt I'd been inside the
[1:50:40] pyramids and doing something else. And
[1:50:43] if I'd have lived in the days of
[1:50:45] Nehemiah, I'd been building the stones
[1:50:46] and reshaping this and that and the
[1:50:49] other.
[1:50:50] But you let me live in this day.
[1:50:54] I'm still a builder.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; I'm doing the best that I know to try to
[1:50:59] take your word
[1:51:01] and help build a character in your
[1:51:03] people.
[1:51:05] Lord God, those that you've given to my
[1:51:07] charge
[1:51:09] to try to help build them into a stature
[1:51:14] of a perfect man,
[1:51:17] Lord. And many of these
[1:51:21] sons and daughters
[1:51:23] lived in the days of Noah that had got
[1:51:26] on board the ark. In the days of
[1:51:29] Nehemiah, they'd been right there
[1:51:30] helping. In the days of Luther, they'd
[1:51:33] believe justification. Days of Wesley,
[1:51:34] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[1:51:36] Ghost, and the days of the Pentecostals.
[1:51:38] Because no matter what age you would
[1:51:40] have put us, we'd been believers. No
[1:51:42] question about it.
[1:51:44] Because that's who we were before the
[1:51:46] foundation of the world.
[1:51:48] Lord God, I pray you'd make us more
[1:51:50] conscious
[1:51:52] on the level, Father, that were called
[1:51:54] to walk into it. I'm not made to be able
[1:51:57] to deal in that realm that your prophet
[1:51:59] did. There may be men on the earth today
[1:52:03] that are called and privileged by you to
[1:52:05] deal in a realm with the angels of God
[1:52:07] and the supernatural and that sort of
[1:52:08] thing that I'll never be able to, Lord.
[1:52:13] But I want all that I can.
[1:52:16] I want everything that's in my ordained
[1:52:18] capacity.
[1:52:20] Oh Jesus, we worship you tonight,
[1:52:23] Father.
[1:52:25] We bless your name tonight, Father.
[1:52:29] Hallelujah.
[1:52:32] May the angels of God spread their wings
[1:52:34] over this place tonight
[1:52:37] and distill drops of salvation, if
[1:52:41] there's any that's lost. May those
[1:52:44] distilled drops of purity and holiness
[1:52:49] fall upon a heart.
[1:52:51] Lord, if there's any that's sick, may
[1:52:53] the heal the healing angels
[1:52:56] pass by this way tonight.
[1:52:59] Lord, I know there's so many needs among
[1:53:01] your children anymore. It becomes
[1:53:02] overwhelming
[1:53:04] and it may overwhelm me. It may
[1:53:05] overwhelm Brother Daryl. It may
[1:53:07] overwhelm us as mortals, but it don't
[1:53:10] overwhelm them angels if we'll just be
[1:53:12] patient. they will show up and they're
[1:53:16] looking for faith.
[1:53:18] Lord God, we want to live in the right
[1:53:20] community. I ain't talking about a
[1:53:23] certain subdivision here in this life in
[1:53:25] Johnson City. I'm talking about the
[1:53:28] community of the saints of God,
[1:53:32] seated in heavenly places
[1:53:35] in Christ Jesus. There's many sick among
[1:53:38] our people, Lord. Different ones
[1:53:40] fighting different things. Father, I'm
[1:53:42] asking you that you'll just be mindful
[1:53:44] of every one of them. Some streaming
[1:53:45] tonight, no doubt, have different needs
[1:53:47] in their body. May the angel of God pass
[1:53:50] by. Those that are sick at home,
[1:53:52] couldn't be in service. May the angels
[1:53:54] of God come this way tonight, Father.
[1:53:58] That one who troubled the water there
[1:53:59] that day, no doubt he's still troubling
[1:54:02] the water and troubling the devil, too,
[1:54:05] cuz he passes by and makes the tumors
[1:54:09] fall off.
[1:54:11] Hallelujah.
[1:54:14] He passes by and cures that stomach
[1:54:17] trouble. He takes care of the blood
[1:54:20] pressure. Whether it's high or low,
[1:54:22] makes him no difference. We're needy
[1:54:24] tonight, Father. May the angels of the
[1:54:27] Lord, I know they're here. It's your
[1:54:30] promise.
[1:54:32] It's your promise, Lord. Your prophet
[1:54:35] said there was something sacred about a
[1:54:37] church. As a matter of fact, he said it
[1:54:39] was his favorite place to preach.
[1:54:42] He preferred preaching in churches
[1:54:45] because he said around them auditoriums
[1:54:48] there was wicked angels.
[1:54:52] Wicked angels that hung around them
[1:54:56] auditoriums. But he said there was
[1:54:58] something special about a church. And he
[1:55:00] said it was his favorite place to be in
[1:55:04] church.
[1:55:06] Well, Lord, it's ours, too.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; It's ours, too. Oh, sure. You met us at
[1:55:11] Walmart. Oh, yeah. You You met us at
[1:55:13] Lowe's. You met me this morning, Lord. I
[1:55:17] want to thank you for it.
[1:55:20] You seen that text I got last night,
[1:55:22] Lord. And I was so troubled about it,
[1:55:24] and I didn't know how to answer it,
[1:55:26] Lord.
[1:55:27] It's just been weighing on me and
[1:55:29] weighing on me and I didn't know what to
[1:55:32] say exactly,
[1:55:34] but you visited me, Lord, and I thank
[1:55:36] you for it.
[1:55:39] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:55:42] Help the people to see this is not just
[1:55:44] a preacher privilege. You want to visit
[1:55:47] them as they're driving to work. The
[1:55:50] sisters as they're making beds and
[1:55:52] fixing breakfast.
[1:55:54] It ain't just the preachers that are
[1:55:55] loved. May each one of them be able to
[1:55:58] see tonight. The same angel could speak
[1:56:01] to every child of God here in this place
[1:56:03] and say, "You are highly favored. You
[1:56:06] have found favor with God.
[1:56:11] We worship you tonight, Jesus.
[1:56:15] Oh, bless your name, Father.
[1:56:18] Sing a little something for us, Harris.
[1:56:20] We worship the Lord. We have a baptism
[1:56:23] tonight if they'll come and prepare for
[1:56:25] that. Brother Daryl, maybe you can come,
[1:56:27] brother, while they sing. And just give
[1:56:30] me a little bit of time to prepare.
[1:56:32] Ain't it been good to be in the house of
[1:56:34] God?
[1:56:36] [applause]
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; How many of me wants to be more
[1:56:45] conscious of that world around you?
[1:56:48] Brother Donnie, I I couldn't stand an
[1:56:49] angel. I couldn't. Don't worry, friends.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Mary probably thought the same thing.
[1:56:54] She had to be told, "Fear not."
[1:56:59] And for most of us, we'll never have
[1:57:01] that happen to us.
[1:57:03] And a lot of your angelic visitations,
[1:57:05] more than likely, they will be
[1:57:07] invisible. They will come,
[1:57:11] they will do their work,
[1:57:14] and they will pull out of your sphere,
[1:57:16] and you'll be better, and you'll never
[1:57:19] see them.
[1:57:22] But I think I think why God is saying
[1:57:24] these things to us
[1:57:26] is that he wants us to know
[1:57:29] what's around us. But brother Donnie,
[1:57:32] we're no good and we're we're poor and
[1:57:33] we're
[1:57:35] Yeah, I understand why it had to be
[1:57:38] shepherds.
[1:57:40] We're not rich. We're [clears throat]
[1:57:41] not famous. We're not No.
[1:57:47] But you reckon they let that whole thing
[1:57:48] interrupt that singing? Oh, I'm not good
[1:57:50] enough. I'm not good enough. I I I can't
[1:57:52] I can't listen to this. My ears ain't
[1:57:54] holy enough. No, my hands ain't holy
[1:57:56] enough. No. No. But they had to accept
[1:57:58] what the angel said.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; So when he went to that cross,
[1:58:10] somehow God
[1:58:13] made me pay for my sins
[1:58:17] in his body. Then
[1:58:22] that's what your prophet said.
[1:58:27] Demonology part two, paragraph 199.
[1:58:31] And I think of how that when Jesus died,
[1:58:36] God sent him to hell
[1:58:39] because of his sins.
[1:58:44] But he never had any
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; of his own.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; But he took yours
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; and he took mine. And he took them so
[1:58:55] completely
[1:58:56] God judged him guilty of them. Yeah.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; The second Adam come to stand in proxy.
[1:59:05] The first Adam forfeited your eternal
[1:59:07] life. The second Adam brought it back to
[1:59:10] you.
[1:59:13] Don't you love him?
[1:59:16] Let's just worship it beloved together.
[1:59:19] Here
[1:59:20] we are
[1:59:26] [music]
[1:59:27] in your presence. [singing]
[1:59:33] [music]
[1:59:35] Lifting holy [singing]
[1:59:39] hands
[1:59:40] [music] to you.
[1:59:48] [music]
[1:59:50] Here [singing] we are [music]
[1:59:58] praising [singing] Jesus. [music]
[2:00:05] for [singing] the things [music]
[2:00:08] he's brought us through.
[2:00:14] Thank you, Lord Jesus. [music]
[2:00:15] Well, let's just worship you.
[2:00:20] Here [singing] we are
[2:00:26] [music]
[2:00:27] in [singing]
[2:00:28] your presence.
[2:00:33] We love you.
[2:00:35] Lifting holy [singing]
[2:00:38] hands
[2:00:40] to you.
[2:00:42] [singing]
[2:00:44] [music]
[2:00:46] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:00:49] Here we are
[2:00:56] praising [music]
[2:00:58] Jesus.
[2:01:00] [singing]
[2:01:03] for the things [music]
[2:01:06] [singing]
[2:01:07] he's brought us through. [music]
[2:01:14] Hallelujah.
[2:01:15] What a great honor.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Our little brother has been so troubled
[2:01:20] about baptism. He said he couldn't wait
[2:01:22] till Sunday. He did not want to wait.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; I like it when God so gets a hold of
[2:01:27] somebody's heart, they can't wait.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what's going on? The
[2:01:32] angels are still working.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, what a great honor it is for
[2:01:40] us, Father.
[2:01:43] How we worship you and thank you. Thank
[2:01:47] you for dealing with our young children.
[2:01:49] Lord, we hear news all the time of a
[2:01:52] sevenyear-old, an 8-year-old, a
[2:01:54] 10year-old, all different ones shooting
[2:01:56] people, packing guns, doing all kinds of
[2:01:58] crazy stuff.
[2:02:00] The devil is going younger and younger
[2:02:03] to get his. Why would we want to limit
[2:02:05] you from doing the same thing? [snorts]
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; Father, I pray you'd deal with my little
[2:02:10] brother's heart. I can baptize him
[2:02:12] tonight in water, but only you can take
[2:02:14] his little soul and fill him with the
[2:02:16] Holy Ghost. Lord,
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; may you be with him, Lord. Keep him by
[2:02:20] your grace. Father, I pray in the name
[2:02:23] of Jesus. My little brother, in
[2:02:26] obedience to his word, I baptize you in
[2:02:29] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:02:35] [applause]
[2:02:42] [applause]
[2:02:45] Thank you, Lord.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; Hey, just something about a water
[2:02:48] baptism, it makes you want to do it
[2:02:50] again. [laughter]
[2:02:51] Amen.
[2:02:53] Aren't you glad to be a part of the
[2:02:55] economy of God?
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; Can you
[2:02:59] accept and believe what the angel has
[2:03:03] said about you?
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not Luther's day, not Wesley's
[2:03:07] day, but your day, your time, your
[2:03:09] season, your hour, your manifestation of
[2:03:12] the word of God that's spoken concerning
[2:03:14] you. Amen. Every word of God will be
[2:03:16] manifested.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; None of his word will return unto him
[2:03:20] void. And we're a part of that word. Do
[2:03:22] you believe that this evening?
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. You can see why
[2:03:25] the devil tried to sting him with a
[2:03:27] wasp. Amen. That's some good preaching
[2:03:30] right there.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God. May the Lord bless our
[2:03:34] precious brother Donnie and strengthen
[2:03:36] him and take care of that sting on his
[2:03:38] finger. We just love him tonight. Let's
[2:03:41] just sing one more before we go. Can we,
[2:03:42] brother Harry? Just whatever is on your
[2:03:44] heart, brother.
[2:03:48] [music]
[2:03:52] Praise the Lord. God bless you, saints.

[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't he wonderful? [music] Let's
[2:08:06] just bow our heads.
[2:08:10] Almighty God,
[2:08:13] [snorts]
[2:08:15] we Lord bow in your wonderful presence
[2:08:20] with thanksgiving in our hearts, oh
[2:08:22] Lord, for what thou has done for us,
[2:08:24] Lord. [snorts]
[2:08:27] And God, we are so grateful, Lord, that
[2:08:29] we can see [snorts]
[2:08:32] oursel in your word, Lord.
[2:08:35] For it's written, our God spoken through
[2:08:38] the prophet
[2:08:40] that Jesus had perfect faith because he
