every step oh I surrender [Music] all I surrender all I surrender all all to thee my blessed savior I surrender [Music] all all I am all I have I give it back to you every breath every step oh I [Music] surrender [Music] [Applause] [Music] all what a great desire to be able to surrender all to him many of you have been saved for many many years no doubt you're still learning how to surrender more to him aren't you myself I've been saved the majority of my life and about the time you think you think you've got everything surrendered there's something else that you know you have to give up this or that or the other not necessarily sin just opinions ideologies that you have things that you think the Lord would never take from you and yet he does because you realize Paul said the troubles and things that we go through in this life are not even worthy to be compared to the glory that shall be revealed in us at that day to claim the title of being bride it's quite a claim it's an honor for sure but that also means it puts us in a category that's different than a lot of people there's millions of Christian Believers as we would say on the Earth today but I wonder how many of them are disciples a Believer and a disciple is not the same thing the word disciple comes from the word discipline so the bride can be disciplined lot the Believers today oh I believe in the Lord I Want to Go to Heaven I don't want to go to hell I believe in Mercy I believe in grace I believe in all of that but you don't need to wear them clothes now wait a minute don't tell me how I've got a dress don't tell me I can't do this so where do they severs discipline discipline if you have a desire today to be disciplined by almighty God you are a blessed individual if he tells you no you just don't do it that's right because you know that he knows best and if he takes something from you that is so dear and you're trying your best to hold on to it and he still takes it that's when it gets hard to say he knows best how many wants that with all your heart all your heart that's rapturing material friends we've made rapturing material this doctrine that Doctrine this theology this move that move but it's a character that'll match the Lord Jesus that's the kind of people he's going to take from the earth those who are perfect match of him it's like he's been letting these secrets out for thousands and thousands of years it's his own personal desire and his own personal requirement this is who my bride will be she'll be like this she'll be like that she'll be like this she'll be like that and there's something in every believer that wants to be what he wants sometimes you don't even know what it is yet but it's a desire we have been so blessed the last couple of days that we want to thank our brother Nathan Ericson for coming to be with us and studying and applying himself and follow the leading of the Lord have you young people been blessed amen even those of us who can no longer be identified as young people have also been blessed that's right cuz it's something that we can take home with us something that'll make us uh different people what the Lord wants us to be so last service and we're just asking the Lord that he'll come once again and use our brother help us to be able to pull on the gift of God help him to be able to get out of the way and remember no matter what you're facing what you're dealing with today if God can speak to your heart whether it's a disease it's incurable whether it's a sickness or whether it's something in your home your family your life all you need is that Revelation from the Lord and it can solve that question for you today let's just reach out to him as we touch him we'll invite our brother to come hey let's sing touching Jesus no matter how much you've been around the message how many years that you've studied it and what you think you know up here don't ever get away from the simple ability given to you by God to be able to touch Jesus many of the people in the New Testament that touched him they were not great renowned people they were not theologians they were not people that the majority of the world would even pay any attention to them they may not have but Jesus did so whatever you need today reach out to him oh woman tried so many Physicians help me sing it now yet grew worse so to Jesus she [Music] came and when that crowd tried to restrain her she whispered these words through all her pain everybody now oh touching Jesus is all you believe it that's all that matters your heartaches your troubles and your life life will never be the [Laughter] same for there's only one way thank you Jesus oh you must be Hallelujah let's sing it again with all of our hearts may your heart be an open Channel touching [Music] Jesus that [Music] really there's only one way to touch [Music] him just believe when you call on his name let's sing that one more time oh touching Jesus that's all that really matters and then your life will never be the same oh and there's only one way to touch him just believe when you call on his name amen amen that's certainly our desire this morning amen I want to say God bless you uh it's a real honor to stand before you this morning and uh and uh we just uh appreciate the opportunity to be here amen and and grateful for what the Lord has done this weekend amen it's just been uh one of the great honors of my life really Amen to preach here to your young people uh the the Youth of this message are very near and dear to my heart amen and I I've just made it part of my life's work to try to be a blessing to them and facilitate what the Lord is doing bringing Revival to a new generation some of you older ones back there maybe you've you've uh there's been a lot of water under the bridge you know a lot of things have transpired around the community of message Believers uh and maybe over the years you've built up a little bit of discouragement amen maybe you built up uh just a uh a little bit of hopelessness uh in your heart because of things that have happened but if you want to find Hope look at what God is doing in this Young Generation amen because the message has not diminished amen it has not stopped amen it's advancing forward amen as God is calling and forming Out of the Dust of this Earth another generation of Champions and he's raising up young men young women amen that uh that if if if uh if if we all were to pass away there will be a Young Generation that will sweep this message on to the coming of the Lord amen amen if you want to turn with me to Isaiah chapter 55 I want to greet the church again for our pastor brother Wayne lawon Amen I know that his ministry is familiar to you and amen and we're just uh we're just uh appreciative of the Lord sending them our way there to Ohio to those of us at True Word Tabernacle there's a lot of family connections here and friendships uh so I want to greet you for all of True Word Tabernacle amen uh just uh one of the loveliest groups of people you'll ever meet and uh so it's really I'm privileged to just represent them today and hope that I've represented them as well this weekend amen we're just a we're just a place where the message worked amen and you'll find out as you know that anywhere the message that this word is given preeminence it works amen so we greet you for True Word Tabernacle brother Andrew Glover I know has family and friends here and and he's preaching for us back home spoke to him this morning and uh greet you for him as well Isaiah chap 55 and I'd like to read verses 8 to 11 then we'll turn to Luke 24 and pick up a few scriptures on the road to Emmas the word says for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saeth the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but WTH the Earth and maketh it bring forth and Bud that it may give seed to the swer and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it hallelujah amen Luke chapter 24 and we'll start at verse 25 come down to about 32 and of course we know the story of the road to Emmas as Jesus walked with his disciples and and Jesus said to them oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself and they drew nigh unto the village with they went and he made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to T with them and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and break and gave to them and their eyes were open and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures amen let's pray heavenly father that's our desire the this morning Lord that you would just come our way and walk with us a little while Lord and as you expound to us the scriptures father I pray Lord that your quickening power would come amongst us Lord and Lord somewhere between Lord the lips of the speaker and the ear of the hearer May the word become a living thing father Lord may it become a fire that would ignite faith in every heart Lord to believe Lord uh the word for our day Lord to see the picture right Lord and not to look at the discouraging things going on father but to find Our Hope and find our peace in the things which are promised for our day Lord it'll only take place if you would come and dwell with us Lord and break the bread of life to us be The Interpreter of your word I pray Lord and it'll make our hearts burn within us come Lord we want to touch you we want to hear your voice so we invite you now Lord and not only invite you but we want to make you welcome come and take control in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you seated amen I'd like to preach a sermon to you by the help of the Lord today I'd like to title it the word speaks for itself the word speaks for itself amen and brother Brandon would uh take us to the road to Emmas in the message events made clear by prophecy amen and uh and and I love the way that he would explain it he says he he he draws the picture in this way he says we watch here the word itself quoting the word of himself isn't that amazing it's the word he was the word itself quoting the word of himself amen and and uh he said it's he didn't just come right it's amazing the way the Lord Works he didn't just come right out and tell him that he was that but he let the word speak for itself amen he let the word speak for itself and then they knew who he was now he says this was the word in flesh quoting the word of the letter being fully identified with himself and he says look here now let's listen to him quote amen and amen that's that's what we love uh that's what that's what we long to see take place amen is for the presence of the Lord to come in such a way that he would he would take flesh in this hour amen and that we would not just be uh quoting scriptures and quotes in vain repetition amen but that the word itself would take flesh and it would be the word quoting the word of itself amen we want we want it to speak for itself we want there to be a voice behind our voice amen uh We've uh you know this message has come a long way a long span of time amen and and uh many of you were there from the beginning when it was when it was young and it was fresh and it was a new thing and and now down through a period of time there's a lot of things that have transpired churches have been built and and movements you know and and Ministries have risen and fallen and amen Family Lines have carried on and all these kind of things and we use words around the message that we didn't use before we talk about leges and we talk about we talk about history and we talk about you know we talk about things that happened in the past and things have gone on a little bit of a while and so there's a lot of things that we can look at there's a lot of things that you know a lot of things to be done a lot of things to be said and just a lot of experiences that we've had but there's one thing amen that makes our hearts burn within us is when the Lord comes and makes this message manifest Among Us amen when he vindicates it to be true amen not just when we talk about it not just when we go to a message church not just CU you know not just because we accept it as a lifestyle or a tradition or or a new Creed but when amen when it proves itself among us to be true it causes our hearts to burn within us because we recognize that this message is not just another movement amen or another group or another denomination but it's Christ amen it's Christ revealed Among Us and in US amen and and doing the Greater Works through the Bride of Jesus Christ and so amen that's what that's what causes the True Believer amen that's what causes something to LEAP up in the heart that will burn amen a a passion and and an ignition amen a uh a a revelation a quickening amen of uh of uh of the word and so and so uh I love this story of the road to Emmas because it it it just uh you know it just Catches Us at every point in our journey how that they these two disciples they're real sincere Believers but they're looking at the picture all wrong and they got they got all they're looking at all the world events and you know they're looking at how the Sun is just blacked out and their Earth Shook and amen and and uh and they crucified the word on a Roman Tree and and all the negativity around them was all that they could uh it was all that they could see it was their whole narrative it was their whole understanding of of what was going on and they became discouraged they became depressed on the road to EMAs and and Jesus comes and he joins with them and he begins to minister to them to the uh to them the word is that right but but what is very striking to me about the road to EMAs is that is that here they are it's the word himself amen taking on flesh to quote to them the word concerning himself and yet they're right next to that amen and they could not recognize what was happened can you imagine that that to be on a journey and walking step with step with the promise for their day and not even recognize it amen that's a very that's a very alarming picture and brother Brandon would explain this how that just uh and I'll use his own terminology about it when he draws the picture he says here's the resurrected Messiah amen he's and he's revealing the word to them he's expounding them the scriptures amen uh he preached the word he said he read it out of the scripture and they still didn't get it amen and many times we think that we're doing all right amen as message Believers cuz we can quote the quotes and we can preach good sermons amen and we we got the word we got the word amen amen but you find out that there's many people will walk even years in lock step with the word they're hearing it preach they're hearing good anointed preaching amen but there's a revelation missing which causes them not to get the picture right amen but what we want is for the word to come amen and reveal his presence to us today amen and and show to us amen that we're not just communing with a church we're not just communing with Ministries amen but we're communing with the personal presence of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and and he's the one trying to get the word across to you hallelujah oh my amen it takes a real Revelation and the only way that it comes amen is by his personal presence because they could Journey with him they could be associated with him on the road but it wasn't until he came home and came inside amen it was the indwelling Christ that could take the bread and break it amen and open their eyes so that they could know who they were really dealing with amen you can go to church Sunday after Sunday amen and here brother Donnie preached one of the best amen of the best one of the greatest gifts I believe God gave to the bride amen and you can sit under a Ministry like that amen and be blessed and be edified amen but when but your eyes have got to be open Amen to hear the voice behind the voice to recognize the ministry behind the ministry we're not feeding on the words of a man but it's the body word of the son of man that has been broken open to the Bride of Jesus Christ amen amen we're thankful for all all of his gifts we're thankful for all of his ministries but it takes a personal revelation of Christ to see the message right the intellectual mind will never see it the intellectual mind will always look at the circumstances it'll always be looking at the at at it's amazing how the intellectual mind is obsessed with what's going on in the world Amen it's always looking after politics it's always looking after signs in the heavens and it's always looking after superstitions and and movements and doctrines and theologies amen and so it's never settled it's a it's always fear it's always worried it's always upset amen it's always enraged but the Christian amen amen comes into a little room amen where it's shut off from all the bad things that are happening amen the Christian is shut off from all the dark things of the world Amen having communion amen with the Lord amen and having him break the bread of life to us amen so that we can look on the bright side today and realize we're not journeying in darkness now but we're in the presence of the light amen amen we walk with him amen we walk in the light and he is in the light and so the lesson of the road to Emmas is that the word can be fulfilled it's amazing how the word could be fulfilled right in front of us amen but you won't even be aware of it until he breaks it open amen himself brother Bram said man that could turn on the light he said that's the way that God has today his seed is already he his word we read the scripture amen of the of the picture of the seed how it does not return void that's the word of God Amen and the only thing that seed needs is light on it and the life is what breaks forth and brings forth the life out of the grain that's the way that Christ in the word makes the word do what it's supposed to do isn't that amazing you see it Christ the word it takes that light to make the word do what it's supposed to do so we say well we have the word but is it doing what it's supposed to do amen he said ju it's like the life in a grain of wheat it makes so we do what it's supposed to do because of the life that's in it so life is only by the word of God made manifest life only comes to the word of God made manifest as long as it's just in the book it can still be questioned and it is questioned amen but when it's made manifest then you see the product of what it spoke of being manifested then that is light on the word brother sister they've been talking about this word for 2,000 years but we have received a message in our day amen which has manifested the word manifested the word and the manifested word is our light amen if we we God didn't send a message just so we could talk about it amen he didn't send a message just so we could swap quotes and theorize but the message manifested the word amen and that became light to the true sea the manifested word is light and that's that's uh that's what brother brand will tell you when God is is his own interpreter amen that the way that God Reveals His word is he brings it to pass he brings it to pass that's his method of interpreting the word his method is not theology his method is not mental conceptions amen his that's not his method his method is he puts the light on the seed he sends the rain and then he brings it to pass and amen now and and so we see this picture in Isaiah 55 and it's amazing to me when you run these types amen and you look at look at all the ingredients of the process of God vindicating his word amen amen you got to have the seed but what is the seed it's the word amen he is the seed he's also the Light he's also the rain what am I I'm the ground amen but he's the seed he's the light he's the rain he's the word he doesn't need your help amen uh there's a law in a seed it's a law of Genesis that God instituted amen a seed will always bring forth of its own kind is that right and so and so the way that a seed Works amen the law that's in it is that is that it will grow it will push out and someday it will speak for itself amen many times we take a little seed and we wonder amen what kind of a potential is in that seed what kind of a Destiny is in that seed what kind of fruit amen can that seed bring forth amen but the only way to be sure the only way for is for it to grow forth and manifest itself and bear fruit amen amen that's how God does it and you cannot assist that process you can't tamper with that process you can't get your mind involved you can't get your hands into it amen if you try to help that seed along it's not going to bring forth life amen but God's law is he put the life in the seed in the first place and he he sent the light and he sent the rain and if you bring that seed into the right atmosphere it's going to speak for itself and we're going to find out what it is that's God's plan to manifest the seed that's inside of you amen is that he sent a light in this day amen and he rained down the Holy Spirit upon a church it falls on the just and the unjust but it was sent for the wheat amen and the rain came amen so that you amen could be quickened by the spirit amen and come forth and their life that's in you is going to speak for itself it doesn't need your help it doesn't need your interference amen and the more that you try to twist it and tamper it and control it and regulate it amen the more you'll kill it amen that's the law of Genesis and amen you got to bring it into the right atmosphere that's what the spirit of God is for that is the purpose of the Holy Spirit it is the rain that makes the word live amen because we can talk about the word and we can theorize about it amen but without the Holy Spirit reain to down on it it'll never Quicken and it'll never live now now I know I know how it is you know uh uh uh things that we're dealing with around the message today you you can't hardly preach the Holy Spirit today you can't preach the moving of the Holy Ghost without amen without being you know without labels getting thrown around and and you know you try to preach the Holy Ghost and you're a Pentecostal and amen you're you're you're behind and amen you're you're an emotionalist or you're the you're you're a fanatic or or or this or that amen and amen but but but friends don't stumble over the moving of the spirit brother BR says it gets so common to us that we stumble over it don't stumble over it friends amen that's what's making this word live it's not how smart we become it's not how the church has grown it's not what kind of a a high society people that we are amen it's the the Holy Ghost amen rain has been set Amen in this age in this age to bring a bride to maturity Hallelujah I I know I know you know and so it seems like nowadays you can build a whole Ministry just un mocking the moving of the spirit and amen and just and belittling people and amen and and anywhere the Holy Ghost moves well they're immature and they're amen well friend and I I don't I'm not here to be compatitive uh combative amen I'm I'm a man of Peace today but but but I want to amen uh I don't want to have amen I I don't want to see the message get to some a place where where where it gets so easy just to Twist quotes and throw cold water on Revival fires I don't want our young people to grow up in an environment where the spirit is quenched and amen where where they're thirsting for water we've got an everlasting Supply the skies are full amen of the moisture that we need to bring seed to to life amen amen I know that we've seen fanaticism amen I know that we've seen manufactured Revival I know we've seen Pentecostal Traditions but that's not what I'm talking about shouldn't we be looking for the Revival the word brought didn't the word promis Revival didn't the word promise power didn't the word the word promise a new birth amen didn't the word promise Dynamics didn't it promise a rebaptism of the holy spirit amen now now if the word promise it it's going to come and it's going to speak for itself now it may not look like what you expected it may not fit your sensibilities but hold on a little while and let God be his own interpreter amen we'll find out what it really is brother Bram said God is his own interpreter you might not be able to explain it but you know you got it who can explain God nobody can he said I can't tell you how God would show a vision but I know it happens amen and I can't see how God would do these things but I'm glad he said this he said it's not my business to explain it it's not my business to explain it friends amen it's not our business to be message explainers it's not our business to be message Debaters message apologists message philosophers we are message manifestors amen we're not put here to Amen to try to convince the world that it's right we're here to prove that it's right amen by by becoming the manifested word for this day amen this message has got to live one of these days amen it's got to fulfill itself it's not going to return void amen don't we can't turn it into a bunch of intellectualism we can't turn it into a bunch of traditions amen that's not our business but our business is the father's business this is adoption time it's manifesting time amen we got business to be about and it's our business Amen to be about the father's business and brother Bram said that's the secret of the message actually is the father's business amen and what is the father's business he said it's the father's business to fulfill that word it's the father's business to fulfill that word friends and amen and that's what we're doing here that's what it's all about friends this message is not another Creed God didn't send a message so we could go out in the parking lot amen and get into some uh uh intellectual discussion and try to blow somebody's mind and show how spiritual that we are amen but God is looking for a true church in this day amen to be full of the Holy Ghost amen basking in the light of the Sun and come amen and step into her adoption Authority amen if you quench the spirit God can't interpret his word amen and then when God can't interpret his word when you cut off the Holy Spirit then you have to descend the only place to go is to descend into private interpretations amen but we're not the interpreters God is his own interpreter amen and so we descend in a private interpretation you know how uh you know how uh some of you men especially something happens you know I'm I'm a father of three now something happens when you become a dad you all of a sudden you just uh you got we just know everything when we're dads you know and so you let somebody let somebody at church today let their car break down in the parking lot God forbid amen but you know somebody's car breaks down and uh and uh you know how it is you go out there amen the car's broken down something went wrong and there's all the there's all the dads just gathering around something they just sense it it just attracts them and so you know all the men all these men will be standing around and all of a sudden everybody's an auto mechanic I've never fixed an engine in my life but you know there's something about it you just be well maybe it's you know maybe it's the carburetor or maybe it's a you know maybe it's a something in the in the exhaust or maybe maybe it's this and maybe it's that and see see now now you don't have that problem when the car is running the way that it's supposed to amen but if it runs out of gas or something on the mechanical side goes wrong all of a sudden everybody's an expert amen and the thing about it is you know is that everybody's opinions valid and everybody cuz nobody really knows how to fix the thing amen but what you need is the guy who designed it remember brother brand talked about the engineer coming on the side of the road the man the one who designed it the one who who made it the way it was supposed to be the one who knew how it was intended to function amen that's the one you need on the scene friends amen that's what we need in the message when it's not doing what it's supposed to do amen when it's not producing what it's supposed to produce amen then what do we do we all stand around and start talking about it it and theorizing and I wonder if it's this and well my opinion is that amen that's not what we're looking for amen I'm not the engineer amen of this message I'm not the designer of this vehicle amen but there is one amen who designed the mechanics amen he sent the Dynamics Hallelujah and he knows how to make the message speak for itself we got to get out of his way we got to give them the preeminence we got to get back to the blueprints amen we got to keep fuel in it friends amen see I'm I'm not the farmer in this field I'm just a seed and so it's not my business it's not my business to take care of all these things my business is to lay in the presence of the Sun and become exactly what I came from I'm to become exactly what I came from I'm a seed and an original seed cannot mix with hybrid religion hybrid religion now watch watch what takes place watch how the word becomes hybridized what shall I do with Jesus called Christ he said you see God's already got it laid out the Amen Let the ministry study it now you see where it goes wrong God's already got it laid out let the ministry study it but you see they take somebody else's word about it or some group of men amen uh and they're so blinded to the truth that when the truth is presented they fail to see it but you see God is just God is just he's got it wrote out here amen he's got it wrote out he said right here in the book what's going to happen today so it will be fulfilled and and it's my belief amen that when we look down the history of the last 60 years amongst message Believers we've seen a lot of problems we've seen a lot of Amen we've seen a lot of unhappy endings and we've seen all those things but I believe they all boil down to this somewhere somebody got somebody else's idea about it amen or their own opinion or their own private interpretation and got out from under the absolute authority of the restored word for our day amen you you can't you're not going to see it right amen if you run with your own opinion amen you can't mix it amen with some group of men in their opinion Amen in their Direction amen the word has already spoken for itself in our day amen let the ministry study it let the young people listen to it amen play the tapes in your homes read the books read the Bible amen pray for Revelation every day amen you've got the ingredients you need to become a manifested seed but the problem is we get our dirty hands on it amen we try to manipulate it to fit amen our sensibilities and to fit amen our situations friends amen then it won't work for us but that's the problem it's easier it's easier to take somebody else's word for it it's comfortable even and try to take a shortcut to the truth amen but brother BR said there are no shortcuts in the word of God there's one pattern and you must cut yourself to fit that pattern you can't try to cut the pattern to fit you amen can't pen knife this message you can't Whittle away the parts that you don't like amen it and it won't bring forth life he said everybody must do that it's the only way God has of doing it now notice now now now I I I want to deal with uh some things on the topic of identification so watch these phrases brother Bram said notice the Believers wait for that word to be confirmed Believers wait for the word to be confirmed cuz a True Believer is never going to accept just a religious system they're never going to they're never going to sit under a Creed amen not for long anyway amen but the there's something in a True Believer that when God makes a promise the believer's looking for it to come true they're looking for it to be made manifest it's an identification a Believer and that's why the Vindicated word attracts True Believers amen it attracts True Believers and friends that's where I want to be standing today I'm a young man I'm I'm I'm young in my Ministry I'm young as a message believer amen and I'm looking to build I I'm looking to build a family I'm looking to I'm looking to you know I'm looking to get under my pastor help build a church I'm looking to build a Ministry amen I'm looking to build today amen so I want to make sure I got my Foundation right I don't want to build on my opinion I don't want to build on my traditions I don't want to build with some on on top of some group or some movement amen or some private interpretation amen if I'm going to be standing I want to be standing on on something sure and brother BR told the story of old mooses you know what he said I'd rather be standing on this Bible in the hour of my death than to be standing in heaven amen cuz heaven and Earth shall pass away but there's one thing that'll never pass away that's the word of God Amen now he said so let God's word the way that he wrote it no private interpretations amen just speak for itself when no one has polluted it read it and believe it now it may seem strange some of its quotations but God sometimes works in mysterious ways his wonders to perform brother Bram said we must believe it we must believe it we got to see so the True Believer will watch for manifestation and now now now we've had a lot of private interpretations around the message and personality Cults and false doctrines and winds amen and all these things have transpired and they had they were prophesied to come amen and but see we watch these things we watch the little offshoots and amen we watch the little isms amen and we watch them and and after these years we can look and say look they never did bear fruit they never did bear fruit amen any life that was in them was grafted out of the true Branch but they never did Bear the original Fruit amen and so that's the thing when they first came some of you older ones know all the history some of these false teachers came and they made a lot of sense amen and they could point at certain situations they could make a good argument it sounded good to a lot of people it was attractive amen but the True Believer says hold on Amen let's see if it can manifest itself let's see if it can really produce the goods or is it just a little ism is it let a little a fad amen or or or or just a little bit of an excitement amen and uh and we watch them and they've transpired and never did bear fruit amen the all that they do amen I've traveled places where some of these false doctrines have gone amen and pre people preaching that he's off the mercy seed and anything that anything that moves is Pentecostal and amen and the Holy Spirit doesn't do the supernatural anymore and those kind of teachings I've gone and preach in those places you know what it did amen all it did was kill the Revival and assaulted the Earth and another Young Generation never did rise up under those teachings amen why cuz it's not the Original Seed but a True Believer won't settle for that they're looking for a true manifestation they're looking for the message to deliver on the promise and it will deliver on the promise if you'll take your hands off of it amen amen oh my a revelation that doesn't bring manifestation is in your imagination but a Believer will hold out for manifestation you it never submit to a teaching that can't manifest itself no matter how how good it sounds amen but that's the way that people are and that's the way that Humanity manifests itself amen is that things go along and people people are always they get a little dissatisfied with something and it introduces an itch and so the the Bible said they've got itching ears and and somewhere out in this world there's a teacher that'll scratch it amen they they got itching ears something they get a little dissatisfied they get to murmuring or complaining or you know they get a bad attitude toward the minister amen or whatever it is a little bit of family drama any way the devil can get in amen and he starts and he starts tickling your ears amen and so and so that's why that's how uh the unbeliever or the makeb believer manifest El manifest themselves in the End Amen is that they go looking for some teacher that'll scratch the itch but I want to say when I heard the message of the hour it scratched my itch it satisfied my soul amen it brought me Revival it showed me reality it revealed Christ to me amen amen I'm not I'm not I'm not lusting after some new theology I'm not trying to make the take the message and bring it up to date I'm not trying to fill our young people's heads full of some bible store best seller Bible books to our bestseller amen or some psychology or theology or some kind of a 12-step plan amen the message produces the results the message delivers on the promise it always has and it always will let it scratch your itch amen accept the absolute amen get under the headship which has come down on this day amen see see then then you you don't have to you don't have to construct some convoluted you know uh philosophical teaching up in your mind Palace and you know and and jam all the pieces together no brother Bram said the puzzle will go together just right when you let the word speak for itself all of a sudden your cow eats grass all of a sudden your tree bears fruit amen apples come forth on your tree amen when you don't try to jam something in to fit your private interpretation just let the chips fall where they may and let the word speak for itself amen amen the word speaks for itself so I don't have to remember brother said Jesus said follow me follow me and I like the way he said it get rid of what you got and follow me come on Friends what are you following get rid of that thing follow Christ in this day and it's the only way to have eternal life so brother BR said the leadership of God is follow the Vindicated word by the Holy Ghost you see the mechanics and the Dynam follow the Vindicated word by the Holy Ghost so if you're not preaching the Vindicated word amen I I I if it's not the Vindicated word amen it's not leadership and if the Holy Ghost isn't with it it's not leadership but follow the Vindicated word by the Holy Ghost we want it all friends we want the mechanics and the Dynamics I I need the Vindicated word and I need the Holy Ghost leadership in my life I can't just lean on one or the other amen I got to go down the midd Middle Brother Brown said or it's not going to speak and remember he told us about the spirit of Beethoven and he warned us about that how that how that you know you could take you can have the body of Beethoven it's got all the it's got all of the and the body of Beethoven would have all the intelligence in it it would have all the skill in the fingers amen it would have all the in intellect of the mind it would have all the all the functions of the body perfectly laying out here before us in the body of Beethoven but unless the spirit of Beethoven gets into the body of Beethoven it'll never perform the m Masterpiece amen and unless the spirit of God Amen can get into the Bride of Jesus Christ you might have a many membered body you might have a perfect word amen but it's not going to live and it's not going to do the Greater Works and it's not going to deliver on the promise amen cuz we need the spirit now now amen so so we need we need the true leadership now turn in a corner here and the in an absolute brother Bram says God Is Right his word is Right others are not right that kind of bears repeating doesn't it God Is Right his word is Right others not right amen and that's right he said as long as they stay with the word but when you leave the word you leave God cuz God is watching over his word I'm glad for that he's watching over his word to vindicate it he's got he's got to make it real he's got to make it act that's why you people are hungering for a Revival amen 19 63 in absolute he says it's time for these things to believe here now he says if you ever believe me to know what I was talking about you accept that my my how many believe brother brandom knew what he was talking knew what he was talking about he said that's he said it's time for these things to be here amen well I don't see it brother Nathan he said the trouble of it is we got so many absolutes that we don't know what we're tied to we got so many ties one pulling this way and one that way and one against the other how do the people know what to do amen and the but it's the pressure of the holy spirit is coming down trying to find a place to move himself into amen that he can work word by word word by word amen what a what a terrible picture that is amen that God amen amen has has the time is here for Revival The Time Is Here amen for the move of God but you find the holy spirit's trying to find a place he can press into but he's shut out amen by System Shut Out by denominational ideas Shut Out by private interpretations but I would say oh God Amen I want to open up the door come in Lord Jesus let the Holy Spirit press down into me and Build Me Up word by word into what you what you predestinated me to be hallelujah amen you we we know that we know the word is our Plum line you guys in construction know what a plum line is you you hang it up on an anchor amen and it and it and and there's a law that governs it amen that that that that that Plum line will always hang straight it'll always be true because it's governed by a law amen and and amen but you know what happens is sometimes amen we get to looking at the plum line and we think man it would just be you know what uh it would fit it it would fit what I've already constructed if we just if we could just move it over a little bit or maybe you know oh man you know uh my my little private interpretation is in the way so maybe if I take the plum line just kind of wrap it around and then and then get back on track and let that hang down friends amen you'll never finish the building amen that God will never build this house amen the Capstone will never come down Amen on a on a building which has been constructed amen if you don't take your hands off the plum line that's what we got to do amen get your hands off of this message get your opinions out of this message let the let the plum line fall amen it's one side is tight in heaven amen and the law of God has brought it down to earth to point us on the straight and narrow path you don't have to be smart amen you don't you don't have to be you don't have to be all that intelligent amen he's made the way straight he makes the Crooked straight amen he he raises up The Valleys amen he brings down the mountains Amen to open up a way by the plum line it's straight now it's narrow but it's straight amen and the Bible says a fool cannot Heir in that way Amen in other words it's so straight the only thing you got to do is take the message and keep going just don't quit just don't get off in a ditch don't get to lean in this way don't get to lean in that way amen walk on the way and you might be a fool but you won't mess up you'll get where you're going it's foolproof you know what he's looking for today is a fool to prove it just just a somebody foolish enough to believe God and prove prove that the word of God delivers on the promise amen amen see so many people are so handson with the word and they want to take that Plum line and get it all twisted up just let go amen and and so they're because they're just afraid of getting off balance I find that I find that you know we work a lot with the young people the holy spirit will fall you know and God will do a work at a youth camp or youth meeting something like that and all of a sudden they come running out of the woodwork and everybody wants to balance you out heyen God sends a shout they got to balance the shout God God God brings a dance they got to balance the dance and make sure just make sure you're not off balance now amen now now I believe in walking down the middle of the road amen God in Simplicity brother random instructed us don't get in a fanatical ditch don't get in a formal ditch stay down the middle of the road friends but you know I I've been raised in this message 34 years grown up in the message amen has has has has kind of programmed me a certain way whenever somebody mentions the word balance a little red flag goes ping cuz isn't that the way isn't that the biggest weasel word that we got sometimes is well oh well we got to have a balance I I know brother Bram said not to wear shorts but we got to have a balance and I know I know I know he blasted this and I know there's that quote but we got to have a I mean we got to have a balance and and so that's the thing if you want to come and balance me out what are you going to balance me with what are you going to balance me with cuz I want to stay on balance amen but I want to know amen if God Vindicated what you're trying to balance me with cuz there's such a thing as a false balance the Bible says a false balance is an Abomination to the Lord but a just weight is his Delight amen I believe in taking the middle of the road but you know what I believe the middle is not halfway between you and me truth is not 50% between my opinion and your opinion I'll tell you what's between you and me compromise amen but don't oh friends don't let a devil come and try to balance your freedom with some kind of a formal tradition don't let him balance your Liberty with his legalism don't let the devil balance this message with your mental conception don't balance my Revival with your religion you want to try to play Both Sides you'll end up on the Wayside but if you want a real balance preach the message of the hour teach the message of the hour believe Amen in the Vindicated word for for your day you'll stay in the middle of the road preach the whole message preach nothing but the message amen it'll balance itself sooner or later somebody's going to have to Manifest this message amen so every time the spirit of God tries to do something Among Us amen if we come running like a bunch of firefighters to pour cold water on it and make sure that everything's just so and make sure everything's balance out right amen well then you know if we just keep quenching the spirit we'll never see it friends but sooner or later there's going to be a word shout sooner or later there's going to be a word dance there'll be word tongues word interpretations word preaching amen word baptisms amen and I'm looking for it it's promised to me the time is now amen but get rid of what you got and follow the leadership for this day and let it speak for itself let God be his own interpreter this message is going to live amen it's going to produce it may not fit your sensibilities but if it's according to the word if it fits the word just let it speak for itself brother B said I don't believe in fanaticism who here believes in fanaticism it's what I thought I don't believe in fanaticism I wouldn't stand for it the prophet said and I know you don't believe in fanaticism you believe in the truth and he said and truth will always speak for itself that's right you never have to strain truth truth truth will always be truth you see what a people to get in the ditch on the other side they know God promised a Revival they know great things and they try to get like Moses and in their intellectual Faith they try to pump something up and they try to take matters into their own hands well you might kill yourself a measly Egyptian that way but you're not getting the people out of here amen but so and so and so it's just the same amen when we try to manufacture a Revival and we think well you know uh and we start pressuring the people well if you don't dance if you don't shout if you don't something's wrong with you friends you shouldn't have to strain truth it's just another form of legalism it's just another form of formalism Amen but let the truth amen be preached let the Holy Spirit back it up you won't have to strain it you won't have to push it you don't have to work anything up it delivers on the promise I'm a witness of it truer Tabernacle is a witness of it amen Word of Life is a witness of it how many are witness amen that the word amen if you take your hands off it don't try to help it don't try to baby that seed don't try to peel it open before it's ripe let it bask in the light of the sun amen preach the message to it let the Holy Spirit move over it amen and if it's a true seed it'll speak for itself in spite of you in spite of when we mess up in spite of things go wrong in spite of all the water under the bridge the message is still going to put a bride in a Rapture hallelujah oh don't strain it Friends when the light of this manifest of word strikes the seed it will Quicken to believe it you see cuz Believers believe that's what we do you say well how do you how do you recognize a Believer they believe amen and brother brandom we'll begin to deal with our identification Vince made clear he says when the true Bible Believers see the word so openly Vindicated for the age they believe and you know what there's no way to keep them from it they believe it they even seal their testimony with their blood they believe it so it's to them then it's to them the predestinated that for that certain age that sees and believe so God has a predestinated seed somewhere amen that when the light flashes across them something on the inside's going to Quicken and they're going to believe it and they're going to believe it amen because they're predestinated to do it and what's the evidence of predestination amen is to believe the Vindicated word amen uh God identified by characteristics amen when you're looking for the evidence of the Bride in this day Amen brother brand would give us the evidence but he would go down through all the false evidences he would say you know Luther said when you believe you've got it and the Methodist says when you shout you got it when the Pentecostal said when you spoke in tongues you had it and brother Bram said we find all of that's wrong it's all wrong and some of them said now this is a great big statement if this don't knock you out of your shoes amen he says some of them say the fruit of the spirit has got it amen and it's wrong and you know he'll take you to those kind old priests and all the things that they could imitate but there's one thing that cannot be imitated amen and that is the quickening of the seed amen and when it comes forth amen it reproduces the original amen under the True Light under the true rain a true seed amen will replicate the original and that's something only you can do brother Bram said the only evidence is Vindication when God himself identifies himself in the promised word of the hour amen see we we 2,000 years we've been trying to sort it out amen but thank God he sent a message in our day and God himself came on the scene and spoke for himself and Vindicated that message unto us and you know what the Believers do they believe the message they Quicken to life under that light amen and they come up under their maturity under it and at no point in the process amen can you move them to a hot house and put them under an artificial interpretation amen see amen God himself identifies himself and the real evidence of a true seed is they receive and accept and believe the Vindication amen when the word speaks it is speaking identification you say what well okay the word speaks for S brother Nathan God sent a message but what is the message some of you young people have never you've been raised in it but you never asked yourself that question what is the message what is the message put it in a paragraph explain it to me oh yeah you know God s a prophet you know we believe a message what does it say Amen but you find out this message is a message of identification Christ has come Amen to Bear witness to the true seed in this age amen and so when the light flashes over you your response to that light amen is going to prove who you are and identify you as a true seed of God Amen oh my the word interpreted brother Bram said is the manifestation of the name of God Amen so he's identifying people which are called by his name I I wish we had time to Amen to to get in all these things amen but brother man would say the word interpreted becomes the name of God Amen and he then where does he take you from there he takes you right to Peter amen he actually at that time was Simon barjona and he takes you right to Peter amen how how many know that Peter had a revelation amen he that that that scripture that's not that's not about popes that's about Revelation amen and so and so uh Jesus amen is asking all the disciples amen and he's he's trying to ask him who do men say that I am and they could all talk the talk they were all up on the current events oh yeah you know that guy over there he's preaching this and that one over there you know and we've had that movement and this and then he said but who do you say who do you say that I am amen and there were so many of the disciples amen that lacked Revelation and all that they had was a bunch of suay some say you're Elijah some say you're that Prophet some say you're Moses some say some say some say and that's what we got too much of around the message of the hour it's somebody body got just enough amen uh they got just enough understanding to join a church amen join a group grow up in a family adopt a lifestyle amen some say well brother Donnie said amen well brother Wayne said brother Nathan said brother brandom said amen but who do you say who do you say that this message is come on it's on your hands today what are you going to do with it but thank God Peter had a revelation something stirred up in his heart it wasn't flesh and blood that gave it to him it wasn't because he was so well educated it wasn't how many times he read the church age book it was a revelation from God striking a true seed amen and he raised up and he said you are Christ amen I remember when it happened to me amen when the light flashed before my eyes and the message that I grew up hearing amen jumped off the pages and spoke to me Amen in the voice of Christ amen and something my heart said this is not just the church that I belong to too this is not just the family I was raised in this is the Christ and he has coming my day to speak to me and identify me cuz that's what the Revelation does Amen the because the Revelation said Thou Art the Christ and the further Revelation turned back around and said yes I am and you are Peter amen he wasn't Peter before that but he had a name change amen cuz when the word spoke for itself it changed his identification it changed his identity that's what it did for me amen there's a whole list of sins and shortcomings amen that you can attach to the name of Nathan Ericson but Nathan Ericson is not my identification but a message is coming this day amen to speak for itself amen and reveal to me I am of Christ I'm married to him and I'm known by his name I carry his reputation oh friends amen you need a personal revelation of Jesus Christ amen but if but see what it does it turns around and it identifies you back oh my we get we stress and strain looking for the evidence trying to find something to hold on to trying to shout enough dance enough speak in tongues or something Amen to to Amen to have enough Faith but friends it's your revelation of this word it's this light it's this rain amen the life that it is quickened inside you is the evidence and it might look humble now but give it time amen and keep it in the right atmosphere and it'll speak for itself Flesh and Blood doesn't reveal it the true revelation of this message is a personal revelation God is identifying your name on his book God sent a prophet to tell you what God was thinking about before the foundation of the world what was he thinking about me me cuz my name was on his book Amen brother said there were names in there that were put in there from the foundation of the world but as long as those names had never been manifested in Earth yet amen he had to stay there as an intercessor as long as there's one name that hasn't been declared in this earth Christ has to stay there as an intercessor what's he doing brother BR said he's taking care of that name Hallelujah friends you didn't get here by accident you didn't stumble into this message amen but the day that you tripped over it actually it came looking for you Amen to call you out of this world call you out of this Darkness Amen to Quicken a seed on the inside of you Amen to prove to you that he was thinking about you before the foundation of the world and if your name was on his book amen he's going to take care of that name amen cuz it's not your name and your reputation that he's defending but it's his name Prophet even said Q&A on the seals amen he said it's not just exactly you know Orman Neville will be saved on this day and you know it's not it's not like a diary of your life experiences amen but he said what it is the revelation of the book is is is revealed amen and then we just believe in it amen and so see what I'm saying is Amen in this day the under the voice of the seventh angel the mystery was finished and the fact that you received it amen the fact that you believed it the fact that it quickens something inside of you proves you were part of that mystery all along your name was on his book I know this I know there's a lot of things the devil would like a pen to the book of your life and he's keeping record of all your faults and all your mistakes and all your failures amen and and the devil keeps a record on the book of life amen but on the Lamb's Book of Life brother Ram said there's only names it's only names amen he doesn't record there all the all the failure he doesn't record the background that you came out of he doesn't record your lowest moments he doesn't record your struggles but written there Amen in red ink is the name of his elected seed amen and the light is flashing this day to Quicken you and prove to you amen that you belong to that you're part of that you're part of him part of his word hallelujah amen brother Bram said you're a written epistle he said in other words I turn it this way he said you're an epistle that's already been written oh friends amen you don't know what that means to me amen the thing about it's already been written that Satan would like to change it he there's Parts he would like to take out there's a lot that he would like to add to it amen but it was already written in the mind of God Amen you can't it's too late now it's a written epistle amen God was thinking about it amen but it's not thought today it's become spoken word and God uttered his voice in this generation and manifested Sons and Daughters out of the very dust of this Earth [Applause] Amen to speak for themselves the spoke you are spoken word children the you have a voice amen take this message eat it I know parts are bitter and parts are sweet eat all of it amen and then amen and then let it become a voice prophesy speak you've got a Ministry oh and I love the ministry we have whosoever will let him come I tell you what if you if you're if you're longing for identity searching for the real you amen if you're hungry for satisfaction if you're looking for amen you're living in a world of famine it's dry it's dark amen it's hungry you're looking for food you're looking for water you're looking for light come amen come to the Revelation come to the message amen but come in the right way Amen Let It Be Your Food let it be your water let it be your identity bask in the light of God's leadership for this day oh Hallelujah uh if I was in his book there's a predestinated seed in me and so if I just lay in this light it's going to speak for itself because I've received my identification wouldn't it be nice young people some of you that have have have worked out your salvation with fear and trembling amen and and and and the Devils toss you back and forth on whether you got the Holy Ghost and whether you're really a Christian or really what would it mean if it wasn't Nathan Ericson standing here but but William brandham could take the pulpit today amen and stand here and and and and exercise that gift and say as he said many times in prayer line take you by the hand say God bless you brother I see you're a real Christian oh that would mean something to me that would mean a whole lot to me Amen to to receive just to have that that little confirmation just to have that little nudge amen something I could hold on to God's Prophet saw something in me but friends God saw something in me amen and when I received the revelation of this message it was such an identification to me amen I don't see see see there's something about it it's my reality it is my world it is my passion something on the inside of me screams out it jumps and says Amen to every word of it amen why because I'm identified Amen in the message for the hour I don't need to wait for brother brandom to come back and get in a little room of a tent somewhere and have him tell me who I am amen I've already received my identification don't you realize what has come to you church amen I no longer call you church I call you bride you're known by my name except the identification of the hour that's that's my identification not in what a prophet told me not in what some man said not in the preacher that prayed over me amen but it's the Vindicated word of the hour that has identified me cuz brother Bram said when you recognize the very word of God was Eagle food you heard from your theophany woo there was a predestinated germ that was in you for this hour and amen amen and brother Brown said when the anointed word of God is Vindicated before amen somebody with that predestinated germ he will see God's message as sure as there's a God in [Music] heaven why was it when this light flashed across you you left that system you were in you turned down those denominational Creeds your family turned away from you your friends turned away from you but something in your soul said amen I've heard that eagle scream amen that's where I belong I don't belong down here with the chickens pecking for my daily meal but I was created and predestinated to soar in Heavenly places in Christ I'm an eagle amen and you left everything to follow this message why cuz you belong to it amen you are part of the mystery amen all the mystery of God has been revealed in this day and it's not all seven seal and third pole and water baptism and serpent seed but it's names that were mysteriously recorded on his book but the mystery has been revealed amen amen and my response to the Vindicated word has proved that I was one of those mysterious ATT attributes which he kept in his heart down through eons of time he carried though he carried that secret amen he didn't show it to anybody it was never revealed under Moses Ministry it was never revealed under Isaiah's Ministry it wasn't revealed under Malachi amen but when the Lord Jesus Christ came he carried the mystery in his heart amen of all those attributes that were on his book he carried Me to the Cross amen amen but when he went down to the grave and when he came out of that grave amen he carried me with him amen I was there I was identified in him and now in this day identification has come once again to prove that it's so I'm a part of my savior I'm a part of his word I can really see now who I am who I am Oh Glory there's fine people in this world fine churches but he said there's one Mrs Jesus Christ that's who he's coming for that's where his name lays that's where his worship is in her and her alone what does it mean to be the Bride of Jesus Christ it means you're the word not just a letter word that that'll kill amen but you are the spoken word seed amen God thought of you brother BR said he spoke it and here you are what a privilege to stand here in the pulpit and look out at what God was thinking about before the foundation of the world brother Bram said if the word is in you you and the word are the same all the word is you are if I'm living in this generation he said what this portion of word has promised for this generation I've got to be that I've got to be that don't turn that into legalism now don't turn that into works oh I've got to be that no amen all the word is I am and what it has spoken for of this day I'll be that because if I'm a true seed I'll speak for myself let's all stand what a message the personal presence of Christ here on the earth in a flesh body but it's a many-membered body it's a bride body you look on the outside of it it looks so humble unlikely weak but when the light flashes you could catch a glimpse of deity in human vessels deity not behind Badger skins God in skin what kind of a people should we be I'll tell you what friends there's only way to be one way to be what we're supposed to be and let and there's only way one way that the word will do what it's supposed to do that's if we take our hands off of it let it speak for itself amen you realize how real it is the picture the word in flesh first quote that we read the word in flesh quoting the word of the letter fully identified with himself listen to him quote in the message shalom remember he showed us the contrast between such a dark World such heavy Darkness on the people but light to us amen and how how often we get like those disciples on the road to EMAs and we could think back on all the terrible things that we've seen happen all the history around the message of the hour things that have gone down gone uh transpired with Ministries and churches and families and all these kind of things and and we look at the world that we're living in it's a darkness that the world has never seen Satan's eeden at its full height amen and we we become a discouraged people because we're looking at the wrong thing amen but but friends if we could see our identification if we could receive our shalom message if we could just look on the bright side today we'd realize the presence of the one that we're walking in I know the earthquakes I know the sun amen I I I I know that in this day they crucified truth on another Roman Tree but you are walking in the light and he is in the light and it's so good to have Fellowship one with another look on the bright side today brother br said in that Shalom message he said now we see his word Vindicated we believe so if he Vindicated the word of today what do I care about what the year brings what do I care about next year what do I care whether I live today or die every word that he promised will be Vindicated everyone amen God bless you [Applause] amen am amen reminds me of this song the day before yesterday a Crucified My [Music] Lord beet him on mercifully and nailed him to a tree the sky grew dark and the Earth began to you fall people cried surely think of it we've crucified the Son of God help me sing it now why didn't we recognize the Son of God was here today hidden our hearts burn as he talked along the way shouldn't we have known thank God we have no wish we had known him before the Lord had come and [Music] gone today a friend and I walk down the road we did know our Lord had Rose Glory but then a man Drew near and spoke words so wise that same man's right here today he broke the bread and blessed it amen vanished and opened up our eyes why didn't we recognize Glory here today didn't our hearts burn as Jesus talked along the away shouldn't we have have known aren't you glad you've known Hallelujah so glad so glad so glad before the Lord let us sing the bride's version of it today oh I'm so glad we've recognize the Mighty God is here to has in our hearts burn as he talked along the way aren't you glad you've known how many's glad I'm so glad I've known so very glad I've known him him soon he'll come and we'll be gone I'm so glad we've recognized the Mighty God is here today Hallelujah burn as we part along the way I'm so glad thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah so very glad I've known yes Lord aren't you glad you've known him soon he'll come and we'll be G hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus Oh hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord oh thank God I trust that your hearts deserve desire today is to let the word manifest itself out of your life as a son or daughter of God there's no greater honor higher honor that we could give the Lord Jesus than to allow his word to manifest out of us just manifest itself out of us live his own life there's only one person that can live a Christian Life that isn't me me that isn't you it's Christ so if Christ lived in Peter and John and Paul and you and you and me what will it be a Christian Life consecrated to his cause for this hour oh my it's been an awesome weekend want to say how we appreciate all the visitors that have been with us and um as it's already been said the sisters have prepared the food and our brother Nathan for studying praying coming leaving his family back home and coming to be a part of us don't we thank God for it what's it going to be when we all gather

missing it that day we ask that you would bless and sanctify the food for those that'll be partaking of it today Father the hands that prepared it all the effort that's put forth Lord Jesus I know it may not make sense to some people but I want to thank you again Lord that you've given us a place where now we can have meetings like this it's not been so long ago that in our own little building it was so small that we couldn't even host a service like this a special weekend I thank you Lord I know I've said it to you over and over again I rarely come over here whether I'm pulling weeds or killing weeds or laying rocks or whatever I'm doing but I don't thank you for letting us have this place cuz it wasn't just given to us the local assembly it was given that we could have meetings like
