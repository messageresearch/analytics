[33:00] Heavenly Father we know that's been said
[33:03] for over 2,000 years
[33:07] now that early church when they saw you
[33:09] ascend up on the Mount of
[33:13] Ascension no doubt they went around
[33:15] telling
[33:16] everybody it may not be but a week or
[33:19] maybe a
[33:20] month or maybe a year he'll be
[33:25] back that generation passed
[33:28] the Next Generation started believing
[33:30] the same thing and the next and the next
[33:35] and the
[33:36] next here we are 2,000 years later and
[33:40] we're believing the same
[33:43] thing but Lord God We Believe by
[33:46] prophecy and the things that we can see
[33:48] in your word that there has never been a
[33:51] generation that's as close as we
[33:55] are therefore father the sincere Cry of
[33:58] our heart is we want to be ready above
[34:03] everything in our
[34:05] life so this is one of the reasons that
[34:07] we come together
[34:09] tonight your Prophet has told us that
[34:12] when we come to church we come to be
[34:16] told about our wrongs our
[34:19] shortcomings where we mess up I realize
[34:24] that's unusual because a lot of folks
[34:25] don't go to church for that reason
[34:27] anymore more but we do we want to know
[34:31] where we're wrong so we can fix it we
[34:34] want to know what we can do to be a
[34:37] people that's better pleasing to you we
[34:40] ask tonight that you would take your
[34:41] word and speak to us father help me to
[34:44] get out of the way anoint me anoint the
[34:48] people that we can be able to make this
[34:51] service what you want it to be help us
[34:54] to realize that you are not going to
[34:56] commend this service tonight
[34:58] and take over the preacher and take over
[35:00] the leoty take over the musicians take
[35:04] over the singers and you're just going
[35:06] to do it all you will use us but you

[35:23] give their pullings on the gift tonight
[35:26] father so that this service can be
[35:29] something of Eternal value in the name
[35:31] of the Lord Jesus we pray amen praise
[35:36] the Lord ain't God good amen oh he is so
[35:41] good praise the
[35:43] Lord Revelation chap 10 verse
[35:47] one question and answers tomorrow night
[35:49] at 7:00 we got some really good
[35:52] questions to look at by the help of the
[35:54] Lord also be streaming that for those of
[35:57] you
[35:58] old people that can come to the young
[36:01] people's
[36:02] service so I tell you that've been a
[36:05] blessing not only to the youths but I've
[36:07] heard from people all over the world
[36:08] that just really enjoying him and
[36:11] benefiting that's that's wonderful
[36:13] that's why we do it Revelation 10 verse
[36:17] one and I saw another Mighty Angel come
[36:19] down from heaven clothed with a cloud
[36:21] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[36:25] face as it were the Sun and his feet as
[36:29] pillars of
[36:30] fire and he had in his hand a little
[36:33] book open and he set his right foot upon
[36:37] the sea and his left foot upon the Earth
[36:41] and cried with a loud voice as when a
[36:45] lion
[36:46] Roth and notice all these verses are
[36:49] filled with
[36:52] symbolisms so it's not real plain it's
[36:55] hid behind types and an types and when
[36:59] he had cried seven Thunders uttered
[37:01] their voices and when the seven Thunders
[37:04] uttered their voices I was about to
[37:07] write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[37:11] saying unto me seal up those things
[37:14] which the seven Thunders uttered and
[37:17] write them not and the angel which I saw
[37:20] stand upon the sea and upon the Earth
[37:23] lifted up his hand to heaven now this is
[37:26] a sworn
[37:28] affidavit and swear by him that liveth
[37:31] forever and ever who created heaven and
[37:34] the things that therein are in the earth
[37:36] and the things that therein are and the
[37:38] Sea and the things which are therein
[37:42] that there should be time no longer but
[37:45] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[37:47] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[37:50] mystery of God should be finished as he
[37:54] hath declared to his servants
[37:57] the prophets and the people of God said
[38:01] amen may the Lord bless his word you may
[38:04] be
[38:05] seated Read With Me Now from The Book of
[38:08] Ruth chapter 4 verse
[38:11] 9 and Boaz said unto the elders and unto
[38:15] all the
[38:16] people ye are witnesses this day that I
[38:19] have bought all that was elik all that
[38:24] was chilion and maon
[38:27] of the hand of Naomi moreover Ruth the
[38:32] moabitas the wife of
[38:35] mean have I purchased to be my wife now
[38:39] remember this is kinsman redeemer that
[38:42] we're talking about to raise up the name
[38:45] of the Dead upon his
[38:48] inheritance that the name of the Dead be
[38:51] not cut off from among his Brethren I
[38:55] want you to notice these next words
[38:58] and from the
[39:00] Gate of his place I want you to see that
[39:05] his emphasis is to raise up the
[39:08] inheritance of Maan Maan had died
[39:12] without seed so the leverate marriage
[39:17] was that the next of Ken and the family
[39:20] would take this Widow and marry the
[39:23] Widow and the firstborn would bear the
[39:26] name
[39:28] of Malon he would also get a double
[39:31] portion of the inheritance now Boaz is
[39:34] willing to do this this is going to cost
[39:36] him a great deal Boaz is a wealthy man
[39:41] so he will have to take of his own
[39:43] inheritance in order to bring this to
[39:46] pass if he follows through with this now
[39:49] watch what he says that the name of the
[39:51] Dead be not cut off from among his
[39:54] Brethren and from the Gate of of his
[39:58] place from the Gate of his place this is
[40:03] taking place at Bethlehem why Bethlehem
[40:08] Bethlehem was the headquarters or the
[40:12] seat of the government of the place
[40:15] where their possession was so he could
[40:19] not go to another city in a nearby City
[40:24] and be able to make this legal
[40:27] transaction at the gate at another town
[40:32] so it must be the gate by which maon
[40:36] chilion and their father on The
[40:39] Inheritance so where was Naomi's
[40:42] inheritance under the jurisdiction of
[40:45] Bethlehem which is what house of God's
[40:49] bread now I want you to realize how that
[40:51] he emphasizes the inheritance and he
[40:54] also emphasizes the gate of his place ye
[40:59] are witnesses this day so he goes before
[41:02] the Elders of the little town of
[41:06] bethelem because this is the Gate of the
[41:11] jurisdiction of The Inheritance that
[41:13] he's going to purchase now I want you to
[41:16] I want you to think with me tonight that
[41:18] the Bible tells us about the Lord Jesus
[41:22] that when he come to the Earth and when
[41:24] he died and gave his life that he
[41:27] suffered without the gate now there's
[41:32] two places in Israel that they attribute
[41:36] could be Calvary one is called Gordon's
[41:40] Calvary and then the other we went there
[41:43] five or six years ago whenever we were
[41:45] there and it's near the bus station and
[41:49] it actually looks like a place of a
[41:51] skull because of the formation of the
[41:55] Rocks it's not the traditional one that
[41:59] most of them accept as Calvary which
[42:02] probably pretty well tells you that's
[42:04] the right one uh you know every other
[42:06] place that the church recognized which
[42:08] if you're not familiar with it it was
[42:10] actually
[42:12] Constantine's mother the Roman emperor
[42:15] Constantine it was his mother that went
[42:19] to Israel and begin to search for all
[42:23] the so-called holy places and after she
[42:28] found them by tradition then she set up
[42:31] want to build a church here you know
[42:33] Monastery whatever more here there and
[42:35] there so there is places that are
[42:39] accepted by the religious world that are
[42:42] that and then there's other places which
[42:45] was passed down by the tradition of some
[42:47] of the apostolic fathers which is the
[42:50] one I tend to follow so Calvary is the
[42:53] same way actually two places of the
[42:56] garden tomb to places of Calvary but
[42:59] whenever you look at it and you realize
[43:02] that one of them is outside of the city
[43:06] gate now one thing that a lot of
[43:09] Christians do not understand is that the
[43:12] Lord Jesus at Calvary he purchased and
[43:17] paid the price so that the book of
[43:19] redemption could be taken but he did not
[43:23] take it at Calvary the book was was not
[43:27] there I know emphasize to you again
[43:29] Wednesday night I want to emphasize it
[43:31] again tonight that the book was not
[43:34] there he could not take the book at
[43:38] Calvary he had to
[43:41] wait until he became
[43:45] righteous
[43:48] again I know that's staggering and I
[43:51] know it's mindboggling but think about
[43:53] it he could not have taken the book of
[43:58] redemption at the
[44:00] cross he had to wait till he was
[44:05] righteous
[44:06] again you understand because at the
[44:10] cross he died the death not of a
[44:14] righteous man but of a
[44:18] sinner not because of what he did but of
[44:22] what he become so he could not become a
[44:27] curse in the eyes of God and walk up
[44:32] before the Throne of God and take the
[44:35] book out of God's
[44:37] hand so the book was not at the cross
[44:41] I'm afraid even some of our message
[44:44] Brothers do not comprehend this is why
[44:47] they don't preach the opening of the
[44:49] seals this is why they see no
[44:52] significance brother Joe of talking
[44:54] about the Thunders in the book and it
[44:57] being our inheritance this is why even
[44:59] in our own ranks they still are
[45:02] emphasizing only at the cross itself and
[45:06] remember we can never have the book
[45:09] without the cross but we can never get
[45:12] our inheritance without both so the
[45:16] cross paved the way by which the lamb
[45:20] could take the book which he could not
[45:22] do at Calvary because he became our sin
[45:27] he who knew no sin became our sin that
[45:32] we might become the very righteousness
[45:36] of God so he could not be a sinner son
[45:41] at the same time no more than you and I
[45:44] could so he forfeited his rights to
[45:47] sunship listen to it forsaking all
[45:50] Phoenix
[45:52] 1962 In The Garden of Gethsemane the
[45:54] anointing left him and he had to die on
[45:58] the cross a curse in the eyes of God so
[46:02] the book could not be taken he had to
[46:06] wait till he returned to that state of
[46:10] righteousness again so it must be the
[46:15] consignment and the full operation of
[46:18] redemption had to be back at the Gate of
[46:23] his
[46:24] city which was not
[46:27] Jerusalem so where must Jesus take the
[46:32] book it must be Hallelujah it must be
[46:37] back at his City Boaz had to make this
[46:43] legal contract of marriage where at the
[46:48] Gate of the city of Beth
[46:52] elim Beth elim which was whose City
[46:58] milon's City so it must be
[47:02] reconciliation and Redemption to make it
[47:06] legal it must been acted upon by Boaz in
[47:11] the front of
[47:13] witnesses at
[47:15] milon's City
[47:17] Gate the Lord Jesus could not take the
[47:21] book
[47:23] outside of Jerusalem's gate he could pay
[47:28] the price and as Paul tells us that he
[47:32] suffered without the gate but remember
[47:36] the book and the marriage of redemption
[47:40] and the
[47:41] reconciliation of all of those
[47:43] attributes that was in God's mind had to
[47:47] be witnessed at the Gate of his City not
[47:52] natural Jerusalem so what was the gate
[47:57] of the city of the Lamb of God the New
[48:02] Jerusalem so the
[48:04] reconciliation the price certainly was
[48:08] paid at Calvary and there the blood the
[48:12] subaryanto
[48:27] and she comes before him no doubt as was
[48:30] her custom and she would fall down
[48:32] before him to take him by the legs and
[48:36] simply Embrace him around the legs and
[48:40] he said touch me
[48:43] not don't you touch
[48:46] me I have not yet ascended to my God and
[48:52] your God I have not ascended up
[48:57] but after he goes up and then comes back
[49:02] when he meets with his
[49:04] brothers he tells them touch me handle
[49:09] me see I'm I'm like you I'm like you
[49:14] only in a glorified form now what had
[49:17] happened in between the time that he
[49:21] told Mary not to touch him and when
[49:23] Thomas said I will not believe until I
[49:27] thrust my hand in his side and until I
[49:30] put my fingers in the prince in his hand
[49:34] and when Jesus comes he said oh
[49:37] hail touch me
[49:39] Thomas so the
[49:41] blood the high priest had now taken the
[49:46] blood before the mercy seat which is
[49:50] before the
[49:52] Eternal and offered the blood as an Aton
[49:57] for every person's name who was in the
[50:00] Lamb's Personal
[50:03] Diary he is offered before the father
[50:08] because the
[50:10] sacrifice of the high priest's body
[50:13] could not be tainted by Humanity but
[50:17] once the sacrifice has been made then he
[50:21] comes back he eats with his brothers
[50:25] they handle him
[50:27] they sit down and eat and they no doubt
[50:30] they touch him and they rub him and oh
[50:33] Jesus we love you so much but now it
[50:36] could be done because he was righteous
[50:41] again oh glory to God don't you
[50:45] understand he had to become in an
[50:49] unrighteous State he forfeited all of
[50:53] that and kicked off his shoe of dignity
[50:58] he kicked off his resplendant glory he
[51:02] kicked off all of that to take upon him
[51:06] our sin our Darkness our wretchedness
[51:10] and become oh oh my everything that we
[51:14] needed he became that and then when he
[51:18] did he must finalize this contract
[51:23] before the Gate of his City you see had
[51:29] Boaz went to a city in Ephraim had he
[51:33] went to a another city this contract
[51:38] with Ruth would not have been binding
[51:42] but it was binding only if the kinsman
[51:47] redeemer went to the city where the
[51:51] inheritance laid praise be to God can't
[51:55] you understand why didn't go down to
[51:57] Hell and get the book cuz the devil
[51:59] didn't have the book and your
[52:01] inheritance was not in Hell well praise
[52:04] be to God you had nothing in Hell
[52:07] brother Donnie ain't you scared of going
[52:08] to hell I didn't come from hell I ain't
[52:11] going to hell come on somebody I am from
[52:15] the mind of God and that's where I'm
[52:17] going back to no sir there's nothing
[52:20] about hell that sounds like home to me I
[52:23] don't cry when I your preachers preach
[52:25] about hell but I sure do cry when I hear
[52:28] them preach about heaven I I do cry when
[52:30] I hear singers sing about heaven because
[52:33] that sounds like home to me I ain't
[52:36] worried about going to hell I didn't
[52:38] come from there there's nothing about me
[52:40] that lines up with hell I was only the
[52:43] under the influence of that for a short
[52:45] time in my life but those days are gone
[52:49] and my king rose up and he went before
[52:52] the Gate of our city where our
[52:55] inheritance lay and before Witnesses he
[52:58] said let it be known this day I have
[53:02] redeemed my predestinated bride every
[53:06] thought that was in my mind let it be
[53:09] known that I have redeemed her she is my
[53:13] wife and in every one of them in their
[53:17] season they will come to me I don't care
[53:20] how darkness in I don't care how lost
[53:22] and sin they are I'll get them if I've
[53:25] got to knock them in the head I'll get
[53:27] them if I've got to break the leg I'll
[53:29] do whatever I got to do I declare It In
[53:33] The City Gate she is mine Satan take
[53:38] your hand off of my
[53:47] wife notice he says moreover Ruth and mo
[53:52] is the wife of meon if I purchased to be
[53:54] my wife to raise up the name name of the
[53:56] Dead upon his inheritance that the name
[53:59] of the Dead be not cut off from among
[54:01] his Brethren from the gate from the
[54:06] Gate of his place from the Gate of his
[54:13] place so when we look in Revelation five
[54:16] then we see the book in the hands of the
[54:19] great Creator which come back from the
[54:22] hands of Adam there it had been for all
[54:25] these thousands of years waiting for
[54:28] what a kinsman redeemer a goel one that
[54:32] would be able to pay the price then come
[54:35] back through the city gate and be able
[54:40] to walk up before the Throne of God and
[54:43] be able to reach force and take that
[54:46] book and be able to say I did it and it
[54:51] must be one without fault it must be one
[54:54] without blame don't you understand why I
[54:56] could not do that at the cross the book
[54:59] was not at the cross what was at the
[55:02] cross was the altar it was the altar by
[55:07] which the precious blood must be spilled
[55:10] on the altar but Revelation five was
[55:13] calling for what let one can come to
[55:16] take the book and what did John see he
[55:19] saw one proceed forth out of the Throne
[55:21] of God it was a lamb having been slain
[55:24] notice been rest restored back to the
[55:27] place of righteousness John did not see
[55:30] a sinner John did not see a serpent I
[55:34] wish somebody would preach with me
[55:35] tonight John did not see an unrighteous
[55:39] person standing there or a man who took
[55:42] the sin of the world but John said a
[55:45] lamb come amen a lamb come and took that
[55:50] book out of the right hand of him that
[55:52] sat upon the throne and when he did the
[55:55] witness is fell down oh glory to God
[55:59] what was it he walked back through the
[56:01] gate of the city where your inheritance
[56:04] like let me tell you tonight Church your
[56:06] inheritance ain't in Johnson City it's
[56:09] not in the United States it's not in an
[56:12] America it's not in Canada your
[56:14] inheritance was in heaven and the Lord
[56:18] Jesus walked right through the gate and
[56:20] said I have completed the task I have
[56:23] paid the price now I want my bride book
[56:27] I want my bride's
[56:30] [Applause]
[56:34] inheritance oh praise the
[56:37] Lord and I I think that we as a people
[56:40] of God and we could ever come to this
[56:44] simple
[56:45] realization we do not belong to
[56:51] ourselves praise the Lord but we belong
[56:55] to him
[56:57] because he purchases read with me in 1
[56:59] Corinthians 6:20 for ye are bought with
[57:03] a price therefore glorify God in your
[57:08] body and in your
[57:12] spirit which are
[57:16] yours y'all don't believe that they're
[57:19] yours but why do we claim them why do we
[57:22] act like they're ours why do we act like
[57:25] that we are the B B of our body if I
[57:27] want to look this way do this say that
[57:29] act this way I'm going to do it and
[57:30] ain't nobody going to tell me what to do
[57:32] now you're acting like you're the boss
[57:34] now you're acting like you own you but
[57:37] you don't own you not if you're bride
[57:40] now now if you're L to seea and foolish
[57:43] virgins and you know whatever more then
[57:45] yeah go ahead but if we're bride we are
[57:48] not our own for you are bought with a
[57:51] price therefore glorify God in your body
[57:53] and in your spirit which are God
[57:56] 7: 23 ye are bought with a price be not
[58:01] ye the Servants of men are you realize
[58:04] how much easier that we could all make
[58:07] our lives as Christians and brothers and
[58:09] sisters in serving the lord if we would
[58:11] come to that realization and keep it
[58:13] before us every day of Our Lives because
[58:16] a lot of our battles in serving the lord
[58:19] has to do with procession rights of who
[58:22] really owns us and if the Lord then
[58:25] orchestrates something in our life that
[58:27] we don't understand and we have a hard
[58:29] time then what do a lot of people do
[58:31] they want to assert well I don't
[58:33] understand why you did this why would
[58:34] you do this to me this is not fair this
[58:37] is not right this is you know on and on
[58:39] and on we go and why do we do that is
[58:42] because we've not fully committed yet to
[58:45] this aspect right here that we do not
[58:47] belong to ourself we are owned by
[58:50] almighty God he bought us he paid for us
[58:54] he done everything that was needed and
[58:57] we are his property so if he wants to
[59:01] raise us up he can do it if he wants to
[59:03] push us down he can if he wants to heal
[59:05] us he can if he wants to let us go by
[59:07] the way of the Grave he can do that and
[59:09] we shouldn't say
[59:12] anything but that's the part we struggle
[59:16] with notice this the prophet goes on to
[59:18] say man is not a property of the church
[59:21] neither is man a property of the state
[59:23] but man is property of God Sons and
[59:26] Daughters of God we belong to him
[59:28] because we are bought with a price and
[59:31] what a precious price the Son of God now
[59:34] we are bought but think of it now unlike
[59:38] things that you would buy with your
[59:40] money uh we are bought with something
[59:44] that is not separate from what we
[59:46] actually are now let me let me make sure
[59:48] you understand it that in order to have
[59:51] a currency which would be spendable for
[59:54] a soul God must have a currency which
[59:58] would be able to be used in a way in the
[1:00:01] Bank of Heaven I've told you in
[1:00:03] traveling around the world and all and
[1:00:04] many places I go I don't necessarily
[1:00:06] need to change money but in some places
[1:00:09] they won't take the US dollar and some
[1:00:12] places they won't take a credit card so
[1:00:14] you will change it say in Israel you
[1:00:16] change it to shekels and and uh in China
[1:00:18] you change it to a different in Zimbabwe
[1:00:20] you change it to Zim which is Zimbabwe
[1:00:22] dollars and you change it to different
[1:00:24] places and then they will always of
[1:00:26] course exact a usually amount out of
[1:00:29] that for you so you walk in there you
[1:00:31] may have $5,000 in your pocket but they
[1:00:33] say oh no we don't take US Dollars well
[1:00:36] if you've got a need then you've got to
[1:00:38] change something in order to be able to
[1:00:41] get what you need God had a need for his
[1:00:45] attributes to be expressed and the bank
[1:00:48] of Heaven would not take sinful dollars
[1:00:51] it would not take Zimbabwe sinful
[1:00:53] dollars American sinful dollars we'd say
[1:00:56] so God had to create a currency that
[1:00:59] would be able to be acknowledged by the
[1:01:02] individuals on the earth and they would
[1:01:04] have to accept it and then it would also
[1:01:06] be honored in the Bank Of Heaven by
[1:01:09] which the recipients of that currency
[1:01:11] could be released from their debt y all
[1:01:13] follow me tonight now he knew we could
[1:01:16] not do it on our own so we don't work
[1:01:17] for it we don't go out and work a week's
[1:01:19] wages and God said well if you do this
[1:01:21] and this and this and I'll give you this
[1:01:23] much and then you can trade that in for
[1:01:25] your salvation no I don't work for one
[1:01:27] ounce of my salvation it's a free gift
[1:01:30] from almighty God but I work after I'm
[1:01:33] saved because I love him so God gave me
[1:01:37] then and you this currency which the
[1:01:40] bank of Heaven is the only currency that
[1:01:42] it will recognize it will not recognize
[1:01:44] denominational currency it won't
[1:01:46] recognize your Works your good efforts
[1:01:48] all of that nope it will not work at all
[1:01:51] so God himself must change himself into
[1:01:54] a currency which will be accepted back
[1:01:57] by his own bank so what did he do he con
[1:02:00] and sined into this low State and he
[1:02:03] changed himself in currency so he paid
[1:02:06] himself in Son of God form he paid
[1:02:10] himself Spirit form with this currency
[1:02:13] of sunship that's the way the
[1:02:15] reconciliation price was made God paid
[1:02:17] it in the form of sunship everybody
[1:02:20] follow me the form of sunship was the
[1:02:23] condescended act of God by which he
[1:02:26] would use so the spirit as John saw it
[1:02:29] he saw a lamb come out of the Throne of
[1:02:31] God not another God but it was the same
[1:02:34] God in a form which was accepted so then
[1:02:38] when you and I receive that in the
[1:02:40] fullness of its atonement then we need
[1:02:43] salvation okay but there's the currency
[1:02:45] you need healing well there's the
[1:02:47] currency to pay for well whenever we go
[1:02:49] on then those who receive the fullness
[1:02:51] of the word they're going to need a body
[1:02:53] change well you know what you've already
[1:02:55] got the currency living inside of you
[1:02:57] right now it's already there every time
[1:03:00] you get a Divine Healing that is a
[1:03:02] little bit of a miniature body change in
[1:03:04] you right then every miracle that we've
[1:03:07] seen happen in our church it's a little
[1:03:09] it's a little small but very very
[1:03:12] significant a very small form or down
[1:03:15] payment of the body change every Divine
[1:03:17] Healing that God does every day we live
[1:03:20] by this currency that he's given us
[1:03:23] aren't you grateful and think of it we
[1:03:26] were poor lost wretched Sinners but he
[1:03:29] loved us so much and he settled it at
[1:03:31] the gate now the price was paid to
[1:03:33] Calvary but he must come back into his
[1:03:36] own gate of his own City and be able to
[1:03:40] take now the book and let there be
[1:03:43] Witnesses now according to Jewish law
[1:03:44] there had to be at least 10 but he
[1:03:46] wanted to double that times four and
[1:03:48] then he would have 24 Witnesses 12 from
[1:03:51] the Old Testament 12 from the new and
[1:03:53] there they were in theophanic appearance
[1:03:55] and they stood there when he walks up
[1:03:57] before the Throne of God and takes the
[1:03:59] book and then everybody starts falling
[1:04:02] down and worshiping God and praising God
[1:04:05] blessed art thou because thou has
[1:04:07] redeemed us to God by thy blood and out
[1:04:10] of every Kindred and tongue and nation
[1:04:12] and people and thou Hast made us unto
[1:04:15] our God Kings and Priests and we shall
[1:04:18] reign on the earth what are they doing
[1:04:20] they're having this great time of
[1:04:22] rejoicing in the gate of the city just
[1:04:25] like they did with Boaz so when Boaz
[1:04:28] comes up and takes the price and he
[1:04:31] exchanges the currency over to Toad and
[1:04:34] to admits it and to has to go ahead and
[1:04:36] take his shoe off and hand it over to
[1:04:38] Boaz and as a said sometimes it would
[1:04:41] just be the seller doing it sometimes it
[1:04:43] would be the seller and the buyer and
[1:04:45] whenever he took his shoe off that
[1:04:47] signified I will no more set my foot on
[1:04:51] your property that's exactly what we
[1:04:53] need to tell the devil tonight too the
[1:04:56] devil bothering you with high blood
[1:04:57] pressure the devil bothering you with
[1:04:59] back pain or kidney stones or whatever
[1:05:01] it is you're going through you need to
[1:05:03] remind the Devil he's one barefooted
[1:05:06] devil and he better not be walking on
[1:05:08] your property because you'll have spiked
[1:05:10] Nails stuck up on the perimeter so devil
[1:05:13] if you want to come on come on come on
[1:05:16] if you want to walk out our property but
[1:05:18] remember you're barefooted and we're
[1:05:19] going to remind you you're walking on
[1:05:22] our property and our signs are posted
[1:05:24] everywhere no trespassing and we have
[1:05:28] fouly in the court of God's Judiciary
[1:05:31] and if we get sick and if I ain't got
[1:05:33] enough Faith to make this thing leave me
[1:05:35] I'm going to go before the Elders of the
[1:05:37] church and they're going to pray for me
[1:05:39] and they're going to set me free by the
[1:05:40] power of God oh you say brother Donny
[1:05:42] that's a big mouthful it is and let me
[1:05:44] add another mouthful with it the prophet
[1:05:47] said the army of the devil put sickness
[1:05:49] on you and the army of God takes it off
[1:05:52] we're not here to play with the devil
[1:05:54] we're not here to play church I don't
[1:05:56] know about you tonight I've come to have
[1:05:58] real church I've come to lay hands on
[1:06:01] the sick I've come to lay hands on those
[1:06:03] that are bound and watch them walk up
[1:06:05] here bound but watch them walk away free
[1:06:08] by the power of God why because it was
[1:06:11] settled in the gate of the city our Boaz
[1:06:16] went Before the Throne of God and took
[1:06:19] the book of our inheritance and the
[1:06:22] elders in heaven fell down before him
[1:06:25] and said Thou Art Worthy thou are worthy
[1:06:29] I'll say the same thing tonight he is
[1:06:32] worthy he is worthy oh Hallelujah that
[1:06:37] I've got everything I need right now in
[1:06:40] my soul for the rest of my journey for
[1:06:43] however long I
[1:06:45] live
[1:06:47] woo hallelujah
[1:06:53] hallelujah now watch this I love the way
[1:06:55] the goes into this about the life and
[1:06:57] the blood Rebecca and Isaac were blood
[1:07:01] relation
[1:07:03] cousins oh
[1:07:05] my and the Bride of Jesus
[1:07:12] Christ is blood
[1:07:15] relation to him a blood bought
[1:07:21] bride now you see this is another thing
[1:07:24] theologically where we differ with most
[1:07:26] of Christendom in the day that we live
[1:07:30] in that we know there was not enough
[1:07:34] chemistry in the body of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:37] always shed one drop for me and how is
[1:07:39] that impossible how is that possible
[1:07:41] rather there was not enough chemistry in
[1:07:43] his body to shed one drop that's the
[1:07:46] carnal mind that looks at still the
[1:07:48] natural side of the chemistry and the
[1:07:52] blood was so
[1:07:53] important but the cken is not the
[1:07:58] blood oh I know there's message
[1:08:00] preachers that preach contrary to that
[1:08:02] but the message preachers are
[1:08:03] wrong they're not preaching the message
[1:08:06] that's the problem they're not preaching
[1:08:08] the message the prophet tells us it was
[1:08:12] thought to be the chemistry of the blood
[1:08:17] but when the blood cell broke open it
[1:08:20] released what more chemistry the life
[1:08:25] the to token life the token life of God
[1:08:29] so all it would have been necessary my
[1:08:31] friends was for him to shed one drop of
[1:08:34] blood he didn't even have to shed out
[1:08:37] all the pints of blood that was in his
[1:08:39] body how many ever was there all he
[1:08:41] needed to do was one blood cell to be
[1:08:44] broke open that's where life started
[1:08:46] don't you understand it didn't start
[1:08:48] with five pints in Mary's womb it
[1:08:50] started with one cell when God created
[1:08:53] himself Lord have mercy when God created
[1:08:56] himself in a virgin womb you imagine he
[1:09:00] spoke and he followed the trajectory of
[1:09:02] his own word and he himself got inside
[1:09:06] her womb by the spoken word and it
[1:09:09] started from one blood cell which did
[1:09:11] not come from Mary and did not come from
[1:09:14] Joseph but it come from himself he
[1:09:18] deposited in a human bank that which
[1:09:22] would be necessary to pay the price for
[1:09:25] our
[1:09:26] sins
[1:09:28] Hallelujah if he would have shed one
[1:09:31] drop of blood only one
[1:09:33] drop that would have been enough power
[1:09:36] in that one drop to save all the
[1:09:39] billions of people that live on the face
[1:09:41] of the Earth if that accept
[1:09:43] it amen and when the blood cell started
[1:09:47] there then it was broke at Calvary what
[1:09:50] did it release Zoe so out of that tiny
[1:09:54] tiny droplet of his blood was
[1:09:58] released the
[1:10:05] godhead you don't see it yet no no you
[1:10:10] don't one day you
[1:10:12] will it'll turn you inside
[1:10:15] out when you do the word
[1:10:19] Theos
[1:10:21] Theos which is a Greek word for deity
[1:10:25] the
[1:10:27] godhead yeah I'll wait on
[1:10:30] that but once you
[1:10:33] see there's a part of God in you that
[1:10:38] was there before there was any molecules
[1:10:41] or
[1:10:42] time that's the
[1:10:44] redeemable
[1:10:47] part notice he says the life is in the
[1:10:51] blood and the life is in the church the
[1:10:53] Christian that's born again by the
[1:10:55] spirit of God that's the spirit of Life
[1:10:59] blood
[1:11:01] relation to Christ and the spirit of
[1:11:05] Christ is the blood of Christ leading a
[1:11:09] child of Christ The Seed of Abraham
[1:11:12] that's why they move peculiarly well
[1:11:16] Glory that's why the world think so
[1:11:20] strange of them so don't just think it's
[1:11:23] you uh-uh it's the blood of Jesus your
[1:11:26] blood relation to God Lord willing
[1:11:29] Sunday I want to speak to you on another
[1:11:33] right that God's give you like a little
[1:11:36] Prelude on it it's the right to be
[1:11:41] married to
[1:11:44] God thank you Lord it's as far as I'm
[1:11:47] going with it so don't try to pull it
[1:11:48] out of
[1:11:50] me but before he can make this
[1:11:53] transaction remember he want wants a
[1:11:55] legal
[1:11:58] marriage her husband is
[1:12:01] dead but there's still a claim on

[1:12:18] changed from Roost the
[1:12:22] moabitas to roost the
[1:12:25] wife with boas
[1:12:29] amen if he can buy
[1:12:32] her and release her at the Gate of his
[1:12:38] City he will change her name
[1:12:44] forever notice this the prophet
[1:12:47] said he's absolutely legal defeated in
[1:12:51] every place now remember to's ride had
[1:12:53] to be forfeited and the Devil's right's
[1:12:55] got to be forfeited with a claim on you

[1:14:43] all
[1:14:46] nowhere he's
[1:14:48] just a
[1:14:53] devil he's just
[1:14:56] a
[1:14:57] devil and the
[1:15:01] password I find that so
[1:15:04] unusual a
[1:15:07] password that's all he hasn't got no
[1:15:10] legal right to any man that'll accept
[1:15:13] the promise of Jesus Christ he's
[1:15:17] whipped oh Hallelujah yes sir he's

[1:15:40] you and that's all he is is a big old
[1:15:44] Shadow a big old
[1:15:51] Shadow now let me show you tonight
[1:15:53] there's only one way way that Satan has
[1:15:57] got any legal right against you only one
[1:16:04] way as long as he's got an unconfessed
[1:16:08] sin something that you ought to have
[1:16:11] done or ought not have done you could
[1:16:15] anoint him with oil you can do anything
[1:16:17] you wish to he will not leave that's
[1:16:22] right he has a legal right
[1:16:25] to hold
[1:16:28] there this is the only way
[1:16:31] friends that Satan will not move if
[1:16:35] there's something in our life we should
[1:16:37] have done something in our life we
[1:16:39] shouldn't have done I can pray for you
[1:16:41] brother the D can pray for you every man
[1:16:43] of God can pray for you anoint you we
[1:16:44] can do all that we can jump and Shout
[1:16:46] around you we can March around Jericho
[1:16:48] Till There is no
[1:16:51] Jericho but he knows his rights on and
[1:16:55] he knows if there's any unconfessed sin
[1:16:59] and we're coming up for prayer he'll s
[1:17:01] right there and he'll laugh in my face
[1:17:03] while I'm praying for you he'll life in
[1:17:06] your
[1:17:08] face but if we can make everything right
[1:17:12] it'll be us doing the
[1:17:15] life now remember this is from a servant
[1:17:19] of
[1:17:20] God who cast out
[1:17:23] Devils by the
[1:17:27] thousands the fourth dimension was a
[1:17:30] realm that we knew very little
[1:17:34] about God sent prophets in different
[1:17:37] areas and they were like a window to the
[1:17:40] supernatural so it was like the wall
[1:17:44] into the fourth dimension would be like
[1:17:46] this we could see nothing we don't know
[1:17:48] if it's wide outside dark outside cars
[1:17:51] passing by we don't know we can't see
[1:17:53] anything but then every now then God
[1:17:55] would send a prophet and he would cut a
[1:17:57] hole out and God would place a prophetic
[1:18:00] gift in that wall of time and then we
[1:18:03] could look through the wall and say oh
[1:18:06] my oh look that look look at that look
[1:18:10] oh my oh wow oh oh my and then God would
[1:18:14] take that Prophet from the earth and the
[1:18:15] wall would go solid again then didn't
[1:18:18] send another and another and
[1:18:21] another but in the last days for
[1:18:23] whatever reason I mean God cut a picture
[1:18:34] window and kicked it
[1:18:37] out and exposed the devil and hear them
[1:18:39] Devils
[1:18:46] was they were being seen for the first
[1:18:50] time since to fall in the Garden of Eden
[1:18:53] the way they were showed now when Jesus
[1:18:54] so here he give us a little bit of you
[1:18:57] but for whatever reason God chose the
[1:18:59] last days he's going to expose that
[1:19:01] devil can you imagine a man standing in
[1:19:03] the platform and he hears these demons
[1:19:05] as they're
[1:19:07] talking he hears them as they are
[1:19:10] screaming can't you hear them he says
[1:19:14] they're saying keep them from believing
[1:19:17] keep them from believing so he are these
[1:19:19] demons in the fourth dimension faith is
[1:19:21] building in the service and he's sharing
[1:19:24] this conflict going on I said the angels
[1:19:26] of God are here and the demons are here
[1:19:29] and there's a great Warfare going on he
[1:19:30] said how will it end it will depend on
[1:19:33] what you
[1:19:35] believe so for the first time this big
[1:19:38] piece of glass opened
[1:19:41] up and we've got a a human being
[1:19:44] standing there said can you see
[1:19:48] that can you see that
[1:19:50] streak it went from this woman here on
[1:19:53] the platform that man back there the
[1:19:55] same thing it's a
[1:19:57] cancer he's screaming help
[1:20:01] me help
[1:20:04] me I've often wondering when them demons
[1:20:06] got back in hell that one that told on
[1:20:08] the other they must had the office fight
[1:20:10] ever was can you imagine they got down I
[1:20:12] said what in the work you do that for I
[1:20:14] was HD I thought I was head pretty good
[1:20:15] you I remember Hell is offest mess ever
[1:20:18] was remember what hell is built on
[1:20:20] division contention can you imagine what
[1:20:24] it's like in hell well look around here
[1:20:26] and you get a pretty good idea except
[1:20:27] it's a lot worse down there but imagine
[1:20:29] how can there ever be a kingdom so
[1:20:31] whether it's a kingdom a family or
[1:20:32] church or whatever it is and it's built
[1:20:34] upon splitting like like heaven was or
[1:20:37] it's built upon the personality of of
[1:20:39] another monarchy that wants to have a
[1:20:41] great trone and you imagine down there
[1:20:43] the darkness and the fussing the prophet
[1:20:45] said what causes war in the world is
[1:20:47] because those Spirits so the spirit of
[1:20:50] Russia hates the spirit of America and
[1:20:52] it's evident that the spirit of a lot of
[1:20:55] those in the UN hates the spirit on
[1:20:59] Israel come on somebody and they cannot
[1:21:02] stand that Spirit on Israel and they get
[1:21:05] jealous of one another and they hate one
[1:21:07] another and and for the first time since
[1:21:09] man had stepped out of the Garden of
[1:21:11] Eden were able to peer into that realm
[1:21:14] and hear what they're
[1:21:16] saying and the prophet said he'd go back
[1:21:18] to the motel room at night and your
[1:21:20] chains rattling all night long
[1:21:25] and them demons would come into his
[1:21:26] hotel room and their flesh would rub his
[1:21:34] flesh I don't mind telling you I'm glad
[1:21:36] I ain't made to deal with that sort of
[1:21:39] thing I wouldn't have to worry about too
[1:21:41] much of it cuz I'd pass out cold in the
[1:21:43] wedge I'd wake up sometime in the
[1:21:45] morning and say what happened what
[1:21:47] happened aren't you glad you don't Oh
[1:21:50] Brother Don I'm terrified I'm terrified
[1:21:51] don't tell me that don't worry God will
[1:21:53] never let you deal with what you cannot
[1:21:55] deal with but what did God do he put
[1:21:57] this big gigantic picture window but he
[1:22:00] didn't just let us go to see
[1:22:04] hell but as he was sitting in his
[1:22:07] bed and he kind of raised up and put his
[1:22:10] hands behind his bed thinking of that
[1:22:12] song I am Lonesome oh so lonesome like
[1:22:16] to look past the curtain of time would
[1:22:19] you like to see oh yes I believe it but
[1:22:22] help me so much
[1:22:25] and all of a sudden I felt myself leing
[1:22:27] my body and I looked over at my wife and
[1:22:29] I looked up above myself and there I was
[1:22:32] about 20
[1:22:34] feet from my
[1:22:37] body and I looked and here come all of
[1:22:39] these people running it looked like
[1:22:43] millions of
[1:22:46] them and the sisters was the ones that
[1:22:49] got to him
[1:22:51] first all of them was that long
[1:22:53] beautiful hair hanging down their back
[1:22:56] long robes
[1:22:58] on
[1:22:59] screaming our precious
[1:23:02] brother our precious
[1:23:05] brother then Here Come Those young men
[1:23:09] long shaggy hair
[1:23:12] wow and they were screaming our precious
[1:23:15] brother our precious
[1:23:18] brother and they reached down and pick
[1:23:20] me up and set me up kind of high said
[1:23:23] why'd you do that
[1:23:25] you as a
[1:23:26] leader in
[1:23:29] life oh I I want to see
[1:23:34] Jesus me and Carol was telling about
[1:23:36] this
[1:23:37] week she said I wonder
[1:23:40] what what Erica and all them saints are
[1:23:43] up there doing I said I don't know honey
[1:23:46] I don't I don't know it's not like they
[1:23:48] have a schedule it's not like they have
[1:23:51] events that they have to attend and go
[1:23:53] to
[1:23:55] I said but can you imagine Carol what a
[1:23:56] place that sixth Dimension must
[1:23:59] be that it is a place of such happiness
[1:24:02] and
[1:24:03] Bliss that he said if I've died I want
[1:24:06] to see
[1:24:08] Jesus and the voice answered and said
[1:24:11] you can't see him
[1:24:13] now he's a little bit
[1:24:16] higher and that took care of
[1:24:19] it wow I mean you'd think you'd be so
[1:24:22] sad and so lonely I want to see Jesus I
[1:24:25] want to see Jesus but it's not that
[1:24:28] sixth Dimension has its own
[1:24:30] Comforts and he still a seen Jesus yet
[1:24:34] but he went to finding trying to find
[1:24:36] adjectives to describe the place and he
[1:24:38] said perfect million miles beyond that
[1:24:41] Sublime be beyond that I don't know if a
[1:24:43] word in the English language he said
[1:24:46] that would describe it other than you've
[1:24:52] arrived wonder why of all the I Paul was
[1:24:55] carried up I knew a man about 14 years
[1:24:57] ago when they're in the body they're out
[1:24:58] of the body I cannot tell but such a one
[1:25:00] was carried up into the third heavens
[1:25:02] and heard things that was not lawful for
[1:25:04] a man to utter so what it was that Paul
[1:25:05] experienced he couldn't even come back
[1:25:07] and tell his people why his time was not
[1:25:10] the Rapture
[1:25:12] age but God let our messenger one go
[1:25:15] over and be able to come back with some
[1:25:18] grapes amen praise the Lord come back
[1:25:21] and say I'll never be the same brother
[1:25:23] brandom again again I'll never be the
[1:25:25] same one and Not only was he able to
[1:25:27] peer into that realm and see all of that
[1:25:30] but also break into the Angelic realm
[1:25:33] not just the angels of God like Gabriel
[1:25:36] and W woodworm and all of
[1:25:38] those but your
[1:25:43] angel cuz you remember when he come back
[1:25:45] down and a few years after that
[1:25:46] translation in 1960 he
[1:25:50] said I was able to look over there that
[1:25:53] morning and I saw all of you
[1:25:56] all
[1:26:02] there that's why I feel so sorry for
[1:26:05] those who have took a stand against this
[1:26:09] message I feel so sorry for them may
[1:26:13] God help
[1:26:15] them to come back and realize no doubt
[1:26:18] some's cross the line you and I don't
[1:26:20] know who that is you got family members
[1:26:22] there pray for them that God God will
[1:26:24] help them to come to their
[1:26:27] senses think what God did to open up
[1:26:31] that sphere and be able to watch these
[1:26:35] demons and see them as he tells us in
[1:26:39] the church age book whenever he would go
[1:26:41] to Discerning and the spirit of God
[1:26:43] would move upon him and he would watch
[1:26:45] the countenance of their face change
[1:26:47] because he said Satan is
[1:26:51] afraid you see we never knew that
[1:26:55] he said Satan is afraid to be
[1:26:59] exposed and he said that will reflect on
[1:27:01] the countenance of the people so they'll
[1:27:03] go to acting really funny and behaving
[1:27:05] funny because that Spirit that's
[1:27:07] dominating their life or their faith or
[1:27:09] their body it'll become so apprehensive
[1:27:11] and so tore up and here what was it a
[1:27:14] window end the supernatural oh but how
[1:27:16] would he tell oh you're a Christian I
[1:27:18] know you're a Christian say okay now
[1:27:20] your higher sister is 28 Ines down from
[1:27:22] the crown up here down and I see that
[1:27:24] your high heels is under 2 Ines so
[1:27:25] you're good there and I see your dresses
[1:27:27] Y come on down past the the out about 3
[1:27:29] in yeah you're good okay that wouldn't
[1:27:31] way tell him that's Christians but he
[1:27:33] said I see you're a Christian because
[1:27:35] it's light around you so he was reading
[1:27:39] demons he was reading Angels he was
[1:27:42] reading Christians by what pulsations of
[1:27:46] light or Darkness you see every one of
[1:27:49] us have an appearance every one of us
[1:27:53] have a story that story of your life is
[1:27:56] not just your mortality it is whether
[1:27:59] you are light or
[1:28:08] Darkness I want you to listen to
[1:28:13] this but I in your command
[1:28:18] tonight I come to represent your
[1:28:20] vicarious suffering as talking to the
[1:28:23] Lord Lord in
[1:28:25] prayer I in your command tonight I come
[1:28:29] to represent your vicarious suffering
[1:28:31] and death at Calvary who
[1:28:34] stripped and
[1:28:38] robbed
[1:28:41] Satan of every legal
[1:28:44] right he
[1:28:49] had he is
[1:28:51] only a bluff
[1:28:54] amen
[1:28:55] amen and he's
[1:28:57] exposed tonight
[1:28:59] amen can't you understand friends why he
[1:29:02] hates this
[1:29:04] message why is it that this
[1:29:07] message is hated so
[1:29:12] much it's unbelievable the small amount
[1:29:15] of percentage of the people on the Earth
[1:29:17] that even believe it and accept it why
[1:29:21] don't the infidels and the unbelievers
[1:29:23] and many of those that have turned and
[1:29:24] walked away why don't they fight the
[1:29:26] Bible the way they fight the message why
[1:29:29] don't they fight Catholicism which is
[1:29:32] killed millions of people right have
[1:29:34] y'all ever heard me teach you how to
[1:29:36] kill anybody have we ever martyred
[1:29:39] anyone here at our church do we do what
[1:29:43] the denominations has done why is this
[1:29:46] message hated so much because Satan
[1:29:49] knows if he can stop the men of God from
[1:29:52] preaching the message of the hour oh I
[1:29:54] know some of our compromising so-called
[1:29:56] message preachers they're reverting back
[1:29:59] to preaching the same Bible stories
[1:30:01] that's been preached for decades uhhuh
[1:30:03] and I'd like to remind you them same
[1:30:05] Bible stories preached under the light
[1:30:07] of the day gone by never did produce a
[1:30:10] Rapture and it won't produce one now
[1:30:12] unless we preach some same Bible stories
[1:30:15] under the anointing of Malachi 4 then we
[1:30:19] preach Daniel and the Lion's then it's
[1:30:21] under a different anointing we preach
[1:30:23] some of the same Bible stories Harry but
[1:30:25] we're preaching it under the anointing
[1:30:28] of Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10
[1:30:32] and it will Usher in a change of the
[1:30:35] body because the anointing has
[1:30:40] changed it's no wonder Satan don't want
[1:30:43] the message
[1:30:48] preached pardon me
[1:30:54] just an update you'll never stop
[1:31:00] it
[1:31:07] never and Boaz the king of the
[1:31:11] Harvest the lord of the Harvest goes
[1:31:13] outside the gates calls the Elders of
[1:31:16] the city and makes a public testimony
[1:31:18] outside the
[1:31:19] gate all of you people took off a shoe
[1:31:22] and kicked it off before them at a
[1:31:24] testimony and said I this day have
[1:31:27] redeemed all of Naomi's lost
[1:31:30] Heritage and all of her possessions is
[1:31:33] mine this
[1:31:37] day let me just say
[1:31:43] it our government may turn against
[1:31:45] Israel and they
[1:31:47] will France may turn against
[1:31:50] Israel Britain may turn against Israel
[1:31:56] turkey has already cut off relations
[1:31:58] with
[1:31:59] them the UAE Saudi Arabia Egypt
[1:32:04] different ones of them are making
[1:32:07] threats And if every nation under Heaven
[1:32:11] turns against
[1:32:13] her who are they compared to he who
[1:32:18] rides on a white
[1:32:21] horse wo
[1:32:24] Oh
[1:32:25] Glory I'm talking about the Prince of
[1:32:28] Peace the bright and The Morning Star
[1:32:31] you see my King has power to split
[1:32:40] mountains my king Iran you know they
[1:32:43] think they got really really smart
[1:32:45] because they divided their nuclear
[1:32:47] capabilities and they've got part of
[1:32:49] them buried under this mountain in Iran
[1:32:51] and part of them buried under that
[1:32:53] mountain in Iran and this mountain in
[1:32:55] Iran and America is the only one that
[1:32:58] has a bomb that they think can even
[1:33:01] halfway penetrate that mountain and that
[1:33:04] is one that whenever they drop it it
[1:33:06] does not explode whenever it hits the
[1:33:08] ground but it actually goes and buries
[1:33:11] itself down in the mountain and then
[1:33:14] after it's down in there for how many
[1:33:15] ever hundreds of feet then it will
[1:33:18] explode and they hope that it will take
[1:33:21] care of Iran's nuclear stud but let me
[1:33:24] tell you one thing I ain't a hoping
[1:33:26] tonight I ain't a hoping that my Jesus
[1:33:28] has got enough power I've done red in
[1:33:31] the back of the Bible in the Book of
[1:33:32] Revelation I've done read at the end of
[1:33:35] the prophecy of the Old Testament I
[1:33:37] found where Zachariah said that he will
[1:33:40] stand there upon that mountain and when
[1:33:42] he does it will split and hide and you
[1:33:45] will run to me as you did in the days of
[1:33:48] AEL it will make a valley down through
[1:33:51] there and the king of kings and Lord
[1:33:53] Lords will come to get whever of them's
[1:33:57] alive of that 144,000 and he will stand
[1:34:01] there and all the bombs of the world
[1:34:03] won't stop it all the f35s and the F-22
[1:34:07] and the machine guns and the Hand
[1:34:09] Grenade cuz you can't kill my Jesus no
[1:34:12] more the price has done been paid but
[1:34:15] once he paid the price he got back into
[1:34:18] the righteous form Hallelujah he entered
[1:34:22] back into the deity before and you
[1:34:24] better look out devil cuz he told John I
[1:34:28] am he that was dead but I am alive
[1:34:32] forever more I was dead but I won't die
[1:34:35] again I am the resurrection I am the
[1:34:39] life I am the Healer I'm the alpha Oh

[1:35:11] Israel LED outside the gates watch him
[1:35:14] now the purchase price was paid outside
[1:35:18] the gates made a testimony wounded for
[1:35:21] our transgressions whether stripes are
[1:35:23] healed a public testimony he redeemed
[1:35:26] the church from what a lost
[1:35:31] estate and the Garden of Eden we didn't
[1:35:33] have any sickness the Garden of Eden we
[1:35:36] had no sin the Garden of Eden we had no
[1:35:38] death God so loved the world he gave his
[1:35:40] only begotten son and made a
[1:35:44] testimony outside the
[1:35:49] gate but let me just give you a little
[1:35:51] heads up for Sunday
[1:35:56] he was the only begotten
[1:35:58] son but he's not the only one
[1:36:07] now
[1:36:10] Hallelujah glory to God glory to God he
[1:36:13] redeemed man to everything he lost in

[1:36:46] he redeemed her back everything she had
[1:36:50] plucked off his shoe and made a public
[1:36:52] inside that all that come in and out
[1:36:55] might know that he had redeemed
[1:36:57] everything na only lost and he was in
[1:37:00] full
[1:37:04] possession what did Jesus do to do it he
[1:37:08] made a public testimony when Satan could
[1:37:11] not die for sins because he was The
[1:37:17] Sinner he's the father of sin but Jesus
[1:37:21] the innocent one God Of Heaven
[1:37:24] who didn't have to die come down and
[1:37:25] made a public testimony by dying lifted
[1:37:29] up between the heavens and the earth a
[1:37:31] public testimony stripped his clothes
[1:37:33] off of him and hung between the heavens
[1:37:35] and the Earth in shame and died a sinful
[1:37:40] shameful
[1:37:42] deaths can't you see why he couldn't
[1:37:44] take the book of Redemption on the
[1:37:47] cross he died the death of a
[1:37:51] sinner he had to wait till he was
[1:37:55] righteous
[1:38:01] again what did he do kicked
[1:38:05] off his own
[1:38:09] righteousness kicked off his own
[1:38:12] glory Lord have
[1:38:15] mercy and he asked you to give up
[1:38:18] cigarettes he asked you to give up
[1:38:20] something worldly and ungodly and we
[1:38:23] belly at and cry like it's something
[1:38:25] terrible can you imagine becoming from
[1:38:29] God it would have been what a transition
[1:38:32] to be come from God to man yes sir but
[1:38:35] to come from God to be a
[1:38:45] sinner I have power I could speak to my
[1:38:48] father and straight way had send me 20
[1:38:49] Legions of angels but he kicked that off
[1:38:53] he laid God aside he laid aside all of
[1:38:55] his dignity everything aside and become
[1:38:58] a
[1:39:00] sinner and died for you and
[1:39:04] I you see how Satan here in the
[1:39:06] scripture tried to make him break God's
[1:39:08] plan to receive
[1:39:09] it give it to him when he took him up on
[1:39:12] the mountain and tried to give it to him
[1:39:13] without the purchase of the blood you
[1:39:16] want the Earth fine I own
[1:39:20] it you don't have to die a kingdom
[1:39:22] without a cal remember I preached that
[1:39:24] to you 32 years
[1:39:26] ago you don't have to die you want it
[1:39:29] I'll give it to you I'll gladly give it
[1:39:30] to you no Calvary no dying no cross no
[1:39:34] Thorns none of that none of that totally
[1:39:36] Escape every bit of it just bow to me
[1:39:39] and worship me that's all you got to
[1:39:41] do I'll give it to
[1:39:44] you oh but remember he was the
[1:39:50] word without the purchase of the blood
[1:39:52] notice Matthew for it again the devil
[1:39:54] taketh him into an exceeding high
[1:39:57] mountain can you imagine the devil
[1:39:59] having such
[1:40:01] power that by time
[1:40:04] travel he would be able to pick up the
[1:40:06] Lord Jesus from where he was and move
[1:40:13] it when the prophet reads this in the
[1:40:15] seal book he says what a
[1:40:22] creature and showed him all the kingdoms
[1:40:25] of the
[1:40:27] world and the glory of
[1:40:30] them and sayth unto him all these things
[1:40:33] will I give this that will fall down and
[1:40:34] worship
[1:40:36] me you imagine showed him all the
[1:40:39] kingdoms of world not the
[1:40:40] ghettos not the back alleys the Palaces
[1:40:45] the fine
[1:40:46] homes you want it no problem I'll give
[1:40:49] it to you I'll make a
[1:40:51] trade why cuz Satan wants to be
[1:40:54] worshiped so bad and there's nobody who
[1:40:57] wants to worship it any more than
[1:41:02] Theos
[1:41:06] deity don't you
[1:41:08] understand one child of God would mean
[1:41:12] more to him if they would bow on their
[1:41:15] knee and worship him than all of his own
[1:41:20] children
[1:41:23] because they are like
[1:41:25] him but if one son of God or one
[1:41:29] daughter of
[1:41:30] God will say Satan you're
[1:41:35] King you're God you're the great
[1:41:39] Creator he would have broke into to what
[1:41:42] he could never get to the
[1:41:48] godhead but don't hold your breath devil
[1:41:51] too long CU ain't none of them Theos
[1:41:54] kids ever going to do
[1:42:01] that then Jesus saith unto him get thee
[1:42:04] hence Satan for it is written Thou shalt
[1:42:06] Worship the Lord thy God and him only
[1:42:09] shalt thou
[1:42:11] serve let me close you a momentarily bit
[1:42:14] I want you to think of this before we
[1:42:15] close the Lord Jesus and raising
[1:42:19] Lazarus and those others in the New
[1:42:21] Testament that actually had died
[1:42:24] and he raised them from the
[1:42:27] dead but every one of them had to die
[1:42:32] again because even though they
[1:42:34] experienced a bodily
[1:42:38] resurrection that did not redeem them
[1:42:42] permanently from The
[1:42:44] Sting of
[1:42:47] death don't you understand tonight
[1:42:49] you're more
[1:42:50] blessed than Lazarus was
[1:42:53] if your
[1:42:54] soul has raised from the
[1:42:58] dead it can never die
[1:43:02] again the resurrection a resurrection
[1:43:04] from the dead that's phenomenal it's
[1:43:06] wonderful yes it is but a resurrection
[1:43:08] from the dead is not a full
[1:43:13] Redemption what happened to all them
[1:43:14] people that died in the New Testament
[1:43:16] raising from them dead every one of them
[1:43:17] died
[1:43:19] again what A peculiar feeling it must
[1:43:21] have been for Lazarus he died twice What
[1:43:23] A peculiar feeling it must have been for
[1:43:25] the Widow of name with her son and you
[1:43:27] know all these people that that that he
[1:43:28] raised in the dead so they done face
[1:43:30] death one thing he's raised up by them
[1:43:32] but because he did not redeem them from
[1:43:34] the curse of the law they had to face
[1:43:37] death twice but if you're sting here
[1:43:39] tonight with the baptism of the Holy
[1:43:41] Ghost in your soul you can never
[1:43:44] die oh but you say brother Donnie sister
[1:43:47] Erica died oh no she did
[1:43:50] not brother Donnie brother Jerry
[1:43:52] Phillips oh no he did
[1:43:55] not the coat that he lived in passed
[1:43:59] away the coat that Erica lived in passed
[1:44:02] away but Erica is alive and
[1:44:06] well she's more alive than she's
[1:44:09] everwhere brother Jim bad brother Jerry
[1:44:11] Phillips sister Naomi on and on and on
[1:44:14] we can name them here tonight they are
[1:44:16] not dead they are alive Hallelujah and
[1:44:22] can never never die
[1:44:27] again think of it as
[1:44:30] powerful as a resurrection is do you
[1:44:33] understand that people could get
[1:44:35] miracles in their
[1:44:36] body that don't mean that they'll have
[1:44:38] eternal life people could get healed in
[1:44:41] their body and still wind up being
[1:44:44] lost but if you're standing here tonight
[1:44:47] and your soul has been redeemed praise
[1:44:49] God that is the greatest of all miracles
[1:44:53] amen oh my don't you appreciate the Lord
[1:44:57] Jesus
[1:44:58] tonight amen let me read you this in the
[1:45:00] future home and then we'll close did you
[1:45:01] notice how Abraham when they tried to
[1:45:03] give him the land and he bought it with
[1:45:05] so many shekels of silver before the
[1:45:07] people as an inside as a witness let it
[1:45:10] be known this day I bought this bearing
[1:45:13] Place see purchase
[1:45:16] it Satan tried to give him the Lord
[1:45:20] Jesus the kingdom which belongs to him
[1:45:23] now he tried to give it to him as a
[1:45:27] gift you see the devil would love to
[1:45:30] give
[1:45:31] you as a gift to
[1:45:34] God as long as God don't fill you with
[1:45:37] the Holy
[1:45:39] Ghost God you want Jonathan you want
[1:45:41] Kirk you want Donnie you want all these
[1:45:43] women but sure you can have
[1:45:46] them sure I don't mind letting you have
[1:45:49] them they want to go to church fine let
[1:45:51] them get a religious par that's fine
[1:45:53] have no problem with
[1:45:55] that but God don't you get in
[1:45:59] them don't you get in
[1:46:02] them if you break that blood cell over
[1:46:05] their
[1:46:06] soul and you go in them God my chains
[1:46:11] are forever
[1:46:14] broken where would we be
[1:46:16] tonight were it not for his grace
[1:46:20] amen a hopeless case yeah I'm looking at
[1:46:24] hundreds of them here
[1:46:25] tonight let me finish this
[1:46:28] quote he tried to give it to him as a
[1:46:31] gift but he wouldn't receive it because
[1:46:34] see then Satan could still have a claim
[1:46:37] on
[1:46:38] it but it had to be
[1:46:41] bought that's why he wants to clear your
[1:46:45] deed
[1:46:47] Ruth to where you're released from the
[1:46:51] nature
[1:46:53] now remember when mean married her under
[1:46:56] the first nature in the type he married
[1:47:00] her as a
[1:47:02] moabitas which would have kept her out
[1:47:04] of the economy of
[1:47:06] God but she must be
[1:47:09] remarried to another
[1:47:12] man to be brought
[1:47:15] in to the tribes of
[1:47:20] Israel and that's why you must be be
[1:47:23] remarried
[1:47:24] again to another
[1:47:31] nature thank you Lord when you were
[1:47:36] born you was given a human name to that
[1:47:40] first
[1:47:42] nature and everything you done under
[1:47:45] that first nature was listed under that
[1:47:49] first
[1:47:51] name like ru some more about
[1:47:54] this go to church do all them good
[1:47:58] things but you don't get a new name just
[1:48:00] because you join
[1:48:01] church you've got to have another
[1:48:05] marriage so there's got to be a death to
[1:48:08] your first husband you see Boaz could
[1:48:10] not marry as long as Mayon was
[1:48:13] alive so her first husband had to be
[1:48:17] dead and if she could marry a prince in
[1:48:21] the land Maybe could not stand in the
[1:48:24] gates of the city he alienated himself
[1:48:27] across the border in the land of
[1:48:30] Moab Adam couldn't redeem us Moses
[1:48:33] couldn't take us back but there had to
[1:48:36] be a
[1:48:37] goel that was still in the land of
[1:48:41] inheritance and from the land itself he
[1:48:45] would project his
[1:48:48] love I find it to be amazing because
[1:48:52] historically they say that she
[1:48:54] was probably in her
[1:48:59] 30s and
[1:49:00] Boaz was in his
[1:49:06] 80s so that young woman married the
[1:49:11] Ancient of
[1:49:14] Days amen
[1:49:23] one of our brothers standing here
[1:49:24] tonight had a dream a while
[1:49:27] back about that
[1:49:30] Dimension he saw several people
[1:49:33] there saw brother Jim Babs he come
[1:49:35] running up to
[1:49:37] him he saw brother
[1:49:40] Cecil but it took him a little bit to
[1:49:42] recognize brother Cecil
[1:49:44] because him and brother Jimmy were the
[1:49:46] same age
[1:49:50] [Laughter]
[1:49:54] then in a little
[1:49:56] bit he saw Erica
[1:50:01] coming she come running and hollering to
[1:50:05] him praise the
[1:50:08] Lord after the visitation there and
[1:50:12] brother Jim bab took him and also Eric
[1:50:15] on the other side and telling them now
[1:50:17] you got to go back you got to go
[1:50:20] back friends they are alive tonight
[1:50:24] [Music]
[1:50:26] amen they are
[1:50:29] alive but they white

[1:51:06] blood as the
[1:51:09] atonement by which we are redeemed Lord

[1:51:18] gratitude in our
[1:51:20] hearts where would I be Lord

[1:51:29] wasn't for your grace be I turned
[1:51:31] Pentecost still running around preaching
[1:51:33] this that the other but your grace not
[1:51:36] only come to save me but you gave me
[1:51:38] more grace as you kept revealing your
[1:51:41] word thank you for this message of the
[1:51:43] end time I love it now more than I ever
[1:51:48] have I'm so grateful for it Lord
[1:51:53] dear Jesus we worship you
[1:51:57] tonight come
[1:52:00] Lord come for your
[1:52:04] Ru oh how nervous you must have been at
[1:52:07] the house waiting not sure what the
[1:52:10] outcome would
[1:52:12] be cuz she wasn't actually there before
[1:52:15] the elders when the transaction took
[1:52:19] place so to and made his claim
[1:52:23] and it seemed as if to had the upper
[1:52:27] hand but the Lord Jesus was not done
[1:52:33] yet oh what a day it must have been an
[1:52:36] awesome
[1:52:37] hour when her and Naomi got the message
[1:52:41] from the
[1:52:43] gate
[1:52:45] Boaz made the
[1:52:48] deal
[1:52:50] baz paid the price
[1:52:54] Hallelujah
[1:52:56] Hallelujah Lord Jesus we're waiting for
[1:52:59] that beckoning
[1:53:01] call for us to also be
[1:53:04] summoned up to the
[1:53:06] gate when we
[1:53:09] too hallelujah

[1:53:19] Resurrection
[1:53:20] so he lets us get get together
[1:53:24] first we'll be looking around to see if
[1:53:26] this one made it that one made
[1:53:28] it Carol asked me the other day how
[1:53:31] would that be how how could we if we
[1:53:34] didn't find our loved ones How Could
[1:53:35] That Be
[1:53:37] Heaven I said well I certainly don't
[1:53:39] have all the answers but I I don't see

[1:53:44] supper of the Lamb thinking a uncle
[1:53:46] didn't make it a sister didn't make it a
[1:53:49] niece didn't make it somehow
[1:53:53] he will erase that from our
[1:53:55] memory how could we enjoy
[1:53:58] eternity with that hanging over
[1:54:01] us but we'll all gather
[1:54:04] together I'm reminder of the dream that

[1:54:23] this throng of people and we all started
[1:54:27] worshiping and praising his
[1:54:29] name and the more we worshiped he
[1:54:33] started rising up out of that
[1:54:35] crowd and the more we praised the higher
[1:54:39] you Rose and the more we praise the
[1:54:42] higher you Rose and you Rose to where
