========================================

bear got one of his sheep and he killed that bear and a lion running and got one and he caught that bear line by the beard and Tuck a knife and kill that lion see it was sacrificing for his sheep and if he was willing to lay down his life for the Sheep he was a type of the Good Shepherd there's something that God always liked in people un sheep did you ever notice you're the sheep of the pasture sheep of one fold other sheep have I and so forth likening people unto sheep you know why he liken us to sheep did you ever did you ever fool with sheep any they are certainly educational and a Divine education to to learn of sheep I've rais Ed them and shephered them around and a little fellas but when a sheep is lost he's absolutely helpless I picked up sheep not standing maybe 300 yard from the Sheep F and where all the other sheep was and that sheep when he's lost he can't help himself he just stands there and blat and blat until the wolf gets him or something takes place he he just can't find his way back he's totally helpless without a Shepherd you know he said to Peter love me Peter more than these yeah feed my sheep now I never said drive my sheep he never said kick my sheep he said feed my sheep that's what the Sheep needs is some sheep food don't you think so you know the best sheep food I know of for you sick sheep and all kind of sheep here it is that's right in this great big bread basket of God man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God that's what the Holy Spirit lives on that's in you lives on the word of God that connection of Shepherd and sheep uh one time when I was over in the orance I learned a great lesson about I seen in St John I believe the 10th chapter where he said I am the the gate to the Sheepfold or the door to the Sheep I often wonder how could he being a man be a door but then when I was over there I learned what it meant the Shepherds Drive their sheep in to the Sheep F and they got a a arch that they go in at and when he drives them all in there then after they're all in it he counts them and if he's one lacking he'll go out and get it he has to bring it in every sheep has to be accounted for every hour of the day how OD a Shepherd he is and then after he gets them all numbered and they're all bted down the shepherd goes down but this hole where the Sheep coming at and lays himself down across the hole then no wolf can come in no Thief can come in no harm can come in Les it comes over the shepherd first what a picture of Christ laying himself down for us that nothing can harm us unless it comes over him so if you're sick you say brother brandom sickness crossed over him but it was for the glory of God that's right he wants to maybe give you a testimony as a fellow said one time he seen a shepherd with its uh packing a sheep and he said the had his leg all bandaged up he said well what did you um what's the matter did it fall off a cliff said no said I broke it leg oh he said you must be a cruel Shepherd to break your own sheep's leg said no the Sheep wouldn't mind me so I had to break her leg in order to hold her pet her and love her and give her a little special food so that she would love me and follow me and so sometime God has to do that to us let the doctor say oh it's all over nothing give be done and then God takes you up his arm and Pats you a little bit say child of M don't you know I love you don't you know I'm the Lord that even all I but Lord I was taught that the days of I know you was but I just had to let this happen so I could just show you a little special favor now don't you love me just a little more now I'm going to let you get well did you ever had that just come to you I have many times had something happened just to check me down a little to let him Express his love now another thing you notice about sheep and the shepherd you know it's a disgrace for the shepherd to lose one sheep did you know that it's a reproach on the shepherd now I whole quiet now hallelujah oh yes sir if the shepherd l loses one sheep it is a disgrace on him all the father has given me will come and none's lost all that comes to me all right the shepherd can't afford to lose a sheep that's the reason you backslider tonight is hanging around your heart trying to draw you back to the fold because he once kissed you and and you kissed him and told him that you loved him and raised your hands and praised him and you backslid and went out there and got all butchered up and wounded up in your spirit but he still holds around you all the time come on back wandering sheep I just can't afford to let you be lost maybe the little sheep that he had to go way out on the mountain to find all through the place maybe you're that sheep tonight laying out there wounded or somewhere but the shepherd can't afford to lose one sheep oh to follow the footsteps of the shepherd that's it don't be tempted tossed about worried Ted here down here today you got the Victory and tomorrow you're out of the victory follow the shepherd he's a leading so my sheep know my voice he said and the stranger said they get accustomed to hearing I said well if another Shepherd would come in and give that little holy lady call and he gives there would them sheep if they were out in the field come said oh no one more time one know those sheep know the very sound that every tone of that Shepherd's voice I thought well this is a land of the Bible now no matter another Shepherd going to stand up and try to impersonate that damn sheep would just keep on Grazy [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] but just let that little certain Bo speak every sheep would head up here the right up come marching look at them look at them [Applause] [Music] that's amazing isn't that amazing they coming oh my God oh my God oh my God I can't believe this oh my God thist oh my God this is amazing one more oh my some glorious day that king shepherd

prayer just thanking him for how much he loved me and how much he loved me when I was unlovable and how much he loved me when I was unlovable in the last two or three days but the proof of his love is election I rest my soul on that and if he knows when a robin Falls from his nest and he Grieves when he sees it [Music] died if he kisses the rose with a Morning Mist I wonder how much more does he love you and I and if he cares for a lily in an open fa and caresses each pedal with do if he acknowledges the tree when the winds make it kn how much more does he love me and [Music] you if he take out the time to turn a desert from its dve and carve out a mighty River to the Sea just to give a little brim another place to swim I wonder how much more does he really love [Music] me and if he's made away for all all that has been I've been told and be it's [Music] true then he's preparing me a place I cannot comprehend that's how much he really loves me how much more than arra rose that he gives life in the spring tell he loved me less than the [Music] burn in his nest that never SES yet he SES on the Wind if he can speak a simple word and common angry wind peace be still and he can come rolling see then he can speak peace be still to the storms within th how much he really loves me he can speak peace be still to every storm within that's how [Applause] much my god really loves me [Music] [Applause] praise the Lord the love of God if every man was a scribe betray and every stalk of grass was a quill the oceans were full of ink and every one of us started writing from the day we were born until the day we died and we wrote how great how wonderful that he was would never be able to touch it with me and when we talk about love we're not just talking about got a new car new house all my bills are paid I got this I got that if we had none of that stuff it's the love that he's given to us as Harry said his proof of Love is election that's right that we were chosen in him I'm glad for that aren't you praise the Lord before we um open to reading the scripture today we have a baby dedication they'll just come and and bring the little baby brother Alex and sister Esther

my brother and sister standing here to bring back to you this wonderful little gift that you've given to them my heart is about to burst this morning to see what you have done for them and how you've blessed them and Lord and given them this little Ezekiel James to be able to tutor him rais him teaching in your way Lord I pray that you just strengthen them and help them father I pray for my brother that you'd help him that he can be the right kind of Dad in the home that he can be able to be an influence upon his little son I pray for my sister which are Prophet is declared to be the Fifth Gospel may you help her Lord there's nothing quite like a mother's love if it's a true love Lord Jesus we bring this little life to you today I pray you'd keep him from the evils of the days sicknesses diseases we dedicate his little life to you today Father for a life of service in the name of the Lord Jesus amen how are you all happy for you stand together is there anybody here today that is his happy as I am that we got to have church I love going to church I tell you when I saw that weather report and what they was given and I thought oh no oh Jesus please but I I still believe myself that the Lord can move those things up and move them down you know I know the devil is the Prince of the power of the air but my God is King over the prince so the Deacon Brothers will keep an eye on the weather outside so if we need to cut it short I will but we're just so grateful to be able to come today second Peter chap 1 ver4 we're going to um look today on the right to be in divine order and you're talking about the love of God when weever we read what God has allowed us to be partakers of whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises 2 Peter 1:4 that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature the divine nature having escaped the correct ion that is in the world through lust so apparently Peter did not believe that they ate an apple in the Garden of Eden according to the way he looked at it you have escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity I may like to be remembered today as we pray I know we've for got so got a lot of fighting sicknesses flu this and that and the other so we want to be mindful of them today too just bow our heads together Lord Jesus it's such a great honor for us to be able to be together with your children that within itself is wonderful we miss each other when we can't get together I just think about it sitting back in the office a while ago I just wish I could pull them all up in my arms and just give them a big old hug and just let them know how much I love them and if I feel that way as a Shepherd a pastor how much more do you feel as our father you expressed how much you loved us by what you did to be able to bring us to this place today now father we're praying that you would help us as we Endeavor to open the Word of Life May the presence of God help us help me Jesus to speak only that which would please you Lord my motives my objectives Lord may they be pure help me father I ask for those that are sick and Afflicted Lord God that you'd be mindful full of them today some fighting the battle for their life but you're our God and you're a miracle worker we're beli in we commit the service in the word to you today in the name of Jesus and the saints of God said amen amen God bless you you may be seated let me read this to you again in in uh verse four whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that ye might be partakers of the divine nature the divine nature to be partakers of Grace it's wonderful isn't it that God would give you Grace unmerited favor something that you're not worthy of something you can never buy that's awesome to be a partaker of God's mercy that you do something wrong or many things wrong and instead of God giving you judgment and Justice God gives you mercy and says I pardon you of that to be a partaker of Divine Healing that you've got something in your body that going to take your life or it's going to change your life alter your life uh people pray for you you pray for yourself and the spirit of God moves for you and gives you a Divine Healing a miracle you partake of a miracle where something moves into your body a foreign evil spirit and begins to attack your cells or your membranes or your bones or whatever it is and through prayer the spirit of God moves and miraculously that force of evil leaves your body and it starts mending and going back to a well state but yet all of those things that I listed partakers of Grace partakers of mercy partakers of healing and of Miracles many people will partake of every one of those things and never partake of the divine nature now there's many many thousands probably be millions of people that have been healed by Divine Healing that will be lost there are people that have experienced the miraculous power of God that God has healed them absolutely make the doctors testify that they received a miracle from God and yet after they receive that Miracle they turn away from him him and go right back to the world Jesus healed many people that received Miracles Divine healings that was so profound that they were unexplainable but when it come right down to it where were all of those people that we read about in the four gospels when Jesus was crucified where were they then you understand what I'm saying so when we look about those things and we thank God for every one of those things I've experienced healings Miracles grace mercy I've experienced all that myself and I'm grateful for it but I am more grateful to be a partaker today of his divine nature that I ever have been one healing in my body because as I'm getting older I realize that I won't be able to fight things off the way I did when I was a younger man there will be things that will attack my body and things will start wearing out and things will have to be replaced or took out and then you try your best to live without them but if I am a partaker today of his divine nature I will never be the same again and neither will you now Peter is addressing this to those that are partakers of divine nature now we know that everybody is not of course but for those of us who are we ought to thank God for it it's more than going to church it's more than being a member of a church it's more than of feeding the the poor helping by the Widow some Cal and the cold winter time and all that's good works but yet what we believe that God did and his great expression of love was to make his own nature available to those of us who were born in such a vile state that it seemed as if though we were helpless and hopeless and yet God made a way that not only would we get Grace which is something that we're not worthy of and give Mercy something that he did not owe to us but after he did that part then he would give us a part of his own nature now as I was a little fell I couldn't really see that much about me that was like my daddy I couldn't see that much about me that was like my mama or aunts and uncles or cousins or things like that but as I started getting older then I begin to watch certain mannerisms that I would have and I watch you all I see some of the things that you do you don't even realize it because it's like it's in your DNA and there's certain ways that you'll you know do your hands a certain way or a certain way you'll wipe your mouth and you'll turn your finger like that I'll watch you and see how you do it and then I'll watch your daddy and watch him he does exactly the same thing that you do because there was something that was in you and you pick it up so it's not just the shape of your ears or your eyes or your nose but it's something that you inherited then there be other things that'll be like your mother other things that'll be like your grandfather my grandfather on my mother's side he was he was blind and I used to go up to their house and and stay with them and my grandmother wanted me to come up a lot my grandmother my really was a a Godly woman for what she knew and she gave me my first Bible whenever I got saved and said I hope I'm alive to hear you preach your first sermon out of it so I told her I said I I don't want to be no preacher I don't want nothing be no preacher she said yes you will so the Lord show her I'm not really sure or if that was a grandmother's wish but every time I look down at my hand like this it reminds me of my grandfather's hand my bone structure the way my thumb is the way my wrist turns around I remember seeing his hand and I would take his hand hand and it just kind of hold it and he was wrinkled you know and all of that but every time I do my hand like this I see my grandfather's hand so I am a partaker of the bone structure of my grandfather I've got a picture of my mother and father down in the basement where I listen to tapes and things down there and whenever I get ready to go upstairs I've got this picture sitting right up on a cabinet so I look at it every day sometimes multiple times during the day whenever I'm going there and I look at my mother and I look at my father and I can see as I get older that I'm taking on more of the image of my father you know when I read the word I want to be able to do the same thing don't you so some of you can probably look at images of of your father or your mother or maybe you've got an uncle maybe you've got a cousin whatever it is and you see things about yourself and others say you know what your daddy will never be dead as long as you're alive and you say wow wow that's that's really something well and there's nothing wrong with that but whenever you think of what God wanted to do for us and it's to me my way of looking at it's just my opinion of course which ain't worth very much but my way of looking at it God is able to do a greater work by changing our nature than he is by miraculously healing our body because a miracle can come by our body and just like that that thing is gone now if it's a tumor of course the demon will go out and then that mass will start putrifying and your body will start purifying it and it may make you sick but in a few days or a week or so whatever it is and that thing will be gone but when we're talking about what Peter mentioned here about adding to our faith virtue and knowledge and Temperance and all those wonderful things we know that is not a miracle but that is a process of the divine nature which God birthed in Us by the spoken word and then that starts growing and developing into the stature of a perfect man now that to me is the greatest miracle that we will ever have because a Divine Healing you know you may get healed today and 6 months from now you may die from the same thing and people say well they wasn't healed oh yes they could have been healed by the very saying and it come right back on them again but if you can ever walk into this place of a divine nature you will never as long as you ever live you'll never be a sinner again because that old man is dead am praise the Lord everybody so to be to be a partaker of the divine nature watch this in the unity of the one God in the Church the prophet said God sits on the throne of your heart in his control room controlling your emotions controlling your powers controlling your conceptions and making you one with him in fellowship and in love now listen what God wants to do God wants to control our emotions now that don't mean that he wants to control them and we never move or we never have any but he wants to control them in a way that are pleasing to him so it's okay for you to say Amen today it's okay for you to raise your hands and Worship the Lord so we want to control them let him control them in the way that brings him glory and God fills you with love he fills you with power he fills you with the spirit he fills you with his own divine nature and changes your carnal nature into his nature then in this you become a new creation in Christ Jesus now a man can come to the Lord and he's allw say he's a drunk a liar a hormonger whatever he might be and God miraculously begins to deal with him in the New Birth now it comes to the first stage of justification he's still hanging on to habits in his life it may take a month it may take six months or a year depending on how fast the man will grow he begins to let go of them things in life so he's coming into sanctification he lays aside smoking he lays aside habits he lays aside language that he used he lays aside books that he read that he should have never read so he's becoming washed and Sanctified then he goes on and he receives the true baptism of the Holy Ghost not a spirit immersed into the spirit of God but a soul regenerated by the Holy Ghost then once he comes out of that he starts being a partaker of divine nature then God starts the process of him coming into the full stature of a son or a daughter of God which will not be a miracle now remember the miracle is the new birth itself but the stature of a perfect man or woman is not going to come in Miracle form by that I mean it will not be a f minute transition and all of a sudden you'll be fully born oh you'll be full grown man a full grown woman you'll have all the faith virtue knowledge Temperance godliness brotherly kindness that you need in five minutes time and you'll be totally finished no it that's not the way that God planned it God planned it so that we would grow as an individual and we would grow together as a body and we would also grow together as a church age now you see whenever we think only of about ourself we are thinking so selfishly the things that you do today in this service can affect people around you it can affect your children do you parents understand that you are sending a message to your children when you come to church how they are to behave in church so if you sit there constantly looking at your watch sit there constantly checking your your phone to see if you got any new text or any new WhatsApp or any new Instagram posts and your children sitting there watching you you are teaching them that your phone and your your Droid or your iPhone is actually more important than going to church amen that's right we are teaching them now a man becomes converted and God Saves him we'll say God calls a man to be a preacher and the man God gives him a gift of faith and he starts praying for people everywhere people getting healed miracles signs wonders things happening and people think wow what a phenomenal guy what a great man that is well now watch depending on how his own stature is growing the greatest Miracle may not necessarily be the the blind that will see the lame that will walk but it will be him still maintaining that low esteem of himself in his own mind well come on now but if we're not careful we'll Overlook that man and we'll watch how that each Miracle begins to Puff him up a little bit more and a little more and he will look at himself as being a little bit more gifted than his brothers are and then the next thing that humility begins to go and before you know it he's taking 15 20 30 40 minutes out of the service to be able to tell he prayed for this one and he done that and he done that and he done that I took her the other day the Lord just dropped it in my heart and never even thought about it before but I told her I said you know the Lord Jesus if he would have so desired when he was here on the earth he could have told us so much about what he did in word form now he could have told us in every sermon that he preached I created the heavens and the Earth and I did this and I did that and I did this and I did that and I I created the Earth and I'm the one who put the granite and the core of the earth and I you imagine you imagine all that he could have told us and every sermon could have been how great he was and how wonderful that he was is that right he is is he not so you wonder why he didn't take all that time to tell us all the great things that he did when he he created the heavens and the Earth he could have told us exactly the number of angels that he made he could have told us exactly the number of angels that fail he could have told us all the hidden things that science still does not know about our universe and every sermon that the disciples and the people around him would have been mesmerized because he would have been saying truths nothing but the truth and told them how great he was and how wonderful he was but can you think of any passage in the New Testament where Jesus ever even mentioned from one place to another now I was over at capernium and I done this and this and this I was over at badia and I did that and that and that I was at best pegy and I've done this and this and this if it had not been for the four gospels being written afterwards we would have not known one miracle that he did why because that was not what he was there for he was there oh the great creation of the heavens and the Earth it was awesome but the message for the hour when the Lord Jesus was here was not just about what he had done but what he was now here doing and what he was doing was the Gospel that he was going to bring to change men I love to think about the creation of the heavens on the Earth but you know what I need help right here today with me I mean he needs help with you oh it's wonderful to think about the stars in the universe and I got to thinking about that and I thought Lord Jes Jesus you know and how is it that men will get up and take so much of their service and it's not they want everybody to know every time God tells them anything they got to get up and tell him now I'm going to share something with you this morning and uh you know that there's times that God has spoke some things to me and God has showed me things before and there's been a few times that I've got up and I've shared that with people and it's one of the most awful mistakes I've ever made because I would say I was praying the other day or the Lord told me this or told me that and as soon as it went out of my mouth I knew I had trespassed an element of intimacy that the Lord did not want me to share with anyone now you're talking about a miracle for us as the people of God that we will be able to maintain that humility of mind about oursel and not blabber everything that God does for us come on somebody oh but oh I'm giving praise to God praise to God sometimes I wonder who we're actually giving praise to cuz I really believe it this way that a true servant of God can be able to share Miracles Beyond his own Ministry and tell well the Lord is doing this in India and the Lord is doing that in Ohio and the Lord is doing this in Virginia and Louisiana you know I I just I just have to say it and be honest with you I constantly wonder about a man who's constantly talking about himself and not sharing what God is doing around the world especially since I've been hearing the prophet say it over and over and over again this week that brother when the lighter rain falls it will be around the world so our church is not the only church I just hope we're one of them the way I look at it I don't believe that brother Tim's church I don't believe that brother you know whoever the rest of our brothers are brother Samuel Browning I know how many brothers that I could mention I don't think they're the only church I think they want to just be part of the Church of what God is doing but do the Miracles actually ever stop but we place Miracles at only the healing of the body well what if God would be able to transform us from within our own nature now he does that by the Regeneration of the SE genene and the soul but the SE in the soul having been born by the Breath of God does not change every flaw and every fault about our human makeup so we still have things about us that are Gilbert things about us that are Oru things about us that are Reagan and Phillips and Ward come on somebody Swanson things that you inheritage you didn't even ask for them as a matter of fact if it' had been multiple choice most of us would have went down through there and would checked a lot of things off there ain't no way in the world I'd like to have a lot of the Reagan things I got and a lot of the sh things I got now the only only difference between me and you is I'm being honest and you're just sitting there all puffed up in yourself if you'd be honest you'd say the same thing because in reality you are your greatest enemy Now watch how the prophet again he goes on to say it's your individual or personal faith and trust in God to plunge beneath the blood and to be filled with his spirit and by becoming listen to this partakers of of not of the Divine the divine nature changing your own vile nature into a nature that loves God now watch this Focus this is the new birth now that is not a process that takes 40 years that is not a process that takes you know uh months and months and years that HS happens instantaneously but the stature that God wants his bride to grow into is not the miraculous which happens in a moment now notice he says that who believes every word that he said is the truth and accepting it as your own personal gift from God so where will our struggles be as Believers as we go on oh brother Donnie I've got the Holy Ghost but I I'm still struggling I went out and got drunk last night no I I don't want to I don't want to bust your balloon but you don't have the Holy Ghost if you went out and got drunk was not well I I committed adultery on my wife no God's Prophet said my comforter would keep me from doing that there's certain things a holy ghost filled child of God will not do if the Holy Ghost is only there for feeling what good does it do to us but it will annihilate the very desire of sin and the church said amen but will you make mistakes yes because you are a new creature in the same old Temple a new creation in this mess oh my goodness a new creation still left in this old pestil so it can age it can get sick it can get diseased and it can eventually die the body I'm talking about and yet you are a brand new work inside of you let's pick up again in second Peter chapter 1 verse 8 now after Peter mentions these things then he says for if these things be in you now notice the key if they be in you and a conjunction if they be in you that's phase one they be in you and abound now we don't just want them in us we want them to abound amen praise the Lord if they be in you and abound look at the word abound abundant make to increase to superabound of things to exist exist in abundance so when a person really gets the baptism of the Holy Ghost they get a portion of Faith a portion of virtue portion of knowledge portion of temperance brotherly kindness godliness all those things it's there in them in this we miniature form as we dedicated our our our brother and sister their little baby come up and we dedicate his potential of everything that he will ever be is in him only God knows if if time will go on for him to be a man to be able to be married every child that he would ever be able to father was in him a while ago when they brought him up here his temperament and they can already see things no doubt about him he's just like you Alex when he does that and he can say he's just like you Esther when he does that so you know and they're not teaching him no honey don't do that don't don't be like that it's something in him that's the way the new birth does us but as that child will grow so do we grow then God places this inside of our SE Gene and once it's born by the Breath of God he wants it to be able to abound and grow and keep on growing brother Donnie when will we stop we will never stop we'll continually to grow is that right now for if these things be in you phase one and abound phase two they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of Our Lord Jesus Christ now you realize that there are Christians that are Barren and unfruitful they are saved they go to church they love God but they have no fruit of a child of God there are people that sit around the message of the hour and they know the knowledge of the message and they love talking about it it really does something for them but they've never really been able to move into that to where that God's Great virtue of his nature remember what this is this is not my faith and my virtue and my knowledge or yours it's his it's his if we don't have this we're falling short of the glory of God and we are not bringing the True Glory that he wants us to have notice how verse n how Peter goes into this negative side of this and he said but he that liketh these things is blind so you mean a Christian can be blind a person that does not have this I find it amazing children how that Satan if he cannot stop us from believing God and believ in the message of the hour if he can stop us from being fruitful in this Avenue now I realize there's an element of people that think it don't matter if you've got love or don't have love there's people in the message that absolutely hate one another they have absolutely alt and their heart against one another and somehow they think they're full of the Holy Ghost and go in the Rapture I don't know where in the world you get that trash but that's exactly what it is you're not going in the Rapture if you hate one person there's only one person you can you can hate and be okay with it and that's the devil you cannot hate a human being I don't care what they've done to you it's just not allowed but he that liketh these things is blind and cannot see a far off naturally makes sense if you're blind you can't and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins now notice what these virtues do into the the molding of a child of God it not only helps you deal with one another but it also helps you to remember where you were before God got a hold to you why because if we're not careful as we go up higher and higher and H in these things and we yield oursel to the spirit of God as I mentioned a while ago about the supernatural that we can begin to think oh my oh my you know God healed this person and God done that and boy the Lord put this under my feet my feet it's easy for us to get this self-righteous attitude and we go to looking down on people come on somebody I don't know about you the Lord didn't give me the Holy Ghost just to keep it for myself when I go out and I meet people out I met a man the other day over at the Ford dealership and I was just talking a little bit he was doing something for me on my vehicle and I just started talking you retired he said no I'm not retired I said I'm a pastor oh as soon as I said pastor it changed I've known the man just casually for years and as soon as I told him that I was a pastor it changed all of a sudden we started talking about the Lord and just brought the presence of God right around both of us where we were now there's something about you know to me I want to be able to share something if I didn't tell the man about serpent seed I didn't tell the man hey you believe God sent a prophet but maybe the man had a need when I got home later in the day he text me again thanking me how he enjoyed talking you know to me our lord Jesus is not just good inside these four walls if our Holy Ghost our message only works inside these four walls it makes you wonder if we've got the right message Jesus said you are like a city that's set on a hill so let your light so shine that men might see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven is that right now watch this in the Statue of a perfect man the prophet said the church is now supposed to be taking the place of Christ carrying on his ministry so my Ministry is not mine I know we say well brother Donnie's Ministry brother Daryl's Ministry I understand where people are coming from when they say it but in reality if I'm a godall minister I've received a portion of Jesus ministry himself is that right so is every other God called man he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also yet a little while and the world seeth me no more yet you shall see me for I will be be with you even in you to the end of the world there it is carrying on his work so I'm not called to be a theologian I'm called to be a devil cter outer I'm called to be a preacher God's Prophet said the devil put sickness on the army of God or the people of God in the army of God takes it off I'm called to cast Devils out of you I'm called to lay hands on you praise the Lord I'm called to correct you because that is the ministry of Jesus Christ I'm not just called to baby you I'm not just called to preach you good things and make everybody feel good I'm actually called to break your legs every now and then that's right is that right that's what a Shepherd does but if a Shepherd does it he does it from the love of God he does it because he wants to help you and not hurt you now notice he said God dwells in the stature of a man reflecting himself into that being perfect worship you understand what why that though millions and millions of people have gathered around the Earth today and they have worshiped but I wonder how many of their worship has been received by God Jesus said in Mark how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men here is perfect worship God in the Statue of a man or woman wow so God in you Harry God in Me God in you brother Paul God and you sisters and brothers knows how to worship God now the church said well I know I know what God wants I know he wants us to Swoon in a certain way and he wants us to have lights flashing up here and fog machines now that sounds like a disco place to me not a house of God well come on Saints I'll tell you one thing you can see them sometimes on YouTube and see some of the stuff and some of the songs oh my goodness I saw video not long ago of some of the Christmas things that was going on in churches around the world I could not believe what they were doing how they were dancing how they were dressed Oh I thought what absolute complete utter nonsense and Abomination in the eyes of God come on now and yet they say though worshiping God that is not perfect worship we we've got a church that has a lot of talent in our church and I'm grateful for I'm grateful for our musicians and I'm grateful for the singers and and all of that but oh my let me say as your pastor we don't never want to just to depend upon our talent and our ability we always need the touch of the spirit of God don't we have some great singers and musicians aren't you grateful for it how I appreciate them putting forth the effort I'm glad they come over here and meet back there in the music room and they put all kinds of time into it because they want it to be as good as it can be but we never want to depend just upon our practice we never want to depend just upon our ability we always need that touch of the Holy Ghost amen now watch this so if we have the ministry of Jesus Christ himself what is that Ministry supposed to do let's read if you would in Ephesians 4:11 now remember he said God dwells in the Statue of a man and reflecting himself into that being perfect worship God in us being his Tabernacle now watch this Paul comes in Ephesians 4:11 and he says he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers now this is as we know and we call it and term it the five-fold ministry now we know that for a lot of folks in the message they don't believe in this anymore they believe that brother brandom fulfilled it there's a an element of people around the message who believed that brother brandham was the prophet and that brother brandham fit into Ephesians 4 and that he was called out of that Ephesians 4 and in one sense of the word I can agree with that another sense I cannot because if this Ephesians 4 was applicable only to the first church AIDS and the last Church AIDS then that would mean Hebrews 13:8 was not true to the other Church ages so God knew that there would be prophets that would come down to the church ages and they would stand under the inspiration of God and they would prophesy things agabus in the New Testament we don't even know if that brother was a preacher or not we have no record that the man ever preached any sermons but yet he did stand and prophesy Silas also a prophet a few others that the Bible mentions in the book of Acts but yet we believe that God is still the same today do we not you believe God still has this on the earth so he gave some Apostles some Pro phet some evangelists some pastors and teachers now notice what they're for they are not so these men can be lifted up and looked up to and people already make an idol out of them they are not sent upon the Earth so that people can have a form of idolatry but this is what they're given for for the perfecting of the Saints now this is not human sinlessness look at the meaning of the word it is complete Furnishing and equipping now you know we've had many preachers come to us here in the Years how we appreciate every man of God that stood behind this Pulpit or the other one at Happy Valley and every man's gift is different every man will bring it a little different way just like with brother Homer here Wednesday night then we enjoy that how the Lord used our brother and so appreciated him coming I've received so many comments about it and yet brother Homer is different than than any other preacher God knew that the message only needed one Homer Longoria God knew the message only needed one Donnie Reagan and some folks wish there wasn't even one God knew that we needed one Daryl Ward and and one sh Brown so God makes every one of them different and the way they study and their makeup and God will make something stick out to them and other brothers are set there there is no one man in the message no matter how great of a preacher that he is has all the understanding about election or about predestination or Grace or this or that or the other you know that's the truth right right so then God does that he diversifies his gifts so that each one will be able to contribute a little something that the other one could not this is why we need visiting ministers in our church brother timer is a great preacher one of the greatest preachers on my opinion that's probably ever been on the earth as far as a great preacher my stud's the word but brother Tim Needs visiting ministers in his church no matter how great the preacher is and how gifted that he is can you imagine brother brandham getting other ministers to come into his church brother brandham allowed brother Neville to preach and brother brandham said that he got many many sermons out of brother Neville's sermons oh my goodness so brother brandham also heard other preachers preach how can I overcome whenever he said that he heard a man mention about this somewhere and he got that note from that man brother brandom was like any other man when it come to that he did not believe even though he was the prophet messenger of the age he did not believe that he had the complete volume of the book there was only one person could say that and that was the Lord Jesus now notice so then the ministry is giving for the perfecting of the Saints which is the equipping of the Saints it's to bring the Saints to a state of completion and maturity now God knew this is going to take a long time let me tell you how long God has been working on the image of a perfect man in the church ages 2,000 years that's right hopefully it won't take us that long we'll all die before it ever happens right I think of it for 2,000 years he's been working on this image of a perfect man which is in the image of Christ now he said for the perfecting of the Saints for the work work of the min Ministry for the edifying of the preacher really so you mean a gift in a preacher's life is not to edify him I wish some of our brothers could understand that for the edifying of the body of Christ look at the word edifying the act of building building up metaphorically the act of one who promotes another's growth in Christian wisdom so now these men who are this this is what a God call man is called to do it's not that he's called to stand up and and try to get you to think how great he is and oh tell of all this and that and the other that happened to him and whenever you leave the service what you left was the majority was how great he was how many times God spoke to him brother Daryl told me a few years ago he's telling about a certain preacher and he said uh now I understand why God don't talk to me anym than he does he said cuz he's constantly hung up with that guy over there he has breakfast with him lunch with him supper with him that's why God ain't got no time to talk to me to hear some of these preachers talk about it I mean they're just about the second hand and command in heaven I don't believe that hogwash I don't care who they are there is no man on the earth that has that type a place in God come on somebody but why if if that would be so it would be somewhere here in the Bible it would be in the Bible that I'm going to have one man and that one man's going to be the great guy and everybody else is going to come at him I'll tell you what that is that's the spirit of organization that's around this message now this message will never make an organization but the prophet of God never said the spirit of organization wouldn't be around us and it is it's alive and well but I'm here to do damage to it today I may not be able to kill it but when I get done today I hope it crawls out of these doors amen he may have walked in but I don't want him to walk out y'all with me today now watch what a man then a godal man now you know any man that's called of God is going to share his own testimony he's going to share things God has done and if he's a real man he'll also share his mistakes uhhuh he'll share his shortcomings if it' been left up to the message followers would we have any of the human mistakes that brother brandham told us about would they have put that on the message oh no would they put that in the tapes they wouldn't have wanted it there and it's the same with some of our message guys on some of the preaching and some of the forecasting of this is going to happen and that's going to happen and this is going to take place and that's going to take place but you go back to the sermon where they preached it and all of a sudden it's taken off the tape oh and you say oh oh wonder why cuz it missed that's why so be honest leave it on there bear your shame and your reproach well come on if we venture without Authority we are worthy of Shame not honor my my my you see A God Called man is called to edify the body so the act of one who promotes another's growth in Christian wisdom piety happiness Holiness the thing built or an edifice so an edifice of course is a great Orthodoxy term which is used to describe a great Cathedral or a great building that's what God wants out of each of us not not some great cedal with magnificent spires and I've been into some of the different places of the world and some of them and they would just take your breath I've stood in churches around the world and they are just incredible and some of them built hundreds and hundreds of years ago but all of that will become dust and Ashes but here is the cathedral God is working on right here is the building that God is working on when he can do his work among the people with his power with his Supernatural and the more God used uses them the little they get instead of the more he uses them the bigger they get in their own eyes oh my now notice this Paul said so for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the Faith H I imagine the devil's down in hell just kind of Life at the scripture right here and they say are you kidding me do you saying there will ever be a Unity of faith on the earth I do if God cannot produce this scripture I don't care if he can fulfill every one of the rest of them in the Bible if he cannot fulfill this one I'll not serve him another day I'll walk away from this church and say I refuse to give God five more minutes of my time and you are to do the same but don't worry I plan on being back Wednesday night because if my God said it my God will do it now the problem of it is we look and think that we're all going to come together in some type of unity and Harmony of our human differences forget it that ain't what God's even talking about it's the unity of the face the unity of the Faith No Doubt Paul said things that Peter didn't understand he told us that he said they rest the scriptures he said and it's things that's hard to be understood so Paul said things that Peter didn't understand James didn't understand but they were in Unity on the facei of the Son of God we will always have our human differences come on somebody and people are looking at the message right now that we got a difference about this and a difference about that sure we do but we agree on a whole lot more than we disagree on I refuse to let the devil separate us at our church and try to get in our mind oh we're the only ones right that group up there they're the only ones right ain't none of us knows what seeds down in people's Soul just because somebody's believe in something in error today don't mean they'll believe in that in 6 months from now there may be us sitting right here today and we're holding on to something that is nothing but tradition some that's just as wrong as it can be but we don't know it yet the Lord may show us tomorrow and we'll repent of it come on now oh my to we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect not pluralized now not perfect men but a perfect man perfect tellos a full age brought to its end finished wait wanting nothing necessary to completeness and you're waiting for your Humanity to get perfect forget it your old stinking flesh will be with you 5 minutes before you're changed some of you may have to repent for a mistake you made or thought that you allowed too long to linger in your mind five minutes before the body Chang you're say Lord I Ain bre oh Lord have mercy in five minutes you're in a new body in another land why because this thing right here is going to bother you as long as you live but thank God it bothers you now notice but what will God do God will complete the perfect man which is not this it's this man in Here Wanting nothing necessary to complete this perfect that which is perfect consummate human integrity and virtue of men full grown adult of full age and mature oh my unto a perfect man unto the measure you understand God's pattern is is the measure so unto the measure that God held out you know what the measure was Jesus himself so whenever you start building something if you've got a plan and you've got a ratio and you got your CAD by which you're working on it all all that's well and good the computer do a lot of it but when it comes to a lot of it you have to kind of try it now when we got ready to design this platform and this Pulpit here we had some things in mind but there was some things that we had to alter as we went along some of the things around in the building we had to alter as we went along we didn't have you know exactly in our mind what we wanted but then then we made it so whenever brother John was going to make this pull pit he I gave him a picture that I'd found on the internet and he made up a type you know just a prototype and size and well how big do you want the batt how big do you want the columns and how many do you want so you take up and make a little image and he made just a little tiny thing and set it up here and I come over here and walked around and looked at it I looked at it here looked at it there looked at it over there because I'm thinking in my mind of proportion so do I want little tiny spindles which would work on your handrail in your home that would work fine in your home you know a little bit two by two guys two and a half by two and a half or something like that or do I I want something more beefy something a little bit bigger something a little bit wider something that the steps will be deeper and do I want a pull pit or it's about this big of a square and me said I need a lot of room I move around a lot so what do he do he done the same thing on that and you realize that God needed a prototype God hallelujah God needed a measuring tape so God emptied himself of his glory and emptied himself into humanity and become my measuring tape so you understand why I am not interested in making our church like an exact replica of other message churches no I have no desire to make our church an exact mirror of brother Tim's he has no desire to make his an exact mirror of ours I've been all over the world and I've seen how they worship and how they sing and they don't sing like us now you take the Spanish the Latino brothers and sisters I've been down in Mexico been in in South America and places like that brother Jack has been much more than I have and see how they get the rhythm of their music and how they sing totally different than us oh you go to Africa and to Kenya and to the places there oh my completely totally different God never made them the measuring tape God never made me the measuring tape by which all preachers are measured by God never made our church or any other Church the measuring tape by which all measure well I brother Donnie I visited this church and their worship is different from ours and and they're saying it why of course it is why because you all are a lot of what produces this our church has a personality that personality is made up by the people who come here and that personality will change and be redefined as certain ones come in and certain ones leave and the pastor of the church contributes a great element to that as well so I'm not interested in us being what what you want or like what somebody else want I want our church to be what pleases the Lord Jesus now to some folks we're awake too quiet we don't shout enough we don't run around and up hey I'm all for shouting as long as the shouter himself it's what's motivating us now if we have to do it by the music I don't want that because then I'm using a measuring tape of churches who have to have the music to pump them up I don't want that I've done been there and done that no I believe in Dancing Yeah buddy I want you to dance but when you get done dancing and jumping and shouting I want you to live just as high as you jump so if you jump that high live that high you jump that high live that high I hope I reason y'all don't jump but if we're not careful we'll turn this into a denomination then we judge Everybody by our church well our music is this way and our singing is this way and we only sing so many songs and right at 31 and a half minutes Brother Lou supposed to stop and we this and then you go somewhere else and they saying 40 minutes or 45 I can't believe they're off the word look at this time I cannot believe it oh friends what's God doing he's still working on the image of a perfect man how many needs help today for those of you that didn't raise your hands you need help worse than one the rest of us do unto the measure of the stature so the stature refers to to the growth of a man the stature to be attained to was Christ so God had this certain man small frame we not talking about the flesh now but a stature of a perfect man a man that God could use his mouth to create the worlds and he never uttered one word of it when he was on the ears he never sat around and said hey let me tell you all what I did there was nothing there and I created everything you see plus all that you do not see and i' done this and i' done that and man i' done this I mean he could have preached the whole three and a half years he was here preaching about what he did that's right you understand I firmly believe we ought to give testimony to the things that God is doing as long as it is about god notice he was the standard so he was the increment now most of you know that the United States is the largest nation in all the world that still uses inches and feet and miles and all that most of the rest of the Civilized world uh they go with the me system so on our bottles and on different things like that they've tried to convert a slow hardheaded Americans and they will uh do the two liter so they started you know there some of those your drink two liter and you say it and you've let go of the ounces so what are they trying to do slowly convert US so and our tools SAE we go by4 in 38 716 high 58 9 16 1116 3/4 so on and so on and so on but as as they're trying to convert US and bring us over to the other system of measurement and then the mechanics and our automobiles are built by 3 millimeter 5 mimet 6 7 8 1132 whatever more it is little by little trying to convert us so you see we were born lost in the system of humanity but God wants to convert us from our human system over to a system of divine nature now watch when he does this this is what ultimately he wants to bring us to so he was the standard by which God will do this now notice as Paul goes on to say in this unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ I will never Attain to the fullness of the godhead in my body nor will any of you I do believe the bride will attain to the fullness of the godhead in the mystical body to where the attribute of the fullness this is separate from the restoration of gifts under Pentecost separate from the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your spirit under Pentecost the attribute of the fullness of God has only been expressed in certain times down through the dispensation of man notice what Paul was saying the same as Peter use different terms but the word fullness is which is put in to fill up that which has been filled and then he uses this analogy a ship in as much as it is filled this is the choice of the meaning of the word that Paul used so it's like a ship in as much as it is fi or man with Sailors roarers soldiers in the New Testament the body of the Believers as that which is filled with Presence Power agency see Riches of God and of Christ now you see this is one why that denominational Clan Spirit wants to hang around us as if though our church is complete within itself and then we do not need other brothers we do not need other minister and that somehow we're Superior the way I look at it if this church is superior in some things I'd like to tell you what I think they're probably Superior in stupidity sometimes lack of surrender to God allowing your flesh to lead you amen uh oh well glory to God Preacher Brother Donnie not having enough love not feeling for one another in the right way thinking about ourselves more than we think about others now I think that we're probably Superior in some of them aspects oh ain't much to brag about is it so where are we it's evident friends I'm convinced especially in the last year and a half one reason that the bride is not any farther along than she is is because the ministry is not where they need to be they're debating over the size of the church and whose Doctrine is right and getting on YouTube and make making fools of themselves as the world sees us fighting each other if I remember it right the prophet said that the Brams fought in the backyard but we fight in the front yard on the front page in YouTube cuz it's like every preacher feels like he's called to resolve all the problems in the message the sooner we realize that is an absolute lie the more peace will have Among Us well come on somebody oh I think one of the other Superior things that we probably be failing in as a church body is that we don't pray for the preachers near enough we think they don't need our prayers oh yes they do they need your prayers that God will help them to fulfill Ephesians 411 that they can realize they are called to be able to bring the body to a state of maturity a state of completion a state to where God can use them in the short span of time that they are here to be able to help them to see what their goal is our goal is not to bring everybody up to what we think is the standard of the message well our church is the perfect Church well if you think that come and talk to me I'll let you know of a few things about us that a long way from being perfect you see the figure is obvious the Apostle Compares their condition then to a state of childhood and yet we're talking about the Ephesian Church which is one of the deeper churches in the message now Paul never had to write to the Ephesian church about the gift problem now the Corinthian Church was the church that had the gift problem so I wonder if some of the Ephesian folks would have said now what you know what actually Paul never wrote to us about that if we don't have an interpreter that we shouldn't speak in tongues in the church so I wonder since that book was addressed to the Corinthian Church if that even applies to us as Ephesian Believers since it had the Corinthian people's name on the book and then maybe the Believers at thessalonica said well you know what our church is Sovereign within itself and we didn't get no letter like that so you know what maybe them particular scriptures that Paul said about tongues and interpretation and so on maybe that just applies in the Corinthian Church and doesn't apply in thessalonica is it just me or is it hotter in a firecracker in here this morning woo what do you reckon them first century Believers did that they went through the letter to the Thessalonians and pulled out what they wanted and then they pulled out of the Corinthian letter what they wanted and then they said well you know what that's really to the Corinthian Church that really ain't to us uh because we're a sovereign body here and we we choose to to leave out all that about the women preaching and stuff like that cuz as a matter of fact that was directed to to Timothy 1 Timothy 2:12 and 1 Corinthians 14:34 that actually I mean there's nowhere written in the Thessalon Ian letter than anything about women preachers is even is even mentioned so probably it's not right for them in care rinse but it's okay for us here in thessalonica oh help us Jesus let's take out our White flags of surrender spiritually now and surrender to him I Surrender Lord I Surrender so you can live through me this is the way I feel today friends I guess it's because my hair is turning gray and I'm getting more wrinkles in my face but I've been asking the last year or so when are you going to retire my dentist asked me not long ago said have you retired are you close to the age of retirement I said no ma'am well I was just wondering you know you got a tooth Ser you need to have something taken care of you need to do this somebody else asked me you're fixing a retirement I said what what is it I'm just because I'm getting old them mean I'm retiring right brother Jack but this is the way I feel in my heart I have more of a desire in my heart to bring the purity of the word of God than I've ever had in my entire life it's like I'm more aware and more fearful of the place that a preacher stands in and how can influence people you fathers you know how you feel you got a son or a daughter or two or three in your home and you think how God's going to make you daddy's answer can you imagine multiplying that by hundreds of times and then by the scope of the Outreach of our church here thousands of times around the world I will stand before God that day and answer because I have influence tens of thousands of people how can a man not do that be terrified in his flesh I want to be more like him I want to preach more like him how many of you want to be more like he says that Christ had appointed the pastors and the teachers in the infant church that the church might be brought to a state of manhood now if the Lord Jesus wanted to use tapes then we are totally convinced he could have had tape recorders in his day and then never really been any need for any other preachers anyway cuz who could have preached the word better than the Lord Jesus so then all we need to have done would went around the world and say this is a voice of the master himself so we're going to play this oh he could have done that if he so we wish but he chose to bring the gospel through men that are full of faults and frail now when you turn on your TAP player if you still use those or your phone or whatever it is that you're listening to the message on can your phone feel your pain can that recording how wonderful and blessed that it is can it feel what you're going through Brother D can you talk to the tape player can you talk to your phone and say I I need something today for now I need something pick the right sermon for me pick the right sermon and then oh I I do it all the time I listen to tapes hours on in I'll amen praise the Lord thank you Lord Jesus I keep a notepad in every vehicle that I've got so I can write down things but I know I cannot talk to the tape I cannot talk to whatever means I'm using it so God chose men with some of the same faults and flaws that you do that you have and they will preach to you and then there'll be times that the preaching of the word won't exactly take care of every aspect in your life and you'll need to come back in their office and sit down and talk with them a little bit about this this and that and the other and you'll look across that desk and look into the eyes of a man that's a human like you are a man that will cry with you many of you know you've come and talked to me about Terrible Things sins and wrongdoings and you were ashamed even tell me I ask anyone to stand right now and say if I've ever treated you like you were a piece of wood or a piece of a medal and have no feeling towards you no but that's the way a tap player does the tap player can't cry with you the tap player cannot take its hand it has no hand I've sat in my office and hear things that people had to confess that was horrible never one time if I sit there without compassion and mercy this sometimes is the easier part standing here but God wanted men that these same things are going in them brother Donnie are you complete no but this is why you can come and talk to me because you're an incomplete Saint talking to an incomplete Pastor talking to an incomplete Joel Brown and an incomplete John Horn and Daryl Warden Pete Lawson and then jonath all the else of these brothers that are here only a man who feels he's above you will have that attitude and look down his nose on you what's about it oh Hallelujah Paul goes on to say that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine one of the deepest churches in the message as we'll say the Ephesian church and yet Paul still now they've been been around for years and years now by the time this is written but they were still not at the stature of a perfect man so Paul had to address them as children as children to the Corinthian Church he said Brethren be not children in understanding how be it in Malice be ye children but in understanding be men oh may God help us to check our grow of where we are are we children in understanding or men in understanding are we children in Malice or are we men in Malice it's amazing how he patterns our growth in where we are Brethren be not children in understanding how be it in Malice be your children but in understanding be men so I want you to look at yourself today as I look at myself and think how are we in faith are we men or are we children by saying men I'm not using the word to say that we're dominating of course by males but the whole human race is gathered there under that word so it's you sisters as well so are we grown up in faith but when it comes to hatred and envy and strife and jealousy we're children cuz we can get our feelings hurt today and we'll be playing together tomorrow CU that's what children can do they can fuss and fight and carry on but boy you jump on one of them my goodness one of mine and Harry's sisters I'll tell you what she's clawed my eyes out many a time I've still got some scars on my face that she put on there but if anybody picked on me they had her to deal with and she's took care of a few of them because I just never could fight I just wasn't the fighting type I just couldn't do it but now she'd fight me herself but she would not stand to let anybody pick on me look children we're always going to have differences we're going to have difference of opinion ideologies and doctrines but you know when it comes right down to it there there only one who knows who are children and who serpent SE I know we can get so disappointed in one another and failures of people and preachers and so on and so on but to me until God tells me there is no mercy for people I'm going to reach out to him I ain't going to compromise and there's a great balance in trying to find it there's only been a few people in my life that God has spoke to me and told me that his Mercy left them and from the way that it made me feel I don't mind if he ever tells me again because I still think about him to this day and think about what a horrific thing that it is so look at yourself today how are you in Malice how are you in jealousy and envy and strife and forgiveness and so on and so on are you like a child or are you a man the older get the more we learn how to choose our words and learn how to get even and plan and connive and all that oh my goodness anybody here besides me that just raise your hand before the Lord Lord I need help today don't give up on me Jesus don't give up on me Jesus Heavenly fathers we have our heads bowed to the dust of of the earth once again I want to say thank you for letting us have church today I'm so grateful we could come together Lord and dedicate a baby and sing and pray and your prayer request and then Lord we would hear a chastising sermon I I personally need them Lord I'm still dealing with this old rotten Humanity of mine so I still still need to be corrected father I thank you for the holy ghost that corrects us when we're wrong and Malice Lord Jesus let me be a child in jealousy Envy let me be a child I didn't realize Lord when I was a child how poor we actually were I just didn't think about it it was just just the way it was one Christmas if my aunt and uncle hadn't bought me and my sister something we wouldn't have got nothing but I never really thought that much about it I was just so happy to have a little something I didn't realize how poor we were until I started getting older and going to school and then I'd look and see how people were dressed and then they would laugh at me because some of my clothes had holes in them because it wasn't the style then and then through their cruelty I begin to realize that we were very very poor so Lord I'm afraid sometimes and more we become exposed to anger and jealousy and strife and so on the more mature we become in it instead of being like children that would just go on and laugh and I'm reminded of the story of gono Lord whenever they captured them and finally the band in the cheras they kept hid from them for a long long time because they couldn't find them and they used their Indian Scouts the Apache white man couldn't find them so some of their own Brothers the Apache Scouts they LED them to their Hiding Place once they capture them all then they take the guns away from the scouts stripped them of their whatever they gave them their clothes and so on and they put them on the same trains headed to Florida and it made the Apache Indians realize the white man had used him no wonder your Prophet said the white man is the Renegade and then some of the ones that had held out faithful was on that train with these guides and they begin to speak out against them and some of them had a little bit of a tussle back and forth but Geronimo spoke up and told them there's so few of us left we need to stand together help us Lord Jesus there's so few of us left keep us I pray father may we be men in understanding may we reflect the stature of a perfect man as we see that perfect man on the cross and the stature of a perfect man said father forgive them for they know not what they do may we not be children in forgiveness may we not be children and these great attributes of God we love you Jesus Can We Stand Together praise the Lord oh my Paul goes on in Ephesians 4:15 and he says but speaking the truths in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ so you're growing as an individual but we are growing as a church family but we're not the only one we're growing with the rest of the same message move around the world you see the people in Africa cannot go before we doing the Rapture even though they might be ahead of us the people in India they might be ahead of us there may be people in Europe they're ahead of us but once this Rapture is called everyone who goes in the Rapture will have have to be able to reach that stature of a perfect man and remember God is the one with the measuring tape so the best thing you and I can do is take our measuring tape and put it back in the hands of God because as long as you got that measuring tape you're constantly going to be measuring yourself you're going to be measuring you and you're going to be measuring those you go to church with you'll be measuring those around the message and I'm going and tell you before get done ain't nobody ever going to never ever match up as long as you're holding the tape but if you land the L the hand of Grace Hold the tape he will be able to exactly know where it fits and if there's anything liking he'll take care of it the last 15 minutes before you leave this world praise be to God aren't you glad He Didn't Throw the Clay Away can we just sing that together brother the weather's good can we worship a little bit all right I told the Deacon Brothers if it started snowing
