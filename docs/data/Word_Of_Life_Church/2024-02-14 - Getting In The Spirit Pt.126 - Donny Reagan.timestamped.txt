[35:00] brother Joe 7:00 remember that of course
[35:04] it be strain minute for those of you
[35:05] that aren't Young Folks anymore you can
[35:08] still stream it Matthew chapter 16 verse
[35:13] 18 and I say also unto thee that thou
[35:16] art Peter and Upon This Rock I will
[35:20] build my church and the Gates of
[35:24] Hell shall not Prevail against
[35:29] it Hebrews chap 2:
[35:33] 10 for it became
[35:37] him for
[35:39] whom are all things for it became him
[35:44] for
[35:45] whom are all things and by whom are all
[35:50] things so it's for him and by
[35:55] him
[35:57] in bringing many
[36:00] sons unto Glory now listen now this is
[36:05] before we were even
[36:08] saved and bringing many sons unto
[36:13] glory to make the captain of their
[36:18] salvation
[36:19] perfect through
[36:21] sufferings now this word perfect is the
[36:24] same word we've been looking at for
[36:26] perfect love
[36:27] it's not sinlessness but its
[36:30] completion so remember the Lord Jesus
[36:32] was totally
[36:34] sinless but his character he had condens
[36:38] send from the Eternal and took on a
[36:40] human character that still needed to be
[36:43] made perfect is that a that
[36:46] awesome so he's made perfect or complete
[36:50] teos complete lacking nothing through
[36:54] not through miracles signs wonders
[36:57] raising the dead Healing The Sick and
[36:59] all that was part of it but that's not
[37:01] the way our character is actually made
[37:04] but through sufferings
[37:07] plural and then Paul goes on to say for
[37:09] both he that
[37:12] sanctifies and they who are
[37:15] Sanctified are
[37:18] all of
[37:21] One how was that even
[37:23] possible he who Sanctified and they who
[37:27] are Sanctified are all of one for which
[37:34] cause he is not ashamed listen
[37:38] this to call them
[37:43] Brethren wow he is not
[37:46] ashamed to call them
[37:49] Brethren now I've just got to be honest
[37:52] with you
[37:52] tonight there's some members of my
[37:55] family
[37:57] I'm not sure I'd want y'all to
[37:59] know no s her look at me like y'all are
[38:02] kin to Angels there's some of yours you
[38:04] probably wouldn't want me to
[38:08] know how is this even
[38:13] possible that he is not ashamed to call
[38:16] us brothers and let's be
[38:19] realistic there's people that comes to
[38:21] our church maybe people that have come
[38:23] to our church in the past and things
[38:25] they have done the way they've
[38:28] lived my goodness we would be ashamed
[38:30] for anybody to know they come to our
[38:34] church but can you imagine him looking
[38:38] at us and all of our failures and
[38:41] shortcomings and it is not an
[38:43] embarrassment to call us
[38:48] Brothers his
[38:50] majesty and Glory are not
[38:54] compromised or given away
[38:57] by becoming
[38:59] Brotherhood with
[39:02] us his majesty his dignity his glory
[39:07] it's not compromised or given away by
[39:11] such a
[39:12] work notice what Paul goes on to say in
[39:14] verse 12 saying I will
[39:17] declare thy
[39:19] name unto my
[39:22] brethren Lord God
[39:24] children how can we not love him more
[39:27] than anything in this
[39:31] world so he's not ashamed of us and then
[39:34] it goes on to say I will declare thy
[39:36] name unto my brethren you realize what
[39:40] this is saying that we are of the same
[39:44] nature and the same origin and belong to
[39:48] the same family as the
[39:52] sinless Lord
[39:55] Jesus and then he says in the midst of
[39:59] the
[40:00] church will I sing praise unto thee now
[40:04] here this is Jesus Jesus is saying in
[40:07] the midst of the church I will sing
[40:11] praise unto thee of course your Bible
[40:15] readers know that this actually one of
[40:17] the fulfillments anyway happened in
[40:20] Matthew in the Book of Matthew whenever
[40:23] they was there at the communion table
[40:26] and Jesus began to expound to them a few
[40:28] things that was going to happen and then
[40:32] the Bible says they sang A Hymn Matthew
[40:37] 26:30 so the Lord Jesus fulfilled this
[40:41] scripture when he sang in the church and
[40:46] there wasn't but 11 of them there but
[40:48] they represented all of
[40:50] us so he
[40:52] sang in the
[40:54] church I believe he's still doing don't
[40:57] you and again I will put my trust in him
[41:03] and again behold
[41:06] I and the
[41:08] children which God has given
[41:12] me behold I and the children which God
[41:17] has given me for as much then as the
[41:22] children are partakers of flesh and
[41:25] blood
[41:26] now can this be scripturally
[41:29] correct that Paul is calling the family
[41:33] of God
[41:34] children even before they're
[41:39] saved this blows away a lot of our
[41:42] tradition don't it for as much then as
[41:46] the children are
[41:49] partakers of Flesh and
[41:52] Blood notice what he puts in the first
[41:55] order he doesn't put the Flesh and Blood
[41:58] first but the children
[42:01] part for the children are partakers of
[42:06] Flesh and
[42:07] Blood now notice what he does he also
[42:12] himself
[42:13] likewise took part of the same that
[42:17] through death he might destroy him that
[42:21] had the power of death that is the
[42:28] devil well we could say the benediction
[42:31] right now and go home and say it's been
[42:32] good to be in the house of the
[42:34] Lord and may life to be your rememory
[42:36] tonight as we pray God bless you I want
[42:40] to mention to you that Lance got to come
[42:42] home yesterday still not well but doing
[42:45] so much better I know i' uh appreciate
[42:48] your continued prayers I'm sure that
[42:50] there's many needs and requests among us
[42:52] tonight or they not let's just hold
[42:54] those in our hearts let's ask the Lord
[42:57] to open our hearts tonight to his
[43:00] word Lord Jesus we love you so
[43:04] much how could we not love
[43:08] you that you would
[43:10] so care for
[43:12] us that we had to come through flesh and
[43:16] blood and you
[43:18] said well if they will I
[43:23] will and yet before we were even
[43:26] born you were calling us
[43:30] brothers and
[43:32] children you were so confident in your
[43:35] own program you knew sin deaths sickness
[43:41] nothing would ever be able to stop you
[43:44] from accomplishing Your Divine
[43:48] Purpose that gives us Faith tonight Lord
[43:51] we ask that you would help us in this
[43:54] service help me to get out of out of the
[43:56] way
[43:57] father I'm your servant
[44:00] reporting for Duty I've studied I've
[44:03] prayed I've applied myself and I pray
[44:06] that you would come and help me Jesus
[44:09] help me to get out of the way be mindful
[44:12] of the needs of your children tonight we
[44:14] commit the service to you I bind every
[44:18] devil that would try to hinder this
[44:20] service Satan in the name of Jesus you
[44:24] are already defeated it you might as
[44:27] well just pack up your little Dy bag and
[44:30] go on back down to hell cuz we done come
[44:32] to have church tonight and you ain't
[44:35] going to stop
[44:36] us bless us now together father we pray
[44:40] in the name of Jesus and the children of
[44:43] God
[44:45] said I believe the children of God can
[44:48] say it better than that and the children
[44:50] of God said amen Ah that's more like it
[44:55] God bless you
[44:56] you can be
[45:04] seated I
[45:08] wonder for those of us here tonight many
[45:11] of us have been save for
[45:14] decades been walking with
[45:17] God giving
[45:19] him everything that we knew to give to
[45:22] him oh sure we've made mistakes and
[45:25] failures and
[45:26] when we would do that we would repent
[45:28] and make it
[45:30] right we've read our Bibles we've
[45:33] listened to tapes we've come to church
[45:35] we've prayed we've sang we've done many
[45:40] many things for him and for his children
[45:43] for his
[45:44] kingdom but when I read such things as
[45:48] we've just read here I
[45:51] wonder how many of us
[45:54] still
[45:56] lack understanding and what he has done
[46:00] and accomplished for
[46:02] us that he
[46:05] himself would not be ashamed to be
[46:08] identified with us and not be ashamed
[46:12] even though he knew he would find us in
[46:15] the depths of
[46:17] sin he knew that even after he saved us
[46:20] we would mess up so many times over and
[46:24] over again and some of the things things
[46:26] we would do would be so
[46:29] dumb and we would walk right into traps
[46:32] and
[46:33] snares sometimes with our eyes wide open
[46:38] wide open just just as fast as we can go
[46:42] and him doing everything that he could
[46:44] do to stop us and we just go headlong
[46:48] into it and fall short of his
[46:51] glory and yet he knew that I wonder
[46:56] Without You raising your hands tonight
[46:58] if there's any people here that have
[47:01] made friends with people and maybe
[47:03] acquaintances and then it developed into
[47:06] a friendship later and then as it went
[47:09] on in time that person actually became a
[47:12] great hindrance to you and your family
[47:16] and you look back and wish I wish I
[47:19] would have never even met that person I
[47:22] wish I would have never enjoyed in a in
[47:26] a friendship to them I didn't realize it
[47:30] was going to be so painful I didn't know
[47:33] what they were going to do to me and
[47:36] then we think of that and have those
[47:39] regrets and yet the Lord Jesus knew
[47:43] every time I would fall short of his
[47:46] glory he knew every time I would
[47:49] complain about having to preach things I
[47:52] don't like to preach he knew I would
[47:56] complain whenever he puts upon my heart
[47:59] to deal with issues and I know when I do
[48:03] I want to catch it I know preachers are
[48:05] going to call my name I know they're
[48:07] going to blast me I know that and then I
[48:11] complain about it I feel sorry for
[48:15] myself and he looked at me before the
[48:17] foundation of the world and said I love
[48:21] you
[48:22] anyway he knew every time that you would
[48:24] go through a trial
[48:26] and he would
[48:27] withhold understanding from you he knew
[48:30] you would question him he knew there' be
[48:33] times that you would even say it out
[48:34] loud do you even love me still do you
[48:39] not know my needs have you forgotten
[48:41] where I live are you not mindful of my
[48:44] situation he knew every time you'd do
[48:47] that he knew every time that Moses would
[48:52] scream out to God he knew every time our
[48:54] Prophet would would do the things that
[48:56] he did Elijah would do what he did he
[48:59] knew what Jonah would do and yet he's
[49:02] still not ashamed to call us
[49:07] family
[49:09] family there's some things that members
[49:11] of my family have
[49:13] done that's been a great pain to
[49:17] me whether on my mother's side or My
[49:19] Father's Side some of the way my family
[49:24] have turned out
[49:27] has brought me
[49:29] humiliation and they probably feel the
[49:31] same way about
[49:33] me not because that I've lived wrong but
[49:35] for what I've stood for because it's
[49:38] brought them shame even though they
[49:40] don't live
[49:41] here but yet the Lord Jesus so looked at
[49:45] us with all of that through years of our
[49:48] life and our unbelief and our fears and
[49:51] our anxieties all that we would go
[49:54] through and said
[49:56] I am not ashamed to call them my
[50:01] family as a matter fact I understand
[50:04] when I put
[50:07] attributes into
[50:09] flesh there's something about that flesh
[50:14] that W weakens the
[50:16] strength of that attribute to the soul
[50:21] and when I embody that attribute with
[50:24] all of its godliness and all of its
[50:27] Purity and when I embed that in human
[50:32] flesh there's something about it it no
[50:35] longer has the same power that it had
[50:39] when it was in my
[50:41] sinking it's like it dilutes it it
[50:44] Waters it down it takes away from the
[50:48] glory and the Splendor of what it had in
[50:52] my
[50:54] mind so he said how can that be what
[50:57] does it
[50:59] do so he
[51:01] said what if the children are partakers
[51:05] of
[51:07] Flesh I will
[51:09] become their older
[51:12] brother as it
[51:15] were and I myself will step from the
[51:19] fullness of the godhead
[51:23] bodily and I will weaken
[51:26] who I am I will lower my
[51:30] demeanor I will step in that same
[51:34] thing that they St i w understand how
[51:38] could Moses get so
[51:41] angry how could David when I gave him a
[51:43] kingdom and I gave him his enemies I
[51:46] gave him wives and children how could
[51:49] David step away from my
[51:52] commandment and commit adultery
[51:56] how could Solomon to whom I gave the
[51:59] outpouring of such wisdom that there had
[52:01] never been a man like him on the earth
[52:04] and allow him to build my house for my
[52:06] name and yet when he got old he turned
[52:09] his heart away from me what does that
[52:12] flesh
[52:13] do how does it so blind
[52:17] them to my
[52:21] love I want to understand
[52:27] so he
[52:30] himself become a
[52:33] man then he begins to From the Inside
[52:38] Out begin to feel
[52:41] fear
[52:43] trauma
[52:46] anxiety
[52:49] temptation as a matter of fact the
[52:51] prophet tells us that he was
[52:52] tempted by women right
[52:56] with
[52:57] drinking tempted in every Point like as
[53:00] we are even prayed to dodge the
[53:05] cross I'm so glad that prayer was not
[53:09] answered aren't you if it be thy will
[53:12] let this cup pass from me and then he
[53:16] even asked the question my God my God
[53:18] why has Thou forsaken me he didn't just
[53:22] say why he felt why and experienced why
[53:28] how many's ever experienced why it's one
[53:31] thing to say it it's another thing when
[53:33] you experience
[53:35] it and then he would turn it
[53:39] around that through the weakness of this
[53:42] same thing that Satan got every one of
[53:45] his kids whether it was Jeremiah Ezekiel
[53:50] naam Jonah oadi Zachariah Malachi every
[53:54] one of them dealt with their human
[53:57] flesh and he said that's the
[54:01] answer that's what I'll do I'll come
[54:05] through that weakness of
[54:09] humanity and pull the arrows of death
[54:13] into my own
[54:16] body I will reach out and grab them and
[54:20] slam them into my own
[54:24] chest and my heart will burst
[54:28] open and I will annihilate
[54:32] death in human
[54:35] flesh and I will destroy him that has
[54:40] the
[54:41] power of
[54:43] death that is the devil now he didn't do
[54:48] that in a
[54:49] theophany he didn't pull the spears of
[54:51] death and anxiety and worry and fear and
[54:55] bore our sorrows and our sickness he
[54:58] could not bear that in a theophany but
[55:01] he had to Bear it in human
[55:03] flesh and then he said I will take that
[55:06] Veil and in the weakness of that Veil I
[55:11] will conquer death hell and the
[55:16] grave every bit of
[55:19] it in the very same channel that Satan
[55:24] has defeated my people since the fall of
[55:27] Man In the Garden of
[55:32] Eden when you look at what he
[55:35] did and then realize what he has
[55:39] elevated us from and still left
[55:43] us in the
[55:45] weakness of this
[55:48] mortality anybody feel the same way I do
[55:50] there ain't nobody in the world I love
[55:52] any better than
[55:54] Donnie he is my favorite person don't
[55:57] sit there and look at me like a bunch of
[55:59] Holy Angels y'all are as rotten and
[56:02] stink and low down and no good I'm
[56:04] talking about your body just like I am
[56:06] and everybody else is and there ain't
[56:08] nobody you love no better and there
[56:11] ain't nobody that causes you more
[56:13] problem than your own sorry self the
[56:16] reason every one of us here tonight
[56:18] aren't any closer to God you might blame
[56:20] your wife you might blame your husband
[56:22] but the truth of it is it's you it's you
[56:25] can anybody say Amen it's ourselves
[56:28] that's our greatest enemy if brother
[56:30] brandham would tell us William brandham
[56:32] was his greatest enemy not blindness not
[56:36] diabetes not not you know all these
[56:38] types of demons that he dealt with but
[56:40] he said his greatest enemy was himself
[56:44] how many can say the same for you it's
[56:46] you that's your greatest enemy and yet
[56:50] God in saving us and giving us his own
[56:53] life he would still choose to leave us
[56:56] in this veil of weakness and humanity
[57:00] and from this pivotal point of where he
[57:03] changes us from the soul out he will
[57:06] start conquering again the kingdom of
[57:09] Hell in Bride form then what he's going
[57:13] to do is he's going to put the
[57:15] government of his body this mystical
[57:19] body on the earth inside this new thing
[57:23] that he's called the the church now this
[57:26] is a new word of course Church Upon This
[57:29] Rock I will build my church and remember
[57:31] it's a Brotherhood and it's not that you
[57:34] and I that that we're part of some other
[57:37] tribe and part of some other family and
[57:40] we were adopted in from some other
[57:42] family no we were attributes in the mind
[57:45] of God just like he was as a matter of
[57:48] fact we come from the same Source just
[57:51] at different times that's all and you're
[57:55] more like him than what your flesh would
[57:58] ever want you to realize the main
[58:00] difference between you and him was that
[58:04] he knew he existed before the foundation
[58:07] of the world as a matter of fact he
[58:09] existed in the logos form which was the
[58:12] pre-incarnate form of humanity because
[58:16] God never had a permanent body before
[58:19] the Lord Jesus but he existed so it was
[58:22] by him and through him that all things
[58:25] were made and remember God so loved the
[58:28] world that he gave his only begotten son
[58:30] but remember God is not a man God is not
[58:33] a man God is a spirit so God himself
[58:37] gave birth to a further extension of his
[58:40] own being unlike you and I we cannot do
[58:44] that and we think well Father and Son
[58:46] Well you think of an older man and a
[58:48] younger man that's not the way father
[58:50] and son is and the godhead father is
[58:53] that great Holy Light it is that which
[58:57] will overshadow our Joseph the Lord
[59:01] Jesus in the eth day it is that which is
[59:05] invisible and he chose to take on a
[59:08] human form I love the way the prophet
[59:11] says in in future home he thought of
[59:13] himself as being a
[59:16] human and that transmitted him down to
[59:21] become Jesus so he thought himself as
[59:26] being a human then the thought
[59:29] transmitted down to the Earth and landed
[59:32] in the womb of Mary and that then became
[59:36] his own body then with that body he
[59:40] would conquer and be able to come back
[59:43] in the form of the Holy Ghost and set up
[59:46] his government on the earth for 2,000
[59:49] years his body his shoulders has been
[59:53] the means by which he has spread forth
[59:57] the gospel it has been his means of
[1:00:01] establishing the Kingdom on the earth
[1:00:05] now you may look at I said boy I tell
[1:00:06] you one thing brother Donnie it hasn't
[1:00:08] been very successful oh but I beg to
[1:00:11] differ with you it has been so
[1:00:13] successful hell has fought it in every
[1:00:15] age and still to this day has never
[1:00:18] defeated it now it's got down surely
[1:00:20] it's went down the times of the Dark
[1:00:22] Ages it's been up and down through
[1:00:24] different times and trials but Satan no
[1:00:27] matter how hard he's tried he's never
[1:00:29] been able to defeat the Church of the
[1:00:31] Living God and let me go ahead and tell
[1:00:33] you in case you don't know it he never
[1:00:35] will because Jesus said Upon This Rock I
[1:00:40] will build my church notice this in the
[1:00:44] spoken words original see again we read
[1:00:46] this we looked at it several times but
[1:00:48] the prophet said his shoulders is his
[1:00:51] body where the government on the earth
[1:00:54] where's the government on the earth act
[1:00:56] in his body Saints shall judge the Earth
[1:00:59] is that right Paul said I dare you to go
[1:01:01] to court with one another and not take
[1:01:03] it before the church Saints shall judge
[1:01:06] the Earth where's the government going
[1:01:08] to be upon his
[1:01:10] shoulders his body the government upon
[1:01:13] his shoulders and that's a part of the
[1:01:15] body what is it his Earthly strengths
[1:01:19] now remember he he has no other
[1:01:22] strengths upon the Earth Angels even
[1:01:26] though they are ascending and descending
[1:01:28] and they are ministering to the hirs of
[1:01:31] Salvation yet angels will never stand In
[1:01:34] a Pulpit take an iPad or a Bible stand
[1:01:37] up and take a text and preach because
[1:01:40] the seed does not pass through Angelic
[1:01:44] ministration the seed passes through his
[1:01:48] body and that is you Angels could do a
[1:01:52] much greater job in the sense of course
[1:01:54] because they're without fault and
[1:01:56] without blame but he never gave the
[1:01:59] Angels the ability to reproduce himself
[1:02:03] he gave that to the weakest of his
[1:02:06] creation on the Earth's human beings but
[1:02:10] yet he designated that through the
[1:02:13] government of the church on the earth
[1:02:16] his kingdom would be propagated his
[1:02:19] kingdom would be ruled his kingdom would
[1:02:22] have a Dominion now I know you may look
[1:02:24] at it now and say oh my goodness I can't
[1:02:27] hardly believe that God will do
[1:02:28] something like this you mean this is
[1:02:30] great as it is you're looking at it on
[1:02:32] this side of the veil you wait till we
[1:02:34] get on the other side and see how they
[1:02:37] look at it it will take your breaths
[1:02:40] away now what's this the government upon
[1:02:42] his shoulders that's a part of it what
[1:02:44] is it his Earthly strength God's Earthly
[1:02:47] strength in his word is his word made
[1:02:52] flesh in his body body on the earth
[1:02:56] bringing it to pass oh but you say
[1:02:58] brother Donnie but we're SE in the
[1:03:00] minority it don't take that many to be
[1:03:03] able to fulfill God's promised word in
[1:03:05] every age and God doesn't do it the way
[1:03:08] that man does man looks at Grace masses
[1:03:11] of numbers and you know getting
[1:03:12] everybody together and doing all this
[1:03:15] God's never done it that way God has
[1:03:17] always worked in the minority and from
[1:03:20] that Minority he does more with that
[1:03:22] Minority than Satan does in his majority
[1:03:25] he's always done it that way so watch
[1:03:28] now as the prophet's talking about his
[1:03:30] meetings when he was in India now I
[1:03:33] stood there several years ago in one of
[1:03:35] those little churches where brother
[1:03:36] brandham was a very very small place and
[1:03:39] there was absolutely 10 thousands times
[1:03:41] thousands of people that was gathered
[1:03:43] down the streets and those meetings
[1:03:45] there and it must have been absolutely
[1:03:47] awesome great Miracles Supernatural
[1:03:49] things happened people give their heart
[1:03:51] to God people got saved but I want you
[1:03:53] to know notice now how the the prophet
[1:03:56] following in the structure of the
[1:03:59] apostolic form from the book of Acts and
[1:04:01] all down through the New Testament of
[1:04:03] how that he felt like a church should be
[1:04:06] carried on and a message now remember we
[1:04:09] believe that he came to restore our
[1:04:11] hearts back to the original faith is
[1:04:13] that right now watch he's talking about
[1:04:16] the meetings there in India what could I
[1:04:19] do there wasn't a thing perhaps maybe
[1:04:21] say there just to say there's a hundred,
[1:04:24] thousand of them now think a 100,000
[1:04:27] that had got saved say in those days in
[1:04:29] those meetings nothing I could do there
[1:04:32] was nobody to give to them the message
[1:04:36] that I believe there wasn't even a
[1:04:38] Pentecostal denomination that would
[1:04:40] cooperate with me all of those Souls
[1:04:43] probably
[1:04:44] drifted back into seeks chains Buddhism
[1:04:51] whatever more they come from no place
[1:04:55] to put
[1:04:57] them so you mean those hundreds of
[1:05:00] 100,000 Souls was his estimate that got
[1:05:04] saved and they went right back where
[1:05:07] they come from why there was no
[1:05:11] shoulders in India to carry on the
[1:05:16] work now wait a minute what about the
[1:05:18] spirit of God what wasn't angels in
[1:05:21] India of course they are well you know
[1:05:23] not when ever he was there in the early
[1:05:25] 50s they had already been making tapes
[1:05:28] since
[1:05:30] 1947 well wonder why that he did not set
[1:05:34] up home take
[1:05:37] churches so whenever he got back home
[1:05:40] that he would just start sending
[1:05:42] hundreds and hundreds of tapes over
[1:05:44] there in India and said well really
[1:05:46] y'all don't need a church you don't need
[1:05:47] a a pastor or deacons or nothing like
[1:05:50] that y'all can just stay home and listen
[1:05:54] to me preach and it'll be the same thing
[1:05:56] as going to church but apparently he
[1:05:59] didn't believe it that
[1:06:01] way well come on now don't get mad at me
[1:06:04] I know message people do and that's all
[1:06:06] they are they're message people they're
[1:06:07] not really bride because if they were
[1:06:09] bride they would do what Their Prophet T
[1:06:12] them to do if God's in your heart you
[1:06:15] can't wait till them doors are open and
[1:06:17] he said if you don't feel that way it's
[1:06:19] time you got to praying which lets me
[1:06:21] know a lot of message people need to go
[1:06:23] to pray
[1:06:24] now notice he said there was no place to
[1:06:27] put him that's a shame that's a disgrace
[1:06:31] because I had no cooperation because of
[1:06:34] the stand that I take now perhaps the
[1:06:37] Durban meeting now this of course is in
[1:06:40] South Africa perhaps the Durban meeting
[1:06:43] not having it rightly and the people see
[1:06:48] such a scattered amongst the Pentecostal
[1:06:50] faith and so forth the people didn't
[1:06:52] know what to do they had no place to go
[1:06:56] well why would you need a place to go if
[1:06:59] you receive Jesus and get everything you
[1:07:01] need and one of brother Ram's meetings
[1:07:04] why would you need a place to
[1:07:09] go hello why why would you need a place
[1:07:13] to go because you've got to assemble
[1:07:15] yourself together with where the
[1:07:18] government of God is being orchestrated
[1:07:22] in that Community where you
[1:07:25] live now watch this is what the prophet
[1:07:28] said and this is what he believed you
[1:07:29] haven't listened to this tape in a while
[1:07:31] or do you good to listen to it takeing
[1:07:33] sides of Jesus
[1:07:35] 1962 now the people didn't know what to
[1:07:37] do they had no place to go now again I
[1:07:40] ask you why didn't when he got home he
[1:07:43] just SED already while he was there he
[1:07:45] would have had time looking at all the
[1:07:46] response of the people and just have a
[1:07:49] bunch of those tapes air dropped have
[1:07:51] them aird dropped over there well
[1:07:53] brother Donnie had costs a lot of money
[1:07:55] well what's one Soul
[1:07:57] worth you mean one soul is not worth
[1:08:00] several hundred th000 or whatever more
[1:08:03] to send a bunch of tapes up and just set
[1:08:05] up home churches now we're going to do
[1:08:06] this because there's no preachers here
[1:08:08] yet and this will keep you all well
[1:08:10] that's what they're doing now come on
[1:08:12] friends I know you don't understand it
[1:08:15] but in Africa and India and different
[1:08:16] parts of the world there's preachers
[1:08:18] that are sitting down and quit preaching
[1:08:21] well I'll tell you one thing they should
[1:08:24] they should set out because if if they
[1:08:26] ain't called a bit more than that they
[1:08:28] don't deserve to be in the pull pit no
[1:08:30] way a god call man they ain't no devil
[1:08:33] they ain't no Bishop there ain't nobody
[1:08:35] else going to set him down because God
[1:08:37] called him and no man didn't call him
[1:08:41] praise the Lord now notice he goes on
[1:08:43] back to India again what if I was in
[1:08:45] India I'll go back to India and there
[1:08:47] I'd say to these people maybe they'd
[1:08:49] have thousands of them say there for a
[1:08:51] week or two and they'd see the ministry
[1:08:52] and they'd love it and they believe it's
[1:08:55] the truth and they'd come out of
[1:08:57] heathenism and maybe two or three weeks
[1:08:59] when I was over there there the nights
[1:09:01] and maybe a 100,000 converted to Christ
[1:09:05] nowhere to go again he comes back to
[1:09:09] nowhere to go and yet some people around
[1:09:13] the message look at that it's no big
[1:09:15] deal you know why they don't believe the
[1:09:17] message the way he
[1:09:20] did well praise the Lord Saints now this
[1:09:23] apparently was a big thing to him
[1:09:25] because he just keeps going back to it
[1:09:28] which is why I keep going back to it
[1:09:31] because I got the same holy ghost in me
[1:09:33] that he had in him and if you got it in
[1:09:35] you you'll say amen and you'll do the
[1:09:38] same thing that he said now watch the
[1:09:41] next day take a plane and start back to
[1:09:43] Rome then to the United States and leave
[1:09:45] them there like sheep Among Wolves what
[1:09:49] if oh no don't tell me he's going
[1:09:52] to what if I had a group of men young
[1:09:59] men trained in the message and say now
[1:10:04] wait a minute before I leave here we are
[1:10:09] going to set in order these
[1:10:15] churches now remember this is what Paul
[1:10:18] did on the aisle of Creet remember I
[1:10:20] told you to you not long ago over a 100
[1:10:23] cities from the north part of the island
[1:10:25] to the South but Paul got called away
[1:10:28] and he sends Titus back to set the
[1:10:31] churches in order and Paul told Titus
[1:10:35] when you go he was going under the
[1:10:37] apostolic umbrella of Paul and he said
[1:10:41] ordain Elders in every city now remember
[1:10:44] brother brandham was a word Prophet so
[1:10:48] what's he pointing us back to how the
[1:10:50] original church was founded and and also
[1:10:54] how they
[1:10:56] expanded now listen how they were
[1:10:58] founded and how they expanded now before
[1:11:02] I leave here we're going to set in order
[1:11:05] these churches I'll have a man who I've
[1:11:07] already telegrammed him they've got the
[1:11:09] money they're on the road right now to
[1:11:13] take over this a good man there's two or
[1:11:17] three young men with him who'll be his
[1:11:19] helpers and
[1:11:22] assistants
[1:11:24] well I I guess I don't
[1:11:27] understand I mean brother R didn't say
[1:11:29] there's three or four tape recorders
[1:11:30] coming and there's MP3 players coming
[1:11:33] and there's CD players coming and then
[1:11:36] we we got backup CD players and we got
[1:11:38] backup real are real
[1:11:41] players I mean I I I just can't hardly
[1:11:43] believe that brother brandom was wanting
[1:11:45] to put
[1:11:47] men
[1:11:50] men
[1:11:52] men didn't they know know they were full
[1:11:54] of mistakes he did just like he himself
[1:11:57] was that's right praise the Lord just
[1:12:01] like Paul was just like Peter was just
[1:12:03] like all of us are but that's God's
[1:12:07] choice that's right God has never called
[1:12:11] a tape player brother that's right and
[1:12:14] never will God has never said I will
[1:12:19] sing among the tapes but I will sing in
[1:12:24] the church among my
[1:12:26] brethren and somebody
[1:12:29] said now watch this is what the prophet
[1:12:32] now is giving to the people and the the
[1:12:35] brothers have come together ask him
[1:12:37] questions and about the state of the
[1:12:38] church at the Tabernacle that he's going
[1:12:40] to preach a little bit and he titles
[1:12:42] this taking size of Jesus but first he
[1:12:44] goes into the questions and here you're
[1:12:46] hearing from his heart something that he
[1:12:50] never said quite like this anywhere else
[1:12:53] but he's at home now now if you really
[1:12:56] want to get a lot of the doctrines of
[1:12:57] the message if you'll notice when he's
[1:12:59] at home it's when he really opens it up
[1:13:02] when he's out there among the goats of
[1:13:04] Pentecost and the goats of the
[1:13:05] denomination he'll water it down for him
[1:13:08] a little here and a little there but the
[1:13:10] real meat of it mm following back to
[1:13:13] where the Sheep pin was and if you'll
[1:13:15] notice when the Lord showed him the
[1:13:16] vision of the stored of food you'll
[1:13:19] notice it wasn't in Chicago it wasn't in
[1:13:21] Los Angeles but it was from that little
[1:13:24] Storehouse there on 8 and pin
[1:13:27] street now watch
[1:13:29] this and a church of this face can be
[1:13:35] set there with there will be an outpost
[1:13:37] in India an outpost in Germany an
[1:13:42] outpost in
[1:13:44] Switzerland oh if the Lord could let him
[1:13:46] look beyond the curtain of time
[1:13:49] tonight now when he was here he never
[1:13:52] got to see the this quote
[1:13:57] fulfilled he never got to see Outpost of
[1:14:01] the message all over the world do you
[1:14:03] realize brother Daryl which is not here
[1:14:05] tonight is not feeling well brother
[1:14:07] Daryl brother Jeff snod gra many
[1:14:10] ministers that's been able to travel
[1:14:12] International they have been able to see
[1:14:15] with their own eyes what God never
[1:14:18] allowed brother brandham to see with
[1:14:20] his he never got to preach in message
[1:14:24] churches in Switzerland and Luzon when
[1:14:26] he was there in
[1:14:28] 1955 he never got to preach in message
[1:14:31] churches in France the way I've been
[1:14:34] allowed to he was never allowed to go
[1:14:37] and preach in many of these countries
[1:14:39] that Servants of God have been allowed
[1:14:41] to go and never saw the message unveiled
[1:14:44] in that but still Harry he had the
[1:14:46] apostolic vision and burden well friend
[1:14:50] if we're really followers of this
[1:14:52] message I I believe we will get under
[1:14:54] the same anointing the same desire the
[1:14:58] same pulsation of the Holy Ghost that he
[1:15:01] was under and what was that pulsation to
[1:15:04] set up little outposts and let it go
[1:15:07] exactly the way the apostolic order was
[1:15:10] and have men that are called of God led
[1:15:13] by the spirit of God preaching the
[1:15:18] word and Word of Life Church said am a
[1:15:23] Church of this faith can be set in India
[1:15:25] there will be an outpost in India
[1:15:27] Outpost in Germany Outpost in
[1:15:29] Switzerland why right now we should have
[1:15:32] had them all around the Nations where
[1:15:34] I've been and the message then from
[1:15:38] there comes another and another and
[1:15:41] another you see what I mean now watch he
[1:15:45] he talks about Matson
[1:15:48] Bose and then this next paragraph but
[1:15:51] just watch what that man did did maton
[1:15:54] Boer
[1:15:56] trinitarian never did really see brother
[1:15:58] brandom as who he was or brother brandom
[1:16:01] benam but I love you I love you now
[1:16:03] Matson me and you's right here and you
[1:16:05] ain't going nowhere and he said I put my
[1:16:07] arms around him me and you's going to
[1:16:09] stay right here and we're oh but bam but
[1:16:11] bam I sure do love who I sure do love
[1:16:14] who butter
[1:16:16] bam but I want you to notice what he
[1:16:18] says about this man watch what that man
[1:16:21] did in his missions over there one man
[1:16:24] cuz he could send right back to Chicago
[1:16:26] and pick up Burton and all the rest of
[1:16:29] them and send them over there like that
[1:16:30] and start the work doing till they're
[1:16:32] getting up in the tens of thousands of
[1:16:35] one little Revival not a man with gifts
[1:16:39] just a man who had enough courage to go
[1:16:42] there and start what could have been
[1:16:45] done under
[1:16:48] this it would have been
[1:16:51] ranking in the Millions
[1:16:57] every time I read this I feel so sorry
[1:16:59] for
[1:17:00] him cuz Caroline never got to see
[1:17:03] it he never got to travel all over the
[1:17:07] world and think about praise God I'm
[1:17:09] holding a convention in Johannesburg and
[1:17:11] it'll be mainly message folks I'm going
[1:17:14] to Durban I've walked the streets in
[1:17:16] Durban where he was at I walked by the
[1:17:19] hotel where he stayed I've been in many
[1:17:22] of those places and realize that I am so
[1:17:26] privileged to preach to one message
[1:17:29] church after another after another and
[1:17:31] his heart's desire was to see it set up
[1:17:34] that way why he knew they could not
[1:17:37] survive and be what they were supposed
[1:17:40] to be by staying at home and just
[1:17:43] playing a tape I thank God for streaming
[1:17:47] I'm grateful for but look friend I've
[1:17:49] had to stream myself when I've been sick
[1:17:51] or Carol been sick and which stay home
[1:17:53] and stream and I'll tell you what I do
[1:17:55] every time I get done streaming either
[1:17:57] me or her one will say it thank God we
[1:18:00] don't have to stream all the time I'm
[1:18:03] grateful for streaming and I know
[1:18:04] there's people that are sick and people
[1:18:06] that don't have a church in their
[1:18:08] Community but I'm so grateful to God
[1:18:10] that I've got one where I live I'm so
[1:18:13] grateful to God that I can come to the
[1:18:16] house of God not just to be here not
[1:18:19] just to be in this building but to be
[1:18:21] with you and you and you and you and you
[1:18:24] as you bring your lick of fire and that
[1:18:27] presence gets greater and greater and
[1:18:29] greater oh how blessed we
[1:18:36] are can you imagine Brother
[1:18:39] renom last year when we had the
[1:18:41] dedication of this
[1:18:43] place and all them message people the
[1:18:46] majority of message people hundreds of
[1:18:49] them hundreds of them that were gathered
[1:18:52] here
[1:18:53] as I set up here on the platform and I
[1:18:55] looked out there and I couldn't keep
[1:18:56] from thinking brother brandham never got
[1:18:59] to preach in a message
[1:19:03] convention one of the last sermons that
[1:19:05] he ever preached things that are to be
[1:19:07] Rialto California an Assembly of God
[1:19:12] Church Assembly of
[1:19:15] God brother Harvey and sister Charley
[1:19:18] was at the place when he preached the
[1:19:21] Rapture brother Harvey told me before it
[1:19:23] was at a a meal there the banquet thing
[1:19:27] and they were in the back of the
[1:19:28] building trying to clean up the dishes
[1:19:31] right brother Harvey taking the
[1:19:33] tablecloth off the table brother Brandon
[1:19:36] up there preaching them was standing
[1:19:37] back there waving at him trying to get
[1:19:40] him to shut up he never even slowed down
[1:19:43] you'd never know that would you by
[1:19:45] listening to the Rapture next time you
[1:19:47] listen to it you can listen to it with a
[1:19:49] little better understanding and boy am I
[1:19:51] glad he never paid no no attention to
[1:19:53] them waivers because God knew there's
[1:19:55] going to be some down here waving glory
[1:19:57] to God thank God for the Rapture cuz
[1:20:00] there was sa he preached in there and
[1:20:02] never said nowhere else you imagine how
[1:20:04] distracting that M must have been for a
[1:20:07] preacher no deacons like we got in our
[1:20:10] assembly no assistant ministers there to
[1:20:12] pull with him but working in everywhere
[1:20:15] that he went them threatened to throw
[1:20:17] him out we're not supporting the meeting
[1:20:19] but he stood there by himself many times
[1:20:22] thank God God for a prophet who was able
[1:20:25] to Bray all the things that he did in
[1:20:28] order to bring you and I a rapturing
[1:20:31] message that would so build our faith in
[1:20:34] the gospel that one day it'll change our
[1:20:37] bodies aren't you glad he was a real man
[1:20:40] of God that stayed there and fought
[1:20:43] right through all
[1:20:45] hell oh
[1:20:50] my I just wonder what you'd say
[1:20:55] today if he knew all over the
[1:20:59] Earth his
[1:21:00] message I
[1:21:03] swept I've stood in homes in India and
[1:21:06] Africa and third world countries they
[1:21:09] didn't even have a floor
[1:21:12] dir we just
[1:21:15] recently put a concrete floor in a big
[1:21:19] church in Africa you did oh you didn't
[1:21:22] know it did
[1:21:24] and for years after we built the
[1:21:27] building they didn't have no
[1:21:30] floor well you imagine a bunch of holy
[1:21:32] rers getting in there shouting and
[1:21:33] dancing it was a dust storm every time

[1:21:54] have they're there to stay I mean until
[1:21:57] God moves oh my I saw them pictures not
[1:22:01] long ago and I thought my thank you Lord
[1:22:04] thank you and yet the prophet of God you
[1:22:06] imagine 44
[1:22:09] churches and one of the African nations
[1:22:11] still waiting for me to come and
[1:22:13] dedicate their buildings that you
[1:22:17] built that's only in one country oh if
[1:22:20] God would let him look beyond the
[1:22:22] curtain of time and look down into
[1:22:24] Malawi and look into Zimbabwe when there
[1:22:28] was a man that had found a half of a
[1:22:30] message book and a garbage can but at
[1:22:34] least he got the hi with the address in
[1:22:37] Jeffersonville and then a man ordered
[1:22:39] him and whenever he got he start handing
[1:22:41] it around and Revival broke out in some
[1:22:44] of the campuses there and some of the
[1:22:46] great preachers of that that country was
[1:22:48] men that was in in school and educated
[1:22:51] that man that did that later left the
[1:22:54] message can you imagine all he was was a
[1:22:57] carrier he was a carrier but out of
[1:23:00] there come one church and another and
[1:23:02] another and another and another it's
[1:23:05] gone around the world and little old
[1:23:08] places out in vutu where brother Ron
[1:23:10] Peterson has been many times a little
[1:23:12] tiny island in the South Pacific out in
[1:23:15] the middle of nowhere the most of you
[1:23:17] probably didn't even know existed and
[1:23:19] yet you know what they may not have any
[1:23:21] the great high class culture and this
[1:23:23] and that that we've got but there was a
[1:23:25] word of God went there the message of
[1:23:27] Malachi 4 up in Alaska where you also
[1:23:31] built another church all around the
[1:23:33] world where the word of God has went and
[1:23:36] people say what kind of strange people
[1:23:38] is it it's a word bride God placed his
[1:23:41] seed in the Inu God placed his seed in
[1:23:44] the Apache God placed his seed
[1:23:47] Hallelujah and all over the world and
[1:23:50] all skin colors and all color come on
[1:23:53] Church why God wanted his government

[1:29:50] words should be able to help if you say
[1:29:52] Amen God's
[1:29:57] system that was God's way back there
[1:30:01] that was God's way in the early church
[1:30:04] age and I believe it's God's
[1:30:11] way for us to do
[1:30:13] it oh
[1:30:15] my now let's read in Revelation chap 2:
[1:30:20] 2 I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy
[1:30:23] patience and how that's can bear them
[1:30:25] which are evil and thou Hast tried them
[1:30:29] which say they are Apostles and are not
[1:30:32] and has found them
[1:30:36] Liars wow you mean
[1:30:39] people were trying men who said they
[1:30:42] were Apostles now to be classified as an
[1:30:45] apostle in the time this was written in
[1:30:48] the Book of Revelation that was the
[1:30:50] highest class yes Apostles secondar
[1:30:54] prophets evangelist teachers and so on
[1:30:57] so the apostles oh my whenever you said
[1:31:00] Apostle you think Peter James John you
[1:31:02] know so there was a group of people in
[1:31:06] this church age and they were cling I'm
[1:31:07] an apostle I'm sent forth that's what
[1:31:11] the word means one that's sent forth
[1:31:13] with a message I'm sent
[1:31:17] forth but he said thou Hast tried them
[1:31:20] which say they are upon OST Les look at
[1:31:22] the word tried it means examine make
[1:31:26] trial of test for the purpose of
[1:31:31] ascertaining his
[1:31:34] quality now you understand that as leoty
[1:31:37] you have the
[1:31:39] right as the people of God to try every
[1:31:47] preacher you mean that brother darling I
[1:31:50] do
[1:31:52] me every other
[1:31:55] preacher you've got a right to look into
[1:31:57] the word you've got a right to listen to
[1:31:59] tapes you've got a
[1:32:04] right well you're going to put your soul
[1:32:06] in the care of them men you better
[1:32:10] try now the Lord is actually bragging on
[1:32:14] this church because this is what they
[1:32:17] done so he said thou has tried them
[1:32:20] which say they are our
[1:32:23] Apostles apostos messenger he that is
[1:32:26] sent a delegate one sent forth with
[1:32:29] orders so they were remain going about
[1:32:31] of course like it's always been you know
[1:32:33] we're sent of God hallelujah we've been
[1:32:35] sent of God to do this and
[1:32:37] that and God bragged on them and said
[1:32:39] you all have tried them that say they
[1:32:41] are Apostles and are not and has found
[1:32:45] them
[1:32:46] Liars
[1:32:49] whoa now what's this in the Ephesians in
[1:32:51] church Age The Prophet reads the
[1:32:54] scripture that we just read he said thou
[1:32:55] has tried them which say they are
[1:32:57] Apostles and are not and has found them
[1:32:59] liar see that apostasy had already begin
[1:33:01] to set in the first church in the first
[1:33:02] age already started right there because
[1:33:05] the elect and the true church who wanted
[1:33:07] to keep the precepts of the Bible and
[1:33:09] keep the words that Jesus said in his
[1:33:11] testimony that already began to pull
[1:33:15] away something be to happen there have
[1:33:17] been false teachers rise up people who
[1:33:21] were teaching wrong contrary to the
[1:33:23] scripture trying to bring in something
[1:33:26] or add something and that's the reason
[1:33:29] he gave this Revelation to the church
[1:33:31] and said whosoever takes away or adds to
[1:33:34] your part will be taken out of the book
[1:33:36] of life just don't meddle with God's
[1:33:41] word and the church said now watch this
[1:33:44] in the Ephesians Church age in the
[1:33:46] church age book again the same scripture
[1:33:48] thou has tried them to say they are
[1:33:50] Apostles and are not and has found them
[1:33:53] Liars my that is a blunt statement thou
[1:33:56] Hast tried them who call themselves
[1:33:58] Apostles isn't that
[1:34:00] presumptuous what right has a people to
[1:34:03] try those who call themselves Apostles
[1:34:06] and how do they try them oh I love this
[1:34:08] here it is Galatians 1:8 but though we
[1:34:11] are an angel from heaven preach any
[1:34:13] other the gospel unto you than which we
[1:34:16] have already preached unto you let him
[1:34:18] be a cursed it was the apostles who
[1:34:21] brought the original word to the people
[1:34:24] that original word could not change not
[1:34:27] even adopt or a dash of it Paul knew it
[1:34:32] was God who' spoken to him so he said
[1:34:35] even if I come back and try to give oh
[1:34:40] my listen this a second Revelation try
[1:34:43] to make one little change and what I
[1:34:46] gave originally let me be a
[1:34:50] cursed much less some bowlegged two
[1:34:53] before a preacher that ain't never even
[1:34:54] been in the presence of God long enough
[1:34:56] to get the Holy Ghost and he's going to
[1:34:58] stand up and say well I think this and I
[1:35:00] I don't care what they think I'm going
[1:35:03] to believe God's Bible and I'm going to
[1:35:05] believe God's Prophet over every
[1:35:07] preacher and the Baptist and the
[1:35:08] Methodist and the Church of God and
[1:35:10] every one of them in this message if
[1:35:12] they ain't saying what the prophet of
[1:35:14] God said come on
[1:35:17] somebody oh my notice so Paul knew God
[1:35:21] gave him that Revelation it was
[1:35:23] impossible for God to change it he said
[1:35:26] even if I try to make one little change
[1:35:28] in what I gave originally let me be a
[1:35:30] cursed Paul knew the first revelation
[1:35:32] was correct God can't give a first
[1:35:35] revelation then a second Revelation if
[1:35:38] he did it would be changing his mind he
[1:35:40] can give listen this beautiful he can
[1:35:42] give a revelation and then add to it
[1:35:48] amen amen he can add to it as he did in
[1:35:51] the Garden of Eden when he promised the
[1:35:53] seed to the woman then later designated
[1:35:56] that seed had to come through Abraham
[1:36:00] and then later said it would come by the
[1:36:02] same bloodline in David what's he doing
[1:36:04] giving more information on the same
[1:36:07] Revelation oh I'd make a good song more
[1:36:10] information on the same Revelation
[1:36:12] unfolding God's precious word more
[1:36:15] information on the same Revelation
[1:36:18] unfolding God's precious word he can't
[1:36:21] never change his mind he can't never
[1:36:24] change his word because he's God he
[1:36:27] cannot change he builds Revelation upon
[1:36:31] Revelation
[1:36:33] yeah well Glory notice he can give a
[1:36:37] revelation then add to it so what did he
[1:36:40] do he gave the Revelation then he said
[1:36:42] all right Abraham you're a part of it
[1:36:44] then he said David you're a part of it
[1:36:45] what's he doing adding more
[1:36:48] information but it was the same
[1:36:50] revelation
[1:36:51] listen this it only gave the people more
[1:36:58] information don't you understand friends
[1:37:01] why we need this
[1:37:04] message it gives us more
[1:37:08] Revelation but it gives us more
[1:37:11] information of the original Revelation
[1:37:15] that's written in our Holy Bible this
[1:37:17] message did not come to throw away your
[1:37:19] Bible I love my Bible now more than I've
[1:37:22] ever loved it in my life anybody that
[1:37:24] says I don't preach the Bible is a
[1:37:26] bald-faced liar and you come face me and
[1:37:28] I'll show you I do preach the Bible I
[1:37:31] preach it I quote it I live it I sleep
[1:37:33] it I eat it I listen to it I believe my
[1:37:36] Bible I love my Bible and this message
[1:37:40] only adds more Revelation to my
[1:37:43] Bible and more information it only gave
[1:37:47] the people more information to help them
[1:37:50] receive and understand it but God's word
[1:37:54] can't change the seed came exactly as
[1:37:56] revealed Hallelujah and see what those
[1:37:58] false prophets were doing they came with
[1:38:00] their own word those Ephesians knew that
[1:38:03] word as Paul had taught it and they were
[1:38:05] full of the Holy Ghost by laying on of
[1:38:07] Paul's hands and they looked those false
[1:38:11] prophets in the eye and said you are not
[1:38:16] saying what Paul said you are therefore
[1:38:20] false
[1:38:26] and let me just say it this way so it'll
[1:38:28] be easy
[1:38:30] understood any preacher I don't care how
[1:38:32] long he's been around or how many years
[1:38:34] he's preached if he stops saying what
[1:38:37] God's Prophet says and starts adding
[1:38:40] here and taking away there if need be I
[1:38:43] will do likewise you sir are a
[1:38:48] liar and I hope you have got enough guts
[1:38:51] that if I ever go nuts and lose my mind
[1:38:54] and I start saying things that ain't
[1:38:56] what he said that you all walk right up
[1:38:58] to me and say brother Donnie you're not
[1:39:00] saying what the prophet
[1:39:04] said well come on children we our souls
[1:39:07] at stake here we want to be right before
[1:39:10] God we're not following the men we're
[1:39:13] following the kingdom of God and the
[1:39:15] government is upon the shoulders of the
[1:39:17] body not just the
[1:39:20] preachers but on you as
[1:39:23] [Applause]
[1:39:24] well Oh my he said oh that sets my heart
[1:39:31] on fire get back to the word it's not
[1:39:35] you that really tries the Apostle and
[1:39:37] the prophet and
[1:39:39] teacher it's the
[1:39:42] word that tries
[1:39:45] him one of these days there's going to
[1:39:47] come a
[1:39:49] prophet to the lay of s Church Ag and
[1:39:52] you will know if he's a real one sent
[1:39:54] from God or not yes you
[1:39:56] will for if he is of God he will be in
[1:39:59] that word exactly as God gave it to Paul
[1:40:03] he won't deviate from that word come on
[1:40:06] now for a moment not for one I ow up in
[1:40:10] that last age when there will be many
[1:40:13] false prophets appearing notice one of
[1:40:15] the tactics always false prophets will
[1:40:19] use watch and see how they keep telling
[1:40:23] you that if you don't believe them and
[1:40:25] what they say you'll be
[1:40:27] lost
[1:40:29] yeah but when that last day Prophet
[1:40:32] comes on the scene if he is truly that
[1:40:34] prophet he will be crying out get back
[1:40:37] to the word or you are
[1:40:41] lost I can follow a man like
[1:40:45] them he won't build on a private
[1:40:48] Revelation or interpretation
[1:40:51] brother Randy Willis sent me a YouTube
[1:40:53] video the other day I showed it brother
[1:40:54] Rob showed it with some different ones
[1:40:56] and it's TL osbor standing explaining
[1:40:59] about when he went to Oregon and he said
[1:41:02] whenever he walked in there and he saw
[1:41:04] brother brandham there he said I saw
[1:41:06] Christ in that
[1:41:08] man he said I seen Jesus of course any
[1:41:12] he went on to say forget all that other
[1:41:14] foolishness that happened I'm talking
[1:41:16] about whenever I knew him I thought yeah
[1:41:18] what you're identifying as foolishness
[1:41:20] is what we call the opening of The Seven
[1:41:23] Seals when the full word is born into
[1:41:25] full manifestation but you imagine that
[1:41:28] man when he stands before God and
[1:41:30] whenever he stood there and said he saw
[1:41:32] Christ that brother brandham represented
[1:41:34] Christ oh some of these liars and
[1:41:37] hypocrites have left the message and
[1:41:39] they go around want to accuse a prophet
[1:41:41] of this and that and other you ought to
[1:41:42] go back to the testimony of those who
[1:41:44] were his contemporaries if they all
[1:41:47] looked at him as being a liar and the
[1:41:48] devil why do they all want his anointing
[1:41:51] if they looked at him as being a false
[1:41:52] prophet why didn't they make their
[1:41:54] videos and refute him it's easy after
[1:41:56] he's done come and gone for you bunch of
[1:41:58] yellow belly cowards to stand up I'd
[1:42:01] like to see you walk before him if that
[1:42:03] Prophet was on the earth you might walk
[1:42:05] before him but they'd pack you out come
[1:42:07] on somebody woo Hallelujah brother
[1:42:10] Donnie where you going with this I'll
[1:42:12] tell you where we're going with this
[1:42:13] we're going to leave this world with
[1:42:15] this we are taking our stand for Jesus
[1:42:19] Christ the word I don't know about you
[1:42:21] friend I'm more hungry for heaven than
[1:42:23] I've ever been in my life I've got more
[1:42:26] to go to heaven for than I had yesterday
[1:42:29] I'm sick of this world I'm sick of sin
[1:42:32] I'm sick of unbelief I'm sick of paty
[1:42:35] waste preachers let's get the light one
[1:42:37] in let's get full of the Holy Ghost
[1:42:39] let's get out of this place and go home
[1:42:42] let's leave this hell ho and let the
[1:42:44] devil have
[1:42:49] it
[1:42:57] good Lord what happened to y' was Pastor
[1:42:59] John the Baptist must have walked out
[1:43:00] here tonight didn't he man
[1:43:06] I already they were denying the word and
[1:43:09] setting up their own Creeds and
[1:43:10] philosophies instead of the
[1:43:14] word listen friends how dangerous this
[1:43:18] is denying the word setting up their own
[1:43:20] own Creeds and philosophies instead of
[1:43:22] the word
[1:43:24] that is
[1:43:31] Antichrist for Jesus is the word to be
[1:43:36] anti- is to be anti- Jesus to be anti-
[1:43:41] word is to be
[1:43:49] Antichrist but the tricky part about
[1:43:52] being Antichrist is they won't deny the
[1:43:55] cross they won't deny Heaven they won't
[1:43:57] deny hell they won't deny the power of
[1:43:59] the
[1:44:00] blood some of the Antichrist right
[1:44:02] around this message will preach the
[1:44:05] church ages they will preach 1909
[1:44:09] they'll preach the pillar of fire
[1:44:11] they'll preach part of it but they go to
[1:44:13] deviating here and changing it there so
[1:44:17] subtly and so
[1:44:19] slow
[1:44:21] hi this Lord
[1:44:25] Jesus because the spirit and the word
[1:44:27] are one and if you are anti word you'll
[1:44:29] have to be
[1:44:32] Antichrist and if it started in the
[1:44:34] first church it will have to grow until
[1:44:36] the end when it takes over and that is
[1:44:39] exactly oh my God help us what you'll
[1:44:42] see as we cover all the ages it starts
[1:44:45] out real
[1:44:46] small Satan never shows you what you're
[1:44:49] going to wind up being being but he
[1:44:52] starts you out so
[1:44:54] tiny remember Eve did not deny or
[1:44:57] question a whole
[1:44:59] book one
[1:45:02] word she didn't question a paragraph a
[1:45:06] sentence one
[1:45:09] word God help
[1:45:14] us the infallibility of the word is
[1:45:18] repudiated by the false
[1:45:21] Apostles of the false church now it is
[1:45:23] easy to get a wrong impression I'll
[1:45:25] close here momentarily of what we're
[1:45:27] talking about because I'm making this so
[1:45:29] strong it could sound to you as though
[1:45:32] this anti- word Antichrist spirit is a
[1:45:34] complete
[1:45:35] repudiation of the word a denial of the
[1:45:39] Bible culminating in its rejection no
[1:45:44] sir it is not
[1:45:46] that what it is is revelation 22819 then
[1:45:50] then you reach the scripture for I
[1:45:51] testify every man that Hearth the words
[1:45:53] of the prophecy of this book If any man
[1:45:55] shall add unto these things God shall
[1:45:58] add unto him the plagues that are
[1:45:59] written in this book If any man shall
[1:46:02] take away from the words of the prophecy
[1:46:04] God shall take away his part out of The
[1:46:07] Book of
[1:46:08] Life there will be preachers whose name
[1:46:11] was written in the book of
[1:46:15] life and they will stand up and preach
[1:46:17] trinitarian baptism there will be
[1:46:19] preachers that have preached this
[1:46:21] message and they'll stand up and say
[1:46:23] well I am an apostle of the message and
[1:46:26] I am sent to bring
[1:46:29] Clarity to what brother Bram
[1:46:32] said I'm sent to fill in the places he
[1:46:36] left
[1:46:39] out no you need to leave out from
[1:46:42] underneath that man that's
[1:46:46] right don't you understand friend
[1:46:48] there's going to be message preachers
[1:46:50] that it's going to miss the Rapture and
[1:46:51] they're going to stand before God and
[1:46:53] the Very message they refuse to
[1:46:56] preach they think they're going to stand
[1:46:58] with Paul get a hold of yourself Paul is
[1:47:01] not your
[1:47:04] messenger preachers in this message
[1:47:06] think they're going to stand by Paul
[1:47:08] you're not going to stand by
[1:47:12] Paul Elijah is your church a
[1:47:16] messenger and if you go against his
[1:47:19] teaching
[1:47:21] thinking you're standing with
[1:47:23] Paul you're not going to stand with Paul
[1:47:27] it will be that Prophet that will stand
[1:47:29] there and the other men of God who tried
[1:47:31] to warn you and you went right over the
[1:47:33] top of
[1:47:37] it God help
[1:47:43] us it is the changing of even one word
[1:47:47] by taking away or adding to it it is the
[1:47:50] original trick of Satan in the Garden of
[1:47:52] Eden he just added one little word to
[1:47:54] what God Said that did it it brought
[1:47:57] death and destruction and in Ephesus was
[1:48:01] just the same just a word added just a
[1:48:04] word taken away and the anti- word
[1:48:08] Antichrist Spirit
[1:48:11] began to
[1:48:13] flourish this one here in God of this
[1:48:16] evil age I shudder every time I've every
[1:48:19] time I listen to this
[1:48:21] I've listened to this this sermon many
[1:48:23] many
[1:48:24] times and it always just does something
[1:48:27] to me remember it was an
[1:48:32] unpardonable
[1:48:34] sin three times in the Bible for any
[1:48:39] persons to add one word of their own
[1:48:42] interpretation to God's
[1:48:44] word after it had been Vindicated the
[1:48:49] truth friends
[1:48:52] unpardonable unpardonable no
[1:48:55] forgiveness when we overstep the
[1:48:58] boundary of God's
[1:49:00] word and some of the worst ones that's
[1:49:02] guilty of it's
[1:49:03] preachers I wonder how many of them in
[1:49:07] our
[1:49:08] ranks have already crossed the
[1:49:13] line because they exalt their own
[1:49:16] ability and their own wisdom socalled
[1:49:20] and they think they know more about this
[1:49:22] and that and the other than a Vindicated
[1:49:24] prophet of
[1:49:27] God when we get that idea it shows how
[1:49:30] little we do
[1:49:35] know Lord
[1:49:38] God In the Garden of Eden one word added
[1:49:41] caused death when balam added the word
[1:49:45] that we all the same God never did
[1:49:47] forgive Israel every one of the than
[1:49:50] perished in the wilderness except the
[1:49:51] three that God brought out Jesus said
[1:49:54] there everyone dead that's
[1:49:56] Eternal separated they're all gone never
[1:50:00] was forgiven and he says it again it's
[1:50:04] an unpardonable
[1:50:07] sin never forgiven them and then watch
[1:50:12] how he directs this to us flee
[1:50:15] it
[1:50:17] Children of the evening light
[1:50:22] do you understand what that means it's
[1:50:25] going to be amongst
[1:50:27] us brother Larry it's going to come
[1:50:29] amongst
[1:50:32] us and this is our
[1:50:34] warning flee it brother
[1:50:37] Joel flee your
[1:50:41] children you will be Tried by
[1:50:48] this every one of us we'll be
[1:50:54] tried
[1:51:06] huh I don't know about
[1:51:09] you I want to take my
[1:51:12] stand on God's
[1:51:18] word
[1:51:24] let's about
[1:51:34] it merciful
[1:51:38] god Lord Jesus what a fearful
[1:51:43] time we know this has been in every age
[1:51:46] and the repetitive behavior of Satan
[1:51:50] he's like clockwork we can watch him he
[1:51:53] found something that worked in the
[1:51:54] Garden of
[1:51:55] Eden and he's used it ever
[1:51:59] since dear God I pray don't let there be
[1:52:02] a one of us sitting here tonight that
[1:52:04] have heard
[1:52:05] this Lord don't let us walk
[1:52:08] away hide me
[1:52:11] Jesus Keep Me
[1:52:14] Lord Keep Me Lord
[1:52:18] God no Lord if I live to March the
[1:52:24] 27th it will be 41
[1:52:27] years since I preached the first
[1:52:33] message about your
[1:52:35] Prophet 41 years ago in our little
[1:52:39] church in Kentucky March the
[1:52:42] 27th
[1:52:46] 1983
[1:52:48] Jesus I'm more fearful now than I was
[1:52:52] then how many have we seen come and go
[1:52:56] Lord how many preaches have we seen Fall
[1:52:59] by the
[1:53:00] wayside how many have we seen that built
[1:53:03] their own little agenda their own little
[1:53:06] deal or they never built it right
[1:53:09] off but they started letting go of this
[1:53:11] word and that word and another word and
[1:53:14] well you know what we we we just we
[1:53:16] don't accept the prophet's teaching on
[1:53:18] this and we don't accept AC it on that
[1:53:20] and we don't accept it on something else
[1:53:22] they never intend most of them to leave
[1:53:25] the message in its
[1:53:27] entirety they just start out with one
[1:53:29] little point and then
[1:53:32] another and then
[1:53:34] another and
[1:53:36] another Israel had no intention of ever
[1:53:39] becoming
[1:53:41] idolators they had no intention of ever
[1:53:44] offering their children in the arms of
[1:53:48] Kos
[1:53:51] this molten
[1:53:52] God that stood 9 to 10 foot tall Hollow
[1:53:57] on its
[1:53:59] inside and they would build a fire on
[1:54:01] the inside of it and heat up this
[1:54:06] image and take their children and lay
[1:54:09] them in the arms of this Burning molten
[1:54:13] image and their babies would scream and
[1:54:17] holler as the flesh would be cooked off
[1:54:19] their bodies and they would
[1:54:23] die in the arms of
[1:54:26] kibos they never intended to do that
[1:54:28] when they started committing
[1:54:30] idolatry but they just left off this and
[1:54:33] then a little more and then a little
[1:54:35] more and a little more they never
[1:54:38] started offering their children that way
[1:54:41] they never started falling down before
[1:54:43] the idols of Moab and
[1:54:46] Ammon but Satan knew that would be their
[1:54:48] end that's where he would take him to he
[1:54:51] does us the same way if we'll compromise
[1:54:54] a little here and well you know we we we
[1:54:56] just choose not to go this way well yeah
[1:54:59] we believe the message but we we just
[1:55:00] you know we're Sovereign and so we feel
[1:55:04] like we we don't have to do this in our
[1:55:07] church God I pray you'd help
[1:55:11] us help me Lord God as the pastor of
[1:55:14] this
[1:55:15] church I never get foolish and stupid
[1:55:18] and ignorant
[1:55:20] and arrogant and puffed up till I think
[1:55:24] I know more about your way than your
[1:55:28] Prophet
[1:55:29] does help the preachers around the world
[1:55:32] in this message
[1:55:35] God so no wonder we got one in the
[1:55:38] southern hemisphere preaching that he's
[1:55:43] Elohim and hundreds of his people bowing
[1:55:46] before
[1:55:48] him we've got others in the North
[1:55:51] Country preaching they're the Holy Ghost
[1:55:56] himself others preaching all kinds of
[1:56:00] nonsense they didn't start out that way
[1:56:03] but they started leaving this quote out
[1:56:05] and that one
[1:56:07] out that's how they got into this filth
[1:56:11] and Tommy rot just as much whoredom as
[1:56:15] any organization in the
[1:56:17] world how does Jesus hide me
[1:56:24] Lord please father if you ever
[1:56:27] see that I'd start to go astray take
[1:56:31] me cut my life
[1:56:34] short take me out if I get stubborn and
[1:56:37] hard-headed take me out God don't let me
[1:56:42] bring reproach on this
[1:56:45] word don't let me bring reproach on you
[1:56:47] Jesus don't let me lead your children
[1:56:49] astray please
[1:56:51] father help
[1:56:54] me May our church always be a
[1:56:57] beacon May our church always be a place
[1:56:59] where the sick can be healed the Lost
[1:57:02] can be
[1:57:04] saved the desperate can be delivered
[1:57:06] Lord
[1:57:08] God May our church always be a church
[1:57:10] that believes in the
[1:57:12] phenomena and the supernatural hand of
[1:57:15] God may we always be a church that
[1:57:17] believes in Holiness and purity
[1:57:20] and saying what the word says
[1:57:24] Lord please
[1:57:26] father
[1:57:29] please
[1:57:32] Hallelujah raise your heads if you
[1:57:36] would you can't see it
[1:57:39] tonight but I've got my banner hoisted
[1:57:44] up it's the banner of the blood of the
[1:57:46] Lord
[1:57:48] Jesus and I still believe it's what it
[1:57:50] takes to cleanse
[1:57:52] us on that Banner is also
[1:57:56] sanctification baptism of the Holy
[1:57:58] Ghost restoration of the word in the
[1:58:01] last days back to the original Apostolic
[1:58:04] Faith I believe in still
[1:58:07] preaching the doctrine that's in the New
[1:58:10] Testament I still believe in preaching
[1:58:12] the message too not just being a silent
[1:58:15] believer the Bible tells us there was
[1:58:18] Pharisees who who believed somebody
[1:58:20] would you please stand up and please
[1:58:22] explain to
[1:58:23] me how you could be a Pharisee and
[1:58:28] believe how could you still be a Baptist
[1:58:31] and believe how could you still be a
[1:58:33] Church of Christ and believe but we have
[1:58:35] them how could you be a
[1:58:38] Pentecostal and still believe because
[1:58:40] you
[1:58:41] hybridize like Eve did and your womb
[1:58:45] becomes spoiled with rotten defiled SE
[1:58:50] seed as long as I'm here as your pastor
[1:58:53] y'all can vote me out of course anytime
[1:58:55] you want to you can have an election
[1:58:57] after this service tonight if you
[1:58:59] wish but as long as I'm here as your
[1:59:01] pastor and I'm in your right mind I plan
[1:59:04] on preaching the new birth baptism of
[1:59:06] the Holy Ghost water baptism in the name
[1:59:09] of our Lord Jesus Christ the restoration
[1:59:12] of the end time the Mysteries that was
[1:59:14] lost down through the church ages I plan
[1:59:16] on keeping them I plan on still
[1:59:19] preaching the message of Malachi 4 and I
[1:59:22] plan on mentioning his name and I plan
[1:59:25] on reading quotes from the message of
[1:59:26] the hour I plan on still introducing to
[1:59:29] our young people they can have their own
[1:59:31] experience with
[1:59:34] God I still plan on praying for the sick
[1:59:37] and casting out
[1:59:39] Devils that's my banner and I want the
[1:59:42] devil to know because we moved in a new
[1:59:44] church I have no intention on
[1:59:47] compromising I'd rather have five in
[1:59:49] here than to have 5,000 if we could get
[1:59:52] that many in here and have a bunch of
[1:59:54] dead beats and ain't even born of the
[1:59:56] spirit of God I'd rather have five
[1:59:58] people that was full of the Holy Ghost
[2:00:00] and we'll turn this community upside
[2:00:02] down with five people filled with the
[2:00:05] spirit of God now I ask
[2:00:10] you I have made my stand on the banner
[2:00:13] that I fly
[2:00:15] high I ask you where do you stand

[2:00:56] dad about being baptized and it's really
[2:00:59] been pressing him so we want to baptize

[2:11:44] for him and you've been dealing with him
[2:11:46] I pray Heavenly Father that he would not
[2:11:49] stop here but it would keep on praying

[2:11:56] indwell him may you be with him Lord may
