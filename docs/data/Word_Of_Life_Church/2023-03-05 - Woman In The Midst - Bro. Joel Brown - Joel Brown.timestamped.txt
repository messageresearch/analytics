[49:42] that you can say it in a few matter of
[49:43] just a few hours or just a lifetime even
[49:46] to be to be quite Frank so so I I do
[49:50] have a lot and this has been bubbling in
[49:52] in my spirit for quite some time but but
[49:55] I'll try to hurry through because it's
[49:57] something that I think that will be very
[49:59] poignant and as I began to think on on
[50:02] this little thought I I thought about
[50:04] the days when I was younger and hearing
[50:06] those old fire and brimstone sermons and
[50:08] and just being reminded oh boy you
[50:11] better get it straight
[50:12] because hell is real
[50:15] We Believe heaven and we we know that
[50:17] the realities of heaven but hell is real
[50:19] the devil is real the devil is possible
[50:21] as well
[50:22] but I just was was captured in in those
[50:25] thoughts of um and thinking of this
[50:28] thing so
[50:29] if it gets a little tight
[50:31] the Bible says once you converted
[50:33] strengthen your brethren
[50:37] how many converted folks we have in the
[50:39] house
[50:40] all right I'm gonna be counting on you
[50:43] because we know there's three types of
[50:45] Believers that Gather in every service
[50:46] the believer the unbeliever and the
[50:48] make-believer
[50:51] I'm after the unbelievers I'm after the
[50:54] make-believers so you Believers you all
[50:56] help me and you how can I help you
[50:58] brother Joel strengthen your brother the
[51:00] Bible says you can say an amen because
[51:02] there may be somebody sitting on the
[51:04] chair beside that's going through hell
[51:06] that's going through something that's
[51:08] about to destroy them as a whole
[51:10] completely
[51:12] but when you saw him coming of course
[51:13] they had a smile on their face they said
[51:15] God bless you how are you doing I'm
[51:16] doing fine but
[51:18] so will y'all help me out today yeah the
[51:21] Sanctified folks helped me out today
[51:23] the saved folks will you help me out
[51:25] today
[51:26] let me hear an amen
[51:28] all right
[51:30] let's
[51:32] Saint John chapter 8 verse 9 and they
[51:36] which heard it
[51:39] being convicted by their own conscience
[51:42] because of guilty conscience needs no
[51:43] accuser we know this
[51:45] went out one by one beginning at the
[51:48] eldest even to the last and Jesus was
[51:50] left alone and the woman standing in the
[51:54] midst
[51:55] verse 10 when Jesus had lifted up
[51:57] himself and saw none but the woman he
[52:00] said unto her woman
[52:03] where are those thine accusers
[52:06] Half Men condemned thee
[52:10] let us in our heads Heavenly Father
[52:12] we thank you your word we know that your
[52:15] word is light
[52:16] your word is life your word is eternal
[52:20] so Lord you want to be captured by light
[52:23] today we want to be illuminated by life
[52:26] today we want to be reminded of
[52:29] something that's Eternal today
[52:31] because as we look around this whole
[52:33] crazy world in which we live Lord things
[52:35] are getting so dark so bleaks hopeless
[52:40] there's no source of of inspiration out
[52:42] there so Lord we have to attach
[52:44] ourselves to this word
[52:47] so may you come and do what you have
[52:49] already intended to do in this service
[52:52] through every vessel that you intended
[52:55] to use this day
[52:57] and may you magnify yourself through
[53:01] your people and it's in Jesus Christ's
[53:03] name we pray amen
[53:05] have your seats
[53:10] if we could
[53:12] just for for a moment for a while
[53:15] I just I really want to be conscious of
[53:17] my time because I don't want to go over
[53:18] I don't want to
[53:20] wear out your patients because I want to
[53:22] be invited back
[53:29] praise the Lord God is good
[53:32] this is broken by the way this is this
[53:34] is what I got from brother Donnie he
[53:35] mentioned and and when he was preaching
[53:38] about Rahab and I just keep it in my
[53:40] Bible just as a reminder keep it on
[53:42] display oh boy
[53:43] keep it on display so I'll just hang it
[53:46] right here I'll just keep it right here
[53:48] during the service so the two can be
[53:50] reminded amen you got to have that token
[53:52] on display you life evident
[53:55] amen even in your own home even when
[53:57] you're looking at yourself in the mirror
[53:58] nobody else is around but you you have
[54:00] to have it on display amen
[54:03] but I want to to draw today to the the
[54:07] simple thought of woman in the midst
[54:11] woman in the midst and it's a very
[54:14] striking scene this this scenario is
[54:17] always captivated me at times here
[54:20] lately for the past few months it's just
[54:22] been stirring really quite longer than
[54:24] that I should say just the the thought
[54:26] of it but
[54:28] we
[54:29] understand in looking at this woman and
[54:31] we're familiar with the story and we we
[54:33] know maybe if I have time and read some
[54:36] more of the scriptures on it as we go
[54:37] through this the service today but we we
[54:40] realize that this one was caught in a
[54:42] situation and she was being brought
[54:44] before some accusers and they were
[54:47] taking her to a man that they were
[54:48] trying to put him into position to be a
[54:51] judge over this situation and but the
[54:55] reality for her was is that her today
[54:58] had changed
[55:00] and her tomorrow was about to be oh so
[55:03] different
[55:05] everything about who she was was about
[55:08] to change everything that she had done
[55:12] everything that she had allowed herself
[55:13] to be captivated and inspired by was
[55:16] about to be changed forever
[55:18] and some of you no doubt are sitting
[55:20] here looking at me and listening to me
[55:22] today I'm here to tell you by the
[55:25] inspiration of God your tomorrow is
[55:28] about to be radically different
[55:31] because your today is about to change
[55:35] I promise you
[55:37] I promise you say I don't have any hope
[55:38] brother Joe I know I don't have any
[55:40] other on the source but your today is
[55:43] about to be changed
[55:46] because we have to realize that where
[55:49] we're going is a lot better than where
[55:51] we've been
[55:53] if brother Terry Horn was up here right
[55:55] now I can hear him say did you hear what
[55:57] I said
[56:01] because where you are going is a is a
[56:04] lot different it's better than where
[56:05] you've been I guarantee that
[56:11] her whole world was about to change
[56:13] Psalm 106 and once Praise You the Lord
[56:16] oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is
[56:18] good for his mercy endureth forever who
[56:22] can utter the mighty acts of the Lord
[56:23] who can show forth all his praise
[56:26] blessed are they the judgment and he
[56:29] that doeth righteousness at all times
[56:32] Remember Me O Lord with the favor that
[56:35] thou embarrassed unto thy people oh
[56:38] listen to this oh visit me with thy
[56:41] salvation
[56:43] salvation today is a visitor to you
[56:47] to me
[56:50] David says oh visit me with thy
[56:53] salvation Salvation becomes a guest
[56:59] nation is an opportunity for deliverance
[57:02] for victory
[57:05] for overcoming
[57:07] from welfare for prosperity
[57:10] it's going to be okay
[57:12] because salvation has come and made
[57:16] itself a visitor today for you
[57:18] it's gonna be okay
[57:20] Psalm 106 and 5 says that I may see the
[57:24] good of thy chosen that I may rejoice in
[57:27] the gladness of thy nation that I make
[57:29] Glory With Thine inheritance
[57:33] may see the good of thy chosen to give
[57:37] attention to to be able to see to to
[57:39] regard the chosen ones the choice ones
[57:42] that that Patron has given me the
[57:45] opportunity to see what it means to be
[57:48] chosen
[57:50] and also salvation has become this
[57:53] visitor to allow us to be able to
[57:55] rejoice in the gladness of thy Nation
[57:59] Rejoice means to to to to to worship to
[58:02] praise
[58:04] around God's people that I make Glory
[58:06] With Thine inheritance think about that
[58:09] that I make Glory With Thine inheritance
[58:11] salvation and opportunity that you who
[58:14] think that you aren't anything you that
[58:16] think that you can't you that think that
[58:18] that you're a nobody
[58:21] salvation Has Come Today to visit you to
[58:24] let you know that you can have the
[58:27] opportunity to Glory with the
[58:29] inheritance of God
[58:32] that word Glory means to shine
[58:35] to be bright to shine so you can have an
[58:39] opportunity to shine with the
[58:41] inheritance of God with God's portion
[58:43] with God's Property with good possession
[58:48] you are somebody
[58:51] because salvation has come to you
[58:55] you say you don't know my circle I don't
[58:57] need to know your circumstance
[59:00] I don't need to know what you've been
[59:01] through because where you're going is a
[59:04] lot better than where you've been
[59:05] just let all that go
[59:08] today is a new day for you
[59:11] you're listening out by way of the
[59:13] internet today is a new day for you
[59:17] I believe this
[59:19] that I may see the good of My Chosen the
[59:21] rejoice in the gladness of thy nation
[59:23] that I make Glory With Thine inheritance
[59:25] because in looking at this scripture in
[59:28] particular we can say it this way when I
[59:30] see it then what I saw will cause me to
[59:33] rejoice
[59:35] and my rejoicing will bring about
[59:37] changing me that I too will begin to
[59:40] shine
[59:42] because you have to see it before you
[59:45] see it
[59:46] so when you see it you can't see it
[59:52] so what I'm wanting you to do today is
[59:53] see it
[59:56] so you can see it
[59:59] when you see it
[1:00:02] I'm not confused
[1:00:06] open up your understanding
[1:00:08] verse 7 says our fathers understood not
[1:00:11] thy wonders in Egypt they remember not
[1:00:12] the multitude of thy mercies but
[1:00:14] provoked him at the sea even at the Red
[1:00:16] Sea nevertheless I love this word
[1:00:19] nevertheless in all of their forgetting
[1:00:22] and all their grumbling and all they're
[1:00:24] complaining
[1:00:25] nevertheless he saved them for his
[1:00:29] name's sake
[1:00:33] that he might make his mighty power to
[1:00:36] be known
[1:00:38] for the sake
[1:00:40] of or on account or because of his
[1:00:43] reputation
[1:00:46] because of his Fame because of his glory
[1:00:48] he did these things because of his name
[1:00:51] his reputation his glory that's why he's
[1:00:54] wanting to change radically your entire
[1:00:56] world today
[1:00:59] because all of heaven and all of
[1:01:02] eternity is backing what he says and
[1:01:03] what he's going to do why because his
[1:01:06] name is upon his people
[1:01:09] his people bear his identity who held
[1:01:12] the possession even the Devil Himself
[1:01:17] it doesn't matter who held the
[1:01:19] possession it had to go back to him free
[1:01:23] [Music]
[1:01:25] no matter what's binding you today you
[1:01:28] have a right to go back free
[1:01:33] nothing standing in the way
[1:01:36] listen he didn't have to pay a thing
[1:01:39] he didn't have to do a thing but just
[1:01:42] stop what he was doing
[1:01:48] did you hear that
[1:01:51] just stop what you're doing
[1:01:54] it's that simple
[1:01:57] click it off
[1:01:59] shut it down
[1:02:01] hello
[1:02:03] is that right
[1:02:05] my goodness
[1:02:07] is it really that simple
[1:02:10] it's really that simple
[1:02:12] just stop what he was doing and go back
[1:02:16] to his inheritance
[1:02:18] that inheritance hasn't left that
[1:02:20] Heritage is wherever you've left it it's
[1:02:22] still there it's still your possession
[1:02:24] free Oh my he had a right to it it was a
[1:02:27] god-given right because he by Grace had
[1:02:30] inherited and had been given to his
[1:02:32] fathers and handed down year after year
[1:02:35] no matter what had taken place
[1:02:39] if he lost it it must go free it meant
[1:02:42] Grace is is a way provided for every
[1:02:44] individual to return to the rightful
[1:02:46] inheritance
[1:02:48] Grace
[1:02:52] is the means through which we have that
[1:02:54] way back to our inheritance
[1:02:57] he's given it to us
[1:03:00] hmm
[1:03:03] being concerned about that you're you
[1:03:06] you you you you can't come
[1:03:09] you know and I've heard I'm gonna go and
[1:03:11] say this I've heard even comments just
[1:03:13] in in general talking about now that
[1:03:14] we're in a new church and and people are
[1:03:16] are seem to think that they can't no
[1:03:19] longer come here because it's new
[1:03:23] I leave that alone that's for my pastor
[1:03:26] but it's real nonetheless
[1:03:29] you have a right
[1:03:31] thinking that you're nothing Prophet
[1:03:33] says God who is rich in Mercy I'm only
[1:03:34] saying this not to mix up Doctrine but
[1:03:36] to straighten it out that we might get
[1:03:38] away from this fear and scare you don't
[1:03:40] know who you are
[1:03:44] I just told you about an inheritance
[1:03:46] some people don't even know what they
[1:03:48] possess
[1:03:49] some people don't even know what's in it
[1:03:51] already been given to them
[1:03:53] I'm here to let you know there is a way
[1:03:55] made there there is a portion of
[1:03:58] Eternity that's for you you have a place
[1:04:00] in the economy of God
[1:04:04] you don't know who you are you are not
[1:04:05] going to you're not going to be but now
[1:04:08] you are the sons of God
[1:04:11] it does not yet appear what we are who
[1:04:14] we shall be what we shall be but right
[1:04:16] now
[1:04:17] this day we're not going to be we
[1:04:20] already are because he's already made it
[1:04:23] so that we can be
[1:04:27] sometimes we need to shake off the
[1:04:30] weights
[1:04:31] and just get back in step
[1:04:33] and catch up with everybody else
[1:04:38] you say That's mighty arrogant brother
[1:04:40] Joel yes you better catch up because
[1:04:42] we're about to take we're about to leave
[1:04:43] here Saints
[1:04:46] it ain't time to lag behind it ain't
[1:04:48] time to let things weigh us down
[1:04:52] my
[1:04:54] woman
[1:04:56] in the midst
[1:04:58] your life that's in you the prophet says
[1:05:00] now your life that's in you now now
[1:05:03] somebody say now
[1:05:05] somebody say today
[1:05:07] at this moment
[1:05:08] the life that's in you now had to be
[1:05:11] with God before you were even become
[1:05:14] material here on Earth
[1:05:17] before there was anything but God you
[1:05:20] were one of his attributes
[1:05:23] hmm
[1:05:25] how in the world a woman in the midst of
[1:05:28] confusion of chaos of of of of of of of
[1:05:31] the railing work of words of the world
[1:05:34] she was still being called back to who
[1:05:36] she really was
[1:05:39] is that true woman in the midst now if
[1:05:43] what this woman had done was so bad
[1:05:45] according to the law listen
[1:05:47] if what she had done was so bad
[1:05:49] according to the law which they knew the
[1:05:52] the scribes and the Pharisees that they
[1:05:53] knew so well
[1:05:55] why didn't they take her to the
[1:05:57] courthouse or to the courtroom and bring
[1:05:59] conviction and render judgment there
[1:06:02] why didn't they do that
[1:06:04] huh these guys knew the law
[1:06:07] they were Experts of the law they were
[1:06:10] great expositors of the law of Moses
[1:06:16] they can tell you where he was what
[1:06:18] dated was what church he preached in
[1:06:21] what the title of the sermon was what
[1:06:23] paragraph what line
[1:06:26] and can't live a Victorious life at all
[1:06:30] they're just scribes and Pharisees
[1:06:34] message scribes message Pharisees
[1:06:38] Word of Life scribe oh yeah they're here
[1:06:43] Word of Life Pharisees
[1:06:46] hmm
[1:06:48] you gonna get yourself in trouble
[1:06:53] hmm
[1:06:55] I've been given away of Escape
[1:06:59] my but why didn't they do that
[1:07:03] they in all reality they did not care
[1:07:06] about this woman
[1:07:09] and and and and incidentally they
[1:07:11] probably didn't even really care about
[1:07:12] what she had done because they
[1:07:13] themselves have probably done some of
[1:07:15] those very same things right
[1:07:16] hello
[1:07:21] but it was an attempt to bring more
[1:07:23] shame it was an opportunity for them to
[1:07:26] have an audience
[1:07:28] hmm
[1:07:30] and you know there's there's something
[1:07:32] about having an audience that in
[1:07:34] boldings emboldens a person's purpose
[1:07:38] you get them by themselves and they
[1:07:39] won't be as bold but you get them in a
[1:07:41] little crowd
[1:07:42] huh
[1:07:44] where they can begin to make a name for
[1:07:45] themselves and you know but it's
[1:07:48] something about that atmosphere
[1:07:51] These Guys these scribes in these
[1:07:53] Pharisees the Pharisees in particular
[1:07:54] they they were crafty guys because you
[1:07:57] know they they held to the traditions of
[1:08:00] Moses of the fathers of of of of the
[1:08:03] Torah but they didn't so much hold on to
[1:08:06] the word you know what I mean
[1:08:08] they they they they held the traditions
[1:08:11] and and they would they would uh they
[1:08:12] would bring my Newt and and and
[1:08:14] vexatious uh uh uh extensions to the
[1:08:18] message of the hour
[1:08:23] they they bring extensions well let me
[1:08:26] tell you what he meant
[1:08:30] your Pharisee
[1:08:34] I don't care to hear what he meant I
[1:08:35] heard what he said
[1:08:39] and that's what I'm called to do is say
[1:08:42] what
[1:08:43] what and not say what said he meant
[1:08:47] so shut up Pharisee
[1:08:51] shut up scribe
[1:08:53] chatter chatter chatter chatter
[1:08:58] Ma
[1:09:02] so these two these two groups the
[1:09:04] Pharisees and the scribes though
[1:09:05] distinct in their expertise and what
[1:09:07] they did
[1:09:08] they had a United ambition
[1:09:12] they they they they had a United
[1:09:15] anointing even upon them
[1:09:18] and it was to scrutinize Jesus the
[1:09:22] manifested word of the hour
[1:09:25] to bring accusation against the message
[1:09:28] of the day
[1:09:31] hear me
[1:09:33] they wanted to entrap him in some way
[1:09:36] and these these folk with this anointing
[1:09:39] upon them they're always around to
[1:09:40] frustrate the purpose
[1:09:43] is that true
[1:09:44] they were always there to challenge
[1:09:46] truth and to bring up a question they
[1:09:49] were always there to challenge present
[1:09:52] day truth because the present day light
[1:09:54] was not in them they didn't fully
[1:09:56] understand it they couldn't understand
[1:09:58] it because it wasn't a part of who they
[1:10:00] were
[1:10:01] but yet they were religious
[1:10:05] and in that ambition to tear down and to
[1:10:08] destroy
[1:10:10] the manifested word there was a casualty
[1:10:13] of no concern to them
[1:10:16] you think about it all that's going on
[1:10:19] now around the the this this this is the
[1:10:22] message today there are a lot of
[1:10:23] casualties all because some Pharisee all
[1:10:27] because some scribe
[1:10:29] huh
[1:10:31] Shipwrecked lives
[1:10:34] let me tell you something brother you
[1:10:35] have something to answer for
[1:10:41] um who are you brother Joel
[1:10:44] brother Joel
[1:10:46] that's who I am
[1:10:50] better watch it brother Joel I am
[1:10:55] I'm watching me walk on my way out of
[1:10:57] here
[1:10:58] and I want to take as many as I can as I
[1:11:00] go
[1:11:01] I want to encourage as many as I can to
[1:11:03] shake yourself from these things
[1:11:05] I gotta hurry I got a lot to get to
[1:11:09] because knowing the law they were crying
[1:11:11] for judgment upon this sister because of
[1:11:14] her unlawful act they knew the law they
[1:11:17] knew every dot every Tittle they knew
[1:11:18] everything
[1:11:20] and here they were Earthly was blocking
[1:11:22] the way to the heavenly
[1:11:24] preventing someone from getting into
[1:11:27] heaven
[1:11:28] here she was being judged and condemned
[1:11:30] because of her past but the reality for
[1:11:33] her that day her judgment was standing
[1:11:36] right in front of her
[1:11:38] did you hear that
[1:11:40] today judgment is standing right before
[1:11:42] you not me but but the word
[1:11:45] judgment was standing right in front of
[1:11:48] her
[1:11:49] she was in the midst of her judgment
[1:11:54] greater than Solomon is here in 1961 but
[1:11:56] remember there wasn't a drop of rain
[1:11:58] fell to Noah got in the ark there was no
[1:12:01] fire fell at all till lot came out of
[1:12:02] solvent Jesus said it was it was in them
[1:12:04] days so it will be in the coming of the
[1:12:06] son of man the church it don't have to
[1:12:08] be judged
[1:12:11] it's already been judged for it judged
[1:12:14] Christ and Christ stood its judgment for
[1:12:16] the church when we are in him we are
[1:12:19] free from judgment and see what this
[1:12:21] sister did not realize is that she was
[1:12:24] in him
[1:12:27] because he comes to his own
[1:12:31] brother he's come to you today
[1:12:34] sister he's come to you today
[1:12:41] we are free from judgment if God judges
[1:12:43] you then he's unjust
[1:12:48] so if there are those outside of him who
[1:12:52] are bringing judgment upon you then
[1:12:54] they're being unjust
[1:12:57] they're uncredible
[1:13:00] they have no credibility
[1:13:02] they have no value they have no worth
[1:13:06] they have no ability they have no
[1:13:08] anointing they have no calling they have
[1:13:10] no place
[1:13:13] don't even give them the opportunity to
[1:13:15] land in your ear
[1:13:18] shut up you Pharisee
[1:13:24] that's impolite
[1:13:28] well sometimes you know I found out this
[1:13:29] I get in trouble with my wife so many
[1:13:31] times
[1:13:32] but sometimes being rude is the only
[1:13:34] thing some people will hear
[1:13:37] that's true you try to be nice
[1:13:40] you try to be diplomatic
[1:13:42] you're trying to be decent but the only
[1:13:44] thing that they will hear you just got
[1:13:46] to be down straight and just flat out
[1:13:49] and then they're going to have the
[1:13:50] audacity and nerve to get upset at you
[1:13:53] I've been trying to tell you but you
[1:13:55] won't listen
[1:13:59] my
[1:14:01] as we go on
[1:14:03] if God judges you then he's unjust
[1:14:04] Christ took our judgment for us
[1:14:08] praise the Lord
[1:14:10] and by one Spirit we're baptizing that
[1:14:12] body he that believeth on me has
[1:14:14] everlasting life and shall not come into
[1:14:15] judgment
[1:14:16] so today we find out that Society the
[1:14:20] the church world even they would rather
[1:14:22] have their theology
[1:14:25] they they they and instead of the the
[1:14:28] engrafted word the realities of the word
[1:14:30] the manifested word they would rather
[1:14:31] have their own theology they'd rather
[1:14:33] have their science they'd rather have
[1:14:35] their technology
[1:14:37] they would rather have their modern
[1:14:39] perspective
[1:14:41] is that right they would rather follow
[1:14:43] under the indoctrination of their boss
[1:14:46] of the company for which they work
[1:14:51] it's a powerful thing
[1:14:53] when you're in a powerful position in a
[1:14:55] powerful company you've got to march to
[1:14:56] their beat
[1:14:58] and not just when you're on the clock
[1:15:01] they watching you when you're off the
[1:15:03] clock
[1:15:04] they're hearing things you say when
[1:15:05] you're off the clock
[1:15:07] hmm
[1:15:12] but these things they'd rather have but
[1:15:15] for me in all of this modern things that
[1:15:17] are taking place today just give me
[1:15:19] Jesus
[1:15:20] just give me the Simplicity of this word
[1:15:23] manifested in this age because he took
[1:15:27] our judgment for us
[1:15:29] that we don't have to be bombarded and
[1:15:32] cower down to this Modern Age
[1:15:35] is that true
[1:15:37] we no longer have to wear the rags of
[1:15:39] sin we no longer have to to March to the
[1:15:42] beat of that drum we we have been given
[1:15:44] Royal attire
[1:15:47] we dress different
[1:15:50] huh
[1:15:51] I'm not talking about Justice we dress
[1:15:53] different we eat different things
[1:15:56] we're simply different
[1:15:58] we have to accept that fact that we are
[1:16:00] different now if you are trying to live
[1:16:03] a life that that says you should be
[1:16:04] different and you're cowering down to
[1:16:06] this Modern Age and you're living
[1:16:08] another way no no no no no no no no no
[1:16:09] that's not what I'm talking about you
[1:16:11] need to grab a hold of this word today
[1:16:13] and realize that you have been called
[1:16:15] you have been given at inheritance that
[1:16:17] will cause you to walk in that way of
[1:16:20] aristocracy
[1:16:24] I'm not talking about you anglophiles I
[1:16:25] ain't talking about all that's a British
[1:16:27] and the monarchy and all I'm talking
[1:16:28] about this Royal thing this Royal thing
[1:16:30] from eternity
[1:16:33] we've been given the Garb and everything
[1:16:35] to dress us properly this bride has made
[1:16:38] herself
[1:16:40] ready
[1:16:42] huh
[1:16:44] that's the Bible
[1:16:47] amen this scene Saint John 8 and 2.
[1:16:50] watch this
[1:16:52] Jesus consequently had just come from
[1:16:54] the Mount of Olives he'd been uh the day
[1:16:56] before ministering and doing everything
[1:16:58] that he was doing that day and he went
[1:16:59] to the Mount of Olives to pray and we
[1:17:00] find out that that was a place that he
[1:17:03] would go to a lot it's believed I
[1:17:04] believe I will not believe that in fact
[1:17:06] Mary and Martha's home was on I think
[1:17:08] the East Side of the Mountain The Garden
[1:17:10] of Gethsemane was on the west side but
[1:17:12] this was a place that he resorted to to
[1:17:14] get away from all of the all the
[1:17:15] nonsense and the craziness and early in
[1:17:18] the morning he came again into the
[1:17:19] temple and all the people came unto him
[1:17:21] and he sat down and taught them
[1:17:25] here we go
[1:17:27] and the scribes and Pharisees of Saint
[1:17:29] John 8 and 2 and the scribes and
[1:17:30] Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken
[1:17:33] in adultery and when they had set her in
[1:17:36] the midst
[1:17:39] that's what captivates my mind and my
[1:17:42] spirit so much with this story they set
[1:17:44] her in the midst in the middle of
[1:17:47] here this woman was in the middle
[1:17:51] here was her past
[1:17:53] and here was her future
[1:17:57] and something was about to happen that
[1:17:59] day that was going to change who she was
[1:18:02] where she had been what she had done
[1:18:05] and let her realize that this is who
[1:18:09] you've always been
[1:18:13] Lord
[1:18:14] she may have even had the stench of the
[1:18:16] ACT even upon her body
[1:18:22] come on now
[1:18:23] y'all know
[1:18:25] but yet he came to her
[1:18:29] they put her in the midst to do some
[1:18:31] damage to her
[1:18:32] not realizing that judgment was standing
[1:18:34] right that consequently right before
[1:18:36] them too
[1:18:42] and they say unto him master
[1:18:46] this Word of Life person
[1:18:51] they've done this they've done that and
[1:18:53] blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
[1:18:55] blah blah and they go on and on and on
[1:18:57] was taken in adultery in the very act I
[1:19:00] saw them do it I heard the words come
[1:19:03] out of their mouth they can't be saved
[1:19:05] ain't no way
[1:19:08] did you pray for her
[1:19:12] did you put your arm around him and say
[1:19:14] brother you shouldn't have said that
[1:19:16] there's a better way
[1:19:18] [Music]
[1:19:21] that's meddling
[1:19:23] but it's true anyhow
[1:19:26] now Moses here they go
[1:19:29] now brother Branham said
[1:19:32] um
[1:19:33] the modern day Pharisees
[1:19:36] in the law commanded us that such should
[1:19:39] be stoned
[1:19:41] we've been given occasion to to get rid
[1:19:44] of this person
[1:19:46] bless God
[1:19:49] paragraph 10
[1:19:51] 1961
[1:19:53] .
[1:19:55] huh
[1:19:58] it's the same spirit
[1:20:00] it's the same anointing it's the same
[1:20:03] devil
[1:20:05] I don't want to talk too loud I don't
[1:20:06] want to scare him just yet
[1:20:09] I want them to think he's got some Edge
[1:20:11] on this service
[1:20:17] to him that they might have to have to
[1:20:19] accuse him but Jesus
[1:20:21] stooped down
[1:20:24] so here this woman was and what strikes
[1:20:27] me so profoundly in this unfolding
[1:20:31] is that they were in church
[1:20:35] now you would think this would be the
[1:20:38] one place for her to find Refuge
[1:20:43] not that people would talk about her
[1:20:48] I'm gonna sit down for a little bit
[1:20:51] come to church
[1:20:53] to get help
[1:20:55] and out in the vestibule we're in the
[1:20:58] Sunday School room come on kids
[1:21:01] huh
[1:21:03] don't include them talk about them
[1:21:07] Church
[1:21:08] Folk
[1:21:10] should be in a position and a condition
[1:21:12] always
[1:21:14] to be of help
[1:21:16] it's not just the job of the man
[1:21:18] standing in this pulpit
[1:21:24] and no disrespect to the way I'm gonna
[1:21:26] say this
[1:21:27] it is not dependent upon Donnie Reagan
[1:21:30] solely
[1:21:32] huh
[1:21:34] there are people that come through those
[1:21:35] doors visitors that he may never date
[1:21:37] lay eyes on did you shake oh Lord let me
[1:21:40] shut up
[1:21:41] did you shake their hand did you tell
[1:21:43] them welcome
[1:21:45] I don't know who they are and I tell my
[1:21:47] kids I was telling them just the other
[1:21:48] day you better position yourself to be
[1:21:51] kind
[1:21:53] to the young people young people hear me
[1:21:57] huh
[1:21:59] well they're not a part of our group
[1:22:00] what is that
[1:22:02] [Applause]
[1:22:06] we're part of the body are we not
[1:22:09] yeah
[1:22:10] I wonder if I can find a place to hide
[1:22:15] got a lot of room a lot of places here
[1:22:16] now we find a lot of places to hide but
[1:22:18] let me let me go on I'm like oh that's
[1:22:19] so much I want to get to
[1:22:21] my praise the Lord but the woman in the
[1:22:23] midst
[1:22:24] so in church
[1:22:28] the eyes weren't compassionate the eyes
[1:22:31] were glaring at this little lady
[1:22:34] church folk
[1:22:36] glaring at somebody that needed help
[1:22:39] Brother JD
[1:22:41] she needed help
[1:22:44] the sermon hadn't even yet started
[1:22:48] she needed help
[1:22:52] the words were critical
[1:22:55] when they should have been loving and
[1:22:57] welcoming
[1:22:59] and the pronouncement that was that were
[1:23:02] coming that was riding on those words
[1:23:03] was killer
[1:23:06] she ain't worth two cents
[1:23:08] she ain't worth half a penny she ain't
[1:23:10] worth nothing
[1:23:12] church folk
[1:23:14] Sanctified Folk
[1:23:16] message Folk
[1:23:19] some of the honors meanest people on the
[1:23:22] face of the Earth
[1:23:25] yeah
[1:23:27] I said it where's my camera where
[1:23:29] whichever
[1:23:32] huh message Folk
[1:23:36] s
[1:23:39] because being called into this Royal
[1:23:41] thing
[1:23:42] there's some fish that's in that net
[1:23:44] that's not Royal but they think that
[1:23:46] they are
[1:23:48] huh
[1:23:50] people get a little money and they go to
[1:23:51] you know but let that stock market crash
[1:23:58] criticism
[1:24:00] there is a voice that's greater than
[1:24:01] criticism
[1:24:03] there are eyes that are more penetrating
[1:24:05] which see deeper than the situation
[1:24:09] and there is a verdict that's greater
[1:24:10] than that of the jury
[1:24:14] woman
[1:24:15] in the midst
[1:24:18] both the preachers
[1:24:20] and the congregation we're bringing
[1:24:23] judgment on this girl
[1:24:25] no hope
[1:24:27] for her in church
[1:24:30] maybe you're visiting today you you you
[1:24:33] you currently go to a church maybe and
[1:24:35] you just don't fit in
[1:24:40] there's room for you here
[1:24:46] at Word of Life Church
[1:24:51] that's a little weak but I'll take it
[1:24:54] that's enough fuel for me
[1:24:57] they might get my Pew they might get my
[1:24:59] seat Well they might need you a seat
[1:25:03] you ain't doing nothing with it
[1:25:06] ah
[1:25:10] so no doubt this was a very low day for
[1:25:13] this woman Micah is that out of pocket
[1:25:17] he talks about me all the time you say
[1:25:19] in the out-of-pocket stuff
[1:25:21] I try to make it truth though son just
[1:25:24] so you know
[1:25:25] he'll explain that you ask him talk
[1:25:27] about talk to him he'll tell you what
[1:25:28] I'm talking about
[1:25:29] no doubt this was a very low day for
[1:25:31] this woman
[1:25:33] and in fact
[1:25:35] it could have been that she was getting
[1:25:38] ready to surrender to her fate
[1:25:40] what she thought
[1:25:42] was the accumulation
[1:25:46] of degradation
[1:25:48] and the weight of her past
[1:25:52] and she was just saying I can't take it
[1:25:54] anymore I've come to church and I
[1:25:56] thought I was going to get some help but
[1:25:57] they didn't even shake my hand when I
[1:25:59] came through the door nobody talks to me
[1:26:01] anyway anymore when I come to church I'm
[1:26:03] in this situation a divorce all of these
[1:26:05] things my mama did this and I'm just
[1:26:07] coming with my Grandmama and all the
[1:26:09] people know it and nobody welcomes me
[1:26:11] hear me
[1:26:15] can I be real
[1:26:17] don't act like you don't know these
[1:26:19] things go on
[1:26:22] but she may have been about ready to
[1:26:24] surrender to her fate
[1:26:27] and watch this verse 6 and they said
[1:26:30] tempting him that they might have
[1:26:32] occasion to accuse him but Jesus
[1:26:35] stooped down
[1:26:40] I pray to God that there are situations
[1:26:43] in this church today and I want you to
[1:26:46] know that Jesus is here and he's coming
[1:26:49] by right by where you are and he's
[1:26:51] stooping down
[1:26:53] come on
[1:26:55] one signification of that act is that he
[1:26:59] is willing to go your your situation may
[1:27:02] be low so low
[1:27:05] so very low brother Joel you don't know
[1:27:07] how low but Jesus is stooping down lower
[1:27:12] than where you are
[1:27:15] lower than the mess that you're in
[1:27:17] he's willing to take on that
[1:27:20] identification for you
[1:27:25] he's willing to do that
[1:27:29] I can imagine that this is this seems
[1:27:32] beginning to unfold and and and and and
[1:27:34] the clamor and everything that's
[1:27:36] happening and the noise killer Stoners
[1:27:39] send her away all of this noise and
[1:27:41] Jesus is there and he's watching the
[1:27:44] crowd he's looking back at her
[1:27:47] he's looking at them not saying a word
[1:27:49] not breathing anything but he's watching
[1:27:52] this scene unfold and just as about sis
[1:27:56] was about to break about to give in he
[1:27:59] Stoops down
[1:28:02] he's stooping down again today here in
[1:28:05] 2023
[1:28:08] over 2 000 years since this event took
[1:28:11] place he's still in the business of
[1:28:12] stooping
[1:28:14] because he knows he knows that his wife
[1:28:18] his little bride his his lady elect his
[1:28:21] woman
[1:28:23] his main squeeze
[1:28:27] his cocoa in his puffs
[1:28:34] she sometimes gets in trouble
[1:28:39] she sometimes does things she ought not
[1:28:41] to have done because she somehow loses
[1:28:44] her identity she she has amnesia
[1:28:48] I'm talking to somebody today
[1:28:52] now you that are do you know that are
[1:28:54] that are converted strength in your
[1:28:56] brother and say Amen to these things
[1:28:58] [Applause]
[1:29:01] just as she's about to break
[1:29:03] Jesus Stoops
[1:29:06] and this very action
[1:29:09] in addition to him being willing to go
[1:29:11] low was also it also signified to the
[1:29:15] the individuals that that in in this
[1:29:18] scene
[1:29:19] he was sending a message to them I'm not
[1:29:22] even regarding what you're saying
[1:29:25] I'm not even paying I'm not even
[1:29:27] listening to what you're saying
[1:29:29] so we have the power the ability and the
[1:29:32] calling and the opportunity today to not
[1:29:34] even listen to what the devil says
[1:29:39] to to not even be caught up in his
[1:29:42] environment
[1:29:44] huh
[1:29:46] is that true
[1:29:48] instead of coming in and and bickering
[1:29:50] and fighting he says in the message of
[1:29:52] token we're not to come together to talk
[1:29:54] about the message
[1:29:55] just while I'm here I'm gonna read this
[1:29:57] it don't really fit in but I thought of
[1:29:58] this we are to come together to get in
[1:30:01] the message
[1:30:03] hmm
[1:30:04] and the message is Christ he is the word
[1:30:07] that's right we're to get into it get
[1:30:09] beneath it yes sir he says that's what
[1:30:13] we're supposed to do so to get in it to
[1:30:15] get beneath it
[1:30:17] now if you're underneath something
[1:30:20] huh
[1:30:21] you're underneath something
[1:30:23] that no longer makes you the big man on
[1:30:25] top
[1:30:30] um
[1:30:32] well the dominating female on the top
[1:30:38] hmm witchcraft
[1:30:40] why'd I say that
[1:30:43] sis you need to shake that thing
[1:30:49] I'll leave a note for brother Donnie he
[1:30:51] might want to follow up on these things
[1:30:52] though
[1:30:56] but he was sending a message to them I'm
[1:30:58] not listening to you
[1:31:00] it was intentional
[1:31:03] it was purposeful
[1:31:05] in that he was saying I give you no
[1:31:08] regard
[1:31:09] I give you no place
[1:31:12] I'm not even hearing what you're saying
[1:31:16] and as I was saying you may think your
[1:31:18] situation is low it's bad let me tell
[1:31:21] you Jesus went lower than that
[1:31:26] Galatians 1 and 4 who gave himself for
[1:31:29] our sins that he might Deliver Us from
[1:31:31] this present evil world
[1:31:34] according to the will of God and our
[1:31:36] father where deliver means to pluck out
[1:31:40] to choose out for oneself so let one
[1:31:43] person from many
[1:31:47] I don't know particularly what your
[1:31:49] situation may be but you've been given
[1:31:51] an opportunity to get out of that
[1:31:53] situation and there are others who are
[1:31:55] in the same situation but have not been
[1:31:57] given the same opportunity you've been
[1:31:59] given so take your tents take your
[1:32:02] opportunity today
[1:32:03] fully Embrace this word today that's
[1:32:06] coming to you
[1:32:08] you've been plucked out of your
[1:32:10] situation this lady was being plucked
[1:32:12] out and she didn't even realize it she
[1:32:14] was being plucked out
[1:32:15] of her situation out of that evil world
[1:32:18] that she was in evil means full of
[1:32:20] laborers annoyances hardships pressured
[1:32:22] and harassed by laborers Galatians 1 and
[1:32:24] 5 to whom be glory forever and ever amen
[1:32:26] Philippians 2 and 6 who being in the
[1:32:29] form of God thought it not robbery to be
[1:32:32] equal with God so you think your
[1:32:34] situation is low he went lower than that
[1:32:38] but he made himself of no reputation he
[1:32:42] deprived himself of the force and the
[1:32:44] ability that he had he emptied himself
[1:32:47] out the great canosis that brother
[1:32:49] Donnie has been speaking about so so so
[1:32:51] wonderfully and and to make he made
[1:32:53] himself void of who he was all for you
[1:33:00] he stripped himself of his deity in
[1:33:03] order to do that for you
[1:33:06] to do that for me Colossians 1 12 given
[1:33:09] thanks unto the Father which hath made
[1:33:11] us meet to be partakers of the
[1:33:13] inheritance of the Saints in light
[1:33:14] there's that word inheritance again
[1:33:17] Colossians 1 and 13 who have delivered
[1:33:19] us from the power of darkness and hath
[1:33:21] translated us into the kingdom of his
[1:33:23] dear son we have been snatched out of
[1:33:26] Darkness
[1:33:27] think about that Saints we have been
[1:33:30] taken out of our conditions
[1:33:34] as much room as we have now in as high
[1:33:37] as these ceilings are there should be
[1:33:38] nothing to hold us back
[1:33:41] not one thing when we realized what he
[1:33:44] did for us what how he transformed who
[1:33:47] we were
[1:33:49] sure
[1:33:52] the rafters up there
[1:33:55] are no chandeliers to swing from and I
[1:33:57] found something to swing from
[1:34:00] ma when you get to thinking about what
[1:34:01] God has done what and not only what God
[1:34:03] has done but what God is doing
[1:34:06] and then you Captivate that and you
[1:34:08] bottle that up and then you begin to
[1:34:09] think about what God is going to do
[1:34:16] my
[1:34:19] who is the image of the invisible God
[1:34:21] the firstborn of every creature an image
[1:34:23] it's not a resemblance but it's the
[1:34:27] exact
[1:34:28] image
[1:34:30] huh the fullness
[1:34:33] and Jesus was the body that carried the
[1:34:36] name of God
[1:34:40] and there stood that name of God before
[1:34:42] this woman
[1:34:45] this woman was about to be awakened to
[1:34:47] the realities of who she was
[1:34:51] we could run off a list
[1:34:54] of conditions of circumstances of
[1:34:58] anointings
[1:34:59] on people's lives
[1:35:02] here and listening to to me by way of
[1:35:05] the internet and pick it up archive
[1:35:06] later
[1:35:07] a thief
[1:35:09] a liar
[1:35:11] a chief
[1:35:13] a
[1:35:15] a doubter
[1:35:16] a whoremonger
[1:35:18] a self-abuser an idolater
[1:35:21] an alcoholic
[1:35:23] a lesbian a homosexual
[1:35:27] abusers of mankind
[1:35:30] an addict
[1:35:32] a gossiper
[1:35:34] caught up in the occult
[1:35:38] huh now I'm not giving place to the
[1:35:40] devil I'm not opening things up because
[1:35:42] the spirit of the Prophet that's subject
[1:35:43] to the prophet I'm calling attention to
[1:35:45] these things to make you aware that
[1:35:47] these are conditions in people's lives
[1:35:52] and they've come to church to get help
[1:35:57] huh
[1:35:59] because he oftentimes will go way beyond
[1:36:03] our problem that we're in he'll go Way
[1:36:05] Beyond the circumstance he'll go Way
[1:36:07] Beyond the condition
[1:36:09] and what he will do is he will strike
[1:36:12] something that's a part of himself
[1:36:14] within us
[1:36:17] in order to release that part of us that
[1:36:19] is him
[1:36:21] in order to bring healing and
[1:36:22] deliverance so what are you saying
[1:36:24] brother Joel Victory is already in you
[1:36:30] is that right
[1:36:32] because the problem that you're going
[1:36:34] through the problem that you have it's
[1:36:36] just temporary
[1:36:39] but yet so many times we want to cabbage
[1:36:41] down on our current situation and we get
[1:36:44] trapped in that thing and it's over and
[1:36:46] over and repetition is the same old
[1:36:48] thing same old thing over and over and
[1:36:51] that's exactly where the devil wants you
[1:36:52] to be
[1:36:55] so God will take that situation and
[1:36:57] instead of dealing specifically with
[1:37:00] that situation he'll go way beyond that
[1:37:03] thing and he'll strike something deep
[1:37:05] down within you that you didn't even
[1:37:07] know was there a moment he strikes out
[1:37:10] with that word it will Quicken something
[1:37:11] within you
[1:37:13] and what is it it's a part of himself
[1:37:17] because only he the strength that he has
[1:37:20] the only thing that can withstand a
[1:37:22] punch from eternity is eternity itself
[1:37:27] because if he punched you exactly where
[1:37:29] you were it would take you out of here
[1:37:31] so he has to go down through the Avenues
[1:37:34] of your life maybe you come to church
[1:37:35] today going down through those Avenues
[1:37:37] of your life and he'll strike something
[1:37:38] that's so deep within who you are
[1:37:41] because it's a part of himself and the
[1:37:44] moment that connection is made there's
[1:37:46] something released in The Believer
[1:37:50] it gives him that overcoming power it
[1:37:52] gives them Victory because it's already
[1:37:54] in you
[1:37:56] healing is already in you
[1:38:00] is that right
[1:38:02] the Sabbath that's needed for grief is
[1:38:05] already in you
[1:38:08] I know when my precious mom died and you
[1:38:11] all probably heard me say it but I had
[1:38:12] to learn to lean on God in a different
[1:38:14] way
[1:38:15] because this was a new thing in my life
[1:38:17] I only have one mama
[1:38:20] and she left this world
[1:38:23] it broke my heart
[1:38:25] I was there and I I heard literally the
[1:38:28] last breath leave her body
[1:38:30] and I couldn't help but think at that
[1:38:31] time here I was being there on the day
[1:38:34] that I was born
[1:38:36] and here I was on the day that she left
[1:38:39] it was a beautiful thing
[1:38:42] and it's helped me so much during that
[1:38:44] time to to because you know just having
[1:38:46] a hard time and and and and and and the
[1:38:49] the knowing that
[1:38:52] as Josiah walked in the room that day
[1:38:55] at that particular time and she had her
[1:38:57] hand up and she was saying oh wow
[1:39:03] my family we helped to get her to that
[1:39:06] place
[1:39:10] huh
[1:39:14] it's not an easy thing to have two women
[1:39:16] in your house
[1:39:21] excuse me
[1:39:24] that's just a reality Saints
[1:39:26] that's just so
[1:39:28] but knowing that we helped her to get to
[1:39:31] that place to where she could have that
[1:39:33] oh wow moment
[1:39:36] who is it in your life
[1:39:38] that you can help get to that moment
[1:39:41] not so much as they're going to die but
[1:39:43] that they can realize you know because
[1:39:45] you were kind to me when I came to Word
[1:39:47] of Life Church
[1:39:48] oh wow I didn't know all of this was
[1:39:52] mine I didn't know I possessed all of
[1:39:54] these things
[1:39:59] because it just takes a voice greater
[1:40:01] than that of your circumstance to make
[1:40:03] you aware of these things
[1:40:05] he wants to connect you to himself which
[1:40:08] is really connecting you to the real you
[1:40:12] is that right
[1:40:13] because when this happens it's not about
[1:40:16] him but it's about you
[1:40:18] what did he say you shall do the Greater
[1:40:20] Works not I shall do the Greater Works
[1:40:23] so it's finally all about you
[1:40:30] It's All About You in Christ
[1:40:35] knowing who you are releases the power
[1:40:37] of God
[1:40:40] Saint John 8 9 back to our scene and
[1:40:43] they which heard it being convicted by
[1:40:44] their own conscience went out one by one
[1:40:47] beginning at the eldest even to the to
[1:40:48] the last and Jesus was left alone and
[1:40:50] the woman standing in the midst and when
[1:40:52] Jesus had lifted up himself and saw none
[1:40:55] but the woman he said unto her woman
[1:40:58] where are those thine accusers hath no
[1:41:01] man condemned thee
[1:41:03] and I love this
[1:41:05] she said no man Lord
[1:41:08] you can't tell me those ears were not
[1:41:11] still ringing with those bitter hurtful
[1:41:14] words
[1:41:16] you can't tell me that something within
[1:41:18] her wasn't being reminded of who she was
[1:41:22] because of that clamor was there
[1:41:24] reminding her of who she was
[1:41:26] but yet her testimony was this no man
[1:41:28] Lord and Jesus said unto her neither do
[1:41:31] I condemn thee go
[1:41:32] and sin
[1:41:34] no more
[1:41:38] everyone else was gone
[1:41:40] it was just her and Jesus
[1:41:43] the atmosphere in the room shifted
[1:41:48] something happened
[1:41:50] it didn't matter who was sitting beside
[1:41:52] her didn't matter who was on the right
[1:41:53] or on the left
[1:41:55] she was there because a word had just
[1:41:58] been given to her and it was hers and
[1:42:01] hers alone
[1:42:03] she knew from that moment something was
[1:42:06] different
[1:42:09] so when she said no man Lord
[1:42:12] she realized that not only had the
[1:42:14] physical appearance and the physical
[1:42:17] presence of her accusers had been
[1:42:19] deleted
[1:42:23] bloop
[1:42:25] delete
[1:42:27] that's a powerful button isn't it
[1:42:29] huh
[1:42:31] but all of this had been deleted
[1:42:33] but not only that but also her guilt
[1:42:37] her shame
[1:42:39] it had been totally eradicated
[1:42:42] there was no more need for her to hold
[1:42:44] on to these things because he said where
[1:42:48] are they I don't see them so why should
[1:42:51] you
[1:42:55] if God doesn't see the accusers in your
[1:42:59] life why should you still harp on these
[1:43:01] things
[1:43:02] is that all right
[1:43:04] and even the acceptance of what they had
[1:43:07] said she was it was deleted bloop
[1:43:12] it was all gone praise God my sins are
[1:43:15] gone
[1:43:18] because no doubt she herself would
[1:43:20] probably even prepared to die well this
[1:43:23] is it they're gonna Stone me I got
[1:43:25] called
[1:43:26] huh she'd prepared herself to be taken
[1:43:30] under to be taken over
[1:43:33] because this this this was a major step
[1:43:35] she'd been accused of saints
[1:43:37] huh
[1:43:39] it wasn't like she'd snuck out after
[1:43:41] curfew
[1:43:43] uh oh but Joel where are you going what
[1:43:46] do you know
[1:43:47] I don't know you tell me
[1:43:49] why'd I say that
[1:43:52] it wasn't that she was somewhere right
[1:43:54] behind the building puffing on a
[1:43:55] cigarette
[1:43:57] um
[1:43:58] is that all right
[1:44:01] she didn't steal a candy bar this was
[1:44:02] some big stuff
[1:44:05] is that right
[1:44:06] her sin was so great but Saints her
[1:44:10] forgiveness was greater than her seed
[1:44:15] the opportunity of forgiveness at the
[1:44:17] beginning
[1:44:18] greater than any
[1:44:20] you have done all that you have to do is
[1:44:23] just hit delete
[1:44:26] it's gone
[1:44:27] it's gone and it's not in a cash file
[1:44:30] it's not in the junk mail folder it's
[1:44:33] gone
[1:44:36] there ain't no I.T guy anywhere that can
[1:44:38] recover these things
[1:44:41] it's gone did you hear me it's gone
[1:44:47] because when the master hits that button
[1:44:49] you can rest assured
[1:44:52] no man Lord
[1:44:55] she could have held on to that guilt and
[1:44:57] that shame and it would have led to her
[1:44:59] demise she would have been taken out of
[1:45:01] here it should have been gone she was a
[1:45:03] prisoner Bound by the circumstances and
[1:45:06] in her mind
[1:45:07] but her confession
[1:45:09] you've been hearing about confession
[1:45:10] lately in the services but her
[1:45:12] confession and her response was nobody
[1:45:17] nobody not even the Devil Himself
[1:45:23] I don't care who you are I don't care
[1:45:25] how much money you have I don't care how
[1:45:26] much money you don't
[1:45:29] I don't care where you've been I don't
[1:45:31] care where you're going
[1:45:33] I don't care where you are I'm just
[1:45:35] letting you know that there is an
[1:45:36] opportunity for you to be free from
[1:45:38] these things
[1:45:41] woman in the midst
[1:45:46] and the Lord God said unto the woman
[1:45:48] Genesis 3 and 13 we find another woman
[1:45:53] because see this woman that we read
[1:45:54] about she was holding on to what was
[1:45:56] going to kill her
[1:46:00] thank you brother Terry did you hear
[1:46:02] what I just said
[1:46:05] she was holding on to the very thing
[1:46:07] that was going to kill her
[1:46:11] the thing that you're holding on to it
[1:46:12] will destroy you
[1:46:15] hear the word of the Lord today
[1:46:17] Let It Go
[1:46:20] Genesis 3 and 13 and the Lord God said
[1:46:23] unto the woman
[1:46:24] what is this that thou has done
[1:46:27] one question
[1:46:30] one
[1:46:32] and the woman said I
[1:46:34] well
[1:46:36] you see
[1:46:37] what happened was
[1:46:40] and when you hear that somebody's about
[1:46:42] ready to make a big old lie
[1:46:45] well they gonna try to remove themselves
[1:46:47] from that situation
[1:46:48] see what happened was that that serpent
[1:46:51] beguiled me and I did eat she began
[1:46:54] playing the blame game
[1:46:56] so Eve was asked a specific question and
[1:46:59] this woman was also asked a specific
[1:47:02] question actually too
[1:47:05] where are your accusers and hath no man
[1:47:08] condemned thee
[1:47:09] two questions but only one answer
[1:47:14] why
[1:47:16] because when you have truth
[1:47:19] you don't need to talk a lot
[1:47:22] you can say what you got to say and move
[1:47:24] on
[1:47:27] you don't have to explain
[1:47:29] you don't have to give reason
[1:47:33] why because your memory has been deleted
[1:47:41] huh
[1:47:44] there's power in few words
[1:47:47] you
[1:47:48] are not defined by what you've done
[1:47:52] hear me we're closing
[1:47:55] you are not defined by what others say
[1:47:58] that you are
[1:48:02] you say who do you think you are but
[1:48:03] Joel who gives you that Authority this
[1:48:05] word right here
[1:48:07] I stand sure-footed I stand firm
[1:48:10] what does brother Andrew say I I I I I I
[1:48:13] said what I meant and I said it I
[1:48:16] believe it so I say it whatever he says
[1:48:17] that
[1:48:18] but there's no need to back up when you
[1:48:20] speak in truth
[1:48:22] people are going to come against you
[1:48:23] people are going to question it sure but
[1:48:25] you are not defined by the things that
[1:48:27] you've done
[1:48:29] because the reality is God defines Who
[1:48:32] You Are
[1:48:34] sinner insane alike
[1:48:36] so so don't worry about what you've done
[1:48:39] so much
[1:48:41] yes it might be bad
[1:48:43] yes it might be embarrassing
[1:48:47] it might even be shameful
[1:48:49] but remember
[1:48:50] Jesus made his reputation among people
[1:48:53] who did these types of things
[1:48:57] hmm
[1:49:01] that's who he hung out with
[1:49:04] is that right
[1:49:08] now again not to not to stir up anything
[1:49:11] on the negative side but I want I want
[1:49:13] just do something for me just a moment
[1:49:16] I want you to take just a second
[1:49:18] and think about maybe a bad thing that's
[1:49:21] captivating you now
[1:49:23] think about it I'll give you a second
[1:49:27] you know what
[1:49:29] he died for that
[1:49:32] now think about something else
[1:49:36] he died for that too
[1:49:40] Jesus Christ died for that
[1:49:44] Jesus Christ gave his life so that you
[1:49:48] no longer have to struggle with that
[1:49:50] whatever that was
[1:49:53] here
[1:49:55] he's real
[1:49:57] he wants to give us these things more
[1:50:00] than we even realize that we need them
[1:50:04] is that true
[1:50:06] First Corinthians 6 and 10. I said tight
[1:50:10] book
[1:50:12] those Corinthian characters they were
[1:50:13] some they were some bad dudes
[1:50:19] because Paul when he's addressing them
[1:50:23] he talks about
[1:50:25] them being fornicators you're gonna come
[1:50:27] back to this list again
[1:50:29] there were idolaters there were
[1:50:31] adulterers there were those who were
[1:50:34] effeminate
[1:50:35] come on Saints
[1:50:37] the sodomites
[1:50:39] they were thieves they were Covetous
[1:50:41] they were drunkards they were revilers
[1:50:43] they were extortioners
[1:50:46] they were abusers of themselves with
[1:50:48] mankind men laying with men women laying
[1:50:51] with women
[1:50:53] if we ain't here saying huh
[1:50:57] but even in all of that Paul says and
[1:51:01] such were some of you
[1:51:08] calling sin sin not excusing it by no
[1:51:11] means but it's looking at dead in the
[1:51:13] face and said you are that you were that
[1:51:15] you did that but
[1:51:17] that's what you were
[1:51:20] but you are washed ye are Sanctified but
[1:51:25] ye are justified in the name of the Lord
[1:51:27] Jesus and by the spirit of our God
[1:51:33] because he does his best work in some of
[1:51:36] these situations
[1:51:38] to take somebody and wash them and clean
[1:51:41] them and make them a person different
[1:51:42] than what they used to be
[1:51:45] as the musicians come the woman in the
[1:51:47] midst
[1:51:49] caught in a circumstance caught in a
[1:51:52] situation
[1:51:54] she didn't realize it but there was
[1:51:57] another life on the inside of her
[1:52:02] that had to be in a condition to receive
[1:52:05] the life that was to come
[1:52:10] if I can take just a second
[1:52:12] this one's just for me okay just for me
[1:52:15] I love this quote I love this one
[1:52:20] it's again she didn't realize that that
[1:52:21] that she had to have a change before the
[1:52:25] change could come
[1:52:27] so Jesus had to find her in that
[1:52:29] condition Jesus came to where she was
[1:52:31] Jesus come to your situation he come
[1:52:34] into the filth and the mire and the muck
[1:52:36] and everything
[1:52:38] to find you
[1:52:43] the question is asked please explain the
[1:52:47] mystery of the translation of the Bride
[1:52:50] wow again excuse me for a moment I'm at
[1:52:54] home I'm gonna kick my feet up all right
[1:52:57] he says just to change see our bodies
[1:52:59] let's say you know what I mean when I
[1:53:01] say that I don't mean to be sacrilegious
[1:53:02] I don't mean to say hours I don't mean
[1:53:04] to say this church I mean to say every
[1:53:06] believer Abraham he was looking for a
[1:53:08] promised son that was promised him is
[1:53:10] that right
[1:53:11] and the church is looking for a promised
[1:53:14] son
[1:53:15] the bride is that right the bride is
[1:53:17] looking for the promised son she better
[1:53:20] be
[1:53:21] you better be looking for the promised
[1:53:23] son
[1:53:25] huh
[1:53:26] because before the promised son could
[1:53:29] come to Sarah and Abraham
[1:53:31] their bodies had to be changed
[1:53:36] the condition that their bodies were in
[1:53:39] there was no way that they were going to
[1:53:40] bring forth a child
[1:53:42] the condition that you're in there's no
[1:53:45] way that you're going to take a rapture
[1:53:50] where my safe Folks at
[1:53:53] y'all supposed to be strengthening your
[1:53:55] brethren
[1:53:58] huh
[1:54:01] I thought y'all don't want that on me
[1:54:03] she was too old to have a baby she had
[1:54:06] no milk veins in her breasts her breasts
[1:54:08] was dried up her womb wasn't fertile she
[1:54:10] was sterile she could not have the baby
[1:54:12] her heart was too old to stand labor
[1:54:17] if the power of God would drop on you
[1:54:19] right now in your condition you would
[1:54:21] not be able to withstand that rapture
[1:54:25] hmm
[1:54:28] I gotta clean up what I messed up
[1:54:33] hmm
[1:54:34] so what happened God changed her back to
[1:54:36] a young woman and he did Abraham the
[1:54:38] same thing because he said his body was
[1:54:41] as good as Dead Sea and he had to change
[1:54:43] their body in order to receive the
[1:54:45] promised son and we cannot receive the
[1:54:47] promised son that's promised us today in
[1:54:49] these bodies that we live in these
[1:54:51] bodies are sin amen
[1:54:54] now you cute folk that's a quote for you
[1:54:58] your body is sin
[1:55:02] the first conscience controls the body
[1:55:03] we see field taste of all here and it's
[1:55:05] just got us all scrupled up
[1:55:07] well I thought well I felt led that you
[1:55:10] scrupled up
[1:55:12] that's what your Prophet said you're
[1:55:14] scrupled up
[1:55:16] anytime you go to relying on the these
[1:55:19] these these Avenues
[1:55:21] we reason and everything else but that
[1:55:22] new body that comes from this Born Again
[1:55:25] it'll pass away it's that inside
[1:55:28] something that lives
[1:55:30] everybody understand and say Amen it's
[1:55:32] not this outside see tasteful smell here
[1:55:34] it isn't it's subject to death and will
[1:55:37] die but the inside part of you down in
[1:55:40] here inside that is the person that
[1:55:43] cannot die
[1:55:45] woman in the midst
[1:55:48] here she is about to die that body
[1:55:52] that old dusty devilish frame
[1:55:55] that we so dress up and Doctor up and
[1:55:58] take care of we brush his hair brush his
[1:56:00] teeth praise God you do that as brother
[1:56:02] Donnie says for the sake of those
[1:56:03] sitting around you please do that
[1:56:08] but we'll go to the Fine Mall the stores
[1:56:10] and we'll buy fancy clothes and put on
[1:56:12] this old body it's just death
[1:56:16] it's subject to death and will die
[1:56:19] and that's the person that the New Life
[1:56:21] Starts from listen to how he places this
[1:56:23] that's the person that the New Life
[1:56:26] Starts from from this new birth
[1:56:30] you got to be born again
[1:56:33] because the new life that's coming that
[1:56:36] he's promised that's where it begins
[1:56:40] that's what it comes to and it builds
[1:56:43] another person listen
[1:56:46] it builds another person in the image of
[1:56:50] this person you are
[1:56:54] so he has to have some material to work
[1:56:56] with
[1:56:57] and he can't use this old dusty devilish
[1:57:00] thing
[1:57:01] he can't use your opinion he can't use
[1:57:04] your thoughts
[1:57:07] you must be born again so potentially
[1:57:09] it's in here and what is it the word
[1:57:11] promised before the foundation of the
[1:57:13] world and around there this only
[1:57:15] reflects the negative talking about this
[1:57:17] body that will reflect the positive the
[1:57:18] word see and the same thing or the
[1:57:21] translation of the Bride will be the
[1:57:22] same thing
[1:57:25] the word that's in you
[1:57:29] the body will materialize around that
[1:57:33] word
[1:57:36] as the same thing did to Sarah
[1:57:40] so the body
[1:57:43] the word that is in you becoming born
[1:57:46] again
[1:57:48] praise God my sins are gone
[1:57:50] I've been born again
[1:57:53] and the word that's already in you
[1:57:56] that body that's coming will material
[1:57:59] our eyes around that word so it is
[1:58:02] imperative
[1:58:05] read your Bible pray every day to
[1:58:08] strengthen that inner word to feed that
[1:58:12] inner word because there is a word
[1:58:14] coming to that word there's a body
[1:58:16] coming to that new changed body and
[1:58:18] that's the only way it can materialize
[1:58:23] something that he's created
[1:58:26] he's coming to that
[1:58:29] that deposit of Eternity that he put in
[1:58:32] you put in me put in every believer
[1:58:33] that's what he's coming back for
[1:58:37] that's the only thing that can be
[1:58:39] quickened
[1:58:42] woman
[1:58:44] what are you in the midst of today
[1:58:46] little bride
[1:58:48] what's your circumstances today
[1:58:53] you've been presented with a word today
[1:58:54] that will totally change who you are
[1:59:00] because you cannot you cannot I assure
[1:59:03] you of this you cannot base your Forever
[1:59:07] on what you see right now
[1:59:10] hear me
[1:59:12] if you try to base your Forever on what
[1:59:15] you're seeing right now you're going to
[1:59:16] be resentful
[1:59:18] nobody's going to want to be around you
[1:59:21] because there has to be something more
[1:59:23] to take place
[1:59:25] let's bow our heads
[1:59:29] Heavenly Father we love you
[1:59:33] and we thank you for your word
[1:59:36] we thank you for the change that's come

[2:20:58] all the time
[2:21:03] it's not his life will shine God is good
[2:21:09] my God is good all the time

[2:22:08] through the darkest night his light will
[2:22:14] shine God is good
[2:22:17] God is good
[2:22:20] all the time
[2:22:23] but God is good
[2:22:26] all the time
