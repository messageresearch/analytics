[37:09] appreciate the Lord moving for our
[37:10] Brethren my there's just so many things
[37:12] that that are going on and we certainly
[37:14] appreciate
[37:16] god let's read about
[37:19] um the
[37:21] shepherd Isaiah
[37:23] 5310 this is part of
[37:26] his reconciliation through the act of
[37:29] kosis him humbling
[37:32] himself yet it pleased the Lord to
[37:35] bruise
[37:36] him he hasth put him to
[37:40] grief when thou shalt
[37:43] make his soul an offering for
[37:49] sin his
[37:53] soul and what about the blood isn't the
[37:55] blood the offering yes isn't his body an
[38:00] offering yes wasn't his human nature
[38:04] yes you see everything about him in his
[38:08] entirety was an offering but don't leave
[38:12] out the soul we didn't need more blood
[38:17] now we talk about I'm a child of the
[38:19] king oh yes oh yes his Royal Blood
[38:21] throws from my veins well Bill and gor
[38:23] Glory when they wrote that many years
[38:24] ago they had a good thought but it's not
[38:26] true right it's is simply not true we do
[38:29] not have the blood of Jesus in our veins
[38:31] you've got Reagan blood you know
[38:33] whatever you are spiritually yes but it
[38:37] was more than his blood it wouldn't do a
[38:39] bit of good if he could take the literal
[38:41] blood of the Lord Jesus and drain every
[38:43] drop of my blood out and put his blood
[38:45] back in me I'd still be a
[38:47] sinner because my problem was a soul
[38:53] problem but he will put him to grief and
[38:56] thou shalt make his soul an offering for
[38:58] sin he shall isn't this prophecy he
[39:02] shall see his
[39:08] seed so this Messiah is promised to have
[39:12] a seed or a
[39:15] generation wow he shall see his seed he
[39:20] shall
[39:22] prolong his
[39:24] days and the pleasure of the Lord shall
[39:27] prom prosper in his hand he shall see
[39:30] the
[39:31] travail of his
[39:34] soul and he shall be
[39:37] satisfied by his knowledge shall my
[39:40] righteous servant justify
[39:44] many for he shall bear their
[39:49] iniquities therefore will I divide him a
[39:52] portion with the great and he shall
[39:56] divide the SP
[39:57] oil with the
[40:00] strong isn't that just like our
[40:04] Lord the spirit God will divide him the
[40:08] portion with the great and what does
[40:10] Jesus do Jesus turns right around and
[40:14] divides his reward his
[40:17] inheritance with
[40:20] us that's
[40:23] greatness he shall divide the spoil with
[40:26] the strong strong because he ha poured
[40:29] out notice how many times Isaiah keeps
[40:32] using this word
[40:35] Soul he has poured out his
[40:40] soul unto death he was
[40:44] numbered with the transgressors he bear
[40:47] the sin of
[40:52] many
[40:54] many and made intercept I for the
[41:00] transgressors
[41:03] my I so appreciate him for that don't
[41:06] you how many like to be remembered today
[41:10] prayer certain good say Brother D back
[41:12] in church with us today brother's really
[41:14] been going through a lot in his body and
[41:17] certainly appreciate the Lord moving for
[41:18] him laughy to continue to remember my
[41:21] daughter Alicia if you would she's
[41:23] feeling better but still not um feeling
[41:26] feeling herself yet also Erica be taking
[41:28] her fifth chemo treatment tomorrow
[41:31] Monday Tuesday and Wednesday we
[41:34] certainly would you remember your
[41:35] prayers are there whatever your need is
[41:37] today your request in your heart let's
[41:40] hold it right there as we approach him
[41:42] shall
[41:43] we heavenly father just reading your
[41:47] word humbles us
[41:51] Lord it makes us feel so
[41:54] small when we read such Prof profound
[41:59] words for a mortal man to do this for
[42:02] another mortal man would have been
[42:05] something but for an immortal
[42:08] being which never had a
[42:10] start to be willing to cond in sin to
[42:14] such a level to do this for
[42:16] us it's truly amazing Grace how sweet to
[42:21] sound yes Father you saw all the hands
[42:24] that were uplifted today signifying
[42:26] needs requests
[42:28] the needs of your people around the
[42:30] world are so great Lord as the days go
[42:34] by and they turn into weeks and I hear
[42:37] from Saints of yours from South Africa
[42:40] from France from Europe from Zimbabwe
[42:45] from India from all over the world the
[42:48] needs that they have in their lives
[42:50] their homes their churches we pray God
[42:53] that you would be mindful of the needs
[42:55] of your children
[42:58] Lord we know that we say it often here
[43:00] that we are a needy people we don't say
[43:04] it to signify how great our needs are
[43:07] versus that you are weak but we signify
[43:11] to you that our needs are so many and
[43:14] we're taught by the prophet to bring our
[43:17] requests before you and to ask for many
[43:21] things lots of them and great things so
[43:26] we do not feel we're pressing the limit
[43:29] to ask for healing for every child of
[43:33] God we are not pressing your limit that
[43:36] oh my if we would just add one more
[43:38] request it would make you overdrawn in
[43:41] heaven for Lord God we could never
[43:46] overdraw the account of what's laid up
[43:49] in store for those that love you so we
[43:53] ask for many things today we ask for
[43:56] healing for peace for comfort for
[44:00] deliverance father we love you and we
[44:03] believe that you'll take our petition
[44:06] you'll Grant it according to your will
[44:08] now as we look into your word and we
[44:11] Endeavor Lord God to speak about your
[44:15] great things I pray that you would help
[44:18] me you see Lord I'm a poor feeble
[44:23] mortal dear God what could I say that
[44:27] would help
[44:28] anyone what could I do oh I could study
[44:32] I could apply myself and I've given
[44:34] hours of preparation to maybe 45 minutes
[44:39] to an hour of speaking but what good
[44:42] would that do if you don't come and
[44:45] anoint our hearts so anoint me anoint
[44:48] the people help them to pull father on
[44:52] what they have need of would you grant
[44:54] it Lord God in the name of Jesus Jesus
[44:57] Christ and the Saints said amen God
[45:01] bless you you may be
[45:10] seated what a great
[45:13] sacrifice how could Spirit God be
[45:18] pleased with bruising IM
[45:22] mortal how could Spirit
[45:25] God take
[45:27] an element of pleasure by adding grief
[45:33] to a suffering
[45:36] human you know in the way that God views
[45:39] things it's so much different than we do
[45:42] in our
[45:43] minds and yet Isaiah is able to
[45:47] catch the epitome of that which is going
[45:51] to happen several thousand years after
[45:55] his prophecy
[45:57] I often wonder Brother Louie how it must
[45:59] have been for those prophets as they
[46:02] went into the realm of vision and they
[46:05] would see things that they probably
[46:09] would come back out and they would
[46:12] Ponder and wonder what could that mean
[46:15] who was that who was it about and it
[46:19] would leave them no doubt in a state of
[46:22] bewilderment that they were wondering
[46:24] was that a natural thing was that a
[46:28] spiritual thing that's going to happen
[46:31] what was it to see the Insight that God
[46:36] would have given them yet the mystery
[46:38] form that God would have kept from them
[46:41] and yet all they knew to do was just
[46:43] utter it and write it
[46:46] down was part of what they would say
[46:50] would come those in great words of thus
[46:53] sayeth the Lord but yet of part of their
[46:57] prophecies they would not actually say
[47:01] thus sayeth the Lord each time right we
[47:04] read of such here today but we're able
[47:08] to see by the inspiration of God given
[47:12] to these men as they were so inspired as
[47:16] David wrote in Psalms
[47:19] 22 and he again captured the great thing
[47:24] that was going to happen at Calvary but
[47:27] here God actually allowed David to enter
[47:31] so much into the prophecy it sounded
[47:35] like a drama it sounded like a play if
[47:40] you will that a person was acting out
[47:45] another person's position in something
[47:49] that had been or something that would be
[47:53] or something that could be right he just
[47:56] was wasn't sure but he felt such
[47:59] inspiration that he moved into this
[48:03] personal thing and it was almost like it
[48:06] was his
[48:08] personality if you listen real close you
[48:11] understand why God will have preachers
[48:13] to preach the way they do
[48:16] sometimes sometimes they will come in
[48:19] and begin to preach in the first person
[48:23] as if though it is them sometimes times
[48:27] they'll preach it as if though it's in
[48:29] the second person or the third person or
[48:34] they will preach it as if though they
[48:36] are a representative of the great person
[48:41] an understanding prophecy we know takes
[48:45] spiritual people to do so it's not like
[48:49] sitting down and reading a biography or
[48:51] an autobiography of somebody's life or
[48:55] picking up a newspaper today
[48:57] reading it in that sense but it takes
[49:00] people who know the
[49:03] author and they must be in the spirit of
[49:07] the great composer
[49:09] himself I like music I enjoy music and I
[49:14] always when I listen to something you
[49:18] know that's very very moving and I I
[49:21] like different compositions of music and
[49:24] I like one that was written many many
[49:26] many years ago called the swan it is the
[49:31] carnival of the animals and it is a
[49:35] classical piece and I've heard it
[49:38] performed by many different orchestras
[49:42] and they will feature either a violin or
[49:46] a a person that plays a cello they will
[49:48] take it and rewrite it for a cello or a
[49:52] guitar or whatever it might be and
[49:54] always Marvel because they will take the
[49:57] same sheet music and they will put a
[50:01] little bit of a A variation on it now
[50:04] the notes on a violin are somewhat
[50:07] different than that of a cello the cello
[50:09] is the the instrument that is the
[50:11] closest to the human voice so they say
[50:14] and that is the range by which it covers
[50:18] so it sounds more like a human voice so
[50:21] in the composition that brother renom
[50:23] referred to as Peter and the Wolf when
[50:26] it was being played that to use a violin
[50:29] or to use a guitar it would not be that
[50:33] which would represent the human voice so
[50:35] depending on what the comp composer
[50:38] would write he would choose a certain
[50:40] instrument that would be a concerto for
[50:44] a piano or it be might be the ninth
[50:47] composition in a flat minor or B flat or
[50:50] whatever he'd write and he would write
[50:52] it for a violin so well that's all well
[50:55] and good for a person to plays a violin
[50:57] but if they don't play a violin and they
[50:59] play a flute then they may have to take
[51:01] that same composition and rewrite it
[51:04] because their notes are somewhat
[51:06] different now there's notes that you can
[51:08] reach on a violin the the high SE some
[51:11] of the highest notes that reachable that
[51:13] you cannot reach on other instruments so
[51:16] you have to understand the music and the
[51:18] composition of the way it's written to
[51:20] be able to make sense out of the whole
[51:23] thing and God wrote his great story as a
[51:28] drama but he also wrote it as it was a
[51:33] great composition of music so in this
[51:36] phrase that we've read here today it is
[51:39] the composition of the father's drama
[51:42] that reaches a very sad place it's a
[51:46] place that lay in mystery form in the
[51:50] word for many many years people read it
[51:53] no doubt they tried to understand it so
[51:56] some of them probably thought it was the
[51:58] Messiah but by the time the Lord Jesus
[52:01] got there these scriptures were not some
[52:04] of the ones that they were actually
[52:06] looking for in the Fulfillment of the
[52:09] Messianic coming but they were looking
[52:12] for a messiah that would destroy
[52:16] Rome not
[52:18] sin so you don't find the Pharisees the
[52:22] ases the herodians you don't find them
[52:25] dwelling on the Prophecies of Isaiah
[52:29] 7:14 Isaiah
[52:31] 9:6 Isaiah
[52:33] 53:10 Isaiah
[52:36] 611 and 2 you don't find them dwelling
[52:40] on Micah 51 and two habac 3 Jeremiah 31
[52:48] you do not find them emphasizing
[52:50] Zachariah 14 you do not find them
[52:54] putting their emphasis but it is on the
[52:57] serpent Bruiser of Genesis 3 it is on
[53:01] the coming one of Deuteronomy the Lord
[53:04] your God shall raise up a prophet like
[53:07] unto me so they were taking part of the
[53:10] notes if I can say it that way from the
[53:12] scripture and they were rewriting the
[53:16] composition to make it fit their day
[53:20] instead of making their thought line up
[53:23] with the composition you understand they
[53:25] were taking taking the music notes or
[53:28] the Messianic prophecies and were
[53:31] realigning them and they wrote their own
[53:35] music and they wrote their own story and
[53:39] they took the father's words and put it
[53:42] together in a different way and made it
[53:45] tell a complete different story so
[53:46] whenever he appears according to the
[53:49] original sheet music they look right at
[53:52] it and they knew it so well that they
[53:54] could roll up a scroll and take a pen
[53:57] and Pierce through that scroll and tell
[53:59] you every letter of the word that it
[54:02] would come across now that's I guess
[54:04] impressible I'm not sure what good it
[54:05] would do you I'm not sure what good that
[54:07] would help you to overcome sin but
[54:09] apparently they must have thought it was
[54:10] outstanding because they did do it that
[54:12] way but it didn't do them any good it
[54:15] gave them no understanding of the
[54:16] Messiah gave them no power to overcome
[54:19] but they could brag about what they
[54:20] could do I suppose so you find With Many
[54:23] religious people that's what religion is
[54:25] about it's how they're able to succeed
[54:28] and do certain things and then they're
[54:30] able to brag about what they are but
[54:32] what I read here this morning gives me
[54:35] absolutely nothing to brag about at all
[54:38] what I read about here today actually
[54:40] gives you and I are no other Mortal I
[54:43] don't care if they're a prophet if
[54:44] they're a pastor if they're evangelist a
[54:46] songwriter musician it gives none of us
[54:49] anything to brag about is that right so
[54:52] there's only one great one really that
[54:54] is among us and that's the the Lord
[54:56] Jesus
[54:58] himself now if this was a part of the
[55:02] father's drama or the Sheep music that
[55:05] they would have looked at and maybe
[55:07] because on this Brother Lou is's no thus
[55:10] sayith the Lord after each verse no thus
[55:13] sayeth the Lord after each statement now
[55:15] the same Prophet would come over and say
[55:17] thus sayeth the Lord I'll do this and
[55:19] I'll show you a sign well they could
[55:21] take that as thus sayeth the Lord but
[55:23] sometimes prophets would just be saying
[55:26] words and they wouldn't say thus sayith
[55:28] the Lord and others would look at it and
[55:31] say well that was probably just his
[55:36] opinion well it could have
[55:40] been but it might not have
[55:43] been well you could be in big trouble if
[55:46] you think it was his opinion but
[55:49] actually it was the word of the Lord am
[55:53] now we find that even in the day of
[55:54] course that we're living in is people
[55:56] want to do our message exactly the same
[55:59] way but notice then when we go that he
[56:02] was this was a part of the father's
[56:05] drama which had not been uttered quite
[56:07] so plain as certain prophecies about
[56:11] Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph and so on
[56:14] some of them it was not necessary for
[56:16] God to conceal the mystery of what he
[56:19] was going to do but when it come to the
[56:21] Messianic prophecies it was so God would
[56:24] hide the person out
[56:26] of Christ becoming a human he would hide
[56:30] it all down through the scripture now
[56:32] God was the first one to prophesy of
[56:34] course and that was in Genesis 3 that
[56:37] there would be a serpent Bruiser and he
[56:39] had gave him the gender identification
[56:42] of being a he I hope that don't offend
[56:45] us he was a man that's right because he
[56:48] was the word and the word is in that
[56:49] person so God identified him himself
[56:53] that he would come and Bruise the
[56:54] Serpent's head and the serpent would
[56:57] bruise his again masculine gender that
[57:00] he would bruise his heel so then God
[57:04] would start letting out other things
[57:06] Deuteronomy 18:15 and then he would come
[57:09] down to judges and he would come down to
[57:10] the book of ruths and he would write the
[57:12] mystery of the Messianic power of
[57:15] redemption in the Book of Ruth but he
[57:18] would never say one thus sayith the Lord
[57:21] he would never say heay sayith the Lord
[57:24] God but he would write it in a story
[57:27] that he had been laying there for years
[57:29] and years and never completely
[57:31] understood until the coming of the Lord
[57:33] Jesus on the earth that he would take a
[57:36] gentile and marry her to Boaz a young
[57:40] woman to an old man Ancient of Days and
[57:44] in this symbol perform the act of
[57:46] kinsman redeemer now to many people that
[57:50] read the Old Testament they don't do not
[57:52] stumble them to this day still do not
[57:55] even consider the book of ruths to be
[57:57] part of the Holy Cannon of the Old
[58:00] Testament but to us it is one of the
[58:03] most precious books of the Bible now why
[58:07] is that it's because you have the
[58:10] matching piece of the father's drama or
[58:14] the composition from the Divine
[58:16] Orchestra written in your soul now you
[58:20] see for those who have that now you've
[58:22] seen it as well as I have that there are
[58:24] certain people and indiv uals and my
[58:26] goodness they never take a lesson in
[58:28] their life they never go to any formal
[58:31] training or teaching of music I'm not
[58:33] against that but yet they can pick up a
[58:35] Guitar they can pick up a harmonica they
[58:37] can pick up anything and just play it
[58:40] and you say oh my goodness where did you
[58:42] go to school well school what are you
[58:44] talking about school they never had a
[58:45] lesson in their life look at some of our
[58:47] musicians here at the church M most of
[58:49] these brothers if you would show them a
[58:51] treble Cass they wouldn't know where to
[58:53] eat it or they wouldn't know what to do
[58:54] with it if you show them some of that
[58:57] stuff about music but we got some very
[58:59] talented musicians and singers do we not
[59:02] and most of them like myself they
[59:04] couldn't read one note of music now we
[59:06] have people here who can read it and I'm
[59:08] not against that but you know there's
[59:10] such a difference in those that are
[59:12] gifted in the sense that God gave them I
[59:15] couldn't play a guitar I couldn't do
[59:17] nothing going to the little Holiness
[59:19] Church that I went to and they said they
[59:21] needed a guitar player so you know what
[59:23] they done they got me up on the platform
[59:25] and they laid hands on me and they asked
[59:28] God to give me the ability to play the
[59:30] guitar my mama showed me c g and e on a
[59:34] guitar and from there it went well my
[59:37] brother Harry never took a lesson
[59:38] brother Larry lots of these other
[59:40] brothers are the same never took a
[59:42] lesson sisters as well and yet you
[59:44] realize why because they were born with
[59:47] the music in them and there are great
[59:51] talented musicians that are world renown
[59:54] but if you would take their sheet music
[59:57] from in front of them they would not be
[59:59] able to play anything now I'm not down
[1:00:02] on those type of people but it seems
[1:00:05] they're missing something from within
[1:00:08] that links them to the composition of
[1:00:11] Music which cannot be read now listen to
[1:00:14] me if who knows exactly what the end
[1:00:17] time will be they may confiscate our
[1:00:19] Bibles they may try to take away our
[1:00:21] message tapes it may come to a spot in
[1:00:24] our nation who knows uh the you know the
[1:00:26] way that the left is leaning and all the
[1:00:28] things that they're doing I was just
[1:00:30] told just this week that in our
[1:00:31] neighboring country uh that they're
[1:00:34] going trying to pass a law that for
[1:00:37] anyone who goes to try to tamper with
[1:00:39] the gender of a child a parent will be
[1:00:42] sent to prison for 5 years for trying to
[1:00:45] talk their child out of being perverted
[1:00:48] that is lesbian or homosexual if a
[1:00:51] minister will minister to them and try
[1:00:54] to rehabilitate them a preacher can be
[1:00:57] thrown in jail for two years well think
[1:01:00] about it now that's just north of us so
[1:01:02] who knows exactly where it's going to
[1:01:04] come to uh before us but I don't care if
[1:01:06] they shut us down if they take our
[1:01:09] bibles if they take our tapes we already
[1:01:12] have it written inside of our
[1:01:15] hearts it may come to a spot that we
[1:01:17] have to quit streaming our services we
[1:01:20] already have folks that stream anyway
[1:01:22] that just stream to pick what I say well
[1:01:25] I welcome you today too I know who you
[1:01:27] are and I know that you stream just to
[1:01:30] pick and you stream to find anything in
[1:01:33] the service that you can find well
[1:01:35] you'll probably find it since I'm not an
[1:01:37] angel or since I'm not a lord God I'm
[1:01:40] just a human doing the best that I can
[1:01:43] but because of that there are people
[1:01:45] that will pick and this and that it may
[1:01:47] come to a spot that the brothers around
[1:01:50] the message will no longer be able to
[1:01:51] stream their services because they will
[1:01:54] be looking for this and look looking for
[1:01:56] that and looking for something else in
[1:01:58] order to get us in trouble with the law
[1:02:02] now this is the type of people believe
[1:02:03] it or not friends we are going through a
[1:02:06] religious persecution I hope you
[1:02:08] understand we've looked about it we've
[1:02:10] talked about it for years and years and
[1:02:12] who is doing a lot of it former message
[1:02:15] people that sat right Among Us they are
[1:02:17] under an anointing of a religious
[1:02:20] persecution you going to preach with me
[1:02:23] but you know what that tells me brother
[1:02:25] Dar and I talking about before I come
[1:02:26] out that tells me that the bride is
[1:02:29] closer to the image of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:32] than maybe we've been thinking because
[1:02:34] remember he not only walked on water
[1:02:37] raised the dead heal the sick cast out
[1:02:39] Devils but he was persecuted like no one
[1:02:42] else they sent people to his meetings so
[1:02:46] that they might be able to catch him in
[1:02:49] his words according to the Book of Mark
[1:02:52] according to the Book of Luke lawyers
[1:02:54] came tempting him to be able to set
[1:02:57] traps for him in his words and we have
[1:03:00] the same thing repeating again today but
[1:03:03] of course it's only happening among who
[1:03:06] the real people of God Amen I wonder if
[1:03:10] the bride's not getting closer to that
[1:03:12] image my we want Miracles we want
[1:03:15] Supernatural I don't want to just bear
[1:03:17] that image of the Lord Jesus I want to
[1:03:19] bear that image of one that is hated
[1:03:23] that is run down that is come on
[1:03:27] that is part of being the Bride of Jesus
[1:03:30] Christ he was the most hated individual
[1:03:33] that had ever been on the earth and you
[1:03:35] want to get out of here without being
[1:03:36] despised it ain't going to happen notice
[1:03:39] Isaiah says again in verse 10 it please
[1:03:41] the Lord to bruise him he has put him to
[1:03:45] grief when thou shalt make his soul an
[1:03:49] offering for sin he shall see his SE now
[1:03:53] not his soul only but also his body his
[1:03:57] whole human nature his blood his Spirit
[1:04:00] the Divine person that was made in the
[1:04:03] form of a human being so to make
[1:04:05] atonement and bring experation for our
[1:04:08] sins notice in Matthew 26:38 whenever
[1:04:11] Jesus has went out in the garden to pray
[1:04:14] he says unto them my soul is exceeding
[1:04:19] sorrowful now no doubt his body was
[1:04:22] feeling pain already he he was feeling
[1:04:25] Agony but it was not just in his body or
[1:04:28] in his Spirit but in the Lord Jesus Soul
[1:04:32] he was starting to feel this exceeding
[1:04:35] sorrow my soul is exceeding sorrowful
[1:04:39] even unto death nobody else could ever
[1:04:41] say it quite this way Terry ye here and
[1:04:45] watch with me now notice in Hebrews
[1:04:48] chapter 9:13 for the blood of bulls and
[1:04:51] of goats and Ashes of AD heer sprinkling
[1:04:53] the uncan Sanctified to the p pu ifying
[1:04:56] of the flesh how much more shall the
[1:04:58] blood of Christ who through notice the
[1:05:02] eternal spirit offered himself without
[1:05:07] spot to God so through the eternal
[1:05:11] spirit he offered himself now himself
[1:05:15] himself of course is the union of Soul
[1:05:18] spirit and body now he offers himself in
[1:05:22] a vicarious position standing for you
[1:05:24] and I he would be able to pay the price
[1:05:28] in order to redeem us I'm not talking
[1:05:29] about just being saved I'm talking about
[1:05:32] the bride being saved Sanctified filled
[1:05:34] with the Holy Ghost having the very life
[1:05:37] of the Lamb of God himself living inside
[1:05:39] of us notice says who through the
[1:05:42] eternal spirit offered himself without
[1:05:45] spot to God Purge your conscience from
[1:05:49] dead Works to serve the Living God so
[1:05:52] Christ offered up himself freely
[1:05:55] voluntar ly and gave everything about
[1:05:58] him not only his Humanity but his
[1:06:00] divinity as well notice Ephesians 51 be
[1:06:04] therefore followers of God as dear
[1:06:06] children and walk in love as Christ also
[1:06:09] ha loved us and hasth given himself for
[1:06:13] us as an offering and a sacrifice to God
[1:06:17] for a sweet smelling savior so we were
[1:06:20] lost we were stinking as it was we were
[1:06:23] wretched out of the presence of God
[1:06:26] but the Lord God made a way through the
[1:06:28] perpetuation of the Lamb that the lamb
[1:06:31] could come and his blood would cleanse
[1:06:33] us his soul would be released and
[1:06:37] actually allow us to receive a part of
[1:06:40] his soul and then our bodies will be
[1:06:43] changed at the end time to be like un
[1:06:46] his own glorious body 1 John 2:2 and he
[1:06:50] is the perpetuation for our sins and not
[1:06:53] ours only but also for the sins of the
[1:06:56] whole world 1 John 4:10 herein is love
[1:07:00] not that we loved
[1:07:04] God your love of being a Christian has
[1:07:07] nothing to do with you choosing God
[1:07:11] first you loving God God loved you
[1:07:14] before you ever
[1:07:16] existed he chose you before the
[1:07:19] foundation the work and wrote your name
[1:07:22] on the Lamb's Book of
[1:07:24] Life thank you Lord oh thank God you're
[1:07:26] in his love not that we love God but
[1:07:30] that he loved us and send his son which
[1:07:34] is the word made manifest in the human
[1:07:36] body to be the
[1:07:38] perpetuation of our sins now notice in
[1:07:41] Isaiah also holds a mystery here which
[1:07:44] was part of the hebreas looking the way
[1:07:47] the Hebrews would look at hristic was
[1:07:49] the way that they embraced the hebrewism
[1:07:51] and one of the two things that they
[1:07:53] looked at as far as a blessing of God
[1:07:56] was Generations one of the greatest
[1:07:58] things that a man could live to see was
[1:08:01] not only his children but his children's
[1:08:04] children so if a man live long enough to
[1:08:07] see his children and his children's
[1:08:10] children and his children's children
[1:08:12] that man was considered to be so blessed
[1:08:15] by God in the way the Hebrews looked at
[1:08:18] it as longevity of life was a great
[1:08:21] blessing so then having long life was a
[1:08:24] tremendous bless in also having seed yet
[1:08:28] the Lord Jesus chose not to be married
[1:08:32] he chose not to be a married man in the
[1:08:35] natural but Isaiah prophesied he would
[1:08:38] have
[1:08:39] seed how was that possible if he's not
[1:08:42] going to be
[1:08:43] married unless of course his seed will
[1:08:46] come another
[1:08:48] way
[1:08:49] Glory notice he says yet it pleased the
[1:08:52] Lord to bruise him he has put him to
[1:08:54] grief when thou shalt make his soul an
[1:08:56] offering for sin he shall see his seed
[1:09:00] so now here Isaiah taking that hebrewism
[1:09:03] and applying it over to the Lord Jesus
[1:09:05] only in a glorified form that the
[1:09:08] blessing of the spirit would be so upon
[1:09:11] him that he would actually see his seed
[1:09:15] well how words is he going to see his
[1:09:16] seed he'd never even married a woman
[1:09:18] when he was here but this is part of the
[1:09:20] blessing of God which will carry over
[1:09:23] not only from the Hebrew view of looking
[1:09:25] at but over into the Messianic Kingdom
[1:09:28] in the Millennium and also in eternity
[1:09:31] in the eth day notice he shall see his
[1:09:34] seed so the highest regard of the
[1:09:37] blessing given to what can't you see why
[1:09:39] that Abraham now in our modern society
[1:09:41] in the Western World you know if a man
[1:09:43] does not he doesn't have the ability to
[1:09:45] father children there's something wrong
[1:09:46] with him or his wife cannot bear
[1:09:48] children my it's a burden for many of
[1:09:50] them and they pray and they pray and
[1:09:52] even as sad as it is for us it's nothing
[1:09:55] like it was for them because for them it
[1:09:58] was part of your part of your blessing
[1:10:00] part of your posterity so for the Lord
[1:10:03] Jesus to not leave a generation coming
[1:10:07] to the Earth with their view now this is
[1:10:09] why Abraham so rejoiced that he was
[1:10:11] finally going to have a son and then his
[1:10:14] son had a son and his son had sons and
[1:10:16] on down it was the greatest height of
[1:10:18] the blessing of God on their life and
[1:10:21] yet the Lord Jesus is going to come to
[1:10:23] the Earth as the seed of of Abraham he's
[1:10:26] not going to be married not going to
[1:10:28] have a wife and he's going to have
[1:10:31] seed amen
[1:10:35] wow oh my notice Isaiah
[1:10:38] 538 he was taken from prison and from
[1:10:42] judgment who shall
[1:10:45] declare his
[1:10:47] generation so there's going to be a
[1:10:49] generation of
[1:10:51] Christ amen Jesus's amen
[1:10:55] [Music]
[1:10:59] who shall
[1:11:00] declare his
[1:11:05] generation every day you live a Godly
[1:11:08] life you're declaring
[1:11:11] it now look friends many of us the older
[1:11:14] we get the more we look like our mama or
[1:11:16] our daddy or whatever more you know how
[1:11:18] that goes depends on whether you like
[1:11:19] the way they look whether or not you're
[1:11:21] proud of it I guess or you look like
[1:11:22] your Uncle Fred or you look like so and
[1:11:24] so and so and there just something about
[1:11:26] her maybe you got little ways that you
[1:11:28] do you know brother Homer Arnold always
[1:11:30] had certain things that he did and a
[1:11:32] certain smile about him I was privileged
[1:11:34] several years ago to get around one of
[1:11:35] his brothers I mean it it startled me
[1:11:37] when I got around him because he looked
[1:11:40] so much like him and certain things that
[1:11:42] he done thought oh my goodness this is
[1:11:44] unbelievable he he was so much like him
[1:11:47] but what was it was a strin that that
[1:11:49] run in that family you know it was just
[1:11:51] like oh my and so is it in a Divine
[1:11:54] strange in the family of God now brother
[1:11:58] Homer Honor's brother those of you that
[1:12:00] knew our brother what a precious brother
[1:12:02] he was if you'd never even know his
[1:12:04] brother's name but if you knew brother H
[1:12:07] Homer and you'd get around that man You'
[1:12:09] look and say I know I've seen you before

[1:13:11] and a reproach On Me by identifying me
[1:13:13] with Malachi for that's one of the
[1:13:15] greatest compliments after being saved
[1:13:17] and being filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:13:19] that you can do you want to brandish my
[1:13:21] name around the world and try to make me
[1:13:23] feel humiliated because of it my name's
[1:13:25] done been around the world and I

[1:13:30] identified with Luke 17:30 Revelation 10

[1:13:40] the message that's going to get us out
[1:13:42] of
[1:13:43] [Applause]
[1:13:45] here
[1:13:47] hallelujah who shall declare his
[1:13:51] generation a question amen for he was
[1:13:56] cut
[1:13:59] off out of the land of the
[1:14:02] living now watch him approach
[1:14:05] approaching this in the form of a
[1:14:07] question of a consecutive generation of
[1:14:11] a paternal
[1:14:13] parent who will declare his generation
[1:14:16] he was cut off before he was able to get
[1:14:22] married who will be be his need how will
[1:14:26] he ever have

[1:14:48] God he had no
[1:14:50] life or so they saw
[1:14:55] he had no
[1:14:57] seed so that's all he had no
[1:15:00] generation he was cut off in the land of
[1:15:04] the living but the cutting off made the
[1:15:08] way for the
[1:15:09] multiplication of his
[1:15:12] seat had he lived you and I could not B
[1:15:15] here to this day had he come to the
[1:15:17] Earth and healed the sick and walked on
[1:15:19] water and raised the dead and lived here
[1:15:20] for three years or 30 years or 3,000
[1:15:23] years and never gave his life and went
[1:15:25] back to Heaven would still be lost today
[1:15:27] but because he chose the oh my The
[1:15:30] Narrow Path he chose a harder way the
[1:15:33] way of death Hallelujah that's my Lord
[1:15:37] that's my conquering Master because he
[1:15:39] chose that way he made a way for you and
[1:15:42] I to sit here today and be Redeemed by
[1:15:45] the power of the Holy Ghost to have our

[1:20:39] captain of their
[1:20:41] salvation
[1:20:43] perfect through
[1:20:46] sufferings verse 11 for both he the
[1:20:49] sanctifies and they who are
[1:20:53] Sanctified are all
[1:20:56] all of
[1:20:59] One his seed his
[1:21:04] generation for which cause he is not
[1:21:09] ashamed to call them
[1:21:15] Brethren now imagine some of my
[1:21:19] siblings they might be a little bit
[1:21:21] ashamed that folks know Donnie Reagan's
[1:21:23] her brother
[1:21:25] that might be quite risky I don't know
[1:21:28] some of my family down in Kentucky they
[1:21:30] might not be very proud of
[1:21:33] me but as long as Jesus
[1:21:36] is I'm so glad that the Lord Jesus can
[1:21:40] come over and put his arm around me
[1:21:41] brother down and say how you doing
[1:21:47] bub glory to God you imagine to be
[1:21:51] servants to be a servant is more than I
[1:21:54] deserve
[1:21:55] but that he would call us brothers
[1:21:59] sisters in his economy not slaves not
[1:22:03] servant bow down before me I'll crack
[1:22:05] the whip no the family the family don't
[1:22:09] you see why Satan don't want you to see
[1:22:11] who you are don't you see why he tries
[1:22:14] to keep it away from you this is the way
[1:22:16] he sees you this is the way the Lord
[1:22:19] Jesus sees you he's not ashamed of you
[1:22:28] notice this in verse 12 saying I will
[1:22:31] declare thy
[1:22:33] name unto my
[1:22:35] brethren in the midst of the church will
[1:22:39] I sing praise unto thee and again I will
[1:22:44] put my trust in him and again behold I
[1:22:49] and the
[1:22:51] children which God has given
[1:22:55] me amen but he wasn't
[1:22:59] married he was cut
[1:23:04] off you kill an ordinary man he'll never
[1:23:07] be able to father children again you
[1:23:10] kill the God man you give him
[1:23:12] the you give him the opportunity needed
[1:23:16] to cause a child
[1:23:18] explosion wo Hallelujah you give him the
[1:23:22] needed opportunity for the s life to
[1:23:25] pour out of that corn of wheat which was
[1:23:27] the soul which allowed the very life of
[1:23:31] God to come out and regenerate
[1:23:33] regenerate regenerate regenerate it's
[1:23:36] still regenerating to this very day
[1:23:39] Satan has tried to burn it he's tried to
[1:23:41] stomp it out he tried to crucify he'll
[1:23:44] never do it why because his generation
[1:23:48] will be declared to the last seeds
[1:23:50] brought in
[1:24:01] behold
[1:24:02] I and the
[1:24:05] children which
[1:24:07] God has given
[1:24:11] me for as much then as the children are
[1:24:14] partakers of Flesh and
[1:24:16] Blood he also himself
[1:24:19] likewise took part of the
[1:24:22] same that through death
[1:24:25] he might destroy him wake up
[1:24:29] devil listen what's fixing to happen to
[1:24:31] you old
[1:24:33] boy destroy him that had the power of
[1:24:36] death that is the
[1:24:39] devil don't you understand why he's
[1:24:42] raging like never before he knows his
[1:24:44] time is short at hand church folks
[1:24:47] sitting around asleep a lot of folks
[1:24:48] sitting around asleep but the devil
[1:24:49] ain't asleep that's why he's fighting
[1:24:51] with everything he's got
[1:24:55] so what does the new birth do to
[1:25:00] us what this the prophet said they
[1:25:02] become a new creature you're a new
[1:25:05] nature they're they're a new being a new
[1:25:08] creature that the Greek word says a new
[1:25:11] creation it's a new creation you've been
[1:25:15] recreated again from what you were to
[1:25:19] the image of a Son of God or a daughter
[1:25:20] of God it's just an all
[1:25:25] it's the greatest
[1:25:27] miracle that ever happened when a sinner
[1:25:31] can be made to
[1:25:34] become a
[1:25:38] Christian praise be to
[1:25:41] God I wonder if we shouldn't get up
[1:25:44] every day and thank God we are the
[1:25:46] greatest Miracle one of them that God
[1:25:47] ever
[1:25:48] did or you just say well I'm saved well
[1:25:51] I'm saved there's no way in the world
[1:25:52] this Revelation is Shing our hearts like
[1:25:54] it ought to we would not go around
[1:25:56] brother Louis with our chin hanging down
[1:25:58] around our bootstraps we would not go
[1:26:01] around but so down and so defeated all
[1:26:03] time you are the greatest miracle that
[1:26:05] has ever been in God's creation for God
[1:26:07] to take you a sinner man a sinner woman
[1:26:10] lost as we would say on your way to hell
[1:26:13] as we would say and God transforms you
[1:26:15] and actually oh my changes your whole
[1:26:17] being takes that old nature out and puts
[1:26:20] in part of his own divine nature and
[1:26:23] sets you to
[1:26:25] music glory be to God and your oh
[1:26:28] Hallelujah your life your steps your
[1:26:30] talk your speech your behavior what is
[1:26:32] it doing it's playing out the Divine
[1:26:34] Symphony Of
[1:26:35] [Applause]
[1:26:41] God watch's this in question answers
[1:26:45] please explain the
[1:26:47] difference between the
[1:26:50] spirit and the
[1:26:53] Soul what well now that's a hard one he
[1:26:59] says the first thing you are a Triune
[1:27:04] being just like
[1:27:06] Father
[1:27:08] Son and Holy
[1:27:11] Ghost
[1:27:12] oh so you're a triing being so when God
[1:27:15] made man in his own image he was talking
[1:27:18] about not
[1:27:19] images as in two men took jesus' nose
[1:27:23] took the father's ears took Jesus hands
[1:27:24] and the father's lips the spirit only
[1:27:27] has one image and that's Jesus but when
[1:27:30] he made man in his own image it involved
[1:27:34] the mystery of what God was that he was
[1:27:38] the invisible the great spirit but he
[1:27:40] had a visibility about himself which was
[1:27:42] the condenscending form which at that
[1:27:44] time was not Jesus but it was the
[1:27:48] word and then God would condense in in
[1:27:50] order how many has the spirit of God in
[1:27:52] you today you have the SP of
[1:27:55] God so does that mean there's all these
[1:27:57] different versions of the Holy
[1:28:00] Ghost well now do you have if if if if'
[1:28:03] God now it's just one
[1:28:05] person if I've got him all the rest of
[1:28:08] y'all is
[1:28:09] deceived you ain't got God you just
[1:28:12] think you got God if God's only one
[1:28:14] person can only live in one house cuz I
[1:28:16] know I got it if name of one person in
[1:28:19] the going to the rapure out of Happy
[1:28:21] Valley you're looking at
[1:28:22] him and y'all ought to feel exactly the
[1:28:25] same way you say sorry brother Donnie it
[1:28:27] ain't you it's
[1:28:28] [Applause]
[1:28:30] me but God had a condescended form in
[1:28:34] spirit form which is holy spirit or Son
[1:28:38] of God down through the church ages not
[1:28:39] the physical body now so you can have
[1:28:42] him you can have him you can have him he
[1:28:43] can be dwelling all over the Earth today
[1:28:46] in the Tabernacles of humanity and it
[1:28:48] doesn't weaken his presence one bit in
[1:28:52] heaven what is it a condensation of the
[1:28:55] father again in spirit form Jesus was
[1:28:58] the condensation of the father in human
[1:29:01] form the holy SP the holy spirit is the
[1:29:05] condenscending form of that Eternal God
[1:29:08] and a multiaspect body that he can live
[1:29:12] all over the world at the same time
[1:29:14] Hallelujah and them scattered thousands
[1:29:17] of miles
[1:29:20] apart notice he says father son Holy
[1:29:23] Ghost is three titles to one person
[1:29:26] which is Jesus Christ and you're soul
[1:29:30] body and spirit but it takes those three
[1:29:34] to make you which is one of them you're
[1:29:36] not you it takes the three to make you
[1:29:40] now watch skipp on down a little bit in
[1:29:42] this and he said the soul is the nature
[1:29:45] of that Spirit then when the Holy Spirit
[1:29:47] comes upon you it does not do nothing it
[1:29:50] changes or
[1:29:52] converts your
[1:29:54] Spirit to a different
[1:29:57] soul
[1:29:59] lord and that soul is a different nature
[1:30:04] that's on that spirit so the soul is the
[1:30:07] nature of your spirit first you were
[1:30:11] mean and evil and
[1:30:15] hatred where's where's drinking and
[1:30:19] smoking
[1:30:21] and it's amazing to me friends how folks
[1:30:24] limit
[1:30:25] worldliness to drinking and smoking and
[1:30:27] running around and they can be as mean
[1:30:29] as I don't know what meanness is an
[1:30:32] attribute of the devil hatred is an
[1:30:34] attribute of the devil notice how he
[1:30:36] talks about that we're converted what
[1:30:38] we're converted from Evil hatred Mal
[1:30:40] stri now you're loving sweet kind see
[1:30:45] the difference it's your nature well
[1:30:48] I'll call it
[1:30:49] that it's your soul that's been changed
[1:30:55] amen ladies and gentlemen due to the
[1:30:57] power of this next quote we invite you
[1:30:59] to buckle up your seat belt bend over
[1:31:02] and put your head between your legs and
[1:31:04] get ready for a fast
[1:31:07] takeoff the old
[1:31:09] soul
[1:31:13] Di and the new Soul which is the new
[1:31:16] nature Was
[1:31:18] Born Into You
[1:31:29] Paul said the same thing except he used
[1:31:31] the terms old man new
[1:31:35] man notice again you must be born again
[1:31:37] so in order if you're born again you got
[1:31:39] a new parent then you got a new nature
[1:31:42] the old Nature's dead and you got a new
[1:31:45] nature you once was going one way now
[1:31:47] you're going another way you was once
[1:31:48] going this way down now you're going
[1:31:50] this way up your affection are set on
[1:31:53] things above new affection you don't
[1:31:55] love the things of the world no more
[1:31:56] you're affections of God a new nature a
[1:32:00] new being a new creation nature of your
[1:32:04] father and you believe and love every
[1:32:07] word that he
[1:32:11] said amen Every Man's word is a lie
[1:32:14] contrary to his word and this is God's
[1:32:15] word say the Bible that's right I don't
[1:32:17] care what the church says the Bible's
[1:32:19] still right to you cause your Nature has
[1:32:23] been
[1:32:29] changed you see even when you were a
[1:32:33] little
[1:32:34] boy or a little
[1:32:37] girl there was something in you that was
[1:32:43] different I'm thinking right now of a
[1:32:47] great
[1:32:50] violinist from Indiana from the United
[1:32:53] States in the state of
[1:32:55] Indiana this music was born in
[1:32:59] him yet nothing like it was in his
[1:33:01] parents or
[1:33:03] grandparents but they would go to his
[1:33:05] room and find him taking rubber
[1:33:08] bands and stretching a rubber band from
[1:33:11] one dresser drawer to another and
[1:33:14] plucking on that rubber band and pulling
[1:33:17] the drawer out and it would expand the
[1:33:20] tension on the rubber band and change
[1:33:22] the tone
[1:33:24] or the key of the rubber
[1:33:27] band now brother Jeremy don't you go
[1:33:29] home and play the rubber bands
[1:33:31] this now where did he get that he had
[1:33:35] not gone to school yet where didd he get
[1:33:38] it the music was born in if you ever
[1:33:41] heard him play you can see it you can
[1:33:43] hear
[1:33:45] it hallelujah amen when you were a
[1:33:49] little boy or a little girl there was
[1:33:51] something in you then
[1:33:54] [Music]
[1:33:54] [Applause]
[1:33:56] yes I might inject a little bit of
[1:33:59] Doctrine here if you don't believe it
[1:34:00] it's quite all right I
[1:34:02] do I believe that when you was a little
[1:34:05] boy a little girl there was a seed
[1:34:06] placed inside of you he
[1:34:09] said God rich in Mercy 1965 you want the
[1:34:12] page paragraph date you want the
[1:34:14] auditorium name he preached
[1:34:16] in there was a little something inside
[1:34:19] of you seemed like it didn't bother
[1:34:20] other kids but there was something
[1:34:22] inside of you
[1:34:24] Oh Glory to God what was it oh you
[1:34:26] didn't know how to stretch the rubber
[1:34:28] band you didn't know how to find your
[1:34:29] way to God and you run around and done
[1:34:31] this and that and the other but God said
[1:34:33] That's my boy that's my girl right there
[1:34:35] she's not playing my music now she
[1:34:37] bopping her head and dancing to the
[1:34:39] devil but after a while I'm going to get
[1:34:41] a hold of her Hallelujah after a while
[1:34:44] I'm going to get a hold of my boy and
[1:34:46] I'm going to set his feet on the right
[1:34:48] path he's going to walk down the bars of
[1:34:50] the music he's going to March down
[1:34:52] through that praise God
[1:34:54] he's going to do what I want him to do
[1:34:56] he's going to say what I want him to say
[1:34:58] That's my boy that's my girl that's my
[1:35:02] daughter that's my son they belong to
[1:35:06] [Applause]
[1:35:16] me you know what we all started out
[1:35:19] with the first first notes of her
[1:35:23] redeemed
[1:35:33] life sing
[1:35:37] gra God save me God forgive me God help
[1:35:43] me what was happening just finding your
[1:35:45] place in the bars between the
[1:35:49] music what was your first notes
[1:35:52] repentance repentance and be baptized
[1:35:55] what were you doing following the Sheep
[1:35:56] music of Acts
[1:35:59] 238 oh glory to God it might have been
[1:36:03] 10 years from the time you repented till
[1:36:05] you found the right water baptism but
[1:36:07] you finally found it or may I say it
[1:36:10] found you you went down and titles you
[1:36:12] was baptized in the Baptist Church and
[1:36:14] the Church of God in the Presbyterian
[1:36:16] and one day you got baptized into the
[1:36:19] name of the Lord Jesus
[1:36:22] Christ Hallelujah God setting you right
[1:36:25] in line with your part of the
[1:36:40] composition we're just born a
[1:36:42] Christian by the power of the
[1:36:44] resurrection of Jesus Christ we are
[1:36:47] Christians by
[1:36:49] birth that makes us new creatures in our
[1:36:53] old
[1:36:54] nature we could
[1:36:57] never be
[1:36:58] Christians you see this is the way that
[1:37:00] many folks believe and preach Redemption
[1:37:03] and salvation they're preaching it's
[1:37:05] that old man you get it that old man and
[1:37:07] God kind of washes him down and scraps
[1:37:09] him over the little bit of coox and you
[1:37:10] know just slaps him around a little bit
[1:37:12] hits him and pulls him out of there
[1:37:13] praise God he's brand new no no he dies
[1:37:18] [Applause]
[1:37:24] that's the reason today we have so many
[1:37:26] calling themselves Christians and live
[1:37:29] any kind of
[1:37:31] Life they've never experienced that born
[1:37:33] again that's something that changes you
[1:37:36] and takes that life
[1:37:39] out like pulling the blood out of a man
[1:37:42] that's got a certain type of blood and
[1:37:43] putting another type in him it's pulling
[1:37:46] the life out of the man and injecting
[1:37:48] the Life of Christ in The Believer and
[1:37:51] then he becomes a new creation
[1:37:54] amen Romans 6:6 knowing this that our
[1:37:58] old
[1:37:59] man is crucified with him that the body
[1:38:03] of sin might be
[1:38:06] destroyed that henceforth we should not
[1:38:12] serve don't you understand the
[1:38:13] difference between a Christian making
[1:38:16] mistakes and your life as a sinner in
[1:38:19] Sin Sin was your master that's right but
[1:38:25] once you get converted you changed
[1:38:30] ownership you're not your own you belong
[1:38:32] to him you've got another Master but
[1:38:35] brother Donnie will I make mistakes
[1:38:37] every day of your
[1:38:38] life till your Humanity has
[1:38:41] changed but you are not serving sin you
[1:38:45] hate sin you despise sin and Satan lays
[1:38:48] a snare for you and catches you in your
[1:38:50] weak time and you have to say oh Lord
[1:38:51] please forgive me I didn't mean to say
[1:38:53] that that Lord I didn't mean to do that
[1:38:54] I fell short of your glory why because
[1:38:56] sin's no longer your
[1:39:00] [Applause]
[1:39:02] master by the old man what is it very
[1:39:04] same thing the prophet said used a
[1:39:06] different term it is the corruption of
[1:39:09] our first
[1:39:11] nature and it rolled
[1:39:13] us dominated
[1:39:16] us it told us to drink we
[1:39:21] drink it told us to act like an idiot we
[1:39:23] acted like an
[1:39:26] idiot we smoked we took somebody else's
[1:39:29] wife somebody else's
[1:39:33] husband we made fun of the people of
[1:39:37] God Paul said he blph
[1:39:41] ignorantly come on now what is it the
[1:39:44] poison left from the original serpent
[1:39:49] bite
[1:39:54] the Venom of a toxic Fallen nature was
[1:39:59] injected into the human race after the
[1:40:03] bite of the
[1:40:06] serpent but God says I will produce the
[1:40:09] seed which will kill that
[1:40:17] night brother so let the devil call up
[1:40:22] let him say I'll do this and I'll do
[1:40:24] that but we can look at old Copperhead
[1:40:27] right back in the face and say you ain't
[1:40:28] got no
[1:40:31] teeth you ain't got no poison on me you
[1:40:34] ain't got no hold on me because I done
[1:40:37] got injected with another injection and
[1:40:40] it ain't serpent in them Hallelujah the
[1:40:43] Lord Jesus didn't give me a little
[1:40:44] antidote to kind of help me every now
[1:40:46] and then well you know I can't keep from
[1:40:48] saying I got to go out and run around on
[1:40:49] my wife I got to do this that and other
[1:40:51] oh no he didn't give me a little
[1:40:53] antidote that would help me till the
[1:40:54] next time he'd give me an absolute cure
[1:40:57] that took the Venom the Venom of the
[1:41:00] serpent by out of my soul and said here
[1:41:03] Donnie here's a complete new
[1:41:06] [Applause]
[1:41:16] nature cuz if God only patched up the
[1:41:19] old one the serpent Fang marks
[1:41:23] still be in
[1:41:31] me man we're just now getting to the
[1:41:33] good
[1:41:36] part knowing this that our old man is
[1:41:41] crucified that the body of sin you see
[1:41:43] sin is conceived as a living
[1:41:48] power Paul addresses it as if though
[1:41:51] it's an organism
[1:41:53] a living
[1:41:55] instrumentality don't you understand why
[1:41:57] people cannot quit
[1:42:00] sinning this is actually a reality in
[1:42:04] Sinners not only in Sinners but those
[1:42:07] that are saved and some of them even
[1:42:09] Sanctified that's why they don't have
[1:42:10] the power to quit doing stuff they can
[1:42:13] quit it for a week or two or a month or
[1:42:15] three and they go right back to it again

[1:54:09] the family in Heaven and Earth will be
[1:54:11] called by that same
[1:54:13] name but the Jews thought he'll have no
[1:54:15] children he'll have no
[1:54:17] children but on the day of Pentecost the
[1:54:19] devil thought he's got kids
[1:54:24] he's got kids oh

[1:54:30] the wife she was HD in him
