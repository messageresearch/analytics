blindly autoseal but because he ordained in the electus he chose us we had nothing to do with it he said he saw we needed he placed our names there rather than just why shouldn't everybody just love the Lord just just you know brother man said it's it's it's it's good to be in church he said it's a joy to be in church under any circumstances I can only think of one circumstance it wouldn't be a joy to be there that's when I have to preach but I told Alice I said I believe I'll just stay home and stream tonight she said no that won't work so I'm just so happy to be here I'm just I am so thankful be a Christian brother sisters I hope you just see it on my face every time I come to service it's you know I've been here 11 12 years whatever like that it's just it's it's it's in here it's it's just not up here it's not because daddy spent $2,200 to to straighten my teeth that's because I got something down here thank God for that let's look in the scripture if you will tonight to Colossians chapter 1 verse 25 through 27 while you stand him thank you brother Louie I've kind of started a little a series and I've been trying to get out of it but I can't but I partly did tonight I've been studying on four five six eight weeks I guess on this particular thought and Monday night the Lord really gave me the the specific direction to go with this thought it's kind of being you Israel the bride dizzle the bride you know Israel's journey type surprise journey and we looked at several things a lot of Israel's Wars and 144,000 different things and when we when we talk about Israel and we're not going to talk about sorry brothers we're just not going to get much in Israel because I had I've got five pages of things that's happening to Israel that I want to bring to you but if I brought that I can't really bring Christ the mystery of God revealed to you so I'm just gonna have to I'm gonna have to just lay that aside but we'll touch on a little bit but when we actually talk about Israel it's not just history but really it's modern events made clear by history by prophecy but when you think about what a miracle is for Israel to be restored you have you have you have Syria you've got every nation around Israel is its Arab and their whole purpose is destroy Israel from Egypt they got the ban radiancy don'want on see on one side is are there only really border of protection but whether it be all the other bordering nations they want it they want to destroy Israel that'd be like they'll be like Tennessee you know with North Carolina and Virginia and Kentucky they're all against Tennessee I think that's the way it is really if everybody hates Israel it's a miracle that they're even a nation but it's really scripture fulfilled I mean you know when you're looking like I was the other prophet he said I was their 2760 Israel shall blossom and bud and fill the face with the earth with fruit that's that's fulfilled and I was at 35 won the wilderness and the solitary place that's dryness and drought and desert she'll be glad for them and the desert place that's the lower part than they gave desert shall blossom like a rose that's fulfilled that's modern events made clear by prophecy I love just history but that's but Israel being a nation the one thing to see Israel being restored but what about the bride tree being restored that's the greater Rose of Sharon that I see the bride tree is being restored in this last day let's look in Colossians chapter 1 now this is of course the text that brother Graham took in Christ the mystery of God revealed and we're going to look at that a little bit tonight if the Lord will help us Colossians 1:25 Paul speaking wherefore I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the Word of God even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to the who Saints not everybody the Saints 127 to whom also again not everybody to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory is Christ in you not Christ around you not Christ over you Christ in you the hope of glory let's pray Lord Jesus father such a glorious subject that message Christ the mystery of God revealed is one of the most tremendous messages the prophet has ever preached they're all tremendous the Lord I've just thankful for it's you give us understanding helped us Lord it's all by your election the Lord but we we desire after we got saved I know that the Bible teaches us that no man can this can seek God God seeks his own but once we are saved and filled with the Holy Ghost and our whole desire is to seek God it's altogether been changed I pray this you don't know what your server tonight get me out of the way and North the people to hear the words already known to give us understanding and leadership tonight we'd be careful to praise your we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and everybody says amen you can be seated in the name of the Lord I want to talk if I could give it up title I want to continue a little bit with blessings in the homeland but if I give a subtitle I want to talk about the secret Kingdom the secret Kingdom I don't get all the secret we're going to get some dark mysterious secret kingdom well we will but when you think of that when we when you see where I'm going and just a little while you see where I'm going oh I'm just just I'm just happy to be here now this word mystery to whom God will make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery this word is a very interesting word mystery it's not not even mentioned in the Old Testament at all it's actually mentioned 26 times in the New Testament 24 of those 26 times not just this interesting is if you look it up in the in fatik dialog the word mystery is always used the word secret so it's only 26 times in the New Testament mystery is even used and each of those 26 with exception of two actually in the original Greek it's used the word secret so when we talk about the mystery of God were talking about the secret of God so it's almost interchangeable well it is interchangeable and so Jesus in mark 4:11 the first time it was actually the first time the word mystery is used in the Bible Jesus himself spoke it and that's the only time he ever used the word three times the word mystery which is actually the word secret and Mark 411 Jesus was explaining the parable of the of the sower he said that Jesus said unto them unto you it is given to know the secret the mystery unto you not everybody unto you the mystery of the kingdom of God but unto them now that you and they a mural within them's without but them that are without all things are done in parables and that's still yet in parables today because they don't understand it and that's and if you look it up in the emphatic dialogue says the same thing and he said it to them to you it is given this secret of the kingdom of God but to those without all things are given in parables now as I said to use this word three times no so what is the mystery of mysteries a secret and what is a secret we'll get that in just a minute but as you say well if you tell me what a secret is and it won't be a secret any longer well it isn't it isn't if I when we see the definition now how you say well is God just by by holding secrets or only giving his secrets out to certain people you say gods Justin what does he sovereign he does what he wants do you say well is it fair well is it fair when God said I loved Jacob hate Esau is it fair that God could bring - but that he actually could bring two million out of the bondage of the land of Egypt key bring him out you know and because of their unbelief they're lost all the old-timers 2 million of them brother man said not a one of them except for Josh when Kayla made it in yet he brought in the book of Jude said he saved him out and yet had to destroy him is that was that fair with God you can't say anything is unfair with God because he saw what he does what he wants - now this word mystery actually comes from a Greek word mysterion which means to shut the mouth to shut the man now I don't want to get off on that look at this word as the Greek lexicon mystery it's a hidden thing a secret a mystery generally mysterious religious secrets confided only to the initiated guess who's the initiated into the kingdom and not to ordinary mortals I'm just reading what they said a hidden or secret thing not obvious to understanding a hidden purpose or counsel with God the secret counsels which govern God is dealing with the righteous which are hidden from ungodly and wicked men but playing to the godly I see predestination written all over that definition wrote all over it now I'm going to make a mysterious statement here I'm going to prove it as we go on what was in the back part of God's mind before the foundation of the world you the bride the elected the chosen you are the fulfillment of what he had in the back part of his mind I want to make a Presbyterian shout right now that all doesn't make up everything if they if they had the understanding if they had the ears to hear and eyes to see but as brother Ben said in crisis and mystery I'll give you just a little let's just start with this paragraph one or two now God secret mystery we're talking about a secret Kenan go back in I trusted I challenged everyone go back and listen across the mystery again and again and again God's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of God's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed in that wonderful we we think well Genesis 1:1 in the beginning but we had a prophet in issue in race it could take us back say before the beginning we never know nothing what was only after the beginning but what about before the beginning I'm just so thankful that we were given in you know and and as it's coming up through the body coming up through Luther Westland the Pentecost and the tongue age and I age and the seer in the prophet but the last faculty brother man said was the intelligence which is Christ himself Christ himself now in Christ revealing his own word paragraph 77 notice what he says see down through the age we started off from the foundation from the first church age when the seed went into the ground the complete seed then it come out and the feet Luther come out through Wesley then to the Pentecost of the tongues in the lips now it's the eyes prophetic of Malachi 4 and so forth and now there's nothing else left and too many people stop right there they stop right there but you don't stop right there and now there's nothing else left for it to come but him himself to step into that he himself because that's the last thing no one that brother Ram could say justification made way for sanctification Saints vacation Baden way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for what the Holy Ghost himself gotta realize what age we're living in is the person of Christ no wonder Iike that revelation 10 when I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow over his head remember the other natural of course time for this visual Israel you know focus on a natural land the bride is focused on a spiritual land is a restored type sobriety restored oh look at this parallel as we go a little farther as we said in our first quote now God's secret mystery had before the world began now back in the back part of God's mind there's something that is trying it was going to achieve now this is this is the last generation before the rapture God has taken six thousand years to achieve that has he done it well if he hadn't done it now he's not going to get it done because it's over it's about finished this is time for going up this is this is harvest time maturity time bride time after time if he hadn't done it when is he gonna do it pray tell me clusters 126 even the secret the mystery which God hid from ages and from generations but now made manifest to his saints in Revelation ten seven so familiar but in the days of the most of the seventh angel when he should begin to sound the mystery the secret should be finished I know but man says many times and it's true you know all the mysteries will be revealed but it doesn't say which they were but it's really talked about the mystery of God there is a mystery of God that's why I singular in revelations 10 seven the mystery of God should be finished or brought to maturity brother I'm sure we don't really understand the favor that we've been hearing in this generation the inside and the understanding and the revelations of the vision and the book being opened and receipts in our name in that book and all the wonderful things that we see what God has let us see in this generation well if we could just catch a hold of that what we're we really staying why we were given who we are how wonderful it is we'd want to have church ever and I said god I just thank you I praise you that's world is going to forgive me is going to hell in a handbasket I hate to say it but it's weird this this the world has gone as shot has gone but what he's done for us is just so wonderful being called and chosen being quick and justified spiritual ear excellent resurrected so realizing the secret of God should be finished in this day oh brother now look at notice in Revelation 3 7 they say because Val says I'm rich increase in goods and have need of nothing but I'm saying to you that you're rested miserable naked poor blind and don't know it so they thought they they thought they was in 1 Kingdom but actually they were in another Kingdom and you know the devil always always wants to mimic what God does he can't create but he can only pervert or mimic so why did that angel tribute by the band in the 10th vision for always trying to explain that second pool he said it only calls carnal impersonations he said I told you not to do that he explained it all the time because brother Brown loved the people who won't explain it but he said don't do it he said now this third pool said nobody won't know nothing about that I'll meet you in there he said you can't teach the Pentecostal baby supernational things they it's not for them it's not their age yet their age is over people want information but what they needs revelation I mean hey you you you we can rally around this message because of many things we because the book the prompt you can love the Prophet you can fall in love with information you can fall in love with the prosperity you can fall in love with the the leadership around the message you can follow there's a lot of things you can fall in love with but that's not what he Everton he told us he said you got to fall in love with Christ the whole thing is Christ Christ alone that's all it's about I don't care what they say it's all about Christ you go back in the Old Testament we'd be Moses disciples we'd be Moses and that's all they said the fairs where Moses disciple what did Moses say he spoke of me I'm Christ he's the one who spoke of me if you as Moses disciples You Know Who I am if you're if your brother Brown's disciple you know who Christ is he spoke of Christ he led his surprise he said I must decrease that he must increase that John said I must decrease and he must increase brother man said the same thing I've got to go off the scene so he could come forgive me I'm not gonna be able to bring this about Israel but I found so I am I am going to read this I actually typed it out I'm gonna read you maybe two three years down the road we'll get to it I don't know modern is wrong this what they said about modern Israel has become very secret let's put this up there I'm going to read this the addiction to secrets in modern Israel is a modern Israeli thing perhaps a result of the fact that after 2000 years of Exile the Jews finally have their own secret service underground hidden weapons and that the country is surrounded by nations dedicated to its destruction even for those who have no professional need to know of these matters there's a sense of security and knowing some secret and pride and telling the neighbors that your son is doing things in his national service quote that he can't even tell me about there's a radiance remember Israel the bride Israel the bride Israel Debray everyone I want everyone wants Oh secrets to remain secrets but everyone wants to be seen to be knowing something about them your net worth as an Israeli as measured by your secrets but of course secrets are the most volatile currency on the market so keep them secret the country is simply too small and crowded and filled with bases and secret units and weapons for you not to know and the longer you live and work in Israel the Israelis you know you yourself become part of the secret Kingdom Wow when I saw that I thought I've just pulled a lot off you yourself become a part of the secret Kingdom Israelis collect and squirrel away these little bits of information and only give them away to those who are also part of the Charmed Circle [Applause] hello charm circle hello charm circle to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but those that are out is still in parables can we go a little farther some things you just don't tell you know brother may I just say one time you said try not to know too much I'm talking about worldly information worldly gossip worldly this worldly that that's why I said pray for revelation you know I have to pray for information pray for Revelation you'll get plenty information Oh Lord for 4,000 years you had natural king to natural kington and brother Don he's just I mean he just got through on Wednesday night he said and I've been sitting on this earth for weeks I said okay Donnie just go ahead and preach it just go ahead and preach my sermon bill I just go ahead but he laid a good foundation John Kay preached it came preaching the kingdom of God as the ham John Pat baptized the king of this kingdom which was the second mercy seat the first one that was behind the veil second mercy seat was in Christ about three years later they kill the king temporarily corsa no resurrected but and his body raised up of God sent down the kingdom place the spiritual Kingdom in the heart of man the third emergency in the heart of man now since the new kingdom cometh not with others without observation or not with observation rather a ruler in Israel named Nicodemus he wanted to know how do you get in this kingdom how do you get in this kingdom you say it's not going to be a natural kingdom you got to be born of ordered blood and the spirit how do you get into this kingdom you telling us about so you see the whole thing is a mystery and that's why I said to use this word mysteries not even in the Old Testament in the old tent that wasn't needed in the Old Testament so only need it when this new kingdom is being set up now don't miss this now the very first time this word as I said the very first time Jesus himself used the word mystery the first time he's ever spoken in the New Testament and he said mark 4:11 and he said unto them unto you and I read this reading it unto you is given the mystery of the secret of the kingdom of God but unto them that are without all these things are done in parables now again in Christ the mystery God this great secret has always blinded the wisdom of the world his secret his mystery did blinded you know the preaching of the gospel opens the eyes of some blinds others it's not for them and that's why you know we want to witness everybody but it's not for them you know if you're led to it but don't just spread it out there do it you got to be led God's great secret is always blind to the wisdom of the world they can't get it they just don't understand it Satan don't understand did you hear what I said Satan don't understand it you think you've Satan really knew that Jesus Christ was the Messiah and was the Redeemer of the world war you think he would have killed him not on your life he didn't know it he didn't know so what is he is he is he the one is he not I don't know easy it's a different kind of it they didn't know it say that did not know that I thought he would have never killed him Satan don't understand it none of the rest of them understand it but those who are predestinated to understand it look what was once God's great secret great mysterious secret in his mind is now put in the hearts of the believers right now Christ is a mystery of God revealed that's our message that's our scriptures plushes 127 that's our soul that's our focus that's our life Christ in you the hope of glory not for them not for any other generation now what was in God's mind before the foundations of world is now in the hearts of the believer what are we talking about I'm talking about not a natural land but a spiritual land not a natural Kingdom a spiritual Kingdom and I haven't get enough spiritual Kingdom you got to have kingdom nature what look what was once God's great secret great mysterious secret in his mind it's now putting the hearts of the believer that is the body of Christ what was God's once great secret in his mind before the foundation the world is now made manifest take of it I say think of it the fulfillment of 6,000 years of God's desire and is in his purpose and what he wanted to bring to pass is now only now in this generation being made manifest he said well Luther had that Holy Ghost a portion he said he had a different to the Holy Ghost Wesley a different of the Holy Ghost pinnacles a difference to the Holy Ghost but you have the Holy Ghost saw the the Holy Ghost himself the fullness of the word that's why we talk about a person must have a word birth a word birth say when I got the Holy Ghost when I was back in pretty coasts you may have but you've got it on your spirit you can't have a word birth to tell the world it's time for this generation oh brother that's just as plain as 2 plus 2 is 4 Satan don't understand them the kingdom how do you know Jesus said except a man be born again he cannot even see or understand the kingdom of God it seems not born again so it's a don't understand the kingdom because he's not born again until you're born again you can't understand the kingdom that's why jesus jesus said it verily verily I say me except to me if you want to be a born of the water flesh you said you can't even understand the kingdom of God what we have been given oh brother Matthew 3 1 in those days Came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judea and he said now he's Johnson the forerunner of the Messiah ok he's going to full run this Messiah was just the Messiah is going to introduce his new kingdom so here's John preached in the wilderness and what does he say he says repent but it wouldn't be the dawn he'd sell out this still thought okay go ahead go ahead repent for the kingdom of God kingdom of heaven is at hand John no he was a forerunner of this month this Messiah this king but he didn't know who he was but John was given a sign and that sign was when the Spirit of God descends on him as a dove and remains brother when I forgive me for saying it again with brother Don he brought that out I was wondering you know had John the bath filled the Holy Ghost from his mother's womb you know but the Holy Ghost was given and he just kind of explained that thank God I thank God thank God for the fivefold ministry the Holy Ghost wasn't giving it up but the secret is at rest on him it remained it on him he could go on the prophets and come off could go on the prophet come on but Jesus was the first of that new creation now it remains on the individual he made a way that the Holy Ghost could remain on people not go and leave it and come and leave it but remain this was the key to the New Kingdom the Spirit of God the Holy Ghost could now remain on a person not come and go oh the first of this narration in a new new race where the new generation paving the way for the for the birth of the cry for the birth of the church rather had Pentecost now remember they still had the mindset of a natural kingdom but you know John is trying to he's trying to bridge the gap a few words that repent for the kingdom of heaven is a hand they couldn't catch the transition like in but they said you know we want a king anyhow like in the days of Saul you don't need a king but we want a king anyhow John's saying repent but we want a natural king of many hell no matter what he said we want a natural Kingdom because that's what with us all we know Moses Moses Moses Moses time went on about three years later Peter on the day opinion but well before that even Jesus they maintenance had said they couldn't catch that revelation and Jesus himself says the same thing repent time went on three years later Peter on the day of Pentecost what does he say repent John says it jesus said Peter said in acts 2:38 it must be something to it I mean if you're giving the introduction to the new kingdom and it's one word repent brother that's got to be some foundational something there that we need to catch a whole - now this is a first step in this new kingdom acts 2:38 now I ask you why is acts 2:38 hid been here for 1,900 years why does the devil hate acts 2:38 why denominations hate it they won't preach it and don't use it I'll tell you why the devil hates acts 2:38 because it's a key to the kingdom it's a key to the kingdom it's the key of the entry into this kingdom when John was introducing the King he preached repent when Peter was introducing the kingdom he preached repent it's such a simple verse for yet very few people really understand what does that mean and we've got by God's help tonight I'm gonna help you understand when Jesus was preaching the kingdom in Matthew 4:17 from that Jesus himself said the same thing from that time Jesus began to preach and say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand John preached Jesus preached it Peter preached it guess what we preach it they say well say well I repeated I told God I was sorry got baptized in water then immediately God gave me the Holy Ghost no no no no no no no no no it's not that way it's not quite that simple I'd like I wish it was just you know just God I'm sorry get baptized work got the Holy Ghost boom just like that you know why you got too much this black dog too much black dog in the way and we'll show you why we got too much black dog in the way okay too much black dog most people don't really truly repent listen to me I'm going to help some people you know you say are there people in the congregation I don't have the Holy Ghost absolutely and remember now even the foolish virgins they all claim to have the Holy Ghost they all claim to have all young people middle-aged old people this is what I'm gonna tell you is really serious stuff because the devil is going to tell you you've got the Holy Ghost when you don't have it and the devil also tell you you don't have it when you do have it so you got to know how to discern how how did how deceiving what the devil is showing or telling you or giving you a feeling or some emotion or some experience that you felt and some might not really understand acts 2:38 but with the help of God tonight we're going to understand it you must be born again paragraph 67 let's start with this one don't fail to get this quote don't fail to get this quote right here you must be bored yes to be born again you must go through a process of death everything does you take a grade of corn if a corn expects ever to live again it's got to die first if a grain of wheat ever expects to live again it's totally impossible for that coal that weed that flower that tree the grass defensible everything that expects to live again must die first then how are you going to escape it you've got to die first you've got to die die out to yourself die to everything so that you can be born again you've got to do that if you don't die you can never live again don't fail to get this quote and we're going to give you several more you've got to die he said it three times you must die well you say it simply means to change one's mind that's right you changed your mind you say well I don't want to die but you got to change your mindset yeah I do want to die well I mean nobody wants to die but you got to change your mind because yeah I don't want to die God said I got to die okay I want to die you know make it brother say oh yes I'm making sense that's why most people don't really truly repent and I mean listen now we're going to go real deep I said well I repeat it all I know how to repair ok ok let's see but they just don't want to die Jesus died for you now you must die for him not to not to not to earn salvation no all I follows the same cycle death burial resurrection death burial resurrection doesn't fail no exceptions nowhere in nature death burial resurrection John 12:24 Jesus speaking barely barely I said to you except except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit Jesus now he's saying he is the king of the kingdom he said and except except that corner we any natural grain or that grain didn't know that seen your heart same thing if it about if it don't die as in case of you it'll just stay dormant well I don't want to get ahead of myself it's gonna die as long as the seed stays in the seed package it's not going to its Dermott eyes but it can stay in that seed package for years what about the they found corn or whatever in the Garner's is either long as it stays dry it still Germa ties but until it's put in good ground you can buy some flower seeds you keeping that put them in a drawer it them seeds will do this they'll say for years there's dermatitis there's life in them but they ain't going anywhere because it's abiding alone until it's placing the good ground so it can die and rot it'll never bring forth life let's look at another one you must have going to get paragraph 73 you see what I mean now you are dead now how dare are you we're gonna find out how dead you you got to die now how dead are you going to be our souls now listen alright we're talking about the soul now because your flesh is not it's not redeemed and not redeemable until we get a new body you got one thing that can be redeemed us your soul you got ten outlets as against you see taste feel smell hear constant recent managed memory fixing your tent against you one for you the black dog you got to seem like he's a whole lot bigger but graters he this wouldn't you this is the world you see what I mean now you're dead our souls are placed upon the divine judgment that is that's brass when our souls is placed upon an altar of divine judgment what was the penalty what was the penalty when when animal was placed on the altar what was the penalty for the animal death and you and when you lay yourself upon the altar of God which is pronounced death upon the sinner how can you raise from there alive in sin if God accept if God accepted the sacrifice is it clear now you die you actually are consumed and you're petrified you know what I've been to the Petrified Forest where's it in Arizona where's Harvey Arizona I got there years ago and I've seen all them petrified trees they laid there for hundreds and hundreds a year and they've actually laid there so long they've become petrified they've become stones stones little stones you lay there so long till you die you're petrified and be yeah what a petrified piece of wood it's it's as hard as a rock your stone that's how that's how much you've got to die you've got a die tell you to become petrified you say well brother Terry how you you just wait you just see what I got it right here front on me you're petrified there's no more left to you but just this form if you're dead and petrified there's nothing else but just this form because see you got to die to yourself every principal ever desire ever focus everything that's in your heart that's got to die the flesh don't change this lesson don't change I'm in the same old rotten temple that I lived in when I was when I was a sinner 16 the old evil things I did is 16 to 18 I live in the same house he's got a new control tower this new control tower what brother Tom ain't nothing changed about this rotting flesh and yours too not one thing has changed about your body when yous out and sin not one thing same old rotten flesh but you got a new king got a new control tower you've got a new leader you've got a new headship you've got somebody telling you what to do when you tell him what to do there's no more left in you but just this form that you're standing in like the brass serpent like Christ was when he took him dead and cold off the cross you're dead because why you're on God's altar of judgment now when you come to God you just might as well know when you come to God you're on God's altar judgment if you're not willing to be that's to accept that sacrifice of Christ the Lamb he died in his flesh so that you could be redeemed of your sin you got to die to yourself you must die you're on God's altar of judgment what is his judgment when the judge has passed his sentence what is the sentence of his penalty death and when you place your soul upon that altar a judgment it's death to you now do you get it how many of us have been petrified in here I hope all of us if you're not that dead we got to get that dead you got to die until there's nothing left but to Christ let's go a little farther one unity of the God in the church paragraph 45 God's kingdom is not of this earth God's kingdom is in our hearts did you hear that they wanted a natural kingdom they didn't get it out God was trying to introduce to that my spiritual Kingdom a kingdom nature a different kind of Kingdom God's kingdom is in our hearts it's the spiritual Kingdom that we're born into jesus said the kingdom of God comes but not without violence and the kingdom of God is within you the Holy Spirit God's kingdom moving in a man and governing and control of him that's the kingdom think of a friends every every birth is a mess before a seed can actually bring for life that's he's going to die and that's he's got to rot it's got to follow to the earth the moisture the ground has got to swell it up and it's got a rot before it can explode open and bring forth life usually you got to die usually when a man dies it's a result of a lot of violence now God's asking for a spiritual suicide I don't where ever you got saved I don't know you know if you out in the cornfield at the altar you know on the workplace doesn't matter where you got saved but you got to die you're gonna die if your seat listen if your seat of God you're gonna die and if you're not willing to die yourself and commit spiritual suicide then God's going to kill you and it becomes homicide but you're going to die come on one way they're not and I'm gonna a non seat there's nothing too quick but if your seat but if you're saying you're going to die either you're going to let here you're going to die yourself and you're gonna let God kill you some come easy and some come hard which way do you want it you know I'd rather take my judgment on this side you know some people want to take it over there I won't mind a pass first I want to take my judgment right here you know either you die here or let God kill you if you're seeing which one you won't take your pick if your seat is gonna get you one way or the other but remember you said well they did forget that gives me a license to prolong it well it made but you may not be seen I wouldn't wait too long I wouldn't take a chance on it you've got to place yourself on that altar and die amen now you just take your pick now remember if your guard CDs gonna get you one way the other said he's gonna get you but listen if you've been around this message for so many years and you hadn't died yet I think we've got a problem the military don't get too personal oh I'm going I'm going on I got it right here John cried repent Jesus cried repent Peter required pride repent what does it mean change your mind turn around about-face die you were going down life's journey this way something happened you turn around you're going this way now you say you're going this way and if you really die maybe you gotta tense well you know maybe Lot's wife no no look back no if you're going to go this way you better stay that way you ain't looking back Jesus take no pleasure in them to look back call one of them you got it if you're going to go in God's kingdom you gonna keep your eyes on the mark hear me hear me tonight about face turn around that's a long time on repentance now I want to really explain acts 2:38 40.4 you it help me okay repent now be baptized we don't have to go through baptism that's pretty clear water baptism is an outward show I use worst show because that's no Hollywood it's an outward observance of an inward work you're actually showing you know brother mem said water baptism induction into a fellowship spiritual baptism induction to the kingdom you know basically it's an hour show showing you know the people that truly something's happened in my heart I got saved that's Christ in my heart he give forgive me our sins and so you're baptized but it's a commandment now and then and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and what is a gift of the Holy Ghost not tongues gift the Holy Ghost eternal life okay now now the big question is now brother Terry now the big question after I've repented after I've been baptized water how long do I have do I have to wait to get the Holy Ghost Wow what a question if anybody ever thought that young people middle-aged people people that struggle down fear do I have it doing on everybody don't have it people been around this message for years near just fell away they didn't have it preachers that preach this message for years fell away they didn't have it preachers in this preaching this pulpit before Fela wait they didn't have it might as well face effects didn't have it just that simple now how long do you have to wait but I want to ask you a question I'm going to answer your question with a question how long do I have to wait after I've repented be baptized to be filled with the Holy Ghost well I ask you this question how long does a cucumber have to stay in the acid become a pickle all brother Terry well it's one word for it's very simple that cucumber you put it in that acid it's got a state in that acid that cucumber because they in that asset one word describes it until until entail untell how many I don't know until it doesn't matter how long until the whole thing is I tell some comes quick some comes long sum comes easy comes some comes hard but you got to stay there until the whole secret is on tell now the untell really is up to you you so what about just oh it's really up to you it's really up to you I'll show you why it's up to you you said well it got dogs I'm pre dancer okay okay I know you said free dancing me too but how long how long was face the time before as many people as many many many years they got the Holy Ghost after this baptized why there's a reason you must be born again look at this one paragraph 76 now your soul is laid upon the altar of God your soul is laid upon that altar of God's brass judgment then God receives the sorts they sacrifice now it shows that you haven't received yet if it does if you're still alive in the world God never took it now we're getting on something right now I can eyes I see the the brains are beginning to roll the spiritual wheels are turning now now God never took it now you people talking about getting the Holy Ghost and how you have to wait so long here you are I told you a good right in front of me until God receives that sacrifice until it's late on his judgments there on ko list I said on tail and tail until until his judgment has actually killed your senses you might say well I'm going to turn a new page that idiot well I know I used to smoke I'm gonna quit smoking that still isn't it until God receives that sacrifice on his breath on brass altar his altar of judgment what is his judgment death death I'm saying again death gotta be willing to die everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to go by Calvary that still isn't in care of God receives that sacrifice on this brass altar his altar is judgment what is his judge - that's the penalty the soul that sinneth that remains in that shall die don't care what you've done you want a scripture Peter speak him and we are acts 5:32 and we are witnesses of these things and so is also the Holy Ghost whom God has given to them that obey Him have you fully obeyed fully obeyed I'm not saying your life is spotless we're not talking about that I'm talking about fully obeyed and repentance repentance true repent on the kingdom of God he's preaching the kingdom of God he's showing how to get in the kingdom the first thing is you got to repent then you got to know what true repentance is it brings death bring separation it brings a reversal it brings it turning around or means it brings a new desire you went that way now you're going this way about-face that's the truth that that's the truth understanding of repentance you must change you must die lay offs in church eights paragraph 360 in his own personal life continuing with his health speed of Christ he overcome by obedience to the Word of God Hebrews 5 7 says who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was awesome that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared though he were a son yet he learned the obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey Him he purchased salvation for all those that obey Him what is it what in what was he a beauty - he was obedient to the word what do you got - Beauty to the word now listen let's look at Abraham's life just a minute and we'll just see if God performed the same trial today bruh ham did for Abraham as we've got to be we've got to die we've got to be on his altar now Abraham paragraph 29 Abraham after he was called out of the land of the Chaldeans in the city of Ur he became a pilgrim a sojourner and then God called him after he had proven after he had proven after they had proven that he was going o to take God at His Word then what God did then was give him a sign that he had accepted him he gave him a sign he called him years ago but then later he gave him a sign what was a sign that he accepted him accept his faith and he circumcised him and he circumcised instrument all this household and now you see when when you are called out first you go through a trial to see if you're really gonna go on did you hear what I said I didn't write it I'm just reading it you go through a trial to see if you're really going to go home and then God and then God gives you the Holy Ghost which is the sign that he has accepted your faith that you profess to that you profess to have in him you follow me now he's going he's going to accept it he didn't get Lord help me oh Jesus let's look at the ex paragraph 31 and I see super sister gave the enemy now when we receive Christ as our Savior then if we're sincere in that did you hear that if we're sincere in that then God gives us gives us a sign that he has received our faith in Christ by giving us the seal of circumcision which is the Holy Ghost he gave Abraham the natural sign of the seal of circumcision which was in their flesh a sign that he received his faith we get a spiritual sign of circumcision which is the Holy Ghost which God has received our faith when we get the Holy Ghost and that is a sign that God has received your faith in what is your faith faith is a revelation God is saying now okay so we might come to the altar an instant in you you repent and everything well at two or three weeks later you know you just well you know that the emotion kind of wore off well God knew that when when he knew that three weeks he knew that that emotion would wear off I'm making sense tonight he knew that well what if it what what if he was truly sit I mean what if you was dead sincere I mean you know and you'd use you just literally died I mean this just don't happen too often but sometimes it does if God sees that said they're finished they're going on giving the Holy Ghost yes sir it happens but not too often why the black doll don't want to die just don't want to die especially in America too many worldly pleasures too many good well you know you can ask about any sin on street do you want to go to help no you want to go to heaven yell when you well I'm you know later on them will get saved sure that's that's yeah later on or get saved nobody wants to go to hell but the later on never comes because there's too many worldly pleasures too much too much in this world I want to do I don't really want to I don't want to serve God I've got I've got to go through my teen years since so my Wild Oats and I got to do this and I got to do that yeah you might end up hitting a telephone pole and you don't have that second chance you better do it now while you have the opportunity you ain't for you not even promised to go home tonight the Holy Ghost he's except now let's back up that e31 then if he's if you're sincere in that then God gives us a sign they'd received our faith by Christ giving us a sealed circumcision which is the Holy Ghost that's the seal of Serket grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you're sealed to the day of your Egyptian not to the next meeting but to the day of your addition that's right a piece in 430 now that's how we receive the Holy Ghost he thought about being serious in Si are you talking about how it God tested Abraham and I see let's look at paragraph II 32 and now you say oh I'm a believer and gods never give you the Holy Ghost , he's never recognized it yet you're just confessing that you believe but when all the doubt I'm not saying you're not a believer now in a certain portion you're a believer but when God has found favor you found favor with him rather and he recognizes you to be his child and he knows your heart and he sees your sincerity he knows all things are cut away from you then then then he seals you into the kingdom of God by the Holy Ghost it's right there brother it's just black and white proving to the world that he has accepted what you profess to have in him do you get it now go he says the same thing in future home said now when God accepts you says you don't accept the whole you don't accept him he accepts you because it's God's attribute God has to accept your faith God has to when you come to that point whatever it is I can't say what it is days months weeks years but whenever it comes to that point God says okay he's dead now just like just like look at Abraham okay he brings his child up to the mountain you know it's it's God's it's gonna give me a child he gave me a child but now he's telling me the killing I read he said you know he said I I know he's the promised lineage you know I know he's going to come through him but he said he's gonna kill him he's got to raise him up you know I mean he's just there all this thing to it but he still he said God said killing so I'm taking up the raises he says Abraham Abraham stop now now now I see that you really believe me now that I see God's got to give you the test we all got to be tested brother sister oh there's all different kinds of tests but when God sees that she really mean business with him that's when you get the Holy Ghost it's a secret Kingdom secret Kingdom you know he's just it's not for everybody you know let's go a little farther the cannery now we must listen you got it we must realize that I'm gonna hurry here not too much longer how deceiving this age is as I said I wish I wish I could believe it everybody in here has the Holy Ghost but rather than I'm said in every church three kinds of believers I mean you know three kinds of believers even the foolish virgin said you know I got the old I don't want think it listening I don't want to take any chances I do not want to take any chances I mean you know brother Burt if I got to die suicide or hummus I don't care how it is I want to die I mean I want to be dead I mean my whole focus is Christ it's got to be that way you know about 25 months I've been in the mess about 35 years I guess it when we first come into the message we just we just believe that you know if you could receive that brother man said you know how what's the evidence the Holy Ghost when you can receive the message of the era well that's true but receiving is more than just oh well yes your y'all see God sent a prophet a man did more than that but we used to believe you know if you understand the pools and the thunders and and you know and the the church age messengers in the seventh seal well man you know you can understand you got it we found out that wasn't through those medium could preach the seals and thunders and pools everything else it didn't have it that's why I said I said well that's why the Pentecostals just cabbage down on tongues was the initial evidence he said I don't see witches and wizards and and devils and and he there's everybody else speaking tongues and don't have no Holy Ghost no it's not you I wonder what did Jesus say SS the king of the kingdom he said by their fruits you shall know them it ain't what you it ain't what you say it's not what you ver vocalize or what you profess oh yeah well I'm a priestess I'm born again on this end yeah what kind of life do you live what's the fruit of your life listen if you want to know what kind of tree it is you go out looking you don't look at the bark of the tree that might deceive you if it's got an orange on it's an orange tree it's got pecans on its a pecan tree or living an apricot or whatever by their fruits ye shall know the devil can impersonate anything he can purr purr say anything they're kids but he can't live the life the devil cannot live the life he cannot produce that kind of fruit he can't do it well you say what will you what were you doing let me just put it this way well I shall here's what brother Bev says when you receive the Holy Ghost you may speak in tongues you may not you may shout you may not you may dance in the spirit you may not but there's one thing you will do you will bear the fruit of the Spirit and the fruit of fear is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness meekness patience temperance [Applause] you will bear the fruit of the Spirit why because what is the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the token what is the token somebody tell me what is the token it is a literal life of Jesus Christ what is the life of Jesus Christ love joy peace longsuffering temperance make this place is temperance you say you've got the Holy Ghost you don't bear the fruit of fear I doubt your experience so that's free drop from the horn that phrase this time it's been said so it's been said plenty of times from this pulpit but I'm just saying it again you will bear the fruit of the Spirit are you gonna make mistakes sure but you don't let them Harbor you don't let them linger you don't do them day after day you don't carry and you don't grudge and you know hey and you don't bitter you know ridicule and FaceTime you know you don't do that why your life is dead it's hitting Christ you bear the fruit of the Spirit you say well I brother listen brother Ram it's not our example Christ our example but what kind of life did he live how was his attitude huh what was this his countess you know you can hear him on tape you know he'd bump the pulpit oh brother I'm sorry that was my fault it's always my fault it's my fault my fault you know you know what God's priority is here here just this come fresh I know what it is but it's not on notes God first other second you say third God first other second your sale third you said well what about all these what about all these problems were having in in the church what about any of these problems around the beds and why are people leaving the message they don't have the Holy Ghost the one ordained there's no representation they don't think you know they don't have it if they if they receive that it's stay with them if he's in for 30 it's sealed in you're sealed in you sealed in you're not gonna leave it I mean hey to me you know around the message you know we've got we've got problems we've got bitter so you know people hold grudges and this and that this you know divorce and whatever more wow wow wow in the message there is no divorce I don't care who I don't care who it is I don't care I'll just say to anybody now there's divorce around the message but there's no divorce in the message you tell me have two people or truly born of the Holy Ghost with a word birth they go divorce no sir don't tell me you come too late I've been around this message too long because you got love joy peace longsuffering gentleness meekness patience forgive even when you're not wrong forgive forgive say well you know I'm not pulling anything I'm just telling you they know you know I always say can you imagine brother darling sister Carol divorcing I mean you know me that's just like oh you're joking I beat you you got the Holy Ghost you got to hold it over just I mean say look the Lord told me to say it so I'm just that's just the you must be born again let's look at this quote here and we close this second now there's no excuses he will have no eyes no eyes at all cannot in any other way no matter how great he is what his name is how big is how popular he is he cannot even understand the kingdom of God until he's born again so I ask you and I title this the secret Kingdom you can't even understand the kingdom until you're born again now how many people around the world that have a word birth percentage-wise just just a little so how many people really understand the kingdom it's a secret that's why he says unto you is given to know the secret for the mysteries but unto them that are out without this in parables are we following it's a secret kingdom but if you're ordained to see it you'll see it if you're ordained to be in it you'll be in it if you're ordained to see it you will understand it if you're ordained but before you can understand you're gonna die first before you can be part of it you're gonna die first if you want to die then get ready oh my but you will bear the fruit of this field I don't care what you didn't some things you might do you might not but you will bear the fruit of it five moments I'm close here's a focus across the ministry paragraph 395 what was once God's great secret great mysterious secret in his mind is now put in the hearts of the believer that is the body of Christ what was God's once God's once great secret in his mind before the foundation world is now manifest think of it yeah right before we close here I looked up brother man said when you receive the Holy Ghost and I just looked up when you receive the Holy Ghost what make take place so I copied down all the things that he said will happen now these are just attributes of receiving the holy ghost after you receive because this is just kind of the benefits of it I thought you'd enjoy this when you see the Holy Ghost you are a Christian when you receive the Holy Ghost you seek those things that pertain to God you when you receive the Holy Ghost every redemptive blessing belongs to you you are inside the veil you are protected from the outside plagues of Egypt each one of these days when you receive the Holy Ghost you have certain rights call for the enforcer then you then you become a witness when you receive a Holy Ghost his life his life will be manifested in you when you receive the Holy Ghost it's a finished work God has completed its panel at plan of salvation when you receive the Holy Ghost you have the token that's the literal life of Jesus Christ show us the father do more clothes and the way a Christian is when we are planted together in Christ Jesus who the exhaustible fountain of life were plenty of Christ and we just drink and drink and drink and push out everything when you become a Christian you have all these things and what else do you have everything we have need up for the earthly journey divine healing the power of God all these other things is in every individual in here that has received the baptism of the Holy Ghost for you are planted in Christ hallelujah the Holy Ghost baptism yes sir and everything you have need for of this life's journey even the rapture is right in you then hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord I don't know your praises are already hallelujah praise the Lord everything you have need for in your earthly journey is in you then when you receive the Holy Ghost why wouldn't you want to die and get the Holy Ghost well I play around why was it well I don't know I don't know I know just come up and die or die on the job or die in the cornfield I don't care where you get the Holy Ghost just get it price the mystery 397 but God's great mystery what the eternal God had as the mystery was now has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ then given right down to his church what was once in God's mind is now in the body of Christ Jesus making love to the church his bride whispering what a secret Kingdom secrets to her let's do let's stand secrets to her brothers had not told these burners out there just to his beloved bride his wife secrets to her brother aren't you good aren't you glad to be part of that you glad to be part of that secret kingdom he said well this is you know it's all this mystery it's not mysterious once you understand it but you got to die first to bring forth life it's just going to be that way oh brother sister I won't heard you sing [Applause] that that little quotation that I read to you about Israel and the secrets I have thoroughly thoroughly enjoyed my study in Israel and it's just become so so more intriguing to me the miracle it is that but then Israel is actualization it's truly a miracle and you know just okay I'll just give you one cuz he's gone you know how do you find one before David ben-gurion was the first Prime Minister Israel when they become a nation in 1948 one thing David Berg Aryan had of course the military man but one thing he had he had a tremendous gift of leadership leadership and because Israel knew that see because Israel Palestine Jerusalem had been occupied for sixteen seventeen years with all kinds of people but the last hundred years you know the Turks had it for a long time than the most recent ones before they won their independence the British had it for twenty three twenty four twenty seventy years something like that and then finally the general aladeen they released it relinquished from the British you know and so forth but the Arabs you know controlled it for years and years and years and then when the Jews come in you don't start migrating back from Poland and rushing all around the world you know and the and the Zionist movement started the turn of the century and they all begin to migrate to Israel migrate to Israel come back to Israel you know and they just the Gaza it all down there they just they run out the Arabs in the end the Jews took over well you can you can understand why the the the Palestinians they call them in the in the air people they hate the Jews they're mortal enemies I'm when they come take their city but the thing about it is that's the only the only parcel of land on the earth that's promised anybody was that was Jerusalem was promised to the Jewish people God gave it gave them that land they they rightfully own that so they're just taking back what what was taken for them destroyed in AD 70 but it was time that you know the Ezekiel 37 the dry bones you know that's the bribe it's Israel also and all these prophecies but before before and when the David beginning you know became the first Prime Minister what he did was that that they he knew that soon as they declared himself independent all these Arab nations are going to be five armies was done declare on war in
