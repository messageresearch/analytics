has moved for us this postpartum healing process has not been an easy one I've been suffering with postpartum anxiety the anxiety was so bad it was hard to function when I would close my eyes to sleep I would see demonic faces in my mind it was a tormenting anxiety that hung heavy in the atmosphere around the house I had been watching brother Tim Pruitt's message call changing the atmosphere and it spoke perfectly to where I was spiritually the enemy was fighting us so hard I told Phil that I felt like the Lord was about to move early one morning I was lying in bed and able to sleep sometime around four o'clock I felt a peaceful feeling start in my feet and gently move over me as it moved over me the darkness vanished and is and in an instant I felt like myself again in that moment I knew it was the Lord since then the heavy atmosphere around the house Has Lifted and the anxiety disappeared I'm so thankful for his beautiful touch is anything too hard for our God praise the Lord amen

that I just have to tell it and it's it's not the norm but I'm gonna tell it it's been a few months ago I shared this with Brother Louie this is K-9 friend of buyers our family don't smile but I just share with brother Lily you know he's been so special to us all the things that's going on in our lives many of you know he's been there and I know he's the gift of God and about eight months ago he's developed a tumor on his heart into him on his lung and liver and I just asked God to pray in this long story short they said six months to a year with surgery we didn't feel comfortable with that so we pressed along and it's been eight months and he's been in great he's been great God's been touching him but the the story is I last Friday night I just I wanted to plan to go up to see brother Ron it's a little bit closer sometimes if I do it on the quick moment but this is home but uh I was going to go and go in there Friday night and Duncan's going through something charities he's coming out of his mouth and my wife says let's take him to bed I said no they'll put him to sleep and I said I prayed he calmed down but he kept breathing heavy all night long all night long but that calmed down I'm speeding up with the bottom line the next morning got him up took him out to do his thing each stumble fall stumble fall and I just prayed and I prayed and wanted to leave and go to service and she took him out one more time he walked around a little bit I thought I'm going I'm going and I went in there and I said to my wife and she supports me y'all pray for her I know God's working with her but I just said honey I'm gonna go I said oh you call me if you need me she says you're four hours away and I knew what her heart meant and I walked in the other room and said Lord I'm going to serve you I'm going and I'm going take care of him let him be here when I get back and I thought let him stay longer until I get back I got back she called me on the way he started running outside and

Jesus what a privilege it is for us to be able to gather together saying and worship and praying and give testimonies hear of the great things that God is is doing before we read here I'd like to ask you to remember brother Eugene Kennedy he's in um a hospice house up in Bristol Tennessee had to take him up a couple of days ago he's certainly not not doing very good and I heard from Sister Janet this morning his mouth is got some really bad places in it it can't swallow can't eat um just inverting bad shape certainly needs the Lord to to move our brother today we believe the Lord's mindful don't we I certainly mindful I also want to thank you for praying for Erica and she had her treatment on Thursday and then the shot on Friday just done well so far thank the Lord for that just real real weak and needs needs strength there but we're just believing the Lord that he's going to move forward I know the prophet told us that whenever Jesus was here on the earth that he used remedies actually whenever the king Hezekiah was going to die the Lord sent the prophet and told him that and he prays and sends him right back around again he goes back to him again and he actually brings a pole to some figs and puts on that ball and God uses things like that Donny that's not odd it must have seen when the Lord Jesus would have spit into some dust and made it into mud and rubbed it on a Blind Man's eyes so I don't care if he spits in my face if he has chemo if he we just want to be well don't we yeah that's right we want to do what God's called us to do so let's just bow our hips together we'll pray I mean you have a need on your heart today to signify the lifting of your hand Heavenly Father we love you so much we thank you for being so mindful of us Lord Jesus we ask you today Lord that you would just help us as we've gathered together here in this place that we've uh been calling home for a little bit we're praying that you would just once again come and speak to our hearts or so needy we have so many needs father we're bringing them before you brother Eugene you see is state that he's in Lord dear God as I want to sing the other day and just broke my heart but I know that he's got a new body that's waiting for him it's wealthy and hell and a rather well rather and we know that Satan no matter what he does he cannot take us until that purpose of God is finished our brother's been through this for so many many years and we don't always understand but we know that we can trust you you saw the hands that were uplifted here today Father we pray that you'll be mindful of each one of those needs Lord God open our hearts today to your word speak to us father help us I pray that we can be able to be what you want us to be we know the darkness is pressing against us like never before Satan and all of his demons are doing everything they can to stand against the people of God and the lid has been tore off of hell but God we believe you have a people that are standing on the earth that will withstand everything Satan does we're glad to be identified with that today help us as we look into your word now father in Jesus name amen second Samuel chapter 12 verse 1. I'd like to look today at the force the fourth woman in the line of the genealogy of our Lord Jesus coming to the Earth of the five women that Matthew writes about four of them supposedly gentiles three of them in sexual misconduct hurts pains Sorrows all kinds of things that come from but it depends on what we will allow the things that we go through do to us they can shape us they can mold us they can make us better people or we can hang our head in shame you know hide from it all but myself I desire to be what the Lord wants me to be no matter what I have to go through second Samuel chapter 12 verse 1. and the Lord sent Nathan unto David and he came unto him and said unto him there were two men in one city the one rich and the other poor the rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds but the poor man had nothing say one little you land which he had bought and nourished up and it grew up together with him and with his children and it did deed of his own meat and drank of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter and there came a traveler unto the rich man and he spared to take of his own flock and of his herd to dress for the wayfaring man that was coming to him but took the poor man's lamb and dressed it for the man that was come to him you may be seated may the Lord bless his word Bathsheba is a very unique character in the genealogy of Our Lord I preached about her and David for decades but as I begin to look as I've been studying on these women I realized that there was an Avenue of bathsheba's life but I'd never looked at before and I saw things about her that was different than what I had noticed before I hope I'm and you never get to a spot to where we sank so much we know so much that God came and lightness more I've always looked at Bathsheba as being in great fault and I have flawed her because of instances of of the bats of course and David seeing her but as I begin to look into the way the scripture sets her forth I realized that she wasn't to blame in the way that I had blamed her maybe some of you can understand what I'm saying and it's amazing how that we can look at things for so long and yet all of a sudden the Lord just opens it up and it's like you're looking at an entire new thing that you've never seen before by this time it has been a little bit over a year David has hid his sin he's been sick he's been weary he's been without Joy he's lost power and his life is miserable everybody that was close to him could tell something was wrong he wasn't riding any more songs he was not pinning any Psalms his Joy was depleted he was quite miserable but yet he had not come to the spot to where that he was able to go to the source of what was causing all this stuff and fix it and God let it go and he let it go and he let it go but David was acting true to form to the most of humanity that when we get in trouble we don't always go to the source that we should go to and you if you want to get a background of kind of where David was during this time frame you can read psalms 32. and Psalms 51. and you'll see where that David was and how that he knew he was wrong and he was so missing the former time he'd had was God now at this stage in David's life he's he's a middle-aged man and David like many other great men he had reached a plateau and his walk was gone I suppose he felt like by this time he would be able to back off a little bit and he wouldn't have to do as much and he wouldn't have to be under such strain and such difficulty he'd been fighting since he was a small boy he had been dealing with giants Philistines backslidden King Saul he'd been dealing with so many things in his life but now he had entered into a place of rest a place to where that the kingdom had been established some of the tumultuous relationships among Saul's family and all of that had finally calmed down there were still things going on but yet he felt like that he had come to a spot to where he didn't necessarily have to fight like he did before you know that can be a good thing but it can also be one of the most dangerous times of your life David had not yet been willing to come out and confess his sin now this is the man but let us look at the woman by the name of Bathsheba in Chronicles it calls her bathshewa but the same woman was a common Hebrew trait that they would rename their children after they were born they would see a predominant factor in them and they would name them you know whatever whenever they were born and then they would see them as they would grow up and mature and they'd start seeing other things in them and they would rename them so apparently this had happened to her she is married to Uriah the hittite he's a mighty General in the armored Army of David her father is Ellie m her grandfather is a great man also one of David's personal counselors his name is a hisophile a histophile and also Uriah the hittite were part of David's personal bodyguard they were called the 30. the 30. they were the men that were hand-picked by David generals lieutenants counselors that were his personal bodyguard this is who the woman was identified with now with some men in her life so she we don't even know if she even knew King David personally so the story that we want to look at is a classic story of a man of great power and a woman with no rights a man of great influence a man that was known around the Civilized world at that time a great man yes indeed a great man a powerful man but he's fixing to meet a powerless woman Now by their custom not necessarily the law of God but by their custom in this time frame of their culture a king could kill anyone who refused to do what he said he had to have no scripture No quote he didn't have to have anybody to go along with it his word was law now you and I both know there's very few men that can handle that kind of power to be honest with you God never made man to have that kind of power so we don't really know as far as the story when she is beckoned by King David whether she screamed out as The Book of Leviticus said a woman is supposed to do if she's assaulted we don't know if she tried to talk him out of doing wrong were really unsure but there's one thing about the scenario that we do know David was King and he was a powerful King notice in second Samuel chapter 11 verse 1. and it came to pass after the year was expired at the time when kings go forth to battle that David sent Joanne but the Bible doesn't say it was time for joab to go out but it was time for David to go out now here's the setting then that we see which is going to lead up to something that David will never outlive the rest of his life so we see uh something in David that has now become a fault a lack a disrespect for God for his position that David is now pulling back and shirking an element of his responsibility notice how the author of Samuel writes it at the time when kings go forth to battle that David sent joab and his servants with him and all Israel and they destroyed the children of amen and besides rabban but David carried still at Jerusalem so they go out and they go to fighting and joab takes command and he steps up and David is at home at Jerusalem and while joab is fixing to lay Siege against rabba Lucifer is laying Siege against David and he will prevail quicker than Joe abwell well joab and the army is carrying out David's command David now enters into a slothful lazy type of time in his life now if you haven't been there you will be there as a Christian all Christians face this time whether you're a king a preacher a deacon a housewife all of us go through times in our life to want to see my everything is going really good and we become if we're not careful slothful lazy very Relentless to do anything and we think well it's the blessing of God not always not always is it a blessing of God we can see from the way that the scripture terms this this was not a time of Shabbat for David God never decreed this this was David's dereliction of his own Duty now notice in verse 2 and it came to pass in an evening time now this is of course written in the Mediterranean type of vernacular so it seems very strange to us but the these these people in this era they would rise at Daybreak let me give you a cycle of their day they would Arise at Daybreak and then they would have their new meal about lunch at lunch time would be around noon and then the Eventide would begin at three o'clock that would be the hottest part of the day most of their houses were built with a flat roof they didn't have the roofs that we do today so no more than 8 10 12 feet tall and they would go up on the roof because it was cooler so they would always unless they was in Wartime or emergency going on they would take a nap in the cool of the day or the heat of the day rather waiting for the day to cool off too hot to work too hot to do much so they would take a siesta so David is up on the roof now he's already negligent of his duty notice in what the Bible says that David arose from off his bed and walked upon the roof of the King's house so look what he's doing nothing nothing so he gets up off of his bed now this is a king this is a man who has great responsibility a powerful man but a powerful man needs to be a busy man because if he's not he will get in great trouble so notice he walked upon the roof of the King's house and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself now the Bible doesn't give us great detail about the woman much prior to this and it doesn't say anything in this particular verse of what the woman was actually doing how she was going about and I myself have always projected her as a seductress or a temptest one who was this type of woman but as I begin to read in the scripture what I found amazing in the last few weeks is I've been pouring over this is that not one time did the Bible ever blame Bathsheba as a matter of fact it Likens her to a lamb not an adulteress at all and God never mentions her or blames her he blames David so as I begin to look at this and I've looked at at Ruth of course as you know and we've looked at at Tamar and we've looked at Rahab and now looking at at this woman which is a different scenario altogether and I begin to realize that God took these woman women rather along with Mary and use their life their background their story their past what they come through what they went through and all of that to merge a type of the Gentile bride as a whole as if so they were a kaleidoscope of God picking a bride so some would come from reverse scarred background come with some would come from the background of all types of sexual promiscuity and others would come from the background that would be very rare but a few of them would come like Mary or there was hardly any he's saying against them at all other than just their natural birth and yet God would take from that this woman would reflect so many in this one so many and God put the whole thing together to make a picture of what his Gentile bride would actually be amen now what's this and the woman was very beautiful to look upon so here David is now just kind of lazing around and not really doing much so he peers to have entered into a time to where he's kind of slothful and just laid back taking a lot of naps as we'd say it today spent a lot of time on video games and he knew more about Netflix and he did the gospels he knew more about television and movie stars and knew more about football and you know he could tell you all the running backs and the quarterbacks and the no backs and the waybacks and all types of things like that but he didn't know too much about the Bible well priest mother died you see so David arises off of his bed and in this afternoon of idleness when he has nothing to imagine that this is the time when kings are supposed to be out to Bible and he has nothing to do there's something wrong with this scenario from the very beginning now remember this is King David this is a man after God's Own Heart this is the Giant Killer this is the dancing shouting Psalm writing David so David steps out now according to the law David of course was not supposed to take anything or lust after anything that did not belong to him now when you look and as I begin to look at the at the history of this and I found out that I actually want Bathsheba was doing while she was not taking a bath Just For Pleasure she was not taking a bath and all bubbly and soapy as like some of you sisters might like it and she had done this to be able to where the king would see her but what she was doing she was taking a Mikvah a Mikvah now she had just finished her cycle and according to the levitical law when a woman would come to this cycle she was to take a Mikvah and that was there had to be so much standing water and but there had to be water which come out of a lake or a river or even the ocean and they would take this water and mix it together with fresh water but it could not be running water but standing water and they actually wouldn't even disrobe they would not become undressed so she was dressed and this was the proper way to take amygdah sort of like whenever we get baptized in water so we are baptized with our clothes on is that right so what she was doing and this is why that God never condemned her as being a prostitute or ill-famed or anything like that and God now is going to through this Union God is going to bring some years later King Solomon and also another Son by the name of Nathan which out of this lineage will come the Messiah so you think there had to be a perfect will of God that somehow God would have joined David and Bathsheba together but it was not the way David was going to go about it oh my can you say Amen so the Mikvah then is the ritual bass designed for the Jewish right to complete where this woman would be cleansed so she's not doing it as a way of a prostitute to be able to look out for this man and see if somebody will look at her and lust after him notice sin in verse 3 and David sent and inquired after the woman so David is now he sees the woman and the Bible says she was beautiful to look upon and David sent and inquired after the woman and one said and one said it's not this Bathsheba the daughter of elium the wife of Uriah the hittite so David apparently was unaware of who the woman was but somebody told him one of his generals one of his who knows what it was but somebody told David who this was and this individual knew who she was very well but the main thing he knew was she was married and what does David do in response verse 4 and David sent Messengers and took her this is an amazing word took to take gift fetch lay hold of snatch capture to steal to be taken captive so now we have the great King David stealing a sheep oh my so now we have a different scenario about a great man I wish I didn't have to preach this I wish I never had to bring this up but I'm glad God had it written in the Bible that's one thing I love about the Bible it don't just write all the good things about the people that writes me into their faults and their failures and I appreciate a man that'll preaching myself now notice and David sent Messengers and took her and she came unto him and he lay with her for she was purified from her uncleanness and she returned unto her house now here David the mighty man the man of influence takes advantage of his position and he assurps his kingly god-given authority over a woman which has no rights no rights if she would have refused him she could have been killed oh my goodness how many men have done exactly the same thing well I'm going to preach with or without you this morning how many preachers have done such a thing and they use their position to to weigh like sisters in the church whether they were married or single or young or whatever they were and by their position fall to lower than a snake well Hallelujah what is it it's not only preachers this is why the metoo movement several years ago come to light in America because many women began to come out and testify that their boss done this or said that or did this or would promote them if they would do special favors don't sit there and look at me like you don't know what I'm talking about why is it because you can't find many real true men or women as far as that's go and the age that we're living in that can have authority over others and not use that influence for their own rotten benefit but I say shame on every one of them that does it whether it's a preacher whether it's a man in a company whether it's a CEO or whatever he is I say shame on them well praise the Lord so here David now is going to move into a very very rotten cycle of humanity now notice how that the prophet Nason it's funny the prophets how God would give them the words to say it it must have been a heartbreaking scenario that day him no doubt God gave the man a vision and it must have been so discouraging because this was the same man that God used to tell David that God would establish with him and his seed an Everlasting Covenant and now he has to go back and convey a different message but David liked the most of us had such an easy time seeing the thoughts in other people but struggled to see his own praise the lord well I preached to me and y'all just kind of bear with me as I preached to me today okay now notice how the prophet Nathan conveys this and the Lord sent Nathan unto David and he came to unto him and said unto him there were two men in one city the one rich and the the other poor so now a year has gone and David thinking maybe that he's been able to hide this and been able to get over it but yet knowing in his conscience that this thing is not right with God and God is going to bring his son to repentance now I'm not sure exactly how this sermon is going to go as a matter of fact it's taken me hours upon hours upon hours to find the direction in which way I should project this so I know the Outreach of it is going to be tremendous I know that already and I know already there's going to be lives that are going to be affected by and it will affect you and I according to how we will let it affect us I want to affect men a good way if I can learn by David's mistake so be it if you can learn by David's mistake so Beth and the church said so it must have taken direction from the spirit of God to be able to help Nason to know what to say now remember the king had power even over the prophets as far as taking their life if they so desire King David could have called when Nathan come in to start to tell this story he could have called and had him beheaded right there now he was against and not that it was according to God's law but according to the law of the land and the way they looked at it so NASA no doubt must have entered into the court of the king with great precaution yet feeling he had a message by now Nathan knew what had went on God had conveyed to him the mystery of the secret of the sin now watch the rich man had exceeding many flocks and heard now remember David's background was that he was formally a Shepherd so the spirit of God no doubt LED Nation to be able to convey a story that would catch David's attention and if you don't mind me saying it this way to get him off guard something that would let him hear the story and would be able to penetrate past the guard of himself which he still had up because of his own pride and Humanity now so the spirit of God gives Nathan a story that David's going to be able to relate to so he uses the story as a shepherd and sheep now remember David was quite the shepherd and no doubt he had risked his life many times remember when he fought the lion and when he fought the bear no doubt he had many many personal stories that he could have told so the spirit of God LED Nathan to deal with something not with a king committing adultery not by the king taking this man's wine no no no he couldn't go that way so he would have to display this story in a parable and it's amazing how that us humans are that if we will tell a story and we leave the actors nameless and how good godly people will be able to judge that story with no name attached to it and from their heart they'll look at said that ain't right I'll tell you one thing that ain't the way it should have been done but if you're to put a name on the story initially that has said something totally different I hate that about every one of us you might as well just go ahead and Nod your head or say Amen because you're just like every other stinking rotten human being so if God would have let Nathan and Nathan would have come out now I'll tell you one thing David who are you to challenge me who are you but God did not want to condemn the man to be lost he left him and he wanted to help the man to repent so you imagine when Nathan starts telling the story right from the get-go's we'd say the poor man had nothing save one little prostitute one little Harlot one little temptress that she was evil and wicked notice the way God projects Bathsheba in this parabolic form that she was actually a you lamb now David's attention no doubt he'd heard about it all of his life how that Shepherds would do this and Shepherds would do that and they would sneak the Lambs and they'd they'd tell the owner well this one got killed and buried this one and David himself was out there in the field and I knew they lied they'd saw that lamb so anything to do with lambs and sheep boy it got his attention but the Torah man had nothing save one little you lamb which he had brought bought rather I am nourished up so the poor man I remember David's a rich man and he was hearing this in a two-fold manner from his background of being a Shepherd but also being a king which is to help bring Justice to the poor of his kingdom as well as the rich so the words from the prophet are exactly precise what God wants to do is open David's Soul past David's flesh and get it open just long enough where the Prophet can insert the sword why to kill him to annihilate him to destroy him to bring him to repentance I'm so glad that's our father now remember he still is leaving the story without names so the one you lamb is Bathsheba I'm the poor man of course is Uriah and the rich man is David but you see the story sometimes has more power if you leave the names out sort of like us you know if it's your son or your daughter or your best friend then we render one judgment and if it's just a story in general but our righteousness will raise up let that man die glory to God let this happen and that happen mmm long as it's nameless people oh we're so righteous do you understand the Bible tells us to have respect of persons is sin when we were rendered judgment differently because it's a different person under the same scenario we have sinned just like if you'd smoked a cigarette drunk a bottle of beer come on now God help us now what's even the adjectives that the prophet uses because he Likens Bathsheba to a you lamb a young lamb now I don't know if you know this or not but the Jewish history says that Uriah was an older man and he had several children by another woman but Bathsheba was a young woman now watch the adjectives of the Prophet so this poor man how do you lamb a young beautiful wife a convert to Judaism and so much that she was taking the midva being converted from being a gentile so he has this young wife now notice the prophet says he bought her which of course the way they did it was they would give them a dowry they would have to give the father so much for the daughter depending on her beauty and depending on whether she's educated or not so if you had a beautiful woman you had to pay a lot if she had you know a little bit of book learning how to tell a lot more I guess you'd look for a lot of dumb ugly ones in that day wouldn't you been on how fat your pocketbook it was but now this was their dowry so watch now the prophet is laying it out in such a beautiful description you see once we look back at this it makes so much sense how beautiful it is after I begin to read this I wonder if I ever read this before have I ever read this before so he nourished this you lamb up look at the words he uses he nourished her up as his own flesh which is the way husbands should do their wives now watch what he's doing on purpose Nason is showing such a love between this poor man in this new lamb so the lamb is not just a you know it's not just an animal it's not just a piece of property to this man but it's actually a part of his family he nourished this land now I don't know if you're aware of this or not but unlike Us in the modern day they did not have dogs and cats in their houses as a matter of fact to them a dog was one of the lowest animals on the Earth but they would have pet Lambs uh-huh pet lambs and other farm animals and some of them would actually feed them from their table they'd never have a dog or a cat now I'm not against you if you got one it's up to you but I'm just telling you the way it was in their time so what's Nathan how he takes this scenario and he says it grew up together with him and notice how he includes his children and with his children so now he meets this beautiful young woman and she becomes his wife and then she is also growing up and he loved her so much and watch how Nathan sets it forth that she was not an animal she was not a piece of property why is he say that because that's the way David treated her she was nothing more than a piece of Flesh to satisfy his lust but that's not the way Uriah looked at her to your eyes she was this precious wonderful thing that God had given him bless Lord God it did eat of his own meat and drink of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was unto him a daughter now notice all of these adjectives that he's using is the expression of Love That Uriah had for Bathsheba each adjective is making David worse and worse as far as his pitch and fervor of anger you imagine him saying that dog I cannot believe a man would do something like that what in the world and Nathan is describing him so David is a thief David is a sheep stealer and by this time the parable is given he's also a murderer now David killed thousands remember the song the daughters of Israel sang to David Saul has killed his hundreds but David his thousands and his tens of thousands and I hope you don't misunderstand me but as far as We Know by scriptural account he'd never murdered anyone which is not the same thing as killing the enemy of God then you're doing it God's bidding if you look it up in the Ten Commandments when it says Thou shalt kill and Chase the Hebrew word it is Thou shalt do no murder the same God that said Thou shalt not kill is the same God to tell kill the amorites kill the Hittites kill the Philistines is that right but there's a great difference in killing to defense and in murder and this was premeditated murder King David or you can still enjoy the book of Psalms after this you can still enjoy the songs and all the things that God did it ought to make you appreciate them even more than you've ever appreciated oh my God so here his affections were so endeared to this this woman so whatever that he had is shared with her and she was part of his house and they just loved her so much now what's Nathan as he moves to verse 4. and there came a traveler unto the rich man and he spared to take of his own flock so the traveler that came what was it David's passion gave its lust anointed by the devil so the traveler came and he knocked on David's door you see this is the way sin does it will come as a guest but remain as a master unless you open the door and boot him out there came a traveler unto the rich man and spared to take his own flock and of his own hurt so watch him now as he brings us together and he makes it like a scenario and that day would have been and it was of their custom you know the Bedouins even today the Arabs it's one of the greatest attributes that they have among themselves that if they see someone walking or or a stranger coming through hospitality is something that they do it's it's part of their custom and part of who they are so here he takes the common scenario of that day and he sets it for us that a stranger come through and he invited him into the house and and instead of him taking one of his own Lambs one of his own sheep what he does he goes to the house of this one poor man and only has this one sheep and this one sheep is not one among ten thousand it's not one among 500. it's the only one he has and he kills that sheep and he feeds that sheep to his Passions to his lusts praise the Lord but talk here's this word again fetch snare steal so now we have David the thief and what did David steal a sheep isn't it strange that God would liken a man's wife to being a sheep so now King David is a thief and a murderer well I think y'all are required to subscribe this morning but he took the poor man's land and dressed it for the man that was come to him now notice again in the parable that God addresses David as the aggressor David as the trespasser God would never I can't believe I hadn't seen this before God would have never identified Bathsheba as a you lamb as innocent had she been a temptress you understand so King David takes this lamb and feeds this passion this lust he doesn't love her he doesn't love this woman so he sends her back home oh my goodness but you see by the time Nason comes David the Sheep stealer is now David the murderer second Samuel chapter 11 verse 14 and it came to pass in the morning that David wrote a letter to joab I'll save your time you can read it when you get time you remember how that he tried to get Uriah to go into his wife and he wouldn't do it she'd remember all of that that David wrote a letter to joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah now in this letter he's going to tell him what to do to get Uriah killed and Uriah carries that letter himself this man is a general of yours if you know the background of for for them to even live close enough this man was a gentile or hittite which according to history for this man to live this close to the House of David that he could have looked out on the top of his roof and see his house he had to do many great feats for David and for the Kingdom of Israel his house was a gift from King David so close he could see it into his house this man that may have even risked his own life for David and he gives him a message he's packing his own death's warrant but he was so loyal to David he would have never dared to broke the seal on that letter and read it he was more loyal than David was at this time in David's life a gentile was more reputable than the king of Israel he wrote in the letter saying set ye Uriah in the Forefront of the hottest battle and retire ye from him that he may be smitten and die and this man sticks this in his pocket and hands it over to joab and goes about his merry way not realizing his King has just betrayed him and he came to pass on joab observed the city that he assigned Uriah a place where he knew that Valiant men were and the men of the city went out and fought with joab and there fell some of the people of the Servants of David and Uriah the hittite died also And yet when David hears this about this rich man he gets so angry he gets so mad why the parable had no names so let's go back to the parable in verse 5. and David's anger was greatly kindled against the man that he didn't know who it was hey man and he said to Nathan as the Lord left us the man that hath done this thing shall surely die now let's just be honest and Frank with each other this would not have been his judgment had it been his name that introduced the parable that would have been one excuse after another well it's my wife's fault which one yeah to 300. well it was this in thought nothing's fault and that and done this and this and done that that's the way human beings are we're a sorry law didn't we Amazing Grace how sweet to sound God but still love us in spite of all the trash about us oh my so David passed judgment not realizing of all the blindness that we as human beings can have it's that which makes us blind and our family and our closest friends foreign just holds his piece and lets David go ahead and pronounce the judgment and he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and because he had no pity all you see the sermon was a success the mind can be one hundredth of one percent as successful as Nathan's was that day it'll be of great success today where did he get this ideology of pity where did this come in the scenario because the man loved it fed it from his table drank from his cup all these words it was opening up David's Spirit it was opening up David's inner man so the prophet could say what what he's fixing to say the sword must enter his that is righteous indignation he's open now he's very vulnerable but now the prophet has got him exactly where he wants him he won't be that long he's only got a little while just like I have with you only got a little while to be able to reach inside of there and be able to penetrate deep down into the soul now David is actually quoting the law Exodus 22 1 if a man shall steal an ox or a sheep and kill it and sell it he shall restore five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep we love that quote did he and what about the sixth commandment and what about the seventh he brought Thor of the ten maybe when I get done we should all make our chair an older call isn't it amazing how we can judge others and be so harsh and judge and we break four Commandments here and three Commandments there and two over here and remember what come out of his mouth this man shall pay fourfold so the son that is born of David and Bathsheba number one am not number two I don't know John number three Absalom no wonder the Bible tells us judge not and you shall not be judged he still doesn't know who the rich man is he doesn't recognize that you land The Traveler but look in verse 7. he's open he's vulnerable Now's the Time in sir insert Nathan said to David thou art the man thus saith the Lord God of Israel I Anointed The King over Israel and I deliver thee out of the hand of Saul God goes on to tell him I gave it on Master's house thy Master's wives into thy bosom and gave that the house of Israel and of Judah and if that had been too little I would have moored over have given unto this such and such things I gave you all that but if that wasn't enough I would have even done more if you needed it if you wanted it wherefore hast thou despise the Commandment of the Lord to do evil in thy thou Hast killed Uriah the hittite with the sword now wait a minute David wasn't there on the battlefield was he but God said it as if though David himself had killed him you see whenever we run down one another and ruin one another's influence we just killed our brother or our sister we might as well just took a knife and stabbed right in their back and you see this tends to follow with this type of scenario I remember several years ago I was in another country at a convention that I was preaching and the pastor that was holding the convention introduced me to this man and that man a lot of men I did not know of course and he introduced me to this particular individual he said brother Donnie this is an associate of our church I said oh okay nice to meet you brother that night as I was preaching I was speaking about Satan and how he stole the angels from God at the beginning you've heard me preaching on Satan's ambition and for whatever reason I just turned and the man was setting right here to my right and I said it would be something like this brother that he goes to the local church here and he he gets tired of being an associate so he wants to start his own church and I just liken that to Satan well sometime after that this man contacts me and he tells me that he and some of the people of that assembly are fixing to divide this church they've done got a building this is like a week or two before it's fixing to happen and I I wondered why in the world is he telling me this course I've tried to talk him out of it because I knew the brother knew there was no reason at all for him to do it I pondered over it I thought about it I prayed about it I I thought Lord what do I do do I do I tell this brother he was a friend of mine do I tell him do I let it go I don't want to be a meddler I don't want to be a troublemaker or nothing like that so I've got this real close friend that stands about this tall and got real dark hair and dark eyes and pulls no punches so I called him on the phone now unlike some of you that when you got saved you found out you knew everything in the message and you don't need no help from nobody I'm I'm not that way I'm kind of ignorant dumb sort of a guy and I need help about every day just getting up out of bed you know so I called brother Tim and I said brother Tim let me tell you this situation I find myself in a quandary I don't know what to do and he said well I'll tell you one thing uh oh boy here we go if brother Daryl or any of the preachers at your church was going to do that to you I would let you know about it and you are obligated to call that brother I said okay so I call thy brother I wasn't scared about the Tim I just wanted to make sure I was right I called the brother that was the pastor talked a little bit made Small Talk how you doing doing good how is church doing good I said How's brother so-and-so Oh Brother Don he's doing so good he's been such a blessing to us he's this that the other and then I had to tell him the bad news I said brother I hate with all of my heart to be the bearer of bad news to you but this Sunday they're going to do thus and soul and thus and so and thus and so now that was bad okay it was bad but what happened even worse to us this brother entered into a stage of being a murderer because he started fighting this preacher and other preachers you see this man had an ambition um yeah David had an ambition and it wasn't always Godly would somebody at least breathe out y'all are getting me nervous I'm afraid you're all going to pass out at one time there you go ah intake there you go that makes me feel better they said what killed all them people at one time is that guy's sermon he wiped out the whole church how'd that all happened well we've done code blue on all of them and the autopsy said every one of them died of a heart attack that was sad for what was even more sad the man that caused that scenario backslid got away from God other people led away from God and because of his sin to this day you see us the people of God were not in this by herself you may think oh nobody I have no influence over anybody don't you believe that if it ain't nobody more than your wife and your sons or your daughters we are a body friends and we need one another like never before so David the harpist the singer the shelter the Giant Killer becomes Saint killer becomes a murderer a sheep Thief Steeler does it really make any difference to God whether you steal money or sheep or oxen somebody else's car some of you would never steal somebody else's car but you're jealous of this and that and the other so you still favor you're still something that don't belong I would rather have favor in the eyes of five people god-given favor than to have favor in the eyes of five thousand and have to steal it by conniving lies and deceit so now I'm going to put the Judgment in your lap what should we do with this King should we tar and feather him should we kill the man I know some of you have been treated terrible some of you have been treated awful by preachers it takes the grace of God for some of you still believe in Preachers but just because one has done you wrong don't mean that there's not some left on the earth that is still God's servants I guarantee you that I could say this without exaggeration I've been treated worse by preachers than all of you all put together and brother Branham could say without exaggeration he'd been treated worse by preachers than I have been and he still believed in Preachers as a matter of fact he hoped that God would make both of his boys preachers because to him there could have been no higher call so Bathsheba maybe you've been hurt someone took advantage of you and hurt you what do you do with it let me just give you a little preview of what we'll continue on with Lord Buddha next week she's the only one in the Bible of the Queens that was given the title of Queen she was the only one in the Bible coming up like this that was given thrown Sheba well I can't tell you I can't wait till next week as a matter of fact they say proverbs 31. you don't want proverbs 31 is we'll read it after church who can find the virtuous woman the Jewish historians say Solomon wrote that as an epitome King Lemuel is what he calls himself he refers to his mother over and over again she could have felt sorry for herself she could had all types of you know grudges and this and that and the other but instead of doing that she let God take his mercy and rewrite her life she was innocent she was innocent spell our heads together oh the Lord God Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ I commit this service the sermon this word and these people into your care this visible audience and the invisible and there'll be many thousands no doubt that we'll hear it so if there's a David about to make a horrible mistake may you stop him maybe there's a David that's made that horrible mistake already and he's daling living with the condemnation of it worried that he's crossed the line and can't get back maybe there's a Bathsheba that has been trespassed against by a man of power a man of authority she feels like her life is worthless Lord God whatever wherever we are today help us Jesus your Prophet taught us well power apart from character is satanic Lord we realize that many men in this message have so abused their position Lord God I wish I wasn't privy to all that I know that has happened around this message over the years by preachers I wish in one way Lord I could have been left alone just stayed down in Kentucky and nobody knew me I wish I would have never had to been brought to the position that I'm in I wish I could have been left down there but that wasn't your will so help me Lord ignorance is bliss as we say how many of us no doubt wish we wouldn't know this and know that and know the other but father we pray today that you would help us then Lord God we not only pray that you would forgive us oh Jesus but we ask that you would help us not to wrong others help us father when we judge matters to be very careful help us Lord that no matter whose name is attached to a scenario may we not render a different judgment because if it's a family member or a loved one or a friend may we render the exact same judgment no matter who it is because the word is always right oh Jesus may you Hallelujah may you insert your sword as it were if we need to be cleansed to be washed to be cut loose from something maybe it's something that we hold in our hearts maybe some have been so trespassed against Lord they don't want to trust nobody may you bring healing to them today Father Lord God we bring our lives before you we commit them into your care I know Lord many of these people have been hurt by preachers have been let down by them they hold every preacher even me at arm's length as we would say because they've been hurt so deeply it's like they can never trust again the Lord Jesus I pray you would help us that we can love again trust again Hallelujah able to have confidence again Lord some don't just need healing in their body they need healing in their spirit imagine that woman at the well must have been one difficult woman to ever reach she'd been so abused by men so taken advantage of by men same as Rahab The Prostitute turned out on the street by her parents to make a living selling her body must have been so hard for her to trust another man and yet here come a preacher with the message of the hour and there was such an overwhelming force from her soul that helped her to believe that message she found herself being healed of trust she trusted them men so much she hid them she risked her own life to hide them on the roof of her house Lord Jesus help us to love again help us to trust again help us to forgive oh Jesus I'm speaking from experience myself today Lord I thank you for helping me Lord Jesus I've been hurt since a child start being hurt by preachers and I was just a boy as many of these have but I thank you today Lord I can still Trust I can forgive these people don't realize what a miracle is standing before them the Lord my worst greatest hurt has been by preachers preachers that you trust once you have confidence in ones that you believe or stand with you during the hard times and when the hard times come come they turn their back and go the other way but I'm so grateful today Lord that you helped me I still believe in Preachers I still believe in sheep because the second next category that's hurt me though what most has been sheep sheep that you cry for you pray for you give them their life you give them a portion of your life every time you preach they rob you of your sleep they rob you of your family time they rob you of all kinds of things in your life then they get tired of you and they turn and walk away and don't even have the common courtesy to come and talk to you they treat you lower than they would their dog or their house cat they don't even have enough respect to come and talk to you but I'm so grateful today Lord I still believe in sheep and our love for sheep help me Jesus help these people Jesus help the ones in Africa that'll hear this the ones in Canada the ones in Europe Lord God in the name of Jesus if there's a sheep stealer they don't hear this deal with his heart if there's a money Thief or whatever kind of thief it is help them to realize as long as they got breasts they got hope it might be easy for us to condemn the thief but Lord I believe there's Mercy for the thief that's what the message from Nathan was about he's talking to the thief himself Lord Jesus help us not only to reach out to the injured but the injurer help us not only to reach out to those who've been hurt but The Herder himself or herself that's where it draws the line for us it makes it so hard for us Lord if we know somebody hurts our past or hurts our friends hurts our family oh it's really hard on us it's hard for us to speak to him again it's hard for us to treat them the same but Lord Jesus help us to be like you are help us to reach out to The Davids in our life granted Lord I think when we can come to that spot from our soul we're probably not too many weeks away or months away from a body change we scream Seven Seals and holler seven trumpets and all that sort of thing but it's really the hidden things inside of our heart that tell Who We Are oh Jesus if I've ever took anything from any person if I've ever wronged any person forgive me Lord God if there's anything against me today I pray my father yet forgive me I don't want to leave this life with anything held Against Me Lord cleanse me Wash Me I don't just pray for myself I pray for everyone here Lord God or is there anyone here under the sound of my voice that would stand to your feet and say Lord that's my prayer too if there's anything I've done anything I've said if I have offended anybody if I've done anything wrong if I even if I don't even know about it North please forgive me please forgive me no wonder David said it is against thee and the only that I've sinned cleanse me from blood guiltiness Lord and I will be cleansed Wash Me with hyssop and I shall be washed God don't just forgive smoking God don't just forgive drinking God forgives it when you won't speak to that neighbor when you shun that one that's done your little wrong he specializes in forgiveness of those things too can we just bow our heads together and just pray for each other not necessary that you they hand on them if you don't want to but you're not just praying for yourself now you believe what you want to about this sermon but if you trust me as your pastor almighty God gave me this heavenly father in this solemn moment to Bow our heads and we're not just necessarily praying for ourself but we're praying for each other this morning we're praying Lord for those that we go to church with those that we love is our part of this flock but Lord we don't want to just limit it to that we want to pray for our brothers and sisters around the world and we most of all want to pray for those who have trespassed against us Lord we know from the remaining portion of this story as it goes on in time it hits the fail was bathsheba's grandfather and when Absalom raised up an Insurrection against David and wanted to divide the kingdom and pull people away from David's Kingdom ahithophel took sides with Epsilon and even though David had done wrong Absalom was not justified in what he had done and the hitherfell broke allegiance to God's anointed and we know the end of the story his counsel was rejected and he goes and takes his own life because he was on the wrong side in the time of battle he sided with the wrong leader oh Lord God I pray you would help us father we pray for those who've spoken against us we pray for those who have done us wrong from the young girls with those that go to school with the young men of people they work with that maybe laugh at him and ridicule them we pray for them for those that work in the medical field and they're laughed at because their sisters dress different than most of them we pray for them today forgive them Father we do not want to get a grudge like a hitherfell did and it didn't kill David but it took his own life because he would not let go of David's fault and David's sin but it ate on him and ate on him and the first opportunity of hitherfell saw he joined with Absalom to try to take the kingdom away from David but even though David was wrong he had repented and he was still your anointed Lord Jesus forgive us of our failures our

brother vandile that brother Harold Hilda Branch Church that had a prayer line brother Harold wanted me to preach that night so I went on the direction of faith we preached for prayed rather for several hundred people the last service which was on Sunday I didn't know what I was going to preach I was so tore up I wouldn't even go eat lunch you those of you that have heard brother van and brother biscoll they preached everything I felt like there was to preach they didn't leave nothing even in the back of the Bible the concordance for me to preach from I looked at the maps but they covered the maps too so I thought what in this world am I going to preach on what am I going to say I took care I said you go for lunch I need to be by myself I need some time from the Lord let us begin to pray and talk to him his presence come in that hotel room where I was at and he dealt with me about going down the line of the scarred human beings many of you have heard that I went a little bit different direction but that night as I began to preach and I knew in just just a few moments I was in the right Channel I began to preach I could see people weeping here and there and there and crying preach the sermons I was fixing to wind up brother Harold stepped up behind me said offer a prayer line I said we just had one the other night he said offer a prayer life I said all right I said brother Harold says if we want to have a prayer line anybody here would want to be prayed for we didn't have one we had three one preacher was at one prayer line another preacher was in another prayer line I was at another one the things I heard that night brother of people coming through people in their 80s one sister 90 years old the story she told me would break the heart of the hardest person they wouldn't come in through for cancer a few of them were but most of it was scars that had more Decades of their life brother Hildebrandt told me later he said call me a few days after I got home he said you act like he was really nervous that night I said I wasn't acting I was nervous and he said well I just wanted to let you know we've already had more requests for that sermon than all
