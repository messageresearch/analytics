Lord the reve word that was spoken by the prophet of Mal oh can't you see [Applause] [Music] one I'm so happy I've accepted the word of the Lord aren't you glad Pro of can't you see why this little bride so happy we've accepted the word of Our Lord the reveal word that was SP by the prophet of Caroline and I were talking about it just this afternoon wondering where would we be if it was for this great message maybe I'd be a Pentecostal still a Pentecostal pastoring a Pentecostal church maybe an evangelist traveling around from Pentecostal Church to Pentecostal church maybe some of you had still been on a bar stool maybe you had been in a Baptist Church or some other type of church but God's grace God's grace amen I'm so grateful for it Joel 2 verse 23 Joel 2 verse 23 and then we'll skip down to verse 28 be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he has given you the former Reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former for rain and the latter rain in the first month verse 28 and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and he believes in true prophecy amen your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days while I pour out my spirit now for us that are westerners and having been under the influence of Christianity most of our life if you would have been a Jew when this was prophesied by Joel it would have seemed seemed like absolute heresy to you because prophets were the ones of Sal Visions nobody else prophets were the ones that had God's spirit nobody else so you can imagine when they heard this prophecy in their day and they thought this man was out of his mind prophecy is tricky you see prophecy has a timeline on it now I know that some of you have probably seen some of the videos that have been put together and um I've gotten several different ones in the last few weeks and it's been people charismatic preachers and different types of preachers that have taken the things that brother brandham said about seeing a woman either being the president it would be a woman president or the Catholic Church put it on YouTube and lots of people of course have seen it and they themselves if they didn't cover exactly the way he said it now you know what that's going to do since Cala was not elected yesterday as president the danger with prophecy is that it can look like prophecy and yet not be now if Kamala Harris would have been voted in by the people of the United States it still would not mean she was the woman the prophet saw that's right right so it has to be the right person the right time so whenever we look at Joel's prophecy it was exactly the same way and yet the Fulfillment of it they probably looked for it for years and years but a man anointed by the Holy Ghost for the season when it fell said this is that that was spoken by the prophet Joel so sometimes we look at prophecy and we're thinking is this it is that it could that be it could that be it could that be it I don't mind telling you some message preachers put some things together a while back and I mean just by reading it on a couple of chats that I'm on I thought woo better be careful your brother you're going to get you're going to get in hornet nest here you're going to lay it out here to where if you're not careful you're going to get yourself hemmed up in a box that's why you don't hear me doing that ignorant stuff if God's Prophet didn't know whether or not as a woman or a church who are we that we think we do come on come on now so the best thing for us to do is just say Lord help me to find what's going on where the time is what's right I'm so glad that we can have that attitude I me like to be remembered tonight as we pray have a prayer call here for our brother Tyler I see him back there in the back tonight he had some needs he wanted us to to remember him for also I heard from Brother Wade and sister Anna altland today and they're in the need of prayer we have several of course in our church family that's fighting some real tough times right now sickness and things let's just remember them and take them before the Lord today Heavenly Father we count it oh once again such a great honor that we can be here on Wednesday night what a privilege how we love church on Wednesday night it just seems like it's such a boost for us Lord to help us I'm so glad that we don't have to go just from Sunday to Sunday I know there's churches all over the world and that's that's the only time they can get buildings and so on but I'm so grateful that we can have a midweek service lord it's just like another Holy Ghost Shop full of Holy Ghost steroids for us we just love coming together and singing and praising and praying and hearing your word thank you for it Lord I pray it never becomes common place to us Lord Jesus now as we approach you father we're asking for the needs among your children all the requests that was signified by the raising of a hand and we pray father that you would just help each one we have several in our church Lord that's dealing with some real difficult times right now we pray that you'd be mindful of them father I pray for brother Wade and sister Anna Lord that's so looking forward to being church tonight dear God that just things worked out to where they couldn't be but we pray that you'd be mindful of them this prayer cloth that I have in my hand tonight father from my young brother I pray that you'd minister to him Lord dear God help me tonight as I try to bring forth the word what you placed upon my heart today Lord help me to get out of the way Lord we we realize that our nation has come through a a very difficult time time a time of great Division and a lot of trauma and a lot of things that's that's went on and Lord I know that no matter how an election goes there's always going to be people disappointed but Lord I pray there may be people that we would differ with as far as our political views and all that but Lord I happen to know of an individual that at the last presidential election his wife got so distraught because it didn't go the way she thought it would and should and she got under such stress and such pressure that she wind up taking her life so Lord some of our fellow Americans tonight they're crying they're sad oh we may laugh at them cuz we're of the opposite party but they're still part of our nation Lord so I pray you'd help them because I realize Satan loves these opportunities to make people so despondent that they just take their life we know it don't make no difference who's in there anyway as far as being peace and bringing all that to the Earth there's only one that can do that and that's you but Lord however long that we can live here and have peace we certainly desire it but be mindful of us Lord God help us not to bring politics so into our lives and into our church that we don't even speak to one another because we're of a different political party and we can see it happening inside our message ranks not So Much by politics but by division of doctrinal issues help us I pray father will we ever grow up it's no wonder the Rapture hasn't come yet Lord it's a it's evident we've not grown up enough we're still fighting like children fighting like babies but help us I pray father speak to us your word may we have an element tonight Lord where we can grow as we hear your word father in the name of the Lord Jesus and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated now just in case tonight some of y'all are Wonder wondering did I vote Yes I did and let me tell you how I voted because it was a three-way election that I voted in the prophet describes it this way God voted for me the devil voted against me and the outcome will depend upon which way I voted come on so you know who I voted for almighty God Amen so that way I win in every election it don't really matter thank you Lord aren't you glad that we're part of that tonight let us go immediately now into the resume of the church ages from the church age book page 377 and let's resume on what we've been looking about on the the latter rain the former and the latter rain truly this is part of the prophecy of this hour where we're living you know it's sort of like if you go into a mall and you could go this way or that way or that way or and and you don't know where where you're going um most generally when you walk in an entrance whether it's on the east side the West Side the north side South Side whatever it is whenever you walk into that and they're going to have this large kios type of thing there one of the first things that they're going to identify is you are here so you are here in front of Kirklands in front of you know bels or whatever it is but it just so happens you're not looking for that store you're looking for Sears or you're looking for whatever more but you can't get to the other place if you don't know where you are so you got to find out where you are and then find out okay ultimately what I'm wanting to do I'm wanting to get ready to get in the Rapture so I can leave this world is that what we want we want to be ready we believe we're in the age of the Rapture so we need to find out where we are so Satan doesn't always work only on trying to confuse the people of where they're going but try to confuse them of where they are now dis sensationally if he can confuse people and try to tell them that they're actually still under the third word or the third ray of light or they've not really moved into the fourth ray of light or the fourth word that God said would come in the last days then what they're going to do is there in proximity to where they need to go it's going to put them way off so they're trying to look and say okay so where are we where are we you see that's where with the majority of Christendom today they don't have no clue where we are prophetically so the Lutheran there's several dispensation behind the Methodist there's several dispensations behind the Pentecostals are behind for some of the message people that have gone no farther than just God Center Prophet they are behind also and why does Satan do that because he knows they'll never get to where they need to be if they don't know where they are it's one reason why that so many people constantly fight the thing do I have the Holy Ghost do I or don't I well sometimes I think I do sometimes I think I don't I believe I do after that service oh yes I know that I do and then a preacher will preach another service and it leaves you hanging well I'm not sure now I don't know where I'm at don't you understand why he does that it's to confuse you it's to confuse you with your walk with God you cannot have abundant growing revelatory Fai in your walk with God if you're still struggling am I Born Again or not am I just Justified or Sanctified I don't know I need to know where I'm at I mean those what I'm talking about now I believe with all of my heart that in this last days that God has given us a message that we can apply the token with but it is not just a message of the token it is a message of assurance that we can know beyond a shadow of a doubt that we have passed from deaths unto life and then what does that do that helps us to be identified with where we are well if we know we're truly born again then we know when we hear messages preached that are calling us to a closer walk with God then by that being able to identify where we are then we know that message is not telling us that we need the Holy Ghost it's telling us we need to let the Holy Ghost we have mature itself and grow out of us and we're being corrected in that way but if a person is constantly going back and forth well I don't know if I got the holy ghost or or not I think I do I don't know if I do or not whenever they hear sermons they process it through that mixed state because they don't know where they are it's time for every person in this church to know where you are with God men women boys girls every one of us so we can know exactly where we are so we can go on from where we are and be what God has called us to be now let's watch this also then how that the church ages parallel the individual walk before God so watch this in page 377 paragraph 2 this age started just after the turn of the 20th century now notice the time frame where we are this is in the resume of the ages and it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost now remember this is the age when the true Brad is going to return to being the way she was at Pentecost not UA Street Pentecost but the original now remember what makes it so confusing sometimes is because we have two dispensations that are going to be called by similar names so the original was called the original Pentecost then another one happens in 1906 what do they call it Pentecostal so both of them now are going to have a move of God now watch this it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost no she's not returning to be the church but the bride we know there must be of necessity a return of dynamic power so it's not just intellectual it's not just reading it's not just knowledge it's not just quoting quotes quoting scriptures but there must be of necessity a return of dynamic power the Believers sense this in their spirits and begin crying to God for a new outpouring such as was in the first century now watch what's going going on the Believers sense this in their spirit so they're walking into the mall of God and they sense in their Spirit there's a promise there's a promise God God wants to restore God wants to send something back to us God wants to wants us to be on fire God wants us to have the manifestation of the gifts and the promised word and they begin to cry and they begin to pray now watch they're finding out where they are they're lacking something they need more now their Methodist grandmothers and grandfathers had shouted their mothers and fathers had become the Highway of Holiness people and some of the independent Pentecostals but it hasn't really yet merged so the Pentecostal is basically just a an upgrade on the the Nazarene and the Methodist but they still didn't have the restoration of gifts but they shouted and they more emotion was coming in the church services and they would pass out on the floor and they'd get fans and fan them and they' lay on the floor and theyd get water and pour it in their face I ain't talking about Pentecostals this was Methodist and Nazarene and hus people but now Watch What Happens what seemed to be the answer now you talking about tricky brother sister so genuine sincere people of God are seeking God's face they're sensing it in their Spirit they're looking at the mall directory as we would say and it's Sav you all are right here you need more than the methodus you need more than the nazarenes you need more and they began to pray and pray and what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the Spirit now remember the prophet said it seemed to be the answer so what did did they take this as oh my this is what they had on the day of Pentecost this is the original church it's happened again in California it's in Zeus the Street Revival this is it this is the original bride move come on now well it seemed that way I kind of figured y'all be quiet but I didn't think it'd be this soon it was then believed that this was indeed the long awaited restoration oh this is what we've waited for for years God said I'll restore sayith the Lord all the Canam all the Palmer worm the caterpillar I'll do it I'll do it now what's what's going on Satan is trying to confuse them on where they are and the prophecy at hand it all has to do with season and timing so they're convinced brother John this is acts two it's it's it's here it's on the earth now watch it was in believe that this this was indeed the long awaited restoration it was not sir for the latter rain can come only after the former rain which is the spring or teaching rain amen the latter rain then is the Harvest rain how could this be the real thing when the teaching Reign had not come the prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people to turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers had not yet come but as far as they were concerned they didn't need him anyway so instead of looking by the word and saying okay well we are part of it but it don't end here there there comes something greater than us this is the restoration of gifts but instead of leaving their message where God put it as the restoration of gifts they said this is the definite evidence that you've got the Holy Ghost now when they added those few words words the spirit of organization got in this move then everybody that spoke in tongues as far as the way they looked at it had the Holy Ghost we've been there done that ain't we Lance oh yeah well as soon as you spoke in tongues that was it you got the Holy Ghost now think what Satan had done sincere people crying praying seeking God looking in the Bible hungering and thirsting after God no wonder the prophet said if it's God you seek be sure it's God you get right good advice don't you think now what so they thought and taught that what happened in 190 six was the light of rain but they had it backwards the light of rain can only come after the former Reign comes first and the prophet had not even been born yet certainly had not come to his maturity in his message to bring the word now notice as he goes on he says that the prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the the children back to the Pentecostal fathers had not yet come but we've got this group then that was come out in 1906 and they made the claim we are the original Pentecostals we are the original it's been born just like it was and Acts 2 but when you go to reading Acts 2 compared to what they had it wasn't or acts 8:16 or acts 8 or any of them other places praise the Lord but yet they made the claim to originality to originality you see the Catholic Church does exactly the same thing and the bride makes the same claim that's the very claim of all the churches they are the original well I'll tell you how we're going to know who is come on the one who leaves the world in a body change that's right that will be the latter rain and the latter rain will anoint their former Reign you see only those who receive the former Reign under the prophet's Ministry of Malachi 4 will actually have seed life to be anointed for the latter rain so Pentecost then had it B backwards now did they have great manifestation of gifts yes there was great healing there was signs there was wonders there was Miracles my brother Jim Woodson was telling us whenever we went over into badine North Carolina making some deliveries over there and some of his family was over there and he was telling us about some of the people and they used to prophesy and have prophecies that was just unbelievable the prophecies that they give out absolutely incredible not some of this gener IC stuff that we hear today but you you'll be here and you'll go there and you'll do this and you'll do that and happen exactly to the letter didn't it brother Jim and you know some of the ones even that I saw in Pentecost Lance and his family also have seen and some of you with your backgr but yet making that the evidence of the Holy Ghost is the denominational spirit that Satan wanted now notice what he said thus what was thought to be the restoration and the final quickening unto the Rapture had not come in it was a mixture of the unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessing and manifesting in the Holy Ghost as we've kept pointing out to you and it also was devil power so can you imagine in a church meeting the Holy Ghost is falling and people are being blessed and getting saved and my speaking in tongues and whatever more that they were doing and demons were moving right in that same service and people were becoming possessed by demons and it also was devil power as men were under the control of devils yet no one seemed to realize it then to prove that it was not the real these people even before a second generation had appeared organized wrote their unscriptural doctrines and built their own fences and this is what I say to us as message people if we are not careful we are heading to the same fulfillment of this quote right here we're going to make our own fences we're going to make our own this is what we believe and we don't believe nothing else but that period stop that's the end of it bless God I'll tell you one thing and if you don't see it the way we do you ain't going what what's the difference between us in any other organization when we do that my we can't even go to a to a Mee and because well I'll tell you one thing they don't believe this the way I do you know what if we're not careful we're going to get to a place we can't go nowhere we won't have no confidence in nobody but oursel and you get that away and you're losing fellowship with god well come on somebody say amen amen oh my notice they wrote their unscriptural doctrines and built their own fences as every other group ahead of them did look at all the fences friends that are around us look at the fences many of you that have been around the message for years and years you've been in one fence and into another and out of that one into another what's a fence for it's to group people or animals or something together and put a fence around them and keep them in there and not let nobody in or not let nobody out well bless God I'll tell you one thing you can't come to our church if you don't so and so we won't let you do who in the world gave you the keys to the kingdom who in the world made you the bishop over God's people and their souls to say you can't come boy if you don't have church the way we do at our church you ain't even having Church who made your church the example for everybody in the message well Hallelujah notice remember while Jesus was upon the Earth so was Judas each came from a different spirit spirit and upon death each went to his own place the spirit of Christ later came back upon the true church and the spirit of Judas came back upon the false church now do you understand there are people in our message ranks that are working under the spirit of Judas they will betray true men of God they will lie on them sell them out for money or whatever working under the spirit of Judas there will be some preachers that will be saved if no more for the reason that God can prove to the devil he can do it some of the greatest troublemakers I've ever met in my life are men who said they're preachers let me tell you something every a man that says he's a preacher don't mean he's a man of God that's right there's all kinds of men that are preachers but it don't mean they God call in come on now don't get quiet on me already how do you judge them by the word not by signs so watch the spirit of Christ came back upon his church the spirit of Judas came back upon the false church now watch what about the true seed it will happen just as we have said the people of God are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age can't you see why the devil is trying to come in our own ranks I know friends you may wonder why is brother Donny keeps saying this why does brother Donnie keep going this way because whether or not you understand it more and more preachers around this message are not preaching the message at all some of them won't even stand and read quotes anymore they won't even stand and make references to what the prophet taught in this day well if that's what you want I'll tell you one thing it's time for you to leave or me one because as long as I'm going to be here at this church I'm not only going to preach the Bible I'm going to preach to you the message of this hour it's going to take the message of this hour to get us out of here we've heard the story of Jonah we've heard the story of uh of Noah we've heard all of that it's going to take more than that to get us out of here and a body change it's going to take the message of Malachi 4 so the people of God are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age in her will be the fullness of Pentecost but my question to you is which one the Acts 2 version or the isusa street one cuz they are not the same that's why I'm not interested friends in mixing ausa street with what we have I've done been there and done that if I wanted that why in the world was I hungering for something more I should have just stayed where was ain't that right brother Larry but it didn't satisfy me when I was in it it sure won't satisfy me now after I've eat the good food I've been eating now oh my in her will be the fullness of Pentecost how many believes this amen for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at beginning the beginning that is is thus sayith the Lord now watch again in page 379 and he reads these scriptures in Joel 2 that I read to you when we open the service now it says God is going to restore the Lutheran AIDS did not restore the church it started a Reformation the westan AIDS did not restore the Pentecostal age now notice the Pentecostal age did not restore so why would I want to point you back to what Pentecost had when it did not restore it was an added element do we need it yes do we need justification what about sanctification well if we need them to then wouldn't you say we also need the restoration of [Music] gifts oh my but God has to restore for he cannot deny his word this is not the resurrection of the church it is the restoration God will take the church right back to Pentecost of differentiation now the beginning notice in verse 25 Joel two the Locust cankerworm caterpillar Palmer worm have eaten all but the root and a small bit of the stem now we are told that all those insects are of one and the same in different stages they are the Antichrist spirit manifested in organization denomination and false Doctrine Through the Ages notice organization denomination and false Doctrine do you understand many of the message people that we're not an organization and they think they're exempt because they're preaching false Doctrine it's the same Antichrist Spirit you may not have the structure of an organization that your head is in Cleveland Tennessee or up in akan Ohio but when you deny the word of God for the hour you're anointed by Antichrist I love this and the poor little root and stalk is going to be restored God isn't going to plant a new church but he's going to bring his original planting back to the original seed he is doing it as stated in verse 23 by the teaching or former Reign next will come the Harvest rain or rapturing facei but why is the Harvest rain going to fall on now you see whenever they would plant this and the prophecy that they gave he was taking the planting season as it would have been in the country of Israel and that part of the Mediterranean so they would get the early rains in the springtime and then they would break up the ground they would plant the seed in the ground wherever it was suitable depending on what type of product that they wanted and then the former rign they would sew that down and the seed would be planted and the latter rain would produce the crop so the latter rain depending on what it fell upon it would produce the crop look at our nation the state that it's in how do we get here because some of our fathers our grandfathers some of the Senate some of the Congress of years ago that started passing some of these liberal bills and these woke moves that's all around everywhere that's what's got us where we are now when a boy don't even know if he's a boy no more and a girl don't know if she's a girl no more come on Church what we've never thought would ever get to such a place my goodness that that our government would want to put tampons in a in a in a man's bathroom are you kidding me you mean we got men that are that insane yeah we do they are that insane and they want to run our government well praise the Lord and it's going to get worse and worse as we go in time oh but brother Donnie Donald Trump wanted he's going to take us back to God don't you believe that for one minute of your life there's only one way we're going back to God that is not by Donald Trump or the Republicans or the independent that's by the coming of the Lord Jesus I know a lot of people are making Donald Trump the Messiah he ain't my Messiah he is not my savior I'm looking for my Lord Jesus to come amen oh Hallelujah notice this my my next will come the Harvest rain or rapturing F so when the Harvest rain falls on the bride who's been feeding for years on this revealed word what will it produce in her it will turn her inside out she's feeding and storing that word up in her soul her soul will manifest that final attribute of God inside of her and it will start from the inside of her soul and come out to her body her eyes will change her hair will change her limbs will change and in a moment in a twinkling of an ey she will be chain why because she's been feeding on the anointed word of Malachi 4 and the light of rain which is rapturing Faith is going to fall on him what's it going to do to the World Council of churches head up in the person of the devil in the form of the Antichrist come on somebody what's he going to do to the nations of the world they're going to gather in the plains of the field Where I Stood many years ago in the valley of megiddo as I stood up there where Elijah had stood there near his cave and look to the left as far as you can see and look to the right as far as you can see and there in the valley of magto and they will gather together all the nations of the world and the L of rain's going to fault and what are they going to do try to kill the Jews and they're going to come against them and the Lord Jesus will come but you and I won't be there as far as down on the earth we're going to come back riding on white horses why we have been anointed to fly we have been anointed to feed on the unfailing body word of the son of man and when the Lord Jesus comes to fight the battle of Armageddon and he'll look around behind him and say come on children go with and there will come the Bride of the Ephesian age of the samna age of the Sardis age of the thyra age and there will be as that bride Hallelujah the resurrected dead anointed by the latter [Applause] rain Hallelujah notice this thus at this very moment moment we're in the complete fulfillment of Matthew 24:24 in so much if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect and who is that that shall attempt to deceive the very elect while the spirit of the Antichrist in the false anointed ones of this last day these false ones have already come in jesus' name wow so you mean they're not just saying father son Holy Ghost they've updated they're saying in Jesus name claiming they have been anointed by God for the last day they are the false Messiahs anointed ones they claim that they are prophets but are they one with the word never they have added to it or taken from it now listen this is the tricky part no one denies that the spirit of God manifesting in gifts is upon them but like balum they all have their programs make their appeal for money exercise gifts but deny the word or bypass it notice the difference now some of them will deny it others will just bypass It Go Around It Don't Preach anything don't say anything that's going to cause anybody any problems you jellyfish well we believe in Holiness here but we we we we ain't going to preach it for about 35 years we're going to see if we can win somebody in it might be that very thing they need deliver to their minis skirts well praise the Lord hallelujah notice but the deny the word or bypass it for fear that a controversy might diminish their chances for greater gain so whether it's monetary or following or numbers uhhuh so they just you know scur around certain things don't you understand every true man of God will be faced with that Temptation right there every one of them and he will know it and he will see it and he can look at one side and see if he just skirts around certain things Don't Preach this don't say that don't say that you'll be more liked you'll be more accepted you'll have a bigger following you'll have this and that and the other and then he'll see the other side the harder way the narrow way people will walk away from you they'll turn back from you they'll ridicule you they'll run you down they'll stab you in the back they'll do this that the other well what person as far as feelings wouldn't rather choose the easier way oh yeah sure everybody will like me man aive them and who wants you know who wants to be shot at and who wants this and that and the other who wants to do all that sort of thing so every servant of God will face that challenge every one of them and it's not like they'll face it once some some some of them will face it over and over again because God is using them to prove to the devil I've still got some boys down on the earth in the latest in age you compromise and you'll do everything you can devil but you can't get my boys cuz they're born of my jeans oh yeah watch this oh my they deny the word or bypass it for fear that a controversy might diminish their chances for greater gain yet they preach listen salvation and deliverance through the power of God so they're not sing there offering you a rosary they're not telling you to pray to St Andrew for this and St Anthony for that and you know St Joseph for this and that and the other they are preaching Deliverance by the salvation of the Lord Jesus and preaching Deliverance by the power of God just like Judas was a Ministry imparted by Christ remember he tells us in the church age book that Judas did not have an inferior Ministry so un like the 11 they were all anointed and they casting out devils and you know doing all the supernatural things and Judas is just kind of carrying along nothing ever followed his ministry and he couldn't ready preach I imagine he is probably one of the most charismatic preachers in the whole bunch I imagine that dude had Miracles that was phenomenal makes you think no I Miracles that was so phenomenal you've heard me say it from years and years ago that when the Lord Jesus said one of you is going to betray me they questioned thems before they even questioned him when you look at the Last Supper and the way that they set they didn't set the way we set like this you're setting this way but they prostrated themselves on Long sofas and they would have been leaning back one against the other Judas was right by the Lord Jesus and when they look at him at the table they thought oh no he's fixing to take Jesus place he already had the money Jesus really trusted him even though he was a thief that's right when they said it's the last supper and they come in and sit down and they looked up there sitting at the table here's the center of the table arced sort of like this and they looked up there and there was Judas and he said oh dear God Judas must be going to take over Jesus had been telling us he's going to leave I knew Judas was a Preacher Man I knew that guy had Supernatural I didn't know he was going to take over well it wasn't actually that Judas was going to take over Judas was going to be taken over Satan having now entered into the heart of Judas Simon's son Jesus knowing all things have been given to him by the father oh Lord he was so close they looked right at him and didn't see it Jesus said have not I chose 12 of you and one of you is a devil not going to be but already is imagine Jesus having a devil in his ministry team wow notice oh my they preach out salvation and deliverance to the power of God just like Judas with a Ministry imparted by Christ but because they are wrong seed consequently they have a wrong Spirit motivating them religious oh my they outshine the elect in effort and Zeal wow but it is leot toan not of Christ for it looks for big crowds big programs and startling signs amongst them startling signs so not something that could be questioned but a sign that is so phenomenal it would be startling boy I got you thinking tonight ain't it yeah good deal startling signs among them they preach the second coming of Christ but deny the Advent of the Prophet messenger a so they preach the coming of Christ but they don't preach the bride coming of Christ and they don't preach the coming of Christ to reveal himself in profit form in the last days remember he tells us in sort 1965 the Elijah of this day is the Lord Jesus Christ he will come according to Luke 1730 let me just tell you what God's given to us so there was a family that lost an 18-year-old son brother Welch Evans and his wife so they were tore a piece and brother Brandon was out of town they try to call get in touch with him they call Billy Paul brother Brandon returns to call he says brother wel the Lord hasn't showed me anything about your son I I I don't know he hasn't showed me you can find this in Sister Angel's book gener ations testimonies so he said let me let me see let me pray let me see if I can find something from the Lord so he told them he searched the regions the regions and couldn't find him nowhere so he went back to where the automobile that he was in hit a truck so he went back to that place and then he calls brother welz and tells him he must have been in the passenger seat up front because I saw the wreck so you imagine God lets him now see the wreck again in a vision and he said I saw the wreck and when the car hit the truck I saw a light go out of the passenger side in the front seat and it went up before the Throne of God brother Welch if you want to know where your son is right now he's talking to my daughter Sharon Rose glory to God and brother wch if we could ask him did he want to come back he would tell you Daddy I don't want to come back and he said when you see him again to him it will only seem like he's been gone from you for three [Music] minutes for three minutes why they've broke into eternity why would God save all these secrets of the sixth dimension for us in the last day because we had to find out where we were and where we're going when we leave here and where our loved ones are and they are not dead and there's something about hearing it preached and we're talking about it you notice that atmosphere as it started changing when I started talking about that what is it hearing that present day truth brings us closer to that dimension remember it's not but 20 ft from us for those of you that was here the other night and brother Lewis is and I I preached about changing his address and brother Lewis had signed a change of address notification and I gave his new address 20 6 and seven 20 ft from us sixth Dimension seventh Church age 26 and 7 amen hallelujah but remember we're not just going to 26 and 7 but we're going to wind up on 8 because 8 is a new beginning The Eighth Day speaks of Eternity why was it that God never allowed Paul to preach the message of the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride why was it reserve for us in this last day why couldn't Peter preach things that are to be it was reserve for the bride at the end time those that are going to be a living Remnant Hallelujah when the lter rainfalls she'll already have them seeds in her heart she'll already have the future home she'll already have recognizing your day and the lighter rain will fall on that seed Oh Glory to God so you imagine Lance and you four girls the next time you see your mama to her alone to be like she's gone about 3 minutes Paul's been there for 2,000 years over 2,000 years but it's like you just arrived they ain't going nowhere they ain't got nothing to do they ain't got no times ain't got no clocks they ain't got no schedules they've just arrived they broke into eternity Hallelujah where was that oh let me find myself here they preached the second coming of Christ but deny the Advent of the Prophet messenger though empowering signs and true Revelation he eclipses them all can anybody give me a big hearty Amen to [Applause] that ah yes this false spirit in the last day is so close to the real it can be distinguished distinguished only by its deviation from the word wow but he's already told us that they can have signs wonders Miracles right preach salvation preach Deliverance but wonder what they'll deviate from apparently they're not going to deviate from salvation not going to deviate from Supernatural come on well this is kind of one of them services that get you thinking don't it now watch and whenever it is caught and being anti- word it falls back on the one argument we have already shown to be false we get results don't we we have to be of God [Music] we're getting people saved people's getting healed we get results don't we we have to be of God ah what crucial times are these in which we live can everybody say Amen to that how careful we must be that we remain True to this word and not take from or add to it for he who would speak what God has not spoken makes him a liar so for some around the ranks of the message is simply taking away the need to assemble ourselves together we don't need to we've got the tapes we've turned our homes into churches there before we go to church every day cuz we play tapes every day in our home so we really don't need to go to church because our home is our church and we don't need one another and we don't uhuh so you just took away that's right from what your very Prophet said Christ The Mystery of God revealed that if God is in your heart you can't wait for them doors back there to open to get in and fellowship with your brothers and sisters and if you don't feel like that I'll tell you it's time you got to praying but you see reason we say oh well Ephesians 4 says that he gave some Apostles and and some prophets and some pastors because some people need them your name was just took from the book of life you are twisting Ephesians 4 to match your own ideology reading the original Greek it does not even implied in such a way so some people need to go to church but we don't cuz we listen to tapes and we really don't need to yeah you just added to and took away think of it friends think of it oh Lord Jesus what I have particularly in mind is this about the turn of the century the hunger for God that was generated in the Philadelphian age brought a cry for the spirit of God and when the cry was answered by God sending forth manifestation in tongues and interpretation and prophecy a group immediately and most contrary to the word Drew up a doctrine that tongues was the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost tongues was far from evidence they were manifestation but not evidence the falsity of the doctrine can all oh my not only be seen by lack of scripture to substantiate it but those who subscribed to the doctrine immediately organized on the basis of the doctrine proven they were not in the truth as they would have people believe oh it look good it look look like the return of Pentecost now you realize there some of the preachers in our message that's going around and preaching you know if you're not having meetings like this with them preaching of course in your church you better leave your church now they don't go ahead and tell you the rest of it but I'll go ahead and tell you the rest of it leave the church you're going to and move to their church cuz we're the one that's got the move of God now you see what that's doing it's making another denomination so then whoever believes like we believe we're the ones with the move of God well I wonder if we judge the Ephesian Church by your church or the Corinthian Church by your church one if to have the type of meetings you have in your church in Corinth so I don't understand why God didn't make your church one of the original 12 and instead of making them the original 12 and told you to be like them instead of them trying to be like you whoa we got a problem here Houston but you see what they do oh we're it we're it we've got it boy we've got the brides move how many brides revivals have we have and they put a fence around it and when you do you're cutting yourself off Word of Life Church please I beg you as a servant of God don't never do that to us amen we will cut ourselves off from God when we do it and it won't happen immediately it never does but in time we'll sever ourself from the rest of the body and then we are this Elite whatever we think we are and we look down our nose at everybody else and you know what God will do God will move right around us and reach out there and get grab a hold of alley rats if he has to he'll do whatever he's got to do don't think that we have any Monopoly on God don't think that you can say who can go to heaven and who can't go to heaven don't think that you can say well bless God I'll tell you one thing I don't this God ain't asking you God is telling you what his word says and expects you to do it is that right no it proved it wasn't it could not before for it organized that is death not life it looked so close to the real that multitudes were deceived now if it wasn't the genuine what was it it was the husk the CHF in the green soft sheath form it looked like it was the real thing but as you go into the field and see what looks exactly like wheat and yet it's only the husk for the wheat seed had not yet formed so this was but the soft shell that looked like the real grain Yet to Come the original wheat seed of Pentecost was to come back in the last age it had been buried at N Sea it sent up a shoot at Sardis it grew a tsel at Philadelphia it was a mature to look at leaa but it would not be back to the original until the word was restored the prophet had not yet yet come upon the scene but now according to the time wherein we stand in the Le of and age the prophet messenger of Revelation 10:7 must already be in the land praise the Lord once more thus saith the Lord must be here already oh Hallelujah to be manifested with infallible Vindication thus is the true seed already maturing and then the Harvest but what happened in every one of these ages they were living in a glare of the past age notice this an identified Christ what was the matter with the Lutheran living in the glare of the Lutheran age when John Wesley found the secret of sanctification they couldn't go they were living in the glare of Luther's age what happened to the Pentecost is why wesle was organized until he was living the glare of another age that was in Wesley's age when the baptism of the Holy Ghost fell upon the Pentecostals they were living in what Wesley said sanctification it was hard for them to believe the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the restoration of the gifts they was living in the glare of another age now we find out that now we find our Pentecostal Brethren are living in the glare of a Pentecostal age and they still miss it they're trying trying to interpret the Pentecostal age when we're Plum past that amen well tell me how can I be past it if I've got people trying to tell me I need to go back to it come on now brother Donnie are you saying well that we're past it we don't need it no no we took the truth out of that that's right and brought it with us God sent justification what they do they formed an organization out of it God called the elect out they pulled the truth of justification out with them and merg it into the new message sanctification is that right then what did they do sanctification they formed an organization around that and then God sent the restoration of the gifts over and over again the prophet calls it that for Pentecost restoration of the gifts and they took justification sanctification merged it right in with the restoration of gifts and then they could look back at the westl move and say we're beyond that it didn't mean they didn't believe in sanctification when the prophet said we're Beyond Pentecost it don't mean that we're beyond the Pentecostal baptism of the Holy Ghost but we're in another time frame and the church said so do we believe in justification if your bride you do do we believe believe in sanctification do we believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the message that Martin Luther brought of justification was all right for Luther's age but that's as far as it went sanctification was fine in Wesley's age that was as far as it went then we come into the Pentecostal age and the restoration of the gifts is a very fine thing it was fine in the age but we're going beyond that now we are beyond that now come on CH it's got to where that you can't even read quotes like this in certain message churches they will shut down on you when it gets to where I cannot preach the message of the hour it's time for me to stay home yep if I can't preach the message I'll stay at the house I mean until y'all want me to go somewhere else Do We Believe It or Not we've got to become Beyond this thing because we've done the same thing with it they did before make an idol amen out of it I belong to this order of it I belong to that order notice he doesn't call it denomination but he calls it order God will send somebody that'll smash that thing amen and tear it to Pieces praise the Lord and confirm his word the full word notice praise be to God now we see that's true God rich in his Mercy let us stand let me share one more with you tonight Luther went to husk with his first word that just shall live of Faith Wesley had two words sanctification second definite work of Grace Pentecost had the third word the restoration of the gifts remember the Pentecostal message is the restoration of the gifts the bride's message is more than restoration of the gifts praise the lord it's that plus Pentecost had the third word restoration of gifts but the entire seed has to come forth notice Luther had a word Wesley had a word Pentecost had a word but the fourth word is the entire seed no wonder Satan wants to keep people in a glare of the age behind them because they focus on one word or another one word or another one word why stop at restoration of gifts when we can get the entire seed which includes all the gifts amen I took her the other day after the service on Sunday was talking about receiving the love of God or the god of love and I told her I was sitting at the house Sunday afternoon and just going back through the service and the word and stuff and I said you know our daughters have a portion of your love our church has a portion of your love your mother your siblings your nieces your cousins but I have you you and I said it's the same with me people in our church have a portion of my love I said Harry my brother mention Justin my sister-in-laws and mention my grandchildren my my daughters but I said you have me and know me in a way unlike any of them do amen you know me when I'm down you know me when I'm low oh you just be around me and tell why cuz she has me I don't want just one word amen I don't want just two words I don't want just three words I want him and if I get him I get the gifts now if anybody tells you that brother Donnie don't believes the gifts you look them in the face and you tell them they are a liar I believe in the gifts and I want every one of them that God wants you in our church but I cannot produce them amen and neither can you amen oh my you see how they denominated on one word and another word and another word but there's got to be something that cannot be denominated it's the entirety of the life that's in there that has to produce itself again on a bride justification yes sanctification yes gifts yes but remember people focus so much on speaking in tongues and brother brim said speaking in tongues was the least of all the gifts and okay uh I'll admit it I am really weird okay you can you can nod your head that's okay not going to hurt my feelings I am weird I am strange I'm bizarre I have some very unusual thoughts I believe in all nine spiritual gifts instead of just three three was what I heard mainly talked about in Pentecost three is what mainly here and talked about in the message I wonder why we don't want the other six so when we pull up all these quotes about gifts of the Spirit do we not know there's six more included in that yes for our church I don't want just tongues interpretation or prophecy I want Discerning of spirits which will be two or three Witnesses that will discern when somebody's speaking in tongues and then they'll sign their name on it amen and say tell brother Dave tomorrow not to go to that certain job that he's got set because coming through there'll be a an American propane truck come through about 12:00 and if he's there it's going to blow up and it'll blow that whole house where he's at tell him not to go thus sayeth the Lord amen and then it's laid up on the platform here this way the prophet Tau it I know we don't want it wonder if that's one of them words wonder if that's one of them words that somehow we think we have a superior understanding to than our Prophet messenger brother sister when we head that way we're headed for trouble that's right I don't care how long you've preached how much you've sung shouted jumped jerked whatever you've done who in the world in this message thinks they have got more understanding than the prophet messenger that God sent to bring us this way m m let me close with this seeds on air with a shock once a carrier of a true word justification then it became a carrier of sanctification then it became a carrier of the baptism of the Holy Spirit restoration of the gifts but then when he goes on and keeps going back try to eat something Mana from another day it's rotten it's no good a genuine Eagle of this day knows that was all right but we got that plus amen I'm sorry well no I ain't sorry actually you're not keeping from me my pluses amen you're not going to hem me up on justification saying we ain't going no farther I've done been farther than that you ain't going to hem me up on sanctification and you certainly ain't going to H me up on gifts and say well this is the light of the day this is the bride's Revival I'm sorry I had that years ago amen amen I've got that already I've had gifts of the Spirit in my life since I was a kid amen God's given me many words from people amen God used me when I was a kid I go pray for people he put it on my heart Carol's been with me one to man at Uncle's house one time and I just a boy me and Carol just got married and I told him said I'm not sure why I'm here can I go in your bedroom I said sure I mean this acting real scared and I was too I didn't know what in the world was going on out I knew was the Lord had sent me up there so Carol stayed in the living room prayed with them I went in there I started praying praying praying come out in a few minutes the Holy Ghost all over me I couldn't hard him stand still shaking and quivering like a leaf so I said can I pray for you'all I said yeah yeah there's real scared I started praying God prayed out of me the very secret of their hearts God prayed out of me things they had discussed before I got there you believe God still does the same thing that's this man right here and this one right here when they were traveling the other day and they were delivering some disaster relief to the flood deal and all that come back to service the next day and they they they said it sound like brother donning was riding in the truck with us how in the world did he know that I didn't but God does why same Holy Ghost same Holy Ghost come on children he is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart the word is not a man come on I'm not looking for a man to tell me what my name is I've know that since I knee high to a grasshopper I'd rather have the word discern my very heart let that word discern you what does it do it brings his presence right down where we are do we believe in that that's the kind of gifts I want in our church yes we got that plus until Jesus Christ is Manifest in the fullness of his power I'll get to you I'm on a detour I know you don't know it but I'm on a detour but where the Prophet said that the fullness of the son of man will be among his people in the last day deity the fullness of the godhead bodily on the earth in the form of a bread so no I'm not stopping at justification I'm not stopping at the restoration of gifts I want the giver amen I've got to go further back than isusa Street I've experienced ausa Street and I wasn't satisfied I've shouted I've run I've danced brother Chuck Dixon and I were sitting in a location a certain night under a tent a very strange presence come on the platform everybody else was gone remember brother Chuck was sitting there I seen an angel of the Lord walk around the outside perimeter of the tent tent was rolled up my hair stood upon the back of my neck like that and I seen him standing out there the spirit of God spoke to me and said go meet him I said Lord I'm afraid I said brother Chuck I just seen an angel of the Lord I've got to go out and pray brother Chuck said Lord have mercy brother Donnie he got down on the platform hit his face like this on out found a solitary place where the presence of God come I was a Pentecostal he told me something about my Ministry and things that would happen I've experienced that but why did it leave me hungry why did it leave me searching I saw a little Carside boy one time come up for prayer I laid my hands on him I watched almighty God straighten his eyes out straight as they could be I did it leave be Hunger for More don't just give me one word two words three words give me the volume of the book amen Lord Jesus help us to that father Lord God God we we thank you for what what we've experienced and what we've had Lord we don't want to stop with one word or two words oh those experiences that I've had and some of them I've had Lord I'll never repeat because they're just meant for me and you to know but yeah Lord the ones I've had have been wonderful but Jesus Jesus I still crave a hunger a thirst and I read a statement the other day where your Prophet said what we need so much in the church is a Revival of love I've thought oh my goodness is this part of that Capstone a Revival of Love setting down on the bride right before she goes away help us Jesus add to our justification add to our sanctification add to our restoration of gifts word upon top of word on top of word justification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the bap baptism of the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost itself it's amazing that the prophet said there was something more that he had to preach to his church he preached many them great sermons The Seals and Christ of mystery warning then judgment all that and he said now there's something more there's another step for this church and that was the token oh Jesus we love your signs we love your Miracles oh God I long to see more of them but Lord God I not going to Major on just healings and deliverances and signs and wonders God I want people that are so in love with you and so in love with each other Lord God that people can talk about them and run them down and whatever and they're so full of the love of God that they're praying for forgiveness let's talk about being like Jesus then Judas could heal like you but he couldn't love like you oh Jesus help me to love like you help me to forgive like you help me Lord to draw a bigger Circle it seems that as we go on in time let's message people are getting better and better and better at drawing smaller circles instead of bigger ones and we sure didn't get that from our Prophet messenger cuz men told him they were drawing him out and he said whenever you do Brothers I'll just draw you right back in people don't have to draw us out anymore we'll draw them out and throw them out forgive us God help us to get out from under this sectarian anointing in the last days Lord Jesus help us God lord I've been wondering and thinking about all this flood relief and I've heard so many different testimonies of people in our community and people from Elizabeth and Johnson City and different ones I heard another one yesterday people that had heard all kinds of things about us criticized us and said this and that even one man said the Lord rebuked him for things that he had said about us cuz he found out what he had said and what he had heard wasn't even the truth some of the finest people ever met in his life he said so Lord let our light shine let them see Jesus let them Feel Jesus when around Lord oh hallelujah we're not handing out Church age books and seal books we don't have message water we don't have message Cheerios it's just plain old Cheerios but it's bride delivering Cheerios and the bride delivering poptarts and crackers and baby Dippers Hallelujah let them sense it Lord Jesus Jesus let our light so shine father I pray we worship you tonight Lord you didn't say by this shall all men know that you are my disciples because you cast out Devils because you have Miracles because you said in Matthew 24 they'll come before you in that day and say they've done all that and I'll say to them depart from me I never knew you but you said by this shall all men know that you are my disciples because you have such love it's recorded by some of Nero's historians and some of those and the other Emperors that when they would bring the Christians to burn them to kill them they kept commenting about the love they had not only for each other but for their enemies so before before they would light the Torches and set some of our brothers and sisters on fire our brothers and sisters would bow their heads and pray for their forgiveness they would put sheep scans on their children and turn them loose in the Coliseum and turn the dogs the leopards the Lions loose on their little children dressed up like sheep and make them parents stand there and watch it and then parents would bow their heads and pray for their forgiveness and we wonder why we're not any closer to you if somebody does something to us we'll never forgive them we'll hold a grudge against him the rest of our life and say we're restored I wonder Jesus help us God we hold things against people and get bitter and then say we're bright and our brothers and sisters had to watch their babies brains be beat out wives watch their husband's guts be tore from their bodies and pray for their enemies and we say we've got the same Holy Ghost and if people people cross us we cut them off won't have nothing to do with them forgive us Lord forgive us Lord anybody willing to say that with me tonight forgive us Lord for us forgive us teach us how to love Jesus we worship you father we bless your name Lord oh Hallelujah can we just raise our hands in the presence of the God who is love thank you Lord teach us how to live in love and dwell in the land of love oh we'd rather dwell in the land of the Miracles and the signs and the Wonders or the financial blessings and live in the land of the material live in the land of Lea as Carol and I saw a video on YouTube the other day of Russia's new bomb called Satan to they can send it from Russia to any place around the world in 30 minutes and under it can have multiple Warheads up to 15 Warheads on one missile 500 times the power that was on the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki Hypersonic and so far we have nothing to catch it or stop it and they can control each of those Warheads so they send it up above the Earth's atmosphere in an arc way above her radar can read it and then they bring it straight down and when they come down so far say over Central States they can designate one head to go War of the Warhead to go to New York another of remember all nuclear one to go to Los Angeles one to go to Colorado one to go here one to go there and there we look up and there they are well I say we we're not going to be here and they called the name of that missile Satan to and they're new super Hypersonic plane that's going to carry it

being on the gifts of the Spirit my goodness I've done just out of curios this week I I studied the words looked at the words gifts of the Spirit and put in quotation marks so it would only pull up those words from 1947 to 1965 our Prophet mentioned those words 73 times through a span of 1947 to 1965 and some preachers are mentioning it every service you say what's wrong with us and you go to looking at love and you go to look at at forgiveness and you go to look at some of these other things thousands of times are we balanced or all way off somewhere may God help us har sing something

included verses 1 to six so he started preaching Revelation 10 1- 7 I don't want to just preach Revelation 107 I want to include verses one to six I don't want just healing I don't want just signs I
