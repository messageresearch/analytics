[45:32] her between her and my guardian angel I
[45:36] won't even get no reward when I get
[45:41] there I'm all the time getting into
[45:43] precarious and difficult situations and
[45:45] I was in one yesterday and Carol and I
[45:47] was talking about it after the situation
[45:48] and I said when it's all said done
[45:51] whenever I stand before the Lord my
[45:53] guardian angel will get every Speck of
[45:55] reward should been in my name
[45:58] she said yeah right now he's probably
[46:00] saying thank you Jesus thank you
[46:05] Jesus amen certainly appreciate my
[46:10] wonderful beloved
[46:13] wife she's been such a help to me
[46:16] through the
[46:17] years I apologize to her quite
[46:20] frequently not because I've committed
[46:23] adultery on her or anything like that
[46:27] but because of being a preacher all the
[46:30] burden that I brought upon her
[46:33] life and I tell her all the time she
[46:35] could have found men that were
[46:37] definitely a whole lot more handsome
[46:38] don't you'all say Amen to
[46:40] that men that could have probably
[46:43] provided a whole lot better for her but
[46:46] I guarantee you one thing she could have
[46:48] never found another one that would love
[46:50] her any more than I do and I'm so
[46:54] grateful to God for
[47:01] I believe this is our shortest time
[47:03] together we're going to be reunited
[47:05] again on that other side praise the Lord
[47:09] I won't tell you how old she is but
[47:12] she's a same age I
[47:15] am I can tell you how old I'll
[47:18] be
[47:21] 68 wow me and brother JD was telling
[47:24] that before service you just there's no
[47:27] way I have believed I'd ever Liv to be
[47:28] 68 years old there's no way I to believe
[47:31] the Lord would have delayed his coming
[47:34] for this period of years but I know this
[47:37] as long as I've got life and breath I'm
[47:39] going to do everything I can for him and
[47:41] for his
[47:43] people I trust youall feel the same way
[47:46] today God bless you let's read Isaiah
[47:53] 544 fear not
[47:57] for Thou shalt not be
[47:58] ashamed neither be thou confounded for
[48:01] Thou shalt not be put to
[48:04] shame for Thou shalt forget the shame of
[48:07] thy
[48:08] Youth and shall not remember the
[48:11] reproach of thy widowhood anymore for
[48:16] thy
[48:17] maker is thine
[48:19] husband the Lord of hosts is his name
[48:23] and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel
[48:26] the god of the whole
[48:27] Earth shall he be
[48:30] called and remember in
[48:32] reality he's not called that yet this is
[48:36] a prophecy that Isaiah gave of him that
[48:40] he will be called the god of the whole
[48:43] earth that's what we're longing for
[48:46] isn't
[48:47] it for the Lord has called thee as a
[48:51] woman
[48:53] forsaken grieved in spirit and
[48:57] wife of
[48:59] Youth grieved in spirit and a wife of
[49:03] use when thou was
[49:06] refused sayest thy God and he has a need
[49:11] today that you'd like to signify by the
[49:13] uplifting of your hand we'll take it
[49:14] before the
[49:16] Lord Lord Jesus as we stand before your
[49:19] people
[49:22] today I realize it's the greatest honor
[49:26] that a more could
[49:29] have what a great honor it would be to
[49:32] be able to address a king of a
[49:35] country even though we might differ with
[49:37] our president and his
[49:40] politics yet it would be an honor for us
[49:43] to be invited to go before him and talk
[49:46] with him it would be an honor for us to
[49:48] be invited and receive a personal
[49:50] invitation from the governor of
[49:52] Tennessee or some great person
[49:56] and yet Lord God we have an invitation
[49:59] from
[50:00] you and if a president wasn't there and
[50:03] the governor wasn't there to be able to
[50:06] speak to his wife what an honor that
[50:09] would be well sir until I get to see you
[50:13] that day I will continue this honor
[50:17] that's been extended to me for since a
[50:20] young boy you gave me the honor to
[50:24] preach your
[50:25] word to win souls to your kingdom to see
[50:29] people filled with the Holy
[50:31] Ghost to preach to them the evening
[50:34] light I consider it the highest honor of
[50:38] my entire life so once again we've
[50:41] gathered here today Lord and the lot has
[50:43] fallen upon
[50:45] me that I would be given a charge to try
[50:48] to bring something to your people to
[50:50] help them only you know what they all go
[50:53] through all that they face
[50:56] so I'm not here to tickle their ear as
[50:58] it was I'm not here to rebuke them as
[51:02] far as the human part I'm here to say
[51:05] something that would help them if that
[51:06] means correction if that means over an
[51:09] abundance of love and administration
[51:12] from your sovereignty then so be it you
[51:15] see our needs speak to us today Father
[51:18] we love you with all of our hearts in
[51:22] Jesus name amen you may be seated
[51:32] Isaiah is at
[51:34] the Prelude before
[51:38] God is going to divorce
[51:42] Israel by the time Jeremiah begins to
[51:46] prophesy he says where is the writing of
[51:50] thy mother's
[51:52] divorcement so Isaiah is there and
[51:56] there's still a period of
[51:57] Grace to where God is dealing with
[52:01] Israel and offering them that
[52:04] chance by which they can
[52:07] respond to his Grace Grace as we know is
[52:10] unmar favor something that we don't
[52:13] deserve something we could never do to
[52:16] buy it to purchase it any works we could
[52:18] ever do that God would say okay because
[52:20] you done this I'll give you this which
[52:22] is exactly where they were God Likens
[52:26] them to a young woman who had gotten
[52:30] married into a marriage of Shame a
[52:34] marriage of
[52:36] humiliation a marriage that had brought
[52:39] great bondage to her and God stepped in
[52:43] and his mercy and had redeemed her and
[52:47] by now she is already turning her back
[52:50] on him she has worshiped the gods of
[52:53] Moab
[52:55] Kos she has worshiped the gods of the
[52:58] ammonites the amorites the
[53:01] Hittites they brought their children
[53:04] before the
[53:06] idols and they would make these Idols
[53:08] out of
[53:09] bronze and they would leave them Hollow
[53:12] in the middle 9 to 10 foot tall big
[53:16] gigantic
[53:17] arms and they would build a fire inside
[53:21] of this Idol and whenever it got so hot
[53:26] that it would burn your
[53:28] flesh they would bring their children
[53:31] alive and lay them in the arms of that
[53:35] God because they believed it was a god
[53:38] or goddess of
[53:41] fertility so in order for them to have
[53:44] good crops good Vines good trees and
[53:49] their families to be able to bring forth
[53:52] they must
[53:53] sacrifice so they sacrific their
[53:56] children you imagine bringing your child
[53:58] your son your daughter and you're laying
[54:00] it in the arms of this image that the
[54:04] priest would have to hurriedly lay the
[54:07] child on there to keep from getting a
[54:09] burn on their own flesh because these
[54:13] Idols were so hot you say that's a bunch
[54:16] of
[54:16] heathens I'm not sure it's too much more
[54:19] Heathen than what a lot of our parents
[54:22] sacrifice their children to today amen
[54:24] they sacrifice it to rock and roll idols
[54:27] and all types of other Idols come on now
[54:30] don't get quiet on me already they they
[54:32] sacrifice their children to a lot of
[54:35] things that sacrificing has not stopped
[54:39] but I think we as Believers need to
[54:41] realize God has given to us an
[54:43] opportunity not to sacrifice our
[54:46] children to the idolatry of this age you
[54:50] parents say Amen to that because we know
[54:53] that God gives us the challenge but he
[54:56] also gives us the opportunity and the
[54:58] responsibility to bring up our children
[55:01] in the way which is pleasing to the Lord
[55:04] but Israel by this time now it's 700
[55:08] years or so BC whenever this is written
[55:11] seven he has quite a span there over
[55:14] which he prophesies in Isaiah 7:14 is
[55:16] course 712 Years BC so this is sometime
[55:20] after that so around 700 years or 695
[55:24] something like that BC and they already
[55:26] gotten worse by the time that God had
[55:29] given ahaz his sign in the Sund dial
[55:32] I'll let you read that historically so
[55:33] you can understand it in Isaiah chapter
[55:36] 7 so they went on a few more years and
[55:40] during that time they've got worse and
[55:42] worse and worse and God would always
[55:44] send the ministry of prophets deeding
[55:48] with Israel in the Old Testament now use
[55:50] judges of course in the dispensation
[55:52] when every man did write that which was
[55:55] right in his own eyes
[55:56] this is before God instituted the office
[56:00] of prophets and began with Samuel once
[56:03] God does and the people desire Kings not
[56:07] God's choice but the People's Choice and
[56:10] when you look at the first choice of
[56:12] King that God gives him and it was a man
[56:16] by the name of Saul a man that was
[56:18] rebellious stubborn hardheaded and you
[56:21] look at the leaders that are leading the
[56:24] nations of the world and you'll catch a
[56:27] pretty good glimpse of the people they
[56:31] are leading is it any Wonder we have
[56:35] such leadership in our nation
[56:38] today it is a
[56:41] reflection of the choice of the majority
[56:45] of the nation so what you see in the
[56:48] White House what you see in the Senate
[56:51] what you see in Congress what you see in
[56:54] the mayor's offices what you see seeing
[56:56] a lot of this and you say boy that's a
[56:58] sorry bunch of politicians but remember
[57:00] we are a democracy we vote them
[57:06] in well come on somebody so what is it
[57:09] these rotten people that we see running
[57:12] our country running our state running
[57:15] our positions of authority who is it
[57:17] that put them in there it is an element
[57:20] of the majority of the people why it
[57:23] suits their taste so their taste for a
[57:27] modern-day leader is a man that will do
[57:30] away with all sense of morality all
[57:34] sense of morality because they don't
[57:37] even know if they're women or men and
[57:39] they don't want people in there that can
[57:41] Divine and say there's only two Sexes
[57:45] they want people that'll say oh there's
[57:47] a whole bunch I mean today you can be a
[57:49] giraffe Kamar you can be a donkey I'm
[57:52] not too far from admitting that a
[57:54] donkey's got more sense than a lot of of
[57:56] our leaders do that's pretty evident I I
[57:59] think a lot of monkeys climbed up in a
[58:01] tree has got a whole lot more sense than
[58:03] the nation's leaders around the world
[58:05] Amen brother dnie at least a monkey but
[58:08] know he's a monkey well come on somebody
[58:11] you don't find no dog acting like he's a
[58:14] cat do you you find a rooster acting
[58:16] like he's a
[58:17] hen come on somebody you find a hen
[58:21] acting like she's a rooster no she got
[58:23] enough sense to know God made her in H
[58:26] shall always be a hen the rooster's got
[58:29] enough sense to know you don't find no
[58:30] rooster pulling his tail feathers out
[58:33] and taking the comb off and acting like
[58:35] he's some kind of dainty fied Little Hen
[58:38] and he's strutting around the hen house
[58:40] you don't find no transgender
[58:44] chickens well come on
[58:49] somebody you ever see a Brahma Bull out
[58:51] in the field and he takes his horns off
[58:54] and he tries to get rid of that pump on
[58:56] his back and he tries to you know act
[58:59] like a little woman as he's coming
[59:01] through them kind that Waits on us at
[59:03] the resturant what can I do for you what
[59:06] can I do for you today and you think
[59:08] bring me a bucket so I can
[59:11] barf oh you talking about making you
[59:14] sick to your stomach brother Donnie we
[59:17] need to love them I love their soul but
[59:19] I hate that homosexual devil that's on
[59:22] them
[59:26] well that's right praise the
[59:28] Lord and you see that's exactly where
[59:31] Israel had got to the spot and God
[59:34] reminded them of what he had done for
[59:37] them yet it had already arrived to the
[59:40] place of course God knew what they were
[59:41] going to do and by now God reminds them
[59:44] again of the state that he found them in
[59:47] I'd like to run a parallel for you and I
[59:48] today that the Lord found us in the same
[59:51] state so he passed by and Ezekiel talks
[59:55] about it many of you you aware of the
[59:56] scripture that it can be read many times
[59:59] and I've seen it myself and people are
[1:00:01] bleeding and if they have a profuse nose
[1:00:04] bleed or the a wound that will not stop
[1:00:07] and it's the the scripture in Ezekiel
[1:00:09] when he said I passed by thee and I saw
[1:00:11] thee and thy blood I've seen it over and
[1:00:14] over again that if people are bleeding
[1:00:16] and you read that scripture it's amazing
[1:00:18] that it'll stop and God reminded them of
[1:00:21] whenever he found them and they were
[1:00:24] they were not salted and reminds them of
[1:00:26] their birth and how he said that you
[1:00:28] were born and their birth was coming out
[1:00:31] of Egypt and he said you were not salted
[1:00:33] neither were you Supple now this was an
[1:00:35] ancient custom when a child was born
[1:00:37] they would dry the child off and then
[1:00:39] they would sprinkle salt on the child
[1:00:42] and rub the afterbirth and all that off
[1:00:44] of it and God said that you grew up as a
[1:00:47] young girl and and you were immature and
[1:00:49] your hair begin to grow and You Begin
[1:00:52] become a woman and God said when you did
[1:00:55] what you come to that marriageable age
[1:00:59] then what happened to you you started
[1:01:02] flirting with the world and giving the
[1:01:04] world yourself and the Bible can be
[1:01:06] quite plain and how it describes such
[1:01:09] things and God goes on to say that you
[1:01:12] sat by the wayside and you opened up
[1:01:14] your legs to every man that would come
[1:01:17] by now remember this is the way that
[1:01:19] Israel treated God and God finally got
[1:01:23] to the place to where he said no more
[1:01:25] are you my wife now by the time Malachi
[1:01:29] comes on the earth and he prophesies and
[1:01:32] he says that God is going to Smite the
[1:01:34] Earth with a curse unless he sins an
[1:01:37] Elijah anointing now remember God has
[1:01:40] different
[1:01:41] dispensational anointings that he used
[1:01:44] in different days when God got ready to
[1:01:46] destroy and bring an end to deluvian
[1:01:49] destruction upon the Earth there was a
[1:01:51] special Angel which had power over the
[1:01:54] waters but remember remember the waters
[1:01:57] it wasn't just that the waters come down
[1:01:59] out of the sky but the Bible tells us
[1:02:02] The Fountains of the deep broke open now
[1:02:06] we know that there's great they found
[1:02:08] them many many years ago there's great
[1:02:10] great containing elements that are in
[1:02:13] the earth that holds billions and
[1:02:16] billions of gallons of water and it's
[1:02:20] the water table as we call it and
[1:02:23] whenever the spirit of God begin to move
[1:02:25] upon the Earth and the rain started
[1:02:27] coming down this way The Fountains of
[1:02:30] the deep the water table be to open up
[1:02:34] and gush out of the very heart of the
[1:02:37] earth now remember God put it there
[1:02:39] around the core so that it would keep
[1:02:42] the Earth from exploding because the
[1:02:44] Earth's Soul come from the Sun so there
[1:02:48] was a clinker that shot off the Sun and
[1:02:51] from there come the Earth what is the
[1:02:53] very core of the Earth and the
[1:02:56] scientists are saying now that the core
[1:02:58] of course of the Earth turns in the
[1:02:59] opposite direction by that it creates a
[1:03:01] revolutionary something and how it spins
[1:03:04] so they're saying now that in the last
[1:03:06] few years that the core of the Earth has
[1:03:09] actually slowed down and they're really
[1:03:12] concerned because of what's going on on
[1:03:14] the earth and I read that and I think
[1:03:16] yeah it's like the the inhabitants of
[1:03:19] the earth that their soul also is of a
[1:03:23] different nature it's going in a
[1:03:25] different direction and you imagine if
[1:03:27] it was not for all this water there in
[1:03:30] the very heart of the earth which goes
[1:03:32] around the so or the core of the Earth
[1:03:34] how hot this place would be and The
[1:03:37] Fountains of the deep begin to break up
[1:03:39] and there was great gushers that come
[1:03:41] out of the earth so the rain was coming
[1:03:44] this way 40 days and 40 nights and as it
[1:03:47] was coming this way The Fountains of the
[1:03:49] deep so what was it that which was an
[1:03:52] invisible force began to pour out in the
[1:03:56] and deluvian destruction I want you to
[1:03:58] keep in mind now Demons of hell are
[1:04:02] pouring in every direction also the
[1:04:06] prince of the power of the air now
[1:04:08] remember what Satan is him and his
[1:04:11] demons his Legions of evil spirits have
[1:04:15] access to the sphere above us also the
[1:04:19] sphere beneath us and the prophet said
[1:04:21] there was three Realms this way and
[1:04:23] three Realms this way and you and I are
[1:04:26] caught in the middle every day we're
[1:04:29] under the influence of those Realms
[1:04:31] that's why we can have good thoughts bad
[1:04:34] thoughts that's why we can have good
[1:04:36] things to happen to us and bad things to
[1:04:38] happen to us because we're caught right
[1:04:41] in the middle of these three spheres the
[1:04:45] anian destruction would never have
[1:04:48] happened on the scale that it did had
[1:04:51] not this power had broke up The
[1:04:54] Fountains of the deep what kept it there
[1:04:56] well if you go back to Genesis 1 and you
[1:04:59] read how that in the beginning God
[1:05:01] created the heavens and the Earth and
[1:05:03] the Earth was without form and void and
[1:05:06] darkness covered the face of the deep
[1:05:08] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[1:05:10] waters and God said let there be light
[1:05:13] and we go on and on and on one day of
[1:05:15] creation which seeks 1,000 years and he
[1:05:18] he come to a spot then the Bible says
[1:05:20] the Waters of the heavens were gathered
[1:05:22] in one place called a firmament now
[1:05:25] firmament is a gathering together of a
[1:05:28] mass of bodies that are of a similar
[1:05:32] genos of a similar kind so there was a
[1:05:36] firmament in the heaven and then there
[1:05:38] was a firmament on the earth so there
[1:05:41] was Waters that was gathered in the
[1:05:43] heaven what was that water it was what
[1:05:45] we know as water vapor which will make
[1:05:48] clouds storms and so on but then there
[1:05:51] was a great Gathering of the waters and
[1:05:53] they were gathered where they were were
[1:05:55] gathered beneath the surface not the
[1:05:57] visible part of lakes rivers and streams
[1:06:00] but it's these great massive bodies of
[1:06:03] water that are in the earth the
[1:06:05] destruction was coming near and we could
[1:06:08] tell that it was going to be an
[1:06:11] Annihilation because what was bouting up
[1:06:14] out of the Earth is going to Aid in the
[1:06:19] destruction when God will allow demon
[1:06:22] spirits and God will allow the people on
[1:06:26] the Earth to become so oh so immoral and
[1:06:30] so rotten that they begin to take on
[1:06:34] demonic looks they will begin to take on
[1:06:38] demonic traits and characteristics they
[1:06:42] will begin to imerge themselves into
[1:06:46] that penetration of the evil in an
[1:06:49] Unseen World it is a sign another
[1:06:53] Annihilation is coming now remember when
[1:06:56] all hell breaks loose all Heaven comes
[1:07:01] down so it's like they're synchronized
[1:07:03] together so God has sent little revivals
[1:07:06] down through the age and by little I
[1:07:09] don't mean that it's not a great move of
[1:07:11] God but it would be smaller than say a a
[1:07:15] destruction which is going to come in a
[1:07:17] major way so Wars also are parallel with
[1:07:22] the revivals that God would send upon
[1:07:24] the Earth it must have been a terrible
[1:07:27] time in that anti deluvian time that the
[1:07:30] people of the earth started taking on a
[1:07:34] remarkable likeness like the Nether
[1:07:38] world which they had never seen and they
[1:07:41] began to become more evil and the Bible
[1:07:43] goes on to say that the imagination of
[1:07:46] man's heart was continually on evil so
[1:07:49] every day all they thought was evil and
[1:07:52] rotness and no good mean and and how
[1:07:55] they could corrupt this and violence and
[1:07:58] remember one of the signs of the end
[1:08:00] time according to the Book of Genesis
[1:08:02] was violence now look at where we are
[1:08:05] many of our major cities the violence
[1:08:08] how it has increased in our day praise
[1:08:11] the Lord you remember it's not been just
[1:08:13] a year or two ago to when a lot of our
[1:08:15] politicians were wanting to abolish our
[1:08:19] police force you say are are are you are
[1:08:21] you people in your right mind you want
[1:08:24] to get rid of the very people who will
[1:08:26] try to protect us and be able you
[1:08:29] understand that our police force they're
[1:08:31] having the hardest time all over our
[1:08:34] nation to even get people that will come
[1:08:37] and work for the police force because
[1:08:40] they think it does no good you go out
[1:08:42] and arrest the criminals and they're out
[1:08:45] of they're out under a bond or Bond free
[1:08:48] quicker than it took them to book them
[1:08:50] and read them The Veranda rights and
[1:08:52] they've got to go through all that
[1:08:53] process and these liberal judges and
[1:08:56] these liberal bunch of politicians and
[1:08:59] prosecutors and so on come on now don't
[1:09:01] get quiet on me don't you see what it is
[1:09:05] hell is vomiting its influence upon the
[1:09:09] Earth and then you turn around on the
[1:09:12] other side and you look at what a
[1:09:14] miracle that God is doing on the Earth
[1:09:17] by a people who do not feel at home in
[1:09:20] this world anymore and then we see
[1:09:23] people who walk away from the light of
[1:09:25] the day and we watch how they corrupt
[1:09:29] and how fast they will corrupt and you
[1:09:31] know it as well as I do for those of you
[1:09:33] that's had family members that's been
[1:09:35] raised in the message or maybe even come
[1:09:36] to our church and they got away from God
[1:09:39] and it's like within a month's time with
[1:09:41] two months time and six months time you
[1:09:43] don't even know them and I find it
[1:09:46] amazing because as I've looked at people
[1:09:48] do that over the years and you watch
[1:09:51] even their physical countenance that
[1:09:54] they will begin to take on a different
[1:09:56] look and sin Demands a great price and
[1:10:01] if you're a seed of God God will haunt
[1:10:03] you every day until you come back to
[1:10:06] your place but at the same time those
[1:10:09] that are not his he is not haunting him
[1:10:13] them but it is rather the demons out of
[1:10:16] hell and remember demons are like the
[1:10:19] angels of God they're almost helpless
[1:10:20] without human beings to work through so
[1:10:23] it must have been a terrible time in
[1:10:25] this and deluvian destruction that the
[1:10:27] people on the Earth you imagine people
[1:10:29] that was living now several hundred
[1:10:31] years old during this time and they
[1:10:34] would live that lifetime what a change
[1:10:36] they've seen so as as I said I'll be 68
[1:10:39] years old the things that I've seen in
[1:10:41] my lifetime are unbelievable now we got
[1:10:44] people here in their 80s some close to
[1:10:46] their 90s you imagine what they've seen
[1:10:49] in their lifetime how that the world has
[1:10:51] gone down further and further is that
[1:10:54] true for some of you old people some of
[1:10:56] you young younger people would you
[1:10:58] thought You' ever see in your lifespan
[1:11:00] brother Paul some of the things that you
[1:11:03] have seen brother Maddy what you've seen
[1:11:05] in your life and look at where we are
[1:11:07] you think how is it getting worse it's
[1:11:10] because the lid has been tore off of
[1:11:13] hell and them demon powers are streaming
[1:11:17] in every direction oh he said brother
[1:11:19] Donnie that scares me you have no reason
[1:11:21] to be scared unless you don't have the
[1:11:23] Holy Ghost now if you don't have the
[1:11:25] Holy Ghost you better be scared stiff
[1:11:29] because I'm telling you you're not going
[1:11:31] to be able to make it in this day
[1:11:33] without the holy ghost coming to this
[1:11:36] church is not enough saying you believe
[1:11:39] the message is not enough brother Donnie
[1:11:42] I respect you that's not enough I
[1:11:45] respect God's Prophet that's not enough
[1:11:47] you've got to have a power in you that
[1:11:51] is greater than these demons out of hell
[1:11:54] that we are dealing
[1:11:57] with now remember it's never been quite
[1:12:00] like this before what we are dealing
[1:12:03] with and God out of this age is going to
[1:12:07] present to himself the capping of all
[1:12:11] the church ages and he would choose the
[1:12:14] very worst age of all to bring the
[1:12:18] Capstone he would wait until the very
[1:12:22] last moments of time until man had got
[1:12:26] to such a place that he was beyond
[1:12:28] Redemption our nation is beyond
[1:12:31] Redemption I don't care who gets in the
[1:12:33] White House in November I don't care who
[1:12:35] wins the election we are Beyond
[1:12:39] Redemption America turned down her
[1:12:42] chance in
[1:12:43] 1956 and she's gone downhill ever since
[1:12:47] we could have a Abraham Lincoln we could
[1:12:49] have whoever you think was a great
[1:12:51] politician in every state and it is
[1:12:54] beyond Redemption let me go ahead and
[1:12:56] say it the majority of the churches are
[1:12:58] the same way and God is not calling this
[1:13:01] denomination that denomination this
[1:13:04] church that church but God is calling
[1:13:07] individuals God is calling men women
[1:13:10] boys and girls who are willing to come
[1:13:13] under the influence of Heaven
[1:13:17] itself in order to do this there must be
[1:13:21] the releasing of a supernatural
[1:13:24] anointing
[1:13:26] which will bring the bride to a place of
[1:13:30] climax Luther did not need it listen to
[1:13:34] me carefully now Paul in his age now if
[1:13:37] you'll follow the timeline of the way
[1:13:40] when Paul gets converted and he starts
[1:13:42] preaching and Paul would write some of
[1:13:45] his first letters in Luke of course the
[1:13:47] author of the book of Acts and he would
[1:13:49] begin to write some of it and begin to
[1:13:51] write down some of the sermons that Paul
[1:13:53] preached and you can here Paul as he
[1:13:56] starts out that Paul actually believed
[1:13:59] and thought that the coming of the Lord
[1:14:02] Jesus would be in his generation but as
[1:14:06] the time went on you hear Paul and the
[1:14:10] Revelation began to become more clear to
[1:14:12] him that he recognized the coming of the
[1:14:15] Lord was not going to happen in his
[1:14:17] lifetime and you watch the volumes of
[1:14:20] these writings how the Holy Spirit began
[1:14:23] to change how wanted to anoint the
[1:14:26] people for the present time you see this
[1:14:28] is what God wants us to be God wants us
[1:14:31] to be charged for the present but
[1:14:35] changed for the future charged for the
[1:14:39] present but changed for the future God
[1:14:42] don't want us sitting around twiddling
[1:14:44] our th waiting waiting waiting well the
[1:14:46] last five minutes before the Rapture I'm
[1:14:48] going to get on fire with God you'll be
[1:14:50] of no benefit the years that you're here
[1:14:52] while you're waiting for that if you
[1:14:53] have that attitude but God wants us to
[1:14:56] be charged stay charged full charged
[1:14:59] praise the Lord uh you brothers that
[1:15:01] operate battery operated tools or a
[1:15:03] blower or whatever it is ain't it so
[1:15:05] aggravating whenever you get ready to
[1:15:07] blow your yard or this and that and the
[1:15:09] other whatever you're going to do you
[1:15:10] you just need to cut one board one one
[1:15:14] by6 board and you grab your favorite
[1:15:17] battery powered saw and you pick it up
[1:15:19] and you pull the trigger and it's As
[1:15:22] Dead As a hammer well that's the way it
[1:15:23] is sometimes with Christians they're a
[1:15:26] DeWalt Christian they're a Makita
[1:15:28] Christian RI Christian they look like it
[1:15:32] they're the right color they've got the
[1:15:34] brand name and you go to pick them up
[1:15:36] for something you push the button and
[1:15:38] they just sat there they don't move they
[1:15:40] don't turn they don't wiggle they don't
[1:15:41] squirm they don't do nothing but what
[1:15:44] God wants is fully charged Christians so
[1:15:48] it's the Lord needs you today this
[1:15:50] evening tomorrow tomorrow afternoon if
[1:15:53] the Lord picks you up that he can put
[1:15:56] his finger on your trigger and you're
[1:15:58] ready to deliver whatever God wants so
[1:16:02] he wants us charg for the present but
[1:16:05] change for the future so that we stay
[1:16:08] fully charged while we're going toward
[1:16:10] our great Heavenly home but at the same
[1:16:13] time we are planning for it living for
[1:16:16] it I'm going to make plans as if though
[1:16:18] I'm going to live to be 75 or 80 years
[1:16:20] old or 90 or whatever but I am going to
[1:16:22] live every moment of my life as if
[1:16:25] though it were my last moment cuz it
[1:16:27] might be is that right now when God goes
[1:16:30] to dealing with this then you can watch
[1:16:33] them as they parallel and it's like when
[1:16:36] Moses begin to write in Genesis 1 and
[1:16:40] then he put a a span of time a space of
[1:16:43] time in between the time that the Earth
[1:16:45] starts being brought into an existence
[1:16:48] and we can read in Jeremiah as well
[1:16:49] whenever he looked at the Earth by
[1:16:51] vision and he saw the Earth that it was
[1:16:53] in this dark and chaos God would have
[1:16:55] never made the Earth and left it like
[1:16:57] that and God would have never left it in
[1:16:59] such a state of chaos but it's like
[1:17:01] something happened to the Earth the
[1:17:03] Primeval State as it's called the
[1:17:06] Primeval state of the earth and by the
[1:17:08] time God anoints Moses to be able to
[1:17:11] write it's like something had already
[1:17:13] happened catastrophic and it had brought
[1:17:16] the Earth in this state and it looked
[1:17:18] like an absolute total chaos and then
[1:17:21] God begins to move again remember the
[1:17:23] prophet said when God said you know
[1:17:25] these seeds let these seeds come and
[1:17:27] those seeds come even said about let
[1:17:29] there be light he said the sun and the
[1:17:31] moon and the stars were already in
[1:17:33] existence he was not creating them
[1:17:36] originally they had already been created
[1:17:38] but remember as God did to the Earth the
[1:17:41] Earth was your mother so the Earth was
[1:17:44] the type of you so the Earth was
[1:17:46] signifying the way you would be brought
[1:17:49] whenever you were given birth in this
[1:17:51] life you would be brought out of that
[1:17:53] dismal dark stage of sin and Chaos that
[1:17:57] you were in and yet there's something in
[1:17:59] every human being with a soul they're
[1:18:01] searching for something they're looking
[1:18:03] for something they may wound up
[1:18:05] believing taism they may wind up
[1:18:07] believing shintu ISM they may wind up
[1:18:10] being an all types of different religion
[1:18:12] they may believe in reincarnation they
[1:18:14] might be a Hindu they might even be a
[1:18:16] church member whatever denomination that
[1:18:18] it will be because there's something in
[1:18:19] them that hungers but God desires to do
[1:18:22] to us the same thing that he did to the
[1:18:25] Earth so when he catches Moses up and
[1:18:27] it's like Moses breaks in on a stage of
[1:18:30] the creation of God after a great
[1:18:33] catastrophe or something has happened
[1:18:35] the pre-adamite world and when something
[1:18:38] the Earth was in that state and then God
[1:18:41] allows him to go back and the spirit of
[1:18:43] God begins to move and he begins to
[1:18:46] divide the firmament and place the
[1:18:48] waters here and place the waters beneath
[1:18:50] the Earth and he gathers the waters now
[1:18:52] you see this is what God does and God
[1:18:54] divided the light from the darkness now
[1:18:57] before it was all this mass of Darkness
[1:19:00] covered the Earth but what was light the
[1:19:02] light was gathering the light into a
[1:19:06] dispensation and separating the
[1:19:08] dispensation of Darkness from the
[1:19:11] dispensation of light and the evening
[1:19:14] and the morning were the first day and
[1:19:16] then we go to the second day and you
[1:19:18] found the same thing right on down the
[1:19:20] evening and the morning I want you to
[1:19:21] notice the way the Bible writes this
[1:19:23] that it does not say say and the morning
[1:19:25] and the evening were the first day but
[1:19:28] the evening and the morning now if you
[1:19:29] know the Jewish calendar and the way
[1:19:31] they keep their time you know that the
[1:19:33] way they look at it that the new day
[1:19:35] actually will begin later on in the
[1:19:38] evening so in the evening that's why the
[1:19:41] Bible says it and the evening and the
[1:19:43] morning were the first day so in Sundown
[1:19:47] Shabbat would begin on Friday afternoon
[1:19:50] so late Friday afternoon when the Sun
[1:19:52] goes down that is the evening so the
[1:19:55] evening signifies the birth of a new day
[1:19:59] now as westerners the way we look at it
[1:20:02] we look at the sun coming up in the
[1:20:04] morning and we say well that's the start
[1:20:06] of the new day no that's not exactly the
[1:20:09] start of the new day actually that it
[1:20:11] starts at that way we look at it
[1:20:12] westerners it's
[1:20:14] 12:01 a.m. so you got midnight which is
[1:20:17] p.m. right and then whenever the clock
[1:20:20] goes past that till it comes to 12:01
[1:20:23] what is it it's a brand new day and yet
[1:20:26] it is total darkness on the outside so
[1:20:30] the new day can begin though it looks
[1:20:34] like it's still a darkened chaos I hope
[1:20:37] God helps me today to help you to see we
[1:20:40] have already moved into a new day amen
[1:20:45] now there's Darkness all around us
[1:20:47] everywhere there's sin there's
[1:20:48] debauchery filthiness absolutely
[1:20:50] unbelievable time that we're living in
[1:20:53] but we've already moved into
[1:20:56] 12:01 a.m. so the way we are looking at
[1:21:00] it it's simply the last stages of the
[1:21:03] darkness before the sun comes up now
[1:21:07] what are we looking for we're looking
[1:21:09] for the Millennium what will the sunrise
[1:21:12] be the sunrise will be the dawn of the
[1:21:15] Millennium when the son of David will
[1:21:18] come and Rain upon the earth now
[1:21:20] remember God chose three dispensations
[1:21:23] under the title son son of God Son of
[1:21:27] Man son of David now Jesus himself
[1:21:31] identified himself and he referred to
[1:21:34] himself both ways of course Son of God
[1:21:36] and son of man so what is Son of God the
[1:21:39] great spirit God remember God is not a
[1:21:42] man but God is a spirit so the spirit
[1:21:45] God gave birth to the part of himself
[1:21:49] which could become manifested or visible
[1:21:53] now in that realm the invisible God
[1:21:55] could never be seen by any of us none of
[1:21:59] us as a matter of fact God's Prophet
[1:22:01] said God has never been seen and never
[1:22:06] will so what will we behold even on the
[1:22:10] throne of the Millennium what will we
[1:22:12] behold in the Eighth Day When Jesus our
[1:22:16] Joseph was set on the throne and then
[1:22:18] the father will be that light that great
[1:22:21] shik of Glory around him remember God is
[1:22:23] not a man God is a spirit so God has to
[1:22:27] step out of that glory to take on a
[1:22:30] manifestation to where we able to even
[1:22:33] know it so then when we look at the
[1:22:36] destruction God anointed a man by the
[1:22:39] name of Noah and gave him a message to
[1:22:42] tell him something is fixing to happen
[1:22:45] and Noah responded to that message now I
[1:22:48] realize people saying well what
[1:22:49] difference does it make if you preach
[1:22:51] this that the other it don't make no
[1:22:52] difference oh but it does so what if
[1:22:56] Noah would have preached Moses message
[1:22:59] and Noah would have said tell you what
[1:23:01] we're all going to come out of the land
[1:23:03] of Egypt and we're going to go up here
[1:23:05] somewhere in Assyria and we're going to
[1:23:07] go up a high mountain up there and we're
[1:23:09] all just going to come out of the land
[1:23:10] of Egypt and that that that's exactly
[1:23:12] what we're going to do Noah would have
[1:23:14] perished with the rest of the earth so
[1:23:16] with the animals so dispensation it's so
[1:23:20] important to find the message for the
[1:23:23] time you're living you understand that's
[1:23:25] where a lot of the conflict is coming
[1:23:27] right now and has been for several years
[1:23:29] around the message dispensation trying
[1:23:32] to identify what should we be focusing
[1:23:35] on right now in 2024 what should the
[1:23:39] message preachers be preaching now let
[1:23:41] me just tell you this I'm sure you know
[1:23:43] it already but every preacher is not a
[1:23:46] man of God come
[1:23:48] on no more than every Christian is a
[1:23:53] saint there are many Christians that are
[1:23:56] not Saints some of the people you work
[1:23:59] with that you say are good people they
[1:24:02] may be Christians and saved but it don't
[1:24:05] mean they're saints Saints come from the
[1:24:08] Greek word
[1:24:09] Sanctified and you can have a look at at
[1:24:12] them they certainly ain't Sanctified so
[1:24:14] a person could be a Christian and not be
[1:24:17] Sanctified so a preacher can be a
[1:24:20] preacher but it doesn't mean he's a man
[1:24:23] of God he wants to preach he studies to
[1:24:27] preach and he thinks he's a preach you
[1:24:29] know some some men are just good
[1:24:31] salesman and then they confuse it and
[1:24:34] think they're called to be a preacher
[1:24:36] they could talk the leg off of his Jack
[1:24:37] Rabbit they could sell an Eskimo a whole
[1:24:40] rower of refrigerators and deep freezers
[1:24:43] why because they've got The Gift of Gab
[1:24:45] they think it's the gift of the Holy
[1:24:47] Ghost to call them the preach come on
[1:24:49] somebody and yet there's many many
[1:24:52] preachers we of course look at the
[1:24:53] denomination ranks out here many of them
[1:24:55] that are not God call men they are
[1:24:57] preachers but they're not men of God I'm
[1:25:00] convinced myself in the ranks of the
[1:25:02] message that there's many in our own
[1:25:04] ranks that are preachers but they're not
[1:25:07] necessarily men of God so they will
[1:25:10] build a kingdom look at their Doctrine
[1:25:13] Prophet said a man says he's called to
[1:25:14] be a teacher watch how he interprets the
[1:25:17] word so if he interprets a word that
[1:25:19] there's three Gods you know right there
[1:25:21] God never called that man he's not a man
[1:25:24] of God God he might be a preacher but
[1:25:26] he's not a man of God a man of God is
[1:25:29] those now listen to me a preacher
[1:25:31] doesn't necessarily have to be a man of
[1:25:34] God but a man of God will have to be a
[1:25:37] preacher you see when God calls a man of
[1:25:41] God he is a man of God before he ever
[1:25:44] becomes a preacher in that sense he's
[1:25:47] gifted there God's given to him whenever
[1:25:48] he was born and yet he will bring forth
[1:25:52] and capture the light of the day now if
[1:25:55] he's a messenger of the age God will
[1:25:56] give it to him and then out from under
[1:25:59] him will go the ministry of others who
[1:26:01] have been Faithfully taught and then
[1:26:04] they will go out and when they get out
[1:26:06] on their own and they'll have their
[1:26:08] Evangelistic Ministry their Mission
[1:26:10] Ministry their pastorial Ministry or
[1:26:12] whatever they are they will remember how
[1:26:15] important it is to say only what the
[1:26:18] messenger is spoken but alas many of
[1:26:20] them will not then they will get a
[1:26:23] following and they'll get a agenda and
[1:26:25] then they'll want a bigger following and
[1:26:26] a bigger following so they do what do
[1:26:28] they have to do to compromise to where
[1:26:30] that it will draw the attention away
[1:26:32] from the mouthpiece of the age
[1:26:35] especially if that mouthpiece is gone
[1:26:37] and then they become the mouthpiece and
[1:26:40] then everybody's supposed to look at
[1:26:42] them how many have we had well you see
[1:26:45] that's not a man of God that's a
[1:26:48] preacher so we don't want to be I don't
[1:26:51] want to just be a preacher why better
[1:26:53] any the rest of you preachers here today
[1:26:54] any of you preachers you just want to be
[1:26:56] a preacher don't you want to be a man of
[1:26:58] God what about you Christians y'all just
[1:27:00] want to be a Christian or do you want to
[1:27:03] be a saint oh yeah how many wants to be
[1:27:07] a saint you see only those according to
[1:27:10] the Book of Revelation that will walk
[1:27:14] with him in white because they are
[1:27:18] worthy we look at it Wednesday night
[1:27:19] Lord willing they will walk with him in
[1:27:22] white because they are worthy that's
[1:27:25] Saints
[1:27:27] identification Sanctified by his
[1:27:30] presence Washed by the Regeneration and
[1:27:33] the water of the word so they are not
[1:27:35] just saved they're not just Christians
[1:27:38] but they're Sanctified to him Sanctified
[1:27:42] him what brother Donnie to be his wife
[1:27:44] as I've told you before the vows that
[1:27:47] many of the Jews said some of them still
[1:27:48] say it this way be thou Sanctified so a
[1:27:51] man's going to take a wife and they
[1:27:53] don't will thou take this woman as we
[1:27:56] westerners do but it's very simple to
[1:27:58] them and he will say to the woman be
[1:28:00] thou Sanctified unto me according to the
[1:28:04] law of Moses and of Israel be thou
[1:28:09] Sanctified unto me according to the law
[1:28:12] of Moses and of Israel so what that man
[1:28:15] is saying is that you will not have any
[1:28:18] other boyfriends you will not be kissing
[1:28:21] any other man you will not become the
[1:28:23] best setting ground for any other man's
[1:28:26] seed but you will be Sanctified for me
[1:28:30] and me alone you will be my fellowship
[1:28:34] alone you see God gave Eve to Adam for
[1:28:38] what for fellowship and reproduction of
[1:28:42] his own kind how did the devil mess her
[1:28:44] up fellowship and reproduction so she
[1:28:48] started fellowshipping with somebody
[1:28:50] else that started adding to the word
[1:28:54] well you know God does know that that
[1:28:56] you're living in the last age and my if
[1:28:58] you just stand up there and preach that
[1:29:00] message in full strength you're going to
[1:29:02] run people off so I thinking about it
[1:29:05] before I come to church that's the
[1:29:06] mentality of some of our preachers in
[1:29:08] the message is that whenever you go to
[1:29:11] getting in new people that you stop
[1:29:13] preaching your sermon so this thought
[1:29:16] come to me and I just thought it was
[1:29:17] absolutely awesome so you parents that
[1:29:21] have had babies come to your family and
[1:29:24] say you've got a mama and a daddy and
[1:29:26] you've got a 13-year-old boy 13-y old
[1:29:28] girl whichever it is and then all of the
[1:29:30] sudden you have a baby this morning into
[1:29:32] your family I was wondering how many of
[1:29:36] you parents then because your baby
[1:29:39] started sucking a bottle and drinking
[1:29:42] milk only I was wondering how many of
[1:29:45] your parents changed the diet of the
[1:29:49] whole
[1:29:50] family to match the baby it
[1:29:57] amen don't you see Satan one of his
[1:30:00] greatest tricks is to try to start
[1:30:03] sending supposed interested people into
[1:30:06] a mature light of the word and then the
[1:30:09] preacher will start pulling back pulling
[1:30:12] back pulling back oh I'm just preaching
[1:30:14] for the babies I'm preaching for the new
[1:30:16] ones now you apply that same practice
[1:30:18] right when you get a newborn in your
[1:30:20] house and then when you all went to the
[1:30:22] table you've got a new baby in the house
[1:30:24] so brother Rob and sister way Sister
[1:30:26] Sarah done you that after your firstborn
[1:30:29] son come along and then your daughter
[1:30:30] start coming along and then whenever
[1:30:32] they was on a bottle brother rob you
[1:30:34] also had a bottle right and Sister Sarah
[1:30:36] had a bottle and then the children were
[1:30:38] used to eating mac and cheese and you
[1:30:40] know whatever they enjoyed eating so you
[1:30:42] Chang the diet of the whole family
[1:30:45] because you've got a
[1:30:47] newborn well why do preachers do it why
[1:30:51] do preachers when they see a new face
[1:30:53] attack two and say oh I've got to cut
[1:30:55] back I I I can't mention nothing about
[1:30:57] brother brand you know don't you know I
[1:30:59] I I I know of preachers that have told
[1:31:02] people preachers coming to their church
[1:31:04] now don't don't read no quotes and and
[1:31:06] don't mention the name of the Prophet
[1:31:08] you know don't don't don't do
[1:31:10] that that's a man that's not supposed to
[1:31:13] be in leadership on because he's
[1:31:16] treating everybody in the church as if
[1:31:19] they are a newborn we've got some saints
[1:31:21] setting here that have been eating
[1:31:24] mature food for decades then what kind
[1:31:28] of knead would I be to put everybody on
[1:31:31] a bottle because we have visitors coming
[1:31:34] in don't you know what Satan would do he
[1:31:37] would put visitors here every service if
[1:31:41] I start complying to that rule but
[1:31:44] there's one rule I comply to it's the
[1:31:47] rule of God and the Lord Jesus told
[1:31:51] Peter don't just feed the Lambs
[1:31:54] but feed the sheep well come on somebody
[1:31:58] but you see in order to find the
[1:32:01] identification of where we are and the
[1:32:05] emphasis that we put on in the time that
[1:32:07] we're in so here we are there's two
[1:32:10] great mergings together in the Earth the
[1:32:12] prince of the power of darkness and his
[1:32:15] demons has been released in the
[1:32:17] political world what we see in amas
[1:32:19] looks like Hezbollah is fixing to start
[1:32:21] a war from the north already hundreds
[1:32:23] and hundreds of missiles that are
[1:32:25] hitting Israel every day and remember
[1:32:28] Hezbollah is estimated to have over
[1:32:35] 150,000 rockets and
[1:32:38] missiles Hamas is nothing compared to
[1:32:43] Hezbollah and what is the world doing
[1:32:46] they're still boycotting Israel on the
[1:32:50] 4th of July in Philadelphia in New York
[1:32:54] and major cities of America these Pro
[1:32:58] Palestinian groups met they burned our
[1:33:02] US
[1:33:03] flag and they flew Palestinian
[1:33:07] flags and they curs
[1:33:11] America and these are supposedly
[1:33:13] American citizens don't you see don't
[1:33:16] you see it's an exact parallel of what
[1:33:18] Isaiah was dealing with years and years
[1:33:19] ago that our nation that was supposedly
[1:33:22] founded on the principles of God but
[1:33:25] does our nation want God anymore as a
[1:33:28] whole of course they don't what do they
[1:33:31] want whatever the people want let them
[1:33:33] have it brother renom talked about that
[1:33:36] whenever he was here in the 60s and he
[1:33:38] said where is our Patrick hris where are
[1:33:43] those people that will stand for what we
[1:33:45] are and yet the politicians they will
[1:33:48] stand for it until it comes election
[1:33:50] year and then they have to kind of be
[1:33:53] careful of what they're saying you're
[1:33:54] looking at the news just like I am
[1:33:57] you're looking at it on your phone and
[1:33:59] on YouTube and whatever more and you're
[1:34:01] reading it and you're watching how
[1:34:03] they're Kinder be careful you know do we
[1:34:05] go lean toward the Democrats do we lean
[1:34:07] toward the Republicans you know
[1:34:08] everybody's getting kind of worried
[1:34:10] about Biden I just find it amazing they
[1:34:12] just found it out you think about what a
[1:34:15] bunch of nuts we've got in this public
[1:34:18] they are they are surprised by this are
[1:34:20] you kidding me where have you been for
[1:34:22] the last 13 months or 14 months or 3
[1:34:25] years where what what planet have you
[1:34:28] been vacating on it must been Neptune or
[1:34:31] Mars or Pluto somewhere that you don't
[1:34:34] realize where we are don't you see how
[1:34:36] deceptive the people are we've got a man
[1:34:39] in the White House poor God I feel sorry
[1:34:41] for them it's no longer funny it's
[1:34:42] pitiful and yet what have them people
[1:34:44] done they protected it and hid it and
[1:34:47] would have done it again they would have
[1:34:49] done it again because they care more
[1:34:52] about their politics than they care
[1:34:54] about this nation they don't love
[1:34:56] America come on somebody they don't love
[1:34:59] God they don't love his word I'm afraid
[1:35:02] friends if we're not careful the same
[1:35:04] thing is going to hit the message of the
[1:35:06] hour that people are going to be at the
[1:35:09] spot they really don't love the message
[1:35:11] they really don't love what it stands
[1:35:13] for they love what it can do for them
[1:35:17] what can the message do for them let me
[1:35:20] use the message as a springboard that I
[1:35:23] can get a among the message people go
[1:35:25] ahead you thief and you'll stand before
[1:35:27] God and be judged oh my I I don't want
[1:35:30] to just see what can the message do for
[1:35:32] me how can I be benefited by being
[1:35:35] around the message but I want to say
[1:35:37] what can I do what can I do to bring the
[1:35:40] word What About It Word of Life we don't
[1:35:43] want to just say well what can Word of
[1:35:45] Life do for me how can they benefit me
[1:35:47] what can I get out of going there reckon
[1:35:50] I could be this or be that my it ought
[1:35:52] to be the desire of your heart to say
[1:35:55] Lord let me do whatever I can do to help
[1:35:58] a brother or a sister the sick The
[1:36:00] Afflicted the sad the lonely the weary
[1:36:03] Lord help me to do something to minister
[1:36:06] back to the body of
[1:36:14] Christ oh my listen this the prophet
[1:36:18] said Jesus was God in
[1:36:21] flesh and if Jesus
[1:36:25] is in you
[1:36:26] tonight it's still God manifest himself
[1:36:30] in the last
[1:36:34] days the son of
[1:36:37] man revealing
[1:36:40] himself in his
[1:36:45] church don't let that stagger
[1:36:49] you the son of man revealing himself in
[1:36:53] his body
[1:36:54] body before the
[1:36:56] Rapture is a
[1:36:58] Prelude to the son of
[1:37:01] predition revealing himself in his
[1:37:06] body in the tribulation
[1:37:09] period Do you believe the son of
[1:37:12] predition will be revealed who will it
[1:37:14] be
[1:37:15] Satan
[1:37:17] himself in a human being where did he
[1:37:19] get that idea he's not the originator of
[1:37:23] it
[1:37:24] he's copying
[1:37:27] god notice let me read it again as still
[1:37:29] God manifests himself on the last days
[1:37:32] the son of man revealing himself in his
[1:37:36] church the human flesh making himself
[1:37:39] known you get it see God down here at
[1:37:41] his church making his word the word
[1:37:43] again the son of man being revealed in
[1:37:46] the last days isn't this in the UN of
[1:37:48] God but remember the same life that was
[1:37:51] in the stalk as in the grain it's just
[1:37:54] maturing right back he revealed himself
[1:37:57] what the son of man the grain that went
[1:38:02] into the
[1:38:03] ground and his ministry
[1:38:07] comes from them
[1:38:11] reformations every man of God is a
[1:38:17] participant of the
[1:38:19] ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:38:22] himself not ever preacher now every man
[1:38:26] of God you see those who make fun and
[1:38:30] life and ridicu as a lot of the message
[1:38:33] so-called believers
[1:38:35] do they are not making fun of the
[1:38:38] ministry of Daryl Ward or David Siler or
[1:38:41] Tim pu or Donnie Reagan or you know some
[1:38:44] of these brothers here at our church
[1:38:46] they're actually
[1:38:48] ridiculing the continuing Ministry of
[1:38:52] the Lord Jesus
[1:38:54] himself remember Paul gave us the
[1:38:57] scripture there in Ephesians and he said
[1:38:59] he led captivity captive and gave gifts
[1:39:04] unto men now Paul is taking this
[1:39:07] from Paul was a Roman citizen and he saw
[1:39:10] no doubt many of these parades and it
[1:39:13] would be when one of these great
[1:39:16] generals would go in and take a country
[1:39:18] or take a city that they would capture
[1:39:22] the leaders the families and the Nobles
[1:39:25] the nobility of that Kingdom and they
[1:39:28] would parade them through the streets of
[1:39:32] Rome and this General would get in his
[1:39:36] Chariot and they would put the mayor or
[1:39:39] the governor if it was a king they would
[1:39:41] either put them beside him in the
[1:39:44] Chariot or they would put him behind in
[1:39:48] Chains and then here's the Roman
[1:39:51] citizens and I stood in that
[1:39:53] that that way that they brought a
[1:39:56] Carolina several years ago when we made
[1:39:57] our first trip to Israel Rome and Egypt
[1:40:01] and they would come through this aan way
[1:40:04] and there would be thousands times
[1:40:06] thousands of people aligned as they
[1:40:09] would come true and the Roman general
[1:40:12] would have chests chests of gold and
[1:40:16] silver and momentos of his image and he
[1:40:20] would reach down when he would get into
[1:40:22] strong of the people and as he's going
[1:40:25] through it pull out a handful of coins
[1:40:28] and throw it to the people he would
[1:40:31] reach down and get another so here is
[1:40:35] the Conqueror and the Conqueror is
[1:40:38] giving gifts unto the people that are
[1:40:42] there Paul captures this and he say the
[1:40:44] mighty conquer conquer death hell on the
[1:40:47] grave and he led captivity captive into
[1:40:51] down paradise and he gave gift unto men
[1:40:54] so the Lord Jesus reaches down in his
[1:40:57] chest of divinity and what did he do he
[1:41:00] started throwing
[1:41:03] gifts
[1:41:04] Apostles prophets evangelists pastors
[1:41:09] teachers so you see every man of God
[1:41:13] with a gift from God is a gift to the
[1:41:16] people in the dispensation that he lives
[1:41:20] for their benefit for their correction
[1:41:22] for their leaders
[1:41:24] ship so that God can bring them back to
[1:41:28] where they come from so the when the
[1:41:31] these people they did not fight they was
[1:41:34] not on on the front with cica they was
[1:41:36] not on the front with Pompei they was
[1:41:39] not on the front and risk their own
[1:41:41] lives they were making bread and you
[1:41:43] know fixing their children's breakfast
[1:41:45] and doing this and that but whenever
[1:41:47] this great gentle had come through and
[1:41:49] there might be a little woman there and
[1:41:51] she's just standing there and she just
[1:41:53] simply reaches up her hand and catches
[1:41:55] that coin as it comes into her hand she
[1:41:59] was a recipient of the Conqueror himself
[1:42:03] so every church that has gifts cuz it's
[1:42:06] not just one gift every church that has
[1:42:09] a pastor has evangelist or teachers and
[1:42:11] missionaries you understand what
[1:42:13] happened to you the Lord Jesus you were
[1:42:15] just standing there and the Lord Jesus
[1:42:17] passed by your way and through a gift of
[1:42:20] a pastor and a gift of a teacher and a
[1:42:23] gift of a missionary and You by the
[1:42:25] grace of God just reached up and said
[1:42:27] praise the Lord that's mine thank you
[1:42:30] Lord Jesus why you never earned it you
[1:42:32] never deserved it you never fought for
[1:42:35] it your general fought for it amen now
[1:42:39] if he gave us this gift do you think we
[1:42:41] need
[1:42:42] him now watch again as he goes on to say
[1:42:46] his ministry comes from them
[1:42:49] reformations back to the original word
[1:42:52] again his
[1:42:54] Ministry listen carefully friends don't
[1:42:56] miss this his ministry comes from them
[1:43:01] reformations back to the original word
[1:43:04] again the word comes to a prophet he
[1:43:06] promised it in Malachi 4 to restore the
[1:43:09] faith of the people back to the original
[1:43:13] grain what one in the
[1:43:15] ground is
[1:43:17] here the same what went in the ground is
[1:43:22] here
[1:43:25] the
[1:43:25] same the grain has come up through here
[1:43:29] it comes
[1:43:31] up as Son of
[1:43:35] God so what happened on the day of
[1:43:38] Pentecost not the son of
[1:43:41] man the Son of God what is God God is a
[1:43:46] spirit so the spirit gave birth to a son
[1:43:50] which could be
[1:43:51] divided the holy Holy
[1:43:54] Ghost praise the Lord praise the aren't
[1:43:57] you grateful for the Holy Ghost today
[1:43:59] what is that Son of
[1:44:01] God so you receive your
[1:44:05] portion of the spirit of God in
[1:44:08] you and yet Paul received it Peter Luke
[1:44:14] John well wonder why they wasn't going
[1:44:16] in a rure wasn't time yet so it's not
[1:44:20] just time alone there's an an anointing
[1:44:24] a release of something from the presence
[1:44:27] of
[1:44:28] God now watch he says oh my it come up
[1:44:33] as Son of God now it reveals itself here
[1:44:37] as son of man then it reveals itself as
[1:44:40] son of David on the throne see them
[1:44:42] three sons just exactly oh my like the
[1:44:46] original countdown we've come into a
[1:44:49] spiritual
[1:44:51] age of Astron or
[1:44:53] not see going above now listen I love
[1:44:58] the way compounds this together makes it
[1:45:00] so simple it's the same Spirit only more
[1:45:06] power Same Spirit only more power so
[1:45:12] here in a little bit I'll be done and
[1:45:14] then we'll sing and we've got a baptism
[1:45:16] and then we'll see how the service goes
[1:45:17] and then you all will be dismissed y'all
[1:45:20] will go get in your vehicles and maybe
[1:45:22] you got your place you're going to eat
[1:45:24] for lunch and you're going to go home
[1:45:26] when you look at your gas gauge and you
[1:45:27] look at think wow I'm almost out of gas
[1:45:30] I got to St and get some
[1:45:32] fuel well when you do you pull up to the
[1:45:35] Gas Pump and there's an Amish
[1:45:39] guy now you know he's an omous but the
[1:45:42] way he looks way he's
[1:45:44] dressed now you're on this side of the
[1:45:46] gas pump and you're seeing the most
[1:45:49] strange thing you've ever seen in your
[1:45:51] life because that Amish guy
[1:45:53] on the other side of the gas pump has
[1:45:55] that gas pump stuck in the mouth of his
[1:46:01] horse and that horse is a kicking and a
[1:46:04] stomping and a raring up and a belching
[1:46:07] them gas fumes and I mean it's making
[1:46:09] him sick as a
[1:46:11] horse no pun
[1:46:14] intended and you're standing there
[1:46:16] looking down and you're thinking what in
[1:46:19] the
[1:46:20] world well you see that would be like
[1:46:23] putting automobile
[1:46:26] fuel in a Luther
[1:46:30] buggy
[1:46:32] Oh Glory so what would it be then if we
[1:46:38] would pull up and you're fixing to fly
[1:46:41] wherever and and you you see a NASA
[1:46:45] truck pull
[1:46:46] up and here's your boing 737 800 Max and
[1:46:52] and you're sitting man you're looking
[1:46:54] out the window because you've got the
[1:46:56] notification from Delta that your
[1:46:58] baggage is supposed to oh yeah there it
[1:47:00] is there it is I see it go on oh my so
[1:47:02] glad so glad and you're getting ready oh
[1:47:04] my the tourist is coming soon
[1:47:06] everybody's getting all ready but you
[1:47:07] see this NASA truck which has Rocket
[1:47:11] Fuel and it's coming putting rocket fuel
[1:47:15] in your
[1:47:17] 737800
[1:47:20] max are you going to continue on that
[1:47:24] flight so you must have appropriate fuel
[1:47:29] to match your
[1:47:33] vehicle now you and I both have heard of
[1:47:36] people once they started condensing the
[1:47:38] pumps and they put diesel pumps also
[1:47:42] right by the gas pumps how many people
[1:47:46] don't nobody please raise your hand have
[1:47:48] got that green one so what did they have
[1:47:50] to do they had to start changing the n
[1:47:52] housle size on the pump filler and also
[1:47:57] on your vehicle to hope it discourage
[1:47:59] some so you fill it up with diesel and
[1:48:01] you go out to there or it may run for a
[1:48:03] little bit until that gas gets out of
[1:48:06] your lines and then you have got major
[1:48:10] problems you see this is where we must
[1:48:13] be properly aligned as who we are and
[1:48:17] what our mode of transportation is and
[1:48:21] we've got to have the right f Fu or we
[1:48:24] will not leave the
[1:48:26] Earth so now let's go the other way
[1:48:29] around so what if we go down to NASA
[1:48:32] brother Daryl and sister Ward and sister
[1:48:33] Jessica was down there here just a few
[1:48:35] days ago and sent me a a picture they
[1:48:37] was there as they was launching I
[1:48:39] believe it was a satellite maybe and and
[1:48:41] they was there as that thing went off
[1:48:42] you know that great big rocket and went
[1:48:44] off into the air so what if brother Dar
[1:48:46] on them would have been standing there
[1:48:48] and they would have saw this Amish guy
[1:48:51] and this Amish guy and he's got written
[1:48:53] on the side you know whatever his name
[1:48:55] is and he's got corn and brother Daryl
[1:48:57] and them standing there looking said
[1:48:59] Cheryl you ain't going to believe this
[1:49:01] they're putting corn in that rocket
[1:49:04] they're putting oats they're putting
[1:49:07] sweet horse food well you don't have to
[1:49:10] worry about that rocket crashing because
[1:49:13] it will not get out of off of the
[1:49:15] ground well you see that's a problem
[1:49:18] that I have with us trying to feed the
[1:49:21] bride of Christ Christ
[1:49:25] Pentecostalism I'm not talking about a
[1:49:27] real Pentecostal experience that's not
[1:49:30] the same thing I'm talking about the
[1:49:33] same mixture of Pentecostalism that I
[1:49:37] saw when I was a
[1:49:39] Pentecostal now I can tell you right now
[1:49:42] it never elevated me very high off the
[1:49:45] ground now I did shout I did run and I
[1:49:48] did jump and I walk the backs of the
[1:49:50] pews you know but I I want to go higher
[1:49:53] than the backs of the pews what is that
[1:49:55] 30 some inches maybe I I need to go a
[1:49:57] little bit higher in this age anybody
[1:49:59] with me I need to go more than just my
[1:50:03] emotions been all fired up and you know
[1:50:06] that I believe in Emotion I need
[1:50:09] something that will absolutely
[1:50:12] revolutionize this 68 year old body in a
[1:50:16] moment in a twinkling of an eye and
[1:50:19] Lutheranism will not do it Methodist is
[1:50:23] will not do it Pentecostalism will not
[1:50:25] do it there's only one thing that'll do
[1:50:28] it astronaut
[1:50:30] fuel praise be to God Amen now here
[1:50:36] comes the old Amish guy and what does he
[1:50:39] have one
[1:50:44] horsepower now the old boy don't need 75
[1:50:47] of them going down to there he's not the
[1:50:49] Budweiser deal so he don't need you know
[1:50:51] them Big C D but he's got one little old
[1:50:54] horse that's exactly hooked up to the
[1:50:57] buggy take him and Ma and the 14 young
[1:50:59] ones up to the store to trade their
[1:51:01] goods and come back and smile even there
[1:51:03] oh they hate you people they don't like
[1:51:06] you you're so worldly ungodly I've never
[1:51:08] understood that quite since one of their
[1:51:09] greatest treasures from us English as
[1:51:11] they call us is our money and the love
[1:51:14] of money is the root of all evil so they
[1:51:16] do all their working and sell all their
[1:51:18] goods so they can get rich on of our off
[1:51:20] of our filthy lcer well come on somebody
[1:51:23] I'm glad for electricity it's really hot
[1:51:25] in here this morning it'd be a lot worse
[1:51:26] if we didn't have electricity it'd be a
[1:51:29] lot worse would it I'm grateful for it
[1:51:31] but you realize if you would look and
[1:51:33] see that you'd think that is so absurd I
[1:51:36] don't understand then why people will
[1:51:39] look at it in the message and think it's
[1:51:41] acceptable so we supposedly have an end
[1:51:45] time word and we have an Endtime vehicle
[1:51:49] to be able to transport us into another
[1:51:51] world and yet we're putting oats and rye
[1:51:55] and molasses and throw in a honey bun
[1:51:57] every now and then who knows it might
[1:51:59] even put in a Mater or potato or banana
[1:52:01] and boy we're just making off concoction
[1:52:03] ever was and we're putting that inside
[1:52:05] of our soul thinking somehow that the
[1:52:09] very same thing that just moves their
[1:52:11] wheels I'm sure that old Amish guy those
[1:52:15] menites Hutterites whatever they are
[1:52:17] they're grateful for that horse I'm I'm
[1:52:19] sure they are but can you imagine if you
[1:52:22] are would have hooked up your horse this
[1:52:24] morning to you about as late as some of
[1:52:26] y'all get to church you still wouldn't
[1:52:28] be here by the time I get done y'all be
[1:52:31] showing up whoa Bessie whoa Bessie I'm
[1:52:35] afraid some of our message folks are
[1:52:37] still woing Bessie I'll tell you one
[1:52:40] thing it's time we unhook Bessie and
[1:52:43] hook up to the son of
[1:52:45] man oh I wish somebody would hear me
[1:52:48] this morning it did not Rapture them it
[1:52:51] will not Rapture brother Donnie don't
[1:52:54] you believe in healing I believe in
[1:52:56] healing I believe in miracles I believe
[1:52:59] in Emotion I believe in shouting but I
[1:53:02] believe it must be based upon this
[1:53:04] evening lifetime
[1:53:08] word oh my we've come into a spiritual
[1:53:11] age of astronauts see going above it's
[1:53:15] the same Spirit only more power yes sir
[1:53:21] so if we could take the oats and run it
[1:53:23] through a an
[1:53:25] analysis and we could take the sweet
[1:53:27] molasses and run it through an analysis
[1:53:29] and they'd be able to figure out how
[1:53:31] many BTUs it would release in the body
[1:53:34] of old Bessie and how much it would help
[1:53:37] Bessie to be able to pull that cart
[1:53:39] behind her no doubt it's a real science
[1:53:41] and no doubt thank God for the Lutheran
[1:53:44] thank God for the Weston thank God for
[1:53:46] the Pentecostal but thank God for the
[1:53:49] astronauts you see in our astronaut tube
[1:53:52] I our fuel is so explosive we have signs
[1:53:55] all over our space tube no smoking
[1:53:59] allowed no drinking allow no running
[1:54:02] around allow no adultery come on
[1:54:04] somebody but you see lucer could drink
[1:54:08] and smoke his pipe and not fear the
[1:54:11] danger of blowing up
[1:54:14] that's well
[1:54:16] Glory now y'all just have to blame this
[1:54:19] sermon totally on the Lord cuz this is
[1:54:21] not the way that I planned on going I'm
[1:54:23] just on page four and I brought about 40
[1:54:25] some pages with me this morning so you
[1:54:27] know what y'all are been entertained by
[1:54:29] the great Entertainer himself the Lord
[1:54:30] God Elohim he wanted to bring you and I
[1:54:33] into a place of special Conservancy to
[1:54:36] be able to open up his word to us I hope
[1:54:39] somebody is
[1:54:40] listening it's the same Spirit only more
[1:54:43] power Luther had a portion of the spirit
[1:54:46] of God but he did not have enough power
[1:54:49] to bring him into a stage of
[1:54:51] sanctification now how you saying how in
[1:54:53] the world can a man sit there and drink
[1:54:55] beer how in the world can a man sit
[1:54:57] there and smoke and and a pipe and do
[1:54:59] all that they done and all that sort of
[1:55:01] thing all in the work of the Methodist
[1:55:03] and they'd be able to shout around and
[1:55:05] still make fun of the gifts of the
[1:55:06] Spirit of God it was the same Spirit but
[1:55:09] the power was not released to open more
[1:55:12] of the word so they danced around glory
[1:55:15] to God oh my lucier come out said come
[1:55:17] on Best come on best you went lucer
[1:55:20] glory to God the shall live by faith

[1:55:29] yall Hallelujah glory to God thank you
[1:55:36] Lord and then John Wesley Struck it and
[1:55:39] he said Lord have mercy we got more
[1:55:41] power than what West have what lucier
[1:55:43] had what was it it was the same Spirit
[1:55:46] only the revelation of the word release
[1:55:49] more power
[1:55:52] amen is it any Wonder to you that they
[1:55:55] found atomic energy and Oppenheimer the
[1:55:59] Jew broke into breaking in as well as
[1:56:02] Einstein and some of those others of
[1:56:04] breaking a
[1:56:07] cell what age not Luther's age not
[1:56:10] Wesley's age remember they had
[1:56:11] scientists back then too but in what age

[1:56:19] Hallelujah more power only lifted higher
[1:56:22] can go higher see more believe more
[1:56:29] Glory see more believe more be more like
[1:56:36] Christ see more believe more be more
[1:56:41] God's calling us Word of Life to see
[1:56:44] more to believe more to be
[1:56:49] more oh my nothing automobile nor the
[1:56:54] horse and buggy not even the airplane
[1:56:58] but the astronaut he sweeps on and above
[1:57:03] each one paragraph 60 he's able to
[1:57:06] achieve talking about the Lord Jesus now
[1:57:09] he's able to achieve to himself a bride
[1:57:13] he's going to in the last days be able
[1:57:16] to get a bride with a
[1:57:20] Ministry like a man and wife becomes one
[1:57:25] when Jehovah gets his people like him
[1:57:28] then he lives in his people they are
[1:57:34] one it fulfills the scripture exactly St
[1:57:37] John 1412 he that believeth on me the
[1:57:40] works that I do shall he also do notice
[1:57:43] I want you to think of how that brother
[1:57:44] Bram does not stop with this now at just
[1:57:47] the prophet again in the countdown now
[1:57:50] is the astronaut age and the astronaut
[1:57:52] sees things in either the Horse and
[1:57:54] Rider automobile airplanes again I know
[1:57:56] you just read that I know I'm reading it
[1:57:58] again he goes higher the airplane notice
[1:58:01] the airplane is still down there
[1:58:04] bouncing around on the
[1:58:10] clouds glory to
[1:58:15] God have you noticed how many in the
[1:58:18] last six
[1:58:20] months people people have been injured
[1:58:24] in severe
[1:58:25] turbulence in the
[1:58:28] skies in the last six months people that
[1:58:32] they've had to rush to the
[1:58:34] hospital planes dropping 15 to 20,000 ft
[1:58:41] in a matter of seconds I mean that
[1:58:43] happens if you're in that cabin and
[1:58:45] you're not buckled up guess what happens
[1:58:47] to you that plane drops and you are
[1:58:51] slammed
[1:58:52] against the ceiling or you're slammed
[1:58:55] against the baggage area there where you
[1:58:58] store your
[1:58:59] carry-ons don't you see what is done
[1:59:03] what's going on oh is it a surprise to
[1:59:06] you that years ago when one of our
[1:59:09] shuttles was sent
[1:59:10] up and it got up so high and then there
[1:59:14] all the world saw it as
[1:59:19] it caught on fire
[1:59:23] exploded what did they find out was the
[1:59:28] problem a
[1:59:33] seal a
[1:59:35] Rubber
[1:59:37] seal that allowed the fuel to enter into
[1:59:40] a chamber and mix where the combustion
[1:59:42] was taking place and it should not have
[1:59:45] done but a
[1:59:46] seal did not
[1:59:48] hold how many in our astronaut age have
[1:59:51] we seen seen many Oh Glory to God I got
[1:59:53] the Holy Ghost Oh Glory to God I got the
[1:59:55] token and then as they go through trials
[1:59:57] and they go through tests and they Veer
[1:59:59] off to the right and they Veer off to
[2:00:01] the left what's the problem a seal
[2:00:05] problem they thought they were sealed oh
[2:00:08] chill didn't hear me this
[2:00:10] [Music]
[2:00:14] morning lord
[2:00:16] god notice he says but he goes beyond
[2:00:19] the clouds of creeds and denominations
[2:00:23] and moves on up into the heavens Plum
[2:00:27] away from everything the astronaut age
[2:00:30] we living the astronaut age just asur as
[2:00:33] God has testified by the natural
[2:00:36] happenings so is he testifying that
[2:00:38] we've achieved an astronaut God has
[2:00:42] achieved what he promised to achieve in
[2:00:44] the last days according to
[2:00:47] Malachi
[2:00:49] 4 so in the AST not
[2:00:55] age God had an
[2:00:59] astronaut that put his hands behind his
[2:01:04] head and he started hearing that song
[2:01:07] I'm lome old so
[2:01:09] lonesome said would you like to look
[2:01:11] beyond the curtain of
[2:01:12] time I think it would help me so
[2:01:17] much I'm not talking about a near death
[2:01:20] experience I'm talking about a moving
[2:01:22] from these four dimensions to the
[2:01:25] sixth and when he rises up and he looks
[2:01:28] back and he sees his body he ain't but
[2:01:30] 20 ft from it and this astronaut landed
[2:01:35] in the sixth
[2:01:37] Dimension praise be to
[2:01:42] God it must have been something John
[2:01:44] Glenn you know and these guys that went
[2:01:45] up to the Moon I me what' they find it
[2:01:47] wasn't cheese what' they find oh they
[2:01:50] brought some rocks back to Earth and
[2:01:51] walked around a little
[2:01:53] bit you know the atmosphere on the earth
[2:01:56] it on the moon rather it hardly has any
[2:01:58] atmosphere at all so a footprint that
[2:02:00] man makes on the moon will lay there for
[2:02:05] decades because there's nothing there
[2:02:07] like we have here the winds and all that
[2:02:09] to change it remember that's
[2:02:12] you so men have walked all over you men
[2:02:15] have treated you bad men have done this
[2:02:16] and that and the other and some of you
[2:02:18] are still bearing in your memory in your
[2:02:21] mind in your Spirit the footprints of
[2:02:23] that preacher or the footprints of this
[2:02:26] and that and the other come on cuz you
[2:02:28] are the
[2:02:30] moon and then God let him had that
[2:02:34] visitation but he felt funny
[2:02:37] funny so the astronaut starts feeling
[2:02:40] funny and he said oh no I don't have to
[2:02:43] go back said yeah go back and tell him I
[2:02:46] don't want to go back I don't want to go
[2:02:50] back
[2:02:53] Hallelujah some of our astronauts have
[2:02:55] been caught in the International Space
[2:03:01] Station and they're not going to be able
[2:03:03] to return to Earth for a
[2:03:05] bit because something happened to their
[2:03:10] vehicle so until they get it fixed
[2:03:13] they're not going to be able to come
[2:03:14] back imagine them old boys flying around
[2:03:17] there doing whatever they do you imagine
[2:03:18] them looking down third and say I've got
[2:03:20] a wife down there I got a baby down
[2:03:22] there and what they want to do they want
[2:03:23] to come back but notice this astronaut
[2:03:26] when he went beyond the curtain of time
[2:03:27] he said oh no I don't have to go back to
[2:03:29] it do I have to go
[2:03:31] back
[2:03:35] Hallelujah so God let him climb back on
[2:03:37] that astronaut tube as it were and he
[2:03:45] landed and he got back in his body
[2:03:52] and then he come to the
[2:03:54] Tabernacle and start telling them I will
[2:03:57] never be the same brother
[2:04:01] brandham that I
[2:04:07] was let me
[2:04:10] close God has achieved in this last day
[2:04:14] according to Malachi 4 the only thing he
[2:04:16] has to do is get somebody in his
[2:04:19] hands that can cut loose
[2:04:23] loose from the
[2:04:29] airplanes and the
[2:04:31] Automobiles and what
[2:04:34] more it'll hold us down every
[2:04:41] time not look back to what it was but
[2:04:47] more power to lift him higher
[2:04:52] lift him into the presence of God lift
[2:04:55] him up there where all things are
[2:04:58] possible now we
[2:05:01] see it's
[2:05:05] happening let's stand let me read one
[2:05:07] more stand rest
[2:05:10] yourself question answer
[2:05:13] 64 I am not
[2:05:16] he I am his
[2:05:19] servant the pillar of
[2:05:22] fire is not
[2:05:25] he it's in spirit form
[2:05:29] see which was upon the son of
[2:05:35] man and has come
[2:05:38] now to
[2:05:41] anoint sons of
[2:05:44] men to bring back a Ministry
[2:05:52] just like he said it would be in order
[2:05:54] for the head notice not a
[2:05:59] minister but a
[2:06:05] Ministry I'm the only minister of my
[2:06:09] Ministry brother brandham was the only
[2:06:12] minister of his
[2:06:14] ministry but Jesus has got tens of
[2:06:17] thousands of ministers in his
[2:06:20] ministry he he's the only one that could
[2:06:22] do
[2:06:23] that so it will bring back now here the
[2:06:27] pillar of
[2:06:29] fire you imagine brother random when he
[2:06:31] meets with the preachers there at the
[2:06:32] church in the brandom Tabernacle in 1961
[2:06:34] and he said Brothers you see what I'm
[2:06:36] doing I'm putting you all in this with
[2:06:40] me you all are
[2:06:44] messengers of the same
[2:06:49] message now it's really pitiful
[2:06:52] but hundreds and hundreds of people in
[2:06:54] this message do not
[2:06:57] believe
[2:06:59] that so even when they push play and we
[2:07:03] hear brother brandom say it they don't
[2:07:05] believe you you know why they've got a
[2:07:07] filter put on them so they pull what
[2:07:10] they hear through them tapes on that
[2:07:13] man-made
[2:07:15] filter and then they say of course that
[2:07:17] brother brandham fulfilled all
[2:07:19] fivefold of the ministry the only
[2:07:21] problem is brother Ben didn't say that
[2:07:24] and the Bible didn't say
[2:07:27] it so notice
[2:07:30] this that which was on the son of man
[2:07:33] has come now to anoint sons of men to
[2:07:36] bring back a Ministry just exactly like
[2:07:40] he said it would be in order for the
[2:07:44] head and the rest of the
[2:07:47] body to connect
[2:07:52] I don't blame the devil for fighting the
[2:07:55] god call Ministry in this
[2:07:58] message cause without them there be no
[2:08:02] head
[2:08:04] Body
[2:08:11] Connection praise the Lord
[2:08:15] Jesus I said one more can I have your
[2:08:17] permission to read one more
[2:08:21] what if 1+ 1 plus 1 equals one reckon
[2:08:24] that works for quotes too
[2:08:26] if Jesus cannot
[2:08:29] come until a church a body of
[2:08:33] Believers and the
[2:08:36] ministry will have to be the same as it
[2:08:39] was
[2:08:42] then then that breaks them that them
[2:08:45] without us is not made perfect as Paul
[2:08:47] said in Hebrews
[2:08:49] 11 without us they canot not be
[2:08:51] perfected they
[2:08:54] they must
[2:08:56] have this
[2:08:59] ministry to raise up the
[2:09:02] Lutheran the
[2:09:04] Wesley and all them down through their
[2:09:08] ages don't you understand Paul needed
[2:09:12] brother brenham's
[2:09:14] message Luther needed this message
[2:09:18] Luther needed it he never even knew what
[2:09:20] it was but he needed you knew is missing
[2:09:22] something Wesley needs this message
[2:09:25] Pentecostals needs this
[2:09:28] message to bring them out from among the
[2:09:35] dead praise be to
[2:09:39] God they must have this ministry to
[2:09:42] raise up the Luther the Wesley and all
[2:09:45] them down Through the Ages when that
[2:09:47] come and that part of of where the
[2:09:49] Eagles gather just as the carcass the
[2:09:52] Eagles have gathered so it had to be
[2:09:55] that Ministry that
[2:09:58] word so when brother brandom leaves the
[2:10:01] Earth then what what what's God to
[2:10:03] do well of course many of these selfish
[2:10:06] men they say I'm the man I'm the one I'm
[2:10:08] the one I'm going to take his
[2:10:10] place I'm not a Moses but I'm a Joshua
[2:10:13] I'm a
[2:10:15] Caleb you're a liar it's what you
[2:10:19] are cuz God's Prophet said the last
[2:10:22] Latter Day message of the last days was
[2:10:24] the Joshua and the calebs of those who
[2:10:26] stayed with
[2:10:29] him praise the
[2:10:31] Lord so what does God do God himself
[2:10:34] comes down on the earth himself don't
[2:10:37] you understand when people fight this
[2:10:39] message of brother brandham they're not
[2:10:41] fighting William
[2:10:44] brandham it's the ministry of Jesus
[2:10:49] Christ I'll go ahead and quote it for
[2:10:51] you
[2:10:53] reincarnated in his church
[2:10:56] again in the last
[2:11:00] days and may I not limit it just to
[2:11:06] preachers I'll go and quote it for you
[2:11:08] anyway Harvest time you are the
[2:11:10] reflection of the last day the message
[2:11:14] of the
[2:11:16] hour so it's not just
[2:11:19] preachers but the Lord Jesus
[2:11:21] in his
[2:11:23] body what was the book of Acts the Lord
[2:11:26] Jesus in his
[2:11:29] body oh excellent
[2:11:33] Theophilus I supposed it needful to
[2:11:37] write unto thee the formal things of the
[2:11:42] Treatise Luke in the book of
[2:11:46] Acts he wrote to him and mentioned his
[2:11:48] name in Luke then he mentions it again
[2:11:51] of the things when brother BR quotes it
[2:11:53] he says of the things which Jesus
[2:11:57] started and
[2:11:58] continues to
[2:12:02] do you know who it was that healed these
[2:12:04] people that come through the prayer line
[2:12:05] the other night wasn't none of these
[2:12:08] preachers no it was Jesus right you know
[2:12:10] who it was that brought them backsliders
[2:12:12] to the Lord through the prayer line the
[2:12:13] other night it was the Lord Jesus if you
[2:12:16] understand it right every God called
[2:12:18] Pastor that stood up today and preach to
[2:12:19] his church God's prophet said Jesus
[2:12:22] still speaks through his
[2:12:32] pastors but don't let it stop with the
[2:12:34] preachers Let Jesus flow through the
[2:12:37] ministry of
[2:12:40] you how brother Donnie loving forgiving
[2:12:44] praying reaching out of hand doing what
[2:12:47] you can to minister to the body
[2:12:52] praise the Lord let's bow our
[2:12:57] heads oh my Lord
[2:13:01] Jesus what have you done
[2:13:06] today what you have allowed us to
[2:13:09] participate in in this end
[2:13:13] time we are so grateful father that we
[2:13:16] have been made to be
[2:13:19] partakers of this great message in the
[2:13:22] last
[2:13:25] days my
[2:13:27] God that same Pillar of Fire not in its
[2:13:31] prophetic
[2:13:33] form but in the other forms and the
[2:13:35] prophet tells us an invisible
[2:13:37] Union it's the same Jesus in Bride
[2:13:43] form the same Jesus in Bride form they
[2:13:48] didn't see the bride was hid in you when
[2:13:50] you were here
[2:13:52] and they didn't see it was you hid in
[2:13:54] the bride after
[2:13:57] Pentecost so the whole thing has been
[2:14:00] hide and
[2:14:03] seek hide and
[2:14:06] seek you hid from Moses but he said show
[2:14:10] me th
[2:14:12] Glory you hid but he knew this something
[2:14:16] so he started
[2:14:18] seeking your Prophet was told by them
[2:14:20] denomination
[2:14:21] leaders that thing that he had on him
[2:14:23] was an evil
[2:14:25] spirit so he went up there alone to
[2:14:28] pray when he was down on his face he
[2:14:32] heard
[2:14:34] Footprints he opened up his
[2:14:36] eyes and the first thing he saw was bare
[2:14:40] feet of a man which was an
[2:14:45] angel Olive
[2:14:47] complexion hadir down to his shoulders
[2:14:52] with his arms
[2:14:54] crossed I have been sent from the
[2:14:56] presence of God to explain to
[2:15:00] you your peculiar births and
[2:15:05] Ministry but I have been told by my
[2:15:08] brothers this is an evil spirit this is
[2:15:11] why I'm here so what was it hadde and
[2:15:16] seek so he went to seek and you made
[2:15:19] yourself known
[2:15:21] years later when he preaches the trial
[2:15:23] he says to me it was Luke
[2:15:27] 17:30 Revelation 10 Malachi
[2:15:32] 4 it brought a fuel to the
[2:15:36] bride oh
[2:15:40] hallelujah oh I know it's been misquoted
[2:15:43] for
[2:15:44] decades and people are still misquoting
[2:15:48] it and they say Rapture in faith lays on
[2:15:51] the tapes that's not what he even
[2:15:57] said rapturing Faith lays in you and as
[2:16:01] the word is being
[2:16:02] preached it comes through that word your
[2:16:05] Prophet never even made that
[2:16:08] statement but people hang their Destiny
[2:16:12] on such a thing and they think by
[2:16:13] playing brother brandom that they're
[2:16:15] getting more rapturing faith every time
[2:16:18] that they hear it and yet deny things
[2:16:21] that he said about going to church and
[2:16:24] if God's in your heart you can't wait
[2:16:26] till them Church doors are
[2:16:29] open the people in 1964 when they' got
[2:16:33] saved and he said now look he said you
[2:16:35] all find you a church to go to seek out
[2:16:38] some of these pastors because if you
[2:16:40] don't have a church you will die
[2:16:44] spiritually
[2:16:47] amen Lord God we know the sad thing
[2:16:49] about it is some people go to church and
[2:16:52] still die
[2:16:53] spiritually so we don't want to die
[2:16:55] spiritually either way we want to be
[2:16:58] alive Lord amen hallelujah
[2:17:02] hallelujah and we know before them
[2:17:04] things take off they put that fuel in
[2:17:08] just right before they're getting ready
[2:17:09] to leave and we have had a deposit glory
[2:17:12] to God but we know the Dynamics of this
[2:17:15] church will be a refilling of the Holy
[2:17:19] Ghost amen
[2:17:22] Hallelujah right before we're fixing to
[2:17:24] blast off into another
[2:17:27] dimension the power of God will surge
[2:17:30] through US
[2:17:31] Lord and change our bodies thank you
[2:17:34] Lord Oh Lord May there not be a one of
[2:17:37] those that sat here
[2:17:39] today be missing on that day yes Lord
[2:17:42] father we believe it with all of our
[2:17:45] hearts help us Lord oh we don't deny the
[2:17:48] truth of Lucen ISM more than the the
[2:17:51] truths of Wesley or the truths of
[2:17:52] Pentecost we just don't want the Creeds
[2:17:54] that follow
[2:17:56] it we don't want the ism part Lord that
[2:17:59] would pull us away from your word we
[2:18:01] want the power that came with it we want
[2:18:03] the power of justification the power of
[2:18:06] sanctification the power of the
[2:18:07] restoration of gifts mix him with the
[2:18:10] power of Malachi 4 that'll take us off
[2:18:13] of this Earth one day in a
[2:18:16] Rapture oh praise the Lord Jesus we
[2:18:20] Worship You Lord
[2:18:22] God thank you

[2:18:40] old but he told his mom and daddy
[2:18:42] they've been been talking to him for a
[2:18:44] while about being
[2:18:45] baptized but he told his mom and daddy
[2:18:47] whenever Brother David preached that
[2:18:49] service on Sunday that the Lord just
[2:18:52] dealt with him and it's just time for
[2:18:55] him to just make everything right with
[2:18:58] god oh you say brother Donnie it's just
[2:19:00] a child how can they know what to be
[2:19:02] baptized I'd say we would be surprised
[2:19:04] if we knew how young the devil starts
[2:19:06] aiming at our
[2:19:08] children I I I couldn't fear our friends
[2:19:10] before the Lord of a child that keeps
[2:19:13] you know wanting his mom and daddy to
[2:19:14] let it be baptized want to be baptized
[2:19:16] and something happened to that
[2:19:18] child and me not allow that child to be
[2:19:20] be
[2:19:21] baptized but what if they're so young
[2:19:23] and they need to do it over I've
[2:19:25] re-baptized a lot of
[2:19:27] preachers must less Ley oh yeah I
[2:19:30] baptized a bunch of preachers they
[2:19:32] didn't want nobody
[2:19:34] there they just felt they wanted to be
[2:19:36] baptized it ain't no sin to be Reb
[2:19:38] baptized this little guy gets 14 or 15
[2:19:40] I'm good at it I'll baptize him again if
[2:19:43] he wants to do it again I'll do it again
[2:19:45] if he needs to do it again but if the
[2:19:47] spirit of God is dealing with his heart
[2:19:50] who can forbid water that's right who
[2:19:53] can forbid
[2:19:54] water what if what if one of these days
[2:19:59] a five or six year
[2:20:01] old will say
[2:20:03] mama Jesus was dealing with
[2:20:06] me and we baptize him nothing great
