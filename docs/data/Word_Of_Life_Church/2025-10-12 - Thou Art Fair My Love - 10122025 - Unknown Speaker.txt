[Music] Hallelujah. [Music] [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. Feel [Music] [Applause] him in my soul. My God is real. He's real in my soul. My God is real. For he has washed and made me whole. His love for me. Aren't you glad it is? It's like pure gold. My God is real. For I can feel him in my soul. Oh my God is real. He's real in my soul. My God is real for he has washed and made me whole. His love for me. It's like pure gold. My God is real for I can feel him in my soul. There are some things [Music] I may not know and there are some places I I can't go. But I am sure to say it of this one thing. My God is real for I can feel him deep within. Sing it now. [Music] Oh, sing it. Oh, his love for me. It's like pure gold. My God is real or I can't feel him in my soul. I cannot tell just how you failed when Jesus took all your sins away. But since that day, I know this. And since that hour, our God's been real. For I can feel his holy power. Our God is real. Say it. He's real. My God is real. For he has washed and made me whole. His love for me is like pure gold. My God is real for I can feel him in my soul. Hallelujah. Oh, give him a real good hand clap of praise in the house of the Lord. And you know what? Times when we don't feel his presence, his nearness, he's still real. &gt;&gt; He's still on the throne. He's still got everything under his control. Do you believe that this morning? Look at your neighbor and tell them you're glad to see him in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a privilege it is to be in the house of the Lord this morning. So glad to have each and every one of you here. We've got a lot of visitors among us today. And we want to say at this time if you are a visitor, we certainly welcome you to our assembly. Want you to feel at home. You're one of us. We're going to have a good time in the Lord here today. Right. and any of our streamers locally and around the world that's streaming this service today. May God bless those folks as well. We hope they'll enter in with us and we'll just have church all over the world this morning. Right. Give the Lord another good hand clap of praise. Amen. Some folks may doubt and some may scorn. All can desert and leave me alone. But as for me, I'll take God's part. For God is real and I can feel him in my heart. Oh, our God is real. He's real in my soul. My God is real for he has washed and made me whole. His love for me. Yes, it is. It's like pure gold. My God is real. For I can feel him in my soul. Praise the Lord. Amen. I'm going to let you be seated for just a little bit. We got a lot of prayer requests that we want to let you know about this morning. First of all, an an announcement. If you if you have today, you have today and Wednesday to submit personal or business changes to the church directory. Please come to the library and submit those changes if you want to make some of those. uh today and Wednesday will be the last time you'll be able to do that. Well, remember I texted Brother Wes RD the other morning and asked him if they they were coming up to the fall festival and he said they really had planned on and wanted to but Amanda's mother, Sister Naomi Jeff passed away on I believe it was Friday morning about 7:00. So, we certainly want to want to remember those folks in prayer that the Lord would would just be with them during this time. I believe her service uh according to what I understand will be tomorrow. So we will remember uh the Jeffre, Brother Wes and Amanda and the family that the Lord would just be mindful of them. Sister Janet Kennedy says to please remember a coworker and a friend's brother. A car fell on him and he has six broken ribs, small lung collapse and puncture air caught in his chest. So they're asking that we would remember that prayer request this morning. Brother Terry Stockton asking the church to pray for his son-in-law over a legal matter. The Lord knows all about that need. Judith Barry says, "Please pray for my youngest brother who was recently diagnosed with esophagical cancer. I believe my brother will be one of the many who recently have testified of being healed from cancer. Thank you and may God bless." So, we certainly want to pray for that need today as we go on into the service. Uh, please remember brother Howard, sister Collins in prayer. Brother Howard fell off of a ladder and landed on his jeep, hurt his leg and hip. Sister has been under the weather for a few days battling a cough. Your prayers will be greatly appreciated. So, we want to remember them. Brother Randy Scott is thanking you for your prayers. Been in the hospital, had two stances put in. Uh, they did find some blockage. Uh, that's been going on for about four weeks now. and they're just asking that we would continue to remember him in prayer and he thanks the Lord for touching him thus far. Brother Greg Robbins tripped and fell yesterday. His hip has hurt him from the fall. He can barely walk today. He is also asking that we pray for his cousin in Richmond. He had hip surgery and the wound is infected. So we want to remember that. Sister Ruth Louise Jax is asking for prayer for a situation with her daughter. The Lord knows all about that.

Want to remember Ed Jablonsky senior for Parkinson's and prostate problems needing prayer. So let's remember him as we pray. Brother Frank and Sister Jackie Williams are requesting prayer for Dave Wilcox who has cancer of the bladder. Scheduled for surgery on Monday. Also, Brother Frank is scheduled for back surgery on Tuesday morning at 7 a.m. at the VA. Brother Frank says he loves everyone and would appreciate your prayers that surgeries for him and Dave Wilcox will go well and they will have a speedy recovery. So, we want to remember that this morning as we pray. [Music] Here's a testimony. Sister Phoebe turns this in. We want to praise the Lord. My brother had several scans this past Thursday and the doctor told him that there is no sign of cancer. Thank you so much for your prayers. Somebody say praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. Sister Sarah Carol sends us in for her brother Daniel Ser. He will be having a very serious surgery on his back this coming Tuesday, October the 14th. Without the surgery, he will lose his ability to walk. Following the surgery, you will be unable to work for about three months. Her family certainly appreciates all of your prayers. So, let's remember that as we pray. Sister Hope Maddie Maddie is requesting prayer. She's at home not feeling well this morning. So, we want to remember her as we pray that the Lord would be mindful of her. Uh want to welcome Sister Morero this morning to the service. Uh well, we all know who she is, but we're so glad to have her in the service this morning. God bless you. Brother Robert's wife visited from from New York. So, we just want to welcome her and all the other visitors. As I said while ago, may God bless you. Uh this announcement uh if you need fall decorations and you need fodder for your fall decorations, they have plenty that's available. You can pick it up down here around the pavilion. And uh brother Michael wanted you to know that. Now, to all that was involved in the fall festival, took part, participated, came, enjoyed the fellowship, and and worked just like I never seen anybody work any harder than what this group did here. We want to say a great big thank you to all that took part. Could we give those folks a good hand this morning? [Music] Praise the Lord. just really really appreciate all the effort and I I do believe that everybody had a good time. I trust you did. Praise the Lord. Our God is real. We've read a lot of needs. We gave some testimonies through it all. God's got it under his control. We're committed to that, right? Sometimes he'll say no. We want to be just as good with that as if he said yes because he know papa knows best. Right? Could we stand together this morning? You have an unspoken prayer request you'd like for this group to pray about, we'll just commit all these things unto the Lord. Brother John, if you'd come this morning, take us to the Lord in prayer. Where's Brother John Hornyak at? He's here. There he is right there. [Music] We love Brother John, don't we? Amen. Let's sing that little course together one more time. My God is real. I want you to sing it with everything you got this morning. If you believe it, he's worth praising this morning. Right, somebody say, "Praise the Lord." Give him one more good hand clap of praise. My God is real. He's real in my soul. My God is real. For I keep and make me whole. His love for me is like real gold. My God is real. For I can feel him in my soul. Amen. He don't only show us he's real from our heart, but he manifests day after day after day. We can see him in all these requests. So many testimonies, so many needs, but he's real in all this. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the Lord in prayer. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we're so glad, Lord, that you're just so real to us, Lord. You're not just a story. You're not just a a a rumor we've heard, Lord, but we've experienced you, Lord. You are a reality in our lives, Father. Lord, there's no denying anybody, Lord, that's really come in contact with you, Father. They they know that it's it it's so much more than than than actually a lot of the church people feel, Lord, because you've you've come to us and you've spoke to us and we've had that communication, that time with you, Lord. We just want to say thank you, Lord. We love you so much, Lord. We've seen you in our lives, Lord. And Lord, that's other people have seen you in our lives as well, Father. That's why we can bring these requests boldly before your throne, Lord. We know, Lord Jesus, that there's an answer in each and every one of these, Lord. And we pray, Father, that you would just move according to your will, your purpose, Lord. Help us to be willing, Lord Jesus, to to say yes. And help us to be able to accept, Father, what you have for us, Lord Jesus. and not only on in physical things, Lord, or financial things, but also spiritual things, Lord Jesus. We we want to grow in you, Father. We want to be attentive to you, Lord Jesus. We pray that you would just move for us, Lord, in a mighty way, Lord. Oh, Father, you know, Lord Jesus, that sometimes we hear things that we don't want to hear and we, Lord, we our flesh backs away from it, Lord Jesus. But if it's for our best, Lord, we want, Lord Jesus, you to speak to our hearts, Lord. That's why we're here today, Father. We ask that you would just move, Lord. Help us draw closer to you, nearer to you, every every moment of the day. Lord Jesus, we love you. We thank you. Be with us in this service today, Lord. Anoint each and every part. May we just enter into worship and praise with you, Lord, with the sincerity of our heart, Lord. And may we hear from you, Father. Anoint the the ministry, Lord Jesus.

Ushers, if you'll come at this time, receive the morning tithe and offering you give us unto the Lord. Once again, visitors, God bless you. We're so glad to have each and every one of you here. Let's sing an old song this morning. Heaven's Jubilee. We're fixing to have a jubilee that's never been experienced like the one we're getting ready to, right? Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Some glad morning we shall see. Jesus in the air coming after you and me. All the joys to share. What rejoicing there will be when the saints shall rise before that jubilee. Yonder in the sky. Oh, what's singing on that happy morning when we all shall rise. Oh, what glory when we meet our blessed savior in the sky. Seems that now I almost see all the sainted day rising for that jubilee that is just ahead in the twinkling of an eye change with them to be all the living saints to fly to that jubilee. Oh, what singing? Oh, on that happy morning when we all shall rise. Oh, what glory. When we meet our blessed savior in the sky. And with all that heavenly host we begin to sing. Singing in the Holy Ghost. How the heavens will ring. Millions there will join the song. With them we shall be praising Christ through ages long. Heaven jubile. Oh what singing. Oh, on that happy morning when we all shall rise. Oh, what glory. Oh, when we meet our blessed savior in the sky. Yes. Oh, what singing singers if you'll come on on that happy morning when we all shall rise. Oh, what glory when we meet our blessed savior in the sky. When with all that heavenly host we begin to sing. Sing in the Holy Ghost. How the heavens will ring. Millions there will join the song. With him we shall be praising Christ through ages long. Heaven jubile. Oh what singing. Oh on that happy morning when we all shall rise. Oh, what glory when we meet our blessed savior in the sky. Praise the Lord. You can be seated this morning. Give our singers a nice hand as they sing for you today. Sister Burns, if you want to come [Music] [Music] I woke up the other night. I thought I was having a dream. I thought I heard a very loud noise, but dreams are never as they seem. I dreamed the end of time had come. I hoped it wasn't real. I remember thinking what I hadn't done. Then everything got real still. [Music] At the sounding of the trumpet, in the twinkling of an eye, where had I heard these words before? Oh, look at the eastern sky. I never thought you'd come so soon. I never read the signs. I never worried about the end. For I thought I'd have more time. He's coming and I can't stop it. It's not a dream anymore. There goes my father, my mother, my sister, and my brother. [Music] They're all going home. [Music] I went to church on Sunday, read my Bible once a week, and on two occasions every year, I tried to be humble and meek. Are you saying, "Lord, it wasn't enough?" Are you saying it was all in vain? Don't take this time to remind me. I promised you everything. [Music] Well, everyone is gone now. And I'm here all alone. [Music] I thought I was a Christian, but oh Lord, was I wrong for praying a prayer and singing a song and responding to an altar call. Now I know that's not what it takes. I should have made him Lord of all. Oh, he's coming and I can't stop it. It's not a dream anymore. For I see Jesus standing as our father. Not for me. [Music] They close the door. [Music] [Applause] [Music] If you have felt the dark of night, questioning what is out of sight, he is the answer. He is the light. [Music] If you have felt the weight of sin, bound by the shame that hand you in, he'll break the chains. He will forgive. Lift your head. Morning is coming. There's more to the story. Don't forget. In grief and in glory, still great is his faithfulness. [Music] If you felt broken and betrayed, no one to trust alone, afraid, he'll comfort you. He knows your name. [Music] If you've wrestled with the ache of loss and why this has been your road to walk, he bore your pain. He wore your cross. So lift your head. Morning is coming. There's more to the story. Don't forget. In grief and in glory, still great is his faithfulness. Wait on him. Rest in him. Come find your peace again. Trust in him. Hope in him. Great is his faithfulness. Wait on him. Rest in him. Come find your peace again. Trust in him. Hope in him. Great is his faithfulness. Great is thy faithfulness. Great is thy faithfulness. Morning by morning, new mercies I see. Lift your head. Morning is coming. There's more to the story. Don't forget. In grief and in glory, still great is his faithfulness. In grief and in glory, still great is his faithfulness. He's so faithful. In grief and in glory, still great is his faithfulness. [Music] [Applause] You can all help me sing this. Worthy, worthy is the lamb. [Music] Thank you for the cross, Lord. Thank you for the price you paid, bearing all my sin and shame. In love, you came and gave amazing grace. Thank you for this love Lord. Thank you for the nail pierced hands washed me in your cleansing flow. Now all I know your forgiveness and embrace. Worthy is the lamb seated on the throne. crown you now with many crowns. You reign victorious. Oh high and lifted up. Jesus, son of God, the darling of heaven, crucified. Worthy is the lamb. Worthy is the lamb. [Music] Thank you for the cross, Lord. We thank you for the price you paid. Bearing all my sin and shame. In love, you came and gave amazing grace. Thank you for this love, Lord. We thank you for the nail pierced hands washed me in your cleansing flow. How all I know your forgiveness and embrace. Oh, worthy is the lamb seated on the throne. We crown you now with many crowns. You reign victorious. Oh high and lifted up. Jesus, son of God, [Music] the darling of heaven, crucified. Oh, worthy is the lamb. Yes, worthy is the lamb. [Music] Oh, worthy is the lamb. [Music] [Applause] Praise the Lord. So grateful today for his great love and mercy to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where would we be without him? &gt;&gt; Where would we be without his grace? We certainly welcome each of you here today. All the visitors that are in our gates, we appreciate you being here as well. Let's turn to Song of Solomon if you would today. Chapter 4, verse 1. Song of Solomon, chapter 4, verse one. Listen carefully to these four verses here. Song of Solomon was called the Holy of Holies of the Old Testament. The Jews would not even let their children read this book until they become of age because of the seriousness of it of course and the way that they looked at it. So whenever we read it, we want to keep in mind that it is about Solomon and the Schulamite, but it is more than that. It's it's a for a figure of the Lord Jesus and his bride. And if you fit in these verses today, you ought to be the happiest one of them, happiest people in the world. &gt;&gt; If you fit in these verses now, many people think they do, of course, and they don't. Many church members that belong to all kinds of churches and even some message people think that they do. But yet if we do, I love the statement that the prophet makes. Son of God seed produces son of God seed. &gt;&gt; So if you're a son of God, a daughter of God, then out of your life will come forth the original product of God's word. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Sure. You're still a human. You'll have your battles and things like that, but let's read carefully. Behold, thou art fair, my love. Behold, thou art fair. Apparently, she needed to hear it twice cuz she knew herself. Thou hast dove's eyes within thy locks. The hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Mount Gilead. Now, let me just say, you young brothers that have a girlfriend, if I was you, I wouldn't tell her this because she will not appreciate it. If you tell her your hair looks just like goat hair, um you might be eating your meals out of a straw for a few days. But to the women of this era and to the types and the shadows and all the things that's in here, this is a very great compliment because to have black goats, the black hair, it was the the greatest price of the goats. Very very shiny, a real sheen about them. So to her she would have took this as a as a compliment. Thy teeths are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn which came up from the washing whereof everyone bear twins and none is barren among them. Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet. Now watch each one of these little phrases. It has something a meaning. Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet. So out of her mouth, she's speaking of redemption, scarlet, and mercy. And thy speech is comely. Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks. Thy neck is like the tower of David. build it for an armory. Who are we talking about? We're talking about the bride. &gt;&gt; So look at her face. Notice focusing on her face and then coming from her face down to her neck. And then her neck is like a tower. So it's an armory. So in there hangs the weapons of great valiant men that have been identified with her. Thy neck is like the tower of David, builded for an army where on there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men. Let's bow our heads together. How many like to be remembered today as we pray? Heavenly Father, as we've assembled here today and we want you to know that we're so grateful, Father, for the opportunity that we can be together, we thank you for our time that we could have together here at the Fall Fest. And um our friends that have come to be with us, brothers and sisters from different places, and we are honored that they would come and spend a few days with us. And it reminds us that one day, Lord, when we will stack our arms for the last time and we go home and all of the soldiers of God are able to gather together. No more fighting, no more war, no more difficulties. Lord Jesus, each of us come here today to church. We have needs in our lives. We have desires. We have areas that we need help, Father. and we're not ashamed to bring those needs to you. Help us, I pray. Minister to every heart. Help me to get out of the way. Father, speak to us the words of life. In the name of the Lord Jesus, we ask it. And the saint said, &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated. I want to speak to you from verse seven. And I want you to notice that the seventh verse is where he talks about her and she's reached a spot in his eyes which only he would be able to achieve. Thou art fair. My love, my love, there is no spot in thee. Now all fair is a state of perfection and beauty, perfect comeliness, and it's not her own. It's not that she has finally been able to meet all these standards, the dos and the don'ts, and thou shalts, and thou shalt not. and she's been able to do that and she's actually arrived and she's living a faultless human life. There is no such a thing. The mystery is not that God will wait for his bride, his people to get to a spot to where that every one of them who go in the rapture will finally reach a place where they'll never make another mistake. Even Walt Disney couldn't make something that far out. &gt;&gt; You're always going to be a human being until you're changed. &gt;&gt; And you're going to need the mercy of the Lord Jesus. I don't care how long you've been saved, how long you've been around the message. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But yet, whenever you look at it in the right way, and I know that there's always been people that have taken this part of God and his nature and his character, and they go to either one side or the other, either the legalistic side or the grace side so much that you can do pretty much whatever you want to do, live any life that you want to live, and God accepts you, you'll go to hell doing that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God requires a holy, godly life. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But now it shows her completeness is not in herself. It's him saying this about her. It's not her saying it about herself. It's not even her family members or her pastor or her friends or neighbors that are saying this about her. It's him. And he's the only one that could say it. Read with me in Colossians 1 22. in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight. &gt;&gt; Not in your own. &gt;&gt; Not in the sight of others, &gt;&gt; but in his sight. Unblamable means without blemish. The word was applied to the temple sacrifices which had to be offered without blemish. Unreprovable means free from accusation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Once we have been reconciled to God, no charges can be brought against us if we're in Christ Jesus. Now, there's the catchy part. There are many who think they're in Christ when in reality, they're on their way, but they've not yet arrived. &gt;&gt; If you don't have the Holy Ghost today in your soul, you're not here. &gt;&gt; You can believe the gospel. You can be saved, sanctified, lay aside this habit, that habit, you even accept the message of the hour. And God sent a prophet, and all that's well and good. Brother Brandham told me, she said, "Well, Brother Brandham, I believe every word you said." He said, "That's just being able to read." &gt;&gt; And that's what the sad thing about it is, friends, I'm afraid around the world, that's where a lot of our message people are. They're just able to read. God sent a prophet. Praise the Lord. and we believe this and we believe that. But if what we believe don't make us like Christ, something's wrong with our belief. &gt;&gt; Now, whenever it comes to that spot, you realize that no charges can be uh accepted against us. They can be brought because Satan, the accuser, will constantly go before the throne of God and to accuse us. And many times he accuses us with truths of our failures and our shortcomings. How many still has them? &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. We're glad to have the rest of you angels that are here today. God bless you. But the thing of it is, God will not accept the accusation against a son or daughter of God that is truly in Christ Jesus. Notice in Romans 4:7, saying, "Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. Now, is that every Christian? No, it's not. Is that every person who says they love the Lord and they go to church? It is not. Because if it is, they all go in the rapture together. So, there's no need for us to live a sanctified life, a separate life. Everybody's going to heaven anyway. So, you can drink and do whatever you want to do and dope and get high, go to church and scream and holler, "Amen." and the rest of us have to live a godly life. No, there ain't none of that trash going to heaven. &gt;&gt; There ain't going to be no dope addicts in heaven. Ain't going to be no drunks in heaven. Ain't going to be no adulterers, no fornicators, no liars. Come on, y'all want to have church today. If we go to heaven, we're going to live a life that is worthy of the gospel of Jesus Christ. I love the way the prophet in the first seal, he says, "If the church has been judged and they have judged themselves and have accepted the blood, how can God judge a man that's perfectly totally sinless?" &gt;&gt; I wonder out of all these hundreds of people that are here today, how many are this? Of all the thousands times tens of thousands that follow this message, yes, &gt;&gt; how many of them are this one quote? &gt;&gt; That's his beloved. &gt;&gt; That's his beloved. Now watch. How can God judge a man that's perfectly totally sinless? You say there's no such person. And he said, "Every bornagain believer, true believer, is perfectly absolutely sinless before God. &gt;&gt; He's not trusting in his works and the blood of Jesus. That's where his confession is dropped into." And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Well, you say, "I'm not there, brother Donnie." Well, keep on working until you get there. Let God do the work of justification, sanctification until he fills you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Then one day you can be able to stand up and say, "I have finally arrived to that quote right there." Some of us want to fulfill quotes of casting out devils and healing the sick, raising the dead, cleansing the lepers. All that's well and good. I want to fulfill them, too. But what good does them do if I can't fulfill this one right here? Actually, casting out devils ain't going to put us in the rapture. But this one here says, "Your destiny is secure." &gt;&gt; Watch this in 1 Thessalonians 3:13. To the end that he may establish your hearts, unblameable in holiness before God, even our father, at the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints. Also 1 Thessalonians 5:23, "And the very God of peace sanctify you, holy, I pray God, your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ." Second Peter 3:14, "Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless." &gt;&gt; How many believes there's a people like that? &gt;&gt; Now, the next question is, is it you? It's good to believe there's a people that like that, &gt;&gt; but it's even better to know when you have so entered into Christ Jesus that that's you. So, it's like the little boy looking in the mirror that had never seen himself and he waves and the little boy the mirror waves back and he steps. You've heard the prophet tell the story and he goes back and forth and finally he turns around to his mother and he says, "Why mama? That's me. That's me. You see, it will be finally God climaxing the revelation of the bride seeing who she is is what's going to bring the rapture. It's not just us recognize who your mama, your daddy, your favorite preacher is. Listen to me. It's not even just you being able to recognize Brother Brandon was a fulfillment of Malachi 4. But the prophet said, "When the bride sees who she is, then the rapture will go, &gt;&gt; not come, &gt;&gt; go." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Can anybody say it with me? Help me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now watch again in Jude verse 24. Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy. Now what I've read to you just so far in this part of the sermon is an absolute masterpiece of almighty God. A work that I have read to you about just in these few a few short verses and a few moments that I've been up here is a masterpiece that only God himself could ever make. None of us on our own can ever make these verses happen in our life. Even the angels of God with their great power would never be able to coax us in to this position. There's only one way we can get there and that is first of all we are invited. The Lord God invites us himself into the inter sanctum of his presence and we are invited into that shikina glory of God to be partakers of his divine nature. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are changed. Now, let me let me remind you of of an Old Testament character that many of you Bible readers are familiar with, and his name was Mphibichef. Mphibichef was uh the son of Jonathan. And Jonathan was David's best friend. And they were just buddies. I mean, they were just like that. They loved one another so much. And they were so close. And we remember that what happened to Mphibicheth was that the armies had come in and his nurse grabbed him and he's a child and his nurse grabs him and she's going to run away with him and try to protect him. Now what happens is that while she is running with this child in her arms, she falls. In her fall, she dropped this child Mphibicheth. And then it caused him to be lame for the rest of his life. Now, how was he made lame? Because a woman fell and whenever she fell, he fell with her. &gt;&gt; Come on, Mphibicheth. &gt;&gt; Some of you Mphibicheths, you ought to see yourself right there. Amen. &gt;&gt; But David, he so loved Jonathan. You remember the story of course that Saul and Jonathan both their lives taken on Mount Gabo. And David moves into his kingdom. And he began to think about, you know, Jonathan and what great friends that they were. And he wanted to see if there was any of Jonathan's seed that was still alive. And he found out about this young man. And so he he sends a message and messengers that they would be able to go get him and invite him. Now remember, it was the common custom among kings of that day if there was any seed left of anybody that might potentially try to take their throne to kill them. &gt;&gt; So Mphibicheth really would have had a death penalty on him because he was a grandson of Saul. Well, I had a death penalty on me because I was a son of a fallen Adam. You had a death penalty on you because you was the son or a daughter of fallen man. Is that right? But you know what David done? He looked and he called it. I can imagine as Mphibicheth was called into this court that he wondered. He must have been nervous and anxious and thinking, "Oh my goodness, he's going to take my life." It was a common practice. He's going to take my life. He's afraid that I I will threaten his kingdom. I would never do that. My daddy loved him. So he didn't know. He did not know. But when he comes in and I just imagine myself, David being a man of great such per personification. David knew anger. He knew anxiety. He knew all kinds of emotions. You imagine when he saw Mphibicheth and the emotional tie in his heart to Jonathan so expressed itself on his face that Mphibicheth knew he had found favor in David's sight. Listen now in his sight. So the way that it was reflected off of his face. Now remember this is one of the scriptures in the book of Deuteronomy that Moses called the ministers to put on the children of Israel. And he told him to say this and put the name of the Lord on the children of Israel. May the Lord bless thee and keep thee. May the Lord cause his face and his countenance to shine upon thee. One of my favorite scriptures in all the Bible. For I figure if God can do that, everything else I have need of will be included in that one package. So David was able to reflect that and Mphibicheth looking on him and seeing in his eyes. Now keep this. There's something about eyes. Something about eyes. The first time eyes is mentioned in the Bible of course was in the in the book of Genesis and the Garden of Eden. Eyes. Eyes are such a powerful thing. And it's no wonder then that the Lord Jesus whenever he writes about his bride through the through the person of Solomon and the Song of Solomon that her eyes are mentioned over and over again. Now s the eyes are the inlet to the soul. So if your eye is single then it can tie into the purification of your heart, your spirit, your flesh, your soul before God. Those whose eyes are not single, by that I mean they're looking at one main goal in life. They have other things in life that they want, other things in life that they're going to do. But their main goal, remember the scripture uses this term, if your eye be single. So that is your main goal in life is to be what God ordains you to be then in your eyes, you project that image. And the Lord Jesus looks into your eyes. So when he looks into our eyes, what does he see? Does he see many different goals, many different desires, many different achievements, or does he see one main thing and then all the rest of them are prioritized according to the value of God's predestinated will? Was somebody going to say amen with me this morning? Now, to me, that's what the real believer should be. You agree with that? So, how that the Lord can be able to look at us and say that thou art fair, my love. Now notice she has moved into a special status with him that no one else ever had. And yet he knows along the journey that she will have slack times in her life. Maybe some of you sitting here today and you're finding yourself in kind of a a cold kind of place with the Lord. Maybe a place where you're not reading your Bible. you're not praying like you should and you found little things creeping back into your life that you got rid of years and years ago. And look, you know, if you find yourself there, it doesn't mean that the Lord Jesus is going to trash you. It doesn't mean that he's going to throw you on that trash heap of humanity and there's no mercy for you. He knew that we would be as human beings that we would go through ups and downs and ins and outs of life. But aren't you glad his love for us never changes? &gt;&gt; Now, I don't mind telling you as human beings, we love one another more at times than we do at other times. Whenever we're kind of getting on one another's nerves or we mess up and and we look at one another and we sometimes don't have near as much grace for one another. And the church said, "But I'm so glad that the Lord can look farther than what I look and look farther than what you look and to be able to see when people are messing up big time." I dare say if you've been saved very long today, whether you're this is your home church or you're a visitor, I imagine most of us have messed up pretty bad at times in our lives, haven't we? It's what I figured. Yeah. But you see, he knew that she would do that and he knew that she would have this in her because she has split. She has a nature in her that is is divine. I love the way the prophet describes it in thirst in 1965 and he says that people of the day where they are they find themselves living between two desires. So he describes it like a control tower and he said the things of the world will run in from the outside into the control tower and it will tell you you want this, you need that. There's a natural control tower and a spiritual one. For those that are truly born again, then they have a new captain in the control tower, which is the Holy Ghost. Now, the one in the body, it's still there. But the one in the soul is commanderin-chief, and he takes authority over the other one. Now, can you imagine? You're flying in and out of Atlanta, the world's most busiest airport. I've been in many of the major airports of the world, and you see them them guys up there and saying, "Wow, what a what a responsibility. They have this flight coming in, this one leaving, this one doing this, this one do that." Well, if you can imagine it, that's your soul. &gt;&gt; That's your humanity. So here's the control tower setting right out and they're not way back over three miles away. They're right there in the middle of all the action. So they're looking at radar. They're looking through the windows. They're seeing all these things that are going on. That's the way you live your human life every day. So in the control tower of your humanity is thirst and desires. you know, something that runs in on your body whenever you're hungry, whenever you're thirsty, when you need fellowship, when you need friendship. And there's things then that Satan will try to tap into that control tower that will get you to sin. And remember, whenever that happens, it's demons that have access the natural thirst inside of you as a human being. &gt;&gt; And Satan will then try to pull you over under demonic influence. Somebody said, "Amen." What was it that talked Eve to sinning in the very beginning? What was it? A fallen angel. &gt;&gt; A fallen angel talked her into sinning. What is it that talks you and I into falling short of the glory of God? &gt;&gt; Fallen angels again. And then they run in on what? Something weird and strange? Something outside of you? No, it's something that they use that's in you, which is your own thirst. And if the Holy Ghost is not in your soul, and the majority of humanity, it's not. Then they do whatever that thing wants. If they want to get drunk, they get drunk. If it says do whatever, that's exactly what they do. And the sad part about it is most of them do not have the power to be able to say no. Their conscience will hold them for so long. Message teaching will hold them for so long. But even the teaching of the message will not keep the power of sin out of your soul. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. That's exactly right. If that tpost is not down inside of your soul, you can know the Bible frontwards and backwards. You can quote so many quotes. It would be remarkable to hear them. But if you ain't got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you're not sealed by the power of God, you'll never make the grade in this end time. Demon powers are streaming in every direction. As a matter of fact, the prophet tells us in 1961 that the lid has been took off of the cattle and demon powers are streaming in every direction. But I want to let the devil know this morning, not only are demon powers streaming in every direction, but the Holy Ghost is streaming in every direction. And the angels of God are also in every direction. As a matter of fact, they're right here in this building this morning. The angels of God are right here to minister to you, to nudge you, to encourage your faith, to help you come to your position. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh my. uh in in spite of her faults, in spite of her failures, he uses this term of the deepest endearment of how he feels about her in that he calls her my love. &gt;&gt; My love now my love what? So is she the only love that he has? No. God so loved the world cosmos that he gave his only begotten son. So God loves other than his bride, but she's the only one that he loves to this degree. He does not call the foolish virgin his love. He does not call the 144,000 his love. He calls the bride his love. My love. My love. So she actually becomes a personification of what he projected to her from his own heart before the foundation of the world. So what has she become? His love. My love. My love. There is no remembrance now of her follyies. There is no remembrance of her shortcomings. Only God can do this. &gt;&gt; He does not cherish. Think of it. He does not cherish the thought of our failures. As a matter of fact, he wants to put it as far from him as he can. And he knew that we would need this. And this is why John said, "Little children, I write unto you that you sin not. But if any man sin, we have an advocate with the father, which is Jesus Christ the righteous, who is a perpetuation of our sins, and not ours only, but the sins of the whole world." Now you imagine John is not writing to the to the dead church people. He's not writing to people that's not even saved. He's writing to children of God. Why? Because you have been changed from a cocker and you've got a wheat heart inside your soul, but your outside is still cocker. And don't you never trust it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The day you start trusting your flesh, you're defeated. &gt;&gt; Amen. It'll lie to you. &gt;&gt; It'll talk you into things. &gt;&gt; Yes, it will. It'll call you call It'll absolutely cause you to do terrible things. It will absolutely do it. It's just, you know, it's just the way the flesh is. It's unregenerate. It don't like God. &gt;&gt; The flesh don't like hard preaching. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; The flesh don't like laying aside this and that and the other. The flesh wants to be pampered and babyed. The flesh loves entertainment. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Preached by the Donnie. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Notice this. In the Ephesians church age, the true church of Jesus Christ, the bride, is likened to pure gold. Her righteousness is his righteousness. Her attributes are his own glorious attributes. Her identity is found in him. Friends, if we're not found in him today, we are no better than any other denomination. &gt;&gt; If we are not in Christ Jesus, oh, brother Donnie, how can I know that I'm there? For by one spirit, we are all baptized into that one body. And if you're baptized into that body, you cannot have the Holy Ghost and deny one of God's words. &gt;&gt; That Holy Ghost in you will say amen to the word. Even though your flesh may say, "Oo, that hurt. Oh, that hurt. Oh, that hurt." But your soul will say, "Amen, Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Notice her identity is found in him. What he is, she is to reflect. Glory. Oh my. She is to what he has, she is to manifest. There is no fault in her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's people sitting in this building today who match this. They are thoughtless. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; But they're the biggest messer uppers you ever seen in your life. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And they still fight temper and they still fight this and that and the other. &gt;&gt; Well, you say you're confusing me. Well, good. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Hope confusion then help you get straight out. &gt;&gt; Come on. When are we ever going to come to a spot and realize it is not us that can produce his friends. If we don't get to the Lord Jesus and get this, we are not going in a rapture. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You can come to this church. You can go wherever you go to church and be as faithful as you can be. If you don't get this, you miss it. &gt;&gt; Don't you understand? You miss it? Oh, I wish I could get it to the to the people in an urgency of the hour and realize this is bride material we're talking about. Not just coming to church, not just listening to tapes, all that's good. But if you don't cross that line to where you become this, you are not going in the rapture. You understand where you're headed? Straight for the tribulation period. I mean, the bride is gone. All hell is going to break loose on this earth like it has never been before. Please children, stop playing church. &gt;&gt; Please stop sitting around and while I do this and I do that. When are we going to come to a spot till we realize this is a matter of life and death? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She is all glorious within and without from beginning to ending. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She is the work of her Lord and all his works are perfect. In fact, in her is summed up and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of God. Not in angels, not in cherubams, not in saraphims and zoons and all the the stars and the moon and the sun. In the bride, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; is summed up and manifested the entire purpose of God. &gt;&gt; How can one fathom it? How can one understand it? Though we cannot do that, we can accept it by faith. &gt;&gt; I accept it this morning. &gt;&gt; For God hath spoken it. Now watch in in this verse number eight. Come with me from Lebanon. Now this is the same Lebanon actually that Israel is fighting on their northern border where they've just been fighting for the last two years on a radical group called Hezbollah. It's the same Lebanon and their enemies are still there. As a matter of fact, according to some of the intelligence that they're getting, they're figuring that once they get their hostages back and all the wars resolved in Gaza that Hezbollah is going to attack again. Well, when I look at that, I realize that that Lebanon is sort of like us. Now remember from where the Shulamite lived from the place of Shunam and many of you Bible readers probably already know that the word Shulamite is the feminist form of Solomon. Feminist form of Solomon. So Solomon Caesar is in the north country. So you go into Galilee up where the Lake Guinness or Lake Galilee is. And then you keep going north and you got the Golan Heights. We stood there a few years ago right up on the Golan. And you look down over the brim of the Golan Heights and there's the Sea of Galilee. And the Syrians a few years ago was up on the Golan and they were shooting rockets and missiles and all kinds of things down on the saints of God in their promised land in the land of Galilee because they held the high ground. And this is why Israel said, "We need the Golan. We need some of you need the Golan of your life today." Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to notice these terms of what Solomon said. Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse. Now, she enters in to a new relationship that he had not used before. And it was, my love was wonderful, but now he calls her something different. She is now not just an engaged bride, betrod, but she is now his wife. &gt;&gt; Now, think of it. Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse. Come with me from Lebanon. Notice how many times he's repeating these things. Look from the top of Aana. Top of Aana. From the top of Shener and Hermon. Now, for those of you that know the topography of Israel, you know that this is the upper elevations of the entirety of the nation of Israel. Mount Hermon can have snow up on it. It does every year. They have ski resorts up on Mount Hermon. Remember David talking about snow. And yet down in the lower part of it, of course, it's desert. But some of these are mountains and they're they're craggy. And there they have wild beast. They have leopards. They have lions. They have all kinds of things. And this is near the homeland of where the Shunomite was born and raised. So this is the country where she comes from. And notice the bridegroom is he is calling her away from her homeland into another home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, and with me from Lebanon. Look from the top of Aa and from the top of Shener and Hermon from the lion's Oh my goodness. from the lion's dens and from the mountains of the leopards. Now, this is where she's from. This is the place she had her nativity at. But he's calling her now. She's entered in to the spouse state. She is his love. She is his spouse. She has now been received in the marriage covenant. And now he's giving her, hallelujah, the marriage call. Come with me, my spouse. But notice, I want you to go up now, bride, and I want you to look from Shener, from her ama, and from Hermon, from the lion's dens. You mean every bride member is going to have lion's dens in their lives? How many has them in your life? Some of y'all probably so much. That's your living room, ain't it? Your living room, your kitchen, your bathroom, your closet. It seem like you live in the lion's den. Well, maybe it's time for you to come out of there today. Now, I want you to notice what he said from the lion's dens. So, you see the whole idea is the Shulamite, which was a virgin girl. And whenever Solomon, we're taught by history that he was in the northern part of his kingdom and whenever he came through that he saw her and he was overwhelmed by her. Absolutely overwhelmed. Now, remember, he can marry any woman that wasn't married in his kingdom. He can marry king's daughters. He can marry princesses. He can marry all kinds of people. But whenever he saw this Shulamite, she so smit his heart. I mean, she smoteed him so much. She took his breath. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't you understand? You took his breath. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; On Mount Calvary. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You took his breath. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. He was so smitten by you. &gt;&gt; He could not leave you where you were &gt;&gt; in the lion's dens. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And in the leopard's caves. Oh my. So this is where she's from. In these crazy outcrops of this mountainous type of area. Those of you that have never been there, it's quite a place to see it. Very inhospitable scenes. And this is where she comes from. But he's calling her to where? Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now remember the city of the king, King Solomon was Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he is calling her from Hermon, from Amana, calling her from Shener and from these other places of the Golan to where there's lion's dens and leopards and all this sort of thing. He's saying, "Come away, my love." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come away with me my love. You imagine her thinking this poor country girl and then she said about herself I am black but clumbling. Now to them at that time a fair skinned woman was the most beautiful women. And those women which were whitish type skin it was a sign that they didn't get out and work in the sun. So they were rich ladies of course. So they stayed in the house. But this woman she had the look about her that she'd been in the presence of the sun. I hope we have the look about us that we've been in the presence of the son of man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. The world may laugh at us and make fun. Well, let them do whatever they want to do. I really don't care. As long as I hear this call right here, let them call me what they will. But one of these days when you come looking for me, don't come looking very far because call me, I won't be here. I'll be gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, notice now the chener, the Hermmon, the ama. A region of rocks and mountains and steep crevices. Very dangerous place to live. Sounds like my everyday walk with God. &gt;&gt; Sounds like your everyday walk with God. You got craggy spots and steep places and lion's dens as in plural. So, we're not talking about a little house cat about that big meow meow. If that's all your battles are, you need to join a real army. But the real bride of Christ, we don't have little house cats and and the little cushions over here somewhere. I'm talking about we face real lions in the battle we're in. We face real leopards. And remember, the leopard in the Bible is a power. Remember the vision that Daniel saw about a leopard. Of course, it represented an Old Testament uh kingdom that was coming up. Leopards, lions, those things are powers. And this shows what we are against today in this building. A great warfare is going on. The angels of God are here. But guess what? There's also another side. Demons are all in this place this morning. They're trying to anoint your sinking. They're trying to keep you away from the promise of God. If you're sick, they want to block you off from your healing. If you're bound with besetting sins in your life, they want to block you all from your deliverance. But the angels of God are standing by your pews and they're trying to anoint your faith. And the prophet says at one time in a discernment, he said, "Them demons are calling to one another and they're saying, can't you hear it?" He said, "Keep them from believing. Keep them from believing." He said, "But faith is accumulating." And he said, "The battle is going to go and it will be determined by the way you look at it." So, how you going to look at this service today? Are you going to look at it? Well, I like lion's dens and I like leopard caves and I like living a dangerous type of life. My Lord Jesus is here calling for a bride to get her ready to say, "Come away, my love. Come out of this earth." Don't you understand, friend? Every day we live here in this earth, it's becoming more unfit for the bride to live in. Men don't know if they're men. Women don't know if they're women. And oh my, the world is creeping into the church. The world is creeping into our message home. Don't anybody want an oldfashioned Holy Ghost revival. I ain't talking about just running and jumping. I'm talking about people getting saved and sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost. Sure, I believe in jumping. But just make sure you live as high as you jump. So it says, "My love, my spouse, how would you like to leave the lion's den? &gt;&gt; How would you like to live Trump's world? How would you like to leave the Democrats world? How would you like to leave the socialists and the communists and &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I know some of you, you're so tied up in politics. I would to God you get that tied up in the word of God for the hour. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for the last Trump. All right. But it's not the one in the White House. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Well, brother Donn, what are you? I ain't neither one. and I ain't never voted in my life. And I don't want to ruin my record now by starting. But I know one thing, God's prophet said, "The devil controls both sides of politics." So whether you're a Democrat or Republican or an independent or whatever you are, I'm telling you one thing, you better be so caught up in the Lord Jesus. And if your party goes off into the world, you better have enough sense to get out of there and say, "God, I don't want to be identified in that trashy mess no more. I want to leave these Craigs. I want to leave these lions dens." Come on, children. We're not waiting for this man to come. Oh, brother Donnie, we need a revival. We need to let this Pentecostal guy, this Baptist guy, what are you talking about? The bride don't feed on Pentecostal. The bride don't feed on Pentecostalism. The bride can feed only on the revealed word of this end time. Does emotion come with it? Yes, it does. Does joy come with it? Yes, it does. But it will not compromise on the word of this hour. If the word of Pentecost would produce a rapture, how come they didn't go years ago? If the Baptist word would produce a rapture, it won't. And it didn't, and it will not today. But we needed an end time message. Hallelujah. And what did God send? Behold, I send unto you, Elijah the prophet, and he shall turn the hearts of the children, Amen, to the fathers, and the hearts of the children back to their fathers again. We have arrived. We are here, friend. Oh my. Look around at your Hermon. Look around at your AMA. Cuz today may be the last day you'll ever see a lion's den. &gt;&gt; If it ain't today, it might be tomorrow. If it ain't tomorrow, it might be next week. But one of these days, you'll never see another lion's den again. Come, oh my tough. So Christ calls men from their present scenes, the present scenes of where they currently are. Maybe you're not in a good spot today. Let the voice of God call you out of where you are. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's calling us away from our first condition. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of our natural birth, calling us from stony places &gt;&gt; and calling us out of the presence of bride killers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. That's what lions are. They're bride killers. &gt;&gt; Leopards are bride killers. &gt;&gt; But let me just let the devil know today, we're devil killers. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are giant killers. Come on, somebody. We're pornography killers. &gt;&gt; We're cancer killers. Amen. Ungodly worldliness killers. That's who we are. &gt;&gt; Remember, our armory is not just a museum that has a lot of Bible stories in it. But in our armory is current events that are going on. In our armory, we have testimonies of last week and week before last that our God is still working miracles and confirming his word like never before. I love to point back to David. I love to point back to Samson. But let me tell you, it's been even more recent than that that I've seen the Lord Jesus do the same thing he's always done. I don't want a dead God. I don't want a God that used to do, used to do, used to do. I need a God that still does it. I need a God that still saves the lost, that still sanctifies, that still fills with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You see, the believer's life, the believer's life is a daily coming &gt;&gt; from Lebanon. This is why Paul could say that I die. &gt;&gt; What was that? His old nature, his old sinful nature? No, it was this he was left in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice Jesus in Luke 9:23. And he said to them all, "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself &gt;&gt; and take up his cross." I'm sure you've read the scripture enough to know that Jesus spoke more about your cross &gt;&gt; than he did his own. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't tell you to take up his cross, &gt;&gt; but yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you see, Leodysia wants you to fully focus on what they say is his cross. &gt;&gt; They point to the cross. They sing about the cross. They teach about the cross. They dream about the cross. They make movies about the cross. The cross. The cross. the cross. But how many of them tell their people they also have a cross? &gt;&gt; But it's like, well, if Jesus bore it, then I don't need to do anything else. That's not what Jesus himself said. &gt;&gt; You're going to have a cross to bear. &gt;&gt; You see, believers redeemed from this present evil world, they take heed so that they don't get caught in bondage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Again. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Read with me if you would in Galatians 5:1. Standf fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. &gt;&gt; with the yoke of bondage. So a person could be free from alcohol and drugs or free from lying, adultery, whatever their vices were. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And pick up some of the same stuff. Still coming to church. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Sitting in the house of God, clapping their hands, worshiping the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I must have had a disconnect. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. &gt;&gt; If this was not possible, Paul would have never wasted time by putting it in the scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stand fast, therefore, in the liberty where with Christ has made us free and be not entangled again. What a terrible thing that a person could be set free and then become entangled again &gt;&gt; by the exact same thing. be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. Second Peter 2:20. For if after they have escape the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein and overcome. That's one thing to be, you know, get your hands tied up or your feet tied up and you're able to break loose and get away. But the longer you stay on &gt;&gt; and the more you play with it, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; And the more you feel like you've got it under control, &gt;&gt; then it's pulling you into its captivity. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And then you become overcome. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hands are tied, feet are tied. You no longer want to go to church. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Your ears are tied. Now you started listening to country music or jazz or blues or R&B or whatever more. And you no longer love Amazing Grace. How sweet the sound. You You'd rather hang around some of your buddies at work than hang around Holy Ghost fil saints. Preach, Brother Donnie. &gt;&gt; You know what's happening to you? You're becoming entangled again and it wants to lead you to bondage. &gt;&gt; Now notice what happens. The latter end is worse with them &gt;&gt; than the beginning. Now friends, how many people have we seen around our message that have fulfilled this scripture? &gt;&gt; There's a lot of scriptures in the Bible I have no desire to fulfill. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These two I read you are two of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Anybody here want to fulfill these? &gt;&gt; It's your choice. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You see, it is the character of our journey. So the journey from Lebanon and the snowcapped mountain of Hermon which is so different than the Galilee so different from Jerusalem. This is where we are. Rugged paths steep precipice crevices craggy. Any of you that's ever been in some of my brothers here from Arizona I see here today and I've hunted with them before and my some in places where we've been together and hunting. I mean, you've got to watch every move. It ain't like a green pasture field of East Tennessee where you're out there walking and the most dangerous thing you run into is a copperhead. That can be pretty dangerous, can't it? But whenever one may one move, you can fall hundreds and hundreds of feet. You understand? This is where we are. It's like we're climbing down a craggy prefaces and we're coming down into a spot in one mismove, one misstep, you can fall for hundreds and hundreds of feet. Ferocious animals all around you. Dogs, two-legged ones. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. The Bible describes them in the book of Peter and also in the book of Revelation. &gt;&gt; Dogs. &gt;&gt; You know what that Greek word is? A male prostitute. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; A male pervert. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're surrounded by dogs. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. And perversion. &gt;&gt; Well, I realize YouTube's already flagged us several times. They'll probably eventually take us off. That's all right. I'd rather stand for the truth. Let my voice ring down for eternity than compromise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see, it's a picture of the passage of a believer from their nativity into their destiny or where we're going. So, manifold temptations mingled with heaviness and sadness. Oh my. the lust of the flesh, lusting against the spirit, and the spirit combating against the flesh. &gt;&gt; And yet all along we're hearing his call. &gt;&gt; Come away, my love. &gt;&gt; I'm coming, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I'm coming. Yes, &gt;&gt; you imagine as here we are and we've heard the bridegroom's call. Brother Joel, we're heading down this steep place where we didn't realize how bad it was until his light illuminated the past. We didn't know how much darkness we were in. &gt;&gt; And now as we're heading toward him, it seems so obscure, such darkness all around us. And our hearts can become gripped with fear if we're not careful. And the most difficult part of the journey at times can be when the path is so narrow. There isn't room for you and your mother and your father and your brother and your uncle and your aunt and your pastor and the deacons to all walk side by side. &gt;&gt; But it's so narrow. &gt;&gt; There's only room for you. And oh yeah, the most important one, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Anybody been there before when it was so narrow &gt;&gt; and so frightening and you look for your mama and she ain't there? You look for your daddy. You look for your best friend and it seems like nobody can help you. But I want you to notice that when they're in this journey, there's great comfort and great aid. Notice how he says this. Chapter 4:8, "Come with me." There it is. There it is. The three words. Come with me from Lebanon. You mean to tell me he left Jerusalem? He left Jerusalem to come and escort me. out of this hell that I'm in every day of my life. &gt;&gt; Notice the invitation. He's inviting you to come as him. It's not you &gt;&gt; come on &gt;&gt; inviting him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's him inviting you. &gt;&gt; Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse. With me from Lebanon. Look from the top of a mana. from the top of Shener and Hermon from the lion's dens and from the mountains of the leopards. Oh, these two precious words with me. With me. I don't care what you're going through today, friend. How low it is, how dark it is. If you're a son or daughter of God, the Lord Jesus will never leave you alone. And you know, as well as I know, sometimes children of God getting some of the biggest message. And a lot of them are self-created. We do it oursel out of our own stupidity and ignorance. And how in the world the Lord would ever love us in spite of all of our ignorance, it's a mystery to me. But he still does. And I'm so glad that he does. I'm telling you one thing. If God had to have a perfect preacher, he'd have never called me because I'm faulty. I'm flawed. I fall short of the glory of God. But there's one thing about it. If I fall down flat in my face, I'm going to get back up again and I'm going to dust myself off and I'm going to say, "Devil, you ain't doing it to me again. I'm going to learn by that mistake. I'm going to get back up. Come on, devil. You want to fight? Let's do it again." Why? Cuz Jesus still loved me. If you're there today and you got your nose all blooded up and your mouth all mashed, let me tell you, our beloved Lord Jesus is standing there by your lion den. He's there in them craggy mountains where the leopards are snarling all around you and your hairs are sticking up on your arm. But let me tell you, we have got another noise. I hear it. It's the shout of the king that's in our camp. We've got a shout among us that says, "Leeper, take your hand off of my daughter. Lion, take your hand off of my son. You cannot have them. They belong to me. Oh my. &gt;&gt; His support all the way through in his everlasting presence that will never leave us. Hebrews 13:5, "Let your conversation be without covetousness, and be content with such things as you have, for he hath said, I will never leave thee. Amen. &gt;&gt; Nor forsake thee. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad? &gt;&gt; Wouldn't we be in a mess today if he said, "Now, I will never leave you as long as you're doing everything I want. &gt;&gt; I'll never leave you as long as you're keeping every word of mine. But if you ever mess up, you're on your own." &gt;&gt; Thank God. He's so merciful. &gt;&gt; Thank God. Look where we are, friend. The world has never been where we are. Our nation has never been where we are. The governments of the world have never been where we are. I'm so glad he hasn't left us here alone. We don't have to try to figure out a way to get out of here. He's done got the way made. It's called a rapture. &gt;&gt; Let's read here in Psalm 27:1. Remember when the prophet preaches the rapture, he uses this for a background. &gt;&gt; Not 1 Corinthians 15, not 1 Thessalonians 4:16. Nothing about the resurrection. Nothing about Matthew 24. Nothing about Luke 21. Nothing about the coming of the Lord. Or so it would seem. But instead, he reads Psalm 27:1 for a background for the rapture. Now, what is a background? Well, right here is what you're seeing right now. This is a background. So there's plants, there's wall panels, there's instruments, there's trim on the wall. That's the background. Hopefully y'all ain't focusing on the background the whole time, are you? &gt;&gt; You're here to hear the word, right? Sing worship and all that. But yet, that is very important. Now, what if we had, you know, just all kinds of weird, dirty, filthy stuff up there? You know, I'm not talking about sinful stuff. I'm just talking about the wall is black and and just smud everywhere. And it'd be so distracting. But it is a background. A background. Whenever we laid it out, we tried to figure it out what would be, you know, would look nice and what would be pairs. I like pairs. I like symmetric. So we tried to look at that and divide the panels and all that. And my wife Carol told me we had had a lot of it done. She said, "Donnie, there's something missing." I said, "Well, what is it?" She said, "You've only got one door on that side, but there ain't no door here." So, Brother Dave Swanson, the brother that sang a while ago, he replicated this door. Now, this door is like a lot of churches. It don't go anywhere. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; It won't open. It won't go anywhere. So, if a fire breaks out, don't try to go out that door cuz you ain't want to get out cuz it don't lead anywhere. It looks just like a door. It's the same size as that door. He even painted the seam around it black so it would look like a door, but it ain't a door. I know you think it's a door, but it ain't a door. Because if it's a true door, it'll go somewhere. What is all of this? a background. So there is a background for the rapture &gt;&gt; and this is it. A psalm of David. &gt;&gt; The Lord is my light and my salvation. &gt;&gt; Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life. Of whom shall I be afraid? &gt;&gt; Now I want you to notice just in one verse he's used the word fear and afraid. So this is the background for the main thing. So what's going to be in the background? Events, things happening &gt;&gt; that are going to cause fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse two. When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes background for the rapture came upon me to eat out my flesh. &gt;&gt; Lions, leopards, man-eing animals. &gt;&gt; They stumbled and fell. Though a host should encamp against me, a host &gt;&gt; against one man. &gt;&gt; A host the background for the rapture. &gt;&gt; Now, was this a mistake? It was prophetic. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was exactly the passages, brother Rob, that we needed for the background of the rapture. Listen, little bride. This is what it's going to be in the hour before we go home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All the leopards and the lions and the onslaught here and there and the other. But remember, even in the background, there is victory for the people of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the wicked, even mine enemies, and my foes, came up to me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I didn't. They did. &gt;&gt; Though in host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. &gt;&gt; Though war, wow. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My look at fear and afraid and enemies and and all of that war. And what is this background for the rapture? I'm not here to scare you today. I'm just here to tell you, get your armor on. &gt;&gt; We're not going to a picnic. We done had that the other night. We're in a battle. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. And you go to looking in your pack. Some of our brothers and and people here in the church was in the military and they could tell you much more about it than I could. But let me describe your military pack. In your military pack, you've got the word. You've got the Holy Ghost. You've got an angelic presence. You've got all kinds of wonderful things to prepare you. But you can look starting right now and look for another thousand years and you ain't going to find no white flag of surrender because the Lord don't equip his people with a white flag. Well, devil, we're going to give up. We're going to give up, devil, we ain't never giving up. We ain't never quitting. We ain't never shutting up. Oh, hallelujah. Why? Because we are the army of the living God. And the background prophecies of our scriptures has already said we have victory. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. Brother, you better believe that's going to take God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And remember, David was a hunter. So he'd go out in the wilderness and spend many days by himself hunting. So we say he went to bed last night. Everything was calm. Everything was fine. He gets up this morning. He's stretching, you know, just waking up and everything. Going to eat a little bit of honey, a little bit of dried fruits and the Mediterranean diet, you know, all the stuff that he brought with him. And he walks out, brother Joe, and splashes his face with a little bit of water and praise the Lord. The Lord is my shepherd and man. Glory to God. And he looks up there and there's a whole host of Philistines or Amorites or Hittites or whoever it was all around everywhere. A whole host against one man. Though host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. Though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. One thing singular your eyes. One thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord. Oh hallelujah. All the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple. Look how when David goes to talking about the house of God and entering into his shikina presence, what's the last verse that he refers to? A war has broke out. A war has broke out. Oh my. And we know that Israel is a type of the brideg. They've been attacked from the north by Hezbollah. They've been attacked from the east and the west by Iran and by all these different people. The only direction they ain't been attacked from is up above this way. And you look, no matter where they are, they're totally surrounded. A little old state about the size of New Jersey. And they've got millions and millions of Arabs against them on every side. So have you little bride. You've got demons against your denominationalism. You've got demons against you. This bunch that's left the message and trying to bring reproach upon it. Come on, somebody. Follow the sign and believe the sign and whatever more. But let me tell you, let me point you up this way. You've got a captain of hosts that's standing up here that says, "Come on, little bride. Come with me out of Lebanon. Come with me out of Shener. Come with me out of Hermmont. Leave the snow behind. Leave the leopards behind. Hallelujah. Leave the lions behind. Little bride. Come on home. [Applause] Now the seal breaks open on a furtherance of her identity spouse because the day of a spousal was over. So now she takes on the name of the work that he has done in her life. He has espoused her and now she becomes that work. Let me find a place to close here in a little bit. &gt;&gt; I told the church not long ago, I said, you know, preachers get up and they said, I'm closing. I'm closing. I'm closing. Said some of y'all may think they're lying, but I say a lot of time preachers got a lot of doors open, so they just shut one door and then they shut another door and then they shut another door. So, I'm on the way of closing. &gt;&gt; Y'all act like you're okay with it anyway, ain't you? Notice verse nine. Thou hast ravished my heart. My sister. Watch her. Now she gets another another title. Sister. It's the first time he's called her this. Watching her relationship as she's walking, getting closer and closer, moving closer to his presence. Thou has ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse. Thou has ravished my heart with one with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck. How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse. How much better is thy love than wine and the smell of thine an ointments than all spices? Thy lips, oh my spouse, drop as the honeycomb. Honey and milk are under thy tongue and the smell of thy garments. It's like the smell of Lebanon. They say one thing that Lebanon is famous for still to this day are the cedars &gt;&gt; of Lebanon. That's right. &gt;&gt; And we know a cedar has two colors of wood, both red and white. &gt;&gt; What does it signify? The cross. &gt;&gt; So the bride is so anointed &gt;&gt; with the campher and the myrr and the sandalwood and all the spices from his presence. And then she has this aroma of the cross. Oh, &gt;&gt; thy lips, so my spouse drop as a honeycomb. Honey, and milk are under thy tongue. And the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon. A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse. A spring shut up, a fountain, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; sealed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Here's the bride going in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sealed. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; By the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She ain't flirting with the devil. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; Uh-uh. She don't want to be married to Jesus and have a a boyfriend call the devil on the side. &gt;&gt; Sleeping around here and sleeping around there like the modern day does. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Not the bride. No, the bride is a garden enclosed. What's happened? He's brought her back again. the restitution of Eden. &gt;&gt; For it was a woman who fell in the Garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It'll be a woman that will be restored not in the Garden of Eden, but in Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where it's so dark and filthy and corrupt. And God will say to her, "You are a garden enclosed." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I know people look at us and say, "Poor things. I feel so sorry for them. They can't do this and they can't do that and they can't go here and they can't go there and they can't wear this and they can't, you know, do this and that and the other. They're just behind walls. They're just they're they're prisoners. They're prisoners. &gt;&gt; Oh, we don't deny that we're not behind walls. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; But what we deny is it's not a prison to us. &gt;&gt; It's a castle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's a castle. It's our king's walls. We are a garden enclosed. Can you imagine friends? As I heard the prophet said this week and I'll close. The reason of this whole dark sinful age is to prove to Satan she's not the type of woman &gt;&gt; that Eve was. &gt;&gt; Help me not to fail, Lord. Song of Solomon chapter 5 verse1 I am come into my garden my sister my spouse I have gathered myrr with my spice I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey I have drunk my wine with my milk yay oh friends drink yay drink abundantly Oh beloved. &gt;&gt; Now here of course is whenever the friend of the bridegroom comes and brings the bride answering to the parable of Matthew 25. And the kingdom of heaven shall be likened unto 10 virgins. Five were wise and five were foolish. You know the story. I'll brief it. At midnight a cry went forth, go ye out to meet the bridegroom, that all of those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps. Then the food is said unto the wise, give us of your oil, for our lamps have gone out. And the wise said, not so, lest we have not enough for ourselves. But go you to them that sell and buy. And while they were gone, behold, the bridegroom came. You see, it was the friend of the bridegroom who knocked on the father's house where the bride was and gave the bride her wedding garments from the groom. &gt;&gt; So, the father, the groom has now commissioned the friend of the bridegroom to go back. And now he's knocking on the door again and he's telling the bride, "Today is the day." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Get ready. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Get your clothes on, girl. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's going home time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. So, the friend leads the pack as they come back and the bridegroom is right behind him. The musicians are blowing on the trumpets. They're playing their symbols. They're Music is being made and here they come. And the bridegroom comes and takes her from her father's house. Takes her now to his house, the new house he built for her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So they have what is called a hoopa which is made out of four poles. So they plant a certain tree when a baby boy is born and plant another tree when a baby girl is born. And when they're going to get married, they cut down that tree and cut it in half. And two legs come from his tree and two come from her tree. &gt;&gt; So the man tree and the woman tree meet together under the trees. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So they come under the tent and he takes the last cup of the wine. A very brief summary of an agreement of their vows. Then he takes her into the bridal chamber. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonder why it is called bridal chamber and not groom chamber. Did you ever wonder why that the man is called the bridegroom instead of the bride being called the bridegroom or the groom bride? Or why is it that the man takes on bridegroom and the bride is just simply called bride? Well, how come she isn't called the groom's bride? &gt;&gt; So, he takes her into the tent and he goes in unto her and then he comes out with the tokens of virginity and he presents them to who? The friend of the bridegroom. Now, this is the recital of Song of Solomon 5:1. Rejoice, oh friends. I have partaken of the wine. I have partaken of this and that. What did he find &gt;&gt; that his bride &gt;&gt; Hallelujah &gt;&gt; was a pure unadulterated &gt;&gt; bride word. &gt;&gt; For here's the proof. &gt;&gt; The blood on the cloth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the friend of the bridegroom w marches out and says, "Rejoice everybody." And you imagine he he had been sitting there sweating bullets as we'd say, "Man alive, if she's not a virgin, he's responsible." But here he comes out and said, "Everything is good. Go tell him. Go tell them." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'll tell you one thing. When I stand there that day, I want to be identified with that friend of the bridegroom. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Let's stand. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Let me share this with you before I let you go. In verse n again, thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse. The word spouse is used six times in the Bible. All six or in the Song of Solomon. Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse. The Latin Vulgate version of this says it this way. Thou hast wounded my heart. Thou hast draw my heart unto thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love the meaning of this word and the way that they wrote it. It means to be robbed of one's will or a power &gt;&gt; or ability &gt;&gt; to think clearly. to be robbed of one's will &gt;&gt; or power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can't you see what moved him to say what he did in the garden of Gethsemane? Nevertheless, not my will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But thine be done. What was it? The love, the love of his life, his sweetheart. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him today? Let's just bow our heads. No doubt as we stand here today and our needs are as diverse as the people who make up this congregation here. And then we have all those that will be streaming and archiving the service and all of that and their needs will be varied as well. But the Lord Jesus knows what you have need of. Maybe you find yourself in the lion's den or the leopards are near you and you're afraid. Maybe you find yourself entangled again. You pick up something that you let go and it's got a hold on you. Maybe you're sealed with the Holy Ghost and you are just waiting on the coming of the Lord. but you just feel like today you need a refreshing in his presence. Maybe you're lost. You've never given your heart to God. The Lord knows exactly what every one of us need. I believe with all of my heart I have the Holy Ghost. I believe I'm born again. But my need today is to be so filled with his presence. How many you Holy Ghost fil people feel that way today? &gt;&gt; Amen. just refreshed, renewed in the presence of God. [Music] Lord Jesus, as we bow our heads to Hermon and Shener and Amanda, where we come from the dust of the earth, we acknowledge our need of you is so great, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. For some, maybe, Father, they've never made a commitment to you, but they feel you dealing with their hearts today. Maybe for some, they've made that commitment, but they've never moved beyond just being saved into sanctification. Maybe some have moved through sanctification, but they've never received the Holy Ghost. You know every need. Father, help us, Lord. I thought I was ready for today. [Music] But you changed me and my direction so I know it was for the needs of your children. Your present father. Oh Jesus, may we hear your call, Father. I want to fight faithful. I've got them scars of them lines all over me. I've got leopard scars on my spirit just like all the rest of these people do. Oh, but I'm waiting for that call. Come away, my love. Leave the lion's dens. Leave the leopard's lair. Lord, come away, my love. Come away, my love. Oh Jesus, help us, Father. I've waited for this day. I could give to you my name. Eternity awaits us. Come away ma. Everybody now. Oh, come away. My love. Are you ready? Come away. You got everything fixed in your heart. You got the Holy Ghost. Are you sealed away? Nothing you need to make right. Nothing you need to fix. &gt;&gt; If you don't, you can make it right right now. Right in this presenceity awaits us. Come away. Oh, hallelujah. My love. Everybody together now. Oh, come away. Come away, my love. Come away, my love. Thank you, Lord Jesus. I've waited for this day when I could give to you my new name, eternity. He awaits us. Come away. My love, would you do me a favor? Would you mind laying your hand over on the person standing by you? Brothers, if it's near a sister and you don't know and you don't feel comfortable in doing that, you can get out and move if you'd like. I want you not praying for yourself now, but for that brother or sister that you're standing by. God alone knows their need. God knows where they are today and what they're going through. Let's just pray together, saints of God. Lord Jesus, your word tells us the effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous man avail much. And we believe it's not just a man but also daughters of God. We have our hands laid one upon the other today. Father, we reach across the aisle or we step out from the aisle to another seat there and be able to touch someone and pray for them. Lord Jesus, you know every need, every desire. Father, maybe some of them find themsel in the lion's den. The den was empty when they went in, but since they've been in there, them lions have filled it up. And if you don't move for them, they'll be gone. They fooled around the leopard's lair when they shouldn't have done it. They sneaked around and caught the leopard gone, they thought. But now the leopard has got them up a tree, got them in a in a den somewhere, and they're scared for their life. Father, may the angels of God sweep through this place today, Lord. I pray in the name of Jesus. Would you minister to the sick? Father, &gt;&gt; would you minister to those that are bound, those that are weary, Father, those that have lost loved ones and still going through the grieving process. I pray for them today, Lord. I pray for those, Father, that aren't born again, for those that still need the Holy Ghost in their soul. Dear God, may this be the day, Lord. We truly see the prophecies of Psalms 27 being fulfilled in our day. But we know we are a people of victory. We are not a people of shame. We are not a people of defeat. Lord God, we believe we are waiting for that call when you will call for us to come away and rise to our Jerusalem. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh blessed father may your presence from the pull pit to the back upstairs where the brothers are there in the internet room and running the sound booth out on the internet Lord Africa Europe wherever they are around the world may the Holy Ghost go into their homes right now Father may the angels of God I pray visit them I just read before I come to church today the prophet said we the reason we don't have more angels visiting homes today is because people's lives are full of television full of the world and full of all kinds of things. And the angels only visit those homes that are worthy, noble homes. Oh Lord, that's the kind of homes that we want. We want our homes, oh Lord, that the angels of God can feel comfortable. We want our church to be a place that the angels of God can feel welcome. Lord, we worship you, Lord Jesus. We bless your name, Holy Father. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
