hearts should we amen it's wonderful for us to be together again tonight in the presence of the Lord but the Timothy person will come and speak for us tonight I want you to just pull on the gift of God and just believe that God's going to speak to us and he has a need a desire request in your heart we know that he's mindful of us it's enough hundreds of us gathered here tonight more than that streaming so God's the only one that can be able to custom fit a message that would be able to help all of us and be able to minister to us we believe he's that kind of a god though don't we to make it so personal that you just know that sermon was directly for you and you only and hundreds of others are sitting there thinking the exact same thing let's just pray together and we'll sing and then ask for the Timothy to come out father we love you so much tonight we're so grateful for the opportunity been given to us Lord Jesus that we could gather together in this place once again Lord we have not come to adore some man we've not come to lift up man but we've come to worship and exalt your precious wonderful name we are so grateful that we're partakers of your divine nature therefore by having your divine nature we've been given your name to share so we're asking tonight that you would help us we've come to bless your name to worship you to exalt you Lord our needs are many the thing goes through many again our God is so much greater just asking once again would you come tonight lord it's our brother comes to speak to us may you anoint him give him the words that we need tonight may we pull father and know that you're mindful of us in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it and the Saints said praise the Lord let's just sing touching Jesus while brother Timothy comes now remember no matter how deep we are how many great things that we think we know I trust we never get to a spot that we think we know so much that we can't have simple Faith to stop the Lord Jesus and if you're here tonight and you've got a need you may have a need to lay outside the confines of what brother Timothy has said you to preach on but you have the ability to be able to touch God and pull him right the direction that you have made you believe that oh woman tried so many Physicians [Music] yet worse so did Jesus she came and when my crown try to restrain the world foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you Lord there's all you want you can touch [Music] oh just believe when you come on his name everybody sing with horse with me now oh touching Jesus is all things foreign [Music] just believe when you call on his name [Music] Hallelujah there's nothing like the touch of the master hey man you know when you look at I was looking at a painting there back in the office just admiring it oh my I'd love to have that gift but when a master takes a pen or it takes a paintbrush he can paint something that nobody else can and when the master gets a hold of your life he can do something with it that nobody else can there's nothing like it's touching man and I'm glad to be here with you we're honored to be here with you in the house of the Lord and I want to bring greetings from our home assembly for my father brother Tim and amen it's just good to be with you this evening traveling with my wife and my daughter and I'm gonna ask her to my daughter to come up and sing for you tonight she's got a soul in our heart something I've asked her to sing as well so amen just to go along with what we have on our heart tonight amen the Healer hasn't lost his touch he's still got it and he met he's still the same yesterday today and forever amen amen so you can be seated she sings [Music] thank you I hear the doubter say you don't see Miracles these days and I'll see some broken ones just waiting for their answers to come to those who've grown weary I've got good news [Music] power still showing up I don't know where I don't know how to know this much [Music] I've been a desperate soul [Music] always crying out to be made [Music] so helpless in that lonely place but I found him faithful I've seen him move this is my story and I'm living [Music] lost his touch [Music] he is [Music] the Healer hasn't lost his touch oh he still restores and he still redeems he still renews and I still believe the Healer he hasn't lost [Music] I don't know when

you have a need why don't you just lift it up to him as we go to him in prayer father Lord we believe we're stepping in a moment predestinated by you father you've seen this service Lord you knew who would be here the heart's need and the hearts cry Lord we just believe father you're still the Healer you're still the deliverer you're still the satisfying portion everything that we have need of you have and so much more Lord you're not just enough you're more than enough Lord tonight we just Commit This service to your hands everything to be said and done for your glory and pure honor Lord we just ask you to move in your own special way touch every hand that was lifted every need behind that hand born we just committed to you Lord we remember Lord sister Erica tonight Lord been on our hearts real heavy this week and just some prayer Just Looking For You Lord to move in a mighty way because you're that kind of God and you do those kind of things we commit this time to you in Jesus name amen amen turn to Luke chapter 9 and verse 12. so that's good it's good to be here with you this evening amen lovely place that you have here I believe this is the Lord's doing and it's marvelous in our eyes amen we're thankful for what God has done for you and giving you this wonderful place to worship him in and and you know I know sometimes people think well you know well I don't know if I had the same Services we had in the old church you know we went through those same things but let me tell you it'll be even greater and even better and even more amen amen God bless you brother Jackie good to see you amen real hero of mine amen Luke chapter 9 and verse 12 it said when the Day begin to wear away then came the 12 and said unto him send the multitude away that they may go into the towns and the country road around about and and lodge and get victims for we are here in a desert place and he said unto them give ye them to eat and they said we have no more but Five Loaves and two fish except we should go and buy meat for all these people for they were about five thousand men and he said to his disciples make them sit down by 50s in a company and they did so and he made them and they made them sit all sit down and he took the Five Loaves and two fish and looking up to heaven he blessed them and break and gave the disciples to set before the multitude and they did eat and we're all filled and there were was taken up of fragments that remained to them 12 baskets amen God bless you and be seated I just want to take for a thought this evening just a moment on the Healer hasn't lost his touch amen I in the scripture reading we read of quite a miracle that took place we uh look at the setting where they were in a desert and away from place that they could easily you know after service or somewhere go to a McDonald's or whatever and get something to eat and they were they were hungry and the disciples were looking around at what they could give and they found Five Loaves and two fish and we know as he took those Five Loaves into fish he began to take them and break them apart and he began to multiply them feed him 5 000 amen plus but you know what a miracle what a miracle that God could bypass uh the the growing and the baking and all you know the fish coming to birth and growing up to a certain size and catching it and then cooking it but he bypassed all of that and he began to break off and as he would break it off another one would appear you know and he you know what a miracle that was and I just want to put to my and put to the thought today that he's still in the miracle working business amen it doesn't matter who says he can't or it doesn't matter how many he says he doesn't do it anymore or it's all gone or it's all in the past that doesn't make it so he's still in the miracle working business amen you know brother Brandon would talk about that because he faced that giant in his day of the days of Miracles are passed and he said the days of Miracles has not passed as says the theologians if the days of Miracles has passed the day of God has passed because God is a miracle amen he said when the day when they say the days of Miracles has passed when the days of Miracles has passed the day of God has passed for God is Miracle certainly the days of Miracles will never be passed never was and never will so doubters say well you don't see many miracles anymore there's you know many have been waiting for a long time for their answer to come and you know in those moments of waiting those are some of the hardest times that you can go in amen but don't get weary because if you if you'll hold on in due season you're going to reap the benefits of what his word said but he says you know I read this scripture today and I I put it here this evening because in Havoc 2 and verse 2 it said the Lord answered and said write the vision and make it plain upon the tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it tarry wait for it because it will surely come and it will not tarry amen so there is a vision that's been put forth before us that we can read in this word amen if you need healing tonight there's a vision for that by his stripes you're healed amen amen all all of your sickness he's taken care of he's already paid the price for all of it amen and so we have a vision so in the threat if you can take that vision and realize it's not just a vision for yesterday but it's right now in the day that we're living him it'll give you strength to run on the journey that the race that you're running amen and so I was looking at this word wait and and weight means to remain in a place of Readiness it's not just sit there and twiddle your thumbs and act like nothing's going on but to remain in a place of Readiness or an expectation that something is about to happen amen and I believe that's where we should be amen as we wait for the Lord to return we're waiting not just in the in the care and the tearing of us going along life's journey and looking over here looking over there nowhere waiting expecting that any moment any time he's going to return again and so if you need healing tonight you need to be in a waiting place and an expectation that it just takes a touch it just takes a moment it just takes just a moment of his touch that and it can all be over with I've witnessed it too many times in my life and I've seen it happen so many times you can go through years of sickness but all of a sudden you'll reach a place face when that vision of that time of fulfillment is to come amen it will not tarry but it'll take place therefore you must be in a time of expectation that any moment any time any service any moment God's going to move God's going to change it God's going to attend or take God's going to answer God's going to heal God's going to deliver any moment I'm waiting for that time amen maybe your sons and daughters are out there away from God but you need to be in a moment of of waiting not not just you know time of giving in due season I'm going to read in due season it's going to come to pass because God's word will not fail we can read in Isaiah 40 about this weight he said Isaiah 40 and verse 28 he said hast thou not known hath thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth I love how he puts that the Everlasting God so in other words this God and His word will last longer than your sickness yeah amen he's the Everlasting God I know sometimes sickness act it feels like it lasts forever but it'll not Outlast Our God Amen it'll not Outlast Our God and His word that is spoken he's an everlasting God he'll last amen his word will remain it'll stand there until every Cancer is defeated every disease is defeated every sin is defeated this God will last Hallelujah not only with us God lasts but you're made to last Hallelujah I can read you of a time of a woman that come before brother Branham under a nervous condition and he's speaking to her and he says look he said that thing's got you down he said but I'm here to tell you you're going to last I ran around my house on that one amen look that Devil's eye has been in some of your ears saying I'm going to overcome you I'm going to take you down I'm going to defeat you but what you need to do is take the word of God and his word says those that are alive and remain I am going to last I'm going to last past sickness I'm going to last past trials come on somebody we are a people that's built to last amen I think about in the last days perilous times shall come last days for who come on it ain't my last days it ain't your last days but I can tell you whose last days is for it's the last days for sickness it's the last days for disease it's the last days for sin it's the last days for every demon of hell and while you're shouting on the Hills of Glory you're going to outlast them Hallelujah he is the Everlasting God Hallelujah he is the creator of the ends of the Earth and he fainteth not praise the name of the Lord this God doesn't give up he's not got the 2022 or 23 and given up on his promises giving up on a bride without spot without wrinkle giving up on his promise of a Healer no sir it doesn't matter how many more diseases come up on this Earth he's still a Healer it doesn't matter how many how many things we go through he's still a deliverer he's still the same yesterday today and forever he fainteth not and neither is he weary and there's no searching of his understanding and he giveth power to the Fates so maybe you're coming to the service tonight and you feel weary and you feel faint well let me tell you there's some power for you to get up and take another step to get up and fight another battle to get up and stand against that devil of hell it says I'm going to take you down I'm going to defeat you I'm going to pull you down no you're not devil I'm going to last past all of your threats past all of your things that you put up on this Earth I'm going to last some of you just need to wave your hand and say devil I'm still here Hallelujah but the years shall feign and be weary and the young men shall utterly fail amen but they that wait upon the Lord not wait upon a good doctor's report not wait upon some something to fear their symptoms of Filth no wait upon the Lord they shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint but we go through seasons of waiting many times we find ourselves in a season of waiting you know we're waiting to come out of a hard situation or or help in a certain situation or maybe some Financial strain or something but no matter what season there's all kinds of seasons of life just like their Seasons that we go through amen you know in Louisiana you can go through all four seasons in one day and sometimes that's the way it is in the Christian Life you can be on a mountain poon down in the valley just like that amen you go through a lot of Seasons but it doesn't matter what season you find yourself in he's still God don't get your eye off for that no matter where you find yourself maybe you find yourself battling the sickness or battling a spirit or or battling depression he's still God [Applause] amen you may be waiting and you may be but listen to the times of waiting are never wasted God is working things out in your life he's moving listen as that song says when you don't see him working he's still working you may not have felt him in a long time but he's still God and he's still moving he's still answering he's still touching he's still orchestrating he is still God before too often we get frustrated with God because things are not happening on our timeline you know therefore we know we think we know better than we than he does we get impatient and in that it leaves the depression and anxieties and fears but God is in control of everything that is happening it doesn't matter what's going on in this world he's in control he raises up Kings he taketh down Kings he's in control of it amen he's in control of every season of your life every moment of your life Ecclesiastes Ecclesiastes 3 and 11 says he has made everything beautiful in his time I know we want our time and we want it to me you know we're living a very fast age right now and everything you know needs to be very quickly and we want it very quickly you know got to have a microwave gotta have this it's very quickly if it ain't quick enough then we get frustrated but God wants us in his time but in his time when the vision is to be fulfilled you can line every devil up and it will not keep it from coming to pass Hallelujah when it's time or a vision to be fulfilled for someone's healing you can lie in every devil and hell up and they'll not keep it from coming to pass but it will be fulfilled it will happen just like he said Psalms 31 and verse 15 and 16 says my times are in your hands deliver me from the hand of my enemy from those that pursue me but whatever my time is in your hand we read it just a while ago in habakkuk 2 the vision is for the appointed time Ecclesiastes 8 says there is a proper time and procedure for every Delight Ecclesiastes three and one says there are time for everything in the season for everything Galatians 6 those in verse 9 says let us not become weary and well doing for in the proper time we will reap a harvest if we don't give up foreign am I talking to some people tonight that's not going to give up amen God's not going to give up he's not going to give up on his promises he will fulfill him every time in his time but he's looking for somebody that'll stand there no matter how dark he gets no matter how gloomy it gets and say it's God's word and I'm holding on to it [Applause] yeah it's in his time no but no matter how long has been or how much time has passed God is still God he is still on the throne and he hasn't lost his touch what he did yesterday he still does today he's still the almighty he's still the same yesterday today and forever his power is still showing up it's still healing it's still delivering [Music] see this right here this is a testimony right here he's still healing he's still delivering just Saturday night in the prayer line that we I've been suffering with his shoulder for years and years I couldn't hardly lift it up and I and I would you know go to raise my hands and I'd have to move it around just to get it up and like that and so in the prayer line I was kind of behind in the back a little bit and brother Ron looked at me said go to the front I go to the front not knowing what's going on brother Ronnie long is standing at the very front he lays his hand on my shoulder and the voice spoke to him he said have him pray for you said brother Ronnie the Lord just says have you pray for me my shoulder is bad and I need healing he began to pray and he said Lord you know just last year I had the same problem in the same shoulder and you healed me [Music] and then he still does today he hasn't lost his touch he's still the same God with the same power and the same Authority hey I don't know it doesn't matter how dark it may seem how impossible it is to get a hand up it does not matter as long as you just keep putting it up and saying God I'm going to praise you no matter what's going on around me I'm going to worship you I'm going to glorify you I'm going to give you praise in spite of my sickness in spotting my struggle and passed by them all that's around me I know that you have the answer and you can touch me and it'll be over with thank you he hasn't lost his touch just a few weeks ago I just drop us in a few weeks ago I was well let me back up a couple years ago I actually was looking into going to business had it all planned out had it all figured out and things seemed to be falling in place I was on my way up to brother Ron's to preach for him and went by his house for Saturday is when he's having Saturday evening and Sunday evening service and so I was preaching both Services went Saturday to his house for a meal Saturday night he come and he said well it's going to be a good weekend you know how he does he says broadcast I said yeah I'm looking forward to it he said for you say oh my you know in my mind I've got these plans right and I thought wow you know I know he had spoke to different ones about businesses and this is what I'm looking at and expecting we got up on the mountain on Sunday afternoon there before I went up there for lunch before the service Sunday evening and we can look at looking over these beautiful landscaping and he pulls me aside he said this is the place and he begins to talk to him and he said you know I talked to this one brother Aiden up there in Ohio and I talked to this one over and God has blessed them he said but that's not you and I hadn't told him anything about what's going on but apparently somebody else did and he said I went yesterday after you left my house I went to take a nap and said I couldn't sleep went to my office and the Lord just spoke to my heart said tell him don't go into business that's not what's that's not his lot but he's a servant of mine and I will take care of him and you know what that that I've seen things change very rapidly was I as I watched it and God just began to provide and things begin to move in the you know the good direction went on for several years but just a couple months ago I saw things begin to turn the other way see you go through seasons of your life but God's wanting to test you to see if you really believe what he said if you really believe that was God that was speaking to you he's going to test you on it it can come from a man or it can come from this book God will test you if you really believe what he said amen so I begin to watch things very rapidly to deteriorate you know financially and things and I was just and then my wife has been going through some issues health-wise and all kinds of stuff going on and so just a couple weekends ago it'd be just accumulated to a point that I just come to a breaking spot and I just got I got through leading to singing at church and I went to the back and I just said Lord I don't know what's happening but help me right now to not move from what you have said help me not to get bitter about it you know how the devil is why can't you do this how come you can't do this you got talent you can do this what about the job you're left to go Minister look what they're paying now all kinds of things going through my mind and so I'm I'm I'm just coming to this moment well Monday morning I get up and the day goes and sister Ruth are taking a walk with some of the girls to come back by the mailbox grab the mail come in the house and and handed me an envelope and I said wow there was it and I looked at it opened it up it was a card nice card and it said just just a note of Thanksgiving to someone who touched our lives and I don't remember exactly right here don't have it before me and said and open it up and said just take this as a gift of appreciation and I'll flip that over check over it wasn't just enough it was more than enough you know brother Donnie I got to realize that I hadn't been home on Friday hadn't been home on Saturday and we got to realizing the mail hadn't even run yet on that Monday morning that check had been probably in there already in the mailbox while I was crying out to God while I was in my nervous cross while I was having a questions why the devil was talking to me the answer was already in the mailbox and the whole time no doubt what God was saying just go to the mailbox just go out there and I was bypassing you know hey y'all I don't like going to a mailbox because there's always bills in there but now it's kind of changed my mind about a mailbox amen but I I I I I it was already laying there and I thought God how many times are we crying out and wonder and frustrated and it's already in the mailbox there's a love letter that's been wrote to you and it's got promise after promise after promise just go to the mail open it up and say God I accept it right now I take it as my heart this is my inheritance his power is still showing up let me read you a couple testimonies really quick nerves are still being healed pain is still even bodies God hasn't lost this touch broken bones are being put in place no surgery needed just recent things that have taken place amen pain leaving people's bodies see God hasn't lost his touch I know what he can do I felt that I've witnessed it and I found him faithful I've seen him move he hasn't lost his touch he's still the unchanging God he still restores he still heals he still redeems and no matter how many dollars Say It Ain't So I still believe I still believe [Applause] there's something about the touch of a Healer of the Healer let's read about it really quick in several scriptures here you don't have to keep up with me there but if you want to you can Luke Chapter 2 7 and verse 12. so when it came now to the gate of the city behold there was a dead man carried out the only son of his mother and she was a widow can you imagine the pain and much people of the city was with her and when the Lord saw her he had compassion on her and said unto her weave not and it came and touched the bar the casket and they that bear him Stood Still and he said young man I say unto thee arise and he that was dead sat up and began to speak and he delivered him to his mother [Music] yeah listen if I had a son or a daughter that was out and dead and sin and trespasses and iniquities I would not give up because he knows exactly where they're at and all he's got to do is come and just touch them we just had a man come just a few days ago amen he said listen he said I had no desire to come back to God I had walked away from the house of God I had no desire to come back he said when I went to my office and I laid down for just a moment to take a nap and I heard a voice saying this is your time to come home and he said I jumped up and I came home he's still that kind of God I would not give up on him all it takes for him to see it's your turn right right it's your turn maybe it's somebody in this service right here tonight it's your turn you've been backsliding away from God and Dad it's your turn Matthew 8 and verse 3 said Jesus put forth his hand and touched him saying I will be thou clean and immediately the leprosy was clean touch Just a Touch Matthew 8 and verse 14 said Jesus came to Peter's house and he saw his wife's mother laid sick of a fever and he touched her hand and the fever left her and she arose and ministered unto them Matthew 9 28 said when he came to the house a blind man came to him and Jesus said believe you that I'm able to do this and they said unto him yea Lord and then touched he their eyes and the court said according to your faith be it unto you and their eyes were open Just a Touch Genesis 32 and verse 25 said when he saw talking about Jacob when he saw that he prevailed not against the angel he touched the hollow of his eye and we know what happened and from that moment he walked different he had a name change and it'll take years of repentance it just takes a moment [Applause] and you'll walk different you'll talk different you're act different just from being in his presence and him touching you oh God May Touch Somebody tonight Daniel 8 in verse 18 says now as he was speaking with me I was in deep Sleep on my face toward the ground but he touched me and he set me upright and said behold I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation when for at the time appointed the end shall be amen but we all go through as I've been saying seasons of life times where God seems so far away you know winter seasons honestly is not my favorite season of the year some people love it but but listen you don't change seasons what happened you're just to them you can't change the season if you wanted to so you put a coat on but you put that coat on not expecting to wear it forever amen you don't expect it to stay that way forever amen because Seasons don't last they change [Applause] amen Seasons don't last they change the good news is about winter spring is on the way Suddenly It's spring and the season has changed and you don't even know how you made it through winter but all of a sudden flowers are blooming trees are blooming birds are singing and it's freeing again you might be in a time of winter right now but don't worry you're not going to stay there it's going to change amen listen God don't leave you there always but suddenly things can change suddenly sorrow can turn to Joy suddenly amen chains can fall off and freedom be released suddenly you're buried and the next day you're full of life understand healing is a process but there's a time healing becomes suddenly becomes the day I mean you can go months and it'd be healing and all of a sudden there's a day and it's over with I mean no we know a miracle it could just be just boom it's done same both but God works in both I don't not trying to diminish any of them they're all God how God wants to orchestrate that's up to him but suddenly things can change very quickly in your life amen it just takes a touch amen where's this word at well let's read about Acts chapter 2 and verse 1. it said when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there were days leading up to this but suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house that we're setting suddenly one went from being a denier to a preacher of the Gospel of Jesus Christ follow the Holy Ghost in power when you read in Acts chapter 9 and verse 2 with Saul who became Paul but he's on his way to Damascus and the scripture says suddenly they're shined around him about a light from heaven so in one moment he's on his high horse the next moment he's on the dirt I want to tell our critics suddenly things going to change [Applause] you might be on a high horse right now and you're carrying out threats and persecution but let me tell you it can change very quickly [Applause] amen and he fell to the Earth and he heard a voice saying Saul Saul why persecutes me thou me and he said who art thou Lord he said I'm Jesus whom I persecuted and he said arise and go in the city shall be told what to do it changed very quickly very suddenly Just a Touch Acts chapter 16 and verse 25 it says at midnight Paul and Silas pray and sang Praises unto God and the prisoners heard them and suddenly now this wasn't exactly the time they really felt no doubt like praising God it wasn't that they just came to this spot and they thought man things have been going so good today I feel like lifting up my hands and I know they had chains on they had been beat they had went through a lot of problems and persecution but Paul was sitting over there by Silas and he looked at Silas blood running down his cheek and he said Silas I feel like praising praising him [Applause] that'll turn a devil on his ear like someone who's been through the mud on a Wednesday and been through trial after trial and been through problem after problem but all of a sudden they say you know what I'm going to look past all of that and I'm going to sing praises to my God and I'm going to give him glory and I'm going to give him honor and I'm going to give him what he deserves you want your chains broken go ahead and start praising him you won't deliver it's from yourself go ahead lift your hands and say I praise the mighty name of Jesus and suddenly there was a great earthquake and the prison was shaken and immediately same word all the doors were open and everyone's bands were loosed you know why because two on a Wednesday night said you know what I feel like praising God it doesn't matter what I've been through God God's been with me it doesn't matter how low I've been God was still there it doesn't matter the sickness I've been dealing with God's been with me why shouldn't I praise him why shouldn't I glorify him it'll not only set you loose it'll set everyone loose that scripture for it immediately your season can change a touch can change come in just a moment Matthew 8 and verse 2 said behold there came a leper and worshiped him he didn't just worship him after being cleansed he was a leper hurting Skin Rotten and he worshiped him saying Lord if thou wilt thou can't make me clean and Jesus put forth his hand and touched him saying I will be thy clean and immediately his leper what leprosy was cleansed Mark chapter 1 and verse 29 says it like this and four with when they come out of the synagogue they entered the house of Simon and Andrew and James and John but Simon's wife mother lay sick with a fever a nun they tell her of him and he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up and immediately the fever left her takes a touch lombardimaeus he had his moment Jesus come walking through there was critics it was around him there was all kind of people saying all kinds of things and blind martyr man said who is that coming they said that's Jesus of Nazareth oh sorry scumbag ain't nothing but an illegitimate child Jesus foreign have mercy on me come on man you you need to just keep quiet you know he can't do nothing and listen I done heard what he's done more to me and said look if you was blind as I am you would want to be with him as well you know it's a paradox and a blind man had more Revelation than people that could see with these eyeballs amen but he knew he had to get in his presence and they begin to try to tell him sit down shut up we don't you're making too much noise and he said the scripture says he hollered even that much the more because he knew this is my opportunity and I forget another one this is my moment and I may not ever get another one God if we could have that same desire that same passion this is my moment and I may not get another one have mercy on me and I love if he said Jesus Stood Still brother Brandon talked about he said he said that Christ stopped heaven your Christ stops heaven listening to your cry amen amen you know I know it seems like it takes you know it's been a long time things have been a lot longer than we expected a lot I haven't heard it on the first day the answer's on the way the answer is on the way don't you know don't get out of line for your miracle hey man the answer is on the way and he went he went and said Jesus has called for you you know what he did he Cast Away His Garment I like that you know why Cast Away that garment because he knew he was going to go and he wouldn't have to come back and be a beggar no more [Applause] [Music] he knew he was going to go to Jesus and it was all going to be over with that was the faith that was in this blind man he said well I don't need this garment no more I don't need it no more and he throwed it away listen he wasn't there to worship his feelings worship his problems worship His situation he was there to worship one thing and that was Jesus Christ we know he was healed the woman having the issue of blood spent all of her living on the Physicians couldn't be healed of any came behind him and touched so you have a touch too it's a touch of faith she pressed through all those critics all of those others and she was there bleeding out about to die and she pressed through all of it because if I can just touch and she touched him and immediately her issue of blood stopped my God to God that we serve is a powerful God [Applause] we can read about Paul or Peter as he went to the gate called Beautiful and there was a man there begging arms and he said silver and gold eye by none but such that I have give out to thee and they took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength this God is still in the healing business and just a moment things can change just preaching on this and just interject a little bit of it but Israel got taken into captivity and we know the scripture in Psalms where it says we couldn't sing the songs of Zion no more I said because you know it's taken out of our land of promise and it just wasn't we had to put our harps on the willow tree and all of that but you know there was a time that they were there but there was also a time they left see God raises up Kings and he'll take it down Kings he allows things to rise up in the epig terrorism right back down amen if a while thou walls to come around but then when he's ready for somebody to be set free he'll tear walls down amen and we can read about it when they got released it said in Psalms 126 and 1 said when the Lord turned again the Captivity of Zion we were like them that dream it was like we was in a dream this is so good it feels like I'm dreaming and he said then was our mouth filled with laughter and her tongues were singing then said they among the Heathen the Lord hath done great things for them God had done so much that it had to make the Heathen testify amen the Lord hath done great things for them the Lord hath done great things for us wherever we are glad he's turned again our captivity O Lord as the streams of the South and they that sow in tears shall reap in joy Hallelujah you've been sowing in tears don't worry there's a touch coming and you're going to reap in joy you've been going to bed crying but in the morning Joy comes it comes it's a refreshing from the presence of almighty God they that sow in tears shall reap in Joy he that goeth forth and weepth bearing precious seed shall doubtless come again with rejoicing bringing in the sheaves listen God is not interested and you're just having one little seed he's interested in you having a harvest of seeds so you've been bearing this seed of promise and you've been bearing it with tears of weeping but all of a sudden it's changed and the change comes by the touch of the master and it goes from weeping to Joy and it goes from one sea to a harvest Hallelujah I'm looking at a people that have that's reaping the Harvest of God's blessings and let me tell you it's only just beginning it's only just forgetting I would say God pour it out pour out your healing pour out your deliverance pour out the Holy Ghost pour out your spirit pour out the Unspeakable Joy of almighty God and let his soul fill our hearts that it's not just a trickle but it's a gusher of the Holy Ghost pouring down into our lives until it changes ever father it changes every mother it changes every child it changes every one of us till we take that moment of that body change [Applause] Psalms 30 and verse 1 says I will extol thee O Lord for thou Has Lifted Me Up and has not made my foes to Rejoice over me O Lord my God I Cried unto thee and thou has healed me oh Lord thou has brought up my soul from the grave thou has kept me alive that I should not go down to the pit sing unto the Lord oh you Saints of his give thanks to the remembrance of his Holiness for his anger endureth for a moment but in his favor his life weeping may endure for the night but joy cometh in the morning joy cometh in the morning and in my Prosperity I said I shall never be moved Lord by the favor that has made my Mountain to stand strong thou let us hide thy face and I was troubled I Cried unto thee O Lord unto the Lord I made supplication what prophet is there is my blood when it goes down in the pit shall the dust praise thee shall it declare thy truth hear O Lord have mercy on me Lord be thou my helper [Music] but thou has turned my morning into dancing and thou has put off my sightcloth and girded me with gladness to the end of my glory may seem praise to thee and not be silent O Lord my God I will give thanks unto thee forever Just One Touch One Touch of the master one day sinners the next day save Sons and Daughters of God one moment sick the next moment healed one moment lost the next moment found we have been brought back to the land of Our Father Abraham it is a land of faith this we

joys of the Lord I long to hear that on that day look at this it's bringing this down we go back what he did before he still does today and he hasn't lost his touch he showed it in the scriptures

baskets left over showing his Jehovah Jireh he's not just enough he's more than enough he knew exactly how many people was there and he knew exactly how much food it would have took he wasn't bad

hearts they compelled him to come inside and they began to talk to them and the scripture says he took the bread and as he break it it opened up their eyes now pardon me I don't feel like it was a certain way he held it and it was a certain way he tore it I believe when he tore it another piece took its place [Applause] can hold a piece of bread any man can tear it apart but there's only one I
