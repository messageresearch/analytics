[9:00] Like where I long [singing]
[9:03] to be. There'll be no tears
[9:08] to fill our [music and singing] eyes
[9:11] again.
[9:15] The hills will go with the story as we
[9:20] [music] sing of his grace and glory.
[9:25] Where the saints of God will be.
[9:30] That sounds [music]
[9:33] like
[9:35] to me. Sing [music] it one more time.
[9:38] That sounds like good to me.
[9:43] Mark where I [music and singing]

[23:10] There's no secret. [music] I just held
[23:15] on [singing]
[23:18] and I held on [music]
[23:22] till the storm was over.
[23:27] I don't claim to be a hero [music]
[23:31] and I [singing] don't have all the
[23:34] answers, [music] but I held on

[23:41] was over.
[23:44] Not because I'm good. Not [music]
[23:47] because I'm great. Not because I'm

[25:14] And I don't claim [music and singing] to
[25:16] be a hero.
[25:18] And I don't have [singing] all the
[25:21] answers. But I held on [music]
[25:26] till the storm was over. [singing]
[25:31] Not because [music]
[25:32] I'm good. Not because I'm great.
[25:35] [singing]
[25:35] Not because [music] I'm strong, but I
[25:40] held on.

[25:48] you're seated. [applause]

[30:07] sing his song as he comes out.
[30:15] We are standing
[30:23] on holy
[30:25] [singing] ground.
[30:29] [music]
[30:31] And I [singing] know that there
[30:36] are angels
[30:38] [music]
[30:39] all [singing]
[30:40] around.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; [music]
[30:46] &gt;&gt; Let us praise
[30:53] Jesus. [singing]
[30:56] Now
[31:01] we [music]
[31:02] [singing] are standing
[31:04] in his [music] presence on holy
[31:09] [singing]
[31:11] ground. [music]
[31:15] Oh, we [singing and music]
[31:17] are standing
[31:23] on holy [music]
[31:25] [singing] ground.
[31:31] [music]
[31:31] And I know
[31:40] Heat. Heat. [music]
[31:56] [music]
[32:09] &gt;&gt; [music]
[32:10] &gt;&gt; We just raise our hands, close our eyes.
[32:15] Oh, [music]
[32:16] we
[32:18] are standing.
[32:23] Thank you, Father, [music] for this
[32:24] privilege.
[32:27] We can stand at this sacred nest [music]
[32:29] tonight, Lord, in this sacred place
[32:34] to sing, [music]
[32:36] to worship, to magnify you, Lord Jesus.
[32:41] We believe your angels are in this place
[32:43] tonight. Lord God, [music]
[32:46] let us pray.
[32:53] Let us love [music] and praise him now.
[32:58] [music]
[33:00] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[33:03] [music]
[33:04] We're standing in
[33:07] his presence on holy
[33:11] ground.
[33:18] Praise the Lord.
[33:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:20] I believe
[33:22] that awesome presence
[33:25] that we experienced this past weekend,
[33:28] especially Sunday.
[33:31] I was thinking about it today that I
[33:34] hoped our church
[33:36] realized what was causing that.
[33:40] The angels of God were among us.
[33:45] Yeah, we're here to energize,
[33:47] &gt;&gt; to strengthen,
[33:49] to help us.
[33:52] Aren't you glad we have a church where
[33:56] angels can visit?
[34:01] &gt;&gt; I hope you have a home that angels also
[34:05] can visit cuz they certainly desire to.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; [cough and clears throat]
[34:09] &gt;&gt; I just want to say how much we
[34:11] appreciated brother Matt being with us
[34:13] and just him submitting himself to the
[34:15] Lord. And I was so blessed by our
[34:18] brother and I'm sure that many of you
[34:20] were as well. Just appreciate him
[34:22] getting out of the way and coming. And I
[34:25] was just thinking again this week of
[34:27] another another youth service, another
[34:31] time that the Lord has made a way for
[34:33] us. And I was thinking it hasn't been
[34:36] that long really to where we couldn't
[34:38] have those.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; We couldn't have no special meetings cuz
[34:43] we didn't have a place big enough. But
[34:46] Jesus is mindful of us.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad? Aren't you glad
[34:52] we can have such meetings?
[34:54] [clears throat] Thank the Lord.
[34:55] [applause]
[34:58] Praise the Lord.
[35:00] Amen. Let's turn to Genesis 24 tonight.
[35:03] if you would. Genesis 24:E1
[35:09] and remember
[35:11] our setting
[35:14] of it being a type of God
[35:19] sending forth a messenger to get a bride
[35:23] for his son.
[35:26] And Abraham was old and wellstricken in
[35:29] age. And the Lord had blessed Abraham
[35:33] in all things.
[35:35] And Abraham said unto his eldest servant
[35:38] of his house that ruled over all that he
[35:42] had.
[35:43] Now, I'm sure that people think God's
[35:47] servants aren't really that important.
[35:50] We know there's people that feel that
[35:51] way. And you know, you can make it with
[35:54] or without them. It's no big deal. But
[35:58] maybe whenever you get to heaven, you
[36:01] could go up to Rebecca and ask her if it
[36:04] was a pretty big deal
[36:08] &gt;&gt; about listening to that man.
[36:13] He ruled over all that he had. And he
[36:15] told him, "Put, I pray thee, thy hand
[36:17] under my thigh, and I will make thee
[36:20] swear by the Lord, the God of heaven,
[36:24] and the God of the earth. Thou shalt not
[36:27] take a wife unto my son, of the
[36:31] daughters of the Canaanites among whom I
[36:35] dwell."
[36:36] Now, let me just say this tonight for
[36:38] our young people and anyone else,
[36:40] whether you're young or not, that's
[36:42] looking for a a companion, a mate
[36:44] [clears throat] in life. As your pastor,
[36:47] I'm not trying to tell you don't marry
[36:49] this one, don't marry that one, don't
[36:50] marry unbelievers, don't marry that
[36:52] because I'm trying to be mean to you or
[36:55] because I'm trying to control your life.
[36:59] What I'm trying to do is spare you of a
[37:02] life of hell
[37:04] &gt;&gt; being married to a Canaanite,
[37:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[37:10] &gt;&gt; And so with your mom and dad,
[37:13] but thou shalt go unto
[37:16] my country
[37:18] and to my kindred,
[37:22] and take a wife unto my son. So here's
[37:25] the three my
[37:30] country,
[37:31] my kindred, my son.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; So to me, that's a my my my.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; Right. I ain't too smart, but ain't that
[37:42] what you get out of that? My my my.
[37:46] That's how important is to God for you
[37:48] to marry a real word believer.
[37:53] And the servant said unto him, prayer
[37:55] adventure the woman will not be willing
[37:56] to follow me into this land, lest thy
[37:59] needs bring thy son again unto the land
[38:03] from which thou camest. And Abraham said
[38:05] unto him, Beware,
[38:08] beware. This is not a game.
[38:12] Well, maybe it'll work. I I just I feel
[38:14] it'll be okay. Beware.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Beware that thou bring not my son
[38:19] thither again.
[38:21] The Lord God of heaven, which took me
[38:23] from my father's house, and from the
[38:26] land of my kindred, and which spake unto
[38:29] me, and that swear unto me, saying, Unto
[38:32] thy seed will I give this land.
[38:36] He shall send his angel before thee, and
[38:40] thou shalt take a wife unto my son from
[38:44] thence." Now, I'm not sure what you hear
[38:46] when you hear this read, but I'll tell
[38:49] you what, Ellie Ezer heard prophecy.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Prophecy.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; So, he's asking him, "So, what am I
[38:59] supposed to do if I go there and I go
[39:01] through all this thing that you've told
[39:02] me to do and she won't come?" He said,
[39:04] "He shall
[39:07] send his angels before thee, and thou
[39:10] shalt
[39:12] no may, no perhaps, possibly. Well, if
[39:15] it don't work out, no big deal. His
[39:18] angel will go before you, and you will
[39:20] bring back that bride."
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And thou shalt take a wife unto my
[39:28] son from thence. So I knew exactly where
[39:33] the bride was coming from.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; You know, really Jesus is not asking for
[39:39] that hard of a thing in this day. He
[39:41] wants a bride from among his people.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; But everybody that goes to church ain't
[39:47] his people.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; Everybody that believes that they're
[39:50] Christians aren't his people.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; But they got to be of the same father
[39:55] &gt;&gt; and the same seed.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; And the same nature.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Aren't you glad?
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; By his grace, he's made a way that we
[40:03] can be that way.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; How many like to be remembered tonight
[40:06] as we pray? You got a need, a request on
[40:08] your heart, a sickness, a burden,
[40:11] whatever it is, just hold it there in
[40:12] your heart, would you?
[40:14] Heavenly Father, we count it such a
[40:18] privilege, Lord Jesus, to be assembled
[40:22] once again in this house that you have
[40:26] given to us.
[40:28] again. My father, I want to say thank
[40:31] you. I know they probably hear me say it
[40:35] over and over again, and maybe it don't
[40:37] mean the same to them as it does to me,
[40:40] but I just want you to know how grateful
[40:44] I am that we can be able to host
[40:47] meetings and be able to have banquetss
[40:50] and youth services. And Lord, it did my
[40:54] heart so good to see youth here from the
[40:58] Carolas and Virginia and Arizona and I I
[41:01] I don't even know where all they were
[41:03] from. And I I'm just I'm just grateful,
[41:07] Lord,
[41:08] &gt;&gt; because I believe it was you that gave
[41:10] us this building and you wanted us to be
[41:13] able to host meetings. I want to thank
[41:16] you for all the work that the people
[41:18] done here, Lord, and everything that
[41:20] they have done to make the people
[41:22] welcome. And I just pray, Father, that
[41:25] you'd help us as long as as long as
[41:27] we're here that we can continue to do
[41:29] so. Now, here we've come again on
[41:32] Wednesday night. Most the visitors that
[41:34] went back home and it's just us, us home
[41:37] folk, but we realize it's regular home
[41:40] folk services that actually leads up to
[41:43] them special services. I believe with
[41:45] all of my heart every service can be a
[41:48] special one if we'll believe that it
[41:50] will be thus.
[41:52] So once again, we're looking for you to
[41:54] speak to us tonight. Lord God, may the
[41:57] angels of God come near us now, Father.
[42:02] May they find their place
[42:05] standing near your children.
[42:08] No doubt the war will begin. It already
[42:11] has. But as the word goes forth with the
[42:15] sword, then no doubt it intensifies.
[42:19] May the spirit of God minister to your
[42:22] children tonight, Lord. We pray in the
[42:25] name of Jesus. And the saints said,
[42:29] &gt;&gt; "Amen." God bless you. You may be
[42:32] seated.
[42:37] So a father that would want to give a
[42:40] dowy to his daughter
[42:45] and he had the means by which he could
[42:48] give her unlimited resources.
[42:53] He could provide for her whatever he
[42:55] felt that she would need as she is
[42:59] beginning this new life together with
[43:03] her husband.
[43:05] He would give her no doubt whatever he
[43:08] felt that she would be required to have
[43:12] if they needed a start financially.
[43:15] No doubt he would. If they needed a
[43:18] better vehicle to be able to get about,
[43:21] a mode of transportation,
[43:24] no doubt he would. If he could give them
[43:28] advice,
[43:30] if he could give them some teaching,
[43:34] some things that would be a deposit that
[43:36] would help them in their new life
[43:39] together. No doubt he would do that. But
[43:42] what if that father
[43:45] had the ability to give to his daughter
[43:50] as part of her dowy?
[43:54] Angels
[43:56] from another realm
[43:58] that would accompany them their entire
[44:01] journey in life.
[44:05] Not only would they be beside them,
[44:09] but every now and then he would let some
[44:12] of his children
[44:15] actually break
[44:18] into angelic language
[44:23] &gt;&gt; and they would talk
[44:26] angelic tongues.
[44:31] And then whenever they would be in such
[44:34] straits
[44:36] at times that they didn't know what to
[44:38] do
[44:40] and they would need a real surge,
[44:44] he would send the angels down near them
[44:48] and they would be at a spot that they
[44:50] felt they couldn't go any farther.
[44:53] And all of a sudden, it wasn't seen. It
[44:56] wasn't tangible. It wasn't visible.
[45:00] But somehow another from a certain time
[45:05] they just felt different.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; It wasn't like maybe they felt like they
[45:10] could run through a wall or, you know,
[45:13] leap great leaps and bounds, but it was
[45:17] just something from within them that
[45:20] they felt they was going to be okay.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; Well, I know one thing. If I had the
[45:27] ability to give that to my two
[45:30] daughters,
[45:31] oh, I certainly would have.
[45:35] I wasn't a rich man when evil either one
[45:37] of my daughters got married and still am
[45:40] not. But I did try to help them.
[45:44] I tried to give them advice along the
[45:46] way.
[45:48] I would try to do anything that I could
[45:52] to help them,
[45:54] but I'm so limited.
[45:57] But what if you were God
[46:02] and you had access to everything that
[46:06] was good,
[46:08] everything that was righteous,
[46:11] everything that was pure.
[46:15] And you make up this plan actually
[46:18] before the foundation of the world.
[46:23] So you know that your children will be
[46:26] brought on the earth after Adam and Eve
[46:29] and unregenerate states and they'll be
[46:32] facing so many things in life. So you
[46:36] predetermine
[46:38] that you will allow their angel
[46:45] to stand before your throne
[46:49] as a representation of them
[46:53] while they are absent from that body.
[47:00] You will actually allow your children
[47:03] once they come into their new land of
[47:06] the new birth
[47:08] to be encompassed by an innumerable host
[47:14] of angelic beings
[47:17] &gt;&gt; and they will actually busy themsel
[47:23] over you.
[47:26] Well, I'll tell you one thing. If I had
[47:28] that kind of power, I'd certainly would
[47:30] allocate it to my young ones.
[47:34] I don't know of a thing that you could
[47:36] give to them after you redeem them.
[47:40] And then
[47:42] father decided
[47:44] to make these beings to be an immediate
[47:49] relation
[47:51] to the individual.
[47:54] Watch this. In Matthew 18:10, "Take heed
[47:57] that you despise not one of these little
[48:01] ones.
[48:03] For I say unto you that in heaven
[48:08] their angels do always behold the face
[48:13] of my father
[48:16] which is in heaven." Their
[48:20] angels do always behold
[48:24] the face of my father
[48:27] which is in heaven. Now to me this is
[48:29] absolutely overwhelming
[48:32] since no man has ever seen the face of
[48:37] God.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; But your angel has. Amen.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Now, actually, what is your angel?
[48:49] Question answers 61. Mistreat a child.
[48:53] You should never do that. They're
[48:55] children. They don't know. See, and now
[48:58] notice, because their angels
[49:02] always behold my father's face which is
[49:06] in heaven. In other words,
[49:09] their angels,
[49:11] their their messengers,
[49:16] their bodies,
[49:19] angelic bodies
[49:24] that they go to
[49:27] if they die.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; You see, God believes in predestination.
[49:37] So he ordains your angel to be there
[49:40] before you'll ever get there in a
[49:41] corporal body.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; So if you've got an angel there, sounds
[49:45] like to me your destiny is pretty
[49:47] secure.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; I told you your Sunday after brother
[49:50] Matt preached, your name's already
[49:52] there. You got a body already there.
[49:54] Sounds like to me you're going to be
[49:56] there.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Now notice what your angel then, this
[50:01] one is.
[50:04] Now this is not your guardian angel.
[50:08] This is your angel.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; You see there are angels of the Lord
[50:17] but there's only one angel of the Lord.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; You those of you that read the Old
[50:24] Testament, you know that it is used
[50:26] several times in the singular form and
[50:30] in the plural form. So the singular form
[50:34] predated the existence
[50:37] of Jesus as a man on the earth. What was
[50:41] it? God's own being in the angelic
[50:46] realm. The theophonyic appearance of
[50:50] God. Now watch. The prophet said THE
[50:54] MESSENGERS, THE BODIES, THEIR BODIES,
[50:57] angelic bodies that they go into if they
[51:02] die, they're always before my father's
[51:07] face in heaven.
[51:10] But you now you realize the devil
[51:14] doesn't have one of those.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; That's right. Neither do the angels that
[51:19] fell from his presence.
[51:23] Neither do unregenerate, unredeemable
[51:28] human beings on the earth. Only the
[51:32] elected, the redeemed has angels. As a
[51:38] matter of fact,
[51:41] that's one of the reasons you are
[51:43] redeemed
[51:46] &gt;&gt; because the deposit
[51:48] of that body which spun off of the
[51:54] eternal himself
[51:57] is the heavenly deposit
[52:00] before his throne
[52:03] and it has a counterpart on the first
[52:07] which was the seed of God that come into
[52:09] you when you took the breath of life.
[52:13] Oh, you say, "No, it didn't, brother
[52:14] Donnie. I I got the seed of God when I
[52:17] got born again." As a matter of fact,
[52:19] the reason you could get born again was
[52:22] because you already had the seed of God.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; We did not become sons and daughters by
[52:29] the rebirth. We were sons of God and
[52:32] daughters of God. That's how we were
[52:36] reborn.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Now, I know there's a lot of message
[52:39] people that don't believe that, and I
[52:41] did call them what they are. They are
[52:42] message people. But if you're real bride
[52:45] people, you believe it.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; There's a difference between so-called
[52:50] message people and really bride people.
[52:53] Now notice then these angels are
[52:57] associated with you because it is your
[53:02] body, the angelic presence that you go
[53:06] into once you leave this life. Now God
[53:11] knew how many there would be. So he
[53:15] placed them on the lamb's book of life,
[53:18] not the book of life. because your name
[53:20] can be on the book of life and removed.
[53:24] But there's no way possible for one name
[53:28] to ever be blotted out in the lamb's
[53:31] book of life.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; So the lamb's book of life is associated
[53:37] with the angelic theophanes that stand
[53:41] before the throne of God. For every name
[53:44] there's a body and for every body there
[53:47] is a name. So there is a name, there is
[53:50] a body and there is a seed. Now what a
[53:54] different sphere these all are in. So
[53:57] the name is in the lamb's book of life,
[54:00] the lamb's personal diary. AND THEN THE
[54:03] BODY IS there before his holy presence
[54:06] before the throne of God. And then we
[54:09] when we come into this life and we
[54:11] receive that spoken word seed from God
[54:15] which goes into our soul and may lay
[54:17] there for decades, may lay there for
[54:19] years but then one day it becomes born
[54:22] again. Then when it does that puts you
[54:26] in direct communion to the heavenly
[54:29] sphere that your other two parts are
[54:32] already identified with. Now, I hope
[54:34] tonight this will make clear to you why
[54:37] the prophet said when you heard the word
[54:39] of God and you recognized it was eagle
[54:43] food, you left the other thing and you
[54:47] heard from your theophamy.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Now you see friends, that's why people
[54:53] can come to the message and leave the
[54:55] message and turn against the message and
[54:57] make all types of YouTube videos and
[55:00] this and that and the other. And I feel
[55:02] sorry for them, you know. I really do. I
[55:04] feel sorry for them because for a lot of
[55:06] them, they'll never get back. They'll
[55:08] never have nothing to come back to. BUT
[55:11] YOU FEEL SORRY FOR them in the sense
[55:13] that they never heard from their
[55:15] theophony when they heard the message or
[55:18] they would have never left in the first
[55:20] place. Now, they heard it because it
[55:22] made sense. Well, the serpent seed makes
[55:24] sense and and this makes sense. This
[55:27] makes sense. That that's not what a
[55:29] bride member hears. that it makes sense.
[55:32] She hears from her theophony. YOU SEE,
[55:36] AS THE PROPHET TELLS us in the natural
[55:39] resemblance of this that when a man
[55:41] meets a woman and he falls in love with
[55:44] her and he don't know why and a woman
[55:47] meets a man and she falls in love with
[55:49] him and she doesn't know why. That is an
[55:53] eternal mate that stepped out of
[55:55] eternity together into a body called
[55:58] time. and one day they'll go back to
[56:01] eternity again. Now, God mirrored those
[56:05] of us who have our eternal mate in this
[56:08] life. God mirrored the divine family in
[56:12] the human family. So, what was it that
[56:16] got a hold of us when there was people
[56:18] sitting in the same church we were and
[56:21] heard the seals preached and heard the
[56:23] message of the hour preached and for
[56:25] some of them done absolutely nothing.
[56:27] For others, it drove them into further
[56:30] darkness. Some of them heard it,
[56:31] responded for a while, and then left and
[56:34] went back to the vomit they come out of.
[56:37] Amen. And yet you, it did something
[56:40] totally different to you. So it actually
[56:44] brought you to a state of an invisible
[56:48] union with your husband, Christ Jesus.
[56:51] SO WHAT WAS IT? YOU both were eternal
[56:55] mates that stepped out of eternity. But
[56:58] you see, he stepped out of eternity as
[57:01] well and come down to be able to produce
[57:04] a chemistry, a blood that would be able
[57:07] to wash you by the waters of the bloody
[57:10] bleeding word and redeem you with the
[57:13] word of life and bring you back. Will he
[57:16] come before you? But knowing that you
[57:18] would follow him. So when you come to
[57:21] the earth, you stagger around. You go to
[57:23] this church, that church, you're lying,
[57:25] you're drunk, whatever you were. But one
[57:27] day, the light of God struck your heart.
[57:30] THEN WHAT HAPPENED? You well, you know
[57:32] what? You met your mate, Christ, the
[57:36] word. NOW YOU SEE OTHER PEOPLE, THEY
[57:40] THEY heard a tape. They thought that was
[57:42] a good sermon. They read a good book,
[57:44] but they never met their mate. It's not
[57:47] like that it joined up something with
[57:50] them from their soul. They were happy
[57:52] for a while, but alas, they got to
[57:55] looking for another husband. And that's
[57:58] what they found. Why? Because the first
[57:59] one was not dead. But for those of you
[58:02] that have found that the anointed word
[58:05] Christ is the Messiah, your hunt for the
[58:08] Messiah is over.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Friends, this is why a lot of the
[58:13] message folks are still hunting for a
[58:14] Messiah. I'm telling you tonight, the
[58:16] search is still on in this message.
[58:19] That's why some people will rally around
[58:21] this man and that man or this woman and
[58:23] that woman or this church and that move.
[58:26] You know why? They're still searching
[58:28] for a Messiah. But if you have found
[58:31] that Christ the Word is your anointed
[58:34] Messiah, your husband, then your search
[58:38] for the Messiah is over. You're not
[58:41] looking for another Messiah. Thank God
[58:44] you found him and y'all got married.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Now would you notice how Paul deals with
[58:51] this as well that we are associated with
[58:54] these angelic beings with the redeemed
[58:57] in heaven. Watch him in Hebrews 12:22.
[59:01] BUT YE are come unto Mount Sion. Now
[59:05] notice in the Old Testament, of course,
[59:07] a few places in the New. used with the
[59:09] letter Z, but here it's used with the
[59:12] letter S, which is Greek. So you are
[59:14] come unto Mount Sion and unto the city
[59:20] of the living God already. ALREADY
[59:23] ALREADY, NOT YOU'RE GOING TO, but
[59:26] already you have come unto the Mount
[59:29] Zion. SO WHAT IS THE MOUNT ZION? The
[59:32] church of the living God. Now notice he
[59:36] goes on to say and unto the city of the
[59:39] LIVING GOD. WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT CITY?
[59:42] WHAT what is the city? JESUS SAID YE are
[59:45] a city set on a hill. Praise the Lord.
[59:49] So here Paul is bringing the further
[59:52] identification
[59:54] to the new Jerusalem. Of course will be
[59:57] a literal one but here it is a spiritual
[1:00:00] one. You're common to Mount Zion, unto
[1:00:03] the city of the living God, the heavenly
[1:00:07] Jerusalem, and to an innumerable
[1:00:11] company OF ANGELS. NOW, PAUL SAID, "For
[1:00:14] those that have already been born again,
[1:00:16] you have already arrived to this state."
[1:00:21] Oh my. Anybody believe that tonight?
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; So, look what you've COME TO. BUT YE ARE
[1:00:26] COME, not coming. Ye are come unto Mount
[1:00:31] Zion, unto the city of the living God,
[1:00:34] the heavenly Jerusalem, to an
[1:00:36] innumerable company of angels. Oh, if
[1:00:40] the highest INTELLIGENCE OF the angelic
[1:00:44] realm purge, oh, they they look down and
[1:00:47] they peer into the supernatural ELEMENT
[1:00:51] OF GOD dealing with man on the earth.
[1:00:54] And they see through what God is dealing
[1:00:57] with his human beings, a display of the
[1:01:00] wisdom OF GOD THAT THEY DO NOT SEE in
[1:01:04] the stellular heavens. NOW, THEY LOOK AT
[1:01:06] the moon and they look at the all the
[1:01:09] great stars and all the awesome things
[1:01:11] that God did out there, but they don't
[1:01:13] see the blood. They don't see the cross.
[1:01:16] THEY DON'T SEE MANY THINGS THERE. It's
[1:01:18] hid, of course, in symbols, BUT THEY
[1:01:20] DON'T SEE IT. SO, GOD DID NOT PUT IT
[1:01:22] THERE AS A BOOK BY WHICH he could teach
[1:01:25] the angels from, but he places us on
[1:01:28] earth and said, "Now watch me as I deal
[1:01:31] with them, and you will learn great
[1:01:34] things.
[1:01:35] So if them looking at it brings such
[1:01:39] profound reverence that they stoop down
[1:01:43] as I've shared with you several times
[1:01:45] already and the word that Peter used is
[1:01:48] they look into which means to stoop down
[1:01:51] with earnest gaze to look into and they
[1:01:55] peer into that realm of what God is
[1:01:58] dealing AND IT PRODUCES SUCH AN AWE AND
[1:02:02] SUCH a reverence to the angels. angels,
[1:02:05] what ought it to do to us
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; now? They will never even experience
[1:02:12] redemption BECAUSE IT'S NOT FOR THEM.
[1:02:15] THEY WILL NEVER experience salvation.
[1:02:18] Not one angel will ever get the baptism
[1:02:21] of the Holy Ghost. Not one angel will
[1:02:23] ever take on the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:26] and water baptism. Not one angel will
[1:02:29] ever be able to sit in the HEAVENLY
[1:02:32] PLACES IN CHRIST Jesus where we sat.
[1:02:37] THEY TRULY ARE IN HEAVENLY PLACES, BUT
[1:02:39] NOT WHERE WE ARE. IT IS OUR SOUL. It is
[1:02:43] a different sphere than where the angels
[1:02:46] of God have lived and walked for eons of
[1:02:49] ages of time. NOW, WATCH THIS. THE
[1:02:52] PROPHET GOES, I I love the way describes
[1:02:54] this. MAY THE ANGELS OF GOD COME DOWN
[1:02:58] into this city and the cities AROUND
[1:03:03] ABOUT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY visit homes
[1:03:09] stir people.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Now I want YOU TO NOTICE WHEN WE HAVE a
[1:03:14] messenger that God raises up in the last
[1:03:17] day AND HIS COMMISSION WAS NOT GIVEN to
[1:03:20] him by Baptist church. IT WAS NOT GIVEN
[1:03:23] BY A BUNCH OF local elders that
[1:03:26] recognize a gift in this man's life, but
[1:03:28] his commission was given to him by
[1:03:31] angels. Now, how strange that it was for
[1:03:34] those of you that listen to tapes, AND
[1:03:36] YOU'LL NOTICE, BROTHER BRANDHAM, early
[1:03:38] on in the 40s, he goes to talking about
[1:03:42] angels and the angelic visitation. NOW,
[1:03:45] IT MUST HAVE BEEN VERY strange to the
[1:03:48] Pentecostals. Uh there was some of them
[1:03:50] of course that claimed angelic
[1:03:52] visitation. No doubt they may have had
[1:03:54] it. But brother Brandham had to actually
[1:03:58] put out really what we would call a
[1:04:00] disclaimer because he talked about the
[1:04:03] angel of God so much and he would talk
[1:04:06] about how he appeared to him and he
[1:04:09] showed him this and he showed him that
[1:04:11] and he even even said now in case you're
[1:04:15] wondering I don't worship that angel. IT
[1:04:18] MUST HAVE seemed unusual that a man
[1:04:21] would talk so much about a realm that
[1:04:25] the most of the church people understood
[1:04:28] so very little about.
[1:04:31] SO MYSELF, I'M GOING TO take the word of
[1:04:35] a man that dealt in the angelic realm
[1:04:38] more than I would those who don't.
[1:04:44] Oh, you mean YOU'RE GOING TO BASE THAT
[1:04:46] JUST UPON WHAT HE SAID ABOUT IT? YEP.
[1:04:49] Sure am.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Whenever you get the credentials he had,
[1:04:53] then come and see me and I'll replace
[1:04:56] his quotes with yours.
[1:04:59] But until you do, I'm going to keep on
[1:05:01] preaching what I'm preaching.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the church said,
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; "Is that the WAY YOU FEEL TONIGHT? I
[1:05:09] REALLY DON'T care what the person has
[1:05:11] this opinion, THAT OPINION. I KNOW THE
[1:05:13] critics like to listen to me and they
[1:05:15] like to find fault and do this and that
[1:05:17] and the other and oh they about blow a
[1:05:19] valve every time that I READ QUOTES.
[1:05:21] WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? THERE'S A FIX for
[1:05:23] that. You spies. If you spies don't want
[1:05:26] to hear me read QUOTES FROM THE PROPHET,
[1:05:29] DON'T STREAM OUR SERVICES.
[1:05:32] That's an easy fix
[1:05:34] because AS LONG AS I'M IN MY RIGHT MIND,
[1:05:37] I'M GOING TO QUOTE MALACHI 4. BECAUSE IF
[1:05:40] ID HAVE LIVED IN THE DAYS OF PAUL, I'D
[1:05:43] HAVE QUOTED PAUL. IF ID LIVED IN THE
[1:05:45] DAYS OF NOAH, I'D HAVE QUOTED NOAH. IF
[1:05:48] I'D HAVE LIVED IN ALL THE REST THEM
[1:05:50] TIMES, I'D HAVE QUOTED them men because
[1:05:52] the WORD OF GOD COMES to his prophets.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Now notice, MAY THE ANGELS OF GOD COME
[1:06:00] DOWN INTO this city and the cities round
[1:06:04] about THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. Visit
[1:06:07] homes stir people. I want YOU TO NOTICE
[1:06:10] HOW THAT he identifies what what happens
[1:06:15] when the angels come and certain things
[1:06:18] that he would pray that WOULD BRING THE
[1:06:22] ANGELIC PRESENCE. Now then it makes me
[1:06:24] wonder as I've looked at this in the
[1:06:26] last oh I don't know several weeks
[1:06:28] however long it's been if you and I as
[1:06:30] the people of God should not begin to
[1:06:33] pray in the same manner and ask for the
[1:06:37] same thing.
[1:06:39] NOTICE AGAIN IT SAYS THE ANGELS OF GOD
[1:06:42] ARE standing in the AISLES TONIGHT.
[1:06:45] THERE THEY ARE AND THE GREAT HOLY SPIRIT
[1:06:49] moving up and down the aisles. I FIND IT
[1:06:53] amazing they weren't seated in the
[1:06:56] seats.
[1:06:58] YOU KNOW WHY they can't take your place?
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; The seats belong to you.
[1:07:06] AND YOU KNOW WHERE THEIR PLACE IS? IN
[1:07:09] THE AISLES.
[1:07:11] Lord have mercy, CHILDREN.
[1:07:14] A PLACE THAT ANGELS OF GOD DON'T EVEN
[1:07:18] COME IN AND SIT DOWN BECAUSE OF
[1:07:21] REVERENCE AND BECAUSE OF THEIR POST OF
[1:07:25] DUTY TO STAND IN THE AISLES. AND GOD
[1:07:28] COMMISSS THE angels to stand in the
[1:07:31] aisles in the front and in the back. And
[1:07:35] God gives you a seat.
[1:07:39] And the angels are your custodians.
[1:07:44] THE ANGELS [screaming] ARE YOUR USHERS.
[1:07:48] Lord Jesus.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; THE ANGELS OF GOD ARE STANDING IN THE
[1:07:54] AISLES TONIGHT. OH MY. Notice again in
[1:07:57] the law having a shadow. He said God
[1:07:59] lets his angels have watch over us. THE
[1:08:02] ANGELS OF GOD ARE ENCAMPED ABOUT. THEY
[1:08:05] DON'T GO BACK AND FORTH. They stay here.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; I LIKE THAT. THE ANGELS OF GOD ARE
[1:08:14] ENCAMPED ABOUT those that fear him.
[1:08:16] Don't you understand, friends? He They
[1:08:19] may not let us see them. HE MAY NOT EVEN
[1:08:22] LET US SENSE THEM ALL THE TIME, but they
[1:08:25] are here. Oh, I'll tell you one thing.
[1:08:27] If we could grab a hold of that tonight,
[1:08:29] I don't care what the devil would throw
[1:08:31] before us, we'd look at things a lot
[1:08:33] different. I BELIEVE I BELIEVE A LOT OF
[1:08:35] THIS UNNECESSARY FEAR THAT WE ALLOW IN
[1:08:38] OUR LIVES by all kinds OF DIFFERENT
[1:08:40] THINGS. OH, WE WORRY ABOUT THIS
[1:08:42] POLITICIAN, that politician. We worry
[1:08:44] about this and that AND THE OTHER. I'LL
[1:08:45] tell you one thing. If we could
[1:08:46] understand the angels of God RIGHT HERE
[1:08:48] TONIGHT, I TOLD THE DEVIL TODAY, I just
[1:08:51] having a big debate with him and I told
[1:08:52] him to shut his mouth, not open his
[1:08:54] mouth till I say that he could. I TOLD
[1:08:56] HIM HE DIDN'T HAVE no control OF MY
[1:08:58] LIFE. HE didn't bring me on the earth.
[1:09:00] He has nothing to do with me leaving the
[1:09:02] earth. I'M ORDAINED OF GOD TO MASH HIS
[1:09:04] MOUTH TO TRUMP HIM DOWN IN THE DUST. I
[1:09:07] TOLD HIM THE church of the living God's
[1:09:09] GOING TO STAND ON THE LAST DAY. And
[1:09:10] there wasn't one thing he COULD DO ABOUT
[1:09:12] IT. OH, Y'ALL HEARD HIM WHINING BACK
[1:09:14] DOWN INTO HELL LIKE A LITTLE PUPPY DOG
[1:09:17] WITH HIS tail shot BETWEEN HIS LEGS. YOU
[1:09:19] KNOW WHY? YOU AND I, SONS AND DAUGHTERS
[1:09:22] OF GOD, WE LIVE SO FAR BENEATH OUR
[1:09:24] PRIVILEGE AS A PEOPLE OF GOD. I DON'T
[1:09:27] THINK WE NEED TO ARGUE SO MUCH WITH THE
[1:09:29] DEVIL. BUT WE NEED TO PUT HIM IN HIS
[1:09:31] PLACE AND NOT ALLOW HIM TO OPEN HIS
[1:09:32] MOUTH AND SAY, "DON'T YOU GO TO TALKING
[1:09:35] BACK TO ME. SHUT UP, DEVIL, AND GET ON
[1:09:37] BACK DOWN TO HELL. I AIN'T GOT TIME TO
[1:09:39] FOOL WITH YOU TODAY. I'VE GOT TO SEE IF
[1:09:41] I CAN LET MY LIGHT SHINE. I GOT TO SEE
[1:09:44] IF I CAN TELL SOMEBODY ABOUT JESUS."
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:51] NOTICE THIS. IN THIS BUILDING HERE are
[1:09:55] evil spirits
[1:09:57] and war
[1:10:00] and Christians
[1:10:02] anointed
[1:10:03] AND THE ANGELS OF GOD ENCAMPED ABOUT
[1:10:08] THEM
[1:10:09] trying to interize
[1:10:15] ENERGIZE THEM. [clears throat] NOTICE,
[1:10:18] NOT WITH FEAR, NOT WITH ANXIETY, NOT
[1:10:22] WITH SADNESS, NOT WITH SORROW. ENERGIZE
[1:10:26] them with faith.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; BROTHER DONNIE, I THOUGHT FAITH COME BY
[1:10:29] HEARING AND HEARING BY THE WORD. SURE IT
[1:10:31] DOES. BUT FAITH ALSO SOMETIMES needs an
[1:10:34] energy,
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; an angelic energy.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, how many's ever been there? Well,
[1:10:39] yeah, Lord, I know it's a true God. I
[1:10:41] know your word is true. YOU CAN'T LIE,
[1:10:42] LORD. AND WE'RE SAYING IT OVER AND over
[1:10:44] and over again. And then all of A
[1:10:45] SUDDEN, SOMETHING COMES from somewhere
[1:10:47] and you just feel an energy that comes
[1:10:49] in there. WHAT WAS IT? Your angel was
[1:10:52] STANDING THERE BY YOU AND God just let
[1:10:53] him zap you with it.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. LET THEM ENERGIZE them with
[1:10:58] faith. I thought that was an awesome
[1:11:00] example that brother Matt used on Sunday
[1:11:03] about being shot by electricity. How
[1:11:05] many's ever been shot by electricity?
[1:11:07] Oh, it'll it'll light you up ON IT. OH
[1:11:10] MY. IT'LL LIGHT YOU UP. WELL, WHAT ABOUT
[1:11:12] THE SPIRIT OF GOD? THE DEVIL, MY HE
[1:11:15] KNOWS ENOUGH about this word to know. He
[1:11:18] can tell whenever we're just quoting the
[1:11:19] logos, the logos, THE LOGOS, AND WE'RE
[1:11:22] GETTING DISCOURAGED ABOUT IT. But Lord
[1:11:24] have mercy, WHEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD GOES
[1:11:26] TO ENERGIZING THAT WORD AND TAKES THAT
[1:11:29] LOGOS AND MAKES IT a rama word for you.
[1:11:33] A RAINBOW WORD IS THAT LOGOS
[1:11:36] TRANSFORMED, ENERGIZED, and becomes a
[1:11:40] living word for whatever you have need
[1:11:42] of for the hour that you're in.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Oh my. NOTICE THIS. WHAT A GREAT THING
[1:11:48] that it is TO KNOW THAT TONIGHT, RIGHT
[1:11:51] IN THIS BUILDING, there is angels
[1:11:54] [screaming] of God standing.
[1:11:57] [clears throat]
[1:11:57] Oh my goodness. So, you mean they don't
[1:11:59] come to church and snooze? They don't
[1:12:02] come to church and text. They don't come
[1:12:05] to church and write notes. And they
[1:12:07] don't come to church and say, "Wonder
[1:12:08] how many pages brother Donny's got on
[1:12:10] his iPad. Reckon how much longer we got?
[1:12:13] The kids have got to get up early in the
[1:12:15] morning. OH MY, THIS THEY'RE AT
[1:12:17] ATTENTION.
[1:12:19] YOU IMAGINE STANDING RIGHT IN THIS PLACE
[1:12:21] TONIGHT. THE ANGELS OF GOD AREN'T
[1:12:23] RELAXED. THEY'RE NOT SITTING BACK KICK
[1:12:26] BACK IN IN ANGELIC RECLINERS. THEY'RE
[1:12:29] STANDING AT ATTENTION. They're looking
[1:12:30] ALL OVER THE BUILDING. THEY'RE LOOKING
[1:12:32] BACK AND FORTH. WHY? THEY KNOW THERE'S
[1:12:34] DEMONS HERE. THEY KNOW THERE'S A WARFARE
[1:12:37] GOING ON. THEY ARE WATCHING YOU. THEY'RE
[1:12:40] WATCHING ME. OH, HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; They know every word
[1:12:47] that we say and [clears throat]
[1:12:49] everything
[1:12:51] that we do.
[1:12:55] An angel came to a home. Zachcharias and
[1:13:00] Elizabeth.
[1:13:01] They were great renown
[1:13:05] believers.
[1:13:08] That don't mean everybody in the world
[1:13:09] knew about them. Being great and
[1:13:12] renowned in the eyes of God don't mean
[1:13:14] anybody here on the earth already even
[1:13:16] knows who you are.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. I'd rather be
[1:13:20] renowned in heaven than I would on the
[1:13:22] earth any day. Wouldn't you? THEY WERE
[1:13:24] GREAT RENOWNED BELIEVERS, Christians as
[1:13:27] to call. AND THAT'S THE kind of a home
[1:13:31] that an angel can get to.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK TODAY? THE REASON
[1:13:37] WE DON'T HAVE NO MORE angelic
[1:13:39] visitations than we do,
[1:13:41] we who call ourselves Christians,
[1:13:45] PLAY CARDS HALF THE NIGHT,
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; READ OLD TRUE STORY MAGAZINES have beer
[1:13:52] in the ICE BOX.
[1:13:54] THAT'S the reason angels don't visit us.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; You can't mix oil and water.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, saints. AMEN.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; NOW, THESE ANGELS came into these homes
[1:14:09] when they were renowned
[1:14:13] homes.
[1:14:15] May God grant that Word of Life Church
[1:14:18] will be filled
[1:14:20] with renowned homes.
[1:14:24] Why renowned people living there?
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; They go to a renowned church.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; They're going to a renowned city. They
[1:14:33] serve a renowned God. They believe a
[1:14:36] renowned message. Come on, somebody.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S OUR IDENTITY.
[1:14:42] NOTICE AGAIN, HE SAYS, "AND THE ANGELS
[1:14:45] ARE WATCHING OVER US DAY and night. They
[1:14:48] never leave. They're encamped about and
[1:14:51] we can expect God
[1:14:54] to do most anything at any time
[1:14:59] because
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; of the presence of the angels of God who
[1:15:05] ARE COMMISSIONED BY him to watch
[1:15:10] and care
[1:15:12] for us.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:17] How would you like to know that you had
[1:15:21] angelic daycare?
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Take care of the children.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; GOD ATTACHES THESE GREAT RENOWNED BEINGS
[1:15:39] TO WATCH OVER and careful. SO, BROTHER
[1:15:43] D, IF THAT'S SO, THEN WHY DO BAD THINGS
[1:15:45] COME OUR WAY? YOU THINK IT'S BAD. What
[1:15:48] would it be if they WASN'T THERE?
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; OH, YOU I'VE WENT THROUGH TRIALS. I'VE
[1:15:52] WENT THROUGH THIS. YEAH, SO HAVE I. BUT
[1:15:54] I'M SURE GLAD THEM ANGELS HAVE BEEN
[1:15:56] THERE TO HELP ME. I'D PROBABLY BEEN
[1:15:57] WACKY AS A LUNATIC if it I'd be like a
[1:16:00] wrestle to see out OF MY MIND. THEY
[1:16:02] DON'T KEEP US FROM HARD THINGS. THEY
[1:16:05] DON'T KEEP US FROM GOING THROUGH TRIAL,
[1:16:08] BUT THEY GIVE US SUSTAINING STRENGTH.
[1:16:10] THEY'RE THERE TO ENERGIZE US. AND WHEN
[1:16:13] PAPA WILL SAY NO AND BREAK OUR HEARTS
[1:16:16] YET THEY ARE [screaming] THERE TO
[1:16:19] MINISTER TO US LIKE THE FATHER. OH
[1:16:22] HALLELUJAH. THE SPIRIT GOD WHEN HE
[1:16:24] REFUSED TO TAKE THE BURDEN AWAY FROM THE
[1:16:27] LORD JESUS DYING ON THE CROSS AND HE
[1:16:30] SAID FATHER NOT MY WILL BUT THY WILL BE
[1:16:32] DONE AND THE ANGELS OF GOD COME AND
[1:16:35] MINISTER TO HIM WHENEVER HE HEARD THE
[1:16:38] father say no.
[1:16:41] Sure.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; You're the only one
[1:16:45] that can do this. But Jesus, as a man,
[1:16:47] said, "I don't want to die.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; I don't want to die.
[1:16:55] I don't want to hang up there naked.
[1:16:58] I don't want my back to be beat. I don't
[1:17:00] want them to spit my faces or any other
[1:17:02] way."
[1:17:05] And when he accepted the know of God,
[1:17:09] God sent angels down in the garden of
[1:17:11] Gethsemane
[1:17:13] to minister to him and help him.
[1:17:17] It's going to be all right.
[1:17:20] It's going to be all right.
[1:17:24] AND WE CAN EXPECT GOD TO DO MOST
[1:17:26] anything
[1:17:28] at any [screaming] time. Look, children,
[1:17:31] you don't have to just BE A CHURCH.
[1:17:33] YOU'RE AT HOME AND ALL HELL COMES
[1:17:35] AGAINST YOU. YOUR ANGEL LIVES WITH YOU.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT LIVING GUESTS.
[1:17:42] COME ON, SOMEBODY.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. [screaming] YOU'VE GOT
[1:17:46] LIVING GUESTS. NOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
[1:17:47] WORRY ABOUT THEM. THEY DON'T SLEEP IN
[1:17:48] BEDS. THEY'LL NEVER BE in your chairs.
[1:17:50] THEY'LL NEVER TAKE YOUR FAVORITE CHAIR.
[1:17:52] BROTHER ROB, SISTER SARAH, NEVER HAVE TO
[1:17:54] FIX UP FOR THEM, BUT THEY'RE ALWAYS
[1:17:56] THERE. [screaming]
[1:17:57] IF WE'VE GOT RENOWNED HOMES, THE ANGELS
[1:18:00] OF GOD ARE THERE AMONG US. OH, I
[1:18:02] [screaming] WONDER HOW MUCH THEY'VE KEPT
[1:18:04] FROM US. I WONDER HOW MUCH THEY'VE
[1:18:06] HELPED US THROUGH THINGS. AND WE
[1:18:08] WONDERED, OH GOD, AND WE WENT TO BED ONE
[1:18:10] NIGHT SO WEARY AND SO WORN AND WOKE UP
[1:18:12] THE NEXT MORNING LIKE IT WAS A DIFFERENT
[1:18:14] WORLD. IT AIN'T NO WONDER. ANGELS ARE
[1:18:17] SENT DOWN AT NIGHT AND THEY PROBABLY
[1:18:19] TOOK THEIR HAND AND RUBBED YOUR BROW and
[1:18:22] you were SO WEARY AND SO WORN AND
[1:18:24] SOMEHOW THE NEXT MORNING WHEN YOU GOT
[1:18:26] UP, how you feeling today, honey? I'm
[1:18:30] feeling better.
[1:18:32] Praise the Lord. I'm feeling better
[1:18:34] today. WELL, YOU READY TO TAKE ON THAT
[1:18:36] DEVIL? HO HO. NOW, I DIDN'T SAY I'M
[1:18:38] FEELING THAT THAT MUCH BETTER, BUT I'M
[1:18:40] FEELING BETTER. WHAT WAS IT? THE ANGEL
[1:18:42] JUST KIND OF STROKED YOUR BROW ALL
[1:18:44] NIGHT. IF YOU'D BE ABLE TO LOOK INTO
[1:18:46] YOUR ROOM AND SEE THEM THERE AND THEY'RE
[1:18:48] looking at you, Father, be mindful of
[1:18:51] them. Be mindful of them.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Can I give them some of my strength?
[1:18:57] Can I be able to to give them a little
[1:18:59] something? Father, this is really hard
[1:19:01] on him. Can I help him? Go ahead.
[1:19:06] And you finally go to sleep and image
[1:19:08] over.
[1:19:10] Oh, you don't know how much you're
[1:19:12] loved.
[1:19:14] Just rest.
[1:19:16] Rest there, little daughter of God.
[1:19:19] He loves you so much.
[1:19:23] Oh,
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus.
[1:19:29] BECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE OF THE ANGELS OF
[1:19:31] GOD WHO ARE COMMISSIONED.
[1:19:36] Brother Brandon wasn't the only one
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; that was given an angel with commission.
[1:19:44] God ordains his angels or let me say it
[1:19:47] this way, your angels.
[1:19:51] They are commissioned from Almighty God
[1:19:55] to come down and minister
[1:19:58] to you.
[1:20:04] Commissioned by him to watch
[1:20:07] and care for us.
[1:20:11] THOU FATHER, WE PRAY THAT THE ANGELS OF
[1:20:14] God
[1:20:16] will take their place tonight by the
[1:20:21] side
[1:20:23] of each believer.
[1:20:27] Their position
[1:20:30] is by your side. Think of it. WE WHO
[1:20:34] WERE LOST,
[1:20:36] WE WHO WERE WITHOUT THE COMMONWEALTH OF
[1:20:39] ISRAEL.
[1:20:41] And yet God so redeemed us that he
[1:20:45] commissions personal angels
[1:20:48] by each one of his children who says
[1:20:51] this is your post of duty for the rest
[1:20:56] of their life.
[1:20:58] Never leave them.
[1:21:01] NEVER LIFT THEM OUT OF YOUR SIGHT.
[1:21:06] Even in hard times, even in difficult
[1:21:09] times.
[1:21:14] Seldom of the ever fine one. Talking
[1:21:16] about people say THEY'RE CHRISTIANS.
[1:21:19] THAT'LL LAY DOWN HIS LIFE FOR THE CAUSE
[1:21:21] OF CHRIST.
[1:21:23] HE WON'T EVEN CRAWL OUT OF HIS SHADE
[1:21:25] TREE TO go to church.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Wow. This prophet believe in going to
[1:21:31] church. Huh?
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; I don't understand them. And I press
[1:21:35] play on this and I hear him say go to
[1:21:37] church and other people press play and
[1:21:39] they don't believe you have to go to
[1:21:40] church.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; I'm glad my version says this.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; WON'T EVEN GET OUT FROM BEHIND THE
[1:21:50] television
[1:21:51] long enough TO ATTEND A WEDNESDAY NIGHT
[1:21:54] PRAYER MEETING.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN. [screaming]
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YES, SIR.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; That's right. AMEN. IT'S A SHAME.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; DISGRACE.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Word of life said,
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; "That's the reason angels don't visit
[1:22:13] the churches." You understand? Angels
[1:22:16] don't visit every church.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; And if we want to keep the angels of God
[1:22:23] away from our church,
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; these are the things that'll do it.
[1:22:30] We disrespect his house. We don't
[1:22:33] reverence his presence.
[1:22:37] Oh my.
[1:22:39] We've got to get down to deep
[1:22:43] sincerity
[1:22:45] of this thing.
[1:22:47] THE ANGELS OF GOD ARE HERE ON EARTH
[1:22:50] tonight
[1:22:52] just the same as they've always been.
[1:22:58] Now, I wonder
[1:23:00] how many people here tonight,
[1:23:04] who have the Holy Ghost,
[1:23:11] who have spoken in tongues
[1:23:14] of angels.
[1:23:19] Now you see there's languages
[1:23:22] that we can speak in tongues with
[1:23:26] which are to be interpreted.
[1:23:29] But then there's also an angelic tongue
[1:23:32] or tongues
[1:23:34] which are not to be interpreted.
[1:23:39] But in the time of need
[1:23:42] for someone,
[1:23:46] an angel can come near
[1:23:50] and begin TO ANOINT A HUMAN being
[1:23:55] in that realm and they begin to speak in
[1:23:58] a tongue that they do not know or
[1:24:01] understand.
[1:24:04] And it's actually
[1:24:07] THE ANGEL
[1:24:09] HELPING them to speak a message to
[1:24:13] heaven,
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; not using their own tongue,
[1:24:18] but angelic tongues.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Boy, y'all are listening to me tonight,
[1:24:22] ain't you? That's good. I don't see
[1:24:24] nobody sleeping tonight. PRAISE THE
[1:24:26] LORD.
[1:24:27] NOW WATCH 1 Corinthians CHAPTER 13:1.
[1:24:30] THOUGH I SPEAK WITH TONGUES OF men
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; and of angels.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; SO YOU MEAN PAUL
[1:24:43] had spoke in angelic tongues?
[1:24:47] Wow.
[1:24:49] And he said, "Have no charity. I become
[1:24:51] as a sounding brass or a tinkling
[1:24:54] symbol." Now watch question answer 61.
[1:24:56] AND THE PROPHET SAID PAUL over here also
[1:24:58] in the Corinthians where you're asking
[1:25:00] here and he said THERE ARE TONGUES OF
[1:25:02] angels and there are tongues of men. Now
[1:25:05] tongues of angels IS WHEN A MAN'S
[1:25:08] PRAYING TO him
[1:25:11] to him and God alone.
[1:25:16] But when he's speaking a language
[1:25:20] it's to be interpreted in the church for
[1:25:24] edification.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; of the church.
[1:25:30] Now there's lots of times in our
[1:25:32] services
[1:25:34] I see as it's moving
[1:25:37] [snorts]
[1:25:39] and I WATCH THE SPIRIT OF GOD AS IT
[1:25:41] MOVES AND I SEE SOME of you
[1:25:44] you start talking in tongues
[1:25:49] BUT IT'S NOT necessarily a language
[1:25:52] tongue
[1:25:53] which is to be interpreted for the
[1:25:56] benefit of the church.
[1:25:59] Then that's why we're to hold our peace
[1:26:02] as far as in a public way. Right now, a
[1:26:06] person worshiping, standing there
[1:26:07] worshiping, praising God, not
[1:26:09] interrupting anybody. Now, watch the
[1:26:12] prophet give us an example of this.
[1:26:15] THERE'S TWO different tongues. Tongues
[1:26:17] of angels. That's a man in private
[1:26:20] prayer OUT YONDER somewhere
[1:26:26] speaking to God.
[1:26:30] Now, for those of you that have had this
[1:26:32] experience,
[1:26:34] you know,
[1:26:37] it it is it is it's something. That's
[1:26:41] just all I know to say. It it is
[1:26:43] something
[1:26:45] OUT YONDER somewhere
[1:26:49] speaking to God. SPEAKING TO GOD
[1:26:54] in angelic
[1:26:56] tongues.
[1:27:01] So then the spirit of God would move in
[1:27:03] our assembly
[1:27:06] [clears throat] for gifted people
[1:27:10] and then someone would speak in tongues
[1:27:13] and someone that would have the gift of
[1:27:16] interpretation.
[1:27:18] We know the way the prophet taught that
[1:27:19] it should be done.
[1:27:22] If they are speaking in a language, say
[1:27:25] they would be speaking in Aramaic or
[1:27:28] Greek or Hebrew or Spanish or you know
[1:27:32] could be all kinds of different
[1:27:34] languages. If it's to be interpreted, it
[1:27:37] will be a language which can be
[1:27:40] interpreted.
[1:27:43] And if there's no interpreter, they're
[1:27:45] to hold their peace,
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; But now a person gets into a spot,
[1:27:53] maybe they're driving down the road,
[1:27:55] maybe they're in prayer, maybe they're
[1:27:56] right here in church,
[1:27:58] AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVES ON THEM, AND
[1:28:00] IT'S LIKE THEY they feel like they're
[1:28:03] fixing to leave this place,
[1:28:07] and they break out into this language,
[1:28:10] and it's just them and God. They're not
[1:28:12] they're not there. They're not hindering
[1:28:14] anyone else. They're not making a a big
[1:28:16] thing and interrupting the service
[1:28:21] and yet they don't know one clue
[1:28:25] what they're saying.
[1:28:28] And they are talking and saying all
[1:28:30] kinds of words and they don't even know
[1:28:33] what it means.
[1:28:40] Well, you see, there's times that
[1:28:43] the angels
[1:28:46] might need to borrow human voices
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; CUZ THERE MIGHT BE SOMEBODY IN REAL need
[1:29:03] and a prayer of a son of God or a
[1:29:05] daughter of God would go a million miles
[1:29:08] beyond the prayer of an angel.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; But the angel can come near
[1:29:18] and so anoint that person.
[1:29:23] [panting]
[1:29:30] That's a man in private prayer yonder
[1:29:32] speaking somewhere speaking to God.
[1:29:36] speaking to God in angelic tongues.
[1:29:39] I could just call you a case right now,
[1:29:41] but haven't got time. I'm glad he went
[1:29:44] ahead and took time after saying that.
[1:29:46] You remember when the WOMAN COME TO THE
[1:29:48] AUDITORIUM THERE AND where Dr. Alexander
[1:29:51] Dow is from and Zion remember down there
[1:29:54] and Billy come down after me to get me
[1:29:56] to go to the meeting. I said, "Billy, go
[1:29:57] on back." He said, "What are you crying
[1:29:58] about?" said somebody been here. I said,
[1:30:00] "No, SIR. GO ON BACK. TELL BROTHER
[1:30:02] BAXTER TO PREACH TONIGHT."
[1:30:04] I GOT DOWN ON the floor and I said,
[1:30:06] "Lord, what's the matter with me?" ALL
[1:30:10] OF A SUDDEN, I HEARD SOMEBODY AT THE
[1:30:12] door
[1:30:15] speaking in other languages. I thought
[1:30:19] it was German.
[1:30:22] And I thought, well, that fell's come up
[1:30:24] to get him. I stopped, you know, praying
[1:30:27] and I listened at him. I want you to
[1:30:29] listen now how he describes this.
[1:30:32] So he hears what he thinks is someone
[1:30:35] speaking in a foreign language and he
[1:30:39] stops praying to listen to the
[1:30:43] individual.
[1:30:45] And I listened at him.
[1:30:48] Oh children,
[1:30:57] I listen at him
[1:31:00] who
[1:31:12] I listened at him standing there like
[1:31:14] this and I thought, now notice these
[1:31:17] WORDS ARE COMING OUT OF HIS MOUTH.
[1:31:21] BUT HE'S THINKING SOMETHING DIFFERENT
[1:31:23] THAN THESE WORDS.
[1:31:28] How is that even possible?
[1:31:34] And I thought, well, how that guy will
[1:31:37] ever understand that? Cuz I I know the
[1:31:39] man that run that motel. I was about 5
[1:31:41] milesi out of the city, you know, and I
[1:31:42] had to go out there so many people
[1:31:44] around small town. And I thought, well,
[1:31:46] that's strange. Well, boy, did you ever
[1:31:48] hear, "WELL, THAT GUY DON'T EVEN GET HIS
[1:31:50] BREATH HARDLY."
[1:31:52] Now he's thinking this the whole time.
[1:31:56] But [screaming] he's that guy.
[1:32:06] But there's another being there with
[1:32:08] him.
[1:32:11] There's another being in the room.
[1:32:22] Well, that's strange.
[1:32:24] Well, boy, DID YOU EVER HEAR THAT GUY
[1:32:26] DON'T EVEN GET HIS BREATH?
[1:32:30] He don't EVEN GET HIS BREATH. HARDLY.
[1:32:33] SEE, I was thinking that
[1:32:36] as hard as he was speaking.
[1:32:40] Listen at him. IT'S LIKE HE'S TALKING
[1:32:42] ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE.
[1:32:44] WHY?
[1:32:46] Cuz it was.
[1:32:51] There's someone else in your in this
[1:32:54] room.
[1:32:57] Oh,
[1:33:03] I just kept real still.
[1:33:07] He He didn't say any. I just kept real
[1:33:10] still. And after he got through
[1:33:13] speaking,
[1:33:15] he got through speaking.
[1:33:19] [laughter]
[1:33:24] And when it did,
[1:33:27] IT FELT LIKE I COULD RUN THROUGH A TROOP
[1:33:32] AND LEAP [screaming] OVER A WALL.
[1:33:36] when he got through speaking
[1:33:44] and I went out and Billy was going out
[1:33:46] the gate and I hollered at him, "Wait a
[1:33:47] minute." [snorts]
[1:33:50] He come back and he'd been drinking a
[1:33:53] soda pop.
[1:33:56] And he said, "Daddy, what's the matter?"
[1:34:00] I SAID, "WAIT JUST A MINUTE. JUST A
[1:34:02] MINUTE. I'M GOING WITH YOU."
[1:34:04] I STARTED WASHING MY face [laughter]
[1:34:08] real quick. He said, "WHAT'S THE
[1:34:10] MATTER?" HE KNOWS BETTER THAN TO TALK TO
[1:34:12] ME GOING to the meeting. HE SAID,
[1:34:13] "WHAT'S THE MATTER?" I SAID, "NOTHING.
[1:34:14] NOTHING. NOTHING.
[1:34:16] NOT AT ALL. JUST GO AHEAD TO THE
[1:34:19] MEETING." WE WENT ON TO THE MEETING AND
[1:34:21] BROTHER BAXTER WAS SITTING THERE PLAYING
[1:34:23] NOTHING BETWEEN my soul and the savior.
[1:34:26] He come in and said, "Thought you wasn't
[1:34:28] coming." I said, "Sh." Went on up and
[1:34:31] just started preaching.
[1:34:34] When I got through, about the time I got
[1:34:36] through preaching,
[1:34:40] boy, it sound like somebody took the
[1:34:42] back of the building back there in a
[1:34:44] great big auditorium.
[1:34:47] THEY RAN AN EXTENSION MIC BACK THERE AND
[1:34:50] THERE was a woman back there walking UP
[1:34:52] AND DOWN THAT AISLE SHOUTING AS HARD AS
[1:34:54] SHE COULD SHOUT.
[1:34:57] COME TO FIND OUT, SHE HAD TB. THEY LEFT
[1:35:00] THE TWIN CITIES, ST. PAUL. THE AMBULANCE
[1:35:03] WOULDN'T BRING her because they was
[1:35:05] afraid she'd burst her lungs. AND THE
[1:35:08] DOCTOR SAID ANYTHING HER LUNGS WAS LIKE
[1:35:11] HONEYCOMBS.
[1:35:13] And if they ever broke SHE'D BE DEAD,
[1:35:15] THEY'D BE ALL some saints took AN OLD 38
[1:35:19] CHEVROLET CAR AND TOOK THE BACK SEAT AND
[1:35:22] FIXED IT UP. Put her in there and was on
[1:35:25] the road over AND THEY HIT A LITTLE BUMP
[1:35:28] OR SOMETHING OR ANOTHER AND SHE STARTED
[1:35:30] HEMORRHAGING.
[1:35:34] AND SHE STARTED SPURTING BLOOD OUT. IT
[1:35:38] WAS GOING TO HER NOSE. [snorts] She got
[1:35:41] weaker and weaker.
[1:35:45] SHE DIDN'T WANT TO DIE IN THE CAR. SO,
[1:35:47] SHE TOLD HIM TO STOP AND PUT HER ON A
[1:35:50] grass plat. And they picked her out. And
[1:35:53] they was all standing over praying.
[1:35:56] And all of a sudden she said
[1:35:59] something struck her.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Oh glory.
[1:36:05] [snorts] Oh may pass by this way tonight
[1:36:08] and strike some of you all.
[1:36:11] [snorts]
[1:36:12] Something struck her. Hallelujah.
[1:36:17] And she got up and away she went
[1:36:20] shouting down the road.
[1:36:24] Hallelujah.
[1:36:26] As hard AS SHE COULD. HERE SHE WAS AT
[1:36:29] CHURCH JUST WALKING UP AND DOWN THOSE
[1:36:31] AISLES. I SAID, "SISTER, WHAT TIME WAS
[1:36:34] THAT?" Just exactly the same time, the
[1:36:37] Holy Spirit was speaking through me.
[1:36:40] What was it? Gifts.
[1:36:44] [snorts]
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Gifts.
[1:36:48] You mean we as saints,
[1:36:52] WE MAY NOT EVEN BE ABLE TO SPEAK OUR OWN
[1:36:55] MOTHER tongue
[1:36:57] very well.
[1:37:00] WE MIGHT BE SO IGNORANT THAT PEOPLE
[1:37:03] WOULD LAUGH TO HEAR US TALK.
[1:37:07] But in heaven,
[1:37:10] we have such rapport with God
[1:37:15] that God would tell his angel,
[1:37:18] "Give him your tongue.
[1:37:21] My daughter has a need."
[1:37:25] Father, you want me to say it? I don't
[1:37:27] want to hear you say it.
[1:37:30] I just want you to give him your tongue
[1:37:36] and let him say it.
[1:37:44] [snorts]
[1:37:47] BECAUSE YOU SEE IN SOME ways our
[1:37:50] position
[1:37:52] is greater
[1:37:54] than the angels of God.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; When we're singing in the redemption
[1:38:04] stories and the angels will bow their
[1:38:06] heads.
[1:38:09] Don't know what we're talking about.
[1:38:11] Sure, they never was lost. They don't
[1:38:13] know what it is. They don't know how
[1:38:15] good we feel to know we were once
[1:38:19] sinners and alienated from God. without
[1:38:21] hope, WITHOUT MERCY FROM GOD, WITHOUT
[1:38:23] GOD. OH MY. WITHOUT GOD, in a world of
[1:38:26] corruption, DYING, GOING TO A DEVIL'S
[1:38:28] HELL, and God stooped down and picked us
[1:38:31] up
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; AND REDEEMED US, and now we're above the
[1:38:36] angels
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; right now.
[1:38:46] It ain't no wonder the devil don't want
[1:38:49] you and I to see who we are.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; If it can get us so busy with life and
[1:38:59] sickness and affliction and one worry
[1:39:01] after another and one frustration after
[1:39:03] another and get us constantly caught up
[1:39:06] in just the element of time instead of a
[1:39:09] sin, we are called to do things like
[1:39:12] this.
[1:39:15] Hallelujah.
[1:39:18] Hallelujah.
[1:39:23] WHICH IS IT? AN ANGEL'S A SERVANT.
[1:39:28] WE'RE SONS AND DAUGHTERS. WHICH IS THE
[1:39:30] MOST THOUGHT OF, YOUR servant or your
[1:39:34] son or daughter? Oh my. Prayer from a
[1:39:37] saint
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; will go a million times higher.
[1:39:43] that an angel.
[1:39:47] So you mean your prayer
[1:39:51] of you saints
[1:39:53] which have mistakes and failures and
[1:39:56] faults and flaws.
[1:40:00] And yet if you ask Father for something,
[1:40:02] your prayer, Brother Joe, WOULD GO A
[1:40:05] million times higher than an angel which
[1:40:09] has never lied, never sinned, never fell
[1:40:11] short of the glory of God.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; But in all reality, how many of us
[1:40:20] believe that statement?
[1:40:23] Amen.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Or do we go to God in prayer,
[1:40:30] shamefaced?
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Do we go to God like slaves and
[1:40:35] servants?
[1:40:37] Do we go to God only with crumb
[1:40:39] mentality?
[1:40:44] We're living in a day, my friends, when
[1:40:46] the seven course meal has been served.
[1:40:49] I'm not interested in seven crumbs. I
[1:40:52] want the seven course.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; If God wants TO HAND ME A CRUMB, I'LL
[1:40:58] TAKE IT. BUT IF he wants to hand me a
[1:40:59] seven course meal, make room for me at
[1:41:02] the table. Praise be to God. IF GOD'S
[1:41:05] GOT SALAD AND SOUP and whatever more and
[1:41:07] he's got the entree and he's got the
[1:41:09] desserts piled a mile high, bring them
[1:41:11] on, God. If my name's on that place, I
[1:41:14] love it whenever I go to weddings and
[1:41:16] things like that. And I've been to them,
[1:41:17] you know, in different parts of the
[1:41:18] world and when banquetss and things that
[1:41:20] we have and they'll say, "Never brother
[1:41:22] Donnie, we have a special table for you
[1:41:24] and Sister Carol and we'll get in
[1:41:25] there." Generally Carol finds it first
[1:41:27] and see where we are and I all I got to
[1:41:29] do is look for her and there she'll be
[1:41:31] waving. I go over and I sit down. You
[1:41:33] know what? They may have brother so and
[1:41:35] so and brother so and so, but I know
[1:41:37] exactly where to sit down and I find my
[1:41:41] name and I find my wife and she found
[1:41:45] her name and my name and I know where
[1:41:48] I'm supposed to be by her side. If we as
[1:41:51] THE CHILDREN OF GOD COULD EVER FIND OUR
[1:41:54] NAME, WHO WE ARE, WE ARE NOT WRETCHED
[1:41:58] LOST SINNERS. WE ARE NOT A BUNCH OF
[1:42:01] TRASH. WE ARE THE ELECTED OF GOD. WE ARE
[1:42:05] THE REDEEMED BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. AND
[1:42:08] IF WE FIND OUR NAME AND FIND OUR
[1:42:11] HUSBAND, WE'LL FIND OUR PLACE AT THE
[1:42:14] TABLE. NOT UNDER THE TABLE LIKE A DOG.
[1:42:20] [applause]
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; [gasps]
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Which is the most thought of, your
[1:42:31] servant or your son or your daughter? Oh
[1:42:33] my. Prayer from a saint will go a
[1:42:36] million miles higher than an angel. Yes,
[1:42:39] sir. Because he's a son. Oh, that's
[1:42:43] right. My brother, sister, the church. I
[1:42:47] don't believe this side of eternity.
[1:42:50] I will ever realize what you are. THE
[1:42:55] POSITION THAT YOU ARE THAT GOD HAS
[1:42:58] PLACED YOU. YOU SPIRITFILLED PEOPLE.
[1:43:00] You're sons of God. WHY? ANGEL'S A
[1:43:04] SERVANT. You're a son. Isn't this an
[1:43:08] angel can only bring you a message, but
[1:43:12] you have to act.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Don't you understand? In every age, the
[1:43:19] actors have been on the scene. AND THE
[1:43:22] ANGEL OF GOD, DON'T YOU SEE WHY THE
[1:43:24] BREACH had to preede the opening of the
[1:43:26] seals even in 1963? And when the angels
[1:43:30] come and the prophet AT THE END OF IT
[1:43:31] TELLS US each angel came each day
[1:43:36] bringing the message
[1:43:39] that was made known unto him.
[1:43:42] So Paul's THEOPHONY
[1:43:45] BROUGHT THE ANGELIC message
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; of the first seal.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; YES SIR.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; THE SECOND DAY, THE SECOND CHURCH AGE
[1:43:53] MESSENGER, THIRD, FOURTH, FIFTH, SIXTH.
[1:43:57] But can you imagine on that seventh day
[1:43:59] into the seventh seal when the prophet
[1:44:01] of God is there praying
[1:44:04] and into the room don't come Peter,
[1:44:06] James or John,
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Who was it? Him. Right.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Well, I better call 911. Somebody's
[1:44:15] going to pass out.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; The mystery. He was caught up INTO THAT
[1:44:19] PYRAMID OF THOSE SEVEN ANGELS. AND HE
[1:44:22] SAID, "THAT noted angel." Remember I
[1:44:25] told you that noted angel with had his
[1:44:28] wings all pointed back. The one that
[1:44:30] looked all noted, he seemed special to
[1:44:33] me.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; That seventh angel.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Now,
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; I imagine I'd really be fired up if I
[1:44:40] seen your angel, BROTHER RANDY. SISTER
[1:44:42] JANET, I IMAGINE I'D BE FIRED UP IF I
[1:44:45] seen your angel. But I'll tell you who'd
[1:44:47] fire me up more than seeing yours,
[1:44:49] Brother Larry, would be my own.
[1:44:52] Hallelujah. YOU IMAGINE WHEN THE PROPHET
[1:44:55] OF GOD WAS CALLED UP INTO THAT
[1:44:57] CONSTELLATION of the seven angels and
[1:44:59] then each angel came each day,
[1:45:02] HALLELUJAH TO GOD, AND BROUGHT THE
[1:45:04] MYSTERY OF GOD. YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT
[1:45:06] WAS, FRIEND? THE PREACHING OF THOSE
[1:45:08] SEALS WAS CHRIST. THE WHOLE WORD WAS
[1:45:11] [screaming] CHRIST. AND THE THING HE
[1:45:12] SAID I WONDERED ABOUT MY WHOLE LIFE.
[1:45:15] THAT SEVEN SEAL. WHAT WAS IT? AN
[1:45:17] IDENTIFICATION. A RELEASING OF TEARING
[1:45:20] OFF THE SEALS. ALSO A RELEASING of
[1:45:23] angels.
[1:45:25] HALLELUJAH. A RELEASING OF ANGELS.
[1:45:31] Oh Jesus.
[1:45:34] Let's stand. Let's stand.
[1:45:43] [applause]
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; An angel can only bring you a message,
[1:45:54] but you have to act.
[1:45:57] Amen.
[1:45:59] You're the actor on the scene.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; You're the son.
[1:46:04] The angels of servants
[1:46:08] to bring you the message said here I
[1:46:11] brought you this message for you to do
[1:46:14] so and so. This is from father
[1:46:18] I bring it to you. Yes. That's that's
[1:46:20] all it is. Amen. You're your sons and
[1:46:22] daughters of God.
[1:46:26] Spoken words original seed. The unic
[1:46:30] been up with all the DDs and the LDS and
[1:46:33] everything.
[1:46:34] But why didn't he get something? He come
[1:46:37] back down studying the prophecy of
[1:46:39] Isaiah. Although an angel directed
[1:46:43] Philillip to him,
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; but the germ of life
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; had to come through the tape player when
[1:46:52] you press play
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; and obey.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; If you believe and preach that, you're
[1:47:01] preaching damnable lies.
[1:47:07] tape player is not the token.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; It's being said
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; that the message itself is the token.
[1:47:15] God's prophet told us the life of Jesus
[1:47:18] Christ was the token.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. That's what we
[1:47:23] believe at this church. IT'S THE LIFE OF
[1:47:26] THE LORD JESUS. NOT A BOOK, NOT A TAPE,
[1:47:29] NOT A PREACHER, NOT A CHURCH. AMEN.
[1:47:33] That's [applause and cheering] right.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Although an angel directed Philillip to
[1:47:38] him,
[1:47:40] but the germ of life
[1:47:42] had to come through
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; the body.
[1:47:47] Philillip, oh brother, now we're on the
[1:47:49] line. Where did the germ come from?
[1:47:52] Through the angel. The angel showed him
[1:47:54] where to go. An angel is a messenger.
[1:47:57] Here's a son. PHILIP HAD THE GERM. THE
[1:48:01] MESSAGE,
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; the word.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; That's how a child can be born.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Philip laid his hands upon him. Philip
[1:48:12] baptized him. Oh, glory to God. In the
[1:48:15] name of Jesus Christ, there come forth
[1:48:17] the spirit of God. Now, the germ had to
[1:48:21] come from the body. What body? Christ
[1:48:25] body. Correct.
[1:48:27] and Philillip [snorts]
[1:48:29] was a member
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; of that body.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; That's why Satan don't want us gathering
[1:48:36] together.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; That's why Satan wants to get people
[1:48:39] disbelieve in the ministry in the end
[1:48:41] time. Come on, somebody. The devil knows
[1:48:44] you'll never get born again just by
[1:48:46] assembling somewhere AND PRESSING PLAY.
[1:48:49] AMEN. IT DON'T PASS THROUGH A TAPE. IT
[1:48:52] DON'T PASS THROUGH A MAGNETIC DEVICE.
[1:48:54] IT'S GOT TO COME THROUGH THE BODY. A
[1:48:56] TAPE PLAYER IS NOT A PART OF THE BODY OF
[1:48:59] CHRIST. A CD PLAYER IS NOT OF THE PART
[1:49:02] OF THE BODY OF CHRIST. IT MUST BE FLESH
[1:49:05] AND BONES THAT HAS BEEN REDEEMED BY THE
[1:49:08] POWER OF THE LAMB OF GOD.
[1:49:13] [applause]
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Can I read one more? NOW LISTEN. THE
[1:49:21] SAME THING TOOK PLACE IN ACTS 10:48.
[1:49:23] Peter was on the housetop. An angel
[1:49:26] direct him to Cornelius's house. But
[1:49:29] where did the word come from the body?
[1:49:33] Oh, I feel pretty good. Feel like
[1:49:35] traveling on. An angel come and said,
[1:49:36] "Don't worry. Don't call nothing
[1:49:38] unclean." Go on down. Look here. This
[1:49:40] angel had to come and bring him the
[1:49:41] message. But the angel couldn't go down
[1:49:43] there and lead these people to be born
[1:49:44] again.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; God had to use a faulty, frail human
[1:49:50] being. Why angels aren't part of
[1:49:53] Christ's body?
[1:49:55] Lord, children,
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; ANGELS ARE NOT BAPTIZED
[1:50:02] INTO THE mystical body.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; EVERY ONE OF YOU TONIGHT THAT'S GOT THE
[1:50:07] HOLY GHOST HAVE GOT SOMETHING THAT
[1:50:09] ANGELS don't have.
[1:50:17] And whilst Peter spake these words, not
[1:50:21] the angel, not the cardinal, while Peter
[1:50:25] spake these words, what? He was the
[1:50:28] body. He had the word. The word took
[1:50:32] hold. Oh brother, whom don't you love
[1:50:35] them Harvard words.
[1:50:40] Oh my. OH BRETHREN. WOO. OH MY ANGEL
[1:50:46] DIRECTED IT.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; BUT the life
[1:50:50] come through the body of Christ.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; A tape player is not the body.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; I don't care how much you try to make it
[1:50:59] a live ministry. It is a recording.
[1:51:06] And always some man picks out which one
[1:51:09] he wants you to hear.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; That's the thing about sitting under a
[1:51:13] preacher.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; All of y'all don't get a remote and then
[1:51:17] when I go to saying something you don't
[1:51:18] like. You go.
[1:51:21] As I was saying, God knows why you all
[1:51:24] cannot live right. GOD UNDERSTAND. I'LL
[1:51:26] TELL YOU ONE THING. YOU GLANCE AGAIN.
[1:51:29] BUT Jesus loves you in spite of
[1:51:31] everything. And then you like that part.
[1:51:34] Jesus loves you in spot. No, preachers
[1:51:36] don't come with remotes. Well, yeah,
[1:51:38] they do, but he controls it.
[1:51:43] [applause]
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Think of it, children.
[1:51:51] You young people
[1:51:54] that are filled with the Holy Ghost,
[1:51:55] going to your school, going to college,
[1:51:59] going to your job,
[1:52:02] you go over and make pretzels and you
[1:52:03] make donuts and you you're bagging
[1:52:05] groceries and whatever that you're
[1:52:08] doing, walking down the miles at ETSU
[1:52:11] and feeling all by yourself. Don't you
[1:52:13] never think that
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; there's a host with you?
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; And you're packing the seed of God.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Don't you love it with all your hearts?
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Angels must inspire us, but we
[1:52:40] are the actors.
[1:52:45] We are the actors.
[1:52:48] Let's bury it.
[1:52:51] Young people, may I speak to you right
[1:52:53] now?
[1:52:55] Don't wait,
[1:52:57] young people, until myself and brother
[1:53:00] Daryl and these other ministers here
[1:53:03] till we all die and go off the field and
[1:53:05] then you all get on fire for God. Get on
[1:53:08] fire right now. Now is your time.
[1:53:12] If the Lord carries, there's future
[1:53:15] pastors wives may be here. Future
[1:53:17] evangelist wives, future deacons and
[1:53:20] deacons wives,
[1:53:24] but remember, you're part of that body
[1:53:25] right now if you have the Holy Ghost.
[1:53:28] And there might be somebody at the place
[1:53:30] you work or somebody at ETSU or the
[1:53:33] hospital or wherever it is that I'll
[1:53:36] never see. Brother Daryl will never run
[1:53:37] into him.
[1:53:40] And the only way they'll ever know about
[1:53:42] Jesus, the real Jesus, is through you.
[1:53:47] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:53:50] How many love to be remembered tonight?
[1:53:53] Lord, help me. I'm a housewife. I'm a
[1:53:54] farmer. Lord, I just pick up converters
[1:53:57] and take them from point A to point B.
[1:53:59] Lord, I I paint a house. I Lord, I I
[1:54:01] deliver propane gas. Lord, I I do this
[1:54:04] or that or the other.
[1:54:07] But you're a part of the body of Christ
[1:54:11] and you're packing his
[1:54:14] seat.
[1:54:17] Don't you understand, friends, what he's
[1:54:19] done different than he'd done to Eve?
[1:54:23] Eve only had her eggs,
[1:54:27] which left her womb fertile
[1:54:31] and left room for Satan to pregnant her.
[1:54:35] But Jesus not only gave us a soul, a
[1:54:39] womb, spiritual womb to be able to
[1:54:41] conceive seed,
[1:54:43] but he has sealed our womb.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; We cannot commit adultery.
[1:54:52] How can a womb be sealed when it
[1:54:54] receives the life from its mate?
[1:54:58] So we not only have the eggs that the
[1:55:00] church bears, but we have his life which
[1:55:03] has been deposited in us which seals us
[1:55:07] from adultery.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; But also gives us the power and the
[1:55:12] ability to propagate
[1:55:15] our husband.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; And produce another son of God. Another
[1:55:21] daughter of God. Another son of God.
[1:55:25] another daughter of God.
[1:55:30] Lord Jesus,
[1:55:32] thank you tonight, Father.
[1:55:35] Oh Lord, thank you.
[1:55:38] I hope they don't think I'm beside
[1:55:40] myself.
[1:55:42] Lord, open our eyes.
[1:55:46] Help us to see. [laughter]
[1:55:49] Lord Jesus, we were once lost. We were
[1:55:53] wretched. We were blind
[1:55:57] but not anymore.
[1:56:00] We pack within us
[1:56:02] the very seed of our husband.
[1:56:06] Hallelujah.
[1:56:09] We have access
[1:56:15] access to the presence of God.
[1:56:19] And if we need it at times
[1:56:22] to angelic tongues,
[1:56:26] no doubt there's people right here in
[1:56:28] this place tonight
[1:56:30] that have witnessed it
[1:56:34] in their own life, maybe in their home,
[1:56:36] maybe in their closet, wherever they
[1:56:38] were praying, the spirit of God just
[1:56:40] come to them and they prayed and
[1:56:42] somebody come on their heart that didn't
[1:56:44] even know what they were saying.
[1:56:47] And yet the spirit of God moved.
[1:56:51] Oh Jesus.
[1:56:54] Lord God, we desire to have the kind of
[1:56:56] homes and the kind of church that your
[1:57:00] angels can visit.
[1:57:03] Hallelujah.
[1:57:07] Hallelujah.
[1:57:09] How many wants it tonight with all your
[1:57:11] heart? Would you just raise your hand to
[1:57:12] the Lord?
[1:57:16] Brother John gets in dinner,
[1:57:20] I don't know if you even know this or
[1:57:22] not,
[1:57:24] but many years ago, Brother John's
[1:57:26] sister
[1:57:28] was terribly, terribly sick. Sister
[1:57:29] Gail, Brother Wilson's wife,
[1:57:32] come to me again today, and Carol and I
[1:57:34] went to see her, and
[1:57:36] bless her heart, she was in terrible
[1:57:38] shape.
[1:57:41] We fell on her knees there beside the
[1:57:43] bed.
[1:57:45] and the spirit of God come in the room
[1:57:48] and I started speaking in a a tongue
[1:57:55] that I had never heard before. I never
[1:57:58] experienced before. I don't know how to
[1:58:01] describe it to you,
[1:58:03] but it's like the presence of God was
[1:58:06] just going to Sister Gail,
[1:58:09] but there was nothing said
[1:58:12] as far as interpretation of it.
[1:58:17] But that presence was there for I don't
[1:58:20] know how long
[1:58:23] and then it changed
[1:58:25] and in a few minutes another language
[1:58:28] went into
[1:58:30] into another direction
[1:58:33] and then from there it started speaking
[1:58:35] and
[1:58:37] an interpretation but not one word was
[1:58:39] said to sister Gail
[1:58:43] but it was all to brother Wilson
[1:58:46] to encourage him to lift him up
[1:58:51] to help him.
[1:58:54] Carol and I left our house there that
[1:58:55] day and we got in the car and she said,
[1:58:58] "Donnie, what'd you think?" I said,
[1:59:01] "It didn't seem like to me
[1:59:05] that she was going to live." She said,
[1:59:06] "That's what I thought
[1:59:09] from what the Lord was saying."
[1:59:13] Think of a children
[1:59:16] that we can live in his presence and
[1:59:18] walk with him.
[1:59:22] And if he needs to use somebody,
[1:59:25] you don't have to be a preacher.
[1:59:29] You mamas have got the authority. Your
[1:59:31] babies at home sick. You got the
[1:59:33] authority to lay your hand over on that
[1:59:35] child's head and rebuke that fever.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; Don't have to be just Brother Daryl. Oh,
[1:59:43] Brother Daryl's out of town. Oh yes,
[1:59:45] we've seen God do a lot through Brother
[1:59:46] Daryl. That same God wants you to have
[1:59:48] faith in Brother Daryl's in New Zealand
[1:59:50] or Australia that you got enough
[1:59:52] confidence in who you are as a son or
[1:59:55] daughter of God.
[2:00:00] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:00:14] How many has needs tonight in the in the
[2:00:16] in the in
[2:00:18] in the church, your body, your home?
[2:00:21] You see these people standing around
[2:00:23] you,
[2:00:25] want you to lay your hand on them right
[2:00:27] now.
[2:00:33] Oh my. If we
[2:00:36] if God would allow our eyes to come open
[2:00:38] and we'd be able to see
[2:00:41] setting up down these aisles of the
[2:00:43] angels of God, oh man, we would we would
[2:00:47] scream and holler and we'd probably fall
[2:00:49] down and oh God, oh God,
[2:00:53] to see them angels here.
[2:00:56] But that man or woman that's got their
[2:00:58] hand on you, that young boy, that young
[2:01:00] girl,
[2:01:03] son or daughter of God,
[2:01:05] their prayer will go a million miles
[2:01:08] higher
[2:01:10] than that angel.
[2:01:14] We're going to pray for each other now.
[2:01:20] Heavenly Father, angels
[2:01:23] can inspire,
[2:01:26] but we
[2:01:28] are the actors.
[2:01:30] It's written in your word,
[2:01:34] they shall lay their hands
[2:01:37] on the sick
[2:01:39] and they shall recover. And your prophet
[2:01:41] quotes that and said it didn't even say
[2:01:44] they'd have to pray.
[2:01:47] that just simply laid their hands on
[2:01:49] them.
[2:01:50] Why? They're a part of the body.
[2:01:54] Healing can flow
[2:01:57] out of one daughter of God into another.
[2:02:01] I'm reminded of that sister Lord up in
[2:02:04] brother Rand's meeting that time way up
[2:02:05] high.
[2:02:07] She kept seeing this little mother with
[2:02:08] this crying baby walk back and forth and
[2:02:11] she felt so sorry for her. She offered
[2:02:13] her her chair and she told her, said,
[2:02:16] "Honey, I I see you got a prayer card,
[2:02:18] but the Lord just keeps putting it on my
[2:02:21] heart. Would you mind if I prayed for
[2:02:23] your little baby? I know brother Ram's
[2:02:24] going to pray for." She said, "Why sure,
[2:02:26] sister?"
[2:02:29] She prayed for that baby.
[2:02:32] The prophet come out and preach that
[2:02:33] discernment.
[2:02:35] Calls a woman out and tells her, said
[2:02:38] that sister there standing by, you're
[2:02:39] sitting down near you.
[2:02:42] She prayed for your baby. The Lord's
[2:02:44] already healed your baby.
[2:02:47] Why God wanted to use a mother
[2:02:52] cuz she could feel what that mother
[2:02:55] could feel.
[2:02:57] Maybe a teenage boy tonight that's
[2:03:00] fighting a real battle.
[2:03:03] Maybe he needs to go lay his hand on
[2:03:05] another teenage brother
[2:03:07] because they got similar battles. Same
[2:03:09] with the young sister.
[2:03:12] Maybe two sisters going through the
[2:03:14] change of life and
[2:03:17] you'll put it on each other's hearts.
[2:03:20] Oh Jesus, I just pray you'd help us.
[2:03:24] Lord, that we can love like you love.
[2:03:28] This is why you became us,
[2:03:32] so we could become you. You wanted to
[2:03:35] feel our pain, our anxiety,
[2:03:38] our frustration.
[2:03:41] You become weary with life.
[2:03:44] You were sick,
[2:03:46] disappointed in people, and let down.
[2:03:52] Help me, Jesus, when I feel that way.
[2:03:56] Help my people, Lord, when they feel
[2:03:58] that way.
[2:04:01] We worship you, Lord God.
[2:04:04] We bless your name, Lord Jesus. May the
[2:04:07] angels of God
[2:04:11] They'll be able to energize our faith.
[2:04:15] Hallelujah.
[2:04:17] May they part their wings
[2:04:20] and distill drops of mercy.
[2:04:24] Distilled drops of healing.
[2:04:28] Hallelujah.
[2:04:30] Hallelujah.
[2:04:32] In the name of Jesus, may the oppressed
[2:04:36] be set free.
[2:04:38] May the weary be delivered. Lord God,
[2:04:44] we worship you now. Father,
[2:04:48] we call it done
[2:04:51] in the name of our bridegroom,
[2:04:54] the Lord Jesus.
[2:04:57] For we are mates who stepped out of
[2:05:00] eternity together
[2:05:02] in a body called time.
[2:05:06] And one day you will descend from heaven
[2:05:08] with a shout
[2:05:11] and you will call us out of time.
[2:05:15] And we will ascend back to heaven
[2:05:18] together
[2:05:20] eternal mates
[2:05:22] forever
[2:05:24] and ever and ever.
[2:05:28] And we will never part.
[2:05:31] Lord Jesus,
[2:05:34] we adore you, Father.
[2:05:37] We magnify your holy name tonight, Lord
[2:05:40] God.
[2:05:44] Oh Jesus, we worship you.
[2:05:48] Let's just love him a little. Now,
[2:05:50] children,
[2:05:52] if you got to go, go on. You got
[2:05:53] children, you work. I understand all
[2:05:55] that. I'm not trying to make it hard on
[2:05:58] you. But oh my goodness, with this
[2:06:00] presence that's here tonight.
[2:06:02] Oh, let's just just make it last as long
[2:06:05] as we can.
[2:06:09] I have to fight through hell to get to
[2:06:12] this.
[2:06:14] When I get here, I don't care if I
[2:06:16] leave. I don't care
[2:06:19] what time it is when we go.
[2:06:22] Oh Jesus,
[2:06:25] we worship you, Father.
[2:06:29] Hallelujah, Lord.
[2:06:33] Hallelu, Lord Jesus.
[2:06:37] Let's just raise our hands now if you
[2:06:39] will and close your eyes. If your hands
[2:06:41] get tired, sure, you can take them down.
[2:06:43] Take a rest and put them back up again.
[2:06:45] Sing something for us here.
[2:06:48] Let's worship him together now.
[2:06:52] Now, he needs you
[2:06:55] to do something. angels
[2:06:58] cannot do. That's act in his place.
[2:07:02] Now he's also asking something from you
[2:07:06] which angels cannot give him.
[2:07:10] Praise from redeemed lips.
[2:07:17] He's wanting you tonight
[2:07:20] to love him. He's wanting to take our
[2:07:23] hearts
[2:07:24] and be our lover,
[2:07:27] our Lord,
[2:07:29] our King. He wants to There's two little
[2:07:32] doves sitting on a power line when they
[2:07:36] lock their little necks around one
[2:07:37] another.
[2:07:47] And to you he would say, "I loved you
[2:07:50] before the world began."
[2:07:58] And you say back, "I receive that with
[2:08:02] all of my soul. My Lord,
[2:08:11] I don't ever remember you being anything
[2:08:14] but my son.
[2:08:17] or my daughter
[2:08:19] and you answer back,
[2:08:21] I believe that
[2:08:24] cuz my sins are in the depths of the
[2:08:28] sea.
[2:08:30] Now remember that sea metaphorically
[2:08:32] called the sea of forgetfulness.
[2:08:35] But one day there won't be no sea of
[2:08:38] forgetfulness like John saw no more sea.
[2:08:41] It won't be needed.
[2:08:43] Even you won't remember your sins.
[2:08:48] Let's coup to him.
[2:08:51] Let's love him.
[2:08:54] Oh Jesus.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.

[2:13:56] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:14:00] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:14:02] Thank you. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:14:06] Father, right now
[2:14:09] I call the name, Lord God,
[2:14:13] of Sister Teresa Carter. Do you know
[2:14:16] what she's in need of this very night?
[2:14:20] In the name of Jesus, may the angel of
[2:14:23] God go to our sister,
[2:14:27] Brother Sam Wo. Father, in the name of
[2:14:30] Jesus, you see the need of our brother.
[2:14:34] Lord, I call Ellie's name tonight. Not
[2:14:37] able to come to church. May the spirit
[2:14:40] of God go there to her now, Father.
[2:14:44] others. Lord, no doubt prayer request
[2:14:47] was turned in for them that I didn't
[2:14:49] hear, but you know who they are. In the
[2:14:52] name of Jesus, would you go to your
[2:14:55] children,
[2:14:57] Lord? You so wanted us to be workers
[2:14:59] with you
[2:15:02] that you were standing there that day,
[2:15:04] the Lord of the harvest,
[2:15:07] and you told your disciples, "Pray that
[2:15:09] the Lord of the harvest will send labors
[2:15:13] into the field." And brother Brandham
[2:15:15] phrases it like this. And he says, there
[2:15:18] he was standing, the Lord of the
[2:15:20] harvest. And he said, "Pray and ask me
[2:15:23] to do what I know needs to be done."
[2:15:29] But you wanted them to ask you to do it.
[2:15:34] So we're asking you, Jesus,
[2:15:37] bring the last members of your bride in.
[2:15:42] Fill the last ones with the Holy Ghost.
[2:15:44] Lord,
[2:15:46] bring back backsliders, Lord Jesus,
[2:15:49] whose names are on the book.
[2:15:53] Lord, bring in the last ones
[2:15:56] so we can go home.
[2:15:59] Anoint your evangelists. Anoint your
[2:16:01] pastors. Anoint the teachers.
[2:16:04] Anoint men of God like never before.
[2:16:08] Lord God, may the sacredness of the hour
[2:16:11] begin with the ministry.
[2:16:14] I wonder, Lord, sometimes, and I just
[2:16:16] can't keep from believing that some
[2:16:18] preachers have lost the sacredness of
[2:16:21] what it means to be a preacher,
[2:16:24] the sacredness to stand behind this
[2:16:26] desk.
[2:16:28] They use it as a place to get even and
[2:16:31] to throw things at people and preach on
[2:16:34] people and settle scores. What a shame.
[2:16:38] What a disgrace that a preacher would
[2:16:40] use a pullpit for such a thing. Lord
[2:16:45] God, bring the ministry back to a
[2:16:47] sacredness. Father,
[2:16:50] oh, we've got the quotes of the message,
[2:16:52] but do we have the sacredness the
[2:16:55] messenger had? Help us, Father. Lord,
[2:17:00] the same with the leoty. You've given us
[2:17:02] this place, Lord. But may they realize
[2:17:05] this is a sacred place.
[2:17:08] This is a holy place. It's not a place
[2:17:10] to laugh and cut up. Oh, but God, angels
[2:17:13] are in this place. Your presence is
[2:17:17] here. Hallelujah.
[2:17:20] We're on holy ground.
[2:17:23] We are on holy ground.
[2:17:28] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:17:31] We worship you tonight, Father.
[2:17:35] Praise be to God.
[2:17:38] Amen. How many can say it's been good to
[2:17:41] be in the house of the Lord.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you saints. I'm going to
[2:17:49] let you go. Sing something for us,
[2:17:50] Harry. And we'll we'll let you go. I'll
[2:17:52] sing it Lord willing Sunday. Let's just
[2:17:54] come back expecting the Lord to speak to
[2:17:56] us again by his word. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:18:00] Morning. [singing]
