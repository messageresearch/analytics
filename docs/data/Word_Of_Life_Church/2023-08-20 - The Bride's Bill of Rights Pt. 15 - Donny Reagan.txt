[Applause] morning I'm sure most of us if we've been serving the lord very long we know that we have those times when we think morning will never come but is't it amazing it always has 1973 carollyn I hadn't been married very long and a tornado come through down in Kentucky where we lived we lived in a single wide trailer we lived about the way the crow flies Maybe 3/4 of a mile to a mile to where the that tornado hit it was lightning thundering raining wind they found horses in the tops of trees they found woven wire fence that was round up just like that and the fence post were still standing up they found drinking straws thrown into brick houses you've seen and heard of that before but what's amazing was Caroline and I didn't even know it hit we lived in a single wide Traer you can imagine that so we get out the next morning to go to work and we're seeing all this Devastation and thinking what in the world happened several people lost their lives it was a a terrible terrible thing houses destroyed livestock all types of things and yet we were totally unaware of it but there's been other storms I've been through and that you've been through I was well aware I was aware of the loss of life I was aware of the discouragement the sadness and all that went with it how many knows what I'm talking about but whether it's in a storm that God is so protecting you and helping you that you look back and you saying how did I ever make it and then you look at others and think that was close but either way you're going to make it amen aren't you glad we're not here today gathered thinking well maybe I might be able to make it till next Wednesday night no we can have such a relationship with God that no matter what takes place we know beyond a shadow of a doubt he's with us and his plan cannot and will not be destroyed amen and many believes that with all your heart 1 Peter 4:12 we welcome you today in the house of the Lord trust you've come to receive something from God not only to receive but to give something to God our love our adoration our praise our worship 1 Peter 4 verse 12 beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery tribe which is try to try you so apparently Peter felt like he needed to warn the people of God whenever heavy trials would come that they wouldn't look at it and think this is so strange why am I going through this how could it be allowed that I would deal with such trauma beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery look at the the word fiery what it means a burning the burning by which metals are roasted roasted so they're not just held over the fire and then pull them back but they're actually hung over the fire until they are roasted you know what I'm talking about where you stick a little cream puff marshmallow on the end of your stick and you hold it over the fire and you hold it there until the desired color change has arrived and then you pull it off and try to eat it without scorching your mouth right oh yeah or a hot dog and you stick it on the end of a stick and then it swells and swells and that's probably where some of you are today you're all swollen up but it's because of the fire a burning the burning which metals by which metals are roasted and and reduced by a figure drawn from a Refiner's Fire calamities or trials that test the character but Rejoice oh well that's good that's wonderful you after we're roasted now we Rejoice but rejoice in as much as wow ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings so you can imagine the trial that you go through now not self-inflicted of things that we do to ourself but that he and his wisdom allow us to come to pass and he actually attributes that to a suffering that you have done with him it's as if though you were hanging on a cross and you were being beaten and you were being stucked and you were being chastened that's the way he looks at it when we come through it Faithfully but rejoice in as much as your partakers of Christ sufferings listen to this part that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also praise the Lord with exceeding Joy if you be reproached for the name of Christ happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you on their part which is those that are not saved on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified aren't you glad that's your part today I made a l to be remembered as we pray today let's just bow our heads father we thank you for your word we thank you Lord for the songs that we've sung every prayer request every testimony thus far of the service I pray today Lord that you would help me to be able to get out of the way you alone can be able to custom fit a sermon that'll be able to meet the heart of every hungry person and Lord we know those that are streaming are many times over what's what's here gathered so I pray that you would help me Lord Jesus please help me to move aside help me father that I can be able to get out of the way and speak the words of Life dear God you so the hands that were uplifted signifying a need on many in their hearts and I pray you'd be mindful of them Father you see these prayer calls that I have today it's for three wayward children and their families Lord God we can look around and see the signs of your coming we can see how things are becoming so dark how can we not be concerned about our children our loved ones husband wife whoever it is that's out of the Ark of Safety Lord God be mindful of these three not only them but others are standing here today with friends and loved ones that are lost without you or backslidden would you be mindful Lord God we pray in the name of Jesus and the Saints said amen amen God bless you you may be seated we know the word teaches that no man or no woman that is looking for a companion for life life should make such a decision or such a choice without prayerfully prayerfully considering such a choice that choice can be such Agony and such difficulty in life if it's the wrong one if it's the right one a marriage can be a little bit of Heaven on Earth that's what God intended for it to be marriage is supposed to be a reflection of what heaven is going to be it's miniature Heaven you'll have battles and difficulties of course but you have your husband or wife to be able to help you through those things of life and this is why that we're instructed then before that we would decide on this man or this woman that we want to live the rest of our life with that we don't look so much at their financial status we don't look at where they fit in society how they say their nouns their pronouns you know how they know how to do this and that but are they matched to you as an individual and it really takes the Lord to help us to do that because we are so easily deceived when it comes to our emotions and we can think we're in love with somebody and then it doesn't take you know some people 6 months or a year others three or four years and then they realize that was not the person they thought they getting it all and then they begin to realize what a terrible terrible mistake that they made so we have the guidelines given to us in the word in the message of the hour to help us to be able to make such a decision as you've heard me or other men as they will stand there and go through the wedding things and and they will they will welcome you as the guest and then they will begin to go toward the vows and believing that you have consented toward God and toward yourselves I will now present to you the marriage covenant will you so and so take this woman to be your lawful wetted wife will you love her will you cherish her will you honor her so on and so on and so on and those vows are so easy to say when everybody's standing there and the the dresses are beautiful and the suits are all crisp and clean and pressed but then whenever you put away your beautiful wedding gown and the man takes off his tucks and then he starts wearing his old dirty tennis shoes and he starts taking off his clothes and piling them in a pile you didn't realize he' done that you thought he was a neat Freak no that was only until he got you and then once he got you he's going to revert back to being what he was the same old himy but you see God himself unlike us God has the ability to be able to look forward and to be able to see things that we cannot see and he is able to choose by his own choice who he wants to be in his bride but unlike us we try to choose one that matches us as best as we can and those that we feel like they're be a an area of compatibility and religion an area of compatibility and the way we're going to raise children our finances so on and so on and so on but inevitably there's going to be things that you're going to face in life and a you didn't discussed that did you you did not think about that and here you have your first big argument because you wanted to spend Christmas with your parents and you didn't realize he wanted to spend Christmas with his who live in Arizona so you didn't discuss how the holiday things is going to work out so then you've got this big argument and disagreement but yet if you really love one another you're able to work through it and somebody's going to have to give a little bit more than likely both of you but the difference between us and God is that God is able to look down through time and see every one of his kids and he placed an element of them in every age so he would always have someone to Bear witness of his light now there won't be many but there doesn't need to be but unlike us to where we wish we could change our husband or wife or maybe some of you do you wish wish you could change him and you wish you could modify this about him and that about him and maybe some of your brothers think I wish I could change her there's not a question in my mind that some of you probably wish you could change me as your pastor you wish I wouldn't do that and you wish I wouldn't say that and you wish I wouldn't do that can you imagine what kind of preacher I'd be if 600 people or so would be able to change me I'd be your style today and your style Wednesday and your style next Sunday I'd sort have to pre be preaching 25 times a week in order to get around everybody in a few months time but it God unlike us God has the ability of taking up junk absolutely off the scrap heap of humanity looks like worthless helpless hopeless of no value at all and start molding in those people what he knows he wants to be his bride now with us there's certain changes of course that can be made and we're all still make them because we love our companion and we want to do what we can to be able to get along in life but God doesn't have to have really a whole lot to work with so he saves us sanctifies us fills us with the Holy Ghost and quickens that seed that is down inside of us that he himself play place there now unlike us whenever we pick our mate we hope and we pray and we try to talk and sort through everything and we find little differences but we say well we can work through that but God has the ability to be able to take those which seem like are character less they have hardly any at all they come from the scum of Life they are some of them the offscouring of the world some of them are so far gone even the devil thought there's no hope for them and some of you probably thought just so far gone there was no hope for yourself but God has the ability unlike us to make such major major changes in people that he can pick a people which would not look like a wife and by the time he gets done with them they are the Elite of the elite totally unrecognizable their family don't know who they are their friends don't know who they are and they don't know who they are themselves because the spirit of God begins to work such a work in their lives and totally transforms them now we know the way he does this is he allows his own mind to be in us now if we all have the same mind today and we come to church for the same go same motive same objective we want to see God move in this place more than anything else and we are willing to do whatever we have to do to allow him to do so I wonder what kind of service we' have I wonder what kind of church would' have if we made up every one of us our mind from this day forward every service that I'm going to be in from this day forward I'm my motive is going to be to worship God I don't care what the people think about me I don't care if they like it or they don't like it I'm going to get in with all of my heart I'm not going to sit there like a bump on a pickle I'm going to amen the word I'm going to say praise God Brother Don ain't going to have to say and the church said to me brother Donnie ain't going to have to say let's everybody raise their hands to me because I'm a son or daughter of God and I'm going to do it because I'm ordained to do it wouldn't that be something if we all had that mind well if we did have that mind now this is what happened on the day of Pentecost that they were in one place and one Accord and they'd receive one mind but that mind was not yet the mind of Christ now the mind of Christ is that Supernatural element according to the teaching of the seven seal the mind of Christ is that Supernatural element which does not come by reading the Bible it does not come by listening to tapes it does not come by listening to me it does not come by listening to your favorite preacher whoever that is it can only come by a supernatural endowment of almighty God himself but you can see if God had found a way to be able to drop in every member of his bride the same mind they might be different cultures different colors different backgrounds so much about them that would be so different but if he could take the carnal mind out of each one of them and drop in his own mind then even though they would still be different in their makeup and difference of opinions about this and that but the mind that was in them would be of the same mind which would be the mind of Christ now what I just described to you is the bride that's going in the Rapture you see there's lots of folks around this message that will never be bride material they've got quotes they've got the doctrines of the message down path and they've got all this out and other we've seen over the last few years many of those and whenever the Bel the sign thing come around I know of preachers around this message that had been in this message for over 40 years and they turned away from it and said William Brandon was a false prophet well you see where the message was up here and never hear well come on now how could God ever give you his mind and acknowledge the word is true and then all of a sudden the same God let you know that you was in a in a cult well there ain't no way that's the spirit of God but if we all had the same mind you say is that attainable brother Donnie it's not only attainable it is prophecy now the mind that was in Christ Jesus is in every believer there is the soul Soul's in prison now November 1963 now the mind that was in Christ Jesus is in every believer there is the soul there is the soul so God changes our nature and God drops in the elect every one of them now this is not just the prophet and this is not just preachers only but every member of the elect has or will have if they don't have it yet the mind of Christ so they may become part of them come from India part of them from Africa and I've been in many of those parts and I've told you before you go there and the worship in India is totally different from that in Mexico and in South America and our worship here may be a little different from the northern brothers and sisters up in Ohio and Michigan places like that but yet when it comes right down to it every member of the Bride will have the same mind now Satan hates this so what he loves to do is to seow Discord and contention among the people and get them arguing over this Doctrine and that Doctrine and to a lot of the message folks that's all the message is anyway it's just a bunch of doctrines but this message is is not just a bunch of doctrines it is a message from God to get us ready for the Rapture in the last day is that right it was not a doctrine that died for you on the cross it was not a doctrine that raised from the dead it is not a Doctrine that's coming back for you it was a person amen and if you don't love that person with all of your heart I'll tell you one thing you better get to praying now God can be able to take people that it would seem as if though that would be no hope for them all to ever arise above their own sin and Fallen nature much less to rise into a super race now you see what God does and he takes those people and He will begin to mold them and shape them now he has years and years and years of his program before most of them and then what will happen he start shaping them and he does not unload it all of course at one time because he knows we could not take it we could not take the stress we could not take the anxiety that comes with a child of God I know I know the people out here in the world they're feeling it too they're feeling the stress you're not the only one but yet you put a foolish virgin in the footsteps of a righteous virgin a wise virgin and let them try to walk there in three or four weeks time that'd have their brains blowed out they couldn't take it there ain't no way in the world they could take it why because they don't have the spiritual metallurgical value inside of them now you said what were you you talking about I'm talking about Abraham being a silver dollar and lot being a penny so Abraham at a spiritual metallurgical value that a hundred lots a hundred Lots it would take to even come close to Abraham and you could never ever change the value of lot he hung around the messenger he hung around the message but yet it never did really change him he was a lot when he started he was a lot in the middle and he was a lot when he finished praise the Lord and Abraham was an Abraham whenever he was called of God I wish somebody would preach with me this morning he was an Abraham when he was backslid down in the land of Egypt he was an Abraham when he went over and was caught up again and said this is my sister not my wife he was still an Abraham come on somebody why because God had chosen him to be one of his now we look at Jacob and we look at Esau and We Know by reading the scripture and what the the prophet has told us about them that Esau was a much better man as far as a good person he was a much better good person than Jacob ever was he was a liar he was a supplanter he was a deceiver but the seed fell in Jacob not in Esau and God was able to take a man that no doubt his daddy looked at him and we know that his their father he actually preferred Esau above Jacob is that right and we know many times it'll be that way because there was no doubt things about Jacob that he thought how can this ever be the one that'll carry on the seed lineage of God how could Jacob ever do it why he's a deceiver he's a Shyer he's a trickster there ain't nothing in the world can ever get a hold of that boy oh yes there is his name is almighty God and when God got done with Jacob he turned him into a prince praise the Lord he turned him into a prince so only God can take a man like Jacob and turn him into a prince in so much that he wrestles with God himself but you know when God begins to set this in motion and we may look like that we're doing really good for a while and then the spirit of God will start turning up the pressure oh my how we all dislike pressure except this water pressure in our house isn't it aggravating if you live in a part of of of East Tennessee here where there's so many Hills and all that and the people down in the valley got a good 60 65 lbs pressure and in your house you got 45 and you're thinking we're hooked up to the same Elizabeth and water what in the world's going on I pay my water bill just like they do theirs I stand out there and wash my car and it takes two hours cuz I'm they stand out there in their garden hoses like a pressure washer they just washed all over everything all we we hate it cuz we got low pressure but how many Christians today want the pressure turned up on your life a you notice my hand didn't go up either now I know that's a reality because the Babs my son my son and my son-in-law and my daughter and their family and The Parkers live over the hill for me and Carol and they've got the offest bunch of water pressure that ever was and if I've got one of my garden hoses on and try to water a plant in the front I can't hardly do it at the same time because you're a't enough pressure to pray push up that hill apparently and to be able to get it out well that's the way people are sometimes that God chooses his and he will let the pressure come to them as he knows they are able to take it and if we're not careful we'll lose sight of the main goal of why he's doing this that is he's taking us and going to process us and turn us into a people that the angels of God will bow themselves before us when we walk down streets of gold is that going to happen by just the new birst it will not will that happen just by attending church it will not how will that happen when God begins to mold in us a character that will match him now think of it do any of y'all here today believe that God would marry a liar anybody anybody belied that God would marry a drunk prostitute hormonger dopic so whatever kind of woman God marries proves what kind of God he is just like a man when he picks a wife or a woman chooses a husband then it shows if she sees him as he is and marries him and then she looks and say well that's what I wanted that's the kind of man I wanted I wanted a man that cuss me out I wanted a man that wouldn't be true to me I wanted a man well you say well most of them never do that well if he's that type of a fell what do you figure that you're getting see we don't have the ability like God to be able to look in there and see a character which is there in the molding but it's laying there in seed form and yet it can be brought to it through years and years of testing and trying one of the largest diamonds that were found many years ago and they studied it and kept it for years and years before they ever cut it so they x-rayed it they put it through sonograms through different types of things because they're studying the light the way the light hits it now every Diamond almost every one of them is going to have an element of carbon on the inside and that is called inclusions whenever you're looking at diamonds and they want to study that diamond and see how they can cut it to get the most out of it because a diamond in the rough it does not have the ability to reflect light or release the fire as we say so they study that diamond and they look at it from this shape and that shape and and they cut it some of the most famous Diamond Cutters that there have been for centuries are the Jews and you know anything thing about diamonds know that Anor is where that the great Diamond Market comes from so before they would be able to take this diamond and cut it now should they just take it and cut it into one gigantic diamond or should they take it and cut it make one great big one and then some smaller ones and then some little bitty ones so they study it and they study it and they try to put in a computer graphic and figure that if they do it this way and they leave this one great big chunk of a diamond then would it be worth more would it have a greater historical value or would they be better off to take and cut it into multiple pieces well you see the Lord God did this the Lord God brought his great Diamond to the Earth it was himself in the form of a human being we called him the Lord Jesus and then God's great plan was not to leave this diamond in this gigantic perfect sinless form as the Son of God but his plan was to cut this diamond and take from him a piece and another piece and another piece and another piece and another piece because the way he looked at it it would bring him more glory and more honor if he had had multiple Sons and Daughters of God all over the Earth than it would be to have one perfect one on the throne of God in heaven the way he looked at it if he could multiply that one and cut off of him another and another and another and another now of course you those of you that are in construction you know you have Diamond coated blades saw blades Diamond coated this and that and the other and diamonds are used for all types of things and so the Lord God decided before the world ever began before there's ever a man there was a plan before a man was ever lost there was a cross so the Lord God decided that he would create himself in Diamond form and he would allow the light of all the Brilliance of his majesty to show forth down through time so in the beginning was the word and there he started so he had this program within himself and he wanted to divide himself and give me and you and every other son and daughter of God a portion of himself I don't want your spirit and you shouldn't want mine praise the Lord I don't want somebody else's Spirit you know the prophet said it over and over again I was looking at it last night studying and he said you walk into a church and he said you watch the pastor if the pastor jerks his head a certain way many times you find the people in the church doing exactly the same thing now he said if we're not careful we will find ourselves getting one another's spirit and S of the spirit of God now let me tell you how much I appreciate y'all not doing that today cuz when I get up I get real happy sometimes I'll shake that leg well I don't see hard to anybody else should do it some of his little boys do I know they do that kind of laughing at me but yet I'm glad that you don't want my spirit you don't want to jerk your hand or whatever like me you want to be the way God made you is that right now a lot of pastors that's what they want they want their Church to be little miniature Donnies or little miniature Tims or little miniature Rons I don't why in the world would I want you to be a little noad Donnie when you can be a miniature Lord Jesus Christ Living inside of your body praise the lord well don't you feel the same way why in the world would you want to be like me when you could be like him I've never understood that I've never understood why people would rather act like a preacher than they would like God but God himself decided to divide himself of course this is the term we've been looking at for a couple years now called kinosis so he empties himself of those attributes which would forbid him from elements of time and Humanity how could the Eternal ever break into into time so he laid aside kosis himself stepped out of that invisible form which cannot be seen into a visible tangible form in order to become like us and when he come to the Earth and when he arrived did he arrive with a perfect character now listen carefully the very character of Jesus himself was molded by suffering is that what the church hbook tells us so the character of the Lord Jesus being the created Son of God was not perfect by perfect I mean complete remember there's two Greek words used in the New Testament we use the one English word perfect but it means two different things one word is sinlessness and the other word is lack that which is to be completed so he was here on the earth totally sinless but he laid aside the completion of himself and he's going to regain it not by creation so whenever he gets back into that imorph body he will not speak himself back into Perfection of character so he lays aside that character before he comes down to the Earth and when he arrives he arrives like us lacking things in his character so how will he get them back now remember if he's going to be the diamond that come from God and chips of himself is going to come off and get in you however God gives him his character is how God is obligated to give you yours is that right so what does he do he allows his own character to be molded by the things he went through so he had to step out of this being of completion and Perfection and lacking nothing to having a character which needed to be worked on I remember Jesus never had a temper like us Jesus never you know said words that he shouldn't say or nothing like that but it was that element of character molding that can only come through the instrumentality of human beings human beings can be some of the greatest of God's creation and other times they can be sorry rotten dirt bags boy I didn't get very many amens on that and yet what was it that God used to mold the very character of the Lord Jesus donkeys cattle sheep giraffes horses elephants flies fleas gnats bees what was it people people people not good people now generally the people that are used to mold our character a lot of them will never even be saved anyway right they won't even be saved no they won't as a matter of fact you'll judge them in the day of judgment because a lot of them will never embrace your God and your truth but yet they are are on the negative side on the side of darkness and they will gou you and get at you and it just seem like they're not happy if they're not causing you trouble how many knows what I'm talking about you go anybody like that you work with or works for you or your mom or your daddy I mean and there's something about it that it just really irks us as we say and all that people and they can just so affect you you're having such a great day and you get a text from Mr irksome himself or Miss irksome and it just almost sends a chill up and down your spine and they just really rub you the wrong way you you I I would to God God would send lightning down out of heaven and and absolutely ackowledge them no you don't say them things you're too Angelic you think them yeah and yet God himself may have been the very one that allowed you to come in contact contact with that person and let them cross your path because those others who are so nice to you and so wonderful they never bother you they never bring any of those you know those weak things out of your character but it's those other type of people that do and when they do it really shows what we are now I'm sure this is probably not hardly for anybody that's here present today it's only for the streamers Erica honey this this is for you you need to straighten up some of you sorry people over in Norway that's streaming us right now would you bunch of Sinners get right with God some of you people in Johannesburg you Brothers over in Greenland you folks in Iceland you folks in Germany I wonder to God you people would get right with God so I could preach where all these Holy Angels Live I am preaching where you live right that's why you're quieter than a mouse this morning you might as well go ahead and loosen up cuz you ain't going to shut me down you ain't going to freeze me out and God allows things like that to come toward us and if we're not careful we'll become so discouraged by looking at the past in between the time we're in and out of the furnace and things that are going on to tr that we will lose scope of what it's all about it's for our good traumas that seem like will bring us to our knees time and time again and we wonder why why should this happen to me a as a child of God I'm a member of the Bride I believe this message with all of my heart reread what Peter said think it not strange beloved that some of these things will come upon you to try you as though some strange thing this is not strange at all as a matter of fact if you've got the Holy Ghost and the devil ain't trying you I question your Holy Ghost because if you've got not the Holy Ghost every devil in hell hates you when you get saved and filled with the Holy Ghost it's like God puts a great big Target on your back about that big and all of a sudden you walk out of The Honky Tonk you walk out of the world you walk out of the darkness of the light that you've been living in and the spirit of God fills you with the Holy Ghost and you're so happy but you didn't realize at the same time the Holy Ghost fell on your soul and God put a seal on your soul he put a great big old red target about that big on your back and you're thinking what in the world went wrong there ain't nothing wrong there ain't nothing out of cater you're doing exactly what you're supposed to do come on somebody and preach with me this morning I'll tell you what we're here for we are here to upset hell we are here to set the captive free we are here to make the devil mad and yes he will get mad but if you can't take it then get out of the way but if you're ordained of God I I say that we rise out of the high sheat that some of us are in today and let's dust off our clothes out of the ashes and say all right devil I put up with your lip long enough I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God yes I'm being tried yes I'm being tested and yes I will overcome because he sees in me a seed of his own making I am a chip off of the old Diamond Hallelujah I am am bride I am elect and you can't stop [Applause] me or you can come in and sit down and reckon why he's going to preach today I don't know but he'll be skinned as Shore as a world reckon he don't get tired of whooping on people what if you want me to preach her live [Applause] her she come I shall not be I shall not be moved by the song leader or the preacher or the teacher too just like a tree that's planted By the Waters I'm sitting in this Pew or chair and I shall not be moved Oh Glory to God and the devil's got you right where he wants you cuz you sat there and look around and the next thing you know church is done gone and what have you contribute what have you done what have you give do you realize friend every one of us are going to stand before God every service that we participate in around the world no matter where they are we're going to stand before God what are we going to give an account for to the Lord that day or is he going to say why did you even go to church why did you go you never clapped your hands you never raised your hands you never even lifted your voice but yet didn't I see you at the ball game with your granddaughter oh Jesus I better get back here at of rain Rock thr distance when you down there at that soccer field was that not you my daughter going she got it she got it she got what kicked a stupid bow [Music] and you scream like the world's on fire and God saved your soul and you set in church oh my so I tell what I want you to do for the next 6 months I want you to reverse roles so the next football game you go to base soccer whatever it is I want you to change and say now this is the way I act in church so this is the what I'm going to do when my grandson hits a home run and the grandson knocks it Plum out of the park and you said her like you're doing church at me and your grandson goes to first second home and there he is and he's looking at you grandma Grandma Grandpa and you're say nice nice well Glory now what do you think you're grandson's going to sing he going to come up to your grandma grandpa how come you w standing up how come you would what didn't you say I I I won that gang Grandma I won that game I I did a home run I've never done before I don't know that that's nice honey reck what he was going to do said Mama what what Happ to Grandma she act like she didn't love me a so if you don't use your emotions to react is that a sign that you don't love whoever it is you're talking about wo Glory thank you here comes old Fritz let me share this with you I know my redeemer live if we were put here for a purpose then there is nothing say it with me there is nothing nothing can destroy us until God's purpose is fulfilled nothing nothing can harm us until that purpose that God has put us here for has been made manifest oh brother Donnie it's getting so dark it's getting so bad I'm afraid the whole bride's going to be lost you need to listen to this sermon again and again and again then you need to listen to the sister sermon of this preached two years later one of them is called I know my redeemer Liv us and the other one is called I know and you'll get so energized if you got the holy ghost coming out that that you realize there ain't enough devils in hell to stop the purpose of God nobody's going to stop this bride from being who Jesus wants her to be why because he cut up himself and gave you and you and you and you a portion of that diamond and he's molding and cutting and shaping us to we can be what he wants us to be and when he gets all the diamonds cut around the world he will call for his jewels to come home Hallelujah then he will gather us all no matter how much trouble we have how much heartaches and Sorrows we go through all these are reasons and there's a reason for it do we understand his reasons of course of course we don't but we trust him God's purpose can never how many believes it never be defeated there is nothing can defeat it so how sad and how depressed and how longf faced how what happy we'll let your face know it would you how happy ought we to be today resting upon that beautiful Revelation but you see friends the reason a lot of us aren't happy is because this is not revealed to us it's just a beautiful quote not a beautiful Revelation if God reveals this to us us I don't care what we Face we know there is a peace in the middle of storms there's a great joy in the midst of Trials oh that's right notice I love this he said what God has imagined in his mind what God has purposed in his heart now imagined it in his mind purposed it in his heart to bring to pass there is no demon there's no power there is nothing can ever separate God's Great Immortal Eternal plan it must be as God has said hallelujah hallelujah and the church said it is a purpose of God listen to this now to to give us the Blessed Holy Spirit it is a purpose of God to show us signs and wonders and and miracles well Glory I realize a lot of the folks in the message don't want that no more but I personally believe we're in need of these more than we've ever been we've got sick folk everywhere we've got folks that the doctors are saying we don't know what to do to help you I believe the supernatural God wants to manifest himself anybody in here with me today why because any where God is there is Supernatural taking place let people call us Pentecostal let them call us whatever they want to call us you call me that if you wish to but when the Rapture comes call me gone cuz I ain't going to be here how can I say days of Miracles is passed when every person here today that's saved is a miracle every person here today that has the Holy Ghost is a miracle you're sitting here today by the grace of God because you're one Miracle after another after another God desires to display himself and no Satan cannot stop [Applause] it let me read this again is it a purpose of God to give us the Blessed Holy Spirit it is a purpose of God to show us signs and wonders and miracles it is a purpose of God and nothing you hear me I don't care hot cold and indifference some of the message people get it ain't going to stop the bride all the message people ain't bride no way I know it hurts your feeling to acknowledge that but you might as well Prophet tells us a power transformation every Revival produces a set of twins and we've got one too they look like us they even talk like us somewhat but the difference is they got different daddies our father is the word we don't cut and splice and take out what quotes we want what quotes we don't want we lay them aside we don't cut imply scriptures we believe every word God said Hallelujah let me tell you what's against you all powers of Hell might wager against it but it will prevail you understand down through time God in his sovereignty would not let every demon do his full capability not only have the seals come open in this day but the Gates of Hell have opened themselves hell has enlarged her mouth and the gates of hell are open and after everyone come on children don't you understand why so many of the churches are compromising on the day we're living in and joining up with the homosexual agenda the trans transgender agenda don't you understand why that is the sodomites are knocking on lot's door and lot is letting them in well come on now I said the sodomites are knocking on lot's door and lot is letting them in Oh Brother Donnie wouldn't you allow somebody like that to come to our church yep you can sure come that way but we want you to come that way but not leave the way you came if the power of God is here he can deliver you from that evil thing because he is the same yesterday today and [Applause] forever oh my received a text yesterday from one of the brothers of our church who had taken his wife away in their anniversary he sent me a picture of a church in this large city and they had a sign on the outside everybody welcome of course they had the rainbow sign and you know what all that sort of thing and they said they've been walking around this great city in America and seeing one church after another flying their Flags what is it Sodom invading lot but you don't find Abraham flying a transgender flag you don't find Abraham flying a sixcol rainbow flag come on somebody you don't find Abraham over there calling him pervert Brothers but whenever them perverted bunch of people knocked on lot's doors lot said do not so wickedly my brethren calling sodomites his brothers look at his daughters where did they see that sexual perversion of getting their father drunk and committing incest with their father yeah sure never learned that in Abraham's tent now come on don't get quiet on me theyve done seen your face on camera anyway you might as well say Amen they know you come here they probably drive by and seen your car sitting out there so you might as well go ahead and say Amen you're identified I'm glad to be identified with an oldfashioned Gospel of Jesus Christ which sets the captive free and delivers people of such evil spirits Glory there may be teachers there may be isms rise there may be grow great programs rise there may be things that look like that it would be destroyed but it can never be destroyed it is the purpose of God to see that it will prevail praise be to God you know Iran I feel sorry for them you know Iran used to be Persia and they were a great Empire at one time but they've got this thing about Israel they absolutely hate him and they're going to destroy them as a matter of fact nasala the main guy of Hezbollah and some of the other Terror programs said just last week we will blow Israel back to the Stone Age and I read that I thought NOP I'll tell you who is going to take them back to the Stone Age though it'll be the Lord Jesus that stone that was cut out of the mountain the Stone Age is coming Oh Glory to God oh my Putin has got his big bomb called the tar the largest nuclear manmade weapon of course it's ever been designed and it's horrific the amount of Devastation and destruction that they say that it can accomplished but every Born Again child of God sting here today you can lay down on your bed tonight and not worry about nuclear fallout you don't have to worry about Putin you don't have to worry about Russia or Iran or irq or your neighbor because God is the only one who can oh Hallelujah complete what he's ordained Satan cannot stop it Israel is totally surrounded like you are got the Mediterranean over here Egypt down here they got Lebanon they got Iran good Way's over everywhere around them they got enemies everywhere and every one of them out to get them and then poor old dumb Palestinians living right next door wanting them to bomb them with the atomic bomb you say duh so where do y'all figure you going to go that that nuclear fall that would make it unlivable uninhabitable they say for 150 years so you're wanting them to bomb you and you know what divide section A B and C you don't what ab and C is no probably not well they divided Israel so they got a section A a section b a section c when we was there a few years ago and going into Bethlehem that is under Palestinian control so you've got a little town of Bethlehem how still we see the lie and you see a mined over here and a mined over there which is the sign of Islam you go down through and there's section A and section B our guide could not even go into Bethlehem because he was a Jew his homeland how could it be because they compromised on God's word years ago and now the enemy's got their land is that what we want we want the enemy to have our peace we want the enemy to have our joy and stick up his minettes here and there I say it's time we tear them down Hallelujah and say Satan you're not building your Memorial on my ground get out so you imagine here's a Jew he's not even allowed to go into Bethlehem the Galilee you understand what they're calling the occupied West Bank you know where that is Galilee and Samaria and they're called in Israel the occupiers that's why they hate it when they dig out stuff out of the ground and they find Israel's Heritage laying buried down in the dirt so they find this King and they find this sign that I read you one six or seven months ago when they had dug down to the streets of Jerusalem just three months ago three and a half months ago they uncovered the original pool of salom the Bible says they would go up to Jerusalem and they knew there had to be an Ascent somewhere they have just found just recently the original steps that went from salom up to the Temple Mount and they found Rings down inside there they found a stamp on the other side in the city of David and it was of one of the scribes in the book of Jeremiah of course the Palestinians don't like that because that tells them they was there before they were there that's the way the devil wants to tell you you don't belong to God you belong to me but God digs and digs and digs and goes past this and that and the other and God wants you to see your seed Hallelujah God wants you to see who you are if he can have a minister that'll dig past all your complexes all your fears all your anxiety and say here child here say who you are say who you belong to you don't belong to the world you don't belong to the devil You Belong To Me Hallelujah it can never be destroyed it is the purpose of God to see that it will prevail then it's not up to me or it's not up to you whether it will be destroyed or not it's up to God oh yeah we're going to do our part but it's not me that'll make this work it it ain't you God will do it we can rest assured on it listen this God will never let our heritage be destroyed can you imagine what an awesome thing it must have been about nine months ago when they're in the city of ancient Shiloh or Shilo of Hebrew we've stood there Carol and I we saw them digging up a Roman Capital actually while we were there Capital the top goes on a post theya back to Caligula's time and they found a place where all these bones and skeletons of animals were and then they found steps and they found a place where water had been and the man said the way it was centered on Shilo it was the place where the holiest of holies would have been in the Tabernacle hundreds of remnants of Bones what was it speaking of their Heritage I don't care what the president of France says I don't care what the Italian prime minister says I don't care what trau from Canada says that land belongs to Israel like it or lump it God gave it to them and the left is not going to change it I don't care what the devil says I don't care what your friends say I don't care what your mama says or what your daddy says if what they say is contrary to God's word if God laid that Heritage of the sea life inside of you there ain't nobody going to stop you oh brother Donnie I I've got such a bad habit I can't get rid of it drinking can't stop you pornography can't stop you anxiety can't stop you oh Hallelujah there is nothing going to stop you because God laids your heritage in you before the foundation of the world and nothing's going to stop you it's your heritage it's my heritage to be a Son of God it's my Heritage to give birth it's our heritage as a church to give birth to our young people not just let them be members of our assembly but pray with them to they're so full of the Holy Ghost they turn hell upside down hallelujah hallelujah let me close God will never let our heritage be destroyed for it's his purpose to give it to us but brother Donnie the scientists say and and and the great theologians say and the great teachers say uhhuh I hear you you see the great theologians even Bible study and theologians said that Pontius Pilate never lived cuz they couldn't find no history but several years ago in cesaria whenever they was out there digging around I like to dig don't you they sat there digging around here and they found this Roman Coliseum beautiful place right on the right on the seaside awesome place and they had this long stretches of sand where they would race and they had the the Roman circus and all their hell right there and they got over after looking around at the Coliseum and somebody happened to get down on their knees that might be a good place to start and you was all these solid Stone steps and somebody was down on their knees kind of digging around and they happened to look up and when they looked up there was a stone that had been carved in that Coliseum that had been there for 2,000 years dedicated in the memory of ponches [Applause] pilot once again God's word is proven true let me tell you something I don't need a rock in a Coliseum to you I don't need them to find a COI pot over here and a pot over there I have the mind of Christ and with the mind of Christ he projects to us as his children something more sure than a rock it's a revelation of his word you're talking about Grace listen to this next quote no matter how indifferent we seem to be at times and how strange things go and how the church gets in this condition and that condition it's all in the Divine Purpose of God to mold us and make us in his own way who knows how to Fashion the material more than the Creator can I share one more with you it just goes to show that nothing can defeat his purpose not even death can defeat his purpose Abraham was as good as dead and Sarah's womb had been dead for 40 or 50 years but nothing can defeat God's purpose her body was old it was wrinkled the milk veins are dry up her heart was so weak it could not have went through labor but God let us know that his purpose will not be defeated he changed Sarah and made her a young woman again and took a man 100 years old and turned him back to his use no matter how unreasonable it may seem God gave the promise and Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving God praise praise for he judged him that he was able to perform what he had promised and the church said amen do you judge him faithful he promised a Rapture will there be you believe you're a part of it he promised there'll be a people around the world will there be yes well the dead in Christ rise will you see your loved ones will we be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we judge him faithful praise God praise God let's
