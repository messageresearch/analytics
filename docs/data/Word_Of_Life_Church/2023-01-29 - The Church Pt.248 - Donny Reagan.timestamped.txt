[17:32] songs over and over and I know more
[17:34] songs but sometimes just something to
[17:36] settle in and the purpose of this song
[17:38] Today is specific
[17:42] the prophet when he spoke the words
[17:44] Behold The Virgin shall conceive it came
[17:47] out of inspiration from God
[17:50] and we know that those words circled the
[17:52] Earth for hundreds of years until it
[17:55] found a little heart to settle in
[17:58] and the words to this song was birthed
[18:00] out of inspiration from the same God who
[18:02] spoke to Isaiah
[18:04] a song
[18:06] something keeps holding me
[18:08] and I want to sing it today for a
[18:10] specific reason being that the words to
[18:13] this song being that they are inspired
[18:16] I want the words to this song to Circle
[18:19] in this building
[18:22] this place
[18:24] because who knows who they will settle
[18:26] in and change their very heart change a
[18:28] very life
[18:29] so you all pray with me sing with me
[18:31] create that atmosphere that will be
[18:34] something that will change a life maybe
[18:36] next week maybe today maybe a month from

[36:54] what greater honor could there be
[36:57] to be called by God to be a part of his
[37:00] body
[37:01] to represent him in the Earth
[37:06] well anybody here going to be crying
[37:07] after today
[37:11] probably not
[37:14] I think the Lord had been able to have
[37:16] this place
[37:17] I'm glad we're moving on aren't you
[37:21] second Corinthians chapter 10.
[37:24] for
[37:28] I certainly appreciate all the musicians
[37:30] and all the brothers that have helped
[37:32] them have to move all this stuff back
[37:34] and forth and back and forth yeah so
[37:38] many of the services they'll be moving
[37:40] at all again again today
[37:42] we certainly appreciate all the effort
[37:44] that they've put forth
[37:47] second Corinthians chapter 10 verse 4.
[37:52] for the weapons of our Warfare not
[37:54] carnal
[37:56] But Mighty through God to the pulling
[37:58] down of strongholds
[38:01] casting down imaginations which is part
[38:04] of our spirit of course
[38:06] and every High thing that exalteth
[38:09] itself against the knowledge of God
[38:12] and bringing into captivity
[38:15] every thought
[38:18] wow
[38:19] I wonder how many of us could say we did
[38:21] that
[38:24] you see my hand ain't no bigger
[38:27] bringing into captivity Every Soul I
[38:31] realize there's an element of people
[38:32] around the message that say and preach
[38:34] preachers that we are beyond the Bible
[38:38] actually
[38:39] and that Paul and Peter and all of those
[38:42] brothers were just immature infants
[38:46] and that we're so far beyond them do I
[38:49] look at it if I can just get to where
[38:51] they were I'll be doing pretty good yeah
[38:54] so for those of you that are beyond the
[38:56] Bible pray for us it's still working on
[38:58] it would you
[39:00] notice what Paul said bringing into
[39:02] captivity
[39:04] every thought
[39:07] to The Obedience of Christ
[39:10] Philippians 4
[39:12] verse 8. Philippians chapter 4 verse 8.
[39:17] finally brethren
[39:19] whatsoever things are true whatsoever
[39:22] things are honest
[39:24] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[39:27] things are pure
[39:28] whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever
[39:31] things are of a good report
[39:34] if there be any virtue
[39:36] if there be any praise
[39:39] think
[39:41] on these things
[39:43] well it wouldn't be a be a happier
[39:45] people if we did that
[39:48] I mean lots of you remembers we pray
[39:49] today
[39:52] heavenly father is we bow our heads to
[39:55] the dust of the Earth from once our
[39:57] bodies were taken
[39:59] and we know unless we're changed they'll
[40:01] go back that way
[40:03] but father we know the important thing
[40:06] is that we take what life that you've
[40:09] given us and we invested into the
[40:12] kingdom of God we allow you to use this
[40:15] for your Divine Purpose or that small
[40:18] medium or large that doesn't really
[40:20] matter to us
[40:22] what we want is for you to be pleased
[40:24] with us
[40:26] Lord God as we approach your word today
[40:28] I pray that you'd help me
[40:30] help me that I can
[40:31] step aside Lord and may you be able to
[40:34] speak through this human vessel
[40:37] something that would benefit your people
[40:39] not only those in the visible audience
[40:41] but those invisible as well
[40:43] we want to say thank you Father that
[40:46] we've been able to have this place where
[40:48] we can meet for the last few months
[40:50] we're grateful for it
[40:52] Lord God we're believing you that when
[40:54] we move into the new place that it's
[40:56] going to be just phenomenal it'll be
[40:59] above what we could even ask or think
[41:02] what you're going to do Among Us
[41:04] not so much because of the new building
[41:06] but we know every time you moved the
[41:09] people of Israel from one place to
[41:11] another it was climbing higher and
[41:13] higher that's what we want we're not so
[41:16] much interested in a nice new building a
[41:18] nice this nice that what we want is your
[41:21] presence
[41:22] whether it's in a Shack by the side of
[41:24] the road or a nice building that's what
[41:26] we desire
[41:27] speak to us today Father by Your Word we
[41:30] ask in Jesus name
[41:32] amen God bless you may be seated
[41:34] certainly not to
[41:36] agree to each other here today visitors
[41:38] that are with us
[41:40] and the Lord
[41:41] be with you and bless you
[41:45] imagine there was one thing that Rahab
[41:49] tomorrow
[41:52] ruse
[41:54] Bathsheba
[41:55] all of them had at least one thing in
[41:58] common
[42:00] they all had to look past them
[42:03] the negativity of their lives
[42:06] all four of them like most of us
[42:10] have had enough
[42:11] negative things in our life
[42:14] and it certainly affects us
[42:17] we know that we are a supernatural being
[42:20] but I think most of us also realize that
[42:24] we are a natural one as well
[42:27] and my natural one is the one that gets
[42:30] me in most of my trouble
[42:32] it's not my soul it loves God just
[42:35] harmonizes with his word since I've been
[42:37] born again but it's our flesh and yet we
[42:41] know that not only our flesh part but
[42:44] our spirit part as well
[42:47] as a matter of fact it can be one of our
[42:49] greatest enemies the body itself
[42:53] actually is neutral you take the spirit
[42:57] of God and put it inside of a human body
[42:59] it can affect that neutrality of the
[43:02] body to where the body becomes obedient
[43:04] to what the word says
[43:06] Spirit of the world which we're born
[43:08] with it affects the neutrality of the
[43:12] body makes the body lie makes the body
[43:14] drink makes the body get addicted to
[43:17] drugs habits things like that because
[43:19] the body itself is very neutral it must
[43:23] have an influence it must have a power
[43:25] that affects it and the spirit is not so
[43:29] much neutral but it is a nature of
[43:33] something that is innocent that nature
[43:36] is what affects what we become
[43:39] our human spirit is very complicated
[43:41] it's a very complex thing none of us
[43:44] have ever actually thought or felt or
[43:48] experienced what Adam did in the
[43:51] beginning because Adam had nothing
[43:54] negative to affect him so there was no
[43:57] trauma there was no fear there was no
[44:00] anxiety of course to life to the fall he
[44:03] felt everything in Perfection love
[44:07] genuine truths no betrayal nothing ever
[44:11] bad in any way so we've never felt that
[44:14] really most of us whether you're 15 or
[44:17] 45 or 65 or 85 most of us have had fear
[44:23] trauma anxiety disappointment betrayal
[44:27] by Friends by Family by all different
[44:30] types of things and I know we we sing
[44:32] that that doesn't affect us as
[44:34] Christians and we thought well we're so
[44:36] far beyond that but you really know
[44:39] you see what you are in that human
[44:42] element it's where the great battle
[44:44] actually comes from and the imagination
[44:47] the affection the memory the conscience
[44:51] the things that's inside the human
[44:53] spirit is much of what dictates a lot of
[44:57] the battles that we Face a lot of the
[44:59] scars that are brought Upon Us
[45:01] self-inflicted many of them are brought
[45:03] on by others of course but let me just
[45:07] before I go into this from a
[45:09] psychological aspect if that's all right
[45:12] let me bring it to you from the realm of
[45:15] your human Spirit now in that it has
[45:18] five inlets or five channels imagination
[45:21] conscience memory reason and affection
[45:24] and that's the way that we're able to
[45:27] contact our ocean home so you can
[45:30] imagine then what this body would be if
[45:34] we didn't have any memory if we had no
[45:37] imagination if man and had no
[45:41] imagination we wouldn't have this type
[45:43] of building today there would be no such
[45:45] a thing as a wireless microphone but
[45:49] somebody imagined there would be a way
[45:52] that a speaker would be able to stand up
[45:54] and speak to an audience and he wouldn't
[45:57] have to have a cable drug around behind
[46:00] him all the time and somebody began to
[46:02] think well what about Wi-Fi what about
[46:06] cell phones now that's still up for
[46:08] debate whether we're better with them or
[46:10] without them I guess right but it was
[46:13] the imagination of someone Alexander
[46:16] Graham Bell that began to think about
[46:18] there must be a way that we could
[46:20] contact one another Thomas Edison of
[46:23] course went through many many failures
[46:26] before he was able to go through many of
[46:28] the successful inventions that the man
[46:31] did where did that come from not from
[46:33] his soul that did not come from his
[46:37] memory that did not come from a
[46:39] affection where'd it come from
[46:41] imagination an imagination is a great
[46:45] thing as long as it's used in the right
[46:48] way but imagination can be so
[46:51] destructive to each of us
[46:55] my imagination now I don't mind telling
[46:58] you I've got quite a quite an
[46:59] imagination so my imagination can be
[47:03] very destructive and can be used against
[47:07] me a lot of times now maybe some of you
[47:10] say well that don't bother me well just
[47:12] listen to me before you make that
[47:14] assumption because as we can imagine
[47:17] positive things we can also Imagine
[47:21] negative things and there is a power
[47:25] that is released from us because we are
[47:29] a supernatural being so as our
[47:32] imagination can be able to take things
[47:34] and Tinker together and make this and
[47:37] put that together uh you know that's a
[47:40] powerful thing but as our imagination
[47:43] can also begin to take things that are
[47:46] not factual or realistic our imagination
[47:50] can turn it into something that is so
[47:53] real to us but is actually alive
[47:58] watch this the prophet says it this way
[48:01] you just imagine that somebody hates you
[48:04] once
[48:06] now this is all you have to imagine it
[48:08] once
[48:09] somebody hates you once now he said they
[48:14] don't hate you but you imagine that they
[48:18] do
[48:19] and you just keep thinking now remember
[48:23] you don't think with your soul
[48:26] you don't think these types of thoughts
[48:29] from your soul negative sinking from a
[48:31] born-again person cannot exist they
[48:34] think positive on the word so you're
[48:37] thinking with your spirit now remember
[48:40] he says but you imagine they do and you
[48:43] just keep thinking they don't like me
[48:48] they don't like me is there anybody here
[48:51] that's ever been that way one two three
[48:54] oh okay all right okay so you begin to
[48:58] think now now where does it start in the
[49:01] channel of imagination now you just
[49:03] imagine that you bumped into brother Rob
[49:06] out there in the four year before
[49:07] service and and brother Rob was thinking
[49:10] about speaking to someone else and he's
[49:12] a man on a mission and he's got to go
[49:13] talk to somebody and you bound hey
[49:15] Adrian brother Robin he just you know
[49:17] went right on it wasn't trying to be
[49:19] mean to you or nothing like that that's
[49:21] not brother Rob's away but yet in your
[49:23] mind you think he doesn't like me
[49:26] now say you're going to try them out to
[49:28] service and he's again a man on a
[49:30] mission and here he's going wide open to
[49:32] do this or that or the other and you're
[49:33] just thinking that's twice in the same
[49:36] service he does not like me brother Rob
[49:40] let's just settle this is there anyone
[49:41] near the building you don't like
[49:43] see there you go
[49:50] so the situation is resolved right
[49:54] but the problem of it is most of us
[49:56] don't get to hear that from the person
[49:58] that we think has a problem with us
[50:01] so we begin to take this into this
[50:04] Avenue of our imagination and then we
[50:07] begin to think about it think about it
[50:10] and we imagine they don't like us now
[50:13] notice what that changes into now the
[50:16] prophet said the first thing you'll be
[50:17] doing is shining that person so now it
[50:22] moves Beyond just imagination something
[50:26] is actually struck in your brain now
[50:29] whether or not you understand this from
[50:32] your brain in the vortex of your brain
[50:35] also from the part called the amygdala
[50:38] that in this almond-shaped mass of gray
[50:42] matter
[50:43] whenever you have positive or negative
[50:46] thoughts it Associates in your brain and
[50:51] releases hormones in your body every
[50:54] thought positive or negative releases
[50:58] this chemistry that takes place in your
[51:01] body which will go to reacting upon your
[51:05] emotions then you think about it you
[51:09] think about it whether positive or
[51:11] negative and you think about it brother
[51:14] Rob don't like me now he's done told you
[51:16] that he does okay but you think he don't
[51:19] he don't and all of a sudden you begin
[51:22] to feel something in your body reacting
[51:27] what is it it's your emotions and it's
[51:30] being released from this part of your
[51:33] brain and it's causing a feeling to come
[51:36] through you say I know it I know it
[51:38] don't cause I feel it
[51:44] now are you yes are you actually feeling
[51:48] something you are but it's based on a
[51:53] lie
[51:56] come on I've been there and done that
[51:59] now what's the first saying that you'll
[52:01] begin shunning that person when they
[52:04] haven't done nothing to you after a
[52:07] while it will become such a reality to
[52:10] you to you actually believe that person
[52:15] doesn't like it now what's taking place
[52:17] from this Avenue of your spirit of
[52:20] imagination you're beginning to create a
[52:24] situation what is nothing but a lie but
[52:28] it is not a lie to you because you've
[52:31] got more than one witness you've got it
[52:34] in your imagination you've got it in
[52:36] your thinking your brain has now
[52:39] released a hormone that is associated
[52:41] with this negative thought and then when
[52:44] you think about brother Rob or whoever
[52:46] else that it would be this feeling comes
[52:49] over you and you begin to call their
[52:52] name and you say now he he don't like me
[52:55] he don't like me and yet my daughter
[52:57] goes to the youth service and how am I
[52:59] going to treat him the next time that I
[53:02] see him or I'm going to go ahead and
[53:03] tell you how you're going to treat him
[53:04] you're going to treat him with an
[53:06] attitude and you're going to treat him
[53:08] as if though he's done something wrong
[53:09] when in reality he hasn't done one thing
[53:12] at all but it's all in your imagination
[53:17] well praise the Lord
[53:19] this will be the start of a new series
[53:22] wouldn't it my my now once it becomes
[53:26] such a reality the prophet said to you
[53:29] that you actually believe the person
[53:32] doesn't like it now there's no facts
[53:34] there's no proof but you have this in
[53:37] your imagination and then you have these
[53:39] thoughts and you feel it it's just real
[53:42] so the next time you say well maybe I'm
[53:43] wrong maybe I'm wrong and maybe if
[53:45] there's perhaps that I misunderstood but
[53:47] Rob maybe that brother it wasn't that
[53:49] Islamic but he's just as brother the
[53:51] only saves a man on a mission he's a guy
[53:52] you know he's got all these things that
[53:54] he's doing but I'm going to try it again
[53:56] I'm going to try again well the next
[53:57] time you see brother rob you know
[53:59] somebody just text him on the phone
[54:00] brother Rob we haven't used service
[54:01] when's the next one I'm so sick because
[54:03] Wayne had no use cells I'm all upset and
[54:05] brother Robin says oh I'm so sorry oh
[54:07] it's my fault we should had another
[54:08] youth service I'm so sorry and just so
[54:10] happens he walks right by you
[54:16] and then all of a sudden your brain
[54:18] associated with this thought releases
[54:21] this hormone again and you feel this
[54:24] anybody ever felt a flushing or a
[54:27] sensation in your body when a certain
[54:29] thing is mentioned or a certain person
[54:31] is mentioned
[54:33] wow
[54:34] my goodness so you all aren't as
[54:37] spiritual as you thought you were are
[54:39] you
[54:40] you see you're not only Supernatural but
[54:43] you're very very natural
[54:46] now watch he said you might ball them
[54:50] out wow you might bawl them out or say
[54:55] something to them now he said it
[54:59] for instance it's your wife
[55:02] or your husband
[55:04] nobody that's married please move
[55:07] don't bat an eye don't smile don't
[55:09] friends just look our mediocre you know
[55:12] she's watching you Brothers I'm telling
[55:14] you she's
[55:17] or some neighbor or something like that
[55:20] and the person is absolutely innocent
[55:24] of any ill saying but it's because that
[55:29] you just imagine that it's so till it
[55:33] become a reality
[55:37] to you you mean we have the ability as
[55:40] human beings
[55:42] to create
[55:44] and form something from nothing
[55:49] and it is so real to us our senses tell
[55:53] us it's real
[55:54] the hormones in our brain tell us it's
[55:57] real
[55:58] at our imagination it tells us it's real
[56:03] and that person could say brother they
[56:06] notice you you know kind of a boy and
[56:07] brother if I did anything to you no
[56:12] no
[56:16] that's a big one right there
[56:20] now you think
[56:22] so we can all be that easily deceived
[56:28] by ourselves
[56:31] he said that wasn't the devil Paul devil
[56:33] bless his soul I mean hell he gets
[56:36] blamed for so much stuff he ain't guilty
[56:38] of
[56:39] at least take the blame for what you do
[56:41] he's going to burn long enough of what
[56:43] he's done the least be man or woman
[56:45] enough to just admit what you've done
[56:47] yourself a lot of the things that we
[56:49] deal with in life are self-inflicted
[56:51] though we blame everybody else for us
[56:55] now once he said it's because you just
[56:58] imagine it so till it become a reality
[57:02] to you now watch how that the psyche of
[57:07] the human being is made up so not just
[57:11] now of even Christians the prophet of
[57:14] the Messiah says this here the other
[57:16] night I saw on a telecast of a man with
[57:20] psychic mental Faith he sat a glass of
[57:24] water and stood back and kept
[57:27] concentrating on that glass of water
[57:29] till it bursted
[57:32] so you're a man that's not a Christian
[57:34] he's not a Believer but he sets a glass
[57:37] of water in a spot and he sits there and
[57:40] concentrates concentrates concentrates
[57:43] until he bursts the glass with his
[57:47] psychic power
[57:49] and he said the glass cracked and the
[57:52] water run out just pure mental
[57:56] concentration that's his fibers that's
[57:59] his makeup now he's got a power given to
[58:03] him by mental thinking that can break a
[58:06] glass of water him being a sinner
[58:09] so that shows that there's something
[58:12] that way in a man I said that's a fallen
[58:15] man how much more if man could only get
[58:18] back to God and let God take that turn
[58:21] that loose in the kingdom of God praise
[58:24] the Lord
[58:25] so can you imagine then if a person
[58:27] that's not a Believer would be able to
[58:29] concentrate now this is plastic so I
[58:32] don't figure we can break it but if we
[58:34] would be able to sit there and
[58:35] concentrate and concentrate on that if
[58:38] it were glass enough to be able to
[58:40] project our psychic mental powers to
[58:43] that to word that somehow by frequency
[58:45] vibration however it works it would
[58:47] actually burst that vessel and cause the
[58:50] liquid to spill out I wonder if we could
[58:53] ever Focus that by the spirit of God if
[58:56] we wouldn't be able to take an attitude
[58:59] or an Avenue of people that don't like
[59:01] us don't care for us or whatever instead
[59:04] of breaking a glass wonder if we could
[59:06] break bondage
[59:08] wonder if we couldn't break a hard
[59:11] feeling or something between you and a
[59:14] brother you and a family member or
[59:16] whatever more that by the spirit of God
[59:18] not psychic Faith but the spirit of God
[59:21] taking you as a son or daughter of God
[59:24] and you creating an atmosphere around
[59:27] that individual to let them know you do
[59:29] love them and you careful now I wonder
[59:32] if it wouldn't be a greater body of the
[59:35] Lord Jesus Christ
[59:36] now watch this so here we look at Elijah
[59:40] and we know that that brother random of
[59:42] course was a human being like all the
[59:44] rest of us and I I love this statement
[59:47] here because it shows us The Human Side
[59:49] imperfect Faith he said I get spells too
[59:53] you know I get moody anybody ever get
[59:57] into spells what we call spells anybody
[59:59] ever get moody
[1:00:00] all the rescue Angels were happy to have
[1:00:03] you all visiting with us today so I get
[1:00:06] I said I get to a spot what gets me is
[1:00:09] where I get into those spells that I get
[1:00:13] overworked and Satan comes telling me
[1:00:16] why nobody cares for you
[1:00:20] you really haven't got a friend
[1:00:25] in the world
[1:00:28] now remember this is
[1:00:31] 1963. the prophet has been preaching for
[1:00:34] many many years he's known by people
[1:00:37] around the world hundreds of thousands
[1:00:40] of people have been affected by his
[1:00:42] ministry
[1:00:44] wonder why that did not drive this away
[1:00:47] from him
[1:00:48] wonder why Satan was able to tell him
[1:00:52] this and it actually bothered him enough
[1:00:55] that he would believe it
[1:01:00] wow so you mean having friends and
[1:01:04] having acquaintances and even a lot of
[1:01:07] friends there might be thousands of
[1:01:09] people that are your friends on Facebook
[1:01:11] that don't mean they're your real
[1:01:13] friends
[1:01:14] you may have folks that you go to church
[1:01:16] with that you consider your friends but
[1:01:18] it doesn't mean they're really really
[1:01:19] truly your friend you understand what
[1:01:21] I'm saying but apparently there was
[1:01:24] enough truth to this that it really
[1:01:27] bothered him you know Satan wouldn't
[1:01:29] waste his time telling you something
[1:01:31] that wouldn't have some sort of effect
[1:01:33] on you how many knows that's right now
[1:01:36] he said so Satan would tell him nobody
[1:01:38] cares for you you really haven't got a
[1:01:41] friend now notice he didn't say a
[1:01:44] million or a hundred thousand or ten
[1:01:47] thousand but Satan told him you really
[1:01:50] haven't got a one
[1:01:52] you really haven't got one friend how in
[1:01:55] the world is that possible that that
[1:01:58] could actually be a believable
[1:02:00] temptation to the prophet of God well
[1:02:03] most of the people that come to him
[1:02:05] wanted something they wanted prayer they
[1:02:08] wanted answers to this that the other
[1:02:10] they wanted something how many came to
[1:02:13] him that didn't want anything that just
[1:02:15] really wanted to be a friend and a buddy
[1:02:17] and a pal you understand that so many of
[1:02:20] them they constantly wanted something so
[1:02:23] this was of a believable Temptation now
[1:02:27] once he said and remember I'm not immune
[1:02:30] to that Temptation I got to overcome
[1:02:33] that okay so if that was something he
[1:02:37] had to overcome I wonder about some of
[1:02:39] us here today
[1:02:41] nobody in the church loves you nobody
[1:02:44] likes you you know this one don't like
[1:02:46] you this one don't like you now for some
[1:02:49] that I that don't even bother me I don't
[1:02:51] even care well there's something wrong
[1:02:53] with you if you don't want to be loved
[1:02:55] then there's something missing in your
[1:02:57] life
[1:02:57] now let me go in this way in the Avenue
[1:03:00] of of Science and other clinical studies
[1:03:03] and I know some of it's going to freak
[1:03:05] out for a few minutes but just give me a
[1:03:07] few minutes before you shut me down
[1:03:09] clinical studies show that when we fill
[1:03:12] our minds with negative thoughts it may
[1:03:15] become easier to give in to feelings of
[1:03:19] helplessness and despair have you ever
[1:03:22] notice that when you get down and you
[1:03:24] get weary and the longer you think that
[1:03:27] way the lower you become and the more
[1:03:30] down you become
[1:03:32] well here's the reason why now remember
[1:03:34] what medical science has done has been
[1:03:36] able to break into the anatomy of the
[1:03:39] body and understand what makes us the
[1:03:41] way we are they always don't have the
[1:03:43] answer we know that but it's amazing how
[1:03:46] parallel they run and you just be
[1:03:48] patient with me and I'll bring you some
[1:03:50] quotes here that's exactly what they say
[1:03:52] these feelings can lead to unhealthy
[1:03:56] behavior that reinforce negative
[1:04:00] thinking patterns so it's like the more
[1:04:03] we think negative and the more we think
[1:04:06] nobody loves me nobody likes me then it
[1:04:09] leads to actually more negative thinking
[1:04:12] so you think well nobody loves now I'm
[1:04:14] not a part I'm not important you know if
[1:04:16] I don't come to church ain't no big deal
[1:04:18] nobody loves me and the more you think
[1:04:20] about it the more it's easier for you to
[1:04:23] think about it so the more you think
[1:04:25] about it the more you think about it and
[1:04:27] the more you think about it the more you
[1:04:29] think about it and the more you think
[1:04:31] about it the more real it becomes to you
[1:04:33] and your brain is releasing these
[1:04:36] hormones inside of your body then when
[1:04:38] you think about church you get this
[1:04:40] feeling that runs over you
[1:04:46] mom
[1:04:48] negative thinking can have a significant
[1:04:51] impact on our hormones and the body a
[1:04:54] report from the University of Minnesota
[1:04:57] examines how negative thoughts and
[1:05:00] feelings can activate the body's stress
[1:05:04] response
[1:05:06] so when we're thinking negative then
[1:05:09] here it's releasing the cortisol inside
[1:05:11] of our body and it triggers fight or
[1:05:15] flight so it triggers this inside of us
[1:05:18] stress triggers the release of cortisol
[1:05:22] and other hormones that can cause
[1:05:25] physical and emotional distress this
[1:05:29] Cascade of hormones increases
[1:05:32] inflammation in the body
[1:05:35] oh my goodness leading to a higher risk
[1:05:39] of developing illnesses such as heart
[1:05:42] disease all my and diabetes and yet we
[1:05:46] watch our cholesterol and we watch the
[1:05:48] amount of eggs we eat we don't like to
[1:05:50] worry about that today as high as they
[1:05:51] are doing we watch this and we watch
[1:05:54] that but I wonder do you understand much
[1:05:57] of our trouble no doubt is coming from
[1:05:59] who us
[1:06:01] our worries our anxieties all of these
[1:06:05] things we go through and we are
[1:06:07] releasing them from the factory inside
[1:06:10] of our own bodies the factory inside of
[1:06:14] our own bodies are releasing these
[1:06:17] negative things and that it causes us to
[1:06:20] get sick and other avenues of our life
[1:06:23] and who does the devil want to blame for
[1:06:25] it God of course what is God's fault God
[1:06:28] didn't keep it God never told you to
[1:06:30] worry God never told you to be anxious
[1:06:33] oh Hallelujah God don't tell you to give
[1:06:37] up God don't tell you to feel helpless
[1:06:47] negative thinking can also affect our
[1:06:50] relationships with others
[1:06:53] in a variety of ways for example
[1:06:56] negative thought patterns can lead to
[1:07:00] avoidance behaviors now listen to this
[1:07:03] avoidance behavior such as closing
[1:07:06] yourself off from others or refusing to
[1:07:11] engage in meaningful conversation as a
[1:07:14] result negative thinking often leads to
[1:07:17] increased feelings of isolation and
[1:07:21] loneliness
[1:07:23] so the negative thinking itself tends to
[1:07:27] make us to where we just close ourself
[1:07:29] off from everybody else
[1:07:31] and then that leads to more loneliness
[1:07:34] which means you're going to close
[1:07:35] yourself off to everybody else which
[1:07:37] leads to more well nobody understands me
[1:07:39] and nobody wants me which is going to
[1:07:42] lead to more what don't you understand
[1:07:43] we are our greatest enemy
[1:07:48] it's us friends it's our Humanity that's
[1:07:51] our United States were held in this
[1:07:54] prison house and all these things going
[1:07:57] on inside of us and if we're not careful
[1:07:59] but good to a place we think God don't
[1:08:00] even care
[1:08:03] well if we get there we're really in bad
[1:08:05] shape aren't we
[1:08:07] some behaviors to luck out for that
[1:08:10] indicate negative thinking everybody
[1:08:13] listen
[1:08:15] include jumping to conclusions
[1:08:24] blame shifting
[1:08:29] making assumptions
[1:08:32] expecting the worst
[1:08:35] making comparisons
[1:08:41] why are y'all looking like a hound dog
[1:08:42] in the hen house floor this morning
[1:08:46] over generalizing
[1:08:49] so these are attributes of a person
[1:08:52] filling negative thoughts
[1:08:54] I read it again just in case you missed
[1:08:56] it jumping to conclusions
[1:09:00] blame shifting
[1:09:03] making assumptions
[1:09:06] expecting the worst I always had six
[1:09:08] legs I'd raise them all
[1:09:13] these behaviors can lead to resentment
[1:09:17] or mistrust
[1:09:19] making it difficult for people to build
[1:09:22] a strong connection with you
[1:09:25] negative thinking can be a powerful
[1:09:27] force in our Lives having a negative
[1:09:30] impact on our Mental Health
[1:09:33] and well-being if left unchecked
[1:09:36] negative thoughts can take a toll on
[1:09:38] your physical health and your
[1:09:40] relationships and daily function
[1:09:45] all right
[1:09:49] you say brother down there that ain't
[1:09:50] nothing but psychology really
[1:09:52] okay well let's consult Elijah
[1:09:57] you see we have lots of Hope and not
[1:09:59] much Faith but we want to change from
[1:10:02] hope today to positive faith
[1:10:05] and there's only one way we can get
[1:10:08] positive faith that's by thinking of
[1:10:12] positive things
[1:10:16] one way that we can give positive faith
[1:10:20] and that is by amen thinking of positive
[1:10:25] things and the church said
[1:10:28] oh everybody I thought Faith come to
[1:10:30] hearing and hearing by the word it does
[1:10:32] but you're sharing it alone won't do you
[1:10:34] no good you've got to take it into your
[1:10:36] mind as shame said and be not a
[1:10:38] forgetful hearer so you walk out of here
[1:10:40] today and you think about that was some
[1:10:42] great quotes that was some great
[1:10:43] scripture oh man that was a really good
[1:10:45] sermon I enjoyed it but you're going to
[1:10:47] say God by your grace I want to apply to
[1:10:49] my life and I ain't waiting till
[1:10:51] tomorrow I'm going to start today I want
[1:10:54] to get this negative stuff out of me I'm
[1:10:56] going to get away from this negativity
[1:10:58] I'm negative about church I'm a negative
[1:11:01] about the brothers and sisters I'm
[1:11:03] negative about God I am sick of being
[1:11:06] negative I want to be a positive asset
[1:11:09] to the kingdom of God
[1:11:17] notice this when you get to thinking
[1:11:20] about Divine Healing you go to thinking
[1:11:22] about Christ keep him on your mind and
[1:11:25] of course the scripture that we read if
[1:11:27] there be any praise think on this in
[1:11:29] your virtue think on this if any thought
[1:11:32] that comes by that says maybe it
[1:11:34] couldn't be so get it out of your mind
[1:11:37] right quick think on things that's
[1:11:40] positive never let a negative thought
[1:11:43] pass through don't let it stop anyhow if
[1:11:47] it starts keep your thoughts positive
[1:11:50] now watch he jumps down and there's a
[1:11:52] person sitting there in a wheelchair the
[1:11:55] very next paragraph he says now don't
[1:11:57] think sitting there in that wheelchair
[1:11:59] that you're hopeless and helpless you're
[1:12:02] not don't let that negative thought ever
[1:12:06] pass you can you imagine a person
[1:12:07] sitting there in a wheelchair they're
[1:12:09] looking at the paralysis or whatever it
[1:12:11] is maybe they've been there for years
[1:12:13] and years and yet you got this servant
[1:12:15] of God tell telling you don't never let
[1:12:18] what are they going to do act like
[1:12:20] they're not in the wheelchair they're
[1:12:21] going to act like they can walk of
[1:12:23] course what they're going to do is look
[1:12:25] to the promise of God I may be in here
[1:12:28] today but tomorrow may be my day of
[1:12:30] Deliverance I don't know how I don't
[1:12:33] know when but I believe his word what
[1:12:36] will that do it changes them
[1:12:40] oh my again he says the Bible says if
[1:12:43] there be any praise any virtue think on
[1:12:46] these things wondering if I'll be called
[1:12:49] in the prayer line or not don't think
[1:12:51] that kind of negative thought don't let
[1:12:53] it pass through your mind make every
[1:12:56] word
[1:12:57] positive
[1:12:59] God forgive us
[1:13:04] make every word positive and every
[1:13:08] thought positive now this is from the
[1:13:11] spiritual side and this is next
[1:13:13] statement is from the scientific side
[1:13:16] our amazing brain can make decisions and
[1:13:19] respond quickly to threats for our
[1:13:22] safety and survival now think when God
[1:13:24] made man there was no cause there were
[1:13:28] no need of the brain being able to make
[1:13:31] a a decision a quick response and three
[1:13:34] quarters of a second but aren't you glad
[1:13:36] God paced it so that knowing there would
[1:13:39] be automobiles so automatically somebody
[1:13:42] stops in front of you bam before you
[1:13:44] even think about it you've got your foot
[1:13:45] on the brake now what if God would have
[1:13:48] made that response two and a half
[1:13:49] minutes long
[1:13:53] and somebody stops in front of you
[1:13:56] and you are Mr sloths
[1:14:02] you won't last that long I'll be
[1:14:04] preaching your funeral next week
[1:14:08] but what's amazing to me when you look
[1:14:10] at this
[1:14:12] that when man fell
[1:14:14] I woke up early this morning thinking
[1:14:16] about this I thought my what must have
[1:14:19] happened to the human body when Adam
[1:14:21] fell in the Garden of Eden
[1:14:24] it's something about our makeup not only
[1:14:27] in our soul
[1:14:29] but listen to this about the brain when
[1:14:32] we stress or worry or have negative
[1:14:35] thinking we trick
[1:14:38] our brains into believing there is an
[1:14:42] immediate threat
[1:14:44] so when we go to thinking negative and
[1:14:47] down and all that we are tricking our
[1:14:50] brain
[1:14:51] into thinking there's a negative threat
[1:14:55] Lord have mercy it's one of some of our
[1:14:56] brains him work
[1:14:58] we think so much negative stuff
[1:15:00] as a result our fight or flight response
[1:15:04] kicks in our brains now this is what I
[1:15:07] found so amazing our brains are
[1:15:09] pre-wired to respond to negative
[1:15:13] thoughts and feelings more quickly
[1:15:17] than positive
[1:15:21] this is what hit me Harry this morning I
[1:15:23] was thinking
[1:15:24] that change somehow in the Garden of
[1:15:26] Eden
[1:15:29] you see the chains had come over Adam it
[1:15:32] must have been in his hormones
[1:15:34] and must have been in his brain it must
[1:15:37] have been in the response of the human
[1:15:38] spirit all of this chains brother John
[1:15:41] inside the anatomy of the man began to
[1:15:43] change because Adam would have never
[1:15:45] even thought a negative thought prior to
[1:15:48] his fall in the Garden of Eden
[1:15:49] everything would have been positive
[1:15:51] everything would have been wonderful and
[1:15:53] when the chains come over the man watch
[1:15:55] him when the voice of God when the voice
[1:15:58] of God comes in the Garden of Eden that
[1:16:01] he hears it
[1:16:02] then what happens this negative thought
[1:16:05] Adam is afraid he never felt fear before
[1:16:07] so what kicks in fight or flight
[1:16:12] so he runs he hide why because his brain
[1:16:15] for the first time is releasing the
[1:16:18] hormone of cortisol and Adam never felt
[1:16:21] it before it must have been a rush of
[1:16:23] emotions in his body and he runs and
[1:16:25] hides behind the tree he's never felt it
[1:16:28] before his heart pumping and racing his
[1:16:31] blood pressure fluctuating the flushing
[1:16:34] in his face all this going on inside of
[1:16:36] his body
[1:16:38] I switch what we felt all of our entire
[1:16:41] life
[1:16:42] but I'm telling you one thing we're
[1:16:44] going back to another body
[1:16:46] when there won't be no more hormones
[1:16:48] released like this in her body there
[1:16:51] won't be no fighting or fight it'll be
[1:16:53] eternal life
[1:16:54] eternal Joy Eternal peace can't you see
[1:16:57] why we need such a change in our bodies
[1:17:05] our brains are pre-wired to respond to
[1:17:08] negative thoughts and feelings more
[1:17:09] quickly than positive when we think
[1:17:12] positively our brain assumes
[1:17:16] that everything is under control
[1:17:19] and no action is needed
[1:17:22] so when you're just sitting there
[1:17:24] thinking you know whatever the positive
[1:17:26] thoughts in your mind God loves me
[1:17:28] everything's going to be all right I
[1:17:29] mean it's looking bad but everything is
[1:17:31] going to be all right your brain is just
[1:17:33] in modern terminology chilling out
[1:17:38] why because there's nothing from your
[1:17:40] thought pattern that's releasing to this
[1:17:44] almond-shaped part of your gray matter
[1:17:46] that's saying danger danger danger
[1:17:49] danger positive thoughts are calming it
[1:17:52] down
[1:17:54] you know Erica's many of you know have
[1:17:56] been going through this cancer situation
[1:17:58] I don't know how many of the doctors and
[1:17:59] things that that we've been to and
[1:18:01] they've emphasized it over and over
[1:18:03] again positive thoughts positive
[1:18:06] thinking thinking the right way thinking
[1:18:09] and looking at how many knows that they
[1:18:10] do that many of them are broken to bang
[1:18:12] and the doctor's offices and different
[1:18:15] ones that we've been into and on this
[1:18:16] wall there'll be a positive thought
[1:18:18] there'll be a scripture there there'll
[1:18:19] be something there what's it for to lift
[1:18:22] up your attitude to be able to keep you
[1:18:24] higher in that sphere why because they
[1:18:27] know it they know it by the autonomy and
[1:18:29] looking at how we are made up that it
[1:18:31] releases something in our body and if
[1:18:34] people go in in a negative way brother
[1:18:36] Daryl told me something several years
[1:18:37] ago that a man whenever he was still in
[1:18:39] surgery a man come in at a very minor
[1:18:42] surgery he was going to face at the VA

[1:18:55] you're not going to die they got into
[1:18:57] the surgery something went terribly
[1:18:58] wrong the man died on the operating
[1:19:00] table brother said he thought about it
[1:19:03] so many times they put the man out under
[1:19:06] the anesthesia it is his mindset it's
[1:19:08] where he's at oh my what about us as the
[1:19:12] people of God oh it's getting dark out

[1:19:48] touching anything it shall be done
[1:19:51] whatever you ask in my name I will do it
[1:20:01] oh my
[1:20:04] recent studies show that the
[1:20:07] psychological stress
[1:20:09] is causing an overuse
[1:20:12] of the powerful safety system in our
[1:20:15] bodies
[1:20:15] weakening our immune system
[1:20:22] you can take Vitamin C till you turn
[1:20:24] into one of them jelly vitamin C's
[1:20:28] some of you've got the office regimen
[1:20:30] that ever was
[1:20:32] covet anxiety has drove some of us batty

[1:20:38] Carlos we're taking vitamins see it
[1:20:40] we're rubbing all on our feet and
[1:20:41] rubbing all on our hands and rubbing
[1:20:43] this and that and well go ahead and look
[1:20:45] at me funny if you want to scared to
[1:20:47] death the covet scared to death of the
[1:20:49] fluid I'll tell you one thing I believe
[1:20:51] if we take God's word and put it in our
[1:20:53] heart and on our mouths it does no
[1:20:56] telling what it will do just in our
[1:20:58] natural body oh my because negative
[1:21:02] thoughts and the fear and the trauma of
[1:21:04] this and that what does it do it lowers
[1:21:06] your immune system
[1:21:09] I've got the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[1:21:11] and in your immune system the Holy Ghost
[1:21:14] is not controlling your immune system
[1:21:16] you need your mouth too and your brain
[1:21:19] too and your thoughts to control it
[1:21:25] [Applause]
[1:21:28] listen this thinking negatively about
[1:21:32] your problems
[1:21:33] not only doesn't help solve anything it
[1:21:37] makes it harder actually makes it harder
[1:21:40] for you to think
[1:21:43] of the helpful
[1:21:45] solution
[1:21:47] well John when I started looking at this
[1:21:49] I rolled up my sleeves and I said devil
[1:21:51] where are you I'm ready to box you right
[1:21:54] in the mouth look at what you've done to
[1:21:56] us you put us under this negative
[1:21:58] thinking knowing that our brain gets so
[1:22:01] overloaded with all this stuff that we
[1:22:03] can't even think properly in the right
[1:22:06] Avenue
[1:22:07] and who's doing it oh yeah I will blame
[1:22:09] the devil it's us
[1:22:16] now let me read to you this little thing
[1:22:18] in your brain each one of you have it
[1:22:19] today
[1:22:20] you've never seen it nor thy amygdala
[1:22:24] if you have a tendency to overreact to
[1:22:27] stress it could be to changes in your
[1:22:30] brain
[1:22:31] brought on by negative thinking now can
[1:22:34] you imagine you notice what I'm trying
[1:22:35] to do today I'm trying to change your
[1:22:38] brain as well as your soul
[1:22:41] I don't want you just to get born again
[1:22:43] and filled with the Holy Ghost I want
[1:22:45] your amygdala to be changed
[1:22:50] might be a good sermon to preach in a
[1:22:52] convention sometime
[1:22:54] hahaha
[1:22:55] notice what happens
[1:22:59] if you have a tendency to overreact to
[1:23:02] stress it could be due to changes in
[1:23:05] your brain brought on by negative
[1:23:08] thinking
[1:23:09] so how you react to stress can be
[1:23:13] dictated by negative thinking negative
[1:23:16] experiences are stored in the brain by
[1:23:21] the amygdala ah
[1:23:24] stored there
[1:23:26] the amygdala is also responsible for the
[1:23:29] brain's fight or fight response the
[1:23:32] prefrontal cortex
[1:23:35] y'all didn't know you have on them
[1:23:36] either did you the prefrontal cortex
[1:23:39] regulates our response
[1:23:42] to stressors
[1:23:44] so this little almond-shaped gray matter
[1:23:48] in your brain
[1:23:50] it controls this response fight or fight
[1:23:55] also has to do with memory
[1:23:58] so you see a certain person relive a
[1:24:01] certain thing
[1:24:02] and all of a sudden it brings it back
[1:24:05] I told you before I preaching several
[1:24:07] years ago in Arkansas and there's a
[1:24:08] brother there a friend of mine I've
[1:24:09] known him for years and years and I was
[1:24:11] preaching on the Avenue of scars and
[1:24:13] things like that and I noticed the
[1:24:14] brother
[1:24:15] as I was speaking and he was so intent
[1:24:19] and I noticed him as he started sweating
[1:24:21] like in the service that'd been unusual
[1:24:23] for me because I was doing the preaching
[1:24:24] but he just sitting there and I just
[1:24:27] noticed his demeanor everything about
[1:24:29] him was so different
[1:24:31] and they brought out a red Gatorade for
[1:24:35] me
[1:24:35] in case I needed it when I preached
[1:24:38] and I noticed as I unscrewed that and I
[1:24:41] drank part of it and it just this look
[1:24:42] came on his face
[1:24:45] so at the end of the service he come up
[1:24:46] for prayer he called me as I was driving
[1:24:48] down the road Karen I left the service
[1:24:50] last night that that not heading home
[1:24:51] and he said brother Donnie I'm sure you
[1:24:54] noticed I was acting different I said I
[1:24:56] did Brother
[1:24:57] they said well let me tell you I was a
[1:24:59] builder a contractor several years ago
[1:25:01] and he said they would let us dig a pit
[1:25:03] and we would burn the refuse two befores
[1:25:07] and this and that and the other and said
[1:25:08] one morning as we were putting this my
[1:25:11] helpers and myself all this garbage in
[1:25:14] this pit I stepped to the edge of this
[1:25:16] pit the farm was already going and the
[1:25:19] side gave way and I fell into the fire
[1:25:22] and he said I started hollering and
[1:25:25] screaming for the guys to come and help
[1:25:27] me and they come and they they got me
[1:25:29] out of there but by the time they got
[1:25:30] him out his body was burned and he had
[1:25:32] some places on him and burned him really
[1:25:34] bad they'd stop that morning coming to
[1:25:37] work and they got a cooler and they
[1:25:39] bought several different types of you
[1:25:43] guessed it
[1:25:44] Gatorade
[1:25:47] so they bring to him a great big large
[1:25:49] Gatorade and he starts drinking it and
[1:25:52] the ambulance comes and gets him he had
[1:25:54] some pretty severe burns on his body and
[1:25:56] he said as you were preaching that
[1:25:59] I begin to relive it
[1:26:02] and his body was reacting to that memory
[1:26:07] so he was sweating nor doubt the
[1:26:10] hormones being released in his body
[1:26:12] anybody had ever had something similar
[1:26:14] to happen somebody's name is mentioned
[1:26:16] or a preacher mentions a certain
[1:26:18] circumstances or situation and you get
[1:26:20] all nervous and you feel like
[1:26:21] everybody's looking at you what is that
[1:26:23] that's coming from within you the
[1:26:25] hormones in your body are associated
[1:26:27] with that and that relives it again then
[1:26:30] when you go to thinking that way it puts
[1:26:32] the body in this this fight or flight I
[1:26:35] mean I've watched people before and I've
[1:26:36] honestly thought some of them I've seen
[1:26:38] them do it when you go to preaching on a
[1:26:40] certain thing they'll get up and run out
[1:26:41] they can't take it they cannot take it
[1:26:44] because in their mind they are reliving
[1:26:46] that and the thing they do is flight and
[1:26:49] they get up and they leave they cannot
[1:26:51] stand what it does that is so sad to me
[1:26:56] why don't we pray for people for these
[1:26:58] things
[1:26:59] why don't is it the physical part in the
[1:27:02] body
[1:27:02] why is it headaches back aches toe aches
[1:27:06] this and that and the other I wonder how
[1:27:08] many are hurting my friends that have
[1:27:09] all these things inside of their spirit
[1:27:11] and they live a life in bondage day in
[1:27:15] and day out and what are their bars what
[1:27:19] are their bars what is their prison
[1:27:21] thoughts memories
[1:27:24] affections that's been sown in the wrong
[1:27:26] way
[1:27:28] notice this
[1:27:30] oh my someone who's faced with a
[1:27:33] stressful situation like being in a
[1:27:36] traffic jam normally assesses the level
[1:27:39] of the threat in their safety to their
[1:27:42] safety and concludes that the threat is
[1:27:46] pretty much just an annoyance
[1:27:49] now that blue-haired woman driving down
[1:27:52] the road on Milligan Highway and she's
[1:27:55] going 21 miles an hour how do you know
[1:27:57] because you cocked her
[1:28:00] it's a 40 mile an hour speed zoning
[1:28:02] you're in a hurry you've got to go here
[1:28:04] and there there she is
[1:28:07] and you're saying oh my goodness oh my
[1:28:10] goodness in reality that is an annoyance
[1:28:13] more than it is a danger to your life
[1:28:15] unless you Pastor on the double yellow
[1:28:17] line
[1:28:18] but what do we do depending on how our
[1:28:22] makeup is
[1:28:23] and whether we lean towards a positive
[1:28:25] or the negative some folks stress out
[1:28:28] we're living in one of the most
[1:28:30] stressful times it's ever been you don't
[1:28:32] ask me go to Walmart this evening and
[1:28:34] you fixing to pull into that parking
[1:28:36] spot right there and that person who saw
[1:28:38] that a half a mile away they wanted that
[1:28:40] parking spot and they'll talk to you
[1:28:42] worse than if you as a dog well they not
[1:28:44] you'd get pulled out in front of them
[1:28:46] you get out of their way they're honking
[1:28:48] their horn they pull up us out of you
[1:28:50] and look at you like they say what did I
[1:28:51] do what did I do people are living under
[1:28:55] such stress is it any Wonder friends
[1:28:57] that people pull out their gun and kill
[1:28:59] somebody over somebody pulling out from
[1:29:01] why because this is where Satan wants us
[1:29:04] to live he wants us to live so stressed
[1:29:07] out that we can't even enjoy life we
[1:29:11] can't enjoy God we cannot enjoy being
[1:29:14] with our family and our loved one
[1:29:15] because everybody is just so stressed
[1:29:22] foreign
[1:29:26] nerve pills from one another
[1:29:31] you can tell when people are getting old
[1:29:33] I've noticed in the last few years
[1:29:34] myself and it makes me realize how I'm
[1:29:37] getting older because you hear the
[1:29:39] people you're sitting around talking
[1:29:40] about and they're describing their
[1:29:42] medications
[1:29:46] and they're talking about their Medicare
[1:29:48] card and they're telling you realize
[1:29:50] yeah I've definitely changed
[1:29:52] dispensations ever you still wasn't my
[1:29:54] line of talk and you realize oh I've
[1:29:56] been so stressing which one do you take
[1:29:58] and I it amazes me how well first our
[1:30:01] people are on medications
[1:30:04] it amazing me oh yeah I take so many
[1:30:06] milligrams of that too and I think that
[1:30:08] have you heard of this one that now I'll
[1:30:10] tell you what I heard I heard it is so
[1:30:12] good if you take a little bit around and
[1:30:14] swish it around with a little bit of
[1:30:15] banana oil and you mix it with a little
[1:30:17] bit of this and that and the other you
[1:30:19] know and it's amazing how medical that
[1:30:21] we are what is it friends we're
[1:30:23] searching for peace we're searching for
[1:30:26] a little bit of relief from distress and
[1:30:29] this pressure that we live under I'll
[1:30:32] tell you where it's going to come from
[1:30:33] to a real Believer from within yourself
[1:30:37] Oh Glory to God if we can get our minds
[1:30:40] and our soul in harmony with God's word
[1:30:43] you can tone your own world around from
[1:30:47] within you
[1:30:51] [Applause]
[1:31:00] as far as your brain is concerned every
[1:31:03] thought every thought
[1:31:06] releases
[1:31:08] brain chemicals
[1:31:11] being focused on negative thoughts
[1:31:14] effectively saps the brain
[1:31:18] of positive
[1:31:20] forcefulness
[1:31:21] slows it down
[1:31:23] and goes to dimming the brain's ability
[1:31:26] to function even creating
[1:31:31] creating
[1:31:33] depression
[1:31:37] now remember Satan is not a creator
[1:31:40] but if he can get you and I sad enough
[1:31:43] low enough
[1:31:45] than we ourselves will create
[1:31:49] our own depression
[1:31:56] well you figure I just figured I need to
[1:31:58] take myself at the time just knock
[1:31:59] myself out this morning
[1:32:03] wow you mean I am truly my greatest
[1:32:06] enemy
[1:32:14] on the flip side
[1:32:15] thinking positive happy
[1:32:18] hopeful
[1:32:20] optimistic joyful thoughts
[1:32:23] decreases cortisol
[1:32:27] and produces
[1:32:28] serotonin
[1:32:32] ah
[1:32:36] do you understand this is what cocaine
[1:32:38] does
[1:32:40] do you understand many of the addictive
[1:32:41] drugs that people get so addicted to
[1:32:43] that it goes to that part of your brain
[1:32:47] which is the feel-good part
[1:32:51] and it releases these Mega doses of
[1:32:55] dopamine and serotonin and this is why
[1:32:58] people get so addicted to it because
[1:33:01] cocaine and many of these other things
[1:33:03] it releases it in such high doses that
[1:33:06] once they feel that high
[1:33:08] then they've got to get back again and
[1:33:10] again and again but the thing of it is
[1:33:12] once they take it they have to have more
[1:33:14] and more and more the next time
[1:33:16] unless of course you realize the true
[1:33:19] Factory can be within yourself
[1:33:22] you can be your own Factory as a child
[1:33:25] of God of producing these good things
[1:33:28] within yourself
[1:33:29] you can also be one casting out Devils
[1:33:32] of them evil thoughts
[1:33:34] praise the Lord can you imagine that God
[1:33:37] made the brain and apparently it fell in
[1:33:40] the father whenever Adam's Body if it
[1:33:42] did produce cortisol it had been hell
[1:33:44] captive until the fall and once man fell
[1:33:47] then the ability to release this
[1:33:49] cortisol in his body was then he began
[1:33:51] to experience it it must have been
[1:33:53] frightening it must have been
[1:33:54] frightening for Adam the first time that
[1:33:56] he felt this Mega release of cortisol in
[1:33:59] his body and his serotonin the dopamine
[1:34:01] was so minimized and it became fearful
[1:34:04] and afraid of what is what is this
[1:34:06] feeling I've never felt this way before
[1:34:07] what is it this is why Christians get in
[1:34:10] such anxiety and get so stressful little
[1:34:13] Saturn look at me don't you understand
[1:34:15] that Christians can be depressed
[1:34:17] Christians can get to a place where they
[1:34:19] have to go to a mental institution that
[1:34:21] don't mean they're not saved people that
[1:34:23] don't mean they're not children of God
[1:34:25] they've got overwhelmed by the factory
[1:34:28] in their own bodies
[1:34:34] oh
[1:34:38] so on the flip side thinking positive
[1:34:40] happy hopeful optimistic joyful thoughts
[1:34:44] decrease his cortisol
[1:34:45] produce serotonin which creates a sense
[1:34:49] of well-being this helps your brain to
[1:34:53] function at Peak capacity
[1:34:56] why wouldn't that be awesome
[1:34:58] I'm not sure how far I could pass your
[1:35:01] mind has ever been but it's been nice at
[1:35:02] least once before I die to reach the
[1:35:04] peak
[1:35:06] listen to this happy thoughts and
[1:35:09] positive thinking in general
[1:35:11] support brain growth
[1:35:16] as well as the generation and
[1:35:19] reinforcement of new synopsis
[1:35:23] whatever that is
[1:35:27] especially in the prefrontal core fix
[1:35:30] PVC they call it which serves as the
[1:35:33] integration Center of all your brain
[1:35:36] mind functions
[1:35:39] so you just sitting around thinking oh
[1:35:41] Jesus I love you Jesus You're My Healer
[1:35:44] oh God how good you are you've been go
[1:35:48] you've been so good to me Lord You've
[1:35:50] healed me you've saved me you've
[1:35:51] Sanctified me Lord I don't know what's
[1:35:53] fixing to come ahead but I know one
[1:35:55] thing you're the one who holds the
[1:35:56] future
[1:35:57] and all of a sudden your cortisol is
[1:35:59] getting all bucket down man this is
[1:36:01] going down and your serotonin said and
[1:36:03] what does it do it releases this in your
[1:36:06] brain and it rewards your body this is
[1:36:09] what this is It's a reward of your body
[1:36:12] for thinking in a positive way so when
[1:36:14] you think in a positive way then these
[1:36:17] hormones are released from the PFC out
[1:36:19] of your brain and it's rewarding your
[1:36:22] body for thinking that way and it's
[1:36:24] actually produces a feeling inside of
[1:36:26] you
[1:36:29] you ever think just something happy and
[1:36:31] you feel a change like and then you get
[1:36:33] a phone call or a text oh my God
[1:36:36] and you go to feeling this you know what
[1:36:38] it is it's the thought you associate
[1:36:40] every lease item the chemical Factory of
[1:36:43] your brain oh children can't you see
[1:36:45] can't you see what God wants us to be
[1:36:48] living in the middle of hell he don't
[1:36:51] want us to be bound by hell living in
[1:36:53] the middle of depression living in the
[1:36:55] middle of sadness God don't want us to
[1:36:57] be controlled by sadness
[1:36:59] he wants us to be a little Creator
[1:37:01] within ourself
[1:37:06] let me close
[1:37:08] although you'll always have another sort
[1:37:11] of simple statement right here somebody
[1:37:12] needs to make a t-shirt or something
[1:37:14] with this although you'll always have
[1:37:16] stress and obstacles in your life
[1:37:18] they don't have to Define your mindset
[1:37:21] as you replace pessimistic thinking with
[1:37:23] optimism your life can be more abundant
[1:37:26] you will have the occasional storms
[1:37:29] but your positive outlook this part I'm
[1:37:31] talking about right here becomes your
[1:37:34] umbrella
[1:37:41] you're positive outlook
[1:37:44] becomes
[1:37:45] your umbrella
[1:37:47] so the umbrella as you know does not
[1:37:50] drive away the storm your umbrella does
[1:37:54] not make the clouds by the Jack
[1:37:55] disappear but you have your own little
[1:37:58] personal protection
[1:38:00] now it may not be but this bigger you
[1:38:02] might have one of them great old Biggins
[1:38:03] if the Deacon Brothers has got Brother
[1:38:05] JD brought me in on one a while ago it
[1:38:07] was a pretty good size of the thing so
[1:38:08] me and him both was able to get under it
[1:38:10] if we get enough positivity about the
[1:38:12] Holy Ghost Inside of us we might have
[1:38:15] enough room for a brother or a sister or
[1:38:17] maybe a daughter of God that's going
[1:38:19] through such sadness in their life they
[1:38:21] might need a little bit of protection
[1:38:22] under your umbrella oh my hallelujah
[1:38:27] what can God do for us if we can get our
[1:38:30] thinking right
[1:38:35] listen
[1:38:43] praise the Lord
[1:38:45] praise the Lord
[1:38:48] oh don't you love him
[1:38:50] let me read this to you
[1:38:52] now it's a strange saying the prophet
[1:38:54] said
[1:38:55] people will say well I'm weak my faith
[1:38:58] is not very much I'm not a very good
[1:39:00] Christian that's just what the devil
[1:39:02] wants you to say
[1:39:04] you're talking his language
[1:39:06] right then
[1:39:08] you mustn't ever
[1:39:16] don't never let your testimony be
[1:39:19] negative
[1:39:21] let it be positive all the time amen
[1:39:25] amen I'm saved I have God in my heart
[1:39:29] I believe him with all my heart do you
[1:39:31] believe in Divine Healing because all my
[1:39:33] heart he says let your testimony always
[1:39:35] in your thoughts never permit a negative
[1:39:38] thought to come in your mind if you can
[1:39:39] help it and when it starts out don't
[1:39:42] entertain it
[1:39:43] well you say I can't keep them thoughts
[1:39:46] from coming
[1:39:47] well be like the farmer that said he
[1:39:50] couldn't stop the birds from flying over
[1:39:52] his place
[1:39:54] and this is your place
[1:39:56] God wants this to be your happy place
[1:39:59] this is your place right here now once
[1:40:02] the farmer said he couldn't stop the
[1:40:04] birds from flying over his place
[1:40:06] but he sure could stop him from roosting
[1:40:10] you can't help thoughts when they come
[1:40:12] but don't entertain them pass them on no
[1:40:16] sir Jesus Christ is my savior all things
[1:40:19] are mined by God's grace
[1:40:21] I'm going to testify of them and God can
[1:40:25] only bless you as you confess he has
[1:40:29] done it for you
[1:40:31] my
[1:40:33] Lord he's the high priest of our
[1:40:34] confession he can only do for us here's
[1:40:38] our ABC's again
[1:40:40] as we accept it a
[1:40:43] and only Omar as we believe it be and
[1:40:48] confess it see a b c except believe
[1:40:54] confess
[1:40:56] now remember the prophet finished that
[1:40:58] story about that farmer and saying that
[1:40:59] the farmer said he couldn't stop the
[1:41:01] birds from flying over but if they
[1:41:03] roosted
[1:41:04] there's no negative thoughts that might
[1:41:05] turn on top of that speaker so he said
[1:41:07] you got a double barrel shotgun Old and
[1:41:09] New Testament hang tight with me
[1:41:16] this one sent back on top by camera let
[1:41:18] me take care of him
[1:41:20] nobody loves you you ain't got a friend
[1:41:22] in the world
[1:41:25] you sisters ought to be shotgun packing
[1:41:28] toten's women
[1:41:29] your brothers ought to be shotgun
[1:41:31] packing Toten Brothers
[1:41:33] I'll tell you one thing we started
[1:41:35] packing more like that aiming them at
[1:41:36] the Devil instead of Amen to one another
[1:41:37] would be a whole lot better off
[1:41:40] we're really good at shooting one
[1:41:42] another
[1:41:50] and the church said
[1:41:53] help us Lord
[1:41:55] can you say that help me Lord
[1:41:59] that's about his if you would
[1:42:03] Hemi doesn't want this just to be words
[1:42:05] today but you want it to be something
[1:42:06] that God helps you with me too
[1:42:09] me too Lord
[1:42:13] Heavenly Father
[1:42:17] we ask you today Lord Jesus that you
[1:42:19] would help us
[1:42:21] Lord as I begin to study this I realize
[1:42:23] that
[1:42:25] we're born with this negativity about us
[1:42:29] many of us were fed this by our parents
[1:42:31] Maybe by children
[1:42:34] we know how sometimes cruel children can
[1:42:36] be that we go went to school with
[1:42:38] that criticizes us and ridicule us
[1:42:41] no doubt some of these people here today
[1:42:43] can remember things they went through at
[1:42:45] school and maybe at home
[1:42:47] things that set a negative thing about
[1:42:49] them
[1:42:51] Lord I remember myself we was always
[1:42:53] poor
[1:42:54] daddy worked at a minimum wage and me
[1:42:57] being the oldest of seven kids so we
[1:42:59] never had nice things
[1:43:02] I remember standing on the playground
[1:43:05] Wayne County Elementary School
[1:43:08] wishing I had a friend
[1:43:10] I'd stand out there by myself recess
[1:43:13] after recess
[1:43:15] nobody wouldn't speak to me
[1:43:17] had on ragged clothes
[1:43:19] if we got new shoes or anything like
[1:43:21] that whenever we did get them they all
[1:43:23] come from the dollar store and everybody
[1:43:25] knew they did
[1:43:27] so they'd laugh at us make fun of us
[1:43:31] and Lord we know those things can affect
[1:43:33] us even when we get older
[1:43:36] Lord God we pray today that you would
[1:43:38] help us
[1:43:39] not to just focus maybe on our
[1:43:42] upbringing and our clothes didn't come
[1:43:44] from the mall and we didn't have the
[1:43:46] very best of purses and we didn't have
[1:43:48] the very best of tennis shoes and that
[1:43:50] sort of thing people thought just life
[1:43:52] huh that don't make no difference but if
[1:43:55] they really be truthful they'd say a lot
[1:43:57] of their problems tie back to such
[1:43:59] things
[1:44:00] when they were young
[1:44:02] some are rejected by their parents some
[1:44:05] father walked off and left a mother
[1:44:07] walked off and left him it instilled the
[1:44:09] fear in them they hold that trauma
[1:44:12] afraid they'll be left their whole life
[1:44:15] Lord God please help us Jesus
[1:44:19] help us Lord
[1:44:22] we know Lord that
[1:44:25] these things are formed in our brain
[1:44:26] called dendrites it's like the branches
[1:44:29] on a tree
[1:44:32] bad memories and good memories both make
[1:44:34] these dendrites and whenever something
[1:44:36] will run across our mind to recall the
[1:44:38] bad memory of an individual or
[1:44:41] something that happened
[1:44:43] that hormone released in our body and it
[1:44:45] causes the same feeling that thing may
[1:44:47] have happened 30 years ago that's why
[1:44:49] the discernment the prophet would call
[1:44:50] people out and tell them things that
[1:44:51] happened to him 30 years before that
[1:44:54] because that dendrite was stored in the
[1:44:56] brain
[1:44:57] but the way to get rid of those
[1:44:59] is to make more good ones
[1:45:02] so maybe there's some here today
[1:45:03] struggling in their marriage and they're
[1:45:05] having a hard time forgiving one another
[1:45:06] for this and that
[1:45:08] help them Lord to try to move beyond the
[1:45:10] past and the failures and start making
[1:45:13] new memories
[1:45:15] maybe they've been burnt by church maybe
[1:45:17] they've been burnt by preachers and they
[1:45:19] let them bad memories keep them out Lord
[1:45:22] God may we start today making new ones
[1:45:27] help us Jesus
[1:45:29] help us take control of this Factory in
[1:45:32] our body
[1:45:33] called our brain
[1:45:35] that daily releases all these
[1:45:38] multiplication of hormones in our body
[1:45:41] we quote the scriptures and quote the
[1:45:43] scriptures and we love you with all of
[1:45:44] our heart and we want to be faithful and
[1:45:46] true
[1:45:47] and we're trying to approach it from the
[1:45:49] soul and we think it's Soul trouble
[1:45:51] that's why many of them struggle with
[1:45:53] having the Holy Ghost
[1:45:54] because they think it's Soul trouble
[1:45:57] when a lot of it ain't Soul trouble it's
[1:45:59] brain trouble
[1:46:01] it's Spirit trouble
[1:46:03] it's dendrite trouble it's memory
[1:46:05] trouble
[1:46:06] imagination trouble
[1:46:09] oh Jesus speak to us today I pray father
[1:46:14] we love you today Father
[1:46:18] anybody here just by raising your hands
[1:46:21] signifying to the Lord Lord I need your
[1:46:23] help today
[1:46:25] I need your help Jesus
[1:46:29] we love you father
[1:46:31] come by this way Lord
[1:46:34] may not our imagination control us our
[1:46:36] affection
[1:46:37] our memory but may the spirit of God so
[1:46:41] control us from our soul
[1:46:43] that it brings our bodies subject to the
[1:46:45] word
[1:46:47] it brings our spirit and all these
[1:46:49] memories and things that we had in our
[1:46:51] life
[1:46:52] that have haunted us Lord God
[1:46:55] may we be able to have new thoughts and
[1:46:58] new memories may we think on whatsoever
[1:47:01] things are lovely whatsoever things are
[1:47:04] true
[1:47:05] whatsoever things are of a good report
[1:47:08] think on these things for we know the
[1:47:11] word said for as a man thinketh in his
[1:47:13] heart
[1:47:14] so is he
[1:47:17] help us I pray Lord God
[1:47:27] peace of God
[1:47:30] cover me
[1:47:36] cover me
[1:47:39] her sister Holly is facing a surgery
[1:47:41] concerning her neck many of you probably
[1:47:43] know about it a very serious thing
[1:47:46] naturally the human part she's dreading
[1:47:49] it and fearful of it but Henry believes
[1:47:52] today the Lord can bring peace to our
[1:47:53] sister
[1:47:54] if this is God's way we know the prophet
[1:47:56] said God heals my surgery God heals my
[1:47:58] love God heals my music God heals many
[1:48:00] different Avenues if this is the Lord's
[1:48:02] God's way then we'll just accept it that
[1:48:04] way this is John our faith together with
[1:48:07] her
[1:48:09] Satan
[1:48:12] you're a liar
[1:48:15] I condemn you
[1:48:17] in the name of Jesus go back to hell
[1:48:20] where you come from
[1:48:22] this is a daughter of God
[1:48:24] it's not enough that you attack her but
[1:48:27] now she's looking at a way which she can
[1:48:30] be remedied by this and now what do you
[1:48:33] do you low down devil now you try to
[1:48:37] encapsulate her heart and fear
[1:48:40] but in the name of Jesus I resent this
[1:48:42] fear
[1:48:44] Hallelujah
[1:48:46] for the word says Thou will keep him in
[1:48:49] perfect peace whose mind is stayed on me
[1:48:53] Lord God in the name of Jesus I rebuke
[1:48:55] this fear away from my sister right now
[1:48:58] father you see Lord the doctors have
[1:49:01] done everything they know to do up to
[1:49:03] this stage and this is what they feel
[1:49:05] like is the next stage to bring our
[1:49:07] sister relief of this situation father I
[1:49:11] pray in Jesus Christ's name May the
[1:49:14] spirit of God be with her Lord give her
[1:49:16] that peace Lord the anxiety for waiting
[1:49:19] for a couple of more weeks for it to
[1:49:21] happen oh God In The Name of Jesus may
[1:49:24] she be able to walk away from here today
[1:49:26] with a peace in her heart knowing that
[1:49:28] in that surgery room that day the angels
[1:49:31] of God will be there the spirit of God
[1:49:33] will guide that surgeon's hand be with
[1:49:36] her father
[1:49:38] made accomplish Lord what they wanted to
[1:49:40] I pray oh Hallelujah in the name of
[1:49:45] Jesus

[1:49:56] thank
[1:49:58] you brother Larry
[1:50:01] got a situation with his heart and the
[1:50:03] Lord knows all about it very serious
[1:50:06] situations versus what the doctor says
[1:50:09] but the more serious the greater the
[1:50:12] victory the greater the miracle in our
[1:50:14] God
[1:50:15] we love brother Larry don't want to be
[1:50:17] appreciated
[1:50:18] let's pray for him today
[1:50:22] Heavenly Father
[1:50:24] you're the first one
[1:50:26] and the only one
[1:50:28] to ever make a human heart
[1:50:32] the Angels must have been awed that day
[1:50:34] as they come down in the Garden of Eden
[1:50:36] and they watched you take dust
[1:50:40] red clay
[1:50:42] and shaped ventricles and pumps and all
[1:50:45] muscles and all these things and they
[1:50:47] watched your Mighty hand as you made the
[1:50:51] first human heart
[1:50:54] Hallelujah
[1:50:55] Lord God you see what the doctors have
[1:50:58] told our brother about his human heart
[1:51:01] but Lord as Believers we agreed together
[1:51:04] for our brother in the name of Jesus
[1:51:08] if you're the one who made the first one
[1:51:10] we believe you're the one who can repair
[1:51:12] this one so I lay my hands on his
[1:51:15] Beating Heart in his chest today Father
[1:51:18] in the name of Jesus move for our
[1:51:21] brother
[1:51:21] Lord God we believe you're a miracle
[1:51:24] worker
[1:51:25] May the same one who created the first
[1:51:28] heart
[1:51:28] go down inside my brother's body today
[1:51:31] and correct this father
[1:51:34] in the name of Jesus

[2:04:22] since she's been a little old thing
[2:04:24] she's loved to go to church
[2:04:26] this thing has kept out of service after
[2:04:29] service
[2:04:30] and I believe God's going to turn it
[2:04:32] around
[2:04:36] disagree together
[2:04:39] Heavenly Father
[2:04:41] in the name of Jesus
[2:04:43] you see this needing Erica's body today
[2:04:48] Lord I know how she loves church
[2:04:51] we took her in the office the other day
[2:04:53] at the new place and showed her the
[2:04:55] couch sitting there and told her she'd
[2:04:56] be able to
[2:04:57] come in there and lay down if she wasn't
[2:04:59] strong enough to be able to set out in
[2:05:01] the audience
[2:05:03] in a monitor there we should be able to
[2:05:04] watch the service
[2:05:07] if that happens we're just believing
[2:05:09] that's going to be temporary
[2:05:11] until she's going to be able to walk out
[2:05:13] on that platform amen and sit out there
[2:05:15] with the saints of God and worship and
[2:05:17] praise
[2:05:18] dear God you see this need in our body
[2:05:21] you see what the doctors call it
[2:05:23] neuroendocrine tumor
[2:05:25] you see their diagnosis you say that you
[2:05:28] see what they say there's no cure this
[2:05:31] that the other but that's their report
[2:05:34] and no doubt the best they know
[2:05:36] and we're thankful for everything that
[2:05:38] they have done to be able to help her
[2:05:40] but we're looking today to another
[2:05:43] report
[2:05:44] and that's the one we choose to believe
[2:05:48] we want to overwhelm our brain with
[2:05:51] those positive thoughts
[2:05:54] Lord God would you touch your father
[2:05:56] you see the pain she's been having Lord
[2:05:58] in the name of Jesus
[2:06:00] when you come to this earth you were
[2:06:02] associated with pain you felt pain all
[2:06:05] types of pain would you go to are now
[2:06:08] Lord God and touch her
[2:06:09] in the name of Jesus Christ we pray
[2:06:13] amen
[2:06:14] God bless you Saints love you in the
[2:06:16] Lord
[2:06:17] Lord willing I'm not sure brother we've
[2:06:19] probably already announced it Be Heaven
[2:06:21] first we have Heaven more like an open
[2:06:23] house well I guess in a house against
[2:06:24] open Church ain't it
[2:06:26] open church on Wednesday night just so
[2:06:29] everybody can kind of come in and look
[2:06:30] at it and you know look around try to
[2:06:32] find your seat I don't know how many
[2:06:33] people's already been there picking out
[2:06:35] their seats
[2:06:36] so hopefully we will have 10 people
[2:06:38] wanting the same seat
[2:06:40] the only problem I foresee with doing it
[2:06:42] is one couple come in the brother want
[2:06:43] to sit on this side and his wife wanted
[2:06:45] to sit over there so
[2:06:46] hopefully they'll get that worked out
[2:06:48] but we thought it'd be easier for you to
[2:06:50] come in just look around for those of
[2:06:51] you that haven't been there and then
[2:06:53] we'll have the first service next Sunday
[2:06:55] and we're just looking forward for what
[2:06:57] the Lord is going to do for us there so
[2:06:59] if you can come there Wednesday night
[2:07:01] you're more than welcome to come and
[2:07:02] just have some time of Fellowship as we
[2:07:04] look around then we're going to have
[2:07:05] some singing and just remember the all
[2:07:08] the equipment there is new the audio the
[2:07:10] video the cameras the internet so please
[2:07:14] be patient with our brothers we've got
[2:07:16] some very impatient streamers and
[2:07:18] whenever something goes happen within
[2:07:20] two or three minutes they're ringing
[2:07:21] these brother's phone so please just be
[2:07:23] patient with us while we make this
[2:07:25] transition we'll hopefully make it
[2:07:27] better so we don't want people to lose
[2:07:29] their religion because they couldn't
[2:07:30] stream a service
[2:07:35] so be patient with this as we go through
[2:07:37] this learning process
[2:07:38] that means in love with the Lord today
