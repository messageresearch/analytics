[6:50] keeping our eyes on the prize at the end
[6:53] of the road
[6:54] if we look to the right we look to the

[7:00] we'll will march that road brother frank
[7:03] amen god is certainly providing a
[7:05] wonderful way for us here in this end
[7:06] time
[7:07] and i know tonight if you're a believer
[7:09] in this message it's not because you
[7:10] dread it
[7:12] i don't believe it's because somebody's
[7:14] twisting your arm making you believe it
[7:17] but i believe if you're believing the
[7:18] end time message it's because you
[7:20] rejoice in your heart
[7:22] to be able to believe such a thing oh
[7:25] listen friend
[7:26] if you stop thinking about a minute the
[7:28] day you saw it how many million people
[7:30] was passed over
[7:32] the day you saw it the day i saw it how
[7:35] many million people was passed over
[7:37] so when you stop and think about it
[7:38] you're one in a million maybe one in two
[7:41] million
[7:42] all but what a privilege it is that god
[7:44] would let us believe and see
[7:45] and know the truth for this great hour
[7:47] that we're living in well if it's new to
[7:49] you
[7:50] if you'll stick around long enough
[7:51] you'll hear about it i'm sure because
[7:53] god is certainly moving in the earth in
[7:55] this great end time
[7:56] and to even be a part of it a little
[7:58] significant bunch of people that
[8:00] don't have a lot of wealth to their name
[8:02] a lot of nobodies more than anything
[8:04] but when you come right down to we are
[8:06] the body part of the body

[14:18] often here

[14:46] god bless you tonight brother bill
[14:48] appreciate you good to see you you know
[14:50] we know we

[14:53] believe part of that
[14:54] progressive revelation is the lord
[14:57] progressively
[14:58] revealing to us more and more day by day
[15:00] how really great he is and how each one
[15:02] of these
[15:02] needs he can meet seeing brother jim in
[15:05] the hospital and then see him out
[15:06] ah what a miracle knowing that god has
[15:08] done that he can do it again we just
[15:10] believe that
[15:11] heavenly father we stand here today lord
[15:14] with
[15:15] needs that are written out held between
[15:18] human fingers lord and
[15:19] there's not a bit of power there to be
[15:21] able to change a single situation
[15:24] but lord outside of that and looking
[15:27] over into the other dimension the other
[15:29] realm lord where
[15:30] all is so much more real than what we
[15:33] see here
[15:34] all power is given to us in the name of
[15:36] jesus christ
[15:38] and lord we know that every single need
[15:40] that
[15:41] has been written out everyone that's
[15:42] been testified to by the raising of the
[15:45] hand
[15:45] every one of them is well known in your
[15:47] sight lord jesus and
[15:49] sometimes i picture in my mind you
[15:51] standing there reaching out your hands
[15:53] to
[15:54] us longing for us to believe just a
[15:56] little more and that needle be met
[15:59] because lord we know it's on condition
[16:00] of our faith that you've already
[16:02] provided the way
[16:03] brother branham taught us you couldn't
[16:05] heal us if you were here but
[16:06] you already paid the price and it's up
[16:08] to us to reach out and claim it
[16:10] and to see brother jim lord to realize
[16:12] that he got to a place or maybe the
[16:14] situation was right whatever in your
[16:16] timing but they were
[16:17] able to reach out and claim and we see a
[16:19] manifestation
[16:20] lord we in this church have seen that
[16:22] over and over and over again
[16:24] we know you're alive we know your power
[16:27] is real we know you're here and you're
[16:28] present and you're able and you're
[16:30] willing
[16:30] but oh god help us tonight to to somehow
[16:33] take hold of the faith lord jesus to
[16:35] believe that each one of these needs
[16:37] will be met
[16:38] lord it would do our hearts good to
[16:39] realize that you have moved on the scene
[16:41] that we have reached out to you
[16:43] successfully and there would be
[16:44] testimony after testimony after
[16:46] testimony
[16:47] brought in and read before this
[16:48] congregation of what mighty things the
[16:50] lord god of heaven has done
[16:52] lord we know you're the same that you
[16:54] always were we know that this message
[16:56] has proclaimed that great scripture
[16:57] jesus christ the same yesterday and
[16:59] today and forever and we believe that
[17:00] lord
[17:01] we are some in this end time that stand
[17:03] upon that truth
[17:04] may we just claim it tonight for every
[17:06] need lord god
[17:07] move in a mighty way as you do over and
[17:10] over and may we be receptive
[17:12] may that the spirit of god have liberty
[17:14] tonight may you bless our pastor lord

[17:19] lips lord
[17:20] that we might receive truly and purely
[17:22] from you as you do so often

[19:29] for those who can
[19:31] to park on the hill and leave the lower
[19:33] parking lots for our visitors especially
[19:35] any of the young people that would be

[19:43] lots to the
[19:44] our senior citizens and and to our
[19:46] visitors please remember that
[19:49] also we would like for any volunteers
[19:53] this is on a volunteer basis only to sit
[19:56] in the fellowship hall with the large
[19:58] monitor
[19:58] to give room for visitors we know we
[20:01] have never asked this before but is
[20:03] only on a volunteer basis and for those
[20:05] who would think they could watch the
[20:06] services
[20:07] on the monitor and not be distracted by
[20:10] it or
[20:11] the location we realize not everyone
[20:13] would be able to go to the fellowship

[27:42] my burdens down
[27:46] i feel like singing
[27:49] just like singing since i'm laying my
[27:55] burdens down i feel like
[27:58] singing just
[28:14] since
[28:42] i'm feeling better
[28:45] so much better since i've laid
[28:49] my burdens down
[28:53] with glory glory
[28:56] hallelujah
[29:08] hallelujah since i'm laying my
[29:12] burdens down you lord jesus
[29:28] praise be to god how many feels better
[29:31] since you laid your burdens down let's
[29:34] turn tonight if you would to romans
[29:36] chapter nine
[29:37] brother michael i took the game down on
[29:40] the top left to probably take the slide
[29:41] up quite a bit more than normal
[29:45] romans chapter 9.
[29:49] instead of going back into the book of
[29:50] revelation tonight
[29:53] i didn't hardly get finished on choices
[29:55] we make
[29:57] so we'll look at that tonight
[30:00] if you don't mind and we're going to if
[30:03] you do so
[30:06] it'd probably just be good if you'd
[30:07] enjoy it because we're going to do it
[30:08] either way
[30:10] i felt felt in my heart that we should
[30:14] look at this while we're here i deem it
[30:16] very important myself
[30:19] when the lord leads us to go a certain
[30:21] direction
[30:23] romans chapter 9 verse 10
[30:28] not only this
[30:33] but when rebecca also had conceived by
[30:36] one even by our father isaac
[30:41] for the children being not yet born
[30:45] neither having done good any good or
[30:48] evil
[30:50] that the purpose of god according to
[30:52] election might stand
[30:55] not of works but of him that call us
[31:00] it was said unto her the elder
[31:04] shall serve the younger
[31:07] as it is written jacob
[31:11] have i loved but esau
[31:15] have i hated believes that's just
[31:20] if you understand it correctly it is
[31:22] [Music]
[31:24] jacob have i loved but esau have i hated
[31:27] what shall we say then
[31:30] is there unrighteousness with god
[31:35] god forbid for he saith to moses i will
[31:39] have mercy on whom i will have mercy
[31:42] and i will have compassion on whom i
[31:45] will have compassion
[31:48] so then it is not of him that will us
[31:52] nor of him that run us but of god
[31:57] that show us mercy for the scripture
[32:00] saith unto pharaoh even for this same
[32:03] purpose have i raised thee up
[32:05] that i might show my power in thee
[32:08] and that my name might be declared
[32:12] throughout all the earth let's bow our
[32:14] heads together
[32:18] lord jesus we counted a great privilege
[32:20] once again that we can gather here
[32:21] tonight
[32:24] realizing that we're a blessed people
[32:27] first of all to know you as our savior
[32:31] to be redeemed from the world of sin
[32:34] that we were born in
[32:35] what a privileged lord and then there's
[32:38] so many
[32:39] many more blessings that we could name
[32:44] a church to go to brothers and sisters
[32:47] that love us
[32:48] a message a prophet so many things lord
[32:52] you've done for us and we're grateful
[32:55] we pray tonight father that you would
[32:57] help us in this service
[32:59] may our hearts be enlightened to hear
[33:02] and understand the word of god
[33:04] in jesus name and the saints said
[33:08] may be seated
[33:12] you know it seems uh quite difficult
[33:16] when we go to looking
[33:17] at choices that we make and
[33:22] how much those choices might intervene
[33:25] in our lives and even the lives of other
[33:28] individuals
[33:30] and concerning our our destiny
[33:33] our choice our walk with god in life
[33:38] and so many things that we could look at
[33:41] that
[33:42] our choice is what determines so many
[33:45] things that happen to us
[33:47] and yet we believe that god before the
[33:50] foundation of the world
[33:51] knew every person that would ever be
[33:53] saved
[33:54] every person that would not be saved god
[33:57] knew ever
[33:58] fly ever flee every net
[34:01] every dog and every cat and god knew
[34:04] every human being
[34:06] god just knew it all but
[34:09] still god's providence of his divine
[34:12] sovereignty does not override
[34:16] us as human beings having a choice
[34:19] and as we looked at it this past weekend
[34:21] and realizing that
[34:23] the choices that we make in life can
[34:25] have such an effect on us and our family
[34:28] on our grandchildren on down on down on
[34:30] down
[34:31] because those choices can affect people
[34:34] for generations to come
[34:36] but we realize then that god by his
[34:39] grace
[34:40] could not justly ordain
[34:44] a man to go to hell
[34:47] ordain another man to go to heaven
[34:51] without first being justified
[34:54] in doing so now god could not
[34:58] by his own desire predestinate
[35:02] anyone to be saved or by his own desire
[35:06] predestinate anyone to be lost
[35:10] now don't get caught on me already i
[35:12] just got started
[35:14] but yet we know that god foreknew every
[35:17] creature that would ever have eternal
[35:19] life
[35:20] and we know that the book of life was
[35:22] written when
[35:23] the night you got saved before the
[35:25] foundation of the world
[35:28] so how could we reckon it all together
[35:31] well when we look at at free moral
[35:33] agency and we realize that the first
[35:35] beings that were given what we call
[35:39] free moral agency it was not man
[35:42] it was before man was created actually
[35:45] the first beings that were granted
[35:48] a free moral agency choice the right to
[35:51] choose
[35:52] were angels the first thing of god's
[35:55] creation that
[35:56] brought him into the attributes of being
[35:58] god
[35:59] was angels he was all alone no one there
[36:01] to worship him
[36:02] but the first thing that he made and
[36:04] created was angels and then
[36:06] they began to worship him but now notice
[36:09] god put them
[36:10] on the same basis that you and i are on
[36:13] tonight
[36:14] god did not create sin
[36:17] can you say amen to that sin is not
[36:20] a creation god did not
[36:24] create the devil as we know him tonight
[36:28] in his condition how did satan become
[36:33] from lucifer the original archangel of
[36:36] god
[36:37] the covering cherub of god how did he
[36:40] become
[36:41] from that to becoming the devil
[36:44] by free moral agency
[36:48] god could not have created this being
[36:51] to be the devil to be lucifer to be the
[36:55] originator of sin
[36:57] and then at the end time cause him force
[37:00] him
[37:01] commit him into a lake of fire and be
[37:04] just in doing so
[37:05] because had god created the devil as we
[37:08] know him today
[37:09] in his condition that he is right now
[37:12] then everything that he has done down
[37:14] through the ages
[37:15] would have only been acting out what he
[37:18] was predestinated to do
[37:20] but god by foreign knowledge could put
[37:23] him on the basis
[37:24] of making a choice and knowing what he
[37:26] would choose
[37:28] then god could foreordain and
[37:30] predestinate
[37:31] by his foreknowledge knowing that satan
[37:34] would do this
[37:34] but in order to be just he had to put
[37:37] him on the basis that you're standing on
[37:39] tonight
[37:40] are you hearing me i'm talking about
[37:43] choices that we make
[37:44] in life now before you ever made your
[37:48] choice
[37:49] before i ever made mine before all the
[37:52] mortals that are living here
[37:54] before a free moral agency was ever
[37:56] exercised in the human race
[37:57] it was exercise and angelic beings let
[38:00] me just prove that to you that day on
[38:01] calvary
[38:02] the prophet says that this way sin did
[38:04] not start on the earth
[38:05] sin started in heaven lucifer the devil
[38:09] was a condemned creature for
[38:10] his disobedience before he ever struck
[38:13] the earth
[38:14] sin began in heaven where god put the
[38:18] angels
[38:18] on the same basis that he put the human
[38:22] being now if god could be just
[38:25] and condemning people to hell without
[38:28] giving them a choice
[38:29] amen without giving them a choice around
[38:32] a free moral agency
[38:34] then god could have created satan to be
[38:37] the evil
[38:38] corrupt fallen creature that he is he
[38:40] could have made satan to be
[38:42] evil unrighteous impure degradated all
[38:46] the things that the devil is then god
[38:48] could have done the same thing to the
[38:50] devil
[38:50] and been absolutely justified in doing
[38:53] so but you see
[38:54] god never created satan in the condition
[38:58] that we know him today
[38:59] the very reason that satan is the devil
[39:02] today
[39:03] is because by his own choice he chose to
[39:07] leave the realms of the holy presence of
[39:10] god
[39:10] he chose to leave his position as
[39:14] overshadowing the word and he chose to
[39:17] become an
[39:18] enemy against god amen
[39:22] now watch this he says oh my he said he
[39:25] put the angels on the same basis
[39:28] that he put them on now the tree of
[39:30] knowledge in the tree of life
[39:31] is before every human being and when
[39:34] lucifer was given the preeminence to
[39:36] make
[39:37] his choice he wanted something better
[39:40] than god had
[39:42] and that is where the trouble started
[39:44] now he said how i disagree
[39:46] with the universalists that say satan
[39:48] will be saved
[39:50] he sinned and he is the originator
[39:53] of sin his soul sinned and he will be
[39:57] totally annihilated now it was not that
[40:00] satan was
[40:01] created sin you follow me so far god
[40:04] cannot create sin because whatever comes
[40:08] out of god's being
[40:10] whatever that god creates is a part
[40:13] of his own being now if god could create
[40:16] sin then out of a holy righteous pure
[40:19] god
[40:19] would have to be an attribute inside of
[40:22] him
[40:23] which would be sin if god could create
[40:25] light then
[40:26] in him had to be an attribute of life if
[40:29] god created
[40:30] righteousness and in him had to be the
[40:32] attribute of righteousness so if god
[40:34] created sin then there had to be an
[40:37] attribute
[40:38] inside of god because every man
[40:41] is known by the product the product that
[40:43] he produces so as we look as the
[40:45] creation of god
[40:46] and we see the creation of god is only
[40:49] reflection
[40:50] of the product of the one who produced
[40:52] it so if evil come out of god
[40:54] sin come out of god if god created the
[40:57] devil and the way we know him today
[40:59] then brother sister i want you to look
[41:01] what we have attributed to our heavenly
[41:03] father
[41:04] we have attributed into him to be an
[41:07] attribute of evil
[41:08] an attribute of lying an attribute of
[41:10] death an
[41:11] attribute of sickness but sin is not a
[41:14] creation
[41:15] sin is a perversion and the first one
[41:19] that made the perversion
[41:21] was the devil himself on what basis
[41:24] freeball agency
[41:25] [Applause]
[41:28] choices we make you see it was not god
[41:34] that chose satan in that way he knew he
[41:37] would now foreign
[41:39] simply declares that god knew what would
[41:41] be
[41:42] and by for knowledge god could
[41:44] predestinate
[41:45] now what made satan any different on all
[41:48] the rest of the angels and yet the bible
[41:49] tells us in timothy
[41:50] that there were elect angels but all of
[41:53] those angels were put on the basis
[41:55] to where they could choose to remain
[41:57] with the word remain with christ or
[41:59] leave with lucifer which at that time
[42:02] was not the devil
[42:03] satan actually become the devil after
[42:06] his choice
[42:07] do you realize that people who hear the
[42:09] word of god and choose to go on and cut
[42:12] their hair
[42:12] paint their face live a wicked light
[42:15] don't you realize
[42:16] it is by their own choice expressed and
[42:19] they will get worse and worse and worse
[42:21] look at the devil
[42:22] at one time living in the presence of
[42:24] god and god did not
[42:26] create evil and put it in him and
[42:29] pre-program it as a software as it was
[42:32] on certain certain day in a certain
[42:34] certain month in a certain certain year
[42:36] this thing would kick in if that was
[42:38] created and put in the devil
[42:40] then you have got god being the creator
[42:43] of sin
[42:44] the creator of evil god did not put that
[42:47] in him
[42:48] he put him on the basis of choice
[42:51] and when the devil made his ultimate
[42:53] choice he chose sin
[42:55] he chose unbelief
[42:58] it was not god that chose that for the
[43:00] devil the devil chose it himself
[43:03] now watch his sin is not a christian
[43:05] i'll prove that to you manifested sons
[43:07] of god
[43:07] he said there was never such a thing as
[43:10] the creation of sin
[43:12] oh he said that didn't go down too good
[43:15] he said sin
[43:16] is not a creation no sir sin
[43:19] is a perversion
[43:25] god did not create sin
[43:29] sin was brought on the basis of free
[43:32] moral agency
[43:34] there's only one creator sin is
[43:36] righteous as perverted what is in
[43:38] adultery
[43:39] righteousness perverted truth
[43:40] misrepresented certainly what is a
[43:42] cursed word
[43:43] god's blessings turned around but he
[43:45] said sin is not a creation
[43:47] it is a perversion
[43:50] so if we have god being the author or
[43:53] the creator
[43:54] of sin that friend i don't mind telling
[43:57] you i think i'll stop
[43:58] serving him tonight
[44:02] because how do i know when we get up
[44:04] there at heaven more of that evil won't
[44:06] be expressed again
[44:08] if god created sin and if god created
[44:11] evil
[44:12] how do you know you go through all this
[44:14] life living for god
[44:15] and then you get there to heaven and god
[44:17] decides this evil street's going to come
[44:19] out of it again
[44:20] nonsense god is not evil
[44:24] are you hearing me praise the lord now
[44:26] what she said sin is not a creation
[44:28] there's nothing created
[44:30] but perfection now watch a man is known
[44:34] by his work so
[44:35] when god created lucifer what was he
[44:39] perfection
[44:43] does that bother you it's the truth when
[44:46] god created all the angels what were
[44:48] they
[44:49] perfect holy sinless righteous
[44:52] pure undefiled will you say how in the
[44:55] world have we got all this mess today
[44:57] by the free moral agency of one angel
[45:02] he made his choice
[45:05] oh praise the lord how many believes
[45:07] it's the truth
[45:09] now watch he said there's nothing that
[45:11] was created but perfection
[45:13] god created all things good and sin is
[45:18] not a creation
[45:20] he said god could not create sin
[45:23] because there's nothing in him to make
[45:26] it
[45:28] but now where did it come from the whole
[45:30] earth is filled with unbelief and
[45:32] darkness and all kinds of
[45:34] things that we wouldn't even want to
[45:35] talk about where did it come from
[45:38] did it come from the creation it came
[45:40] from a perversion
[45:42] god gave the original word and then this
[45:45] angel by his choice
[45:47] this angel made a choice down your nurse
[45:51] up there in heaven
[45:52] [Applause]
[45:55] oh my how many believes man is put on
[45:58] the same basis
[46:00] three moral agents oh brother dania i
[46:03] didn't have no choice and you got god
[46:04] being unjust
[46:06] you got god putting the devil on one
[46:08] basis god putting adam and eve on one
[46:10] basis
[46:11] god putting you on another
[46:14] praise the lord but brother donny what
[46:17] about all the seed gene and all that
[46:18] stuff
[46:19] it's still true all that i preached see
[46:21] on all that
[46:22] it's still true but this is true as well
[46:24] [Applause]
[46:26] now what man is on the basis of freedom
[46:28] all agency
[46:30] god could not
[46:33] take a man and say
[46:37] i'm going to make you do this and i'm
[46:39] going to make you be a lost man and i'm
[46:42] gonna
[46:42] make you be a saved man that would be
[46:46] that wouldn't be the nature of
[46:49] god amen you say why is it important
[46:53] i'll tell you why it's important
[46:55] because if you believe that god made a
[46:57] man to be lost
[46:59] and made another man to be a saved man
[47:02] you've got the nature of your father
[47:03] twisted around
[47:06] you're not looking at him right you're
[47:08] believing
[47:09] something about your father that is not
[47:12] the truth
[47:13] and it'll start there and it'll reflect
[47:16] itself on down the road
[47:17] somewhere else keep on going until it
[47:19] becomes a snowball in your life
[47:21] to where you finally get to a place that
[47:24] god will seem evil
[47:26] now listen to this friend if you want to
[47:28] mark this out it's of course it's just
[47:29] up to you
[47:31] but now he said god could not take a man
[47:33] and say
[47:34] i'm going to make you do this i'm going
[47:37] to make you be
[47:38] lost i'm going to make you be saved
[47:41] that wouldn't be the nature of god
[47:46] now he said he's not willing that any
[47:48] should perish
[47:50] he wants all to repent but he
[47:53] knew from the beginning who would perish
[47:56] and who would not bear us hallelujah
[48:00] hallelujah
[48:02] now watch he said he's not willing that
[48:04] it would be that way
[48:07] it was not that god said i hate this man
[48:10] i love this man i hate this woman i love
[48:12] this woman
[48:12] i hate this man i love that man you're
[48:14] my seed you're not my seed amy meany
[48:16] mighty mole
[48:18] no how could a just god do such a thing
[48:20] as that
[48:25] praise the lord he's not willing
[48:29] that it would be that way he wants all
[48:32] to come back to him but he knows who
[48:36] will
[48:38] and who what so by for
[48:41] knowledge he can make everything work
[48:44] according to his plan you understand
[48:48] now was talking about adam and eve he
[48:50] could not
[48:51] what she said he could not make them
[48:53] follow he let them get out there and
[48:54] free moral agency
[48:56] he could not make them do it
[49:01] no more than he could make the devil do
[49:03] it
[49:04] no more than he can make you do it
[49:07] you know why you go to hell because you
[49:10] want to
[49:13] oh the devil made me do it i'll tell you
[49:16] one thing both god and the devil are
[49:18] blamed for a lot of things neither one
[49:20] of them do
[49:20] [Applause]
[49:22] we blame god for a bunch of them when
[49:24] that don't work out we blame the devil
[49:26] as much as i hate that poor old sorry
[49:28] outfit he's blamed for a lot of stuff he
[49:30] just don't do
[49:32] a lot of it comes back to us oh i want
[49:36] to i want to do right i want to do this
[49:38] if you wanted to brother there wouldn't
[49:40] be enough devils out of hell to stop you
[49:42] but the bottom line is people don't want
[49:45] to do it
[49:46] they blame god or there's too many
[49:48] hypocrites in the church
[49:49] i ain't going to see the hypocrites i'm
[49:51] going to see jesus
[49:54] [Applause]
[49:54] [Music]
[49:56] you don't let that stop him from going
[49:58] to walmart do you
[50:00] you sure shouldn't let it stop you from
[50:01] coming to the house of god
[50:04] praise the lord amen now he said he
[50:08] could make him do it
[50:10] and be just but he could put him on free
[50:13] moral agency
[50:15] and let them do it themselves and he
[50:18] knew all the time they would
[50:21] but whose choice was it whose choice
[50:25] whose choice was it that the world got
[50:28] in the condition that it was in
[50:29] the choice of man
[50:33] god foreknew it
[50:36] but god did not make adam do it
[50:40] oh you say i want to go to heaven so bad
[50:42] i love the lord so bad but i'm afraid
[50:44] god won't let me go in you have to be
[50:46] contrary to god's nature
[50:48] if you love god with all your heart all
[50:50] your soul all your mind and your
[50:52] strength
[50:52] i'm not talking about loving god from
[50:54] your spirit now i'm talking about loving
[50:56] god from your soul
[50:58] he saw that in you before the foundation
[51:00] of the world
[51:04] now watch this he says he could not make
[51:08] sin because he's righteous
[51:11] and the father of righteousness could
[51:13] not make sin
[51:14] so you know what he done he made man in
[51:17] his own image
[51:18] knowing that he would fall and he put
[51:21] him on the basis of freemore agency
[51:23] now he said don't touch this tree but he
[51:25] knew that man would fail
[51:27] but yet he couldn't make man do it
[51:29] himself
[51:30] he had to let man do it and then when
[51:33] man did it
[51:34] he was able to pick him up and make
[51:36] himself savior
[51:38] praise be to god but now he could not
[51:40] make the man do it
[51:41] and then dwarven pick him up and say i'm
[51:44] your savior but he put him on the basis
[51:46] and he knew the man would do it
[51:49] choices we make
[51:53] oh praise the lord
[51:56] but brother donnie there's some people
[51:58] foreign to this condemnation that's
[52:00] exactly right
[52:01] that's right how how were they for
[52:04] ordained
[52:06] choices choices
[52:09] god foresaw
[52:14] i know this is tough on some of you but
[52:16] you better listen
[52:18] it's coming from the same message and we
[52:19] get all the other quotes from too in the
[52:21] same scriptures
[52:22] god listen to this he asked a question
[52:26] god make a man sin
[52:31] so he could punish him no
[52:34] he says no
[52:38] god make these people you're in johnson
[52:40] city make them to be perverts
[52:43] make them to be liars make him to be
[52:45] perverted in all sorts of manner
[52:47] so he can have somebody to take out his
[52:49] judgment on
[52:50] friend what kind of god are you serving
[52:54] you need to get the god of john 3 16.
[52:58] for god's so loved the bride
[53:02] they let the godly people
[53:05] look at the word in the original greek
[53:07] god so loved the cosmos
[53:15] oh brother dawning god saw that i was so
[53:17] good yeah
[53:18] right you're good all right you're good
[53:19] for nothing
[53:22] one for the grace of god i'll tell you
[53:24] what we'd be worse than a bunch of hogs
[53:25] walling around and sin
[53:28] that's right no he says god plays the
[53:31] first man adam and eve right here in the
[53:33] freemore agency
[53:34] and he places you the same way we say
[53:37] how does that kind of god's
[53:38] predestinated will right here it is
[53:40] friend
[53:41] and the only way you can ever get this
[53:43] thing fixed
[53:45] is your own self-will you have to will
[53:49] to do his will
[53:57] oh you said the number of the donut
[53:58] listen the scripture tells us god is not
[54:01] willing it is not the will of god
[54:04] that any human being go to hell
[54:08] [Music]
[54:09] who was hell created for who
[54:14] well how's humans going there choices
[54:17] we make in life
[54:20] he's not willing that any should perish
[54:22] but that all
[54:24] should come to repentance oh why don't
[54:25] they do it they choose
[54:27] not to
[54:29] [Applause]
[54:32] praise the lord saints oh you're saying
[54:35] hey brother don
[54:36] this confuses me it ain't been but
[54:39] probably three four weeks ago that you
[54:40] preached about you're reflecting where
[54:42] you're from that's right
[54:43] you said judas was born the son of
[54:45] perdition that's right
[54:47] you said he come from hell that's right
[54:50] and he went back to hell that's right
[54:52] but what part of judas come from hell
[54:56] the prophet of god tells us that same
[54:57] quote if you'd been listening that i
[54:59] read to you three weeks ago
[55:01] you'd have heard the god's prophet said
[55:03] the spirit that was on judas
[55:05] was what come from hell the spirit of
[55:08] judas was the antichrist it was not the
[55:10] body of judas that come from hell
[55:12] that went back to hell you say judas had
[55:15] a free moral agency if he didn't god was
[55:18] unjust
[55:19] [Music]
[55:23] hallelujah y'all with me
[55:27] okay i just want to make sure y'all want
[55:29] walmart or somewhere shopping
[55:32] donny judas absolutely matthew 27
[55:36] 3 then judas which had betrayed when he
[55:38] saw
[55:39] he was condemned repented himself and
[55:42] brought again the 30 pieces of silver to
[55:44] the chief priests and elders
[55:46] saying i have
[55:50] sinned not god
[55:54] made me do this i
[55:57] have sinned amen he once said our god
[56:02] should ever give me a chance
[56:04] he knew he made the choice
[56:07] and god foresaw that choice before the
[56:10] foundation of the world
[56:11] and god needed somebody that would play
[56:14] out that part and he saw what judas
[56:17] would do
[56:18] and when judas built the womb he earned
[56:21] the identification of the son
[56:23] of perdition by god's choice
[56:28] judas
[56:40] what did judas do he says what did he do
[56:44] he doubted christ's claims after he
[56:47] started to walk with him now you see
[56:49] many people get the idea
[56:50] that judas loved god with all of his
[56:52] heart oh he wanted to go to heaven he
[56:55] wanted to be right he wanted to do right
[56:57] but god said jesus i hate you
[57:00] and i'm not going to let you come to my
[57:02] heaven
[57:07] god never said that at all but god
[57:10] did foresee what judas would choose
[57:14] he needed a judas he needed a pharaoh
[57:18] he needed an esau but how could he use
[57:21] them
[57:22] if he pre-programmed him to do it and
[57:25] then them fall and obey exactly look for
[57:27] it look at it and write
[57:29] if a man is ordained of god to be a
[57:32] sinner
[57:33] and a man fulfills that part of being a
[57:35] sinner
[57:36] how can god throw him in hell and then
[57:38] god ordains another man to be a son of
[57:41] god
[57:41] and that man fulfills god's will too
[57:44] have not both of them done it
[57:48] amen then the center man is in the will
[57:51] of god
[57:52] just as much as you holy roller children
[57:54] are
[57:58] praise the lord the longer i preach more
[58:02] confused for some of y'all look
[58:05] [Music]
[58:07] if a man is living this life a sinner
[58:10] in the will of god how can god come up
[58:12] and say you didn't do what i told you
[58:14] yes i did god i drunk i lied i committed
[58:17] adultery i raped women i murdered i
[58:19] robbed banks i stole that's what you
[58:21] ordained me to be
[58:24] [Music]
[58:27] they're going to have to say well come
[58:29] on in you obeyed my word to the letter
[58:31] you feel my you fulfill my word there's
[58:33] so many sons of god over here
[58:35] i mean they complained about doing their
[58:37] will you didn't you got drunk you
[58:38] enjoyed it
[58:39] you lied you enjoyed it you stole you
[58:42] enjoyed it
[58:43] some other sons on this other side they
[58:45] growled and complained and crumbled and
[58:47] carried out
[58:51] is anybody in your sin daylight tonight
[58:55] now watch this judas doubted
[58:59] christ claims
[59:03] how could god say about this man you're
[59:05] the son of perdition
[59:07] he foresaw he said they'll never be
[59:10] nested in him
[59:12] and he actually put him on a basis to
[59:15] where he could follow jesus
[59:17] and from his soul make the choice
[59:22] i don't believe this this man
[59:25] is not right just like people who follow
[59:27] this message
[59:29] many of them start out oh my this is a
[59:31] prophet of god oh my this is the message
[59:33] there and then they go to finding things
[59:35] that
[59:35] don't line up with their old baptist
[59:37] theology or their old pentecostal
[59:39] theology
[59:40] you know what i begin to wonder about
[59:41] this message now i don't know now
[59:43] some of them quotes i tell one thing i
[59:45] can't make it line up with the scripture
[59:46] i didn't know you're supposed to you not
[59:48] head
[59:50] god never sent you to straighten out no
[59:51] prophet of god if i remember right
[59:53] he sent a prophet to god to straighten
[59:55] you out
[59:55] [Applause]
[59:58] everybody
[1:00:02] hello and judah started out that way
[1:00:07] but because he had a choice and he made
[1:00:11] that
[1:00:11] choice and what those fallen angels
[1:00:14] christian answers on hebrews 9
[1:00:16] those fallen angels that fell from the
[1:00:18] original the state of god
[1:00:19] those spirits come and influence people
[1:00:22] on the earth
[1:00:23] then those angels that remain in the
[1:00:25] presence of god
[1:00:26] those spirits come and influence people
[1:00:28] and by the choice that you surrender to
[1:00:30] us which one you're under the influence
[1:00:32] of
[1:00:32] [Applause]
[1:00:36] choices we make
[1:00:40] well if i'm ordained i'll be there
[1:00:42] hallelujah
[1:00:44] i'm going to sin a little bit and smoke
[1:00:46] a little bit and run around
[1:00:48] smoke a little dope take a little crack
[1:00:51] but i'm ordained hallelujah one of these
[1:00:54] days gotta get a hold of me
[1:00:56] god don't shake me it ain't no wonder we
[1:00:58] got so many baptists around this message
[1:01:00] and presbyterian
[1:01:02] by the way some of them preach
[1:01:03] predestination you take the whole choice
[1:01:05] away
[1:01:06] and they got it in their mind it's like
[1:01:08] some kind of time bomb that's clear
[1:01:10] well if i'm a son god will break my leg
[1:01:12] break my nose i don't do something
[1:01:19] [Music]
[1:01:23] god can't even heal you over your will
[1:01:26] much less save you
[1:01:29] that is quotes
[1:01:33] god wants you to be healed god wants you
[1:01:36] to prosper
[1:01:37] and be in health is that the word how
[1:01:40] come some of you folks sick tonight
[1:01:45] god's want you to prosper is that the
[1:01:47] word
[1:01:48] i wish above all things that thou would
[1:01:50] has prosper
[1:01:51] and be in health even as thy soul
[1:01:53] prosper how come they got sick folks
[1:01:56] that's god's will your will is you'd
[1:01:58] rather be sick
[1:01:59] or you don't take care of yourself one
[1:02:02] praise the lord brother donny preach
[1:02:04] i'm gonna come over here one day make me
[1:02:05] an amen tape and i'm going to set it
[1:02:07] right back here
[1:02:08] and i'm going to say it in different
[1:02:10] voices amen amen
[1:02:12] amen
[1:02:16] and about every 10 minutes i'll just
[1:02:17] turn that thing on
[1:02:21] [Applause]
[1:02:25] so the folks that get these tapes we'll
[1:02:27] think everybody who's dead
[1:02:30] [Applause]
[1:02:33] hallelujah my my
[1:02:37] the prophet said what made judas turn
[1:02:40] he actually doubted the claims of christ
[1:02:44] being the word but now see we've got to
[1:02:47] remind many of us
[1:02:49] that one day judas is just walking along
[1:02:51] and his spiritual
[1:02:52] predestinated condemnation software
[1:02:55] kicked in one day he says
[1:03:07] [Music]
[1:03:09] no maybe there's one little thing jesus
[1:03:13] started saying
[1:03:14] and questions started flashing up then
[1:03:17] another
[1:03:18] then another it was not that there was
[1:03:20] some kind of spiritual
[1:03:21] software pre-programmed in his soul that
[1:03:23] he had no choice he
[1:03:25] had a choice just like you do
[1:03:31] oh at this certain time i just know at
[1:03:33] this certain time
[1:03:34] god's ordained a certain time for me to
[1:03:36] be set free many of you could be set
[1:03:38] free the very hour you want deliverance
[1:03:40] but you've got it in your mind that is
[1:03:42] programmed of god
[1:03:44] ordained of god i've got to go out here
[1:03:45] and live a wild life
[1:03:47] so i can know what it means to be saved
[1:03:49] that's a lie
[1:03:51] the prophet of god said i would have
[1:03:53] given my heart to the lord
[1:03:54] as a little boy but there was a dark
[1:03:56] shadow that hung over me
[1:03:59] [Music]
[1:03:59] [Applause]
[1:04:05] choices choices
[1:04:09] we make now can we go a little farther
[1:04:14] thank you let's look at this for
[1:04:15] knowledge now
[1:04:17] the brother said god actually made
[1:04:19] creatures and creatures failed then god
[1:04:21] by his infancy looked down through the
[1:04:24] stream of time and saw
[1:04:26] every man that would be saved
[1:04:29] every man he knew it before knowledge
[1:04:31] therefore by
[1:04:32] for knowledge he knew who would be saved
[1:04:37] and who would not be saved therefore
[1:04:40] he could pre-destinate
[1:04:45] by choice no i desire no by
[1:04:48] foreknowledge
[1:04:49] [Applause]
[1:04:51] amen you see he said it's not such a bad
[1:04:54] word after all is it
[1:04:55] he could predestinate because he knew
[1:04:59] who would and who would not
[1:05:03] god bias for knowledge seen exactly
[1:05:07] who would be saved and who wouldn't be
[1:05:09] saved
[1:05:10] and he sent jesus to save those he had
[1:05:13] already chosen
[1:05:14] [Music]
[1:05:16] praise be to god
[1:05:22] my brother donnie wait a minute if i had
[1:05:24] a choice and god had a choice
[1:05:26] what's the order of the choices who
[1:05:29] chose first me or god
[1:05:37] i'm going to answer i'm just going to
[1:05:38] leave it hanging for you
[1:05:40] you may get it though now what's that
[1:05:43] god now listen to this friend this is
[1:05:45] why it's important you've got the
[1:05:46] prophet of god making a direct statement
[1:05:48] something god could not do
[1:05:50] and yet some of you believe this very
[1:05:51] thing he said god could not do
[1:05:54] god could not say
[1:05:57] i'll take you and send you to hell
[1:06:02] and i'll take you and send you to heaven
[1:06:08] now look this ain't my words i'm reading
[1:06:10] to you statements from the message
[1:06:12] your message god could not say
[1:06:16] i'll take and send you to hell and i'll
[1:06:18] take and send you to heaven
[1:06:22] and you see why this is important that
[1:06:23] if you are telling people hey god looked
[1:06:25] at this man and said you're going to
[1:06:26] hell you're believing something bad
[1:06:27] about god
[1:06:29] you're attributing something evil into
[1:06:31] god's nature
[1:06:33] [Music]
[1:06:36] god wanted you both
[1:06:39] to go to heaven
[1:06:46] praise be to god but by for
[1:06:50] knowledge he knew which one of you would
[1:06:53] be a shyster
[1:06:55] and the other one would be a gentleman
[1:06:56] and a christian
[1:07:00] therefore he had to send jesus to die
[1:07:03] to save that man that he foreknew
[1:07:07] wanted to be saved
[1:07:11] oh hallelujah hallelujah but brother
[1:07:14] donnie i i thought you read dustin
[1:07:16] brother brown told us in 1965
[1:07:18] when a little baby was born that little
[1:07:19] seed was in him yes but how was it there
[1:07:22] before knowledge that makes it just
[1:07:29] praise be to god now listen to this
[1:07:32] he's not willing that and he should
[1:07:34] perish
[1:07:35] but he's for knowledge let him know who
[1:07:38] would and who when this friend there's
[1:07:39] not just a few quotes on this
[1:07:41] you'll find this through the entirety of
[1:07:43] the whole message
[1:07:44] you'll find it from 47 to 65.
[1:07:50] the holy spirit come to seal into the
[1:07:52] body the wife of jesus christ that he
[1:07:54] foreknew before the foundation of the
[1:07:56] world
[1:07:56] you see being god in for knowledge he
[1:07:59] could receive who would receive him
[1:08:02] and who would not
[1:08:05] so the holy spirit come to get that
[1:08:08] bride amen amen
[1:08:12] i love this right here he says election
[1:08:16] looks back to foreknowledge
[1:08:20] and predestination looks to destiny
[1:08:24] election looks back not to choice
[1:08:29] not to desire not to will but election
[1:08:33] looks
[1:08:33] back to foreknowledge and predestination
[1:08:37] looks
[1:08:38] to destiny get this out of your mind oh
[1:08:42] i love god with all of my heart oh i
[1:08:44] want to go to heaven but god won't let
[1:08:45] me go get that devil out of your mind
[1:08:48] if you want to go to heaven and you love
[1:08:49] god with all your heart
[1:08:51] there ain't nothing can stop you from
[1:08:53] going he wants you there
[1:08:56] where do you think you got that desire
[1:08:58] he wanted you to have that desire
[1:09:00] [Applause]
[1:09:03] praise god a long time ago he
[1:09:06] says god foresaw
[1:09:09] that i would love him
[1:09:12] [Music]
[1:09:15] hallelujah so he made a perpetuation
[1:09:18] through his own son
[1:09:20] that i might become from a cocklebur
[1:09:23] to a grain of wheat
[1:09:28] some of you you probably remember when
[1:09:29] you were younger
[1:09:31] maybe you ran out here in the world and
[1:09:33] done many evil things
[1:09:35] but the lord dealt with you maybe when
[1:09:36] you as a teenager maybe when you was
[1:09:38] much younger than when you actually gave
[1:09:40] your heart to god
[1:09:41] and now you know many people say well i
[1:09:43] just wasn't ordained to come in at that
[1:09:45] time
[1:09:45] oh friend i'll tell you one thing if you
[1:09:47] look back now and realize there might
[1:09:49] have been many many things you would
[1:09:50] have spared yourself
[1:09:52] had you come to god when the holy spirit
[1:09:54] was drawing you
[1:09:55] many of us have lost precious years in
[1:09:57] our life because we fooled around on god
[1:10:00] we played around in this message instead
[1:10:02] of getting serious and sincere
[1:10:04] because somehow we think one day my
[1:10:06] software is going to kick him
[1:10:08] and i'm going to be delivered to this
[1:10:09] and this and this nonsense
[1:10:11] god wants you to be free and delivered
[1:10:14] by the power of the world
[1:10:15] he's putting it right in your life
[1:10:17] [Applause]
[1:10:21] he's waiting for you to rise and say
[1:10:23] it's my life
[1:10:25] victory peace power's mine
[1:10:30] but satan's got a side tract and we're

[1:12:50] it written out right here before
[1:12:51] [Music]
[1:12:56] praise the lord nah
[1:13:00] my voice is good and it
[1:13:04] the holy spirit come to seal into the
[1:13:06] body the wife of jesus you believe that
[1:13:09] absolutely now watch this he said now
[1:13:12] predestinate it
[1:13:14] isn't i'll choose brother neville and i
[1:13:18] i i won't choose brother beeler
[1:13:22] that isn't it
[1:13:25] [Music]
[1:13:26] that's not predestination
[1:13:30] it's for knowledge that knew which one
[1:13:33] would be right
[1:13:35] that's predestined well you said brother
[1:13:37] daniels before the seals well how about
[1:13:38] one out of the seals
[1:13:40] first seal page 125 the lamb and the
[1:13:44] time of intercessory
[1:13:46] he knew that there was names that was
[1:13:47] put in that book from the foundation of
[1:13:49] the world
[1:13:50] and as long as them names have never
[1:13:52] been manifested on the earth yet
[1:13:54] he used to stay there as an intercessor
[1:13:56] do you get it
[1:13:58] perfectly predestination all right now
[1:14:00] by
[1:14:01] his for knowledge he saw them
[1:14:05] not by his will
[1:14:08] his will was that none should perish
[1:14:12] but by his foreknowledge he knew who
[1:14:14] would and who would not
[1:14:17] why christ speak i firmly believe the
[1:14:20] foreknowledge of god
[1:14:21] not that god is willing that any should
[1:14:23] perish but all
[1:14:25] should come to repentance praise be to
[1:14:30] god
[1:14:30] he had to know he knew the end from the
[1:14:33] beginning and see if he doesn't then he
[1:14:35] isn't infinite
[1:14:36] so he wasn't willing that any should
[1:14:39] perish
[1:14:40] but he knew who would and who would not
[1:14:43] now he said the very reason that jesus
[1:14:46] came to the
[1:14:47] earth was to save those that god
[1:14:50] through his foreknowledge saul wanted to
[1:14:54] be
[1:14:55] saved how many want to be saved
[1:15:00] [Applause]
[1:15:03] now if that was truth when you raised
[1:15:04] your hand god saw you before the
[1:15:06] foundation of the word
[1:15:08] put your name on his book and when you
[1:15:11] come to this earth there's a seed of
[1:15:12] representation down inside of you
[1:15:17] how though by for knowledge
[1:15:21] now watch this oh praise god he's seen
[1:15:24] those that wanted to be saved
[1:15:26] because the whole world was condemned i
[1:15:28] don't see how you can teach it any other
[1:15:30] way than the foreknowledge of god now if
[1:15:32] you teach predestination whether in the
[1:15:34] four knowledge of god you're teaching it
[1:15:36] wrong
[1:15:38] amen by far knowledge he could
[1:15:41] predestinate superc
[1:15:42] super sign november 63 not
[1:15:45] by his desire not
[1:15:49] by his desire i love this one i hate
[1:15:52] that one i want this one don't want that
[1:15:53] one you would have god predestinated by
[1:15:56] his desire
[1:15:57] which would mean god was evil
[1:16:06] god doesn't predestinate
[1:16:11] by his desire
[1:16:15] [Music]
[1:16:19] so all these millions of people that
[1:16:21] come up before the throne of god
[1:16:23] that have lived through time billions i
[1:16:25] should say
[1:16:26] every one of them will receive a just
[1:16:28] judgment
[1:16:31] it will not be that god predetermined
[1:16:34] their destiny without ever giving them a
[1:16:36] choice
[1:16:36] but god foresaw what they would choose
[1:16:39] god knew
[1:16:40] exactly what they would do when the
[1:16:41] gospel was preached to them
[1:16:43] and they will stand there living their
[1:16:45] life out as a sinner
[1:16:46] knowing that they received a one day a
[1:16:48] call on their heart
[1:16:49] the spirit of god dealt with them in
[1:16:51] order to be just he's got to deal with
[1:16:53] them that way
[1:16:54] and they turn down that call and justly
[1:16:56] god can say depart from me you work of
[1:16:59] iniquity i
[1:17:00] never knew you
[1:17:04] you chose where you're going
[1:17:09] praise the lord saints my my
[1:17:13] god knows who will and who won't so
[1:17:16] therefore he can predestinate
[1:17:18] he's not willing that any should perish
[1:17:23] well don't you've read some of the same
[1:17:24] things right and i'm going to read some
[1:17:25] more too
[1:17:27] because i want you to realize this is
[1:17:28] not just something hatched out in one or
[1:17:30] two quotes and put together
[1:17:31] there's hundreds of places we must pull
[1:17:34] it together friends
[1:17:36] you'll find in any doctrine it's easier
[1:17:39] to believe it this way
[1:17:41] or this way the hardest part of any
[1:17:44] truth
[1:17:45] is right here the human mind
[1:17:49] will catch it quicker here or there
[1:17:53] but it takes revelation to stand here
[1:17:56] it takes prayer it takes study and
[1:17:59] sometimes it takes commitment of saying
[1:18:02] god i just can't tie it together
[1:18:04] but people who lean over this way they
[1:18:06] can explain it almost down to the letter
[1:18:08] people who lean over this way can
[1:18:09] explain it almost down to the letter
[1:18:11] but people who stand in the middle they
[1:18:13] rely on god they can't rely on their own
[1:18:15] understanding their own knowledge well i
[1:18:17] don't understand this and
[1:18:18] don't understand that but somehow it all
[1:18:21] has got to come together
[1:18:27] praise god hallelujah we're going to the
[1:18:30] father
[1:18:33] all right now watch this
[1:18:36] he predestinated us this is proving his
[1:18:39] word in 1964
[1:18:41] unto the adoption of children by jesus
[1:18:43] christ
[1:18:44] god did not say i'll choose you
[1:18:49] and don't choose you friends i want to
[1:18:53] know
[1:18:54] how come some of y'all believe he did
[1:19:00] amen
[1:19:06] god didn't say that
[1:19:13] but his foreknowledge knowed what you
[1:19:15] would do
[1:19:18] hallelujah praise be to god
[1:19:22] because that's the way he predestinates
[1:19:27] by for knowledge not that he desired
[1:19:31] that this person be saved and this one
[1:19:33] be lost but he knew who would be
[1:19:36] lost and who would be saved therefore by
[1:19:39] his
[1:19:39] foreknowledge he can predestinate
[1:19:42] harvest time 1964.
[1:19:44] seeds not here 65. god knew before the
[1:19:47] foundation of the world
[1:19:48] who would be saved and who knew would
[1:19:50] not be saved by predestination by
[1:19:52] foreknowledge he saw every member and
[1:19:56] put your name on the lamb's book of life
[1:19:58] before the foundation of the world
[1:19:59] and jesus come to seek that which was on
[1:20:01] the book
[1:20:04] be to god how by foreknowledge
[1:20:08] amen trying to do god of service but god
[1:20:11] so has his word said in all ages
[1:20:13] his foreknowledge has caused him to set
[1:20:17] it in the church
[1:20:18] and in the people certain things that he
[1:20:19] did from the beginning and he only would
[1:20:21] be revealed to those certain people
[1:20:23] the rest of them won't see it that's
[1:20:26] predestination
[1:20:27] not that he did it you say i'll choose
[1:20:29] you don't choose you no
[1:20:31] but by his foreknowledge he know who
[1:20:34] would and who would not
[1:20:36] jehovah jireh god by foreknowledge knew
[1:20:40] who would be
[1:20:41] saved and he sent jesus amen to catch
[1:20:45] those that he foresaw wanted to be
[1:20:47] saved
[1:20:48] [Applause]
[1:20:50] now let's go back now to what we open
[1:20:52] with tonight in romans
[1:20:54] jacob have i loved and he saw have i
[1:20:57] hated oh i've stumbled people for
[1:20:59] centuries
[1:21:00] since paul said that you notice paul is
[1:21:02] quoting from
[1:21:03] malachi 1. and this is where he gets at
[1:21:07] that
[1:21:08] and you know it would seem quite
[1:21:10] confusing if you really didn't
[1:21:11] didn't have a vindicated message to
[1:21:13] clarify it for you because paul didn't
[1:21:15] really clarify it he just said it and
[1:21:16] let it go with that
[1:21:18] but yeah the prophet said did you ever
[1:21:19] read in romans 9
[1:21:21] how before either boy was born he saw in
[1:21:23] jacob god said i hate one and love the
[1:21:25] other
[1:21:26] how can he be just and do that
[1:21:30] here's the answer by foreknowledge
[1:21:33] he knew what a rascal he saw was
[1:21:37] praise be to god then
[1:21:40] he could predestinate and put something
[1:21:43] down inside of
[1:21:45] jacob that would make jacob do it but if
[1:21:48] god predestinated
[1:21:50] over the top of jacob's will then esau
[1:21:53] could stand there on the day of judgment
[1:21:55] and said you gave him
[1:21:56] something that you didn't give me
[1:22:03] [Music]
[1:22:07] praise the lord are you seeing daylight
[1:22:12] all right some of you praise the lord
[1:22:13] somebody's still in dark well hang on
[1:22:15] maybe we'll get you there before we get
[1:22:16] over
[1:22:17] now he said but for knowledge he knew
[1:22:18] what an hour rascal that he saw was
[1:22:21] so he could predestinate not just say
[1:22:24] now watch this
[1:22:25] not just say the word predestination
[1:22:26] it's not a good word to use
[1:22:28] he said it's for knowledge because he
[1:22:30] wouldn't just deliberately
[1:22:32] turn you away because he wants you to go
[1:22:36] away
[1:22:39] he's not willing that any of you would
[1:22:40] perish
[1:22:44] but all would all would come to
[1:22:45] repentance faith of abraham
[1:22:48] before jacob or esau was either one born
[1:22:52] god could say he saw if i hated him
[1:22:54] jacob have i loved
[1:22:55] because he foreknew what they would be
[1:22:58] now notice this
[1:22:59] he never made esau
[1:23:02] the way he was
[1:23:06] now hold on friends he never made esau
[1:23:10] the way he was
[1:23:11] how come he saw was that way because he
[1:23:13] saw made choices in life
[1:23:15] [Music]
[1:23:18] oh i was predestined to backside i was
[1:23:20] predestinated this and other
[1:23:22] nonsense you chosen life
[1:23:28] god did not make esau that way
[1:23:32] he chose to be that
[1:23:35] praise the lord amen
[1:23:40] i'll tell you what i thank god for this
[1:23:43] amen he never made he saw the way he was
[1:23:46] now listen to this he wasn't willing
[1:23:50] that he saw me that way
[1:23:54] by but esau by choice
[1:23:59] was that way
[1:24:02] choices we make
[1:24:06] now friends let me tell you who makes
[1:24:08] these women to this day strip their
[1:24:09] clothes off and walk around in many
[1:24:11] skirts and real tight clothes and
[1:24:12] bob the house and dress like on the what
[1:24:15] who makes the men of this day put
[1:24:16] earrings in their noses and earrings in
[1:24:18] their ears
[1:24:23] they go around wearing rings ain't on
[1:24:24] their fingers to our rings so now they
[1:24:26] start wearing them on their toes
[1:24:29] my goodness what in the world doesn't
[1:24:31] matter folks
[1:24:32] [Music]
[1:24:36] you mean it was god that makes the young
[1:24:39] people of this day
[1:24:40] the young men and i've seen them in
[1:24:42] airports that if i didn't know no better
[1:24:44] i think i was in a zoo somewhere
[1:24:47] come down this side of their their head
[1:24:49] sticking straight up like they plugged
[1:24:51] the wrong thing into the electric socket
[1:24:53] and this will strike down on this side
[1:24:55] purple up here
[1:24:56] pink here and yellow that
[1:25:00] you mean god made people like that god
[1:25:03] wanted
[1:25:03] every one of them punks or whatever they
[1:25:06] call themselves
[1:25:07] their weirdos god was not willing
[1:25:10] that they'd be like that they chose that
[1:25:13] themselves
[1:25:14] every homosexual every lesbian
[1:25:17] ever adulterer ever liar god
[1:25:21] never made them that way oh they say god
[1:25:25] made us this way that's a lie from the
[1:25:27] devil
[1:25:28] [Music]
[1:25:28] [Applause]
[1:25:30] [Music]
[1:25:31] [Applause]
[1:25:32] they chose it
[1:25:35] [Applause]
[1:25:38] god never made the sodomites perverts
[1:25:43] and then caused an earthquake and caused
[1:25:45] all the pitch and the tar to explode
[1:25:47] around sodom
[1:25:48] and burn them up they chose to be that
[1:25:51] and god sent judgment on them by their
[1:25:54] own choice
[1:25:55] [Applause]
[1:25:57] amen
[1:26:00] god never wanted east ought to be that
[1:26:03] way
[1:26:03] but esau was that way and god looked way
[1:26:07] ahead and said
[1:26:08] i hate esau
[1:26:12] but i love jacob how
[1:26:16] about full knowledge choices we make
[1:26:26] choices we make he saw by choice
[1:26:30] god knew he would go that way now watch
[1:26:33] again god's covenant with abraham god
[1:26:36] being god before the foundation of the
[1:26:38] world know who would be saved and who
[1:26:40] would not
[1:26:41] he could say that he hated esau and
[1:26:44] loved jacob before
[1:26:45] either one of them was born for by
[1:26:48] foreknowledge he knowed what a little
[1:26:50] shaster that he saw would be
[1:26:52] and he knew he would save jacob's soul
[1:26:54] therefore by foreknowledge he knew these
[1:26:56] things would be
[1:26:59] he's not willing but for knowledge let
[1:27:02] him know it
[1:27:03] he could predestinate according to
[1:27:05] foreign knowledge
[1:27:07] now listen to this there is people as
[1:27:09] bad as we want to say it
[1:27:11] that were born to eternal destruction
[1:27:16] not predestination by his will
[1:27:20] but by his for knowledge so you see
[1:27:23] friend when we attribute to god
[1:27:26] god ordained this bunch of tribes out
[1:27:28] here to go to hell
[1:27:30] god hates them when we say that
[1:27:34] and we project that by god's desire
[1:27:37] look we want what we are putting in god
[1:27:40] evil
[1:27:41] hatred that is not in god
[1:27:46] [Music]
[1:27:49] now men use evil men you've got hatred
[1:27:52] all kinds of things by the natural birth
[1:27:54] sometimes if you're converted that's out
[1:27:55] of you
[1:27:56] but god ain't god no such a stuff let me
[1:27:59] go a bit farther and i'll start
[1:28:01] you see not that god wanted to condemn
[1:28:04] esau
[1:28:07] but he knew god knows everything
[1:28:10] not because he wanted to but because his
[1:28:13] foreknowledge let him
[1:28:15] know who would and who would not
[1:28:19] he didn't say i'm going to choose you
[1:28:21] and i'm going to send you to hell
[1:28:23] i'm going to choose you and i'm going to
[1:28:24] send you to hell that was not
[1:28:26] god's idea god said i love jacob and
[1:28:30] eddie saw his foreknowledge let him know
[1:28:32] that esau was
[1:28:33] nothing but a shyster
[1:28:36] let's stand together we'll pick it up
[1:28:40] again
[1:28:43] oh brother donny if we are thoughts of
[1:28:47] god
[1:28:49] did god wait till i made my choice
[1:28:51] before he made his choice
[1:28:54] and if we're thoughts of god we always
[1:28:57] were in the mind of god
[1:28:58] weren't we sure
[1:29:02] those thoughts were right
[1:29:05] amen right
[1:29:08] those thoughts were eternal
[1:29:11] but not the person
[1:29:14] [Music]
[1:29:16] some of you all have got eternal persons
[1:29:18] in heaven
[1:29:20] there is no eternal persons in heaven
[1:29:23] there was an eternal person
[1:29:26] we don't believe in eternal sonship
[1:29:28] around here and jesus
[1:29:30] or us
[1:29:36] there's no such a thing as eternal
[1:29:37] sonship it's the eternal
[1:29:39] elohim now let me close
[1:29:43] church age book page 154 before i close
[1:29:45] on this subject
[1:29:47] i know there is a question in your minds
[1:29:49] you will want to know
[1:29:50] if i believe in the doctrine of
[1:29:52] pre-existence
[1:29:55] i don't believe in that mormon doctrine
[1:29:57] or pre-existence of
[1:29:58] souls any more than i believe in
[1:30:02] reincarnation or the transmigration of
[1:30:04] souls but be careful here and see
[1:30:06] this it is not the person
[1:30:10] that comes predestinated eternally
[1:30:13] from god it is the word
[1:30:17] or seed
[1:30:21] it is not the person these people
[1:30:25] you understand is not these persons here
[1:30:27] that come eternally predestinated from
[1:30:29] god
[1:30:30] but it is the word or the seat how how
[1:30:33] do we
[1:30:34] we as human beings repopulate the earth
[1:30:37] comes from the man right
[1:30:41] the man carries the seed within himself
[1:30:44] well god wanted to populate the earth
[1:30:47] and how would it be by his sea
[1:30:50] not as the man but his seed was his word
[1:30:55] so these thoughts were always in the
[1:30:58] mind of god
[1:30:59] not the eternal person was in the mind
[1:31:02] of god
[1:31:02] but this thought was in the mind of god
[1:31:05] now in order to project these thoughts
[1:31:08] into certain human beings
[1:31:09] and be just because if he deposits a
[1:31:13] thought
[1:31:13] in one certain human being and don't put
[1:31:15] it in another human being at the end of
[1:31:17] the way
[1:31:18] that human being will say you gave them
[1:31:20] a great advantage
[1:31:21] they had a deposit i didn't that's what
[1:31:24] made them love you
[1:31:25] that's what made them serve you i didn't
[1:31:27] have a fighting chance
[1:31:28] i was born a sinner i didn't have no
[1:31:30] representation i didn't have no seed i
[1:31:32] didn't have nothing
[1:31:35] so he's got to project them thoughts in
[1:31:37] the right way
[1:31:38] how is he going to do it by
[1:31:42] foreknowledge
[1:31:44] it does not change your identity with
[1:31:46] him but it only puts you in the right
[1:31:47] way
[1:31:48] as thoughts not as persons praise be to
[1:31:52] god
[1:31:53] it is not the person that comes
[1:31:55] predestinated eternally from god
[1:31:58] it is the word of the seed you see way
[1:32:01] back there too far back for the human
[1:32:04] mind to grasp the eternal god with
[1:32:06] eternal thoughts
[1:32:07] thought and decreed jacob have i loved
[1:32:10] but he saw have i hated neither was born
[1:32:14] neither had done good or evil
[1:32:16] but it was the thought of god
[1:32:20] based how on foreknowledge
[1:32:24] now here's these thoughts in god's mind
[1:32:28] i want children children of my own
[1:32:32] now it wasn't that he said little donny
[1:32:34] little bill little jim little joe little
[1:32:36] fred little carol little marshall little
[1:32:38] so-and-so and so
[1:32:40] no that there was his thoughts in his
[1:32:42] mind
[1:32:43] how am i going to get these thoughts
[1:32:45] expressed
[1:32:46] and justly do it so we look down through
[1:32:50] the stream of time from the very
[1:32:52] beginning to the end
[1:32:54] and saw the billions of souls that would
[1:32:56] live
[1:32:58] and seeing what every one of them would
[1:32:59] do what age they would live what choice
[1:33:01] they would make
[1:33:04] then he could decree and set such a
[1:33:06] thing
[1:33:07] i write their names in my book and when
[1:33:10] they are born i'll place a deposit
[1:33:12] inside of them
[1:33:13] and this way i can do it justly
[1:33:16] because they would have chosen me anyway
[1:33:20] now once they get to life as soon as
[1:33:23] they take that
[1:33:24] ah that breath of life
[1:33:28] i place that deposit down inside of them
[1:33:32] because my foreknowledge declares to me
[1:33:35] they want to live
[1:33:36] for me they'll want to serve me they'll
[1:33:37] want to do right and those others
[1:33:39] there's no need to put nothing there
[1:33:40] because they'll never come to me because
[1:33:41] my foreign tells me they'd never live
[1:33:43] for me
[1:33:45] and then that play gives an eternal
[1:33:47] quality to the elect what what what what
[1:33:50] made you eternal it was not through the
[1:33:52] copilation of mother and father
[1:33:53] it was not through some kind of sexual
[1:33:55] intercourse that your mom and daddy had
[1:33:56] it was not that it was not the natural
[1:33:58] sexual breathing or what gave you
[1:34:00] equality like that
[1:34:01] it had to become from an eternal source
[1:34:03] what was it the mind of god
[1:34:05] the very thought the very seed word of
[1:34:07] god
[1:34:08] that projected down into a body of time
[1:34:11] but remember
[1:34:12] keep him just keep him righteous keep
[1:34:15] him
[1:34:15] clean when it's all said and done and
[1:34:18] you bring
[1:34:19] all your ideas together about
[1:34:20] predestination election for
[1:34:22] nation and all that make sure you've got
[1:34:25] god
[1:34:27] still being right
[1:34:30] because if you have one conjecture of
[1:34:32] any doctrine
[1:34:34] that changes god's nature you're wrong
[1:34:39] choices
[1:34:45] choices we make maybe we'll look at it
[1:34:48] again
[1:34:48] but i want to tell you your reward
[1:34:53] that you receive at that day will be
[1:34:56] based upon choices
[1:34:59] that you have made
[1:34:59] [Music]
[1:35:02] choices you have made
[1:35:06] respect that you give to one another
[1:35:08] phone calls that you make to brothers
[1:35:10] and sisters when they're down
[1:35:11] sick discouraged whatever things that
[1:35:14] you do
[1:35:15] choices you make you see god don't set
[1:35:19] you here in pre-programming sets in a
[1:35:20] pipe
[1:35:21] just pulls you through on the other side
[1:35:22] but god has a way here
[1:35:24] to where you can take his program you
[1:35:26] are now an heir of the father's business
[1:35:29] and said here take what will you do with
[1:35:32] it son
[1:35:33] what will you do now i'm going to give
[1:35:35] you a space here in life
[1:35:38] and i'm going to let you have a lot to
[1:35:40] do
[1:35:41] with your reward on the other side
[1:35:45] what will you do is it
[1:35:49] choices choices
[1:35:53] let's pray together
[1:36:04] choices
[1:36:08] heavenly father
[1:36:11] i pray lord
[1:36:15] you would help us tonight that
[1:36:18] we can realize what a responsibility
[1:36:21] that we have
[1:36:22] as mortals being here in life
[1:36:25] choices that we have to make
[1:36:29] all righteous god
[1:36:34] i pray in the name of jesus
[1:36:37] you would help each of us that we could
[1:36:38] make the right choices
[1:36:43] i must say before these people and be
[1:36:45] quite honest
[1:36:48] i've never seen it so clear
[1:36:51] i knew you had to be just and if they'll
[1:36:53] remember back
[1:36:54] when i first came here several years ago
[1:36:57] one of the first messages i ever
[1:36:58] preached on
[1:36:59] on this was predestination by
[1:37:02] foreknowledge
[1:37:04] but lord i see it even clearer tonight
[1:37:06] than it did then
[1:37:09] father when every one of us stand before
[1:37:11] you at that day
[1:37:14] i now realize that the bride will not
[1:37:16] face the white throne judgment
[1:37:18] but she will set before the reward
[1:37:21] throne to be given out
[1:37:23] but when every mortal walks before you
[1:37:28] no one will be able to say justly i
[1:37:31] never had a chance
[1:37:35] every one of us will stand on the same
[1:37:37] basis
[1:37:38] with the same opportunity with the same
[1:37:42] choice to choose right from wrong heaven
[1:37:44] or hell
[1:37:46] good or evil the sorriest
[1:37:50] man and the sorriest woman or the most
[1:37:52] righteous saints
[1:37:54] will stand there on the same basis as
[1:37:57] far as free moral agency
[1:38:01] by their own choice god
[1:38:04] may we realize tonight
[1:38:07] many of our victories many of our
[1:38:10] deliverances
[1:38:11] many of our blessings are as well by our
[1:38:16] choice
[1:38:17] you've given us laws to work by
[1:38:20] you've told us if we give you'd give to
[1:38:23] us again
[1:38:24] i don't think that's just limited to
[1:38:25] money you told us if we'd praise you and
[1:38:28] worship you you'd bless us back
[1:38:32] some people wonder why they don't never
[1:38:34] get blessed and they look around
[1:38:35] why is someone so blessed so much they
[1:38:37] come to church and they're so blessed
[1:38:40] if they would look at the law of god and
[1:38:41] realize what we put into the service
[1:38:45] the amount we sow is also going to
[1:38:47] determine
[1:38:48] what we reap if we don't put in no
[1:38:51] worship we don't put in no praise we set
[1:38:53] her like a bump on a pickle then when
[1:38:54] the anointing is poured out
[1:38:56] more than likely that's what we're going
[1:38:57] to get god
[1:38:59] help us to realize father that we have
[1:39:01] choices to make
[1:39:03] lord as i said earlier we don't have to
[1:39:05] feel led to worship you
[1:39:07] we don't have to feel led to sing we
[1:39:10] don't have to feel led to clap our hands
[1:39:12] and praise you
[1:39:14] your word done tells us to do that lord
[1:39:18] i don't have to feel led to get up and
[1:39:20] pray tomorrow and say well
[1:39:22] do i feel led to love my wife today or
[1:39:24] not
[1:39:26] lord i'm commanded in the word to love
[1:39:28] her
[1:39:29] i i don't have to pray am i going to
[1:39:32] feel led today to be grouchy
[1:39:34] or am i going to be kind lord the word
[1:39:36] tells me what to do
[1:39:38] help us father to realize lord that the
[1:39:41] devil has been pulling the wool over
[1:39:43] much of our eyes
[1:39:45] lord have been robbing us of many of the
[1:39:47] blessings that belongs to us and it lays
[1:39:49] in the law here that you've given to us
[1:39:51] and we've got to rise as joshua and the
[1:39:53] people of israel and claim our
[1:39:54] inheritance
[1:39:56] not just sit around and wait for it to
[1:39:58] fall out of heaven and fall in their
[1:39:59] laps
[1:40:00] but oh god there are choices that we
[1:40:02] must make
[1:40:04] father i pray you would help each one of
[1:40:06] us lord that we can begin
[1:40:08] by the grace of god to make the right
[1:40:10] choices father
[1:40:11] lord that we wouldn't sit around waiting
[1:40:13] all of our days waiting for you to do
[1:40:15] this and waiting for you to do that wait
[1:40:17] until you're led to do this
[1:40:18] but oh god we can look in the word and
[1:40:20] sure we want to make sure
[1:40:22] it's written in the word that we're
[1:40:23] supposed to do these things but father
[1:40:25] after we find it in the word
[1:40:27] we want to do it with all of our hearts
[1:40:29] lord god
[1:40:30] help us to make the right choices i pray
[1:40:34] lord
[1:40:35] won't you grant it lord jesus
[1:40:38] hallelujah where he
[1:40:43] leads
[1:40:48] me
[1:41:00] i
[1:41:07] lord god
[1:41:30] where
[1:41:41] wants to do that by his grace where
[1:41:51] [Music]
[1:41:55] [Laughter]
[1:41:57] lord god
[1:42:07] [Music]
[1:42:18] the bride will fall
[1:42:30] [Music]
[1:42:40] is
[1:42:43] [Music]
[1:42:46] you know how jesus came to the earth and
[1:42:49] died for your sins
[1:42:51] free moral agency
[1:42:57] father not my will
[1:43:00] but thy will be done watch him
[1:43:04] as he takes communion with the disciples
[1:43:07] in a foreshadow
[1:43:10] he takes it and he bows his head and he
[1:43:12] prays
[1:43:13] and gives thanks first corinthians 11.
[1:43:16] the scripture were used for communion
[1:43:18] he took the bread and he gave thanks now
[1:43:21] look what he's doing
[1:43:23] he was that bread so he's thanking the
[1:43:27] eternal father which has embodied
[1:43:29] himself
[1:43:29] in the son thanking him for the
[1:43:32] fulfillment
[1:43:33] of the atonement then he takes the bread
[1:43:37] and he breaks the bread
[1:43:40] now what was the bread the bread was him
[1:43:42] he told them this bread is my body
[1:43:45] what's he doing displaying free moral
[1:43:48] agency
[1:43:49] he takes the bread and he
[1:43:52] breaks the bread and gives it to
[1:43:56] the disciples it was not judas that
[1:43:59] broke the bread
[1:44:00] it was not the spirit that come down and
[1:44:02] broke the bread it was not someone else
[1:44:04] that broke the bread
[1:44:05] he broke the bread and gave it to
[1:44:10] the disciples hallelujah hallelujah
[1:44:14] he could have had a wife
[1:44:18] right he could physically at the
[1:44:21] physical anatomy of any ordinary man
[1:44:23] he could have physically fathered
[1:44:24] earthly children
[1:44:28] but he said father i sanctify myself for
[1:44:31] their sakes
[1:44:33] he could have been born in a palace or
[1:44:35] any kind of great royalty
[1:44:37] but he chose to be born in a manger
[1:44:42] choices we make

[1:45:04] ordained to god and this is ordained to
[1:45:06] god when a lot of it ain't been ordained
[1:45:07] of god it's been our own choices
[1:45:10] and satan has pulled it over our eyes

[1:47:56] that he foreign he foresaw and knew that

[1:48:02] a deposit down inside of you
[1:48:04] which was his eternal thought which
[1:48:06] given eternal quality to the elect
[1:48:08] and then he could stand there before all
