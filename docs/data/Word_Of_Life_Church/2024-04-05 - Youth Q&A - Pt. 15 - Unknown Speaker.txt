a small crowd as we said this way aren't you so glad that he comes absolutely Every Time We Gather in his name that's his promise um before we start with the question answers several people had asked me about um brother Ron today and uh they was able to do his uh stin not only on the one that was 90% blocked but also the one that was 70% which they thought they wouldn't be able to do so we're grateful for that um last time I heard from Brother Andrew a few hours ago he was still having quite a bit of pain pain you heard anything any update on that still having the pain um so that did an EKG to check and see why that's going on but the think possibly that where his heart was deprived of oxygen that that's probably where that's coming from so we certainly want to remember brother Ron tonight I know we've already prayed but I know it means so much to him tonight if we'd remember him also those that'll be streaming the service you all at home please remember our brother and as I hear things I'll starting to keep you updated let's just pray together Heavenly Father we love you so much we thank you for your presence Lord Jesus we recognize you're here and Lord we thank you that whenever we gather together whether there's a building full or a handful you promised that You' make with us we're so thankful now Lord we've come again tonight that we might be able to bring it down on just a little bit de different level than a regular type service and how I've so enjoyed these questions Natures myself I've so enjoyed studying them and I just pray that it would be a blessing and a benefit Lord dear God we want to bring before you tonight our brother Ron I know all over the world today his name has been called before you and we're just believing tonight Lord Jesus that you're going to continue to be with our brother and just strengthen him and help him Lord we're grateful that they were able to uh do the stin Lord and then two more again today and they wasn't even sure they could do the one but we're so thankful that was able to do that and we're just praying that you'll be with him and strengthen him in his body you know the reason father that he's still dealing with this pain I know that brother Mark had texted me yesterday before church and sent me a picture of him and um he was on on several liters of oxygen oxygen even then so we're just believing you for a a complete healing and deliverance in our brother's life other needs here tonight Lord those that are streaming we pray that You' just be mindful of each one as we approach you tonight through these questions help me Lord Jesus that I can be able to get out of the way that I can surrender myself to you father if there's a need here that lays outside of what I've studied dear God make me sensitive to your spirit it may not be but four or five words that one Hungry Heart would need but it might change their life Lord so please help me that I can follow your spirit Lord help these young people to realize that it's not just important that I get out of the way but them pulling and them with an open heart also has such an impact on the service so each one of us are here tonight father reporting for Duty in the work of God bless us together we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus amen this is a really good question I really really enjoyed uh studying it brother brandham said that if a woman cuts her hair the husband can divorce her where is this in the Bible in today's age I don't think that cutting hair is dishonoring her husband the Bible says to cut is not the same as shaving of the hair now this is one thing that I want all of you all to always remember I want you to be able to be honest and I want you to be able if you have a question in your heart you'll never get a correct answer answer if you Doctor up a question and you just kind of present half of what you really feel about it but if you have a question you know God ain't going to strike and send Thunderbolts and Lightning Out of Heaven just strike you dead on the scene we've all got questions and one of the better ways for those questions to be answered is that we're honest and we just say Lord I just don't understand this I have all kinds of questions sometimes he tells you sometimes he don't sometimes he says trust me about it and what I like to to read as far as the scripture is concerned now about this question it's 1 Corinthians 11:3 but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God I find this so unusual in the way that Paul addresses this so instead of starting at the top of the protocol our instead of starting at the bottom of the protocol and working his way up or starting at the top and working his way down Paul actually starts in the middle of what he's going to deal with because he's going to deal with god with Christ the anointed man and then he's going to deal with the natural man and a woman so he doesn't start with God and he doesn't start with the woman but he actually starts in the middle I notice how he does that but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God so I think why in the world would he start it that way then notice there is a definite order to the way that God does things y'all believe that right God bless you you can be seated a lot of folks feel like that with anything with God you know that God doesn't like order but actually said God is a god of order by that I don't mean that uh God wants us so cut and dried that the spirit of God can never move Among Us that's not order that's dead religion and we don't want that but yet we know that God does have an order and there is a Divine protocol and God himself is the one that instituted that now in order to understand Paul addressing this in the Corinthian Church I'm so grateful for the Corinthian Church now they were they were the most most carnal Church in the entire New Testament that was addressed but yet a lot of our issues down through time had it not been for God capturing that stage of their carnality we wouldn't have any other any other New Testament places to refer to about hair no other place we wouldn't have none we wouldn't even have the order of the gifts we wouldn't have many things that we need and that the church has needed down through time if it had not been for God capturing now with a lot of other churches you don't find God capturing that infancy in their growth look at the Ephesian church I mean it starts right out with great powerful Revelations so if God would have just wrote about the Ephesian church church of Philippi Church of thessalonica all of them a lot of the things of the early growth stage of the church we wouldn't have have any Doctrine we wouldn't know how to even base it but God allowed Theirs to be captured I'm grateful for that aren't you you know it's the same thing with people's lives and people look at brother brandham and they want to compare brother brandom you know to other prophets of the Old Testament and brother brandom as far as capacity and understanding God allowed him to stand in a place that many of the Old Testament prophets never even was allowed to to stand but one thing about brother brandham is that we get to watch a prophet for the first time be able to grow and grow and grow for decades of his walk with God we don't get to see that with Paul we don't get to see that with habac Jeremiah Zephaniah Zachariah many of those prophets that part of their life is absolutely missing the only time we see about them is whenever they stomp out of the Wilderness thus sayith the Lord God said this and that and the other and they'd stomp right back in the wilderness and disappear but we get to see for the first time a prophet and as he's growing in his understanding and he has to even come back and say I had the wrong idea about that I had the wrong idea about this why God's allowing us to see a prophet as he's growing and being able to learn and one thing I love about him is that he can stand up and say I used to believe this but I was wrong as a matter of fact brother BR mentions about the Virgin verse that he used to believe that the egg actually came from Mary then God showed him and said if it would anything come from a human being a human being had some part in the work of Redemption and they didn't but one thing I love about him was he was a big enough man to stand up and say that he believed this years ago but he had to believe this in treport 1965 it talks about security and he said you Baptist Brethren had it wrong and he said I did too but when an angel of God stands and corrects you then you can stand and be corrected so we see the same thing then in the Corinthian Church so for the most part it was a Greek Church they were Gentiles like like we are here tonight and Corinth was a city that it was a Seaport City and they worshiped all kinds of gods but the main Goddess that was worshiped there was aarti there was others that was worshiped but she was the main one and in there some of these converts in Corinth uh they were former uh worshippers of aari former worshippers of some of these other gods and I mentioned it just briefly a couple of weeks ago that they would actually have uh their priest were not men but they were Priestess which were women and they Blended together if you can imagine it in your mind sex related types of things whenever they would come to worship and some of the the Corinthian uh Saints had become so identified with that they were bringing some of these things inside the Corinthian Church now you never find Paul having to deal with the women in their position uh in the in the book in The Book of Philippians and the book of Colossians and the book of Ephesians 1 and 2 Thessalonians he didn't have to deal with it at all because they were not so affected by this worship so in Corinth the women were a lot of a dominating force and the women that become Believers message Believers if you wish to call them that they were bringing some of this same stuff inside the church now a lot of times people read the book of Corinthians and they feel like that Paul was being so hard on the women and Paul had it in for the women but we know better than that he was a true servant of God he didn't but it was such a big issue there was why that he had to deal with it so 1 Corinthians chapter 11 a lot of it is dealing with this whole idea of the definite order of divine headship now that is the Heavenly headship and the Earthly headship as well it's not only just in the church but it's it's also in the home life so Christ is the head of the man and the man is the head of the woman but I want you to notice now you know headship for a lot of the men and the message that I've dealt with over the years and a lot of the men they get this idea about headship headship headship and they run it in the ground and I'm telling you what their wives have to just about have permission to sneeze she about has to have permission to buy ketchup or mustard one that's not a head that's a dictator but what I've noticed many times and many these men that have that warped understanding of headship they themselves are not subject to Christ their head and you see this is the only way that we as men will ever be able to lead our wives and our children in the proper way and it's the only way that a man can ever really be a god-called pastor to be able to lead people in the Rapture because preachers will do sometimes the same thing they will be so so strong and so adamant oh you got to get permission I've told you before there's message pastors their people have to get permission for them to go on vacation they have to get permission for them to trade cars that's not a pastor that's a dictator his name ain't Hitler but it should be because that is not what God called pastors to be you don't need my permission to trade cars you don't need my permission brother Donnie can we go to Hawaii I'll ask you this can you afford it well if you can and that's what you think you want to do go for it you know I've been there I don't want to go back myself but whenever it becomes to where that you get a leader out from under the right headship himself then it will come on down to where that he cannot be able to project headship in the right way so this is what Paul is dealing with and I'm so glad that he did because it would have never been dealt with in the New Testament had he not so the real subject then that we want to look at tonight and that we want to discuss for a little bit is the subjection to Authority so under God's government there is a Divine protocol and there is a chain of authority and a woman is supposed to be subject to her husband who is supposed to be subject to Christ now listen so it doesn't confuse you Paul actually goes on to explain that Christ is under the subjection of God now some would look at that and say say oh my goodness does that mean there's two Gods does that mean there are two beings no it does not Christ means Christos which is the anointed one so what was the anointed one it was the human body of Jesus which prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane father not my will but thy will be done what was Jesus doing he was submitting his life now remember he come to the Earth as a human and he had a soul soul and he had a flesh body and he had a spirit and he must come as a willing sacrifice so he was not a creation that was projected of God that had no feeling on his own Jesus had human desires that's why that the prophet tells us Jesus was tempted by women he was tempted by drinking he was tempted in all points like as we are it must be done this way so the human sacrifice for our soul could be one that was willing not a robot that was pre-programmed I will go to Calvary I will die I will do this no he had to come to a SP a spot in the Garden of Gethsemane to where the choice was laid before him and that's the way God does us he don't want to make any of us serve him he don't want to make any of us pleas him he wants us to do it because we love him so God's Humanity which was Jesus Christ had to come to exact same way so he subjected himself and his Humanity to the father's will so then that's us as men those of you men tonight that are married those of you brothers that will be this is what we are subject to now I could give you all kinds of examples we don't have enough time tonight for me to but when you look at a lot of marriage problems what I've found is and counseling many people around the world in marriage that you'll find a man and if he gets out of the proper headship himself then he will throw the holy economy in his family out of headship then he'll notice the wife start having some credibility issues with him because no wife really can be subject to a man or sell if that man's not a son of God if he's not living the right kind of a life and she can be able to look at him and have respect for him because if she doesn't how can she be subject to no more than me so if y'all heard I've been caught drinking and I was smoking and I was vaping and I was doing all kinds of things and then you all are going to come back and hear me over and over again and you're going to hear me get on you and preach on you I'll tell you what you're going to do you're going to sit there and think how can he tell me to quit vaping when I saw a picture of him in the Johnson City prayers and he was vaping himself could you have any respect for me neither can wives have respect for husbands who don't live a Godly life and whose head is not Christ well praise the Lord now God is a god of divine order and God loves order now I'm talking about divine order not man's order what we are against and what God is against is man's order when man wants to Captivate and capture us and say you've got to do it our way uh I'm against that and God's against that but I'm not against divine order I believe in divine order so but when there is a broken continuity in the order of God there always follows a loss of power now it it's it's opposite the way the world would think because people think the more they give to God the the less control they have and and they don't have control of their Liv and they can't do this and they can't do that and somehow Satan convinces them that they're losing power because they're losing control but in reality the opposite is true the more we give over to him then the more he gains control of our life and the more he endues us with power from on high but the more we control of Our Lives the less control he has and the less divine power he will give us so it's exactly the opposite of the way that Satan will present it to us and when there is a loss of power there's also a loss of victory in a person's life now keep in mind headship is not dictatorship so the headship of the Eternal which was over Jesus the man it was not the Eternal dictating to his human body that we call the son son you're going to the cross I don't care where you want to or not you open your mouth and I will whip you that's not headship even in the garden father if it be thy will let this cup pass from me nevertheless don't you understand those words are part of the Plan of Redemption for you and I if he would have had one little bit of resentment I'm going but I'll tell you right now I don't like this at all this is totally unfair you mean I have to bear the sins of a homosexual I have to bear the sins of lesbians how can you do this to me how can you even ask me to do this for these liars and whoremongers this is this is not fair when people go to talking to me about fair I like to remind us of this Fair then their Affair it really just falls into nothing if he would have had one bit of resentment he could have never been the sacrifice that I needed that's what makes it so miraculous and wonderful that he knew all of this is going to be put upon him but he subjected himself unto the headship of this great Eternal the Eternal you understand could not die so God had to condem sin in a form that could die oh praise the Lord now in in the Corinthian Church this principle was being violated so the Corinthian Church coming out of that IM immorality it must have been a horrible horrible place so one Mark now listen to me now we're going to come to the to the question of the individual now let me read it to you again brother random said If a woman cuts her hair the husband can divorce her where is this in the Bible in today's age I don't think that cutting hair is dishonoring her husband the Bible says to cut is not the same thing as shaving the hair so now let's go back to the setting of where Paul wrote this about the woman having long hair and having power on her head how in the world would you have power on your head so one mark of a temple Priestess which was actually a prostitute one way you always knew the women of Corin when they were adulteresses and when they were harlots was they all cut their hair some of the Corinthian women started bringing short hair into the church now you can understand it had they got converted and they were out there in the world and they come to church and their hair was short they didn't know no different but they were starting to bring it in and still keep it cut so Paul is not trying to jump on the women but what he sees is the world the Corinthian World being brought into the church and they were sitting there and they didn't realize that by having that look they were still identifying as Corinthian prostitutes so actually it is in the Bible so it was a sign of disrespect to their husbands when a woman would cut her hair now watch this in 1 Corinthians chap 11 verse4 so it was a sign of a prostitute and it would be like a woman that would stand out on a street corner dress in a certain way most of you are adults she would dress in a certain way and you would notice by the way she's looking looking and and the city the certain spot of the city that she's at and all that sort of thing you know what kind of woman that she was so here these Daughters of God were coming into church and they led the Lord Jesus and they was worshiping and praying and actually some of them was some of the ones speaking in tongues and prophesying and yet Paul was looking out there on them and said Daughters of God you're looking like St street prostitutes oh my goodness now listen how Paul addresses this in verse four every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonor his head so every man now I want you to think now real carefully Paul is a Jew Now by this time it was already Jewish custom that men would at least wear either a shawl over their heads or the little cap I was in Jerusalem several years ago and before they let you go down to the whaling wall it makes no difference what you believe it makes no difference whether you're black white red yellow whether you're Jew Gentile it don't matter either you put that on the back of your head like that or you are not allowed to go to the Wailing Wall just up to you if you don't want to go fine because they've got guards there and they will put you to going so I wanted to go down to the weding wall I've been several years ago I didn't wail but I didn't want to wail either I didn't want them whooping me so they hand it to you you put it on the back of your head and of you ever seen Jews and they have those little things on the back of their head all right now this is totally opposite of what Paul belied notice what he's saying he's saying something totally opposite to Jewish custom totally opposite to what he's believed his whole life every man praying or prophesy having his head covered dishonor his head now listen same English word used but there's two different headships here so whenever then a man would cover his head and he comes in a prayer most of you boys know this from little bitty guys you never wear a cap into church why why would you want to see anybody stand up here preaching with a ball cap on although someone sent me a a a clip a while while back and it was a message preacher in a meeting preaching ranting and raving and preaching with a ball cap on and there was hundreds and hundreds of so-called message people there and the men had on ball caps and they claimed to be so revelated and so deep I thought and looked looking at it you don't even know First Corinthians much less anything else what a shame now watch this would have been so different from Peter and James and John all them Jews because his little kids they were they were raised with that tiis on them and they would go down they would never do it without that being there but I find it amazing because here now we got what I mentioned last night where could we go back to the Old Testament say all right Paul I'm going to check you out by the Bible I want you to show me now Paul where the Bible says this he couldn't have pulled up no Old Testament scripture I don't care what he done because every one of them would have done it he would have done it prior to his conversion but you see what God got what God did God dropped down a revelation in Paul the prophet's heart that the order of it had actually even changed from the time that Peter James and John and all them imagine so the Gentiles were coming in with their tradition and the Jews s it every time they'd go to synagogue they would WRA their they grab their Tice and bring it over the top of their head and they'd read the Torah Paul said oh no we don't do that anymore we don't do that anymore so every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonor his head so to remove the Hat I found this in history to remove the Hat the turban or the covering on the head is is a mark of respect for a superior when in his presence so then a man that would wear a hat or a turban or a tith or whatever it was whenever he would come in the presence of a superior and notice the law did not preach that I find it amazing because people think you can get away with more under grace than you did under law but when you really realize Grace is a great liberator but it also has some pretty strict things that you can and cannot do so it was a sign now that people were closer you know to me what I see about it is that the law could never bring them quite in that paradia which is the personal presence of Christ but by the shedding of the blood they were so much closer into the presence of God in the New Testament that God said' don't you men pray with that cross on your head because you're in the presence of one who is superior to your all so take your cap off wow isn't that awesome now notice in verse five now watch him contrast the man with the woman but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonor her head every woman that prophesies with her head uncovered so if a woman then will pray or prophesy with her head her natural head uncovered which is not Avail but her hair she dishonors not her own personal head but her husband so when she cuts her hair she dishonors her husband which makes her a dis honorable woman which is why they was put away in divorce so you see when brother brandham said that he was exactly with history and exactly with scripture every woman that prayeth or prophesy with her head uncovered dishonor her head for that is even as all one as if she were shaven so what does this Express then by a woman cutting her hair she's unveiled just by cutting it like the women in Corinth was doing so it is a token of her assuring authority over her husband and casting off that subjection simply by trimming her hair cutting her hair which God himself placed her under that so when the woman does that she's defying God because God was the one that gave her that ability to grow that hair so she dishonors her head now listen to this history here as well both among Jews and Greeks the long Tresses which is curls of a woman were her glory only in times of mourning or when convicted of shameful sin which was adultery you know what they would do to a woman who was called an adultery anybody you know by the law in the Book of Numbers know what they would do they would cut off her fingernails they would cut off her hair everybody that saw that woman knew she was an adulteress now this was also in the Greeks as well but it was the Romans who began to change it so when a woman would mourn and she would mourn a a mother a father a child something like that that then many times they would cut it off but notice in in Jewish law a woman proves she was guilty of adultery when she had her hair cut off write it down Numbers Chapter 5: 11 through 31 so Paul used two different words in 1 Corinthians 11 verse 5 and verse 6 shaved means that all the hair shaved off Shor means cut short either one would be a disgrace for a woman here again the word head it must be taken now when you think head head it has a double significance with a woman it is her natural head and her husband with a man it is his natural head and Christ so it's a type of shame that a woman brings upon her head just like it would be with a man that does not obey his head which is Christ the word so the word Shor if you go back in the original text for the word it is the Greek word which is KIRO ke i r o which means cut with shears remove by cutting verse six again for the woman be not covered let her also be Shor but if it be a shame for a woman to be Shor or shaven let her be covered so the Corinthian women who were cutting their hair were actually bringing themsel on a visible appearance to look like street prostitutes you imagine they were speaking in tongues they were shouting they were glorifying God and many of them were saved they were saved Christians don't you understand where that puts the majority of denominational Christians and they say oh hair don't make no difference it does it does make a difference that's why a man's not supposed to have his long it's a shame for a man to have long hair now notice the women then was bearing in thems the image of a typle prostitute the original word used for shame was the Greek word ason which refers to something that is a disgrace it is the neuter form of as cross which is translated filthy filthy so then for a woman to cut her hair or to have it Shor off just totally Shor off either one of them is a disgrace a shame or fil y so does a man have a right to put his wife away for being a disgraceful woman a filthy woman he does according to the Bible and if a man has that right so does God have that right so you see a woman then that would refuse woman naturally and church woman that would refuse to say I don't care what the Bible says I don't care if the Bible says my long hair is a glory unto me it it gives me a headache I'd rather have a headache than a whole body ache in Flames would you well it you know it's hard and people laugh at me and make fun of me let them laugh one day you'll be laughing and rejoicing down streets of gold and you'll be glad that you are notice this and Debbie evine's expository dictionary of New Testament words across is defined as that which is opposed to modesty or Purity notice now verse seven Paul goes on and says for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and the glory of God but the woman is the glory of the man you see when when a man and woman are joined together in marriage it's not like the man can just do whatever he wants to do and the woman can do whatever she wants to do and they don't affect each other they do so when a woman then cuts her hair she's removing the glory that God ordained I think of it this way that the woman according to what the Bible says a man indeed ought to not cover his head for as much as he is the image and the glory of God think of it brothers that God made us to be his glory so the way we live the way we act and all of that our life can bring glory to God or shame do you see the two main aspects that we're looking at glory and shame glory and shame no wonder Paul use these words shame and Glory so then a woman who cuts off her hair and she has that look about her not realizing that she's taking on the ancient image of a prostitute so this would have been advertisement to men on the street of that day I am an ill famed woman I want to sell you my body I am a prostitute I am defiled and I will bring shame on you then you understand why that God looks at the churches there that disobey him and God says I I can't let you be my wife I can't take you in the Rapture you were a disgrace to me you disgrace my words you disgrace my cause so God says I will put you away in divorcement oh my Lord Jesus I don't want that father but the woman is the glory of the man now it's amazing when you look at it that the woman now you think so it's not the man's muscles it's not the man can stand around I'm a great image of that right Hercules number three you know more the man said wow I've got this masculine profile the the the glory of the man is not how much he can lift the glory of the man is is the glory of the man is a god-given woman and when then that woman has her glory in the proper place she has a crown the woman has a crown and she actually crowns the man do you understand who's going to Crown the Lord Jesus he is not not crowned think of how long he's been waiting he's been raised from the dead for over 2,000 years he's been a high priest for over 2,000 years and he still does not have his crown yet what's he waiting on us because we are his crowning Glory brother Joel you're talking about us weak human beings us frail human beings and Yet the woman according to what Peter said the woman is the weaker vessel but God God chose the weaker vessel to Crown the stronger vessel us men God chose our wives well my goodness if being Carol would go to liftting weights you know ain't no way in the world Carol can compare I I can live way more than she can I'm way stronger than she is in many ways but I don't Crown her she crowns me like come on brother say Amen but you see how God does this order it's not like sister old you know men are the head and the men get to do this and that and the other but when you look at it God allows you to Crown this strength of this man in your life and then when a woman Rebels against that that's why God looks at it in the way that he does now whenever the glory of the man comes to her spot she glorifies not only the man but she in turn glorifies God by oby obeying his word and and the prophet even tells us himself that the woman has more to overcome than what we do and in one sense of the word sisters you'll receive a greater reward think of it when brother Brenham went beyond the curtain of time it was not the preachers that come to him first it was not even the men it was the women the women and the women of Leota thought he was so against them but apparently God let the sisters outrun the men they were so happy to see him he said it look like the quote I read to you last night he said it looked like there was a million of them brothers where in the world were we you know the sisters here they come I mean they just took off run and running they were so happy they were not you know brother R why in the world that you make it so hard on us in life they were taking they were they were embracing him and coming around him and then the brothers came by they were so happy that word had carried them beyond the curtain of time they were not the to pick a fight with brother B I've got a score to S with you you made it so hard on me they were so happy to see him notice Paul says in verse eight for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man neither was the Man created for the woman but the woman for the man but when you look at honor and Glory again the man do not of the woman he did not come out of her but she come out of him but yet she crowns him don't you see Jesus in his church Jesus didn't come out of us we come out of him but we crown him oh Hallelujah neither was the Man created for the woman but the woman for the man for this cause now listen to this sisters for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the Angels power on your head how in the world would you have power on your head look at this word you've heard me use it many many times it's the Greek word exusia which is Authority right jurisdiction the power of authority influence the power of rule or government so a woman has power on her head when she leaves her hair uncut now remember there are sisters and I've been in different parts of Africa sub Sahara Africa and a lot of the sisters there their hair oh my I mean hundreds and hundreds of them it just won't grow long it's it's very curly and it won't grow WR and and I have been asked this question over and over and over again by the African sisters and you don't realize how they look at you on video and how envious they are of your long hair and many of them think I don't have long hair I don't have long hair but when you look at the word long it's not measuring in length so much but it's uncut not trimmed hair oh it's amazing whenever you're able to stand there and say but sisters do you cut your oh no brother no brother no I said then you have biblical long hair because it's uncut hair they feel like shouting oh brother brother thank you thank you thank you they feel like hugging you but we're not in the sixth Dimension yet so that ain't possible but for them to be free because they feel like I don't have long hair would I not be bride Oh Praise the Lord don't you just love God's word now listen Paul says for this cause an au the woman to have power excuse you look at also another meaning of this word it's the power of him whose will and commands must be submitted to by others and obeyed and listen to this last part a sign of a husband's authority over his wife and you know what gets me is every Baptist Theologian every Methodist Theologian if they really are Theologian every Presbyterian every Catholic priest a lot of these Pentecostals if they have the uh just a Greek dictionary is all they need and to look up this word they know this word just like we do so what do they do when they preach it they have to leave this part out especially if their wife Cuts their head so right here is the word that Paul chose to use of a woman having power on her head so it's a sign of a husband's authority over his wife the sign of Regal Authority Crown a sign of Regal Authority or a crown my goodness so Paul was telling them sister not no doubt whenever they received this letter because Paul wasn't actually there to preach this in person he was in prison as a matter of fact but whenever they received this letter and there's probably sister sitting there and the minister would have got up behind the pull pit and said now Saints you know we've got a new letter from the prophet of God and in that day think about it many of the people there did not acknowledge Him as any Prophet so they would have just been standing up and they were reading quotes they were reading quotes out of these books hello they were reading quotes out of these books and the majority of the world thought Paul was an absolute nut and they said what do they do at that church well somebody told me them preachers get up there and they read quotes out of this man well is that man where's he at why somebody told me he's in prison oh Lord that must be a cult ain't it you mean they you mean they don't even stand up there why somebody told me they don't even take their text out of all the Old Testament Scrolls why Paul don't even stand up bur and read the book of Genesis or Exodus or Leviticus or Numbers Deuteronomy oh my Lord I cannot believe what do they preach you ever heard that man named Matthew Matthew oh yeah was he the tax collector Guy Somebody told me he got saved and he turned into an author and wrote some book a tell all book about Jesus or something you mean and that's what they're preaching them bunch of heathens oh my goodness you imagine the scribes and the Pharisees they just blast them into the pits I cannot believe these people have pulled away and joined this cult and they stand up there and read quotes if it had been modern day they' have projected them on the screen wouldn't they don't you see we are being criticized like our brothers and sisters in the first century I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them now notice Paul brings it now what would you and I have ever thought a woman having long hair uncut hair would have ever given her power and a royal a Regal Authority and actually a crown now Paul says that for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head not a veil not a piece of material but her hair power on her head because of the Angels angilos messenger one who has sent a messenger from God now the prophet refers to this and he said said they better have long hair cuz when that messenger comes he'll blast them but you know when you look at long hair and the angels Paul also wanted them to recognize that Angels were in their services and that Angels would have taken note of them women with that cut hair you cannot imagine how repulsive that this would have been to an angel who has never disobeyed one word never disobeyed one word and they are a sign they were here last night they'll be here again Sunday they're all over the Earth with the saints of God so the the Angels come and they will watch the impropriety or the misconduct of people in the church and they look at Adam and they're trying to relate they're trying to understand Grace and they're trying to understand all this that God is doing and yet the angels of God it would bring them such Delight in the subordination of the people that fall in the proper order of the divine order of God so when the angels of God see say a preacher like me and I will I will get an idea and I'll get a thought about this that and the other and I'm thinking oh wow my my boy that sounds so good so I'll go to look in the Bible and I'll go to look in here and then I'll go to look in the message and then I say oh praise the lord it's scriptural it's message it's good I I like to tear down my own sermons first because I get all kinds of critics so I like to look at it make sure if I can tear it down somebody else can do so I want to make sure that it's right so when I present you the truth I want to know what I'm talking about so whenever I stand there and I run it through Paul I run it through the prophet of this age I run it through the Bible and then I'll Stand Up and preach it to you the angels of God are here on the platform they're here in the building and it brings them such pleasure that A Gifted Man did not say I'm so gifted I really don't need to prove this by Paul I'm so gifted I don't really need to run this through the message I think I'll just say what I think is right about this situation but when the Angels see me and the other men of God around the world and they want to see them oh we're subordinates we are AR we not we're subordinates and the angels of God can see and be able to relate that's the way I've always done well I can't say that because I've missed him before haven't we all but the angels of God when they those Holy Angels they can say I've never messed up I've always obeyed him those beings might be milons ions of years old we don't know and yet you and I have to say oh my goodness I've made so many mistakes I couldn't even count them oh no how in the world can I compare to an angel well in that sense you can't but what God has done for us is so great that they peer over and look into it and the angels of God you imagine them being around so the insubordination of women that would cut their hair or men that would not be under their head Christ the Angels must be left in in offense and it would offend them how could you all do that how could you women cut off your crown so when women cut their hair they're removing their glory and they're removing their Crown by which they are to Crown their husband by subjection they're reaching up and pulling it off and throwing it on the floor where their hair lays when The Beautician cuts it off now believe it or not I've seen women come in the barber shop where I go and they get it cut so short that I've actually left with mine a little bit longer than theirs were and you're talking about weird when you go in and sit down in a barber chair and there's a woman s you say oh dear God you imagine how the angels of God must look at such sisters they may laugh at you and make fun of you but remember you're wearing a crown you're wearing a crown for Jesus Christ now watch in verse 13 Paul says judging yourselves is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered does not even nature itself self teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him but if a woman have long hair well brother Donnie how long is long well let's look at the word that Paul used to define long to let the hair grow there's some sisters in our church I've known them for years and years their hairs never got packed just about here some of them right at the top of their shoulders it ain't CA they cut it it just won't grow and there's some that have it down here ericus was way down here some of it touch the ground I've seen them with theirs where they couldn't even it would actually go down and touch the ground and lay a few inches past their heels on their on their feet CU it was so long but yet the sister whose hair is only this long if it's uncut hair it meets God's requirement the African sisters in sub Sahara whose hair is not any longer than mine is yet they meet God's requirement praise the Lord but if a woman have long hair it is a say it with me glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering now you'll see see a branch of the menites some of the Amish some of the Hutterites some of the different ones even used to years ago some of the nazarin some of the Holiness that uh I used to preach for years ago some of them women you'll see them and they'll have the little thing on their head and their preachers ministers whatever they wish to call them teach them that they must have a covering and I agree 100% but it's not a piece of cloth it's their hair if they believe the Bible now notice if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair her hair is given to her for a covering look at this word vesture a covering thrown around a wrapper a mantle a veil here is the mantle I believe in here is the wrapper so you sisters that God has given you and your jeans and your DNA and all that is made to wear as my wife sitting here tonight draped with her hair pretty curls on the bottom draped around what is it it's a rapper look everybody look at her she'll pass out when you do but look at her look at her look at look at her hair dra draped around it is a wrapper she don't need a black cloth or some other kind of cloth to wrapper head God gave her her covering God Gave You sisters your covering it is your glory praise the Lord a covering thrown around a wrapper a mantle a veil praise the Lord Jesus so it is an actual adornment an Adorn an adorning that God would give to the woman and where does it come from from nature so it comes from nature so a woman's long hair was then and is now the woman's glory and given to her as a visible expression of the differentiation between male and female Sexes so you'd be able to look at him and one and let's just all be honest with one another you look at things today things you know I'm not sure what to call them exactly and you're not sure if it's a him or a her or a Shem or a sham or a grim or a Graham or a you you you don't know what they even are you know I mean they're passing laws in States I just read of some this week and if you use the wrong pronoun that person can actually bring you before court in Canada it's already there you can get prison terms that's just right north of us what a terrible time we're living in so can you imagine preachers that are compromisers no longer will be able to read and preach what I preach to you tonight from the Bible and I'm sure you've noticed already I've not been bringing you quotes in these question answers we believe the Bible in our church we believe the message too is that right but I want you when people ask SK at work and this and that you can take them to the Bible cuz they're not going to be interested in quotes from brother brandom I want you to be able to have a scriptural answer that is our foundation we can talk the message among ourselves we can share quotes with one another among ourselves but what good does that do to people out here but we want to be able to have an answer from God's Bible praise the Lord I like it that way myself don't you all right now before I go to this next one anybody else have a question I'm going to step out a little bit here anybody else have a question about this before I leave it well praise the Lord I'm almost done pretty good with it you all right thank you Jesus please explain Psalm 100 verse one a Psalm of Praise Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands now I'm not sure exactly whoever the person is because I think brother Rob might have given me this one I don't remember but there was no name which is not necessary I'm not sure exactly the point of the question but I wanted to uh go to this part about the Joyful Noise so a Psalm of Praise Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord now some of us that's the only thing we can do because we can't sing very good and you know we just do the best we can but I want you to listen to the the meaning of this word noise to shout raise a sound cry out give a blast I mean some people that's what they do in church they just blast don't they to shout a war cry wow to shout a war cry some people do that sometimes in church and it'll scare the liver out of you when they do it you ever been standing near somebody and they give out a w and I mean you just free are about pass out because you know well you know it's amazing because a lot of this fits under the meaning of noise noise you see how we can get so set in our minds and we think it can only be a certain deciel you know if you get over that oh my that's totally out of order not according to the meaning of this word here so a shout a war cry alarm of battle to sound a signal for war or March to shout in triumph over our enemies to shout and Applause to a shout with religious impulse to shout for Joy so a Psalm of Praise Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands serve the Lord with gladness come before his presence with singing Praise the Lord let's stand thank you Lord Jesus we'll ask our noisy musicians to come and our noisy song leader praise the Lord I don't know about you I love spring time because the song birds come back brother random said those song birds were His Radio I love hearing them because I think I know y'all think I'm weird probably sometimes anyway but I think what they learn that and how did they learn how did they learn that to stay on Pitch how how do they you know you just think strange things but I just love to hear them because they just whistle and whistle and sing and sing and so who does that benefit why did the Lord give them that ability for us for us to be able to enjoy it and they're singing with all of their little hearts and they're just praising and praising and praising and then they'll die down during the day I'm sure you noticed it 11 11:30 something like that they'll kind of get quiet and then in the evening when the Sun goes to set it'll pick right back up again and they go to singing and fluttering and flying around and they're getting ready to rest and Roost in the trees at night but they are making a noise to the Lord and every now and then you'll hear one that's off pitch a little bit and I laugh at him because I think well that's old like me you know and he he you know you got these and boy they're just harmonizing and they're doing this but he's making a Joyful Noise was to the Lord oh my don't you just want to do that to Jesus Hallelujah let's just bow our heads heavenly father thank you for this time that we could be together tonight Lord I Thank you for this question I've been so excited about coming and bringing this tonight father because I felt like that it would help maybe different people that are struggling and trying to understand it I pray that it'll be one of those Monumental things that will be shared with people around the world that it'll help people to be able to understand it help our sisters to realize they have not been given a position that is so worthless and they're at the bottom of the pole as we would say that they have been given a glorious position she was taken out of man but yet you in turn you use her to Crown man and you gave her the ability not man the ability to grow hair down past their knees down to the ground and be so long and so beautiful and then you would identify that as her crown and you father would say that she was the glory of the man and you would turn around and say that we as your church are your crown I can't say I fully understand all of that how could me a flawed human being ever be a crown to the Lord Jesus but I believe your word Lord I pray you'd help each Young man each single man each married man help us as the men of the message the young men of the message to desire that our lives can be more subjected to you some of the brothers here tonight are married others aren't yet maybe they're looking for a young lady to be their wife some of them are too young for it yet but eventually they will but may they take these things to Heart tonight and see wow if I really want to to marry a daughter of God then I I need to be the right Son of God help them to realize that they need to have their life subject to you so their wives that want to be subject to them and it's amazing that with each subjection that there is in the Divine protocol of God that you will honor the subjected one with great Glory so the wives are to be subject to their husbands and with that subjection they receive an honor and a glory that the man does not receive the man's hair is not a glory the man's hair is not even called a crown but the wives subject themselves and they bear that and you turn around and bring glory to them then we as your human servants on the Earth we subject Our Lives to your word we give up this we quit this we don't go there we don't say this we do all these dos and don'ts and then what do you do you turn around and say because of that I will make you my crowning Glory because of your subjection and your submission to my word and my call I will not let the Angels Crown me on that that day but I will allow you my wife my bride Hallelujah Lord even in the scriptures pertaining to the resurrection that Paul wrote when he wrote about that second resurrection and he said then shall be brought to pass the saying that death is swallowed up in Victory and yet you yourself did not completely fulfill that verse that verse was left for your bride so you Crown us with such Glory oh Jesus thank you tonight father then we don't want to just wait till we get to heaven to give you glory and praise we want to give it to you now so every principle of God every promise of God that we obey and submit ourselves to and we may struggle with some of them for a while and finally we just accept them and say Here I Am Lord help me we are giving you glory and our submission brings an element of Glory back to our lives then really the way we look at it the more we give up the more Glory we have thank you Jesus who are we that the almighty God would beckon to each of us tonight come and walk with me give up this and that in the other and I promise you for everything you give up I'll give you so much more and return Hallelujah We Worship You Jesus we give you praise tonight father if there's a young man or a young woman here tonight who's not suren rered everything they are maybe what I've talked to them tonight about they believe it because it's the word but they've not yet entered into it they've not yet found that transfer of subjecting to the word brings great power it's not how much we retain that gives us power but the more we give away the more power we give back I don't know how to explain it to them Lord other than just saying sometimes the weaker I get in In the Flesh and the more people I pray for and Lord if I'm really studying hard and I've got a lot of interviews and counseling people around the world and it's just pulling on me and pulling on me and sometimes Carol knows it's a truth I have so much counseling and talking that my throat is so sore I can hardly swallow and yet I'll come back and I'll preach again and I'll reach some of the weakest moments of my life and I feel my strength is getting away and I've noticed it that when I get weaker you get stronger and you'll come and you're showing us Jesus the more we get out of the way the greater you you are if there's anyone here tonight that's that way father they reserves certain things about their life and they've not given them up because the more we give away the more vulnerable we feel but if we could only get it right in our minds the more we give away the more we're endued with power from on high thank you Lord Jesus Oh Holy Spirit spirit of God come in this place tonight may you walk up and down these aisles Lord God I noticed a while ago when I was talking about your angels that I felt that Supernatural presence you was given witness to me Lord that the angels of God was right here in this service tonight oh angels of God may you pass among these young people you've come in this place place tonight to minister to those who are HS of salvation of life and righteousness Hallelujah we worship you Lord Jesus brother Jesse lead us in worship can we just raise our hands out in the presence of the Lord maybe the Lord would just Quicken something to your heart that you need to give up something you've been struggling with oh if you can only come to that place tonight he won't make you now he won't you to do it he'll give you power power you never dream power to overcome power to walk higher in the presence of God praise the Lord bless you brother Jesse to Jesus I surrender surrender all to him I [Music] freely will and love and Trust You Lord in his hallelujah thank you Lord Jes I surrend [Music] I [Music] surrender all all to the my blessed savior I suren yes Lord oh hallelujah mean it now All to Jesus I Surrender hum At His Feet I bow worldy Pleasures all for take me Jesus take me now and I surrender all I surrender all all to the my blessed savior I surrender all amen do you enjoy that tonight let's give the Lord a hand am you can you can look at that in two ways you can look like look at it you know I have to I have to have long hair I have to dress this way I have to do that or you can look at it as I am the glory God has given me that place to be the glory and that's what he's given his bride he's given his bride this is your place to be the glory I I really love that and to me I when you look at the difference of Law and Grace you know a lot of people think you know this law condemns you and Grace they go either so far one way legalism this way or Grace once saved always saved you can do whatever you want but if you apply Grace like God intended it you will love the law you'll love the law because they're they're they're perfectly parallel with each other they go together the law and the grace have been married so it's it's not I I have to it's I get to Grace says I get to wear my hair long Grace says I I get to wear modest clothes that's what I love about there's things that brother Donnie brought out in that that I've never I've never heard um I always told people because the Bible said so I said how come I have to long he Bible said so then you going to try to explain it and they said well says sha I didn't know the definition to sha I thought it was shaved but and I so appreciate him studying the Bible studying the Bible that just you know we we have the message but people would
