[30:29] we welcome you today in the name of the
[30:31] lord jesus what's a
[30:33] great privilege for us to gather
[30:35] together in it in the house of the lord
[30:39] certainly thank god for his mercy to
[30:41] each of our hearts
[30:42] genesis chapter 1 verse 26
[30:47] we've been speaking about reconciliation
[30:50] through kenosis canosis being
[30:55] the emptying out
[30:58] the changing of almighty god from
[31:02] something which could not be understood
[31:05] or comprehended
[31:07] to a form that would be an act of such
[31:11] humiliation
[31:13] yet be able to relate to his people
[31:18] we want to look here at god making the
[31:21] first
[31:22] man this morning and god
[31:26] said let us make man
[31:30] in our image after our likeness
[31:35] now those of you that went to school
[31:37] very far know that us
[31:40] means more than one
[31:43] there's only one god
[31:46] and there's only one image notice let us
[31:50] make man in our not images
[31:55] but image so what is it spirit
[31:58] and word because god ain't two and god
[32:00] ain't three and
[32:02] god ain't four but hero israel the lord
[32:05] our god is
[32:07] one and god said let us
[32:11] spirit and word make man in our
[32:14] plural image singular
[32:18] what kind of god then are we serving
[32:20] what kind of god are we talking about
[32:22] we're talking about a god that reveals
[32:23] himself in three offices the same way
[32:25] that you revealed
[32:28] after our likeness again
[32:31] not plural likenesses so there wasn't an
[32:34] old man there
[32:35] and then a young man called jesus and
[32:38] god said and i'll tell you what let
[32:39] let us make ma'am to look like both of
[32:42] us
[32:42] i'll give him my eyes and and your nose
[32:46] jesus and he can have
[32:47] my ears and he can have your hands jesus
[32:51] god only had one image and that was
[32:54] christ after our likeness let them
[32:59] now here we go to a real plurality let
[33:02] them have dominion over the fish of the
[33:06] sea
[33:06] over the fowl of the air over the cattle
[33:10] and over all the earth and over
[33:12] everything
[33:13] that every creeping thing that creep us
[33:16] upon the earth
[33:17] so god created man in his own
[33:21] image again one image
[33:25] in the image of god created he
[33:29] him male and female
[33:32] created he them wow
[33:36] so god made one man after the image of
[33:39] us
[33:40] and then he made an us after the image
[33:43] and that one
[33:45] god so here was a man that was
[33:48] plural too male and female created he
[33:51] them
[33:52] in what image the image of god
[33:56] verse 27 so god created man in his own
[33:58] image in the image of god created he him
[34:00] male
[34:00] and female created he them
[34:04] and still yet just in one image what was
[34:07] it
[34:08] spirit form and god blessed
[34:11] them and god said unto
[34:14] them be fruitful and multiply and
[34:17] replenish the earth and subdue it and
[34:19] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[34:21] over the fowl of the air over every
[34:22] living thing that move us
[34:24] upon the earth notice this now
[34:28] whenever we come to genesis 2 7
[34:31] and the lord god formed
[34:34] man of the dust of the ground
[34:38] and breathed into his nostrils the
[34:40] breath of life so the man in genesis 1
[34:42] 26 was one man
[34:44] now we go to genesis 2 7 and the lord
[34:47] god
[34:48] formed man out of the dust of the ground
[34:51] well where was that other guy i thought
[34:55] god had already made
[34:56] man in his own image but you see this
[34:59] man is not in the image of god
[35:02] he's made to the dust to the ground and
[35:05] the lord god
[35:06] formed man of the dust of the ground and
[35:09] breathed into his nostrils the breath of
[35:10] life
[35:11] and man became a living yehesh
[35:14] which is soul animated being became
[35:18] a living soul and the lord god planted a
[35:21] garden
[35:21] eastward in eden and there he
[35:25] put the man man never actually came from
[35:28] the dust of the garden of eden
[35:30] but from the dust outside the garden
[35:32] then he was brought
[35:34] into the garden and there he put the man
[35:37] whom he had formed
[35:40] i mean like to be remembered today as we
[35:42] go before the lord
[35:45] heavenly father we love you so much
[35:49] we are so grateful to know that the very
[35:53] same god who
[35:54] brought our earthly father adam on the
[35:58] earth is the same one that's bringing us
[36:01] today
[36:02] back into your great paradise
[36:05] father we pray that you would help us
[36:08] today as we've assembled
[36:10] lord not just as a protractive gathering
[36:12] not because we didn't have
[36:14] some other place we could go we could
[36:16] have we could have went here and there
[36:18] but
[36:19] we chose to come here we ask you lord
[36:22] that you would
[36:23] meet with us as you said in your word
[36:26] that you would
[36:27] we know your way of meeting with us can
[36:31] vary from
[36:32] service to service based upon our needs
[36:35] based upon the things that each of us
[36:38] come today with requests and desires in
[36:40] our hearts so
[36:42] we're laying them before you and we by
[36:44] no means would
[36:45] try to tell you how to do this or that
[36:48] or the other
[36:49] so what we're asking is that you would
[36:51] just have your way
[36:53] and if you will have your way it will be
[36:56] perfect
[36:57] help me lord that i can get out of the
[36:59] way lord god
[37:01] may you be able to use that part of
[37:03] yourself that you placed in me
[37:05] shut my mouth to anything that would be
[37:07] displeasing to you lord
[37:09] open the ears and the hearts of your
[37:11] children speak to us your great words
[37:14] it's in the name of the lord jesus we
[37:16] ask it
[37:17] and the saints said amen god bless you
[37:20] you
[37:21] may be seed
[37:29] in our minds we can only imagine
[37:32] what it must have been whenever father
[37:37] decided to expand his creation
[37:41] he had already created the universe and
[37:46] millions billions of stars
[37:51] the expanse of the universe to this day
[37:54] still
[37:54] going on and science still seeing more
[37:58] and more
[37:59] as they're able to put their instruments
[38:02] out farther and make
[38:03] better instruments but of all the things
[38:07] that he had made
[38:09] none of them was his crowning
[38:11] achievement
[38:12] like man was and yet he chose
[38:16] not to make man first but he chose to
[38:20] make man in this final stage
[38:24] of his creation the angels of god
[38:28] must have stood around him that day as
[38:30] they saw the father's handiwork
[38:34] and they looked to see something
[38:37] breaking from
[38:39] the logos because we know that the
[38:41] creation was actually
[38:43] coming into view by the visible presence
[38:46] of god
[38:47] which was christ the logos it was the
[38:50] pre-existent
[38:51] stage before he became known to us
[38:54] as jesus the man but it was god had
[38:57] already
[38:58] given birth himself to what the prophet
[39:01] called
[39:01] a son and a son was something that came
[39:05] out
[39:05] of the invisible one and we know that
[39:07] the bible tells us that
[39:09] he is the invisible god and he was the
[39:12] firstborn the lord jesus
[39:14] became the firstborn then of every
[39:16] creature
[39:17] so the invisible wanted to become
[39:20] visible
[39:21] the intangible wanted to become tangible
[39:25] that which had no molecular structure
[39:28] no atoms no time no molecules
[39:32] but he wanted to be something that could
[39:35] be
[39:35] touched and felt and
[39:38] spoken to and he wanted to be able to
[39:42] touch back he wanted to be able to look
[39:45] at people
[39:46] and people to look at him but without
[39:50] a change in him that would be totally
[39:53] impossible
[39:54] since jesus says in saint john 4 that
[39:57] god is a spirit and they that
[40:01] worship him must worship him in spirit
[40:04] and in truth right in this building
[40:07] today
[40:08] are many many spirits
[40:11] they are not so much inside these
[40:14] four walls as they are inside
[40:18] of another realm or another dimension
[40:22] there could be thousands times thousands
[40:26] of angels and demons gathering
[40:29] around us in this little small gathering
[40:33] of people and yet it would be unseen
[40:36] to our eyes we might feel
[40:39] from time to time an impulse or an
[40:42] influence
[40:43] on our being a strange peculiar
[40:47] something whether it's righteousness or
[40:49] evil
[40:50] that would come against us and we don't
[40:52] see it and we
[40:53] cannot touch it but yet it's it's an
[40:56] influence and we know that
[40:57] that's the way demons work and that's
[40:59] the way angels work
[41:01] but yet all around us basically what we
[41:05] know
[41:05] is light matter time science
[41:09] we believe by faith there is a place
[41:12] that the unbeliever goes when they die
[41:14] and that the believer goes when they die
[41:16] but yet
[41:17] we've never been there so we really
[41:19] don't know what it's like
[41:21] people have died they say and went there
[41:23] and came back
[41:24] and told us various things that they saw
[41:27] so it is a realm that remains a mystery
[41:31] to us
[41:31] for sure but the lord wanted to
[41:35] expand himself into this realm
[41:39] that he was bringing everything else
[41:42] if you were the eternal you could
[41:44] actually become
[41:46] no greater than what you were you
[41:49] couldn't become any wider
[41:51] any taller any more vast in your
[41:54] understanding
[41:55] or your wisdom but the only way to
[41:58] really
[41:59] make yourself known greater would be in
[42:02] the
[42:02] act of condensation which is very hard
[42:05] for us
[42:06] because we think greater is bigger
[42:10] smarter more educated so we
[42:14] expand our boundaries and many times
[42:16] that means
[42:17] walking on others to do it it doesn't
[42:19] matter who we hurt
[42:21] or none of that just as long as we get
[42:23] bigger and we get greater and
[42:25] so on and so on but that's not the way
[42:27] that
[42:28] he wanted to be so in order to become
[42:31] greater an expression i could never
[42:34] become greater than
[42:35] what he already was but reach greatness
[42:38] by expression through smallness
[42:42] now listen this is more than the human
[42:44] mind
[42:45] can comprehend and process because
[42:48] as i said we think greater is us being
[42:50] bigger and
[42:51] we want to make our business bigger and
[42:53] greater and expand and go on
[42:55] and on make more money which revolves
[42:58] involves making you know taking more
[43:00] time away from
[43:01] uh many times important things in our
[43:03] life but
[43:04] bigger that's the way bigger and greater
[43:06] and expanding is but that's not the way
[43:09] god thought about it in order for the
[43:12] eternal to become
[43:14] in greater expression of himself
[43:17] he had to do it through the act
[43:20] of condescension so he must by the act
[43:24] of creation create something that would
[43:27] allow him
[43:28] to come into a lower form
[43:31] you see already we don't like that to
[43:34] become
[43:35] lower to become greater that makes no
[43:37] existence it makes no sense to us
[43:39] but we have never existed in the realm
[43:42] of eternity
[43:44] when the eternal was everything there
[43:46] was so you could not go beyond it
[43:48] you could not be greater there's no
[43:50] expanse
[43:52] greater than he himself but he wanted to
[43:55] do this
[43:55] through the act of condescension so he
[43:58] began the kenosis
[43:59] actually before there was ever a world
[44:02] that was ever visible
[44:04] and that was out of the being of the
[44:06] eternal
[44:08] come let's say like this was like a
[44:11] little white light
[44:13] and that little white light began to
[44:15] play
[44:16] as it were around the father's door
[44:19] and it was something that was of the
[44:22] eternal
[44:24] yet an act of condescension by creation
[44:27] that he
[44:27] expanded something jesus said that he
[44:30] came forth
[44:31] and proceeded from god so he was not a
[44:35] little boy there in heaven
[44:36] he was not another man there in heaven
[44:38] and god was you know thousands of years
[44:40] old
[44:41] jesus was about 30 something years old
[44:43] no jesus was not
[44:45] a boy in heaven he was the logos
[44:49] but remember that god had all of these
[44:52] attributes
[44:53] in his being and he wanted to express
[44:56] them but the way he chose to express him
[45:00] was not
[45:01] by the act of creation around you see
[45:03] how do you went straight
[45:04] to the book of the lamb's book of life
[45:08] i'm gonna have only brought into
[45:09] existence those attributes which was in
[45:12] the lamb's book
[45:13] then many many millions of people that
[45:17] will be there through the grace
[45:19] version of the way he chose would have
[45:21] never been there
[45:23] had he only chose the lamb's book of
[45:25] life
[45:26] so god before the foundation of the
[45:29] world made
[45:30] two books one would be the lamb's book
[45:33] and the other one would be the book of
[45:36] life
[45:37] so god's mercy is so great that it's
[45:40] goes beyond the jews right and he
[45:43] believes the jews are the chosen people
[45:45] they were that's right
[45:46] but and yet the grace of god even goes
[45:49] beyond
[45:50] his bride and it goes to a
[45:53] group that will show up in the book of
[45:56] revelation that
[45:57] these are they which came out of great
[46:00] tribulation
[46:01] and they have washed the robes and made
[46:03] them white
[46:04] in the blood of the lamb these are they
[46:07] that have the ability
[46:09] as a mortal to choose eternal life now
[46:14] they don't have it here in this life
[46:16] but they have the ability to choose and
[46:19] their name
[46:19] is not blotted out of the book of life
[46:23] so the grace of god went to the lamb's
[46:26] book
[46:26] but it also spilled over if i consent
[46:29] that way
[46:30] over into the book of life now in the
[46:33] book of life
[46:34] your chances of your name being removed
[46:38] and remaining are entirely up to you
[46:41] you see those whose names are in the
[46:43] lamb's book of life
[46:45] are placed there before the foundation
[46:47] of the world
[46:48] they are written indelibly by the blood
[46:51] of the lord jesus
[46:53] they were called by the eternal before
[46:56] the world
[46:57] ever began they cannot be removed a bit
[47:00] more than his name which was the first
[47:03] and the top of the book but there are
[47:06] those
[47:06] in the book of life which can be removed
[47:09] and if people turn down god's word and
[47:11] refuse
[47:12] what god sends to them then it will be
[47:14] removed
[47:15] but those who choose to have their name
[47:18] remaining in the book
[47:20] they accept the lord jesus as their
[47:22] savior and they walk in whatever portion
[47:24] of light that god gives to them
[47:26] then they're able to maintain that now
[47:29] whenever we go back then to this
[47:31] man that was formed in genesis 1 26
[47:35] i want you to notice how that moses when
[47:37] he frames this
[47:39] and he wants to bring god into the
[47:41] compound revelation
[47:43] of god's character when it comes to
[47:46] genesis 2.
[47:48] in genesis 1 the bible says in the
[47:50] beginning
[47:51] god created the heavens and the earth
[47:55] and the earth was without form and void
[47:58] and darkness covered the face of the
[48:00] deep and the spirit
[48:02] of god now those words are in the hebrew
[48:05] rock
[48:06] elohim ruach elohim
[48:10] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[48:13] face of the waters
[48:14] and you know the rest of the story but
[48:16] notice when we come to chapter 2
[48:19] that moses does not choose the name
[48:22] ruach elohim but he chooses the name
[48:27] lord god now this is the first time that
[48:29] the compound
[48:31] redemptive name of god is chosen to be
[48:34] revealed
[48:35] and it's revealed in the act of creation
[48:38] when it comes to his children so
[48:41] moses did not say god formed man
[48:45] he did not say the spirit of god rurak
[48:49] elohim now the words are are like an
[48:52] eagle
[48:53] so the spirit was coming upon this great
[48:56] thing that he made
[48:58] and he took his wings this is the hebrew
[49:00] meaning of that word
[49:02] that he took his wings and he began to
[49:04] flutter
[49:05] over the earth so ruach elohim began to
[49:09] flutter over the earth
[49:11] and bring creation into view but
[49:14] whenever he went to make
[49:16] this man he did not choose the
[49:19] attribute of rurak elohim
[49:22] but he chose adonai elohim
[49:26] or jehovah lord god so it is the
[49:30] compound redemptive name of god
[49:34] that is revealed when god is expressing
[49:37] what
[49:37] his attribute of sonship
[49:41] notice this in genesis 2 7 and the lord
[49:44] god
[49:45] formed the lord god formed now this is a
[49:48] different word
[49:50] than the genesis the word in genesis 1
[49:52] 26
[49:53] when the scripture said that he created
[49:56] him that was my spoken word but this
[50:00] is formed it is a word that would be
[50:03] used
[50:04] as a potter that would take the
[50:07] elements of clay and he would start
[50:11] forming and putting together in a shape
[50:14] or a mole now in this sense it was more
[50:16] of a
[50:17] free-handed work it was not that he had
[50:20] a mole there and a shape
[50:22] and he poured the pliable clay inside of
[50:25] that
[50:26] but he took as it were his hands
[50:29] and his fingers and he started molding
[50:32] and
[50:33] forming as you and i did whenever we
[50:36] were
[50:36] children and we would take play-doh or
[50:38] clay or red mud or whatever it was
[50:41] that you used to play with and you would
[50:44] take that and you'd start making and
[50:46] shaping and molding
[50:48] so here the lord god began to
[50:51] form this man and i want you to notice
[50:54] how moses
[50:55] writes this and the lord god formed man
[50:58] of
[50:58] the dust of the ground so he actually
[51:02] does not
[51:03] take a manic or a shovel or something
[51:06] like that
[51:06] and go beyond the dust and then down
[51:09] into the top soil and then down
[51:12] into the layers of the stratus of the
[51:15] clay
[51:16] but he actually scoops up right off the
[51:18] top
[51:19] of the earth and he begins to gather
[51:22] together
[51:23] the dust and he
[51:26] makes man a forms man of the dust
[51:30] of the ground now what's this word i'm
[51:32] not sure if you're familiar with it or
[51:34] not
[51:34] but the word man actually in hebrew
[51:38] is adam or the english word is
[51:42] adam so the word man
[51:45] means adam now watch what he does
[51:49] so it is mankind you can see the hebrew
[51:52] word there
[51:52] mankind adam or the first man
[51:56] so the lord god formed adam
[51:59] or the first man out of the dust
[52:02] of the ground now look at this word
[52:05] adomah so here is
[52:08] the man and the word adam actually means
[52:11] red
[52:12] so the man was actually taken
[52:15] from the dust of the ground his name
[52:19] originates with the very place where he
[52:22] come from
[52:24] so where was this other man of genesis 1
[52:27] 26 that the bible said and god made them
[52:31] male and female where was this man
[52:34] at when this man was being formed
[52:38] now he was there in a spirit realm right
[52:41] god had already made him now the man in
[52:44] genesis 1 26
[52:46] is not a future unveiling that god
[52:50] is actually going to wait till the man
[52:52] of genesis 2 7 is made
[52:54] and then further enveloped that word but
[52:56] this man was already
[52:58] there in existence before the man of
[53:01] genesis 2
[53:02] 7. now if you look at that carefully
[53:04] you'll find yourself
[53:06] so watch then god actually forms
[53:09] adam from the dust of adam on
[53:14] and breathed into his nostrils the
[53:17] breath of life
[53:18] and man became a living soul
[53:22] so then the spirit man is now breathed
[53:25] into mammal
[53:29] for adam this adam was a mammal
[53:32] a warm blooded animal the height
[53:36] of animal life now in that so god
[53:40] merged a spirit image into a natural
[53:45] body just like we have today and god
[53:48] makes this man and he gives him dominion
[53:51] over the fish of the sea
[53:52] follow the air over everything that he
[53:55] had and god also
[53:57] of course makes known to the man the
[54:00] lamb's book of life
[54:02] now god in the beginning had adam and
[54:05] eve stayed
[54:06] in their place and at this place of
[54:07] course she was still
[54:09] in him her identity had not yet been
[54:12] separated but god knew that
[54:16] what the woman would do once she
[54:18] separated her from adam
[54:19] as long as she was in adam she could
[54:22] never fall
[54:23] but to further express his attributes
[54:25] the fall was necessary
[54:27] but he couldn't make them fall and then
[54:30] save them
[54:30] and raise them up and be just so he
[54:33] could put them on a basis
[54:35] of what we identify as pre-moral agency
[54:38] adam did not choose to become a son of
[54:42] god
[54:43] he was made that
[54:44] [Applause]
[54:44] [Music]
[54:46] but he chose whether to continue to walk
[54:48] with god
[54:50] or not he did not choose
[54:53] well do i want to be a son of the devil
[54:55] or do i want to be a son of god
[54:57] that was not the choice that adam made
[55:00] it was to be in fellowship with god
[55:03] or listen to the lie of the enemy now i
[55:06] wonder what
[55:07] happens then whenever people are born
[55:10] again
[55:11] now when we come from here let us skip
[55:14] over
[55:14] and we'll pick up in john chapter 3
[55:18] and we find a educated
[55:22] well-scholared well-versed hebrew
[55:26] which my new the law no doubt
[55:30] and with great anticipation had waited
[55:33] for years
[55:34] and years for the kingdom of god to come
[55:37] to the earth
[55:38] as a man which had a background
[55:43] under the great teachers of the day no
[55:46] daddy had an opinion and a view
[55:48] of what the messiah would be so he hears
[55:51] of this
[55:52] guy from nazareth and he follows him a
[55:54] little bit
[55:55] and he starts seeing the things that are
[55:57] transpiring
[55:58] and this man decides to make a visit to
[56:02] the lord jesus his name is nicodemus
[56:07] he comes to the lord and jesus goes to
[56:10] setting force the mysteries of the
[56:13] kingdom of heaven
[56:15] he didn't come right out and tell him
[56:18] where it would be
[56:19] like reading a newspaper but he veiled
[56:23] it
[56:23] in scriptural terms so he speaks these
[56:27] words to this man you must be born again
[56:32] other man looks at him and said born
[56:35] again
[56:36] how can a man when he's old enter the
[56:39] second time into his mother's womb and
[56:41] be
[56:42] born again and jesus still does not
[56:46] come real plain with it but he says
[56:50] the wind blows where it will
[56:54] and you don't know where it comes or
[56:57] where it goes
[56:58] so is everyone that's born of the spirit
[57:00] you might just said
[57:01] thanks that really helped me that was
[57:04] really informative
[57:06] wow
[57:11] jesus never did actually break down the
[57:15] mystery
[57:16] of the new birth to this man
[57:20] did he show me
[57:23] well when you come on over and paul
[57:26] the apostle is able to catch
[57:30] by revelation and simplify
[57:34] much more of what god was wanting to
[57:37] achieve
[57:38] by the new birth you know that god
[57:43] had after this man in genesis 1 was
[57:47] breathed into the visible image in
[57:50] genesis 2
[57:52] and further on of course in chapter 3
[57:55] the man falls so there's a man in
[57:57] genesis 1.
[57:58] there's a man in genesis 2 and there's a
[58:01] prophetic man in genesis 3.
[58:05] now that man in genesis 3 was prophesied
[58:08] by god himself whenever he spoke
[58:12] that there would be a serpent bruiser
[58:15] that would come
[58:16] and bruise the serpent's head and he
[58:18] called him a hymn
[58:20] not a woman but a him so the man
[58:24] of genesis 3 is going to merge the man
[58:29] of genesis 1 back into the man
[58:32] of genesis 2 because whenever the man
[58:36] fell in genesis 3 then that
[58:39] spirit image which was breathed into him
[58:43] the man of genesis 1
[58:45] left him now there again it's hard for
[58:47] us to comprehend because we was not
[58:49] there
[58:50] but adam actually sinned and fell he had
[58:52] the same color hair
[58:54] same color eyes he didn't gain no weight
[58:56] he didn't lose no weight
[58:58] all of that he looked exactly the same
[59:00] but something
[59:01] left him and what was it it was that
[59:04] spirit
[59:04] image of genesis 1 which could not fall
[59:09] now there was something that god
[59:11] breathed into him
[59:12] now you've heard me say it many times
[59:14] before and other men of well as well of
[59:16] course
[59:16] but i'm not sure exactly what adam did
[59:19] have
[59:19] in the garden of eden but whatever he
[59:22] had he lost
[59:24] whatever he had he fell from
[59:27] and what you and i have got if we've got
[59:29] the holy ghost you can't never fall from
[59:31] it
[59:32] so whatever we've got brother jack
[59:34] actually takes us
[59:35] further back than adam had in that sense
[59:40] in the garden of eden and the church
[59:42] said
[59:43] now if you were sealed by the holy
[59:44] spirit according to ephesians
[59:46] 4 30 grieve not the holy spirit of god
[59:48] whereby you're sealed to the day
[59:50] of your redemption so according to peter
[59:53] if you do these things ye shall never
[59:56] fall so there is this token of security
[1:00:00] that puts the real believers so far back
[1:00:03] into christ that they can never
[1:00:07] never fall from that state in the
[1:00:09] presence of god
[1:00:11] so apparently the man of genesis 3
[1:00:14] which was the lord jesus as we know him
[1:00:17] now the fulfillment of the serpent
[1:00:19] bruiser emmanuel and all of that
[1:00:21] has actually been able to through the
[1:00:24] power of negotiation
[1:00:26] and reconciliation he's been able to
[1:00:29] negotiate with whom
[1:00:31] himself and bring his own blood
[1:00:35] and pay the price now remember isaiah
[1:00:37] prophesied about him
[1:00:40] and said that he would bruise him it
[1:00:42] would please the spirit god
[1:00:44] to bruise him and he would make his
[1:00:48] soul an offering now what a peculiar
[1:00:51] thing a
[1:00:51] soul for an offering i thought the blood
[1:00:55] was the offering i thought that it was
[1:00:57] an animal life not in the new covenant
[1:01:00] it is not the blood of an animal that
[1:01:02] we're saved by it is not by do's and
[1:01:04] don'ts
[1:01:05] it is the soul of an innocent one that
[1:01:08] saved us
[1:01:10] why is god focusing on the soul now what
[1:01:13] is the soul
[1:01:14] well the soul is the nature of your
[1:01:17] spirit
[1:01:18] so there was something then about adam's
[1:01:21] soul
[1:01:21] that departed out of his body now we
[1:01:24] know according to the blasphemous names
[1:01:26] 1962
[1:01:27] prophet said whenever he breathed into
[1:01:29] adam's nostrils he became
[1:01:31] an eternal person with god
[1:01:34] so god actually breathed into this
[1:01:37] animal body called adam he breathed
[1:01:40] into him on a deposit of a great
[1:01:43] reflection of the eternal
[1:01:46] how in the world did adam ever die then
[1:01:48] at the age of 930 years old
[1:01:52] unless there was something that left out
[1:01:54] of him
[1:01:55] when he fell from his place all of us
[1:01:57] know of people
[1:01:59] that used to serve the lord and used to
[1:02:01] go to church and used to be
[1:02:02] you know christians as we'd call them
[1:02:04] yet many of them today
[1:02:05] don't want anything to do with the lord
[1:02:07] they want nothing to do with church
[1:02:09] well at one time it seemed like they had
[1:02:11] something with god do we know people
[1:02:13] like that
[1:02:14] they had something with god they seemed
[1:02:15] to love to go to church what happened to
[1:02:17] them
[1:02:18] well they fell from whatever it was that
[1:02:20] they had
[1:02:22] but apparently whatever they had would
[1:02:24] not keep them
[1:02:25] well praise god that's why i'll tell you
[1:02:28] one thing it takes more than saying god
[1:02:30] sent a prophet to keep you
[1:02:32] it takes more than saying well i believe
[1:02:34] in the cross you can believe that and be
[1:02:35] lost
[1:02:36] well i believe god still loved the world
[1:02:38] that's well and good but if you don't
[1:02:40] know
[1:02:40] him not to know his word not to quote
[1:02:43] the prophet well the prophet said this
[1:02:45] that's good we do that and we believe
[1:02:47] that
[1:02:47] it's not knowing brother branham that
[1:02:49] gets you to heaven it's knowing the lord
[1:02:51] jesus
[1:02:52] it's not coming to this church it's not
[1:02:54] coming to some other church
[1:02:55] it's meeting him and the dead has been
[1:02:59] settled and he's actually taken your
[1:03:01] fallen nature upon him
[1:03:04] and he exchanged his nature for yours
[1:03:08] glory to god he actually took your
[1:03:11] fallen nature
[1:03:12] and gave you part of his nature which
[1:03:16] was the nature of god
[1:03:20] oh my help us lord now notice that when
[1:03:22] this man fell
[1:03:24] it put all of mankind of course in the
[1:03:26] old testament that god
[1:03:28] would accept a substitutionary life and
[1:03:30] he would
[1:03:31] accept the lamb which was the first one
[1:03:32] that we know that god himself slayed the
[1:03:35] lamb through the skins and behind the
[1:03:36] bushes to his son
[1:03:37] and daughter and they come out veiled in
[1:03:40] that but yet that could never
[1:03:42] take away where the sin actually laid
[1:03:44] because now they moved from a
[1:03:45] dispensation of innocence
[1:03:47] into a dispensation of conscience and
[1:03:49] now even though they would do wrong and
[1:03:51] ask god to forgive them
[1:03:52] yet the conscience was still there to
[1:03:54] remind them you did this and you did
[1:03:56] this
[1:03:56] and you did this and through the all the
[1:03:59] old testament
[1:04:00] under the levitical order and no matter
[1:04:02] how much they loved god look at david
[1:04:04] what a display of a man
[1:04:05] that had an ungermatized seed of god's
[1:04:08] election inside of him
[1:04:09] to love god the way that man loved him
[1:04:12] it's definitely a deposit of election
[1:04:14] but he could never be born again he
[1:04:17] could feel the spirit of god
[1:04:18] oh he would get anointed and play his
[1:04:21] harp and write beautiful songs and
[1:04:23] psalms and so on and we still love them
[1:04:25] today do we not
[1:04:27] and he was really anointed but the
[1:04:29] anointing would come on the outside of
[1:04:31] him
[1:04:31] and the anointing would inspire him but
[1:04:34] the anointing never went inside of
[1:04:37] his nature and destroyed that nature
[1:04:40] and make david a new creature so he
[1:04:43] could love god he could sing he could
[1:04:45] shout
[1:04:46] he could prophesy things that would come
[1:04:48] to pass and yet steal another man's life
[1:04:50] and cause that man to be killed
[1:04:53] why because his love for god could never
[1:04:56] be quickened
[1:04:57] by eternal life he had a seed and it
[1:05:00] laid there
[1:05:01] but the old testament could never bring
[1:05:03] it to life
[1:05:04] there was no lamb in the old testament
[1:05:07] that had a soul
[1:05:08] all glory there was no lamb because a
[1:05:12] spirit but no
[1:05:12] animals have spirits but they do not
[1:05:15] have a soul
[1:05:16] but there was no lamb there was no
[1:05:18] turtle dove pigeon ox whatever it was
[1:05:20] in the old testament that ever had a
[1:05:22] soul that could stand
[1:05:24] in substitutionary value for the soul of
[1:05:27] man so man's nature then inside of him
[1:05:31] and the law was constant don't do that
[1:05:33] and don't do that and don't do that
[1:05:35] and they wanted not to do it many of
[1:05:37] them didn't want to do it
[1:05:39] but there was no power in them to help
[1:05:41] them not to do it
[1:05:43] and then god would let judgment fall
[1:05:45] upon them and god would punish them
[1:05:47] and then that oh god we're so sorry
[1:05:49] please forgive us lord
[1:05:50] we're so sorry please forgive us and it
[1:05:52] wasn't no time that's right back at it
[1:05:54] again
[1:05:54] why because there was this problem was
[1:05:58] a soul problem it was a
[1:06:01] soul problem in reality every bit of our
[1:06:04] problems when it comes to this
[1:06:06] is a love problem from the soul
[1:06:10] a love problem from the soul this is why
[1:06:13] folks that just accept christ as their
[1:06:15] savior
[1:06:15] put their name on a church book they'll
[1:06:17] never be able to really be a
[1:06:19] real real sold out christian because the
[1:06:22] love of the nature of the world is still
[1:06:24] there
[1:06:25] they've accepted him as their savior but
[1:06:28] not as their lord
[1:06:31] now what's this in question answered so
[1:06:33] what then does the new births
[1:06:35] what is it actually for what good does
[1:06:37] it do
[1:06:38] well the way that many have watered it
[1:06:40] down on the day that we're living in
[1:06:41] that it basically saves you
[1:06:42] and yet god leaves you in this sinful
[1:06:45] state that you really can't keep from
[1:06:47] sinning and nobody can live a perfect
[1:06:49] life and
[1:06:50] and everybody you know everybody's so
[1:06:52] flawed and we are we know that
[1:06:54] but yet if the new birth does not do
[1:06:56] something inside of our soul
[1:06:58] different from the old testament lamb we
[1:07:00] might as well all just get a goat
[1:07:02] or a turtle love or a pigeon and just
[1:07:04] offer that
[1:07:05] because if the blood of the lord jesus
[1:07:07] does not do something from within
[1:07:09] then he's no more than another goat or a
[1:07:12] turtle dove or an ox
[1:07:14] of the old testament then why would god
[1:07:16] offer the soul
[1:07:18] of the lamb of god unless the soul
[1:07:21] of the lamb of god is going to come back
[1:07:24] and deposit part of his
[1:07:26] own nature inside of his own children
[1:07:31] hallelujah oh my notice this in question
[1:07:34] answers if god made man
[1:07:36] in his own image what kind of man did he
[1:07:39] make
[1:07:40] then a question a spirit man in genesis
[1:07:43] 2 there was no man
[1:07:44] to till the soil so here this man of
[1:07:46] genesis 1 26
[1:07:48] is already in creation and yet there's
[1:07:50] no man to till the soil well why wasn't
[1:07:53] there
[1:07:53] because a spirit does not plow a garden
[1:07:56] a spirit man does not go out turn pick
[1:07:59] fruits and
[1:07:59] and trim this and do this no he does not
[1:08:02] do that
[1:08:03] so there was no man to be able to till
[1:08:06] the soil so notice what he says there
[1:08:08] was no man to till the soil and god
[1:08:10] made man out of the dust of the earth
[1:08:13] not in his
[1:08:14] image but in the image of animal
[1:08:17] life now this is what we know so well
[1:08:20] today
[1:08:21] don't you love hate yourself look be
[1:08:25] honest friends we've got this love hate
[1:08:26] relationship with ourselves
[1:08:28] we do and yet we know that it's you know
[1:08:31] it's that thing that's inside of us to
[1:08:32] protect ourselves to feed ourselves
[1:08:34] and so on there's something wrong with
[1:08:35] us if we do not do it but yet it's not
[1:08:38] the real
[1:08:38] us so here this man now comes into view
[1:08:41] and he said
[1:08:42] he was made not in the image of god this
[1:08:45] is not
[1:08:45] in the image of god but in the image of
[1:08:48] animal life
[1:08:49] and he put the spirit of man in this
[1:08:53] animal man so the man of genesis 1 26
[1:08:57] is now breathed or spoke into
[1:09:00] the man of genesis 2 7.
[1:09:04] so this item now what was his name
[1:09:08] before he was adam what was he he got
[1:09:11] this name
[1:09:12] adam actually took on the dust image
[1:09:16] now your name being jeremy your name
[1:09:18] being jack and yours been keith's and
[1:09:20] you know all you different names but
[1:09:22] what is that that's the name
[1:09:24] that was given to your dust body by your
[1:09:27] dust body parents
[1:09:30] but more than likely that won't be your
[1:09:32] real name in heaven
[1:09:34] right you'll have a word name amen
[1:09:37] now we call this man adam because that's
[1:09:41] all we know him by
[1:09:42] but that doesn't mean that's really his
[1:09:45] name
[1:09:46] in the book of life his name might be
[1:09:48] something totally completely different
[1:09:50] remember the lord jesus according to the
[1:09:52] book of revelation
[1:09:53] will receive a new name is that right
[1:09:56] and i will write on them my new
[1:09:59] name so his new name is not the name now
[1:10:03] what is his name now
[1:10:05] jesus christ which is what the name of
[1:10:08] the dust body
[1:10:09] well glory to god donnie reagan jim
[1:10:12] brown
[1:10:13] fred smith whatever it is that's the
[1:10:15] name of your dust body but yet there is
[1:10:18] another name
[1:10:19] by which you will be called at that day
[1:10:22] notice he said he put the spirit of man
[1:10:25] inside this
[1:10:26] animal man here and he became
[1:10:29] a living soul so when this spiritual
[1:10:32] part
[1:10:33] went inside of this natural part then it
[1:10:36] makes the man
[1:10:37] different so the man stands there with
[1:10:39] his toes the prophet liking the question
[1:10:41] answers
[1:10:42] and he said he still there like a a tree
[1:10:44] and his toes is like
[1:10:45] roots in the ground and he's standing
[1:10:47] there but he's not moving he's not
[1:10:49] breathing
[1:10:50] there's nothing going on he's just a an
[1:10:52] animal a corpses would say
[1:10:54] standing there and then god comes and
[1:10:57] breathes not
[1:10:58] just any spirit not just any
[1:11:01] attribute but the attribute which he had
[1:11:04] made
[1:11:05] for this body
[1:11:08] i hope you understand that when you took
[1:11:10] the breath of life
[1:11:13] the same almighty god breathed the seed
[1:11:15] of life inside of you
[1:11:17] [Applause]
[1:11:18] it was not your mama seed or your
[1:11:20] daddy's seed or somebody else's seed
[1:11:23] it was you it was to be
[1:11:26] you before the foundation of the world
[1:11:29] now you put the spirit of man in this
[1:11:32] animal man here and he become a living
[1:11:35] soul now that's the difference between a
[1:11:37] man
[1:11:38] and the animal the animal don't build
[1:11:40] automobiles
[1:11:41] he doesn't do things like that to help
[1:11:43] his living and so forth like that
[1:11:45] he's an animal dumb brute he hasn't got
[1:11:49] a soul now you look at the birds today
[1:11:52] and the way
[1:11:53] you know now we're going into the fall
[1:11:54] and they won't be making it but it won't
[1:11:55] be too long spring will roll back around
[1:11:57] again
[1:11:58] and you'll see the robins and the
[1:11:59] cardinals and the different ones and
[1:12:01] they'll start making their nests and you
[1:12:03] know what they're making their nests
[1:12:04] exactly the same way
[1:12:06] that they did when adam was in the
[1:12:08] garden of eden doesn't it amazing that
[1:12:10] you don't find any robin standing in
[1:12:12] line at home depot or lowe's
[1:12:13] and they're checking out some little
[1:12:14] mini tuba fours and little mini guns and
[1:12:17] you know they got little mini shingles
[1:12:18] and and little mini hammers and they're
[1:12:20] in there and they're just you know
[1:12:21] getting all their white why y'all doing
[1:12:23] there birds
[1:12:23] we're fixing to building this well i
[1:12:25] thought you you no no no no we were
[1:12:27] updated
[1:12:28] we're that day we built little shingles
[1:12:30] and we got little flushing toilets in
[1:12:31] our house and little
[1:12:32] little tiny faucets and stuff and
[1:12:34] everything we've got hair dryers and
[1:12:36] no they do exactly the same way they did
[1:12:39] years ago
[1:12:40] look at the cattle this winter in the
[1:12:42] wintertime and the horses and they'll
[1:12:43] they'll stand right out and you're
[1:12:45] freezing to death you've got on
[1:12:47] all my all kinds of warm clothes and
[1:12:49] them cattle stand right there and say
[1:12:51] how in the world do they do it
[1:12:52] they wear the same coat that their
[1:12:54] grandparents and grandparents and
[1:12:56] grandparents did
[1:12:57] after the fall from the garden of eden
[1:13:00] and you build them a barn and they ain't
[1:13:02] got enough sense to get in and sometimes
[1:13:04] they'll walk in and walk out is that
[1:13:06] right why they don't have a soul so you
[1:13:09] never
[1:13:09] see them out building a barn putting a
[1:13:11] heat pump in the barn and doing all that
[1:13:13] they don't have a soul but look at man
[1:13:15] he keeps progressing more
[1:13:17] and more and more man through
[1:13:19] electronics through science through
[1:13:21] space
[1:13:21] through all that he's doing it'll be
[1:13:23] unbelievable when you think about it
[1:13:25] if time will tear another 20 years what
[1:13:27] man will be able to do but you see by
[1:13:29] doing this
[1:13:30] man then comes to the spot to where he
[1:13:33] becomes the god
[1:13:34] of his own existence because he can look
[1:13:37] around he can see the dog the cat the
[1:13:38] cow the horse the giraffe whatever more
[1:13:40] and they don't do any more than what
[1:13:42] they've done for thousands of years
[1:13:44] but man keeps getting higher and higher
[1:13:47] and higher
[1:13:48] and higher so he becomes to the spot to
[1:13:50] where he does not need god
[1:13:52] anymore in his life if he needs new
[1:13:55] medicine
[1:13:56] he makes it if he needs bigger hospitals
[1:13:58] and more machines to do greater scans
[1:14:01] he just keeps on through scientific
[1:14:03] research and he finds it and he provides
[1:14:05] everything he thinks that he needs but
[1:14:07] he can't minister to his own
[1:14:09] soul
[1:14:11] [Applause]
[1:14:13] so then what was god's purpose when the
[1:14:16] lord jesus
[1:14:17] introduced this strange doctrine that
[1:14:20] would be
[1:14:20] later known to us and down through 2000
[1:14:23] years of church ages
[1:14:24] called the new birth or being born again
[1:14:27] what was
[1:14:28] the plan and purpose of god in order to
[1:14:31] bring
[1:14:32] the new birth so what is the new birth
[1:14:34] well it's something that happens
[1:14:36] supernaturally we know it's not natural
[1:14:38] it cannot be although the natural
[1:14:40] elements
[1:14:41] are instruments by which god will use
[1:14:44] and we hear the gospel we send you a
[1:14:46] preacher preach
[1:14:47] and something moves on a heart or maybe
[1:14:49] you pass a church sign and something
[1:14:51] strikes your heart with conviction
[1:14:53] and you see that and all of a sudden you
[1:14:54] feel like you need to ask god to forgive
[1:14:56] you
[1:14:57] you need and god uses that human
[1:14:59] instrumentality
[1:15:00] but yet the work if it's true is a work
[1:15:03] from
[1:15:03] within so it's something that
[1:15:05] supernaturally comes from heaven
[1:15:07] projected down to create an atmosphere
[1:15:09] around you and then it pulls you
[1:15:11] inside that atmosphere notice this and
[1:15:14] now notice all things 1952
[1:15:16] when the worshiper is purged it's when
[1:15:18] he is
[1:15:19] born again when his old nature dies
[1:15:22] and a new nature sets in so then when we
[1:15:26] are born
[1:15:27] we receive this old nature it's a sinful
[1:15:30] nature
[1:15:31] it was our first husband that had the
[1:15:33] rule over us and every one of us got it
[1:15:35] whenever we were born
[1:15:36] that's why our children as we dedicated
[1:15:38] those beautiful little babies a while
[1:15:40] ago
[1:15:41] but yet if time will tear in the lord
[1:15:43] will will hold off his coming for a few
[1:15:45] years
[1:15:45] they will have to give their heart to
[1:15:47] the lord jesus is that right
[1:15:49] a person could be raised in the church
[1:15:51] dedicated to god
[1:15:52] raised in the church never do any things
[1:15:54] that many worldly children would do
[1:15:56] they've still got to be born again why
[1:15:58] they got an
[1:15:59] ill mean nature which is of the world
[1:16:05] now watch this then he becomes a part of
[1:16:07] god so when the
[1:16:08] old nature dies and a new nature sets in
[1:16:12] well how does it set
[1:16:14] how does it get there what causes it
[1:16:16] when is the moment
[1:16:17] of this transformation then he becomes a
[1:16:20] part of god
[1:16:21] a son of god he gets new life
[1:16:24] and the life is the greek word there zoe
[1:16:27] which means the life of god
[1:16:28] and you become an offspring of god
[1:16:32] so you see what god wants to do in the
[1:16:34] new birth is exactly the same thing to
[1:16:37] you
[1:16:37] that he did in a similar fashion to adam
[1:16:40] in the garden of eden
[1:16:41] thousands of years ago and that was
[1:16:44] breathe your spiritual
[1:16:46] identity into this animal life
[1:16:49] body this is why that we cannot do it on
[1:16:52] our own
[1:16:53] well i'm going to church i'm going to
[1:16:54] get saved today i'm going to how can you
[1:16:56] do it
[1:16:57] did any of you decide that you wanted to
[1:17:00] become immortal on the earth
[1:17:02] was it any of your all's choice that
[1:17:04] here you were you were
[1:17:05] a little germ in your father's body and
[1:17:08] a part of you there inside of your
[1:17:10] father which was in your grandfather
[1:17:12] which was in his father and did you
[1:17:14] decide as a little germ
[1:17:16] i i want to get out of here i don't like
[1:17:18] being here in the lords of my great
[1:17:20] great great great great great
[1:17:21] grandfather
[1:17:22] but i want to be a man i want to live on
[1:17:24] the earth as a man or i want to be a
[1:17:26] woman why of course not
[1:17:27] you had no choice whatsoever but down
[1:17:30] through the stream of time you came
[1:17:33] and by the sovereignty of god it could
[1:17:35] have been another
[1:17:36] come out of there another you know
[1:17:38] mixture of the chromosome from the
[1:17:39] mother chromosome from the man
[1:17:41] if it had been another one it would have
[1:17:42] been a girl it would have been another
[1:17:43] one but you know what god
[1:17:45] chose you to be more a matter of fact
[1:17:47] the prophet said the natural birth is a
[1:17:49] greater mystery to him than the
[1:17:50] than the virgin verse was so but there
[1:17:52] was something who determined that you
[1:17:54] come
[1:17:55] well i made up my mind you didn't have a
[1:17:58] mind
[1:17:58] well i you was no i you was
[1:18:01] a gene in the loins of your father
[1:18:05] so who was it that decided that it was
[1:18:08] time for a son
[1:18:10] or a daughter or another child to be
[1:18:11] added to the family
[1:18:13] mother and father talking about it you
[1:18:15] mean you were actually brought to this
[1:18:17] earth
[1:18:18] without a choice oh my goodness now
[1:18:22] y'all gonna get in trouble if you agree
[1:18:23] to this
[1:18:25] you mean you actually were born into
[1:18:28] this world
[1:18:29] without a choice
[1:18:31] [Music]
[1:18:32] how many of you chose to be born into
[1:18:34] the earth how many of you chose to be a
[1:18:36] human instead of a dog
[1:18:38] none of you wow so you mean you were
[1:18:41] actually born a human
[1:18:42] by a will which was superior to your own
[1:18:47] you're sitting there looking at me
[1:18:48] nodding your head with your little masks
[1:18:50] on
[1:18:50] and you're then they're nodding your
[1:18:52] head that you did not choose to be here
[1:18:54] that you did not choose the day you
[1:18:56] would be here did any of you choose your
[1:18:59] family
[1:19:01] would be nice sometimes if we could have
[1:19:05] [Music]
[1:19:06] you can choose your friends but you
[1:19:08] can't always choose your family can you
[1:19:10] so that we we did not choose the family
[1:19:14] we were born in the time we were born in
[1:19:16] we didn't even get to choose if we was a
[1:19:19] man or a woman
[1:19:20] whatever we were but that choice was
[1:19:22] made by
[1:19:23] someone else now you don't mean to tell
[1:19:27] me you think it was
[1:19:28] just of your mother and father
[1:19:32] to bring a human into this age when
[1:19:34] there's so much sin and so much
[1:19:36] wickedness
[1:19:37] and it's just of them to put you here as
[1:19:39] a mortal
[1:19:42] you're hung you might as well say amen
[1:19:45] what if they could do that and he said
[1:19:47] well
[1:19:48] it wasn't that it was unjust it was love
[1:19:50] oh
[1:19:51] i see so your father loved your mother
[1:19:56] and they decided after however long
[1:19:57] they'd been married they wanted to have
[1:19:59] a child
[1:20:00] and you are the product of that love
[1:20:04] then you come to this earth as a
[1:20:07] productivity
[1:20:08] of a man loving a woman a woman loving a
[1:20:10] man and then you're brought to the earth
[1:20:12] without your own choice without your own
[1:20:15] consideration
[1:20:16] and you think that's just
[1:20:21] could not thou almighty from back in
[1:20:23] eternity
[1:20:25] through his seeds as it were
[1:20:31] down through time and said there will be
[1:20:34] a moses there'll be an aaron there'll be
[1:20:36] a levi there'll be a david there'll be a
[1:20:39] samuel there'll be a donny there'll be a
[1:20:40] nathan there'll be a carol
[1:20:42] there'll be this and that and the other
[1:20:44] if your mother and father
[1:20:46] if your mother and father could be able
[1:20:48] to do what about your
[1:20:50] father that loved you before your mother
[1:20:52] was ever born
[1:20:54] now what is this thing then of the new
[1:20:57] birth
[1:20:57] why is it so oh my was it so imperative
[1:21:01] why is it
[1:21:02] absolute absolute necessity to get it
[1:21:05] then if it is can't you see it will be
[1:21:07] one of the main things
[1:21:09] that satan will try his best to confuse
[1:21:11] people on
[1:21:12] if he can confuse them that they have
[1:21:15] the new births when they really don't
[1:21:17] or if he can try to convince them they
[1:21:20] don't when they really do
[1:21:22] it will be one of the most terrific
[1:21:24] things that he confused people on
[1:21:26] and their entire journey as a mortal
[1:21:29] because
[1:21:30] if they think they've got it and they
[1:21:32] really don't have it they will not go
[1:21:34] away in the rapture
[1:21:35] if they don't think they have when they
[1:21:37] really do
[1:21:38] they'll never be able to accept fully
[1:21:40] who they are
[1:21:42] because they're always looking at their
[1:21:43] human mistakes and their human errors
[1:21:45] and say oh
[1:21:46] if i could only be born again or if i
[1:21:48] only had the holy ghost
[1:21:50] and yet it's setting inside of your soul
[1:21:52] it is you oh hallelujah it loves you
[1:21:55] it's sealed you
[1:21:57] it is him that gives you the strength
[1:21:59] you need from day to day
[1:22:00] and you're wishing you had it
[1:22:10] so the greek word is zoe which means the
[1:22:13] life of god
[1:22:15] and you become an offspring
[1:22:18] of god
[1:22:22] and god can't hurt you
[1:22:26] without hurting himself
[1:22:34] praise me to god this the cruelty of sin
[1:22:38] so the soul of man
[1:22:40] is the nature of the spirit
[1:22:44] now when you're reborn you don't get a
[1:22:47] new spirit
[1:22:48] you get a new nature of that spirit it's
[1:22:51] the same spirit but a new nature of it
[1:22:54] you take two men stand them together
[1:22:56] both look alike one of them a sinner
[1:22:58] one of them are christian one man say i
[1:23:01] got the spirit same as you have
[1:23:03] see but one of them is different his
[1:23:05] soul
[1:23:07] his nature's different
[1:23:10] he's been changed
[1:23:14] oh so you mean brother donnie that he
[1:23:16] quit drinking he quit smoking
[1:23:18] no that's not what i'm talking about at
[1:23:19] all
[1:23:21] a person could drink they could drink so
[1:23:24] much every day they could
[1:23:25] they could smoke they could take all
[1:23:27] kinds of pills they could have
[1:23:29] 57 girlfriends they could cuss they
[1:23:32] could live the office
[1:23:33] terrible life ever was and if they would
[1:23:36] make up their mind and they had the
[1:23:37] ability to quit
[1:23:39] all of those above mentioned things they
[1:23:41] are still as lost as they were before
[1:23:44] because we do not find ourselves
[1:23:48] he finds us we do not change
[1:23:51] ourselves we do not transform ourselves
[1:23:55] amen we kick into action once the
[1:24:00] transformation has started
[1:24:02] in the cycle of our soul that's when we
[1:24:05] start doing things that's when we start
[1:24:07] sanctifying ourselves
[1:24:09] that's whenever something starts moving
[1:24:11] in us and our works become the
[1:24:13] expression of his face
[1:24:15] which has been born in us but there
[1:24:18] ain't but one person
[1:24:20] that can cause the new birth and that's
[1:24:22] the almighty
[1:24:27] there ain't but one man in the earth
[1:24:30] one man in the earth that could have
[1:24:34] caused me
[1:24:35] as a mortal to come to this earth
[1:24:38] because i was in the loins of don
[1:24:42] reagan
[1:24:45] him and my mama marion 18
[1:24:48] 19 years old me being born and lived
[1:24:51] with a little shack
[1:24:54] right up next to windy y'all know where
[1:24:57] windy is and i tell my chicago
[1:25:01] it's not windy city but it's windy
[1:25:03] there's one little store and the road
[1:25:05] comes up like this and turns around that
[1:25:07] little store and then you got a fork
[1:25:08] that goes this way and a fork that goes
[1:25:10] that way
[1:25:10] and if you fork left right there and
[1:25:12] drive out that gravel road about a half
[1:25:14] a mile
[1:25:15] that's where i was brought back i was
[1:25:18] born
[1:25:19] our little old lean to house sat right
[1:25:21] down that gravel road
[1:25:24] cars had come by mama said the dust
[1:25:26] would come to in the house
[1:25:29] now there's purdue people that lived
[1:25:31] around there there was chaplains
[1:25:33] there was all kinds of other people but
[1:25:36] i could not
[1:25:37] glory i could not be taken back to their
[1:25:41] house
[1:25:42] now they had nicer houses in my mom and
[1:25:44] daddy
[1:25:45] the folks down this way the bertrams had
[1:25:47] a nice brick house
[1:25:49] the purdues lived up this way and had a
[1:25:51] nice big two-story
[1:25:53] country style house but i could not have
[1:25:56] been taken to their house
[1:25:58] and called to bertram because i was a
[1:26:01] reagan
[1:26:03] now as poor as i was as underprivileged
[1:26:06] as i was
[1:26:07] i'd still rather lived with my mom and
[1:26:09] daddy
[1:26:10] because if i would have went into the
[1:26:12] bertram house that always been something
[1:26:15] inside of me you know it is folks that
[1:26:17] are adopted
[1:26:18] and they're adopted into a family even
[1:26:19] when they're young and there's something
[1:26:21] inside them
[1:26:22] they want to try to make the connection
[1:26:24] with their biological parents
[1:26:27] lord of god hallelujah don't you
[1:26:30] understand when you were born into this
[1:26:32] world
[1:26:33] you were taken to the bertram house of
[1:26:35] sin or the produce how a
[1:26:37] house of sin but there was something
[1:26:40] down inside of you
[1:26:42] that long to know who your biological
[1:26:45] father was
[1:26:46] there was something inside of you that
[1:26:49] wanted to know
[1:26:50] there's got to be more to go into just
[1:26:52] going to church
[1:26:53] there's got to be more to god than just
[1:26:55] signing your name on a book what was it
[1:26:57] it was that little seed of god inside of
[1:27:00] you
[1:27:01] crying for identity
[1:27:04] [Applause]
[1:27:13] what's this god's provided way
[1:27:17] conversion is the holy spirit that moves
[1:27:23] the old nature out
[1:27:26] and the new nature comes in
[1:27:30] which is the holy ghost
[1:27:39] so you see whenever you look at what so
[1:27:42] many folks believe the new birth is
[1:27:44] today
[1:27:47] i accept jesus as the son of god i
[1:27:50] accept him as my savior you're born
[1:27:51] again
[1:27:53] and where did you get that out in the
[1:27:54] bible
[1:27:56] did peter and them on acts chapter 2
[1:27:59] when they went up to the upper room do
[1:28:00] they sit there
[1:28:01] we believe jesus christ the son of god
[1:28:02] we accept him as our savior
[1:28:04] their birth come from heaven
[1:28:06] [Applause]
[1:28:07] right the pillar of fire divided himself
[1:28:10] in the upper room and their births
[1:28:12] come from heaven well guess what if you
[1:28:14] ever get it yours will come from the
[1:28:15] same place
[1:28:17] during the preacher in the world oh
[1:28:18] so-and-so is my favorite preacher i
[1:28:20] don't care who it is how favorite he is
[1:28:21] he cannot be able to
[1:28:22] give you a new birth no one can do that
[1:28:25] but god
[1:28:28] notice this so conversion is the holy
[1:28:31] spirit that moves the old nature out
[1:28:33] and the new nature comes in which is the
[1:28:36] holy ghost again the lamb and the dove
[1:28:38] if you want to be a christian just ask
[1:28:40] christ and he will take
[1:28:42] your own nature out and put a new nature
[1:28:45] in
[1:28:45] notice he's not saying smoking he's not
[1:28:47] saying drinking
[1:28:48] he's not saying running around or your
[1:28:50] wife or your husband
[1:28:51] you see you get rid of the sin problem
[1:28:54] and the attributes of sin fall
[1:28:56] off they just automatically die then you
[1:28:59] don't have to impersonate anything
[1:29:01] it's just your normal life that you're
[1:29:05] living a friend for those that are
[1:29:07] really born again
[1:29:08] it's no harder for them to live a
[1:29:10] born-again life and it is a center to
[1:29:12] live their life
[1:29:13] as a matter of fact to me it's much
[1:29:15] easier to live a holy ghost field life
[1:29:17] than it is to live a sinner
[1:29:19] you look out here at the centers and
[1:29:20] what they're doing and their master
[1:29:22] don't love them
[1:29:23] you'll never prove to me that the devil
[1:29:24] has love he hates
[1:29:27] that's right he don't love his people
[1:29:29] he's not going to take them to heaven
[1:29:31] he cannot give them a new body he cannot
[1:29:34] give them peace
[1:29:35] he cannot give them joy to me it'd be
[1:29:37] much harder to live for him out there in
[1:29:39] the world
[1:29:40] than it is to live this kind of a life
[1:29:42] oh brother donny don't you struggle
[1:29:44] don't you struggle to be a christian no
[1:29:46] i never have struggled since i was a 12

[1:32:43] let me have a few more minutes kenna
[1:32:46] until this body has been redeemed
[1:32:49] it's subject to sickness again exactly
[1:32:51] right now it's got to die it's got to
[1:32:53] perish
[1:32:54] so did the soul
[1:33:00] have to perish the thoughts
[1:33:04] the soul is the nature of the spirit and
[1:33:06] those thoughts and so forth
[1:33:08] in you had to perish
[1:33:12] before the new man
[1:33:15] could be born into you to make you a new
[1:33:20] creature
[1:33:24] god ain't wanting to take your old
[1:33:25] nature
[1:33:27] and remodel it
[1:33:29] [Music]
[1:33:33] he's wanting to kill it
[1:33:41] hebrews chapter 6 part 2 your
[1:33:45] old nature
[1:33:50] oh brother donny that scares me when you
[1:33:52] read them quotes oh my
[1:33:54] scarecrows are for crows
[1:33:59] but i know so and so on so and so and so
[1:34:01] i don't care what so-and-so does
[1:34:03] scarecrows shouldn't scare
[1:34:05] eagles don't you know why satan uses
[1:34:09] scarecrows to keep you and i away from
[1:34:11] the truth that lays in the word
[1:34:12] [Applause]
[1:34:14] your old nature died
[1:34:18] the nature of the world and you become
[1:34:22] a new creation
[1:34:26] and your desires of that whole life that
[1:34:28] had a beginning
[1:34:30] when god breathed the breath of life
[1:34:33] into your nostrils
[1:34:36] when you took that breath of life as a
[1:34:38] baby
[1:34:39] god breathed into you that natural life
[1:34:43] he was born and your name was put on the
[1:34:46] book of life
[1:34:49] and your record was quiet for years
[1:34:52] until you told your first lie
[1:34:55] maybe you and your little brother was
[1:34:57] playing with something you shouldn't
[1:34:58] have been playing with
[1:35:01] and you knocked it off and mama comes
[1:35:02] screaming and crying mom it wasn't him
[1:35:05] it wasn't me he was healed i promise i
[1:35:07] swear to god
[1:35:08] yeah right and something in you then
[1:35:14] made you feel horrible as a little child
[1:35:17] you know what i'm saying
[1:35:20] notice this oh my the life
[1:35:24] that life of your carnal nature died
[1:35:28] it had a beginning
[1:35:32] and it had an end don't you see
[1:35:35] why folks are trying to preach the new
[1:35:38] birth
[1:35:39] that god takes that nature that you was
[1:35:42] born with
[1:35:43] and saves it and fills it with the holy
[1:35:47] ghost
[1:35:47] and transforms it
[1:35:51] god does one thing with it kill it
[1:35:58] and god takes that deposit of himself
[1:36:02] and quickens it with his own soul
[1:36:08] glory to god that's the part of you
[1:36:13] that can be said you've never done it
[1:36:16] in the first place
[1:36:23] notice since that life of carnal nature
[1:36:25] died it had a beginning and it had an
[1:36:27] end and it died and was done away with
[1:36:30] forever
[1:36:33] that old nature god
[1:36:36] came in with the new nature
[1:36:41] did you see why satan would want to
[1:36:44] interrupt this program of god
[1:36:47] he'd much rather offer people a church
[1:36:50] membership
[1:36:51] what don't don't don't take that new
[1:36:52] birth stuff don't get that life of jesus
[1:36:54] that'll make you a little immature god
[1:36:57] that'll make you deity in a human body
[1:36:59] don't get that just cheer your hair just
[1:37:02] take some tapes and
[1:37:04] stay home and play tapes and go to
[1:37:06] church every now and then
[1:37:07] and you know just be a pretty good guy
[1:37:09] you'll go to hell
[1:37:10] you'll be lost
[1:37:15] but this is what happens god came in
[1:37:18] with the new nature
[1:37:19] then love joy peace
[1:37:22] long suffering generous peace
[1:37:26] boy we must need to hear that twice
[1:37:27] didn't we patience and meekness
[1:37:30] and kindness that entered
[1:37:34] and taken the place of malice
[1:37:38] and temper and hatred and
[1:37:41] emulation oh you mean you can't have
[1:37:44] both of them
[1:37:49] it took its place
[1:37:53] when you passed from death
[1:37:57] unto life
[1:38:02] let me read this a little close there's
[1:38:04] people here perhaps in our audience
[1:38:06] that's never accepted this
[1:38:08] formula but as far as receiving the holy
[1:38:12] spirit and being
[1:38:13] inoculated a nature in there that takes
[1:38:18] the old nature out and puts the new
[1:38:22] nature
[1:38:22] in they've never did that i pray thee
[1:38:26] father that tonight that they will
[1:38:30] receive it wow
[1:38:34] so only father can cause this to happen
[1:38:39] if you come up to pentecost to route the
[1:38:41] way myself and some of these others did
[1:38:44] and you went up to the altar and they
[1:38:46] beat you on the back
[1:38:49] jesus you got it
[1:38:53] i'll tell you what i got and it bit my
[1:38:54] tongue off
[1:38:56] because you're slamming the bottom of my
[1:38:57] jaws you got it you got it
[1:39:02] but many of them spoke in tongues and
[1:39:03] didn't have it many of them joined the
[1:39:05] church and didn't have it
[1:39:07] we've seen in our own ranks many that
[1:39:08] come around us that didn't have it why
[1:39:11] people can't give it to you they can't
[1:39:13] beat it in you
[1:39:14] they can't stomp it in you they can't do
[1:39:16] a little
[1:39:17] they can't do that there's only one
[1:39:19] person that can father
[1:39:21] god's children and that is god
[1:39:24] there's only one person that can breathe
[1:39:26] eternal life
[1:39:27] into us and that is the eternal himself
[1:39:31] [Applause]
[1:39:37] let's stand together
[1:39:40] i got way too much to look at
[1:39:45] can i read you one more
[1:39:49] notice what happens to you then thy sage
[1:39:50] will possess the gate of his enemies
[1:39:52] they become a new creature they're a new
[1:39:55] nature they're
[1:39:56] they're a new being
[1:39:59] a new creature there the greek word says
[1:40:02] new creation
[1:40:03] he's quoting now from second corinthians
[1:40:04] 5 17 if you'd like to read it
[1:40:06] a new creation you have been recreated
[1:40:11] again from what you were to the image of
[1:40:15] a son of god
[1:40:16] and a daughter of god it's just
[1:40:20] such and all
[1:40:24] it's the greatest miracle
[1:40:27] that ever happened when a sinner can be
[1:40:30] made to become
[1:40:32] a christian now remember who is saying
[1:40:35] these
[1:40:36] words this is a man this is the year
[1:40:39] 1961.
[1:40:41] this is a man who has seen the dead
[1:40:43] raised
[1:40:45] this is a man who has seen god
[1:40:48] take congressman upshaw which had been
[1:40:51] crippled for years and years
[1:40:54] and make him walk he'd seen florence
[1:40:58] nightingale which was only the skeleton
[1:41:00] of a person and see the dove come on the
[1:41:03] window and set on the window seal
[1:41:05] and god miraculously healer he had seen
[1:41:09] it in arkansas
[1:41:12] eight days and nights on the platform
[1:41:15] thousands of miracles seen it in south
[1:41:18] africa when they led this african boy
[1:41:21] and he was so out of his mind with a
[1:41:23] chain around his neck like a dog
[1:41:26] and he seemed the spirit of god after
[1:41:28] prayer raise him up to his feet
[1:41:30] and restore him in his right mind he had
[1:41:33] seen some of the greatest miracles that
[1:41:35] human eyes had ever behold
[1:41:38] and yet he says the greatest miracle
[1:41:41] that's when you
[1:41:43] are born again
[1:41:50] isn't it amazing many of us that are
[1:41:52] born again and yet we think
[1:41:54] we don't see no miracles
[1:41:58] every day you live in this earth and
[1:42:01] your birth holds
[1:42:02] itself it's a sustaining miraculous
[1:42:05] power of god
[1:42:09] let's bow our heads if you would
[1:42:13] oh jesus
[1:42:16] maybe there's some here today under the
[1:42:18] sound of my voice or some that
[1:42:21] have streamed this service today or will
[1:42:23] stream it from different parts of the
[1:42:24] world
[1:42:27] you love the lord and you go to church
[1:42:30] or
[1:42:31] maybe you're sick today and you can't go
[1:42:33] or
[1:42:35] but you believe that god's word is right
[1:42:37] and true
[1:42:39] as far as for you to say personally
[1:42:44] that you have this i'm not your judge
[1:42:49] but you just look at your own heart your
[1:42:50] own life
[1:42:52] if there's anything missing from that
[1:42:54] today
[1:42:56] why don't you ask father father
[1:42:59] please come please come
[1:43:04] i'm not standing outside of eden's gates
[1:43:08] as it were 4 000 years ago
[1:43:12] but i'm standing here in happy valley
[1:43:13] today
[1:43:16] i need you to pass my way and breathe
[1:43:20] into me lord god your life
[1:43:26] heavenly father as we bow our heads to
[1:43:30] the dust of the earth
[1:43:33] from whence we were taken
[1:43:36] if time would go on one day we will
[1:43:39] return
[1:43:41] but we're so thankful heavenly father
[1:43:43] that
[1:43:44] our man of genesis 1 when the man of
[1:43:48] genesis 2
[1:43:49] if we would relate it to us as well
[1:43:52] how many of our buried lord the years
[1:43:55] that i've been here over 30 years now
[1:43:58] how many of their bodies are laying over
[1:44:00] here at the cemetery
[1:44:02] bluntville kingsport sullivan county
[1:44:07] jonesboro but yet lord god
[1:44:12] when the life left their body
[1:44:15] that real spirit being that was inside
[1:44:17] of them
[1:44:19] in a moment was carried over
[1:44:23] to the other side and entered into a
[1:44:27] theophany body
[1:44:30] with the hope that their dust body will
[1:44:33] be raised
[1:44:34] again except this time it won't be
[1:44:36] animal life
[1:44:38] it'll be zoey life in the human body
[1:44:44] lord god if there's one here today or
[1:44:46] one who will hear this service
[1:44:49] they've never met you that way lord i
[1:44:51] pray you it helps them
[1:44:54] father we don't want to be religious
[1:44:57] we want to be born again lord we could
[1:45:00] be called by all kinds of names we could
[1:45:02] call her and
[1:45:03] church name all sorts of things we could
[1:45:05] belong to a denomination or organization
[1:45:07] or
[1:45:08] we could be known as followers of the
[1:45:10] message that's no more than just another
[1:45:12] term
[1:45:13] if we don't know you so lord we want to
[1:45:17] know beyond a shadow of a doubt
[1:45:20] that we pass from death unto life
[1:45:23] that we're not having to make ourselves
[1:45:25] live this life
[1:45:27] that it's you paul told the saints of
[1:45:31] his day that
[1:45:32] he desired to labor
[1:45:36] on them until christ
[1:45:39] would be formed in them
[1:45:44] so we know the further revealing of this
[1:45:45] word is
[1:45:47] christ actually is the new man
[1:45:52] of our soul the new man
[1:45:56] versus the old man
[1:46:00] lord jesus i'll worship you today
[1:46:04] i thank you father for my own personal
[1:46:08] miracle god you've allowed me to lay my
[1:46:12] hands on many many folks i've seen folks
[1:46:15] heal with cancer
[1:46:17] i've seen cross-eyed straightened out

[1:46:23] you've done
[1:46:26] lord god i thank you for my personal
[1:46:28] greatest miracle
[1:46:31] is changing me from a mixture of a
[1:46:32] reagan and a shoat
[1:46:35] and my first marriage that had to rule
[1:46:37] over me
[1:46:38] and somehow you got that nature to
[1:46:41] reason together with you
[1:46:43] and you killed it and the miraculous
[1:46:48] new birth started forming in me
[1:46:53] thank you lord jesus thank you lord
[1:46:56] jesus

[1:47:10] so many times
[1:47:11] but i know if i live long enough i'll
[1:47:13] get sick again
[1:47:15] but once you liberated me from my first
[1:47:18] husband
[1:47:19] and we talk about the husband dying
[1:47:22] that's only half of the equation
[1:47:24] not only did that first husband die but
[1:47:27] that person he's married to had to die
[1:47:29] together
[1:47:31] the whole union was annulled
[1:47:35] not only did our first husband which had
[1:47:37] to rule over us die
[1:47:39] but we died to death with him
[1:47:43] praise god and we were recreated
[1:47:49] and the image of god
[1:47:54] thank you lord jesus we love you today
[1:47:57] father
[1:47:59] we worship you lord god

[1:48:04] the presence of the great king

[1:48:09] you ought to be one of the happiest
[1:48:10] people
[1:48:11] that's alive on the face of the earth
[1:48:14] many people have gathered today in
[1:48:15] religious places and
[1:48:17] they've said the rituals and the
[1:48:19] routines many hindus have gathered and
[1:48:22] many people of islam they will pray
[1:48:25] several times today and put down their
[1:48:27] prayer rug and
[1:48:28] their face toward mecca and call upon a
[1:48:31] god
[1:48:32] who they call allah which does not even
[1:48:35] exist
[1:48:38] the shintos many the taoist many of the
[1:48:41] different religions of the world
[1:48:43] they will get alone and meditate and try
[1:48:46] to think the problems away
[1:48:49] think the seriousness of the state we're
[1:48:52] in a way
[1:48:53] but you and i couldn't think it away
[1:48:55] talk it away
[1:48:57] carry it away there's only one person
[1:48:59] that could take it away
[1:49:01] and that was our father
[1:49:05] praise god thank you lord jesus
[1:49:10] we worship you mighty god
[1:49:13] thank you for condescending so low lord
[1:49:17] that would you would come down to this
[1:49:19] earth not only become a human
[1:49:22] but become sin
[1:49:25] the snake on the pole
[1:49:29] angels would hide their face from you
[1:49:33] spirit god would hide man would
[1:49:36] curse and spit on you
[1:49:41] you'd be so out of the economy of god
[1:49:44] that it pleased the father to bruise you
[1:49:48] and lay on you the iniquity of us all
[1:49:53] but isaiah went on to say after you have
[1:49:55] made your soul
[1:49:57] an offering you will see
[1:50:01] your seed look this way today lord jesus
[1:50:08] we're not all of it but we're glad we're
[1:50:10] part of it amen
[1:50:12] look this way today lord god standing in
[1:50:16] this place
[1:50:18] or some of your seed
[1:50:21] we're able to stand here today redeemed
[1:50:24] because your soul was not only offered
[1:50:27] your soul was accepted
[1:50:32] hallelujah
[1:50:35] so you're able to go not only in place
[1:50:38] sacrificial blood and symbol upon the
[1:50:40] altar in hebrews
[1:50:42] as paul so beautifully declared it but
[1:50:45] your soul was accepted
[1:50:47] for mine then i become born again
[1:50:52] i receive a portion of you
[1:50:55] back in me glory to god
[1:51:01] we worship you lord god
[1:51:06] thank you lord jesus come and just
[1:51:08] worship him a little bit now saints
[1:51:10] walmart in his presence
[1:51:12] think of it any of you that used to sit
[1:51:14] around with a cigarette between your
[1:51:16] fingers
[1:51:17] a can of beer a bottle or whatever it
[1:51:19] was pills
[1:51:21] looking for happiness searching for
[1:51:24] something
[1:51:25] but jesus got a hold of your life
[1:51:28] oh he didn't eliminate all your problems
[1:51:30] we know better than that
[1:51:32] but he eliminated your biggest problem
[1:51:35] which was a soul problem
[1:51:37] your problem wasn't drinking your
[1:51:38] problem unsmoking
[1:51:40] it was a soul problem god accepted
[1:51:44] a work of his own hands in the
[1:51:47] mediatorial aspect
[1:51:49] to offer a soul in place of
[1:51:52] ours so that we could be
[1:51:56] born again and he would come by where
[1:51:59] you as a
[1:52:00] knelt down on an altar or out in a
[1:52:02] barnyard somewhere
[1:52:04] or wherever it was that he dealt with
[1:52:05] you
[1:52:07] and you were born afresh and you
[1:52:11] took the breath of eternal life
[1:52:16] never to die again
[1:52:21] oh jesus oh
[1:52:24] jesus
[1:52:28] how many appreciates that miracle of the
[1:52:30] new birth that's happened to you

[1:53:11] place written
[1:53:12] with your name on it it was on the
[1:53:15] outside
[1:53:17] and it said something like this upon
[1:53:20] pain of death any gentiles
[1:53:24] entering from this point on will be
[1:53:27] killed
[1:53:30] you had no right in the holy place
[1:53:35] you had no right in the holy of holies
[1:53:39] but upon pain of death he took it for us
[1:53:45] and said children don't stay out now
