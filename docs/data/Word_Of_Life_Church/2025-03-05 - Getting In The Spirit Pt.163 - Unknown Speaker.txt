tonight by the grace of God free from that we're truly blessed AR we yes amen let's turn if you would to the Book of Genesis tonight certain to greet you tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Carol and I pulled into the driveway out there and I said boy it's good to be back home I like going out every now and then and preaching visiting the saints of God and and different places it's good for me to go out occasionally it's good for you to hear somebody other than me amen two amen oh boy it does it all good whether you say Amen or not it does you good but there's just something about about being home praise the Lord I've got more invitations in the month of January for the year of 2025 and up into 26 and I've had in years and years and I don't want to go nowhere I want to just stay here at home but our lives are not our own are they sometimes we have to go and do things that that the we may not necessarily want to do herself but had some good meetings out in Arkansas brother Josh Bennett brother Willam awon just did an outstanding job that other guy you know I don't care for him very much so can't just judge too much about him but the Lord already moved among his people it was just awesome to hear the things that that God did that's a kind of God we're serving a it let's read together tonight Genesis chapter 1 we'll begin reading verse 11 and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the Earth herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so and the Earth brought forth grass in herb yielding seed after his kind so we got the fruit trees then we've got the herbs the grass whose seed was in its self was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good and now we know that what should have happened was then that God would have been able to continue on after he made the man in Genesis 2 and then God would have said and the man brought forth after his kind and it was good but something happened in verse 13 in the evening and the morning were the third day how may like to be remembered tonight as we pray I've gotten so many prayer requests from different people from different places around the world that's going through so many things so too many for them for me to be able to mention to you tonight but let's just remember the body of Christ around the world I hope you pray for the body of Christ when you do pray because there's so many needs Lord Jesus we count it such a great honor father that we would be able to sing that song that we just sung that we are free when we think of what we were the darkness that we were in the shackles father not just when we were lost but many of us come from a world that was lost and then we started out in a system somewhere or a church that just had part truth and we didn't realize that when we got sick saved that we were free from sin but we going back right back into tradition which is going to bind us up again and you're continually setting us as your children free I pray Lord that it would never become commonplace to us may it always be sacred and precious you see the word that we've read tonight Lord and you see what lays before us I pray that you'd help me to be able to get out of the way speak through me Lord God those things which be beneficial to your body we believe that we're in the last days and we know that there is a harvest cycle and we can see from the political world that's around us we can see from our nation the things that's going on in our country and around the world it is in a harvest cycle so we know that there is also a church cycle and if there is a church cycle then of course there is a bride cycle too so we pray that you'd help us as the people of God that we can receive the right seed and then also seow the rat SE speak to us from your word father I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus amen God bless you Saints you may be seated let's read again if you wouldn't mind in Genesis chap 2 verse 8 now what will come from the original establishment of God's God's promised word of his pattern of what he wanted to do and how that everything thereafter would follow the pattern that he just gave to us in Genesis 1:1 so then once God gives us something God is immutable God is unchangeable in his ways and if we can ever find the ways of God about something then we can Bank on it he'll never he'll never be able to to lose that so man once he became out of fellowship with God God was going to bring restitution to the man back to where he'd be able to worship and fellowship by the shed blood of an innocent one that was a law of God it's never changed to this day but now let's watch as we move from Genesis chapter 1 to Genesis chapter 2 now we know according to Genesis 1: 26 that there was a man that was made that man was not a man of dust but he was a man that bore the Heavenly image or the image of the Son of God now it was the son of God's image that he was made in not animal he was a spirit being in the image of God made he them male and female created him and he called their name Adam now we come from Genesis 1 126 and 27 over to Genesis 28 now watch and the Lord God planted a garden so wonder what the difference was now from Genesis chapter 1 when God said let this seed come and let it bring forth of its kind and then God planted a garden I want you to notice that the garden was separate from the rest of the earth now when Moses is writing about Genesis 1:11 what we just said there God said let the Earth bring forth of its kind let the tree having the seed within itself the grass with the seed within itself and the herb was in the seed Within itself but now we come to a spot that is called a little bit different thing it is called a garden now what does a garden signify a garden signifies a place of ground or dirt that is Sanctified it is set apart from the rest of the earth is it Earth it is but it's also called a garden now in that God is going to signify a great type of what he's going to do many many times and repeat it over again and the Lord God planted a garden so now Genesis 1:1 spoken word but here the Lord God planted a garden I want you to notice a difference now whenever we looked in Genesis 1:1 and God said not Lord God not compound Name Lord God God is compound Jehovah Elohim but in Genesis 1 it's God said so now in Genesis 2 we're moving into the time that God is dealing with his family and when God deals with his family he deals with them in compound Redemptive name so it was Lord God when the devil come to Eve in this Garden of Eden he did not use the compound Redemptive name of God but he used just the title or the name God now he wants to make him aart from Eve wants to make her feel that he's not really concerned about her everyday life and things that she's going through that somehow God is disconnected from them and it actually worked notice in in Genesis 2:8 and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward okay so the first thing we see then is that God calls this particular place a garden and then God picks a certain direction on the earth that he places the garden now we happen to know where this Garden was at least the country it was in Egypt it was in Egypt now God could have picked the north he could have picked the South he could have picked the west but the the Lord God chose the East and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden so now the prophet tells us that Eden would would have been like a state but the Garden of Eden was its headquarters now remember there was four rivers that went out of here there was a land and there was Pyon and there was havala and then the Bible tells us there that the gold was there and the bedel and all those different things and then God Sanctified and separated a portion of dirt on the planet Earth and he set that aside for special planting special planting now the rest of the Earth had already received the seed words of God and they had the ability to reproduce himself but a garden signifies a Sanctified place a special place and it would lead us to believe that in this Garden there would be particular types of plants now for those of you that will before long that have a garden around your house whether it would be a flower garden or a vegetable garden depending on the surroundings of your home since we have a lot of whet tail deer in Tennessee you may have to put up a little fence or you may have to put something to keep the the rabbits out or you may have to do this or that or the other so what does the garden signify it signifies a particular spot of the earth that you want to plant other plants that are separate from everything else and then in that because it is a place set aside and hallowed and different from everything else you may have to surround it with an enclosure so you may have to put a fence or you may have to put something there that will keep the things outside of it from coming in and destroying the garden so the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Edom and there he put the man whom he informed I want you to notice now about this place that Adam's Body actually did not come from the Dust In the Garden of Eden but it came from the state of Eden So Adam was not brought from the Dust In the Garden of Eden now remember these points so God creates all the Earth and then he makes this state called Eden and then God goes into this very special place and then he goes to planting certain types of trees and bushes and things that are going to be set aside and Sanctified and hallowed for him and and for his children now us read it again with that in mind and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed not created now remember the formed state of man is the state of Genesis 2 but the created state is the man of Genesis 1 126 but this man was the man formed out of the of the earth so he put him into a Sanctified state that he originally did not come from so he was called from this state of Eden and placed inside or his adoption his position in in the kingdom of God is going to be in this garden now watch in verse n and out of the garden out of the ground rather uh made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the side but I want you to take notice that he does not say this about the Earth in Genesis 1: 11 and 12 and 13 he doesn't mention the same adjectives and describing these particular ones but out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the sight so the trees in the garden of Eden must have been somewhat a a different species one that was more outstanding to the others now I know you're wondering where I'm going but when we get there it'll hit you like a bolt of lightning so there was certain trees and bushes and and fruit bearing plants and trees and and all types of herbaceous things that was on the outside but then when God Sanctified this certain spot and he made trees that actually even looked different so they were more pleasant to the sight so the Lord God had caused them to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the sight and good for food so notice the adjectives that's being used now to describe them so they were pleasant and they were good and they were good for food and the tree of life also is in the midst of the garden want again to pay particular attention that the tree of life was not out in the place of Eden the tree of life was in the Garden of Eden so if you and I are going to have eternal life we're going to have to get back in the garden amen because the tree of life is not just out here it's in Eden again now if we're going to have have eternal life we've got to get back to that tree so Moses now remember he was carried away into the presence of God to be able to write things that no other man in in the Bible ever wrote about and he says also the tree of life was in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil then look at verse 10 and a river went out of Eden to water the Garden so a river went out of Eden and once it goes out of Eden the state then it enters into the Garden of Eden and when it flows out of the Garden of Eden it's divided into four different branches so it comes from Eden originates in Eden flows through this Sanctified set aart garden and once it goes through the garden then it comes out in four administrations and divides as it goes from the land of Egypt down through shaar Babylon so on and so on and a river went out of Eden to water the garden and from thence it was parted and became into four heads now watch in verse 15 Genesis 2:15 and the Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden now watch positionally placed to do what so the Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of in notice again he's not formed Out of the Dust of the garden of in but positionally placed in the Garden of Eden and God's now going to describe what he's put there for he put him in the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it now his his position was not to to Grub his position was not to get out there and dig and and dig up weeds and you know have BRS and nettles and thorns and sweat and labor and just work and work and work no he was called to a very mild and GLE position in the Garden of Eden simply to just dress it dress it so there'd be certain things that he would just trim up or things that he would just move about a little bit but here's the catch word and he was also to keep it now this word is a word which means observe watch keep an eye on to behold to look at now remember this is his adoption so he's supposed to dress the Garden of Eden and he's supposed to keep it so that lets us know even though God did not say up to this time that there was any Fallen Angels Moses never wrote about that part but yet we know the Earth was brought into existence after the Angels had already fallen and Moses no doubt knew this but he just did not feel inspired to tell it at this time did God tell Adam we don't know but whether he went into detail or not to describe every particular aspect of it God gave him the key word keep so if you're going to keep something that means there's going to be something or some things or someone that's going to try to take away from you what you are supposed to keep right I mean it just Comm sense so whenever you and I get our inheritance in Christ Jesus we become saved Sanctified we move on in God we get the baptism of the Holy Ghost get a walk of God in our lives and then God will anoint the ministry to tell us to watch and to pray and to be careful and to pray and to read your Bible and watch The Devil he's like a roaring Li you know what they're doing to you they're doing to you the same thing that God did to Adam in the Garden of Eden so they're telling you to dress your inheritance dress your family dress your walk with God and keep it keep your eye open Pray read your Bible do those things that you were called to do and the church said amen so then God places the man here in this Garden of Eden and we know of course going on with the rest of the story that God brought the woman into existence so we can see that God's great plan for the man actually did not start in a church it did not start in a great cathedral made of cut beautiful stone and mosaics on the walls and all types of stained glass windows and things like that but it actually started in a garden and there was a cathedral okay but it was a Cathedral of trees so here was man positionally placed in the Garden of Eden but the man was not completely satisfied because of a missing part which needed to be taken out of himself and released in order to satisfy that part now of course a after that God knew that this would take place and then when man fell now remember he actually fell in the place of of his adoption he fell in the place that God had put him in so it wasn't like brother Steve that he he walked out of paradise and went back to the state of Eden and then fell and then come back to the Garden of Eden on his own he fell in his adopted position so he fell in the Garden of Eden which had now entered or started the first years or however long it was of a millennium now remember the seventh day God rested doesn't mean that God was tired but God stopped from all of his initial creative works of Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 so then God entered into the seventh day which was God's Millennium and this is why that we cannot go from the seventh Church CH age straight into eternity into the number eight because eight is eternal because the Millennium was put on hold but it must be restarted again wonder where it will be lived out in a garden what Garden will it be Mars Jupiter Pluto it'll be right back on this Earth again she'll be restored to her Eden Beauty at the dawn of that seventh morning praise be to God friends that's what we're waiting for now look if you would with me in Genesis chapter uh 3 verse verse 23 so after the fall therefore the Lord God sent him force from the Garden of Eden so now Adam and Eve as she is now called because she is the mother of all living and remember she did not get her own name until after she had fallen that's right he called her Eve after she had disobeyed God's word and before that time she was called Adam but she got her own name when she fell is that right which follows true with every church that's right but watch now the mercy of God being written even in the fall in the Garden of Eden therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden now the Hebrew word for Eden actually means pleasure pleasure so apparently there was a difference of the joy was it the brightness of the sunshine the greenness of the trees was it was it a temperature change what was it that was different from Eden versus the Garden of Eden because if all of it was exactly the same that would be no need to call the Garden of Eden the Garden of Eden if everything looked exactly the same you remember whenever uh Sarah when God told them that they were going to have a son and Sarah laughed at what God Said and she said shall I have pleasure with my Lord actually in the Hebrew Sarah says well I have eaten will I have eeden with my Lord again so you can imagine how father must have felt that day when this scripture was fulfilled therefore the Lord God but again pay attention to the word that Moses uses to describe him and he uses that compound name again not God Lord God therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he goes back to the very spot that he woke up that first morning notice where he sent back to after he falls so God sends him back to the very spot now it must have been quite alarming when the Lord God makes this man and the prophet catches a glimpse of and he said he stood there like a tree and his toes was like the roots of a tree down in the ground and his arms like the branches and there was no life in the man so he would have stood there maybe in resemblance of size to what we are today but he was just a bulk or a mass of tissue and senu and atoms and molecules and organs and hair and bones and fingernails and all of that but he was not yet a living being and the Lord God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Adam became a living Soul so when God breathed into him and he caught the breath of life and his eyes come open and then his being started by animation animation of the Breath of God he started feeling and his heart heart beating and his lungs going in and out and blood pressure and so on and so on and so on remember Adam was not a little baby boy but Adam was created a full grown man and now the Lord God after his Disobedience sends him right back to the spot notice where he goes back to therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to tell his position is now changed he is not now going to keep and protect or guard but he's not going to just trim around a little bit but now God uses a different word now he's going to till till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man listen how sad he drove he drove get out leave go oh how that must have broke his heart how that must have broke Father's Heart he let him in but drove him out how it hurts the hearts of parents when their children go astray and they're trying to find a way to deal with them you don't want to run them deeper into sin of course you don't want to compromise and you're trying to find that delicate spot but what I love about God was that God did not ride him off and say you know what you go Ahad and do whatever you want to do I ain't hanging around you no more but God took the action of his own son so instead of the Lord God staying in the garden and putting man on the outside side and changing the climate the temperature and changing everything on the outside of the garden and leaving the garden the same because all the animals of course were changed too some of them become carnivorous that never been before meat eaters so the lion looked at the lamb totally different after Adam fell everything had now changed those earth going to tilt on its axis soon after this and the seasons will start coming on the Earth but God did not leave the Garden of Eden and that original pleasure state but God so changed the Garden of Eden that it has disappeared believe me I've been to the land of Egypt you move out from the Nile you move out from Little oases that are here and there and there all you're going to see is Miles and Miles of sand where is that Garden of Eden that was in Egypt and God took his son and daughters shame and walked out with them if you can't be here I don't want to be here without you the Lord God did not want to be in Paradise alone oh my any parents said in this place tonight that knows if you've got a wayward child even though you're not doing what they're doing there is an element about you that will never be satisfied quite the same again until that son or daughter comes back to Paradise is that right oh may God help us as we deal with them but notice now the Lord God has to change his demeanor and it must have been quite frightening for the man he had never heard God raise his voice he had never heard God in a sharp demanding tone he had never heard his father with that something hairy that he would hear in his voice and when he heard him just walking in the garden in the cool of the day the man and his wife hid themselves from that presence oh my so so the Lord God now drives him drives him out of the Garden of Eden so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden chams and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life so now God puts angels and they're standing there turning turning don't you come near Adam stay away Abel don't you come near sth stay away don't come near I'll kill you Lord God children how grateful we are to be tonight to know one day that same Lord God that tree of life was born of a virgin and become a human being so tonight instead of trying to drive us away from the Tree of life he's standing here with the arms of the Tree of Life wide open saying come back children come on back with me to the Garden of Eden oh Hallelujah now but God after the picture now changes so from a a a garden of a perfect paradise and where that it was and as I said totally lost to men don't know where it's at all different ones hisop Babylons and different ones they have written about their idea where it was and you could go and spend the rest of your life in the land of Egypt looking searching looking searching I don't believe it'll ever be found but I do believe that God will restore it again I'm plan on living in it but God still wanted to use a garden in symbols in the Old Testament and also in the new now we've been talking about us sowing our seed and God sowing his seed and we'll we'll bring this back into view now that the Lord God SED his first seed son on the earth and he brought this seed's son into a garden of paradise so God sowed his seed in the womb of the earth and that son was Adam now every son should have come forth by that spoken word birth but God knew now that this would happen so God still wanted to use the symbol of a garden down through the scripture now let us turn if you with the Song of Solomon 4 verse2 now here is Solomon and the shulamite now remember I've told you before years ago whenever I took the the Song of Solomon and preached on it that that the Hebrew Brews the even the modern day Jews today will not let their children read The Song of Solomon because it is so plain until they become of Age The Song of Solomon was called by the Hebrew Scholars to be the inner sanctum or the holy of holies of the Old Testament books of the Bible so it is called canticles c a n t i c l e s canticles or the song of Solomon we don't know what the woman's name was but we know that a title one of the titles given to her was shulamite or schulas Smith either way Babylonian schula Smith shulamite Hebrew but shulamite is the is the feminist form of Solomon and wean know the story of the shulamite and how that Solomon came to her and found her and transformed her from a little girl that had lived a simple Country Life and was a shepherdess and she wasn't really thought very highly of by her parents apparently and by her brothers and she said about herself I am black but I'm comely so she was looked down on because fair skin during this time frame was very very lifted up and exalted so she'd been out in the herds and Out Among the sheep and so on so it took quite some some transition to where that this bride would move from a life of a country girl into palace life so Solomon had to constantly be able to try to transform her Thinking by giving her descriptive terms of his love now listen so he would constantly say things to her in order to Elevate her beyond what she thought about herself which is one to be one of our greatest challenges in this hour now by the time we move here to chapter 4: 12 he's entered into a pretty deep state with what he wants to the the bride to see what she is now listen what he says a garden enclosed is my sister my spouse a spring shutter a fountain seal now again keep in mind when we run this parallel of what a fountain a a garden a spring all of these plants what they represent so now he's identifying his wife as a garden well now you remember that Eve was a garden in the garden so Eden was a garden in the garden of the Earth the planting of the earth and this was a sacred hallowed Place set apart from the rest of Eden called a Garden of Eden a pleasure of Eden so now he is calling her also a garden but it's not just a garden but it's got special frames of words that he uses now he said a garden enclosed is my sister so she's not just a garden but she's in an enclosed Garden so the loveliness of the Bride is now set forth under the image of a garden that has been barred and separated from Intruders now remember the prophet tells us that the devil slid or crawled or something like that underneath the garden gate in the Garden of Eden so the Garden of Eden was also enclosed as you and I are tonight by the grace of God so inside the Garden of Eden was these rare exotic plants and beautiful trees and so on so Solomon takes the same descriptive terms to describe his wife now he sees in her a parallel now this is a common thing among the kings of the East that they would have a little special place sometimes it would be in the city walls sometimes according to the fertility of the land it might be outside the city wall but they would have a certain spot and it would be called The King's Garden a lot of times it would be near a source of water and the king would have a certain spot that he would drink and they would actually lock up that spot and no one could drink out of it but the king himself so he looks at the shulamite and he says that she is a garden en closed so she's watered by Abundant streams she has plants that are so rare and so exotic but then he also says that she's in closed so now we are not only like a garden that hopefully we are very fruitful and bringing forth what the Lord God wants us to bring forth but we are also a garden that is enclosed now keep in mind that if these Gardens were not enclosed they had wild pigs in the land remember the Bible says take us the little foxes for it is the little foxes that spoil the Vines Now the little foxes before they become mature what they would do is they would come in and start nibbling on the grape Vines it's peculiar the way they would do it because they would start right down at the very bottom and they would eat the BART because it was real young and tender and they would eat all that bark all the way around that vine and when they would do that the vine then would become open to all types of insects and many times the vine would actually die so the little foxes would then spoil the whole Vine so there were wild boar there were foxes there were Jackal there were different types of things so they would enclose the Garden in order to only let entrance be by certain ones and to keep everything else outside of it now I realize that people look at us today and they look at our sisters the way they dress they look at us brothers and the way we do the way we preach what we talk and so on they think them people are really weird and they think you know my I feel so sorry for them cuz they can't go here they can't go there that can't do this and the other you know there there's lots of things that we can do we just don't want to do them we just ought not to do it and they look at it as Prison Walls they're not Prison Walls to us it's our garden walls amen and it keeps uh all this out here of the world but skip it keeps it away from our delicate plants I don't know about you but I'm still growing you know a garden is a sign where things are growing is that right and you've got delicate stages of maybe Temperance and and delicate stages of godliness and delicate stages of a brotherly kindness and you've got to protect them and nurture them while they're in this growing stage so a very striking thing then of the garden here in the Song of Solomon is a similarity to what we looked at to the Garden of Eden so she was a plot of ground which had been been set apart from her mother her father her brothers from the country the North country from when she come from she had been pulled apart by the king she found favor in his eyes and he set her apart and Sanctified her to himself then he puts a a a fence around her and encloses her in his love and favor and mercy so she is a plot of ground that is Sanctified to receive the king sea so she's not common ground anymore amen she's not common ground anymore but she's now set apart now watch how he looks at her so he says now she is a garden an encl closed Garden so she's separate she's distinct from all the rest of the dirt the only thing that makes your dirt any different than anybody else's dirt is the grace of God and the grace of God pulled on you and I aren't you grateful that he did so now he wants to forbid entrance to not just everybody that would pass by as as I said those of you that will plant a garden before long and you want to keep an eye on what's there and you have to keep things out and and you don't want certain pests and certain bugs and this and that and the other so the king wants to have this garden enclosed to where the fruit will only be accessible to him no preachers no Bishops no popes only the king so it is a spring shut up a fountain sealed now watch this read again a garden enclosed is my sister my spouse my sister let me just blow you away from the get-go a Christian man should only marry one of his sisters a Christian woman should only marry one of her brothers he said brother da Lord have mercy what are you talking about you're answering to the bride of Christ i't talking about your flesh brother sh to the goodness you know that but notice the time that here he is called call in her first my sister my sister you see he himself it is Christ anointing Solomon in the parallel and the answering to the anot type of the New Testament that Christ sister will be born of the same father and have the same divine nature can't you see what why he cannot marry just church members the only ones that will be in the bride of Christ must be his sister praise be to God I was hoping y'all would get that oh my she is not only his bride but she is his sister sister by divine nature my sister my spouse so my sister is one by birth a partaker of the same nature now my spouse that is one that is by love or joined by a sacred tie of divine affection amen which cannot be broken sister by birth SP spous by choice sister by birth I'm the oldest of seven kids and I'm here to tell you I didn't get to pick a one of my brothers or one of my sisters and they didn't get to pick me and it's probably a good chance a good thing because they might not have picked me but you know what the Lord God knew all of his people that were eating dirt and he's the one who set them aside now God could have chose the state of Tennessee God could have knows Florida oh some of you all would have put the Garden of Eden in Florida you love Florida so much you'd move to Florida if I'd only moved down there and start a church forget it I don't like Florida none the seol can have it back that is a quote from what the prophet said some of you would want the Garden of Eden in Arizona but God put it in the land of Egypt it was the Lord God that chose it it was the Lord God that chose the rarest most exotic most Pleasant plants that he could have set everywhere in Eden but he didn't set them everywhere but he saved special ones to go in the garden itself the rarest of species the most beautiful and the most oh Hallelujah to God every church is not the same every person that say they love the Lord is not the same some belong to Eden and others belong to the garden of Eden praise be to God my sister by birth my spouse my choice my sister in communion my spouse in absolute Union with myself praise be to God let me reiterate it to you again only sons of God and Daughters of God a Son of God should only marry one of his sisters no unbeliever should ever be married to a Believer come on now the prophet said under no circumstances come on no sister that ever marry just a son of Eden she should wait and pray for brother Donnie my goodness I'm 20 some years old I'm waiting for him I'll tell you one thing it'll be worth the wait if you wind up getting a son of Eden instead of getting one of these Eden boys because you get one of them Eden boys and you're a daughter of Eden you're going to have two different desires you want to go to churches two different places you'll want to feed on different stuff you'll be feeding on bride food he won't want the bride food he'll want Church food he don't care if he even goes to church as much as you do cuz you're used to Delicacies you're used to exotic stuff come on somebody don't you understand why the Lord Jesus cannot marry everybody that says they're going to heaven everybody that says they're a Christian he's looking for his eeden bride by choice Glory Hallelujah the first term sister oh my implies kinship of nature can you imagine the Lord Jesus Christ Paul writing about him in the book of Hebrews and saying for which cause he is not ashamed to call them Brethren singing in the midst of the congregation he would sing among his brothers I ain't a low down wretched good for nothing sinner I have been changed I'm a rare exotic plant Hallelujah to God I am of my heavenly father's planting not of yours amen amen aren't you glad of that tonight so the spouse indicates another relationship all together by his choice you imagine Jesus when he told the disciples you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go forth and bring forth fruit oh when he raised from the dead he never called them brothers until he raised from the dead and he said go tell my brothers Hallelujah why the blood of the Lord God had been shed and the way back to the Garden of Eden had now been made he could officially call them who they are no longer will I call you slaves he called him in friends St John 17 and he was able to move up into a higher sphere there in the communion room but then after his resurrection not just friends not just servants not just Bond servants but Brothers Brothers Hallelujah you see this communion in the spouse stage is so powerful that the woman will forfeit her name she will forfeit her maiden name glory to God and be merged into the name of her husband Mr and M Donnie Reagan that's bad if you don't like Donnie or Reagan because when you get me you get my name can't you say why all these churches that don't want his name even in baptism they don't want it casting out Devils but we want it I said we want it you see what happens to the woman because of the forfeiture of what she is and her name and so on she merges into the person of her husband and brings a magnification to his personality glory be to God hallelujah thank you Lord God you see he loves us so much that he says come into me children by the absorption of my love come into me forfeit your titles of this and that and the other do away with your baptisms of this and that and the other oh my one of the brothers today think brother Joel Brown had posted on the on the minister chat we have here at the church and he somebody had ask Instagram about the water baptism and Instagram was able to go to the maybe banic encyclopedia and ask when it was changed from father son holy ghost from the name the Lord Jesus rather the father son Holy Ghost and even that encyclopedia had it right too bad a bunch of the churches don't have it right in the day we're living in oh my but he loves us so much that he says children come into me and be absorbed into my love take my nature my attributes come to Paradise my children don't just stay in the saved State called Eden don't just stay in the safe State you know with modern Christianity but come into Paradise oh I wish I was out by myself about right now I'd run and scream like a wild Indian and speaking a language that I don't know what I'm talking about hallelujah amen he has participated in our nature that we might participate in his now watch so he calls her a garden enclosed is my sister my spouse and then he says she is a spring shut up a spring shut up so a fountain which is reserved only for the king's pleasure it is said that there was a place from the guihan spring out of Jerusalem and they found that when Solomon was King and he would go there there frequently and drink and he designed a lock to be put and they had a gate around it amen it must have been one day he when he went down there and he took his key and whatever more he was the only one now that had the key other people might come to there and say let me in let me in but the King was the only one that had the key to the door it must have been maybe in a similar circumstance that he realized this is my shulamite this is my shulamite she is a fountain I notice he don't call her a sewer he don't call her Pond waterer he don't call call her you know brackish water he don't call her an old green scummy Pond but he calls her a fountain a fountain Hallelujah a fountain a sealed up Fountain locked behind a secret and the king is the only one that knows the mystery of the secret she is a garden enclosed a spring shut up look at all these adjectives that he's describing the bride with and all of them lead to one thing describing her Purity her set apartness from the world enclosed sealed set aside she is his and his own different Expressions to point out to Purity and the consecration of this bride to him alone none has yet tasted of this spring but the bride let me just tell you right now I give my ultimate and complete love to no one but Jesus Christ I love my wife my children my grandchildren I love my sheep I've got friends around this entire world thousands and thousands of them but I give my complete love to the Lord Jesus only he's the only one that I give everything I am I don't care what I would own what sport you might like you should give that ultimately to the Lord Jesus and nobody else football baseball basketball or whatever more should not have the key to your passions and your soul it should not be something that you love doing it should be Jesus Christ Alone that he is is the preeminent one and he gets that sacred spot from you that nobody or nothing else can ever have Oh Glory to God Sports cannot have that the things of the world cannot have that that belongs to my king no preacher in the message is going to get that I give that to the Lord Jesus only Hallelujah oh my now he's opened the door he's open the gate and what he's going to do we're invited to go in with him just for observation thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates was pleasant ah uhuh Pleasant same root word for the word Eden Hallelujah with Pleasant fruits you know love joy peace gentleness kindness thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates with Pleasant fruits camper with spite ner Spiker and saffron calamus and cinnamon was all trees of frankincense myrr and alos that remember much of what he is describing is not indigenous to Israel but some of these plants actually come from other countries oh Kenya Tanzania India Kentucky Ohio I wasn't indigenous to church I never went till was 12 years old many of you wasn't indigenous to church or religion were you Carol Carol wasn't indigenous to church many of you were not indigenous it wasn't raised in your family in other words to go so you were brought from another country as it were and you have been transplanted into the garden of paradise of the king Oh Glory to God and once he brings you from there and places you positionally in the body of Christ oh I wish to goodness that we as the people of God could understand this we've got Ministers of different types and different sorts some that preach 90 M an hour some that preach 2 some that teach some that treat some that preach some that jump some that holler some that shake one leg some that shake the other leg some that shake two legs I'm not sure how they do it but they Shake two legs but we've got such an indigenous Variety in the bride of Christ but we want everybody to be like our favorite or we want every Church to be like ours shame on us he does not mention just one tree he does not mention just one Bush but it was a variety come on give the Lord a hand oh my nerd and saffron calamus and cinnamon with all trees of Franken sense myrr and alow with Chief spices now because we're westerners and most of these words don't mean nothing to us I just read to you Treasures from a king's Palace the average Israeli or Jew would have never even smelt these things in the span of their lifetime these were some of the most exotic and rare perfumes Hallelujah they could only dream about it oh ner and saffron calamus and cinnamon but all trees of frankincense myrr and alows with all the chief spices I want you to notice it ain't a bunch of dirt bags it ain't a bunch of trash you go down to the dumpster and see if you can find some kind of spice somewhere he said my bride smells like the chief that's that's right my bride smells like spikenard and alows and Ms and cinnamon my my I mean she ain't Big Lot she's right on top she's five star Hallelujah a fountain of gardens a whale of Living Waters not just a whale but a well of Living Waters oh I think of what Jesus said If any man will believe on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow a well or a river of Living Waters he's describing his bride and where in the world did she get this do you think she's born thinking this no it must have took maybe months or even years to get her past the mentality I'm not worthy I'm no good I'm low down can you imagine her coming from the country and them trying to teach her how to walk gracefully in the palace she was not just one of the concubine churches she was the one that he loved the most but she was a shepherdess so she'd run out there and grab them sheep and throw them down and man I'm imine she's roughing a cob she just how tell you one thing little sheepy come over grab him water man over and say whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa that ain't the way you do in the palace really that's something I know Hallelujah where's that sheep at where's that wolf at where's that Old Goat I'll smack him up the side of the head no no no no no you've got to learn how to walk I don't how to walk well that might be

your face away from me oh I can remember him saying that but I didn't understand what it was you mean that's what he meant that's what he meant he just caught the side profile of your face and he was overwhelmed well I guess if he loves me that much I could try I don't mind telling you friends I don't understand why he puts up with us some of us been serving God for decades why in the world he puts up with us he's got to say a whole lot more about us than what we can see ourselves he called you a fountain and not just a fountain but a fountain of gardens a well of Living Waters streams from Lebanon you know that country right now that you're reading about nearly every day in the news where hezb is up there from right there you see Mount Hermon is up in that northern part of Israel the elevation is real high still got snow on it right now about the only place in Israel where they're getting much accumulation and it will build up pretty deep in the winter time and then it'll start melting in the warm days of spring and it'll start pouring into the Galilee into the Jordan River emptying down and he said my sweet love you are like the rivers from Lebanon but remember Lebanon was not only known for its rivers it was known for its cedar trees it was from Lebanon that Solomon had to bargain for the cedar to put in the House of God and it was a cedar tree that my beloved bridegroom hanged on a cedar across across between white wood and Redwood so your king hung on a cedar to redeem you little shulamite so what are you you are a garden in this Garden Church but you are

that God will send some god-given messenger and he after he's gone from the earth someone else will catch that message and hbed it don't you understand this is going to be part of our trial in the

and the the Apothecary was the only one who knew the mystery of what was inside of that the portions they were forbidden to wear it in their homes you couldn't buy it in the market because it was made by certain men who had received the instruction from God's Prophet so much of this and so much of that truly the god called God ordained men of this last day that really have an understanding of what this message is and they're feeding on that unfailing body word of the son of man they're taking so much grace with so much Mercy with so much forgiveness oh yeah we got to have a little bit of strictness we got to have a little bit of that legal part but not to be Armenian and not to be calvinist but so much of this and so much of that to anoint the bride with a Divine fragrance of almighty God so the north and south wind can merge in the garden and it will carry the fragrance oh no doubt hallelujah hallelujah it will be the bride's fruits the bride's fragrance the bride's maturity the
