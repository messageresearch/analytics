[22:47] in a land far away time Stood Still long
[22:54] ago there were sheepers in fields or at
[22:59] least this is how the story
[23:05] Goes The Story
[23:10] Goes woman with child and and in with no
[23:18] room born in a manger for
[23:23] telling a tomb this is how
[23:29] The Story
[23:32] Goes but it's more than a
[23:36] fable and it's more than a fairy
[23:41] tale and more than my mind can
[23:49] conceive I
[23:52] believe the wise men
[23:56] saw the little child the Angels called
[24:01] the Son of
[24:04] God Heaven's

[24:18] pierced
[24:20] hands he may
[24:24] youel has come

[24:37] believe
[24:38] 2,000 years still the
[24:42] story lives
[24:45] on God's gift to us sent to Earth
[24:50] wrapped in flesh his only
[24:55] son his only son
[25:01] and the heartbeat of
[25:04] Heaven
[25:05] confounded our
[25:08] wisdom but it's still the simple truth
[25:12] that Set Me
[25:15] Free I
[25:18] believe the wise men
[25:22] saw the little child the Angels called
[25:27] the son Son of
[25:30] God Heaven's
[25:34] child The Great I
[25:38] Am born to take away my sin through nail
[25:44] pierced
[25:46] hands
[25:50] Emmanuel has
[25:54] come and I believe
[26:01] [Music]
[26:05] preious
[26:06] child how can it be that God's great
[26:13] plan for his

[26:52] child became a
[26:56] man he gave his Li for me in spite of

[37:18] them uh because I want to be in
[37:21] compliance with the word any Christian
[37:22] wants to be in compliance with the word
[37:24] and um I looked at every store for from
[37:28] Ernie Solin and every outlet and
[37:30] couldn't find anything and my wife lo
[37:32] and behold goes into a consignment store
[37:35] and uh this is what she found so you
[37:39] have a sense of humor
[37:41] [Laughter]
[37:43] sir
[37:45] amen
[37:47] amen isn't he good to us here where it
[37:50] is Wednesday night of all the places
[37:52] that we could be we're back here in the
[37:54] house of God um we're so blessed we're
[37:57] so blessed his presence is here we're
[38:00] here together we're all in anticipation
[38:03] expecting to hear something from him
[38:05] expecting him to work in our lives and
[38:07] uh I know I need it myself I'm not just
[38:09] here preaching I'm here to I hopefully
[38:12] I'll get preached to a little bit myself
[38:13] and he's just such a good God he's so
[38:16] mindful of us brother Justin that I was
[38:18] sitting back there in the back and just
[38:20] I was nervous and like Lord have I
[38:22] missed your mind and then brother Justin
[38:23] starts singing his song and uh
[38:28] all right all right we're on point so
[38:30] let's let's have church tonight I'm
[38:32] going to do my part I'm going to give it
[38:33] everything that I've got tonight and I
[38:35] just ask that you do your part give give
[38:38] him everything that you've got get
[38:39] behind this word and I I I'm definitely
[38:43] a weak vessel I'm probably the weakest
[38:44] vessel that we have of the minister
[38:46] Brothers here at the church but um I
[38:48] believe he's a big God and I believe
[38:49] that I can step aside and he can say
[38:52] something that you need to hear I
[38:53] believe that he can work in your life
[38:55] whatever it is that you need him to work
[38:56] on so let's have church
[38:59] tonight if you would turn with me to
[39:01] book to the book of Hebrews chap 1
[39:04] verses
[39:07] 1-4 promis I'd wear it I didn't say how
[39:12] long thank you buddy those things are
[39:15] just so
[39:19] uncomfortable Hebrews chapter 1 verse
[39:23] 1 God it says God who at sundried times
[39:26] and in diverse manners spake in time
[39:29] pass unto the fathers by the
[39:31] prophets hath in these last days spoken
[39:33] unto us by his son whom Heath appointed
[39:36] heir of All Things by whom also he made
[39:39] the worlds who being in the brightness
[39:41] of his glory and the express image of
[39:44] his person and upholding All Things by
[39:47] the word of his power when he had purged
[39:49] himself purged their sins sat down on
[39:51] the right hand of the Majesty on high
[39:55] being made so much better than the angel
[39:58] as he hath by inheritance obtained a
[40:00] more excellent Name than they and I want
[40:03] to look at that word person the express
[40:05] image of his person that word person
[40:08] comes from the word I'm going to try to
[40:09] say hypostasis which means the
[40:11] substantial quality or nature of a
[40:15] person or thing tonight we're going to
[40:16] be talking about the nature of
[40:20] God as it we pray uh let's all um keep

[42:37] you and it's in Jesus name that we pray
[42:42] amen you may be seated I almost forget
[42:45] that part every
[42:46] time um I going to start off with this
[42:48] quote who is this
[42:50] 1959 brother brandom said what if
[42:53] Abraham would have took what it looked
[42:55] like 25 years waiting for a promise that
[42:58] God gave him why he he would have never
[43:00] had the baby they never they would have
[43:04] never uh had had been the father of
[43:06] little Isaac but he believed God's word
[43:09] and wouldn't turn it loose but he
[43:11] watered it day and night strong giving
[43:13] praise unto God ohen Sarah would say
[43:16] honey it's been 25 years since since the
[43:19] promise was made here I am nearly 100 he
[43:22] would say praise God we're going to have
[43:24] it anyhow cuz God said so and that
[43:26] settles it that's right he said he
[43:29] knowed the nature of
[43:32] God because he was a friend of God
[43:34] that's talking about a
[43:36] relationship he know the nature of God
[43:39] because he was a friend of God he knowed
[43:41] how to take him he knew how to take God
[43:44] he knew how to take his mannerisms his
[43:45] ways he understood
[43:49] God because he he knowed that his
[43:52] promises no matter how foolish they
[43:53] looked or how simple they looked or how
[43:55] unreasonable they looked they were true
[43:59] because God said so and that settled it
[44:01] forever now I think about this great man
[44:04] of faith that we've been preached on I
[44:07] mean countless times there's no way you
[44:09] could possibly know the number of times
[44:11] that this the faith that this man has
[44:13] been preached on and talked about and
[44:15] we've looked to him to to get that his
[44:17] story to give us strength and um he's
[44:20] even to the place that he's referred to
[44:22] as the father of the faithful and James
[44:24] chapter 2 actually referred to him as
[44:26] the friend of God you know what a
[44:28] compliment that is to be called the
[44:30] friend of God you have such a
[44:31] relationship with him and to be he can
[44:34] we can dep he we can depend on him but
[44:37] to know that God can depend on
[44:40] us um he was referred to as the friend
[44:42] of God Romans chapter 4 says uh speaking
[44:46] of Abraham says that who against hope
[44:48] believed in believed in hope that he
[44:50] might become the father of Nations and
[44:53] being not weak in faith he considered
[44:55] not his own body which was now dead and
[44:59] it skips on down it says he and he
[45:00] staggered not at the promise of God
[45:03] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[45:06] giving glory to God and being fully
[45:08] persuaded that what he had promised he
[45:10] was also able to a able to
[45:13] perform this great man of
[45:15] Faith the key to that Faith the key to
[45:19] his ability to hold on to the promise of
[45:22] God for 25 years with absolutely nothing
[45:26] changing with no improvement when it
[45:29] seemed like there was no encouragement
[45:31] um maybe things go the wrong direction
[45:33] for 25 years this man held to the
[45:36] promise of God and the key to his
[45:37] ability to do that was because he knew
[45:39] the nature of God he knew the nature of
[45:42] God he knew how to take God he
[45:44] understood
[45:47] him and that was through relationship
[45:50] now everything has a nature every living
[45:52] thing has a nature every every human
[45:55] every animal has a nature that defines
[46:00] it your nature is literally the
[46:03] definition of you if I could look you up
[46:06] um if I could look you up brother if I
[46:08] could look you up uh Caleb Davis and I
[46:10] could look you up in a dictionary your
[46:13] what would be the definition of Caleb
[46:15] Davis your your nature defines you to
[46:17] others it lets you know what this man's
[46:19] all about what's he like what's this man
[46:23] really really like um is the nature
[46:27] the nature of God is what what what what
[46:29] gave Abraham this great faith now the
[46:31] word nature we're going to look into
[46:33] this just for a minute try to get rid of
[46:35] this mint that is
[46:38] like not nervous honestly I was but I'm
[46:41] not
[46:42] now the the word nature is the complex
[46:45] of emotional and intellectual attributes
[46:48] that determines a determine a person's
[46:51] characteristic actions and reactions and
[46:53] that's important you know what CU re
[46:57] actions and the reactions that you know
[46:58] what to expect from somebody based on
[47:00] their
[47:01] nature it says the inherent character or
[47:04] the basic constitution of a person or
[47:06] thing the disposition or the temperament
[47:10] now everything has a nature every human
[47:12] has one every animal has one and I I
[47:14] think about even even the animal life
[47:16] they all have natures and you think
[47:18] about your pets and so on and I think
[47:20] about the different of natures between
[47:21] between everybody's either typically a a
[47:24] cat or a dog person and uh one is a a
[47:27] cat is a snotty stuck up creature and a
[47:30] a dog when you walk up into the room
[47:31] thinks M my goodness the Lord himself
[47:33] has walked into the room and they have a
[47:35] nature that defines them that lets you
[47:37] know what to expect out of this animal
[47:39] you what type of behavior to get from
[47:41] them and hey if I do this this is what
[47:43] that animal is going to do in response
[47:45] and nature tells you a whole lot about
[47:47] us there are all kinds of emotional and
[47:50] as it says the emotional and
[47:52] intellectual attributes that kind of
[47:54] kind of Define each one of us we uh um
[47:57] uh you know self-awareness how
[47:58] self-aware are we um you know knowing
[48:01] your strengths and weaknesses we none of
[48:03] us tend to really know that really
[48:05] really well we all uh we all either way
[48:07] underestimate or way overestimate
[48:09] ourselves and and our abilities um your
[48:13] motivation what type of motivation you
[48:15] have as part of your nature um are you
[48:18] selfmotivated do somebody has to drag
[48:20] you along that teaches people what to
[48:22] expect from you um empathy or your can
[48:26] you empath with people when they're
[48:27] going through things are your social
[48:29] skills um are you an out outgoing person
[48:33] are you an introvert it teaches people
[48:36] your nature teaches people what to
[48:38] expect from
[48:40] you your
[48:42] humility um um teaches people do do you
[48:47] understand and know your limits and your
[48:48] infallibility your weak can you
[48:51] understand your weakness um your honesty
[48:55] can you be trusted can you be unbiased
[48:58] all these things make up our natures and
[49:01] they Define us it defines me to you MD
[49:04] carway it tells you this is what Pete
[49:06] Lawson is so if I do this this is how
[49:10] Pete's going to respond if I if I if
[49:13] this certain situation comes about this
[49:15] is how Pete's going to react why because
[49:17] I know his nature I know what to expect
[49:20] but from Pete if someone were to to bust
[49:22] through bust through his door and and to
[49:24] threaten his family I know Pete's nature
[49:26] so I know what to expect from
[49:29] him your nature defines you to others
[49:33] God's nature also defines him to his
[49:37] people we all have a disposition we all
[49:40] got a personality right everybody's got
[49:42] a personality um something that uh some
[49:45] people got big personalities some people
[49:47] are uh um unfortunately um that's why I
[49:50] try to keep quiet I've got a big
[49:52] personality um don't mean nothing by it
[49:54] um I feel like I could take on um I
[49:58] could I could fight a troop by myself
[50:00] and I I love challenges as I said before
[50:02] and I um I'm bold and I I just wish
[50:05] sometimes Pete just shut up you know
[50:08] just learn to shut up but it's I've got
[50:10] a nature I've got a personality that
[50:12] kind of defines me to the people that I
[50:15] that know me and uh to my wife and my
[50:17] kids and my my friends my brothers and
[50:20] sisters we all got a
[50:22] disposition which is your mood it's it's
[50:25] uh and compare me and my wife my wife is
[50:28] one of the sweetest people honest the
[50:29] sweetest person that I've ever met in my
[50:32] life and I'm I'm more known for I've
[50:33] been told I was born with a scowl from
[50:35] the day that I was born um I'm a very
[50:38] determined person um and uh um I'm I'm a
[50:42] little more Surly a little more abrupt I
[50:44] I generally say what's on my mind where
[50:46] Bambi will always try to say the nice
[50:48] try to be nice and say kind things to
[50:51] she CU she thinks about people's
[50:52] feelings and I think if you ask you
[50:54] really meant you really want to know so
[50:56] um and I tell her I said listen darling
[50:58] if you don't want to know what what what
[51:00] your dress looks like or the outfits
[51:01] you've got on looks like if you don't
[51:03] really want to know cuz if you ask me I
[51:06] think you really want to
[51:09] know I've got a nature that defines me
[51:12] she should have learned by now to quit
[51:13] asking me that you know you know but we
[51:16] all we've got we all got a temperament
[51:18] which is kind of like your emotional
[51:20] ronse to situations and if you don't
[51:22] think you got one um take a hammer and
[51:25] smash your finger real good and you'll
[51:27] find out you do have a temperament
[51:29] you'll find out uh this is how I respond
[51:32] um when when I'm in pain when I'm in
[51:34] danger when uh um if you get here's a
[51:37] good one if you get cut off in traffic
[51:38] or you got some knucklehead that is in
[51:40] the left lane you know doing 50 m an
[51:44] hour in a 70 and you got a parade about
[51:46] 100 miles long it feels like behind you
[51:49] you'll find out what type of a what type
[51:51] of temperament you got right we all have
[51:55] a temperament that defines us to other
[51:57] people it lets them know hey you know
[51:59] what I could probably do this with with
[52:01] Pete and get by with it or maybe with
[52:03] Pete I probably wouldn't want to do that
[52:05] you know maybe somebody's really
[52:06] sensitive someone that's a really
[52:08] sensitive person you got to be careful
[52:10] with what you say to them you because
[52:11] you don't want to hurt their feelings so
[52:13] you got to kind of guard your words a
[52:14] little bit more but someone to say like
[52:15] John hornak was a good friend of mine
[52:18] you can pretty much just just let it
[52:19] roll with John you cannot offend him you
[52:21] can't embarrass him um but I know his
[52:23] nature that teaches me how to have a Rel
[52:26] relationship with him yeah am I making
[52:29] sense so far that's we all got a fight
[52:31] or flight response when we get scared um
[52:35] we all got one I've seen grown men 6'4
[52:37] 250 lbs when they get scared scream like
[52:40] a little girl that just saw the devil in
[52:41] in their closet you know curl up their
[52:44] you know I've seen women that you would
[52:47] think would scream when they got placed
[52:48] in a situation like that handle it just
[52:50] take it on the chin and not even not
[52:52] even Flinch but we all have a response
[52:54] to these things and it lets people
[52:56] know this is this is how this is a type
[52:59] of relationship these are the guidelines
[53:02] this kind of helps me set boundaries in
[53:03] our relationship with this person God
[53:07] also has a nature that teaches us what
[53:10] type how to how to have a relationship
[53:12] with him what to expect from him and I'm
[53:14] going to go a little slower than I
[53:15] normally do um I promise the Lord that I
[53:18] I tend to come out like a like a like a
[53:21] Brahma Bull ready to fight and I just
[53:23] promise the Lord I'm going to try to
[53:24] just slow down and let him try to follow
[53:26] the leading of the Holy Ghost um we all
[53:30] have habits that Define us uh we all get
[53:33] up in the morning we have our morning
[53:35] routine uh which tells our our spouse
[53:37] and our family this is what uh maybe in
[53:40] the morning this is what they do so this
[53:41] is what I can expect and my wife loves
[53:43] her loves her coffee so I can always
[53:45] expect her to be near the coffee pot
[53:46] when she wakes up and we all have things
[53:49] that we do habits that Define us and and
[53:53] it teaches people how to have a
[53:54] relationship
[53:57] our integrity your honesty do you keep
[54:01] your
[54:02] word come on now when you give it see
[54:04] your word is going to be everything to
[54:06] people or your word is going to be
[54:08] absolutely nothing to people and we get
[54:09] to decide that you know your integrity
[54:12] your honesty um your work ethic will
[54:16] will will Define you I I I think about
[54:18] many years ago I worked with brother uh
[54:20] brother Mike Lunsford and we were out on
[54:21] the um brother Ben is back when I worked
[54:24] with you and you had loan me to Mike and
[54:26] we were cutting a salvage yard down in
[54:27] South Carolina and these people don't if
[54:30] you're on their Sal on a salvage yard
[54:32] cutting these converters they want to be
[54:34] there with you CU they want to see
[54:35] what's coming out of their yard because
[54:36] that's there's a lot of money involved
[54:38] in this and uh brother Mike I noticed
[54:40] these people let Mike come in after
[54:42] hours while they were
[54:43] gone because that man had such a
[54:45] reputation and he his integrity was so
[54:48] strong they knew I can leave my gates
[54:50] open and let him come in here and cut
[54:52] these converters and I know he won't
[54:53] miss paying for a single one right
[54:57] you know do you keep your word when you
[54:59] give it to
[55:02] people these all Define us they teach
[55:05] people how to have a relationship with
[55:09] us we all got our little
[55:12] quirks our little our little uh little
[55:15] Oddities about us you know like eating
[55:17] fries first which is the only way in the
[55:19] world you're supposed to eat fries
[55:20] whenever you have a hamburger and fries
[55:22] you eat your fries first um um I I'll
[55:26] stand by that the lines on the sidewalk
[55:29] I I don't know why but I have to step
[55:31] over those things it just it bothers me
[55:33] to step on a line uh um Times New Roman
[55:36] there is no other font to use um other
[55:40] than Times New Roman we all know it's
[55:41] the best obviously um we got these
[55:44] quirks these little little things about
[55:47] herself that just teaches people this is
[55:49] what lost in his like so here's what I
[55:52] can here's what I can do with him here's
[55:54] what I can't if this happens I know
[55:57] exactly how he's going to
[55:59] respond all of these
[56:02] things teach others how to have a
[56:04] relationship because of our habitual
[56:06] response to
[56:08] situations God also has a nature and I
[56:11] know I keep saying that but I'm just
[56:12] going to drive it home I'm trying to
[56:14] just trying to imprint the my thought
[56:15] into your mind he also has a nature and
[56:18] by his nature we know exactly what to
[56:21] expect from him now I know we've got the
[56:23] word now you may say well why do we need
[56:25] to know know the nature of God when we
[56:27] have the message we have all all the
[56:29] Mysteries um uh that uh that have been
[56:32] revealed to us and all the doctrines
[56:34] that we understand and um the things
[56:37] that have been given to us why do we
[56:39] need to know the nature of God when the
[56:41] word literally has been unfolded to us
[56:43] why do we need to know and I'll say this
[56:45] it's because he is coming back for his
[56:50] queen that lady who knows him not just
[56:54] knows about him him not just knows what
[56:58] is written about him not just knows the
[57:00] Mysteries and understands the doctrines
[57:02] but he is coming for that woman that
[57:05] knows him in a very intimate intimate
[57:09] way she knows what he's like she knows
[57:13] the Integrity of this man that she has
[57:16] chose to marry herself to
[57:20] amen not just any
[57:23] woman this is a love story you have to
[57:27] read the word of God like a love story
[57:29] brother Brenham said the Bible is like a
[57:31] love
[57:32] letter you have to read between the
[57:34] lines and see what that and see what it
[57:37] means not add to
[57:40] it to get the heart of what's being
[57:42] talked
[57:44] about example when the when the word
[57:47] gives us instruction on how to live Our
[57:49] Lives Many people get offended by that
[57:53] many people hear hear the the things
[57:55] that with the when the Lord just starts
[57:57] cutting things and cutting and cutting
[57:58] and dealing with our lives but she hears
[58:01] his love looking out for her protecting
[58:05] her trying to lead her back to him right
[58:08] trying to get her to the other side
[58:10] because he is anxious he is anxious for
[58:13] that day when he when we can be together
[58:15] as we should
[58:17] be many women I'll say it that way
[58:20] churches people individuals have read
[58:23] his
[58:24] letters because they Bel believe that he
[58:26] was talking to
[58:31] them and they became offended by his
[58:34] words because they they didn't read it
[58:36] they didn't there was no love
[58:38] relationship
[58:40] there they accused him of being
[58:43] controlling and telling her how to wear
[58:45] her clothes and and how to live our
[58:46] lives and how to conduct ourselves and
[58:49] they became
[58:50] offended but she understands what he's
[58:53] doing there is one woman who understands
[58:56] what he said when what his word is
[58:58] saying when when when the word starts
[59:00] cutting Our Lives she understands his
[59:03] love my wife understands me like nobody
[59:06] else his wife understands him like
[59:10] nobody else amen I think of my wife when
[59:13] she goes out and she knows that I've
[59:15] seen things that she hasn't seen and
[59:17] I've seen a little bit of the darker
[59:18] side of life so when she goes out I I
[59:21] kind of give her instruction when uh she
[59:23] goes out shopping I'm just when you get
[59:24] to a spot check in with me
[59:26] hey I'm at Target I'm at Ross I tell I
[59:29] teach her to to take different routes
[59:31] when she goes out and um because I when
[59:34] I worked in Corrections we were taught
[59:35] to you know take different routes to to
[59:37] and from work and wherever we were going
[59:38] because uh these inmates would have
[59:40] people to follow
[59:41] us um to try to to try to make you and
[59:44] try to get to your family so they get to
[59:45] get you to do things that were um you
[59:48] know just uh not above board
[59:50] and I instruct her be careful text me
[59:55] let me know when you're at this spot so
[59:56] that I know if if if you if if you go
[59:58] silent I know what your last location
[1:00:01] was now that might seem extreme and and
[1:00:04] and and
[1:00:05] but if I was to tell another sister here
[1:00:08] hey sis I want you to text me when you
[1:00:10] get to such when you get to each
[1:00:12] location now she might think that's
[1:00:14] creepy she
[1:00:16] should she
[1:00:19] should but my
[1:00:23] wife she understands what she knows what
[1:00:27] my husband has seen she understands she
[1:00:29] knows he knows things about this world
[1:00:32] that I don't understand I know that
[1:00:35] man's looking out for me I know he's
[1:00:38] protecting me she hears my love in the
[1:00:41] instructions that I give
[1:00:44] her she hears the love of God in his
[1:00:48] instruction she does not take offense
[1:00:51] when the word cuts on her life she
[1:00:55] understands what he's doing
[1:00:56] doing that don't mean it don't hurt but
[1:00:59] she understands she gets
[1:01:05] it have no idea where I'm at
[1:01:13] now knowing a person gives secret
[1:01:16] insight into that
[1:01:18] person there's a hidden me hidden
[1:01:20] meaning to their words you know I can
[1:01:23] say something too to my wife or my kids
[1:01:26] and they understand exactly what daddy's
[1:01:28] talking about sis you understand what
[1:01:29] I'm saying they understand my ways my
[1:01:32] mannerisms um they they just they get me
[1:01:35] they know what I'm they know what I'm
[1:01:37] about um they understand the hidden
[1:01:39] meaning behind my words um M your
[1:01:42] Expressions all of us have Expressions
[1:01:44] that you're that PE the people in your
[1:01:45] life they can read your Expressions the
[1:01:47] people that really know you they even
[1:01:48] know what you're thinking based off of
[1:01:50] your expression even when you're silent
[1:01:53] they know what they they they can know
[1:01:54] many times what you're even thinking
[1:01:56] about me and my wife all the time will
[1:01:59] uh I know when my wife's hungry and I
[1:02:01] and I generally know what she wants you
[1:02:03] know we'll be driving down the road and
[1:02:05] it just it just comes to mind I'm like
[1:02:07] you hungry darling say yeah I am I
[1:02:11] Subway she said yep you know but because
[1:02:14] I know her we we've walked a long time
[1:02:18] together almost 24 years now and we've
[1:02:21] learned each other we've come to
[1:02:23] understand each other um we can talk
[1:02:26] when no words are being said um we can
[1:02:29] read each other's uh I can I can read
[1:02:31] her her Expressions uh um all these
[1:02:34] things all of them speak volumes if you
[1:02:38] know the person
[1:02:42] right as I said
[1:02:44] before knowing a person helps set
[1:02:47] relationship boundaries basically it let
[1:02:50] you know what I can and what I can't do
[1:02:53] with this individual
[1:02:57] nobody nobody knows me like Miss Bambi
[1:03:01] Marie knows me and nobody knows
[1:03:05] him like she knows him
[1:03:08] right she knows his Secrets he's
[1:03:12] revealed him to her she knows what he
[1:03:15] likes and what he don't like because
[1:03:18] they've walked and they've had
[1:03:19] relationship and he's and he's talked to
[1:03:21] her and he's and he and he's guided her
[1:03:23] and and just kind of just let her see
[1:03:25] him in in the in the day to day she
[1:03:27] knows this man
[1:03:31] yes
[1:03:33] how how how can she know him so well
[1:03:36] because she has walked with him through
[1:03:39] through many
[1:03:41] roads through many trials through many
[1:03:44] tests through many hardships and and and
[1:03:47] through all of that it has taught her
[1:03:49] one thing that her God will never fail
[1:03:53] her our God will will never turn his
[1:03:57] back on us he has proven it through his
[1:04:00] actions his word has declared it but his
[1:04:03] actions declare it even louder to
[1:04:08] me he will never turn his back on you
[1:04:11] brother
[1:04:14] Justin she knows his
[1:04:18] Integrity she knows what type of man if
[1:04:21] I can say it like that that he is
[1:04:28] because she knows his
[1:04:30] nature brother Bron said now I in in the
[1:04:33] latest de see in church as he said I've
[1:04:34] often Illustrated about my wife when she
[1:04:36] writes me a letter he said I can see
[1:04:38] what she's saying on that
[1:04:39] letter he said I read between the lines
[1:04:42] to know what she means see he said see
[1:04:44] because I love her I know her nature and
[1:04:48] you have to know God's nature and love
[1:04:51] him and then the
[1:04:53] scriptures will stand right out to you
[1:04:56] yeah he is coming again friend I'll say
[1:04:59] it he's coming again very soon I believe
[1:05:02] for that woman who gets him and then to
[1:05:06] me that's important just because I I
[1:05:09] want to be understand understood I I've
[1:05:11] got an odd type of Nature and when
[1:05:13] you're 64260 and got this you know uh uh
[1:05:17] people see that and they think you're uh
[1:05:19] you're an Axe Murderer and whatever more
[1:05:22] I like it's it's nice to be understood
[1:05:23] it's nice to have somebody that gets you
[1:05:25] to under that understands you that
[1:05:27] actually can see the real
[1:05:30] you
[1:05:36] amen he is not coming for the woman who
[1:05:39] fell in love with the men that he sent
[1:05:43] to tell her about him and understand
[1:05:45] what I'm saying I appreciate all these
[1:05:48] Great Men of God that he's given to the
[1:05:50] Bride of Jesus Christ I I appreciate our
[1:05:53] pastor very much uh uh the the the trust
[1:05:56] that he's he's given me to to to feed
[1:05:58] his sheep when he's gone I I that
[1:06:00] overwhelms me at times and I I
[1:06:02] appreciate all these men but they do not
[1:06:05] replace Jesus Christ
[1:06:12] amen we must remember that we are
[1:06:15] following a person not a written
[1:06:19] word not a written word only he's alive
[1:06:23] he's real he's living and breathing he's
[1:06:26] a real living being amen and he desires
[1:06:30] to be loved not just a rob a robotic
[1:06:33] following he desires to be loved by his
[1:06:36] people he desires you to love him
[1:06:38] because you choose to love
[1:06:40] him not because you're made to love
[1:06:44] him John chap 1 John chapter 1 says if
[1:06:47] we walk in the light as he is in the
[1:06:48] light we have Fellowship one with
[1:06:50] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:06:53] his son cleanses from sin if we follow
[1:06:57] this person of
[1:07:01] light and I liken it to this we're we're
[1:07:04] following here in this life we're we're
[1:07:07] following him through a very dark place
[1:07:10] trying to get to the other side and
[1:07:14] sometimes it's it's uh it's so dark
[1:07:17] honestly it feels like I can't see him I
[1:07:18] don't feel him I don't hear him um I
[1:07:21] feel at times I can't see him I wonder
[1:07:24] Lord where are you at
[1:07:27] come
[1:07:30] on what happens if we lose sight of that
[1:07:32] light just for a moment you lose sight
[1:07:35] just in the darkness you can't see I
[1:07:37] know what his word says but I don't I
[1:07:40] don't see it like I need to see it I
[1:07:43] know his word says that he's my healer
[1:07:46] but I don't see it like I ought to see
[1:07:47] it I don't feel it at
[1:07:53] all how do we get back to
[1:07:58] him we know his nature I know what type
[1:08:02] of man he is I know he's a man of the
[1:08:05] highest Integrity I know he's a man that
[1:08:08] keeps every word like he said he would
[1:08:11] that's right and by knowing his nature
[1:08:14] that guides me back to his
[1:08:17] word he can always be found in his
[1:08:22] word we go through so many dark things
[1:08:24] in our lives
[1:08:27] as I said you can't see him hear him
[1:08:29] feel him I mean sometimes you feel like
[1:08:31] I'm am so alone where are you have you
[1:08:34] turned your back on me have I fallen so
[1:08:37] bad that you want nothing to do with
[1:08:43] me how can we be certain when you were
[1:08:47] going through that that he will be where
[1:08:49] he said he would
[1:08:51] be when you know his word but you just
[1:08:54] can't see see it when it just doesn't
[1:08:57] make sense and I and I think about our
[1:08:59] brother brother Eugene
[1:09:02] Kennedy uh to the to the outside looking
[1:09:04] in it don't make no sense for a man to
[1:09:07] have that kind of Faith to hold on the
[1:09:10] way that that brother did and to confess
[1:09:12] like he did and and and and the Lord
[1:09:14] worked in his life like he did and it
[1:09:16] doesn't make no sense for it to end the
[1:09:18] way that it did to someone that does not
[1:09:21] know him that's offensive yeah yeah
[1:09:26] but we know him and we can see that that
[1:09:29] was a crowning of a
[1:09:30] life the Lord he use that to just
[1:09:34] squeeze all of that that everything that
[1:09:37] he wanted all of that perfume that was
[1:09:39] in my brother's life to squeeze it out
[1:09:41] of him we can see that this was a son
[1:09:45] being uh just coming to his PL just
[1:09:48] being placed that was the crowning of
[1:09:50] brother Eugene Kennedy's
[1:09:53] life knowing him
[1:09:56] knowing him guides us back to his word
[1:09:58] throughout all the through all the
[1:10:00] confusion and all the pain and all the
[1:10:03] questions and I don't understand why
[1:10:05] this is happening I don't understand
[1:10:07] what's going on in the world today I
[1:10:09] don't understand what's going on in my
[1:10:11] life whatever it might
[1:10:16] be I know
[1:10:18] him and though I cannot feel him I trust
[1:10:21] him
[1:10:23] yes I know him because I have walked
[1:10:25] many miles with this man as I as we
[1:10:28] would say no disrespect you understand
[1:10:30] what I'm saying I've gone through trials
[1:10:32] that just it almost nearly broke my mind
[1:10:35] and you can relate we can all relate in
[1:10:37] some way I've made so many mistakes yes
[1:10:40] I have fallen on my face so many
[1:10:45] times and when I fell I saw his
[1:10:50] response I saw his response to when I
[1:10:53] would fall and I would see that every
[1:10:55] single time I felt he was there
[1:10:57] sometimes he with a gentle word telling
[1:10:59] me Pete Pete stand up and give me a hand
[1:11:02] to help me up sometimes a stern word
[1:11:05] telling me to stand up and fight but
[1:11:09] every single time every single time he
[1:11:13] was there right not one time has he has
[1:11:16] he abandoned me not one time has he ever
[1:11:19] abandon you you are here tonight because
[1:11:22] of the grace of God not because of your
[1:11:24] own good
[1:11:25] not because you are so
[1:11:28] strong it's because of
[1:11:33] him and through all that I've gone
[1:11:35] through my mistakes and my flops it's
[1:11:38] taught me one
[1:11:40] thing he will never fail
[1:11:43] me he cannot fail his people he will
[1:11:47] never turn his back on
[1:11:52] us there is nothing like the great
[1:11:55] faithfulness of our
[1:12:01] God my goodness Abraham this great man
[1:12:06] of
[1:12:07] Faith he learned the nature of God
[1:12:10] through his
[1:12:11] failures he learned the nature of God
[1:12:14] and that gave this man faith not faith
[1:12:17] in himself he gave him faith that he's
[1:12:19] going to do it he promised me that he
[1:12:22] was going to do it and he's going to do
[1:12:24] it because when we think about Abraham
[1:12:26] and the scripture says he staggered not
[1:12:28] at the promise of God through unbelief
[1:12:30] but then I look at his life much like
[1:12:33] ours I see when he was called to come
[1:12:36] out of heran historians say it was
[1:12:39] inwhere 5 10 15 years that he
[1:12:41] lingered because he didn't want to
[1:12:43] separate from his
[1:12:45] father then we see that he goes into the
[1:12:48] land and and and things get hard and he
[1:12:50] runs to Egypt and and gives saraah away
[1:12:52] you know the story now I to ask you this
[1:12:54] who who who turned that situation around
[1:12:58] who fixed that did Abraham did Abraham
[1:13:01] line up and fix things no because God
[1:13:04] had swore to this man I will make you a
[1:13:07] father of Nations and I'm going to see
[1:13:09] to it right it's my responsibility to
[1:13:13] see the work in your life completed
[1:13:19] [Music]
[1:13:21] amen Abraham's
[1:13:23] failures I think about
[1:13:26] ishmail and what a curse that is to the
[1:13:29] people of God even to this day we see it
[1:13:30] going over going on over in the Middle
[1:13:34] East I said again see the his failure
[1:13:36] with ailec and again giving his wife
[1:13:38] away when things got tough and these
[1:13:41] failures they taught Abraham I can trust
[1:13:44] him yeah not only do I believe in him I
[1:13:46] can trust him he's going to keep his
[1:13:49] word in spite of the weakness of My
[1:13:51] Flesh in spite of how much I might fall
[1:13:54] how how depressed and down I might get
[1:13:56] and discouraged he's going to keep his
[1:13:58] word to
[1:14:01] me he said
[1:14:03] he the
[1:14:04] key he swore by himself not by
[1:14:11] Abraham in Genesis chapter 15 we can
[1:14:13] read about the that that that white
[1:14:15] light how that that this the the Lord
[1:14:17] commanded Abraham to part the carcasses
[1:14:19] and lay their bodies and we we hear
[1:14:21] about this white light coming down and
[1:14:23] part and passing between those those
[1:14:25] carcasses now that was an old old I
[1:14:27] can't say the word herian custom I think
[1:14:29] is the right word when two men were
[1:14:31] making a would be making a vow between
[1:14:34] one another they would take these
[1:14:35] animals and they'd part the carcasses
[1:14:36] and lay one to this side one to that
[1:14:38] side and then they would pass through
[1:14:40] each man would pass through and say let
[1:14:42] me become as these dead carcasses if I
[1:14:45] fail to keep my word yeah when it came
[1:14:48] time to make this vow with Abraham he
[1:14:50] put him to sleep said it has nothing to
[1:14:53] do with you Abraham and that white light
[1:14:55] came down and and walked between these
[1:14:58] carcasses and almighty God was was
[1:15:01] reaffirming to Abraham that let me I
[1:15:04] I'll say it like this Abraham let me
[1:15:07] almighty God become as these dead rotten
[1:15:12] carcasses if I fail to keep my word with
[1:15:16] you that is how Abraham held
[1:15:21] on he knew his God would not fail him
[1:15:25] Abraham didn't begin with no great faith
[1:15:27] his faith grew yes as he walked this
[1:15:30] life and he failed and as God stepped in
[1:15:32] time and time and time again and now
[1:15:34] we're going to switch gears CU I'm going
[1:15:37] to try to speed up man to time is a
[1:15:40] flying now God has many
[1:15:44] attributes in himself that he throughout
[1:15:46] the eternity he's desired to express and
[1:15:49] we all know this but I'm just going to
[1:15:50] rehash a little bit and we we understand
[1:15:53] that uh there was a time that he was
[1:15:55] alone and he he wasn't even God it was
[1:15:58] just all Darkness except for that great
[1:16:00] light and um he was alone with his
[1:16:03] thoughts it's all it was there just him
[1:16:05] and his
[1:16:07] thoughts there was nobody there to
[1:16:09] express them these thoughts too he was
[1:16:11] the self-existing one all alone with
[1:16:15] these things within himself that he
[1:16:17] wanted me and you to know
[1:16:20] yeah and it was there in that place that
[1:16:25] he elected each and every one of us that
[1:16:27] that are elect children of God tonight
[1:16:29] it was there in that place that he chose
[1:16:32] us and he and and it was there in that
[1:16:34] place that he decided I will not let
[1:16:37] this person be lost thank you Lord I
[1:16:39] will not let this person
[1:16:44] fall his mind was made up then that he
[1:16:48] was going to see us
[1:16:50] through John chapter chapter 1 says in
[1:16:54] the beginning was the the word and the
[1:16:55] Word was with God and the Word was God
[1:16:59] that
[1:17:01] logos the same one that met with Abraham
[1:17:04] in the form of
[1:17:07] MDC the same one that met with Moses and
[1:17:10] said Moses I'm going to let you see me
[1:17:12] but you can't see my face and he put his
[1:17:15] hand over his face as he as he passed by
[1:17:18] and as he lifted his his hand as he
[1:17:20] walked by and Moses could see him from
[1:17:22] the
[1:17:23] back and that very same one was made
[1:17:27] flesh in our Lord Jesus
[1:17:31] Christ the scripture says that all
[1:17:33] things were made by him and without him
[1:17:35] was not anything made that was made he
[1:17:38] began to
[1:17:41] speak and he believed his own word and
[1:17:44] literally everything that was created
[1:17:47] came came to
[1:17:50] pass brother brand said the very ground
[1:17:52] that you said over tonight is the word
[1:17:54] of of God
[1:17:56] materialized he believed his own
[1:18:00] word his faith in his own word produced
[1:18:03] every bit of this now I want to ask you
[1:18:05] a question how in the world can it
[1:18:08] possibly fail us
[1:18:10] now if his word can do that how can it
[1:18:14] fail you today and at the as we close
[1:18:16] out
[1:18:22] 2024 I got to find where I'm at
[1:18:27] how can he fail you when you need
[1:18:29] healing you need Deliverance
[1:18:32] yeah he's not going to fail us when it
[1:18:35] comes to the changing of our bodies amen
[1:18:38] he's not going to let you down he's
[1:18:40] going to do what he said he would
[1:18:44] do he desired to be God back when he was
[1:18:48] all
[1:18:49] alone and that desire led to him
[1:18:51] creating angels and he became an object
[1:18:54] of worship and we know about the fall
[1:18:56] and how Lucifer was lifted up and he he
[1:18:58] turns I think it's 2third of the Angels
[1:19:01] against him and there was a war in in
[1:19:03] heaven and Lucifer was cast out and and
[1:19:05] I'll just say this to you um this is
[1:19:08] part of why Lucifer hates us so bad and
[1:19:10] I keep trying to to mark my spot because
[1:19:12] my eyes they jump around I had issues
[1:19:15] with dyslexia all my life and it uh the
[1:19:17] words jump sometimes so I'm uh I
[1:19:21] apologize but that's why Lucifer hates
[1:19:23] us so bad one one time one time he made
[1:19:27] a
[1:19:28] decision and he's eternally damned for
[1:19:32] it and he watches us every single day of
[1:19:36] Our Lives fall on our face make mistakes
[1:19:39] lose our temper lose our
[1:19:42] patience lazy growing cold yeah and yet
[1:19:46] he watches us Time After Time the grace
[1:19:49] of God is given to
[1:19:51] us and he hates us for it
[1:19:55] that's fine I hate him too I
[1:19:58] mean we look he as he continued on the
[1:20:01] Lord be God began to create the heavens
[1:20:04] and the Earth and making everything that
[1:20:05] he uh he rolls back the the darkness and
[1:20:08] and says let there be light and he rolls
[1:20:10] back the waters and he says let the
[1:20:12] Earth bring forth which means to Bud
[1:20:14] which shows the patience of God he
[1:20:17] didn't he didn't just speak a full grown
[1:20:19] tree he had he planted the seeds in the
[1:20:21] ground and he said let it bring forth
[1:20:23] and these seeds slowly
[1:20:25] this seed slowly grew into this great
[1:20:27] giant Oak he's a very patient
[1:20:31] God he created the sun and the moon and
[1:20:33] the
[1:20:34] stars all the life that's in the water
[1:20:37] and uh and and the and the great Wells
[1:20:39] and the birds and all the cattle and the
[1:20:42] Beast of the field and all the creeping
[1:20:44] things and he desired somebody to share
[1:20:47] all this with he wanted somebody like
[1:20:51] himself and he said let us make men
[1:20:55] in her own image and and and he and he
[1:20:57] forms Adam from the dust of the earth
[1:20:59] and I I believe it's brother Donnie I
[1:21:01] heard years ago talking maybe to
[1:21:03] dramatizing Adam just being this
[1:21:06] lifeless form with his toes dug down in
[1:21:08] the dirt like a tree and can you imagine
[1:21:11] what it must have felt like when when he
[1:21:12] breathed the breath of life and Adam's
[1:21:15] eyes open for the first time I mean my
[1:21:19] goodness I can relate to it to a degree
[1:21:23] yeah
[1:21:28] they began to take their walks in the
[1:21:30] garden with this
[1:21:32] man having these conversations like a
[1:21:35] good father
[1:21:36] will he's a good
[1:21:40] father began to share his responsibility
[1:21:42] with his son letting him name his
[1:21:45] creation and um I've I've heard it
[1:21:48] dramatized how that they'd be walking
[1:21:50] through the the garden and Adam could
[1:21:52] had the ability of the spoken word to
[1:21:54] say that tree just doesn't seem right
[1:21:55] and he could speak to it and and uproot
[1:21:57] that tree and plant it over here because
[1:21:59] that just seemed like the right spot for
[1:22:01] it because he so had the mind of God and
[1:22:04] um he loved sharing that responsibility
[1:22:07] with his son see to the desire to be a
[1:22:10] father is a part of his nature and if
[1:22:13] you've got a good father that helps you
[1:22:15] understand him a little bit
[1:22:18] tonight and he placed men as as we go on
[1:22:21] I'm trying to speed up on on the basis
[1:22:23] of free moral agen see see he wants to
[1:22:26] be loved as I said by
[1:22:32] choice then he sees Adam
[1:22:35] lonely and I believe he understood how
[1:22:38] Adam felt because he felt the exact same
[1:22:41] way he knew Adam was longing for
[1:22:43] somebody he didn't even know who she was
[1:22:46] he had a longing inside of him for
[1:22:50] something and the Lord puts a deep sleep
[1:22:53] on him and and he performs operation and
[1:22:55] he takes out of his side uh this this
[1:22:59] this this Bride named
[1:23:02] Eve and the Lord lifts this anesthesia
[1:23:05] from from Adam and he opens his eyes and
[1:23:08] he sees her for the very first
[1:23:10] time I can't imagine how that must have
[1:23:12] felt actually I can I remember the first
[1:23:15] time I saw my
[1:23:17] Bambi at the old church sitting out in
[1:23:19] the parking lot um second service that
[1:23:22] I'd came here to Happy Valley and my
[1:23:24] niece Donna was out talking to some of
[1:23:26] the young girls and I I go go to get my
[1:23:28] niece Donna and there's this girl
[1:23:30] standing at the bo at the back of their
[1:23:31] uh at the back of their her mom and
[1:23:33] dad's van and I knew in that moment I
[1:23:35] was going to marry that
[1:23:41] girl you see the desire to be a husband
[1:23:45] is a part of his nature and he's a good
[1:23:49] one then we see man fall in the garden
[1:23:52] when Eve was deceived by the serpent I
[1:23:54] won't go in into it too long because
[1:23:55] it'll take too much time and uh we see
[1:24:00] the story tell about how here he is
[1:24:01] running through the garden and um and
[1:24:03] he's crying out Adam Adam where are you
[1:24:09] at and here Adam's afraid and he's
[1:24:12] because he he realizes he's naked and
[1:24:14] he's tried to cover himself with fig
[1:24:16] leaves and and
[1:24:18] uh here and the the Lord has this this
[1:24:21] conversation with him and he drives him
[1:24:22] from the garden and I believe that was
[1:24:25] killing killing his heart just
[1:24:27] absolutely aching his heart so bad and
[1:24:30] another great attribute came out of
[1:24:33] him and he and he took and he slew a
[1:24:38] lamb and he wrapped him in coats of
[1:24:40] skins of this lamb and he said I'm going
[1:24:43] to put enmity between you and the
[1:24:45] serpent seed I will bring you
[1:24:48] back because he is by nature a redeemer
[1:24:54] now get it out of your mind that he does
[1:24:56] things that are separate from his nature
[1:24:58] his nature is perfect and brother R said
[1:25:01] it never changes our nature might change
[1:25:04] but his nature will never
[1:25:13] change he is a
[1:25:15] redeemer by
[1:25:17] Nature we see the prophets over the
[1:25:20] course of time and all of them were
[1:25:22] partial reflections of this great
[1:25:24] this great nature of God as he would uh
[1:25:27] I think about Noah when we see the the
[1:25:32] uh sorry I got to focus my eyes again
[1:25:36] Noah and the and the justice of God and
[1:25:38] Abraham and the election of God and we
[1:25:41] see Moses and in the Deliverance of God
[1:25:43] and we see David and uh David the king
[1:25:46] but we also see just in just mindblowing
[1:25:49] Grace and forgiveness that was given to
[1:25:50] this man and we see the prophet Hosea
[1:25:53] and and and and just think about this
[1:25:55] just crazy Reckless Love between a man
[1:25:59] and a woman where he just cannot let her
[1:26:01] go and we see him expressing himself
[1:26:03] through each of these and with each and
[1:26:05] every single one of them he might be
[1:26:07] expressing multiple attributes but each
[1:26:10] and in each and every one of them
[1:26:11] there's one attribute that he
[1:26:13] continually expressed and that is his
[1:26:15] faithfulness to his people and to his
[1:26:21] word when he should have turned when he
[1:26:24] could have he had every right to turn
[1:26:26] his back on him he refused because he is
[1:26:29] faithful faithfulness is a part of his
[1:26:40] nature
[1:26:44] now when this fall thought first came to
[1:26:47] me many many years ago and I preached it
[1:26:48] a couple times and I preached it to the
[1:26:50] young people once here years ago and
[1:26:53] then I deleted the file and said I ain't
[1:26:54] never doing that again and and uh so uh
[1:26:57] when the Lord put this on my heart
[1:26:59] needless to say I was uh I can't
[1:27:01] remember a whole lot brother Rob if it's
[1:27:02] like the one before or not I don't know
[1:27:10] um the way that it came to me was I in
[1:27:13] my mind I saw this
[1:27:15] eagle and I could see it flying just
[1:27:18] flying out out out just way way out in
[1:27:22] the heights of the air and and these
[1:27:24] words came to me Eagles are Flyers by
[1:27:29] Nature nobody teaches an eagle to fly
[1:27:32] nobody makes an eagle to fly they just
[1:27:35] do it because they're
[1:27:42] Eagles there are many things that are
[1:27:44] part of his
[1:27:47] nature and he does them just ca he
[1:27:50] because it's who he is
[1:27:52] yes just as as much as an eagle
[1:27:55] flies as a fish
[1:28:00] swims as a horse runs because it's their
[1:28:03] nature to do it he is by nature many
[1:28:05] many
[1:28:07] things brother Brenham said his nature
[1:28:09] can be defined by by love God is a is a
[1:28:13] god of
[1:28:14] love when he brother said when he seen
[1:28:17] the sin of the world and he seen that
[1:28:18] men was dying without hope and couldn't
[1:28:20] be saved yet he knowed that men would
[1:28:22] would love him he said it strained God
[1:28:25] and it proved his nature God is love God
[1:28:30] is love and it strained God's nature
[1:28:31] until he had to provide a way of of
[1:28:34] Escape for those that wanted to to
[1:28:36] escape and he sent his son into the
[1:28:39] world and that very that that that
[1:28:42] attribute of his nature is what led to
[1:28:45] the condescension of
[1:28:48] God the highest of
[1:28:50] highs became so low and so humble
[1:28:55] another great attribute of his
[1:28:59] nature and he John 3:16 Says that God so
[1:29:03] loved the world that he gave his only
[1:29:06] begotten son did you notice it said he
[1:29:08] so loved the world not just those that
[1:29:12] would accept him right those that he
[1:29:15] knew would turn him down those that he
[1:29:17] knew would never give him the time of
[1:29:19] day would never accept him accept him
[1:29:22] and he still loved them so so much he
[1:29:25] said I'm going to do it anyway I will
[1:29:28] become a
[1:29:30] man and I will pay their
[1:29:33] price so that they can be saved if they
[1:29:36] want to
[1:29:40] be poor
[1:29:44] homeless an illegitimate name despised
[1:29:48] and rejected of men yet he did it
[1:29:51] anyway because he is humble by Nature
[1:29:54] he can lower himself so down he can
[1:29:57] lower himself down tonight I don't care
[1:30:00] where you're at tonight I don't care
[1:30:02] what you face tonight I don't care how
[1:30:04] low you are tonight he has the ability
[1:30:07] to Humble himself down and come to you
[1:30:09] right where you
[1:30:10] are there is nothing that you can throw
[1:30:13] in front of him that he can't help you
[1:30:15] with
[1:30:19] tonight I think about the story of Mary
[1:30:22] Magdalene and this is reveals another
[1:30:26] great attribute of his nature we all
[1:30:29] familiar with the story of this little
[1:30:30] woman was a prostitute and uh the dirty
[1:30:34] life that she had led and we're familiar
[1:30:36] with the story of how Simon had had
[1:30:38] Jesus to come to his house to to make
[1:30:41] fun of him and to mock him and to um to
[1:30:44] be rejected even the foot the footwash
[1:30:46] flunky had nothing to do with him but
[1:30:48] Jesus went anyway he went anyway why did
[1:30:52] he go for one he'll go where get where
[1:30:54] he's invited to go but there's another
[1:30:56] reason and I believe it's because she
[1:30:58] was there that going to be there that
[1:31:02] night and he is A Savior by Nature if he
[1:31:07] can find a heart that will let him in
[1:31:11] and let him have control I believe he
[1:31:14] can save anybody right here right now
[1:31:19] amen you have not fallen so far in grace
[1:31:22] that he cannot reach down down and pick
[1:31:24] you out of
[1:31:35] it I think about the woman of the well
[1:31:37] at the
[1:31:39] well I believe he was there that
[1:31:43] day at that time for one reason because
[1:31:47] she was going to be there and he knew a
[1:31:51] daughter of God needed him and he came
[1:31:54] even though he was busy no doubt he was
[1:31:57] tired because he is A Savior by
[1:32:03] Nature he is also a Healer by
[1:32:07] Nature brother random said if he ever
[1:32:09] was a Healer he's still a Healer amen if
[1:32:12] he ever was a savior he's still a savior
[1:32:15] if he ever was God he is still God
[1:32:19] tonight everywhere that he went he
[1:32:22] healed people yes sir
[1:32:25] I think about the crippled
[1:32:28] man couldn't walk so they lowered him
[1:32:30] through the
[1:32:33] roof they to literally tore the roof
[1:32:36] they believed in him so
[1:32:38] greatly they tore the roof off this
[1:32:41] building because they could not get this
[1:32:43] man to Jesus and they lowered him
[1:32:46] down and when Jesus saw
[1:32:49] that he it doesn't say he saw that man's
[1:32:52] faith
[1:32:54] let this give you hope if you've got
[1:32:56] lost loved ones
[1:32:58] tonight maybe their faith ain't going to
[1:33:01] ain't moving
[1:33:02] nothing but he saw their faith amen and
[1:33:05] he looked at this man and he said Son
[1:33:08] your sins be
[1:33:15] forgiven
[1:33:17] why because someone needed him needed a
[1:33:21] savior and he is by nature
[1:33:25] a
[1:33:26] savior someone needed him they needed a
[1:33:30] Healer and he is by nature A Healer amen
[1:33:34] if you will just meet him on the grounds
[1:33:36] of faith and take him at his word I
[1:33:40] believe that he can heal anybody of
[1:33:42] anything tonight
[1:33:48] amen he is a provider by
[1:33:51] Nature the scripture says he fed the
[1:33:54] with we're familiar with the stories of
[1:33:55] feeding the thousands with just a few
[1:33:57] fish and loaves of bread but he wasn't
[1:34:00] doing that to show
[1:34:02] off the scripture says he felt
[1:34:05] compassion he felt compassion for these
[1:34:08] people because they'd been out all day
[1:34:09] long and they were tired and they had a
[1:34:13] need and he was very aware of that need
[1:34:16] that is why we have the story of the
[1:34:19] Loaves and
[1:34:20] Fishes because he is by nature a
[1:34:23] provider
[1:34:24] there is no need that you could have
[1:34:26] that he can't meet tonight amen I've
[1:34:29] told this story before and I don't know
[1:34:31] if you if I mention it here or not but
[1:34:33] years ago me bamb when we first got
[1:34:35] married we didn't have two nickels to
[1:34:36] rub together hardly and we heard brother
[1:34:39] Jess and they it was the weekend that
[1:34:40] they take up their their missionary
[1:34:42] offering and we had just filled up the
[1:34:44] car um with gas and I was going to be
[1:34:48] able to get me home from Ohio and ready
[1:34:50] for my work week
[1:34:56] and brother J was taking up this
[1:34:57] offering and as I sat
[1:34:59] there the Holy Ghost spoke to me and
[1:35:02] said write a check for
[1:35:05] $52 so Bambi looked at me I had no Bambi
[1:35:08] took care of the bills I had no idea
[1:35:10] what we had baby looked at me she said
[1:35:11] what do you want me to write it for I
[1:35:12] said write it For
[1:35:14] $52 she said babe that's literally every
[1:35:18] penny that we've got we have exactly $52
[1:35:21] I said write the check she wrote the
[1:35:23] check for this missionary offering For
[1:35:27] $52 when we got home there was a check
[1:35:30] in the mailbox a
[1:35:32] doctor had he felt had sent us a check
[1:35:35] for
[1:35:37] $52 because he felt like we'd overpaid
[1:35:39] on a bill and he wanted to reimburse us
[1:35:42] who in the world ever heard of a doctor
[1:35:44] doing something like that he is a
[1:35:45] provider tonight he is very aware of you
[1:35:51] tonight amen
[1:35:54] he is a deliverer by
[1:35:59] Nature we're familiar with the story of
[1:36:01] the Canaanite
[1:36:03] woman who had a daughter that was
[1:36:05] grievously vexed with the Devil the
[1:36:06] scripture says and when she came to
[1:36:09] Jesus he ignored her and then when he
[1:36:12] finally did speak to her he said you
[1:36:13] ain't nothing but a dog and it ain't
[1:36:15] right for me to take the children's
[1:36:17] bread and give it to a
[1:36:19] dog and this little woman
[1:36:23] her faith was so strong she said that is
[1:36:25] exactly right Lord I ain't nothing but a
[1:36:27] dog but even a dog eats from the crumbs
[1:36:31] that falls from their master's table see
[1:36:33] she had the right attitude toward the
[1:36:35] promise of God and that right attitude
[1:36:38] toward the promise of
[1:36:40] God led to her daughter being delivered
[1:36:43] of this demon that had plagued
[1:36:45] her why because he is a deliverer by
[1:36:51] Nature Psalms chapter says that the Lord
[1:36:54] will be a refuge for the
[1:36:56] oppressed a place that we can run when
[1:37:00] we're so weighed down that my knees are
[1:37:06] buckling and the mental is worse than
[1:37:09] the
[1:37:10] physical I think about the lepers and
[1:37:12] the and the little woman with the issue
[1:37:14] of blood what they were going through
[1:37:16] physically was horrible but the mental
[1:37:18] aspect of that being completely cast out
[1:37:21] nobody having nothing to do with with
[1:37:23] them they feeling like they were unclean
[1:37:26] completely cast out of
[1:37:29] society yeah I think about little
[1:37:32] Georgie
[1:37:34] Carter what she was going through
[1:37:36] physically was terrible but what that
[1:37:38] girl was going through in her
[1:37:40] mind
[1:37:42] amen a teenage girl who had wasted away
[1:37:46] to 35 lbs I and you did different varies
[1:37:49] but I found a place where he said 35 lbs
[1:37:53] a rubber draw she under to because of
[1:37:56] her kidneys and her bows just to draw it
[1:37:58] out from underneath
[1:37:59] her can you imagine how
[1:38:02] oppressive that must have
[1:38:05] felt 9 years and 8 months in bed unable
[1:38:10] to walk just looking at the walls and
[1:38:13] the only thing that she
[1:38:15] sees is is her condition the only thing
[1:38:18] that she
[1:38:19] feels is hopelessness
[1:38:24] but she had a refuge that she could go
[1:38:26] to a refuge for the oppressed that she
[1:38:30] could run to yes and she began to cry
[1:38:33] out and a prophet of God had a vision of
[1:38:37] a lamb that was called out in the
[1:38:38] wilderness crying out for
[1:38:41] help and when he found her I love the
[1:38:45] story about how her mother saw a shadow
[1:38:48] walking in that day walk as he was going
[1:38:51] in to pray for or to speak the word of
[1:38:53] the Lord poured over her and she saw a
[1:38:55] shadow on the wall it was the shadow of
[1:38:57] Jesus Christ himself as that man was
[1:38:59] walking in Jesus Christ was walking
[1:39:02] before
[1:39:04] him why a daughter of God was oppressed
[1:39:09] in her mind and in her body amen and she
[1:39:12] was crying out for
[1:39:16] help and within a few
[1:39:19] minutes that same girl was sitting at
[1:39:22] the piano playing there is a fountain
[1:39:25] filled with blood drawn from evangels
[1:39:29] veins amen
[1:39:32] why because he is by nature a
[1:39:37] deliverer you can trust in it you can
[1:39:40] rest your soul in
[1:39:44] [Music]
[1:39:47] it I'm winding out I promise
[1:39:51] you he is by nature
[1:39:54] a chain
[1:39:58] breaker we read a story about Jesus one
[1:40:00] time stopped a meeting to go across a
[1:40:03] stormy sea one
[1:40:09] time to a man named Legion now what
[1:40:12] everybody else saw was a maniac yes sir
[1:40:16] demon possessed living in the tombs
[1:40:19] worthless they had no value for this man
[1:40:25] but Jesus I saw a man that was
[1:40:29] hurting a man that no doubt had become
[1:40:32] no stranger to rejection to failure to
[1:40:43] pain and many times failure it just
[1:40:47] leads to
[1:40:48] guilt and guilt leads to shame
[1:40:53] and shame leads to
[1:40:55] isolation and you find yourself cut off
[1:40:58] from the body of Jesus
[1:41:02] Christ and you grow deeper in
[1:41:05] sin all because of
[1:41:13] pain you must allow him to heal your
[1:41:17] pain when you go through it friends
[1:41:19] don't carry that
[1:41:22] around he's talking to somebody
[1:41:24] tonight don't carry that around with you
[1:41:28] give it to God let him take it away let
[1:41:31] him set you free tonight amen you don't
[1:41:35] have to live the the rest of your life
[1:41:39] guilty and ashamed of
[1:41:46] yourself legion's mind was completely
[1:41:50] gone but his soul was crying out for
[1:41:55] help brother Brenham said I see him that
[1:41:57] night crossing the
[1:41:59] sea the waves are roaring and why did
[1:42:02] that man take that chance after after
[1:42:04] sitting teaching all day Healing The
[1:42:06] Sick we find now out in a little ship
[1:42:09] coming across the sea because over in
[1:42:11] another land in gadera one
[1:42:15] Soul was calling for him he left
[1:42:19] hundreds maybe thousands because one man
[1:42:22] who was bound
[1:42:23] who didn't have it the sense as we would
[1:42:26] say in his own mind to cry out for help
[1:42:29] but his soul was crying out I believe
[1:42:31] that was a Son of God that needed to be
[1:42:34] set free
[1:42:38] amen said he come from the side of the
[1:42:41] lake through the storms all night
[1:42:43] long to the next day the storm the great
[1:42:46] tide that night to heal one
[1:42:49] person and I'll say this my brother he'd
[1:42:52] come from Glory this afternoon to set
[1:42:55] any one of you free tonight just let him
[1:42:58] find one sincere heart one person who at
[1:43:02] who desires to be free one person that
[1:43:05] is that is calling out
[1:43:08] amen that's all it
[1:43:10] takes for you to be free tonight thank
[1:43:13] you
[1:43:14] Lord he'll come any time of the day
[1:43:17] anytime at
[1:43:19] night he will speak through you
[1:43:23] or speak to you through a dumb hillbilly
[1:43:26] that's illiterate
[1:43:28] uneducated
[1:43:32] dyslexic most of society would say
[1:43:36] worthless just to talk to you
[1:43:40] tonight if you would stand musicians if
[1:43:43] you would
[1:43:51] come how can relate to this man as I've
[1:43:53] told you
[1:43:56] before a little bit about my
[1:44:00] story as a kid growing up my mom and dad
[1:44:03] were good
[1:44:05] people but they had a both of them had
[1:44:07] mental issues uh my dad had a really bad
[1:44:11] mental breakdown when his dad died
[1:44:13] completely lost his mind
[1:44:15] and uh my mom also um the only person in
[1:44:19] her family that was like it and she was
[1:44:21] like that they say after her dad died
[1:44:22] when she was was just a little girl and
[1:44:25] um my mama crossed a lot of lines um uh
[1:44:29] I went to school a lot of times with
[1:44:31] with my shirt and buttoned up to my neck
[1:44:34] with with bloody welps from neck to
[1:44:35] ankles and um and and uh and busted lips
[1:44:40] and um and don't think bad of her I I
[1:44:44] feel sorry for her she was a good woman
[1:44:46] she honestly tried um but she just uh
[1:44:50] she fought things herself and uh didn't
[1:44:53] have much teaching there was no
[1:44:54] Deliverance in in the church back home
[1:44:56] and um it's very common for us kids uh
[1:45:00] to see demons walking through our house
[1:45:03] um talking to us uh is a regular
[1:45:06] occurrence piano playing by itself
[1:45:09] um as a kid I remember being because of
[1:45:13] things that I saw and the things that I
[1:45:15] went through I remember being just so uh
[1:45:17] shook up I had ulcers really really bad
[1:45:20] I was diagnosed in the second grade I
[1:45:21] believe and the doctor told my mom that
[1:45:23] I would I would probably die of stomach
[1:45:24] cancer before I graduated high school
[1:45:26] and um I I would lay I go to bed at
[1:45:29] night as a kid and I'd put my head under
[1:45:31] the cover and and and I'm trying not to
[1:45:33] say too much but I'm trying to say
[1:45:34] enough so forgive me if I say too much
[1:45:37] um get what I'm trying my point um and
[1:45:40] I'd hold the the covers over my head
[1:45:42] just real
[1:45:43] tight and and I and I'd lay there all
[1:45:45] night long because I I was so afraid of
[1:45:47] what I'd see when I rolled the when I
[1:45:48] pulled the covers
[1:45:49] back and there was a woman from my my
[1:45:52] area
[1:45:53] uh who did things sexually with me and
[1:45:56] my brother from the time I was just a
[1:45:58] child probably four or five years old
[1:46:02] and uh remember as a kid just feeling so
[1:46:04] guilty feeling so dirty and
[1:46:10] uh I hadn't done nothing wrong but
[1:46:13] something had been done to me and and uh
[1:46:16] time goes on and my brother James gets
[1:46:18] killed as I've told you the story and
[1:46:20] and uh I would have these reoccurring
[1:46:22] nightmares so often and is every night
[1:46:25] of my life and from from the age of 15
[1:46:27] to 27 and just reliving that moment and
[1:46:29] trying to save him and and uh it just uh
[1:46:33] it just scarred my spirit so bad and and
[1:46:36] uh I still have them occasionally when
[1:46:38] this flood happened cuz my brother
[1:46:40] drowned really messed with me um I
[1:46:43] wanted so bad to get those people out of
[1:46:45] the water so they get them back to their
[1:46:47] family um cuz I remember how I felt that
[1:46:49] day on the river um knowing my brother's
[1:46:52] out there and I wanted get please get
[1:46:53] him out of the water so that we can have
[1:46:55] him we can bury him and

[1:47:05] them had again
[1:47:07] just mental health issues and my mom
