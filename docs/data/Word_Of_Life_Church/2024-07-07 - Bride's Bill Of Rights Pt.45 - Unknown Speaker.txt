diseases plagues that are so rampant in our day we we pray for our brother and sister Lord that you would lead and guide them give them the wisdom the understanding to know how to raise him no doubt most of us that are adults that are sitting here today our parents had a great impact on our lives either negatively or positively May the presence of God be with them Lord and help them what an awesome responsibility we as parents have an A all of us have made mistakes and for those mistakes we're very sorry but I pray that you would help them Lord that in the light of the evening time they

to preach well you're starting early [Applause] some people get in front of a microphone they just can't take it can let's Stand Together return to the book of Isaiah chapter 54 also while you're turning there I'd like to wish two more special people a happy birthday today that is Ashley and Courtney our oldest granddaughters we love them so much and so thankful to the Lord for them and I'd like to wish Carol a happy 51st wedding anniversary tomorrow and then a happy birthday on Tuesday God bless her between her and my guardian angel I won't even get no reward when I get there I'm all the time getting into precarious and difficult situations and I was in one yesterday and Carol and I was talking about it after the situation and I said when it's all said done whenever I stand before the Lord my guardian angel will get every Speck of reward should been in my name she said yeah right now he's probably saying thank you Jesus thank you Jesus amen certainly appreciate my wonderful beloved wife she's been such a help to me through the years I apologize to her quite frequently not because I've committed adultery on her or anything like that but because of being a preacher all the burden that I brought upon her life and I tell her all the time she could have found men that were definitely a whole lot more handsome don't you'all say Amen to that men that could have probably provided a whole lot better for her but I guarantee you one thing she could have never found another one that would love her any more than I do and I'm so grateful to God for I believe this is our shortest time together we're going to be reunited again on that other side praise the Lord I won't tell you how old she is but she's a same age I am I can tell you how old I'll be 68 wow me and brother JD was telling that before service you just there's no way I have believed I'd ever Liv to be 68 years old there's no way I to believe the Lord would have delayed his coming for this period of years but I know this as long as I've got life and breath I'm going to do everything I can for him and for his people I trust youall feel the same way today God bless you let's read Isaiah 544 fear not for Thou shalt not be ashamed neither be thou confounded for Thou shalt not be put to shame for Thou shalt forget the shame of thy Youth and shall not remember the reproach of thy widowhood anymore for thy maker is thine husband the Lord of hosts is his name and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel the god of the whole Earth shall he be called and remember in reality he's not called that yet this is a prophecy that Isaiah gave of him that he will be called the god of the whole earth that's what we're longing for isn't it for the Lord has called thee as a woman forsaken grieved in spirit and wife of Youth grieved in spirit and a wife of use when thou was refused sayest thy God and he has a need today that you'd like to signify by the uplifting of your hand we'll take it before the Lord Lord Jesus as we stand before your people today I realize it's the greatest honor that a more could have what a great honor it would be to be able to address a king of a country even though we might differ with our president and his politics yet it would be an honor for us to be invited to go before him and talk with him it would be an honor for us to be invited and receive a personal invitation from the governor of Tennessee or some great person and yet Lord God we have an invitation from you and if a president wasn't there and the governor wasn't there to be able to speak to his wife what an honor that would be well sir until I get to see you that day I will continue this honor that's been extended to me for since a young boy you gave me the honor to preach your word to win souls to your kingdom to see people filled with the Holy Ghost to preach to them the evening light I consider it the highest honor of my entire life so once again we've gathered here today Lord and the lot has fallen upon me that I would be given a charge to try to bring something to your people to help them only you know what they all go through all that they face so I'm not here to tickle their ear as it was I'm not here to rebuke them as far as the human part I'm here to say something that would help them if that means correction if that means over an abundance of love and administration from your sovereignty then so be it you see our needs speak to us today Father we love you with all of our hearts in Jesus name amen you may be seated Isaiah is at the Prelude before God is going to divorce Israel by the time Jeremiah begins to prophesy he says where is the writing of thy mother's divorcement so Isaiah is there and there's still a period of Grace to where God is dealing with Israel and offering them that chance by which they can respond to his Grace Grace as we know is unmar favor something that we don't deserve something we could never do to buy it to purchase it any works we could ever do that God would say okay because you done this I'll give you this which is exactly where they were God Likens them to a young woman who had gotten married into a marriage of Shame a marriage of humiliation a marriage that had brought great bondage to her and God stepped in and his mercy and had redeemed her and by now she is already turning her back on him she has worshiped the gods of Moab Kos she has worshiped the gods of the ammonites the amorites the Hittites they brought their children before the idols and they would make these Idols out of bronze and they would leave them Hollow in the middle 9 to 10 foot tall big gigantic arms and they would build a fire inside of this Idol and whenever it got so hot that it would burn your flesh they would bring their children alive and lay them in the arms of that God because they believed it was a god or goddess of fertility so in order for them to have good crops good Vines good trees and their families to be able to bring forth they must sacrifice so they sacrific their children you imagine bringing your child your son your daughter and you're laying it in the arms of this image that the priest would have to hurriedly lay the child on there to keep from getting a burn on their own flesh because these Idols were so hot you say that's a bunch of heathens I'm not sure it's too much more Heathen than what a lot of our parents sacrifice their children to today amen they sacrifice it to rock and roll idols and all types of other Idols come on now don't get quiet on me already they they sacrifice their children to a lot of things that sacrificing has not stopped but I think we as Believers need to realize God has given to us an opportunity not to sacrifice our children to the idolatry of this age you parents say Amen to that because we know that God gives us the challenge but he also gives us the opportunity and the responsibility to bring up our children in the way which is pleasing to the Lord but Israel by this time now it's 700 years or so BC whenever this is written seven he has quite a span there over which he prophesies in Isaiah 7:14 is course 712 Years BC so this is sometime after that so around 700 years or 695 something like that BC and they already gotten worse by the time that God had given ahaz his sign in the Sund dial I'll let you read that historically so you can understand it in Isaiah chapter 7 so they went on a few more years and during that time they've got worse and worse and worse and God would always send the ministry of prophets deeding with Israel in the Old Testament now use judges of course in the dispensation when every man did write that which was right in his own eyes this is before God instituted the office of prophets and began with Samuel once God does and the people desire Kings not God's choice but the People's Choice and when you look at the first choice of King that God gives him and it was a man by the name of Saul a man that was rebellious stubborn hardheaded and you look at the leaders that are leading the nations of the world and you'll catch a pretty good glimpse of the people they are leading is it any Wonder we have such leadership in our nation today it is a reflection of the choice of the majority of the nation so what you see in the White House what you see in the Senate what you see in Congress what you see in the mayor's offices what you see seeing a lot of this and you say boy that's a sorry bunch of politicians but remember we are a democracy we vote them in well come on somebody so what is it these rotten people that we see running our country running our state running our positions of authority who is it that put them in there it is an element of the majority of the people why it suits their taste so their taste for a modern-day leader is a man that will do away with all sense of morality all sense of morality because they don't even know if they're women or men and they don't want people in there that can Divine and say there's only two Sexes they want people that'll say oh there's a whole bunch I mean today you can be a giraffe Kamar you can be a donkey I'm not too far from admitting that a donkey's got more sense than a lot of of our leaders do that's pretty evident I I think a lot of monkeys climbed up in a tree has got a whole lot more sense than the nation's leaders around the world Amen brother dnie at least a monkey but know he's a monkey well come on somebody you don't find no dog acting like he's a cat do you you find a rooster acting like he's a hen come on somebody you find a hen acting like she's a rooster no she got enough sense to know God made her in H shall always be a hen the rooster's got enough sense to know you don't find no rooster pulling his tail feathers out and taking the comb off and acting like he's some kind of dainty fied Little Hen and he's strutting around the hen house you don't find no transgender chickens well come on somebody you ever see a Brahma Bull out in the field and he takes his horns off and he tries to get rid of that pump on his back and he tries to you know act like a little woman as he's coming through them kind that Waits on us at the resturant what can I do for you what can I do for you today and you think bring me a bucket so I can barf oh you talking about making you sick to your stomach brother Donnie we need to love them I love their soul but I hate that homosexual devil that's on them well that's right praise the Lord and you see that's exactly where Israel had got to the spot and God reminded them of what he had done for them yet it had already arrived to the place of course God knew what they were going to do and by now God reminds them again of the state that he found them in I'd like to run a parallel for you and I today that the Lord found us in the same state so he passed by and Ezekiel talks about it many of you you aware of the scripture that it can be read many times and I've seen it myself and people are bleeding and if they have a profuse nose bleed or the a wound that will not stop and it's the the scripture in Ezekiel when he said I passed by thee and I saw thee and thy blood I've seen it over and over again that if people are bleeding and you read that scripture it's amazing that it'll stop and God reminded them of whenever he found them and they were they were not salted and reminds them of their birth and how he said that you were born and their birth was coming out of Egypt and he said you were not salted neither were you Supple now this was an ancient custom when a child was born they would dry the child off and then they would sprinkle salt on the child and rub the afterbirth and all that off of it and God said that you grew up as a young girl and and you were immature and your hair begin to grow and You Begin become a woman and God said when you did what you come to that marriageable age then what happened to you you started flirting with the world and giving the world yourself and the Bible can be quite plain and how it describes such things and God goes on to say that you sat by the wayside and you opened up your legs to every man that would come by now remember this is the way that Israel treated God and God finally got to the place to where he said no more are you my wife now by the time Malachi comes on the earth and he prophesies and he says that God is going to Smite the Earth with a curse unless he sins an Elijah anointing now remember God has different dispensational anointings that he used in different days when God got ready to destroy and bring an end to deluvian destruction upon the Earth there was a special Angel which had power over the waters but remember remember the waters it wasn't just that the waters come down out of the sky but the Bible tells us The Fountains of the deep broke open now we know that there's great they found them many many years ago there's great great containing elements that are in the earth that holds billions and billions of gallons of water and it's the water table as we call it and whenever the spirit of God begin to move upon the Earth and the rain started coming down this way The Fountains of the deep the water table be to open up and gush out of the very heart of the earth now remember God put it there around the core so that it would keep the Earth from exploding because the Earth's Soul come from the Sun so there was a clinker that shot off the Sun and from there come the Earth what is the very core of the Earth and the scientists are saying now that the core of course of the Earth turns in the opposite direction by that it creates a revolutionary something and how it spins so they're saying now that in the last few years that the core of the Earth has actually slowed down and they're really concerned because of what's going on on the earth and I read that and I think yeah it's like the the inhabitants of the earth that their soul also is of a different nature it's going in a different direction and you imagine if it was not for all this water there in the very heart of the earth which goes around the so or the core of the Earth how hot this place would be and The Fountains of the deep begin to break up and there was great gushers that come out of the earth so the rain was coming this way 40 days and 40 nights and as it was coming this way The Fountains of the deep so what was it that which was an invisible force began to pour out in the and deluvian destruction I want you to keep in mind now Demons of hell are pouring in every direction also the prince of the power of the air now remember what Satan is him and his demons his Legions of evil spirits have access to the sphere above us also the sphere beneath us and the prophet said there was three Realms this way and three Realms this way and you and I are caught in the middle every day we're under the influence of those Realms that's why we can have good thoughts bad thoughts that's why we can have good things to happen to us and bad things to happen to us because we're caught right in the middle of these three spheres the anian destruction would never have happened on the scale that it did had not this power had broke up The Fountains of the deep what kept it there well if you go back to Genesis 1 and you read how that in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness covered the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the waters and God said let there be light and we go on and on and on one day of creation which seeks 1,000 years and he he come to a spot then the Bible says the Waters of the heavens were gathered in one place called a firmament now firmament is a gathering together of a mass of bodies that are of a similar genos of a similar kind so there was a firmament in the heaven and then there was a firmament on the earth so there was Waters that was gathered in the heaven what was that water it was what we know as water vapor which will make clouds storms and so on but then there was a great Gathering of the waters and they were gathered where they were were gathered beneath the surface not the visible part of lakes rivers and streams but it's these great massive bodies of water that are in the earth the destruction was coming near and we could tell that it was going to be an Annihilation because what was bouting up out of the Earth is going to Aid in the destruction when God will allow demon spirits and God will allow the people on the Earth to become so oh so immoral and so rotten that they begin to take on demonic looks they will begin to take on demonic traits and characteristics they will begin to imerge themselves into that penetration of the evil in an Unseen World it is a sign another Annihilation is coming now remember when all hell breaks loose all Heaven comes down so it's like they're synchronized together so God has sent little revivals down through the age and by little I don't mean that it's not a great move of God but it would be smaller than say a a destruction which is going to come in a major way so Wars also are parallel with the revivals that God would send upon the Earth it must have been a terrible time in that anti deluvian time that the people of the earth started taking on a remarkable likeness like the Nether world which they had never seen and they began to become more evil and the Bible goes on to say that the imagination of man's heart was continually on evil so every day all they thought was evil and rotness and no good mean and and how they could corrupt this and violence and remember one of the signs of the end time according to the Book of Genesis was violence now look at where we are many of our major cities the violence how it has increased in our day praise the Lord you remember it's not been just a year or two ago to when a lot of our politicians were wanting to abolish our police force you say are are are you are you people in your right mind you want to get rid of the very people who will try to protect us and be able you understand that our police force they're having the hardest time all over our nation to even get people that will come and work for the police force because they think it does no good you go out and arrest the criminals and they're out of they're out under a bond or Bond free quicker than it took them to book them and read them The Veranda rights and they've got to go through all that process and these liberal judges and these liberal bunch of politicians and prosecutors and so on come on now don't get quiet on me don't you see what it is hell is vomiting its influence upon the Earth and then you turn around on the other side and you look at what a miracle that God is doing on the Earth by a people who do not feel at home in this world anymore and then we see people who walk away from the light of the day and we watch how they corrupt and how fast they will corrupt and you know it as well as I do for those of you that's had family members that's been raised in the message or maybe even come to our church and they got away from God and it's like within a month's time with two months time and six months time you don't even know them and I find it amazing because as I've looked at people do that over the years and you watch even their physical countenance that they will begin to take on a different look and sin Demands a great price and if you're a seed of God God will haunt you every day until you come back to your place but at the same time those that are not his he is not haunting him them but it is rather the demons out of hell and remember demons are like the angels of God they're almost helpless without human beings to work through so it must have been a terrible time in this and deluvian destruction that the people on the Earth you imagine people that was living now several hundred years old during this time and they would live that lifetime what a change they've seen so as as I said I'll be 68 years old the things that I've seen in my lifetime are unbelievable now we got people here in their 80s some close to their 90s you imagine what they've seen in their lifetime how that the world has gone down further and further is that true for some of you old people some of you young younger people would you thought You' ever see in your lifespan brother Paul some of the things that you have seen brother Maddy what you've seen in your life and look at where we are you think how is it getting worse it's because the lid has been tore off of hell and them demon powers are streaming in every direction oh he said brother Donnie that scares me you have no reason to be scared unless you don't have the Holy Ghost now if you don't have the Holy Ghost you better be scared stiff because I'm telling you you're not going to be able to make it in this day without the holy ghost coming to this church is not enough saying you believe the message is not enough brother Donnie I respect you that's not enough I respect God's Prophet that's not enough you've got to have a power in you that is greater than these demons out of hell that we are dealing with now remember it's never been quite like this before what we are dealing with and God out of this age is going to present to himself the capping of all the church ages and he would choose the very worst age of all to bring the Capstone he would wait until the very last moments of time until man had got to such a place that he was beyond Redemption our nation is beyond Redemption I don't care who gets in the White House in November I don't care who wins the election we are Beyond Redemption America turned down her chance in 1956 and she's gone downhill ever since we could have a Abraham Lincoln we could have whoever you think was a great politician in every state and it is beyond Redemption let me go ahead and say it the majority of the churches are the same way and God is not calling this denomination that denomination this church that church but God is calling individuals God is calling men women boys and girls who are willing to come under the influence of Heaven itself in order to do this there must be the releasing of a supernatural anointing which will bring the bride to a place of climax Luther did not need it listen to me carefully now Paul in his age now if you'll follow the timeline of the way when Paul gets converted and he starts preaching and Paul would write some of his first letters in Luke of course the author of the book of Acts and he would begin to write some of it and begin to write down some of the sermons that Paul preached and you can here Paul as he starts out that Paul actually believed and thought that the coming of the Lord Jesus would be in his generation but as the time went on you hear Paul and the Revelation began to become more clear to him that he recognized the coming of the Lord was not going to happen in his lifetime and you watch the volumes of these writings how the Holy Spirit began to change how wanted to anoint the people for the present time you see this is what God wants us to be God wants us to be charged for the present but changed for the future charged for the present but changed for the future God don't want us sitting around twiddling our th waiting waiting waiting well the last five minutes before the Rapture I'm going to get on fire with God you'll be of no benefit the years that you're here while you're waiting for that if you have that attitude but God wants us to be charged stay charged full charged praise the Lord uh you brothers that operate battery operated tools or a blower or whatever it is ain't it so aggravating whenever you get ready to blow your yard or this and that and the other whatever you're going to do you you just need to cut one board one one by6 board and you grab your favorite battery powered saw and you pick it up and you pull the trigger and it's As Dead As a hammer well that's the way it is sometimes with Christians they're a DeWalt Christian they're a Makita Christian RI Christian they look like it they're the right color they've got the brand name and you go to pick them up for something you push the button and they just sat there they don't move they don't turn they don't wiggle they don't squirm they don't do nothing but what God wants is fully charged Christians so it's the Lord needs you today this evening tomorrow tomorrow afternoon if the Lord picks you up that he can put his finger on your trigger and you're ready to deliver whatever God wants so he wants us charg for the present but change for the future so that we stay fully charged while we're going toward our great Heavenly home but at the same time we are planning for it living for it I'm going to make plans as if though I'm going to live to be 75 or 80 years old or 90 or whatever but I am going to live every moment of my life as if though it were my last moment cuz it might be is that right now when God goes to dealing with this then you can watch them as they parallel and it's like when Moses begin to write in Genesis 1 and then he put a a span of time a space of time in between the time that the Earth starts being brought into an existence and we can read in Jeremiah as well whenever he looked at the Earth by vision and he saw the Earth that it was in this dark and chaos God would have never made the Earth and left it like that and God would have never left it in such a state of chaos but it's like something happened to the Earth the Primeval State as it's called the Primeval state of the earth and by the time God anoints Moses to be able to write it's like something had already happened catastrophic and it had brought the Earth in this state and it looked like an absolute total chaos and then God begins to move again remember the prophet said when God said you know these seeds let these seeds come and those seeds come even said about let there be light he said the sun and the moon and the stars were already in existence he was not creating them originally they had already been created but remember as God did to the Earth the Earth was your mother so the Earth was the type of you so the Earth was signifying the way you would be brought whenever you were given birth in this life you would be brought out of that dismal dark stage of sin and Chaos that you were in and yet there's something in every human being with a soul they're searching for something they're looking for something they may wound up believing taism they may wind up believing shintu ISM they may wind up being an all types of different religion they may believe in reincarnation they might be a Hindu they might even be a church member whatever denomination that it will be because there's something in them that hungers but God desires to do to us the same thing that he did to the Earth so when he catches Moses up and it's like Moses breaks in on a stage of the creation of God after a great catastrophe or something has happened the pre-adamite world and when something the Earth was in that state and then God allows him to go back and the spirit of God begins to move and he begins to divide the firmament and place the waters here and place the waters beneath the Earth and he gathers the waters now you see this is what God does and God divided the light from the darkness now before it was all this mass of Darkness covered the Earth but what was light the light was gathering the light into a dispensation and separating the dispensation of Darkness from the dispensation of light and the evening and the morning were the first day and then we go to the second day and you found the same thing right on down the evening and the morning I want you to notice the way the Bible writes this that it does not say say and the morning and the evening were the first day but the evening and the morning now if you know the Jewish calendar and the way they keep their time you know that the way they look at it that the new day actually will begin later on in the evening so in the evening that's why the Bible says it and the evening and the morning were the first day so in Sundown Shabbat would begin on Friday afternoon so late Friday afternoon when the Sun goes down that is the evening so the evening signifies the birth of a new day now as westerners the way we look at it we look at the sun coming up in the morning and we say well that's the start of the new day no that's not exactly the start of the new day actually that it starts at that way we look at it westerners it's 12:01 a.m. so you got midnight which is p.m. right and then whenever the clock goes past that till it comes to 12:01 what is it it's a brand new day and yet it is total darkness on the outside so the new day can begin though it looks like it's still a darkened chaos I hope God helps me today to help you to see we have already moved into a new day amen now there's Darkness all around us everywhere there's sin there's debauchery filthiness absolutely unbelievable time that we're living in but we've already moved into 12:01 a.m. so the way we are looking at it it's simply the last stages of the darkness before the sun comes up now what are we looking for we're looking for the Millennium what will the sunrise be the sunrise will be the dawn of the Millennium when the son of David will come and Rain upon the earth now remember God chose three dispensations under the title son son of God Son of Man son of David now Jesus himself identified himself and he referred to himself both ways of course Son of God and son of man so what is Son of God the great spirit God remember God is not a man but God is a spirit so the spirit God gave birth to the part of himself which could become manifested or visible now in that realm the invisible God could never be seen by any of us none of us as a matter of fact God's Prophet said God has never been seen and never will so what will we behold even on the throne of the Millennium what will we behold in the Eighth Day When Jesus our Joseph was set on the throne and then the father will be that light that great shik of Glory around him remember God is not a man God is a spirit so God has to step out of that glory to take on a manifestation to where we able to even know it so then when we look at the destruction God anointed a man by the name of Noah and gave him a message to tell him something is fixing to happen and Noah responded to that message now I realize people saying well what difference does it make if you preach this that the other it don't make no difference oh but it does so what if Noah would have preached Moses message and Noah would have said tell you what we're all going to come out of the land of Egypt and we're going to go up here somewhere in Assyria and we're going to go up a high mountain up there and we're all just going to come out of the land of Egypt and that that that's exactly what we're going to do Noah would have perished with the rest of the earth so with the animals so dispensation it's so important to find the message for the time you're living you understand that's where a lot of the conflict is coming right now and has been for several years around the message dispensation trying to identify what should we be focusing on right now in 2024 what should the message preachers be preaching now let me just tell you this I'm sure you know it already but every preacher is not a man of God come on no more than every Christian is a saint there are many Christians that are not Saints some of the people you work with that you say are good people they may be Christians and saved but it don't mean they're saints Saints come from the Greek word Sanctified and you can have a look at at them they certainly ain't Sanctified so a person could be a Christian and not be Sanctified so a preacher can be a preacher but it doesn't mean he's a man of God he wants to preach he studies to preach and he thinks he's a preach you know some some men are just good salesman and then they confuse it and think they're called to be a preacher they could talk the leg off of his Jack Rabbit they could sell an Eskimo a whole rower of refrigerators and deep freezers why because they've got The Gift of Gab they think it's the gift of the Holy Ghost to call them the preach come on somebody and yet there's many many preachers we of course look at the denomination ranks out here many of them that are not God call men they are preachers but they're not men of God I'm convinced myself in the ranks of the message that there's many in our own ranks that are preachers but they're not necessarily men of God so they will build a kingdom look at their Doctrine Prophet said a man says he's called to be a teacher watch how he interprets the word so if he interprets a word that there's three Gods you know right there God never called that man he's not a man of God God he might be a preacher but he's not a man of God a man of God is those now listen to me a preacher doesn't necessarily have to be a man of God but a man of God will have to be a preacher you see when God calls a man of God he is a man of God before he ever becomes a preacher in that sense he's gifted there God's given to him whenever he was born and yet he will bring forth and capture the light of the day now if he's a messenger of the age God will give it to him and then out from under him will go the ministry of others who have been Faithfully taught and then they will go out and when they get out on their own and they'll have their Evangelistic Ministry their Mission Ministry their pastorial Ministry or whatever they are they will remember how important it is to say only what the messenger is spoken but alas many of them will not then they will get a following and they'll get a agenda and then they'll want a bigger following and a bigger following so they do what do they have to do to compromise to where that it will draw the attention away from the mouthpiece of the age especially if that mouthpiece is gone and then they become the mouthpiece and then everybody's supposed to look at them how many have we had well you see that's not a man of God that's a preacher so we don't want to be I don't want to just be a preacher why better any the rest of you preachers here today any of you preachers you just want to be a preacher don't you want to be a man of God what about you Christians y'all just want to be a Christian or do you want to be a saint oh yeah how many wants to be a saint you see only those according to the Book of Revelation that will walk with him in white because they are worthy we look at it Wednesday night Lord willing they will walk with him in white because they are worthy that's Saints identification Sanctified by his presence Washed by the Regeneration and the water of the word so they are not just saved they're not just Christians but they're Sanctified to him Sanctified him what brother Donnie to be his wife as I've told you before the vows that many of the Jews said some of them still say it this way be thou Sanctified so a man's going to take a wife and they don't will thou take this woman as we westerners do but it's very simple to them and he will say to the woman be thou Sanctified unto me according to the law of Moses and of Israel be thou Sanctified unto me according to the law of Moses and of Israel so what that man is saying is that you will not have any other boyfriends you will not be kissing any other man you will not become the best setting ground for any other man's seed but you will be Sanctified for me and me alone you will be my fellowship alone you see God gave Eve to Adam for what for fellowship and reproduction of his own kind how did the devil mess her up fellowship and reproduction so she started fellowshipping with somebody else that started adding to the word well you know God does know that that you're living in the last age and my if you just stand up there and preach that message in full strength you're going to run people off so I thinking about it before I come to church that's the mentality of some of our preachers in the message is that whenever you go to getting in new people that you stop preaching your sermon so this thought come to me and I just thought it was absolutely awesome so you parents that have had babies come to your family and say you've got a mama and a daddy and you've got a 13-year-old boy 13-y old girl whichever it is and then all of the sudden you have a baby this morning into your family I was wondering how many of you parents then because your baby started sucking a bottle and drinking milk only I was wondering how many of your parents changed the diet of the whole family to match the baby it amen don't you see Satan one of his greatest tricks is to try to start sending supposed interested people into a mature light of the word and then the preacher will start pulling back pulling back pulling back oh I'm just preaching for the babies I'm preaching for the new ones now you apply that same practice right when you get a newborn in your house and then when you all went to the table you've got a new baby in the house so brother Rob and sister way Sister Sarah done you that after your firstborn son come along and then your daughter start coming along and then whenever they was on a bottle brother rob you also had a bottle right and Sister Sarah had a bottle and then the children were used to eating mac and cheese and you know whatever they enjoyed eating so you Chang the diet of the whole family because you've got a newborn well why do preachers do it why do preachers when they see a new face attack two and say oh I've got to cut back I I I can't mention nothing about brother brand you know don't you know I I I I know of preachers that have told people preachers coming to their church now don't don't read no quotes and and don't mention the name of the Prophet you know don't don't don't do that that's a man that's not supposed to be in leadership on because he's treating everybody in the church as if they are a newborn we've got some saints setting here that have been eating mature food for decades then what kind of knead would I be to put everybody on a bottle because we have visitors coming in don't you know what Satan would do he would put visitors here every service if I start complying to that rule but there's one rule I comply to it's the rule of God and the Lord Jesus told Peter don't just feed the Lambs but feed the sheep well come on somebody but you see in order to find the identification of where we are and the emphasis that we put on in the time that we're in so here we are there's two great mergings together in the Earth the prince of the power of darkness and his demons has been released in the political world what we see in amas looks like Hezbollah is fixing to start a war from the north already hundreds and hundreds of missiles that are hitting Israel every day and remember Hezbollah is estimated to have over 150,000 rockets and missiles Hamas is nothing compared to Hezbollah and what is the world doing they're still boycotting Israel on the 4th of July in Philadelphia in New York and major cities of America these Pro Palestinian groups met they burned our US flag and they flew Palestinian flags and they curs America and these are supposedly American citizens don't you see don't you see it's an exact parallel of what Isaiah was dealing with years and years ago that our nation that was supposedly founded on the principles of God but does our nation want God anymore as a whole of course they don't what do they want whatever the people want let them have it brother renom talked about that whenever he was here in the 60s and he said where is our Patrick hris where are those people that will stand for what we are and yet the politicians they will stand for it until it comes election year and then they have to kind of be careful of what they're saying you're looking at the news just like I am you're looking at it on your phone and on YouTube and whatever more and you're reading it and you're watching how they're Kinder be careful you know do we go lean toward the Democrats do we lean toward the Republicans you know everybody's getting kind of worried about Biden I just find it amazing they just found it out you think about what a bunch of nuts we've got in this public they are they are surprised by this are you kidding me where have you been for the last 13 months or 14 months or 3 years where what what planet have you been vacating on it must been Neptune or Mars or Pluto somewhere that you don't realize where we are don't you see how deceptive the people are we've got a man in the White House poor God I feel sorry for them it's no longer funny it's pitiful and yet what have them people done they protected it and hid it and would have done it again they would have done it again because they care more about their politics than they care about this nation they don't love America come on somebody they don't love God they don't love his word I'm afraid friends if we're not careful the same thing is going to hit the message of the hour that people are going to be at the spot they really don't love the message they really don't love what it stands for they love what it can do for them what can the message do for them let me use the message as a springboard that I can get a among the message people go ahead you thief and you'll stand before God and be judged oh my I I don't want to just see what can the message do for me how can I be benefited by being around the message but I want to say what can I do what can I do to bring the word What About It Word of Life we don't want to just say well what can Word of Life do for me how can they benefit me what can I get out of going there reckon I could be this or be that my it ought to be the desire of your heart to say Lord let me do whatever I can do to help a brother or a sister the sick The Afflicted the sad the lonely the weary Lord help me to do something to minister back to the body of Christ oh my listen this the prophet said Jesus was God in flesh and if Jesus is in you tonight it's still God manifest himself in the last days the son of man revealing himself in his church don't let that stagger you the son of man revealing himself in his body body before the Rapture is a Prelude to the son of predition revealing himself in his body in the tribulation period Do you believe the son of predition will be revealed who will it be Satan himself in a human being where did he get that idea he's not the originator of it he's copying god notice let me read it again as still God manifests himself on the last days the son of man revealing himself in his church the human flesh making himself known you get it see God down here at his church making his word the word again the son of man being revealed in the last days isn't this in the UN of God but remember the same life that was in the stalk as in the grain it's just maturing right back he revealed himself what the son of man the grain that went into the ground and his ministry comes from them reformations every man of God is a participant of the ministry of Jesus Christ himself not ever preacher now every man of God you see those who make fun and life and ridicu as a lot of the message so-called believers do they are not making fun of the ministry of Daryl Ward or David Siler or Tim pu or Donnie Reagan or you know some of these brothers here at our church they're actually ridiculing the continuing Ministry of the Lord Jesus himself remember Paul gave us the scripture there in Ephesians and he said he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now Paul is taking this from Paul was a Roman citizen and he saw no doubt many of these parades and it would be when one of these great generals would go in and take a country or take a city that they would capture the leaders the families and the Nobles the nobility of that Kingdom and they would parade them through the streets of Rome and this General would get in his Chariot and they would put the mayor or the governor if it was a king they would either put them beside him in the Chariot or they would put him behind in Chains and then here's the Roman citizens and I stood in that that that way that they brought a Carolina several years ago when we made our first trip to Israel Rome and Egypt and they would come through this aan way and there would be thousands times thousands of people aligned as they would come true and the Roman general would have chests chests of gold and silver and momentos of his image and he would reach down when he would get into strong of the people and as he's going through it pull out a handful of coins and throw it to the people he would reach down and get another so here is the Conqueror and the Conqueror is giving gifts unto the people that are there Paul captures this and he say the mighty conquer conquer death hell on the grave and he led captivity captive into down paradise and he gave gift unto men so the Lord Jesus reaches down in his chest of divinity and what did he do he started throwing gifts Apostles prophets evangelists pastors teachers so you see every man of God with a gift from God is a gift to the people in the dispensation that he lives for their benefit for their correction for their leaders ship so that God can bring them back to where they come from so the when the these people they did not fight they was not on on the front with cica they was not on the front with Pompei they was not on the front and risk their own lives they were making bread and you know fixing their children's breakfast and doing this and that but whenever this great gentle had come through and there might be a little woman there and she's just standing there and she just simply reaches up her hand and catches that coin as it comes into her hand she was a recipient of the Conqueror himself so every church that has gifts cuz it's not just one gift every church that has a pastor has evangelist or teachers and missionaries you understand what happened to you the Lord Jesus you were just standing there and the Lord Jesus passed by your way and through a gift of a pastor and a gift of a teacher and a gift of a missionary and You by the grace of God just reached up and said praise the Lord that's mine thank you Lord Jesus why you never earned it you never deserved it you never fought for it your general fought for it amen now if he gave us this gift do you think we need him now watch again as he goes on to say his ministry comes from them reformations back to the original word again his Ministry listen carefully friends don't miss this his ministry comes from them reformations back to the original word again the word comes to a prophet he promised it in Malachi 4 to restore the faith of the people back to the original grain what one in the ground is here the same what went in the ground is here the same the grain has come up through here it comes up as Son of God so what happened on the day of Pentecost not the son of man the Son of God what is God God is a spirit so the spirit gave birth to a son which could be divided the holy Holy Ghost praise the Lord praise the aren't you grateful for the Holy Ghost today what is that Son of God so you receive your portion of the spirit of God in you and yet Paul received it Peter Luke John well wonder why they wasn't going in a rure wasn't time yet so it's not just time alone there's an an anointing a release of something from the presence of God now watch he says oh my it come up as Son of God now it reveals itself here as son of man then it reveals itself as son of David on the throne see them three sons just exactly oh my like the original countdown we've come into a spiritual age of Astron or not see going above now listen I love the way compounds this together makes it so simple it's the same Spirit only more power Same Spirit only more power so here in a little bit I'll be done and then we'll sing and we've got a baptism and then we'll see how the service goes and then you all will be dismissed y'all will go get in your vehicles and maybe you got your place you're going to eat for lunch and you're going to go home when you look at your gas gauge and you look at think wow I'm almost out of gas I got to St and get some fuel well when you do you pull up to the Gas Pump and there's an Amish guy now you know he's an omous but the way he looks way he's dressed now you're on this side of the gas pump and you're seeing the most strange thing you've ever seen in your life because that Amish guy on the other side of the gas pump has that gas pump stuck in the mouth of his horse and that horse is a kicking and a stomping and a raring up and a belching them gas fumes and I mean it's making him sick as a horse no pun intended and you're standing there looking down and you're thinking what in the world well you see that would be like putting automobile fuel in a Luther buggy Oh Glory so what would it be then if we would pull up and you're fixing to fly wherever and and you you see a NASA truck pull up and here's your boing 737 800 Max and and you're sitting man you're looking out the window because you've got the notification from Delta that your baggage is supposed to oh yeah there it is there it is I see it go on oh my so glad so glad and you're getting ready oh my the tourist is coming soon everybody's getting all ready but you see this NASA truck which has Rocket Fuel and it's coming putting rocket fuel in your 737800 max are you going to continue on that flight so you must have appropriate fuel to match your vehicle now you and I both have heard of people once they started condensing the pumps and they put diesel pumps also right by the gas pumps how many people don't nobody please raise your hand have got that green one so what did they have to do they had to start changing the n housle size on the pump filler and also on your vehicle to hope it discourage some so you fill it up with diesel and you go out to there or it may run for a little bit until that gas gets out of your lines and then you have got major problems you see this is where we must be properly aligned as who we are and what our mode of transportation is and we've got to have the right f Fu or we will not leave the Earth so now let's go the other way around so what if we go down to NASA brother Daryl and sister Ward and sister Jessica was down there here just a few days ago and sent me a a picture they was there as they was launching I believe it was a satellite maybe and and they was there as that thing went off you know that great big rocket and went off into the air so what if brother Dar on them would have been standing there and they would have saw this Amish guy and this Amish guy and he's got written on the side you know whatever his name is and he's got corn and brother Daryl and them standing there looking said Cheryl you ain't going to believe this they're putting corn in that rocket they're putting oats they're putting sweet horse food well you don't have to worry about that rocket crashing because it will not get out of off of the ground well you see that's a problem that I have with us trying to feed the bride of Christ Christ Pentecostalism I'm not talking about a real Pentecostal experience that's not the same thing I'm talking about the same mixture of Pentecostalism that I saw when I was a Pentecostal now I can tell you right now it never elevated me very high off the ground now I did shout I did run and I did jump and I walk the backs of the pews you know but I I want to go higher than the backs of the pews what is that 30 some inches maybe I I need to go a little bit higher in this age anybody with me I need to go more than just my emotions been all fired up and you know that I believe in Emotion I need something that will absolutely revolutionize this 68 year old body in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and Lutheranism will not do it Methodist is will not do it Pentecostalism will not do it there's only one thing that'll do it astronaut fuel praise be to God Amen now here comes the old Amish guy and what does he have one horsepower now the old boy don't need 75 of them going down to there he's not the Budweiser deal so he don't need you know them Big C D but he's got one little old horse that's exactly hooked up to the buggy take him and Ma and the 14 young ones up to the store to trade their goods and come back and smile even there oh they hate you people they don't like you you're so worldly ungodly I've never understood that quite since one of their greatest treasures from us English as they call us is our money and the love of money is the root of all evil so they do all their working and sell all their goods so they can get rich on of our off of our filthy lcer well come on somebody I'm glad for electricity it's really hot in here this morning it'd be a lot worse if we didn't have electricity it'd be a lot worse would it I'm grateful for it but you realize if you would look and see that you'd think that is so absurd I don't understand then why people will look at it in the message and think it's acceptable so we supposedly have an end time word and we have an Endtime vehicle to be able to transport us into another world and yet we're putting oats and rye and molasses and throw in a honey bun every now and then who knows it might even put in a Mater or potato or banana and boy we're just making off concoction ever was and we're putting that inside of our soul thinking somehow that the very same thing that just moves their wheels I'm sure that old Amish guy those menites Hutterites whatever they are they're grateful for that horse I'm I'm sure they are but can you imagine if you are would have hooked up your horse this morning to you about as late as some of y'all get to church you still wouldn't be here by the time I get done y'all be showing up whoa Bessie whoa Bessie I'm afraid some of our message folks are still woing Bessie I'll tell you one thing it's time we unhook Bessie and hook up to the son of man oh I wish somebody would hear me this morning it did not Rapture them it will not Rapture brother Donnie don't you believe in healing I believe in healing I believe in miracles I believe in Emotion I believe in shouting but I believe it must be based upon this evening lifetime word oh my we've come into a spiritual age of astronauts see going above it's the same Spirit only more power yes sir so if we could take the oats and run it through a an analysis and we could take the sweet molasses and run it through an analysis and they'd be able to figure out how many BTUs it would release in the body of old Bessie and how much it would help Bessie to be able to pull that cart behind her no doubt it's a real science and no doubt thank God for the Lutheran thank God for the Weston thank God for the Pentecostal but thank God for the astronauts you see in our astronaut tube I our fuel is so explosive we have signs all over our space tube no smoking allowed no drinking allow no running around allow no adultery come on somebody but you see lucer could drink and smoke his pipe and not fear the danger of blowing up that's well Glory now y'all just have to blame this sermon totally on the Lord cuz this is not the way that I planned on going I'm just on page four and I brought about 40 some pages with me this morning so you know what y'all are been entertained by the great Entertainer himself the Lord God Elohim he wanted to bring you and I into a place of special Conservancy to be able to open up his word to us I hope somebody is listening it's the same Spirit only more power Luther had a portion of the spirit of God but he did not have enough power to bring him into a stage of sanctification now how you saying how in the world can a man sit there and drink beer how in the world can a man sit there and smoke and and a pipe and do all that they done and all that sort of thing all in the work of the Methodist and they'd be able to shout around and still make fun of the gifts of the Spirit of God it was the same Spirit but the power was not released to open more of the word so they danced around glory to God oh my lucier come out said come on Best come on best you went lucer glory to God the shall live by faith y'all be on over and by 14 days I'm coming up there Brothers y'all be with yall Hallelujah glory to God thank you Lord and then John Wesley Struck it and he said Lord have mercy we got more power than what West have what lucier had what was it it was the same Spirit only the revelation of the word release more power amen is it any Wonder to you that they found atomic energy and Oppenheimer the Jew broke into breaking in as well as Einstein and some of those others of breaking a cell what age not Luther's age not Wesley's age remember they had scientists back then too but in what age the astronaut age Hallelujah more power only lifted higher can go higher see more believe more Glory see more believe more be more like Christ see more believe more be more God's calling us Word of Life to see more to believe more to be more oh my nothing automobile nor the horse and buggy not even the airplane but the astronaut he sweeps on and above each one paragraph 60 he's able to achieve talking about the Lord Jesus now he's able to achieve to himself a bride he's going to in the last days be able to get a bride with a Ministry like a man and wife becomes one when Jehovah gets his people like him then he lives in his people they are one it fulfills the scripture exactly St John 1412 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he also do notice I want you to think of how that brother Bram does not stop with this now at just the prophet again in the countdown now is the astronaut age and the astronaut sees things in either the Horse and Rider automobile airplanes again I know you just read that I know I'm reading it again he goes higher the airplane notice the airplane is still down there bouncing around on the clouds glory to God have you noticed how many in the last six months people people have been injured in severe turbulence in the skies in the last six months people that they've had to rush to the hospital planes dropping 15 to 20,000 ft in a matter of seconds I mean that happens if you're in that cabin and you're not buckled up guess what happens to you that plane drops and you are slammed against the ceiling or you're slammed against the baggage area there where you store your carry-ons don't you see what is done what's going on oh is it a surprise to you that years ago when one of our shuttles was sent up and it got up so high and then there all the world saw it as it caught on fire exploded what did they find out was the problem a seal a Rubber seal that allowed the fuel to enter into a chamber and mix where the combustion was taking place and it should not have done but a seal did not hold how many in our astronaut age have we seen seen many Oh Glory to God I got the Holy Ghost Oh Glory to God I got the token and then as they go through trials and they go through tests and they Veer off to the right and they Veer off to the left what's the problem a seal problem they thought they were sealed oh chill didn't hear me this [Music] morning lord god notice he says but he goes beyond the clouds of creeds and denominations and moves on up into the heavens Plum away from everything the astronaut age we living the astronaut age just asur as God has testified by the natural happenings so is he testifying that we've achieved an astronaut God has achieved what he promised to achieve in the last days according to Malachi 4 so in the AST not age God had an astronaut that put his hands behind his head and he started hearing that song I'm lome old so lonesome said would you like to look beyond the curtain of time I think it would help me so much I'm not talking about a near death experience I'm talking about a moving from these four dimensions to the sixth and when he rises up and he looks back and he sees his body he ain't but 20 ft from it and this astronaut landed in the sixth Dimension praise be to God it must have been something John Glenn you know and these guys that went up to the Moon I me what' they find it wasn't cheese what' they find oh they brought some rocks back to Earth and walked around a little bit you know the atmosphere on the earth it on the moon rather it hardly has any atmosphere at all so a footprint that man makes on the moon will lay there for decades because there's nothing there like we have here the winds and all that to change it remember that's you so men have walked all over you men have treated you bad men have done this and that and the other and some of you are still bearing in your memory in your mind in your Spirit the footprints of that preacher or the footprints of this and that and the other come on cuz you are the moon and then God let him had that visitation but he felt funny funny so the astronaut starts feeling funny and he said oh no I don't have to go back said yeah go back and tell him I don't want to go back I don't want to go back Hallelujah some of our astronauts have been caught in the International Space Station and they're not going to be able to return to Earth for a bit because something happened to their vehicle so until they get it fixed they're not going to be able to come back imagine them old boys flying around there doing whatever they do you imagine them looking down third and say I've got a wife down there I got a baby down there and what they want to do they want to come back but notice this astronaut when he went beyond the curtain of time he said oh no I don't have to go back to it do I have to go back Hallelujah so God let him climb back on that astronaut tube as it were and he landed and he got back in his body and then he come to the Tabernacle and start telling them I will never be the same brother brandham that I was let me close God has achieved in this last day according to Malachi 4 the only thing he has to do is get somebody in his hands that can cut loose loose from the airplanes and the Automobiles and what more it'll hold us down every time not look back to what it was but more power to lift him higher lift him into the presence of God lift him up there where all things are possible now we see it's happening let's stand let me read one more stand rest yourself question answer 64 I am not he I am his servant the pillar of fire is not he it's in spirit form see which was upon the son of man and has come now to anoint sons of men to bring back a Ministry just like he said it would be in order for the head notice not a minister but a Ministry I'm the only minister of my Ministry brother brandham was the only minister of his ministry but Jesus has got tens of thousands of ministers in his ministry he he's the only one that could do that so it will bring back now here the pillar of fire you imagine brother random when he meets with the preachers there at the church in the brandom Tabernacle in 1961 and he said Brothers you see what I'm doing I'm putting you all in this with me you all are messengers of the same message now it's really pitiful but hundreds and hundreds of people in this message do not believe that so even when they push play and we hear brother brandom say it they don't believe you you know why they've got a filter put on them so they pull what they hear through them tapes on that man-made filter and then they say of course that brother brandham fulfilled all fivefold of the ministry the only problem is brother Ben didn't say that and the Bible didn't say it so notice this that which was on the son of man has come now to anoint sons of men to bring back a Ministry just exactly like he said it would be in order for the head and the rest of the body to connect I don't blame the devil for fighting the god call Ministry in this message cause without them there be no head Body Connection praise the Lord Jesus I said one more can I have your permission to read one more what if 1+ 1 plus 1 equals one reckon that works for quotes too if Jesus cannot come until a church a body of Believers and the ministry will have to be the same as it was then then that breaks them that them without us is not made perfect as Paul said in Hebrews 11 without us they canot not be perfected they they must have this ministry to raise up the Lutheran the Wesley and all them down through their ages don't you understand Paul needed brother brenham's message Luther needed this message Luther needed it he never even knew what it was but he needed you knew is missing something Wesley needs this message Pentecostals needs this message to bring them out from among the dead praise be to God they must have this ministry to raise up the Luther the Wesley and all them down Through the Ages when that come and that part of of where the Eagles gather just as the carcass the Eagles have gathered so it had to be that Ministry that word so when brother brandom leaves the Earth then what what what's God to do well of course many of these selfish men they say I'm the man I'm the one I'm the one I'm going to take his place I'm not a Moses but I'm a Joshua I'm a Caleb you're a liar it's what you are cuz God's Prophet said the last Latter Day message of the last days was the Joshua and the calebs of those who stayed with him praise the Lord so what does God do God himself comes down on the earth himself don't you understand when people fight this message of brother brandham they're not fighting William brandham it's the ministry of Jesus Christ I'll go ahead and quote it for you reincarnated in his church again in the last days and may I not limit it just to preachers I'll go and quote it for you anyway Harvest time you are the reflection of the last day the message of the hour so it's not just preachers but the Lord Jesus in his body what was the book of Acts the Lord Jesus in his body oh excellent Theophilus I supposed it needful to write unto thee the formal things of the Treatise Luke in the book of Acts he wrote to him and mentioned his name in Luke then he mentions it again of the things when brother BR quotes it he says of the things which Jesus started and continues to do you know who it was that healed these people that come through the prayer line the other night wasn't none of these preachers no it was Jesus right you know who it was that brought them backsliders to the Lord through the prayer line the other night it was the Lord Jesus if you understand it right every God called Pastor that stood up today and preach to his church God's prophet said Jesus still speaks through his pastors but don't let it stop with the preachers Let Jesus flow through the ministry of you how brother Donnie loving forgiving praying reaching out of hand doing what you can to minister to the body praise the Lord let's bow our heads oh my Lord Jesus what have you done today what you have allowed us to participate in in this end time we are so grateful father that we have been made to be partakers of this great message in the last days my God that same Pillar of Fire not in its prophetic form but in the other forms and the prophet tells us an invisible Union it's the same Jesus in Bride form the same Jesus in Bride form they didn't see the bride was hid in you when you were here and they didn't see it was you hid in the bride after Pentecost so the whole thing has been hide and seek hide and seek you hid from Moses but he said show me th Glory you hid but he knew this something so he started seeking your Prophet was told by them denomination leaders that thing that he had on him was an evil spirit so he went up there alone to pray when he was down on his face he heard Footprints he opened up his eyes and the first thing he saw was bare feet of a man which was an angel Olive complexion hadir down to his shoulders with his arms crossed I have been sent from the presence of God to explain to you your peculiar births and Ministry but I have been told by my brothers this is an evil spirit this is why I'm here so what was it hadde and seek so he went to seek and you made yourself known years later when he preaches the trial he says to me it was Luke 17:30 Revelation 10 Malachi 4 it brought a fuel to the bride oh hallelujah oh I know it's been misquoted for decades and people are still misquoting it and they say Rapture in faith lays on the tapes that's not what he even said rapturing Faith lays in you and as the word is being preached it comes through that word your Prophet never even made that statement but people hang their Destiny on such a thing and they think by playing brother brandom that they're getting more rapturing faith every time that they hear it and yet deny things that he said about going to church and if God's in your heart you can't wait till them Church doors are open the people in 1964 when they' got saved and he said now look he said you all find you a church to go to seek out some of these pastors because if you don't have a church you will die spiritually amen Lord God we know the sad thing about it is some people go to church and still die spiritually so we don't want to die spiritually either way we want to be alive Lord amen hallelujah hallelujah and we know before them things take off they put that fuel in just right before they're getting ready to leave and we have had a deposit glory to God but we know the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost amen Hallelujah right before we're fixing to blast off into another dimension the power of God will surge through US Lord and change our bodies thank you Lord Oh Lord May there not be a one of those that sat here today be missing on that day yes Lord father we believe it with all of our hearts help us Lord oh we don't deny the truth of Lucen ISM more than the the truths of Wesley or the truths of Pentecost we just don't want the Creeds that follow it we don't want the ism part Lord that would pull us away from your word we want the power that came with it we want the power of justification the power of sanctification the power of the restoration of gifts mix him with the power of Malachi 4 that'll take us off of this Earth one day in a Rapture oh praise the Lord Jesus we Worship You Lord God thank you Father oh don't you love him today Saints how many he loves him look at me you love him with all your heart don't you appreciate him we're fixing to baptize a little brother he ain't been four years old but he told his mom and daddy they've been been talking to him for a while about being baptized but he told his mom and daddy whenever Brother David preached that service on Sunday that the Lord just dealt with him and it's just time for him to just make everything right with god oh you say brother Donnie it's just a child how can they know what to be baptized I'd say we would be surprised if we knew how young the devil starts aiming at our children I I I couldn't fear our friends before the Lord of a child that keeps you know wanting his mom and daddy to let it be baptized want to be baptized and something happened to that child and me not allow that child to be be baptized but what if they're so young and they need to do it over I've re-baptized a lot of preachers must less Ley oh yeah I baptized a bunch of preachers they didn't want nobody there they just felt they wanted to be baptized it ain't no sin to be Reb baptized this little guy gets 14 or 15 I'm good at it I'll baptize him again if he wants to do it again I'll do it again if he needs to do it again but if the spirit of God is dealing with his heart who can forbid water that's right who can forbid water what if what if one of these days a five or six year old will say mama Jesus was dealing with me and we baptize him nothing great happens all of a sudden mama says to the Daddy what what he he is really changed what if the last seed setting in the church by you and all they've got to do is grow a little bit Carol asked me day she said Donnie how will it be that people that's just coming in all all this stuff that you Brothers have preached for the years won't they have to catch up I said no actually they won't I said a lot of what you've heard and I've heard and all these other people that's been say for decades and decades a lot of that word that we've been hearing and we've heard preach for years and years it's to help us in our everyday journey and brought us from one trial to another to another but God will pick the power points God will pick all the power points brother I'll tell you one thing some of these last ones that come in they'll be nuclear [Applause] fueled wo glory to [Applause] God praise the Lord if I never live to preach you another sermon I love you with all of my heart when we stand before him that day I want to turn around and look and see you all there press be on the automobile press be on the airplane
