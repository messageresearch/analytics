[16:06] fathers Lord God we pray that you would
[16:09] move forever need that you're present
[16:13] dear Jesus if there's anyone here
[16:15] tonight that don't know you may they be
[16:17] able to find you before the service is
[16:19] over there's anyone sick anyone that's
[16:23] weary Lord God you see the direction
[16:25] that I've studied to try to answer these
[16:28] questions questions but if there would
[16:30] be a person here tonight whose need
[16:32] would lay outside of the confines of
[16:35] what I've studied make me sensitive to
[16:38] the Holy Ghost Lord God if it was no
[16:41] more than five or six words for that
[16:43] individual that they would be able to be
[16:45] ministered to or we realize that's why
[16:49] we're here on the earth is to serve you
[16:52] we're here for more than just to make it
[16:53] living and have a vocation and go to
[16:56] school and get this de degree or that
[16:59] degree or make a living for our family
[17:02] cuz one day all of that will be over
[17:05] we're going to come up to your house so
[17:08] really all that we've done for you then
[17:10] is all that will really matter so would
[17:12] you speak to us tonight father from your
[17:14] word we ask in the name of the Lord
[17:17] Jesus amen praise the lord it's
[17:21] privileged for us to be able to be
[17:23] gathered together here again
[17:25] tonight before we uh go into the um
[17:30] questions themselves I'd like to read
[17:32] you a little something from uh proving
[17:35] his word you know as a pastor any any
[17:39] aspect of the ministry you're going to
[17:41] get questions but a pastor is going to
[17:44] get more than likely more than an
[17:47] evangelist would or maybe a teacher
[17:48] would and um whenever a question arises
[17:53] actually that troubles people in your
[17:57] church it's
[17:58] actually my responsibility it's my duty
[18:02] as a pastor to do it so I'd like to
[18:06] share with you um this tonight just to
[18:09] kind of let you see a little bit of the
[18:11] responsibility that falls on your
[18:13] shoulders proving his word the prophet
[18:16] said you know there's a scripture in the
[18:18] Bible in 1 Thessalonians 5:21 where it's
[18:20] written prove all things whole fast of
[18:22] that which is good when anything it is
[18:25] proven it will either be proven right
[18:29] or wrong and when there's anything in
[18:31] question it should be proven until you
[18:35] find out what is right just makes sense
[18:39] right now then as you find out what is
[18:42] right it is said hold fast in other
[18:45] words grip it don't turn it loose hold
[18:48] it fast in other words hold it tight so
[18:53] that it will not slip hold fast to that
[18:56] which is good after it's been proven
[18:58] right and anything that's proven not
[19:02] right then turn it loose as quick as you
[19:05] can get away from it don't ever never
[19:09] hold on to the wrong thing now listen
[19:12] this is what's tricky for all of us it
[19:16] is possible that staunch
[19:19] Christians fine people hold sometimes to
[19:24] the wrong thing thinking it's right but
[19:28] when these things should be proven
[19:29] whether they are right or wrong and it's
[19:31] the duty of all of us and we're
[19:33] expecting to go to heaven when Jesus
[19:35] comes and it's The Minister's Duty when
[19:38] any question is brought up that he
[19:42] solves this out and then proves it
[19:46] before the people that they might
[19:49] understand because no one wants to be
[19:50] found wrong holding to the wrong thing
[19:54] so we have a scripture and Jesus said
[19:55] all scripture must be fulfilled that we
[19:58] should prove all things and then hold
[20:00] fast or hold tight get a death grip on
[20:04] it and don't turn it loose hold fast to
[20:07] that which is good praise the Lord a't
[20:11] that wonderful so that's what we want to
[20:14] do then as a minister of course
[20:15] especially a pastor uh there's going to
[20:17] be all kinds of questions you can be
[20:19] seated thank you um that I'm going to
[20:21] get and and some of them um you know to
[20:24] be honest with you some of them might be
[20:26] a little bit too plain to be able to
[20:28] deal was in public and uh some of them
[20:30] would pertain um to to our church only
[20:35] and let me just say this tonight that
[20:39] answering these questions that they are
[20:42] questions from our church Word of Life
[20:45] Church and so I'm going to deal with
[20:48] them for our church um if you're hearing
[20:51] this tonight streaming it or you're
[20:53] archiving it and your pastor would tell
[20:55] you something different than what I
[20:57] would say tonight well I'll tell you
[20:59] what the prophet said whenever he was
[21:00] here you followed the teachings of your
[21:02] pastor if he's a man of God he's
[21:04] ordained of God to lead you want so God
[21:07] never sent me to straighten everybody
[21:09] else out around the message but God did
[21:11] call me to be a pastor for the time
[21:13] being it's just where I'm at so I want
[21:16] to answer these to the best of my
[21:18] ability but if anybody else hears them
[21:20] and I know they are going to be because
[21:23] they were last Thursday night I never
[21:25] got so many texts from so many preachers
[21:27] and M our life Thursday Friday and
[21:31] Saturday so I know there's going to be a
[21:33] bunch more listening to them tonight but
[21:35] Brothers these questions and answers
[21:37] ain't for you all in the first place
[21:38] they're for my people so if you want to
[21:41] accept them and that's up to you if you
[21:43] don't want to accept them well you know
[21:45] you just do whatever you think is right
[21:47] and if you feel like that we're wrong
[21:49] then you pray for us that we will get
[21:51] right cuz we certainly want to be right
[21:53] don't we use of Word of Life Church so I
[21:57] want to pick up on the question that uh
[22:00] the second one that we dealt with last
[22:02] Thursday night because I didn't totally
[22:04] get done with it when someone speaks in
[22:06] tongues an interpretation is given how
[22:08] are we to know if the person is truly
[22:11] speaking with tongues and how are we to
[22:13] know if a true interpretation is given I
[22:16] don't know who asked this question
[22:17] because some of these questions were
[22:19] given to me by brother Joe and by
[22:21] Brother Rob and they were texting me so
[22:23] I don't know who ask them it's not
[22:25] really relevant anyway but I've had them
[22:27] for this one here was one of the one of
[22:29] the first ones that I got so I've had
[22:30] him for about five or 6 weeks something
[22:32] like that but I think it's pertinent for
[22:35] the hour that we're living in and since
[22:38] I dealt with it on Thursday night I've
[22:40] had a bunch more needless to say and
[22:42] I've I've got some even this very day
[22:44] talked to several not only youth in our
[22:46] church but some older people on the
[22:48] phone today with a brother that's been
[22:49] here with us for many many years former
[22:51] Pentecostal guy and uh so there's an
[22:54] answer there's lots of questions that
[22:55] are being raised up but let's read if
[22:57] you would in 1 Corinthians chap
[23:00] 14:3 now Paul says he that prophesied
[23:03] now remember we know that there was
[23:05] gifts in the Ephesian church and the
[23:06] other churches but the Corinthian Church
[23:09] was the one that seemed to have so many
[23:10] problems with the gifts but in reality
[23:13] if they had not had problems would we
[23:16] had these scriptures Paul never mentions
[23:19] this in the book of Ephesians he never
[23:21] mentions this in Philippians 1 and 2
[23:23] Thessalonians 1 and second Timothy he
[23:26] never mentions this and any other the
[23:28] Epistles other than First Corinthians so
[23:30] actually problems in a church or
[23:33] problems in a move of God will give the
[23:36] ministry a chance to be able to deal
[23:38] with them and help people beyond their
[23:41] own scope does that make sense to you so
[23:44] if the Corinthian Church had not had
[23:46] problems with these gifts then more than
[23:48] likely we we wouldn't even know what the
[23:51] correct answers would be so whenever you
[23:53] look at First Corinthians and then about
[23:54] 5 years later you read Second
[23:56] Corinthians and and you see there was
[23:58] such a Paramount growth in that church a
[24:02] lot of these problems right here were
[24:03] totally resolved but the way they were
[24:06] resolved because a prophet of God was
[24:08] there to give them an understanding well
[24:11] I'm glad he was there because we're
[24:13] still benefiting from his understanding
[24:16] of what gave him then so watch now Paul
[24:18] is dealing with tongues and
[24:20] interpretation and prophecy now they
[24:22] also of course had to deal with women
[24:24] preachers because a lot of the converts
[24:26] in the Corinthian Church they were G
[24:27] Greeks and they were Gentiles and many
[24:30] of them women which were there they were
[24:33] actually part of the idol worship
[24:35] Corinth was a a great Port City and it
[24:38] was a city of tremendous idolatry and
[24:40] most of those Idol worshippers they had
[24:43] actually may strange as it may seem to
[24:45] us but they had women that were
[24:48] Priestess and they actually had sex acts
[24:51] that were brought in to their worship so
[24:54] some of the main leaders in the city of
[24:56] the religious temples of Corinth it was
[24:59] actually women so when them women then
[25:02] become saved filled with the Holy Ghost
[25:04] well they wanted to come right into that
[25:05] New Testament Church and they felt like
[25:08] my goodness they could preach they could
[25:10] just take over the church because that's
[25:12] what they done out there so Paul felt
[25:15] that it was imper pertinent to the
[25:17] church and necessary of course for the
[25:18] church ages to be able to write and give
[25:21] them correction same with tongues
[25:23] interpretation because whenever the
[25:25] spirit of God fell some of them spoke in
[25:27] Tong some of them prophesied but they
[25:29] really didn't know so how do we do it
[25:32] what do we do with tongues and what do
[25:34] we do with interpretation so Paul as he
[25:38] began to write about it no doubt to many
[25:40] of them it was a great mystery listen in
[25:42] verse three but he that prophesied now
[25:46] first in verse one and two he's speaking
[25:48] about people speaking in tongues
[25:50] speaking in tongues of course can be
[25:52] tongues of men and tongues of angels now
[25:55] right here in the service last night
[25:58] there were several people the anointing
[26:00] was moving Among Us and the presence of
[26:02] God was falling among the people and
[26:05] there were several people that I'm told
[26:07] that was under the influence of the
[26:09] spirit of God and they were speaking in
[26:12] tongues and they were worshiping yet the
[26:15] speaking in tongues that they were doing
[26:18] was not to be interpreted it was not for
[26:22] edification to the body so what is a
[26:24] person doing when they're speaking in
[26:26] tongues and they're worshiping
[26:28] and they're just praising the Lord
[26:30] Brother Donnie do you believe in that
[26:31] with all of my heart I believe in it but
[26:34] if they are not speaking in a way that
[26:36] is to be interpreted then they are to
[26:39] speak to themsel and to the Lord and
[26:42] they are being blessed and they're being
[26:44] edified but now if someone speaks real
[26:46] real loud in the service and everybody
[26:49] is quiet and there is no interpreter
[26:51] then Paul said they're not supposed to
[26:54] do that unless there is an interpreter
[26:57] or they can interpret thems now actually
[27:00] speaking in tongues is the least of all
[27:03] the nine spiritual gifts I find that so
[27:05] amazing because it causes most of the
[27:08] problems so it's the least and yet it's
[27:12] one of the most
[27:14] misunderstood but he that prophesies
[27:17] speaketh unto men to edification now a
[27:20] person speaks in tongues and Paul
[27:22] himself said I thank God we really last
[27:24] week I speak in tongues more than you
[27:27] all but we don't have a recorded sermon
[27:30] in the entire Bible where Paul ever
[27:32] interrupted his sermon and spoke in
[27:35] tongues in that sermon so where did he
[27:38] speak in tongues apparently in prayer
[27:41] maybe along with God maybe an
[27:43] intercession we don't know but there's
[27:45] not one recorded sermon in the New
[27:47] Testament where Paul actually
[27:49] interrupted that sermon and Luke or
[27:52] whoever was wrote it down and Paul said
[27:55] whatever it was in a foreign language
[27:57] everybody understand that because Paul
[28:00] talked against that he said that he'd
[28:03] rather speak five words with
[28:05] understanding than 10,000 in another
[28:08] language so Paul said he that prophesies
[28:12] so now let's look at the meaning of the
[28:13] word we hear so much about it these days
[28:16] what does prophesy actually mean now
[28:20] let's forget what we think it means but
[28:23] this is the original Greek language that
[28:26] this was written in so you know the
[28:28] Bible wasn't written in English so we
[28:30] can't always take our English words and
[28:33] say well that's what it means the Bible
[28:35] wasn't written in English the New
[28:37] Testament was written in Greek and
[28:40] Aramaic so notice what the word
[28:42] prophesieth
[28:44] means speak forth by divine inspiration
[28:49] to
[28:50] predict the idea of
[28:54] foretelling
[28:56] future
[28:58] events now this is what Paul said when a
[29:02] man will prophesy which is NOT saying ah
[29:06] the Lord I'm here I'm here to bless I'm
[29:11] here or repeating
[29:15] scriptures that is not
[29:19] prophecy praise the Lord that is not
[29:23] predicting
[29:24] anything oh brother D what if they say
[29:27] the the Lord is coming the prophet said
[29:29] they're not supposed to say that in
[29:33] Prophecy well praise the Lord why
[29:36] because they're not under the true
[29:38] Spirit of Prophecy they're not
[29:40] predicting
[29:42] anything they're quoting
[29:45] scripture now notice Paul said he that
[29:48] prophesies speaketh unto men to
[29:51] edification again I look at the word so
[29:54] it's to predict the idea of of
[29:57] foretelling future events declare a
[30:02] thing which can only be known by divine
[30:08] revelation actually what prophecy is is
[30:13] something that's not even written in the
[30:20] Bible praise the lord well I'll give you
[30:23] the quote for that in a few
[30:24] minutes it's actually something
[30:27] something that God wants to say but it's
[30:30] not written in the Bible why well God
[30:35] knows himself now look at the word what
[30:38] it where it comes from prophecy comes
[30:41] from the same root word of course which
[30:43] is Prophet so who do you figure in the
[30:46] five-fold ministry would understand the
[30:50] most about prophecy a
[30:54] pastor or a prophet look at his title
[30:58] his very title tells you what he's
[31:01] called to do understand prophecy so who
[31:05] would understand more about prophecy a
[31:08] teacher or a prophet an
[31:11] evangelist or a
[31:14] prophet a prophet is one who is sent his
[31:18] Visions is a declaration of things you
[31:23] can't find in the word so this is one of
[31:25] the reasons why that God tells us not to
[31:29] stand up and use vain repetitions and
[31:32] the prophet of God told us that prophecy
[31:34] is not standing up and just quoting
[31:37] scriptures over and over and over again
[31:41] now a preacher can do that that's what a
[31:43] preacher supposed to do but real
[31:45] prophecy is to say something that's not
[31:49] actually written in the
[31:53] Bible Well it really makes you wonder
[31:55] how much so-called prophesying
[31:57] is really coming from the
[31:59] Lord because it ain't matching up as
[32:02] what God's Prophet T now I know I'm
[32:04] weird okay y'all can say Amen to that
[32:06] don't bother me because I've been told
[32:07] that most of my life I'm weird I'm
[32:09] strange I'm really you know kind of a
[32:11] nerd I guess or whatever you want to
[32:12] call me but I'm I'm the kind of message
[32:15] preacher that I just simply believe that
[32:18] brother brandom was sent to restore us
[32:21] back to the original
[32:23] faith I simply believe that if he did
[32:26] not not have the understanding of the
[32:29] nine spiritual gifts we have been
[32:33] following the wrong
[32:36] man we have Wasted Years of our life and
[32:41] we need to repent and recant for saying
[32:46] we've been following the message of the
[32:48] hour because if he didn't understand the
[32:50] gifts he could not point us back to the
[32:54] original Apostolic
[32:56] teaching well I don't know what you
[32:58] believe about that statement I made but
[33:00] I believe that he did restore us back
[33:03] but the problem is tradition and
[33:08] preconceived ideas and it's one of the
[33:10] hardest things you'll ever do is to get
[33:13] some of these message preachers to admit
[33:16] they are wrong believe me I know I deal
[33:19] with them all the time but any man I
[33:22] don't care whether he's a preacher
[33:23] whether he's a teacher whether he's an
[33:24] evangelist whatever he is any man with
[33:27] the Holy Ghost will admit the word is
[33:30] right and he is
[33:32] wrong yes sir you can say a minute don't
[33:34] scare me now watch this so he that
[33:37] prophesies speaking unto men to
[33:40] edification and exhortation and comfort
[33:45] he that speaketh in an unknown tongue
[33:48] edifieth himself but he that prophesieth
[33:53] edifieth the church I would
[33:57] that you all speak with
[34:00] tongues praise the Lord anybody here not
[34:02] agree with that I would that you all
[34:04] speak with
[34:06] tongues but rather that you prophesy for
[34:11] greater is he that prophesy than he that
[34:14] speaketh with tongues except he
[34:18] interpret now can a man or a woman have
[34:21] double gifts yes they could have
[34:24] diversities of tongues or they could
[34:26] have one tongue and they could speak in
[34:29] tongues and they could turn right around
[34:32] and interpret that
[34:34] tongue tongues an
[34:37] interpretation is
[34:40] prophecy now listen to this carefully
[34:43] one person could stand and speak in
[34:45] tongues and another one might stand
[34:48] thereafter and not interpret but
[34:52] actually
[34:53] prophesy now some would sit there and
[34:56] say now wait a minute wait a minute
[34:57] that's per that person seemed like they
[34:59] spoke about 15 words and then that other
[35:02] person seemed like they went went about
[35:04] 25 or or 30 words how can that be well
[35:08] the prophet explains it to us perfectly
[35:10] and God me misunderstood that one is
[35:13] speaking in tongues and the other one is
[35:16] prophesied but if a person is
[35:19] interpreting what another person is
[35:22] saying watch now the word this is the
[35:24] word that Paul used when said that if he
[35:28] speaks in tongues except he interpret
[35:30] look at what the word interpret means to
[35:33] unfold the meaning of what is said
[35:37] explain expound to
[35:41] translate into one's native
[35:46] language so then a person will interpret
[35:50] by explaining and will give this
[35:54] interpretation in their native language
[35:58] now look at verse 23 if therefore the
[36:01] whole church be come together in one
[36:02] place and all speak with tongues and
[36:05] there come in those that are unlearned
[36:08] or unbelievers will they not say that ye
[36:11] are
[36:14] mad but if all prophesy and there come
[36:18] in one that believeth not or unlearned
[36:21] he is convinced of all and is judged of
[36:26] all how
[36:28] so so if he would hear someone speaking
[36:31] in tongues and would all have to say if
[36:33] it was the spirit of God all them it was
[36:35] holy it was righteous it was something
[36:38] Supernatural that God was doing wouldn't
[36:40] it wouldn't it be genuine speaking in
[36:42] tongues have it have to be Supernatural
[36:44] and yet it would not turn a sinner like
[36:48] it would if everybody was
[36:50] prophesying now notice Paul doesn't say
[36:53] that a sinner or the unlearned would
[36:55] actually be convinced or judged by
[36:58] speaking in tongues but he would be
[37:00] convinced and judged by
[37:03] prophecy so would that turn a person to
[37:06] the Lord by a person standing up and
[37:08] quoting scriptures and say behold I'm
[37:11] coming I'm coming my coming is at the
[37:13] door the Rapture is near or I'm coming
[37:15] that's what's going to turn them to
[37:18] God you know why they're going to turn
[37:20] to God the answer is right here on these
[37:23] words listen Paul said one that is
[37:27] believe is not a one that is unlearned
[37:29] he is convinced now notice what prophecy
[37:33] is going to do to these individuals
[37:35] convince means reprove rebuke to convict
[37:40] refute confute generally with a
[37:44] suggestion of Shame of the person
[37:48] convicted by conviction to bring to the
[37:51] light so they're going to hear something
[37:54] in Prophecy that is is actually going to
[37:58] convict them and refute where they are
[38:03] what if a lot of what we're hearing is
[38:05] true
[38:06] prophecy why are not we seeing
[38:10] this now God's Bible does not
[38:13] lie right now notice what Paul then says
[38:17] he's convinced of all he's judged look
[38:20] at this word judge examine discern
[38:25] specifically in a forensic sense of a
[38:29] judge to
[38:31] hold an
[38:34] investigation so you mean prophecy is
[38:37] going to do that to an unbeliever or a
[38:40] sinner it's like a
[38:42] forensic investigation going on of what
[38:47] of this individual's life well how in
[38:49] the world is prophecy doing that if
[38:53] those that are prophesying say I'm
[38:54] coming I'm here I'm here here to bless
[38:57] they're not being judged they're not
[39:00] being
[39:02] examined so how in the world then is
[39:05] prophecy going to judge or examine a
[39:09] person's life and bring them under
[39:12] conviction praise the Lord you see this
[39:15] is the New Testament prophecy not the
[39:18] isua street
[39:20] version Oh My specifically in a forensic
[39:24] sense of a judge to hold an
[39:27] investigation interrogate examine the
[39:30] accused or the witness Now watch how
[39:34] verse 25 just explains that to you thus
[39:37] are the
[39:39] secrets
[39:43] of
[39:45] what so apparently prophecy then is
[39:49] going to say something to people that is
[39:53] going to reveal the
[39:55] secrets of of their
[39:58] hearts so does telling them the Lord's
[40:01] coming do that well if it should they
[40:04] should already be under conviction
[40:07] before the end of the service as much as
[40:08] I say it as much as all the rest of the
[40:12] preachers say it if that that alone will
[40:14] bring them under conviction and it will
[40:16] put them under a forensic investigation
[40:20] then we shouldn't even need tongues and
[40:21] interpretation because the preacher
[40:23] should do it but what is prophecy
[40:27] it's the spirit of God taking gift or
[40:30] gifts in people's lives and telling them
[40:33] you have
[40:35] sinned and it's making it so plain it
[40:38] scares the liver out of you and
[40:41] me while we're sitting there in the
[40:46] service and it puts us under the
[40:49] spotlight of God the prophet will give
[40:52] us some examples of it I don't mind
[40:54] telling you I can see exact EXA L why
[40:56] the devil don't want these real gifts in
[40:59] the
[41:00] church you talking about causing a
[41:03] Revival thus are the secrets of his
[41:06] heart made manifest and so falling down
[41:10] on his
[41:12] face he will worship God and
[41:17] report that God is in
[41:20] you of a
[41:23] truth so just by hearing us
[41:27] quote
[41:29] scriptures just by saying I'm the Lord
[41:32] I'm here I'm here tonight well we know
[41:36] that that a what prophecy does prophecy
[41:39] tells us something that is not written
[41:41] in the
[41:45] word praise the
[41:47] Lord notice this God being misunderstood
[41:50] brother neille when you all want to know
[41:51] now these people that's got these
[41:53] spiritual
[41:54] gifts if you all
[41:56] trust my
[41:59] understanding of the
[42:01] scripture and I hate to say it but the
[42:04] bottom line is there's a lot of folks
[42:06] problem even around this message they do
[42:09] not trust brother brenham's
[42:11] understanding of the scripture they
[42:14] trust their own
[42:16] better I will come down to the meeting
[42:19] and just with you alone that has gifts
[42:22] so we can set together and watch brother
[42:24] Neville and the church that is God God
[42:26] moving among them and that's what we
[42:29] want but we want to put that in order
[42:32] now listen it's amazing to me when you
[42:35] go to reading these quotes that some of
[42:37] the ones that push the gift so much
[42:40] they'll tighten up on you like a TT like
[42:43] a tick on a fat dog they'll just pull
[42:46] their shoes in oh my oh no oh no we're
[42:49] going to put it in order we're going to
[42:50] kill it say what he said if the word of
[42:53] God kills any gift it needs to be
[42:58] killed we want to put it in order
[43:04] so it can be a blessing to the
[43:07] church and do
[43:11] something now God I know I know the
[43:15] scriptures what to do and that's what we
[43:19] want to do you can imagine any preacher
[43:22] with the
[43:23] boldness to stand and go in the opposite
[43:25] direction re that when God's Prophet
[43:27] said he knew the scriptures and knew
[43:29] what to do and preachers in the M oh
[43:31] well we don't need that that ain't the
[43:32] way we do it at our church well that's
[43:34] the way we're going to do it at ours I
[43:37] want them myself anybody else here want
[43:39] them oh I want everything God's got for
[43:42] us but I do not want a Pentecostal
[43:46] impersonation I want a
[43:49] genuine notice he said so we're grateful
[43:52] now notice how brother brandham looked
[43:55] Gabriel's instruction of Daniel at
[43:57] Tong's interpretation and prophecy how
[43:59] it was going to help him in his
[44:02] prophetic office what a relief it is for
[44:05] me at home when I come home then that
[44:07] discernment on the prophetic side just
[44:09] tears me down and therefore God has sent
[44:13] me some
[44:15] relief relief for that through prophecy
[44:20] and speaking in tongues and
[44:23] interpretation which is prophecy
[44:27] and one time saying it apparently wasn't
[44:28] enough you want to say it again which is
[44:32] prophecy so you mean brother brandham
[44:34] looked to real tongues real
[44:37] interpretation as being equivalent to a
[44:41] prophetic gift of
[44:45] discernment as I've been looking at this
[44:47] I thought Lord thank you so much God
[44:49] knew that in every Church age there
[44:52] wouldn't actually even be a prophet God
[44:53] knew in every Church there wouldn't be
[44:56] be a prophet that would be able to have
[44:58] discernment but God said I'll tell you
[45:00] what I'll do I'll put some gifts in
[45:02] there then even when they're ain't a
[45:04] prophet them gifts will do the same
[45:08] thing them gifts will do the same thing
[45:11] oh you mean brother Donnie similar in
[45:13] the way it was like brother brandham
[45:15] this is the prophet himself saying this
[45:19] God has sent me some relief from that
[45:21] through prophecy and speaking in tongues
[45:23] and interpretation which is prophy Y
[45:26] which is prophecy now I find it amazing
[45:29] you know the lot Brothers they want to
[45:31] say well actually you know brother
[45:33] brandom did not preach that stuff out on
[45:36] the field brother bandam only taught
[45:38] that at his church so really it's not
[45:40] for message churches it's just for
[45:43] brandom Tabernacle only I just wish
[45:45] those brothers would have studied a
[45:46] little bit more and paid attention to
[45:49] the towns where brother brandham was
[45:52] when he was correcting you see he was
[45:54] not only here to preach a bride Revival
[45:58] he was a leoty and church AIDS messenger
[46:01] so he come to correct their
[46:06] errors now you know what I find amazing
[46:09] is I'm going to read you a quote here in
[46:10] a few minutes it goes back for
[46:14] 66
[46:17] years and he was correcting things 66
[46:21] years ago in the Pentecostal churches
[46:25] that we're having to correct and message
[46:28] churches I hope and pray to God that
[46:31] we've not gone
[46:33] backwards
[46:35] 66
[46:38] years shouldn't we be further up the
[46:41] road friends than that you mean we're
[46:43] just now we we are just now back to what
[46:46] Leo DEA Pentecost
[46:52] was oh my look at this in s Caton which
[46:57] is saskatch in Canada 1957 speaking in
[47:00] tongues interpretation of tongues not a
[47:03] bunch of wild fire but genuine Holy
[47:05] Spirit Revelations coming tells things
[47:09] that happens right then not something
[47:12] that says Jesus is coming we believe
[47:17] that it's wrote In the book God don't
[47:20] use vain
[47:21] repetitions and he asked us not to do
[47:24] the same thing but it's something
[47:27] definite for somebody in the church for
[47:31] a purpose again he says when you go into
[47:33] a meeting the first thing you do you get
[47:35] up there and have a bunch of tongues and
[47:37] interpretation and somebody raise up and
[47:40] keep quoting the
[47:44] scripture what' he say it was
[47:50] carnal you me brother brandham said that
[47:53] when people speak in tongues and
[47:54] interpret and quoting scripture the
[47:57] prophet of God identified that as
[48:00] carnal but yet a lot of us are calling
[48:02] it so spiritual oh it was so spiritual
[48:08] really well it's for me in my house we
[48:12] following
[48:14] this Pentecost never produced a
[48:17] Rapture and it never will it takes the
[48:20] message of Malachi
[48:22] 4 now watch somebody raise up and keep
[48:25] qu in the scripture and that's carnal
[48:27] absolutely he says God said for us not
[48:30] to use vain repetitions what about
[48:34] him you see this is why he told us that
[48:37] don't use vain repetition because what
[48:39] you've got God doing is the thing he
[48:42] told us not to do
[48:45] himself so what if all the
[48:48] prophets after
[48:50] Moses Moses stood up and prophesied and
[48:53] God was the first prophesier in the the
[48:55] Book of Genesis chapter 3 and then Moses
[48:58] began to prophesy of course in the first
[49:00] five books of the Bible and then every
[49:03] other Prophet thereafter for thousands
[49:06] of years would stand up and
[49:09] say the same prophecies that Moses
[49:13] did I the Lord
[49:15] God I the Lord God will raise up a
[49:18] prophet like an unto
[49:20] me I will raise him from among your
[49:22] brethren and this is the way you'll know
[49:25] him
[49:26] so we'll say that was
[49:28] Joshua then here come another prophet
[49:32] Micah Zachariah Malachi oedi Jonah
[49:38] Nehemiah all these different ones of the
[49:40] Old Testament and they all stood up and
[49:43] said Hallelujah the whole hour the Lord
[49:45] God will raise up a prophet Laing unto
[49:48] me we didn't need a prophecy saying
[49:52] that that was written in the Torah
[49:56] in the law but what did God do if Isaiah
[50:00] would have said that we would have never
[50:02] had a prophecy about Behold a virgin
[50:06] shall
[50:07] conceive and bring forth a son that was
[50:10] not written in Moses
[50:13] writings Zachariah could have never said
[50:17] behold the man whose name is the
[50:21] branch he shall come Isaiah could have
[50:24] never prophesied
[50:25] Hallelujah I feel like shouting a little
[50:28] bit now he could have never prophesied
[50:30] and said the lame man shall leap Us in
[50:32] heart why not just say what Moses said
[50:36] and just quote the scripture then naam
[50:39] would have never said that one day it
[50:42] would come to pass that the Chariots
[50:44] would jostle on the streets and the
[50:47] prophet said he looked at Chicago and
[50:49] saw Chicago and the Outer Drive around
[50:52] Chicago he didn't know what to call them
[50:55] he didn't didn't know that there was
[50:56] SUVs and cars and Cadillacs and trucks
[50:58] all he knew to call a moving vehicle in
[51:01] that day was a chariot so you imagine my
[51:03] vision he looks there and he says I see
[51:05] it I see it ha got 2:7 whenever he said
[51:09] the desire of All Nation shall come that
[51:12] was not written in the word that's true
[51:19] prophecy oh my notice brother R goes on
[51:22] to say tongues and interpretation it's
[51:24] right but it's to be a direct message to
[51:28] the church and to somebody not just
[51:32] carnal and things like that now that was
[51:36] at the Tabernacle Southern Pines North
[51:39] Carolina a BN a I mean a whole bunch of
[51:44] Pentecostal people
[51:47] 1958
[51:48] 66 years
[51:50] ago and then those discerners with the
[51:53] spirit of discernment
[51:56] thus sayeth the Lord now here the
[51:58] prophet is relating to these group of
[52:00] people how it was in his church at
[52:04] home so they would have people that
[52:07] spoke in tongues people that interpreted
[52:08] or people that prophesy and they would
[52:11] meet before church and they would pray
[52:14] and wait and pray and wait and if
[52:17] tongues came an interpreter they had at
[52:19] least three people sitting there with
[52:21] the spirit of discernment on them and
[52:24] they would hear the people speak in
[52:26] tongues and interpret or prophesy then
[52:29] the discerners would pray Lord was this
[52:32] you was this
[52:34] you and it had to be at least two out of
[52:37] the three that would say that's the Lord
[52:41] that's the
[52:42] Lord then they would write that down
[52:45] they'd lay it down up here on the
[52:47] pulpit and that prophecy was read that
[52:50] night now watch notice how brother Bram
[52:54] gives us examples of what went on in his
[52:56] church look friends I'm not talking
[52:59] about prophecies that were made out
[53:01] amongst the
[53:04] Pentecostals brother random was in New
[53:06] York in 1963 it was service after
[53:09] service Pentecostal jumped up
[53:12] interrupted his service prophesying
[53:15] speaking in tongues brother Brandon was
[53:18] courteous brother brandom would stop he
[53:20] would pause it would seem as if though
[53:23] he went along with every of it until you
[53:27] go home 1226 63 about a month later and
[53:32] whenever he's speaking to his home bride
[53:36] people and then he tells them if there's
[53:38] ever been a thorn in my
[53:43] side and then he goes to talking about
[53:45] that meeting he just come from in New
[53:48] York y'all had never heard that before
[53:51] yeah that's what he done so he calls
[53:53] that a thorn in his side what was it
[53:57] speaking in tongues interpretation soal
[53:59] prophecy soall he was courteous he was
[54:02] nice he would make way for it and let it
[54:04] happen but boy when he went back home I
[54:07] mean Katie bar the door here we come why
[54:11] he's out there trying to reach the
[54:13] Pentecostals but most of them would not
[54:16] be corrected may God have mercy on us
[54:19] that we don't take on that same
[54:22] Spirit now notice the example that he's
[54:25] giving whenever he's relating to how it
[54:28] went on in his church thus sayith the
[54:30] Lord tonight there'll be a woman come in
[54:32] from a certain place she'll have a green
[54:34] scarf over her head she'll be brought in
[54:38] she's from Ohio now remember this is not
[54:41] discernment from Brother brandom these
[54:43] were the gifted people that met in the
[54:45] room before
[54:50] church to have brother random to lay
[54:52] hands on her but first before doing that
[54:55] tell him to tell
[54:58] her now here these discerners and
[55:00] interpreters and all that they're
[55:01] writing this out and they're giving this
[55:03] and said tell brother brandom to tell
[55:06] this woman that when she was a treasur
[55:09] in a certain Church she stole money
[55:12] that's the reason she's paralyzed make
[55:14] that right and God will heal her a
[55:17] discerner raised up and said it was of
[55:20] God the other one said it was of God
[55:23] they put that message down when it come
[55:25] to the platform a little buzzer ranging
[55:27] from my study I walked out here are
[55:29] these prophecies was I give it to the
[55:32] people right the way it was wrote there
[55:34] with a man with the discernment right no
[55:37] slip UPS there they was here's brother
[55:41] Bram amongst and Pentecostals 66 years
[55:45] ago trying to straighten out tongues
[55:48] interpretation and
[55:51] prophecy Lord have mercy on us now what
[55:55] how he gives this scenario then that
[55:58] night there come a woman in she's in a
[56:02] wheelchair or a CAU whatever it was
[56:04] she's brought up got on a green scarf
[56:08] all the congregation's looking for now
[56:10] can you imagine if this happen at our
[56:11] church on
[56:14] Sunday and it's written down laying up
[56:16] here brother Lou whoever the song litter
[56:18] is either they do it or I do it and I
[56:20] walk out there we have a thus sayeth the
[56:22] Lord this morning T and interpretation
[56:26] came and the discerner said it was of
[56:28] the Lord there's supposed to be a man in
[56:31] this assembly this morning he got one
[56:33] leg shorter than the other one according
[56:36] to the prophecy that was
[56:38] given that man did something wrong he'll
[56:41] have on a certain tith he'll did a
[56:43] certain thing that man is here today if
[56:46] he'll repent God will heal him and make
[56:49] him well that man walks out of the back
[56:52] up there and said dear God have mercy
[56:54] that's me
[56:55] that's
[56:57] me but does that happen when we speak in
[57:00] tongues and interpret and simply quote
[57:08] scriptures but if we
[57:11] prophesy and reveal the
[57:14] secrets of the
[57:17] heart oh my
[57:19] goodness help us Lord Jesus
[57:23] sir
[57:25] there she was and I would say lady you
[57:28] stole that money out of the treasury
[57:30] when you was that's right that's right
[57:31] brother brandom that's right God forgive
[57:33] me I'll make it right stand up on your
[57:35] feet Jesus Christ makes you well there
[57:37] it was brother Jones move away tomorrow
[57:40] at 2:00 it's going to happen all right
[57:43] he moves away it happens fine we thank
[57:45] the Lord if it don't happen there's an
[57:48] evil spirit among
[57:50] them they don't get no more till they
[57:52] pray that thing away you don't want that
[57:54] Spirit on you you don't want no Folly
[57:57] you don't want no hoax you want the real
[58:00] holy ghost or don't pass any at all
[58:03] that's the way I
[58:04] feel put your church in that kind of an
[58:08] order listen to
[58:10] this and watch what
[58:13] Pentecost Rises
[58:17] to and we're absolutely scared to death
[58:22] that if we put it in prophetic order
[58:25] it'll kill
[58:27] it then we don't believe what he
[58:30] said he never said it would kill it it
[58:32] was not his desire to kill it why would
[58:35] a godsent prophet want to kill godsent
[58:43] gifts put your church in that kind of
[58:45] order and watch what Pentecost Rises to
[58:48] I differ with brother brandom well let's
[58:50] see if you differ with this that's the
[58:52] way Paul had it done
[58:56] that's the way it's
[58:58] done in the
[59:01] scripture you never find one example in
[59:05] history or in the church you know it
[59:07] bring it to me where they stood up thus
[59:10] say the Lord I'm here I'm coming I'm
[59:12] doing this and that and the other look
[59:14] at agabus in the New Testament took up a
[59:17] piece of Paul's garment and he come and
[59:19] bound his hands any know who Paul was
[59:22] thus sayith the Lord the man whose
[59:24] garment is is he's going to Jerusalem
[59:26] and he will be bound there same one
[59:28] prophesied about a dir which was a
[59:31] famine that was coming they did not do
[59:33] that in the Apostolic Church where does
[59:36] this come from isusa
[59:39] street isusa
[59:43] street and it tries to hide under the
[59:46] name of original
[59:49] Pentecost but devil let me make it known
[59:52] to you tonight old boy we've got got
[59:54] your number and this word is going to
[59:57] expose Your
[1:00:00] Hide you can't hide from the allseeing
[1:00:03] eye of Jesus
[1:00:05] devil praise the Lord now notice he said
[1:00:09] that's the way it was done in the
[1:00:10] scripture it's not just while somebody's
[1:00:12] speaking one raised up speak in tongues
[1:00:14] go make an alter call another speaks in
[1:00:16] tongues no interpretation no wonder it's
[1:00:20] Babylon my you've got something real I
[1:00:24] want you listen this friends out the
[1:00:26] outside world is hungering for
[1:00:30] it but not the way you're giving it to
[1:00:37] them they're hungering for it but not
[1:00:39] the way you're giving it to them that's
[1:00:41] right they
[1:00:43] long to find
[1:00:47] God neither do we want to go to the
[1:00:49] other side oh we don't believe in them
[1:00:51] old tongues that ain't nothing but a
[1:00:52] Pentecost brother Donnie he's always
[1:00:55] been that way he believes that I'll tell
[1:00:57] you why I believe it because it's in the
[1:00:59] Bible and it's in the message of the
[1:01:01] hour and it's each one of you young
[1:01:04] people's rights as Sons and Daughters of
[1:01:06] God to have the baptism of the Holy
[1:01:09] Ghost in your soul well all of you speak
[1:01:11] in tongues more than likely you won't
[1:01:13] but if God wants you to then you should
[1:01:15] give him your mouth so he can do that
[1:01:17] through you if God wants to prophesy
[1:01:19] through you so be it did not the Bible
[1:01:22] tell us again by prophecy when Peter
[1:01:24] stood up on the day of Pentecost and
[1:01:26] said these are not drunk as youo as you
[1:01:29] suppose they are but this is that which
[1:01:32] was spoken what's he quoting prophecy
[1:01:35] but he wasn't standing quoting ah the
[1:01:36] Lord's coming I'm fixing to do this and
[1:01:38] I'm fixing to do that he was quoting a
[1:01:41] scripture that pertained to their day
[1:01:44] and Peter could say this day this
[1:01:47] scripture is
[1:01:48] fulfilled prophecy oh my I I hope and
[1:01:52] pray to God the bride of Christ Christ
[1:01:54] around the world and every nation gets
[1:01:58] so sincere with God and gets such a
[1:02:00] desire to have the spirit of God move
[1:02:02] Among Us that the phenomenal and the
[1:02:05] supernatural will be in every day of our
[1:02:08] life every service we have oh praise God
[1:02:11] what a time it would be to see God
[1:02:15] moving
[1:02:17] hallelujah praise the Lord talking to a
[1:02:20] brother today on the phone when I had
[1:02:23] the Saints last night lay their hands on

[1:02:26] to have to leave cuz he had a such a
[1:02:28] terrible headache and the Saints around

[1:03:11] hallelujah oh
[1:03:13] my thank you
[1:03:16] Jesus I'm sorry no I
[1:03:19] ain't watch this again in Tucson Tucson
[1:03:24] not Jeffersonville
[1:03:27] Tucson Gifts of tongues interpretation
[1:03:29] in tongues now that is just in repeating
[1:03:32] or something make a vain repetition it's
[1:03:35] saying something directly to be
[1:03:36] interpreted for a certain person in the
[1:03:39] congregation or something to make way
[1:03:42] tongues by interpretation is prophecy
[1:03:47] and it's prophetic utterance given to
[1:03:50] the people to tell them what to do or
[1:03:53] something to correct them oh if the
[1:03:56] great Church of the Living God could
[1:03:59] only be set in
[1:04:03] order praise God Grass Valley
[1:04:08] California see the Bible says as
[1:04:10] speakable tongues is edifying yourself
[1:04:12] unless there be an interpretation if the
[1:04:15] interpretation that's prophecy to the
[1:04:19] church Jeffersonville when anyone speak
[1:04:21] with tongues it must must be something
[1:04:23] to the church and it must happen too we
[1:04:26] if not have been evil spirit it must
[1:04:28] come to pass because interpretation of
[1:04:30] tongues is prophecy we know that's right
[1:04:35] so we try to live the Bible just the way
[1:04:38] it's
[1:04:39] taught Church order which a lot of
[1:04:43] preachers don't like I love it now we
[1:04:46] all know that the Lord is coming we're
[1:04:48] aware of that and if Neville brother
[1:04:50] Neville got up each night and said
[1:04:53] behold the Lord is coming behold the
[1:04:55] Lord is coming that would be all right
[1:04:57] but he's saying that the pastor at the
[1:04:59] platform he's got the word for that now
[1:05:03] watch him on down as he comes down in
[1:05:05] this quote a little farther tongues
[1:05:07] interpretation of tongues which is
[1:05:09] prophecy or a prophet
[1:05:12] speaking that's something that's not
[1:05:15] written in the
[1:05:20] word don't you understand why some folks
[1:05:22] feel safe
[1:05:25] and they're
[1:05:26] prophesying by just quoting
[1:05:31] scripture it don't put them under
[1:05:34] pressure the Sunday morning a man will
[1:05:36] come in or a woman will come in dressed
[1:05:38] in a certain thing there ain't no
[1:05:40] pressure by just standing up quoting
[1:05:45] scripture do we want the
[1:05:47] real or do we want a dime store
[1:05:52] copy praise the Lord is that what y'all
[1:05:54] want y'all want a diamonda you want a
[1:05:56] diamonda copy no brother Paul is that
[1:05:58] what you want what about the rest you
[1:06:00] Sisters You Brothers you want a real you
[1:06:03] want a dime store copy that just just
[1:06:05] acts like don't you understand why Satan
[1:06:08] does that to us he scared to death of
[1:06:10] the real and if he can bring something
[1:06:13] up that just don't quite line
[1:06:17] up and people will see a failure and you
[1:06:20] mark her down you will see
[1:06:23] failures
[1:06:25] and there will be more and more if
[1:06:28] people don't line up by the prophecy why
[1:06:31] i't trying to scare you no no no no you
[1:06:33] do whatever you want to do I'm only
[1:06:35] telling you what the message tells
[1:06:37] us
[1:06:39] mama notice this behold the Lord is
[1:06:42] coming the Lord is coming but he said
[1:06:44] he's saying that the pastor at the
[1:06:46] platform he's got that the word for
[1:06:48] tongues interpretation of tongues which
[1:06:49] is prophecy or a prophet speaking that's
[1:06:53] something that's not written in the word
[1:06:56] what's written in the word he's to bring
[1:06:58] it that's what his preachers are
[1:07:00] supposed to bring of course but what's
[1:07:01] not written in the word you're to tell
[1:07:08] him so if it's genuine prophecy then it
[1:07:12] can tell me brother Donnie when you get
[1:07:14] up
[1:07:15] Sunday You Preach for so long and you'll
[1:07:18] watch this certain person come in and
[1:07:20] you watch them they're going to be saved
[1:07:22] you can tell me
[1:07:27] if it's true
[1:07:30] prophecy praise the Lord like for
[1:07:33] instance tell brother
[1:07:36] wheeler thus sayith the Lord tomorrow in
[1:07:39] his sand pit not to go down to it
[1:07:43] because there'll be a truck turnover or
[1:07:45] something like that it's got to be done
[1:07:47] now you spoke it he's interpreted then
[1:07:50] lay it on the platform after your
[1:07:51] ministry is finished not after to the
[1:07:54] church the hymn start singing and so
[1:07:56] forth your ministry is finished then let
[1:07:59] them come forth with what prophecy has
[1:08:01] been given wow man that's kind of plain
[1:08:05] ain't it tell brother Jared to be
[1:08:08] careful tomorrow because he's going to
[1:08:10] borrow his daddy's truck and whenever he
[1:08:13] does there's going to be a certain
[1:08:15] something or another in the road and
[1:08:16] whenever he does somebody lock lost an
[1:08:18] axle out of their car and is going to go
[1:08:20] up the whole side of his truck and his
[1:08:22] daddy's literally going to kill him so
[1:08:24] tell him do not borrow that truck
[1:08:26] tomorrow but instead most of ours are so
[1:08:35] vague praise the
[1:08:37] Lord praise the
[1:08:39] Lord question answer 64 now I believe in
[1:08:42] speaking in tongues I believe in
[1:08:44] interpretation but it
[1:08:47] must say it with me
[1:08:51] must be something directly to to the
[1:08:54] church
[1:08:57] not the Lord is coming soon or something
[1:09:01] which is all right but don't use vain
[1:09:03] repetitions Jesus said as a heathens do
[1:09:07] it must be something go tell brother so
[1:09:09] and so a certain thing that he done why
[1:09:11] go tell brother and sister so and so
[1:09:13] when they did a certain thing the other
[1:09:14] day she transgressed the law of her
[1:09:17] husband's AOW to her husband unless she
[1:09:19] makes this thing right the holy spirit
[1:09:22] will cut her off
[1:09:25] wow don't you understand what tongues
[1:09:27] and interpretation really is it brings
[1:09:31] the peretic gift and puts it in every
[1:09:34] local
[1:09:36] body I wonder how many of us would pray
[1:09:38] a little more if that started happening
[1:09:41] Among Us I wonder how many of us would
[1:09:43] come in here with a different attitude
[1:09:44] to church well I'll tell you one thing I
[1:09:47] I didn't like it because Brother Louie
[1:09:48] didn't leave the singer last night I've
[1:09:49] just got a real attitude I'll tell you I
[1:09:51] just don't I don't understand why it
[1:09:52] went that way it was three deg too cool
[1:09:55] for me in church tonight I couldn't get
[1:09:56] in for nothing in this world wouldn't
[1:09:58] you hate for God to prophesy to somebody
[1:10:00] and say brother Jonathan you had an
[1:10:02] attitude there Wednesday night boy don't
[1:10:04] do that again God's going to cut you off
[1:10:05] son you come to the house of God to
[1:10:08] worship you come to praise him you come
[1:10:10] oh brother Ram said people ain't
[1:10:11] worshippers that's the problem well it's
[1:10:13] too hot it's too cold there's trouble in
[1:10:16] the church this ain't going on he said
[1:10:18] you ain't no worshipper a worshipper
[1:10:20] comes to worship God if everything is
[1:10:22] going wrong if it's cold if it's hot oh
[1:10:25] my if there's trouble in the church a
[1:10:27] worshipper comes to worship God if
[1:10:29] they're the only one doing it if there's
[1:10:31] 500 sitting there and there's dead as a
[1:10:33] mouse they're going they ain't moving
[1:10:35] that worshipper that worshipper is there
[1:10:37] to praise
[1:10:39] God oh my God we that's what we want to
[1:10:42] do notice then you've got th thus say
[1:10:45] the Lord then bring sin
[1:10:49] in that's when you got a church like it
[1:10:52] was with
[1:10:55] Anan and
[1:10:58] Safara then we got a
[1:11:00] church that stands
[1:11:03] solid and everybody said
[1:11:07] am okay now y'all can breathe a deep
[1:11:10] breast all of you on the internet you
[1:11:13] preachers that have passed out wake them
[1:11:14] wake them wake them up now because I'm
[1:11:16] going to go to another question now
[1:11:19] y'all can think I'm anointed of the Holy
[1:11:22] Ghost
[1:11:25] now this is from an individual that I
[1:11:28] mentioned to you about that had some
[1:11:30] questions and I asked them if it was all
[1:11:32] right if I use their
[1:11:35] questions it doesn't make any sense to
[1:11:37] me that the Bible says they ate of a
[1:11:41] fruit and somehow out of that we got
[1:11:45] that Eve had sex with a
[1:11:51] snake my answer to this individual when
[1:11:53] I was there with them and their home was
[1:11:56] we do not believe that Eve had sex with
[1:12:00] a
[1:12:01] snake the Bible does not call the
[1:12:04] serpent a
[1:12:05] snake but it says it's the most subtle
[1:12:09] beast of the field now let's read if you
[1:12:12] would in Genesis CH
[1:12:14] 3:1 now the serpent was more subtle than
[1:12:18] any beast of the field which the Lord
[1:12:20] God had made so he was a beast of the
[1:12:25] field and he said unto the
[1:12:30] woman so this is not a
[1:12:33] snake have many ever seen a talking
[1:12:36] snake I mean maybe some two-legged ones
[1:12:39] but you know nothing on their belly so
[1:12:41] this whatever this creature was could
[1:12:45] talk it could reason it could
[1:12:48] think now notice and he said unto the
[1:12:52] woman yeah as God said You shall not eat
[1:12:56] of every tree of the
[1:12:58] garden and the woman said unto the
[1:13:01] serpent so he's not you know standing up
[1:13:03] on his tail and and she's
[1:13:09] interpreting and then out of that she
[1:13:11] gets this interpretation of well the
[1:13:13] Lord God said this no he's actually
[1:13:16] talking cuz he had a
[1:13:18] voice and it was not on his belly but he
[1:13:22] was standing up
[1:13:24] right and the woman said unto the
[1:13:26] serpent we may eat of the
[1:13:31] fruit of the
[1:13:33] Trees of the
[1:13:35] garden look up here on the screen now at
[1:13:38] the meaning of the word
[1:13:43] fruit wow produce of the ground also the
[1:13:47] same word in the Hebrew sense is used
[1:13:49] for the word
[1:13:52] offspring
[1:13:54] Children
[1:13:56] progyny of the
[1:13:58] womb wow so we ain't talking about an
[1:14:01] apple or a Pon or a peach or a pear it
[1:14:05] was a pear all right the pear on the
[1:14:10] ground not the p e a r but the woman and
[1:14:15] the
[1:14:16] serpent so look at what she said now we
[1:14:20] may eat of the fruit of the tree
[1:14:24] of the
[1:14:25] garden now does God always come right
[1:14:30] out and speak plain and simple or does
[1:14:34] God sometimes Veil his terms we know he
[1:14:38] does what's this in Genesis
[1:14:41] 30:2 Jacob's anger was kindled against
[1:14:44] Rachel and he said am I God said a you
[1:14:47] remember the Bible Rachel is really
[1:14:48] upset because she's not had any children
[1:14:50] and she comes to to Jacob and said give
[1:14:52] me children there I die give me children
[1:14:54] there I die and he said am I God am I
[1:14:57] God dead who hath withheld from
[1:15:01] Thee the fruit of the
[1:15:05] womb so this was common then in the
[1:15:08] Hebrew language that children or The
[1:15:11] Offspring were considered to be fruit of
[1:15:15] the womb Deuteronomy 7:13 he will love
[1:15:18] thee and bless thee Moses prophesying
[1:15:21] now to the children of Israel he will
[1:15:23] love thee and bless thee and multiply
[1:15:25] thee he will also bless the
[1:15:29] fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy
[1:15:34] land and thy corn and thy wine so God
[1:15:38] uses the term fruit not only to describe
[1:15:42] what was on the tree but also on the
[1:15:45] woman tree Psalms
[1:15:48] 1273 Lo children are an Heritage of the
[1:15:52] Lord and the fruit of the
[1:15:55] womb is his
[1:15:58] reward so then does the bible also take
[1:16:03] trees are trees always mentioned in the
[1:16:07] Bible in the literal sense or can trees
[1:16:11] be used in a sign as a symbol or
[1:16:15] metaphorically in other words God would
[1:16:18] use a tree but it wouldn't actually mean
[1:16:21] something s there with bark and branches
[1:16:23] and leaves so look in Psalms 1:2 blessed
[1:16:28] is the man who walketh not the counts of
[1:16:30] the ungodly this is why D David starts
[1:16:33] it out and in verse two he said his
[1:16:35] Delight is in the law of the Lord and in
[1:16:37] his law does he meditate day and night
[1:16:40] he shall be like
[1:16:42] a tree planted by the rivers of water
[1:16:47] and shall bring forth
[1:16:49] his fruit in his season his
[1:16:54] Leaf so God is taking a tree and
[1:16:57] likening a righteous man or woman to a
[1:17:00] tree and everybody said amen okay now
[1:17:03] watch so God says they can be like that
[1:17:07] Psalms
[1:17:08] 37:35 I've seen the wicked in great
[1:17:11] power and spreading himself like a Green
[1:17:16] Bay Tree Psalms
[1:17:19] 528 I am like a green olive tree in the
[1:17:23] house of God I trust in thy mercy oh God
[1:17:27] forever and ever notice how David
[1:17:29] likened himself to a green olive tree
[1:17:33] now a green olive tree was an olive tree
[1:17:35] in its use it was very flexible so when
[1:17:38] the wind would come it was very flexible
[1:17:41] and David said when I'm in the house of
[1:17:43] God I I'm like a green olive tree I just
[1:17:47] worship and I raise my branches to God
[1:17:50] and the wind comes through and it just
[1:17:52] VI just B in the presence of God so
[1:17:55] David likened himself as a worshipper to
[1:17:58] being like a green olive tree Psalms
[1:18:01] 9212 the righteous shall flourish like
[1:18:04] the palm tree he shall grow like a cedar
[1:18:08] in Lebanon Proverbs 11:30 the fruit of
[1:18:12] the
[1:18:13] righteous oh my goodness the fruit of
[1:18:15] the righteous is a tree of
[1:18:19] life a tree of life he that WTH Sal
[1:18:23] is wise Song of Solomon 2:3 as the apple
[1:18:27] tree among the Trees of the wood so is
[1:18:30] my beloved among the sons this is the
[1:18:32] bride likening the Lord Jesus to an
[1:18:35] apple tree among the rest of the woods
[1:18:38] now an apple tree was a very special
[1:18:40] thing to them because it produces
[1:18:42] constant fruit which they love so she
[1:18:44] looked at Jesus and said that he sticks
[1:18:47] out from arrest of he's just totally
[1:18:50] different from everybody else there's
[1:18:52] something special about him and my heart
[1:18:54] yearns for him so she said he's like an
[1:18:57] apple tree amongst all the rest of the
[1:18:59] Trees of the wood so she's comparing him
[1:19:02] to all the rest of the sons of men I sat
[1:19:05] down under his shadow with great Delight
[1:19:09] Ezekiel 318 the cedars in the garden of
[1:19:13] God could not hide him the fur trees
[1:19:15] were not like his bows and the chestnut
[1:19:18] trees were not like his branches nor any
[1:19:21] tree in the garden of God never remember
[1:19:23] we're talking back past tense but also
[1:19:26] prophetically of the great cherub that
[1:19:28] was in the garden of God and he was like
[1:19:31] a
[1:19:32] tree a tree in the garden now not an oak
[1:19:37] not a walnut not a hickory not a pine
[1:19:40] but a being that was likened to a tree
[1:19:44] look at Daniel's interpretation of the
[1:19:46] King's dream Daniel 4:20 the tree that
[1:19:50] thou sawest which grew and was strong
[1:19:53] whose height reached unto Heaven and the
[1:19:55] sight thereof to all the Earth whose
[1:19:57] leaves were fair and the fruit thereof
[1:20:00] much and it was meat for all under which
[1:20:03] the beasts of the field dwelt and upon
[1:20:05] whose branches the fowls of the heaven
[1:20:07] had their
[1:20:10] habitation it is thou oh King now you
[1:20:15] wonder why the God why that God would
[1:20:17] give this man this complicated dream why
[1:20:21] didn't God just tell him hey look buddy
[1:20:22] you know what you're the beginning of
[1:20:24] the Gentile Kingdom and and you're the
[1:20:26] main man right now okay you got it okay
[1:20:28] it's that simple but God don't do it
[1:20:30] that way God wants to reveal himself
[1:20:32] through
[1:20:34] prophecy he loves to reveal himself
[1:20:37] through correct prophecy so he gives
[1:20:39] this man this complicated dream and then
[1:20:43] the way dreams were interpreted was by a
[1:20:46] prophet so the Prophet Daniel and the
[1:20:49] prophet of God in our day tells us the
[1:20:51] way that a dream is is interpreted when
[1:20:54] a dream was told to a prophet that the
[1:20:57] prophet sees that dream in a vision
[1:21:01] brother R said people would come to him
[1:21:04] and say brother ROM I had a dream about
[1:21:06] this and this and he said he would start
[1:21:08] seeing their dream and a vision and he'd
[1:21:10] say why did you leave that part out of
[1:21:12] that dream you never told me this and
[1:21:15] you never told me that in the dream
[1:21:17] that's the way a dream was
[1:21:20] interpreted so he would receive the
[1:21:22] dream so the king the king had the dream
[1:21:26] and then Daniel Rees the dream in a
[1:21:28] vision because the god that can show you
[1:21:30] the dream and a vision can certainly
[1:21:32] interpret it to you that's the way
[1:21:34] brother R said you'll know it's a true
[1:21:36] interpretation so here he sees it and
[1:21:38] whenever he gets done with the vision he
[1:21:40] looks at and he says well all these
[1:21:43] branches and and and all this oh oh it
[1:21:47] it's
[1:21:48] you so all these people are gaining
[1:21:51] sustenance on under Europe they're
[1:21:53] getting shade and they're getting
[1:21:54] strength well that's all the kingdoms of
[1:21:57] the known world they're all reaping
[1:21:59] because they're under your bowels and
[1:22:01] under your your leaves and they're
[1:22:03] benefiting by you so oh King the
[1:22:06] tree is
[1:22:09] you praise God John the
[1:22:12] Baptist Matthew 3:8 bring the fruit
[1:22:16] therefore fruits meet for repentance
[1:22:19] think not to say within ourselves
[1:22:21] yourselves we have Abraham to Our Father
[1:22:23] for I say unto you that God is able of
[1:22:26] these stones to raise up children unto
[1:22:27] Abraham now the
[1:22:30] axe is
[1:22:33] laid unto the root of the
[1:22:36] trees so was John fixing to make some
[1:22:39] furniture with John chopping firewood
[1:22:41] cuz he's cold out there and he's fixing
[1:22:43] to make cut down some trees is that what
[1:22:45] John was talking about he was talking
[1:22:47] about them people that was standing
[1:22:49] there and tell him the ax is laid to the
[1:22:51] root of the tree you're fixing to get
[1:22:52] chopped down if you don't get life in
[1:22:55] you that's the way prophets spoke in
[1:22:59] symbols oh praise
[1:23:02] God notice again Jesus Matthew 7:18 a
[1:23:07] great good tree can not bring forth evil
[1:23:09] fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring
[1:23:11] forth good fruit every tree that
[1:23:14] bringeth not forth good fruit is sh Down
[1:23:17] cast into the fire again is Jesus
[1:23:19] talking about going through an orchard
[1:23:22] and cutting them down Matthew 7:20
[1:23:24] wherefore by their fruits you shall know
[1:23:26] them Luke
[1:23:28] 23:30 then shall they begin to say unto
[1:23:31] the mountains fall on us and to the
[1:23:32] hills cover us for they have they do
[1:23:35] these things in a green
[1:23:38] tree and Jesus is identifying him
[1:23:41] himself as a tree what will they do in a
[1:23:47] drive which in case you don't know is
[1:23:51] us now go back to Genesis 3 and we'll
[1:23:53] stop here in a few minutes but of the
[1:23:55] fruit of the tree which is in the midst
[1:23:57] of the garden God has said You shall not
[1:23:59] eat of it neither shall you touch it
[1:24:01] lest you
[1:24:02] die proverbs 30 and 20 such is the way
[1:24:07] of an adulterous
[1:24:11] woman now listen what Eve said but the
[1:24:14] fruit of the tree which is in the midst
[1:24:15] of the garden God has said You shall not
[1:24:18] eat of it eat of it neither shall you
[1:24:21] touch it lest you die such is the way of
[1:24:26] an adulterous
[1:24:29] woman she
[1:24:31] eateth and wipeth her
[1:24:34] mouth and
[1:24:36] saith I have
[1:24:38] done no
[1:24:40] wickedness so to edus was not her
[1:24:43] reaching up on a tree and pting off an
[1:24:46] apple and
[1:24:48] eating it was her partaking of a
[1:24:51] forbidden fruit and the adulterous woman
[1:24:55] eateth and wipeth her mouth and says I
[1:25:00] have done no wickedness now notice again
[1:25:03] in the same term as far as Eed us what
[1:25:06] it means John 653 then Jesus said unto
[1:25:09] them verily verily I say unto you except
[1:25:12] you eat the Flesh of the son of
[1:25:15] man and drink his
[1:25:17] blood you have no life in
[1:25:19] you now how many believe you all have
[1:25:21] the life Christ in you
[1:25:23] tonight have you ever ate his
[1:25:26] flesh anybody here ever drunk of the
[1:25:29] literal blood of the Lord
[1:25:31] Jesus ain't none of us even believes he
[1:25:34] literally meant that do we no for what's
[1:25:39] he talking about in a symbol so
[1:25:42] partaking in the Bible is many times
[1:25:45] identified as
[1:25:47] eating oh my notice this verse 54 who's
[1:25:52] so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood
[1:25:55] has eternal life and I will raise him up
[1:25:59] at the last day for my flesh is me and
[1:26:03] deed you imagine now some of them
[1:26:04] scribes and Pharisees they probably
[1:26:06] thought this man is a canable this man
[1:26:09] is a vampire he's an absolute nut I just
[1:26:13] wonder what these priests now and these
[1:26:15] leaders told their people when they got
[1:26:17] back to church the next Sunday said now
[1:26:20] tell you what I S you down there at that
[1:26:21] meeting and I couldn't believe that you
[1:26:23] was there I'm I'm just telling you I'm I
[1:26:25] was so disappointed in you now surely
[1:26:27] you did not believe I've been telling
[1:26:30] you that man is a Madman I've been
[1:26:32] telling you that man he was born an
[1:26:34] illegitimate child and and they're
[1:26:36] they're all they're all they're all
[1:26:38] weird they're all strange and this guy
[1:26:40] is the worst case that we have ever seen
[1:26:43] this man was standing there and telling
[1:26:44] people they had to literally eat his
[1:26:47] body and drink his blood now you see
[1:26:49] I've been warning you this guy is a
[1:26:51] false false
[1:26:54] prophet but if you would have been a
[1:26:56] seed of God in that day You' have said
[1:26:59] Rabbi I love you with all my heart but
[1:27:03] I'm going to hear Jesus next
[1:27:05] Saturday I'm going to hear Jesus next
[1:27:07] Sunday they wouldn't be able to kept you
[1:27:09] away from it I don't care what they said
[1:27:12] because there's something in his voice
[1:27:14] that was drawing on that seed in your
[1:27:17] soul praise God notice let's jump down
[1:27:20] you to verse 58 this is the
[1:27:24] bread which came down from heaven not as
[1:27:28] your fathers did eat man and are dead
[1:27:30] that he that eateth of this bread shall
[1:27:32] live
[1:27:33] forever back to Genesis 3:4 and the
[1:27:37] serpent said unto the woman you shall
[1:27:39] not surely die for God does know in the
[1:27:43] day that you eat
[1:27:44] thereof your eyes shall be opened and
[1:27:47] you shall be as
[1:27:49] Gods knowing Good and Evil
[1:27:53] verse six so you mean eating an
[1:27:57] apple will open your eyes to Good and
[1:28:01] Evil wow reckon it was a
[1:28:05] Macintosh honey
[1:28:08] crisp I know what it was a granny
[1:28:13] smith you mean eating a fruit will open
[1:28:16] your eyes it's partaking of something
[1:28:21] can I have a few more minutes I can't
[1:28:23] stop right now if you got to go go on
[1:28:25] but I can't stop right now we got to get
[1:28:26] a little bit of this next verse and when
[1:28:29] the woman saw that the tree was
[1:28:34] good for food look at the word
[1:28:39] good
[1:28:41] Pleasant agreeable to the
[1:28:44] senses
[1:28:46] prosperous of man's
[1:28:50] sensuous nature
[1:28:54] now have any of y all ever looked at an
[1:28:56] apple tree and felt that way I'm going
[1:28:59] to tell you you are really
[1:29:02] weird you're really
[1:29:05] strange anybody you you you look at a
[1:29:08] natural tree and a tree a natural tree
[1:29:11] would make you feel this way of course
[1:29:14] it
[1:29:16] wouldn't but she saw that the tree was
[1:29:18] good for food and that it was pleasant
[1:29:23] now remember the Old Testament was
[1:29:25] written in Hebrew not English this is
[1:29:28] the Hebrew word
[1:29:30] t desire longing of one's heart
[1:29:36] lust
[1:29:38] what
[1:29:40] lust appetite
[1:29:43] covetousness object of a
[1:29:47] desire so the woman sees whatever this
[1:29:50] tree was
[1:29:53] she sees it and she goes to feeling
[1:29:55] something she's never felt
[1:29:56] before and it was pleasant to the eyes
[1:30:00] and a tree to be
[1:30:04] desired wow covet take pleasure in to
[1:30:09] Delight greatly
[1:30:12] desire
[1:30:15] greatly to make one
[1:30:18] wise she took
[1:30:22] of the fruit took
[1:30:26] Mary take a
[1:30:30] wife snatch
[1:30:32] away take two or four a person what are
[1:30:36] we talking
[1:30:37] about we're talking about a
[1:30:41] union a sexual Union not reaching up and
[1:30:44] picking a palm ground I oh I so smart
[1:30:48] after eating that
[1:30:49] peach well some of y'all's going to be
[1:30:51] doing that for your next test right

[1:30:56] you want get all the pears all the
[1:30:57] pumpkins whatever more we know better
[1:31:00] than that you know what I I feel so
[1:31:01] sorry for the people of the world that
[1:31:03] read this Bible they read this Genesis
[1:31:06] forwards and backwards and they read
[1:31:08] right over the top of this this is one
[1:31:09] of the Mysteries to be restored in the
[1:31:12] last day and we understand it thank God
[1:31:16] thank God so she took of the fruit
[1:31:21] thereof and did eat and gave also unto
[1:31:26] her husband with
[1:31:31] her she gave unto her husband with
[1:31:37] her his partaking was not by
[1:31:41] himself but with
[1:31:44] her and he did eat and the eyes of them
[1:31:49] both were open
[1:31:52] and they knew that they were
[1:31:56] naked I repeat what brother random said
[1:31:59] if eating apples makes people realize
[1:32:01] are naked we need to pass the apples
[1:32:04] again and somebody said and the eyes of
[1:32:07] them BS were opened and they knew that
[1:32:10] they were naked and they seed fig leaves
[1:32:13] together and made themselves a face
[1:32:20] mask
[1:32:23] wa now wait a minute if the mouse is the
[1:32:26] guilty part why are they sewing fig
[1:32:30] leaves
[1:32:31] together to make themselves a loin cloth
[1:32:38] right now the English says
[1:32:41] apron but look at the Hebrew word loin
[1:32:45] covering
[1:32:47] belt or loin
[1:32:49] cloths so they ate with ser
[1:32:52] mouth and they cover the middle part of
[1:32:54] their
[1:32:59] body yes
[1:33:00] sir why they're
[1:33:04] covering where they were
[1:33:08] guilty oh my goodness and made
[1:33:12] themselves loin
[1:33:15] cloths verse n and the Lord God called
[1:33:17] unto Adam and said Where Art Thou and he
[1:33:19] said I heard thy voice in the garden and
[1:33:21] I was afraid
[1:33:22] because I hid I was naked and I hid
[1:33:24] myself and he said
[1:33:27] who not what tree not what
[1:33:31] fruit
[1:33:32] who told thee that thou was naked hast
[1:33:35] thou eaten of the tree whereof I
[1:33:37] commanded thee that thou should us not
[1:33:38] eat and the man said the woman who thou
[1:33:41] gavest to be with me she gave me of the
[1:33:43] tree she gave me of the tree and I did
[1:33:46] eat and the Lord God said un the woman
[1:33:49] what is this that thou has done and the
[1:33:51] woman said said the serpent
[1:33:54] beguiled
[1:33:56] deceived to be
[1:33:58] beguiled the serpent beguiles me and I
[1:34:03] did
[1:34:04] eat
[1:34:06] wow Paul in 2 Corinthians 11:2 for I
[1:34:09] jealous over you with Godly jealousy for
[1:34:11] I have espoused you to one husband that
[1:34:13] I may present you as a Chase virgin to
[1:34:15] Christ but I fear lest by any means as
[1:34:19] the
[1:34:20] serpent Opus this is the Greek word with
[1:34:24] the Ancients the serpent was an emblem
[1:34:27] of cunning and wisdom the serpent who
[1:34:30] deceived Eve was regarded by the Jews as
[1:34:35] the
[1:34:39] devil and yet here Paul is talking about
[1:34:41] the New Testament Church and them
[1:34:44] getting married why in the world would
[1:34:46] he go back to the Garden of Eden because
[1:34:49] once again you have a another
[1:34:54] Eve and the Lord God said unto the
[1:34:56] serpent because thou has done this Thou
[1:34:58] Art cursed above all cattle above every
[1:35:01] beast of the
[1:35:02] field upon thy
[1:35:06] belly upon thy belly shalt thou go and
[1:35:10] dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy
[1:35:13] life so he was not on his belly until
[1:35:17] then I will put imity between thee and
[1:35:20] the woman
[1:35:22] and between thy seed I thought most
[1:35:26] snakes laid
[1:35:28] eggs there only about seven pieces of
[1:35:31] them that actually live Bear all the
[1:35:33] rest of them lay eggs God wasn't
[1:35:36] speaking to a
[1:35:37] snake so you mean the serpent had a seed
[1:35:41] people say oh that serpent seeds of the
[1:35:43] devil I agree with that but the doctrine
[1:35:47] is the truth from God serpent seeds of
[1:35:49] the devil but God God said the serpent
[1:35:52] had a seed we going to believe God or
[1:35:55] some doctor of theology I'll believe
[1:35:59] God Amen let's stand together look at
[1:36:02] this word seed I will put imity between
[1:36:05] thee and the woman between thy
[1:36:09] seed look at the meaning of the word thy
[1:36:12] seed sewing Offspring
[1:36:16] Sean
[1:36:18] descendants
[1:36:20] posterity ch
[1:36:22] children it's just as plain as plain can
[1:36:25] be sir when God opens your
[1:36:28] understanding unto the woman he said I
[1:36:31] will greatly
[1:36:33] multiply thy chewing and thy
[1:36:36] Bing because thou bidest an apple off of
[1:36:39] the tree from now on when you eat your
[1:36:42] supper you will have great pain in your
[1:36:48] mouse
[1:36:50] what
[1:36:51] that wasn't
[1:36:52] it
[1:36:54] well well my goodness how strange God
[1:36:57] said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow
[1:37:00] and
[1:37:02] thy
[1:37:03] what
[1:37:05] conception what's that got to do even an
[1:37:08] apple God's punishing the area where the
[1:37:11] guilt is yes
[1:37:14] sir oh my and thy
[1:37:19] desire longing
[1:37:21] craving of a man for a woman or a woman
[1:37:25] for a man why is God dealing with
[1:37:29] this why do you think there had to be a
[1:37:34] virgin
[1:37:37] birth If the fall was by eating of fruit
[1:37:41] then Redemption should have been yes sir
[1:37:44] the Lord Jesus coming from heaven with
[1:37:47] some type of fruit off the tree of life
[1:37:49] or some of the fruit we're going to eat
[1:37:51] eat and live forever because our youth
[1:37:52] will be renewed forever the prophet
[1:37:54] tells us and the Lord Jesus comes down
[1:37:57] and he brings all these B just back
[1:37:59] baskets and baskets and baskets of fruit
[1:38:03] that's Redemption because that was the
[1:38:05] cause of the Fall according to most
[1:38:06] people then we go over and we take of
[1:38:09] that fruit and we eat of it and we got
[1:38:11] eternal life and we go back to and young
[1:38:14] men and young women and we never get
[1:38:17] sick so why was it there had to be a
[1:38:20] virgin to
[1:38:22] conceive because God prophesied and said
[1:38:25] your seed
[1:38:27] serpent will be against the seed of the
[1:38:30] woman and the woman don't even have a
[1:38:31] seed she has an a field an egg the seed
[1:38:36] comes from the man God prophesying
[1:38:38] saying I will create a seed God did
[1:38:44] aren't you glad he
[1:38:46] did praise the Lord let's bow our heads
[1:38:50] together
[1:38:55] praise the
[1:38:58] Lord oh Jesus we thank you for this
[1:39:01] privilege tonight
[1:39:03] father that we would be able to come
[1:39:05] together Lord and try my best to answer
[1:39:08] the questions of these young people
[1:39:12] they're not asking them to be
[1:39:13] argumentative lord they're not asking
[1:39:15] them to debate they want to
[1:39:18] know Lord I pray that you would help me
[1:39:22] I've got many more that they've asked
[1:39:24] about various subjects and I'm seeking
[1:39:27] your leadership Lord on how to answer
[1:39:30] them even what order to put them in Lord
[1:39:34] I pray you'd help me I'm grateful that
[1:39:37] they're willing to come Lord many of you
[1:39:40] here last night and they turn right back
[1:39:43] around and come again tonight to be able
[1:39:47] to be in this
[1:39:49] service I pray you'd bless for that
[1:39:51] effort father may you open our
[1:39:55] understanding thank you for letting us
[1:39:57] see this great truth
[1:39:59] Lord we're so glad that we really
[1:40:03] understand what Redemption is all
[1:40:07] about we thank you that we can see
[1:40:10] father why you had to come to the Earth
[1:40:13] you could not come as an angel you had
[1:40:17] to come as a man Adam as a man forfeited
[1:40:22] our rights in the Garden of Eden Jesus
[1:40:25] as a man you forfeited your rights in
[1:40:29] the Garden of
[1:40:31] Gethsemane that we could stand here
[1:40:33] tonight and be
[1:40:35] saved it was lost through a
[1:40:39] woman a woman
[1:40:41] falling in
[1:40:43] Paradise it would be regained by another
[1:40:47] woman Mary a woman turned it down
[1:40:51] another woman accepted it and gave the
[1:40:54] word her body by which the word could be
[1:40:59] created and grow inside of her not one
[1:41:03] Speck of her blood was in your body but
[1:41:07] it was holy created blood so if there's
[1:41:10] a cner here tonight or a
[1:41:12] backslider they're not made clean by The
[1:41:14] Blood of Mary and Joseph but they're
[1:41:18] made clean by the blood of God
[1:41:22] we love you tonight Jesus I pray for
[1:41:25] those maybe that's been around the
[1:41:26] message for years and years if they live

[1:41:31] it up to them and make it even clearer
[1:41:33] than it's ever been before I never study

[1:41:39] thank you for that it lets us know that

[1:41:48] go to reading it every time we go to
[1:41:50] studying and applying ourselves we find
[1:41:53] the same tape we listened to before the
[1:41:55] same book we read before we'll get more

[1:54:13] God enjoy that
[1:54:18] tonight
[1:54:23] I told brother Donnie last Thursday
[1:54:24] night that I I realized how little I
[1:54:27] know when you
[1:54:30] hear when let me rephrase that how
[1:54:33] little of simple things that I
[1:54:36] know because the devil will try to make
[1:54:39] you over complicated I remember when I
[1:54:41] was a teenager you know I was I was in
[1:54:44] church but that was it I was raised in
[1:54:47] church I did my thing I was backslid
[1:54:50] I did whatever backslid Church kid
[1:54:54] does and I always
[1:54:56] thought that I wasn't a Christian
[1:54:58] because I couldn't understand
[1:55:00] things I always thought you read the
[1:55:02] Bible you go to church you hear it
[1:55:04] preached you're supposed to if you're a
[1:55:05] Christian if you got the Holy Ghost and
[1:55:07] you're going to understand it all you
[1:55:09] know when he was he was talking a while
[1:55:11] ago about when Jesus told the disciples
[1:55:14] Jesus looked at everybody that was there
[1:55:16] and he's in his in his heart Jesus says
[1:55:18] this is too many
[1:55:20] there's too many of y'all except you eat
[1:55:23] my flesh you drink my blood you'll have
[1:55:25] no part and they all turned it left and
[1:55:29] walked
[1:55:30] away except the 12 you got to understand
[1:55:33] them 12 still didn't know what he
[1:55:35] meant they didn't know what he
[1:55:37] meant but they knew who he was thank you
[1:55:42] thank Lord questions and answers didn't
[1:55:44] happen in 1960s and
[1:55:47] 50s that happened in the four gopel
[1:55:50] Els Jesus would talk to the the
[1:55:54] Pharisees he would talk to the go the
[1:55:56] synagogue and he would say the sewer
[1:55:58] went forth and he sowed seed some fell
[1:56:00] on the good ground some fell in amongst
[1:56:02] the thorns and the thistles and some
[1:56:03] fell on the
[1:56:04] [Music]
[1:56:06] stones talk about the the man the rich
[1:56:10] man owned the vineyard and he gave it to
[1:56:11] his son and he gave an overseer and he
[1:56:13] would talk to these Parables they
[1:56:16] wouldn't the disciples had predestinated
[1:56:19] eternal life and they didn't understand
[1:56:21] it so what would they do they would go
[1:56:23] have question and answers with
[1:56:25] him what did you mean by this what did
[1:56:29] you mean by that and the Bible says he
[1:56:33] said it so they could
[1:56:36] understand so if you don't like question
[1:56:38] and
[1:56:40] answers I love
[1:56:42] it I love it cuz I I have to have things
[1:56:45] simple if brother brandom hadn't
[1:56:46] preached God in Simplicity before he
[1:56:48] preached the breach in the seals I still
[1:56:51] will not have understanding cuz he
[1:56:53] explains so much in God in Simplicity to
[1:56:56] not overthink them
[1:56:58] seals so just sometimes say you got a
[1:57:02] question you don't understand don't let
[1:57:04] Satan beat you up with that
[1:57:07] that's we we got a pastor here that's as
[1:57:10] we he read that quote I'm going to I'm
[1:57:12] going to have him send me that quote
[1:57:13] because brother brandom said that's what
[1:57:15] the pastor is for for doing question and
[1:57:17] answers that's what I got out of it and
[1:57:19] probably wasn't in that verbiage itself
[1:57:21] pastor's duty is to answer the question
[1:57:23] and
[1:57:24] answers so I appreciate it I appreciate
[1:57:28] it I'm looking for the next one I guess
[1:57:30] we're going to for a little while go
[1:57:31] every other Thursday or whatever he says
[1:57:34] so me and me and brother Rob think we
[1:57:36] got the rains for a little bit and then
[1:57:38] we find out we're just we got the
[1:57:41] bits but we love it I I I appreciate
[1:57:44] y'all every one of you I I count it an
[1:57:46] honor to be one of your brothers and
[1:57:49] it's it's an honor to serve with brother
[1:57:51] Rob brother Joel and brother brother
[1:57:53] Daryl and and the pastor it's just a
[1:57:55] it's an
[1:57:56] honor you know we're we're going to
[1:57:58] we're getting through Satan's
[1:57:59] Eden the minute of the Rapture you still
[1:58:01] probably won't understand
[1:58:03] everything so brother BR said pray for
[1:58:06] understanding pray for understanding and
[1:58:08] turn in your
[1:58:09] question so I love you with all my heart
[1:58:13] um look forward to I look forward to
