[35:02] in your name, healing.
[35:06] Oh God, I pray that you would help us
[35:08] tonight as we look into your word. No
[35:11] doubt there's multiple needs in the
[35:14] people's lives that are here and those
[35:16] that are streaming the service. And we
[35:18] know that you are the same yesterday,
[35:20] today, and forever. Take your word
[35:23] tonight, Father. Speak to us. We know
[35:26] that you are identified by the way you
[35:28] break bread. So would you break the
[35:30] bread among us tonight in your manner of
[35:34] doing it. We commit the service, the
[35:37] speaker, the hearers.
[35:39] May the glory of God be made manifest
[35:41] among us tonight. We ask in the name of
[35:44] the Lord Jesus.
[35:46] Amen. Praise the Lord. Saints, isn't it
[35:50] a privilege to be called by the name of
[35:52] Jesus Christ?
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:55] Genesis chapter 24
[35:57] verse 58.
[36:03] And they called Rebecca and said unto
[36:06] her, "Wil thou go with this man?"
[36:10] And she said, "I will go."
[36:14] And they sent away Rebecca, their
[36:17] sister, and her nurse,
[36:20] and Abraham's servant, and his men. Now,
[36:25] notice, he wasn't by himself.
[36:27] But he had men that were with him
[36:31] carrying out this commission from his
[36:34] master.
[36:36] And they blessed Rebecca, and said unto
[36:38] her, "Thou art our sister. Be thou the
[36:41] mother of thousands of millions, and let
[36:44] thy seed possess the gate of those which
[36:49] hate them.
[36:52] And Rebecca arose and her damsels, and
[36:54] they rode upon the camels, and followed
[36:58] the man. And the servant took Rebecca
[37:02] and went his way. May the Lord bless his
[37:06] word. You may be seated.
[37:09] I'd like to speak to you tonight on
[37:13] the bride's
[37:15] dowry.
[37:18] Shalu him
[37:20] is the Hebrew word. Shalu him. H I M
[37:24] him. Shaloo him.
[37:29] given to the bride by her father
[37:33] to equip her for her new life. And in
[37:38] this case, not only her new life, but
[37:41] the journey of
[37:44] 450 to 500 miles on the back of a camel.
[37:49] And the anotype of that believers are
[37:53] given gifts from our father to help us
[37:58] in our journey. Rebecca may have thought
[38:01] she had a long time in her journey. Two
[38:03] months that ain't nothing compared to
[38:05] what some of y'all have journeyed in
[38:06] this way, is it? All these years. And
[38:10] yet our father is faithful to give us
[38:13] everything that we need to equip us for
[38:16] what's necessary and essential to help
[38:19] get us through this journey and lead us
[38:23] into our new life. And there's many
[38:27] things of course that our father has
[38:29] given to us and we've dealt with a
[38:31] couple of them already. But tonight we'd
[38:33] like to pick up if we can again from
[38:36] what Paul by the grace of God was
[38:38] allowed to bring to the Ephesian church
[38:41] and share the abundance of the
[38:43] revelation that God had given to him in
[38:46] that first church age. Things that had
[38:48] been opened to him only of all the
[38:52] preachers and wonderful men of God that
[38:54] there were in that time frame. But God
[38:57] illuminated Paul to be able to see
[38:59] things that Peter which had walked with
[39:02] the Lord Jesus. James which was a halfb
[39:04] brotherther uh did not see. Many of the
[39:07] other brethren Andrew um did not
[39:10] understand. But yet God had given it to
[39:13] Paul. So read with me if you would in
[39:14] Ephesians chapter 3 verse 8. Unto me who
[39:18] am less than the least of all saints.
[39:23] Now listen to this. unto me who am less
[39:28] than the least of all saints. I can
[39:32] listen to a preacher like this. I have a
[39:34] hard time listening to a preacher that's
[39:36] got his thumb in his mouth and he's all
[39:38] time blowing his own horn and blowing
[39:40] himself up how big he is. I ain't got
[39:42] much time for a guy like that. Do you? I
[39:44] can follow a man like this because now
[39:46] he's not trying to be humble. He's
[39:49] saying it because it was the truth. Now
[39:51] there's a paradox that lays in this.
[39:53] unto me who am less than the least of
[39:57] all saints. Is this grace given that I
[40:01] should preach among the Gentiles the
[40:05] uncarchable riches of Christ? by the
[40:09] uncarchable riches are those abundant
[40:11] mercies that God had just recently just
[40:15] a few years now since this book of
[40:17] Ephesians was written and astonishingly
[40:21] had opened up to the Gentiles. Now
[40:23] remember, God kept this a secret and it
[40:26] was not fully made known until the
[40:29] church was birthed. There's some truths
[40:33] that God once proclaimed by the
[40:35] foolishness of preaching and there's
[40:39] other things that God wants manifested
[40:42] actually by natural fulfillment in
[40:46] people's lives. So God shared a few
[40:49] things in the Old Testament of a few of
[40:51] the gentile women that were brought into
[40:53] the very lineage naturally of the Lord
[40:55] Jesus. And now Paul is writing about how
[40:58] great this was. And he calls it
[41:00] unsearchable riches of Christ. So the
[41:03] treasures of grace which God had not
[41:05] only given to the Jews but even more
[41:08] mysterious how that God had opened the
[41:10] treasures of grace unto the Gentiles.
[41:12] Now look in verse 9. And he said to make
[41:15] all men see what is the fellowship of
[41:20] the mystery which from the beginning of
[41:23] the world has been hid in God. from the
[41:27] beginning of the world had been hidden
[41:30] God. Now remember, it was in the heart
[41:32] of God. The gospel, the New Testament,
[41:35] the new covenant, it was in the heart of
[41:37] God and it had not yet even been
[41:40] revealed to angels. Now listen
[41:43] carefully. The prophets could only see a
[41:46] certain element of it, but the angels of
[41:49] God did not even understand it until
[41:53] years later. and they were watching the
[41:57] divine theatrics of God as it unfolded
[42:02] in the lives of his people. Now God
[42:05] loves doing things this way. So in the
[42:08] heart of God and his counsel that God
[42:11] had to give grace and mercy unto the
[42:13] Gentiles. So now this is the source of
[42:16] the gospel. What is the gospel of the
[42:18] good news? So what is the source? In the
[42:20] very heart of God that God would open it
[42:22] up. So in the heart of God shows us how
[42:25] sacred that it was to him. The safest
[42:29] place it could be was in the heart of
[42:31] God. The most secret place that it could
[42:35] be was in the heart of God. So it was
[42:38] hid from the elect angels. Hid from the
[42:42] Old Testament saints. Now watch as Paul
[42:45] goes on in verse 10. To the intent. Now
[42:48] this is part of what's in your dowy
[42:50] bride. I know that we hear it so much
[42:53] and many of you have heard it since you
[42:55] were small children in Sunday school.
[42:57] But I wonder sometimes if this grace
[42:59] that we participate of every day in our
[43:02] life is not so common that the
[43:05] supernatural and the extent of it is so
[43:08] far beyond what any of us, including me
[43:12] and all of us sitting here tonight still
[43:15] comprehend to this day. If we're talking
[43:18] about something that is so phenomenal
[43:21] that the angels of God watch daily as
[43:26] they see the gospel unfold because God
[43:29] chose to keep it a mystery even from
[43:32] them. And yet we count it just everyday
[43:35] stuff. We just live in the grace of God
[43:37] and we live our lives and we go to
[43:38] church and we do what's right. And yet
[43:40] we don't understand that God has the
[43:45] church as the university
[43:48] of angelic beings.
[43:51] Now can you imagine that angels this
[43:53] very day have watched your lives? Angels
[43:58] have watched my life. Angels have
[44:01] watched the lives of the saints of God
[44:04] around the world. and they've watched
[44:07] the administration of grace, mercy,
[44:11] power, healing, deliverance, and they're
[44:14] watching as God is dealing with his
[44:16] people. Now, you understand that that
[44:18] God that God chose to go this way. It's
[44:22] like that. His church is the university
[44:26] of grace and the university of mercy and
[44:30] the university of goodness and kindness
[44:34] and the university of redemption. And
[44:37] every one of you that are saved by the
[44:39] grace of God, elected in the body of
[44:42] Christ, it's like that you are a
[44:45] professor
[44:47] in this university.
[44:49] That you are a professor. Oh my
[44:52] &gt;&gt; in this university of God and they are
[44:56] watching as God not only through your
[44:58] lips and not only the angels hearing of
[45:01] what preachers are preaching but seeing
[45:04] the manifestation of what God is doing
[45:06] in our lives in this great university of
[45:10] Elohim
[45:11] and who has qualified us to be
[45:14] professors. I'll tell you who did the
[45:17] grace of God.
[45:18] the mercy of God that has been extended
[45:21] to us. Then God allows us to teach the
[45:26] angels of those things which they do not
[45:29] know or understand personally. I'm
[45:33] laying a big foundation and so I hope
[45:36] you you hang with me. Now watch. To the
[45:38] intent that now
[45:41] unto the principalities
[45:45] and powers
[45:48] in heavenly places
[45:50] might be known by the church. So God is
[45:54] using the church to teach
[45:58] principalities.
[46:00] principalities. The Greek word is archo
[46:02] which is the first one in a series of
[46:06] creation.
[46:08] So God kept this mystery of grace from
[46:11] the angels. Oh the stars, the universe,
[46:14] the planets, how marvelous it is. I I
[46:17] love looking at it. I I love studying
[46:19] plants and trees and the stratosphere,
[46:22] the hemisphere, you know, all of those
[46:24] great things that God made. But yet you
[46:26] understand that grace is not manifested
[46:30] in the stratosphere.
[46:32] Grace is not manifested in the
[46:34] hemisphere or in rocks or in plants.
[46:37] Plants don't need grace. They don't need
[46:39] mercy. They operate by different law.
[46:42] And God chose one channel that would be
[46:45] the instructive channel that his church
[46:48] would teach the angels of God. And it
[46:51] was through the channel of redemption
[46:54] and reconciliation.
[46:56] Because God left this mystery of
[46:58] redemption out of the star life, out of
[47:02] the sunlight, out of the moonlight, out
[47:04] of the leaves, out of botney life, out
[47:07] of animal life. They they they don't
[47:10] they don't have it. They they cannot
[47:11] project it. And God held the law of
[47:14] reproduction and seed kind after kind
[47:16] and multiplication and so on and so on.
[47:19] and they themselves bear great witness
[47:21] to the power of God. But yet when it
[47:23] come to grace, mercy, reconciliation,
[47:27] there was perfections of God that could
[47:30] never be manifested in spoken word and
[47:33] creating stars. He could manifest his
[47:36] greatness. And we know that the worlds
[47:39] were were made by him and they are
[47:41] upheld by his power, not by his grace,
[47:45] not by his mercy. The stars aren't held
[47:48] there by forgiveness. Hallelujah. But
[47:51] you understand how you're held by
[47:54] forgiveness.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; You understand how you're held day by
[47:57] day by mercy.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; The stars are held. The universe has
[48:01] been held. It was there before there's
[48:03] ever a man on the earth. So God never
[48:05] put them there to operate by the law of
[48:08] grace and mercy and forgiveness. The
[48:10] stars never fail. The stars never
[48:12] sinned. They don't need forgiveness, but
[48:15] we do.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; We do. And truly, God used the stars as
[48:20] a universe. In the Old Testament was
[48:22] given as a Bible. Remember when God came
[48:25] to Job and what did God do? God quoted
[48:28] to Job the Bible that Job read and knew.
[48:32] Genesis was not written then. Leviticus,
[48:35] Exodus, Deuteronomy, none of those. So
[48:37] God quoted to Job the Bible that Job
[48:40] knew and it was in the stars. And that's
[48:42] why God called the name Arcturus,
[48:44] Pletes, the seven sisters and all of
[48:47] those things. Why? Because it was
[48:49] written in the stars and Job could see
[48:51] it. But it was not from there that Job
[48:53] received the revelation that I know that
[48:56] my redeemer would live. How did he do
[48:58] that? He went forward in time to when
[49:01] the university of the church would be
[49:03] fully made manifest and God would come
[49:06] to perform the work of redemption. Do
[49:08] you understand that there's perfections
[49:10] of God that can only be revealed in the
[49:14] church?
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Watch this. To the intent that now unto
[49:20] the principalities and powers in
[49:23] heavenly places or in heavenly realms
[49:25] might be known by the church. So the
[49:28] sense is that with the grand design that
[49:31] God would make it possible that the
[49:34] greatest of his glories would actually
[49:36] be revealed by him reaching down and
[49:39] pulling people up. And we look at
[49:42] ourselves and we think, "Oh God, you
[49:44] know, we're so low down and we're so
[49:46] rotten and we're worth nothing." And yet
[49:48] God is teaching things out of our lives
[49:51] every day that hold the angel
[49:54] spellbound.
[49:55] Can you imagine that? The angels of God,
[49:59] the angels of God, according to the
[50:02] master of the angels himself
[50:06] said that the angels in heaven rejoice
[50:09] or have joy when a sinner will repent.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Now the angels don't shout in heaven
[50:17] when we shout on earth. They don't run
[50:20] in heaven when we run on earth. But they
[50:23] joy. The only time the scripture points
[50:26] in the New Testament to the exuberance
[50:29] or a building up in an angelic realm
[50:32] that they would have a higher measure of
[50:35] joy than they already have in their
[50:37] created state. And it's when a sinner
[50:40] comes to the Lord Jesus.
[50:42] Can you imagine that our lives on earth
[50:45] so impact heaven that what we are doing
[50:48] day by day and how God is ministering to
[50:51] us and it's not just all on those
[50:53] miraculous days of our life. Some of the
[50:56] greatest manifestations of God are in
[50:59] the lowest times of our life and when we
[51:01] are the least deserving of God's mercy
[51:04] and God will reach down beyond our
[51:06] failures and our mistakes. Can anybody
[51:08] say amen tonight? And God out of that
[51:11] will manifest his power. And he has
[51:14] given the angels one of the greatest
[51:16] demonstrations of the mystery of grace
[51:19] that they've ever saw in their being
[51:22] existence.
[51:23] So the grand purpose of God in the
[51:26] creation was to unveil a certain element
[51:29] of his power. And of course we know it's
[51:30] written in the stars and the glory. But
[51:32] yet there's an element of God that could
[51:35] never be expressed any other way except
[51:38] through the channel of redemption. So
[51:40] God created these intelligent beings
[51:44] which would have been there and we know
[51:45] that he created them in spheres or in
[51:48] dimensions. So there's angels, there's
[51:51] cherubams, there's saraphims, there's
[51:52] zooms and each one of them have a
[51:55] different glory. But he hid from them
[51:57] the mystery of redemption. So they peer
[52:01] into man's salvation. They look and they
[52:05] stoop and look into the mystery of man
[52:08] receiving the Holy Ghost, something they
[52:10] have never been able to receive. And
[52:12] they try to comprehend what it's like.
[52:16] Now notice these intelligent beings
[52:18] which are messengers from his divine
[52:21] presence. They can bring prophecy of
[52:24] future events. They can tell of
[52:26] destructions of kingdoms. They can
[52:28] foretell of things that God will
[52:31] illuminate them to a prophecy. And yet
[52:34] not a one of those angels can pat the
[52:37] seed of life to ever lead a son or
[52:41] daughter of God to a new birth.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Now remember the angel of
[52:46] God could come to Philillip and tell him
[52:48] you go over there and do this and this.
[52:49] But the angel didn't pack the seed. Only
[52:52] Philillip packed the seed because the
[52:54] seed comes through the body.
[52:57] Now in this different rank that the
[53:00] angels of God are in, no doubt they have
[53:03] different understandings by which God
[53:05] has illuminated them too. But the
[53:08] highest of them in their reign do not
[53:11] understand the grace of God. So it was
[53:13] the intent of the Almighty that he would
[53:17] use the lesser to teach the greater. Now
[53:21] don't be overwhelmed by this tonight.
[53:22] Remember Solomon, the man that had such
[53:25] wisdom on the earth. And a man with such
[53:28] great profound wisdom would go to one of
[53:30] the lowest creatures on the earth and
[53:34] would say, "Consider
[53:36] the ant."
[53:37] &gt;&gt; That's right. So he would go and bring
[53:40] man out of his lofty position and go to
[53:43] one of the most humble little creatures
[53:45] that God made and put him on the earth
[53:48] and spends most of his life on his
[53:50] little four legs is going around and
[53:52] eating and reproducing and all the stuff
[53:54] that they would do. And he said also the
[53:57] horse leech and consider this and
[53:59] consider that. So what is God doing? God
[54:02] is taking something beneath man and say,
[54:05] "Look, if you'll look into this, you'll
[54:08] be able to see a mystery of my doing
[54:11] that will be able to help you and your
[54:13] own journey of life." So if an ant could
[54:17] help us to understand, why would we find
[54:20] it hard to believe that God could take a
[54:23] man or woman that is truly born of the
[54:25] spirit of God and say, "Angels, if you
[54:28] want to understand my perfection,
[54:31] watch Donnie.
[54:33] If you want to understand the extent of
[54:35] my grace, watch Brother Daryl. Watch
[54:39] this man, this woman, this boy, this
[54:41] girl that you at one time thought was
[54:44] beyond grace, but watch how great my
[54:48] grace is.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Now notice again, Paul says, to the
[54:52] intent that now unto the principalities
[54:55] and powers in heavenly places might be
[55:00] known. I I love this word this Greek
[55:02] word known declare
[55:05] certify give to understand be recognized
[55:11] to gain knowledge of have thorough
[55:16] knowledge of. So the angelic host will
[55:20] gain an element of divine knowledge as
[55:23] Paul said that they might be known by
[55:27] not the Lord Jesus, not by the cherubams
[55:30] that will teach the lower Christ of
[55:32] angels, but through the church. The
[55:36] church will actually make known part of
[55:39] the great display of God that the
[55:41] cherubams know absolutely nothing about.
[55:45] Can't you see friends when people turn
[55:47] down this simple plan of salvation what
[55:51] a judgment awaits them at the white
[55:54] throne. They are turning down something
[55:56] that is so great that the angels of God
[56:00] for the over the last 2,000 years have
[56:04] been looking into this and trying to
[56:07] comprehend it. and they are still
[56:09] accumulating grace and they're watching
[56:12] knowledge of grace and knowledge of
[56:14] understanding and knowledge of
[56:16] forgiveness and knowledge of God
[56:17] building the statue of a perfect man.
[56:20] And the angels of God are watching as
[56:22] God unfolds it. Notice that it might be
[56:26] known by the church the manifold wisdom
[56:31] of God. Now notice in Paul before he
[56:34] ever says this about a church, Paul
[56:36] brings it into himself and he said, "I
[56:38] am the least. I'm I'm I'm below the very
[56:41] least of the saints." Now watch what
[56:43] he's doing. He's bringing himself into
[56:45] the image of this verse before he gets
[56:48] to the most sublime part. Because God
[56:52] had chosen him who was the least among
[56:56] the saints to bring things out that had
[57:00] never been uttered since before the
[57:02] foundation of the world. Not an angel,
[57:05] not a cherubam, not a seraraphim. Even
[57:07] the Lord Jesus when he was on the earth
[57:10] did not bring some of these things that
[57:13] Paul brought. And was it a great mighty
[57:15] man? Was it a great man that all the
[57:17] world would acknowledge? It was the the
[57:20] one that was below the least of the
[57:23] saints of God. So if we want to get big,
[57:25] I'll tell you how to do it. Get little
[57:27] and stay little in your own sight. Don't
[57:30] never get big in your own sight. Always
[57:32] realize that you are nothing by the
[57:34] grace of God. And as long as we stay
[57:37] that way, God can do something with us.
[57:39] Now, part of our purpose, friends, some
[57:42] of you feel like, well, I've never done
[57:43] nothing for the Lord. I I I don't have
[57:45] that many people I've led to the Lord. I
[57:48] don't know of any people I prayed for
[57:49] and God's opened their blinded eyes. I
[57:52] don't know of any people that I prayed
[57:53] for with cancer. And you think your life
[57:56] is pretty much, you know, what am I
[57:57] going to get a reward for? Well, part of
[57:59] it will being a great professor in the
[58:02] school, not of Scientology. It will not
[58:05] be of the suit of mechanical science or
[58:08] this or that or the other. It will be as
[58:10] a daughter of God who was called by
[58:13] predestinated unmmerited grace. and you
[58:16] let Jesus sanctify you and cleanse you
[58:19] and fill you with the Holy Ghost. And he
[58:21] got rid of that mini skirt of yours and
[58:23] put you in a decent set of clothes. And
[58:26] he filled you with the Holy Ghost and
[58:28] made you a daughter of God. And then you
[58:30] started living a life on this earth. And
[58:34] the angels of God, note, are not just
[58:36] watching preachers, but they're watching
[58:38] you brothers. They're watching you
[58:40] sisters. The angels of God are watching
[58:43] you young people and learning how a
[58:46] young person in 2025
[58:49] withstands all the drawing power of the
[58:52] social media. The angels of God are
[58:55] learning things. Listen young people,
[58:57] the angels of God are learning things
[59:00] about this generation of young people
[59:03] that the first century young people
[59:05] could not treat them. They could not
[59:07] help them to understand. They did not
[59:10] have social media. They did not have all
[59:13] these things that you all have to battle
[59:15] every day of your life. And God is, oh,
[59:18] hallelujah, implementing grace and mercy
[59:21] out of the life of our young sisters and
[59:24] our young brothers in a way that those
[59:26] first century young people, they
[59:28] wouldn't even understand what you were
[59:30] talking about. And you think, I haven't
[59:32] done anything. Let your life live out
[59:36] the power of God on display. If you're
[59:39] living a life in this day by the grace
[59:42] of God, but brother Donnie, I I'm I'm
[59:44] not perfect. Well, I'm not either. I'm
[59:47] not without fault. I'm not either. But
[59:50] even whenever I'm that way, I'm still
[59:52] living a life by the grace of God. I'm
[59:55] testifying that whenever I'm faithful
[59:57] and I do everything I'm supposed to do,
[59:59] he's there with me. And I'll also
[1:00:02] testify if I fall flat on the face or if
[1:00:04] I get weary, I get down sometime.
[1:00:07] Anybody do that? That he's right there
[1:00:09] with me just as well when I'm in the
[1:00:11] valley as he is in the in the on the
[1:00:14] mountaintop. And the angels of God watch
[1:00:16] us as we go up and down and they say,
[1:00:19] "Look at the grace of God. He has moved
[1:00:21] for them so many times and done so many
[1:00:25] things and now they are so low and
[1:00:27] they're saying, "Where is he? Lord,
[1:00:30] don't you even love me?" And the angels
[1:00:32] looking at one another's thinking, "How
[1:00:33] can they say that? How can they How can
[1:00:36] that even go through their mind? Oh, he
[1:00:38] he he won't fool with them now. He won't
[1:00:40] fool with them now. And then what do
[1:00:42] they watch? They watch him come right on
[1:00:44] the scene. I don't know about you, some
[1:00:46] of the greatest manifestations of grace
[1:00:48] I ever received in my life was when I
[1:00:51] did not deserve it.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; When things you know that you wind up
[1:00:55] doing or whatever and you think, man, I
[1:00:58] know better than that. I knew better
[1:01:00] than that. I I should have acted that
[1:01:01] way or done that, whatever it is. And
[1:01:03] you realize, Lord, I'm not even
[1:01:05] deserving of your grace. He said, I know
[1:01:07] that, but here you are anyway, cuz I
[1:01:09] love you. And the angels of God are
[1:01:11] thinking, you're kidding me. Look at
[1:01:12] that. Did you see that? Did you see what
[1:01:15] he did? Oh my. They were questioning
[1:01:17] him. They were wondering, "Does he even
[1:01:19] love them anymore?" They're questioning
[1:01:21] his decision. They're questioning why
[1:01:23] did he allow that to happen and that to
[1:01:25] happen? Did he forsake them? No. He
[1:01:27] anointed them men of God and they left
[1:01:30] their subject matter for three lines and
[1:01:32] it went right to that person's heart.
[1:01:34] And then they left this subject matter
[1:01:35] for that person and it come back. That's
[1:01:37] what I love about the Lord. I hear it
[1:01:39] all the time. Email, text, and all that
[1:01:40] sort of thing. And people say, "That
[1:01:42] service was just for me." And I smile
[1:01:44] cuz I know I'm going to get several
[1:01:46] hundred more probably. It's going to say
[1:01:48] the same thing. But that's the kind of
[1:01:50] father we have that he can so Oh my
[1:01:53] anoint servant of God to preach the
[1:01:56] word. and you're convinced that whole
[1:01:58] sermon was just for you. And there's
[1:02:00] several other hundred people in the
[1:02:02] church and several other hundred that
[1:02:04] are streaming the service and they're
[1:02:06] saying the same thing. That's my daddy.
[1:02:09] That's your heavenly father. That's the
[1:02:11] way he does. He can custom fit it in
[1:02:14] such a way he wants to make each one of
[1:02:17] his children feel they are so special.
[1:02:21] He would have brother Daryl study for
[1:02:23] hours and hours just for you. And you're
[1:02:28] totally convinced brother Daryl didn't
[1:02:29] preach that for nobody else. And there's
[1:02:31] somebody else sitting right by you.
[1:02:32] Sometimes your husband or your wife are
[1:02:34] on the end of the pew and they're
[1:02:35] saying, "Oh God, thank you for having
[1:02:37] Brother Daryl to preach that just for
[1:02:38] me." No doubt the angels must look over
[1:02:40] one another and say, "Wow.
[1:02:43] Wow. Can you believe that? They all
[1:02:44] think that's just for them." Well, it
[1:02:46] was just for them. It was just for them
[1:02:49] because the Lord is that mindful of his
[1:02:52] children.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Now watch. So the church becomes the
[1:02:58] University of grace.
[1:03:02] ETSU thinks they're the main school here
[1:03:05] in Johnson City.
[1:03:08] Oh, we could share a few things with
[1:03:10] them, couldn't we?
[1:03:11] I've been by the ETSU lots of times of
[1:03:14] course through the years we've lived
[1:03:15] here and from some of the looks of the
[1:03:17] people that I've seen there. I'm not
[1:03:19] sure the angels of God and want to be
[1:03:21] identified in that place. I I don't say
[1:03:23] they ain't angels there but I'm pointing
[1:03:25] up this way. Now you think then so each
[1:03:29] one of you are a professor.
[1:03:33] But brother Dia I I I can't harden quote
[1:03:35] 10 scriptures together. No, not a
[1:03:38] professor by your mind. a professor by
[1:03:41] your experience of the predestinated
[1:03:44] grace in your soul in your everyday walk
[1:03:50] with God. Now what? So God chose to
[1:03:53] manifest these attributes of his
[1:03:56] perfection which of course started in
[1:03:59] the change between the ages by the
[1:04:01] incarnation of the redeemer. So if the
[1:04:05] redeemer had to be incarnated in the
[1:04:09] work of this great emancipation then no
[1:04:12] doubt the redeemed will also have to
[1:04:16] come out through the same process. So he
[1:04:19] come from the very mind of God and took
[1:04:21] on a human body which is exactly what
[1:04:24] happened to us. So God chose the work of
[1:04:28] redemption. I think the work of
[1:04:31] redemption, not the work of signs and
[1:04:34] wonders. And we believe in all that. Not
[1:04:36] the work of stars. Don't you love the
[1:04:38] stars? I love the stars. But God never
[1:04:40] chose that in order to display the
[1:04:44] perfection of his grace. He had to
[1:04:47] ordain predestinate a man that would
[1:04:50] require salvation in order to give
[1:04:53] himself a reason and purpose of being.
[1:04:58] Well, I don't mind telling you. I guess
[1:04:59] I've given him a lot of reason.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Well, come on. Don't sit there and look
[1:05:03] at me. Some of y'all have, too. We've
[1:05:05] given him a lot of reason. A We We've
[1:05:07] given him a lot of purpose to live. If
[1:05:10] he needed to live for somebody, I reckon
[1:05:12] I've surely fulfilled that. Now, he
[1:05:14] could display an element of his
[1:05:17] perfections. And I say that in in plural
[1:05:19] form, because of his greatness. Now,
[1:05:22] think of it that the stars could never
[1:05:24] bring out of him. the plant life could
[1:05:27] never bring out of it. So, as each child
[1:05:30] of God is being conformed into the image
[1:05:33] of the Lord Jesus and every one of their
[1:05:36] walks is a little bit different, your
[1:05:38] little quirks and and your little, you
[1:05:40] know, the things that you have in your
[1:05:41] life. And God deals with each one of us
[1:05:43] and we say, "I just wish was all alike."
[1:05:46] He don't want us to be all alike. So,
[1:05:48] there's something that you would be able
[1:05:50] to bring out about the perfection of
[1:05:53] God's grace that I wouldn't if you would
[1:05:56] and you would and you would. And each
[1:05:58] one of us as we come into that image,
[1:06:00] all of us with the scars and the issues
[1:06:03] of our past and the things that we hate
[1:06:05] and yet God says, "Give it all to me.
[1:06:11] Let's put it all together.
[1:06:18] So,
[1:06:21] there was a church
[1:06:24] that was going to have a Sunday school
[1:06:26] picnic
[1:06:29] and they gave the announcement of this
[1:06:30] certain day that they're going to have
[1:06:32] it. And everybody, of course, a Sunday
[1:06:35] school, you know, they wanted to come to
[1:06:36] the church picnic. But there was this
[1:06:39] poor family in the church.
[1:06:42] And when it come the day for the picnic,
[1:06:44] the only thing they had left in the
[1:06:46] house
[1:06:48] was a few pieces of baloney
[1:06:51] and a few pieces of half stale bread.
[1:06:55] They like mustard on their baloney
[1:06:57] sandwich,
[1:06:59] but the mustard was so low
[1:07:02] that when they reached the knife down in
[1:07:04] the jar, they got mustard all over their
[1:07:06] knuckles trying to get it out.
[1:07:09] So, they're scraping the bottom of the
[1:07:12] jar,
[1:07:14] but they decide they're going anyway.
[1:07:17] So, they get to the park where the
[1:07:19] picnic is going to be.
[1:07:25] The only place left to set was at a
[1:07:29] table
[1:07:31] by the church's best cook.
[1:07:36] And this sister and her husband and
[1:07:38] children,
[1:07:40] she had fixed southern fried chicken,
[1:07:44] mashed potatoes and gravy,
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; carrots, peas,
[1:07:50] dinner rolls,
[1:07:52] and a big southern deep baked
[1:07:56] apple pie for dessert.
[1:08:02] And they looked over at that poor family
[1:08:06] and they said, "Why don't I've got more
[1:08:08] than what we we can eat. Why don't y'all
[1:08:10] eat with us?" And they said, "No, no,
[1:08:12] no. We we we going to do it. We're we're
[1:08:14] okay."
[1:08:16] But they felt so sorryful.
[1:08:21] So the mother said, "You know what? We
[1:08:24] love bologoney sandwiches.
[1:08:27] Why don't we
[1:08:30] Why don't we just mix it all together?
[1:08:37] You see, they didn't want their bone
[1:08:39] sandwiches,
[1:08:41] but they wanted them to have their
[1:08:44] chicken.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus don't need our bologoney.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; He don't need our little last few drops
[1:08:53] of mustard,
[1:08:55] but he wants us to have his chicken. his
[1:08:59] potatoes, his carrots, his peas, his
[1:09:02] apple thigh, his dinner rose.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; So what does he do? He said, "Y'all just
[1:09:08] mix what you've got
[1:09:11] with me.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; You take your complexes, your fears, and
[1:09:16] your anxieties,
[1:09:18] and mix them in with my grace.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Mix them in with my mercy."
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; G
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; and look at what it will produce.
[1:09:27] Hallelujah.
[1:09:28] It produces a university that the angels
[1:09:33] of God look at
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; and ponder.
[1:09:37] But what makes it the mixture
[1:09:41] of the divine with the human?
[1:09:48] You imagine, let me read you this.
[1:09:52] As the angels of God watched
[1:09:56] as our sister,
[1:09:58] one of the early martyrs by the name of
[1:10:00] Blandina,
[1:10:03] who was made to sit in a red hot chair
[1:10:09] after having been tossed upon the horns
[1:10:13] of a wild bull.
[1:10:18] Yet constant to the last, she maintained
[1:10:22] her faith in Christ
[1:10:24] while passing through
[1:10:27] the torture.
[1:10:30] So you imagine they throw her into the
[1:10:32] horns of a bull,
[1:10:34] then they take her off of that and heat
[1:10:38] up a metal chair red hot and set our
[1:10:42] sister in that.
[1:10:46] I'll tell you one thing. Some of this
[1:10:48] stuff makes us ashamed of ourselves,
[1:10:49] don't it?
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; You imagine the angels of God as they
[1:10:54] look now. She may have never won one
[1:10:56] soul to the Lord Jesus.
[1:10:59] No doubt never preach one sermon,
[1:11:03] but there was part of her life that
[1:11:05] contributed
[1:11:07] to the great mystery. God has a purpose
[1:11:11] to convey to the angels. Don't you see
[1:11:13] how important that is to him? It's not
[1:11:15] just to prove to you he's a savior. He
[1:11:18] wants them to see it.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; They have been around for aons of ages,
[1:11:25] but there's much about him they don't
[1:11:28] understand yet.
[1:11:31] And he's using the university of saved
[1:11:35] saints.
[1:11:42] Imagine every day they don't get tired,
[1:11:43] so they don't go to bed at night. But
[1:11:45] you imagine every day they're thinking,
[1:11:47] "What are we learning today?
[1:11:51] What are we learning today? What what's
[1:11:52] God going to do through Fred? What's God
[1:11:55] going to do through Jim? What's God
[1:11:56] going to do through Carol? What what's
[1:11:58] God going to do every day? It's a new
[1:11:59] day. It's a new journey. Just see how he
[1:12:02] saves him and how he forgives him and
[1:12:04] how how he does all this stuff." And you
[1:12:06] know, when they're coming up, I say,
[1:12:08] "What'd you learn today?" When I I was
[1:12:10] over in Africa, Nigeria. Where was you?
[1:12:13] I was in the Congo. Where was you? I was
[1:12:14] in Switzerland. I was in Spain. I was in
[1:12:16] England. I was in Tennessee. I I was in
[1:12:18] Ohio. I was in Indiana. You imagine
[1:12:19] coming together said, "What'd you learn
[1:12:21] today?" You can't believe it. You can't
[1:12:23] believe it. I've been by his side for
[1:12:26] millions of years. Can you believe it?
[1:12:29] I've been by his side for millions of
[1:12:31] years. And there's things I learned
[1:12:33] about him today
[1:12:35] through one of his weakest Christians
[1:12:38] that I have never known.
[1:12:42] And I was spellbound
[1:12:45] as I watched it.
[1:12:53] 1 Corinthians chapter 4:9 Paul says,
[1:12:57] "I think that God has set forth
[1:13:00] us the apostles last
[1:13:03] as it were appointed to death.
[1:13:08] For we are made a spectacle
[1:13:12] unto the world
[1:13:14] and to angels
[1:13:17] and to men."
[1:13:20] Look at the word spectacle.
[1:13:23] Theatron,
[1:13:25] a theater,
[1:13:27] a place in which games and dramatic
[1:13:31] spectacles are exhibited
[1:13:35] and public assemblies held for the
[1:13:37] Greeks use the theater also as a forum,
[1:13:41] a public show.
[1:13:43] metaphorically a man who is exhibited to
[1:13:47] be gazed at and made sport of.
[1:13:54] Now notice the categories that Paul
[1:13:56] mentioned unto the world to angels and
[1:14:00] to men. Unto the world unto angels and
[1:14:04] to men. Wonder what each group saw?
[1:14:07] Well, it depends on who they were.
[1:14:10] what they saw would be determined by
[1:14:13] their origination.
[1:14:15] So the angels of God took it as a
[1:14:18] complete understanding of God's mercy
[1:14:22] through Paul. God's grace through Peter,
[1:14:24] both of them so different and both of
[1:14:26] them still needed grace. Matthew
[1:14:29] different from the rest of them and John
[1:14:31] different from all of them yet. And
[1:14:32] every one of them was a part of the
[1:14:35] theater. So, it's a story of redemption,
[1:14:38] a great mystery that the great almighty
[1:14:40] did in his drama before the foundation
[1:14:42] of the world. And the little housewife
[1:14:44] comes out and plays her part in the
[1:14:45] drama. And the farmer comes out and
[1:14:47] plays his. And the businessman comes out
[1:14:50] and plays his. And the witch and the
[1:14:52] poor and the middle and the in between.
[1:14:53] All of them come out and they're on the
[1:14:55] theater stage at the same time in the
[1:14:57] age they live. And each one of them
[1:15:00] acting it. What is it? Divine
[1:15:02] orchestration by the Almighty. And we
[1:15:05] think, "Oh, well, I'm just living my
[1:15:06] life and I don't really have no effect
[1:15:08] on nobody." Are you kidding me? You are
[1:15:12] affecting other worlds.
[1:15:18] [Music]
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; They look at the church
[1:15:27] to understand the mysteries
[1:15:31] of redemption.
[1:15:34] Wow. I imagine this one took Rebecca
[1:15:37] maybe a couple of days for Eleazar
[1:15:39] trying to go back over a couple
[1:15:41] Wednesday nights, you know, where she
[1:15:42] could kind of pick it up.
[1:15:46] First Peter 1:12. unto whom it was
[1:15:49] revealed that not unto themselves, but
[1:15:51] unto us, they did minister the things
[1:15:54] which are now reported unto you, by them
[1:15:57] that have preached the gospel unto you,
[1:15:59] with the Holy Ghost, sent down from
[1:16:01] heaven, which things the angels desire
[1:16:07] to look
[1:16:11] to look into.
[1:16:14] Look at the word Luke. Look,
[1:16:17] stoop down.
[1:16:22] So, they're actually getting down.
[1:16:26] Oh my goodness.
[1:16:31] Wow.
[1:16:33] You know how many threads is in that in
[1:16:35] one square inch?
[1:16:37] No. You just tread on top that carpet.
[1:16:39] You don't pay no attention, do you? Do
[1:16:40] you? But the angels are so interested
[1:16:44] that they're looking down. Oh my
[1:16:47] goodness.
[1:16:49] You mean God will breed a man to a woman
[1:16:51] and then out of that'll come a woman and
[1:16:53] then out of that that woman will marry
[1:16:55] this man and that man will marry this
[1:16:56] woman and this one and on down and out
[1:16:58] of that maybe seven or eight generations
[1:17:00] he'll come a preacher. He'll start out
[1:17:02] he'll be lost as he can be. He'll wind
[1:17:04] up being a drunk. God will give him,
[1:17:05] save him, fill him with the Holy Ghost
[1:17:07] and that man will send a million souls
[1:17:09] to Christ. And the angels of God say,
[1:17:11] "Wow."
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; And you're down, you're on the earth
[1:17:15] looking up at Pluto and saying, "Wow."
[1:17:19] And you're looking around say, "Whoops,
[1:17:20] that's the wrong one. That's Saturn."
[1:17:22] Oh, I'm sorry. No. Okay. We're Oh, yo.
[1:17:25] Wow. Look at that. And the angels of God
[1:17:27] are looking down and you say, "Wow.
[1:17:31] Wow. Look at the grace of God. Look at
[1:17:33] the mercy of God. Day in day out, 24/7.
[1:17:37] He's given them grace when they're
[1:17:38] asleep. He's given them grace when
[1:17:40] they're up. He's given them grace when
[1:17:42] they're down. He's given them mercy when
[1:17:44] they don't deserve it. Given them mercy
[1:17:45] when they feel like there's no none at
[1:17:47] all. Hey, he helps them. He gives them
[1:17:49] faith when they're super strong. He
[1:17:51] gives them hope when they're super weak.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Listen, this word that Peter used
[1:17:59] remember this is from an ignorant and an
[1:18:01] unlearned man.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; To stoop to a thing. to stoop to a thing
[1:18:12] in order to look at it. So, it's like
[1:18:15] you can't comprehend it at this level.
[1:18:20] I'm going to investigate this plant
[1:18:22] here. Yeah, just what I figured.
[1:18:25] Plastic.
[1:18:33] Brother Donnie, what are you looking
[1:18:34] for? Made in China label.
[1:18:40] But I've got a stoop.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; The angels of God are not way up here.
[1:18:45] So apart from your world, they're right
[1:18:47] here in this building tonight. They rode
[1:18:49] to church with you. They was with you on
[1:18:51] your job today.
[1:18:54] Hallelujah.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; And they stood up.
[1:19:00] Oh,
[1:19:02] boy. I thought he was a goner, didn't
[1:19:04] you?
[1:19:06] Wow,
[1:19:08] that is amazing.
[1:19:12] I want you to look at that.
[1:19:15] Oh,
[1:19:17] I never knew that before today
[1:19:21] that God could do such.
[1:19:27] How many ever we all go to sleep? They
[1:19:28] gather up and say, "Wow,
[1:19:31] what a time I had today.
[1:19:34] Man, what a time I had. I was down there
[1:19:37] ministering to those who were heirs of
[1:19:39] life.
[1:19:41] I was in church on Wednesday night
[1:19:43] standing there in the aisle by those
[1:19:45] that were sick. And there was a war
[1:19:47] going on. It was raging. The angels of
[1:19:50] God was there and the demons of darkness
[1:19:53] was there. And I was trying to pulsate
[1:19:55] their faith, trying to create an
[1:19:57] atmosphere to pull them in. Did it
[1:20:00] happen? Did it happen? Yes. It was
[1:20:02] amazing. They walked in there with such
[1:20:04] burdens and such load and they didn't
[1:20:06] have no idea what they was going to do.
[1:20:08] And the the presence of Almighty come in
[1:20:10] there. This one was healed of sinus.
[1:20:12] This one was delivered of that. This one
[1:20:14] was delivered of pornography. This one
[1:20:16] was delivered of something else. Oh wow.
[1:20:26] to look carefully,
[1:20:29] inspect
[1:20:32] curiously
[1:20:36] of one who would become acquainted
[1:20:40] with something.
[1:20:43] Now, do you realize that the angels were
[1:20:46] actually part of God giving the law
[1:20:50] to Israel?
[1:20:55] Acts 7:53
[1:20:58] who have received the law
[1:21:01] by the disposition of angels
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; and have not kept it. Now this is
[1:21:06] Stephen preaching to the his brethren
[1:21:08] there. So the law came through the
[1:21:10] disposition of angels.
[1:21:13] Galatians 3:19. Wherefore then serve as
[1:21:16] the law? It was added because of
[1:21:19] transgression till the seed was made and
[1:21:23] it was ordained
[1:21:27] by angels
[1:21:30] in the hand of a mediator.
[1:21:35] Look at the word ordained. Don't mean
[1:21:36] what you think here.
[1:21:39] the tesso appoint set in order to
[1:21:43] arrange
[1:21:45] prescribe
[1:21:47] or give order.
[1:21:50] Isn't it amazing though that whenever
[1:21:52] Moses writes about the law being
[1:21:54] revealed, the Torah, when it came there
[1:21:56] on the mount, he doesn't say nothing
[1:21:59] about angels.
[1:22:02] He mentions himself
[1:22:04] and the presence of God,
[1:22:07] but actually it was coming through the
[1:22:09] divine way. The angels of God were there
[1:22:13] and they were so concerned about what
[1:22:16] God was doing. Well, what are you doing?
[1:22:18] What are you do? Come on, go with me.
[1:22:21] So here he come down on the mountain and
[1:22:23] the roar of the thunder and the
[1:22:25] lightning and the rumbling and all that
[1:22:27] stuff and hid in the clouds was angels.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Ah God still does that, don't he?
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; So now notice when God sends a company
[1:22:42] of angels with a message,
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; it's not just church as usual. That's
[1:22:48] right.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. When God sends angels,
[1:22:54] heaven and earth is having quite a time
[1:22:58] together.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Now, what does the angelic presence do?
[1:23:03] It gives it a heavenly identification
[1:23:06] just beyond a man going up there. Now,
[1:23:08] for those of you that are curious, I
[1:23:10] could not find anywhere on Google to
[1:23:12] where Google could actually prove that
[1:23:14] this really happened. I couldn't find on
[1:23:17] YouTube or any scientist or any
[1:23:18] university uh could actually prove
[1:23:20] scientifically that God ever wrote the
[1:23:23] Ten Commandments by his finger or that
[1:23:25] Moses said it. So, I'm preaching it
[1:23:27] tonight. Uh taking it just from one
[1:23:29] man's word.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Entirely up to you, of course, whether
[1:23:34] you want to believe that one man or not,
[1:23:35] but I I choose to myself. I personally
[1:23:38] don't need Google verification. I don't
[1:23:41] need YouTube verification. I don't need
[1:23:44] Louisville newspaper verification. Come
[1:23:46] on, somebody. Because I believe my God
[1:23:50] has done in this generation what he has
[1:23:53] done down through the ages. And that is
[1:23:55] send down his angels to verify I am here
[1:24:00] to do something great and phenomenal.
[1:24:03] And he brings angels when he does it.
[1:24:08] Sir,
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; you see these passages prove to us that
[1:24:12] the angels were involved in the
[1:24:16] communication and the divine allotment
[1:24:19] of this word. Lord have mercy. So the
[1:24:22] angels did not watch from a far off.
[1:24:26] They were part of the ordination
[1:24:32] participants
[1:24:34] in bringing God's glory.
[1:24:37] Their presence emphasize the sanctity
[1:24:40] and the divinity as well.
[1:24:44] This is the truth.
[1:24:50] Its origin is sacred and divine.
[1:24:56] So you imagine
[1:24:58] as a prophet is in a little cabin
[1:25:00] praying
[1:25:02] and he feels his presence walk into the
[1:25:04] room where he is and he opens up his
[1:25:07] eyes and there's two feet in front of
[1:25:10] him and he goes rolling his eyes up.
[1:25:14] What was it? An angel of God. I am sent
[1:25:19] from the presence of almighty God to
[1:25:22] tell you of your peculiar births and
[1:25:24] your ministry.
[1:25:26] Hallelujah. When God sends an angel,
[1:25:30] something's fixing to happen. It's
[1:25:32] beyond what happened, my friends, on on
[1:25:34] the Zusa Street, it's beyond what
[1:25:36] happened when Luther marked the 95
[1:25:38] thesis on the door of the church at
[1:25:40] Wittenberg. It's beyond all of that. Now
[1:25:42] you're climbing into a higher sphere.
[1:25:45] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:25:48] Oh, then what about when seven angels
[1:25:50] come down? Amen. And they brought down a
[1:25:54] message in the end time. And remember
[1:25:55] the prophet tells us that he broke the
[1:25:57] seal. Each angel came each day. Now he
[1:26:00] never told that to the right to the end
[1:26:01] of it. Each angel came each day to
[1:26:04] reveal the mystery that was made known
[1:26:07] only unto them.
[1:26:11] Now remember when God gave Moses the
[1:26:14] instructions on building the tabernacle
[1:26:18] in the wilderness. Now would you notice
[1:26:20] how that God types
[1:26:23] of where he is versus where his people
[1:26:25] are when God told them to build this
[1:26:29] tabernacle.
[1:26:31] They were not living in permanent
[1:26:33] houses.
[1:26:34] They were living in tents.
[1:26:37] So what did God tell them to build for
[1:26:40] him? A tent.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; And what did God tell them to call that
[1:26:46] tent? The tabernacle of the
[1:26:49] congregation.
[1:26:51] So the place of worship bore the name of
[1:26:56] the people who were worshiping.
[1:26:59] The tabernacle of the congregation. When
[1:27:03] the children of Israel moved into homes
[1:27:05] with foundations, then God allowed
[1:27:08] Solomon to build a temple with massive
[1:27:12] foundations. Why? His people moved out
[1:27:15] of tents into a house. And God said,
[1:27:18] "I'll follow the move of my people. My
[1:27:22] people have moved into houses with
[1:27:25] foundations. I'll move into a house with
[1:27:28] a foundation." Well, glory to God. Don't
[1:27:31] you understand why he must become a
[1:27:34] human being? You come from the mind of
[1:27:37] God as a thought of God and you moved
[1:27:39] into a human tabernacle. He must follow
[1:27:43] your move. Oh, but glory to God, as the
[1:27:47] head was raised up from the grave, now
[1:27:50] the bride is going to follow the move of
[1:27:53] the bridegroom. He moved into a
[1:27:56] glorified body. And before long, we're
[1:27:59] fixing to move into the same.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There's God's
[1:28:05] place of worship.
[1:28:08] [Applause]
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? Angels, angels
[1:28:15] who you and I would be terrified
[1:28:19] in their presence.
[1:28:22] If an angel of God were to walk right in
[1:28:24] this room, I've seen a few.
[1:28:27] They scare you to death. You imagine
[1:28:30] brother Brandon saying every time he
[1:28:31] come into his presence, Brother Bisc
[1:28:33] told me of several different events when
[1:28:35] it happened there to him. It was just
[1:28:36] phenomenal. Brother Brandon would become
[1:28:38] ash and white. His lips go numb.
[1:28:41] Couldn't hardly talk. Just amazing to
[1:28:43] hear the things that that he would
[1:28:44] happen when he get into that realm. And
[1:28:46] when he come out, he said, "Brother,
[1:28:47] brother brother Eddie, it's happened
[1:28:49] thousands of times, but it alarms me
[1:28:52] every time it happens." And as they
[1:28:54] would appear in this building tonight,
[1:28:56] probably most of us would get be down on
[1:28:58] our knees in our face and oh God, oh
[1:29:00] God, help us tonight. Lord, be merciful
[1:29:03] to us. And those beings are studying
[1:29:06] your life, reading from the university
[1:29:10] of the divine alotment of God's word
[1:29:13] that he's working out in your daily
[1:29:15] routine,
[1:29:16] dealing with your teenage children,
[1:29:18] dealing with a husband that's not where
[1:29:20] he needs to be with God or dealing with
[1:29:22] an issue in your church, an issue in
[1:29:24] your family, and the angels of God
[1:29:26] observing. How will they deal with this?
[1:29:28] How will they handle this?
[1:29:32] And each one of you are a professor.
[1:29:37] Now, most of you are like me. You don't
[1:29:39] even speak English very well.
[1:29:43] Much less angelic talk.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; But you see, it's not coming through our
[1:29:48] head. It's what God does through our
[1:29:51] life.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Because our own brains would talk us out
[1:29:55] of many of the things that we have done
[1:29:57] for the Lord Jesus.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Can I go a bit further?
[1:30:02] Now remember when God gave them the
[1:30:05] mercy seat and he gives them the divine
[1:30:08] dimensions the wood that it's made of
[1:30:11] how it's to be overlaid in gold in case
[1:30:12] you would of course close your team wood
[1:30:14] was part of it and then it's going to be
[1:30:16] overlaid with gold. So the wood
[1:30:17] represented the humanity and then it was
[1:30:19] overlaid with the gold and there the
[1:30:21] glory of God was inside of there was a
[1:30:24] pot of mana and also the other articles
[1:30:26] that God put. Now there was two peculiar
[1:30:29] figures
[1:30:32] that were right on top of the lid
[1:30:35] cherubims.
[1:30:39] And their direction and their posture
[1:30:42] was so important.
[1:30:45] And it was like this.
[1:30:47] They faced each other
[1:30:51] and their heads were bowed down.
[1:30:57] So they're not looking at each other.
[1:30:59] They're not looking at the preachers
[1:31:00] coming and going. They're not looking at
[1:31:02] singers,
[1:31:03] but their eyes are toward the mercy
[1:31:06] seat.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; God foreshadowed
[1:31:10] that one day the angels of God after the
[1:31:13] coming of the Holy Ghost will still bow
[1:31:16] their heads down to the earth and look
[1:31:21] and comprehend the mercy. Could you
[1:31:24] imagine them wondering how could a piece
[1:31:26] of wood how could what what's what's he
[1:31:29] saying? What's what's he getting? So
[1:31:33] place them like this, Moses.
[1:31:35] And their heads bowed down
[1:31:38] to look like that. Okay Lord, whatever
[1:31:42] you say, you're the man. You're the
[1:31:44] designer. You're the director. I'm the
[1:31:46] just the builder. You tell me to turn
[1:31:47] them sideways, upside down. Whatever you
[1:31:49] say, you know what you're doing. I'll do
[1:31:50] whatever you want me to do. And you
[1:31:52] imagine when the high priest would walk
[1:31:54] in there, the only ones that are even
[1:31:55] able to see it, and they look at, what
[1:31:58] does that mean?
[1:32:01] Why would their heads be down? Why would
[1:32:05] they be looking up this way toward him?
[1:32:09] Cuz they were looking toward him in his
[1:32:12] earthly
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; manifestation of where his grace was.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Now, friend, this is the this is the sad
[1:32:20] part about it. The angels of God are on
[1:32:23] the earth and the mercy seat on the
[1:32:25] earth is in the heart of the bride. Oh
[1:32:28] my God, brother Daryl, what a day it's
[1:32:30] going to be whenever the the darkness
[1:32:32] will finally come and the last one will
[1:32:33] be saved and God will lift those
[1:32:36] cherubims and God will take the mercy
[1:32:38] seat from the earth. As long as their
[1:32:41] heads are bowed,
[1:32:43] there's still mercy. That's grace.
[1:32:47] But once they turn heavenly,
[1:32:50] do you understand when that will be?
[1:32:52] When they turn from your heart and you
[1:32:56] will turn heavenly.
[1:33:00] Do you understand all the rioting and
[1:33:02] all the violence and all the stuff that
[1:33:04] we're seeing? Whoever is do y'all can
[1:33:06] y'all believe we're living in America?
[1:33:08] All this stuff that's going on around
[1:33:09] our nation. I've been listening today to
[1:33:12] God of this evil age. And the prophet
[1:33:14] used the word two, three times there,
[1:33:16] lawlessness.
[1:33:18] Lawlessness. I've been seeing it in and
[1:33:21] news articles and and seeing it on news
[1:33:23] clips on YouTube and they've been using
[1:33:25] the same word. I thought, I know I've
[1:33:27] heard brother Ram say that. So, I pulled
[1:33:28] it up last night and then I listened to
[1:33:30] the tape today and he was saying it two
[1:33:32] or three different times. Lawlessness.
[1:33:34] Lawless. What is it? Oh, friends, it is
[1:33:37] the pre-tribulation
[1:33:39] anointing. The nations of the earth have
[1:33:43] already prematurely joined themselves
[1:33:46] against Israel.
[1:33:48] Come on, don't get quiet on me. Look at
[1:33:51] the UN. Look at the nations of the
[1:33:53] world. Look at France. Look at Germany.
[1:33:55] Look at the UK. And they are supposed to
[1:33:57] be some of our greatest allies. And yet
[1:34:00] wanting to announce, announce, and
[1:34:03] recognize a Palestinian state. There's
[1:34:06] one state that God recognizes over there
[1:34:08] and it's not the state of Palestine. It
[1:34:11] is Israel.
[1:34:13] It is Israel. And the world is gathering
[1:34:17] themselves against them. That's the
[1:34:20] mechanics. What's it waiting for? You to
[1:34:23] go home. But remember, we can't go until
[1:34:26] you see who you are. I wonder if things
[1:34:29] like this
[1:34:32] will help us to look where instead of
[1:34:36] looking outward,
[1:34:38] looking inward.
[1:34:44] Who is this?
[1:34:47] Who is in us?
[1:34:49] What is he doing?
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's just Brother Greg. It's just
[1:34:57] Brother Fred. It's just Brother Kirk. I
[1:34:59] go to church him all the time.
[1:35:02] And the angels of God are studying you
[1:35:06] looking at your life
[1:35:09] just shaking their head.
[1:35:11] Wow.
[1:35:14] I'll tell you that that book of JD that
[1:35:16] that's an awesome book. I love reading
[1:35:18] that. That man is a professor. Do you
[1:35:20] know that that Larry Elliott you talking
[1:35:23] about a professor now? And not because
[1:35:25] Belari uses big words.
[1:35:29] It's the grace of God.
[1:35:32] The cherubims
[1:35:34] anchored over the soul
[1:35:38] watching the sacred
[1:35:41] treasure
[1:35:44] of Adonai.
[1:35:47] For the secret is no longer in the heart
[1:35:50] of God,
[1:35:54] but in the heart of his wife.
[1:36:07] So our lives are linked
[1:36:10] connected
[1:36:13] to other worlds.
[1:36:16] And what happens to us
[1:36:18] has bearings
[1:36:21] in angelic realms.
[1:36:26] Read with me in the book of Judges
[1:36:28] 13:15.
[1:36:30] This is the time of the judges. And
[1:36:32] Manoah said unto the angel of the Lord,
[1:36:35] I pray thee, let us detain thee until we
[1:36:39] shall have made ready a kid for thee.
[1:36:42] And the angel of the Lord said unto
[1:36:43] Monoah, "Though thou detain me, I will
[1:36:46] not eat of thy bread. And if thou will
[1:36:48] offer a burnt offering, thou must offer
[1:36:49] it unto the Lord." Yeah, that's true
[1:36:52] messenger. All right. For Monoah knew
[1:36:55] not that he was an angel of the Lord.
[1:37:00] So he had appeared in such humanlike
[1:37:04] characteristics.
[1:37:06] So there wasn't brilliant rays of light
[1:37:10] coming from him. So he's looking right
[1:37:12] at him talking to him and he doesn't
[1:37:14] know that it's an angel of the Lord. Now
[1:37:16] this is a great transition time of the
[1:37:19] judges and God has a message
[1:37:23] and he sends an angel.
[1:37:27] And Monoah said unto the angel of the
[1:37:29] Lord,
[1:37:31] what is thy name
[1:37:34] when thy sayings come to pass that we
[1:37:36] may do thee honor? The angel of the Lord
[1:37:40] said unto him,"Wh askest thou thus after
[1:37:44] my name,
[1:37:46] seeing it is a secret."
[1:37:49] So Monoah took a kid with a meat
[1:37:51] offering and offered it upon a rock unto
[1:37:53] the Lord. And the angel did wondrously.
[1:38:00] And Monoah and his wife looked on.
[1:38:04] For it came to pass, and the flame went
[1:38:07] up toward heaven from off the altar,
[1:38:09] that the angel of the Lord ascended in
[1:38:12] the flame of the altar, and Monoah and
[1:38:16] his wife looked on it and fell on their
[1:38:19] faces
[1:38:21] to the ground.
[1:38:23] Now, this is the Old Testament, but
[1:38:26] after the cross,
[1:38:30] instead of Daryl and Cheryl looking at
[1:38:32] the angels, the angels are watching
[1:38:34] Daryl and Cheryl.
[1:38:38] And the angels are waiting for the day
[1:38:42] when the bride will not enter into the
[1:38:44] fire off the altar,
[1:38:47] but from the token.
[1:38:49] and they will be the ones that will
[1:38:51] arise
[1:38:53] into the presence of Adoniah.
[1:38:59] Let me close. We ain't going to get
[1:39:00] done.
[1:39:02] Luke 15:E 10.
[1:39:05] Likewise, I say unto you,
[1:39:09] there is joy
[1:39:13] in the presence of the angels of God
[1:39:18] over one sinner
[1:39:20] that repenteth. Look at the word joy.
[1:39:24] gladness, joyfulness, the cause or
[1:39:28] occasion of joy of persons
[1:39:32] who are ones joy.
[1:39:38] Now, don't angels have joy before people
[1:39:40] get saved? Well, no doubt they do.
[1:39:43] They're not going around sad, you know,
[1:39:44] just all droopy and all that sort of
[1:39:46] thing. But one sinner coming to an altar
[1:39:49] to give their heart to God whether it's
[1:39:51] in a church or you know wherever it is
[1:39:52] that the Lord deals with her heart and
[1:39:55] that has such a ripple effect
[1:39:58] that angels move into a higher realm of
[1:40:02] a static joy higher than they normally
[1:40:05] live in.
[1:40:09] So it ain't the price of gold. It ain't
[1:40:12] the stock market. Oh converter prices
[1:40:14] have doubled. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:40:16] The angels don't care about interest
[1:40:18] rates. They don't care about the Feds.
[1:40:20] They don't care about none of that
[1:40:21] stuff. But you know what really excites
[1:40:23] them? See folks saved.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. So you imagine that
[1:40:29] the angels now with this gladness,
[1:40:32] joyfulness,
[1:40:34] the cause or occasion
[1:40:37] of joy, the cause or occasion of joy of
[1:40:42] persons who are one's joy. You imagine
[1:40:46] after folks who get saved would have
[1:40:48] just getting saved to do that. Can you
[1:40:50] imagine what the Holy Ghost does to
[1:40:52] them? Lord have mercy. They must have a
[1:40:54] spell. You imagine when the revelation
[1:40:56] of God that Jesus only gave us a small
[1:40:58] window into how that the things on the
[1:41:00] earth are so correlated with the people
[1:41:03] of God to the angelic host just that
[1:41:06] them getting saved gives them joy. Can
[1:41:08] you imagine when a seed of God, their
[1:41:10] eyes is open to the end time word? Or
[1:41:13] when a child of God moves beyond the
[1:41:15] curtain of time and how the angels of
[1:41:18] God are there rejoicing. You say, "Well,
[1:41:20] they're so far apart from us." They are
[1:41:22] not.
[1:41:28] As a matter of fact, question answers on
[1:41:30] Genesis 19:53,
[1:41:32] the prophet said, "Your glorified
[1:41:35] condition
[1:41:38] is right in this building this morning
[1:41:41] wanting to send a charge through you
[1:41:45] like a battery.
[1:41:50] Anybody ever get down pretty low and
[1:41:52] your spiritual engine won't crank?
[1:41:55] [Music]
[1:41:58] Going to church tonight. I can't get
[1:42:00] started.
[1:42:04] Brother, if you can't do nothing but
[1:42:06] push start, come on to the house of God.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; You never know, the angel might stand
[1:42:11] near you tonight, your angel, and take
[1:42:14] them spiritual jumper cables and hook
[1:42:16] them up to you. And then that angel goes
[1:42:20] and you say, "Glory to God. Where is
[1:42:22] that devil? Where is that devil?
[1:42:24] Hallelujah. I can't believe I was down."
[1:42:26] And then the angel said, "Are you
[1:42:28] kidding me? He stood right out there in
[1:42:31] the forer and told somebody if he didn't
[1:42:34] get something tonight, he wasn't coming
[1:42:35] back. This is his lifetime. He's
[1:42:37] quitting church. How many thousands of
[1:42:39] times have some of y'all quit church?
[1:42:41] How many hundreds of times have y'all
[1:42:43] quit? I'm going back to the world. I'm
[1:42:45] doing this. And the angels of God
[1:42:46] laughing at you said, "Right, I've seen
[1:42:49] how he loves you. I've seen how you move
[1:42:51] him. He will not let you go. He will not
[1:42:55] let you go. He will not let you down."
[1:42:58] And then the this presence of God comes
[1:43:01] and shakes you and turns you every way
[1:43:03] but loose. And you're walking out that
[1:43:05] door. And boy, you're a kicking as
[1:43:07] you're going. And the angels are saying,
[1:43:08] "Yes. Yes. I knew it. I knew it. I knew
[1:43:12] he would do it.
[1:43:16] [Applause]
[1:43:30] Matthew 28:2, "And behold, there was a
[1:43:32] great earthquake, for the angel of the
[1:43:34] Lord descended from heaven and came and
[1:43:36] rolled back the stone from the door." I
[1:43:39] love this part right here. And sat upon
[1:43:42] it.
[1:43:45] How you like that, Roman rock?
[1:43:48] His countenance was like lightning. Now
[1:43:51] listen how different this one appeared
[1:43:54] than the one that appeared to Monoah and
[1:43:55] his wife.
[1:43:57] And his countenance was like lightning
[1:43:59] and his rain white as snow.
[1:44:03] And for fear of him the keepers did
[1:44:07] shake
[1:44:09] and became as dead men.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; So apparently this is the kind of
[1:44:15] appearance he needed to appear. Scare
[1:44:17] the liver out of them. Just knock them
[1:44:19] out.
[1:44:21] I got some talking I got to do to my
[1:44:23] children, y'all pass out.
[1:44:27] And the angel answered and said unto the
[1:44:29] women,
[1:44:31] "Fear not ye." Oh, glory to God. How
[1:44:35] could the same appearing of an angel of
[1:44:38] God cause some people to pass out,
[1:44:41] others to wake up?
[1:44:44] Praise
[1:44:45] be to God. Very same angel, very same
[1:44:47] event. And isn't it amazing? He didn't
[1:44:50] tell them other guys, "Don't be afraid."
[1:44:52] I'm gonna be honest with you. He wanted
[1:44:54] them to be.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; But they saw the same thing. And he
[1:44:58] said, "Fear not ye, for I know that you
[1:45:02] seek Jesus which was crucified. He is
[1:45:05] not here for he is risen." As he said,
[1:45:08] "Come, come
[1:45:11] see the place where the Lord lay." Can
[1:45:13] you imagine
[1:45:16] an angel of God is walking along with
[1:45:18] you? And the brilliance of his his
[1:45:21] appearance is so bright you can hardly
[1:45:23] bear. And you're thinking to yourself,
[1:45:24] "What am I doing? I'm walking with an
[1:45:27] angel of God,
[1:45:29] come and see the place where the Lord
[1:45:31] lay. And go quickly and tell his
[1:45:33] disciples that he's risen from the dead.
[1:45:36] And behold, he goeth before you into
[1:45:38] Galilee." Watch him. Prophecy.
[1:45:41] the angels telling them something that's
[1:45:43] going to come to pass. He was allocated
[1:45:46] that word. But remember, he's not a
[1:45:48] preacher.
[1:45:49] There you shall see him. Lo, I have told
[1:45:53] you. And they departed quickly from the
[1:45:55] separate with fear and great joy. That
[1:45:58] sounds like a real church meeting to me,
[1:46:00] don't you? You get scared to death. And
[1:46:02] then after that, the fear of God comes
[1:46:03] and just boy, just lift you so high and
[1:46:05] that fear turns right into joy. Well,
[1:46:07] hallelujah. Wasn't it good to be in the
[1:46:08] house of God? Well, what you experience?
[1:46:11] fear, tears, shaking, shouting, crying.
[1:46:13] Yep, that sounded like a good service to
[1:46:15] me. Move every extreme of your emotions.
[1:46:17] And they departed quickly from the
[1:46:19] separate fear and great joy and did
[1:46:24] wow
[1:46:27] run to bring his disciples where. Acts
[1:46:31] 12:7. And behold, the angel of the Lord
[1:46:34] came upon him Peter in the prison. And a
[1:46:36] light shined in the prison, and he
[1:46:38] smoked Peter on the side. And I was
[1:46:40] sitting there reading that this evening.
[1:46:41] I thought, "Ain't that a strange way for
[1:46:43] an angel to come?" So I was trying to
[1:46:45] figure it out. It must not have been
[1:46:46] that one with a soft hand that he sent
[1:46:48] to Elijah cuz he come down, you know,
[1:46:50] kind of brushing his brow. Unless Peter
[1:46:52] was such a solid, sound sleeper that he
[1:46:54] had to kind of hit him, "Wake up, boy.
[1:46:55] Wake up.
[1:46:58] Aren't you glad whether you need one
[1:46:59] with a soft hand or a woman with a, you
[1:47:01] know,
[1:47:03] and he smoked Peter on the side and
[1:47:06] raised him up, saying, "Arise up
[1:47:08] quickly." and his chains fell from off
[1:47:11] his hands. And the angel said unto him,
[1:47:13] "Guard thyself,
[1:47:16] and bind on thy sandals,
[1:47:19] angels talking stuff they don't even
[1:47:21] have to do."
[1:47:23] But he broke down the message in a way,
[1:47:25] Brother Daryl, what a common man with
[1:47:27] his shoes off and he'd relaxed himself
[1:47:30] in his robe and he's now he's got to tie
[1:47:32] it up and the angel takes time to tell
[1:47:34] him, "Oh my, g thyself, bind all thy
[1:47:38] sandals." And so he did. And he saith
[1:47:40] unto him, cast thy garment about thee,
[1:47:43] and follow me. And he went out and
[1:47:46] followed him, and whis not that it was
[1:47:50] true which was done by the angel, but he
[1:47:53] thought
[1:47:55] he saw a vision.
[1:48:02] Don't you love him?
[1:48:04] All night,
[1:48:07] all day,
[1:48:10] angels watching over me, my Lord.
[1:48:16] All night,
[1:48:18] all day,
[1:48:22] angels watching over me.
[1:48:26] held all night and all day
[1:48:33] angels are watching over you and me. Oh,
[1:48:38] all night.
[1:48:41] And all day,
[1:48:44] angels watching over me.
[1:48:48] [Music]
[1:48:50] Well, if I die
[1:48:53] before I wait.
[1:48:56] Angels are watching over me. My Lord,
[1:49:01] I pray the Lord
[1:49:04] my soul to take.
[1:49:08] Angels watching over me. Everybody now.
[1:49:12] Oh
[1:49:14] night,
[1:49:16] all day
[1:49:20] watch you be my Lord.
[1:49:24] All night,
[1:49:27] all day.
[1:49:30] Angels watching over me.
[1:49:35] Will God send an angel in this last day.
[1:49:41] Angels are watching over me, my Lord.
[1:49:47] With a rapturing word that'll take this
[1:49:50] bride away.
[1:49:53] Angels watching over me.
[1:49:57] We found her name under the seven seal.
[1:50:04] Angels watching over me, my Lord. He
[1:50:09] called our name and revealed his will.
[1:50:15] Angels watching over me.
[1:50:19] Well, now I'm waiting for my body
[1:50:24] changed.
[1:50:26] Angels are watching over me, my Lord.
[1:50:31] When all my cells will be rearranged,
[1:50:36] angels are watching over me. Singing
[1:50:40] out, well, all night and all day.
[1:50:47] Angels are watching over me, my Lord.
[1:50:53] All night,
[1:50:55] all day,
[1:50:58] angels watching over me.
[1:51:21] Sister Sylvia,
[1:51:23] granddaughter,
[1:51:25] this little little child that was born
[1:51:28] with a lot of things wrong in his body,
[1:51:30] facing surgery, some very important
[1:51:33] things.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; But we believe our God,
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; is still a God of the supernatural,
[1:51:39] don't we?
[1:51:43] Lord Jesus, we're laying our hands
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; upon a little human body, dear God, that
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; you see heavenly father. Lord, what he
[1:51:53] was born with and all these different
[1:51:55] things that the doctors are saying that
[1:51:57] will have to happen to him. But yet,
[1:51:59] Lord Jesus, we believe you're the first
[1:52:01] one who made the human being and place
[1:52:04] them on the earth in your image. Dear
[1:52:06] God, it's written in your word. They lay
[1:52:08] hands on the sick and they shall
[1:52:10] recover.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; We thank you, heavenly father, that
[1:52:13] there's people still in the earth today
[1:52:15] that believe that you can do miracles.
[1:52:18] We believe the angels of God are here in
[1:52:20] this room tonight. Father, I pray in the
[1:52:23] name of Jesus, may the spirit of God
[1:52:26] move, Lord.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; We're not against doctors. We're not
[1:52:29] against surgeries. And if that would be
[1:52:31] your choice, we will accept it that way.
[1:52:33] Father, I pray if that would be your
[1:52:35] will, may your hand be with the surgeon.
[1:52:38] May the angels of God even go there in
[1:52:40] the room. Dear father, in the name of
[1:52:42] Jesus, we believe you Lord for a great
[1:52:45] report. We thank you, Father,
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:51] Bless you, buddy.
[1:52:53] Praise the Lord.
[1:52:55] All night,
[1:52:59] [Music]
[1:53:10] all day.
[1:53:12] Angels watching over me.

[1:54:32] Joy in the presence of the Lord.

[1:55:20] I'm here
[1:55:24] in his presence.
[1:55:28] I'm forgi

[1:57:03] I'm forgi
[1:57:07] and I'm not the same. Yes, I'm changed
[1:57:13] forever
[1:57:15] in his presence.
[1:57:18] Oh, there's nothing like the presence.
[1:57:23] Nothing like the presence,
[1:57:27] nothing like the presence of the Lord.
[1:57:34] There is nothing like the presence.
[1:57:39] Nothing like the presence.
[1:57:43] Nothing like the presence of the Lord.
[1:57:49] Oh, and I'm free
[1:57:54] his presence.
[1:57:57] Yes, I'm here
[1:58:02] in his presence.

[1:58:35] Hallelujah.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; I'm for I'm forgiven.
[1:58:41] I'm not not
[1:58:43] the same. Yes, I'm changed. Oh, thank
[1:58:47] you, Lord.
[1:58:49] It is.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord God. Thank you, Lord.
[1:58:52] Oh, victory is mine.

[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; Got an angel with you. Praise the Lord.
[2:01:01] Thank you, brother Donnie. Let's just
[2:01:03] bow our heads.
[2:01:11] Heavenly Father,
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; Lord, we are just so
[2:01:17] so grateful, Lord, in our hearts that
[2:01:23] for the things
[2:01:25] that was been hidden down through the
[2:01:26] ages and the ages has now been made
[2:01:29] manifested among us, Lord God.
[2:01:32] Your prophet said those great mysterious
[2:01:34] secret that was once in the back part of
[2:01:36] your mind has now been placed into the
[2:01:37] hearts of the believers, Lord. And
[2:01:40] Father God, as that little boy looked
[2:01:42] into that mirror until that moment that
[2:01:43] he realized he's looking at himself, may
[2:01:45] we continue, Lord, to look into the
[2:01:47] mirror of your word, dear God, until it
[2:01:49] strikes our very soul, dear God, of who
[2:01:53] we are and where we came from and where
[2:01:54] we're going. Oh God, we pray as we
[2:01:58] depart from this service this evening,
[2:02:00] Lord, may we never depart from your
[2:02:01] presence and go with your children,
[2:02:03] Lord, as they make their way home, watch
[2:02:05] over them on the highways, Lord. And
[2:02:07] God, we pray tonight that every person
[2:02:08] that was prayed for, Lord, and every
[2:02:10] person that wanted to be here and
[2:02:11] couldn't because of a sickness or an
[2:02:13] affliction, we ask you, dear God, may
[2:02:15] you confirm your word, Lord. For you
[2:02:17] said, "I am the Lord, thy God, who heals
[2:02:19] all thy diseases." Lord, we believe that
[2:02:22] to be the truth, Lord. God, we just
[2:02:24] commit these things into your hands. We
[2:02:25] ask dear God that you strengthen our
[2:02:27] precious brother Donnie Lord his
[2:02:29] strength. Renew it dear God we pray. We
[2:02:31] thank you dear God for his life and for
[2:02:33] his ministry and what it means to all of
[2:02:34] us here Lord and those around the world.
[2:02:37] Thank you God for such a wonderful gift
[2:02:38] you've placed among us. Father God we
[2:02:41] just now commit these things into your
[2:02:42] hands for your glory. We ask these
[2:02:44] things in Jesus name. Go with your
[2:02:46] children we pray for thy glory. Amen.
[2:02:50] God bless you saints. Sing us pray.
[2:02:55] Amen. Amen. It's just worship him as we
[2:02:58] go tonight. Have you enjoyed the word of
[2:03:00] God?
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful? Amen.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; Victory is mine.
[2:03:08] Victory is mine.
[2:03:11] Victory today is mine.
[2:03:17] I told Satan to get me behind.
[2:03:22] Victory is mine.
[2:03:27] When I woke up this morning, I didn't
[2:03:32] have a doubt. I knew that the Lord would
[2:03:36] bring me out.
[2:03:39] So I got down on my knees and said,
[2:03:42] "Lord, help me please." I got to sing
[2:03:46] and shout victory.
[2:03:51] Victory is mine.
[2:03:54] Victory is mine.
