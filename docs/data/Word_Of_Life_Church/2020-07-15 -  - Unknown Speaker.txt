TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and you two lived in the first century which one of the churches that I just mentioned would you'd went to I'll tell you let me look at your makeup and I'll tell you if you'd had the choice some you don't want to Corinth no question about it some of you want allure to the Ephesian Church because you deem yourself theologians you considered yourself sodium you never went to that collation sir Wow they questioned the Prophet I got I wouldn't sell unbelievers but all of them and if you had the Holy Ghost you get all of them you might not have understood how they listen to some liar to try to tell you the pollen a prophet of God but you love them anyhow right so which church would you went to and yet Paul said these with the Holy Ghost love all the saints you imagine if they ever had fellowship means and you've got a Christian believer sent my son in Ephesians believer that Corinthian believers just bouncing off the peace Oh glory to conquer that deep Ephesian theologians Oh God I see the devil got on me to set by you I definitely wasn't letter the Lord to sit on the same hue you said huh I must have been strictly in the flesh and then the Galatian believer over here and I thought that's not like a believer over there but all of those that have the Holy Ghost and Ephesian believer we've been able to go up and grab the hand of a Christian believer if it is stood still long enough huh hit him on over and grab ahold of his head and put his arm around me I love brother I love you god bless you see you some other time not us we ignore them stay away from them because we don't like them now remember hatred friends you can't go by your definition of hatred hatred is just several degrees farther than dislike it's a detestable dislike that you have for an individual if God were to weigh us out in this building tonight or in this message I wonder how much hatred would be all inside the ranks of this message or inside this church
