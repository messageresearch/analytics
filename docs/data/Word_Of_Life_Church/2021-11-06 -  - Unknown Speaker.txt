leading you praise god let's turn tonight to genesis chapter 15 if you would verse verse 13. such a privilege for us to be together again in the house of the lord everybody amen feels comfortable tonight can take your mask off it's up to you hallelujah it's up to you now if i don't get no amens you're getting five back on praise the lord praise the lord hallelujah i know it's so hard on you children i have to get out and go a little bit and when i wear one i tell carol i'm out in the world people make it she said you ought to wear one as you can imagine me wearing one preaching i'm so sorry we've had to genesis 15 13. i mean he wants to get in the spirit tonight and he said unto abram know of assurity that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years and also that nation whom they shall serve will i judge and afterward shall they come out with great substance now this is god's word and he's going to take somebody to prove it by verse 15 and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace thou shalt be buried in a good old age but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full and he believes god has a time and a season for his word to be fulfilled now it's not only just a time for the righteous and the good but as we can see from this scripture that there's also a time that the evil must be filled let me read you this in question and answers in 1954 we've got to get in the spirit of the last days when the last days are here you go to a dance hall and you've got to get in the spirit of dancing or they won't dance now i've never been to a dance hall so i don't know anything about them but i do remember talking to a man that used to come to church here years ago and i'd talk to him and talk to him and talk to him about the lord and try to make it so simple and i'd spend two and a half hours with him on the phone and after i'd get done with him he still wasn't sure if the lord loved him and all this rigamaroad anyway finally he finally come out and just told me that he really really had a problem i said well what what is it he said i love to get on that dance floor and start dancing now in my mind i thought i can't hardly believe this because i knew that guy very well and i thought i cannot imagine you on the dance floor but apparently there was something about dancing that had such a grip on him that he couldn't let go of dancing to let go of the lord and i simply told him look man all you need to do is change partners we're not against dancing we're just against dancing with the devil's tombs right but it shows that there's a spirit that goes with dancing with drinking with many of these things he said you go to church and you've got to get in the spirit of worship before you can worship the world's got to get in the spirit of the last days before the last days can come and we're in the spirit of the last days now this is 1954 what about now 2021 almost 2022 and god's promise that these things would be here and that's what we've got where in the last days and men and women are setting asleep and don't realize it oh my don't let it be me lord let's pray together lord jesus we love you so much tonight we're so glad to be back together again father we just love church i'm not talking about the formality of just gathering together as some type of social something church is not a social event to us it's a place where we worship and we sing and we pray and we hear testimonies of what you've done and we make our requests known and we sense that great mighty god that we're going to see is with us we so long lord jesus to be together in your presence we thank you for this opportunity again tonight lord we pray that you take your word and just speak to us father would you make your word real the needs of your people were asking you lord that you just be mindful father god lord i've got a brother on my heart tonight and i don't want to say his request his need but lord jesus you know my heart you know who it is and father he's in a great need right now lord i pray you'd move from my brother dear god all those others that are sick and afflicted father would you move for your children we pray in the name of the lord jesus and the saints of god said wow deacon brothers if y'all hand out another mask i'm going to skin you off that sounded like my church saying amen god bless you can be seated sister joanne tessa we're so glad to see you back in church tonight i was looking today and i did uh i wanted to do a chur study on the spirit of so you put in a quotation mark to the left and then you type in your words then you put a quotation mark at the end of whatever words you want to be together in that conjunction of joining it together and i found over 3500 quotes that the prophet was talking about the spirit of this and the spirit of that the spirit of god the spirit of the lord the spirit of blindness the spirit of darkness the spirit of the last days spirit of the last times on and on and on and on over 3 500 times in the message that it was mentioned and i found so many that were quite overwhelming of what actually has a spirit that goes along with it so there was a spirit of fear a spirit of joy a spirit of love a spirit of happiness so many different things that was connected with a spirit and then i found where he had made reference to the book of ephesians where that paul had said by the holy spirit of promise and then i begin to realize that god not only has a spirit that motivates his people but the devil also being a spirit being and satan has all types of spirits which are demons that motivate his people and we know that the spirit of blindness that would grab a hold of a optical nerve and the prophet rebuked that several times and he would speak to that demon and he said thou demon that has a hold of that optical nerve and then he would command it to let go then he would speak also to another demon apparently a different one in the form of cataracts and then he would call that demon so as i begin to look at that i realize how diversified that the kingdom of darkness really is and how that satan chooses so many different aspects to be able to manifest himself because he is a spirit being so we can see why that the world actually cannot enter into the fullness of the last days until the lid has been tore off of hell and it would allow demon spirits to be able to pour out in every direction so we know when all hell breaks loose all of heaven comes down so it's a parallel i believe where we are don't you so god you know god knew that this would happen so it didn't take him by surprise at all and god knew that the people in the days prior to the anti-living destruction that before that time could come god could not make it come upon the earth because god is not the officer of sin sickness disease trouble heartache but it's as if so that god allows satan a release in time by which he's able to anoint his people and anoint the people of the world in a way that they hadn't been anointed quite before and something comes upon the earth as if hell begins to vomit out or something comes out from the gates of hell now keep this in mind the gates of hell that something begins to release from the gates of hell remember it was an angel there that had them bound in revelation as we see it and whenever there was a great chain that was released and a key that unlocked and when it did smoke a rose out of the bottomless pit and apollyon and abaddon being his name the greek and it released one out of this prison which was held captive there so we can see by these intervals that god does not let satan move as he wishes he cannot be able to go upon the earth even as he so desires remember in the book of job and god asked him where have you been he said walking up and down the earth seeking whom i may devour being able to do what he can so even then we see that he must seek he must actually seek out what he can do he must find avenues resource channels by which he can flow through it so he doesn't just have free course at any time now this convinces me that a lot of times the things that you and i allow to go on our lives it's not that satan had the power to do it he was watching us and waiting for a moment of weakness that he could not do it at will he could not do it just because he hates you and he certainly does but don't you know that if he had the power to do against us at leisure all of us would done be dead don't you believe all the real saints of god would then be wiped off the earth so sometimes god allows him to come against us and i'm convinced more than we realize that sometimes we allow him to come against us and it's not so much that it's necessarily the will of god but in the moment of weakness when we've not prayed when we've not really been where we ought to be with the lord and satan will watch us in that time of weakness you know as it happened to all of us but it ought to make us as the children of god want to be more alert more aware and more conscience of our stand in the truth that satan cannot come and push us over just any time he wishes to but there is an allocation of demonic warfare that has been released in every age and we know that actually the world wars followed the administration of the release of god we can look down through the church ages as god sent a message and it was the blast of a gospel trumpet and when you look whenever that trumpet reverberated across the earth and you'll watch the wars the napoleonic wars and you'll watch the wars in europe following actor luther's reformation and you watch and the reformation under wesley and you watch wars as they begin to break out and it's actually because the gospel trumpet has sounded and it has declared a war then you watch the natural wars and the plagues that will follow whenever that happens you ever study on the plagues and how they parallel to the release of the messages of god down through the church ages you think it just happened to be that the bubonic plague and many of these things just happened at leisure but notice how that after the message of god strikes the earth and the light of god comes on the earth and the people reject it then watch what happens all types of calamity and diseases and all sorts of things will happen to the inhabitants of the earth wake up america wake up message people don't you understand one of the things we're going to right now is part of the finale of the rejection of the world against the message of the end time now let me tell you right now you think covet is bad covet is nothing compared to what's fixing to come we are still under the dispensation of the grace of god if satan is allowed to do all that has been done just under covet itself under the rainbow of the blood of the lord jesus covering the earth then i want you to contemplate for a few minutes what it's going to be like when the lord lifts the bride off the earth and the blood is removed from the mercy seat there will not be one more gentile that will be saved and the bible says whoa whoa whoa and to the inhabiters of the earth for the devil has come down unto them and he knows that he has but a short time to work i'll tell you one thing i don't want to be here and i'll tell you one thing you don't want to be here either if it's bad right now and we've seen all this went on in the last year and a half for soul what will it be once the lord jesus takes away his sweetheart out of this earth and the devil is allowed the full strength of his dominion to manifest all he's wanted to do for thousands of years hi to so rock of ages but you know we don't want to just focus on the negative side and we know the negativity must also be preached in order to magnify the greatness of the positive side of what god is doing but what we want to look at tonight is that we must get in the spirit of the word the the allotment or the increment of the word that god has allocated for us and if satan cannot stop you as a believer from embracing the message of the hour and you believe it with all your heart your soul your mind your strength if he cannot make you deny this word and say well i'm not following no more then he will try other tactics to get you to change your focus of what's really so important in this life he'll cause so many troubles in our homes troubles on the job troubles and our church troubles around us everywhere so that we by our troubles devalue not intentionally but we devalue what we are setting under and that is the impact of the reveal word of the hour are we having trouble search sure we are are we having problems are we having issues sure we are but our god is greater than our issues our god is greater than everything that we are going through and the church said why because he told us greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world now sometimes god will say his word and he will let it lay there for years in this case it's going to be the fourth generation 430 years after god tells him this and abraham you're not going to see it but it will be your seed and god even tells them bad things are going to happen to your children bad things are going to happen to your seed and i'm going to go ahead and warn you he said this nation that does this to them i will punish them now god's got to have somebody to fulfill this word god is not speaking of cherubims he's not speaking of an angelic host but god is speaking of human beings human beings that are worthy of his word no let me tell you tonight all the heroes of god that have lived down through time there has not been a one of them that has been worthy of the grace or the blessing or the things of god so some of you fight this that you're unworthy and you're unworthy will join the rest of us unworthy mortals because there ain't none of us worthy of the grace of god the goodness of god the power of god that's why it's grace because god gives it to us it is unmerited favor now watch god unveils his revelation to abram and now he changes his name in chapter 22 of course into abraham genesis 22 15 and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time and said by myself have i sworn saith the lord notice now this was the angel of the capital l capital o capital r capital d the angel of the lord which was christ theophany pre-existence form of the lord jesus before a human appearance and the angel of the lord coloned abraham out of heaven saying the second time and said by myself i have sworn so this angel is the very person of god or it is the personage of god taking on a form that can deal with human beings saith the lord for because thou hast done this thing that is not withheld thyme sun thy an only son that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies now again this is a promise and god is going to use mortals not angels but human beings to fulfill his word now i hope you understand tonight this promise of genesis 22 17 is still just as present and ongoing as it was when the theophanic appearance of christ appeared to abraham thousands of years ago now the promised nature was made in the first happened sense of it into the natural seed of abraham but now we have excelled and went beyond the natural genealogy of abraham and we are the spiritual seed of abraham from dust to stars amen so our destiny is coming back from stars to dust because we come from there we'll come back here and take up perfect bodies and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies now watch there's a great parallel that lays in this terminology that the angel of the lord or christ michael had now spoke and he said thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies once you notice that it's all gathered up it doesn't say they not they but they shall possess the gate of his enemies so it's gathered in the personal pronoun now i realize we're living in a woke generation and we're living in a generation when people don't like his and her and one of our states yesterday just passed the law to where that you know you don't have to be either a male or a female as far as gender but you can put it on all your official documents and congress of course wanted to get rid of he and her and congressman and congresswoman and make them just a neutral saying well i may be a little bit old-fashioned but i still believe god knows the difference between men and women now i realize a lot of the blind way of the sins are so blind that they can look at what looks like a woman but they don't want to call it a woman and they look at what looks like a man but they don't want to call it a hymn because they don't want to offend nobody well i i don't want to offend somebody but it's the right body and if i've got to offend you to keep from offending him well you know the rest of the story but we know how the world is they don't want to offend anybody out there yeah i'll see who you don't want to offend you don't want to film these bunch of men that goes around kissing men and women that kisses women and they got their hair green and purple and polka dots drops and they look like something to come out of the insane institution but you don't care to offend us only once it's got a right mind you don't care to life about us and make fun of us come on now if you don't want to offend somebody take this practice and don't offend the salt of the earth because when the salt's taken this thing's going to turn into a big mess [Applause] you see this is the secret to this verse he who possessed the gates is he who possessed the city he who possessed the gates possessed the cities he who possessed the cities possess the country so your god is giving them a promise that shows them whatever gates that will come against you in your conquest to take this land i will give you those gates now in the old testament many of those gates of course were natural gates and it was a parable of what would be a type of us and what our spiritual gates are and many of us have gates tonight many of you've got gates in your life that's trying to hinder you from a full procession of what god wants you to have but this is your promise you might as well go and put your name in there and the angel of the lord said to dave swanson or the angel of the lord said to jackie tipton or to carol or wade or anne or whoever more and you've got to take this promise as personal as it is to yourself you've got a sickness in front of you and is trying to wall off the blessing of god you need to walk right up to that gate as a son of god or a daughter of god and say gate out of my way hallelujah notice this brother ben says notice god said your seed the seed of abraham would possess the gates of his enemy he would take the gates and possess the gates he promised it now his natural seed did all of that all of abraham's natural seed was the prophets that came after him so there was moses abraham's seat and when he did he came to the gate in a line of duty he come to the gate of the red sea now watch how he takes this so moses comes to the gate of a red sea now he's at the gulf of aqaba and whenever you look at this new place that they just scientifically found just a few years ago it looks like only one particular place by which they could come down the way of horror and be able to cross down the described way i'm not sure if you know it or not but there's actually a message preacher that helped the land of israel several years ago find the proper place where jesus was baptized in the river jordan this man has been there for many many years he's the brother actually we went was on our lady's show a couple years ago to israel and he kept telling the god that he would have been there been many many trips he kept telling them y'all got the wrong place you've got the wrong place jesus was baptized where moses and them came across and he went back to the scripture and kept showing them it's the wrong place but the last time we was there we got to stand at the right place and you can imagine israel flew this brother from where he lives over to their big place and made a great big recognition of it i thought praise be to god why because a message brother that was taught in the scripture and was able to help these people of antiquity and as we stood there and there stood right across where moses and them saw the land the promised land of what god said they just recently built a place there and all the people's coming down and been baptized and now they've changed it to where this is a place jesus is baptized why because jesus in the old testament form of yeshua or joshua is the very same place he crossed though they come up to this place and what is it there is a gate so they come to the gulf of aqaba and whatever they do so they send the sonar down through the gulf of aqaba and they find there's only one strait by which they can come across and what did god do god allowed the enemy to come right in they come down to this narrow gulf of aqaba and when they get in there the mountains is all around them they are totally surrounded and they get in and they can't get out that sounds like the way my father likes to do things sometimes and if you ever see the way it's laid out these gigantic mountains up on both sides you've got the red sea in front of you and you turn this way to go out and you can't get out because here comes the army of pharaoh and god allowed you to get him then how many has ever been hemmed up like that before why are you saying why would god do that to express his glory oh to show he's greater than the rocks he's bigger than the red sea he's bigger than your affliction he's bigger than your disease [Applause] mama so here come moses in the line of duty and what did he run into the gate of the red sea after teaching the children of israel the promised land that god had promised he was god's prophet he had been manifested before the people as god's prophet well how many can say that we've had one coming our day that was a manifested and even a greater way thank god he goes on to say in the same paragraph down below a bit right in the line of duty he come up against something that he know not what to do that was the red sea well what happened the seed of abraham was promised to possess the enemy's gates so when the red sea became a gate that he couldn't come through god moved upon the scene and took the gate and went away with it and moses walked across the sea on dry land his seed possessed the gate praise god his seed possess the gate how many is the seed of abraham i mean it's got a need in your life you need to change the name of that need to a gate a gate of disease a gate of poverty a gate of fear a gate of anxiety and let's serve notice on that gate tonight look out gate here i come hallelujah but remember we must get in the spirit of the lord to be able to make this happen let me go to one of brother daryl's favorite characters to preach about in the old testament and he could take my notes right now and i'm sure do a much better job on this guy his name is shamgar judges chapter 5 3 verse 30 so moab was subdued that day under the hand of israel and the land had rest for four score years and after him was shamgar the son of anus which slew of the philistines 600 men with an ox goat and he also delivered israel now samgar is a different sort of a hero you know a lot of folks get in their mind that all of god's heroes are those of great genealogy and those that come from a great oh my great great matriarch of a mother and a great patriarch of a father and they got saved when they were four or five years old filled with the holy ghost and there were about eight or nine they walked the straightening narrow way they went to the monastery in tucson and then they moved to the monastery in jeffersonville and then they moved to a monastery here and there and there they never had no well that's the way some of y'all talk to me when you talk about how low down and rotten you all are you act like everybody that ever amounted to anything never said anything wrong and never done nothing wrong i'm not sure what comic book you're reading but if i was you i'd get rid of it god's heroes have been some of the weakest most flawed most disrespected most looked down upon human beings that ever walked on the earth you know samson was a great mighty man his birth was announced by an angel of god he was a special man but god don't have all of his whole heroes to be sampsons here's another hero of the bible by the name of shamgar now let's look at shamgar a little bit shamgar is a foreign name or hirian h-u-r-r-i-a-n hurian samgar is not a jewish name at all shamgar is a foreign hearing name an anus is the name of the canaanite goddess of sex and war ah so you've got a heria name and your daddy is named after a goddess of sex and war well that wouldn't be much to be proud of would now how many of y'all won't say tell that's what your daddy's name was or your mama saying well some of that might not have been your daddy's name but it was your daddy's nature or your mama's nature well go ahead come on down now and some of you wound up at that same rotten sorry thing and then you look at yourself and say well i battled this thing all my life whatever it is i ain't no good i'll never amount to nothing can you imagine shamgar had to live above a syrian name the herians were a people that lived before abraham the hirian texts the cuneiform one of the ancient things of archaeology if you know anything about it it's one of the ancient deeds by which they referenced and they're able to determine how much that abraham was able to pay for his land so the hirian text it's a great great artifact and this this man why in the world would any jewish mother and father name their son after a syrian name it'd be like calling your son ricky knowing what the prophet said about it well come on now elvis rat cat dog mouse you know something like that now notice this warrior so his name is a hyrian name his daddy's name is named after the goddess of war and sex goddess she was actually the sister of baal and this is your daddy's name well how come you folks are not moving some of y'all ain't even batting an eye well go ahead friends just go ahead and be identified with it that's where some of us were our daddy was low down and rotten and our mother and our grandma and this and that and the other yes sort of like shamgar let's not just go to shamgar with the ox goat but let's go with shamgar pre-ox goat what did shamgar have to deal with within himself feeling like god would ever use him a hearing name and his daddy calls such a thing oh my notice this judges chapter 3 verse 31. and after him was shamgar the son of amnest which slew of the philistines 600 men with an oscar now we know it was the manner of the philistines that they would allow the jews to go in and plant the crops and then when it come harvest time for them to be able to take their corn and their wheat or whatever more here and you know what them sorry things would do they would invade the land and why were they even there in the first place because the children of israel the forefathers of this man and many others did not drive them totally out and god said because you don't do that i'm going to leave them here and they're going to be a thorn in your side so they were every year though they wouldn't go in there in the springtime and dig it all up whenever it's playing well i know why in the world do that but let them jews get out there and work all that corn and work all that barley and all that wheat and then whenever it come time to harvest it and get ready to take it to the market here they had come well year after year this had happened old sham guard now maybe shamgar said you know what i'm not a worthy guy i'm not a good guy look at my name look at what i've been look at my daddy everybody in the israel knows who i am oh my they know what kind of background that i've got oh sure i can see god using moses i can see god using this man or this woman but why would god ever use a man with a hearing name why would god ever use a man whose father was named after a sex goddess but god said i choose you to fulfill a couple of verses in the book of judges now he never reigned 40 years he never reigned 20 years he was not a judge for 15 or 20 years according to history about one year but he made the pages of the book and he had to make them pages of the book over his own frailty over his own background god i wish somebody would preach with me tonight over his own background over his own name can you imagine dealing with all the humiliation and the shame and so on that he went through but somehow something raised up in this man so year by year they would come in oh my and there was a band of thieves and robbers oh you know what they've got different names today but it's the same devils that anointed them for listings it's fear of covet anxiety of covet nervousness about this oppression about that sadness about that i think some of you daughters of god tonight need to get sick and tired of being sick and tired and say you rotten stinking devil you've stole my health you've stole my son you're trying to take my daughter but as a daughter of god i let you know gates of hell i'm claiming my children for the economy of god i will take my ox goat i will take my hammer and my nail i will abuse whatever god's put in my hand give him back satan oh my these guys got so bad that according to the book of judges chapter 5 verse 6 and the days of shanghai the son of anus in the days of jail the highways were unoccupied and the travelers walked through byways now it was so bad so like new york denver portland it got so bad that people were afraid to even use the four lane as we'll say they were afraid to use the main highway so they started cutting little paths from farm to farm and they were so terrified because of all these thieves that were on the main highway well let me tell you something there's another great main highway that has invaded many of the lives of the people of the world it's called the highway of social media well glory to god it's invade many of our lives many of our homes and many of us would be better off if we spend more time on our knees before the presence of god instead of our phone or our laptop at our fingertips calling on the name of our children before the presence of god and meeting these philistines uncircumcised devils of lust and idolatry and music and movies and all kinds of stuff that's trying to steal our homes oh my and we let them philistines know i am a possessor of the gates oh my brother donnie i just get so caught up with it if you can't handle a smartphone get a dumb one they still make the flip ones if you ain't got enough in here to keep you from getting on the stuff that you ought not to be here get you a phone i'd rather carry one around that big i mean like this you're on it that big my goodness i'd rather have that than be tempted every day of my life if i ain't got enough holy ghost to control it [Applause] can you just imagine he walked into his house that day and said wife i believe god's going to help us look at it won't you come here look grabbed the baton by the hand the arm prophet said her clothes was all ragged and tattered little children look support and pick it they'd about starve to death because all the philistines would leave them was just enough seed corn and enough seed taters so they'd plant their crop next year so they had to ration everything they ate for the rest of the winter so in case some of you are thinking god is running out of joy let me tell you he's got abundance supply if you're afraid that we're going to shout all the joy out don't worry we could shout now for another 100 billion years and never shout it all out well brother donna i'm i'm afraid i'll have to ration his goodness and his mercy he's got more than you and i can ever imagine oh my why we ought to come into those back doors back on with such joy in our heart that we're so glad to be in the house of god and we're coming to sing and we're coming to worship and we're coming to pray and we're coming to say amen to the word and we're just coming to let hell know whose side we're all oh glory to god sometimes i just like to show up and say hey devil have you take note i'm here i'm here devil i want you to know whose side i'm all [Applause] oh mom i want you to notice this so the bible says i tremble shamgar the son of a naz would slow the philistines 600 men with an ox goat an ox goat is an instrument of wood about eight feet long armed with an iron iron spike or brass at one point on one end which was to spur the ox and also to scrape the plow what a weapon our government spends millions of dollars on trying to outsmart the russians and the chinese and god uses an ox code [Applause] glory to god god can take one little simple believer that's facing things and the doctors are baffled their side their tests come back we don't understand we don't know this we can't understand we can't put it all together and god can take one little simple person and yeah they're using less than ox go but they're using their face and they aim it right toward the gate of that enemy and they walk in the doctor's office and the doctor said i don't know what it was but it's gone whatever it was it's disappeared and the doctor is scratching the head and trying to figure out well we don't exactly know what it is and yet we want to put our trust in all the great things i met i'm grateful for everything that science can do but my answer is not science my answer is god if god uses science i say praise the lord but you know as well as i do there's many times science don't know what to do to help us praise god well i mean this guy's a farmer so he don't walk out there and pull out of his pack ah here's a super scanner i'll lean this laser right toward their heads and it'll do this and it'll somehow separate the doom if watch it from the you know the watching but call it on that side and it'll divide the perennial side from the right side and it'll do so and so but he just looked at it and said hallelujah i believe this will do it it moves oxen surely it can move humans it can clean a pile well i'll tell one thing i thought god cleaned my plow many times you [Applause] you see the philistines had taken every sword you understand that in the and the camp of israel there was not one sword left there was no helmets no shields no bucklers there was not one weapon so the devil thought listen to me friends i want you to remember this quote greatest battle ever thought you see his attack watch listen close as closing his attack is what disbelieve god's word that's his attack though can't you see the greatest battle that's ever fall there's only two forces satan and god and watch satan's weapon against you try to get you to disbelieve your weapons and you know several years ago the russians had one of their mig fighters and it was reported that that thing could fly like 2.8 mark and then someone else said no no no no it's way faster than that it's 3.2 and when the americans began to hear about it it terrified them because at that time they didn't have anything that would anywhere come close to this so they started ramping up and building faster and faster pratt and whitney and all the different ones started building their engines so much more thrust so they could be able to do this that another but you know what one day a russian pilot flew one of those migs into a u.s base and turned it over to the americans and whatever they did oh they were so tickled that they got it but you know what they found out they found out that thing was near as bad as what they were told you know what it was propaganda they already found out their gym they already found out their jets were already faster they were better they could fly higher but it was propaganda that was telling them we got something you don't god that's exactly what he does to you and now he wants to tell him the word ain't good enough oh you don't need to go to church all the message ain't good enough no more yes it is oh you need something better you need something good oh no we don't god gave us the best he had and that was his word it's faster it fly higher it'll raise you up on glory to god no matter what the devil says [Applause] but he'll want to tell you mine's worse than yours i'm back to the barn he said remember the man with the dream the devil said boo and the man well then something like raised up and he said blew back and whenever he started blowing the devil every time he blew the devil the devil would get with her and littler why he was bluffing him so his weapon is to try to make you doubt your weapon so at least i can spend all these years of these great polished things oh my he's got years and years and years he's using the same thing he used on eve in the garden of eden make you doubt your weapon praise god but sometimes all it takes is somebody that knows what they got what's your head there brother kirk i'm right on you don't move buddy let the devil laugh let him make fun the instruments we have been issued have they have fought wars down through time amen they have overcome death hell and the grace what's satan's weapon against you try to get you to disbelieve your weapon he disarms you so here you've got these nuclear if you wish to call it that you've got these warheads they're just now breaking into hypersonic hypersonic missiles hypersonic airplanes that wanted to come up with helicopters that can fly thousands of miles hypersonic speed what that means it's faster than the speed of sound already they're traveling at 4.5 mark that that's four times the speed of sound moving that fast thousand four thousand five thousand miles an hour do you understand some of our most secretive airplanes can be across the atlantic coast in less than an hour's time and can send missiles from hundreds and hundreds of miles away and they're building them now where the bombers will not even have a man in them they'll be controlled from a remote control lord god of man is able to build a bomber that he can send up you remember the ssr-71 the blackbird able to fly 72 000 feet fly so high that they couldn't even see it didn't even know it was there they're trying to send them whatever more accurate they couldn't even know it was there and now they're making the brethren to it and it's going to be where they can fly with the pilot or without and will be controlled oh glory to god if man can able to make a machine like that why cannot we surrender to the holy ghost and instead of us flying our life instead of us doing the bombing let the master in the control room oh glory to god let him remotely control our lives go back straight forward dip die [Applause] hallelujah listen the prophet said if he can get you to disbelief your weapon is equivalent if he gets you to believe that your weapon is not strong enough he's disarmed you well i'm not sure i've tried the word but it don't seem like it's working oh god oh my god i've i've called it your word the word works children but what's man do better better faster faster more more i just saw a picture yesterday of a general four class shift that they're placing at 13 billion dollars 13 billion the largest in the world never been nothing like it why america wants to be the top dog i hate to say it but there's bombs over here with your name earlier on in america because you turned down god's word i don't have a nimitz class i don't have a gerald r ford class i'm of the jesus christ class praise me to god hallelujah oh brother neville i hope you never disbelieve that look he disarms you when he gets you to disbelieve that weapon when you lay that down that finishes your fight you're done hold that weapon don't lay it down well i don't mind telling you to slay 600 philistines with an eight foot long stick with a piece of metal on the end of it it's a miracle within itself in reality if you kill 600 of them in a lifetime once we're talking about trained men they were hardened they were callous they were professionals [Applause] and you killed 600 in a lifetime brother i'll tell you what would give you the purple heart but you killed 600 in one stand in one time don't you see what god is doing god is saying i have given my word some human being is going to take the gates of the philistines and you're still a man i'm not worthy i'm not good enough like in my background look at this look at that you can look at that all you want to and go nowhere or you can look at that something that is pulsating inside of your heart why not me instead of well not me not me why not you why not me why not you brother rob why not you brother paul why not use some of your sister god's going to have somebody that will defeat cancer why not you [Applause] i could have stood up here and said really i mean come on god looks like to me if you'd wanted me to do this you should give me a whole lot better stuff to work with that sounds like aka donny reagan looks like to me god if you want to be a better preacher you'd make me like tim prayer to make me like ron spencer or make me like this and i said i want you to be like him i want you to be an old rox goat i want you to be about so tall and so wide and for homer long gloria said whenever you stand underneath the clothesline you drink red coolidge you look like a thermometer signing sideways i don't want you to be a big man i don't want you to be a smart man i just want you to be a stick in my hand i'm going to use you to clean some plows around the person i'm going to use you to slay philistines hallelujah to god i want to use you to make nervous devils ever well i want to tell you something friend that's not just said about me i believe god's got laity all over the world young men young women that has got a purpose in you being here [Applause] i i love the way the prophet dramatizes this i see him look down at his little wife ragged sleeves about naked looked his little children their little faces were pale starved to death these big old husky philistines come in take what they've got or sure to starve through the winter it's about like the little church today brother pale anemia what we need is the courage and the word of god stand out there and let them old robbers come up run them away now shamgar said now get here i'm not no warrior i can't fight for 600 men what am i going to do i can see him pace back and forth he didn't know what to do coming closer trump trump trump a few minutes all of his oats would be gone all the wheat and corn would be gone everything he laid up his family would be start everything he'd done had been taken off that big enemy country there given to the enemy the first thing you know here we go god oh yeah brothers beyond the nimitz class and the journal our forward class year we come to deity class oh glory to god it ain't me it ain't you it ain't us as a group it's one god it's when god god began to move on him i like that he began to get angry my he looked around and he thought oh my i'm an israelite i'm circumcised that's uncircumcised the listing coming up there i'm not a soldier i ain't got time to go out here and take some lessons and learn how to duel a little late for dueling buddy them philistines were not duelers they were killers listen friends these demons we are fighting they are not proper dealers they are killers they are thieves they are robbers they are murderers and liars we don't need to learn how to do we need to pull our sword i'm giving you your last warning devil one step closer and you lose that smile how would you like for me to rearrange your face and put your nose where your ear is i'm warning you i'm a son or daughter of god i'm filled with the holy ghost i'm sick and tired of you treading on my peace i'm sick and tired of you treading on my joy and my health and my god said oh hallelujah i wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in house he said you know what an ox goat is a little thing had a brass knob on the end of it you beat the cattle through the corrales reached up and got that ox goat well you ain't much but neither am i he reached up and got that us goad he didn't have time to train to be some kind of fighter the emergency was at hand oh glory to god he had to do it then god gave the promises and god gave the promise to abraham he said he would possess the gates of his enemies shamgar believe that i challenge anyone in this building tonight or anyone that'll hear this that's got enough faith take the name sham guard of that quote and put yours in it i challenge you amen as a servant of god look at the odds against him or her whichever one it is god only needs one man just let him get one man in his hand the world will think he's crazy but he'll drive home the gospel when he's done thoroughly convinced that jesus christ remains the same yesterday today and forever what if sam gardner said now wait a minute i've got to wait them coming i better go away to some school a little while and learn how to make a denominational creed duel dude listen know if he'd have done that that's all he'd ever known but he'd never done the job of this dueling he took god at his promise that he would possess the gate of his enemy can i use one more one that's much more famous man by the name of samson judges 16 2 and it was told the gaze out saying samson has come hither and they can pass them in and laid weight for him all night in the gate of the city and we're quite all than not saying in the morning when it is day we shall kill him samson lay till midnight and arose at midnight and took the doors the doors of the gate of the city and the two posts now i'll tell one thing it'd take a good strong man to take both of these doors and there's probably brothers in here that could do it but let me give you a little clearer picture theologians historians and archaeologists who have found and dug into the city of gotham and found where these ancient gates at one time stood say that them gates are you ready weighed between eight and ten tons ten feet wide two feet thick hello between 16 and 20 000 pounds not a crane a shrimp remember the prophet said he didn't have shoulders the size of a barn door he was a little short curly headed mama's boy well glory to god hallelujah it wasn't that he had great big old muscles like hercules and charles atlas and all of that my that wasn't a miracle it was when the spirit of god moved on this little curly headed shrimp lord of god [Applause] so he picks up the gates and the bars notice what the bible says and he carried them up to the top of a hill that is before hebron 20 miles away at an elevation of over 3 000 feet higher than where he was so he's going uphill hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah eight to ten times glory to god sixteen to twenty thousand pounds uphill amen i always knew this was a miracle but they didn't realize how great it was till the other day and i got to study in it i nearly burnt the carpet up downstairs in my steady oh lord god you're the same god you're the same god in our time of need oh i went upstairs and told carol about it saw when the brothers at the church shared it with him this week about lowe's i've been about ready to blow up to tell somebody i'm glad y'all here tonight so i can tell 20 miles 16 000 pounds oh i know i know i know i'm trying to look in somebody else's face you think that ain't nothing compared to what i'm packing let me tell you something that was a symbol you see samson not in his weakness with the women but there was a symbol embedded in this you see the gates of causal have been referred to as the kids of hell the lord god wanted to tie back to happily tell you so the enemy compassed him round about and soldiers around his tomb hallelujah and about midnight he got up and cheated deaths hallelujah oh hallelujah glory to god so before three days had passed i can see our lord jesus come back into that body inside of that tomb inside of the gaze of walls if you will all shut up hallelujah to god but what did he do he broke the gates he broke the bars oh all of these men had great victories that every one of them would have come to die samson died with his enemy and shamgar no doubt died and all the rest of them died but our lord jesus went into death hallelujah he went into death and he grabbed the hope of the gates of death and said my children don't fear it no more don't fear it hallelujah oh some of you will go that way but don't worry look here i've got the gates hallelujah when it comes up your sleeve don't fear i took the case the prophet said in a prophet he was but he was more than a prophet he was a prophet plus there had been many prophets and all the prophets died at the gate of death but this man took the keys of death held in grave like sam's undead the gates of gaza took it out took the sting and death itself and swallowed up in victory and rose up on the third day triumph makes his believers more than conquerors it's already conquered there's nothing left to do but walk right straight in with the victor song in our hearts he is the great triumph one he's the great one that was more than a prophet let me close with this one when you get this spirit in you the burdens of this life becomes light you don't notice them anymore your yoke is lined with feathers they become so easy and the people pile things on you you know what you're like in the gates of gaza who picked up the big brass gate and packed it up on the hill now listen it's your type and when you get to a place that the holy spirit has you not you the holy spirit but the holy spirit has you you say i got the holy ghost i don't think that should be said you must say the holy ghost got me and then when the holy ghost gets you the burdens the yoke is easy then you pick up the big gates of gaza and pack them straight to california god sure and i feel like running from the front to the back of this church glory to god you pick up your parents and what you do with them you don't take them home you don't take them to your bed and lay there and ponder and worry all night you pick up the big gates of castle and you pack them straight to calvary and there on mount calvary you lay them at the feet of jesus and pray for your enemies not with the grudge lord if you'd bust him open no there was something within your heart that dear god that man is a man like i am you see what's lacking in the church fred are we going to possess these gates the gates of rejection when you think people don't like you well i know that the church speaks to me nobody know before long that thing becomes so rotten it pollutes you come on why don't you pack that up to the hill not hebron but calvary why don't you unload that thing tonight it'll break you brother it'll break your sister to break you my friend's dreaming you can't pack a load like this long we're only ordained by the day to carry these types of loads a very short distance from where i got it to calvary that's all i've got to carry and if i can learn to carry it there it did amazing i unload my my burden and i pray for those who trespass against me when i unload and when i walk away i feel so much better i feel different they may not like me anymore they may hate me worse they may talk about me more they may run me down worse than they've ever run me down but i laid the load of it at calvary and i walk back down off it here can you imagine samson when he finally got them big gates up and just the rabbis say those gates were 60 cubits wide 90 feet 90 feet wide can you imagine seeing a little shrimp with like a double wide trailer on his back well i'm woking up the king's highway oh walking up the cube and here he goes he's just going up the hill the whole time he ain't stopping to take a breath he's dancing he's rejoicing under the anointing of the holy ghost imagine when he got up and just said i'm tired of packing this whole thing and then he comes to himself what in the world whoa do we have a meeting tonight wow was that church or what and he come to himself out of the world did that get there oh lord children if you can only see what god wants to do with an ox code what god can do with shrimps but some of you want to be lobsters let's be shrimps let god energize you then when that devil gets near god will let your lobster claw go out [Applause] don't you see why satan wants to trouble us so much sickness heartache trouble he said get our minds off of this he don't want us to know who we are get us under the fear and the trauma hey this is what the rest of the world is under they're scared to death my their political team don't win they go all to pieces they go all the pieces oh no oh no what are we going to do aren't you glad your faith is not in washington d.c aren't you glad your faith is not in the rnc and the dnc and all the rest them emcees and whatever more they are my faith is not there my faith is up here hallelujah hallelujah let's pray together praise god brother donnie i'm nobody i'm nothing my family background's bad you don't know i i mess up so many times and i've done this and that and the other wow sounds like you got the credentials of a hero to me the prophet said if you ever make it to heaven you will stand beside people that were so weak you see we have this image in our mind of what they were a lot of these images in our mind are hollywood images they're not images of truth moses was not a great eloquent man he was a man that couldn't help pain and made his other incongruent words out right elijah a man of a high temper look at a man like samson the issues and problems that man had and the miracles that god used him for have never been replicated to this day but he knew he was chosen of god well if he could do that without even living a godly life but based upon knowing he was chosen what about us the saints of god john said if you know that your heart don't condemn you then we know we have what we ask him for there's no condemnation in our hearts so we believe him we trust him and we have confidence when we pray i may like to be remembered tonight maybe some of you aren't sick you don't really have any pressing needs or issues but you just like to be the type of person you've heard preached in it not a great person in your eyes but if god can do something for you you see the way to be great is to see yourself as nothing and always remain little in your own eyes as long as we're big in our own eyes we'll never amount to nothing that's right the prophet said god has a hard time trying to find a man that he can use because he said for many men once it goes to using them they want to be an angel or a god before the people but he said if he can find somebody he can use and the more he uses him the littler he gets i'll never forget years and years ago when we was over in this building now before some of you all even came here which is now the fellowship hall people were standing at the end of the service like this brother johnson was standing there the johnson family was coming down from virginia i'm sure that they had moved down here at that time but brother lester johnson the father many of you never got to meet him great brother and when i started quoting that quote brother johnson just stood there by the west and i said quoted what brother braham said the more god uses him the littler he gets and brother johnson went like this and the more he uses him the littler he gets and just kept on going down until his knees hit the floor or if we can get little in our own house just take our little walks goat or our left hand or our hammer and nail or our piece of millstone whatever it is then let the lord energize us and then we'll look back like samson and say wow wow what a place we've been in today what a service we've had awesome if we can be nothing and stay nothing let's pray together heavenly father who were we tonight that we would be invited by the great mighty king to be part of your army in the last day i look around our ranks here tonight and our ranks around the world we're not great we're not mighty many of us aren't very smart probably wouldn't be one doctor's degree among us certainly in our theology many of us are poor we'd be embarrassed to be invited to the white house to speak we wouldn't know how to talk we'd be embarrassed to eat with the mayor maybe or the governor of the state because our manners would be support and yet we're invited to eat with the king of kings and the lord of lords praise god lord maybe all we have tonight in our hands is an ox goat now that must have been a miraculous thing we know it was because shamgar had used this thing for years to plow and who would have ever thought you'd have ever taken that as an implement of war a sword a spear armor or something like that but an ox goad which is a farmer's implement a tool well lord if you could use a farmer's tool what about a wife's tool a frying pan that if she stands there and fixes her husband and her children breakfast and supper and it's made with not only ingredients of salt and pepper and eggs and this and that and the other but
