[0:00] light is there pulsating making it
[0:02] visible for you and you don't have to
[0:04] say no wait a minute ma'am let me flip
[0:05] my switch here let me turn this on turn
[0:07] this off you know you don't do that it's
[0:09] cosmic rays that God put in you so a
[0:13] part of the heavens is in your natural
[0:18] makeup glory be to God that's Cosmic
[0:22] light that's in you that you're made up
[0:25] of full of light cells now that's mic
[0:30] light but God is different light but yet
[0:34] he's light so God is Not Cosmic light
[0:38] but eternal light of course now think of
[0:40] the picture there's a great proof of
[0:42] what I'm fixing to say that God is light
[0:44] and when we're walking in light of God
[0:46] as sons of God God's not Cosmic light
[0:49] but God's life operated through the
[0:53] cosmic light of our
[0:56] bodies our cells
[1:00] so you've got light meters sitting in
[1:02] you this morning your cells have light
[1:06] coming through
[1:08] them glory to
[1:10] God and when we're absolutely at one
[1:14] time real genuine sons of God now can
[1:17] you imagine what it's going to be
[1:19] whenever we get past this Mortal body
[1:22] Lord Jesus them saints of God this
[1:25] morning that are in that sixth Dimension
[1:27] everything is so bright so brilliant
[1:30] everybody that I've heard from as far as
[1:31] around the message of they are whether
[1:33] they had a a vision or dream or whatever
[1:35] it was and they went beyond the curtain
[1:37] of time none of them talked about
[1:39] Shadows none of them talked about
[1:41] Darkness none of them talked about weary
[1:44] sadness but it was so bright the yellows
[1:47] are so yellow the blues are so blue the
[1:49] greens were so green and it was like the
[1:51] light was so brilliant far beyond
[1:53] anything that' ever seen in this life if
[1:56] we could have a glimpse this morning
[1:58] into the sixth dimension where our loved
[2:00] ones are and they are running and
[2:03] praising God and worshiping God and the
[2:06] light is shining all around them no more
[2:08] sickness no more heartache no more
[2:11] trouble and that Dimension is just 20
[2:14] feet from where we are this morning and
[2:17] what's the message of the hour going to
[2:19] do it's going to take us to that
[2:28] world now watch what analogy that he
[2:30] uses here like a
[2:33] seaweed that you get in the bottom of
[2:35] the sea and a lot of times divers
[2:37] they'll get under these seaweeds and
[2:39] before they know it they're wrapped in
[2:41] such a way they can't get out of it well
[2:43] that's the way sin has done the human
[2:46] being that's the way
[2:48] coldness has done the church that's the
[2:52] way
[2:53] communist has done the nation it's so
[2:56] treacherous then in the human body
[3:00] it wrapped us and is pushing out this
[3:05] light of God by denominations and
[3:09] denying faith and so forth It's pushed
[3:11] out all the
[3:14] Rays of God's great power of
[3:19] Faith now we're not talking about the
[3:22] four light rays that you've got in your
[3:23] natural body that's in yourself that's
[3:25] in there whether you believe it or not
[3:28] but here we're talking about raise of
[3:30] God's Supernatural power that can be
[3:33] hindered if you don't believe
[3:36] it now people say I don't believe in no
[3:39] lot in my body I don't believe it I'm
[3:41] going to the X-ray but it won't show up
[3:42] on me yes it will show up them whether
[3:44] they believe it or don't believe it but
[3:46] when we're talking about the power of
[3:48] God our faith must be aligned with his
[3:53] promise Oh Glory to
[3:56] God it's all pushed out those rays and
[3:59] such a place till we've got to a
[4:02] lodge and now below the
[4:05] lodge the church is cuz it's just pushed
[4:09] all the darkness
[4:11] out even just saying it doesn't happen
[4:15] denying that it could happen see the
[4:20] miracles of
[4:22] god how can I not believe in
[4:25] miracles I am
[4:27] one how can you not believe in Miracles
[4:30] you're born again today you are
[4:32] one we got many people sitting right
[4:35] here in this building today would not be
[4:36] alive where not for a miracle of God
[4:39] sparing their life it'd be a sin for us
[4:42] to disbelieve his promises now
[4:45] Saints now once God knew no we know four
[4:49] is the number of Earthly Deliverance I
[4:51] know four is not one of our favorite
[4:52] numbers I know that we're like threes
[4:54] fives sevens 40s and 50s but four is a
[4:57] very important number when it comes to
[5:02] Deliverance because four is the number
[5:05] of Earthly Deliverance the force man in
[5:08] the fire and the force light and the
[5:11] force for Life Messengers that God was
[5:15] going to use to restore this body listen
[5:19] this in the restoration of the Bride
[5:20] tree I I'll have an Easter of
[5:22] Resurrection for the bride the same as I
[5:25] had for the bridegroom even in lights
[5:28] come to shine the same as in the morning
[5:30] same signs same thing that same light
[5:35] will produce the same
[5:37] fruit they had there it's shining on the
[5:41] same tree amen proves his
[5:44] word now fulfilled I will
[5:49] restore says the Lord I don't believe it
[5:52] don't matter whether you believe it or
[5:54] not he'll still do
[5:56] it that was four
[6:00] four deaths
[6:03] Messengers that kill that
[6:06] tree is that right what was it
[6:08] palmerworm Locust
[6:10] cankerworm
[6:12] caterpillar four messengers of Roman
[6:15] Devils dogmas killed that tree one took
[6:19] its fruit one took its bark or took its
[6:23] leaves one took the bark and the other
[6:27] one took its life
[6:30] and he takes all these if you haven't
[6:31] listened to this in a while he takes all
[6:34] these and describes what they are the
[6:37] leaves was them clapping their
[6:40] hands you see it takes a real
[6:42] consecrated child of God in the age that
[6:45] we're living to be able to still worship
[6:47] God when things are going against you
[6:50] but if Satan can steal your praise he's
[6:54] done got you whipped I don't care how
[6:56] much you intellectually believe in the
[6:58] word of God of the
[7:00] how much you come to church you can be
[7:01] as faithful as you can be and sit there
[7:03] like a bump on a pickle God wants you to
[7:06] praise him when you're up he wants you
[7:08] to praise him and you're down he wants
[7:10] you to raise your hands he wants you to
[7:12] clap your hands he wants you to say amen
[7:16] that's what we do as children of
[7:20] God my goodness people go to a soccer
[7:23] game or a ball game or a baseball game
[7:26] or a football game they'll sat out there
[7:29] before long it'll be cold of winter
[7:31] they'll sit out there with them football
[7:33] games my goodness and they'll nearly
[7:34] freeze to death and they'll sit right
[7:36] there and jump up and down and Hunter
[7:38] and scream and we go to the house of God
[7:41] and hardly even bat our eye we ought to
[7:43] be ashamed of ourselves we ought to have
[7:46] such a Jubilation of joy down inside of
[7:50] us if people can Rejoice over a home run
[7:53] if they can Rejoice over a ball game my
[7:57] how ought we to rejoice in the presence
[8:00] of almighty
[8:07] God glory
[8:09] glory now watch four
[8:13] messengers of dogmas kill the
[8:16] tree all but the
[8:18] roots and the four messengers of Death
[8:21] kill the tree four messengers of
[8:26] Life
[8:27] restores the tree

[8:31] say five
[8:38] or I mean that's about how many we've
[8:40] had ain't we in the message we just keep
[8:42] having
[8:44] them no they're not messengers of Life
[8:47] they're
[8:51] Liars no God sent Noble preacher out to
[8:56] the prophet of God to tell us what he
[8:57] meant that's right God sent no Apostle
[9:00] soall to bring Clarity to the message
[9:03] that's a lie straight from the pits of
[9:05] hell you get the baptism of the Holy
[9:08] Ghost and set under A God Called man
[9:10] you're going to get the clarity you need
[9:12] as a matter of fact you're going to get
[9:13] enough that it's going to change your
[9:15] body one of these days we don't need
[9:17] another Prophet we don't need somebody
[9:19] else to replace Malachi for we need
[9:22] Christians that are filled with the Holy
[9:24] Ghost who love this word and they're
[9:27] feeding on that word and they won't put
[9:29] up with
[9:36] it notice four messengers of Life
[9:40] restores the tree do you get it amen for
[9:44] God said I will restore he's going to
[9:48] restore it how four death Messengers
[9:51] killed it four life
[9:54] Messengers will restore it what was the
[9:58] first mark Mar
[10:00] Luther justification we still believe in
[10:04] justification what was the second John
[10:06] Wesley
[10:08] by we still believe in
[10:10] sanctification sanctification what was
[10:13] the third Pentecost with a restoration

[10:21] was the
[10:23] fce the word what the word
[10:30] am can't you see why those who just want
[10:34] to stick then with
[10:37] Lutheranism or westernism or even
[10:41] Pentecost they're missing light
[10:45] rays so the Lutheran oh we're going in
[10:47] the Rapture praise God God used Martin
[10:49] Luther yes he did but God sent three
[10:51] more light rays after Luther God sent
[10:54] two more after W Oh Glory to God I'm a

[10:59] shout I believe in all of that too but
[11:01] that's only the third light Ray that's
[11:04] only the third messenger we need four
[11:08] because four is the number of Earthly
[11:12] deliverance and this is what we're
[11:14] waiting for Earthly
[11:17] Deliverance oh my notice there were four
[11:21] great prophets one of them Martin Luther

[16:46] every one of these s these moves these
[16:48] lights the life moved through
[16:50] justification the life moved through
[16:52] sanctification the life moves through
[16:53] the the Pentecost but people w't take
[16:55] the real Pentecost and say trash the
[16:57] whole thing you're not taking my le
[17:01] leaves I said you're not taking my
[17:04] leaves I may go through hard times

[17:09] got to struggle and I just put my hands
[17:10] up and I can't even wave I
[17:15] just oh brother going through a low spot
[17:18] but it's only a low spot I Won't Say I'm
[17:20] a leafy
[17:22] fell I said I'm a leafy fell God called
[17:26] me when he called me to worship him I
[17:28] hope you don't get mad at me if you do

[17:39] I'm talking about big old
[17:41] [Applause]
[17:46] leaves glory to God sh have gness some
[17:49] man that could eat gunpowder instead of
[17:50] black pepper said have a little bit of
[17:52] leaves on his
[17:55] tree notice the force
[17:59] was the word
[18:01] itself the
[18:02] [Applause]
[18:08] word do you believe this made
[18:15] flesh
[18:16] fruits of the proof of the
[18:19] Resurrection sign that Christ has
[18:23] finally after justification being
[18:25] planted sanctification being planted
[18:27] baptism of the oran ations died out and
[18:30] Christ
[18:32] again centered
[18:34] himself like the
[18:37] cap of the
[18:41] pyramid the Lord Jesus ain't just going
[18:43] to set himself on the top of the church
[18:45] ages he wants to cap you
[18:50] off first line justification
[18:53] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[18:56] then the coming of the cap what is it
[18:59] the Holy Ghost Bunch being honed out so
[19:01] it can fit with the same kind of
[19:05] ministry he had when he went
[19:11] away
[19:12] Lord so those the Capstone will sit down
[19:15] upon will have the same type of ministry
[19:18] that he had when he went away and he
[19:20] left them tapes to play right he left
[19:23] them books to read I surely there
[19:25] wouldn't be no man's Tes brother random
[19:27] included that would be be more profound
[19:29] than the Lord
[19:32] Jesus so God could have used him and and
[19:34] recorded every word he ever wanted to
[19:36] say from that time on for 2,000 years
[19:38] and said don't need no more preachers at
[19:40] all this is my voice literally on tape
[19:43] so we just push
[19:49] that glory to
[19:52] God but he's coming back after the same
[19:54] type of ministry he had that when he
[19:58] comes
[19:59] it'll catch the whole
[20:01] thing don't you understand the pulp the
[20:05] bark the leaves those that the life pass
[20:08] through that makes this mystical brid
[20:13] tree oh my brother D poor old rer he he
[20:16] won't be there he will be there Wesley
[20:19] will be there and the real genuine
[20:21] westons they'll be right there in the
[20:23] resurrection them real genuine
[20:25] Pentecostals that have the spirit of God
[20:27] they'll be right there
[20:29] amen but it takes the fourth light from
[20:31] the Capstone shining down and permeates
[20:34] down through the re the whole sides of
[20:38] the whole body of the pyramid to reach
[20:41] down under the pyramid and pull them out
[20:44] of the ground and say come on let's go
[20:46] to heaven come on oh Hallelujah the
[20:51] spirit of God will come from the top
[20:54] down and go down in the heart of the
[20:56] earth my some of them have been eat
[20:58] eaten by the Lions their bodies were
[21:00] thrown in the sea there's not even one
[21:03] Speck of dust left but the power that
[21:06] God will restore by the force light will
[21:09] take the whole body and engulf it and
[21:14] reach down and pull them up and say come
[21:16] on
[21:19] children come up
[21:22] higher there will go the pulp and there
[21:25] will go the bark and there will go the
[21:26] leaves and there will go the light
[21:29] the whole resurrected body of Jesus
[21:38] Christ
[21:41] oh so that it can fit with the same kind
[21:44] of ministry he had when he went away
[21:47] that when he comes back it'll catch the
[21:50] whole thing and the Rapture whe they
[21:53] Justified Sanctified baptism of the Holy
[21:55] Ghost that pyramid will stand again in
[21:59] the house of God prise lord the house of
[22:05] God will live
[22:08] again the tree of
[22:10] life is
[22:13] growing

[22:22] at the coming oh then the evening light
[22:26] of Malachi

[23:51] glorify who you the preacher the church
[23:55] glorify your father which is in heaven
[23:58] St John 12:36 we read it or just read it
[24:01] again while you have light believe in
[24:04] the light that you may be the children
[24:07] of light these are not our words we're
[24:10] not trying to separate people ourself
[24:12] and say well if they don't believe that
[24:14] this is the words of the Lord Jesus if
[24:17] you're going in the Rapture you've got
[24:19] to be a children of the evening light
[24:23] cannot wear the brand of a denomination
[24:26] and be a virgin born bride at the same
[24:28] time and the church said Ephesians 5:8
[24:32] listen it's you for ye were sometimes
[24:36] Darkness but now but now are ye light in
[24:42] the Lord walk as children of light we
[24:47] were like the Earth and it was Darkness
[24:50] all around us but we ain't darkness no
[24:52] more we may have our trials we may have
[24:55] our test we may have difficulties that
[24:58] we go through but because you're going
[25:01] through a dark time don't mean you're a
[25:03] child of Darkness you are a child of
[25:06] light but it's night time around your
[25:08] life but joy is coming in the
[25:12] morning the sun will come
[25:20] up thank you Lord first Thessalonians
[25:23] 5:5 you are all the children of light
[25:27] and the children Children of the day we
[25:30] are not of the night nor of Darkness

[30:40] quote out of that one quote from that
[30:43] one brother come all the scriptures and
[30:45] all these quotes today it's amazing how
[30:48] God can do that to me I just marvel at
[30:51] it the way he does it and I was just in
[30:52] a few minutes in the presence of God
[30:54] like it was an explosion one after
[30:56] another after another and the Lord
[30:58] dropped all this down there and I just
[30:59] thought oh my
[31:02] Lord how great he is you know what
[31:04] happened to me right then the light
[31:07] struck my soul and gave me
[31:10] inspiration for this
[31:12] today so may the same spirit of God
[31:15] strike your soul and give you what you
[31:18] have need of healing the light is
[31:22] here what you said what do you mean

[31:36] could tell you you ain't got but a few
[31:37] hours to live your oxygen your
[31:39] respiration every bit of it's gone they
[31:42] said if God revealed it to you you'd
[31:44] laugh in that doctor's
[31:46] face I shared the quote the other day
[31:48] with someone here at the church where
[31:50] the Prophet said if you had cancer and
[31:52] if you didn't fear it he said you
[31:54] wouldn't be in too bad a shape and just
[31:56] the mention of the word can in this day
[31:58] terrifies people right but remember
[32:02] there will be many that God in his
[32:05] wisdom God and his wisdom knew it would
[32:07] come but he'll use them to display his
