sodomites are maturing the whole thing is maturing so is the elect of God praise the lord well isn't it wonderful to be in church again tonight thank the Lord heard you all had a good service here on Sunday appreciate brother Joe taking the service and um the Lord helped us up up in Virginia brother Timothy and brother Tim did an awesome job that other guy y'all know how I feel about him I don't care much about him he's never been one of my favorite preachers you know uh I don't like him and he really don't like me but anyway but the anyway the other two brothers done a really good job really good job we so so enjoyed being there with them Fellowship of the Lord um let's turn to Jeremiah tonight chapter 5 verse 24 if you would Lord willing tomorrow night we'll be having question answers for our youth of course we'll be streaming for those of you that are too old to meet the age limit I believe it'll be a blessing to you you just pray for us that the Lord will help us and be with us and I know you're praying for the needs of um uh our church family several different ones going through some pretty difficult times right now we're just asking for the mercy of God and the miraculous of God yeah some still recovering from covid and this and that and the other so just keep them on your heart if you would we know that our God Specializes in Supernatural things does he know as a matter of fact I shared a quote with brother Tim and brother Ron the other day where the Prophet talked about omnipotence when omnipotence speaks the miraculous happens it has to he said when omnipotent speak so when two omnipotence join together you know who those two are you you and God oh my I didn't say that I'm just repeating what the messenger said when those two join together oh my what can happen so we believe it right we believe our God can do it Jeremiah chapter 5: 24 neither say they in their heart let us now fear the lord Our God that give us rain both the former and the latter rain in his season he reserve unto us the appointed weeks of harvest Hosea 6:3 then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and former Reign unto the earth now what a strange thing that Hosea says that the Lord will actually come as a latter and the former ring together now if you've been looking at any of this and if you've looked in the message you probably have run across this already that the prophet also likened the former Reign to the Apostles and he likened the latter Reign to the restoration of the apostolic Doctrine and the coming of the Lord Jesus the merging of the former which was the apostolic teaching and the presence of the Lord Jesus himself Joel 2:23 be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God how many believes we ought to rejoice in the Lord yes sir does anybody know of any Scripture where the Bible says be sad in the Lord your God be mournful be depressed in the Lord your God no it doesn't say it does it but it says rejoice in the Lord your God for he has given you the former Reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month of course the word former there in the Hebrew is Mor which means teaching so God will cause the teaching Reign to come and then he will cause the latter rain to come which will produce or finish the crop I believe we're in that hour amen I me' like to be remembered today want to say how happy we are to see brother Wade and sister Anna back in service with us tonight bless their hearts have been going through some real difficult times and and their body fighting different things but we're just thankful the Lord's helped him to be able to be here tonight and may has a need in your heart a request all right let's just go before the Lord Lord Jesus it's such an honor for us to be able to be gathered together again tonight in the house of God we thank you Lord for every time that you've allowed us to come and everything that you've done when we've assembled here Lord Jesus we're just believing you for another visitation of your presence tonight all these hands that were uplifted signified needs requests desires some of them impossible for us to be able to take care of on our own we need Divine and intervention Lord you know some in our church family are facing some real difficult things in their bodies and as our brothers and sisters our hearts hurt for them Lord so we pray that you'd be mindful of each one tonight Lord some may be are well physically but they're dealing with other things or having marital problems or financial troubles maybe troubles on their job some of our children maybe troubles in school and some of the older ones troubles and college and whatever it is Lord we just bring them all to you father we're also asking you tonight for your nation Israel you see where they are father you see all the things that's going on they're they're under attack on every side and seems like that the leaders of the nation no matter what decisions they make that it cannot be the right one but we pray that you'd be mindful of them tonight father I'm also asking you Lord for brother Dwight Hall many of our people know brother Dwight he's come and sang for us and been a blessing to many people around the message and brother Daryl had mentioned to me that he' been sick before the service so I text him and his his heart function got down to about 15% he said and uh fluid and is still in the hospital and Lord he requested that we would pray together so Lord God we bring our brother to you tonight in the name of Jesus may this leave his body Satan you are a liar you are defeated go from our brother in the name of Jesus Christ speak to us tonight father your word we ask in the name of the Living Word the Lord Jesus and the saints of God said amen amen God bless you you may be seated so glad to see you tonight I always enjoy going out and preaching at other churches and being with other people but I always enjoy home ain't no place like home are they I so appreciate each of you love you with all my heart uh I I believe that we are living in the Harvest cycle of the end time and we know that truly this is not the first end time but it's the only one quite like this there was an end time in the anti luian destruction there was an end time in 557 BC whenever Nebuchadnezzar had come in and carried the children of Israel captive there's been several different end times under the Persian Kingdom as well and under the time of the macbes under the time of the Romans and it would end an era or a dispensation but we believe that we are living in an end time which is totally different than any that's ever been on the earth before because after every one of those errors there was a rising or a Reviving again and people would regroup and people would have a Revival and God would do great things for them and then they would go back into that cycle again but we believe that we're at the end to where there is no re Revival from this one here as a matter of fact one day The Mercy Seat will become Smoky and the blood will be lifted and the purchase of the blood will be taken from the earth and when that happens we know there'll be no more Gentiles that'll be saved alas they'll still make alter calls it'll be some of the biggest alter calls the world has ever seen people will be screaming and crying it will will break force and what Many religious people will deem to be one of the greatest revivals the world has ever known but not one of them will actually be getting saved because The Mercy Seat is vacated so if you want to be saved and you want to be in you better get in while the getting's good because it won't be long the door of Mercy will be closed and we know that every thing that we are seeing and what is in the future yet to be comes from previous seed times that have been upon the earth now we know that from reading in the Book of Genesis and we can see from the way that God caught Moses back into that revelated spot where he was and he wrote and said in Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth period and then in verse two and the Earth was without form and void and darkness covered the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon there and God said let there be light and there was light but there was a great span of time that had taken place between verse one and verse two and we can see by what what Jeremiah described and Ezekiel in in a faint way that there was something that had come upon the Earth and had brought a darkness and a chaos God never leaves anything by creation in such a state so we know that something had happened a pre-adamite world to where that Lucifer had come down on the earth and and wanted to have this earth that is his own possession and then the prophet said when God said let there be light he said I do do not believe that the Sun the moon and the stars come into existence when he said that but they were already in existence but God simply drove back the darkness that had come upon the Earth So what had brought the darkness upon the Earth that had hidden what God had created so God had already created the Sun the moon the stars and the universe and every said uh created the heavens and the Earth and then something had come upon and a Darkness overshadowed the Earth and it kept the moon the Sun and all all the universal lights from being able to penetrate on the earth so God simply said let there be light or in other words Let There Be The Darkness that will draw itself together in phases and then God call the light day and the Darkness he called night so when God gave the darkness a name and he gave the the light a name if you notice he doesn't call the light Sun or the light moon or the light stars but he calls the light day and he calls the darkness night so he's dispensation giving it a Time by which you'll know and be able to divide it so when you look out and you see the sun then you can know what well it's daylight it's daytime when you look out you see the moon and the stars you know that it is not how do you know that by the measure of the light that is being shined so God then was showing a pattern in that he was writing his future forecast of the Bible and the prophet said whenever God begin to bring them seeds out I believe that those seeds he said were laying there from some former or some previous civilization so where was that from had already made that now aons of Ages prior to verse two and then the spirit of God simply caused the darkness to congeal together and separate the light from the day and then God drove the waters back because the waters had covered over the face of the Earth and what God was doing was riding out the shadow of your election and he said it's a type third seal a type of the human being so God didn't actually put them seeds there they were already there and the Darkness and the the the M moisture and the vapor that was upon the face of the Earth the seeds could not grow there was no light for it to be able to penetrate so God by his spoken word separated light from Darkness separated wet from dry and then God be to humidify the Earth and bring the the earth into where the expanse of the water and God Drew part of it up this way and part of it God gathered in The Fountains of the deep so God began to drain the Earth and then he brought it up here in this great expanse to be used later and he would call it vapor and moisture and then he would create this other and he would cause great drains off the face of the Earth and it would be this great Fountains of the deep which would be held in reserve for the an delu and destruction so God separated and what he did automatically then those seeds that were laying there they began to grow and they took off so that was a type of you and I now whenever then God started right there in the Book of Genesis so Genesis is the seed book or seed chapter of the entire Bible so everything God's going to do is mirrored from Genesis so if we are living in the last day of the Harvest cycle then we know there had to be a sewing cycle just makes sense right so whenever we sewed this field right over here and brother Aaron and the brothers that worked for him and they got out there and they sewed and sewed way up into the around midnight hours and they sewed and sewed and then it come some rain and there was some of the seed that didn't come up some of it washed away so I started going over there and buying hundreds and hundreds of pounds of Kentucky 31 Fescue and I started sewing and sewing and and sewing and then we go into the dry spot of Summer and it looked as if though almost all of that seed that I SED that none of it would live some of it come up and it died back I sewed this bank over here this one back here I've sold all over everywhere cuz I hate bare spots and I hate be spots in Christians lives because I know they got fertile ground and if I can keep raking it and sewing it then embarassed spots in your life I want to look out there and see you totally covered over cuz you got spots there it's fertile ground in your life but it can be more than fertile ground it can bring forth what the seed wants it to be you understand so I thought by looking at this field over here that most of that seed that I had planted was totally wasted but I've sewed grass seed for a long long time and I know it can lay there and seemingly nothing happened to it but whenever we started getting the rains back a month or so ago and what I noticed was and I was over here today and Seed some more back over here yesterday and I noticed that a lot of those seeds that I'd sewn actually come up now it seemed as if though there wasn't going to do it but what I realized was those seeds had laid there dormant now they were dormant because the proper amount of moisture had not germinated them and they would lay there so I found it out years ago if you can sew the seed high enough even if it washes it'll work its way down and some of it will Lodge here and there and there and the fils for sure will come and pick some of it up but all it takes is for it to be able to Lodge just a little bit and if it gets enough moisture it will germinate and it'll come forth y'all ought to be shouting I preached about you just then now the devil thought some of you all were helpless and hopeless and maybe you thought you were too but God knew there was a seed there that was laying dormant and if it could get you under the right ministry under the right atmosphere and the right church and the right environment where the spirit of God was moving he knew that you'd come forth for and bring force in this hour now it's the same with what God had to do in the age to where it was a great seed time now there were three main planters that was on the earth in the era behind where where we are right now now for some of our Elder people here they were alive during this era that I wish to speak about tonight which was in the 40s 50s and 60s and tapered on out around the 70s and there was one main head planter that main head planter in the religious realm was Billy Graham now Billy Graham was a great head planter now don't look funny at me because I've got a quote that says this so Billy Graham was the head planter now Oral Roberts was also a another planter but he was sewing a different type of seed to a different type of people and then there was Elijah now watch the prophet said there's been three different kinds of seeds planted a denomination will be the Graham he was a head planter or Roberts for the Pentecostal Pentecostal seeds been planted isn't that amazing that brother Brandon does not identify himself as sewing Pentecostal sea brother bham was not the SE of ausa seat isusa Street seed he was the S of the restoration of the original Pentecost now notice he does not identify himself as being the planter of the isusa street style of seed that was Oral Roberts Oral Roberts for the Pentecostal Pentecostal seeds been planted I'm talking about organization now and then the words been planted on down in this same paragraph here he said seeds must be planted then the water falls to water the sea now we're hearing so much he says about uh many organizations and everything else they talk about and we're in the lighter rain nonsense we're in the latter rain nonsense now what's absolutely amazing is that brother brandom himself in the 50s and on up to 1960 said the light of rain was falling now you see this is one of the things a lot of the message folks have absolutely hated about me is that I see that brother brandham allowed God to let him grow and change in certain things of what he believed now if you make him God then of course you can't believe that but that also makes you an idolator and that means that deity demon has got a hold to you you remember that snake that he stood in the middle of and struck it and you remember that demon was so powerful that it bit him but the blood was so rich it wouldn't take effect it wasn't Brandon blood it's evident it was Jesus blood can you imagine a man that deity spirit being so strong if any of us if anybody knows our weakness and our mistakes it's us but that deity devil was so strong that it even actually attacked the prophet if anybody would know his Humanity it was him but what kept Him from it the blood of the Lord Jesus Brandon blood ain't rich raikan blood ain't Rich come on somebody Smith's blood or whatever your name is our blood ain't no good but the blood of Jesus will keep us from that deity devil well praise the Lord now watch what what he goes on to say now remember this is spoken words Original Seed 1962 it is over a 6 hour sermon he goes into the Tabernacle and he starts on Sunday morning and he preaches for several hours then he and the people break they go have lunch and they come back he picks up where he left off and he preached for several more hours wound up being over a 6-hour sermon now if you haven't listened to it in a long time it do you good I know most of us we ain't got enough patience to sit down and listen to No six-h hour sermon but if you got to break it up do it you'll get a lot out of it I guarantee you now it's so amazing because when he starts preaching this God actually lets him move into the realm of vision while he's preaching it so while he's preaching a vision starts passing before his eyes now I know it's unusual for most of us I've only had a few Visions in my life and I I wouldn't called to live in that realm and I'm sure most of you were not but even though he was it still just alarmed him when it would happen now watch he himself would not become so set in his ways that he could not preach something and then allow God to further his understanding and his Revelation now check me out on this I want you to I expect you to and you looking 56 you're looking 5 9 you look in 60 and brother R says that the lighter rain is pouring out right now it's falling right now but whenever God starts dealing with him about this seed time and harvest and then he makes this comment that were in the lighter rain nonsense no such a thing something's happening now watch here he breaks into Vision so he's preaching and then all of us sudden this Vision starts happening he said something's happening I can just see it passing before me it's I I it's done caught the spirit you already hear him on tape Caroline I heard this the other day as we were coming home from the meetings in Virginia he said done CAU the spirit amen I I know this is the truth it's thus saith the Lord by Vision just moving and coming now remember now now we have Vision I know it makes it so difficult for people because you know they look at the message of the hour they land no progression they do not allow the prophet to be able to grow in his understanding and so on so they look and say well he said this year and he said that well of course he was a man just like the rest of us just like the prophet when he stood there and told the king he's going to die that's all he knew how to do thus said the Lord set your house in order you're going to die and not live and the spirit of God heard that King's cry you remember it in the Bible and what did he do God stopped him out on the outer Court turned him right back around and go and go back in thus sayith the Lord you going to live well which one of them is right come on somebody prophets can only say what they see at the time that's all they know how to do and then whenever God will give them further understanding than they can do it I can personally follow a man like that I cannot follow the man-made William brandham that people in this message have made because they make him without fault they make him without flaw that is not the William brandom that he himself projected come on somebody he was just like Moses he was just like Jeremiah he was just like Ezekiel come on he was a human being and he was man enough to stand up and tell us when he was wrong and when he preached this differently than that oh yeah I can follow a man like that so many how many preachers today will do that show many how many Talent evangelists will do that show many how many preachers in the message will even do it now but this is the type of man that God wanted to be able to use now watch so he breaks into the real a vision while he's preaching about these three seed types so he said by Vision SE just moving and coming can't hardly get looked down watch watch how his senses now are breaking because remember vision is the realm of the fourth dimension so you're partially there and yet you're partially here in time like you would have a dream and you're coming out of the dream and y'all done that have a dream and you don't know if you're asleep or you're awake and you know maybe your wife's shaking you honey wake up wake up it was a nightmare it was a nightmare so you know you don't know where you are so here he is he's standing out in the Pulpit he's preaching and he's he just he's in the vision and he's out of the vision y' ought to listen to it and just hear how he says it can't Harley looked down here every time I look I see it just moving up in front of me like that and breaking off and move this way and look this way so it was just passing right in front of him now what's going on down a bit he said all right let let's go back and try it again so while he's preaching he goes into the realm of vision and then he loses his thought of preaching oh Lord it must have been absolutely awesome and yet he he kind of going back and forth and then he regroups and the vision passes before him and then he says now let's let's let's try it again now I I I'm sure I got it in there I I don't know exactly what happened along that line I don't know exactly what happened along that line now why you say brother brandom there's been I I know right now now Watch What Happens catching your salt now you see you can't hide it now all right so be careful what you're thinking so here we have God wanted to make sure this in the spoken words Original Seed would be so accurate that he moves his Prophet into the realm of vision now most of the time when he's preaching it's two separate anointings from preaching to the realm of vision as far as seeing things but one what happened another occasion that my comes to my mind right now was that it was in maybe I don't remember if North Dakota South Dakota but it was in the 50s and he actually at the end of his sermon he preached a little bit about Adam and he saw Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden and he saw Adam come to his wife and it it it so tore him up at the end of that service and the very next night he comes back and it was so memorable to him that again he mentions it before the people and he said he saw Adam actually walk out of the Garden of Eden with his wife now most of the time it would be two separate whms but on the occasion the Lord would allow it like he did here so he would break forth from these Dimensions these first three that we all know so well and then he would break Force into the realm of the force but it's almost near the impossibility to keep your mind straight apparently I don't know cuz I ain't never been there but but it must be really hard because a part of you is leaving your senses and you're pulling away into the Heavenly realm so he had to kind of come back and you know get it together again but now watch it leaves the vision disappears before his eyes but it still leaves him partially in that realm to where people were thinking things about what he was preaching now he said you know he's preaching about the former Reign and the latter rain so we went through it last time we dealt with this how that the former rain would come for a couple of months to break up the ground because the ground was hard and crusty and dry and the former rain would fall upon the ground and soft it and moisten it up and break up the fow ground then they would plant the seed and then there would be several months of dry weather so he someone had thought this while he was preaching it and he says catching your thought now you see you just can't hide it now all right so be careful what you're thinking now the seed must be planted and then it must have water in order to grow now you say well brother brandom I'm going to express your thoughts so for those Kneads called preachers around this message that think they know more about God than God's Vindicated Prophet I'd like to tell you you're a one dumb outfit as a matter of fact you ain't got no sense even being in the Pulpit well come on somebody help me get out this hole I'm digging in now I'll tell you one thing I I I I'm totally convinced we got all kinds of preachers around this message that shouldn't be preaching a bit more than my wife should be they ain't got no business being the PO you say why would you say that because God's Prophet said question in 1961 if a man claims to be a teacher you want to know if he's called of God or not watch how he interprets the word oh my oh you've got preachers that say they believe the message and they say well and brother brandom said thus sayith the Lord I'll take it but I won't take none of the rest of it who in the world do you think you are who do you think you are that you're going to stand before Elijah oh my goodness come on somebody well I'll tell you one thing and if he said thus sayth the Lord I'll take it I doubt it I doubt it oh my but you know what if it come right down to it I would take his opinion if it was is no more than his opinion over mine or you or anyone else why because he walked in a place with God that none of us have ever been so he say well that's his idea that's his opinion well if it is I'd rather have it than mine cuz I don't figure I know too much and I know you don't if you've got that attitude it knows you've got to know it all attitude which means god ain't going to use you for nothing Well preach Brother D well I think brother Rand didn't know what he's talking about on the gifts and I think brother R didn't know what he's talking about on this and that and who are [Music] you well praise the Lord now watch Catching your thought and this is what he's going to do now so I'm going to express your thoughts on this we've had the water he says so B so apparently somebody was sitting there thinking well what about these revivals that were being called out a ring now remember there might be an occasional shower that will pass through after the initial spring rains and the seed is laying there but that does not qualify as being called the lter rain it would be an occasional shower well we've had them in the message too how many different revivals have come up in the ranks of the message and it would be part of it start out as a genuine move of God part of it didn't it was fake as it could be it was all based on a man's idea nearly every one of them point to some preacher somewhere well come on and they become the Apostle or they become this and that and the other and they're sent to lead us and tell us where brother Brandon was wrong I have no problem in believing when brother brandom said he was wrong but I do have a problem when you got a a knucklehead preacher standing in the pull pit trying to tell us where brother Brandon was wrong I got a problem with that you know why God never sent them to to lead me to heaven but God did send his Vindicated Prophet God never Vindicated me God never Vindicated a lot of these other men well come on let's have church tonight but God did vindicate his messenger amen amen now watch we've had water so be it that's correct you've had the water did you ever plant cabbage or anything or seeds or something other like that and usually you ain't got no water they just pour a little on it so you take a little cabbage plant you pour a little on it and that's what a lot of the revivals and things have been it's been just a little dab of water to where it'll give it a little drink and dry times thank God for every little cup full we've got but if you'll be real honest you know yourself that you go through dry spots your life and you're so thirsty for a good move of God how many knows what I'm talking about and you get so thirsty and God by his grace will come by and give you a little drink give you another little drink thank God thank God but I'm telling you friends the abundance of the rain is right before us and I ain't talking about now a world shaking Revival I ain't talking about God's going to raise up this great man among us and everybody in the message is going to follow this one man nonsense contr to the scripture contrary to the message of the hour but I'll tell you what God is going to do the promised son is the latter ring the promised son is the lighter rain now watch oh my you take the word former and jto and look at it and say in the Hebrew go to the Hebrew and see if it don't you want to write it down he spells it out Moray and you get the Hebrew word in it interpret what Mor means it's teaching the teaching Reign has went forth the denominational teaching Reign has went forth a million more in 44 so that was the saying of some of the denominational people a million more we want a million more converts in 1944 so that was the saying that they got and oh so and so and so members in the church or Roberts and them brothers with the Pentecostal move oh my Pentecostal move the economic or the great Pentecostal move done moved into the millions that's right and the seed the seed has went forth the word for the minority the group I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them so there's three main Planters now we're looking of course mainly in the realm of Christianity so Billy Graham being the head planner or Roberts sewing the Pentecostal seed Brother brandham sewing The Original Seed word now also though at the same time frame socialism seeds are being sown in America communism seeds are being sown in America America so the beetles come from England to America the monkeys and a lot of them people so what seeds were also being sown Elvis Presley the birth of rock and roll now look at during this time frame Ben Graham or Roberts and Elijah Elvis monkeys Beatles uh socialism communism do you understand where we are right here tonight today in 2024 and look at how many politicians that are in Congress and Senate and governors and Mayors and so on it'd probably be frightening to us if we knew how many of them are absolutely socialist now we know Bernie Sanders being a senator from Vermont as liberal as he can be and he makes no bones about it he is a socialist and there's others that say they are socialist can you imagine years ago for people to ever be bold enough to say they were socialist well first of all they would have never got in because people would have never voted for them but the mind of the average American is so perverted and they are so blind that they will put people in the White House they will put him in the governor's mansion oh let's have church and our children they will vote them in oh my goodness why because our nation is groping in Insanity how in the world do we have some of these people that are nothing but died in the W Muslims what in the world are they doing in Congress what are they doing and they're part of their own fa is what destroyed all of the Americans in 9/11 how much more have they destroyed in that Afghanistan Iraq and the oh don't get quiet on me tonight but don't you understand what we're doing we're reaping what was sewn back Yonder little bitty tiny seeds when one politician there and another one over here and another one over there Whoever thought that crime would come to a place where it is right now and our police force cannot even arrest people and they can go in and my goodness I just saw the other day where on the west coast they had went into one of these high dollar luxury places and they busted out every window going through and they were stealing handbags that cost $2 $3,000 a piece and shoes and bracelets and necklaces and there stood the employees and the owner and the headed on video they could not do one thing and they knew not to call the police who would have ever thought such a thing would happen oh my but who puts it in there the the people voted in with their politics well Hallelujah getting a little bit of US History tonight a little bit of geography and a little bit of warning so you don't wind up going to hell and all kinds of good stuff in this service come on children oh my I wonder if you had asked tonight Brother JD uh some of these other brothers that went to the military some of our brothers that had passed brother Daniel Nunley brother Jim bab some of them that risk their life for our freedom wonder if they had it to do over again would they do it for this bunch of rebellious bunch of oh my heathens that claim to be Americans and they burn American flags and say down with America come on children and Hamas hates you Hamas absolutely loves to destroy our nation but let me tell you something Our God still Reigns Our God still has control and Hamas and every body else will never be able to move beyond what God said it is in hamas's constitution in Fat's Constitution amongst all the rest of them to annihilate every Jew that lives on the face of the Earth but if I could I'd tell Hamas thems and tell fat themsel you ain't never going to destroy God's elect God has their name written on the palm of his hand Israel belongs to the Lord and let me bring it on over to the bride let believe the signs say what they want to say let them get on YouTube and tell their lies and their hypocrisy they will never stop the consequences of the message of the hour it will circle the Earth it is not trying to get a following to brother brandom it is to lead people to Jesus Christ oh my Billy Graham will struck the world the Pentecostal struck the world the word has struck the world now what's the matter now now when it starts off the sermon is talking about the law that they're experiencing they're experiencing a la in their meetings in the attendance and so on now watch he says what's the matter now she's now waiting for the lighter rain that's when she produces her fruits oh I hope you get it we will then the kind of seed you have planted in your field will be the kind of crop you reap I mean don't take a rocket scientist to figure that right you plant maters and you go out looking for watermelons you're crazy you plant broccoli you go out looking for grapes what friend why what we look around and say oh we can't believe all this stuff that's around well you and I may not know when but the seeds for what we're seeing right now were planted years ago the seeds of Communism of socialism of all this anti-American stuff if these people don't like America I've got a solution leave leave oh my come on somebody if all these Islamic people up in Minnesota Ilie and Omar and all the rest of the squad let the squad pack up their bags and go back where they come from if you don't like America go on back to Ethiopia and leave us alone if you don't like the way we sing and shout and dance about Pat your little did bag and go somewhere else if you don't like us being an Acts 2 and four Church you ain't going to change me and I believe there's a bunch of people in here you ain't going to change if you don't like it there's the [Applause] door you're going to keep on you going to get me fired he answered back and said fire that's what I'm doing I'm firing you up now you go ahead and fire them up amen friends well what you think well how could this all be oh it's my surprise not really the seeds have laid dormant the seeds have laid dormant but now they're coming up here coming up there coming up over here yes sir oh my you imagine the world our nation ever wanting an Abraham Lincoln we'll never have one but can you imagine if a man of the quality of Abraham Lincoln or even a Ronald Reagan or some good you know good guy that's in the middle of the road and just try to preach freedom and just try to bring it to the nation You' think that everyone need say how in the world can politicians do the things they do why seeds have been swn it's terrifying as an American right it it's kind of scary when you look around and see where we are yes sir brother Donny how is it going to go well I don't know exactly who's going to win the election I can't really say that much but I do believe the powers that be are ordained of God and I say if we need Cala in the white house bring her all yes sir if she is what God's Prophet saw then I don't care how much a trump could be a thousand points ahead that ain't going to do it if she's prophecy well come on somebody I got to be honest with you I hope she ain't prophecy myself I'm an American I love this nation I I get sick seeing what we have turned into but what is it friend it's happening do you think they get up every day nervous and Fring and all wore out and they're exhausted oh oh I've got to fulfill the word oh I've got to fulfill the word i' I've got to hate I've got to despise I've got to be contrary oh I've got to do it they're just being who and what they are and yet somehow we let the devil absolutely paralyze our faith paralyze our walk we're scared to death we're not going to do what God wants us to do if they're doing it and they don't even know it and they're not even trying what in the world is wrong with our faith and our position if they're doing it how much more are we going to do it the Bible tells us in the Book of Revelation in the last days God will put in the hearts of those Heathen Kings and they will give their power unto the Beast if God can move upon a heathen King what about a son or daughter of God that's filled with the Holy Ghost Cann not God move on our hearts to fulfill his will if the denominations want more members that's what they're going to get where do all these mega churches come from they're all over everywhere in America where did they come from seeds that were swn years ago now under the head Planters there was also minor Planters so here's a Billy Graham and here's an or Roberts and here's an a Allen and a jack Cole and you know TLA SP oh my just on and on and on and on come on down whenever those guys died and they come to some of their sons come on from the 60s on down to the 70s you got a Jimmy swager you got a WV Grant you got all these people and what are they doing so they're in there too and they're kind of mixing it up you know and just so and so and so then we look around wow we got all these mega churches you imagine the church down in Houston with 90,000 members I wonder if there's a one of them that's got the true baptism of the Holy Ghost they don't even preach that don't even believe it the preacher himself couldn't have it he did something more than smile whenever he's asked on International television if perverts will go to heaven if all kinds of other people are in the world religions that do not even believe Jesus is the way will they make it into heaven well well well well that's a big subject for such a shallow mind well well well spit it out but they can't his father was under the influence of brother brandham his father knew the prophet and what did it produce out of him a a compromising Slicker Lord have mercy dear Jesus oh come on children Brother Don you going to get yourself killed well that's all right if that's what the Lord wants from me that's exactly the way I go but I will die I will go down fighting I won't go down no yellow belly coward oh my then what does it do can you imagine as it keeps on going down more seeds more seeds more seeds more seeds and the pastors drink another big mega church just had a split you probably heard about it Pastor living and moral one after another there's men in there that ain't even called of God they're not even born again gracious life the Pentecostals want more Pentecostals and that's what they're going to get watch they want more Pentecostals and that's what they're going to get the denominations want more denominations that's what they're going to get we want word born Holy Ghost filled Christians well if they're going to get what they want and the denomination going to get what they want and the Pentecost are going to get what they want you're going to sat there and tell me we ain't going to get what we want Hallelujah we don't want church membership at our church we don't want people to come here and sit like a bump on a pickle and don't even know God himself what do we want brother Joe we want people that come to the Lord Jesus and they die out to themselves and die out to the worldly nature and that oh Val nature of theirs is destroyed and they are filled with the very life of [Music] God so the man that God used to sew this seed was so much like Jesus that people actually thought he was uhhuh that's what I'm want little mamas little daddies brothers sisters young people young men young women yes sir that's so Godly Hallelujah that the devil's in Hell back off when you come all right you shouldn't have to get up and no say oh Lord oh Lord I live soon the night I was hoping I die oh no don't tell me another day but when you get up in the morning you set that number six or seven or eight or n9ine or 10 or 11 or 12 whatever it is down on the floor them Devils don't say Lord have mercy I was hoping she'll die with a heart attack during the night dear God don't tell me she made it to another life don't tell me Daryl's here another day who's he going to pray for today watch him boys he's dangerous that man's like walking hand grenades and my M60 Cannon watch out what you're doing them young men them young women what in the world's going on with them in this Dark Age you can't put us out devil you try to pour concrete on us and we'll come out under the edges you try to shut us up and we'll scream louder he tried to burn our brothers and sisters he tried to drown them he tried to crucify him he tried to do everything but you can't hide life you cannot hide God's predestinated SE we are going to come up the Pentecostals want more Pentecostals and that's what they're going to get that's right but the word is going to produce Sons and Daughters of God uhhuh uh-huh that's coming too amen we spend too much time I'm afraid on that other and we need to point in our Direction that's coming too I know we've got a bunch of message hybrids I know there's people that are not bride sure they are but brother sister that was not the seed swn by Elijah that's only come up by a crossbreeding of a Pentecostal that turned into a so-called message or a Church of Christ that turned into a so-called message or a Baptist that turned in come on somebody oh yeah that's what we've got we've got Baptist preachers standing in message pull pit we've got church of Christ preachers standing in message pull Church of Christ by theology they don't believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost they don't believe in the move of God they don't believe in a new birth well glory to God hallelujah but we've also got sons of God that are standing in message pulpit and they are preaching a gospel that's changing people's lives they have the very signs of the Lord Jesus [Applause] himself well glory to God oh my that's coming too watch look at that great ladder rain that's supposed to be done they would run over the wall and leap over and how there'd be an army coming just wait a minute uhhuh the kind of crop you'll get is the kind of seed you put in you feel all right the two denominational kinds you understand you understand the two denominational kinds will unite together to go where ahow so you see the spirit of sodomy and sodomites could not just stay out there in the world outside the ranks of religion remember lot was the tie and they was knocking on lot's door and then he steps up there oh my brothers oh my brothers uh-huh calling them brothers huh well come on children the denominations are splitting right and left wanting women in the pull pit preaching wanting perverts pastoring here's the God's Prophet word coming to pass that The ecumenical and the Pentecostals will go to Sodom oh my oh Hallelujah I want you to notice it was not Sodom knocking on Abraham's door well glory to God they knew better that old skin their hide oh Hallelujah they didn't go up there and knock on Abraham's door and say can we be a pastor in your church can we be a deacon in church Abraham said get your hide out of here you pervert oh but they could go down to Old L it wouldn't surprise me a bit if some of our message compromising preachers before it's all said and done we'll start allowing all types of perversions of their Pulpit why they don't believe this message in the first place they're not even born again them s what are they message HBS message bastards to the [Applause] word where's the fire extinguisher Lord have mercy somebody bring it somebody bring it sweet Jesus Carol honey why don't you fix me to eat for supper the two denominational kinds will unite together to go to Sodom but the word will stay with the elected the Royal Sea so the two angels in the Book of Genesis they went down to Sodom but God stayed with Abraham God never went to Sodom God has nothing to do with such perversion but two angels went down there and blinded them don't you understand what their type of gospel does it blinds people so all you got to do is believe that's that's all you got to do you don't have to live right you don't have to overcome nothing you just you just believe except Jesus as your savior and you got eternal life and then you're Sav forever you know you just do whatever you want to do what does that do it blinds them and they say well I can live any way I want to live I can do whatever I want to do and then I've got habits I'm unclean I commit adulterine I lie and this and that the other but but I believe Jesus I believe Jesus and that kind of a gospel blinds them and pulls a veil over their heart and they hear some naad like me preaching they say are you people out of your mind to S and listen to that nitwit that guy ain't got a li a sense well what school did he go to well what what kind of theology does he have what what what college did he grab was it Bob Jones no I got a degree in predestination I got a degree in election I got a degree in calling cuz father himself called me well praise the Lord uh does that help no no no goodness no who in the world ever heard of Sy theology in my life Lord how Mercy how many people does he run off but how many Do We Gather in oh remember this is like a net and I'm throwing that big net out there and the Net's going to fall then the Lord Jesus and the angels of God will separate them I'll look at them and say looks like a fish to me but sometimes it ain't a fish it ain't nothing but a slippery eel I'll look at said that looks like a slippery eel but it's head down between an eel but it's actually a fish on the underside so you see the Lord has to be the one that does the separate not you and I amen lot once had the choice to be inter denominational himself is that right he once had the choice to Journey was Abraham but the love of the world choked him out that's what it's done today and remember those down in Sodom never seen one of of those Supernatural Miracles they had a blinding and preaching the word blinds the eyes of the unbeliever that's what big gram and them's done blinded the eyes of unbelievers out there oh God thank you I can see Lord thank you Lord that's right you can't deny Jesus that Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so will it be in the coming here in the Bible see the same thing at the coming of the son of man the word stayed with the elected one and the word of God today will stay with the elected ones the Royal Seed of Abraham by the promise now watch he talks about Abraham at length there but I I cut a little bit of this out you can go back and read it all if you'd like jump on down the paragraph a little farther there stood God and said where is thy wife I'm at the tent visitation now where is thy wife Sarah like you didn't know said she's in the tent behind you said I'm going to visit you I personal pronoun I'm going to visit you according to the time of life oh and you're going to have that baby you've waited on the latter rain is fixing the fall so the latter rain was the promised son oh thank you Jesus the latter rain ain't just emotion we believe in it we're pretty emotional right here tonight the latter rain ain't just speaking in tongues the latter rain is a person GL well glory to God the show oh Hallelujah to God thank you Lord Jesus the light of rain look I love the way he catches it the light of rain is fixing the fall oh you're going to have that baby you waited on the latter ring it's fixing to fall you hold that seat in there long enough now on believing you're looking for a coming son and he's coming amen that's the real church today that's exactly what Satan wants to get our eyes off of uh we want to get our eyes on this preacher that great man and that great man and that great man all them are great men no doubt whoever they are I ain't looking for some great man to take me on I'm looking for the promised son I don't know of any preacher that fulfills that promise there's only one and that's the Lord Jesus Oh My you've been looking for him and I'm going to send him to you amen what said that the word the word the two groups the Pentecostal group and the denominational of the world the Evangelical groups is merging together see what for says it again going to Sodom to reap this Harvest so you'll have the church right in the midst of Sodom yes and many of them will be afraid to say anything against it they don't want their name their picture their face on television they don't want to be banned on YouTube they don't want people marching out there with banners and oh you better you don't have to have a law against it can't you see how close we are to the end time of the mark of the beast people can just parade against you and post all kinds of things against you on social media and that within itself creates a pressure and a lot of people just back off it works the same way in politics whoever screams the loudest we found that in building our church here you know so and so said he'd be over to we'll say you know he's a sheetrock guy he's a he's a concrete guy he'll be here on Monday next Monday I found out don't actually mean what I was always taught I always thought next Monday meant next Monday but actually it don't in construction world I'm convinced God's going to have some people saved in construction work just to show the devil he can do it and show all of them ain't Liars and if you tell somebody you're going to be there and you don't show up and don't call them there's something wrong with their Christianity if you can't do it let them know you ought to be a man or a woman of your word Amen brother Donnie oh my now watch what are they going to Sodom going to reap this Harvest now what they're trying to do is to manufact facture a latter rain and again he says nonsense why that latter rain will sweep the world brother and then a former sewing rain sewing word that's right and you'll see what that latter rain produces you'll find out there being affiliation the Pentecostals and all the groups will come together and they'll shut the door on them guys that won't listen to it and you won't be allowed to open your mouth now you know what I find sad is we've got people in the message that are working under the pre-tribulation anointing because if they had their way about it they'd like to close every Church door and everybody just sit at home and listen to a tape that's not the the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ it's the anointing of the last days Antichrist brother bham said it would shut the Tabernacle doors they're already shut but it wasn't a World Council of churches that shut them oh I know you don't like to hear it I'm called to preach the truth the whole truth so help me God uhhuh brother brandom ordained preachers to preach and there's a move around this message that wants to set everyone of them down and shut them up and say all they need to do is press play will preach brother Donnie I think it will what is it it's the devil I said it's the devil it's the spirit of antichrist show me where brother brandham ever laid his hands on an MP3 player and said you will replace preachers show me where brother bam ever laid his hands on a real to real or a cassette player or an audio player whatever you want to call it I can show you an I press play where the Prophet said God don't use mechanical equipment God don't use machines a tap player can't feel for you a CD player can't feel for you but God laid the word over the Levites Hearts why a levite can cry a levite can be led by the spirit of God a levite can move from his notes wow that's where God lays the word over the hearts of his God call men oh [Applause] my listen this dear God help us how close they'll shut the doors on them guys that won't listen to it you won't even be allowed to open your mouth that's right that's when he will come amen that's when he will show that's when you'll see a rain oh my lay still be quiet Let It Go the Hebrew word Moray which means teaching in other words it'll be a teaching rain and a harvest rain we've had the teaching rain and we're ready now for the Harvest rain let's [Applause] stand I understand

you but you let your job and just everyday not not sin things not wrong abominable things just the things of life we can't keep from our heart been broken looking around my goodness the every day is something new on the news you think how is this possible how is this PO possible in the United States of America when Jewish students already I just heard some of them today on the radio on some of our major universities and they was listing the different things that these Jewish students have been slapped and Jewish students that have been called all types of names and made fun of and ridicule if it was any other minority group in this nation they would have them slammed in jail but with the Jew it's like you're expected to treat them that way oh my pre-tribulation anointing is all around us but let's not get so drunk on that and look at all that we ought to be under such great expectation that we also are fixing to reap our Harvest thank you Lord ours will be twofold ours will be every name who's on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world but it will also be the long awaited Resurrection from the dead part of our lter rain will be the resurrection oh he will prove which ones are his you see people can claim it oh I'm it I'm the bride I'm this I'm that I'm that up that the Mount Zion Showdown will prove move which one's is but you see the thing of it is we don't have to wait until then we can actually have an assurance tonight amen that we're going to be part of that Showdown that's right why we've done had a showdown in ourselves we laid our vile nature on the Altar and the fire of God come down the Judgment of God broke over our nature and annihilated our nature when you get down listen spoken words there Original Seed listen to you must be born again 1961 you'll catch those words there we lay our nature on the Altar and the Judgment of God breaks on that nature and annihilates sin nature amen and we get up off of that altar with the nature of the Lord Jesus then truly we can say God is in our midst amen amen and at that day it will be I and you and you and me listen friends this is why we believe in preach in our church healing signs miraculous all those wonderful things because this Supernatural of those things will forun the latter Reign now there'll be people that will impersonate it there will be people that don't even live right and have those signs that's right that comes with it but that don't change us from believing it it's our bread okay I am not a false anointed one well how do we know you're not check me by the word don't check me by my Miracles don't check me by the signs don't check brother darl by his signs check me by the word check every Spirit by the word see what it says about the word well I

presence of Adonai with us hallelujah hallelujah oh Lord God help us that we'll not do as our Father Abraham made the mistake and left his Oak and backslid and got away from it may we never leave our tree oh Jesus thank you for Dying For Me Lord you went to hell for me so I won't have to go you redeemed me you died a curse you died out of the presence of God so I won't have to how many of the

prayed for our sister Tama and what she'd been dealing with for the last several years the presence of God come by and touched our sister and moved it that's what I'm talking about that's our Mighty God hallelujah he wants to walk Among Us he wants to prove himself if he can't heal us how can I have any assurance that he can raise the dead if he can't heal a sick living body how in the world could I believe he could raise a body that has went back Beyond acids and gases but when I see him heal the sick and the crippled and The Afflicted last year in brother Ron's meeting his little granddaughter how old was you Carol three at the time maybe something like that that couldn't talk and the doctor said there was something missing and they said it might be she might be 16 years old
