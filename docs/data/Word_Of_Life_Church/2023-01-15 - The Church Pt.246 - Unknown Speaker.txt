chapter 31. or return there are a lot to make this announcement brother Rob and Sister Sarah Weber about to announce their engagement of their daughter Emma to John Michael Laster I told him the other day he finally must have proved himself enough to get Daddy's permission I think he had a hard time doing it too let's just give him a nice time [Applause] being a daddy with two girls when you get ready to give him away I'll tell you it takes pretty good man to be able to get him from your heart because you love them that's right Proverbs chapter 31. verse 10. who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies the heart of her husband death safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil what a woman she will do him good and not evil all the days I've always loved these scriptures since I've started reading them just as a boy but once I began to realize who these were written about I've really loved them more especially when you consider it was written about Bathsheba so how could this woman been a temptress a seductress a woman who did something ungodly to get the attention of the king David and this ever be said about her couldn't have been of course it's not to me the Marvel that she was that but how she could deal with all the trauma complexes fears anxieties that she brought to the Palace and still able to become this type of woman I mean I'd like to be remembered today as we pray God bless you Mrs holder needs our requests in our hearts Heavenly fathers we Bower hits in your presence we sense that you're here we believe that you've come once again that you could speak to us Lord God I pray that you would take charge of the service help me Lord God that I can speak that which is pleasing to you shout my mouth to anything that would displease you May every heart be opened May every life be challenged changed by the word of God you see the needs Lord of our people many are sick many are dealing with various things in their bodies we bring them before you today Lord asking you that should be mindful but I pray you'd go even deeper than our body today are you going to our spirits may you go into our conscience our memory and you go into our souls woo us with your being father pull us up close to you that we can hear you whisper secrets secrets that's only given to the bride of Your Love your purpose your plan for each of Our Lives help us today Father in the name of Jesus we pray amen God bless you you may be seated I'm sure as we sit here today gathered in this place we've come with different needs different desires different requests on our hearts before the Lord I believe that the Lord is so mindful of every one of us no matter what you need no matter what you've been through what you're currently going through the Lord Jesus in his love to come and redeem us so much so that he would become one of us I know I've preached about it a lot you've heard it preached many of you since you first gave your heart to the Lord of what he became and his great Act of condescension I wonder sometimes how much I still know about it the more I read about it as I was last night the more I realized there was an Avenue about him that I still need help with not that I don't believe him I do but to be able to see how far he's stepped down and what he was willing to become in order to redeem us because his love is so great and we know that in his love we sometimes measure it by human love Carol and I took Erica down to Nashville the other day to get a treatment and seeing her and and quite a bit of pain and discomfort and stuff coming back looking at her and um just watching her and having to go down and pray for her after we brought her home and as her parents looking at her and feeling this in you how it breaks your heart and many of you have felt the same way about loved ones and friends and you look at them and you hurt so deeply you wish there was something you could do to change it to fix it to make it better and yet we know God looks at people's hurts and their pains and the things they deal with and he looks at it in a different way than we do we look with a human empathy a human sympathy and compassion and we feel so sorry for them but yet the Lord looks at people in a way that is so different than we do because he's looking at the bigger picture of what he wants to accomplish out of something that he allows them to go through now let me say before we get started in this direction this morning I don't believe that God is the orchestrator of many things that has happened to many of us in our lives I don't believe that God is a murderer of the innocent I do not believe that God is the cause of many things that happened in your life in my life lives of other people people want to blame God for many things that the devil does that always bothers me whenever I hear people blaming God for things the devil does whether they're Christians or Sinners it bothers me more so when I hear Christians say well God told me to do this and I look in his word and I'm saying there ain't no way my daddy told you to do something contrary to his scripture he just don't do any such thing but yet we know that God looks with a different a different view than we do and how can God look at people in their suffering and how can God look at people when they're going through so much stuff in life and he wouldn't even have to speak all he'd have to do is just look their Direction and that problem would totally be eliminated and they would be set free delivered healed or whatever it was they was going through and yet why does he allow it to go on why does God allow people sometimes good people people that really are not reaping because of something they've done and yet they suffer so much and go through so many things and then Satan of course loves to take those things and twist them around in our minds and try to make us question our God but myself is an individual I call that a no-fly zone I don't fly there because I'll never understand stand all the mind of God nor the will of God and you won't either but I've learned to trust him even when I don't understand what he's doing because I believe Divine sovereignty is that Progressive attitude of God that will override human circumstance in order to make his will come to pass in our lives I believe in that myself but I look and I realize that God then is not always the cause of terrible things happening to good people but God in turn will turn around and use some of those terrible things that that have happened to people and make them work out to where that he can use them for his own honor and Glory how many seen that in your own life or the life of others now it's not that God himself was the cause or the instigator of the thing that happened but he will turn it around and make it work to his own glory and this is what I see about the story of David and Bathsheba that we've been looking at that the Lord would allow Bathsheba one which was brought into the first view of the scripture we know nothing about our past we know nothing about her childhood nothing about her hardly at all other than her first appearance is whenever she's brought into the Palace of King David and we or looked at it for a few weeks now seeing it was beyond her own choice she had no choice to do this David never loved her he never cared for her initially he lusted after her would just be honest and Frank David was a great man but he was a man and David made a terrible terrible mistake and he paid for it the rest of his life is that right but yet God did not Mark David off and neither did God break his Everlasting Covenant with David So Bathsheba had to bring a lot of things with her no doubt into the Palace of the king and as I've been looking at this I've realized that God merged her into the natural genealogy of the Lord Jesus in order to bring a picture and to be able to display the picture of the making of the Gentile bride that God brought in Rahab for an element God brought in Tamar and God brought in these others and then God brings the last woman which is Mary which is the epitome of a virgin bride which speaks of your soul and yet God allowed these which were scarred and these which were wounded by others and some of them by themselves things that they did and brought on their self and the Lord never looked at them and said you know what you've got not a bad background you've got a bad pass I really don't think it would be worse me risking you to identify you and my genealogy now the truth of it is there's probably every one of us here today that have people in our families and people in our family tree I've never been too concerned about looking up my family tree and finding monkeys because I know I didn't come from a monkey but what I'd be more ashamed of of some of my family not not afraid of baboon will be up my family tree it's some of them gangsters and robbers and you know Train Robbers and this and that and the other and don't some of y'all smile because they stole your horse and they did because you stole their Pig so all of us are from the same bucket of gum and mess when it comes to humanity ain't that the truth so all of us I'm sure wouldn't have to look very far to find people in our family tree that have done some pretty terrible things and some of you might not have to look past yourself but needless to say the Lord does not hold that against us and that he will not allow us to be something greater than what we even are right now I saw a sign the other day and I thought it was a remarkable sign and it said these words don't let what you currently are hinder you from becoming what your full potential really is and I thought that's a wonderful thing that even what we are today I personally don't think that I've reached my Heights in Christ Jesus I think there's more for me I mean he believes the same thing I believe there's a deeper want a greater understanding oh but you're an old man I realize that but I'm still younger than Abraham was when God started dealing with them so haha devil look out here I come so God started dealing with Abraham when he was 75 years old I'm just 66 so I'm still a young man by that standard but we can look at our past and look at our failures and if we're not careful we will let that determine what we think God will do for us and God's looking at it in a total different way let me start this with this this morning in a sermon called the Great Mighty conquer before any Victory can be won there must be great prices to be paid oh what prices and sometimes they are very deep and they make very great scars tearing down but in order to have the mountain we've got to have the valley before you can have the sunshine we've got to have rain before we can have the light we have to have the night or the light rather before we can have the right we have to have wrong and you would have never known what wrong was now here brother random I love the way that he projects the full gospel because he preaches healing he preaches Miracles he preaches the supernatural the phenomenal power of God but he also preaches where we live every day of our life how many beliefs and miracles he healing signs wonders Supernatural but how many also knows you got trials you got tests of life you got difficulties well you know this is the way I see that as a preacher I want to preach the message as well that I want to preach a God that is so mighty and so great and so wonderful there's absolutely nothing we can ever go through that he can't bring us through that I also want to preach life in a realism form and that is that you're going to have tests trials people aren't going to love you you're not going to everybody that comes to the Lord Jesus is not going to be a millionaire sorry if you thought you were I hate to bust your balloon but some of you are not going to be billionaires and millionaires some of you won't even be thousand heirs that's right some of you is going to struggle it's just the way it is you're never going to get up every day of your life and never have a sickness that's not reality but I want to preach to you that if you do have sickness you have a Healer and if you have a need to have a mighty God that is bigger than ever need you will ever have in this life I love the way that our Prophet stands in this aspect and brings these things to us notice again from his personal perspective now and the reproach of the cause of the word my heart has got so many scars on it Lord from hard battles I'm an old veteran help me Lord I need your help now what I hear from this is not the mighty Elijah standing there before the false prophets of Baal I don't hear Elijah when he calls for the two she bears come destroy the children I don't hear the mighty conquering Elijah as he rebuilds The Altar and calls for the spirit of God to come down but I hear from a man Anointed with that spirit that is giving us an inside view of a hurt wounded individual any of them type of people here today now he gives us a little tiny glimpse inside of his heart his heart now we tend to rejoice in the Miracles the signs the Wonders the phenomenon I'll read you about some of them in a few minutes but myself I know I'm weird I know but myself I absolutely love quotes just like this one because it helps me to relate as a minister as the Son of God and I trust it'll help you relate today my heart's got so many scars on it Lord from hard battles I'm an old veteran help me Lord I need help maybe all this training has been for a purpose I trust it has been Lord help me oh God help me oh God so we have to believe either one of two things from this statement this is only an act this is only a put on that this man was not sincere or this is the sincere cry of a great veteran Warrior I know what I believe what do you believe you believe it's a veteran Warrior I thought so so then this Warrior is asking God for hell for what to cast out another devil to be able to lay hands on a cross-eyed child that God would heal it no help help from wounds and scars battles he must have been feeling kind of weary anybody in your ever get there well the rest of you Godly angels that are here today would you remember us four Mortals now let me share this with you I have never seen any cross-eyed child ever come to the platform but what was healed better than 300 cases of cross-eyed children have been healed and less than six months time now those of you who want to believe that brother Brandon was a false prophet and those who have attacked him and you feel like you've been sent by God to straighten us out I'm going to ask you to do 300 I'll ask you to perform three and then I'll sit down and talk with you let me know when you do it but until we'll follow this better than 300 cases of cross-eyed children that were healed in less than six months we have a record of it 40 000 testimonies to the sick to date of healing Witnesses signed by doctors forty thousand healings to date this is 19 and 50. signed by doctors again we won't require 40 000 of you what about four and until you can keep your mouth off of God's prophet [Applause] now wonder why there was never across a child that ever come across the platform that was never healed not what Wonder why an embedded scar on a servant's heart speaking about his little eight-month-old daughter I'll never forget she was eight months old and I remember I used to come home and she'd sat down in the yard and I'd blow my horn and come around the corner and she'd go goo goo and she'd reach I love those little fellas now he reverts from that back to when she was dying she was suffering so hard to one of them little fat legs was moving up and down in a spasm and looked like her little hand was waving and I looked at her and I said Sherry honey you know Daddy I was trying to make myself strong and I said you know Daddy honey her little lips got to quiff it she looked at me she was suffering so hard till her eyes crossed her eyes crossed I imagine Satan stood there and laughed but he will pay little did he know one cross-eyed child would cost him one after another after another after another hundreds of thousands of them did God do this it wasn't God but God took what had happened and did something out of the life of this man the point I want you to see today is friends what will we do what's the negative things in life that we've been through whether people have intentionally hurt us or not intentionally hurt us or have been let down or disappointed or whatever more will we spend our life in inside for ourself and just you know poor little me poor little me or will we allow God to take the things we've been through like Bathsheba a woman who was defiled the prophet said David defiled his neighbor's wife David was the one who instigated this evil and this wrong but we don't find Bathsheba turning into the type of woman that set around the palace all day and did absolutely nothing feeling so sorry for herself but she is the very epitome of what an honorable virtuous woman should be even for the New Testament Daughters of God so it depends on what we do with what life gives us brother random calls it the human grab bag the human grab bag so out of the human grab bag we can get all types of sickness and afflictions and complexes and fears and Trauma and so much stuff that we inherit from our parents or our grandparents or uncles and then all the other stuff that's placed upon us through our short span of life and then we go to looking at serving God and we bring all this stuff to him Lord here I am what do you what can you do with me what what can you do with me Lord well I've got this fear and I've got I don't trust preachers and I don't trust men and I don't trust women I don't I don't like this and I don't like that and I've got racial problems and I've got this problem and now if there's anything you can do with me God yeah I am go ahead well the first thing he needs to change is our attitude now listen how that he unveils this part this is 1950 by now he's found out I didn't know it then but I understand it now there has never been a cross-eyed child that come in the line there's never been one that placed over the platform that was healed I didn't know the crushing that it had to bring forth but I never see it I never see it till I think of it so you can imagine every child black white red yellow make no difference what size they were how old they were but every one of them that would walk up there before him who would he see not just that child but his own daughter Sharon Rose anybody here that has lost a loved one to cancer and whenever you do there's something about that oh you hear you know people and friends and relatives and that had it and they passed away oh that's terrible that's terrible but when it happens to you there's something about it it affects you in a more personal way as a pastor I hate cancer I hate covet I hate different diseases that have come and attacked people in our church I hate it because as a pastor God gives me a charge to watch over my sheep and I do everything in my power I hate it when disease strikes God's people don't you I hate it when it comes and it gives me something inside now I hope you understand that God will layer the supernatural many times over the top of the natural makeup that he allowed to be molded in US can't you see what God did in the prophet that God layered the Supernatural and brother random is not standing there out of human anger because we don't cast out Devils out of human anger we don't cast out Devils by a loud screaming voice but we cast them out by Authority but God layered the supernatural over the top of the natural and then when this Prophet spoke him on a person to walk up and he would see them there in that condition and what happened something from within was an empathy that could never be bred into he could have read all kinds of books of people who had lost a child and the baby had died with the eyes being crossed it would have never had the same impact upon him but it happened to him do you understand those of you sit here today and you've got hurts and issues and scars and things like that instead of allowing those things to control you why don't you let God layer over those hurts and let God be able to use you as a witness and you will be able to tell other people in a way that maybe I could not tell them look brother sister you can allow God to take those things and turn them into something that will expand your testimony to others and you can tell others God can help you through hurts and God can help you through disappointments and God can help you through sad times or you can sit around and feel sorry for yourself and struggle and not do anything for the kingdom of God I refuse to be a victim of pain I refuse to be a victim of being wounded and hurt by this and that and the other instead I choose to be an instrument of healing through my pain an instrument of healing through my loss anybody know what I'm saying so we take what we've went through in life and allow God to turn around and mold it and make it into something to his honor you know I realize we're living in an age whenever everybody wants so many therapists and I'm not against therapists as long as they don't tell you something contrary to God's word but I know that there is an element of this about therapy and phobias and traumas my goodness I've never heard so many phobias in my life you know the when you go to read about it you can't even keep up they got so many phobias people now are being able to draw unemployment because they got a fear of covet so I think a lot of lazy folks are just you and using that so they can stay home and draw a chair well go ahead somebody praise the Lord that's all right but it's exactly what people want and then we have so many self-help books and really there's only one book that can help you out of all the things that Satan got you into and that is the word of God I don't care who writes you will say well I recommend this book from Dr Dobson and I recommend that book from Dr so and so and I recommend that book from Dr so and so well I recommend the Bible from Dr God because Dr God is the true physician and he won't tell you to leave your wife and his sir won't tell you women to cut your hair and he won't tell you men well you're going to that old legalistic church and you need to live a little bit there's only one way to really be able to live and that's in Christ Jesus do I believe phobias are real I do I deal with people who have them all the time listen to this how strange they can be I do not know you I've never seen you we are strangers but I notice around you you have a phobia of something you have a phobia of something about wintertime now how strange when winter time comes you resent it now can you imagine this might be your only opportunity that you get to stand before Elijah in your lifetime he doesn't tell you what a great Christian you are how many chapters you read before church how many times you pray a day how many times you fasted the great sacrifices you've given to the kingdom of God but before God and the devil and everybody else he tells you you've got a phobia of wintertime but you know what that's what this person needed to hear I imagine if God's Prophet was shared today and still Discerning I'd say that if he started with me and went down to every person here probably what he would tell us wouldn't be some great Supernatural something and people would be so overwhelmed by your spiritual wealth and your spiritual depth in God I'd say we'd more fine would find out more about one another's Humanity than we knew of knowing each other in decades because he probably wouldn't tell us great complementary things it would be such carnal stuff it would be fears and phobias and that well I was somebody who would preach with me this morning why because a lot of these things are what hinder our spirituality with God anyway it's things like this that hold us back from going on I want you to listen what A peculiar thing that he says when winter time comes you resent it you get scared when winter time comes and it makes you all upset and it makes you constipated wow so this poor person probably tried fiber they probably tried more apples more pears more prunes prune juice they got online and they Dr Googled it of course Dr Google wasn't in there then but today that's what we would do and they've done everything depending on whether they lean toward the natural means or they lean toward the medical process and they would go all natural if they were natural and there's all medical they'd go on medical and hear God's profit goes right down to the problem who what doctor What doctor would ever Associated a fear of wintertime to being the cause of constipation wow so I wonder how many things we're dealing with here today and we are treating the side effects with this and that and the other and we've got one tablet for this and another appeal for that and a shot for this and you know we read some new something another coming from way over there in some foreign country I don't know why it is but this is the Curiosity of human beings they found some nut that falls off of a tree and it you know it's grain in purple yellow striped and has white polka dots that run down the middle of it and it's this rare saying and they found out that when monkeys eat it that it caused them to do this and that and then somebody in a pyramid scheme wants you to be a partaker of it and then you have so many people under you and then people pop that peel whoa I feel so cooked wow they laced that with dope you better stay away from that bottle pop and then after a week or so oh I'm right back where I was shame on us shame on us for following all this stuff when really the reality is I the answer is the Lord Jesus now I want you to notice how the prophet deals with this phobia wintertime the side effect of constipation does it recommend apples prunes prune juice but he said ah curse that devil in the name of Jesus Christ go home it won't bother you no more left you oh Hallelujah I'll tell a friend brother brennaman here today Paul ain't here today James saying here today but the same Lord Jesus that made that devil leave that individual it's right here in this building today Hallelujah [Applause] this is from Dawson Creek British Columbia what's the matter Soldier Boy you're not going to commit suicide the devil's lying to you boy you remember the story about the Soulja Boy in British Columbia Dawson Creek you've only got a phobia he's lying to you he will drive you insane if you believe him you remember what this was homosexuality he will drive you insane if you believe him tender him renounce that devil Hallelujah I command you in the name of Jesus Christ renounce the devil wow I want you to notice now the commanding is not going to the devil in this situation but the prophet is commanding this Soldier Boy to renounce the devil so here he's commanding him Oh Glory I wonder sometimes if some of you all ain't waiting on brother Daryl to do it for you or waiting on me to do it for it or somebody else to do it for him and you need to rise in faith and say Satan in the name of Jesus I command you leave my body leave me you tumor leave me you gross leave me you nervousness my house is a house of God I have no room for you and my body leave my body in the name of Jesus Christ [Applause] I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to renounce the devil and accept Jesus Christ as your healer healer healer get him with a homosexual saying and you need healing but where was there something in his body that was causing it his spirit a woman and man are not just different in their body and their Anatomy they're different in their spirit don't you understand people that walk that wall they're crossed up in their spirit that's why you and I try to rehab them and try to talk them out of it we'll never do it they need Deliverance inside themselves it's a devil anointing and Crossing up their Spirit what in the world would make a big fat ugly man one who drove great his hair grow out like a woman and hair on his leg like a gorilla and want to be a girl he's messed up in his spirit remember God didn't just take God could take a male rib and make female anatomy God took a male rib from Adam and made a woman's body out of it but God did not take Adam's spirit and put Adam's Spirit but he divided the spirits that he placed in Adam in Adam all glory in Adam was that masculine thing but in Adam was also Eve's identity and God separated that part from her he did not give her Adam's male spirit and Eve said well glory to God I'm in charge of the Garden of Eden now Hallelujah I'm going to take care of everything you know imagine when he opened up his eyes When papa laid him down there on that ground and put him to sleep maybe just passed his hand over his eyes and the Divine anesthesia he just started and papa reaches in all right and pose a real bow from Henry's heart and he lays the rib over on the table and then Papa goes in to Adam's spirit and divides this tenet shy female traits that God had made in him and God put this inside the spirit the spirit inside this body and then she comes up and met God and I've told her go stand by him when he comes to him she's standing there by him and takes his hand starts taking her little tiny fingers her little dainty fingers are rubbing over his hands sweetheart sweetheart wake up I'm on them type of guys whenever I have to have a procedure done they can't hardly get me awake at all I've had to have procedures in and I'm just unclear Hallelujah but you know who they've sent to my room before whenever I've had to have a colonoscopies or whatever it is to get me awake a little lady right there Donnie Donnie wake up hey girl what is it you imagine as Adam's eyes began to come open and here was this how you doing buddy I'm essential lady around to the American League I'm in charge of that God gave me to be your head I'm supposed to be on it I guess we can dismiss now I'm sorry but you can imagine the first time when he looked at her blonde hair and her blue eyes and her standing there in the form that God made to the prophet said the most beautiful woman that ever lived ever lived and yet so dainty and so touched him and was able to minister time and it was something he said where did she come from from you from you but this Soldier Boy just got messed up somehow so instead of being attracted to women well the prophet never looked at him and said you ain't got no hope boy you're damned to hell you get out of my prayer line you ain't got no right setting in there come on children I pray God will help us to reach to that kind and every other kind that the spirit of God leads us to watch this he said renounce the devil and accept Jesus Christ as your healer you'll go back and be a gentleman a real real man a gentleman a real real man raise up your hands to God and say praise God that's right now go back home and be well so you mean the person was sick yes not in the body spirit we just message people so specialize in ministering to the soul others of our ranks specialize so much their entire Ministries ministering to the body but ain't we got some preachers that can minister to the human spirit to help pull our Spirits into harmony with God's word gonna go on what's this what what's your trouble this is in Dallas in 64. you've had an accident and then that accident you were gassed was carbon monoxide gas now is that true it poisons you it poisons you in your liver and you've had trouble with that and you've had trouble with your stomach and the brother says that's right okay so some of these Hypocrites are tail bound that's standing up refuting all this here is a man that had the opportunity to say you're a liar and that's a false prophet he said that's right so you're going to go back in time and refute this man you say why do you do that because I'm called to stand the defense of this word hey look friend God didn't call me there'd be no Pennywise preacher dot God didn't call me and give me a yellow streak up my back I've stood for this word for decades of my life I'll stand for it until the day I die I will stand for it and say it as a message sent from God it is a message that's called us out and we will not give it up oh my you've had trouble with your heart that's right this is the brother answering him it's made you so nervous till you've built yourself in a complex you're poor and you must go back to work but you're afraid to go to work now look what Satan will do Satan will cause something to happen to you and then you will build a complex out of it and then Satan will try to cut you off from the very resource that you need to live I hear this man was having a job dealing with this type of stuff we don't know exactly what it was but he had got poisoned by carbon monoxide poisoning and it had built this thing anyway it caused liver damage and caused other things and this caused the complex to other man don't want to go back to work because he's afraid to go back now because it may happen again you know what Satan don't just do that to work he loves to do that to church so people get their feelings hurt going to church and they get their feelings hurt going here though well I don't believe in Preachers no more I don't believe in going to church no more I got hurt I ain't going back there's too many Hypocrites at church I guess I just have maybe a slight problem with that so those of you that are going to Longhorn after service today for church for lunch others of you are going here and there and there now of course you will do this the same way that you do church right that you will go in and say I will not eat in this place if there's any hypocrite yet all gays all homosexuals all liars all out while I hate oh I see it's written on your face you don't have to say one word so you have one standard for church and another standard for your favorite restaurant now if you go to Walmart after after you eat your lunch then and I suppose you go up to the service desk and you take the microphone a Ted shot a 10 shot all liars all whoremongers all thieves all women with verses on all this and that other leave until me and my family are done shopping and then you can come back or I will not shop at Walmart you'll be waving on your way out because they will throw you out so what does Satan want to do have any y'all ever noticed you can be feeling wonderful on Monday morning to go to work another work day oh man alive it's Monday it's Monday it's Monday here I go I'm telling you what and then Wednesday comes close to the midweek service Tuesday evening oh my tummy hurts and then Wednesday morning you get up go work how are you oh I'm feeling so good Wednesday evening gonna be able to go to church I don't think so and people that don't believe in miracles they ought to watch people on Thursday morning because I'm thirsty morning they get up and go to work how are you today I'm a chipper is a squirrel and a hickory nut pal I'm telling you what I feel so great I don't know what nowhere will happen it's a miracle it's a miracle uh-huh do you honestly think you're going to be rewarded at that day for how faithful you were to your job to how many days I've worked so many days straight and haven't missed a day do you want a star you want a trophy what are you looking for isn't it amazing some of our priorities when it comes to church we have all church will always be here and I'm going to tell you I won't always be here no it won't well you can go to church anytime no you can't one day the bride will be gone our building may be left but the bride will be gone and people get into such a complex why because Satan knows if there's any place they can go to get helped it's Church where the word is preached and the spirit of God is there and deliverance is there if I was the devil I do my best to keep you out of church too foreign you're afraid to go back to work but it's all going to be all right now just remember if Jesus Christ will tell me who you are wow and that those things are true will you believe and accept it will you do it your name is Mr Wagner that's right that's right go on back to work Hallelujah well your name is misoffended and Mr hurt go on back to church going back to church Hallelujah you're gonna be healed go on back to church go on back to your family go on back to God go on back and let God do something for you Isaiah 53 3 says it this way he was despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief we hid as it were our faces from him and he was despised and we esteemed him not he become this so he could relate to you listen to the meanings of these words as I said life's not studying I was just overwhelmed by them the word despise means to be held in contempt disdained to be deemed despicable so that's the way people looked at the Lord Jesus he was Despicable and he did that for who for the Despicable to be despicable to be vile and to be worthless worthless worthless he was worth everything was he not but the way they looked at him he was worthless he's despised and rejected of men so he was not admitted into the communication or Fellowship with the lowest of humanity many of the scam as we would call them of the Earth was respected more than he was dear Lord Jesus why he was deemed unworthy born illegitimate born out of wedlock so they thought claimed God was his father a man like that has ever been slided before by people oh really why I thought there'd been more than that how many's ever feel like people just kind of ignored you you know they'd see so and so and so and so and boy they just make over them and they'd look at you and look right at you and you think yeah I am as big as an elephant they don't even see me and it it hurts you don't it it hurts you now if you're not careful that hurt will turn into resentment and that resentment will turn into anger and then you'll find yourself having something against that individual and sometimes it's true that people just don't see us they really don't see us and they don't mean it but yet it goes to building a complex in our minds and the prophet said you imagine that someone has something against you and said really they don't but you imagine they do and in your imagination you imagine that it's there and it goes to build up and he said the next thing you know you won't even speak to that person and it's only in your imagination but it was not in Jesus imagination he could hear them whispering they told me he said he was he was a hero he was this one of the Lord have mercy don't even have fellowship with him despised oh God a Man of Sorrows and the word sorrow is pain and it means both physical pain and mental pain so Jesus suffered the physical pain in his body but he also suffered mentally of being rejected not having very many friends when we come right down to it even his disciples went away from him is that right so no matter how low friends you and I have ever been none of us have ever been where he lived and why was it necessary for him to go this way because he knew you and I the making of a gentile bride that we would not only need healing in our bodies but we would need healing from rejection we would need healing from people that want nothing to do with us and some of you have been rejected by mothers fathers by loved ones and Jesus told us it would be that way so we would not be discouraged but all brother Donna you you can't relate to it you know maybe I cannot relate to your hurt but he can he can relate to no matter what you've been through he can relate to it and he can turn it and make you a woman Bride As it were to be one who is after God's Own Heart a woman that he could say many other women have done excellently but thou excellous above them all that was what was said about Bathsheba thou excellous above them all what a woman what a woman what a bride let me close we hear it as it were our faces from him he was despised we esteemed him not you know Isaiah when he prophesied this he said he was a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief in other words he was known by grief I find this amazing that how many of us miss this is one of the attributes of the Lord Jesus that many of us would identify him only by healing brother Daryl would identify him only by Miracles but Jesus partially was known by being hurt can you imagine he was persecuted from the day he was born until the day he died the Lord Jesus grief was such an acquaintance it was around him every day of his life everywhere he went there was grief and sorrow and pain and hurt he was a Man of Sorrows acquainted grief was one of his daily acquaintances oh I'm sure he had Joy I'm sure that there was such happiness inside of him but ended amazing the Bible doesn't say it that way the Bible does not identify him as being acquainted with shouting and the Lord Jesus was just this happy Christian that went around dancing all the time there's no scripture that even says he ever danced at all but his acquaintance was grief oh Lord God why for us his constant companion his constant conversant that was there talking to him grief he was oppressed I found this word amazing to press to drive down to exert demanding pressure oh man a task Massacre or a ruler a tyrant to be hard-pressed he was oppressed and he was afflicted to be bowed down to put down to be depressed can you imagine the Lord Jesus being depressed how many has ever been depressed just feel so sad and you go through things and you know how we are whenever the Lord will allow tests and trials to keep going and going and the pressure bills and bills and oh my we get to a place and then what do we do we go to saying things oh I can't take it no more I I can't handle it I just can't go out I can't do it God if you don't help me I'm going to quit a cat I can't take it no more I can't take it now let's be honest and truthful the most of the time for a seed of God that is not their heart speaking that's the weariness of their human Spirit that's their anxiety how many has ever said it oh lord I can't I just can't go no farther Lord I just can't do it and it ain't tomorrow you're wide open again you don't feel one bit better but you say devil out of my way I shouldn't have mumbled that stuff get out of my way dab on the devil here's what you say he said he don't mean that a bit more nothing I know him but you know what he'll turn right around and condemn you for what you said in your moment of weakness and the Lord Jesus allowed himself to feel depression passion some of you young people think you've got a right to be depressed because you're rejected by other young people in our church or other young people in the message you ain't felt nothing compared to what her Lord lets her but he went lower than you would ever be able to go so he could Encompass every human being on the earth that would trust him not only for salvation but Redemption from depression Oh Glory to God Hallelujah blessed Lord God in the name of Jesus every demon out of hell here today that tries to depress God's people Satan I call your bluff you are defeated you are a liar Satan Hallelujah every

no doubt they told her to do but they could not help her oh but one day she heard about a man coming through town it was a man that was despised and rejected he didn't have a great reputation he

times I cannot stop drinking I've tried everything blessed sis have you tried Jesus you just lay your alcohol right here and take his forgiveness take his freedom enjoy his freedom I'll never forget it I begin to pray for that young girl she began to scream I'm free I'm free and by the grace of God I was there just you're so ago she came up to me she said brother that's been two years and I'm still sober I said you see because whom the son is made free is free indeed Barabbas that day of that jail cell the door was open said you're free he said in your trick you want to you want me to go

come and said trouble the master no more your little girl's gone it's over but Jesus gave him the antidote to every negative report he just touched him on the shoulder and said only believe I know friends I see it every day of my life he opens the blinded eyes and he makes the lame to walk he's our God I'm no longer a slave to fear oh cause I am a child I know I'm no longer slave to feed oh I

is science I sent and said it brother Brown prayed for his church and prayed for himself and asked God to forgive them and he wanted God to forgive them not for drinking not from lying running around committing adultery but he asks that God would forgive them for their sinful fears I saw what a statement that God would forgive them for their fears I'd say there's probably more than just Branham Tabernacle that needs that today he's done so much for us why would we fear and yet we do and if we're not careful he'll overwhelm us I mean those it's the truth but having no unique God's help today to help you get away from those sinful fears God bless you such a privilege for us to be together today remember the Harry sing and it will will be dismissed as you feel that you want to go service here again Wednesday night we had to put a few more protection things up in front of the heat pumps at the church so we've got 14 more of those to put up tomorrow and they'll come hopefully and inspect it and we're hoping they'll come again and inspect again and inspect again I wonder if the Lord's kind of teach us a lesson about these Johnson City inspectors that sort of sort of the way our life is that we think we're doing so good and in the Holy Ghost goes to inspector said uh oh that right there in your life fix it or you ain't going man amen let's fix it so we can leave amen amen how many wants to leave Holiday Inn I put my oven if I can get it up I sat back here and freeze to death there's no heat back there so I sat back on free said if I have my coat on I commend you know how to burn up I go back out there after church and I freeze to death again that's just part of my complaints we want to get everything inspected so we can get ready to move and move in oh there's a home waiting for us no trouble no heartache no anxiety let's get ready so we can be inspected when the inspector will pull the door down said you're ready to go you're ready to go you're ready to go you're
