[24:23] us praise the Lord so grateful that we
[24:27] could be gather
[24:28] together again tonight first of all
[24:30] before I start answering questions I
[24:32] want to apologize to you that it's been
[24:34] a little while before I've been able to
[24:36] u to do them we scheduled last Thursday
[24:39] as I mentioned it and uh couldn't do it
[24:42] and scheduled of course before and some
[24:45] of these questions I've had for a month
[24:47] maybe brother Rob some want you sent to
[24:49] me maybe six weeks so I appreciate you
[24:53] being patient with me um but but the
[24:55] ones I've got so far we'll probably be
[24:58] into the third year of the
[25:01] Millennium believe me I've got a bunch
[25:03] of them but I've enjoyed studying them
[25:06] and uh I think it's going to be a a
[25:08] blessing to you there's a young brother
[25:10] from our church here that had U several
[25:13] questions and um his mom and dad asked
[25:16] Carol and I if we would come over one
[25:18] night and eat supper with him and um
[25:20] help him with those questions and we did
[25:23] that and U I asked him if it would be
[25:26] all right if I would add those questions
[25:29] also to the U questions that we have
[25:33] I'll not tell you who it is and I told
[25:34] him that I wouldn't so um with what was
[25:38] turned into brother Rob and brother Joe
[25:40] and the ones that were also email to me
[25:42] uh plus those we've got a bunch but I've
[25:45] already enjoyed studing them and I just
[25:48] trust it'll be a blessing let's just
[25:50] pray together before we U look into
[25:52] these
[25:54] questions Lord Jesus we count it such an
[25:56] honor that we would be able to be
[25:58] gathered here tonight I look out upon
[26:01] this group of young people and my heart
[26:03] just jumps for Joy thinking Lord they
[26:07] could be out drinking running around
[26:09] partying doing all kinds of different
[26:12] things but they wanted to come to church
[26:15] again tonight and they were just here
[26:17] last night they had questions on their
[26:19] hearts and maybe some of them didn't ask
[26:22] the question but I just trust that as I
[26:26] answer the questions for those who did
[26:28] ask it there will be others that will be
[26:30] benefited and blessed by it not only in
[26:33] the visible audience but also those
[26:36] that'll go back in streaming I know the
[26:37] ones that we had before I heard from
[26:40] people all over the world that were so
[26:42] benefited and blessed by these questions
[26:46] we thank you Lord that we have people
[26:48] that desire to know what's right what's
[26:51] wrong how can I please the Lord how can
[26:53] I serve him better Lord Jesus you've
[26:56] told us blessed are they that hunger and
[26:58] thirst after righteousness for they
[27:01] shall be filled help us tonight help me
[27:03] Lord to get out of the way Lord God help
[27:06] me that I wouldn't say anything wrong
[27:08] help me that I would never ever Lord not
[27:11] just tonight but ever in my life ever
[27:14] say anything that would lead anyone
[27:17] astray it's my desire father to be a
[27:20] faithful and true Shepherd help me Lord
[27:23] God I pray in the name of Jesus and
[27:26] everybody said amen amen God bless you
[27:30] you can be
[27:32] seated thank the Lord certainly
[27:34] appreciate each of you for coming
[27:35] tonight would just remember me in prayer
[27:38] uh you know I I I so
[27:40] appreciate um brother brandham taking
[27:43] question and answers because he was
[27:45] actually the first preacher of all the
[27:47] preachers that I knew in Pentecost and
[27:49] the different churches that I've been
[27:50] into I'd never heard or seen of a
[27:54] preacher that actually did question and
[27:57] answers
[27:58] and I thought it was kind of tricky you
[28:00] know in one way doing question and
[28:01] answers and I've done them in different
[28:03] places around the world and believe me
[28:05] it can be tricky especially if you just
[28:07] walk up on the platform and they're
[28:09] laying there I don't like them that way
[28:11] I like to have scriptures and things to
[28:13] be able to um you know answer it well
[28:16] but what I so appreciate about uh the
[28:19] questions and answers that the prophet
[28:20] did was that the message itself him
[28:22] preaching is God using him to speak to
[28:26] us question answers are things that
[28:28] maybe the people didn't understand or
[28:32] something that brother brandham because
[28:33] of you know all the stuff that he was
[28:35] trying to cover it just left it out you
[28:37] know as well as I do no matter how long
[28:38] a man's been preaching how great of a
[28:40] speaker that he is he's not going to be
[28:42] able to answer every question sometimes
[28:44] you'll preach a sermon and you'll leave
[28:46] spots out you don't intend to but you
[28:48] just can't cover it all so sometimes the
[28:51] questions will help be able to clarify
[28:53] something and for myself I've got so
[28:56] many things even dealings with doctrines
[28:59] out of the question and answers that
[29:00] just clarifies it so much and part of
[29:03] these are are going to be um in the same
[29:07] way as we go to looking at them but the
[29:09] first one that I I mentioned to you last
[29:11] night that I wanted to uh deal with
[29:13] tonight which is why that I spoke in the
[29:15] direction that I did and the question is
[29:18] how do I know that I have the Holy Ghost
[29:22] now truly that's one of the greatest
[29:23] questions that all of us can have at
[29:26] that St stage in our spiritual walk with
[29:29] God after that is settled for an
[29:32] individual then it won't have as much
[29:34] significance as it did before they got
[29:37] the assurance and we believe that this
[29:39] message not only comes to uh restore our
[29:42] faith back to the original fathers but
[29:44] it comes to give us an assurance to
[29:47] where we can have a confidence down
[29:49] inside of us because after all if we
[29:51] come to church if we sing if we do all
[29:54] kinds of things we play music we're kind
[29:56] to people and we do lots of good things
[29:58] like that good deeds and we still miss
[30:01] the Holy Ghost what good has it done us
[30:03] so if you went to church every day of
[30:05] our life so to be able to know and be
[30:07] sure that we have the Holy Ghost that is
[30:10] a very great thing and it's not just
[30:12] showing people that have those questions
[30:14] I have to answer that many times in my
[30:16] office dealing with h maybe some of your
[30:18] fathers and mothers even some of your
[30:20] grandfathers and grandmothers and I've
[30:22] been asked that question around the
[30:23] world because it's something that people
[30:26] want to know and to make sure because in
[30:29] reality with your walk before God what
[30:31] is the greatest and foremost question
[30:33] that you'd be able to have to know that
[30:36] you have in your heart that ticket as it
[30:39] was that you are going in the Rapture is
[30:43] there any greater thing is there any
[30:45] greater question that can be asked once
[30:47] you have that Assurance even in time you
[30:50] will still wonder I hear preachers
[30:52] preach sermons and as long as I believe
[30:54] I've had the Holy Ghost I still will say
[30:57] Lord I just want to make sure I want to
[30:59] make sure everything is okay Lord maybe
[31:02] I just need a refilling any of y'all
[31:04] ever done that because you just feel
[31:06] like you just want to make sure that
[31:09] everything is all right between you and
[31:11] God now I didn't get to this uh last
[31:14] night because I run out of time but
[31:16] there's a lot of things that the Holy
[31:18] Ghost is um St John 14:16 Jesus said
[31:21] I'll pray the father and he shall give
[31:23] you another comforter that he may abide
[31:26] with you forever even the spirit of
[31:30] Truth whom the world cannot receive so
[31:34] this verse within itself proves to us
[31:37] that a sinner coming out of one of these
[31:39] chairs here coming up to give his heart
[31:42] to God cannot receive the Holy Ghost and
[31:45] you know according to what many
[31:46] denominational people believe that
[31:48] whenever you get forgiveness of your
[31:50] sins you get it all in one lump sum not
[31:53] according to Jesus you can't a sinner
[31:56] cannot receive receive the Holy Ghost
[31:58] the comforter he can forg receive
[32:01] forgiveness of his sins and receive
[32:03] pardon but this is another stage and
[32:06] Jesus calls this in verse 17 the spirit
[32:09] of truth I want you to keep that in mind
[32:12] because there's a spirit of Truth and a
[32:14] spirit of error and we don't just want
[32:17] the truth we want the spirit of truth
[32:20] that goes with it because the truth can
[32:24] be attained by anybody that would just
[32:26] simply take the Bible or take a message
[32:29] book or take a message tape and they say
[32:31] well I I've got the truth but if you
[32:34] don't have the spirit of Truth you won't
[32:36] be able to stay in that truth and it's
[32:38] the same way with error and the spirit
[32:40] of error probably every one of us here
[32:42] tonight are believing things that are
[32:44] wrong we just don't know it yet but if
[32:46] the word shows us something tonight and
[32:48] speaks to us and we'll say oh my
[32:50] goodness I didn't realize I I was
[32:52] believing that wrong Lord I am so sorry
[32:55] well that didn't mean you had the Spirit
[32:57] of error that just mean it hadn't been
[32:59] shown to you but people who have the
[33:02] spirit of error when you show them the
[33:05] truth they still will not accept the
[33:07] truth so it's not that they're looking
[33:09] at error at face value and truths at
[33:12] face value but what's behind it is a
[33:15] spirit which is motivating them and
[33:18] believe me in all my years of minist
[33:19] I've de dealt with many people that are
[33:22] in the spirit of error you can send them
[33:24] page after page of scriptures and quotes
[33:27] and they will not even acknowledge them
[33:30] to be the truth I did that not long ago
[33:32] to a message preacher I sent him page
[33:35] after page after page after page of
[33:39] scriptures and quotes he never even
[33:41] acknowledged them to be the truth so I
[33:45] realized I thought well maybe the man is
[33:47] just an heor you know and what he's
[33:49] doing his standing on this certain
[33:51] certain subject and all that I thought
[33:53] maybe he's just he don't know any better
[33:56] so I thought well I I figured the best
[33:58] thing to do is send him the truth and
[34:00] see what his reaction is now anybody
[34:02] with the Holy Ghost will always
[34:05] acknowledge the word to be right and
[34:07] themsel to be wrong now remember we're
[34:10] answering this question how do I know I
[34:12] have the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will
[34:15] never in us will never put our feelings
[34:19] our opinion or mama or daddy or anyone
[34:22] else above the word of God and the young
[34:25] people said amen because why the Holy
[34:28] Ghost is the spirit of Truth and we've
[34:31] all had to come to that spot I know that
[34:32] will continue to do so and this is why
[34:35] we know we do have the Holy Ghost is
[34:37] because the spirit in us will always say
[34:40] Amen to the word and it'll say forgive
[34:43] me Lord forgive me Lord I'm sorry but if
[34:47] we have the truths at face value but in
[34:50] our hearts we have the spirit of error
[34:53] then we will take reasoning we will take
[34:55] well yeah yeah but but you know you know
[34:58] well you know you know how it is you
[35:00] know well see that person is motivated
[35:03] by the spirit of error now another thing
[35:05] I always go by and uh this is just a
[35:08] little preacher Insight whenever I'm
[35:10] dealing with somebody and um I give them
[35:13] something in the word and uh they always
[35:16] come back I give them something else
[35:17] they always come back with something
[35:19] else I give them something they always
[35:20] come back and I realize by knowing that
[35:23] individual that they're really not that
[35:25] smart and I know that they really don't
[35:29] understand the word that well to be able
[35:31] to produce that type of argument I
[35:33] realize I'm dealing with a person under
[35:36] the influence of a demon and that demon
[35:40] is actually anointing them and giving
[35:43] them the thoughts in their mind because
[35:46] they're under the spirit of error now if
[35:48] they were just believing error and they
[35:50] had a sincere heart and they wanted to
[35:52] be true and right before God then they
[35:55] would acknowledge hey brother I had seen
[35:57] that before thank you so much for
[35:59] sending me that oh pray for me pray for
[36:01] me that's a person with a sincere heart
[36:04] and a person also that has the spirit of
[36:06] Truth on them a person that wants to be
[36:08] right and they want to be able to be
[36:10] corrected so the truth can correct him
[36:13] so notice what Jesus said even the
[36:15] spirit of Truth whom the world cannot
[36:16] receive because it seeth him not neither
[36:19] knoweth him but ye know him now watch
[36:23] this excerpt into the godhead because
[36:26] you you you'll never be able to really
[36:27] receive the Holy Ghost and be able to
[36:29] see your position of who you are until
[36:32] the Myster of the godhead becomes more
[36:33] open to you now why didn't Jesus just
[36:35] come right out and say it it's not
[36:37] written that way it's written for the
[36:39] initiated those that are baptized into
[36:41] the kingdom of God to be able to
[36:43] understand it notice what he says he
[36:45] said the world cannot receive it because
[36:47] it seeth in not neither knoweth him but
[36:51] ye know him for he dwelleth with you and
[36:55] shall be in you you who's he talking
[36:58] about well he's talking about
[37:01] himself in another
[37:03] form in another form so as I said last
[37:06] night it's the part of God that can be
[37:08] divided how he has God in your heart
[37:10] tonight you have him in one form or
[37:11] another justification sanctification
[37:13] baptism the Holy Ghost well there's no
[37:15] way in the world we have the body of
[37:17] Jesus and our and our human body of
[37:20] course but it is that portion of the
[37:22] spirit of God so Jesus as the humanity
[37:25] of God did not come back on the day of
[37:28] Pentecost but he come back in the form
[37:31] of the Son of God which is holy spirit
[37:34] which could be divided again in St John
[37:37] 15:26 but when the comforters come whom
[37:40] I will send unto you from the father
[37:43] even the spirit of Truth Now notice what
[37:46] the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost is the
[37:49] spirit of Truth which proceedeth from
[37:53] the father he shall testify of me St
[37:57] John 16:13 how be it when he the spirit
[38:01] of Truth Jesus just keeps saying it over
[38:04] and over again that one thing that the
[38:06] Holy Ghost is he's an advocate he's a
[38:09] paracletos one called alongside to help
[38:11] us to act as your lawyer he is a rest he
[38:14] is a comforter He Is A Healer he's our
[38:17] righteousness but he is the spirit of
[38:21] truth and you know it's one thing that
[38:23] I've found about real genuine Christians
[38:26] around the message no matter how long
[38:28] they've been around how many tapes
[38:30] they've listened to and how many years
[38:32] that they've been in the message they
[38:33] always have a teachable spirit a spirit
[38:37] to where that they they come to the
[38:40] house of God and they don't come with a
[38:42] know-it-all attitude there's one
[38:44] particular man that I know that lives up
[38:46] up in Indiana and uh lives lives around
[38:49] the Tabernacle area there and he was
[38:51] talking to a friend of mine several
[38:52] years ago and I was going up there to
[38:54] preach and he said why don't you come
[38:55] and hear this brother yeah yeah he said
[38:57] that brother I'll tell you what he'll
[38:58] just be a blessing to you and this man
[39:00] didn't believe in going to church of
[39:02] course he didn't believe in Preachers
[39:03] and he said I want you to hand me my
[39:06] Hebrews book I want you to hand me my
[39:09] seals book so his wife hands him his
[39:11] book he said I want you to tell me any
[39:15] preacher that can tell me anything in
[39:18] this book that I don't
[39:22] know well the truth of it was he didn't
[39:25] know Hardy nothing in at all why that
[39:29] attitude you see he didn't have the Holy
[39:31] Ghost because the Holy Ghost is the
[39:35] spirit of Truth you imagine brother
[39:37] brandham said every time he would open
[39:39] his Bible and read from his Bible he
[39:43] would find something in there that he
[39:46] hadn't read
[39:47] before you imagine him whenever he's
[39:50] preaching the seals and he said I would
[39:53] have made a horrible mistake today
[39:57] because you know what he was fixing to
[39:58] do he was fixing to call that white
[40:01] horse rider what he had called him for
[40:04] years the Lord Jesus brother brandom for
[40:08] years and years whenever he'd read that
[40:09] from The Book of Revelation whenever
[40:12] John saw that white horse rider come
[40:14] conquering and to conquer and he called
[40:17] that white horse rider the Lord
[40:19] Jesus you imagine how he must have felt
[40:22] brother Rob that day when the angel of
[40:24] God come into his room and said you've
[40:27] been
[40:28] wrong all these
[40:30] years well if he gets up and says that
[40:34] says that isn't that going to be
[40:37] embarrassing now aren't people going to
[40:40] take that tape where he preached Mighty
[40:43] conquer in 57 Mighty conquer in 58
[40:46] Mighty conquer again in 60 aren't they
[40:49] going to take that and compare it now
[40:52] look you said here and you said there
[40:54] and now you're saying you're wrong
[40:57] but you see he had the Holy Ghost so the
[41:00] Holy Ghost could be able to say you're
[41:03] wrong and he would be able to stand up
[41:05] and say I was
[41:08] wrong how many can do that here
[41:10] tonight okay I'm stopping right now I'm
[41:13] making an aler
[41:15] call you see the spirit of Truth in
[41:18] every one of us knows that we've always
[41:22] got more room to grow do you brother
[41:24] Donnie are you kidding me
[41:26] the more I study and the more I look
[41:28] into this word the more I realize how
[41:31] much I don't know not how much I
[41:35] do what I brought to you there last
[41:37] night about the angels of God and them
[41:40] opening up and peering into that realm I
[41:42] was sitting that when I was up in
[41:43] Virginia there in a hotel last week I
[41:46] just about exploded all over that hotel
[41:48] room I thought how many times have I
[41:51] read that in the Bible you see as long
[41:54] as we have the Holy Ghost in us then
[41:56] there's an Avenue which is constantly
[41:58] open this is why Jesus uses these words
[42:00] of course how be it when either Spirit
[42:02] of Truth has come he will guide you into
[42:04] all Truth for he shall not speak of
[42:06] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[42:09] that shall he speak and he will show you
[42:13] things to come so notice what the Holy
[42:16] Ghost is doing constantly
[42:20] updating where you are now he's not just
[42:23] going to show you things
[42:26] that have been but things that are to be
[42:31] so as the spirit of God will speak
[42:33] through the ministers in this day get
[42:35] ready for this get ready for that pray
[42:37] you know trim your lamps all that a
[42:39] child of God with the Holy Ghost they
[42:41] hear that they say yes Lord Jesus I want
[42:43] to with all of my heart why they have
[42:45] the spirit of Truth in them and that
[42:47] spirit in them when they hear a man of
[42:49] God preach that they say that's the
[42:51] truth that's nothing but the truth I
[42:53] need to tighten up the armor a little
[42:55] bit I need to to pray more I need to
[42:57] read my Bible I need to do this and this
[42:59] and this why the spirit of Truth in them
[43:02] says Amen to what they're hearing
[43:04] preached notice in 1 John 3: 14 John
[43:10] gives us another little insight and to
[43:12] how that we know when we passed from
[43:15] Death un life we know that we have
[43:18] passed from Death un life because we
[43:21] love the Brethren he that loveth not his
[43:25] brother Abid Us in death now is there
[43:28] one evidence now of course me coming
[43:31] from the Pentecostal background and I
[43:33] was taught for many many years and
[43:35] actually preached it that way that
[43:37] speaking in tongues was the evidence of
[43:38] the Holy Ghost and that's why the
[43:40] Pentecostals would so emphasize it even
[43:44] though I could not explain how some of
[43:46] those people that spoke in tongues and
[43:48] shouted and run and danced and jumped
[43:50] and everything else and yet 6 months
[43:54] they'd be backslid drinking smoking
[43:56] running around I had no explanation for
[43:58] that how could God ever seal them and
[44:01] yet they been able to do such a thing
[44:03] but whenever you look and see for us
[44:06] it's it's a little bit more complicated
[44:08] because they say well if it was just one
[44:10] evidence what if I just if I you know if
[44:12] I shake my head a certain way everybody
[44:14] that shakes your head like this has got
[44:16] the Holy Ghost well you think the devil
[44:18] can't do that too sure he could so it's
[44:22] a
[44:23] multiplicity of many things that the
[44:26] spirit of God will do out of our lives
[44:30] that includes love that includes the
[44:32] fruits of the spirit that includes
[44:35] obedience to words that you don't even
[44:37] know yet but when the spirit of God will
[44:39] bring it to you the holy spirit in you
[44:42] will Quicken your life to match that
[44:45] word but John says we know then that we
[44:48] passed now it's not I'm I'm hoping well
[44:52] I I'm really hoping that that I have no
[44:55] no we can absolutely know that we have
[44:58] passed from death into life and then
[45:01] John remembered that the Apostle of love
[45:03] and he said how be it or rather we know
[45:06] that we have passed from Death unto life
[45:08] because we love the Brethren now that
[45:11] remember that's not just from our mouth
[45:13] but that's indeed also and again 1 John
[45:16] 4:6 we are of God he that knoweth God
[45:20] heareth us he that is notice not of God
[45:26] here is not us hereby know we the spirit
[45:29] of
[45:30] truth and the
[45:32] spirit of error so there were already
[45:36] people in this first church age and
[45:40] actually some of them were preachers and
[45:42] they were already preaching things that
[45:44] was contrary to the word and John
[45:47] identifies them drop Fe of course is
[45:49] mentioned here in this this Epistle of
[45:51] John Dr was a rich businessman and he
[45:55] John said that he writes about him calls
[45:57] his name and said that we we would have
[46:00] come to him but does wouldn't let
[46:04] us now you imagine how in the world
[46:06] would them people them saints of God
[46:09] ever allowed a businessman to keep an
[46:12] apostle like John from coming to the
[46:15] church and preaching I've never
[46:17] understood that to save my life you
[46:19] think that have had a revolt and said
[46:21] doct tropies sit down and shut up who do
[46:26] you think you are you're going to keep
[46:28] the great Apostle John and by this time
[46:32] he's the only Apostle left all the rest
[46:35] of them are done dead but this man had
[46:38] such a hold on the congregation that he
[46:42] had more persuasion than what the
[46:45] Apostle John did so he s John again
[46:48] identifies and says listen you want to
[46:50] know if you've got the spirit of truth
[46:53] if you've got the spirit of Truth you
[46:55] will hear us and if you've got the
[46:58] spirit of error you
[47:02] won't pretty good identification is it
[47:05] not well we go on the same way then and
[47:07] say in this day if God has sent us a
[47:10] prophet and if people have the spirit of
[47:12] Truth they will hear what he's got to
[47:15] say if they have the spirit of error
[47:18] they won't now watch brother random of
[47:20] course deals with it in many different
[47:23] sermons and I'm sure many of you have
[47:24] read or listen to the tapes but in
[47:26] broken sisters he says in St John 14
[47:28] Jesus said when the Holy Ghost has come
[47:30] upon you he will reveal these things to
[47:32] you that I've taught you and show you
[47:35] things to come there is the genuine
[47:38] evidence of the Holy Ghost he has never
[47:42] told me anything wrong yet now notice
[47:45] how he explains this it is the evidence
[47:47] of the Holy Ghost is he who can believe
[47:52] the word you can receive it cuz Jesus
[47:55] never said when the Holy Ghost has come
[47:57] you'll speak with tongues he never said
[47:59] the Holy Ghost come you do any of those
[48:01] things but he said he will take these
[48:02] things of mine and show them to you and
[48:07] will show you things that is to come
[48:09] there is the genuine evidence of the
[48:12] Holy Ghost According To Jesus himself so
[48:17] all these Sensations and things that
[48:20] people have and still live on now we
[48:24] believe in Emotion don't we we believe
[48:26] the presence of God can come my goodness
[48:29] I'll tell you it was here so great last
[48:31] night I staggered under the presence of
[48:34] God my fingers started going numb the
[48:37] anointing coming out of me as I was
[48:39] ministering to the people of God yeah
[48:41] does it come with feelings yes does it
[48:44] come with emotions it does but them
[48:46] emotions ain't God all kinds of people
[48:50] have emotions you ever get scared
[48:52] somebody just stand out from a corner
[48:54] and say Bo and it just scare you you
[48:56] ever had cold chills to run up your
[48:58] spine does that mean there a holy ghost
[49:00] chill no it was your fear you were
[49:02] traumatized and you feel like smacking
[49:04] them in the
[49:06] face but does it come with that yes but
[49:10] that's not the Holy Ghost itself notice
[49:12] in question answer 64 there's one
[49:15] evidence of the holy spirit that I know
[49:17] of and that is a genuine facei now
[49:21] remember there can be a make believe
[49:24] Faith that's what Judas
[49:26] had Judas healed the sick
[49:31] preached cast out
[49:33] Devils he was in the 70 that was sent
[49:36] out in Matthew 10 we don't know who his
[49:39] buddy was but there was somebody went
[49:42] with Judas and Judas was not the type of
[49:46] preacher that had no Sons he had signs
[49:50] following his
[49:52] ministry so he would cast out devils lay
[49:56] hands on the sick and then recover no
[49:58] doubt Judas was a mighty
[50:01] preacher Prophet tells us in the church
[50:03] age book his ministry was not inferior
[50:07] to any of the rest Apostles and you've
[50:08] heard me preach it many of you since you
[50:09] was a young young children but Judas was
[50:13] not the type of guy that was all the
[50:15] time flirting with the women and he was
[50:17] all the time sneaking around drinking or
[50:20] as would say smoking and everybody knew
[50:22] man that guy you know oh I ain't got no
[50:24] confidence in him but when Jesus sat at
[50:27] the communion table and said one of you
[50:29] is going to betray me they questioned
[50:33] thems before they questioned
[50:36] him now you know if this guy was obvious
[50:39] everybody would say Jesus said one he
[50:41] was going to betray me that said Judas
[50:43] Judas Judas Judas Judas Judas Judas
[50:46] Judas everybody would have known who it
[50:48] was but he was so close to them they
[50:52] didn't even know it as a matter of fact
[50:56] they never set the way we do and eat but
[51:00] they laid reclined on a Dean as it's
[51:04] called so they would have laid kind of
[51:07] sideways John was laying on one side of
[51:10] Jesus Judas was laying on the other
[51:14] whenever the apostles would have walked
[51:16] in and the Lord Jesus would have told
[51:18] them where to
[51:19] set and they looked to see where Judas
[51:23] was the way they would have looked at
[51:26] the rightand position they would have
[51:28] had it in their mind Judas is the next
[51:34] leader little did they know he was the
[51:39] betrayer but looking at signs just like
[51:43] the rest of them wonders just like the
[51:46] rest of them Miracles just like the rest
[51:48] of them that's why we cannot go by signs
[51:53] alone right now we believe in signs
[51:56] thank God God performed some here last
[51:58] night God did some great things right
[52:00] here among us but that within itself is
[52:03] not the evidence of the Holy Ghost now
[52:06] notice he says it is a genuine faith in
[52:10] the promised
[52:12] word of the
[52:14] hour so it's not enough just to preach
[52:17] Noah's message it's not enough to preach
[52:20] the law it's not enough just to preach
[52:22] about the day of Pentecost but we've got
[52:25] to have the message of this
[52:27] hour now those Jews come and they had
[52:30] more religion than the disciples had
[52:33] they were better trained men in the
[52:36] scriptures than the disciples were
[52:40] because they were fishermen tax
[52:41] collectors and so forth they had real
[52:44] faith and genuine
[52:47] faith in what they were doing now listen
[52:51] how close those men were these men these
[52:55] scribes Pharisees theen Sadducees all
[52:57] they were they had genuine faith not a
[53:00] make believe Faith a genuine faith and
[53:03] what they were doing and they were as
[53:05] sincere as they could be but the word of
[53:08] the hour made
[53:10] flesh they said this man's a
[53:13] be so it wasn't that you could ever
[53:16] condemn them on the law they knew that
[53:20] law so well my my they knew that law and
[53:23] they believed that law but it was the
[53:25] word of the hour that proved who they
[53:29] were just like it'll prove
[53:32] us notice this who do you say this is
[53:35] evidence of the Holy Ghost is believing
[53:38] his word always been in every age if you
[53:41] can receive the word those priests had
[53:45] Jesus beat a million miles when it come
[53:48] to fruits of the spirit now you imagine
[53:51] they were so kind and so loving and so
[53:56] gentle boy that's a kind of preacher
[53:58] love that's what the Le c age loved on
[54:01] it they want to go just say how's
[54:03] everybody doing tonight now Little
[54:06] Darlings y'all are just so sweet every
[54:10] one of you is just as perfect as you can
[54:12] be why Jesus knows you can't live right
[54:16] well how many y'all sin today well
[54:18] that's all right honey I have to you
[54:21] know you drunk a little bit well I have
[54:24] two
[54:25] that's the kind of preacher they want
[54:27] youall don't want that kind do
[54:29] you brother Andrew Spencer was telling
[54:31] me the other day of a of a guy that they
[54:33] was talking about or the guy that had
[54:35] told them and said yeah I said I reckon
[54:37] we're going to have to get rid of our
[54:38] our pastor he said oh really he said
[54:40] yeah yeah Baptist Church said yeah we're
[54:42] going to have to get going to have to
[54:43] get rid of it said well what's in the
[54:45] world's going on he said he said every
[54:47] social event that we have whether it's a
[54:50] baby shower or a wedding shower whatever
[54:53] it is he's getting wor every time he
[54:56] comes he shows up
[55:00] drunk can you imagine a pastor showing
[55:05] up
[55:07] drunk is that what religion has come
[55:11] to is that what it's come to that the
[55:16] preachers oh God help
[55:18] us and yet they would ridicule us well
[55:22] don't sit there look at me funny I may
[55:23] not show up drunk but I do leave drunk
[55:27] sometimes I'm hoping some of you all do
[55:30] as well but drunk on the Holy Ghost is
[55:32] that right but notice when it would come
[55:35] to being Meek and nice and oh so gentle
[55:40] and just you know Jesus a sort of a
[55:42] rough kind of guy you imagine John the
[55:45] Baptist being the pastor of Word of Life
[55:49] Church oh John come out of that door
[55:51] over there with camel hair on him
[55:55] had a little bit of Honey on his on his
[55:57] mouth where he hadn't used his napkin
[55:59] wasn't a very clean sort of a guy ate
[56:01] Locust for supper and Wild Honey come
[56:05] out of there like a blazing fire and
[56:09] said bring forth fruits for repentance
[56:12] you got to repent get right with God
[56:14] y'all think I'm hard I'm like a Boy
[56:16] Scout compared to John the Baptist and
[56:19] then you imagine them other guys oh
[56:22] children come come to pap
[56:26] oh you went over and heard that old
[56:28] rough guy didn't you yeah I did he hurt
[56:31] my feeling so bad oh come here honey
[56:35] come
[56:37] here then Jesus comes out on the scene
[56:41] he said you generation of
[56:45] snakes oh my goodness St John 8:44 you
[56:50] are of your father the
[56:53] devil
[56:55] and you know who he was saying that to
[56:59] preachers
[57:02] wow so you imagine the next Sunday
[57:05] they'd get a well children I know how
[57:08] y'all feel cuz I went to one of them
[57:10] meetings too and he called me a snake
[57:14] well how could that be a man of God that
[57:17] ain't love they didn't know love did
[57:19] they they didn't know
[57:22] love now notice
[57:25] Jesus he said when it come to fruits of
[57:27] the spirit gentle peaceful Meek lowly he
[57:30] tore up churches kicked them over tore
[57:32] the people out called them Snakes in the
[57:35] Grass but he was that word he was that
[57:38] word that's it believe God God is the
[57:42] word so what is then the evidence how
[57:45] can you know how can I know that I have
[57:48] the Holy Ghost I will say Amen to every
[57:52] word now it's easy for us to say Amen oh
[57:55] I believe every word well what you
[57:57] should say is I can say Amen to every
[58:00] word that I know but no doubt there's a
[58:02] lot of them you ain't heard yet now
[58:05] maybe you've complied to everything that
[58:07] you've heard but there might be a sermon
[58:09] Sunday or maybe even here tonight you
[58:11] know in this question answers that
[58:12] you'll hear something oh my goodness
[58:15] it'll rub you so raw and it'll just man
[58:18] I didn't know the Bible said that I
[58:20] didn't know the prophet said that oh my
[58:22] boy that really gets right down where I
[58:24] live what am I going to do well if
[58:26] you've got the Holy Ghost you'll line up
[58:30] and you'll say thank you Lord for
[58:32] sending me the truth now that don't mean
[58:35] that it won't be a battle for you it
[58:37] will be a battle but with what this
[58:39] right here but the Holy Ghost in you the
[58:42] spirit of truth will want to bring your
[58:45] body subject to the word is that right
[58:49] notice again this day this scripture is
[58:51] fulfilled the Holy Ghost is the word of
[58:54] God in you that identifies
[58:59] Itself by accepting the word so the Holy
[59:03] Ghost then is the word of God in you so
[59:07] then how could the Holy
[59:08] Ghost in you read something out of the
[59:12] Bible or the message of the hour and say
[59:14] I just don't believe that well I I I
[59:17] just don't take that we don't believe
[59:19] that at our church well we only take
[59:22] what the prophet say when it's thus
[59:23] sayeth the Lord
[59:25] well I that was before the
[59:27] seals so is the whole new testament
[59:30] you're going to throw that
[59:32] away but notice the Holy Ghost is the
[59:35] word of God in you that identifies
[59:37] Itself by accepting the word outside of
[59:39] that it can't be the Holy Ghost if it
[59:42] says it's the Holy Spirit and denies how
[59:46] many one word of that Bible it cannot be
[59:51] the Holy Spirit that's the evidence
[59:54] whether you believe or not thinking
[59:56] man's filter now if you've got the
[59:58] evidence of the Holy Ghost a holy man or
[1:00:00] a holy woman's taste they want to live
[1:00:03] they've got eternal life because this
[1:00:06] word is quickened to them now here he's
[1:00:08] preaching on the thinking man's filter
[1:00:10] and he's going back to the desire inside
[1:00:13] of our soul but brother Donnie will I
[1:00:15] make mistakes you sure will will I fall
[1:00:19] short of the glory of God you sure will
[1:00:23] does that mean that don't have the Holy
[1:00:24] ghost it sure
[1:00:28] don't what now wait a minute Brother D
[1:00:31] once I get the Holy Ghost my mistakes
[1:00:33] are over auny who told you that
[1:00:37] lie I said who told you that lie cuz
[1:00:41] that's what that
[1:00:42] is your body ain't got the Holy Ghost
[1:00:46] and ain't never going to get it that's
[1:00:48] why this whole stinking thing's got to
[1:00:50] be
[1:00:51] changed private interview
[1:00:56] sister Georgie
[1:00:59] Bruce sister Bruce
[1:01:02] says I make so many mistakes and I fail
[1:01:06] so many times brother Brandon now
[1:01:09] responding that's why Christ had to die
[1:01:11] so that you with your mistakes wouldn't
[1:01:14] be lauded to you see he took your
[1:01:16] mistakes your desire in your heart is to
[1:01:19] serve him sister Bruce says yes all
[1:01:23] right that's what he died for so you
[1:01:24] could serve him your mistakes are not
[1:01:27] lotted to you he's your
[1:01:30] perpetuation he's your sin offering your
[1:01:33] sins are not known you're not a sinner
[1:01:35] before God Christ took your sins and
[1:01:39] became you because your desire is to
[1:01:43] serve him now listen at her sister Bruce
[1:01:46] says but I've never had an
[1:01:50] experience that I've been filled with
[1:01:52] the Holy
[1:01:53] Ghost
[1:01:55] that I notice what she says that I could
[1:01:58] put my foot
[1:02:00] on now listen to his answer all right
[1:02:03] notice ordinarily a human being is born
[1:02:05] in sin shap and iniquity come the world
[1:02:06] speaking lies that's the nature of a
[1:02:08] human being Sister Bruce says yes that
[1:02:11] was your nature it changed once but what
[1:02:14] changed it she responds Christ there you
[1:02:18] are
[1:02:19] sister he that Hearth my words and
[1:02:21] believeth on him that sent me out
[1:02:23] eternal life and shall not come into the
[1:02:25] Judgment but has past tense passed from
[1:02:27] death into life St John 5:24 Jesus
[1:02:30] speaking you're a Christian sister Bruce
[1:02:34] I've watched your life I've watched you
[1:02:38] under
[1:02:44] vision and I
[1:02:46] know you are a Christian but as far as
[1:02:49] the way sister Bruce is looking at
[1:02:52] it apparently she's not not had the type
[1:02:55] of experience that maybe she was taught
[1:02:58] maybe she had a Pentecostal background
[1:02:59] we really don't know but somehow
[1:03:02] something had never happened to her that
[1:03:05] she was thinking should happen so she's
[1:03:09] fighting this battle that I don't have
[1:03:11] the Holy Ghost I couldn't have the Holy
[1:03:14] Ghost because whatever it is she thought
[1:03:15] was going to happen has never happened
[1:03:17] to
[1:03:18] me and yet the prophet said I have
[1:03:22] watched your life
[1:03:24] I don't mind telling you if I'd have
[1:03:26] been sitting there I'd asked them where
[1:03:28] they wanted a new door you imagine God's
[1:03:31] Prophet looking at your life and say I
[1:03:33] have watched your
[1:03:36] life you are a Christian I'd rather him
[1:03:40] tell me that than I was a preacher or I
[1:03:43] was a shouter or I was a guitar player
[1:03:46] you imagine your life being watched by
[1:03:51] Vision praise God
[1:03:54] he says I know you're a Christian see
[1:03:58] I'm your Shepherd as it was Sister Bruce
[1:04:00] says yes somebody to help if there was
[1:04:04] any doubt in my mind if I thought there
[1:04:07] was something wrong with you I'd tell
[1:04:11] you sister Bruce I believe
[1:04:15] that but if there's anything wrong in
[1:04:17] your experience anything between you and
[1:04:22] God as far as I know anything about it
[1:04:25] sister Bruce there's not a
[1:04:30] thing there's
[1:04:32] not a
[1:04:35] sing praise God so you mean act a person
[1:04:39] can genuinely receive the Holy Ghost
[1:04:42] they can still have questions in their
[1:04:44] mind whether or not they've got him yeah
[1:04:47] it all depends on what they're looking
[1:04:49] at and how they're saying okay now a
[1:04:51] person with the Holy Ghost will do this
[1:04:53] and this and this and this and this
[1:04:55] first of all make sure the requirement
[1:04:57] that you're setting is a scriptural
[1:05:01] requirement because if Satan cannot
[1:05:03] convince you one way he'll try to
[1:05:05] convince you another if he wants to
[1:05:08] convince you that you do have the Holy
[1:05:10] Ghost when you don't he will lower the
[1:05:12] standard and bring it down to your level
[1:05:14] if you do have it and he wants to
[1:05:16] convince you that you don't he will
[1:05:18] raise the standard so high that
[1:05:21] absolutely nobody including your Pastor
[1:05:25] has got it so what you want to have your
[1:05:27] standard is God's
[1:05:30] word and the young people said amen was
[1:05:33] that
[1:05:35] clear question number
[1:05:37] two when someone speaks in
[1:05:40] tongues and an
[1:05:43] interpretation is given how are we to
[1:05:46] know if the person is truly speaking
[1:05:51] with tongues and how are we to know if a
[1:05:55] true
[1:05:56] interpretation is given now that's a
[1:06:00] good question it's a tricky question not
[1:06:03] the person I'm not saying the person was
[1:06:04] trying to say it tricky now but it was
[1:06:07] it's it's a very good question let's
[1:06:09] read in First Corinthians 12:10 let's
[1:06:11] look a little bit about tongues to
[1:06:13] another the working of Miracles to
[1:06:15] another prophecy to another Discerning
[1:06:17] of spirits to another diverse kinds of
[1:06:22] tongues diverse kind
[1:06:24] kinds of tongues so for some they're
[1:06:28] given the ability by the spirit of God
[1:06:31] to be able to speak in different types
[1:06:35] of languages unlearned languages now and
[1:06:39] there are tongues of men and there are
[1:06:42] tongues of angels some some people would
[1:06:45] be gifted to be able to speak in tongues
[1:06:49] of angels and also tongues of men to
[1:06:53] another the
[1:06:55] interpretation of tongues so notice then
[1:06:58] it's a separate gift in verse 28 God has
[1:07:01] set some in the church first apostles
[1:07:04] second early prophets thirdly teachers
[1:07:06] after that Miracles then Gifts of
[1:07:09] healing not one gift of healing but
[1:07:11] Gifts of healings helps government
[1:07:17] diversities of tongues again verse 30
[1:07:21] have all the gifts of healing do all
[1:07:24] speak with tongues do all interpret and
[1:07:28] of course we know the answers to this
[1:07:29] three-part question is no no no 1
[1:07:34] Corinthians 14:5 I would that you
[1:07:38] all spake with
[1:07:42] tongues now I realize there's a lot of
[1:07:44] message people that don't like this
[1:07:49] verse but I wonder what Spirit it would
[1:07:52] be on us that would not like this verse
[1:07:56] this is just so much the Bible as acts
[1:07:59] 238 right this is your Bible
[1:08:03] right I would that you all spake with
[1:08:07] tongues but notice now but
[1:08:11] rather that ye
[1:08:14] prophesied now why because it's a
[1:08:18] difference in
[1:08:20] edification a person who speaks in tongu
[1:08:24] T and what they're speaking is not to be
[1:08:28] interpreted they are
[1:08:30] edifying themselves so you're alone in
[1:08:33] your closet at home you might even come
[1:08:36] up to the altar here for prayer and you
[1:08:38] might stand there and speak in tongues
[1:08:40] and and you're being edified because
[1:08:42] those of you that's ever done it you
[1:08:44] know it is quite an edification to
[1:08:46] yourself it's just hard to imagine if
[1:08:48] you've never experienced it what what
[1:08:50] what comes with it but prophecy is is
[1:08:53] not edification to the one speaking but
[1:08:57] rather prophecy is an edification to the
[1:09:00] body Now watch how Paul says this
[1:09:04] greater is he that prophesieth than he
[1:09:07] that speaketh with tongues except he
[1:09:11] interpret that the church may receive
[1:09:16] edifying verse six now Brethren if I
[1:09:19] come unto you speaking in tongues what
[1:09:22] shall I profit you
[1:09:24] except I shall speak to you either by
[1:09:26] Revelation or by knowledge or by
[1:09:29] prophesying or by Doctrine now remember
[1:09:33] we're talking about a church service
[1:09:35] here so if a person is at home and
[1:09:38] they're praying they enter into their
[1:09:40] prayer closet I love the way Paul says
[1:09:44] it there also that whenever we're
[1:09:46] praying and we don't know exactly what
[1:09:49] to say that the spirit can make
[1:09:53] intercept for us with Words which cannot
[1:09:57] be said and that word there is
[1:10:01] articulated so it's words that you
[1:10:04] yourself don't know I know people would
[1:10:06] life at us for saying we believe in
[1:10:08] speaking in tongues because in one way
[1:10:11] it doesn't make any sense because you
[1:10:14] are speaking a language that you
[1:10:17] yourself do not know now I hope hope you
[1:10:20] don't think I'm weird and crazy tonight
[1:10:22] but actually the spirit of God is
[1:10:25] anointing you and it is
[1:10:28] bypassing your
[1:10:30] brain it's not running those words
[1:10:33] through your brain because your brain
[1:10:37] does not know those words it has not
[1:10:40] been established in your memory the way
[1:10:44] English has so the spirit of God is
[1:10:47] tapping straight into you and using your
[1:10:51] mouth and you are saying things you
[1:10:53] don't even know what it is you you don't
[1:10:56] know the pronunciation you don't even
[1:10:58] know the meaning you know nothing about
[1:11:01] it and the spirit of God is using you to
[1:11:04] do that you remember the story brother
[1:11:06] random talking about being in the hotel
[1:11:07] room and he said Billy had come to get
[1:11:10] him and his before service and he said
[1:11:13] he was down praying and he heard
[1:11:15] somebody speaking in a foreign language
[1:11:18] and he said he thought man listen at
[1:11:20] that guy and he said he thought it was
[1:11:23] German or something he didn't know
[1:11:24] exactly what it was and it was going so
[1:11:27] fast but it was like it was outside the
[1:11:31] door of the hotel room where he was and
[1:11:34] he said what is that guy
[1:11:36] doing and he said then he realized it
[1:11:39] was him he was the one
[1:11:43] speaking well after it happened and the
[1:11:46] spirit of God he just spoke in tongues
[1:11:48] and spoke in tongues for High V long and
[1:11:51] then Billy come back knocking on the
[1:11:53] door brother R said he jumped up and got
[1:11:55] ready why he said he felt like he could
[1:11:57] leap through a tro and you know jump
[1:11:59] over a wall it's just hard to explain if
[1:12:01] you've never experienced it what it does
[1:12:04] to you come to find out there was a
[1:12:06] woman on the way to the meeting and a 35
[1:12:10] chevet if my memory Serge me rer one
[1:12:12] thinking about remembering this quote
[1:12:15] but she was on the way to the meeting or
[1:12:17] husband maybe and someone else had
[1:12:18] brought her and she was hemorrhaging
[1:12:20] bleeding she started bleeding to death
[1:12:23] in the back city of this car so they
[1:12:25] pulled the car up on the side of the
[1:12:26] road got the woman out on the side of
[1:12:28] the road and she was laying there dying
[1:12:31] and brother BR said what happened was
[1:12:34] the angel of the Lord come into the
[1:12:36] hotel room and begin to ENT seed through
[1:12:41] brother Brandon
[1:12:42] praying but he didn't even know what was
[1:12:45] going
[1:12:46] on so it was the angel of God now wonder
[1:12:50] why that angel didn't do it himself
[1:12:56] they are ministers not so much oh
[1:13:00] Hallelujah
[1:13:03] intercessors but we
[1:13:06] are so this woman needed a
[1:13:09] miracle and the angel of God knew the
[1:13:13] state that woman woman was in and here
[1:13:14] he found a servant down praying and the
[1:13:17] angel of God comes in this hotel room
[1:13:20] and begins to anoint brother brandom and
[1:13:22] he's speaking in language that he never
[1:13:24] learned before and the angel of God was
[1:13:28] interceding through his lips and brother
[1:13:31] Brandon was acting out the part of a
[1:13:33] priest and praying in another language
[1:13:37] and when he went to church that night
[1:13:39] that woman jumped up started testifying
[1:13:41] and said what time was that what time
[1:13:43] did it happen and they timed it it was
[1:13:46] exactly the same time that happened in
[1:13:48] the hotel room so the spirit of God
[1:13:52] started using this now remember them
[1:13:54] tongues was not to be
[1:13:56] interpreted does everybody that speaks
[1:14:00] in tongues mean that it's the Lord of
[1:14:03] course not does it mean that everybody
[1:14:07] that speaks in tongues will speak a
[1:14:10] fluent
[1:14:12] language it does
[1:14:15] not as a matter of fact they may not say
[1:14:18] any more than one word like this seek
[1:14:22] them seek them seek
[1:14:28] them y'all ever heard brother Brandon
[1:14:30] refer to that okay I'll read it to you
[1:14:33] in a
[1:14:34] moment now Paul says now Brethren I come
[1:14:37] to you speaking with the tongues watch
[1:14:38] that I Prophet you except by Revelation
[1:14:41] or doctrine or prophesying notice in
[1:14:44] verse 18 I thank my God I speak with
[1:14:51] tongues more
[1:14:54] more than you all now I wonder how many
[1:14:57] message preachers would make Paul a
[1:15:05] Pentecostal what do we think we're more
[1:15:07] spiritual than
[1:15:08] him notice in verse 19 yet in the church
[1:15:13] I had rather speak five
[1:15:15] words with my understanding that by my
[1:15:18] voice I might teach others than 10,000
[1:15:23] words in an unknown
[1:15:26] tongue wow how could that even equate
[1:15:30] five words with understanding would mean
[1:15:34] more to you as a body than if I stood
[1:15:38] here tonight and the spirit of God moved
[1:15:39] on me and I started speaking in tongues
[1:15:42] and I spoke 10,000 words by the spirit
[1:15:46] of God anointing me to do it and y'all
[1:15:48] would sit there and sat there praise the
[1:15:51] Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord
[1:15:53] wasn't that wonderful wasn't that
[1:15:54] wonderful what' he say I don't have a
[1:15:56] clue any y'all know what he said you
[1:15:58] come to me brother Donnie you know what
[1:16:00] you said I
[1:16:01] don't so we just leave and say wow wow
[1:16:06] wasn't that
[1:16:07] something but you see five words with
[1:16:10] understanding has more value than
[1:16:13] 10,000 even supernaturally spoken in
[1:16:16] tongues you
[1:16:17] understand notice in verse 23 if
[1:16:20] therefore the whole church be come
[1:16:22] together in one place
[1:16:23] and all speak with tongues and there
[1:16:27] come in those that are unlearned or
[1:16:29] unbelievers will they not say you are
[1:16:32] mad which is
[1:16:36] crazy now remember he's not saying it's
[1:16:38] not the spirit of God so say every one
[1:16:42] of us would come in Sunday morning
[1:16:44] everybody in your starts speaking in
[1:16:45] tongues and we have visitors and that
[1:16:47] thing what in the world Brother Louis
[1:16:50] would get up to start leading to sing it
[1:16:52] he couldn't even even lead the singing
[1:16:53] for speaking in tongues brother Harry
[1:16:55] would go to helping him he couldn't even
[1:16:57] sing for speaking in tongues then one of
[1:16:59] your sisters would get up for a special
[1:17:00] and you get up and there you go in
[1:17:02] tongues the next person speaking in
[1:17:04] tongues Brother Lou said brother Donnie
[1:17:07] here he go speaking in tongues and I
[1:17:09] walk out I speak in tongues for an hour
[1:17:12] then we have somebody to close in prayer
[1:17:14] they close in prayer speaking in
[1:17:16] tongues and there's visitors sitting
[1:17:18] here and they're going to say that
[1:17:21] church is absolute
[1:17:23] nuts I've never heard such in my
[1:17:28] life you want to know one reason why
[1:17:30] Pentecost made such a name for themsel
[1:17:33] because of such stuff as that and they
[1:17:36] blamed it on God don't blame Babylon on
[1:17:40] God God is not the author of confusion
[1:17:44] and that's what that
[1:17:45] is now notice watch how Paul
[1:17:48] differentiates between speaking in
[1:17:50] tongues and he said will they not say
[1:17:52] that you're all mad but if all
[1:17:56] prophesy and there come in one that
[1:17:59] believeth not or one unlearned he is
[1:18:01] convinced of all and judged of all now
[1:18:03] wait a minute whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
[1:18:06] so if a person comes in and then you
[1:18:08] stand up and prophesy and you and you
[1:18:10] and you and you and
[1:18:12] you and then people that don't even
[1:18:15] believe in that and they're going to say
[1:18:17] my goodness my goodness God's in that
[1:18:21] place
[1:18:23] just by
[1:18:25] prophesying okay so
[1:18:28] apparently prophecy then is going to say
[1:18:33] something that's going to reveal
[1:18:35] something about that
[1:18:38] individual you see there's a lot of
[1:18:40] things that are said and done that are
[1:18:42] classified as prophecy that are not
[1:18:45] prophecy at all because it reveals
[1:18:50] nothing now listen
[1:18:53] what prophecy will do verse 25 thus are
[1:18:57] the secrets of his heart made manifest
[1:19:02] now speaking in tongues won't do that
[1:19:04] but if brother Jonathan speaks in
[1:19:06] tongues and and brother Paul would stand
[1:19:08] up and and interpret those
[1:19:12] tongues and it would be
[1:19:15] prophecy then it could go back in a
[1:19:17] person's life and say you stole so and
[1:19:20] so you done so and so you to the doctor
[1:19:23] yesterday then the doctor said you've
[1:19:25] got cancer if you don't make that right
[1:19:27] with God you're going to
[1:19:31] die that's true
[1:19:34] tongues and
[1:19:36] interpretation true tongues and
[1:19:39] interpretation does not listen carefully
[1:19:44] stand up and just repeat
[1:19:47] scripture it does
[1:19:50] not say over and over and over again the
[1:19:53] Lord is coming the Lord is
[1:19:56] coming now sit there and question me all
[1:19:58] you want to but I've got them quotes
[1:20:01] land right in front of me I want to give
[1:20:02] them to
[1:20:04] you now watch in verse 27 let any man
[1:20:07] speak in an unknown tongue Let It Be by
[1:20:10] two or at the
[1:20:13] most
[1:20:15] three and that by course and let one
[1:20:19] interpret verse 28 but if there be
[1:20:23] no
[1:20:26] interpreter let him keep silence in the
[1:20:31] church and everybody
[1:20:34] said now remember the spirit of the
[1:20:37] Prophet is subject to the prophet so we
[1:20:40] judge our emotions we would even judge
[1:20:43] if tongues would come upon
[1:20:45] you and you would feel it so strong and
[1:20:49] yet you cannot interpret and there's not
[1:20:52] interpreter in the church you will judge
[1:20:55] that feeling and that anointing that's
[1:20:58] on you and say according to the word of
[1:21:00] God I'm not supposed to interrupt this
[1:21:03] service and I'm not supposed to speak in
[1:21:06] tongues unless there is an interpreter
[1:21:09] but you see what happened in Pentecost
[1:21:11] was that they said well I'm going to
[1:21:13] obey the Lord the anointing is here and
[1:21:15] I'm going to do it I know the word says
[1:21:17] that but I'm going to do it anyway
[1:21:21] a then you see we open the first
[1:21:25] doorway for a demon
[1:21:30] Spirit maybe I'll read it to you before
[1:21:32] we're done with this brother Bram tells
[1:21:34] us in question answers 1961 about all
[1:21:37] tongues not being from God and he says a
[1:21:41] person could be
[1:21:42] baptized into the devil's
[1:21:47] power and speak in tongues and
[1:21:51] prophesy wow
[1:21:54] wow baptized into the devil's
[1:21:59] power now let me read the question again
[1:22:02] when someone speaks in tongues and
[1:22:04] interpretation is given how are we to
[1:22:05] know the person is truly speaking in
[1:22:08] tongues now watch's this God being
[1:22:11] misunderstood he says now someone
[1:22:12] speaking in tongues and another gets up
[1:22:14] to interpret the tongues listen close
[1:22:16] this is being taped and interpretation
[1:22:18] of tongues now I'm going to have to get
[1:22:19] down to some Doctrine in this and the
[1:22:21] interpretation of tongues many people
[1:22:23] interpretate tongues interpret tongues
[1:22:26] rather by an
[1:22:28] extraordinary expression of them
[1:22:32] feeling to
[1:22:34] say such a
[1:22:37] thing that is
[1:22:39] not
[1:22:42] interpretation now I'm a weird message
[1:22:44] preacher okay I'm strange I believe
[1:22:48] brother Brenham not only came to correct
[1:22:50] us on water baptism on Holiness on
[1:22:53] Election predestination I believe he
[1:22:56] come to correct us on
[1:22:59] gifts now I am weird in that sense
[1:23:01] because there's some message brothers
[1:23:04] that don't think brother Brenham had a
[1:23:06] very good understanding on the
[1:23:08] gifts so they revert back to 1906 use of
[1:23:15] the
[1:23:16] gifts but I'm not going to be judged by
[1:23:19] 1906 I'm going to be judged by this word
[1:23:22] right here here that we have now listen
[1:23:25] how he says this so an interpretation of
[1:23:28] tongues many people interpret tongues by
[1:23:30] an extraordinary listen to these words
[1:23:33] now remember this is a a a man with a
[1:23:35] seventh grade education listen to his
[1:23:37] terminology an
[1:23:39] extraordinary expression of them feeling
[1:23:44] feeling to say such a thing that is not
[1:23:49] interpretation now let's let a prophet
[1:23:52] tell us
[1:23:53] what interpretation really
[1:23:55] is interpretation is when they are
[1:23:59] speaking in an unknown
[1:24:02] tongue you are hearing
[1:24:05] them in
[1:24:09] English
[1:24:12] wow so I wonder how many true
[1:24:15] interpreters there really
[1:24:18] are so every person then that claims to
[1:24:22] have the gift of interpretation of
[1:24:24] tongues if they do not hear that
[1:24:27] language in
[1:24:30] English they are not an
[1:24:33] interpreter they are feeling an
[1:24:36] extraordinary something that is not
[1:24:41] interpretation man this is good ain't
[1:24:44] it it
[1:24:47] ain't notice now as I said I I'm one of
[1:24:51] them weird message preachers that I
[1:24:53] believe that we needed the 1906 trash
[1:24:58] that messed up the gifts clean out and
[1:25:01] would have the real gifts I would really
[1:25:05] myself like to see the real gifts cuz to
[1:25:08] be honest with you I'm not sure how many
[1:25:11] real ones I ever have
[1:25:16] seen well praise the Lord y'all ain't
[1:25:20] only just going to be quiet on me I'm
[1:25:22] I'm going to be deep fried after this
[1:25:24] tonight now notice he said I'm your
[1:25:27] father in The Gospel you don't want now
[1:25:31] listen you don't want a wrong
[1:25:35] Spirit you mean the devil would try to
[1:25:38] come in and convince people that they're
[1:25:42] using a gift of the spirit when it's
[1:25:45] actually an evil spirit how we going to
[1:25:47] know brother Donnie we'll judge it by
[1:25:50] the word of the hour
[1:25:55] now why take a substitute when there's a
[1:25:57] whole Pentecostal Skies full of the real
[1:25:59] why eat in a garbage can when there's a
[1:26:04] fine big clean table set there with
[1:26:07] chicken and dumplings now I want you to
[1:26:09] notice he's comparing a false gift
[1:26:13] eating out of a garbage can to a true
[1:26:17] gift eating chicken and dumpings now if
[1:26:21] you don't like chicken and dump dpls of
[1:26:22] course this quote don't mean nothing to
[1:26:24] you but for those of us people who like
[1:26:26] chicken and dumplings man we're smacking
[1:26:28] our lips so why would we want a wrong
[1:26:32] Spirit but people get in their mind oh
[1:26:35] if we teach that if we teach that it'll
[1:26:37] bind the spirit if teaching this word of
[1:26:40] God will bind the spirit I'll tell you
[1:26:43] one thing it's the wrong Spirit if we do
[1:26:46] what he taught my goodness why in the
[1:26:47] world would we study hundreds and
[1:26:49] hundreds of quotes to prove we need the
[1:26:51] gift
[1:26:52] and preach hundreds and hundreds of
[1:26:54] quotes to prove we got a right to a
[1:26:56] Pentecostal experience and then not go
[1:26:59] right back to the same message and prove
[1:27:02] how we're supposed to use them it don't
[1:27:04] make a lick of sense to
[1:27:07] me can I go on a few more
[1:27:10] minutes now watch here's an interpreter
[1:27:13] now I can stand up now watch this
[1:27:15] example absolutely beautiful example I
[1:27:18] only know two or three words in a
[1:27:20] different language that I know
[1:27:22] now I'm going to say this one literal
[1:27:25] not spiritual now what what he's going
[1:27:27] to do he's going to say some words in
[1:27:30] another language this is not him
[1:27:31] speaking in tongues but he's going to
[1:27:33] say some words in
[1:27:36] Africans I'm going to say be
[1:27:40] be AK will
[1:27:43] Africans
[1:27:46] spren now I doubt whether there's a
[1:27:48] person here that knows what I said yeah
[1:27:51] brother what I say so there happened to
[1:27:54] be a brother that was there in the
[1:27:57] meeting Africans Bea Bea blah I am very
[1:28:02] very happy I'm here to speak Africans
[1:28:06] Africans speaking I am here to speak
[1:28:11] Africans when I read this I thought it
[1:28:13] was absolutely awesome that God worked
[1:28:15] it out with there was a man there that
[1:28:16] could be able to speak a foreign
[1:28:17] language so here is an example of an
[1:28:21] interpret
[1:28:23] so if someone jumps up and speaks in
[1:28:25] tongues and they say three or four words
[1:28:27] in tongues and then someone jumps up and
[1:28:30] they're supposedly interpreting those
[1:28:32] tongues and their interpretation has
[1:28:35] about 50 or 75
[1:28:37] words and that person spoke in tongues
[1:28:40] and said
[1:28:41] five now I realize some languages are
[1:28:44] different I don't I don't know Spanish
[1:28:46] there's just a few words I know in
[1:28:47] Spanish Taco Chim changa you know
[1:28:50] burrito oh y'all know them
[1:28:52] too but from what I'm told Spanish can
[1:28:56] be a much more descriptive language than
[1:28:59] English having preached brother George
[1:29:01] Smith and brother Danny Su uh you know I
[1:29:04] I've heard them and I would say say
[1:29:05] three or four words and they might say
[1:29:07] five or six because the Spanish language
[1:29:10] is a little bit more descriptive and it
[1:29:12] would take a few more words to say the
[1:29:14] same thing as we would in English but
[1:29:17] whenever you see someone then that is
[1:29:18] speaking eight or 10 words and then The
[1:29:21] Interpreter stands up and goes on and on
[1:29:24] and on and on something is wrong
[1:29:29] somewhere let me tell you where that
[1:29:31] come from carryover from
[1:29:34] 1906 now I realize some of the brothers
[1:29:37] in the message think and they say it
[1:29:40] this way well poor brother Donnie you
[1:29:43] know he come from Pentecost and it's
[1:29:45] really scarred him and and that that's
[1:29:48] why he's scared of this no that's
[1:29:51] absolutely absolutely wrong and I think
[1:29:53] sometimes some of these preachers forget
[1:29:56] that God also talks to me as a matter of
[1:30:00] fact I heard two of my friends not long
[1:30:02] ago in another realm and I heard them
[1:30:06] sitting talking about me and I heard the
[1:30:09] words they
[1:30:14] said ah and the words I just told you
[1:30:18] was some of what they said I heard them
[1:30:22] so you see it's not because I come from
[1:30:24] Pentecost I'm not basing this on
[1:30:26] Pentecost I'm basing this on the
[1:30:28] teaching of the message of the hour that
[1:30:31] we say we
[1:30:32] follow and I don't just say we say it I
[1:30:35] say we believe it it's not to take from
[1:30:38] us it's to keep us from evil
[1:30:42] spirits oh my now notice he said now
[1:30:46] what did he do I was speaking in
[1:30:47] Africans he heard me in English is that
[1:30:50] right cuz you know a cons if you're
[1:30:52] speaking in an unknown tongue and
[1:30:53] interpreting you're hearing in the
[1:30:56] language that you were born in because
[1:30:59] that's a only way you can interpret what
[1:31:01] they're saying because the Holy Spirit
[1:31:03] has interpreted it to you you're just
[1:31:06] speaking for the Holy Spirit what an
[1:31:09] awesome thing what an awesome thing
[1:31:12] wouldn't it be awesome to have these
[1:31:14] things in reality among us the real ones
[1:31:17] that the Holy Ghost this ain't just for
[1:31:19] preachers that the spirit of God could
[1:31:22] take a man or woman a boy or girl that'd
[1:31:24] be so submitted to God the Holy Ghost
[1:31:26] would take their mouths and speak a
[1:31:29] language out of them that they never
[1:31:32] heard and the same spirit of God could
[1:31:34] move on another young person and they
[1:31:36] would stand up and give exactly the
[1:31:38] interpretation how am I going to know if
[1:31:40] it's the Lord or not brother Donnie how
[1:31:41] should I know if I'm an interpreter or
[1:31:43] not you'll judge by
[1:31:46] this so if someone speaks in another
[1:31:48] language and they're talking in Aramaic
[1:31:51] they're talking in Hebrew but you hear
[1:31:53] it in English just as plain as what I'm
[1:31:57] speaking to you tonight then you know
[1:32:01] you've got a gift of
[1:32:04] interpretation praise the
[1:32:06] Lord like a precious old brother gone on
[1:32:09] he's in glory tonight and I I really
[1:32:11] believe that dearest old soul that I
[1:32:13] know brother Ryan all of us know him and
[1:32:15] he used to stand on the street God
[1:32:17] forgive me not to be sacri religious I
[1:32:19] know it's a blaspheming the Holy Ghost
[1:32:20] is unpardonable but brother Ryan used to
[1:32:23] say one word over and over all the time
[1:32:26] something about seek them and seek them
[1:32:29] and seek them or something like that
[1:32:32] while somebody said do you think that's
[1:32:33] of God I said certainly it's of God
[1:32:38] certainly I believe it's of God he was
[1:32:40] speaking in tongues but I couldn't say
[1:32:42] what he's saying cuz I don't know but
[1:32:44] the presence of the spirit was there so
[1:32:48] if the presence of the spirit is there
[1:32:50] and this person saying one word over and
[1:32:52] over again and this one jumps up and
[1:32:56] tries to give an interpretation yet
[1:32:58] don't know what he's saying if this man
[1:33:00] is not giving the interpretation he's
[1:33:02] prophesying but the spirit prophesying
[1:33:05] upon him he's not giving an
[1:33:07] interpretation notice again it's the
[1:33:09] spirit of God giving a message to the
[1:33:12] church interpretation it's got to be
[1:33:15] understood in English and repeat back
[1:33:19] exactly what the person said that that's
[1:33:22] the gift of interpretation it's not
[1:33:25] someone standing up well I feel led that
[1:33:28] the interpretation is this this this
[1:33:31] this and this but did you hear it in
[1:33:37] English praise the
[1:33:39] Lord adoption now I want you to notice
[1:33:43] God's thinking is so phenomenal if you
[1:33:46] speak with tongues and it's just some
[1:33:48] repeating of scripture God said don't
[1:33:51] you use vain
[1:33:53] repetition it's a message directly
[1:33:57] to
[1:34:01] somebody now a preacher is called to
[1:34:04] preach and if I get up here and preach
[1:34:06] and all the rest of the ministers you're
[1:34:07] in our church and every service I would
[1:34:09] tell you Jesus is coming soon Jesus is
[1:34:12] coming soon I'm called of God to do that
[1:34:16] but God is not going to use tongues and
[1:34:20] interpretation to do
[1:34:23] that not according to the
[1:34:27] message now what we have to do then is
[1:34:30] Judge What We Believe by the message of
[1:34:33] the hour that we say we
[1:34:36] believe and let the gifts pass through
[1:34:39] not
[1:34:40] 1906 but let them pass from the book of
[1:34:43] Acts right down through the message of
[1:34:45] the hour and anybody here tonight or
[1:34:47] anybody to hear this and I know there's
[1:34:49] going to be preachers that's going to
[1:34:50] listen to it so any of your preachers
[1:34:53] you show me in the book of Acts where
[1:34:56] they stood up and tongues and
[1:34:57] interpretation of tongues and said the
[1:35:00] Lord is coming the Rapture is at hand or
[1:35:02] something like that or repeating
[1:35:04] scripture and I'll apologize next
[1:35:07] question
[1:35:10] answers of course you can't do that can
[1:35:14] you now watch how he goes on with this
[1:35:17] in the adoption So speaking in tongues
[1:35:20] and interpretting
[1:35:22] watch how he brings it actually to be
[1:35:25] discernment in the body God don't use
[1:35:28] vain repetition but it'll be a message
[1:35:31] directly to somebody ask me one time put
[1:35:35] your finger one time that the Holy
[1:35:38] Spirit ever under discernment told
[1:35:42] somebody repeated a scripture over and
[1:35:46] over it told him something that was
[1:35:49] wrong and then something that they had
[1:35:51] had done something they must do
[1:35:54] something had to happen or something
[1:35:56] like that so now listen is speaking in
[1:36:03] tongues and
[1:36:06] interpretation now you see God knew that
[1:36:09] there would be Major Prophets that would
[1:36:11] come on the earth and they would only be
[1:36:13] here for so long and he would take them
[1:36:16] off the Earth but God wanted to have
[1:36:18] gifts in the church even when that
[1:36:21] Prophet was gone to where those gifts
[1:36:25] would be able to do that very same
[1:36:28] work so in any of you tape listening if
[1:36:31] you ever found brother brandham call
[1:36:33] somebody out and just quote scripture
[1:36:35] quote scripture quote scripture quote
[1:36:37] scripture now he actually Likens tongues
[1:36:40] and
[1:36:42] interpretation to the very same
[1:36:44] discernment that God is having him to do
[1:36:47] this is your message I've got these if
[1:36:49] you'd like to read them
[1:36:52] he says So speaking in tongues and
[1:36:55] interpretation if there's one in the
[1:36:56] church that speaks with tongues let
[1:36:58] another interpret let's say this if
[1:37:00] brother Neville would raise up and speak
[1:37:02] in tongues and this brother here give an
[1:37:04] interpretation tell this man here now
[1:37:06] watch's the examples of the
[1:37:10] messenger tell this man here that
[1:37:12] yesterday he went out and done something
[1:37:14] wrong now the doctor told him today he
[1:37:17] had cancer go make that right come back
[1:37:20] here and get right with God the man say
[1:37:22] truly that's the truth God is with
[1:37:25] you so you mean to tell me that tongues
[1:37:28] and
[1:37:30] interpretation would be something like
[1:37:32] this that brother Jonathan might speak
[1:37:33] in tongues brother Rob might interpret
[1:37:36] and the spirit of God would turn around
[1:37:38] by The Interpreter and point his finger
[1:37:40] at you and say you lied
[1:37:42] yesterday you done this and you done
[1:37:45] that and the spirit of God fell on your
[1:37:47] heart and you say Lord God Lord God I'm
[1:37:50] sorry
[1:37:52] I'm sorry
[1:37:54] Lord why that's what the prophet
[1:37:57] done and this is the way he applied
[1:38:01] tongues and interpretation why would we
[1:38:04] want to settle for a substitute out of a
[1:38:07] garbage can that tells nothing in the
[1:38:10] future does not unveil sins in people's
[1:38:14] lives but repeat
[1:38:18] scripture I heard it all my life in
[1:38:20] Pentecost
[1:38:22] nothing ever future nothing ever direct
[1:38:26] yeah the Lord love you well I reckon any
[1:38:29] of us could stand up and say that
[1:38:30] couldn't we I the Lord say I'm coming
[1:38:33] you know it's dark out there well it
[1:38:35] sure is ain't it you're in a great hour
[1:38:38] we are ain't we you don't say
[1:38:43] nothing brother brand said they told him
[1:38:45] actually set the church in order said
[1:38:47] brother brandham you put us on the spot
[1:38:50] by saying that he said you think I ain't
[1:38:52] on the spot in front of thousands of
[1:38:55] people tell them their name their
[1:38:58] address what house they live in three
[1:39:00] steps going up to your house 3905 Brown
[1:39:04] Street you went to a doctor heavy set
[1:39:06] wore glasses balding in the top of his
[1:39:09] head he told you day before yesterday
[1:39:11] you had so and so and
[1:39:13] so but he said if it's God it'll never
[1:39:18] fail praise the Lord but you see we want
[1:39:21] to operate our gifts in the comfortable
[1:39:25] Zone
[1:39:27] oh oh the Lord shows me there's somebody
[1:39:32] here tonight that's got a
[1:39:35] pain now I can't pick it up yet if it's
[1:39:38] but it's somewhere from the top of your
[1:39:40] head to the so of your feet maybe if I
[1:39:43] get closer to you I'll be able to figure
[1:39:45] it out oh wait a minute wait a minute no
[1:39:47] wait a minute no no it's somebody
[1:39:49] streaming that's what it is it and
[1:39:53] actually and we call that a
[1:39:56] gift that's a
[1:39:58] clown brother Donnie you shouldn't say
[1:40:01] that oh yes I should I am not afraid to
[1:40:06] identify something like that as an
[1:40:11] impostor I watched the Pentecostal
[1:40:13] preacher that I worked with and a
[1:40:16] television crew come to film
[1:40:19] us
[1:40:23] and I watched them speak to him and tell
[1:40:26] him you need to start calling people
[1:40:29] out and you need to tell people
[1:40:32] things and you don't have to get very
[1:40:35] very close just tell them things in
[1:40:37] general it'll help your
[1:40:40] crowd and it'll help your
[1:40:44] offering I watched that man as he
[1:40:47] started manipulating that and I watched
[1:40:51] as it increased an intensity where he
[1:40:56] went because people heard about it and
[1:40:59] their expectation got higher and higher
[1:41:03] and
[1:41:05] higher I'll tell you Friends when the
[1:41:08] gospel comes to that spot I'll step down
[1:41:11] I'll quit preaching when it comes to
[1:41:13] where that we have to make the gospel a
[1:41:17] show that's not what I'm here for you
[1:41:19] I'm here for the real reality of God
[1:41:23] we've got a table full of chicken and
[1:41:25] dumplings and all the rest of the good
[1:41:27] things of God why would we settle for
[1:41:30] something
[1:41:32] less can I have few more minutes I know
[1:41:34] I'm going a little bit over and church
[1:41:36] order he says whatever brother conin
[1:41:37] speaks brother Hickerson gives up and
[1:41:40] gives an exam gives an interpretation
[1:41:42] now here we have the prophet giving us
[1:41:44] examples an example let brother soand so
[1:41:47] write this down now we all know the Lord
[1:41:50] is coming were aware of that and brother
[1:41:52] Neville got up and preached each night
[1:41:55] got up each night and said behold the
[1:41:57] Lord is coming behold the Lord is coming
[1:42:00] that would be all right but he's the
[1:42:01] pastor at the platform he's got the word
[1:42:03] for that tongues interpretation of
[1:42:07] tongues which is prophecy or a prophet
[1:42:09] speaking that's something not written in
[1:42:13] the
[1:42:16] word
[1:42:18] wow what's written in the word word he's
[1:42:21] to bring it but what's not written in
[1:42:24] the word is what you're to tell him for
[1:42:28] instance tell brother wheeler thus
[1:42:31] sayith the Lord tomorrow in the sand pit
[1:42:33] not to go down to it because there'll be
[1:42:36] a truck turn over it'll be something
[1:42:38] like that it's got to be done and you
[1:42:41] spoke it he interpreted then lay it on
[1:42:44] the platform after your ministry is
[1:42:47] finished now listen why I wanted this to
[1:42:49] be this way and this day when there's
[1:42:51] been so much confusion about it and it
[1:42:55] causes a stumbling block let one
[1:42:59] speaking in tongues another interpre and
[1:43:01] give the message and let it be read
[1:43:03] right off at the platform of what's
[1:43:05] going to take place and let it happen
[1:43:07] you see what happens tell them tomorrow
[1:43:10] at a certain time or next week at a
[1:43:13] certain time there's going to be a
[1:43:14] certain thing let the unbeliever sit
[1:43:16] there and listen to that and see it
[1:43:19] before it happen foretold by the spirit
[1:43:22] of God it's going to happen they'll know
[1:43:25] what kind of spirit it is among you can
[1:43:29] I read one
[1:43:32] more got a few
[1:43:34] nods now I believe in speaking in tongu
[1:43:37] I believe in
[1:43:38] interpretation but
[1:43:42] it now do we believe these musts are
[1:43:46] actually
[1:43:49] musts y'all believe the ter must I do
[1:43:55] too Lord help us it must be something
[1:43:59] directly to the church not not the Lord
[1:44:05] is coming soon or something which is all
[1:44:07] right don't use
[1:44:09] vain repution so you see when people are
[1:44:12] doing that they're breaking the
[1:44:15] scripture by doing it they're doing
[1:44:17] exactly what Jesus said don't do that's
[1:44:20] not what tongues and interpretation is
[1:44:23] that's what I'm supposed to do that's
[1:44:25] what these ministers are supposed to do
[1:44:27] the Lord's coming the Lord's coming
[1:44:28] Everybody Get Ready Get Ready Get ready
[1:44:31] and then God is going to speak in
[1:44:33] tongues and give interpretation and the
[1:44:35] form of Prophecy and going to stand up
[1:44:37] and tell you the same thing that I just
[1:44:39] got done telling
[1:44:45] you either one of two things friends
[1:44:48] we're going to have to acknowledge
[1:44:51] that we do not believe the prophet's
[1:44:53] teaching on the
[1:44:54] gifts or we're going to have to
[1:44:57] acknowledge we have been
[1:45:01] wrong it ain't never been too hard for
[1:45:03] me to admit I've been wrong since I've
[1:45:05] been wrong most of my life I've run into
[1:45:08] a lot of Christians that can't say
[1:45:09] they're
[1:45:10] sorry I've probably said that as much as
[1:45:13] I've said Jesus or A lot of other things
[1:45:15] is common terms to me because I've been
[1:45:16] so sorry and so wrong and I figure I'll
[1:45:20] continue to say it probably 5 minutes
[1:45:22] before I'm changed I'm so sorry but I'm
[1:45:26] so glad I can say I'm sorry aren't you
[1:45:32] aren't you glad you can say I have been
[1:45:36] wrong so let's bring it back to the
[1:45:39] first question the spirit of
[1:45:42] truth will acknowledge these quotes and
[1:45:46] believe me this is only a small
[1:45:49] handful I I woke up day before yesterday
[1:45:51] about
[1:45:52] 4:00 I laid there for 10 15 minutes
[1:45:55] something like that I knew I wasn't
[1:45:56] going to be able to go back to sleep so
[1:45:57] I eased up real easy got out of the bed
[1:46:00] went and got dressed and everything went
[1:46:02] out got my laptop starting to answer
[1:46:04] some of these questions and I sat there
[1:46:06] in in in the room by myself and I felt
[1:46:09] the presence of the Lord come near and
[1:46:11] my heart was so
[1:46:13] heavy thinking about this night and
[1:46:17] thinking that there have been an element
[1:46:19] of people that'll get mad at
[1:46:22] me and some that'll cut me off and some
[1:46:25] say brother Donnie don't believe in the
[1:46:26] move of God well let me tell you
[1:46:28] something that is a lie I do believe in
[1:46:31] the move of God but it is the move of
[1:46:33] God I
[1:46:34] want I don't want my people fed out of a
[1:46:38] garbage can whether I'm preaching or
[1:46:40] somebody else is preaching to you I want
[1:46:43] you fed chicken and dumplings ham meat
[1:46:47] steak Big Mac whatever it is you like
[1:46:49] you know whatever it is you need I don't
[1:46:51] want you having to go down the garbage
[1:46:53] can of Pentecost and merging it with
[1:46:57] acts two and try to push that down my
[1:46:59] throat and say this is the bride's
[1:47:02] Revival no it
[1:47:04] ain't because it don't line up as what
[1:47:06] the prophet taught
[1:47:08] us I want a bride's
[1:47:11] Revival don't you I want a bride's
[1:47:15] Revival but a bride's Revival is not
[1:47:17] going to lead me back to what I came out
[1:47:21] of I left that because it made me sick
[1:47:24] to my stomach why would I want to go
[1:47:27] back to it but you realize some of the
[1:47:29] message preachers were not in
[1:47:32] Pentecost and let me be honest with you
[1:47:34] from my heart and all close I used to
[1:47:36] despise my years of being in Pentecost I
[1:47:39] used to hate it and I thought God why
[1:47:42] did you leave me in that mess I wasted
[1:47:45] years of my
[1:47:48] life but as I've went on I begin to
[1:47:51] realize he had a reason for letting me
[1:47:53] come through there so I'd be able to
[1:47:56] recognize and see whenever some of the
[1:47:59] same Pentecostal stuff would start
[1:48:02] coming right inside of our
[1:48:04] message and some of the brothers have
[1:48:06] not been there so they don't recognize
[1:48:09] it that I'd be able to look by the grace
[1:48:11] of God and say no no no
[1:48:15] no that that's what that's what we had
[1:48:17] back there and what did it lead to
[1:48:20] carnal impersonation false prophecies
[1:48:23] why did Brother Ram even have to say in
[1:48:25] order to his own church because he said
[1:48:26] they was saying things that never come
[1:48:28] to
[1:48:30] pass and then what will it produce this
[1:48:33] one speaks in tongues and it will it
[1:48:36] will compel people to stand and give a
[1:48:40] prophecy or an interpretation even if
[1:48:43] it's wrong because if not that person
[1:48:46] will have to be corrected and say look
[1:48:48] brother sister don't speak speak in
[1:48:50] tongues again unless there's an
[1:48:52] interpreter well that really makes folks
[1:48:54] mad when you do that believe me I've had
[1:48:56] to do it before so what will we do we
[1:48:59] will be compelled to
[1:49:03] perform God help us no
[1:49:08] no brother Donnie would would you want
[1:49:11] would you welcome the gifts in our
[1:49:12] church it's all of my
[1:49:15] heart but I'm want the real
[1:49:18] ones what I we welcome tongues
[1:49:21] interpretation would I welcome yes I
[1:49:24] would I would God's Prophet said ananas
[1:49:29] and Safara will return to the church
[1:49:33] remember Peter was not a prophet and
[1:49:35] when they walked before him God revealed
[1:49:37] to him by the Holy Ghost what they had
[1:49:39] done and they dropped dead you talking
[1:49:43] about getting people right with God if
[1:49:45] we had that in our own assembly and
[1:49:47] people come in they say whoa whoa be
[1:49:49] careful now be be careful I ain't
[1:49:51] talking about hitting and missing I
[1:49:53] ain't talking about saying things in
[1:49:55] generalities when even if you miss
[1:49:57] people can't tell it I'm talking about
[1:49:59] being so precise tell brother wheeler
[1:50:01] not to go to the sand pit that's the
[1:50:04] kind of God I serve L's
[1:50:10] stand well after tonight y'all may not
[1:50:12] want no more question answers
[1:50:15] huh God bless you young people I love
[1:50:18] you so
[1:50:19] much if the Lord terries there's no way
[1:50:21] for us to know how long will this go on
[1:50:24] will there be another generation I I
[1:50:26] don't see how there could be but if
[1:50:28] there was some of you Brothers will be
[1:50:31] the deacons some of you Brothers will be
[1:50:33] the preachers the pastors you will be
[1:50:36] the ones that'll be standing up here and
[1:50:38] I'll be sitting on the front row maybe
[1:50:40] like brother Benton an old
[1:50:43] man we don't want to turn our church
[1:50:45] over and the carrying on of the
[1:50:48] message to a group of people say ah we
[1:50:51] don't need that no more a that's
[1:50:53] oldfashioned we want it to carry on
[1:50:56] don't we to the coming of the Lord
[1:51:00] Jesus how many like to be remembered
[1:51:02] tonight as we
[1:51:05] pray heavenly

[1:51:24] each of us father that we would be able
[1:51:27] to listen with an open heart and as I

[1:51:35] six weeks

[1:51:40] and they're tremendous questions and I'm
[1:51:43] studying on them the inspiration the
[1:51:45] spirit of God oh Lord just made them so
[1:51:48] real and I I thank you thank you for it

[1:52:08] spirit of Truth so how can we tell if we
[1:52:11] got the Holy Ghost because the spirit in

[1:53:02] genuine I don't want it to be as I've
[1:53:05] seen before and even seen it some of the
[1:53:07] message where it hits and misses and
[1:53:09] hits and misses I don't want a hit and a
[1:53:13] miss we want the genuine you don't hit
[1:53:16] and miss Lord you hit every time

[1:53:49] things by by the word as a matter of
[1:53:51] fact your Prophet tells us them Ephesian
[1:53:54] Christians they judge them
[1:53:57] Apostles and they went stood right in
[1:54:00] their face and told them and called them
[1:54:05] Liars The Prophet said wow that is so
[1:54:08] bold how could they do that they told
[1:54:11] them to their face you are
[1:54:14] liars because you're not saying what the
[1:54:17] prophet said help us to
[1:54:20] realize the spirit of God will always
[1:54:23] agree with the word and the spirit of

[1:58:03] Holy
[1:58:04] Ghost and I'll never forget his
