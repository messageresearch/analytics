We want to say that we welcome them to this service. Could we give all those folks a good hand tonight if you will. Praise the Lord. We want to look at her our prayer requests tonight. Sister Judy Davis asking for prayer. Abdominal abdominal pain uh very severe. She's just asking that we would remember her as we pray tonight. Brother Kirk Sacker says to please pray for a neighbor of ours who is suffering from head to toe with severe pain. Area physicians cannot find the cause. They sent him to Vanderbilt for further tests last Friday. He is waiting for the results from those tests. So they're asking that we would remember that prayer request tonight. Then we have a testimony from Sister Wanda Bman. Says, "In April of this year, I had gone to the eye doctor to get new glasses. During the visit, I was told that I had cataracts. The doctor said to come back in one year and discuss surgery to remove them. In August, my vision changed again and the eye doctor referred me to a eye clinic for cataract surgery. This past Wednesday night, I went up for prayer to ask the Lord to remove the cataracts. On Thursday morning, I woke up and the cataracts were gone. All praise and honor to the Lord Jesus for his grace and mercy. Amen. Praise the Lord. You had a good testimony tonight. Amen. Urgent prayer requests for Sister Mary Beth Holloway. The Lord knows all about that need. We just committed unto the Lord. Sister Janet Paynees asking that we would uh pray for two of her grandsons who lost their coworker to suicide and the family uh has really been hit hard and pray for all that's concerned in that. So, we want to remember that prayer request tonight that the Lord would be mindful. Brother Greg Robbins is going to have surgery to remove his eye on Friday. He's been in a lot of pain due to his eye. Please pray that everything goes well. Please remember Sister Shirley in prayer as well. So, we certainly want to pray for those folks tonight. Brother Smith and Sister Diana Ward are not feeling well, unable to be in service. I want to pray for them tonight. Brother Tyler and Sister Caitlyn Gagnan uh sent in a prayer request. She's having some difficulty with her pregnancy and they're just asking without going into a lot of detail, they're just asking that God would be mindful and let everything work out to her good. So, we just commit all that unto the Lord tonight. He's more than able to meet every need among us. Do you believe that tonight with all your heart? And then brother Bisc will be on this coming Sunday. I don't know exact the hour or the time or anything like that, but I I do know that it will be Sunday. So, we certainly want to pray for that family, that church family, that the Lord would just be mindful of all of those folks. And uh, Brother Bisco was a was a great hero of the faith. I believe that with all of my heart. So, we want to just remember all those folks in prayer. Uh, brother Michael says, "If you want to help with the fall festival, signup sheets are in the library." So, remember that. And personal and business changes to the directory will be accepted in the library until Wednesday, October the 15th. So remember that all those announcements tonight. You have an unspoken prayer request tonight you'd like for this group to pray about. Could we stand to our feet? Let's sing that again. The course of that. I'm amazed that you love me. Are you amazed his love for you tonight? Somebody say it's the truth. Anyway, give him one more good hand clap of praise tonight if you love me with all your heart. I'm amazed that you love me.

Appreciate Brother Fred Perry, don't we? &gt;&gt; Good brother. Amen. Dave. Amen. Appreciate you. &gt;&gt; It's so wonderful to be in the house of the Lord. No greater place to be than right here at this time. We could have been anywhere, but the Lord chose us and destinated us to be right here. So let's bow our heads and go to him in prayer. Our gracious heavenly father, we once again we've been given the opportunity to come and sit in the house of God. Oh, it thrills my heart, Lord, to just to be able to say that I could come and sit in the house of God in this day and the hour that we live when such things going on around the world. We can say that we have a king that knelt before a cross in humility, but the father lifted him up in honor. And Lord, we want to do that tonight. We want to lift our hearts to you. Oh, that you could cleanse us, Lord, and help us, Lord, in these times that we have, Lord, our sicknesses and and pains and uh just the way human life is, Lord. But we know we are inheritors of miracles. We've heard one tonight, Lord. And we are inheritors of faith. We are the inheritors of all things only because you went down in humility and raised in honor. And we give you the glory and the power, Lord. We give you our lives, Lord. All things belong to you. And we're not here to fight for anything else. But what we want to fight for, Lord, is our surrender. That we could surrender our hearts and surrender our lives totally for you, Lord. Now, bless the service tonight, Lord. Bless the man of God as he comes. Let wisdom flow from his lips, Lord, that feeds our hearts, Lord, and gives us that uplifting power, Lord, that we need. fill us tonight, Lord. Whatever need we have, Lord, we know that we could come before you and you would answer those things, Lord. We have faith in you, Lord. Now, bless us, Lord, and help us, Lord, as we honor you tonight, Lord, with singing and praise. And let our lips be full of worship and the fruits of our lips be honored before you, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Ushers, if you want to come tonight, receive the evening offering, you give us unto the Lord. Once again, if you're a vist, God bless you. Now, what if you knew that tonight was your last night that you ever get to be in church and you'd ever get this opportunity to worship? &gt;&gt; Would you make it a good one? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, how do you know it ain't? &gt;&gt; Let's sing with everything we got tonight. We want to worship the Lord in spirit and in truth, right? Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." Give him one more good hand clap of praise tonight. Let's sing. After all this life is over. After all this life is over and our burdens have been lifted. And I stand upon the mountain top topped so tall looking over in that city that the Savior is preparing.

You can be seated tonight. Give our singers a nice hand. Sister Adessa, if you want to sing, then the old people will sing. And then brother Caos, you want to sing? [Music] There is a blood that cost a life that paid my way. And death it price. And when it fell down from the cross, my sins were gone. My sins for God. There is a grave that tried to hide this precious blood that gave me life. And in three days he breathed again and rose to stand. in my defense. And so I come to tell you he's alive to tell you that he drives every tear that falls. And so I come to tell you that he saves, to shout and to proclaim that he's coming back for you. [Music] There is a blood. His side is the blind. [Music] It heals the sick, the lonely fight. [Music] It has the power to free the bound has chains a fall [Music] upon the ground. Oh, pour it out to cleanse my soul and let it liquid. Gloryy flow [Music] because he lives to make me whole high. owe my life. [Music] I owe my all. And so I come to tell you he's alive to tell you that he tries every tear that falls. And so I come to tell you that he saves to shout and to provail that he's coming back for you. Oh, what can wash away my sins? Nothing. Oh nothing. And what can make me whole again? Nothing but the blood. Nothing but the blood. So I come to tell you he's alive. to tell you that he tries every tear that falls. And so I come to tell you that he saves to shout and to proclaim that he's coming back for you. [Music] Mary is a blood [Music] that cost a life that paid my way. Death price. [Music] [Applause] Here's another song that uh Sister Betty wrote a long time ago. It seemed like the only people that request us to sing is other old people. I just don't get that. But that's the way it is. As long as you old people want to hear us sing, I guess we'll try to sing for you. Hope this song will bless you. It says, "I'll soon be gone." Amen. [Music] When the darkness of this life is filled with sadness and our hearts are often troubled deep within. I stop and think of how our God looked down upon us. And by faith, he's lifted up where I can see. I'll soon be &gt;&gt; I'll soon be gone. It won't be long till I fly till I home in the sky. There'll be no fears. He'll dry my tears. One of these days with faith so strong, I'll soon be. [Music] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I know the light of his presence is now with us. I have seen the amber light so bright and strong. It's brightest ray out shines the light of morning sunshine. I know is God assuring me I'll soon be gone. &gt;&gt; I'll soon I'll soon be gone. It won't be long till I fly to my home in the sky. There will be no fear. He'll dry my tears. One of these days with faith so strong, I'll soon be gone. One of these days with faith so strong I'll soon be gone. [Applause] I love to hear them sing. &gt;&gt; It's awesome to, you know, I grew up in Kentucky, a little bitty single wide trailer church, and I heard all these songs. Sister Geraldine, Sister Jackie, or Sister Betty. And you know, you you you hear the songs, but when you get to meet the person, you really see the life that made that song. It's just it's it's incredible. I love it. I pray this is a blessing. [Music] It's easy to bless you when the valleyies behind me. It's easy to trust you when my world is not unwinding. But this is the darkest midnight that I have ever seen. So I will stand my ground, lift my hands to you and sing. Before the prayer is answered. Before the battle's won. Before this trial is over. Before the healing comes. I will choose to trust you. I will bless you, Lord. I won't wait to praise you after. I will praise you before in the lonely days of silence. [Music] When the waiting gets old, [Music] I've found a flame of worship. [Music] Keeps my heart from growing cold. You've always been so faithful when I can't do my part. Even in my worn out weakness, nothing changes who you are. Before the prayer is answered, before the battle's won, before this trial is over, before the healing comes, I will choose to trust you. I will bless you, Lord. Lord, I won't wait to praise you after. I will praise you before you ever for me. You knew I'd be here on my knees. You're the one who's fighting for me. And you know where this will lead. Before the prayer is answered, before the battle's won, before this trial is over, before the healing comes, I will choose to trust you. I will bless you Lord. I will praise you after. I will praise you before. [Music] No, I won't wait to praise you after. I will praise you before. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of praise we want to have, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Not just wait till the prayer is even answered, but give him praise before it ever gets answered. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's read tonight Genesis 24 verse 58. Trust everybody's doing well. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Fighting the devil. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Winning. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not near as many of you winning. Are you winning? &gt;&gt; All right. Praise the Lord. That's what we want to hear. Let's read together. And they called Rebecca and said unto her, "Will thou go with this man?" And she said, "I will go." And they sent away Rebecca, their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men. Won't you notice the order? Who came first? [Music] &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Rebecca. Ah. And they sent away Rebecca, their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men. So you see the going away is not brother Brandham going to have a private resurrection and then brother Brandham's going to raise all the dead and we're going to have a tent meeting &gt;&gt; and people's going to get the Holy Ghost and &gt;&gt; that's contrary to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who is the final voice of the final age? &gt;&gt; The bride is. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that what he said? &gt;&gt; That's what he said. And they blessed Rebecca and said unto her, "Thou art our sister. Be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them." And Rebecca arose and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man. And the servant took Rebecca, and went his way. I want to speak to you tonight on the bride's dowy. How many like to be remembered as we go before the Lord? Aren't you glad that our God, if there would be millions of people praying at this very instant, some need healing, some need financial blessing, some need a job, some need this, this, this. He could hear all of them at one time. and be sure and get your name on your package and then your neighbor wouldn't have to bring you a package because they delivered your package at their door and you got their package. But our God is so mighty and so wonderful that he can hear all of that at once and send each answer right directly on time to the right individual. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Let's pray together. Father, we so so love you tonight. We're just so thankful for everything that you mean to us, Lord. Oh God, as we gather here, Lord, it's not to magnify man, magnify a system, magnify some brotherhood, but we are here to worship and magnify you, Father. And we realize the more that we learn to do that, the more you will pull us into yourself. I find it to be phenomenal that the more we give to you, the more of yourself you give to us. I'm so grateful for that. It's no wonder to me that Satan has so many of the preachers out in religious worlds today just focusing constantly on the people, the people, the people, the people, the people. Because the devil knows if they ever magnify you and ever see who you are, what a thing it does. So I pray we would not be guilty of that. Lord, open our eyes tonight. That we can see you and the magnitude of your love by the gifts and the great treasures that you bestow upon your people. You saw all the hands are uplifted. We're just asking you that you'd be mindful of us tonight, Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated. The word sill you him. Sill you him. That's a Hebrew word for dowry. For us as westerners, the dowy doesn't really mean much of anything. But let me read it to you so you'll understand it. The dowy was given to the bride by her father to equip her for her new life. It's also part of her inheritance. Let me read it to you again. Given to the bride by her father to equip her for her new life, part of her inheritance. Now the dowy, the Bible here in Genesis of course doesn't mention it, but Rebecca actually would have been given a dowy not from Abraham, not from Isaac, but from her paternal and maternal parents, of course. And it would have included part of the fortune as far as what they had. It may have included things old and things new. Things that were more of a family inheritance, things that would have been a treasure to them and them only. Other people would look at and say, "I wouldn't have that piece of junk. I don't know what that even is." But to that family, it would have been something very special. Now, she's going to leave with this man and depart. Never come back. Actually, never see them again. And yet they want to give her something from her parents that will be able to identify her in that lineage even though she will be so very far away. So the dowy was very very important. Now it's not just something in the past for some some marriages and some cultures and so on. They still do the same thing today. So they would give that then to the daughter because the daughter did not receive a divided portion of the inheritance when it come to land, cattle, sheep, oxen and so on. It was divided among the sons. And you remember one of the men in the Old Testament whenever Moses was there that they had to have a special hearing because the man had no sons. And then they went to God and God said, "Well, because there is no sons, let the daughters have a part of it." But that was not the norm. The norm was that the sons would get it and the eldest son would get a double portion. So if you had seven sons, the inheritance was divided by eight, which meant the eldest son got two parts. But here now the dowy was something totally for the female only. No bridegroom got a dowy. That was not his. It was for the bride only. You know, as I begin to look at this, I've realized that the bride of Christ also has a dowy, something given to her from who? Not from her husband, but from her father. Now, we're in a very strange relationship as far as when it comes to our relation to deity. Now, let me explain it to you this way. Actually, our father had a son. Now that son was only a human embodiment or a human tabernacle by which the father could get into and create a blood and shed that blood so that he could redeem his people. Now that father is that great being of course that is light and his spirit and he was not a man but he gave to the world. He gave also to us of course his only begotten son. Now remember only begotten at that time. So he was the only begotten son at that time. And what was that? It was a human temple by which the father could dwell in in order to redeem and pay the price to bring us back. So here he plays two parts. So spirit God is our father and then the father himself gives birth to a son when before the foundation of the world but at that time he wasn't even a human he was the logos. So then he condescends from being the logos to becoming a human being. Now but we still have this wonderful relationship with spirit God which is our father. Now remember the body the human body of the Lord Jesus is not your father. &gt;&gt; The human body of the Lord Jesus is not your father. As a matter of fact he wasn't his own father. The human body was a body of time that God created and it was his own body and he called it sunship. Now watch in though believers then are given gifts by the father to equip them for their new life and for their journey as they're heading to be able to meet their bridegroom. Read with me in Matthew 7 11. If ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your father, now notice the position from which these gifts are coming from? They say, "What difference does it make?" Oh, it makes all the difference in the world. You see, or if you were here and you were a gentile and you would have called out, "Son of David, son of David, have mercy on me." You know what? you would have got absolutely nothing &gt;&gt; because you were claiming the wrong dispensational title. &gt;&gt; So you could only get from God and remember the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God. So that's why they can scream the name of Jesus in the day we're living in and hardly get nothing out of it. But it will be revealed in what he said the thunders. So when the voice of God makes his message known in every day, it will be the word interpreted for the age that the elect of God live in, they will be caught by that word. The others will pass right on by, join church, join religion, become religious, all that sort of thing, and miss it a million miles. But we don't want to do that, do we? &gt;&gt; Now notice then where the source of these great gifts come from. How much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him? How many like to know tonight what your dowy a little bit of it includes? Well, if it's yours, wouldn't you want to know your sisters whenever you got married? Now, if your father would have said, "Now, honey, whenever you get married, daddy's got something for you." I'll tell you what, daddy is going to give you a a surprise. It's going to be a gift. And your daddy was a wealthy man and you know, a man that was equipped to do it. And you'd be anxious, of course, thinking, "Oh my, what's daddy going to give me? Is he going to give us a house? Is he going to give us $1,000, $10,000? What's dad going to give you?" Well, let me just share with you tonight what our heavenly father has already given to us. It ain't going to be $1,000. It ain't going to be $10,000. As a matter of fact, it will be riches that you can't even think about without God helping you to do it. There will be so much of it that God will give to us just in this life. If this life contains so many beneficial blessings and great things of what he wants us to do, I cannot imagine what the world that is to come is going to be like. Now, let's look at and we'll start from the basic foundation of where we come to him. And let's look at being forgiven. Oh, aren't you glad you're forgiven tonight? Romans 4:7 saying, "Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sins are covered, whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sins are covered." Now, think of that old life that you used to live. Now, the downside is that us of human beings that we can still remember the wrongs that we've done. We can remember how bad they were, how terrible they were, how awful we felt when we done them. But there's one great thing I know. Our God remembers none of them against us. Thank God. Ephesians 4:32. And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ sake hath forgiven you. Now, this is why we are forgiven. It's not because we deserve it. It's not because we held our hands a certain way or we said certain words when we pray. God forgave you for Christ's sake. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the church said &gt;&gt; as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. Colossians 2:13. And you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your hearts, has he quickened together not apart from him, but with him? Has he quickened together with him? You mean to tell me that I was already quickened before I was ever even born? You was already identified in the quickening power of God before you ever draw one breast in your human body. How can that be? What if Adam lost my inheritance before I was born? The second Adam regained my inheritance before I was born. Come on, somebody. Now, you realize it's the work of God and the grace of God that's done it. And you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, has he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all, oh, praise God, all trespasses. Colossians 2:14, blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us. Now, I want you to listen to this. I was so curious about these words. So, I've done a little research and got to looking at it and I found the meanings of this verse. I thought it's so awesome. I wanted to share it with you. The burdens, some requirements of the law have been abolished. And of course, it's superseded by the death of our Lord Jesus. But what it leads up to is the word handwriting signifies an acknowledgment signed by us that we owe a certain amount. Now the handwriting that was against us, we actually had to acknowledge it ourself. So here was all this debt. Here was all this that we've done and we had to acknowledge it and we had to take our own handwriting as it were and acknowledge I am guilty of this and this and this and this and this and God in that sense made us acknowledge it. You say, "When, Brother Donnie, when did that happen?" When you come to an altar and you begin to acknowledge, "Lord God, I'm a low down rotten sinner. I've drunk. I've lied. I've stole. I've cheated. I've done this. Don't you understand what you was doing?" Your own personal handwriting will say, "I'm a sinner. I'm no good. I'm no count. If God don't help me, there ain't no hope for me." And God said, "All right, now that you've signed it and you admit the bill is too large for you, this is what I am going to do for you in exchange." Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to the cross. So he took all that we did by our personal acknowledgment and he took it from us and he took that oh glory to God that agreement that we said yep I deserve it I ain't no good I ain't worth even living oh my and he said I'll tell you what I'm going to do now I'm going to take that and I'm going to nail it to the cross what a peculiar way to say that remember it was the Lord for Jesus who was nailed to the cross and yet your sins being identified as being lost and wretched and he took that and nailed it to the cross. Why? Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5, he who knew no sin became sin that we might become the very righteousness of God in him. Listen little bride, this is part of your gallery. This is something that even after you get saved, it gives you hope because guess what? You're still going to fall flat on your face. You're still going to make mistakes. You're still going to mess up. &gt;&gt; But can't that same God who buried, oh, hallelujah, that died and buried and rose again? Cannot that same God that took that handwriting that was against you forgive you now to your sons and daughters of God? Oh, praise be to God. So, here is this massive sum on the bill that I owed all of this debt. My body, my soul, my temperament, my character, everything that I was was absolutely obligated to that. So, it brought me under the state of condemnation. The only thing he wanted me to do was acknowledge it. Just acknowledge it that you're lost, that you're wretched, that you cannot do it without me. And I will take it for you. I become that for you. But it will not do you any good until you acknowledge that you need a savior. Oh, no matter how great he is, how wonderful he is, he can only save you if you'll let him. He can only heal you tonight if you'll let him. He can only encourage you tonight. I wish somebody would preach with me. He can only encourage you. He can only lift you up. He can only be your peace, your joy, your satisfaction if you'll receive it from him. But if you won't let him, he can't do it. All of heaven, hallelujah, is at your disposal there. If you'll call upon his name and say, "Lord, I am a member of your bride. It's part of my dowy." A dowry is not for you in the millennium. It's not for you at the marriage supper of the lamb. It's given to you for your journey from here to there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Having spoiled principalities and powers. Oh, I love this. He made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it. Triumphing over them in it. Right in the middle of it. He triumphed over hell. 1 John 2:12, I wrote unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake. Do you understand that? It brings glory to his name for every sinner that will accept him as their savior. Praise the Lord. Now, remember, of course, friends, that many folks will be saved that will not be bribed. Oh, of course there will. There'll be all kinds of people that'll be saved because they're trusting Jesus as their savior. I don't want him just to be my savior. I want him to be my Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, a lot of people, oh yes, oh Lord, please save me. Save me from hell. But Lord, don't you tell me what I can live now. Don't you tell me what I can wear and I can't wear and I can't go here and I can't go there and now. Lord, don't tell me that. Well, you say they want him as savior, but they don't want him as Lord, but the bride wants him as Lord. I said the bride wants him as her Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Notice another gift now that the father wanted to impart to his children was the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Oh my, how we appreciate the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Now, I'm not talking about being baptized in your spirit, but I'm talking about your soul becoming illuminated by the very breath of God. The same breath of God that breathed into Adam was the very same breath of God that told the disciples and St. John receive ye the Holy Ghost and he breathed on them and a few days later the breast come into the upper room. &gt;&gt; So it was a delayed reaction but they caught up with it. Now the same Lord Jesus notice what he says in St. John 14:16. I will pray the father. I here's our Isaac now. I will pray to the father. Abraham in the type. I will pray to the father and he will give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever. Now remember the disciples were hearing some of these things for their first time. And they were hearing talking about leaving and going away. I'm not sure they didn't want him to go away. But Jesus tells them here in St. John 14, it is expedient for you that I go away because if I don't go away, the comforter cannot come. What is it another person of the Godhead? No, it's actually the same person of the Godhead but in a different manifestation. One that the church could receive. We could not receive the corporal body of Jesus in our body. &gt;&gt; Well, if I got the corporal body of Jesus in my body, then none the rest you ain't got the Holy Ghost. or if you got it, I ain't got the Holy Ghost. But what's he going to do? Change himself. Now God is a spirit and God gave birth to a spirit son, which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Now notice Jesus saying that I will pray the father and the father will give you a comforter. Notice even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive. So a person that comes up to receive salvation, they cannot receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; According to Jesus, &gt;&gt; I guess he knew more about it than preachers. What do you think? &gt;&gt; The world cannot receive the Holy Ghost, but the world can receive salvation. &gt;&gt; But not the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is for a vessel that has come through a process. A sinner comes straight from the world. They come to the Lord Jesus, receive him as their savior. The process starts and many of them never go any further than being saved. &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. So, the Holy Ghost is not just for saved people. It's for people who are saved and sanctified and they're cleansed and they're ready to receive a filling on the inside. So God don't bring a sinner up to the altar and that sinner smoking, drinking, lying, committing adultery, got all them demons inside their body and God filled that person with the Holy Ghost. Are you kidding me? God sharing that soul with demons. &gt;&gt; No way. So that person has to go through a purging, a cleansing, a sanctification process to receive the Holy Ghost. And who's Jesus speaking this to? to men who are finalizing their stage of sanctification, even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him ought not and knowice. Now notice so you mean you can't receive him if you don't know who he is. &gt;&gt; So what if you're taught he's a third person? &gt;&gt; Well, that ain't who he is. And if you don't see him as he is, &gt;&gt; oh, brother Tony, what about you? What about you? I turned Pentecost. Did you have the Holy Ghost? Oh, yeah. I had a baptism, &gt;&gt; but I didn't have the person. &gt;&gt; I shouted. I run. I jumped. I spoke in tongues. I preached. I prayed for sick and watch them get well. All kinds of things. And still preach false doctrine. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz I was ignorant to it. I wasn't intentionally doing it. I was blind. Well, if I'd had the Holy Ghost in my soul according to Jesus, wouldn't that spirit of truth led me to the truth? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him, but ye know him. For he dwelleth with you and shall be in you. &gt;&gt; Who's he talking about? The Lord Jesus himself, not his body, the pillar of fire coming back to break itself up. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you one thing, it's quite awesome. If you look in question answers 64, and you'll find the prophet of God saying, "The same pillar of fire is on the earth today anointing sons of God to bring the word to the bride." It's absolutely phenomenal quote. Notice in St. John 14:18, I will not leave you comfortless. I &gt;&gt; will come to you. &gt;&gt; So you mean it's Jesus? &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost in the upper room was Jesus. &gt;&gt; Well, wait a minute. But the Bible said that they saw tongues of fire. They didn't see the corporal body. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What was it? spirit son. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Notice little bride. Oh, let's open our little diary package tonight and see what's on the inside. What do you say? Here's another little thing that God wanted to give to to his daughter, the bride, who's going to be married to his son, the word. You see, the whole family is a word family. And God can designate what portion of the word that he wants the son to fulfill. He designates what portion of the word that he wants the bride to fulfill. And then he also designates the portion of the word that he himself will fulfill as father god. As father god's spirit form he could not die for us because the spirit cannot die. As father god he had no blood. So what did he do? He took that portion of the word and created a son and lived inside that son, that human body. Hallelujah. In order to pay the price, oh that we could be set free. &gt;&gt; Notice St. John again 14:27. Peace I leave with you. My peace I give unto you. How many of you all tonight will be honest and say you need more peace in your life? &gt;&gt; I understand we're living in a troubled world, are we not? &gt;&gt; We're living in a world when people will not even disagree politically or on, you know, different values of this and that and the other without trying to kill you. I'm sure you heard again today there was another uh sniper and they uh had shot at some ICE agents and it's it's the time that we're living at. Well, brother Darn, you think about that? Of course I do. My own life's been threatened many times. Do I think about it? Sure I think about it. But you know what I told Carol the other day? We can't live under the spirit of fear and thinking all, you know, oh my goodness, I can't get out. I can't go here. I can't go there. I will not live that way. God does not want me to live that way. How can I not live that way? Peace. &gt;&gt; Peace. I believe he brought me on the earth to serve his purpose. There ain't enough devils in hell. There ain't enough 30 odd sixes, 270s, whether they're Remington or whether be Magnum. There ain't enough cannons. There ain't enough whatever more to take me out of here until God is done with me. Come on, somebody. If I didn't believe that, I'd be mighty discouraged tonight. The way I look at it, if I'm flying on a 747 or whatever and that thing crashes, if it ain't the will of God for me to go, I'll be the only survivor out in the middle of the Himalayan mountains or wherever it is. And they're thinking, "How in the world did that man live? I'll tell you how he lived because God wasn't done with him yet." And you and I need to get away from the fear that the devil controls our life and the devil numbers our days. No, he don't. He didn't bring me on the earth. He can't take me off the earth until God's done. Hallelujah. I am God almighty son and you are his child, his son or daughter. And the devil has to back off because God is the one who's in control of our lives. &gt;&gt; Y'all forgive me tonight. I'm feeling a little Church of Christy. Amen. &gt;&gt; My peace I give unto you. Not as the world giveth give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled. Neither let it be afraid. So you mean you and I have some control over our heart being troubled &gt;&gt; and being afraid. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Romans 1:7. To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints, grace to you and peace from both Abraham and Isaac, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, to all that be in Rome. I I met a brother, let me share this with you. I met a brother in Switzerland and he come up to me. He couldn't speak English very well, but he had a younger guy there. He spoke English really well and he said, "This is my this is my pastor and he he wants to invite you to Rome." So, I got a church in Rome. So, this this pastor, big tall guy, he told him, he said, "Tell him to come and preach where Paul preached Rome." Well, I may never go to Rome to preach, but this scripture right here, even though I'm not a Roman, it's got my name wrote all over it. &gt;&gt; What about us? Some of you Indiana people, Tennessee people, Arkansas people, is this scripture just good for the Roman brothers and sisters, or is it good for us as a people of God? to all that be in Rome. Notice how he directs to beloved. Beloved of God, not just loved, not just love. Beloved is a higher degree of love, special one who is worthy of grace. Chew on that a while. Oh my. Beloved of God, called to be saints. You're not just called to be saved. You're not just called to come up through the tribulation period. You're called to be saints of the most high God. &gt;&gt; Grace to you and peace from God our father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Romans chapter 5 verse one. Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace, amen, with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Not peace from God now in this application, but peace with God. Why would he say it that way? Cuz we were born at war with God. &gt;&gt; We were born at war. Oh my. Aren't you glad you ain't at war with God no more? Oh my. I'd rather be at war with this world. I'd rather be at war with the devil. I'd rather be at war with demons every day of my life than to be at war with God. At one time, I was at war with God. All of you were too. You might as well say, "Amen." But how in the world did I ever make peace? It was not me that made peace. It was my Isaac. It was my Isaac that paid the price. And he said, "You don't have to no longer be at war with my father. I will make and tear down the middle wall of petition. And I will bring you both together, Father God and man. &gt;&gt; And I will be your shalom." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Romans 15:13. Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing. Wow. Fill you with all joy and peace. I'm a believer. I'm a believer. Well, do you have joy and peace and you're believing? &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm the happiest person in the world. Well, let your face know about it. Rest of us, too. Okay. Oh, I'm so glad I'm saved. Thank God. I hope I die today. I'm so sick of this life. I'm so sick of it. And you got all joy and peace. You sorry dog. You ain't telling the truth. The devil's robbed you. Your diary is sat there. I mean, you got gold and riches and treasures and saffron and you've got needles of purple and blue and all kinds of things piling out of your diary chest. And you're sitting there all puffed up like a bullfog eating buckshot. And you're sitting there sad and down and depressed and weary. It's time that we rise up pride and say, "I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired. I'm sick of the devil stealing my joy. I'm sick of the devil stealing my children. I'm sick of the devil interrupting our home. Oh, hallelujah. I am grateful tonight that we have peace with God. &gt;&gt; Now, the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing. Brother Mike, I just seen you. That's the sneakiness preacher right there I've ever seen in my life. that you may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghost. Oh, Philippians 4:7. And the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. The peace of God which passeth all understanding. Notice what's going to keep your hearts and your mind. The peace of God, brother Malca. That's your ability to quote scripture. Well, I I pay my tithes and and I go to church and and I pray for brother Donnie once every every now and then whenever I think about it and and I do kind deeds and I do this and no Lord, I ain't got no peace. That's not what that's not what does it. It's the power of God. And the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. Colossians 3:15. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts. Look at the meaning of this word &gt;&gt; to be an umpire. to decide, determine, direct, &gt;&gt; control. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You mean peace? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Peace. The peace of God can be like an umpire. All right. So, the picture gets ready. &gt;&gt; He's doing them finger and all that whatever they do back there. Boy, he ready on. He whining her up. He's getting ready on. Boy, he sold that thing today. He boy said bow and the devil I I mean the pitcher said why he he struck out I that old boy it ain't in him to to hit a home run. Oh but it is. You see it's in us to hit a home run. Every member of the bride has a built-in mechanism to have a home run. Why? We come from home and we're going back and we're running on the way back. So we are doing a home run. We're not squatting. We're not sitting. We're not going to be pushed in a wheelchair. And they ain't going to roll us in on a stretcher somewhere. But the bride's doing a home run. So get out of our way, devil. And the peace of God is going to be the umpire in my heart. I may feel down, but the umpire says it's joy unspeakable and full of glory, but I don't feel it. You sure it wasn't a strike? I mean, I'm going to sit down if you want me to. I think I struck out. I think I I think I struck out. He said, "You knucklehead you didn't ain't had but one throw at you. I don't know where you figured you struck out." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; So the devil winds up another one. &gt;&gt; Boy, here comes that ball at 100, whatever it is. And you just know for get I'm struck out. I'm struck out now. And you're saying, "Wow, you mean I'm still saved? Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I wish we could let the umpire rule in our hearts." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you get up in the morning and you check your phone, you go look at all the texts and all the emails and, you know, all this and that and other all filled with all that negative stuff. Sometimes I wish uh some of us didn't even have a smartphone cuz it sure don't make us too much smarter, does it? Before we ever leave the house, we're so down and wore out and depressed and so much going on in this crazy world that we're living in and we let our phone control our hearts instead of the peace of God. You let your phone be your umpire. You let Fox News be your umpire. You let CNN be your umpire. I'll tell you one thing, you're letting the devil rob you, friends. Let the peace of God be your umpire. And listen to what he's saying. If he says walk, walk. [Applause] Well, the umpire is truthful. And the truth of it is tonight, he's telling us, some of us, that we're close to striking out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of you done struck twice. You better listen to what the umpire is saying. He said, "Boy, you better let me have control of your life. You better let me have control of your emotions. You better let me have control of your life. And let me be the umpire. I'll make the calls for you. And it's not dry calls. It's calls with power. &gt;&gt; If he says you're happy, well, I guess you ought to act like it. &gt;&gt; Let the peace of God rule &gt;&gt; in your hearts to the which also ye are called in one body. And be ye &gt;&gt; sad and depressed. &gt;&gt; Thank God. What? &gt;&gt; Thankful. &gt;&gt; Thankful. Ain't that awesome? Now, if that wasn't enough, well, let me look over there. What is that? Oh my goodness. Let me reach down in there and pull out of that dowy box. Oh my goodness. Can that be true? Yeah. This little this little item in your diary is called we are his workmanship. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 2:10, for we are his workmanship. &gt;&gt; How many of y'all believe God makes junk? &gt;&gt; Does God specialize in trash? Does God specialize in good for nothings? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; All of us are known by our works. &gt;&gt; A sister that can bake and cook and you know, no matter what, if it's a country cook or whatever it is, she know that. Oh yeah, we're having a dinner. Be sure now and get sister so and so's beans. I'm telling you what, them beans are to die for. If Sister Angel Smith makes that chocolate cake, you stand right there in line. You get your cake. Somebody's going to bring that delish stuff and this and that and the other. Why? You're identified. If Sister Barbara brings some of them black cookies, oh man, alive. Them no bakes. I mean, get up there and get it. Boy, whenever we go to heaven, our fall festival here in a little bit. And some of y'all get in line. Boy, I'm going here. I'm going there. Oh yeah, brother so and so does that. They make them deer nuggets and they cut that up and they wrap that in that bacon. I'll tell you what, I'm slobbering right now thinking about it. Why? Because the worst. Now, what if it tasted like tar? What if it tasted like tarpentine with a little bit of sulfur and a little bit of apples, you know, asphalt on the side and you dip it over an oil? You know, you'd say, "Don't never go to that booth. That stuff will make you sicker than a dog." You're identified by your works. You're identified by what you put out. Almighty God's reputation. If he does not produce a bride that is like himself, &gt;&gt; he is an absolute liar and failure. But I ain't worried about that happening. Are you? My God don't make no junk. He don't make no trash. He don't make hallelujah something that he cannot trust. My God will complete his work. [Applause] You see that stone column right there? That's my workmanship. You see this one? That's brother Dave Swanson's workmanship. Now, you study the way they're laid and you'll see I've got a style and he has a style. The sign out on the road, my style. Simon in the in the the fireplace over there, mine and his together. So you see, God is identified by his workmanship. So on the day of Pentecost, the great contractor come down himself and he said, "Boy, I'm tell you one thing. Now these old boys, they're they're something. These boys are something, but just wait till I get done with them. Just wait till I get work done working on Peter. He is going to make me a fire brand like the devil ain't never heard nothing about it before. You wait till John gets the Holy Ghost. Him and James. I mean, they're the sons of thunder. I named them that. But boy, wait till they get the Holy Ghost. It'll turn John from a son of thunder into love itself. It'll totally transform John. It'll change Thaddius. It'll even change Mary. It'll change them all. Why? Because they are going to Lord have mercy. They're going to be my workmanship. And when I get done with them, even the angels of God will circle the earth with their heads bowed as they look at my work. [Music] So the astronomers say that there's over one setillion stars in the visible universe. So that's a one with 21 zeros. That's quite impressive, isn't it? &gt;&gt; I mean, I know y'all know the word septanian all the time. That's how much money you've got, right? &gt;&gt; If you're playing Monopoly, maybe. But that was not the height of his creation. The height was when he said, "Let us make man in our image." And the prophet tells us that God wanted a world filled with sons and daughters. Now, he knew when he made this little blue dot and put it out in this Milky Way, and he knew that it would be one of the smallest. Had it been just a bit closer to the sun, it been too hot for life to survive. &gt;&gt; Had it been just a little farther away, it would have been too cold. But he placed it right in what they call the habitable zone. Habitable zone. So, they're spending all kinds of money trying to find another planet like this one. I I'll go ahead and tell them. I mean, NASA won't listen to me anyway, you know, but they're not going to find one. &gt;&gt; The Earth is the only planet whose name is in the book of life, &gt;&gt; which is the Bible. Jupiter, Neptune, Mars, Saturn, none of them are there. Why don't God throw this earth away and make another one? He cannot. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because this earth is his attribute. &gt;&gt; And remember, he come on the earth and took his own body out of the 16 elements &gt;&gt; of this earth. And the Lord God never had a permanent flesh body until Jesus. &gt;&gt; Now that body sits at the right hand of the spirit thrown universe there to make intercession for us. For we are his workmanship created. I was at the stone yard Monday getting some stone for a little bit of landscaping I've been doing over here at the church. And the guy there that he knows me and I bought quite a bit from him and he said, ' Do you know this man? I said, 'N no. And I I was over there picking up rocks one at a time. So this guy, they picked up a pallet and scooted it through on his truck and loaded it on the truck. Well, the guy that owned that truck, he come over to me and he said, "I was going to tell you they do load them up. I said, "Yeah, sir." And I was going to ask you, "Was you holding your breath the whole time that's loading them up in the back of that brand new Ford truck of yours?" And then the guy suddenly has said, "Oh, he comes here all the time talking about me." He said, "He's one picky fell. He goes out there in that yard and he picks them up one at a time and looks at him." Well, you see, I have something in my mind &gt;&gt; that I want it to look like. So, I finished most of it for the most part today. So, I was up here taking pictures of it and sending it to Carol. So, I get my phone down like this. I get as people pass by and said, "That's the preacher." You imagine how the people are that go to church there. He's out there taking pictures of dirt. So this one had little green specks and that one had little silver and this one had this and that one had that. And I sent Carol a little caption down at the bottom of it. Handpicked rocks. And she answered back, "That's the best kind." So you see that is a mirror of my work. That's my workmanship. Each of you are known by your word. Then how would we ever believe that God would have to settle for a faulty, flawed church that barely makes it to church once every now and then, and they can't quit overcoming sin and lying and all kinds of filthy habits. And the great creator has to settle for that. Well, I guess I just have to settle for that. &gt;&gt; No, sir. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works. We are his making. And these virtues that we've been talking about for several several weeks, that's the creation unfolding in our lives. You see, we are his making. We are created by him and for him. Now, it's more than just the general sense of rocks and trees and cattle and all that sort of thing. But this is a new creation. Now, look at the word created. I about had a spell when I looked at this. We're created in Christ Jesus. And it means to make habitable. habitable to people, a place, a region, an island. Hence to found a city, a colony, a state, to form, shape, to completely change or transform. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for what? What? &gt;&gt; Good works. You see, this is why a person that really has the Holy Ghost, it's it's just as easy for them to do good works as it is an an evil person to do bad works. &gt;&gt; That's just their nature. Because their old nature has been annihilated and the workmanship of the almighty God has been recreated in their soul. You're quite something. You know that if you are born again, you are quite something. &gt;&gt; For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. Oh my. God ordained you and I to live a holy life. And the church said God ordained us to live a life of holiness &gt;&gt; and purity and separation. &gt;&gt; Now the word here that that Paul used to means to prepare beforehand is to predestinate or to appoint before it. It includes the idea of a previous determination or an arrangement beforehand for securing a certain result. &gt;&gt; Ah, so if you want a certain result and you're dealing with old dirt bags, you better predetermine. &gt;&gt; There ain't no telling what you'll come out if you don't. So God said, "Now this is going to be the greatness and the height of my creation. I will put my sons and daughters in mortal flesh. I will put them in that oil. I I I will put them in that and I will predestinate them. It is in my being. It is in my being to give me a purpose, a reason to be." I'll let you think on that for a minute. The previous preparation of the divine intention. You see, and Paul said that we should walk in them. Watch again. Ephesians chapter 2:1. Wherefore remember that ye being in time past, Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision, that at that time ye were without Christ. Oh my, remember that. I don't ever want to go back to that again. &gt;&gt; Being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel. Oh my. and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. &gt;&gt; And I'd like to preach to you sometime on these two words, but now that's what I was, but now. But now in Christ Jesus, ye who sometimes were a far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace, &gt;&gt; who has made both one Jew and Gentile, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us. He is our peace. So the Lord Jesus died for both Jew and Gentile to make in them one new man. The new man, the new creation is what? The church. They could never do it under the Abrahamic covenant of the flesh. They could never do it under the covenant with Isaac, the covenant of Jacob. So it had to be a new covenant. A star would arise out of Jacob. A star would arise out of Jacob. not a man, not that would come down through Isaac's lineage, but a star from heaven would arise out of Jacob and he would have the scepter cuz the scepter would come and it would be whatever he would bring forth. Oh, glory to God. And he would come forth from between the feet. And what would he do? He would make in one new man. One new man called what? Jew, Gentile, the church. Oh Jesus became our shalom who has made both one form one church out of two different types of people Jews and Gentiles by abolishing the law of the covenant that was given by Moses which is only temporary only to last for a while. Notice in verse 15, chapter 2, having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances, for to make in himself of twain one new man. So here he comes to take within himself the Jewish law, the Jews take within himself and merge the Gentiles in himself. And then once they come in him, the product out of that the two become one &gt;&gt; called what? The church. &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh. For to make it himself of twain one new man, so making peace, that he might reconcile both unto God in the one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby, and came and preached peace to you who were a far off, and to them that were nigh, Jew and Gentile. And through him we both have access. Here you go, little bride. Here are some more of your little dowy. Access the act of bringing to approach to God. That relationship with God whereby we are acceptable to him and have assurance that he is favorably disposed towards him, &gt;&gt; permitted to approach God through his name. Aren't you glad tonight? So here the Greek word here relates the word that Paul chose to use was someone seeking an audience of a great personage and an officer would go between the person seeking the audience and the one they're seeking the audience from. It was a person that was greatly trusted and one that had authority. And this deputy, this magistrate, this person mediator in our state would go between them and say, "Sir, he wants to see you. He wants to see you." And I I want to sue you and say that I I think that you should see him. I think you should take time with him or with her and to help him that I I think that that they are worthy of it. They are worthy of it. Oh, children, they are worthy of it. They are worthy of it. You imagine the book of Revelation, the worthy one saying to the church, "For ye will walk with me in white, for ye are worthy." &gt;&gt; So here we come to the approach, not to a stern, angry God. And you've heard me tell it before when I was a trinitarian and I didn't know how to pray. And I'd pray to the father and I'd pray to the son. I'd pray to the holy ghost. And I go back, forget which one I'd prayed to. &gt;&gt; You think, "Well, that's pretty far out." Well, brother Brandham said he used to think that God hated him and Jesus loved him. &gt;&gt; He said till he found out that's the same person. &gt;&gt; So the wrath of God was swallowed up in the heart of the Lord Jesus. And he settled my account. My signature was on there. I said I was guilty. I agreed. I lied. I agreed. I'd done wrong. I agreed. I validated it with my own signature. He said, "Sign it, Donnie, and let me have it." &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Ephesians 2:19. Now, therefore, ye are no more strangers, alien from a person or a thing, without the knowledge of, without a share in, oh no. Oh my. Unheard of. One who receives and entertains, another hospitably, and who stays or lodges. You're no longer strangers and foreigners. One who lives in a place without the right of citizenship. That was me. Metaphorically without citizenship in God's kingdom. one who lives on earth as a stranger, a souljourer on earth of Christians whose fatherland is in heaven. You were strangers and foreigners, but now fellow citizens possessing the same citizenship with others. A fellow citizen of Gentiles is received into the communion of the saints of the people consecrated to God. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Notice this. fellow citizens with the saints and the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and the prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone, and whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord. Fitly framed together was a carpenter term. It meant to join together as a carpenter would join together the framework of a building. Oh, praise God. So, the materials are exactly cut by whom? God himself. So, we have some of the church that'll be like this. We'll have some preachers that'll preach this way, some that are preached that way, some that are preached the other way. Thank God for it. He knows exactly what to make. Is that right? So he does the same in your life as a lay person and God will take that and bring it all together. And what Paul identified in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth. Wow. What a strange building. This building is a growing building. growing high in faith and virtue and knowledge. &gt;&gt; Whoa. As far as number wise and all that close we get to the end, we ain't going to grow so much in number. I figure we're going to get smaller and smaller. &gt;&gt; There'll be more and more that'll turn away. Not only that, we're getting more on the other side than we got left here. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; But the building is growing. growing in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord. The growth of the church is not measured by how many new people you get. &gt;&gt; I mean, go out and knock on people's doors and try to bring them to the message. We try to hand out, you know, doctrinal things and this and that. No, this this growth here, it's not so much the natural. In whom also ye are builded together for a habitation of God through the spirit. In the book of Genesis, God walked with his people. But in Exodus, he decided to dwell with his people. Exodus 25:8 in the tabernacle also chapter 40:34 until Israel's sin caused the glory of God to leave the tabernacle. But then once again God appears on the earth in the body of Jesus, his own personal human temple, that the spirit of God could dwell in that structure. Let's read and I'll close your just momentarily. Ephesians 3:1, "For this cause I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God, which is given me to youward, how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote a four and few words, whereby that when you reach you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ, which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men. Now, no doubt there were Christians in that day that was not concerned about the mystery of Christ. They just wanted to be saved, &gt;&gt; saved from hell, go to church, you know, do a little bit of this, a little bit of that. Now, we know that had to be there because that church had already started riding. The white horse rider had already started riding and made a twin to the real identified church. So, they just thought, "All you got to do is believe. You just believe and you accept it and that's it. But Paul said, "Oh, no, no, no. There's much, much more. There's many mysteries here that if you're part of that elect, you'll enter into that great place with God, which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men. It is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit, that the Gentiles should be fellows of the same body." Can you imagine now some of them Jews sitting there? &gt;&gt; Now Paul wrote this to the church in Ephesus which is mainly Gentiles. &gt;&gt; You imagine some of them Jews struggling but they ain't them. They ain't fit to sit with us. Wow. They men ain't even circumcised. Somebody told me they seen them eating barbecue pork. Lord have mercy. They eat eggs. Ah, I I can't believe they they they say they got the same thing we do. You imagine some of them had the office time ever was. And you hear Paul telling them, "Look, brothers, they're heirs just like you are." Oh, don't you tell me that God spoke to Moses and God spoke to Abraham and God said, "This is an everlasting covenant. How you going to break an everlasting covenant, Paul? You're a false prophet." He said, "I'm telling you, brothers, it's a mystery. Will you show me where Moses said them Gentiles would come in? Paul, &gt;&gt; come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Let's take Paul to the Torah. Now, Paul, I want you to show me one scripture in the Torah that said he'd have a gentile bride and divorce Israel. Now, what would you done? You're first century believers. &gt;&gt; Some of you Jews, some of you Gentiles. &gt;&gt; And y'all come to Word of Life Church. And I stand up here to preach and I'm reading from Paul's books. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; And putting it up on the screen. &gt;&gt; But now remember in that day to a lot of those people, they did not consider those books scripture. or sacred. &gt;&gt; But some of them did. &gt;&gt; They saw it and they realized Paul had things that Peter couldn't touch. &gt;&gt; And word of life said, &gt;&gt; Paul preached things James didn't understand one thing about. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Why? It was given to a prophet of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So has it been in this day, and I thank God for it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Wherefore I was made a minister according to the gift of grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power unto me who am less than the least of all saints. In this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unarchable riches of Christ. This word uncarchable means astonishing and boundless treasures of grace which God has given to us and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created all things by Jesus Christ. So in the heart of God was this secret counsel to make a people like himself. Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; How many is grateful for your dowy? &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together. Praise God. He is our peace. PE who has broken down every wall. Here our peace. His peace. He is our peace. who has broken down every wall. He is our peace. [Music] He is our peace. Let's sing it together now.

Cast all your cares on him for he cares for you. [Music] He is our peace. [Music] Check. He is our peace. Oh, he is our peace. who has broken down. Can we stand our feet now as we worship him together? Oh, thank you, Lord. He is our peace. [Music] He is our peace. Oh, he is our peace. who has broken down every wall. He is our Jesus. [Music] Whatever you need tonight, children, cast your cares on him. You're sick, you're weary, you're oppressed. Cast it on him. He bore it. He bore it for you. He is our king. Oh, cast all your cares on him. Lord, he cares for you. Oh, is our peace. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Let's just close our eyes now. Can we just raise our hands? Play it, brothers. Let's just worship him now in your own way. Remember, you were one time without the Commonwealths of Israel. You were at war against God. Oh, but now not only are you just saved, but your bride called by him, chosen by him. You got a treasure box of a dowy filled with all kinds of good things. Gifts to encourage you along your way. Healing when you're sick. Oh, it's not little dime store trinkets that you'll pull out of there. He didn't go to big lots and catch it on special, but it cost him so much. Oh, hallelujah. Along your way this journey. Oh, cast all your cares on him. I know he cares for you. [Applause] He is our peace. My Lord, you are our king. [Applause] Oh, cast all your cares on him for he cares for you. He is our peace. He is our peace. I wonder how many you are tonight sick, got a need in your body, maybe a sickness, an affliction, something you're dealing with as believers, you're commissioned by God to lay hands on one another. Was down in the meetings in Kentucky with Brother Larry Hara this past weekend. Brother John Andy's did a great job. had some singing and a brother from India also there and I spoke a couple of services and at the end of the service I had the saints of God to lay their hands on one another. The anointing of God swept in that place. It was just wonderful what the Lord did. Brother Le calling me yesterday telling me of this one that was delivered. This one was healed. That one was delivered. Not not a preacher come up run them through a prayer line. Well, this famous preacher prayed for me. But saints of God lay their hand on one another. He said, "Brother Donnie, I believe that's just going to be the the beginning of great things we're going to hear that our God's doing." You know what? You get what you expect. &gt;&gt; So, if you expect a Wednesday night service, well, we ain't going to do much. I guess we'll just kind of go to church and hang out a little bit. You can hang out if you want to. I come here to worship God. &gt;&gt; And where my God is, supernatural is always made manifest. &gt;&gt; So, I want you to lay hands on one another right now, would you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, these are his words. These signs shall follow them that believe. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord Jesus. Brother Daryl, come up here and pray for the people. Hallelujah. [Music] Lord God, we believe you, Father. Hallelujah Jesus. It's in your dowy children. You can take it to the bank as we say. It will not bounce. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; this is who we are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father God. &gt;&gt; Lord, as we lay hands up on one another tonight, God, We exercise our God-given rights as believers, Lord. Believing, dear God, that heavens and earth will pass away, yet your word shall never fail, Lord. And Father God, it's written, they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover. And tonight, as sons and daughters of God, Lord, we exercise this right, God, to lay hands upon our brothers and upon our sisters, God. And we pray, God, in the name of Jesus, oh lamb of God, by that anointing that raised my Lord, from the grave. Hallelujah. And may it move, dear God, upon every need, upon every situation, God. Lord, may back trouble leave, may anxiety leave, may fear leave, may depression leave tonight in the name of Jesus Christ. May every sickness leave the people tonight. For you are our portion, dear God. You are our healer, God. You are our sustainer tonight. And we receive it, dear God. The ABCs of our healing is to accept it and to believe it and confess it. And we confess tonight, you are our healer, Satan, by the authority given to us as sons and daughters of God. We rebuke you tonight. Come out of the people. You're defeated in the name of Jesus Christ. We cast you down tonight by the power of the Holy Ghost that dwells within the hearts of the believers tonight. We receive it tonight. We accept it tonight. We confess it tonight. We are overcomers. We are the bride of Jesus Christ. We are sons and daughters of God. And every devil, every demon, sickness, death, hell itself is under the feet of the believer. And we triumph with Christ tonight in the name of Jesus Christ. We are free. The blood of the lamb of God has made us free. I accept it tonight in the name of Jesus Christ for the glory of God. Hallelujah. Boy, if you believe it tonight, raise your hand and accept it tonight. Raise your hand and reach. I challenge you to believe it in the name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah.

Oh, do you believe it tonight? &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Daryl, I don't feel one thing. He never said, "Did you feel it?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; But he said, "Did you believe it?" Yeah. &gt;&gt; If thou can believe, &gt;&gt; all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad tonight? &gt;&gt; What an hour he's been given to us &gt;&gt; to be sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We've seen it so much, friends. We've seen it so much. You've seen God. You know, Jessica came through the house one time. She's about six years old. She got that feeding tube scar in her stomach and always told her she's special cuz she looks like a belly button. She has two belly buttons. I said, "You're special. You got two belly buttons." And she went on through the house playing, just playing, you know, just six-year-old, something like that. And I was sitting at the table praying and studying Genesis 24. And I said, 'Lord, if you've done so much for her, it would be a sin for me to doubt that you couldn't take that scar off of her body. And friends, he has done so much for us, this body of believers. Is that not true? &gt;&gt; It would be a sin for us to doubt that God couldn't touch something in my life. &gt;&gt; I said, I know you could take that scar from her. And this anointing, just this warm feeling come over me. voice spoke to my heart said, "I could take that scar from her, but I left it so that every time you see it, it'll remind you of where I brought her from." &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad where he's brought us from tonight, friends? &gt;&gt; He don't remember that you ever done it, but you remember. But I wonder sometimes if we don't remember, is that to remind us of where he brought us from? &gt;&gt; Do you love him? Have you enjoyed the word of God tonight? Amen. Praise the Lord. Me and Sher's leaving in the morning for Galina, Missouri for some meetings starting out there tomorrow night and have to be at the airport at 5:00. So, we desire your prayers, the Lord, just give us traveling grace and bless the meetings. We'll have a prayer line, I think, on Saturday night. So, we certainly appreciate your your prayers and we certainly appreciate brother Donnie, don't we? What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful man of God. Amen. Let's just bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, as we come to the close of a another service, Lord, once again, oh God, have you come, Lord, and stirred our hearts. Once again, Lord, have you anointed your servant, Brother Donnie, to bring us precious words of life. And we are so grateful and we are so thankful. And Lord, tonight as a body of believers, we laid hands upon one another. And Father, I'm reminded of what your prophet told us, Lord, that if angels laid hands upon us, it would do us no good unless we accepted it. Accepted what you done. And Lord, tonight in the name of Jesus, we accept dear God that this means the way Lord of your anointing to flow from one to the other as believers laying hands. And Father, we accept that tonight as your word, Lord, and you said your word will not fail. So Lord, we accept tonight as our brothers and our sisters laid hands up on us that it was thy will being done in our lives, Lord. and we accept that which we have need of in the name of Jesus. Lord, go with your people now. Give them traveling grace and be with us tomorrow as we travel, Lord, and keep our family safe at home till we return. And we love you, Lord. We thank you once again for all that you've done for us, Lord. Be people now, Father. Renew the strength of Brother Donnie. We pray others, Lord, who was streaming tonight, not here. We pray, oh God, may the anointing go just where they're at right now, Lord, and lift that affliction off of them in the name of Jesus. That Lord, by the rising of three sons, may they know that they have been in your presence, that you have done that work in their life. Grant it, Lord, we pray as we commit these things into your hands for your glory in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you saints. You're dismissing the fear of the Lord. Remember the service this weekend.
