[0:00] I was 17 year old in boot camp at Fort
[0:02] Sill Oklahoma and I remember that night
[0:09] they got us off the blessing way March
[0:12] they put us in line and took us into
[0:14] this building we had to start taking off
[0:17] her clothes and putting them in boxes to
[0:19] ship home and started giving us all the
[0:23] same uniform and then they marched us
[0:28] over they marched us over to the barber
[0:35] and they set this boy down you know he's
[0:39] one of these pretty boys and the farmer
[0:43] said how do you want your hair son he
[0:48] said just take a living off the side and
[0:50] kind of blocking across the back he said
[0:57] no problem yeah he filled him like an
[1:05] onion true story
[1:13] didn't bother me I didn't have much to
[1:16] lose but here we were all recruits but
[1:29] they turned us into soldiers by being
[1:32] taught to endure hardness the hardness
[1:37] that we endured in basic made of
[1:39] soldiers the officers instilled into us
[1:43] the Army's concept of discipline and
[1:45] obedience we endured hours of drilling
[1:48] endless parades nowrap marches constant
[1:52] pressure tasteless food guard duty
[1:55] without sleep bullying my sergeants
[2:00] lectures exposure to inclement weather
[2:03] the whole procedure was designed to
[2:06] toughen us up to make us ready for
[2:09] battle the Roman soldiers of Paul's day
[2:12] were the toughest the most
[2:13] discipline and the most efficient
[2:15] soldiers in the world and Paul in his
[2:18] mind it was reminded of that when he
[2:19] told Timothy he was a soldier of Jesus
[2:21] Christ he had been chosen
[2:23] picked up by God and he needed to learn
[2:26] to endured the hardness that a good
[2:28] soldier does he does not quit because he
[2:31] faces difficulty tasks or dangerous
[2:33] situations he knows that his life is
[2:36] expendable many a man has gave his life
[2:39] for his brother but jesus said no man
[2:41] has laid his life down for you oh yeah
[2:50] many of good men died on the battlefield
[2:53] saving his fellow soldiers knowing you
[2:58] must be prepared to lay your life down
[2:59] when it's required brother and said a
[3:01] little man and wife these two sing a
[3:02] song it thrilled me go something like
[3:04] this
[3:04] forgive me Lord and try me one more time
[3:06] I'll be yours if you'll be mine if I
[3:08] follow if I fell let me rise and try
[3:11] again
[3:12] forgive me Lord and try me one more time
[3:14] and the Prophet said I like that for
[3:16] eating good soldiers after get wounded
[3:18] or they're apt to get hurt buddy still a
[3:21] soldier it's got a purpose of something
[3:24] to fight for
[3:24] he'll rise and try again any soldier of
[3:27] the Cross will do the same thing and I
[3:30] say to you this morning maybe you've
[3:32] been shell-shocked
[3:33] maybe something in your life a shell
[3:35] sucked you and you've got amnesia that
[3:37] you don't know where you came from now
[3:39] you don't know where you're going but
[3:40] listen to the words of brothers also
[3:42] listen to Mary say being unto me look
[3:45] back into the word and see that God
[3:47] chose you for this army god bless you in
[3:50] his army remember who you are you may be
[3:54] a wounded soldier but you're still God's
[3:57] property rise up rise up let's fight
[4:04] again knock the dust off let's go
[4:10] keep on the firing line don't act like a
[4:13] civilian you're a soldier
