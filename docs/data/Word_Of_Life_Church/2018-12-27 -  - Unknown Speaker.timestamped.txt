[0:00] revelation 20 and sex bus and holy is he
[0:03] that hath part in the first resurrection
[0:04] on such the second death has no power
[0:07] but they shall be priests of God and of
[0:10] Christ and shall reign with him a
[0:15] thousand years so the Saints will
[0:23] resurrect in glorified bodies and share
[0:27] the kingdom with the king according to
[0:32] what you have done with what God's given
[0:35] you and life will be the delegated
[0:38] authority given to you in the Millennium
[0:43] now remember it's not just about what
[0:46] God does it all and I'll just kind of
[0:48] set around one of my sons and no no no
[0:51] no you see those things you and I can do
[0:54] with what God gives us God gives you a
[0:56] gift what do you do with that gift God
[0:58] gives you an ability God puts money in
[1:00] your hands
[1:01] God puts different things in your hand
[1:03] and your reward now remember the saints
[1:05] of God will not be judged before the
[1:08] white throne judgment we go before there
[1:10] the seat of Christ but it's only for
[1:13] rewards you're going to be standing
[1:18] before him according to what according
[1:21] to what you've done what's what God put
[1:23] in your hands well I got nothing you've
[1:25] got time you've got your life you've got
[1:28] your minds you've got your wheel you've
[1:30] got all of that and God will make a
[1:32] sense of how reward is determined
[1:35] according to what we do with what God
[1:38] puts in our hands oh all better Donnie
[1:45] I'm not sure I believe that well Matthew
[1:47] chapter 19 verse 28 jesus said unto them
[1:50] verily I say unto you that ye which have
[1:52] followed me in the regeneration of the
[1:54] Son of Man will sit in the throne of the
[1:55] glory he shall also set with me upon
[1:58] twelve Thrones judging the twelve tribes
[2:00] of Israel now these of course are
[2:03] apostolic judges will everybody get that
[2:05] nope
[2:05] Matthew chapter 25 verse 21 his Lord
[2:08] said unto Him
[2:09] well done thou good and faithful servant
[2:10] thou has been faithful over a few things
[2:13] I will make thee ruler over many things
[2:18] enter thou into the joy of thy Lord now
[2:22] here we're not telling our preachers you
[2:25] ever tell my lay folks God puts things
[2:30] in our hands abilities influence gifts
[2:33] talents so on and so on your reward will
[2:36] be according to what you do with them
[2:38] now some people want to do the minimum
[2:40] requirement what do I have to do just to
[2:43] barely make it in I don't have people I
[2:50] can't even say they love God anybody
[2:53] that don't want to give him their all
[2:54] that's all he's done for us I don't
[2:56] understand it I got to be honest I just
[2:57] don't understand some folks it's like
[3:02] they're afraid they'll do too much
[3:03] really you're gonna do too much for God
[3:07] you're going to pray too much read your
[3:09] Bible too much give up too much there
[3:11] ain't no way
