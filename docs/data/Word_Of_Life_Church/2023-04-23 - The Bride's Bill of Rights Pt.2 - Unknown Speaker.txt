your your name is [Music] more time Jesus Christ [Music] Jesus Christ [Music] thank you praise the Lord what a great honor in our life to be able to worship Him and love him I know there's lots and lots of people that worship but yet we don't want to just worship we want Worship in spirit and Truth Saint John 4 of the Lord Jesus introduced something that had never been said and quite phrased the way that he did it and that was that the true worshipers would worship God in spirit and in truth which is totally impossible for the Jews to do all they had was the law the legal side so the spirit of the word they didn't even have it I think that God wanted to make a way that true worshipers would be able to come not only with the truth we want the truth right but also have the spirit of Truth this is something that people don't realize I think sometimes that both truths and error have spirits that motivate them so there's a spirit of Truth and there is a spirit of air if you ever talk to people before and you show them scriptures and you show them quotes and things like that and it seems like it makes no difference at all when you get done talking tom they believe exactly the same thing they did before you say why in the world can't you see that that's what the Bible says that thought the message says I know I know I know but I still believe this and this and this makes you feel so sorry for what does me because you realize that they're hearing the truth but they don't have the spirit of the truth that goes with it all let's let's just about here together and worship him a little bit Heavenly Father we are gathered here today with Thanksgiving in our heart and we're just so thankful Heavenly Father for all the many things that you've done for us we thank you forever trial that you and your wisdom allow to come our way we thank you Lord for the testings of life we thank you Lord Jesus that your people will be a tried people that will be far above rubies and gems and gold and things like that we know sometimes it might be difficult for us as we go through them Lord hearing from people around the world almost every day and prayer requests for this and that and some of them so desperate and so serious and you don't move form Lord there's no way for them to come out of it and yet we hear you move and you turn right around and turn that trial and that test into a testimony we're so thankful that we're serving a living God today we desire heavenly father as we come here to assemble ourselves together today set aside this Resurrection morning that we might be able to praise and adore and love and worship you but we come also Lord with needs desires and requests in our hearts Lord Jesus we're concerned of family members maybe friends or going through hard times or sick or whatever it is we also have our own needs today maybe some are standing here discouraged about many things of Life they don't know what they're going to do about this or that but we believe you're mindful of us so we're calling on Your Great Name we ask you today Father that you would help us help me that I can get out of the way Lord that I can just surrender among him and instrumentality to you you can use me I need you Lord Jesus although I've been doing this since I was just a boy of 18 years old I still realize what a desperate thing it is for a man to stand and to say he's speaking on God's behave help me Father help me give me the words Lord Jesus of life speak to each heart today heal the sick encourage those that are weary granted father we pray in Jesus name amen watch it around just shake hands just so I tell them it's good to be in the house of the Lord hey man just move out of your place our little bit and just tell them it's it's good to be in the house of the Lord praise the Lord I'm just glad you're here I've heard people say well I'd rather be here and be in the jail my goodness you mean that's the best we can do you'd rather be here and be in prison right I'd rather be here than any place else I know of on earth except for heaven amen there is no better place I don't think for us to be able to be gathered together than the house of God let's turn today again to the Book of Mark if you would chapter 16. I want to speak to you again today the Lord helping us on the bride's Bill of Rights how many of you have looked this week on what your Bill of Rights is as far as naturally some of you probably stand there last week and you thought oh my goodness I'm an American citizen I don't even know what's mine anybody look none of you don't care okay all right all right okay so you don't even care my iPad here is kind of going crazy I've had one of the office mornings that ever was so I figure the Lord I got to church and realized I didn't have a belt on so call my son-in-law and have him drop me a belt by then I get up my iPad's going absolutely nuts so that's a really good sign also I'd like to announce today that Sister Kate bitten and brother Taylor Shockley got engaged this week so we want to wish them a congratulations Mark chapter 16 verse 17. and these signs might every now and then just in the apostolic age or in the first few years these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not harm them they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover Luke chapter 10 verse 19. behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you and the church said amen amen God bless you you may be seated let me remind you again today of what your Bill of Rights is as far as an American citizen the Bill of Rights guarantees the liberty of the individual and Limits The Power of government and judicial and other proceedings the U.S Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791. and it guarantees among many other things the rights of free speech now this is the first amendment to the Constitution they later identified it as the Bill of Rights and this is what they wanted to call it so it was granted to us in 1791 freedom of speech freedom of religion and trial by jury there were initially 10 amendments in this and they called it the Bill of Rights since then since 1791 there have been 17 more amendments that's been added to that some states of course all states have to gather together have a ratification vote to be able to make it happen but as I begin to read this this week and I'm going to go through all 27 to tell you what they are but as I read what they were and I looked down at them and I thought how that they had progressed as we know whenever I our nation become separate from England and we had to fight in war and be able to get our Liberty then our founding fathers wanted to have a government that would be different than what it was in England they had under the power of the crown the king could do or clean pretty much whatever they wanted to do to the commonwealths or the constituents in their Kingdom but our fathers when they came here and they fought and they was able to establish a kingdom or a nation like this which had never been anything like it on the earth before I love it myself don't you well those of you that don't reckon you leave I mean you can go to Switzerland or somewhere but it to me it's it's one of the greatest Nations on the earth even in its darkness and the chaos that's around it and no doubt they thought it would never last because it was something that had never quite been seen But I personally believe it was the spirit of God that moved on our founding fathers and anointed them to be able to give us this which another Nation had never given to its peoples uh one reason I believe is because God knew the United States would be a principal part down Through the Ages from that time on especially ending up at the end time that the U.S would be a principal part an evangelization of the world especially with the message of the hour now God could have done whatever he wanted he could have chose Germany he could have chose France but yet one day whenever we look back and realize what a great part part that the United States has played in bringing the message of the hour now what brother random would have been in Ugandan or brother Branham would have been in Kenya now myself it wouldn't make no difference to me whether the man was black white pink or yellow was polka dot stripes on it it wouldn't make no difference to me because I personally have no problem with race I don't care what color a man is but yet God allowed this Prophet to be born out of this nation now we know that she's one of the most wealthy nations in the world and all the gross national product and all the things that are there she's not doing too good right now and we don't deaf as she's doing going down but if God would have allowed our Prophet to been born and some of the poorest Nations around the world so Dan which is now facing look like the major Corruption of a Civil War and even our embassies now having to be the people emptied out this very day and we know that this type of unrest has been of the third world countries so how would the message have ever gone out but God chose this nation now he didn't just choose her that she would be one of the most wealthy in all the world he didn't just cheers her so she would be able to dominate the world as a superpower and she's done that for many years although she's losing that image right now and our enemies well understand it but yet God chose her to me for a greater purpose than just the money and the wealth and the superiority that she would gain over the years but God had a purpose in this nation and being able to spread forth the gospel now we know that Wesley even coming from England but yet John Wesley come to the United States and got a great lot of influence and a great lot of learning of course because of the things that he went through so going back home then Wesley was able to take part of the American Experience back home with him and it helped finalize what the second work of Grace would be presented to the world again God could have chosen in England if he wanted to but God chose America now it to me it's not just a happenstance but God himself ordains that well now we know that the message has crossed the English Channel twice and God of course chose different parts of the world by which he would progress his truths and in the end time Satan moved his headquarters to the West the western side of our own nation which was of course from Hollywood now Satan would do that then Satan had a little bit of insight to what God was going to do now if Satan knew that God was going to have chosen Europe if God was going to have chosen Africa Asia whatever more to lead the world and the majority of the Gospel would come out of that I guarantee you Satan would be his headquarters it'll be set up today in Beijing or in Tokyo or wherever it was around the world why did Satan choose Hollywood why did Satan moved to the West Coast because somehow he had an insight into the Divine Providence of God that God was going to use this nation and from this nation would come the prophet of God but not only the prophet but years after he was gone but out of this nation God would use the churches and the ministry and even coming from Jeffersonville that out of there would spearhead not only the prophet himself but the prophet's message now how we thank God for the prophet himself but most of us never even got to see the man is that right so what do we hold on to the message that God gave the man well how do we know the message well thank god it's not just by Uncle so and so said so and so and my grandpa said so and so but God knew that it must be that the message would be put into book and to tape into MP3 into digital format I'm grateful for that myself now you know where a lot of this spearheaded from our own country a part of it our own church where did it come from a lot of those that if it would have been dependent on many of the brothers and sisters from the third world countries we would still be many many years behind which means a lot of us would be more spiritual regress than what we are because we have to have the word in order to feed on the word well I've got the Holy Ghost yeah and the Holy Ghost itself feeds on the word of the hour so we must have it so where does a lot of The Works come from now I don't know if you understand this or not but even in a lot of the conventions Around The World God has chosen to use a lot of American Brothers now that's not to to demoralize or to do away at all with any of the other brothers in the other parts of the world but for whatever reason God has chosen this place and to me had this nation been founded as a communistic country had it been founded as an imperialistic country or a country under a monarchy our restrictions of Liberty and tribal and so on could have been greatly affected so our founding fathers were led by the spirit of God you believe that I believe that God allowed them even with man government and Enterprise and I know you may not like it but let me tell you something I prefer it way way more than I would socialism and God knew there would have to be people around the message that he could bless financially that they would be able to help propagate the message so if all of us would have been people that just lived from hand to mouth as we say and we go from paycheck to paycheck that I wonder how far the message and the churches and books and so on and so on how far would it have reached around the world because a majority of us could have never done that so God actually allowed people that was pretty witty when it would come to business and they would be able to get out there and make all kinds of money but they wouldn't keep all of it for theirself but they would have a burden to be able to print and to be able to make mp3s and CDs and so on and so on and so on why because God wanted to get the message out to reach the bride around the world had it been in a nation where we could have not done that under Socialism or under some other type of control other than democracy then it could have been so hindered so the angels of the Lord when they go about manipulating over the top of the political schemes of Satan and then every age that he's always been there God ordained that our nation be birthed and founded on the principles of democracy I know we don't talk that much about it and y'all are probably thinking what in the world is wrong with brother Donnie that he's talking about democracy I want to open your eyes this morning you ought to thank God you live in a free Nation not only for your own Liberties and for your own freedoms but because of our freedoms and our liberties God has been able to use people from the east coast to the West Coast of this nation the North and the South to be able to propagate this truth in order to bring in the last sea now being friends with preachers around the world and when us preachers get together we will often say it this way that the last seed will be one of the most expensive Endeavors that's ever been accomplished on the face of the Earth because it will take such an Outreach to reach them in the darkest parts of Africa it will take the spirit of God and God may send one man over here and the trip May cost five thousand dollars another man over there and a trip May cost ten thousand they may not win words to Christ they may win one person one person in Sumatra whose name is on the Book of Life maybe a half a dozen in Indonesian some in Hong Kong and some here there and and there and if there was not people that God had blessed to be able to support the work we would never get out of here but thank God that he moved upon Thomas Edison John Quincy Adams a lot of our founding fathers thanked God for people like Daniel Boone and people like that that was able to blaze this oh we get in our car and drive across the Interstate we don't think nothing about these guys walking around but I'm grateful for every one of them that did it they risked their life now you believe whatever you want to believe I believe it was the spirit of God driving those men why were they not satisfied with 13 colonies why were they not satisfied when they moved into 13 states why must they keep pushing pushing pushing I'm glad they pushed because there's some seed going to be in California there was some seed going to be in Arizona some seed in Utah some seed in Oregon some seed in Washington I'm glad you see God's people that really catch the vision of the hour they are always Visionaries among them and they're never satisfied with their little four walls and their little 25 or 30 and their congregation because they believe God is a god of the whole universe and that God's got people around everywhere and he wants to reach them well I don't know about you I still feel the same way today if God wants to reach out my brother Jack better than sitting here and been in some of their most remote parts of the world able to go out and preach the gospel paddle up and downstreams that would scare most of us to death but why would he do it because God ordained him and God gave him the ability and then God gave means financially of people that would be able to support it to carry it out thank God for our American Bill of Rights but let me say oh how grateful I am as a U.S citizen that I have the rights so far that I can stand here today and preach from the dictates of my heart you can sit there and say Amen to it is that right and yet there's many nations around the world that do not have this Liberty today they cannot do it the government will not allow it and yet many of them can be thrown in jail but thank God as for right now we still have these rights and as much as I love them but they would fail in comparison to compare to what the Lord God has given us as his people now not only are we saved and not only are we Sanctified but God has given us a Bill of Rights as we believe being the elect and the bride of Christ that supersedes Beyond just salvation oh how grateful we are for salvation how grateful we are for the power of the blood and the power of the Cross but yet we know it to a real elect member of the body of Christ that the cross is the bridge that takes you across the Gap and the cavern by which the mercy of God opens up as Paul said that there would be an entrance opened up now to many salvation is all they want that's as far as they will ever go will they be saved they will they will come up to the tribulation period they will be purged and the roads will be made clean and white washed of course by the person of the tribulation period but to the elect of God to Abraham's seed Abraham was never satisfied just living over in a poor land the land of the chaldees and the land of Earth and why not stay there why leave and walk all of them hundreds of miles remember he couldn't call an Uber he could not call you all to come and pick him up but the man must walk he must walk through difficulties and trials and tests as you and I must walk this thing will not be easy for us can we say Amen it will not be handed to us on a silver platter but you know what the people of God have never expected spiritual handouts they've never really expected everything to be handed to them on a silver platter but they are willing to fight for it they are willing to face hell they are willing to face opposition and trouble and sad times and resentment they're willing to go for whatever they have to go through in order to stand for Jesus Christ and his word anybody with me today I want you to think now if our father's been led by the spirit of God and you know for many years that they would set a seat there and when they signed the Declaration of Independence and they sent that chair there for who the Unseen guest almighty God oh what a time it was when they prayed what a time it was in our nation whenever they would begin the Congress and so on and so on even have it printed on our money so far in God we trust well for the most of those that that passes through their hand they don't even believe that in the first place because they don't even trust in God what surprised me eventually if they don't try to take it away but you know what that does not change our liberties as the people of God and I hope you understand what I'm fixing to say that really on our side in Christ's providential Army it is the conquered that's really the conquerors it's the conquer hurt that's the real conquerors on Satan's economy it's the conquerors that become the conquered it's the very opposite of what Christ says you see in order for us to be able to conquer in this day we ourselves must be conquered what do you mean brother Donnie we've got to be conquered by Christ himself but those out here in the world politicians preachers churches whatever more that are not conquered by the love of the Lord Jesus and the whole lives and beings given to him they themselves will be conquered by the Great conquer Christ oh I don't want him conquering me that way II Thessalonians tells us in the last day that he will come as a flaming sword will come out of his mouth John Simon Revelation 1 8 and the Sevenfold personage of his glory and there was a great sword as it was coming out of his mouth and with it he will slay the Nations I want to be slave it right now I want my nature my desires anything that's unlike the Lord Jesus anybody understands I want to be conquered by him now but I want to be conquered by his love I don't want to be conquered by his wrath you send the tribulation period Christ The Mighty conqueror will come again and he will conquer but he will not conquer by love but he will conquer by his own judgment and Justice I don't want that myself if you choose that it's up to you but I want the mercy of God so in that the Lord God unlike our founding fathers once the government had been established for a few years and they go from 1776 to 1791 then they begin to realize there were certain things that they left out of the original Constitution and they wanted to make sure because it's like they were learning as they went as our lawmakers still to this very day want to try to bring up amendments I'm not sure if you know it or not but there's actually been hundreds of amendments that comes before our Congress and the body of lawmakers and actually sometimes every year there will be a hundred or more that they will try to add to the Constitution now they still have the power you know to be able to amend the Constitution so they call it an amendment well you know since they have the power and our government is controlled by the devil and control for the most part by wicked men all they've got to do is make another amendment here and an amendment there and they make one and then they override the second one which is your right to bear arms or they'll make another amendment which will override your very first one which is the freedom of speech the freedom of religion come on now church so they have the power to amend to it but I'm so glad that our God didn't have to rethink his amendments I'm so glad that it didn't say well you know why I'm kind of learning a little bit more about these human beings I'm learning a little bit more about this situation so I think I'm kind of going to change my program I'm on how to make it a little bit different because now I realize laodicea is going to be so bad and it's going to be so indifferent I started my church out the way I wanted it but I realized I ain't going to work in the last days I'm going to have to make an amendment to my original clause and to my original Bill of Rights because really I sorted it out to be an Apostolic church I started out to where everybody would have the Holy Ghost but I realized that later to see it's going to be so bad I'm going to have to change all that and I I'm not going to have my sons to be able to preach on wholeness anymore because women won't want to live it and Men won't want to live it and it's going to be so bad and the power of the devil is going to be so strong that I'm just going to have to accept into my kingdom every liar ever drunk every hormone or ever Thief well that's the way a lot of people preach it today that God has lowered his standards God ain't Lord his we lowered ours we'll praise the Lord so with our Bill of Rights then there are guarantees that come with it but there's also of course responsibilities and there's also a knowledge that is required of us so if someone comes against us and the government tries to pursue us and they want to bring uh you know us as before Jerry or court trial or whatever more it would pay us to know our rights you agree with me so what if then the enemy our enemy Satan himself he tries to attack us on our bill of divine rights but yet we don't know what's in it so what's mine well I don't know I mean I'm a Christian so isn't that enough no if that's all you'll know he will exalt what he knows above what you know and he'll take what's rightfully yours away from you so don't you say well you just make common sense for us as the people of God to want to know what is ours so whenever the enemy or may I say the government of Satan wants to come against us now you realize that these things were set up and ratified so that our government would be under control this is why of course it is divided into the three branches instead of having a monarchy like a king So a king was over the money he was over the judicial system he was over a bit of it but our fathers wanted to break it up into three separate dominions or bodies and they would have checks and balances by which they would check out each one so the presidential aspect can only go so far the executive branch Congress controls the prosperous strings and boy they ain't doing a very good job with it are they them strengths is way out of hell and then we've got the judicial side of it so each one of them checks out the other well most of us we just say here today we don't show what our rights are and we're saying well if I ever get trouble I guess I'll Google it I guess I'll look at it I guess I'll do that well you know in the natural sense that might hold you over now hopefully you'll none of you will ever have to look up your Bill of Rights and you'll never be prosecuted in a wrong way but I wonder how many people in America are done so every year framed oh brother Donnie with him in a free Nation free from what look around friends our nation is busted our nation is more divided than it's ever been our nation is at War within itself our enemies perceive it our enemies look at Korea looking around look at China look at what they're doing what's it a sign of a weak leader in the White House and wickedness and among the nation itself my goodness here we go but yet I would like the devil to know as long as I'm here as your pastor I want a group of people here who know their rights as children of God I want you to be able to know that if sickness comes your way that you'll be able to know you have a god-given right to be able to call for the Elders of the church and they can lay hands on you and you will be delivered that if oppression comes your way that you know you have a right I don't have to live this way I don't have to live sad all of my life I don't have to live down depressed and weary I can have joy in the midst of trouble I can be happy even in the middle of the biggest test I've ever been through in my life you know it's the people of God if we do not know our rights Satan will push us around as the prophet said it over and over again that we live so far beneath our god-given privileges he called it and what is a privilege a privilege is a right when it becomes endorsed now you see it's part of our inalienable rights as American citizen now you may not even if you have some type of legal situation you may not be able to even afford an attorney and you couldn't go down there and get some guy in Elizabethton or some in Johnson City but if you cannot afford one in your Bill of Rights there is a provision for you to be able to have legal representation well you see I could not afford an attorney that would go before the presence of almighty God for me I couldn't afford one neither could you that was not enough money there was not enough merits there was nothing I could ever do or you could ever do to be able to get an attorney so the court appointed me one the Divine Court in heaven aborted me an attorney who was it the judge himself became our attorney so he knew we would never be able to have a way to stand against the powers of Darkness so he come to the Earth in order to become our attorney that he could set us free from the bondage of sin praise the Lord and then after that he didn't sit down and stop and say okay now I've saved you all y'all just try to go through life as best you can and you'll struggle here and there and don't call on me because I'm really busy I'm making a lot of streets of gold and I'm making Gates apparel and I got a lot of things to do up here in heaven but you understand the gates of pearl have already been home the streets have gone now according to what the prophet tells us in 1965 before he left the Earth the gates of pearl had already been created streets of gold had already been made and actually the inhabitants of that City the angels of God are awaiting breathlessly for us as the people of God to come into that place so it's not like that he's there still working on the city apparently according to what the prophet saw it must have already been done so it's been done since 1965. praise the Lord and it's been waiting for you and I as the people of God now think whatever the Lord God called us to himself that he wanted to equip us now how many of you kids spent all your school years in the first grade huh I mean some of you wasn't 17 years old and still in the first grade wow well why would we want to do that spiritually why would we want to grow no further in the knowledge of God why would we be totally satisfied and just talking about the blood and we're saved and we're saved and we're saying hey I've been saved most of my life but I need more than that to be able to fight the devil I've got to know my rights somebody help me to know what my rights are what's given to me as a Believer just salvation alone so I hunker down and let the devil kick me and stalk me and treat me like a piece of trash and then I waste your my whole life and I die and I saw off into heaven so that's what salvation done for me salvation purchased me from the devil's hand and then he leaves me on the side of the road as it was being a homeless child of God an aimless child of God a child of God with no motive a child of God with no purpose a child of God but no desire to never move one step further than just getting saved I'm sorry but that's not who I am well no I'm not sorry either I am called of God to venture off my brother Donnie you're an old man you don't have to tell me that I know that already but I'm wondering right now how much more higher Heights there is for me in Christ Jesus I wonder how much more by the Harvard that we can understand by the grace of God anybody with me how many once more you know what that proves there's more for you let us go to some of our rights this morning Matthew chapter 3 verse 11. notice what the Bible says here I indeed John the Baptist baptize you with water into repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I'm not worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and West ashes oh okay so we we don't practice Ash Sunday here we practice fire Sunday fire Wednesday fire Monday in the youth service fire Thursday on the youth service we don't practice ashes we want fire what is Isis it's a sign of World fire was well my grandpa told me how they used to do this and that my mother told me they used to have a move of God but that ain't going to do us no good well I remember boy boy I remember when I was a little boy we used to have a fire we don't believe in Ash Sunday we want fire here at our church now is this our right you answer me is this our right do we want our children to have the same Holy Ghost and Fire that fell on the day of Pentecost or do we want them just to have an ash experience I don't he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire so it's going to be something that's going to baptize you in to a Dynamo of fire that fire was in you will motivate you it will clean you it will keep you all praise the Lord notice Saint John 14 16 I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive now if there's a sinner here in the building today we certainly welcome you to the service and we will offer if you need prayer we'll certainly do that for you that you can receive Christ as your savior but what Jesus is talking about here brother Paul is not that a sinner can come up and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost Jesus said the world cannot receive this but the sinner comes up and receives Christ as safe your repentance and then he's baptized for remission of sin then that makes him a candidate for the right of the indwelling presence of God God will not get in a sinner's heart so the sinner must be saved Sanctified baptized amen and then God wants to come in him now listen he says but ye know him now he tells us why the world cannot receive it too because it sees him not neither know it's him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you which was the Lord Jesus and shall be in you now he's going to change from the son of man form to the Son of God for him which is the spirit Holy Spirit notice I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you so here is our comforter Saint John 16 13. how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into just enough truth to get you saved and then all the rest are true so it won't really matter all truth so every person who truly has the Holy Ghost will have a hunger for Ultras he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come again Acts 2 38. then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost now is this a right [Music] well I'm not sure it's for me now you know what you're allowing you're allowing your enemy to talk you out of your right to the Holy Ghost well I'm not good enough that's not what he said well I've done a lot of things wrong he knew that the first part of that verse covers what you've done wrong the first part of that verse covers being born in sin it covers your lying it covers all that sort of thing and then the first part of the verse opens up a way for the second part of the verse that you can receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you know brother Brown talks about it there tonight actually had the service in 1959 on the Holy Ghost series and he talked about his sister Dolores and how that she went up to pray and pray praying at home and she's telling her brother Brandon about you know when she'd go to pray for the Holy Ghost how she'd get tired if she'd get sleepy or all kinds of things would happen what he said well that's the devil that's the devil trying to stop you now we do not believe we have to come to an altar and tarry as we say all it takes is Us opening our heart and the spirit of God getting everything out of the way and you acknowledging anything that's wrong in your life so the Holy Ghost can fill you how long do I just say there brother Donnie 10 days five days five minutes would be a long time if you really read it you understand it don't take God five minutes to give you the Holy Ghost it don't take him a minute as long as he comes to and expects the boxcar and he sees that everything is laid out of the way and then he fills us with the Holy Ghost pulls the door down slams itself puts the seal on the door and says you're good to go boy you're good to go girlfriend get right on to Heaven you're good all the rest of the journey but yeah I wonder how many of our people sitting here today and they don't feel like they have the Holy Ghost well why well I've tried and I've tried and I've tried I get so discouraged it's your right so what if you stand outside and the police officer stands out aside I'll tell you what you would send their worship and God you ain't allowed to do that well according to who sir according to me I say you can't do it so you're going to say well okay I won't come back to church no more all right well I don't worship no more or are you going to stand there and say you know what our pastor just told us about the ratification of the Bill of Rights I see about American citizen I know what my rights are as a matter of fact if you tell me I can't worship I think I'll turn right around and go back in and just go ahead and scream and holler right now to prove to you I know this is my rights and this is my church and this is my Lord Jesus and it is my time to worship [Music] or would you get in your car and say well that policeman told me I couldn't do it I mean he's a policeman he had a 9mm stuck on his side he had a badge on he had a bulletproof vest he had a fancy cap on top of his head I mean his clothes was just armed decreasing the British leg he out of one of them cop cars there's a real siren and a real horn and everything I don't care how real it is your own Bill of Rights tells you that you have a right to freedom of religion look if you want to believe Humpty Dumpty is God the American Bill of Rights gives you that right you've got it right as an American citizen if you want to preach Humpty Dumpty is coming for you the second time that's up to you a policeman cannot stop you how much more should we as the people of God we're not preaching a bunch of fables we're not preaching a bunch of Disney makeup but we're preaching the word of God that God himself has proven over and over again should not we as the people of God stand shoulder to shoulder and say it is I right to worship God it is our right to live for him it is our right to be the saints of God it is my right to be his bride everybody oh my goodness I wonder how far this promise goes then verse 39. for the promise is unto you and two ah as many even as many as the Lord our God shall call how many of us called by God ah you've got to write to the Holy Ghost but you'll fight discouragement you'll fight weakness you'll fight all kinds of things but you got to keep on hammering and then believe it they will not move out of your way just because you say I've got a promise it's in my Bill of Rights and you think the devil is just going to swoon you think the devil's just going to grab his kerchief and rub his brow and say oh I'm Blown Away they have told me their bride oh demons let's go back to Hell let's just go back down and leave them alone because now that knucklehead preacher stood up there and told them they've got a Bill of Rights and they say now because he's told them they're going to turn hell upside down no we know better than that we know we'll fight to do it but we are going to turn hell upside down we just ain't going to do it in a day but we will do it as a matter of fact I'd like to remind the devil today when he exists no more we will still be shouting and praising God through eternity when there is no more cancer when there is no more sadness or depression when there is no more discouragement you and I will always be in the presence of God but it's because we stood for our rights down here notice women in Ephesians 1 13. in whom you also trusted at you that you heard now watch watch the the Divine protocol of the new birth and whom you also trusted actor that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit promised oh my goodness you mean you didn't get it when you believed you understand that makes the majority of Christian preachers today false subscribe because they teach their people they got it when they believe that's not the way Paul believed it this is all right brother Joel Brown this is our inalienable right to have it just like this that's our young people believe after whoever's here today believes then you have a right to the Holy Ghost it's your inalienable right oh thank God well let me just go ahead and bring down one more I've got time for another one there's one right here that's a very controversial right uh and I understand why because Satan would love to make a mimic of Christ's Church but it's the right to be like the original Church because like begets like so it is our right to have Word of Life Church to be and the pattern of the original church and Acts 2. and they believe it notices from the church age book I know you're familiar Lewis an unchanging God but unchanging ways what he did at the first he will have to keep on doing until it is done for the last time how many believes that so once God ever started in the dispensation of Grace dealing with the first human being out to the Cross then God has to deal with every other human being from that stand of time right there in 33 A.D on up to 2050 2075 21 30 28 90. however far it goes as long as the apostolic age is going on God has to deal with every one of them the exact same way if they are part of his body now if they are a church then that's a different category at all for sure notice this he says oh my when God did it the first time you let's keep on doing until the last time there will read it [Music] though well [Applause] why do message people want to change that's a shame it taught years ago denominations to be the only one that wanted but not anymore a lot of our message folks want to change it which is so sad so surprising really because Satan knows that there's a word that is returned the face back to the original Apostolic fathers you see we must be Tried by that word after we've been restored we could not be faithful bride if we're not or you sound like they're going to say oh I believe it then the Lord Jesus so as soon as every member believes it I'll take him out of here oh no they'll believe it and then they'll be tried to say if they still believe it after the trial well praise the Lord I'm going to be found standing sin I still believe the same thing I still believe now notice there will never be a change apply that to the church ages the kind of man that God chose for the first church age and how God manifested in that man's Ministry would be the example of all other ages what God did in the first church age he wants to do in all other ages and that includes ours now we know exactly from the word which was recorded by the Holy Spirit how the first or the original church was founded how that God manifested himself in her the word can't change or be changed because the word is God [Music] [Applause] thus what the church was at Pentecost is the standard this is the pattern there is no other pattern glorious no matter what the scholars say now on the church age book was written there wasn't heard any message callers but it was all Baptist Methodist Church Christ Church of God and all that sort of say but now we've been around so long with the message that we've got message Scholars now what is a scholar it's a person who studies and studies and applies themselves and studies the word so now we've got message Scholars saying what the denominational Scholars said in 1965. I'll tell you one thing I sure hate to know that was my identification I'm lined up with lining up with denominational preachers well praise the Lord call me Pentecost if you want to I'd rather be called death in church Christ than an anti-word discussed now he says there is no other pattern my mama God so then manifested himself and there's no other pattern God has not changed the pattern what God did at Pentecost says to keep right I don't do until the age is closed though the scholars may tell you the apostolic age is over what don't believe it ah don't believe it such a statement is wrong on two accounts first of all it is wrong to suppose that there aren't any more Apostles just because the original 12 are dead an apostle means a sent one and there are many sent once a day but they're called missionaries as long as men are being called and sent forth with the word of there is an Apostolic age you mean right here today in April 2023 there is an Apostolic age going on how many of us glad to be Apostolic I told my denomination on that I'm talking about original Apostolic Doctrine praise the Lord as long as men are being called and send for us with a Word of Life there is an Apostolic age going on secondly they refer to an age of manifested holy ghost power has been over since the Bible has been completed this is untrue now of course a lot of the message callers they say well you know what God can't do it no more because brother Branham in here oh I guess I didn't realize Hebrews 13 8 was brother Branham I thought Hebrews 13 8 was Jesus my bad I guess huh oh I thought that's what my Bible said here I've been reading the scripture for almost all of my life and I thought my Bible said Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever not William Branham not on the Neville not Paul not Peter not James but Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever notice he said there's not one scripture that suggests but many conclusively state otherwise yours are proof both of these charges are false oh so now he relates to this to being a charge so someone is standing here making a charge like a legal statement so you all if you worship if you sing if you clap your hands and your pastor prays for people and they shout and some of them may even fall out you all are a bunch of Pentecostals and you know Donnie Reagan has always been a Pentecostal it's a matter of fact one of the great leaders of the message years ago said that I was the greatest enemy that the message had I thought no I wouldn't look at you send me the message had I was one of the greatest enemies the devil ever had how many wants to be one of them how many wants to be an enemy to the devil do it oh all your sense because she was in Pentecost oh no let me tell you something if I what I saw in Pentecost that I see some real stuff yes I did but I also saw the office bunch of false stuff it ever was and I don't want none of that I don't want none of that that was off the word but that is only a Satan trying to make a scarecrow to put in front of people and you know as well as I know all it takes is two three people in a church and you watch them get in the flesh a little bit and get out of the way and it will hinder the move of God because others will sit there and say oh no oh no oh no you mean you are going to let somebody with an overzealous desire hinder you from worshiping god brother Donnie have you ever seen people in the flesh yep I sure have I've seen them get in the flesh I've seen them do things they shouldn't have done but the prophet of God said he'd rather have a little bit of wildfire than no fire at all if you've got Wildfire you can't aim it down but if you ain't got nothing but ashes you know what you do when you blow on ashes you blow them away foreign [Applause] well I'd rather not get in the flesh honey I hate to be the one to tell you but you've been in the flesh since the day you took your breath I'm worried about getting out of it not getting in it oh well I'll tell you one thing I've seen some of the people and I've been streaming some of the services here and there and down Lord have mercy them people screaming holding them people down to use Camp they was jumping in a shouting somebody told me they even had speaking in tongues going on down there yeah I was on a block and I do not apologize I do not apologize that God heal the sick I do not apologize that God changed the life of some of those young people I do not apologize that God gave some of them the Holy Ghost I do not apologize that lives were changed or some of them in the flesh yes they were but at least they were worship Him and they didn't think they was in the casket some people come to church and they're like an Egyptian they're mummified any y'all ever seen them mummies up close man you talking about a pitiful deal I don't scan three or four thousand years old laying there oh my goodness standing there holding their scepter or whatever War just laying there like that they ain't gotta move about them at all it reminds me of some of these dead dried Church of God my church members that ain't got no move of the Holy Ghost they ain't fell a chill in 30 years they ain't felt a twitch they ain't felt nothing my goodness inside to the night that God's saved and they want to point their finger at somebody that's trying to do something for God why was somebody who would give me this morning we've got our rights let me tell you something friend on the day of Pentecost the Bible didn't say that they come out of their sitting like this what's that what is that you imagine them looking and said these men are drunk Glory imagine no fits Fritz rather when brother Brown needed a skunk and he come up on that wood pile where that skunk was I know Francis our equivalent and shaking so oh I don't want to do it I don't want to do it you imagine what old Fritz had done by the jacket brother remember looked at him and went French to look back and said is that all you've got labored and fought all hell to bring you a sermon and what you do is sit there or not some of you get wild do this well Glory I don't mind I'll tell you sometimes I feel bad like a dog but I could use a little encouragement every now and then but I don't want you to send me that text when I'm preaching I want you to say go ahead get him come on brother Donald preach I'm with you I'm behind you come on tell the truth preach the word preach Deliverance so my daughter can get the Holy Ghost preach the power of God so my son can get the Holy Ghost so my baby can be healed so this cancer can get out of my body oh Hallelujah it is all right it is all right if you take the word Pentecost out of this message you are taken away from what God's Prophet taught until he stops calling the Pentecostal message and Power say it with me will not cease [Applause] what the church had at Pentecost is her inalienable right [Applause] this is what the word a Navy bill right means and alienable right refers to the rights that cannot be surrendered sold or transferred to someone else Hallelujah I want you to have your blessing but you ain't getting mine well Paul I want you to have yours brother Jim I want you to have yours but you ain't getting mad I'm a little bit selfish when it comes to the blessings of God I want everything that's got my name wrote on it oh praise the Lord I'm not going to go through God's list I don't want to do this I don't want to shout like that I don't want to jerk like that I'll say Lord pour it out or if I need a jerk maybe I need to jerk some of the nonsense out of me if I need to shout maybe I need to kill some of my pride I want everything that's mine now listen this is your right not only it's a church body but as an individual it's a your neighborhood right to refer rights that cannot be surrendered sold or transferred to someone else especially a natural rights such as the right to own property however these rights can be transferred with the consent of the person possessing the rights so Island Haley Bill writes hell cannot take them demons cannot take them the only one that can transfer your inalienable rights well high blood runs in my family I guess I'll go in to go to the doctor and get on high blood pressure medicine my family it's in my DNA my whole family has been bothered by lust I guess I might as well just give in to it give me a smartphone and start surfing the internet and going to this website and that website my grandpa done it my daddy done it my mama done it I guess I'm doomed you just transferred your inaliable rights to the devil euphorfeited you're right to be free from pornography you forfeited your right to be healed you forfeited your right to have peace that passes understanding because you're looking at your family tree or your DNA or your past well I fell so many times I messed up I've done this and other and tell me what has that got to do with your destiny tell me what your past has got to do with your future tell me what your failures has got to do it's a promise of God that lays before you now you keep looking at your past you'll never move beyond your past your past will control you it will haunt you it will produce nothing but a failure but you've got to look at your future you've got to look at your destiny you've got to look at the promise of God as an inalienable right yeah Hallelujah these rights can be transfer so some of y'all was a millionaire and somebody come up and say hey it's office tomorrow I'll sign it over you better not yes sir yes get out I'll come looking for you oh yes sir yes sir of course you didn't get it at the lottery because Christians don't play that oh well I guess apparently some do so that Thief tells you meet me at such and such at 10 o'clock yes sir yes sir I'm gonna get you if you don't yes sir you mean to tell me y'all are gonna do it Lord have mercy some of you wouldn't do it for a dime some of you so tight you squeak whenever you walk there ain't no way in the world you're going to give up a million dollars Lord have mercy and yet you'll give away healing you'll give away peace you'll give away your right to happiness as a child of God you give away your right to a Holy Ghost Field marriage and a holy ghost filled family and a home on this auspense and I believe God wants our homes to be a little touch of Heaven I don't think it's pleasing to God when parents argue I don't think it's facing the God but husbands and wives get into big debates oh oh here we go again and arguing and fussing and fighting you are relinquishing your right to a peaceful home right thank you sir so y'all meeting him at the lawyer's office tomorrow if I was you I'd go to Duncan go through the dresser or go sir Bojangles and get you a ham biscuit or something like that and say let me tell you something to find me that Rascal again I'll tell him if you bother me again I'm calling the cops on you because I go to church with some police Brothers ah you see we ain't just got a promise we bought a power of enforcement that boy may come back to your house the next day that man may knock on your door hey you didn't show up knowing furthermore I ain't done if you don't get out of here I'm calling 9-1-1 on you right now so you see the prophet of God teaches us in the restoration of the Bride Tree in 1962 the there is a power to enforce what God's given us and a lot of that enforcement is going to be based upon your Authority as a believer that you recognize I don't have to bow down with this devil I do not have to give in to this devil I've got a right come on Holy Ghost back up your word back up your word I don't have to deal with this bunch of nonsense huh let's finish this quote can we Hebrews 2 1-4 therefore we ought to give the more Earnest tea to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by Angels would steadfast and every transgression and Disobedience to the word received it just spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him God also bearing them Witness both for signs and wonders and diverse gifts diverse Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his will that original church was not organized by men it was led by the Holy Ghost it wasn't very big it was hated and despised it was oppressed it was persecuted unto death but it was true to God it stayed with the original word pattern because of the unchanging God but unchanging ways we can go back to the beginning and see the first and perfect ACT of God and then judged by that that is your standard brother sister this is how it's done the true church will always try to be like [Music] [Applause] the original at Pentecost the true church of today will try to approximate that early first one oh praise the Lord is there anybody here that believes this you have to work from the original jump down in there about three quarters of the way in there as light begets like the true church will always be the one that tries to follow in the steps of her Founders Act Pentecost and her Messengers will follow the Apostle Paul the first Messenger to the first church age it is as simple and that wonderful it is that simple and that wonderful is it wonderful to you my brothers and sisters I present to you today another portion of your bill of Rights Hallelujah Miss Bauer heads together Lord Jesus we thank you for your word I don't mind saying and being honest it would be much easier if we just said well you know what it's just a lot of trouble and it's a lot of work to kick against the system it's just it just ain't worth it so we compromise here and we compromise there and we say well you know maybe we are a little emotional maybe we are a little upset we just get nervous and getting worked up so maybe we all need to settle down a little bit when we go to church we we don't do no worship we don't do no clapping of our hands and maybe that'll encourage the preacher to go from an hour 15 or hour 20 or whatever it is down to about 10 minutes and we've got this nice big Fellowship Hall on the other side and we'll start having less church time and more basketball time and more Fellowship time and we'll start bringing maybe donuts and coffee so we can all go over there and talk about how much we owe how much we own how much will worse it might be easier on the flesh but Lord we know in the long run that is the way of death our building our facility is not designed with fellowship with one another being the main principle it's fellowship with you and your presence where you can change our lives that first church died animals tore their guts out of them many of them their heads were chopped off they were treated awful slaughtered some said and then Paul quoted it slaughtered his sheep but they held true who are we then to go sliding in and this Carefree age of laodicea wanting to be burden free and trouble-free Lord God I don't I'm not a fool I'm not asking for trouble to come my way but neither am I asking for asking for trouble to come my way but neither am I asking for a flower bed of ease how could I stand up and look at men like Paul how could I stand up Lord and look at those of men how can some of these politicians how could those who are in the White House in Congress and Senate stand before John Quincy Adams Thomas Edison what would those men say about our leaders today that are nothing but compromisers whatever the people want let them have it give it to them oh how our forefathers would roll over their grave as we'd say well what about our forefathers of the face Peter James John Paul what about our own church AIDS messenger how would he feel to walk into churches and a lot of them don't even believe in Preachers no more those many of them that do believe in Preachers don't believe that Jesus is the same I wonder if brother Branham could come and preach a sermon and ever Message Church if he would indict the denominations or indict us help us Lord God help us Lord God we want to be like that true church oh the times have changed if Peter and James would walk in this place today they'd be overwhelmed I'm sure David walk in brother Tim's Church many churches around the world that have their own building on their own property they would no doubt say what is all this stuff they'd see them screams and the words there look at these instruments and say what's that big long black thing oh Paul that's a piano what's that other thing it's it's an organ what's them things are beaten on there's drums what's that thing with them six strings it's a guitar but I hope they would be one thing they would identify with are preaching our Saints living right dressing right saying Amen to the word no doubt Paul might in one way feel uncomfortable being in a church this size and among this many people since at the Crete Corinthian Church and the church at Ephesus average would run between 12 and 20. they might feel uncomfortable getting up here to stand before all these people today but I hope it feels so comfortable looking out there and preaching about the deity of Christ and send these young people raised in their hands and saying praise God I hope you look around at some of us in our 40s 56s in one of them more and we would react the same way the Holy Ghost fell on them there at the upper coast of Ephesus when he went there and said how are you all baptized I said oh John baptized this he said that won't work in this day you got to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when he baptized them then laid hands on them they were filled with the Holy Ghost I hope Paul would feel so comfortable that he could say you know you've gone people here today any of you older people need the Holy Ghost and Paul could lay his hands on him and watch the Holy Ghost fall on and refresh like it did two thousand years ago that's the kind of church we want Lord hallelujah we're not looking for some spot in the Johnson City Press new church built look at the fancy pictures look at the pretty lights look at this we don't care if our picture ever gets in the newspaper we don't care Lord God if anybody thinks it's the most beautiful building what difference does that make to us we wanted to be a place where the Holy Ghost is welcome we want it to be a place for the angels of God can come down and walk among us Lord oh Jesus it's our right our inalienable right I for one will fight for it I will fight hell I will fight false Doctrine give me strength give me wisdom give me courage Lord Hallelujah how many would raise your hand with me here today and say Lord let me stand I may not be a preacher but Lord let me stand behind the men of God that are fine I'll swear allegiance to Jesus Christ I pledge my allegiance to the Lamb of God Hallelujah I will stand and forfeit my rights to be a laodicean I will forfeit my rights to dressing acting and behaving like the world I will pledge my allegiance to the Lamb of God Lord help me as long as I can as an American citizen I was never able to serve in our armed services yet many of our people have Lord may I say to them I thank them today not only those that are alive but those who gave and paid the ultimate sacrifice they gave their life yet many of them lived but they come home scarred for life trauma all kinds of things they still deal with to this day Lord we give credit to those today for doing that not only those who fought in our armed services but Lord God those men of God that have fought for the truth how we long to stand there and Shake Luther's hand Wesley's hand knocks Calvin many of those men at that day that stood there father to Proclaim what truth they had so we'd be able to stand here today and say that we are a people who have a restored face we worship you Lord Jesus what about our children are we willing to stand beside Paul and Luther and Wesley and Knox and many of those men that gave their lives for the cause oh my I want to be something when we stand there that day and the people of this age will stand there with the prophet of God of our age and he will present us as trophies of his ministry to the Lord Jesus Christ oh praise God you'll be so glad there that you stood for your rights now the Lord Jesus will stand and say to us children well done you stood for me now I will stand for you praise the Lord praise the Lord thank you Lord Jesus how many has a need today in your heart your home your life physical spiritual Financial whatever it is oh praise the Lord Jesus We Worship You Lord I'm on all for prayer for you but it doesn't mean that that thing will totally leave you now keep in mind when it may leave you right now but it doesn't mean it won't try to come back on you and aggravate you but you've been taught your rights Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord God I bring my people before you you see their needs Lord it's our inalienable rights when the devil attacks us and we're in the line of duty to be healed Lord I pray for the sick right now Dear God I pray for Michael Carter Lord yourself brother having a real battle in his body the Lord tried to take the chemo a couple of times and working against him not even strong enough to be able to come to church May the spirit of God move for

take your hands off of these people father there's many more that I haven't mentioned my name but that's the ones that come to my mind but right now Lord in this building no doubt there's many many that have requests on their hearts We join our hearts together now father on the promise of your word in the name of Jesus May the angels of the Lord pass through this building today bring healing bring Deliverance bring peace Lord if there's some without the Holy Ghost may it stick to them right now it's in my Bill of Rights I've repented I've been baptized I've got a right to be filled with the Holy Ghost I've got a right to be healed I've got a right to be delivered I've got a right to peace I've got a right to worship my god I've got a right to be able to stand for him in this last day I've got to write to the resurrection or the Rapture whichever his will ordain soon for me to be in and there ain't nothing going to stop me from being there it's my church this is my pastor this is my message these are my family and there ain't enough devils in Hell going to run me off from here come on Saints you know as well as I know and when you find your position the devil will do everything he can to discourage you from coming to the house of God well people don't love me and nobody knows my name well you know what you got to press through that thing and say you know what I ain't going because people know my name I'm going to lift my voice in the presence of the king I'm going to let the devil know and all the people know whose side I belong on Hallelujah we worship you today Lord it is our inalienable rights and the only way we've heard it today that the devil can take it from us is if we let him have it oh God may we make a commitment to Daylight never before we will never give up we will never sign over our property to the devil we will never give up our rights we will fight to the last day till we breathe our life's breath granted father I pray in the name of Jesus oh Hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord what do you say we exercise our god-given rights to lift up holy hands without wraths and doubting praise ye the Lord let everything that has breaths praise ye the Lord let the little children praise the Lord let the teenagers praise the Lord let all the rest of us praise the Lord it is our right it's not only our right it is our honor them hands that used to hold beer and cigarettes and all types of filths of the world but now they're holy hands because they're cleansed by the fire of God so we can raise our hands in the presence of the king and say Lord we worship you this morning we bless your name you're our healer your our deliverer your almighty God oh praise the Lord anybody want to help me Praise Him for just a little bit before we go oh Jesus we worship you father let's sing a little something hey can we just worship him a bit I know we gotta we got a memorial service later this evening precious a little bit for time but I believe we've got time to be able to Worship the Lord a little before we go remember Jesus said his house will be called a house of prayer is that right but we know it's also a place that there the prophet said for God and his people are worshiped together God and his people are worse you said what worship together what do you mean by that statement Brother Don it's quite simple if you understand what worship is you see it used to be in the wedding vows and the ancient English wedding vows by which some of your great-grandparents and maybe even some of your grandparents were married by with thee my body I the worship so the mate making it by The Vow when they would stand there they was giving their body to their husband or wife and there you understand what God does God comes Among Us and God gives us of his own body word and he's saying my bride this is me take of me learn of me take me this is who I am and this is who I want you to be and God's saying I'm giving myself to you this is what worship is it's not just screaming and hollering God ain't raising his hands to you God is Not bowing giving you obeisance that's not all worship is but worship is sure raising your hands and praising him but worship is you saying with my body I the worship not only on Sunday morning but tomorrow next day and next day and next day and you keep him before you and it helps you to not do things that you ought not do because you realize your body Belongs to the Lord your body is the temple of God so with your body you worship almighty God he turns right back around and what does he do pulls his bride up close to him he says sweetheart I love you you're mine I bought you I'll ordain you I called you you understand what he's doing he is relating to you and cooing and making love to you oh my can we just take a few moments now brother Branham after being down at brother Charlie Cox's house in 1956 and brother Charlie showed me the power line where this happened there was a driveway that pulled right up in brother Charlie's house and there was a power line that was right over the top of that driveway and brother Branham had seen two doves two turtle doves and they were sitting out there on that power line and they had their little necks wrapped around one another brother random had been down there in 1956 so he goes to Brooklyn New York and he also comes back to Jeffersonville and he begins to preach about them doves and they were sitting there on them lines he said making love to one another and he said how God searches for cold starchy hearts that he can be able to make love to that God wants to come and break that old hardness about us and break that old starchy Cole sing about us and God take his neck and wrap around ours and cool to you brother Charlie said them little doves had sat there and the male would cool and the little female would sit there and say no she didn't do that but you know what she done cool so the male would coo and shuku back well I don't know how what you think about this service today but I think he's been cooing to us what do you say we go back let's wrap our neck around his just take a few minutes before we go and sing just worshiping I'm not asking you to run jump scream holler shout jump over the pews turn the seats down backwards just wrap your neck around here Jesus I love you have I told you today how much you mean to me a couple months me and Carol will be married for 50 years but you know what I still tell her you're the most special person I counseled a young couple last Sunday Carol was in North Richmond I looked over to him and told him one of the most important things about marriage is learning to communicate to be able to keep that harness together even when you're facing difficult times and I said there ain't nobody in the world I would rather spend the rest of my life with I have absolutely this many regrets for marrying her as a 16 year old girl and I would marry her again if I was 16. why I love her but you know what I just didn't tell her that when we got married a man and woman driving down the road and they've been married for a long long time and things got a little tough between them and she said you realize you ain't told me that you loved me in a long time and said I told you I loved you one moment when I married you if it changes I'll let you know that's about the way a lot of folks feel about Jesus well I told him I loved him when I got saved how many more times does he want to hear it what about 85 trillion he wants to hear it every day of your life he wants to hear it all through the day all during the day oh my Lord I love you but I told you today I love you have I told you today how much I appreciate you or let's just worship him
