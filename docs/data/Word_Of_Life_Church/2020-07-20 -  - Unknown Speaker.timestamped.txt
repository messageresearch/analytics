[4:57] other side that coming against us Lord
[5:00] it's nothing to you
[5:01] we've got testimonies living testimony
[5:04] standing among us right now Lord that
[5:06] your power is greater than anything
[5:07] Satan is God Lord we believe that not

[5:13] Bride of Christ on earth today Lord
[5:15] these these prayer requests have have
[5:17] been given to us and we've been given
[5:20] the task of carrying them before you and
[5:21] Lord who better could we give them to
[5:23] than the author of life the one and only
[5:27] true Living God who who cares about
[5:29] everything we're going through Lord we
[5:31] know that we have to go through and
[5:33] suffer through some things in this world
[5:34] Lord but it's not alone it's never alone
[5:37] and Lord you suffer through each one of
[5:40] them with us and sometimes we face these
[5:43] trials maybe because you're allowing us
[5:45] to see you a little closer to suffer
[5:47] with you Lord sometimes you you have a
[5:50] communion with us that we don't really
[5:52] fully understand yet on this side Lord
[5:54] but but these pains and these terrible
[5:56] things that we face Lord sometimes it's
[5:58] you revealing yourself to us it's a
[6:01] pathway to you Lord if we just see it

[6:25] yourself to us in a mighty way Lord we

[22:34] Sanji
[22:35] [Music]
[22:49] his
[22:51] till the snow
[23:07] hey aren't you glad he's so mindful of
[23:12] us I'll tell you sometimes it's hard to
[23:15] keep your eyes or out on him somebody
[23:18] sent me a picture today by the wrong
[23:20] Spencer it was it was the Lord Jesus and
[23:25] he was in the midst of the sea and he
[23:28] was standing there in the midst of the
[23:29] sea and lightning and clouds and waves
[23:33] and the billows and the artists had did
[23:37] it in a very very good way and said
[23:42] don't keep your eyes on the storm but
[23:44] keep your eyes on me but it was amazing
[23:46] to look at it and how your eyes would
[23:50] tend to go toward the water and your
[23:52] eyes would tend to go toward the clouds
[23:55] your eyes would tend to go toward the
[23:58] storm but there he was right in the
[24:00] middle of it they answer and you can see
[24:03] in life it can certainly be that way the
[24:06] things that would go through the age
[24:08] that we're living their time that we're
[24:09] dealing with all the things that around
[24:11] us every day of her life
[24:13] humanly will gravitate right toward them
[24:16] clouds and those billows of the sea and
[24:18] my the abyss and the darkness and the
[24:21] depth and the uncertainty and the
[24:24] unknown that's what gets us as human
[24:26] sometimes it's just the uncertainty of
[24:28] things and the unknown but I'm grateful
[24:31] I don't know what the future holds but I
[24:34] know who holds a
[24:36] the same one who holds that as hold in
[24:39] our hand god bless you let's turn to
[24:41] Hebrews chapter 4 - now I greet you in
[24:43] the name of the Lord Jesus certain nice
[24:45] to see y'all again trust you you're
[24:48] doing well during this difficult times
[24:50] and hard times hopefully it won't be too
[24:55] much longer we can all gather together
[24:58] again and we won't be segregated I
[25:01] thought that was illegal Cova changed a
[25:05] lot of things that knit I'm just
[25:07] grateful we can meet together though I'm
[25:09] just so grateful we're not having to
[25:11] meet I appreciate all these musicians
[25:13] but I'm glad to see y'all smile and
[25:15] faces well sometimes you frown but for
[25:17] the most part I'm glad to see your faces
[25:19] out there it really makes us it makes a
[25:22] difference also I want to share
[25:24] something with you that I've got a phone
[25:26] call from brother Randy get some dinner
[25:28] on Monday and he was just really happy
[25:32] and elated and crying and rejoicing
[25:35] because he had just come from a doctor
[25:37] and as you know brother Randy's been
[25:40] dealing with some serious things in his
[25:42] body and they've been treating him with
[25:44] chemo a couple places in his body and
[25:46] the doctor had done scan on him and one
[25:50] one one of the places was a significant
[25:54] difference reduction in the size and the
[25:56] other one was good as well and they were
[25:58] just so happy and so pleased and so
[26:01] actually going to extend it and give him
[26:03] a couple more treatments and we rejoice
[26:05] no I am more grateful so we just want to
[26:08] remember
[26:14] amen hebrews chapter 4 verse 14 seeing
[26:21] then that we have a great high priest
[26:31] this term was never used in the entirety
[26:36] of the Old Testament
[26:38] no Levite can be called this no son of
[26:42] Aaron could be called this we have a
[26:46] great high priest that is passed in to
[26:52] the heavens now Paul wants to make sure
[26:56] that the Saints then the Saints down
[26:58] through the ages and us as well
[27:01] that we understand what passed into the
[27:05] heavens it was not a theophany only it
[27:11] was not deity only but it was to some
[27:16] what he said Jesus the Son of God which
[27:21] is the resurrected created human body of
[27:25] God that has now been elevated into the
[27:29] office of the great high priest seeing
[27:33] then we have a great high priest that is
[27:36] passed into the heavens Jesus the Son of
[27:40] God let us hold fast our profession oh I
[27:49] see so we needed that kind of a
[27:54] foundation to help us hold on to our
[27:59] profession I noticed the way links this
[28:03] seeing then that we have a great high
[28:05] priest that is passed into the heavens
[28:08] Jesus the Son of God let us hold fast
[28:15] our profession so apparently we can't
[28:20] lose it
[28:22] praise the Lord I remember your
[28:24] profession is not your salvation but
[28:28] it's what you confess and what you
[28:31] believe notice this in verse 15 for they
[28:35] have not an High Priest which cannot be
[28:37] touched with the feeling of our
[28:39] infirmities but was in all points
[28:41] everybody believes that all points all
[28:44] points tempted like as we are yet
[28:48] without sin let us therefore come boldly
[28:54] unto the throne of grace that we may
[28:59] obtain mercy and find grace to help in
[29:09] time of need that is therefore come
[29:16] boldly unto the throne of grace that we
[29:19] may obtain mercy in talking to people
[29:22] that are lost a sinner can't come boldly
[29:26] to the throne of God now we're talking
[29:30] about saints but sometimes Saints need a
[29:33] bold assurance let us therefore come
[29:37] boldly unto the throne of grace that we
[29:41] may obtain mercy not salvation not
[29:45] forgiveness of our sins when I tell my
[29:46] becoming renewed now but compassion the
[29:51] word means compassion an open heart from
[29:55] the Almighty that we can obtain mercy
[29:58] and find grace to help in time of need
[30:07] there's anybody there tonight time of
[30:10] need let's bow our heads together
[30:17] Lord Jesus I imagine it would be hard
[30:22] for us to even know how many times this
[30:27] scripture has been read for over 2,000
[30:32] years since Paul was inspired to write
[30:36] it down
[30:37] how many Saints going through such hard
[30:42] times read it they were inspired labor
[30:48] uplifted they were helped they were
[30:51] encouraged here we are at the end of
[30:55] time and we are reading it again tonight
[31:00] and we are blessed we are encouraged and
[31:05] we are helped because we are living in a
[31:09] time of great need but Lord Jesus we
[31:14] believe what you anointed your prophet
[31:17] to say that we can have boldness so that
[31:22] we could come to you to the throne of
[31:25] grace and find Mercy that would help us
[31:31] in the time of need father we bring our
[31:36] needs our petitions our requests before
[31:40] not the judgment throne but the throne
[31:44] of grace and mercy we are so grateful
[31:48] tonight first of all that we can call
[31:51] you Papa that we can say you're our
[31:54] father then to know that you love us so
[31:57] much Lord that you're mindful of us so
[32:01] we bring our needs and petitions before
[32:03] you ask you to be mindful help me that I
[32:06] can get out of the way too now father
[32:09] that you can speak through me I need
[32:11] your help Lord granted I pray father in
[32:15] Jesus name and the Saints said
[32:19] god bless you may be seated
[32:23] I marvel when I look at what our Lord
[32:31] Jesus has done for us in the act of
[32:36] canosa sub emptying himself out and
[32:41] stripping himself down making himself of
[32:47] no reputation stripping himself of
[32:53] omnipotence omniscience omnipresence all
[33:00] the things that he laid aside that we
[33:05] might be helped in the time of need to
[33:10] do all that within itself to me as
[33:12] phenomenal but once he makes this great
[33:17] surrender and sacrifice then he wants to
[33:24] partnership man in all of his falls and
[33:28] all of his weaknesses and all of his
[33:32] shortcomings and make it so that the
[33:36] blessings of God the power of God even
[33:41] the fullness of the redemption of God
[33:45] will be God and man partner shipping
[33:50] together now synced enou matter how much
[33:54] God wants to save the world tonight he
[34:01] cannot and will not if they don't want
[34:05] to be saved now according to the
[34:08] scripture it's not his will that any
[34:11] should perish right so does that mean
[34:15] everybody will be saved no because he
[34:19] will allow man's will to actually so
[34:24] coincide with the will of God that God
[34:28] would say if I would
[34:31] my own will I would save everyone
[34:36] whether they wanted to be saved or not
[34:38] I'm gonna save him because I don't want
[34:42] anyone to be lost but to be just he says
[34:47] I will leave man
[34:49] on the grounds that are placed Adam I'm
[34:53] instead of me forcing my sovereign will
[34:57] on man I will let man choose so a man
[35:03] does not wish to be saved
[35:05] I will not save him against his will now
[35:10] to me that's wonderful that's phenomenal
[35:14] and it shows the justice of God
[35:17] coinciding with the sovereignty of God
[35:20] but now let's bring it on down
[35:22] to the category of the elect that God
[35:26] still leaves us a choice of course our
[35:30] biggest mistakes in life are based on
[35:34] error free moral agency oh we love it so
[35:38] much and we're so proud of it when
[35:40] you're gonna realize it's your enemy
[35:43] you're free moral agency is what got you
[35:46] in the mists you're in tonight but yet
[35:49] God leaves it there but God not only
[35:53] works that in partnerships that into his
[35:57] sovereign will but God also partnerships
[36:02] the administration of grace that will be
[36:07] ministered to the Saints of God through
[36:10] the Melchizedek Priesthood from the
[36:14] throne of grace through the mediatorial
[36:17] work of the son of God down through his
[36:21] people into the church ages and it will
[36:25] not be that God will just sovereignly
[36:27] throw out all kinds of blessings and all
[36:30] kinds of good things and you and I are
[36:33] saying I don't want
[36:34] I don't yeah I'm gonna throw them on you
[36:36] anyhow Harris joined your speech I don't
[36:39] want to piss I'd rather be depressed I'd
[36:41] rather be sad I know you're not gonna be
[36:44] sad you're one of our young ones but
[36:46] that's sad technology of your face I
[36:48] want to make you smile I don't want to
[36:50] go to church I don't care I'm gonna make
[36:52] you go to church it doesn't even do that
[36:56] to us
[36:59] praise the Lord
[37:00] which is sad really because it means
[37:03] that we could be a lot further up in the
[37:06] presence of God if it wasn't for our
[37:09] laziness a lot of times our
[37:11] irresponsibility and so on but notice
[37:15] now how Paul ties the millet oriole work
[37:20] of the Lord Jesus still being as the Son
[37:24] of God and remember son of God is not
[37:25] another God not another being but it is
[37:29] the same God and a condon sended form
[37:32] that would be able to relate to man now
[37:36] let me bring it to you this way early
[37:39] one morning this week as the Lord woke
[37:42] me up and begin to deal with my heart
[37:46] and I was thinking about where we are
[37:51] you know let's ask Ovid and all of that
[37:53] and people lying mask to work and to
[37:57] church and to Walmart and this and that
[38:00] and the other and Carol and I had went
[38:03] to a store yesterday a couple of them
[38:05] actually and they had a sign on the door
[38:08] that no admittance without a mask and if
[38:14] you didn't have one they actually had
[38:16] somebody standing there that would give
[38:19] you one and when I read that I know it
[38:22] may seem peculiar to you but when I read
[38:24] that on the door the Spirit of God spoke
[38:28] to my heart and said that's the way I
[38:32] was without a mask I could not have had
[38:39] admittance into the realm of humanity
[38:45] so he masks himself now think of it he
[38:49] wore a mask so you and I would not be
[38:54] killed if he had not veiled or Mass
[39:01] himself it would have killed us so he
[39:07] put on a mask in order to protect us and
[39:12] also in order to protect himself because
[39:16] had he come to the earth I said eternal
[39:20] and that eternal realm my goodness if he
[39:22] would come in this building tonight and
[39:25] that room of the eternal there's not one
[39:28] of us that would be left alive after 10
[39:31] seconds because our mortality our
[39:34] mistakes our humanity our shortcomings
[39:36] Allen said that God still deals with us
[39:39] and all of our human nonsense
[39:42] the mask the mass values him Oh
[39:46] hallelujah it values him but it's
[39:49] two-sided it protects you and it
[39:52] protects him praise be to God remember
[39:57] when Moses went up on the mountain and
[39:59] received the law of God and when Moses
[40:03] was in the presence of God it was a
[40:05] great display of splendor but when Moses
[40:09] come down from the presence of God and
[40:11] began to speak to the people the Bible
[40:14] says that he put a veil which John Gill
[40:16] says that word in the Hebrew is actually
[40:19] a mask so Moses put a mask over his face
[40:28] when he talked to the people and then
[40:32] when he talked to God he took the mask
[40:35] off so masking altogether altogether
[40:39] totally bad huh so when Moses would go
[40:43] back in the presence of God it
[40:45] move it won't even come by to relate
[40:48] more word he would put the mask on
[40:51] because the word glory there I mean the
[40:54] shown the words shown actually it's the
[40:56] same a group the hebrew word by the root
[40:59] word that come from the word horned hor
[41:02] any D this is why Michael engine or if
[41:05] you look at the great sculptor that
[41:06] Michelangelo has two tiny projections
[41:09] upon the head here of Moses and it looks
[41:13] like horns because the Hebrew word there
[41:17] was horned so they thought somehow that
[41:20] it was that horn which meant protection
[41:23] but when Moses was there the mass was
[41:27] standing between him or the veil between
[41:30] him and the people now saying the Lord
[41:35] God and all that he has done for us and
[41:38] yet all that he wants to give us and
[41:41] he's so limited but what he can reveal
[41:45] because he partnership himself was us
[41:49] and such simple steps that allows him to
[41:54] unveil all of his glory is a B and C now
[42:08] this is not algebra but it will lead to
[42:10] algebra you see to believe the Lord
[42:14] you've got to have here a B C's and it's
[42:21] something that you'll never lose as long
[42:24] as you have pertinent faith and he's
[42:26] word what's this again in Hebrews 4:14
[42:30] sing man that we have a great high
[42:32] priest that is passed into the heavens
[42:35] Jesus the Son of God let us hold let us
[42:41] hold look at the meaning of this word to
[42:45] have power be powerful to be chief the
[42:51] master of to rule get possession of
[42:56] to keep carefully and faithfully
[43:00] continue to hold to retain to hold and
[43:06] check wow what a powerful little small
[43:09] word to hold in check or restrain now
[43:15] this is what when you're supposed to do
[43:18] remember the Lord God will not do this
[43:21] for us so we have this great High Priest
[43:26] which is entered into heaven Jesus the
[43:31] Son of God a high priests which can be
[43:34] touched by the feeling of our
[43:36] infirmities conquered deaths hail the
[43:40] grave sickness disease ever demon and
[43:44] all that he wants to do for us is going
[43:48] to be correlated together and what we as
[43:52] his people will allow him to work in our
[43:55] lives and it's going to be based on a B
[44:01] C what's this Jesus the Son of God let
[44:06] us hold I keep this word in mine how
[44:09] power be powerful be cheap be master of
[44:12] so this is what he wants you to be the
[44:15] master of our profession which means
[44:21] confession subjectively only profess to
[44:26] be ours what one professes or confesses
[44:32] so you mean the greatness of God the
[44:37] miracles the healing the deliverance the
[44:40] many things that God wants to do for us
[44:43] it's not gonna be based on well our
[44:47] praising God didn't do it I cried on how
[44:49] long I begged and I begged and I begged
[44:52] God that don't misunderstand me he is
[44:56] not the high priest of you begging
[45:01] I don't mind telling your friends we are
[45:03] not beggars we are children and Satan
[45:08] tries his best especially in the time of
[45:10] dilemma and emergency to lower our
[45:14] standing before the presence of God and
[45:18] convince us somehow we will get more
[45:22] from God if we act like a bunch of
[45:26] beggars well I'm not worthy I'm no good
[45:30] on no account and where does the Bible
[45:33] say that about you somebody stand and
[45:35] tell me if there was ever a time that we
[45:39] need to hold our profession it's the
[45:44] hour we're living right now and the
[45:46] church said
[45:47] notice again Hebrews chapter 3 verse 1
[45:49] wherefore holy brethren partakers of the
[45:52] heavenly calling consider the Apostle
[45:55] and high priest of the miracles of God
[46:02] the power of God the wonder of God the
[46:04] resurrection of God the healing of God
[46:06] the Apostle and the high priest of our
[46:10] profession you mean the Lord Jesus is
[46:12] the Apostle and the high priest of what
[46:16] I say about Who I am ma consider the
[46:25] Apostle and high priest of our
[46:27] profession Christ Jesus notice Hebrews
[46:32] 10:23 let us hold fast the profession of
[46:37] our faith without wavering for he is
[46:43] faithful that promise I'm sure glad he
[46:48] didn't say we are because that would
[46:49] leave me out and I'll go ahead and say
[46:52] it for the rest of you y'all been left
[46:54] out too so Paul didn't say we were
[46:56] faithful but he said he was but notice
[47:00] this man above all the others in the New
[47:04] Testament would use this word and
[47:07] frame it's similar I said in the chapter
[47:10] four let us hold fast the profession of
[47:13] our faith wonder why wonder why it would
[47:18] be so important for us to hold it fast
[47:21] to be the master to control it to be
[47:25] steady
[47:26] apparently there's going to be a lot of
[47:28] things that's going to try to alter or
[47:32] subdue or change our profession praise
[47:38] the Lord
[47:38] now we know that he can only work
[47:42] according to the allocation of his word
[47:46] given to us and the dispensation that
[47:49] were in now as I said it's going to be
[47:52] based upon a B and C and God will be
[47:59] released when we follow a we follow B
[48:04] and we follow see y'all want me to say
[48:11] an Archie notices the Prophet said Jesus
[48:16] died to heal us every one of you is
[48:19] healed every one of you is healed right
[48:25] now Jesus has already healed you you
[48:30] have to confess it and believe it that's
[48:35] right by stripes you were passed since
[48:37] healed then when he did it at Calvary
[48:39] that's when he overcome all sickness and
[48:44] sin and all a calorie for you just like
[48:48] a table it's set there oh my only thing
[48:53] you have to do is go eat now here is a B
[49:00] C you've got to a accept it B believe it
[49:08] Loreena God in your heart and C confess
[49:13] it
[49:14] and he's the high priest of your
[49:18] confession so then when we say things
[49:22] that are not the word while I'm not sure
[49:25] if God wants to heal me I'm not very
[49:27] good I don't have very much faith to
[49:29] prophet seven you say that you're
[49:30] talking this devil's language he said
[49:32] even if I didn't have very much faith I
[49:35] wouldn't say it I wouldn't let the devil
[49:37] know it
[49:39] let your testimony said always be
[49:42] positive now you imagine them when we
[49:44] say those things the Lord Jesus cannot
[49:48] be the high priest to administer to us
[49:51] the things we need when our confession
[49:54] does not match his word so he says we're
[49:59] blessed and we say oh if it wasn't for
[50:02] bad luck I wouldn't have no luck at all
[50:05] God loves everybody but me God don't
[50:08] bless me God don't care for me then the
[50:11] Lord Jesus has to remain silent on your
[50:14] petition because you're not saying what
[50:16] he's already said about you praise the
[50:19] Lord so you have to a accept it be
[50:23] believe it and your heart and confess it
[50:27] and here's the high priest of your
[50:30] confession now you mean that God would
[50:33] so coincide his very hearts desire to
[50:36] minister to his children all the great
[50:39] things that he purchased based upon them
[50:42] yes why would he do that because he
[50:45] wants us to share the kingdom not only
[50:48] in the Millennium he not only wants us
[50:51] to share the throne or whenever we get
[50:53] way under someone when they've all got
[50:55] new bodies and were changed but he wants
[50:57] to us to share now with him in the
[51:00] allocation of the power of God for the
[51:04] age that we live in you see the word
[51:05] itself it's more than
[51:08] now the logo says the written word
[51:09] demons have access to that written word
[51:12] they can quote it all the time but there
[51:14] is another aspect of the word and we
[51:17] know it is called Rhema two words that
[51:19] are used in the Greek New Testament for
[51:21] the English word word but yet we know
[51:23] they have two totally different meanings
[51:25] and Rhema actually means the word spoken
[51:28] with a living voice the Lobos word is
[51:31] that which we quote and we quote and we
[51:33] quote and we quote and we quote and we
[51:35] quote it many times and it does not
[51:37] happen because we're quoting the logos
[51:40] but if God if you're ever believe have
[51:42] been savor along you that it's happened
[51:44] to you that God will drop something in
[51:46] your heart and you knew it was gonna
[51:49] happen it didn't mean whatever's what
[51:50] nobody said that's a Rhema word and when
[51:54] that happens remember if God had not
[51:57] separated the word and took all the
[51:59] power and the anointing and separated
[52:02] from the letter of the word then Satan
[52:04] would have had total access to the
[52:06] complete power of God by quoting the
[52:09] logos so Satan can say it's written it's
[52:12] written it's written it's written he can
[52:14] quote that Bible bit and any preacher
[52:15] you ever heard in your life but he's
[52:17] never had access to the power the lays
[52:20] in the word because God connected power
[52:24] with word under the category of Rhema
[52:27] word and many times this is where our
[52:30] faith will be tried it's generally not
[52:32] tried so it's on the Rhema aspect as it
[52:35] is the logo says fit because the logos
[52:38] when we're going through trials and
[52:40] tests what is it my God dropped that
[52:42] Rhema there well you've never even got
[52:44] your I'd ever trial you ever faced you'd
[52:46] go right through it
[52:47] but God allows us to be tested on the
[52:50] logos aspect of the word because that's
[52:52] the part that many times we're tried by
[52:54] with no anointing no emotion OMA or
[52:57] don't feel like jumping over a wall you
[52:59] know leaping through great battles and
[53:01] all that sort of thing when the rainbow
[53:03] drops down on your heart if it's happy
[53:04] ever happen to you you know what I'm
[53:06] talking about whenever it drops Aaron
[53:08] your heart my you go looking for the
[53:10] devil you ain't waiting for the devil
[53:11] come looking for you you go looking for
[53:13] him because it release
[53:15] an element of the supernatural power of
[53:18] God in lasat divine promise for you a
[53:22] mantis all right now watch since so God
[53:25] wants us to be able to take an ounce
[53:28] about wonder the donít want he do it all
[53:30] that way by Rhema power because that's
[53:32] not his design in his plan his plan was
[53:35] to allow us children to break into both
[53:37] realms of that word but really the
[53:39] trying aspect it's not so much in the
[53:41] Rhema world in the Rhema world it is so
[53:44] live so powerful so real it's a
[53:46] revelation from God
[53:47] oh my let people leave left and right
[53:49] from the message of the hour if this
[53:51] word has been revealed to you I don't
[53:53] care what they say I don't care what
[53:55] they do I don't care whatever they bring
[53:57] up it won't make a bit of difference to
[53:59] you because you are a believer and this
[54:02] is more than doctrine this is more than
[54:05] just well I need a newspaper article all
[54:07] I need this to prove I don't need none
[54:09] of them come on sage say man why because
[54:12] it has been revealed to me this message
[54:16] to me is not a bunch of doctrines it is
[54:18] not a bunch of statements that we argue
[54:20] about this message has done something to
[54:22] me that Pentecost could never do for me
[54:25] and that is it help me to fall in love
[54:27] with the Lord Jesus more than I loved
[54:30] him in my life but yet in order for me
[54:36] to be able to tap into the presence of
[54:38] God and you to tap into the presence of
[54:40] God there's three aspects about which it
[54:43] will be released and that is the ABCs of
[54:46] the believer
[54:46] notice again I suppose of the Moses
[54:49] remember I want you to listen friends
[54:50] how powerful this is he can never do
[54:53] nothing nothing for you until first you
[55:03] say now think of it the Lord Jesus and
[55:10] all that he purchased and all the great
[55:13] things that have been bought for us and
[55:15] he cannot do anything anything for us
[55:20] until we first say it
[55:27] we need to spend more time saying the
[55:29] route things don't most of us run off
[55:32] our big fat blabbermouth of all kinds of
[55:35] foolish nonsense and no stupid stuff
[55:37] when we ought to be quoting the word
[55:41] well hallelujah you talk more about
[55:44] Jesus and say to your favorite football
[55:46] team or your favorite soccer team or
[55:48] basketball team or this and that and the
[55:51] other and talk about that word
[55:52] I guarantee we'd be a whole lot further
[55:54] up the road well priests mother Dottie
[55:57] notice remember he can never do nothing
[56:00] for you until first you say he's done it
[56:05] believe him and accept it and testify do
[56:08] you know that he's the high priest of
[56:11] what confession Hebrews 3:1 now a
[56:14] setting at the right hand of the Father
[56:16] to make intercession upon our confession
[56:21] that remember he's not interceding on
[56:23] the blood he's not interceding on his
[56:27] righteousness he's not interceding even
[56:31] on his own desire on his own will on his
[56:36] own program he's interceding on our
[56:41] confession and in a wonder that we get
[56:44] so many of our prayers that are not
[56:46] answered because we're not saying them
[56:49] right we're not praying them the right
[56:52] way
[56:52] we're not confessing I'm doing all
[56:55] brother Donny that's all this modern
[56:56] stuff know it ain't modern this this
[56:59] whole world out here at all this was
[57:01] said 1950 you imagine 1950 don't you to
[57:05] sell all these denominational people
[57:07] they broke into the expects this prophet
[57:10] of God brought decades ago many of them
[57:14] have brought it oh my you go on YouTube
[57:15] and you see all kinds of people making
[57:17] videos well they left the message and I
[57:19] find it so amazing there's all kinds of
[57:21] secular people I hear in preachers and
[57:23] so on that are doing many many more
[57:25] YouTube videos and putting it about the
[57:28] power that William Branham had
[57:29] knowing we are thinking well God let
[57:31] them test if I let him condemn these
[57:33] other people because they realize there
[57:36] was something man that man's life that
[57:38] no one else could touch legal this an
[57:41] allegation of God it was not brother
[57:43] around brother Ben was a sinner say but
[57:44] the grace of God like the rest of it but
[57:46] it's something that God gave him right
[57:50] notice this oh my under first you say
[57:53] that he said he believed him accepted in
[57:55] testify he's the high priest of our
[57:57] confession Hebrews 3:1 setting at the
[58:01] right hand of the Father to make
[58:02] intercession upon our confession we've
[58:05] got to believe it accept it and confess
[58:09] it and he's before the Father to make
[58:13] good anything not that he bought not
[58:20] that he wants you to have that any
[58:23] saying you confess in the redemptive
[58:28] blessings of course notice this in my
[58:32] commission every sinner is saved tonight
[58:35] and the side of Jehovah God but it will
[58:38] never do you any good until ABC accepted
[58:43] and believe it and confess it then he's
[58:47] the high priest of your confession to
[58:50] make it right before God now do you
[58:56] believe he wants you to be healed well I
[59:00] want them had bowed out to pray for
[59:01] almost all I need to do no that's not
[59:03] all you need to do the Bible tells us a
[59:07] vans right on us yes but you need to
[59:10] speak the word
[59:12] you need to say the word and hope this
[59:16] don't go over your head you may actually
[59:17] be anointed by God to speak to that
[59:21] disease in your body and tell it to
[59:25] leave you and it may come by it
[59:29] hearing you say what the prophet said
[59:33] what your pastor saying what evangelists
[59:37] are saying but it may not be the power
[59:40] of my words that'll drive that from your
[59:43] body but it may be the power of your own
[59:46] words now I'm not just talking out of
[59:48] sickness I'm tell Matt if you're bound
[59:50] by by setting sin or whatever it is it
[59:52] all basically comes the same exact same
[59:55] way notice this so accepted believe it
[59:59] in confession then he's the high priest

[1:01:30] bottom of and said don't even worry
[1:01:32] about price well some of you all would
[1:01:34] want to live here in Johnson City no
[1:01:36] more because it wouldn't be a house big
[1:01:38] enough and refined enough and nice
[1:01:40] enough you'd want to move up to
[1:01:42] Washington DC or Baltimore somewhere or
[1:01:45] you could run with the big dogs
[1:01:47] why because somebody had done give you a
[1:01:49] check well let me tell you something
[1:01:51] you've been handed a check when you
[1:01:53] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:55] you have been given a checkbook and the
[1:01:57] Lord Jesus name is on the bottom of it
[1:02:00] Oh hallelujah he's got more money than
[1:02:03] Amazon and Walmart and Target and Kroger
[1:02:06] and Big K and all the rest of put
[1:02:08] together
[1:02:08] he's got more wealth and more riches and
[1:02:11] more mercy and more grace and more power
[1:02:14] and more delivers and he turns that
[1:02:16] checkbook over to you and said child
[1:02:18] whatever you need and my name fill it
[1:02:21] out if you need healing write your check
[1:02:25] Oh Lord I don't want to bother I don't

[1:02:28] complete work over well go ahead and
[1:02:31] feel like that no no no I don't want to
[1:02:33] trouble you so I'm just gonna ask for a
[1:02:35] symbol full and maybe next week I'm not
[1:02:37] going to a tea cup One World do that
[1:02:40] just go ahead and fill it out for the
[1:02:42] full amount all the what if it don't
[1:02:46] happen but what if it does
[1:02:48] oh you can talk yourself out of every
[1:02:52] blessing that God wants you to have with
[1:02:54] them little words well what if it don't
[1:02:57] happen well what if I may read the right
[1:02:59] time look I've looked through every one
[1:03:01] of these quotes of the Prophet uses
[1:03:02] these words checkbook and I never found
[1:03:04] a one of them whether he put the right
[1:03:07] time thing up to us you know what when
[1:03:09] God gives me the cheque I'm gonna ask
[1:03:11] for it if it ain't the right time except
[1:03:13] to the teller to delay it but he won't
[1:03:15] delay because oh my goodness were
[1:03:16] running short I've been in several
[1:03:18] stores in the last few weeks and you
[1:03:19] probably have as well as I have and you
[1:03:21] said they've got science up you're short
[1:03:23] on corn so if you have exact say I
[1:03:25] thought in the United States of America
[1:03:27] we're running short on coins so they
[1:03:29] don't have enough coin I guarantee one
[1:03:31] thing you will never let me make sure I
[1:03:34] emphasize that to you you will never
[1:03:37] have a check that will never be bounced
[1:03:40] on the name of Jesus Christ you will
[1:03:43] never have a check that will come back
[1:03:45] from the bank of heaven and say
[1:03:47] insufficient funds and we're going to
[1:03:49] charge you 50 bucks because you're
[1:03:51] overdrawn you don't have to worry about
[1:03:54] that because Jesus children don't never
[1:03:56] ever draw on their account for the most
[1:03:59] of us we are millionaires we are
[1:04:02] billionaires in the goodness of God but
[1:04:05] we live like paupers my piddle in the
[1:04:16] deposit box at Calvary and give me a
[1:04:18] checkbook and said write whatever you
[1:04:22] want and I'll take care of it just send
[1:04:27] it up to me Oh Maude that's wonderful
[1:04:30] there he is how do you get say what a
[1:04:33] second in a channel art form wherever
[1:04:35] believer no matter what church you
[1:04:36] belong to in your pastor if he's the
[1:04:38] right man he'll tell you that you can be
[1:04:40] saved only saved through faith but not
[1:04:42] through words through faith now you
[1:04:44] believe that you're safe now the first
[1:04:45] thing that comes from the heart you
[1:04:47] believe it then you walk up and confess
[1:04:49] and say I've said Jesus
[1:04:51] that's my personal Savior I believe
[1:04:53] disabled there's not a physical thing
[1:04:56] and the world that you can prove that
[1:05:01] you're saved so a person comes up gives
[1:05:04] our heart to God there is not a physical
[1:05:07] proof that they can give to me to you to
[1:05:09] their life to somebody else that they
[1:05:12] just got saved your eyes are the same
[1:05:16] color you got the same shout on this
[1:05:18] your head go outside the old gang says
[1:05:21] ain't nothing to that but you believe
[1:05:24] there's something to it don't you what
[1:05:26] if you said well I'm going to see how it
[1:05:28] works I will never work out until you
[1:05:31] keep your testimony going you believe
[1:05:36] you're saying all of this you act like
[1:05:39] you're saved you say you're saved and
[1:05:43] you associate with those that are saved
[1:05:49] now watch what is happening now your
[1:05:51] salvation is working its way out the
[1:05:54] work that God did inside of your heart
[1:05:56] it's working its way out it may take
[1:05:59] weeks it may take months who knows how
[1:06:01] long it'll be but eventually every one
[1:06:04] of these aspects will work out of your
[1:06:05] life because you believe you got say you
[1:06:08] token that you got say you're hanging
[1:06:11] around folks say God say well praise the
[1:06:13] Lord if you get sight I'll tell you one
[1:06:16] thing that'll crowd you used to run with
[1:06:17] not only will they feel uncomfortable
[1:06:20] with you you will feel uncomfortable
[1:06:22] with them
[1:06:24] and if they don't you ain't got saved
[1:06:26] yet well praise the Lord
[1:06:29] oh man notices and the same thing will
[1:06:33] take place by divine healing you believe
[1:06:36] you're healed
[1:06:37] you act like you're healed poor to God
[1:06:40] you Akashi healed you you say your heal
[1:06:43] and he's a high priest of your
[1:06:45] confession to make good anything that
[1:06:48] you confess that he's done before the
[1:06:52] Father so oh oh oh god I've got this and
[1:06:55] my body god this is going on Lord I
[1:06:57] claim your healing mother down pray for
[1:06:59] me listen I've felt so good and then on
[1:07:01] Thursday I got a worse I was so sick I
[1:07:03] don't know if I got it or not
[1:07:04] oh gosh your confession watch your
[1:07:07] confession keep that promise of the word
[1:07:09] right before you all but I got worse on
[1:07:11] Thursday that probably is a good sign
[1:07:13] that you got healed on Wednesday night
[1:07:14] but called well it didn't feel it on
[1:07:17] Thursday morning says he is not the high
[1:07:19] priests of your feeling he's not the
[1:07:21] high priest of your ops your downs your
[1:07:23] ins or outs he's the high priest of your
[1:07:26] profession by His stripes I'm healed I'm
[1:07:28] sicker than a dog but I'm healed anyway
[1:07:30] I don't feel like even getting up out of
[1:07:32] the bed but by stripes I'm healed why
[1:07:37] ABC notice this again God is under an
[1:07:41] obligation is worth to the believer that
[1:07:44] will accept this word any word is to see
[1:07:47] if you a accept it and your heart by
[1:07:52] face B believe it C confess it God will
[1:07:57] bring it to pass can you imagine a
[1:07:59] prophet of God saying God will bring
[1:08:02] your words to pass why don't we see more
[1:08:10] of it fear we're afraid
[1:08:14] well priests rather darling
[1:08:22] now this he can't do nothing for you
[1:08:29] till you confess it and he's the high
[1:08:35] priest of your confession in that case
[1:08:38] not even to your face oh I believe I
[1:08:44] believe I believe he's not the high
[1:08:46] priest of your faith he's the high
[1:08:53] priest according to the Bible of your
[1:08:57] confession not even your face even
[1:09:00] couldn't be face until you confess it
[1:09:04] all you've got to accept faith be
[1:09:08] believe it and see confess it that is
[1:09:11] already has done for faith is the
[1:09:13] substance of things hoped for the
[1:09:14] evidence of things not seen
[1:09:17] now when you believed you were saved
[1:09:19] sitting in your seat whatever you are
[1:09:21] accepted it begin to confess it and tell
[1:09:24] people you were saying well you kept on
[1:09:26] Sam I must say the people said there
[1:09:29] ain't no difference singing but you
[1:09:30] believed there was is that right and you
[1:09:34] kept with your confession and after a
[1:09:37] while it worked it worked righteousness
[1:09:43] it worked for the conference case you
[1:09:46] say it'll work deliverance of habits
[1:09:48] it'll work deliverance of healing of
[1:09:50] whatever you got going on it will work
[1:09:53] it out if you keep your heart and your
[1:09:55] face and your mouth together on the same
[1:09:58] page and relearn your ABCs except
[1:10:02] believe confess hallelujah and you kept
[1:10:09] with your confession actually worked
[1:10:11] righteous all your neighbors and
[1:10:14] everybody knows you're safe now but they
[1:10:18] didn't know it then as a matter of fact
[1:10:20] they probably thought oh yeah that's a
[1:10:21] jailhouse conversion and we've seen that
[1:10:23] before hemolysis three weeks
[1:10:25] he won't lie still we my goodness he'll
[1:10:28] boy they look I said praise God you
[1:10:30] talking about a good
[1:10:31] solid Christian yeah you're the someone
[1:10:33] that said ten years ago wouldn't last no
[1:10:34] time but what happened you kept saying
[1:10:37] what God done in your heart you can't
[1:10:41] believing what God did in your heart and
[1:10:43] you confess it and find it that
[1:10:45] confession becomes so manifest now you
[1:10:48] got other people that didn't believe in
[1:10:50] you said what you're saying about
[1:10:51] yourself years ago oh I love them and
[1:10:54] God makes the devil testify this
[1:10:55] greatness don't you if it will work that
[1:10:57] way in salvation cannot it work that way
[1:10:59] I'm high blood pressure cannot it went
[1:11:02] away in a grocery a tumor or tempura
[1:11:04] whatever the setting sin cannot have
[1:11:07] work the same way this is why Satan
[1:11:09] wants to alter our confession in God's
[1:11:12] Word because you believe do you confess
[1:11:18] it why what happened what changed you is
[1:11:21] the high priest of your confession
[1:11:24] setting at the right hand of the Father
[1:11:27] making good what you're confessing not
[1:11:30] making good what he's saying not making
[1:11:34] good what the pastor wants you to be not
[1:11:36] making good what the prophet said about
[1:11:38] you though you not did it that way
[1:11:41] you'll only get it when you and the word
[1:11:44] and the message becomes so one it's what
[1:11:47] you eat it's what you think it's what
[1:11:49] you talk about not just in the bad times
[1:11:58] notice they're sitting at the right hand
[1:12:00] of the father making good what you're
[1:12:02] confessing now it's the same thing is my
[1:12:04] healing you accept him as your healer

[1:16:25] one I like the right thing praise be to
[1:16:30] God
[1:16:31] associate was those who believe in
[1:16:35] healing well your associates has got a
[1:16:37] lot to do with this right here don't
[1:16:40] associate with those who believe in
[1:16:42] healing and God lord have mercy
[1:16:45] God will bring you right out to a
[1:16:50] perfect soundness of Health will not

[1:17:53] high priest of your feelings so when you
[1:17:58] don't feel healed is the best time to
[1:18:01] give the Apostle and high priest of your
[1:18:04] confession something to welcome I don't
[1:18:09] feel nothing don't feel no chills

[1:18:43] gonna fry that devil's hot he's gonna
[1:18:46] get so sick of yearning tonight he's
[1:18:48] gonna go back down inhale and leave us
[1:18:50] alone
[1:18:52] Jesus is a high priest of our confession
[1:18:54] he can't do nothing friends are we
[1:18:57] hearing this he's saying it over and
[1:19:00] over again year after year you find this
[1:19:05] being said over and over and over again
[1:19:07] he can do nothing nothing why it's the
[1:19:15] way he had it planned you and him are
[1:19:21] buddies you need healeth I do God mean
[1:19:31] you steam you do your part I'll do mine
[1:19:38] but God held her work and I'll work with
[1:19:40] you or don't worry I'll never ask you to
[1:19:42] do my part but I will expect you to do
[1:19:45] your own but if we tend to be lazy we
[1:19:49] want him to do both and we sit back and
[1:19:53] drink a big old glass of southern sweet
[1:19:55] tea our hands all kick back behind our
[1:19:58] head wake me up Jesus when you get down
[1:20:04] wait without me you ready to heal me I

[1:20:23] your religion I believe football is your
[1:20:26] religion or been small is your religion

[1:20:36] [Applause]
[1:20:46] sweet Jesus notice this he can't do
[1:20:53] nothing for you
[1:20:54] - first you accept it and confess it
[1:20:57] that it's already done and he will make
[1:21:00] your body your nature come in subject to
[1:21:09] his word do you understand now
[1:21:13] you must act just like it's already done
[1:21:25] so when the doctors told brother branham
[1:21:27] he was going to die he said if you eat
[1:21:31] another bite of solid food your dad so
[1:21:40] he claimed god's promise and acted like
[1:21:43] he was healed it didn't feel like he was
[1:21:50] here when he was farming Tinnell but
[1:21:56] actually a healthier person does fallen
[1:21:57] at your body's way of expelling things
[1:22:02] so what did he do when he get it all
[1:22:05] cleaned up and the mess cleaned up force
[1:22:08] feed himself again and kept saying nice
[1:22:12] chops I'm healed
[1:22:14] why he was acting like he was he'll you
[1:22:18] imagine he enjoyed that we do it one
[1:22:22] time and we're ready to try it I tried
[1:22:24] it you give it a trial one time and
[1:22:26] you're gonna give it up
[1:22:27] you ain't even worthy of heaven you're
[1:22:30] not worried that it's set in this church
[1:22:32] you are not fit to walk down streets of
[1:22:35] gold if you will not give Jesus Christ a
[1:22:38] million times more effort than you give
[1:22:40] Satan you're worthy to burn up and hail
[1:22:43] go on you're deserving if you won't give
[1:22:50] Jesus Christ all that he's done for us
[1:22:52] and we wouldn't give him a million times
[1:22:54] more effort than we give sin and
[1:22:57] debauchery and evil we're not worthy to
[1:22:59] take of the water of life all brother if
[1:23:03] you're my if you're in love with him you
[1:23:05] count the worst day you've ever had as a
[1:23:07] child of God and so billion times higher
[1:23:10] than the best that you ever had as a
[1:23:12] sinner oh thank you Jesus
[1:23:17] notice this he came do nothing for us do
[1:23:22] we already say that he's done it we have
[1:23:24] to confess it or profess it that he's
[1:23:27] done it then he can go to work on it and
[1:23:32] make the intercessions on what he goes
[1:23:36] to work on what you say not in what he
[1:23:41] wants not on what he purchased even on
[1:23:44] his own merit of purity
[1:23:52] I have a few more minutes notice this I
[1:23:58] now challenge the devil to a debate
[1:24:05] Satan you are aware that you are whipped
[1:24:15] that's a son of God that no worries
[1:24:18] standing you have no legal rights Jesus
[1:24:22] Christ my lord stripped you of every
[1:24:26] authority you had when he died at
[1:24:28] Calvary to take away sin and sickness
[1:24:30] you're nothing but a bluff and we're
[1:24:34] calling your bluff you know what when
[1:24:37] our Lord come to the tree curse the tree
[1:24:40] the next day it was withering and our
[1:24:42] Lord said to his disciples have faith in
[1:24:44] God for if you shall say to this
[1:24:48] mountain be moved and don't doubt in
[1:24:50] your heart believe what you've said in
[1:24:52] the saying come to pass you can have
[1:24:54] what you said Satan you know the
[1:24:57] scripture on that and I just taught
[1:25:00] these people that God is in them and if
[1:25:04] God is in them glory to God they speak
[1:25:10] to that disease and say be away from me
[1:25:16] and don't doubt in their heart right
[1:25:19] then that disease customer for Christ
[1:25:26] said so it's not them that speaks it's
[1:25:29] the father that dwells in them that
[1:25:32] speaking they're in need so come out of
[1:25:36] them in the name of Jesus Christ I say
[1:25:38] it's God's servant by message from an
[1:25:41] angel who anointed it has proved to the
[1:25:44] people that Jesus is here and the
[1:25:46] message is right so come out of them in
[1:25:48] the name of Jesus Christ I adjure you to
[1:25:52] leave ever sick person and get into
[1:25:54] outer darkness in the name of the Lord
[1:25:58] Jesus Christ now listen what happens in
[1:26:02] this building in Waterloo Iowa

[1:26:08] seconds
[1:26:09] listening to speaking banger if you go

[1:26:19] building if you're looking listen to his
[1:26:22] meetings and Waterloo oh that's a hard
[1:26:24] time it was terrible
[1:26:25] he just kept pulling and pulling and
[1:26:27] pulling every night but what's this he
[1:26:30] said do you hear that I'm sure you heard
[1:26:33] that how many heard that great roar goes
[1:26:36] through the buildings just if that was
[1:26:38] it surely you won't doubt any longer
[1:26:41] that was God speaking back can't you see

[1:26:58] God notice latter part of this quote he
[1:27:00] says when you're out from Babylon you're
[1:27:02] out from under unbelief you're out from
[1:27:04] under superstition you're out from under
[1:27:06] all these things and you're filled with
[1:27:08] God's own life your voice is his voice
[1:27:15] or it's a god glory to God notice this
[1:27:27] this is super since this woman when she
[1:27:30] left the platform it was thus saith the
[1:27:32] Lord go home and eat Jesus Christ makes
[1:27:36] you well she went home that night a
[1:27:37] friend of hers living in the
[1:27:39] neighborhoods third of force behind her
[1:27:41] each time at the discernment line now
[1:27:42] she had a great big knot on her neck
[1:27:45] here she come all thrilled about her
[1:27:48] neighbor was going to be healed of that
[1:27:49] ulcer that it bothered her so much this
[1:27:52] is one of the hundreds of cases or
[1:27:54] thousands of them this big not sticking
[1:27:57] out on her neck she came up and half
[1:28:00] said no one would have to discern that
[1:28:03] but you're happy about something you've
[1:28:05] been thrilled because that woman sitting
[1:28:09] right over there is a neighbor of yours
[1:28:11] I know some of you Devils I want to
[1:28:15] challenge this message why don't you
[1:28:16] stand up here and do the same thing you
[1:28:19] oh my she thought how in the world could
[1:28:29] that man know that it has to be
[1:28:32] something to reveal it to him someone
[1:28:35] that was said it said notice not about
[1:28:38] himself it was said that something about
[1:28:40] your neck yes do you believe it leave I
[1:28:43] believe it she said with all my heart I
[1:28:45] said thus saith the Lord go home and
[1:28:48] you'll receive your heater the natural
[1:28:51] man looked around and couldn't see no
[1:28:54] sign the woman but they also went home
[1:28:57] and tried to eat like two died all the
[1:29:03] natural man the natural sense the
[1:29:06] feeling still declared the ulcer there
[1:29:13] so after about a week or two had passed
[1:29:17] she went through the neighborhood to all
[1:29:20] of her people in the church testifying
[1:29:23] the Lord has healed me as she did a she
[1:29:29] accepted she did be she believed now
[1:29:34] them two right there and a lot of times
[1:29:36] aren't near as embarrassing and
[1:29:38] humiliating see you see see sometimes
[1:29:44] can be so embarrassing because we're
[1:29:47] putting a plus B together and it
[1:29:52] produces C so when you learn your ABCs
[1:29:56] when you're learning how to spell as a
[1:29:58] child those of you that know enough
[1:30:00] about the advanced algebra you know that
[1:30:03] they also use a B and C and that so
[1:30:08] let's learn how to walk crawl then the
[1:30:12] wall then my Ron the natural wild will
[1:30:15] fly Luna so she accepted she believed
[1:30:21] she goes to the neighborhood confessing
[1:30:25] I'm he'll notices are you
[1:30:28] no not exactly
[1:30:32] ever saying I want now what's this a lot
[1:30:35] of you miss it right here because you
[1:30:38] think to say that statement you're
[1:30:40] talking negative you don't understand
[1:30:43] confession do you well praise God
[1:30:49] so they ask aren't you eating everything
[1:30:51] well well no not exactly
[1:30:53] that's not her confession she's speaking
[1:30:57] symptoms yes
[1:30:58] she's speaking worse she's act but
[1:31:00] that's not her confession either her
[1:31:03] confession is I have already been healed
[1:31:05] [Music]
[1:31:07] Gorda God no not exactly
[1:31:10] ever saying that one but she said I'm
[1:31:13] already healed for about his job some
[1:31:17] healed no matter what it was she was
[1:31:19] healed anyhow I'll order that God one
[1:31:23] morning the children had gone to school
[1:31:24] and she got real hungry she was standing
[1:31:27] washing the dishes by the window she
[1:31:29] came to the meeting another meeting
[1:31:31] about a year later she was washing the
[1:31:33] dishes and when she did first thing she
[1:31:35] felt a real funny feeling go over now we
[1:31:38] know according to another message after
[1:31:39] this the Prophet said the angel of the
[1:31:41] Lord was just moving through that
[1:31:43] neighborhood that day a good time to not
[1:31:46] be a t.j.maxx the names of Lord looking
[1:31:47] for you at the house anything praise be
[1:31:51] to God oh she thought what was that felt
[1:31:58] like not wanted to scream she said oh
[1:32:00] lord we've been there anyway house
[1:32:03] mother told her said honey
[1:32:05] quit oh he didn't tell her to quit
[1:32:12] except it he didn't tell her to quit
[1:32:14] believing but he told her to quit
[1:32:17] talking why the Tolkien produces
[1:32:22] embarrassment not only for the wife the
[1:32:24] father husband hope somebody share any
[1:32:29] of that how do you quit talking about
[1:32:33] that healing said because although he
[1:32:36] was a
[1:32:37] Christian you know bringing in a
[1:32:39] reproach upon the calls how can you
[1:32:43] bring a reproach when your testifying to
[1:32:45] his word brother Ben said you'll bring a
[1:32:47] reproach if you don't testify to it so
[1:32:51] if you were here you were here she said
[1:32:54] that man stood and looked me in the eye
[1:32:56] and told me my conditions and the things
[1:32:59] I'd done who I was where I come from she
[1:33:02] said I hadn't been in that building 15
[1:33:04] minutes when he come to the platform I'm
[1:33:07] on the work of this man no I never saw
[1:33:09] him in my life and he told me until
[1:33:43] thanks I believed it until I'm dead she
[1:33:59] said I'll believe it anyhow so her and
[1:34:03] her sister below her friend had a
[1:34:06] covenant to God that they'd hold that
[1:34:09] faith that morning she felt real fun in
[1:34:15] a few minutes she got hungry the
[1:34:17] children had left some oats in a plate
[1:34:18] little dish and remember said this
[1:34:21] bleeding ulcer that would explode blood
[1:34:23] and she'd vomit blood and blood that
[1:34:25] just spew out of her mouth had to give
[1:34:28] her you know interested in her arms and
[1:34:31] stuff a few minutes she got hungry but
[1:34:34] generally left some oats in a plate in a
[1:34:36] little dish and said oats always just
[1:34:38] burner up you imagine God's gonna use
[1:34:43] the very thing that burner up
[1:34:46] to prove she's healed my goodness some
[1:34:51] of you all used to couldn't pass a
[1:34:53] honky-tonk your vehicle was on autopilot
[1:34:56] every time you'd go through a juke joint
[1:34:59] your steering wheel just something you
[1:35:03] couldn't pass up a cigarette you
[1:35:04] couldn't pass up a drink I don't care
[1:35:07] who it was it offered it to you you look
[1:35:09] for an excuse to have one brother you
[1:35:11] get tanked up now full of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:13] you can pass for every bar every juke
[1:35:15] joint if Satan's got a list for liquor
[1:35:17] all the way from here to in Annapolis
[1:35:19] and back you can drive all the way and
[1:35:21] be as thirsty as a hound dog in the
[1:35:22] middle of the desert and you wouldn't
[1:35:24] stop and take a drink of that at all why
[1:35:26] because the thirst for the thing is gone
[1:35:28] and left you its do something for you
[1:35:33] and the outs they used to kill your
[1:35:34] stomach and gobble said that's what I
[1:35:37] want you to prove your heel by hey
[1:35:39] damos what's this she reached down and
[1:35:48] took a couple of bites of those oats no
[1:35:51] mash
[1:35:52] she said I'll have to pay for it
[1:35:56] see there again some of you would have
[1:35:59] never said that what you don't
[1:36:00] understand confession you do not
[1:36:04] understand confession you saying being a
[1:36:08] human and feeling big salts of fear and
[1:36:11] doubt you feel like oh god that's no how
[1:36:14] does song well why did he become that
[1:36:16] thing so you imagine this comes out of
[1:36:23] her mouth but not her heart person said
[1:36:28] this was not her confession this was her
[1:36:31] fear talking all glory their God
[1:36:35] I'll pay for it I suppose but one of
[1:36:39] these days I'll be all right little did
[1:36:42] you know today was that day
[1:36:46] you see a person can be right on right
[1:36:49] on time right in face and still the
[1:36:51] miracle is only minutes away and we
[1:36:54] still don't know what brother Wayne and
[1:36:55] we can be saying things like this but
[1:36:57] this was not altering her profession her
[1:37:00] husband couldn't change it the church
[1:37:02] couldn't change it
[1:37:03] fear couldn't change it Phelan couldn't
[1:37:05] change it I'm gonna be healed but she
[1:37:13] noticed she was still hungry so she just

[1:38:16] bonnet down the street into this

[1:40:05] testifying giving God praise he brought
[1:40:08] such our approach they claimed in the
[1:40:11] neighborhood until one of Sunday a group
[1:40:14] of ministers come in and sat down by him
[1:40:18] and said you must stop doing that notice
[1:40:21] where Satan wants to stop you the most
[1:40:25] say they didn't tell him to stop
[1:40:30] accepting they didn't tell him to stop

[1:40:57] don't nuts so it's going to get us out
[1:41:02] of here you're bringing a reproach on
[1:41:08] the calls and the young men sitting
[1:41:10] there said mister if you were sitting
[1:41:12] where I am and you were in the chair
[1:41:15] that I'm sitting in you wouldn't try to
[1:41:18] rob me of the last hope that I've gotten
[1:41:22] Christ said by His stripes he no more
[1:41:34] then said that setting their paralyzed
[1:41:37] feet hands body back no more than said
[1:41:43] that out of the chair he went who the
[1:41:49] you know what if they would have
[1:41:53] talked about it I'm sorry yeah yeah I'm
[1:41:56] so I apologize forgive me for bringing
[1:41:58] reproach no doubt brother Jim here too
[1:42:00] missed his healing his natural senses
[1:42:06] all he said that the doctor said he'll
[1:42:08] be there forever as long as he lives but
[1:42:10] the six Sam said by his stripes it's
[1:42:16] casting away everything contrary to what
[1:42:18] God said that's what the six centers
[1:42:22] this for what do you need from him to
[1:42:30] that oh you said only I believe all that
[1:42:35] but the problem is you ain't brother
[1:42:36] branham you just never figured that out
[1:42:40] you're right I'm not brother BAM but let
[1:42:44] me give you a simple something that the
[1:42:47] Lord Jesus dropped in my heart today
[1:42:50] I'm not brother Brennan and neither is
[1:42:54] brother branham Hebrews 13:8
[1:42:59] the bible does not say william branham
[1:43:02] the same yesterday today and forever but
[1:43:07] jesus christ right i'm not william
[1:43:11] branham
[1:43:12] i'm not this man or that man or that man
[1:43:14] but he is still jesus christ the same
[1:43:18] yesterday today and forever
[1:43:35] Oh John Ryan not rya n but our hy in
[1:43:46] blind beggar in Fort Wayne was there
[1:43:49] that day was prayed for in the meeting
[1:43:51] that was the night the piano played the
[1:43:54] Great Physician now was near without
[1:43:57] anybody in it by rather he was blind
[1:44:01] Catholic by faith he stopped in the line
[1:44:03] I looked at message your name is
[1:44:05] so-and-so John Ryan yes you're a beggar
[1:44:06] on the corner you've been blind for
[1:44:08] years yes that right you're Catholic by
[1:44:09] faith that's right I said thus saith the
[1:44:11] Lord you receive your healing thank you
[1:44:13] sir I said thank the Lord he said but I
[1:44:18] can't see and I said that has nothing to
[1:44:22] do is it can't you imagine friends how
[1:44:25] strange and odd that brother brems he
[1:44:29] teaching on healing was to the majority
[1:44:32] the people you tell him man he's healed
[1:44:34] they said by the king states that that
[1:44:35] is nothing to it well I thought that's
[1:44:37] what he's being prayed for but that is
[1:44:39] nothing to do with it it shows how
[1:44:41] little we understood about divine him
[1:44:43] sometimes I wonder how much people still
[1:44:45] understand to be honest I can't say that
[1:44:48] is nothing to do with it your heal
[1:44:49] anyone along they helped him off the
[1:44:52] platform the natural man could see
[1:44:53] nothing they couldn't see no results

[1:48:18] believe with you hallelujah I got a much
[1:48:28] more Goodman so I want to read all can
[1:48:33] it be that simple brother Donnie my
[1:48:35] friends it is just that simple
[1:48:37] I go to text today from one of my
[1:48:40] dearest friends for the template sharing
[1:48:45] with me about his wife sister Karen had
[1:48:48] the brain bleed a few weeks ago as you
[1:48:50] know the doctors had told me my honours
[1:48:53] will get prepared for death and if she
[1:48:56] does live she'll be nothing but a
[1:48:58] vegetable but it sent me a little text
[1:49:02] today and said praise God Karen is
[1:49:06] sitting down in a little place sure they
[1:49:08] moved her into rehab don't let her go
[1:49:09] home Tuesday Lord woman Karen is sitting
[1:49:12] in little places down here from where
[1:49:13] I'm sitting with her sister and they're
[1:49:17] setting they're putting a 300 piece
[1:49:19] jigsaw puzzle together not bad for a
[1:49:22] woman who's supposed to be a vegetable
[1:49:27] that just a few days ago couldn't even
[1:49:29] turn on a cell phone that's my father
[1:49:36] that's our God hallelujah you believe it
[1:49:41] oh my
[1:49:45] whatever you need is tonight friend I'm
[1:49:48] sure many of you know our daughter Erica
[1:49:54] the doctors found a a grouse on her
[1:49:58] liver and they're going to do more tests
[1:50:00] and they think that this is not the
[1:50:03] origin of words come from that it's from
[1:50:05] somewhere else I appreciate all that
[1:50:09] doctors can do to help us but my faith
[1:50:14] my anchor is not in medical science
[1:50:18] oh sure if God wants to minister to her
[1:50:21] through medical science absolutely but
[1:50:23] I've seen medical science fails so many
[1:50:25] times I ain't ever seen God fail wants
[1:50:28] once her whole life she's been a miracle
[1:50:33] I said she could never live said she
[1:50:37] never lived normal never have children
[1:50:40] three of those never have or standing
[1:50:44] tonight the seven she got pregnant with
[1:50:47] her babies should probably have to go on
[1:50:49] dialysis because your kidney function
[1:50:51] would go down so low
[1:50:52] God said watch me work so instead of it
[1:50:56] going down
[1:50:57] God sent it up they told Rachel she
[1:51:02] burst in babies don't never get pregnant
[1:51:03] again she got pregnant again another set
[1:51:05] of twins I said your kidney function
[1:51:06] I'll go down this time God said but
[1:51:09] don't you remember what I'd done last
[1:51:10] time God sent her function up
[1:51:12] I remember today like it was yesterday
[1:51:21] what they stuck that big needle in her
[1:51:26] body and they couldn't sedate her she
[1:51:30] was screaming and hollering
[1:51:35] and I took off runnin down the hospital
[1:51:41] I reminded him of that today I've seen
[1:51:49] him do so much and I believe this is no
[1:51:55] greater I'm sure that you and your needs
[1:52:00] and your requests tonight it may be just
[1:52:03] as traumatic it would be a sin for us to
[1:52:09] disbelieve after what we've seen him -
[1:52:16] hallelujah we're gonna pray I want you
[1:52:19] to hold your request your need we know
[1:52:22] there are several people in our church
[1:52:23] that have real real desperate needs if
[1:52:25] the Lord puts one of them people on your
[1:52:27] heart be sure and hold it now maybe
[1:52:29] you're doing pretty good right now but
[1:52:30] we've got several people that really
[1:52:32] need a move of God we're gonna greet
[1:52:35] together the Lord's gonna move for them
[1:52:40] we've got one miracle after another the
[1:52:43] standing here tonight that's been healed
[1:52:44] delivered set free you see people who
[1:52:49] are miracles have no problem believing
[1:52:52] in miracles that's why I'm convinced
[1:52:55] that people this day don't believe in
[1:52:56] miracles because they've never become
[1:52:58] one themselves but if you ever become a
[1:53:00] miracle by the new birth miracles is
[1:53:02] just something that's what you are
[1:53:04] just pray together ken my Heavenly
[1:53:09] Father thank you for your word tonight
[1:53:12] lord I know it's been simple a-b-c the

[1:53:50] sisters Lord when one of our brothers
[1:53:53] and sisters hurt we hurt with some God
[1:53:57] when they have a bad diagnosis we would
[1:54:00] cry with some but then when we get done
[1:54:03] crying we wipe our tears and we believe
[1:54:05] with them because that's who we are we
[1:54:09] are believers we bring them to you to

[1:59:02] oh brother Donnie I believe it but don't
[1:59:05] feel that nothing happen always keep
[1:59:07] this in mind you speak to this mountain
[1:59:09] that it must be removed but this is the
[1:59:12] way God will have to have it to happen
[1:59:13] sometimes there might be a couple of
[1:59:16] grains of sand that fall on the opposite
[1:59:19] side of where your eyes can see that
[1:59:22] mountain be maybe billions of tons you
[1:59:25] never heard it you never saw it you
[1:59:27] never felt it but on the other side of
[1:59:29] the mountain some little tiny grains of
[1:59:31] sand fell off your faith made it move a
[1:59:35] man let your faith remain and the
[1:59:39] mountain will be moved out of your way
[1:59:41] unless you let the devil talk you out of
[1:59:43] it what if God desires to move the
[1:59:45] backside of the mountain first and he
[1:59:47] wants you to be faithful by the fronts
[1:59:49] out of the mountain seems solid and
[1:59:51] stable but keep believing I can't
[1:59:53] explain it
[1:59:54] I don't understand it but I believe
[1:59:56] God's Word but John Ryan by stop some
[2:00:00] heal not the crippled boy by strap some
