[35:01] battle and you feel
[35:03] that you're
[35:05] [Music]
[35:06] losing the
[35:12] war and the fact
[35:14] is that it's raged
[35:17] on for so
[35:23] long that your steps have grown
[35:29] wey and

[42:07] there running fever but we want to thank
[42:09] brother Donnie for having us uh glad
[42:11] that he and sister curl can get away and
[42:13] trust that they can get a time of
[42:14] refreshing after everything settles here
[42:17] and want to say thank you to brother
[42:18] Caleb and sister Ruth for having us
[42:21] they've taken us in like
[42:22] orphans but I'm going to tell you man
[42:24] I've been living like a king and that
[42:26] house it's been wonderful I just told my
[42:29] wife said I sure hope we hadn't
[42:31] overextended our stay but we're we're
[42:33] greatly honored to be here and we bring
[42:35] greetings from our church our pastor
[42:36] brother Tim but if you have your Bibles
[42:38] here I want to speak to you tonight on
[42:40] this ain't going to be the
[42:42] end this ain't going to be the end you
[42:46] believe that tonight how many of you
[42:48] come to have church tonight now Brother
[42:50] Louie kind of gave a preface of how I
[42:51] preach so you know you've seen us uh I'm
[42:54] not going to be a berserk up here but we
[42:56] just want to say something that's going
[42:57] to encourage you but we find here in 2
[42:59] Corinthians 4 and: 7 but we have this
[43:02] treasure this treasure in Earth and
[43:04] vessels that the Excellency of the power
[43:07] may be of God and not of us we are
[43:09] troubled on every side yet not
[43:11] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[43:14] despair persecuted but not forsaken cast
[43:17] down but not destroyed always bearing
[43:20] about in the body the dying of the Lord
[43:22] Jesus that the life also of Jesus might
[43:25] be made made manifest in our body for we
[43:28] which live are always delivered unto
[43:31] death of for jesus' sake that the life
[43:33] also of Jesus might be made manifest in
[43:35] our mortal flesh so then death worketh
[43:38] in us but life in you we have the same
[43:41] Spirit of Faith according as it is
[43:43] written I believe and therefore have I
[43:46] spoken we also believe and therefore
[43:49] speak knowing that he which raised up
[43:51] the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by
[43:54] Jesus and shall present in us with you
[43:57] for all things are for your sakes that
[43:59] the abundant grace might through
[44:00] Thanksgiving of many redound to the
[44:02] glory of God for which cause we faint
[44:05] not but though our outward man's outward
[44:07] man perish yet the inward man is renewed
[44:10] day by day for our light Affliction
[44:12] which is but for a moment worketh for us
[44:14] a far more exceeding and external weight
[44:17] of Glory while we look not on the things
[44:19] which are seen but the things which are
[44:20] not seen for the things which are seen
[44:22] are temporal but the things which are
[44:25] not seen are Eternal God bless you
[44:27] tonight you can have your seats sure
[44:29] enjoy the specials and the youth choir
[44:32] it's great to see the young people
[44:33] appreciate that great to see the young
[44:35] people tonight just worshiping the Lord
[44:38] I think we have seen a change in our
[44:39] youth in this message over the last
[44:41] maybe the five to six years we've seen a
[44:43] shift we've seen those that you know
[44:45] they didn't want to have anything to do
[44:47] with it it was the rules of dos and
[44:48] don'ts but now there's been such a love
[44:50] affair and these young people are are
[44:52] just apt to get to every camp meeting
[44:54] they can I know for you got four kids
[44:57] like me you take out home loans and send
[44:58] them to these camps because it means
[45:00] that much to you but you know I just
[45:02] enjoy to see their Zeal for the Lord and
[45:04] so thankful for that we look here in
[45:06] Psalms 34:18 the Bible says that the
[45:08] Lord is nigh unto them that have a
[45:10] broken heart and he saveth such as be of
[45:13] a contrite spirit many are the
[45:16] afflictions of the righteous but the
[45:18] Lord
[45:25] when we become a Christian and our lives
[45:27] are committed to God it's not going to
[45:29] be a flowery better eats it's not going
[45:31] to be just you know cupcakes and and and
[45:33] pancakes and anything else and and
[45:35] things like that but we're going to go
[45:36] through hard times and even as churches
[45:38] we're going to face difficult moments
[45:40] but the Bible says the Lord deliver them
[45:42] out of them all we have a promise
[45:44] tonight that God will deliver God's not
[45:47] going to allow you to keep going down in
[45:49] that same path of Destruction God's not
[45:51] going to let your young people go down
[45:53] in destruction but we have a promise
[45:55] that God is is faithful and he's
[45:57] faithful to his word and he's faithful
[45:59] to his people that will uphold his
[46:01] word and we know that as long as we're
[46:03] in this world and long as we're in these
[46:05] bodies I don't know about you but these
[46:07] bodies ain't perfect yet but as long as
[46:09] we're in these this body this this
[46:12] decaying Humanity we're going to face
[46:14] trouble we're going to face hardships
[46:16] we're going to face many difficult times
[46:18] but though this outward man perish the
[46:21] Bible says the inward man is renewed day
[46:24] by day by day by day by day how are you
[46:27] renewed cuz you feed on the word of God
[46:30] day by day by day by day we're not
[46:32] trying to get in on our own marriage or
[46:34] what family we're born into or or what
[46:36] church we're attend no the inward man is
[46:39] renewed by the word of God that's why
[46:41] God sent us a prophet God sent us a
[46:43] prophet to turn our hearts back to the
[46:45] faith so that the inward man would be
[46:47] renewed and draw strength from the word
[46:50] because he knows this is not how it
[46:52] [Applause]
[46:54] ends on oh Hallelujah see there's going
[46:56] to be times and it feels like even here
[46:59] maybe for a local church you're feeling
[47:01] like it's trouble on every side yeah
[47:04] trouble on every side but the inward man
[47:06] is invigorated he's renewed and the
[47:08] Bible tells us I love how the Bible puts
[47:11] it we're troubled on every side that
[47:13] word trouble means to be
[47:15] squeezed how about how many of you have
[47:17] ever been squeezed you just you feel the
[47:19] pressure of this age you know some
[47:21] people are looking for a squeeze
[47:23] stupid I'm ain't looking for I'm looking
[47:26] to get out of the squeeze but people are
[47:28] looking for the squeeze to come and when
[47:30] the squeeze comes we know he's coming
[47:32] look church I don't know if you're dep
[47:33] dumb and blind but the squeeze is here
[47:36] we're persecuted on every side the Bible
[47:38] tells us we're troubled we're squeezed
[47:40] we're in his grasp we're pressed hard
[47:43] but not distressed Oh Glory to God
[47:45] tonight we may be in a battle but we
[47:47] ain't lost to war yet we may be
[47:50] persecuted but God is still on our side
[47:52] the facts may be stacked against you but
[47:54] the truth is we've already won the truth
[47:57] is we serve a living God the truth is
[48:00] he's still on the
[48:04] throne Bible tells us that we're
[48:06] perplexed and that word perplex is
[48:08] filled with
[48:10] uncertainty sometimes how many sometimes
[48:13] you don't know which way to
[48:14] go you're praying for answers and
[48:16] answers are not there you're trusting
[48:19] and you're like Lord are you even
[48:20] hearing my prayer the Bible says we're
[48:23] we're perplexed we fill with uncertainty
[48:25] yet not in Despair and the word despair
[48:28] is at at a complete loss as those that
[48:31] have no Hope Oh church we got a hope we
[48:34] got our anchor steadfast and sure that's
[48:37] behind the veil let me tell you we got
[48:39] something to be glad about tonight we
[48:41] got something to worship God about
[48:43] tonight will you say brother Joe
[48:44] something just drastically happened to
[48:46] our church I understand that and I
[48:49] grieve with you but yet the word is
[48:51] still true God is going to see us
[48:53] through this God is going to see you
[48:55] through this oh this ain't the end
[48:57] church this is only the beginning of
[49:00] great things for Word of Life
[49:03] Church bible would tell us that we're
[49:07] persecuted pursue from place to place
[49:10] follow around with menaces and curses
[49:13] and reproaches imprisoned and threatened
[49:15] with the severest of tortures I don't
[49:17] know about you but my I feel like that
[49:19] every
[49:20] day we're persecuted but not forsaken
[49:24] brother Jackie thank you Lord Brother
[49:26] Jackie even in your old age you may have
[49:28] been persecuted and you've been
[49:30] perplexed there's been times you didn't
[49:31] know which way to turn but God had never
[49:33] left you alone and you're still here as
[49:35] a mighty warrior still standing for this
[49:38] truth sa said well I'm going to take
[49:40] them I'm going to take them by this and
[49:42] I'll take him by that but the devil
[49:43] don't have the final
[49:45] say God has the final word God has the
[49:49] final say and he's here to T tonight it
[49:51] ain't going to end like
[49:53] that amen we've been cast down and that
[49:57] word there means to be thrown down
[49:58] dashed into pieces but yet not destroyed
[50:02] oh I love that not not ruined we don't
[50:04] lose that word destroyed there means to
[50:06] lose we don't lose Church why CU God
[50:10] can't
[50:11] lose and though we're troubled on every
[50:14] side perplexed and persecuted and cast
[50:16] down the Bible never states that the
[50:19] believer is defeated right the Bible
[50:22] never states that we we go down and
[50:25] defeat we lose it's over that's not what
[50:27] the Bible says but to every
[50:29] contradiction to the persecution God
[50:32] said there's a promise of Resurrection
[50:34] God says there's a promise of a new day
[50:36] God says there's a promise that this is
[50:37] not how it end it ain't over until God
[50:40] says it's over and God's still on the
[50:42] throne he's still full of rich and mercy
[50:44] and Grace for you
[50:46] [Applause]
[50:48] tonight many times the adversary has Us
[50:51] in his
[50:52] grassp many times we're troubled amilies
[50:55] go through
[50:56] Cycles troubles in the
[50:59] home churches go through Cycles Seasons
[51:03] trouble come to
[51:07] churches it seems like the adversary
[51:10] wants to get you at your weakest
[51:14] moment when you've been in battle and
[51:17] you you smelt the breath of the enemy in
[51:19] your face grasp his hands upon you
[51:22] brother that's real when he whispers in
[51:24] your ear said there's no hope for you
[51:26] you might as well quit you might as well
[51:29] stop while you even trying don't you
[51:31] understand you just wasting your time
[51:33] the pastor's time the church's time your
[51:35] family's time you're wasting their time
[51:37] but I'm here to tell you tonight you're
[51:38] not wasting time church God has called
[51:41] you for this oh let me just tell you
[51:44] like one back in 19 1979 there was a man
[51:48] by the name of John Paul Jones how many
[51:50] famili with John Paul Jones oh he was a
[51:52] he was a general there and he he sailed
[51:55] the Great season this was during the
[51:56] Revolutionary War time and it was the
[51:58] battle at
[51:59] flambo and yet here he was little lone
[52:02] ship he was after the British
[52:06] army sometimes you may feel isolated
[52:08] sometimes you may feel all alone and he
[52:10] had 41 ships that were coming against
[52:12] him and he turned his boat to the
[52:14] broadside of the enemy ship and he
[52:17] blasted his two 18lb guns and when they
[52:19] blasted the the the guns blew up and
[52:22] blew a great big hole in the ship and
[52:24] the ship was on fire and his ship was
[52:26] taking in water and it seemed like he
[52:28] was going down and the captain from the
[52:30] other ship said do you surrender he said
[52:33] I have yet begun to fight oh come on
[52:36] church tonight oh you may have been hit

[53:15] this morning or this evening and he sent
[53:17] me a text the day before sister Erica

[53:44] it ends in defeat it looks like we're
[53:45] taking on water it looks like we're
[53:47] destroyed oh it looks like we're
[53:49] persecuted it looks like we're defeated
[53:51] oh but Church we're not persecuted we're

[56:02] us doesn't
[56:04] it fear begins to grip us but you know
[56:08] I'm
[56:09] determined to preach Faith like never
[56:14] before and God is still on the
[56:17] throne either God's word is truth or
[56:20] it's not that's either he's a Healer or
[56:22] he's not either he's a deliverer or he's
[56:24] not right either the prodical come home
[56:26] or they don't but I'm going to tell you
[56:28] I can testify that God is his word and
[56:31] his word never fails in the mouth of a
[56:34] Believer amen yes sir but Satan wants
[56:36] you to give up he wants you to surrender
[56:38] he don't want you to think there's any
[56:39] chance of survival he wants you to think
[56:41] that death is the only
[56:44] option he doesn't want you to
[56:48] fight but Winston Churchill would say it
[56:50] like this when his country was in the
[56:53] greatest battle of their life
[56:55] greatest conflict he said we shall
[56:58] defend our
[57:00] Island whatever the cost we shall fight

[57:06] landing grounds we shall fight in the
[57:07] fields and in the streets we shall fight
[57:10] in the Hills we shall Never
[57:13] Surrender maybe the devil's whispering
[57:15] in your ear surrender just give up walk

[1:01:50] might see put on the whole armor of God
[1:01:54] and there's no armor for the
[1:01:57] back there's no retreat for the believer
[1:01:59] there's no surrender for the believer
[1:02:02] it's a on full on battle full on war you
[1:02:06] got to face him head
[1:02:09] on we find here says that we wrestle not
[1:02:12] against flesh and blood but against
[1:02:14] principalities against Powers against
[1:02:16] rulers of Darkness of this world against
[1:02:19] spiritual wickedness in high
[1:02:23] places then he says take unto us the
[1:02:25] whole armor of God that we may be able
[1:02:28] to withstand in the evil day that's this
[1:02:32] day God has prepared us to stand in this
[1:02:35] day and he's given us the equipment by
[1:02:37] which we are to stand in this day take
[1:02:39] on this word notice we're wrestling it's
[1:02:42] a contest we're not wrestling with flesh
[1:02:44] and blood me and brother Andrew or me
[1:02:46] and brother Joe or me and this other
[1:02:48] brother we're not wrestling because
[1:02:49] maybe I'm just a little bitty
[1:02:51] pipsqueak I mean I'm 5'5 and and a
[1:02:56] half that's right give me a hand
[1:02:59] [Music]

[1:03:19] get the shorter you get the lost I mean
[1:03:21] I lost my hair thank God I got my wits
[1:03:23] about me
[1:03:24] but we find that we're fighting against
[1:03:27] principalities against wickedness in
[1:03:29] high places we're fighting to get back
[1:03:32] in our position as Sons and Daughters of
[1:03:35] God and their Satan and his minions and
[1:03:37] devil after devil trying to keep you
[1:03:40] from getting back to your position Satan
[1:03:42] don't want you to recognize who you are
[1:03:45] but from the beginning in the mind of
[1:03:47] God you always was a Son of God you
[1:03:50] always will be a Son of God there ain't
[1:03:52] enough devils in hell can take that away
[1:03:55] and if that's the casee then it don't
[1:03:57] have to end like this it don't have to
[1:03:59] go down like this we can take our
[1:04:01] position take our Authority and take our
[1:04:04] rights to the word and back Satan in a
[1:04:08] corner
[1:04:10] sir amen we find today that many
[1:04:14] Believers even Christians many
[1:04:16] Believers today they're wrestling
[1:04:18] against
[1:04:20] anxieties fears brother Andrew how many
[1:04:23] times you deal with anx XY and fear and
[1:04:24] prayer
[1:04:25] lines fear that I'm not going to be
[1:04:28] healed fear that I'm not going to be
[1:04:29] saved fear that I can't keep the Holy
[1:04:31] Ghost fear that I'm going to go down in
[1:04:33] the feet worried about this anxiety and
[1:04:36] all pressur it
[1:04:37] up we they wrestle against
[1:04:40] depression
[1:04:41] complexes demon
[1:04:44] oppression and see these are not flesh
[1:04:46] and blood battles because if they were
[1:04:48] Flesh and Blood battles we'd go out and
[1:04:51] get the best AR-15 we can buy man man
[1:04:54] we' have an armor
[1:04:55] full we could take care of but these
[1:04:58] things that you can't just go out and
[1:04:59] buy some weapon no but God has provided
[1:05:03] you exactly what you have need of God
[1:05:05] has given us the greatest protection not
[1:05:08] only for a defense but God has giving
[1:05:10] you what you need for an offensive War
[1:05:13] you know what I think many times we pray
[1:05:15] and we oh God help us here and oh God
[1:05:17] help us there and when the enemy comes
[1:05:19] in or we're in the battle we're in the
[1:05:21] midst of the trenches it's always the
[1:05:23] bride playing def I'm here to tell you
[1:05:25] tonight it's time that the bride takes
[1:05:27] the promises of God and goes on the
[1:05:30] offense the Bible says that I'll never
[1:05:32] leave you I'll never forsake you so when
[1:05:35] you're in the midst of the battle he's
[1:05:36] right there when the when hell's all
[1:05:38] against you he's right there there's no
[1:05:40] way for the believer to go down in the
[1:05:42] feet so Square your shoulders back
[1:05:43] tonight and begin to press the devil I'm
[1:05:46] not backing up Satan I'm not giving up
[1:05:48] tonight I'm holding this word that faith
[1:05:51] is the promise healing is my promise
[1:05:53] deliver is my promise my kids are my
[1:05:56] promise my family is my promise my
[1:05:58] marriage is my promise I'm taking God at
[1:06:01] his word
[1:06:02] tonight it's my promise I'm not backing
[1:06:06] off of
[1:06:07] It Go on the offense for
[1:06:12] [Music]
[1:06:13] once but B tell us in putting on the
[1:06:16] whole arm of God he said we don't
[1:06:18] wrestle with tow holds flesh and blood
[1:06:20] but we wrestle against spiritual powers
[1:06:26] wrestlers see they practice on breaking
[1:06:28] toe holes and things he says but you
[1:06:29] don't break these toe holes no he says
[1:06:32] could you imagine a wrestler come
[1:06:34] out with his fingernails
[1:06:38] polished got his little jelly band on
[1:06:41] what would Jesus do he wouldn't be
[1:06:43] wearing a jelly
[1:06:49] band oh I better watch out huh right I'm
[1:06:52] not at home brother Joe
[1:06:56] oh got his fingernails polishes trunks
[1:06:58] on wearing shorts got his trunks
[1:07:01] on oh yeah we still believe in a
[1:07:03] clothline religion the last time I
[1:07:06] heard he goes but you don't break these
[1:07:09] toes no coming out there with his
[1:07:11] fingernails polished trunks on with all
[1:07:13] kind of gold beads around it he goes
[1:07:15] look like a pretty good wrestler but
[1:07:16] that's just only
[1:07:18] intellectual see he hasn't got a hidden
[1:07:20] strength there that when the enemy gets
[1:07:22] a Toe Hold on him that he can just pull
[1:07:24] them out of it see his intellectual
[1:07:26] beads around him and everything don't
[1:07:27] make much difference so all of our
[1:07:29] intellectual means nothing if there're
[1:07:31] is a hidden power that's right you can
[1:07:34] know this Bible backwards and forwards
[1:07:35] you can know every quote backwards and
[1:07:37] forward but if there is no anointing
[1:07:39] behind it if there's no power behind it
[1:07:41] it ain't nothing but head knowledge let
[1:07:42] me tell you God you'll take that head
[1:07:44] knowledge and you go right to hell with
[1:07:46] head knowledge but God has given us an
[1:07:47] anointing in this hour God has given us
[1:07:49] a word in this hour and it's got to be
[1:07:51] more than intellectual understanding
[1:07:53] it's got to be a Supernatural anointing
[1:07:55] behind this word to make this word live
[1:07:58] to go out into the highways and the
[1:08:00] byways and catch young men by the name
[1:08:02] of Reed ball and bring them back to the
[1:08:04] house of God oh in an unexpected place
[1:08:07] in an unexpected way he goes into some
[1:08:09] old place to have breakfast not even his
[1:08:12] favorite
[1:08:14] place I think God's pretty on time it
[1:08:17] may not be in his favorite place but it
[1:08:18] was God's favorite place and God thought
[1:08:21] so much to come by there and he was just
[1:08:23] obl bit annoyed with the old man that
[1:08:25] begin to bring him the
[1:08:27] word you may be a little bit annoyed
[1:08:29] tonight with the young man that's
[1:08:31] bringing you the
[1:08:32] word right oh but God God's going to
[1:08:37] never lose it may look like he was going
[1:08:39] down in the feet drugs ravishing his
[1:08:42] life destroyed him pulled him out of the
[1:08:44] house of God his own daddy didn't want
[1:08:46] anything to do with him right don't
[1:08:48] bring your hide to my house I don't want
[1:08:50] to be around
[1:08:52] that but God said they don't have to end
[1:08:54] that
[1:08:55] way God said it ain't over
[1:08:58] yet God says I got the final say God
[1:09:01] says you come from God you come from my
[1:09:04] thoughts and if you come from my
[1:09:05] thoughts and that seed is on the inside
[1:09:07] I don't care how much dirt That Old
[1:09:09] Devil puts on you how much se he puts on
[1:09:12] you whatever he it ain't going to stop
[1:09:14] that seed Oh Glory to God it ain't going
[1:09:16] to stop that seed that seed is coming up
[1:09:19] it's going to come up tonight Church
[1:09:21] somebody will take that word and believe
[1:09:23] it's for me it's for my young person

[1:09:31] could save re ball it can save your
[1:09:33] child oh it ain't got to end that way

[1:13:46] devil off and brother Matt McGary came
[1:13:48] back here and we just begin to work with

[1:14:38] can't remain here she don't want you
[1:14:40] here and by the authority of this word
[1:14:42] we cast you out and that thing left her
[1:14:45] and she went back inside rejoicing and
[1:14:47] praising God and she was just at our
[1:14:49] meetings and she still rejoicing and
[1:14:51] praising God what am I telling I'm
[1:14:53] telling you that God has the final say
[1:14:57] God has the final burdi God has the
[1:14:59] final word your condition ain't too too
[1:15:02] far for God to move on tonight he's
[1:15:05] still on the throne
[1:15:07] Church brother will tell us he defeated
[1:15:10] Satan with it is
[1:15:12] written I didn't come up with some
[1:15:14] psychology to pray for that young girl I
[1:15:16] just laid hands on and prayed I just
[1:15:21] believed and you better know you stand
[1:15:23] when you start fighting Toe to Toe with
[1:15:25] an
[1:15:26] enemy brother tell us the word of God
[1:15:29] will defeat Satan any place anywhere

[1:15:38] church at your house in your quiet time
[1:15:41] the word of God will defeat Satan
[1:15:44] anywhere any time under any
[1:15:49] condition but it takes a hidden man of
[1:15:51] the heart oh let me just keep moving on
[1:15:54] here woo yall a good crowd to preach to
[1:15:57] tonight Bible would tell us in Romans
[1:16:00] 8 they that are after The Flesh do mind
[1:16:03] the things of the flesh 8 and verse 5
[1:16:06] but they that are after the spirit the
[1:16:08] things of the spirit for to be carnally
[1:16:10] minded is death but to be spiritually
[1:16:13] minded is life and
[1:16:17] peace now I know I'm sitting here
[1:16:20] talking to a bunch of
[1:16:21] cherubs y'all ain't never never had a
[1:16:23] colal thought have you not
[1:16:26] us nope we're Word of Life
[1:16:33] JC yeah we got this thing covered up
[1:16:35] brother Joe look
[1:16:36] around no we got colel th Church come on
[1:16:40] but the Bible says to be carnally minded
[1:16:43] see to be carnally minded is imity it's
[1:16:46] it's against God see it cannot please
[1:16:48] God but the the colel mind is imity
[1:16:51] against God but and we're told that that
[1:16:53] though that walk after the spirit and
[1:16:56] that's what we want to get into tonight
[1:16:57] is the spirit we don't want to walk in
[1:16:58] and come into church all worked up in
[1:17:00] our cality and in our minds and all the
[1:17:03] pressures of the world you we're living
[1:17:04] in Leo DEA we're living in Satan's Eden
[1:17:07] and we hear wars and rumors of war and
[1:17:08] we're worried about Israel we worried
[1:17:10] about Ukraine and got all this on them M
[1:17:12] no that ain't our that's not our
[1:17:15] battle that's not for us to worry about
[1:17:18] God's got all that worked out but to be
[1:17:21] carnally minded is to the things of the
[1:17:24] flesh to give into the things of the
[1:17:26] flesh the propensities of our nature and
[1:17:29] we know that our nature is a fallen
[1:17:31] nature but God wants us to be
[1:17:33] spiritually minded to cater to the
[1:17:35] things of the word things of the Holy
[1:17:36] Ghost let God be able to speak to you
[1:17:38] through that still Small Voice so he can
[1:17:41] nudge you and you know that that's God
[1:17:44] you're not so consumed with the things
[1:17:46] of life and the Affairs of life that you
[1:17:48] miss the nudging of God Amen cuz I know
[1:17:53] just to be honest with you we all at
[1:17:55] some point in our walk have missed
[1:17:58] it and then Satan begins to work on your
[1:18:01] mind you missed it you missed a call of
[1:18:04] God you you should have prayed
[1:18:07] longer come
[1:18:09] on she would have just spent five more
[1:18:11] minutes 10 more minutes 30 more seconds
[1:18:15] if you have not given up God have done
[1:18:19] something see that's how he wants to get
[1:18:21] he wants to work on your carnality but
[1:18:23] see we our battle is not in the mind or
[1:18:26] it's not in the carnal the carnality of
[1:18:28] our mind but it's in our spirit realm
[1:18:30] Satan trying to defeat us and try to to
[1:18:32] bring us down and we find here in Romans
[1:18:34] 12:1 Paul would tell us I beseech you
[1:18:36] therefore Brethren by the mercies of God
[1:18:39] that you present your bodies as a Living
[1:18:41] Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[1:18:45] is your reasonable service and be not
[1:18:49] conformed and that word conformed there
[1:18:51] means to conform to the same
[1:18:53] pattern to be not conformed to the
[1:18:57] world but to be transformed
[1:19:01] metamorphosed right you come in like a
[1:19:05] caterpillar chewing around you know
[1:19:07] brother
[1:19:09] giy climbing up that
[1:19:12] tree walking out on that Branch just
[1:19:14] chewing away caterpillar but then you
[1:19:17] you settle in a place oh yeah you settle
[1:19:20] in Johnson City Tennessee start spending
[1:19:23] a cocoon in Word of Life
[1:19:26] JC and all of a sudden you've been there
[1:19:28] a year you've been there two years some
[1:19:31] of you been in that cocoon a long time
[1:19:34] you been you still in that cocoon but
[1:19:36] eventually what comes out of that cocoon
[1:19:38] is not the same thing that went in that
[1:19:40] cocoon oh a butterfly went in but a Son
[1:19:43] of God comes out a sinner comes in all
[1:19:46] tatted up drunk up Dred up but oh he
[1:19:49] been spun himself around the word of God
[1:19:51] and then got into a spiritual atmosphere
[1:19:54] and he comes out a beautiful creature he
[1:19:56] comes out a real Son of God where the
[1:19:58] things of the of the world the things of
[1:20:00] the flesh no longer have a pull on him
[1:20:02] no longer have a desire in his heart
[1:20:04] anymore no why because why he's a
[1:20:07] different creature he's been transformed
[1:20:09] by the word of God he's been metamorphed
[1:20:12] by the word he's been changed by the
[1:20:15] word
[1:20:16] church let me tell you I know what I'm
[1:20:18] talking about when I was 21 years old I
[1:20:20] was headed to a devil's hell and a sin
[1:20:22] is great oh but God rich in Mercy came
[1:20:25] down and he said turn your car around I
[1:20:29] was trying to kill
[1:20:31] myself but God said it don't have to
[1:20:33] hend that
[1:20:36] way I was out on all night drunk by 2:00
[1:20:39] in the morning spirit of God I wouldn't
[1:20:41] I didn't grow up in a church didn't grow
[1:20:42] up in a message Church didn't grow up in
[1:20:44] a BAP my family was on drugs and things
[1:20:46] like that let me tell you it was an
[1:20:49] awfulness but there was a seed
[1:20:51] planted
[1:20:53] I said there was a seed planted I didn't
[1:20:55] know about that seed I didn't know that
[1:20:58] I come from God oh but through the
[1:21:00] memory of my father he be to share with
[1:21:02] me where I came from where I'm going and
[1:21:04] he came down one night about 2:00 in the
[1:21:06] morning and he said turn your car around
[1:21:09] I turned my car around I went home and
[1:21:11] up beside my bed and gave my heart to
[1:21:13] God let me tell you I ain't never taking
[1:21:15] it back oh I'm a Child of God tonight

[1:21:43] Corinthians 2 verse4 but the natural man
[1:21:47] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[1:21:49] of God for they are foolishness unto him
[1:21:52] yes yeah neither can he know them
[1:21:54] because why they are spiritually
[1:21:58] discerned but he that is spiritual
[1:22:01] judges all things yet he himself is
[1:22:03] judged of no man for who have known the
[1:22:06] mind of the Lord that he may instruct
[1:22:08] him but

[1:37:46] tonight next
[1:37:48] slide how many know what this is I know
[1:37:51] you're
[1:37:52] intelligent it's a chess
[1:37:55] board how many know what the main piece
[1:37:57] on that board is what is
[1:38:00] it the king the king is the main piece
[1:38:05] on the
[1:38:07] board and let me just tell you your king
[1:38:10] is the main
[1:38:11] piece chess it's a game of
[1:38:14] wit it's where you make moves to get
[1:38:17] your opponent to make moves it's to
[1:38:19] where you have to out strategize
[1:38:22] manipulate your
[1:38:25] opponent and sometimes you may have to
[1:38:27] make sacrifices brother Joe you may have
[1:38:30] to lose one of your pieces so that you
[1:38:32] can get your opponent into a position
[1:38:36] that you can Checkmate
[1:38:38] him see there is a story next
[1:38:43] slide how many have ever seen this
[1:38:47] picture this is called
[1:38:50] checkmate we find here there was a
[1:38:52] there's a story this picture once hung
[1:38:55] in the Lou Museum in
[1:38:57] France and there was a one day there was
[1:39:00] a group of people coming by to look at
[1:39:02] the the the museum look at all the nice
[1:39:05] artifacts and all the artwork and and in
[1:39:08] this certain group there was a grandm an
[1:39:10] international chess
[1:39:12] champion he came in and he looked at the
[1:39:15] Mona Lisa and just passed it on by and
[1:39:17] he he looked here at this picture he was
[1:39:20] in International chess champion and he
[1:39:23] begin to
[1:39:24] study and we look at this picture here
[1:39:27] and we see that we have Satan here on
[1:39:30] the
[1:39:32] left but before that we have a chess
[1:39:34] board that's being played on a
[1:39:37] coffin cuz Satan is in battle for your
[1:39:40] soul and we have a king who looks for
[1:39:42] loone and lost and we have an angel
[1:39:44] looking over his shoulder it's like
[1:39:45] there's no hope they're in despair the
[1:39:49] young king is in checkmate that's what
[1:39:51] the picture is
[1:39:53] called so this
[1:39:55] painting we find that the legend has it
[1:39:59] this man stood and he looked at this
[1:40:00] painting and he studied this painting
[1:40:03] and he watched this painting and we find
[1:40:05] in this painting we have a lion here
[1:40:07] with his paw on a skull of the previous
[1:40:10] victim because there's no Escape so
[1:40:12] Satan thinks and we see this red feather
[1:40:15] in his cap which is an ancient emblem of
[1:40:18] craftiness and
[1:40:19] cunningness and you look at the pieces
[1:40:21] of Satan his pieces he is his own King
[1:40:26] his Queen is a voluptious woman his
[1:40:28] pieces are anger malice all these
[1:40:31] different Pride false H doubt and
[1:40:32] unbelief and we find the young man's
[1:40:35] pieces are peace love joy happiness
[1:40:37] goodness and all these
[1:40:39] pieces but when you look at this and you
[1:40:41] look at the pieces here Satan has a lot
[1:40:44] more pieces than the
[1:40:47] king there's a spider here who's made
[1:40:50] making its way to spin another web of
[1:40:53] snare for this young king to get his
[1:40:54] next victim so we look at all
[1:40:59] this and we see that Satan is after our
[1:41:04] soul right and every move you
[1:41:08] make plays into his hand and every move
[1:41:12] he
[1:41:13] makes can play into your hand so we find
[1:41:18] that we have we're in a we're in a chest
[1:41:21] chess match who's going to outsmart the
[1:41:24] next one they say that a a good chess
[1:41:26] player can make one move at a time one
[1:41:28] move ahead of a
[1:41:30] time or an average chess player can make
[1:41:32] one move ahead at a time a good chess
[1:41:34] player can make four to five moves ahead
[1:41:36] but a grandmas can make 20 moves ahead
[1:41:39] at a
[1:41:40] time so he knows you make this move then
[1:41:44] he's got these next 20 moves made and
[1:41:47] see that's how Satan does some of you
[1:41:49] get on that website and you make that
[1:41:51] move then he's got you boom b b b boom
[1:41:53] and now you're spiraling down a word of
[1:41:57] pornography or you go to make this move
[1:41:59] and you click on believe the sign all of
[1:42:01] a sudden now you're down this spiral
[1:42:02] Road of unbelief and that God sent a
[1:42:05] prophet and that this message is
[1:42:07] true so Satan's always trying to
[1:42:10] outsmart he's trying to always blur the
[1:42:12] lines of black and white and make
[1:42:14] everything gray things that we used to
[1:42:17] wouldn't allow in our house now they're
[1:42:19] welcomed music that we used to would not
[1:42:21] listen to now we listen to novels and
[1:42:26] books and magazines that we used to not
[1:42:27] want to look at now we just allow our
[1:42:30] kids to feed on them and look at them
[1:42:32] you know it's not hurting
[1:42:34] anybody so that's the thing see Satan is
[1:42:37] looking for
[1:42:39] weaknesses he's looking for
[1:42:41] weaknesses and if he can weaken Word of
[1:42:44] Life
[1:42:45] Church by getting you to not believe
[1:42:47] that he's still
[1:42:48] able that God's still able to to heal he
[1:42:52] finds that weakness he'll slip in there
[1:42:56] and he'll begin to manipulate that and
[1:42:58] he'll begin to bring this one down and
[1:43:00] that one down and that one down and that
[1:43:01] one down so we find Satan is always
[1:43:03] thinking
[1:43:05] ahead and he'll get you sometimes to
[1:43:07] make bad choices now how many of you
[1:43:10] ever made a bad choice yes sir all right
[1:43:11] praise God I'm in good company he'll
[1:43:14] make you make bad choices based on your
[1:43:16] feelings based on your complexes based
[1:43:19] on fears based on worries based on
[1:43:23] regrets based on past history family
[1:43:28] strains well this is who I am I just
[1:43:30] have to do this no you
[1:43:32] don't see Satan loves to do that and to
[1:43:35] back you in a
[1:43:37] corner but see we find the Bible says or
[1:43:40] as my wife sung that song the facts may
[1:43:42] be stacked up against
[1:43:44] you tonight you may be in a serious
[1:43:46] battle Satan's going backed you up and
[1:43:48] say well there's no hope for you there's
[1:43:50] there's no use of
[1:43:51] trying there's no use even believing for
[1:43:54] healing there's no use even believing
[1:43:56] for deliverance you got to be stuck that
[1:43:58] way this is who you are it's your
[1:44:01] makeup but the truth is he's already won
[1:44:05] the battle right see the facts may be
[1:44:07] stacked up against you but the truth is
[1:44:09] God's on your
[1:44:11] side see the truth is that it's not the
[1:44:14] end of the story God's the one with the
[1:44:17] pen in his hand and he told your Prophet
[1:44:20] pick up the pin and write yeah pick it
[1:44:22] up this is what I want you to tell my
[1:44:25] bride that she's a lovely
[1:44:28] woman oh Church to let you know where
[1:44:31] you come from cuz he knew you would need
[1:44:34] a message like this in this hour when
[1:44:36] all Hells are selling you you can come
[1:44:38] back to this word and it'll be your
[1:44:40] anchor so as we find the facts is that
[1:44:43] we're troubled on every side but the
[1:44:45] truth is we're not
[1:44:47] distressed facts is that we're perplexed
[1:44:50] sometimes we we don't know which way to
[1:44:51] go but the truth is we're not in
[1:44:53] despair the facts is we're persecuted
[1:44:56] but the truth is we're not forsaken the
[1:44:59] facts are that we're cast down and many
[1:45:00] of us been cast down many of time but
[1:45:02] the truth is we're not destroyed we're
[1:45:05] still here Church we're still believing
[1:45:07] we're still plugging along law let me
[1:45:09] just tell you this when the devil is all
[1:45:12] gone and he's defeated you'll still be
[1:45:14] standing you'll still be here when when
[1:45:17] that healing has happened and Satan is
[1:45:19] defeated he's cast into that Lake of
[1:45:20] Fire we'll still be worshiping we'll
[1:45:23] still be praising God what did God tell
[1:45:25] job job where were you when I hung the
[1:45:27] foundations of the world where were you
