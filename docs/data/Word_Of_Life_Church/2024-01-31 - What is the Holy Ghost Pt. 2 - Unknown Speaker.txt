know how to use these you know why cuz I'm a pastor got praise the Lord what an awesome gift from God let's just bow our heads together Heavenly Father father we're so grateful Lord what a great thing life is as I stand here tonight Lord with this great gift from almighty God and I wonder how many today in our nation so the statistics say one baby every 24 seconds is aborted but this brother and sister desired to bring a child child into the Earth to be able to teach it train it to be able to take it with them when they go to heaven Lord God they bring it now back to you asking you father that you'd take his little life if little Hudson would get old enough to be able to make his choice may his choice be soon while his heart is tender father I pray for my sister being the Fifth Gospel that ual helper to be able to let him see Jesus and Mama and my brother let him see Jesus and daddy keep him from the evils of the day sicknesses diseases things that are so rampant in this hour we dedicate his little life to you father for a life of service in the name of Jesus amen yeah he knows how to do that don't he ni praise the Lord let's stand together let's turn tonight if you would to First Peter chapter 1 verse 10 I'm he happy to be in the house of the Lord privilege for us is it to be able to come together to serve God to be able to live for him in this day of such Darkness such terrible terrible time that's around the world and yet God by his Mercy has called us to himself we're so grateful for that I want to speak to you again tonight on what is the Holy Ghost we'll read the scriptures that we read last Wednesday night from here in Peter of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied side of the grace that should come unto you I want you notice what they did now they prophesied of the grace which should come unto you so what is prophecy prophecy is telling something in the future a future event by divine inspiration most of the times the prophets of the Old Testament were saying things it was not even written in the Bible it became written after they spoke it that's what prophecy actually is so who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify so they were looking searching trying to understand when will it be we know it's coming we know it's coming it's the word of the Lord when is it but they couldn't understand the time frame when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did Minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the Angels desire to look into let's read the meaning of the word again look to stoop to a thing in order to look at so you're stooping so the angels of God looking and peering into this to look at with head bowed for forward to look into with the body bent to stoop and look into metaphorically to look carefully into inspect curiously of one who would become acquainted with something Angels which would become acquainted with your walk with God your experience God's grace to you and it's so profound to them that they just bend over and look at it trying to understand it and we let the devil beat the Daylights out of us trying to tell us we ain't got nothing I wonder if the angels of God could pass through this place tonight and scream and holler to the top of their voice and say do you all know what you have do you realize what you have and they study us and look at us and stoop over to try to understand may God help us tonight and may can raise your hands Lord I need my eyes open in a greater way amen me too let's bow our heads together we'll pray over this prayer Closs tonight for brother Bernie young is having surgery this week we want to just pray for our brother everything will will go well father as we bow our heads not to peer or to look into something but Lord God to the dust of the Earth from once our bodies were taken with Thanksgiving in our heart that we hold within our souls tonight a possession of such great value that the Holy Angels of God look into it and would desire to understand it Greater we come before you tonight father asking you that you'd be mindful of all the needs of your children the sick the weary The Afflicted those that need a touch in their home maybe in their finances whatever it is Father Lord for this prayer clause and I going to preach with tonight I pray that you'd be mindful of brother Bernie Lord may this surgery go well be no evil report that'll come of it father we commit ourselves to you tonight we ask you that you'd come and anoint not only the speaker but anoint the hearers that we can be benefited by gathering together tonight father in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it and Saints said am God bless you you may be seated tonight Thursday night whenever I did the question answers with the youth and I'm sure they've already announced it we'll be having another one again tomorrow night Lord willing but I went this way these few scriptures that we're going to look at for just a few moments on uh the spirit of Truth what the Holy Ghost um really is and we know that John set it forth that there was a spirit of Truth and there was a spirit of error and many people think because they get truth they might pack a Bible they might read the Bible they believe it intellectually some of the message people they think because they listen to tapes and they read the books and they have a a fairly good knowledge and understanding of the message and they think well I I I believe the message so that means I've got the Holy Ghost but yet we know that we could have a portion of truth and not have the spirit of Truth Now Jesus divides the spirit of truth from truth so if he divided the spirit of truth from truth then that helps me to see that John puts it in in two categories that there's a spirit of Truth and there's a spirit of error so there's also truth and error and most of us probably are sitting here tonight there's things that we believe that may actually makes it be wrong and we believe it because we don't know any better but if someone shows us in the scripture or in the message that we're believing something wrong if we're a real child of God and we have the spirit of Truth in us then that error can be corrected because we have the spirit of Truth or you saying now now now brother Donnie if you'll show people that it's the truth they'll be corrected no I'll tell you they won't because I've showed many people down through my years in the ministry of things they were wrong in things they were believing wrong things they were doing wrong and show them over and over and over again and they still would not accept it even though they said they believed the truth so you think how could that be because there's a difference in the spirit of truth and truth and there's a difference in error and the spirit of error now if a person is actually under the spirit of error you can show them the truths page after page quote after quote scripture after scripture whatever it is and if they're under the spirit of error they will process that truth under that anointing of that spirit and it will explain it to them and they will in turn explain it away or make an excuse why they can't do it now that's a person operating under the spirit of ER so they hear truths truths truths more truths and the truths actually doesn't make them free because they're under the spirit of error so the Holy Ghost this is one thing that he's going to be he's a comforter he's a seal he's peace he's Joy he's all of these things but Jesus wants us to know now listen carefully what he says here in St John 14:1 16 I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth Now notice he doesn't say even the truth but the spirit of Truth now this is why people can embrace the truth for a while sometimes people will come to the truth you know for many many years and then all of a sudden they fall away and you saying how in the world could that have happened because the truth was up here and never down here by Revelation so not only did they miss a revelation of understanding the furtherance of that truth but they miss the spirit of truth because the spirit of Truth abiding in us will never allow us to remain in error no absolutely impossible now you may be as I said sitting here tonight believing something wrong but God will make sure that he straightens us out before we leave this world world because the Holy Ghost in us will lead and guide us into a all truths so it's not enough just to believe in one God it's not enough just to have well I've got a great portion of Truth the Holy Ghost will lead us into all the truths of the age that we live in now notice Jesus says even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive now once again this proves that a person that's a sinner coming here tonight and we might make an altar call and they may bow here on their knees and say Lord Jesus uh receive me I ask you to forgive me of my sins that person cannot receive the Holy Ghost they receive the spirit of God in the form of justification by Fai now remember God's typing it through the church ages so lucer had a portion of the spirit of God Wesley had a portion Pentecost had a greater portion we by God's grace have a greater portion than them is that right so whenever a person then comes to the Lord they are just repenting of their sins but they're still not a candidate to be able to receive the fullness of the spirit of God they may still smoke they may drink they may have filthy habits you know what they've got to do they've got to be Sanctified before the Holy Ghost will ever come and seal their soul is that right now notice Jesus said even the spirit of truth of whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him well that's a sad thing about it today as well because they don't know him they don't know him in the attribute of receiving him as the Holy Ghost because many of the churches teach them today once they receive Christ as their savior they're born again they got eternal life they got everything they need that's a lie I said that's a lie you're not truly converted Ed until you receive the Holy Ghost you're Justified Sanctified then you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost which seals your soul until the day of redemption now notice he says for he said but ye know him for he dwelleth with you Lord have mercy what's Jesus saying you know him for he dwelleth with you notice he doesn't say in you now who's he talking about himself so who's it going to be him himself and another attribute of the godhead which can be divided Jesus in sunship form could not have been divided to come back on the day of Pentecost but Jesus in the form of the Son of God not son of man remember he identified himself as son of man which was a prophet to Israel but he further identifies himself in the church ages as Son of God what is God a spirit what is is the Son of God baptism of the Holy Ghost the divisive part of God which can be divided into many many many parts of the spirit of God living in human hearts around the world now Jesus said they don't know him but you all know him you imagine them looking around one another and said we don't know him he said yes you do you do know him because he's dwelling with you you never imagine they didn't have the Holy Ghost so they're trying to figure out what in the world is he talking about notice he goes on to say I will not leave you comfortless now it would seem as if though in verse 17 that Jesus is speaking about the father giving another being separate from himself but then he goes down in verse 18 and lets them know hey boys it's me in another form it ain't another God it ain't the third person of the godhead it's me in a changed condescended form oh don't you love the truth of God's word I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you oh I'm so glad that he has aren't you St John 15:26 but when the comforter is come now notice again how he says this whom I will send unto you from the father now you IM their s there shaking their head said a while ago he said the father is going to send it and then he said it was him now he's sing like he sending it from the father who in the world is all this they really needed the Holy Ghost to understand this didn't they whom I will send unto you from the father even the spirit of Truth Now please don't misunderstand me it's easier to get the truth than it is the spirit yes sir of Tru truth somebody can drop a book on your door somebody could leave a Bible The Gideons do it all the time they could leave a a Bible in a hotel room and you could be sitting there one night and you're all sad and Lon and depressed and you pick up that bible and you read maybe John 3:16 you know somewhere where it talks about salvation and you receive the truth and you say God I'm so sorry please forgive me and you receive that truth it does not mean that you receive the Holy Ghost which is the spirit of Truth when you repented you receive that portion of the spirit of God which John 316 would allow you to have but there's more to that now watch he said when the comforters come whom I will send unto you from the father even the spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me St John 16:12 I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come listen what he's going to do he will guide you into just a little bit of Truth and then once you get that little bit of Truth you never have to read your Bible again and you'll never have to study no more and that's all you'll ever get well that's what people believe that's what they think they can do and they spend more time you know reading this magazine or that magazine or doing this and that and the other than they do trying to find the way of Salvation because they think once they get saved they know it all right there well I hate to be the one to bust your balloon tonight but you just barely got started how's been saved here for many many years and you could say sometimes I feel like I just got started myself now watch he said how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you in into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come now what will the Holy Ghost do in me and you what will the Holy Ghost do now this comes back to the first question that I answered the other night about how will I know I've got the Holy Ghost well this is some of the things that the Holy Ghost will do do in us he will guide us into all truth he will Comfort us he will show us things to come why because the holy spirit is the very access into future events and he will show you things to come 1 John 4: 6 we are of God he that knoweth God heareth us he that is not of God heareth us not hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error so there is truth and there is error there is Spirit of Truth and spirit of error I don't mind telling you there's been times in my life that I have not only believed error but I was under the spirit of error whenever I was a trinitarian there was people that tried to talk to me and show me things in the Bible about one God and water baptism it didn't make no difference how many scripture they showed me it didn't move me at all I'm not saying that tonight to be proud of it I say that because it's a shame because I was under a spirit of error anybody else in the building honest enough tonight to say you've been under the spirit of error too and people would show you truth and you'd look right at it and read it from the Bible and you still wouldn't receive it but is't it wonderful you receive it tonight why God was able to remove that Spirit off of you and then the very things that you read before that you didn't see and understand it's like all of a sudden your eyes just came open now what happened it what what it was more truth no it was not so much necessarily that it was more truth sometimes it's the exact same amount of truth that was shown to you before but the spirit of error was driven away from you now let me say this to you that we can be under the spirit of error about lots of things it's not just doctrinally we can get in our mind that someone doesn't like us and what is that many times it's a spirit of error we can get in our mind that when the preacher's preaching he's looking right at me oh my goodness and I I just know he's just preaching that for me only somebody's been talking to brother Donnie and you know what a person can get under that Spirit of error and they'll be totally convinced I could sit and talk to them and tell them brother sister I'm not out against you I ain't got nothing against you but until they would let God deliver them of that Spirit of error they won't believe me a bit more than nothing or you or anyone else so the spirit of error is quite a broad spectrum it would probably scare most of us if we knew how many times we have been under Spirit of PR what do you mean Brother D well error is a falsehood so it's something that you disbelieve about God's word it can also be something that you disbelieve about one of God's children or one of God's men and it's so real to you yet in reality it cannot be proven that this man of God done that or was out to get you but you're totally convinced now what what the spirit of God in us will do are we still subject to being in error and making making mistakes actually we get the Holy Ghost yes we are that's part of our growth that's part of our maturity in the Lord Jesus and our Humanity will bother us as long as we're here but the more submitted we get to him and the more we surrender than to me I I believe in Repentance I thank God for his blood don't you I thank God for his Mercy that I can go but when I look at the Covenant of God if the mercy of God is there to forgive me whenever I do wrong cannot the wisdom and the strength of God in the Holy Ghost cannot he and I become closer and closer and that he can actually stop me from doing wrong cannot the spirit of God in Me lead me away from a trap if the Holy Ghost knows that the devil's got a trap laid for me cannot the Holy Ghost say go around that bypass that amen cannot the spirit of God how many knows he's done that for you and your life well if the Holy Ghost in us can lead us into all truths and and can be able to show us things that are going to come can he show us a pitfalls cannot he show us a mistakes in our life am I preaching to you that you'll never make another one no but I'll tell you one thing I'd be a mighty happy Pastor if in a few weeks time some of you would send me a text or an email and said brother Donnie you know what I I I embrace that truth of what you said there on that Wednesday I and God has been helping me and I've been averting this Pitfall I've been avoiding ing this I've been avoiding that wouldn't that be a wonderful testimony as a child of God not sure if you've got to repent the blood is there for it but why would we want to keep on fallowing the same thing over and over up and down and up and down and repenting and repent and repenting for the same thing over and over again when the spirit of Truth living inside of us can Empower us to say wait a minute he's got a trap set for you he's got a snare laid for you he's got this laid for you don't do that don't go that way amen is that what you want as a child of God to me that's an overcoming child of God now let's let's change a little bit and see what does the Holy Ghost then do inside of Holy Ghost filled Believers what what benefit really is it now I know there's an element of preachers in the message that preach believe it or not that whenever you actually accept Christ as your savior they still teach that you're born again that you are actually born again again when you repent but we know of course to the end of the prophet's Ministry that that's not what he taught that you are not fully even fully converted until you receive the Holy Ghost so they simply teach in that aspect that what happens to you is that you're born again whenever you accept the Lord and then if you receive the Holy Ghost all it does is give you a little bit of power to be able to empower you to do this and that and the other but I'm going to tell you one thing according to the Bible in Acts chap 1:8 you shall receive dunamus after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you so it's more than just a little bit of power it is God let me tell you tonight what the Holy Ghost is it's God let me tell you what it is not the Holy Ghost is not emotion the Holy Ghost is not jumping it is not shouting the Holy Ghost is not tongue now listen carefully before you get tied on me the Holy Ghost is not s the Holy Ghost produces sensation the Holy Ghost produces shouting but if I'm going to say the Holy Ghost is tongues then what I'm saying is God is tongues my God is more than tongues my God causes emotion my God causes sensation but my God is more than emotion my God is not an emotion praise the Lord so what then does the Holy Ghost do do in the recipients of this new life look at Mark 13:1 but when they shall lead you and deliver you up now Jesus talking about in the time of persecution the disciples are going to be persecuted for the cause of Christ and also would we now he's telling them what would happen once you get in these Straits take no thought beforehand what you shall speak neither do you premeditate but whatsoever shall be whatsoever shall be given unto you in that hour that speaky for it is not ye that speak but the Holy Ghost so he's talking about then one thing that the Holy Ghost would do is whenever you're brought before rulers magistrates maybe even on your job or whatever it is people that would question what you believe what you stand for then he says with the Holy Ghost Inside of You the Holy Ghost will give you the the words to say so this is one thing that the Holy Ghost will do inside of us I'm sure many of you have experienced that when you didn't know what to say and then all of a sudden something from within you just started answering and you were totally surprised yourself is that right well that's the holy ghost that does that notice again in Luke 12:2 for the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour now this is Luke catching this is Luke's rendition of the same thing that Mark wrote and Luke wrote it just a little bit different for the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what you ought to say like you can imagine the spirit of God could have given you a week before why would he wait to the very hour you need it a't that amazing how God does that sometimes he loves to get us to a spot to where we're right on the brck of putting our foot in the Red Sea and then he comes on the scene so he could have given it to you a week before a day before a month before but instead he gives it to you that very hour he likes to keep his children under pressure sometimes St John 1426 but the comfort of which is the Holy Ghost whom the father was sent in my name he shall teach you again all things and bring all things to your remembrance now how do you figure Matthew Mark Luke and John was written Matthew was not written when Jesus was here Mark was not written when Jesus was here Luke was not written Luke was not even one of the original chosen disciples John was not written when Jesus was here so how did they recall all the Miracles how did they they recall the things that were said and the words that were said and the instances that were said when their gospels weren't written until some of them 30 and 40 years after Jesus had left how many of y'all trust them gospels with all your heart so you know what you're trusted you're trusting men that were filled with the Holy Ghost and they were set the writing and the Holy Ghost brought it back to their remembrance praise be to God every time you pick up your New Testament and you read one of those four gospels you are reading the Fulfillment of this scripture not on only you but God still does the same thing Carol tells me all the time Donnie I wish sometimes that people could sit and hear the private interviews and just how the Lord will give you the things to say I said I know I I'm I'm just absolutely overwhelmed myself because the spirit of God will lead me down Avenues and say I haven't studied on a certain subject for for maybe months and months or maybe even years and I'll get in the channel same anointing out here but in a little different Channel and I'll get under that channel and I'll go to quoting scriptures and it comes out of there and I say where in the world does all of that come from and quotes that I am quoted in years and God will just lay that out of there and I've seen him set people free by that word I've seen the devil crawl out beat and bruised black and blue and it wasn't because I premeditated it I didn't even think about it I didn't remember it and yet the Holy Ghost will come and it will lay it out there so perfectly that it it just mesmerizes me well you say why would it do you cuz it ain't me doing it that's why it's the spirit of God anointing the gift in my life but also anointing my memory and recalling things that I might not have quoted for years and yet what is it as I sat there I'm fulfilling what Jesus said again just way some of you will maybe not as many times but when you don't even know how to answer what to say and all of a sudden the scripture will pop into your mind maybe you haven't thought about it for months or maybe even years before what is that that's what the Holy Ghost wants to do inside of every one of us now notice Jesus said he will bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have second you imagine now Matthew years and years later and he was setting down now the Gospel of Jesus Christ is on this wise and then he would go to take a Matthew took it from one angle mark from another angle Luke from another angle of course one of Son of God Son of Man the Incarnate Word every one of them and the spirit of God brought to their remembrance different aspects of the exact same story and would bring to Matthew while have four gospels if they're all going to say exactly the same thing and tell the exact same story in the same way you don't need one and yet every one of them wrote it a little bit different so the Holy Ghost captivated Matthew and opened up his remembrance to certain things and Mark he didn't Mark only wrote 16 chapters did you know it's the shortest one of the four gospels and yet Mark's recall was totally different and Luke's recall was totally different and where did Luke get his he wasn't even there when Jesus said it but Luke traveled around with Paul remember Luke was a physician he was a Jew but he was of Greek upbringing very intellectual a man of great wisdom and also a great understanding so Luke went around remember he traveled with this preacher that got through throwed in jail all the time how would you like that to be your pastor and God throw in jail all the time so Luke had a lot of spare time on his hands so history tells us that Luke would go around so when they would come into capernium when they would come into Cyprus when they'd come into these different places and Luke go around say is there anybody here that knows about Jesus is there anybody here that was in the meetings of Jesus what he get with them and he write down their their stories oh my and then what was it the Holy Ghost on them years after it had happened and the holy ghost coming on this woman coming on this man and Luke said you got any more have you got any more tell me more look do you understand how your new testament was written do you think it's just a bunch of men that done it the Holy Ghost wrote the New Testament it was the spirit of truth and the same Holy Ghost is what it's going to take to help us understand it now notice Jesus before he ascends up into heaven acts 1:7 and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times of the seasons which a father has put in his own power but you shall receive dunamus power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you I know you know the meaning of this word I've shared it with you for so many years but let's look at it again inherent power now remember this is different than exusia exusia is an authority given to you but it's not something that is yours it's not something that lives in you it's like a State Trooper or a magistrate or a police or a mayor or a governor he's voted in or he's hired or he's appointed he loses his job he loses his power he loses his authority but Jesus did not want the New Testament Church to be built upon excuse you that's what the apostles had that's the way they cast out Devils so it might help you to understand how you say how in the world brother Donnie could could Judas cast out Devils because he had excused IIA written as we'd say written Authority in this day by the law of St Tri said you see somebody speeding we give you the authority to pull them over we give you the authority to check the driver's license ask for their insurance card we give you that Authority it's written in our law you've got that job you can do it so here Judas was sent out under the power of exusia it was a delegated authority not an inherit nature but Jesus did not want to build bu his church on a delegated authority but he wanted to build it on an inherit nature an inherit power power residing In A Thing by virtue of its nature or which a person or thing exerts and puts forth moral power and Excellence of Soul so Judas didn't have this no sir he had what Matthew 10 go preach he was hard for the job he was hard you understand so he was given excuse him so he went out cast out Devils healed the sick preached he was not inferior to the rest of them he done exactly the same stuff they did on what what basis on excuse him but you don't find Judah showing up on the day of Pentecost now notice Jesus says you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me in Jerusalem and all Judea and in Samaria here we go now Beyond them and unto the uttermost part of the earth Romans chap 14:1 17 for the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and in the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost don't just show you things to come and give you the right things to say at the right time but the Holy Ghost is joy and peace and righteousness how many feels like you might need another dose of that tonight oh my Romans 15:13 now the God of Peace fill you with all joy and peace in believing that you may abound in Hope through the the power of the Holy Ghost through the power of the Holy Ghost I know we're living in the last day and I know we're living in difficult times but I still believe as one child of God there's joy in the Holy Ghost amen I believe there's power in the Holy Ghost anybody else here with me tonight believe that there's joy unspeakable and full of Glory I believe a person I know you going to say I'm crazy I believe a person can be so full of the Holy Ghost they can still shout they can still dance I believe a child of God can get so full of the Holy Ghost they could be drunk on the spirit of God [Applause] Amen I realize some of y'all are so drunk you're about the stage of passing out you know you're just so so drunk I believe you can get so drunk that the prophet said you don't even know what your name is the D 2024 I know that I realize that but I've not found where on any of these scriptures that it gave a time limit that it said well up to 1989 up to 1995 up to 2024 I'm not found that there's no end to it if the Holy Ghost cannot be Joy tonight then somehow I figure I got cheated I must have got a watered down version that is not the same thing that Peter and them have because they were beat they were whipped and whenever they come to their s they was rejoicing and shouting and praising God that they had been counted worthy to be beat for his name well praise the Lord notice now let's let's look a little bit in the direction of the message if you don't mind the prophet said the Holy Ghost in you has to Bear record to the resurrection and Jesus being the Son of God now watch now the personal identification in you as an individual not not us as a church not you and your family but you as an individual is the Holy Ghost in you will have a personal Vindication of the resurrection and that Jesus is the son of God or you're only taking somebody else's word for it you're only taking what the Bible says and he said the Bible's right and you're only taking what the minister says but you see you can take what the Bible says here intellectually faith and still not be a Vindication in your own life brother joh what you saying what do you mean it means you have raised from the dead because you have received the resurrection power in you you're not the same person you're not living the same way you're not acting the same way you're not talking the same way you yourself are a proof that Calvary was a success because you lived a life in sin and darkness of the world but now you have raised from the dead I don't to make a Baptist want to shout now watch's this what was the Holy Ghost given for God wants to bring the Holy Ghost In You to continue the same work that he was doing in Christ well then we've got to believe that God still wants to do them same works right what did he do when he was here did Jesus just go around say I tell you what we're going to start a church and uh we we just want to bring everybody in and just y'all y'all believe I'm the Son of God y y'all believe that I come to save you from your sins uh and and we won't we won't do no signs now and allone that sort of thing and we won't preach hard we won't preach on nobody was that what Jesus said is that the way jesus carried it out no it wasn't and it wasn't the way his Apostles carried it out so we got identify then what was the works that he done what he told us these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they'll speak with with new tongues they'll heal the sick right so the Holy Ghost come back in me and you so brother Dar is that mean then that every man every woman every boy and every girl is is going to do the same thing as preachers no we know that already we've done been through that for years and years and you know that everyone is not going to do the exact same sign if you'll study your Bible real close you will find out there was certain Apostles that did more signs than the others now I know which one it is but I ain't going to tell you some of Y all tanking lazy right now you don't think you have to pick up your Bible oh my so I ain't going to spoil you no more I know the answer but I want you to look it up oh brother D I'll have to take away from my YouTube tutorials well you might ought to God go to God tube in his tutorials of how to get out of here for a rapture praise the Lord oh brother Donnie but my Snapchat and my Instagram and my Tik Tok I'm telling you there's a Tik Tok and it was 3 Minutes to Midnight years ago and the clock is Tick Tock and we're a whole lot closer now so if you want to go in a Rapture you better be feeding on the word not Instagram and Tik Tok praise the Lord Brother Dy preach it brother I'm with you glory to God brother Amen brother Donnie Hallelujah brother Donnie amen I love the way brother Ram deals with this he said now the work wasn't so needy in the days of lucer that was God's church he says but it wasn't but a little bit more needer in the days of Wesley because the world the Bible said it would get weaker and wiser and the more wicked all the time and the world is getting more wicked can you imagine this is 1959 when he said this what would he say now men do things today that a hundred years ago you wouldn't have thought that been a human being that cruel and they're more wicked all the time and the wicked do wickeder now you might not find that at the University of some you know great speaker but it's Kentuck in case you didn't know it the wicked are more wickeder and the sorry are more sorer and the rottener more rottener everybody understand that plain English the wicked shall be more wickeder all the time said the scripture more and more so the Holy Spirit has been moving now listen there was just a little breath of it was looser and a little blow of it with Wesley and a deeper blow with Pentecost now the breath and the spirit GL to God now the breath and the spirit has become the same she's uniting together bringing forth that same powerful blow of the Holy Ghost like he did back there is manifesting the same works that he did back there manifested right today the same thing praise be to God we're on I'm on a Minister's chat brother now was telling about four church and there was a brother from the Philippines had went and preached in a certain Island there was a woman there in the hospital that had had a major stroke and know it was awful the the the shape that it left the woman in but someone had called for the preacher to come there m his brother preached the word for years so he goes out of that place and that hospital and prays for her and God does such Supernatural miracle in the life of that woman that he had a picture and he post posted it on this thing today and he showed the woman laying there in the bed worshiping and praising God after the miraculous power of God had come down in the room and the next day her daughter which was there in the room when the miracle took place her daughter come back and said I want to give my heart to God I want to be baptized I want to be baptized don't you understand that's what Divine Healing is it's a bait on the hook so you don't you don't let the fish see the hook you let the fish see the bait so then you put it on there and you show it out and they see a supernatural God moving Among Us and they'll say that's a kind of God I want that's the kind of God I'll serve a God that can heal the sick a God that can save Sinners of God that can take a man and turn him from being a drunk and a liar and a wher and fill him of the Holy Ghost and set him on the gospel way I'll serve a god like that that's the kind of God we want in our church that that's the kind of God we have in our church hallelujah hallelujah now notice how the intensity of this goes with a little breath from a breath to a little blow from that to a deeper blow and then the breast and the spirit become the same youting bringing forth that same powerful blow of the Holy Ghost like like he did back then manifesting the same Works he did back there is being manifested right today the same thing oh praise the Lord if you've got the Holy Ghost in you you will follow his instructions amen if we've got the Holy Ghost in us we will follow his instructions regardless of what the people say about you well if he tells you to be baptized in jesus' name but what will my grandma say what will my mama say what will my daddy say that's not what you're going by if you've got the Holy Ghost you belong to Jesus well you mean I've got to let my hair go out and the men why the men can't you know they can't let their girl out long look like a woman and they can't go around with earrings suuck in their ears and you know they can't do the oh what's my buddies at work going to say what's so and so going to say what's my best friend going to say what are you worried about you going to stand before your best friend the day of judgment or you going to stand before God but if you really get the Holy Ghost you want to obey his instructions amen amen that that absolutely involves how to walk how to talk how to dress how to live how to love amen it will involve all of his instructions praise be to God notice this he said if you haven't got the Holy Ghost in you how can you take God's word the Holy Ghost in you will say Amen how many all you may not just your favorite ones a the Holy Ghost will say Amen to every word even when the flesh says ouch y'all ouch and amen at the same time oh sure you do your old flesh oo o boy that burn ooh that stung ah ah ah oh oh and the soul is saying Glory Glory shut up body shut up flesh get out of my way let me Rejoice praise the Lord our souls ought to be rejoicing tonight because we can say Amen to God's word now your body may be say oh goodness oh goodness that hurts me oh what am I going to have to give up what are you going to have to give up my Lord what in the world oh we talking about what little bit could god require of us that would ever pay to live in eternity with a great being like this where you will never die where you will never age you will never get sick can you imagine what people would pay today what billionaires would pay if they could get a spoonful or this bottle right here full of eternal life and they would drink some of that punch Deon searched and searched and searched he looked all over Florida he looked up and down everywhere found it all kinds of people who look for eternal life but I'll tell you it wasn't in Florida it was not in the Egyptian tombs but it hung upon a cross and the blood cell was broke open that it might re oh Hallelujah release eternal life thank God we have it tonight thank God we have it people have S and looked how to live forever and we have it we had it I was reading just a few weeks ago about a billionaire and he's convinced that he's found the way that he can live forever so all these you know these projects and all these multivitamin my Lord we've had enough pyramid schemes in the in the message here we could look like Giza giz is where the pyramids are in Egypt you know oh my this this this be Pro and and this vitamin C it's not regular vitamin C though it's supercharged my you know all this um yucka and yucka I I agree with that yucka yucka uhhuh yucka this and yuck of that come on now somebody why we want to live better don't we well I do too I want to live a healthier life if I can do it my goodness we've spent enough money on some of this stuff that we could obade they tell them how many churches we could have build overseas by trying to prolong our life brother Doug MC used to tell me years ago brother Donnie I'll tell you one thing all these people won't eat sugar and they won't eat chocolate and this and that and the other and why up stepping out in front of a car and get run over he said so I'm going to go ahead and eat mine and pray over it why something in us we don't want to die we don't want to get old you think I want to get old Lord have mercy I don't think you want to get old brother Paul you don't think you never will but the Lord tell you buddy I'm telling you you're going to whoever thought would ever look this way Whoever thought our hair would turn loose and some of it turned gray Whoever thought would be here in 2024 we want to live I'm telling you tonight what you can do to live forever not another 10 years not another 15 years but you'll never die praise God the holy ghost in you is the token that brings you from the grave it brings you from the grave some will be brought twice they'll be brought spiritually from the grave of sin and go by the way of the grave of of course and experience the resurrection Jesus said there would be some that would go to the resurrection as a matter of fact he gave them a particular name and he calls them children of the Resurrection Children of the Resurrection well I don't know if that's my lot or not but I figure there's only one of two things things I can be called a child of the Resurrection or a child of the change don't really matter to me I'm a winner either way some of our loved ones some of our friends have been committed to be Children of the Resurrection oh I know we grieve and we're so sad for their departure but let me tell you one thing that God had on us in one way I said they've got it on us in one way they're there in the presence of God tonight rejoicing and praising God no more sadness no more sorrow not only that they beat us up praise God they beat us up they will arise first and we'll look around some morning and see them standing there in our room and we know it won't be long we are going to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye Children of the Resurrection you see the token is required in order to be accepted in the first resurrection that's why Paul said we sorrow not as others who have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again then what sleep in Jesus will God bring with him can you imagine saying brother Jim B my daughter Erica your loved ones and Friends when the Lord Jesus comes back he's going to bring Erica with him when Jesus comes back he's going to bring brother Jim bad with him that's right he will bring with him when he comes Hallelujah that they stand around him and he will say you are my proof you are my proof I did not die in vain go get your [Applause] family Hallelujah if y'all wouldn't here tonight I just shout a spell h Hallelujah notice in Romans 8:7 because a carnal mind is enity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit now he's not saying that the Roman Christians are out of their body but he's pointing them back to a time that the enmity not only rule their flesh it rule their soul you understand you was at war with God before you got saved you were at war with God but once you received the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ waved the Peace Flag and made a union in between you and God and the war has been settled forever God was on one side you was on another the Lord Jesus bridged the gap between God the Eternal and man a time being stood there in the middle and brought them both together so God and man can meet in Christ Jesus Oh Glory to God friends that's as simple as I know how to put the Plan of Redemption and in you in you the Plan of Redemption is made manifest and you have that peace between you and God you're no more at war with him you're not fighting him you're not against his will you're not against his program you're at peace with God praise God but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be the spirit of God dwell in you we are his Temple now if any man have not the spirit of Christ notice he doesn't say have his Bible quot the scriptures but you got to have his Spirit which is what Holy Ghost verse 11 if the spirit of him now this is one of my favorite scriptures and I was a Pentecostal preacher Romans 8:11 if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies and that was the scripture that we used for shouting right brother Melvin right brother Emanuel so the spirit of God comes on you it'll Quicken your mortal body Hallelujah glory to God here we go oh Hallelujah but when you look at what Paul is saying he's talking about those of us that were dead in sin and Christ the Holy Ghost resurrected us and changed us and he will also Quicken our mortal body think of it in a moment in a twinkling of an eye you'll be changed oh praise the Lord 1 Corinthians 6:19 what know ye not that your body is a temple how many of you would come in this place bring coffee Donuts your lunch your supper how many of you would come in here and get up on the platform or sit there in the chairs and go to telling you know questionable jokes things like that oh no Lord have mercy no I would never do that you won't do it in this house well what about this one so unlike to Heathen we don't pack an idol around in our arm we pack our guard around in our heart and we are his place of worship this is why I don't have to wait to be in church to worship God I worship him every day of my life off and on all day even in the night if I wake up in the night and if I wake up early in the morning which I do a lot on the first things comes out of my mouth is praise and worship to my Lord because I my body is his Temple and from the temple of God I can be able to give him sacrificial worship and praise whether I feel like it or not that has absolutely nothing to do with it and because my life has been touched by the original fire of God I will not be slain the way Aaron's two sons were you see Aaron's two sons on the very first day of Aaron's Service as being the high priest they go and offer Strange Fire before the Lord now what they did was according to the law of God they were supposed to everything that they did was supposed to come from the original lighting of fire off of the altar of God which was lit supernaturally so the spirit of God come down and lit that and every fire they built from that day on was supposed to be built from that original lighting of fire but Aaron's sons they got in there and the Bible says they offered Strange Fire before the Lord so their fire did not come from the original lighting look it up in the Hebrew Su it did not come from the original lighting Satan has had strange fire in every age it looks like fire it burns like fire it can consume like fire but where did it come from and God killed both of those men because they had the wrong fire look children I want us to be on fire with the Holy Ghost but I want to make sure what's lighting us up is from the original lighting come on somebody oh we're too close we're too close we want to make sure oh but it looks like fire it burns like fire it feels like fire it warms it stirs you you can feel it oh yeah yeah fire will burn you the wrong fire could have burnt them but it come from the wrong place so when you as a worshipper of God receive the Holy Ghost and your Nature has been annihilated then from the temple within you your soul you are offering from the original altar of God and from the original fire you've got the same Holy Ghost Peter had so you're standing in lows you're in Food City you're you know at a pond fishing somewhere what whatever you're doing you can raise your hands right there where you are and you're not offering Strange Fire Baptist fire Methodist fire you know whatever kind of fire but you've got the same fire that Peter had on the day of Pentecost and you can worship God and God will accept you standing out beside a creek God would accept you standing out you know Gathering your cows for milk and them or whatever more just the same way he would standing right here in this church building is that right why because you have become the temple of God and fire of God when we dedicated this place I didn't see that fire burning on the fuse oh some people seen the pillar of fire Angel the Lord's been seeing in your several times since we've been here I personally didn't see a burning fire here but I saw it in you I saw it in you does God want to catch this building on fire he wants to catch us on fire with what the same fire that fell on the day of Pentecost praise be to God can I go just a couple more minutes notice in another thing that the Holy Ghost is in Ephesians chap 1:12 it's our down payment that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ and whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation and whom also after that you believed not when you believed but after that you believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise that's the Bible you get the Holy Ghost after you believe so what is it notice in verse 14 which is the earnest of our inheritance look at the meaning money which in purchases is given as a pledge or a down payment all of us know what what that is you bought a house you bought a car whatever it is so it's a down payment that the full amount will subsequently be paid so God gives us a down payment earnest money it's a down payment you're going to get the full thing in the full Resurrection praise be to God so what is the Holy Ghost it's your part of [Music] deity brother when the deity of God by the Holy Ghost comes into the human heart it calls out everything that Christ hasn't created you know that's the truth deity deity brother Donnie that's isn't that part of the godhead ah you have been listening it is part of the godhead it's that part of himself that was revealed in the type of Eve so God made man in his own image male and female created did he them and called their name Adam so Adam was both man and woman in his spirit is that right I think about it yesterday who but God who but God a title for a sermon who but God who but God could take this Earth in a chaos and turn it into a paradise Who but God could take dust dust off the top of the Earth and transform that dust into a heart liver kidneys lungs eyeballs ears skin muscle hair tissue senu turn it who but God could take a rib and turn it into the most beautiful woman that ever lived on the face of the Earth who could God could take a wretched Sinner and turn them into a child of God who but God can take this earth when Satan gets done with it I'm telling you it's going to be a mess and when God allows man to be able to bring it to a place of almost total Annihilation think of it the premillennium condition will be atomic bombs falling everywhere and we will actually walk out on the ashes of the wicked who but God could take the Earth in that stage and in a moment turn it into another paradise Who but God could take us a bunch of hardheaded stubborn no good no count good for nothing human beings and turn us into Tabernacles for deity who but God could take our unbelieving hearts and drive that Spirit of evil away from us and fill us with the Holy Ghost and we just love him and praise him and long for him and even when he does something that we don't understand and he he he kind of forces his will on us sometimes and we say no no no no no don't do that please don't do that I don't want that I no I can't do that God and somehow he turns us around and so moves us and makes that same person that was arguing with him and debating with him and he sues them and bathes them in his Beauty and bathes them in his nature and when he gets done with them they just turn right back around and say not my will but yours be done and you all are wanting to see Miracles yall are wanting to see signs that are so tremendous you'll hardly ever see a more rare one that God can take a stubborn man or a stubborn woman and so transform them to the will of God and God will turn right around and point that one to the devil and said let's see you do it I tell you what God can do God can say I can be able to perform signs and Satan can stand up and say so can I your sons can be able to perform Miracles and I'll send my false preachers out there and they'll do the same thing your boys do on but only God Only God can take an unregenerate person let's just be honest some of us in such a bad shape the devil said I don't think I even want them no more I don't want them belong to my tribe and God says I'll take them I'll take them he takes them changes them transforms them oh glory to God and not only just beats them just beats them just beats them no he don't even do that and Satan's looking at say how does he do that he don't have chains on Satan puts chains on his that' run away if he didn't have them he puts chains of alcohol chains of smoking chains of drug addiction come on somebody Jesus don't hold us with Chains It's Love we're not here behind great big gigantic gate don't you go there that gate D I'll get you oh papa oh papa I'm so sorry I'm so sorry but Papa swings open the doors and say there you go my children you all want that and we said no we we we like it back here Papa we like it back here we're safe but we used to didn't like it some of you women that's sitting here tonight with long hair and years ago when you first embraced this truth this one of the hardest battles you ever had in your life keeping your head from the barber shop you had scissor itis you had makeup itis you had the office bunch of itis boys all over for you and you said I'll never give up my makeup I'll never give up my mini dress and here you said tonight l d die long hair hanging down your back I mean a face that ain't painted up like an old Red Barn standing out in the field somewhere with a Godly decent dress on come on somebody wow only God can do such a thing and you're not here tonight CU you're scared you're going to hell but you're here because you love him amen you love him just rest yourself now for a minute but hang on they that are sons of God are led by the spirit of God then when the human element goes out and the spirit of God fills that vacancy when you empty yourself amen then will be when the church and its power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk in his steps and his power in his thoughts in his being in his moving you see what I mean then your thoughts will become words and words will become material that's when the church and its power when the human element goes out on the supernatural element comes in then your thoughts will become words and words will become material you believe whatever you wish to listen this next sentence I believe it's on its Road when the church will be so wrapped in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind so away from theirselves they don't see themselves they don't have no thoughts but to serve God their thoughts to move on they refuse the things of the world they move in the spirit live in the spirit Oh Glory move in the spirit walk in the spirit Soul fulfill the law of Christ then the love of Christ in the in the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost that great wonderful church will go forth with power and deity because deity will be revealed in human beings by the Holy Spirit bringing to pass the thought of their mind bringing to pass the thought of their mind well I don't mind telling you but if I'm alive I hope I am to see this but can you imagine when we get that place in Christ Jesus I just can't keep from believing and imagining in my own soul soul that one of the last thoughts that would be in my mind is I want to be changed so what it'll do it'll spread the Earth you imagine the mind that was in Christ Jesus is in every believer there is the soul Soul's in prison now November 63 mind that was in Christ Jesus so all God has to do from the throne is think one thought today is the rapture every person with that mind receives the same thought at the same same moment why it's the same mind in every believer so God going have to think it in heaven and then think it in Paul and then think it in Peter and then my goodness time it gets down here to us we'll be aged another 10 years but if we've all got the same mind now listen to me if we've all got the same mind then the spirit of God could think it from the control tower and every every member on the earth they might be laying you know might be in Africa and they might be in the nighttime but all of a sudden the thought of the Rapture and here we are on the bright side of the earth it hits us all at the same time text ain't fast enough WhatsApp forget it old school supersonic so I mean I don't know maybe I'm kind of weird but if I'm on to travel lock assault wouldn't I have to be one after all how did I get here in the first place I traveled as a thought from the mind of God glory to God thank you Jesus how am I going back that same thought in a glorified changed form J don't you see how how important the mind of Christ is no wonder says in the seven seal when the supernatural comes in that's the mind of Christ that's how God projects to you visions and Supernatural oh so oh better I've never had it yes you have if you've ever received a divine revelation from almighty God after receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost you were tapped in to the mind of Christ that's the way God projects it and you just stand in there and say oh my goodness I see it I see it well what happened to you a thought from God said Son see it and you on Earth said I see it God will say change and you'll say I'm changed am God will say resurrection and they'll be loosed out from under the altar from the sixth Dimension glory to God and they'll come to Earth to take our bodies think of it missing people they can't find you no more cuz you're getting together with with the rest of the group and you come up missing on the earth missing you come up missing on the earth like that movie I saw when I was a boy it's scared the liver out of me it still scares me much if I think about it now and there's this guy living in his bedroom and he happened to hit a certain place on that wall one day I see some of y'all still scared by it too and that guy through that wall and was like moving into another dimension if Alfred Hitchcock makes it through the Gates of Heaven I don't know how in the world it could ever happen but that's always stuck with me dimensional travel traveling like a thought now I'm really going to convince you I'm a Nut right think of it children we're living in that hour when our thoughts will become material we won't have to beat it up with the music we won't have to shout it down jump it down he'll project it down don't you want to be part of it it's bow our heads tonight can we praise the lord lord Jesus I pray tonight father that you would take this word and be able to break it down in our hearts Lord we live so far beneath our privileges we just let the devil wear us out over this and that and the other and how high you want to take us Lord God help us that we can latch on to your wings and soar in the Heavenly places help us to know we can trust Papa that he'll never let us fall oh Lord God open our understanding tonight Jesus I thank you so much for the token in this day I thank you that the intensity of the power has grown Beyond a breath and a little blow and a more powerful blow to the blow of the spirit has come together oh Jesus and before long the dead will be walking Among Us Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord Jesus if there's any here tonight that's dead in sin I mean May that great resurrector walk in this building father may you deal with them tonight Lord help them to realize they don't have to wait till Sunday they may not be alive but Sunday morning help them to realize tonight they can commit their heart to you if there's one that needs the Holy Ghost if there's some that's just the battles and things of life just wearing them out Lord that's what Daniel said Satan would do in the last day he would just try to wear out the patience of the Saints may you move among us tonight God may you Minister strength and healing and virtue Lord Jesus to your little bride we need it oh God I need it father like never before I need your strength I need your wisdom oh God to lead this portion of people that you've committed to my charge father we need need you Lord Jesus Oh come by this way tonight father we call upon your name oh Lord we need your help we need your strengths your courage hallelujah oh we worship you Jesus we worship you father I glorify your name I Praise You Now Lord God thank you Jesus anybody want to just enter in with me now remember you've got the Holy Ghost you've got that original fire God will accept your worship it's coming from the same fire that Peter worshiped it's not strange wasn't lit from this man's idea or this man's opinion but it come from the same altar the same fire of God so wherever the fire is present that means the worshippers can worship your worship will be received because the fire was taken from the altar where the sacrifice was given and when they would burn the incense as it was later dictated by the prophet they would take the fire from the altar of the sacrifice and they would then light the incense that come from the altar of sacrifice so their praise could only be received as long as it was offered from the sacrificial altar so our praise don't come because of emotion and because of beautiful music it comes because our soul has been cleansed by the blood of the Lamb so we worship and we praise Hallelujah don't you understand what your praise is it's an extension of his sacrifice so he give gave himself for you then his life in you motivates you to praise and worship and thank him I'll tell you children one of your quickest ways down to defeat is to give up your praise when Satan gets your praise he's just about got you whipped don't you never don't you never let him take your praise Carol told me the other day you can imagine we're all still struggling of course with Erica's past and I know many of you are I know you are you loved her and you prayed for her I'm hearing from people around the world their hearts are just still brokenhearted Carol told me the other day she said I'll tell you Donnie I asked her I said how you doing honey she said some days I just cry all day some days I do better she said but there's one thing I've learned I've learned to praise him and she said even when I I I I'm crying I don't know what else to say I'm praising him I'm thanking him for taking her I'm thinking him she's not sick no more we thought God was going to heal her didn't you sure that's what most of us thought well he did just not the way we thought come on she wasn't just healed of her body she was healed of her mortality she'll never get sick again she has embraced the fullness of her healing if he would have healed her of cancer no doubt she would have got sick again brother R said people would he said if you get sick to heal tonight you will probably get sick again where she's at she'll never get sick again brother Jean Littleton blessed his heart he got so sick and suffering it's never happened again oh my goodness bless his heart the last couple of days before he's passing reaching out for sister Helen glory to God he ain't reaching out for her no more I imagine they met down at the river him and all the rest of the Saints here come my little blond-headed daughter down there screaming he's arrived he's arrived brother Jean how are you how are you praise be to God that ain't an old man's dream that's God's word brother sister that's the way we want to be don't we oh hallelujah hallelujah let's just worship Him can we now from the alter of our heart which has been purged by the blood of the sacrifice set on fire by the pillar of fire now our praise can come forth oh you don't know how it feels unless you were in Pentecost to use your gift and you feel like you prostituted it in the old tent days Harry brother Larry some of these brothers that played in Pentecost and you feel like that you took your gift and your talent and it was used to stir people and their emotions and get them all fired up if you ain't never done that it's very hard to describe what you feel like and you still have an element of restriction when you come to the word of the hour because you're so afraid that you lead people back into that again by your gift oh but when you know the altar has been purged and you know the spirit of God can anoint you then you can offer your gift and your talents and you know it's coming from a heart which has been purged it's coming from a life that has been lit not by 1906 but by the original fire that fell on the day of Pentecost I hope you understand what I'm saying tonight the same wind that blowed in the upper room is right here in this church tonight it ain't a little breeze it's the same Mighty rushing wind we need more than a little breath friends we need more than a little stir God knows if there's ever an age that needed this power it's us we can't make it intellectually we can make it on our mind we've got to have the Holy Ghost amen and it's power don't you love him can we just turn and lay hands on one another if you would I want you to just pray for the brother sister standing there by you just whatever the Lord places upon your heart you young people pray for one another be a strength to one another you see your sister down your brother down young people God's called you you're more than just yourself God's called you to help others just like us older ones let's pray now with all your heart I want you to

over the people if you would it's going to take that Mighty Breath of God blowing upon each of our souls oh it blowed on me when I was in Pentecost but I needed more and I couldn't get it till I come
