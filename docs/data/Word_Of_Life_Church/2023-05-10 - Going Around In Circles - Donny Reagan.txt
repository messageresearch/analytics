wanting me to keep quiet so here it is Blue Devil says first of all I just wanted to say how much I wanted to thank brother John for the service last couple Sundays ago said to just really bless his heart brother John was talking about just going up the pitcher's mound talking the picture telling him that you're not taking him out of there what you're doing and said that really personally spoke to his heart and Drew so much strength from what brother John said I said he felt like it was just personally for him as he'd been struggling with thoughts that the devil had been put in his head about how he's not worthy and he was useless a bunch of other thoughts as they used to be competitive thrower and that really really spoke to my heart so deeply and personally and just says a couple

[Music] [Music] oh it's not all about the wise men traveled from a fall it's about the crow it's about my sins about how Jesus came to be born once so that we can be born again it's about the storm that was rolled away so that you and I could have real life someday it's about the cross it's not all about the good things in this life I've done it's not all about the treasures trophies that I've worked it's not about righteousness that I find Within it's all about his Precious Blood save me from my sins [Music] it's about my sins it's about how Jesus came to be born once so that we can be

he knows how much sand is on the shore he's seize every sparrow that falls he made the mountains and the sea he's in control of everything of all creatures great and small and he knows my name every step that I take every move that I made every tear that I cry and he knows my name I'm overwhelmed by the pain I can't see the light of day I know I'll be just fine He Knows My Name [Music] don't know

my name me [Music] He Knows My Name [Music] [Applause] not not only our name but the name of every other Mortal that has ever lived on the Earth it's hard for me to comprehend myself actually the billions of people that have lived on the Earth and yet the Lord knows every one of them he knows exactly where they will stand in the last day how to judge each one of them according to what they heard according to what they knew you ever just think about that it's just overwhelming as I've traveled around the earth and you're going to a lot of major airports and you see thousands times thousands and thousands of people and you go into the major cities of the world I've been into many of them and you just see hordes and hordes of people you think where do they all fit how does it all happen how does it all work but I'm so glad our God knows where everybody fits amen isn't it a privilege for us to be together tonight turn with me to the Book of Joshua chapter 6. now let me just say here tonight that I have preached um from Joshua chapter 6 for many many years and I spoke about here not long ago but I'm going to preach about it tonight in a way but I have never spoken before as a matter of fact never even thought of it before until this evening I thought that I was ready for tonight had a nice little sermon all put together a lot of really good scriptures a lot of good quotes and I just thought it was a really good sermon that the Lord pushed paused on that one and wanted me to bring this one to you tonight so what I want to speak to you tonight is on this thought going in circles going in circles Joshua 6 1. now Jericho was straightly shut up because of the children of Israel none went out and none came in October the sister when the children of God are Marching hell is upset and the Lord said unto Joshua's see I have given into thine hand Jericho and the King thereof and the Mighty Men of Valor now for those of you who know history very well you know that Jericho is the oldest longest inhabited City on the entire Earth the Earth no older city than Jericho as far as inhabitants being there and ye shall Compass the city all ye Men of War and go round listen carefully round about the city wants you'll go round about in other words going in circles you'll go round about the city once thus shalt thou do six days so they're going in circles for a total of seven days six days absolutely nothing will happen and seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of Ram's horns and the seventh day you shall Compass the city seven times so on the seventh day can pass it seven times and the priest shall blow with the trumpets and it shall come to pass that when they shall make a long blast with a Ram's Horn and when you hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall Shout with a great shout now notice and the wall of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall Ascend up every man straight before him I may like to be remembered tonight as we pray have a need to request on your heart those of you that are invisible to us tonight I'm sure you do as well can we just bow our heads and approach the Lord Heavenly Father we love you so much tonight we're thankful Lord Jesus for all that you mean to us Lord how we appreciated that song you know our name not only our human name but our divine name Lord God we're so thankful that you know all about us you know about all the Journey of life that we'll have you know the difficulties and the happy times that we'll have you know all of that Lord those things will take us by surprise down here yet nothing has ever taken you off guard or by surprise so it gives us confidence in you and in your word so as we Endeavor to look into your word tonight and as I Endeavor to bring what you placed on my heart this evening I pray that you would help me Lord may you capture our Attention our thoughts speak to us as only you can do father we commit the speaker the hearers and the word into your great hands lord it's in the name of the Lord Jesus that we ask it amen God bless you you may be seated so according to archaeological digs into the Carbon 14 dating as far as what they've been able to take it back to about the time of Joshua Jericho was many different sizes and different time frames smaller sometimes larger sometimes but by the Carbon 14 dating that they've been able to come up with so far the circumference of the city of Jericho and the time that Joshua and the children of Israel would have been marching around it was about a half a mile so the circumference as you had started out from wherever point that they started on day one and they March around and they make a complete Loop all the way around the city on day one and they would come back to where they started and they would have covered about a half a mile so that would have been a total of marching about six and a half miles in seven days now that wouldn't really be that much for a runner that wouldn't be that much some of you can probably walk I know there's people here that can ride their bicycle a whole lot farther than that in a day but if you were sick or if you were weary or if you were old now can you imagine trying to walk now remember when they come out of the land of Egypt the Bible says there was not one feeble among them but it doesn't say this about this Trek in Jericho so that was something God gave them for that little time frame of coming out of the land of Egypt but it only lasted for a while for the rest of the time that got sick they got tired they got weary they got feeble they got old and all of that so for you to be able to walk a half a mile on day one a half a mile on day two and so on until day seven and then on day seven you're gonna make seven trips around so a half a mile half a mile half a mile half a mile half a mile well what if you're sick well what if you're just down that day and you just don't feel like walking well you know a lot of the victory would have depended upon the faithfulness of the people now I'm sure that we're probably all more alike than we are different I would imagine that for almost everybody here under the sound of my voice that you go through times in your life to where that you feel like you're just in circles you know I've never really geographical diagrams and drawings a circle has never been one of my favorite I like a trapezoid I like a pyramid I even like a square bigger better than a circle a rectangle they're just I've got favorite you know as we all have I just have favorite of those measures but a circle it just seemed like to me that you're not going anywhere it's just same light that you're going around and around and you're seeing the same things and the same people and you're feeling the same way and it's like the sun comes up the same way it sets the same way you know I believe sometimes the reason that people get weary even with going to church it's because they're in a church Circle instead of a church pyramid and they go to church and to them church is the same ever service so it don't mean no difference who's preaching who's singing a special song what's going on to them it's just church as usual well you know I find that pretty sad myself and pretty disappointing because it depends on what you and I will expect Church to be and what we put into it will be a lot of what we get out of it so a lot of people they just get to that in their walk with was God a lot of people in their marriage they're in a marriage Circle so they just go around and around and around and around and the husband gets tired of the wife now of course from this point on until I get done with this nobody says anything everybody's such earned Smiles except for the single people and they all say Amen because they ain't married yet but all the married people if they're not really careful they will get in a circle and you get up and you do the same old things every day and you say the same old things and she's a response to the same things that you've said for the last 45 years and she responds with the same old things and then you respond in the same old way and you go to Walmart at the same time and you get the same old groceries and the you know the same old same old same old and people get so bored with the drudgery of marriage and the devil knows that that's why he wants to cause them to do something outside of marriage to bring a little bit of excitement to the marriage well it's the same way with church it's the same way with our walk with God I wonder how many of us tonight if we would be able to look at the geographical measure that would perfectly describe our life would it be a trapezoid would it be a pyramid would it be a rectangular would it be a square would it be a very complex design or would it be just a circle that we went around and around and the devil knows what we're going to do he knows the prayer we're going to pray he knows the way we're going to clap our hands three times and then stop and then one and then we stop again and three times and then amen three amens and 14 all mice and then three oh my oh my and he got us right down I'll tell you what every now and then we need to just kind of change that to mess with the devil it's nothing else just so he don't know what we're doing but uh what I what I looked at this evening is the Lord started dealing with my heart about this was that there were three now listen to words that the Lord spoke to me that they were moving on and they're going to uh day one and day two and day three and day four and day five and day six and this is what the Lord told me this afternoon that these were non-mirical days [Music] non-mirical non-miraculous day so they had six non-miraculous days Days by which they're going to do the same thing over and over again so the priests are going to do a certain thing and they're going to walk a certain way and the people are not allowed to say anything at all day one day two through day six so it was going to become what seemingly would be very methodical and it could seem as if so nothing was happening and I wonder if in our life sometimes that we don't get into these non-miracular Circles of everyday walk with God now maybe you're different from me but I have a lot more non-miraculous days than I do miraculous days now I I love the miraculous days when they come don't you I love it when they're there but I have to be honest with you I have more days that are non-miraculous than I do that are miraculous but I wonder are those days in vain or are those days not necessary and essential to lead up to the seventh miraculous days now if we did not have the six days of our life would they not lead consecutively up to the seventh miraculous day but if they were not there I wonder would the seventh day be as miraculous without the prior six now you see it's in these non-miraculous days whenever we are simply obeying the word we're doing what God says we go to church we read our Bible we pray we live right we do good deeds we do good works praise the lord we do all the things that we're supposed to do and yet by the end of the day when it comes well you was asking God for healing or a miracle didn't happen day two you go to church or you read your Bible you go to work you pray you do all those things the end of the day no Miracle again day three day four day five day six but yet you did ever everything the same way you love the Lord you lived right that day you obeyed his word and you praise him for what you believe he's going to do but he didn't do it yet but you kept on praising him anyhow anybody going to hear me tonight now I wonder if we don't look sometimes at the seventh day of the miraculous and make it the greatest day of all and we live if we're not careful we would like every day of the week to be number seven so Monday would be seven Tuesday would be seven Wednesday would be seven Thursday would be seven Friday you understand Saturday and Sunday and then the beginning of the next week it would all be 777. well what you're wanting is the Millennium right now but I hate to tell you it ain't here yet but in this cycle of life that we're in we more than likely will have more non-miraculous days than we will the miraculous now God does this of course for a reason to check our faithfulness and to make sure that we won't get weary and I've got to be honest with you sometimes I do anybody else in your get weary you know it's amazing that the miraculous days generally don't make me weary now if I could just figure out how that works and I just have such a good day on miraculous days and when everything is going good when I do have one of them days let me see how many years has it been since I've had one of them days that ever seen during that day was good let me think about it and I'll get back with you on that one but you know it's those types of days when we can become so weary and worn anybody know what I'm saying now I want you to notice uh continuing here in Joshua 6 12. that the word says and Joshua rose up early in the morning and the priest took up the Ark of the Lord and seven priests bearing seven trumpets of Ram's horns before the Ark of the Lord went on continually and blew with the trumpets and the armed men went before them but the reward came out to the Ark of the Lord the priests going on and blowing with the trumpets and the second day they compassed the city which meant they circled it again they compassed the city once and returned into the camp so they did six days so they've got six circles six non-miraculous Circle days nobody shouted nobody run nobody jumped you couldn't even get him to say Amen God told him not to say one word so it was a very non-eventful six days they're not singing they're not worshiping and that's one of the hardest thing in the world for a human being to keep their mouth shut can you imagine that was a miracle within itself so they couldn't complain they couldn't praise they couldn't pray they just couldn't do anything now I would imagine when they got back to their tent they'd done all of the above and more included now can you you just and your mind as I imagine in mind but the nation that they would walk out there and they would do this it would take them however long to walk a half a mile now that was not all hassle each of course and they would have the old and the feeble and the infern they did not have ambulances to be able to tote them around they did not have wheelchairs as far as we know so maybe the pace was quite slow it was not as fast as some of the others would have liked for it to been so it would have probably taken a good while because it had around two and a half million people so they're going pretty slow so it would have been you know quite a while so from the time they start until they get done they imagine some and they're speed Walkers and they're called Plumb back at the rear end the re-reward now that's the way some of us are we want God to do it now because we are Leo to sins we've got microwave popcorn we've got instant mashed potatoes we've got instant coffee and we want an instant God to go along with our instant coffee but God has not changed even though your meals have God don't have a pop it in and pop it out 30-second warm up and you get it no God still goes the old-fashioned God way and that is he will try us like never before so here they go day one absolutely uneventful at all no Miracles no healings no signs no wonders so they all do they finally get to and I hate me and people around this half a mile track and they all go back to the camp can you imagine they go to getting together I said what in the world was that all even for I don't even understand what did we just do did you feel anything brother Paul that you feeling the same brother Rob what about the rest you but Fred well did you feel anything when we ran around brother John did you feel any tingles or anything up and down your spine or did you hear anything was there anything did I miss it anybody see a vision anybody catch a dream anybody feeling anything Supernatural that happened in this and no no I didn't see a thing I didn't feel a saying I didn't hear a saying the pillar of fire wasn't there as far as I know the cloud wasn't there uh I'm not even sure why we was doing this well maybe tomorrow will be better so they come back to church on Sunday morning and then they're there now they kind of start the same way and the song literally gets up well that means happy to be here today well they still remember Wednesday night so they're kind of setting a lot in the form of a circle that's their mentality now God wants them to be a trapezoid on that service but they've still got this circle mentality and you're not moving them out of it I don't care what you do well I feel sorry for the song leader sometimes you come in you're all loaded down with everything in the world on you and they're trying to get you all pumped up and they're trying to get you up to receive the word y'all to appreciate our brothers I said John appreciate them you ought to try to cooperate with them and help them they're trying to do it for you so day two goes by nothing another non-eventful day not one Miracle we have no record whatsoever that anything happened on day one up through day six so it must have been be very obvious to the People by now by the time they reach day three four five Oh you mean we've got to do it again today huh we got to go back out so I was at church Sunday I didn't feel one thing you made I gotta go back again tonight well what if I don't feel anything tonight well if you don't maybe come back Sunday and it'll be your day but what if I don't I'd keep coming back until it is your day because your seventh day will arise now it may be longer than seven sometimes I've found seven days turned into seven weeks and I'm just hoping it don't turn into seven years you know but God always knows exactly what he's doing does he not so when you calculate this set now it would have been a total of 13 times that they March around the city so they want to run around Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and Saturday that would have been six times now on on the seventh day of course they go around seven so seven and six as you know is 13. so they go around this thing 13 times an accumulation of six and a half miles that they walk around this city and all six days prior to this have been non-miraculous my goodness I love that word I was just overwhelmed today when the Lord spoke that to me I'm not sure that Webster even knows about that word but it don't matter to me apparently it's it ranks in heaven so all matters to me anyway so six days were non-miraculous they were non-eventful nobody felt and he's saying nobody heard the wind nobody saw the pillar of fire and maybe some of them got up on the seventh day so you mean we got to go through this whole deal again today oh no you're missing and we've got to go around it seven times today seven times now remember the sick the feeble they had not been healed on day one they had not been healed there's no record one miracle that all happened on those days what are they doing they're making circles around Jericho so around and around and around they go you know Satan loves himself to you circles now listen to me God will use them at times in order to prove a point but Satan loves to get people in circles almost like a merry-go-round so where people get on this same and it's like they cannot get off now I as I said circles has never been one of my favorite things because my balance is really weird in my head always has been so as a child I could never go around and around right any type of ride my goodness a round or two and I'm laying on the floor sick as a dog so I never really enjoyed circles but you can imagine whenever we get on the Merry-Go-Round of Satan's scheme of life and he will get you on this thing maybe it's a besetting sin or maybe it's something going on in your life and you're in this unending cycle of this circle and you do wrong and you repent and you do wrong and you repent and you do wrong and you repent and you say to God I'll never do it again and I'm sorry Lord and I'll never do it again but you'll wind up doing it again and then you repent and then you do it again and then you repeat and then you do it again you're not on a trapezoid you're not on a pyramid you're on a circle oh Hallelujah but if it was the Lord God who gave me this today this evening I believe tonight we can break some of these circles hallelujah hallelujah oh my soak you they go around with all the accumulation now of the six and seven days so they track this half a mile and they'd walk all the accumulation of it it would have been a total of six miles in 13 times so a total of 13 times or six and a half miles but on the 12th time it would have been a total of six miles that they walked and absolutely nothing happened so they went around and around and around and around for 12 times and saw nothing now you don't have to raise your hand tonight but if you came to church here 12 Services found nothing got nothing out of service would you come back 13. oh some of you ain't gonna say all right you got to think it through huh so 12 laps they make no change whatsoever now I find this so strange but afraid because 13 it's not one of God's Divine numbers actually 13 shows up in the Book of Revelation of course that numbers our our nation and 13 is not a it's not a good number but yet 13 it was on the 13th round that actually the miraculous started taking place now why not on 12 which is of course a patriarchal number which is the 12 tribes of Israel why would God choose round 13 in order to bring his Deliverance well I don't have the answer for you but I'll give you something think of that anyway so you can imagine now 12 times they go around nothing happens non-miraculous trips another and another and another absolutely nothing takes place what is God doing God is doing to them what God does to us sometimes and that is God is checking us out on trip one trip two trip three trip four on up to trip 12 and c will we become so weary in the non-eventful trips that we say I'm not going back anymore but you see even though it might not have seemed like that God was doing anything God was taking notice of their behavior in these non-miraculous days they were still doing what God Said do you see we want to get God's attention don't we don't we want God's attention tonight well I'll tell you how we get it it's not by calming our hair on a certain side of her head or we all disciple all our white on Sunday no that's not how we get God's attention we get God's attention by keeping his word now that's what God loves is when people will keep his word so God is listening to what they're saying God Is Watching what they're doing and God is seeing that they are obedient they feel nothing they see nothing they can tell no difference at all now remember 12 trips around this a total of six miles all tall and they have seen not one thing not one little tiny gravel fell off from the top not one little bitty rock fell out from the middle of the wall they saw nothing they heard nothing they could tell no change whatsoever but yet they were doing what God had told them to do under their leader Joshua I wish somebody would say Amen you see obeying the word in non-miraculous days is what makes the word made manifest on the miraculous day oh glory to God oh glory to God thank you Lord Jesus I'll tell you I just about had me a spell to sing them when he spoke that to me obeying the word in non-miraculous days is what makes the miraculous day well this day five day seven day ten day Thirty whatever it is it's you being faithful to the word of God I mean it wants to be faithful notice this scripture I love this in Galatians chapter 6 verse 9. I know that you know it but if you don't know it this ought to be one of your favorites when you get down and weary and let us not be weary in well-doing weary and well doing look at the meaning of this word to be utterly spiritless to be utterly spiritless how many knows what it feels like to be down in your spirit I'll tell you one day if you don't oh my goodness it is absolutely incredible how you feel I have been so low in my spirit at times and the longer I'm there my physical body will start reacting and responding and I guarantee if I went to a doctor that check my respiration they check my heart they checked all those things and said there's nothing wrong with you there's absolutely nothing wrong you're this is good and that is good and that is good it's all just psychological well in one way they're right but it's more than the psyche of man it's in the second realm of man which is man's Spirit you know what I'm saying don't you when you get down and you get weary and you read the Bible you listen to tapes you go to church and you're pressing and you're trying your best and it seemed like you just cannot get what you need from God what's going on that's when God is allowing us to be tried and we must prove to God day one day two through day 12. I am not giving up God I am not turning back not only to God but let the devil know you ain't knocking me out I'm a Child of God I'm a daughter of God I'm a son of God notice this is from a man who understood weariness oh my you know imagine how low that Paul must have seen sometimes sitting in the Roman prisoners you know he was in there like three to four times whenever he wrote some of the great Epistles of the New Testament and spoke about being free that man was spreading about freedom and being free in Christ Jesus setting locked up in a prison couldn't receive his friends could not go out and preach How could a man that was thrown in jail write about Freedom you think that man didn't get weary you think he didn't get down and thank God what in the world am I doing in prison I'd be so much better off out there preaching I'm a preacher Lord I'm an apostle I'm a prophet how can I how can I be in the will of God not out there well let me tell you something whenever brother Eugene Kennedy passed I was there visiting his wife and his son they're here tonight and his other family members his brother and a few more that was our brother her and while we were sitting there talking before brother Eugene passed and the Lord just dropped some inspiration down there and give me assault and I told them I said you know some people are known in life for what they do and what they accomplish and they can do this and that and the other and then but the lord gave me this thought some people are known for what they do but they're known for what they're not allowed to do but the Eugene was a very talented individual he told me that to wash her the dryer would tear up he would lay there in the bed unable to get up and he would tell sister Johnny to get a screwdriver and get a 3 16 socket and get this and that and the other and Sister Janet fixed their dryers several times via him laying in the bed don't you know he would much rather got up himself and took those tools but he was not known just for what he could do but he remained faithful when God took it away from him come on Sheldon you understand what I'm saying oh how many people are sick and would love to come to the house of God how many people that love to be up and about and doing their housework and this and that and the other but yet God In His glory somehow is going to use their testimony for a greater portion of the glory of God they're not just known for what they do but they're known for what they're deprived of doing and yet they are still faithful they get up and say the lord gave and the Lord took away but I said be the name of the Lord oh it's on those non-muraculous days those non-eventful days it's not hard to praise God when the walls are laying crumble down everywhere it's not hard to praise God whenever we turn in a testimony and here's a scan of a gross and here's another scan three years later and the growth is gone well my goodness nearly anybody can shout somebody that ain't never even shouted it feels like running around with a little bit but whenever the doctor says it's bad yeah well nevertheless or whoevermore says it don't look good can you still say praise God eyebrow was brought on the Earth by the Lord and the devil cannot take me all we need to remind him Hallelujah you don't belong to the devil I don't belong to the devil my life is not his your life is not his he cannot take me he cannot control me he cannot control you even unknown miraculous days my God is still God even though non-eventful days my God is a winner and I am a winner my God if they conqueror and I am a conqueror let us not be weary to be utterly spiritless to be wearing out and exhausted anybody ever get exhausted maybe some of you just feel plum tuckered out that's a good theological term man just just wore out you know Daniel prophesied that that would be one of the things that Satan would do in the last days that he would try to wear out the Saints he doesn't give up on the many of your souls he doesn't see that Pillar of Fire apparently hanging in that realm of your soul he knows I can't do none of that Soul no more but I'm sure aggravate their spirit I can sure aggravate their thoughts I can sure aggravate their mind I'll try to just wear them out make them weary all that I'm going to church and just let them go there and set like a bump on a pickle no well not bumps and we're not pickles we come here to worship God the Bible says we are Lively stones in the house of the Lord so we've not come just to take up space we've not come well I reckon I'll go I ain't going to get nothing out of it no we need to go and say Lord tonight might be my night but if it ain't tonight I'm coming back Sunday and if it ain't Sunday I'm coming back Wednesday and I'm coming back to next Sunday because my day is coming let us not be weary and well doing anybody here ever been weary and well done a few of us and God bless you cherubim Center here with us tonight we're so happy that you would grace us with your presence I guarantee you we've been weary this is from a man himself who become weary let us Paul's talking to himself let us not be weary and well done you mean a person can get weary in doing great and doing well they're doing exactly what God wants them to do but for a brother Fred how can that be because it's them non-miraculous days that you can get so I'll tell you one thing I love getting great testimonies in the emails and texts and things like that I can't wait to share them with people it's so encouraging but it can be a little bit circular whenever you're waiting from one testimony to another unless of course by eyes of Faith you say I'm going to go ahead and declare it another one's in the mailbox there's another one on the way oh Glory let us not be weary and well doing far in ah not our season but due season in due season we shall reap if we faint not now look at this word it's from the same group rather and it means to dissolve so if we don't fail or dissolve if we just don't dissolve metaphorically to weaken relax exhaust to be in feebled through exhaustion to be in feebled through exhaustion to grow weak to grow weary to be tired out to desponde and become faint-hearted so we will reap as long as we don't become this despondent faint-hearted well I guess I just I guess I just ain't gonna get my healing I guess I might as well just accept it I'll always be crippled I'll always be this or that or the other I I might as well just because I've tried and I've tried I've walked six miles around this city ain't nothing happened yet it's easy for anybody to see I'm just making circles and this arthritis is so painful I reckon I might as well just go ahead and sign up for it well I guarantee one thing if you sign up for it the devil will have the FedEx guy by the end of the week with another box for you and then but next week he'll have three or four more special deliveries for you so if I was you even through the pain and The Agony and the tears I'd box up that bunch of snakes and sent them right back straight to hell and said that ain't mine you get out of here devil you're a liar I may be having a non-eventful day I may be having a non-miraculous day but on this non-miraculous day I'm still praising God oh what are you going to do today brother Donnie I'm going to package up them rattlesnakes and say Return to Sender Return to Sender you've got the wrong address well don't you live at 209 Quail Run Court well that's where my body lives at but my soul is residing in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so if you've got depression don't deliver to my doorstep I don't want it I ain't got time to be depressed I ain't got time come on children I ain't got time to listen to the lies of the devil I ain't got time to say feel sorry for myself I ain't got time to say well devil I'll compromise with you there ain't no compromising born in my body I'll fight until I ain't got no more breath to fight with I'll preach until I can't preach no more I'll sing I'll shout I'll worship I'll praise Hallelujah I got time for the devil I ain't got time for you Satan notice Joshua 6 16 and it came to pass at the seventh time when the priests blew at the trumpets Joshua said unto the people nod and they all started nodding Joshua said unto the people for the Lord has given you the city do you understand he was giving it to him on day one day two day three now remember he's done said it past tense the Lord has already given it to you that's why people think we're absolutely crazy whenever we claim our healing and you may actually get worse after you make that claim and you accept that promise is yours I'll tell you one thing I've been studying some this evening and looking up on the Bill of Rights and all that and looking at some more things and I found some absolutely astounding statements that the prophet said the devil has not one legal right against you and I but you know what he is he's a bluff and a liar I said he's a bluff and a liar also found that astounding that he said the Lord Jesus robbed the devil I thought isn't that ironic so the Lord Jesus robbed the biggest robber that's ever been so he robbed him and took away from him any Authority or any power that he had he pulled all of his teeth he ain't got no power against you as a Believer and then he gives you the Holy Ghost to believe his word and enforce the promise in your soul glory to God now listen how it works listen to Prophet now now if you'll notice the subconscious is where you live that's where you yourself live that's the reason it's people it's hard for them to have faith up here first they say yes I got faith but down in here something says but it's not for you now part of it is the conscience and the other the subconscious of course the conscience works on mental Faith from the mind it's like a ship going across the sea the man up here in the deck you look at him and you say he's running the ship no he isn't running the ship the man down on the bowels of the ship is running the ship the engineer not what if hit ring a sign down through and say so many knots forward and the man down there would ring and go backwards so the man up front the guy with the writtenhouse had on the written eye Squad at five you know the outfit spotless just walks around everybody said yes sir yes sir yes sir and he says so many nights forward but the man down in the engine room says I'm going backwards now which way do you figure they're going to go well the man down there has got the controls you see this is the way we are oh my now notices he says the man down there would ring and go back or say what if he'd say go to the right and he'll turn to the left and the man that bear couldn't steer it the man died on the inside is the one that sends the ship well this fella up here says I believe God heals mm-hmm and I believe is the same yesterday today and forever and your subconscious down there says but it's not for you so the man up here to Hallelujah I believe Hebrews searching it yes sir I believe it's the truth and then when you go to declaring it I'm Healed I'm Healed let me knows what I'm talking about that little fear that little something there will kind of holds you back in what it is it's the guy in the engine room it's the subconscious and the subconscious don't want you to say what he says I remember years ago when I preached on that about the Titanic and the iceberg and how did it ripped the side of it and it was from the bottom down that it was basically the same thing here now he says notice well the fell up here I believe God heals and I believe it's the same yesterday and forever and your subconscious down there says but it's not for you now watch him he goes on to say you imagine this in 1954. now if you get the man up there to say forward I'm the man down here say forward you'll go forward if you can get God to say I'm the Lord that healer said the first conscience said I'm the Lord that he that seem and the subconscious say I'm the Lord that healeth say you're going forward [Applause] to God not whenever the subconscience aligns with God's word and the first conscience aligns with God's word guess what you do you break out of your circles the having flown in different parts of the world and many of you all know having flown into Atlanta that Atlanta does not get the title of being the world's busiest airport for nothing many a Time whether coming into Atlanta or going coming out you know coming from Tri-Cities or coming from wherever Johannesburg South Africa whoever coming from and you will get into your flight pass and then the captain will come on ladies and gentlemen the traffic is backed up and we're going to be circling Atlanta so they will have this flight flight 343 from Johannesburg South Africa well they got another one coming from Istanbul they've got another one coming from Cairo Egypt they've got another one coming from Tri-Cities and the other one from Asheville another one from Charlotte another one from here well what do they do they put them all out now here they are circling around Atlanta well I'm glad they space them apart don't you I'm really glad they face them apart so here you go I mean you're going like this I've set right there another thing Lord don't let this thing fall out of the air I mean you're just going around and around and around well I can't do that long I gotta have a straight path what do you do you find yourself going around and then the powerless voice will come on and say ladies and gentlemen we have been cleared to land well whenever they say that then the stewardess is of course I'm moving up and down picking up any paper and cups and all that sort of thing and you can feel the cabinets that goes to change him and you can feel as it's going down down down you could watch it and then I would always listen for is a landing gear and the landing gear will come down I never did like the thoughts of landing on the belly of that thing so I'm always glad when I hear that thing go and then another and then the one up front the nose gear and they say yeah here we are here we come in like this why because we got out of the circle what are we doing where are we going nowhere or something going around and around flight 13 is going around and around and the methodists are going around and around and the Baptists are going around and around and if we're not careful that's his message people we'll just make our own Circle and shot the same path I would just well we go to church and we do this and we all gather over to the fellowship hall I don't want that to be our church I don't want that to be our destiny we don't want her to get in a circle well we don't pray and we don't praise and we don't worship and we don't reach out to God even on non-miraculous days we're going to praise him When God says I'm the Lord that he will see and the subconscience or this conscience said I believe it's so and the subconscious said are you quite sure you see some of these voices that y'all have heard been hearing and you're thinking it's demons it's worse than that it's you understand sometimes it's a lot easier to get rid of that devil than it is get rid of your thinking so you're thinking the devil doing this and the devil said it's that man down the engine room he's afraid he's afraid to say speak to this body and say in the name of Jesus turn me loose Hallelujah I read a court this evening and send it to Erica brother random said I want those of you that are sick I'm going to per say this prayer but I want you to pray it surely he said you think that I know how to defeat demons so I'm going to tell you what to say praise God so he began to say the words and you listen to the tape and you can hear the people as the people are repeating the words because he's standing there oh Glory he's standing there oh he knows his position day seven has arrived [Applause] you imagine as them Devils started clearing out of that place oh my goodness as that Prophet began to put the right words the right words of victory in the mouths of those people and they said now I'm going to say it but I want you to pray it and he begins to tell them what to say now Satan you've lost all legal rights come out of me leave my body in the name of Jesus Christ you can hear the people as they go to rejoice and blessing God why because that devil or Hallelujah had to obey those words that were given to that Prophet from God I'll tell you a friend when we can line up the subconscious and the first conscience with God's promise day seven has arrived oh thank you Lord God oh my let me jump down here read the southern we'll close her shortly thinking on our way Cleveland Tennessee 1959. May there come revivals that'll just set their hearts of Fire many thousands be brought to Christ let it start now Lord and Scatter throughout the world air the coming of the Lord Jesus on the pressing times and the battle and the fog will be low and we will not know which way to go you know David said it this way that it would come the people would be at the place they would be at their wits end their wits end they would know what else to do they wouldn't know the way out they would know which way to turn we're their friends notice he said the fog will be low and we will not know which way to go but be walking let us find him praise God let us find him now who is a very present help in the time of trouble can you imagine now you're the prophet is relating a time when we would walk in circles and we would need him to help get us out of this vicious cycle if you're in that cycle tonight whether it's a besetting sin or you're dealing with this sickness or this disease and instead of getting better it's getting worse let us find him tonight this this is in Cleveland Tennessee just uh East there I guess it would be out of uh out before you get to Chattanooga those of you that are familiar with the area and brother Brennan and the further part of this quote in the beginning of it he says God May there be a Revival that'll Break Forth in Tennessee House of praise God Amen let us find him now who is present present help in the time of troubles for we ask it in his name and for his glory Deuteronomy chapter 2 verse 1. then we turned and took our journey into the Wilderness by the way of the Red Sea as the Lord spake unto me and we can pass Mount Sierra many days uh-huh you know what the word Compass means and circle so we went around and around and around and around Mount Sierra and the Lord spake unto me saying ye have compassed look at the meaning of it surround in circle be brought around to March or walk around Circle about make a circuit God said you have been walking in this circle this mountain long enough turn you northward praise God praise God Marching In Circles let me close my mind goes back to one more individual by the name of Samson a man that great tool for God but he kept fooling my sayings until it finally overtook it it flew with it and repent and go back at it again and repent go back at it again but eventually under Delilah it took him got his eyes God is Covenant got his strengths and now they've got Samson chained to a meal you imagine him as he goes around and round and round not a trapezoid not a pyramid of seven Church ages but a circle and the Philistines meal grinding meal for the flower and their biscuits and their bread laughing ridiculing making fun of him but the Bible says his hair began to grow back out what was it the seventh day was fixing to arrive praise God but in non-miraculous days Samson was repenting in non-miraculous days the prophet uses him on this character whenever he preaches about thinking on your way and he said Samson begin to think on his way and he began to remember those great days of Victory and we remember of course what happened the table is having a great celebration for Dagon and the prophet tells us that this great Coliseum was built in the shape of a mushroom so it was real large canopy on the top and had two great pillars structurally designed so the weight of the whole canopy of the top of the mushroom would be on these two pillars how many non-miraculous days did he have they would go round and round and they'd barely feed him beat him ridicule him make fun of him Oh Glory but in these non-miraculous days he was repenting getting right with God had a victory coming forth oh when they bring him out and he's let out by a little lad not a great guy but a little small child more humiliation and he speaks to the little lad and said Place me next to the pillars and Samson began to feel and his hair had already grown out what was happening inch by inch day by day his hair was growing repentance was adding The Virtue to his body and the Covenant was being restored all those non-miraculous days is going to lead to the biggest Miracle of his entire life praise the Lord and as Samson stands out and he said oh Lord one more time remember me Remember Me Lord once more and the spirit of God came on him and he began to push on them two pillars and that great mushroom-shaped Coliseum begin to shiver and Quake and Shake unto the power of God and the Bible tells us that Samson killed more the day of his death than he did his entire lifetime why those non-miraculous days led to the ultimate victory of his life sometimes we look and well Ma how many prayers have we prayed for brother Eugene Kennedy how many prayers have we prayed for others and yet the Lord took a moment we say oh no oh that was wasted by no means it was not wasted at all God heard every prayer that we pray concerning those things and God had a will that's absolutely right I we can't determine that we have no way to know who it is or who is that well brother Donnie because we pray for someone they die shall we continue on absolutely a death sentence from one does not mean it's a death sentence for the other Only God Can decree that don't you let the devil even use a saint as your example because that Saints life come to an end it does not mean your life is going to come to an end if God's going to draw you God will let you know God's Prophet said he will never all you from the earth until he makes it known to you foreign so where are you if I get stuck in this circle for six months y'all might as well plan on me being back I'm not going to stay home if I don't feel him if I pray and you don't answer I'm not staying home now you may think that works for you but I'm going to tell you right now it don't work for you either no that don't work for you it's crazy how people do it they stay away from church so that's the worst thing that they could do that's the very thing they need to do is keep coming back and keep showing God on those non-miraculous days I'm going to appraise you I'm going to love you I'm going to adore you I'm going to raise my hands if I don't feel one thing I'm going to praise you Lord God Because of Who You Are friends we praise God for the wrong reason we're supposed to praise him because of who he is not what you feel you don't praise God because of what you feel and what you get out of it you praise him because of who he is he's the almighty he's the omnipotent he's wonderful he's all-powerful whenever you get that right in your head you'll praise him whether you feed him or whether you don't now let me share this with you well the most difficult parts of this journey is trying to figure out is God got me in this circle and he's trying me or if Satan got me in this circle trying to Blind me you see it wasn't the devil that got them in that Circle of marching around Jericho God did that and God will let you and I go in those things in our life just to see he's going to try you almighty God is going to try you I ain't talking about being tempted to the devil I'm talking about almighty God trying you to see if you will become weary and you will just take the back seat God will try you well when he tries me I want to be like oh Jacob now Lord I'll hurt you back off Lord I'll hurt you you understand what I'm saying well some of your recipient weak goodness gracious a little over a little neck what are you going to do when God himself meets you and said out of my way Dave you stand and say no Jesus I don't want to hurt you but I will if I have to I got to be changed I got to be changed I can't leave this face you'll imagine oh Jacob says Lord I'm telling you I will hurt you I will hurt you of course I found out who got hurt out of that Hill didn't we but his mind was made up he walked in their hole and he walked out a limp and Prince but he was never the same again whatever I've got to do whatever you got to do that's what he wants so if you're on this Merry-Go-Round of a besetting singing why don't you stop that thing tonight at Miracle around and say wait a minute I'm sick of this you're married folks your marriage up and down and in and out and up and down and fuss and arguing and fighting you think you're going to leave a big argument and a big fuss and go find a way in a Rapture I'm telling you you're not you need to have peace in your home you need to stop that argument the Bible says obey them that have the rule over you so I am telling every one of you quit fussing and arguing now if you don't do it you're obey disobeying the word well Glory [Applause] stop that Miracle around stop it all I can I can't yes you can get them three folks lined up God you and you to where you can all say the same thing I don't have to live this way I do not I feel it this way praise God a man wants to praise him on the non-miraculous days on the non-eventful Mondays well I shouldn't say that most Mondays are very eventful what gets me is I've been in the last little while it seemed like every day I'm having been Monday I'm thinking how in the world is this possible that every day is Monday but you know what I've learned the key Praise Him anyhow praise him when you're up praise him when you're down praise him when you're not even sure where yours just keep on praising him above him with all your heart you love him with all your heart if God's got you in a Jericho Circle let me tell you in the name of the Lord Jesus you will not lose unless you get weary and will doing and you lose spirit and you lose hope can you imagine Florence Nightingale laying there you've seen the picture most of you look like a skeleton skin draped over and when brother Brandon went to pray for she said pray that I can die but he said seeing God had sent me there to hold a healing campaign I didn't think I could pray she had died and then a little Dove landed over on the windowsill praise the Lord guess what her seventh day had arrived Oh Glory to God hallelujah they'll arrives children how do you know tomorrow won't be your seventh day my brother Donnie wanted today it'll only be a bitter girl Miracle on Friday and if it don't happen on Friday but the radio may happen on Saturday if it made it happen on Sunday but if it don't God has it exactly in due season Jesus is the only one that I know of that can be four days late and still on time he showed up four days late for Elijah's funeral he showed up four days later and he was right on time you may think he's like I may think he's right but whenever you think he's late he's still on time [Applause] oh brother Dan there it's easy for you to say you've always got such Victory and you're the preacher is it is it last Friday Erica got sick we had to take her to the hospital they'd done a brain scan they found three lesions in her brain no everything don't always go good for me and what does that change absolutely nothing we still believe he's God [Applause] Hallelujah what does it seem like a vicious they've got their own steroids she can't even sit still sitting there shaking like this but our God we've got a schedule for an MRI on Saturday like Harry said it could be gone by Saturday anyway but if it ain't we'll still keep praising it Right girls here stands for girls tonight what are they going to do keep on serving God what are they going to do keep on praising you ought to see them when the mama gets sick we go down there to pray for them little girls Gathering all around them getting them Gathering right there with us and praying and calling on the name of the Lord why we don't know anybody else to turn to and people say well we've got to trust in God I don't like to look at it that way I say I love to trust in God I choose to trust in God and like it ain't like I've got to I choose to serve it I choose to worship him I chew all I wish somebody would hear me tonight I choose to believe him I choose to live for him he ain't never never done me nothing but good why shouldn't I serve him why shouldn't I Praise Him hallelujah hallelujah why shouldn't we love him he will break this circle he will break it our day will arrive hallelujah our seventh day will arrive the walls will come down [Applause] oh Hallelujah let me say how much I love and appreciate y'all you've stood with us during this whole thing with Erica so wonderfully as Christians you sisters have prepared meals and my goodness it just I stood the other day talking to one of the brothers about it and just busted out in tears because it just it just touches my heart to know what y'all have done the prayers that you've made thank you we're not in this alone it's not just a Parker thing and a Reagan thing we're a family of God partly and this is not just so for the pastor's family either we do you the same way Hallelujah Hallelujah I'm waiting for our God a prick that's on these non-eventful days on these non-miraculous days Hallelujah gonna praise him we're going to worship Him we're going to believe him or we're in our church so whatever your need is tonight whatever your need is maybe you're on a Merry-Go-Round of sin of a besetting sin a habit something another and you just can't seem to get off of it may God in his grace reach to you tonight and help you it might be a little bit scary when nothing is going around and you just think well I've got to do it and you go ahead and stick that foot out or you jump off or whatever you do it's either that or stay on it for the rest of your life and be miserable oh my but you need to remember and tell Satan you have no no legal rights against me none you're the one with the legal rights you know what he is a bluff a bluff and he knows how to Bluff let's pray together Heavenly Father thank you for those little simple sermons in that Lord I don't know about anybody else but I needed it thank you for sending it to us Lord Jesus I pray Heavenly Father for each one here those under the sound of my voice Dear God may you help each of us to be more determined than we ever have been before days one two three on up to six even on day seven at the beginning of the March they still didn't see any movement the second trip on day seven they still didn't third fourth fifth sixth they saw no movement at all until that seventh circle and it was the seventh that broke it praise God Lord God and we know that we are in the astronaut age the seventh age early on in this age they thought it was the coming of the Lord early on they thought what happened on Azusa Street was the original restoration but we found out it wasn't they thought when you sent a prophet in those early years that the Lord would come people quit their jobs and everything in the 60s when brother Branham was here they thought the Lord was coming right there that was it Lord one day the seventh day of the seventh age of the seventh hour under the seventh seal it will all synchronize together hallelujah hallelujah and the dead and Christ shall rise first and our seventh morning oh you're the prophet called it there and Satan's eating of God this evil age when he said whenever at the dawn of that seventh morning yes Lord the Lord Jesus until that time arrives we may have some non-eventful days we may have some non-miraculous days when it will seem so monotonous we're doing the same things that did the day before and the day before but Lord we know those days are not Barren or fruitless because a life lived by the word is the word expressed Enoch did not just live loose and cold and indifferent until the very last day of his life and then he got right with God he lived many non-miraculous days and many non-eventful days but all of those days led up to that one day when it was changed praise God oh Jesus we realize that's the way the Rapture will unfold itself it's not just that great something that'll happen that last day it's a day by day walk as the Bible says Enoch walked with God and was not for God took him but he had this testimony before he left that he pleased God I want to please you on the non-eventful days Lord I want to please you on the non-miraculous days because they're building up to the miraculous times that are coming hallelujah hallelujah we love you Lord I pray you'd move among the people tonight father you see what they have need of minister to them would you Lord God in the name of Jesus praise the Lord would you do me a favor would you lay your hand over on the person standing near you there and let's just talk for a word prayer maybe they're having some of those non-eventful times of their life they're just kind of low they're not ready to quit but no means they're not ready to give up but to just find themselves going through a low spot and then really just like to have a little strength and encouragement from the Lord tonight would you just pray for them fathers we have our hands laid one upon the other we're praying for one another Lord God in the name of Jesus would you minister to the needs of your people father God I pray for my brother Garrett tonight these musicians sacrifice so much Lord I pray for strength for all of them tonight father in the name of Jesus would you minister to them Lord they give and they give and they sacrifice and they practice and they give their worship Time Lord so that the Saints can be able to enter into the service I pray father you'd minister to every one of them Lord God is musicians they're touched and they're gifted but yet Lord we also need a refreshing from you I prayed for him tonight father in the name of Jesus May the spirit of God help him if they find themselves on on a circle and they can't seem to get off of it Lord and they played the guitar they played the drums they played the bass or the piano the organ and and they do it and they do it because they're called to but Lord they need they need a refreshing from your presence I pray for them tonight father in the name of Jesus oh Lord I pray for the deacons I pray for the ministers every one of them here Lord heavenly father they sacrifice the Deacon Brothers do dear God I pray in the name of Jesus that should minister to everyone in this building tonight father and those that would love to be here and can't be here tonight father in the name of Jesus I ask you that you'll let a fresh anointing come upon Harry Lord May the spirit of God God anoint him Lord I pray I don't believe we've seen our better days I don't believe Lord we're going to live on the past memory of what we were I believe the bride's better days is laying right before her I believe great things are ahead of us as the people of God we claim it as your people the prophet tells us keep walking children of the evening light and more will unfold itself I don't believe we've yet arrived at the fullness of what you want us to be but oh God we want to come here to this place with great expectation Lord each service that we come no matter who's preaching because it might be at that particular service that you would choose to manifest yourself in a way that we've all longed to see you Heavenly Father we don't want to be in a circle here in our place we're so glad to have it and we thank you for it but we don't want to get in a routine we don't want to get into just well it's church as usual but Lord God we want to come and expect you to do the great things that you've always done the prophet said we long to have those Apostolic times moving Among Us he said we see them among us but we long to see them more and it a greater way he also told us to ask for big things and ask for lots of them so Lord we're asking for our children we're asking for our husbands our wives our loved ones father those that are backslid Lord how many would baptize already since we've been here and I believe there's going to be more to come Heavenly Father may we not settle down in this little circle of worship at our new place and say well I guess we've arrived oh no Lord there's higher Heights there's deeper depths there's places we've never walked before Oh Lord God I pray in the name of Jesus anoint our faith anoint every Minister that share part of us Lord I pray in the name of Jesus anoint every Mama to pray for her children like never before I'm knowing every Daddy I pray Lord every holy ghost feels Saint here father May if you give us a fresh baptizing of the Holy Ghost O Lord until our souls are saturated with the presence of God until ever fiber of our being a social Lord that we don't worry about money we don't worry about this so that or the other but Lord we're worried about the father's business and we're concerned about the lost souls and we're concerned about the backsiders oh Lord God we worship you tonight father we want to praise you on the non-eventful days we want to praise

she climbed over the top of them ushers she went down between their legs she went over the top of them because she had a need oh Lord God if we'd get that desperate tonight like that little Mexican woman would oh Father what would it be for all of us in this place to say I've got to have a renewing I've got to have a refreshing I've got to have a stirring inside of my heart I don't want it to be
