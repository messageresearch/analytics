========================================
brother brother donnie's here to speak for us this morning so let's just look to what god will have for us in the service today yes i thank god [Music] lord jesus [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] i thank all for the evening [Music] thank god my jesus [Music] all around [Music] don't you appreciate it today if it wasn't for the night [Music] amen i appreciate it today i'd hate to think of where our lives would be i think of where they have been and what's what's been left upon our lives from those things which have been what would it be if it wasn't for the saving grace of god that touched us and helped us delivered us let's turn to saint john for this morning we're turning there we have an engagement announcement brother van gogh and sister angela from down in but david yancey's church are announcing their engagement to be married and attended a date for december the 30th and he uh he's planning on leaving here he said some people asked him what he was going to i'm going to move there or stay here but he's he wanted me to let everybody know he's planning on staying here we're real happy for our brother saint john chapter 4 verse 16. very familiar scripture that we want to read this morning two places john 4 luke 7 and if the lord would help me today i'd like to speak to you on scarred human beings scarred human beings john 4 16. jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither the woman answered and said i have no husband jesus said unto her thou hast well said i have no husband for they always had five husbands and he whom thou hast now hast is not thy husband in that said is thou truly luke 7. luke chapter 7. verse 36 and one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat was him and when he went into the pharisee's house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that jesus said it made in the pharisee's house brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment the pharisee which had been him saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him for she is a sinner let's pray my father i pray today may i be an instrument that you can take and speak to your children today lord i know that we have lots of hurting people and scar people and i know there's only one way for the cycle of scars to be broken that's for you to heal us i pray in the name of jesus the word of god would come for us today and that you would be able to take that word and speak to our hearts and just meet our needs lord i ask your father that you would help me that i could just submit myself to you into your presence may you just anoint me and anoint the people that we can receive from you lord help us we ask today in the name of jesus christ amen and god good to us may be seated god bless you these two women that we've read about are probably two very very famous characters of the scripture and they have something quite in common not just the attributes of being a woman a female as far as being messed up sexually or by marriage or that way but there's actually a cause that we want to look at this morning what affected these women to be in the condition that they were and remember our thought is scarred human beings i believe that there's probably many of you that are sitting here today that many of the problems in your life go back and tie back to scars that you received either when you were a child maybe a teenager maybe growing up maybe coming from a divorced home maybe being raised by a single parent coming from a home that you lacked the true kind of balanced love that you needed and because of that many of us around the message bear those scars today those scars can carry on for many generations until the word of god comes and breaks the effect of that scar on a person's life now i want to read something to you this morning i want you to listen to me carefully influence and shreveport brother ben's talking about this little woman at the well i found this this week and these other statements i'm going to read to you brother bam said here she was standing as we would call her today a woman of ill fame a street prostitute and he said this child had been turned out on the street and let go by her parents and too many of them today she was a lovely pretty young teenage girl in her 18th year now this woman at the well it was not a woman that was in her 30s in her 40s in her 50s but the prophet of god said she was 18 years old she had had five husbands and was living with a man that was not her husband what had caused him you know now so much of the time we look at her and say she was sorry she was a little down she was no good truly she was but actually the cause of this woman's behavior went back beyond even her own will it went back beyond even the influence of her own life she hadn't learned enough at the age of 18 years old to be exposed personally to sin on a first-hand basis but it was something that happened to her that she became so greatly influenced and her life was so scarred what was that scar a mother and a father that turned her out on the street a mother and a father that didn't have time to raise her a mother and a father that would let her go and not face up to the responsibility of bringing this child upright yet her name was in the book of life and jesus when he come to this earth he must needs go by some area why there's a child of god laying down there in the slum of sin there's a predestinated seed it's hidden down there in the darkness of the world it's all scarred up with things of life but yet its name is on the book of life the prophet said in her 18th year and just been out of high school but she took the wrong road in life here again 1962 he said while the disciples were gone there was a pretty woman that came out there and she was ill-famed you know what i mean a red light woman and you said she was a lovely girl but she there had been something to cause that and you said her mother had turned her out on the street when she was a kid we talked so much about juvenile delinquency he said it's not juvenile delinquency it is parent delinquency sometimes a girl goes wrong because her mother won't make her do right now listen to me parents as we said here this morning many of you your children are gone and many of you behaved in your family because a scar that was put on you that possibly was a scar that was put on your mother that possibly was a scar put on your grandmother that was possibly a scar that was put on your great-grandmother and on back and on back and on back but brother there's only one thing that is able by the spirit of god to break scars and that is the word now listen satan has studied human behavior he studied the genetics the hereditary makeup of human beings and satan found out many years ago that if he could hybridize the foods that we eat it would break down the cells then by us taking those foods in our body it would break down our genetic makeup and once a person got cancer in their cells once they got kidney trouble in their cells once they got these problems in their cells when they had children they in turn pass those problems right on down to their children now i'm going to tell you something safe to not only study that in the physical realm but satan knew the makeup of men i've spent a lot of time preaching to you about your body and i've spent a lot of time preaching to you about your soul but this morning i want to contact your communication channel which is your spirit you see the spirit of man is that part which has the effects of the memory the conscience and all that and when a person is deeply wounded it is not your mind that contains that hurt you think it is no it's not it is not your mind because your brain the prophet said you do not think with your mind neither do you love with your body but you love with your spirit and a wounded spirit is like a wounded cell how does cancer start cancer starts from a wounded cell a cell will be bruised and wounded and a spirit will come and attach itself to that blue cell and from there it forms a disease how are there many things in our life that we face even today because a person got their spirit wounded when they were a child or they got offended when they were a child maybe they got molested maybe they was raised up in a cold hall and it stored there inside their spirit and a person without the holy ghost they begin to act out this storage that is in their spirit and even a person that is born again with the holy ghost with their soul seal even though the devil may not be able to make you act it out he still holds it in your spirit it still causes bad memories it still causes bad relationships with other people now jesus you know just think what in the world is he doing the prophet said the disciples stood there and watched jesus they was talking this woman ill fame and they were they could not believe jesus was talking to such a woman like this and jesus said go get your husband now what was he doing he was contacting her so no her body no her spirit in her spirit was her life and her spirit was the storage of all these scars listen to this sometimes a girl goes wrong because her mother don't make her do that now listen for him you watch a woman that has been raised in a cold bad home and if that woman is not careful she'll do one or two things that woman will raise up her children to be like her or she will go the opposite direction with some leniency she will turn and put a deeper scar on them than what she has on herself and sometimes we think well you know i was raised in a cold home and i didn't have much love and i'm going to show my children how much i love them and we think letting them do whatever they want to do is showing love letting them come in at one and two o'clock in the morning oh well they can do whatever they want to do they're at liberty that's not love that's not expressing to them your love you are only scarring them oh you say man we're the message we're beyond this are we amen if i had the ability this morning by discernment i don't have that to contact every one of your spirits i could probably go down in there and find all kinds of things that has caused you to be the way you are today many of our marriages the reason there's such struggles that go on in between them it's because way back onto somewhere in a person's life there was something happen you watch a girl that's not raised up in the right kind of home and they'll have the right kind of relationship with her father and you watch that girl when she gets married and you watch and see what goes on inside her marriage even though she may have the holy ghost even though she may be a child of god if god does not help her to see that scar and heal up that scar in her spirit she'll never be able to feel toward that man like she ought to because she never had a real love from a father so she looks at this man as her husband but somehow she also looks to him as father and it's always confusing what does it do her children her daughters her family and then they come up and because of this she scars their life they scar theirs and they scar theirs and they scar theirs and they scar theirs and it just keeps going on but god has given us a word in this hour to get right down to where the scars are and that our spirits can be healed from scars that's been placed there by by parents that didn't care by preachers that disappointed you by people that let you down can you imagine this woman at the well 18 years old five husbands now living with a man that she's not even married to and what was the cause cause she had a mother that said honey do whatever you want to do just go ahead mama loves you mama was raised in a bad home and my mom my daddy and my mama was real strict on me and i love you and i'm going to let you do whatever you want to do honey and she did 18 years old married five times why a mama that scarred her life now she didn't have the real kind of love that she should have had at home so what did she do she went out looking for it out here and she'd marry this man and it didn't work out she'd marry this one it didn't work out she married this one it didn't work out she made that one didn't work out she married another it didn't work out she said i'm sick of marriage i'm just gonna start living with him what was the cause she was scarred scarred now maybe her mother was scarred and her mother before her and her mother before her and maybe her father and an uncle and this and that because you see many of these things friends are strings that runs in families and it affects people and it'll come right on down right on there until the person can recognize by the word listen you raising your children if you don't have children today you are sitting here as a mortal either you are scarring others or you are trying to help them get healed of their scars look at this jesus came by the city of psycho the several of these i just want to read a few of them to you he sent the disciples a way to buy food and while they were gone a little woman came out there pretty little woman maybe the child was turned out on the street by her parents and let her go anyway just do whatever she wanted to do talk about juvenile delinquency it's parent delinquency that's what it is maybe that child had the same thing her mother let her do anything it's easy for us to point our finger when our child goes wayward well the pastor done this the preacher this that the other it is your responsibility to raise your children not mine now i'm gonna tell you something friend god never give you an electronic babysitter call a television or a monitor for you to raise your child by there ain't nothing that will take the place of a godly father and a godly mother it is not my responsibility as the pastor of this church to raise your children i'm afraid friends we have played around and played around and played around and not been serious with this thing do you realize brothers listen to me you men do you realize the way you treat your wife if you've got a son in your home or a daughter in your home the way you treat your wife the way you honor her love her and respect her you are putting before your son then look son this is the way a real marriage is supposed to be this is the way you're supposed to do you're supposed to smack him and hit him and talk to him bad and be mean to him do you realize that's what you're putting before that boy god have mercy on the girl that he marries because you're scaring that boy you're putting a scar there and when he gets married he'll raise his son and he'll raise his son and he'll raise his son oh but brother god has come down in this last day to break the scars of satan on our life hallelujah her mother would let her do anything and she turned out to be a woman of ill fame now listen what the problem said about this prostitute we just read about luke 7. he said she made her her money by ill famed and she had a bad name among the people and she was just a young woman she had been turned out on the street wasn't because she was delinquent but because she had delinquent parents and they didn't try to take care of her now who was to blame he didn't say the priest he didn't say the clergy he didn't say the church the parents of both of these women that turned out to be the parents have pushed them off we don't have time for you mary we don't have time for you this that the other we're busy we're in the work of the lord we're doing this and that and the other go ahead do what you want to do just get out of our hair stay out as long as you want to we ain't got no curfew around here shout out to one o'clock in the morning three o'clock in the morning is that a good representation of christianity come on church don't you get quiet on me this morning do you realize you are scaring that child you raise up that child with no rules no regulations in your home do you realize what you are making oh i'm loving them no you're not you're scaring them look what it does maybe this mother thought oh i was mistreated as a girl and i love my little girl i don't ever want her to be scarred the way i was and she turned out to be a lord so she scars us so deeply she goes to looking for love but the kind of love she gets is the kind you buy and nobody really loves me nobody ready to scare you take a man and a woman a man that's been raised in a cold home a girl that's been raised in a cold home you put both of them together if they don't understand their situation ask god to help they will drive one another insane because he's wanting so much love she's wanting so much love and they pull constantly on one another why it's not many times because it's the lack of a wife love or a husband love it they were raised in such a home that their parents didn't have time to talk to them their parents didn't have time to sit down and put their arms around and say honey i love you i want you to know mama loves you and daddy loves you i'm proud of you they've never done that i wonder how many of you can recall your father ever putting his arm around you you see him son i'm so proud of you you're my boy i love you thank god for you i love you son how many of you sisters can recall your daddy or your mama look at you in the face and say honey i love you so much you have been such a joy to our home we so love you you said here this morning tell me it don't bother you some of you said you're 50 and 60 years old and when i mention this to you something begins to move and you know where it is it's your spirit because to the channel of memory i brought it back to you some of you already no longer than i've dealt with this already things in your childhood it's pop that but before you why it's not because the body remembers it so much it's not so much the soul but it's down inside that communication channel the spirit brother sister i don't believe god wants to just heal our body i don't believe god wants to just heal our soul but i believe god wants to heal our spirit when i was just a kid me and harry and my sisters we was raised there in kentucky and live near a patch of woods and we was all the time in those woods i knew it was out the back of my hand one day we went out there to have a picnic we come out on a little point over a water hole swimming hole we used to swim in there's a creek we come down through there and here come a fox running down and i'd never seen a fox that way before acting the way it was slobbers coming out of his mouth and running and oh my it terrified me and my sisters and harry and we were just small all of us wasn't very big i was maybe 12 13 years old something like that and it come down there and we started to run and my little sister she fell down and when she did that fox come over and she started putting her arms over her face to shelter herself and when she did that fox began to nibble on her arms and whenever i saw that i just couldn't take that that was my sister i wasn't no fighter i didn't know what to do but as any typical country boy i had a pocket knife in my pocket and i got that pocket now that i wouldn't cut nothing but i grabbed it out i couldn't stand there and let my little sister beat up by that animal and i grabbed out that pocket knife and when i did and i started to stab that fox and whenever i did he grabbed me right there in the hand and he laid my hand wide open from here down to here i've still got the scar this morning and every time i think of a fox every time i see one on the side of a road it comes back a flashback it happened so quick that fox bit me tore my hand open my sisters and my brother running me scared i stayed behind them being the oldest of the family and my hand went numb i didn't know what to do i broke an old dead limb off of a tree and i laid it across my arm like this can i thought if it comes back i'll hit him again and i we ran to the house and on the way to the doctor i told my mama i said mama please if i go if i go mad don't let me about the kids you know why i told that because my grandmother had told me about a little boy that had rabies that went mad and had to chain him to a bed now whether it's true or not i don't know because she could spend a lot of tales but it scarred me and as soon as i thought oh god i've been boxing i'll go mad every time i see a fox there's the memory of it every time i read about a rabid dog or a or something it flashes back something what is that it's a scar and those of you that were raised in a home that you didn't have the right kind of love and maybe you stand after church and you watch a father and a daughter or a father and a son that loving god and serving god and you see that father speaking to that son and you stand there and in your spirit you have got a moment of recall of how your daddy treated you and if you are not careful and by the help and the grace of god you will hand that or the reversal of that down to your child if you despise it and you say i'll never do that to my child i want to let my child know that i love it and then you just take all the reigns loose and all the boundaries loose let them come and go as they please let them do this and that and the other or you say well brother donnie they're not claiming to serve the lord you know they're living in my house and i'm going to let them do anything they want to do i read last week where the prophet was talking about sister meaty and women smoking he said if she ever takes up a cigarette she'll move out of this house because she ain't staying here and living that way and what are we doing we are scaring them with so-called liberty and love take a good lesson from god god don't let you do as you please when you please god has rules and regulations that you've got to follow that's right and we looked at these women their lives for years we've looked down say what that filthy prostitute but this morning let us turn back to her mother said did you ever think she would turn out this way i never thought she would do that i only wanted her to have freedom uh oh i i really didn't have time you see to raise her because me and my husband we wanted so much you see we wanted to borrow to buy a boat and we wanted to buy this and that and the other and i just didn't have time to raise my kids i just didn't have time because we wanted so many things you see and we scarred now there was something ordained of life in each of these women and your she comes up this woman this prostitute sees jesus sitting there scarred just like the woman at the well turned out on the street get out of my hair i'm busy i've got to make money i've got to do this you men god have mercy on your souls if you would father a child and bring it into this earth and not accept the responsibility to show that child how much you love it well brother donny i never come from a good home well brother look now we've got truce you can break that cycle you can break it and keep it from going on down my daddy never loved me like i thought he should either but by the grace of god the cycle stops right here i forbade it to go on any farther because i have truths my daddy don't know this my daddy maybe didn't understand the responsibility my daddy maybe didn't understand the scar he was going to leave on my life that even when i looked today 39 years old and i see men that are close to their son i see brother cobb and his sons how close they are how they talk to one another how they relate back and forth to one another and i stand there and look at that here i am 39 years old and i still miss that but i refuse for that to go on down into my daughters and scar them and then from theirs on down if there would be other generations i believe the scar can stop right here oh god hallelujah brother jeff jenkins was telling the other night in the camp there in ohio but his mother he come from a divorced home his mother left by the line he divorced him and brother jeff said his wife told him he said you've got a you've got a bad feeling towards your mother he said no i don't she said yes you do said because it reflects to me you'll talk about her nice start out nice but then you always wind up picking thrown off on her and he said then when you do that it comes back to your love toward me why because the man that fellowship that relationship with his mother wasn't right when he was growing up it wasn't exactly right so he said well if i have i want to take care of that by the grace of god so he flew to california got around his mother he said every time he tried to hug her she'd turn away from him said he asked his sister one day why does mom do that you said jeff she was molested by her uncle when she was seven years old so her feelings toward men her feelings toward men she can't trust me then she started out started living promiscuous having all kinds of affairs and this mother and then what did it do scarred her then she come down and scarred hers and what was brother jeff doing scaring his wife do you understand what i'm saying church do you say how cruel satan is many of you you may stay here this morning you think god my daddy never done this my mama never done this but listen friend maybe they were scarred too without looking back and the prophet of god had the ability to go back generation after generation after generation and trace it down i don't have that ability this morning but if you're sitting here in something in your heart that way and you've been scarred let's say god by your help i want that to stop with me and not go on in another generation you sitting here many of you you've come from scarred backgrounds since you started serving the lord how many of you said under ministries that scarred your heart fell from the word of god fell into into some kind of doctrine that wasn't right or fell after money or fell after women and what did that do that put a scar on you some of you as much as you love me you still don't trust me and i couldn't understand that because you see once anybody ever gets a hold of her spirit good enough to scar it we put up a shield around us and we let no one come beyond that shield we trust no one that closely again we trust no one why it's a scar many of you said to you you know you've got them i've shared with you my experience as a child things that happened to me how it scarred me how it's affected me that even now in the message of the hour preaching the gospel filled with the holy ghost yet there's things that still recalls and brings back that scar i don't believe it's in the soul because i believe my soul is sealed with the holy ghost but where does it contain that in that realm of the human spirit you watch a girl that comes out of a home maybe her father committed adultery on a mother and you watch that girl she'll have a hard time ever fully trusting her husband why that scar was embedded so in her spirit if he comes in late from work where you been where you been well i had a flat tar sure you did what is it that scar surfacing if she sees a woman looking at him he may never do anything out of the way but because that is so scarred inside of her spirit it scarred so deeply her motivation she looks at it she watches why because that scar is so bulging out it is so pierced her spirit it's caused girl that was molested as a girl or as a young woman if god don't help that woman when she gets married she'll never be able to give herself to her husband in the right frame of mind because every time they come together in a carnal act that that that abuse that scar will come before her and she will hate anything associated with sex anything anything at all why that scar that scar embedded into her spirit and she comes up on the defensive oh there's many of the things that you and i have received we receive them by hereditary genetics that was given to us by mother and father but there's many of the things that we of god people have done it to us people i've been scarred by preachers i've been scarred by laity i love you my friends with all of my heart i love you i want to help you i want to help you beyond your scars but you see all of us if you're very old here this morning teenager you've probably been hurt by teenagers you've probably been heard by young people in this church and satan starts out so young trying to scar our lives let me read you a couple of them what's the cunningness of this enemy i probably said i see you you're 16 years old you're running as hard as you can run you've got a great big ribbon tighten your hand you've got a double plat hanging down the back you got to check her dress on you're running real fast there's a big yellow dog chasing him i want you to think this woman was maybe one opportunity in a lifetime to stand before the prophet of god and he tells her a dog chased her why in her spirit that fear is still there maybe her mind forgot about it as a matter of fact she said she did she said then she said another checkered dress and i said the young lady said she began to scream out and she was standing in front and said i had never thought of that in my life it was not just so much in the brain up here but it was laying there inside the spirit why do you think the prophet of god would try to contact people's spirit he wasn't reading their mind because their mind didn't know everything the mind does not have total recall it is not the brain that is scarred it is the spirit and he would contact your spirits matter of fact he said let this i've got to contact your spirit first so i can see what's happened in your life now if you repented from it there's something that's healed over god can't even show it to the prophet because it's done take care of but if it's something that's laying there that is a cause of something else oh you say what difference does it make friends scars can cause cancer scars can cause worry scars can cause nervousness scars can cause marriage problems financial problems and yet you look at it and you figure out and you try to figure out everything and you don't know the answer here is the answer to many people it's a scar that lives deep deep within him i want to tell you something some of you people you've been so hurt for preachers somebody used to didn't have no confidence in preachers at all i remember the johnson family when i first started getting around them and going preaching for them and stuff they were so scarred and so hurt and so wounded when i started preaching for them they want me to come up and i said well we'll take care of your motel room and give you offer and i said i'll come on one basis no offer i'll buy my gas and i'll buy my motel room that's the only reason and the only way i'll come because they've been around so many preachers because they had a business and they come around with their hands out like this give me give me kimmy amen and for a while i had to put up with some preacher jokes you know what i mean this offends y'all you know you know i preached this and preachers that and preacher the other but somehow i felt like whenever i met him that god because they don't know the times after i'd seen them in virginia or here or wherever it was that god would lay them on my heart and i'd wake up in different hours of the morning and night and god just put a burden out and go to praying for praying for them because i knew they had been so hurt and so offended and it was a scar laying there but i felt like don't take it the wrong way now i felt like that god had put in me a portion of the bomb of gilead and that god hallelujah not through me now because i can't do anything no more than you can but god listen friend how many people out there are hurting and maybe god could pour some bomb inside of you to be able to help somebody that's been scarred a lot of people don't think there's any christians anymore anymore that's living right but let god use you to prove to them that's not right scarred so embedded so so prevalent their lives wrapped around it but i've seen the holy spirit begin to take the word not my personality because i ain't got much i want but take that word and just begin to rub some ointment on that scar and they let down a little bit more every time i get around them let down a little bit more a little bit more a little bit more and many of you have been the same way you've been so hurt and so scarred do you think it's the personality of donnie reagan or some other man that could ever heal you i tell you no i don't have the ability and there is no other man that can heal you brother from scars is taking place inside of your heart and those scars may always be there but i don't think god wants it to be a constant open festering sower that is all the time gurgling out infection and putrefication but god wants it to be healed that we can put it behind us and call scarred human beings listen to this the first thing i read was 1950 this is another 1951 different individual you've had some really good teaching in your life but you've had many sorrows too you had a great scare one time in your life something happened to you when you was a school girl it was a dog i see him barking after you and you jumped and screamed it's when you was a child now that scarred that little girl's spirit she went to this doctor and that doctor and tried this and tried that and tried the other but it didn't lay so much in her body her body was only reflecting something that satan had attacked when she was wounded as a child i preached this up in ohio the lord gave it to me while i was gone and there was a minister brother been around the message for years and years and years he come to me after the service and he was crying and he said you know he said i i've had nervousness all in my life and he said i've never heard anything like this he never heard it replaced this way and he said well i sat there tonight he said something was brought back to my memory that i had that i hadn't even tied together in this way he said when i was a little boy a friend of mine we was camping out in the woods one night and he said the next morning when we come out there was some senior boys that come out from the highest school and he said they carried a double barrel shotgun and he said they loaded both barrels of that gun and they pulled back both hammers and they stuck it right to my face and that barrel laid right against my skin he said i've never been so scared in my life he said i trembled i shook i quivered he said but when i heard that word tonight he said i thought oh god maybe that's been the cause of my problem all these years that i didn't know what it was scars scores here's another one 1953 you've always been a little bit nervous when you was a little girl coming home from school that stinking low down rotten devil studying the makeup of human beings saying this demon would get on this dog to scare this person to scar their entire life he would watch another person with their makeup this same trick will work on them the same trick will work on them same trick will work on them and it scarred that individual and they carry that all of their life and not even know and realize what took place think of it satan anointed a dog exactly right and that dog come out and scared this little girl and now once in a lifetime opportunity stands before the prophet of god you don't say your name's on the book of life you have ordained you but this that the other but it goes back to way way way back to a deep deep scar because from that scar has come this and that and this and that and that expose the scar wash it by the bleeding word and the infections will leave are you hearing me this morning oh lord god hallelujah i see you coming from school and i see you going towards a dog and you got frightened by it way back he had on a little checking dress remember that it's all over now you can be made well what's that got to do it's been sick a scar and from that scar from this and this and this here's another one 1956. now the very thing that's here knows your life and i see you way back when you was a little girl you was running from something it was chasing you it was a dog you was coming from school and it scared you and you've been nervous all of your life now if an animal a blue beast could scar a human being what about someone called your mother someone calls your uncle that you're over at his house one day and he begins to do things with you as a little girl that isn't right if a dog anointed by a demon scholar human being's spirit what about a man that is called a pastor that feels he has so much liberty he can begin to date sisters and brother his wife take the money and do this and that and you trust him you have confidence in him when you find it out it puts a great big scar right across your spirit maybe not out loud but what they knew you say i'll never trust another man like that never i'll never have confidence that one another man this is it that's why some of you used to look at me and shake my hand but you've got that long distance look in your eye you know what scar i'm not asking you to make me you're absolute not at all you do that you're farther away from god than you was in the beginning but i can never help you if you don't have confidence in me that's right brother branham could never help us if we didn't have confidence that god's in his ministry friends don't look to me i'm not saying that at all you know what i'm saying you've heard me preach enough to know i'm not telling you to look at me but as long as satan by our scars i wonder this morning if we somehow would we could have a spiritual x-ray machine that would x-ray the spirit of human beings and only the spirit only the spirit and place before you here on a gigantic screen as you would pass under the spiritual x-ray for scars many of you would be scarred from one end of the other your memory has been scarred your conscience has been scarred your affection has been scarred some of you the reason you can't love your wife the way you ought to because you come from a family to word that the love wasn't right in your home and what are you doing you all the time accusing her she don't love me enough she don't love me enough she don't love me enough and many times friends it goes right back to them scars that a person received at a childhood and many people that have been all next mixed up in sexual promiscuity before they come to the word many times that thing will scar their life it'll scar their life and the devil will be there to torment you but i'm here to tell you this morning we have one that knows all about scars his name is jesus he was scarred by his friends leaving him he was scarred by the ministry turning him down he was kind by knowing human beings didn't care for him but he was able to stand there by it all and conquered every bit and that lord jesus is here to help you face your scars here's another one a boy now 1957. you're suffering from a nervous condition you've had it since she was a little boy since she was a kitty at school he got scared one time coming from school it was a dog crossed your path it's been many years ago i hear the prophet contacts this man's spirit the communication channel he looks searches by the spirit of god looks down inside that spirit imagination conscious memory reason affection what happens when a person loses their mind when they go insane their spirit actually roams remember the prophet of god talking about the woman and he had to go out there and get her spirit why you know why people go insane they don't have no memory memory don't lay on the brain amen it's not so much the brain that itself sure the spirit impregnates and puts it upon the organs it's in the body but it lays within the spirit the prophet said you have to go out there and search for their spirit and bring it back to their body that's why they can give people all kinds of medicine they can diagnose them with this and that and the other but they don't have the ability brother frank to go out there and contact that spirit and bring it back inside that body remember they're probably talking about the little girl that was up there in indiana and she lost her mind and he said he had to go out there and find her spirit and whenever the spirit of god helped him to contact this little girl's spirit she sat there and looked at him and said i'm brother random don't you remember me she just sat there and said don't you remember me you used to call me billy you was a little bitty girl and he said all of a sudden i caught the spirit and said ever since she was a little girl you've always wanted to marry a preacher and he said as soon as i said that that broke white down inside of that he caught that spirit roaming out yonder somewhere and he brought it back to the body and by that he was able to get a hold of that scar set her free you got real scared one time coming home from school you know what probably many of you today got scars when you went to school it was scars when bro boys would bring books to school that would display women's naked bodies you got to looking at things you shouldn't looked at the school you was exposed to cursing and foul language and it's so polluted and scarce i know what it's like to go to school and try to live for the lord i wasn't living in this message but whenever i was a young kid going to school them boys would bring all kinds of books to school because they tormented me every day there wasn't a day went by but they didn't torment me call me preacher call me moses call me holy roller call me all kinds of things they'd bring books i'd just be standing there at the locker standing in the lunchroom somewhere minding my own business they'd bring books and just hold them wide open and put them before my face i'd close my eyes they'd try to stick their fingers in my eyes and open my eyes i know what it can do but you see i had something even at that time that was greater than that scar they were able to imprint and i knew that it wasn't right to look at such stuff as that amen brother donnie but many of you maybe you didn't have that at that time in your life and it scarred you and because of that it even bothers you today even a haunts oh i hope somebody showed me this morning and then we look at it and we wonder god why can't i go on with you what is this problem in my marriage what is this problem in my life scars here's another little boy in 1963 a man standing in he says it's not for you sir it's for your little boy you believe god can tell me his trouble he's nervous it was caused from a dog scaring him a dog scares a boy affects his spirit a demon of nervousness comes and anoints that affection that that bruised part of that spirit you understand what i'm saying but here stands the word of god veiled in a man a prophet of malachi 4. and he said i want to tell you what your son's trouble is it's this and this but the cause is this see friends we so much of the time try to deal with symptoms me and my wife we fuss we argue i've got this problem with this and that's good that is only symptoms what is the cause and you come to find out let me just close we'll pick it up some other time many times people think they have forgiven people that have scarred their lives i like what brother ham said and humbled thyself in 1963 no matter what anybody ever does to you don't never hold nothing against them in your heart because if you do you will build a complex oh we're free from that are we apparently brother brown didn't know it apparently he didn't know it whenever he built one standing in the gap 1963 and he said i let the sick lay you imagine a prophet of god he was a human being i let the sick lay didn't even go pray for let him lay i built such a complex why people scarred his life people scored his life now you deal with scars from this side you laity ministry deals with it from another side you try to give your life to people and preach the gospel you hear people talk about your people in your own church you think my what am i doing what am i accomplishing you know what it is satan trying to take someone that maybe didn't even think when they said it or maybe whoever told it added to what they said and satan's trying to take that and scar your spirit so when you get up to preach it affects you when you study it affects you when you get ready to schedule meetings it affects you see scars scars and sometimes you can think i i forgive that person i know if i forgive them have we really it's hard i told you before the preacher molested me as a kid took me years in years and years to be able to look that man in the face and not want to mash his mouth it took me a long time to get to a place where i could look at that man not feel something raised up within me that i would want to kick him i'd want to hit him i'd want to just mash him in the face a scarf scar but today by the help of the lord i believe i can shake hands with that man i believe i can look him right in the face and so i feel no remorse towards you still it has put a scar that any time i'm alone with a brother when preachers come and pick me up at the airport and they turn a tape on they even move their hand it scares me i watch every move you know why that scar for a brief moment foreign praise jesus jesus wants to help you with this many of you if you could stand and take this microphone this morning you could tell them scars they would break the heart of the hardest person in the world really to hear your life what some of you been through mine's small compared to a lot of you but yeah you said this morning you know god it's true we can't go back and clear any of that record oh i wish i could [Music] just to be able to go beyond it because you see it affects you when it affects you if you're married it affects your mate when it affects you and her how can keep from affecting your children lord god as a child got out got wild know things in the world scarlet they come in church they love you you change their life that scar runs so deep in the human spirit lord god satan has been exposed this week lord as i said back to earth today we've been shaking under the impact of the holy ghost this morning before coming out and knowing that you were going to do something this morning lord god i pray you would help us today may we see lord may satan be exposed in every one of our lives and scarred us oh chill come here with my scars lord i've got into that lord that i don't even realize if i've got anything there lord that it causes this or that of the other please help me please help me today jesus remember the bad coffee talking about his father i drank and cursed him never speak to him never ever told him that he loved him her brother cop talked about his father and how he was raised and how he was raised in a home that was so cold and no love neither told him that they loved him and lord then i think him back just recently when one of the sisters of our church told me she always wanted a father that loved her lord what really breaks my heart is to know that her father comes to this church are we failing more we've been so scarred ourselves and we don't realize we're doing the same thing oh jesus jesus you're the great physician comedy heroes morning lord hear your wounded spirits broken confidence lord help them today that they can realize if that scar lord if that scar continues to dominate their life they are affecting their children by the very thing they hate and it will go on to the next generation and on to the next until someone can stand by the word and say i refuse for it to go any farther help us today lord help us oh jesus jesus hallelujah my god my god it's always open for you this morning if you just want to have a little talk with the lord you're scarred and you're wounded well i've spoken to you this morning something's come back up produced a funny feeling in your heart friend make sure you forgive that person that scarred you make sure you'll never be able to blot it out of your mind but make sure you forgive them make sure you forgive brother donnie was my dad he was my mama they've hurt me so bad but brother make sure you forgive don't don't carry that down to your son don't carry that down to your daughter forgive him let jesus heal your broken spirit this morning the scars that are so invaded oh lord god in the name of jesus christ i bind every devil that would try to hinder these people from moving lord being able to face themselves some people have a way of blocking it out god because if though it didn't happen oh i'm all right all right and never deal with it help them today lord not important so much that they come here but lord if they can just right there and their seat be able to deal with it god didn't realize they've been scarred and their scars affected them still help them i pray lord god the name of jesus in the name of jesus help us friend do you want to be a carer do you want your life to affect your child your grandchild the way you've been affected don't don't be one that i'm scarred be one that god can use to help heal many preachers in this message all they've done is produce scars and scars and more scars god forbid that i would cause anymore god knows that people have had enough but that i want to be one that can kind of help heal the scars help them to live not make more oh the holy spirit is here this morning just let him deal with your heart many of you was raised in bad homes and bad situations in cold homes and in different homes why don't you just say lord i've had a problem with it all of my life i need help today god i've not felt right toward my daddy toward my mama whoever it was somebody abused you as a child somebody molested you a preacher hurt you you say i can't do it you're right you cannot do it yourself but god can help you do it now let me show you something for him you watch people you watch them many people that come out of a horrible church split or where a pastor has spelled and offended the people you watch many of the people that come out of that assembly and you watch their attitude and you'll be able to follow their life a few years later and tell whether or not they forgive that man many of them will come down with cancer many of them will come down with nervousness many of them will come down with all kinds of things because they in their heart even though the man was wrong even though the man done wrong they themself was not able to forgive him and once you hold something within your spirit it scars your spirit it makes a way for satan to be able to attach himself to that point in your life then sickness disease nervousness this this this this keeps coming back and it all goes back to that one preacher that let you down and you've never been able to forgive him lord god lord god oh lord help us i i don't think that they realize i don't think they realize the importance of this lord help us today i don't know of anyone but i've got anything against but if there is anyone help me didn't know it then i can make it right i've been offended by people i've been scarred by people i've been scarred by preachers but if there's anyone that i ever forgive help me lord to be able to do it today lord god i know your presence is here and i believe with all of my heart you you give this to me to bring to the people today lord that they can be healed in your spirits be able to correct the things that are wrong help us us jesus i pray hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you're married folks you've got constant problems in your marriage in your life look back and see there's a cause for it to be there let the holy spirit search your heart this morning oh jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah my lord god we worship you don't be no hurry now we're right here in the presence of jesus the tender loving jesus you recommend this woman at the well got saved satan left her alone reckon he said well that's wonderful she's got saved she's given her heart to god there were scars that was embedded on her life no doubt she had to work on him for years to bring him subject to the word you think the prostitute walked out of there that day no problems the rest of her life she was a scarred individual and satan come right back you mean to think you believe you're one of them you filthy thing scars scars oh hallelujah but the tender loving jesus is able to help you don't let it go no farther friend if you come from a home that you wasn't loved don't pass that to your children and you that are sitting here today and maybe you're just beginning your home maybe you're just started maybe you're just getting started maybe your wife lives with child and you're just getting started oh brother listen listen to our past failures listen to our our past regrets let it stop in your home a home that doesn't have love let it stop there don't pass it on to your children don't let it go stop it stop it there don't let it go farther i know it may seem childish to you it may seem over that that is so simple yeah i agree with you that is simple but when i finally got married and started leaving home and just been recently in the last few years when i would go back to kentucky but i would see my daddy put his arm around me and say donnie i love you and i just almost have to run from him because it just i don't know what it is did you see him put his arms around me and tell me i love you and those of you that heard that all of your life you don't know what it's like you don't know what it's like but i don't plan on letting it go any farther i plan on being a pastor to you that can love you and that you can have confidence in america amen one that won't abuse you one that won't hurt you but one that'll point you toward christ hallelujah i want to help if i can if my purpose in life can never be much of anything and i know it probably won't be but if somehow when we get to the end of the week and the day of rewards are handed out and there's still the great men of god in this message that will be rewarded for great things they've done in jesus if i could just hear him say you helped heal a lot of my people they were so offended i sent them to your church from so many different states they've been messed up in doctrines and ideas and hurt the preachers and i sent him there you helped peter thousands of the great men brother tim from the mystical mother healed the man the great man that have done great works for god my reward may not be much but if i could hear you see you help him the daughter of my people that'll be worth it all to me friend now that's on the preacher level what about you is landing we got many hurting people that come to our church but just need a friend don't close them off don't close your little circle and have four or five people are
