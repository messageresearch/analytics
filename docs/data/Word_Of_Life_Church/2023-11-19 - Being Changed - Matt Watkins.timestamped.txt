[42:20] don't know where you're at and what
[42:22] stage you're at in your life and uh at a
[42:25] at a group like this they would be all
[42:27] at different spots of our journey I I
[42:29] would be go as far as to say that
[42:31] there's those here that are lost don't
[42:33] know the Lord some here that do know the
[42:35] Lord that have maybe been Justified
[42:37] maybe going through sanctification never
[42:39] been sealed by the Holy Ghost some of
[42:41] you been born again been baptized with
[42:43] the Holy Ghost and you're on your
[42:45] journey to to maturity and in in Christ
[42:48] so it doesn't matter what stage you're
[42:50] at the holy spirit will speak to every
[42:53] single person here if you'd have an ear
[42:54] to listen say Lord come and use brother
[42:57] Matt get him out of the way amen and
[42:59] come and speak to my heart I believe the
[43:01] Lord Jesus can do that so I'm here for
[43:03] you amen here just to be used and let
[43:06] the Holy Spirit speak to you I'm going
[43:08] to minister to you tonight and I'm going
[43:10] to title this being changed being
[43:14] changed Romans chapter 7 if you have
[43:16] your Bible let's open up there and read
[43:18] a portion of scripture and then we'll
[43:21] have you be
[43:22] seated
[43:25] amen
[43:30] now I've got notes here before me but
[43:33] you know brother Bram said it this way
[43:35] you operate the gift that God puts in a
[43:38] man's life so I've watched myself preach
[43:41] a sermon before and think I'm going to
[43:42] go One Direction but actually because
[43:45] the pool of the people I went completely
[43:47] off of my notes off of my outline and
[43:49] ended up preaching not even really what
[43:52] I thought I had laid out because that's
[43:54] the gift that you have is to operate the
[43:57] gift that God puts in another man Jesus
[44:00] actually didn't see that little woman
[44:03] father brother Bram said didn't show him
[44:04] that you know the little woman with a
[44:06] blood issue and brother bham says that
[44:08] the father had shown him everything but
[44:10] that little woman he didn't show him and
[44:13] that's why he said who touched me virtue
[44:15] left me brother bham says what was it
[44:18] she had a need in her life to touched
[44:20] Jesus and she Drew out from God what she
[44:24] needed from God when she reached out by
[44:26] faith and touched the Hemm of His
[44:28] Garment now if a little woman could do
[44:30] that how many believers do we have here
[44:32] to say Lord I'm going to draw out what I
[44:35] need I'm going to pull on the word of
[44:36] God and draw what I need I believe the
[44:38] Lord can can do that Hallelujah Romans
[44:41] chapter 7 let's just begin reading here
[44:45] and I just want to begin reading at
[44:47] verse 14 very familiar scripture for we
[44:50] know that the law is
[44:53] spiritual but I am carnal so sold under
[44:57] sin now I want you to notice very
[44:59] carefully and if you got to be careful
[45:02] when you read this because the Apostle
[45:04] Paul is going to refer to me and he's
[45:07] going to call himself me this is written
[45:09] to him but he's going to divide the way
[45:12] that he answers that if you could just
[45:13] mute that just here for a moment
[45:15] actually actually that's fine that's
[45:16] actually the scripture brother thank you
[45:18] that's good we could read it from there
[45:20] he's going to divide the way he answers
[45:23] me of who he is let's look at it here
[45:25] let's read that again
[45:26] uh uh let's read here just uh read that
[45:29] verse 16 again uh verse 15 for that
[45:32] which I do I allow not for what I would
[45:36] that do I not but what I hate that I
[45:40] do if then I do that which I would not
[45:44] or what I don't want to do I can s unto
[45:46] the law that it is good now then it is
[45:49] no more I that do it but sin that
[45:53] dwelleth in me for I know that in me how
[45:58] many can say
[46:00] me now are you any different than the
[46:03] Apostle Paul are you any more a human
[46:06] than he was a human I'll ask it this way
[46:09] are you any more Born Again than the
[46:11] Apostle Paul was born again no no and so
[46:16] notice the way he answers this for I
[46:17] know that in me
[46:21] parenthesis that is in my
[46:24] flesh dwelleth no good thing my goodness
[46:31] you mean nothing nothing brother Matt
[46:34] nothing I have nothing inside of me I
[46:36] mean I thought I was pretty bad but I
[46:38] got something good inside of me well you
[46:40] do if you got the baptism of the Holy
[46:43] Ghost but in this flesh Paul says I have
[46:47] no good thing for to will oh what a
[46:51] quandry that I can identify with for to
[46:54] will is Pres isn't with me but how to
[46:59] perform that which is good I find
[47:03] not for the good that I would I do not
[47:09] but the evil which I would not that I do
[47:13] how many have ever felt the way Paul
[47:15] just described now if I can do just one
[47:18] thing here tonight I've got a very
[47:19] simple uh uh uh burden upon my heart if
[47:23] I could help you understand you a little
[47:27] better because I believe that in
[47:29] understanding who we are that's where
[47:30] overcoming strength really comes
[47:33] from and so notice this here he says
[47:36] inside of me I want to do good I want to
[47:39] serve the Lord I I've got a desire how
[47:41] many would say I've got a desire to to
[47:42] only do with that which pleases the
[47:45] father how many would say that I only
[47:47] ever want to do what really inside of me
[47:49] brother man if I'd be honest I really
[47:51] ever want to please the Lord but that's
[47:53] not always the case that's right I've
[47:57] not found the secret notice Paul says
[47:59] this here and he says here I find the
[48:02] notice verse
[48:05] 21 I find then a law that when I would
[48:09] do good evil is present with me now how
[48:14] when just before you're born again no no
[48:17] no no evil is present with you at all
[48:21] times yes sir right evil is present with
[48:24] me for I I this here now he's going to
[48:26] speak about the spiritual man for I
[48:29] Delight in the law of God after the
[48:31] inward man but I see another law in my
[48:36] members
[48:38] Waring here's a war here's the battle
[48:40] you don't think you're in a battle let
[48:42] me wake you up tonight you're in a real
[48:43] struggle here tonight brother notice
[48:46] Paul he says for I find that a law and
[48:48] my members Waring against the law of my
[48:51] mind and bringing me into captivity to
[48:53] the law of sin which is in my members oh
[48:57] Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver
[49:00] me from the body of this death I thank
[49:03] God how many can thank god with Paul
[49:05] through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then
[49:08] with the mind I myself serve the law of
[49:10] God but with the flesh the law of sin if
[49:13] you have a need you just want to raise
[49:15] it and identify it amen to the Holy
[49:17] Spirit now as we bow our heads Lord
[49:19] Jesus we just ask you God to come in a
[49:22] special way Lord there's been so much
[49:25] preparation
[49:26] for this service these Services here
[49:27] this weekend I'm not even talking about
[49:30] Lord the physical things and the time
[49:32] and sacrifice that these young people
[49:34] have made some of the adults to prepare
[49:37] this and put this on Lord but I know
[49:39] there's mothers and fathers and there's
[49:41] a church that has asked you Lord God to
[49:43] move in a special way Lord we've prayed
[49:46] for these meetings now God I just ask
[49:49] one simple thing Lord help me just to
[49:51] get out of the way completely Lord I
[49:54] pray God that you would make make me
[49:55] sensitive to your spirit Lord if you'd
[49:58] want me to say something give me the
[50:00] courage to say it if you don't Lord then
[50:02] keep me from saying it oh God and I pray
[50:04] Lord for every person under the sound of
[50:06] my voice in this audience Lord may we
[50:09] just say right now holy spirit come and
[50:11] have Liberty in my life I pray God you'd
[50:14] Grant it to each and every single one of
[50:16] us in Jesus Christ's name amen you can
[50:19] be
[50:20] seated notice brother bham is going to
[50:22] get this questions and questions and
[50:24] answers and you can display that here
[50:27] and and he quotes this scripture I'll
[50:29] keep it on for a minute thank you
[50:30] brother he quotes this scripture here in
[50:32] Romans 7:14 again and he says we know
[50:36] that the law he's going to read this
[50:38] again uh that the law is spiritual but I
[50:40] am carnal sold under understand so
[50:43] here's this question that Paul that that
[50:46] that that here's this question this man
[50:48] has in the blue at the very end it's a
[50:50] very simple question this I cannot
[50:55] understand
[50:56] isn't it incredible after all of this
[50:58] everything that he could have asked
[50:59] brother brandom here was what was so
[51:01] upon his heart in other words I need
[51:04] help understanding this so you you what
[51:07] you're going to find is here in a minute
[51:09] is what the way brother brandham answers
[51:11] this is that there's more to you than
[51:14] what you see in the mirror there's more
[51:17] to you than what you've lived with all
[51:19] the days of your life there's more that
[51:21] that than what meets the eye that makes
[51:24] up Who You Are
[51:27] today listen how brother bandam answers
[51:29] this let me just kind of Polish it up so
[51:31] you can see he said in me is two persons
[51:37] you mean two people live inside of me am
[51:40] I schizophrenic brother Matt well in a
[51:42] way you really are you see brother bam
[51:44] said you're made up of body you're made
[51:46] up of spirit and you're made up of soul
[51:49] and in that body you have five senses
[51:51] you contact the natural world with but
[51:53] then in that Spirit here today I'm not
[51:56] talking about prior to being born again
[51:58] I'm talking about filled with the holy
[52:00] ghost from your head to your toes you've
[52:03] got a human spirit inside of you of
[52:06] memory and conscience and reasoning
[52:08] imagination affection all of these
[52:11] things make up who you are and all of
[52:14] your experiences in life the things that
[52:16] you go through the family that you're
[52:18] born into the kind of home that you grow
[52:20] up in not all of us grow up in the same
[52:22] type of home some of us here grow up in
[52:24] homes completely whole marriages a mom
[52:27] and dad not perfect by no means but a a
[52:30] marriage that where there's a union
[52:32] there but others grow up in broken homes
[52:34] with no dad uh no mother maybe that's
[52:37] you here tonight and you've grown up in
[52:39] a different circumstance than maybe what
[52:41] I did but notice all of your life
[52:44] experiences make up who you are all of
[52:47] your challenges all of the all of the
[52:50] struggles that you go through friends
[52:52] let me to say there are things that you
[52:53] will go through in your life that that
[52:55] I'll never have to go through but
[52:57] there's things in my life that I'll go
[52:59] through that you'll never have to go
[53:01] through the point is is that I can't
[53:03] walk down the road that God's called you
[53:05] to walk because God has anointed you in
[53:07] your life to meet the challenge of your
[53:10] of your life but God has called me in my
[53:12] life to meet the challenges and he's
[53:15] equipped me and he's equipped you for
[53:17] anything you go through in your life so
[53:20] there's more than just this then brother
[53:22] bandam says then down inside there's a
[53:25] soul and now that he would say it this
[53:28] way is the real
[53:30] you you mean this isn't the real me
[53:34] brother
[53:34] Matt this body that I look at in the
[53:37] mirror every single day and I comb my
[53:40] hair and I get dressed and and I try to
[53:42] look good and I try to keep you know
[53:45] this figure the the the looks that I
[53:47] have listen friends the prophet of God
[53:48] said this you've actually never seen
[53:51] each other that's right yes sir brother
[53:54] random says actually did you know we've
[53:56] never seen each other we've never seen
[53:59] what we really look like all we see is
[54:01] just this outward vessel this outward
[54:03] body brother bandam says but one day
[54:05] you'll see the real you you'll see the
[54:07] real each other friends I take courage
[54:09] in that because sometimes I look at this
[54:11] guy and this guy doesn't match this guy
[54:14] but I realize that down on the inside
[54:16] that's not really who I am who I am is a
[54:18] Believer I love the word I accept the
[54:22] word my Inside Man is the real me
[54:26] that's why the prophet of God said when
[54:28] you heard this message was Eagle food
[54:31] and you recognized it you heard from
[54:33] your
[54:35] theophany what was that that's the real
[54:37] you yes sir that's exactly
[54:40] Hallelujah notice this here brother
[54:42] bandam says this let me just kind of
[54:44] Polish it up so you can see he said in
[54:46] me is two people right one wants me to
[54:51] do he's going to say right wrong the
[54:53] other wants me to do right right right
[54:57] brother brandom you mean you had
[54:59] something inside of you that wanted you
[55:01] to do
[55:03] wrong every time I start to do right
[55:07] then the wrong hinders me how many of
[55:10] you people on the interviews this
[55:11] afternoon has run that same thing you
[55:15] you got an interview with the prophet of
[55:17] God and this is really what was on the
[55:19] hearts of people listen friends it
[55:21] wasn't some great mystery or some great
[55:23] you know ethereal thing or some great
[55:25] spiritual Revelation but what real
[55:27] people face is real people problems and
[55:30] what real people need is real people
[55:32] real answers from God that can answer
[55:35] real human
[55:36] battles this is what they were asking on
[55:39] the
[55:40] interviews has run the same thing this
[55:44] morning the same thing notice how can I
[55:47] take a Cocker bird this is the way
[55:49] brother brandom answers this and make a
[55:51] grain of wheat out of it it's impossible
[55:53] for me to do it let me pull it up on
[55:55] mine so I don't have to follow there and
[55:57] he says he says how can I do it it's
[56:00] impossible for me to do it the only way
[56:02] it can be is because inside that
[56:04] cockabur has been transmitted from a
[56:06] cckar wheat a cockabur to a germ called
[56:11] wheat life then you bury that cocko bur
[56:14] and it'll produce a grain of wheat
[56:16] that's right see because there has been
[56:19] a life of wheat put in the Cocker and
[56:22] the life of the Cocker has been taken
[56:25] out but the nature
[56:28] on the nature of the
[56:33] Cocker you mean this doesn't go away
[56:35] let's let let's let him let's let him
[56:36] answer it the nature of the Cocker is
[56:40] still sticky that's right it's still
[56:45] prickly it's still
[56:49] thorny it it's still a Cocker on the
[56:51] outside the nature of it and it will be
[56:55] until you are born of the Holy Ghost
[56:59] on come on can you say Amen to the
[57:02] word it will be until you finally repent
[57:05] and God finally fills you with enough of
[57:07] the Holy Ghost and then your Cocker bar
[57:09] will no longer be sticky all right and
[57:12] it will be until this new life has
[57:18] fully been
[57:20] developed out of the ground and raised
[57:24] up again so when will this when will it
[57:28] fully be developed when it comes out of
[57:31] the ground and raised up again what's he
[57:33] pointing to the resurrection you see
[57:36] friends what you've received is the
[57:37] earnest of the Holy Spirit what we have
[57:40] is a deposit a down payment something
[57:42] from Heaven that has came down to earth
[57:45] that's why you pull on the word of God
[57:47] that's why you believe the word of God
[57:48] listen you don't believe the message
[57:50] because of some good thing about
[57:52] yourself or because you studied it long
[57:54] enough or because you're anybody or
[57:56] better than anybody else there's one
[57:58] reason you're a Believer and that's
[58:00] because God put a seed Gene of God down
[58:03] inside of your soul so that you would
[58:05] recognize the word of the hour and you
[58:08] could say Amen to the word of the hour I
[58:11] don't say Amen because of anything good
[58:12] in me but there's an amener down on the
[58:15] inside of me I said there's a Believer
[58:17] down on the inside of me and I can't
[58:20] help but
[58:23] believe brother brand says notice this
[58:25] by the nature the nature of the Cocker
[58:28] is still sticky and it will be until
[58:32] this new life has fully been developed
[58:36] so brother bam says this here and and he
[58:38] no notice you notice this even from the
[58:40] scripture uh and in the Bible you notice
[58:43] the the the scripture makes it clear
[58:45] that there's two distinct life forces
[58:47] always at work if you could turn me up
[58:49] just a little bit on the monitor brother
[58:51] uh just a little bit there that'd be
[58:53] wonderful and so not notice this here
[58:56] the Bible makes it clear there's two
[58:57] distinct life forces let me just go
[59:00] ahead and cut to the chase if you
[59:02] thought you were a weirdo you
[59:06] are if you thought you was a little bit
[59:09] strange let me go ahead and just wake
[59:10] you up you are a little bit strange
[59:12] you're not normal you're not like
[59:14] everybody else in fact friends I'll go
[59:16] as far as to say if the world really
[59:18] knew really who you really are that
[59:20] think you was about as weird as you can
[59:22] get you tell some of think about it some
[59:25] of the things that bothered you some of
[59:27] the things that you struggle over and
[59:29] you repent over and say Lord I'm so
[59:31] sorry I made I'm so sorry I lost my
[59:33] temper Lord I I I'm so sorry I did that
[59:36] I shouldn't have said that God do you
[59:37] realize that to to those things that
[59:40] seem so large and so great and so
[59:43] massive to you to the world they look at
[59:45] that and go really really that's what's
[59:48] bothering you you're really stressed out
[59:50] over that just a little thing come on
[59:52] that that that's so small that's so ins
[59:54] significant and to them really it is
[59:56] insignificant you mean you're bothered
[59:58] over letting the Lord come on don't you
[1:00:00] as long as you love the Lord I mean God
[1:00:02] sees your heart he knows your life God
[1:00:05] does it doesn't matter if you drink a
[1:00:07] little bit you know a little social
[1:00:08] drink there I mean you're not getting
[1:00:09] drunk you're just drinking just a little
[1:00:12] bit you mean you don't even have a
[1:00:13] television in your
[1:00:15] home come on what what's wrong with a
[1:00:17] little bit you're going to hear cursing
[1:00:18] all day you mean you won't watch that
[1:00:20] movie do you realize that if you started
[1:00:22] telling I'm talking about real Believers
[1:00:24] here
[1:00:25] if you really started sharing some of
[1:00:27] your convictions and how you live they
[1:00:29] look at you and say man you are
[1:00:30] stressing over nothing you know what's
[1:00:32] different about them and about me is
[1:00:34] that God they can somehow get away with
[1:00:36] it but there's something inside of you
[1:00:39] that won't let you get away with it
[1:00:41] there's something inside of you that
[1:00:43] when you mess up God convicts your heart
[1:00:45] there's something inside of you that
[1:00:47] says you're not called to that you're
[1:00:49] not called to be like the rest of the
[1:00:51] world you're a believer of the word of
[1:00:53] the hour you're a believer in the
[1:00:55] message of the hour and you can't get
[1:00:57] away from
[1:00:59] it let me go ahead and tell you you
[1:01:01] can't get away from it yes sir you can
[1:01:04] run but you won't outrun God if there's
[1:01:07] a seed Gene of God down inside of you
[1:01:09] you will be miserable trying to fit in
[1:01:12] to a world you weren't made to fit
[1:01:15] in there nothing more miserable than a
[1:01:17] believer seion of God trying to fit in
[1:01:20] with the rest of the world you'll never
[1:01:22] do it God will never stop coming after
[1:01:25] you thank God for that kind of
[1:01:28] Grace notice this so he says there's two
[1:01:31] of me there's two distinct life forces
[1:01:34] down on the inside of me one wants me to
[1:01:37] do good the other wants me to do evil
[1:01:41] and brother bandam says it this way that
[1:01:43] there's even an angel do you realize
[1:01:46] this that even when you're born you're
[1:01:49] born with an angel a guardian angel over
[1:01:51] your life brother brandom answers this
[1:01:53] he ask it several times in in in the
[1:01:55] message you could go look this up and he
[1:01:57] quotes the scriptures the angels that
[1:01:59] behold my father's face and brother
[1:02:00] Madam says sure brother mam do you
[1:02:02] believe in angels absolutely there's an
[1:02:04] angel of God listen friends there's an
[1:02:06] angel over your life at all times that's
[1:02:11] right yes sir but just like there's an
[1:02:13] angel over your life there's a demon
[1:02:16] spirit that tries to anoint you and
[1:02:18] influence your life also brother Brandon
[1:02:20] would even say that there was a demon
[1:02:22] spirit that hung over his life
[1:02:25] that prevented him from giving his heart
[1:02:27] to the Lord long before he did that's
[1:02:30] right and he said a spirit hung over me
[1:02:33] notice it was a spirit trying to prevent
[1:02:35] him from coming to his
[1:02:40] identity now if a spirit would try to
[1:02:42] prevent a prophet from coming to his
[1:02:45] identity how much do you think a demon
[1:02:47] Spirit would try to anoint your life
[1:02:50] preventing you from seeing who you
[1:02:51] really
[1:02:53] are I'm going to preach on that just
[1:02:55] here for a moment you find brother
[1:02:57] brandham saying that over and over a
[1:02:58] dark Spirit hung over me he would go to
[1:03:02] prayer lines and he would he would call
[1:03:03] out and say sister I see a dark shadow
[1:03:06] hanging over your life it's amazing he
[1:03:09] always said it this way a dark shadow in
[1:03:11] another place he would call it a dark
[1:03:13] cloud something that we couldn't see but
[1:03:17] was very much
[1:03:18] real something that with our own eyes
[1:03:21] you say but the matter I don't see it
[1:03:22] that doesn't make it not real in fact
[1:03:25] those things are more real than what you
[1:03:26] see here and now yes sir that's exactly
[1:03:29] right listen faith brother brandom said
[1:03:31] faith is the six sense that six sense
[1:03:34] that a Believer has when he's born of
[1:03:36] the spirit of God calls those things
[1:03:38] that are not as though they are that's
[1:03:41] right that's the real faith of a
[1:03:43] Believer so it doesn't matter if you
[1:03:45] can't see it it's really real and
[1:03:47] there's a spirit that can come over your
[1:03:49] life that's always there you say brother
[1:03:52] Matt when are those two Spirits one
[1:03:54] trying to work the good one trying to
[1:03:56] work the evil they're there all the time
[1:03:58] right right sure they're there trying to
[1:04:01] prevent you from coming to a new birth
[1:04:04] that they're trying to bind you and
[1:04:05] afflict you with addictions and and and
[1:04:07] issues of your flesh they're trying to
[1:04:09] deceive you they're trying to destroy
[1:04:11] you they're trying to pervert your mind
[1:04:13] and Destroy uh distort your view of
[1:04:16] God I don't think we realize sometimes
[1:04:19] how real that other dimension really
[1:04:22] is but the prophet of God said it was a
[1:04:25] very real Dimension and so notice
[1:04:28] there's two Spirits always at work one
[1:04:30] Spirit an angel brother bandam says let
[1:04:32] me get back to that do you believe in an
[1:04:34] angel a guardian angel brother Brom says
[1:04:35] absolutely a a ministering Spirit or an
[1:04:38] Angelic spirit that would be there
[1:04:40] throughout your entire life listen
[1:04:42] friends that same angel that ministers
[1:04:44] to you is the same one who Woos on you
[1:04:47] and he calls on you and he pulls at you
[1:04:50] that tug that you feel is an angel from
[1:04:53] sent from God trying to pull you to
[1:04:55] surrender your life yes amen thank you
[1:04:59] Lord and at the same exact time while an
[1:05:01] angel's pulling this way another Angel a
[1:05:04] fallen angel a demon spirit is trying to
[1:05:06] put a dark cloud over your
[1:05:09] life to keep you from the identity of a
[1:05:12] son or daughter of God that you really
[1:05:15] are and so brother Randon would say that
[1:05:17] there's a spirit always there trying to
[1:05:20] trying to prevent him and he said there
[1:05:22] was a spirit that said Oh Come come on
[1:05:24] you got you got all your life you got
[1:05:26] all the time in the world you got plenty
[1:05:28] of time to get right with God that's the
[1:05:30] spirit that hung over brother bram's
[1:05:32] life that prevented him from coming to
[1:05:34] the New Birth before he did
[1:05:36] that's are you with me here tonight and
[1:05:39] so notice he says and as long as you're
[1:05:42] in this life let me find it here as long
[1:05:45] as you're in this life how many are
[1:05:47] still in this
[1:05:49] life as long as you're in this life
[1:05:53] you're going to be sticky and have a
[1:05:56] carnal nature that's going to bother you
[1:05:59] as long as you
[1:06:03] live but the inside you you're born
[1:06:07] again sir you say brother Matt when am I
[1:06:10] going to be changed when is the struggle
[1:06:12] I'm preaching to you on being changed
[1:06:15] when is it going to finally end when am
[1:06:17] I finally going to be really changed
[1:06:20] well let me say this God changes you but
[1:06:23] it's not just important that you're
[1:06:25] changed but it's more important that
[1:06:27] you're
[1:06:29] changing you say when is it going to end
[1:06:31] when is this when is the struggle when
[1:06:34] am I finally going to be changed let me
[1:06:36] say it this way when you turn 18 for the
[1:06:39] second time it'll be
[1:06:42] over some of you that ain't 18 now don't
[1:06:45] worry one day you'll be about 18 19
[1:06:47] years old and that life that you live
[1:06:49] now will be fully developed into the
[1:06:52] Life of Christ that's why Paul said said
[1:06:54] we know not what we shall be when he
[1:06:55] appears but we know this we shall be
[1:06:57] like him in his very
[1:07:00] image that's right but but meanwhile
[1:07:03] I've got this struggle brother B says
[1:07:05] when you're raised up you're in the
[1:07:06] likeness of Christ and all the sin is
[1:07:07] gone from you that's the
[1:07:09] thing so notice brother bandam types
[1:07:12] this and he says it's going to be in
[1:07:14] your life now watch the way he continues
[1:07:16] to answer this question somebody told me
[1:07:19] he once he's speaking of this Indian
[1:07:20] chief that brother Billy Paul lets
[1:07:23] through the prayer line and he and he's
[1:07:24] saying me sick me sick and brother
[1:07:27] brother Billy can't get it out of him
[1:07:28] he's sick and he goes through the prayer
[1:07:29] line brother Bon refers back to him and
[1:07:31] says somebody told me at one time he was
[1:07:34] converted he received the Holy Ghost and
[1:07:36] he said to him hey how you getting along
[1:07:40] and he said pretty good and pretty bad
[1:07:44] you know if you'd be honest and I asked
[1:07:46] you how you doing that's how you'd
[1:07:47] answer
[1:07:48] to how you doing pretty
[1:07:51] good pretty bad
[1:07:54] and he says and he said pretty good and
[1:07:56] pretty bad and he said 'well how do you
[1:07:58] mean pretty good and pretty bad he said
[1:08:01] well since me receive the Holy Ghost
[1:08:05] there's been two dogs in me and one of
[1:08:09] them a black dog and one of them a white
[1:08:11] dog and said they argue all the time
[1:08:17] yeah that's
[1:08:18] right they argue all the time said they
[1:08:21] growl and they fight at one another and
[1:08:23] said the white dog wants me to do good
[1:08:26] but the black dog wants me to do bad
[1:08:28] said well Chief which one of them wins
[1:08:31] the fight said that depends on which one
[1:08:34] Chief feeds the most that's right so I
[1:08:38] think that's a good answer here see
[1:08:40] there just depends on the Waring of the
[1:08:44] body that's in
[1:08:46] you it depends on which one you cater to
[1:08:52] which nature you cater to the carnal
[1:08:55] nature after the things of the world or
[1:08:58] the spiritual nature after the things of
[1:09:00] God that does
[1:09:03] it oh no no no I got to have a more
[1:09:06] complicated answer than that it's just
[1:09:08] that simple which one do you
[1:09:12] feed will determine which one will win
[1:09:15] inside of you how many here want to be
[1:09:17] Overcomers how many here want to be
[1:09:19] Victors how many want victory over sin
[1:09:21] in your life in every aspect in area of
[1:09:24] life well which one are you feeding this
[1:09:27] man or this
[1:09:30] man it never ceases to amaze me that
[1:09:33] sometimes the very thing that we want
[1:09:35] free of is the very thing that we feed
[1:09:37] the
[1:09:40] most I said the very thing we want Fe
[1:09:42] free from do we realize sometimes that
[1:09:45] anxiety that we want so delivered from
[1:09:47] do we realize it's the things that we
[1:09:49] ingest inside of our spirit that
[1:09:52] sometimes feeds that depression
[1:09:55] how many of you here have Instagram go
[1:09:57] ahead and raise your hand it's all right
[1:09:58] it's all right don't be ashamed but
[1:09:59] don't lie whatever you do you got
[1:10:01] Instagram raise your hand it's all right
[1:10:03] see everybody everybody's raising their
[1:10:05] hand it's okay I got a question for you
[1:10:07] ask the same question back home how many
[1:10:09] of you have Tik Tock now I don't even
[1:10:11] know what that is but uh I know that
[1:10:14] it's an app I don't have it Tik Tok how
[1:10:15] many that's
[1:10:16] fine H how many of you have a smartphone
[1:10:19] let's get real honest
[1:10:21] here
[1:10:22] right now how many of you have a
[1:10:25] personal copy of the Seven Seals
[1:10:29] book Church age book it's good now let
[1:10:33] me ask you if the Instagram is called a
[1:10:36] feed and Facebook is called a feed do
[1:10:40] you realize that it's intentionally that
[1:10:42] way it's feeding you something then what
[1:10:44] do you think this does when you scroll
[1:10:46] through this sometimes what's it doing
[1:10:49] it's feeding you something one's feeding
[1:10:51] you one thing this one's feeding you
[1:10:53] another what you got to do is start out
[1:10:56] what's feeding the wrong thing and start
[1:10:58] feeding the right thing you want more of
[1:11:01] God feed more of God you want more of
[1:11:03] the power of God feed on the things that
[1:11:05] give
[1:11:06] it
[1:11:09] hallelujah it's amazing to me how much
[1:11:12] we don't realize the very thing that is
[1:11:15] giving us our anxiety is the very thing
[1:11:18] that we're
[1:11:18] feeding got a question how many times
[1:11:21] have you looked through insta you don't
[1:11:22] have to answer how many times if you
[1:11:23] scrolled through your feed and after you
[1:11:25] get done scrolling through your feed you
[1:11:27] felt stressed you felt worried you felt
[1:11:29] anxiety well I'm going to answer for you
[1:11:31] I guarantee you whether you realize it
[1:11:32] or not you go feeding I can just feed
[1:11:35] through Fox News and and and there will
[1:11:37] be fear upon me stress upon me anxiety
[1:11:40] and worry that wasn't there
[1:11:41] before and you feed on those kind of
[1:11:44] things and you get stressed and you get
[1:11:46] worried and you get bothered and you get
[1:11:48] anxiety of what you don't have what you
[1:11:50] could have what this person's doing do
[1:11:51] you realize friends it's a rat
[1:11:56] race and how many times do you feed on
[1:11:59] those things and then you say my I'm so
[1:12:01] depressed my I've got so much anxiety
[1:12:03] I've got so much worry and you don't
[1:12:05] realize the very thing that you want
[1:12:07] free of is the very thing you're feeding
[1:12:10] I got news for you I've never turned off
[1:12:12] a tape of the prophet and felt anxiety
[1:12:15] I've never turned off the tape of God's
[1:12:17] Prophet I never felt depressed I've
[1:12:19] never felt stressed I've never felt word
[1:12:21] clacked actually the opposite I felt
[1:12:23] encouraged I felt strengthened I felt
[1:12:26] picked up I felt like I can I'm going to
[1:12:28] make it I felt like greater is he that
[1:12:30] is in me than he that is in the world
[1:12:32] it's time to stop feeding the wrong
[1:12:34] things and start feeding the seed that
[1:12:37] God put on the inside of you can you
[1:12:40] give the Lord another hand clap of
[1:12:41] Praise he's worthy of
[1:12:43] that
[1:12:47] Hallelujah notice this in greatest
[1:12:49] battle ever fought he says a devil is
[1:12:52] almost harmless unless he can have
[1:12:56] something to work
[1:12:59] in he's got you remember those Devils
[1:13:01] that were cast out of Legion they had
[1:13:03] they wanted to do more mischievousness
[1:13:06] so they wanted to go into the Hogs so
[1:13:08] Devils must have something to work in
[1:13:13] somebody to work through all right Satan
[1:13:17] his power he's God is the perverted
[1:13:20] power of God everything Satan is got is
[1:13:21] power something that was perverted but
[1:13:23] it's a power and we are today sitting
[1:13:26] here and one or the other power is going
[1:13:30] to control
[1:13:32] us so let's cast out the evil
[1:13:35] one let's take our position like the
[1:13:37] stars of the heavens so notice this
[1:13:40] inside of the body is a soul and that
[1:13:42] soul is controlled by imagination
[1:13:44] conscience memory reason affections
[1:13:46] that's the thing that controls the soul
[1:13:49] uh so he says that's the thing that
[1:13:51] controls the soul so notice you say
[1:13:53] brother Matt what's he saying here in
[1:13:54] questions and answers let me pull it
[1:13:56] back up I lost it here for a second and
[1:13:58] he says inside of the body is of Soul
[1:13:59] it's controlled by imagination conscious
[1:14:01] memory that's the thing that controls
[1:14:03] the soul then what does that from the
[1:14:07] middle of the
[1:14:10] heart from the middle of the heart which
[1:14:12] is the soul from There Goes Forth
[1:14:15] feeding every
[1:14:19] channel you say how much access brother
[1:14:22] Matt I'm Bor Bor of the spirit of God
[1:14:24] been baptized with the Holy Ghost I want
[1:14:26] to know how much access does the devil
[1:14:28] have to me now all right as much as you
[1:14:33] give
[1:14:36] him I said as much as you give
[1:14:40] him why am I struggling why why why why
[1:14:43] is this bothering me why is this
[1:14:44] tripping me up why do I come back to the
[1:14:46] same spot over and over and over again
[1:14:49] how much access are you giving the
[1:14:52] devil no notice this he says from the
[1:14:54] middle of the Heart It Goes Forth
[1:14:56] feeding every channel the trouble of it
[1:14:58] is we're standing here with a lot of
[1:15:00] Doubt trying to accept what's out there
[1:15:02] you've got to stop that and come down
[1:15:04] that Channel with the true word of God
[1:15:07] then it goes out itself automatically
[1:15:10] it's what's on the inside that's the
[1:15:13] thing that counts is the inside Satan's
[1:15:17] approach is from the
[1:15:22] inside a
[1:15:24] ha
[1:15:26] aha you mean Satan doesn't actually all
[1:15:29] the attacks that I feel in my flesh you
[1:15:32] know let me say what I said last night
[1:15:34] the devil realizes he can never get to
[1:15:36] your soul if you're sealed by the Holy
[1:15:38] Ghost yes sir so he say brother matth
[1:15:41] what does he move through memory
[1:15:43] conscience reasoning
[1:15:46] complexes bitterness sure
[1:15:49] on division right yes sir you give give
[1:15:55] Satan an inch he'll take a
[1:15:58] mile you say what access do does he have
[1:16:01] as much as you give him it's what's on
[1:16:03] the inside brother random says you got
[1:16:04] to clean out the channels notice this
[1:16:07] here so his approach is from the inside
[1:16:10] he attacks us from the inside here see
[1:16:12] it's what's cover covered over with you
[1:16:14] say well now here see what it's covered
[1:16:16] over with you say well now well these
[1:16:19] conscience and senses and so forth I
[1:16:22] don't have any anything to do with it
[1:16:24] brother
[1:16:25] brandom certainly it
[1:16:28] does you mean that
[1:16:31] matters you mean it's not just get the
[1:16:33] Holy Ghost just get get get get the Holy
[1:16:35] Ghost be born again I believe in all of
[1:16:37] that friends absolutely but let me tell
[1:16:39] you that's only when the battle really
[1:16:40] begins yes sir that's right and brother
[1:16:44] Adam says notice this here you feed
[1:16:46] every channel your memory conscience
[1:16:50] reasoning imagination that doesn't
[1:16:52] matter certainly it does does notice but
[1:16:54] if you let the word come in and cover it
[1:16:58] over with conscience then it can't
[1:17:02] grow you let the word in accept the word
[1:17:07] believe the word but then cover it over
[1:17:10] with a
[1:17:12] grudge cover it over with malice come on
[1:17:16] somebody covered over with jealousy you
[1:17:19] think these things don't affect us oh
[1:17:20] they do covered over with jealousy with
[1:17:24] anger oh it does that really doesn't
[1:17:26] matter I mean all that really matters
[1:17:28] brother matter is just that I'm born of
[1:17:29] the spirit of God whether I have a
[1:17:31] temper or not God doesn't really care
[1:17:32] about that oh
[1:17:34] really we can emphasize one and I've
[1:17:37] always found people will either
[1:17:39] emphasize one thing only to deemphasize
[1:17:41] another thing and brother bandom said
[1:17:44] that what is the gift what is the
[1:17:45] evidence of the baptism of the Holy
[1:17:47] Ghost you know the Lord I'm just going
[1:17:49] to take just a moment here to to say
[1:17:51] this because the Lord just is so
[1:17:53] impressed it upon my heart even while I
[1:17:55] was driving up here and I've argued with
[1:17:56] the Lord asking him uh you know do Lord
[1:17:59] do you you really sure you want me to go
[1:18:00] to to say that and so I'm going to I'm
[1:18:02] just going to go here just a moment
[1:18:03] because I believe that one of the
[1:18:05] greatest quandries that the devil can
[1:18:07] have so much victory in people's lives
[1:18:10] is do I have the Holy
[1:18:13] Ghost any of y'all ever asked that
[1:18:15] question oh yeah am I sure brother
[1:18:18] bandham they would ask him over again
[1:18:19] brother bam I just I want to know I want
[1:18:22] to know you know let me just say this
[1:18:24] brother bham never emphasized uh brother
[1:18:26] bam never emphasized a gift to speak in
[1:18:29] tongues or a gift to shout or brother
[1:18:32] random would always stand in the middle
[1:18:33] of two sides yes sir and you always find
[1:18:37] that people will emphasize one thing
[1:18:40] only to deemphasize another thing yes
[1:18:42] sir they'll either deify the words of
[1:18:45] brother
[1:18:47] brandom or they'll deemphasize the words
[1:18:50] of brother Bon right in fact this is the
[1:18:54] exact battle that brother brandham stood
[1:18:56] in his entire Ministry always in between
[1:18:59] two
[1:19:01] ditches
[1:19:03] hello always in between two ditches and
[1:19:06] so he would always argue with the
[1:19:08] Pentecostals always always have to
[1:19:11] always have to hit at them about about
[1:19:13] majoring on speaking my tongues but
[1:19:15] brother Brandon would stand right in the
[1:19:16] middle of both you had the Baptist Triad
[1:19:20] confession
[1:19:21] intellectuals who brother random would
[1:19:23] say would have the fruits of the spirit
[1:19:25] that have the nature of Christ they'd be
[1:19:28] kind sweet loving
[1:19:33] affectionate but they they denied the
[1:19:36] spirit then brother V said then you had
[1:19:38] the Pentecostal over here on this side
[1:19:40] and he's just shouting dancing jumping
[1:19:42] screaming having a good old time but
[1:19:44] he's got a temper enough to fight a buzs
[1:19:48] saw you say well then which side was
[1:19:51] brother beram in the fruits of the
[1:19:52] spirit or the gifts of the Spirit
[1:19:57] both you see just because brother bham
[1:19:59] said that the fruits of the spirit are
[1:20:01] not the evidence of the Holy Ghost it
[1:20:04] doesn't mean that the Holy Ghost won't
[1:20:06] produce the fruits of the
[1:20:09] spirit if we want to believe that then
[1:20:11] we've got to believe he did just let me
[1:20:13] get let me take it the other way just
[1:20:15] because brother brandham didn't believe
[1:20:17] that speaking in tongues was the
[1:20:19] evidence of the Holy Ghost doesn't mean
[1:20:21] that brother brandham didn't believe
[1:20:22] believe that the Holy Ghost speaks in
[1:20:25] tongues but people always want to Major
[1:20:28] on one thing emphasize one thing but
[1:20:32] deemphasize
[1:20:34] another you say well then which one do
[1:20:36] we need brother Matt you need all of it
[1:20:39] that's right amen I said you need every
[1:20:43] single bit of
[1:20:45] it and so brother Brandon would say this
[1:20:47] let me just answer this question what is
[1:20:49] the evidence of the Holy Ghost I was
[1:20:51] asked one time what I thought I don't
[1:20:53] have this about the initial evidence of
[1:20:55] the Holy Ghost was speaking was it
[1:20:57] speaking in tongues I said no can't see
[1:20:59] that he said neither do I said though
[1:21:03] I've been taught that and said what
[1:21:04] would you think would be an Evidence I
[1:21:07] said the most perfect evidence I could
[1:21:10] think of is
[1:21:13] love now even brother bramman himself
[1:21:16] notice how he said it the best evidence
[1:21:18] I could think of was love sounded
[1:21:23] good and he says and so we got to
[1:21:26] talking on that and then I thought huh
[1:21:28] that sounded pretty good so I just held
[1:21:31] that if a man's got love but one day yes
[1:21:36] one day in a vision brother bam says one
[1:21:39] day the Lord in a vision straightened me
[1:21:41] out on that and he said I'm just going
[1:21:45] to tell you what he said cuz really it
[1:21:47] doesn't matter what I say what you say
[1:21:49] what another person says all that really
[1:21:51] matters is what he he says and he said
[1:21:55] that the evidence of the spirit was
[1:21:57] those who could receive the word that's
[1:22:00] right neither love nor speaking in
[1:22:02] tongues but it's receiving the word
[1:22:06] that's exactly right thank you Lord now
[1:22:09] let me go further because I'm already
[1:22:11] here might as well preach as brother
[1:22:12] Andrew Glover
[1:22:14] says let me go a little bit further
[1:22:16] brother Brandon would say now neither
[1:22:18] one notice that let's read it again the
[1:22:20] evidence is accepting the word
[1:22:23] receiving the word notice and then he
[1:22:25] was saying to me that that's scriptural
[1:22:28] he said because in John 14:26 when he
[1:22:31] the Holy Ghost is coming to you he will
[1:22:32] reveal the things to to you that I've
[1:22:34] taught you and will show to you things
[1:22:36] to come so there is the genuine evidence
[1:22:39] of the Holy Ghost he's never told me
[1:22:41] anything wrong yet that is it the
[1:22:43] evidence of the Holy Ghost is he who can
[1:22:46] believe the word you can receive
[1:22:51] it yes
[1:22:53] now many people brother brandham said
[1:22:54] here in this Pentecostal audience if I
[1:22:56] was to ask you how many here have the
[1:22:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost he said I
[1:23:01] guarantee you every single hand 99% of
[1:23:03] the hands would go up brother Ram says
[1:23:05] but I can show you by just quoting one
[1:23:09] scripture and ask you do you have this
[1:23:11] evidence in your life just one scripture
[1:23:13] if the evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[1:23:15] being able to say Amen to every word of
[1:23:18] God I said every word not just the part
[1:23:22] you like not just the part brother Matt
[1:23:23] likes not just the part that I would
[1:23:25] emphasize or you would emphasize but all
[1:23:28] of the word of
[1:23:32] God brother bam says I'd ask you do you
[1:23:34] have the Holy Ghost if they if that be
[1:23:36] he said every hand go up he said now I
[1:23:38] can prove to you I could quote just one
[1:23:40] scripture and I guarantee you there
[1:23:42] wouldn't be two or three hands at the
[1:23:43] most would go up wow and you know the
[1:23:46] scripture he quotes those that sigh and
[1:23:49] cry for the Abominations done in the
[1:23:52] city
[1:23:53] the prophet says how many of you lose
[1:23:56] sleep at night sighing and crying over
[1:23:59] the Abominations done for the lost and
[1:24:01] the dying that are in the world oh but I
[1:24:04] shouted I danced I jumped I scream oh
[1:24:06] but I I've got all the fruits over here
[1:24:08] but listen friends it's all of the word
[1:24:11] or it's none of the word yes sir and the
[1:24:14] prophet of God says notice this here but
[1:24:16] how about you that would really sigh and
[1:24:19] cry over the Abominations done
[1:24:23] in this
[1:24:26] city notice can we go a little bit
[1:24:29] further brother B says see it's covered
[1:24:31] over with you say well now you say well
[1:24:34] let me get something straight here you
[1:24:35] say brother the matter you preach it
[1:24:36] against fruits nope you preach it
[1:24:38] against the fruits of the spirit love
[1:24:40] absolutely not preaching against dancing
[1:24:41] and and and shouting absolutely not let
[1:24:44] me give you the way that brother
[1:24:44] brandham says that's just what a normal
[1:24:46] Christian
[1:24:49] does you say is that the evidence it's
[1:24:51] not the evidence
[1:24:53] it's just what a normal Christian does
[1:24:55] if you're a human being brother random
[1:24:57] says human beings don't go live in trees
[1:24:59] they don't jump out of trees thinking
[1:25:00] they could fly cuz that's not what human
[1:25:02] beings does human beings Works they have
[1:25:04] a wife they have a home he says that's
[1:25:07] what the normal human does then what
[1:25:09] does a normal believer do he shouts he
[1:25:12] can Rejoice he can speak in tongues he
[1:25:15] also loves he also forgives he also has
[1:25:18] the love and the nature of Christ that's
[1:25:21] right amen amen he has all of it good
[1:25:25] right notice it's covered over with you
[1:25:28] say well now well the conscious
[1:25:29] certainly does it'll be notice this
[1:25:31] brother random says but if you let the
[1:25:33] word come in and cover it over with
[1:25:36] conscience then it can't grow now listen
[1:25:40] as we take a turn here it'll be a
[1:25:43] deformed
[1:25:45] word did you ever see a good grain of
[1:25:47] corn planted in the ground and let a
[1:25:48] stick fall over it it'll grow crooked
[1:25:52] any Vine anything that grows up will
[1:25:54] because something has hindered it
[1:25:57] something has hindered it something has
[1:26:01] fallen upon a good
[1:26:03] grain something that it didn't ask
[1:26:06] for but brother Ram says in another
[1:26:09] place he talks about this I think it was
[1:26:10] a stock of corn and he said all of them
[1:26:12] were just growing up perfectly but this
[1:26:14] one it was it had grown crooked this
[1:26:17] thing had fallen over a branch had
[1:26:19] fallen over when it was young and
[1:26:21] growing and he says a branch had fallen
[1:26:23] over it and that Branch began to grow
[1:26:25] left and right and crooked and this way
[1:26:27] what had happened why didn't it grow up
[1:26:30] like the rest of the stalks because
[1:26:32] something had fallen upon it and
[1:26:35] deformed its
[1:26:38] life now I'm going to say here I'm just
[1:26:40] going to cut to the chase as I'm
[1:26:42] preaching to you and being changed
[1:26:43] friends let me just say this to you
[1:26:45] tonight it is wonderful that you you
[1:26:47] need to be changed let me say it this
[1:26:50] way thank you Lord the Holy Ghost ghost
[1:26:52] in your life will change
[1:26:56] everything in fact Paul said he that is
[1:26:59] in Christ is a new
[1:27:02] creation but let me say it this way the
[1:27:05] Holy Ghost doesn't change
[1:27:11] everything say how can you say that
[1:27:13] brother Matt well actually this morning
[1:27:15] I woke up and I had a headache had to go
[1:27:18] up to the store get me some Tylenol but
[1:27:20] brother Matt you got the Holy Ghost you
[1:27:21] mean it didn't change you no it didn't
[1:27:23] change me
[1:27:24] yet I'm being
[1:27:28] changed you say brother man how can you
[1:27:30] reconcile the two the Holy Ghost changes
[1:27:33] everything but when you're born of the
[1:27:35] spirit it doesn't
[1:27:37] change everything all right one day it's
[1:27:41] going to friends one day we'll receive
[1:27:44] the fullness of our inheritance of the
[1:27:47] adoption will be what to Wi the
[1:27:49] Redemption of this body but why while
[1:27:52] I'm
[1:27:53] here I've got a memory I've got
[1:27:56] conscience I've got imagination I've got
[1:27:59] affection I've got a human flesh that
[1:28:01] still gets tripped up I can still
[1:28:03] backslide you can still backslide in
[1:28:06] fact brother brandham said only a
[1:28:08] Christian can
[1:28:09] backslide you can still sin in fact
[1:28:11] brother Ram said only a Christian
[1:28:15] sins so then what is it brother Matt
[1:28:18] what is it is that it's important and
[1:28:21] vital you must be
[1:28:25] being
[1:28:28] changed I'm preaching to you a title
[1:28:31] being
[1:28:33] changed it is absolutely essential I
[1:28:37] know my thought's very simple but I'm
[1:28:38] just going to emphasize it here it is
[1:28:41] absolutely essential as a believer that
[1:28:44] you are continually being changed let me
[1:28:49] say it this way you cannot stop I don't
[1:28:51] care how good your experience was last
[1:28:53] month at Camp how good it was is going
[1:28:55] to be next month at Camp there's a
[1:28:57] battle still raging inside of you and
[1:28:59] you've got to say Lord I'm here again I
[1:29:02] need more of you God I need more of your
[1:29:04] life I need more of your spirit I need
[1:29:07] more of your
[1:29:08] word you can't stop you can't settle
[1:29:11] you've got to keep moving
[1:29:16] forward brother random says what
[1:29:18] happened this grain this this Branch
[1:29:21] fell over
[1:29:22] over and now a life that was going to
[1:29:26] grow up straight now because something
[1:29:29] that it didn't ask for had fallen upon
[1:29:33] it but do you know what the miracle
[1:29:37] is it was still alive amen that's right
[1:29:41] I said the miracle was that it was still
[1:29:45] alive through everything the devil has
[1:29:48] thrown at you in your life you ought to
[1:29:51] raise a hand and say God the miracle is
[1:29:55] I'm still here thank you Lord Satan you
[1:29:58] might have thrown everything you had at
[1:30:00] me but I want you to know tonight I
[1:30:03] still am here and I'm still going to
[1:30:05] fight I'm still going to press I'm still
[1:30:08] going to believe I'm still going to have
[1:30:11] faith you might have thrown the whole
[1:30:13] entire kitchen seek at me sa but I want
[1:30:15] to let you know I'm still a Believer I
[1:30:17] still got faith inside of my heart I'm
[1:30:19] still pressing the battle
[1:30:24] in spite of everything the devil threw
[1:30:26] my way the miracle is I'm still alive
[1:30:30] I've got a desire to serve the Lord I
[1:30:32] might not be perfect but I still say God
[1:30:35] I still want to be like you I want to be
[1:30:37] in your image Lord I might have got a
[1:30:39] lot of
[1:30:40] mistakes but there's still a desire
[1:30:43] inside of my
[1:30:46] heart to be
[1:30:49] changed brother bandam says notice this
[1:30:52] here sometimes we find people going
[1:30:54] through the prayer lines across the
[1:30:55] nation they just run up and think that
[1:30:57] the Lord ought to heal them right then
[1:30:59] but then notice there's something maybe
[1:31:02] down in there and we set before the Lord
[1:31:05] until he reveals he reveals that what it
[1:31:07] is there's something notice this there's
[1:31:10] a
[1:31:12] reason for everything
[1:31:15] wow I want you to understand young
[1:31:17] people there's a reason you are the way
[1:31:21] that you are
[1:31:23] in fact everything that you are brother
[1:31:25] Brandon would say there's a reason for
[1:31:28] everything and you've got to find the
[1:31:31] reason first and then you could find
[1:31:34] what to work on I found someone listen
[1:31:37] not excuse me in the interviews this
[1:31:39] morning I guess a person notice this
[1:31:41] here he says I I guess the person is
[1:31:44] still here in the building about
[1:31:45] speaking with tongues the person is a
[1:31:48] genuine person a real person and they've
[1:31:51] lived right and they've heard me say the
[1:31:53] evidence of the Holy Ghost wasn't
[1:31:55] speaking in tongues and it isn't but I
[1:31:58] advise that person to ask God to let
[1:32:02] them either speak in tongues or
[1:32:05] prophesy because it's the
[1:32:10] nature ah you mean that a person can
[1:32:13] have a nature inside of them in so much
[1:32:16] that brother Brandon would say that I
[1:32:18] advise them to the to ask ask the Lord
[1:32:22] to let them speak in tongues let's go a
[1:32:24] little bit further he says the first
[1:32:26] thing I went to that person and found
[1:32:28] their
[1:32:30] birthplace and what sign they were born
[1:32:33] under and could tell what their birth
[1:32:37] was which way it set them in their
[1:32:40] natural nature sets them in a certain
[1:32:45] line you mean your birthplace has
[1:32:48] something to do with how you're made up
[1:32:51] absolutely
[1:32:52] yep you mean the home that you grew up
[1:32:55] in the house that you were raised in the
[1:32:58] kind of parents that you had the kind of
[1:33:01] father the kind of mother breeds into
[1:33:04] you the kind of nature that they had and
[1:33:06] so brother Randon makes it very simple
[1:33:08] he says then when they're born again
[1:33:09] they're over here in another nature and
[1:33:11] then when you find into this nature
[1:33:12] that's the inside and the inside
[1:33:14] conscience brother bam says it's been
[1:33:16] one of the most amazing things I I've
[1:33:18] noticed along the lines of Ministry for
[1:33:19] our Lord Jesus it's the peculiar ity of
[1:33:22] people and the study of human life is
[1:33:24] one of the greatest things that a person
[1:33:25] can study to watch nature of people and
[1:33:30] the different parts of the Nations and
[1:33:32] worlds to where you go you'll notice
[1:33:35] there's a different attitude that people
[1:33:38] take toward Christ towards his service
[1:33:41] and towards his servants towards
[1:33:45] worship oh no brother bandham we're all
[1:33:48] the
[1:33:50] same everybody every body's the same
[1:33:53] well is that what brother bandam said
[1:33:55] come on somebody young
[1:33:57] people no we're all the same we all got
[1:33:59] to look the same we all got to act the
[1:34:00] same we all got to do the same things no
[1:34:02] because God said brother bandam said
[1:34:04] God's a god of variety and he makes
[1:34:06] everybody
[1:34:08] different and that's
[1:34:11] okay I'm not like you and you're not
[1:34:13] like
[1:34:14] me and I don't want to be you and you
[1:34:18] don't want to be
[1:34:19] me I'll say it the way brother Bram said
[1:34:22] it be who God made you to
[1:34:24] be you don't have to be anybody else
[1:34:28] other than who God made you to be and
[1:34:31] we're all different come on can I get an
[1:34:33] amen here tonight we're all different
[1:34:36] God's a god of variety he didn't make us
[1:34:38] all the same in fact our churches aren't
[1:34:40] all the same not all preachers are the
[1:34:41] same I wish I could be Donnie Reagan I
[1:34:43] promise but I'm
[1:34:45] not you say brother Matt then what are
[1:34:47] you going to do I got to be brother Matt
[1:34:50] that's right and brother Don's got try
[1:34:51] to be brother Donnie and if I try to go
[1:34:54] being brother Donnie brother bam said
[1:34:55] this way the wheels will fall off I
[1:34:57] guarantee you they
[1:34:59] would so you say brother manthan who do
[1:35:01] you got to be you got to be who God made
[1:35:03] you to be because God made you a
[1:35:06] particular way for a particular purpose
[1:35:09] for a particular life because you'll
[1:35:12] contact people I can't contact you'll
[1:35:14] reach people that I can't contact my
[1:35:16] experience will be totally different
[1:35:18] than
[1:35:19] yours but you've got to be who God God
[1:35:21] made you to
[1:35:23] be brother R says I've noticed the
[1:35:25] peculiarity people receive it
[1:35:27] differently he says he says and one
[1:35:29] thing it's been one type of meeting will
[1:35:31] just be wonderful in one part of the
[1:35:33] country where it won't work I love his
[1:35:35] honesty in the other part of the country
[1:35:38] so notice this here it was a peculiarity
[1:35:41] something that was different about
[1:35:43] everybody now listen friends I'm
[1:35:44] preaching to you here tonight I'm being
[1:35:46] changed because in inside of you is a
[1:35:49] memory a conscience imagin ation
[1:35:53] affection and you have the ability
[1:35:56] within the channels of your spirit to
[1:35:59] ingest
[1:36:01] things let me say this Co killed a lot
[1:36:04] of people you may have be here tonight
[1:36:06] and may say Co didn't even affect me
[1:36:08] didn't even hurt me man I barely got
[1:36:10] sick I got a flu that was worse than
[1:36:12] that I'm going to tell you it killed a
[1:36:13] lot of people and there's some people
[1:36:15] that it never even affected but I tell
[1:36:17] you what affected most everybody is
[1:36:19] actually the spirit of fear that people
[1:36:21] ingested from covid did more damage for
[1:36:24] a lot of people than the actual disease
[1:36:27] itself you say what is that because
[1:36:30] people can ingest
[1:36:32] fear and you have the ability to ingest
[1:36:35] things inside of your spirit that
[1:36:38] prevent you or hinder you in your walk
[1:36:41] with the Lord Jesus sir you can ingest a
[1:36:44] complex and not even realize
[1:36:47] it you can ingest a fear and not even
[1:36:50] realize that you have a fear over
[1:36:51] something and that fear has so great
[1:36:54] made a stronghold in your life listen
[1:36:56] friends we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:36:58] blood but against principalities and
[1:37:00] powers and wickedness in high places
[1:37:03] what is that that's other
[1:37:05] atmospheres and I want to tell you here
[1:37:07] tonight that there's a spirit in this
[1:37:09] world that you don't want to ingest
[1:37:12] inside of your spirit it's a spirit of
[1:37:14] hatred and Malice and jealousy and envy
[1:37:17] and
[1:37:20] destruction that's the only way that you
[1:37:22] can make sense to what's happened in our
[1:37:24] world today how could a world turn their
[1:37:26] back so much against a little bitty
[1:37:29] Nation small minuscule nation of Israel
[1:37:33] you say how could it how could it happen
[1:37:35] brother Matt I'll tell you how because a
[1:37:37] six seal Spirit pre-tribulation s Spirit
[1:37:41] from the six Seal have people have
[1:37:44] literally ingested a destruction Spirit
[1:37:47] upon them and they don't even realize it
[1:37:50] that's right that's the truth and
[1:37:52] there's hatred and there's malice and
[1:37:55] there's jealousy and there's
[1:37:57] envy and there's fighting and toxicity
[1:38:00] amongst people and divisions and
[1:38:04] divides and this group over here with
[1:38:06] that group over here and this click over
[1:38:08] here and this click over here friends it
[1:38:10] ought to not be in the family of God it
[1:38:12] ought to not be in the body of Christ it
[1:38:14] ought to not be we have clicks and and
[1:38:16] groups and groupies over here what
[1:38:19] happened to The Sovereign body or we're
[1:38:21] all brothers and we're all sisters and
[1:38:23] we're all fighting for each
[1:38:24] [Applause]
[1:38:27] other you need each other more now than
[1:38:30] you've ever needed each other
[1:38:34] before it's a spirit of destruction
[1:38:37] brother B I just hearing him say that
[1:38:39] before God could destroy the world
[1:38:42] people would have to get into the spirit
[1:38:44] of destruction
[1:38:46] first and so it's a spirit that comes to
[1:38:49] to bind you to afflict you as we
[1:38:52] preached on last night and you can have
[1:38:55] a chain upon your life and not even
[1:38:58] realize serving God I serve the Lord I
[1:39:01] love the Lord I'm born of the spirit of
[1:39:03] God I've got the baptism of the Holy
[1:39:05] Ghost and not realize that in your
[1:39:08] memory and your conscience and your
[1:39:10] reasoning and your affection there's a
[1:39:12] dark shadow or a dark spirit that hangs
[1:39:15] over you because you've ingested
[1:39:18] something that you need to clean out
[1:39:20] tonight
[1:39:22] prophet of God would say that's what's
[1:39:23] wrong with so many blowed up Christians
[1:39:26] they don't clean out the channels memory
[1:39:30] conscience reasoning imagination
[1:39:32] affection they don't clean out the
[1:39:34] channels and they go years and years and
[1:39:36] years get married have a wife have a
[1:39:39] husband young couple gets married the
[1:39:42] problem is is that inside of his
[1:39:43] channels he's ingested a complex from
[1:39:46] his father and then he takes that
[1:39:48] complex into marriage and then it exact
[1:39:51] masturbates and gets worse and then for
[1:39:52] 10 years 15 years maybe and then if he
[1:39:55] never cleans that out pressure will
[1:39:57] start to build and pressure will start
[1:39:59] to build because we live in a
[1:40:00] pressurized world and then before you
[1:40:03] know it
[1:40:04] suddenly
[1:40:06] poof and you say what happened how did
[1:40:09] that person end up that
[1:40:11] way they're a blowed up
[1:40:18] Christian they've taken something inside
[1:40:20] of their spirit and they don't even
[1:40:23] realize it much like this Daughter of

[1:44:54] through no one sees the bondage that I

[1:52:56] else had so bound this sister and she
[1:52:59] had a black sheep following
[1:53:02] her and it was a lie that she had
[1:53:04] ingested you say brother Matt what was
[1:53:06] it you know what I love so much about
[1:53:07] this quote is brother random didn't
[1:53:09] perform any kind of magic he didn't
[1:53:11] speak some kind of spell over her all he
[1:53:13] did was identify a demon Spirit of a lie
[1:53:17] and she was free of it you say brother
[1:53:19] Matt what do I need to get free let the
[1:53:21] Holy Ghost say God Shine Your Light down
[1:53:24] inside of my soul and expose the devil's
[1:53:28] lies in my
[1:53:32] life you're not a
[1:53:34] [Applause]
[1:53:37] witch and strangely I went to a place
[1:53:40] where I made an odd turn instead of
[1:53:42] turning there I went up to make a turn
[1:53:43] the lights flashed on a lovely couple
[1:53:45] outside two fine young ladies that I had
[1:53:48] just married to fine young ministers
[1:53:51] Satan after he seen the minister one of
[1:53:53] them in his ministry begin to be he says
[1:53:55] being said and he took a life's
[1:53:56] companion right there at this altar they
[1:53:58] went away happily on their honeymoon and
[1:54:01] the enemy jumped in on jumped on to this
[1:54:05] young man and I'm saying this to express
[1:54:08] what I'm saying does he
[1:54:13] care somehow with faith that would not
[1:54:16] take no they turned and returned back
[1:54:19] here knowing after they was all the way
[1:54:22] over way in the East here somewhere on
[1:54:24] their honeymoon returned back and was
[1:54:26] sitting waiting and I walked in fine
[1:54:29] handsome young man his wife sitting on
[1:54:31] the outside crying her and their little
[1:54:33] companion the other man the other
[1:54:35] brother come running which is a friend
[1:54:37] of this young man saying oh brother
[1:54:38] brandham such and such a thing has
[1:54:40] happened went there and seen this
[1:54:41] handsome young man sitting there just in
[1:54:44] the peak of his life a leader of young
[1:54:46] men sitting there and Satan had bound
[1:54:52] him he never noticed but I took my hand
[1:54:56] left to shake with his right to see if
[1:54:59] some disease had plagued him but there
[1:55:00] was no sign of f sign of vibration
[1:55:03] coming right out of the room from
[1:55:05] praying and fasting and waiting upon the
[1:55:06] Lord the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:55:08] was there and that's why it led us and
[1:55:11] then seeing this Shadow Of
[1:55:15] Darkness over him I never said what I
[1:55:18] was doing but in the less than a couple
[1:55:20] moments
[1:55:21] time it was all
[1:55:24] gone the coldness of his hand had left
[1:55:28] he was shouting and praising God a few
[1:55:31] minutes to find
[1:55:35] himself a few minutes to find himself
[1:55:39] and here they sat this morning sitting
[1:55:41] in the audience see how Satan was trying
[1:55:44] to upset that young man by referring to
[1:55:47] him of some
[1:55:48] complex
[1:55:51] you mean brother brandham he was bound
[1:55:53] you didn't lead him to an altar and tell
[1:55:55] him he need to be born again no no
[1:55:58] that's not what he needs that might be
[1:55:59] what you need here tonight but that
[1:56:00] might not be what you
[1:56:03] need you mean brother bandam you didn't
[1:56:05] just have him repent over it no no
[1:56:07] actually what brother bham did is he
[1:56:09] started going back into his
[1:56:11] life and he started W Discerning this in
[1:56:14] his life and he looked all the way back
[1:56:16] now it doesn't tell us what he does but
[1:56:18] he tells us this he says Satan was
[1:56:21] trying to refer to him of some complex
[1:56:24] to be built
[1:56:25] back you mean the devil will try to
[1:56:28] rebuild something that God has delivered
[1:56:31] you from oh yeah he'll try to rebuild
[1:56:34] Jericho after the walls have already
[1:56:36] fallen I got a news for the devil

[1:56:40] anything God has broken down in my life
[1:56:44] I'm not going to allow a complex a fear
[1:56:46] if God has Set Me Free Satan you don't
[1:56:51] have any place in my
[1:56:53] heart and I seen it by a vision of the
[1:56:57] Lord but God cared for that man God
[1:57:03] cared for that young
[1:57:08] boy imagine clutching bound like this
[1:57:13] Daughter of Zion by a black cloud just
[1:57:16] coming in a few moments ago a lady I
[1:57:18] seen her sitting here in the with no
[1:57:20] just got a seat some way and sat down

[1:57:25] to get a hold of you and she said I'm so
[1:57:30] desperate oh I read these words this
[1:57:34] afternoon and I wonder if there'd be a
[1:57:36] young person here tonight that could
[1:57:38] resonate with this woman I'm so
[1:57:42] desperate brother brandom I'm so
[1:57:46] desperate nine years I've tried to get a
[1:57:48] hold of you I'm here late and couldn't
[1:57:51] even get a prayer card to be in the line
[1:57:54] the lady moved back she said brother
[1:57:55] brandom just a word with you standing
[1:57:58] there a vision broke over this fine
[1:58:00] looking young woman see that her heart
[1:58:02] was
[1:58:03] burdened and she was trying to work to
[1:58:06] make a living and a great thing happened
[1:58:12] way back in the time of her parents wow
[1:58:17] you mean something that had nothing yeah
[1:58:20] to do with
[1:58:21] her something way back in the time of
[1:58:24] her parents that had caused this great
[1:58:27] thing to happen to her and the Lord
[1:58:30] Jesus revealed it and showed what it was
[1:58:32] and there in a moment's time took it
[1:58:35] from the woman wow she went around
[1:58:38] rejoicing and now sitting here in the
[1:58:40] audience friends I want you to notice
[1:58:41] something she had lived with this Dark
[1:58:44] Cloud for 9 years but one moment under
[1:58:48] the presence of the Lord changed
[1:58:50] everything in her life I say tonight you
[1:58:53] might have struggled for the last two
[1:58:55] years in your life but one moment with
[1:58:58] one word of God you say what brother mat
[1:59:00] for the Holy Ghost to expose the devil
[1:59:03] in your life I say exposing Holy Ghost
[1:59:06] expose the devil in my
[1:59:09] life she was
[1:59:12] free you say brother mat but she was
[1:59:14] free by the Holy Ghost she was born of
[1:59:16] the spirit of right that's right but you
[1:59:18] see you can be raised up to life again
[1:59:21] like Lazarus was but still Bound By Your
[1:59:25] Grave
[1:59:26] clothes brother Ram says she went around
[1:59:29] rejoicing and now sitting here in the
[1:59:31] audience with us rejoicing with tears as
[1:59:33] she's wiping her eyes now knowing that
[1:59:37] the truth of the thing was made known
[1:59:39] and what that little poor neurotic woman
[1:59:42] that was so nervous and she didn't know
[1:59:44] what to do with herself thinking that
[1:59:46] she was gone and there was no Holy
[1:59:50] Spirit and this is her last
[1:59:53] day she had tried for n years and she
[1:59:57] was about at the end of Despair God
[2:00:01] cared for that little woman who know one
[2:00:05] cares for what a time he does care when
[2:00:11] he was here on Earth I say he cared for
[2:00:13] the people so much till he healed their
[2:00:15] sick comforted their hearts told them a
[2:00:17] place that where he would go and prepare
[2:00:19] for them he would come again to receive
[2:00:20] them unto himself he cared for them and
[2:00:22] notice he cared so much until he knowed
[2:00:25] when he must leave in order to bring
[2:00:26] this great thing to us he said I'll not
[2:00:28] leave you comfortless but I will send
[2:00:30] the Holy Spirit and he shall continue my
[2:00:32] care for you until he returns there's no
[2:00:36] one cares like
[2:00:43] Jesus brother bam comes to this message
[2:00:45] and I'm going to close here give me just
[2:00:47] a few minutes can I have just a
[2:00:51] couple he comes to this boy and he's
[2:00:55] brother ROM deals with this young man
[2:00:58] and he's he's going to get married he's
[2:00:59] likes a girl brother V says he couldn't
[2:01:02] he he he he he he couldn't get over this
[2:01:04] whatever it was in his life this Grudge
[2:01:06] or the anger brother B doesn't actually
[2:01:07] tell us what it was but he says a few
[2:01:09] instance for instance a few days ago I
[2:01:11] was caught on a scene of a little
[2:01:13] something going on fine young man very
[2:01:15] fine boy he was going with a little girl
[2:01:18] very fine little girl out of a fine
[2:01:20] family and this boy all of a sudden came
[2:01:23] up with some kind of an idea and just
[2:01:25] walked away he did something wrong to
[2:01:28] the little girl as much had promised to
[2:01:30] do a certain thing and didn't do it
[2:01:31] didn't really know what it
[2:01:33] was and instead of coming to the girl
[2:01:36] and
[2:01:37] apologizing like a gentleman should
[2:01:41] do it just wasn't in him to do it and
[2:01:46] the father and mother called me to the
[2:01:47] scene and said we would desire to know
[2:01:48] what's wrong with with her boy now it's
[2:01:50] not easy to do sometimes but you must be
[2:01:51] truthful and be honest therefore the boy
[2:01:53] was a Christian as far as a Believer
[2:01:56] notice how he divides this he had
[2:01:58] repented and had been baptized and had a
[2:02:00] position among the Believers but yet had
[2:02:03] not received the baptism of the Holy
[2:02:05] Spirit no matter how much he thought he
[2:02:08] had and the father and mother notice you
[2:02:10] were you thinking let's read it you
[2:02:13] thinking you having it and having it is
[2:02:16] two different things you might be able
[2:02:19] to try to say you hav't and you might be
[2:02:21] able to show some evidence of some
[2:02:22] emotion but unless your life is
[2:02:26] vindicating what you're professing to
[2:02:28] have you still haven't got it no matter
[2:02:30] how many emotions how much you jump run
[2:02:32] Sensations speak in tongues or shouting
[2:02:34] whatever you might lay upon it which is
[2:02:36] all right I believe in all of that but
[2:02:38] unless your life copes with your
[2:02:42] testimony then you haven't got it cuz
[2:02:45] the fruit of the spirit I goes to the
[2:02:47] Fruit of the Spirit vind Ates what you
[2:02:49] are just like the fruit of any tree
[2:02:51] tells you what it is Jesus said by their
[2:02:53] fruit you shall know them now this young
[2:02:55] fellow's parents his mother's German no
[2:02:58] reflection on the German but there's a
[2:02:59] strain in that family that is they'll
[2:03:02] just
[2:03:03] sit I preach to a lot of people like
[2:03:06] this and you can talk to them they'll
[2:03:08] just stare at you right in the
[2:03:12] face they got this girl sister the
[2:03:14] mother this boy her sister I've come
[2:03:16] down on the street many a morning this
[2:03:18] young lady be sitting the yard I'd say
[2:03:19] good morning to you she'd just look at
[2:03:23] me I'd stop and I'd say sure a fine
[2:03:27] morning she'd
[2:03:30] stand look right at you an intelligent
[2:03:33] woman and I'd say come up to see us
[2:03:36] sometimes she'd just stand and look well
[2:03:38] her brothers are that way father and
[2:03:40] mother is that way now the father so he
[2:03:42] points to the mom now let's go to the
[2:03:43] dad now the father of the boy is
[2:03:45] strictly an Irishman Moody high-tempered
[2:03:48] High strung is brother bram's family
[2:03:50] that is that's his whole family's like
[2:03:52] that except one or the other out of the
[2:03:53] family converted now in this boy in in
[2:03:57] this boy inside of this
[2:04:01] boy this father and mother both
[2:04:03] Christians filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:04:04] they have brought this young man up the
[2:04:06] way of the Lord and now the young man is
[2:04:08] about 17 18 years old something along
[2:04:10] there veryify kid he's been a real model
[2:04:11] boy at home nice kid he's got a brother
[2:04:13] that's just vice versa but the girl the
[2:04:16] mother's family lives close to the Fine
[2:04:17] church but do you think they'd ever come
[2:04:19] over there no they just know it's right
[2:04:21] but it just it's not in them to ask
[2:04:25] forgiveness or ask
[2:04:28] pardoning then I guess brother Brandon
[2:04:30] that's okay he's all right just leave
[2:04:32] that there
[2:04:33] uh-uh they just won't do it it's not in
[2:04:37] them now the genes in this father and
[2:04:40] the mother of this boy no matter how
[2:04:44] much they are
[2:04:46] converted Still Remains the the flesh
[2:04:49] that's been inbred out to this boy
[2:04:51] therefore the boy has got a complex in
[2:04:54] him just like his mother's family and
[2:04:56] they are not forgiving they will not
[2:04:57] apologize and that's where the boy
[2:05:01] stands now I said to the father no
[2:05:04] matter how much you've raised him up
[2:05:05] said I look at you out of your look at
[2:05:07] you look at you out of your family all
[2:05:10] of them drunks fighting shooting cutting
[2:05:13] and so forth now look at your family to
[2:05:15] the mother there are a bunch of people
[2:05:17] just sit there won't speak
[2:05:19] very independent so forth they're
[2:05:21] reverent to religion but I said it's not
[2:05:25] you you're the only one out of all of
[2:05:28] your sisters and brothers and you're
[2:05:31] sweet kind
[2:05:33] forgiving what does
[2:05:37] that and your tree part of the family
[2:05:40] tree yet you have received the Holy
[2:05:43] Ghost that's the thing that made you
[2:05:46] tender and sweet it's not your your
[2:05:49] people
[2:05:51] anymore it's your Christ that lives
[2:05:54] inside of you I went said to the boy
[2:05:57] look at your family practice all of them
[2:05:58] are drunk so forth I said how Moody High
[2:06:00] tempered High strong strong but you're
[2:06:02] not you're kind forgiving what is it the
[2:06:06] Holy Spirit you're no more what you are
[2:06:12] it's Christ in
[2:06:15] you I said now that same thing has to
[2:06:19] happen to your son father raised up said
[2:06:22] my son went to the altar he was baptized
[2:06:24] correctly in the name of Jesus water
[2:06:26] Baptist The Bu said I know my son has
[2:06:28] come to Christ I said that may be all
[2:06:29] right the outward motions he might be
[2:06:32] identified as a Believer with the
[2:06:34] Believers but until he's regenerated
[2:06:37] born again I'd advise that man never
[2:06:41] that I'd advise that young man to never
[2:06:43] marry a woman he'll make hell on Earth
[2:06:47] for her her that's right until that
[2:06:51] gentle oh Lord sweet forgiving Spirit of
[2:06:57] Christ comes in I read these words and I
[2:07:00] raise up my hand and say let that gentle
[2:07:03] sweet loving forgiving kind Holy
[2:07:08] Spirit that'll be a paradox itself to
[2:07:12] take the very nature of a boy that's
[2:07:14] bred between father and mother and yet
[2:07:17] in his intellectuals he's trying his
[2:07:19] best to overcome it he can't do it he'll
[2:07:23] never overcome it Christ will have to
[2:07:26] overcome it when he lets Christ in then
[2:07:29] he's already overcome then amen it'll be
[2:07:33] a perfect Paradox when a man is
[2:07:36] born of the spirit of
[2:07:39] God could you bow your heads with me
[2:07:41] every head bowed every eye
[2:07:47] closed there's she laid musicians could
[2:07:50] you
[2:07:51] come laying in the dirt what are you
[2:07:55] doing
[2:07:56] there God didn't save you Daughter of
[2:08:00] Zion for you to lay there graveling
[2:08:05] enslaved in the
[2:08:07] dirt listen the message of God here
[2:08:10] tonight it's very
[2:08:12] simple it hasn't been rebuked it's not a
[2:08:15] rebuke it's not a it's not a
[2:08:17] chastisement it's a simple word from
[2:08:19] your heavenly father child awake
[2:08:24] awake put on your
[2:08:28] strength wake
[2:08:30] up you've got it down inside of you you
[2:08:34] say brother Matt what does this woman
[2:08:35] have to do what does the daughter of
[2:08:38] Zion have to do she must Shake
[2:08:42] herself she must cast off her chains you
[2:08:46] say brother Matt you mean no one's going
[2:08:48] to come
[2:08:48] and pick her up no no one's
[2:08:51] coming you mean no one's going to come
[2:08:53] and unlock that chain no friend you see
[2:08:57] the power of the of the chain the key
[2:09:01] was in her
[2:09:04] hands I said the power to unlock the
[2:09:07] bondage that she was
[2:09:09] under was already within
[2:09:13] her and God
[2:09:15] says wake up put on your
[2:09:20] strength put on your beautiful
[2:09:25] garments because if you
[2:09:28] don't you'll die
[2:09:31] there if you
[2:09:34] don't you'll perish there gring in the
[2:09:39] dirt but you don't have to
[2:09:41] child you don't have to stay there
[2:09:43] another minute in that addiction you
[2:09:46] don't have to stay there another second

[2:10:22] say Lord Jesus I want to be freed out of

[2:10:28] my my memory my conscience oh hands

[2:10:40] that the devil has put upon my life I

[2:13:02] nothing that there's no great thing that
[2:13:04] they need to do other than just to

[2:22:16] God
[2:22:25] thank God thank you thank you for
[2:22:27] yielding to the Holy Ghost and I thank
[2:22:28] you so much for being with us this
[2:22:30] weekend now pray for the service
[2:22:32] tomorrow for the because you've had a
[2:22:34] start now through this weekend that we
[2:22:35] look to continue to the service tomorrow
[2:22:38] but in hearing that there's I thank God
[2:22:40] for the message there are so many things
[2:22:43] in the message to calm our anxiety and
[2:22:46] it's something and I when I was first
[2:22:48] when I first started becoming aware and
[2:22:50] I first started feeding and all the
[2:22:51] things of the message and trying to make
[2:22:53] sense of it my mind I felt would explode
[2:22:56] there's so much content and information
[2:22:59] and I had a brother and he shook my hand
[2:23:00] and he can tell I was troubled and he
[2:23:02] said Let It Drop into your heart and it
[2:23:05] was something I had learned and I was
[2:23:06] reading the message the token and
[2:23:08] Understanding God's Own Life coming into
[2:23:10] you and I was trying to figure it out
[2:23:12] with my
[2:23:13] mind but Let It Drop and then the he
[2:23:16] told me the message this was just
[2:23:17] someone in the parking lot one body of
[2:23:19] believer to another saying the message
[2:23:22] that he preached after was desperations
[2:23:24] and so my prayer for you is that you
[2:23:26] become desperate for what it is that you
[2:23:28] have heard that's if you get to that
[2:23:30] condition and you drop it down in your
[2:23:32] heart you don't have to understand it
[2:23:34] all but to be desperate to recognize
[2:23:36] God's presence and you become desperate
[2:23:39] that's when everything changed I pray a
[2:23:42] blessing upon you beyond belief we love
[2:23:44] you we support you we are here for you
[2:23:46] now let's let's pray for the food and

[2:23:57] the testimony of their lives I wish Lord
[2:24:01] that they become desperate desperate not
