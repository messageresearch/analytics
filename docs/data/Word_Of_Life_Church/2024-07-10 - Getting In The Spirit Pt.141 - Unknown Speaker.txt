praise the Lord for that amen I find it still amazing don't you yes sir amen thank you brother Jason it's beautiful isn't the Lord wonderful yes how may come to receive from him tonight amen well I believe if we come with the right attitude and we're able to open our hearts to the Lord I believe he'll absolutely minister to every one of our hearts I tell him all the time he's the only one that can custom fit a sermon that would be able to fit and satisfy and meet every need you imagine trying to do that with just these hundreds of people that are here what about the thousands that'll stream it only God can do that right he's that mindful of us too let's turn to U First Corinthians chapter 15: 47 also I'd like to um wish Emma and Ellie my granddaughters a happy 18th birthday today and I'd also like to wish my son-in-law Scotty a happy birthday he's older than 18 but younger than 75 amen if I forget this week I'm toast I mean I I am ruined we are surrounded by birthdays and an iers Aries and actually Carol's grandfather also was born um today he's been gone for many many years so it's quite a quite a busy time 1 Corinthians chap 15: 47 now we're longing for the land where there will be no more birthdays right amen because when the birth days stop the death days stop too amen see as long as we got a birth day we got a death day yeah but aren't you glad Jesus took care of that for us listen to these scriptures now that we're going to read tonight carefully the first man is of the earth earthy the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the Lord From Heaven so we're speaking then about Adam and Jesus as is the earthy such are they such are they also that are earthy and as is the Heavenly such are they also that are Heavenly and as we have borne the image of the earthy born I love this word that Paul chose to use where to Bear constantly of clothing or garments so listen what he says now with that in mind as we have borne the image of the Earthly or look this way so it's a garment so what is this body that we live in it's an old coat right and what does death do simply takes the coat away from you and gives you a new one so you're not dead if you're a child of God you just changed coats as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the Heavenly now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God but if you notice Paul does not say Flesh and Bones cuz Jesus said a spirit has not Flesh and Bones as you see me have you see in the new body we will have no blood right Jesus didn't have blood and his resurrected body now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither does corruption inherit incorruption praise the Lord how many hand would like to be remembered as we pray tonight over the word Heavenly Father these words have inspired so many of your children for over 2,000 years now since it was written we thank you for Apostle Peter Apostle James we thank you for Luke the great physician the great writer we thank you for John the Beloved Apostle disciple and also a prophet but oh how we thank you for Paul because he wrote Things That No One Else in the New Testament wrote I see why Satan wants to Blind the people of this age to convince them they do not need the gift and the Insight of a prophet because a prophet has the ability to break into the word and see and understand things that no other office in the fivefold ministry does I pray that you'd speak to us tonight father teach us from your word Lord God you saw these needs dear Jesus we're asking that you'd be mindful I know Lord there's still some that are traveling even today coming back from vacation some traveling some going pray that you'd watch over the people fathers are out on the highways and flying and so on that youd bring them back home safely to us till we can all be ready for that great big vacation that we're all planning on bless the service tonight we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated so Boaz takes Ruth and she becomes his wife and he comes in unto her and leads her to a body change so she seemed as if though she was dead she had no children which was a great reproach for a woman no child unlike today in the day that we're living so it wasn't come to find out it was not actually her it was the man she was with so there's nothing wrong with Ruth as far as being fertile but it was the union or the man that she was joined up with that could give her no child so with us that we had to have a death which would loose us from our first Union and then put us with the right man and we will bring forth a Christ child amen whenever we look at the parallel between the Book of Ruth and the many types and shadows that the Lord had in his mind of a gentile bride of how she would come into fruition and she would bring forth His Image only the Old Testament could make a mirror or a shadow or a type but it could not bring forth the real thing even in Solomon he was able to bring forth a type of the son of David a type of the Millennium but he could not bring forth the real millenum so and the different ones of Joshua and joshc and the different ones in the Old Testament habac and Nehemiah and they were able to pick up Jeremiah whenever he bought his cousin's property and he had Hann anel and he was able to seal up the document prophesying that there would be a breach and that there would also be a loosening of the seal and people would once again on property in Judah in Jerusalem and in Galilee all of those things were types and shadows but we know the shadow can be very vague you can't see it but my hand is making a shadow on this desk now the reason of it is of course is because the light is above me and the light cannot penet at and go through my hand because my hand is not translucent or transparent so as I move this finger the shadow moves on the desk I move this one that one I move my hand back and forth you can't sit but you take my word for it but it's still very very vague so all it is is just a dark image I can see my thumb I'm touching my thumb my first finger I can put my fingers like that and I can see it vaguely through the image and through the shadow there but I have no clue what color my skin is I don't know if I'm a white man if I'm an Asian or if I'm a Caucasian if I would be an africanamerican I can't really tell because it is a shadow so a shadow can be very very vade so once the shadow becomes the positive now what what happens as I lay my hand right down on top of the desk you know what just happened the Shadow on this desk disappeared so as I look down on this desk I no longer see the shadow I can tell you exactly a right there where the fox bit me whenever I was 11 years old the scar is still there the Stitch marks are still on my hand starts right here and runs all the way down to the bottom that was not visible in the shadow I see I've got these brown marks right here they tell me it's old age marks wow what in the world am I doing with them I've got hairs up here on my hands I've got different different thing scars and scratches got a big scar right here where I was trimming some Vines one day and laid my arm wide open about that long so it's amazing though the Shadows didn't reflect all that so whenever people look at the Old Testament and someone had made a complaint about me not long ago and said that guy's really really weird because he preaches from the Old Testament and the Old Testament don't he know that the Old Testament is already full feel so I told the person that told me that I said the next time you talk to that individual you tell them that there are prophecies in Zachariah in Malachi in Hagi even in Deuteronomy and Isaiah and habac which have not yet been fulfilled so there are things in the Old Testament that as of yet have not been fulfilled and so are their types and shadows that are still being fulfilled by a gentile bride today from the Old Testament so what we can see then is in the shadows many of those things were pretty vague but whenever the Shadows become more positive then it starts reflecting greater and greater as far as what the Lord wanted to do now read with me if you would in the Book of Luke 20:34 in the resurrection you can see why the Sadducees and the Pharisees had this debate now the Sadducees did not believe in a resurrection the Pharisees did but the Sadducees did not believe in a resurrection nor in angels nor in spirits no wonder they were sad you see uh I found out a few years ago there's some folks in the message that don't believe in a resurrection either they don't believe in the coming of the Lord as a matter of fact they believe the Lord come in 1963 I do too but I'm still looking for a Corporal coming that's right but I want you to notice now in the shadow of how that Ruth was raised in her position she was raised from a dead moabitas and also her womb would have been considered unfruitful she was also raised from that image that she brought forth uh a reflection of who Boaz really was and also Naomi was also raised from the dead considered that she would have been pass childbearing and she was but her daughter in the gospel of which she mothered in the types brought forth a son and she took that son to her bosom and officially legally adopted that son and then it was said about Naomi that this son became her Kinsman now not Boaz but this son and she became a nurse now she could not of course have have fed this child cuz she was too old but she took care of him and there was something about this child that renewed Naomi's use so he raised her also from the dead in a figurative form now the resurrection also includes the Gentile bride now for those of you T not that are in this place and those of you that are streaming that have received the token life you have spiritually already raised from the dead you were in dark denominationalism but you have raised from the dead because the son Christ Jesus has waved over your soul and you have passed from Death unto life now we know then that this token life that has been applied to our soul has regenerated us look at the word regenerate or regeneration look how it's spelled are e g e n e r a t e or r a t i o n re Gene arate regene aration so it is a reging or the quickening of the real Gene of who you are then what happened you raised from the dead so what are we waiting on then the prophet asked the question how can a person that this has happened to ever get sick again how could they ever die how could they ever go through tremendous battles and trials and of course the answer is that we have received the down payment or the earnest of our inheritance and we're waiting for the full payment inside of our body which has not yet been fully redeemed but ammy believes we're on our way now what's Jesus speak speaking about the resurrection now there was a debate among about the scribes and the Pharisees and they gave him this foolish Parable and Jesus is going to answer this Parable Luke 20:34 Jesus answering said unto them the children of this world marry and are given in marriage but they which shall be listen to these words they which shall be accounted Worthy to obtain the world that world and the resurrection from the dead neither marry oh my nor are given in marriage now I want you to notice this is the master of the Resurrection why would he couple these two words together and Associate it with the resurrection but they would shall be accounted worthy accounted worthy so each of us then have an account a Heavenly account and the only ones going in the resurrection and the Rapture are those that haven't been attributed to their account and on their account statement it will say worthy now for those who believe and are Christians and are saved and on their account will be this word written forgiven saved but the word Worthy on will be wanting now as I mentioned to you the other day all preachers are not men of God some preachers are just preachers they're just professional preachers like professional bankers and Woodworkers and whatever more so all preachers are not men of God all Christians are not Saints what is a saint a Sanctified one so Carol and I as of this week have been married for 51 years so I Sanctified myself unto her she Sanctified herself unto me and we have remained in that state for 51 years now so you'll understand understand it I pledge to her I would want no other woman in my life and she would want no other man in her life so she Sanctified herself from all other men I Sanctified myself from all other women wil thou love her honor her keep thee only unto her so long as you both shall live I do so I Sanctified myself unto her she Sanctified herself unto me and by the grace of God we have kept that Covenant promise to each other for 51 years so we're able to stand before you tonight as our church and say that we have been loyal we have been faithful to each other is that worth something I think it is I think it's notable I think it's outstanding by the grace of God and there some in here tonight could say it with even years longer than Carolyn I have I think it's a notable thing God bless you for doing that because in the age we're living you can't already find people that's Mar married that long anymore and yet you realize even Christians that some Christians have had not been faithful to their husband or their wife and they feel awful about it and then they feel terrible and they bear the reproach of it and it it's a terrible thing that they did but I want you to notice that one this is one thing that separates the bride from the church in that the church is saved but the church has other lovers in her love life so she loves sports more than God she loves activities she loves all kinds of things more than going to church on Wednesday night and it's sad to say on Sunday morning for some people so they love this and brother bam talked about it whenever he was here that people would stay home on Wednesday night and watch we love Susi that's what he called Lucy he might have been closer to the truth than what her mom and daddy called her we love Susi and he said if God is in your heart you can't wait for them Church doors to open well come on Saints so you realize that a lot of people that claim they are Christians and are saved and I'm not saying that they're not but I'm saying this only those who are accounted wory will go on the resurrection amen and the Rapture they will be set apart to the Lord Jesus for his will now notice this is the man himself saying this but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world oh I'm so glad there's another world and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage look again Luke 21: 36 now don't raise your hands but I wonder how many of you pray this scripture right here because the Lord Jesus Jesus told you to watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man isn't it amazing he didn't say son of God or son of David wonder why would use the title son of man and relate standing before the son of man in a dispensation when the Great Escape will take place now notice the words of the Lord Jesus watch ye therefore and pray always again I'm not going to ask you to raise your hands but how many of you believe Believers sting here tonight pray always that you will be accounted worthy to escape all these things that's going to come to pass well if you don't you've just been added a new thing to pray for from tonight on watch ye therefore now watch now these are people this is the mindset this is the attitude of those going in the Rapture this is one of the requirements of the Bride the Lord Jesus said watch ye therefore all right now watch it's like this groom has a list by which he declares this is what I want my wife to be this is my Divine list so he predeter determined this list before he ever made a man he predetermined this list before he ever made a star and then before his list could ever come into existence man fell but God still kept the list so then everyone that was born thereafter was born without the ability to keep the list and then God knowing that man would do that he for ordained a people that would actually have the nature of the list inbred in their genos in their seed so if God wants it there's only one way for a people to ever meet the list so if every one of these terms has to met in order to be bride and that's the only way you're going so then he you so boy he's a pretty picky guy well he is he's very picky I'll tell you one thing you Brothers here tonight that's not married and you would just marry any woman I say shame on you you Brothers ought to be picky you young ladies ought to be picky over the man that you marry you ought to have a standard that you set let me tell you one thing ought to be your standard if that boy or that man that you're thinking about married ain't got the Holy Ghost I would not say I do or I will until he does it because he'll never be able to lead you the right way without the Holy Ghost amen well praise the Lord now you imagine the only way that God can ever do this is to write the list in the hearts of his children so when they come to the Earth and that predestinated seed Falls inside of them the contents of the list they don't even know there is a list they don't even know that there's a seed they know nothing about it but it's like whenever they hear it preached and something new we say is brought to them and they didn't even know it like some of you I saw it on your faces whenever I read it to you it clicked on some of your hearts some of you never knew and did you never known that the Lord Jesus said for you to pray it that way but I know by the look on some of your faces from this night on it will be taken care of you know why because the light on that promise quickened and aligned with the list inside of your own soul so then the connection him wanting the list to be kept I want this this this this this and a woman I want a clean woman I want a Sanctified woman I want a holy ghost filled woman I want a woman that will say Amen to my word I want a woman to live right and the more you go down that list the more you realize so many of the church people in this age cannot meet the requirements on the list and may I say you and I tonight could not make it either were it not for the grace of God we would fall short at the very best and no matter how much we desired it to be now watch Jesus said watch ye therefore and pray not just when you get saved but pray always this was one of my favorite scriptures when I was in Pentecost I never knew why because the church I went to they never even taught a Rapture my uncle har and them they never even believed in a Rapture so I wasn't taught a Rapture and I never understood till years later why did this scripture so ReSound in my soul but after I come to the message of the hour I realize it was part of the list that was manifesting itself in me even back C aren't you glad pray you therefore always that you may be accounted worthy now notice accounted worthy to escape notice the words now that he uses so the Great Escape is right on us look at the word that he go to use Escape so what what are we escaping from Leota blindness Darkness all types of sin all types of wickedness all types of religiosity all types of unbelief look friend the Rapture is an escape so if you were in a jail or you were in a house or you were put up somewhere don't you see why the Lord Jesus used this word pray you therefore always that you may may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and stand before the son of man so it is an escape well in order to escape we've got to know the way out do we not so if you were in a prison you were in a jail you were in a building and the building caught on fire you're staying at a hotel I've stayed in hotels around the world you know one thing that I always want to do I want to find when I go in that room no matter what Flor they put me on I like to be the higher the better cuz I'm a light sleeper and it seemed like I get under the room if I get in the fifth floor and there's sixth floor I don't know how in the world but there's elephants that wind up in them room above me I don't care where I'm at I don't see how in the world they know exactly where I'm going they're up all night romping and jumping and carrying on and you know what one thing I do though I want to look which way is the exit y'all ever did that when you say at a hotel I want to know where the exit is now I've never had to leave because of a fire and I hope I don't ever do it but the way I look at is just a little bit of not you know having a little common sense and a little bit of insurance in case that thing goes off I don't know exactly where the exit that's exactly what's wrong with a lot of churches they don't know where the exit is I don't know how the how do I get out of here how do I get get out of ler see and know what the preachers tell them the preachers are given them false directions oh you don't have to live holy you don't have to dress right oh my goodness you know yet that you don't have to do all that stuff you know what they're doing they're giving them the wrong directions and they're going to wake up in the tribulation period and the exit door has already been shut and the Escape has reached the climax and they find themselves in the middle of the tribulation period we would not have realized the Escape roote ourself had not God by his grace opened our understanding and showed us the way out aren't you glad you know the way out notice that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and stand before the son of man look at the Lord Jesus now again in Revelation 3:4 when we're talking about the Sardis Church age thou Hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy notice this word how it keeps coming up over and over again worthy worthy so they have some worse about them and this worse is what puts them in the position where they are and it's the worst so where did they get this word they were born like everybody else lost without God so the only way to get worse then would be have to be given to us attributed to us from someone else who had the worst and then this wor by his righteousness of course it will begin to act out then when we get his righteousness we will start obeying what he says so we get this worse and then he says all right you're my bride you're my people I give you my righteousness and then he turns right around now and tells us in Luke 21:36 pray you therefore always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things so you see it's not just to give from him and then the rest of the time we s around and twiddle our PMS we don't pray we don't read our Bible we don't go to church we don't have to live right oh no if we have a worthy life it will reflect itself by the way we live and the church said amen notice these Saints now and Sardis I I love this that the way the Lord Jesus say this thou Hast a few names in Sardis isn't it amazing it didn't say you have a few people he didn't say you have a few people you've got a few church members but you've got a few names you've got a few names you've got a few names in Sardis which have not defiled their garments oh my so a name isn't a association with a behavior so you've got a few names in Sardis which have not defile their garments and they shall walk with me now here is the worthy one they shall walk with me in white for they they are worthy this is the only worthy one that could be I'm the only worthy one is turning back to people on the Earth and saying you all are worthy how could they be how in the world could they ever be worthy they shared of his righteousness in other words they found the identified word for the age they lived in and they were partakers of his list so his list of requirements for the arest age they met it and by meeting what was on the list for that age into their account was this Oh Glory was this title under their names that they were worthy now they wasn't just saved saved is not necessarily being worthy but they were worthy so they hadn't just got saved they moved on into a worthy state with him so it was only those that were worthy that would walk with him in white wonder what happened to the rest of them so there was other people there in Sardis that were saved but there was only a few names That'll Walk with him and white can't you see again the separation between the bride and the church notice again in Luke 20:36 now Jesus we'll go back to what he's talking about the resurrection neither can they die anymore for they are equal unto the angels and they are the children of God being the children of the Resurrection so as Jesus Christ was declared to be the Son of God by his resurrection from the dead so sons of men which are born by natural birth also have the declared title given to them that they are Children of the Resurrection whenever they experience this Resurrection in their bodies now Jesus said they will be like Angels now human beings are never turned into Angels you never were an angel and you never will be an angel now your angel beholds your father's face but you were always a man or a woman and you always will be right praise the Lord so watch what happens then these angels are Spirit beings and you know by reading your Bible of course that there never were any angels that were seen that look like women but they were always seen with the identification as men yet they don't have sexuality so it's not like a gender in the sense that we think of it because it's neither male nor female in that sense now notice again Jesus says neither can they die anymore for they are equal unto the angels and are the children of God being the children of the Resurrection so as he raised from the dead and was declared the son of the Living God so we being raised from the dead are declared the children of God by our Resurrection so it's already happened in our soul so we already have that deposit and it makes us live a worthy life well praise the Lord people oh it's just so hard to live a Christian Life it's not if you get the worthy one inside of you it's just as easy for a Christian to live a Christian Life as it is for a sinner to live their life in my view it's actually easier because at least our Master loves us and gave himself for us the devil don't love a one of his kids he has no heaven to take you to he has no healing when you get sick he has nothing he don't care if you cry he will never wipe your tears he'll never raise you up he'll never love you he'll never cuddle you in his arms the only time he cuddles you just to pull a knife out and stab you in the back but the Lord God loved you so much he come to this earth to die for you and set you free remember the devil cannot love he just simply can't do it now notice Jesus as he goes on boy these Sadducees by now they're fuming now that the dead are raised even Moses showed at the Bush when he cth the Lord the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob God would have never called himself the god of Abraham If Abraham was non-existent come on that would be like God saying he was the god of the past so by God saying to Moses I am the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob he was telling Moses Moses they're still alive cuz I can only be the god of the living amen hallelujah well if we could hear him speak back tonight he would say I am the the god of Jim bad I am the god of Homer Arnold on and on and on and on you would not hear him say that he's the god of any of those that died lost spiritually because he cannot be the god of the dead he is the god of the living that's why Elisha could say where is the Lord God of Elijah why because Elijah was not dead let me say to you tonight our friends our loved ones our family who have died in Christ Jesus he is just as much the god of Erica Parker tonight as he was when she was here in her Earthly body why because she is not dead praise the Lord hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus notice Jesus goes on to say for he is not a god of the dead but of the living for all live unto him now let's go back to 1 Corinthians 15: 40 there are also celestial bodies Heavenly in heaven existing in heaven of heavenly origin or nature there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial t e r r e s t r i a l oh my goodness look at them last five letters t r i a l anybody in here relate to that so there is a Celestial which is of heavenly origin and Heavenly nature and there is a terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another so it's bodies on Earth the terrestrial bodies on Earth either animate or inanimate so humans animals life cells and so on now watch this some things that are to be now we find this life holds all kinds of evil so therefore the life that is to come won't have it this one has lust and sickness and death because what is it it's not the house that he's going to prepare this is a pest house how many knows what a pest house is congregation says sure well that's what you're living in BO we love us so pesto don't we man man alive we treat this thing like it's a House of Gold we treat this thing like it's a palace a castle boy we stand before the mirror and comb that hair and brush them teeth and clean them fingernails and man a lie we manicure and we work on this and that and the other it's courteous so the rest of us don't have to smell you when to come to church that's really nice but that's not the reason most of us do it we do it because of that vain Pride that we've got Amen Brother D I see from this point on I'm about to preaching Amen to but I can do that I've done it before but you see there's something about this that we when we look at it from a Heavenly perspective we are not gods and goddesses come on now Hollywood has made this out of this age and generation that we're in to where that people worship people they worship human beings oh my think of it but it's actually a pest house well he said a pest house is where they put all the diseased people so every one of us here tonight are pled that's right our body speaks the house we live in speaks that were afflicted by disease everybody remember how it was in the days of Co well I guess some days ain't really gone either they're still here and if anybody you'd be close to anybody and they had their mask on and they sneezed People Pumped to the cash register would take off running early I mean nobody wanted to be around nobody and then they finally proved all that whole thing was nothing but a big makeup and lie in the first place that's right yes sir well come on now and you realize that yet oh none of us wanted Co I didn't want it either I wound up getting it some of you wound up getting it was pretty bad but yet when you look at it even though we get over cold and flu and Co and all the rest of and you think I'm so better you're not better your house tells that you're still diseased right your house is a witness oh my listen this they wouldn't let anyone else come in the pestil because there's all kinds of germs flying around in there and the people will take these germs and be sick themselves and sin brought us into the devil's pastur oh but listen this oh but the other one is called my father's house now remember he's quoting St John 141 let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me for in my father's house are many mensions now he said it's not so much a house or a building it's a tabernacle in my father's kingdom are many Tabernacles amen many Tabernacles that's called my father's house so what happened to Erica Lance she moved out of the body that her father and her mother prepared for her she loved flowers so I built her a little flower bed and a couple things out on the side put her a canopy out on the back porch so she could sit out there and look at it I was down there yesterday morning and I looked around the corner of the house cuz I used to do it when she's still here and she'd be out there sitting on the porch and I'd way better but she wasn't there yesterday but I thought as her daddy I wanted to do that for her and then I had another thought if I would do that as her Earthly father yes sir what has her Heavenly Father prepared right here you go you see genetically I pass things to her genetically her mother passed things to her through our DNA and this and that and the other and also genetically her heavenly father passed things to her and that was when she prayed and believed and we prayed and believed and one of the last things Carol I was talking about it today one of the last things say she said to her daughter one of her daughters what a testimony it was when she said don't you ever forget it we serve a mighty God hallelujah I believe I helped mole that in her to say that I believe her mama helped mow that in her to say it but it was her heavenly father because that was on his list oh my it it ain't hard for people to rejoice when God sends a miracle and God sends a Divine Healing they're able to stand up glory to God I had cancer and God healed me I had cancer and God sent me a miracle but can we still say Amen whenever we pray and we pray and God takes him can we still say glory to God God's still in charge glory to God the Lord knows exactly what he's doing and the Lord does not make mistakes are you with me tonight church I can Rejoice tonight knowing where my daughter is knowing that the heavenly father has prepared a house for her not for her only but for every one of you that are sitting in this place tonight what is the rapture of AR Roose it's our theophany taking our body and the Soul joined together into my father's house you imagine early one morning brother Jack if you're still alive and with us you're moving around your house and trying to get up and get your coffee maybe get you a little bite to eat and all of a sudden this beautiful young woman steps into the room praise God she may reach out of her hand and all of a sudden the change will strike brother Jack and he'll go from 90s something whatever he is back to an 18y old man in a moment in the twinkling of an eye Hallelujah pray you therefore always that you may be accounted worthy to escape aren't you glad friends an escape has been made but we've got to know the way out we can't go on our own way we've got to have the special instruction all down through time when men have been in prison when the Confederacy held the Northerners they tried to dig under the wall whenever they opposite the same way and they tried to find a way out and you had to be included in those on the inside that was doing it so is it with the Rapture God has sent down not just another message not just another evangelist but God has sent down a rapturing message what is that rapturing message it's the instructions for the Escape Hallelujah there's certain things we've got to do there's certain ways we've got to behave there's certain ways we talk there's certain language that we have that only the initiated understand oh but the other one is called my father's house I go and prepare a place for you take you out of this best house and deliver you into my father's house I'm sure you know it but I want to update you at the resurrection the graves will not be opened in the way people are thinkinking well praise the Lord I got some of you's attention it's not the Angels coming down with a shovel that's right don't try to look at me funny I'm quoting you a quote it is not the Angels coming down with a shovel and digging out them bodies his blood dripped upon the Earth and the Earth is made out of those elements don't you understand this is one one one reason why that the Rapture will be a mystery you know what some church people's going to do they're going to go straight to the cemetery and you know what they'll find nothing right they will find no change it's not like that they're going to find you know big holes iron bodies is gone out no God speaks God speaks it ain't like you're going to go over there to Happy Valley and oh my oh my there'll be Erica's grave and there'll be Jim bab and there'll be brother Randy G and there'll be brother and sister ster and we go to their head on oh brother stamper's gone sister stamper's gone there won't be one hole oh my oh my hallelujah hallelujah wow all the Earth contains that same thing for many of them that were eat up in the wastage of the lion and their bodies cast out of I stood several years ago on the catacombs of Rome and where some of them Christians would go there to have church and where some of them were buried while there wasn't enough dust there and enough Ashes to fill a tablespoon and once it breaks down from a from ashes it goes back to acids and gases and finally disappears and there's absolutely nothing left but the Creator will speak the resurrection will take place and Out of the Dust of the earth they will come he might right go in your backyard and bring her body right out of the backyard sister Lindy may go out of your backyard and call Brother Jim he may go who knows where you'll go it's not the Angels going down and digging up them bodies Our Father speaks and the resurrection oh Hallelujah don't you understand it'll be the same voice that you've heard all your life glory to God this is part of the list my wife must be able to meet me in the resurrection an absolute requirement I require of her how can we meet that requirement we can't so he rolls up the requirement and embeds it in our DNA and when he speaks on that Resurrection morning it don't make no difference if they burd you in the sea that's right it won't make no difference if a lion ate you and you come out of the wastage of the lion you it's all gone but all them other ones calcium potach petroleum Cosmic lights copper magnesium all those things the Earth is full of it so maybe some Nebraska Farmers out there plowing for the spring crop and the Lord says this is a good field to raise about free me and of my kids up get up children Hallelujah well friends we've got too much Church tradition I know some of you got this awful shocked look on your face surely you didn't think that the Angels was going to come down with a shovel he speaks glory to God he's gone to prepare a place place a perfect place where no evil exist no sickness exist no old age exists no deaths exist it's a perfect place calling youall to that Perfection see it's not just you it's not just you wanting to go that want in you to go is simply the response of it calling you thank you Jesus thank you Jesus if there was no no place to go to that' be no Desiring us to want to go but there's not only a place but that place is calling you it's embedded in the list it's embedded in Who You Are thank you if there was no promise in the New Testament that there was a land I know there would have to be one you said why brother Donnie because there's something in me longing for a place it's a perfect place calling you to that Perfection and you have to be perfect to get there the Bible said so Jesus said be there for perfect even as your Father in Heaven is perfect it's a perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect people come because you have to stand and be married to a perfect Son of God sir and you must be a perfect Pride yes sir so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of God which is the Waters of Separation that washes us from our sins amen that's right the blood of Jesus Christ think of it the dripping bloody word amen the blood the word of God bleeding blood to wash the bride amen yes sir she stands perfect virgin unadulterated she never S I want you to notice a title of this sermon things that are to be Rialto California you know where the sermon was preached an Assembly of God Church can you imagine

comprehend this can you imagine them people sitting there three Gods baptized and titles all this stuff but you know what God had this message on his prophet's heart it's got to be preached there's some things he said right here in this sermon he never said in the entire for run years of the message nowhere else was it said like it was said right here there was something calling what was it God

the closet in other words a grave for you got one better you got a better coat it's more up to take than the one you used to wear that worn out it's the Garment you you are the inside of that there that garment only done it bore your image but you don't need it anymore it anymore yes sir you've hung it up it's a rag well glory to God that's the way this whole body is it's more the image of the Heavenly yet it is it is not you yes you are on the inside of that body you I hope you can take this you the spirit of God that's rightall Lord have mercy you the spirit of God is on the inside of that body that's what makes the outside commence subjection friend this is why that the people that that go to church they can't make their body obey the word they see no need to right they see no need the church did not receive the list they don't receive the list so natural they'll never measure up they see no need to do it they see no need to quit drinking quit smoking quit lying quit running around just accept Jesus as your savior and that's it they see no need to do it it's not in bread in their experience that's as far as they'll ever go but you receive the list thank you Lord in your seed and it calls you high remember we are astronauts hallelujah hallelujah you don't want nobody trying to put no no oats in your tank do you you was here Sunday morning you heard what I said about pulling up to the Gas Pump and you see some old men out or Amish or whatever more with a gas hole stuck in the mouth of his donkey or his horse and that old horse in her Bing and burping that gasoline why it's the wrong fuel for the wrong tank amen that's why I say friends we got to have more than a Pentecostal stir in order to get this spaceship off the ground we got to have more than a Baptist justification we got to have more than a Methodist sanctification we've got to go all the way back to the original seed word that'll produce enough energy that in a moment in a twinkling of an eye the rapturing power will strike the Earth Millions will be raised up Millions maybe will be changed just like [Music] that let me find a place to land this spaceship that's what makes the outside come in subjections because the inside is pulling it bringing it in line with the word of God your Insight you yourself you yourself your being this body is just an O Cod and someday what will you do with it it was only in the Garment for a while that was the Earthly garment this body your real body your real self is on the inside of this old coat that you call William brandham or Susie Jones or whoever it is someday it will hang in Earth's Hall of memory of you you'll put it Yonder in the grave somebody will put a tombstone up here lies Reverend so and so John so and so and so and so it'll lie there as a memorial of you the people just seen you in this let's stand let me finish reading this and what you was your real you was on the inside of that but the old coat itself just borne the image of the Heavenly oh people have you made reservations to change coats have you made reservations to change coats praise God yes you see the bride receives that also on the list it's a personal invite to change goats for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God for the trumpet shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first we which are alive and remain shall be caught up caught up we're caught up in the Escape remember if it's only 20 ft from where we are half of this ceiling look up 20 ft from the floor up in another dimension is Paul Peter Erica your grandma your mother your husband your daughter in another dimension praise be to God so the Rapture is making all the bride change coats and one last move so it's just like and everybody changes Coates yes when they go by the way of the Grave one by one that cross the river into the land of the sweet forever but the Rapture culminates and all the living changing coats at the same time wouldn't it be something of wiing church and that happened I had a dream about it several years ago it's just a dream and in the dream brother Buzz Livingston I was standing there talking to him was outside the for to other church and I was just standing there talking to him and there other some other brothers there and I started watching brother buzz and it started with his fingers and it started moving up his entire body and there was others and they was doing the same thing and then I looked at myself and the same thing was happening to me what was it wardrobe change changeing coats but God's going to do something real Supernatural for us won't be no Graves needed for us glory to God amen glory to God no Undertakers you can go ahead and buy your buy your Tombstone if you want to pay for it Advance if that's what you wish to do but there's going to be some people on the Earth that don't have their plot picked out so done have the casket picked

understand why the son of man had to come to the Earth in this last day to call called a bride together to stand before him praise God how many would just say Lord I want to be there with all of my heart would you just raise your hand to the Lord God bless you men women boys girls preachers deacons trustees I hope all of us your pastor has both hands up Heavenly Father oh I've been wanting to bring this to him for a while it's been burning in My Heart Lord since I first heard about heaven so many years ago and it was so vague what I heard but after just hearing about it as a child I started having a longing and a craving to go I heard your pro Prophet saying the other day that you started dealing with his heart and he didn't even know how to pray so he said he wrote you a letter and tacked it on a tree in the woods and then he said he thought well I probably should try to speak to him so he knelt in that old shed and he said he didn't know what to say and didn't know how to pray but he said he seen a picture one time of somebody praying and they had their hands folded a certain way so he folded his hands that certain way and uh dear sir he said I I I I just I wanted to talk to you I wanted to speak to you and he said he you didn't say nothing back and he said sir uh I'm a terrible person I want to speak to you and he said a light appeared on the wall and it made a a noise and he said he said sir maybe you can't speak my language and I can't speak yours but if you've forgiven me would you let that light come back on the wall and he said there it appear again and as he said I headed out of that shed hooping and hollering he said oh if I'd only know how to dance in the spirit then he said and I thought you're was the prophet messenger of the age and when you found him he didn't even know how to pray he wrote you a letter he didn't know if you understood his language but he had the list embedded in his spiritual DNA all the time he just didn't know it was there so I heard Carol the other night telling the young people her testimony I saw the look on their faces whenever she told that she'd give her heart to you at the age of 16 she never heard the story of Daniel and the lion stand she never heard the story of David and Goliath she never heard it till after she was 16 years old she didn't know it but it was in her spiritual DNA embedded the list that she was called to be the bride of Christ and I believe with all of my heart she was called to be my bride as well we look back was talking about it this week out of our ignorance and how you brought us together it was just your grace Lord we thank you tonight oh Jesus we worship you father we're here to love you tonight father if there's one without the Holy Ghost May the spirit of God fall upon them right here tonight in this place while I waake till Sunday may they be filled right now Lord Jesus there's one out sitting in their living room in their car and maybe in their office

meetings we had there I said this may be the last time on this side that I'll ever see you if it is I'll be looking for you on the other side and if we get there that day we can say the only reason we're there friends is by his grace is that not true you look at your life and you think that when you was a young child the Lord wooed you and called you and I remember when I was 21 year old and had just got out of the army and had all kinds of habits in my life and but I was down in an old building in Jonesboro and the Lord came into the room that day and I knew it was him because I felt him when I was a boy he wounded us and call us to himself we are to be the happiest people on earth when this world has gone totally insane that we have also lost our mind because we receed the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word for this hour what a privilege it is amen sorry brother Donnie I didn't realize you Lord Jesus our little sister wants to come and be baptized father
