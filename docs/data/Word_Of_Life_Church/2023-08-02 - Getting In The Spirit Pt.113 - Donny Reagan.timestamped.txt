[35:09] different facets but one God's been good
[35:13] to me and I'm glad he's been good too I
[35:14] mean I know he loves me that he's been
[35:16] good to me but
[35:18] one thing I love about God is is he let
[35:21] me understand that in this age of
[35:23] laodicea when they don't want to be
[35:25] corrected
[35:27] God loves his people so much he corrects
[35:31] them
[35:32] and his people love him back for
[35:34] correcting him
[35:35] so when brother Downey has to come out
[35:37] and preach hard to us and preach all

[36:32] morning
[36:34] it's like a picture that you paid it
[36:40] for me
[36:44] a love lettering
[36:47] in the sky
[36:50] [Music]
[36:56] stories Lord I could have had a really
[37:01] different
[37:04] stories
[37:05] but you came down from heaven to restore
[37:12] say
[37:15] [Music]
[37:18] leave my life everybody now with all
[37:22] your heart

[38:30] thank you Lord
[38:32] Nobody Loves Me Like You Do
[38:40] [Music]
[38:42] thank you Lord praise the Lord praise
[38:46] the Lord
[38:48] I'll go ahead and give him a hand he's
[38:50] worthy of it
[38:52] thank you Father
[38:56] thank you Father
[38:57] praise the Lord let me knows that's the
[39:00] truth
[39:01] a mama's love can be a great thing a
[39:03] Father's Love friends that are as
[39:06] faithful as they can be
[39:08] but nobody can love you like Jesus turn
[39:12] with me tonight the book of Romans if
[39:14] you would Romans chapter 12. verse 4.
[39:21] Romans 12 4.
[39:24] for as we have many members and one body
[39:29] and all members have not the same office
[39:33] so we being many are
[39:36] one body in Christ
[39:39] and everyone
[39:41] members
[39:43] of one another
[39:45] now God made Islands there's some
[39:48] beautiful islands in the world I've seen
[39:49] some
[39:51] but God never made a human being
[39:53] to be one
[39:55] islands are made out of dirt
[39:58] volcanic pumice
[40:00] and all that sort of thing
[40:02] islands are not intended to be made out
[40:04] of flesh and blood
[40:09] Satan is the one who makes Islands out
[40:12] of people
[40:14] so that people will pull away from the
[40:16] body and then when they get in trouble
[40:18] they have nobody to help them
[40:22] because they're an island
[40:25] so listen what Paul said so we being
[40:27] many are one body and one body in Christ
[40:30] every one
[40:32] members of
[40:34] one another
[40:36] having then gifts differing according to
[40:41] the grace that is given to us whether
[40:43] prophecy let us prophesy according to
[40:46] the proportion of Faith now listen how
[40:50] gifts will operate
[40:52] so if a person has prophecy they can
[40:55] only prophesy according to the
[40:57] proportion of faith that is given to
[41:00] them or Ministry let us wait
[41:05] on our ministering so a person who feels
[41:09] like they're called to preach in the
[41:10] first trip they want to make is
[41:12] Johannesburg or Durbin South Africa or
[41:14] something like that they're contrary to
[41:16] the scripture unless of course they're
[41:18] from Durbin
[41:20] Jesus had his disciples to start at home
[41:24] yeah that's right so Ministry let us
[41:27] wait on our ministry or he that teaches
[41:30] on teaching or he that exhort us on
[41:35] exhortation
[41:37] he that give us let him do it with
[41:40] simplicity so now we move from gifts as
[41:42] far as ministerial gifts and things like
[41:44] that then we move into people that are
[41:47] gifted by God to be able to give
[41:51] things other than spiritual
[41:52] Administration let him do it with
[41:55] simplicity he that rule us so here's
[41:59] position holders in the church he that
[42:02] rule us with diligence
[42:05] he that show us Mercy with
[42:09] cheerfulness
[42:11] I'm a lot to be remembered tonight as we
[42:12] pray God bless you hold your needs your
[42:15] requests on your heart
[42:18] father we're so honored tonight that we
[42:20] once again could be gathered together
[42:22] Lord in this place that we have built
[42:25] dedicated
[42:27] for saving for healing for deliverance
[42:31] or worship for prayer
[42:34] it's not gathered as an arena
[42:37] it's not gathered so that we could come
[42:39] for entertainment
[42:41] it's a place of worship
[42:43] and when you were here you said it is
[42:45] written my house shall be called a House
[42:49] of Prayer
[42:51] so we've not come to look at one
[42:53] another's hats want another shoes one
[42:56] another's garments but we've come to
[42:59] worship
[43:00] we're going to worship when we feel like
[43:02] it
[43:03] we're going to worship when we don't
[43:05] we're going to worship when we're well
[43:07] we're going to worship when we're sick
[43:10] because this is not a house of when you
[43:13] feel like it
[43:14] it is not a house of just when you are
[43:16] well
[43:17] it is a house of worship and prayer and
[43:21] exhortation so when we enter these doors
[43:23] we're going to pray we enter we're going
[43:25] to praise we're going to worship we're
[43:28] going to do everything we can
[43:30] to be able to make a difference we want
[43:33] hell to know we've had church tonight
[43:37] we want the angels of God to know that
[43:40] we had church and we want you to know
[43:43] when we showed up at church we didn't
[43:45] sleep through the service we didn't
[43:47] barely make it through but we were
[43:49] participators
[43:51] so father we're asking tonight in the
[43:53] name of Jesus take the service take the
[43:56] word Lord you see this prayer cloth that
[43:58] I have in my hand
[44:00] father brother Michael Bayless was a
[44:02] granddaughter with her eye Lord you see
[44:05] this child
[44:06] Lord or I Crossing and still not quite
[44:09] right
[44:11] Lord whenever I think of that of course
[44:14] I think of brother random's little girl
[44:17] and your God ever across that child that
[44:19] come across the platform was healed
[44:22] but also think of something closer to my
[44:24] heart
[44:25] many years ago as I stood in Alabama and
[44:27] laid hands on a little boy about 14
[44:30] years old
[44:31] whose eyes were so crossed
[44:34] poor little fella couldn't even read
[44:37] but I saw you by your great miraculous
[44:40] power
[44:41] straighten his eyes right there in that
[44:43] service
[44:45] also think of my dear wife as she stands
[44:48] here tonight
[44:49] and she'll drag out the picture every
[44:50] now and then
[44:52] whenever she was little
[44:54] and her eyes were so terribly crossed
[44:57] glasses on
[44:59] father we know you straighten out eyes
[45:03] so we're praying over this prayer calls
[45:05] tonight in the name of Jesus
[45:07] may this child's eyes be straightened
[45:10] out
[45:12] speak to us tonight from your word
[45:13] father in the name of Jesus we ask him
[45:17] and the Saints said amen
[45:19] God bless you you may be seated
[45:25] aren't you glad to be a part of the body
[45:26] of Christ
[45:29] not only a part of the body of Christ
[45:31] but
[45:33] part of a local body wherever it is for
[45:35] your visitors whether it's tonight
[45:36] wherever it is that you go or some of
[45:39] you that are streaming and I know
[45:41] there's many that stream that don't have
[45:43] a midweek service
[45:44] so wherever it is that God has placed
[45:48] you in that assembly that God has given
[45:52] you a responsibility
[45:55] people I don't think still look at
[45:57] church quite right
[45:59] they almost look at church like a
[46:02] grocery store or a place to shop
[46:05] so if they prefer Ross above TJ Maxx
[46:08] then all of a sudden they change their
[46:10] preference to Target and then they go
[46:13] there it's sort of the way people look
[46:15] at church you know they just choose it
[46:17] on some of the strangest things I hear
[46:21] from message people some of the
[46:23] strangest most bizarre reasons for
[46:28] leaving One Church to go to another I
[46:31] mean it just absolutely will blow your
[46:33] mind
[46:34] some of the things that people say and
[46:37] it makes me realize that a lot of folks
[46:41] don't understand what church is for and
[46:44] really what you're supposed to choose
[46:46] your church by and the reason that you
[46:49] go to this particular church or another
[46:52] church wherever it is but first of all
[46:55] it should be that the presence of God is
[46:59] what is drawing you now God is the only
[47:01] one that can put us into the mystical
[47:03] body which is by the baptism of the Holy
[47:06] Ghost but then there is local assemblies
[47:09] and we thank God for them around the
[47:11] world that are there as a station a
[47:14] soul-saving station they're there to
[47:16] strengthen to elect and I've been
[47:19] privileged by the grace of God to stand
[47:20] and preach in many of them around the
[47:22] world and it's always it's always such a
[47:25] blessing because when you go you find
[47:27] every one of them are unique having
[47:29] standing in different parts of Africa
[47:31] and Kenya and Tanzania Zimbabwe Uganda
[47:34] South Africa and every one of them even
[47:36] though you all might categorize them as
[47:38] being merely Africans every one of them
[47:40] are different you go from you go from
[47:42] Brother Commodities church and Nairobi
[47:44] which is made up a lot of people who
[47:46] live from the rural areas and they'll
[47:48] come there and work and they will attend
[47:50] that church but yet their family may be
[47:52] back out here and there and there and
[47:55] then you go out in some of the rural
[47:56] areas and it'll be a little bit
[47:58] different you go over to Tanzania
[48:00] different different National Spirit
[48:02] there so they're just a little bit
[48:03] different go to Zimbabwe different again
[48:06] same way with with the states then you
[48:08] go to Mexico and you find a lot of the
[48:11] churches there been to several of them
[48:12] there going to South America Central
[48:15] America you go there a little different
[48:17] and you sing and that each one of us
[48:19] tend to sing that our church is the
[48:22] church God uses as the example but let
[48:25] me just let you in on a little bit the
[48:27] churches in South America don't even
[48:29] sing like us they don't act like us you
[48:32] know now the Holy Ghost moves on
[48:33] somebody it'll move the same way but
[48:36] some of you would be totally surprised
[48:38] if you would go in Latin America and
[48:39] you'd find their music don't sound
[48:41] nothing like ours at all it don't sound
[48:43] absolutely nothing like it you go to
[48:45] Guadalajara go to that part of Mexico
[48:47] and then you go down to Venezuela's I've
[48:49] been my brother George Smith several
[48:51] times and then you go to Africa every
[48:53] one of them is a little bit different
[48:55] and yet no doubt every one of them feel
[48:57] like that in the Millennium will all
[49:00] sway just like them everybody will move
[49:03] back and forth and everybody will do
[49:04] because that's what we tend to think and
[49:07] that's what we believe no doubt most of
[49:10] the people The Word of Life think that
[49:12] in the Millennium everybody been
[49:13] worshiping just like us but I don't
[49:15] agree with you all as a matter of fact I
[49:17] believe that it'll be diverse as it is
[49:20] here in this life that people will be
[49:22] made different and God made them that
[49:24] way and we were to do ourselves and
[49:26] other people a great Injustice whenever
[49:29] we want to use our church or our
[49:31] personal preference of a church and we
[49:34] use that that as the example church but
[49:36] when you read the New Testament and I'd
[49:38] like to take each one of them churches
[49:40] sometime and take every one of them by
[49:44] name the Ephesian church the laodicean
[49:46] church everyone in the Church of
[49:48] thessalonica and every one of them and
[49:50] show you the characteristics and the
[49:52] traits of those churches and the issues
[49:54] that were in those churches and you'll
[49:55] find out that what none of them exactly
[49:59] the same way because God makes them
[50:02] different and God calls them and makes
[50:05] them up from a colitos scope of the
[50:07] world and you come as people that were
[50:09] Greeks that were Phoenicians people from
[50:12] Cappadocia people from Jewish background
[50:14] people from Heathen background all kinds
[50:17] of different things and whenever they
[50:19] would come and get saved and filled with
[50:21] the Holy Ghost they would still bring an
[50:23] element of their Humanity with them now
[50:26] the Corinthian Church was a very gifted
[50:29] church it was one of the most gifted
[50:31] churches that we know about in the New
[50:34] Testament but yet they were a church
[50:36] with lots of problems not every church
[50:39] has its problems and the the Ephesian
[50:43] church was totally different they were
[50:45] one of the deeper churches in the New
[50:47] Testament but yet they still had their
[50:50] problems and Paul had to write to them
[50:52] husbands on how to love their wives well
[50:55] you'd think a deep Christian would know
[50:57] that but apparently some of the deep
[50:58] Brothers of Ephesus didn't know how to
[51:01] love their wives right and some of them
[51:03] deep women in the Ephesian Church didn't
[51:06] know how to obey theirs and then some of
[51:08] the children in the Deep Ephesus Church
[51:11] didn't know that they should obey their
[51:13] parents and they didn't know that they
[51:16] should respect them so as you read the
[51:18] New Testament what you see is the
[51:21] diversity and God absolutely loves to
[51:24] diversify his body now he did it in the
[51:28] natural makeup of the body and he also
[51:30] did it in the spiritual makeup now think
[51:33] of all the preachers that you have heard
[51:35] since you've been saved and you think of
[51:38] how diverse they are now look at the
[51:40] special meetings that we have to have
[51:42] brother Tim of course brother Ron and
[51:44] Brother David all three of them great
[51:46] brothers that love God that have been
[51:49] such a benefit to the bride and yet all
[51:51] three of them as different as they could
[51:54] be and the way they preach in the way
[51:57] that they Minister even in the way that
[52:00] they would be able to pray for people in
[52:01] the prayer line but aren't you glad God
[52:04] Don't Make ever preacher exactly the
[52:06] same way well God doesn't make the laity
[52:08] the same way either and God doesn't
[52:11] actually allow our trials and our tests
[52:15] to be the same way either now God let
[52:18] every one of his members now all of them
[52:20] that come this same way that all be
[52:23] bound with alcohol that all be bound
[52:26] with cigarettes and that all be bound
[52:28] will save a pornography then all of them
[52:30] got delivered and that's all that every
[52:33] one of God's children ever ever dealt
[52:35] with and God would save them all deliver
[52:37] them from smoking deliver them from
[52:39] alcohol and deliver them from porn well
[52:41] then what about all the rest of these
[52:44] sins out here that his bride would never
[52:47] conquer so what did God do God let his
[52:50] seed fall among heathens thank God I was
[52:53] one of them God let his seed fall among
[52:55] church people and fall here and fall
[52:58] there they were born under different
[53:00] strains under different things and they
[53:02] come from all these different
[53:04] backgrounds some of them will overcome
[53:06] porn some will overcome drinking some of
[53:09] them never drunk A Drop in their life
[53:11] some of them never smoked a cigarette in
[53:13] their life and they was as lost as
[53:15] everyone of them people that did so God
[53:18] would bring them from all different
[53:20] backgrounds that he could show by his
[53:23] grace he could save her drunk as well as
[53:26] he could a church member that was just
[53:28] as much Bound for hell as the drunk was
[53:30] and yet God allowed it to be so that his
[53:34] his grace would be able to reach to
[53:37] every one of them and redeem them all
[53:39] and then when they are redeemed they
[53:42] come to the spirit of God and then they
[53:45] find a church now the Corinthian Church
[53:47] of course was the one that God spoke to
[53:50] Paul and said I have much people in this
[53:54] city now he was there for about 18
[53:56] months one of the longest places that he
[53:59] was in the New Testament brother sister
[54:01] this man had his hands full at that
[54:04] church now some of these were former
[54:07] prostitutes in the house of worship at a
[54:11] starting some of them were former
[54:13] prostitutes and the worship place that
[54:16] come from Demopolis some of them oh Lord
[54:19] some of the things that they did I I'm
[54:22] not even eloquent enough to be able to
[54:25] describe it to you tonight it would be
[54:27] 45 x rated
[54:30] that's how bad it was and yet God had
[54:33] some of them people that was his all
[54:36] they had to do save them fill them of
[54:38] the Holy Ghost but yet they brought an
[54:41] actual element with them you see sin
[54:43] itself is also very Diversified now it
[54:48] would probably surprise some of us here
[54:50] tonight to know some of the sins and
[54:52] some of the background of the saints
[54:55] that are here and you'd say you used to
[54:57] do that oh yeah I used to ride a Harley
[54:59] I was one of them guys you know so I
[55:01] said oh no no no surely not and I'm
[55:04] going to say well my goodness I've never
[55:06] done nothing like that well I've done
[55:08] this and that oh my goodness you mean
[55:09] you've done that you was caught up in
[55:12] that sort of thing yeah well that's the
[55:14] way God does Satan diversifies in a
[55:18] similarity the way that God does so if
[55:20] what a throne is sin that Satan had was
[55:23] just a Harley's and and chopper
[55:26] motorcycles and he had people with long
[55:28] hair and leather jackets while for long
[55:31] there wouldn't be enough cows to make
[55:32] leather out of but you know what Satan's
[55:35] got tastes for the affluent upper class
[55:39] Satan's got sin for the white collar
[55:42] he's got sand for the blue collar he's
[55:45] got sin for the no caller because why he
[55:48] diversifies sin at just the same way God
[55:52] diversifies the measure of Grace then
[55:55] God also diversifies the administration
[55:58] once we are saved and brought into the
[56:01] body now we know we all have preference
[56:04] I do I'll be honest with you those
[56:07] brothers that minister to me better than
[56:09] others do and I have preference I've got
[56:12] to be honest there's preachers that I
[56:15] get more out of what they say than I do
[56:18] others but I'm going to be honest also
[56:20] and say it to you this way I have never
[56:22] went to church and ever even when I was
[56:26] in Pentecost never did I go to church
[56:29] that I did not at least get a little
[56:33] something out of that service even if
[56:36] that preacher was not really my favorite
[56:38] preacher I are one that I really
[56:41] struggled in trying to understand you
[56:43] know the way you would lay it out and
[56:45] I'm sitting there I'm just I'm trying to
[56:46] think okay where in the world is he
[56:48] going with this and I'm sitting there
[56:50] and he's done what beyond the horizontal
[56:52] rainbow and he's standing over here with
[56:53] no one the art and I'm still trying to
[56:55] figure out your grandma and saying what
[56:57] in the world is that man even talking
[56:58] about but I've wounded if you'll go and
[57:01] you're really opened up and that's a
[57:04] god-called man that you'll be able to
[57:06] get something out of what he's got to
[57:08] say I don't believe the Lord wants us to
[57:11] come to the house of God and leave
[57:13] empty-handed but does that mean that
[57:15] individual will be one of your favorite
[57:17] preachers probably not but yet God has
[57:21] them for all different reasons and all
[57:23] different purposes now the the
[57:25] Corinthians Church seem to have a great
[57:29] explosion of spiritual gifts I know it's
[57:33] all types of administration I imagine
[57:36] they had all kinds of preachers they had
[57:38] all kinds of tongue talkers they had
[57:40] people that was prophesying that as
[57:42] people there was no doubts and Visions
[57:44] having dreams all kinds of things like
[57:47] that now you wonder why would God empty
[57:49] so much out of that church and yet we
[57:52] don't have any other record in any of
[57:54] the rest of the churches that Paul ever
[57:56] dealt with any gift issues at the other
[57:58] churches yeah brother Branham said they
[58:00] had gifts and those other churches too
[58:03] so somehow they had learned an
[58:06] understanding of how to be able to catch
[58:09] the administration and make them work
[58:11] effectively for the body but there was
[58:14] still a lot of selfishness because the
[58:17] big portion of the Corinthian Church was
[58:19] gentiles
[58:23] hahaha
[58:25] gentiles
[58:30] so they had a lot of problems with
[58:32] jealousy
[58:35] and measuring one another
[58:38] now the problem will always be when we
[58:42] will measure ourselves by ourselves
[58:47] okay so then when we are the measuring
[58:50] tape then we will measure ourselves by
[58:53] our view and we will also measure others
[58:56] by our view now don't sit there and look
[58:59] at me like you know what I'm talking
[59:00] about and if you this ever visited
[59:02] another church or you some of you just
[59:05] come back from camps and you went here
[59:06] and there and there and they do the same
[59:08] in a certain way and they do the music a
[59:10] certain way and the preacher will preach
[59:12] a certain way or maybe you go to another
[59:14] church and say wow we don't do that in
[59:16] our church all you see you know what you
[59:18] do you drug out your measuring tape boy
[59:20] I wish they'd do this all right brother
[59:22] Louie but you know what there's only one
[59:24] by the Louie since they're going to say
[59:26] and thank God for that
[59:29] there's only one no matter where you go
[59:32] you know there'll be only one Pastor
[59:34] like that one song leader like that and
[59:36] God knows how to do it that way but we
[59:39] can't help as humans from being that way
[59:42] but what we can help is allowing that to
[59:46] dominate what we get out of the service
[59:48] I'm measuring everybody else by our
[59:51] opinion and our thoughts because you
[59:53] know what they might have some quotes to
[59:55] be able to prove or scriptures the
[59:57] reason they do it this way that you
[59:59] aren't aware of and then you're sitting
[1:00:02] there singing oh my goodness and you're
[1:00:04] you're driving the measuring tape out of
[1:00:06] your heart and I'll tell you one thing
[1:00:07] we just cut it to 30 minutes and that's
[1:00:10] as far as our special singing goes and
[1:00:12] they won 47 and a half now I've got a
[1:00:15] problem with that tonight you know so we
[1:00:17] we do it all the time I'm not sure of
[1:00:19] how much aware that we really are and
[1:00:23] the Corinthian Church must have been
[1:00:24] really bad measuring tape people because
[1:00:28] in the way that Paul all had to deal
[1:00:30] with them but let's be gracious to them
[1:00:32] because from the time that first
[1:00:34] corinthus was written by the time second
[1:00:36] Corinthians was written which was a few
[1:00:38] years had elapsed there was a great
[1:00:40] change in this church now termite me to
[1:00:43] First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 12
[1:00:45] and watch Paul now as he's going to
[1:00:48] bring bring them a great Parable and
[1:00:51] he's going to use a parabolic symbol and
[1:00:55] he's going to type it like the human
[1:00:57] body to help them to see how diverse
[1:01:01] their human body is and maybe God would
[1:01:04] use this no doubt Paul fell inspired I
[1:01:06] believe he did to be able to use the
[1:01:08] human body and the human anatomy to be
[1:01:12] able to show the Corinthian Believers
[1:01:14] that as they were diverse and they had
[1:01:17] different functions in the spiritual
[1:01:19] body that even though God mirrored that
[1:01:21] by the natural body so he said as the
[1:01:24] body is one and has many members and all
[1:01:27] the members of that one on body being
[1:01:30] many are one body so also is Christ now
[1:01:35] watch so he starts with the natural man
[1:01:38] and he will take just the Big Image
[1:01:42] first before he breaks it down now he
[1:01:44] says as the body is one so here I stand
[1:01:49] tonight as one you're sending those one
[1:01:52] I'm sitting there and yet I have all
[1:01:55] these different members all these
[1:01:57] different things I've got all these
[1:01:59] cells and all these things in my body
[1:02:01] that do all these different things but
[1:02:03] yet when you call Donnie all of them
[1:02:06] will answer under what one voice so I am
[1:02:10] only one person yet I've got all these
[1:02:13] systems that are at work inside my body
[1:02:15] I've got the emphatics I've got the
[1:02:18] lungs I've got all these other things
[1:02:20] that are working or when they're
[1:02:21] properly functioning what a wonderful
[1:02:23] saying a human being really is and yet
[1:02:26] all it takes is for one of them to get
[1:02:28] out of sink and get out of order and it
[1:02:31] can disrupt the whole anatomy of the
[1:02:34] human being depending upon the value of
[1:02:37] that system and it's the same way in the
[1:02:40] body of Christ now watch in verse 13 He
[1:02:42] said for by one Spirit are they all
[1:02:45] baptized into one body whether we be
[1:02:48] Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or
[1:02:52] free and have been all made to drink
[1:02:54] into one spirit for the body is not one
[1:02:59] member but many now watch what he's
[1:03:01] doing as a preacher he's laying a
[1:03:04] platform he's laying something out and
[1:03:07] he wants them to get a generic View and
[1:03:10] get a foundation okay Paul so what are
[1:03:12] you saying all right I'm trying to tell
[1:03:14] you that as you are a human being so is
[1:03:17] the mystical Body of Christ and as
[1:03:19] you've got fingers and you've got
[1:03:21] Knuckles and you've got sinew and tissue
[1:03:23] and sails and blood and you've got all
[1:03:25] these different things in your body yeah
[1:03:27] you are one a body and that's the way
[1:03:31] Christ is now he wants them to see
[1:03:33] because they're having problems being
[1:03:35] able to keep the order of his strength
[1:03:37] because why they're measuring each other
[1:03:41] by themselves so some would say have a
[1:03:44] gift and they would be a vocal gift
[1:03:46] we'll say it was speaking in tongues and
[1:03:48] they would speak in tongues and oh might
[1:03:50] might just make the hair raise up on the
[1:03:52] back of your neck and they were surely
[1:03:54] inspired by God to do it and then maybe
[1:03:56] someone else would interpret or someone
[1:03:58] else would prophesy because tongues of
[1:04:02] course a person standing there they're
[1:04:04] not even to do that before the
[1:04:05] congregation unless they'd be an
[1:04:07] interpreter so maybe that one would
[1:04:10] speak in tongues and there was no
[1:04:12] interpreter but someone with the gift of
[1:04:14] Prophecy would be able to stand up and
[1:04:16] they would say this this or this and
[1:04:19] then someone else said and I said well
[1:04:20] I've never spoken tongues I've never
[1:04:22] prophesied apparently there's having
[1:04:25] some issues because the gifted people
[1:04:28] were looking down on the rest of the
[1:04:30] people that they thought were not gifted
[1:04:32] I'm thinking boy you're not very
[1:04:34] spiritual
[1:04:36] actually the truth of it is some of
[1:04:39] those gifted people were not very
[1:04:41] spiritual
[1:04:43] because in their sinking they were
[1:04:46] sinking that the gifted people in the
[1:04:49] spiritual sense were the only ones that
[1:04:52] were gifted
[1:04:53] but that's not true
[1:04:56] every person that is saved
[1:05:00] is gifted
[1:05:02] amen now yours may not be publicly it
[1:05:04] may not be to stand up and speak or
[1:05:06] speak in tongues but every one of you
[1:05:09] are called for a purpose I don't care
[1:05:12] who you are I don't care how little and
[1:05:15] how small you think you are you are
[1:05:18] called to minister to the body of Christ
[1:05:22] in one way or another
[1:05:24] now they were having a real hard time
[1:05:27] because they were so lifting up the
[1:05:30] spiritual ones so say even among the
[1:05:34] ministry apparently by the way that Paul
[1:05:35] had to deal with it so some of the ones
[1:05:38] that would say were more anointed than
[1:05:40] others let me know there's preachers
[1:05:41] like that there's preachers and they
[1:05:43] don't move around a lot they don't jump
[1:05:45] a lot and they just stand there and they
[1:05:48] speak and they can be just as anointed
[1:05:50] as the manners roaming and running
[1:05:52] around and jumping and all that hey I'll
[1:05:55] thank God for both of them but you know
[1:05:56] what I doubt very seriously that the
[1:05:59] Lord Jesus preached out brother Daryl I
[1:06:02] doubt very seriously the Lord Jesus
[1:06:04] preached out Brother David solar I doubt
[1:06:07] he preached like me the Bible said he
[1:06:10] set
[1:06:10] I'd opened his mouth and precious words
[1:06:13] come out of his mouth now could we have
[1:06:16] handled that
[1:06:17] could we have handled a man that would
[1:06:20] sit and teach so what what is it that
[1:06:23] gets our attention you see if we're not
[1:06:25] careful because we're born under a
[1:06:28] certain gift and many of you have been
[1:06:30] it's like your spiritual birthmark or
[1:06:34] your burst past it will always have an
[1:06:37] impact on your life the preacher or the
[1:06:40] ministers by which you were spiritually
[1:06:43] burst under and it will do something to
[1:06:46] you and there's people that I have a
[1:06:48] connection with around the world and
[1:06:50] always will through eternity because God
[1:06:53] used my Ministry to bring them to a new
[1:06:55] birth those others that brother Daryl is
[1:06:58] born every God call man that's the exact
[1:07:00] same thing and they will be identified
[1:07:02] with them and you can't help that
[1:07:03] there's a bond between you and that
[1:07:06] individual it's basically Indescribable
[1:07:08] there's just something about it and yet
[1:07:10] that does not mean that that's the only
[1:07:13] preacher for you but that gift and that
[1:07:16] style may make an imp friend upon you
[1:07:18] and you will always lean toward a
[1:07:21] certain way now some of you come from
[1:07:23] different churches maybe and whenever
[1:07:25] you finally arrived where God wanted you
[1:07:27] it was that Ministry that made that
[1:07:30] imprint on you totally transforms you
[1:07:32] totally changing well the truth of it is
[1:07:34] because that's when you got the Holy
[1:07:36] Ghost but whenever God does that it
[1:07:39] actually does something to you and
[1:07:42] changes your nature now this is what had
[1:07:44] happened to some of the Corinthian
[1:07:45] people they had been burst under a
[1:07:48] certain thing and many of them no doubt
[1:07:50] were just as emotional when they were
[1:07:53] Sinners oh that's what gets me is a lot
[1:07:55] of folks that you know that they they're
[1:07:57] a certain certain way and if you'd
[1:07:59] follow them back to their life they were
[1:08:02] that boy pretty much when they was a
[1:08:03] sinner
[1:08:05] but they want to attribute it toward us
[1:08:08] all right so they got the Holy Ghost but
[1:08:10] if they'll really recall themselves and
[1:08:12] they'll remember how they were when they
[1:08:14] got saved they were the life of the
[1:08:16] party when they was going to parties
[1:08:18] and what are they now the life of the
[1:08:21] party in church
[1:08:22] well praise the lord well they want to
[1:08:25] attribute that to all being spiritual no
[1:08:27] it's not always because they are
[1:08:30] spiritual it's because of their natural
[1:08:32] makeup
[1:08:34] now the Corinthian Church boy they was
[1:08:36] really having a struggle now Paul wants
[1:08:39] to bring it down to this simple way he
[1:08:41] said if the body for the body is not one
[1:08:44] member but many now you imagine their
[1:08:47] attention as it's coming out to themself
[1:08:49] their human anatomy and they might when
[1:08:52] they heard this preacher when they saw
[1:08:53] it in the writing that Paul had given to
[1:08:56] them and then they began to realize well
[1:08:58] I can see that I can see that what if my
[1:09:02] whole body was a hand
[1:09:04] wouldn't that be weird
[1:09:07] so can you imagine up here before you
[1:09:09] tonight was a walking
[1:09:12] five-fingered six foot 160 some pound
[1:09:15] man
[1:09:17] well not actually a man but a hand
[1:09:21] wouldn't that be strange
[1:09:23] are you imagine when Paul by the spirit
[1:09:26] of God begin to get their attention and
[1:09:28] I thought now that would be really
[1:09:29] really bizarre if I was just a walking
[1:09:34] hand
[1:09:37] well that's the way some folks are
[1:09:39] spiritually
[1:09:42] because they feel like
[1:09:44] they are all they need
[1:09:48] so they don't need a pastor they don't
[1:09:50] need a church they don't need one
[1:09:52] another whatever they think they are in
[1:09:55] Christ they think they're the entirety
[1:09:58] and they're an island
[1:10:00] well first of all that's contrary to the
[1:10:02] Bible second is contrary to the message
[1:10:05] now watch the way Paul says it's
[1:10:07] something that's really weird I mean how
[1:10:09] preachers can can type certain things
[1:10:11] like like Paul's fixing to do if the
[1:10:14] foot
[1:10:15] shall say
[1:10:19] okay now look I realize I'm not as smart
[1:10:21] as some of y'all all right
[1:10:23] but if any of you all ever seen a
[1:10:26] talking foot
[1:10:30] in this strange that Paul would take the
[1:10:32] anatomy and say something that was not
[1:10:36] even realistic
[1:10:38] this is not going to happen it never has
[1:10:40] happened and never will happen you
[1:10:43] believe God led the man to use this
[1:10:45] now wonder why because the spirit of God
[1:10:49] knew that would be something about
[1:10:51] taking the anatomy of a human being and
[1:10:55] being able to make the connection that
[1:10:57] would send a spiritual message that
[1:11:00] would reverberate for two thousand years
[1:11:02] I wonder how many times this has been
[1:11:04] preached on since Paul wrote it I wonder
[1:11:07] how many saints of God around the world
[1:11:09] their eyes have come open when their
[1:11:12] Pastor or an evangelist or a teacher or
[1:11:15] a prophet begin to deal with this in the
[1:11:17] word wonder why well if they're normal
[1:11:20] every one of them have a hand
[1:11:23] and a foot
[1:11:25] now every one of us do not have the gift
[1:11:28] of Prophecy ever one of us do not see
[1:11:30] Visions every one of us may not have
[1:11:32] spiritual dreams every one of us may not
[1:11:35] prophesy or do this or that or the other
[1:11:37] so why didn't God use that God wanted
[1:11:40] this man to use something that the
[1:11:43] majority of the people could be able to
[1:11:45] look at on their own
[1:11:48] and say wow
[1:11:50] if the foot shall say
[1:11:54] because I am not the hand
[1:11:57] I am not of the body now I want you to
[1:12:01] notice now the lowest member of the body
[1:12:06] speaking to a more exalted member
[1:12:11] of the body
[1:12:14] I want you to notice now your hand
[1:12:17] and your foot if you're normal
[1:12:19] so you've got five fingers
[1:12:22] five toes
[1:12:25] it's the only two that Paul uses that
[1:12:29] have a miniature reflection in each
[1:12:32] other
[1:12:33] five five
[1:12:36] ones and one extreme and the other is an
[1:12:39] ocean now maybe some of you all think
[1:12:40] you have pretty feet that's one thing
[1:12:43] I've yet to see
[1:12:46] now maybe I've never seen yours but
[1:12:49] you know the foot now let's let's look
[1:12:53] at the foot
[1:12:56] the lowest part of us
[1:13:00] the part
[1:13:01] that takes all the weight
[1:13:04] the part
[1:13:06] that smells
[1:13:10] the part that aches
[1:13:14] the part that bears the load day in and
[1:13:19] day out
[1:13:20] the part that most of us never let
[1:13:24] others see I say this time here tonight
[1:13:26] but sandals on I see a few but very few
[1:13:31] and yet the hand look at the hair
[1:13:35] a member of humility
[1:13:40] now I've never been a barefoot guy
[1:13:43] I'm glad I didn't live in the days of
[1:13:45] Jesus because I couldn't handle sandals
[1:13:48] I don't own a parent I wouldn't have a
[1:13:50] pair I don't care what they cost you
[1:13:51] couldn't give them to me because I ain't
[1:13:52] worried them
[1:13:54] I'm a tender foot I always have been I
[1:13:56] do good to get them go to the bathroom
[1:13:57] back to the bed at night
[1:14:01] I wear shoes God made shoes
[1:14:06] you a better friend though you want to
[1:14:07] the Bible says let your feet be shot
[1:14:10] with the preparation of the Gospel not
[1:14:12] just not with souls and sandals and all
[1:14:15] that shoes shoes
[1:14:21] and the last year and a half as you know
[1:14:23] I've been meeting with this plantar
[1:14:25] fasciitis
[1:14:28] I'm always appreciated my feet
[1:14:31] they took me a lot of places
[1:14:34] but oh how I've appreciated them in the
[1:14:37] last year and a half
[1:14:39] when they weren't hurting
[1:14:41] now for those of you that know what that
[1:14:43] is it's that plantar on the bottom of
[1:14:45] your foot which comes up like this goes
[1:14:47] up the back of the ankle a little bit
[1:14:48] and it gets stretched and strained
[1:14:52] I have got enough inner Souls
[1:14:56] sent to me from people around the world
[1:14:59] that I think I'm going to open up a shop
[1:15:04] and I thank you all for sending them
[1:15:05] because I've tried every one of them God
[1:15:07] knows it I've had shoes sent to me from
[1:15:10] Amazon from people in Canada from people
[1:15:13] in the states and I thank you for every
[1:15:15] prayer I've got alongside of what's my
[1:15:17] insert place I'm opening up a shoe place
[1:15:19] as well
[1:15:21] because people heard me talk about it
[1:15:23] and they love me and they want to try to
[1:15:26] help me get some comfort
[1:15:29] well I wonder if we couldn't learn from
[1:15:32] that
[1:15:34] so we look at our hand
[1:15:37] and it is the part that is most
[1:15:39] expressive
[1:15:41] now I suppose that I could learn to walk
[1:15:45] on my hands
[1:15:46] I might be a little bit old for that
[1:15:48] though
[1:15:50] now you think you could learn to walk on
[1:15:52] your hands
[1:15:54] some of you don't think he's some
[1:15:56] what you think it might be top heavy the
[1:15:57] other way around or something are you
[1:15:59] worried about that
[1:16:01] well people do right
[1:16:04] how many you've got these fingers which
[1:16:06] are longer than your toes
[1:16:08] I suppose you could do it
[1:16:11] but it would not be an order
[1:16:14] because God made you to stand up this
[1:16:17] way and to walk on your feet
[1:16:20] but yet the feet
[1:16:23] the feet are Saul
[1:16:26] misunderstood
[1:16:28] so abused
[1:16:31] and you don't already think that much
[1:16:32] about them
[1:16:34] unless they go to hurt me
[1:16:37] and then you baby them and you pet them
[1:16:40] oh man one brother now I I don't I don't
[1:16:43] remember but he'll remember I'm sure
[1:16:45] you'll hear you hear me because he
[1:16:46] streams us up in the Midwest
[1:16:48] and he sent an email to the library and
[1:16:50] he said tell brother Donnie I had it and
[1:16:53] I went to a podiatrist and he told me to
[1:16:54] try these inserts which I bought them
[1:16:57] and tried them but he also told me to
[1:17:00] get a foot massager
[1:17:02] and he gave me the name of it and I got
[1:17:04] it let me set this way I've got two of
[1:17:06] them
[1:17:09] because it was basically the only thing
[1:17:11] that I found that really helped me and
[1:17:13] it really did help me I used it today as
[1:17:16] a matter of fact
[1:17:17] so my feet have got more attention in
[1:17:21] the last year and a half than they have
[1:17:23] the last 67 years
[1:17:26] but the only reason they've got
[1:17:28] attention was because they were hurting
[1:17:33] some days when I was over here laying
[1:17:35] Stone and I'd leave five six seven
[1:17:37] o'clock whatever
[1:17:39] I go home I had to call Carol one day to
[1:17:41] help me get out of the truck because I
[1:17:43] couldn't get out of the truck I couldn't
[1:17:44] walk
[1:17:46] I couldn't walk I saw like this she had
[1:17:49] to help me get in the house
[1:17:51] but normally I would just jump out of
[1:17:54] the truck and walk in there and now
[1:17:57] think of sometimes
[1:17:59] the members of our assembly
[1:18:02] and the members of the mystical body
[1:18:04] that sometimes we may tend to look down
[1:18:07] on the weaker ones or ones that we saw
[1:18:09] all you know they're just big babies
[1:18:11] they need attention over this or that or
[1:18:13] the other but maybe they're going
[1:18:16] through a real hard time
[1:18:19] I don't mind telling you my feet have
[1:18:21] got more attention in the last year and
[1:18:23] a half than my hands well except for a
[1:18:26] while ago and I cut my thumb and my
[1:18:27] finger and then I needed some attention
[1:18:29] because it's pouring the blood
[1:18:31] so the Deacon had to bring me some
[1:18:33] Band-Aids
[1:18:34] but what do we do whenever we have
[1:18:37] something that's going on all of our
[1:18:40] Focus
[1:18:41] goes to that particular part so I'm
[1:18:43] standing in there and I cut my finger on
[1:18:45] the little Rim under the the sink there
[1:18:47] so I turn the water on blood pouring out
[1:18:49] everywhere got blood on the sink blood
[1:18:51] on everything
[1:18:53] so what I do I change my attention from
[1:18:56] my feet to my finger well that didn't
[1:18:59] just do it once I'm so accident prone I
[1:19:01] cut this finger and I cut this thumb so
[1:19:03] it's difficult for me
[1:19:05] so what did I do all of my attention was
[1:19:09] aimed toward what the hurt parts
[1:19:12] how many knows what I'm saying well you
[1:19:15] understand that if we're not careful we
[1:19:16] will tend to magnify the strengths oh
[1:19:19] look at this great man look at this
[1:19:21] great woman they're so strong and I said
[1:19:23] what about songs oh my oh my goodness
[1:19:25] you can't believe how babyfied they are
[1:19:27] they're just pansies they're this and
[1:19:29] that and the other well maybe they need
[1:19:31] you to help them maybe they need you oh
[1:19:34] my how long will it how long should we
[1:19:37] how long would it be your advice that I
[1:19:39] should take care of my feet
[1:19:43] should I give my feet a deadline
[1:19:45] and if you don't straighten up hey I'm
[1:19:48] sick of this you understand that Left
[1:19:50] Foot Right Foot I'm sick of this stuff
[1:19:54] I'm single wearing insoles in my shoes
[1:19:57] I'm tired of it
[1:19:59] I'm sick of sitting down on my foot
[1:20:01] massager for three and four hours at a
[1:20:03] time I'm giving you till next week
[1:20:06] and if you don't straighten up
[1:20:11] well come on help me now what should I
[1:20:13] do am I going to take them off
[1:20:15] am I gonna buy some Woodlands
[1:20:17] am I am I going to get some concrete
[1:20:19] wonder what am I going to do you know
[1:20:21] what I'm going to do the same thing you

[1:20:39] dance a little bit if you feel like it
[1:20:41] maybe shouting on the devil's head how
[1:20:43] long will you do it as long as it takes
[1:20:47] so I say if we do our feet that way our
[1:20:51] hands that way our head that way our
[1:20:53] shoulder that way I say we ought to feel
[1:20:56] that way about the body of Christ so if
[1:20:59] we've got weak members how long do we
[1:21:01] deal with them we deal with them until
[1:21:04] we are changed that's how long
[1:21:07] we don't give them six months and then
[1:21:09] we'll throw them away no we are here to
[1:21:13] lift you up we are here to help you
[1:21:18] [Applause]
[1:21:22] oh my
[1:21:27] so the lowest member of the body
[1:21:30] which contacts the Earth constantly
[1:21:33] looks up to The Honorable part and says
[1:21:37] now listen there's my foot's in it hey
[1:21:40] hand
[1:21:42] I'm not you
[1:21:43] every time he preaches he gets up there
[1:21:46] and does all this stuff and if you tie
[1:21:48] his hands he couldn't say a word he's
[1:21:50] like most pictures he couldn't say
[1:21:52] nothing if his hands is tight nobody
[1:21:54] never looks at me
[1:21:56] nobody ever even knows I'm hardly
[1:21:58] attached to his legs except they just
[1:22:00] seem walking around they don't nobody
[1:22:03] ever look at me like they look at you
[1:22:05] when he makes all these symbols and
[1:22:07] Counting and all they are you get all
[1:22:10] the attention don't you you get all the
[1:22:12] attention what do I get plantar
[1:22:15] fasciitis
[1:22:24] so because I don't get the attention
[1:22:28] I'm quitting
[1:22:32] I beg you don't give up on me now
[1:22:39] oh my goodness it sustains the whole
[1:22:43] weight of the body
[1:22:46] very best raping you look at think what
[1:22:48] a miracle our feet are
[1:22:51] outside is 10. about that long maybe
[1:22:54] something like that
[1:22:55] I want you to look at all the weight all
[1:22:57] the structure
[1:22:58] that it supports every day of my life
[1:23:03] it has done so for 67 years
[1:23:06] I ain't had to have new new feet hadn't
[1:23:08] had to replace them and had to go back
[1:23:09] and trade them in get another pair
[1:23:11] they've done this ever since I was born
[1:23:13] and I took my first step
[1:23:21] so here they move
[1:23:24] they stabilize me
[1:23:26] they support me
[1:23:28] they get no glory
[1:23:31] to be honest with you I don't remember
[1:23:32] really I don't recall how long it's been
[1:23:34] since I even thanked him for it
[1:23:38] y'all think I should
[1:23:43] I wonder if the church is not made up
[1:23:45] well really I don't have to wonder I
[1:23:47] know it is
[1:23:48] the church is made up like this
[1:23:51] in the mystical body there are people
[1:23:54] that are the support
[1:23:57] in the natural Church body there are
[1:23:59] people that are the support I'm not
[1:24:01] telling me just financially but they're
[1:24:03] there they're faithful they help
[1:24:05] stabilize everything
[1:24:07] they may never be called up here to pray
[1:24:10] because they'd be so tongue-tied and so
[1:24:12] embarrassing or tell them what they'd
[1:24:13] say
[1:24:14] they'll never want any type of Limelight
[1:24:17] they'll never want to be able to get up
[1:24:18] in front of nobody but you can depend on
[1:24:21] them when the pastor stands up and looks
[1:24:24] out they're there unless there's
[1:24:25] something bad going wrong
[1:24:27] either thy ever service they're just
[1:24:30] there oh my thank you feet
[1:24:34] thank you feet
[1:24:36] [Laughter]
[1:24:38] Hallelujah
[1:24:40] thank God for the feet that have been
[1:24:44] around the world for 2 000 years that
[1:24:47] have supported the Gospel of Jesus
[1:24:49] Christ and give it its stability
[1:24:57] oh my
[1:25:00] God so the humble
[1:25:02] speaks to the more honorable
[1:25:07] which is the closest one that resembles
[1:25:10] itself
[1:25:13] is it amazing what a contrast between
[1:25:16] the five
[1:25:18] and the five
[1:25:20] this one does not bear my weight this
[1:25:23] one does not carry the load
[1:25:26] it's the one that gets more Glory
[1:25:29] but
[1:25:30] I'm glad I don't have two feet here
[1:25:33] and two feet here
[1:25:35] that would really be bizarre right
[1:25:38] can you imagine trying to eat with a
[1:25:42] foot feeding you
[1:25:44] can you imagine how now the defeat
[1:25:47] cannot survive
[1:25:49] without the hands
[1:25:51] now remember in this it's the ministry
[1:25:55] in this is the deacons or every person
[1:25:59] that's in the body of Christ every one
[1:26:01] of you finds your identity somewhere in
[1:26:04] the spiritual parallel of the anatomy of
[1:26:07] the body of Christ
[1:26:10] so the civility of the church and those
[1:26:13] that are able to stand there and then
[1:26:15] you have the legs which are The Columns
[1:26:17] of support and then you have all of it
[1:26:19] joined together minds of great mystical
[1:26:22] Body of Christ is joined the same way so
[1:26:25] can we really say well we don't need you
[1:26:28] we don't want you we don't want you or
[1:26:31] can you say or should you even say they
[1:26:35] don't need me
[1:26:37] I'm not important you should never say
[1:26:40] that
[1:26:41] you should never let that lie come out
[1:26:43] of your mouth because that's what it is
[1:26:45] you're not supposed to lie
[1:26:48] you are needed in the body of Christ
[1:26:52] you are needed if God has made you a
[1:26:55] part of this church you are needed in
[1:26:58] this church
[1:27:02] whatever God places you
[1:27:07] now watch Paul says if the foot shall
[1:27:10] say because
[1:27:12] I am not the hand
[1:27:17] I find it amazing as brother Branham
[1:27:19] would travel around it
[1:27:21] of course he would preach and call us
[1:27:23] sins most churches was not big enough
[1:27:25] to be able to hold his crowd so they
[1:27:28] would contact different pastors say go
[1:27:30] to Phoenix and they'd contact him let
[1:27:32] him know he was coming and then them
[1:27:34] pastors would bring their people in and
[1:27:37] that's what made up the meeting
[1:27:39] and brother brought him over and over
[1:27:41] again whenever he would go to operate in
[1:27:43] the gift
[1:27:45] and then praying for the people he would
[1:27:47] call the pastors to come up
[1:27:49] and it's amazing when you go to studying
[1:27:51] this how many times he repeats this and
[1:27:53] he said now a lot of evangelists come to
[1:27:56] town and he said they want you to think
[1:27:58] they're the main one
[1:28:01] he's having these pastors right here are
[1:28:03] just as called of God to pray for the
[1:28:06] sick as I am
[1:28:07] now what's he doing
[1:28:09] a stronger one
[1:28:12] is giving the weaker looking ones their
[1:28:16] proper place in the gospel
[1:28:19] now you see this as part of the imagery
[1:28:22] of the strong to help the weak I found
[1:28:26] it I just did a search on this not long
[1:28:28] ago and it was amazing how many times
[1:28:30] over and over and over again I quoted to
[1:28:33] tell you not long ago that he said he
[1:28:34] stood at the end of a prayer line in one
[1:28:36] particular place and he put the Pastors
[1:28:38] in front in front of him and he said by
[1:28:41] the time the majority of the people got
[1:28:43] to him they were already healed
[1:28:46] why because God honored the prayers of
[1:28:49] those passions now why did he do that
[1:28:51] none of them pastors would ever be what
[1:28:54] he was he was what the eyes The Seer
[1:28:58] none of them pastors that ever did that
[1:29:00] and he said now your pastor won't do
[1:29:02] this he said because there's only one to
[1:29:05] a generation
[1:29:07] and the church said
[1:29:09] and he knew they would not do that but
[1:29:11] he wanted to give them their proper
[1:29:13] position not only the eyes of the
[1:29:16] preachers but in the eyes of the
[1:29:18] congregation you see some preachers lost
[1:29:20] to go around and project like that they
[1:29:23] are greater than all the rest of the
[1:29:25] pastors
[1:29:26] oh my that man needs an understanding
[1:29:29] himself don't
[1:29:31] but that was not the spirit this message
[1:29:33] was delivered in it was delivered in the
[1:29:36] spirit that the prophet had his position
[1:29:38] but he himself said he would not make a
[1:29:42] good pastor he was not a good pastor he
[1:29:45] said and he never would make one but he
[1:29:47] said there are those that God has called
[1:29:50] to be such so he did not do away with
[1:29:54] the pastors did not do away with the
[1:29:56] Evangelist but he placed them and then
[1:29:59] the greater gave the honor to the weaker
[1:30:03] you see every Pastor is always weaker
[1:30:06] than the prophet of the age praise the
[1:30:09] Lord absolutely and will never go up as
[1:30:12] high as he did not intended to and it's
[1:30:15] up to those who are higher elevated to
[1:30:18] be able to look to the feet and say look
[1:30:20] feet we need you you are important to us
[1:30:24] you may not have as many miracles and
[1:30:27] some preachers no doubt feel like the
[1:30:29] feet in the body of the mess
[1:30:31] they feel like nobody hardly knows them
[1:30:34] they've never preached a convention and
[1:30:36] never will and certain certain ones are
[1:30:38] the ones that preach you know all the
[1:30:40] conventions around the message but
[1:30:42] always supposed to look at these other
[1:30:44] brothers that's never invited for such
[1:30:45] and say well they don't amount anything
[1:30:47] well I'll tell you one thing I'm not
[1:30:49] going to do that because we are
[1:30:51] absolutely breaking God's word when we
[1:30:54] will take the hands and point the hands
[1:30:57] down to the feet and say you're not
[1:30:58] important oh yes they are important you
[1:31:02] sit here tonight brother sister every
[1:31:04] young person in this church is important
[1:31:06] you're important to God and you're
[1:31:09] important to us every young sister every
[1:31:12] young man every middle-aged man every
[1:31:14] elder man and woman come on church say
[1:31:17] Amen with me everyone that God gives us
[1:31:20] to be a part of this assembly you ought
[1:31:23] important to us and if God made you a
[1:31:26] part of our assembly we need you just
[1:31:29] like you need us and don't you to get
[1:31:32] discouraged and say well it's a big
[1:31:34] church they don't need me big bodies do
[1:31:36] big bodies need feet
[1:31:39] do big people need feet
[1:31:42] do skinny people need feet
[1:31:45] do middle-sized people need feet well I
[1:31:49] guess we all need feet don't we
[1:31:52] so whether you're a little church or a
[1:31:54] medium-sized church or a big church we
[1:31:57] need every member that God put us
[1:32:00] together with
[1:32:02] [Applause]
[1:32:05] oh my
[1:32:08] God oh help us Jesus
[1:32:12] because I am not the hand
[1:32:16] the instrument of communication and
[1:32:20] action
[1:32:21] that liberally imparts and nourishes the
[1:32:26] body
[1:32:27] remember the Homer Longoria says he
[1:32:31] wished God
[1:32:33] would have put his Mouse right here
[1:32:37] so when he sat down at the table he
[1:32:39] could just rake it straight in
[1:32:46] the brother Homer buddy you look really
[1:32:48] strange with your belly talking
[1:32:52] hahaha
[1:32:54] now look at the hands we have hands in
[1:32:57] the church
[1:32:58] we have hands in the ministry of the
[1:33:02] body
[1:33:03] look at all this symbolism it's
[1:33:05] absolutely awesome when you look at it
[1:33:06] right
[1:33:07] but is everybody a hand some people they
[1:33:10] could just get in there and they just go
[1:33:12] to doing things like wow I wish I could
[1:33:14] do that
[1:33:15] I wish I'd be able to do that well
[1:33:17] somebody's got to be a big toe brother
[1:33:21] well wouldn't that be some of you it's a
[1:33:23] big toe in the body
[1:33:27] I don't say right now that none of you
[1:33:29] want to be that
[1:33:30] you'd rather be the thumb right
[1:33:35] watch how your fingers were parallel to
[1:33:37] them toes
[1:33:41] and yet God made every one of us a
[1:33:45] gifted us with certain things
[1:33:48] and the worst thing we can do is sit
[1:33:50] there and compare ourselves to so-and-so
[1:33:52] they get blessed so much they shouts it
[1:33:54] like every time they go to church they
[1:33:56] worship and I just struggle and struggle
[1:33:58] and but keep on struggling
[1:34:00] keep right on pressing keep right on
[1:34:03] pressing Little Lily till you'll get up
[1:34:05] out of that old muck in that pond and
[1:34:07] you'll shine as bright as that one the
[1:34:09] shouts and screams and Hollows come on
[1:34:11] somebody you'll be able to do exactly
[1:34:14] what God wants you to do because your
[1:34:16] place in the body for a reason
[1:34:21] now watch this one does so many more
[1:34:24] works
[1:34:25] than the foot
[1:34:28] look what the hands can do the hands can
[1:34:31] break eggs my hands can you know take
[1:34:34] stuff and and work don't you just love
[1:34:36] to watch people do stuff with their
[1:34:38] hands I think it's just something about
[1:34:39] just mesmerizing well me anyway you know
[1:34:41] they just wow how do they do that you
[1:34:44] watch guys and I sit down in Arizona
[1:34:46] several years ago brother Ron Peterson
[1:34:47] this wife Carol and I and there's a guy
[1:34:49] there's an artist studio and he made
[1:34:51] these Bronze Statues and he would take
[1:34:54] and do these things in Motley clay and
[1:34:56] he was putting them together and just
[1:34:57] took a ball of something another clay
[1:34:59] and he would take this and transform it
[1:35:01] into a horse and he would take and shape
[1:35:04] the hoof now brother Ron Peterson's
[1:35:06] daddy was a jockey actually
[1:35:08] and he won the Santa Maria whatever
[1:35:10] saying and whatever it's called one of
[1:35:12] them deals out there he was a jockey so
[1:35:13] he knew Mickey Rooney and all them guys
[1:35:16] well by the Ron looked at that and he
[1:35:18] said buddy he said you mind if I tell
[1:35:20] you something about that horse he said
[1:35:21] no go ahead
[1:35:23] they said well I'm Cowboy he said my
[1:35:25] daddy was someone said oh your daddy was
[1:35:27] so-and-so yeah he said I knew about your
[1:35:29] daddy he said you've got that horse
[1:35:31] falling wrong
[1:35:32] now the horse is coming to him the rider
[1:35:34] was on his back and this guy had him
[1:35:36] falling in the wrong way he said he'll
[1:35:38] never fall that way he'll fall this land
[1:35:40] that way why won't this stand in there
[1:35:41] that God grabbed a hold of that leg of
[1:35:43] that horse and the man of his own next
[1:35:45] minute is gone
[1:35:47] so he took brother Ron's advice
[1:35:50] so brother Ron from his memory and from
[1:35:54] being around horses all of his life this
[1:35:56] guy probably never even been on the back
[1:35:57] of a pony more likely so he was just
[1:36:00] doing what he saw but he was a man who
[1:36:03] knew who knew
[1:36:07] and it totally transformed the image of
[1:36:10] that image that he was trying to make on
[1:36:12] that horse simply because a man walked
[1:36:14] in there at the right time now no doubt
[1:36:16] he would have went right on and made it
[1:36:18] and made it totally wrong and people
[1:36:20] would have paid because those things
[1:36:22] were thousands of dollars a piece when
[1:36:23] he made them and they would have said
[1:36:26] isn't that great every one of them would
[1:36:28] have been wrong and probably nobody
[1:36:29] never even noticed him unless they've
[1:36:30] been a cowboy and a cowboy to look
[1:36:32] inside that's one of the dumbest things
[1:36:34] I've ever seen in my life a horse don't
[1:36:37] follow that way that old bow-legged
[1:36:39] Cowboy walking there said what in the
[1:36:40] world he'd do them that fur I never seen
[1:36:42] nothing like out why old Joe would never
[1:36:44] fall that way and that sat here like
[1:36:46] we're not careful that's the way we are
[1:36:49] we're building this beautiful image of
[1:36:51] this and that and the other but we don't
[1:36:53] want to do what somebody else says we
[1:36:55] want to build it the way the Lord Jesus
[1:36:57] says and the Lord Jesus has got feet and
[1:37:00] legs and eyes and hands and tongues and
[1:37:03] ears he's got all that in the body and
[1:37:05] every one of them are important to him
[1:37:12] praise God
[1:37:16] notice in verse 16.
[1:37:19] under the ear
[1:37:22] shall say again something that's not
[1:37:25] going to happen
[1:37:26] if the ear shall say
[1:37:29] because I
[1:37:31] am not the eye
[1:37:35] I am not of the body
[1:37:39] it's the telephone out of the body
[1:37:43] well you say brother Tony that's crazy I
[1:37:46] know it is
[1:37:47] just as crazy for some of us to say what
[1:37:50] we say
[1:37:53] well I'll never be a big Diss and a
[1:37:55] great big doubt and I'll never I don't
[1:37:57] guess I'm really important uh-huh so
[1:37:59] your ear
[1:38:00] just talk to your eye
[1:38:08] so the ear oh don't you love your ears I
[1:38:12] mean not necessarily maybe the shape of
[1:38:15] ears are funny I mean people's ears
[1:38:18] everybody's ears you so you ever notice
[1:38:19] people's ears I'm not let me not getting
[1:38:21] that
[1:38:23] people have different shapes
[1:38:25] some are long some tilt backwards Little
[1:38:28] Joe for any one of the reasons he
[1:38:30] carries this microphone around because
[1:38:31] you can't keep on these on his ears
[1:38:34] because the way his ears slant back
[1:38:37] you can't already make one of them fit
[1:38:38] so it just gets in a big strength and
[1:38:40] drops something right down there and
[1:38:41] forget the ears
[1:38:43] so everybody's ears is not exactly the
[1:38:47] same but yet if they're normal and they
[1:38:50] function properly what a blessing they
[1:38:52] are
[1:38:53] well where would we be tonight if we
[1:38:56] didn't have ears
[1:38:58] we wouldn't be able to enjoy the birds
[1:39:00] women be able to enjoy singing we
[1:39:02] wouldn't be able to enjoy music only
[1:39:04] feel the vibration as you come into our
[1:39:06] body how much we would miss by the ear
[1:39:09] but if the ear got this mentality well I
[1:39:12] can't read
[1:39:15] and I thought I couldn't read
[1:39:20] the ear is not supposed to read
[1:39:26] all right some of y'all looking at me
[1:39:28] funny
[1:39:29] I'm gonna let my ear read this next
[1:39:30] scripture
[1:39:36] well come on now you said you wasn't the
[1:39:38] eye you wanted to be like the eye so go
[1:39:40] ahead
[1:39:45] makes just as much sense for somebody
[1:39:47] that you're trying to take somebody
[1:39:48] else's place in the body
[1:39:57] but whether they're big
[1:39:58] pointed flat round fat whatever they are
[1:40:04] where would you be in your life
[1:40:07] without them
[1:40:09] some of you that's getting older
[1:40:13] you know how it is
[1:40:16] what
[1:40:18] what'd you say
[1:40:22] of course one of the first things you
[1:40:23] should start making excuses that's
[1:40:24] thinking heater so loud I can't hear
[1:40:26] nothing
[1:40:27] well the engine the traffic is so loud
[1:40:29] out there okay here's nothing no more go
[1:40:31] ahead and admit it buddy you're getting
[1:40:33] old
[1:40:35] Lord God children it's one thing to lose
[1:40:37] your hearing sense of hearing naturally
[1:40:39] what's even worse than that
[1:40:41] it's when people become dull of hearing
[1:40:44] spiritually
[1:40:45] and you try to tell them what the word
[1:40:47] says and tell them what the message said
[1:40:48] what what okay here you can't hear you
[1:40:51] may always be able to hear the voice of
[1:40:53] God
[1:40:58] and if the ear shall say because
[1:41:01] I'm not the eye
[1:41:04] the organ that receives the sounds
[1:41:08] what a tremendous saying the eardrum is
[1:41:10] remember the Little Stirrup you saw it
[1:41:12] like whenever you went to school and
[1:41:14] they showed you all them little Parts on
[1:41:15] the inside it's incredible isn't it how
[1:41:18] those those vibrations can come in there
[1:41:20] and hit that ear and it just absolutely
[1:41:23] incredible what God made and yet be able
[1:41:26] to hear it
[1:41:27] and your eye been able to look and sing
[1:41:29] and sing it upside down and turning it
[1:41:31] back where it's supposed to be totally
[1:41:33] incredible how God made us the greatest
[1:41:35] cameras they've ever made and still
[1:41:38] haven't made one equivalent to the human
[1:41:41] eye
[1:41:42] because the DPI how the eye can
[1:41:45] differentiate between the colors how the
[1:41:47] eye can get the clarity how the eye can
[1:41:49] do all of that and science try to make
[1:41:50] cameras and other cameras and James
[1:41:52] Webb's telescope and all that and my
[1:41:54] little eye can beat him
[1:41:56] they spend billions of dollars sending
[1:41:58] it out there to take pictures and God
[1:42:00] stuck one inside of your head that's
[1:42:02] better than anything they've ever come
[1:42:03] up with
[1:42:04] what a great thing God made and we need
[1:42:07] eyes in the body people I don't need a
[1:42:10] pasture but you do you need a man on the
[1:42:12] Watchtower to say watch out the devil's
[1:42:14] coming watch out watch out be careful
[1:42:16] watch out people say oh I don't need
[1:42:18] nothing I'm down inside the walls yes
[1:42:20] you do God puts a man in the Watchtower
[1:42:22] and he's listening and he's hearing and
[1:42:25] he's watching and he's seeing and say
[1:42:27] wait a minute there's a dark time coming
[1:42:29] everybody make ready get ready we're
[1:42:31] fixing to leave this world
[1:42:36] oh my
[1:42:40] God so the ears say to the eye
[1:42:43] I don't have the ability to see
[1:42:47] I guess there's no name even go back
[1:42:50] nobody needs me
[1:42:53] yeah we did
[1:42:55] yeah we do
[1:42:58] let me tell you I have a special
[1:42:59] admiration friends
[1:43:02] we're brothers in this message many of
[1:43:04] them have stood and preached to 20 and
[1:43:05] 30.
[1:43:06] for years of their life
[1:43:09] to stand before a Congregation of
[1:43:11] several hundred
[1:43:12] they'll never bail out to do it
[1:43:15] and if we're not careful we'll tend to
[1:43:17] look down so well I guess God couldn't
[1:43:18] trust them as much I guess they're not
[1:43:20] very trustworthy
[1:43:23] I admire those men
[1:43:28] don't you brother Darryl
[1:43:31] brother Daryl travels
[1:43:33] sometimes 12 and 14 hours
[1:43:36] flying or driving
[1:43:39] to preach to ten
[1:43:41] 15.
[1:43:43] 20.
[1:43:46] of course you know brother there
[1:43:47] whenever he gets her when the crowd was
[1:43:49] real small of course he just stands
[1:43:51] there and reserves his energy and
[1:43:52] doesn't say very much because there's
[1:43:54] not very many
[1:43:58] no
[1:44:00] he preaches with all of his might
[1:44:04] well brother Downs never got to preach
[1:44:06] the convention over Ruth
[1:44:09] brother Dales never got to preach a
[1:44:11] convention in South Africa
[1:44:14] he's never got to preach the thousands
[1:44:16] at one time
[1:44:17] so some people look at brother Daryl
[1:44:20] they kind of looked down at him
[1:44:26] I'll tell you one thing they're going to
[1:44:27] have a hard time
[1:44:29] send before the Lord one day
[1:44:32] because they measure Everybody by
[1:44:34] themselves
[1:44:38] when thousands times thousands of people
[1:44:40] will walk up and stand with brother
[1:44:42] Daryl that got saved Sanctified filled
[1:44:45] with the Holy Ghost heals miracles signs
[1:44:49] wonders all kinds of things come on
[1:44:52] Church oh you don't hear him talking
[1:44:54] about it much I've been trying to
[1:44:55] encourage him to share more things with
[1:44:57] you because I want you to know how God
[1:44:59] is moving among us and you're looking
[1:45:01] for a great evangelist or a great this
[1:45:04] or that or the other open your eyes we
[1:45:07] have them
[1:45:08] I said open your eyes we have them
[1:45:10] they're in our ranks they're in our
[1:45:13] midst we don't need television preachers
[1:45:16] to tell us about God we don't need to
[1:45:19] reach outside the message to get into
[1:45:21] the direct contact of God we've got it
[1:45:24] we've got it but sometimes we don't see
[1:45:27] it because of what we identify great is
[1:45:32] oh my
[1:45:35] God it's amazing how each one of these
[1:45:37] that Paul uses when he shows this
[1:45:39] parallel
[1:45:41] and it says if the Earth shall say
[1:45:43] because I'm not the eye I am not the
[1:45:45] body now he makes the statement then he
[1:45:47] asks the question
[1:45:49] is it therefore not of the body
[1:45:53] verse 17 if the whole body were an eye
[1:45:57] let's say something always looking at me
[1:45:58] funny there a while ago whenever I took
[1:46:00] one of them individuals made it but I
[1:46:02] got that from the Bible
[1:46:03] wouldn't it look weird to have a six
[1:46:06] foot eyeball
[1:46:08] standing up here
[1:46:12] one great big apple
[1:46:15] I said that's spooky brother Donnie yeah
[1:46:17] it is spooky and that's what people try
[1:46:20] to do to the ministry they want to take
[1:46:22] one aspect of the minister they want to
[1:46:24] take the prophets aspect of the ministry
[1:46:27] which is the eye and say that's all you
[1:46:29] need
[1:46:31] well come on now oh yeah that's what the
[1:46:33] tape only people do that's what they
[1:46:35] want they want the eye only that's all
[1:46:37] they want they don't want nothing else
[1:46:39] but the eye but you don't have a body
[1:46:42] without having all of it put together so
[1:46:46] it's the same thing well brother Don is
[1:46:47] my favorite preacher and if he ain't
[1:46:49] preaching I just ain't going I believe
[1:46:50] I've got a slight headache that might be
[1:46:52] the best time for you to go brother I
[1:46:54] might be preaching every day
[1:46:55] [Music]
[1:46:58] you see Satan wants to hone us into one
[1:47:01] preacher and then all he's got to do is
[1:47:04] bring something between you and that one
[1:47:06] and you no longer believe in Preachers
[1:47:08] at all
[1:47:10] oh somebody preach when they deny you
[1:47:13] see thank God for the eyes thank God for
[1:47:16] the lips thank God for the ears thank
[1:47:18] God for the hands thank God for the feet
[1:47:21] praise the Lord Church
[1:47:23] do we need them all
[1:47:26] are you glad we've got them all not only
[1:47:28] natural but in the spiritual body
[1:47:31] let me find a place to close
[1:47:34] if the whole body were an eye
[1:47:37] where were the hearing
[1:47:39] if the whole body were hearing
[1:47:43] where
[1:47:44] the smelling
[1:47:46] a bless the heart some people that's all
[1:47:49] they have is a big eye
[1:47:51] except it's not e-y-e
[1:47:58] you got it
[1:48:01] what if the church consisted only of the
[1:48:05] imminent lightbringers which are
[1:48:07] preachers
[1:48:09] so what if the church consisted only of
[1:48:11] preachers no Leia tell loud
[1:48:14] so you don't preach on preacher level
[1:48:17] and talk on preacher level because
[1:48:19] preachers study on a different level
[1:48:20] than led to them and they talk different
[1:48:24] so where would be the laity that would
[1:48:26] live it
[1:48:28] so if it was all laity and no preacher
[1:48:33] don't you see it makes no sense
[1:48:35] so what do we need every one of them
[1:48:38] that God put in the body
[1:48:44] Wendy
[1:48:46] organ players
[1:48:49] piano players
[1:48:53] guitar players y'all really needed one
[1:48:55] of them right now
[1:48:56] you need bass guitar players and we need
[1:48:59] all of this but everybody
[1:49:02] who's so talented
[1:49:04] can't be on the platform at the same
[1:49:06] time
[1:49:09] so it's hard sometimes
[1:49:12] to play second fiddle
[1:49:17] there's been more people leave the
[1:49:19] church church is I should say
[1:49:22] over that fact right there than probably
[1:49:24] you'd want to know
[1:49:26] because they don't get to play enough
[1:49:28] so they go somewhere else
[1:49:30] I thought we went to church what was was
[1:49:33] fed the most
[1:49:34] oh where'd I got that at I mean I just
[1:49:36] listened to tapes and stuff like that so
[1:49:38] I'm
[1:49:41] used more over here I'm used more of an
[1:49:44] eye I can be uh
[1:49:49] and I thought we went to church where we
[1:49:50] get fed the most
[1:49:54] [Applause]
[1:49:56] well everybody know
[1:49:57] but God has set the members
[1:50:00] every one of them in the body
[1:50:03] in the way that it pleased everybody
[1:50:05] that was in the body
[1:50:07] because God didn't want to make nobody
[1:50:09] mad or in us and so God
[1:50:15] see free whenever we question where we
[1:50:19] are and what we are
[1:50:21] heart we're questioning
[1:50:24] him
[1:50:28] so if he made you a foot
[1:50:31] and you've got an issue
[1:50:33] with being afoot
[1:50:36] you don't have a problem with me
[1:50:38] you don't have a problem with the eyes
[1:50:39] or the ears or the hands
[1:50:42] you have a problem
[1:50:44] with him who puts you there
[1:50:52] because you're thinking
[1:50:53] I know I could be there I'm
[1:50:57] so somehow I could be able to take this
[1:51:04] and stick it there
[1:51:07] I can't take my foot now let me take my
[1:51:12] what y'all saying
[1:51:15] you don't like it
[1:51:17] what if I did this
[1:51:32] now you're laughing
[1:51:34] but I wonder how many of us
[1:51:36] have tried to do the same thing with
[1:51:38] ourself
[1:51:42] I'm sick and tired I'll be in a foot
[1:51:55] and if God Made You
[1:51:59] the little toe
[1:52:03] this little pig went to the market
[1:52:06] so the pig stayed home
[1:52:10] but if God puts you on there
[1:52:17] and you're important to us
[1:52:19] and I hope after this service tonight
[1:52:20] will be more important to each other
[1:52:22] than we've ever met
[1:52:25] and if we see something dropping along
[1:52:27] the Wayside and we see some getting
[1:52:29] discouraged with us owl that I'm wrong
[1:52:31] let them let them drop off the side no
[1:52:34] no
[1:52:36] we pray we reach out
[1:52:39] who knows how many more God's got out
[1:52:41] here that needs to be saved
[1:52:44] needs to be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:52:45] the last one might be sitting on a bar
[1:52:48] stool tonight in Johnson City and their
[1:52:50] name is on the book what if it's the
[1:52:52] last one that'll ever be in and make the
[1:52:53] bride and when that one man or woman
[1:52:55] comes in they get filled with the Holy
[1:52:57] Ghost they might walk back down the back
[1:52:58] and it might be a woman dressed so
[1:53:00] ungodly that us men couldn't even look
[1:53:02] her way her hair may cut off like she
[1:53:04] may have lipstick on it may look
[1:53:06] absolutely terrible but down inside of
[1:53:08] her heart might be a seed of God we
[1:53:10] might not even want to get our hands
[1:53:12] dirty to lay hands on her but I'll tell
[1:53:14] you brother if God can get a hold of her
[1:53:16] and transform her won't it be wonderful
[1:53:18] if God can get a hold of a man and he
[1:53:21] smells like alcohol and marijuana and
[1:53:23] everything else but down inside of their
[1:53:25] laying a seed of God and we may look at
[1:53:27] him say plural saying probably just a
[1:53:29] serpent seat Well I don't have that
[1:53:31] microscope that you have I'm going to
[1:53:33] treat him as a potential bride member
[1:53:35] I'm going to treat them come on now I
[1:53:37] think we ought to treat the people out
[1:53:39] here it's a potential seed of God
[1:53:40] because we don't know if they are if
[1:53:42] they ain't but if we think that every
[1:53:44] everybody we run into is lost and not
[1:53:46] saved more than likely we're not going
[1:53:48] to try to reach out to them we won't
[1:53:50] even be kind to him we won't even
[1:53:52] explain a little bit of the love of God
[1:53:54] but if we'd say you know what that might
[1:53:56] be a seed that might be a germatized
[1:53:58] seed of God even if it ain't to see the
[1:54:00] god it might be a foolish virgin you
[1:54:02] might be the one that will lead them to
[1:54:04] the Lord they may not go in the Rapture
[1:54:06] but you'll stand there and be identified
[1:54:08] with them through eternity the prophet
[1:54:10] said somebody that you lead to Christ
[1:54:12] their name will be identified with you
[1:54:15] forever
[1:54:17] forever they'll be identified with you
[1:54:23] all you feet ears eyes nose mouth
[1:54:27] kidneys gallbladder livers blood cells
[1:54:31] whatever else you are
[1:54:32] stand to your feet
[1:54:52] praise the Lord
[1:54:55] and if they were all one member
[1:54:58] where or the body
[1:55:01] but now are they many members yet
[1:55:05] one body
[1:55:08] as I said before it's not just my
[1:55:10] responsibility or the responsibility of
[1:55:12] the Deacons
[1:55:14] to just watch out for one another
[1:55:16] and if you notice somebody's not been to
[1:55:18] church for a few Services text them call
[1:55:20] them hey
[1:55:22] missing you in the house of God
[1:55:24] you okay
[1:55:25] you're going through a trial you're
[1:55:26] going through something
[1:55:28] just want to let you know you're loved
[1:55:31] is there anything that I can do to help
[1:55:33] you
[1:55:36] don't you love him
[1:55:38] you love him
[1:55:40] if we love him right
[1:55:43] we'll love his members
[1:55:46] now let's be honest and Frank tonight
[1:55:47] there's people in our church and people
[1:55:49] in other churches that you will never be
[1:55:52] best buddies with
[1:55:54] because we Clash
[1:55:57] our human nature clashes and our human
[1:56:00] makeup
[1:56:01] but the prophet said maybe there's a
[1:56:03] certain brother you know there's just
[1:56:04] something about him you just don't want
[1:56:05] to be around him but he said if you hear
[1:56:08] something happens to that man
[1:56:11] your heart breaks
[1:56:13] why the love of God binds you together
[1:56:16] for your human makeup might Clash but
[1:56:19] the new birth ties you to one family one
[1:56:23] economy one purpose
[1:56:25] and that's the body of Christ
[1:56:28] I'm glad we're part of the body here
[1:56:30] aren't you
[1:56:31] but we aren't the only parts
[1:56:33] there's Parts all over this world
[1:56:36] I'm just glad we're a little part
[1:56:39] the spirit together
[1:56:44] before we offer a word of prayer I
[1:56:46] wonder
[1:56:48] men women boys girls
[1:56:51] each of you
[1:56:53] you say Lord
[1:56:55] I want to be a better member of this
[1:56:57] church I want to be a better member of
[1:56:58] your body
[1:57:00] I want to be mindful more mindful
[1:57:02] of my brothers and sisters maybe I've
[1:57:04] overlooked some of the feet here at the
[1:57:06] church
[1:57:07] some of the legs The Columns the
[1:57:09] strength
[1:57:10] maybe some Lord I've thought you know
[1:57:12] what they're so weak thou to just grow
[1:57:14] up
[1:57:16] but maybe they need help maybe they need
[1:57:18] to to help them through that plantar
[1:57:21] fasciitis
[1:57:22] or a time of weakness or stress or
[1:57:25] whatever it is let's not get rid of them
[1:57:29] let's not throw them out
[1:57:32] praise the Lord
[1:57:36] Lord I pray tonight that should begin
[1:57:38] with me
[1:57:41] dear Jesus if there's one of yours
[1:57:44] that I have ever treated wrong
[1:57:47] there's one of yours that I've ever been
[1:57:49] impatient with Lord
[1:57:52] I pray and forgive me
[1:57:54] Lord if there's one of yours whether it
[1:57:56] be a man woman boy a girl preacher or
[1:57:58] whatever it would be
[1:58:00] Lord that I haven't taken the proper
[1:58:03] attitude
[1:58:04] or the proper amount of time
[1:58:07] Forgive Me Lord
[1:58:10] I pray you'd search our hearts tonight
[1:58:12] all across this building Lord and those
[1:58:15] that are streaming the service
[1:58:19] Lord Jesus may we walk out of here with
[1:58:21] a different view about one another in a
[1:58:24] different view about ourselves maybe
[1:58:25] some
[1:58:27] are struggling with feeling
[1:58:29] that they're apart
[1:58:32] trying to find compatibility
[1:58:35] maybe they're looking for friends in the
[1:58:37] church and trying to find ones that they
[1:58:39] can buddy up with us would say
[1:58:42] and we know that's not just young people
[1:58:44] but that can be older people as well
[1:58:47] Lord I pray that you would help us
[1:58:50] to be able to realize that in order to
[1:58:53] function properly
[1:58:55] we need everybody that you've sent here
[1:58:57] Lord
[1:58:58] and that's all we want
[1:59:00] I've never pulled on people I have never
[1:59:03] done it all the years that I preached
[1:59:06] and I'm not going to start doing it now
[1:59:09] I want everybody here that you want here
[1:59:12] I want every sheep that you've ordained
[1:59:15] to be in my pastor
[1:59:17] but I ain't looking for nobody else's
[1:59:19] sheep
[1:59:20] because I refuse to be a sheep stealing
[1:59:22] preacher
[1:59:25] I don't
[1:59:27] I don't go around traveling around
[1:59:29] trying to pull on people
[1:59:31] or trying to
[1:59:33] make our church larger
[1:59:36] by doing such
[1:59:39] but Lord I do want everyone that you
[1:59:41] want
[1:59:42] so I pray you would help us father that
[1:59:45] we can do our part
[1:59:47] Lord may we
[1:59:48] the next time the Devil comes to us and
[1:59:51] well I don't know if I'm a part or not I
[1:59:54] don't know nobody even knows this nobody
[1:59:56] Lord may we may we come back to this
[1:59:59] service tonight
[2:00:01] I'm not like brother someone's on I'm
[2:00:02] not like sister so-and-so nobody ever
[2:00:04] even calls my name I never get no
[2:00:06] recognition help us to realize we're
[2:00:09] like the talking foot
[2:00:11] the talking ear
[2:00:13] the talking ah
[2:00:16] Lord God we need to know where we belong
[2:00:18] we need to know
[2:00:20] we're in Christ Jesus
[2:00:22] it was you who called us not a man
[2:00:25] it was you who called us not a preacher
[2:00:29] it was you who beckoned on our souls not
[2:00:32] Mom or daddy
[2:00:34] but the spirit of God
[2:00:36] you're the one who's placed Us in the
[2:00:38] body
[2:00:39] and then we cannot be run off
[2:00:42] that's the kind of Christians I want
[2:00:44] here Lord
[2:00:45] those that the word of God will not run
[2:00:48] off as we go on in time I realize more
[2:00:51] and more we've had a bunch of people
[2:00:53] sitting in our church and in message
[2:00:54] churches around the world that really
[2:00:57] don't believe this message
[2:01:00] they believe Parts bits and pieces but
[2:01:04] they do not believe this message
[2:01:07] Lord God I pray we won't turn out that
[2:01:10] way
[2:01:11] I pray you would give us an ear to hear
[2:01:13] give us hands to work the works of God
[2:01:17] give us feet Lord that can be shot with
[2:01:19] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[2:01:22] oh Lord may we be everything you've
[2:01:25] ordained us to be father that we can
[2:01:28] serve you and serve your people and
[2:01:31] serve the body Lord
[2:01:33] for we are called for this purpose
[2:01:36] Hallelujah we worship you tonight Lord
[2:01:40] oh Jesus May ever man woman boy and girl
[2:01:44] may they realize tonight
[2:01:46] they have a place a place and no one can
[2:01:50] take it a position and no one else can
[2:01:54] fill it
[2:01:55] and lord they're called to a post of
[2:01:57] Duty
[2:01:59] and if they're not at their post of Duty
[2:02:01] and a war breaks out
[2:02:03] what happens
[2:02:05] someone gets injured someone gets killed
[2:02:08] Lord they know how it is in the military
[2:02:10] if you're assigned to a certain post and
[2:02:14] you're not there and the enemy sees
[2:02:15] you're not there and the enemy uses that
[2:02:18] as a weak spot and comes in
[2:02:21] then they catch them people they're
[2:02:23] supposed to been on that post and they
[2:02:24] court-martial them
[2:02:26] some of them they send to prison and the
[2:02:28] Civil War days they shot them
[2:02:31] because they left their post of Duty
[2:02:34] so it's an important thing Lord to be
[2:02:36] where you've placed us
[2:02:39] we're not Church Hoppers that we go here
[2:02:42] and there and jump over here and jump
[2:02:44] over there
[2:02:45] we want to be at our post father
[2:02:49] because it ain't just a preacher
[2:02:50] depending on them it may be that person
[2:02:53] sitting around them that person sitting
[2:02:55] behind them that person sitting near him
[2:02:59] oh Jesus may we realize each of us have
[2:03:02] a responsibility
[2:03:03] and we're going to answer to you
[2:03:06] for that responsibility
[2:03:09] Lord help help the Word of Life Church
[2:03:11] to know
[2:03:12] I'm not the one who holds this place
[2:03:14] together
[2:03:16] it's not the deacons it's not the other
[2:03:18] ministers that are here it's all of us
[2:03:21] help every lay member to realize they
[2:03:23] have an awesome responsibility
[2:03:26] in this church
[2:03:27] the pastor's wife the deacons wives all
[2:03:32] these sisters all these brothers every
[2:03:34] young person
[2:03:35] no one can take their place
[2:03:39] oh thank you Father
[2:03:41] thank you Father
[2:03:44] We Worship You Lord
[2:03:47] can we just raise our hands
[2:03:52] once again now notice what you're
[2:03:55] raising not your feet
[2:03:57] your hands
[2:03:59] so say the Bible tells you they don't
[2:04:02] tell you to raise your feet
[2:04:04] but lifting up holy hands it never says
[2:04:08] that about the feet
[2:04:10] and then amazing even in the scriptures
[2:04:12] and you go to looking at it the glory
[2:04:14] that's given to the hands but look at
[2:04:17] the shame that is brought upon the hands
[2:04:20] if the hands are well
[2:04:22] and they don't go up
[2:04:25] so how many of you have to be begged
[2:04:27] to raise your hands
[2:04:30] so then that thing which should be an
[2:04:32] instrument of Honor then turns in to a
[2:04:36] reproach
[2:04:37] because you won't lift them in the
[2:04:40] presence of God Amen
[2:04:42] amen all my as long as I've got them and
[2:04:44] I've got strength in my arms I want to
[2:04:46] lift them up I know y'all think I'm
[2:04:47] crazy anyhow but let me just tell you I
[2:04:50] worship the Lord at home
[2:04:52] I worship the Lord man I'm down in the
[2:04:54] basement I worship the Lord whenever I'm
[2:04:56] driving down the road I raise my hands
[2:04:59] it's a common thing to me I do it every
[2:05:02] day of my life I pray every day I
[2:05:04] worship him every day I talk to him
[2:05:06] every day I love him every day I've got
[2:05:08] to walk with him every day mine ain't
[2:05:10] twice a week so it ain't unusual for me
[2:05:13] to worship Him you say you sure do
[2:05:14] worship him a lot I'm only doing here
[2:05:16] what I do every day of my life I worship
[2:05:19] him every day I I don't have that kind
[2:05:21] of religion where I only worship Him in
[2:05:24] church I worship him everywhere I love
[2:05:26] him don't you I love him someone obey
[2:05:31] his word again tonight
[2:05:32] I want to lift up these hands think some
[2:05:34] of you used to hold cigarettes between
[2:05:36] them fingers you used to hold a bottle
[2:05:38] of whiskey or wine or alcohol or
[2:05:40] something like that in them hands but
[2:05:42] tonight
[2:05:43] they're called holy hands
[2:05:46] and you can raise them up in the
[2:05:48] presence of God
[2:05:49] and say Lord I love you with your mouse
[2:05:51] take your body now
[2:05:54] take your body
[2:05:55] your feet standing in there supporting
[2:05:57] you your legs your Columns of stability
[2:06:00] while you're standing and your hands
[2:06:03] appear the top part receiving the honor
[2:06:06] raising your hands up before the
[2:06:08] presence of the Lord
[2:06:09] but don't send our mute now but tell
[2:06:12] them how you love it so what are you
[2:06:14] doing you're using all these different
[2:06:16] parts of your body to worship god well
[2:06:19] see that's the way God wants the church
[2:06:20] to be so God wants Harry to sing yeah
[2:06:23] God wants Harry to sing he wants Brother
[2:06:25] Lou what he's saying these young people
[2:06:27] that God appearance son-in while ago
[2:06:28] didn't they do a great job but God don't
[2:06:30] just want them to sing some of you might
[2:06:32] not be special singers but you can still
[2:06:34] make a Joyful Noise to the Lord with all
[2:06:36] of your heart
[2:06:37] if a whale can sing certainly by the
[2:06:39] Charles you can if a bird can be able to
[2:06:42] sing and some of them may not be able to
[2:06:43] sing very good either I don't understand
[2:06:44] bird songs I don't know if they're on
[2:06:46] key or not but they sing with all their
[2:06:48] little hearts and they Worship the Lord
[2:06:50] so what they do they take what God gave
[2:06:52] them
[2:06:53] so let's take our feet let them
[2:06:55] stabilize our body Let The Columns of
[2:06:57] our stability our legs hold us up our
[2:07:00] torso what will we do and then we'll use
[2:07:03] our brain our intelligence and we will
[2:07:05] tell the rest of our body I want you to
[2:07:06] raise your hand so so what goes up it
[2:07:08] goes up well they can't do them without
[2:07:10] the brain it can't do that without the
[2:07:12] cerebral policy or the system going up
[2:07:14] through the spine there up to the nurse
[2:07:16] sending the message out comes right out
[2:07:18] then your optic nerve says I and it
[2:07:19] comes out Lord Jesus I love you I love

[2:07:34] and you're not here sometimes you want
[2:07:36] to stand there with your eyes open and
[2:07:37] then other times for whatever reason you
[2:07:39] just want to close your eyes so another
[2:07:41] part of your body will send a message to
[2:07:43] your eyes close your eyes so just on the
[2:07:46] call oh Jesus I love you
[2:07:49] I love you Lord I worship you oh Jesus
[2:07:52] and then someone say oh yes so just help
