[50:51] into the Earth that kill them before
[50:55] they have have a chance to even live how
[50:58] grateful we are Lord for parents that

[51:43] [Applause]
[51:50] amen I'm not sure what it is about my
[51:53] face but every everywhere that Carol and
[51:56] I go that happened to me several times
[51:58] this week kids just stare at
[52:02] me I told her the day I said am I that
[52:07] ugly she said well I think it's the
[52:10] presence of God they sense I hope that's
[52:13] what it is may we stand
[52:19] together oh I'm so happy to be in church
[52:23] today isn't it a privilege for us to be
[52:25] gathered together once again in the
[52:27] house of God
[52:28] and to know where we're living in the
[52:31] hour that's upon us and Jesus and his
[52:34] Mercy has given us
[52:37] light let's read today in 1 John
[52:42] 2:5 but who so keepeth his word in him
[52:46] verily is the love of God
[52:49] perfected hereby we know that we are in
[52:54] him
[52:56] now what you notice it's not enough to
[52:58] be able to know his word or to be able
[53:00] to even quote the word but John says
[53:04] it's who so keepeth his word so we don't
[53:08] want to just know it and it's much
[53:11] easier to get the truth than it is the
[53:14] spirit of Truth somebody might give you
[53:16] a Bible give you a book a message book
[53:19] or a tape and you say well I've got the
[53:20] truth this is the truth but the harder
[53:24] part will be getting the Spirit of Truth
[53:26] within your soul just as someone gave
[53:29] you that truth someone else might come
[53:31] and take it away but if you never get
[53:33] the spirit of Truth in you that's yours
[53:36] forever 1 John 4:12 no man hath seen God
[53:41] at any time if we love one another God
[53:47] dwelleth in us and his love is perfected
[53:53] in US verse verse
[53:56] 16 and we have known and believed the
[54:00] love that God ha to us God is
[54:04] love he that dwelleth in love dwelleth
[54:09] in God and notice don't just have love
[54:12] but you actually dwell love agapo is
[54:16] your dwelling place it's where you live
[54:20] it's where you stay so you don't move in
[54:22] and out you love you hate you love you
[54:24] hate you fuss you squabble you argue you
[54:26] fight no but you actually dwell in love
[54:32] and the word dwelleth means abide remain
[54:34] continue to remain not to depart to
[54:38] continue to be present not to become
[54:43] another or different he that dwelleth in
[54:47] God notes rather dwelleth in love
[54:49] dwelleth in God and God in him May the
[54:55] Lord bless his word you may be
[55:06] seated we certainly believe in signs and
[55:11] manifestations all kinds of miraculous
[55:13] things that we've seen our Lord do
[55:15] several people healed right here
[55:17] Wednesday
[55:18] night several people were caught up into
[55:22] the presence of God and couldn't even
[55:24] speak speak their English language no
[55:26] more I mean they were weren't
[55:28] interrupting in the service or anything
[55:29] like that but just in praising and
[55:32] praying and worshiping and we believe in
[55:35] that but yet we also know all of those
[55:38] things can be
[55:39] impersonated and we know that a person
[55:42] could actually speak in tongues and
[55:43] maybe be at order the wrong time or at
[55:47] the wrong U opportunity and they feel it
[55:50] pulsating them so much and they just do
[55:52] it and totally miss the will of God
[55:55] tongues will cease prophecies will fail
[55:58] one day there'll be no need of healing
[56:00] no need of Miracles is that right but
[56:03] yet love eternal love will always exist
[56:09] in heaven there'll be no more preaching
[56:11] there'll be no more prayer lines
[56:13] there'll be no more ministering to the
[56:15] sick but we will dwell in love this is
[56:21] part of our rights as the Bill of Rights
[56:23] that we've been looking at for a while
[56:25] for the elect of God to be able not only
[56:28] to love but to have Divine love now
[56:32] realize it can be something that many
[56:34] people think to have and yet whenever
[56:38] they're really tried it proves that they
[56:40] don't you see this type of Love is
[56:42] unnatural to every one of us there's not
[56:45] a person here today or one that's ever
[56:46] lived on the face of the Earth outside
[56:48] of the Lord Jesus that could love with
[56:51] Divine love and it come as a natural
[56:54] trait it's not natural to us all of our
[56:58] loves are filled with an element of
[57:01] selfishness even after we become
[57:03] Christians children of God there's still
[57:06] an element about the Avenue that we love
[57:10] that is still selfish so we can go to
[57:13] church and we can love to go to church
[57:15] but we can still get selfishness in that
[57:17] we can love to pray and love to sing and
[57:21] even doing things for the Lord can have
[57:24] an element of selfishness in it and it
[57:26] takes Divine love to help us to be able
[57:29] to die to that now watch the prophet
[57:32] says it this way whether in tongues it
[57:34] shall cease whether it's prophecy it
[57:36] shall vanish whether it's knowledge it
[57:37] shall vanish of all these things or even
[57:40] Gifts of Miracles of healing they shall
[57:42] all be done away with only that Divine
[57:46] love shall last now when will they be
[57:49] done away with well whenever we don't
[57:51] need them no more but as of right now we
[57:53] still need them we still need healing we
[57:56] still need Miracles we still need these
[57:57] things standing in the Gap he says now
[58:00] in the Divine love divine love how can
[58:02] that be divine love if it isn't the Holy
[58:05] Spirit the holy spirit is divine love so
[58:09] this is the only Avenue that you and I
[58:11] can have access into this great thing of
[58:14] divine love when a person first becomes
[58:16] a Christian are they baptized into
[58:18] Divine love NOP they're not they get a
[58:20] portion of the spirit of God but this
[58:23] type of Love is only a mained once
[58:25] you've grown and grown into the complete
[58:28] stages of God and it's allowed to grow
[58:31] in you Christ The Mystery of God
[58:33] revealed he says now you got tapes on
[58:34] that you got tapes on what we believe
[58:37] and you got tapes on the discipline the
[58:39] church how we behave oursel and the
[58:41] Church of God how we ought to come here
[58:44] together and sit together in Heavenly
[58:46] places don't stay home if God is in your
[58:49] heart you can't hardly wait for them
[58:53] doors to open out Young under can
[58:55] anybody say Amen to that to get in here
[58:57] to fellowship with your brothers you see
[59:00] we don't just come to church just to be
[59:02] able to fellowship with God we do and
[59:05] there's nothing like his presence but we
[59:07] come also to be with one another so they
[59:10] can minister to us and so we can in turn
[59:14] Minister back to them because there's
[59:16] something about the body that the body
[59:19] is so designed to be able to help one
[59:22] another now say for instance this way if
[59:25] you get an itch on this side of your arm
[59:28] right here now wouldn't it be absolutely
[59:31] awful if you limited yourself though to
[59:35] scratching only with your right hand now
[59:39] that would be real good as long as your
[59:41] right hand could reach everything else
[59:44] but if you limit yourself to scratching
[59:47] only oh I only scratch with the right
[59:50] hand it's going to be awful I'm telling
[59:53] you when you get a a a niche on that
[59:55] elbow there and you're bending and
[59:57] you're bending and you're twisting and
[1:00:00] you see you're laughing it it's it's
[1:00:02] dumb isn't it well it's the same way in
[1:00:04] the spiritual body of the Lord Jesus
[1:00:07] people get that way well I I I only
[1:00:09] listen to this preacher and I I don't go
[1:00:11] to church and I'm just you're going to
[1:00:12] be hurting on that elbow goes to you
[1:00:15] know and youve limited it only to that
[1:00:16] one aspect right there but God has
[1:00:19] placed so many different things in the
[1:00:21] body and what's it for it's not to
[1:00:23] minister to those who have the gifts but
[1:00:25] it's to minister to those who need
[1:00:27] ministering to so myself I want to
[1:00:30] receive everything that God has don't
[1:00:32] you every aspect of the body you know
[1:00:35] whenever people look at that and out in
[1:00:37] the world they can say they believe
[1:00:38] every word he said and they don't even
[1:00:40] go to church well they've not moved very
[1:00:42] far really have they he says so you
[1:00:44] can't wait for them doors to open to get
[1:00:46] in here to fellowship with your brothers
[1:00:48] and if you don't feel that way then I
[1:00:50] tell you it's time you got to praying
[1:00:54] and the Church said because we're in the
[1:00:56] last days well the Bible exhorted us to
[1:00:58] much more as we see the day approaching
[1:01:00] to love one another with Christian love
[1:01:03] and with Divine Love Now notice them two
[1:01:05] different degrees of love you see that's
[1:01:07] the thing that many people don't
[1:01:09] understand about love that love is not
[1:01:11] just one open Channel but there's many
[1:01:13] degrees many different types and we know
[1:01:15] that it came from the Eternal in the
[1:01:17] beginning and as it started coming on
[1:01:19] down it was like it got narrower and
[1:01:20] narrower as it came on down and it
[1:01:22] finally comes into the very bottom of
[1:01:24] human love lust and Corruption and all
[1:01:27] that sort of thing and the only way to
[1:01:29] ever get back up to the top is for the
[1:01:31] one at the top to pull us into himself
[1:01:34] now we receive thank God Christian love
[1:01:37] for one another when we first start but
[1:01:39] it takes God himself to give us that
[1:01:42] Divine love now watch this he says with
[1:01:44] Christian love and divine love to
[1:01:47] assemble ourselves together in Heavenly
[1:01:49] places and Christ Jesus and love one
[1:01:51] another this will all men know that you
[1:01:54] are my disciples I read to you a couple
[1:01:56] of weeks ago where the different
[1:01:58] historians in the time of the first
[1:02:00] century 2 Century third Century on up to
[1:02:03] the 4th century and it was one of the
[1:02:06] most notable things that the historians
[1:02:08] wrote now there were not Christian
[1:02:10] historians there were just Roman
[1:02:12] historians or historians from different
[1:02:14] uh cities around the time frame of the
[1:02:16] Roman Empire and they would write about
[1:02:19] the Christians now they saw Miracles and
[1:02:21] they knew they did signs and wonders and
[1:02:23] things like that but one thing I found
[1:02:25] that was a Common Thread among these
[1:02:27] historians was that they wrote about the
[1:02:30] way they lived and they wrote about the
[1:02:33] way they died so they wrote about these
[1:02:35] Christians and how much love they had
[1:02:38] for one another now they knew that they
[1:02:40] rais the dead and healed the sick but
[1:02:42] that wasn't the thing that really stuck
[1:02:44] out to them so much it was that they
[1:02:47] loved one another you remember I quoted
[1:02:50] to you that one of the historians said
[1:02:52] that their Master convinced es them that
[1:02:55] they are brothers their Master convinces
[1:02:59] them that they are brothers well if
[1:03:01] we've got the same Master he still does
[1:03:03] the same thing to us so we love one
[1:03:06] another but the thing is being able to
[1:03:08] love one another without selfish Love
[1:03:11] Now many people love you know a boy will
[1:03:14] meet a girl and he fall they fall in
[1:03:16] love and she falls in love with him and
[1:03:18] they don't realize they don't even
[1:03:19] realize that there's so much selfishness
[1:03:22] that's involved in that first step of
[1:03:25] Love well I I I want to get married
[1:03:27] because it'll benefit me this way and
[1:03:29] it'll benefit me that way sis you better
[1:03:32] watch
[1:03:33] out brother you better watch out because
[1:03:36] all of our human love is so coaled
[1:03:39] together with selfishness we just can't
[1:03:42] help it it's the way we're made and the
[1:03:44] way we fell into after the fall and
[1:03:47] there's only one thing that can help us
[1:03:49] and ever turn us around that's why a man
[1:03:51] can never be able to love his wife the
[1:03:53] way that he should without the baptism
[1:03:56] of the Holy Ghost because he will love
[1:03:58] her yes he would be willing to do all
[1:04:00] kinds of things for her but he will
[1:04:02] still have that element of selfishness
[1:04:05] that'll be there people come to the Lord
[1:04:07] Jesus and many of them come to him
[1:04:09] because they do not want to be lost they
[1:04:12] do not want to go to hell they do not
[1:04:14] want to perish so they come to the Lord
[1:04:17] Jesus with an element of selfish love
[1:04:20] it's all about what they can get all
[1:04:22] about what he can do for them and and if
[1:04:24] he asks them one little thing quit this
[1:04:27] don't do that quit what my goodness you
[1:04:31] mean I've got to do something you mean I
[1:04:33] I I've got to give up this and I oh I I
[1:04:36] am so appalled I cannot believe I
[1:04:38] thought everything about this was a free
[1:04:40] gift salvation is but whenever you fall
[1:04:43] in love with him and if you really love
[1:04:45] him he wants to see how much you love
[1:04:47] him do you love him just beyond a ticket
[1:04:50] Escape Out of Hell or do you love him
[1:04:52] more than anything else in this world do
[1:04:56] you want to give him everything that you
[1:04:58] are do you absolutely want to die to
[1:05:01] yourself and that's one thing of course
[1:05:03] that separates the bride from the church
[1:05:05] because the church still is so engulfed
[1:05:08] in that selfishness of love but the real
[1:05:10] people of God of course they move on
[1:05:12] into that reality notice in 1
[1:05:15] Corinthians Chapter 13 Verse 8 as Paul
[1:05:17] again describes about this Agape 11 he
[1:05:20] says charity never failes but whether
[1:05:23] there be prophecies they shall fail
[1:05:26] whether there be tongues they shall
[1:05:27] cease whether there be knowledge it
[1:05:29] shall vanish away for we know in part
[1:05:33] and we prophesy in part but when that
[1:05:35] which is perfect has come that which is
[1:05:38] in part is done away when I was a as a
[1:05:41] child rather I spake as a child I
[1:05:43] understood as a child I thought as a
[1:05:46] child when I became a man I put away
[1:05:49] childish things for now we see through a
[1:05:52] glass Darkly but then face to face now I
[1:05:55] know in part but then shall I know even
[1:05:58] as I am also and known now Abid us
[1:06:00] notice these faith hope and charity
[1:06:04] these three but the greatest of these is
[1:06:08] Charity but it it amazing how that we
[1:06:11] would look at a person that would have
[1:06:13] great miraculous faith and they would be
[1:06:16] able to lay hands on the sick and say
[1:06:18] they've not only got the gift of faith
[1:06:19] but they also have the gift of healings
[1:06:21] or the gift of Miracles and we would
[1:06:23] look with them and that would be the one
[1:06:26] that we would make our hero and there
[1:06:29] might be another one that might not have
[1:06:31] either of those gifts but they would
[1:06:33] have such love in their hearts and they
[1:06:37] are able to love their enemies and pray
[1:06:39] for their enemies and everything Jesus
[1:06:42] asked of them individuals they give it
[1:06:44] to them which one would we think would
[1:06:47] be the greater person most of us would
[1:06:50] pick the one with great faith you know
[1:06:53] why because there's something about that
[1:06:55] that gets our attention hey I believe in
[1:06:58] miracles I've seen them since I was a
[1:06:59] little boy I believe them with all of my
[1:07:02] heart but not only do I want Miracles I
[1:07:05] want this kind of love because there'll
[1:07:08] be many sign workers that'll be able to
[1:07:11] stand before God as a matter of fact I
[1:07:13] saw a little documentary La last night
[1:07:17] and it was from some of the African
[1:07:19] countries and it was people that was
[1:07:22] coming to uh me that were practicing
[1:07:25] supposedly Divine Healing and I saw them
[1:07:28] as they would come to these men and
[1:07:30] they' lay hands on them and that that
[1:07:32] that jerk and shout and many different
[1:07:35] things was actually happening in these
[1:07:38] Services as they called them and yet
[1:07:40] they found out that by a little bit of
[1:07:43] hidden microphone and a little hidden
[1:07:45] camera that many of these guys are
[1:07:47] nothing but charlatans many of them
[1:07:49] whenever they get they'd pray for these
[1:07:51] people and whenever they'd get healed
[1:07:53] especially the women they would call
[1:07:55] them into their private residence and
[1:07:58] they'd want a little private payment for
[1:08:00] what they had just done so you see signs
[1:08:03] and wonders and miracles alone is not
[1:08:06] what we look for these signs shall
[1:08:08] follow them that believe so the order is
[1:08:11] signs follow us we don't follow them but
[1:08:14] if a person has real charity real love
[1:08:17] of God you never have to worry about a
[1:08:19] man of God doing that because he's doing
[1:08:21] it based upon charity not based upon
[1:08:25] Faith you see whenever our foundation is
[1:08:28] this as a prophet has said I've already
[1:08:30] quoted to you but as a prophet is so
[1:08:32] beautifully laid it out for us that
[1:08:34] perfect love will produce perfect gifts
[1:08:38] so what will selfish love produce it
[1:08:41] will produce a mixture of gifts but
[1:08:45] still with the element of selfishness
[1:08:48] and then you find them men many of them
[1:08:50] it's all about them they have more
[1:08:52] Miracles more signs more w wonders and
[1:08:54] anytime you hear it you know that that
[1:08:56] individual may have great face but their
[1:08:59] love does not match their faith so this
[1:09:02] is where Kingdom Builders come in now
[1:09:05] we've had them of course since the dawn
[1:09:06] of time Kingdom Builders will use the
[1:09:09] gifts that God gives them to minister to
[1:09:11] the body but because they have such a
[1:09:13] degree of selfishness there left in the
[1:09:16] humanity it's always about them and what
[1:09:19] I prayed for this one and I prayed for
[1:09:20] that one and I done this and i' done
[1:09:23] that and I done something else oh how
[1:09:25] God hates that sort of thing notice now
[1:09:28] he says abideth now abideth faith hope
[1:09:30] and charity these three but the greatest
[1:09:33] of these is Charity chapter 14 verse1
[1:09:37] follow after charity and desire
[1:09:40] spiritual gifts but rather that you may
[1:09:43] prophesy now let me ask you just a
[1:09:45] simple question today if we would have
[1:09:47] been in the first century and some of us
[1:09:50] here today would have been kin to the
[1:09:52] man called Steven and say Steven would
[1:09:55] have been our father our brother our
[1:09:57] uncle our grandson our great nephew
[1:10:00] whatever Steven would have been and
[1:10:02] Steph was a man of God filled with the
[1:10:04] Holy Ghost a deacon and and a preacher
[1:10:06] too some and he was a man that really
[1:10:09] loved the lord and there was a man that
[1:10:11] we know formerly by his first name of
[1:10:13] his own nature a Saul and we know that
[1:10:16] the people laid their garments at the
[1:10:18] feet of Saul and it was actually through
[1:10:20] Saul's Administration that they killed
[1:10:23] this man stoned him and he become the
[1:10:25] first martyr in the New Testament then
[1:10:27] later we hear that Saul has become saved
[1:10:31] he's become supposedly filled with the
[1:10:33] Holy Ghost and now he's a preacher of
[1:10:35] the message and Paul is coming to your
[1:10:38] home church for a meeting
[1:10:42] oh but your uncle was
[1:10:45] Stephen your brother was Steph your
[1:10:48] cousin was
[1:10:50] Stephen would you went to church that
[1:10:52] weekend
[1:10:54] come
[1:10:55] on now how deep does our love really
[1:10:59] really
[1:11:01] work I personally believe with all of my
[1:11:04] heart one of the things that we're
[1:11:05] missing in the message Community is such
[1:11:08] a baptism of the love of God I ain't
[1:11:11] talking about to make us compromise I'm
[1:11:14] talking about that we can love our
[1:11:15] enemies and pray for them and feel no
[1:11:19] desire of Revenge in our hearts for them
[1:11:24] it's amazing how many Christians hold
[1:11:26] grudges in their hearts and they will
[1:11:28] get you back if it's the last thing they
[1:11:31] do they will say things they will they
[1:11:34] will make their point and then we think
[1:11:37] we are ready for the Rapture to me
[1:11:39] friends it's no wonder we're any farther
[1:11:41] along than what we are amen well come on
[1:11:45] now it's not a lack of knowledge for
[1:11:47] many of us it's a lack of obedience to
[1:11:51] what we know we should do as a Pastor I
[1:11:54] hear it so much oh I know I know I know
[1:11:57] I know I know what good does it do you
[1:12:00] to know if you ain't going to do it I
[1:12:03] know what I need to do I know where I
[1:12:05] need to be I know I need to do better I
[1:12:08] know I need to do this what good does it
[1:12:10] do if all we do is know it and we don't
[1:12:14] let it live itself out of our Lives now
[1:12:18] think about it so let's just let's just
[1:12:20] move our church now back to the first
[1:12:22] century Word of Life Church is there and
[1:12:25] we hear that this man Paul so-called has
[1:12:28] become converted got the Holy Ghost we
[1:12:30] still got our doubts of course and then
[1:12:32] we find out no no wait a minute now
[1:12:34] you've got to kid me Brother Don you
[1:12:35] you've invited this man to come to our
[1:12:39] church to preach and this man was
[1:12:42] actually the one who was responsible for
[1:12:45] getting my uncle stepen killed they laid
[1:12:48] their garments at his feet or could you
[1:12:51] have went there and really prayed true
[1:12:54] and you could have said God help me Lord
[1:12:56] you say I'm on a struggle Lord I I I I
[1:12:58] don't understand but God I I I want to
[1:13:01] feel toward that man with the genuine
[1:13:03] love I ain't going to ask you to raise
[1:13:05] your hand but I want you to just think
[1:13:08] about it
[1:13:09] today you see the way we react today in
[1:13:13] this Century would pretty much give us
[1:13:15] an idea of what we would have done in
[1:13:17] that Century because if people hurt us
[1:13:19] today and hurt us deeply how many of us
[1:13:22] can be able to love them anyhow and pray
[1:13:25] for them over all the top of the hurt or
[1:13:28] when their name is mentioned is the
[1:13:30] predominant thing that we think about
[1:13:32] not their soul and God deliver them and
[1:13:35] God have mercy on them I hope they can
[1:13:38] be saved I hope they can be reconciled
[1:13:40] to God is that what we think about first
[1:13:43] and foremost or do we think about I'll
[1:13:45] never forgive them I'll tell you one
[1:13:47] thing they done this and that and the
[1:13:49] other to me I hope and pray they go to
[1:13:52] hell if you you feel that way about
[1:13:54] anybody today you need to hit this altar
[1:13:57] before this service is
[1:13:59] over remember the Lord Jesus could look
[1:14:01] at those that crucified him and said
[1:14:03] father forgive them they don't even know
[1:14:06] what they have done and what they are
[1:14:08] doing now whenever we get into the to
[1:14:11] the the Salvation stages of accepting
[1:14:14] the Lord and then the Lord sanctifies us
[1:14:17] and the Lord gives us the baptism
[1:14:18] immerses our soul into the spirit of God
[1:14:21] and our soul is sealed and we know that
[1:14:23] it starts out in this tiny form of the
[1:14:26] true baptism of the Holy Ghost which is
[1:14:28] Zoe the personal life of God and it
[1:14:31] starts growing like that little white
[1:14:33] button on your shirt brothers and it
[1:14:35] starts getting greater and greater and
[1:14:37] multiplies and we think oh my I've
[1:14:39] arrived at this place and I'm really to
[1:14:41] that position but John being the Apostle
[1:14:44] of love and he wrote about love in a way
[1:14:46] that none of the rest of the men did and
[1:14:48] I read it to you a week or so ago where
[1:14:50] brother Rand said that Peter was the
[1:14:52] chosen an apostle for miracles now I'm
[1:14:55] sure you've noticed it by reading the
[1:14:56] Bible that we don't have near as many
[1:14:59] records of John doing the miraculous as
[1:15:03] Peter did but we don't have Peter much
[1:15:07] written about him expressing the love of
[1:15:10] God that John did so you mean to tell me
[1:15:13] that everybody is not going to be
[1:15:15] exactly the same way so Peter was not
[1:15:18] called the Apostle of love but John was
[1:15:21] so John had an Insight in to the
[1:15:23] presence of God and about agape love
[1:15:26] that Peter probably looked at and
[1:15:28] thought my my I I wish I could be more
[1:15:31] like John I wish it could be more like
[1:15:32] that maybe John turned around and said I
[1:15:35] wish I could be more like Peter you know
[1:15:38] I I was along with Peter when many
[1:15:40] miracles happen but I I've seen the sick
[1:15:42] healed and I've seen things happen out
[1:15:44] of my Ministry but God never give it to
[1:15:46] me and that measure isn't it amazing
[1:15:48] though how that we might compare them
[1:15:50] and look at them and say oh that guy
[1:15:52] right there man I'm telling you you
[1:15:54] talking about a man right there he's a
[1:15:56] he's a real faith-building man that
[1:15:59] Peter boy I'll tell you he just SS out
[1:16:01] there he's as bold as he can be and John
[1:16:04] would have to kind of hang his head no
[1:16:06] doubt but yet there was something about
[1:16:08] John that was able to tap into the very
[1:16:11] Heart Of God which will be Eternal I
[1:16:15] wonder if the Lord hasn't and is doing
[1:16:17] the same thing in our own ranks that
[1:16:20] there are certain people that will never
[1:16:22] attain to the same element and level of
[1:16:25] the miraculous in their Ministry yet
[1:16:27] they love the Lord they appreciate
[1:16:29] everything that God is doing in the
[1:16:31] Supernatural but it's just not been
[1:16:33] given to them but yet they are actually
[1:16:35] used in the body of God to be one that
[1:16:39] God will allow to be run down they will
[1:16:41] be hated they will be criticized and it
[1:16:44] seems so unusual why is it that that
[1:16:47] that one person or that one person or
[1:16:49] that man or that why is it that it seems
[1:16:51] like they are so hated above so many
[1:16:54] others wonder if God wrote it out in
[1:16:57] their life that they would be able to
[1:16:59] express the attribute of forgiveness and
[1:17:02] humility and Reconciliation and people
[1:17:05] that run them down and talk about them
[1:17:08] and then you find out years later oh the
[1:17:10] they're best of friends again and you're
[1:17:12] probably thinking it was the other
[1:17:14] person that made it right when in
[1:17:15] reality it probably wasn't at all it was
[1:17:18] that one that was actually called to
[1:17:21] live out the example of Jesus in
[1:17:24] forgiveness but which would be our
[1:17:26] choice the example of Jesus in
[1:17:29] forgiveness the example of Jesus in
[1:17:32] humility the example of Jesus in mature
[1:17:35] perfect love or the example of Jesus and
[1:17:39] walking on water the example of Jesus of
[1:17:42] standing up in a prayer line Satan in
[1:17:45] the name of Jesus come out of that
[1:17:47] person and we watch him shout and scream
[1:17:50] and run across the P Hallelujah
[1:17:53] Hallelujah we say wow what a
[1:17:57] Ministry and yet maybe that man has a
[1:17:59] hard time forgiving
[1:18:02] someone come on I wonder if we haven't
[1:18:05] made the wrong Heroes our example
[1:18:08] sometimes friends now think of it what
[1:18:11] John says here in verse 17 here in is
[1:18:14] our love made perfect made so it's not
[1:18:19] like it's given to you in perfect form
[1:18:21] when you initially received it but
[1:18:23] herein is our love made so this is the
[1:18:27] same maker that in the beginning created
[1:18:30] the heavens and the Earth and the Earth
[1:18:32] was made so he's still creating you're
[1:18:36] looking for creation you're looking for
[1:18:38] miracles look around this building
[1:18:40] you'll see hundreds of them look in your
[1:18:42] mirror and you get in your car you'll
[1:18:43] see another one so what's he doing he's
[1:18:46] still making so it's not like that
[1:18:49] whenever we receive the Holy Ghost we
[1:18:51] receive it in its perfect mature
[1:18:54] complete format but we receive it and
[1:18:56] it's a baby yet as we would say and
[1:18:59] whenever it goes to growing and maturing
[1:19:02] and notice the word that John uses he
[1:19:04] said herein is our love made perfect
[1:19:06] that we may have boldness in the day of
[1:19:10] judgment so what in the world would that
[1:19:12] do you see a person who's received this
[1:19:15] from the Lord God they have no fear of
[1:19:17] standing before him at that day which is
[1:19:20] absolutely contrary to human makeup and
[1:19:22] in human nature who which one here Among
[1:19:26] Us would not be fearful of your life
[1:19:29] standing before God just humanly how
[1:19:31] many's made mistakes I'm telling that
[1:19:33] since you've been in church this morning
[1:19:35] how many's fell short of the glory of
[1:19:37] God every day of your life how many of
[1:19:38] us need Mercy every day of our life
[1:19:40] Grace every day of our life and yet you
[1:19:43] by the grace of God once you receive
[1:19:45] this love and it's maturity in your
[1:19:47] heart then you realize you can walk
[1:19:50] before the Lord God with boldness on
[1:19:53] that day but brother Donnie in spite of
[1:19:55] our Humanity in spite of our mistakes
[1:19:57] yes because the love has actually
[1:20:00] reached to stage of perfect now remember
[1:20:02] the word perfect elos is not sinlessness
[1:20:05] but it's
[1:20:06] maturity now notice John goes on to say
[1:20:09] that we may have boldness in the day of
[1:20:11] judgment because as he is so are we in
[1:20:17] this world how in the world can that
[1:20:18] even be as he is so are we in this
[1:20:23] present world so we have the same traits
[1:20:26] that the Savior has right now the same
[1:20:30] character the same molding the same
[1:20:33] material so we don't need to be alarmed
[1:20:35] at the prospect that we will walk up
[1:20:38] before the great judgment seat of Christ
[1:20:41] now remember the bride never faces the
[1:20:43] white Throne judgment but we do walk
[1:20:46] before this seed of Christ whenever we
[1:20:48] will receive rewards for what we have
[1:20:51] done but yet knowing that in our hearts
[1:20:54] how could we ever do that and yet we
[1:20:57] will walk up with boldness not with fear
[1:21:00] we will not be terrorized because
[1:21:03] perfect love has cast out that
[1:21:06] fear now the word fear that John uses
[1:21:10] there is the word where we get phobias
[1:21:12] from oh my goodness there's hundreds of
[1:21:14] them in this day aren't we there's all
[1:21:16] types of phobias and fear so the word
[1:21:19] that he chose to use was the word from
[1:21:21] phobia but also means a terror now he's
[1:21:25] not saying that we lose our fear for God
[1:21:27] there's all types of fears that are
[1:21:29] built in our Humanity that's actually
[1:21:31] good for us so we hear a certain sound
[1:21:33] we react you know somebody stops in
[1:21:35] front every 3/4s of a second your brain
[1:21:38] responds your foot goes on the on the
[1:21:40] brake pedal that's a fear that you
[1:21:41] always need especially with the drivers
[1:21:44] in this day so there's things about that
[1:21:46] that we will always need and perfect
[1:21:48] love will not take that out you
[1:21:50] understand but the fear that God wants
[1:21:52] to rid us of is the servile fear which a
[1:21:56] servant has that a servant has so the
[1:22:00] servant would be constantly terrified of
[1:22:03] his master that he would displease him
[1:22:05] especially after the servant got married
[1:22:08] and then they would have children well
[1:22:09] they would always hold that over their
[1:22:11] head that if the servant did something
[1:22:14] that displeased his master that his
[1:22:16] master had the right to sell his wife
[1:22:19] and sell his children so he would serve
[1:22:22] this man Master under this Dome of fear
[1:22:25] that every day every hour oh I'm so
[1:22:28] nervous I'm so tore up what if I would
[1:22:30] do something and and I would displease
[1:22:32] my master and he would sell my wife or
[1:22:35] he would sell my children I could never
[1:22:36] live under that it's terrible how many
[1:22:39] Christians live under that surviv fear
[1:22:42] of the Lord Jesus instead of under a
[1:22:44] love relationship of what he wants it to
[1:22:47] be now want you notice here the prophet
[1:22:49] he says you might go to all kinds of
[1:22:51] emotions and carry on every way and
[1:22:53] calling the name of religion the
[1:22:55] heathens do the same thing but give me a
[1:22:58] consecrated life that's dead and rose
[1:23:01] again in Christ Jesus who lives in the
[1:23:03] shika Glory with the love of God around
[1:23:06] them that's the person I would believe
[1:23:09] that's going to be there God that's the
[1:23:10] kind of person I want to be put me
[1:23:13] beneath the veil under the blood of the
[1:23:15] Lord Jesus take all your gifts that you
[1:23:18] have in the scripture and the devil can
[1:23:20] impersonate every one of them but he
[1:23:23] can't impersonate love he can't
[1:23:28] impersonate now you and I both know
[1:23:30] we've had friends we've even had family
[1:23:32] members and we've had people in the
[1:23:34] family of God oh brother I love you so
[1:23:37] much sister I love you so much and while
[1:23:40] they was telling you that they were
[1:23:41] sharpening their knife to stab in your
[1:23:44] back well come on don't sit there and
[1:23:46] look at me like you ain't never had it
[1:23:47] happen to you people can say that they
[1:23:50] can love you but in reality we don't we
[1:23:52] don't prove our love just by our words
[1:23:55] but we prove our love also by our Deeds
[1:23:58] so herein is the love of God made
[1:24:01] manifest so the the devil can
[1:24:03] impersonate every gift that God's got
[1:24:06] but he can't impersonate love because
[1:24:09] love is genuine the devil can't love
[1:24:12] think of this the devil can't love it's
[1:24:16] not in him Angels you imagine every
[1:24:19] person out here today that is living for
[1:24:21] the devil they are serving a master that
[1:24:25] does care nothing for them he does not
[1:24:28] love them he cannot give them a heaven
[1:24:30] he has no Heaven he cannot give them
[1:24:32] peace he has no peace he cannot give
[1:24:34] them love he has no love can you imagine
[1:24:37] what the kingdom of hell is actually
[1:24:39] like I've often wondered myself if we
[1:24:42] were privileged to be able to go down
[1:24:44] into that region where they are and hear
[1:24:47] them as they argue and debate and fuss
[1:24:50] and Carry On The Prophet tells us in
[1:24:51] Victor day the reason that that we have
[1:24:53] wars is because the spiritual uh aspect
[1:24:56] of it going on that the spirits of
[1:24:58] Nations get jealous of one another so
[1:25:01] say the spirit in Yemen will get jealous
[1:25:03] of the spirit of Israel and the spirit
[1:25:05] of in Iran will get jealous of the
[1:25:07] spirit in Israel seem like there's a lot
[1:25:09] of them demons jealous of Israel today
[1:25:11] ain't they so them demons over them
[1:25:13] Nations and where they all come from
[1:25:15] well they come originally they were
[1:25:16] angels of God but his kingdom was built
[1:25:19] upon deception and deceit and Division
[1:25:22] so that's the foundation of his kingdom
[1:25:24] what's his kingdom going to be division
[1:25:26] turmoil how it must be down in hell that
[1:25:29] Satan constantly has to set him down and
[1:25:32] shut them up how he has to constant quit
[1:25:34] fighting you Devils quit fighting right
[1:25:37] now I'm sick and tired of it well you
[1:25:39] shouldn't have never started this kind
[1:25:40] of kingdom in the first place if you
[1:25:42] didn't want it but they cannot truly
[1:25:45] love neither can Satan truly love let me
[1:25:49] go a little farther neither can you
[1:25:51] that's right
[1:25:53] neither can I it's beyond our human
[1:25:57] capability to love in this way it's
[1:26:01] beyond us there's no way to attain to it
[1:26:03] without a new birth the devil can't love
[1:26:05] that's one thing he can't do when you
[1:26:07] get to a place that you love one another
[1:26:09] and all the world is dead that's what we
[1:26:11] want brother sisters now notice again 1
[1:26:14] John 4:18 notice how John says there is
[1:26:17] no fear look at the word there the Greek
[1:26:20] word phobus which is where we give
[1:26:21] phobia from
[1:26:23] Terror dread are that which strikes
[1:26:26] Terror there is no fear in love but
[1:26:30] perfect love cast us
[1:26:34] out my goodness he's making this sound
[1:26:38] like it's a devil
[1:26:41] leaving but perfect love casteth out
[1:26:46] fear so the man who knows or the woman
[1:26:49] that he loves God and he's heart can
[1:26:53] never dread him as a
[1:26:56] judge cuz you won't meet him as a judge
[1:27:00] you'll meet him as a
[1:27:02] husband a husband that gave his life for
[1:27:06] you there is no fear in love but perfect
[1:27:09] love casteth out fear because fear has
[1:27:12] torment how many can say Amen to that
[1:27:15] you ever get afraid of this or that or
[1:27:17] the other whatever it is and what does
[1:27:18] it produce it produces a torment he that
[1:27:22] fearth is not made perfect in Love Now
[1:27:26] you see whenever we become then a
[1:27:28] partaker of his divine nature according
[1:27:30] to what Peter said it carries a sense of
[1:27:34] the release of the Judgment of God and
[1:27:37] we know beyond a shadow of doubt that we
[1:27:40] have passed from Death un life we don't
[1:27:42] have that fear of ever having to stand
[1:27:44] before him as a judge and that fear of
[1:27:48] us being lost because that brings
[1:27:50] torment love
[1:27:52] implies affection but
[1:27:56] fear implies
[1:27:58] repulsion so love what does it imply
[1:28:02] affection and attraction you understand
[1:28:05] that God is attracted to
[1:28:10] you God is attracted to you you know
[1:28:15] what gets his attention the prophet said
[1:28:17] keeping God's word is what gets his
[1:28:21] attention so real Divine love produces
[1:28:24] what an attraction those of you that met
[1:28:27] your husband your wife what was it about
[1:28:29] that one that stuck out to you more than
[1:28:32] than another and there was an attraction
[1:28:35] about them might have been their smile
[1:28:37] might have been an element of their
[1:28:39] looks their personality combination no
[1:28:41] doubt of many many things and there was
[1:28:43] an attraction that it be to form an
[1:28:45] attachment from there it grew into a
[1:28:48] love but then what does repulsion what
[1:28:51] does that do so this certain per person
[1:28:53] would repulse you or repulse me and and
[1:28:56] that that within itself produces a
[1:28:59] rejection and that's the way many people
[1:29:01] serve God like they're going to be
[1:29:03] repulsed and God's out to get them and
[1:29:05] if you make a mistake and fall short of
[1:29:07] the glory of God he's just waiting boy
[1:29:09] he's just waiting to smack you many of
[1:29:11] them have been raised up like a father
[1:29:13] like that or they were abused and they
[1:29:15] relate in their their you know their
[1:29:17] subconscious and their psychology part
[1:29:19] they relate to God being the same way is
[1:29:22] their abusive husband or their abusive
[1:29:24] father or whatever it was in their life
[1:29:26] but God ain't like that and the church
[1:29:28] said I said God ain't like that you see
[1:29:33] God wants to be attracted to us and God
[1:29:37] wants us to be attracted to him then we
[1:29:41] would love him so much that no matter
[1:29:43] what Satan would ever offer Us in the
[1:29:45] world would say are you kidding me you
[1:29:47] think I'd ever want to leave this lovely
[1:29:49] Lord Jesus and walk out there with you
[1:29:51] you ain't got no No Heaven you ain't got
[1:29:52] no love you ain't got none of these good
[1:29:54] things that God's that's what God wants
[1:29:56] us to do to where we as the bride of
[1:29:59] Christ when Satan offers us this and
[1:30:01] that and the other of the world we look
[1:30:03] at him and said there ain't no way God
[1:30:05] don't want it to be to where the
[1:30:06] preachers have to stand in the pull pit
[1:30:08] with a big bull whip about 14t long to
[1:30:11] reach from on the back pew and and just
[1:30:13] beat the time out of you every time you
[1:30:15] come the church God wants the preachers
[1:30:17] to be able to be so Anointed with his
[1:30:20] heart and with his love
[1:30:22] that their preaching will make us fall
[1:30:24] in love with the Lord Jesus more than
[1:30:26] we've ever been in our life and we will
[1:30:29] not serve the Lord God because of chains
[1:30:31] and a big ball hung onto our leg but
[1:30:34] we'll say praise God I'm free I'm free
[1:30:38] to love I'm free to worship I'm free to
[1:30:41] be what God wants me to be I'm not held
[1:30:44] here by bondage I don't know about you
[1:30:46] today I don't come to this church
[1:30:48] because I'm scared to death I don't come
[1:30:50] to this church I don't believe this
[1:30:52] message because I'm scared I'll go to
[1:30:54] hell I love this word I love to come to
[1:30:58] this church I love to worship God I love
[1:31:02] to live for him every day I do not fear
[1:31:06] him with a phobia I have no Terror of
[1:31:10] God in my
[1:31:16] heart oh I do have that element of fear
[1:31:19] afraid that I might displease him
[1:31:20] somehow
[1:31:22] but that's not a phobia you see it's
[1:31:25] something perfect love that's not
[1:31:28] natural to any of us it can't be because
[1:31:31] of the fall and sometimes we might
[1:31:34] imagine that we've actually reached a
[1:31:37] pretty good spot in our walk with God
[1:31:40] and the Lord will allow something to
[1:31:42] come up in our life or maybe I should
[1:31:45] say
[1:31:47] someone it's amazing ain't it the people
[1:31:50] can be some of the greatest in
[1:31:51] encouragement that we get they can also
[1:31:54] be some of the greatest battles that we
[1:31:56] carry some of the most difficult things
[1:31:58] in our life can be
[1:32:00] people any y'all ever had a breakdown
[1:32:03] because of a
[1:32:05] dog cat Ox fish horse
[1:32:10] cow where's most of your problems come
[1:32:13] from humans right some of them's your
[1:32:17] family some of them's your church family
[1:32:20] I know some of y'all think it's your
[1:32:22] pastor but really it ain't me friend I'm
[1:32:23] for
[1:32:25] you I mean I am guilty of burning your
[1:32:27] hide every now and then but that's just
[1:32:28] comes with a with a position now you see
[1:32:31] the way John looks at this he said
[1:32:33] there's no fear in love so love and fear
[1:32:38] can only
[1:32:40] co-exist when love is not
[1:32:45] perfect there is no fear in this degree
[1:32:49] of love that God wants us to have
[1:32:52] but fear and love can go can
[1:32:56] coexist when love is not reached
[1:33:00] maturity so a person loves God but they
[1:33:03] still have this phobia about him they
[1:33:06] love him and they love they love church
[1:33:08] and they love the pastor sort of but
[1:33:11] they're scared to death of
[1:33:15] him go up there and speak to Brother Don
[1:33:18] you kidding me Lord have
[1:33:20] mercy
[1:33:23] you got two contrasts that are coing
[1:33:25] existing in your
[1:33:27] heart so love and fear can only coexist
[1:33:30] when the degree of love has never
[1:33:33] reached the state of perfection
[1:33:35] maturity because once it reaches that
[1:33:38] it's like the maturity of This Love
[1:33:41] Actually cast out that element of fear
[1:33:45] so perfect love absolutely will not
[1:33:48] exist in the same soul with with fear
[1:33:52] but immature love young love love that
[1:33:55] is never fully grown up it will shift
[1:33:59] our emotions in one way and then fear
[1:34:01] will take a hold and we go the other way
[1:34:03] anybody here know what I'm talking about
[1:34:04] this morning anybody ever felt fear and
[1:34:07] love sure notice he said there is no
[1:34:10] fear in love but perfect love casteth th
[1:34:12] fear because fear hath torment he that
[1:34:15] fears is not made perfect in love so
[1:34:18] love that is complete when it reaches
[1:34:22] its proper extent of maturity it will
[1:34:26] eliminate death this is why Christians
[1:34:28] can face death and not be afraid can't
[1:34:32] you understand this is man's greatest
[1:34:34] fear is death whatever we get the flu
[1:34:38] whenever people got Co whenever this
[1:34:40] that and other happens it's not just the
[1:34:42] thing of Co itself it's what Co can lead
[1:34:45] to what death so what is it many of the
[1:34:48] diseases and things that people get
[1:34:50] ultimately should we think well I've got
[1:34:52] this disease or that disease but what
[1:34:54] are we terrified of that that disease
[1:34:56] would lead us to death and whenever we
[1:34:59] look and think about it that for a real
[1:35:01] child of God facing man's greatest fear
[1:35:05] how can they ever look at it in the face
[1:35:07] and actually laugh at it because their
[1:35:10] love has
[1:35:13] matured praise God brother Ron Spencer
[1:35:16] told me the other day whenever I saw him
[1:35:18] a week or so ago it's been brother
[1:35:20] Charlie many of you that knew brother
[1:35:22] Charlie and some of you didn't but
[1:35:23] brother Charlie Spencer I'll tell you he
[1:35:25] was quite a guy and brother Ron said
[1:35:28] every time he would call him he said I
[1:35:31] was preaching in the
[1:35:33] background and he said Daddy would you
[1:35:36] please turn Donnie
[1:35:38] down I can't even hear you
[1:35:42] Daddy brother Ron talked to brother
[1:35:44] Charlie about an hour before he
[1:35:46] passed whenever he passed an hour
[1:35:49] thereafter he was listening to One of of
[1:35:51] our services at the
[1:35:53] church and I it just struck me I thought
[1:35:55] my goodness you you're talking about
[1:35:57] something that you're you're laying
[1:35:58] there listen to a service and one moment
[1:36:01] you're amen and shouting and praising
[1:36:03] God hearing an anointed servant of God
[1:36:06] preaching whoever that servant would be
[1:36:08] and then the next moment you've jumped
[1:36:10] into a theophany and you've passed death
[1:36:13] and you just continue on Hallelujah you
[1:36:17] just continue on that word that you were
[1:36:20] hearing just a few minutes ago and you
[1:36:23] were able to move into that Dimension
[1:36:26] that's the way I want to face death if I
[1:36:29] ever have to face it I want to be able
[1:36:31] to be praying be able to read my Bible
[1:36:34] sitting there with my computer my L
[1:36:36] maybe in the CLS is speaking in tongues
[1:36:38] I don't know what I'll be doing but I'll
[1:36:40] simply change from this life and one
[1:36:43] moment I'll move into another body into
[1:36:47] another dimension by the spirit of God
[1:36:50] and say yes you don't make me tremble
[1:36:53] because you are not my master I am
[1:36:57] yours Hallelujah all you can do is take
[1:37:01] me to the other
[1:37:02] [Applause]
[1:37:06] side oh
[1:37:08] my thank you
[1:37:11] Lord fear
[1:37:13] has
[1:37:17] torment it's a painful distressing
[1:37:25] emotion every now and then I get this
[1:37:27] call n from this number
[1:37:31] 926
[1:37:33] 33 1
[1:37:37] 1 my heart will
[1:37:40] rise I can feel my blood
[1:37:42] pressure I break out my
[1:37:45] sweat it's the
[1:37:50] dentist
[1:37:51] oh y'all got that same phone call oh my
[1:38:00] goodness perfect love will never take
[1:38:03] away the fear from a root
[1:38:07] canal you understand what I'm saying
[1:38:10] what is it about it that our bodies will
[1:38:13] react whenever we hear certain diagnosis
[1:38:16] that the doctors will say and a physical
[1:38:19] change will come over us
[1:38:21] in a
[1:38:25] moment oh Lord God help us
[1:38:29] father you see a True Believer in the
[1:38:31] Lord Jesus does not have to fear the
[1:38:35] past the
[1:38:37] present nor the future CU he took care
[1:38:41] of my past and he's with me here today
[1:38:44] so there for it makes me where I don't
[1:38:46] have to fear my
[1:38:47] future but there will always be these
[1:38:50] things around us now watch Paul in
[1:38:52] Romans 8:15 said for ye have not
[1:38:55] received the spirit of bondage again
[1:38:59] that's talking to Christians so you've
[1:39:01] not received the spirit of bondage again
[1:39:04] to fear the spirit of bondage again to
[1:39:08] fear so the word bondage is slavery the
[1:39:11] condition of a slave so why would we
[1:39:14] want to be free from the slavery of sin
[1:39:18] and then come under a so-called slavery
[1:39:21] under the name of
[1:39:23] Christianity to which we simply trade
[1:39:26] the type of fear that we have so it's
[1:39:29] the fear from the devil and we switch it
[1:39:31] to the fear of a God who has been
[1:39:35] painted To Us by preachers themselves
[1:39:38] that don't really love him right you see
[1:39:40] you watch a lot of preachers and they're
[1:39:42] constantly preaching under condemnation
[1:39:44] constantly preaching under hell I'll
[1:39:46] tell you what I found out through the
[1:39:47] years A lot of them guys they're
[1:39:49] preaching because that's where they live
[1:39:51] themselves they fear God they dread God
[1:39:54] they dread meeting God but let me just
[1:39:56] tell you in case you're wondering you're
[1:39:58] looking at a man today that does not
[1:39:59] fear meeting God I believe there's more
[1:40:02] people in this building that have the
[1:40:03] exact same thing I'm talking about I
[1:40:06] look forward to meeting my Lord Jesus
[1:40:09] I'm not expecting to be thrown into hell
[1:40:11] I'm not expecting to be beat or whipped
[1:40:14] I do not believe that because I am his
[1:40:17] son I am a part of his econom me oh
[1:40:21] brother Donnie does that make you live
[1:40:23] loose are you kidding me I want to live
[1:40:25] closer to him that I've ever lived in my
[1:40:28] entire life but I'm going to do it not
[1:40:30] because I'm afraid not because I'm
[1:40:33] scared I'm going to hell but I OE my
[1:40:36] whole heart I owe him my emotions I owe
[1:40:39] him everything about me he has been so
[1:40:43] good to me why I wouldn't I want to give
[1:40:46] him
[1:40:49] everything
[1:40:55] for ye have not received the spirit so
[1:40:58] you see there's a
[1:41:00] spirit that comes with
[1:41:03] bondage you have not received the spirit
[1:41:07] of bondage again to fear but ye have
[1:41:12] received the
[1:41:14] spirit of
[1:41:17] adoption wow how different the spirit of
[1:41:21] adoption is the feeling of affection
[1:41:26] Love In other words I'll say it in a way
[1:41:29] so you can relate to it if God had a
[1:41:31] refrigerator your picture would be all
[1:41:34] over
[1:41:34] it y'all relate to that
[1:41:37] right he don't look at you and think how
[1:41:40] bad you are and how awful oh my brother
[1:41:42] Donnie all my mistake sh knows all of
[1:41:44] your mistakes but remember that's one of
[1:41:46] the reasons that he died remember the
[1:41:48] personal interview of sister Georgia
[1:41:50] Bruce but brother ROM I have so many
[1:41:52] things about me that I know that's right
[1:41:54] sister Georgie that's why Jesus died so
[1:41:58] your mistakes would not even be alloted
[1:42:00] to you come on somebody don't sit there
[1:42:03] and look at me blessed is the man that
[1:42:05] walketh not in the coun of the ungodly
[1:42:08] nor sth in the way of Sinners nor sth in
[1:42:10] the seat of the scornful that his
[1:42:12] Delight is in the law of the Lord in his
[1:42:15] law does he meditate both day and night
[1:42:18] he shall be like a tree planted by the
[1:42:20] river of the water his fruit shall not
[1:42:23] weather Hallelujah whatsoever he doth
[1:42:26] shall prosper but the ungodly are not so
[1:42:29] they are like the chaff which the Wind
[1:42:31] Drive us away you are blessed to love
[1:42:34] God you are blessed to have a desire to
[1:42:37] serve it you are blessed that you're not
[1:42:39] standing here today with a phobia in
[1:42:42] your heart against
[1:42:49] Jesus
[1:42:53] you see the spirit of adoption is the
[1:42:55] spirit of being
[1:42:58] accepted not the way you and I think of
[1:43:01] adoption that somebody goes down to an
[1:43:03] adoption center and they adopt somebody
[1:43:06] else's
[1:43:07] child but this is the placing of
[1:43:12] sons God didn't adopt you from the Devil
[1:43:15] the devil just had your body and God had
[1:43:17] your soul so it took you package deal
[1:43:22] away from the devil and filled you with
[1:43:24] a spirit of acceptance amen
[1:43:27] adoption whereby we cry father father or
[1:43:33] Abba
[1:43:35] Father notice he says in Ephesians 4:26
[1:43:40] be ye angry and sin not let not the sun
[1:43:43] go down upon your WRA neither give
[1:43:48] place to the devil
[1:43:51] Place room any portion or space marked
[1:43:57] off as it were from surrounding space an
[1:44:01] inhabited place so whenever you start to
[1:44:05] work
[1:44:06] tomorrow don't make give place in the
[1:44:10] passenger seat of your car for the devil
[1:44:13] well brother Donnie wasn't preaching
[1:44:15] about you you low down sorry dirt bag
[1:44:17] you you ain't good for nothing Jesus
[1:44:19] said devil out of here you ain't riding
[1:44:22] with me to work you ain't riding in my
[1:44:25] passenger seat you ain't riding in the
[1:44:27] back seat as a matter of fact you ain't
[1:44:29] even riding in the truck get out I'm not
[1:44:32] making no place that's what we need to
[1:44:34] do in our homes make no place for the
[1:44:37] devil in our home that's what we need to
[1:44:39] do in our church make no place for the
[1:44:42] devil we're not giving the devil a
[1:44:44] special seat upon the platform there
[1:44:47] ain't no seats in the mezzanine that
[1:44:49] we're reserving for for demons as a
[1:44:51] matter of fact if there's any still left
[1:44:53] in here get out of here get out of here
[1:44:57] you Devils of Darkness you Devils of
[1:45:00] sickness were not given any place in our
[1:45:04] life for Satan and his
[1:45:06] [Applause]
[1:45:12] kingdom
[1:45:17] Hallelujah let me change
[1:45:19] now
[1:45:22] another right that we
[1:45:25] have as the people of
[1:45:28] God is a
[1:45:31] right to the
[1:45:34] mind of
[1:45:39] Christ a right to the mind of
[1:45:43] Christ what this in 1 Corinthians
[1:45:46] 2:16 for who has known the mind of the
[1:45:49] Lord now he asked a question for who
[1:45:53] hath known the mind of the
[1:45:55] Lord that he may instruct him
[1:46:00] but we have the mind of
[1:46:05] Christ so he ask the
[1:46:07] question you know if you've ever had
[1:46:09] many interviews with preachers you know
[1:46:10] that a lot of times preachers will
[1:46:12] answer your question with eight more
[1:46:16] questions well I'll ask you this and
[1:46:19] I'll ask you that so Paul here he asks
[1:46:22] the
[1:46:23] question and then he answers it in a
[1:46:25] very peculiar way for who has known the
[1:46:27] mind of the Lord that he may instruct
[1:46:28] him but we have the mind of
[1:46:33] Christ and the meaning of the word is
[1:46:36] understanding judging the capacity for
[1:46:40] Spiritual
[1:46:42] truths The Faculty of
[1:46:45] perceiving divine
[1:46:47] things of recognizing goodness
[1:46:51] and of hating
[1:46:53] evil I find this to be amazing because
[1:46:57] there are so many church
[1:46:59] people that do not have this
[1:47:03] mind cuz they cannot differentiate
[1:47:05] between something that is right and
[1:47:07] something that is wrong so one preacher
[1:47:09] will say you know this this this this
[1:47:11] this and this is right and then another
[1:47:13] one will say the exact opposite and then
[1:47:16] people sat there and think
[1:47:18] well which one we supposed to believe
[1:47:21] well I don't know what to believe well I
[1:47:22] was totally convinced that this and then
[1:47:24] I heard this man say something different
[1:47:26] now I'm just so confused I don't know
[1:47:28] what to believe and their whole life for
[1:47:31] many of them that's the way they are
[1:47:32] flip flop flip flop back forth back and
[1:47:36] forth and yet they carry Bibles they've
[1:47:39] got books they got the message on their
[1:47:40] phone and they still don't know what to
[1:47:42] don't you understand what's missing it's
[1:47:45] the
[1:47:46] newos of Christ the Mind The Faculty
[1:47:50] which can only come by a new birth to be
[1:47:53] able to look at something that looks
[1:47:55] identical can look like an identical
[1:47:59] twin but the mind of Christ can
[1:48:02] differentiate between the two and a
[1:48:04] person trying to use their Sensations or
[1:48:06] their emotions or whatever or well I I
[1:48:08] just patronized this brother he's always
[1:48:10] been one of my favorites and I really
[1:48:11] like this guy but someone with the mind
[1:48:14] of Christ has the faculty which is
[1:48:17] beyond thems to discern between right
[1:48:20] and wrong and yet you look at it and it
[1:48:22] might look
[1:48:24] identical it may feel right it may seem
[1:48:29] right it may look right but the mind of
[1:48:33] Christ in you says watch that they're
[1:48:37] leaving out this
[1:48:38] word then they'll leave out this one
[1:48:41] then they'll leave out that
[1:48:42] one praise the Lord but we have the mind
[1:48:47] if you want to notice this that Paul it
[1:48:49] says we have
[1:48:50] so already in the first church age now
[1:48:53] remember this was the alpha bride so God
[1:48:55] had started doing what he desired to do
[1:48:57] in the Old Testament but the law would
[1:48:58] not allow it and that was the spirit of
[1:49:00] God to come inside not only the prophets
[1:49:03] but the mystical body of the Believers
[1:49:05] so they had received and element of them
[1:49:08] had received the mind of Christ so it's
[1:49:11] the power of considering and judging
[1:49:14] soberly
[1:49:16] calmly and
[1:49:19] impartially so in other words they won't
[1:49:21] judge a situation if it's you know the
[1:49:23] pastor's pet then the pastor's pet gets
[1:49:27] special conditions and you know and then
[1:49:30] everybody else you know this no the mind
[1:49:32] of Christ never does that and everybody
[1:49:34] said amen a particular mode of thinking
[1:49:38] and judging thoughts feelings purposes
[1:49:42] and desires so he has endowed those of
[1:49:45] us that have received the token life
[1:49:47] inside of our soul he has endowed us
[1:49:49] with his own personal ability listen now
[1:49:53] his own personal ability to be able to
[1:49:59] discern praise be to
[1:50:02] God so we're capable of separating
[1:50:07] truth from
[1:50:12] error thank you
[1:50:15] Jesus notice again in Philippians 2:5
[1:50:18] the aspects of the
[1:50:20] mind let this
[1:50:22] mind same English word but a different
[1:50:25] Greek word altogether let this mind be
[1:50:29] in you for
[1:50:30] oal which was also in Christ
[1:50:33] Jesus now look at the meaning of the
[1:50:35] word here to have an opinion of oneself
[1:50:40] God knows we all have
[1:50:45] that and most of us
[1:50:49] wrong now let this mind be in you to
[1:50:54] have an opinion of oneself to think of
[1:50:58] oneself to be modest not let one's
[1:51:02] opinion though
[1:51:04] just of himself exceed the
[1:51:08] bounds of
[1:51:12] modesty now this was the
[1:51:15] mind that was in Christ Jesus now I want
[1:51:17] you to notice how Paul says this let or
[1:51:20] allow you see this is something that
[1:51:22] will not automatically just blow out of
[1:51:25] you but we must allow God through this
[1:51:29] mind of Christ that no matter what God
[1:51:33] ever does through us how great the work
[1:51:35] God may be that he uses us for but we
[1:51:38] not the people around us but us keep it
[1:51:42] in the bounds of
[1:51:46] modesty that's right and somebody
[1:51:48] said
[1:51:51] yeah who being in the Amor of
[1:51:56] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:52:01] with
[1:52:02] God now who was he the word the
[1:52:06] Amor of God and he thought it not
[1:52:10] robbery to be equal with God though he
[1:52:13] was God in a human body but he did not
[1:52:16] consider it robbery which is to take
[1:52:19] something away from God he looked at it
[1:52:22] as an exact transfer of
[1:52:26] riches it was not robbery for him to say
[1:52:30] when you have seen me you have seen the
[1:52:34] father that's right that was not
[1:52:37] robbery now for a person to say I'm a
[1:52:40] Child of God I'm this and that and the
[1:52:41] other and they're not living a life
[1:52:43] that's worthy of a child of God they
[1:52:45] just robbed the Christian
[1:52:47] title but Jesus didn't not look at it as
[1:52:50] robbery to say I am the way I am the
[1:52:54] truth I am the life and no man can come
[1:52:57] to the father but by me Lord Phillip
[1:53:01] said Lord show us the Father and Jesus
[1:53:04] saith unto them Phillip hast thou been
[1:53:06] with me so long a time and don't know
[1:53:09] who I am it was not
[1:53:14] robbery but yet he was
[1:53:18] God but in supreme authority of his
[1:53:23] position he never acted like he was
[1:53:27] right why he lived beneath his position
[1:53:31] how did he do that Harry it was a
[1:53:33] mindset for the service that was
[1:53:38] required he must condem
[1:53:41] send you see for him to do this when his
[1:53:45] bride
[1:53:47] comes Hallelujah for if we believe that
[1:53:51] Jesus died and rose again them which
[1:53:53] sleep in Jesus will God also bring with
[1:53:56] him when he
[1:53:57] comes when Jesus comes in the Rapture it
[1:54:02] will not be an act of condensation him
[1:54:05] humbling himself
[1:54:07] again you're talking about
[1:54:10] glory and robes and
[1:54:14] diadems and
[1:54:16] crowns why now will be the time but when
[1:54:20] he's on Earth he needed this
[1:54:27] mindset praise
[1:54:29] God who being in the form of God thought
[1:54:32] it not robbery to be equal with God but
[1:54:35] made
[1:54:36] him of
[1:54:39] no
[1:54:41] reputation and took upon him the form of
[1:54:44] a Ser don't you see what this mind is
[1:54:47] let this mind be in use so this mind
[1:54:50] is the ability to self
[1:54:55] empty
[1:54:57] kosis this is what God did he emptied
[1:54:59] himself then the Lord Jesus emptied
[1:55:03] himself and In The Garden of Gethsemane
[1:55:05] the anointing left him and he did not
[1:55:08] die with the
[1:55:10] anointing he died without
[1:55:13] it this is how he coulds say my God my
[1:55:15] God why H Thou forsaken
[1:55:18] me so the self emptying is the mind that
[1:55:23] every member of the Bride not just
[1:55:25] preachers we must have self emptying
[1:55:29] denying ourself let this mind be in you
[1:55:33] the mind of
[1:55:36] self-emptying instead of self-
[1:55:38] evaluation Bo I'll tell you one thing I
[1:55:40] guess I'm just about the greatest
[1:55:41] preacher on the message well I reckon
[1:55:43] I'm just about the greatest singer there
[1:55:44] ever was I've written more songs than
[1:55:45] anybody in the message as far as I know
[1:55:47] and if you don't believe I am just ask
[1:55:48] me I'll tell you I am
[1:55:50] I'll tell you that right now if you want
[1:55:51] to know who it is glory to God I'll tell
[1:55:52] you who it is with all
[1:55:55] humility oh my you
[1:55:58] skunk come on now that
[1:56:02] stinks that's not
[1:56:04] humility people Saints are humble
[1:56:06] because they say they
[1:56:08] are I am so
[1:56:12] humble I'm so
[1:56:18] humble
[1:56:21] how many of us in our church today have
[1:56:24] the
[1:56:26] mind of self
[1:56:33] emptying if we would be looking for
[1:56:35] people here in the church today that
[1:56:36] every other service your name would be
[1:56:37] mentioned either by me or somebody else
[1:56:40] or you would be recognized for this or
[1:56:41] recognized for that or this or that or
[1:56:43] the other wonder how many of us would
[1:56:45] say that's what I read out
[1:56:47] tell but if God needed somebody and they
[1:56:50] pulled down on the parking lot and they
[1:56:51] seen a little chewing gum rapper laying
[1:56:52] there said who done that I'm going to
[1:56:54] stop my car and pick that
[1:56:56] up people all the time coming out here
[1:56:59] on the road and throwing out their beer
[1:57:00] cans and their beer bottles and all that
[1:57:02] sort of thing anybody willing to stop
[1:57:04] out there pick any that stuff
[1:57:09] up brother Donnie how dare you you would
[1:57:13] ask me to pick up a Coke can I do
[1:57:17] amen you would pick c a french fry box I
[1:57:21] do I don't think it's becoming for our
[1:57:24] place to look like this that's right we
[1:57:26] are so blessed to have such a facility I
[1:57:29] don't want us to take advantage of it I
[1:57:31] don't want us to feel like we can run it
[1:57:33] down and treat it like I don't know what
[1:57:35] we ought to be so happy our birthday
[1:57:38] just last week been here for a year we
[1:57:40] ought to be so grateful to God we ought
[1:57:43] to every time we come into this place I
[1:57:45] come over here sometimes multiple times
[1:57:46] during the week sometimes it hits me
[1:57:48] when I pull in some time when I pull out
[1:57:50] and I'll stop and get out of my vehicle
[1:57:52] and look back and say Lord I just can't
[1:57:53] hardly believe it I just can't hardly
[1:57:55] believe it you've given us such a nice
[1:57:57] place to worship such a nice place for
[1:58:00] all of our activities and all that I am
[1:58:02] so grateful to God to have it today I am
[1:58:06] grateful no I don't deserve it no you
[1:58:09] don't deserve it no we do not deserve
[1:58:12] any of it but God's giv it to
[1:58:14] [Applause]
[1:58:17] us oh my
[1:58:22] y'all pray fast now I'll
[1:58:24] hurry
[1:58:27] maybe you see our
[1:58:30] Outlook determines our
[1:58:34] outcome our attitude will determ our
[1:58:40] altitude people's altitude toward Christ
[1:58:43] the word will determine they will not be
[1:58:46] able to attain a Rapture altitude
[1:58:52] notice in this sermon the angel of God
[1:58:54] I'll close here shortly it's the mind of
[1:58:57] Christ and the human being has the
[1:59:02] privilege to enter
[1:59:04] in and
[1:59:07] know the mind of Christ
[1:59:11] Hallelujah I want you to look at the day
[1:59:13] of the sermon
[1:59:18] 3448
[1:59:21] now some of y'all may think I'm absolute
[1:59:22] nuts preaching this in 2024 can you
[1:59:24] imagine what they thought about him
[1:59:26] preaching this in
[1:59:29] 1948 when they're this is Pentecost of
[1:59:32] course Pentecost is wide open they're
[1:59:34] pushing gifts shouting running jumping
[1:59:36] you know all that sort of thing nothing
[1:59:37] wrong with that long as the presence of
[1:59:38] God is inoc is decent in order thank God
[1:59:40] for it but how weird and strange this
[1:59:43] must have seen when all these things are
[1:59:45] going on and he's preaching about the
[1:59:48] mind of Christ what a reality to dwell
[1:59:51] in the channel of Christ we unworthy
[1:59:54] Mortals have been brought in to be Sons
[1:59:56] and Daughters of God to be fellow
[2:00:00] citizens again he says you can't have
[2:00:02] the mind of Christ and the mind of the
[2:00:04] world the same time you can't be in your
[2:00:06] way and God's way at the same time you
[2:00:09] have to get out of your own way to let
[2:00:11] God have his way Lord help us Lord help
[2:00:14] us that's the only way you're ever going
[2:00:16] to do anything you got to get away from
[2:00:18] your own thoughts your own reasons don't
[2:00:21] try to reason just
[2:00:23] believe let's stand I'll read you this
[2:00:25] other one while you rest
[2:00:29] yourself and we have faith in our
[2:00:33] heart the faith of God in our
[2:00:38] heart and can see it
[2:00:40] clear and it becomes a
[2:00:43] Fai and then we speak
[2:00:47] it and it comes into
[2:00:52] existence because the mind of
[2:00:55] Christ is in the
[2:00:57] man that's what makes healings and so
[2:01:00] forth when you get that perfect
[2:01:03] Revelation just what you're doing then
[2:01:06] you know how to
[2:01:11] walk let me look at this again it
[2:01:13] becomes a faith then we speak it and it
[2:01:16] comes into existence the same thing
[2:01:19] because the mind of
[2:01:21] Christ is in the
[2:01:24] man maybe some of y'all are battleing
[2:01:26] things in your life and you come up for
[2:01:29] me to pray for you brother Daryl to pray
[2:01:31] for brother Joel brother Jonathan these
[2:01:33] are the minister Brothers here brother
[2:01:35] Michael the others visit the ministers
[2:01:37] that would
[2:01:39] come they said well I went up for prayer
[2:01:41] it didn't happen I asked God that didn't
[2:01:44] happen I
[2:01:47] wonder if God wants some of of
[2:01:50] us to be able to let this mind be in us
[2:01:53] and he will take your own
[2:01:56] mouth and you will say to that besetting
[2:02:01] sin leave
[2:02:03] me in the name of
[2:02:07] Jesus you know I'm here to help you you
[2:02:09] know I would pray for you till I fell
[2:02:12] flat on the floor with all my strengths
[2:02:15] gone and I'm here to do everything I can
[2:02:18] to help you
[2:02:19] but I want us and our church to come to
[2:02:23] a place to where we realize God don't
[2:02:26] want the emphasis just to be on the
[2:02:29] preacher the
[2:02:31] pastor it's a body
[2:02:38] move so I'll go back to this elbow
[2:02:41] that's
[2:02:45] itching now my head could scratch it but
[2:02:48] but it's going to be a might
[2:02:50] awkward and y'all going to laugh at me
[2:02:52] if I do
[2:02:54] it or I can take a part that's been
[2:02:59] appropriated to be more beneficial I've
[2:03:02] been told by a couple of Brothers but I
[2:03:03] was told about it the first time from
[2:03:05] Brother Perry
[2:03:07] green he was talking about brother
[2:03:09] brandom talking about the fivefold
[2:03:12] ministry and he named each one of these
[2:03:14] fingers you know what they
[2:03:16] were and he said that this
[2:03:19] was the
[2:03:20] prophet and he said notice brother Perry
[2:03:23] how the prophet can work with the pastor
[2:03:26] the Evangelist the
[2:03:28] teacher it it amazing you try to you
[2:03:31] know try to it's it's hard to do don't
[2:03:35] do it now but do them when you get home
[2:03:36] later look how hard it can be sometimes
[2:03:38] getting this little
[2:03:40] guy but notice how the prophet can work
[2:03:43] with all them other folks so
[2:03:45] smoothly so there ain't going to be one
[2:03:48] Pastor in the message that everybody's
[2:03:49] going to hover around there ain't going
[2:03:51] to be one
[2:03:53] evangelist come on somebody there's only
[2:03:56] one man really that all the bride is
[2:03:59] going to be under his headship and his
[2:04:03] position that's right and all the rest
[2:04:05] of them will work like this until they
[2:04:07] get bigheaded and think they don't need
[2:04:08] him no more I hope we never get that way
[2:04:11] in our
[2:04:12] church where God's message through his
[2:04:14] Prophet can always be so alive
[2:04:19] and our
[2:04:20] hearts come me bow our
[2:04:28] heads I want each of you
[2:04:33] today to look at your life as a man a
[2:04:37] woman a young man a young
[2:04:40] sister just asking
[2:04:42] Lord please help me
[2:04:46] today I I need more of that love that I
[2:04:49] heard preached about
[2:04:51] today I need it to mature in me and when
[2:04:55] we say
[2:04:56] more I'm not sure so much that it's more
[2:04:59] in
[2:05:00] quantity as it is just more
[2:05:03] mature we're thinking well more and more
[2:05:06] and more means something other than what
[2:05:08] you have but I'm wondering sometimes if
[2:05:11] it's not it's there it's just in the
[2:05:13] stage that it needs to grow
[2:05:16] up and the Lord can use use
[2:05:19] it praise the
[2:05:23] Lord heavenly father as we have our
[2:05:25] heads bowed to the dust of the Earth
[2:05:28] from whence we were
[2:05:29] taken and one day knowing that if you
[2:05:32] don't change us we'll go back to that
[2:05:37] dust we have this petition in our heart
[2:05:39] today
[2:05:41] Lord that we can be what we have
[2:05:44] heard I believe there's people here
[2:05:47] today and no doubt people that have
[2:05:49] streamed the service and many of them
[2:05:52] have grown and grown and
[2:05:56] their in
[2:05:57] a matured state in their walk and their
[2:06:00] life and their love and their faith and
[2:06:03] their Temperance and their
[2:06:05] Joy but Lord they just feel like they
[2:06:08] need just a little bit more
[2:06:11] growth they're almost at the
[2:06:14] top maybe there's some that's just
[2:06:16] starting at the very bottom and they
[2:06:18] feel
[2:06:19] they need so much and lack so much but
[2:06:23] this is one thing we so love about you
[2:06:25] you can take all of us at different
[2:06:26] levels and make each one of us feel
[2:06:29] welcome at your table there's people
[2:06:31] here that's been serving you for decades
[2:06:33] after
[2:06:35] decades but you don't love them any more
[2:06:37] than you do that one that just got saved
[2:06:39] a few weeks ago or a few nights
[2:06:43] ago Lord Jesus I pray you would help us
[2:06:46] to have your mind
[2:06:49] for our
[2:06:51] church what we
[2:06:53] think you want our church to become no
[2:06:56] doubt every person here would have their
[2:06:57] idea and their opinion well I I I
[2:07:00] believe God would want our church to be
[2:07:02] this or do that or do this certain thing
[2:07:04] or have this sort of Outreach this way
[2:07:06] and that way Lord I I just pray You'
[2:07:08] help all of us father that we can find
[2:07:11] your mind for our
[2:07:14] church not only our
[2:07:16] church but our marriage
[2:07:19] our homes our
[2:07:22] families what's your mind
[2:07:25] Lord father in the last few
[2:07:28] years several of our
[2:07:31] Saints in 2013 I think sister barbar

[2:07:38] been here I've buried 144 people I
[2:07:41] believe it was since I've been here
[2:07:45] 2013 13 in one year
[2:07:49] that's left behind widows
[2:07:54] widowers some daughters that are
[2:07:58] motherless some boys that might be
[2:08:01] motherless maybe they feel all alone and
[2:08:04] lost
[2:08:05] today they don't know what the rest of
[2:08:07] their
[2:08:08] life is to
[2:08:11] be they needs your mind
[2:08:13] Lord so what about our
[2:08:17] sisters losing their husbands to covid
[2:08:20] or to cancer or whatever it would
[2:08:23] be a real daughter of God that focuses
[2:08:26] so much of our life around her husband
[2:08:28] and then all of a sudden he's
[2:08:31] gone what do they do with the rest of

[2:13:46] immediately
[2:13:48] these signs shall
[2:13:50] follow them not just the
[2:13:55] preachers let's pray for one
[2:14:02] another Heavenly
[2:14:05] Father our brothers and sisters have
[2:14:07] their hands one upon the other here
[2:14:09] today
[2:14:11] Lord I've seen one Widow sister reach
[2:14:13] over and take hold of the hand of
[2:14:16] another Widow sister they share
[2:14:18] something in common
[2:14:20] Lord their husbands been taken from them
[2:14:23] and no doubt they never thought it would
[2:14:25] ever
[2:14:26] happen looking for the remaining portion
[2:14:28] of their life what do they do they no
[2:14:31] longer fit with married couples
[2:14:34] really married couples will ask them to
[2:14:36] go out and they feel awkward and out of
[2:14:39] place would you help them
[2:14:43] Jesus young people standing here Lord
[2:14:45] maybe they're at that awkward stage in
[2:14:47] their life
[2:14:49] trying to find what you want them to
[2:14:51] be maybe there's ministers here today
[2:14:54] Lord that'll hear this and they're
[2:14:56] seeking your wisdom about a pivotable
[2:14:59] pivotal rather turning spot in their
[2:15:01] life and they don't know what to
[2:15:03] do people think preachers have all the
[2:15:05] answers or if they only knew the truth
[2:15:07] of it we struggled as much or more than
[2:15:09] they do trying to find direction
[2:15:12] sometime for our lives and if a preacher
[2:15:15] makes a mistake it's public so everybody
[2:15:19] can see it and criticize
[2:15:21] him Lord as preachers we need your
[2:15:25] leadership Lord I pray that every man of
[2:15:27] God
[2:15:28] that's called to preach this word may
[2:15:32] they realize what an awesome
[2:15:33] responsibility they have especially
[2:15:36] those of us who stream our services and
[2:15:38] stream our
[2:15:40] churches we have an international
[2:15:42] audience and sometimes our influence
[2:15:44] overlaps from one to another and there's
[2:15:46] people here I know that'll listen to
[2:15:48] this preacher and that preacher and
[2:15:50] another
[2:15:51] preacher and then if they hear
[2:15:53] conflicting things they don't know what
[2:15:54] to say they don't know what to
[2:15:56] believe help all of those ministers who
[2:15:59] stream and do all of that to understand
[2:16:02] the responsibility that they have in
[2:16:05] affecting other
[2:16:07] sheep Lord Jesus we all need your mind
[2:16:12] father how will it be that you'll ever
[2:16:15] get a group of people together on the
[2:16:17] Earth
[2:16:18] in one mind for the
[2:16:22] Rapture the Bible tells us that they
[2:16:24] were in one place and in one Accord
[2:16:28] there on the day of Pentecost and they'
[2:16:30] been discussing and debating and going
[2:16:31] through this and that and the other for
[2:16:33] several days now but finally they
[2:16:36] arrived and one
[2:16:38] Accord no doubt we'll always have
[2:16:40] differences father but for that which is
[2:16:43] needful for us as your people would you
[2:16:47] sweep the world Lord God and bring the
[2:16:50] preachers if the preachers can't grow up
[2:16:53] and become
[2:16:54] mature how can the
[2:16:57] Sheep if the preachers cannot grow up
[2:17:00] and be what you've called us to be
[2:17:02] instead of trying to carve out our
[2:17:04] little niche here and our little niche
[2:17:06] there help us Lord God to lead your
[2:17:09] people together in the unity of the
[2:17:12] facei and the knowledge of the Son of
[2:17:16] God great it Lord Lord
