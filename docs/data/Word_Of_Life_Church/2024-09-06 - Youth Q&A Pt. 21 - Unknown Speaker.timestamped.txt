[25:32] going to keep him in prayer and just
[25:33] pull as he brings forth the word looking
[25:35] forward to
[25:44] it our hearts to be able to see him and
[25:50] understand him
[25:52] better we know that we can only be able
[25:55] to really serve him with all the
[25:57] sincerity of our hearts is when we know
[26:01] more about him and understand his
[26:04] character and his nature what he wants
[26:07] of us and sometimes why he wants it
[26:10] sometimes he's gracious to us and lets
[26:12] us know I want it this way because
[26:14] because because other times he doesn't
[26:17] he just tells us and he wants us to
[26:18] trust him but I'm so grateful that he's
[26:22] allowed us this privilege again um we'll
[26:25] pick up on the last question that we had
[26:28] and I'm sorry that we had to cancel a
[26:30] couple and I wasn't able to be
[26:32] here um but we'll resume where we were
[26:37] can you explain why brother brandham is
[26:40] a Vindicated prophet and why the message
[26:43] is correct I have a difficult time
[26:48] speaking to why I believe what I believe
[26:52] we're going to pray how many have a need
[26:54] on your heart tonight a request all
[26:57] right Lord Jesus we've gathered here
[26:59] again
[27:00] tonight for the opportunity and for the
[27:03] privilege that's been given to us at
[27:05] hand and we're coming with Thanksgiving
[27:08] first of all that we have this
[27:11] opportunity Lord God we realize that we
[27:14] have many brothers and sisters around
[27:16] the world they cannot meet on Wednesday
[27:19] night Thursday night they have to rent a
[27:21] school they have to hire a facility as
[27:25] they call it they can only get that fac
[27:28] facility whenever it's available what
[27:30] they would give to be able to meet on
[27:33] any given night of the week and we want
[27:36] you to know we are grateful for that
[27:38] opportunity we don't want to come to
[27:41] this place that you've given us and just
[27:43] say well so what it's this is way
[27:45] everybody does but in reality it's not
[27:48] many of your children Lord God they
[27:51] don't even have a church to go to they
[27:53] live here and there and there and miles
[27:55] away from a church I get emails from
[27:58] them all the time of people from around
[28:01] the world that would just love to come
[28:03] and make a visit just to be in the house
[28:05] of God so I pray that we wouldn't take
[28:08] it for granted Lord help me tonight Lord
[28:11] Jesus that I can get out of the way this
[28:13] is an important question for us and we
[28:16] seek understanding from you speak to us
[28:19] tonight father we pray in the name of
[28:22] Jesus amen God bless you you can be be
[28:25] seated
[28:29] to us um looking at prophets and talking
[28:33] about prophets Is Not Unusual it's um
[28:37] it's very normal to us to probably lots
[28:41] of Christians it would be one of the
[28:43] biggest stumbling blocks that they would
[28:46] hear um I'm sure that you've noticed it
[28:49] since we've been in here over a year now
[28:52] in February that we've had so many
[28:55] visitors that have come through I
[28:57] figured it would be that way people just
[28:59] curious trying to figure out who we are
[29:02] what we are they've heard all kinds of
[29:04] things about us so they're going to come
[29:05] and check us out and some come one time
[29:08] they never come back some come two or
[29:10] three times they never come back but
[29:12] it's always amazing to me that whenever
[29:14] you go to preach the message and then if
[29:16] we'll throw a quote up on the screen sh
[29:19] behind me I've seen several of those
[29:21] people in the year and half whatever it
[29:24] is that we've been here that whenever
[29:25] you go to doing that they get to a
[29:27] little pocket book and their song book
[29:29] and whatever and hit that door they're
[29:31] out of here they think oh my goodness
[29:33] what kind of church is this but I try to
[29:36] understand you know where they're coming
[29:38] from and yet many of the churches where
[29:40] they've gone to uh you can hear radio
[29:43] preachers do it all the time television
[29:44] preachers they'll quote from Charles
[29:46] Spurgeon they'll quote from M from Moody
[29:49] they'll quote from all types of other
[29:51] men why because they had some good
[29:53] things to say but I guess I don't
[29:56] understand why we're so weird when
[29:58] whenever we quote from it and we're
[29:59] considered a cult and yet if you would
[30:02] strip a lot of men's other men's sayings
[30:06] out of the preachers uh sermons a lot of
[30:08] the modern day preachers you'd be
[30:10] surprised of how little that they
[30:12] actually come up on their own the
[30:14] difference between us and Them is we're
[30:15] just honest where we get it at so we
[30:18] want to point you back in that direction
[30:20] but for the sake of this question
[30:22] tonight um I I've chosen not to U bring
[30:26] you any quotes we want to be able to go
[30:29] directly to the scripture and we've said
[30:31] it before that what we believe is based
[30:34] from the Bible we do not believe that
[30:36] brother random come to replace our Bible
[30:38] but he come to make our Bible so real
[30:42] that when we read our Bible it just
[30:44] means so much more to us through the
[30:47] enlightenment of this day so first of
[30:50] all we'd like to read tonight in 1st
[30:52] Samuel 3:1 with a saying that is is very
[30:56] common to us but might be un ual to
[30:58] others and that is that the word came to
[31:02] the prophets now Prophet is totally
[31:04] different than somebody like me brother
[31:06] Joe any other evangelist Pastor teacher
[31:09] missionary whatever it is a prophet has
[31:11] several different things about him that
[31:13] is so unique this is during the time
[31:16] frame when Eli is the priest Eli has
[31:20] become old and he's compromised as far
[31:23] as with his sons his sons are they're
[31:26] living terrible lives lives and the
[31:29] people of Israel know that they're not
[31:31] living right they're they're swindling
[31:33] money they're just doing all kinds of
[31:35] things and the child Samuel ministered
[31:38] unto the Lord before Eli What A peculiar
[31:42] statement and the word of the Lord was
[31:47] precious in those days the word of the
[31:51] Lord was precious in those days and this
[31:55] is the reason why there was was no open
[32:01] Vision now remember this is after of
[32:04] course Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph Moses
[32:08] they have the Torah the first five books
[32:11] of Moses the pente they have uh some of
[32:14] the the other writings there so why
[32:18] would the writer here of Samuel say the
[32:20] word of the Lord was precious in those
[32:23] days well of course the Torah was
[32:24] precious Genesis Exodus Leviticus or
[32:27] numbers other Leviticus and Deuteronomy
[32:29] so it would have been precious but why
[32:31] does he use the words open Vision now
[32:35] the word open the Hebrew word simply
[32:38] means a clearer understanding so the
[32:41] word was precious but it had been quite
[32:44] a span of time since there had been a
[32:47] prophet on the earth look with me at the
[32:49] word vision and it's a caon which means
[32:53] vision and it can have several different
[32:55] meanings the first one is in an estatic
[32:59] state so for those of you that were here
[33:01] last night and I was going through that
[33:02] about the spoken words Original Seed and
[33:04] brother Brandon was preaching and while
[33:06] he's preaching the vision of what he was
[33:08] talking about actually happened right
[33:10] before his eyes and he got beside
[33:13] himself when you go back and listen to
[33:14] it he was just beside himself and he had
[33:16] to kind of come back and regroup a
[33:18] little bit because he was he was
[33:20] changing Dimensions while it was going
[33:22] on so this is one of the meanings of
[33:24] vision in a static state or it is an
[33:29] oracle or a prophecy or a Divine
[33:34] communication so now they had the the
[33:37] word on on the skins and they had no
[33:41] doubt people that was talking about it
[33:43] it wasn't that they didn't have the book
[33:45] and and that they never read it they did
[33:48] but the problem was there was no open
[33:52] Vision so there was no one there now
[33:54] there were teachers of the written word
[33:57] there were preachers probably that would
[33:59] go about talk about how great it was how
[34:02] wonderful it was but there was no one
[34:04] there that could be able to see an open
[34:08] Vision now if God had something new to
[34:11] say there was no one there to catch it
[34:14] without a prophet now God could have had
[34:16] the Old Testament and the New Testament
[34:19] all written by Moses if that's what he
[34:22] wanted to do but God chose to divide his
[34:25] Revelation and what he would give to to
[34:27] the people down Through the Ages and he
[34:30] would let it out in increments so God
[34:33] would let this be spoken and that spoken
[34:36] and another thing spoken but he chose
[34:38] his means of communication would not be
[34:41] priest it would not be pastors it would
[34:45] not be evangelists but it would be
[34:47] prophets that would have the ability to
[34:51] see an open Vision now does anybody here
[34:55] know how old Samuel was whenever they
[34:57] this happened to him
[35:01] 12 a 12year old
[35:06] boy but God had something he wanted to
[35:11] say now this is where we look at the
[35:13] need of a prophet and the majority of
[35:16] Christendom they look at oh we don't
[35:18] need no Prophet we've got the Bible well
[35:21] they had the first five books of Moses
[35:23] and part of the writings of the other
[35:25] brothers uh why in the world would they
[35:28] need a prophet because God had something
[35:31] else he wanted to say and that's where
[35:35] we look at it in this day that God had
[35:38] something that he wanted to say and so
[35:40] the message is not a com compendium it's
[35:43] not you know it's something that we type
[35:45] in like a Bible dictionary but it is a
[35:49] message that's why we call it the
[35:51] message God never intended for us to
[35:54] make a new denomination and call it the
[35:57] message so what is a message it was a
[35:59] message from the King and what was that
[36:03] message get back to the original word
[36:06] and expound more about mercy and blood I
[36:09] think when the Lord Jesus was here You'
[36:12] think if God had something that he
[36:15] wanted to say he would have said it all
[36:19] while the Incarnate Word was here but
[36:22] isn't it amazing that the Lord Jesus
[36:24] left many many things about the new test
[36:27] to a church to Paul to Peter to James to
[36:32] Luke well my goodness why did not the
[36:35] Lord God use his own human Temple and
[36:40] just say everything that he wanted to
[36:42] say that's not the way God does it God
[36:46] lets out his word in increments and he
[36:49] chooses the individual that he will use
[36:52] to do it through now watch in 2 Samuel
[36:56] 24: 11 for when David was up in the
[37:00] morning the word of the Lord came unto
[37:05] the prophet Gad David's
[37:09] sear so when David got up early in the
[37:12] morning the word of the Lord came the
[37:15] word of the Lord now what happened to
[37:18] Samuel you remember the story of course
[37:20] that whenever Samuel he heard the voice
[37:22] of God speaking to him he was not he was
[37:25] not aware of the voice of God so it goes
[37:26] to Eli and he wakes Eli up and he said
[37:29] you call for me he said no I didn't call
[37:31] for you go back to bed he goes back to
[37:34] bed and he hears the voice call his name
[37:37] so he goes back to Eli what do you want
[37:40] you call for me he said no I never call
[37:43] for you go back to bed but he said if
[37:46] you hear it speak the next
[37:49] time here am I my Lord speak
[37:53] respond so what did he do God came the
[37:56] third time
[37:58] and he called this young man's name and
[38:01] he said Lord here's your servant speak
[38:04] now the first words that he gets from
[38:06] God it's not a great word of salutation
[38:09] it's not a great word of comfort and God
[38:12] is going to bless Israel and God's going
[38:14] to do this anybody know what it was it
[38:17] was about the destruction of the House
[38:21] of Eli so the next morning Eli asked him
[38:24] he said did the Lord come to you he said
[38:26] yeah in other words as wiet I don't want
[38:29] to talk about it I I I don't want to say
[38:32] what the Lord said you imagine how hard
[38:33] that would be because his mother
[38:35] promised that she would give him to God
[38:37] so she brings him back to the house of
[38:40] God as a we a we child and he's been
[38:42] there for years of his life and Eli no
[38:45] doubt was a great mentor in his life and
[38:47] now he's got a message from God well why
[38:50] did God tell Moses that cuz Moses never
[38:52] wrote about Eli so God had a word a
[38:57] current current present tense word to
[39:00] say and there was no open Vision there
[39:03] was a gap now well couldn't God send an
[39:06] angel he could have if he wanted to but
[39:09] he chose men to be able to bring these
[39:12] sort of things you understand so you can
[39:14] see then the way that we look at the
[39:16] need of a prophet we follow this same
[39:19] Forum from the Old Testament right down
[39:21] to the new and to us it just makes
[39:23] perfect sense but for those outside of
[39:26] that because many of them are Tau well
[39:29] the law and the prophets are un to John
[39:32] they don't even know what that verse of
[39:33] scripture actually even means they're
[39:37] using that to try to prove that when the
[39:41] New Testament comes we don't even need
[39:43] no more
[39:45] prophets goes to show they haven't read
[39:47] their new testament very
[39:49] far now watch so when God had something
[39:52] to say the word of the Lord would come
[39:57] to these prophets now they were also
[39:59] called sear anybody know what that word
[40:01] means simply like what you would do you
[40:06] see so they were given this this synonym
[40:10] that would be in comparison comparable
[40:13] to a prophet which mean they saw so they
[40:17] were a Seer so they'd be standing right
[40:20] there just like I am here and all of a
[40:22] sudden they break into the fourth
[40:24] dimension and they're in another world
[40:26] and they're SA saying things they don't
[40:28] have a clue what they're even saying and
[40:30] they would come to them themselves and
[40:32] that's the part that was absolutely
[40:36] infallible because God had them so under
[40:39] his control it was impossible for them
[40:43] to say anything wrong and that's where
[40:46] again of course it this stumbles the
[40:48] people of this day now remember the
[40:49] prophet tells us in the church age book
[40:51] that there must be a need a return of
[40:54] the power of infallibility in the last
[40:58] day so if God was going to say something
[41:01] he would not use a man like Benny hen
[41:03] and Billy Grahams we looked at last
[41:05] night or Roberts God could not give if
[41:08] he had a word to say in this day he
[41:12] could not just use them what did they do
[41:14] they repeated the scriptures that was
[41:16] already there what do I preach I repeat
[41:19] the scriptures I repeat what the
[41:20] prophets preach why cuz I'm not a Seer
[41:24] I'm not a Seer and there's not another
[41:26] prophet major prophet after Malachi 4
[41:29] you've heard me say it for years there
[41:30] ain't no Malachi 4 and 5 and a half it's
[41:33] 4 and five and that's it now watch in
[41:36] First Kings chapter
[41:38] 16:7 also by the hand of the Prophet
[41:42] jahu the son of hananiah came the word
[41:47] of the Lord against basa and against his
[41:51] house even for all the evil that he had
[41:53] done in the sight of the Lord in
[41:56] provoking anger so now God had a new
[41:59] word and a lot of these words that God
[42:01] had it wasn't pleasant it was not things
[42:05] that the people wanted to hear so God
[42:07] had a word to speak how's God going to
[42:10] speak it he's got to have a Seer and
[42:13] that sear will get in the presence of
[42:15] God and God will drop that word down
[42:19] some of them as Jeremiah had a scribe
[42:21] called baroo and Jeremiah would go into
[42:23] this trance and these visions and maybe
[42:27] did not even know what he was saying so
[42:29] while he was there and his eyes are
[42:31] looking straight ahead and he's in this
[42:33] translation it must have been in in some
[42:35] ways kind of a spooky type of thing
[42:38] because it's like they were there but
[42:41] they were not there and a scribe would
[42:43] sit there and write down it shall come
[42:45] to pass on such and such and so and so
[42:48] and maybe the vision last 10 15 20
[42:51] minutes and then Jeremiah come out of
[42:54] the vision and it would leave him weak
[42:56] and he was just saying
[42:57] what what what happened what what what
[43:00] did I say Brook don't worry Prophet I
[43:04] wrote it down I wrote it down why God
[43:09] had something to say oh I'll tell you me
[43:12] going back and studying all this for
[43:13] this question it made me so appreciate a
[43:16] prophet of God in our day notice in
[43:19] Jeremiah chap
[43:21] 28:12 then the word of the Lord came
[43:25] unto Jeremiah the prophet after that
[43:29] hananiah the prophet had broke the Yoke
[43:33] from off the neck of the Prophet
[43:37] Jeremiah oh wow so now we got two
[43:41] prophets and they're saying the exact
[43:48] opposite so if you and I were living in
[43:50] that day how are we going to know which
[43:52] one's
[43:55] right so Hannah jumps up thus sayith the
[43:59] Lord boy this will happen and that'll
[44:00] happen Jeremiah comes into the court of
[44:03] the
[44:04] king he's made a
[44:06] Yol of
[44:09] wood he comes in Prophet you symbol so
[44:12] he comes in with his hands they'd cut it
[44:14] in half and they'd have a hole here and
[44:16] two holes over here and they put their
[44:18] hands and end around their neet and here
[44:20] he comes in and hanani runs over to him
[44:22] and say you're a
[44:24] liar you're a false prophet
[44:28] God that call these people boy you
[44:30] imagine him getting so excited and all
[44:32] riled up he jerked and grabbed a hold of
[44:34] that Yol and busted it all to
[44:38] pieces Jeremiah goes out and comes back
[44:41] in a little while later with an iron Yol
[44:46] on and he tells hananiah thus sayith the
[44:49] Lord because you have done what you have
[44:52] done you will
[44:54] die this year
[44:58] guess what he didn't live a year and six
[45:00] months he died that
[45:03] year now what hananiah said did not
[45:07] happen and it did not come to pass but
[45:11] Jeremiah Was A Vindicated Prophet
[45:14] Vindication what do we mean by that now
[45:16] remember Jeremiah most of the Old
[45:18] Testament prophets were not like Moses
[45:21] in the sense that they called for the
[45:23] Red Sea to open up and God created bread
[45:27] and and quail and all that no you
[45:30] wouldn't know those guys by those signs
[45:33] a few of them did signs but that was not
[45:35] the way you recognize it John the
[45:38] Baptist we have no record in the New
[45:40] Testament that John ever had one miracle
[45:43] in his
[45:45] ministry so how would we know them by
[45:49] the word that came out of their mouths
[45:52] so their identification and their
[45:54] Vindication see how blessed we are
[45:57] so can you imagine if we were living in
[45:59] the Old Testament and God would have
[46:01] sent us Jeremiah and Ezekiel and all
[46:05] those prophets we never saw no signs no
[46:08] wonders they never called nobody El and
[46:10] said your name is so and so you went to
[46:12] a doctor today and you saw this and all
[46:14] that you imagine how blessed we are that
[46:17] we not only have the Vindication of the
[46:18] word but we have these signs to be able
[46:21] to convince us hey children this is me
[46:25] so here two men rise up and what do they
[46:27] have both of them have
[46:30] words both of them have words so one
[46:33] saying one thing and the other one is
[46:35] saying exact opposite one says you'll go
[46:38] down into Babylon and you'll be there
[46:40] two years thus sayeth the
[46:43] Lord the other one says you won't be
[46:47] down there two years you'll be down
[46:49] there 70 years for it's thus sayith the
[46:54] Lord and here you and I are sitting
[46:56] there and we're
[46:57] thinking how am I supposed to know which
[47:01] one's
[47:02] right what if Jeremiah had signs and
[47:04] wonders and he'd turn his back to the
[47:07] audience and say there's a young girl
[47:09] sitting right back there she has on a
[47:10] blue shirt she went to work today her
[47:13] boss told her so and so would say oh my
[47:15] goodness oh my goodness and then that
[47:18] false prophet would stand up there well
[47:20] I can't do that I I don't know how to do
[47:23] that he ain't nothing but a witch he
[47:25] he's just a warlock and a wizard
[47:28] neither one of them had that so you're
[47:31] the
[47:32] congregation how you going to judge
[47:34] these
[47:35] guys God give us the pattern in
[47:38] Deuteronomy we'll get to it in a bit now
[47:41] watch Jeremiah
[47:42] 46:1 the word of the Lord which came to
[47:45] Jeremiah the prophet against the
[47:49] Gentiles now if you remembered or not
[47:52] but last time we spoke about this I told
[47:54] you that God whenever Israel became
[47:56] divided to Israel and Judah that it was
[47:59] even so that some of the prophets were
[48:01] sent to Israel only and some to Judah
[48:03] only but there were some of the Old
[48:06] Testament prophets which were sent to
[48:09] All Nations Jeremiah was one of them but
[48:13] now every Prophet was not sent to All
[48:16] Nations Elijah was one of them Jeremiah
[48:20] was one of them habac Obadiah Jonah many
[48:24] of those you know they had a dead
[48:26] designated area that they stayed in so
[48:29] you can see then why the spirit of
[48:31] Elijah must come in the last day why we
[48:35] needed a prophet that would not just be
[48:37] a prophet to the Jews only like Hosea
[48:41] was or Amos was or a prophet to just the
[48:45] Gentiles only but we needed the
[48:48] anointing of a prophet which would go
[48:51] across
[48:52] Multicultural
[48:54] multinationals that would be able to be
[48:56] a prophet to the entire world thank God
[48:59] for that notice again Jeremiah 471 the
[49:02] word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah
[49:04] the prophet against the Philistines
[49:08] before that Pharaoh smoked Gaza now you
[49:11] realize this is the same Gaza that
[49:14] they're fighting over today so Jeremiah
[49:18] Was Not only a prophet to the Jews he
[49:20] had the word of God to the Jews but also
[49:23] to the Gentiles also to the Philistines
[49:26] Daniel chapter 9:2 in the first year of
[49:29] his Reign I Daniel
[49:32] understood by
[49:35] books the number of the years whereof
[49:38] the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah
[49:41] the
[49:42] prophet So Daniel is amongst those that
[49:46] are brought into
[49:48] captivity and whenever he goes down
[49:51] there him and his brothers they take the
[49:55] books of Jeremiah now those books were
[50:00] two one of them is called The Book of
[50:03] Jeremiah and the other one is called
[50:06] Lamentations that one was written
[50:09] outside the city in a cave on the
[50:11] outside of Jerusalem when the children
[50:14] of Israel carried captivity as Jeremiah
[50:17] sets there they called him the weeping
[50:19] prophet so he's weeping as he watched
[50:22] his prophecy come to pass then that book
[50:25] is later carried down into the Captivity
[50:29] so decades go by and something begins to
[50:33] move on Daniel's heart and he begins to
[50:36] think now wait a minute did not Jeremiah
[50:40] prophesy that there would be a span of
[50:42] time so how was it that they knew the
[50:45] time was near by the books of a
[50:49] Vindicated Prophet you think you think
[50:53] it mattered to Daniel that people
[50:55] laughed at him
[50:57] because he was reading from the books of
[51:00] a prophet that other people said well
[51:03] that Man's dead well why in the world
[51:06] would you read the books from a dead man
[51:09] why in the world would you want to stand
[51:11] up there and address the congregation
[51:15] and read to them quotes and no doubt
[51:17] Daniel would when they would stand up
[51:19] and they would have prayer meetings and
[51:21] whatever that they would do and Daniel
[51:22] would stand up and say now look Saints I
[51:24] want to read to you today from the
[51:26] Prophet Jeremiah because the Prophet
[51:29] Jeremiah said this 65 years ago look
[51:33] we're close we're close how did he know
[51:36] they were close because he was reading
[51:40] from the books of the Prophet
[51:43] Jeremiah he understood by the number of
[51:46] the years whereof the word of the Lord
[51:48] came to Jeremiah the prophet so you see
[51:51] they could have searched and they could
[51:53] have looked
[51:54] diligently in Genesis
[51:57] Exodus numbers Leviticus Deuteronomy
[52:01] Joshua Judges and they would have not
[52:04] found out how long they were supposed to
[52:07] be there because God never told Moses he
[52:11] told
[52:12] Jeremiah so if you're going to be in
[52:14] tune with the hour you live you've got
[52:18] to find the right word for the age you
[52:21] live in now they could have said God
[52:24] told Moses this and God told Abraham
[52:26] that and God told Jo Jacob this and
[52:29] Joseph that and we could say Amen but
[52:32] we're down here in captivity what did
[52:35] God say about us well we've got to find
[52:38] a prophet who had the ability to have
[52:42] open
[52:43] vision and God would be able to give him
[52:46] a word for the day and hour We're living
[52:49] so you imagine how they felt when they
[52:50] would pick up this book of Jeremiah and
[52:53] they would say this is modern events
[52:57] made
[52:58] clear by
[53:01] prophecy and they say think of it Saints
[53:04] we're living in this day Jeremiah was
[53:07] done Dead and Gone we're living in this
[53:10] day of
[53:12] Prophecy oh praise the Lord ha guy
[53:16] chapter 1 verse one in the second year
[53:19] of Darius the king in the sixth month in
[53:23] the first day of the
[53:25] month name the word of the
[53:27] Lord B hagga the prophet un zerubabel
[53:33] the son of shatil governor of Judah unto
[53:37] Joshua the son of
[53:39] josc the high priest saying okay now
[53:44] let's go back let's go back to
[53:48] Jeremiah so God now had a word for who
[53:53] for
[53:54] zerubabel zerubba is going to be the
[53:57] governor where they're going back to
[54:00] rebuild the Temple so it's under the
[54:03] administration of zerubabel and
[54:06] Nehemiah so if they would search through
[54:09] all the books of Jeremiah and say God we
[54:12] need a word we need a word what do we do
[54:15] Lord what do we
[54:16] do they would not have found it cuz
[54:19] Jeremiah said you're going to go back
[54:21] you're going to go back you're going to
[54:22] go back
[54:28] so what do we do when we get back
[54:29] Jeremiah you're going to go back you're
[54:31] going to go
[54:34] back but God didn't tell them what to do
[54:37] once they got back why God had another
[54:40] increment of his word that he was going
[54:43] to give to a man who had the ability to
[54:46] have an open
[54:49] Vision to me this is so
[54:52] simple oh my Hagi chapter 2:10 in the
[54:56] four and 20th day of the ninth month in
[55:01] the second year of Darius came the word
[55:05] of the Lord by hagga the prophet saying
[55:11] now notice he has the word of the Lord
[55:13] in chapter one but now we're in chapter
[55:16] two some time has passed they've went
[55:19] through a lot of Trials went through a
[55:21] lot of difficulties now what do they
[55:23] need another word from God to tell them
[55:28] what to do with where they currently are
[55:31] I hope you understand what I'm fixing to
[55:33] say we God has so blessed us with a
[55:37] message in this hour brother Rob and I
[55:40] were telling about actually before we
[55:41] come over why was running a little bit
[55:43] late we was just talking about the word
[55:44] and how good it is and I I told him that
[55:47] I just got a a quote from a brother from
[55:49] India last week and this brother not a
[55:51] Ministry thing but he shares things with
[55:53] me and other brothers and he just loves
[55:55] to study the word
[55:56] and he he sent me this quote and
[55:58] whenever I opened it up in the email and
[56:01] there was there was three words in there
[56:04] in this quote I had just listened to
[56:07] this tape not long ago I have listened
[56:10] to it you know how many ever years that
[56:12] I've been in the message over and over
[56:15] again and whenever I saw those words in
[56:18] that quote it looked like they were that
[56:20] big I mean they just jumped right out at
[56:24] me and I said down and I started
[56:27] studying and the Lord give me the
[56:29] inspiration it was just like an
[56:32] explosion that was going on and I
[56:34] thought how could I have missed that
[56:38] that is so awesome that is so wonderful
[56:41] well now you see there is not another
[56:44] promise for another Prophet but God
[56:47] still releases what's been said in
[56:50] increments to us in the day we're living
[56:54] sometimes I hear preachers preach and
[56:56] I'm thinking why in the world where did
[56:59] they get that at how did I miss that I
[57:01] just listened to that tape last week you
[57:03] see what God does god holds back the
[57:06] full inspiration from this prophetic
[57:09] message and he gives it to us when we
[57:12] need it and then your needs and your
[57:14] needs and your needs and Men of God will
[57:16] be inspired and they'll catch the mind
[57:19] of the Lord and they'll be listening to
[57:21] a tape reading their Bible and all of a
[57:23] sudden oh my goodness oh praise the Lord
[57:25] Praise the Lord what is it the same
[57:28] spirit of God giving us the increment of
[57:31] the word of what we need for where we
[57:33] are how mindful he is of us now watch
[57:37] Zechariah 1 verse one in the eighth
[57:40] month in the second year of
[57:43] Darius now catch this so here we have
[57:47] hagga which spoke in the 4 and 20th day
[57:50] in the ninth month in the second year of
[57:53] Darius and yet we have Zach arah in the
[57:57] eighth month in the second year of
[57:59] Darius came the word of the Lord unto
[58:03] Zachariah so here we've got two prophets
[58:06] now and the word coming to them about
[58:08] different things the son of beiia the
[58:11] son of IDU the prophet so watch how the
[58:15] word comes so it wasn't like a group of
[58:17] people got together and they said what
[58:19] do y'all saying don't you think we need
[58:20] to make a move of God what do you say
[58:22] what should we call ourselves and how
[58:24] should we dress and how should we do
[58:26] this and what will be our agenda no no
[58:29] that that's never the way that God did
[58:30] it through a group of people but God
[58:33] used one man and that one man would
[58:35] bring the word of God and that time
[58:38] frame that he was in now there was a
[58:39] time when there was some Minor Prophets
[58:41] and they would overlap each other though
[58:43] one might be in Judah and the other
[58:45] might be in Israel and God had something
[58:48] to say so he would use what prophets to
[58:51] be able to do it now let's look in the
[58:53] in the New Testament Matthew chapter 2
[58:56] verse
[58:57] 23 for the Jews whenever they come to
[59:00] the time the of the Messianic
[59:02] dispensation in the New Testament they
[59:05] had to have it proved to them by the Old
[59:08] Testament prophets that Jesus was the
[59:10] Messiah and watch he came and dwelt in a
[59:13] city called
[59:16] nazarus that it might be fulfilled which
[59:19] was spoken by the
[59:24] priest by the elders
[59:27] by the organizational fathers by
[59:31] who the prophets he shall be called a
[59:36] Nazarene now watch Matthew writes his
[59:39] gospel after the Lord Jesus has come and
[59:42] lived on the earth and done gone so now
[59:45] they're going backwards and they're
[59:47] riding in retrospect and they're writing
[59:50] after they got the Holy Ghost so
[59:52] remember all these events and the four
[59:54] gospels is not being written while it's
[59:56] happening I'm glad too cuz the Lord knew
[59:58] how to do that it would have sounded
[1:00:01] totally different had the gospels been
[1:00:03] written pre Holy Ghost that's why the
[1:00:06] gospels are preached different when men
[1:00:08] don't have the Holy Ghost a man with the
[1:00:11] Holy Ghost that preaches Matthew is
[1:00:14] totally different from a man who don't
[1:00:15] have the Holy Ghost that preaches
[1:00:17] Matthew so if Matthew was written before
[1:00:20] Matthew got the Holy Ghost Matthew would
[1:00:22] sound different after Matthew got the
[1:00:24] Holy Ghost so it's the same with us in
[1:00:27] the way that we read it notice again in
[1:00:29] Matthew 5:17 think not this is Jesus now
[1:00:33] think not that I am come to destroy the
[1:00:36] law or the prophets now this is the way
[1:00:40] dispensation that the Old Testament was
[1:00:43] divided so it was not divided in the way
[1:00:46] you never find Jesus you never find Paul
[1:00:49] any of the New Testament preachers ever
[1:00:51] going down through and say the book of
[1:00:53] Zechariah the book of this the book of
[1:00:55] that the book of
[1:00:56] but they would group it into two
[1:00:59] categories the law and the prophets the
[1:01:04] law and the prophets you look study your
[1:01:06] own Bible you'll find this used over and
[1:01:09] over again so the law which came by
[1:01:11] Moses and then the prophets but remember
[1:01:13] the Sadducees the Sadducees only took
[1:01:18] the first five books of
[1:01:20] Moses so they never took Joshua Judges
[1:01:24] they never took Jeremiah Hosea Ezekiel
[1:01:27] can you imagine how much they
[1:01:31] missed they missed all of Isaiah so they
[1:01:35] only took the first five books of Moses
[1:01:38] so to them all that they felt like was
[1:01:41] Vindicated was the first five books of
[1:01:43] Moses no wonder they were so ignorant
[1:01:46] when John the Baptist came and when
[1:01:48] Jesus came now just relate that now to
[1:01:52] people in the day that we are living in
[1:01:55] that will not take another god-sent
[1:01:57] prophet in this age so how much they
[1:02:02] miss so you imagine living in that day
[1:02:04] you were a sadducee and somebody quoted
[1:02:06] from the book of Jeremiah and you say h
[1:02:08] i don't I don't read that Jeremiah
[1:02:11] stuff Hosea
[1:02:14] Hosea Moses never wrote Hosea you're
[1:02:17] adding to the
[1:02:18] word the original word was the first
[1:02:21] five books of Moses we don't need
[1:02:23] nothing else
[1:02:26] it's no wonder then the Pharisees did
[1:02:29] not believe in angels demons
[1:02:33] Resurrection Life After
[1:02:35] Death why Moses never wrote about
[1:02:39] it so you can see why modern
[1:02:43] Christianity misunderstands and misses
[1:02:46] so much and we don't say this with our
[1:02:48] chest stuck out B we know more than
[1:02:51] everybody but also more is required of
[1:02:53] us because of what we know to me it's
[1:02:57] worth the requirement ain't it you now
[1:03:00] watch think not that I'm come to destroy
[1:03:02] the law the Pent the Torah or the
[1:03:06] prophets Jeremiah Ezekiel naam Hosea
[1:03:10] Amos on and on I am not come to destroy
[1:03:14] but to fulfill but now remember there's
[1:03:17] still many Prophecies of of Jeremiah of
[1:03:22] Ezekiel of Zachariah of hag
[1:03:26] even of those Old Testament prophets
[1:03:28] that have not yet been fulfilled so
[1:03:32] people who think the Old Testament is
[1:03:35] totally done and finished no D to even
[1:03:38] read as a matter of fact there was some
[1:03:39] visitors that had come here not long ago
[1:03:41] and they made comment to somebody from
[1:03:43] our church and said your pastor read
[1:03:46] from the Old Testament today does he
[1:03:49] preach often from the Old
[1:03:53] Testament well that's the way they look
[1:03:55] at it well the old testament's fulfilled
[1:03:57] we don't need it no more so what about
[1:03:59] in Zachariah where the mountain is going
[1:04:02] to be cut in half and part of it toward
[1:04:04] the former sea and part of it toward the
[1:04:06] hinder sea that's at the coming of the
[1:04:08] Lord Jesus when he's going to fight the
[1:04:10] battle of Armageddon what about all them
[1:04:13] prophecies it makes you feel so sorry
[1:04:15] for them notice again Matthew 7:12
[1:04:19] therefore all things whatsoever you
[1:04:21] would that men should do to you even
[1:04:25] even so do to them so to them for this
[1:04:29] is the
[1:04:31] law and the prophets Matthew 11:13 for
[1:04:35] all the prophets and the law prophesied
[1:04:39] until John now remember this is a common
[1:04:42] saying among them Matthew
[1:04:45] 22:40 on these two Commandments hang all
[1:04:50] the law and the prophets so they quoted
[1:04:52] it over and over and over again so the
[1:04:56] Torah and the prophets the Torah and the
[1:04:59] prophets Matthew 23:29 woe unto you
[1:05:02] scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites because
[1:05:05] you build the tombs of the prophets and
[1:05:09] garnish the sepers of the righteous and
[1:05:12] say if we had been in the days of our
[1:05:15] fathers we would not have been partakers
[1:05:17] with them in the blood of the prophets
[1:05:21] wherefore you be Witnesses unto
[1:05:23] yourselves ye are the children
[1:05:26] of them that killed the prophets and you
[1:05:29] what's amazing is this age has done
[1:05:32] exactly the same thing boy if I'd have
[1:05:35] lived it back y in the days of Jeremiah
[1:05:38] I can't believe them people would have
[1:05:39] throwed him down in that mud pit and
[1:05:42] left him down there for days can you
[1:05:44] imagine that Prophet Jeremiah being
[1:05:47] thrown down in an abandoned well in mud
[1:05:50] up on his body can you imagine Isaiah
[1:05:53] been put in a hollow l
[1:05:56] and they take a Crosscut saw and cut
[1:06:00] that man in
[1:06:03] two and yet the people come back and
[1:06:05] said oh what a great man Jeremiah Was
[1:06:08] what a great man Ezekiel was and Jesus
[1:06:12] said it was your fathers that killed him
[1:06:15] and you said boy if I lived in that day
[1:06:17] you said what Jesus is trying to get him
[1:06:19] to see but this is your day and may I
[1:06:22] say to us tonight this is our day so we
[1:06:25] you don't want to look back and say oh
[1:06:26] man I'll tell you one thing if I'd have
[1:06:28] been in the days of brother Bram I would
[1:06:30] have stood for him but this is the
[1:06:32] continuation of those same days so we be
[1:06:36] identified with what we do with it right
[1:06:38] now notice again in Luke chap 13:34 oh
[1:06:42] Jerusalem Jerusalem which killest the
[1:06:46] prophets and stonest them that are sent
[1:06:49] unto thee how often I would have
[1:06:52] gathered thy children together as a hand
[1:06:53] do gather her brood under her wings and
[1:06:56] you would not chapter 18:31 then he took
[1:07:00] unto him the 12 and said unto them
[1:07:02] behold we go to Jerusalem and all things
[1:07:05] that are written by the prophets Jesus
[1:07:10] ministry constantly was quoting the
[1:07:14] prophets I just find it so hard to
[1:07:16] understand why that modern day
[1:07:18] Christians think it's so weird and
[1:07:22] strange that Christianity
[1:07:25] would want to be based upon prophets
[1:07:29] what I think is weird and strange is
[1:07:32] Christians don't think it all to be this
[1:07:35] is the beginning of Christianity this is
[1:07:38] the beginning of the apostolic church
[1:07:40] and what was they constantly referring
[1:07:42] back to look at Paul look at Peter look
[1:07:44] at James and they constantly and the
[1:07:46] prophet said and the prophet said and
[1:07:49] the prophets said that's how they were
[1:07:51] proving that Jesus was the Christ
[1:07:55] notice in verse 25 then he said unto
[1:07:59] them oh
[1:08:00] fools and slow of heart to believe all
[1:08:05] that the prophets had spoken verse 27
[1:08:09] and beginning at Moses and all the
[1:08:12] prophets he expounded unto them in all
[1:08:16] the scriptures the things
[1:08:21] concerning
[1:08:24] himself so what's he doing he preaches a
[1:08:27] 6-hour sermon on
[1:08:30] Prophecy so maybe started with able
[1:08:34] started back in the Garden of Eden maybe
[1:08:37] Deuteronomy
[1:08:39] 18:15 behold the Lord shall God shall
[1:08:42] raise up a prophet liken unto me from
[1:08:44] among your brethren and whosoever shall
[1:08:47] not hear this Prophet will be cut off
[1:08:49] maybe Deuteronomy 23 maybe Zachariah 12
[1:08:54] maybe Isaiah 35 the lame man shall leap
[1:08:58] as an heart the tongue of the dumb shall
[1:09:00] sing maybe Hagi 27 the the desire of all
[1:09:06] the nations shall come on and on and on
[1:09:10] and all them scriptures is pointing to
[1:09:12] him except he wasn't saying and that's
[1:09:15] me and that's me and that's me but he
[1:09:18] wanted to quote the scriptures and see
[1:09:21] if they would be able to by their own
[1:09:24] understanding say
[1:09:27] that's
[1:09:29] him oh my goodness I've read that since
[1:09:32] a boy I've read that since a child since
[1:09:36] Torah
[1:09:37] school that scripture is made
[1:09:43] flesh praise the
[1:09:45] Lord notice in John chapter 1 verse 45
[1:09:51] Phillip findeth
[1:09:53] Nathaniel and saith unto to him we have
[1:09:57] found him who Moses in the law and the
[1:10:03] prophets did right Jesus of Nazareth the
[1:10:08] son of
[1:10:09] Joseph again John
[1:10:11] 645 it is written in the prophets they
[1:10:15] shall all be taught of God every man
[1:10:18] therefore that has heard and that have
[1:10:20] learned of the father cometh unto me
[1:10:23] acts 3:24 yay and and all the prophets
[1:10:26] from Samuel and those that follow after
[1:10:30] as many as have spoken have likewise
[1:10:34] foretold of these days so what are they
[1:10:36] doing they're taking these new Believers
[1:10:40] and they're pointing them right back to
[1:10:42] the prophets not starting Christianity
[1:10:45] and saying we don't even need that Old
[1:10:48] Testament no more you see how ignorant a
[1:10:51] lot of modernday Christians even a lot
[1:10:54] of modern day preachers are spent many
[1:10:58] years in seminary and don't even see
[1:11:01] these things from the Bible when
[1:11:03] modernday Christianity is supposed to be
[1:11:06] a reflection of apostolic Christianity
[1:11:09] but surely you can see tonight it's not
[1:11:12] because the very thing the way that God
[1:11:14] established is we don't believe in no
[1:11:16] Prophet why they got away with them in
[1:11:18] the Old Testament that's strange I'm
[1:11:20] reading to you tonight one old test New
[1:11:22] Testament scripture after another and
[1:11:24] it's evident it was based upon Old
[1:11:26] Testament
[1:11:28] prophecy
[1:11:29] amen acts
[1:11:31] 10:43 to him give all the prophets
[1:11:36] witness that through his name whosoever
[1:11:39] believeth in him shall receive remission
[1:11:41] of sin acts 13:27 for they that dwell in
[1:11:44] Jerusalem and their rulers because they
[1:11:47] knew him
[1:11:49] not uhoh nor yet the
[1:11:53] voices of the prophet prophets which are
[1:11:57] read every Sabbath
[1:12:01] day are you talking about making these
[1:12:04] people
[1:12:05] mad so here whenever he preaches this he
[1:12:09] says they did not recognize him nor do
[1:12:13] they recognize the voices of their
[1:12:16] prophets because their prophets was
[1:12:18] talking about the Lord Jesus are you
[1:12:20] talking about making them fighting mad
[1:12:22] they studied these prophets they say
[1:12:25] that those priests and men who never
[1:12:27] knew those Scrolls could take those
[1:12:29] Scrolls up and they could roll them up
[1:12:31] just like this and if possible they
[1:12:34] could have took a pen and stuck a pen
[1:12:37] through that scroll and tell you every
[1:12:40] word that it would have passed through
[1:12:43] they knew it that
[1:12:46] well that's somebody that knows what
[1:12:48] they're talking about somebody told me
[1:12:50] today of the man who owns the Evergreen
[1:12:53] Nursery over in Kingsport they are first
[1:12:55] generation immigrants their parents were
[1:12:57] immigrants that moved here to to America
[1:13:00] and their father started the business
[1:13:04] that the sons now run Johnson City and
[1:13:06] in Kingsport and the some people told
[1:13:08] him and said why don't you get a bobcat
[1:13:10] and you know and attractor with a bucket
[1:13:12] he said why get all that I've got four
[1:13:14] boys with shovels and they say the owner
[1:13:17] of the one in Kingsport to this day can
[1:13:20] load a ton of
[1:13:23] Rock with a fade or a shovel and get
[1:13:27] within 20 lbs of a ton now you don't do
[1:13:32] that by reading a book you don't do that
[1:13:35] by sitting in air conditioning with your
[1:13:37] feet all kick back drinking a glass of
[1:13:40] ice cold Southern sweet tea but you do
[1:13:43] it by shoveling and feeling the pressure
[1:13:46] and feeling the weight so here this is
[1:13:48] the way that we as Christians we don't
[1:13:51] want to just come to the house of God
[1:13:53] and let the preacher do all the study oh
[1:13:55] brother Donnie you study so good and
[1:13:58] brother Daryl my we thank you thank you
[1:14:01] thank you well that's all well and good
[1:14:02] for me to do that but you want to be
[1:14:04] able to do in Your Capacity to where do
[1:14:08] I expect you or brother Rob or any the
[1:14:10] rest of the brother CH expect you to be
[1:14:11] able to explain all this the way maybe a
[1:14:13] preacher would no but from your
[1:14:15] capability you want to be able to stand
[1:14:17] and if your questionings that well I may
[1:14:20] not be able to explain the way our
[1:14:21] pastor can but I'll tell you what I sat
[1:14:23] in a young service I used service not
[1:14:25] long ago he went from the Old Testament
[1:14:28] right down to the new proven why we
[1:14:30] still believe in prophets because it's
[1:14:33] all through the Bible we don't have to
[1:14:35] be ashamed of what we
[1:14:37] believe because in reality we believe
[1:14:40] more Bible than all these denominations
[1:14:42] put together out here I know I know I
[1:14:45] know they say we're not a Bible
[1:14:47] believing church I wish there here
[1:14:49] tonight I wish they'd come and hear how
[1:14:51] much Bible we do believe can you all say
[1:14:53] Amen to that
[1:14:55] now what what's Paul in Romans 3:21 said
[1:14:58] but now the righteousness of God without
[1:15:00] the law is manifested being witnessed by
[1:15:05] the law and the prophets now notice
[1:15:08] again they bring this same connotation
[1:15:10] over from the early days of the of the
[1:15:13] gospels to hear Paul is saying the same
[1:15:15] thing Romans 16:26 the law and the
[1:15:18] prophets but now is made manifest and by
[1:15:21] the
[1:15:23] scriptures of the
[1:15:26] prophets you mean to tell
[1:15:28] me they looked at these men with their
[1:15:32] open
[1:15:33] vision and believed that what they
[1:15:37] said was
[1:15:40] scriptures
[1:15:42] wow now remember they were men they had
[1:15:45] their ups and their downs was everything
[1:15:47] that went out of the mouth of Jeremiah
[1:15:50] the word of the Lord of course not
[1:15:52] Jeremiah got into great strain and a
[1:15:55] great trial and he was hated man I'll
[1:15:57] tell you he's always been one of my
[1:15:58] heroes I can't wait to meet Jeremiah
[1:16:00] I've always had such an admiration for
[1:16:02] him he was so hated and so despised and
[1:16:06] Jeremiah got so down one day he said
[1:16:10] I'll tell you what I made up my mind I
[1:16:13] ain't speaking no
[1:16:15] more in the name of the Lord I can't
[1:16:19] take it I ain't speaking no more in the
[1:16:23] name of the Lord
[1:16:26] but then he said I found out I couldn't
[1:16:28] restrain myself cuz it was like fire
[1:16:31] shut up in my bones so Jeremiah was a
[1:16:35] man Moses was a man Ezekiel was a man
[1:16:40] but they were still God's
[1:16:42] mouthpieces praise the Lord notice in 1
[1:16:46] Corinthians
[1:16:47] 14:29 now for those who don't believe
[1:16:51] that the New Testament spoke about
[1:16:52] prophets now remember this is not the
[1:16:54] same caliber a prophet is the Old
[1:16:56] Testament there were prophets in the New
[1:16:59] Testament agabus was a new testament
[1:17:02] prophet he prophesied of a dur which was
[1:17:06] a famine that was going to come he also
[1:17:09] prophesied to Paul and he took one of
[1:17:11] Paul's garments and he never had met
[1:17:13] Paul and he took Paul's garment and went
[1:17:16] over to Paul and and kind of tied around
[1:17:19] him and he said whoever garment this is
[1:17:21] this man he's going to Jerusalem he's
[1:17:24] going to be bound now remember he didn't
[1:17:26] know him so it was exactly the word of
[1:17:29] the Lord but here Paul is identifying
[1:17:33] people in the church that are
[1:17:36] prophesying under the inspiration of
[1:17:38] tongues or interpretation now watch he
[1:17:41] said let the prophets speak two or three
[1:17:45] and let the other judge now there are
[1:17:49] some of the message of course that feel
[1:17:50] like that gifts should not be judged and
[1:17:53] they feel like that brother brandham
[1:17:54] kind of brought that from the Baptist
[1:17:56] idea ah you see you need to read First
[1:17:59] Corinthians a little bit closer because
[1:18:02] Paul was actually the one who said gifts
[1:18:04] needs to be judged it did not start with
[1:18:07] brother brandham it started with Paul
[1:18:10] and the spirits of the prophets are
[1:18:13] subject to the prophets so here in the
[1:18:16] New Testament Church they believed in
[1:18:19] them type of prophets as well now let's
[1:18:22] go back to Malachi 4 Malachi 4 4 verse 5
[1:18:26] the coming of Elias which is the Greek
[1:18:29] rendition of Elijah of the Old Testament
[1:18:32] but notice what Malachi says behold I
[1:18:35] will send you Elijah the prophet before
[1:18:39] the coming of the great and Dreadful day
[1:18:41] of the Lord he shall turn the heart of
[1:18:45] the fathers to the
[1:18:48] children and conjunction joins two
[1:18:52] thoughts together the heart of the
[1:18:55] children to their fathers lest I come
[1:18:58] and smite the Earth with a curse now
[1:19:01] let's look in Luke chapter 1 verse
[1:19:04] 15 this is speaking of John the Baptist
[1:19:09] for he shall be great in the sight of
[1:19:11] the Lord and He Shall drink neither wine
[1:19:14] nor strong drink and he shall be filled
[1:19:17] with the Holy Ghost even from his
[1:19:20] mother's womb and many of the children
[1:19:23] of Israel
[1:19:25] shall he
[1:19:26] turn to the Lord their
[1:19:30] God now notice the office of a prophet
[1:19:34] in the New Testament he's going to turn
[1:19:38] the
[1:19:39] hearts of these children to the Lord God
[1:19:43] but also verse 17 he shall go before him
[1:19:47] in the spirit and power of Elias so it
[1:19:52] was not The Reincarnation of Elijah but
[1:19:55] it was the anointing of Elijah on a man
[1:19:59] born between another man and
[1:20:02] woman to turn the hearts of the
[1:20:06] fathers to the children and now wait a
[1:20:09] minute Malachi quoted two parts of this
[1:20:14] Malachi said he will turn the hearts of
[1:20:17] the fathers to the children
[1:20:19] and the Heart of the children to their
[1:20:23] fathers
[1:20:25] but when this Angel is coming bringing
[1:20:27] the message about John the Baptist he
[1:20:29] only quotes half of Malachi
[1:20:34] 4 and it is the half that pertains to
[1:20:38] that day so he will turn the hearts of
[1:20:42] the fathers to the children what fathers
[1:20:45] are we talking about those old Jewish
[1:20:47] fathers which was totally contrary to
[1:20:50] understand their Customs the elders I
[1:20:53] you know it's hard to imagine imagine
[1:20:55] but Abraham even though he would have
[1:20:57] been up in his years 50 60 70 years old
[1:21:01] but yet his father still being alive he
[1:21:04] was still been considered under the
[1:21:06] headship of his father whenever God made
[1:21:10] known to Abraham the revelation of I am
[1:21:13] and who he was it was against all oral
[1:21:17] tradition for him to Buck against his
[1:21:20] father and say father I'm leaving you it
[1:21:23] it would have T that family to shreds
[1:21:27] because the patriarchal headship of the
[1:21:30] way they looked at it oh my it would
[1:21:33] have just broke everything they had
[1:21:36] believed for hundreds and hundreds of
[1:21:38] years and yet God made Abraham do it so
[1:21:44] for Malachi to prophesy this that there
[1:21:48] will come a day that the father's Hearts
[1:21:52] will be turned to the children
[1:21:55] are you kidding me there's no way that's
[1:21:58] not the way the patriarchal ancestry of
[1:22:01] the genealogy and the way the structure
[1:22:04] of the home was set up you imagine
[1:22:05] Abraham a man 70 75 years old and he
[1:22:08] goes to his father and said that this
[1:22:11] this God has has appeared to me and I I
[1:22:14] I I need your permission to leave well
[1:22:17] some of y'all don't do that at
[1:22:20] 15 Amen brother Donnie Amen brother
[1:22:23] Donnie
[1:22:25] but look at the structure of how they
[1:22:27] believed it and yet a prophecy was that
[1:22:31] one day there come a man on the earth
[1:22:33] under such an anointing that that
[1:22:36] anointing he's operating on will
[1:22:38] actually CA some of the fathers and they
[1:22:41] will actually turn to the message that
[1:22:44] the children are are carrying I see for
[1:22:47] us it don't make any sense because we're
[1:22:50] reading the Bible from our Western
[1:22:53] understanding from if you would have
[1:22:55] been an easterner and you would have
[1:22:57] heard this prophecy You' said what no
[1:23:00] way no way God will ever make us fathers
[1:23:04] bow down to the
[1:23:06] children and what did God do God took a
[1:23:09] 33 year old man called John the Baptist
[1:23:13] and took another 33y old man which would
[1:23:15] have been an upstart and green and
[1:23:18] whatever words they would have used in
[1:23:19] that day to look down on a young guy and
[1:23:22] they said are you kidding me me and
[1:23:25] Jesus rebuked the elders you got to be
[1:23:29] kidding Jesus would rebuke the elders
[1:23:33] these are the men that everybody reveres
[1:23:35] you just didn't do that you get your
[1:23:37] head cut off for doing
[1:23:40] it
[1:23:41] wow so watch what John the Baptist now
[1:23:44] is going to do so he will be great and
[1:23:48] the side of the Lord he'll drink NE the
[1:23:50] wine going to be a Nazarite of course
[1:23:52] and many of the children of Israel shall
[1:23:54] he turn to the Lord their God and he
[1:23:56] shall go before him in the spirit and
[1:23:57] power of theas to turn the hearts of the
[1:24:00] fathers to the
[1:24:02] children and the disobedient to the
[1:24:05] wisdom of the just now wait a minute
[1:24:06] where's that other part that Malachi
[1:24:09] said the hearts of the children back to
[1:24:12] the fathers John the Baptist was not
[1:24:14] called for that is't it amazing how God
[1:24:17] can divide the scripture right in the
[1:24:19] middle of a
[1:24:21] line and fulfill one part of it and wait
[1:24:25] for 2,000 years to fulfill the other
[1:24:28] part praise God thank you Lord
[1:24:33] Jesus can I have a few more minutes
[1:24:35] before we close and we'll pick it up
[1:24:36] again so the disciples asked the Lord
[1:24:39] Jesus about the coming of Elijah and as
[1:24:42] they come down from the mountain now
[1:24:44] Jesus is this is Mount Transfiguration
[1:24:46] Jesus has been transformed transfigured
[1:24:49] so as they come down from the mountain
[1:24:51] Jesus charged him saying tell the vision
[1:24:54] to no man until the son of man be risen
[1:24:57] again from the dead and his disciples
[1:24:59] asked him saying why then say the
[1:25:03] scribes that
[1:25:05] Elias must first come now listen very
[1:25:09] carefully Jesus answered and said unto
[1:25:14] them
[1:25:15] Elias
[1:25:17] truly
[1:25:19] shall future tense right shall first
[1:25:25] come and this is what he'll do and
[1:25:29] restore all things so Elias truly shall
[1:25:36] future tense come and restore all things
[1:25:39] look at me at the meaning of the word
[1:25:41] restore restore again to restore to its
[1:25:45] former
[1:25:47] state to be in its former state so if
[1:25:50] John the Baptist fulfilled that part why
[1:25:54] did Jesus said
[1:25:58] shall and if John the Baptist was
[1:26:00] supposed to restore what did he restore
[1:26:06] to Moses never
[1:26:10] baptized right that was not John the
[1:26:13] Baptist
[1:26:16] calling that was your prophet's
[1:26:19] calling then watch Jesus he goes from
[1:26:22] the future prophecy Elias coming but I
[1:26:25] say unto
[1:26:27] you that Elias has come
[1:26:31] already you imagine them
[1:26:35] as they ask him why do you speaking
[1:26:38] riddles why do you speaking Parables I
[1:26:41] mean you say one thing and then you say
[1:26:43] something else so Jesus says look Elias
[1:26:45] is going to come one day but he's
[1:26:47] already
[1:26:49] come and you're thinking yeah right
[1:26:52] right I mean what am I doing here wh wh
[1:26:55] why am I following this man what in the
[1:26:57] world he's coming but he's
[1:26:59] come you see even it it even does the
[1:27:01] same thing today when people look at us
[1:27:03] and we say glory to God the Lord Jesus
[1:27:06] has come but he's coming and people say
[1:27:08] they're nuts they're absolutely out of
[1:27:11] their mind no we believe he has come in
[1:27:14] a spiritual coming he is here but we're
[1:27:18] waiting for the Corporal body to come
[1:27:21] back so here Jesus is speaking in a dual
[1:27:24] language well Elijah's coming he could
[1:27:26] have called his name he could have told
[1:27:28] us what day he's going to be born amen
[1:27:30] April 6 1909 burville Kentucky a lot
[1:27:33] will come in he could have told all that
[1:27:35] but he didn't want to he wanted to leave
[1:27:38] that so the
[1:27:39] elect will'll be able to find out who it
[1:27:43] was now watch so Jesus doesn't even say
[1:27:48] hey boys let me just give you an inside
[1:27:50] tip it's John the Baptist
[1:27:55] so Jesus didn't say that he says
[1:27:59] Elias has come already and they know him
[1:28:01] not but they've done whatsoever they
[1:28:03] listed likewise shall also the son of
[1:28:05] man suffer them then the
[1:28:09] disciples
[1:28:12] understood that he spake unto
[1:28:15] them of John the
[1:28:18] Baptist oh so maybe that was the reason
[1:28:23] Jesus didn't say said hey boys it's
[1:28:27] John he wanted to paint the scripture
[1:28:31] image and hope they would wake up you
[1:28:35] know
[1:28:37] Ding and they finally hit him
[1:28:40] ding you understand some of these men
[1:28:44] were formerly
[1:28:46] John's
[1:28:49] disciples imagine brother way whenever
[1:28:52] they finally recognized it
[1:28:54] and they didn't even know who he
[1:28:56] was till after John's them been killed
[1:28:59] and Jesus said it was it was Elijah and
[1:29:01] they're thinking oh my Lord I walked
[1:29:05] with him I was with the man I sat under
[1:29:08] his ministry you mean that was the
[1:29:12] anointing of
[1:29:14] Elijah may God help us that it don't
[1:29:16] pass before us and we wake up and
[1:29:21] realize my John 1: 19 this is then the
[1:29:27] record of John when the Jews sent
[1:29:29] priests and Levites from Jerusalem to
[1:29:32] ask him who art
[1:29:34] thou and he confessed and denied not but
[1:29:38] confessed I am not the
[1:29:41] Christos the
[1:29:44] Christ and they asked him what then art
[1:29:48] thou
[1:29:49] Elias and he sayth I am not
[1:29:56] well now wait a
[1:29:57] minute
[1:29:59] Jesus said he
[1:30:02] was but they ask John direct re and John
[1:30:05] says
[1:30:07] no I am not
[1:30:13] Elijah what you say brother Donnie which
[1:30:16] one of them told the truth both of
[1:30:20] them you see if you catch the
[1:30:22] phraseology of the way they asked him
[1:30:26] they were ask him about the Elijah of
[1:30:29] the last day and John said uh oh boys
[1:30:32] you got it at the wrong dispensation I'm
[1:30:35] not that Elijah John did not lie he told
[1:30:38] them truth but John understood the
[1:30:41] gospel in a dispensational way does that
[1:30:45] make sense to you
[1:30:46] tonight and he says I am not art thou
[1:30:50] that prophet and he answered nope
[1:30:55] and they said unto him who art
[1:30:58] thou that we may give an answer to them
[1:31:01] that sent us what sayest thou of thyself
[1:31:04] oh their feathers are getting rougher by
[1:31:06] now ain't they and he said I'm the voice
[1:31:09] of one crying in the
[1:31:13] wilderness make straight the way of the
[1:31:16] Lord as said the prophet as sayas Isaiah
[1:31:21] 40:3 the voice of him that crying on the
[1:31:23] the Wilderness prepare you the way of
[1:31:25] the Lord make straight in the
[1:31:27] desert a highway for our God and I found
[1:31:31] this bit of history and I want to share
[1:31:33] it with you the idea is taken from the
[1:31:36] practice of Eastern monarchs who
[1:31:39] whenever they entered upon an expedition
[1:31:41] or took a journey especially through the
[1:31:44] desert and unpracticed countries sent
[1:31:47] harbingers before them to prepare all
[1:31:50] things for their passage and Pion iers
[1:31:54] now listen to this word
[1:31:57] Pioneers to open the
[1:32:01] passes so they were harbingers so
[1:32:04] they're going to open up now remember
[1:32:06] they didn't have Interstate 26 they
[1:32:08] didn't even have a Milligan Highway or
[1:32:10] Governor alph Taylor wrote so they had
[1:32:13] rocks they had all kinds of things in
[1:32:15] the way so they would send away and John
[1:32:18] identifies himself by Revelation and say
[1:32:21] this is who I am I'm here to pick up the
[1:32:24] rocks out of the way I'm here to get the
[1:32:27] sticks out of the way he's right behind
[1:32:31] me he's right behind
[1:32:35] me oh
[1:32:37] my to open up the passes to level the
[1:32:41] ways to remove all impediments so John
[1:32:45] the Baptist calls himself the
[1:32:47] pioneer of the Messiah whose business it
[1:32:51] was as a loud voice to call upon the
[1:32:54] people dwelling in the deserts to level
[1:32:57] and prepare the roads by which the King
[1:33:02] was about to
[1:33:04] March Isaiah 40 and4 every Valley shall
[1:33:08] be exalted Every Mountain and Hill shall
[1:33:11] be made low and the Crooked shall be
[1:33:13] made straight and the rough places plain
[1:33:17] and the glory of the Lord shall be
[1:33:19] revealed and All Flesh shall see it
[1:33:22] together for the mouths of the Lord Lord
[1:33:24] has spoken it now back to John 1:24 and
[1:33:27] they which were sin of the Pharisees
[1:33:29] they asked him and said unto him why
[1:33:31] baptizes thou then if thou be not that
[1:33:35] Christ nor
[1:33:37] Elias neither that Prophet John answered
[1:33:41] them saying I baptize thee with
[1:33:45] water but there standest one among you
[1:33:49] whom you know not he it is whom coming
[1:33:52] after me is preer heard before me whose
[1:33:55] shoes latchet I'm not worthy to unloose
[1:34:00] verse 28 we'll close you bear witness
[1:34:03] you yourselves bear me witness that I
[1:34:05] said I am not the Christ but that I am
[1:34:08] sent before him he that hath the
[1:34:13] bride I don't know if you know this or
[1:34:15] not but the first man in the New
[1:34:19] Testament to refer to the church as a
[1:34:23] bride
[1:34:24] was a man under the spirit of
[1:34:28] Elijah John the
[1:34:31] Baptist he that hath the bride is the
[1:34:34] bridegroom Now watch how John identifies
[1:34:36] himself but the friend of the bridegroom
[1:34:40] which standeth and hearth him rejoiceth
[1:34:44] greatly because of the bridegroom's
[1:34:48] voice this my joy therefore is
[1:34:54] fulfill now John is identifying himself
[1:34:57] with a common practice of that day and
[1:34:59] that was that if a man was interested in
[1:35:02] a girl a woman he would go to his father
[1:35:06] or he would go to a lawyer sometimes or
[1:35:08] a friend his uncle and he would tell his
[1:35:11] uncle his father whoever it was I'm
[1:35:13] interested in that sister and it he
[1:35:16] would not go and do it but the friend of
[1:35:19] the bridegroom would go and talk to the
[1:35:21] bride's father and the bride mother and
[1:35:24] they would start working on a compact to
[1:35:27] be able to make it together not the
[1:35:29] bride and groom they didn't have none of
[1:35:30] this stuff of the bride and groom thing
[1:35:32] well they're going to go out and they're
[1:35:33] going to you know in that rebellious age
[1:35:35] of the RO I don't need to talk to the
[1:35:37] daddy I don't need to talk to this
[1:35:39] that's the way they did it that's the
[1:35:41] exact way that Mary and Joseph was
[1:35:44] joined together under that exact pattern
[1:35:47] so John identifies himself as the friend
[1:35:50] of the bridegroom now John went and saw
[1:35:53] the bride John took the garments to the
[1:35:56] bride John actually would be the one the
[1:35:59] messenger the friend that would drop the
[1:36:02] message to them and let them know cuz
[1:36:04] the bride didn't know exactly when the
[1:36:06] day was so the groom would just decide
[1:36:09] today's the
[1:36:11] day today's the day and of course the
[1:36:14] bride didn't have text WhatsApp Zoom you
[1:36:17] know now that stuff so you know who the
[1:36:19] groom depended on to let the bride know
[1:36:23] now you doesn't get her wedding gwn and
[1:36:24] all that the friend of the
[1:36:26] bridegroom so the friend of the
[1:36:28] bridegroom I mean he goone that day it
[1:36:30] was the day that she washed her hair it
[1:36:33] was a day that she didn't normally put
[1:36:34] it in curlers it was the day that
[1:36:36] everything was all been out of shape oh
[1:36:38] no no no not today I've got to go to the
[1:36:40] market I've got to go but he told me to
[1:36:42] tell you today is the day glory to
[1:36:48] God so well how how how the world she
[1:36:52] going to be ready she is not going to be
[1:36:55] unless she hears the voice of that
[1:36:58] messenger you see only those who hear
[1:37:01] the voice of the message and the
[1:37:03] Messenger will be ready who was it that
[1:37:07] received the Lord Jesus those that John
[1:37:09] had prepared this one thing the angel of
[1:37:11] the Lord told him he shall turn many of
[1:37:14] the hearts to the Lord and He fulfilled
[1:37:19] that thank God thank God verse 30 let's
[1:37:23] Stand
[1:37:24] Together John speaking about Jesus he
[1:37:29] must
[1:37:30] increase but I must
[1:37:36] decrease that Simon of course Andrew his
[1:37:40] brother had already been following
[1:37:42] John Jesus was there whenever he
[1:37:45] baptized him and a few days later he
[1:37:47] comes up and pass by and John turns and
[1:37:51] says behold
[1:37:54] the Lamb of God which taketh away the
[1:37:57] sins of the world and you can see that
[1:38:00] John is a true Messenger because you
[1:38:02] know what he done he pointed his
[1:38:04] disciples to the Lord
[1:38:07] Jesus so John did not have a problem
[1:38:11] with them looking
[1:38:14] away from John's flesh and following the
[1:38:19] Lord Jesus he was the Lamb of God oh my
[1:38:23] I think every real true preacher feels
[1:38:25] that way they want the people that
[1:38:27] they're preaching to let me decrease Let
[1:38:31] Jesus increase in our church this is
[1:38:34] what the prophet God you know what
[1:38:35] breaks your heart is that for many they
[1:38:38] want the prophet to increase and they
[1:38:40] want all they just you know as the Bible
[1:38:42] said in the book of Acts that they have
[1:38:44] them every Sabbath that preach
[1:38:47] Moses they preach Moses so some all they
[1:38:51] get out of this message is just exalt in
[1:38:53] brother brandom and it's brother
[1:38:54] brandham this and brother brandom that
[1:38:56] one of the things I've never really told
[1:38:57] that much about it a phase when I first
[1:38:59] started coming to the ministry into the
[1:39:01] message one of the things that kept me
[1:39:03] back was an individual that I had met
[1:39:06] some years before I accepted the message
[1:39:09] and it was all the time telling me this
[1:39:11] that and that and that and he was
[1:39:13] constantly pointing to the Flesh of
[1:39:15] brother Brandon and whenever I begin to
[1:39:18] see the message those things it it
[1:39:22] actually it hindered me brother Rob I
[1:39:24] had to fight over the top of it because
[1:39:27] I thought there's no way that man would
[1:39:29] want us to to worship Him want us to
[1:39:33] lift him up cons we're talking about him
[1:39:35] and preaching about him no what did the
[1:39:39] prophet want us to do let him decrease
[1:39:42] Let Jesus increase in our midst is that
[1:39:45] what we want may we decrease that the
[1:39:49] Lord Jesus can
[1:39:51] increase you love him tonight
[1:39:53] with all your hearts let's bow our
[1:39:56] heads heavenly father thank you for your
[1:40:01] word thank you Lord Jesus for the
[1:40:04] scriptures I pray dear God that it will
[1:40:07] open their
[1:40:08] understanding they may not be able to
[1:40:11] take these same scriptures many of them
[1:40:12] have wrote them down tonight and it does
[1:40:14] my heart good to see that father they
[1:40:16] may not have the ability to be able to
[1:40:18] sit down and put it together to share
[1:40:20] with somebody they're going to school
[1:40:22] with or something like that that but
[1:40:24] father may it be more settled in their
[1:40:26] hearts after these studies than it's
[1:40:29] ever been before we love you Lord we
[1:40:33] don't desire to see some man lifted up
[1:40:35] before us it's you Lord Jesus we want to
[1:40:39] worship you and praise you and adore you
[1:40:44] we thank you for letting us see this
[1:40:46] word may these young people not only
[1:40:50] them but everyone else streaming this
[1:40:52] service and those that archive it I know
[1:40:54] there's people in Africa in Europe in
[1:40:57] Alaska Lord all over the world going
[1:40:59] back and and hearing these services and
[1:41:02] being such a blessing to them may each
[1:41:05] of us
[1:41:06] realize we must hear the voice that you
[1:41:10] have sent in this last day or we will
[1:41:13] not be prepared for the coming of the
[1:41:18] Lord only those that heard that voice of
[1:41:22] John and prep preparing their hearts
[1:41:25] were opened up to be able to receive you
[1:41:28] all they might have said oh I don't need
[1:41:30] John I don't get out of my way John
[1:41:32] you're a man I'm after Jesus they
[1:41:34] couldn't have understood you had they
[1:41:36] not come to him and you said it well
[1:41:39] there was a man sent from God whose name
[1:41:42] was John he was not that light but he
[1:41:46] was sent to Bear witness of that light
[1:41:49] that all men through him might be
[1:41:53] believe and be
[1:41:55] saved that's how important a prophet
[1:41:58] messenger is how we thank you for ours
[1:42:02] Lord we're so grateful for sending us a
[1:42:06] prophet to fulfill the latter half of
[1:42:10] Malachi 4 that it would do what turn our
[1:42:14] hearts back to the apostolic
[1:42:17] fathers Lord Jesus I believe I'm looking
[1:42:19] at some young people tonight whose faith
[1:42:22] is turned back to that original word it
[1:42:26] is my honor to be called their Pastor it
[1:42:30] is my honor to preach to them praise be
[1:42:34] to God young people who are baptized the
[1:42:37] same way as some of the young people in
[1:42:40] the book of Acts they believe election
[1:42:43] the same way they believe the gospel the
[1:42:45] teachings of the church in the same way
[1:42:49] that our predecessors did over 2,000
[1:42:51] years ago oh Want to Thank You Lord
[1:42:54] Jesus I'm so glad my heart has been
[1:42:58] turned I give you thanks for it
[1:43:01] tonight thank you father in Jesus name
[1:43:05] brother Rob
[1:43:10] [Applause]
[1:43:25] we're going to sing a few songs but
[1:43:26] first I want to tell you what that did
[1:43:28] for me
[1:43:30] tonight brother Donnie I I've had lots
[1:43:32] of friends but brother Donnie being my
[1:43:34] pastor has been special to me in my life
[1:43:36] because it's something to hear of his
[1:43:39] Revelation I I recognize I have to have
[1:43:42] my
[1:43:43] own and it's something that he paints
[1:43:46] what does he do what has he done for me
[1:43:48] is paint the picture he's an artist
[1:43:51] right he Paints the picture so that you
[1:43:52] can see it okay and then it's easier to
[1:43:56] see it and you can you can he Paints the
[1:43:58] picture so clear that how I it's like
[1:44:00] how can you not see it okay but that has
[1:44:04] to drive you and I'm going to say it
[1:44:05] drives me to look deeper into the word
[1:44:07] so what it is that he shared for me
[1:44:09] tonight is the pattern of the scripture
[1:44:13] so lo I come in the volume of the book
[1:44:15] it is written of Me Jesus said right to
[1:44:17] see the pattern of the scripture from
[1:44:19] Genesis to Revelations to the Old
[1:44:20] Testament throughout the New Testament
[1:44:22] and painting that picture to see it so
[1:44:25] that I can go deeper I cannot rest on
[1:44:28] his Revelation I have to have my own I
[1:44:30] do not deserve a secondhand Revelation
[1:44:33] you must dig into yourself and anchor
[1:44:36] yourself so when someone asks you what
[1:44:37] you believe you have your own Revelation
[1:44:40] to speak from as he mentioned tonight in
[1:44:42] Your
[1:44:43] Capacity right so it's something that's
[1:44:46] what's dear to me so I wanted to share
[1:44:48] with you what I got out of tonight and
[1:44:50] that's where I want to go deeper into
[1:44:51] the scripture I was wondering where he
[1:44:53] was going and sometimes it takes me a
