It feels like everything that can go wrong in the week happens on Wednesday. If it can go wrong at work, it's not going to go wrong on Tuesday or Thursday. It's going to go wrong on Wednesday. But we're here. We might as well take advantage of it. Amen. Let's worship a little bit. I sought the Lord and he [music] answered [singing] me and delivered me [singing] from every fear.

Brother Dave, you'll come and be getting ready to sing. Amen. You ask me how it is that I'm [singing] still standing. You wonder how [singing] I made it through the storm. I can't boast [music] of any special [singing] powers. There's no secret. [music] I just held on [singing] and I held on [music] till the storm was over. I don't claim to be a hero [music] and I [singing] don't have all the answers, [music] but I held on till the storm [singing] was over. Not because I'm good. Not [music] because I'm great. Not because I'm strong. But I held [music] on. I can tell [music] that things are finally happening. [music] And I've [singing] got blessings I can call my [music] own. Many [music and singing] times I wondered if I would make it. [music] But while I was wondering, I just held on. [singing] Oh, and I held on [music] till the [singing] storm was over. [music] And I don't claim to be [singing] a hero. And I don't have all [music] the answers. But I held on till the storm was over.

And I don't claim [music and singing] to be a hero. And I don't have [singing] all the answers. But I held on [music] till the storm was over. [singing] Not because [music] I'm good. Not because I'm great. [singing] Not because [music] I'm strong, but I held on. [music] Amen. Let's give Brother Dave a hand as you're seated. [applause] Like a babe when it [music] cries for its mother. Like a child, [screaming] I was [singing] helpless, alone. Then I met the master. [singing] [music] Now I'm I belong to him. For all things [singing] were changed [music] when he found me. A new [singing] day broke through all around me. [singing] [music] When I met the master, [singing] now I belong [singing] [music] to him. Like a blind man who walks [singing and music] in the darkness. Oh, I had long. [singing] I had searched for the light. Then I met the master. Now I walk no more in the night. For all things were changed when he found [singing] me. [music] A new [singing] day broke [music] through all around me. When I met the master, [singing] now I belong to him. [singing] For all things were changed when he found me. [singing] Oh, a new day broke through all around me. Oh, when I I met the master. Oh, I belong to him. [singing] [music] Amen. Amen. Who else can say they're glad they belong to him? Amen. Let's all stand. We'll get ask brother Donnie to come and bring us the word of the Lord and we'll sing his song as he comes out. We are standing on holy [singing] ground. [music] And I [singing] know that there are angels [music] all [singing] around. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Let us praise Jesus. [singing] Now we [music] [singing] are standing in his [music] presence on holy [singing] ground. [music] Oh, we [singing and music] are standing on holy [music] [singing] ground. [music] And I know Heat. Heat. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; We just raise our hands, close our eyes. Oh, [music] we are standing. Thank you, Father, [music] for this privilege. We can stand at this sacred nest [music] tonight, Lord, in this sacred place to sing, [music] to worship, to magnify you, Lord Jesus. We believe your angels are in this place tonight. Lord God, [music] let us pray. Let us love [music] and praise him now. [music] Thank you, Lord Jesus. [music] We're standing in his presence on holy ground. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that awesome presence that we experienced this past weekend, especially Sunday. I was thinking about it today that I hoped our church realized what was causing that. The angels of God were among us. Yeah, we're here to energize, &gt;&gt; to strengthen, to help us. Aren't you glad we have a church where angels can visit? &gt;&gt; I hope you have a home that angels also can visit cuz they certainly desire to. &gt;&gt; [cough and clears throat] &gt;&gt; I just want to say how much we appreciated brother Matt being with us and just him submitting himself to the Lord. And I was so blessed by our brother and I'm sure that many of you were as well. Just appreciate him getting out of the way and coming. And I was just thinking again this week of another another youth service, another time that the Lord has made a way for us. And I was thinking it hasn't been that long really to where we couldn't have those. &gt;&gt; We couldn't have no special meetings cuz we didn't have a place big enough. But Jesus is mindful of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad? Aren't you glad we can have such meetings? [clears throat] Thank the Lord. [applause] Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's turn to Genesis 24 tonight. if you would. Genesis 24:E1 and remember our setting of it being a type of God sending forth a messenger to get a bride for his son. And Abraham was old and wellstricken in age. And the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things. And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had. Now, I'm sure that people think God's servants aren't really that important. We know there's people that feel that way. And you know, you can make it with or without them. It's no big deal. But maybe whenever you get to heaven, you could go up to Rebecca and ask her if it was a pretty big deal &gt;&gt; about listening to that man. He ruled over all that he had. And he told him, "Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth. Thou shalt not take a wife unto my son, of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell." Now, let me just say this tonight for our young people and anyone else, whether you're young or not, that's looking for a a companion, a mate [clears throat] in life. As your pastor, I'm not trying to tell you don't marry this one, don't marry that one, don't marry unbelievers, don't marry that because I'm trying to be mean to you or because I'm trying to control your life. What I'm trying to do is spare you of a life of hell &gt;&gt; being married to a Canaanite, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And so with your mom and dad, but thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son. So here's the three my country, my kindred, my son. &gt;&gt; So to me, that's a my my my. &gt;&gt; Right. I ain't too smart, but ain't that what you get out of that? My my my. That's how important is to God for you to marry a real word believer. And the servant said unto him, prayer adventure the woman will not be willing to follow me into this land, lest thy needs bring thy son again unto the land from which thou camest. And Abraham said unto him, Beware, beware. This is not a game. Well, maybe it'll work. I I just I feel it'll be okay. Beware. &gt;&gt; Beware that thou bring not my son thither again. The Lord God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that swear unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land. He shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence." Now, I'm not sure what you hear when you hear this read, but I'll tell you what, Ellie Ezer heard prophecy. &gt;&gt; Prophecy. &gt;&gt; So, he's asking him, "So, what am I supposed to do if I go there and I go through all this thing that you've told me to do and she won't come?" He said, "He shall send his angels before thee, and thou shalt no may, no perhaps, possibly. Well, if it don't work out, no big deal. His angel will go before you, and you will bring back that bride." &gt;&gt; Amen. And thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence. So I knew exactly where the bride was coming from. &gt;&gt; You know, really Jesus is not asking for that hard of a thing in this day. He wants a bride from among his people. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But everybody that goes to church ain't his people. &gt;&gt; Everybody that believes that they're Christians aren't his people. &gt;&gt; But they got to be of the same father &gt;&gt; and the same seed. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And the same nature. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Aren't you glad? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By his grace, he's made a way that we can be that way. &gt;&gt; How many like to be remembered tonight as we pray? You got a need, a request on your heart, a sickness, a burden, whatever it is, just hold it there in your heart, would you? Heavenly Father, we count it such a privilege, Lord Jesus, to be assembled once again in this house that you have given to us. again. My father, I want to say thank you. I know they probably hear me say it over and over again, and maybe it don't mean the same to them as it does to me, but I just want you to know how grateful I am that we can be able to host meetings and be able to have banquetss and youth services. And Lord, it did my heart so good to see youth here from the Carolas and Virginia and Arizona and I I I don't even know where all they were from. And I I'm just I'm just grateful, Lord, &gt;&gt; because I believe it was you that gave us this building and you wanted us to be able to host meetings. I want to thank you for all the work that the people done here, Lord, and everything that they have done to make the people welcome. And I just pray, Father, that you'd help us as long as as long as we're here that we can continue to do so. Now, here we've come again on Wednesday night. Most the visitors that went back home and it's just us, us home folk, but we realize it's regular home folk services that actually leads up to them special services. I believe with all of my heart every service can be a special one if we'll believe that it will be thus. So once again, we're looking for you to speak to us tonight. Lord God, may the angels of God come near us now, Father. May they find their place standing near your children. No doubt the war will begin. It already has. But as the word goes forth with the sword, then no doubt it intensifies. May the spirit of God minister to your children tonight, Lord. We pray in the name of Jesus. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." God bless you. You may be seated. So a father that would want to give a dowy to his daughter and he had the means by which he could give her unlimited resources. He could provide for her whatever he felt that she would need as she is beginning this new life together with her husband. He would give her no doubt whatever he felt that she would be required to have if they needed a start financially. No doubt he would. If they needed a better vehicle to be able to get about, a mode of transportation, no doubt he would. If he could give them advice, if he could give them some teaching, some things that would be a deposit that would help them in their new life together. No doubt he would do that. But what if that father had the ability to give to his daughter as part of her dowy? Angels from another realm that would accompany them their entire journey in life. Not only would they be beside them, but every now and then he would let some of his children actually break into angelic language &gt;&gt; and they would talk angelic tongues. And then whenever they would be in such straits at times that they didn't know what to do and they would need a real surge, he would send the angels down near them and they would be at a spot that they felt they couldn't go any farther. And all of a sudden, it wasn't seen. It wasn't tangible. It wasn't visible. But somehow another from a certain time they just felt different. &gt;&gt; It wasn't like maybe they felt like they could run through a wall or, you know, leap great leaps and bounds, but it was just something from within them that they felt they was going to be okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I know one thing. If I had the ability to give that to my two daughters, oh, I certainly would have. I wasn't a rich man when evil either one of my daughters got married and still am not. But I did try to help them. I tried to give them advice along the way. I would try to do anything that I could to help them, but I'm so limited. But what if you were God and you had access to everything that was good, everything that was righteous, everything that was pure. And you make up this plan actually before the foundation of the world. So you know that your children will be brought on the earth after Adam and Eve and unregenerate states and they'll be facing so many things in life. So you predetermine that you will allow their angel to stand before your throne as a representation of them while they are absent from that body. You will actually allow your children once they come into their new land of the new birth to be encompassed by an innumerable host of angelic beings &gt;&gt; and they will actually busy themsel over you. Well, I'll tell you one thing. If I had that kind of power, I'd certainly would allocate it to my young ones. I don't know of a thing that you could give to them after you redeem them. And then father decided to make these beings to be an immediate relation to the individual. Watch this. In Matthew 18:10, "Take heed that you despise not one of these little ones. For I say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven." Their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven. Now to me this is absolutely overwhelming since no man has ever seen the face of God. &gt;&gt; But your angel has. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, actually, what is your angel? Question answers 61. Mistreat a child. You should never do that. They're children. They don't know. See, and now notice, because their angels always behold my father's face which is in heaven. In other words, their angels, their their messengers, their bodies, angelic bodies that they go to if they die. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You see, God believes in predestination. So he ordains your angel to be there before you'll ever get there in a corporal body. &gt;&gt; So if you've got an angel there, sounds like to me your destiny is pretty secure. &gt;&gt; I told you your Sunday after brother Matt preached, your name's already there. You got a body already there. Sounds like to me you're going to be there. &gt;&gt; Now notice what your angel then, this one is. Now this is not your guardian angel. This is your angel. &gt;&gt; You see there are angels of the Lord but there's only one angel of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You those of you that read the Old Testament, you know that it is used several times in the singular form and in the plural form. So the singular form predated the existence of Jesus as a man on the earth. What was it? God's own being in the angelic realm. The theophonyic appearance of God. Now watch. The prophet said THE MESSENGERS, THE BODIES, THEIR BODIES, angelic bodies that they go into if they die, they're always before my father's face in heaven. But you now you realize the devil doesn't have one of those. &gt;&gt; That's right. Neither do the angels that fell from his presence. Neither do unregenerate, unredeemable human beings on the earth. Only the elected, the redeemed has angels. As a matter of fact, that's one of the reasons you are redeemed &gt;&gt; because the deposit of that body which spun off of the eternal himself is the heavenly deposit before his throne and it has a counterpart on the first which was the seed of God that come into you when you took the breath of life. Oh, you say, "No, it didn't, brother Donnie. I I got the seed of God when I got born again." As a matter of fact, the reason you could get born again was because you already had the seed of God. &gt;&gt; We did not become sons and daughters by the rebirth. We were sons of God and daughters of God. That's how we were reborn. &gt;&gt; Now, I know there's a lot of message people that don't believe that, and I did call them what they are. They are message people. But if you're real bride people, you believe it. &gt;&gt; There's a difference between so-called message people and really bride people. Now notice then these angels are associated with you because it is your body, the angelic presence that you go into once you leave this life. Now God knew how many there would be. So he placed them on the lamb's book of life, not the book of life. because your name can be on the book of life and removed. But there's no way possible for one name to ever be blotted out in the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; So the lamb's book of life is associated with the angelic theophanes that stand before the throne of God. For every name there's a body and for every body there is a name. So there is a name, there is a body and there is a seed. Now what a different sphere these all are in. So the name is in the lamb's book of life, the lamb's personal diary. AND THEN THE BODY IS there before his holy presence before the throne of God. And then we when we come into this life and we receive that spoken word seed from God which goes into our soul and may lay there for decades, may lay there for years but then one day it becomes born again. Then when it does that puts you in direct communion to the heavenly sphere that your other two parts are already identified with. Now, I hope tonight this will make clear to you why the prophet said when you heard the word of God and you recognized it was eagle food, you left the other thing and you heard from your theophamy. &gt;&gt; Now you see friends, that's why people can come to the message and leave the message and turn against the message and make all types of YouTube videos and this and that and the other. And I feel sorry for them, you know. I really do. I feel sorry for them because for a lot of them, they'll never get back. They'll never have nothing to come back to. BUT YOU FEEL SORRY FOR them in the sense that they never heard from their theophony when they heard the message or they would have never left in the first place. Now, they heard it because it made sense. Well, the serpent seed makes sense and and this makes sense. This makes sense. That that's not what a bride member hears. that it makes sense. She hears from her theophony. YOU SEE, AS THE PROPHET TELLS us in the natural resemblance of this that when a man meets a woman and he falls in love with her and he don't know why and a woman meets a man and she falls in love with him and she doesn't know why. That is an eternal mate that stepped out of eternity together into a body called time. and one day they'll go back to eternity again. Now, God mirrored those of us who have our eternal mate in this life. God mirrored the divine family in the human family. So, what was it that got a hold of us when there was people sitting in the same church we were and heard the seals preached and heard the message of the hour preached and for some of them done absolutely nothing. For others, it drove them into further darkness. Some of them heard it, responded for a while, and then left and went back to the vomit they come out of. Amen. And yet you, it did something totally different to you. So it actually brought you to a state of an invisible union with your husband, Christ Jesus. SO WHAT WAS IT? YOU both were eternal mates that stepped out of eternity. But you see, he stepped out of eternity as well and come down to be able to produce a chemistry, a blood that would be able to wash you by the waters of the bloody bleeding word and redeem you with the word of life and bring you back. Will he come before you? But knowing that you would follow him. So when you come to the earth, you stagger around. You go to this church, that church, you're lying, you're drunk, whatever you were. But one day, the light of God struck your heart. THEN WHAT HAPPENED? You well, you know what? You met your mate, Christ, the word. NOW YOU SEE OTHER PEOPLE, THEY THEY heard a tape. They thought that was a good sermon. They read a good book, but they never met their mate. It's not like that it joined up something with them from their soul. They were happy for a while, but alas, they got to looking for another husband. And that's what they found. Why? Because the first one was not dead. But for those of you that have found that the anointed word Christ is the Messiah, your hunt for the Messiah is over. &gt;&gt; Friends, this is why a lot of the message folks are still hunting for a Messiah. I'm telling you tonight, the search is still on in this message. That's why some people will rally around this man and that man or this woman and that woman or this church and that move. You know why? They're still searching for a Messiah. But if you have found that Christ the Word is your anointed Messiah, your husband, then your search for the Messiah is over. You're not looking for another Messiah. Thank God you found him and y'all got married. &gt;&gt; Now would you notice how Paul deals with this as well that we are associated with these angelic beings with the redeemed in heaven. Watch him in Hebrews 12:22. BUT YE are come unto Mount Sion. Now notice in the Old Testament, of course, a few places in the New. used with the letter Z, but here it's used with the letter S, which is Greek. So you are come unto Mount Sion and unto the city of the living God already. ALREADY ALREADY, NOT YOU'RE GOING TO, but already you have come unto the Mount Zion. SO WHAT IS THE MOUNT ZION? The church of the living God. Now notice he goes on to say and unto the city of the LIVING GOD. WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT CITY? WHAT what is the city? JESUS SAID YE are a city set on a hill. Praise the Lord. So here Paul is bringing the further identification to the new Jerusalem. Of course will be a literal one but here it is a spiritual one. You're common to Mount Zion, unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company OF ANGELS. NOW, PAUL SAID, "For those that have already been born again, you have already arrived to this state." Oh my. Anybody believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; So, look what you've COME TO. BUT YE ARE COME, not coming. Ye are come unto Mount Zion, unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels. Oh, if the highest INTELLIGENCE OF the angelic realm purge, oh, they they look down and they peer into the supernatural ELEMENT OF GOD dealing with man on the earth. And they see through what God is dealing with his human beings, a display of the wisdom OF GOD THAT THEY DO NOT SEE in the stellular heavens. NOW, THEY LOOK AT the moon and they look at the all the great stars and all the awesome things that God did out there, but they don't see the blood. They don't see the cross. THEY DON'T SEE MANY THINGS THERE. It's hid, of course, in symbols, BUT THEY DON'T SEE IT. SO, GOD DID NOT PUT IT THERE AS A BOOK BY WHICH he could teach the angels from, but he places us on earth and said, "Now watch me as I deal with them, and you will learn great things. So if them looking at it brings such profound reverence that they stoop down as I've shared with you several times already and the word that Peter used is they look into which means to stoop down with earnest gaze to look into and they peer into that realm of what God is dealing AND IT PRODUCES SUCH AN AWE AND SUCH a reverence to the angels. angels, what ought it to do to us &gt;&gt; now? They will never even experience redemption BECAUSE IT'S NOT FOR THEM. THEY WILL NEVER experience salvation. Not one angel will ever get the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Not one angel will ever take on the name of the Lord Jesus and water baptism. Not one angel will ever be able to sit in the HEAVENLY PLACES IN CHRIST Jesus where we sat. THEY TRULY ARE IN HEAVENLY PLACES, BUT NOT WHERE WE ARE. IT IS OUR SOUL. It is a different sphere than where the angels of God have lived and walked for eons of ages of time. NOW, WATCH THIS. THE PROPHET GOES, I I love the way describes this. MAY THE ANGELS OF GOD COME DOWN into this city and the cities AROUND ABOUT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY visit homes stir people. &gt;&gt; Now I want YOU TO NOTICE WHEN WE HAVE a messenger that God raises up in the last day AND HIS COMMISSION WAS NOT GIVEN to him by Baptist church. IT WAS NOT GIVEN BY A BUNCH OF local elders that recognize a gift in this man's life, but his commission was given to him by angels. Now, how strange that it was for those of you that listen to tapes, AND YOU'LL NOTICE, BROTHER BRANDHAM, early on in the 40s, he goes to talking about angels and the angelic visitation. NOW, IT MUST HAVE BEEN VERY strange to the Pentecostals. Uh there was some of them of course that claimed angelic visitation. No doubt they may have had it. But brother Brandham had to actually put out really what we would call a disclaimer because he talked about the angel of God so much and he would talk about how he appeared to him and he showed him this and he showed him that and he even even said now in case you're wondering I don't worship that angel. IT MUST HAVE seemed unusual that a man would talk so much about a realm that the most of the church people understood so very little about. SO MYSELF, I'M GOING TO take the word of a man that dealt in the angelic realm more than I would those who don't. Oh, you mean YOU'RE GOING TO BASE THAT JUST UPON WHAT HE SAID ABOUT IT? YEP. Sure am. &gt;&gt; Whenever you get the credentials he had, then come and see me and I'll replace his quotes with yours. But until you do, I'm going to keep on preaching what I'm preaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Is that the WAY YOU FEEL TONIGHT? I REALLY DON'T care what the person has this opinion, THAT OPINION. I KNOW THE critics like to listen to me and they like to find fault and do this and that and the other and oh they about blow a valve every time that I READ QUOTES. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? THERE'S A FIX for that. You spies. If you spies don't want to hear me read QUOTES FROM THE PROPHET, DON'T STREAM OUR SERVICES. That's an easy fix because AS LONG AS I'M IN MY RIGHT MIND, I'M GOING TO QUOTE MALACHI 4. BECAUSE IF ID HAVE LIVED IN THE DAYS OF PAUL, I'D HAVE QUOTED PAUL. IF ID LIVED IN THE DAYS OF NOAH, I'D HAVE QUOTED NOAH. IF I'D HAVE LIVED IN ALL THE REST THEM TIMES, I'D HAVE QUOTED them men because the WORD OF GOD COMES to his prophets. &gt;&gt; Now notice, MAY THE ANGELS OF GOD COME DOWN INTO this city and the cities round about THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. Visit homes stir people. I want YOU TO NOTICE HOW THAT he identifies what what happens when the angels come and certain things that he would pray that WOULD BRING THE ANGELIC PRESENCE. Now then it makes me wonder as I've looked at this in the last oh I don't know several weeks however long it's been if you and I as the people of God should not begin to pray in the same manner and ask for the same thing. NOTICE AGAIN IT SAYS THE ANGELS OF GOD ARE standing in the AISLES TONIGHT. THERE THEY ARE AND THE GREAT HOLY SPIRIT moving up and down the aisles. I FIND IT amazing they weren't seated in the seats. YOU KNOW WHY they can't take your place? &gt;&gt; The seats belong to you. AND YOU KNOW WHERE THEIR PLACE IS? IN THE AISLES. Lord have mercy, CHILDREN. A PLACE THAT ANGELS OF GOD DON'T EVEN COME IN AND SIT DOWN BECAUSE OF REVERENCE AND BECAUSE OF THEIR POST OF DUTY TO STAND IN THE AISLES. AND GOD COMMISSS THE angels to stand in the aisles in the front and in the back. And God gives you a seat. And the angels are your custodians. THE ANGELS [screaming] ARE YOUR USHERS. Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THE ANGELS OF GOD ARE STANDING IN THE AISLES TONIGHT. OH MY. Notice again in the law having a shadow. He said God lets his angels have watch over us. THE ANGELS OF GOD ARE ENCAMPED ABOUT. THEY DON'T GO BACK AND FORTH. They stay here. &gt;&gt; I LIKE THAT. THE ANGELS OF GOD ARE ENCAMPED ABOUT those that fear him. Don't you understand, friends? He They may not let us see them. HE MAY NOT EVEN LET US SENSE THEM ALL THE TIME, but they are here. Oh, I'll tell you one thing. If we could grab a hold of that tonight, I don't care what the devil would throw before us, we'd look at things a lot different. I BELIEVE I BELIEVE A LOT OF THIS UNNECESSARY FEAR THAT WE ALLOW IN OUR LIVES by all kinds OF DIFFERENT THINGS. OH, WE WORRY ABOUT THIS POLITICIAN, that politician. We worry about this and that AND THE OTHER. I'LL tell you one thing. If we could understand the angels of God RIGHT HERE TONIGHT, I TOLD THE DEVIL TODAY, I just having a big debate with him and I told him to shut his mouth, not open his mouth till I say that he could. I TOLD HIM HE DIDN'T HAVE no control OF MY LIFE. HE didn't bring me on the earth. He has nothing to do with me leaving the earth. I'M ORDAINED OF GOD TO MASH HIS MOUTH TO TRUMP HIM DOWN IN THE DUST. I TOLD HIM THE church of the living God's GOING TO STAND ON THE LAST DAY. And there wasn't one thing he COULD DO ABOUT IT. OH, Y'ALL HEARD HIM WHINING BACK DOWN INTO HELL LIKE A LITTLE PUPPY DOG WITH HIS tail shot BETWEEN HIS LEGS. YOU KNOW WHY? YOU AND I, SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD, WE LIVE SO FAR BENEATH OUR PRIVILEGE AS A PEOPLE OF GOD. I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO ARGUE SO MUCH WITH THE DEVIL. BUT WE NEED TO PUT HIM IN HIS PLACE AND NOT ALLOW HIM TO OPEN HIS MOUTH AND SAY, "DON'T YOU GO TO TALKING BACK TO ME. SHUT UP, DEVIL, AND GET ON BACK DOWN TO HELL. I AIN'T GOT TIME TO FOOL WITH YOU TODAY. I'VE GOT TO SEE IF I CAN LET MY LIGHT SHINE. I GOT TO SEE IF I CAN TELL SOMEBODY ABOUT JESUS." &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. NOTICE THIS. IN THIS BUILDING HERE are evil spirits and war and Christians anointed AND THE ANGELS OF GOD ENCAMPED ABOUT THEM trying to interize ENERGIZE THEM. [clears throat] NOTICE, NOT WITH FEAR, NOT WITH ANXIETY, NOT WITH SADNESS, NOT WITH SORROW. ENERGIZE them with faith. &gt;&gt; BROTHER DONNIE, I THOUGHT FAITH COME BY HEARING AND HEARING BY THE WORD. SURE IT DOES. BUT FAITH ALSO SOMETIMES needs an energy, &gt;&gt; an angelic energy. &gt;&gt; Oh, how many's ever been there? Well, yeah, Lord, I know it's a true God. I know your word is true. YOU CAN'T LIE, LORD. AND WE'RE SAYING IT OVER AND over and over again. And then all of A SUDDEN, SOMETHING COMES from somewhere and you just feel an energy that comes in there. WHAT WAS IT? Your angel was STANDING THERE BY YOU AND God just let him zap you with it. &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. LET THEM ENERGIZE them with faith. I thought that was an awesome example that brother Matt used on Sunday about being shot by electricity. How many's ever been shot by electricity? Oh, it'll it'll light you up ON IT. OH MY. IT'LL LIGHT YOU UP. WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE SPIRIT OF GOD? THE DEVIL, MY HE KNOWS ENOUGH about this word to know. He can tell whenever we're just quoting the logos, the logos, THE LOGOS, AND WE'RE GETTING DISCOURAGED ABOUT IT. But Lord have mercy, WHEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD GOES TO ENERGIZING THAT WORD AND TAKES THAT LOGOS AND MAKES IT a rama word for you. A RAINBOW WORD IS THAT LOGOS TRANSFORMED, ENERGIZED, and becomes a living word for whatever you have need of for the hour that you're in. &gt;&gt; Oh my. NOTICE THIS. WHAT A GREAT THING that it is TO KNOW THAT TONIGHT, RIGHT IN THIS BUILDING, there is angels [screaming] of God standing. [clears throat] Oh my goodness. So, you mean they don't come to church and snooze? They don't come to church and text. They don't come to church and write notes. And they don't come to church and say, "Wonder how many pages brother Donny's got on his iPad. Reckon how much longer we got? The kids have got to get up early in the morning. OH MY, THIS THEY'RE AT ATTENTION. YOU IMAGINE STANDING RIGHT IN THIS PLACE TONIGHT. THE ANGELS OF GOD AREN'T RELAXED. THEY'RE NOT SITTING BACK KICK BACK IN IN ANGELIC RECLINERS. THEY'RE STANDING AT ATTENTION. They're looking ALL OVER THE BUILDING. THEY'RE LOOKING BACK AND FORTH. WHY? THEY KNOW THERE'S DEMONS HERE. THEY KNOW THERE'S A WARFARE GOING ON. THEY ARE WATCHING YOU. THEY'RE WATCHING ME. OH, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; They know every word that we say and [clears throat] everything that we do. An angel came to a home. Zachcharias and Elizabeth. They were great renown believers. That don't mean everybody in the world knew about them. Being great and renowned in the eyes of God don't mean anybody here on the earth already even knows who you are. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. I'd rather be renowned in heaven than I would on the earth any day. Wouldn't you? THEY WERE GREAT RENOWNED BELIEVERS, Christians as to call. AND THAT'S THE kind of a home that an angel can get to. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK TODAY? THE REASON WE DON'T HAVE NO MORE angelic visitations than we do, we who call ourselves Christians, PLAY CARDS HALF THE NIGHT, &gt;&gt; READ OLD TRUE STORY MAGAZINES have beer in the ICE BOX. THAT'S the reason angels don't visit us. &gt;&gt; You can't mix oil and water. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, saints. AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOW, THESE ANGELS came into these homes when they were renowned homes. May God grant that Word of Life Church will be filled with renowned homes. Why renowned people living there? &gt;&gt; They go to a renowned church. &gt;&gt; They're going to a renowned city. They serve a renowned God. They believe a renowned message. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S OUR IDENTITY. NOTICE AGAIN, HE SAYS, "AND THE ANGELS ARE WATCHING OVER US DAY and night. They never leave. They're encamped about and we can expect God to do most anything at any time because &gt;&gt; of the presence of the angels of God who ARE COMMISSIONED BY him to watch and care for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. How would you like to know that you had angelic daycare? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Take care of the children. &gt;&gt; GOD ATTACHES THESE GREAT RENOWNED BEINGS TO WATCH OVER and careful. SO, BROTHER D, IF THAT'S SO, THEN WHY DO BAD THINGS COME OUR WAY? YOU THINK IT'S BAD. What would it be if they WASN'T THERE? &gt;&gt; OH, YOU I'VE WENT THROUGH TRIALS. I'VE WENT THROUGH THIS. YEAH, SO HAVE I. BUT I'M SURE GLAD THEM ANGELS HAVE BEEN THERE TO HELP ME. I'D PROBABLY BEEN WACKY AS A LUNATIC if it I'd be like a wrestle to see out OF MY MIND. THEY DON'T KEEP US FROM HARD THINGS. THEY DON'T KEEP US FROM GOING THROUGH TRIAL, BUT THEY GIVE US SUSTAINING STRENGTH. THEY'RE THERE TO ENERGIZE US. AND WHEN PAPA WILL SAY NO AND BREAK OUR HEARTS YET THEY ARE [screaming] THERE TO MINISTER TO US LIKE THE FATHER. OH HALLELUJAH. THE SPIRIT GOD WHEN HE REFUSED TO TAKE THE BURDEN AWAY FROM THE LORD JESUS DYING ON THE CROSS AND HE SAID FATHER NOT MY WILL BUT THY WILL BE DONE AND THE ANGELS OF GOD COME AND MINISTER TO HIM WHENEVER HE HEARD THE father say no. Sure. &gt;&gt; You're the only one that can do this. But Jesus, as a man, said, "I don't want to die. &gt;&gt; I don't want to die. I don't want to hang up there naked. I don't want my back to be beat. I don't want them to spit my faces or any other way." And when he accepted the know of God, God sent angels down in the garden of Gethsemane to minister to him and help him. It's going to be all right. It's going to be all right. AND WE CAN EXPECT GOD TO DO MOST anything at any [screaming] time. Look, children, you don't have to just BE A CHURCH. YOU'RE AT HOME AND ALL HELL COMES AGAINST YOU. YOUR ANGEL LIVES WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT LIVING GUESTS. COME ON, SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. [screaming] YOU'VE GOT LIVING GUESTS. NOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THEM. THEY DON'T SLEEP IN BEDS. THEY'LL NEVER BE in your chairs. THEY'LL NEVER TAKE YOUR FAVORITE CHAIR. BROTHER ROB, SISTER SARAH, NEVER HAVE TO FIX UP FOR THEM, BUT THEY'RE ALWAYS THERE. [screaming] IF WE'VE GOT RENOWNED HOMES, THE ANGELS OF GOD ARE THERE AMONG US. OH, I [screaming] WONDER HOW MUCH THEY'VE KEPT FROM US. I WONDER HOW MUCH THEY'VE HELPED US THROUGH THINGS. AND WE WONDERED, OH GOD, AND WE WENT TO BED ONE NIGHT SO WEARY AND SO WORN AND WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING LIKE IT WAS A DIFFERENT WORLD. IT AIN'T NO WONDER. ANGELS ARE SENT DOWN AT NIGHT AND THEY PROBABLY TOOK THEIR HAND AND RUBBED YOUR BROW and you were SO WEARY AND SO WORN AND SOMEHOW THE NEXT MORNING WHEN YOU GOT UP, how you feeling today, honey? I'm feeling better. Praise the Lord. I'm feeling better today. WELL, YOU READY TO TAKE ON THAT DEVIL? HO HO. NOW, I DIDN'T SAY I'M FEELING THAT THAT MUCH BETTER, BUT I'M FEELING BETTER. WHAT WAS IT? THE ANGEL JUST KIND OF STROKED YOUR BROW ALL NIGHT. IF YOU'D BE ABLE TO LOOK INTO YOUR ROOM AND SEE THEM THERE AND THEY'RE looking at you, Father, be mindful of them. Be mindful of them. &gt;&gt; Can I give them some of my strength? Can I be able to to give them a little something? Father, this is really hard on him. Can I help him? Go ahead. And you finally go to sleep and image over. Oh, you don't know how much you're loved. Just rest. Rest there, little daughter of God. He loves you so much. Oh, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. BECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE OF THE ANGELS OF GOD WHO ARE COMMISSIONED. Brother Brandon wasn't the only one &gt;&gt; that was given an angel with commission. God ordains his angels or let me say it this way, your angels. They are commissioned from Almighty God to come down and minister to you. Commissioned by him to watch and care for us. THOU FATHER, WE PRAY THAT THE ANGELS OF God will take their place tonight by the side of each believer. Their position is by your side. Think of it. WE WHO WERE LOST, WE WHO WERE WITHOUT THE COMMONWEALTH OF ISRAEL. And yet God so redeemed us that he commissions personal angels by each one of his children who says this is your post of duty for the rest of their life. Never leave them. NEVER LIFT THEM OUT OF YOUR SIGHT. Even in hard times, even in difficult times. Seldom of the ever fine one. Talking about people say THEY'RE CHRISTIANS. THAT'LL LAY DOWN HIS LIFE FOR THE CAUSE OF CHRIST. HE WON'T EVEN CRAWL OUT OF HIS SHADE TREE TO go to church. &gt;&gt; Wow. This prophet believe in going to church. Huh? &gt;&gt; I don't understand them. And I press play on this and I hear him say go to church and other people press play and they don't believe you have to go to church. &gt;&gt; I'm glad my version says this. &gt;&gt; WON'T EVEN GET OUT FROM BEHIND THE television long enough TO ATTEND A WEDNESDAY NIGHT PRAYER MEETING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. [screaming] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; That's right. AMEN. IT'S A SHAME. &gt;&gt; DISGRACE. &gt;&gt; Word of life said, &gt;&gt; "That's the reason angels don't visit the churches." You understand? Angels don't visit every church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And if we want to keep the angels of God away from our church, &gt;&gt; these are the things that'll do it. We disrespect his house. We don't reverence his presence. Oh my. We've got to get down to deep sincerity of this thing. THE ANGELS OF GOD ARE HERE ON EARTH tonight just the same as they've always been. Now, I wonder how many people here tonight, who have the Holy Ghost, who have spoken in tongues of angels. Now you see there's languages that we can speak in tongues with which are to be interpreted. But then there's also an angelic tongue or tongues which are not to be interpreted. But in the time of need for someone, an angel can come near and begin TO ANOINT A HUMAN being in that realm and they begin to speak in a tongue that they do not know or understand. And it's actually THE ANGEL HELPING them to speak a message to heaven, &gt;&gt; not using their own tongue, but angelic tongues. &gt;&gt; Boy, y'all are listening to me tonight, ain't you? That's good. I don't see nobody sleeping tonight. PRAISE THE LORD. NOW WATCH 1 Corinthians CHAPTER 13:1. THOUGH I SPEAK WITH TONGUES OF men &gt;&gt; and of angels. &gt;&gt; SO YOU MEAN PAUL had spoke in angelic tongues? Wow. And he said, "Have no charity. I become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol." Now watch question answer 61. AND THE PROPHET SAID PAUL over here also in the Corinthians where you're asking here and he said THERE ARE TONGUES OF angels and there are tongues of men. Now tongues of angels IS WHEN A MAN'S PRAYING TO him to him and God alone. But when he's speaking a language it's to be interpreted in the church for edification. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; of the church. Now there's lots of times in our services I see as it's moving [snorts] and I WATCH THE SPIRIT OF GOD AS IT MOVES AND I SEE SOME of you you start talking in tongues BUT IT'S NOT necessarily a language tongue which is to be interpreted for the benefit of the church. Then that's why we're to hold our peace as far as in a public way. Right now, a person worshiping, standing there worshiping, praising God, not interrupting anybody. Now, watch the prophet give us an example of this. THERE'S TWO different tongues. Tongues of angels. That's a man in private prayer OUT YONDER somewhere speaking to God. Now, for those of you that have had this experience, you know, it it is it is it's something. That's just all I know to say. It it is something OUT YONDER somewhere speaking to God. SPEAKING TO GOD in angelic tongues. So then the spirit of God would move in our assembly [clears throat] for gifted people and then someone would speak in tongues and someone that would have the gift of interpretation. We know the way the prophet taught that it should be done. If they are speaking in a language, say they would be speaking in Aramaic or Greek or Hebrew or Spanish or you know could be all kinds of different languages. If it's to be interpreted, it will be a language which can be interpreted. And if there's no interpreter, they're to hold their peace, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But now a person gets into a spot, maybe they're driving down the road, maybe they're in prayer, maybe they're right here in church, AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVES ON THEM, AND IT'S LIKE THEY they feel like they're fixing to leave this place, and they break out into this language, and it's just them and God. They're not they're not there. They're not hindering anyone else. They're not making a a big thing and interrupting the service and yet they don't know one clue what they're saying. And they are talking and saying all kinds of words and they don't even know what it means. Well, you see, there's times that the angels might need to borrow human voices &gt;&gt; CUZ THERE MIGHT BE SOMEBODY IN REAL need and a prayer of a son of God or a daughter of God would go a million miles beyond the prayer of an angel. &gt;&gt; But the angel can come near and so anoint that person. [panting] That's a man in private prayer yonder speaking somewhere speaking to God. speaking to God in angelic tongues. I could just call you a case right now, but haven't got time. I'm glad he went ahead and took time after saying that. You remember when the WOMAN COME TO THE AUDITORIUM THERE AND where Dr. Alexander Dow is from and Zion remember down there and Billy come down after me to get me to go to the meeting. I said, "Billy, go on back." He said, "What are you crying about?" said somebody been here. I said, "No, SIR. GO ON BACK. TELL BROTHER BAXTER TO PREACH TONIGHT." I GOT DOWN ON the floor and I said, "Lord, what's the matter with me?" ALL OF A SUDDEN, I HEARD SOMEBODY AT THE door speaking in other languages. I thought it was German. And I thought, well, that fell's come up to get him. I stopped, you know, praying and I listened at him. I want you to listen now how he describes this. So he hears what he thinks is someone speaking in a foreign language and he stops praying to listen to the individual. And I listened at him. Oh children, I listen at him who I listened at him standing there like this and I thought, now notice these WORDS ARE COMING OUT OF HIS MOUTH. BUT HE'S THINKING SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN THESE WORDS. How is that even possible? And I thought, well, how that guy will ever understand that? Cuz I I know the man that run that motel. I was about 5 milesi out of the city, you know, and I had to go out there so many people around small town. And I thought, well, that's strange. Well, boy, did you ever hear, "WELL, THAT GUY DON'T EVEN GET HIS BREATH HARDLY." Now he's thinking this the whole time. But [screaming] he's that guy. But there's another being there with him. There's another being in the room. Well, that's strange. Well, boy, DID YOU EVER HEAR THAT GUY DON'T EVEN GET HIS BREATH? He don't EVEN GET HIS BREATH. HARDLY. SEE, I was thinking that as hard as he was speaking. Listen at him. IT'S LIKE HE'S TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE. WHY? Cuz it was. There's someone else in your in this room. Oh, I just kept real still. He He didn't say any. I just kept real still. And after he got through speaking, he got through speaking. [laughter] And when it did, IT FELT LIKE I COULD RUN THROUGH A TROOP AND LEAP [screaming] OVER A WALL. when he got through speaking and I went out and Billy was going out the gate and I hollered at him, "Wait a minute." [snorts] He come back and he'd been drinking a soda pop. And he said, "Daddy, what's the matter?" I SAID, "WAIT JUST A MINUTE. JUST A MINUTE. I'M GOING WITH YOU." I STARTED WASHING MY face [laughter] real quick. He said, "WHAT'S THE MATTER?" HE KNOWS BETTER THAN TO TALK TO ME GOING to the meeting. HE SAID, "WHAT'S THE MATTER?" I SAID, "NOTHING. NOTHING. NOTHING. NOT AT ALL. JUST GO AHEAD TO THE MEETING." WE WENT ON TO THE MEETING AND BROTHER BAXTER WAS SITTING THERE PLAYING NOTHING BETWEEN my soul and the savior. He come in and said, "Thought you wasn't coming." I said, "Sh." Went on up and just started preaching. When I got through, about the time I got through preaching, boy, it sound like somebody took the back of the building back there in a great big auditorium. THEY RAN AN EXTENSION MIC BACK THERE AND THERE was a woman back there walking UP AND DOWN THAT AISLE SHOUTING AS HARD AS SHE COULD SHOUT. COME TO FIND OUT, SHE HAD TB. THEY LEFT THE TWIN CITIES, ST. PAUL. THE AMBULANCE WOULDN'T BRING her because they was afraid she'd burst her lungs. AND THE DOCTOR SAID ANYTHING HER LUNGS WAS LIKE HONEYCOMBS. And if they ever broke SHE'D BE DEAD, THEY'D BE ALL some saints took AN OLD 38 CHEVROLET CAR AND TOOK THE BACK SEAT AND FIXED IT UP. Put her in there and was on the road over AND THEY HIT A LITTLE BUMP OR SOMETHING OR ANOTHER AND SHE STARTED HEMORRHAGING. AND SHE STARTED SPURTING BLOOD OUT. IT WAS GOING TO HER NOSE. [snorts] She got weaker and weaker. SHE DIDN'T WANT TO DIE IN THE CAR. SO, SHE TOLD HIM TO STOP AND PUT HER ON A grass plat. And they picked her out. And they was all standing over praying. And all of a sudden she said something struck her. &gt;&gt; Oh glory. [snorts] Oh may pass by this way tonight and strike some of you all. [snorts] Something struck her. Hallelujah. And she got up and away she went shouting down the road. Hallelujah. As hard AS SHE COULD. HERE SHE WAS AT CHURCH JUST WALKING UP AND DOWN THOSE AISLES. I SAID, "SISTER, WHAT TIME WAS THAT?" Just exactly the same time, the Holy Spirit was speaking through me. What was it? Gifts. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Gifts. You mean we as saints, WE MAY NOT EVEN BE ABLE TO SPEAK OUR OWN MOTHER tongue very well. WE MIGHT BE SO IGNORANT THAT PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH TO HEAR US TALK. But in heaven, we have such rapport with God that God would tell his angel, "Give him your tongue. My daughter has a need." Father, you want me to say it? I don't want to hear you say it. I just want you to give him your tongue and let him say it. [snorts] BECAUSE YOU SEE IN SOME ways our position is greater than the angels of God. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; When we're singing in the redemption stories and the angels will bow their heads. Don't know what we're talking about. Sure, they never was lost. They don't know what it is. They don't know how good we feel to know we were once sinners and alienated from God. without hope, WITHOUT MERCY FROM GOD, WITHOUT GOD. OH MY. WITHOUT GOD, in a world of corruption, DYING, GOING TO A DEVIL'S HELL, and God stooped down and picked us up &gt;&gt; AND REDEEMED US, and now we're above the angels &gt;&gt; right now. It ain't no wonder the devil don't want you and I to see who we are. &gt;&gt; If it can get us so busy with life and sickness and affliction and one worry after another and one frustration after another and get us constantly caught up in just the element of time instead of a sin, we are called to do things like this. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. WHICH IS IT? AN ANGEL'S A SERVANT. WE'RE SONS AND DAUGHTERS. WHICH IS THE MOST THOUGHT OF, YOUR servant or your son or daughter? Oh my. Prayer from a saint &gt;&gt; will go a million times higher. that an angel. So you mean your prayer of you saints which have mistakes and failures and faults and flaws. And yet if you ask Father for something, your prayer, Brother Joe, WOULD GO A million times higher than an angel which has never lied, never sinned, never fell short of the glory of God. &gt;&gt; But in all reality, how many of us believe that statement? Amen. &gt;&gt; Or do we go to God in prayer, shamefaced? &gt;&gt; Do we go to God like slaves and servants? Do we go to God only with crumb mentality? We're living in a day, my friends, when the seven course meal has been served. I'm not interested in seven crumbs. I want the seven course. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; If God wants TO HAND ME A CRUMB, I'LL TAKE IT. BUT IF he wants to hand me a seven course meal, make room for me at the table. Praise be to God. IF GOD'S GOT SALAD AND SOUP and whatever more and he's got the entree and he's got the desserts piled a mile high, bring them on, God. If my name's on that place, I love it whenever I go to weddings and things like that. And I've been to them, you know, in different parts of the world and when banquetss and things that we have and they'll say, "Never brother Donnie, we have a special table for you and Sister Carol and we'll get in there." Generally Carol finds it first and see where we are and I all I got to do is look for her and there she'll be waving. I go over and I sit down. You know what? They may have brother so and so and brother so and so, but I know exactly where to sit down and I find my name and I find my wife and she found her name and my name and I know where I'm supposed to be by her side. If we as THE CHILDREN OF GOD COULD EVER FIND OUR NAME, WHO WE ARE, WE ARE NOT WRETCHED LOST SINNERS. WE ARE NOT A BUNCH OF TRASH. WE ARE THE ELECTED OF GOD. WE ARE THE REDEEMED BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. AND IF WE FIND OUR NAME AND FIND OUR HUSBAND, WE'LL FIND OUR PLACE AT THE TABLE. NOT UNDER THE TABLE LIKE A DOG. [applause] &gt;&gt; [gasps] &gt;&gt; Which is the most thought of, your servant or your son or your daughter? Oh my. Prayer from a saint will go a million miles higher than an angel. Yes, sir. Because he's a son. Oh, that's right. My brother, sister, the church. I don't believe this side of eternity. I will ever realize what you are. THE POSITION THAT YOU ARE THAT GOD HAS PLACED YOU. YOU SPIRITFILLED PEOPLE. You're sons of God. WHY? ANGEL'S A SERVANT. You're a son. Isn't this an angel can only bring you a message, but you have to act. &gt;&gt; Don't you understand? In every age, the actors have been on the scene. AND THE ANGEL OF GOD, DON'T YOU SEE WHY THE BREACH had to preede the opening of the seals even in 1963? And when the angels come and the prophet AT THE END OF IT TELLS US each angel came each day bringing the message that was made known unto him. So Paul's THEOPHONY BROUGHT THE ANGELIC message &gt;&gt; of the first seal. &gt;&gt; YES SIR. &gt;&gt; THE SECOND DAY, THE SECOND CHURCH AGE MESSENGER, THIRD, FOURTH, FIFTH, SIXTH. But can you imagine on that seventh day into the seventh seal when the prophet of God is there praying and into the room don't come Peter, James or John, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Who was it? Him. Right. &gt;&gt; Well, I better call 911. Somebody's going to pass out. &gt;&gt; The mystery. He was caught up INTO THAT PYRAMID OF THOSE SEVEN ANGELS. AND HE SAID, "THAT noted angel." Remember I told you that noted angel with had his wings all pointed back. The one that looked all noted, he seemed special to me. &gt;&gt; That seventh angel. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Now, &gt;&gt; I imagine I'd really be fired up if I seen your angel, BROTHER RANDY. SISTER JANET, I IMAGINE I'D BE FIRED UP IF I seen your angel. But I'll tell you who'd fire me up more than seeing yours, Brother Larry, would be my own. Hallelujah. YOU IMAGINE WHEN THE PROPHET OF GOD WAS CALLED UP INTO THAT CONSTELLATION of the seven angels and then each angel came each day, HALLELUJAH TO GOD, AND BROUGHT THE MYSTERY OF GOD. YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS, FRIEND? THE PREACHING OF THOSE SEALS WAS CHRIST. THE WHOLE WORD WAS [screaming] CHRIST. AND THE THING HE SAID I WONDERED ABOUT MY WHOLE LIFE. THAT SEVEN SEAL. WHAT WAS IT? AN IDENTIFICATION. A RELEASING OF TEARING OFF THE SEALS. ALSO A RELEASING of angels. HALLELUJAH. A RELEASING OF ANGELS. Oh Jesus. Let's stand. Let's stand. [applause] &gt;&gt; An angel can only bring you a message, but you have to act. Amen. You're the actor on the scene. &gt;&gt; You're the son. The angels of servants to bring you the message said here I brought you this message for you to do so and so. This is from father I bring it to you. Yes. That's that's all it is. Amen. You're your sons and daughters of God. Spoken words original seed. The unic been up with all the DDs and the LDS and everything. But why didn't he get something? He come back down studying the prophecy of Isaiah. Although an angel directed Philillip to him, &gt;&gt; but the germ of life &gt;&gt; had to come through the tape player when you press play &gt;&gt; and obey. &gt;&gt; If you believe and preach that, you're preaching damnable lies. tape player is not the token. &gt;&gt; It's being said &gt;&gt; that the message itself is the token. God's prophet told us the life of Jesus Christ was the token. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. That's what we believe at this church. IT'S THE LIFE OF THE LORD JESUS. NOT A BOOK, NOT A TAPE, NOT A PREACHER, NOT A CHURCH. AMEN. That's [applause and cheering] right. &gt;&gt; Although an angel directed Philillip to him, but the germ of life had to come through &gt;&gt; the body. Philillip, oh brother, now we're on the line. Where did the germ come from? Through the angel. The angel showed him where to go. An angel is a messenger. Here's a son. PHILIP HAD THE GERM. THE MESSAGE, &gt;&gt; the word. &gt;&gt; That's how a child can be born. &gt;&gt; Philip laid his hands upon him. Philip baptized him. Oh, glory to God. In the name of Jesus Christ, there come forth the spirit of God. Now, the germ had to come from the body. What body? Christ body. Correct. and Philillip [snorts] was a member &gt;&gt; of that body. &gt;&gt; That's why Satan don't want us gathering together. &gt;&gt; That's why Satan wants to get people disbelieve in the ministry in the end time. Come on, somebody. The devil knows you'll never get born again just by assembling somewhere AND PRESSING PLAY. AMEN. IT DON'T PASS THROUGH A TAPE. IT DON'T PASS THROUGH A MAGNETIC DEVICE. IT'S GOT TO COME THROUGH THE BODY. A TAPE PLAYER IS NOT A PART OF THE BODY OF CHRIST. A CD PLAYER IS NOT OF THE PART OF THE BODY OF CHRIST. IT MUST BE FLESH AND BONES THAT HAS BEEN REDEEMED BY THE POWER OF THE LAMB OF GOD. [applause] &gt;&gt; Can I read one more? NOW LISTEN. THE SAME THING TOOK PLACE IN ACTS 10:48. Peter was on the housetop. An angel direct him to Cornelius's house. But where did the word come from the body? Oh, I feel pretty good. Feel like traveling on. An angel come and said, "Don't worry. Don't call nothing unclean." Go on down. Look here. This angel had to come and bring him the message. But the angel couldn't go down there and lead these people to be born again. &gt;&gt; God had to use a faulty, frail human being. Why angels aren't part of Christ's body? Lord, children, &gt;&gt; ANGELS ARE NOT BAPTIZED INTO THE mystical body. &gt;&gt; EVERY ONE OF YOU TONIGHT THAT'S GOT THE HOLY GHOST HAVE GOT SOMETHING THAT ANGELS don't have. And whilst Peter spake these words, not the angel, not the cardinal, while Peter spake these words, what? He was the body. He had the word. The word took hold. Oh brother, whom don't you love them Harvard words. Oh my. OH BRETHREN. WOO. OH MY ANGEL DIRECTED IT. &gt;&gt; BUT the life come through the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; A tape player is not the body. &gt;&gt; I don't care how much you try to make it a live ministry. It is a recording. And always some man picks out which one he wants you to hear. &gt;&gt; That's the thing about sitting under a preacher. &gt;&gt; All of y'all don't get a remote and then when I go to saying something you don't like. You go. As I was saying, God knows why you all cannot live right. GOD UNDERSTAND. I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING. YOU GLANCE AGAIN. BUT Jesus loves you in spite of everything. And then you like that part. Jesus loves you in spot. No, preachers don't come with remotes. Well, yeah, they do, but he controls it. [applause] &gt;&gt; Think of it, children. You young people that are filled with the Holy Ghost, going to your school, going to college, going to your job, you go over and make pretzels and you make donuts and you you're bagging groceries and whatever that you're doing, walking down the miles at ETSU and feeling all by yourself. Don't you never think that &gt;&gt; there's a host with you? &gt;&gt; And you're packing the seed of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't you love it with all your hearts? &gt;&gt; Angels must inspire us, but we are the actors. We are the actors. Let's bury it. Young people, may I speak to you right now? Don't wait, young people, until myself and brother Daryl and these other ministers here till we all die and go off the field and then you all get on fire for God. Get on fire right now. Now is your time. If the Lord carries, there's future pastors wives may be here. Future evangelist wives, future deacons and deacons wives, but remember, you're part of that body right now if you have the Holy Ghost. And there might be somebody at the place you work or somebody at ETSU or the hospital or wherever it is that I'll never see. Brother Daryl will never run into him. And the only way they'll ever know about Jesus, the real Jesus, is through you. Oh, hallelujah. How many love to be remembered tonight? Lord, help me. I'm a housewife. I'm a farmer. Lord, I just pick up converters and take them from point A to point B. Lord, I I paint a house. I Lord, I I deliver propane gas. Lord, I I do this or that or the other. But you're a part of the body of Christ and you're packing his seat. Don't you understand, friends, what he's done different than he'd done to Eve? Eve only had her eggs, which left her womb fertile and left room for Satan to pregnant her. But Jesus not only gave us a soul, a womb, spiritual womb to be able to conceive seed, but he has sealed our womb. &gt;&gt; We cannot commit adultery. How can a womb be sealed when it receives the life from its mate? So we not only have the eggs that the church bears, but we have his life which has been deposited in us which seals us from adultery. &gt;&gt; But also gives us the power and the ability to propagate our husband. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And produce another son of God. Another daughter of God. Another son of God. another daughter of God. Lord Jesus, thank you tonight, Father. Oh Lord, thank you. I hope they don't think I'm beside myself. Lord, open our eyes. Help us to see. [laughter] Lord Jesus, we were once lost. We were wretched. We were blind but not anymore. We pack within us the very seed of our husband. Hallelujah. We have access access to the presence of God. And if we need it at times to angelic tongues, no doubt there's people right here in this place tonight that have witnessed it in their own life, maybe in their home, maybe in their closet, wherever they were praying, the spirit of God just come to them and they prayed and somebody come on their heart that didn't even know what they were saying. And yet the spirit of God moved. Oh Jesus. Lord God, we desire to have the kind of homes and the kind of church that your angels can visit. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. How many wants it tonight with all your heart? Would you just raise your hand to the Lord? Brother John gets in dinner, I don't know if you even know this or not, but many years ago, Brother John's sister was terribly, terribly sick. Sister Gail, Brother Wilson's wife, come to me again today, and Carol and I went to see her, and bless her heart, she was in terrible shape. We fell on her knees there beside the bed. and the spirit of God come in the room and I started speaking in a a tongue that I had never heard before. I never experienced before. I don't know how to describe it to you, but it's like the presence of God was just going to Sister Gail, but there was nothing said as far as interpretation of it. But that presence was there for I don't know how long and then it changed and in a few minutes another language went into into another direction and then from there it started speaking and an interpretation but not one word was said to sister Gail but it was all to brother Wilson to encourage him to lift him up to help him. Carol and I left our house there that day and we got in the car and she said, "Donnie, what'd you think?" I said, "It didn't seem like to me that she was going to live." She said, "That's what I thought from what the Lord was saying." Think of a children that we can live in his presence and walk with him. And if he needs to use somebody, you don't have to be a preacher. You mamas have got the authority. Your babies at home sick. You got the authority to lay your hand over on that child's head and rebuke that fever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't have to be just Brother Daryl. Oh, Brother Daryl's out of town. Oh yes, we've seen God do a lot through Brother Daryl. That same God wants you to have faith in Brother Daryl's in New Zealand or Australia that you got enough confidence in who you are as a son or daughter of God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. How many has needs tonight in the in the in the in in the church, your body, your home? You see these people standing around you, want you to lay your hand on them right now. Oh my. If we if God would allow our eyes to come open and we'd be able to see setting up down these aisles of the angels of God, oh man, we would we would scream and holler and we'd probably fall down and oh God, oh God, to see them angels here. But that man or woman that's got their hand on you, that young boy, that young girl, son or daughter of God, their prayer will go a million miles higher than that angel. We're going to pray for each other now. Heavenly Father, angels can inspire, but we are the actors. It's written in your word, they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover. And your prophet quotes that and said it didn't even say they'd have to pray. that just simply laid their hands on them. Why? They're a part of the body. Healing can flow out of one daughter of God into another. I'm reminded of that sister Lord up in brother Rand's meeting that time way up high. She kept seeing this little mother with this crying baby walk back and forth and she felt so sorry for her. She offered her her chair and she told her, said, "Honey, I I see you got a prayer card, but the Lord just keeps putting it on my heart. Would you mind if I prayed for your little baby? I know brother Ram's going to pray for." She said, "Why sure, sister?" She prayed for that baby. The prophet come out and preach that discernment. Calls a woman out and tells her, said that sister there standing by, you're sitting down near you. She prayed for your baby. The Lord's already healed your baby. Why God wanted to use a mother cuz she could feel what that mother could feel. Maybe a teenage boy tonight that's fighting a real battle. Maybe he needs to go lay his hand on another teenage brother because they got similar battles. Same with the young sister. Maybe two sisters going through the change of life and you'll put it on each other's hearts. Oh Jesus, I just pray you'd help us. Lord, that we can love like you love. This is why you became us, so we could become you. You wanted to feel our pain, our anxiety, our frustration. You become weary with life. You were sick, disappointed in people, and let down. Help me, Jesus, when I feel that way. Help my people, Lord, when they feel that way. We worship you, Lord God. We bless your name, Lord Jesus. May the angels of God They'll be able to energize our faith. Hallelujah. May they part their wings and distill drops of mercy. Distilled drops of healing. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. In the name of Jesus, may the oppressed be set free. May the weary be delivered. Lord God, we worship you now. Father, we call it done in the name of our bridegroom, the Lord Jesus. For we are mates who stepped out of eternity together in a body called time. And one day you will descend from heaven with a shout and you will call us out of time. And we will ascend back to heaven together eternal mates forever and ever and ever. And we will never part. Lord Jesus, we adore you, Father. We magnify your holy name tonight, Lord God. Oh Jesus, we worship you. Let's just love him a little. Now, children, if you got to go, go on. You got children, you work. I understand all that. I'm not trying to make it hard on you. But oh my goodness, with this presence that's here tonight. Oh, let's just just make it last as long as we can. I have to fight through hell to get to this. When I get here, I don't care if I leave. I don't care what time it is when we go. Oh Jesus, we worship you, Father. Hallelujah, Lord. Hallelu, Lord Jesus. Let's just raise our hands now if you will and close your eyes. If your hands get tired, sure, you can take them down. Take a rest and put them back up again. Sing something for us here. Let's worship him together now. Now, he needs you to do something. angels cannot do. That's act in his place. Now he's also asking something from you which angels cannot give him. Praise from redeemed lips. He's wanting you tonight to love him. He's wanting to take our hearts and be our lover, our Lord, our King. He wants to There's two little doves sitting on a power line when they lock their little necks around one another. And to you he would say, "I loved you before the world began." And you say back, "I receive that with all of my soul. My Lord, I don't ever remember you being anything but my son. or my daughter and you answer back, I believe that cuz my sins are in the depths of the sea. Now remember that sea metaphorically called the sea of forgetfulness. But one day there won't be no sea of forgetfulness like John saw no more sea. It won't be needed. Even you won't remember your sins. Let's coup to him. Let's love him. Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Hallelujah Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah Jesus. [music] I see &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, your angels Lord [music] &gt;&gt; hover near us. Lord God of [singing] the Lord is in [music] this place. [music] Hallelujah. Here. He's here. Holy, holy, [music] bless his name [music] again. He's here, children. Listen closely. [music] Hear him calling out your name. [music] You can trust [music] you [music] is [singing] here. Hallelujah.

Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; I see his coming. &gt;&gt; Your presence [music] is here. Your angels are here, Lord. Your [singing] deliverance is here. Your [music] saints are here, Lord. This is a sacred place. &gt;&gt; I [singing] know that there are angels [music] hovering [singing] all around us. all around us &gt;&gt; for the presence [singing] of the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Lord is [music] in this place. [singing] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's sing it together now. He is [music] here. Hallelujah. [singing] He [music] is here. Amen. He is [music and singing] here. Holy, holy, I [music] will bless his name again. He is [music] here. [singing] Listen closely. Hear [singing] him calling out your [music] name. Here [singing] you can touch [music] him. You will [singing] never be [music] the same. Oh Jesus, we worship you tonight, Father. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Father, right now I call the name, Lord God, of Sister Teresa Carter. Do you know what she's in need of this very night? In the name of Jesus, may the angel of God go to our sister, Brother Sam Wo. Father, in the name of Jesus, you see the need of our brother. Lord, I call Ellie's name tonight. Not able to come to church. May the spirit of God go there to her now, Father. others. Lord, no doubt prayer request was turned in for them that I didn't hear, but you know who they are. In the name of Jesus, would you go to your children, Lord? You so wanted us to be workers with you that you were standing there that day, the Lord of the harvest, and you told your disciples, "Pray that the Lord of the harvest will send labors into the field." And brother Brandham phrases it like this. And he says, there he was standing, the Lord of the harvest. And he said, "Pray and ask me to do what I know needs to be done." But you wanted them to ask you to do it. So we're asking you, Jesus, bring the last members of your bride in. Fill the last ones with the Holy Ghost. Lord, bring back backsliders, Lord Jesus, whose names are on the book. Lord, bring in the last ones so we can go home. Anoint your evangelists. Anoint your pastors. Anoint the teachers. Anoint men of God like never before. Lord God, may the sacredness of the hour begin with the ministry. I wonder, Lord, sometimes, and I just can't keep from believing that some preachers have lost the sacredness of what it means to be a preacher, the sacredness to stand behind this desk. They use it as a place to get even and to throw things at people and preach on people and settle scores. What a shame. What a disgrace that a preacher would use a pullpit for such a thing. Lord God, bring the ministry back to a sacredness. Father, oh, we've got the quotes of the message, but do we have the sacredness the messenger had? Help us, Father. Lord, the same with the leoty. You've given us this place, Lord. But may they realize this is a sacred place. This is a holy place. It's not a place to laugh and cut up. Oh, but God, angels are in this place. Your presence is here. Hallelujah. We're on holy ground. We are on holy ground. Thank you, Lord Jesus. We worship you tonight, Father. Praise be to God. Amen. How many can say it's been good to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you saints. I'm going to let you go. Sing something for us, Harry.
