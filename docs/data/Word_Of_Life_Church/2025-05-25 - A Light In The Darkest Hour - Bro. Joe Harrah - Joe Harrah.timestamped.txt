[12:55] we
[12:56] deserve. But I'm glad he's he is intent
[12:59] to the cry of his children if we just
[13:01] ask, if we not doubt, if we just
[13:03] believe. You know, we know we all facing
[13:05] things, going through things. I've not
[13:08] seen the devil work so hard as he has
[13:10] this year. But on the other hand, then
[13:12] I've seen some of the greatest miracles
[13:15] I've ever seen this year. We know it's
[13:17] time to get out of here, church. Amen.
[13:19] And we need to continue to be in church,
[13:21] read our Bibles, and pray because as
[13:23] brother Brandon said, that's the both
[13:25] most powerful thing that this the saints
[13:28] of God has is prayers is more powerful
[13:30] than any atomic bomb. So I'm glad that
[13:33] we've got a weapon that can defeat the
[13:35] Satan this morning. Let us pray.

[27:58] and Jude last week when we was dealing
[28:01] with all the sickness and hospital
[28:03] visits, your prayers were felt. I know
[28:07] that Facebook group for a lot of people
[28:09] gets might get on your nerves and people
[28:11] posting in there all the time and but
[28:13] when I post in there, I have the utmost
[28:16] utmost confidence that when I see a
[28:19] comment that says praying that that is a
[28:21] prayer that goes directly to the throne
[28:23] of heaven. And I appreciate each and
[28:25] every prayer that we got and I'm glad
[28:27] that we're all back healthy again. And I
[28:29] hope this song can be an encouragement
[28:31] to somebody. And uh we love you. We
[28:34] thank you
[28:36] [Music]

[28:47] hide the hurt written on your face.
[28:53] You're broken
[28:56] inside, longing for love's
[29:01] embrace. It might be a while before you
[29:05] smile, I know, cuz I fought that
[29:10] fight. And weeping may endure for the
[29:17] night, but it's almost
[29:22] morning. Joy will replace your

[30:12] you. And I have prayed to see the sun
[30:17] break free while the storm was still
[30:21] inside. So when the
[30:24] darkness consumes your guiding

[31:59] [Music]
[32:09] [Applause]
[32:42] It's good to see you again.
[32:44] I Good to talk to you again. Amen.
[32:48] I got handed
[32:50] the to come off the
[32:52] bench this morning. So, y'all pray for
[32:55] me. I always come out here feeling like
[32:58] I don't have a clue what I'm going to
[33:00] say. So, um I would appreciate your
[33:03] prayers. Um brother, what I've studied
[33:06] this for this morning, I've been
[33:07] studying all week and Wednesday, I went
[33:10] in there to save it and I started to
[33:11] change the
[33:12] title and then brother Daryl preached
[33:15] what he preached. And I always I don't
[33:17] know how other ministers do it, but
[33:18] whenever I've got a thought, I I like to
[33:21] get confirmation when I come to
[33:23] church. And brother brother Daryl
[33:26] started preaching on the burden of
[33:28] light. And I've never heard it put that
[33:30] way when he said read the scripture, ye
[33:33] are the light of the world. And then he
[33:35] said, uh, my burden is light. You are my
[33:38] responsibility.
[33:40] So, I never heard it like that before.
[33:42] But when you hear the title of my what
[33:44] I've brought this morning, you'll kind
[33:46] of understand why
[33:48] um I got confirmation for that. So,
[33:51] we'll get right into the word. Let's
[33:54] pray first. If you have a need, you want
[33:55] to hope before the Lord, please continue
[33:58] to remember um my wife's uh aunt's
[34:01] family in prayer. I'm sure they would uh
[34:05] thank you for that. So, let us pray.
[34:08] Heavenly Father, we're so thankful,
[34:11] Lord, for another time to sit around
[34:12] your word, Lord, to bring the words of
[34:16] life, Father. Lord, Lord, without your
[34:19] anointing, they're just words. But Lord,
[34:21] when you come, anoint them to our ears
[34:23] and our heart, Father. They're words of
[34:24] life. We're so grateful for that, Lord.
[34:27] Lord, they didn't come here this morning
[34:29] to hear me or any other man, Father.
[34:31] They come to hear from you cuz just
[34:33] about everybody in here come with a need
[34:35] this morning, Lord. that you're the only
[34:37] one that can meet that. I pray that you
[34:38] would set us aside, Lord. Use us as you
[34:42] will. Speak to the hearts of your people
[34:44] in Jesus name. Amen. If you have your
[34:47] Bibles, we'll turn to
[34:48] Isaiah 60. We'll read the first three
[34:52] chapters and we'll sit before we read
[34:54] anymore. I don't want to keep you
[34:55] standing.
[35:03] Isaiah says, "Arise and shine, for thy
[35:05] light has come. The glory of the Lord is
[35:07] risen upon thee. For behold, the
[35:09] darkness shall cover the earth and gross
[35:12] darkness the people, but the Lord shall
[35:14] arise upon thee. His glory shall be seen
[35:17] upon thee, and the Gentiles shall come
[35:19] to thy light, and kings to the
[35:22] brightness of thy rising." May the Lord
[35:24] add the blessings. You can be seated.
[35:28] Thank you,
[35:30] buddy. The scriptures,
[35:33] Isaiah's saying this, brother Brandham
[35:35] tells us in the message shalom that he's
[35:38] Isaiah was referring to the gross
[35:40] darkness of this
[35:42] age. You look all around us, it it's
[35:45] it's dark. There's no when you look at
[35:47] the government, you look at the lives of
[35:49] people, you see people leaving the
[35:50] message, going into every other thing,
[35:53] and you and it's it's the darkest hour
[35:54] that's ever been. We remember when
[35:56] brother brother Brandham there at the
[35:57] tabernacle drew up on the the board. He
[35:59] drew the church
[36:00] ages and remember he talked about he he
[36:03] had made it all all darked out and when
[36:06] God did it in the skies he put a little
[36:08] sliver of light in there.
[36:11] That was the bride.
[36:14] That little sliver of light is the
[36:15] bride. The bride is the only light that
[36:17] is on this earth today. Amen. Without
[36:20] the bride here there is no light.
[36:23] So in 2 Corinthians it says, "Therefore,
[36:26] seeing we have this ministry as we have
[36:28] received mercy, we faint not, but have
[36:31] renounced the hidden things of
[36:33] dishonesty, not walking in craftiness,
[36:35] nor handling the word of God
[36:37] deceitfully, but by manifestation of the
[36:39] truth, commending ourselves to every
[36:42] man's conscience in the sight of God.
[36:43] But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to
[36:46] them that are lost, in whom the God of
[36:49] this world hath blinded the minds of
[36:51] them which believe not,
[36:54] lest the light of the glorious gospel of
[36:58] Christ, who is the image of God, should
[36:59] have shine unto them. For we preach not
[37:02] ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord,
[37:05] and ourselves your servants, Jesus sake.
[37:07] For God who commanded the light to shine
[37:09] out of darkness out of darkness has
[37:11] shined in our hearts to give the light
[37:14] of the knowledge of the glory of God in
[37:16] the face of Jesus Christ. And brother
[37:19] Brandham says, and I'm going to read for
[37:21] the first part. I'm not I don't quote a
[37:24] whole lot, but if y'all take this kinds
[37:26] of a teaching lesson, I'm not much of a
[37:27] preacher and even less a teacher.
[37:29] So y'all, you know, just hang in there.
[37:34] Now keep your eyes on this church. In
[37:36] 57, God keeps his word. Brother Bram
[37:38] said, "Keep your eyes on this church.
[37:40] The devil's not putting this propaganda.
[37:42] It's not with the scripture. It's to
[37:45] confuse the mind of the unlearned, the
[37:48] unspiritual people. We are living in the
[37:50] most glorious day that people ever lived
[37:52] and yet the darkest day for unbelievers.
[37:56] Unbelievers right right now when people
[37:58] in the world, they they see no hope.
[38:00] They they see no hope for anything. They
[38:03] they they look at how the the the the
[38:06] countries are coming against each other.
[38:08] Nations are coming against nations.
[38:09] Exactly what the Bible says would
[38:11] happen. And people that don't believe
[38:13] this word are looking at that and they
[38:15] seem to way out. But we have a hope.
[38:18] Yes. And we are living in the most
[38:20] glorious day that any people has ever
[38:22] lived. And yet in the darkest day for
[38:24] the unbelievers, the most confusing time
[38:27] for they those who don't know. It's a
[38:29] remarkable as the day we're living. What
[38:31] a joy to know that your anchor
[38:33] holds today as we're approaching it in
[38:36] this dark evil
[38:39] time. So looking back at 2 Corinthians,
[38:43] we we look for for behold the darkness
[38:45] shall cover the earth. This is in verse
[38:47] two. And gross darkness the people, but
[38:49] the Lord shall arise upon thee. His
[38:51] glory shall be seen upon me.
[38:54] So this very word that you hold so dear
[38:56] to your heart, the light has shined in
[38:59] your age, in your day to open your eyes
[39:01] to this word. That's what you have
[39:03] grasped. That's what you've pulled into
[39:05] your to yourself there. If you're not a
[39:07] part of the bride, you know, there's
[39:09] there's nothing you can do to to go from
[39:11] day to day without
[39:13] this. This is some of you, this is it
[39:15] should be your favorite time of the
[39:17] week. Yes. Is to come to church. Yeah.
[39:20] To to listen to the word. It doesn't
[39:21] matter who's bringing it. It doesn't
[39:23] matter who's preaching it. If you get to
[39:25] the point where where you if your
[39:27] favorite minister is not there and it
[39:29] don't bother me if I'm not your
[39:31] favorite. It don't I'm I've got thick
[39:33] skin. But what I want to to me if if if
[39:38] God's not your favorite
[39:40] if you got a favorite,
[39:43] where does God fit in in that? That's
[39:44] right. Come on.
[39:47] So that's who you should be coming to
[39:49] listen to. Hear from God. There's so
[39:52] many times that you come and you can't
[39:54] get a need met in your life because you
[39:56] came listen to what a man had to say.
[39:58] Amen.
[40:00] So we we we come to to grasp another
[40:02] part of that light. And brother
[40:04] Brandham, it tells us that in in John,
[40:08] this is scripture in John has confused
[40:10] me in my entire life. I didn't doubt it,
[40:12] didn't disbelieve it. But in in John 12
[40:15] 40 says, "He hath blinded their eyes,
[40:17] hardened their hearts. They should not
[40:19] see with their eyes nor understand with
[40:21] their heart and be converted. And I
[40:23] should heal them. God says if they see
[40:24] it, I I have to convert them. I'll have
[40:27] to heal them. But I'm going blind their
[40:29] eyes. So I don't.
[40:33] This is the God that we we we said the
[40:35] would that all men be saved. This is the
[40:37] God that that that said John 3:16 that
[40:40] whosoever come unto him. Whosoever.
[40:44] That's right. Amen. But here he's
[40:46] saying, "I blinded their eyes so they
[40:47] would not be healed. I blinded their
[40:49] eyes so they would not be saved." Yeah.
[40:53] Yeah. Are y'all confused as me?
[40:58] But darkness had come upon the has come
[41:01] upon the the earth right now in in this
[41:04] age darker than any other time. That's
[41:06] right. People that you sat with in these
[41:08] pews have walked back into it.
[41:12] They've said, "This light is not for me.
[41:16] I don't need this light." And they've
[41:19] turned and walked away. Some of you,
[41:20] you're own families.
[41:24] And they've walked away from this light,
[41:26] yet you've embraced it. Amen. Yes, sir.
[41:30] They felt like they can't live with it,
[41:33] and you can't live without it.
[41:36] Amen. This is the
[41:38] light. They've listened for
[41:41] years. Let me explain something to you.
[41:44] People come in here and sit on these
[41:45] pews for years and years and years and
[41:48] don't change. Right? If they don't
[41:50] change, they haven't stayed the same.
[41:54] Come on. We look at them with our
[41:56] natural eyes. Come on. We see people
[41:58] living their
[42:01] lives 30, 40 years later. You think, you
[42:04] know what? They're still the same.
[42:05] They're still the same way they was 30
[42:07] years ago. No, they're not.
[42:09] If you have come under this light, come
[42:12] on now. And you have sat under this
[42:14] light, it's
[42:17] impossible not to change. That's right.
[42:20] Amen. One way
[42:23] or the other.
[42:25] Amen. So if you feel like you ain't
[42:27] changing,
[42:28] you need more light. You need light in
[42:31] your life. Yes. You need light to grow.
[42:35] If there's a seed in here, that light
[42:38] can't without light, that seed can't
[42:40] grow. Yes. There's no there's no light.
[42:43] It lays dormant. It lays dead.
[42:47] Yes. So, the people that have pulled
[42:48] away, they're they're living with a
[42:51] hope. Can you imagine? They might say
[42:54] they have faith, but they don't. If
[42:55] they've left this light, there's no they
[42:57] don't have God's faith.
[42:59] God will not interject his faith where
[43:02] light is not. That's right.
[43:05] Amen. So they're they're living on a
[43:07] feeble
[43:09] hope. They're they're
[43:12] hoping what they walked away from was
[43:14] wrong.
[43:18] What a miserable place to be.
[43:21] Living your life without light,
[43:23] hoping that the light you
[43:27] left was wrong. Yeah,
[43:32] that's sad state to be in. Every morning
[43:35] you wake up. That's why you see people
[43:38] trash this message that they've walked
[43:40] away because they can't get rid of it.
[43:44] All they know that light is out there.
[43:49] They've walked away. They've shut the
[43:50] door. They tried to live their life.
[43:51] They tried to ignore it. But once light
[43:55] has shined in your life, if it ever
[43:59] shined in your light one time and you
[44:00] looked upon it, you'll never forget it.
[44:03] Because let me tell you,
[44:06] the day of judgment, you're going to
[44:07] look at it again. Amen.
[44:11] You're going to see it again.
[44:15] People have just turned it
[44:17] away, walked away from it.
[44:22] God blinded their eyes. Brother Brandham
[44:26] tells us in a quote, I know if I've got
[44:28] it in here
[44:29] somewhere, he blinded the eyes of Israel
[44:31] back in that day.
[44:34] Amen. They didn't recognize Jesus as the
[44:36] Messiah. Brother Bram said he blinded
[44:38] their eyes for you.
[44:42] He blinded their eyes so he can give you
[44:44] the light. Amen.
[44:49] This is the same God that desired that
[44:52] all men be saved, but yet he's saying,
[44:54] "I don't want them to see.
[44:57] I I don't want them to believe. I don't
[44:58] want them to
[45:00] hear." We ought to be so thankful that
[45:02] God has shown the
[45:04] light, that he's told us to arise and
[45:07] shine. As brother Justin was saying,
[45:10] there's a new morning coming. It's
[45:12] almost here. Amen. Yeah. It It's almost
[45:14] here. You You can You can see the the
[45:17] the light is getting brighter in the
[45:18] bride. How can it How can the light get
[45:22] brighter in the bride in this darkest
[45:23] age? Cuz the sun is coming closer.
[45:26] The sun is moving closer. He's got to be
[45:30] so close to take her hand and say,
[45:31] "Let's go." Amen.
[45:37] But Bram said in the
[45:39] Messiah, this is talking about the
[45:42] Jews, Jesus meeting all those
[45:45] qualifications and the Jews had read
[45:46] these promises for years. How did it
[45:49] ever slip on them and slip by them
[45:51] without seeing
[45:52] it? He's talking about Jesus the Messiah
[45:55] coming into their lives. The theologians
[45:58] there had had studied the scriptures.
[46:00] All the Old Testament, the prophets and
[46:01] the scrolls, they studied and it it said
[46:04] exactly who Jesus would be. Moses talked
[46:07] about him. Daniel talked about him. All
[46:09] the scriptures testified who Christ
[46:13] was. And all the theologians of that
[46:15] day, they totally missed
[46:17] it. They sat there and watched the
[46:21] miracles. They watched
[46:23] Lazarus raised from the dead. Yeah.
[46:26] Yeah.
[46:28] You've watched your loved ones raised
[46:30] from the dead spiritually. Yeah. People
[46:33] have seen loved ones in this age get
[46:35] healed. Amen. Get delivered. Get things
[46:39] they have need of
[46:41] and still deny the light. And so that's
[46:44] what these these theologians and the
[46:47] Jews were doing. These theologians so
[46:49] well read in the scriptures so
[46:51] particular with the scriptures and yet
[46:53] they failed to see him to be the
[46:55] anointed one. Yeah. It sounds though it
[46:59] would not
[47:00] happen. Looks like they would have known
[47:05] him. We've we've sat you've seen people
[47:08] come in here. I I'm in these in these
[47:10] prayer lines. I've seen people walk I've
[47:13] listened to people tell the
[47:15] minister, "If he'll do this for for my
[47:18] loved one or for me or whatever, I'll
[47:20] serve him." And God did it. And they
[47:23] never came. Oh, cuz they based on seeing
[47:27] the light with a stipulation,
[47:30] right? This is a stipulation. God says,
[47:33] "I want you to serve me with no
[47:34] stipulations.
[47:36] I want you to see the light. Let me be
[47:38] the light in your life without anything
[47:40] that you want that you have to give back
[47:42] to me or I have to give to you. It's
[47:44] unconditional. Yes.
[47:47] Yes, sir. Look at
[47:50] Abraham. God said, "Take Isaac up, put
[47:54] him on the altar, sacrifice him to me."
[47:59] Did Abraham say, "I'll do it, God, but
[48:01] if you'll do this or if you'll do that."
[48:05] Abraham didn't give God stipulations.
[48:09] Cuz Abraham had an unconditional love
[48:12] for God.
[48:14] You have to have an unconditional love
[48:16] for this light. Yeah. It doesn't matter
[48:18] how bad your life is financially, people
[48:22] in your in your family getting sick,
[48:24] backslid, dying,
[48:27] losing your job, whatever it is.
[48:30] Hallelujah. You don't say, "God, if
[48:32] you'll heal me, I'll come back."
[48:35] We don't say that.
[48:38] What is the healing? Healing is the
[48:40] children's bread. It's already yours.
[48:43] God God is not offering something that's
[48:45] not yours. He's just telling you where
[48:47] it's at.
[48:49] He's not saying that this is something
[48:51] that that you can have if you do this.
[48:53] It's already yours. This light of this
[48:56] age is already yours. When God put it in
[48:58] the
[48:59] skies and put then that that little
[49:02] sliver of light came in there, that was
[49:05] you. That was you living in Leotaa.
[49:13] But God blinded their eyes. It shows
[49:15] that this was the hand of God. He was
[49:17] too plainly known. His signs of Messiah
[49:19] proved him to be
[49:21] Messiah. Proved him to be the anointed
[49:23] one.
[49:24] And for them to miss it sure had to be
[49:26] the hand of God to blind
[49:28] them that they did not miss
[49:31] it where they would not have missed it.
[49:34] Rather, it's the same thing today.
[49:35] Today, if the gospel's hid, it's hid to
[49:37] them that are blind. Yeah. The only way
[49:40] they can receive sight is through
[49:42] God. I've talked to some of these these
[49:45] people in denominations and nothing
[49:47] against that. If if you feel comfortable
[49:50] going there, whatever. But I I've talked
[49:53] to some of them and I've got some
[49:54] wonderful friends and sometimes we we we
[49:57] talk scriptures, sometimes we don't. But
[50:00] when you ask them a question about why
[50:02] this or why that, they take you on this
[50:05] big long loop.
[50:07] Oh my. You don't know where they're
[50:08] going and they don't either.
[50:11] Cuz they're blind.
[50:13] Come on. I asked one one a gentleman one
[50:15] time, he's talking about miracles. God
[50:17] don't do miracles no more.
[50:21] So I I I sent him the the scripture
[50:23] where it says he put unto them apostles
[50:25] and prophets and m great miracles. The
[50:27] Bible says great miracles. Those are
[50:29] gifts to the bride.
[50:33] He sent me back a bunch of scriptures.
[50:35] Didn't one thing say about anything
[50:36] about what I asked him.
[50:39] Blind.
[50:41] Blind. There's people that truly love
[50:44] the Bible.
[50:46] They truly love the Bible. Yeah. They
[50:48] they they they can put our moral lives
[50:51] to shame.
[50:53] Some of them can put your lives to shame
[50:55] the way they live this live the Bible.
[50:58] I'm not saying the word. I'm saying the
[50:59] Bible. Yeah.
[51:02] They could put it to shame. But they're
[51:05] blind. The light of this age has not
[51:08] shined on their pathway.
[51:10] They're walking in blindness.
[51:16] See, the Jews had it all figured out how
[51:18] their king was supposed to come. They
[51:19] knew the genealogy of David. They knew
[51:21] that th that this king was coming
[51:24] through the lineage of David. Yeah. You
[51:27] know, and I like the way and I've
[51:28] probably mentioned it here before. I
[51:30] like the way that God hid it all the way
[51:32] through the the Old
[51:33] Testament through the lineage of David
[51:36] and the these these people when you look
[51:38] at it, you know, Satan trying to follow
[51:40] that
[51:41] seed, you look at David, David, David
[51:44] was a murderer. David was an adulterer.
[51:46] And then he you bring it on down through
[51:48] the kings that came through David's
[51:49] lineage. And whenever you you read the
[51:53] scriptures, this king so and so out of
[51:55] David's lineas did evil in the sight of
[51:57] the Lord. This one did evil in sight of
[51:59] the Lord. There's, you know, if you was
[52:00] if you were Satan, you're looking at
[52:02] that, you're thinking, there's no way
[52:04] there's no way that that seed of life,
[52:07] that God's seed of life is coming
[52:08] through that lineage.
[52:12] That's right. And that's what blinded
[52:14] these people. They were looking for a
[52:16] king.
[52:18] a king with a crown on his head to sit
[52:20] on a throne in Jerusalem to sit on a
[52:22] throne in in Judah and say this I am the
[52:25] king I will rule Israel now
[52:30] and that ain't the way he came
[52:33] he came even greater than that this was
[52:36] a king that would sit on the throne of
[52:37] their of their heart if they let him
[52:40] this was a king that would shine the
[52:42] light of the world to him if they let
[52:43] Yes.
[52:51] But Ram said, "To whom would we go now?
[52:54] You can go ahead and join church. It's a
[52:56] good thing. Or you can serve your
[52:58] creed." A good thing. You might belong
[53:01] to lodges. You might do these things. I
[53:04] have nothing to say against them. But
[53:07] I'm trying to say this. You need light.
[53:11] And this light is Christ. He is the only
[53:13] one that can give light. You might turn
[53:15] that light on and a bunch of dirt out
[53:17] here with ever so many grains of corn in
[53:19] it. That light will never produce life.
[53:23] That artificial light won't produce
[53:25] life. It takes
[53:26] sunlight. The rays in to bring it forth.
[53:30] Neither has the light of any creed,
[53:32] anything outside of Jesus
[53:34] Christ. That's the only light that can
[53:37] shine on this seed that God put down in
[53:39] here.
[53:40] That's the only light.
[53:43] You can't have a light of a creed, a
[53:45] dogma, a denomination, somebody's idea.
[53:49] If you're a seed of God, you need light.
[53:52] If you're a seed of God, you'll find
[53:54] light.
[53:55] Better yet, light will find you. Oh,
[53:57] yeah.
[54:00] Neither has the light of any creed or
[54:01] anything outside of Jesus Christ. He's
[54:03] God's light. He's the one that gives us
[54:06] the Holy Spirit. When we live in his
[54:07] presence, it makes us act different,
[54:09] look different, talk different, be
[54:11] different because we are walking in
[54:12] light. Children of light, you live in
[54:14] it. Bathe yourself in it. Joy, it's
[54:17] lifegiving flows. It's the reason we
[54:19] have to come to him to find it. You
[54:21] won't find it anywhere else. You won't,
[54:24] brother Ram says, you won't find it by
[54:25] some creed.
[54:30] Brother, some of these brothers I might
[54:31] not have in there. I
[54:34] apologize. All
[54:37] right. Brother Abraham said in shalom,
[54:40] I'll skip some of this. Gross darkness,
[54:43] the blinding of Israel was for the
[54:44] lightning of the Gentiles. Now, the
[54:47] blinding of the Gentiles is for the
[54:50] lightning of Israel. Yeah. Amen. Amen.
[54:54] Right. Gentile dispensation is about
[54:56] over. The light when this bride is
[54:59] called out of here, the light leaves.
[55:02] The light's over. It's gone. God won't
[55:04] leave a little piece behind for your
[55:06] loved ones that didn't make it. No.
[55:08] This light is over. He returns. He gives
[55:11] the light back to the to the nation of
[55:14] Israel. Right now, he's given light to
[55:16] individuals. It's an individual walk.
[55:19] You won't go and you won't see this
[55:21] light because you go to church here.
[55:24] You won't you won't see this light
[55:25] because brother Donniey's your pastor.
[55:28] It's an individual walk.
[55:31] And if that seed is here,
[55:34] that's the only thing you need to have
[55:35] faith about is that seed is here.
[55:37] Because if the seed is here, the light
[55:39] will find it.
[55:42] The light will find it. Now, the seed
[55:43] don't go out looking for you. Plant a
[55:45] seed in the ground. It don't claw its
[55:47] way out and go looking for light. No.
[55:50] Amen. It stays in this dirt right here.
[55:52] It stays in this dirt till all the
[55:54] clouds of your life move away and light
[55:56] shines down on it. Amen.
[56:00] That happens to you every time you come
[56:01] in here on Sunday. Every time you come
[56:03] in here on Wednesday.
[56:06] Hopefully, you're above ground now.
[56:09] Thank you, Lord. You're either better or
[56:11] you're worse, right?
[56:14] Why do some seeds die? They're not
[56:16] watered. They're a seed. They have a
[56:19] seed. Light is shining on them. Light is
[56:22] shining on them. They know that light's
[56:23] there. But if it's not watered by the
[56:25] word, it'll never grow. Amen. That light
[56:28] will burn it up.
[56:30] You got to have light in the water of
[56:32] this word.
[56:36] I hope this is okay. Yes.
[56:39] It's just like the day and night. One
[56:41] side has got darkness. The other side
[56:43] has got light. And then the light comes
[56:44] over on the other side. The moon passing
[56:47] by the way it did. The reflection of the
[56:49] darkness of the world blinding its light
[56:51] is a reflection to us that the gentile
[56:54] church age is finished.
[56:56] The church is making herself ready, been
[56:59] making herself ready for a time. It's
[57:01] time for the rapture. For darkness is
[57:03] fading upon the Gentiles. And I wish
[57:06] that'd be a revelation to all of us. All
[57:08] the ones that come once in a while when
[57:10] they feel like it. I only to me I think
[57:13] people think they live holy enough that
[57:14] they don't need to come every time
[57:18] because they only come every so often.
[57:23] True. They don't have a revelation how
[57:25] much light they need yet. That's right.
[57:28] Amen. Come on. You know, we there
[57:30] there's things and I don't mean to, you
[57:33] know, if if this job is for the pastor,
[57:35] tell him and let him correct me, but
[57:38] people that they won't miss other
[57:40] things. They won't miss their their job.
[57:44] They won't miss their vacation.
[57:46] They won't miss all the fun stuff that
[57:48] mean the most to them.
[57:51] Right. Right. I don't need to say no
[57:52] more. Okay, you know what I'm talking
[57:55] about. I don't want to get on nobody's
[57:56] toes. Amen. The sun has traveled from
[57:58] the east to the west and we're on the
[57:59] west coast. The light can only do one
[58:01] thing. Go back east on the other
[58:09] side in Isaiah 6. You read the scripture
[58:13] there. When I was studying this, you
[58:16] know, I've read Isaiah 6 many
[58:20] times. And he and he because we know
[58:22] that when the he talks about the the
[58:24] angel that brought the coal off the the
[58:26] fire and touched it to his lips and he
[58:29] he told him he's he said you know who
[58:31] will go for us and he said here who here
[58:33] am I lord send
[58:36] me here am I send me let me take the
[58:39] light to the world let me go save the
[58:41] the your people the nation of Israel let
[58:43] me let me go to them and preach this to
[58:46] them let me let me be the
[58:48] one Isaiah didn't know that He was going
[58:51] to go preach a message to blind their
[58:52] eyes. Oh wow. That's what God was
[58:56] calling him for. Go preach to them and
[58:59] blind them.
[59:03] Also I heard the voice of the Lord
[59:05] saying, "Who am I? Who shall I send and
[59:08] who will go forth?" Then I said, "Here
[59:10] am I. Send
[59:11] me." He said, "Go and tell this people,
[59:14] hear ye indeed, but understand not. See
[59:17] ye indeed but perceive not. Make the
[59:19] heart of this people
[59:21] fat. Make their eyes your ears heavy.
[59:24] Shut their eyes lest they see with their
[59:25] eyes and hear with their ears and
[59:27] understanding with their heart and
[59:29] convert and be healed. We just read that
[59:32] earlier, right? In the New Testament,
[59:35] God's saying it again.
[59:38] I'm going to give you a message. What
[59:40] What if What if the the the the
[59:42] messenger of his age had been come to
[59:44] preach a message to blind our eyes and
[59:46] we would never know this? What if that's
[59:48] what God had sent him to do?
[59:51] You you know when Isaiah did this,
[59:53] brother Brandham said that it didn't
[59:55] matter that
[59:57] that let me find it. No matter how much
[1:00:00] the people wanted to believe, they could
[1:00:02] not
[1:00:03] believe because Isaiah said so.
[1:00:08] No matter how much they wanted to
[1:00:09] believe, I want to see this message. I
[1:00:12] want to live this message. Yeah.
[1:00:15] But it's not in here. That's why you see
[1:00:18] people come in here. They they they come
[1:00:20] up the altar, they get saved. You
[1:00:22] witness to somebody. There's some of
[1:00:23] y'all that have witnessed to people at
[1:00:24] work. You've witnessed to people at work
[1:00:26] and and and they started coming to the
[1:00:28] church and they embraced it and embraced
[1:00:30] it. They love it. They love it. But
[1:00:31] after a
[1:00:32] while, they're gone. They don't come
[1:00:35] back.
[1:00:37] They they they love the idea of living
[1:00:40] this way.
[1:00:42] They they lived it right here.
[1:00:45] I I I can see where the Bible says that
[1:00:47] I want to live this way. I want to I
[1:00:48] want to do that. I knew a woman one time
[1:00:50] that she liked the way the Amish lived.
[1:00:52] So, she started dressing that way. She
[1:00:54] wasn't Amish.
[1:00:56] Start making their clothes that way. Be
[1:00:58] trying to be that
[1:01:01] way. And then after a while, that phase
[1:01:04] faded out.
[1:01:06] Right? So, people they come in and they
[1:01:08] sit on the peel. Some of them might do
[1:01:09] it for years, never embrace it. They
[1:01:12] might even disagree with things that
[1:01:14] being preached up here and never say,
[1:01:15] "You'd never know it." Yeah.
[1:01:19] But their ears are heavy. And God has
[1:01:21] shut their eyes and they can't see.
[1:01:25] But they're living it with a idea. This
[1:01:27] is a good thing to live, but they'll
[1:01:29] never see the light. Right?
[1:01:34] Brother Brandham said in s we would see
[1:01:36] Jesus remember the very thing that
[1:01:38] destroyed the
[1:01:39] world saved Noah.
[1:01:44] The very thing that destroyed the world
[1:01:48] saved Noah.
[1:01:50] The very thing that's going to destroy
[1:01:51] this word this world spoken word of God
[1:01:55] is going to save you.
[1:01:57] Amen. Brother says in God of this evil
[1:02:00] age, God is calling a people for his
[1:02:03] name's sake by grace and is called an
[1:02:07] evil age. But we'll prove by the Bible
[1:02:09] that this is the age that he was
[1:02:11] speaking
[1:02:12] of. Very strange thing to think that
[1:02:15] that in an evil age like this that God
[1:02:18] would be calling his bride.
[1:02:22] Let's go all the way back to Genesis 1.
[1:02:25] How many has ever seen your salvation
[1:02:29] and your
[1:02:31] redemption in Genesis
[1:02:34] 1? I had
[1:02:37] neither. In the beginning, God created
[1:02:39] the heaven and the earth, and the earth
[1:02:41] was without form and void. And darkness
[1:02:44] was upon the face of the earth, and the
[1:02:46] spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[1:02:48] waters. And God said, "Let there be
[1:02:50] light." And there was light. And God saw
[1:02:52] the light. and that was and that it was
[1:02:54] good and God divided the light from the
[1:02:58] darkness. You look at verse two, the
[1:03:00] earth was out was without form and
[1:03:06] void. Form means formless, emptiness,
[1:03:08] confusion, chaos, nothingness, a
[1:03:11] desolation, a worthless thing,
[1:03:14] worthless.
[1:03:16] That's what you were. You were without
[1:03:19] form. This earth right here was without
[1:03:23] form
[1:03:25] and void. Yeah. Emptiness,
[1:03:30] waste, an undistinguishable ruin.
[1:03:34] That's you.
[1:03:36] That is you. That's the way you were
[1:03:39] before this light shined upon you. Amen.
[1:03:44] And the spirit of God moved up on the
[1:03:45] face of the wa face of the waters and
[1:03:48] God said, "Let there be
[1:03:50] light." You wouldn't be here today if
[1:03:53] God hadn't said, "Let there be light in
[1:03:55] your life."
[1:03:57] You would still be without form and
[1:04:00] void. You would be an undistinguishable
[1:04:02] ruin. You would be a wasteland,
[1:04:06] a place of chaos. When God looked upon
[1:04:09] on on the earth and he when he made that
[1:04:11] and he said let there be light he said
[1:04:13] it was
[1:04:14] good. How many knows brother Brandham
[1:04:16] said that he formed the
[1:04:19] the it didn't happen right away when he
[1:04:22] said let there be light. There wasn't
[1:04:24] instant light.
[1:04:27] There wasn't instant light. How many
[1:04:29] knows the sun wasn't made yet when he
[1:04:31] said let there be light?
[1:04:35] True. That was that was you in God moved
[1:04:39] upon the face of the waters. He said,
[1:04:41] "Let there be light." And there was
[1:04:42] light. This was your life
[1:04:45] spiritually. When he spoke a creation
[1:04:48] and you had to happen when you took your
[1:04:51] first breath, if you were a seed of God,
[1:04:53] he had to place that seed in there in
[1:04:56] that piece of dirt. He had to place a
[1:04:58] seed. And when he said, "Let there be
[1:05:00] light." Light might not come for 20
[1:05:02] years to that seed. That's right.
[1:05:06] But there's going to be light. If God
[1:05:07] spoke, there'll be light in your life,
[1:05:09] there will be light.
[1:05:12] And he just as he breathed over the the
[1:05:15] earth, brother Bam said, how he breathed
[1:05:16] upon the earth. When he formed the earth
[1:05:19] and he and he breathed upon it and
[1:05:20] things begin to happen when you were
[1:05:22] born, he had to breathe his breath of
[1:05:24] life into you.
[1:05:28] That's how he placed the seed there. He
[1:05:29] breathed over you. Put that seed in
[1:05:31] there. And now that seed lays dormant,
[1:05:33] waiting for the light. He spoke it. He
[1:05:36] spoke it. Brother Brand said this was
[1:05:38] God's spoken word. Well, God spoke. It's
[1:05:40] impossible not to happen. God said, "Let
[1:05:43] there be light in your life." God said,
[1:05:44] "You let the cancer be healed in your
[1:05:47] life." You say, "You don't see
[1:05:49] nothing." Be delivered. Whatever you
[1:05:52] have need of, you say, "I don't see
[1:05:54] anything happen." It doesn't matter.
[1:05:55] He's already spoke it. Yes.
[1:05:58] Brother Ram said God believed his own
[1:06:00] word. When we read in the Bible,
[1:06:02] believers lay hands on the sick and they
[1:06:04] shall recover,
[1:06:06] right? They shall recover. That's the
[1:06:09] spoken word of God.
[1:06:11] That's God speaking.
[1:06:16] If you have faith the size of a mustard
[1:06:17] seed, the grain of a mustard seed,
[1:06:20] right? Amen.
[1:06:25] that much faith. God's already spoke
[1:06:27] it. It's got to happen. It has to
[1:06:30] happen. It's impossible not to happen.
[1:06:33] Amen. Yeah. Amen.
[1:06:37] Abraham said, "And who is God?" When God
[1:06:38] spoke, let there be light, said there
[1:06:40] was nothing. And when something
[1:06:41] happened, Adam and Adam turned there and
[1:06:43] began to whirl around and the sun became
[1:06:47] becoming into existence because God said
[1:06:48] there be.
[1:06:56] Genesis 1 11 through 12. And I know I'm
[1:07:00] I'm reading a lot. So, okay.
[1:07:02] But God said, "Let the earth bring forth
[1:07:04] grass and the
[1:07:07] herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree
[1:07:10] yielding fruit after his kind, whose
[1:07:11] seed is in itself upon the earth." And
[1:07:13] it was so. And the earth brought forth
[1:07:15] grass and herb yielding after its kind.
[1:07:17] the tree yielding forth whose seed was
[1:07:19] in itself after his
[1:07:21] kind. And God saw that it was
[1:07:24] good. And then we're going to skip down
[1:07:26] to 14 and 15. And God said, "Let there
[1:07:30] be firmates, firmament of the heaven
[1:07:32] divide the day from the night, and let
[1:07:34] there be signs and for seasons, for days
[1:07:36] and years, and let them be for lights in
[1:07:38] the firmament of the heaven to give
[1:07:39] light upon the earth." And so Jesus, God
[1:07:42] says in the beginning of Genesis 1, he
[1:07:44] says, "Let there be light." It's not
[1:07:45] till the fourth day where he creates the
[1:07:48] sun and the moon and the stars. So what
[1:07:51] was that light? Yeah. Come on. Look.
[1:07:54] What was the firminant? We we've heard
[1:07:56] what the firmament was when he divided
[1:07:57] the firminant and then he pushed it back
[1:07:59] and said on this this is going to be
[1:08:00] called a day. This the push back the
[1:08:03] firminant the things in your life. This
[1:08:05] super expanse of the heavens is what it
[1:08:07] was. An expanse. That's the definition
[1:08:10] in the in the Hebrew. But in the an
[1:08:12] expanse in the heavens. So God said,
[1:08:15] "We're going to move that away and a
[1:08:16] certain time we're going to let the sun
[1:08:18] shine and then another time we're going
[1:08:20] to let the moon shine." Yes. Amen.
[1:08:23] This is light.
[1:08:26] Yeah.
[1:08:28] And the earth brought forth grass herb
[1:08:30] yielding seed after he kind. How did it
[1:08:33] do that? There had to be a light to
[1:08:35] shine upon it. This there had to be
[1:08:37] light to and whose seed in itself after
[1:08:40] its kind. And God saw that this was
[1:08:42] good.
[1:08:44] That same light has shown in this day,
[1:08:46] the sen light
[1:08:49] shined upon your lives. Amen.
[1:08:53] If you look at the age that we're
[1:08:55] speaking, talking about this age, I
[1:08:57] can't speak on Paul's age and Martin
[1:09:00] Luther's, but this age, the darkest age
[1:09:03] ever been. Amen. You know, I was marvel
[1:09:06] at that that that brother Brandham
[1:09:08] talked about Paul and Peter and all
[1:09:09] them. They they wanted to live in this
[1:09:11] age.
[1:09:13] They wanted to live in the light of this
[1:09:16] age, the most evil age. But this is when
[1:09:21] this is when the the the light that you
[1:09:23] love so much pulls you out here. When
[1:09:24] you get mature and it finally pulls you
[1:09:27] all the way out
[1:09:30] to me. That's grace. That's God's grace.
[1:09:33] Amen.
[1:09:35] In Revelations 3:14-18, "And unto the
[1:09:38] angel of the church of latest sea is
[1:09:39] right, these things saith, amen, the
[1:09:42] faithful and true witness, the beginning
[1:09:44] of the creation of God. I know thy
[1:09:46] works. Thou art neither cold nor hot, I
[1:09:49] would thou were cold or hot." So because
[1:09:52] thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor
[1:09:53] hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth.
[1:09:57] Because thou sayest, I am rich and
[1:09:58] increase with goods, and have need of
[1:10:00] nothing, and knowest not that thou art
[1:10:02] wretched, miserable, and poor, and blind
[1:10:05] and naked. Amen. I counsel thee to to
[1:10:08] buy of me gold tried in the fire, that
[1:10:10] thou mayest be rich, and white
[1:10:12] raignment, that thou mayest be clothed,
[1:10:14] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[1:10:16] appear, and anoint thy eyes with Isa,
[1:10:18] that they may see. People thinking that
[1:10:21] they have an intellectual understanding
[1:10:23] of this word, they'll get by with it.
[1:10:25] They understand it. They can now quote
[1:10:28] most of us probably. Yeah. To me, they
[1:10:31] explain it away. That's right. They take
[1:10:33] the word and they they they read it and
[1:10:35] they see it and they try to get an
[1:10:37] understanding up here and then they
[1:10:38] explain everything you believe. They
[1:10:40] explain it away. They explain the lie
[1:10:42] away. Yeah. They know more than the
[1:10:45] pastor. They know more than the prophet.
[1:10:50] They're blind.
[1:10:52] This is when God says, "You're
[1:10:53] lukewarm." They're trying. They have a
[1:10:55] form of religion. They're trying to live
[1:10:57] right the best they know how. But God
[1:10:59] says, "You're lukewarm. I'll spit you
[1:11:01] out of my
[1:11:05] mouth." You run into people all the
[1:11:08] time. I run into people sometimes that
[1:11:10] they they want to when you're around
[1:11:11] them, they they want to quote scriptures
[1:11:13] and tell you, "Hey, you know, look at
[1:11:15] this type here. Look at this and look at
[1:11:16] this." And then when you see them live
[1:11:18] their life, you're thinking,
[1:11:21] "You're the same guy that was quoting
[1:11:22] scriptures to me.
[1:11:24] You're the one that's claiming to me you
[1:11:26] have light. Here you are living like
[1:11:27] that do and doing the things that you're
[1:11:29] doing. Don't give me the light from your
[1:11:31] mouth. Give me the light from your life.
[1:11:33] Amen. That's what I want to see shine
[1:11:35] out of you out of your life. I don't
[1:11:36] want to hear light come from your mouth.
[1:11:39] Amen. That's good. Written epistles read
[1:11:41] of all men.
[1:11:43] You know, when I when I was young, I
[1:11:44] used to think that that go into the
[1:11:47] world preach the gospel to every
[1:11:48] creature. But I have to witness to
[1:11:50] everybody. I mean, when I was in school,
[1:11:52] when I was in elementary and middle
[1:11:54] school, I thought, I'm going to go to
[1:11:57] hell because I'm not witnessing to
[1:11:59] people. Yeah.
[1:12:02] I'm I was looking at the letter of the
[1:12:05] word, the law and and not understanding
[1:12:08] the light. Oh my. Yes, sir.
[1:12:12] And then when it said further, it says,
[1:12:14] "Your written epistles read of all men."
[1:12:16] That is your life. That's the light.
[1:12:18] When God placed that light in here and
[1:12:20] that light shines forth, it ain't you,
[1:12:22] it's him. It's Zoe. Zoe life. Yeah. It's
[1:12:24] God shining. You got nothing to give.
[1:12:27] You You've got nothing that I want to
[1:12:28] see. Show me Christ in your life. Show
[1:12:32] me the light. The written epistle read
[1:12:34] of all men is the light of God. Amen.
[1:12:37] You don't have to open your mouth. God
[1:12:39] will give you the opportunity. And he
[1:12:40] said, "At that time, I'll give you the
[1:12:41] things to say." Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:12:45] Speaking life. And Jesus tells him,
[1:12:48] "You're blind and naked and you don't
[1:12:50] even know it." What blinded
[1:12:53] him? This light.
[1:12:57] This light right here. He blinded him.
[1:13:00] You know, God God is a is a a gracious
[1:13:04] God. Amen. God is a a kind God. And
[1:13:08] there's But there's things about God
[1:13:09] that we don't understand. We We've
[1:13:12] probably got friends and loved ones.
[1:13:13] We've prayed for years to God bring them
[1:13:14] in. Maybe God is saying they're not part
[1:13:17] of the bride. Amen. We We don't know
[1:13:20] that. We can't judge that. Only God
[1:13:21] knows who's bride and who ain't. But
[1:13:23] sometimes we wonder when then when you
[1:13:26] read the scriptures and you hear what
[1:13:27] brother Brandham saying that the
[1:13:28] preaching of the word blinds them so
[1:13:32] they will not be saved. So they will not
[1:13:34] be converted. So they will not be
[1:13:36] healed.
[1:13:38] What a
[1:13:39] light. What a light. This is the same
[1:13:41] light that blinded Paul. Yeah. that
[1:13:44] blinded Paul. Paul needed a conversion.
[1:13:48] You think God showed him right away when
[1:13:50] he blinded
[1:13:51] him who he really was? Not at all. All
[1:13:55] he said, "Go to Damascus. I'll send
[1:13:57] somebody to you."
[1:13:59] He knew who he was. But then true light
[1:14:01] came into back into his life. Yes, sir.
[1:14:03] It came back into his life. Now, you
[1:14:06] can't you can't sit here and say that
[1:14:07] somebody comes in, sits down, and and
[1:14:09] and it's not made known to them that
[1:14:10] they're not bride. You don't know that.
[1:14:12] It's just not their time yet, right?
[1:14:14] Keep praying for them. Keep lifting them
[1:14:16] up. We We don't give up on people that
[1:14:19] come in here and say, "Well, you know
[1:14:20] what? This is not for me." And they
[1:14:21] leave. We don't give up on people like
[1:14:22] that. You continue to pray for them.
[1:14:24] Continue to be a written epistle.
[1:14:26] Continue to shine the light in their
[1:14:27] path. Amen. And and and when you your
[1:14:30] life is preaching a word to them, then
[1:14:31] don't go tell them something. Hey, the
[1:14:33] Bible says this, the word says this,
[1:14:35] brother Brandham said this, and all
[1:14:36] this, and then you live something
[1:14:37] different.
[1:14:39] Amen.
[1:14:42] I worked with a guy years
[1:14:44] ago, worked with a
[1:14:47] guy, used to come to
[1:14:51] church and we'd worked together 10 years
[1:14:53] and somebody come up to me and said, "I
[1:14:57] didn't know so and so went to your
[1:15:01] church."
[1:15:02] Really? I don't know how they knew where
[1:15:04] I went to church.
[1:15:07] People know. Yeah. People know where you
[1:15:10] go to church. People know what you
[1:15:13] believe. They know who your pastor is.
[1:15:17] They might even know Louis Blevens. Who
[1:15:21] knows? But they know your life.
[1:15:26] Your life should be shining so
[1:15:28] bright. So bright that people just
[1:15:32] automatically don't want to talk bad in
[1:15:33] front of you. Don't want to say bad
[1:15:35] things. Don't want to do this to offend
[1:15:37] you, that, and all that stuff. Amen.
[1:15:39] That's the light shining out in your
[1:15:40] life. Amen.
[1:15:43] You can't make that up. You can't fake
[1:15:45] that. You can't pretend that.
[1:15:54] Christ the mystery revealed. Brother
[1:15:55] said, Isaiah said in the spirit, "Before
[1:15:57] the God of heaven has blinded your eyes,
[1:15:59] you're doing like Eve did excepting the
[1:16:02] intellectual
[1:16:05] side and know nothing of the spirit of
[1:16:08] God." Therefore, won't they all fall in
[1:16:09] the ditch? Both the leader and the
[1:16:11] blind, too. The leader will fall in the
[1:16:13] ditch because he's blind also. The
[1:16:14] leader fall that's blind leading, they
[1:16:16] both fall in the
[1:16:18] ditch. Your pastor falls, you fall with
[1:16:21] him. Amen. How many How many in the last
[1:16:24] 1015 years have we seen pastors just get
[1:16:26] away from the message and over half the
[1:16:28] congregation follow them?
[1:16:30] Leave them.
[1:16:33] They're blind.
[1:16:36] It's because they was looking at him at
[1:16:37] a man as a man anyway. They weren't
[1:16:40] seeing the light come through him. Yeah.
[1:16:43] And if he falls, they fall. That's
[1:16:46] right.
[1:16:49] If you're following with natural light
[1:16:50] and it goes out, where are you going to
[1:16:52] go?
[1:16:54] If you're following that and it goes
[1:16:57] out, where are you going to go?
[1:17:00] How you going to live? How you going to
[1:17:02] get from point A to point B?
[1:17:06] Go try driving down the road in a new
[1:17:08] moon. Turn your headlights
[1:17:11] off. I saw this video the other day and
[1:17:15] it was funny.
[1:17:17] This woman got in front of this car with
[1:17:20] his headlights on with a on a bicycle.
[1:17:23] She takes riding off that bicycle and
[1:17:24] the guy in the car turns his lights off.
[1:17:27] Turns him back off and she's in a ditch.
[1:17:30] She gets back on it, starts riding, he
[1:17:32] turns them off again, turn them back on,
[1:17:34] she's in this
[1:17:36] ditch. You know, it's funny, but when
[1:17:39] you look at it, that's the way people's
[1:17:41] lives are. Yes, brother. They're
[1:17:42] following a man, a light that a man is
[1:17:44] standing here trying to show them his
[1:17:46] own light. Yeah. And they're going after
[1:17:49] it. But when his light goes out, uhoh,
[1:17:53] what are they going to follow? You
[1:17:55] follow a light today that is eternal,
[1:17:57] will never go out. Amen.
[1:18:01] If the pastor falls, you keep following
[1:18:03] the light.
[1:18:05] If every half the people or all the
[1:18:07] people in the church leave, you keep
[1:18:08] following the light. God will send you
[1:18:11] another one.
[1:18:13] [Music]
[1:18:15] Abraham said convinced and concerned
[1:18:17] that Eve was not thoroughly convinced
[1:18:19] that God's word was true. She wasn't
[1:18:22] thoroughly convinced that what God said
[1:18:23] was true. If she
[1:18:25] had, if she had, she wouldn't have fell.
[1:18:34] We've been blessed to have the true
[1:18:36] light of this gospel shining in our
[1:18:37] lives so long that we forget darkness is
[1:18:40] present.
[1:18:43] Bask in that light to where you don't
[1:18:46] even see the darkness.
[1:18:48] Darkness is always there. Yeah. You
[1:18:51] remember when God said, "Let there be
[1:18:53] light." He didn't say, "Let there be no
[1:18:56] more darkness."
[1:18:58] The word says he just separated them.
[1:19:01] He divided the light and the darkness.
[1:19:04] Did not do away with it. It's still
[1:19:06] there.
[1:19:11] Brother Bram said, "I believe the sun
[1:19:12] and the moon were already in existence.
[1:19:14] There was a fog and a mist over all the
[1:19:17] earth, making it dark. God said, "Let
[1:19:19] there be light." And the darkness faded
[1:19:21] away, and there was a cloudless
[1:19:23] sky. That was you. You were in total
[1:19:26] darkness before God said, "Let there be
[1:19:27] light." Amen. You were in total
[1:19:30] darkness. didn't know where to go. There
[1:19:31] was a fog and a mist on your life.
[1:19:35] But the light was always there.
[1:19:39] Even when the fog in the mist was
[1:19:41] present,
[1:19:43] the light was always there.
[1:19:46] This light that you live in and follow
[1:19:48] after now has never not been here.
[1:19:52] It's always been here. It's been waiting
[1:19:55] on you. Oh yeah. It's been you have to
[1:19:58] have a desire for the fog in the mist to
[1:20:00] go away.
[1:20:02] You you can't you know Satan's still job
[1:20:04] is still the same. We we've heard it a
[1:20:06] hundred times. He has a job to do. His
[1:20:09] job is making mist and fog. That's what
[1:20:12] he does. He tries. He knows that sun is
[1:20:15] there. He knows he can't put out the
[1:20:16] light. The sen is right there and
[1:20:19] there's nothing he can do about it. He
[1:20:20] knows he can't. But what he can do is he
[1:20:22] can make your life full of confusion. He
[1:20:25] can make your your life turn it upside
[1:20:27] down, putting circumstances and symptoms
[1:20:29] in your life that you don't understand.
[1:20:32] Sometimes we get so focused on the
[1:20:33] things in in our life that we we forget
[1:20:36] that there's a light shining.
[1:20:38] We forget that it's
[1:20:40] there. And sometimes all we can remember
[1:20:43] is
[1:20:44] darkness. There's some people, true sons
[1:20:47] and daughters of God, they go through
[1:20:48] things. cuz I know I've said it before,
[1:20:50] you get people that are grieving so bad
[1:20:52] over something. It's hard to have faith.
[1:20:55] It's hard to to trust God and believe
[1:20:57] that when you've lost a loved one,
[1:20:58] someone that's close to you or or this
[1:21:00] and you're going through all this and
[1:21:01] it's hard to have faith. It's hard to
[1:21:03] push back the fog. It's hard to push
[1:21:05] back the mist in the darkness. Yeah.
[1:21:09] But it's always there. It's always been
[1:21:11] there.
[1:21:15] There's some of you, there was parts of
[1:21:17] those fog and mist that you enjoyed.
[1:21:21] You enjoyed
[1:21:23] it. You had fun getting drunk and
[1:21:26] partying, doing that thing. You thought
[1:21:28] you
[1:21:30] did. If you're predestinated seat of
[1:21:32] God, when you was at your lowest low in
[1:21:34] the darkest of darks that you ever been,
[1:21:37] there was still light there. Yeah. Amen.
[1:21:40] When you thought you were having the
[1:21:41] best time of pleasure in the world you
[1:21:43] ever had, that light, that light was
[1:21:46] still there waiting for you because God
[1:21:49] never took his breath away when he
[1:21:50] breathed that breath of life into you.
[1:21:53] Place that seed in there. He didn't say,
[1:21:55] "Uh, missed it. I didn't mean to put
[1:21:58] that in." Brother Rob taking that back.
[1:22:01] God don't take back.
[1:22:03] God don't take back. If he ever placed
[1:22:05] that seed in there, he placed that seed
[1:22:08] in there knowing you were going into
[1:22:10] darkness.
[1:22:11] Place it there anyway.
[1:22:14] He knew what was going to be on the
[1:22:16] other side of that. He knew what the
[1:22:18] dark although this longer road of
[1:22:19] darkness might have took you 40 years.
[1:22:22] You might have been in it for 40 years.
[1:22:24] You might have went from one
[1:22:25] denomination to another. You might even
[1:22:27] been
[1:22:28] atheist. But it doesn't matter where you
[1:22:31] went.
[1:22:33] What matters is where you got to.
[1:22:35] [Applause]
[1:22:36] What matters is that seed that was
[1:22:39] placed in there. Light fell upon it and
[1:22:42] then you begin to water it. Amen.
[1:22:47] You can't say that this word is
[1:22:50] true and never water it.
[1:22:53] You can't say I believe this message and
[1:22:56] never water it. I don't need to go. I
[1:22:59] don't need to go cuz I I believe it. I
[1:23:01] believe everything he said. I had a
[1:23:03] buddy of mine tell me that one time we
[1:23:05] were we were playing golf somewhere and
[1:23:08] and
[1:23:09] I my heart was heavy for him and I said,
[1:23:12] "Man, do you you know you ever going to
[1:23:15] come back to church?" He said, "Man, I I
[1:23:18] believe Brother Donny's right. I believe
[1:23:19] Brother Brandham's right."
[1:23:22] How sad. How sad to believe that
[1:23:25] intellectually and not have a light to
[1:23:27] pull you into it. Oh,
[1:23:30] you believe it with your mind. Yeah. But
[1:23:33] you don't have the heart for it. You
[1:23:34] don't your soul don't there's no soul
[1:23:36] for it. What a sad place to be. Talk
[1:23:39] about the grace of God. That could have
[1:23:41] been me.
[1:23:43] He didn't realize what he was saying. He
[1:23:45] was saying, "I'm iniquity."
[1:23:47] To know the truth and not do it. The
[1:23:49] Bible says iniquity. He chose iniquity
[1:23:52] over light.
[1:23:54] Amen.
[1:23:57] Depart from me, you workers of iniquity.
[1:23:58] I never knew you. I put the light right
[1:24:01] in front of you. I put it there. I left
[1:24:03] it there for years and years and years
[1:24:05] in front of it. And you chose to go your
[1:24:06] own way. But I believed, Brother
[1:24:09] Brandon, but God, I believed, Brother
[1:24:11] Donnie. I believe what was being
[1:24:14] preached. What What did this Bible say?
[1:24:17] If you believe me, if you love me. Well,
[1:24:20] brother, sin is unbelief. That's right.
[1:24:23] Amen. Right. You say, "Well, I'm not a
[1:24:24] sinner because I believe
[1:24:29] you have to let it live in you." Yes. It
[1:24:32] has to
[1:24:33] live. You You can't just go dayto day
[1:24:36] saying, "Man, I'm so glad I believe the
[1:24:38] word. I believe that when the Lord
[1:24:40] comes, I'll be ready." You'll be cast
[1:24:42] into outer darkness. Yeah.
[1:24:52] I'm on a hurry. John 1. In the beginning
[1:24:56] was the word. The word was with God and
[1:24:57] the word was God. The same was in the
[1:25:00] beginning with God. All things were made
[1:25:02] by him and without him was not anything
[1:25:04] that was
[1:25:05] made. In him was life and the life was
[1:25:09] the light of men. In God was life. God
[1:25:13] had a life and that life was your light.
[1:25:19] That's what John says. That life was
[1:25:21] your light.
[1:25:23] This is the best
[1:25:24] part. The
[1:25:26] light shineth in darkness. Hallelujah.
[1:25:30] You shine in darkness. Hallelujah. Cuz
[1:25:33] his life was your light. He gave it to
[1:25:35] you. Remember, ye are the light of the
[1:25:37] world, right? Amen. So he give it to you
[1:25:41] and the darkness comprehended it not.
[1:25:45] Amen. How many knows what comprehended
[1:25:48] mean? Oh yeah.
[1:25:51] So I'm going give you a few words here.
[1:25:53] The light shine in darkness and the
[1:25:54] darkness comprehended at night. Not
[1:25:56] shine to appear to become visible to be
[1:26:00] evident.
[1:26:01] Yeah. It's a fact.
[1:26:04] There's no disputing it. Right. If I
[1:26:06] take evidence to court, you can't
[1:26:08] dispute it because it's been entered.
[1:26:10] The judge has entered this exhibit
[1:26:13] A. It's
[1:26:15] evident. It's shining forth. The light
[1:26:19] shineth is evident. The light is evident
[1:26:22] in darkness.
[1:26:24] Darkness is dimness,
[1:26:27] obscurity, literally or fig
[1:26:29] figuratively. Obscurity that blocks the
[1:26:31] light of God when faith is lacking.
[1:26:36] to
[1:26:37] comprehend, to seize, to grasp, to
[1:26:41] overtake.
[1:26:43] So it says the light evidently
[1:26:47] shineth in
[1:26:50] obscurity, darkness,
[1:26:53] dimness, and the darkness could not
[1:26:56] comprehend it. The darkness could not
[1:26:59] overtake it.
[1:27:01] Yeah. The light that you have in your
[1:27:03] life, darkness will never overtake it.
[1:27:05] Amen. Sometimes it feels like it.
[1:27:09] But this is God's word. If you have his
[1:27:12] life, which is your light,
[1:27:15] if you have his light, darkness will
[1:27:18] never overtake it. That's what
[1:27:21] comprehended not means. It will not
[1:27:23] overtake. It will not seize.
[1:27:26] It's still there. It'll always be there.
[1:27:29] There's never going to be a moment until
[1:27:31] you take a rapture that darkness is not
[1:27:34] going to be there.
[1:27:36] From the millisecond that you take a
[1:27:38] rapture, darkness is going to be present
[1:27:43] until you get there. Then there's no
[1:27:45] more night.
[1:27:48] But the darkness in your life, when God
[1:27:50] says, "I when I give you I'll give you
[1:27:52] my life. That is my light." He didn't
[1:27:53] say, "And and plus I'll take away the
[1:27:56] darkness." He didn't say that. He gave
[1:27:58] you light because you're going to be
[1:28:00] walking through darkness.
[1:28:02] You need a light when you walk in
[1:28:03] darkness. The bride is not walking in
[1:28:06] darkness. She's walking through
[1:28:07] darkness.
[1:28:10] You are the only light that some people
[1:28:12] will ever see. Amen. People see your
[1:28:15] life. It's like they're in total
[1:28:16] darkness. You ever go see these tunnels?
[1:28:18] At the very end, you can see the light.
[1:28:20] That's the way your life appears to them
[1:28:22] because they're in total darkness and
[1:28:24] you are the only light in this age that
[1:28:25] they will ever see. Amen. Sometimes
[1:28:28] they're drawn to it, sometimes they're
[1:28:30] not.
[1:28:33] Does that make sense?
[1:28:40] The light shineth in darkness. So, who
[1:28:42] is the light? It's God. I'll be with
[1:28:45] you, even in you to the end of the
[1:28:47] world. Even the times when you can't you
[1:28:50] can't you don't know where to turn.
[1:28:52] Yeah. How many's be in that situation?
[1:28:54] Something come in your life and you
[1:28:56] don't know what to do. You're at your
[1:28:57] lowest point. You don't know what to do.
[1:28:59] And God says, "You still have the light.
[1:29:01] You still have the light. You still have
[1:29:03] my life." That's what the Holy Ghost is.
[1:29:05] For the if you're not confused, Holy
[1:29:07] Ghost is God's life. And that's your
[1:29:09] light. Yes.
[1:29:16] Don't ever think that you have
[1:29:19] just I'm one of the weakest
[1:29:21] Christians. I'm one of the weakest. I'm
[1:29:23] the lowest of the lowest Christians. You
[1:29:25] know, we we take that part when the
[1:29:27] weakest Christian gets on his knees that
[1:29:29] all hell trembles. And that's the truth.
[1:29:31] Yeah. But let let me reassure you of
[1:29:34] something. God don't give you a smaller
[1:29:37] portion of the Holy Ghost than he does
[1:29:38] somebody else.
[1:29:43] The smallest amount of God's
[1:29:46] power, the smallest
[1:29:49] amount
[1:29:51] equals the greatest amount of his power.
[1:29:54] Amen.
[1:29:58] Do you understand that
[1:30:01] the smallest tiniest bit of God's power
[1:30:07] is a strong is the
[1:30:11] greatest amount of his power.
[1:30:15] God don't have no weak light, no medium
[1:30:17] light, no strong
[1:30:19] light. God said, "I'm the light of the
[1:30:22] world." And then he said, "You are the
[1:30:25] light of the world."
[1:30:28] You can't say, "Well, they seem to be
[1:30:30] having a better life than me. They've
[1:30:32] got more converts than I do. They
[1:30:33] witness to more people." That's got
[1:30:36] nothing to do with it. Everything is led
[1:30:38] and orchestrated by God. It's got
[1:30:41] nothing to do with you. It's got nothing
[1:30:43] to do with you. You probably say, "I've
[1:30:45] witnessed to hundreds of people and I've
[1:30:46] never converted one." Keep witnessing.
[1:30:49] Amen. This brother's witnessed to five
[1:30:51] and he's got five in church. Keep
[1:30:54] witnessing.
[1:30:57] I remember brother Donnie preaching that
[1:30:59] years. I remember I was at brother
[1:31:00] Charlie Cox's church living in Kentucky.
[1:31:02] I was about 17, 18 years old. And
[1:31:05] brother Donnie had preached Scott
[1:31:06] Symphony in West Virginia. Brother
[1:31:08] Harry, you probably remember that years
[1:31:09] ago. Brother Charlie had a video of it.
[1:31:11] We watched it for service one night. One
[1:31:14] of the most outstanding sermons to this
[1:31:16] day.
[1:31:17] But that's what God is doing. It's he's
[1:31:20] it's an orchestra. It's a symphony. And
[1:31:22] he's saying, "Your part is this. It's
[1:31:25] the same light. They all got the same
[1:31:28] sheet music." Yeah.
[1:31:31] It's the same sheet music.
[1:31:34] It's not
[1:31:35] different. You got the same light. Your
[1:31:38] part's different. Amen. Don't Don't
[1:31:41] think that because somebody's doing
[1:31:43] something more than you that you don't
[1:31:44] have the light. Amen. If you're looking
[1:31:48] for them to be like them, you're going
[1:31:51] to fail. You're killing your light.
[1:31:54] You're bringing fog and mist and
[1:31:56] darkness around your light when you're
[1:31:57] looking at an individual saying, "I want
[1:31:59] to be like that." Yeah. God said, "You
[1:32:03] be like the
[1:32:04] light. Be like the light. Don't worry
[1:32:06] about what everybody else is doing. If
[1:32:08] somebody's bringing people in, pray for
[1:32:10] them. They'll bring more."
[1:32:13] Amen. Amen.
[1:32:16] That's when you you look at people
[1:32:18] sometimes it just astounds me some
[1:32:19] people they they try to find the very
[1:32:21] edge of the light very edge of the
[1:32:24] darkness.
[1:32:25] Oh, brother Brandon didn't say nothing
[1:32:26] about this and he didn't say nothing
[1:32:28] about this. So So I can do Why would you
[1:32:31] get so close to the darkness?
[1:32:34] Why would you get as deep into that
[1:32:35] light as you could get that you're
[1:32:37] consumed by it?
[1:32:39] Go the totally opposite way. Amen.
[1:32:44] If you think, well, wearing a wearing a
[1:32:46] skirt just right to the top of my knees
[1:32:47] is nothing wrong. Why don't you go the
[1:32:49] other way? Wear them to your ankles.
[1:32:52] Go the opposite way.
[1:33:00] Then spake Jesus again unto them,
[1:33:02] saying, I am the light of the world. He
[1:33:05] that followeth me shall not walk in
[1:33:06] darkness, but shall have the light of
[1:33:09] life.
[1:33:12] Let's stand
[1:33:14] together. Matthew
[1:33:16] 5 14-16. You ye are the light of the
[1:33:19] world. A city that is set upon a hill
[1:33:22] cannot be
[1:33:23] hid. I was thinking that when he Jesus
[1:33:26] told him, a city, you're the light of
[1:33:28] the world. A city that sits upon a hill
[1:33:30] cannot be hid. He said, you're like a
[1:33:31] city. We look over into John. When John
[1:33:34] when when the angel said to John, you
[1:33:36] want to see the lamb's w the bride, the
[1:33:37] lamb's wife, what did he show her? Show
[1:33:39] him, showed him the city,
[1:33:42] right? You are the city of God. You are
[1:33:45] the city that sits on a hill that's the
[1:33:47] light to the
[1:33:57] world. unto all that are in the
[1:34:01] house. Let your light so shine before
[1:34:04] men that they may see your good works
[1:34:07] and glorify your father which is in
[1:34:10] heaven. That's who we're bringing glory
[1:34:12] to. You're bringing glory to God. You're
[1:34:16] it's nothing to do to yourself.
[1:34:19] If you got somebody that wants to tell
[1:34:20] you so much of what they've done, who
[1:34:22] they've prayed for, how many messages
[1:34:23] they've preached, how many people
[1:34:24] they've led to Christ and all this, you
[1:34:26] better get away from them.
[1:34:29] cuz they want you to focus on them. Yes.
[1:34:31] Amen.
[1:34:34] His mercy is new every day. Amen. His
[1:34:38] grace is new. Every day should come with
[1:34:40] your light shining brighter than the day
[1:34:42] before. Hallelujah.
[1:34:50] So look at what God chose to put his
[1:34:52] light in.
[1:34:56] There's there's many of you here, me
[1:34:57] included. I could look at my
[1:35:01] life, the things that I've done, places
[1:35:04] I've been, things I've said that I would
[1:35:06] say I would be the last one, Brother
[1:35:07] Harry, that God would put a light
[1:35:09] in. He could have chose cherubams. He
[1:35:12] could have chose angels, seraphims, and
[1:35:13] put the light in. What did he choose?
[1:35:16] What did he choose? He chose dirt.
[1:35:19] He chose dirt to put his light in.
[1:35:23] and says, "Bring forth the seed."
[1:35:28] We look at her some times
[1:35:31] and he needed something to put that
[1:35:33] light in that had been at the lowest of
[1:35:35] lows, something that had been the
[1:35:36] chiefest of sinners. You had to know
[1:35:40] darkness. God said, "I'll put it in
[1:35:42] something that has known darkness has
[1:35:45] been
[1:35:46] there." Right?
[1:35:49] That's why you you don't you don't come
[1:35:51] out of the womb quoting scriptures
[1:35:54] living this life. Every man has to have
[1:35:57] a rebirth. Yeah. A new birth.
[1:36:03] And you were his choice to put the light
[1:36:05] in.
[1:36:07] God is still separating light from
[1:36:09] darkness. Amen.
[1:36:14] I'll read this and then we'll we'll get
[1:36:16] out of here. Shalom. God in the
[1:36:18] beginning separated the light from the
[1:36:19] darkness. And that again that's again
[1:36:21] what God is doing. God separates light
[1:36:23] from darkness. In the beginning he said
[1:36:25] let there be light. Now remember there
[1:36:28] can be no light outside the word of God.
[1:36:30] The very sun out there is the word of
[1:36:32] God vindicated. There was gross darkness
[1:36:35] upon the earth. Fog and mist upon the
[1:36:37] earth and God said let there be light.
[1:36:39] Now what if no light came? Then it
[1:36:41] wouldn't be him do it would do him no
[1:36:42] good to speak. But when he said, "Let
[1:36:44] there be light." And light come into
[1:36:46] existence vindicating that his word was
[1:36:48] right. That life, that light we live by
[1:36:52] today, can you say, "Amen." Amen.
[1:36:56] I've got too much left. Let's Let's bow
[1:36:58] our heads.
[1:37:01] You say you you have a need. You say,
[1:37:04] "Brother Joe, I want to be more like
[1:37:05] that light." I know I do. I want to I
[1:37:08] want to shine to the world brighter than
[1:37:10] I've ever shined in my life.
[1:37:12] you. Your light shining might be the
[1:37:15] light that brings the last one
[1:37:19] in. Let's
[1:37:21] pray. Heavenly
[1:37:23] Father, Lord, we're so grateful, Father,
[1:37:25] that you've shined upon us in this last
[1:37:27] day. Lord, we're so grateful for this
[1:37:30] word that you've vindicated it time and
[1:37:31] time again, Lord. Lord, we're living
[1:37:34] lives when you told us we're written
[1:37:35] epistles read of all men. And sometimes,
[1:37:37] Lord, we wonder in what way are we
[1:37:39] written? Sometimes we we probably feel
[1:37:41] like we're not making a difference.
[1:37:43] Sometimes we feel like, you know, that
[1:37:44] there's we're not we're not doing
[1:37:46] anything for the kingdom of God, but
[1:37:48] Lord, everything is orchestrated in your
[1:37:50] time. Help us to keep feeding, keep
[1:37:53] watering, Lord Jesus, and getting under
[1:37:55] the light, Lord, and let your light
[1:37:57] shine forth from us, Lord. The needs
[1:38:00] here, Lord. There's many here, Father,
[1:38:01] that that want that light to shine
[1:38:03] brighter in their life. Lord, we can all
[1:38:05] be found lacking, Lord. We'll never be
[1:38:07] totally perfect until we take a rapture,
[1:38:10] Father. So I pray, Lord, that you would
[1:38:12] help us to shine brighter than before,
[1:38:14] Lord. So bright, Father, that that the
[1:38:16] world looks upon us, Father, and has to
[1:38:19] wander, has to come peer into this light
[1:38:22] and see what it is. Father, I pray that
[1:38:24] you would touch everyone here, every
[1:38:26] need. We thank you for it, Lord, in
[1:38:29] Jesus name. Amen.
[1:38:32] Larry, can we sing that song? Uh, Way

[1:44:05] [Music]
[1:44:06] are. We have a prayer request here for
[1:44:09] Sister Marilyn Wiggins. She had a major
[1:44:11] heart attack. She is um they've
[1:44:13] intubated her and and they said the next
[1:44:15] 24 to 48 hours are critical. So let's
[1:44:18] just take our sister before the Lord. If
[1:44:20] we'll all pray. Heavenly Father, you see
[1:44:23] the crucial situation with Sister
[1:44:25] Marilyn. Father, Lord, you're more than
