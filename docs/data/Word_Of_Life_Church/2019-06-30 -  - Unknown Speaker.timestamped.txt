[0:00] you see doubt loves doubt depression
[0:05] loves depression spirits love other
[0:09] like-minded spirits
[0:11] that's why let me say this to the young
[0:13] people and to the old be careful who you
[0:16] call friend be careful who you associate
[0:22] with
[0:23] because weakness breeds weakness and you
[0:30] take one spirit that you're affected
[0:32] with it never ceases to amaze me you
[0:35] watch one person with one spirit and
[0:37] they'll friend up with another person
[0:39] they've never met before and they really
[0:41] have nothing in common except that one
[0:43] spirit is so familiar with the other
[0:46] that they almost tag-team with each
[0:48] other you take suicide or depression you
[0:51] take drugs you take lust and those
[0:54] spirits are tractus is brother random
[0:56] here this isn't me and he's saying right
[0:59] here in church there's two spirits a
[1:01] critical spirit loves a critical spirit
[1:06] and you take one person with the
[1:09] critical spirit and it'll find that
[1:11] other family in the church is critical
[1:13] and criticizing the pastor and
[1:15] criticizing the song leader and
[1:16] criticizing the music and they'll get
[1:19] together after church and they'll just
[1:21] go up one side and down the other of
[1:23] that pastor in that church and and what
[1:26] they're doing oh you think you can hide
[1:32] but Jesus found you here tonight that
[1:37] spirit loves that critical spirit feeds
[1:40] one with the other and those people
[1:44] don't even realize it I think they're
[1:47] you know they're really exposing sin
[1:49] little do they know they're giving heed
[1:51] to it seducing spirit to tear down the
[1:54] ministry and reputation at the church
[1:59] spirits love spirits brother Alan says
[2:04] these two spirits connected let me say
[2:06] this young people you'll never live
[2:08] higher spiritually than the influences
[2:12] and friends who use subject
[2:13] self - you want to go higher go around
[2:18] higher - kids
[2:19] you want to be more spiritual find a
[2:22] more spiritual friend than you you'll
[2:26] never live higher than the influences
[2:28] you subject yourself to you want more
[2:34] victory don't go around people without
[2:36] victory you want to get rid of that
[2:39] weakness don't befriend that person with
[2:41] that same weakness find others who have
[2:43] strength and say God give me energy
[2:47] give me strength for my brother and my
[2:49] sister we should be there should be a
[2:52] spirit within us to encourage those that
[2:54] are around us not to discourage anybody
[2:57] but to be an encouragement to your
[2:59] brother and encouragement to your sister
[3:02] be an encouragement to the pastor not a
[3:04] discouragement well it's the truth
[3:10] anyway
