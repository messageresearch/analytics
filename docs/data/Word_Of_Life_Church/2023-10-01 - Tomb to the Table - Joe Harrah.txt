[Applause] this morning oh there he is sneak up on me like that this man right here I told him I said read this is read ball the Lord run you down to tell you he loves you ain't God good he's going to share a testimony with you this morning I want you to listen to this that's truly is a testimony brother Caleb's singing that song I mean searched all over and it's the truth you know at least in my life anyway that I've searched high and low couldn't find nobody that was greater than him all the voids and everything that he is filled I thought I had to fill with lots of other things lots of you know nonsense and everything but truly is nobody greater than him he'll take all that away from you and all it is is him just one thing you know but uh you know if you have a testimony you know I believe that you should share it I ran a long time from not doing that you know because God's pulled on my heart many times uh bringing me back in church sitting here and honestly seeing all you wonderful people a brother said I think last Sunday or a couple Sundays ago said you come to church and you see all y'all smiling faces just like Brother Louie coming in and this these these uh Brothers playing the drums and and the instruments here that they they come and devote their time in and out all the time and it's just you know it's something about the people of God and how it's just a joy that you know you come in you sit with them and it's they bring you love you know but uh you know I shared my testimony with uh brother brother Ron's church and I told about you know how he met me at the waffle house and everything I'm sure some of y'all have heard it but I was talking to brother Joel Brown a while back and he said you know don't be scared to share some of the things that you know that maybe would would some say would it be explicit or what but you know I was hardened drugs and alcohol women you know just anything that is sinful off would bring you and uh you know like searched all over but a lot I gotta figure out where I gotta start here because there's so much I could say but you know I tried quitting those things my little brother had actually he was living with me for a while and he uh got a call from my dad saying that you know if he straightened up he can move back and work for him so he quit doing some things you know because he had be able to work for my dad you know he wanted to make sure that he was on the right path so drug testing him and all that stuff well I I believe God done this for me because if I couldn't have seen it this way I don't think there was another way I could see it but you know I tried quitting doing all those things maybe a month before I got saved and uh I tried doing all that stuff on my own and you know it was hard but I was like you know you got this man ain't no problem ain't nothing else that you can't do you know and uh found out myself found myself even deeper in it two three weeks later you know and realized like man you know you really can't it's not at the time I didn't see that they had such a hold on me you know but I just really I look back now and I realized you know of God's grace and how he did pull me through all that stuff but you know just that kind of those kind of things that you're going through like you know you're being held by something you don't know what it is but it's just because the devil knows that something else was fixing to happen you know and uh anyway I'll share with you a little bit about the Waffle House experience too that I was uh I had a day in the gym on Friday and I just I couldn't sleep pretty much the whole week and I thought it was because because we were fixing to do this competition and I thought it was because of something I was going to do in the gym you know some some big lift but uh I went going going to the gym and then after I got done at the gym I was like man something you know something still like there's just something in my heart that's just burning and you know like I told brother Donnie you know that God had never stopped dealing with me because he had one of my buddies told me not too long ago that he's he's a gentleman he just he knocks on the door while the devil slips through the back door and he just stayed there just knocking just over and over in my life just months and months and months that I've seen and I just kind of pushed him away pushed him away and uh finally that Friday after I got done lifting I was gonna go go eat with one of my friends and I was like you know I'm going to go to Waffle House instead because he didn't answer and I walked in sat down a brother walks in behind me sits down a couple a couple places away from me and he tries to knock on my knock on the door of my heart you know just talking to me you know real nothing nothing like as far as like he just he wanted he wanted to talk to me you know you could tell that he wanted to talk to me and I could tell that he did too so I would just pushed him away as I pushed so many people away and because I know the love that he had for me and how he could he had compassion in his eyes and the love that he's seen and I was just you know what this wasn't happening again today but for some reason you know he'd never he didn't stop which I believe was was God just helping him telling him my friend you know this is somebody that I need I need back so he just kept pursuing me just even sit in that Waffle House through that man and he said pretty much said brother this is your pretty much the last chance that you're going to have today if you don't do something about this you know you're you're going to be in a world of hurt he said you're going to have a change today and it's going to happen today and I just tears just rolling out of my eyes and I look at him and he don't say much more but he says you know the good Lord sent me here today just for your last chance and I look at him just tears rolling my eyes and he says he says a couple more things but he's about to leave and I asked him in his name and he says you'll remember me by Rich in Christ and I turned around as he's walking I'm like I said tears just pouring on my eyes and he's walking away and he says I'll see you up there I'll never forget that man it's just something that he he just had never stopped pursuing me and that's the same thing with any Young Folks any old people that's sitting here you know he you know that he's there and he is still pursuing you you got to let you got to let go of that you've gotta you've got to take hold of what he has given you because I tell you it's one million times better than what you what you would ever experience you know once he gets a hold of you and I just want to praise God for that because I mean it's he's seen me through it has nothing to do with me but he's the one that has shown his mercy and his grace and it's abundant and he's there for you all you got to do is let go for him but anyway I appreciate everybody here in this church I'm not very good at talking but you know just I want to let my testimony be known and maybe one day I'll write it down before you can surprise me again but anyway God bless you all thank you thank you Glory cries won Satan zero thank the Lord Hallelujah and we're forward brother Reid ball this morning this assembly we're for him we're praying for him and we love him and not only him but anybody else if you're running remember this you can run but you can't hide if you belong to him he'll run you down and he'll bring you in well God is good you know God is good yeah just once in a while [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] amen it's good to see y'all this morning thankful for the opportunity I'm honored that brother Donnie would have confidence for me to come here before you and speak before you if I don't know brother Kenny was here with a I'd have handed a baton off but I I appreciate it and brother Reid is his testimony just proves you can't go too far no matter where you're at you have value you have value right that value is that seed of life it doesn't matter where you go what you've done if that seed of life isn't there you have hope I said whether we're singing My Hope Is in him the only hope that you have brother I love the way brother Brandon said hopeless Faith's little sister that means they're related they're related faith and hope are related and if you have hope hope can bring you to Faith amen so if you'll turn your Bibles I can get into it I was telling brother Jimmy Woodson back there I've been taking notes and studying on this for months I studied seven hours yesterday when I closed the computer the devil started talking to me now if you're a minister of Kenny you know what happens every time the devil is going to talk to you it's not going to be received well you're going to say the wrong things and you're not you know you realize when devil starts talking to you it's like a pep talk to a fighter before he gets in the ring he's just giving you ammunition he's just getting you ready to fight so he's a dumb Devil by the field dumb devil so hopefully we can get out of the way it's not us that fights anyway so if you have your Bible turn to John 11 and 21 . I'm going to skip around I'll read a large portion of that that scripture but I will skip around so you're not standing too long a very familiar scripture then Martha said to Jesus Lord if thou has been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it to thee Jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha said unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day and Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he was dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this we'll skip down to verse 37 and some of them said could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind which caused that even this man should not have died and the thing about that scripture that stands out the most to me we look at at people around in our own Sanctuary our own our own church here that are going through some stuff and they're they're at the some of them at the point of death it looks like and Satan tells us could God not have healed them he was amongst you testified that he was amongst you could he not have healed you when you was alive right but our God it's never too late he's always right on time you think Jesus didn't know that Lazarus was going to die he knew he was going to die could not could not this man have opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this men man should not have died Jesus therefore groaning in himself cometh to the Grave it was a cave and a stone laid upon it and Jesus said it take ye away the stone Mary Martha the sister of him that was dead said Lord by this time he stinketh for you have been dead four days I want you to the one thing we're going to talk about today Jesus told them to throw the stone away told them Jesus did not roll the stone away Lord by this time he's tinketh for he has been dead four days Jesus said to her said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou should see the glory of God when they took the stone away from the place where the dead was laid Jesus lift up his eyes and said father I thank you that thou Hast heard me and I know thou heareth me always but because the people which stand by I said it that they may believe that thou has sent me and when he had thus spoke and he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes his face was bound about about with a napkin Jesus said unto them unto them you lose him right you take the grave clothes off of him you you give him praise for all that God has done you remove the filth everything that that he was with inside the grave you take it off we have a job to do then Jesus we're going to go down to John 12 1-2 and then we'll pray then Jesus six days before the Passover came to Bethany where Lazarus which had been dead whom he raised from the dead and there made him a supper and Martha served but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we're so grateful Lord to come to your house this morning Lord to sit around your word father Lord It's food for our journey Lord to tell us of the things of Heaven things Lord that you would desire us to know father there's things that no man can just hail father it takes it takes a revelation from the father Lord we're so thankful for the wonderful spirit we feel here this morning Lord we're so thankful for brother Reid's testimony Lord we believe that you're still in the the saving business we're still believe that you're in the redeeming business you're in the healing business Lord you're in the Deliverance business Lord and and I hope of this sermon this morning Father that we catch a glimpse of that Lord even though we have a part to do it's all you and you receive all the glory we welcome you here this morning Lord I pray that anything that would hinder our thoughts our minds anything that would would hinders from receiving what you have for us Lord I pray that you would remove it Lord help us out to think about what we're going to do after service what we're going to do tomorrow let's think about you right now Lord lay everything aside Lord help us to lay ourselves aside that you could have preeminence in our lives this morning we thank you for in Jesus name amen you can be seated this morning if I'd like to to speak on this I've titled this from the tomb to the table Lazarus went from the tomb to the table Abraham said Serge we would see Jesus now just after many people had come to the feast because Lazarus had been raised from the dead that's why they came to the feast because Lazarus had been raised from the dead and the people come up to see Lazarus they came up to see Lazarus when you got a testimony people won't see you when God's done something in your life people want to hear you they want they want your testimony like brother Reid gave this morning when when God does something for you people want to hear about it in the the script and brother Brandon said people come to see Lazarus said they came to see Jesus too right so there's been a resurrection and followed by the feast and you know we we hear the same thing in the in the uh as we read The Prodigal Son the story of The Prodigal Son when the prodigal son comes home finds himself in a pig pen and he comes home and and the father says my son that was dead is now alive the fathers testifying there has been a resurrection so now let's prepare the feast there has to be a feast following a resurrection there will be a feast following a resurrection [Applause] in Mark 5 38 and he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and see seeth tumult and there that wept and welled greatly and when he come in he said unto them why maketh you this a do and Weep the damsel is not dead but she's sleepeth and they left him to scorn and when he put them all out he taken the father and the mother of the damsel and them that with him entered and where the damsel was laying and he took the damsel by the hand and said unto her to lithakumi which is interpreted damsel I say unto thee arise and straight away the damzilla rose and walked for she was of age of 12 years old and they were astonished with a great astonishment and he charged them straightly that no man should know it and commanded that something be given her to eat for some reason eating follows Resurrection eating follows Resurrection [Applause] and what we want to look at this morning is is not necessarily the resurrection of on the Rapture as much but when we look at the things in our lives you know we we you know I can imagine the the conversation down in Hell whenever Lazarus finally died you know before before he when he was sick and I'm sure Satan heard hey they've sent for Jesus to come if Jesus comes he'll heal him Jesus hadn't raised from any any from the dead yet death was Satan's strongest tool at this time he hadn't used it yet on one of Jesus's friends and Jesus and think and he thought he beat Jesus so I imagine that conversation in hell when something like Satan listen you know I I I've I've brought Lazarus all the way to the end he ain't got much breath left in him but they've sent for Jesus and he's not too far away what am I going to do tell death tell death come here I want to talk to him Satan tells death come here I want to talk to you I I need I need I need you now the healer's coming the Healer they didn't know him they didn't know him as a resurrection in life yet the healer's coming and when the Healer gets here it'll be too late when the Healer comes it'll be too late for him yeah Satan tells you that in your life every day it's too late there's no way out of this so when Jesus got there Mary and Martha said if you'd have been here he wouldn't have died there's many of you who's probably asked that about your loved ones that God took on God if you'd have been here he says I am still when your loved ones pass them comforting words it gives to you I am the resurrection in life doesn't matter what this natural body does but Jesus comes to the to the grave of Lazarus Lazarus was predestinated to be sick and to die he was predestinated to die before his time but he was predestinated to have two resurrections God placed something in in you before the foundation the world it doesn't matter what sickness comes into your life what what anything Satan puts in your life it doesn't matter it does it didn't matter what Satan did to Lazarus you know and what we want to look at this morning and we'll get into different Avenues of it but you know when you got to that point in your life you know Satan when you was in the world Satan didn't seem to bother you as much he didn't bother you as much you probably lived some of your healthiest days out in the world when you come into this message all hell turned against you you've been sick ever since you've been depressed you've had anxiety your kids left your husband left your wife left your family left you it just seems like the worst days of your life and God looks at you and says it's the Glorious Days of your life and Satan he's allowing Satan to put all this thing you know when you you give your heart to the Lord and you you received you come up in the watery grave as a as a a token of of the death burial and the resurrection you come up a new man when you come up a new man Satan's got one job is to put you in the grave and he knows he can't touch that see brother Brandon said he can't touch that seed until God's done with you just like job he can't take your life so there's other tombs and other graves in your life that Satan's going to try to put you in he's going to put you in a tomb of depression he's going to put you in a tomb of cancer a tomb of anxiety a tomb of all kinds of sickness in in things wrong in our lives a tomb of guilt a tomb of Shame a tomb of embarrassment there's so many tombs that Satan is going to do his best to lock you inside and he's going to roll the stone across that's his job would you expect him to do anything else well the brand of sin and condemnation by representation God just think many of these here I trust that every one of them are your children born of a spirit washed in the blood filled with the Holy Ghost ready for the coming and Satan can't get them that way to make them sin he can't get to them to make them doubt your word is wrong they go ahead and follow just to the letter but he tries to come on and flick their body because he knows their body is still sin but their soul is saved their body has got to go back to dust but their soul goes to God Satan can't touch it he knows he can't touch it but he's going to try to afflict that part when he can he's going to make you have bad days he's going to make your days you're going to actually question God God why me why is this stuff come upon me why is this on my family why did I have to lose my mother my father my son Jesus could have stopped the death of Lazarus he could have stopped it but Jesus know who Lazarus had the feast to go to and the only way he can make it to that Feast was through a resurrection all hell might think they have you foreign said this and brother Donnie read this quote I know my redeemer liveth I wrote it down when brother I was studying this at the time and it said and that's it it's in that hour friend it's at that time it's in that crucial crucifying hours that we see the resurrection it's at that time when God loves to display his grace it's that time when God likes to comfort his children sometimes we don't give God the time of day when everything's going good everything's going well in life life around us is is their jobs is good we're making good money our kids are in church everything looks good why is it at those times that we kind of push God off to the side when everything's going well why is it that God has to push us allow Satan in their life to push us to a certain point before we give him Fellowship why is it God has it has to get to the point get us to the point where we cry out to him God sometimes has to let some type of death come in your life and will allow Satan to bury you Lord why am I going through this depression why am I going through anxiety because you wouldn't talk to me when you weren't [Applause] why am I going through these things in my life why why are my my kids not saved because when they were you weren't talking to me you took it for granted there's so many things in our lives that God gives us blessings and when these blessings seem to come Lazarus was his friend Lazarus was a friend of God he was the friend of God but he allowed death to come into his life he let him he let him lay there and stink and rot whose fault just just like the blind man that was born blind Jesus said it's so the glory of God could be revealed it wasn't nobody's fault Lazarus didn't ask for this that's just family didn't ask for this but God wanted to show that he was the resurrection in life and he wants to show that in our life in so many ways in so many ways we won't let him come on why when these things come into our life we you know and I I don't mean to get ahead of myself but so many times we live we live from Camp to camp we live from from prayer line to prayer line we can't wait in four years for the next prayer line just something that you said you got delivered from in the last prayer line that's the only time we cry out to God that's when we're going through the prayer line and we Rejoice for a week or two and then we're right back in the in the mully grubs as they were as they say in two weeks he has a reason God has a reason for everything in your life God has a reason why you're going through the things that you're going through we look at sister Erica God's glory is being revealed whether you see it or not God's glory is being made known whether you see it or not don't look at symptoms don't look at circumstances Jesus told Martha I am the resident he will rise again she didn't get what he was saying she said she thought God Jesus was telling her he'll he'll come forth in the Rapture that ain't what Jesus was saying he'll come forth right now right now because I'm here and if that's Saint Jesus you claim lives in here we we say that quote we sing that song so much he became me that I became him and said he could become me it's the same life in you [Music] if he's the resurrection in the Life are not you the resurrection in life can you not speak to that thing that's inside you holding you down can you not say come forth his Direction Resurrection in life and you say when you receive the holy ghost that his life came in and lives in you his life lives in you you say you testify Jesus lives in here are you portraying what he portrays people look at you in your life and the way you live your life you say Jesus lives in here and then you have a bad day and you fall all to pieces you don't know which way to go which way to turn I've got too many pill bottles to choose from I don't know which one's going to help me [Applause] we try to fix it all first ourselves we try to fix it he's Last Resort in your mind you're on your deathbed and you've pulled a toenail we tried to magnify issues in our life they're so big and to God says there's nothing so if Christ isn't here look at your problem through his eyes look at the issues in your life through God's eyes it's nothing it's nothing looking at sister Erica through God's eyes is nothing absolutely nothing and if there's God that same God Lives in You in his fully manifesting his life in you every problem that can you come across whether it be cancer or whether it be a headache it's nothing it's hard to understand so many times it's hard to understand God's will in us will for in our lives it's hard to understand Lord why am I in this tomb why am I in here why is the stone rolled across the entrance of this tomb you don't have to wait for Jesus to come from four days away [Music] he's right here he's right here you know we want to we want to put a put an Epitaph on everybody's tomb now if Satan could put one on your life what would it say he believed the doctor's report he's going to roll the stone in front of your tomb put a seal on it and across the top she believed what the doctor said he believed ever what everybody was saying about him he failed to see God moving in his life but when we let God work what's the Epitaph say across the top he once was here but now he ain't he came out she once was here but now she's risen God's got epitaphs on empty tombs there's an empty tomb in your life that once was depression I don't know why I'm hitting depression I don't have no idea there's a empty tomb that was guilt there's an empty tomb that was shame an embarrassment and across the top it says she was here but now she ain't you know there's in studying this I got to study you know the the things we look at all this things in our life we want to we want to get down and pray or we want to call so and so and we want to get laid hands on we come up here 14 times in two months at brother Donnie lay hands on us have the brothers lay hands on us and pray and you know and you know I'm stuck in this tune I can't get out I can't get out I can't get out and what did Jesus say to do when you're on driest came to him what did he tell him only believe only believe there's a lot of I don't mean to be rude but when you come up here 14 times in two months for the same problem there's a lot of unbelief going on there's a lot of doubt there's a lot of worry in your life going on God can't work through it only believe it's that simple how do you think Jairus felt when they come to him said don't trouble him no more don't trouble him no more she's already dead don't trouble him Jesus said only believe only believe in what he did when he got there he cast all the doubt out get out he's still casting doubt and worry out he's still casting unbelief they laughed him to scorn when she's she's only asleep why he saw the problem through God's eyes they saw the problem through their eyes brother Branham said and Look Away to Jesus but his only daughter lay at the point of death and he had to go but when he found him he found out that he was the resurrection in life when he said for him a runner come and said don't trouble the master for the girls already dead in his little heart almost failed Satan tells you there's no way out of this grave don't trouble him no more you're here for good only thing that'll fix you maybe some pills go to the doctor because you're in a situation here that you can't get out of that's the same spirit that Satan was using back then he still uses it today unbelief doubt and worry but Jesus said to him said did I not say did you not hear me the first time if you'll only believe you'll see the glory of God Jesus found out he could raise up the driest found out he could raise up the Dead when he looked at Jesus wow Don't Take Your Eyes Off Jesus Don't Take Your Eyes Off him no matter what your problem is no matter what situation how sick you are you may be living you might be on your deathbed right now doctors might give you up it doesn't matter he said only believe keep your eyes on Jesus if thou canists believe if you go search how many times brother Branham says that I only believe and if thou canst believe we need to put that on repeat over and over and over it's that simple we complicated it's like buying something from Ikea and trying to read the the French instructions on it why would you do that when you can come to the front page it's got English we try to complicate things the hungry looked to him and found sustaining food for all life that was natural the hungry spiritual can look to him and find out he's the bread of life the dying Thief look to see what he could see and found in Jesus his pardon Remember Me Lord will now cometh to thy kingdom Jesus said today Thou shalt be with me in Paradise that's what he saw in the hour of his death the sick looked at him and saw the Healer the blind looked and could see depends on what you're looking at now your situation might be all the way up to the the final point and you think it's over Lazarus family probably thought it was over you know brother Jimmy Whitson came back there was talking to me a while ago and he told me he said we was talking about that and he said well Joey so I can imagine there to the fiery furnace when they walked in he said I bet when they were walking in that furnace Shadrach probably looked at Mesa and said meshech it ain't over it ain't over what do you think when Jesus when they killed him on the cross and they laid him in the Tomb I imagine God looked at them angels and said it ain't over it ain't over when you're at your your worst point in your life it ain't over doctors report can say what they want to say we're giving you three months it ain't over right there's still a resurrection and I don't mean a natural Resurrection I'm in a resurrection from that that tomb you're in right now whatever it is it ain't over it ain't over till God says it's over and to a son and daughter of God it's never over you know we we have a part to do as I was saying earlier when Jesus told Mary and Martha you have a part to do he told him to roll the stone away you roll the stone away you want your brother resurrected you have a part to do are we doing our part are we pushing stones are we pushing stones for those in our lives Lazarus wasn't coming out until they've done what Jesus told them Jesus told him you pushed the stone away Humanity has to get involved you want to sit back and you let God do it all you wanted they wanted they could have probably thought maybe Jesus was going to speak and that stone was going to move or maybe Jesus was going to speak and Lazarus was going to walk through the stone Jesus said you do your part you remove the doubt you remove the worry you quit looking at their symptoms you know there's so many times when brother Donnie gets up here and he'll he'll say we'll give you an update on sister Erica you know when he'll say things and I've done determined in my mind I'm not praying for sister Erica again come on come on I'm praising for sister Erica I praise I'm praising for brother Bob Blevins I'm praising for Jerry Phillips I'm praising for those that have needs in their life will you ask God you only have to ask him one time then you start pushing the stone they asked him said Lord I know whatever you say you'll do it he says push the stone away whatever you say and if you say that in your life you said Jesus whatever is in my life whatever's in that my family has need of whatever you ask and Jesus might tell you will push the stone away in other words push the worry away push the doubt away push circumstances away push symptoms away you don't you don't look at that person and think man they look so bad don't look at that person that hasn't been to church in six years and you think they've gone too far push the stone away use faith use faith and push that stone away well Brian said believe it's not this I can see him walking down through that place there to the Grave he said take ye the stone away looked like he'd have been a gentleman he'd have took it away himself but he asked them women to why you got your part to do and they took this Stone the stink was so bad they was about to have suffocate there on account of that a dead human body then I can see him straighten his little self up said father I think thee that thou Hearst me always I've read that scripture in my life probably a hundred and three four hundred times and it just struck me when I was reading it that he didn't say Lord I Thank you that you hears me for his own benefit he said he wanted them to hear him say it he wanted them unbelievers we'll give him security officer duties we said Lord he said I thank thee that thou Harris me but Jesus said that wasn't I wasn't saying that because I know that you know that I'm thankful that's what he said God I know you know that I'm thankful but I wasn't saying it for me I was saying it for them sometimes people need you they need to hear you say how grateful you are to him sometimes they need to hear you praise him because it might lift them up it might give them faith that's why I love here brother Daryl Ward pray I love to hear Brother Daryl pray because it picks me up it lifts me up I know how he feels about to God but when I hear him telling God how he feels it does something for me it gives me Faith it removes all doubt it removes all worry it's something I want no side you're on I want to know what team you're on so sometimes I need to hear you cheering for that team here are so many people sometimes there's people I can tell you right now in church that I've never saw him or heard and say Amen one time and that is sad that's sad look I mean you should do that every morning you get up yeah let alone the church he said father I think thou Hearst me but for those that stand by is why I said that he'd already seen the vision he knew what was going to happen and then he cried with a loud voice and screamed and said Lazarus come forth he said I believe brother if he hadn't called him specifically by name I believe the general Resurrection would have took place that's what I think about him that's right I believe the resurrection of every dead thing that ever died would have come out of the Grave if he just said come forth every living thing that had died not people he didn't say every person he said every living thing why he was the creator brother Branham said when Jesus came down to the grave and he wept the man Jesus wept and God took over the Creator was now speaking the Creator said Lazarus come forth the Creator in your life can say come forth come out of that grave the Creator and you can say roll back to Stone [Applause] I took this note down here when I was studying that brother Brandon is talking about this woman praying for this woman with cancer in that and when he preached go tail he said death lays at the door Faith at the next death lays at one door Faithfully he's at the next God roll away the stone and let Faith take over roll away the Stone May the cancer leave her in Jesus name amen as simple as that death is at this door faith is at this door faith is what Rose the stone away faith is what rode the stone away he didn't say death is at this door life is at this door he said Faith why you have to have faith you have to have Humanity get involved in what God is wanting God has a purpose and it involves you amen it involves every one of us we have a part to do we have to push back to Stone you know I was reading this and I don't know how it came up in my studies but it did I got to think in the Seraph Phoenician woman I was wondering where that persisted if God himself told you it ain't for you Lord I I need this nope getting for you that's what he told her Lord my my daughters got a devil can you come deliver I'm not sent to you I'm sent to the house of Israel and you're not a part of that but what'd she do she pushed harder on the stone she began to push the stone so what did he tell her again she asked him again it's not meat for me to give the dogs of the children's bread because we know the Bible says healing is the children's bread it's not meat for me to give the children's rates of the dogs what she do she pushed some more she never quit pushing God himself said you can't have it and she can't pushing even so the dogs that eat the crumbs give me a crumb Lord a crumb's law all you need for healing is one crumb if you need healing in your life from the bread of life you need one crumb you just push that stone you keep pushing that stone if God says no push the stone [Applause] if God says you can't have it push the stone I promise you when you push that stone there's going to be somebody standing on the other side that says come forth when that stone gets removed somebody's going to be saying come forth faith has removed all doubt that's all that stone is in your life is doubt worry disappointment circumstances symptoms doctors reports bank accounts so they're in the red push the stone right you know sometimes we get to the point where we feel like so much on me there's so much on me I can't I try to pray I can't I can't get through Legion had two thousand demons 2 000 demons that seed well brother Bradham said Satan can never get that seed he'll never get the seed of God ever there might have been two thousand demons on his body in his mind there wasn't a single one touching that seed Jesus heard that seed cry out from across the sea he heard the seed call out for help that seed had enough to push a stone how many members the testimony that Josh Bennett gave here or the quote he was talking about brother random of South Africa about a week before brother Josh Bennett was here I had I was doing some study and that quote came up and I read that quote where brother Brandon was talking about that little boy in Africa that walked around all fours he was born that way they had a chain around his neck he thought he was an animal walk like an animal had a chain around his neck he comes up but Ben said sometime before this little Fella's brother had fell fell off a a goat or a cow or something and hurt his knees and crippled him that little fella mentally challenged didn't have a sane cell in his brain was born that way when he comes up for prayer brother bam said you're not here for you you're thinking of your brother you're thinking of your brother we can have compassion for one another and you get somebody that's totally out of the right mind I have such a love they come before the prophet and they're crying their heart he couldn't even talk brother Brandon read his heart God discerned his heart he wanted his brother healed he come up there to push a stone he come up to remove all doubt in all word he wouldn't hear God healed him brother Branham said after your brother is healed that little fellow stood straight up mother Brown said I helped him up foreign for one another sometimes something that might seem simple to you somebody's problem might be simple to you it might be serious to them I think so often we tend to hold Stones closed we hold Stones closed to people that need Deliverance you might say brother Joe how do you do that you lean on that stone you hold it tight you ain't gonna believe it sister so-and-so did you ain't gonna believe what brother so-and-so did they met a lot laid on their bed at night weeping and crying and forgiveness repent repenting to God for everything they've done for the situation and you're out there dragging it out of hell you're pulling it right out of hell where God put it for them when God forgives something he puts it in hell when you talk about it you took it out now you own it you own it people are needing Deliverance people are trying to to claw out of out of graves of guilt and shame and embarrassment and we're sitting there stomping them back in get back in there you're not going hey let me tell you what brother so-and-so did let me tell you what sister so-and-so did and they're sitting there trying to get life and you're pushing them back in where have we got if we want to take a rapture [Music] if we want to take a Rapture in our life and here we are trying to keep brothers and sisters from taking one [Music] you might not look at it that way but that's exactly what we're doing they want a Rapture they want Deliverance in their life and we're keeping them from it you know as I was talking to somewhere before sometimes we can be so unforgiving so unforgiving we're going to get back to if Christ's life is in you you're going to be like Christ will people Elevate themselves so high above God they're up here they're above God because when they person asks for forgiveness and God says I'm faithful and just to forgive but you can't because you're so higher than God you can't forgive you said what will Joe I have forgiven are forgiven I hope so how come when they show up at the restaurant you're at you can't believe they had the audacity didn't show up it's not forgiveness well Graham said you'd be able to put your arm around and love them I don't care what they did to you right it doesn't matter what they did to you if you can't forgive you ain't going you'll never take a Rapture with unforgiveness what brother brother Don he said here about two or three months ago he said if you got unforgiveness in your heart and the Rapture goes place he said if Jesus was to put you at the Judgment bar you'd send that person to hell because they wronged you here in life unforgiveness is a cancer it destroys relationships it destroys friends and it's not not be that way if Christ's life is in you you will forgive as Christ for your brother Brian said if if you can't forgive God won't forgive you if you can't forgive God will forgive you you know when people they like to they like to tell people's problems under the name of Prayer under the name of Prayer they want to go tell everybody's details on all the juicy things that so and so did brother so and so did sister so-and-so whatever they want to go tell that I was just I was just telling them so so they would know how to pray not only your gossip you're deceitful you're a gossip and you're deceitful what did Jesus say only believe God don't need you to know details for your prayer to work amen he don't need you to know details that's free I'm gonna move on before we get in trouble but Jesus said I don't if you don't forgive every man his trespasses from your heart neither does your heavenly father forgive you brother Brown said that in the church in its condition do we realize the power that lays in US the power that you have when Jesus told me that when they marveled at the works that he done they marveled him when he when he cursed the Fig Tree and then he did the different things they marveled he said Marvel not for Greater Works than this shall you do for I'll be with you even in you I'll go away but I'll come again when I come again I'll be in you and this power it was dropped on 120 in the upper room the power that's in you today is the same power that came on them in the upper room it's got the same strength that hasn't lessened it hasn't diluted over time it's the same power the same power that when Peter walked by the crippled man in a shadow went across him Peter never entered a word and I believe this bride will get to the point before the Rapture takes place when she will speak with his words she will speak the word with his words English language that comes off the tongue of son and daughter of God in this bride when it's anointed it has the same power as God had when he said let there be light it's the same power you will speak you will say come forth you will say push away the stone there's no nothing that hell will bring against you no power that hell has that they will bring against you that you can't say be gone Glory we will get to that point you can believe it or not but if that power is in you it will have to manifest itself I found that so striking the night when brother Donnie was preaching about the The Mercy Seat how brother Brandon was was talking about how God put the mercy seat on our in the human heart that's where he sits on that Mercy Seat and you say that God dwells in there how how awesome it was for them after the veil was written too in the temple before then you couldn't go into the holiest of holies only that the priest could go in there and they had to be dressed a certain way they had to be washed a certain way they had to carry a certain kind of incense before they went in there and when when Jesus died and when he said I go away and I come back again and I'll be with you even in you I'll be sitting on the mercy seat of your heart before when you couldn't go into the holiest of holies now the holiest of holies came into man it's now in you you have all access anything you need you don't have to say a certain prayer do your thing a certain way like my Irish do I had to throw it in there for something Michael Bailey you don't have to do those things it's free access because it's in here you have everything you need for a resurrection you have everything you need for health I would let you prosper and be in good health everything you need for that is right here I don't care what your symptoms are I don't care what your circumstances are I don't care how depressed you are kind of anxiety I don't care if your children are lost I don't care if your parents are lost God said the prophet said you claim them you claim them and then you believe in the promise it doesn't matter how far away they are from God it doesn't matter what they say about this message it's what God Said start pushing the stone away and believe that the power that is in here will be the one that speaks come forth thank you brother Branham said in the deity of deity of Jesus Christ let the fundament fundamentalists let them people who deny the power of God say it's wrong but that same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that got the Holy Ghost the voice that said let there be life let there be light right Let There Be Waters Let There Be man Let There Be animals the same God that created all that there's not a Lesser God in here it's the same one it's the same one all that God was he poured into Christ all the Christ was he poured into the bride right so you have it whenever God pours himself into Christ and when it got poured from Christ and the bride you didn't get a weaker portion you got a portion but that portion that you got is strong as it was in God before he poured it into Christ go listen if nobody's ever listened to the the the sermon I think in 49 it was well the brand preached a sermon in 49 called faith simple simple and that's why I I I like things I bet I've listened to that sermon probably more than any other sermon of other brand has got that in the message is faith if that don't if it don't pick you up and give you faith and start pushing stones and having resurrections there ain't nothing in this message that will do it for you then if that won't do it for you every message he preached was the power of God every message he preached will give you faith or to remove all doubt says that's right men and women it's time that we found that we found out who you are the devil is trying to hide you back tell you that you're a little cowed around something you're not your sons and daughters of God the deity is not in heaven it's in you I know you think I'm crazy but let me tell you something brother when you realize almighty God lives in you immortal life my life I give Zoe the life of God is in the human being we've got no reason we've got no reason to not believe we've got no reason to not have faith the life of God is in you are we using that are we are we submitting ourselves to that it's not you controlling it you know you hear people say I I can't I've had friends of mine I can't live it say I can't I can't live this what's not up to you to live it's not up to you to live it's let him live through you you couldn't live this message as you if you tried like brother Reid was saying earlier he said I tried and tried the more I tried to worship God you can't try you have to let God do the living you do the submitting that's why in James when it says resist the devil and flee from you he tells you to submit yourself first to God first if you haven't submitted he's going to flee from you he's not those stones are gonna if you haven't submitted to God you start commanding stones to be to roll to be pushed back it ain't going to happen if you haven't submitted yourself to God because you're trying to do it you're trying to work it up you don't have to work God up he's already there [Music] you don't have to go lay hands on your battery outside in your car every time you start your car Lord I pray that this this car will start we don't even think about it anymore do we you don't have to think about breathing when you wake up in the morning that's the Simplicity of God that's how simple God wants to make it don't think about breathing when you get up Just Breathe don't think about healing when you're sick just be healed don't think about being delivered be delivered [Applause] you think Satan hasn't heard that voice before when the power of God comes in your life and you speak to that problem in your life he's heard that voice before he heard it at the grave of Lazarus he heard it when Jesus went into hell and took the keys from him he heard it when God when when all the Through the Ages when God spoke to the prophet when the prophets were speaking it was God speaking through them he heard it then he knows that voice [Music] he knows when it's him and he knows when it's you he's no dummy the Bible says he's a worthy adversary of this flesh but to God he's no more than like brother Melvin knock that thing off my shoulder that's all right that's all he is to God you're bugging me well we got to get to the point where we speak if you don't we got to have confidence in what's been given to us that's faith Lord I don't know how you're going to do it I don't know when you're going to do it but I believe you're going to do it Lord help me take my hands off of it so many times we put our hands on things we shouldn't be putting our hands on When God says I'll fix your problem I and I've said it before I have tried to fix my problems so many times the biggest message that I've ever been in is problems I've tried to fix but Jimmy problems that I've tried to fix is the biggest message that I've been in you'll find out I promise you 100 if you take your hands off of it and say God I give it to you it'll be fixed maybe not the way you expected it to but when God says it's fixed it's fixed who this Melchizedek I'm gonna change it real quick here for about five minutes and then we'll we'll close then after you've recognize the very word of God was Eagle food then you left the other thing you have been formed into the living image of the Living God you have been formed into the living image of God Jesus was God in flesh right you are God in flesh swallow that you are the living image of God when you and brother Branham says in you when you heard that you recognize this word of God was Eagle food you heard from your theophany and what is a theophany brother Brandon said though this Earth with Tabernacle be dissolved we have another body waiting for us over there he said that was your theophany who you think is going to call you from the grave if you go by the way of the grave who's going to roll your stone away brother Joel if you go by a way of the grave you're still Rolling Stones you're still pushing Stones back sister Linda brother Jimmy gets to push a stone back when mother Jimmy stew often he comes down he's all he's going to do is speak why it's his life it's the life of God in that theophany you are a continued thought of God your theophany is a continued thought of God you're content the continued thought of God says you will raise your own body if you go by the way of grave that was in God's thought before the foundation of the world so brother Jimmy you'll come down there and say Jim Bob come forth he probably won't be Adams by then every single Adam every single cell will come back together and it'll raise him out of the grave it's the power and you have that power in you now right now Lord don't let me wait for my theophany to call my body if I have to go by the way of the Grave let me throw some Stones today let's Stand Together you ain't got to wait till then to roll Stones there's people sitting beside you that need a Stone Road out of their life don't don't wait till the rapture just decide to start Rolling Stones there's people that right beside you today that need help there's people beside you right now that need to hear the words come forth Humanity has to be involved Humanity has to be involved you might be the one to take those dirty stinking grave clothes off of them by coming up here and praying through with them praising God for deliverance in their life we all have a part to play No Doubt Mary and Martha got so discouraged they know they'd sent for Jesus Jesus had always come he had always come this was his closest friends and this couldn't those things happen in our life the darkest moments it's at that darkest moments brother Brandon said that crucial crucifying hour when the doctor said there's no more hope when the doctor says it's over send her home there's no hope for him there's nothing more we can do send him home call Hospice we've seen God deliver out of that why because somebody was pushing some stones a lot of times Lazarus couldn't move that stone Lazarus couldn't speak himself out of there he needed family he need brothers and sisters to push that stone away I hope and pray to God that after today that we get the mindset let me I've preached all over myself in this Lord help me be more compassionate to other people's needs Lord help me to help somebody that needs Deliverance I I don't I don't want to I don't want to just go on and worry about myself I want to I don't want to be just Lord I got to take care of myself first I need healing I need Deliverance I need financial help I need this I promise you if you set your heart on somebody else God will take care of yours God will take care of your needs because it ain't about you anyways it's about the glory of God it's about God getting glory in other people's lives brother Brandon said in faith now each one of you have power the same way because you are Sons and Daughters of God that very Spirit that's in you this morning the Holy Spirit that's in you this morning the same holy spirit will raise you up so you have power to raise yourself back up when you die your soul will go under the altar of God not right in the presence of God now your spirit will go to God but you cannot come back remember in the Bible that said the spirit soul is under the altar crying Lord how long how long 144 000 and they would not return until the scripture is fulfilled and like Christ could not return into the scriptures fulfilled then after all that's been done all the suffering is over the brothers Brethren have suffered the same things and we've suffered like they suffered and so forth you'll know exactly where you're buried you'll know where you're at why because they're one they're coming together for a glorified body you'll know exactly where you're buried why because you know all things then yeah your spirit will be turned loose from God and will come to the soul I'm long for that day every present water from the rock brothers sisters I want to ask you something if you are born again of the spirit of God don't have no little weak Parts at big strong parts and I've said here before don't ever say I'm the weakest Christian I'm the least in the kingdom of God if you've got God living in you we're all the greatest you are the greatest in the kingdom of God why because you are him God don't have no weak Parts God don't have no lesser parts God there's no parts of God that's a little stronger you know when they you see when they bring these football players that you know they show their weaknesses and their strengths God don't have no weaknesses if God don't have no weaknesses you don't have any weaknesses whatever you need you have the power it's like a cheat code in a video game cheat code where you can max out your power God Max it out for you when he moved into you you don't have to go buy any you don't have to go borrow any God says I am in you therefore my power is in you he is all together God and if you had enough God in you till it was just barely a shadow that's enough power to make a new Earth remember Peter his shadow crossed that man and he was healed and if you the power of God enough in you till just barely a shadow that's enough power to make a new Earth that's enough power to make a new moon and a new system it's God and it's strong the right ever right now every believer in here has life eternal which is God's spirit in you enough power that will raise up the dead will heal the sick we'll set orbits and condition but you it's controlled by law that spirit's in you you are Sons and Daughters of God that same Spirit that's God in you will raise you up at the day of the Resurrection you say amen amen amen let's pray if you have a need you said brother Joe I I have a need after hearing today I could have more compassion I can look at my problems more differently I can look at my problems more without doubt and worry that's human nature I get it it's Human Nature but we have to get to the point where we can take a rapture if we got anything in this life that is holding us back bitterness grudges unforgiveness doubt worry God can remove all that this morning he can remove every single thing that comes between you and him you don't have to to live your life with guilt and shame of things things you've done and you're afraid people know this people know that Satan talking to you God says I pushed you push the stone back and I've said come forth you don't have to stay in that tomb you don't have to stay in that grave you don't have to claw your way out fight your way out push your way out because I said come forth now when he said come forth he told the body remove those grave clothes show compassion
