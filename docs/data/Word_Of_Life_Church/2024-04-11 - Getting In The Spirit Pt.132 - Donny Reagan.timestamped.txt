[47:32] many many years and it always is a help
[47:36] in pulling and so on so I'm not sure
[47:39] exactly how many youth will'll have I
[47:41] think we have about 190 that are
[47:44] registered for the
[47:46] banquet um but I just like to open up
[47:50] the service for everybody that wants to
[47:53] come but would life for the Youth to
[47:57] have the front part and all you all
[48:04] people
[48:08] okay my goodness you ought to be so
[48:10] happy to be here if you had to set out

[48:20] just um just be in prayer with us that

[48:34] all over the states and we're just
[48:36] looking for a great time in the Lord no
[48:38] doubt some of them need the Holy Ghost
[48:40] some of them might need healing in their
[48:42] body some of them need encouragement
[48:44] just never know what they'll need but
[48:46] we're just looking to see what the Lord
[48:48] will do we know that whenever we come
[48:50] with
[48:51] expectation it it always brings
[48:54] wonderful things to pass so now you
[48:58] won't be able to be at the banquet
[49:00] because that has to be reservation and
[49:02] all that sort of thing but as far as the
[49:05] regular Services here in the sanctuary
[49:07] everybody is welcome you just have to
[49:09] forfeit your seat Sister Janet and won't
[49:11] be able to set
[49:13] up and sister Carol you'll have to move
[49:15] back
[49:16] too and brother Rob and Sister
[49:20] Sarah but I think it'll be worth it
[49:22] don't you yes amen let's turn if you
[49:26] would tonight Revelation 10 verse
[49:35] 1 what a great hour that we're
[49:38] living signs and the
[49:42] skies earthquakes in diverse places yes
[49:46] all different types of things that are
[49:48] happening all around
[49:50] us our
[49:52] nation started already turning its back
[49:55] on Israel
[49:58] right and we know that inevitably all
[50:02] the nations of the earth will God
[50:05] prophesied through the lips of Jeremiah
[50:08] in the Old Testament and said that he
[50:10] would make Jerusalem a stone a heavy
[50:13] Stone and it would be a Troublesome
[50:16] thing all the nations of the Earth would
[50:20] go against
[50:22] Jerusalem so you can see that we're
[50:24] already headed in that way just this
[50:27] week in Michigan people that were
[50:31] protesting our government supporting and
[50:34] sending missiles and so
[50:36] on and for those that are ignorant
[50:38] enough to
[50:40] believe that the Palestinians love
[50:43] you you know what they were saying when
[50:45] they were marching in Dearborn Michigan
[50:47] on Monday death to Israel and death to
[50:53] America now these are American
[50:59] citizens
[51:01] yeah and it has to come what are they
[51:04] doing getting together the anointing is
[51:07] already here amen don't you understand
[51:10] when the bride is gone Satan does not
[51:13] have a decade he does not have 20 years
[51:17] he's only got a short time all this
[51:20] stuff is going on behind the scene
[51:22] tonight when the bride's gone that day
[51:26] he will start assuring his position on
[51:29] the Earth right oh I'm glad I'm getting
[51:32] ready for another thing amen besides
[51:35] that sort of thing amen now let's read
[51:38] Revelation 101 and I saw another Mighty
[51:41] Angel come down from heaven clothed with
[51:45] a
[51:45] cloud and a rainbow upon his head and
[51:49] his face as it were the Sun and his feet
[51:54] as pillars of Fire
[51:57] so he is clothed with a cloud rainbow
[52:01] upon his head his face as it were the
[52:05] Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and
[52:10] he had in his hand a little book open
[52:13] and he set his right foot on the sea and
[52:18] his left foot on the earth now remember
[52:22] Footprints means
[52:25] possession and cried with a loud voice
[52:29] as when a lion
[52:32] Roth and when he had cried seven
[52:35] Thunders uttered their voices and when
[52:39] the seven Thunders had uttered their
[52:41] voices I was about to write and remember
[52:45] John was hearing something that actually
[52:47] wasn't in the Old Testament or the new
[52:52] and he was fixing to write it down
[52:55] that's what he was told to do the things
[52:58] you see and hear write them down so he
[53:01] picks up his pen to write on the
[53:04] parchment and he says when the seven
[53:06] Thunders had uttered their voices I was
[53:08] about to write and I Heard a Voice from
[53:10] Heaven saying unto me seal up those
[53:14] things which the seven Thunders uttered
[53:17] and write them not so John did not write
[53:21] him so what was it now on the a of
[53:24] patmas that heard the voice voice of the
[53:27] seven Thunders was it a
[53:28] pastor was it a teacher an
[53:32] evangelist a pope no a priest no a
[53:37] prophet amen so a prophet heard what the
[53:40] seven Thunders said and he was told seal
[53:44] it up don't write it so what office do
[53:47] you believe that it will require in the
[53:51] last days to be able to point us in the
[53:54] direction of what the seventh under are
[53:57] it's not going to be a pastor it's not
[53:58] going to be an evangelist it's not going
[54:00] to be a teacher what's it going to be
[54:02] answer me it's going to be a prophet
[54:05] because that's what God Reveals His
[54:07] secrets to his servants the prophets now
[54:11] he said and the angel which I saw stand
[54:13] upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted
[54:15] up his hand to heaven and swear by him
[54:19] that liveth forever and ever who created
[54:22] heaven and the things that therein are
[54:24] and the earth and the things that
[54:25] therein are and the Sea and the things
[54:28] which are therein that there should be
[54:30] time no longer and remember it's not
[54:33] tick tock tick tock tick tock that there
[54:35] ain't going to be no more time there'll
[54:36] be time even in the Millennium but the
[54:39] time for the denominational ages is run
[54:44] out time no longer verse seven but in
[54:48] the days of the voice of the seventh
[54:51] angel am when he shall begin to sound
[54:56] list now it's not a
[54:57] group it's
[55:00] one it's
[55:01] one when he shall begin to sound the
[55:04] mystery of God should be finished as he
[55:06] hath declared to his servants notice the
[55:10] office again not the pastors not the
[55:13] Evangelist not the teachers but the
[55:16] prophets why the word of the Lord comes
[55:20] to the
[55:21] prophets for those of you that wasn't
[55:23] with us last night I am not made nor is
[55:27] any other of the fivefold ministry other
[55:29] than a pastor to where I can receive an
[55:33] infallable word in from the fourth
[55:37] dimension in the form of a vision the
[55:40] way a prophet can it might be right and
[55:44] it might be wrong you see that's the
[55:47] thing with gifts it's amazing how gifts
[55:50] are I saw them in Pentecost and there'd
[55:53] be people that would call you out and
[55:55] tell you things
[55:57] it was
[55:58] 100%
[56:00] accurate the next person they call out
[56:03] May Miss at a th000
[56:07] miles I was in a meeting one night and a
[56:09] man called a woman out I won't him tell
[56:11] you what he done cuz just wasn't
[56:14] decent actually he called her out he
[56:17] called me out and told me what I had
[56:21] prayed that day the words the very
[56:26] words I said to God come to find out the
[56:31] man had girlfriends all over places his
[56:34] traveling but you see that's the way
[56:37] those gifts can be so God cannot commit
[56:40] revealing of his word to that type of a
[56:43] gift hit Miss hit Miss hit Miss so he
[56:48] picked an infallible way which is
[56:52] prophets so he can Inspire them in such
[56:54] a way and give them the the power of
[56:56] infallibility now remember every word
[56:58] that comes out of their mouths is not
[57:00] infallible because they're human beings
[57:02] but when that infallibility is there we
[57:05] better listen amen
[57:07] amen God bless you how many has a need
[57:10] tonight before the Lord before we pray
[57:12] amen me too brother Frank Williams had a
[57:15] request for a prayer cost tonight we
[57:17] want to remember that as well also
[57:19] brother Ron Spencer he's doing doing
[57:22] very well he had U three stance put in
[57:25] and and um he's still weak um I've been
[57:29] in touch with him every day multiple
[57:31] times during the day just checking on
[57:32] him and uh wanted us to remember him of
[57:35] course in prayer that the Lord just
[57:36] continue to strengthen him U his
[57:39] cardiologist I want him to do some
[57:40] therapy and things like that where he
[57:42] can be able to get his strength back we
[57:44] believe the Lord can help take care of
[57:46] that too don't we yes we do amen
[57:49] heavenly father it's such a privilege
[57:51] for us to be gathered here tonight Lord
[57:52] once again we thank you dear God for the
[57:56] end time Gathering we thank you for the
[57:58] events that we can see happening upon
[58:00] the Earth many of them Lord because
[58:02] we're in that negative cycle or so sad
[58:04] right now we see such Darkness upon the
[58:07] face of the Earth we see Lord Jesus that
[58:10] men are groping in darkness and Isaiah
[58:12] said that it would be this way but
[58:14] because we're living under the law of
[58:16] contrast he said Gross Darkness would be
[58:19] upon the Earth the darkness on the earth
[58:22] and then the gross Darkness upon the
[58:23] people and then he said but for us us to
[58:27] arise and shine for our light has come
[58:31] so it shows us it'll be a time of great
[58:33] contrast the light of God will be so
[58:36] bright and shining in such a tremendous
[58:39] way and yet the world will be groping in
[58:43] total darkness Lord Jesus we're so
[58:46] grateful tonight for the light that
[58:48] you've given to us we pray that You' be
[58:49] mindful of us in this service father you
[58:52] see this prayer call this request of
[58:54] brother Frank has sent in father in the
[58:55] name name of Jesus would you grant it
[58:57] hundreds of people raise their hands
[58:59] here tonight Lord with different needs
[59:00] in their home their body their finances
[59:03] whatever it is would you meet that need
[59:05] Lord I pray tonight father that you'd
[59:07] help me I'm so needy Lord God to stand
[59:10] before your people and try to bring the
[59:12] word of God help me Father shut my mouth
[59:15] to anything that would be displeasing to
[59:17] you anoint me anoint the people may you
[59:20] receive glory to yourself we ask in
[59:23] Jesus name and the Saints said amen
[59:26] amen God bless you you may be
[59:35] seated
[59:38] elik was similar to
[59:43] Adam once he crossed the
[59:47] chasm he could not redeem his
[59:49] inheritance and we've been looking at
[59:51] Revelation 10 and Ruth chapter 4 four
[59:57] because it's a parallel from the Old
[59:59] Testament to the new and Ruth being a
[1:00:03] gentile one that was needing a redeemer
[1:00:09] a kinsman
[1:00:11] redeemer elik which had
[1:00:14] backslid left his land of
[1:00:17] inheritance because there was a
[1:00:20] famine and we see that many of God's
[1:00:23] people down to the age has done very
[1:00:27] similar when times get hard and things
[1:00:30] are difficult and their faith is being
[1:00:33] tried instead of standing where they
[1:00:36] should stand on the promise they do like
[1:00:40] Abraham did like Isaac did like many of
[1:00:44] the people did elik did exactly the same
[1:00:46] thing so instead of sticking it out and
[1:00:50] waiting for God to bring a Deliverance
[1:00:53] of bread what did they do they went to
[1:00:56] the country which God called his wash
[1:01:02] pot Moab is my wash pot in other words
[1:01:09] that's where God washed his hands and
[1:01:12] washed his feet remember it's a
[1:01:14] symbolism so God said that this is a
[1:01:18] place of dirt and
[1:01:21] filth this is a place of filthy wash
[1:01:26] water it's not a very good place to live
[1:01:29] is it so elik lost faith and when he
[1:01:34] lost faith he left the place that God
[1:01:38] had ordained for him to stay I don't
[1:01:41] know what God would have done I don't
[1:01:44] know what God would have done in the
[1:01:45] days of Abraham or in the days of Isaac
[1:01:48] but I believe with all of my heart if we
[1:01:50] stay where God has put us God will move
[1:01:55] and none of his promises that he ever
[1:01:57] made will ever fall to the ground and
[1:01:59] not come to pass you believe that so God
[1:02:03] no doubt would have moved for Abraham he
[1:02:05] would have moved for Isaac he would have
[1:02:07] moved for elik he did for others others
[1:02:11] stayed in the land they stayed there
[1:02:14] they waited on God they waited on the
[1:02:16] promise of God they didn't starve they
[1:02:18] didn't die they waited it out and God
[1:02:21] moved for them but there's always been
[1:02:24] that type of around the move of God and
[1:02:27] when times get hard they just can't take
[1:02:30] it so they go to looking for the easier
[1:02:34] way the way that is not really the way
[1:02:37] of face but the way of reasoning and the
[1:02:40] way of understanding and the way of the
[1:02:43] intellect well it just makes sense you
[1:02:45] know I I've already believe it'd be
[1:02:47] easier and wouldn't be near as hard if
[1:02:49] we'd go this way and do this and that
[1:02:52] which is exactly what elik did but by
[1:02:55] going there little did he know he would
[1:02:58] never return back to that land little
[1:03:02] did he know by doing this neither him
[1:03:06] nor his two sons would ever return back
[1:03:10] to the promised land similar in The
[1:03:13] Stance as Adam was in the Garden of Eden
[1:03:16] that once Adam listened to his wife's
[1:03:19] reasoning instead of God's word he
[1:03:22] probably didn't know that he'd never be
[1:03:25] able to redeem himself once he crossed
[1:03:30] that Chasm he himself needed Redemption
[1:03:35] so a person needing Redemption cannot
[1:03:40] act a part of a redeemer so elik cross
[1:03:45] the chasm and leaves the land of Judah
[1:03:50] and goes into a wash pot a place of fils
[1:03:56] a place to where they offer their
[1:03:59] children to
[1:04:01] Kos where they will worship Heen idle
[1:04:05] Gods oh you say brother Donnie what
[1:04:08] about Ruth God had to work that out God
[1:04:11] would have got Ruth over there if he had
[1:04:12] to send a lone donkey over there and go
[1:04:15] to Ruth's house and pack her back God
[1:04:18] would have got Ruth don't you think well
[1:04:21] I back I back slid so this can happen
[1:04:23] don't you go to bringing that tray to me
[1:04:26] God don't never lead one of his kids to
[1:04:31] backslide come on somebody God don't
[1:04:34] never make you backslide or you or
[1:04:36] anyone else so that you can have a
[1:04:39] testimony what kind of testimony is that
[1:04:42] if we will stay where God wants us to be
[1:04:46] I guarantee you that'll be one of the
[1:04:47] greatest testimonies we can ever have in
[1:04:49] our entire
[1:04:51] life but once elik crossed that line and
[1:04:55] he himself now stands in the need of a
[1:04:59] redeemer there was a breach between him
[1:05:03] and his land so it's not like that he
[1:05:05] can just walk back okay okay you know
[1:05:08] what I made a mistake I'm very sorry I
[1:05:10] realize it now and I'll just go back to
[1:05:12] where I come from no you see once he
[1:05:14] crossed that breach he could never get
[1:05:18] back I've often wondered what Adam must
[1:05:21] have thought no doubt he didn't think it
[1:05:23] totally through what he must have
[1:05:25] thought and and we know what should have
[1:05:28] happened actually in the Garden of Eden
[1:05:30] that Adam should have never taken Eve
[1:05:33] back to himself oh no the prophet
[1:05:35] declares it to us that once she did such
[1:05:38] a thing her and the serpent should have
[1:05:42] been burnt right he should have never
[1:05:45] went back to her again she should have
[1:05:47] been burnt with the serpent
[1:05:51] amen but you see God knew that Adam
[1:05:54] would do this and yeah he's acting out
[1:05:56] Grace and he's acting out in the timee
[1:06:00] but yet he still stepped over the word
[1:06:02] by doing it so now he himself finds
[1:06:06] himself in the need of a redeemer so he
[1:06:10] stands there in that place and he
[1:06:13] actually saves his wife he saves his
[1:06:17] wife because if he had not taken her to
[1:06:20] himself then God would have killed her
[1:06:23] but because the seed of Adam had been
[1:06:27] sown in her God would not kill her she
[1:06:31] is now a mother and he steps out and for
[1:06:36] gives up everything forsakes his sunship
[1:06:39] forsakes his godship forsakes everything
[1:06:43] that he had in order to save his wife
[1:06:46] but by Saving her he lost
[1:06:50] himself don't you understand what
[1:06:53] reconciliation in the garden of
[1:06:56] Gethsemane was doing to reconcile what
[1:06:59] Adam did in the Garden of Eden the first
[1:07:03] Adam walked out with his wife and the
[1:07:06] second Adam had to forsake his sunship
[1:07:10] In The Garden of
[1:07:12] Gethsemane oh my I want you to listen to
[1:07:15] this now the breach Adam could not meet
[1:07:17] the requirements of redemption after he
[1:07:20] found he lost it he had sinned and it
[1:07:24] separated him himself from God and was
[1:07:27] on this side of the
[1:07:30] chasm so he could not redeem it he just
[1:07:33] couldn't do it because he needed
[1:07:36] Redemption himself so he could not do it
[1:07:39] so a person that needed Redemption could
[1:07:43] not fully redeem and bring back what he
[1:07:47] had forfeited Moses couldn't do it
[1:07:50] Jeremiah couldn't do it no Priest No
[1:07:52] prophet and here is the Dilemma
[1:07:56] of God being on the other side of the
[1:07:58] chasm man being now on this side of the
[1:08:01] chasm and every human being that would
[1:08:04] be born by natural sex Asar would be
[1:08:07] born automatically on this side of the
[1:08:11] chasm how is God ever going to produce a
[1:08:15] Kinsman that does not need Redemption
[1:08:20] himself how will God ever bring such a
[1:08:24] creation into the earth when every man
[1:08:27] that is born of a woman is born of the
[1:08:31] woman tree which is the tree of death
[1:08:36] there were two trees there in the Garden
[1:08:38] of Eden the tree of life and the tree of
[1:08:39] death and the woman was the tree of
[1:08:42] death that's why the prophet said when
[1:08:44] you see a naval attached to a human
[1:08:47] being what do you see a renegade sir a
[1:08:51] renegade come on now a renegade so how
[1:08:54] is God than ever you know the devil must
[1:08:57] have scratched his head for years trying
[1:09:00] to understand how is God ever going to
[1:09:04] bring this back and then God himself was
[1:09:07] the first prophesier of the Messianic
[1:09:10] scriptures in the Garden of Eden and he
[1:09:12] be to let out different parts of the
[1:09:15] Messianic prophecies but God never said
[1:09:18] it in such a way where you could just
[1:09:20] link it one two 3 4 five six seven but
[1:09:23] he would say it in such a way
[1:09:25] describing two different comings or
[1:09:28] advents of the Messiah and say it in
[1:09:32] such a way well that spiritual
[1:09:34] understanding You' never be able to see
[1:09:36] it you can see why the Jews picked
[1:09:39] Messianic scriptures and Messianic
[1:09:42] prophecies that they believed with all
[1:09:44] of their heart and when they put it
[1:09:47] together they had a son of David a
[1:09:49] conqueror a mighty king they could not
[1:09:53] understand a virgin conceiving they
[1:09:55] could not understand him becoming a
[1:09:58] curse in the eyes of God they had quotes
[1:10:01] as we would say they had quotes from The
[1:10:04] Prophet's messages but yet they put it
[1:10:07] together under their understanding and
[1:10:09] they had a general coming not a baby
[1:10:13] they had a mighty conquering general not
[1:10:16] a baby that was going to be born a baby
[1:10:19] that would be born and live and grow up
[1:10:22] and die and become a curse and hang on a
[1:10:26] cross there's no way that was not in
[1:10:29] what they had it put together that did
[1:10:31] not represent their ideology I'll tell
[1:10:34] your friends if we're not careful we'll
[1:10:36] do the same
[1:10:38] thing may God help us you can see why a
[1:10:41] man misses so much the revelation of God
[1:10:45] because God says it in such a way and he
[1:10:48] will say it in such a way that it looks
[1:10:51] as if though this application could be
[1:10:53] right and it looks as if though this
[1:10:56] application could be right and both of
[1:10:58] them are using prophetic statements and
[1:11:02] yet they both are right but they had
[1:11:05] them wrong
[1:11:07] dispensation one prophet's quotes did
[1:11:09] not go contrary to the other but they
[1:11:11] could not lace it together and make it
[1:11:14] fit the way the spirit of God did well
[1:11:17] who did brother Donnie the elect of God
[1:11:20] the elect of God because they had
[1:11:23] special Insight by the very power of God
[1:11:27] that's what it's going to take for us in
[1:11:28] the last day now when Adam then heeds
[1:11:32] notice what he says here again when Adam
[1:11:35] sinned by heeding his wife's reasoning
[1:11:37] instead of holding to God's word that's
[1:11:39] what made Adam sin so he listened to his
[1:11:43] wife's reasoning instead of holding to
[1:11:46] God's word and that's what made Adam sin
[1:11:49] his wife reason with Satan and then
[1:11:52] produced the product to Adam and Adam
[1:11:55] turned loose the word and sold
[1:11:59] out he lost also his inheritance when he
[1:12:03] lost his fellowship and right to life
[1:12:07] remember the day you eat thereof that
[1:12:09] day you die when he lost his life he
[1:12:12] also lost his inheritance in life
[1:12:17] because he had completely Supreme
[1:12:20] control of the earth now listen at what
[1:12:23] our first father was on the Earth Earth
[1:12:25] he was a god of the earth God's the god
[1:12:30] of the universe everywhere but his son
[1:12:35] had this Earth under his own control now
[1:12:39] I want you to listen to me carefully so
[1:12:41] you don't misunderstand me before Jesus
[1:12:44] ever became the Son of God in
[1:12:48] flesh Adam was the first one now
[1:12:52] remember in the beginning was the word
[1:12:55] which was the logos so before Jesus
[1:12:59] became Jesus the man he was the logos
[1:13:02] which was the word so God burst out of
[1:13:06] the Eternal essence of his being
[1:13:09] something in time that could bear His
[1:13:13] Image something in time that could be
[1:13:17] tangible you follow me God thought of
[1:13:19] himself as being a human being he was
[1:13:23] invisible we know that
[1:13:25] and Jesus even said it in St John 4 God
[1:13:28] is a spirit and they that worship Him
[1:13:30] must worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:13:33] and then Paul comes in Timothy and says
[1:13:35] now unto the king Eternal Immortal
[1:13:39] invisible the only wise God be dominion
[1:13:43] and power forever so he is invisible and
[1:13:47] yet he wanted to have a visibility about
[1:13:51] his image so he separates from himself
[1:13:54] the thought
[1:13:55] of himself becoming tangible he wanted
[1:13:58] to become a man but he did not now
[1:14:03] Express Jesus as we know him in the
[1:14:06] Garden of Eden think of it if Jesus
[1:14:10] would have been in the Garden of Eden
[1:14:13] there would have been no
[1:14:14] fault he would have never done what Adam
[1:14:17] did but God allowed Adam Adam which is
[1:14:22] the Hebrew word which means actually
[1:14:24] read because he was taken from the dust
[1:14:27] of the earth so God allowed him in that
[1:14:30] Spirit form when Adam was in the image
[1:14:33] of God and remember in the image of God
[1:14:36] created he them male and female created
[1:14:39] he them so when you would have looked
[1:14:42] you would have saw one image walking
[1:14:44] around in the Garden of Eden it would
[1:14:47] have been one yet plural one yet plural
[1:14:52] God created them and God called their
[1:14:56] name Adam so there was no Eve by
[1:15:00] separate name till actually she
[1:15:01] committed adultery actually she
[1:15:03] committed adultery then she gets her own
[1:15:06] name now in the spirit form the man in
[1:15:10] Genesis one now there's a man in Genesis
[1:15:12] 1 there's another man in Genesis 2
[1:15:15] there's another man in Genesis 3 which
[1:15:17] is the prophecy of Christ of course and
[1:15:19] the man in Genesis 1 became the same man
[1:15:23] in Genesis 2 put in the dust of the
[1:15:26] Earth the man in Genesis 1 as long as he
[1:15:30] remained in that form he could not fall
[1:15:33] he could only fall once he was placed in
[1:15:38] chapter two when that man was put in
[1:15:41] dust well I hope you're hearing me
[1:15:42] tonight it's actually the same way with
[1:15:45] you and I if we would have never been
[1:15:48] put in dust and we would have come
[1:15:50] straight from the mind of God then we
[1:15:53] could have never fallen either preach
[1:15:55] with me now but once we come from the
[1:15:58] mind of God and then we were put in this
[1:16:01] dust it broke us down don't you
[1:16:03] understand what a dust body does you
[1:16:06] understand the Lord Jesus himself being
[1:16:09] the logos which could appear disappear
[1:16:12] theophonic form of course and he would
[1:16:14] pick up a body like he did in Genesis 18
[1:16:17] he would appear step into that body com
[1:16:19] complete a portion of his work for
[1:16:21] Abraham in that day and then go right
[1:16:23] back into that Andis ability again the
[1:16:26] body fall right back down to the dust of
[1:16:28] the earth he never had a permanent flesh
[1:16:30] body until it was conceived of a virgin
[1:16:34] because this is what he wanted but once
[1:16:37] a man takes on flesh the logos the Lord
[1:16:41] Jesus the Christos of God once he took
[1:16:44] on flesh he actually become weak once he
[1:16:49] took on flesh he could fight battles the
[1:16:53] way what is that there's something about
[1:16:55] this it even brought the Son of God to a
[1:16:59] state that the prophet said he was
[1:17:02] tempted by women he was tempted by
[1:17:05] drinking he was tempted in all points
[1:17:08] like as we are yet without sin is that
[1:17:12] right you see the Son of God which
[1:17:15] preexisted in that theophonic form as
[1:17:18] the logos but once he stepped into flesh
[1:17:23] it made him sub to The Domain and the
[1:17:26] desires and the Dominion of humanity and
[1:17:30] had it not been of who he was there's no
[1:17:34] way that he could have ever been the
[1:17:36] Redeemer just by the flesh itself that's
[1:17:39] why the prophet said it stumbles people
[1:17:41] in the message that he said even the
[1:17:44] Flesh of Jesus could not glory in the
[1:17:48] presence of God well I'm sorry some of
[1:17:51] y'all didn't know that even the Flesh of
[1:17:54] Jesus could not Glory now remember he
[1:17:57] was not called Lord Jesus Christ in the
[1:18:02] four gospels the angel did not say thou
[1:18:07] shalt call his name Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:11] but the angel said Thou shalt call his
[1:18:14] name Jesus ah Jesus Jus did not say Lord
[1:18:20] Jesus Christ when do we find him getting
[1:18:24] the name Name Lord Jesus Christ in the
[1:18:28] book of Acts after his Ascension after
[1:18:32] he appears before the
[1:18:35] elders in the
[1:18:38] gate and he
[1:18:40] performs the
[1:18:42] ceremony of the
[1:18:45] shoe he performs the
[1:18:49] ceremony of the
[1:18:51] shoe now watch the prophet goes on to
[1:18:53] say about Adam Adam turned loose the
[1:18:56] word and so loud so he lost his
[1:18:58] inheritance and he lost his inheritance
[1:19:00] in life and he lost his fellowship and
[1:19:03] right to life remember the day you eat
[1:19:05] thereof that day you will die so he was
[1:19:08] a God now think of what he forfeited he
[1:19:11] forfeited being a God to become a sinner
[1:19:16] he forfeited the ability to speak to
[1:19:20] trees and if he didn't like it over here
[1:19:23] he would simply look at it and speak to
[1:19:26] it by the word and say be thou removed
[1:19:29] from there and set out over here cuz I
[1:19:32] think you would look better I just got
[1:19:35] my own little opinion about that I
[1:19:37] wonder myself if it wouldn't after Eve
[1:19:39] come along and Sons of God's been moving
[1:19:42] furniture ever since oh
[1:19:47] yeah but you realize that he had all of
[1:19:51] the Earth was under his
[1:19:55] domain this is what God wanted his sons
[1:19:59] to be heir of he wanted them to be
[1:20:05] Gods you see even for the
[1:20:08] theologians the plurality of the word
[1:20:13] Elohim confuses them they don't
[1:20:16] understand it because Elohim can be
[1:20:19] expressed and it's a feminist form of
[1:20:22] eloh Elo Elohim
[1:20:25] and then they look at and say well if if
[1:20:27] it's if it's plural then there must be
[1:20:29] three up
[1:20:31] there actually there's more than
[1:20:38] three Welly that woke you up didn't it
[1:20:41] now listen to me there's more attributes
[1:20:44] of deity than just father son Holy Ghost
[1:20:49] every elect member of God's family is
[1:20:54] part of his
[1:20:56] godhead I know it's going to choke you
[1:20:58] to death tonight but you might as well
[1:20:59] just go ahead and go cuz we're this is
[1:21:01] the way we're going we are part of his
[1:21:07] godhead that's exactly right now what
[1:21:10] stumbles us so much of course is this
[1:21:12] right here and and this is what we focus
[1:21:15] on this is what we look at I told you
[1:21:17] years ago one of the greatest things
[1:21:20] that is going to be in the last days for
[1:21:21] the people of God is to believe what the
[1:21:24] word says about you versus what you know
[1:21:28] about yourself and your own humanity and
[1:21:31] we live in this so stinking thing every
[1:21:33] day of our life and it causes us all
[1:21:35] kind of battles and ups and downs and
[1:21:37] ins and outs and all that and if we're
[1:21:39] not careful we will begin to believe
[1:21:42] this is who we are this is not who you
[1:21:46] are if you are a son or daughter of God
[1:21:50] this is not who you are don't you
[1:21:54] understand Jesus Christ when he was on
[1:21:57] the earth as a man he would only be in
[1:22:00] that sense and that exact image of that
[1:22:04] Humanity for 33 and a half years or
[1:22:07] third whatever it was and once he raised
[1:22:10] up from the dead that body would be
[1:22:13] closed with
[1:22:15] immortality it would look like he did he
[1:22:18] would have the same eyes and hair and
[1:22:20] all of that but he would only bear that
[1:22:23] particular image for 30 years that was
[1:22:26] not who he was him being tempted of the
[1:22:29] devil that's not who he was that's what
[1:22:32] he become to make you who you were he
[1:22:36] wanted to get you here but he had to do
[1:22:39] that in order to cross the chasm he
[1:22:42] could not stay on that side of the chasm
[1:22:45] and say come on over children come on
[1:22:47] over children we say we can't do it
[1:22:50] Jesus we're lost we can't get over there
[1:22:54] and he knew he couldn't so what' he do
[1:22:56] he come down and laid himself as the
[1:22:59] bridge Oh Glory to God in between deity
[1:23:03] and humanity and he touched Humanity on
[1:23:07] one side and spread his arms on the
[1:23:10] other side and said I am the way the
[1:23:14] truth and the life no man can come to
[1:23:18] the father but by
[1:23:20] me so he was the Bri
[1:23:27] Hallelujah in order to become the
[1:23:31] breach he had to
[1:23:34] forsake his
[1:23:37] sunship and die the death of a sinner I
[1:23:41] know this chokes people to
[1:23:44] death D you you're making him that low
[1:23:47] how didn't make him that low he made
[1:23:49] himself that low I'm just telling you
[1:23:51] how low he
[1:23:53] went
[1:23:55] he was not only the Lamb of
[1:23:58] God but he become a
[1:24:02] goat the
[1:24:04] scapegoat for your sins can't you see
[1:24:08] why people that turn that down they
[1:24:10] deserve to go to hell all he went
[1:24:13] through and all the price he paid for us
[1:24:15] and we turn that down we're not fit to
[1:24:17] walk down streets of
[1:24:19] go well praise the Lord so as Adam for
[1:24:24] forfeited so much of his
[1:24:27] domain so he walks in the Garden of Eden
[1:24:30] that morning as a
[1:24:33] God as a God don't you see there's
[1:24:37] something about man he still wants to be
[1:24:39] a god even lost man he wants to be God
[1:24:43] of his life he wants to be God of his
[1:24:46] home he wants a Dominion he wants a
[1:24:48] domain it'll never be returned if it
[1:24:51] don't come back through Jesus
[1:24:53] am
[1:24:54] remember Satan offered it to him said ye
[1:24:57] shall be as Gods knowing good and evil
[1:25:00] what were they before yeah they were
[1:25:03] Gods Not by knowledge but by
[1:25:06] birth Hallelujah creation of God Adam
[1:25:11] could say let this mountain be moved
[1:25:14] over here and it would do it Adam could
[1:25:16] say let this tree be plucked up and
[1:25:19] planted over there it would do it for he
[1:25:21] had
[1:25:22] complete Supreme
[1:25:26] control as a minor
[1:25:29] God under God our
[1:25:34] father because he was a Son of
[1:25:41] God so in the Lamb's Book of
[1:25:45] Life the first name written at the
[1:25:48] top would have been the Lord
[1:25:52] Jesus and the next next one would have
[1:25:55] been
[1:25:59] Adam you didn't know the prophet said
[1:26:01] that what do y'all read all the
[1:26:04] time you didn't know he said the Lamb's
[1:26:06] name was in that book oh yes the Lamb's
[1:26:08] name was there and he said he spoke your
[1:26:11] name when he spoke his he spoke your
[1:26:14] name brother Paul and placed it in that
[1:26:17] book and wrote it indoubly was the word
[1:26:20] that he used in the blood of Jesus
[1:26:22] Christ my name was put on on that book
[1:26:25] before there's ever any Devils your name
[1:26:27] was put on that book before there's ever
[1:26:29] any sin any adultery and a line you tell
[1:26:33] me how Satan will ever keep one of those
[1:26:36] out of that book he can't do
[1:26:38] [Applause]
[1:26:43] it so God had this personal
[1:26:48] diry I'm not sure exactly what it called
[1:26:51] it it could have been called a lot of
[1:26:53] things Lamb's Book of Life The Diary of
[1:26:57] the
[1:27:01] Gods for I am the
[1:27:04] Eternal I am over the
[1:27:06] universe okay let's go back to it again
[1:27:08] now you help me dogs give birth to dogs
[1:27:13] cats give birth toat cows give birth
[1:27:18] to and if God was to ever give
[1:27:22] birth Hallelujah
[1:27:26] would God give birth to Sinners would
[1:27:28] God give birth to Lost no good rotten no
[1:27:30] count for nothing there ain't no way in
[1:27:32] the world you make God rotten if you do
[1:27:35] that so don't you understand when you
[1:27:37] look in the mirror don't you understand
[1:27:40] your eyes cannot see but if God is
[1:27:43] living inside your soul there is a part
[1:27:46] of deity inside of you Church oh
[1:27:50] Hallelujah that's what the Rapture is
[1:27:53] for
[1:27:54] it's the Gathering Together of deity
[1:27:58] don't you understand what the
[1:28:00] resurrection and the Rapture is that
[1:28:02] we're waiting on hallelujah it's the
[1:28:05] Gathering Together of
[1:28:09] [Applause]
[1:28:15] deity notice this in page 8 83 paragraph
[1:28:19] So you see Adam lost his inheritance the
[1:28:22] earth now it passed from his
[1:28:25] hand to the one he sold out
[1:28:28] to so on this day Adam walks in the
[1:28:32] Garden of Eden and he walks in there as
[1:28:35] God of the
[1:28:39] earth he walks
[1:28:41] out a
[1:28:44] sinner he walked in with
[1:28:47] Dominion power of the spoken
[1:28:53] word
[1:28:54] and he walks
[1:28:55] out with a piece of sheep skin wrapped
[1:28:58] around
[1:28:59] him hitting his
[1:29:02] legs and the blood running down his
[1:29:05] legs little Eve with her blonde hair and
[1:29:08] her blue eyes tears falling out of her
[1:29:11] eyes
[1:29:12] now leing over on Adam's
[1:29:15] chest his tears coming down mixing with
[1:29:19] hers running down mixing in with the
[1:29:22] blood and he walks
[1:29:26] out not a
[1:29:28] God not a god
[1:29:32] lost not his soul now but he lost his
[1:29:38] domain he lost his
[1:29:41] power the spoken word left his
[1:29:46] mouth the image of God went from him he
[1:29:50] woke up that morning
[1:29:52] refreshed what must I do today Papa what
[1:29:56] do you want me to do I'm your
[1:29:59] son what do you want me to
[1:30:02] do not knowing by the end of the
[1:30:06] day he would begin to feel an
[1:30:10] emotion that he had never felt
[1:30:13] before he began to watch as the evening
[1:30:15] Shadows come and he knew it was God's
[1:30:18] custom to go to
[1:30:20] church so he went and hid in the trees
[1:30:24] and papa come down at church time but
[1:30:27] Adam wasn't at
[1:30:29] church so the prophet said one of the
[1:30:31] sadest scriptures in the Bible God
[1:30:34] running up and down through the garden
[1:30:36] Adam Adam Adam where are
[1:30:39] you he knew exactly where he was at but
[1:30:43] he was giv him a chance to come out and
[1:30:45] repent like he does
[1:30:48] US finally Adam spoke
[1:30:52] up I
[1:30:54] I hid
[1:30:57] myself I heard your
[1:30:59] voice and I
[1:31:01] was
[1:31:03] afraid the first time that word is
[1:31:07] mentioned out of a human's
[1:31:10] mouth we've experienced fear and Trauma
[1:31:14] I dare say there's not a one of us that
[1:31:17] had it in the
[1:31:18] scope that he had
[1:31:21] it that's all we've known all of our Liv
[1:31:23] life is it not fear in one form or
[1:31:25] another some of y'all remember your
[1:31:27] first one it was when Daddy heading at
[1:31:29] you with a belt or mama with her hand
[1:31:31] spread open like this and you knew you
[1:31:33] was in for it and it was still that fear
[1:31:35] we were born not too long after we were
[1:31:37] born people began to understand and they
[1:31:39] would raiseed their voice and it instill
[1:31:41] something in us but here's a grown man
[1:31:43] that had lived maybe thousands or t
[1:31:45] thousands of years on the earth he had
[1:31:47] never felt this
[1:31:52] emotion he had never never been afraid
[1:31:54] of
[1:31:57] God and now he hears God's voice Walking
[1:32:00] In The Garden in the cool of the day and
[1:32:02] he's paranoid he's fearful he's shaking
[1:32:06] he's trembling maybe sweat breaking out
[1:32:08] on his
[1:32:10] face and all of a sudden God's voice
[1:32:13] seems so so harsh and so
[1:32:17] straightforward he never heard God talk
[1:32:20] like
[1:32:22] that I don't know if you understand it
[1:32:25] or not but do do you relate to it in
[1:32:28] this way that the way you live and where
[1:32:32] you are in God will
[1:32:35] dictate how a preacher has to
[1:32:39] preach and you say wonder wonder why
[1:32:42] sometimes them preachers get so
[1:32:44] Stern wonder why that they're preaching
[1:32:46] hard sometimes cuz there's somebody that
[1:32:50] needs to hear that voice of God in a
[1:32:53] Stern way yeah you see God didn't come
[1:32:55] to oh oh that that's fine Adam no no no
[1:32:58] no don't don't worry about no problem at
[1:32:59] all I mean I'll tell you what I'll just
[1:33:01] Overlook the whole thing y'all can just
[1:33:03] stay here the rest of your life that's
[1:33:05] fine no big deal God is a God of Justice
[1:33:08] and when God's word is broken it must be
[1:33:11] administered according to the promise
[1:33:13] and the promise was death
[1:33:18] amen dear God therefore his eternal life
[1:33:22] is right to the truth of Life his right
[1:33:25] to the Earth belonged to him and he
[1:33:28] forfeit every bit of it to the hands of
[1:33:30] Satan so Satan crawls underneath the
[1:33:33] garden gate the prophet terms it that
[1:33:34] way that morning thinking what can I do
[1:33:37] today I want this place so
[1:33:41] bad that's the way you'll do your
[1:33:44] home that's the way he'll do your life
[1:33:47] that's the way he'll do our
[1:33:49] church but I say we stand and rally
[1:33:52] together and say this is our church this
[1:33:56] is our home this is my life you're not
[1:34:00] getting it devil this is my wife and my
[1:34:03] children this is the way we live this is
[1:34:06] our message you're not getting my
[1:34:09] eternal life you're not getting my
[1:34:12] victory you're not stealing my joy it's
[1:34:15] mine
[1:34:18] [Applause]
[1:34:22] Satan
[1:34:26] so Satan crawls underneath the garden
[1:34:29] gate that
[1:34:30] morning but he walks out the gates that
[1:34:35] night with the
[1:34:42] keys you know I'm sure by reading the
[1:34:44] book of Genesis Adam was not actually
[1:34:47] brought from the dust of the Garden of
[1:34:50] Eden you see there was a place called
[1:34:53] called Eden so Eden was a territory or
[1:34:57] was said like this a state so Adam was
[1:35:01] actually pulled out of the dust in the
[1:35:05] state of Tennessee we'll
[1:35:08] say and then God took him the Bible says
[1:35:11] God took him and placed
[1:35:15] him placed him
[1:35:19] adoption in the Garden of Eden wow in
[1:35:23] the garden ofen God knew this was a
[1:35:26] probationary period had he come from the
[1:35:30] dust of the Garden of Eden it would have
[1:35:33] been more personal claim had I come from
[1:35:36] the spoken word of God my
[1:35:39] Humanity oh Hallelujah sin could have
[1:35:43] never got a hold of me it could never
[1:35:45] got a hold of you but I was
[1:35:49] placed Hallelujah don't you understand
[1:35:52] if you're Eng graced today you were
[1:35:55] placed
[1:35:56] there if you're in the Holy Spirit you
[1:35:59] were placed there yes sir remember there
[1:36:03] was a great probationary period that it
[1:36:06] went on in heaven before Adam was ever
[1:36:08] placed on the earth he knew nothing
[1:36:10] about it myriads of angels had been
[1:36:14] created by the
[1:36:16] Eternal and many of them were placed on
[1:36:19] probation as
[1:36:21] well you see Paul mentions about out an
[1:36:24] elect angels of God in other words they
[1:36:28] couldn't
[1:36:29] fall there were some angels that were
[1:36:32] created and they could fall there were
[1:36:35] other angels that came out of the
[1:36:38] essence of the Eternal you see this is
[1:36:41] why the prophet could say that you never
[1:36:44] was saved on any certain day you always
[1:36:48] was
[1:36:49] saved now there's a part of you that
[1:36:51] never began oh you remember he tells us
[1:36:55] what was up there 1957 he said for those
[1:36:58] of us that stays with that word we were
[1:37:01] a part of those angels that never fell
[1:37:04] before the foundation of the world
[1:37:07] that's right and somebody said amen So
[1:37:11] Adam is now in his
[1:37:14] probation Supreme control who would ever
[1:37:17] thought you could lose Supreme
[1:37:21] control how s
[1:37:25] but I don't mind telling you I bring it
[1:37:27] down to our modern day when I find a son
[1:37:29] or a daughter of God and God Saves them
[1:37:33] and gives them a nice little family and
[1:37:35] they go to living for the Lord and
[1:37:38] another woman will move into the scene
[1:37:40] or another man will move into the scene
[1:37:42] or whirlin will move into the scene and
[1:37:45] they go to you know get doing things
[1:37:46] they wouldn't initially do and they
[1:37:48] don't love the Lord like they used to
[1:37:50] and they don't go to church like they
[1:37:52] used to and they've got this and that
[1:37:54] and the other oh don't you see what
[1:37:56] you're doing you're another Adam and Eve
[1:37:59] you're another Adam and Eve and you're
[1:38:01] walking away from God's provided place
[1:38:03] for you I say to you tonight Adam and
[1:38:06] your Eve we need to stand our ground
[1:38:09] that devil will try to come sliding
[1:38:11] underneath our garden gate remember he
[1:38:13] is a serpent he is a Wy serpent that
[1:38:17] will try to get you and your family and
[1:38:20] your children but you can stand your
[1:38:22] ground and say Satan you are a liar this
[1:38:27] is our property this is our inheritance
[1:38:31] we will not forfeit
[1:38:35] [Applause]
[1:38:37] it he forfeited every
[1:38:42] bit to the
[1:38:44] hands of
[1:38:49] Satan he passed it from his hands
[1:38:54] to Satan you said that's awful how could
[1:38:58] he do
[1:38:59] that same way you
[1:39:01] do some many people you and I know
[1:39:06] do how many people do we know that have
[1:39:08] sat in our
[1:39:10] midst shouted dance said they believe
[1:39:12] the word of the hour now they make fun
[1:39:14] of it ridicule life at it whatever used
[1:39:17] to get drunk on the Holy Ghost used to
[1:39:19] shout under the blessing of God now
[1:39:21] they're drinking liquor yeah come on
[1:39:24] somebody preach with me they used to get
[1:39:26] in Heavenly places oh they got high
[1:39:28] right in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:39:31] but now they got to have a shot or they
[1:39:33] got to have a pill
[1:39:34] why they let their life go into the
[1:39:37] hands of the
[1:39:38] devil oh
[1:39:42] my can't you see why God had to have a
[1:39:47] law of innocent
[1:39:52] substitution that there would be a law
[1:39:54] of
[1:39:55] substitutionary
[1:39:58] value that one which was
[1:40:01] innocent could be accepted as a
[1:40:04] substitute for one who was emphatically
[1:40:08] proven
[1:40:10] guilty watch's this again in the breach
[1:40:13] but God's law received of substitute now
[1:40:16] what if God had not offered to take a
[1:40:19] substitute oh I love this but love
[1:40:23] constrained him to do
[1:40:26] it love constrained him to do
[1:40:30] it that man was without a way back
[1:40:33] there's no way for him to get back he
[1:40:35] was gone but the grace of God met this
[1:40:39] kinsman
[1:40:40] redeemer in the person of Jesus Christ
[1:40:45] law required it Grace met its
[1:40:51] requirements praise praise God I want
[1:40:54] you to notice now law demanded it but
[1:40:57] law could not meet it let me tell you
[1:41:01] some friend we will never be able to
[1:41:04] please God by legalism I know there's a
[1:41:07] great delicate balance and finding that
[1:41:10] between the contrast of legalism and
[1:41:13] liberalism and trying to find well
[1:41:15] where's the balance but if you got the
[1:41:16] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will lead you
[1:41:18] right down the middle of the road I want
[1:41:20] to be legal when legalism was required
[1:41:23] come on somebody I believe in Holiness
[1:41:26] don't you I believe there's dos and
[1:41:27] don'ts in the Bible but to me if you
[1:41:30] fall in love with the author them dos
[1:41:32] and don'ts ain't near as bad as what the
[1:41:34] devil tries to make you look like they
[1:41:36] are anyway because it's not oh I hate to
[1:41:39] do this I wish I didn't have to do that
[1:41:41] your problem is your love life that's
[1:41:44] what's wrong with a lot of message folks
[1:41:46] it's their love life they love the devil
[1:41:49] they love the flesh they love the things
[1:41:51] of the world more than they love God but
[1:41:53] if you fall in love with the Lord Jesus
[1:41:56] then I'll guarantee you one thing
[1:41:57] whatever he wants you to do and you're
[1:41:59] in love with him oh my it is such an
[1:42:02] honor to serve him it's such an honor to
[1:42:05] give up anything that he
[1:42:09] wants oh
[1:42:12] my law required it Grace met its
[1:42:17] requirements Oh Amazing Grace How Sweet
[1:42:20] the Sound he says notice law required a
[1:42:23] kinsman
[1:42:24] redeemer to redeem a lost substance
[1:42:28] Grace met this
[1:42:31] requirement in the person of Jesus
[1:42:35] Christ a Kinsman must be
[1:42:38] born of the human
[1:42:40] race now what the contrast between Boaz
[1:42:45] and Ruth so Boaz not under the
[1:42:50] law but also under grace
[1:42:54] you see law would have kept Ruth
[1:43:00] out because an
[1:43:03] ammonite or a
[1:43:05] moabit could not come to the Lord for 10
[1:43:09] Generations
[1:43:12] 400
[1:43:16] years which also meant King David
[1:43:22] couldn't that's right since he was kin
[1:43:26] to Ruth the more about us that's right
[1:43:30] amen it's just something about us
[1:43:31] Gentiles we love that music and not
[1:43:36] dancing oh I know some of you still
[1:43:38] Baptist and some of it's your Church of
[1:43:40] Christ I'm hoping some of y'all find you
[1:43:41] dance before we Le in the Rapture all
[1:43:44] right I don't mind telling you one thing
[1:43:46] me and little David's going to dance in
[1:43:47] heaven where're some of the resue sat
[1:43:48] there and look at us if you want to but
[1:43:50] I figure we going to have a time but I
[1:43:53] don't want to wait till I get to heaven
[1:43:54] to have a time I like having a time
[1:43:56] right now the way I look at it if people
[1:43:58] can get out of here and carry on the way
[1:44:00] they do for the devil and all of his
[1:44:02] nonsense and here we are saved by the
[1:44:04] grace of God when we was on our way to
[1:44:07] hell we was wretched we was blind we was
[1:44:09] miserable we was naked and he saved us
[1:44:12] and we sat around oh my goodness with a
[1:44:14] mully grubs and we're so sad I think we
[1:44:17] need a good dose of the Holy Ghost and
[1:44:19] joy unspeakable and full of Glory if
[1:44:22] they can jump up at a ball game what's
[1:44:24] wrong with saints of God clapping their
[1:44:27] hands and saying Amen brother preach the
[1:44:30] word that's right brother why because we
[1:44:33] realize where we come from and where
[1:44:36] we're
[1:44:37] [Applause]
[1:44:40] going oh
[1:44:42] Hallelujah notice the Virgin birth
[1:44:45] produced our kinsman redeemer not
[1:44:48] other but the almighty God become
[1:44:52] Emmanuel one of us Emmanuel the kinsman
[1:44:55] redeemer was M you see how God makes a
[1:45:00] requirement and there's nothing we can
[1:45:02] do but then Grace steps in Oh Glory to
[1:45:08] God grace steps in and overshadows the
[1:45:12] law and produces the
[1:45:17] product I hope you understand what I
[1:45:20] just read to you I read to you the con
[1:45:24] of the body
[1:45:27] change don't think you'll ever get to a
[1:45:30] spot oh oh brother Donnie it'll be at
[1:45:33] least 30 days it'll be at least 60 days
[1:45:35] I'll walk a perfect walk before God I
[1:45:37] will be absolutely perfect I'll make no
[1:45:39] mistake it'll be a month or two months
[1:45:41] or my as good as I am it might be a year
[1:45:44] you never know as good as I am you know
[1:45:46] I just live so good and so holy and I'm
[1:45:47] everything I'll probably be just as
[1:45:49] sinless and perfect as I can be if Grace
[1:45:51] don't overshadow us Stone won't even be
[1:45:53] a Rapture what does the bible tell us in
[1:45:56] the Old Testament when that headstone
[1:45:59] would come crying what's he going to cry
[1:46:01] what's it going to cry oh how good you
[1:46:03] are how right you are what's that
[1:46:05] headstone come crying Grace Grace Grace
[1:46:10] Grace why we still need it brother I'm
[1:46:13] going to need it right the very morning
[1:46:15] of the body chain you're going to need
[1:46:17] at the very morning of a body chain
[1:46:20] because I am captured in this old
[1:46:22] Humanity
[1:46:23] it is my enemy it is your enemy but God
[1:46:27] demands Perfection and God said I will
[1:46:31] produce it myself how will you do it God
[1:46:34] even the Rapture will say Grace Grace
[1:46:38] Grace
[1:46:40] [Applause]
[1:46:46] Grace but you see
[1:46:49] Boaz and Jesus Christ both
[1:46:53] wanted the same
[1:46:57] thing an
[1:46:59] irrefutable legal
[1:47:04] possession now Boaz did not want a
[1:47:08] woman that he could take her to
[1:47:12] himself and know
[1:47:14] her and then to or someone else have a
[1:47:18] claim two years three years 5 years down
[1:47:21] the road and say she's
[1:47:24] she was with me 3 weeks after y all got
[1:47:28] married he wanted a legal
[1:47:33] possession the Lord Jesus don't just
[1:47:36] want
[1:47:38] saved people
[1:47:40] on now listen there'll be lots of Saved
[1:47:44] people that will be exactly that saved
[1:47:49] people but Jesus is not going to get
[1:47:52] just saved people pregnated with his
[1:47:56] word right come on somebody the Lord
[1:48:01] Jesus Christ will not send the
[1:48:03] pregnation of his word in an
[1:48:05] individual's heart until he is assured
[1:48:10] that they are a legal possession of his
[1:48:15] their days of boyfriend hunting are
[1:48:19] over wo glory to God God their days of
[1:48:24] looking for another man are over they're
[1:48:28] not looking for another boyfriend
[1:48:30] they're not looking for another lover
[1:48:32] come on somebody they're not looking to
[1:48:35] be conceived with child by another man
[1:48:37] them days are over why because the Lord
[1:48:41] Jesus has done this work so complete
[1:48:44] that the seat of God is already in there
[1:48:47] and the womb is already closed up and
[1:48:50] the oh Hallelujah the devil not so his
[1:48:54] seed of corruption she belongs to
[1:48:59] [Applause]
[1:49:05] him Ruth 4:7 now this was the manner in
[1:49:10] former time in Israel concerning
[1:49:13] redeeming and
[1:49:15] concerning
[1:49:19] changing
[1:49:20] redeeming and changing
[1:49:23] Ching that's what I'm interested in
[1:49:26] redeeming and
[1:49:29] changing you follow me for to confirm
[1:49:33] all things a man plucked off his
[1:49:35] shoe and gave it to his neighbor and
[1:49:40] this was a testimony in Israel therefore
[1:49:43] the Kinsman said unto Boaz buy it for
[1:49:47] thee notice he says it not her
[1:49:55] once he found out she was a
[1:49:57] morius he wouldn't even lower himself to
[1:50:00] recognize
[1:50:03] her you honestly think the devil would
[1:50:06] want
[1:50:07] me you imagine him wanting to take me to
[1:50:10] hell he'd be sick on a horse in about
[1:50:12] three hours no probably wouldn't take
[1:50:14] that long I'd be shouting all over down
[1:50:16] I say come on get saved come on get out
[1:50:18] of this place let the devil let him burn
[1:50:20] in hell come on out of here cuz you see
[1:50:22] even if he was able to get me down there
[1:50:24] I'm still a Son of God when he took
[1:50:25] Jesus down there what Jesus do kicked
[1:50:28] the whole side of Hell in and shut the
[1:50:30] door shut and Jesus come right out of
[1:50:32] there preaching come on children don't
[1:50:34] you think it's your location that makes
[1:50:36] you of the devil if the devil got you
[1:50:38] down in hell he wouldn't want you there
[1:50:40] very long you sister to that long hair
[1:50:43] and them long dresses on and the Holy
[1:50:45] Ghost go to hitting you down there he
[1:50:46] said I'll not leave your soul in hell
[1:50:49] and I'll not leave my Holy One to seek
[1:50:51] corruption why when the devil had you
[1:50:53] out there in them hell ho hold you
[1:50:55] didn't really fit you never was part of
[1:50:58] them even though you was drinking you
[1:50:59] smoking there dope you was living the
[1:51:01] way they live and acting the way they
[1:51:04] acted but there was a predestinated seat
[1:51:06] of God down inside of your soul always
[1:51:09] was there because it come from the
[1:51:11] Eternal himself all you needed was a
[1:51:14] burst all you needed was a spirit of God
[1:51:17] hallelujah to Quicken you and bring you
[1:51:20] out of that mess
[1:51:25] [Applause]
[1:51:29] so this is called the
[1:51:31] ceremony of the
[1:51:37] shoe so
[1:51:40] walking on this
[1:51:43] possession with your shoe meant it was
[1:51:47] yours so each step was an
[1:51:51] investment in your
[1:51:54] property so a transaction would made
[1:51:57] sometimes it would be the seller
[1:51:59] sometimes it would be both seller and
[1:52:01] buyer but it is required of the
[1:52:04] seller the the seller would take off one
[1:52:09] shoe and he would give that shoe to the
[1:52:13] buyer he is instead of investing he
[1:52:18] divesting so he said no
[1:52:21] more
[1:52:23] I give you not my word but my
[1:52:28] shoe I give you my shoe I will never
[1:52:33] tread upon this ground again it is yours
[1:52:38] amen I'll tell you one thing friends I
[1:52:40] get so fighting mad I get so sick of
[1:52:43] that devil robbing us I get so sick of
[1:52:45] that devil stealing a lot of our stuff
[1:52:47] and he ain't even got no right to be on
[1:52:49] our property he ain't got no right to be
[1:52:52] on our property brother Jack and we just
[1:52:54] give him free course and let him come in
[1:52:55] and do whatever he wants to do don't you
[1:52:58] understand the Lord Jesus has already
[1:52:59] paid the price and he's already give you
[1:53:02] the promised Footprints means possession
[1:53:04] but you'll fight for every inch of the
[1:53:06] ground that you get in
[1:53:11] God now actually this is not only in
[1:53:13] scripture but it's also in his history
[1:53:15] as
[1:53:16] well now the removal of the shoe the
[1:53:19] Hebrew ritual that was called by this is
[1:53:22] H
[1:53:23] h a l i t z a h
[1:53:26] halit and it means to draw off one the
[1:53:32] ancient text says when someone sells his
[1:53:34] property he looses permanently or
[1:53:36] temporary his legal right to it and
[1:53:38] lifts up his foot from it and places on
[1:53:42] it the foot of the new
[1:53:48] owner thus by removing his shoe he is
[1:53:52] divesting himself of property
[1:53:56] ownership therefore the Kinsman said
[1:53:58] unto Boaz now we see what to does buy it
[1:54:02] for thee so it's repeated twice to prove
[1:54:07] that it's a double Covenant you ever
[1:54:08] wonder why Jesus in the New Testament
[1:54:09] say verily verily verily verily double
[1:54:14] verily verily now he's not just
[1:54:16] repeating himself because he said her
[1:54:18] Jesus was a stutterer it is a double
[1:54:20] verification listen
[1:54:22] close now notice so he drew off his shoe
[1:54:28] so this was not just a purchase of a
[1:54:31] piece of land but to the spiritual
[1:54:35] mind it was a marriage
[1:54:42] ceremony watch this When sin had been
[1:54:44] confessed and fallen into the blood of
[1:54:46] Jesus Christ it gives an abstract right
[1:54:49] straight back to the Creator again you
[1:54:51] become a Son of God Abstract title deed
[1:54:55] is held in the hand of the
[1:54:57] almighty think of it he had your
[1:55:01] Abstract title
[1:55:04] deed he's had it all these
[1:55:10] years what's he waiting on brother
[1:55:12] Donnie he's waiting on you to claim
[1:55:20] it you can't claim it by belonging into
[1:55:22] a church you can't claim up and say I
[1:55:24] believe God sent a prophet that ain't
[1:55:26] the way you get it everything that was
[1:55:29] ever against you has to be stricken
[1:55:33] off oh my it gives an abstract strip
[1:55:36] back to the Creator again and you become
[1:55:38] a Son of God Abstract title deed is held
[1:55:41] in the hand of almighty God it's
[1:55:43] Redemption means all legal possession to
[1:55:48] all that was lost by Adam and Eve
[1:55:56] see how far we're living from our
[1:55:57] privileges
[1:55:59] tonight oh what that ought to do to a
[1:56:02] born again Christian it's legal
[1:56:05] possession to the abstract title deed of
[1:56:07] eternal life means that you
[1:56:11] possess everything Adam and Eve
[1:56:16] lost brother tnie how can that be so
[1:56:20] because we have it in seed
[1:56:24] form I'm waiting on the full
[1:56:28] manifestation but the prophet gave a
[1:56:30] very simple
[1:56:31] illustration he said if I was
[1:56:34] hungry and someone saw me and they felt
[1:56:38] sorry for me and they would say how much
[1:56:41] how much would a loaf of bread cost you
[1:56:43] you say 25 cents well inflation's really
[1:56:46] went up since then eh so 25 cents now he
[1:56:50] said if they would reach in their pocket
[1:56:52] and give me that 25 cents I could go on
[1:56:55] my way just as happy with that 25 cents
[1:57:00] as if I had that loaf of bread under my
[1:57:02] arm now he said I'm on my way I'm going
[1:57:05] to the store to buy that loaf of bread I
[1:57:07] might have to go through some briers I
[1:57:09] might have to go through some low spots
[1:57:11] but I'm happy because I've got the
[1:57:14] purchase price in my
[1:57:16] hand oh praise God I don't have perfect
[1:57:20] health yet but I've got the 20 5 cents
[1:57:22] it says I'm fixing to get it amen I've
[1:57:26] got gray hairs and I've got wrinkles in
[1:57:28] my face but I ain't what I'm looking at
[1:57:31] I'm looking at the down payment that I
[1:57:32] got in my hand cuz it says I'm fixing to
[1:57:34] be made a young man again after a while
[1:57:37] if I live in a few months I'll be 68
[1:57:40] years old but who knows I might turn 20
[1:57:43] and never turn 68 now it depends you see
[1:57:46] on the will of God and if we realize
[1:57:49] that it would help with the confusion of
[1:57:51] people say well you're saying we got all
[1:57:53] this stuff we got all this stuff where
[1:57:55] in the world is it you've got the
[1:57:57] deposit inside of your soul and you've
[1:58:00] got to stand right there and let God
[1:58:03] give you how much ever he wants you to
[1:58:05] have now I don't want to get it all
[1:58:07] after while in the Millennium I want the
[1:58:10] Earthly part now and the Millennium part

[2:04:14] which he has
[2:04:16] purchased with his own

[2:04:48] were bought by him guess what he owned
[2:04:55] you and believe it or not he considers
[2:04:59] his bride his greatest
[2:05:07] possession let me just share with you my
[2:05:10] heart as I
[2:05:11] close as a

[2:05:57] if time goes on I'll die if we don't all

[2:06:02] step in then it will be his
[2:06:07] responsibility I don't look at you as

[2:12:55] you read your
[2:12:56] Bible but maybe there's just a little
[2:12:59] question
[2:13:00] there would you just raise your hand to
[2:13:02] the Lord Lord would you settle that for
[2:13:05] me tonight father bless you Saints God
[2:13:08] bless you young and old God bless
[2:13:13] you with this token comes an
[2:13:16] assurance it's not a guessing a maybe so
[2:13:20] or perhaps
[2:13:22] but God wants you to know that you know
[2:13:25] that you
[2:13:27] know praise the
[2:13:30] Lord heavenly
[2:13:33] father thank you for coming to this
[2:13:38] earth and doing this great work of
[2:13:40] redemption
[2:13:44] father I don't think we can ever be over
[2:13:47] what you did for
[2:13:49] us no no doubt we see it even now so
[2:13:55] vaguely we say salvation is free and it
[2:13:59] is free to
[2:14:02] us but oh the price you had to
[2:14:05] pay it was so
[2:14:08] high oh Jesus I pray tonight may you
[2:14:11] move across this
[2:14:13] place you that streaming tonight father
[2:14:16] that couldn't be here maybe those that
[2:14:17] go back and archive it from around the
[2:14:19] world wherever they're they're hearing
[2:14:22] it at Lord
[2:14:24] God oh Jesus
[2:14:27] Hallelujah maybe that little family
[2:14:29] there in Scotland Lord in
[2:14:33] Norway up in Iceland wherever they
[2:14:38] are maybe there's one heard their name
[2:14:40] being called tonight
[2:14:42] Lord wasn't me calling
[2:14:45] it but it's the son of man Christ
[2:14:50] anointing his people
[2:14:52] people oh
[2:14:55] Jesus speak your
[2:14:57] word call your last ones in
[2:15:01] Lord so we can leave this wicked sinful
[2:15:05] Place
[2:15:06] father every day it's
[2:15:08] becoming a more unfitted place for us to
[2:15:14] live come Lord
[2:15:17] Jesus take us away
[2:15:22] take us away
[2:15:25] Lord Lord as we just experienced a great
[2:15:28] phenomen of this week of the eclipse and
[2:15:31] the
[2:15:32] moon getting front of the
[2:15:35] sun hearing them talk about it
[2:15:38] scientifically that the sun is 400 times
[2:15:43] larger than the
[2:15:46] moon and yet 400 times farther away
[2:15:52] than the
[2:15:56] moon and I heard this commentator on the
[2:15:58] news saying it shows an intelligent
[2:16:02] design of a
[2:16:03] being that would place them in the orbit
[2:16:06] that they are in the same distance and
[2:16:09] there was explaining how if the moon was
[2:16:11] closer to us it wouldn't be that way or
[2:16:13] if it was farther away there wouldn't
[2:16:16] even be an
[2:16:17] eclipse but you made them the right size
[2:16:21] and you put them in the right
[2:16:24] place Lord Jesus you made us the right
[2:16:28] size
[2:16:29] too and you put us in the right
[2:16:32] place but the moon and the sun's unlike
[2:16:36] us we want to be bigger than you made us
[2:16:38] or little than you made us and we want
[2:16:40] this man's place and that man's place
[2:16:44] and I heard the prophet read it
[2:16:46] yesterday rather he was saying when God
[2:16:49] called me he said to be an evangelist
[2:16:52] and he said I wanted to be a pastor I
[2:16:56] just thought it'd be just nice to stay
[2:16:57] at home I thought my goodness I just
[2:16:59] kind of smiled and chuckled I thought is
[2:17:01] that something even brother brandham
[2:17:04] wanted to be something different than
[2:17:05] what God called him to
[2:17:07] be help us Lord to be able to find our
[2:17:10] rotation around you and your word the
[2:17:14] church will we need to go to the
[2:17:15] ministry that we need to set under the
[2:17:18] people that we need to witness to just
[2:17:20] just the things that we need to be Lord
[2:17:23] help us to find our
[2:17:25] spot and it'll all come together to make
[2:17:29] the Divine
[2:17:30] constellation of the Rapture
[2:17:32] constellation of the end
[2:17:35] time we know you wrote your first Bible
[2:17:38] there in the
[2:17:39] Stars we know them constellations are
[2:17:42] there and they tell stories when you
[2:17:44] come to job you begin to quote to job
[2:17:47] the Bible that he
[2:17:48] knew you mention to him the
[2:17:52] pleades and the Orion
[2:17:55] Urus cuz that was the Bible that job
[2:17:58] knew it declared a
[2:18:01] story in the
[2:18:03] heavens oh
[2:18:06] Jesus cleanse us
[2:18:09] father help us to be more like you Lord
[2:18:12] I
[2:18:14] pray oh we worship you tonight
[2:18:18] father thank you Lord Jesus
[2:18:22] can we just raise our hands now in the
[2:18:24] presence of the
[2:18:26] Lord now he's ministered To Us by his
[2:18:29] word let us now in
[2:18:32] turn minister to him with our
[2:18:35] praise and our love and our
[2:18:39] adoration remember the prophet said that
[2:18:43] Rebecca she didn't realize that when she
[2:18:46] was packing that water down there to
[2:18:48] them
[2:18:49] camels them camels would be the very
[2:18:52] ones that would pack her to her
[2:18:55] bridegroom she went back and forth and
[2:18:57] back and forth and back and
[2:19:00] forth I think about 50 50 or 60 trips
[2:19:04] something like
[2:19:06] that the amount of gallons that each one
[2:19:08] of them camels could drink so you
[2:19:11] imagine going back and forth and back
[2:19:13] and forth and back and forth and back
[2:19:15] and forth 50 or 60 times to water them
[2:19:19] camels
[2:19:21] but boy when she rode them things back
[2:19:23] home she must have thought it was worth
[2:19:25] every trip
[2:19:26] amen Oh Glory to God you imagine all
[2:19:29] this singing and all the praying and
[2:19:31] everything that you do and whenever our
[2:19:33] change comes we'll say praise God it was
[2:19:36] worth every mou it was worth everything
[2:19:39] I ever went through what's this to be
[2:19:40] compared to what I went
[2:19:42] through oh praise the
[2:19:45] lordess Hey sing something can we just
[2:19:48] worship him a little for we go if you
[2:19:50] need to go go on but those of you that
[2:19:52] want to say let's just say for a little
[2:19:53] bit and just worship him a little let's
[2:19:56] just Minister back to him now just to
[2:19:59] let him know how we feel about him how
[2:20:02] we love him we shouldn't have to have
[2:20:04] the band you know been able to beat the
[2:20:07] drums and everything going wide open for
[2:20:09] us to be able to make love to our lord
[2:20:11] Jesus we should be able to do it from
[2:20:13] our heart it should not be us
[2:20:16] accompanying the music it should be the
[2:20:19] music and accompaniment to

[2:34:12] me what message people don't want to do
[2:34:16] it I don't cuz it's just as much a part

[2:34:21] saved you to worship him God saved you
[2:34:24] to live right God saved you to dress
[2:34:27] right yes but God saved you to clap your
