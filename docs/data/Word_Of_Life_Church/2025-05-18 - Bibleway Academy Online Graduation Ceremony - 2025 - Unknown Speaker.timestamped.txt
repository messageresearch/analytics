[26:15] That was absolutely beautiful, ladies.
[26:18] Thank you so so much for that. We want
[26:21] to now introduce you to our graduates by
[26:24] doing a little highlight of each
[26:25] graduate, uh, including an introduction,
[26:28] a little history about themselves, and
[26:29] some future plans that they have. and
[26:31] we're going to have the teachers come
[26:34] and do that while you watch the
[26:37] graduates grow up on the screen behind
[26:39] them. All right. So, I'm going to turn
[26:41] this over to Mrs. Coffee and we will
[26:44] hear about all of our
[26:47] graduates. That was
[26:51] lovely.
[26:55] Our first graduate, Mary
[26:59] Arasola, came to us from Phoenix,
[27:01] Arizona, and she attends Evening Light
[27:04] Fellowship with Brother Ron Peterson as
[27:06] her pastor. She enjoys
[27:09] photography, competitive sports, and
[27:12] traveling. Some of her favorite places
[27:14] that she has visited are the
[27:16] Philippines, New York, Hawaii, and
[27:20] Mexico.
[27:21] Mary possesses an ability to learn and
[27:24] adapt to things quickly. If she is
[27:27] interested in doing
[27:28] something, she learns to become
[27:31] proficient in that. In church, Mary
[27:34] enjoys singing specials and contributing
[27:36] to the youth choir when needed. Mary
[27:38] enjoys dogs and likes to dogsit for
[27:41] friends when they travel. Mary's family
[27:44] joined BAO three years ago and she has
[27:46] attended with her sisters ever since.
[27:48] During that time, Mary has been student
[27:51] of the month twice. She has also been
[27:53] recognized for diligence, faithful
[27:56] attendance, and
[27:57] academics. Mary is interested in the
[28:00] medical field. She is considering
[28:02] becoming a nurse, but may start by
[28:04] taking phabbotomy classes at a local
[28:06] community college. Mary is looking for a
[28:09] summer job and has her travel sites on
[28:11] Italy, Japan, and Colombia. Mary says no
[28:15] matter where her future takes her, her
[28:17] greatest prayer would be that God would
[28:19] be in the lead.
[28:53] [Applause]
[29:00] Our next student is our only uh male and
[29:04] that is Hudson Drake. Hudson was born
[29:07] and raised in the Fraser Valley of
[29:09] British Columbia, currently residing in
[29:11] Maple Ridge, BC, Canada. He has attended
[29:14] Cloverdale Bible Bible Way all his life.
[29:18] He has one younger sister and multiple
[29:20] pets, including a dog, Blossom, and a
[29:23] large extended family with 21 cousins.
[29:26] Hudson enjoys being outdoors regardless
[29:29] of the season. From swimming in the pond
[29:31] to snowball fights and everything in
[29:35] between, Hudson grew up hunting and
[29:37] fishing, as you'll see in the photos.
[29:39] He's been going on hunting trips for
[29:41] longer than he can remember.
[29:43] He successfully hunted moose and deer
[29:46] and his favorite fishing experiences
[29:48] have been sturgeon fishing or salmon
[29:51] fishing the west coast of Vancouver
[29:53] Island. For sports, hockey is where it's
[29:57] at. He's played hockey on and off since
[30:00] he was big enough to wear skates.
[30:02] Although Hudson is extremely active, he
[30:04] has no problem chilling with a good
[30:06] book. I like that. Or book series. He
[30:09] also does not miss a day of playing one
[30:11] of his guitars which include acoustic,
[30:14] classical, bass and electric or the
[30:17] piano. His skills in musical ear have
[30:20] been a tremendous blessing in his home
[30:22] as well as in church now where he plays
[30:25] guitar alongside the other musicians.
[30:28] Hudson has enjoyed taking classes
[30:30] through BAO over the last four years and
[30:33] he is thankful for the vision of those
[30:35] that inspired the school. Hudson is
[30:38] excited to be graduating this year and
[30:40] has placed a first priority after
[30:42] graduation to get a full-time job. He's
[30:46] looking into a company that places
[30:48] electrical poles where he can excavate,
[30:51] run machinery, and possibly go to work
[30:54] in northern Canada. Ultimately, however,
[30:58] Hudson is interested in training for a
[31:00] trade as an HVAC technician or a pipe
[31:03] fitter and then work up to being a
[31:05] journeyman. Eventually, Hudson would
[31:08] like to start his own
[31:11] [Applause]
[31:22] company. Love that enthusiasm. Esther
[31:26] Milan. Esther was born in South Africa
[31:29] and moved to New Zealand as an infant,
[31:31] spending a large part of her childhood
[31:33] on a small farm in the heart of the
[31:36] North Island. She took part in various
[31:38] homeschooling curriculums until 2021
[31:42] when BAO made its entrance into her
[31:44] life. Always having been the adventurous
[31:47] sort, she very much identifies as
[31:50] rightrain creative with some of her
[31:53] interests including behavioral and
[31:55] social sciences as well as literature,
[31:58] art, piano, traveling, and all things
[32:01] philosophical and poetical. She is an
[32:04] avid lover of nature and writing and
[32:06] successfully launched her first blog in
[32:09] 2024, lasting for almost a year. Her
[32:13] limited work experience consists of
[32:15] selling shoes and creating order out of
[32:18] chaos in hair and dog
[32:21] salons. Some of her hobbies include
[32:23] going for walks, drives, and watching
[32:26] Twilight Fall. She has been recognized
[32:28] with several awards while at BAO,
[32:30] including student of the month several
[32:33] times, academic achievement, the
[32:35] diligence award, faithful attendance,
[32:38] and several English awards. She has
[32:41] maintained honor role throughout her
[32:43] high school
[32:44] career. Esther plans on spending the
[32:47] latter half of 2025 on refining her
[32:50] skills in domestic engineering while
[32:53] pursuing a part-time job or starting her
[32:55] own small business in creative arts on
[32:58] the sideline. She is considering further
[33:00] study in 2026 and wishes to explore
[33:04] possibilities within the field of
[33:06] sociology andor psychology. After work
[33:10] and study for some time, she wishes to
[33:12] broaden her horizons by travel and any
[33:15] other adventure that takes her fancy
[33:18] before life no longer grants her a
[33:21] status of solitude.
[33:25] [Applause]
[33:35] Bethany Zanger. Bethany is a hardworking
[33:38] and compassionate person who values
[33:40] family responsibility and always giving
[33:43] her best. Bethy's extracurricular
[33:45] activities may not be traditional, but
[33:47] show what she values, school, work, and
[33:50] family, including helping grandparents
[33:52] on both sides of her family and the
[33:55] occasional hobby.
[33:57] These experiences have taught strength,
[33:59] patience, and the importance of being
[34:01] dependable and supportive. During her
[34:03] time in school, Bethany has been the
[34:05] student of the month multiple times and
[34:07] achieved commendation lists on both the
[34:09] 2023 and 2024 school year. Bethany feels
[34:12] strongly that life is not made up of big
[34:14] events or flashy moments, but working
[34:16] hard, staying grounded, and making quiet
[34:19] impact wherever the Lord has placed you.
[34:21] After graduation, Bethany has taken a
[34:23] gap year to explore her interest, gain
[34:26] experience, and seek clarity about the
[34:28] path God wants her to take. This summer,
[34:30] Bethany plans to continue work at her
[34:32] local dairy farm, which funds allow her
[34:34] to travel, experience new places, and
[34:36] meet new people. After her gap year,
[34:39] Bethany is interested in the medical
[34:40] field. She has already become certified
[34:42] in basic life support, and has signed up
[34:44] to work at Hershey's Children Hospital
[34:46] as a volunteer. She plans to pursue a
[34:49] degree in nursing. However, while
[34:51] nursing is her main focus, she is
[34:53] trusting God's plan and keeping an open
[34:55] heart to where he's leading
[35:13] her.
[35:33] Congratulations. Isabelle Slapa is proud
[35:36] to have completed her education through
[35:37] homeschooling beginning in kindergarten
[35:39] and continuing through her senior year.
[35:42] This approach allowed her to engage
[35:43] deeply with her studies while developing
[35:45] independence, self-discipline, and a
[35:47] strong sense of curiosity. Her academic
[35:51] interests include literature, music, and
[35:53] sciences. She also enjoys quiet,
[35:56] restorative routines such as journaling,
[35:58] walking her dog, and spending time with
[36:00] friends. Isabelle values meaningful
[36:03] dialogue and has a long-standing
[36:04] interest in cultures, travel, and global
[36:07] global perspectives. In her junior and
[36:10] senior years, Isabelle played advanced
[36:12] strings, cello, and violin with the
[36:14] National Homeschool Music Ensemble. She
[36:16] also completed competed as a setter on
[36:18] the Toledo Hornets volleyball team,
[36:21] serving as captain her senior year, an
[36:23] experience that strengthened her
[36:25] leadership and communication
[36:27] skills. Her high school experience also
[36:30] included active service in her church.
[36:32] She performed in kids days, vacation
[36:34] bible school dramas, sang in the literal
[36:36] life church choir, played bstream church
[36:39] services, taught Sunday school, and
[36:41] worked as a companionship caregiver.
[36:43] These roles provided opportunities to
[36:45] develop responsibility, public speaking,
[36:47] and mentorship
[36:49] skills. Isabelle plans to pursue a
[36:51] degree in veterinary sciences with the
[36:53] goal of becoming a veterary technician
[36:55] or veterary nurse. Her long-standing
[36:58] love for animals and commitment to
[36:59] compassionate care make this a fitting
[37:01] next step. While she holds many
[37:04] aspirations for the future, Isabelle
[37:06] remains grounded in her faith, trusting
[37:07] in God's timing and direction for her
[37:17] life.
[37:27] Congratulations,
[37:29] [Applause]

[38:31] Gracie says, "Whatever I end up doing or

[39:28] Congratulations,
[39:29] [Applause]
[39:38] Gracie. Joy Walbert. Joy was born and
[39:42] raised on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.
[39:44] She desires to live a life dedicated to
[39:46] her faithful Lord and Savior Jesus
[39:48] Christ. Faith, family, friends, and food
[39:52] are her biggest priorities. She has four
[39:54] brothers and two loving parents. Joy
[39:57] absolutely loves doing art and other
[39:59] creative activities and is passionate

[40:14] boating, gardening, hunting, and taking
[40:17] walks. She has recently discovered a
[40:19] love for skiing as well. As much as she
[40:22] loves the outdoors, however, she is
[40:24] always ready for a good tea party or
[40:26] thrift shopping adventure. Joy also
[40:28] enjoys reading, which has been her
[40:30] passion since she learned how. Joy has

[40:56] considering working towards her teaching
[40:58] degree. Her immediate goals include
[41:00] taking some time to pursue her hobbies
[41:02] while working a part-time job and
[41:03] helping at home. Joyy's ultimate life
[41:05] goal is to serve the Lord in whatever
[41:08] way he leads.
[41:10] [Applause]
[41:24] I would now like to invite to the stage
[41:27] one of our BAO graduates who was voted
[41:31] by her classmates to represent the
[41:33] graduating class as their V
[41:35] validictorian. Validictorian Esther
[41:37] Milan.
[41:45] Did you bring you want this version?
[41:51] Greetings
[41:53] everyone. Teachers, students, alumni,
[41:56] parents, supporters. Thank you for
[41:58] traveling from far and wide to celebrate
[42:00] this joyous occasion with us. We also
[42:03] want to welcome brother Donnie. I'm not
[42:05] sure where he is.
[42:08] Thank you for being here. We we're glad
[42:09] to have
[42:11] you. It is an honor to stand here before
[42:13] you today as a proud student of such an
[42:16] incredible school. And it is also a
[42:18] tremendous honor to represent our class
[42:21] of
[42:23] 2025. Get it?
[42:26] Y'all navigating online schooling
[42:28] together from the comfort of our
[42:30] individual school rooms or sofas,
[42:32] whichever one you used, has been quite
[42:34] the adventure. And it is pretty epic to
[42:37] have our journey culminate in a place
[42:39] where we're all gathered in tangible
[42:41] breathing form and not as 2D figures
[42:43] moving about in rectangular boxes on a
[42:46] Zoom
[42:48] screen. Five years ago, what started as
[42:51] a school with only nine teachers and 23
[42:53] students has grown to become a beacon of
[42:56] hope in a world where schools have long
[42:58] been falling apart.
[43:01] Not only has it given us a solid, clean
[43:03] education, but also friendships and
[43:05] connections that, God willing, will
[43:07] extend past our lifetimes and into
[43:11] eternity. Few people will ever
[43:13] experience what it's like to be in a
[43:14] school where they can look at every
[43:15] person in it and be able to say,
[43:17] "They're all my
[43:19] family." And yet, here we are
[43:21] experiencing that very thing. We're all
[43:24] from different countries and different
[43:25] backgrounds. But something much deeper
[43:27] than education binds us together and
[43:29] that is the fact that we have the same
[43:31] father. The school after all belongs to
[43:34] him and its success lies in
[43:36] that. Today there are some very special
[43:39] people who have already heard just how
[43:41] much their hard work has meant to us but
[43:42] they need to hear it again. So to the
[43:45] teachers and staff at Bible Way Academy
[43:47] Online, both here and those streaming in
[43:50] amongst the teachers of the world, you
[43:52] fall in rank with the
[43:55] elite. You have sacrificed yourself,
[43:57] your time, and your resources to provide
[44:00] us with a school that holds a barrier
[44:01] between us and the filth of the world.
[44:04] For that, we cannot thank you enough.
[44:07] You mean the world to us and we thank
[44:09] God not only for the school itself but
[44:10] also that he allowed all of you to
[44:12] become so deeply woven into each of our
[44:15] stories. To the graduates of
[44:18] 2025, we are standing at the brink of an
[44:21] unknown
[44:22] future. A new phase of life that to us
[44:24] is still
[44:25] uncertain. But in reality, it can never
[44:28] be as uncertain as it seems because
[44:29] we're only playing out on the stage of
[44:31] time. A script that God planned out long
[44:33] before the world began.
[44:36] For that reason, we can safely entrust
[44:38] our futures into the hands of the one
[44:39] who already knows it and walk forward
[44:41] without any
[44:43] fear. We were never promised that our
[44:45] lives are going to be easy. And in fact,
[44:47] it may only get harder from
[44:49] here. The older you get, the stronger
[44:51] you get, and therefore, the heavier the
[44:53] load you must carry to compensate for
[44:55] the newly acquired
[44:57] strength. We don't know how deep the
[44:59] waters are that still lie before us, or
[45:01] how fierce the storms will be. But there
[45:03] is one thing we do know, and that is
[45:05] that we can never lose or meet with
[45:06] ultimate failure if God is the one
[45:08] steering our
[45:10] ship. While some out there may tell you
[45:12] that this is your time to take your own
[45:14] first step, to conquer or change the
[45:16] world, I'm not going to tell you that
[45:18] today, for we cannot stop how rapidly
[45:19] the world is going
[45:21] down. We cannot stop or alter prophecy.
[45:24] Neither do we want to. But if you can
[45:26] shine your light in this dark world and
[45:28] be a part of changing the direction of
[45:30] travel that even one soul is
[45:32] taking from darkness to light, then
[45:35] something will have been conquered and
[45:36] changed that is worth 10,000 worlds as
[45:39] the prophet taught
[45:40] us. And of course, your own soul is of
[45:43] that same amazing
[45:45] value. You were put on this earth within
[45:47] a fleeting thing called time. But this
[45:49] is not where your life started and it's
[45:51] not where you come from. So don't let
[45:52] this world ever become your priority.
[45:57] Eternity is reality and when we cross
[45:59] over it will be like waking up from a
[46:01] dream into something more real than the
[46:03] dream ever could have
[46:05] been. I'd like to share a short story
[46:08] with you before coming to an end. One
[46:10] time there was a violinist who performed
[46:13] before a large crowd and after he
[46:14] finished playing the audience rose to
[46:16] its feet in a standing ovation for they
[46:18] were in awe at his skill. But the man in
[46:21] our story did nothing in response.
[46:24] He seemed to act strangely, and he never
[46:26] even paid attention to their cheers, for
[46:28] his eyes were focusing somewhere above
[46:32] them. Excuse me. They screamed louder
[46:35] and cheered harder, trying to get his
[46:37] attention and express their admiration.
[46:38] But still, he didn't look at them. While
[46:41] the crowd worked themselves into a
[46:43] frenzy of excitement, someone turned to
[46:45] look where the man's eyes were focused
[46:47] and saw a lone figure in the balcony.
[46:50] It was his violent
[46:52] instructor. The one who had taught him
[46:54] to play the way he had that day. The one
[46:56] who had guided and instructed him every
[46:58] step of the
[47:00] way. In that crucial moment after he
[47:02] finished playing, he did not look to
[47:04] what the audience thought of his
[47:06] performance. The only approval he needed
[47:08] and sought for was the approval of the
[47:10] man in the
[47:11] balcony. This was a story that a man
[47:13] told some years ago in a sermon. And
[47:16] after telling it, he spoke on a phrase
[47:17] that has stuck with me ever since.
[47:20] He spoke on living before the audience
[47:23] of
[47:24] one. Not living our lives to gain the
[47:26] approval of others, but the approval of
[47:28] one person,
[47:30] God. You will meet with both the
[47:33] pleasure and displeasure of many people.
[47:35] You'll need to face criticism and
[47:37] potentially hatred from those who do not
[47:39] walk the same path you were destined to.
[47:41] But never, ever let the approval or
[47:43] disapproval of others divert your eyes
[47:46] from the one whose approval truly
[47:47] matters.
[47:50] Keep your eyes on our captain as you
[47:51] walk through life. Not only when the
[47:53] storms come, but perhaps most important
[47:55] of all, when you have smooth
[47:57] sailing. It's the only way your life
[47:59] will ever amount to anything is if you
[48:01] keep your eyes on him. Live your life
[48:03] before the audience of
[48:05] one. That is, after all, why we're here.
[48:08] As mentioned earlier, this life is only
[48:10] a fleeting shadow that will nearly
[48:11] disappear in the light of eternity.
[48:14] And as we reach this important milestone
[48:16] in our lives, it is so easy to want to
[48:18] focus only on the immediate issues that
[48:20] lie before us that come with living in a
[48:22] timebound world. But right now, the best
[48:25] thing I can tell
[48:27] you is to remember why you're here,
[48:29] where you've come from, and where you're
[48:32] going. If you place your focus on the
[48:35] finish line, then you'll be able to live
[48:36] this life to its fullest. Because a life
[48:39] lived to its fullest is a life lived for
[48:41] Christ.
[48:43] As I end this, some of us may never see
[48:45] one another again when this weekend is
[48:47] over. We will go back to our walks of
[48:49] life in various different states and
[48:51] countries, but remember that we have the
[48:53] same captain, and we're in this
[48:55] together. As the saying goes, we may be
[48:58] miles apart, but will always be
[48:59] connected by the heart. And of course,
[49:02] in our case, we will also remain
[49:03] connected because of this wonderful
[49:05] thing we have in common called Bible Way
[49:07] Academy Online.
[49:09] It is time for us to set sail into the
[49:12] great unknown. But let us go out to meet
[49:13] it with courage and confidence because
[49:15] we're on the winning side and we know
[49:17] who holds tomorrow. Thank you and God
[49:19] bless
[49:36] you. Thank you, Esther.
[49:40] We would now like to ask the members of
[49:42] the BAO choir to come forward and
[49:44] prepare for their song this
[49:46] evening. So go ahead and start um
[49:50] gathering up
[49:52] front. This is our first ever BAO
[49:58] choir. Although I hope it won't be the
[50:01] last. Having a BAOO school choir is
[50:04] something that I have thought about,
[50:06] talked about, even tried to do several
[50:09] times. But as you can imagine, it's
[50:11] difficult to do a choir with an online
[50:14] school, especially when your musicians
[50:16] are not also the tech gurus of the
[50:19] group. So, I am very, very thankful for
[50:23] this Lacta family and for brother Kenny
[50:26] who took the challenge of leading this
[50:29] online group starting out virtually and
[50:32] then making final adjustments when
[50:34] everybody arrived here in Tennessee.
[50:36] Brother Kenny has much experience with
[50:38] choirs both uh in person and virtual.
[50:41] So, you can imagine my relief when he
[50:43] said he would take the group this
[50:45] evening. They
[50:49] have
[50:50] prepared I think a a a medley we'll say
[50:55] a uh directed by brother Kenny and um I
[51:00] heard them last night. They sound so
[51:02] good. You guys are awesome.
[51:10] [Music]
[51:13] Change.
[51:16] [Music]
[51:38] May the
[51:40] road rise to meet
[51:45] you. May the wind be always at your
[51:50] back.
[51:53] May the
[51:55] sun
[51:59] shine upon your
[52:03] [Music]
[52:06] way. May the
[52:11] rainbow
[52:13] soft upon your feet.
[52:17] [Laughter]
[52:22] and until we meet
[52:26] again. May he hold you in his hand.
[52:32] [Music]
[52:34] May God hold
[52:38] you in the
[52:50] world.
[52:53] Heat.
[53:03] Heat. Yeah.
[53:13] Heat.
[53:17] Yeah.
[53:27] Heat.
[53:32] Yeah. Heat.
[53:39] [Music]
[53:46] [Music]
[53:47] May God hold
[53:51] you in the
[53:54] b of his hands.
[54:01] [Music]
[54:05] The Lord bless
[54:09] you and keep
[54:13] you. May his face shine upon you and be
[54:19] gracious to you. The Lord turn
[54:25] his face toward
[54:29] you and give you peace.
[54:34] [Music]
[54:37] Lord bless
[54:41] you and keep
[54:44] you. Make his face shine upon you.
[55:03] A Hey,
[55:14] A
[55:40] God bless
[55:43] you and keep
[55:57] you.
[55:58] Heat. Heat.
[56:31] Heat. Heat.
[56:46] Heat.
[56:50] [Music]
[56:55] Heat.
[57:05] Heat. Heat.
[57:14] [Music]
[57:15] [Applause]
[57:16] [Music]
[57:16] [Applause]
[57:19] [Music]
[57:22] [Applause]
[57:23] [Music]
[57:24] [Applause]
[57:38] That was beautiful. Thank you all so
[57:41] much. Brother Kenny, thank
[57:43] you. That was amazing.
[57:46] We have a special commencement speaker
[57:49] for you this evening. Somebody that I
[57:51] have great respect and admiration for
[57:54] and I will say if you've never heard his
[57:56] testimony, you should. Uh in addition to
[58:00] that, I've always enjoyed hearing him
[58:02] speak, I find him extremely insightful,
[58:05] very real, applicable, and so much so
[58:09] that it just always amazes me every time
[58:11] I I hear from our speaker. I would
[58:15] encourage the graduating class to listen
[58:17] carefully and closely to what he has to
[58:19] say this evening and to find wisdom in
[58:21] that
[58:22] simplicity. Um, we have to speak for us
[58:25] this evening all the way from British
[58:27] Columbia, Canada, Brother Kyle Morton.
[58:37] Do you want me to move this? You mind?
[58:39] Would you mind? Okay.
[58:44] Good evening
[58:46] everybody. You know, it's such an honor
[58:48] to be here. We've been saying, you know,
[58:51] it's it's so special to be here, but
[58:53] while we were hiking today, uh Mount
[58:55] Ran, Brother Michael, you should have
[58:56] seen it. Uh while we're hiking Mount
[58:58] Ran, I was thinking it's it's not just
[59:00] special to be here. It's it's somewhere
[59:02] between special and
[59:03] sublime. And uh we'll be able to look
[59:06] back on this weekend and think and mine
[59:08] more and more of the good things we're
[59:09] able to uh partake in this weekend. And
[59:12] so with that, I want to say again thanks
[59:13] to the word of life, brother Donnister
[59:14] Carol for helping facilitate this. And
[59:17] thank you to all the staff. I know it's
[59:19] been said already, but and even the
[59:21] family of the staff. I see your parents
[59:23] are around hustling around other family
[59:24] members and all the parents and all the
[59:26] young people that are a part of this uh
[59:29] BAO community. My daughter's been doing
[59:30] it for three years now, right Sarah? And
[59:34] uh we just love it and so appreciate it.
[59:36] It's uh humbling to be asked to speak.
[59:38] We as soon as we heard about this, it
[59:40] wanted to come. And then one time, I
[59:42] think I was driving in my dump truck at
[59:44] work and a thought began to come to me.
[59:45] And I always keep a journal beside me on
[59:48] my where I'm working. I just wrote the
[59:49] thought down. I thought that's
[59:50] interesting. That sounds kind of like a
[59:51] grad thought, but just put it aside for
[59:53] now. I keep driving dump truck. And then
[59:55] Sister Jenny contacted me and I said, I
[59:58] I'd be honored, but if somebody else
[59:59] comes and you want them, I'm okay to sub
[1:00:01] out. And so when I come here this
[1:00:03] weekend, I see the different ones
[1:00:04] gathering. I think, you know, there's
[1:00:06] many other more qualified people who
[1:00:07] could speak with more wisdom and
[1:00:08] experience, but I'm I'm humbled and
[1:00:10] honored to be able to say something to
[1:00:11] you. Originally, if you don't know me, I
[1:00:14] came from Cloverdale Bible Way. My wife
[1:00:16] was born and raised there. I started
[1:00:17] attending there in 2004. So, I come from
[1:00:19] where the brickandmortar Bible Way
[1:00:21] Christian Academy School is. I helped
[1:00:23] build the new building. And I'm probably
[1:00:25] one of the only people that had uh one
[1:00:27] of the devotions they spoke uh stopped
[1:00:29] halfway by the principal. I was speaking
[1:00:32] about um Ephesians 6 about um taking the
[1:00:36] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[1:00:38] God praying and I was combining that
[1:00:40] with brother Bram saying even the
[1:00:41] weakest Christian on their knees makes
[1:00:43] the devil tremble and I had some young
[1:00:45] kids come up with a real sword and I see
[1:00:47] look even these young kids swinging the
[1:00:49] real sword they can do damage and I was
[1:00:51] just I was so into these young boys
[1:00:52] swinging this real metal sword and I
[1:00:54] didn't see my wife waving in the back
[1:00:56] for me to stop and the principal came up
[1:00:58] and grabbed the sword from the kids cuz
[1:01:00] it was so dangerous. and I just felt
[1:01:02] like I'd come out of a dream. But so
[1:01:04] that's probably the only devotion that's
[1:01:06] been stopped halfway. But always honored
[1:01:08] to speak to young people and uh
[1:01:10] hopefully I can speak something this
[1:01:12] evening that you can grasp. I know
[1:01:14] there's so much emotion and things going
[1:01:16] on and even if you're not a grad, I hope
[1:01:17] I can speak something this evening
[1:01:18] that'll be a blessing um to you as well.
[1:01:22] And is that okay? Won't be long. So I'm
[1:01:24] just going to read a scripture to start
[1:01:26] with out of the book of Isaiah. Sorry,
[1:01:28] book of Psalms. Isaiah
[1:01:30] later, but the book of uh Psalms chapter
[1:01:33] 5 says, "My soul wait thou only upon
[1:01:36] God, for my expectation is from him. He
[1:01:39] only is my rock and my salvation. He is
[1:01:42] my defense. I shall not be moved. In God
[1:01:44] is my salvation and my glory. The rock
[1:01:46] of my strength and my refuge is in God.
[1:01:49] Trust in him at all times, ye people.
[1:01:52] Pour out your heart before him. God is a
[1:01:54] refuge for us. Salah. Surely men of low
[1:01:57] degree are vanity, and men of high
[1:01:59] degree are a lie to be laid in the
[1:02:02] balance. They are altogether lighter
[1:02:03] than vanity. Trust not in oppression,
[1:02:06] and become not vain in robbery. If
[1:02:08] riches increase, set not your heart upon
[1:02:11] them. That's actually the portion I want
[1:02:12] to major on this evening. I know it's
[1:02:14] kind of
[1:02:14] odd, but if riches increase, set not
[1:02:18] your heart upon them. God hath spoken
[1:02:20] once, twice have I heard this, that
[1:02:22] power belongth unto God. also unto thee,
[1:02:25] oh Lord, belongth mercy, for thou
[1:02:27] renderest to every man according to his
[1:02:29] work. Do you mind if we have a small
[1:02:30] word of short word of prayer? Heavenly
[1:02:33] Father, again, we're just so honored to
[1:02:34] be gathered here. I just pray you'd help
[1:02:36] me in this commencement speech as
[1:02:38] they're graduating. They're also
[1:02:39] beginning. So Lord, may you just speak
[1:02:41] something from your word. Help me in my
[1:02:43] simple way. And may you touch our
[1:02:45] hearts. Help us go forward from this
[1:02:46] weekend able to walk with you in a
[1:02:48] greater way. We thank you for your
[1:02:49] kindness to us, Lord. We commit this
[1:02:51] evening again to you in Jesus name.
[1:02:54] Amen. Amen.
[1:02:57] So the thought that came to me was in my
[1:02:59] dump truck is that I want to speak to
[1:03:00] you about gauging your interests or
[1:03:04] monitoring measuring your interest. What
[1:03:06] are you interested in to pay attention
[1:03:08] to that? That's what I want to speak on.
[1:03:09] This is something that I wish this is
[1:03:12] one of the things I wish someone talked
[1:03:14] to me about walked around a pond with me
[1:03:16] took me out for coffee and just said
[1:03:18] what are you interested in and how much
[1:03:20] are you partaking in those things in
[1:03:23] which you're interested in. So to be
[1:03:25] interested means a feeling of wanting to
[1:03:28] learn more about something or to be
[1:03:31] involved in something. All right. So if
[1:03:33] you're interested, you have a feeling of
[1:03:34] wanting to learn more about something or
[1:03:37] you want to be involved in something.
[1:03:40] There's one quote the very end of the
[1:03:42] church age book. Brother Renham says,
[1:03:44] "Not for one moment do I bring a message
[1:03:46] to people that they may follow me or
[1:03:48] join my church or start some fellowship
[1:03:51] and organization. I have never done that
[1:03:53] and will not do that now. I have no
[1:03:57] interest in those things, but I do have
[1:03:59] an interest in the things of God and
[1:04:02] people. All right? So, brother Brennham,
[1:04:04] the messenger says he has an interest in
[1:04:06] the things of God and people. And if I
[1:04:09] can accomplish this one thing, I'll be
[1:04:11] satisfied. That one thing is to see
[1:04:13] established a true spiritual
[1:04:15] relationship between God and men,
[1:04:17] wherein men become become new creations
[1:04:19] in Christ, filled with his spirit, and
[1:04:21] live according to his word. I would
[1:04:23] invite, plead and warn all to hear his
[1:04:25] voice at this time and yield our lives
[1:04:28] complete to him even as I trust in my
[1:04:30] heart that I have given my all to him.
[1:04:33] God bless you and may his coming rejoice
[1:04:35] your heart. So there we have a little
[1:04:37] window into what was the prophet's
[1:04:39] interest. So we all have interest. Is
[1:04:41] this true? Everybody has interest. I'm
[1:04:43] not sure if you've thought about this
[1:04:44] that much, but what we're interested in,
[1:04:46] it affects how we think. It affects how
[1:04:49] we act. It affects how we spend our time
[1:04:51] and our energy. Just look at us this
[1:04:54] weekend. Some of us came from New
[1:04:55] Zealand, Canada, Delaware, Arizona, down
[1:04:59] the road, right? We came here because we
[1:05:01] have an interest in the Lord. We have an
[1:05:04] interest in the message. We have an
[1:05:05] interest in our children. We didn't come
[1:05:07] here just on a whim. This wasn't just us
[1:05:09] sitting at home. Do you want to go for a
[1:05:11] hamburger or not? Right? This is coming
[1:05:13] across the country putting great energy.
[1:05:15] And because we love the Lord and we love
[1:05:18] our children, we have an interest in the
[1:05:19] things of God and people. Amen.
[1:05:23] So, we need to be mindful of what are we
[1:05:27] interested in because they're going to
[1:05:28] shape how we think, how we act, how we
[1:05:29] spend our time, and how we spend our
[1:05:32] energy. And where do these interests
[1:05:34] come from? It's a big subject for me
[1:05:37] partly. I would sum it up saying your
[1:05:39] interests come from your nature partly
[1:05:41] and how you're nurtured and also God's
[1:05:43] divine plan. All right. So, we all have
[1:05:45] a different nature, a different makeup.
[1:05:47] We're all humans, so we're all generally
[1:05:49] interested in human things, right? We're
[1:05:51] not monkeys or rhinoceroses. We're not,
[1:05:53] you know, pursuing their interest
[1:05:55] necessarily, right? And so, the the
[1:05:58] older you get, maybe you're you're
[1:06:01] bridging off or launching off in this
[1:06:03] portion of your life and you're thinking
[1:06:04] to yourself, you know, I'm I'm going to
[1:06:06] become, you know, who I'm meant to be or
[1:06:08] something like that. But when you get
[1:06:09] into your 30s, you'll realize more and
[1:06:11] more you're a whole lot like your
[1:06:12] parents. you'll realize you'll be
[1:06:14] sitting down like them. If they're doing
[1:06:16] this, you'll be doing this also. If they
[1:06:19] stir their coffee a certain way, you'll
[1:06:21] probably stir your coffee that way also.
[1:06:23] So, our nature is very power uh
[1:06:25] powerful. All right? How we're nurtured,
[1:06:28] what we're exposed to is very powerful.
[1:06:31] The influences that are around us. Uh
[1:06:33] there's another scripture I wanted to
[1:06:35] read to you if I have it here. Speaking
[1:06:38] of nature, nurture, and divinity, it's
[1:06:40] in Isaiah 43.
[1:06:42] says, "But now thus sayeth the Lord that
[1:06:45] created thee, oh Jacob, and he that
[1:06:48] formed thee, O Israel, fear not, for I
[1:06:51] have redeemed thee, I have called thee
[1:06:53] by thy name, thou are mine." So God made
[1:06:57] Jacob, right? But he was also forming
[1:07:00] him and redeeming him. So we've been
[1:07:03] created a certain way. And I know
[1:07:05] sometimes people struggle with how God
[1:07:06] made them, but I believe God put a lot
[1:07:08] of care into all of you. All right? And
[1:07:11] I think sometimes we think, you know, oh
[1:07:12] wretched man that I am, but we're also a
[1:07:14] temple of the Holy Ghost. All right? And
[1:07:17] so God made you special. And I think we
[1:07:18] should, some people, they have a hard
[1:07:20] time with how their nose looks. That's
[1:07:22] the nose God gave you. It's like, praise
[1:07:24] the Lord. Amen.
[1:07:27] Some God puts so much effort into how we
[1:07:31] ting the sound that our bell and our
[1:07:33] live makes, especially if we're yielding
[1:07:35] our lives to him, the sound that can
[1:07:37] come forth from our lives. And so it's
[1:07:40] important for us to be aware of this and
[1:07:41] how we're nurtured. Jacob was nurtured
[1:07:43] in a very unique way. Maybe he was kind
[1:07:45] of neglected by his father and kind of
[1:07:47] smothered by his mother, right? But this
[1:07:49] played a role in who he was to become as
[1:07:53] God had a plan for his life, not only to
[1:07:55] wrestle with an angel in the cave, but
[1:07:57] other different things as well. And so
[1:08:00] we are progressing and we are growing.
[1:08:02] And as we grow, our interests begin to
[1:08:04] change. All right, I'm going to start
[1:08:06] moving towards a car analogy. speaking
[1:08:08] about gauging your interest. Think about
[1:08:10] a car. You pay attention to the gauge in
[1:08:12] front of you. But you when you were
[1:08:14] young, you didn't pay attention to those
[1:08:16] gauges. All right? You were in the back
[1:08:18] seat maybe chewing on Sophie the
[1:08:21] giraffe, right? Did anybody have Sophie
[1:08:23] the giraffe? A few of you. Okay. And
[1:08:26] then maybe after you're done chewing
[1:08:28] Sophie the giraffe, then you're singing
[1:08:30] along to Steve Green. Hide him in your
[1:08:32] heart. Then you progress from there.
[1:08:34] Maybe you're listening to some
[1:08:35] Adventures in Odyssey.
[1:08:38] Next thing you know, you're in the
[1:08:39] steering wheel. Now, it's very important
[1:08:41] for you to pay attention to the gauge.
[1:08:44] All right? To pay attention to your
[1:08:45] speed, pay attention to the oil, because
[1:08:48] if you don't, you're going to be in
[1:08:49] trouble. Or you might all of a sudden
[1:08:51] see a state trooper coming up behind
[1:08:53] you. All right? So it's important for us
[1:08:56] if we monitor those gauges that God has
[1:08:58] before us, we can move more into being a
[1:09:00] blessing and our life being positive and
[1:09:03] our life being a plus, not always being
[1:09:05] on the side of the road crashed up or
[1:09:08] with red and blue lights behind us. All
[1:09:10] right? So we are moving more into
[1:09:14] sitting behind the wheel and God's the
[1:09:16] unseen hand behind it all. But our
[1:09:19] choices matter as we grow up more and
[1:09:22] more. What are we interested in? Are we
[1:09:24] paying attention to those things? All
[1:09:27] right. Is that
[1:09:30] okay? So, literally and metaphorically,
[1:09:33] we are moving more and more into the
[1:09:35] driver's seat. And we need to pay
[1:09:38] attention to what are we interested in,
[1:09:40] but not only what, but how much. There's
[1:09:43] a sweet spot. Just like when you're
[1:09:45] pressing the gas. Do all of you have
[1:09:46] driver's licenses? I see u 50/50
[1:09:50] maybe. Who has a driver's license?
[1:09:53] Okay, four out of five.
[1:09:55] No, six out of seven have driver's
[1:09:57] license. Okay, so this is very
[1:09:59] important. There's a sweet spot even
[1:10:01] with the gas pedal. If you overrev it,
[1:10:04] you can blow the engine up and if you
[1:10:07] don't press it at all, you're not going
[1:10:08] to go nowhere. All right, so there's a
[1:10:10] sweet spot to pay and if you drive
[1:10:12] standard, you can stall it. I hope you
[1:10:14] all learn to drive standard. It's a
[1:10:16] wonderful thing. I learned on a on a
[1:10:19] Jeep YJ going through four-way stops
[1:10:21] like
[1:10:23] this because I couldn't find that sweet
[1:10:26] spot. So, if you're going to learn,
[1:10:28] learn on a small car like a Pontiac
[1:10:30] Firefly. All right? Not a Jeep
[1:10:35] YJ. So, as you're growing, as you're
[1:10:38] progressing, your interests are going to
[1:10:40] change. And it's important that you pay
[1:10:42] attention to those things. I I hope your
[1:10:43] interests change. I was at my
[1:10:45] brother-in-law's house and my nephew was
[1:10:47] there. He's 2 years old. And he grabbed
[1:10:49] my finger and he led me over to his toy
[1:10:51] trains and he pointed for me to sit down
[1:10:53] and play with his toy trains. Now, I
[1:10:56] have no interest in toy trains anymore.
[1:10:58] But he does. He's 2 years old. I took an
[1:11:00] interest cuz he's interested in them.
[1:11:01] But if you came over to my house and I'm
[1:11:03] still playing with toy
[1:11:04] trains, it'd be a bit odd. But if you
[1:11:08] like them, that's fine.
[1:11:10] But as we grow and progress, hopefully
[1:11:12] our interests change. I mean the magnets
[1:11:14] are amazing when you face them the
[1:11:16] opposite direction and they they
[1:11:20] push. So as we more come into the age of
[1:11:24] accountability I hope that our prime
[1:11:26] I'll take our interest and break them
[1:11:28] down into primary and secondary. Our
[1:11:30] hope our primary interest is to love the
[1:11:32] Lord thy God with all our heart, all our
[1:11:34] mind and all our soul and all our
[1:11:36] strength. Jesus said that's the greatest
[1:11:38] commandment. All the law and prophets
[1:11:40] hangs on these things. So, I I hope
[1:11:42] that's our primary interest. I hope
[1:11:43] that's your primary interest, grads. I
[1:11:46] hope it's not just like a performative
[1:11:48] primary interest. Like, if you're going
[1:11:49] to play sports, you put on a jersey and
[1:11:51] you you perform for a little while, but
[1:11:53] then you take it off, you're not playing
[1:11:55] anymore. I hope it's not just a
[1:11:57] performative thing that we It's church
[1:11:59] time. This is how we act. This is how we
[1:12:02] sing. I hope it's something when you're
[1:12:03] lying down, when you're rising up, when
[1:12:05] you're walking along the way, like
[1:12:06] Deuteronomy 6 says, I hope you're
[1:12:08] thinking about the Lord. I hope you love
[1:12:10] him. Amen. we whether you feel his
[1:12:12] presence or not. When I was young, I
[1:12:15] always wanted to feel the presence of
[1:12:16] the Lord and have some supernatural
[1:12:18] experience and see an angel or something
[1:12:20] like that. And the other day, I was just
[1:12:22] walking my dog by the Fraser River and I
[1:12:24] felt nothing and I felt totally content
[1:12:26] in the Lord. Whether a high experience
[1:12:28] or not, I loved the Lord. Amen. With my
[1:12:31] yellow lab walking by the river. It was
[1:12:33] wonderful. So, primary, I hope that you
[1:12:35] love the Lord. Amen. I hope it's real.
[1:12:39] And if it's not, you can ask them. Amen.
[1:12:42] Just find yourself on your knees one
[1:12:43] time in your bedroom and say, "Lord,
[1:12:44] would you make yourself real to me? I
[1:12:46] want to. It seems like it's so
[1:12:47] important. I'm around people. I'm
[1:12:48] exposed. I'm by these people who love
[1:12:50] the Lord." Brother Barry, Sir Becky,
[1:12:52] different ones, Brother Donnie. Lord,
[1:12:54] make it real to me. I don't want to
[1:12:55] pretend.
[1:12:56] Amen. And then then that should dictate
[1:12:59] our secondary
[1:13:00] interests, right? Maybe you're a sister
[1:13:04] and you love the Lord. There should be
[1:13:05] an interest maybe to to be
[1:13:07] ladylike, right? Like look at some of
[1:13:10] these examples
[1:13:12] here. To be ladylike. I so appreciate
[1:13:14] them. Amen. Their influence on my
[1:13:16] daughter. Maybe there's an interest in
[1:13:18] children. That's a good thing. Maybe
[1:13:20] there's an interest in in in cooking and
[1:13:22] domestic things and relationship and
[1:13:24] finances as Psalm 62. I was reading
[1:13:27] about that. And if you're a brother, I
[1:13:29] hope you love the Lord and you have an
[1:13:31] interest in being humble, being a
[1:13:33] servant. Amen. Working. Learning how to
[1:13:36] wake up to an alarm clock. All right. If
[1:13:39] the job starts at seven, be there
[1:13:41] before. My grade seven teacher and
[1:13:44] basketball coach was a famous ukulele
[1:13:46] teacher, Peter Lango. And he had some
[1:13:49] saying, "If you're early, you're on
[1:13:52] time. If you're on time, you're late. If
[1:13:53] you're late, you're dead." And that that
[1:13:55] always stuck with me. Was such a form
[1:13:57] formative grade seven
[1:13:59] teacher. He am I going too long? Okay.
[1:14:02] Sorry.
[1:14:04] These are such formative years. I feel
[1:14:06] part of part of me like I'm always in
[1:14:08] grade seven. Part of me those it was
[1:14:10] such a formative time of my life. Um he
[1:14:13] said we did a career day. It's like okay
[1:14:15] pick a job you'll make this much and
[1:14:19] then with this much you can afford these
[1:14:21] cars and you can afford these kind of
[1:14:22] houses and you put them on a poster
[1:14:24] before you. And that's what we did in
[1:14:25] grade seven. I want to be a teacher.
[1:14:27] This is how much I'll make. This is the
[1:14:29] Pontiac Firefly I'm going to get.
[1:14:32] this this is the apartment I'm going to
[1:14:34] live in, you know, and that that's where
[1:14:35] I was going because I I was going that
[1:14:38] direction before I knew the Lord, which
[1:14:39] is it's a fine direction to go, but I
[1:14:41] ended up being a gardener. It's it's
[1:14:42] odd, but the Lord knows. But even at a
[1:14:46] young age, you can make decisions that
[1:14:47] are going to set the trajectory of the
[1:14:49] next 10, 20 years of your life. All
[1:14:51] right? So, even then, my interests were
[1:14:53] being shaped. I was in grade seven,
[1:14:55] grade 8, grade nine, grade 12.
[1:14:56] Hopefully, you know, you're not just
[1:14:58] chasing seagulls around and so forth.
[1:15:00] your interests change in how you view
[1:15:02] how brothers view sisters, how sisters
[1:15:04] view brothers. And there's a way to
[1:15:07] steward those interests properly to
[1:15:09] maintain a good testimony to a avoid
[1:15:11] certain scars, to avoid certain trauma
[1:15:14] and wounds that you're going to need
[1:15:15] healing from. Amen. So hopefully we have
[1:15:18] a primary interest. We can gauge that.
[1:15:21] What are you thinking about when you're
[1:15:22] walking, when you're lying, when you're
[1:15:24] rising up? Are you thinking about the
[1:15:26] Lord? It's a good sign you're following
[1:15:28] the shama. you you're hearing. Amen.
[1:15:31] Here, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one.
[1:15:32] Thou shalt love him with all thy heart,
[1:15:34] mind, soul, and strength. And that
[1:15:35] should dictate our secondary
[1:15:38] interests and help govern and guide
[1:15:41] those things. And all of us are going to
[1:15:44] have little other interests that we
[1:15:45] like, right? I I I like Rice Krispies a
[1:15:49] lot. I make sure they're all soggy
[1:15:51] before I eat them. And when I meet
[1:15:53] someone else like that, it's like my
[1:15:54] brother. All right? I like playing a bit
[1:15:57] of sports and basketball. I like being
[1:15:59] quiet out in nature. Some like hunting.
[1:16:01] All right. But all these things need to
[1:16:03] be governed. There's a sweet spot where
[1:16:05] we can overdo something sometimes,
[1:16:07] right? If I was thinking about Rice
[1:16:09] Krispies all the time, I'd be crazy.
[1:16:11] Some are thinking about hunting all the
[1:16:13] time or sports all the time. And I think
[1:16:14] we need to rev that down a little bit.
[1:16:16] Amen. Let's think about the Lord.
[1:16:18] Hallelujah. I want to go down the road
[1:16:21] smooth, not swerving and dangerous and
[1:16:24] woo, I made it. That was, you know, from
[1:16:27] here, I want to be able to govern my
[1:16:30] life as safe as possible. There's going
[1:16:31] to be trials. There'll be bumps. There's
[1:16:33] things you can't avoid. But Lord,
[1:16:35] there's things I can do to help prevent
[1:16:38] a certain amount of damage and calamity
[1:16:40] in my life. Right? If you're driving
[1:16:43] with your eyes closed, probabilities
[1:16:45] high it's going to go bad. So the
[1:16:47] probability is higher of living a more
[1:16:49] blessing life if you live your life
[1:16:51] according to the word of God. And pay
[1:16:53] attention to your interests. All right?
[1:16:56] Gauge these things. Monitor them just
[1:16:59] like you would monitor your vehicle when
[1:17:01] you're driving. And some of us are going
[1:17:03] to have unique interests. They're
[1:17:04] different. Some of you will be more
[1:17:05] artistic. Like brother Stephie, brother
[1:17:07] Ram talks about this painting that he
[1:17:09] had from brother Stephy and he said, "I
[1:17:10] wish I could send this boy to school to
[1:17:12] develop this gift." Some are different.
[1:17:15] Sometimes, you know, I have this I have
[1:17:17] this bad uh saying about myself. My
[1:17:21] inspiration overrules all. It's like if
[1:17:23] I'm inspired about something, I'm going
[1:17:24] to beat you over the head until we do my
[1:17:26] thing. All right. But some people are
[1:17:28] different. As I get older, I realize
[1:17:29] people are different. They have
[1:17:30] different interests. Some people, they
[1:17:31] have an interest in planes or horses or
[1:17:34] even just babies and helping people. And
[1:17:35] that's wonderful. It's how God made you.
[1:17:38] Maybe that's his calling for your life.
[1:17:39] So, let's try and find that sweet spot.
[1:17:42] And as you get older, all of you
[1:17:44] probably have a wallet, right? That's
[1:17:46] what why I read that scripture out of
[1:17:47] Psalm 62. Brother Barry could do a much
[1:17:49] better job about finances. I listened to
[1:17:51] a winter youth retreat. When I was
[1:17:53] single, I was just in the word all the
[1:17:55] time like a monk. I would get recordings
[1:17:57] from Michigan youth camp. He was talking
[1:17:59] about interest rates and you need to be
[1:18:01] aware of Visa interest rates and how
[1:18:03] they offer you a laptop, but by the end
[1:18:05] of it, you're paying five times the
[1:18:07] price of the laptop. And he said, "Enjoy
[1:18:08] your laptop." on the
[1:18:12] recording, right? So, we need to be
[1:18:14] aware as you grow older of finances and
[1:18:16] some of you, you might serve the Lord
[1:18:18] and do well, but don't set your heart
[1:18:20] upon the riches. Have that sweet spot.
[1:18:21] Have that governance, right? You don't
[1:18:24] want to be consumed by money and
[1:18:25] consumed by the ability to possess
[1:18:28] certain things. The scripture often
[1:18:30] gives us boundaries on both sides. The
[1:18:33] love of money can be the root of all
[1:18:34] evil. But it also speaks about paying
[1:18:36] taxes and making friends with people who
[1:18:39] have that mammon of the unrighteousness.
[1:18:42] The Bible says in Luke chapter 16. So in
[1:18:45] these interest, these secondary
[1:18:46] interests, there's some kind of sweet
[1:18:48] spot that we got to be able to find. And
[1:18:50] the word and the message helps us find
[1:18:52] that sweet spot. All right? So we don't
[1:18:55] blow up and so that we don't just stall
[1:18:57] or do nothing on the side of the road.
[1:18:59] Hallelujah.
[1:19:02] And so I I challenge you young people. I
[1:19:04] know you're I love the photos. I love
[1:19:06] the outfits. I love the slideshow. I
[1:19:08] think, man, what amazing young people.
[1:19:10] What potential that you've already done
[1:19:13] something with that potential. Learning
[1:19:16] to write. What a critical thing. That's
[1:19:19] partly learning to think. I graduated in
[1:19:22] honors and I didn't know what a noun or
[1:19:24] a verb was. Isn't that
[1:19:27] awful? That's awful. My first college
[1:19:30] paper my professor wrote this is not a
[1:19:32] college level essay. I thought what am I
[1:19:34] going to do this all I
[1:19:36] know even recent last five years I've
[1:19:38] had to teach myself the difference
[1:19:39] between there and there two and two
[1:19:44] right but graduated with honors because
[1:19:46] they passed me along and so forth but
[1:19:48] you I I watch my daughter and what she's
[1:19:50] learning in English it's it's it's such
[1:19:52] higher level than I know even now.
[1:19:54] Praise the Lord. I'm thankful for BAO.
[1:19:57] Real standards. Amen. Real
[1:20:01] [Laughter]
[1:20:03] academics.
[1:20:05] Oh, praise the Lord. Water
[1:20:08] break. Amen. Real
[1:20:12] standards. Make sure you don't set your
[1:20:14] standards with just with the world,
[1:20:16] right? Real standards. Push yourself in
[1:20:20] these things. Push yourself a little
[1:20:21] bit. be uncomfortable a little bit as
[1:20:23] you pursue these interests, these
[1:20:25] curiosities that God put in your heart.
[1:20:27] Pursue them. I would so I would
[1:20:29] challenge you when this weekend's over,
[1:20:31] sit down, write down what are the top 10
[1:20:34] things you're interested in. Top
[1:20:37] 10. Write them down. What are they? I'm
[1:20:41] interested in
[1:20:42] writing. You say, I love the
[1:20:45] Lord, children, or whatever. I love
[1:20:48] kids. I love nature. Write these things
[1:20:50] down. These are my top 10 interests.
[1:20:53] Now, it might change as you get older.
[1:20:55] Your interests can change. Even as I get
[1:20:57] older, my interests change as my I have
[1:21:00] two wonderful kids. My my daughter,
[1:21:01] praise the Lord, start crying, won a
[1:21:03] leadership award. But as they get older,
[1:21:05] I watch them try and become ladies and
[1:21:06] gentlemen. I take more of an interest in
[1:21:08] things like
[1:21:10] manners, right? An interest in manners.
[1:21:12] Brother talks about a water pump
[1:21:14] handshake, a real handshake, right?
[1:21:17] Look, we need to have an interest in
[1:21:18] looking a brother or sister in the eye
[1:21:20] when they shake your hand. Amen. I So
[1:21:23] I'm take that's more of an interest now
[1:21:25] as my children grow. When I was 22, I
[1:21:28] wasn't thinking about
[1:21:30] that. But write down your top 10
[1:21:33] interests. All right? And then think,
[1:21:36] how much time am I spending these
[1:21:37] things? This thing might not there might
[1:21:39] be no scripture against this interest,
[1:21:41] but am I doing it too much? Am I
[1:21:43] thinking about this when I lie down?
[1:21:44] when I when I when I rise up, when I
[1:21:47] walk by the way, am I writing these
[1:21:49] things upon my my hands and my eyelids?
[1:21:51] Maybe I need to rev that down,
[1:21:54] right? Write those things down and maybe
[1:21:56] go over them with a
[1:21:58] friend. Some of us live far away, but
[1:22:00] you can connect on WhatsApp. You can
[1:22:01] connect on Zoom and have coffee. And
[1:22:03] what are your 10 interests? Oh, these
[1:22:04] are mine. Or maybe with a mentor. God
[1:22:07] bless all your parents. All the mentors.
[1:22:09] Hallelujah. Our children don't have to
[1:22:12] reinvent the wheel by themselves. I've
[1:22:14] had some wonderful ones in my life and
[1:22:17] brother Michael's dad's one of them and
[1:22:18] so forth and going to start pulling on
[1:22:20] brother Barry a bit more too
[1:22:22] these but I these are important because
[1:22:25] I want you to be a blessing. I want you
[1:22:26] to be a plus wherever you go. You know
[1:22:29] we were flying here on an airplane and
[1:22:31] you just watch people come down the
[1:22:32] aisle and you think I hope that person's
[1:22:34] not sitting beside me. You can just tell
[1:22:37] as they're coming down the aisle like
[1:22:39] that's going to be a rough flight. They
[1:22:42] are a minus
[1:22:43] 10, you
[1:22:46] know. So when you when you walk down the
[1:22:48] airplane, do they think, "Oh, I hope
[1:22:50] this person sits beside me. They look
[1:22:52] like a good uh plane mate, right?" So
[1:22:55] wherever you go, you can be a plus in
[1:22:57] the grocery store. I go down some some
[1:22:58] aisles in the grocery store and I go,
[1:23:00] "I'm buying Rice Krispies later." I'll
[1:23:02] go to because it depends who's down the
[1:23:04] aisle,
[1:23:05] right? I want you to be a plus. I don't
[1:23:08] want you to be a negative. And if you
[1:23:09] have the wrong interest, you're going to
[1:23:11] be a negative. You're going to be a
[1:23:12] minus everywhere you go. It's going to
[1:23:14] you're going to suck the life out of
[1:23:16] things a little bit. When you come and
[1:23:18] you sit on a pew, like I preach a lot in
[1:23:19] Victoria and different places. And when
[1:23:21] I see somebody there, they're looking at
[1:23:22] me and they're smiling and they're
[1:23:24] taking notes. It's a plus. You know, if
[1:23:27] every brother Donniey's preaching,
[1:23:29] everybody's frowning at him. That's
[1:23:30] hard. That's a whole bunch of minuses.
[1:23:32] But we can make such a difference
[1:23:33] wherever we go. Whether you're on the
[1:23:36] stage with a microphone or not, wherever
[1:23:38] we go, we can be a plus in our
[1:23:39] community, in our neighborhood, at our
[1:23:41] work. Hallelujah. At BAO, when you're
[1:23:44] when you're filling one of those squares
[1:23:46] and Miss Leonard's looking at you and
[1:23:48] all the kids are Miss Leonard's
[1:23:49] favorite,
[1:23:51] right? You're a plus. You're I I did a
[1:23:54] devotions with some of you and I just
[1:23:55] look at your faces and I think this is
[1:23:57] this is wonderful. It looks like they're
[1:23:59] enjoying it. I can't hear you, but it
[1:24:01] looks like they're enjoying it. So, I'm
[1:24:02] going to go five minutes longer.
[1:24:05] But I I I'm w I'm wrapping this up, but
[1:24:08] I hope you gauge and monitor your
[1:24:10] interest as you go forward. As you
[1:24:11] commence, you graduated, you're you're
[1:24:14] commencing, things are going to open up
[1:24:16] more, right? It's your life's not as
[1:24:20] much on a train track where it's like
[1:24:21] somebody else is setting the course for
[1:24:23] you. There's more options and so forth.
[1:24:25] And so, it's important more than ever
[1:24:27] that you gauge your interests. The
[1:24:29] consequences increase as you get older.
[1:24:31] what you're interested in. You can't you
[1:24:34] don't want to make crucial mistakes. You
[1:24:35] don't want to set yourself up 10 years
[1:24:38] delay your progression by 10 years by
[1:24:40] bad choices if possible, right? We're
[1:24:43] all going to make mistakes. But if
[1:24:44] possible, with the opportunity that we
[1:24:46] have with the people that around us,
[1:24:48] with the word of God, with the message,
[1:24:49] we have so many things around us to help
[1:24:52] cultivate and form us and God who is
[1:24:55] with us that to to be able to be a plus
[1:24:58] wherever we go. So, I hope that can
[1:25:00] inspire you a little bit to gauge and
[1:25:02] monitor and measure your interest. So,
[1:25:05] you can be a plus. Amen. In your family,
[1:25:09] in your home, when you're having dinner,
[1:25:11] you can be a son or daughter. You just
[1:25:12] you make things better, right? You're
[1:25:15] just a plus at the dinner table.
[1:25:17] Sometimes our family gets some sometimes
[1:25:19] gets the worst of of our of our loved
[1:25:21] ones sometimes. But we can be a plus.
[1:25:25] What an opportunity to be living in a in
[1:25:27] a home with parents that love you and so
[1:25:29] forth. Oh my. And so I hope that you can
[1:25:31] be a plus. I hope you gauge and monitor
[1:25:34] your interests and I hope something from
[1:25:36] here has helped you. And I I'm very
[1:25:38] thankful opportunity to speak to you to
[1:25:41] enjoy this weekend together. That's my
[1:25:43] commencement for you grads. God bless
[1:25:46] you richly.
[1:25:48] [Applause]
[1:26:01] Thank you, brother
[1:26:03] Kyle. We would now like to proceed with
[1:26:06] the presentation of diplomas from Bible
[1:26:08] way academy online to certify that these
[1:26:11] graduates have completed the course of
[1:26:13] study required by the school. Brother
[1:26:16] Michael Ray will present the diplomas to
[1:26:18] the graduates and I would invite you to
[1:26:21] celebrate with each graduate as they
[1:26:24] receive their
[1:26:31] diplomas. Mary Arazola

[1:27:55] Slacka, Gracie Vest.
[1:27:59] [Applause]
[1:28:09] and Joy Walbert.
[1:28:12] [Applause]
[1:28:33] We would now like to ask all of the
[1:28:36] graduates to make their way to the front
[1:28:39] and we would like to ask brother Donnie
[1:28:40] to come forward and pray for our
[1:28:42] graduates as they enter the next stage
[1:28:44] of their lives. We would also like to
[1:28:46] ask brother Barry, brother Kyle, Brother
[1:28:48] Michael, and any other ministers in the
[1:28:51] audience to come forward and pray with
[1:28:53] the
[1:28:56] graduates. Yeah.
[1:29:08] You're welcome to stand here or at the
[1:29:10] podium.
[1:29:13] God bless each of
[1:29:15] you. God bless you. Family members, all
[1:29:18] the faculty certainly appreciate it.
[1:29:21] What a great place they've come to in
[1:29:23] their
[1:29:24] lives. This may be a pastor's wife or an
[1:29:29] evangelist's wife or a teacher. I might
[1:29:32] be a
[1:29:33] pastor. You never know what you've
[1:29:35] raised in your home. You never know what
[1:29:38] God has granted to you to be able to
[1:29:41] instill in them. What a great thing it
[1:29:44] is. Can we pray
[1:29:47] together? Heavenly Father, as we stand
[1:29:49] before you tonight, Lord, and you saw us
[1:29:52] here before the foundation of the
[1:29:55] world, you see these young ladies and
[1:29:57] this young brother that have completed
[1:30:00] these years of training and education
[1:30:03] and schooling. Now, we're praying for
[1:30:05] them. Father, in the name of Jesus, may
[1:30:09] the spirit of God be with every one of
[1:30:11] them. May as they progress in life, may
[1:30:15] you always be that focal point, Lord
[1:30:18] Jesus. No matter what they face, what
[1:30:20] they go through in life, that they can
[1:30:22] look back and realize that it was you
[1:30:24] that guided them thus far. We thank you,
[1:30:27] Lord, for each of them. And we pray the
[1:30:30] blessing of Almighty God on their life
[1:30:33] tonight. We thank you for this day that
[1:30:34] we could be together. We give you praise
[1:30:37] in the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen. God
[1:30:41] bless each of you.
[1:30:46] You can go back.
[1:30:52] Brother Barry, turn this over to you.
[1:30:55] I get the last
[1:30:57] say. Thank you. It's an honor to be here
[1:31:00] and I will not be long. I only have
[1:31:02] about 12 or 15 pages here, so this is
[1:31:05] going to be brief. But really, I I want
[1:31:08] to just add my uh thanks for the honor
[1:31:11] of being here and uh to say that this is
[1:31:14] a grand moment uh not only for your
[1:31:17] graduates, and truly it is. But also,
[1:31:20] I'd like to say that it's a grand moment
[1:31:21] for uh moms and dads who are here and
[1:31:24] the sacrifices they have put forth and
[1:31:26] continue to put forth. It is a grand
[1:31:28] moment for them. And may God bless you
[1:31:30] for your efforts. uh when uh no one else
[1:31:33] had confidence that this was going to
[1:31:35] work, it worked. And that's a that's a
[1:31:38] visions that is a vision that moms have
[1:31:41] and we appreciate that very much. I'd
[1:31:43] also like to say it's a grand moment for
[1:31:44] this school and uh to come five years. I
[1:31:49] remember October 2018, Brother Biscll
[1:31:51] invited my wife and I to come to
[1:31:53] Vancouver and uh we sat with brother
[1:31:56] Michael uh and he shared with us his
[1:31:59] vision. We shared with him our vision.
[1:32:01] My wife was a um a resident expert on
[1:32:04] online uh learning u which is very
[1:32:07] different than doing a course online.
[1:32:09] And uh we put our hearts together and uh
[1:32:12] that's where the school really uh began
[1:32:15] to take root and uh since then it's just
[1:32:18] been a privilege to be able to work with
[1:32:19] brother Michael and uh to see where we
[1:32:23] have come and to see where it's going is
[1:32:25] exciting. I'm excited about what God is
[1:32:27] doing and uh you know I I I just want to
[1:32:31] say a couple of very brief things and
[1:32:33] that is this that uh you know you're
[1:32:37] graduations are the end of something and
[1:32:39] they're the beginning of something else
[1:32:40] and they're two very different things.
[1:32:41] You're going into a market. You're going
[1:32:43] into a world uh that is changing
[1:32:47] continually. Every day something
[1:32:49] different is happening in our world and
[1:32:52] uh you know stock markets and job uh job
[1:32:55] markets and uh everything is changing
[1:32:58] changing dramatically internationally
[1:33:00] things are happening. Uh it's it's just
[1:33:03] absolutely incredible to try to even
[1:33:04] keep up with it and you're becoming now
[1:33:07] representatives of the kingdom. You
[1:33:09] know, when you think about how small a
[1:33:11] percentage of uh graduates in this
[1:33:14] country during this season, how small of
[1:33:17] a percentage of graduates are
[1:33:18] Christians, number one, but number two,
[1:33:21] how small a percentage of that
[1:33:24] graduating Christian class are believers
[1:33:26] in what God has done in this last day.
[1:33:29] You represent a very small minority and
[1:33:32] you are now representatives of that
[1:33:34] kingdom. And you are uh you are to take
[1:33:38] uh you know a message of hope into this
[1:33:40] world. And I will tell you that uh you
[1:33:43] know this world is is looking for good
[1:33:45] doctors and good uh good attorneys and
[1:33:48] good uh teachers and good nurses and so
[1:33:50] forth because good employees are not
[1:33:52] always easy to find. I I'm reminded of a
[1:33:55] funny story about a local sheriff who
[1:33:57] who was running short on staff and so he
[1:33:59] needed to hire another deputy. And so he
[1:34:02] interviewed this guy. Now, he knew this
[1:34:04] young man in the community and he wasn't
[1:34:05] very all that bright, but he said, "I'll
[1:34:08] give him an interview anyway." So, he
[1:34:10] came in and he asked him, he said, "I
[1:34:11] have three questions for you." And uh he
[1:34:13] said, "I'd like you to answer these to
[1:34:14] the best of your ability." And so, young
[1:34:17] man said, "Fire away." And the sheriff
[1:34:19] said to him, "All right, what's one in
[1:34:21] one?" He said, "That's easy. It's
[1:34:23] 11." And the sheriff looked at him and
[1:34:25] said, "Well, it's not really what I was
[1:34:26] after, but let me ask you this." He
[1:34:29] said, "Name two days that begin with T,
[1:34:32] the letter T." Yeah. He said, ' That's
[1:34:33] easy. Today and
[1:34:36] tomorrow. So the sheriff said, 'Well,
[1:34:38] look, I'm going to ask you one thing and
[1:34:39] I want you to think about this very
[1:34:41] carefully. Who killed Abraham
[1:34:44] Lincoln? And the young man looked at him
[1:34:46] and he thought about that and he
[1:34:49] said, "I don't know." Sheriff said, "I
[1:34:52] want you to go home and think about
[1:34:54] that. I want you to go home and think
[1:34:56] about who killed Abraham Lincoln." So he
[1:34:58] turned and left, thanked the sheriff,
[1:35:00] walked outside. When he went outside, he
[1:35:02] met his some of his friends and uh the
[1:35:04] friends asked him and said, "Hey, how
[1:35:05] did a job interview go?" Oh, he said it
[1:35:07] was fantastic. He said, "I'm already on
[1:35:09] the job. I got my first murder
[1:35:13] case." There are not many good employees
[1:35:16] out there. And I believe that you have
[1:35:19] the opportunity, like brother Kyle said
[1:35:21] so aly, to change the world that you're
[1:35:24] in.
[1:35:25] And I will tell you this that you should
[1:35:28] learn to pursue what God leads you to do
[1:35:31] with a
[1:35:32] passion and a zeal because that's how
[1:35:36] great men left their mark on this world
[1:35:38] is not because they had it easy and not
[1:35:40] because they got all of their ducks in a
[1:35:42] row, but because they pursued the will
[1:35:44] of God with a passion and a vision that
[1:35:47] they knew was actually from God. And God
[1:35:49] cares about the impact that you make in
[1:35:51] this earth. And so be wary of uh be wary
[1:35:55] of uh uh technologies for instance that
[1:35:59] pretend to answer all of life's
[1:36:01] questions. Our world they say in a
[1:36:04] couple of years will be dominated by AI.
[1:36:06] But remember that intelligence is after
[1:36:09] all artificial. There is a wisdom that
[1:36:12] comes from God. It's found in James
[1:36:13] chapter 3 and and it says uh that this
[1:36:17] there is a wisdom from above. There's a
[1:36:19] wisdom from below but there's a wisdom
[1:36:21] from above. Both of them are called
[1:36:22] wisdom. But the wisdom from above is the
[1:36:25] mind of Christ. And you want to pursue
[1:36:27] that. And you want to I I want to
[1:36:30] encourage you to uh attain to the wisdom
[1:36:32] which only God can give. And keep your
[1:36:35] eyes on that goal that God has for you.
[1:36:38] There will be all kinds of distractions.
[1:36:40] And I will say this, I remember one time
[1:36:42] I was flying into uh into Chievac,
[1:36:45] Alaska above the Arctic Circle, and I
[1:36:47] was going to minister to a group of
[1:36:49] believers who were up there. There's a
[1:36:50] little village up there called Chivvac.
[1:36:52] And there's a thousand people in that
[1:36:54] village. The only way in is to fly in or
[1:36:56] to go in by snow
[1:36:58] machine. And in that village of a
[1:37:00] thousand people, there are a hundred
[1:37:03] believers. Now, think about that. That's
[1:37:05] one in 10 people in that community are
[1:37:07] believers. And it's just a privilege to
[1:37:09] be able to go and visit them. And I
[1:37:11] remember one of the first times I went
[1:37:14] uh I went to left Anchorage and went to
[1:37:16] Bethl and a little airport and then went
[1:37:18] to another one and we were going to take
[1:37:20] our last flight out to Chievac. And uh
[1:37:23] there was only four of us that were
[1:37:25] going on the plane for me the pilot and
[1:37:28] me and two other uh brothers who were
[1:37:30] going with me uh on the plane. And the
[1:37:33] plane was so small that this pilot, he
[1:37:36] actually went down to the end of the
[1:37:37] runway and pulled the plane up with a
[1:37:40] rope by himself up to the terminal. And
[1:37:43] I said, "No, Lord, no. You can't be
[1:37:47] serious." And sure enough, this is the
[1:37:48] plane that we were going to take. Four
[1:37:50] of us got in there and he took off. This
[1:37:52] pilot wasn't even shaving
[1:37:54] yet. I mean, he's just a young guy. And
[1:37:56] I'm sitting in the front seat with him.
[1:37:58] It's so loud you can't talk. And uh I'm
[1:38:00] looking at him and he's he's working on
[1:38:02] the controls over here. And as we fly uh
[1:38:05] out of sight of the airport, we fly into
[1:38:08] really thick clouds. Well, you know, not
[1:38:11] being a pilot myself, I I looked out at
[1:38:14] the the the clouds and I looked over at
[1:38:16] him and he's so young and I'm thinking,
[1:38:19] I'm sweating bullets. I mean, I'm just
[1:38:21] thinking, this is going to be rough. And
[1:38:24] the plane starts to bounce through
[1:38:25] there. And I noticed him uh he he was
[1:38:29] not at all looking out the window. I was
[1:38:30] looking out the window and I was seeing
[1:38:33] the the conditions out there, but he
[1:38:34] wasn't looking out the window at all.
[1:38:36] And I felt like nudging him and saying,
[1:38:38] "Look out the window so you know where
[1:38:40] you're going. It's hard to see anything
[1:38:41] out there." And he wasn't. He was
[1:38:43] looking at his instruments. He was
[1:38:45] looking at his a panel that he had
[1:38:46] there. Every now and then he glance out
[1:38:48] the window and uh uh he would uh you
[1:38:52] know check and see if there was anything
[1:38:54] out there. But every time he did, there
[1:38:55] was uh there there was just really thick
[1:38:58] clouds. There was nothing really that
[1:38:59] could identify where we were. I was
[1:39:02] getting more worried all the time. And
[1:39:04] I'm thinking because I'm just looking at
[1:39:06] the circumstances and I'm thinking, "M
[1:39:08] this ain't going to end well." And then
[1:39:10] one time I I saw when the clouds broke
[1:39:13] just a little bit, way off in the
[1:39:14] distance, there was a little orange
[1:39:16] blinking light. It was way off in the
[1:39:18] distance there. And this uh this little
[1:39:22] blinking light was a a beacon that was
[1:39:25] at the little air strip that we needed
[1:39:27] to land at. And he had in his plane in
[1:39:31] these instruments, he had a little
[1:39:33] device that locked onto that beacon. And
[1:39:36] even though he couldn't see it with his
[1:39:39] eyes, that's what he was aiming at.
[1:39:43] And by faith he knew that the plane was
[1:39:45] was uh wired to be able to pick that up
[1:39:48] and to be able to direct him all the way
[1:39:50] in even if he couldn't see the way. And
[1:39:53] eventually as we were going down through
[1:39:55] there and again now I'm just ready to uh
[1:39:57] I'm just ready to lean over and say let
[1:39:59] me do this. I'm older certainly I can do
[1:40:02] this better than you. And as I uh you
[1:40:05] know I I I didn't do it and I'm glad I
[1:40:07] didn't do it. But uh he's he's working
[1:40:09] his way down, working his way down. And
[1:40:11] finally the clouds lifted. We got close
[1:40:13] to the ground and the clouds lifted and
[1:40:16] we just uh we just skidded right in on
[1:40:18] the runway and came right up right to
[1:40:21] the edge of that runway and the beacon
[1:40:22] was right here and the propeller of the
[1:40:24] plane was right
[1:40:26] here. And he did it basically without
[1:40:29] looking out at the circumstances around
[1:40:31] him. I want to leave you graduates with
[1:40:33] this point and say that there'll be
[1:40:36] circumstances that you'll be you'll be
[1:40:37] seeing in your life that are not really
[1:40:40] making anything clear and you'll think,
[1:40:42] "Wow, that's something I need to avoid."
[1:40:45] That's not what you want to focus on.
[1:40:47] You want to focus on your
[1:40:49] destination. And God's put something in
[1:40:51] all of you as believers to lock in on
[1:40:54] that signal that comes from another
[1:40:56] dimension. and he's going to guide you
[1:40:58] right to that no matter what the
[1:41:00] circumstances are around you. And so be
[1:41:04] confident and pursue what God leads you
[1:41:06] to do with a passion. And I believe that
[1:41:08] God has a purpose for each one of you
[1:41:10] and God knows his will. Brother Brandham
[1:41:12] said his will is perfect and we believe
[1:41:15] that. Thank you. Thank you all for being
[1:41:18] here. Thank you for our staff and uh the
[1:41:21] teachers I believe have probably
[1:41:22] recovered when brother Kyle said that he
[1:41:24] got a degree without uh knowing what a
[1:41:26] noun and a verb was. There was a
[1:41:28] collective sigh. There was a shock wave
[1:41:31] that went across this this aisle of
[1:41:33] teachers right
[1:41:34] here. But I will tell you this, we are
[1:41:37] uh proud to be identified with uh with
[1:41:39] our teachers and administrative staff.
[1:41:42] And uh I just want to say may God bless
[1:41:43] you. Appreciate you being here. It's
[1:41:45] been a special, very special weekend and
[1:41:48] may God richly bless you all. Sister
[1:41:59] Jenny, we would like to now invite our
[1:42:01] 2025 valadictorian to the stage one more
[1:42:04] time to lead us in the tassel ceremony
[1:42:07] and the class recessional.
[1:42:16] Tassels mean many things in different
[1:42:17] cultures around the world. In ancient
[1:42:20] Egypt, tassels were worn on headdresses
[1:42:23] to protect the wearer from evil. In
[1:42:25] Europe, tassels denoted royal status in
[1:42:28] the wearer. In Judaism, tassels serve as
[1:42:31] a reminder of God's commandments. In a
[1:42:34] graduation ceremony, they are a symbolic
[1:42:37] ornament which is moved to symbolize the
[1:42:39] culmination of our academic efforts and
[1:42:41] the transition into a new phase of life.
[1:42:44] Graduates, to mark your achievement of
[1:42:46] graduation and the embarcation into a
[1:42:48] new chapter of our lives, you may now
[1:42:50] move your tassel from the right to the
[1:42:52] left.
[1:42:59] I present you with the Bible way academy
[1:43:02] online class of 2025.
[1:43:05] [Applause]
[1:43:21] Oh, how
[1:43:25] wonderful Jesus.
[1:43:52] God bless you all.
[1:44:06] [Music]
[1:44:10] They said
[1:44:11] Jesus will take care
[1:44:14] of our open mouth.
