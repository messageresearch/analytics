was I appreciate brother Daryl I'll say that much um appreciate being here tonight um this song that we're singing is an old one and uh uh basically I've been singing it for a long time and reason why I can't seem to get away from it is has to do with the last verse I come up here for a funeral most of you know uh you know Sister Cheryl passing and but the the thing about this last verse and I'm just going to go ahead and and read it the last verse says and there's a room filled with sad Ashen faces and without hope death has wrapped them in Gloom but at the side of a saint there's rejoicing for life can't be sealed in a tomb and I can't get that out of my mind mind and my heart tonight and and so I want to sing this tonight if you know it sing it with us we haven't practiced it so this is all practice in front of you so let's just worship God together in this and we'll see if we'll do something after this but let's just try this together it was a life filled with aimless desperation where without hope walk the shell of a man then a hand with a nail print stretched downward oh just one touch then a new life be and The Old Rugged Cross made the [Music] difference in a life Bound for heartache and defeat can you say this part now I'm going to praise him forever and ever for the cross made the difference for me oh Baron walls he good harshness and [Music] anger little feet ran in Terror to hide oh but something's changed now now those walls they ring with love warmth and laughter since The Giver of Life he moved inside oh and The Old Rugged Cross made the difference in a life bound for heartache and defeat who's going to praise him together oh I'm going to praise him forever and ever for the cross made that for me here it is now now there's a room filled with sad Ashen faces without hope death has wrapped them up in Gloom but here's the difference now but at the side oh of a saint there's rejoicing for life can't be seal in a Tom oh and The Old Rugged Cross made the difference in a life Bound for heartache and defeat oh I'm going to praise him forever and ever for the cross made that difference for me I'm going to praise him oh I'm going to praise him forever and ever Hallelujah for the cross made the difference for oh for how many's thankful has it made a difference for you Amen key of f if you would I give credit to this song to brother Daryl I was always afraid of singing this song and then I was at a meeting with brother Daryl and he sang this at the end of his ministry and in my heart I said if he can sing it I can sing it and you can sing it tonight so don't just sit here sing it with me key of f right thank you why would I worry when Giants come calling my [Music] name my God is so much bigger the troubles I face oh oh why would I hunger for power on riches or fi cuz my God is so much better than all of these things here it is so I won't be shaken no I won't be moved for my God is faithful his promise is true here it is now so I'll speak to the mountains it's time to move cuz my God is bigger better stronger greater than you how many believes what you're singing tonight oh my enemy scatter cuz they know the battle is

all amen and even when it seems like he will allow us is what it look like by the eyes of the world for us to lose you cannot lose how can you lose an almighty God is on your side praise the Lord God bless you brother Jeremy thanks for coming by and being with us amen blessing for our brother to be with us when it tonight thank the Lord as a matter of fact if I'd known a little bit more of ahead of time it would be me sitting back there and him be stand up here T not be taking serviceman next time praise the Lord um let's turn to the Book of Proverbs if you would tonight 11: 18 Lord Willam we still on tomorrow night I guess brother Joe brother Rob for question and answers all right I told our youth that I was done the last time that I did question answers on on the one question about prophets but I took care one day this week I just could not get it off of my heart and I thought hm so maybe I should look a little more boy what did I find oh my goodness so looking forward to that tomorrow night Proverbs chap 11 we've been speaking about seed for the rain we all believe the Harvest time is certainly closer than it's ever been before do we not but we know that we are not just sewing for down the road you know the latter ring that we're looking about and looking forward is going to be the Rapture the Mount Zion Showdown but while we're going that way there's a lot of seed and a lot of sewing and a lot of harvest that we're going to be doing right now in this life so Proverbs 11 chapter verse 18 the wicked workers a deceitful work but to him him that Seth righteousness shall be for a sure reward the wicked worketh a deceitful work but to him that sth righteousness so if we are righteous and then we live righteous we are sowing righteous seed so to him that Seth righteousness shall be a sure reward word also Galatians 6:7 be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man Seth that shall he also reap for he that Seth to his flesh and remember you got two main Gardens your flesh is a garden and then the spirit Capital which is not your human Spirit but the spirit of God is another Garden by which we can sew into he that Seth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that Seth to the spirit capital S shall of the capital S Spirit reap life Everlasting now listen to this quote it's very very simple but very profound and Powerful as well so don't say nothing evil about Christians don't try to harm Christians because you'll reap what you sow every time now can we differ with Christians yes and will we discuss situations that we don't understand among family members and and the family of God members we will but there's a difference in that and trying to harm Christians just remember now don't say nothing evil about Christians don't try to harm Christians because you reap what you SE every time touch not my anointed and do my profits no harm it was far better for you that you'd have a millstone tied at your neck and drowned in the depths of the sea than to offend my anointed I realize we're living in leoa which is people's rights and people are more concerned about their own feelings and their own rights and what they want to do than they are God's word but this is God's law yeah and the church said amen now want you notice that he does not just put the anointed only on preachers preachers are not the only one Anointed The Bride is Anointed Ed to be bride yeah so he don't don't just say don't talk against preachers but don't speak wrong against Christians and try to harm them so don't say nothing about Christians maybe some of them don't live just right or just do right but that's God's child let the father take care of his own kitties don't you love that vernacular let the father take care of his own kitties you know if we go to fighting one another now listen what's going to happen to us so whether it's preachers in the pulpit leoty in the pews when we go to fight one another God give us both a whipping maybe dear Jesus help us Lord help us Lord so let's just leave the other fell alone and pray for him try to love him and correct him and maybe God will help him I wonder what kind of church would' be if we took this one quote tonight just just one simple quote and try to apply this every day to our lives for the rest of our lives amen there'd be people coming from all over the world world trying to see what broke out at Word of Life Church cuz it would be so phenomenal it be so wonderful that the love of God would be so amazing Among Us and the greater his love is the greater his presence is I wonder what we would become well I can just give you a little bit of Prophecy if you want me to yeah this is the type of people that's going in the Rapture remember when he went down on the curtain of time and he said you lay aside everything so that includes everything until you get perfect love then in sort 1965 when he reiterates that story he said I believe the people that go in the Rapture will be something like what I saw before they go so you mean perfect love will be pressing its way so far into this Dimension hell is why shouldn't life hell is pressing itself all around us every day is it not you mean hell's going to do that heaven's not going going to do that I just can't believe that that's the kind of person I want to be can we just pray together Lord Jesus we believe tonight that what we've read is the truth and we thank you already for the service that we've had just for singing and worship and prayer and prayer request and Lord our brother Jeremy blessing our hearts father was with the songs and the talent the anointing that you've given him now father as we come to this p portion of the service the word and we're a needy people we stand here tonight and we're not ashamed to say that we need you we need your help oh how we long to see you moving Among Us your Prophet tells us in perfect faith that we long to see those Apostolic times moving Among Us and he said we see them but we just want to see more of them but father tonight my focus is not just on the apostolic part my focus is if we can get more of your love and more of your nature and more of your character I just believe all those other things will follow right in line as we have need of but if we focus more on the sideline and if we try to Major on minors instead of minoring on majors and putting it all out of the circumference of where you put it no telling what will make a mess out of it all we need your help tonight father speak to us your great word would you Lord shut my mouth to anything that would displease you father I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus amen God bless you Saints I trust that you all are getting a whole lot more seeds to be able to sew in your garden from these services from the text and the WhatsApp the emails the phone calls and um all the feedback that I've been getting from these Services apparently they're very very needy and uh I'd like to say and thank the Lord tonight for the testimonies that I've been hearing uh not only from our church but from other people who string the service that the Lord has delivered I don't know how many people of unforgiving spirits and all different types of things that God has already done I believe tonight will be no less of a miraculous visitation from God read with me if you would to 1 Peter chap 3:8 finally be ye all of One mind now do you believe that that is possible yes y'all believe that's possible God would have never anointed his man's servant to write that in the scripture had it not be possible now will that be of one human mind no it will not be Carol and I are born on the same day uh I was born that morning she's born later that afternoon so we have the same pattern in the stars that we're so much alike we think alike our tastes are very very similar we like a lot of things but yet there's other things that we differ on as far as day is from night that woman could eat broccoli till the cows come home if I never even look at another piece of broccoli I'm good for the rest of my life she's constantly trying to get me to eat more greens and I tell her look honey I I'm eating from the trees chocolate comes from the Cocoa Tree so I'm more of a tree guy instead of you know and we realize as far as humanly we will never and I'm afraid that Satan has tried to bring us to that spot thinking Lord in Mercy the bride will never get together how could you even think such a thought the bride will be together now it may not be together in the way that you're thinking or the way that I'm thinking it will never be of one human mind we will always differ one from the other but there is a mind a persuasion that which God will be able to accomplish and I love the way the prophet says it and souls it in prison now now the mind that was in Christ Jesus is in every believer there is the soul there is the soul now the mind that was in Christ Jesus is in every believer there is the soul there is where we will be in one mind now watch Peter says be you all of One mind having compassion one of another now we've been looking at the virtues is what also that Peter wrote about and remember these things are not something that we put on and the prophet uses the little simple illustration about a black bird trying to take peacock feathers and stick them in his cell and say see there I'm a peacock and he said why he's only a hypocrite that's all he is and he's trying to illustrate to us how important it is for us to have these things but we cannot get them on our own accord or our own ability so what are these These are attributes of the Lord Jesus himself so when the blood cell was broke open released the very nature of God it allowed it to come back inside of us so it will not be my Fai my virtue my knowledge my Temperance my joy my peace so on and so on but it will actually be his living out of you and I now one thing that we notice the Lord Jesus that was so different from the scribes and the Pharisees the scen and rodians and all them of that day was that the the four writers of the Gospel they noted that there was something about him that was really noticeably different and that was that Jesus had compassion upon the multitudes but now remember the ases the herodians the Sadducees the Pharisees they would not even allow the common people to touch them so they would go out in the marketplaces and they were just you know this holier than thou saying so before they would eat lunch they would go home and wash their hands beginning at the tips of their fingers come up to their elbows some of them would roll their garments up and come pum up to the armpits well if I was going that far I'd go ahead and go my face when you I mean just do it all but they they because maybe they had touched some of the lower class Jews while they were out so they would not put food in their mouths L some of the uh you know whatever that they had touched on the common people had got on them so you imagine then whenever Jesus would allow a woman which had an issue of blood which according to the levitical law anyone who even sat where a person sat on a couch where that person was was contaminated for several days you can imagine then when they saw this woman with this issue of blood coming out of her body and she went up and touched the Garment of the Lord Jesus automatically their minds was this man is unclean he is filthy he has been touched someone with Leprosy are you kidding me people with all types of diseases and sicknesses and they touched them and if they didn't touch him he would touch them which made it even more oh my goodness you've got to be kidding he actually went over and touched people with Leprosy he touched them with all types of plaguy and diseases he would lay his hands on them so there was something so much more different about him than just being sinless it was notably the aspect of God which was compassion now if we are truly bride we are also going to be compassionate so it's not now that we're going to do it from our heart or mind rather and we say oh yeah I have passion on people and I understand yeah I feel sorry for people no that's not it the Lord Jesus was willing to be touched by the unclean and I don't mind telling you that there is a reproach around this message of even trying to identify with people that have backl especially if it's a preacher or if it's somebody that's gotten in sin and got in trouble it's amazing how many people don't want to help them they don't want to get their hands dirty they don't want Oh you mean somebody might find out that I was there Jesus reputation was made known among the prostitutes and the foul and the unclean I ain't talking about rubbing shoulders with them and living the way they live I'm talking about them needing help and trying to find somebody that'll be willing to do it for you do we want to be that way notice he said finally be all of One mind having compassion now remember when we are living this out by the very nature of God in us we are planting the seeds which will turn right around and multiply to us again having compassion one of another love as Brethren be pitiful be pitiful what watch that means is to have pity on one another and even be Cur courteous wow I mean this is really deep stuff right I know this is not Thunders and it's not perusia it's all that sort of thing and it's something that we're not going to hear preach very often but it's still in the pages of God's word notice what the word compassion means suffering or feeling the like with another sympathetic so they notice Jesus that when he would get among the people that he wouldn't stand offish like the priest and the Pharisees and them you know that they would stand off and and the people knew better than to touch them they knew better than to get around them so they had this holy type of thing around them but there must have been something about the Lord Jesus this or of the supernatural that pulsated a welcoming atmosphere because these people had been raised up around priests and they called him a rabbi too and they must have known you don't touch a rabbi you do not get near them holy righteous men but there must have been something projected by him that was inviting to the ungodly that was inviting to those who would have plagues and have all kinds of things and they just felt a drawing oh don't you want to be that kind of child of God that people even though they may smoke and drink and run around and whatever but yet they know if they have a need they've got confidence and God don't want it just to be in the preachers God wants it to be in our body in our local assembly that they might feel a little bit ashamed of the way they look and maybe a little bit of the way they dress but they feel like you will not criticize them that you'll do what you can to help them and the church said amen having compassion one of another love as Brethren be pitiful be courteous now let's read some examples about our Master Matthew 9:36 but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them notice now nothing about what he could get out of the multitude so when he saw the multitude he was not moved with pride so that he could speak to them and give a big report that I spoke to the largest congregation that any man has ever preached to so when he saw the crowd it wasn't that something about himself was arrogantly waiting till he could go back and tell his disciples uh that I I spoke to so many today the largest crowd that's ever been known to the to a preacher to ever preached and I I spoke to him that wasn't what moved him it was compassion so it wasn't a big number it wasn't the following but what dominated his life was compassion so when he saw the multitudes now not one multitude but multitudes in plural and this is what his reaction was compassion so when you and I go into Walmart Kroger Food City Mall wherever it is we see men dressing in this day looking like women we see women looking like men anymore you don't know what they are you know you want to be courious and kind and say yes sir and yes ma'am but you don't know if you ought to or not anymore I was told not long ago one of our brothers here once in one of these drink places around you where you drive to and get a drink and they thanked the man and the man let him know that was not his pronoun so he did not want to be identified as a man so you don't know what to do so whenever we look at them what goes through our mind do we look at them with pity and compassion or do we automatically you pervert you're going to hell you rotten sorry thing but what if that pervert as You' call him is holding the life predestinated seed in the Tri City area what if that prostitute dressed woman that's that looks absolutely horrible but what if she's the next woman at the well oh my listen children we don't know we don't know my look at some of us how we were before God got a hold of us would we have ever looked like bride ain't no way would we have ever looked like what we are today no and it might be the same way today they may not come from an Apostolic church or a Baptist Church they may come straight off the street it might be a man that's wanted to be a woman for half of his life well will we welcome a Word of Life cast that devil out of them yes we'll do that first but will we welcome them and can we say come brother you believe whatever you want to believe I believe before this bride leaves this world there will not be one devil not one devil that will be conquered by somebody in this bride around the world somebody is going to conquer liver cancer somebody's going to conquer homosexuality somebody's going to conquer jealousy come on preach with me tonight somebody's going to conquer lesbianism somebody's going to conquer pride and arrogance and selfishness and so on and so on you mean you believe God's going to take a bride and say every Devil's subject to her and thousands of devils not conquered n that ain't my God my God is a mighty conqueror and the life stand of Victory will be where it was not at Calvary Paul even said it so emphatically that in that day when the resurrection of the Saints takes place then we'll be brought to pass the saying death is swallowed up in Victory how come they didn't say that when Jesus raised from the dead Hallelujah because he wanted that to be consummated in Bride form Not only would deaths be conquered by the bride but all these other evils in this age are going to be conquered somebody's going to conquer Alzheimer's somebody's going to conquer lung cancer come on Sheldon somebody's going to conquer absolutely conquer blindness and deafness and legs yes sir I believe there will be missing limbs that will be restored before the bride goes home Hallelujah but you know what it's going to take for the body Hallelujah compassion yes sir compassion notice when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them notice why because they fainted and were scattered abroad having a sheep having no Shepherd so instead of condemning and he could have instead of judging them and being harsh instead he looked at him and thought poor things they faint they're scattered they don't know what's right they're going from church to church Pillar To Post I don't know what to do oh hallelujah hallelujah Matthew 14:14 and Jesus went forth and saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion toward them and healed they're sick chapter 15:32 then Jesus called his disciples un to him and said I have compassion on the multitude because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat I will not send them away fasting lest they faint in the way now watch so in in chapter nine it's because they have no sh no Shepherd they're scattered he has compassion in chapter 14 he was moved with compassion because he needed healing in their body in chapter 15 he expresses compassion because the have material needs they were hungry naturally but if you notice Jesus didn't just say now all of you that believe I'm the Messiah you all get on one side and all the rest of you bunch of devils get on the other side and I am going to feed my followers Jesus didn't even divide him as far as belief and unbelief but he had compassion thank you Lord on the flood victims yes sir you understand what I'm saying you see friends what happens because of the type of message that we have we so narrow everything down we bring it down smaller smaller smaller I understand that concept I understand that principle but the danger is if we're not careful we'll narrow down love we'll narrow down Mercy will narrow down kindness compassion what's wrong with trying to say a kind word to these people out here it may be the only kind word some of them hear all day long I'd rather be kind to everybody what brother done what if they don't believe the message well what if they don't I don't see the Lord Jesus sorting them out and say all right all of you that believe the message come over here and I'll heal you he heals him he heals him praise the Lord but you see whenever we go to naring get down naring it down if we're not careful we get to a spot it becomes Only The Selective few that we like it ought to be something in us if we saw a rank sinner that was sick and the spirit of God moved on our heart I've done it before and I've told you of examples and Sams and Walmart and other places and I'm going to continue to do so they may never come to this church that don't make no difference I want to be like Jesus I see Jesus Healing The Sick that didn't even believe him I see Jesus reaching out a hand to help people of those that he knew would crucify make me more like Jesus oh my help us Lord chapter 18 verse 21 then came Peter to him and said Lord how of shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him a man I'm tell telling you Peter stretching this limit wow I mean he's thinking I'm so much like Jesus I'm a preacher and I I cast out Devils I'm telling you what I'm a man of God I'm going to reach out here Beyond myself I I'm going to say I'm going to say till seven times yeah what do you think of that Lord this is what Jesus thought Jesus said unto him I say unto thee until seven times but until 70 times 7 therefore is the kingdom of heaven like unto a certain King which would take account of his servants and when he begun to reckon one was brought unto him which owed him 10,000 talents now according to the price of the troy ounce of silver which is what this was the price will vary somewhat but one of the prices that I found last week in studying this was this amount 226 million 291,000 $72 and 50 CS so this is what this man owed his Lord or his master for as much as he had not to pay his Lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and children and all that he had and payment to be made the servant there therefore fell down and worshiped him saying Lord have patience with me and I will pay the all which is totally impossible then the Lord of that servant was moved with compassion I want you to listen to these words carefully and loosed him right and forgave him the debt look at the word loosed release set at Liberty let depart set free to detain no longer to let go free to acquit one accused of a crime and set him at Liberty so he owes $226 million and this master says you're free now notice he didn't go by the Avenue of wisdom of knowledge of shouting of gifts all them had their places now but what attribute was it that moved on the master compassion compassion but this man in the parable had experienced compassion but did didn't have any himself he experienced great forgiveness but didn't have any himself now watch so Jesus in his Cho choice of words it's amazing to me so he loosed him and forgave him now the first word would have been powerful enough but then Jesus uses another word to let go to disregard not to discuss so you're not only loose from this you and I will never mention this again when you get around me don't even bring it back up again oh I'm I'm so thankful you forgive me I'm so thankful I'm don't no no it is taken care of to such a degree we will never talk about this again now keep this in mind what this man received but he he himself is fixing to reverse being loosed and being forgiven well y'all listening good tonight they always tell me is a good time to sew seed when the wind wasn't blowing then the Lord of that servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave gave him the debt but the same servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him 100 P which is 17 $17 compared to $226 m291 72 50 so this man owes him 100 p and he laid hands on him now look at the difference in this servant and the master the the the Bible Jesus in giving the parable does not say that the Lord this King laid hands on this man that owed him millions of dollars now this is Express ex of intense anger so he laid hands on him and took him by the throat I mean this guy is in a mess Ain now you would agree with me that this man experienced forgiveness this man experienced compassion this man experienced being being loosed from a terrible terrible debt but he did not know how to do the same thing for a man who owed him $17 now remember Jesus is setting this forth in a parable so it's a story Parable is a Earthly story with a Heavenly meaning so this is like the kingdom of heaven so in the Kingdom of Heaven going to be all kinds of people like this so this man now is released and loosed and boy he's so glad for himself but he is so harsh and so judgmental now watch the king is almighty God of course in the parable and then the man that owed the millions of dollars will call him Donnie Paul Daryl Jeremy Scott Carol Barbara Linda you you you and you Jesus is trying to get us to see our indebtedness to God was so tremendous there's no way we could ever settle it so he forgave us oh my and then he turn goes out and sees this friend of his and he took him by the throat saying pay me that thou owest and his fellow servant fell down at his feet and besought him now notice he's saying some of the exact same things that he said so it wasn't that he was saying weird bizarre things that was off the pattern you see Jesus said this exactly on on purpose he sure knows how to say stuff don't he so he's saying the right things and got the right approach and no doubt has an element of sincerity because apparently to this man $17 was a tremendous amount and he besought him saying have patience with me and I will pay thee all and he would not but went and cast him into prison is till he should pay the debt now somebody please explain to me you're going to put a man in prison because he owes you so much money tell me how's he going to work in prison and pay you off I mean I realize I'm d a c bucket if you're smarter than this cold bucket C bucket go ahead and tell me what you know it don't make any sense to me but I want you to notice the terms as Jesus goes on and he said so when his fellow servants saw what was done they were very sorry and came and told unto their lord all that was done then after then his Lord after he had called him said unto him oh thou Wicked servant uhoh so even after being loosed and being forgiven of the former debt he has now accumulated apparently this tremendous debt another debt but this time it was against one less fortunate than himself dear God speak to us tonight oh thou Wicked servant I forgave thee all that debt because thou desirest me that was the only reason I forgive it because you wanted me to and had compassion on you should us not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow servant even as I had pity on thee so you mean the Lord Jesus wants us as his forgiven people to be able to forgive those who trespass against us now remember this whole Parable is an answer to this preacher's question I like to emphasize that this is a preacher it shows you they're not perfect either amen so this whole Parable and story was an answer to this preacher's question about forgiveness now I want you to notice how strange and his Lord was Ross and delivered him to the tormentors now how is this possible his debt was clean now the word that Jesus uses here you see there was two categories of crimes of things that we're talking about so to be able to grab that Man by the throat in some countries would be assault but they did normally did not turn a deor over to the tormentors now the tormentors were people in the criminal prisons and they would beat criminals uh they would keep food from them talk to them really really bad and really really treat them bad because they were a criminal but a debtor's prison was simply for people who didn't pay their debts so normally it was not normal for them to be tormented but you see this man after receiving forgiveness and not having really understood it even his own torment was changed from a Dead's prison to a criminal's prison because he had experienced such forgiveness and such Mercy Mery and such compassion and he was forgiven Millions hundreds of millions of dollars and yet he did not have $17 worths of Mercy oh so by law if this man's debt was eliminated so he was loosed and forgiv gave how could this man ever by the court of law ever bring this man back in brother Jeremy and say send him to prison why well he owes me well but but but sir you you forgave him here we have many witnesses that heard you say that you forgive him children look what being uncaring and cold and not min ministering compassion look how the Lord looks at it did the Lord forgive him did the Lord loose him well how is this man going to go to prison then how is he going to the tormentors and they are going to torment this man because he had no compassion on fellow human beings wow you see the big debt was from a fallen sinner to a mighty God which could never be paid by any mortal but the other debt was from one mortal to another mortal one flawed human being dealing with another flawed human being but the evaluation that they placed upon thems and upon that other human being was so different and by simply that one deed it was going to get this individual thrown into torment makes me want to be kind to everybody if I'm guilty okay if I'm guilty let me be guilty of loving people that'll never be bright just let me be guilty of offering a smile to somebody that may never even walk down the streets of God let me be guilty of reaching out my hand to help others anybody with me tonight you know what because I've tapped into a source that there's no end to his love and mercy and compassion so it ain't like that I've got this little teeny bit of goodness and mercy and man I've got to be a scrooge you know I've got to just D it out just a little bit here I'm I'm afraid I'm want to run out what if all I've got is my own I will run out but if I've tapped into eternal life there's no end to it oh my the more I give out the more he'll put in me to give out and the more we love I believe the more love he'll pour in us to love out look at our Master we got so many of our brothers that want to be like Jesus but why is it they always relate to signs and wonders and miracles when we're talking about being like Jesus right ain't there no preachers in this message that wants to to be like this like Jesus yes sir is all we one of Jesus the miraculous and the supernatural Don't We Want to Love Like Jesus don't we want to try to help the people that's in such need if there was I believe with all in our heart if Jesus was here on the earth in this time frame he would be reaching out exactly the same way he did whenever he was here before well he ain't here but I am he ain't here but you are let them know there is a risen savior hallu oh my and his Lord was Ross and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him oh my now listen Jesus still going on with the parable so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you now remember this still is an answer to Peter's questions if ye from your hearts forgive not all your special friends and all your close family and all of those that you really really like that's our modern day version ain't it from your heart forgive not everyone his brother their trespasses and Word of Life Church said and then Word of Life Church also said help me Lord help me Lord to be more like you I'm not interested in Walking On Water friends I have no need of walking on water in this day and age I have no need of doing some of the things that Jesus did I have no need of doing some of the things that Moses did most of us can afford to buy groceries I don't need to pray that God will ring quail and bread out of Heaven if we needed that I'd have enough Faith to be able to do it I believe God would do it don't you yes I do if we're out of gasoline I believe we could pour uh water in our tank I mean you know brother walls brother Mike Wall's grandfather that happened to him years and years ago he was scheduled to go preach a meeting and didn't have gas to put in his car so they poured water in the gas tank and prayed over it and God turned it into into gas if he could turn water into whne and turn water into gasoline well come on plus you don't have to pay federal Exile tax on it too so I mean that's pretty good deal you me if I needed gas in my car and didn't have the money my God could do it but as long as I can do it I wouldn't have faith enough to ask him but I've got faith to ask him tonight give me more love Lord give me more compassion Lord May Word of Life Church not only be not known as a nice church and a church who does this and that and the other may we be known as a compassionate loving people that can forgive those that run us down and talk about us come on somebody let's have church on Wednesday night let us be known Our Testimony be known that we pray for those that despitefully use it and we forgive those that trespass against us amen oh my 1 John 3:17 who so hath this world's good and seeth his brother have need and shut us up his bows of compassion from him how dwell us the love love of God in him so here the Apostle of Love is questioning where a person was truly even born again if they had material means to help someone else who was needy and they wouldn't do it if you lived in the first century they questioned your Holy Ghost well if they questioned it I think I've got a right to do the same you say I'm not a judge but I am a fruit inspector comes with my vocation I'm a fruit inspector now watch Peter says finally be all of One mind having compassion one of another love as Brethren be pitiful and the meaning of that word is tenderhearted and compassionate be courteous and this is one of our struggles in this age right here I want to give you a warning right here th Tire Church age it says concerning the last days that because of abounding iniquity the love of many will wax cold in the L of sin or last age self love and love for material things will take place of the true love of God listen selflove and love for material things will take the place of the true love of God we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days so many listen now this is a warning to us this is our time frame so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this last day spirit I don't mind telling you some of the hardest people I've ever dealt with in my life are message people and you know what's heartbreaking I preach in a lot of Youth conventions and a lot of Youth Camps over the years and I've seen youth you know from this high and watch them grow up and become bigger and bigger and bigger and taller and older more mature and so on and so on but you know what is also so heartbreaking is to walk watch them become hard-hearted to where the word no longer moves them they don't have no more tears to cry you don't see them make an altar anymore you don't see them because you know they've sat there and they've went from one Youth Camp to another to another and they've got Camp meet and cramps as the prophet said and they've heard this preacher that preacher that preacher their pastors tried to bring in ministers you no matter where they go to church that would be a blessing and a help to them and it becomes to where well so what you know we've had this guy and that guy and that guy I want somebody that'll move me it ain't somebody that'll move you it's you moving yourself it's you surrendering your selfishness to the Lord God what is going to dominate L to seea but it will not dominate The Bride self love self love oh come on I wish somebody preach with me tonight it's going to be one of the things that every person in this building must put under your feet even with the Holy Ghost it will be something that will war against our flesh because there's something that the part of the anointing the accumulative spirit of the last day will dominate self why it is Satan trying to make man think he is a God right so man what he got self-help books on this and self-help on that and self-help on something else we might as well admit it we cannot help ourself we are lost without God even after we become Christians we need the Holy Ghost after we get the Holy Ghost we still need to be corrected by the word of God but look at a lot of the message people stay home and play a tape they wouldn't darken a church door for nothing why they fell underneath this thing of selflove people sitting at home and rather stream than they would to put Force effort come to the house of God I say shame on you if you're able to come to the house of God you ought to be here tonight you ought to come in them doors praise the Lord with an attitude I'm going to well a little headache set me back well a little headache keep you from the soccer game and the football game come on somebody you'll go to a basketball game when your granddaughter's playing with a headache and you'll stay home and you got one and miss the house of God I say shame on you what's doing it self love and people losing the love for the house of God they're losing the love for the word they're losing the love for one another woo because of abounding iniquity the love of many shall wax wax cold in the lead of s or last self love and love for material things probably most of us have got more things than we've ever had in our life are we better off or do most of those things take up more of our time it's amazing how many people are in love with things you know why it's easier to love a thing than it is a person that's a thorn in your side God ain't going to use your car to Humble you God ain't going to use your poodle dog to get you to heaven God may use a person that's nothing but a big Brier right in your side and they love that seat right across from you and they sat there and look at you and you look at them and they Bri you every time you come to church and God said go ahead and gouge him cuz he's got too much flesh in there and then he'll have somebody else gouging them and then they're gouging you and you're gouging them why character does not come as a gift it must come by molding and making and shaping and we're living in a time when God is Not catering to our every wh we're not a bunch of spoiled brats and God's got to give us everything we ask for or we ain't going to serve him if he never answers another prayer I pray for the rest of my life I'm going to serve him I don't deserve anything he's done for me I don't deserve him being so good to me he don't have to Baby me he don't have to answer every prayer that I pray and when he says no he Oh my he offers me and I do not demand an explanation if he says no I'll say yes sir if he says wait a while I'll say yes sir why because I owed Millions times Millions times millions and he said Donnie I lose you I lose you and in order for me to stay Loos I'm going to lose loose you so if you trespass against me I'm going to loose you I'm going to set you free so when you stand before the Lord that debt won't be hanging over you I want to stay loose oh my it is time to draw nigh to God and let him fill our lives with his love or we will feel the coldness of the last day Church there any honest Christian in here tonight that say yep I've felt that before well I will whether y'all will or not and I don't like it come on somebody I don't like it brother Jack and when I feel it I say hey you leave me alone you get away from me I don't want to be cold I don't want to be lukewarm there's only one option for me burning fire amen I'm going to be on fire now so I won't be on fire later that's exactly right I choose Holy Ghost Far Over Hellfire I choose the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and my soul so saturated the presence of God brother the D do you have to fight it why of course I do it's a spirit in the last day but I am fighting fighting and I am winning by the grace of God I said I am fighting and I am winning you I feel cess about worship sure I feel cess about this and that the other sure but I only feel it for a while and I'll tell cess to get out of my life I ain't got room for you in my life Hallelujah I ain't got room for no l to see self-love coldness of the last day it is time to draw an eye to God and let him fill our lives with his love or we will feel the coldness of the last day church and reject the truth of God which alone is able to help us oh no Lord don't let us go that way don't let us be forgiven of so much and loosed of so much tradition so much sin so many things that's unlike the Lord and then we turn right around and shut off our bowels of compassion and become so isolated from everybody El my it's becoming that way and the message we becoming so so divided and so separated how many is going to be left when we all get done well first of all we need to quit playing God let God be God and you just be happy that you're part of the family of God let God do the separa let God do the judging notice Peter again let's pick up this word courteous finally be of all of One mind having compassion one of another love his Breen be pitiful be courteous friendly kind oh my not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing railing is to speak reproachfully or reviling but contrary wise blessing so when somebody rails against you you bless them and I don't mean bless them out and some of y'all is good at blessing life blessing that that that is what Peter was saying notice blessing this is the root word of where the word a lot of us don't even like eulogy cuz we think eulogy you know is just all for the sectarian religion but notice this eulogia fair speech praise fine discourse an invocation of blessing oh my goodness so when somebody rails to speak reproachfully against you and revile you you are to bless them not out but in so you speak fair speech praise fine discourse and invocation of blessing well you know what friends I just realized maybe maybe my Bible has got some verses in it that y'all's Bible don't have have I got a strange version or something really okay so this is all's Bible okay man I sweating her from minut I just thought I was reading from some foreign book but the look shall got on your face tonight it just seem like y was like I was from another planet or something I Am From Another Dimension martians ain't got nothing on me believe me knowing notice now not rendering evil for evil raing for raing but contr eyes blessing knowing that you are there unto called so we're called to be bride we're called to be baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus we call to heal the sick raise the Dead cast out Devils but this is also part of our calling yes sir that's good well if I'm called to do it guess what I'm going to do her right anybody going to do it with me knowing that ye are there un to called that ye wow so you mean me sowing blessing for railing I'm sowing seed yeah and then the last part of that verse that you should inherit a blessing so when I bless those that run me down and talk about me and you know just whatever more I'm actually sewing seeds for my own good and I will inherit a blessing yeah yeah thank you Lord verse 10 I love this verse for he that will love life you're blessed if you love life cuz a lot of folks in the age were living simply don't they don't want to live for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil harm of a bad nature not such as it ought to be Troublesome injurious pernicious or destructive let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no gu let him escue evil and do do good let him seek peace and ensue it let him seek it and ensue it es skew run away from depart from not be near a skew evil and do good and seek peace look friend our life is a lot about choices if you want to be sad there's enough in life to be sad about I choose to be happy by the grace of God hey look I deal with so much sickness I deal with so much deaths I deal with I don't know why it's been my lot in life as a pastor to have to deal with so much deaths so much sickness constantly being contacted every day every day with so much stuff going on around the world oh I I I I I just get so worn with it sometimes with so much sickness and so Much Death and so much suffering and if you don't let the spirit of God help you under such a state You' never have nothing to be happy about but I'm so happy cuz there's a world coming that there won't be no more of it I'm so happy that we have a God to take all of our troubles to come on somebody oh I know you got you folks have got things you could be really really sad about you've got all kinds of things going on your life but you can choose to be happy in the midst of your trials you can choose to be happy it is your choice do you want to be Laden down and oh I got this grim look on your face all the time or do you want to say the lord gave and the Lord take away blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah oh my let me close here in Hebrews 10:24 let us consider here's another seed for you to put in your basket let us consider one another to perceive remark observe understand consider attentively so not just a casual how are you brother but consider attentively let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works and the church said amen let's B our heads praise the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord no one looking around now I wonder how many say Lord that was so true but I admit I need help with certain Avenues of it in my life father just raise your hand to him God bless you and and me say this if if you're already doing these things it's not so much that you're saying that you don't do it at all but you just want more of it you want more of it to you want it to abound in your life and to flourish and be exactly what the father you're called to be this children we're not just called to be Pride but we're called to have a certain attitude a certain Behavior a certain way that we should do don't you understand it's more than just getting together and well we're going to lift an offering and we're going to help some Churches over in Uganda we we've we've done that many many times we just did it just recently because they're experiencing some famine in certain parts and we've built churches by the grace of God all over the world we've helped buy food we've helped drill water wells we we've helped do all kinds of things like that but it's more than that that's people without a face you people if I lift an offering here tonight and say you know there there's these requests over here and over there I know what y'all would do y'all would drop money in there they don't tell how much we'd raise here in one night just no notification at all just telling you tonight but why is it we find it so much harder for those that we go to church with and we may have a little hard feeling toward or a little grievance toward it's so much easier for us to be kindhearted and tenderhearted to those that we don't know or an individual without a face or just a name or they live in a certain country but the real test is for those who don't like you as a matter of fact the prophet tells us eternal life is living for others and he said you live for that man that would kill you if he could I want you to think about that a man or woman that would absolutely kill you if they had the opportunity to do it and they could get byow was it and yet you would do something above and beyond the Call of Duty for that individual to help them you see that's what Jesus did so his life is the same whether it's in his human body or in mine or in yours now friends we're talking about bride material we've had all kinds of so-called bride revivals it's went from one theological term to another it's went from one emotional spin to another but what I'm preaching about to you from the scriptures and from the message is something this bride will have before she leaves this world hallelujah oh Lord Jesus as we bow our heads to the dust of the earth and if time goes on unless we or changed each of us will go by this way we don't know that there's a one of us here tonight that'll be back even here Sunday but we want to live every day of our life as if though it could be our last because it could be so Lord we don't want to have to call this person and that person and apologize for saying this or doing that or sewing Discord against them or what whatever Lord cuz we might be taken out of life within a matter of seconds tonight on our way home an automobile will run across the road and our life will be ended so I wouldn't have time to pick up my phone and call somebody and say hey would you forgive me I said this about you and I talked about you and I I did that and I'm I'm really sorry won't be no time so we want to live every day of our life was every debt settled so if there's things we need to make right we want to make them right now I don't want to wait till Sunday if there's anybody in this building or anyone around the world that I need to fix something with them I give you my word as your son if you will show me I will do it before the dawn of another day if there's something I need to fix something I need to apologize for I want to live every day of my life Lord God as if though it were my last Lord Jesus may you move among the ministers tonight as I mentioned it a few weeks ago to me it's no real great surprise really that as a message Community we're not any farther up the road than what we are because of the way sometimes preachers act and they're the leaders so if they're arguing and fussing and debating and this building a kingdom and this and wants a build a bigger Kingdom and this and that and the other how and the work can we expect the people to be any closer to God but if every godall man could realize he's called to edify the body not the body edify him he's called to serve he's called to bring things that'll help the body even most of the time when it will kill him to have to do it but he's called to do it help us Lord Jesus I want to be like you Lord as I mentioned earlier I have no desire to walk on water it's something I've never wanted to do I've never wanted to be able to prophesy who would be the next president or I've never wanted to be an outstanding person a great person so you could tell me this and that and I could get up and tell people well the Lord told me this and the Lord told me that the Lord told me something else and it come to pass I've seen what that produces I have no desire for that Lord but I do want to love like you I want to forgive like you cuz in the parable I don't see that this man this man didn't believe in speaking in tongues or this man didn't run or this man didn't quote the scripture and this man didn't know the Greek and the Aramaic but this man failed to show compassion and he reoccurred this massive massive debt which had him thrown not in the Dead's prison but the prison where the criminals went and there he would be tormented help us Lord God I have been forgiven much oh I didn't get out and drink around do all that stuff but I failed you so many times I've grumbled and complained and wished I wouldn't a preacher and wish I didn't have to go this way and that way and preach certain things and and that's been wrong with me and I'm so sorry we love you tonight Jesus we
