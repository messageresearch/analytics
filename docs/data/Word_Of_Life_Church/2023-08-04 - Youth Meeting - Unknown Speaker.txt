[Music] 103 starting at verse 1. very familiar scripture to us all and a Psalm of David it says bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name bless the Lord O my soul and forgetting all all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases how many diseases does he heal he heals them all also from Exodus 15 26 just a portion of that scripture says this for I am the Lord that healeth thee I am the Lord that healeth thee let's bow our heads father we just commit this evening into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name God bless you may be seated now look I didn't come to preach to you tonight and give you a sermon so you can all relax I just want to come and they asked me to take just an evening to maybe just share some of the things that we've seen the Lord do how many of you sitting here tonight has ever been healed of the Lord anybody here ever been healed see look at all the hands so you see God is our healer he can heal cancer he can heal physical trouble mental trouble spiritual trouble whatever need would be there's not a situation that's greater than our God you know one of the things that stands out to me is not just healing because you can be healed you know and then you get sick again you can be healed of of a disease and end up getting that disease again we we know those things are true but what always touches my heart more than healing is conversions is to see someone give their heart to the Lord and one that stands out to me that I'll never forget was on the Apache Indian Reservation and we was preaching there one night and there was a an Indian just a typical Apache probably in his late 60s and he had a bandana around his head and hair done to his shoulders and just the the look of an Indian and his and he he came walking up the aisle and this arm was artificial it was missing and this lead was artificial so he didn't have no arm or no leg and he'd come walking up the aisle with this artificial arm and leg and when he got about where me and and Paul is I could smell the alcohol on him he was drinking and he walked up to me and I said buddy do you need something from the Lord and he just laid his head over on my shoulder and just began to cry like a baby he was just balling his tears was making my shirt wet and I looked at him and I thought poor fella he said they they took his land away from him put him out here on this reservation and he said he probably drafted him into the army and probably lost that arm and leg in Vietnam he told me he said I don't want to hate no more he said I'm tired of hating he said lead me to that Jesus that you preached about tonight and he was just weeping on my shoulder and we prayed with him well about a month later I called Kevin after the meetings of Brother David Siler I mean Brother David was in those meetings together down there and I called brother Kevin and we was talking I said hey how's my buddy doing talking about the gentleman that had come up and he said I said she's still going to church and he said well he did for a while brother Daryl but he quit and I said he quit I said why did he quit he said he took sick and died I said died he said he died brother Daryl said I went down to his family to pay my respects and so to me said Kevin said he died so peaceful I said all the bitterness and hatred was going out of his heart he said he died so peaceful and I said Kevin what happened to his arm and leg do you know what happened to it he said he lost it in Vietnam brother Daryl but I thought here's a man just three or four weeks away and all the years that he carried hate and bitterness in his heart and three or four weeks before he left the Earth he found Jesus and he died so peaceful another thing that just stands out before we look at some things is sister Rebecca Brandon Smith years ago when my mama was sick she gave me a piece of brother Brandon suit I've still got it and I've carried it with me a lot when I feel like I'm going to pray for the sick and different things and so there was a gentleman down in Arkansas and if I remember right his name was David King I believe that was the man's name and he had went to the doctor and he had a cancer between his sternum and his heart and so he asked if I had a prayer cloth that I could send him he a brother called me and I said sure I'll be glad to send himself just told me so they gave me his address well I'm going to be honest with you I I didn't want to send him the whole piece of brother bring him suit so I pulled a thread I'm telling you the truth I pulled a thread out of that put it in an envelope and sent it to the Man he got that thread it was just a thread off of that off of the suit put it on prayed he went back to the doctor was not one sign of Cancer completely healed there's just nothing that our God can't do you know the first time I ever remember experiencing the Lord I was about three-year-old and there was a guy my daddy was a tent boy for a guy by the name of Bobby Pruitt no kin to temper it in him and they was having tent meetings and my daddy he would they call him tent boys they would travel around and set up the tents and so that put the chairs up and all that when the meeting was over they tore it down so if I remember right out like I said I was only about three-year-old but I think it was down in Kingsport come a big rain and it got muddy and we was going into the tent for the service and I slipped in the mud and fell on the tent stop and broke this collarbone this one right here and I just remember parts of it because I was just a young boy but it's the first time I ever experienced the Lord and they took me into the tent because if you break your collarbone you can't raise your arm and so Bobby Pruitt prayed for me and I remember having mud and so he prayed for me and he had me to do jumping jacks and when the man prayed for me God instantly healed me of a broken collarbone and I just remember doing the Jumping Jacks and the people screaming and praising the Lord because this little boy had just been healed of a broken collarbone he's God he could do anything I gave my heart of the Lord when I got out of the army I was 21 year old down here in Jonesboro and I know many of you have heard me tell that I was in the old building down there by myself and so when I went back to school in January I went back to ETSU and everybody they just couldn't believe the change that it took place in my life because in December I was a pretty rough character in January I was a new person and so I started witnessing the people about the Lord and I remember one day that I was walking on the campus and I was just kind of down in my spirit and I was just talking to the Lord and I said Lord I said how are we ever going to get out of here you know sometimes you just get weary you know and I was you seem like you talk to people about the Lord and they didn't want to hear anything you had to say you know and I was just kind of down I said Lord how are we ever going to get out of here and I was just walking like that just talking to the Lord and something said look up and when I did there was a tractor and trailer went out in front of me and on the side of the tractor and trailer in big old letters was the word Grace yeah it's Grace we're going to get out of here by the grace of almighty God and you know God will be just as real to you as you'll let him be and so many times he speaks to us but sometimes we're so busy that we fail to hear his voice so I've been serving the lord and witnessing and it come on my heart to preach and I thought how in the world do you start preaching I didn't know how to start preaching so I was working at the VA in surgery I believe it was or maybe I was going to school for surgery at the time to be a surgical technician but anyhow I took off and I went to the riverbank down in Kingsport and I spent all day praying and I said Lord if you want me to preach if you'll open the door I'll walk in it but how do you start preaching I don't know how to start preaching so I come home that afternoon been out there on the riverbank praying and Cheryl said my wife you know Cheryl and she said brother Phillips he was the pastor before Brother Don he said brother Phillips called I want you to call him so I called brother Phillips and I said brother flips this brother darling I said Cheryl said you wanted me to call you he said yeah brother Daryl said I was praying today and said the Lord put on my heart to ask you if you'll take the service Wednesday night oh my Lord y'all should have been there it was the shortest message I ever preached in my life 15 minutes you you missed it now you get those errors in the half but it was 15 minutes and I spoke on what Jesus did for me he'll do the same for you and I just told him how the Lord touched my heart so I started preaching and the Lord spoke to me one evening and said when you turned 30 you'll start traveling and I was working with the young people as young people's leader I was Joel's young people's leader and Jennifer's young people's leader and we had some great times used to get into my basement have prayer meetings and all my we just some good times working with the young people some of the menstruals talking the other day that we missed those days of when we used to work with the young people but now the Lord said when you turn 30 you'll start traveling and when I turned 30 year old I was sitting in the old church and there's a man sitting about three rows up in front of me and I looked this way and how you looked around and see who's in church and what they're wearing y'all don't do that well there's an alder up here just come on up in a few minutes you can get it right as I was looking around you know seeing who was there and who was misbehaving and so I saw this man and I looked this way and I looked and I looked back that way and I come back around and when I looked at the back of this man's head a voice spoke to me and said join yourself to that man you'll speak for him so I go out and the best of you and was sitting there and this guy walked right up to me and he said I said brother Daryl said I'm brother Bill Anderson from down in Columbia South Carolina said I have a church in Beaufort and he said I was praying about an evangelist and he said the Lord put on my heart to ask you if you'll come and preach for me and I was going yeah yes sir yes sir and so that was when I started traveling started preaching and when I started traveling you know I joined the army to see the world and you know where I went North Carolina spent all four years of my military in North six hours from home and so when I started traveling you know going to Charlotte airport and Atlanta I didn't know anything about that stuff and it made me nervous I was just just a kid and I you know I just didn't know anything about that stuff and and so I was praying one night I was in my study praying and when I was praying the Lord spoke to me a scripture to my heart and I'll be honest with you I had no idea what the scripture said I just know the Lord spoke this scripture to me Psalms 121. and so when I got done praying I got up open up my Bible to Psalms 121 verse 8 and this is what it said it said the Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forward and forevermore I have traveled over 1.3 million miles preaching the gospel in a car I've got almost a million miles in an airplane but he's brought me home every time he's brought me home because God don't give you a promise that he don't keep if God promised you anything he'll keep that promise sometimes our friends will lie to us we know that sometimes the people closest to us will lie to us but he will never lie to us whatever God told you that's what he'll do he's been truth of that promise so I just want to share with you just a few things when you've had enough just raise your hand and we'll quit Okay because I don't want to preach to you but just just want to share some of these things that I've seen the Lord do and some of it I know you've probably heard me preaching so you've probably heard them before but just as I was thinking and trying to write down a few things but just want to share some things with you I want to look at the thinkings of of healings down in Mexico you know the the brother Branham said about the Spanish people he said the Spanish people get their healing because they humble themselves and they're willing to eat the crumbs and I've seen the Lord do so many things among the South American people because they're just a humble people you know you just tell them and they believe it and that's it you know they don't they don't have to figure it out reason it out and so I was some of the things that I've seen the Lord do I was down there among the Maya Indians and the Maya Indians don't they don't even speak Spanish they got their own language they got the Mayan language I saw I was down there and I was preaching in English and they was interpreted into Spanish and the Spanish was being interpreted into the Maya and they was giving it to the Maya people so I had two interpreters and so this woman came up for prayer and she spoke to me in Maya which I didn't understand the word she said and I turned to my interpreter banaya and he said brother I don't speak mine he said but I do know enough of it to know that she said something about her ears and I said okay well we'll just pray for her so I took my fingers and I stuck them in her ears like that and just prayed for her and when I did when we said amen she goes just like this and she turns around to her friend and grabs her friend and pushes her up there and I told her I said the Lord just healed her because you see when the Lord does something for you the first thing you want to do is tell somebody it makes you a witness and so she was witnessing of our healing of her healing no when I started preaching I've not shared this to just a few people but I want to share it with you tonight since you're my buddies I was in Virginia sitting on the front row my brother Charlie Spencer which is brother Ron Spencer's Daddy he said and the meetings up there went up brother Donnie was preaching we went up there to hear brother Donnie preach and he goes brother Ward do you sing I said no sir not a lick well when I said that everybody started laughing and I embarrassed myself and so I was sitting on the front row and I said Lord what have you called me to do had a voice spoke to my heart just as real as I'm talking to you and said I've called you to pray for my sick children and I've always tried to do that because I feel like that's what he wanted me to do as a brother said the Lord told him I was the pastor at church he said the Lord told him I was to be the pastor of this church and I thought well if the Lord told him then I'm supposed to pastor and I'm the one that's supposed to do it he should be able to tell me ain't that right especially if I'm the one that's supposed to do it but you know I said well I appreciate you so I prayed about it and I prayed earnestly about it for like three years I waited on the Lord to give me an answer and I was down in Kentucky now that brother Billy lasters you know who that is don't you buddy brother Billy lasters I was I was down there we was deer hunting with Joe Pewitt and them guys down there and I was in a tree stand and I said Lord those people deserve an answer if you'll tell me what to do I'll do it if you want me to take that church I'll take that church if you'll just tell me and while I was in the street stand a voice spoke to my heart and gave me two names and said you'll preach for these two brothers and by this you'll know you're to stay on the field well I come out of the woods and brother Billy Laster he's gone to Glory now he had killed a cow we had a big steak dinner and he invited all these brothers to come to this steak dinner well when I went to his house for this dinner those two brothers was at the house and both of them that night asked me to come and preach so I go back up to where the brother said that the Lord told him I was the pastor of the church and I took a message on the sons of God are led by the spirit of God and I told the people I can't take the church because the Lord told me to stay on the field as an evangelist down in Mexico in those meetings down there just as I got ready to read my scripture they decided that there's going to kill a pig to feed the people that week and just as I started reading over here was a girl in the world couldn't you wait till at least got done preaching so anyway we had pig that whole week that they killed right when the service started they decided to kill the pig but at the end of the service I went into the kitchen to thank the sisters for cooking all week for us and there was a sister there who had cancer and she was so sick but she had she was cooking and there's another sister there who wanted to have a baby and so we pray and asked the Lord to heal the sister with the cancer and to give this other sister a child because they had labored so hard for the young people well about two years later I was back down in Mexico again and I run into those two sisters and the one that had the cancer was completely healed and the other one had a little two about a year and a half something like that just a little baby was holding in her hands God honored both of them for working so hard for his young people remember the story of the diabetic ulcer you may remember that story I was in a meeting and I preached on the bride's checkbook and that the checkbook has already been signed and all you have to do is fill out what you have need of because it's already been signed by Jesus Christ you know brother bear preached about that and so I was preaching on the bride's checkbook well this man came up and I was at Walmart and I bought this watch for 10 bucks and sure said why are you buying a watch you got two or three of them I said I don't know it's just a good deal I just you know if it's a good deal buy it right so I took it with me and when I got down there I seen this man and I gave him the watch well the man that I gave the watch to he came up for prayer he pulled up his pants leg and he had an ulcer a diabetic ulcer they had eight I could see the bone through the wound in his leg and it was going to amputate his leg because of the the bone gets infected it's got to come off and so he came up for prayer and he said I want to write a check for the helium of my leg and so we prayed with him well about several months later I was back down in that part of Mexico again and he come running up to me and when he did he goes like this shows me the watch I still got it I said well praise the Lord and he pulled up his pants leg and that tumor of that that diabetic ulcer that ulcer that was on his leg was completely healed there was just a little dark spot where the ulcer had been completely healed and so he told him he goes back to the doctor and the doctor says tell us what you did and we'll tell the other people to do that because we have other people that were going to take their leg off because of diabetic ulcers said tell us what you did and we'll tell them to do that and he said I told him I wrote a check to the bank of Heaven God healed him of a diabetic ulcer healings of those on canes the brother if you'll put the picture up yep that's a good news anyway I was down in Missouri here a while back and this sister I think they'll put the picture up in a minute but this sister was on this on this walker and so I said sis have you ever thought about getting your hip fixed and she said they won't operate on me because I'm in stage four kidney failure I said kidney failure she said yeah they won't operate on me I said well let's just pray we wasn't even in church we was actually at a fellowship hall eaten and so I just sat down beside her and took her by the hand I said well let's just pray God will heal your of your kidneys and get you hip operated on well I was down in Oklahoma just a couple of months ago back in June preaching for brother Bryce Collins and the sister I've got the picture but I guess they can't get it up but the sister came up to me she said brother Daryl she said you remember me I said yeah she said I'm gonna get my hip fixed I said you are she said yeah she said you know brother I said I went to the doctor said they couldn't find nothing wrong with the kidneys and she said I just come from a six-month checkup because it was last year when we was there and she said I just come from the six month checkup and they told me they said your kidneys are so good we're going to take it off of your chart that you ever had kidney trouble Hallelujah so good that they took it off my chart yeah here's the sister right here you can see she's got the Walker she said it's so good they took it off the chart that I ever even had kidney trouble you remember the story of the sister in France anybody ever remember that alley you do I guess anybody else remember that story you do we won't tell it then anybody else don't remember it want me to tell it you don't want me to tell it you do want me to tell I ain't gonna tell it I'm just kidding I was in France and so I had preached this little message that the lord gave me on for the sake of one what God would do for one so because you see if he was the only young person ever lost he would went to Calvary for you that's that's how much he loves you if he was the only person in the history of humanity that was lost he would have went to Calvary for you if he was the only person in the history of all Humanity that was ever sick he would have took every stripe for your healing that's just how much he loves you so I took this thought for the sake of one and when the service was over this sister was sitting on the second row and she's on a cane her hair was real short big old earrings she had on pants and so I just stepped down off the platform I was actually leaving going out and I just stepped down and I went over where she was and she had her hand like this on her cane she's standing there and I just laid my hand on her hand and I said father I said this poor woman I said she don't understand the word I'm saying I don't speak French I barely speak English and I said this poor woman bit on this cane probably had a rough life and I said father if I can find favor I said take take her off this candy she can just enjoy the rest of her life without this cane so I just went on said amen and went on on the way home Brother David Myers he was the guy sitting up here on the platform with us during the dedication service on the way home Brother David said what what did you say to her so I told him what we said well the next morning she comes to church and she wants to testify and she said I got up this morning and I didn't need my cane the Lord took her off of the cane and I was there in February before the pandemic destroyed the world and I saw her and since that time she's repented been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ received the Holy Ghost she had on a skirt her hair was way down her back and she was vacuuming the church I said Lord have mercy every time I see you you're getting younger and younger she went from a cane to vacuuming the church because that's the kind of God that we serve and I was in Poland and I was leaving the meeting in Poland and there's a man standing there and he was on a walker and it reminded me of the sister in France and so I just went over I was on the way out I went over and never even spoke to the man I just laid my hand on his back and asked I said father you're the god that took that sister off the king there in France you can take this brother off a walker in Poland and just went on when I got home about three weeks later brother Robert Fisher sent me a text he said brother said that man you prayed for in Poland that was on that Walker I said yeah I said how did you know I'd done that because I didn't it wasn't a public show I just went out I said how did you know that he said because he contacted me and said he don't need his walker anymore that same God that done it in France done it in Poland and the same God had done it in Poland done it for my sister sitting right back there about two weeks ago I guess it was I was sitting over here and at the end of the service I felt led to go pray for her and I just got up went over sat down beside her and prayed for my sister and she came over at the house yesterday she's walking really good she's not been on her cane now for over two weeks because the same God that done it in France done it in Poland can do it in America he's God sister Vera Frost in Missouri where you at buddy I know where my buddy at back there from Missouri there he is you remember Sister Bear don't you buddy she's paralyzed on the right side of her body you might have been too young to remember I don't know you're just a young fella but and she come up like this she said I want you to pray for me I've had a stroke her mouth was pulled up towards your ear and so we prayed for her and she turned around and Drug herself off just like she came up and the devil spoke to me and said see there she came up for help and you couldn't help her and I said I'm not the Healer Jesus Christ is the Healer he told me to lay hands on the sick I did my part the rest it's up to him ain't that right a year later I was back down there this woman come in carrying deer meat went out come in carrying green beans and so she came by me and I said do I know you she said yes you do I said was you here last year when I preached he said yes I was I said wasn't you paralyzed on your right side she said yes I was I said you're doing real good now she said yes I am oh God it's so good I've done it out in Missouri brother Leon Wilson he's going to glory and his sister Kathleen that comes to our church it was her her husband he's gone to Glory now but brother Leon from Mississippi had a real heavy Mississippi accident and I was down there preaching one time he said yeah it says uh we're gonna get our brother walled up here to preach he said if brother wall the king preach we're going to set him down get somebody who can oh mercy I was in there preaching one time and they was calling for a major snowstorm to come in but the the church do you remember the church but you remember at church it had no windows it was just a block building there's a back door that you come in and on the front up here on the side was a door and so they didn't have no study so you pull your car up and set the car and when it was time to preach Ronnie cluster would open the door in motion for you to come in and that's how you waited for the service so I was sitting on the platform where the Leon gets up he goes uh yeah I said uh they call him for major snowstorm but come here after a while I said but we don't have none of that around here so we're gonna have us some church tonight he said brother why would you preach I said brother Leon if you have church I'll preach he said yes sir he said we're having us some church tonight he said Ronnie open out their door well Ronnie cluster got up opened the door the snow was coming in like this it was already about an inch and a half on the ground but Leon goes uh church is canceled tonight oh mercy his face went right out the door with the snow but if you put up that next picture all right good night I was in Ohio this sister came up with this thing hanging off of her head she wanted prayer and when I laid my hands on her head like this I just come up and it was just hanging off of this ear and I just and when I put it made me so sick I thought I was going to vomit it just made me sick at my stomach but that woman's Faith was so great I thought man we are going to have some church because this thing's fixing to follow up on the floor we're having some church tonight will I prayed for her she turned around walked off he was still there I couldn't understand it I thought it wasn't me it was her it was her faith brother Robbie it was so strong I thought why did that not fall off in the floor so I was talking to David Siler my buddy you know I was talking to David I said David I do not understand why that didn't it should have fell off in the floor well I guess the Lord heard me whining because I get a text from Brother Wayne Lawson said I'm up in Ohio and said there's a sister up here said do you know brother Darryl he said yeah I know brother Daryl she said will you text him and tell him that four days after he prayed for me I was walking through the house and the tumor fell off in the floor so the next picture Mikey you see sometimes it'll happen when you think it happened but it'll happen in God's time and when it happens in God's time it's always right on time so if you pray little brother Daryl I prayed nothing happened never doubt your ability to pray the greatest weapon placed in any of our hands is the weapon of prayer it's more powerful than an atomic bomb is that not true he gave Moses a stick he gave David a slingshot he gave Samson a Jawbone but he gave you the name of Jesus in prayer and when you hold that name in prayer every devil is subject to you they're under your feet look at your feet tonight we're the only preached on their feet last night you know when I was thinking when he preached on that no matter how ugly my feet is every Devil's still underneath my ugly feet oh well praise the Lord I was in Arizona Cottonwood Arizona his sister there had a tumor on her chest and she had been putting this side on it and so that night I was just doing like I'm doing right now I took a little thought on a witness of his majesty and was just sharing some of the things I seen the Lord do it was only just a Wednesday night service and she was she never came up for prayer she never asked for prayer she was just sitting in the service rejoicing over what the Lord did she goes home takes her blouse off to put some ointment on this tumor that was on her chest and it completely disappeared during the service no scar no scab no nothing it was completely gone she didn't even know what happened when she went took her blouse off to put ointment on it it was gone tumor disappeared during the service I was in Oklahoma there's a young girl there had a growth on the side of her leg and she came up for prayer and I told her I said when the Lord heals you you tell your pastor to let me know well she said as soon as the saints of God prayed for her she goes and checks and the tumor was half the size it was and three weeks later I get a text from her pastor and the sister said it was completely gone off her leg there's a sister Nicaragua had cancer and they wanted her to start her treatment right away but she said I want a brother to pray for me before I start my treatment so I was down there in January I've been to Nicaragua 15 times and I was down there in January and she came up for prayer and she told me she said I'm ate up with cancer they want to start treatment she said but I wouldn't let them start it until you prayed for me said will you pray for me I said yes ma'am we'll pray for you we prayed for the sister just kneeling at the altar she goes back to the doctor she's alive today not one sign of Cancer he's so good it's just that simple faith just that simple faith pieces of prayer cloth I shared the one about the thread off of brother Brennan's suit but a brother from down in Arizona sent me some prayer cloths that brother Benham had prayed over and so I was going down to brother I believe his brother Tim Pruitt's to preach and I just reached up I had him in a bowl and I reached up and grabbed a couple of them put them in my pocket took them with me because I thought you know I'll get a chance maybe we pray for the sick we'll just take them with us and so I'll get to the room I go out to preach that night I just take these things I'd never even looked at them just put them in my pocket well this sister came up that was real heavy with child and she said brother Daryl she said she said I'm pregnant and I said yes ma'am kind of hard not to see that and she said they tell me my baby's dead and she said I was wanting a girl said they tell me I'm going to have a boy but they tell me my baby's dead and she said you know I was really wanting to go but right now I just want my baby to be healthy I said I gotta go from some tests if I remember it right it's been a few years ago and I told her I said sis I said I've got a prayer called that brother Brandon prayed over and I took it out of my hand and I just put it in her hand like this and prayed with her I said now when you have that baby and it's healthy you send that prayer cloth back to me as a testimony of what the Lord did for you well I was down there a few years later and this sister come up she said you remember me I said yeah I remember you she said brother Daryl she said I had a healthy baby I said well praise the Lord she said but do you know you said you remember said they was telling me it was a boy I was wanting a girl but I said I'll just I just wanted to be healthy I said yeah I remember that she said she said brother she said I had a beautiful healthy little girl and I said well praise the Lord she said but do you know you gave me this and she held out her hand it was a pink prayer cloth oh Lord have mercy who could do that but God of pink prayer cloth I got an envelope in the mail the other day from Canada and opened it up and in it was a handkerchief I said brother Daryl I'm completely healed said here's your handkerchief back because you told me to send it back to you I do not have a clue who it is I give so many I give so many handkerchiefs away that's what my family buys me handkerchief for Christmas I think I'll start giving bicycles or something well this is being streamed ain't it oh I'm in trouble amen I just I just didn't want to preach to it and I just kind of wanted just to relax you know and just just witness to some of the things that we see the Lord do torn rotator cuffs and shoulder trouble I was down in Oklahoma this woman had tennis elbow and I was preaching a little message the lord gave me on the healer is passing by and at the end of the service this sister she's everybody was clapping their hands and singing and she started clapping her hands and when she did she started yelling I'm Healed and she said I couldn't do that and I'm doing that and as soon as she done that it's just like the door opened up and this one's got healed and that one got healed and that one got healed because she broke that barrier and when that barrier's broke you can step into whatever you have need of I was over in North Carolina Scott Smith's mother had a torn rotator cuff she couldn't raise her arm and right at the end of the service I think also in that same I think I was preaching that same message the healers passing by but in towards the end of that service the spirit Lord just kind of fell among the people well I turned the service over I went into the study and I was sitting in the study wiping the sweat off my face and all of a sudden I heard a roar out there and I thought what in the world and brother Scott come in he said brother Daryl I said God Tell My Mama of a torn rotator cuff says she's got both hands up praising God okay amen I would just oh there are just so many healings in the eyes the sister in Pennsylvania I know you heard me tell this many times sister Betty had glaucoma it's so bad that the lights of the church hurt her eyes she had to wear sunglasses sitting in church and so she came up for prayer and she said I gotta go see an eye specialist on Monday about my eyes and she said but would you pray and I said sure we'll pray so me and the Saints pray for sister Betty she goes back to the doctor on Monday the eye specialist and he examined her eyes and he told sister Betty he said whoever whoever sent you here needs their eyes examined he said there's nothing wrong with your eyes he healed her of glaucoma well I was sharing that testimony up in Oregon and a man sitting in the back with cataracts and he said Lord if you can heal sister Betty's eyes you can heal my eyes and the cataracts fell off of his eyes sitting at the back of the service he got up and testified I can see he said everything was real milky now it's clear so I was over in New York City brother Evan carrion and I was sharing what the Lord did for Jessica you know Jessica was blind and the doctor said she'd never see again but the Lord opened her eyes and now she sees better than me and so I was sharing the testimony of what the Lord did for Jessica and the man was down in Florida streaming the service and he I think he had glaucoma at his eyes but he stood up in the living room and said Lord if you could heal Jessica's eyes you can heal my eyes he goes back to the doctor gave him a clean bill of health on his eyes in that same service as a Drug Act was streaming the service and when I had the Saints lay hands on one another for prayer he stood up in his living room a drug addict and God delivered him of Meth that's the kind of God that we serve I was in Ohio preaching we had a just a prayer line developed didn't call for a prayer line it just kind of developed and so these people was coming up for prayer and so this sister came up and I said do you need something from the Lord and she said no I come to testify she said I was at home streaming and said the Lord Heal Me and she got in her car drove all the way to church came up to the Altar and testified over healing and then proceeded to shout the church down sitting at home watching the service and God healed her she said I didn't come for prayer I'd come to testify amen I seen on the Facebook of this woman whose little boy had diagnosed with asthma six-year-old and they told her he was going to have to be on oxygen and she said I don't want my little boy to be on the oxygen I want him to play you know and that just kind of touched me I thought poor little fella so I just typed out a prayer I said father this little fella wants to just be normal and enjoy I said just take that up oxygen away from it you don't have to wear it and he can just be normal and I just Tapped Out The Prayer it's a little while I get a reply from this sister said thank you brother dial for praying for my little boy he said you prayed for my husband when he's a little boy down here in Arkansas and said God healed him of asthma and said if God healed him a basma I know he can take care of my little son so I was down in a meeting in Arkansas and this man and his boy come walking in to the to the study said you remember me and I said no sir I don't believe I do he said when I was a little boy said you prayed for me said the Lord Heal Me of asthma said this is my son that you prayed for on Facebook and he didn't have no oxygen amen heart disease that's down in Arkansas and a brother came up he grabbed me I heard bones I didn't even know I had pop he about killed me and he was he said brother I said two years ago when he was down here he said I had a heart disease I said they told me I was in heart failure head put me on all this medicine said I came up for prayer and he said I went back to the doctor brother Daryl and they said said your heart is so good he said they took me off all my heart mess and said I don't even take heart medicine anymore and he said I just wanted to come and thank you and I thought Lord handshake would have been good about squeeze the breath out of me but you remember Tony Burdette he was here during the dedication service he's talking about the Lord touching his heart I was in that service when that happened and brother Tony came up and he was telling me that the doctor said he couldn't live without that medicine but he wanted to trust God for his healing he said I'm not taking any more of it and I said well I'll agree with you brother Tony we'll just pray together and that's been however many years ago I don't know how long it's been but he's never took any more heart medicine and I was sharing it with him because up in Virginia there's a man came up I didn't even know where he even got the medicine but he had it in his hand like this and he said it on the on the platform like that and he said the doctor says if I don't take this I'm going to die he said but I'm giving it to Jesus it kind of made me a little bit nervous I thought well you know what this guy's just called up an emotion or something but I thought well you know if it's got that kind of faith I'm not going to I'm going to stand with him man never took another to the day he died he never took another pill for his heart so and I was telling that to brother Tony down in South Carolina about the man up in Virginia and brother Tony's testifying up here the other day you know he said brother Charles probably said it different places but the Lord healed brother Tony of heart disease I think it was an enlarged heart if i remember right skin diseases y'all getting tired you want me quit skin diseases there's a little brother from Wisconsin I had this stuff all over his arms is that the byc camp a few years ago and I come down off the platform and went back where he was and just laid hands on him prayed for him by the time he left the camp he didn't have a sign it was just the Lord took it right off of him I was in the backfield working Brother Richard tester called me he said brother Daryl he said my great grandson I told it wrong before I told it as his grandson it was actually I talked to him the other day and he was telling me it was actually his great grandson he had an incurable skin disease had been to four different doctors and every one of them said the boy will never be well he just got this he said he was he called me said you got a rash from the top of his head to the soles of his feet and he said will you pray I said sure buddy we'll just agree together so I was at the backfield I just stopped we prayed over the phone a few days later I was back there still working in that backfield brother tester called and said hello he goes brother put up the picture brother Michael this is the boy today that's what our God can do there is nothing but our God I can't do Hallelujah amen isn't he wonderful there's another brother at the byc had warts all between his fingers and he came up for prayer and all the warts between his fingers just went away so if you got skin trouble tonight if you can do it at the byc he was at the byc one year and I got done preaching man I went over behind the organ and I set my Bible down like this because she was so hot I thought it was going to die I went down to the concession stand before the service I drank a whole quart of Gatorade took another one with me to the pulpit because it was so hot that night and I I was just dizzy and I went over behind and I set my Bible down like that when I did this girl was looking at me right in the face and a voice said pray for her so I looked up and I thought where is she at so I'll come back around the organ and I was just all these faces looking I thought where and I was looking trying to see her and when I was looking like that and she walked right up in front of me and stood right there in front of me and I told her I said sis God is my witness he told me right over there behind that organ to pray for you and she just melted into the carpet isn't it isn't he wonderful you know when Jessica was hurt real bad and we was in the hospital room that night and Cheryl was crying I was crying and you know Cheryl's Daddy was dead and little Rachel had been killed and sure said I've lost my daddy and I've lost my sister and she said if I lose my baby she said I'll just die and I knew that I just her heart was just broke and I just turned to the wall and I said Lord I said what are you doing I said you're taking everything away from me and I looked and I saw me and Cheryl and Jessica walk out on the platform at Happy Valley and Jessica had on the new dress and right before we came home from the hospital sister Becky Johnson came down and brought this new not doing anything brought this new dress and when we came out on the platform what I had saw weeks before in a hospital room become a reality when me and Cheryl and Jessica walked out on the platform and Jessica had on a new dress she thank you Lord thank you Lord amen amen as a young girl I didn't pray for this girl but I was just there when it happened she was a cutter she had all these scars where she'd cut herself and in this meeting she wanted to Worship the Lord but she was kind of ashamed of the scars she said Lord I Want To Worship You and I believe I'm telling it right just remember if it's a thumb she said I want to worship you but I'm ashamed of these scars and said a boy said lift your arms and give me praise and when that young girl raised her arms to worship Jesus the scars disappeared off of her arms you got scars in your life he can take them away from you he can take them away from you amen I told you about brother Jonas Hildebrandt many times Sister Christine over in Romania amen I was in Nicaragua me and Brother David solid was in this meeting together he's having a prayer line this man came through the prayer line like this right here this way this is the way he walked and when he'd go to shake your hand he'd have to look up like this and Shake Your Hand he'd been there all week in the meetings he was actually a preacher but he walked like that he couldn't raise up he blew his back out laying brick and he walked around like this right here and he'd look up at you and shake you he came through the prayer line and when that man got to the end of the prayer line he was standing straight up and he shouted that place to the ground and I tell you when you have walked like this for so many years and then God let you walk like this you got something to shout about you've got something to be happy about it oh my amen I'll hurry put that other picture this young couple couldn't have a baby and I was in Nicaragua and they come up to me and asked me if I would pray that they could have a child what the Lord had did for for us with Jessica and gave us back you know the lord gave Jessica back to us and so they asked if we would pray so we was there of Danny Torres interpreted for me and we prayed for that couple and here not long ago I got this picture from him the prayer has been answered that's their little baby oh my God so when they come up for prayer said we want to have a baby I said how many you want I said if you want to ask God you might as well get what you want you know they said we'll start with one I was in Arkansas went down with a woman come up and wanted a car she wanted the car so she could come to church and she said would you pray that the Lord would give me a car so I can come to church and I said well that's an honorable request you know you don't you don't want a car so you can go to the race horse track and bet on horses you know and so she said yeah I just want the Lord to give me a car so I can come to church and I said well what color do you want she goes I said well if you're going to ask the Lord for a car you might as well get the color you want I mean you know why ask for a car and get something you don't like you know so she goes uh blue I said well we'll just pray Lord to give you blue I don't know if she ever got it or not but that look of her face was like this guy's crazy amen remember David Salah was in a prayer line down in Arizona this man came walking up he just come walking up and I said you believe God will give you the salvation of your children he said that's what I'm here for I said we'll just go right on through there thanking the lord for it it's been several years ago not long ago I got a I got a a call from him text or whatever you know said well Daryl said my last child's come in said they're all in now serving the lord he'll give you children when you can't have them they'll give you children when they're out in the world I was in a prayer line and this sister came in I'll stop there but she came in and she said brother said I've got a son and we had it falling out said we've not spoke to each other in years I said I've got a little granddaughter that I've never seen because me and my son don't talk to one another and she said I'm getting old and she said I will just what a joy my granddaughter she said would you pray that God will reconcile my family so I can know my granddaughter I said sure says we'll just pray I said and when you family reconcile them I said you let me know what the Lord did for you I think it was two years I get a letter in the mail from a sister and she said brother Daryl she said my son's wife called me and invited me to my son's birthday party I think it's his 50th birthday or something like that said he invited me to the party she said I went there said I've been reconciled said I've met my granddaughter she said God is just so good well I was down preaching somewhere and I shared that testimony and a man came up with his wife at the end of the service he said brother I said I got a son we hadn't heard from him in years he said but if God can do that for that sister he can do it for my family he said would you pray that my family would be reconciled I said sure we'll just pray we'll just believe together and we prayed it was like on a Saturday night that Tuesday the following Tuesday his son called him they was reconciled the boy returned to Christ gave his heart back to the Lord and the last I heard he was leading singing in his daddy's Church it's just the kind of God that we serve and the last thing I want to share with you is Our God can raise the Dead I was in Pennsylvania it's been several years ago Andrew Glover was in the meeting with me and just as I read the scripture there's a guy sitting right over here about where the sister's sitting and he just goes like that and from the pulpit I could see the watch of his eyes his wife jumped up started screaming just hysterical just weeping you know just sitting right behind him was the pastor and behind him was a deacon they got up and he come and just put his arms on the because he was just slumped back like that he was just down and so he's just kind of holding him in the seat but nobody of course the wife I mean that's to be expected but the rest of the people they never kind of sitting like you are just kind of just sitting you know and they just started singing oh how I love Jesus or just just a soft song nobody got excited they didn't even call 9-1-1 and they was just singing and so from where I was I could see the whites of his eyes and so we just prayed said everybody said just bow your head we'll just pray and we just prayed a prayer the Saints was praying the prayer and we said amen he was just laying like it he goes he goes just like this right here he goes and he just raised up he just go he was just like that and he goes that's it brother Jack you okay he said let's go buddy so we went on we had Church and remember just a few weeks ago right here in this Auditorium what the Lord did for sister Ruth Garland sitting right back there he's the same yesterday today and forever and the same God that saved that Apache is the same God that gave sister Ruth back to us is the same God who gave Jessica back to me is the same God who can meet every need that you have tonight that's just the kind of God that we serve and I've just seen him do so many things there's nothing that our God can't do and so now you've heard me now just for a few minutes I want to hear you does anybody here have a testimony because I know sometimes you have these meetings you know and and the preacher always gets to talk and you guys just sit there but this is your chance tonight okay y'all go get a drink of water there's gonna be a long one oh my Lord I was waiting for you to ask um this has been four or five years ago a lot of you don't know this a lot of you don't know me that well I'm not from here some of you are closer to me than others but I I was a very very sick person for a large chunk of my life I'm gonna pull myself together a little bit um so I was diagnosed with what's called primary immune deficiency and for let's see I wasn't planning on talking so let me get the details right six or seven years of my life I I went once a month and got an infusion for four hours to help boost my immune system I was in and out of the hospital once a month once every three months for four or five years of my life um and you know and and it was just part I just accepted it you know I was like this is what I've got I'm gonna live like this forever and uh we were in Happy Valley um I had started coming down here and I think I mean I also been dating a year or so or maybe two years and brother Daryl was preaching and uh he said you know everyone he pulled the whole congregation to the altar everyone I mean we all some of you may remember but we were all up close and I just raised my hands I said Lord I don't want to live like this forever and and um and he touched me that day and I and I went I went back home I had to go to school and kept doing the infusion thing and when I came back down here I switched doctors and he uh you know I went to my doctor's appointment I told him my diagnosis I told him about my life and my history and he said well you know I don't let's just let's just take a month off and see how you do I said okay let's do that sure I was like this guy's crazy I'm gonna be sick I'm gonna be in the hospital I've been through this we've tried this my whole life you know I know and it's been three or four years now not a single one haven't been in the hospital a single time lord touched me and my life has been forever changed and I'm I'm up here now and I was thinking about this the whole time he was talking I've never told my family knows and a few of my close friends but I've been scared to testify because you know you get up and you testify and the devil starts coming at you and I've been scared this whole time so I'm not going to say anything because I'm scared I'm scared that the devil come after me and and uh you know I haven't told Daryl to tell that he knows it but I'm here tonight to give him a black eye and tell him that if the Lord's done something for you you need to tell it and you need to testify and I'm ashamed of waiting this long to get up and tell people but he's a Healer he's my healer and he has been and he's changed my life forever anyone else come on up here little brother God bless you appreciate you uh also was not planning on talking so if things get you know confusing man uh some of you may know this um I haven't been very secretive about it necessarily but I also don't I don't throw it out there for many people to know because whenever you start opening yourself up to people you know to the wrong people you can you can get hurt uh about two three years ago I struggled with horrible horrible just mental battles just depression anxiety just literally anything and everything you could think of um and during that time I mean I'm sure people Knew by I mean the way I acted or the way I was you know presenting myself or whatever but it wasn't like a communicative thing like people didn't know brother Daryl knew dad dad had to talk to him about it brother Daryl um gave dad a uh a prayer cloth and I I didn't know that he had given given to the prayer cloth and dad had pinned it on my bed underneath my my bed sheet and even before then I talked about it Aaron he'd given me one of his one of his his handkerchiefs to bring it back to me whenever you're healed um well I hung on to it for a while you know and then you know you have moments in church you have you know experiences and I was like oh for sure I felt how I was broken you know I'd broken through and part of me feels like I had but I let the devil get to me again and I just got defeated but in that time I came back to the other day I was like you know here's your handkerchief I've been delivered he was like hang on to it and I was part of me was like okay wonder wonder why he did that he was like you know if if the dev over comes back you can have that as a testimony and you know in my head I was like well I wouldn't need it for that I feel like I'm delivered well came back harder than ever which you know I'm not going to get into all the all the all the Gory details but it got bad and then I realized why I still had that handkerchief and why why he told me to hang on to it um then Virginia meetings rolled around is 20 20. 2021 I think and I've been praying that whole that whole time I didn't want to go to those meetings I was just like uh you know I was caught up in stuff School whatever um but Saturday night we had that prayer line and never in my life have I experienced anything like that the the spirit that dropped down there in those meetings was you could almost see it you could feel it it was a a pressure it was it was awesome and I came out that prayer line and you know because the the tent's out in the middle of a field there was you know people all around people that came out to prayer line everybody was praying everybody was you know just just worshiping and they they put me down on a chair and I was I was just sitting there and I was praying I was thinking I don't feel nothing I don't feel any different I don't because whenever you get in a state like that without knowing it consciously you worship that demon that's that's held on to your life because you start thinking who am I without this because it becomes your identity and I didn't realize I was hanging on to it and I was I was sitting there and a voice spoke to me and it was like do you want to be healed and in my head I was like I mean I thought I was well what it was all it was all a mess everything was because two worlds were meeting in that moment and that darkness that had been in my life for years since I was 12 years old 11 years old it was it was clashing and I was I was all confused and the voice said you're healed say it and I whispered and I was like I'm Healed nothing happened I said I'm Healed and then I yelled out I'm Healed and the second I said that I physically felt it break I felt it break off my body um I've never been the same since ever it never been the same never struggled with any any thoughts like that I became a totally a totally new person and that that handkerchiefs that brother Dale gave me anytime the Lord does something for me in my life I write it down on that on the handkerchief and I put the date beside it and a year later at the same meetings I got the Holy Ghost so that's my testimony praise the Lord you know brother Jonas Hildebrand up in Canada he had so many sinus infections they had so many surgeries they cut the nerves out of his couldn't smell so he came through a prayer line up here it's February 20 I believe it was and I gave him a handkerchief and I said when the Lord heals you you send it back to me it's a testimony of what the Lord did for you I've just seen the Lord use that so many times well I was in a hotel room and I was in bed and my phone goes so I looked at it and it was brother Jonas he said are you asleep I said no not now so I said can I call you I said sure sure so he called me said well Daryl he said I don't know where you're at don't even know what time it is where you're at he said but I was coming home from church tonight he said guess what I said what buddy he said I smell the skunk I believe that's right when the Lord touches you even the skunk smells good I remember another time a prayer cloth I was in Virginia and this sister came through the prayer line and she said I don't I'm tired of going to church by myself said my husband won't come to church with me and I said will you take his handkerchief you put it under the mattress with inside he sleeps on and when he starts coming to church you send it back to me and so several years later I was up there and she come up to me with that handkerchief and she said I'm going to give this back to you said I said yeah I remember she said oh there's my husband I said not only is he coming to church and now he's a deacon in the church just the kind of God that we serve he's just he's just wonderful I was in Nicaragua one time and I was too handkerchief and tore it off and give it to the kids piece of it and I said when the Lord heals you you give it to Mike sieber to send back to me and you know I knew they wouldn't send it back to me but it's just something that for your faith to Anchor you know and so I was turning it off giving it to him he's coming through the prayer line and oh man we prayed for so many and before the prayer line was over the kids that was in the front of the line had got back in the line and was giving me pieces of the handkerchief back the Lord had already healed them before they ever left the building and that same service that night I was coming out they was helping me out of the building I'll never forget this I was talking about salvation but there's a young guy he wasn't even a part of he's actually part of the camp he worked there he wasn't part of our young people and he was standing at the back door and I was going on and I just looked at him he's looking at me and I said do you need something from Jesus he's just he just fell on his knees and repented and gave his heart to the Lord and his girlfriend was also there and she went to the altar that night and the Lord saved both of them in that meeting that night and he's just wonderful I didn't mean to get emotional but it just touches my heart anybody else come on up here sis to bear with me I'm gonna cry um I maybe start of the year I dealt with a lot of anxiety and depression and it wouldn't go away I tried to go to church and I went up for prayer many times and nothing happened so in Louisiana camp this year my I I was really searching for the Holy Ghost and I wanted it so bad and I kept praying and praying and praying and I received it and I got back home and Satan blinded me so much that I didn't I didn't even think I had any more and I was blind um whether Andrew Spencer when he came for our meetings preached and he said and if you have if you know you had the Holy Ghost and I didn't know I sat there and I was like do I stand or do I sit down and he was praying for people it took me a long time to come up here and get prayed for and I finally I finally did it told them and I said I don't I don't know I received it at Louisiana and I don't know if I have it I really don't and he looked at me and he said I can see it all over use this and that's when I knew and now I feel nothing defeat me or God and now that I know that I have the Holy Ghost thank you there's nothing like knowing that you know that you know amen anybody else this is your chance some of you've been wanting to preach this is yours I knew it come on up here buddy praise the Lord that's the way I'm going to look in the Millennium right there it's just something small um I think it was like form four or three months ago I had pain on my right side and um like right here I would push down and I was like oh what what is this like every time I bend over at work it would hurt and I'd be like oh man like I really don't want to go doctor you know I don't want to find out you know I have liver problems or something so I just kept putting it off putting it off and I kept praying and claiming my healing and then we have the special meetings and I went up to get prayed for and I was like Lord please take this away I don't I don't want I don't want to have this pain you know I don't want to know what it is I was actually pretty scared and then weeks passed by and before I knew it I totally forgot about it and then when we were you were pre you were talking and um talking about the testimonies and the healing I just reached over I was like you know what I didn't I haven't really felt it in a while and it doesn't hurt no more and after mark telling his testimony just so I was like you know I wasn't planned on speaking so but you know it just encourages just to let you know if when someone else has testimony it encourages you encourage me and I'm sure it's encouraged a lot of a lot of YouTube so so praise God for healing and just yeah amen [Applause] it's wonderful what the Lord can do in it amen come on up here sister from Canada so this isn't my testimony but I'm sharing it because I need it um but last year at our church camp um we had a testimony night at the end of the service and one of my friends she's had stomach issues for as long as I've known her um gluten dairy nothing like and she always had a struggle with it you know come to Youth and she had to have her special meals and and it was the last night of camp and God moved in such a special way of that camp but I remember I was up there and praying with some of the young girls and and she came and she came up and got prayed for and and she turned to me and everybody else was you know and having their moments and she turned to me and she goes Chloe I'm Healed and it was like I looked at her and I knew I knew she was healed and and we were so encouraged by it and the next morning we went and I was the only one me and her were the only ones that knew what had happened and we went for breakfast and um right as we're in the line a girl one another one of her friends comes up to her and she goes I had a dream last night and and my dream you ate a sack of Pancakes and you were fine and that breakfast that morning was pancakes and she went and she took a full stack and some friends told her you know maybe you should try just one pancake and see how you feel and she said nope God healed me and she ate the whole stack the biggest stock I've ever seen and I know I I have a lot of stomach issues and it's been something that I've been struggling a lot especially since being down here um and I know that if God did it for her he can do it for me so I'm just claiming it here here a few years ago I was up at the byc camp and we had prayed for so many kids and I was going up the aisle leaving just really tired and and this girl stepped out and she said I'm uh bulimic is that where you eat your food and throw it back up is that she said I'm I'm a bulimic she said I won't I don't want to be like that no more so we prayed and I told her I thought about that when she said that I told her I said sis I said now go get you a hamburger and eat it well when I got back to the room kind of come to myself a little bit you know I thought kind of scared me bro Paul because I thought wow maybe you know maybe this girl maybe she's not had food on her stomach because she throwed it up for so long maybe I maybe she should have had soup first or something you know I I thought oh Lord have mercy I hope I hadn't told that girl something something wrong you know and she and so all that night I just I was just praying I said Lord you know Lord I just was trying to be a help you know and so the next morning when we went for breakfast I was looking for her make sure make sure she's alive you know and so I saw her and she come running up to me and I said how you doing sis she said bro Daryl said not only did I eat one hamburger she said I ate two I said well praise the Lord for two hamburgers but that you're right when the Lord heals you you don't have to have one pancake you can have them all amen amen God is so good anybody else said it's getting late one time we need to come on up here sis probably like so many of you all one of my biggest troubles in life has been depression and anxiety and one of the biggest things that I've thought is always that nobody cares about me and I could just disappear tomorrow and why would it matter and it created a lot of bitterness in me and a lot of hatred towards people for many many years and just a few months ago I can remember it was it was really bad for me and I was sitting here in church and I saw somebody else come up and get prayed for and she had you know a moment with the Lord and when she did I just saw all these group of ladies go and pray for and I I leaned over to somebody and I said you know if that happened to me nobody nobody would come pray for me nobody would care and just a few weeks later I went up for prayer and um the Lord really moved for me in a way he never had before and as I know at the altar of just crying and praying I felt the hand on my back and then I felt another one and another one and another one and I realized a group of girls said I'll come and they had prayed for me and it made me realize people to care about me and I walked up and I haven't felt that bitterness or that hatred toward people anymore I just love all of you and I'm just so blessed to be a part just thank you all [Applause] you know one thing I learned if you're if you ever felt led to pray for someone you should go do that because you know program talked about the mother who had the child and she didn't have a seat and this woman got up to give her her seat and she just felt compelled to pray for the baby but she thought you know the woman to get a prayer card and brother Brennan will pray for the baby and God will heal it and but she could not get that up so she asked she said do you mind if I pray for your child and she said well sure so she prayed and so she went up in the balcony and sat down and so sure enough that woman got a prayer card she got called come to the platform with that baby and the brother Brennan went to pray for the baby and he said the baby's already healed he said the woman up there in the balcony and the planted dress prayed for the baby and brother Brennan went on to say he said her being a mother could have more compassion on that child than I could and so you realize here's to the prophet of God with the ability to discern but God never used him to pray for that baby he used that woman and so and that's something I've always tried to do is be if I feel led to go pray for somebody and and just go pray for him and I don't know how many times that people people's told me said I was sitting here praying they said Lord if you can hear my prayer let brother Daryl come and pray for me and you know and so if you I just want to encourage you because we need one another's brother Donny preached last night we're a body it reminds me of a story during World War II and the Americans have been overrun by the Germans and they had to pull back and and anybody's ever been in the military you know that a Model A code of honor that we have among us as soldiers is we leave nobody behind no one's left behind but in this particular battle they've been overrun so fast they was pulled into the rear and they said leave the wounded we'll get them later but we've got to pull back we're going to lose every man if we don't well the sergeant turned around and this young boy had to sober up on his shoulders and the guy had been shot through the hips and the blood was pouring out of his body and this young boy he was much smaller than this man but he had him up like a fireman's ladder and he was trying to carry him and the sergeant yelled to this private and he said drop the man said we've got to retreat to the rear we'll get him later drop him let's go and so he turned back around and the boy was still struggling time to run with this man up on his shoulders and he told him the second time he said drop the man we've got to retreat to the rear we'll get him later we've got to go we've got to go drop him and so he he turned around again you know and he turned back around and the boy was still trying to carry the man and he said as your non-commissioned officer I'll order you drop that man he's too heavy for you you're he's too heavy to carry and the boy yelled back and he said Sarge He Ain't Heavy he's my brother he was trying to get his own brother off the battlefield and perhaps before they left his mama caught him in the kitchen said he said you know take care of Willie you know how he is he said oh mama I promise y'all maybe he's just trying to keep a promise to his mama but he said Sarge He Ain't Heavy he's my brother I promise you ain't none of you tonight He Ain't Heavy you're my brother you're my sister we're going to leave here together no one's Left Behind we're all going together and we're all going to sit at Daddy's house and it'll be all over one day and until then let us press on love one another encourage one another lift one another up leave no one behind don't draw a circle and get little clicks among you and leave this group out we all need each other all need each other I guess we we should close but I don't want to share One More Story with you I've told you about what the Lord did for other people I want to share One More Story my favorite scripture for years in the Bible has been Jeremiah 29 11. I know the thoughts I think towards you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not available to give you an expected end and it's just always kind of been a scripture that that means something to me and I was preaching the meeting in Arizona and I had to preach on a Saturday morning and I woke up and I had a demon headache I was so sick the sweat was literally coming off of my face and I had to preach and brother Dale Smith called me and he said hey you want to go get some coffee I said brother Dale I said I am so sick buddy I said I got to preach in a few minutes I said my head it feels like it's going to blow off of my shoulders he said well I'll pray for you and I said man I appreciate it so in a few minutes there's a knock out my door at the hotel and opened the door is brother Dale Smith and he had some coffee and a prayer and so I went and preached and I was so sick I put one leg in my pants and I had to lay on the bed and I just laid there forever to get up put the other one in so I got up and went and preached like that and so when I got to preaching the headache kind of went away and so when the service was over I felt pretty good compared to what I felt like and so they was having a big fish fry up in Flagstaff and I was done in a place called Cottonwood and so I told him I told the brother I said I'm just going to go lay down for a little bit and I said I'll come on back the wall and he said yeah come on up and when you feel like it get your shower and so I could feel the headache coming back but it wasn't as bad and so I laid down for a little bit and I got up and I was headed up to Flagstaff and I was going up a road called 89A if you're ever out that way take 89A it's a beautiful drive from Cottonwood up towards Sedona and so I got the wine and just going to be honest with you I just a big baby I got homesick I was so homesick I just couldn't stand it and I was going up the road by myself and I began to talk to the Lord and I said Lord I said do you even know I'm out here I said am I doing any good at all I said baby I should just go home and sit down I said I don't feel good that's about to see my family I said do you even know I'm here and I saw a sign that said Scenic knew one mile and I just I just loved Sedona I'll be happy I just love those anybody been out there those Red Rocks it's beautiful beautiful so I pulled in and I got out and there was a bench there and I got out of the car and I sat down on that bench and I began to whine again I said Lord do you even know my name I said you even know about here I just go home I just want to go home as I got done praying and I looked beside me this was laying beside me and at first I thought it was in the bench but when I touched it it moved and I picked it up and it said before I formed you in the womb I knew you and before you were born set you apart and I turned it over on the other side it was Jeremiah 29. I know the thoughts I think towards you and I looked at that coin but I thought He Knows My Name and I tell you tonight everyone else no matter how lonely you may feel that nobody knows you or nobody cares about you their sister talked about but I want you to know tonight we serve a god who knows your name who can give you encouragement when you need it the most when you can't even Encourage Yourself we serve a god who can put a coin on a bench to help a whiny preacher get through a Saturday afternoon and I tell you tonight young people he knows her name he knows everything about you can't can't we serve with Gods like that can't we love a God Like That who would give a whiny preacher a coin when he needed it the most that's the kind of God we serve do you love him can we just bow our heads up I appreciate you letting me come and share some things with you tonight while her head's about just a moment forgive me for being a baby amen just before we close I just wondered tonight you've heard the testimonies and some of the things that we've seen the Lord do some of the things I've never shared never will share but it's just but if you're here tonight and we've we talked about skin trouble we've talked about depression we've talked about heart trouble talked about diabetic trouble and if you're here tonight and maybe you have a need and maybe your particular need wasn't even mentioned as far as a testimony but surely you can see if God can take a rash off of a boy that you saw the picture just clean skin if God can take depression off of a sister then whatever your need would be tonight sister Caroline's sitting there tonight healed of cancer Jessica's sitting there tonight and blinded in a wheelchair and now look at her he's God he can do anything you know what he never asked for our money he never asked for our ability but all he ever ask us to do was to believe him if those can believe all things are possible and while you're here tonight if you if you have a need but you believe that the God who met these needs of these testimonies can meet your need tonight would you just raise your hand to him and say Lord I believe that tonight God bless those hands there God bless those hands there I bless that hand there yes if you're here no one looking around but if you're here and you've never accepted Jesus Christ as your savior I wonder if he would just slip you not to point you out I would never embarrass you but if you feel something pulling on your heart tonight do you just raise your hand say Lord would you remember me I keep remember that Apache man just before he passed you touched his heart would you raise your hand just yes God bless that Handler anyone else just before we yes God bless that hand God bless that hand Hallelujah God bless that hand right there yes isn't he wonderful amen God bless your hand he saw your hand isn't he wonderful there is no God like by God thank you Lord here's what I want us to do tonight I want you to lay hands on one another will you do that just reach over brother to brother sister to sister and then if you're out there by yourself just find somebody and just slip your hand over on them would you do that tonight would you be a conduit a channel that the spirit of the Lord could touch someone amen amen now that person you got your hand on might have been the one that raised her hand I don't want you to pray honestly you be that brother on the battlefield so he ain't heavy he's my brother that's my sister Heavenly Father we are so glad to call you father and Lord as we bow in your wonderful presence this evening these testimonies Lord the things that we've heard Lord has shared that we've seen you do for your people and Lord we know you're no respective persons father I know

come to him cool over them like a dove would coup to its mate God they may find that place Lord that the food of Calvary where the bleach of the blood of the Lord Jesus washes us and cleanses us Lord and brings us back into fellowship with you Lord Jesus father I give them to you tonight is the testimony of your goodness and your mercy and your grace Satan I speak to you you're a defeated foe my Lord defeated you at Calvary and you're nothing but a bluff and we rebuke you tonight in the name of Jesus and we charge you by the Lord God who gave us the authority of his word take your hands off of God's Property tonight for he said we could go free and every praise that our heart is to our God tonight because there is no God like our God Lord I ask you tonight may you touch these young people Lord these afflictions that they suffer with God May there be another testimony service and this time it won't be me Lord it'll be them telling what you did for them because we believed you

my back went out I laid in the floor of the hotel room put my feet up on the couch on ice I left that little thing at the door of the hotel with the door wouldn't shut so brother Giovanni could bring me food I ate my food laying on the floor of a hotel room because I wasn't able to sit up I had to preach that night brother Jewel said if you can't make it I'll take the service and then you can take my service two nights later so I text brother Donnie Texan Brothers ask him to pray so I text brother Joe I said brother Jewel I believe I'm going to preach tonight he texts back and he said ooh man he drove me to the meeting it was all I could do to get up into the study I laid in this floor of the study with my feet up on the couch so they called me to the pulpit sister Cindy hunt was in those meeting she's out there that year I come up the aisle I could hardly walk I got to hold the pulpit honestly my knuckles were white because I sprayed if I let go I'd fall in the floor [Music] but when I was laid up there I said Lord please don't make me stand in front of your people like this and I was standing there and greeting the people holding on to the pulpit and I felt a hand touched me in my back you know I always have mock trouble you've been around me enough to know whatever time I come to the woman I told somebody if I die and cross over and somebody hands me a microphone I didn't make it I went somewhere so when I felt this hand touched my back and I thought something's wrong with my mic so I turned around thinking it was a song leader and I thought that's funny there's no one behind me when I turn back around he's like two warm vials of water just run down my legs and it was over I was instantly healed every word of worship is due our God there is no God like our God thank you for your time I hope I've not kept you too Here Comes Michael he's going to testify God bless you all thank you for letting me be a part of your service [Applause] y'all can just be seated yesterday I'm probably one of the few that's here tonight that uh was part of this probably one of the best youth leaders that you could have and I look look around and some of the brothers and sisters that were in our youth group they've got positions now in the church they're Sunday school teachers I.T people all they do just stuff all over to the through the church and when you're this age you don't realize what God's doing to you and what if time lasts God forbid if it does the way the world is but if it does you're going to look at these times and look at your leaders like we look at brother Daryl and held you guys together our group the church was probably in the it was on the verge of splitting is almost on the verge of collapsing this church look what we are now but during that time it was the lowest probably lowest part I can remember but our youth group was on fire and I look back and to me that's what held our church together I mean going to brother Daryl's House our meetings had spiritual meetings and then we had non-spiritual meetings I mean we did it was fun you know I won't get into it but we had a good time and it binded us together as a group and you don't realize it this is what these brothers are trying to do with this this Divine you don't know how important it is just to get together and just play ball or sit and talk you know it keeps you guys together and during that was it brother Donnie come for a youth service brother Donnie came first time at our church was for one of our youth services and because we were so on fire and from there you know it's just history God's got it all in control but you know I just want you guys to know how important your your youth leaders is you know and that like I said you don't realize it right now but just try to give them you know a rose while you can you know because we're not young anymore you know I'm on the verge a couple years of what you want to say we just have the youth meet it's like when Wednesday night and the you've done everything they took up the offer and all the specials they opened the service and we had a well like brother Donnie came from one of the meetings so I was preaching at that I think it was like I was opening up the service someone sent me a prayer request to pray for the family of so and so passed away so it's okay okay and I was so nervous and Michael goes well what's that note and I said so-and-so wants prayer so Michael gets up and says so-and-so's moving prayer with the guy he's talking about [Music] the family wanted prayer but I told Michael the God wanted prayer and to pray for those that well the guy was dead that was his first miracle but I just wanted to say that to you guys you know how important this is right now you don't realize I really appreciate you know what brother Daryl did with their group and what brother Joe and brother Rob is doing now you know it's keeping you guys together and time last some of you'll be musicians you know maybe preachers sitting here Sunday school teachers to see some of them coming up so you know just it's more important than you think but I'll just tell my little testimony still remember I woke up on a Monday morning my back was hurting right here first thing I thought of was a kidney stone because I'd heard of them you know you know you do not want one and I went into work and brother Jimmy and Ron and all of them and I heard all through the day started getting worse that evening and by Tuesday I don't think I came into work and I was hurting pretty bad and brother Donnie was contacting me and I was hurting really bad he said what you need to do he said you need to make a concoction of asparagus and Coke together and drink it that will dissolve your kidney stone well I did that lo and behold after I drunk all that kidney stone had blocked I could not go to the bathroom so there I was dying and so I ended up going I think it was Wednesday going to the emergency room and they finally got me where I could go to the restroom but I went home and still had the stone and how many knows what a fetal position is I was on top of my bed in the fetal position I was in the floor in the fetal position yo you'd come in and nothing you could do and every time that stone would move it's just like it had a knife in your back and the next Thursday was Thanksgiving and we always go brother Daryl's for Thanksgiving to eat and we should have a real good time well the family went on I had to stay I had a Thursday Friday Saturday and still killing me Sunday it was still killing me and they went to church and I was screaming I was one of those God bless our streamers thank God for streamers because I was streaming and I was watching it on my phone laying in bed and at the end of service brother I said I just feel led to pray for brother Michael said he's at home got a kid who stole and he said that I grabbed my phone I still remember I grabbed my phone [Music] and the church prayed for me I got up out of the bed went to the restroom and passed the stone within five seconds after they prayed for me so you know after I'd had it for seven days that was my miracle that the Lord did for me but oh that just look at these services that you have a little little different you know it's it's molding you for the future for what future we have and just look at your your leaders a little different you know all four of us guys love you we're not here to you know for nothing these guys we love you guys and we put forth time and effort hoping we can help you guys in some way these guys more than me you know they're like Jose I'm a behind the scenes guy so I hope you know from this it'll help you see while we're having these meetings a little bit better and something a little more spiritual than just Gathering and playing ball so that's what I just want to say and I really just wanted to say I really appreciate brother Daryl I think we had one of the greatest youth leaders that for the time thank you for all the years that you give to us and it shows you know from the brothers and sisters you see the work that they're doing in the church and everything so it does pay off so God bless you thank you [Applause] y'all enjoy that tonight we are going to have brother Daryl back to preach so if he didn't get by he will be back but Michael Bailey is he keeps saying he's behind the scenes guy but I'm here to tell you things don't happen around here without the behind the scenes guy have to have him in fact Michael Bailey does more in his church than anybody the pastor will tell you that too does more in this church than anybody in this church you wouldn't we wouldn't have the things we the times we have together for one for Michael Bailey so he told me he's going to for the last 20 years he has kept telling me he's going to lay it down but it'll never happen me and brother Rob's going with him when he goes so but you know it's sometimes it's behind the scenes guys that have the hardest jobs so keep him in prayer and keep us in prayer keep brother Daryl a prayer keep yourself pray for one another encourage one another you know we're you're in this together we're here together and we testimonies they come up here going through anxiety depression and different things like brother Earl said just because you get delivered let me say it's not going to bring it back so if you get into that place in your life you go to someone that God's delivered let them help you build your faith Satan is going to bring things on you but God gave you a promise that he would deliver you so we're gonna let brother Jesse sing us out of here whatever you want to sing but God bless y'all for coming thank you very much we love you we're praying for you you know if you need anything anything at all you have mine brother Rob's number Michael Bailey brother Daryl it wouldn't mind at all to talk to you prayed with you and we love you that's I I don't
