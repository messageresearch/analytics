[50:27] Ephesians chap 1:5 having predestinated

[50:37] Jesus Christ to
[50:39] himself according to the good pleasure
[50:42] of his will this is why you're saved

[51:04] grace wherein he ha made us
[51:08] accepted in the
[51:10] Beloved chitu is the Greek word highly
[51:15] favored to make graceful
[51:19] charming
[51:21] lovely agreeable compass with favor to
[51:26] honor
[51:27] with
[51:29] blessings brother Andrew Glover had sent
[51:31] me this quote the other day I just
[51:34] thought it was so wonderful and I'll
[51:35] share it with you what a privilege that
[51:38] it is to
[51:41] know that we are
[51:43] accepted in the presence of
[51:46] God through the
[51:49] name of Jesus
[51:51] Christ may the Lord bless his word you
[51:54] may be seated
[52:02] there's not a doubt in my mind today
[52:04] that most everybody that's attended a
[52:07] religious
[52:09] service by now Europe is 7 to8 hours
[52:14] ahead of
[52:15] us and New Zealand Australia about 17
[52:19] hours ahead of us so it's already into
[52:22] their
[52:23] Monday all over the world people have
[52:26] attended
[52:28] synagogues chapels churches mosques all
[52:33] types of different places of
[52:36] worship to express their
[52:40] religion as I stood many years ago in
[52:44] Durban South Africa and I was invited by
[52:48] a brother Nami Nadu and he took me to a
[52:51] Hindu
[52:54] festival and I saw these people people
[52:56] as they were there to worship their gods
[53:00] and goddesses and the last count I had
[53:03] they had over
[53:05] 33 million of
[53:08] them so they gathered at this place and
[53:11] they were going to make a a journey to
[53:15] this very special Temple that was
[53:18] several hundred years
[53:19] old you've heard me tell it before years
[53:22] ago but they would have little uh
[53:26] buggies is the only way I know to
[53:28] describe them they would be 6 to 8 feet
[53:32] tall maybe six feet wide um and they
[53:36] would have different pictures of gods
[53:38] and goddesses some of you are familiar
[53:40] with Hinduism and some of their gods as
[53:44] the head of an elephant with a trunk and
[53:47] they take animals and different sorts of
[53:49] things that they worship and they would
[53:52] have different emblems on these uh buggy
[53:56] Chariot like looking things they were
[53:59] not drawn by horses they were not drawn
[54:02] by
[54:03] automobiles but actually they're going
[54:05] to be drawn by human
[54:08] beings so they have them all there and
[54:10] they're decorated and then I noticed
[54:12] that they was in little groups say 8 to
[54:16] 10 something like that and they'd be
[54:18] gathered around like in a circle around
[54:21] one individual standing in the middle of
[54:23] that they've got little symbols about
[54:26] this big and they're doing all that and
[54:28] clapping their hands and jumping and
[54:31] screaming and carrying on and this
[54:35] person is in the middle and all of a
[54:37] sudden they let out a scream of blood
[54:42] curdling
[54:45] scream and when they did they would
[54:47] start taking a long pin about this long
[54:52] taking that person's tongue and start
[54:55] weaving that PIN
[54:57] in their
[54:58] tongue they would take big grab hooks
[55:01] you all probably know what that is a big
[55:03] long grab hook and they would pull up
[55:06] the skin in their back and start putting
[55:11] that grab hook in their back that's what
[55:14] was going to pull this image this buggy
[55:18] of these gods and
[55:21] goddesses some of them whenever they
[55:23] hooked them up and they started pulling
[55:25] I saw them as those grab hooks were so
[55:29] sharp they pulled completely out of
[55:32] their backs and laid their backs wide
[55:35] open the blood streaming down their
[55:38] backs brother Nami knew some of those
[55:41] people there and there's one man as we
[55:43] watched this happen to him and as we
[55:45] walked by he waved at brother Nami and
[55:48] he said he's going to be in a lot of
[55:50] pain
[55:51] tomorrow because those who really become
[55:54] into this they become so entranced and
[55:59] entered into such a realm of demonic
[56:03] power they felt no pain now remember
[56:07] these are the people who will walk on
[56:09] hot coals that are white hot they will
[56:14] walk across that thing 10 to 12 some of
[56:17] them 20 feet long and never Scorch the
[56:21] bottom of their feet never feel 1 o of
[56:27] pain and yet they are doing this why for
[56:31] what purpose to be accepted by their
[56:36] gods because they are taught
[56:40] reincarnation so this is one reason why
[56:43] a real Hindu is not a meat eater now
[56:46] they'll serve you meat when you're there
[56:49] but they themselves will never eat
[56:52] meat they believe that it could could be
[56:57] their
[56:58] mother their grandfather their aunt
[57:01] their uncle that has died because you
[57:05] keep coming higher and higher in a form
[57:09] of life until you enter into that
[57:12] blessed
[57:13] State you know when I think of the
[57:17] darkness that's among the heathens of
[57:19] the age and then I think of the darkness
[57:22] that's among
[57:24] Christianity it breaks your heart
[57:27] to think that the majority of these
[57:29] people are not doing it for the pain
[57:33] they're not doing it for the consequence
[57:35] to be able to you know be have their
[57:37] picture on television or have their
[57:39] picture on a newspaper but they think
[57:42] they're pleasing their God or
[57:46] gods and they want to go to hell no they
[57:50] want to go to paradise whatever they
[57:54] think that is they want to go to
[57:57] heaven I saw a picture this week of one
[58:00] of the leaders of Hamas uh Yaya senoir
[58:03] is the third man from the top and he
[58:07] emerged out of the
[58:09] tunnels and I saw him as he had a
[58:11] picture I was telling Carol about as we
[58:13] come to church today there was a picture
[58:15] taken of him with a little boy maybe
[58:19] seven8 years old and he was holding him
[58:22] up in his arms this little boy had a
[58:25] hamos headband and he was dressed up
[58:28] like a Hamas militant
[58:31] Soldier had in his hands a weapon now
[58:36] remember these kids are taught from tiny
[58:40] tiny little things to hate
[58:44] Israel they will get a reward for every
[58:48] Jew that they
[58:50] kill this is what they're
[58:53] taught so you can see why that to
[58:57] killing Jews is not a big deal they're
[59:00] taught that like our children are taught
[59:03] grace and mercy and
[59:06] election they are taught that if they do
[59:10] this when they get to
[59:12] heaven all these men that give their
[59:15] lives will have
[59:17] 42 virgins waiting for them on the other
[59:22] side not only that but they're paid
[59:24] their families paid 10
[59:26] $1,000 if they get killed to be a martyr
[59:30] they get a free apartment for years paid
[59:34] for by these Palestinian
[59:37] groups so they are taught this they
[59:42] believe it they accept
[59:44] it now we sit here today and we say well
[59:48] that's crazy I agree but I wonder how
[59:52] much crazy stuff we
[59:54] believe wonder how much crazy stuff that
[59:57] was given to us when we were children
[1:00:00] and we still hold on to some crazy stuff
[1:00:03] because will not let the word wash us
[1:00:06] clean from all that nonsense amen you
[1:00:10] see it's so easy whenever you are prior
[1:00:14] religious to coming to the illumination
[1:00:16] of the day to carry over some of the
[1:00:19] things that you held on to that you were
[1:00:22] taught from mothers fathers grandmothers
[1:00:25] grandfather fathers people you loved and
[1:00:28] respected and whenever we look at Cain
[1:00:31] and Abel and realize they were not there
[1:00:34] in the Garden of Eden they actually
[1:00:36] never stepped foot in the Garden of Eden
[1:00:40] so they're only carrying out what their
[1:00:43] mother and father taught them to do so
[1:00:47] they never broke the mystery of what
[1:00:51] brought them out of the Garden of Eden
[1:00:53] so the prophet tells us that they were
[1:00:56] taught that it was
[1:00:58] fruit so here Adam in his Fallen State
[1:01:03] now chooses to teach these two boys and
[1:01:09] keep the
[1:01:10] mystery of Cain's father away from
[1:01:14] them so they're not going to share with
[1:01:18] them no doubt they did it out of
[1:01:22] love yeah we've been loved by a few
[1:01:25] people that way heaven
[1:01:27] we and they talked about it no doubt and
[1:01:31] thought now what what do you think we
[1:01:32] should do honey well I you know I really
[1:01:35] don't see no need in in them knowing do
[1:01:38] we really need to let them know this
[1:01:40] well you know what I I I think you're
[1:01:42] right I I just agree with you totally
[1:01:45] Eve because after all Adam that will so
[1:01:48] humiliate me don't you think that that
[1:01:50] we just kind of let this go we we just
[1:01:53] we'll just Let It Go I mean really we
[1:01:56] know there's not three Gods we know that
[1:01:59] that absolutely by the scripture nobody
[1:02:02] was baptized in the name of titles we
[1:02:05] know that we we know that it was you
[1:02:08] know after Constantine and all that 3258
[1:02:11] we know all that you think a lot of
[1:02:14] these preachers don't know
[1:02:15] that the prophet said how many of them
[1:02:18] are said in their study on Sunday
[1:02:20] morning and read acts 238 but they still
[1:02:23] won't preach it
[1:02:26] why they choose to remain silent as a
[1:02:30] matter of fact they might lose their
[1:02:31] position in the church I'd rather lose
[1:02:34] my position than Lose My Soul anybody
[1:02:38] else feel the same
[1:02:40] way and we know of course that whenever
[1:02:43] Abel by Revelation now remember God did
[1:02:48] not accept Abel's lamb before he
[1:02:51] accepted Abel God actually accept
[1:02:55] accepted the lamb because he accepted
[1:03:00] Abel you see we have it backwards when
[1:03:03] it comes to worship we think that God
[1:03:06] will accept us because I read I pray I
[1:03:10] fast I do this I do this many people
[1:03:13] think Divine Healing is given to them by
[1:03:16] merits I'm a Christian I love God God
[1:03:20] owes me healing no he doesn't the
[1:03:23] prophet said he would see it many times
[1:03:25] that Sinners would come across the
[1:03:27] platform and be healed and Christians
[1:03:30] would walk across the platform and not
[1:03:33] receive their healing why it's all about
[1:03:36] the approach The Sinner would just
[1:03:38] believe it they know they don't deserve
[1:03:40] it in the first place they know that God
[1:03:42] owes them nothing and they're just
[1:03:44] praying that God will have mercy and
[1:03:46] many of the Christians would walk across
[1:03:48] hey I'm a Christian I'm a Child of God
[1:03:50] God owes it to me even after you're a
[1:03:53] Christian God ain't obligated nothing to
[1:03:55] you
[1:03:56] or me either because it's not by our
[1:03:59] merits it's by the mercy of
[1:04:02] God so Abel then somehow God breaks open
[1:04:08] the the channel to him and when he does
[1:04:12] because he's already found favor pre
[1:04:18] sacrifice before he ever knew what to do
[1:04:22] before he ever got a lamb killed a lamb
[1:04:25] put all of the offering together he
[1:04:28] already found favor in the eyes of
[1:04:32] God and God gave him the Revelation now
[1:04:35] Cain of course did not find favor
[1:04:39] because of who he
[1:04:41] was and yet God in his Mercy offered to
[1:04:45] Cain the verse that we just read if thou
[1:04:49] doest well shalt not thou be accepted
[1:04:55] but if not sin lith at the door but if
[1:04:59] you will do
[1:05:01] well then you will be his ruler talking
[1:05:05] about Abel now I have the right to the
[1:05:07] firstborn remember firstborn
[1:05:10] rights but he said if you don't do it
[1:05:13] then sin lieth at the door the Hebrew
[1:05:16] words that Moses uses for that is just
[1:05:19] amazing and Moses the words that he
[1:05:22] chooses is like an animal crouching at
[1:05:26] the door that is waiting to attack the
[1:05:32] unsuspecting
[1:05:35] individual now God did not give Cain a
[1:05:38] revelation but God is going to accept
[1:05:42] him even if he will just worship like
[1:05:46] his brother does from head
[1:05:50] knowledge now I view things may be a
[1:05:53] little bit different than some I don't
[1:05:55] believe everybody that sits in a message
[1:05:58] church is bride that's right but I
[1:06:02] honestly believe myself lot would have
[1:06:06] been way better off to hung around
[1:06:10] Abraham and his move even though he had
[1:06:13] never been elect it's easy to see after
[1:06:17] he done what he done it was not the
[1:06:19] right move to leave all people say well
[1:06:22] you know what I don't understand what
[1:06:23] they're saying and I'm not one of them
[1:06:25] and I I'm is going to go to another
[1:06:26] church you watch yourself when you do
[1:06:29] that the way you will wind up now I want
[1:06:32] you to notice what God is offering Cain
[1:06:36] in this respect now remember what we're
[1:06:38] talking about is our right to be
[1:06:40] accepted that God tells him I will
[1:06:43] accept you on the basis of you doing it
[1:06:49] because the way was made known to your
[1:06:52] brother you don't understand it oh you
[1:06:55] say brother Don I don't understand the
[1:06:57] dress code of what you preach and I
[1:06:59] don't understand the message people have
[1:07:01] to do this and that and the other but
[1:07:04] you know what if you'll obey what God's
[1:07:06] word said God will honor you and
[1:07:09] sometimes I've seen it over the years
[1:07:11] the Revelation or strike you after your
[1:07:13] obedience brings forth fruit
[1:07:16] amen I wonder how this story would have
[1:07:20] been read differently had Kain done that
[1:07:23] thing now God know of course his choice
[1:07:25] and God knew what he would do and as we
[1:07:27] went through last Sunday to prove that
[1:07:29] God had made it known to Abel and did
[1:07:32] not make it known to Cain but look what
[1:07:34] do we find we find the old old type of
[1:07:39] the whosoever will
[1:07:41] group that can worship if they will do
[1:07:45] what God says now they're not elect they
[1:07:49] will not be in the first
[1:07:51] resurrection but there will be Millions
[1:07:55] times millions of people that will be
[1:07:59] saved that are not
[1:08:02] bride praise the Lord now look at God
[1:08:06] offering to Cain this
[1:08:10] offer and remember whenever we look at
[1:08:14] what Abel did he offered by Revelation
[1:08:17] so he knew he was going to be accepted
[1:08:20] before he ever cut that Lamb's throat
[1:08:22] how do he know that by
[1:08:24] revelation so God accepted Abel and
[1:08:28] accepted his offering the acceptance was
[1:08:31] already generated by divine
[1:08:34] revelation now notice a prophet said
[1:08:37] Abel LED his lamb Away by Grapevine
[1:08:40] sacrificed him on the Altar and Abel
[1:08:43] died on the same altar his sacrificed
[1:08:47] lamb died every believer that comes to
[1:08:50] Christ must die on the same altar with
[1:08:53] his dying lamb Christ and die in Christ
[1:08:57] to be a new creature die out to the
[1:09:00] things of the world become Born Again a
[1:09:03] new creature in Christ Jesus listen at
[1:09:06] the altar now you know the Bible goes on
[1:09:09] to tell us here in the Book of Genesis
[1:09:12] that after they' went to church and
[1:09:14] they' worshiped came uh was rejected and
[1:09:17] got angry all my his temper flared and
[1:09:21] he got so upset at God so upset at Abel
[1:09:24] and then the the Bible tells us down
[1:09:26] around verses 9 and 10 when you read it
[1:09:28] there that Cain and Abel were out in the
[1:09:32] field notice it doesn't say they were
[1:09:35] back in church so they were out in the
[1:09:39] field and Cain spoke to his brother Abel
[1:09:44] and he raised up against him and slew
[1:09:48] him so now Abel wasn't in church when he
[1:09:53] got died or when he got killed
[1:09:55] but he
[1:09:57] died on the same altar his lamb died
[1:10:01] on well how could that be if it was not
[1:10:05] the same geographical location it's the
[1:10:08] same with you and me we will never go to
[1:10:13] The Old Rugged Cross that the Lord Jesus
[1:10:17] died on that's not the Altra I'm
[1:10:20] pointing you today anyway that's not
[1:10:23] where you and I is going to die
[1:10:26] but the prophet named that altar watch
[1:10:30] this you become a new creature in Christ
[1:10:33] Jesus and die on the same
[1:10:37] altar of
[1:10:39] self
[1:10:43] sacrifice self
[1:10:46] sacrifice I don't have to go to
[1:10:49] Jerusalem and see if I could find a
[1:10:52] piece of the wood that Jesus died died
[1:10:55] on but I do have to die on the same
[1:11:00] altar self-
[1:11:02] sacrifice which a matter of fact is the
[1:11:05] hardest Altar for any of us to
[1:11:08] die many of us could offer our wife much
[1:11:12] easier than we could offer ourself we
[1:11:14] could offer our children for those of
[1:11:17] you that wouldn't hear Thursday night
[1:11:19] speaking about the question answers and
[1:11:21] brother joea got up and told about a
[1:11:24] lady that they had a arrested him and he
[1:11:26] was talking to her and she was drinking
[1:11:29] alcoholic and so on had two boys and she
[1:11:32] told Brother Joel that she would sell
[1:11:35] those boys for one
[1:11:42] beer easier to give up two boys than to
[1:11:46] deny
[1:11:47] herself that alcohol that was in one
[1:11:51] beer so is it with many many people that
[1:11:54] it's easier to give up this family
[1:11:56] member that one the other one than it is
[1:11:59] for them to die on the same altar that
[1:12:02] Jesus died on which was self-sacrifice
[1:12:05] remember Abel died on the altar with his
[1:12:07] lamb and every man that comes to Christ
[1:12:10] must die on the same altar Jesus Christ
[1:12:13] did on the altar of self- sacrifice
[1:12:18] forgiving your own ways or you say
[1:12:21] brother Donnie I've died years ago well
[1:12:23] let's just make sure shall we
[1:12:25] on forgetting your own ways forgetting
[1:12:29] your own
[1:12:31] reasons taking God's word and saying
[1:12:34] it's your word Lord I believe it and
[1:12:37] there
[1:12:38] Di and Abel he died oh notice on the
[1:12:43] rock with his same lamb that he died
[1:12:46] with what rock revelation of God's word
[1:12:50] we die out to Christ on the altars of
[1:12:54] God
[1:12:55] self
[1:12:58] sacrifice that makes me feel kind of
[1:13:00] religious to think God provided a way in
[1:13:03] that I could not save myself god making
[1:13:06] a way through Christ not by works lest
[1:13:10] any man should boast but by faith
[1:13:13] accepting it Jehovah God sending down
[1:13:17] the Holy Spirit stamping a seal on it of
[1:13:20] a confirmation sealed how long until the
[1:13:24] day
[1:13:25] of your
[1:13:27] Redemption now people think by accepting
[1:13:30] Christ as their savior that means
[1:13:33] they're born again that has been
[1:13:36] accepted for many many hundreds of
[1:13:39] years but that is not a Bible
[1:13:43] teaching Peter accepted the Lord Jesus
[1:13:46] as his savior been baptized by the Lord
[1:13:50] Jesus himself in water and yet the Lord
[1:13:54] Jesus told him when you are
[1:13:57] converted strengthen your brethren so
[1:14:00] you mean he was a saved man a baptized
[1:14:03] man but not a converted man it's easy to
[1:14:07] see he turned out to be a cussing yellow
[1:14:10] belly
[1:14:12] coward praise the Lord is that right so
[1:14:16] conversion is not accepting the Lord as
[1:14:18] your savior let me go a little further
[1:14:21] conversion is not even acknowledged that
[1:14:24] God has sent a message in the last day
[1:14:27] conversion is receiving the baptism of
[1:14:29] the Holy Ghost in your soul sealing you
[1:14:33] to the day of redemption Abel offered
[1:14:37] his sacrifice and killed his sacrifice
[1:14:40] for sin then he died on the same altar
[1:14:43] with his sacrifice in order to be born
[1:14:45] again you have to die on The Altar with
[1:14:48] your sacrifice Just As Dead As He was I
[1:14:52] want you to notice if you haven't
[1:14:53] listened to this I mentioned to last
[1:14:55] Sunday it's a great parallel I love the
[1:14:57] way the prophet uses this term inside of
[1:15:00] this message that you actually become
[1:15:03] crystallized and he uses this same term
[1:15:07] to identify the Lord Jesus and also to
[1:15:10] identify the serpent on the pole so the
[1:15:13] serpent on the pole had no life there
[1:15:16] was no movement in the serpent because
[1:15:19] it was crystallized breast there was no
[1:15:23] life in the body of the Lord Jesus when
[1:15:26] he bowed his head and gave up The Ghost
[1:15:28] and he Likens you and I to the same way
[1:15:32] when we are born again so we must we
[1:15:35] must die and be just as dead as the
[1:15:38] brass serpent was and just is dead as
[1:15:42] the human body of the Lord Jesus was
[1:15:45] there was no
[1:15:47] life and yet people say I've died I've
[1:15:51] died and then they still wind up
[1:15:53] drinking lying running
[1:15:59] around that's totally
[1:16:02] impossible because if that nature ever
[1:16:05] dies there is no Resurrection to that
[1:16:09] nature no my
[1:16:11] friends you just thought you
[1:16:20] died you cannot keep your Same Spirit
[1:16:24] you cannot keep keep your same
[1:16:27] habits you cannot keep your same
[1:16:31] thoughts you got to die you got to die
[1:16:35] like he
[1:16:36] died he got to die on his altar like
[1:16:39] Abel di with this lamb you got to die
[1:16:41] with your lamb you got to die you got to
[1:16:45] die to your own thinking and be born of
[1:16:49] his
[1:16:51] thinking so if we are all dead
[1:16:55] how come there's so many difference of
[1:16:57] opinions about the word of
[1:17:00] God all preachers are dead and all them
[1:17:03] born again how come we got sometime
[1:17:06] baptizing in titles how how come we got
[1:17:08] some baptizing in the name of Jesus how
[1:17:11] come they got so many different
[1:17:13] doctrines and yet every preacher is dead
[1:17:15] and every one of them is born of the
[1:17:16] spirit of God and show me 10 of them
[1:17:19] that preach the same
[1:17:20] thing there's something wrong somewhere
[1:17:25] now people think because they've got a
[1:17:27] change in life ohon I quit drinking
[1:17:30] praise the Lord for that I quit smoking
[1:17:32] thank the Lord for that but you don't
[1:17:33] just die to smoking you don't just die
[1:17:36] to drinking you die to your own thinking
[1:17:40] amen so you don't process the word well
[1:17:43] I know the Bible says that and I I know
[1:17:46] the prophet taught that but I don't
[1:17:48] believe it that way oh so the spirit of
[1:17:52] God Anointed The Prophet to preach
[1:17:53] certain things and preachers that say
[1:17:56] they believe this message don't feel the
[1:17:58] importance to say what he said I find
[1:18:00] that so
[1:18:03] unusual
[1:18:04] amen so I have to come down to one of
[1:18:07] two
[1:18:08] answers either you had the Holy Ghost
[1:18:10] and Malachi four Prophet didn't or he
[1:18:13] did and you
[1:18:17] don't I think I'll stick with a
[1:18:19] ladder since God never called you to be
[1:18:22] his Prophet anybody he that God called
[1:18:24] you to be for Luke 17:30 no I didn't
[1:18:27] think so so now watch how
[1:18:30] different that Cain's approach
[1:18:34] is UN Cain into his offering he had not
[1:18:37] respect and Cain was very Ross I
[1:18:40] remember there in church and they're
[1:18:41] hearing you know the word of God
[1:18:43] preached and to Ross was to be hot
[1:18:47] Furious burn become angry be kindled to
[1:18:52] heat oneself
[1:18:55] and vexation here again God did not
[1:18:57] accept the man so God would not accept
[1:19:00] the offering but it is the Fallen nature
[1:19:04] of man to want to be religious listen to
[1:19:06] this Cain wanted to be religious so he
[1:19:09] went and made his own
[1:19:11] religion and he went and did and brought
[1:19:14] it before God something like this here's
[1:19:16] the best I've got this is all I can do
[1:19:18] about it now you take it or leave
[1:19:22] it my friends if you look look at Islam
[1:19:25] you look at Hinduism taism you look at
[1:19:28] all of these religions and I I read a
[1:19:30] book many many years ago and it was
[1:19:33] where was God when Pagan religions began
[1:19:38] this man done quite a historical search
[1:19:41] and the chronology of the way false
[1:19:44] religion started it was a beautiful
[1:19:47] beautiful answer and types and how that
[1:19:51] all of these major false religions of
[1:19:53] the world followed a move of God and
[1:19:58] then when people would turn down that
[1:20:00] move of God that there was a religion
[1:20:03] which Satan raised up that they would
[1:20:06] accept instead of have you ever really
[1:20:09] looked at it even by the demographics
[1:20:11] and looking and see how that Islam
[1:20:14] affects a certain type of people you
[1:20:18] ever notied how that even the Church of
[1:20:21] Christ so-called affects a c certain
[1:20:25] type of people you also ever notice how
[1:20:28] few of them there are that ever accept
[1:20:30] the message not saying the can't because
[1:20:32] I know some that did but you notice how
[1:20:35] that each one of these religions will be
[1:20:38] able to draw a certain type of people
[1:20:40] wonder why Hinduism does not affect as
[1:20:44] many Europeans as it were those from
[1:20:47] India and Pakistan and Indonesia and
[1:20:51] some of there it's like Satan custom bit
[1:20:54] build bu and fit a religion for certain
[1:20:58] regions of the world it's like it would
[1:21:01] cater to them so then the Buddha arises
[1:21:05] on the earth and looking for a place to
[1:21:09] where you can be able to go into a state
[1:21:12] of
[1:21:13] meditation and the great Buddha oh my
[1:21:16] you know go he goes into this great
[1:21:18] thing isn't it amazing that Buddhism
[1:21:21] does not strike America isn't it amazing
[1:21:24] amazing that a Buddhism does not ex be
[1:21:28] able to express itself in the European
[1:21:30] countries but it's got something so why
[1:21:33] is it that the Anglican Church has never
[1:21:36] really took a hold in America like it
[1:21:38] has England now look at Satan he is the
[1:21:42] one who has cunningly devised all of
[1:21:45] these fake religions of the world to
[1:21:47] where people of a different demagogue
[1:21:49] and of a different place would have a
[1:21:52] religion which would cater to the own
[1:21:55] personal
[1:21:57] tastes so certain religions will go over
[1:22:00] in certain places and don't get off the
[1:22:02] ground in other places and yet it's just
[1:22:05] exactly what certain people are looking
[1:22:08] for and they will die for it they'll
[1:22:10] give their life for it but you know what
[1:22:13] God never devised his religion and said
[1:22:16] you know what now I'm going to make this
[1:22:17] certain religion for the Tri Cities area
[1:22:21] and I'm going to make it you know real
[1:22:22] unique to the Tri Cities and then them
[1:22:25] bunch of Yankees across the northern
[1:22:26] line up there in Ohio and all up through
[1:22:29] there you know what I I'm going to give
[1:22:31] them a Yankee religion I'm going to give
[1:22:33] them a Yankee version of the
[1:22:36] message you know what God don't do it
[1:22:38] that way God designs one way and you
[1:22:42] come that way or you perish so whether
[1:22:46] you're black white red yellow Mexican
[1:22:48] European knucklehead nod head whatever
[1:22:51] you are you come to God on one bis
[1:22:55] you're saved you're Sanctified you're
[1:22:57] filled with the Holy Ghost and then you
[1:23:00] are accepted as a worshiper in the body
[1:23:03] of Jesus
[1:23:09] Christ so notice Kain then he wanted to
[1:23:14] be
[1:23:15] religious isn't it amazing even with
[1:23:17] some Mormons Joseph Smith receiving the
[1:23:20] visitation y'all ever read the book of
[1:23:22] Mormon I've got one y'all ever studed on
[1:23:24] the history of the
[1:23:25] Mormons amazing certain class of people
[1:23:29] looking for a certain thing a personally
[1:23:32] enjoy talking to Mormons maybe I should
[1:23:35] rephrase that I enjoy baiting
[1:23:42] Mormons because it appears you know that
[1:23:45] there's a certain class of people that
[1:23:48] every religion will go to look at our
[1:23:50] message and you'll find out it's sad to
[1:23:53] say we're not too much much different
[1:23:55] and watch certain doctrines how it will
[1:23:58] go over in certain things someone sent
[1:24:00] me a clip the other day of a so-called
[1:24:03] message preacher standing before his
[1:24:07] congregation telling his congregation
[1:24:09] them screaming hollering carrying on
[1:24:13] awful telling them he was the Holy
[1:24:18] Ghost
[1:24:21] blasphemy come on now amen and yet it
[1:24:25] appeals to a certain group of people
[1:24:28] others this would appeal to them I'll
[1:24:31] tell you what appeals to the bride every
[1:24:33] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[1:24:35] God you'll not live by one quote you'll
[1:24:39] not live by two quotes you live by every
[1:24:42] word that comes out of the mouth of God
[1:24:45] come on somebody say Amen to the word
[1:24:48] this morning now what but it's Cain's
[1:24:51] way and Cain's way is still very active
[1:24:53] today so what Kain does is makes a
[1:24:56] religion and formulates one and he said
[1:24:58] God this is all I'm doing I'm not giving
[1:25:00] you my heart I'm not giving you my ways
[1:25:03] I'm keeping my stubbornness I'm keeping
[1:25:05] my jealousy I'm keeping my envy and my
[1:25:09] strive this is all I'm given to you
[1:25:11] don't you ever think I'll ever worship
[1:25:14] like that Holy Roller brother of
[1:25:18] mine oh my take it or leave it God
[1:25:27] but look at God's mercy but God still
[1:25:30] loved
[1:25:32] him and he
[1:25:34] still God still loved him and he still
[1:25:38] went after him God help
[1:25:41] us I said God help
[1:25:47] us God went after him so he still
[1:25:50] believes his formal ideas holds on to
[1:25:54] his
[1:25:54] culture hold on to all the things that
[1:25:57] he wanted and yet the prophet says about
[1:26:00] Cain he was more
[1:26:02] religious that Abel
[1:26:05] was he actually done more for the
[1:26:12] Lord jump down a couple of paragraphs
[1:26:14] brothers conflict between God and Satan
[1:26:17] paragraph 68 Cain was more religious
[1:26:20] than able sure was done more for the
[1:26:22] Lord than Abel
[1:26:25] did but Abel come in the way of the
[1:26:30] word in
[1:26:33] Eden so I guess I want to ask you this
[1:26:37] question this
[1:26:39] morning do we want to just be
[1:26:43] religious or do we want to be
[1:26:47] right do we want to be just
[1:26:51] religious or brother Paul do we want to
[1:26:53] be
[1:26:56] accepted come on what do you all
[1:27:01] want you know I I I Marvel in
[1:27:05] studying the message and I love looking
[1:27:07] at question
[1:27:09] answers because I I see in there the
[1:27:13] desires of many of the people not to
[1:27:16] debate not to argue they just want to be
[1:27:19] right and I also see that among question
[1:27:22] answers among our youth
[1:27:25] had some really good questions amen and
[1:27:27] some of them are just
[1:27:29] curious some of them they just want to
[1:27:32] be
[1:27:34] right and I I was searching it yesterday
[1:27:36] where the Prophet used these words is it
[1:27:40] wrong in quotation marks it'll minimize
[1:27:42] your search when you're doing that is it
[1:27:45] wrong and where I found most of these
[1:27:47] words were used was in question and
[1:27:51] answers so he got all types of
[1:27:55] questions and I have to believe that
[1:27:58] majority of them was not people trying
[1:27:59] to trip him up and people trying to
[1:28:03] argue or something like that but just to
[1:28:05] be right and I read one of them
[1:28:08] yesterday and it was a woman that had
[1:28:11] written it and he said she said is it
[1:28:13] wrong for a woman to shave her
[1:28:16] legs and it so set brother Brandon back
[1:28:19] he said am I reading that right
[1:28:28] now you know you're saying why would
[1:28:31] anybody even ask
[1:28:33] that the bottom line it comes down to
[1:28:36] one thing we want to be
[1:28:40] accepted so what if there's something in
[1:28:43] my life or
[1:28:44] yours and that one thing would deny you
[1:28:49] of being accepted in God's
[1:28:51] presence though you do so many other
[1:28:54] good
[1:28:55] things so this person this woman that
[1:28:58] had this
[1:29:00] question she wanted to know is it wrong
[1:29:03] for women to shave their legs of course
[1:29:05] he goes on gives them the answer and
[1:29:06] tells them no but there was many
[1:29:09] questions that he was asked about
[1:29:12] similar things is it wrong to do this is
[1:29:15] it wrong to go there we were married by
[1:29:17] the justice of the peace 21 years ago
[1:29:20] was it wrong yes brother sister it was
[1:29:23] wrong marriage belongs in church but
[1:29:25] actually your vow and he goes on to
[1:29:27] explain it you know but well then he
[1:29:30] said well then if that being said does
[1:29:32] that mean they should get remarried
[1:29:33] again well he said if it bothers your
[1:29:36] faith if it hinders your faith then do
[1:29:39] it so the bottom line was still coming
[1:29:41] down to what that person feeling like
[1:29:44] that they are accepted in the presence
[1:29:46] of God there are many many people I have
[1:29:50] re-baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:29:52] Jesus Christ
[1:29:55] in the Decades of my
[1:29:57] Ministry many of them was baptized
[1:30:00] correctly but yet when they would get
[1:30:02] down to pray a question would just come
[1:30:04] up you need to be rebap tized you got
[1:30:06] cold on the Lord one time and you need
[1:30:08] to get re-baptized and I have talked to
[1:30:10] so many about this same thing and they
[1:30:15] come to me brother Donnie it keeps
[1:30:16] coming to me it keeps coming to me
[1:30:18] should I do it I say if it's bothering
[1:30:20] you settle the question even though
[1:30:24] there are no scriptures that says that
[1:30:27] you got to be re-baptized if you get
[1:30:29] cold on the Lord and I told the last
[1:30:31] person I talked that to I said if I
[1:30:34] baptize everybody that just got cold on
[1:30:36] the Lord I'd never stop
[1:30:38] baptizing I'd baptized from Monday
[1:30:41] through Sunday if I'd have to take a
[1:30:43] break and then I'd said all line right
[1:30:45] up again and we just I just keep right
[1:30:47] on going on wouldn't me but if it
[1:30:50] bothers you do it somebody hearing me
[1:30:53] well I don't know why I said that but
[1:30:54] the Lord knows why I said it but you see
[1:30:57] what is the main desire that people want
[1:31:01] to be
[1:31:03] accepted listen this question brother
[1:31:06] brandham should a Christian woman wear
[1:31:09] simple jewelry as necklaces or pearls
[1:31:14] now watch again this question and no
[1:31:17] doubt my goodness as curious as many of
[1:31:20] us are it's a good thing we wasn't alive
[1:31:22] and well whenever those question
[1:31:23] questions is going on I can't imagine
[1:31:26] some of the ones I'd have submitted to
[1:31:27] him can you imagine some of the ones
[1:31:29] that we would have now after all these
[1:31:31] years of the message being around but
[1:31:33] don't you appreciate the question and
[1:31:35] answers I'm so glad the Lord the laid it
[1:31:37] on his heart to do it now watch what
[1:31:39] what is this about it's about a person
[1:31:43] wanting to know am I
[1:31:46] accepted am I accepted or does this
[1:31:49] displease the Lord if I would wear a
[1:31:53] necklace
[1:31:54] or pearls now why would anybody even
[1:31:57] have a question about it well of course
[1:31:59] because of what the Bible says and Paul
[1:32:02] wrote about it and Peter wrote about it
[1:32:05] as well and they was wanting to know
[1:32:08] what what would be there would a person
[1:32:11] be wrong would a person be displeasing
[1:32:14] the lord well sister I know this means a
[1:32:18] lot to you it means a lot for for me for
[1:32:23] you to place your confidence that I'd
[1:32:26] tell you the truth now notice it meant a
[1:32:29] lot to her and it meant a lot to brother
[1:32:31] brandham that she would Place confidence
[1:32:33] in him now remember the Bible said when
[1:32:36] you adorn that you adorn with costly
[1:32:38] pearls jewels and pearls and all kinds
[1:32:41] of wearing of jewelry but let the
[1:32:43] adorning of peace and quiet Meek Spirit
[1:32:46] which I just quoted which is a great
[1:32:48] price before the Lord now I don't mean
[1:32:51] by that sister that if you had a pen now
[1:32:54] this is me not the Lord if you had a pen
[1:32:57] that you wanted to wear or a little
[1:33:00] necklace your husband gave you maybe
[1:33:02] something like that you wore now to me I
[1:33:04] don't think that's bad now that's just
[1:33:06] remember remember I make myself clear
[1:33:09] that's my
[1:33:11] opinion and I find it so
[1:33:13] amazing that for the sisters who want to
[1:33:16] wear necklaces or pens or so on they
[1:33:19] have no problem whatsoever in taking
[1:33:22] this opinion
[1:33:24] and then they'll categorize other
[1:33:26] doctrinal things which they say is his
[1:33:29] opinion and they say they don't have to
[1:33:31] take
[1:33:33] them ah so you see what we're doing
[1:33:36] don't you picking choosing picking
[1:33:40] choosing I want I don't want who told
[1:33:43] you this was a smorgus board who told
[1:33:46] you this was a cafeteria and you go
[1:33:49] through oh I don't want broccoli I don't
[1:33:51] want asparagus I don't want collar
[1:33:53] greens I don't want I do want chocolate
[1:33:55] cake I do want chocolate pudding I do
[1:33:57] want roast beer and that's what we're
[1:33:59] doing to the message of the
[1:34:01] hour well come on somebody Hallelujah
[1:34:05] and what if those things though that we
[1:34:08] are leaving out and leaving behind are
[1:34:10] the very things that'll be required for
[1:34:13] a body change but we left them
[1:34:16] laying because we designate them as the
[1:34:20] prophet's opinion so who gave you the
[1:34:23] the opinion
[1:34:26] award who put you in charge of the
[1:34:30] opinion
[1:34:32] Department was you voted in or how did
[1:34:35] that work exactly that you can go
[1:34:37] through the message that designate to
[1:34:39] the rest of us poor Mortals that's just
[1:34:41] struggling to find the way of
[1:34:42] righteousness and Truth who appointed
[1:34:45] you as the opinion president come on man
[1:34:48] well thank you
[1:34:50] Jesus now notice what is this simple
[1:34:54] question about you sisters appreciate
[1:34:57] this question and the
[1:35:01] answers
[1:35:03] wow now notice none of your brothers
[1:35:07] though raised your
[1:35:11] hands now you know whenever Paul wrote
[1:35:13] about jewelry and things like that and
[1:35:16] when Peter wrote about it he never
[1:35:19] addressed it to any of the
[1:35:22] men whenever brother brandham answers
[1:35:25] the question he does not address it to
[1:35:29] men and as a matter of fact I've never
[1:35:31] even found a question where men ask him
[1:35:34] the question brother brandom is it okay
[1:35:36] if we wear
[1:35:39] necklaces or if we men wear
[1:35:42] bracelets or nose rings or earrings or
[1:35:45] toe rings or can you imagine Jesus with
[1:35:48] a necklace on you imagine brother
[1:35:51] brandham with one on let's bring hang on
[1:35:54] down to your local church can you
[1:35:55] imagine me and brother Daryl coming out
[1:35:58] with a necklace hanging
[1:36:00] down now watch so it's eliminated in the
[1:36:05] scripture it's
[1:36:07] eliminated in the message so apparently
[1:36:11] it's not
[1:36:13] acceptable
[1:36:15] right on oh I know it's picking up among
[1:36:18] the message among some of our boys I
[1:36:20] don't care if it is it still ain't right
[1:36:23] and it ain't
[1:36:24] acceptable you boys I'm telling you
[1:36:27] something you let our sisters Bear all
[1:36:29] the reproach of this word their hair
[1:36:32] goes out they dress in dresses it's not
[1:36:34] you boys going around in your blue jeans
[1:36:37] and your t-shirt on that looks any more
[1:36:40] strange or weird than anybody else out
[1:36:42] here but our women and our sisters bear
[1:36:45] the reproach by the way they live and
[1:36:47] some of you boys think you can go out
[1:36:49] here and look like some of these rock
[1:36:51] stars and dress yourself and blue jeans
[1:36:54] it's so tight that you can't even hardly
[1:36:57] move without sinning and you think
[1:37:00] you're accepted you compromising yellow
[1:37:03] belly
[1:37:15] coward you see I would know that women
[1:37:19] could not preach in the New Testament
[1:37:21] even if Paul hadn't directly said it
[1:37:23] that it was not allowed for them to
[1:37:25] speak in the church or that a woman
[1:37:27] should not assert authority over a man
[1:37:29] if those scriptures were totally left
[1:37:32] out I personally would know women could
[1:37:35] not preach
[1:37:37] because there are no guidlines in the
[1:37:40] New Testament for a woman
[1:37:44] Pastor now for me according to the word
[1:37:46] and every other God called man according
[1:37:49] to the Bible both in Timothy and in
[1:37:51] Titus Paul laid out the requirements for
[1:37:55] a bishop which is a pastor the
[1:37:58] requirement in both Timothy and Titus
[1:38:00] both began with the most important of
[1:38:05] all
[1:38:06] requirements and that is the man must be
[1:38:10] blameless which would knock I hate to
[1:38:13] say it but it would knock some of our
[1:38:15] Pastors in the message from out of the
[1:38:17] pull pit how can a church splitter meet
[1:38:19] that first
[1:38:21] requirement how can a man who to what
[1:38:24] the prophets say meet that first
[1:38:26] requirement of being blameless how can a
[1:38:28] troublemaking preacher ever meet that
[1:38:31] first requirement to be blameless and be
[1:38:33] a pastor he can't do it it shows the
[1:38:35] ignorance of the people that will vote
[1:38:37] such a man
[1:38:39] in Amen Brother D but you see the Bible
[1:38:44] does not say now to you women now it
[1:38:47] says about the men that they must be
[1:38:49] blameless they must be the husband of
[1:38:51] one wife that must have their children
[1:38:53] in control so the Bible gives us the
[1:38:55] requirements but if you ever notice the
[1:38:57] Bible doesn't say now to you women
[1:39:00] pastors you must be the wife of one
[1:39:03] husband or in this modern day you must
[1:39:06] be the wife of one
[1:39:09] wife bunch of perverted Hellbound
[1:39:13] denominational
[1:39:21] bastards neither does the Bible give us
[1:39:24] requirements for women
[1:39:28] deacons I'm sure there's a few women in
[1:39:31] the message that think they could handle
[1:39:32] it a lot better than men
[1:39:34] do but there's no requirement again for
[1:39:37] women deacons she shall be the wife of
[1:39:40] one husband and her husband must be in
[1:39:42] direct obedience to his wife the husband
[1:39:46] cannot openeth his mouth to his wife
[1:39:49] because she will be disqualified she
[1:39:52] must be Butch she must be Brazen she
[1:39:55] must be bold she must know how to put
[1:39:58] her hand on her hip and tell her finger
[1:40:00] and point it in them kids faith and say
[1:40:03] don't you young ones go to running in
[1:40:04] and out again or I'll take his hand and
[1:40:07] I'll warm your britches where you sat
[1:40:17] down oh
[1:40:20] me so the Bible gives no requirements
[1:40:23] for wom preachers no requirements for
[1:40:25] women
[1:40:26] deacons and the Bible does not mention
[1:40:29] where men can wear necklaces so it has
[1:40:31] no restrictions as far as saying no I
[1:40:33] men you know let it be simple
[1:40:36] pearls on I know you're
[1:40:39] laughing I know you're laughing but do
[1:40:41] you understand that in our age men have
[1:40:45] started wearing pearl
[1:40:48] necklaces don't you understand it's a
[1:40:50] sign of perversion
[1:41:01] I think it's the approach to it he say
[1:41:03] it's the way you do
[1:41:04] it it's the motive behind it and when
[1:41:08] you see it getting a hold of
[1:41:11] you then leave the thing alone yeah but
[1:41:16] I think as far as a necklace now if you
[1:41:18] go to listen to this I love brother
[1:41:21] brenham's Yale
[1:41:23] graduation that just so documented his
[1:41:26] ability don't you to bring stuff into
[1:41:29] life and just absolutely blows you away
[1:41:31] with such theological
[1:41:35] terms if you go to loading yourself up
[1:41:38] like you went through the 10 cent store
[1:41:40] with a magnet
[1:41:42] on you can imagine now a woman that's
[1:41:45] got a magnet on and she goes through the
[1:41:47] well everything's really inflated now
[1:41:49] there is no more 10 cent
[1:41:51] stores so a woman woman goes through the
[1:41:54] dollar store at Walmart and all of a
[1:41:55] sudden it
[1:41:57] just just plastered her on the face and
[1:41:59] in the ears and I
[1:42:06] mean excuse that I didn't mean to say it
[1:42:09] like that he
[1:42:11] said that's
[1:42:13] wrong 1 Timothy 2:9 but in like manner
[1:42:16] also the women are doing themselves in
[1:42:23] modest apparel with
[1:42:26] shamefacedness and
[1:42:28] sobriety not with broaded hair or gold
[1:42:31] or pearls or cost the array which was
[1:42:35] the way the
[1:42:36] prostitutes did in the days of Paul
[1:42:39] right amen so they take the long Tresses
[1:42:42] of their
[1:42:44] hair remember there's one woman in the
[1:42:47] Bible who wore
[1:42:51] makeup her name
[1:42:54] was not
[1:42:56] Mary or Mary
[1:42:59] Magdalene tell me her name Jebel
[1:43:04] Jezebel
[1:43:06] Jezebel oh
[1:43:10] my so what is the question then let me
[1:43:14] finish this part
[1:43:16] here while the cross necklace has deep
[1:43:19] religious significance for many
[1:43:24] it's appeal to non-religious individuals
[1:43:26] cannot be
[1:43:28] ignored in today's society wearing a
[1:43:31] cross
[1:43:34] necklace is often more about
[1:43:38] fashion than faith it is involved into a
[1:43:43] symbol of
[1:43:44] cultural
[1:43:48] heritage
[1:43:52] Rebellion or simply an appreciation for
[1:43:55] aesthetically pleasing jewelry it's all
[1:43:58] about making a statement and standing
[1:44:02] out from the
[1:44:07] crowd so then AC cross being the symbol
[1:44:10] of suffering and the symbol of Shame and
[1:44:13] the symbol of torture and look what
[1:44:16] Satan's done Twisted it right
[1:44:19] around and make it as a symbol except Ed
[1:44:24] culturally by people who don't even
[1:44:26] believe in
[1:44:31] God pop culture plays a significant role
[1:44:37] in influencing fashion
[1:44:39] trends and cross necklaces are no
[1:44:43] exception from musicians to actors many
[1:44:48] celebrities have been spotted rocking
[1:44:52] cross
[1:44:53] necklaces and their fans are quick to
[1:44:57] follow
[1:45:02] suit ain't it amazing though for a
[1:45:06] gospel preacher to preach the real
[1:45:08] truths of the
[1:45:11] Cross people think he's hard harsh not
[1:45:16] loving
[1:45:17] understanding but a pop
[1:45:20] icon can be seen with one
[1:45:23] and people want to follow
[1:45:26] him and wear it around their
[1:45:30] neck I don't want
[1:45:34] one around my
[1:45:37] neck I want to
[1:45:40] die on
[1:45:47] mine are we really interested in pop
[1:45:51] culture are we interested in worldly
[1:45:56] Trends or are we interested in being
[1:46:03] saved now years ago to have been
[1:46:07] identified with the cross even for
[1:46:09] sisters that wore them brother bram's
[1:46:11] days it wasn't such a common thing to
[1:46:13] see him among men wasn't a common thing
[1:46:15] in the days of Paul they just didn't do
[1:46:17] it but what's doing it now pop culture
[1:46:21] and Satan wants to turned a cross into a
[1:46:25] symbol of Pop
[1:46:30] Culture don't you never let the
[1:46:34] cross become a
[1:46:36] symbol of decoration sisters those of
[1:46:39] you that even wear
[1:46:41] them don't let it become a shiny symbol
[1:46:45] when you wear that thing
[1:46:48] remember it's a symbol your lord Jesus
[1:46:52] died on
[1:46:54] that so you could die on
[1:46:58] yours
[1:47:00] sir what else will pop culture
[1:47:04] take and change will it be our Bible
[1:47:07] next they've already done marriage that
[1:47:10] way they've already done so much of the
[1:47:14] gospel and change
[1:47:18] it my
[1:47:20] god listen this their fans are quick to
[1:47:24] follow suit it's no wonder that
[1:47:29] guys want to emulate the style
[1:47:34] icons they
[1:47:37] admire and wearing a cross
[1:47:41] necklace is one
[1:47:43] way to do just that
[1:47:53] may God help
[1:47:57] us so do we want to be
[1:48:01] right or do we want to
[1:48:04] be
[1:48:06] accepted I figure as we go on in
[1:48:09] time the men around this message who
[1:48:12] really preach
[1:48:13] self-denial
[1:48:15] self-sacrifice are going to be hated
[1:48:17] more than ever
[1:48:20] before it will be The Men Who preach
[1:48:23] from arrogance and
[1:48:25] pride and self-exaltation
[1:48:29] that Satan will try to
[1:48:33] use and don't be a bit
[1:48:36] surprised if there will not be a surge
[1:48:39] in some message
[1:48:43] churches and there will be certain men
[1:48:45] of
[1:48:46] God that people will drop them like a
[1:48:49] hot potatoes we
[1:48:51] say because people need this
[1:48:54] self-imagery
[1:48:55] they're not making all these self-help
[1:48:58] books for
[1:48:59] nothing people want to be told how great
[1:49:02] they are how wonderful they
[1:49:05] are they want to be told how to make
[1:49:09] thems a
[1:49:12] God that they control their
[1:49:15] Destiny they control their
[1:49:18] looks they control who and what they are
[1:49:21] to become
[1:49:25] so people like myself many other
[1:49:28] brothers around the message that preach
[1:49:30] that you are not going to be who you
[1:49:33] want to be but if you're a bride you
[1:49:36] belong to
[1:49:37] him and you were bought with a
[1:49:40] price and you do not belong to yourself
[1:49:44] am
[1:49:47] am let B our head shall we
[1:49:56] dear Lord
[1:50:02] Jesus praise the
[1:50:05] Lord one day friends we're all going to
[1:50:07] stand before the Lord and I'm going to
[1:50:09] walk before him and give an account for
[1:50:12] every sermon I've ever
[1:50:14] preached the counsel I've give to every
[1:50:18] person you're going to walk before him
[1:50:21] and you're going to give an account for
[1:50:22] every service you've set
[1:50:24] in with your response to the word that
[1:50:26] was preached and then what you did
[1:50:29] afterwards on Monday Tuesday and
[1:50:31] Wednesday and so
[1:50:34] on we know according to the way Paul
[1:50:36] taught it
[1:50:37] that some people actually their Works
[1:50:40] will be
[1:50:41] burned annihilated
[1:50:44] destroyed but their soul will be
[1:50:48] saved but they'll have hard and no
[1:50:50] reward at all
[1:50:54] I don't know about you I want to be
[1:50:56] accepted before the Lord
[1:50:59] Jesus I believe if we are that we will
[1:51:02] actually be Vindicated in this
[1:51:06] life he wants his presence to be among
[1:51:09] us not just as a preacher but he wants
[1:51:11] you to be
[1:51:12] Vindicated as a Son of God or a daughter
[1:51:15] of
[1:51:16] God will there always be
[1:51:19] questions you see the devil we have to
[1:51:21] give him credit he does know what he's
[1:51:24] doing so he has advanced sin and things
[1:51:29] that are wrong outside of biblical
[1:51:35] terminology he has advanced sin
[1:51:38] outside of even some message
[1:51:44] terminology you don't find brother
[1:51:46] brandham preaching on certain certain
[1:51:48] things and calling you know marijuana
[1:51:51] you don't find brother Brandon
[1:51:53] using oxycodone you don't find brother
[1:51:55] brand using many of the things in this
[1:51:57] day it was not there in that
[1:52:01] day it's like they're more covered in
[1:52:06] generalities and it makes it very hard
[1:52:08] as a pastor and as a minister when
[1:52:11] you're striking sin and people ask is
[1:52:14] this wrong is that wrong is that
[1:52:17] wrong and you can search and study as
[1:52:19] much as you
[1:52:21] want and you'll never find certain
[1:52:24] words to declare
[1:52:27] it you know what you can go back to your
[1:52:30] own heart and look and see and the
[1:52:32] prophet said if there's a question in
[1:52:34] your
[1:52:35] mind why you even want to do
[1:52:40] it so young men young women of our
[1:52:46] church one day you're going to stand
[1:52:48] before the Lord and you'll walk up there
[1:52:50] before him young sisters
[1:52:53] it'll be you and
[1:52:55] Jesus not you and your mama you and your
[1:52:57] daddy or if you're a married young lady
[1:52:59] not you and your
[1:53:01] husband it won't even be you and
[1:53:05] me but you'll walk up before him and
[1:53:08] you'll give an account to the way that
[1:53:10] you
[1:53:12] dressed and if you dressed in a
[1:53:14] provocative way out on the
[1:53:18] public and you cause men to look at you
[1:53:22] and to desire you because of the way you
[1:53:24] presented
[1:53:27] yourself Lord Jesus I'll make you answer
[1:53:29] for
[1:53:31] that your brothers in the way that
[1:53:33] you've raised your homes and your
[1:53:36] families and the way you've treated your
[1:53:38] wives it's not enough just to be a well
[1:53:41] I I provide for my family I I I work
[1:53:44] hard and I bring them home money they
[1:53:45] don't always need money they need
[1:53:48] love they need
[1:53:50] attention your daughters need to know
[1:53:53] that they're loved your sons need to
[1:53:55] know that they're loved tell them let
[1:53:58] them know let them know let your wife
[1:54:01] know that you love her just as much if
[1:54:04] not more than you did when you married
[1:54:06] her 10 years ago 20 years ago 30 years
[1:54:09] ago and a few months from me and Carol
[1:54:12] 51 years
[1:54:14] ago don't assume they know it tell them
[1:54:19] this is part of who we
[1:54:21] are that's part of denying yourself and
[1:54:24] dying on your
[1:54:25] cross or do we just want to be a a pop
[1:54:29] icon in the message and we just sing
[1:54:31] about the cross and we hang one on our
[1:54:34] mirror why you got a a cross on your
[1:54:37] reiv your mirror well the prophet did it
[1:54:40] so I do it so it just becomes a message
[1:54:43] symbol then we have one on our belt
[1:54:47] buckle some of you may have one on your
[1:54:49] Bible
[1:54:50] case I'm not against that now but my
[1:54:54] question is has it changed your Bible
[1:54:59] case your sisters that wear your cross
[1:55:02] around your
[1:55:03] neck has it made you any more in love
[1:55:05] with
[1:55:08] Jesus let's emphasize on what the cross
[1:55:11] means for
[1:55:15] us
[1:55:18] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:55:23] Lord Jesus I know these
[1:55:26] last five or six weeks it
[1:55:31] seems we moved into such a
[1:55:35] somber serious
[1:55:39] tenor it's like you're putting your word
[1:55:41] before us father and we must contemplate
[1:55:45] and
[1:55:48] decide Lord for me and my house
[1:55:52] I want to serve
[1:55:53] you I don't need another Wednesday night
[1:55:56] service or Another

[1:56:22] listening to the
[1:56:24] service and you spoke to his heart even
[1:56:27] as he was driving toward the
[1:56:32] service was there anything wrong in his
[1:56:36] life and before he ever even got to
[1:56:38] church you started dealing with him
[1:56:42] about something he need to
[1:56:44] fix that's the way we are today Lord we
[1:56:48] want to be
[1:56:50] right search US Lord

[1:57:48] that the doctors have given to him Lord
[1:57:51] they're doing everything they know to do
[1:57:53] to try to treat
[1:57:55] him then Lord these other places coming
[1:57:57] up on his body and you see how it's
[1:58:00] affected him Lord something that the
[1:58:03] doctors have just recently diagnosed and
[1:58:05] even found out about we're told in the
[1:58:07] last days that there'd be such things
[1:58:09] released on the earth that cancer would
[1:58:12] look like a
[1:58:14] toothache but Lord God no matter how
[1:58:16] many diseases they find your blood Lord
[1:58:20] Jesus atones and your stripes has
[1:58:22] already paid the price We join our faith
