yes Lord and the things will grow strange de in the and the light of his glory and [Music] grace hallelujah praise the Lord how many has a need on your heart tonight physical spiritual mental Financial maybe it's in your your family on your job I think the Lord showed us so many things whenever he was here and in his prophet's ministry as well about how God is concerned about little things most of us that never give a possum the time of day if it was out on the road a lot of us would try to run over it probably if it was in our yard eating cat food or dog food or something like that we try to run it off but yet God showed us he was so concerned one day about an OP possum yeah sent her to Elijah's house so if Elijah was to be able to pray for that op possum and if God could send an Elijah aosome to pray for what about your needs tonight are they not more important than aosome or a little bitty old fish and God gave it back its life so what about your troubles your heartbreaks your issues in your life let's just hold our petitions in our hearts as we approach him father it's through your own bidding that we come tonight we would not venture to do so if you had not gave us your scriptures and your own desires telling us to cast all of our cares upon you you knew Lord especially in this last day that there would be so many many cares sometimes I get overwhelmed just trying to remember all the people and all the needs that I'm asked to pray for Lord by phone call by email by text by WhatsApp by all the rest of the channels of communication that we all have and this one needing prayer for one thing someone else needing prayer for something else and then there's always those that don't ask for prayer but we can sense there's a little something not quite right with them where they are they're developing an attitude and they're kind of drawing back in church and they used to sit on the front row now they sit on the back row or they used to sit in the middle and they used to clap their hands and praise the Lord and now that it's set up high in the mine and they don't say Amen no more and they kind of got a look on their face so Lord every one of our needs tonight we bring them before you we realize that we are so needy I have to be honest with you sir I don't I don't know how you put put up with us I don't know why you'd even give us the time of day especially us Christians not just the lost people their pigs eating slop but us who have kissed Heaven's cup of blessings and sometimes we're the ones that have a worse attitude than just a poal wretched siner and you don't give up on us when we get in a wrong mindset or when we go to getting all kinds of things going on in our head that ain't even true you put up with us in our failures you put up with us in our shortcomings and you love us the same thank you for doing that Lord as we approach you tonight we're asking for this service and praying that you'd be mindful of us Lord help me that I can get out of the way and submit myself to you Lord may you help the people to be able to pull and we believe we'll be blessed together as we as we've joined in this place tonight in the name of Jesus we ask amen praise the Lord ain't it wonderful to be in church on Wednesday night I love Wednesday night church of course I'm kind of weird I like church on Monday night Tuesday night Wednesday night Thursday night Friday night Saturday night Sunday night I just like going to church I'm so glad when the Lord saved me so many many many many many years ago that he gave me a desire in my heart to go to church Someone told me that they had um some time ago I heard a minister talking about it as well that he went up to the brandham Tabernacle to visit it just to go there and as I heard the brothers uh testimony talking about it and whenever they took him in him and his wife and they opened the door and when they allowed them to come in and it smelled like an old musty vacant building and I saw from there went forth some of the greatest messages that have ever struck the Earth and brother Daryl's probably never told most of you but brother Daryl had a dream many many years ago and he saw the brandom Tabernacle and it was turned into a museum and when I heard this brother which this brother is not aware of I'm sure brother Daryl's dream but he was talking about going in there and he said it was just a museum and I was reminded of what I heard brother Bram say this Tabernacle will lose its strength so you can go pray there but you can't pray out loud you have to pray silently so if the Lord would carry another 15 20 years 30 years what what do you all want this to be a museum should we bring in some of my coats or some of brother randam suits or uh maybe it's Bible or something like that and make relics is that what we want we see no doubt the people who were part of the brandham Tabernacle if a preacher would have asked them that years ago they said are you crazy are you of your mind we'll never turn this into a museum oh but you see time time has a way of working on people you go to letting up this and swapping off that Letting Go your prayer life and letting go believing in this and believing in that the next thing you know you don't even believe in going to church you don't think it's even necessary so one of the men who took this G coming through the voice of God he told him he said you know I feel sorry for you people who go to church cuz you only go to church twice a week maybe two hours on Wednesday two hours on Sunday but we go to church every day because we've turned our homes into our churches I thought how ignorant can anybody be they don't even know the meaning of the New Testament word church for it's a place that people leave their homes and gather in one place so friends no matter what we think we know about the Lord and how think we're good we think we're doing let's never forget let's never forget the mighty have fallen all down Through the Ages right don't let that be said about us may our church always be a Saving Station a place of healing or the Melvin Deliverance or the presence of God can move God forbid that our place would be turned into a museum well was that for you I don't know who that was for but there you go thank you Revelation 5:7 now we'll H to the notes Revelation 5: 7 through um verses 10 and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the pray prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song now remember their so they so in relation to what's going on on the earth I know I've been saying it a lot lately but I want you to know that heaven is not that far away from where we are when the prophet was carried beyond the curtain of time in the sixth Dimension he looked back at his body and he wasn't 20 ft from where he was at so it's not like you know miles millions and millions of miles it's in another dimension that's moving faster than this one so whenever things are correlating on the earth many times are correlating in heaven together which this is what's happened here when he had taken the book The Four beasts and 4 and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vows full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and H has redeemed us now these people beings are evidently people creatures that were at one time lost cuz they were saying thou Hast redeemed us to God so this can't be Angels can't be cherubim can't be seraphim zoons cannot be any Angelic order but it was human beings that had already went beyond the curtain of time H has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation notice how they're talking they're in heaven they're in a Heavenly realm but they're still talking une Earthly language notice how they speak about Redemption thou has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation now here they are up in that Heavenly realm but they're still acknowledging that there would be blacks whites Chinese you know Aborigines all types of people that'll be in the work of redemption and these redeemed Saints are Reckoning that in heaven and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign upon the Earth may the Lord bless his words you may be seated now let run a a parallel tonight in the book of ruths 4: 11 I love the way that God foreshadows so many things in the New Testament by types and things that he reflected in the Old Testament of course we know the Book of Ruth is a book of redemption a book of redemption Ruth 4:1 and all the people that were in the gate and the elders said we Are Witnesses the Lord make the woman that is com to thine house like Rachel and like Leah which too did build the house of Israel now want you notice how that the elders and the people their voices is coming together they probably don't even realize what they're saying but they're inspired by the presence of God which too did build the house of Israel and do thou worthily in ephata and be famous in Bethlehem now Ephrata is another word for bethleem and I quoted to you last Wednesday night I believe it's Micah maybe chapter 5 verse 2 that whenever he talked about that there would come a great Prince oh thou Bethlehem ephata Thou Art the least among the children of my people yet out of the shall come a great Prince which shall rule over my people so here they are many many hundreds of years prior to that thing taking place but the spirit of God was moving on them and they were speaking prophetic utters and be famous in Bethlehem now I mentioned to you that the Book of Ruth is the book of redemption and I found this amazing when you go to look at this Redemption is the theme of this book because 15 times the word Redemption is found in the 12 verses of this text the words redeem is found eight times redeeming is found once by is found three biased is found once bought once purchased once so truly it is a book of redemption yeah the name of the book is not redeemed or the name of the book is not the book of redemption but the name of the book is a gentile bride so the very name of the book shows us the opom of redemption that God is foreshadowing a great thing that he's going to do in Redemption now notice in verse 12 as they go on with this utterance and let thy house be like the house of Fes whom Tamar bear unto Judah of the seed which the Lord shall give thee of this young woman now remember as we looked at it last Wednesday night that Judah unwittingly actually gave Tamar a seed which would become the heir of the kingly tribe of Judah now David knew of course he's going to come later after this but he knew that God was going to bring the king out of the house of Judah but they didn't know which family in particular now remember there were 12 tribes but then there were particular families that was going to be born out of the tribes now let me give you another example of that which would be the tribe of Levi but there were many families in the tribe of Levi and they didn't know which one is going to be this order or that order but God had to particularly pick a certain family which would come down through abinadab of course then come right on down through Moses come down through Aaron so even though they were of the right tribe there had to be a particular family so Judah is going to have many families that will come out of him but only God can pick the particular family which will be the kingly domain so Judah unwillingly gave unto Tamar the leverate obligation which would fulfill the leverate law that was that he should have give her her the the youngest son but he refused to do it so God had allowed this to work out now remember God never had her to do evil God never had her to do wrong but God took even in their mistakes and in their error and the wrong approach Grace overshadowed their error and God did something marvelous out of it so let me just give you a little bit of a warning tonight there there tends to be this thing that you know wants to move Among Us sometimes especially those that have maybe never committed to those that have never had a child out of wedlock or those that have never done some horrific sins and then you know it it it can kind of be a thing a stigma for not careful that we will tend to look down our noses at those who do such and we think well they certainly cannot be elected well I'll tell you right now you are excluding several women of the lineal inheritance of the Lord Jesus himself so what we need to do is be really careful and let God pick the ones he wants and thank God for his grace because whether or not you've committed adultery physically I dare say there's not many people here tonight that haven't committed it in your mind by using your eyes preach brother Donnie I doubt there's a person sitting in this building tonight that hasn't fallen short of the glory of God this very week Amen brother Donnie preach we're with you that's right so you realize it's going to be the grace of God that's going to get us all there in the first place so this child that's actually going to be produced from Judah himself will step into the leverate law of the firstborn because the others now of course have died so Judah is going to be the one that will be the king of tribes so go so far God has blessed that his family would be one of the five families notice five Grace so here FZ will be one of the five families of Judah but out of him will come the kingly line now we would look at it naturally and think that the one that put his hand out of his mother's womb and they tied the carded cord around him we would think he would be the one because he had the scared cord and scared was the sign of redemption but that wasn't the way God went in this particular case but what God did was he bypassed the one that put out his hand first and he pulled it back in and his brother which broke the breach which went beyond his brother which tuck his hand out so it was in the breaking of the breach that God types his own Humanity coming to the earth now we would look at it natur and say well it's got to be zero there ain't no way in the world God is going to use FIS but you see God is foreshadowing even the elect that will come many many Millennia after that do you understand that that Tamar carrying this and giving birth to these two sons it was a very reflection of me it was a reflection of you I should have come forth that original one from the mind of God I should have come forth that very seed of God but instead of me coming forth which one the one who broke the breach which is Donnie Reagan the human being not Donnie Reagan the seed of God I should have been the one Eve actually should have been my mother not Betty Jane Reagan Betty Jane Reagan should have never been my mother it should have been Eve that should have been all of our mothers and my father should have never been Don Reagan my father should have been Adam that Adam would have took the book of life and he would read those names pronounce those names and spoke us into existence and we would have come to her one by one by one by one but instead of going that way then we broke the natural path so we bypass the theophany and then we come to the order of Fes and God said all right because of that me knowing that I will come come the same way so instead of me coming on the earth now God the spirit God could have made him another second Adam the exact same way he made the first one so the Lord God could have went in the in the Garden of Gethsemane he could have went over on Mount hermod he could have went in you know the down the valley of Jehoshaphat he could have went wherever he wanted he could have stooped down as it were and created another human being that never come forth from a virgin and he could have breathed into him the Breath of Life just like it did the first Adam and he could say now you are the second Adam you are the Son of God you will die for my people but he wanted to come through the same way the phz come which was how breaking the womb so the Lord God chose the same path for his own Humanity now want you notice that phz in actually being the son of Judah by Tamar which was a questionable Affair in the first place but remember Tamar is not doing this because of lust she is not doing this because she wants to be with a man but there is something inside of her that is calling for a son from Judah himself from Judah himself not from Sheila not from a not from the other that was something down inside of her remember her womb had not been broken from her first husband or the second but it was from the kingly line that it brought forth and it was something inside of her that she was longing for she didn't even have a scripture to back it up but there was something there drawing her to fulfill it she just couldn't let it go how many understands that feeling tonight you just can't let it go now what you notice then in verse 13 so Boaz took Ruth and she was his wife and when he went in unto her the lord gave her conception and she be a son I want you to notice the hypocrisy of our government not only our government but many of the governments of the world that if you any of you tonight was a a small child and you put your child in the wrong type of car SE or if a policeman goes by and sees that your child is underage and your child is not even in a car seat and they stop you they pull you over they can write you a ticket depending on the attitude of the cck Ain no tell Wonder World they do to you yet yet a woman can take the life of that child before it's born and it's her rights I heard the other day of a man that they found him guilty several years ago Scott Peterson was his name and the man has been trying to get his trial redone you know it's been many many years but he killed his wife and she was pregnant with her child well when they found this man guilty they found him guilty on two accounts of murder and yet this baby had not been born and I'm trying to wrap my hillbilly mind around this okay so we're going to charge this man with murder because he kills this unborn child in the mother and yet women do it every day and they say it's their rights whatever I want to do with my body don't tell me what to do with my body keep your hands off of my body come on Happy Valley or Word of Life excuse me but you realize now with the law of the land how hypocritical that it is that a baby has more rights in a car seat than it does in his mother's room it has been said it is one of the most deadly places for a child to be in its mother's womb what a shame oh my but aren't you glad that God has women on the earth and down through time that felt it their charge it was so something within these women that they wanted to do it I'll tell you one thing I'm certainly glad that my mama never had no abortion whenever she found out she's pregnant with me I'm glad my mama didn't have no abortion when she found out that she was pregnant with my brother and my other brother and my sisters I'm so glad that your mama didn't have an abortion with you and you and you and you are you all glad are you glad your mama didn't do such a thing aren't we glad that Abraham Lincoln's Mama didn't have an abortion with him come on somebody what about brother Brandon's Mama aren't you glad she didn't have no abortion on and on and on we could go don't you see how that God is the one who gives conception and God is the one that gives what the Bible calls children as a Heritage from the Lord don't we appreciate our mothers don't we appreciate women thank God go ahead give them a hand that's all right now you find I find this amazing because Boaz was now an old man according to history between 80 and 80 and 90 years old something like that and Rose here at the state to where she's at whenever we look at him going into her she had married her husband over in the land of Moab he was a young man she was a young woman and yet there was no Union between them that produced a child so Boaz goes in unto her and the lord gave her conception so it was a singular Act of God's divine blessing so she bear a son and the women said unto Naomi blessed be the Lord which hath not left thee this day without a Kinsman now here the women are talking to Naomi and they say that God has given Naomi a Kinsman and they aren't talking about Boaz but they calling oit oit was Naomi's Kinsman also and her Redeemer he is going to be a restorer of her youth now keep in mind the 144,000 in the Millennium now all this time a lot of the focus has been on Ruth the more about us but watch after Ruth and Boaz come together and that Union Oh Glory that Union she begins to bring forth now the focus again changes alone from Ruth back on Naomi now Naomi is being blessed Naomi is being showered the blessings of God but look at one of the reasons why because Naomi focused everything she did not on herself she focused it on who Ruth her Focus was RSE and RSE is going to be the very one that God is going to use to pull Naomi back in to the Blessed state of God's approval again now what's so unselfish see don't ever think friends that living for others is not rewarding I'm here to tell you tonight it is eternal life when you're living for others oh I get so sick of dealing with people that's so self-centered it's all about them you know it's people in church the same way they don't like the heat they don't like this they don't like the air they don't like the music they don't like the color of the carpet why in the world did y'all use one color of carpet there and another one up here calls I wanted it thus that's why when you donate as much as I did then I'll let you make the votes okay and when you become pastor and you start your own church then you can do whatever you want to but until you do you're coming to mine and you ain't the boss here well Glory who in the world was that for my my so you see God had Naomi this is like a burden that she could not find rest herself somehow until she found rest for Ruth so she's instilling in Ruth Al light the rights and the laws of the lever law and the rights of redemption and trying to educate her and bring her to that spot to where Ruth don't know what to do she tells Ruth to go up to the threshing floor she tells her how to dress she tells her to get off her garments of widowhood and put on the garments fit for a bride and she's instructing her all of her whole focus is about Ru now God said because your attitude has been that way now I'm going to redeem you and the woman said unto Naomi blessed be the Lord Lord which hath not left thee this day without a Kinsman that his name may be famous in Israel now watch notice again Naomi moves to the cner of the theme so they witnessed now remember they were some of the same women no doubt that saw Naomi come to to the water and there was a well there of course in Bethlehem as they would build their cities around either Springs or Hidden Springs or they would dig a well there and the people at all of them didn't have water wells in their home so they would come to the city they live outside in the areas we've been there and seen how they still do that and they would come and bring their buckets so they would see her as she come in and they saw the weariness on her face and they ask her how is everybody how's El melik how's it always dead what about meon he's dead oh my they saw how distraught she was and how sad and they thought oh I I wish there was something we could do for the 144,000 I I mean the me I wish there's something that we could do for them poor old Jews you know they killed them they burned them they done everything in the world to them I wish there was something we could do but the Lord saying don't worry I'll take care of them I'll get them back the light is fixing to change again Ruth when we come to our fullness our Union with Christ Jesus will lead into the Millennium and produce the son of David and when the son of David sits on his throne the Millennium Temple will be built in Ezekiel 44 the tribes will set outside and they will have their entry points and all the worship and all this that they will do why brother Donnie why do we need in the Millennium Naomi has got to be appeased you see in the Eighth Day in the city John said I saw no Temple but he didn't say that in the Millennium now I know that the Third Temple is going to be rebuilt under the administration of the Antichrist and Satan will incarnate himself Jews Gentiles alike will go there to worship and they'll think it's God but we as Believers are not waiting for that Third Temple we're waiting for the Millennium Temple now they saw her as she entered in the city with such sadness and the burden and once they found out that Ruth was a mbius they knew oh why did Naomi do this why didn't she leave that Gentile back there poor saying it's going to bring so much of a burden on her because there was such a strain between them the moabites were constantly running over the border of Israel and they were raiding them and they would steal their cattle and steal livestock as so says Josephus and some of the other historians and they would go in their Conant so there was this constant Rift between them and here comes Naomi back and she's already burdened and heavy laden and she brings with her a gentile a gentile oh my what in the world was she thinking what did she have in her mind well it probably was beyond her because God wanted her back into the Homeland you see us Gentiles also have a Homeland and the prophet of God identified what it was our homeland is the message of the hour the word of God that's been restored back to the bride that's why we are not giving up our homeland they can fight they can do what they want to call us all kinds of names whatever we will stand and fight cuz we have been restored to our homeland now notice in verse 15 and he shall be unto thee a restorer of life and a nourisher of thine old age grandchildren actually have this ability brother Fred Mullen says they don't call him grand for nothing brother Homer Longoria says it's wonderful to see them head lights coming and them tail lights going you can love on them and send them home to their parents of course SPO them up oh my and he notice now what they're saying that OED OED in this line of David will be a restorer of her life what's he going to do he's going to make her feel young again you ever notice people when they get around a baby how most all of them go to talking baby talk D D D D and the little baby said m m oh yeah and you I wonder what them babies are thinking what are you all doing to my chin what this is weird why are you all doing that to me there's wonder why that is Wonder Why when we get around children and we watch them and oh they'll bring a smile to the grumpiest of people they're just something about it oh I seen Harry as he saw how smitten I was with our first set of twins as Courtney and they were smitten too I've seen how he watched Us and how we were smitten with both sets of the Parker twins but now Harry is nothing but a soft Doty oh grandpa Karen don't you laugh you're a soft o doie Grandma so you know what there's something about it ask Jude when he gets to the place if he can talk is there anything that he wants that Mom and Pops and Lala and Daddy and Grandpa and uncle Donnie and everybody else want get for him because there's something about it oh my you realize what it will do when the son of David comes back in the Millennium and sets up the Kingdom on the earth and Israel as a nation as Gentiles we won't be separated by nationality that won't be an American section and a and a German section and an Italian section we will all just live all mingled together like we do now but in the Millennium Israel will be a nation under the administration of the son of David Naomi will come back to her use again praise God he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life and a nourisher of thine old age for thy daughter-in-law which loveth thee which is better to thee ah seven sons this is not Seven Brides for Seven Brothers but his seven bride ages for one son of man Son of God Son of David now what these women said to us it doesn't mean that much to them for them to compare one woman to Seven Sons Sons meant seed seed meant hirs hirs meant potential priest potential priests potential Kings but yet these women saw something in this Gentile moritis that was greater than seven sons praise be to God Amen which hath borne him so OED was a restorer of Naomi's life her youth bringing her back to a place imagine whenever she'd come to the well and she'd have them all wrapped up some of you that seen pictures of of the way they do in Africa and India and different parts of the world how they wrap them babies on the front here of the back boy they go out there and pick cotton or beans or whatever it is they're doing and then babies just slung around everywhere out there then Mama's out there working they'll bend over you know they just keep it going you imagine whenever Naomi come I mean she was proud as I don't know what she walked in there said oh oh let me see him little s let me see him what's his name we called him worshipper oh bad we called him worshipper they didn't call him all dry they didn't call him oh old old pucker you know sit down with your lips all po a nobody told me how to worship God but we called him worshipper because we had an Insight that by his birth worship would be restored back in your life now remember she had a lot of sadness she had a lot of GL we all know how it is it's hard sometimes to praise God when you feel all down in the mouth isn't it it's hard to praise God when things are going against you it's hard to praise God when the Lord has took a loved one out of your life and you felt like you couldn't live without him it's still hard to say Lord I love you Lord I praise you but what happened God had sent one that's going to be a restorer and they gave him the right name worshiper you imagine all the way from her house to the well Lord God I want to thank I want to thank you for this baby I never thought I'd ever feel this way I felt like God I felt like I was at the end of my road I felt like I'd never be happy again don't you accept that if God is our let me tell you friends if you haven't experienced it yet you probably will sometimes the will of God in our lives can be so painful amen it can exact such a price from our lives because this pleases him to do thus and so and we're looking we're trying to understand it we're trying to figure it out you imagine the loss of losing her husband the loss of losing two sons going back finding her property all run down no money no social security no way to get along no way to do anything yes and she said go God has made me bitter boy she had an attitude she had a lot to praise God for now didn't she she she had this human this little human flesh wrapped up in her arms Oh Glory to God it's like she got a new lease on life it's just like she just I I I've got something to live for I've got something I really do I never thought I'd ever be happy again I never thought I'd ever had a reason to smile I've just been so gloomy and so sad she might have said but I have got a reason to live I've got a promise with a name I've got a promise with a name her unselfishness is rewarded oh praise God and hereby thinking more of Roose than herself God brings her from the sidelines and puts her right in the middle of the screen again and said Naomi I'm talking to you oh you mean I'm not done you're not done you mean you've got more for me to do I sure do well what is [Music] it and some of y'all are looking for some great spiritual son oh I God Brother Don I'm looking to cast out Devils sisters there's never a woman in the book of Acts that cast out Devils that had a prayer line there's never one in the aping Epistles has never one that God ever used him that way you think you're not going to get a great reward sure you are in many ways you overcome more than us men do but it's not by going around and casting out devils and healing the S but it's being Alik praying for your pastor praying for the ministry of God doing everything you can reaching out to the young people offering prayer for them praying for them help prepare a meal for them come on somebody every one of us have got something we can do but it may not be glorious anybody willing to pick up some of the trash on the parking lot besides me anybody willing to kill a few weeds out here in these beds beside me brother T Lord you you don't mean to tell us that you me what yes I kill weeds yes I pick up rocks yes I move this that I so happy the Lord's give us this place so if I can pick up trash I do whatever I can do do I want to let the Lord know I'm packing this baby Hallelujah I didn't give birth to it but glory to God he put it in my charge my my I am so happy with our place I'm so thanful the Lord has give us such a place like this so we can have meetings like we're fixing to have this weekend why in the world shouldn't we be happy why should we be grateful to God look what a place we've got to worship God in look what a place the Lord's given us for our young people look at what a place we've got for the Sunday School of kids then you say oh I ain't got nothing to be happy about no some of you spending too much time growling and complaining because you don't get your way on this and that and the other you ought to be so grateful to God tonight that God has given us a house where we can worship him a Ministry that preaches the word brothers and sisters that love the Lord Jesus oh my men of God that's fixing to come this week and break the bread of life to us I you get done praising him for all that then Brak me your complaints and I'll give you 92335 more things to praise him for well praise be to God yes sir oh my I want you to notice this now this is her means of prosperity comfort and joy in her declining years and her declining years instead of living her life said oh Ru you go and do whatever you want to do I'm too old to help you I I'm way too tired I I worked on my life I ain't going to do enough you now I'm I'm fixing re I'm going to go back to the land of Israel I'm going to go with you mother you ain't going with me woman you'll be a burden I ain't got time for you it's amazing to me how when people get old they get so selfish so course some of them are selfish and they young and they just carried on over in their old age but they saying well I'll tell you one thing I deserve peace and rest where in the word you get that at do you understand even though Abraham was not mentioned after the light began to focus on Isaac you know where Abraham was he wasn't in the grave he was sitting back there in the tent you know where Isaac was when the light changed to Jacob he was still alive what for what was he doing no doubt giving them some training boys this is how you pray this is how you walk with God it wasn't like that they were just sitting back there and nobody ever knew they was there but it was in them silent years of life the Bible don't even mention their names until they die the next time that it's mentioned what was going on entering into this phase of their life don't live it [Music] selfishly and Naomi took the child and laid it in her Blossom and became nurse this is a form Al Act of adoption so she adopts worship as her child it's a lot better than grouchiness it's a lot better than complaining you ever find God blessing anybody for complaining constantly you ever find God mentioning anything reputable in the Bible about people that's all the time growling and complaining and grappling about this and other you ever find any blessings where Jesus said blessed are the gers for they that grath shall grap us even more and I will give them more years to grap us about so that they can grip us through eternity and they will live on gpus Avenue because their Crown is a gpus crown there's no blessings for griping there's no blessings for being contous oh the joy of the Lord is our strength not griping you imagine it didn't cross her mind God have you forgotten me God why'd you let my husband die you let both my boys die God why you let my place go to nothing I ain't got nothing to be happy about but somehow brother Paul she found it in her well the only thing I've got left is this Gentile wow what a thing to have left but I'm going to love her I'm going to take care of her Oh Glory to God and God said now me because you've done that I'm going to give you a reason to worship again so Naomi accepted the name now remember naom never named him Ruth never named him or Boaz never named him which is odd yes sir generally the parents the father would name them on occasion the mother but here it was the people who named him and they accepted the name oh so Naomi adopts him and remember she's too old to be able to him in the physical sense so it's not like that she's providing the milk you understand what I'm saying but she was the caregiver amen she's going to be real close right around where his thrown is and around where that Millennium Temple is amen so Naomi Naomi accepted the name let said Naomi accepted the name the empty one was now full again the sad one was now happy hallelujah hallelujah the bitter one was now blessed Naomi had a son how was that even possible Naomi had a son and Roose the Gentile br shared the birth of her Christus with [Applause] Naomi the Jews brought it to us we take it back to them how was all that work I don't know but I know God will figure it all out know exactly what to do now actually whenever it says son which is the word Ben B it also means grandson or great-grandson so in other words it means that you are a descendant from so this child became the grandfather of King David you imagine when little Naomi was packing little worshipper around and he'd go to dancing a little bit little worshipper you know she'd stand him up by the well there in Bethlehem and maybe they'd come around with the music you know go to singing them Jewish songs and little olded would get down there and dancing Oh my he was packing his grandson he was in him in seed form no wonder he loved to dance and worship God that was his Granddaddy's name worshiper I wonder what if we as Grandparents could be able to impart to our children well glory to God I wonder if we'd have more Worship in grandparents if we might have more Worship in young people if we'd have more Worship in parents if we might have more Worship in young people look young people worship is not just for oldtimers it's for every son and daughter of God every young man every young woman every old man every old woman ought to worship [Applause] God and the women her neighbors gave it a name now to me this within itself is a miracle that they could all agree on one name think of it you mean tell some want Ben some of them want Fred some of them want Malachi some want Elijah some say Elijah ain't a good name go Elisha others say jeroboam others say zephani other say hay but all of a sudden the spirit of God came down on them and they all begin to say worshiper worshiper that's what he needs to be called OED worshipper why he's the very epitome of his grandmother he's the very epitome of his mother mother don't you think that Ruth was a worshipper after all that God did for that woman I imagine she was one of the shoust Gentile women in the Old Testament she could shout and praise God because God had mercy on her and God let her H upon the field of Boaz and God let her marry boad and not only that but she's in the very natural lineage of the Lord Jesus Christ him one of these days you'll look down the streets of gold and there come this beautiful young woman she'll be running n miles an hour shouting and praising God said who in the world was that they said Ruth some more about us said she ain't calm down since the Lord got a hold of her back in the Old Testament that woman runs down through these streets shouting and praising God I guess I'll take off right behind her Carol honey I'll grab you by the hand and here we'll go glory to God glory to God Ruth I preached on you I preached on you over and over and over again God bless you Ruth God bless you I'm still trying to catch up with her she's still going oh glory to God glory to God I was so about us I was lost and of course I guess some of you will be doing the same thing then that you do now I see somebody sometimes you just sit there and shake your head you just that I thought I thought when he got so old he would finally slow down who lied to you if I get old y'all have to push me out in the wheelchair I'll be one the flying his preachers in a wheelchair you ever seen in your life I'll be going back and forth across this platform and this pull pit Hallelujah brother Greg Park sent me a little video clip not long ago of a of a black preacher how old was he brother Greg 100 101 something like that man that old God was up there just a preaching in a jumping and a shouting he said this is you at 101 I said glory to God Amen that's me I've got something to praise him for I've got something to worship him for and the women her neighbors gave it a name my neighbors give me one too but they worship her saying there is a son born to me it was a miracle but brother Donnie I mean genetically I mean DNA and I well you see the difference between her and us is she didn't understand DNA she wasn't worried about SS all she knew was she was miserable and now she was happy all she knew was she was so sad and felt like her days was gone but now God had restored her joy and she be to see more about the will of God so what if Mayon would have lived what if elik would have lived and they would have come back from the land of MOA and and Ruth would have been married to that other man you know what God knew exactly the whole story I don't know how I got to be honest I don't know how but I believe that b Sheba was ordained to be David's wife from the foundation of the world and maybe your RI would have got killed in the exact same battle that he died in and David got a held of the plan of God and run ahead of it and messed up the program of his own life but God cannot be outdone and he will take things that look sometime horrible and he'll make it fit in his will and his glory I told Carol the other day I got a certain text from just dealing with a certain situation here in the church I told Carol I ready turn said you know I said Satan loves to put me in these spots where it seems like there's no way out yeah that no matter what decision I make and what I do there is no answer so I'm killed either way there ain't no El she kind of paded me on the shoulder I said but you know what also is awesome because I have seen Our God come in those situations time and time and time again and when it looked like there was no way out he said step out of the way Donny I'm good at making way out of places when there ain't no way out come on Saints you know what I'm talking about you've seen the same thing in your life what does God do he drops you an old bed in your arm and then you can say praise the Lord I didn't know how in the world I was going to get out of this and God moov some of you sisters here tonight you want a baby you want a baby and you not been able to receive in the name of Jesus receive your promise you're needing healing oh my goodness I read today where the prophet of God said that the men of God in this last day will stop cancer they will stop diseases I believe that's the hour we're living in what God will drop an O bed into our arms [Applause] let me get my breath I'm good there is a son born to Naomi and they called his name H he is the father of Jesse the father of David so out of worship comes Jesse I don't know if Jesse was a shouting man or not but I know as it come on down they produced One OED would not only bring a blessing to Naomi to Ruth to boas he would bless the entire city of Bethlehem he would bring Fame to the tribe to the city and it seemed like El's name would disappear out the genealogies but since Judah had come down with Tamar and it comes right on down now as the seed passes right on down to where Boaz takes Ru Hallelujah under the leverate marage you understand who he was who Obed was he's reckon down identified as El's seed so he's identified as the firstborn Oh Glory to God hallelujah don't you understand every one of you is got the Holy Ghost tonight you're standing right there as if though you was with the original 120 on the day of Pentecost you've got the same Holy Ghost they got you've got the same Birthright my Lord Jesus here it comes open Jesse David Jesus whether he had a slang in his hand or a song book or a Psalm book David was is a servant of God now remember according to the book of Deuteronomy a moit could not come into the congregation of the Lord for 10 Generations I wonder what some of us legalists would have done we would have stood right there in the Old Testament said it's an abomination in the eyes of God is anybody counted how many generations it was up to David they were not to enter into the congregation of the Lord but the little book of Ruth closes with a 10 generation genology and climaxes with the name David is the r or defined Deuteronomy no but he's showing when the law is against you don't ever underestimate Grace glory to God Ruth 4:18 now these are the generations of phz phz beget hron hazon begat ram ram begat aidad aidad begat naan naan begat Salon Salon begat Boaz and Boaz begat OED and OED begat Jesse and Jesse begat David so the 10th Generation by the book of Deuteronomy David was left out right amen good Grace said come on in David and ain't no wonder that man shouted and ain't no one of that man Shang sang and worship God it ain't no one of that man praise the Lord like none other one of the writers said it this way I thought this is so beautiful I just wanted to share it with you we have a delightful ending to the book of Ruth which contrast greatly with its beginning it began with remorse but it ends with rejoicing it began with death but it ends with life it began with dishonor for God but it ends with honor for God it began as a cloudy stormy day threatening to Devour the people involved in the book but it ends with the sun shining brightly we like books that end this way don't you like the end of that book and all lived happily every after we know in reality life ain't that way but let me tell you something tonight you are part of a book little Roose that you can read your end of your story and I'm telling you tonight you are going to live happily ever after you will never die there will be no more pain no more sickness no more heartache but we need to note that the good conclusion of the Book of Ruth was to do with the Good Conduct of some of the people in The Book of Ruth Matthew 1:1 and I'll close the book of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham you mean to tell me the Lord Jesus was not ashamed for his next of kin in the Book of Matthew now if you understand the genealogies you know many times they would not list each generation but they would skip some which is exactly what Matthew did it was just his style of writing so it didn't go down through all of them but he said the book of the generation of Jesus Christ so here's Jesus Christ and he jumped to the son of David and the son of Abraham Abraham begat Isaac and Isaac begat Jacob and Jacob they got Judas and his Brethren want you to notice who's named first and the only one named in the chronology of Matthew Judah Judas Greek for Judah Hebrew the Old Testament why kingly tribe children don't you understand this is what separates the bride from the church the bride comes from the King tribe Lord God it's not our goodness it's not any good thing that we've done he chose us to be part of the king tribe glory to God and Judas beg ferah and Zarah of famar and farz begat Isam and Isam begat AMR and amram begat ababab and ababab begat Nan and Nan begat salon and Salon begat booze Boaz of RA and Boaz began open of Ru Lord God should I say it the end of the book will declare it thus I'm the Lord Jesus big act to Millennium of his wife the Gent briad I read it last night where brother R said before Jesus can come there's got to be a Ministry on the earth that will be so like the Ministry of the Lord Jesus that it will cause the resurrection of the Dead it ain't no wonder the devil hates a Ministry in this message you ever thought about it he hates a Ministry in this message worse than any message it's been since the church ages have been going on there's only one one body that ever thought the ministry is hard that's why the lot of the message people do you who that is Catholics Catholics let Satan fight the Lord Jesus will produce a Ministry on the earth that'll be some much like him don't you understand what it is it's the continuation of his ministry every God called man no matter where he preaches fast slow medium speed every God called man that's called by God is carrying on the ministry of the Lord Jesus himself don't you understand this is why the administration of the son of man the son of man is still here and someon beet Boaz of raob and Raab and Boaz be opit of Roose but do you understand that Rahab lived between 250 and 300 years before this in the Book of Ruth you didn't know that you need to spend more time in your Bible and said on Facebook you mean Rahab lived 250 to 300 years and yet it identifies her as boaz's mother well Bo I got some of y'all's attention this a first time tonight but glory to God I done her didn't [Laughter] I but you see in the way they would write the genealogy it doesn't mean that it was his direct mother but a descendant boy when I found this I thought now I get it now I get it I heard brother Brandon preaching the other day 90 mil an hour on the Mighty God unveil before us in philadelph Pennsylvania and he was preaching about Benjamin Franklin preaching about you know all these great men in America and they said I was there with Paul River I was there with George Washington I I I I waved that icy River there then he went back and said I was with Abraham when he went up on top of that mountain and I thought that's it that's it not that I was there literally but by identification it's in my genealogy I was there with David when he reached down and up them five smooth stones out of that rock glory to God when I stood over there five or six years ago in that same dry bed and I reach down there and F my pockets full of them rocks I used one the other night over at brother Josh benach you ought have seen them people's eyes when I drug that out of my pocket and I said this Little Rock right here come from the same branch of water oh my iot packing that rock of land you never know when you run into a giant that might need to be slain I realize why I identify with David I realized I wasn't there when them Seven Seals was open when the angels of the Lord made his wig but by seed by genealogy I was there Hallelujah I was not there physically when he raised from the dead but by representation I was there you were there [Applause] there was sinfulness and four out of five of the women that Matthew mentions Gentiles Tamar Rahab Canaanites Ruth moabitas Beth Sheba a Canaanite all blocks and marks on the lineage how many of you would want to tell that's where you come from naturally any of y'all want to tell there's a prostitute in your line yeah y'all want to tell this a harlot back up one or two but can you imagine Matthew as he's sitting there writing Lord should I say it should I not should I hide it from him you imagine Jesus said don't hide it I'm going to save some just like it glory to God oh God Roose Tamar whatever your name is this Jo Jo the ranks of the redeemed let us find our position we don't hear it preach much in our message I know but in the Book of Joel there's a great prophecy that speaks about this brow in the last days and Joel identifies her as an army and Jo all says there's one identification that she'll have she will not break ranks in other words if God called her to be a sergeant or a tater Peter or a tater washer she don't have to be in charge and let everybody acknowledge her same with men so if God called a man to be an associate to another man he will not break ranks in order to do his own thing which is very hard to do it's very hard to do cuz some men get to thinking I I'm greater than this I I'm bigger than this I've got more gifts but in this Army there'll be no breaking of rank and if they do break they will come back and find their position cuz we're going to present to our lord Jesus the host on the earth yeah the prophet was out there what was it 1961 him and some of the brothers is looking up at the sky at night and he said they tell me he said I've Len I've never been able to find it but they say there's all kinds of different things up there he said later we went to bed that night I got to lay in there I got to thinking about all that order in that heavenly host and I got to thinking about the disarray in the Earthly Host this one getting out of their spot and that one out of their spot and that one don't you want to just get in your spot and stay there just be whatever God's called you to be brother brother the Don I've got so many more gifts but remember if God knows you've got more gifts he will place you I wish preachers could understand this I wish preachers could to understand you don't make doors for yourself I've dealt with so many through the years and you try to advise them and try to help them and it's like oh I've got to go oh man I want to you know and you know what a lot of them do they will call other preachers to preach for them I I'm passing through I want to preach for you that's one of the worst things a preacher can do to me I think God deals on both ends I'd rather have three doors that God opened up for me then 30 I opened up for myself amen sir I'll be able to accomplish more with them three doors that God gave me but I'm telling you friends I know you don't deal with a Ministry that much person many of you don't me brother darl talk about it all the time it's it's just pitiful some of the young preachers in this message they're wanting to be seen so bad and heard so bad and they're willing to ride on the coat tail of that preacher that preacher that preacher that preacher show up at this meeting and that meeting and that meeting and and let everybody know they're a preacher cuz they're looking for a door and you think what good is it going to accomplish come on now God has to give men their favor come on somebody don't sit there and look at me and be quiet if God gives you three songs to sing sing them with all your heart brother my if you clap your hands and every now and then you miss a beat well clap them sing with all your heart sing with all your might do I well I wish I could sing like brother Harry well I do too but I can't I was never jealous of Harry in any way except one way he was Erica's favorite singer and I never did like that I got to say I don't blame her but what we want set me Lord set me in my rank and if we all in this church will'll find our place and be there but I'll give you a good little clue okay you watch people that's always want to do this that and the other watch and see how they treat the leaders above them that'll tell you if they're called of God to lead or not cuz a real leader can be led but a stubborn hard-headed goat that will not take advice from the pastor counsel from the Deacon always bucking against I don't care what you decide they're always against it that shows you right there they're not a godall leader on they are a Hitler there must be some bad people streaming tonight you poor little dear Darlings I'm so sorry that y'all had to get whooped around this way tonight some of you sorry outfits on that stream and would you shut down so I can talk to these little sweet angels the last few minutes oh Naomi don't let your life go down in bitterness amen look friends our family has had a our own little taste of this in the last bit the Lord taken Erica oh yeah do we understand no but we are refusing Lance we're refusing girls to let the will of God by taking our here little Erica Rob us of our joy or brother Junior robbing yours sister jitty or others of you here do I understand it no can it be painful very but I'm waiting for God to drop an oit in my arms so maybe you're here tonight and you're going through a bitter time in your life don't let that Crown your life let the Lord Jesus give you that expectation and me loves him with all your heart God bless you Saints I thought about not having church tonight I thought well you know what we're going to have church Friday night and Saturday night and Sunday morning but then I thought man why in the world would we want not want to have Wednesday night let's just go and have another know W Out Boy am I glad we did praise the Lord I know you've been praying about our meetings and I want you to continue to do so and the Lord puts it on your heart you know these next few days before the meeting start please let's just keep them in prayer praying for the ministering brothers that God will lead them I I mentioned this here brother Daryl and I have been praying about a prayer line whether or not to have it um and he's he text me the other day and said he felt felt like it wouldd be a good thing for us so Lord willing will be having that on on uh Saturday night we'll start the service at 6 o'clock on Saturday so we can be able to accommodate the people and all so let's just come expecting the Lord to move hey you know he drunks liers horners thieves invite them invite them you understand friends where we are since we've been here in our church we have had the office bunch of visitors ever was I was told Sunday we had the office bunch of visitors it was unbelievable how many visitors would hear now you know what a lot of preachers do when they see that they start compromising they go to cutting back on what they say on Sunday morning and they'll say that for Wednesday night and they quit preaching to the mature bride hopefully to get more well the way I look at it if they're a seed they may be dressed up like a jezebel but this may be the very thing they're looking for so if I water it down and and you know just make it where I sound like everybody else they say well just another church but if they hear stuff from Plum across the horizontal rainbow and they're thinking Lord have mercy what in the world was they talking about and they leave just bum Fogle they don't think what to even say but then they think wow Lord I think I'm going back I think why it may be exactly the very thing they're looking for don't expect me to compromise because we're having visitors to show up be nice to them you may have to cover your eyes on some of them but they might be the last one what if it's a last one and she looks like a jezebel oh my let's expect God to do great things among us and he believes it God bless you I love you so much let's pray together oh thank you tonight Jesus thank you thank you maybe there's some tonight father they've been going through such a Time such sadness bitterness seems there's no way out help them Lord I know we've got several in our

did what we thought our participation level whether we just looked whether we acted whether we clapped our hands or didn't clap our hands Lord God I trust father that what I said the way I said it was pleasing to you you're the one I Look to as a violinist that stood on the platform and played so many years ago as the prophet tells us the story and he played so beautifully tears are brought to the eyes of p and cheers to others and they clapped and they applauded and again and again and he just stood there but he was looking for his teacher cuz he wanted his approval so he scans the audience until he can find the Mastro that taught him Lord God I I love to hear that the people were blessed and they were helped but after each service I preach I want to know that the master himself could say Donnie I was pleased I pray that each of us father would get that understanding in our heart every service we attend every singer every musician that they'll place that first then when they leave that service that you can say to them I was so pleased by the way you participated in church tonight I was so pleased the way you amened the word I was so pleased that you clapped your hands I pray Lord God I'll never leave a service whether I'm preaching or not that you'll ever say to me I was so displeased with you Donnie you just did not have a good attitude you didn't get in you didn't
