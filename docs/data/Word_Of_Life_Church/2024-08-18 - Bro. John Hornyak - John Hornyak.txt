are bound by drugs alcohol promiscuity all of these things be encouraged just a few weeks ago I was in in South Carolina and a brother gave a testimony young guy in his 30s he spoke about a life on the street and being bound by drugs and when I was speaking to his mom later I know her and and the dad and is a minister of the Gospel I preached for him uh down through the years but uh um he was out on the street for 19 years 19 years Bound by a demon of drugs and sometimes um you know we we may not experience and go through what others are going through but a devil is a devil is a devil and we are the people of God are we not and the Bible tells us in the Book of Romans that blindness in part has happened it's a mystery Paul says blindness in part has happened to to to the Jews until the fullness of the Gentiles become come in and all the turmoil and things that are going on in that land today are for my benefit for your benefit in order that we can receive the fullness of the power of this gospel we've been United to Joseph and it's about our time to be taken out of the room in order that he can reveal himself to his Brethren so let's do all that we can if you know of a of a dad a mom that's going through something with their child don't shy away from them I know it may be uncomfortable to talk about it sometimes but these are things that God has given us the power to stand against and we are a body we are to be United together so if you know a mom a dad that's going through something you go and put an arm around them and you go pray with them in their situation that God will bring them their their child out of that condition we are the people of the chosen We Are The Chosen generation that's amen let us pray Heavenly Father we give you honor we give you glory we give you praise and these names on these pieces of paper the the the testimonies and things that we've heard already this morning of what you've done Lord we stand firm in who we are sure sometimes we get discouraged sure sometimes we get weighted down with the with the busyness and the the craziness and the pressures of this age in which we live but father you have anointed us to stand you've put a word within us that can speak to a storm just as you did that day on the sea when you said peace be still those words have already been spoken and we in turn have to take those very same words upon our lips and speak to storms and maybe sometimes it's a storm in someone else's life may we speak those words over them Father we thank you for what you're going to do in this service today everything may it be For Your Glory may it be for your benefit may it be for the betterment of the kingdom may it be for the broadening of our territories and our boundaries father so may we stand in our position as the words of the song say Lord stand in our position and watch the miraculous come into action through our lips through our determination through our words through our faith that you've given to us be glorified in this service today every ounce of doubt everything of fear every situation of animosity every every cloud of Fusion that may be hanging over the people today May the word

building lord it's such a good pre-service Lord and and we're just we feel your presence now father I pray you come and anoint us Lord we ask it in your name amen if you would take your Bibles with me I'm going to turn with me to Psalms chapter 16 Psalms chapter 16 and verse one it says preserve me oh God for in thee do I put my trust oh my soul that thou Hast said unto the Lord that thou art my Lord my goodness extendeth not to thee but to the St to the saints that are in the Earth and to the excellent in whom is all my delight their sorrows shall be multip multiplied that hasten after another God their drink offerings of blood will I not offer nor take up their names unto my lips the Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup thou m mainest my lot that word lot right there means it's a properly a a pebble it's a small Stone being used for the purpose figuratively a portion or destiny so thou maintain my destiny you're the one who's in charge the lines are Fallen unto me in Pleasant places yay I have a goodly Heritage in that that word the lines that means a rope so he's he's extended a rope something you can reach out and grab amen I Will Bless The Lord who hath given me counsel my Reigns also instruct me in the night Seasons my Reigns what are Reigns for they put them on a horse and they direct a horse right his Reigns they're directing us I have set the lord always before me because he is my right hand I shall not be moved therefore my heart is glad and my glory Rejoice rejoiceth My Flesh also shall Rest In Hope that word uh rest to reside or permanently stay reside permanently stay therefore my heart is is glad and my glory rejoices My Flesh also shall rest permanently stay in Hope and hope is both the fact and the feeling of trust trust for thou will not leave my soul in Hell neither wil thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption th will show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand there are Pleasures forever more let's go to the Lord in prayer again Lord Jesus you see the scripture I I've read Lord father we just are asking that you would just come down take them Lord use them Father may you help me to expound Lord father I trust in you I believe in you and Lord I ask these things in Jesus name amen you may be seated yeah I brought a prop this is a chair if you have any questions it is a chair I went to Walmart and I was looking for yeah this was quality compared to what I what I thought I would find there this is a a chair and and the reason I I brought a chair was because a lot of you see this just as a chair right it's just a chair now it's a folding chair yeah that doesn't make a difference it's a folding chair and for most of you you just think chair but for those of us of a larger statue that's right just s for those of us who have a little bit more flesh we look at that chair and first thing we do is touch the chair lean on the chair a little bit you little people don't understand Little People come on now but for a big guy that's not just a chair that's right that could be a death trap right yeah yes sir you little people just run up and plop yourself right down but when I look at that I think I don't know brother is that going to hold me and if I sit in that chair is there going to be laughter shortly thereafter now I was listening to a podcast um and I I you know I do that I drive a lot so uh and there was a guy on there I think his name is John rich or something he's a he write he used to write country music and now he's kind of got off and and uh and he got to to talking and he he he's give his life to Christ and he's pushed all that stuff away and and all that good stuff it wasn't his podcast it was Jordan Peterson but anyway he said something that struck me and I couldn't get a I already had something planned out this week but I couldn't get away from this he said he said the difference between believing and faith is like a chair okay and I got to thinking that that's true for a big guy you little people don't understand but for a big guy that chair says a lot it is a chair yeah right but if I sit in that chair it's going to take some Faith right amen I'm putting my faith in that chair yes now this one seems to be a little bit sturdier than most I've seen But faith in that chair so let's say I I'm I've been walking standing for hours hours and I need rest come on I need some relaxation I have to put my faith in that chair so I'm going to take this tent off it's a little hot so in our Christian walk as busy as we are and as much as we go in all the things and the pressures of life don't don't expect it to get deep it's going to be real simple but I I hope it'll help you in everything that we do we say we trust Jesus Christ yes sir now Jesus Christ is never going to fail never big or small he catches them all he got but it's us who comes on the side of of failing that's right sometimes we want to go up to him and just feel it out a little bit come on come on we we're not real confident that we can fully rest in him maybe we'll just take the edge and sit real still cuz I've sit in some chairs that I've been very nervous about and you won't catch me doing any sudden movements right right that's right and sometimes that's that's our Christian walk sometimes we we we want to say we trust in Jesus Christ and and we got our all and all and everything we are good is in his hands but there better not be any sudden movements there better not be any hard problems faith is being able to rest that's what I talk about is today Lord willingness is rest yes rest really putting it down really being able to sit in your faith that's good in spite of the hard problems in spite of the hard things in spite of of the busyness of life we need to be able to rest in Jesus Christ completely trust the whole nominal world has belief right they believe brother brandham says in in God his people it says there's a fountain open freely flowing flowing freely everywhere just drink until you just can't drink no more the tree if it just drink to what it was allotted allotment why it would just always still in the drought so he's he's saying if the tree just took in exactly what it needed it would be in drought can't grow that way that that's the matter that's what's the matter with Christians they don't drink enough you want to drink till you just spread out and let somebody else see it let somebody else see it if you're not staying in the word if you're not fully invested in what Jesus Christ has done for you right right then you're just going to do enough yeah just come to church on and let other Christians know that you're a Christian you're just going to have enough but if you have faith in Jesus Christ it's the best thing ever happened to you right and you want to share that you want to let it [Music] go but if you're lacking in faith yesterday I went and to this little farmers market and got Peaches I drove my kids crazy man you got to try these peaches these peaches are great these are good peaches it's something good that I had that I wanted to share it was an experience that I had that I wanted them to have and that's the way Jesus Christ wants us to be he he he wants us to to say hey best thing ever happened to me thing best thing ever happened to me oh so let him live listen he says you want a drink till just spread out let somebody else see it push shall get a testimony right get a testimony do I have to be sick no you can have a testimony that way yeah but you could be sin sick and watch what God has done for you that's right right that's true get a testimony H commit it to God believe it step out in it on it claim God's promise just commit commit to God total commitment when I sit down I can only go about that far and then I'm yeah I ain't going no further but in that I can kick my legs out I don't know about that one but in most chairs I can really commit commit fully yes sir yes Brother s that's what we got to do we got to fully commit throw everything we are into serving Jesus Christ living for Jesus Christ resting resting right in Jesus Christ commit thy ways unto the Lord he will bring it to pass whatever you want but he can't do it until as long as you're holding to it say now if I'm any better I'll see if this will work yeah if I'm any better I'll see if this is work that's not commitment we we've heard the story about the the chicken and the pig which one is more dedicated committed to breakfast sure right right truth right that pig is committed there ain't no backpedaling from that no that's right that's what Jesus Christ wants out of our Lives total commitment a testimony yeah you commit to him forget about the rest of It Go testify of things you don't see you believe it it's not what you see it's what you believe it's not what you feel he never did say did you feel it he said do you did you believe it commitment I'm going to say that commitment rest that's how you're saved by faith that's how you're healed by faith and faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things you don't see taste feel smell or hear you just believe it act upon it as though it was amen it's fully committed yeah and we we as we go through our lives and we're we're walking and we're moving and we're we we give our hands up and say we're committed Lord All That I Am Lord everything I am right and then we come into a trouble and we come into trial it says he's in charge of our lot our destiny we give him our our our lot he we've cast our Lots with him right yes and then we have worry in our lives oh yeah is that commitment no everybody does it it's it's part of human nature everybody does it we all have that worry we hear a report from a doctor we hear you know we we we got to go to school take a test we ain't studied now I'm not saying you don't have to do your part yeah I'm not saying that you just well my path is up to you Lord you're going to be a bum it is but a Christian is not [Applause] lazy and a Christian wants to do everything that he can amen you know I've noticed here lately there is so many sign holders have you noticed that they're all holding signs homeless lost my job lost my car and they look like well aable bodied people right and it drives me crazy so you want me to go to work so I could roll down my window and give you that money now there's a different don't don't get me wrong I understand there's people that are in need and there are people that that need help I was one of those I I was never homeless but I needed help I needed that stuff but standing on the side of a road with a sign is not helping yourself right right you're not doing anything to to move yourself forward that's right good point true so some of you what a mean man I know how hard I work and maybe it is sometimes I think it's harder work for them to stand out there for 12 hours a day in 90° heat than it would be to go to an air conditioned McDonald's and get a job but yeah but people are like that that that's their mentality and they have totally committed to that right they have totally they don't there's no guarantee that somebody's going to come by and hand them something yeah right I saw one yesterday she was kneeling lady what are you doing they're committed to that their next meal depends on somebody rolling down their window and handing them two bucks and I'm sorry $2 ain't going to get you nothing right that's what they're committed to I'd rather be committed to Jesus Christ yeah cuz I know where he's going to take me and it's not always easy it's not always riy now we're going to take this this theme of rest go a little few different different places we'll see where the Lord lands it but Genesis 8 6 and 12 6- 12 and it came to pass at the end of 40 days that Noah opened up the window of the Ark which he had made and he sent forth a raven which went forth to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth also he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were Abad from the face of the ground but the dove found no rest for the so of her foot and she returned unto him into the ark for the waters were on the face of the whole earth and he put forth his hand and took her and pulled her into the into him unto him into the ark so this this this is a good example of of of listless people people just floating here and there they'll find some satisfaction and and when you were out in the world right maybe the bottle was your satisfaction that was where you rested that's where you took care of your problems right maybe it was drugs maybe it was the opposite sex maybe it was just the attention of the opposite sex that's how people felt good that's where they could rest that's where they found some satisfaction come on now but anybody who's lived that life lifestyle knows that's not really rest that's right yes sir that's just a place to light for just a second brother R takes this and he says the raven could from jump from dead body to dead body right right anything that was floating it could and and and those dead things the raven could find rest dead sure why because he was S sim uh uh where's my VOC vocabulary he was familiar with dead things because he was a dead thing yeah we go from place to place it it it might be there might be people in this church right now that that it's money it's job their job it's their that's where they find rest that's their happy place and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with having a job or or or having Recreation and and and and those kind of things but if that's what you're resting in if that's where your stop is it's all going to fade away how much can you really rest on something temporal temporary right that chair if we were to keep it around we've all seen them well maybe you haven't noticed them but I've noticed them where they're kind of the legs are kind of tweaked One Direction or the other you can still barely get them open here brother John have a chair no there's no real rest in that right right how could I be comfortable I've seen those little folding card table chairs they don't even have metal in the the front or the back they're just like cardboard it's hard for me to commit to one of those it's hard for me to rest in one of those and I really if I'm feeling lucky we ease into it and we find that that that the Christian walk what the devil wants us to do is just take a substitute just take something you can ease into it cuz we're Christians right we're Christians he knows he's not going to give us some broken down old piece of junk right right he just might bend the legs just a little bit and see if you'll commit oh wow amen you'll see if you'll commit to it that's good and once you commit to it then you're committed that's when you fall that's when it breaks now while we're right here I want to say one thing and I might have said it already but the difference between my comfort level and say brother Noah's Comfort level in that chair is flesh right right right right it's true I got a little bit more I got a lot more fleshing brother Noah say it right uhhuh it right sir so his anxiety is not going to be near what mine is when he sits in that chair so the more flesh oh yeah yes that you have on you the more you contribute to that flesh right the more that you feed the flesh come [Applause] on the more anxious you have to be about that chair that's good about that rest so as we're going through life and say we're committed to Christ the devil wants to put more of your flesh in view yes he he wants to amplify he wants you to gain some some unspiritual pounds unspiritual he wants you to be able to sit in church through a whole service and re-watch a movie right come on he wants you to be able to sit in church and count your bills come on now over and over and over again yeah yeah commitment sure all these things that we have hanging off of us all these things that we've got holding on to us right brother BR says we should be unpacking and if we're fully committed we still have to I don't want you to stop working we still have to have a job we still have to to to go to the grocery store we still have to maintain our house and so on and so forth and all those things I have never been busier in my life right than I am right now amen I know retired people yeah that are more busy now than they've ever been that's a TR that's a it's an epidemic it's something trying it's the devil's trick to get us weigh down and and so worried and so stressed out and so concerned that's right so we can't rest we can't just sit in and trust God trust God yes sir right yeah cuz for a while while as things and I'm just talking me personally for a while as things start piling on me Lord you got this you got that one too you got you got that one too don't you right right and as we go along we think God's going to get overwhelmed with our problems we think God's going to get overwhelmed with how we're going to pay the bills or or how we're going to fix this or how we're going to fix that that's right God's not going to get overwhelmed he's not going to get worried about it this the message is still the same commit commit rest rest that's good that's good nothing changes with God right I I don't know if you heard this scripture not Jesus Christ the same yesterday today I don't know if you heard that that one he's the same that's right so where does doubt and worry and and frustration and stress come from come on good it's the other guy that's right he's consistent too don't get me wrong it's how we respond to that brother John you haven't had hard problems well you don't know I got four teenagers tell me mm the dove found no rest wasn't comfortable brother and sisters we should not be comfortable y That's Right bringing certain things into our house right good that we should not be comfortable listening to certain kinds of music right those things play in our head when we sit in church but John how do you know I don't know but when we're trying to get closer to God and trying to have that faith and trying to get established in Christ and really have that that uh testimony right the devil wants to do everything he possibly can right to get you from missing this time with him that's right this time with him brothers and sisters with like Precious Faith yes sir joining together right pulling together working together he wants to get you distracted from this time where God feeds you like this you still need your personal time and we know it's easy to get distracted with when we're down on our knees or whatever more when we're praying or reading or whatever but this time I found this is when I have to catch my mind from going other places sure catch my mind from working on Monday and it's Sunday that's true I bankrupt stairs if I if I charg them for all the time I spent working up here do you understand what I'm saying but that's what the devil wants to do is he wants to get us so focused on everything else that we have to do that we have no rest can't sleep at night brother tossing in turn [Music] we have no rest because we're human we got flesh yeah it's hard for us to commit because we got this flesh we're never going to get rid of the flesh brothers and sisters we're not is the only time we're ever going to get rid of that is in a Rapture right that's that's that's when we are finally going to be free of this but our job is to exercise spiritually keep these things in check cuz let me tell you in the natural once you let it go this far right right you go to run oh my knees oh my back right yes sir I'm just being honest with you and that's the same thing with your flesh spiritually do you think that I woke up one morning and I was 300 lb ah it didn't happen like that brother right one Twinkie at a time baby how on now right it don't happen all of a sudden just like it don't come off all of a sudden that's and so the devil wants to put little things on you just a sprinkle here and a Sprinkle there and a Sprinkle there and what I found in in the natural is the reason I'm this big is because when I would dieet comes on like with a Vengeance and brings 10 more pounds of its friend that's right I had a little back when I first got married I was smaller then come on Brother come on come on and I I thought I was doing all right and I had a little doctor about this big around yeah and he sat across from me and he said Mr hornak do you know you're obese stage two I was 240 lbs oh for the day oh for the day to be 240 and this guy might have want weighed 10 60 a little bit taller to me and he said your BMI should be about 171 lbs and I looked at him and I said okay ridiculous that was ridiculous I weighed that in high school before before I worked and put on muscle so it just makes you wonder that's the way the world the SEI is my goodness why aren't you in better shape right come on why don't you have these things under control yeah that's not just the world that's you so true that's you right that weighs on yous oh my goodness I guess I'm going to fall over next week that's what they want to put on you spiritually your mind goes in places it should not go because you've committed to Christ and you make mistakes and you have this flesh right and the devil says why aren't you further along amen I thought you committed devil yes sir they want to talk to you about how out of shape he wants to talk to about how out of shape you are we all have those problems there's not anybody from the preacher the pastor I'm sure he'd tell you the same things that those mind battles don't go on that's right don't think you're alone right but what his whole goal and his whole focus in getting you in that mindset is to get you to uncommit to that rest that rest exactly he don't want you to rest he wants you to worry and stress and get out of the chair and well Jesus you ain't do nothing for me come on there's an epidemic in the young people in this church right now and I'm going just going to call it out God and I aren't [Music] talking what there's young people in this church that got in their mind and maybe it's some of these older people too that God is not talking to them because they haven't heard it fresh because they don't it's not the way they usually hear it come on that spiritual immaturity come on right rebuke that devil amen you rebuke that devil he's talking to you now that's [Applause] right he wants you to get that mindset yeah yes he does what you don't hear from God and he don't hear from you oh that's the Lord why it breaks that relationship it hinders that rest all your life you've grown up and you've heard about Jesus Christ and how he holds you and keeps you right yes sir and at The Whisper of his name he'll come down yes sir right and the devil wants to tell you good so true brother that there's no communication that's real why would he do that you will find your life getting further and further and further further away from that rest that God so desper desperately wants you to have it's a trick of the devil he doesn't always just speak to your heart or speak through preachers or that's not the only way he works don't put my God in a box right Amen brother brah said he could go outside and find God anywhere that's right and it could speak to you anywhere at any time all you have to do is go outside and look right let him speak to you right we're not talking he's trying the problem is the devil's put selective hearing on you [Applause] oh you've got this selective hearing and he's he's screaming saying hey on I want to love you like I never loved you yes sir yes sir I want to keep you like I've never kept you God's not talking to me cuz I made mistakes who in here has not made a mistake who in here has not fallen short of the glory of God so true I rebuke that devil come on Hallelujah he wants to draw closer to you he wants to talk to you he just wants you to stop letting the devil limit what he can do for you we've all heard patience is a [Music] virtue we get impatient we pray and we expect an answer yeah right we pray and we want resolution God I'm resting in your resolution okay good now let's see how much you're resting rest is a complete stop when I rest man I want I want to sit down and I just want to I don't know puddle I don't know if that's a word or expression I just want to just be there complete rest that's what God has for us uhuh a complete rest yes I meant to put at the top of my notes what time I started because I always forget in some Churches you say that and you go we just we just say it was almost almost an hour so we're going to close up here I got way way too [Music] much come on let's look at uh so we looked at the Dove and and and it just wanted to settle it says it was looking for place to settle now let's go down to uh Ruth 1 nine and 10 this is Naomi speaking said the Lord grant you that you may find rest each of you in in the house of her husband then she kissed them and they lifted up their voice and wept and they said unto her surely we will return with thee unto thy people now this word rest is the feminine and it it says specifically matrimonial so she's telling orpa and Ruth go from here here find rest go find a husband go find a rest in your house with a husband and we know that they wept bitterly and they they said no we'll go with you but there was one that wasn't committed to that statement right there was one that just said you know what probably be okay if I went back to my people there were mobites found a husband and just that was my life yeah so in the feminine I don't know if too many girls that don't want to get married there might be some out there I don't know this new age New World thing I don't I don't know gentlemen want to get married they want to find that rest they want to ease in to that happiness but I will tell you not by experience this is one thing I haven't experienced if you marry the wrong one you're not going to find any rest that's right right it's going to be miserable right so true brother it's going to be hard to come home to an unhappy lady or man and it only lasts so long that's right the honeymoon will come to an end that's right and if you can't find the right one and be patient and pray to the Lord for the right one well I'm going to be an old maid better you be an old maid than be married to the wrong one right that's right no one will ever love me you got lots of people that love you if God's called you to that life he's called you to it and he'll help you get through it but you don't want to marry the wrong one that's right seen it over and over and over and over and over again yes sir but yet we got Testaments of the ones right here I think of of of even brother Rob and Sister Sarah they they didn't come to the Lord till after they were married and had kids that's Grace they still get along right brother [Laughter] Rob but that's the grace of God right and if you can find and wait on the Lord right cuz I I I know you you get to a certain age and you you you become lonely true you get lonely and you could have a room I could remember in Arizona I wasn't serving the lord at the time but I have people in my house constantly sitting on the edge of the bed being so lonely with people all around me just lonely and we don't rest in the promise that God said sure he'll provide he'll get you with the right person you can have happiness and joy and all those things if you don't get out ahead of God Amen so Ora gave up she went back she wasn't committed into what she said I'm going to go where you go and and and and what we tend to think sometimes I think we get this out of skew a little bit but Naomi was backslid right her whole family was backslid they shouldn't have been there in the first place yet she was going back to the Homeland she was committed she had nothing fully committed she was ready to sit in that chair in spite of all that she had against her and Ruth was right there with her that's the other thing maybe we should just touch on right before I close because I I'm I'm not going to wear you out Ruth Naomi wara their husbands I can't call them all my memory is not that good they were all backslid in the wrong land so if they were just going wild you think how how much you think Jehovah came up in that conversation that's right the problem was Naomi's husband wasn't committed to the promise right and so when he wasn't committed to the promise it's not that he he stopped being Jewish it's not that he wanted to to start sacrificing his children to to the moab's god or anything like that he just he just wasn't fully committed right to what God had said he would do yeah yes sir right so what did he he threw his whole family in a tail spin right the whole thing got out of cater the whole thing warped and put him in a place that they should have never been amen that's right you see families moving away from church not necessarily this church or any church but just moving for a job or moving for this or that uhoh come on uh-oh that's right go on down to Moab you don't have a place to feed and you don't have a place that you can really get fed and don't have Fellowship you're in trouble right and so this man I wish I would have looked up his name put his whole family in a place where they truly couldn't rest can you imagine them going down the street down to the grocery store and they see A procession what's that what what what's that oh we're we're going now we're going to offer sacrifice to g day God really I I don't see no Lambs right I don't see no goats no turtle doves H what where's your sacrifice oh it's this little girl here right they didn't plan for that that wasn't in the brochure right right and yet they found themselves in that situation right right yeah you ever find yourself in that kind of situation very uncomfortable yeah what has happened all of a sudden sure all of a sudden what in the world is going on somewhere somehow you'll let me put it this way you will never get into a situation where God can't keep you and where you will be con uh in complete control yeah and you will be comfortable and able to rest as long as you stay within the boundary of his word yeah right when you start tempting it right I like going to baseball stadiums I go to professional I do but I know that that's not God's ground that's right I know W brother John you're admitting something right now I know that ball fields and those kind of places especially the higher up you go to Tennessee or whatever you are take I'm I I like to watch football I like to watch baseball nothing wrong with that in itself right and I don't plan on partaking in any of those situations right I don't go there and say well praise God I'm at the Ballpark give me a beard no I'm there to watch the game right right but I know when I step out of that or or into that there's a chance that some drunk idiot it's going to spill beer on my wife amen and you talk about being uncomfortable yeah it's getting tight but John you're you're you're admitting something I'm just telling you that's that's I know that going in right it's okay shame on me cuz I found that situations will often arise right if you're you're not careful yes sir sure you can do all the preventative stuff that you want right right I've taken my wife we went and watched a Cincinnati Reds game cuz I like baseball just to watch baseball there's people behind us they didn't spill beer on her but she was like what is that smell that's right they kicked the cup over underneath the seat nothing nothing came of it true but it just makes you more aware yeah that's right do I think it's wrong no do I think it's right no right it's one of those those places it's one of those things you probably won't have to hear me preach ever [Laughter] again that's good come on but I'm just right down where we live that's right I live like you live there's always when you go outside of God's boundaries now I don't I don't see in the in the message where brother brandom said do not go don't see it it's not there right he said you should be in church rather than one of those places right we we need to keep that in mind come on but that's where Naomi's husband found himself in an uncomfortable situation in a place at a time and he brought his whole family there yes and he rested in that h I don't think you should have season tickets to the Reds baseball games I'm not coning any of that but I don't see a problem with going every now and then to to watch a baseball game I try and find tickets away from everybody but Naomi's husband settled right in there he lived in Moab when he left in the morning with his lunch pail he stepped out into Moab and he went to his job and it was in the midst of Moab and he went as much as he wanted to sanctify his house guess where it was in Moab yes sir he died his son died his other son died and Naomi got a clue brothers and sisters God is constantly warning us keeping us watching us he loves us more than anything else and when we find ourselves in those situations in those things and he's telling us telling us you better wake up right you're going to lose your family well not if they're predestinated come on oh goodness you're right they'll be there if they're predestinated but I don't want my kids dragging in beat down wore out scars all over them that's right that's good because the choices that I made right good right right okay Lord but that's what we're facing what families are facing when we don't fully commit to what God's word says and like I said you go outside of those bounds in those gray areas you get in trouble get in trouble real quick how can you have rest you think Naomi and her husband and her boys when after they got back home saw those little children getting sacrificed how well do you think they rested they didn't neither would I right neither would you well brother John we don't have to worry about that not a physical right sacrifice but there are people in this world that would sell their their children for a little bit of crack yeah or a a little bit of alcohol true right they're committed to that right and they don't care about anything else that's the type of world we live in brothers and sisters if you don't know you know now yes sir people are crazy yes true let me find a place here Redemption by power it says if you'll notice while the children of Israel who had come out of darkness and accepted the light when they got in trouble the light turned back around and they slept all night they slept all night let me read it again if you'll notice while the children of Israel who had come out of darkness and accepted the light when they got in trouble the line the light turned back around and they slept all night and while they were sleeping God was sending a wind blowing down across the sea opening up a way of Escape Hallelujah to the lamb I'm so glad that I've been filled with the Holy Spirit tonight while we are sleeping rejoicing resting in the promises of God every man and woman tonight that will accept Jesus Christ on those grounds the Holy Spirit while you're asleep I don't know how much more resting you can get than asleep while you're asleep while you're resting in his promise maybe you're maybe you're blind maybe you can't hear maybe you can't see maybe you're sick heart trouble cancer or something dying except the light tonight and rest on it and the wind coming like a rushing Mighty Wind on the day of Pentecost will move down through there and open up a way for you Hallelujah that you'll pass right through through the valley of sickness right back into the land of Health again you'll pass right through the land of cold formal Shackled down indiff religion to a holy ghost filled happy rejoicing Heart full of joy while you are sleeping we need to get so Brothers come we need to get so comfortable where we are in God and who God is in our [Music] life we get to such a place where God your word said this I believe it and I'm resting right in it now I'm going to sleep yes and while I sleep while I rest you'll send that wind down through Thank You Lord and you will make a way for whatever situation you have GL whatever problem you have whatever illness you have God Will Make A Way that's while you're asleep right amen when you're asleep you ain't got no control over nothing yeah amen true don't be so busy we say we're committed to God and we're helping him out the whole time yeah yeah there's something wrong with that picture he wants us to be so rested and so assured that we can go right to sleep wow thank you that's beautiful and know that he's send in that that wind to open a way of Escape right amen right what an awesome God we serve yes sir how wonderful he is if we can truly just rest in him that's right if we can really rest stand with me let's pray Lord Jesus Lord I love you I thank you for your word Lord Lord Jesus never ceases to amaze me Lord how you can speak to me through my own lips Lord and Lord Jesus I pray that you would just forgive me for anything I said wrong or any
