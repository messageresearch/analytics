TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i'm just talking about the word says hey are we worried about what the world says are y'all tell me that you've lived this long and now we're gonna start pulling back on this and that and the other and we're scared of what the world says and the government says well i'm sorry i'm not i believe we're living in an hour when prophecy is coming to pass remember the prophet told us years and years ago and how his voice must have seemed so out of step was what can you imagine how that the people of that day must have heard brother branham say those things that women will be this and it's a women's world and women will do this and that and the other and they probably looked at him and said are you kidding are you out of your mind we women can't do this and we women can't do that they sure can't say it today and for the most part the women of this world do not want equal rights they want rights above men now you say what you want to say and so it with a lot of these other agendas they do not want equal rights they want above your rights now you can sit there and hold your peace if you want to but open your eyes and realize they're not wanting equal rights they're wanting rights where they will be able to shut us down if we oppose their rights that is not equal rights that is them having precedent rights and us shutting our mouths and holding our peace well you're looking at somebody tonight that's not going to hold his now you can be cowards if you wish to but i'm going to stand before my lord one day and when i stand before him i don't want him looking me in the face and say you yell a belly chicken now you might sit there and hide your car when you drive to church and say i'm hiding in the back parking lot and i'm parking where they can't see my license plate well i'll tell you one thing jesus is having a picture took of you doing that and it'll meet you at the day of judgment and you sat there and said well i ain't amen in them parts he also took your picture on that so if i was you if i was coming i'd say amen i let heaven know and i'd certainly that hell no i'm not afraid of the devil i don't believe in being foolish now friends but i believe it's going to come to a spot we're going to have to be identified with what we stand for i can tell you one thing when god put something on my heart to expose something about the devil i will fight all hell get into church i will fight all hell trying to time out time my time won't tie right my shirt won't button right my shoes won't do right this won't work that won't work that won't work my ipad won't work whether or not you know what i bring two identical pie pads to church every night when i go to france i take two when i go to germany i take two you say why do you take two a spur just in case the devil gets a hold of this in here that's exactly right why because he hates to be exposed shouldn't you wonder why when we come to the house of god we've got to fight hell you got to fight it to get here you've got to fight it to sit there and hear the word you've got to fight and setting up with that old mask on your face to keep from going to sleep you got to fight it trying to get your breath why would somebody would at least blow your mouth out if you can't say in there just breathe so i know you're listening why because he knows the word of god is fixing to expose him that night and it will set you free from that affliction in your body or sets you free from that besetting sin so he'll try to occupy your mind he'll try to make you hot in the service and make you cold in the service or make your foot itch or your back itch or your toenails are hurting come on somebody why because he don't want you to hear what god's word has got to be he cannot stand to be exposed but we're here to expose his eye tonight [Applause]
