[12:03] to turn things over to God to call on
[12:06] him frequently and to trust him to take
[12:09] care of it and to thank him constantly

[14:11] this morning uh brother Chris connley
[14:13] and sister Sharon many of you know them
[14:15] the couple that's been coming over from
[14:18] over in Hendersonville North Carolina V
[14:20] being a part of our assembly his father
[14:22] passed away suddenly I believe on
[14:24] Thursday or Friday and they're just uh
[14:28] just very very very shocked by this and
[14:30] they're asking that we would remember
[14:32] those folks in prayer as we pray today
[14:34] also Fred Jones a good friend of ours is
[14:37] going to be having surgery on Tuesday
[14:39] Morning asking that we would remember
[14:41] him in prayer so let's remember that
[14:43] sister Bonnie Potter s to please pray
[14:45] for my daughter Leah and her family
[14:47] urgent unspoken prayer requests the Lord
[14:49] knows all about also we wants to want us
[14:52] remember her son Davey he's asked for us
[14:55] to pray for his boss's son Jared
[14:58] Pritchard he has cancer so we want to
[15:00] remember that prayer request today as we
[15:02] pray all the unspoken prayer request I
[15:05] know there's many needs in our assembly
[15:07] but let's come all these things unto the
[15:09] Lord Brother Joel if you take us to the
[15:11] Lord in prayer this morning buddy B
[15:13] hearts and
[15:14] heads Heavenly Father what a friend we
[15:18] have in you and when we go through these
[15:21] things and we hear of these
[15:23] circumstances among others Lord we know
[15:26] that we have confidence in our friend
[15:29] and I love how the prophet places it
[15:31] Lord he makes it such that our
[15:33] relationship with you is even closer
[15:35] than friendship he says that God wants
[15:38] to come down and be buddies and so
[15:41] father we can share things with buddies
[15:43] not that we wouldn't necessarily with
[15:44] friends so much but Lord we bring these
[15:47] needs unto you and we just know that you
[15:50] will meet them Father according to your
[15:52] will and purpose and when we don't
[15:55] understand father when we have to
[15:56] scratch our heads when the doctor turns
[15:59] and walks the other way and says there's
[16:01] nothing more that can be done and even
[16:03] when it seems like even within ourselves
[16:06] there there's no more that we can pray
[16:08] and we don't even know how to pray at
[16:09] times Lord you come on the scene and you
[16:12] move and these are not just words that
[16:14] we speak these are not just fairy tales
[16:17] that we read about but we serve a true
[16:20] and the Living God and that same God you
[16:22] yourself came and began to dwell in this
[16:26] Humanity these old frangible Dusty
[16:30] devilish frames in which we live father
[16:32] you chose to live in these bodies and so
[16:36] father May the words that you've spoken
[16:39] Lord may we take them Upon Our Hearts
[16:40] and speak to these needs Lord if we know
[16:43] these individuals may we find an
[16:45] opportunity in place that we can go lay
[16:47] our hands upon them or speak a word to
[16:50] them Father that would bring
[16:51] encouragement and even healing bring
[16:53] Victory and bring deliverance and bring
[16:55] encouragement father this this is what
[16:57] we've called been called to do in this
[16:59] age not just to come to church and hear
[17:01] words father from a man that's preaching
[17:04] but Lord we're to take these words
[17:06] that's our identification and these
[17:08] things are real to us and so father may
[17:11] we be put on display and may we have
[17:14] these opportunities father we look for
[17:16] what you're going to do in this service
[17:17] today may all thoughts that are unlike
[17:21] you be moved out of the way may all
[17:22] purposes all plans Lord we don't even
[17:24] know if we'll walk out of the building
[17:26] today so while we're here we're going to
[17:28] glorify you we're going to extol you
[17:30] we're going to magnify your name on high
[17:33] father that's why we are here this place
[17:35] may you come and fill it father with
[17:38] your presence and may we be receptive
[17:40] when you come by and may it be like the
[17:42] the Saints as they were walking that day
[17:44] father May our hearts burn within us by
[17:47] the things that we'll hear today
[17:48] everything may it be anointed and
[17:50] submitted to you and it's in Jesus
[17:52] Christ's name we pray amen amen amen

[44:37] certainly welcome you to the house of
[44:38] God the visitors that are here with us
[44:40] we welcome you into our gates let's turn
[44:43] to the Book of Revelation if you would
[44:44] Today Chapter 1
[44:46] verse4 read a couple of places in the in
[44:50] the
[44:51] scripture I've been speaking about the
[44:53] bride's Bill of Rights and I I'd like to
[44:56] pick up again today by the help of the
[44:58] Lord on the right to a spiritual
[45:02] priesthood as the elect of God
[45:05] Revelation 1
[45:07] ver4 John to the seven churches which
[45:10] are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace
[45:15] from him which is and which was and
[45:19] which is to come and from the seven
[45:22] spirits which are before his throne and
[45:25] from Jesus Christ who is the faithful
[45:27] witness and the first begotten of the
[45:29] dead and the prince of the kings of the
[45:33] earth unto him that loved us and washed
[45:36] us from our
[45:38] sins I love this in his own
[45:42] blood and has made us Kings and Priests
[45:47] now remember we don't deserve it there's
[45:49] nothing we could do to ever gain it but
[45:51] he has made us this himself made us
[45:55] Kings and and priest unto our God and
[45:57] his father to him be glory and Dominion
[46:00] forever and ever amen Revelation 5 verse
[46:05] 9 as John picks up again about the
[46:09] priest and this is after the lamb now
[46:11] has opened the book after The Lamb opens
[46:14] the book tears the seals off then this
[46:17] is what takes place in heaven and they
[46:20] sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy
[46:23] to take the book to open the seals
[46:25] thereof for thou was slain and Hast
[46:27] redeemed us to God by thy blood out of
[46:31] every Kindred and tongue and people and
[46:37] nation and has made us unto our God
[46:41] Kings and Priests and we shall reign on
[46:45] the
[46:47] earth God hasten the day that'll happen
[46:50] how may like to be remembered today as
[46:52] we pray God bless you let's hold our
[46:53] request in our hearts before the Lord
[46:58] Lord Jesus we count it such a privilege
[47:00] that we could be gathered here
[47:02] today already sensed your presence and
[47:05] for that we're so thankful we realize
[47:08] Lord that as Mortals one day we're going
[47:10] to have to stand before you we're have
[47:13] to give an account for our
[47:15] life every day every hour every moment
[47:19] that we've
[47:20] lived help us I pray father that we will
[47:23] realize when we stand before for you
[47:26] that day many of the things now that
[47:29] take up so much of our time will be
[47:32] absolutely
[47:34] worthless we would have will wished so
[47:37] desperately we would have taken more
[47:39] time for the things that really matter
[47:43] for those that stand before the white
[47:44] Throne every thought every wrongdoing
[47:49] every evil will Flash before them by
[47:53] then there'll be no mercy
[47:56] so while there is Mercy now father we
[47:58] want to ask you forgive us forgive us of
[48:02] our failures forgive us of our
[48:05] shortcomings help us that we can be more
[48:07] in love with you than we've ever been in
[48:10] our entire
[48:11] lives help me today Jesus to get out of
[48:14] the way speak the word to our hearts we
[48:17] present our needs to you now father we
[48:19] commit the service to you in Jesus
[48:22] Christ's name amen God bless you you may
[48:26] be
[48:38] seated it was actually God who
[48:41] instituted the priesthood in the Old
[48:44] Testament to give his people a
[48:49] goet the priesthood would bring
[48:51] sacrifices from the people into God's
[48:55] presence because every Jew was not
[48:58] allowed to go directly into the presence
[49:01] of
[49:03] God God allowed them to build a
[49:06] tabernacle and then a
[49:09] temple God's presence came and
[49:12] Sanctified those two places and made
[49:15] their sacrifices and their offerings
[49:19] acceptable the people would stand on the
[49:22] outside while the priest was on the
[49:24] inside doing this
[49:26] work of reconciliation and Redemption
[49:28] for them but the priests themselves were
[49:31] not any more qualified than the people
[49:34] were unless they came through a process
[49:38] to make them fit to stand in the
[49:41] presence of God they were first called
[49:44] by God the tribe of Levi and then they
[49:48] were also
[49:50] anointed by Moses at the time and they
[49:54] were sanctified IED or set apart for a
[49:58] man to walk in there even though he was
[50:00] a levite without being anointed he would
[50:03] die without being set apart Sanctified
[50:08] he would die so when we come to the New
[50:12] Testament and then we look at What the
[50:14] Lord Has Done to start a church a
[50:18] bride a new kingdom a new order of a
[50:23] different type of priesthood a
[50:25] priesthood that will not offer Pascal
[50:28] Lambs or a bulock or an incense or
[50:32] trespass offering but we will offer
[50:37] ourselves we will offer the fruit of our
[50:39] lips we will raise our hands and offer
[50:43] that to God we will bring him so many
[50:47] things but none of them are for sin or
[50:50] for
[50:51] atonement but unless we also are
[50:55] anointed Ed and
[50:57] consecrated our offerings are not
[51:00] received so it's not like that we just
[51:02] bring it to God and God is so desperate
[51:04] that God will just take anything and
[51:06] everything that people give him no he
[51:08] won't either he will only take that
[51:11] which meets his strict requirement and
[51:15] that is it must come from priests that
[51:19] have been set apart and set aside and
[51:21] Sanctified but they also need to be
[51:24] anointed
[51:26] but how do they become anointed well he
[51:30] crushes the lily of the valley and the
[51:33] rose of
[51:34] Sharon and he releases the perfume out
[51:37] of the life of the only sinless one that
[51:40] ever lived on the earth after the fall
[51:43] he sends that back upon us and anoints
[51:45] our lives to where that what we do is
[51:50] mixed with the fragrance of the Pascal
[51:54] lamb even our prayers uh I know you
[51:58] Bible readers know this that our our
[52:01] prayers have to be mixed with
[52:05] incense in order for him to receive them
[52:09] it has been said that prayers are like
[52:12] little children going out into the
[52:15] flower garden or the wild flowers and
[52:19] they pick the yellow and they pick the
[52:21] red and the white and the pink and maybe
[52:23] the fuchsia but at the same time they'll
[52:26] pick some weeds because weeds also will
[52:30] flower their mother meets them at the
[52:32] door and whenever they bring these
[52:34] flowers to their mother and their mother
[52:37] being wiser than they are able to look
[52:39] and see but this is poison and this is
[52:42] not really acceptable and the mother
[52:45] sorts through the flowers as they bring
[52:49] them and she separates them you
[52:52] understand that our prayers Before the
[52:54] Throne of God many times when we pray we
[52:57] have selfishness we have arrogance we
[53:00] have pride we have an objective that
[53:03] isn't quite right before the Lord how is
[53:06] it that God accepts our prayers they are
[53:09] mixed with
[53:11] incense and the incense goes in with our
[53:16] prayers and blends the aroma to where
[53:19] the weeds of selfishness and self-pity
[53:24] and all of that we pray don't sit there
[53:26] and look at me and tell me you don't do
[53:27] that and how in the world can God then
[53:30] receive our prayers and our prayers be
[53:33] as if it was the Lord Jesus himself
[53:35] praying it's the incense that makes up
[53:39] for what we lack and our temporary
[53:42] understanding aren't you grateful for
[53:45] that watch's this in the Messiah the
[53:47] prophet said God called Messias God
[53:50] called us and we become Kings and
[53:53] Priests unto God like Jesus was God's
[53:56] high priest and we become a lesser
[54:00] priest Jesus was God in fullness dwelt
[54:03] in him to shine forth the expression of
[54:05] God to the world for God was in Christ
[54:08] reconciling the world to himself and as
[54:10] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[54:13] to himself God comes into his church and
[54:18] anoints him some Messiahs
[54:24] amen
[54:27] Messiahs oh my do you see it the same
[54:30] things he did in his church the same
[54:33] power he had in his church his church
[54:36] becomes his Dominion he is King over his
[54:42] dominion and we are Kings and Priests
[54:44] offering listen to this now spiritual
[54:47] sacrifices to God the fruit of our lips
[54:51] giving praise to his name oh my amen
[54:55] there you are
[54:56] Messiahs Messiahs little
[55:00] Messiahs little anointed ones anointed
[55:04] off of what the main one anointed off of
[55:10] the great one so if we're not Anointed
[55:14] God cannot hear our prayers if we're not
[55:17] Anointed God will not receive our
[55:20] worship we could say the name of Jesus
[55:22] and oh Lord I worship you I praise you I
[55:25] adore you I exalt your name but if we're
[55:27] not Anointed with the anointing of the
[55:31] day you see Jesus said in Mark chapter 7
[55:34] how be it in vain do they worship me
[55:38] teaching for Doctrine the Commandments
[55:42] of men so you can imagine millions of
[55:46] people have gathered today in churches
[55:48] all around the world and they've
[55:50] worshiped and they've sung and they
[55:53] believe with all of their heart they
[55:55] they have worshiped and praised God and
[55:57] God has received that worship but he has
[56:00] not unless they're preaching the right
[56:03] thing cuz you said Jesus said how be it
[56:06] in vain do they worship me teaching for
[56:08] Doctrine the Commandments of men so you
[56:10] mean our worship is either accepted or
[56:15] rejected based upon the doctrine that we
[56:19] believe and
[56:23] teach so when we teach for Doctrine the
[56:27] Commandments of men our worship is a
[56:31] complete waste of
[56:36] time you might as well be singing jingle
[56:38] bells jingle bells jingle all the
[56:43] way oh but we say the name of Jesus I
[56:47] don't care if you do say the name of
[56:48] Jesus it's only accepted when it's
[56:51] revealed it's accepted through the
[56:53] revealed word of the hour you see that
[56:56] is the name of God the word interpreted
[57:02] is the
[57:03] manifestation of the name of God for the
[57:07] word name in the Old Testament actually
[57:10] is shim which means
[57:13] reputation traits characteristics of the
[57:17] person you're identify amen so God then
[57:22] has him a church as he did 2,000 years
[57:26] ago he has one today and they are
[57:30] anointed to be able to not only carry
[57:33] out his work cast out Devils heal the
[57:36] sick do all the great things that he did
[57:38] but they're anointed to worship him to
[57:42] praise him they will worship Him in
[57:46] spirit and in truth read with me in
[57:50] Exodus
[57:51] 28:41 and thou shalt put upon the them
[57:55] upon Aaron thy brother and his sons with
[57:58] him now he talking about the Holy
[58:00] garments that only the priests could
[58:02] wear and thou shalt anoint them and
[58:06] consecrate them and sanctify them that
[58:10] they may Minister unto me in the
[58:13] priest's office now look what happens
[58:15] they are anointed they are consecrated
[58:19] and they are Sanctified so they couldn't
[58:22] just walk in with any type of clothes
[58:25] that they wanted they couldn't just pick
[58:27] out their favorite perfume that they
[58:30] wanted they had to be Anointed with a
[58:32] special concoction that was made by the
[58:37] Apothecary that had five different
[58:39] elements given by Divine proportions by
[58:43] which they were anointed in other words
[58:46] we'd say it like this in this day the
[58:49] fivefold ministry five aspects of the
[58:53] oil so much of Cal
[58:55] so much of this so much of myrr they
[58:57] couldn't pick even their own concoction
[58:59] it had to be exactly the way God
[59:01] described it a fifth of this two fifths
[59:04] of that one tenth of that a fifth of
[59:07] this put it all together and then mix
[59:09] all that together and it produced this
[59:12] phenomenal type of aroma so you had no
[59:15] no question about knowing when a man was
[59:18] a priest because when he come out from
[59:21] the presence of God even without his
[59:23] miter and the heod and all that on him
[59:26] he had a smell about him that you knew
[59:29] he'd been in the presence of God you see
[59:32] we don't want to just have enough
[59:34] religion that makes us feel good when
[59:35] we're here on Sunday morning we want to
[59:38] be able to walk out these doors and have
[59:40] the smell of Jesus Christ on our lives
[59:44] that people will know there's something
[59:46] different about them people if we don't
[59:48] have that we're not a
[59:51] success notice now in Leviticus 8 verse
[59:55] 10 and Moses took the anointing oil and
[59:59] Anointed The Tabernacle and all that was
[1:00:02] therein and
[1:00:04] Sanctified
[1:00:06] them how can wood and gold now remember
[1:00:10] a lot of the wood was chatim wood there
[1:00:13] was gold which represented deity silver
[1:00:15] which represented silver blue which
[1:00:18] represented the Heavenly there was a
[1:00:20] color from the mollusk there was all
[1:00:22] these different colors that were Blended
[1:00:24] together so it was elements of the Earth
[1:00:27] the metallurgical value the gold the
[1:00:29] silver the brass and all that the copper
[1:00:31] come from the Earth part of it come from
[1:00:33] the sea part of it come from trees part
[1:00:36] of it come from insects what was God
[1:00:38] doing pulling from botony Life pulling
[1:00:42] from all these Elements of Life to give
[1:00:44] a place to worship him so how could a
[1:00:48] little a silicus which was a little tiny
[1:00:51] bug that lived on the oak tree very very
[1:00:54] rare and they would catch this only the
[1:00:56] female could do this and they would take
[1:00:58] the body of the female and they would
[1:01:01] squeeze this out of her body and it
[1:01:04] would produce one drop of this dye this
[1:01:09] dye then in turn was used to be able to
[1:01:11] dye part of the garments and part of the
[1:01:13] color of the Tabernacle so God would
[1:01:16] allow them to take an insect there was a
[1:01:19] mollusk which came from the
[1:01:21] Mediterranean and they would take it and
[1:01:24] grind the shell and be able to mix
[1:01:27] another color so what's God doing
[1:01:29] pulling from botney Life pulling from
[1:01:32] Oceanic life pulling from human life
[1:01:35] taking the badger which is a very rotten
[1:01:37] mean animal and God pulling from all
[1:01:40] these different Avenues and bring it all
[1:01:43] together and you've still got all this
[1:01:44] element that is not holy how's a holy
[1:01:48] God ever going to get in that place cuz
[1:01:51] he had to Sanctified amen with with what
[1:01:55] with what part with blood part with oil
[1:02:00] and the rest
[1:02:02] Spirit there's two types of
[1:02:06] sanctification deity type and human type
[1:02:11] now watch in Leviticus 8:10 and Moses
[1:02:13] took the anointing oil and Anointed The
[1:02:16] Tabernacle and all that was there in and
[1:02:19] Sanctified them and he sprinkled thereof
[1:02:22] upon the altar notice how many times
[1:02:26] seven times and Anointed The Altar and
[1:02:31] his vessels notice now the gender that
[1:02:34] he gives to the Tabernacle it was a
[1:02:37] hymn his vessels both the labor and and
[1:02:42] the labor also identified his foot to
[1:02:48] sanctify them so what are they doing
[1:02:51] consecrating sanctifying how can you
[1:02:54] take take gold and make it holy for God
[1:02:57] there's a process now how are we then
[1:03:01] ever going to be able to present our
[1:03:03] bodies since our bodies are unregenerate
[1:03:07] now no matter how much Holy Ghost you've
[1:03:08] got in your soul your body is still
[1:03:11] according to what the prophet taught us
[1:03:12] whenever you see a man priest potent a
[1:03:15] prophet he said he's born between Satan
[1:03:19] and
[1:03:19] Eve Satan and Eve so our bodies are
[1:03:23] hybrid is that right yet Paul tells us
[1:03:25] in Romans 12:1 I beseech you therefore
[1:03:28] Brethren by the mercies of God that you
[1:03:30] would present your bodies a Living
[1:03:32] Sacrifice holy and acceptable before the
[1:03:36] Lord which is only your reasonable
[1:03:38] service how can my flesh ever be
[1:03:42] considered to be
[1:03:43] holy how could your flesh brother Joel
[1:03:46] ever consider to be holy that God
[1:03:50] himself would look at it cuz my body
[1:03:52] don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:03:54] my soul does my soul has been redeemed
[1:03:58] but how can my flesh when Paul goes on
[1:04:00] to say that we would lift up holy hands
[1:04:04] but
[1:04:06] how how can I ever reach a state of Hol
[1:04:11] and sanctification in my body that my
[1:04:15] body will be
[1:04:16] holy to
[1:04:19] God I've got the answer in front of me
[1:04:21] you want to know
[1:04:23] it might take me a little while to get
[1:04:25] to
[1:04:26] it notice again in Leviticus 8:12 and he
[1:04:31] poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's
[1:04:34] head and anointed
[1:04:37] him to sanctify
[1:04:41] him so he's pouring this anointing on
[1:04:44] now remember specific oil specific
[1:04:48] elements specific measurement word word
[1:04:52] word commandment commandment command
[1:04:54] commandment obedience obedience
[1:04:57] obedience and then when the obedience is
[1:04:59] rendered it produces a product which can
[1:05:03] actually take a mortal man and he walk
[1:05:06] in there and become Anointed with this
[1:05:08] oil and it transforms him into a holy
[1:05:15] priest amen amen glory to
[1:05:18] God than I told you the other morning
[1:05:22] the Lord I got up out of bed and I was
[1:05:25] fixing to start the day and the Lord
[1:05:26] spoke to me and gave me something this
[1:05:29] is
[1:05:30] it so you see there's a
[1:05:33] sanctification that the Lord does and
[1:05:36] then there's actually
[1:05:38] one that we
[1:05:40] do now it takes both actually to make us
[1:05:45] acceptable and the one that God does we
[1:05:48] can't and the one we're supposed to he
[1:05:53] won't
[1:05:57] the one that he's supposed to do we
[1:05:58] cannot do and the one we're supposed to
[1:06:02] do he will not
[1:06:04] do you read with me in Exodus
[1:06:07] 29:42 this shall be a continual burnt
[1:06:11] offering throughout your Generations at
[1:06:13] the door of the Tabernacle of the
[1:06:15] congregation before the Lord where I
[1:06:17] will meet you to speak there unto thee
[1:06:21] and there I will meet with the children
[1:06:24] of Israel and the
[1:06:27] Tabernacle shall be
[1:06:30] Sanctified by my glory amen now watch it
[1:06:35] was Moses that anointed the priest and
[1:06:38] they were Sanctified by an order of
[1:06:41] obedience to the Commandments of God but
[1:06:44] it was them that Sanctified them but
[1:06:46] what's going to sanctify now the
[1:06:48] building and the Tabernacle it's
[1:06:50] actually going to be Sanctified by the
[1:06:53] shakan
[1:06:54] glory of God so you mean then God could
[1:06:58] come in a building say like this this
[1:07:01] sheet rock come from the same place that
[1:07:03] other buildings were made out of so it
[1:07:05] could be a honky tonk or a bar or a you
[1:07:08] know a school building or whatever so
[1:07:10] this this sheetrock didn't come from
[1:07:12] some Holy Ghost fil place where all holy
[1:07:15] ghost fil people made it and all holy
[1:07:18] ghost fill people worked on this
[1:07:19] building there's some that did and these
[1:07:22] panels here they come from a place where
[1:07:25] uh they manufacture panels for
[1:07:27] auditoriums and all types of things and
[1:07:29] this carpet was made in the same place
[1:07:32] these W these trees this all these
[1:07:34] different things it's here so what we
[1:07:36] say this is a holy Place well what makes
[1:07:39] it
[1:07:39] holy it's not the stone the piano made
[1:07:43] by Yamaha that that one there we didn't
[1:07:45] order a particular holy Yamaha piano and
[1:07:49] a particular Fender holy guitar and a
[1:07:52] particular holy apartment for Rolland
[1:07:55] only makes holy drums for Holy
[1:08:00] Rollers that set of drums could wound up
[1:08:02] playing rock and roll music same with
[1:08:04] that piano but we say but this is a holy
[1:08:07] place so what makes it
[1:08:11] holy His
[1:08:19] Glory
[1:08:21] Hallelujah and the Tabernacle shall be
[1:08:25] Sanctified by my glory look at the word
[1:08:28] Sanctified to consecrate prepare
[1:08:31] dedicate be Hallowed be holy be separate
[1:08:34] to be set apart be
[1:08:38] treated as
[1:08:41] sacred so how many of you would bring
[1:08:43] your biscuits and gravy and your sausage
[1:08:46] and your bacon and your cup of coffee
[1:08:48] and your hot chocolate and your donuts
[1:08:50] and all that in here to church with you
[1:08:52] this morning and set there and eat
[1:08:54] it
[1:08:57] anybody well you have no problem doing
[1:08:59] that at home right you could sit outside
[1:09:01] in your car and do that you you'd be
[1:09:03] okay with
[1:09:04] that and then you go walk right out of
[1:09:07] these doors go through the hallway that
[1:09:08] come out on the other side into the
[1:09:10] fellowship hall and we sat right there
[1:09:12] yesterday we ate food we talked we drank
[1:09:16] we had Fellowship
[1:09:18] why that is built for a separate purpose
[1:09:23] this is hallowed for the preaching of
[1:09:26] the word for the sick being healed for
[1:09:29] the Lost being saved praise the lord
[1:09:33] it's the way we
[1:09:35] consecrated the building it's the way we
[1:09:39] dedicated it and the purpose we
[1:09:42] consecrated it for for us to just come a
[1:09:45] a a little distance and bring that same
[1:09:48] food out of that building and to bring
[1:09:51] it in here why we would feel terrible we
[1:09:54] would feel awful in doing so why because
[1:09:57] of the way we built it of the way we
[1:10:00] consecrated it and the purpose of is
[1:10:03] don't you understand your flesh is no
[1:10:05] different than your brothers your
[1:10:07] sisters your mam your daddies that don't
[1:10:09] even believe this word but yours is
[1:10:13] consecrated for a special service to
[1:10:16] almighty God hallelujah you come from
[1:10:19] the same lump of humanity that your
[1:10:22] father and your mother and your siblings
[1:10:25] and your aunts and uncles but you
[1:10:27] brought your body to the house of God to
[1:10:30] dedicate it to the service of
[1:10:34] Adonai amen now notice what God said
[1:10:37] that he would do Exodus
[1:10:40] 2944 and
[1:10:41] I will sanctify the Tabernacle of the
[1:10:45] congregation and the altar
[1:10:47] I will sanctify also both Aaron and his
[1:10:51] sons now Moses and God
[1:10:55] both must perform an act of
[1:10:59] sanctification on the
[1:11:03] priesthood God will do his part but he
[1:11:06] wasn't going to do Moses
[1:11:08] part so Moses had to anoint them
[1:11:12] actually Moses
[1:11:15] based the
[1:11:18] priests before Moses would dress them he
[1:11:22] bathed them
[1:11:25] can you imagine how humiliating for them
[1:11:27] priests they said Moses we've been
[1:11:30] taking bath since we were little
[1:11:32] guys but they needed to be bathed under
[1:11:35] the
[1:11:36] administration of the
[1:11:39] Prophet that's why some of the message
[1:11:41] preachers stink real bad they refuse to
[1:11:45] be Washed by the Water of Malachi
[1:11:49] 4 and when a message preacher gets to
[1:11:51] the spot he thinks he don't need the
[1:11:53] message message no more you watch him
[1:11:55] start preaching stinky
[1:11:57] doctrines you watch him turn into a
[1:12:00] stinky preacher and have a stinky Church
[1:12:02] come on somebody I don't know about
[1:12:05] every other man of God here in this
[1:12:06] place today I still need to be washed by
[1:12:09] the purity of the teachings of Malachi 4
[1:12:13] I hope I never get so big in my own mind
[1:12:16] that I think I don't need it I've lost
[1:12:18] my mind when I do so Moses then would
[1:12:22] bathe him brother Joel then Moses would
[1:12:24] close them and put the garments on them
[1:12:27] again how humiliating that they they
[1:12:30] themselves had bathed himself and dress
[1:12:32] himself for years and years but this was
[1:12:35] God's instruction God was making the
[1:12:39] priesthood and in one sense of the word
[1:12:42] bow to humility to the higher office
[1:12:45] above them I know some of our preachers
[1:12:48] are ashamed to quote the prophet anymore
[1:12:50] but you're looking this morning at one
[1:12:52] that is not ashamed of the message of
[1:12:54] Malachi 4 I'm not ashamed to tell you
[1:12:57] where I get it from I'm not ashamed to
[1:13:00] tell you I am anointed with the
[1:13:03] anointing of the last day years ago I
[1:13:07] was a Pentecostal preacher and that's
[1:13:08] the anointing I had on me but I've got a
[1:13:11] different anointing on me now it's a
[1:13:14] Rapture anointing it's an Elijah
[1:13:17] anointing it's a translation anointing
[1:13:20] it's a Rapture Revelation oh Hal
[1:13:23] Hallelujah Revelation 10 anointing
[1:13:26] anybody here with me
[1:13:28] today now notice God says I will
[1:13:31] sanctify the Tabernacle of the
[1:13:33] congregation and the altar I will
[1:13:36] sanctify both Aaron and his sons to
[1:13:39] minister to me in the priest's office
[1:13:42] the garments they could have them on
[1:13:44] that was not enough they could have the
[1:13:46] oil on that was not enough don't you
[1:13:49] understand what one of the things that
[1:13:50] separates the bride from the church that
[1:13:52] the church can have anointing of
[1:13:55] blessings oh the Lord blesses us and
[1:13:57] we've got this and we've got that and
[1:13:59] we're growing and we're doing this that
[1:14:01] and other sure that comes from just
[1:14:02] having part of the blessings of the Lord
[1:14:05] but we don't want just blessings we want
[1:14:07] life I don't want just the gifts I want
[1:14:11] the giver my focus give me the giver and
[1:14:14] I get every gift he's got come on
[1:14:17] somebody give me the giver I get
[1:14:19] everything I have need of Hallelujah
[1:14:22] notice now number again chter 8:1 17 for
[1:14:26] all the firstborn of the children of
[1:14:28] Israel are mine both man and beast on
[1:14:30] the day that I smote every firstborn in
[1:14:33] the land of Egypt I Sanctified them for
[1:14:39] myself now watch what God did while
[1:14:41] death is striking all the land of Egypt
[1:14:45] God is performing a work of
[1:14:49] sanctification and the firstborn are
[1:14:52] being sanctified ified by the smearing
[1:14:55] of the blood over the door the token of
[1:14:57] course and then going through the
[1:14:59] rituals of eating the lamb and the
[1:15:01] bitter herbs so while people are dying
[1:15:05] people are being Sanctified while people
[1:15:08] are being killed the firstborn of all
[1:15:10] the land of Egypt but God said now this
[1:15:13] is what I'm going to do from this day
[1:15:15] forward the firstborn of all of Israel
[1:15:19] belong to me and I sanctify them to
[1:15:23] myself so then you could either take
[1:15:25] your son to the Tabernacle and give him
[1:15:28] a service to the Lord or you could
[1:15:31] redeem your son that also transferred
[1:15:34] over uh to your animals and you could
[1:15:37] redeem them animals or you could bring
[1:15:39] them to the priesthood so God had a set
[1:15:42] value on a donkey you remember the
[1:15:45] prophet talking about that little donkey
[1:15:46] and she give birth uh to a little old
[1:15:49] ugly thing and that little old thing
[1:15:50] come out of there standing there
[1:15:52] bowlegged standing there and his ears
[1:15:54] all flopped down but he said that Mama
[1:15:57] was really taught in the word and she
[1:15:59] would look at that little donkey of hers
[1:16:01] and say son you are my firstborn oh but
[1:16:05] mama my legs are bowlegged and my my
[1:16:07] ears is all hang down don't worry the
[1:16:10] priests will never see you because there
[1:16:13] will be a lamb offered for you
[1:16:16] Hallelujah God redeemed them all under
[1:16:20] one spoken word of sanctification now
[1:16:23] remember just by God speaking this it
[1:16:27] brought it to pass over the entirety of
[1:16:30] all the firstborn that was alive and all
[1:16:34] of those thereafter by the spoken word
[1:16:37] of
[1:16:38] God praise the Lord Jesus notice then
[1:16:42] God said what he done I Sanctified them
[1:16:45] for myself Jeremiah 1:5 before I form
[1:16:50] thee in the belly I knew thee before
[1:16:53] thou camest forth out of the womb I
[1:16:57] Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a
[1:17:01] prophet unto the nation you mean before
[1:17:04] Jeremiah even got to exercise his free
[1:17:07] moral
[1:17:09] agency well some of you Baptists that
[1:17:11] have a hard time with that wouldn't you
[1:17:14] God chose Jeremiah before Jeremiah could
[1:17:17] even know anything about a choice well
[1:17:19] hang tight he done the bride the same
[1:17:22] way
[1:17:23] so God Sanctified Sanctified now I know
[1:17:27] you're going through your mind right now
[1:17:28] you're thinking sanctification
[1:17:30] sanctification you're thinking about the
[1:17:32] modern term of the way that we look at
[1:17:34] it and you're thinking about people
[1:17:35] getting rid of cigarettes and people
[1:17:37] getting rid of rock and roll music and
[1:17:38] people cleaning their closet out no no
[1:17:40] no no that that's what Come Along on
[1:17:43] down in time but this is the original
[1:17:46] application of sanctification in the Old
[1:17:48] Testament that it was something that was
[1:17:50] hallowed or set apart for the the
[1:17:53] service of God now remember that God
[1:17:56] himself is the only one that can
[1:17:58] sanctify people well enough for the
[1:18:01] Divine approach remember to approach him
[1:18:05] we must be accepted and we cannot
[1:18:08] sanctify ourselves in this sense to a
[1:18:11] clear enough stage before God that we
[1:18:13] could walk in there the way we want to
[1:18:16] well God hey I'm Donny rean I just come
[1:18:18] to talk to you today I want you to know
[1:18:19] I want to pray to you a little while no
[1:18:21] man can come to mees Jesus said except
[1:18:24] my father draws him first is that your
[1:18:28] Bible now watch in St John
[1:18:30] 177 Jesus praying sanctify them through
[1:18:35] thy truth Thy word is truth sanctify
[1:18:41] them set them apart consecrate them
[1:18:45] Father as thou H has sent me into the
[1:18:47] world even so have I sent them into the
[1:18:49] world and for their sakes I
[1:18:54] sanctify
[1:18:57] myself now does that mean Jesus was
[1:18:59] sneaking around
[1:19:01] smoking was Jesus sneaking around
[1:19:03] drinking a little wine on the side and
[1:19:05] Jesus was sneaking around doing some
[1:19:07] things that was wrong no but Jesus was a
[1:19:12] man and Jesus as a man could have had a
[1:19:16] wife I'm going to stagger some of you no
[1:19:19] doubt Jesus as a man could have
[1:19:22] physically
[1:19:23] fathered
[1:19:28] children but it does not mean those
[1:19:30] offspring would have been literally Sons
[1:19:33] and Daughters of
[1:19:36] God but he knew it would stumble some of
[1:19:42] you if Jesus would have got married and
[1:19:45] had a wife and had relations with a wife
[1:19:48] and had a family and all of that some of
[1:19:51] his people it would have stumbled them
[1:19:54] they' never been able to understood
[1:19:58] it so he said I set myself apart if he
[1:20:03] hadn't already done it
[1:20:07] enough Oh Praise You Lord
[1:20:11] Jesus and for their sakes notice now
[1:20:14] he's praying and he does not say father
[1:20:17] for your sake I won't do this or I won't
[1:20:20] do that but I
[1:20:24] won't for their sakes
[1:20:27] amen I'll tell you what friends you
[1:20:29] watch how people relate relate rather to
[1:20:32] other people and see how they use their
[1:20:35] cloak of Liberty in things and their
[1:20:39] attitude toward offending others and
[1:20:42] you'll be get a pretty good idea if they
[1:20:44] have eternal life or
[1:20:46] not how much say jump and scream and
[1:20:48] shout that don't really that don't
[1:20:50] really cut it and for their sakes I
[1:20:53] sanctify myself that they also might be
[1:20:56] Sanctified through the truth so here
[1:20:59] there is an element of sanctification
[1:21:02] that must come from the
[1:21:05] ministry in order to greatly affect the
[1:21:09] ministered
[1:21:10] to watch in Ephesians 5: 25 Paul's
[1:21:15] speaking husbands love your wives him as
[1:21:17] Christ also loved the church and gave
[1:21:19] himself for it that he might sanctify
[1:21:22] and cleanse it with the washing of the
[1:21:25] Water by the word this is hegeso which
[1:21:28] is a little different word than what we
[1:21:29] just read a while ago it means to be
[1:21:31] hallow be holy separate from profane
[1:21:35] things dedicate to God to consecrate now
[1:21:39] this type of
[1:21:40] sanctification we cannot do
[1:21:43] ourself he has to do it amen he has to
[1:21:47] do it we could never separate ourselves
[1:21:50] from that sinful nature we were born
[1:21:53] with only God can kill that
[1:21:58] nature Hebrews chapter 13 verse 12
[1:22:02] wherefore Jesus also that he might
[1:22:04] sanctify the people with his own blood
[1:22:07] suffered with out the gate so he goes
[1:22:10] beyond the gate as it was the day that
[1:22:13] they released the goat when the sins
[1:22:15] were transferred upon the head of the
[1:22:17] goat and he went out into the Wilderness
[1:22:20] so the Lord Jesus suffered without the
[1:22:22] gate outside of Jerusalem so whether you
[1:22:24] believe in Gordon's calvary or the
[1:22:26] original one both of them are outside
[1:22:28] the wall so it doesn't really matter so
[1:22:30] he went outside the gate in order to
[1:22:33] suffer for the people a reject for the
[1:22:37] rejected notice now man also though has
[1:22:41] a part in sanctification Exodus
[1:22:45] 29:37 7 days shall thou make an
[1:22:47] atonement for the Altar and Sanctified
[1:22:51] and it shall be an altar Most
[1:22:54] Holy
[1:22:56] whatsoever
[1:22:58] touches the
[1:23:01] altar shall be
[1:23:04] holy so when Moses done his part and he
[1:23:07] went through this this ritual of seven
[1:23:10] days to sanctify the altar then whenever
[1:23:13] they would bring a lamb just a regular
[1:23:15] lamb out on the field a bulock a ram
[1:23:18] whatever it was and they would place
[1:23:20] that sacrifice on this holy altar oh
[1:23:24] instead of this natural sacrifice
[1:23:27] transforming The Altar and making the
[1:23:29] altar
[1:23:31] unclean it had the exact opposite effect
[1:23:35] so you take this regular bulock this
[1:23:38] regular lamb this regular turtle dove
[1:23:40] this pigeon whatever it was and you lay
[1:23:43] it on the Altar and by simply touching
[1:23:47] the
[1:23:49] altar God looked at that and said I
[1:23:53] accept that
[1:23:55] Holy Lamb
[1:23:58] amen
[1:24:00] amen thank you
[1:24:02] Lord praise be to
[1:24:05] God 1 Chronicles
[1:24:07] 15:14 so the priest and the
[1:24:11] Levites Sanctified
[1:24:16] themselves so you mean God wouldn't do
[1:24:18] this no you see when people come to the
[1:24:22] Lord
[1:24:23] God will take many things from them
[1:24:25] there's people sitting right here today
[1:24:27] that I know by personal testimony that
[1:24:29] God took marijuana from them God took
[1:24:31] cigarettes from them God took drinking
[1:24:33] from them God took pills from them God
[1:24:36] took all types of
[1:24:38] things and there's other things they
[1:24:40] have battled and struggled and fought
[1:24:42] with to sanctify themselves through why
[1:24:46] God wants both efforts of sanctification
[1:24:49] to be manifested in us as his children
[1:24:52] children we're already lazy enough us
[1:24:55] bunch of sorry no good no count for
[1:24:58] nothing Leo to sins we're rotten we're
[1:25:00] spoiled we no good come on somebody say
[1:25:02] at least ouch if you can't say amen and
[1:25:05] if God done the whole thing would' be
[1:25:07] worse than what we are so God will do
[1:25:09] what we cannot do and then God says now
[1:25:12] I want you to sanctify
[1:25:16] yourself so the priests and the Levites
[1:25:19] Sanctified themselves to bring up the
[1:25:22] Ark of the Lord God of Israel 2
[1:25:25] Chronicles
[1:25:26] 29:15 and they gathered them their
[1:25:29] Brethren and Sanctified themselves and
[1:25:31] came according to the Commandment of the
[1:25:34] King by the words of the Lord to cleanse
[1:25:37] the house of the Lord now notice it's
[1:25:39] them so they're sanctifying they're
[1:25:42] laying aside habits they're laying aside
[1:25:45] things that they know is not right you
[1:25:47] know the way we do it today for many of
[1:25:49] us we're waiting on God to take him away
[1:25:52] from us and God is waiting on us to lay
[1:25:55] them
[1:25:56] down I wonder how many years some of you
[1:25:58] all have lost waiting on God to do
[1:26:02] something for you that he will never
[1:26:06] ever
[1:26:09] do sir praise the Lord y'all still with
[1:26:13] Me 2 Chronicles Chronicles 2934 but the
[1:26:17] priests were too few now this is the
[1:26:20] rededication of course so they could not
[1:26:23] Flay all the burnt offerings now here's
[1:26:26] all this levitical order and God would
[1:26:29] always keep the even the natural
[1:26:32] reproduction of the Levites to where it
[1:26:34] would be able to compensate with the
[1:26:36] growth of the tribes of Israel think of
[1:26:39] that even naturally you've got all these
[1:26:41] other 11 tribes that's living out here
[1:26:43] and as they grow and multiply and
[1:26:45] multiply if God don't let the priesthood
[1:26:47] multiply and be able to provide for
[1:26:50] himself there'll never be enough to be
[1:26:51] able to take care of all the needs now
[1:26:54] here it wasn't that there wasn't enough
[1:26:55] a number that there wasn't enough
[1:26:58] preachers as we'd say that were in a
[1:27:01] Sanctified state to where they could
[1:27:04] take care of the needs of the
[1:27:07] people so people were bringing offerings
[1:27:10] and bringing offerings and they were
[1:27:12] just piling up they were just piling up
[1:27:15] because there were not enough
[1:27:16] consecrated priest to be able to fle
[1:27:20] which means to take the meat off the
[1:27:21] bone and bring it as the acceptable
[1:27:24] approach into God's
[1:27:28] presence notice and they could not Flay
[1:27:31] all the burnt offerings wherefore their
[1:27:32] Brethren the Levites did help them till
[1:27:35] the work was ended until the other
[1:27:38] priests had Sanctified themselves for
[1:27:42] the Levites were more upright in their
[1:27:46] heart to sanctify
[1:27:49] themselves than the priest oh brother
[1:27:53] so now remember the
[1:27:55] Levites it was a whole tribe of Levi
[1:27:58] Levi but part of them carried the tent
[1:28:01] part of them washed the pots part of
[1:28:03] them supplied the oil they were not
[1:28:05] called to go in as priests so here was
[1:28:08] the called out of the called out the
[1:28:11] priesthood was called out of the
[1:28:13] levitical tribe as the bride is called
[1:28:17] out of the
[1:28:19] church so the some of the priests
[1:28:22] had got so cold and so indifferent on
[1:28:26] the Commandment of God and the Levites
[1:28:29] had more of a desire to be
[1:28:33] holy how sad amen I said how
[1:28:40] sad oh my 2 Chronicles
[1:28:43] 31:18 and to the genealogy of all their
[1:28:46] little ones their wives and their sons
[1:28:47] and their daughters to all the
[1:28:49] congregation for in their set off office
[1:28:52] they Sanctified themselves in Holiness
[1:28:57] am so in their set office they
[1:29:01] Sanctified themselves in Holiness now
[1:29:03] this is not just of course now speaking
[1:29:05] to the preachers alone every one of you
[1:29:08] whether you're a singer whether you're a
[1:29:10] musician whether you're just a member of
[1:29:12] the Ley you have a position in the body
[1:29:15] of Christ and nobody can take your place
[1:29:19] but brother Donnie I'm just a lay member
[1:29:21] what what what can I do you are to
[1:29:23] sanctify yourself in your position as
[1:29:26] Ley you're to pray for those that are
[1:29:30] the leaders you're to pray and petition
[1:29:32] as priests and pray for the leadership
[1:29:35] of God in the ministry not only in our
[1:29:37] church but around the world that God
[1:29:40] will get every predestinated seed so we
[1:29:42] can leave this mess that we're in y'all
[1:29:46] want to go home I'm tired of this world
[1:29:48] I'm sick and tired of the sin and the
[1:29:50] debauchery of evil that we're living in
[1:29:53] and putting up with every day let's get
[1:29:55] out of here children but we cannot do it
[1:29:58] until everyone whose name is on the Book
[1:30:00] of Life is called chosen Sanctified
[1:30:04] filled with the Holy Ghost and in their
[1:30:10] position watch Paul carry over this in
[1:30:13] the New Testament 2 Timothy chapter 2:
[1:30:16] 20 but in a great house there are not
[1:30:20] only vessels of gold and of silver but
[1:30:23] also of wood and of Earth and you see
[1:30:27] this also of course in the Tabernacle
[1:30:29] there were vessels of gold vessels of
[1:30:31] silver vessels of wood and vessels which
[1:30:34] were actually clay Earth
[1:30:38] pottery notice how he Likens this he
[1:30:41] said and some to honor and some to
[1:30:45] dishonor if a man therefore
[1:30:49] Purge himself
[1:30:54] from these he shall be a vessel unto
[1:30:58] honor
[1:31:00] Sanctified and meet for the Master's
[1:31:05] use you mean that Paul lays a lot of
[1:31:08] this
[1:31:10] responsibility on us as individuals yes
[1:31:13] sir that if a man looks at and it said
[1:31:16] if I'm no more than a lady or a woman
[1:31:19] I'm going to be the best
[1:31:22] that I can be for the kingdom of God I'm
[1:31:25] going to pray I'm going to read my Bible
[1:31:28] if they need anything done around the
[1:31:29] church I'm going to do what I can do I'm
[1:31:31] going to pray for the ministry I'm going
[1:31:33] to take the Sunday School teachers on my
[1:31:35] heart I'm going to take the leaders of
[1:31:37] the church on my heart that God will
[1:31:39] help them and lead them I'm going to
[1:31:42] pray for brother Donnie the way I ain't
[1:31:43] never prayed for him in my life because
[1:31:45] brother Donnie needs prayer Amen brother
[1:31:48] Donnie can tell you that I need prayer
[1:31:50] yes why I'm trying to to lead you out of
[1:31:53] this world into a body change look
[1:31:56] friends the men of God in this age are
[1:31:58] trying to preach their sheep to a level
[1:32:02] that no other age has ever done Paul
[1:32:05] never had to preach his people into a
[1:32:08] level of a body change Luther never had
[1:32:10] to preach his people to a level of a
[1:32:12] body change don't you understand the men
[1:32:15] of God in this hour are going to
[1:32:17] accomplish something that has never been
[1:32:19] done on the face of the Earth they will
[1:32:23] preach the living bride into a state of
[1:32:26] a body chain that death will give way
[1:32:30] hallelujah oh do we need to be
[1:32:33] Sanctified do we need to present ourself
[1:32:36] in the presence of God that he can use
[1:32:38] us not just me
[1:32:45] you I find this statement in 1 Peter
[1:32:49] 3:15 very unusual
[1:32:52] and Peter says but
[1:32:55] sanctify the Lord
[1:32:59] God in your
[1:33:03] hearts
[1:33:04] sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and
[1:33:07] be ready always to give an answer to
[1:33:11] every man that askthe of the reason of
[1:33:13] the hope that is within you with
[1:33:17] meekness and
[1:33:19] fear so you s ify the Lord God in your
[1:33:22] hearts and you're just thinking he's
[1:33:24] going to say well you go to church and
[1:33:25] you know you get down on your knees no
[1:33:27] actually you sanctify the Lord God in
[1:33:29] your hearts and then you share with
[1:33:31] others the reason of the hope that's on
[1:33:34] the inside of
[1:33:36] you
[1:33:39] on
[1:33:40] oh and then some of you all are
[1:33:42] wondering what can I do what can I do
[1:33:46] you've got so much to do my goodness
[1:33:48] we'll never get it done will we watch
[1:33:50] this if was ever a call to the church to
[1:33:54] sanctify ourselves and get away from the
[1:33:57] things of the world we're ready to cross
[1:34:00] over my goodness friends if you say this
[1:34:01] 1955 what about now are you ready
[1:34:04] tonight to throw aside and sanctify
[1:34:08] yourself from all your
[1:34:11] unbelief
[1:34:13] anybody Now watch how this
[1:34:16] sanctification for self will come into
[1:34:21] Ed Ying the body I love the way brother
[1:34:24] Ram deals with this in the adoption
[1:34:25] series I was talking to a little
[1:34:27] preacher yesterday going to preach for
[1:34:28] him and if you Nots up here on the
[1:34:30] highway and I asked him about a certain
[1:34:33] thing and he said yes brother Brenham
[1:34:35] but the most of my people doesn't
[1:34:38] believe in that I said most of them are
[1:34:42] legalist and he said yes
[1:34:45] brother doesn't believe that but he said
[1:34:49] for their sake
[1:34:52] you see this puts a pastor in a very odd
[1:34:55] and unusual State sometimes amen so here
[1:34:59] this man brother BR was going up to
[1:35:01] preach for him and of course the
[1:35:02] doctrine that brother BR was talking
[1:35:03] about was predestination election for
[1:35:05] knowledge and all that and many of this
[1:35:08] Brothers people come from the
[1:35:09] Pentecostal background which believed in
[1:35:12] legalism some were
[1:35:14] Methodist so whenever brother brandham
[1:35:17] asked him about that and he said yes
[1:35:18] brother brandham but a lot of my people
[1:35:20] don't believe
[1:35:22] that now some of yall know the rest of
[1:35:25] this quote but some of you I wonder what
[1:35:27] would be your idea to advise this
[1:35:30] brother to
[1:35:33] do I notice he quotes the scripture of
[1:35:36] the Lord Jesus I sanctify myself for
[1:35:38] their sake Jesus was training 12 men
[1:35:42] that through those 12 was to take the
[1:35:44] gospel to the world it said for their
[1:35:46] sake I sanctify myself make
[1:35:50] yourself for for your neighbor's
[1:35:53] sake for somebody else's sake so don't
[1:35:57] use your Liberty for a cloak said Paul
[1:35:59] but sanctify yourself behave yourself in
[1:36:02] the neighborhood like a real Christian
[1:36:05] ought to let your
[1:36:08] communication if you meet your
[1:36:11] enemy sanctify yourself for his sake not
[1:36:17] knowing what you might
[1:36:19] do so if you meet your enemy then what
[1:36:23] would the natural reaction for a lot of
[1:36:25] us be it would be get upset at our enemy
[1:36:28] you know say something or give him that
[1:36:30] look you know that he knows uh that look
[1:36:32] of disapproval but when you really learn
[1:36:35] to sanctify yourself more and more in a
[1:36:39] deeper consecration you start
[1:36:41] sanctifying yourself from within now
[1:36:44] notice he's not saying the spirit of
[1:36:46] God's going to do this but this is
[1:36:47] something we're supposed to do we're to
[1:36:50] sanctify oursel from within and by doing
[1:36:54] so we are expressing the greater work of
[1:36:57] God from within our
[1:36:59] soul I realize friends this is not very
[1:37:02] deep this morning but I'm actually
[1:37:03] preaching bride
[1:37:05] material so for those of you that are
[1:37:07] interested in going
[1:37:08] home there you go so if you meet your
[1:37:11] enemy sanctify yourself for San not
[1:37:14] knowing
[1:37:18] what what you
[1:37:22] not knowing what
[1:37:23] you might
[1:37:27] do and you're want to be a little
[1:37:30] Messiah here's your
[1:37:32] chance sanctify your
[1:37:34] temper sanctify your arrogance that also
[1:37:38] carries over on Tik Tok flipflop
[1:37:41] Instagram and all the rest is social
[1:37:43] media
[1:37:45] trash even some of our sisters I
[1:37:48] understand take the social media and
[1:37:50] preach a little bit sisters you ain't
[1:37:52] supposed to be handling the word either
[1:37:54] behind the pull pit or on Instagram Amen
[1:37:57] Brother D Amen brother Preacher Brother
[1:37:59] Donnie I'm with you brother glory to God
[1:38:01] well thank ke I'm glad y'all are back
[1:38:03] here cuz they sure ain't many I'm back
[1:38:08] here I think the sweetest
[1:38:13] scripture there is in all the
[1:38:17] Bible it's this
[1:38:19] scripture father I sanctify
[1:38:24] myself because of
[1:38:26] them the SC sweetest
[1:38:29] scripture in all the
[1:38:32] Bible he was a man he could have had a
[1:38:37] wife you say I was making that up a
[1:38:39] while ago he could have had a home place
[1:38:43] to lay his head he had rights to that he
[1:38:48] was a man he could have had good clothes
[1:38:52] but what did he say father I sanctify
[1:38:55] myself for their sake what was he doing
[1:38:59] he was training up 12 disciples that
[1:39:01] were going to preach the gospel in all
[1:39:03] the world he put an example and
[1:39:06] Brethren as ministers I'll tell you it
[1:39:09] pays us not to get too much of this
[1:39:12] world's
[1:39:14] goods and things hanging around us you
[1:39:18] preachers I'm talking to you
[1:39:25] you sanctify yourself from them that
[1:39:28] you're going to lead for them that
[1:39:31] you're going to lead that's what we need
[1:39:35] today is a complete
[1:39:37] consecrated Sanctified
[1:39:40] life of ministers
[1:39:43] amen you can go ahead and say Amen it
[1:39:46] ain't going to make me mad I'm going to
[1:39:47] say Amen with
[1:39:49] you hey this is part of the message I
[1:39:52] know we don't hear preachers read this
[1:39:54] very much but it's still the
[1:39:56] truth if we add more Sanctified
[1:39:59] preachers in the Pulpit but have more
[1:40:01] sanctified people in the
[1:40:06] pews notice he said Sanctified life of
[1:40:09] ministers that walk upright before God
[1:40:12] does not entangle with the things of the
[1:40:15] world keep from it father I sanctify
[1:40:17] myself for their sake for not because he
[1:40:20] had to
[1:40:23] but he did it for their
[1:40:26] sake Romans 12:1 that us change a
[1:40:30] bit I beseech you therefore
[1:40:33] Brethren by the mercies of god notice he
[1:40:37] makes those mercies plural I beseech you
[1:40:41] therefore Brethren by the mercies of God
[1:40:44] that ye
[1:40:46] present your
[1:40:48] bodies a living s
[1:40:53] sacrifice
[1:40:55] holy
[1:40:57] acceptable unto
[1:40:59] God which is your
[1:41:02] reasonable
[1:41:04] service
[1:41:05] amen I read that the I
[1:41:08] thought how is that even
[1:41:12] possible this was born between
[1:41:15] Dawn and Betty
[1:41:18] Reagan I was conceived in sin come to
[1:41:21] the world speaking
[1:41:24] lies give my heart to the Lord as a
[1:41:27] young boy been preaching since I was
[1:41:30] 18 be 50 years in a few
[1:41:36] months and yet this ain't got the Holy
[1:41:38] Ghost a bit more
[1:41:40] today than it haveen I give my heart to
[1:41:43] God years
[1:41:44] ago the flesh I'm talking
[1:41:47] about so how can I
[1:41:51] present this as a holy sacrifice so the
[1:41:54] difference between us now in the New
[1:41:56] Testament in the Old Testament was they
[1:41:58] presented
[1:42:00] dead
[1:42:01] sacrifices but Paul specifies I beseech
[1:42:04] you therefore brother by the mercies of
[1:42:06] God that you present your bodies as a
[1:42:10] Living Sacrifice so instead of me just
[1:42:13] killing it one time laying it on the ah
[1:42:16] there you go God do whatever you want to
[1:42:18] it well bury that old thing God don't
[1:42:19] want that God don't want your old dead
[1:42:21] hide God don't want your dead
[1:42:24] carcass got your God wants your old live
[1:42:29] carcass you you could only offer it
[1:42:32] once if you present it to him as a dead
[1:42:38] sacrifice but if you give it to him a
[1:42:40] Living
[1:42:42] Sacrifice you can do it every day oh
[1:42:45] glory to God you can do it every day day
[1:42:49] after day days lead to week weeks weeks
[1:42:51] lead to months months lead to years and
[1:42:53] years lead to decades and before long
[1:42:55] you've dedicated the rest of your entire
[1:42:57] life to him instead of bringing a dead
[1:43:00] carcass and laying it on an altar you
[1:43:03] sanctify yourself for your neighbor's
[1:43:05] sake you sanctify yourself for your
[1:43:08] enemy sake you sanctify yourself or
[1:43:11] maybe a brother in the church that
[1:43:13] there's something come between you but
[1:43:15] you sanctify yourself and try to make
[1:43:19] peace even though in reality he was the
[1:43:22] one that wronged
[1:43:24] you thank you Lord but remember even
[1:43:26] when we come to church sometimes we're
[1:43:29] not always dealing with sanctified
[1:43:33] people some people are Sanctified by
[1:43:36] God but they've never yet learned the
[1:43:39] latter part of that half of the equation
[1:43:41] and that is to sanctify themselves so
[1:43:45] that's why we have gossip in the church
[1:43:47] now we got visitors here today and I'll
[1:43:49] just preach our church here because I'm
[1:43:51] sure they don't have none of it where
[1:43:52] they go I know brother Jason's church
[1:43:54] and brother Luke Gibson church and my
[1:43:56] everybody there just just as sweet as
[1:43:59] honey I'm telling you what they ain't
[1:44:01] nothing but Angels them kind of ride
[1:44:09] motorcycles and we think because well I
[1:44:12] man I got sanctifying yours aone you
[1:44:14] know what love the message folks have
[1:44:15] done they think that sanctification is a
[1:44:18] one-time thing oh I got San I before got
[1:44:21] the Holy Ghost so I'll be sanctify the
[1:44:23] rest of my life you will be sanctifying
[1:44:25] that mouth of yours just about every
[1:44:27] time you open it up come on somebody you
[1:44:31] going to have to sanctify your thoughts
[1:44:33] you're going to have to sanctify when
[1:44:35] you go to the house of God somebody will
[1:44:37] get your parking spot somebody will get
[1:44:40] your favorite spot in the Pew we'll have
[1:44:42] to sanctify ourself when we come to the
[1:44:44] Lord when we come to service the devil
[1:44:47] will put that old thing in your mind oh
[1:44:49] I forgot to turn off the curling AR at
[1:44:51] home I forgot to turn off the crockpot I
[1:44:54] forgot to do this don't you understand
[1:44:55] what it is the devil trying to grab a
[1:44:58] hold of your mind but you sat there and
[1:45:00] say Satan in the name of Jesus I've come
[1:45:03] to Worship the Lord I've come to praise
[1:45:06] God my hands are Sanctified my feet are
[1:45:10] Sanctified my voice is Sanctified I set
[1:45:13] them aside for Jesus
[1:45:18] Christ Hallelujah
[1:45:21] [Applause]
[1:45:24] can I have a few more
[1:45:27] minutes so God's presence in the
[1:45:30] Tabernacle and in the temple made them
[1:45:36] holy watch in Matthew
[1:45:39] 23:16 woe unto you you blind Gods which
[1:45:42] say whosoever shall swear by the temple
[1:45:45] it is
[1:45:46] nothing but whosoever shall swear by the
[1:45:48] gold of the Temple
[1:45:51] he is a
[1:45:52] deor you fools and
[1:45:56] blind for whether is greater the
[1:46:00] gold or the temple that
[1:46:04] sanctifies the
[1:46:09] gold and whosoever shall SAR by the
[1:46:12] altar it is nothing but whosoever swears
[1:46:15] by the gift look how backwards they had
[1:46:18] it the gift that is upon it he is guilty
[1:46:22] you
[1:46:23] fools don't you love Jesus gentle
[1:46:26] mannerism you fools and blind for
[1:46:29] whether is the greater the gift or the
[1:46:32] altar so they were magnifying the
[1:46:36] gift when the gift itself had not the
[1:46:39] altar Sanctified it could not even be
[1:46:41] accepted and look how they had changed
[1:46:44] oh children I'm afraid now that was the
[1:46:46] end of the Jewish ages and now we are
[1:46:49] the end of the Gentile ages and if we're
[1:46:50] not careful the same thing is happening
[1:46:53] again we're going to magnify the gift
[1:46:56] over the giver we're going to magnify
[1:46:58] the gifts come on I believe in the gifts
[1:47:00] but I do not believe gifts take
[1:47:02] precedent over the word of God every
[1:47:06] gift should be subject to God's word and
[1:47:09] God's message for the hour and the word
[1:47:12] and the message will sanctify our gifts
[1:47:16] if we will allow it if not they will be
[1:47:19] rampant and reproduction of
[1:47:21] 1906 Aza
[1:47:28] street so you bring your Al your gift to
[1:47:31] The
[1:47:32] Altar and the way they looked at
[1:47:35] it the gift was greater than the Altar
[1:47:39] and the gift ofin itself had no ability
[1:47:41] to transform or
[1:47:44] change but you placed the gift on the
[1:47:47] altar it leaves my
[1:47:49] hands and God changes it it's now
[1:47:57] accepted so if a consecrated piece of
[1:48:00] chatim wood overlaid in Gold a little
[1:48:03] bit of
[1:48:05] silver if that could transform a normal
[1:48:09] sacrifice I wonder what
[1:48:11] God in my soul and God in your soul
[1:48:17] would be able to do to our body brother
[1:48:19] Harold we would just allow it to be so
[1:48:22] and see this is what and you feel you
[1:48:24] feel so terrible said well this so
[1:48:26] stinking thing about me I'm so rotten
[1:48:28] I'm no good I'm this that why should I
[1:48:30] even worship God this old body of mine
[1:48:32] we need to move up I hope you understand
[1:48:35] what this morning is this morning is a
[1:48:38] call for us to come higher was a higher
[1:48:42] understanding that oh glory to God that
[1:48:44] the Eternal himself that lives in our
[1:48:48] soul wants to San sanctify our body and
[1:48:52] make the uplifting of our hands as
[1:48:54] Holiness unto the Lord and the sacrifice
[1:48:58] of our lips acceptable in the presence
[1:49:02] of God it is not coming out of a
[1:49:04] sinner's mouth these are not Sinners
[1:49:07] hands I don't smoke I don't drink I
[1:49:10] don't run around but my body is
[1:49:13] Sanctified by the Living God which is
[1:49:17] deity inside of my soul there for I can
[1:49:21] lift holy hands I can lift holy
[1:49:34] hands at the Corinthian Church remember
[1:49:38] a lot of Gentiles there mainly Greeks
[1:49:41] mixed in with Jews some of them that had
[1:49:44] gotten saved and a question began to
[1:49:46] raise up among them should the saved
[1:49:49] wife leave the unsaved husband or should
[1:49:53] the saved husband leave the unsaved wife
[1:49:57] because Judaism basically taught the
[1:49:59] same thing that if a Jew to marry a
[1:50:01] gentile their children were not
[1:50:03] holy they were illegitimate same with
[1:50:06] the Romans which is hard to believe as
[1:50:08] vile as they were yet they T that if
[1:50:10] another person if you want your husband
[1:50:12] or your wife accepted some sort of other
[1:50:15] religion that you should actually
[1:50:17] divorce them because your house is not
[1:50:20] clean your house is
[1:50:23] divided but watch Paul yes amen and the
[1:50:26] woman which ha a husband that believeth
[1:50:28] not if he be pleased to dwell with her
[1:50:32] let her not leave him am would you
[1:50:36] notice that it doesn't say let her put
[1:50:37] him away cuz that wasn't the way he
[1:50:40] believed it let her not leave him for
[1:50:44] the
[1:50:46] unbelieving husband yes amen is
[1:50:51] Sanctified
[1:50:56] GL I about had me a spell the other day
[1:50:58] and the Lord was putting this together
[1:51:00] I'm telling
[1:51:01] you the
[1:51:03] unbelieving husband is
[1:51:07] Sanctified by the wife can you imagine

[1:56:21] continually that is the fruit remember
[1:56:23] fruit is
[1:56:25] progeny mixing together two things upper
[1:56:28] and lower
[1:56:30] lip new births inside the soul produce
[1:56:34] mixed together with a Sanctified body
[1:56:36] what does it produce a sacrifice of
[1:56:39] praise a sacrifice of praise notice the
[1:56:42] prophet said the Bible said you're a
[1:56:44] royal priesthood A peculiar people
[1:56:47] offering spiritual sacrifices to God the
[1:56:50] fruits of your lips giving praise unto
[1:56:52] him oh my the fruits of your lips
[1:56:55] pouring up praise daily before the
[1:56:58] people what a high priest we have what a
[1:57:02] high priest or priesthood that we're in
[1:57:06] oh come on now don't you love that he
[1:57:08] didn't just stop with Jesus what a high
[1:57:11] priest we have and what a priesthood we
[1:57:14] are in in the priesthood of the
[1:57:17] circumcision not of the flesh but of the
[1:57:20] heart amen the heart circumcised by the
[1:57:23] Holy Ghost that's right then you can
[1:57:25] offer praise and adoration to God the
[1:57:29] spiritual
[1:57:31] sacrifice your lips pouring out praise
[1:57:35] unto him again they are peculiar people
[1:57:37] of royal priesthood offering spiritual
[1:57:40] sacrifice giving praise to God listen to
[1:57:43] these next words whether they feel like
[1:57:46] it or
[1:57:48] not
[1:57:53] Hallelujah whether they feel like it or
[1:57:56] not that's when it really
[1:57:59] becomes a
[1:58:02] sacrifice
[1:58:05] stand spiritual Amnesia God's church and
[1:58:08] his people has always been a separated
[1:58:10] people a called out people A peculiar
[1:58:14] people a holy nation a royal priesthood
[1:58:18] offering spiritual sacrifices to God the
[1:58:23] fruits of their lips giving praise to
[1:58:26] his name God called his church and
[1:58:29] separated it from the
[1:58:31] world for that very
[1:58:35] purpose God didn't just save you to save
[1:58:39] you he saved you to love
[1:58:43] him he saved you to praise him to
[1:58:46] worship
[1:58:48] Him
[1:58:52] I got to read one more is it
[1:58:55] okay we'll pick it up again but notice
[1:58:57] this about worship I hope this
[1:59:00] transforms the way you think about
[1:59:03] worship we should not Worship the Lord
[1:59:05] just after we get through preaching the
[1:59:08] word as we usually do just worship him
[1:59:11] that's
[1:59:12] wonderful but we should worship him
[1:59:14] every hour of our
[1:59:16] life when we're at work
[1:59:20] we should worship him but now notice
[1:59:22] what he says this
[1:59:23] is every time the opportunity presents
[1:59:26] itself Worship the
[1:59:29] Lord by testifying of
[1:59:33] him so it's not just you standing be
[1:59:35] your machine that you work at at work or
[1:59:37] you driving down the road but
[1:59:39] worship is also reaching out to others
[1:59:43] amen watch if you see some of you ladies
[1:59:47] see a woman in the wrong Worship the
[1:59:52] Lord by taking her and saying
[1:59:55] sister there's a better life than this
[1:59:59] amen
[2:00:01] wow you mean that is worshiping
[2:00:07] God worshiping
[2:00:09] God you man at your work when you hear a
[2:00:12] man using the name of the Lord in vain
[2:00:14] and you get a chance to one side and
[2:00:17] slip over and take it by the hand and
[2:00:19] say Amen there's a better life than this
[2:00:23] you shouldn't use those words and tell
[2:00:25] him in a Meek and GLE way all those
[2:00:29] things is a
[2:00:33] worship and when you see someone sick
[2:00:37] and the doctor says there's no more that
[2:00:39] can be
[2:00:40] done we ought to worship
[2:00:44] God by telling them there's a God in
[2:00:47] heaven that answers prayer
[2:00:49] [Music]
[2:00:51] now let's be honest would we have ever
[2:00:53] thought that would be
[2:00:59] worship so you mean by
[2:01:03] sharing that the Lord Jesus Is A Healer
[2:01:05] a savior a redeemer you are worshiping
[2:01:08] God and your you thought it was just
[2:01:10] about
[2:01:12] this true divine worship is coming out
[2:01:16] of your regenerate Soul pouring through
[2:01:18] lips
[2:01:19] of a Sanctified
[2:01:22] Tabernacle
[2:01:26] Hallelujah I said one
[2:01:31] more it keeps growing I'm
[2:01:35] sorry I love this listen to this I'm
[2:01:37] going to close for
[2:01:38] sure I believe that Christian
[2:01:42] Life is a
[2:01:45] continual
[2:01:47] sacrifice he that will come after to me
[2:01:49] let him deny himself daily every day not
[2:01:51] 46 days of course he's speaking about
[2:01:52] Linton let every day take up his cross
[2:01:55] and follow me said Jesus not just 46 but
[2:01:58] every day Jesus actually spoke about
[2:02:00] your cross more than he spoke about his
[2:02:02] own look how many times in the gospels
[2:02:05] he mentioned you taking up your cross
[2:02:07] and see how many times he talked about
[2:02:09] himself taking up his he knew the harder
[2:02:11] battle wouldn't be himself it'd be
[2:02:15] us oh how the Christian loves to to it
[2:02:20] he doesn't do it with a grudge he
[2:02:23] doesn't oh he he does it with a a
[2:02:26] feeling that he loves God and he's glad
[2:02:30] he can do it it's a joy to serve the
[2:02:33] Lord Jesus it's a joy to sacrifice it's
[2:02:35] a joy to Worship the Lord It's a joy to
[2:02:39] be called a
[2:02:40] fanatic for the kingdom of God's
[2:02:47] sake praise the
[2:02:53] Lord some of y'all said praise God for
[2:02:56] the first
[2:02:59] time so I ask you Priests of
[2:03:04] God in a little bit you'll be walking
[2:03:06] out them
[2:03:11] doors what till we going to
[2:03:14] do but Brother Don I've wasted so many
[2:03:16] years forget all the waste what are you
[2:03:19] going to do from today
[2:03:21] forward don't do a bit of good to spend
[2:03:23] all of our time Walling on our mistakes
[2:03:25] and we've all done all that but what are
[2:03:27] we going to do from this day
[2:03:32] forward as Priests of the most high
[2:03:36] God we have been Anointed with an
[2:03:41] anointing the eagle
[2:03:44] anointing of the last
[2:03:47] days to loose the seals to release the
[2:03:50] Thunders the voice of God to
[2:03:54] release a building of a body of God on
[2:03:57] the
[2:03:59] earth that would actually come to such a
[2:04:01] state of
[2:04:02] maturity their completion and Perfection
[2:04:06] will call for the rest of the
[2:04:11] dead I'm not just waiting to see my
[2:04:13] little
[2:04:14] girl I'm wanting to see Paul and Peter
[2:04:18] amen James and John when the
[2:04:21] resurrection happens it's going to be
[2:04:23] all of
[2:04:24] them it ain't going to just be those
[2:04:26] from our church those from our age they
[2:04:29] are all
[2:04:31] waiting on
[2:04:34] us
[2:04:40] Hallelujah
[2:04:42] Jesus if God can sanctify us on his part
[2:04:46] and then us sanctify us the rest rest of
[2:04:49] the way and lay aside our you our
[2:04:52] differences and our doctrines and sure
[2:04:54] we're always going to have things and
[2:04:55] there there's certain stands we have to
[2:04:56] take that we cannot compromise on no but
[2:04:59] I'm talking about things many things
[2:05:00] that we argue and fuss about it don't
[2:05:02] even pertain to Salvation in the first
[2:05:04] place and if we can go to loving one
[2:05:06] another and praying for one another even
[2:05:08] though we don't agree with one another
[2:05:09] my goodness how many people agreed with
[2:05:11] Jesus and they prayed for all of them
[2:05:13] look at the prophet of God what an
[2:05:14] attitude look at the spirit I don't just
[2:05:16] study this message I study the spirit
[2:05:19] this message was delivered in you know I
[2:05:21] find that messenger saying people throw
[2:05:23] him out he just draw a Bricker circle
[2:05:25] they' throw him out that Circle he draw
[2:05:26] a bigger one they throw out that she
[2:05:28] kept on drawing a bigger
[2:05:29] one well come on somebody boy if anybody
[2:05:33] throws us out of the circle GL to God
[2:05:34] I'm turn them over to the devil
[2:05:35] Hallelujah they repat their serpent seat
[2:05:38] now show me where the prophet of God or
[2:05:39] the Lord Jesus had that attitude he kept
[2:05:42] praying for him father forgive them for
[2:05:43] they don't know what they do and I don't
[2:05:45] mind telling you I'm going to go ahead
[2:05:47] and say it I don't figure there's
[2:05:48] anybody here today that don't need a
[2:05:49] closer walk with God I don't fig there's
[2:05:51] none of us here today that ain't messed

[2:06:50] able to stop
[2:07:00] him
[2:07:02] Hallelujah par
[2:07:08] it Lord God what an awesome day to be
[2:07:14] living dear Jesus I come before you
[2:07:17] today
[2:07:19] as a priest of
[2:07:23] God my brothers and sisters also
[2:07:28] come I don't come as their priest
[2:07:31] necessarily and that I'm above them and
[2:07:34] greater than them and have a greater
[2:07:35] position than
[2:07:37] them I come with
[2:07:40] them every daughter of God standing here
[2:07:43] today Born Again filled with the Holy
[2:07:46] Ghost is part of the priesthood of of
[2:07:50] God I remember that day when that little
[2:07:54] woman had that baby and it was crying
[2:07:55] and
[2:07:56] crying little sister satting there in a
[2:07:58] chair felt so sorry for her gave her her
[2:08:03] seat she had a prayer card and she said
[2:08:06] honey God just keep putting it on my
[2:08:08] heart to pray for you old baby I know
[2:08:10] brother Ram's going to pray for it but
[2:08:11] would you just let me pray for it just
[2:08:13] kind of get this out why sure dear go
[2:08:16] ahead that little sister laid her hands
[2:08:18] on that
[2:08:19] baby the woman come in the prayer line
[2:08:23] God shows the Prophet The
[2:08:24] Vision he does not rebuke that woman for
[2:08:27] praying for her but he said God healed
[2:08:30] her whenever the woman prayed for her
[2:08:32] but brother Randon was not after
[2:08:34] arrogance and pride well glory to God I
[2:08:36] prayed for him so that puts another
[2:08:37] feather in my hat he didn't have
[2:08:39] feathers in his hat he wanted all the
[2:08:42] glory to go to
[2:08:44] you and he said the reason was that
[2:08:47] little mother could have a Fe feeling
[2:08:49] that maybe he couldn't
[2:08:52] have the same way father whenever they'd
[2:08:54] bring a cross-eyed child across the
[2:08:56] platform there wasn't a one of them not
[2:09:00] a one of them that ever walked off that
[2:09:01] wasn't healed
[2:09:04] why recalling his little Sharon rose
[2:09:07] laying there eyes crossed with the
[2:09:09] pain it puts such a feeling in the heart
[2:09:12] of this
[2:09:15] priest many of us can share with those
[2:09:17] things Lord
[2:09:19] may we walk out of here today brothers
[2:09:21] sisters ministers non- ministers

[2:11:18] of God comes in his car where he's at

[2:11:23] brother why cuz a daughter of God obeyed
[2:11:26] the Holy Ghost and Sanctified her
[2:11:29] time praise the Lord oh Jesus I wonder

[2:11:42] Sanctified the preachers you've
[2:11:44] Sanctified a
[2:11:47] wife is I accorded to him the other the
[2:11:49] other night that for many thousands of
[2:11:51] years the Jewish vows of a man taking a
[2:11:56] wife would be
[2:11:58] thou sanctify thee unto me according to
[2:12:02] the law of
[2:12:04] Moses and of
[2:12:06] Israel be thou
[2:12:09] Sanctified unto me according to the law
[2:12:13] of
[2:12:14] Moses and of
[2:12:17] Israel
[2:12:18] what I've heard today is you saying to
[2:12:22] your
[2:12:23] bride my wife my spouse my
[2:12:29] beloved be thou Sanctified unto
[2:12:33] me for I am the

[2:12:42] Jesus we worship you
[2:12:46] father and many but just just like to
[2:12:48] take a few moments and maybe just have a
[2:12:51] rededication service this morning it
[2:12:53] ain't been that long since we dedicated
[2:12:55] this building but maybe we could just
[2:12:58] rededicate
[2:13:00] ourselves our praise our time our
[2:13:04] thoughts you know it already I don't
[2:13:06] need to tell you but one of the greatest
[2:13:09] shortages that we have in this day is
[2:13:13] time remember that message I preached to
[2:13:15] you years ago the bondage of time never
[2:13:20] enough time are they Satan's got more
[2:13:23] and more and more things to occupy our
[2:13:27] time than ever before and the difficult
[2:13:30] part about it is many of those things
[2:13:31] are not sinful they are not wrong but we
[2:13:35] just give so much time to this and time
[2:13:37] to that the prophet said as far as he
[2:13:41] knew he never stole anything in his
[2:13:45] life but he had stole
[2:13:49] time from
[2:13:52] God maybe many of you have not stole one
[2:13:55] thing since you've got
[2:13:57] saved but I wonder how many of us have
[2:13:59] stole
[2:14:01] time time that he
[2:14:04] wants oh
[2:14:06] Hallelujah Lord God I bless your name
[2:14:09] Jesus please forgive
[2:14:12] me please forgive me
