TRANSCRIPT
========================================
e e will announce oh my the priest would announce so that everybody that's around him will know that this person is a leper now catch this he takes upon the name of a leper so he receives a name change and now he's going to be called by the disease that has inflicted his body he's going to be called by that disease he will live underneath that name he will walk underneath that name he will no longer be called friend because he is a leper he will no longer be called brother because he is a leper he's no longer dad he's no longer husband he's no longer Uncle because he's received a name change he is a leper he takes upon him the name of the leper and the leprosy changes their entire life he's removed from the camp he becomes contagious among the people to where wherever he goes it affects everything that is around him because he has leprosy that's the reason why that God sends Ministry in the last days to preach against sin to preach against unbelief because if leprosy starts in the church and it starts amongst the people it will not stop just with one or just with the other but it has the tendency to move from one to another to another so it must be pronounced over the entire congregation he he is a leper notice that he says this in verse 44 he is a leprous man he is unclean and the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean his plague is in his head and the leper whom the plague is his clothes shall be rent his head bear he shall be put Upon A covering over his upper lip lip and he shall cry unclean I want you to catch this he's now going to take and he's going to Veil himself he's going to Veil his face he's going to Veil his lips and now he's going to actually change the way he talks now he's going to pronounce what the priest has already said he's going to tell them I'm unclean and in the days when the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled he is unclean he shall dwell alone without the camp shall be his habitation I want you to listen this he becomes separated from the camp because he is infected there's a separation that takes place because of leprosy can I say it like this there comes a Chasm between the leper and the priest between the leper and the congregation he is banished he is separated he has set aside he's placed outside the camp anybody hear me they are considered the lowest part of society they are considered to be the outcast nobody wants to be around them they are contaminated they don't have no Fellowship they ain't got no friends they don't feel no love they have no help you know why because they are lepers leprosy affects the nerves of the body he's unable to sense they can't feel feel right now and the longer they have it the more desensitized they become and their fingers are so broke open that they get injured so easy they can knock their finger wide open and they don't even realize that they're hurt it's because of the disease that is upon them they become desensitized they become unaware and the bacteria eats away at the body till they don't even look human no more they discharge a fluid oh listen their sores would ease with fluid and it would create a foul stench everywhere that they go their eyebrows would fall out their eyes become staring and red and their eyebrows as it falls out and their hair is gone you can imagine looking at one like this and then their voice will become so horse and my they would sound so raspy and that and their breath would just be wheezes because of the aome ations that was running up and now their vocal cords to where you can hear them wheezing and their hands and their feet they would ulcerate slowly they would suffer day in and day out until they become so listen so controlled by these these parts of their bodies that has been busted open they would live an average about nine years and at the end listen to me at the end is mental Decay at the end in they're not thinking right they slip into a coma they die early and the suffer becomes so repulsive he does not listen to me not only does he become repulsive to everybody that is around him he becomes repulsive to himself and as they are required to cover themselves because of their sores because of their wounds they would take and cover their face and whenever the leper went he had to give warning of what he is he had to give a warning of what his is he would tell everybody I'm unclean I'm unclean he would repeat the words of the priest Hallelujah he would say I'm unclean he would say it over and over again think about it he's identified by his speech he's identified by his confession he's identified by his profession his confession is I'm unclean he's identified by the way he talked he's identified by the way he walked he was ident ified by War he War they would take the garments think about they dress different than the rest of the congregation his confession is different than the rest of the congregation his clothes are different than the rest of the congregation his walk is different his speech is different the lover the leop would cover themselves they would make themselves a covering and he was identified where he lived at he could not live in homes he would live in the colony of the lepers around others that was just like him that's the law of the leper and I know today that is a terrible sight to be able to paint before a congregation it's a disgusting picture that someone whose life would become so contaminated to where their life would ooze and ooze everywhere they go and many times they would take and their life is such a stench oozing infecting everything they touch wherever their feet would walk they would infect where they would go and their face is unbearable to look at and that is the leper they're defiled by their actions if he drank from a vessel The Vessel was to be destroyed if he laid upon the bed the bed become unclean because whoever lays on the bed after a leopard they become unclean just like the leper Oh Glory if he touch the wall the house was unclean think about it wherever he went he tainted the atmosphere everywhere that he went and I know that's terrible but let me say this there's something far worse than natural leprosy and that is the leprosy of the Soul because that is exactly what every one of us was today no matter if you was raised in the message no matter if you cut your teeth on the back of a message Pew every one of us was born in that condition we was born contaminated we was born oooing everything we touch become contaminated our voice towed upon us our hands toed upon us we was desensitized by sin we was desensitized by the world every one of us was born lepers our eyes was polluted our ears was polluted our speech was polluted the songwriters sing it like this we was lost and undone without God or his son Our Lives produced an odor that was unbearable oh you see where I'm going it was unbearable in the presence of God It produced a stench that God could not stand we had this disease because we was defiled we was defiled by our actions and the words that we spoke and everywhere we went we was clining unclean by our lives everywhere we announced we're contagious you better get back you better get away we confessed our unclean we confessed our problems amen we confessed what we was we said we're alcoholics we said we was drug addicts we said we had all kind why is it it's because our voice told us that we was tainted with his leprosy the prophet said it like this leprosy symbolizes sin incurable listen where especially in its last stage so at the last stage of leprosy it's to totally uncurable again an influence leprosy represents it's a typ rather of sin and when a man won't stand correction by the word he's full of leprosy he blows up and Carries On Again the influence of another leprosy why I'd rather have leprosy any that kind of leprosy any time than that kind that's the leprosy of the Soul so when it comes to leprosy think about this when the scripture talks about this leprosy must be cleansed almost every time the scripture mentions it it talks about the cleansing of a leper it talks about the cleansing so in order for a leper to be cleansed he must come into the presence of the high priest Hallelujah I said he's got to come into the presence of the high priest and the high priest that confessed and said he was a leper the one that said he was unclean the law that pointed out what he was that same high priest amen has to confess that he is [Applause] clean do you realize there ain't no man can be saved unless he confesses that he's saved there's something about the words that comes out of your mouth you must confess there must be something that comes from the soul and the Very heart of a man that gives him the desire to be dead different leprosy has to be cleansed and when it comes to our sin when it come to your spiritual leprosy our sin could only be cleansed by the high priest there was only one thing that could loose us from the law of this leper and I want to tell you what it is it's the blood of Jesus Christ God accepted a substitute of the blood from the very beginning and that blood is just as powerful right now it's just as good right now as it was the day that he shed it 2,000 years come on somebody say Amen I'm talking about a perfect blood I'm talking about a blood that can lose a man I'm talking about a blood that can change a man I'm talking about a blood that can pick you up and take your defiled life and then stop up the oozi and stop the defilement so not only with the high priest which caused him to be banished and to be separated and placed outside the camp Not only would he be required to tell him that he would live in a Barren solitary empty place but I want to tell you not only did God say that there's a way to deal with it but God also to instituted a way to get back I said there's a way back I want to tell you tonight I don't care who you are are I don't care what you're dealing with I don't care what mistake you made I don't care how dark your life is there is a way back today there is a way back from leprosy there's a way back from oozing there's a way back from sin there is still a way back today I don't care how wretched you are I don't care how deed you are there is a way back for every believer there's a way that's been provided when a leper gets loosed it proves that there's a higher law that supersedes the law of the leper there's a l glory god institutes a way for a leper to get back now catch this and let me go this direction now remember when Moses had went down into Egypt he was there oh how can I paint him today he was there to set the captives free he was there for the purpose of Deliverance he's there to get man out of bondage he's there to be able to receive that which was already God and already belonged to God he's there to get them back he's there to lead them back but you see Moses went but it was more than Moses it was Christ in Moses now watch what God's going to do God was going to vindicate before phara that notice he's going to vindicate that the one is speaking to him is the one that's sent to bring deliverance and God is going to validate this Prophet before pharaoh and God tells Moses this is what I want you to do I want you to take your hand Moses and I want you to put it inside of your bosom and Moses takes his hand and he puts it in his bosom think about it friends he put it over his heart and when he put it over his bosom he pulled his hand out it's full of leprosy now watch not just leprosy leprosy in its last stages now you don't understand it's the worst that it can get it it's it's destined to die there's no way to get around it it is the last stages of leprosy and when he pulls his hands out he sees his hand is full of leprosy in the last stages and then God says Moses put your hand h Hallelujah put your hand back into your bosom and when he pulled it out the second time Hallelujah when he pulled it out the second time his hand was completely clean let me just tell you Moses's hand was originally [Applause] clean Moses's hand was originally clean but when he poured it out like your first birth and you come out notice it was defiled you had sin you had unbelief it was oooing it was bleeding it had leprosy in the last stages but then God said Moses put your hand Hallelujah put your hand back into your bosom Moses put it back where it originally was put it back where it belongs at put it back over your heart you see under our first birth we was all born the way Moses pulled his hand out the first time we was born in the last stages of leprosy we was all contaminated that's what our first birth did to us the law found us Guilty by the law of the leopard by our first birth we was found guilty because of leprosy but something happened I said something happened I'm preaching to you somebody Shout with me a minute I said something happened I want to say that ain't the end of the story that ain't the last thing God said that ain't the last thing God wanted but I want to tell you God said Moses take your hand put it back in there you take that right hand Moses put it back over your heart put it back over your bosom put it back in Christ put it back under the blood put it back in there put it back to the attribute Hallelujah so he put his hand back into his bosom and I want to tell you when you get born again when you get born again when you come in the second time by a new birth anybody believe that today we come back the original way that God intended for us to be we are completely unadulterated we are undefiled we are uncontaminated we are clean in the sight of God because Hallelujah because of our new birth he has changed us he has changed us he has changed you he's changed me our first birth represents the Law which we was bound by but your second birth represents Grace represents the power of the blood represents the power of atonement Grace has the ability to lose every leper Hallelujah and when I came back to the bosom of God I come back to where I come out of I come out initially unclean but that was not my original attribute that was not my original identity as a son I was not an originally a leper I was always a Son of God so he takes that clean hand put it in there Moses I want to let you know that's what every one of us was Paul says it like this for you are dead I'm talking about what happened happened to your leper for you are dead and your life Isam said Moses put his hand in his bosom it became leprosy like every man is to begin with a sinner by Nature there's no way around it you're born in sin shape into iniquity you come to this world speaking lies but then there is another God said put your hand into your bosom listen to him over your heart he put his hands again at the at the commission of God where he was brought forth firsthand a leper and brother says you were brought forth by God now read this next part not by but by Nature so by Nature think about underneath the humanity part it was not by choice that we was born lepers it was by Natures because of the law that man was born under after the fall in the Garden of Eden every one of us was born contaminated but then he says then you go back again when he come out you may not even be able to say Amen to this but I'm going to say it anyway the hand was clean and and I want to tell you if you didn't have a choice the way you come out of the bosom the first time what makes you think you got a choice when it comes out of the bosom of God by a supernatural birth of the word by the pull of the spirit of God upon you listen friend it's not something you chose it's not something I chose it's a Divine Oracle of God as a attribute son Hallelujah that God seen you originally as an attribute of God you didn't even have a choice again why it had to be Shepherds now here he stands holding his right hand over his heart standing like this where the hidden secret of Redemption where the S hidden secrets of redemption had been hid since the foundation of the world listen what he says Jesus is God's right hand take your right hand Moses I don't want you to put it back in there again take your right hand of power this time take your Authority Moes Jesus is God's right hand we all know there Moses betrayed him exactly he held the secrets of the father and he has showed them unto us don't you see you was hidden in the bosom of God and his hand listen to me his hand had to pull you out his hand had to reach into the secret part of the word oh my the mystery that was in his mind before the foundation well and he pushed oh my all the way past your leprosy past all the defilement and he reached in [Music] there and he pulled you out I said the right hand pull me out Hallelujah I said the right hand pull me out how about you did he pull you out you couldn't pull yourself out you didn't have the ability to pull yourself out but the right hand of God Amen he reached back into the very Eternal mind of God and he pulled you out which tells us our origination as an attribute was not something you become it's something you always was come on this is a debate people have right here well don't you tell me that Brother David I know I know I'm a Son of God made me a Son of God I know he made me a Son of God because he gave me the holy ghost that ain't true on come on God didn't give you the Holy Ghost to make you a Son of God God gave you the Holy Ghost because you always was a Son of God it's not God changing what you are but it's what you originally was in the mind of God in the bosom of God what your original identity was this Union and you're standing completely you never sinned at the God don't even know it it's in the sea of forgivness you never did it you were accused by the accuser but really from the beginning from the beginning from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God and you're standing there washed and your old book of divorcement is put away it's dead it's absolutely out of existence even in the mind You're The Virtuous bride of Christ washed in the blood precious virtuous sinless Son of God standing with a pure a pure a pure not odors not stench not defilement not contaminated pure unadulterated bride word that he Washed by the Water of his own blood that become flesh listen he be become flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the where was you predestinated at in the bosom of God you was in the bosom of the father from the beginning so the same as he was is the same that you are think about it when God needed Christ to be manifest upon the Earth God poured my within his great being and out of God he manifested himself in a human body let me tell you if it's that way in the groove what about the bride today if you're an attribute son and daughter of God will he not pull you out the same way so it was a law that put him out but it's going to be the blood that puts him back in wo preach with me somebody it was a law that declared me a sinner it was the law that declared me unclean it was a law that separated me but it the blood that cleansed me it was the blood that took away my [Applause] sin I want to ask you today what can wash away my sin there's power in the blood of Jesus no matter how decrepit no matter how defiled no matter how down TR TR you you may be there is power to loose a leper there's power to save a sinner there's power to heal the sick there's power to bring you back into the camp God can catch any man he can catch any teenager he can catch any young boy he can catch any young girl he can catch any person that's went [Applause] wavered he can reach you he can reach your lost loved ones I don't care if they're sitting on a bar I don't care if they got needles stuck in their arm it don't matter the condition it don't matter how black it doesn't matter how defiled God can catch [Music] them the hand of God can reach down where they are at and I want to tell you he's not only can he do it but he has done it and he'll do it again he will reach people that you don't think can make it he'll reach people that you gave up on he reaches people that I gave up on but God had never gave up on them God takes his right hand and that right hand is so powerful that position of authority can reach down to where he [Music] is the one that can take the book out of the of him that sit on the throne think about it there's power in the arms of the Lord I manyan we got a witness their salvation in the arms of the Lord because the arm symbolizes strengths it symbolizes Redemption it symbolizes power David said it like this oh singing of the Lord a new song for he had done marvelous things his right hand his Hallelujah his holy arm have gotten him the victory again Deuteronomy 7:19 the great Temptations With Thine Eyes saw and the signs and the Wonders and the mighty hand there and the stretched out arm where by the Lord thy God brought thee out did he not when they come out of Egypt think about what God did God reached down where they was at and God brought them out of the bondage did he deliver them oh yes did he bring them out oh yes how did God deliver them from Egypt and Egypt is a type of how did he deliver them Exodus 6 and6 I say unto the children of Israel I am the Lord h Hallelujah and I might if I get enough strength if I feel like it if you're good enough if you pray enough if you read enough I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians and I will rid you out of their bondage is that not powerful not your bondage I'm going to R you out of their bondage and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm right here in Exodus he's revealing every mystery of what he's fixing to do Under the first Exodus he's revealing how he's going to redeem every person how's he going to do it he's going to do it by his hand he's going to do it by his arm he's going to stretch are you hearing me are you getting it today look at this how's he going to redeem me he's going to redeem me with an outstretched arm that's how he's going to redeem me that's how he's going to bring me out he's going to stretch his arm arm all the way out and let me tell you this his arm can reach you his arm can reach me his blood can separate sin as far as the East is from the West he stretched out his arms and he brought you in to his bosom back where you originally was with an outstretched [Applause] arm Hallelujah he would see how defiled how you would ooze he would hear your speech unclean unclean unclean as they would walk around and they would cover up their face unclean unclean and Jesus looked at you as he did the leper that day he looked at you as he did name and I want to tell you and he looked past your leprosy he looked past your lips he looked past your nose he looked past your oo and hands he looked past your stance and he reached down to where you was at Hallelujah and he crossed the chasm and he pulled you out hallelujah oh I feel like shouting a little while and the Lord spake un Moses saying this is going to be the law of the leper and the days of cleansing now watch us go up he shall be brought into the priest and the priest shall go forth out of the camp are you hearing me in other words he knew you couldn't get to where he was because you was too dirty he was too defiled he was too unclean so I want to tell you what he did he left the camp I said he condescended from the camp and he came all the ways he stretched his tent all the way from Heaven down to earth and what did he do he come forth out of the camp and the priest shall look and behold if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper then shall shall the priest listen to this then shall the priest command go ahead and say it take for him to be cleansed two birds of Life Cedar scarlet and some faith and the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earth and vessel over the spirit running water not stagnant not dead church not a dead move not a move of yesterday but running water God don't like stagnant anything he don't like stagnant ponds he don't like stagnant systems he don't like stagnant Wells he don't like stagnant churches everything that God has has got some movement to it aren't you glad that he does and I want to tell you they may try to take our message and try to will it down to just some type of emotional workup but I want to tell you before they ever said it I already had this I already had a joy in my soul I already had a dance in my step this ain't something new to me we've been doing this since the pillar of Fire came and tabernacled himself inside of our so this ain't something new it's been going on for years you may not have been do it but I have as for the living bir and and amazing people try well this is some great new move are you kidding this is the oldest move there ever has [Applause] been the bride didn't start this Aus stre didn't start this neither did the day of Pentecost start this but remember God asked Joe where was you when the morning Stars s together and all the sons of God shouted for Joy this is the oldest religion of the world let me tell you that's what I was in the bosom of God I was an attribute rejoicing about my salvation in Jesus Christ this is the oldest religion in the world as for the living bird bride believer Saint he shall take it and the cedar the Scarlet the hisop shall dip them in the living bird in the blood in the blood of the bird that was killed verse seven he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from leprosy seven times com listen to this and when he pronounces him he's going to say something opposite than what he said when he found you guilty but if he can declare me unclean if something else happens he can declare me righteous in the sight of God come on what is righteous the state of him is he is as he ought to be he shall pronounce him pronounce him clean and shall set the living bird loose think about it now there's a new confession and there's some new speech there's a further revelation of the word one bird pays the price the other bird gets Loos one bird suffers one Bird Goes free one bird sheds the blood the other one receives the blood and after he receives the blood he don't sit on a Pew he don't get stagnant but he starts putting that word together and he has the mechanics but now he needs the Dynamics and the Bible says that bird would fly away he would take him to an open field and they would loose that bird and that bird would take the Old Testament and the New Testament he would go to putting those wings into action and everywhere he went the blood amen the same way that the defilement of leprosy would Ooze from his body now the blood the blood's dripping from his wings dripping from his beak dripping from his tow [Applause] one bird pays the price the other bird gets loosed can you imagine that leper former leper amen he would look up at that bird flying across that field and he would realize it's because of the blood do you realize I'm free because of the blood of another outside the camp our Lord was sacrificed and that blood opened up a doorway it made a way because of his right hand listen to me that blood that we have received I'm not just talking about a covering I'm not just talking about being covered by The Blood come on but I want to tell you that's Church age mentality Luther preached covered Wesley preached covered Pentecost taught covered but this message did not just preach covered preach with me somebody I don't want to do away with our old songs covered by the blood but I want to tell you needed more than just being covered we needed more than just a covering this message come oh my to give us the intricate details of what the blood has done to the soul of a man that has come under the blood of the Covenant it's giving him a new confession it's giving him a brand new identity God hiding himself simplic to the breach if I got a red spot on my hand and I cover it with white the red spot's still there is it not well brother I can't see it that don't mean it ain't there come on I said the flesh has a way of covering things up people's got a way of covering things up we can look righteous we can dress righteous we can have long hair we can all have necklaces and earrings and all that but I want to tell you it's got to be more than just a covering it's got to be more than just putting it on on the outside young lady it's got to be more than a long dress there must be more than just a cover there must be a working of that blood inside of your heart Hallelujah that changes your very nature I got red spot on my hand and covered why red spot's still there it's still there but God sent down from heaven a bleach so from the very Heart Of God he sends down a bleach for sin it was the blood of his own son that when our confessed sins drops into God's bleach not just cover it try to find it again listen what he says watch this past Church age mentality the coloring of sin goes back through the mediators down through the time until it hits the accuser Satan and it lays on him till the day of judgment Luther never preached that Wesley never preached that Asuza never preached that but under the son of man Ministry Son of God son of man under the son of man Ministry think about he's letting us know what the power of the blood has done that it's taken your sin and it takes it away from you and it puts it back on your accuser and it lays on him the blood does not just cover sins it literally changes the molecular structure it changes the molecule it changes the fragments and it gets laid back upon the Devil and Satan will pay for the origination of the law that caused the fall in the beginning but brother what you don't understand is I did this and I did that and I ask you what are you talking about how many times do we tell God the Lord I know I did this and Lord I did that and whenever you confess that sin and put it in the bleach of his blood it leaves the very Mind Of God sin that's been confessed don't belong to you no more that was the leper that died it's not yours it's your adversaries and it it's put back upon him listen for it is imperative that we catch this today you must recognize listen to me you must recognize what the blood's done for you if you don't Satan will run you around the stump he'll beat you over the head with your feelings he'll show you every mistake if you don't have a revelation of the blood I want to tell you you're missing a real piece of [Applause] God and if you know what the blood does when Satan brings it up you can say what are you talking about Brother David I feel like a HP no I'm not speaking from flesh I'm speaking from attribute son amen amen I'm not talking about that old leer that died that leper that lose I'm talking about a new identity by the blood that changed me and born me [Music] again it's not being hid in the blood but the blood is a bleach are you hearing me the blood is a bleach I hear Brother Ram say this and I thought it's the bleach of God's blood and I thought wonder what the definition of bleach even is so I thought I'd bring it today you see bleach is a chemical that literally changes the molecular structure of a stain I'm not sure how I'm going to act from this time on look at this bleach works by releasing oxygen molecules in a process called oxidation the oxygen molecules released by bleach break up the chemical wow it breaks up the chemical bonds of the chroma Force so what's what bleach does it produces es a process Hallelujah it produces a process by a chemical that literally breaks up the bonds the change chromophor molecules either reflect no color or color outside the visible spectrum hang on your chairs sunlight amen works like a bleach so if I'm getting this right if you lay in the presence of the sun long enough I said if you lay in the presence of the sun long enough it'll take every stain it'll take every FR chromophor it'll take every molecule because the sun works like a bleach what's the bride doing she's laying in the presence of the son and he's rening her to a place of maturity and literally dissects the very chromophor GL Hallelujah Glory I said Glory go ahead and preach to us brother [Applause] Webster under whing chemical bleaches work in one of two ways an oxidizing bleach it works by breaking the chemical bonds that make up the chromophor listen to this this changes the molecule into a different substance [Applause] I said it breaks it in a complete different substance it don't look the same it don't smell the same it don't ooze the same it don't walk the same it don't talk the same it don't confess the same it's a total different substance alog together go ahead and set the I'll preach I want to tell you that's what the blood can do for a man it can take you and change every bar that Satan M you with every molecule every fragment it can change you and release you into a total different substance a reducing bleach a reducing bleach works by converting I wonder what happened to you when you went to the altar you went there as an ugly nasty grass stain of the Earth but when you got up there was a conversion reducing bleach spots converting multiple sins I mean Bonds in the chroma for into single Bond so it goes from being many and it transfers them over into one can't make this up sunlight Hallelujah sunlight acts as a bleach through a process leading to similar results High Energy Services I mean photons feel like some of that energy is Flowing right now high energy photons of light often in violent in in and UltraViolet we may SPF to make sure we don't get burnt by this natural Sun but spiritually God don't want you put nothing between you and him listen friends we're not living the age of spiritual sunblock I said let it let it shine in the fullness of its power let it shine on me Let It Shine On My Face Let It Shine on my hands Let It Shine On My Life Let It Shine on my church Let It Shine everywhere we go we don't want no spiritual Su we want to let the light shine on us high energy photons of light often in the Violet in the ultraviolet range it can disrupt the bonds in the chromophor don't Satan hate when that happens he's got a trick and a trap lay right for you and about the time you're going to step into it he's going to pull it right out of underneath your feet and he's walking through there about that time the light hits you and you walk right over it listen what he does it literally changes you it disrupts the bonds and the chrom for rendering the resulting substance rendering you colorless everybody buckle up make sure you got your fix it in in here's my last announcement today extended exposure of the sun often leads to massive discoloration reducing the colors to white though your sins be a Scarlet though your sins be a Scarlet they shall be they shall be they shall be white as snow [Applause] [Music]
