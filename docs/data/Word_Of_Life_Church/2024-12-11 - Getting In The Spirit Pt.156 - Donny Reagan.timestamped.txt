[41:11] desire spiritual gifts Desiring
[41:14] spiritual gifts and seeking spiritual
[41:17] gifts is not the same
[41:20] thing so follow after charity and
[41:25] desire spiritually
[41:27] gifts but
[41:29] rather rather that you may
[41:33] prophesy for he that speaketh in an
[41:35] unknown tongue speaketh not unto men but
[41:39] unto God for no man understandeth him
[41:42] how be it in the spirit he speaketh
[41:47] Mysteries but he that
[41:49] prophesizes speaketh unto men to
[41:53] edification and exhortation and Comfort
[41:58] he that speaketh in an unknown tongue
[42:01] edifieth
[42:03] himself but he that
[42:06] prophesies edifies the church now this
[42:09] is the way we can judge true prophecy if
[42:13] it edifies benefits makes the church
[42:18] grow so if it's called prophecy and it
[42:21] brings confusion if it's called prophecy
[42:25] and it doesn't happen if it's called
[42:27] prophecy and it doesn't tell an
[42:30] individual something or a church
[42:32] something that they need to hear it does
[42:35] not meet the scriptural identification
[42:39] or meaning of
[42:42] Prophecy he that speaketh in an unknown
[42:44] tongue edifieth himself but he that
[42:49] prophesizes
[42:50] edifieth the church so it doesn't
[42:53] confuse the church doesn't leave the
[42:56] church and tumult nobody's edified by
[43:00] confusion nobody is edified by tumult or
[43:04] things that are swn and Discord that's
[43:08] what we want is it with all of our
[43:09] hearts if every one of us would set our
[43:12] goal and our purpose in life to be able
[43:14] to edify the church edify our families
[43:19] edify the things that God puts in our
[43:22] path you'll find you're not very far
[43:25] away from being a a complete and mature
[43:29] son and daughter of God it's not going
[43:32] to be how much you know up here it's how
[43:34] much you've got down here and how much
[43:37] you can be able to reflect that through
[43:39] from here out to what you know here and
[43:43] express it right here with these hands
[43:45] and your Deeds I me desire that to be
[43:48] that way in your life tonight I me like
[43:51] to be remembered as we pray God bless
[43:52] you I'm sure there's many needs Among Us
[43:54] you know there's a lot of things that
[43:55] are going on of course folks lives but
[43:58] we believe our God is a mighty God he's
[44:01] a Healer he's a miracle worker is that
[44:03] right so let's just take these needs and
[44:05] requests before him tonight father we
[44:08] count it such a great honor to be
[44:09] together once again Lord in this house
[44:11] that's been dedicated to you Lord Jesus
[44:14] we don't know how many more times will
[44:16] we be able to meet here and no doubt
[44:19] father some of us if we realize how
[44:21] close we were to death's door we would
[44:23] sing more sincerely we would clap our
[44:26] hands more sinc sincerely if we realize
[44:29] how few our days would be upon the Earth
[44:32] um I imagine most of us would live every
[44:34] day in a more consecrated way so I
[44:38] really don't know how many more days
[44:39] I've got so I figure the best way for me
[44:41] to do is live every day as if though it
[44:44] were my last I would rather live that
[44:47] way than have regrets at the end of my
[44:50] life and think well I could have done
[44:51] better here and I could have done more
[44:53] there help me Lord that I can live the
[44:55] best that I can every day of my life no
[44:59] doubt I will never get all accomplished
[45:02] that I think needs to be but I've become
[45:06] an old man now and I've realized it's
[45:08] not really important if it's
[45:11] accomplished the way I think it is but
[45:13] what's important is I do what you want
[45:16] me to do so I pray that you'd help each
[45:18] of us tonight father lead us by your
[45:21] spirit direct us through the word
[45:22] tonight Lord we ask in the name of Jesus
[45:26] and the Saints said amen amen God bless
[45:28] you you may be seated what a great
[45:31] privilege it is for us to be part of the
[45:33] body of Christ and to be in our place
[45:37] and uh I understand that brother Tim
[45:39] Bret went a little bit along the lines
[45:41] about everybody was called for a certain
[45:43] place and certain position to be able to
[45:45] be fulfilled we know before the Rapture
[45:48] can actually take place every member of
[45:50] the body of Christ must be in their
[45:52] position now remember there's two parts
[45:54] of this the mystical part
[45:57] and then the church local the mystical
[46:00] part has never hurt anybody the mystical
[46:02] Body of Christ is not the one that you
[46:05] and I have any issues with the mystical
[46:07] part is never the one that you're GI
[46:09] ever getting an argument with because
[46:11] every person that's born into the
[46:13] mystical part every one of them's got
[46:15] the Holy Ghost every one of them is born
[46:17] by the Breath of God so therefore
[46:19] there's nothing in them that clashes but
[46:22] it's those that we go to church with in
[46:24] the local assembly that's the ones that
[46:27] caus US problems that's the ones that we
[46:29] differ with and the ones that we don't
[46:30] like this and we don't like the way they
[46:32] do that and that we don't like something
[46:34] else and a lot of folks you know they
[46:36] think well I'm in the mystical part I'm
[46:38] in Christ so I really don't even need to
[46:41] attend a church but yet we know
[46:43] according to the scripture that the
[46:45] first people that were baptized into the
[46:47] mystical part they went to the Natural
[46:50] part as well because it's part of our
[46:53] assignment that we're given in this life
[46:55] it's part of our heritage actually and
[46:57] our responsibility and we know that the
[47:00] New Testament Church was typified in
[47:02] many different shadows and types and one
[47:04] the one of the wonderful things that I
[47:06] love about it is that God took the
[47:09] Natural Things of life as I was studying
[47:11] about it while I was gone for a few days
[47:13] hunting with some of the brothers and
[47:15] bringing in the work of redemption and
[47:17] how many of the natural things as I got
[47:19] to looking at it in botney life animal
[47:22] life blood type all those different
[47:24] things that God brought in the act of
[47:26] redemption and how many things from the
[47:28] earth that God actually Incorporated to
[47:31] sacrifice Fellowship worship and
[47:33] atonement maybe I could speak to you
[47:35] about it but Paul was the first one to
[47:38] be able to be able to really catch a
[47:40] full understanding the Lord Jesus of
[47:43] course opened it up and mentioned first
[47:45] about it but Paul was the one that God
[47:48] opened up the real understanding in the
[47:50] New Testament about what it was to be a
[47:53] part of the body in so much that Paul
[47:56] was would tell us in the book of
[47:57] Corinthians that the eye could not say
[48:00] to the hand or the hand to the eye or
[48:02] the foot you know well because I'm not
[48:05] the eye I'm not really that important
[48:07] nobody else in the New Testament ever
[48:09] quite dealt with the body of Christ in
[48:11] that way so we know that the body then
[48:14] is likened to the natural human body and
[48:18] then whenever we look at the human body
[48:20] we know there's certain parts of our
[48:22] human body that are absolutely essential
[48:25] for Life there certain things you could
[48:28] do without there's probably people here
[48:30] tonight that no longer have an appendix
[48:33] you maybe no longer have your full
[48:35] thyroid that you were born with or maybe
[48:37] you've only got one kidney maybe you've
[48:39] only got one this and half of that and a
[48:41] quarter of this and something else and
[48:44] there's certain parts of the body that
[48:45] God in his grace knew that people would
[48:48] actually have removed from their body
[48:51] but they'd still be able to live but yet
[48:53] there's other parts of your body that
[48:56] you absolutely abolutely cannnot
[48:57] function without God never gave us two
[49:00] hearts he never gave us two brains he
[49:03] never gave us two parts of certain
[49:05] things that's absolutely essential for
[49:07] us to live and we can look in the
[49:10] mystical body and realize that there
[49:12] might be 10,000 instructors as Paul said
[49:17] yet you have not many fathers so there
[49:20] might be all types of preachers in the
[49:23] body but not every preacher is a father
[49:28] because he don't have the power to beet
[49:31] every preacher is not a starter of the
[49:34] works of God but some preachers only
[49:37] come in after starters start the work of
[49:41] God every preacher is not a starter
[49:44] every preacher is not a finalizer that
[49:48] brings the body to the place of
[49:51] completion now we know that God sends
[49:54] prophets and he chops his people out
[49:58] with His prophets so prophets are the
[50:00] ones that are going to be the major Hing
[50:03] piece in every day and then God will
[50:05] send other aspects of the ministry and
[50:08] they will do the work some will be
[50:10] called to focus a lot on the Divine
[50:13] Healing part in the body others will be
[50:16] called to teach and they will help bring
[50:19] the element of the body into a place of
[50:22] their position to be able to help them
[50:24] see who they are what they are
[50:27] that they need to better themsel in a
[50:29] closer walk with God every man's called
[50:31] for a different spot but yet prophets
[50:34] have a special Insight even in dealing
[50:37] with the body now I love the way that
[50:39] brother brandham deals with this aspect
[50:42] of the body and Christ reveal in his own
[50:44] word which was preached in 8:22 the
[50:46] morning service in
[50:48] 1965 and he said we see down through the
[50:51] age we started all from the foundation
[50:54] through the first church age when the
[50:56] seed went in the ground the complete
[51:00] seed now what went in the ground the
[51:03] complete seed which was in Alpha form
[51:07] God did not seow an impartial seed in
[51:11] the first church age but it was the
[51:13] complete seed when in the ground the
[51:16] complete seed that it come out through
[51:19] the feet in Luther now you got to be
[51:23] careful in types because now where
[51:26] having a human body which also parallels
[51:30] to a pyramid which is another type yet
[51:34] the pyramid does not start with Luther
[51:38] it starts with Paul now when you're
[51:41] running types if you're not careful if
[51:44] you try to run this type over in this
[51:46] type you'll get it all mixed up now
[51:49] watch the bottom of the pyramid did not
[51:52] start with Luther it started with the
[51:55] first church you with me so far but when
[51:58] we're talking about the
[52:00] restoration of the Bride tree it did not
[52:04] start with Paul because Paul under the
[52:08] administration of the anointing of the
[52:11] lion which was the Lamb's own personal
[52:14] life it was not a restored bride it was
[52:18] a whole bride but when you're looking at
[52:21] a restored bride we have a separate type
[52:25] and the analogy is not the same as it
[52:28] was in the pyramid so the pyramid
[52:31] started on the bottom foundation with
[52:33] faith First Church age messenger Paul
[52:36] but when we're looking at a restored
[52:39] bride back to the image and the
[52:41] Perfection of the son of man then it is
[52:44] the image oh she comes into the pyramid
[52:47] truly but when she comes into the image
[52:51] of a man then it does not start with
[52:54] Paul but it starts with Luther in the
[52:57] feet now watch he says it then it come
[53:01] through the feet Luther it come back
[53:05] then through Wesley then into the
[53:09] Pentecostals the tongues now watch what
[53:12] we do we move from Luther the feet and
[53:16] then we move from Luther on up into the
[53:19] stage of wesy which was a great portion
[53:22] of the body which was Whitfield Wesley
[53:25] John
[53:27] many of those men through that era so we
[53:29] come from the foundation part then we
[53:31] come up here then we move into Pentecost
[53:35] and what was Pentecostals type in the
[53:39] body it was the
[53:42] tongues yes the tongues the mouth they
[53:47] knew how to run their mouths but there
[53:50] was also a spiritual part now watch then
[53:53] into the Pentecostals the tongues in the
[53:59] lips now watch we're talking about the
[54:02] image of a man the restored image of the
[54:06] brid tree or you say brother Donnie make
[54:08] up your mind is it a man or is it a
[54:11] woman it's boast it's the restored image
[54:16] of Christ in his bride it will be that
[54:20] that will cause the resurrection now
[54:23] this couldn't happen in Luther Wesley or
[54:26] p Pentecost now watch he said then to
[54:29] bring back through Wesley then in the
[54:31] Pentecostals the tongues in the lips now
[54:36] it's in the eyes now watch now it's in
[54:41] the eyes prophetic of Malachi 4 and so
[54:46] forth now there's nothing else left for
[54:49] it to come but him himself to step into
[54:53] that CU that's the last thing there is
[54:55] now watch the last move before the body
[54:59] Chang the next is the
[55:03] intelligence the
[55:06] intelligence Now isn't it amazing that
[55:09] here we are by
[55:11] science and one of the great innovations
[55:15] that science has broke into and I you
[55:19] see it everywhere you're dealing with it
[55:21] every day and don't even know it and
[55:23] it's called artificial
[55:26] intelligence or
[55:28] AI now watch man has come to a spot to
[55:33] where in the scientific age that his
[55:37] focus is on intelligence artificial
[55:41] intelligence Israel has been using it
[55:44] for quite some time to help fight this
[55:46] war over in Hamas and Hezbollah by using
[55:51] artificial intelligence they are
[55:54] starting to do surgeries actually
[55:58] starting to diagnose people with
[56:01] diseases and sicknesses with artificial
[56:06] intelligence now the other day before I
[56:08] went on my hunting trip brother Ron
[56:10] Spencer brother Tim and I were texting
[56:12] back and forth and I told him I was
[56:14] going to be gone for a couple of days
[56:15] and brother Ron said send me some photos
[56:19] so this is a text now so I get this text
[56:23] and I pick up my phone to say okay I
[56:25] sure will but before I could actually
[56:30] type out the answer myself I just
[56:32] updated my phone and my phone through AI
[56:37] asked me if I wanted to send Ron Spencer
[56:41] a
[56:43] photo now before I could even pick it up
[56:46] to answer it AI now I did a search today
[56:51] on a few things and you probably done it
[56:53] yourself and the first one that came up
[56:56] was AI generated artificial intelligence
[57:00] brother Larry Elliott sent me one some
[57:02] time ago and he asked artificial
[57:06] intelligence to write a song about
[57:09] William brandham and it was absolutely
[57:12] incredible brother William Smith sent me
[57:14] another one that he done about brother
[57:17] Joel and sister Jennifer Hara on the
[57:21] basis of Esther of the Old Testament
[57:25] except brother will went a little bit
[57:27] farther than brother Larry did and that
[57:29] was that he asked for a program that it
[57:31] would be someone to sing it you should
[57:34] have heard this song it was absolutely
[57:38] incredible so it talked talked about Joe
[57:41] and Jennifer and how they read their
[57:43] Bible and how they pray and all this and
[57:45] that wonderful just beautiful and this
[57:48] beautiful human voice which was created
[57:51] by AI to be able to sing this song then
[57:55] someone else also sent me something that
[57:58] they had generated and it was a
[58:00] consensus of the message Christ The
[58:03] Mystery of God revealed and artificial
[58:06] intelligence went in in a matter of
[58:08] seconds and put out a consensus of the
[58:12] message that brother Brandon preached
[58:14] and of course it was pressage because
[58:16] that's what these people were doing and
[58:18] it was so good I almost brought it to
[58:20] church and preached it to you all I mean
[58:23] I thought wow this is absolutely
[58:26] incredible and yet there's not there's
[58:29] not a human with skin on it but it's
[58:33] actually humans that have brought this
[58:37] together to make it you follow me that's
[58:39] M making this ability to do that now to
[58:43] me there's also a scary side of that so
[58:47] what what could artificial intelligence
[58:50] do if it goes to turning on us human
[58:53] beings but look at where they are so
[58:57] they are at the state that artificial
[59:00] intelligence is going to start helping
[59:02] doctors it's going to start helping
[59:04] perform surgeries and do all sorts of
[59:07] things chap GPT and so many things that
[59:10] you're familiar with and yet it's
[59:12] constantly there even for our children
[59:15] going to school how are their teachers
[59:18] going to be able to know whether they
[59:21] are answering their homework theirself
[59:24] or AI is doing it for them a famous
[59:29] country music singer lost his voice not
[59:32] long ago because he had a a medical
[59:36] condition that affected him and he was
[59:38] told by doctors he would never be able
[59:41] to sing again but yet it was his desire
[59:45] to make at least one more song If
[59:47] possible so these people got together
[59:50] and they begin to talk to him and his
[59:52] wife and his manager and tell him hey
[59:54] you know what through AI we believe
[59:56] there's something we can do so someone
[59:59] wrote this certain song and sent it to
[1:00:01] him and you know he motioned and wrote
[1:00:03] he could write down a little bit and
[1:00:05] tell them that's the one I'd like to do
[1:00:07] it so they had another country music
[1:00:09] singer to come and actually laid down a
[1:00:12] soundtrack and then they fed this
[1:00:15] artificial intelligence this man's voice
[1:00:18] that he had sung for years and years and
[1:00:20] years and then let him get the tempo the
[1:00:23] Rhythm the intro the musicians all this
[1:00:26] and that and the other and then through
[1:00:28] run it all of that through artificial
[1:00:30] intelligence and when they got done with
[1:00:33] it here was this country music singer
[1:00:36] which could no longer
[1:00:39] sing but he was singing
[1:00:43] again now if man can do that through
[1:00:47] machines what if the voice of God had
[1:00:52] been stifled and held down by organiz
[1:00:56] ational systems and man-made ideas for
[1:01:00] hundreds and hundreds of
[1:01:02] years but the intelligence not
[1:01:05] artificial but the real intelligence of
[1:01:09] Christ himself was so step into his body
[1:01:15] that they in the last days will call for
[1:01:18] the resurrection amen and it will not be
[1:01:21] just their voice screaming and hollering
[1:01:24] or speaking low or mediocre whatever but
[1:01:27] it will actually be the voice of God
[1:01:31] himself and where did the prophet tell
[1:01:33] us in the church AG book the voice of
[1:01:35] God in the last days would be where it
[1:01:38] would be in the bride is that right and
[1:01:41] it it's not we're not looking for some
[1:01:43] Eighth Day messenger for some other
[1:01:45] Prophet to rise on the scene and tell us
[1:01:47] what brother Brenham did not say or pick
[1:01:49] up more brother Brandon left all we
[1:01:51] don't believe in any such nonsense at
[1:01:53] this church is that right but what if
[1:01:56] God would take that message which has
[1:01:59] already been preached and make it so
[1:02:01] real through us that we live that word
[1:02:04] we talk that word and it brings us to
[1:02:07] that place of completion and Perfection
[1:02:10] to where that the intelligence now if we
[1:02:13] are at that spot right up here now that
[1:02:17] does not mean whenever the eyes was here
[1:02:20] there was no more lips or there was no
[1:02:22] more tongues because those eyes told us
[1:02:27] there should always be a gift of
[1:02:29] speaking in tongues in the church is
[1:02:32] that right so now remember when we're
[1:02:34] coming up the body it does no longer
[1:02:36] mean that the body no longer has feet we
[1:02:39] still have action in the body we have
[1:02:42] legs we have all of that in the body but
[1:02:45] we are not going backwards and downwards
[1:02:49] to make the emphasis of our day the feet
[1:02:54] we're not making the emphasis of our day
[1:02:56] the thighs or the upper torso no no we
[1:03:00] are not nor are we making the emphasis
[1:03:04] of our day the mouth the tongues come on
[1:03:09] somebody we that is not our emphasis yes
[1:03:13] it is part but it is only part as a
[1:03:17] matter of fact the prophet said speaking
[1:03:18] in tongues is the least of the gifts
[1:03:21] well why in the world would we want a
[1:03:22] major on a minor then but do we need
[1:03:26] them you answer me do you all believe in
[1:03:28] speaking in tongues y'all believe in
[1:03:31] Prophecy come on so they can hear you on
[1:03:33] the internet y'all believe in the
[1:03:35] Supernatural you believe in signs
[1:03:37] wonders Miracles all of that yes but
[1:03:41] what is going to be the bride's main
[1:03:43] emphasis it's not just healing it's not
[1:03:46] just Miracles it's not just speaking in
[1:03:48] tongues it's all of that it's that plus
[1:03:53] praise the lord we believe the whole
[1:03:56] word so we believe in adoption we
[1:04:00] believe in the Supernatural we believe
[1:04:03] in the great manifestation of God God
[1:04:05] knows we need it like never before do we
[1:04:09] not now notice where the Prophet then
[1:04:12] places us that we are up now watch he
[1:04:16] said so the next is the intelligence and
[1:04:19] we have no intelligence of our own it's
[1:04:23] his we have no s height of our own how
[1:04:27] can a man foresee those things he can't
[1:04:31] do it it's God himself see it's becoming
[1:04:33] to a place and he's governed the body
[1:04:36] all the way through and then the
[1:04:39] complete body of Christ is revealed in
[1:04:42] the form of a bride notice masculine and
[1:04:45] feminist feminist is the flesh
[1:04:49] masculinity is the deity of God himself
[1:04:53] so it's God living in a ride on the
[1:04:56] earth in the last days which will become
[1:05:00] his
[1:05:02] mouthpiece so it's not that she has her
[1:05:05] own intelligence we're dumb and
[1:05:07] everybody said go ahead and say it about
[1:05:10] yourself I'm a dummy say it with me I'm
[1:05:13] a dummy no you're not saying that I am
[1:05:15] you're saying that you are I am a dummy
[1:05:17] we are dummies we without God we don't
[1:05:19] know anything come on somebody we didn't
[1:05:22] know how many gods there were we didn't
[1:05:24] know how to get saved we in the heart
[1:05:26] had to do nothing right but God by his
[1:05:28] grace allowed us to find it doubt then
[1:05:31] God wants to drop the intelligence what
[1:05:33] would it be a favor believer in our
[1:05:35] church had this dropping of the portion
[1:05:38] of intelligence of God in your life I
[1:05:42] wonder how many of the mistakes and
[1:05:44] things that we make because of the lack
[1:05:47] of leadership will disappear before we
[1:05:50] leave this
[1:05:52] place why because we are LED of the
[1:05:56] spirit of
[1:05:58] God listen to this then the complete
[1:06:02] body of Christ is reveal in the form of
[1:06:06] a bride that was taken out of his side
[1:06:10] like Adam did at the beginning like
[1:06:13] Adams was rather at the beginning so
[1:06:15] then a after we have arrived now right
[1:06:18] up here was where we were in Malachi 4
[1:06:21] the eyes this is why the prophet could
[1:06:23] see so there's no other eyes out of
[1:06:26] these eyes now I don't understand it but
[1:06:27] you know there's people in the message
[1:06:29] that have actually got another set of
[1:06:30] eyes up here and another set up there
[1:06:32] and another set up here and they've got
[1:06:34] all kinds of men that they're following
[1:06:36] and they're looking for this prophet and
[1:06:37] that Prophet I'll tell you one thing you
[1:06:39] have got some kind of weird looking body
[1:06:41] if you ask me you've got about six or
[1:06:44] six or eight different sets of eyes in
[1:06:46] that head you are some kind of deform we
[1:06:49] don't need no another set of eyes but
[1:06:52] what we need are people under the
[1:06:54] administration
[1:06:56] of the eyes to get under the influence
[1:06:59] of the Divine intelligence then what
[1:07:02] will it do well if artificial
[1:07:04] intelligence offered to help me send a
[1:07:07] picture to brother Ron Spencer and
[1:07:09] artificial intelligence help me today
[1:07:12] generate my search on Google and
[1:07:15] artificial intelligence it's already
[1:07:16] doing if you you just don't know it so
[1:07:18] don't be terrified and scared today as
[1:07:20] you've already been using it Siri and
[1:07:22] those types of things are very similar
[1:07:24] so when whatever it's there what's it
[1:07:26] for to help you well what do you think
[1:07:29] the intelligence of Christ is going to
[1:07:31] be in the body it's not to make you and
[1:07:33] I superheroes it's not to make us Mighty
[1:07:36] Man and Wonder Woman it's to help us to
[1:07:39] live the right kind of Godly life that
[1:07:42] we can absolutely defy hell every day
[1:07:46] that we are here don't think that it's
[1:07:48] going to turn us into a bunch of people
[1:07:51] that's going to start walking in every
[1:07:53] hospital and emptying them out Jesus
[1:07:55] didn't even do that and brother brenon
[1:07:57] didn't do it and we're sure not going to
[1:07:58] do it we're not going to start walking
[1:08:00] on these rivers and lakes and Creeks
[1:08:02] around here but I'll tell you what we
[1:08:04] will do we'll be so Godly that there'll
[1:08:07] be something generated out of our soul
[1:08:10] that people will be able to witness that
[1:08:13] there is a God that there is a God they
[1:08:16] may never believe your theology they may
[1:08:19] never understand your theology but they
[1:08:21] will not be able to get away from that
[1:08:24] aura which is around you which can only
[1:08:28] be brought to this stage when the body
[1:08:31] reaches this
[1:08:33] intelligence the feet are awesome oh my
[1:08:36] the legs the Torso it was awesome there
[1:08:39] was some great things that happened in
[1:08:41] Pentecost yes there were it was not all
[1:08:43] fanaticism it was not all flesh I saw
[1:08:46] many wonderful things happen in the
[1:08:49] dispensation of the mouths and the
[1:08:51] tongues but it was nothing compared to
[1:08:54] what happened in the eyes but remember
[1:08:57] there's nothing else that
[1:09:01] moves Beyond
[1:09:06] here so you can move your eyes up down
[1:09:10] sideways back and forth every way you
[1:09:13] want to move them around around I can't
[1:09:15] do mine that way I get sick but you can
[1:09:17] move them but your brain does not
[1:09:21] move now I saying we don't believe in
[1:09:23] Movement we do but that's not our main
[1:09:27] focus amen oh praise the Lord so then
[1:09:31] why would we as message people want to
[1:09:35] make the majority of our Focus back down
[1:09:40] in the
[1:09:44] mouth so you mean that's what we're
[1:09:46] focusing on just preaching more and more
[1:09:49] and more about the the three vocal gifts
[1:09:51] oh the gifts the gifts the gifts the
[1:09:53] gift and the gifts the gifts the gift
[1:09:54] why are we going
[1:09:56] backwards so you mean the next thing up
[1:09:59] according to the eyes was the
[1:10:03] intelligence and some of the Brethren
[1:10:05] are
[1:10:07] backtracking and you take the mouth
[1:10:10] preaching out of what they say oh my
[1:10:12] pretty sad I
[1:10:13] think notice again he says there's not
[1:10:17] one son in the morning and another son
[1:10:19] in the afternoon it's the same Sun same
[1:10:21] Sun that's in the afternoon is in the
[1:10:23] morning the same in the morning is in
[1:10:25] the afternoon now it said the day itself
[1:10:28] the day between that time will be kind
[1:10:30] of a like a dismal dark day it could not
[1:10:34] be called day or night never May he's
[1:10:35] quoting Zachariah in between that see
[1:10:38] that's the forming of the body from the
[1:10:42] feet coming
[1:10:44] up so I wonder how many people in here
[1:10:47] would know me by my
[1:10:53] feet my grandchildren probably
[1:10:56] wouldn't Carol
[1:10:59] might so how many would know you by your
[1:11:03] feet what about your legs we're decent
[1:11:06] people we keep them covered
[1:11:09] up so what are you known
[1:11:12] by
[1:11:14] face so your face is made up of what
[1:11:19] Pentecost Malachi 4 and Christ's
[1:11:23] intelligence amen so no matter what I
[1:11:26] would have on I mean oh my if You' have
[1:11:28] seen me last week and we was hunting in
[1:11:30] 13 degree weather and I had everything
[1:11:33] on the world about every s of clothes I
[1:11:34] had with me on to keep from freeing to
[1:11:37] death and you would have still
[1:11:38] recognized me though cuz there's one
[1:11:40] thing I didn't have covered up and that
[1:11:43] was my face I had ear muffs on my ears
[1:11:46] keeping from falling off Brother D but
[1:11:48] my face was still visible now you could
[1:11:51] have looked at my legs you would have
[1:11:53] not known me from the Abominable Snowman
[1:11:55] man you would have not known me from
[1:11:57] many of the other Hunters that were
[1:11:58] there you could have looked at my feet
[1:12:00] and saw that I had had on really nice
[1:12:02] warm boots and I had this and that in
[1:12:05] the other you still wouldn't have known
[1:12:07] who I was all right we're looking for
[1:12:08] brother Donnie we're trying to find
[1:12:10] brother Donnie I don't know that don't
[1:12:12] look like his feet I don't know what
[1:12:14] they look like well try to notify me by
[1:12:16] my knees look at my knees see if that
[1:12:19] separates look up here around my waist
[1:12:21] see if that separates me come on up
[1:12:24] around my chest so that where we look
[1:12:26] when we look at people we look at them
[1:12:29] in the face and the face is a relevance
[1:12:34] of where we are in the end time and you
[1:12:36] can see why that people can get so
[1:12:39] confused so easily because the distance
[1:12:43] from here to
[1:12:45] here is so
[1:12:51] close so close that it would deceive the
[1:12:54] very ele
[1:12:56] if
[1:12:57] possible look how close it is from your
[1:13:00] mouth to your eyes and then how close
[1:13:05] the eyes to the intelligence so what is
[1:13:09] it that controls the eyes your
[1:13:11] intelligence what controls the feet your
[1:13:14] intelligence your hands what all of that
[1:13:16] but yet the connection and the flow of
[1:13:19] divine energy has never been hallelujah
[1:13:23] what it's supposed to be the last day it
[1:13:26] wasn't in the feet it wasn't in the
[1:13:29] thighs in that way it wasn't even in
[1:13:32] Pentecost because the prophet said what
[1:13:34] seemed to be the outpouring of the Holy
[1:13:38] Ghost of that restoration it was not for
[1:13:41] just a few years it proved that many of
[1:13:44] them did not even have the Holy
[1:13:48] Ghost oh
[1:13:50] my so why friends why would we not want
[1:13:54] to keep
[1:13:56] going do we need
[1:13:58] feet do we need legs do we need
[1:14:01] tongues do we still need the eyes it's
[1:14:05] easy to see how some of the message
[1:14:07] people have that have turned to left
[1:14:09] from the message you know what when they
[1:14:10] do they're as blind as a bad I said
[1:14:13] they're as blind as a bad they're trying
[1:14:15] to grind to go straight into the
[1:14:17] intelligence of Christ and bypass the
[1:14:20] eyes which helps them read to comprehend
[1:14:23] the intelligence so they go straight
[1:14:25] from the mouth straight to the head
[1:14:27] straight from the lips straight up here
[1:14:30] straight from there straight up to I
[1:14:32] don't need them eyes if you're going to
[1:14:34] read you do if you're going to see the
[1:14:36] future I don't know I don't understand I
[1:14:40] cannot perceive Without Eyes the eyes
[1:14:44] told me this is what to look for this
[1:14:46] will be the signs the eyes told us that
[1:14:49] church aren't you glad the eyes soulless
[1:14:51] and then here we are right up here and
[1:14:54] it's processing processing where the
[1:14:58] Feet's going what the legs and the
[1:15:00] thighs did what the Torso did it's
[1:15:02] looking at Pentecost and processing and
[1:15:04] divining here's the True Vine here's the
[1:15:07] false Vine here's the twins in the last
[1:15:09] days what does that it's not your mouth
[1:15:12] that processes and discerns it's your
[1:15:20] intelligence oh Lord
[1:15:23] Jesus you see that's the forming of the
[1:15:25] body from the feet from the feet coming
[1:15:30] up when he was on Earth he was the Sun
[1:15:34] the
[1:15:36] likess the
[1:15:38] likess then he was killed the
[1:15:42] church took his
[1:15:46] place praise God the church took his
[1:15:51] place well it couldn't be said about the
[1:15:53] Catholic church that they've took his
[1:15:55] place it couldn't said be said about
[1:15:57] denomination not many of them that they
[1:15:59] took his place I don't even believe what
[1:16:00] he did they don't believe what he said
[1:16:02] many of them know is that right so they
[1:16:04] can't take his place so there's got to
[1:16:06] be a church in the last days that will
[1:16:09] take his place how can they take his
[1:16:11] place without his
[1:16:14] intelligence cuz I guarantee you there's
[1:16:16] going to be more to seit in this end
[1:16:18] time than there's ever been watch then
[1:16:21] he was killed the church took his place
[1:16:23] then martyred them went through the Dark
[1:16:25] Ages began to build on the foundation
[1:16:29] coming out then where does the sight
[1:16:32] come
[1:16:34] from at the top of the
[1:16:38] head then it started right back coming
[1:16:43] back the church come back from the feet
[1:16:46] coming up now it's in the head
[1:16:51] time head time
[1:16:55] now it's amazing because God sent the
[1:16:59] eyes while the lips were still
[1:17:03] talking and God let the eyes see back to
[1:17:06] the original word and he went around
[1:17:09] trying to tell the
[1:17:11] lips and the tongues y'all ain't
[1:17:15] operating this right you ain't doing
[1:17:18] right with it you're you're misusing
[1:17:20] them and and you're you're causing more
[1:17:22] of a stumbling block than you are a
[1:17:24] benefit
[1:17:25] F but did the lips take
[1:17:29] it did the tongues take it they said oh
[1:17:33] he don't know he was a
[1:17:35] Baptist he didn't understand being a
[1:17:39] Baptist or a Methodist or a heathen
[1:17:41] didn't make no difference it's the
[1:17:44] position that he
[1:17:46] held Oh Glory to God so are we then
[1:17:51] going back down this way
[1:17:56] and
[1:17:57] bypass the enlightenment that the eyes
[1:18:01] brought to what they had brother Jim you
[1:18:03] saw it as a young Pentecostal
[1:18:08] boy others here saw it as a Pentecostal
[1:18:11] and you'd see gifts that would hit right
[1:18:15] on and then other things they said was a
[1:18:18] million miles off thus sayith the Lord
[1:18:21] this and this and this a preacher text
[1:18:23] me the other day after the last
[1:18:24] Wednesday night service that I preached
[1:18:26] he said remember being a seven-year-old
[1:18:28] boy in a Pentecostal church and somebody
[1:18:30] was spoken in tongues and somebody got
[1:18:32] up and prophesying they started telling
[1:18:33] a big bunch of stuff and before they got
[1:18:36] done prophesying they wind up cussing
[1:18:39] right in
[1:18:42] church oh that'll never happen to us who
[1:18:44] say it won't happen to us if we don't
[1:18:46] judge our prophecy by what they eyes
[1:18:49] said instead of the
[1:18:52] mouth now watch oh oh my you can't
[1:18:57] see with your
[1:18:59] hands yet it's part of the body you see
[1:19:03] that's that's in in in every move it's
[1:19:05] been that way the hands work work work
[1:19:07] work work work work let's do this let's
[1:19:09] do that let's do that work work work
[1:19:11] work
[1:19:12] work but you see we're privileged in
[1:19:16] that we know how to send our hands to
[1:19:20] work through the direction of the
[1:19:23] eyes and their ages they didn't they did
[1:19:27] not know brother Harvey exactly how how
[1:19:29] do we do this how do we do that so
[1:19:30] they'd work and oh boy they'd do all
[1:19:32] this and they do all that oh praise God
[1:19:34] I'll tell you one thing I buy to the
[1:19:36] Widow some coal and I do this and the
[1:19:38] other oh that's
[1:19:39] good but the eyes told us the real
[1:19:43] meaning of
[1:19:45] compassion that compassion was not human
[1:19:48] sympathy but compassion is actually
[1:19:51] doing the will of God
[1:19:54] I don't know about you but I've let the
[1:19:56] devil play on my compassion many a time
[1:19:59] and help people out socalled and I
[1:20:02] wouldn't helping them at all I was
[1:20:04] actually making them
[1:20:05] worse well I didn't figure y'all like it
[1:20:08] but that's okay I got the doctrine of
[1:20:10] the eyes behind
[1:20:12] me that's what I'm want to judge
[1:20:14] everything I do don't you so the eyes
[1:20:18] told us that Jesus when he was on the
[1:20:20] earth he walked in amongst a multitude
[1:20:23] of people and went to a man that had a
[1:20:26] prostate trouble and it wasn't going to
[1:20:28] kill him he'd been that way for years
[1:20:30] and years he stepped over the lane the
[1:20:33] halt the blind the and went to
[1:20:36] one man and healed
[1:20:38] him why
[1:20:41] compassion now what would you have
[1:20:43] thought if you would have sat there that
[1:20:45] day and thought that Jesus had that
[1:20:47] power to heal maybe stepped over a
[1:20:50] little baby that was crippled another
[1:20:52] little child that was deformed another
[1:20:54] one that was mentally off and the Lord
[1:20:57] Jesus went to a man that was there he
[1:21:00] wasn't going to die of what he
[1:21:02] had he had no choice of doing that why
[1:21:06] he had compassion but we think human
[1:21:09] sympathy is compassion I never even knew
[1:21:12] what that really was until the eyes told
[1:21:17] me well I can tell look in some of
[1:21:19] y'all's faces y'all just found it out
[1:21:20] here tonight well good the eyes are
[1:21:22] still talking ain't they praise the Lord
[1:21:26] now watch you can't see with your hands
[1:21:29] yet it's part of the body you can't see
[1:21:32] with the ears yet it can hear you can't
[1:21:36] see with the nose yet it smells you
[1:21:40] can't you can't see with the
[1:21:43] lips though it
[1:21:46] speaks see that was
[1:21:51] the ah okay so they done a lot of
[1:21:56] talking but they just didn't see very
[1:22:00] far praise the Lord I can say that not
[1:22:04] only by theology but by
[1:22:07] experience oh yeah I've done a lot of
[1:22:08] running a lot of screaming a lot of Hing
[1:22:10] hey I've seen a lot of genuine Miracles
[1:22:12] at the same time I've seen absolutely
[1:22:14] phenomenal Miracles and I was as dumb as
[1:22:16] I don't know what when it come to the
[1:22:18] word why I didn't have no eyes I had a
[1:22:20] lot of hands to pray for the sick I
[1:22:22] anointed them with old I run up and down
[1:22:24] and shouted and screamed and holler I
[1:22:26] gave everything I had to my mouse
[1:22:29] Ministry praise the Lord I give
[1:22:32] everything I had to my tongue Ministry
[1:22:34] but boy I thank God I finally got some
[1:22:38] eyes I still talking tongues oh Lord God
[1:22:41] brother Donnie no oh Lord God yes I do I
[1:22:44] still I still have feet I've still got
[1:22:47] legs I've still got all of that but none
[1:22:50] of that is my emphasis and I am not
[1:22:54] going backwards and made the emphasis of
[1:22:57] this day the
[1:22:59] mouth the tongues the feet Luther Wesley
[1:23:04] I want to bring all of that up here and
[1:23:08] let it be connected to the
[1:23:10] intelligence and then the intelligence
[1:23:13] move the feet the intelligence move the
[1:23:18] hands praise
[1:23:20] God praise God
[1:23:25] you can't see with the lips though it
[1:23:28] speaks see that was the Pentecostal age
[1:23:31] but
[1:23:33] now it's in the eye
[1:23:37] time that the
[1:23:40] seeing now there isn't one
[1:23:43] moving
[1:23:46] faculty
[1:23:48] beyond the
[1:23:50] eye praise God
[1:23:55] the
[1:23:56] next is the
[1:23:59] intelligence which is Christ
[1:24:03] itself who
[1:24:06] controls the whole body so you can see
[1:24:09] why that people could make denominations
[1:24:12] do you understand there's a bride on the
[1:24:13] Earth today that absolutely cannot make
[1:24:17] an
[1:24:18] organization now there's people around
[1:24:20] this message that will and have but the
[1:24:23] bride cannot why because the
[1:24:26] intelligence of God will not allow her
[1:24:30] to do
[1:24:33] so so it's not just the eyes oh I can
[1:24:36] see I can see I can see the next thing
[1:24:38] is friends we don't want to stop just
[1:24:41] say oh brother Brandon was so wonderful
[1:24:43] yes he was he was a great servant of God
[1:24:45] a great prophet of God but I'm praying I
[1:24:48] hope you are for the very last thing in
[1:24:51] this body I'm not looking for brother
[1:24:53] brandom to come back oh yes he's raising
[1:24:55] in the resurrection but I'm not looking
[1:24:57] for a tent come on somebody I'm not
[1:25:00] looking no sir I'm not looking for him
[1:25:02] to have a private Resurrection never
[1:25:04] taught any such thing I am looking for
[1:25:08] the resurrection of the Dead not just
[1:25:10] one but all of those in Christ Jesus
[1:25:14] that's what I'm looking for and I will
[1:25:17] be changed how can me a 68 year old man
[1:25:22] go back to being 18 to 20 because the
[1:25:26] intelligence tells me
[1:25:31] to so the altar of eternal life living
[1:25:35] in my soul and stepped into my mystical
[1:25:39] part one day tells me Donnie
[1:25:44] become a young
[1:25:46] man and it will divinely charge me and
[1:25:50] run through my mortal body and all of a
[1:25:53] sudden all the scars and the beets and
[1:25:55] the bangs and the gray hair and this and
[1:25:56] that and the other that I've got and the
[1:25:58] wrinkles that I've got praise God they
[1:26:01] will be gone why because the Divine
[1:26:05] intelligence tells me so so we could
[1:26:08] have the feet we could have the hands we
[1:26:10] could have the lips we could have the
[1:26:12] tongues we can even have the mental
[1:26:15] aspect of the eyes but if we don't get
[1:26:18] the intelligence we won't go in the body
[1:26:22] change you see there's a mental facei to
[1:26:25] every one of these moves that was a
[1:26:28] mental facei to the feet a mental Faith
[1:26:31] to the knees and The Shins and all of
[1:26:33] that there was a mental Faith to the
[1:26:35] tongues and there is a mental faith I
[1:26:38] said oh yes I believe every word that
[1:26:40] Prophet said that's just words that's
[1:26:43] just words if you believe it you'll do
[1:26:45] it that's right you will do it and this
[1:26:48] message the eyes will lead you to the
[1:26:52] intelligence Christ I'm not here to
[1:26:54] worship brother brandham I'm not here to
[1:26:57] baptize in his name come on church we
[1:27:00] are not here to Rally around any man we
[1:27:03] are here to Worship the Lord Jesus we
[1:27:06] are here to magnify his name he's the
[1:27:09] Healer he's the Savior he's the
[1:27:11] deliverer he's the one we worship
[1:27:15] [Applause]
[1:27:20] tonight oh
[1:27:23] my the next is the intelligence which is
[1:27:26] Christ itself who controls the whole
[1:27:28] body no
[1:27:30] moving
[1:27:32] motion beyond that everything else has
[1:27:36] moved move your feet move your muscles
[1:27:39] in your legs move
[1:27:41] everything your ears can move your nose
[1:27:44] your lips and so
[1:27:46] forth but after your
[1:27:49] eyes there was
[1:27:51] nothing moves
[1:27:57] you know what it does takes human Works
[1:28:00] away from you and
[1:28:02] I makes us totally dependent upon Our
[1:28:06] Savior himself you can't beg you can't
[1:28:09] scream enough you can't beat the altar
[1:28:11] you can't cry you can't fast enough it's
[1:28:13] got to be the spirit of God in you now
[1:28:17] the mind that was in Christ Jesus is in
[1:28:19] every believer there is the soul
[1:28:27] souls in prison now now we find out on
[1:28:30] that part you see there is
[1:28:32] nothing beyond the eye every form every
[1:28:36] move every place in the body
[1:28:38] positionally shows us the very hour
[1:28:41] we're living
[1:28:43] in so just by looking at the spiritual
[1:28:47] anatomy of where we are right here
[1:28:50] friends right here not down here not not
[1:28:54] down here not down here can't you see
[1:28:57] and science has keeps on going going
[1:29:00] going and the sad part about it is
[1:29:02] religion is stale stale and stale so the
[1:29:07] lutherans are hundreds of years behind
[1:29:10] the methodists are hundreds of years
[1:29:11] behind the Pentecostals are many many
[1:29:14] years behind and it's sad to say but
[1:29:16] some of the people in the message are
[1:29:18] many many years behind they're waiting
[1:29:20] on brother B to come back oh that's when
[1:29:21] the Revival's coming Ain't nobody got
[1:29:23] the Holy Ghost Say say ain't nobody
[1:29:25] adopted Sons Ain't nobody got this we're
[1:29:27] all just kind of waiting hanging out for
[1:29:29] brother Bram to come that's an absolute
[1:29:30] Lie from the pits of Hell there's a
[1:29:33] bride on the face of the Earth the same
[1:29:34] has the same holy ghost that Peter had
[1:29:37] that Paul had on the day of Pentecost
[1:29:39] the same one brother Skip and they're
[1:29:41] doing the same works but this is part of
[1:29:44] the intelligence you see Paul had that
[1:29:46] when Paul said I wanted to go here I
[1:29:48] wanted to go there but the spirit
[1:29:50] wouldn't let me
[1:29:55] so you see it's not about you it's not
[1:29:56] even about your ministry or your gift
[1:29:59] it's not about you being promoted and
[1:30:01] you being something else it's about the
[1:30:05] intelligence and if he tells you no
[1:30:07] don't go here no don't do that oh but
[1:30:10] you see friends this is the scary
[1:30:13] part that there is a
[1:30:16] satanic
[1:30:18] artificial
[1:30:22] intelligence and it's very very
[1:30:25] spiritual that's why the prophet when he
[1:30:27] preaches Harvest Time F but listen that
[1:30:29] you need to that he said Satan can hand
[1:30:32] out them gifts Supernatural gifts by the
[1:30:39] handfuls and he said if you won't leave
[1:30:41] the word then he'll try to make you a
[1:30:45] supernatural offer he might let you
[1:30:48] speak in tongues he might let you
[1:30:51] prophesy he said even though it be a
[1:30:53] milon miles off the
[1:30:56] word
[1:30:57] ah but it's supernatural what is that a
[1:31:02] false
[1:31:03] artificial
[1:31:05] intelligence to try to move the body
[1:31:08] what was that thing in the Garden of
[1:31:10] Eden that got a hold of Eve it was
[1:31:12] another another intelligence instead of
[1:31:15] the spirit of God God knows in the day
[1:31:17] you eat there oh my that that you can't
[1:31:20] believe all that stuff God's trying to
[1:31:22] keep something from you don't you
[1:31:24] understand what the devil was doing
[1:31:25] tried to get her run ahead of the
[1:31:27] program of God she would have finally
[1:31:29] become a mother by the spoken word oh
[1:31:32] people to think of that how many brides
[1:31:34] revivals have we had through this
[1:31:36] message how many have come oh Lord
[1:31:39] hasten the day that the last one will
[1:31:42] arrive and the true bride will be
[1:31:44] waiting for the manifestation of that
[1:31:47] word a promise to live itself out of her
[1:31:50] life will there be healings yes there
[1:31:52] will not only healings Resurrection from
[1:31:55] the
[1:31:56] dead oh praise the Lord notice this
[1:32:01] every form every move every place in the
[1:32:04] body shows this position the very hour
[1:32:06] we're living in not another move can
[1:32:09] come above it there was a move of the
[1:32:12] hand charity Wesley there was a move of
[1:32:15] the foundation lucer charity never a
[1:32:18] greater it was called Wesley move they
[1:32:21] sent missionaries to all the world look
[1:32:23] qu a big move this was in the Wesley
[1:32:27] move look how big they went everywhere
[1:32:31] such
[1:32:32] love they sent missionaries all the
[1:32:34] world one of the greatest moves that was
[1:32:36] ever made in the age before then it come
[1:32:39] to the Pentecostal age then come in the
[1:32:41] different fingers and things the
[1:32:43] Pentecostal age of tongues and
[1:32:46] nose and so
[1:32:49] forth uh it's probably one of the
[1:32:51] reasons that some of the Pentecostal
[1:32:53] said
[1:32:54] I smell a demon here
[1:32:57] tonight uhhuh that's Pentecostal oh I
[1:33:01] know all those some of our message
[1:33:02] preachers say the same thing the prophet
[1:33:05] of God said you can't smell no demon I'm
[1:33:07] going to take the eyes what the eyes
[1:33:09] said instead of a flopping
[1:33:13] Mouse well praise the Lord I'll tell you
[1:33:15] one thing children the the problem is
[1:33:18] some of our
[1:33:19] Brethren are taking and bypassing the
[1:33:23] teach in of the
[1:33:25] eyes as if though he did not understand
[1:33:29] the
[1:33:31] mouth and the problem is because they
[1:33:34] actually think brother Brenham taught
[1:33:35] something different than Paul
[1:33:39] did woo I figured y'all be quiet tonight
[1:33:43] but I figured at least somebody say Amen
[1:33:44] or ouch or just wiggle your finger let
[1:33:46] me know you're with me or
[1:33:48] something now do we believe in the
[1:33:51] Supernatural gifts of God yes we do as a
[1:33:54] church notice now the gifts are actually
[1:33:57] sent to keep the church
[1:34:00] clean not to magnify this brother that
[1:34:04] speaks in tongues or this brother that
[1:34:06] interprets or this sister that would be
[1:34:08] able to prophesy it's not it's not about
[1:34:11] that it's to edify the body and the
[1:34:14] gifts are there to work in the church to
[1:34:16] keep the church clean notice this Wood
[1:34:20] River Illinois we just passed through
[1:34:22] there Monday night he said into the
[1:34:24] church Apostles prophets Gifts of
[1:34:26] tongues interpretation of tongues that's
[1:34:29] all for the edifying or keeping the
[1:34:33] keeping clean of the
[1:34:38] church okay so if we are truly seeing
[1:34:41] the gifts of
[1:34:44] God is there any house cleaning going
[1:34:48] on so in tongues interpretation and
[1:34:51] prophecy are going forth is to tell
[1:34:54] people to clean up this in their life
[1:34:55] and that in their life I'm not talking
[1:34:57] about generic now I'm talking about
[1:35:00] something that's so
[1:35:03] identifiable oh you say I saw it in
[1:35:05] Pentecost were preachers I don't know
[1:35:08] why but it's always been this way for
[1:35:09] years that preachers wanted to be above
[1:35:12] and beyond just the regular preacher guy
[1:35:15] you know you just go to church you study
[1:35:17] and you preach and you pray and you try
[1:35:19] to feed God's people and you try to live
[1:35:21] right and all that but there's been Aire
[1:35:23] are and many men that they wanted to be
[1:35:27] so
[1:35:28] Supernatural and so
[1:35:31] profound you know they just had to look
[1:35:34] at you really strange and make you feel
[1:35:36] really
[1:35:40] eerie they look at you very strange the
[1:35:43] next thing you know you know your hair
[1:35:44] standing up on the back of your neck you
[1:35:46] say Lord have mercy what in the world
[1:35:49] don't you think them men can't tell that
[1:35:51] don't you think they cannot tell when
[1:35:53] you get nervous they know enough about
[1:35:55] body language to see you are oh there's
[1:35:58] somebody here tonight that's got a need
[1:36:00] they've got this or that or the other
[1:36:06] baloney brother Tony be careful no you
[1:36:10] be
[1:36:12] careful cuz what I'm going to read to
[1:36:14] you is through the
[1:36:17] eyes I saw what the mouth does I
[1:36:21] experienced that I saw it heard what the
[1:36:24] lips do it just flat out bothers me
[1:36:28] friends that we see some of our brothers
[1:36:29] doing exactly the same thing as
[1:36:31] Pentecost and calling it The Bride move
[1:36:33] it ain't no bride move at this
[1:36:35] church if you folks want to vote me out
[1:36:38] that's fine if y'all getting tired of
[1:36:39] hearing me preach that's okay get you
[1:36:40] somebody else if that's what you want
[1:36:42] but as long as I'm here I'm going to
[1:36:43] tell you what these eyes said I'm
[1:36:45] leading you I'm trying my best to lead
[1:36:46] you up to this next stage of the
[1:36:48] intelligence why do we want to go back
[1:36:50] down to here and say oh this is it this
[1:36:52] is it this is it no this is not it we've
[1:36:55] done past that sure we bring it with us
[1:36:59] but that's not the emphasis of this hour
[1:37:03] I need help I need help and I'm not
[1:37:06] going to get it just from muttering in
[1:37:08] tongues and I believe in that I thank
[1:37:10] God I still speak in tongu but I need
[1:37:13] intelligence I need wisdom I need
[1:37:15] knowledge I need the leadership of the
[1:37:18] spirit of God I don't get it from my
[1:37:20] mouth
[1:37:25] notice again he said first as Apostles
[1:37:27] prophets teachers evangelists pastors
[1:37:30] those five god-given gifts in the church
[1:37:32] so each of your people who has a Godly
[1:37:34] Pastor has a gift from God in your
[1:37:37] church a Shepherd pastor means a
[1:37:40] Shepherd to watch over the flock to
[1:37:42] teach them the word of God then these
[1:37:44] other nine different spiritual gifts
[1:37:48] should be operating in the
[1:37:51] church amen
[1:37:54] but now
[1:37:56] remember here's the way it'll
[1:37:58] happen so the mouths opened and the
[1:38:02] tongue spoke and the lips framed the
[1:38:04] words under
[1:38:07] Pentecost much of what was said was not
[1:38:09] even the Lord it was impression it was
[1:38:13] thinking that's what the Lord
[1:38:15] said but God said I am not going to let
[1:38:18] this word of mine fall down and never be
[1:38:22] accomplished so I'm going to send the
[1:38:24] eyes and the eyes are going to retrain
[1:38:28] my
[1:38:29] bride and my bride they may not have the
[1:38:32] multitude that the lips has got but
[1:38:36] they'll be talking right thinking right
[1:38:37] singing right living right and flying
[1:38:42] light glory to
[1:38:44] God we're fixing to leave out of this
[1:38:46] place children now notice so God is
[1:38:50] going to bring all you say well he done
[1:38:52] away with all that you show me where the
[1:38:54] Bible says that he done away with all of
[1:38:56] that God's Prophet never taught that
[1:38:58] once we get up here in the intelligence
[1:39:00] and up in the eye we didn't need no
[1:39:02] Supernatural while a great portion of
[1:39:03] his ministry was based on Supernatural
[1:39:06] we still need
[1:39:09] Supernatural oh thank the Lord for it
[1:39:12] too then these other nine spiritual
[1:39:14] gifts should be operating in the church
[1:39:16] to keep the church
[1:39:18] clean amen
[1:39:21] ah then what does the eyes do the eyes
[1:39:25] goes to the bottom of the pyramid
[1:39:28] crosses over from the human anatomy type
[1:39:31] and goes over into the Mountain of God
[1:39:33] type and goes right down to the original
[1:39:36] foundation of the pyramid and pull from
[1:39:38] that original foundation in the book of
[1:39:42] Acts now this is what the gifts are
[1:39:45] supposed to do in the
[1:39:46] church keep the
[1:39:49] church perfected and clean my notice
[1:39:54] like
[1:39:56] ananas and
[1:39:58] Safara so when ananas wed up before
[1:40:01] Peter what' Peter say a
[1:40:05] brother
[1:40:07] now now uh you you've got a need
[1:40:11] now oh boy something man wow man well I
[1:40:16] don't understand people they just n fall
[1:40:17] out when somebody says something like
[1:40:19] come on a sinner could say
[1:40:22] that what did Peter tell him why did
[1:40:26] Satan put in your heart to lie to the
[1:40:28] Holy
[1:40:30] Ghost was not this proper to
[1:40:34] yours why did you and your wife make
[1:40:38] this deal
[1:40:40] look come on let's produce the gifts
[1:40:43] this way okay but much of it is said in
[1:40:46] such a way that you never really know if
[1:40:49] it comes to pass or not there's no dates
[1:40:52] there's no dead lines there's no this or
[1:40:54] that or the other it's so generic come
[1:40:56] on I know folks is going to get mad at
[1:40:58] me they're already mad at me already but
[1:41:00] that's all right the intelligence is
[1:41:02] Blessing
[1:41:03] Me praise the Lord you realize now that
[1:41:07] their God's Prophet ties it right back
[1:41:10] to the book of
[1:41:12] Acts the spirit of God rise up and call
[1:41:16] somebody out and tell them they're
[1:41:18] living wrong why to rebuke that sin
[1:41:21] openly
[1:41:23] brother sister you got something in your
[1:41:25] life so and so and so and so and you say
[1:41:28] good Lord we come back in here Sunday I
[1:41:30] mean I realize I may not been near as
[1:41:32] many of us
[1:41:35] but hey do we want God or do we want to
[1:41:39] play Church you tell
[1:41:41] me do we want God in reality do we want
[1:41:45] TR whether or not you want it ananas and
[1:41:48] Safara will return in the last days amen
[1:41:52] it's not just going to be men that are
[1:41:54] been magnified and I prayed for so and
[1:41:56] so and this happened if you haven't
[1:41:57] listened to thetive Spirit March of 1960
[1:42:00] I advise you listen to it and you hear
[1:42:02] the prophet of God talking about
[1:42:04] Discerning spirits on men and watching
[1:42:06] how they do with a Great Mighty gift and
[1:42:09] see if they try to use that gift to
[1:42:11] bring glory and honor to
[1:42:14] thems then he said you're not really
[1:42:16] judging that man but you're judging his
[1:42:18] attitude and his you know whatever that
[1:42:20] he's doing with that gift so you know
[1:42:22] what I'm I'm protected by the eyes to do
[1:42:25] such now watch he said that's what the
[1:42:28] holy spirit is in the church
[1:42:32] for to keep the church clean and
[1:42:36] ready for the coming of the
[1:42:38] Lord so for our churches around the
[1:42:40] message that have the gifts
[1:42:43] moving is that what it's
[1:42:48] doing testing one two3 test 112
[1:42:53] so is it telling brother Keith brother
[1:42:55] Keith you done this and this on Monday
[1:42:57] brother you should not have done that
[1:43:01] repent does it tell brother Rob brother
[1:43:04] rob you should not have said this to
[1:43:05] your wife sister Sarah just because she
[1:43:08] burnt your cornbread before church you
[1:43:10] had an awful attitude brother repent for
[1:43:14] that brother Rob and Sister Sarah look
[1:43:17] at each other and say he looks over
[1:43:19] honey I'm so sorry
[1:43:24] but does the modern message rendition
[1:43:26] make anybody repent and clean yeah the
[1:43:28] Lord say I'm here and now the Lord said
[1:43:30] I bless you all and how the Lord say I
[1:43:32] do this and how the Lord say i' do that
[1:43:35] and I said i' do this you're quoting
[1:43:37] scripture and the prophet said prophecy
[1:43:39] is not that way
[1:43:42] amen and the church
[1:43:46] said but you see the problem we're going
[1:43:50] back to the mouth and we're cons Consul
[1:43:53] in Mouse
[1:43:55] theology instead of Consulting our
[1:43:59] theology in order to use the mouse to
[1:44:03] bring it out the right way this is why
[1:44:05] Satan don't want it
[1:44:06] right this is why he wants us to accept
[1:44:11] a
[1:44:12] substitute that hits and
[1:44:17] misses listen friends there was things
[1:44:19] said about my daughter Erica that did
[1:44:22] not have happen and never will
[1:44:29] happen is it hurtful very is it
[1:44:33] disappointing
[1:44:35] very what's even more disappointing than
[1:44:38] something been said that's wrong but men
[1:44:40] without the
[1:44:42] guts to come to you and
[1:44:46] apologize and say I said something
[1:44:49] wrong please forgive me stand out before
[1:44:53] forever they preach that I'm so sorry I
[1:44:56] I I I I I said the Lord said that or or
[1:44:59] I told him that was the
[1:45:00] Lord come on don't get quiet Lord of
[1:45:03] Mercy if you get any quieter you a bunch
[1:45:04] of Egyptian
[1:45:08] mummies there were Supernatural
[1:45:11] occurrences
[1:45:13] socalled that happened that supposedly
[1:45:16] was supposed to be about my daughter
[1:45:18] that never happened and never will
[1:45:23] so we just let things
[1:45:32] go come on now now I made the offer here
[1:45:35] a few weeks ago everybody that's mad at
[1:45:36] me to get me a gift card there's only
[1:45:38] one person that done it and it was a
[1:45:40] preacher friend of mine he wasn't even
[1:45:41] mad at
[1:45:46] me look friends I saw gifts with hit
[1:45:50] Miss hit Miss hit Miss I'm not
[1:45:53] interested in hit Miss I'm interested in
[1:45:56] hit hit hit hit hit every time on
[1:46:09] target one more quote and I'll let you
[1:46:11] go now we said in the church to keep the
[1:46:14] church in line with the word what tapes
[1:46:18] tapes tapes tapes and more tapes
[1:46:25] you say a man who tapes that and says
[1:46:28] tapes is a
[1:46:31] liar and he don't believe what the Bible
[1:46:34] said nor what the prophet
[1:46:38] said keep on you're going to get me
[1:46:40] killed
[1:46:42] sir God sent men not man called God sent
[1:46:47] inspired men to keep the church lined up
[1:46:51] now what is it gifts of the spirit in
[1:46:53] the church not a bunch of fanaticism but
[1:46:56] truly gifts of the Spirit in the church
[1:46:58] that's right keeping the church if a
[1:47:00] real church is ordained of God really
[1:47:02] filled with the Holy Spirit if sin would
[1:47:05] appear in the
[1:47:07] church it would be another ananas and
[1:47:11] Safara okay so our churches look down on
[1:47:14] because we don't have tongues
[1:47:15] interpretation of Prophecy going on
[1:47:17] every service or every other
[1:47:19] service and we're not supposed to be
[1:47:21] spiritual but for the those who are
[1:47:23] operating it where is ananas and
[1:47:33] Safar if somebody had done something
[1:47:35] wrong the Holy Spirit rise right up and
[1:47:37] reveal it that have to clean
[1:47:41] up the gifts of the Spirit in the church
[1:47:44] oh God oh
[1:47:47] God send us a church like that
[1:47:53] now
[1:47:54] watch here's the eyes saying oh God send
[1:47:59] us a
[1:48:01] church like that not doing away with the
[1:48:04] mouth not doing away with the lips but
[1:48:08] Harry now we know how to judge it
[1:48:14] right why the gifts are put in the
[1:48:16] church to separate and take sin
[1:48:20] out to keep the church clean
[1:48:23] it's God's
[1:48:25] toxin that's given to the church also
[1:48:29] his
[1:48:32] disinfect wow so you mean gifts are like
[1:48:36] a
[1:48:37] disinfectant a spiritual
[1:48:39] LOL or a spiritual bleach you know or
[1:48:43] spiritual ammonia wo boy that stuff most
[1:48:46] of that stuff I just mentioned has got a
[1:48:48] terrible Aroma to it don't it and it'll
[1:48:51] burn your hands and you don't like
[1:48:53] smelling it come on somebody but that's
[1:48:56] what the real gifts are so the real
[1:48:59] gifts that put off this sweet adorable
[1:49:03] man worshiping
[1:49:07] Aroma you need some
[1:49:11] ammonia come on somebody you need to get

[1:49:26] that arrogance it'll kill that man
[1:49:28] worship it'll kill that idolatry of
[1:49:31] lifting men to a place that they
[1:49:33] shouldn't
[1:49:34] [Applause]
[1:49:36] be oh
[1:49:38] my let me tell you some friends I do not
[1:49:41] judge the word by a
[1:49:44] spirit I judge Spirits by the
[1:49:50] word let's stand pray praise the lord
[1:49:53] it's been good knowing y'all if I don't
[1:49:54] see you
[1:50:03] again I realize some of my brothers are
[1:50:06] taking clips from my sermons and passing
[1:50:09] them
[1:50:13] around that's
[1:50:15] okay as long as my voice is identified
[1:50:18] saying what the eyes said I have no
[1:50:21] problem with that
[1:50:23] now have any of you all heard me quote
[1:50:25] Donnie Reagan tonight as far as I know
[1:50:28] we have no Donnie Reagan quote books do
[1:50:30] we I mean I've never seen one myself so
[1:50:33] what was I reading to you tonight from
[1:50:36] the
[1:50:38] eyes let's go back down to the
[1:50:40] foundation of the pyramid 1 Corinthians
[1:50:44] 144 he that speaketh in an unknown
[1:50:48] tongue edifies himself but he that
[1:50:56] prophesy look at the meaning of the word
[1:50:58] speak forth by Divine
[1:51:00] interpretations to
[1:51:06] predict
[1:51:09] ah here's where it gets scary you see
[1:51:13] this is where when brother brandham and
[1:51:14] his own church corrected the people and
[1:51:17] went to Brother Neville and told him
[1:51:18] said brother Neville leave them alone
[1:51:20] they're babies we can't judge it now
[1:51:23] so he said when it come time to set it
[1:51:25] in order he said a lot of what they was
[1:51:26] saying never even come to pass in the
[1:51:28] brandham
[1:51:30] Tabernacle and whenever he set Church
[1:51:32] order in he said a big bunch of them
[1:51:36] left they pulled away from the teaching
[1:51:39] of the eyes and
[1:51:41] left
[1:51:44] Hallelujah and he said one man told him
[1:51:46] will you put us on the
[1:51:49] spot he said don't you think I'm on the
[1:51:52] spot when I stand before hundreds or
[1:51:54] thousands of people and tell them your
[1:51:56] name is so and so you went to a doctor
[1:51:59] yesterday and this and this but thus
[1:52:02] sayeth the Lord by next week this time
[1:52:04] you'll be made well right I tell you
[1:52:07] friends it's absolutely phenomenal how
[1:52:09] many Pentecostal people are putting out
[1:52:12] testimonies on YouTube I saw one not
[1:52:14] long ago of a man that went to Brother
[1:52:17] bram's meetings when he was a young boy
[1:52:19] and his father and mother was there and
[1:52:21] brother brandham called out a woman and
[1:52:23] they knew this woman and brother bandam
[1:52:26] called her out and told her said you
[1:52:27] live in streets so and so such and such
[1:52:29] and so and so and that man and woman
[1:52:32] looked at one another and said we know
[1:52:33] her that's not where she
[1:52:36] lives that's not where she lives and
[1:52:39] they said Oh Brother R and missed it
[1:52:40] brother R and missed
[1:52:42] it so they went to that woman after
[1:52:46] church but you see the thing of it was
[1:52:49] the Holy Ghost had already updated her
[1:52:52] address
[1:52:55] book but they didn't know it so they go
[1:52:59] to her and said oh sister you know
[1:53:00] brother R called you out and he he gave
[1:53:02] you the wrong address he said oh no
[1:53:04] brother sister I I just I just
[1:53:09] moved that's what I'm talking
[1:53:13] about amen
[1:53:16] hallelujah may God grant to
[1:53:20] us this
[1:53:24] to prophesy with the idea of foretelling
[1:53:28] future
[1:53:30] events pertaining
[1:53:33] especially to the kingdom of God to
[1:53:35] utter Force
[1:53:37] declare a
[1:53:39] thing which can only be
[1:53:43] known by
[1:53:45] divine
[1:53:49] revelation this is why it cannot be a
[1:53:51] repeating of script
[1:53:53] scriptures that's known by
[1:53:56] reading a real prophecy of God tells
[1:54:00] something that's not even in the in the
[1:54:03] written
[1:54:05] word you can see why there'll be few and
[1:54:09] far
[1:54:10] between but I'd rather have it three
[1:54:12] times a year or
[1:54:13] four operating the
[1:54:16] mouth from the intelligence down to the
[1:54:20] teaching of the eyes and then Focus this
[1:54:23] way instead of bypassing the eyes and
[1:54:26] coming straight to the mouth oh we don't
[1:54:28] believe in that old church or we don't
[1:54:30] believe that old church order be careful
[1:54:32] what you're
[1:54:33] saying that's not my terms that's the
[1:54:35] prophet's
[1:54:38] terms I want gifts too but this is the
[1:54:41] order I want them not from here
[1:54:44] out from here down through the teachings
[1:54:48] of the
[1:54:49] eyes and then it comes down this way so
[1:54:51] if one says say I'm an interpreter of
[1:54:53] tongues and this is the way we'll judge
[1:54:55] them all right brother sisters so do you
[1:54:57] hear them speaking in tongues in
[1:55:00] English well no I just feel led to say
[1:55:03] it then you don't have an
[1:55:05] interpretation cuz the eyes says that
[1:55:08] you hear it in your native language
[1:55:10] which you was born
[1:55:13] in but friends this is the
[1:55:16] problem some of the folks feel out
[1:55:18] brother brandom was not saying what Paul
[1:55:21] said
[1:55:24] I honestly don't know how you could
[1:55:25] follow a prophet like
[1:55:27] that so what else did he say that Paul
[1:55:31] didn't
[1:55:33] say but them folks that was carried
[1:55:35] beyond the curtain of
[1:55:37] time when he said will all leaders be
[1:55:40] judged he said
[1:55:42] yes well he said if Paul's people goes
[1:55:45] in mine will
[1:55:47] too cuz what Paul preached I preached
[1:55:53] millions of voices screamed
[1:55:55] out we are resting on
[1:56:00] that I'm going to say it tonight that's
[1:56:02] what I'm resting
[1:56:04] on if God's Prophet taught for us to do
[1:56:07] a certain thing do it this way and that
[1:56:09] way whether or not I even understand it
[1:56:13] I'm going to do
[1:56:15] it and if it comes down to opinions I'll
[1:56:19] even take his own opinion over my own
[1:56:22] yeah cuz he was eyes I'm just barely a
[1:56:25] cell stuck somewhere in the middle of
[1:56:27] the body come on children I don't do my
[1:56:31] opinion the way some preachers do and
[1:56:32] they exalt their opinion above the eyes
[1:56:35] that's pretty foolish if you ask
[1:56:37] me don't you love
[1:56:40] him don't you
[1:56:42] see the last false bride move whatever
[1:56:47] it is the last false so-called brid
[1:56:53] Revival when the last one strikes and
[1:56:57] hits just the other day I saw a message
[1:56:59] preacher clip that was sent to me said
[1:57:02] the end is
[1:57:04] tomorrow the Lord's coming
[1:57:07] tomorrow so y'all just forget everything
[1:57:09] cuz it's it's
[1:57:13] tomorrow then I got another clip a week
[1:57:16] later and he said the Lord has delayed
[1:57:20] is coming
[1:57:28] them hundreds of people ought to kicked
[1:57:30] him
[1:57:31] out but instead most of them would be
[1:57:34] right there screaming and
[1:57:37] hollering God have mercy on us children
[1:57:40] do you realize how many message people
[1:57:41] are going to be
[1:57:43] lost absolutely lost without
[1:57:47] God why they do not value this word
[1:57:53] they handle this word like it's a toy
[1:57:56] they handle this word like it's a
[1:58:00] Play-Doh and God's Prophet said three
[1:58:02] times in the Bible it was an
[1:58:05] unpardonable sin to add one word of your
[1:58:07] own interpretation to a message after
[1:58:10] you have been Vindicated to be the truth
[1:58:12] unpardonable
[1:58:15] sin there will be message people that
[1:58:18] will walk up to the white Throne
[1:58:20] convinced that they're going into heaven
[1:58:22] and the Lord Jesus will look at them and
[1:58:24] say depart from
[1:58:26] me I gave you
[1:58:28] eyes and you refused
[1:58:31] him may God help
[1:58:35] us one of the scariest categories in
[1:58:39] this message is
[1:58:43] preachers how many have we had that a
[1:58:46] walk before God as lost as a
[1:58:49] harlot as lost as a drun
[1:58:54] why because they exalted their own
[1:58:57] opinion above the eyes of Malachi
[1:59:03] 4 you see God allowed his Prophet to
[1:59:06] leave out certain things on purpose why
[1:59:09] did Jesus say father son Holy Ghost it
[1:59:12] was said on
[1:59:13] purpose why were many things left out
[1:59:16] even in the message left out on
[1:59:19] purpose so these mongr
[1:59:23] and Seed of the serpent would come
[1:59:27] around and say well he almost said it
[1:59:29] that's what he meant how can we say what
[1:59:31] he meant my Lord sometimes I don't even
[1:59:34] know what I mean I don't even know what
[1:59:36] you mean that's what a prophet
[1:59:39] meant but don't you understand God does
[1:59:41] it that
[1:59:42] way because it's a temptation to
[1:59:46] man it's a temptation to human beings to
[1:59:49] want to go ahead and say it just
[1:59:54] I just got to say go
[2:00:01] ahead but I want to say what's been
[2:00:07] spoken yep you know what you come back
[2:00:10] 20 years from now if I'm still alive
[2:00:11] then still preaching you know what
[2:00:13] you're going to hear me preaching the
[2:00:15] same message you heard 35 years ago when
[2:00:17] I was here some of the folks and I came
[2:00:19] here 30 some years ago they didn't like
[2:00:21] what I was preaching they've come back
[2:00:23] again I'm still preaching the same thing
[2:00:25] well they leave and come back again
[2:00:27] another 10 years if we're still here 10
[2:00:28] years you know what I'll be preaching
[2:00:30] same thing same thing they didn't
[2:00:31] believe 35 years ago same thing they
[2:00:33] didn't believe 25 years ago same thing
[2:00:35] they didn't believe last
[2:00:39] year so where does people with unbelief
[2:00:41] stand before
[2:00:43] God
[2:00:49] lost lost
[2:00:53] I sent you prophets and you killed
[2:00:57] them Prophet tells us about it in
[2:01:00] sort they said they do the same thing in
[2:01:02] every generation God will send them a
[2:01:04] prophet then about another generation
[2:01:08] they'll polish his tomb and make an idol
[2:01:12] out of his
[2:01:16] life make an
[2:01:18] idol out of his life we are not Amish we
[2:01:22] are not menites we're not following
[2:01:24] Joseph
[2:01:25] Menon we're not looking for another man
[2:01:27] to make our Idol brother BR never come
[2:01:30] to make us
[2:01:32] branhamites he come to make us Sons and
[2:01:34] Daughters of God to lead us back to a
[2:01:37] new birth that's what he tells us was
[2:01:39] the theme of his life in the church age
[2:01:40] book that men and women would have a
[2:01:42] closer walk with
[2:01:44] God except what the message has done for
[2:01:48] you don't you love the message I'll tell
[2:01:50] you one thing I love it now more than
[2:01:52] ever before we're under more persecution
[2:01:54] and I it's going all over the United
[2:01:56] States and newspapers and you know all
[2:01:59] kinds of newscasts and this and that and
[2:02:00] the other and it shows to me the devil
[2:02:02] is more scared of this message now than
[2:02:04] he was in 1965 he hates this message why
[2:02:07] ain't he doing that to the Bible why
[2:02:09] ain't he doing that to Martin Luther why
[2:02:11] ain't he doing that to Pentecost why
[2:02:12] this message is the Capstone it's the
[2:02:15] eyes you cannot get to the intelligence
[2:02:17] from the mouth up you got to have that
[2:02:20] Capstone right there on the next thing
[2:02:22] to the intelligence is the eyes
[2:02:25] itself forgive me if for going on long
[2:02:28] let let's pray
[2:02:31] together oh dear
[2:02:36] Jesus what an hour to be living
[2:02:41] Lord how I thank you for this
[2:02:46] message Lord God we
[2:02:48] want the word to be our absolute
[2:02:53] we want our church to be built upon that
[2:02:55] absolute of the
[2:02:58] word I thank you for some of the
[2:03:00] experiences I had in Pentecost because I
[2:03:03] found an element of reality there though
[2:03:06] it was mixed up with a lot of
[2:03:09] mess but Lord
[2:03:12] Jesus I'm so grateful that there was a
[2:03:14] deep down inside of me hungering for
[2:03:17] more I had Miracles I had tongues I had
[2:03:21] interpretation and I had
[2:03:23] prophecy so if that's all I needed then
[2:03:25] why did I ever need to come to the
[2:03:27] message why wasn't I happy why wasn't I
[2:03:33] satisfied why was it when I come across
[2:03:35] that Wolf Creek Dam that night and your
[2:03:38] presence filled that
[2:03:41] automobile and my hair was standing up
[2:03:43] on my arms and I was so under the
[2:03:45] presence of the Lord by myself in that
[2:03:47] car that I had to pull over just as I
[2:03:50] crossed the dam and I was afraid to even
[2:03:53] look sitting there with my eyes closed
[2:03:56] and my head bowed and I heard your voice
[2:03:59] in the back seat and it like just scared
[2:04:01] me to death
[2:04:02] Lord you remember the
[2:04:05] night I wasn't even following the
[2:04:07] message didn't believe it
[2:04:10] then but you spoke my destiny and you
[2:04:14] told me there was something greater
[2:04:16] right just ahead me and my mouth
[2:04:20] thinking I saw maybe more signs more
[2:04:25] wonders more gifts this that the other I
[2:04:28] didn't know exactly what it
[2:04:30] was but it was what I was ordained to
[2:04:33] walk in you
[2:04:34] said I didn't even believe in
[2:04:37] predestination I didn't even believe in
[2:04:39] ordination oh I could quote it from the
[2:04:41] Bible but I was quoting it from my
[2:04:44] mouth's
[2:04:46] understanding so the intelligence come
[2:04:49] back in the back seat of my car and
[2:04:51] spoke out my
[2:04:54] destiny oh
[2:04:56] Jesus oh
[2:04:59] Jesus help us
[2:05:01] Lord father I pray for every man woman
[2:05:04] boy and girl in this place
[2:05:07] tonight maybe Satan's wiring them out
[2:05:09] with their failures and their mistakes
[2:05:10] and their
[2:05:11] shortcomings but may the intelligence of
[2:05:15] Christ the Holy Ghost
[2:05:17] himself maybe they're back sting maybe
[2:05:20] they're in a cold State tonight
[2:05:22] Lord but may you speak from within
[2:05:25] themsel from within their soul and say
[2:05:28] daughter you are not called to be this
[2:05:32] but you're called to a higher
[2:05:34] call son you're called to a higher
[2:05:41] place oh God woo each
[2:05:44] heart each child of
[2:05:47] yours father I say to you tonight with
[2:05:50] all sincerity of my my
[2:05:54] heart these are the gifts I so
[2:05:58] desire I don't want hits misses
[2:06:02] flesh things not even said in such a way
[2:06:05] that it can be proven or
[2:06:08] disproved that if it's said the
[2:06:10] preachers take glory and if it's said in
[2:06:12] such a way that it seems that come to
[2:06:14] pass they take Glory but it's also said
[2:06:17] in such a way if it don't come to pass
[2:06:19] they never said thus sayeth the Lord so
[2:06:21] well I was just trying to encourage
[2:06:25] them and yet we as message people
[2:06:28] swallow it
[2:06:29] down it ain't no wonder the Rapture
[2:06:31] ain't come lord it's evident we're not
[2:06:35] ready we're letting the mouse dictate to
[2:06:38] us what our services ought to be we're
[2:06:42] letting the mouth tell us what it should
[2:06:45] be God we want our services to
[2:06:49] be what the intelligence
[2:06:52] tells us through the eyes and comes down
[2:06:55] through the mouth and speaks
[2:06:58] out the way you said it should be
[2:07:02] Lord granted
[2:07:04] father I'd rather have a dozen true
[2:07:07] prophecies in our
[2:07:09] church in 8 10 years whatever it would
[2:07:12] be than to have a whole bunch of Flesh
[2:07:16] and a whole bunch of stuff that ain't
[2:07:18] even in reality Prophecy in the first
[2:07:21] place
[2:07:22] no sir I don't want
[2:07:25] it I want the
[2:07:29] real send us genuine speakers with
[2:07:33] tongues genuine interpreters genuine
[2:07:37] ones that can speak true
[2:07:41] prophecy true discerners
[2:07:44] Lord and that discernment that belongs
[2:07:47] in the church body is not to replicate
[2:07:50] the prophet's gift
[2:07:52] cuz the eyes told us your pastor won't
[2:07:55] do this cuz there's only one to a
[2:08:01] generation we believe what them eyes had
[2:08:04] to say
[2:08:05] Lord but father we want discerners that
[2:08:08] can discern whether tongues are true
[2:08:11] tongues interpretation is true
[2:08:14] interpretation cuz that's what the eyes
[2:08:16] told
[2:08:18] us but of course many of our brothers
[2:08:20] are going back and insulting the
[2:08:24] mouth we don't want the mouth
[2:08:26] interpretation we see what it brought
[2:08:28] them
[2:08:29] to some of the quotes Lord that I've
[2:08:32] read in the last several months even
[2:08:33] dealing with question answers to the
[2:08:35] youth was taken from the sermon the
[2:08:38] prophet entitled where I think Pentecost
[2:08:43] failed and it was preached in
[2:08:48] 1955 and in a few days we'll be entering
[2:08:51] in the year of
[2:08:55] 2025 and we have some of the same things
[2:08:59] happening that he preached against in
[2:09:04] 1955 are we no farther up the road
[2:09:08] Lord help us
[2:09:10] Jesus Purge us Lord cleanse us oh
[2:09:16] God Hallelujah
[2:09:20] Jesus anybody here tonight feel that way
[2:09:23] Lord search
[2:09:24] me search me Lord Purge
[2:09:28] me what do we want in our church friends
[2:09:30] real gifts or just so-called ones that
[2:09:34] we can't identify Through The Eyes the
[2:09:37] only identification they have is through
[2:09:39] the mouth because the eye says something
[2:09:42] totally different give me the eye
[2:09:45] understanding as a matter of fact if you
[2:09:47] listen carefully to God being
[2:09:49] misunderstood you'll find God's Prophet
[2:09:52] speaking to the brothers at the church
[2:09:54] and said Brothers if you all will
[2:09:57] trust my understanding of the
[2:10:02] scriptures I'd like to come down with
[2:10:04] you that are gifted and show you how
[2:10:07] it's supposed to be set in order because
[2:10:10] that's the way Paul did
[2:10:13] it and that's the way it was done in the
[2:10:17] New
[2:10:19] Testament ah
[2:10:22] so the eyes identified with the
[2:10:24] foundation stone in the pyramid which
[2:10:27] means the alpha has become the
[2:10:34] Omega how many wants it that way can we
[2:10:38] just bow our heads and now remember
[2:10:41] we're not seeking after gifts I'm not
[2:10:43] making an altar called tonight oh how
[2:10:45] many wants a gift of tongues how many oh
[2:10:46] yes oh God oh God give me tongues oh God
[2:10:50] give me interpretation no but we desire
[2:10:53] I desire them yeah by Desiring that I'm
[2:10:56] not saying that I desire that I have
[2:11:01] them I'm saying I desire them in our
[2:11:05] body God can give it to everyone so God
[2:11:08] may give it to one of our sisters is
[2:11:10] that right would you brothers be okay
[2:11:12] with that the Holy Ghost can follow one
[2:11:15] of our sisters and give true tongues and
[2:11:17] fall on another sister interpretation
[2:11:19] yeah I'm fine with that amen I don't
[2:11:21] want it just to be on me or just the
[2:11:24] preacher's family or just me and the
[2:11:26] deacons and you know the the ones I can
[2:11:31] control I don't believe it ought to be
[2:11:33] me controlling them I believe it ought
[2:11:34] to be the Holy
[2:11:36] Ghost we desire earnestly the best gifts
[2:11:40] Lord those that will edify the
[2:11:43] body and help keep our church
[2:11:47] clean praise the Lord
[2:11:52] can we just pray
[2:11:55] together oh I know this is a solemn
[2:11:59] time
[2:12:01] hallelujah
[2:12:05] hallelujah oh Jesus help us
[2:12:09] father it's no wonder that your Prophet
[2:12:12] said that the Pentecostals and the mouth
[2:12:14] age they had so misused the
[2:12:17] gifts that he said just the mention of
[2:12:20] their name and it brought
[2:12:22] reproach and he said no wonder people
[2:12:24] didn't want them because of the way that
[2:12:27] they had misused him and they had made a
[2:12:30] reproach on it
[2:12:32] Lord there's people here like myself
[2:12:35] that saw gifts and if the gift was 100%
[2:12:40] wrong why nobody would listen to
[2:12:43] that but if it's hit and missed and hit
[2:12:47] and
[2:12:48] missed in the last few years Lord I've
[2:12:50] heard of one after another after another
[2:12:54] who went through prayer lines and was
[2:12:56] told this and that and the other you
[2:12:58] come up here with this person on your
[2:13:00] heart and they emphatically denied and
[2:13:02] said that is not true I did not have
[2:13:05] that person on my mind at
[2:13:09] all Lord Jesus help
[2:13:12] us Lord we don't want no
[2:13:16] guessing we want real
[2:13:19] father we want want real
[2:13:22] tongues real
[2:13:24] interpretation real wisdom real
[2:13:27] Discerning of spirits word of knowledge
[2:13:31] Word of
[2:13:32] Wisdom oh Jesus let the genuine fall
[2:13:37] Among Us oh
[2:13:39] God to keep Word of Life Church
[2:13:44] clean Lord when we get into it a little
[2:13:46] bit more and your Prophet crosses the
[2:13:48] country in the mouth age telling them
[2:13:52] how they ought to use
[2:13:54] them and little or none of them hardly
[2:13:57] any of them paid any attention to him
[2:14:01] brother Greg Parker told me some time
[2:14:03] ago about a church that he used to go to
[2:14:06] a Pentecostal Church in Louisiana that
[2:14:09] had the gifts that way I was
[2:14:10] flabbergasted by it by hearing it but
[2:14:14] they actually had it set up the way the
[2:14:17] prophet taught it they'd meet and gather
[2:14:20] and pray
[2:14:21] had men there Discerning the whole thing
[2:14:25] I thought my goodness what a
[2:14:27] rebuke a Pentecostal church that did it
[2:14:30] that way and message churches ridicule
[2:14:33] the prophets quotes and make light of
[2:14:36] his words that he
[2:14:38] used God forgive them I
[2:14:41] pray lay it not to their charge
[2:14:44] father may we judge our church Through
[2:14:48] The Eyes not through the mou Mouse if we
[2:14:52] were in the mouse age we would judge it
[2:14:54] by what the mouse understood and
[2:14:57] comprehended but we're in the eyes right
[2:15:00] next to the
[2:15:03] intelligence how foolish we are to
[2:15:06] bypass the eyes and go straight to the
[2:15:10] mouth and consult Pentecostal
[2:15:14] theologians how they did and what
[2:15:16] they've
[2:15:17] done oh Jesus
[2:15:21] help us father I
[2:15:23] pray we worship you tonight Lord
[2:15:27] God we bless your name Lord
[2:15:31] Jesus can we just lift our hands now in
[2:15:34] the presence of the king I know you kids
[2:15:36] got school tomorrow and you got to work
[2:15:37] tomorrow and you got to go
[2:15:39] but let's just worship a little bit let
[2:15:41] the Lord pour a little bit of oil in our
[2:15:44] wounds you know the word has that about
[2:15:46] it that it kind of cuts us up but that's
[2:15:49] all right if I need cutting tonight Lord
[2:15:51] let me have it I want to be ready
[2:15:55] father praise the Lord how many will say
[2:15:58] to me with me
[2:16:01] tonight as a person who comes here to
[2:16:03] this
[2:16:04] assembly let all hell know tonight where
[2:16:07] you
[2:16:08] stand how many will say with me by the
[2:16:11] uplifting of your hand you believe in
[2:16:14] true
[2:16:16] gifts you want true gifts in our church
[2:16:21] that will keep the church
[2:16:23] clean then don't any of you who stream
[2:16:26] our services and say we don't believe in
[2:16:28] gifts you are lying amen and not only
[2:16:32] will God judge you but we will judge you
[2:16:35] amen I do believe in them but remember
[2:16:38] the prophet tells us in the church age
[2:16:40] book that there will be men appear in
[2:16:42] the last day who will operate gifts with
[2:16:46] a
[2:16:47] margin of error
[2:16:51] I've seen what the error can do to
[2:16:54] people I've been dealing with some
[2:16:56] message people that have come through
[2:16:58] the margin of error and Gifts things
[2:17:02] that have been told them that were not
[2:17:03] true that did not come to pass I've seen
[2:17:07] the tears I've seen the
[2:17:09] anxiety and for some it has nearly
[2:17:13] destroyed
[2:17:15] them and you mean to tell
[2:17:18] me that's what gifts do
[2:17:24] no
[2:17:25] friends gifts don't cause the confusion
[2:17:29] it straightens it
[2:17:31] out God don't send gifts with margins of
[2:17:37] error you get perfect love first then
[2:17:40] you'll get perfect gifts so let me tell
[2:17:43] you this people who are operating gifts
[2:17:46] and our message that are
[2:17:49] imperfect they miss
[2:17:51] the foundation
[2:17:54] stone it's not so much their gift they
[2:17:57] don't have perfect love when they need
[2:17:59] to have it perfect love God's Prophet
[2:18:02] said
[2:18:03] produces perfect gifts

[2:30:57] another something over this way and they
[2:30:59] called its name and they recorded it and
[2:31:02] then they recorded great whales down in
[2:31:05] the
[2:31:06] ocean and then someone running through a
[2:31:08] computer
[2:31:09] program and this man was on the on the
[2:31:12] platform and doing it and he's a he's a
[2:31:15] nut him the message of course and he was
[2:31:17] talking and while he was doing it he was
[2:31:18] pulling these on an iPad so he started

[2:31:48] voices and then they put it all together
[2:31:51] and put it under a a gospel song that's
[2:31:53] sung on this in this day about greatly
