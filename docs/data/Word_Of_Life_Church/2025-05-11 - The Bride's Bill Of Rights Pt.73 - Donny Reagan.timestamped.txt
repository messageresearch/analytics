[9:07] Give the Lord a good hand clap of
[9:08] praise. Amen.
[9:13] Well, isn't it good to be in the house
[9:14] of the Lord today? Somebody say, "Praise
[9:17] the Lord." Praise the Lord. Look at your
[9:18] neighbor. Tell them you're glad to see
[9:20] him in the house of God. Praise the
[9:23] Lord. What a privilege it is to get to
[9:25] come to worship the Lord in spirit and
[9:28] in truth. So glad to have you here
[9:29] today. If you're visiting with us, we
[9:31] want to say we welcome you. Glad to have
[9:33] you here. All of our streamers locally
[9:36] and around the world, we want to say God
[9:37] bless all of those folks. Could we give
[9:39] all those folks a good hand this morning
[9:41] if you
[9:46] will? Praise the Lord. I'm going to let
[9:48] you be seated for just a bit. We have
[9:49] some prayer requests we want to let you
[9:51] know about. Brother Fred Britt sends
[9:54] this in a card of of thanks.
[9:57] Uh thank you all so much for your love
[10:00] and prayers. Fred and Pam Britt and the
[10:03] family of Christa Gross, they want to
[10:05] say thanks during the loss of a loved
[10:08] one. So, let's let's continue to
[10:09] remember those folks in prayer that uh
[10:12] the Lord would just be with them during
[10:14] this time. Brother M Carter in service
[10:17] with us today. Brother Mack, God bless

[10:29] all. Well, Brother Mack, we love you
[10:30] all, too, buddy. God bless you. Sister
[10:32] Ruth Louise Jax is homesick. Would like
[10:35] for us to pray for her and her family.
[10:37] So we want to remember that today. Want
[10:39] to pray for Eddie and Linda Jablonski.
[10:41] Both not feeling well today. So let's
[10:43] remember them in prayer. Brother Samuel
[10:46] Shuffler is sick asking for prayer.
[10:48] Unable to be in the service today. Let's
[10:50] remember him. Please remember brother
[10:52] Benjamin Goss as he recovers from open
[10:55] heart surgery. We'll remember that
[10:57] prayer request today as we pray. Uh then
[11:01] we have this testimony. Sister Janet
[11:03] Leman says, "I would like to praise the
[11:05] Lord for healing my throat and cough,
[11:07] which I have had uh been bothered with
[11:10] for quite some time. I want I went up
[11:12] for prayer at the end of the service and
[11:14] God touched me immediately and she wants
[11:17] to praise the Lord." Somebody say,
[11:19] "Thank you,
[11:20] Jesus." Amen. So, praise the Lord for
[11:24] for these uh testimonies this morning.
[11:26] All the unspoken prayer requests, I know
[11:28] there's there's needs in our group

[11:43] announcement. An engagement of Frederick
[11:47] Arnant and Eliza Davis. And they're
[11:51] sitting right over
[11:59] here. And might I say, one of the most
[12:02] handsomest couples in the
[12:05] church. You agree with that? Give them
[12:08] another hand if you would. God bless
[12:11] you. Praise the Lord. Let's stand to our
[12:14] feet this morning. We're just so glad to
[12:16] have each and every one of you here.
[12:17] We've come especially today to worship
[12:20] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in
[12:23] spirit and in truth. Aren't you glad you
[12:25] have spirit and truth? Are you glad
[12:27] about that this morning? And to all of
[12:29] our moms, we want to certainly say a
[12:32] wonderful, wonderful group of moms that

[12:38] you all a very, very happy Mother's Day.
[12:41] Can we give all of our moms a good hand
[12:43] this
[12:46] morning? Praise the Lord. Brother John,
[12:49] if you'd come this morning, take us to
[12:50] the Lord in prayer. We'll just commit
[12:52] all these things unto the Lord. God's
[12:54] good, isn't he? Are you glad you're

[14:10] Father. We're so in love with you, Lord.
[14:13] Yes. And sometimes, Lord, it seems that
[14:16] all we have is trouble and trial, Lord.
[14:18] But really, all we have is an
[14:21] opportunity to get closer to you,
[14:22] Father. Yes, Lord. And Lord Jesus, these
[14:25] needs that are represented here in my
[14:27] hand, Lord, along with the testimonies,
[14:30] Father. They they speak to that, Lord.

[14:40] hard things, Father. And we're thankful,
[14:43] Lord, that you're mindful of us in these

[21:15] you'll come on to the platform, be
[21:16] getting ready to sing after brother John
[21:18] and Josiah. Then, Sister Tama, she'll be
[21:21] singing. So, let's just give our singers
[21:24] a good hand this morning if you
[21:30] [Music]
[21:34] would. This song is about prophet Elijah
[21:37] and when non came to be cleansed of his
[21:40] leprosy. I pray it's a blessing to you.
[21:44] [Music]
[22:02] No eloquent prophecy or fancy miracle
[22:08] for all to see. Just the words go down
[22:13] seven times.
[22:15] [Music]
[22:17] So, as Non made his way into the Jordan
[22:22] River that day, I can't help but think
[22:26] what was on his
[22:30] mind. As he slowly reached the water's
[22:34] edge, it rushes in over his head. He
[22:39] looks to see if the curse has washed
[22:43] away.
[22:46] Oh,
[22:47] does
[22:49] he
[22:52] say I keep going down and getting back
[22:56] up, but I see no change. I feel no touch
[23:00] from
[23:01] you, Lord, where could you
[23:06] be? Well, this water's dirty and it's
[23:10] cold, but it's healing in it. So I'm
[23:14] told a
[23:16] miracle, but I've yet to
[23:20] see. But I'm staying here until you're
[23:25] through. Until I get a hold of you, I'm
[23:30] going to keep believing. But until then,
[23:35] I'm going to go down again.
[23:40] [Music]
[23:44] I know what I feel deep inside. I heard
[23:48] your voice a thousand times, but now
[23:52] that seems so long
[23:56] ago. Oh, but deep inside I still
[24:00] believe. Lord, somewhere you're
[24:03] listening.
[24:05] But I would like a sign so I could
[24:10] know.
[24:11] Oh, surely there's hope left yet. Cuz
[24:16] you wouldn't just forget. I'm fighting
[24:20] on my knees to get to
[24:24] you. So this is what I'm going to do.
[24:33] I'll keep going down and getting back up
[24:37] till I see a change or feel a touch from
[24:41] you. I know you're hearing
[24:46] me. For this place is lonely and it's
[24:50] cold, but it's holy ground. So I'm told
[24:54] the secret place where you will be with
[24:58] me.
[25:01] So I stay in here until you're through.
[25:05] Until I get a hold of you. I'm going to
[25:10] keep believing. But I feel it. I'm going
[25:14] to go down
[25:20] again. Head again.
[25:29] I'll keep going down and getting back up
[25:33] till I see a change or feel a touch from
[25:38] you. Cuz I know you're hearing
[25:43] me. Oh, this place is lonely and it's
[25:47] cold, but it's holy ground. I know it's
[25:51] so. It's the secret place where you will
[25:54] meet with me.
[25:58] So I stay here until you're through
[26:02] until I get a hold of you. I'm going to
[26:07] keep believing. But until then, oh, I'm
[26:13] going to stay here until you're through.
[26:17] Until I get a hold of you. I'm going to
[26:21] keep believing. But I feel I'm going to
[26:26] go down
[26:31] again. Oh, I'm going to go down
[26:36] again. Down again.
[26:44] [Applause]
[26:59] I wanted to make one quick announcement
[27:01] before brother Justin Reagan sings. Uh
[27:05] so glad to have brother
[27:08] uh I forgot who he was
[27:12] already. Sylvia's husband
[27:16] Lynn. Why'd you let me forget that?
[27:19] Brother Lynn Duggar is back in service
[27:22] with us this
[27:24] morning. Praise the
[27:27] Lord. And Sister Sylvia gave us a scare
[27:30] the other day, but the Lord has
[27:31] permitted her to be back in service with
[27:34] us today. I just want to say we're we're
[27:36] awful glad to have you all with us this
[27:38] morning. They're in their early 90s, but
[27:41] they look better than most of us here.
[27:44] Give them a good hand this morning if
[27:46] you would.
[27:52] [Music]
[28:13] Somebody's praying.
[28:16] [Music]
[28:17] I can feel
[28:22] it.
[28:24] Somebody's
[28:26] praying for
[28:29] [Music]
[28:32] me. Mighty hands are guiding me to
[28:38] protect me from what I can't see.
[28:44] Lord, I
[28:48] believe. Lord, I
[28:52] [Music]
[28:53] believe
[28:55] somebody's
[28:57] praying for me.
[29:02] [Music]
[29:20] Angels are
[29:23] watching. I can feel
[29:29] them. Angels are watching
[29:33] over me.
[29:37] [Music]
[29:39] There's many miles ahead till I get
[29:43] home. Still I'm safely kept before your
[29:49] throne. And Lord, I
[29:54] believe. Lord, I
[29:59] believe your angels are
[30:03] watching over me.
[30:09] And I've walked the barren
[30:13] wilderness where my pillow was a stone.
[30:18] And I've been through the darkest
[30:22] caverns where no light had ever shown.
[30:28] Still, I went on cuz there was
[30:33] someone who was
[30:35] down on their
[30:37] [Music]
[30:40] knees. And Lord,
[30:42] I thank you for those
[30:47] people praying all this
[30:51] time for
[30:55] me. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[30:58] [Music]
[31:02] Somebody's
[31:04] praying. I can't feel
[31:09] [Music]
[31:10] it.
[31:12] Somebody's
[31:15] praying for me.
[31:21] Mighty hands are guiding me to protect
[31:27] me from what I can't
[31:32] see. Lord, I believe.
[31:36] [Music]
[31:39] Lord,
[31:40] I

[32:59] Jesus, how can I tell you how
[33:06] beautiful you are to
[33:11] [Music]
[33:14] me,
[33:17] Jesus, song that the angels sing.
[33:26] Jesus, you're
[33:28] dearer to my heart than
[33:35] anything. You're sweeter than
[33:40] springtime. You're purer than sunshine.
[33:46] Ever my song will
[33:53] be
[33:55] Jesus, you're
[33:57] [Laughter]
[33:57] [Music]
[34:01] beautiful to me.
[34:10] [Music]
[34:16] Jesus, bright as the morning
[34:21] star.
[34:24] Jesus, how can I tell you how
[34:31] beautiful you are to
[34:36] me,
[34:39] my Jesus?
[34:43] song that the angels
[34:47] sing.
[34:50] Jesus, you're dearer to my heart than
[34:58] anything. You're sweeter than
[35:03] springtime. You're purer than the
[35:06] sunshine.
[35:09] ever my song will
[35:15] be. Oh
[35:18] Jesus, you're
[35:23] beautiful.
[35:25] Oh, how I love Jesus.
[35:30] [Music]
[35:36] Oh, how I love
[35:44] Jesus.
[35:47] Oh, how I love
[35:54] Jesus
[35:57] because he
[35:59] first
[36:02] loved. Yeah.
[36:04] Yes,
[36:07] Jesus loves
[36:11] me. Oh
[36:15] yes,
[36:17] Jesus, he loves me.
[36:22] Oh
[36:24] yes, my
[36:27] Jesus, he loves
[36:30] me. For the
[36:34] Bible tells me
[36:40] so. It tells me
[36:45] so. It tells me so.
[36:50] [Music]
[36:57] You're
[36:59] sweeter than
[37:01] springtime. You're purer than
[37:06] sunshine. Ever my
[37:10] song will be.
[37:15] Oh
[37:18] Jesus, you're so very
[37:23] beautiful
[37:26] to me.
[37:30] [Music]
[37:36] [Applause]
[37:48] What a great
[37:50] love. Aren't you grateful you know that
[37:56] today? Certainly want to wish all of our
[37:59] mothers a happy Mother's Day today.
[38:02] Trust it'll be a happy and a blessful
[38:04] day for you.
[38:06] Someone had sent me a quote earlier
[38:08] today was talking about a mother's love
[38:12] and the prophet said there was only one
[38:14] thing
[38:15] greater than a mother's love. That was
[38:18] the love of God.
[38:21] Wow. I just read that and I thought how
[38:25] astounding it is that a mother's love
[38:28] would be right up there if it's real
[38:29] genuine mother's love right next to the
[38:32] love of God.
[38:34] God bless you mothers for your
[38:36] sacrifice. All the years you give to
[38:38] your children trying to raise them,
[38:41] bring them up in the admonition of the
[38:43] Lord. May God bless all your labor.
[38:47] Amen. God bless you. The greatest thing
[38:49] I can say to you today, God bless you.
[38:52] Can we give him a nice appreciation
[39:03] clap? I certainly wish my mother was
[39:06] alive today so I could be able to call
[39:08] her on the phone and tell her how much I
[39:09] love her, what she meant to me. Uh, if
[39:13] your mother's alive, please do that.
[39:16] It's one of these days you'd give
[39:18] everything to be able to do it. Let's
[39:21] turn together if you would second Peter
[39:22] chapter 1:2. We welcome you today to the
[39:25] house of the
[39:28] Lord. We've not come for a protractive
[39:30] meeting today. We've not gathered here
[39:33] today because that's what people in
[39:35] Johnson City do or a lot of them or
[39:38] wherever you're from. We've come to hear
[39:40] from heaven. We've come to worship the
[39:43] true and the living God. Amen. To give
[39:47] him all of our hearts. We've come to
[39:50] find what our faults are, what our
[39:52] shortcomings are. We've come that we
[39:54] might be able to receive hopefully an
[39:58] impartation of God's divine knowledge to
[40:02] help us in our walk with him. Amen.
[40:05] Second Peter chapter 1 verse 2, grace
[40:08] and peace be multiplied unto you through
[40:10] the knowledge of God and of Jesus our
[40:14] Lord. the knowledge of God and of Jesus
[40:16] our Lord, according as his divine power,
[40:19] hath given unto us all things that
[40:21] pertain unto life and
[40:24] godliness, through the knowledge of him
[40:27] that hath called us unto glory and
[40:32] virtue, whereby giving unto us exceeding
[40:35] great and precious promises, that by
[40:38] these you might be partakers of the
[40:41] divine nature, having escaped escape the
[40:44] corruption that is in the world through
[40:46] lust. And beside this giving all
[40:49] diligence, add to your faith virtue, and
[40:52] to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge
[40:55] temperance, and to temperance patience,
[40:59] to patience godliness, and to godliness
[41:03] brotherly kindness, and to brotherly
[41:06] kindness, charity. So here we are living
[41:10] in
[41:13] 2025 and a statement was made in
[41:19] 1954 that whenever the
[41:22] pope will come out of the United States,
[41:28] then the church of the living God will
[41:31] be drove together.
[41:34] So, we see part of that
[41:36] prophecy was fulfilled this week.
[41:41] Now, the last time they had a a papal
[41:44] election, I done a little bit of reading
[41:46] and searching on it, uh, cuz I believed
[41:50] the prophecy myself, but I was reading
[41:53] of the conclaves and of the cardinals
[41:56] and all the things that they had to say.
[42:00] And they were saying then it would be
[42:02] totally
[42:04] impossible for an American to ever be
[42:09] pope. Of course, I read that and just
[42:12] laughed
[42:13] cuz I thought, my God specializes in
[42:16] impossibilities.
[42:20] And here we are today with the first
[42:22] ever pope from the United States
[42:26] according to prophecy.
[42:30] I told Carol one day this week, I said,
[42:32] 'You know, God sent America and the
[42:34] world, a prophet, the greatest gentile
[42:37] prophet that ever lived from the United
[42:40] States. America and the world for the
[42:43] most part, turned him down.
[42:47] So now they've got another one
[42:50] from the United States.
[42:53] I'm glad I know whose side I'm on today.
[42:57] Amen. Aren't you? Yes, sir.
[42:59] So the world's going to follow one or
[43:01] the other. It's going to follow the one
[43:03] or the other. We're taking our sides of
[43:05] Jesus today. How many like to be
[43:08] remembered as we pray?
[43:10] Amen. Lord Jesus, we thank you so much
[43:13] for your word.
[43:16] Lord, most of us have been saved for
[43:19] probably several several years and we've
[43:21] already come to the understanding that
[43:24] when you say
[43:25] something, you never have to take it
[43:28] back and your word never
[43:32] fails. We realize there's words that the
[43:35] prophets of the Old Testament spoke
[43:37] thousands of years ago that have not yet
[43:41] to this day been fulfilled.
[43:45] But we don't have to set up late at
[43:47] night and ring our hands and worry and
[43:49] fret. Will they happen? No. We can go to
[43:53] bed and sleep like a baby knowing that
[43:56] God's word never
[43:58] fails. I don't believe this message any
[44:02] more this Sunday morning than I did last
[44:06] Sunday morning. Last Sunday morning, we
[44:08] didn't have a pope from America, but
[44:10] today we do. But it doesn't make me
[44:13] believe anymore cuz I have a believing
[44:17] soul, a believing nature, a believing
[44:21] sea. I can't keep from smiling at the
[44:24] devil, though each time one of these
[44:25] prophecies come to pass. So now, Lord,
[44:28] we're waiting for the rest of that to
[44:30] come to pass when the church of the
[44:33] living God will come together. We're
[44:36] more divided than ever before. I ain't
[44:39] talking about the denominations and all.
[44:40] Of course, they will come together, but
[44:42] father, even in our own ranks, it's a
[44:45] paradox as we've already been told that
[44:48] as well, it'll be a paradox if she ever
[44:50] gets together. But he promised it and
[44:55] she
[44:56] will. So, Father, may that prophecy come
[45:00] to pass in our lives.
[45:04] We approach you today through mercy and
[45:06] grace and asking you that you'd help us
[45:07] in this service, helping to get out of
[45:09] the way to speak the words of life to
[45:12] your children in the name of Jesus. And
[45:15] the saints of God said, "Amen." Amen.
[45:18] God bless you. You may be
[45:21] seated. One of the virtues that we've
[45:23] been looking at for several weeks is
[45:26] that of knowledge.
[45:29] Holy Ghost
[45:31] knowledge, divine knowledge, knowledge
[45:34] that knows that the word is always
[45:38] right. Circumstances mean absolutely
[45:42] nothing. What people say mean absolutely
[45:46] nothing. But godly knowledge knows that
[45:49] God can never say anything that he
[45:52] cannot fulfill and bring to pass. Then
[45:55] truly there is a knowledge that God
[45:58] wants to share with us as his children
[46:02] about his will pertaining to our lives.
[46:06] One of the greatest things next to
[46:08] salvation of course and receiving the
[46:10] Holy Ghost, the seal of God, the
[46:12] acknowledgment of the word of God for
[46:14] the day is being able to find the will
[46:17] of God for our own lives and how this
[46:21] word that God has given to us. The
[46:25] pertinent part about it for us as
[46:28] individuals, where do I fit, where do
[46:31] you fit inside the message of the hour?
[46:35] That's the overview, but also where does
[46:38] it fit in my life from day to day and
[46:42] the decisions that I have to make in
[46:44] life and things that I'm faced with
[46:46] sometimes that I don't know what to do
[46:49] just like you are. And does God care? Is
[46:53] God even concerned about what we go
[46:56] through in life? Now, that's what the
[46:57] enemy would like to tell us that God's
[47:00] not really concerned about what we face
[47:03] and what we go through. He doesn't
[47:05] really care about that. But I'll tell
[47:07] you today that is a lie. He does con
[47:10] concern himself. As a matter of fact,
[47:12] the prophet tells us in the church age
[47:14] book, speaking of Israel, that he busied
[47:18] himself busy himself with the things
[47:22] that they were going through and their
[47:24] needs. And I believe that if you done
[47:27] that for the children of Israel, because
[47:29] they were the first fruits according to
[47:33] Jeremiah and according to Exodus 14,
[47:36] they were the first fruits of God's work
[47:40] of a nationality move that God had dealt
[47:43] with a particular people calling them
[47:46] out to himself. So if they were the
[47:49] first fruits, it was a sign that God
[47:51] would have many, many more that would
[47:54] come out after the first fruits. That
[47:56] would be holiness unto the Lord. That's
[48:00] why it's such an important thing that
[48:02] you and I whenever God calls us to
[48:04] himself that we are sanctified and set
[48:07] apart not just by the clothes that you
[48:10] wear and that's part of it. How long
[48:12] your hair is, brothers, whether or not
[48:14] you dress this way and do that. All
[48:16] that's important, but there's more to
[48:18] holiness than just the outside. There's
[48:21] also a holiness in the spirit. And
[48:24] there's a set aartness that God gives us
[48:27] in the way that we live. And that's why
[48:29] no believer under any circumstances
[48:33] should ever marry someone who do does
[48:36] not believe the word. Not only for the
[48:39] defilement of yourself, but you are
[48:42] defiling the position that God gives
[48:46] you, that you are set apart to him. But
[48:49] alas, a lot of people don't believe
[48:51] that. They believe their life is their
[48:54] own. I'll marry who I want. I'll do what
[48:57] I want. God has no say. Well, you know
[49:00] what? You're just proving to me that you
[49:03] do not believe what God says about you.
[49:06] that you are not your own. You are
[49:10] bought with a price. So you don't belong
[49:14] to yourself. Your life is not your own.
[49:16] Your money is not your own. Your home is
[49:19] not even your own. That's right. You
[49:21] belong to the Lord. Can the church say
[49:24] amen to that? Because he bought us and
[49:28] we are set apart. Therefore, our lives
[49:31] belong to him. Now whenever we look then
[49:34] at divine knowledge of how that God
[49:37] wants us to be sealed. Now remember
[49:39] there's seven virtues and each of them
[49:41] will be able to manifest himself in the
[49:44] life of every individual that goes in
[49:47] the rapture. Not everybody that says
[49:49] they believe the message but every
[49:52] individual that goes in the rapture will
[49:55] be sealed and the mercy of God will
[49:58] perform this great sevenfold work in
[50:01] their lives. So they live a godly life,
[50:03] a holy life, a separated life from the
[50:06] world. But not only that, but they will
[50:08] have these divine natures in them by the
[50:12] grace of God. So it will be knowledge,
[50:15] divine knowledge that the word is always
[50:17] right. But it will be knowledge too that
[50:20] will help us when we're going through
[50:23] things in life when life doesn't make
[50:25] any sense. Anybody ever get there? Maybe
[50:27] you're there today. It just doesn't make
[50:30] any sense. Not just the people of the
[50:32] world, but as children of God. Because
[50:34] God will do things in our lives and we
[50:37] will ask him, "Father, please move this
[50:40] way. Please do this and do that." And
[50:42] there's times that God will absolutely
[50:44] say no. And God's no sometimes will turn
[50:48] our world upside down. He will break our
[50:52] hearts. But yet, he does it because he
[50:55] loves us. And sometimes when that
[50:57] happens, it makes no sense whatsoever.
[51:00] Now, we've been looking at Paul and how
[51:02] that God had made known unto Paul a
[51:06] portion of the divine mystery of God for
[51:09] Paul's life. Now, each of you have a
[51:13] portion of God's divine mystery which
[51:16] can may be made known only to you. Now,
[51:20] that's of your life, your call, your
[51:22] walk of what God wants you to be. Read
[51:25] with me if you would in Colossians uh
[51:27] chapter 1:9. And notice as Paul writes
[51:30] this to the church at Colossian, he
[51:32] said, "For this cause we also since the
[51:35] day we heard it, do not cease to pray
[51:39] for you and desire that you might be
[51:42] filled." Now notice, not with just the
[51:46] Holy Ghost, not just with love, not just
[51:49] with forgiveness and mercy, but that you
[51:53] might be filled with the knowledge of
[51:57] his will. Now, would you notice that the
[52:01] Colossians already had a bit of the
[52:05] knowledge of God for their life, but
[52:08] that wasn't what Paul wanted them to
[52:10] have. Paul actually wanted them to be
[52:14] filled with the knowledge of his will.
[52:18] You know, when I read this, it makes me
[52:20] wonder how many of us as the children of
[52:23] God today fall so short of this verse of
[52:27] scripture in our lives. And we just
[52:30] wonder here and there and tossed about
[52:32] and well, I don't know what I'm supposed
[52:34] to do. I don't know about this. I don't
[52:35] know about that. Well, and we have to do
[52:38] one of two things with this scripture.
[52:40] We have to believe that God meant this
[52:43] only for the saints at Colass or God
[52:47] also means it for us and the thief is
[52:50] robbing us of this. And the saints said
[52:54] now I believe myself if it was for them
[52:57] it's for me also. So why don't I have
[53:00] it? Well, it can't be because of God. It
[53:02] has to be because of me. I'm being
[53:04] shortch changed and the devil is robbing
[53:06] me of understanding more about my life
[53:09] than what I presently do this morning.
[53:12] For this cause we also since the day we
[53:15] heard it do not cease to pray for you
[53:19] and to desire. So Paul prayed for the
[53:22] saints there and then he also desired
[53:25] that they could be filled with the
[53:28] knowledge of his will in all wisdom and
[53:33] spiritual
[53:34] understanding. So this was a blessing
[53:37] that the elect of God. Now would
[53:40] everybody at Colass receive that? No
[53:42] doubt they wouldn't. But he was praying
[53:45] for the elect. Now maybe maybe you think
[53:48] I'm strange today, but I pray
[53:51] differently according to the spiritual
[53:54] category of people that I'm praying for.
[53:57] I pray for the elect in one way. I pray
[54:01] for the foolish virgin in another way.
[54:04] Now it's not like that I have some type
[54:07] of spiritual insight that I here today
[54:10] can say elect, non-elect, bride, foolish
[54:12] virgin. I ain't talking about that as
[54:14] individuals. I don't know that. Thank
[54:16] God I don't. But I do pray for them
[54:20] categorically that God will help the
[54:22] elect to come to everything they're
[54:26] supposed to have in Christ Jesus that
[54:29] they need for the body change. I also
[54:32] pray for the foolish virgin that they
[54:35] will come in and be saved. I pray for
[54:38] the whosoever will group that they will
[54:41] be able to give their heart to God.
[54:43] Anybody understand what I'm talking
[54:44] about? I do not believe that every
[54:47] family member that I have will be bride.
[54:50] I don't think that I can pray for them
[54:53] if they are foolish virgin and my prayer
[54:56] will change them to becoming bride. But
[55:00] I do pray for them. You know whenever
[55:02] Abraham prayed for Lot, his prayer for
[55:05] Lot did not make Lot elect.
[55:09] And he didn't even pray that way. He
[55:10] just prayed that God would give mercy.
[55:13] And that's exactly what God did. God
[55:15] never even spared Lot for Lot's sake.
[55:19] God spared Lot for Abraham's sake. So it
[55:22] might be your prayers for your family or
[55:25] your loved ones who are not bride that
[55:28] God will save them and spares them.
[55:33] Praise the Lord. So I pray for them
[55:36] categorically depending on where they
[55:38] stand. It's a waste of time really for
[55:40] us to pray for the foolish virgin that
[55:42] they will wind up with all seven
[55:44] virtues. It's totally impossible.
[55:45] They'll never get it. So, I'm going to
[55:47] pray for them in the direction that
[55:50] spiritually they've been ordained to
[55:52] receive them. So, to me, I look at this
[55:55] and Paul is praying again categorically
[55:58] for the saints of God in Colossus that
[56:00] they would receive not just a little
[56:03] bit, but he said that you might be
[56:05] filled. Now this word is filled up to
[56:08] the ut utmost where there is no more
[56:11] room for you to contain it that you
[56:14] would be filled with the knowledge not
[56:17] of his word not where you could just
[56:19] quote the Bible boy you just know the
[56:21] Bible is just quoted right and left Paul
[56:24] wasn't praying for him for that as a
[56:25] matter of fact he never even prayed for
[56:27] that in the New Testament not one time
[56:29] have I found that Paul prayed for the
[56:31] saints of God that every one of them
[56:33] would memorize the New Testament but He
[56:36] what he knew was more important than
[56:38] memorization of scripture was them being
[56:41] able to have an understanding of the
[56:43] will of God for their life. Because you
[56:46] could know the Bible from Genesis to
[56:48] Revelation. But if you don't have a
[56:50] revelation of God for your own walk with
[56:53] God, you can live a complete defeated
[56:56] life every day you live on the earth.
[56:59] Because one day you think you've got the
[57:01] Holy Ghost and the next day you think
[57:03] you ain't. One preacher will preach the
[57:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost and he'll
[57:07] preach it in such a way that you're
[57:09] convinced you've got it. Another
[57:10] preacher will come and preach it maybe a
[57:12] little bit more on the legalistic side
[57:14] and brother Bram said that a preacher
[57:16] can preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[57:18] till he'll discourage his congregation.
[57:21] Now that's quite a balance for a man of
[57:23] God, is it not? And then you'll be
[57:25] convinced. Another man will preach it to
[57:27] such a place that you're totally
[57:29] convinced you ain't even got it. You
[57:30] know what you need? You need knowledge
[57:33] of the will of God for where you're
[57:35] standing before the Lord. And because
[57:38] you'll never go on until you're able to
[57:41] attain that that I am sealed with a
[57:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Am I without
[57:46] fault? No, that's not even the same
[57:48] thing. Do I still need help in my life?
[57:51] Is there anybody here today besides me
[57:54] that he's still working on you? You know
[57:56] what? I think most of us could sing this
[57:58] song about every day of our life. He's
[58:01] still working on me to make me what I
[58:05] ought to be. Anybody sing that right
[58:07] along with me? Because we know that we
[58:09] are a work in progress. But myself, I
[58:13] don't get up daily struggling with do I
[58:15] have the Holy Ghost. I do not struggle
[58:18] weekly or monthly or by yearly or
[58:20] whatever. Do I have the Holy Ghost? I
[58:23] don't struggle am I foolish virgin? I
[58:25] don't struggle with am I going in a
[58:27] rapture. If there is going if there's
[58:30] going to be a rapture, I am going to be
[58:32] part of it. Either by a resurrection, if
[58:35] I'm gone by the way of the grave, or if
[58:38] I'm alive and changed, I'm going to be a
[58:41] part of it because that's how much I
[58:43] believe what God has done in my heart.
[58:45] And if you don't believe that today,
[58:47] it's time you got to praying. Amen. So
[58:50] God wanted Paul to be able to write
[58:52] this. Now, Paul could have made this
[58:54] just a per a private personal prayer
[58:57] request before the Lord and never even
[58:59] wrote it. But apparently, he was led of
[59:02] the spirit of God. Not only that the
[59:04] saints at Coloss would know this, but I
[59:07] believe God knew before the foundation
[59:09] of the world that I would be preaching
[59:11] this right here today in May 2025. And
[59:15] there would be people in this assembly
[59:16] and people that'll go back and stream
[59:18] the service that they would need to hear
[59:20] this. And God had the apostle Paul not
[59:22] only write it down for then but had it
[59:25] wrote down for us in this day. Now we
[59:28] said that you might be filled with the
[59:31] knowledge of his will in all wisdom and
[59:35] spiritual understanding. Also read with
[59:37] me in Ephesians chapter 5 16. Redeeming
[59:41] the time because the days are evil. If
[59:44] he would say that 2,000 years ago, what
[59:46] would he say now? redeeming the time
[59:49] because the days are evil. Wherefore, be
[59:52] not
[59:53] unwise, but
[59:55] understanding what the will of the Lord
[59:59] is. Be not unwise. Now, this is a word
[1:00:03] that we use to describe who the unwise
[1:00:07] virgin of Matthew
[1:00:08] 25. So, be not unwise about what? about
[1:00:13] water baptism, about you know women
[1:00:16] preachers, can they preach is hell
[1:00:18] eternal? What about the seed of the
[1:00:19] serpent? No, be not unwise certainly
[1:00:22] about those things but understanding
[1:00:24] what the will of the Lord is. Now here
[1:00:28] we had uh several graduates in this time
[1:00:31] and no doubt many people around the
[1:00:33] world they're going through this time
[1:00:35] and they're trying to find the will of
[1:00:36] God for the life which is a great
[1:00:38] important thing but it's beyond your
[1:00:40] vocation. It's beyond, you know, shall I
[1:00:43] be a a painter, shall I be a farmer,
[1:00:45] shall I be a housewife, shall I be this,
[1:00:48] what shall I be? That's important to the
[1:00:50] Lord. But God wants us to know who we
[1:00:53] are in Christ Jesus. I hear the prophet
[1:00:57] say, "Oh, it means so much nowadays,
[1:01:00] church, to see ourselves positionally
[1:01:03] placed in Jesus Christ, knowing that
[1:01:07] you're not up and down and wishywashy."
[1:01:10] Now, listen to this. and the believer's
[1:01:12] position in Christ. In 1955, the prophet
[1:01:15] said the main thing is if we can find
[1:01:18] where God's word belongs in our life.
[1:01:25] Listen to this. If we can find the main
[1:01:28] thing, the main thing is if we can find
[1:01:33] where God's word belongs in our life.
[1:01:36] God sets
[1:01:38] times and time limits and then it works
[1:01:44] all to that time. I'll tell you what,
[1:01:47] what a powerful quote. Now notice this
[1:01:50] again. He said God sets times and time
[1:01:55] limits and then it works all to that
[1:01:58] time. It's amazing to me how that we can
[1:02:01] be called to do a certain work and you
[1:02:05] know I I don't I can't say that I
[1:02:06] understand it but the burden many times
[1:02:09] will forrun the time and you'll be a
[1:02:12] burden and you'll feel this and that.
[1:02:14] Brother Brandham felt it as a boy. As a
[1:02:17] boy sitting in a school room and he had
[1:02:20] to borrow a pencil and a piece of paper
[1:02:22] and he began to write a poem about a
[1:02:26] lion that he would kill years later. And
[1:02:29] as he wrote this poem down and then
[1:02:32] something started pulling him, pulling
[1:02:34] him toward the west in 1961. He tells
[1:02:37] his wife, you know, something pulling me
[1:02:39] out west and we've got to go. And she
[1:02:41] said, Bill, what about my mother? He
[1:02:43] said, "What about mine?" And he prayed
[1:02:46] that God would lift that off of him.
[1:02:48] About a year later, within that time
[1:02:50] frame, you've heard the sermon service.
[1:02:52] What time is it? His mother's passed. In
[1:02:54] that year, her mother's also passed. But
[1:02:57] it was like the burden was there and
[1:03:00] something was pulling. And what did God
[1:03:03] do? He already had a mother-in-law
[1:03:05] problem years prior to that. God was
[1:03:08] going to make sure he didn't have
[1:03:09] another one. Right? And the church said,
[1:03:12] "Now watch how people can feel the pull
[1:03:15] of something and if Satan can't stop
[1:03:18] you, then he will try to get you to jump
[1:03:21] ahead of the time frame of what God
[1:03:25] wants it to be." So there can be a pull
[1:03:27] and many times the pull from the seed,
[1:03:30] the pulsation of the seed within a
[1:03:32] person's soul and they'll feel it and
[1:03:34] they think because they feel it that the
[1:03:37] time is synchronized with the pull. Not
[1:03:40] always. Not necessarily. Now watch this.
[1:03:43] The will of God then for our lives.
[1:03:46] How's it? He says, it goes on to say,
[1:03:48] "Now, when you have a call from God,
[1:03:52] that doesn't altogether mean you should
[1:03:55] just jump right out and you're doing the
[1:03:59] will of God." Now, this will be, of
[1:04:00] course, for ministers and those who feel
[1:04:02] like they have a call of God. And many
[1:04:04] preachers have I talked to through the
[1:04:06] years and and they feel a call to do
[1:04:08] this and they jump out there and try to
[1:04:10] do it and it don't seem to work. No
[1:04:13] doors open. This don't happen. that
[1:04:15] don't happen. They may get a door here
[1:04:17] and maybe one over there in another six
[1:04:19] months. They think, "What in the world's
[1:04:20] going on? I'm ready to go. I'm ready to
[1:04:22] go. Boy, here it goes. Here it
[1:04:24] goes." But I wonder I wonder if God does
[1:04:29] not have a reason and he's molding and
[1:04:31] he's shaping. I I'll never forget and
[1:04:33] brother Daryl came to me years and years
[1:04:35] ago before he went full-time on the
[1:04:37] field and brother Daryl was working at
[1:04:38] the VA and he was also going out
[1:04:41] preaching. and come to me actually a
[1:04:42] couple times and said, "Brother Don, you
[1:04:44] know, I'm feeling this this this pull to
[1:04:46] go out." I said, "Well, Brother Daryl,
[1:04:48] do you think you can make it right now?
[1:04:49] You think you can make it financially?
[1:04:51] How many doors do you have?" And he told
[1:04:53] me at the time, Henman was there. I
[1:04:55] said, "Brother Daryl, I I mean, I'll
[1:04:57] pray with you, buddy." I said, "But to
[1:04:58] me, God will open the doors when he
[1:05:00] wants you to go full-time. It'll just
[1:05:02] all be there before you." He said, "All
[1:05:04] right, I'm praying. I'm praying." I
[1:05:06] prayed with him, and we just kept
[1:05:07] waiting and praying, waiting and
[1:05:09] praying. He come back to me again. Felt
[1:05:11] that pulsation even greater. By then
[1:05:14] there was enough doors around the
[1:05:16] message that was open and he said,
[1:05:18] "Brother Donnie, I'm bring a feeling
[1:05:19] into my heart." God opened the doors.
[1:05:21] Well, that's past history. You know the
[1:05:23] rest of it now. Because God has so
[1:05:26] blessed our brother. But he felt a pull.
[1:05:29] He felt a pulsation. But even in his own
[1:05:33] heart wondering about the timeline, I
[1:05:36] think it was pretty evident that the
[1:05:38] pulsation and the pull and the timeline
[1:05:41] was not yet quite synchronized because
[1:05:44] God has a time. And the church says now
[1:05:48] when you have a call from God that God
[1:05:50] that doesn't altogether mean that you're
[1:05:52] just to jump right out and you're doing
[1:05:54] the will of God. We have to find the
[1:05:57] will of God and the time of God to do
[1:06:01] it. Oh my. Moses thought, well, the
[1:06:05] children of Israel understand now that
[1:06:07] I'm to be their deliverer. So, he starts
[1:06:11] out to do so and he killed a man. And he
[1:06:14] found that the children of Israel didn't
[1:06:17] understand. Isn't it amazing? A man like
[1:06:19] Moses and he felt that pull in his
[1:06:22] mother telling him on her knees, you're
[1:06:23] you're the boy. you're the one that
[1:06:25] God's going to use. I just know it,
[1:06:27] Moses. And he would hear that. And what
[1:06:29] did Satan try to do? Mess up the
[1:06:32] timeline with the call of God. And he
[1:06:35] went right out and done it. I've seen it
[1:06:37] before with men that feel like they're
[1:06:39] called to be pastors. And they try to go
[1:06:41] out and start a work, nothing becomes of
[1:06:43] it. They go here and start another,
[1:06:45] nothing becomes of it. Or they go over
[1:06:46] here and get in a church and cause a
[1:06:48] split, nothing comes of it. Why? If
[1:06:51] God's in it, you don't have to make it
[1:06:53] happen. God himself will synchronize the
[1:06:57] time with the call. And then what do
[1:06:59] they do? Mess up the whole program of
[1:07:02] God because they missed the timeline.
[1:07:04] Now look at Moses after he does this and
[1:07:07] he has the blood of this Egyptian on his
[1:07:10] hands the rest of his ministry. How many
[1:07:14] preachers do we have that have blood as
[1:07:16] we would say on their hands because they
[1:07:18] missed the timeline? Now I know some of
[1:07:20] you ain't going to like this quote but
[1:07:21] I'm going to quote it anyway. when
[1:07:22] brother Ram talks about listen to his
[1:07:24] mother-in-law and he said it was the
[1:07:26] worst mistake I ever made in my life and
[1:07:29] he said when I stand before the Lord
[1:07:31] that day I will have to give an account
[1:07:33] for many souls
[1:07:35] come on message people I will have to
[1:07:38] give account for many souls Christ the
[1:07:40] ministry of God revealed when he talked
[1:07:42] about coming back into Jeffersonville he
[1:07:44] said every time I come back in through
[1:07:45] the knobs which was a high place there
[1:07:48] coming in the road he said every time I
[1:07:50] come through here I break out in hives
[1:07:52] Everything is dark and spooky. He said,
[1:07:54] "Why?" Cuz he still makes it hard on me
[1:07:57] because I didn't go out the first time.
[1:08:00] Now, notice timing is so important to
[1:08:03] God. Not just with preachers, of course,
[1:08:06] but with all of us in our life. And
[1:08:08] maybe some of you at that spot and you
[1:08:10] think, "I ain't doing nothing. Nothing's
[1:08:12] being accomplished in my life." Put your
[1:08:14] life in the hands of God. Don't try to
[1:08:17] make things happen. I would rather wait
[1:08:20] and be sure they that wait upon the Lord
[1:08:24] that's the thing my brother sister
[1:08:26] notice then he says about this about
[1:08:29] Moses of course notice again and
[1:08:31] earnestly contend for the faith I I
[1:08:33] think this is phenomenal Jesus done
[1:08:36] nothing in himself until he saw a vision
[1:08:40] of what the father said do then he went
[1:08:43] and done it listen these next two words
[1:08:48] That's Christianity.
[1:08:54] It makes you realize how many professed
[1:08:57] Christians don't have Christianity
[1:09:01] cuz they know nothing about the will of
[1:09:03] God. So they jump ahead of the world.
[1:09:05] The Lord Jesus was here to save the
[1:09:07] lost. Why in the world Why in the world
[1:09:11] would the father God wait for 30 years?
[1:09:17] before he'd ever fill him with the Holy
[1:09:19] Ghost. Yes, sir.
[1:09:21] Wasn't that 30 years
[1:09:26] wasted? I gave my heart to the Lord when
[1:09:28] I was 12. How come Jesus didn't go down
[1:09:30] the river and get the Holy Ghost at 12?
[1:09:34] Couldn't you done a whole lot more for
[1:09:36] God? No. You do more for God when you're
[1:09:40] on the timeline for God than when you do
[1:09:42] it by multiplication of years and this
[1:09:45] and this. But that's not the way we
[1:09:46] think. Oh, some of you is resenting it.
[1:09:48] I can feel it now. Go right ahead and
[1:09:50] resent it. But you're resenting God's
[1:09:51] word.
[1:09:54] Who would think God would make a man
[1:09:57] like John the Baptist put him through
[1:10:00] all that he went through on the back
[1:10:01] side of the desert and use the man for
[1:10:04] six months of ministry.
[1:10:11] Come on.
[1:10:13] And the God of heaven comes down to the
[1:10:15] earth in a created body and morphed
[1:10:17] himself into that human body that we
[1:10:20] call Jesus Christ. And God done more
[1:10:22] work in that three and a half years than
[1:10:24] he had done from there on back. Praise
[1:10:27] the Lord. But the way we look at it,
[1:10:29] it's always numbers. It's bigger. It's
[1:10:31] bigger. It's more. It's more. We're
[1:10:33] thinking wrong.
[1:10:35] God can do more with us in 6 months time
[1:10:39] if it's within his time frame than he
[1:10:42] could do with us in 56 years of our
[1:10:45] time.
[1:10:48] Oh my. You see why we need knowledge
[1:10:50] about the will of God for our lives. Now
[1:10:53] watch, let me read this to you again. I
[1:10:55] I thought this is such an awesome
[1:10:56] awesome quote. Then he went and done it.
[1:10:59] That's
[1:11:00] Christianity
[1:11:02] doing the will of God. That's
[1:11:06] Christianity doing the will of God. That
[1:11:09] was his life. That's what Jesus did. So
[1:11:12] what will Jesus do in you and I? That's
[1:11:15] what he wants to do.
[1:11:17] Christianity in our lives in God's time
[1:11:21] in how long it will be. How long will it
[1:11:24] last? God may call a man even in this
[1:11:26] day and use him for 10 years, five
[1:11:28] years, 15 years. Who knows? And people
[1:11:30] say, "Man, his ministry's just getting
[1:11:32] started and God take him off the earth."
[1:11:35] And people think it was cut off in his
[1:11:37] prime. No, not if God took him. It
[1:11:39] didn't. God used him. God set a timeline
[1:11:43] and God took him off the earth. Amen.
[1:11:45] And the church said,
[1:11:48] notice now the spirit of God as it
[1:11:50] started dealing with Paul about this
[1:11:54] place in his life with this thorn in the
[1:11:56] flesh that we've been looking at. And he
[1:11:58] said unto me, 2 Corinthians 12:9, "My
[1:12:01] grace is sufficient for thee, for my
[1:12:04] strength is made perfect in weakness."
[1:12:07] Now notice what God is doing. God is not
[1:12:10] building upon now the virtue of faith
[1:12:13] and giving Paul more faith. God isn't
[1:12:15] giving him more virtue or strength. God
[1:12:18] isn't giving him more patience. God
[1:12:19] hasn't given him more uh godliness or
[1:12:22] brotherly kindness. But God is sharing
[1:12:24] with him a portion of the divine
[1:12:27] knowledge of God which only father knew.
[1:12:30] Only father knew this. And he gives this
[1:12:33] understanding to Paul so that Paul can
[1:12:36] be changed by this divine knowledge and
[1:12:40] it will not only change him but by this
[1:12:43] example it will change millions of
[1:12:46] Christians that will read this scripture
[1:12:49] thereafter. People's lives are still
[1:12:51] being changed today because of this
[1:12:53] knowledge. And he said unto me, my grace
[1:12:56] is sufficient. So he asked for
[1:12:58] deliverance and got grace. He asked for
[1:13:02] healing and got grace. He asked for God
[1:13:06] to take it away from him, but God didn't
[1:13:09] take it. God left it, but God gave
[1:13:11] grace. Amen. So now Paul then didn't get
[1:13:14] angry. I can't believe you. I can't
[1:13:17] believe you. I I'm beat for you. I'm
[1:13:19] persecuted for you. I go through all
[1:13:21] these things of my life for you and I've
[1:13:23] got my own personal need and you won't
[1:13:25] even hear me. The reason he didn't do
[1:13:28] that was God had given to him divine
[1:13:30] knowledge about the will of God for his
[1:13:33] life. Do any of us want to hear these
[1:13:36] things about the will of God for our
[1:13:37] life? Most of us
[1:13:39] don't. Healings, miracles, signs,
[1:13:41] wonders. Oh my, we all get in the line
[1:13:43] first for that. How many wants to be
[1:13:46] tried and tested? We all stand at the
[1:13:47] end of the line. Amen. God's got a draft
[1:13:51] when it comes for trials and tests. The
[1:13:54] volunteer army is very, very small.
[1:13:57] So God has a draft for those and God
[1:14:00] don't say, "What about it, Lance? You
[1:14:01] want me to do this?" Or, "What about it,
[1:14:03] Caleb? What about this kid?" No, we say,
[1:14:05] "No, no, Lord. I prefer my brother. Let
[1:14:07] brother Donnie have my trials. Let so
[1:14:10] and so have my I I prefer my brother,
[1:14:12] Lord. That's okay. You want somebody to
[1:14:15] try, that's all right. Give it to Give
[1:14:17] it to my brother. I prefer them."
[1:14:20] So God just drafts and say, "You, you,
[1:14:23] you, you." You You You say, "No, no,
[1:14:24] don't shut up. You you you that's right.
[1:14:28] Now notice what this does to Paul. Look
[1:14:30] why we need knowledge.
[1:14:36] Most
[1:14:39] gladly.
[1:14:43] Therefore will I rather glory
[1:14:49] in my
[1:14:52] infirmities. Help me Jesus.
[1:14:55] Amen. Help me, Jesus.
[1:15:00] Most gladly, therefore, will I rather
[1:15:02] glory in my infirmities. And this is the
[1:15:05] reason why, that the
[1:15:08] power of Christ
[1:15:11] may rest upon me.
[1:15:15] You understand our faith didn't do this.
[1:15:19] Brotherly kindness didn't do this. What
[1:15:21] was it that changed his view? totally
[1:15:23] the opposite of what he had prayed
[1:15:26] for. Divine knowledge
[1:15:29] of the will of God for his
[1:15:32] life. Notice God rich in mercy. Brother
[1:15:35] Bam says, "See, I want to do his will
[1:15:37] and I ask him for something
[1:15:41] sometimes." And he shakes his head,
[1:15:44] "No." Yes, sir.
[1:15:47] Amen. I just rejoice so much about that.
[1:15:53] as I
[1:15:54] can if he said yes. Amen. Okay. All of
[1:15:59] you that need help again, go ahead and
[1:16:00] put your hand back up now.
[1:16:05] Now, can we say this?
[1:16:10] It's okay. Nobody move a muscle. We
[1:16:12] don't want to take you the wrong way.
[1:16:13] We're not doing doing an auction here
[1:16:14] today.
[1:16:16] Can we say this with all of our hearts
[1:16:20] that we pray and pray? Oh God, do this.
[1:16:23] Oh God, do that. God, don't take my
[1:16:25] baby. God, don't do this. Please, God,
[1:16:27] don't do that. Hear my prayer. Hear my
[1:16:30] prayer, Lord. We quote the scripture. We
[1:16:32] join together with the brothers and
[1:16:33] sisters and we turn in prayer requests
[1:16:35] and we post it on Facebook. Well, there
[1:16:37] are a few things that thing's even good
[1:16:39] for. And we post it on Facebook and we
[1:16:41] confess his word and we believe it.
[1:16:43] Every day we get up. Yes. Yes. God's
[1:16:45] going to do this. God's going to do
[1:16:47] that. And he'll let you go for weeks and
[1:16:49] months, sometimes in total silence, and
[1:16:52] then all of a sudden, God shakes his
[1:16:54] head.
[1:16:56] That's right. Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:17:00] And you say, "Glory to God. Thank you,
[1:17:03] Lord Jesus."
[1:17:06] Come on.
[1:17:12] We need knowledge
[1:17:14] of the will of God.
[1:17:18] Now listen to this. This is a
[1:17:20] man who lost loved ones. This is a man
[1:17:25] whenever he's laying there, his wife is
[1:17:27] laying there, excuse me, and she says,
[1:17:28] "Bill, you know why I'm going, don't
[1:17:31] you?"
[1:17:33] Oh, he said it like to broke my
[1:17:36] heart. You know why I'm going, don't
[1:17:40] you? God took his wife. God took his
[1:17:43] baby. God took his daddy. God took his
[1:17:45] brother within months apart. Nearly
[1:17:48] crushed him,
[1:17:50] tried to commit suicide.
[1:17:54] Had it not been for the grace of God, he
[1:17:56] would have done so. because the
[1:17:59] intention and the purpose he felt like
[1:18:01] he could not live why God said no.
[1:18:11] So we're not talking about a man that is
[1:18:14] just preaching theology but a man who's
[1:18:16] been there.
[1:18:19] Listen what he says. Because we always
[1:18:22] ought to ask thy will be done. his nos,
[1:18:28] if that's his will,
[1:18:31] it's a whole lot better than his yeses.
[1:18:33] Oh, yeah.
[1:18:36] But see, friend, why do nos hurt us so
[1:18:39] bad? Cuz we take it personal. And a lot
[1:18:43] of the nos have to do with our own
[1:18:47] personal loss. That's right. It's not
[1:18:52] what I wanted.
[1:18:55] Amen.
[1:18:59] Praise the Lord. He's still working on
[1:19:02] me. I don't know about you all.
[1:19:04] It's a whole lot better than his yeses.
[1:19:08] If it's his will to do it, that now
[1:19:11] notice that's
[1:19:14] when you really
[1:19:18] love him.
[1:19:22] You see, this is why people will quit
[1:19:24] serving God.
[1:19:26] when they pray over something and pray
[1:19:27] over something and God says no and they
[1:19:30] just turn away. What? Forget it. Forget
[1:19:33] it. They didn't really love him in the
[1:19:35] first place. Not right. That's right.
[1:19:38] But when God says no, this is the thing
[1:19:41] about
[1:19:43] nose. No can break our heart.
[1:19:51] I shared this quote today with brother
[1:19:54] Tim and brother
[1:19:55] Ron. I said to brother Tim, "Little
[1:19:58] buddy, I know you know this quote
[1:20:01] here. I know you're still dealing with
[1:20:03] it." He said, "Yes, and the pain will
[1:20:06] never
[1:20:09] stop until we meet him again."
[1:20:13] So, it's not like you buy the wrong car
[1:20:16] and you just say, "Man, I didn't buy a
[1:20:18] lemon. I bought a whole bag of them. I'm
[1:20:21] trading this thing. I'm getting rid of
[1:20:23] it. I'm I'm fixing this." Sometimes
[1:20:26] God's nose are so big and so major, it
[1:20:31] will affect you for the rest of your
[1:20:35] life.
[1:20:36] So, it's not like you can go there
[1:20:38] prayer like, "Brother, pray for me." God
[1:20:39] said no. and pray that God will heal
[1:20:41] this spot in my heart and pray that I'll
[1:20:43] get over it today. And the man like God
[1:20:45] lay his hand on you. You waffle in
[1:20:46] there. Praise God. It's over. It's over.
[1:20:49] It's
[1:20:57] done. Hallelujah.
[1:21:04] So Paul had a release from the throne of
[1:21:06] God with an element of divine knowledge
[1:21:08] and he said most
[1:21:15] gladly.
[1:21:16] Therefore I count it a
[1:21:21] privilege to be
[1:21:24] afflicted that my
[1:21:26] trials might bring God more glory.
[1:21:36] Testing. One, two, three. I I think
[1:21:38] we've had a disconnect here. One, two.
[1:21:41] Is everybody hearing me? Okay, y'all
[1:21:42] back in the mezzanine, y'all. Okay.
[1:21:43] Wave. Wave your hands at me, people in
[1:21:45] the back. All right. All
[1:21:48] right. How could he do this? What
[1:21:51] brotherly kindness? It wasn't virtue. He
[1:21:54] wasn't ministering that to nobody else
[1:21:56] yet. He had to get it first himself.
[1:21:58] Once he got it, then he could so change
[1:22:02] the way he looked at it. Yes, sir. It
[1:22:05] would almost make him seem like a
[1:22:07] neurotic.
[1:22:10] Someone who had lost their mind.
[1:22:18] I'm enjoying his
[1:22:20] favor. Imagine when he get up one
[1:22:23] morning and he never knew when it would
[1:22:24] hit
[1:22:26] him. might have went to bed the night
[1:22:28] before and he wrote some sermon notes
[1:22:30] and he could see crystal
[1:22:34] clear. The next morning he'd get up, the
[1:22:38] eyes were swollen
[1:22:40] shut and he called for somebody to come
[1:22:43] and help him. He
[1:22:45] couldn't he couldn't find nothing in his
[1:22:48] room and tell him to bring him some warm
[1:22:51] water and maybe he could wash his eyes.
[1:22:56] God had given him a great revelation.
[1:22:58] They had great meetings up and down the
[1:23:01] island of Cree. Over a hundred
[1:23:04] cities had come and they went back and
[1:23:06] he sent Timothy back and Titus to be
[1:23:09] able to establish the churches and
[1:23:11] pastors and actually have a great
[1:23:13] meeting and a great campaign. Then he
[1:23:16] get up the next morning.
[1:23:27] Paul say, "Glory to God. Glory to God.
[1:23:32] The success must been greater than what
[1:23:34] I thought.
[1:23:36] It must have been awesome." You okay
[1:23:38] today, Paul? Yeah, I'm doing pretty
[1:23:40] good. How y'all doing? Who is this I'm
[1:23:42] talking to? Oh, brother Paul, you're
[1:23:44] you're the church age messenger. Surely
[1:23:46] surely just lay hands on yourself. Oh,
[1:23:49] brother, I can't do that. You see, God
[1:23:52] has allowed this to be upon me. But it's
[1:23:53] for his power. It's for his glor. Can
[1:23:56] you imagine that have to lead him to the
[1:23:57] pull
[1:23:59] pit? Brother Paul, when you go up there,
[1:24:01] there's a rail there. It's kind of goes
[1:24:03] off to your left there. And just be
[1:24:05] careful, brother. We know you get
[1:24:06] excited when you preach. And be careful
[1:24:08] because there's some steps going down
[1:24:09] there. We don't want you to break your
[1:24:10] neck when you're going down there. Just
[1:24:12] be really, really careful. on his
[1:24:13] priest. Hallelujah. My Christ is an
[1:24:16] almighty God. He raised from the dead.
[1:24:18] He's a great deliverer. Anybody here
[1:24:20] need healing today? Anybody need devils
[1:24:23] cast out of you? And they'd walk up
[1:24:24] there and God would open their eyes and
[1:24:26] God would heal their crippled legs.
[1:24:29] G.
[1:24:31] And then somebody would have to lead him
[1:24:32] back off the platform
[1:24:36] and shame and
[1:24:39] humiliation for the glory of God. Yeah.
[1:24:46] Don't you understand how
[1:24:48] bad the devil would love to have people
[1:24:53] like you?
[1:25:00] All these believe the sign people that
[1:25:01] hate us so much. Let me just give you a
[1:25:04] little bit of insight.
[1:25:06] They wished they would give their item
[1:25:10] mama used to say they would give their
[1:25:18] item mighty warriors on their side. I
[1:25:21] guarantee you one thing. Every devil in
[1:25:24] hell wish that they could get a hold to
[1:25:27] brother Daryl or they could get a hold
[1:25:29] to some of other these other men of God
[1:25:31] and turn them against the message of the
[1:25:33] hour. You think the devil wouldn't love
[1:25:36] to have men like that with zeal? You
[1:25:39] think the devil wouldn't love to have
[1:25:41] some of you young people that give your
[1:25:43] heart, your soul, your mind, your body,
[1:25:46] your strength to the power of almighty
[1:25:48] God. And what does the devil get? Sorry,
[1:25:51] lazy, no good, rotten, good for nothing.
[1:25:53] But how he'd love to have people like
[1:25:56] you, but the Lord God done laid his
[1:25:59] claim on you before the foundation of
[1:26:02] the world. And he can say about his
[1:26:04] bride, "Nobody loves me the way she
[1:26:07] does." And I can tell her no, and she
[1:26:11] still loves me. I won't answer her
[1:26:13] prayer and she still loves me. And the
[1:26:16] devil said, "I wish I had some people
[1:26:18] like that."
[1:26:25] Amen.
[1:26:29] But you see, we're not for sale.
[1:26:33] [Applause]
[1:26:36] Amen. We're already bought and prayed
[1:26:39] for. We are not for
[1:26:47] sale. I will
[1:26:52] glory in my
[1:26:55] infirmities. You see now infirmities are
[1:26:57] not besetting sins that he's talking
[1:26:59] about.
[1:27:00] It's not corruptions and sins in his
[1:27:03] life. That would be blasphemous to say
[1:27:06] such a thing. Notice again in verse 10,
[1:27:09] it says, "Therefore I take
[1:27:14] read it
[1:27:23] pleasure. I take pleasure in
[1:27:25] infirmities,
[1:27:28] in
[1:27:30] reproaches, in
[1:27:32] necessities, in
[1:27:34] persecutions, in distresses.
[1:27:39] Truly, this man was one in a million.
[1:27:42] I hope we've got at least one or two
[1:27:44] more here with him.
[1:27:47] What in the world has happened to this
[1:27:49] man? Yes. Can you imagine the people
[1:27:51] that they probably saw, poor old guy,
[1:27:55] much studying has made him mad?
[1:27:59] He's
[1:28:00] rejoicing. This man, I I heard him say
[1:28:03] it. I heard him preach
[1:28:05] it. He's rejoicing.
[1:28:08] I take pleasure.
[1:28:11] Can I share with you the meaning of
[1:28:13] these words?
[1:28:15] I take pleasure.
[1:28:18] The word pleasure, be well
[1:28:20] pleased, think
[1:28:23] good, to do willingly, to be ready
[1:28:27] to to be favorably
[1:28:30] inclined towards one.
[1:28:37] Help me, Jesus. Let me raise both legs
[1:28:40] if I can get them up, too.
[1:28:45] Now we take pleasure in wealth and
[1:28:49] health and happiness and goodness and
[1:28:53] newer cars and newer houses and finer
[1:28:56] clothes and mall this and mall that and
[1:28:58] big vacations and whatever more. Well,
[1:29:00] that's our pleasure. That's where we get
[1:29:02] our pleasures and things out here. Oh
[1:29:06] my.
[1:29:11] Wow.
[1:29:16] I take
[1:29:19] pleasure
[1:29:20] in
[1:29:23] infirmities and infirmity means
[1:29:28] weakness,
[1:29:30] disease,
[1:29:32] sickness, want of
[1:29:37] strength to bear
[1:29:40] trials and troubles.
[1:29:44] You imagine Paul saying, "I take
[1:29:47] pleasure in one of strength." But do we?
[1:29:50] We despise it, don't we? Y'all love
[1:29:52] weakness? Anybody here love weakness?
[1:29:57] Anybody here love fear and frustrations
[1:29:59] and downtime in life?
[1:30:06] I take pleasure in infirmities, in
[1:30:12] reproaches, hurt, harm,
[1:30:16] holiness, a wrong springing from
[1:30:21] insolence, injury,
[1:30:24] inflicted, oh my goodness, notice this.
[1:30:26] want of strength and infirmities and
[1:30:29] then it reproaches hurt, harm,
[1:30:32] holiness, a wrong springing from
[1:30:35] insulence and you are taking pleasure in
[1:30:38] that.
[1:30:44] I'm a injury inflicted by the
[1:30:49] violence of a
[1:30:52] temptist.
[1:30:54] Violence. We're talking about a man who
[1:30:57] was in the deep 14 days and
[1:31:02] nights and never saw the
[1:31:05] sun one
[1:31:10] day. And I complain about flying on a
[1:31:13] plane for seven hours at 576 miles an
[1:31:17] hour and hitting
[1:31:23] turbulence in the
[1:31:27] violence. You imagine the spirit of
[1:31:30] God moving with such a knowledge of God
[1:31:34] to this man. It
[1:31:36] totally transformed him.
[1:31:41] probably even some of the saints said,
[1:31:43] "Have you noticed Paul?
[1:31:45] He's been acting really weird.
[1:31:49] He's been saying strange stuff.
[1:31:53] He's been saying, "Thank God. Thank God
[1:31:56] for these things we're going through,
[1:31:58] church. Thank God that he counted us
[1:32:00] worthy." He looked at us before the
[1:32:03] world began and said, "I want some
[1:32:05] people that can not only trust me for
[1:32:07] miracles and healings and signs and
[1:32:10] wonders. I want some people that will
[1:32:11] trust me when they have no answers at
[1:32:15] all." That's right.
[1:32:18] They look in the scripture. They look in
[1:32:20] the message. They go to church service
[1:32:22] after service and they beg me. They beg
[1:32:25] me for
[1:32:27] answers. And they leave service after
[1:32:30] service with hardly any to their
[1:32:34] questions of
[1:32:37] life. But they keep going back again.
[1:32:40] Yeah. And again and again and again.
[1:32:45] Instead of accusing me and saying how
[1:32:47] bad I am, they say, "Lord God, thank you
[1:32:50] for your mercy. Thank you for all that
[1:32:52] you mean to me. Thank you, Lord God, for
[1:32:54] all I've seen in my days. Thank you for
[1:32:56] pulling me out of the darkness of the
[1:32:58] world. Thank you for sanctifying me.
[1:33:00] Thank you for filling me with the Holy
[1:33:01] Ghost. Thank you for giving me a good
[1:33:03] family. Thank you for giving me a good
[1:33:04] pastor. Thank you for giving us a
[1:33:06] prophet. Thank you for giving us your
[1:33:07] church. I wish somebody would preach
[1:33:08] with me this morning. You have got so
[1:33:11] much to thank him for. Or you can go
[1:33:13] around with a mully grubs and feeling so
[1:33:16] sorry for yourself. Why don't you get
[1:33:18] sick and tired of feeling sorry for
[1:33:21] yourself and say, "God, you're my joy.
[1:33:24] You're my healer. You are my deliverer.
[1:33:36] Yes, sir.
[1:33:41] Oh my. Therefore I take pleasure in
[1:33:45] infirmities, in
[1:33:47] reproaches, in
[1:33:52] necessities,
[1:33:54] distress, necessary,
[1:33:57] needful,
[1:33:59] calamity, distress, and
[1:34:03] straits. Now, wait a minute. I thought
[1:34:05] the Bible
[1:34:06] said, David writing it, I once was young
[1:34:10] and now I'm old and I've never seen the
[1:34:11] righteous forsaken or his seed begging
[1:34:13] bread.
[1:34:15] But the Lord Jesus gives us a parable of
[1:34:18] a man laying at the gate of a rich man
[1:34:21] who was begging for bread.
[1:34:24] You see, friend, God's word has to be
[1:34:26] put in its right place or you'll make
[1:34:28] God a liar.
[1:34:30] That's what people are doing in this
[1:34:31] message, too. They're taking the message
[1:34:33] out of its exact per exact perplexed
[1:34:37] place that they find their minds into
[1:34:39] because they're pulling the message out
[1:34:41] and putting it with this. See there? See
[1:34:43] there? See this don't line up. That
[1:34:44] don't line up. It's not that it don't
[1:34:46] line up. It's you that don't line up
[1:34:48] with your thinking. It's got a proper
[1:34:50] place to put it into. And when we take
[1:34:52] it out, we'll make God a liar.
[1:34:57] Oh my. Well, I saw the Bible. Doesn't
[1:35:00] the Bible teach us that my God shall
[1:35:03] supply all of
[1:35:04] your need?
[1:35:09] Well, how come Paul isn't having his
[1:35:11] met?
[1:35:18] I know this ain't very deep, but it'll
[1:35:20] give you something you can take home
[1:35:20] with you hopefully. That's right.
[1:35:24] My
[1:35:25] my he says, "I pleasure infirmities and
[1:35:29] reproaches and
[1:35:31] necessities when my daily me needs
[1:35:35] aren't even being
[1:35:37] met." So he said he was in hunger and
[1:35:40] perils among
[1:35:42] brethren and perils among the
[1:35:44] countrymen.
[1:35:46] One thing after another after another.
[1:35:49] That's right. Imagine them demons out of
[1:35:52] hell must have said, "What kind of man
[1:35:55] is this?"
[1:36:00] That's what I want them saying about me
[1:36:02] before I leave this place. That's what I
[1:36:04] hope they can say about you before you
[1:36:06] leave this place. What kind of young
[1:36:08] girl is this? What kind of young man is
[1:36:10] this? What kind of preacher is this? No
[1:36:13] matter what we throw at them, they get
[1:36:15] right back up again. We knock them down.
[1:36:17] They get back up again. And we hear
[1:36:20] them. We hear them as they pray and they
[1:36:22] tell God, "Lord, I don't know if you
[1:36:24] even love me anymore or not. It seemed
[1:36:26] like you've forgotten my name. Lord, I'm
[1:36:28] going to church today and if you don't
[1:36:29] move for me, I don't know if I'll go
[1:36:31] back or not." We seen them go in there
[1:36:33] and sat down. We caused 13 crying babies
[1:36:36] to get around them. And they hit them
[1:36:38] with a lifesaver. They hit them with a
[1:36:39] rattler. They done this and that. And
[1:36:41] they thought, "Well, I might as well not
[1:36:43] get nothing out of service. I guess I'll
[1:36:45] go home." And they left church without
[1:36:47] anything. And you know what? They down
[1:36:49] on Wednesday night about 6:00 they
[1:36:52] started getting ready to go again and we
[1:36:54] said where you going and they said
[1:36:57] church hallelujah we have church on
[1:37:00] Wednesday night and I'm going to church
[1:37:02] and the devil are saying what kind of
[1:37:04] people are they what kind of people are
[1:37:07] they heard him say
[1:37:10] [Applause]
[1:37:15] no we saw
[1:37:20] him say
[1:37:22] no. And we thought that no would destroy
[1:37:26] them. And then we come around tempting
[1:37:29] them and said, "Are you going to quit
[1:37:32] serving God?" And you know what they
[1:37:34] said? No.
[1:37:38] They're saying what papa said. We need
[1:37:40] nos.
[1:37:42] We need nos sometimes.
[1:37:48] I like hunting
[1:37:51] turkeys. You ain't got nothing to worry
[1:37:53] about unless you're a
[1:37:56] turkey. And you watch them little pts in
[1:37:58] the
[1:37:59] spring. And that mother now, the
[1:38:01] gobbler, the mail bird, he he stays away
[1:38:03] from them. But that little hen, that
[1:38:06] that
[1:38:07] mama, she she's got certain sounds, purr
[1:38:12] and a cluck. And each little sound has a
[1:38:16] significant sound. Them little turkeys
[1:38:17] come out of them eggs, they don't know
[1:38:20] nothing from nothing. They don't know a
[1:38:22] fox from a hound. They don't know a
[1:38:24] hound from a jack rabbit. They
[1:38:26] don't know
[1:38:27] nothing. But they watch
[1:38:30] mama. Now mama that ugly head, I mean,
[1:38:33] she'll take that head and she'll
[1:38:36] them little ps will go, I don't know why
[1:38:38] they're even doing that, but mama's
[1:38:39] doing it.
[1:38:41] Let's get a tribute to Mother's Day.
[1:38:43] Mother turkeys.
[1:38:46] They don't know what they they don't go
[1:38:48] to turkey school. They don't graduate
[1:38:51] from turkey
[1:38:54] school. So mama will purr and
[1:38:58] cluck and then they'll see mama. She
[1:39:01] goes off the roost cuz turkeys roost at
[1:39:03] night. So mama will go down the big
[1:39:05] gobber. They'll fly down in the morning.
[1:39:07] and they go to moving around, you know,
[1:39:09] and printing their feathers or whatever
[1:39:10] more they do, getting the dust and all
[1:39:12] that sort of thing off of them little
[1:39:13] bitty old guys, they'll fly down there
[1:39:15] and
[1:39:22] just say, "What's that mean?" I don't
[1:39:24] know. Do you understand what that mean?
[1:39:25] I don't understand. I'm going to try to
[1:39:27] do
[1:39:29] it. I ain't got it yet, but I'm I'm
[1:39:31] going to work on it. I'm working on my
[1:39:33] prayer. That's what I'm trying to work
[1:39:35] on you this morning. All right. Except
[1:39:37] we're not a bunch of turkeys. We're
[1:39:39] eagles.
[1:39:40] Hallelujah. And we need to know how to
[1:39:43] say no sometime. Where we going to get
[1:39:46] it?
[1:39:48] Not from our
[1:39:49] mother, from our father. Yes, sir.
[1:39:54] Yes, sir. I'm glad my
[1:39:56] father knows how to say no.
[1:40:00] Because when I mess up so bad sometimes
[1:40:02] like you do and the devil goes up before
[1:40:05] the throne of God with my report
[1:40:10] card. And he said,
[1:40:14] "Huh?" Look like Donnie got an F here
[1:40:18] and F
[1:40:19] there, left F
[1:40:21] there. I did give him an A for
[1:40:25] stupidity and he got an A+ for
[1:40:27] ignorance. That's what most of us raise
[1:40:30] students, right? Spiritually. Yes,
[1:40:32] brother.
[1:40:37] And he asked my lawyer. So, you done
[1:40:40] with
[1:40:42] him? My lawyer said, "But you don't
[1:40:47] understand. I loved
[1:40:50] him before you were ever in existence,
[1:40:52] Lucifer.
[1:40:55] I thought of him before the world.
[1:40:58] ever be give up on him? No,
[1:41:04] never,
[1:41:06] never. I know the thoughts that I think
[1:41:10] toward you, they are good and not of
[1:41:13] evil. Are you going to turn your back on
[1:41:15] them, Lord Jesus? They brought so much
[1:41:17] pain on you. They've had so much sad
[1:41:19] this and that and the other to your
[1:41:21] priesthood. Are you getting tired of
[1:41:23] them? No. Never. Never. I can never
[1:41:26] leave them. I can never forsake them.
[1:41:29] Those are part of our language. So when
[1:41:31] the devil comes back to us, well, you've
[1:41:34] done this and you've done that and God
[1:41:35] didn't hear you. Are you going to quit
[1:41:37] serving him?
[1:41:39] Answer me. Are you going to give up on
[1:41:42] him? Are you going to lay down your
[1:41:44] cross and say no more?
[1:41:50] Are you pressing on? Don't say no. Now
[1:41:54] you see yeses have their place and nos
[1:41:57] have their nos. Only more that
[1:41:59] overcomers
[1:42:01] can we press ever wave by the grace of
[1:42:04] God. Yes.
[1:42:08] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Therefore,
[1:42:11] I take
[1:42:13] pleasure and
[1:42:15] infirmities and
[1:42:19] reproaches and
[1:42:22] necessities and
[1:42:25] persecutions and distresses.
[1:42:30] distresses,
[1:42:32] anguish, a narrow place,
[1:42:36] metaphorically, dire calamity,
[1:42:41] extreme
[1:42:45] [Music]
[1:42:46] affliction, dire
[1:42:50] calamity, and Paul's still taking
[1:42:52] pleasure. The devil probably said, "Just
[1:42:55] let him alone. He ain't he ain't going
[1:42:56] to hurt nobody. The man's lost his mind.
[1:42:58] Poor guy. I mean, he's totally just
[1:43:00] flipped out. He's He's of no
[1:43:03] consequence. Do you think anybody is
[1:43:05] going to read this that he wrote down in
[1:43:07] the Bible?
[1:43:11] Millions will raise their hands on that
[1:43:13] day. You imagine going to brother Paul
[1:43:15] and said, "Brother Paul, thank you for
[1:43:16] writing that in second Corinthians cuz I
[1:43:18] was in anguish, too. I was in distress.
[1:43:21] I I was in in need of this and need of
[1:43:23] that." And papa said, "No, but thank
[1:43:25] you, brother Paul, because that was one
[1:43:27] of my favorite scriptures." And I went
[1:43:28] back over and over and I said to God,
[1:43:30] "God, if you could do this for Paul, you
[1:43:32] can do it for me." What about you this
[1:43:34] morning? Do you think God is your God as
[1:43:37] well as he was Paul's God? Is he the God
[1:43:40] not only of Elijah, but he's the God of
[1:43:43] the bride?
[1:43:48] Hallelujah.
[1:43:55] Let me close here momentarily. Hebrews
[1:44:00] 13:5. Let your conversation be without
[1:44:04] covetousness, and be content with such
[1:44:06] things as you have, for he hath
[1:44:10] said, I will never leave thee,
[1:44:14] nor forsake thee. So that we may boldly
[1:44:19] say, "The Lord is my helper and I will
[1:44:25] not fear what man shall
[1:44:29] do unto me."
[1:44:33] Notice the prophet says, "Share
[1:44:35] knowledge, not worldly but spiritual
[1:44:37] knowledge of the word, knowing that what
[1:44:39] God said, do what God said." That's
[1:44:42] right. Then if you've got that and you
[1:44:44] can believe all these things that he's
[1:44:46] the same and all these things the word
[1:44:48] you can punctuate every word. Oh Lord,
[1:44:52] if you can punctuate every one of them,
[1:44:54] saints, with an amen, add that to your
[1:44:59] faith.
[1:45:02] Can't you see why folks in the message
[1:45:04] aren't any farther
[1:45:06] along? They think knowledge has been
[1:45:08] able to quote quotes and knowledge of
[1:45:10] dates and times and events. that's
[1:45:12] happened in brother Bram's life and that
[1:45:13] that's wonderful. But you also need some
[1:45:16] knowledge of events of what's happened
[1:45:18] in your life. What God done for brother
[1:45:21] Brandham is wonderful, but what about
[1:45:22] me? What what experience do I have with
[1:45:24] God? What experience do you have with
[1:45:26] God? Can you be able to go back to a
[1:45:28] spot and put your foot down and say,
[1:45:30] "All right, devil. From this day on, I'm
[1:45:32] through with you. I'm through with you.
[1:45:35] I'm tired of you robbing me of my joy.
[1:45:38] I'm tired of you robbing me of the
[1:45:40] happiness of my seal.
[1:45:43] Listen to me. I'm tired of you robbing
[1:45:46] me for the happiness and the
[1:45:49] satisfaction of my seal. We're not
[1:45:53] sealed today as a church. We're not
[1:45:55] sealed as a message movement. We are
[1:45:58] sealed as individuals. Yes, sir. And
[1:46:00] there is a happiness that comes
[1:46:04] with our seal.
[1:46:07] Oh,
[1:46:08] hallelujah.
[1:46:15] You punctuate that with an amen. Add
[1:46:20] that to your faith. That's amazing
[1:46:22] because God does the work and then he
[1:46:25] wants you to observe the work that he
[1:46:27] does and then he's waiting for your
[1:46:32] amen to tell
[1:46:34] him this is it. Father, I take that and
[1:46:39] I add
[1:46:40] it. Don't you
[1:46:42] understand? You and him are building
[1:46:46] this house together.
[1:46:50] He does the hard part. He just leaves
[1:46:52] you with a spiritual mass.
[1:46:56] I love it too because in this this mass
[1:46:59] here, it's only adding and never
[1:47:04] subtracting. And the stature of a
[1:47:06] perfect man is add add. As a matter of
[1:47:09] fact, the prophet called it seven
[1:47:12] adds. Seven adds add. So where's the
[1:47:16] multiplication? Where's the subtraction?
[1:47:17] In this particular type, we leave all
[1:47:19] the rest of them out. We're focusing
[1:47:21] right now on
[1:47:23] ads. Oh, glory to God. Well, isn't there
[1:47:26] multiplication and division and
[1:47:27] subtraction? Yeah. The Lord's
[1:47:29] subtracting the evil out of our hearts,
[1:47:31] the unbelief out of our life. He's
[1:47:33] multiplying grace. Well, glory to God.
[1:47:35] He divided us from the things of the
[1:47:37] world. But right now, we're focusing on
[1:47:39] add add until you are changed.
[1:47:49] M let me
[1:47:51] close yet. If somebody tries to tell you
[1:47:54] that the Bible has lost its
[1:47:56] power, that there's no such a thing as
[1:47:58] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, don't add
[1:48:01] that.
[1:48:03] It won't work. It'll fall off. Like
[1:48:07] putting clay on a rock.
[1:48:10] It won't stand up. It'll crumble. Then
[1:48:13] people tell you what, the Bible can't be
[1:48:15] trusted today. The Bible can't be
[1:48:18] trusted. Oh my. You be careful now. It
[1:48:20] can't be trusted. You heard that all the
[1:48:22] time. Little saying, you can't trust the
[1:48:24] Bible. Well, if you've got that in your
[1:48:26] mind, don't try to add it
[1:48:29] cuz it won't work. The whole building
[1:48:33] will fall down right there. She's got to
[1:48:35] be morted by the Holy Spirit. I mean,
[1:48:40] stuck together. the mortar that seals
[1:48:43] it.
[1:48:45] And the same thing that seals it. You
[1:48:46] know the way a vulcanized
[1:48:51] tube. There's a big portion of this
[1:48:54] congregation, they don't know what a
[1:48:55] tube is.
[1:48:57] You've been raised on tubeless tires
[1:48:59] your whole
[1:49:01] life. I'm afraid that's what's wrong
[1:49:03] with all the message folks. They're Holy
[1:49:06] Ghostless. Like
[1:49:08] tubeless. They got a mental conception.
[1:49:11] the message and the powers of hell come
[1:49:12] against them, they turn right back to
[1:49:14] the world. Oh my.
[1:49:17] Notice he says, you get a vulcanized
[1:49:20] tube, it always lasts longer than just
[1:49:22] an old stuck on
[1:49:26] patch. Mhm. A little heat gets stuck on
[1:49:29] an old patch on a tire and the first
[1:49:31] thing you know, you get that tire a
[1:49:33] little bit
[1:49:34] hot and run a little fast and it'll melt
[1:49:37] off.
[1:49:39] And that's what's the matter with a
[1:49:40] whole lot of people today. They try to
[1:49:43] stick their worldly knowledge or worldly
[1:49:46] knowledge on with a little old earthly
[1:49:48] glue.
[1:49:51] And when the trials come, well, maybe I
[1:49:53] was wrong. There goes the
[1:49:57] air and they're deflated in a few
[1:49:59] minutes. All your shouting and your
[1:50:00] jumping up and down didn't do you any
[1:50:02] good. And the people sees you right back
[1:50:05] in the same puddle again. That's right.
[1:50:08] But if you stay there with enough heat
[1:50:11] of the Holy Ghost till it makes you and
[1:50:15] the tube one, you and the two becomes
[1:50:19] one. And I put this note here underneath
[1:50:22] that. The original YouTube.
[1:50:28] Oh, hallelujah. The original
[1:50:32] YouTube. God, we don't want no patch of
[1:50:36] message. We don't want no patch of
[1:50:38] church entity. We don't want no patch of
[1:50:41] word of life. We want a vulcanized act
[1:50:44] of the Holy Ghost that so heats us.
[1:50:47] Hallelujah. Till we and the Lord Jesus
[1:50:51] melt into one.
[1:50:55] [Applause]
[1:51:03] Let's stand.
[1:51:07] enough heat of the Holy
[1:51:11] Ghost till it makes you and the
[1:51:14] tube
[1:51:15] one. That's it. You and the two become
[1:51:19] one. And when you stay there till you
[1:51:22] and every promise of God, you and every
[1:51:25] promise of
[1:51:26] God becomes
[1:51:28] one, then add that to your faith.
[1:51:32] If you
[1:51:33] don't don't add it at all. You say,
[1:51:37] "Well, the word can't be trusted." Don't
[1:51:38] try to add that. If you say the promises
[1:51:40] are here, the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:51:42] it was only meant for the twelve
[1:51:43] apostles, like some churches say today,
[1:51:46] don't try to add that. That's where
[1:51:49] foundations all crumbled up.
[1:51:55] Oh,
[1:51:57] children, how we love emotion and
[1:52:00] singing and music and we love all that,
[1:52:04] but that's not what vulcanizes
[1:52:08] us. Any of y'all know what what I'm
[1:52:10] talking about when it comes to the
[1:52:13] tube? About a dozen people. Lord have
[1:52:16] mercy. How old are some of y'all? Y'all
[1:52:18] look older than that. I mean, I'm just
[1:52:20] saying.
[1:52:25] So I never did have Harry and I didn't
[1:52:27] have many toys and stuff like that cuz
[1:52:30] we was raised very very poor. But my
[1:52:32] cousins, our cousins would every now and
[1:52:35] then Gary would he won a bicycle race
[1:52:37] one time at the stock car race in
[1:52:40] Monosel. He won a bicycle. Man, that was
[1:52:42] a big
[1:52:43] prize. So you know what he done with his
[1:52:46] used bicycle? He gave it to us.
[1:52:49] Well, the wheel was a little wobbly and
[1:52:51] it was scratched up and this and that
[1:52:53] and every now and then we get a flat
[1:52:55] tire in that
[1:52:57] bicycle. Now, them tires had tubes in
[1:53:00] them. So, I learned how to patch
[1:53:03] them. So, what you do is you have to
[1:53:06] take the tire the wheel off, of course.
[1:53:08] Then you take the tire at least halfway
[1:53:11] off. Sometimes you could remove one side
[1:53:14] and be able to reach in and pull the
[1:53:16] tube
[1:53:17] out. And then you go to looking left.
[1:53:19] Now what you do then is you blow it out.
[1:53:25] Find the
[1:53:27] hole. You see that's what's happened to
[1:53:29] some of y'all this morning. That's why
[1:53:30] you're puffed up.
[1:53:35] They had the Holy Ghost had a windbag of
[1:53:36] a preacher to blow you up. What am I
[1:53:39] looking for? Holes.
[1:53:42] That's good.
[1:53:46] Now, sometimes them things is hard to
[1:53:47] find. So, what you do is take them and
[1:53:51] baptize them.
[1:53:54] I've baptized many a tube, I'll tell
[1:53:58] you. And what you do is you blow it up
[1:54:01] and then you stick it down in water and
[1:54:03] then it'll start bubbling
[1:54:07] up. Then you stick your hand down in on
[1:54:10] the tube and you pull it out. Now, you
[1:54:12] have to scruff it up. You have to dry
[1:54:13] it. get real good and
[1:54:15] dry. And they'd come in a little kid
[1:54:17] about that big around and then about
[1:54:19] that tall maybe. And on the top of that
[1:54:21] lid, that metal lid was I don't know how
[1:54:24] to describe it to you, but just sort of
[1:54:25] like a sandpaper. And you'd scruff it
[1:54:27] up.
[1:54:30] Preaching does that to us, don't it?
[1:54:33] Scruffs us up really bad.
[1:54:36] But you see, if you don't, it won't
[1:54:38] stick.
[1:54:41] So you scruff it up.
[1:54:44] Depending on the size of the hole, you
[1:54:45] had different size of patches. Now, them
[1:54:47] little patches come with a little white
[1:54:50] clear type liner on the back half in the
[1:54:52] middle. So, you pull it open like this.
[1:54:56] They had to do it fast. You scruff it
[1:54:59] up. Take it. Lay it out like this. Got
[1:55:00] to scruff it out. All right. Hold it
[1:55:02] there, Harry. Hold it. Man, there's
[1:55:04] fixed several several different ones of
[1:55:05] them. Hold it now. And you have to put
[1:55:08] the glue on there. Then you've got to
[1:55:10] get a match or a lighter or something
[1:55:12] and you got to set that thing on fire.
[1:55:17] Glory.
[1:55:19] I'll tell you, this prophet might have
[1:55:21] been simple, but he had some profound
[1:55:22] things to say.
[1:55:24] So, you set that glue on fire and you've
[1:55:28] got to let it burn just so long where
[1:55:30] it'll kill all the world. I I mean g get
[1:55:33] this tube up real hot cuz what you want
[1:55:35] to do is make this tube and this patch
[1:55:40] become one.
[1:55:44] Lord children, how many have we pulled
[1:55:46] out of the Baptist church and the church
[1:55:47] of God and this and that and other and
[1:55:48] we've just stuck a little Malachi 4 glue
[1:55:50] on them and said, "Glory to God, you got
[1:55:52] her, brother." Amen. But what we need
[1:55:54] some Holy Ghost and fire to light them
[1:55:57] up. And man, when that thing catches on
[1:55:59] fire, it'll like that. So, like it did
[1:56:02] on the day of Pentecost. Peter got all
[1:56:04] scruffed up and John all got all
[1:56:06] scruffed up and Mary got scruffed up and
[1:56:08] my there appeared unto them a great
[1:56:10] patch lighter and the Holy Ghost come
[1:56:12] inside of there and tongues of fire set
[1:56:13] on each of them and the spirit of God
[1:56:15] lit. Now, you got to move fast. You got
[1:56:18] to move fast because you're heating up
[1:56:19] that glue just enough to make the
[1:56:22] molecules and the things that that's
[1:56:24] made out of and hair so much.
[1:56:27] Hard riding, swinging on grape vines,
[1:56:31] which we was pretty tough on them
[1:56:33] bicycles and riding. You done had it.
[1:56:35] You ready? Hey, you ready? Yeah. Let's
[1:56:37] do it. All
[1:56:39] right. Then you see that thing on there
[1:56:41] and you roll it. You're
[1:56:43] rolling. I tell you what, I've seen them
[1:56:46] to where you'd go back out and ride that
[1:56:47] thing and hit a rock, hit somewhere
[1:56:49] else, and it would make a new hole in
[1:56:52] another place before it would come back
[1:56:54] off that place right there. If it was
[1:56:57] done right,
[1:56:59] sir, young people, as your pastor,
[1:57:03] that's what I want to happen to you.
[1:57:08] May the spirit of God light your
[1:57:11] souls till he sends down the Holy Ghost.
[1:57:13] Not just a baptism in your spirit.
[1:57:16] An old coal patch. I've done that, too.
[1:57:19] An old coal patch and you just get take
[1:57:21] it out and stick it on there. It'll last
[1:57:23] for a while, but it won't seal you to
[1:57:25] the day of your redemption.
[1:57:27] Amen.
[1:57:30] Praise God.
[1:57:32] Don't you love him today?
[1:57:36] Let's marry us if you are.
[1:57:45] Oh
[1:57:48] Jesus, my father, I
[1:57:52] pray, Lord, through these simple
[1:57:54] illustrations, dear
[1:57:57] God, may we be able to receive
[1:58:01] something, Lord, that'll help us that'll
[1:58:03] change us.
[1:58:07] or I doubt there's probably a handful of
[1:58:10] people out of the hundreds that are here
[1:58:12] today that don't need an element of your
[1:58:15] knowledge in their life. Maybe it's
[1:58:17] about a child. Maybe it's about a
[1:58:19] husband, a wife, how to deal with them,
[1:58:21] how to do this or do that, a trial
[1:58:24] they're going
[1:58:25] through, the vocation, what they should
[1:58:29] become. Lord, as a pastor, I'm faced
[1:58:32] with so many decisions that can affect
[1:58:35] this church.
[1:58:38] I need you,
[1:58:39] Lord. I don't want to lead them in the
[1:58:41] wrong way,
[1:58:43] Father. Help me,
[1:58:45] Lord. I need you daily. It's not like,
[1:58:48] Lord God, that we get one dose of
[1:58:50] knowledge and that does us good the rest
[1:58:52] of our lives. We're facing things we've
[1:58:55] never faced before.
[1:58:58] I mean these people as I look at them
[1:59:00] fathers some of them I I married their
[1:59:02] mothers and fathers and I dedicated them
[1:59:04] as children as little
[1:59:07] babies. Now I'm old enough and seen so
[1:59:10] much of it that now I'm marrying their
[1:59:14] children before long dedicating their
[1:59:18] babies. Lord God, we need you. We need
[1:59:21] you like never before.
[1:59:25] We need faith and
[1:59:27] virtue. Oh, but God, we need
[1:59:30] knowledge. Give me knowledge and
[1:59:32] wisdom to guide your
[1:59:35] people. I know I have to stand before
[1:59:38] you one day and answer for every sermon
[1:59:40] that I've ever preached. Help me,
[1:59:44] God, as I counsel your people when they
[1:59:46] come to my office, Lord, and each one of
[1:59:49] them I realize I have to answer for at
[1:59:52] that day. Help
[1:59:54] me. Help these fathers and mothers.
[1:59:57] Maybe their children are going through
[1:59:58] things and they've never been this way
[2:00:01] before. They don't know what to do. They
[2:00:03] don't know what to say to them. They
[2:00:05] don't know how to affect them and how to
[2:00:06] influence them in the right way. Help
[2:00:09] each of us, Lord. Help our youth
[2:00:11] leaders. Help our Sunday school
[2:00:12] teachers, our
[2:00:14] deacons, the minister brothers, all of
[2:00:17] us, Lord. As
[2:00:19] ley, we need your knowledge. Oh, great
[2:00:22] God.
[2:00:23] If there's any here today, Father, maybe
[2:00:26] they've never even tried to make a
[2:00:28] repair on their life, but they're losing
[2:00:31] air
[2:00:32] quick. May the Holy Ghost come by this
[2:00:35] way and light them on fire,
[2:00:38] Father, and seal them. Maybe some Lord
[2:00:42] have tried the cold patch
[2:00:44] remedy, but they find theirel today at
[2:00:48] their wits end and they don't know what
[2:00:49] to do. And they just they they know
[2:00:51] there's something missing. They just
[2:00:53] know there's something
[2:00:56] missing. as Carol and I was talking
[2:00:58] about it
[2:01:00] yesterday and she reminded me when she
[2:01:03] came to you and gave her heart to you
[2:01:05] and then she received a baptism of the
[2:01:08] Holy Ghost in
[2:01:10] Pentecost. But yet she cut her
[2:01:14] hair and when she read the
[2:01:18] token, she said she knew when she read
[2:01:21] that she did not have what that prophet
[2:01:24] was talking about.
[2:01:27] So she stayed up all night long crying,
[2:01:32] praying, seeking no
[2:01:35] face. And the next morning, I did not
[2:01:38] see a
[2:01:39] woman with a cold
[2:01:42] patch, but I saw a woman that had been
[2:01:47] vulcanized.
[2:01:50] Hallelujah. By the Holy Ghost.
[2:01:55] a woman that you and your divine
[2:01:59] wisdom could take from her. One of the
[2:02:02] greatest things you could give a
[2:02:04] woman, a
[2:02:09] child, she's
[2:02:13] cried. How many tears have I seen her
[2:02:16] shed and how many have I not seen?
[2:02:19] But because you vulcanized her that
[2:02:22] day and you said
[2:02:26] no, she loves you now more than ever
[2:02:29] before. Like I
[2:02:32] do, like her sister Elishia does, her
[2:02:35] husband Lance, her
[2:02:37] children.
[2:02:39] Hallelujah. And all yesterday as we saw
[2:02:42] him and Ellie and their graduation
[2:02:45] and we dealt with mixed emotions. so
[2:02:48] happy for them and the milestone in
[2:02:50] their life yet so wishing their mama
[2:02:54] could be
[2:02:56] there. And I shed many tears like the
[2:02:58] others
[2:03:00] did. But Lord, because you've deposited
[2:03:03] a little bit of this knowledge in our
[2:03:05] hearts that you make no
[2:03:08] mistakes and your word is
[2:03:11] perfect. Then when we get done wiping
[2:03:14] our tears, we can say, "The Lord gives
[2:03:17] and the Lord takes
[2:03:19] away. Blessed be the name of the
[2:03:24] Lord." Oh Jesus, may the great
[2:03:27] vulcanizer of the Holy Spirit pass
[2:03:29] through this place
[2:03:31] today. May you change lives, Lord
[2:03:37] Jesus. Hallelujah.
[2:03:41] with every head bowed, please. No one
[2:03:43] looking around. I wonder if there's any
[2:03:45] here today
[2:03:46] that know or you're in question about
[2:03:51] whether or not you have the Holy
[2:03:54] Ghost. You You know you don't have it or
[2:03:56] you're just you're just not certain.
[2:03:59] Would you just raise your hand up to the
[2:04:00] Lord? And God bless you. God bless you.
[2:04:04] Amen. Yes, Lord
[2:04:07] Jesus. Thank you, Father.
[2:04:11] Now, I'm going to ask the rest of you
[2:04:12] there. You don't know who they were. You
[2:04:14] don't really need to, but I'm going to
[2:04:16] ask you to do me a favor if you would.
[2:04:18] I'm going to ask you to just lay your
[2:04:20] hand maybe over on their shoulder there.
[2:04:22] If it, brother, if you're standing
[2:04:22] beside a sister, it's not your wife and
[2:04:24] you feel uncomfortable doing that, just
[2:04:26] just move out of the aisle if you'd like
[2:04:27] to. Um, but let's just pray for one
[2:04:32] another. Maybe there's some here today
[2:04:34] that's gone through such a trial in your
[2:04:36] life that you don't know what to do. You
[2:04:38] don't have the answer. You don't know
[2:04:39] which way to turn, but may the Lord
[2:04:42] Jesus give
[2:04:43] you knowledge. May you be filled with
[2:04:48] the knowledge of
[2:04:49] God about his will for your
[2:04:54] life.
[2:04:58] Hallelujah. Brother
[2:05:00] Jonathan, come here. Pray for pray for
[2:05:02] the
[2:05:06] people. Hallelujah.
[2:05:08] [Music]
[2:05:11] Hallelujah.
[2:05:17] Lord Jesus,
[2:05:19] help us today, Father. Oh Lord, as we
[2:05:23] come, Lord, at this special time, in
[2:05:25] this moment, how you're moving in our
[2:05:27] hearts and Oh, God. I Lord, I just as a
[2:05:31] young person, Lord, to see these these
[2:05:33] prophecies and things coming true, Lord.
[2:05:35] And it it just so special time, Lord
[2:05:38] Jesus. But it just makes my heart reach
[2:05:40] out, Lord, for my brothers and my
[2:05:42] sisters, Lord. Dear God, Lord, what's
[2:05:45] more important to us, Lord? Lord, as
[2:05:48] someone who's young, Lord, and I have a
[2:05:50] whole life ahead seemingly, but Lord,
[2:05:52] what's more important than getting to
[2:05:53] know you, Lord? And Lord Jesus, passing
[2:05:56] everyone every day, Lord, going to that
[2:05:58] graduation and seeing so many young
[2:06:00] people, Lord, just thinking about their
[2:06:01] future, thinking about their plans. But
[2:06:04] do they even care about you, Father, or
[2:06:06] Lord, to be so blessed to come to a
[2:06:08] place, Lord Jesus, where my desire,
[2:06:10] Lord, is not to myself, Lord, but for
[2:06:12] you, oh Lord Jesus, if there be anyone
[2:06:15] else in this room, Lord, anyone younger,
[2:06:17] anyone older, Lord, no matter the age,
[2:06:18] you see our hearts, Lord, and we're
[2:06:21] crying out to you. Father, fill us,
[2:06:23] Lord. Change us, Lord. Bring us closer
[2:06:25] to you, oh God. We worship you, Lord
[2:06:28] Jesus. You're so close, Lord. That's
[2:06:31] never been closer before, Father. But
[2:06:34] Lord, if if you came down, Lord, and
[2:06:35] said it wouldn't be for another hundred
[2:06:37] years, Father. May it so be in my heart,
[2:06:40] Lord Jesus, that no matter what would
[2:06:42] come my way, Lord, I just want to see
[2:06:44] the next day, Lord. I want to see it
[2:06:46] today, Father. Change my heart, Lord.
[2:06:48] Change our lives, Lord Jesus. Make us
[2:06:51] more like you, Lord. Where we can truly
[2:06:53] look, Lord, at one another, Lord, and
[2:06:55] see, God, where we can look in the word
[2:06:57] and say, "Father, that's me, Lord Jesus.
[2:07:01] We love you, Lord. Bless us, Lord Jesus,
[2:07:04] to be more like you. And Lord, when it
[2:07:06] gets hard, Lord, when we don't
[2:07:08] understand, Father, may we just praise
[2:07:10] you anyways, Lord Jesus. We'll
[2:07:13] understand it when we get there, Lord.
[2:07:14] Give us your mercy. We love you and we
[2:07:16] trust you, Lord Jesus. Change our
[2:07:18] hearts, oh God. We love you, oh God.
[2:07:21] Bless it now, Lord, in Jesus name. May
[2:07:23] we worship you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[2:07:26] Amen. Hallelujah. Thank Hallelujah.
[2:07:30] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:07:33] Thank you, Lord.
[2:07:36] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:07:41] We worship you, Lord. We worship you, oh
[2:07:46] God. Thank you, Father.
[2:07:49] Hallelujah. Let's just worship him now
[2:07:52] bit before we go. Can we
