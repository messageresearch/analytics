[12:08] [Applause]
[12:23] sure can say today that God has poured
[12:26] out his Mercy on each of us where would
[12:29] we be without it we so counted an honor
[12:33] and a privilege for us to be gathered
[12:35] together again here today again we'd
[12:38] like to express our appreciation for
[12:41] those of you that have come and been
[12:43] able to participate in the service trust
[12:45] you enjoyed the banquet last night those
[12:47] of you that were here all the
[12:49] preparation that they made and brother
[12:51] Andrew just did an outstanding job
[12:53] didn't he just so appreciate the word
[12:55] can we just stand together we'll ask
[12:57] brother Andrew if you'll come speak to
[13:00] us again this
[13:01] morning we want to just open our hearts
[13:05] today to see what the Lord has for us
[13:09] you come from different states and
[13:11] different provinces in Canada and no
[13:14] doubt the battles you face are very
[13:16] similar in some ways and very different
[13:19] in other ways but we know that our God
[13:22] is so mindful of us in the age that
[13:24] we're living you young people face
[13:27] things that no other generation ever
[13:30] faced we know in the days of the early
[13:32] church it would have been
[13:35] martyrdom as a matter of fact we have
[13:37] one record of of a sister named
[13:41] Sosa you can find this in Fox's book of
[13:44] Martyrs and a couple of historical
[13:45] places she had seven
[13:48] sons they took the oldest dismembered
[13:52] him they took the second one cut his
[13:55] bowels out on down one to another
[13:59] another to another for the cause of the
[14:02] Lord
[14:04] Jesus so even though more than likely
[14:07] most of you will never face such things
[14:09] but you're facing a different type of a
[14:12] battle yours is mental yours is going
[14:15] through the pure pressure and all the
[14:18] pressure that Satan has been able to
[14:21] turn up in this day and you may thinking
[14:24] yourself how will I ever be able to
[14:27] stand with people like that
[14:30] but in reality you're living in the most
[14:33] difficult age that's ever been and the
[14:36] same spirit of God that released an
[14:38] anointing to help those people I've
[14:42] often wondered what sister
[14:44] Sosa had to say when she went back to
[14:49] church and all the saints heard that her
[14:52] seven sons have been killed
[14:56] horribly I've wondered what her
[14:58] testimony would have
[15:00] been you imagine trying to get up and
[15:03] testify and say I want to thank God for
[15:06] his Mercy I want to thank God for his
[15:10] grace and all seven of your sons have
[15:13] been killed for the cause of Jesus
[15:16] Christ so remember he's mindful of what
[15:19] you go through as well and the anointing
[15:22] of God that was released in that day
[15:24] helped those young men to be able to
[15:27] give their lives and help that mother to
[15:30] be able to go back to church and say I
[15:34] don't understand why maybe some of you
[15:36] are here today and you have wies and
[15:38] wherefores and things that you don't
[15:40] understand and God doesn't promise that
[15:43] we'll understand all that comes our way
[15:45] but he promises I'll be with you and
[15:48] I'll never leave you and I'll never
[15:50] forsake you so as we approach the
[15:53] service today may you be able to pull on
[15:55] the gift of God and I want to say what
[15:59] um what an awesome time that it's been
[16:01] and I've asked the ministers as far as
[16:03] how it's been for them to be able to
[16:05] preach and and so on and both of our
[16:07] brothers have said that there's been a
[16:09] really wonderful pull and we're grateful
[16:11] for that that comes from you you see the
[16:14] pull don't come from them and the pull
[16:17] don't come from God and the pull don't
[16:20] come from Angels the pull comes from you
[16:24] so you have a need and you're pulling
[16:26] God help me God speak to me God give
[16:28] give me what I need that's your
[16:31] participation these meetings would be
[16:33] nothing or any others that you go to if
[16:36] it was not for you being there to be
[16:38] able to pull so whatever you need today
[16:41] we just want to approach the Lord
[16:44] together and ask him to come and use our
[16:47] brother and speak through him the words
[16:50] that we need how many has a need today
[16:51] in your life maybe it's Financial maybe
[16:54] it's physical maybe it's decisions that
[16:56] you got to make about your future but
[16:58] when know the Lord Jesus is mindful of
[17:01] us let's just sing together touching
[17:03] Jesus is all that matters and remember
[17:06] no matter how educated you might be how
[17:09] long you've been serving the lord how
[17:12] long you've been a Christian you might
[17:13] know the message so well you can quote
[17:16] the prophet word for word and all that
[17:19] is good we're grateful that you can do
[17:21] that but remember in the New Testament
[17:24] the four Gospels it was not the educated
[17:28] it was not the weal y the ultra Rich it
[17:31] was not those that kept every law every
[17:33] letter of the law that we have the
[17:37] descriptions of That was able to touch
[17:39] Jesus but it was those who believed him
[17:43] some had all those great attributes and
[17:45] they didn't believe him at all so
[17:47] whatever your need is today brother Ron
[17:49] Spencer and I have been texting back and
[17:51] forth before we come out in the meetings
[17:53] the meeting began this morning and he
[17:56] was telling me he said I feel like these
[17:58] types of of meetings help our young
[18:00] people to realize they have value in the
[18:04] eyes of God and in case you're wondering
[18:06] today I Echo that same feeling you have
[18:10] great value in the eyes of God God could
[18:13] have allowed you to live in the first
[18:15] age second age third age days of Noah
[18:18] whatever day it would have been but he
[18:20] chose you young people you young men you
[18:22] young ladies to live in this age Satan
[18:26] has made his claim against you our get
[18:29] them I'll pull them away but God has
[18:33] testified for you they will stand they
[18:37] will be

[24:23] ministry has touched and we certainly
[24:25] appreciate the work of the Lord that's
[24:26] going on here this weekend and I believe
[24:29] I believe we're standing in very special
[24:31] moments so if you have your Bibles this
[24:33] morning we just like to take a little
[24:35] thought that the Lord's laid on our
[24:37] heart for this morning you have your
[24:39] Bibles we'd like to look over in uh
[24:40] Matthew chapter
[24:42] 28 verse
[24:44] 5 Matthew chapter 28 verse5 and bring
[24:48] greetings from our home Church Full
[24:50] Gospel Lighthouse in Elton Virginia also
[24:52] from our pastor brother Ron Spencer and
[24:55] he sends his greetings to you and we
[24:57] certainly love you
[24:59] with all of our heart
[25:00] here hey brother Matthew God bless you
[25:03] this morning good to see you amen ain't
[25:06] it good to be in the house of the Lord
[25:08] amen Matthew chapter 28 and verse 5 and
[25:11] the angel answered and said unto the
[25:14] women fear not ye for I know that you
[25:18] seek Jesus which was crucified he is not
[25:22] here for he has risen as he said come
[25:24] and see the place where the Lord lay and
[25:27] go quickly and tell his disciples that
[25:28] he is risen from the dead behold he
[25:31] goeth before you into Galilee there
[25:34] shall you see him lo I have told you and
[25:38] they departed quickly from the Seiler
[25:40] now notice with fear and great joy and
[25:43] did run to bring his disciples words I
[25:46] absolutely love that portion of
[25:48] scripture right there because it shows
[25:49] us the mingled of emotions and passions
[25:52] that are running through the disciples
[25:54] here of great fear and joy at the same
[25:57] time so it shows shows us that there can
[25:59] be things that are laying there in our
[26:01] spirit or in our emotional realm and it
[26:03] it's amazing and it doesn't it didn't
[26:05] matter what the emotion was it didn't
[26:07] matter what the feeling that they were
[26:08] feeling but the expression of their
[26:11] faith is in the final of that verse
[26:13] there and they did run to bring his
[26:16] disciples
[26:17] word and as they went to tell his
[26:20] disciples behold Jesus met them saying
[26:23] all hell and they came and held him by
[26:27] the feet and worshiped him then said
[26:30] unto them Be not Afraid go tell my
[26:34] brethren that they go into Gile and
[26:37] there they shall see me may God bless
[26:40] his word you may be seated today in the
[26:41] presence of the
[26:48] Lord you amen today by the help of the
[26:51] Lord I'd like to take a just a little
[26:53] thought here on messengers of the
[26:56] Resurrection m messengers of the
[26:58] resurrection and brother brandham says
[27:00] in the message go tell he said he said
[27:02] oh there's been great messages he said
[27:04] but Easter C them all he said great
[27:06] messages he said Easter was all of it he
[27:09] said when the dead was made preparation
[27:12] he said that last enemy when he'd seen
[27:14] sickness he said we'd seen sickness
[27:16] healed in the Old Testament he said we'd
[27:18] seen Miracles performed in the Old
[27:21] Testament he said there was Visions in
[27:23] the Old Testament but every man went
[27:25] right to the Grave wondering would he
[27:27] ever rise again he said but on Easter
[27:30] morning when the disciples got the
[27:32] greatest message that any man could ever
[27:35] get what did they get go tell my
[27:38] disciples that I'm risen from the dead
[27:41] death had been conquered and the Bible
[27:44] says here in Hebrews chapter 2 therefore
[27:47] we ought to give the more Earnest heed
[27:49] to the things which we have heard lest
[27:51] at any time we should let them slip for
[27:54] if the word spoken by Angels was
[27:57] steadfast and every transgression and
[28:00] Disobedience received a just recompense
[28:02] of reward how shall we escape if we
[28:06] neglect so great a Salvation which at
[28:08] first began to be spoken by the Lord and
[28:11] was confirmed unto us by them that heard
[28:15] him God also bearing them witness with
[28:18] both signs and wonders and with diverse
[28:20] Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost
[28:23] according to his own will as we said
[28:26] we'd like to take a thought here on on
[28:28] messengers of the resurrection and
[28:30] Webster tells us what a what a messenger
[28:32] is it's one who Bears a message or an
[28:35] errand it's somebody that is known as a
[28:37] Harbinger or a forerunner or he that
[28:40] fores shows it somebody no matter
[28:42] whether it's a verbal communication or
[28:44] if it's a written communication they're
[28:46] taking out a notice or an invitation and
[28:48] they are delivering a message and the
[28:51] Bible said in Proverbs 13-1 17 that a
[28:54] wicked messenger falleth into Mischief
[28:57] but a faith F Ambassador is Health a
[29:01] faithful Ambassador is health so it
[29:03] tells us that a trustworthy and a wise
[29:05] messenger he releases he releases
[29:08] healing wherever he goes and I think
[29:10] it's a very powerful thing to to know
[29:12] that today that everywhere that we go we
[29:14] don't have to release bad news by the
[29:16] words of our mouth or by our Expressions
[29:19] upon our body but I believe it's a very
[29:21] powerful thing to recognize that we have
[29:23] the ability to release healing to
[29:26] wherever that we go the Bible says in
[29:29] Proverbs 25 and 13 as the cold of snow
[29:32] and in the time of harvest so is a
[29:35] faithful Messenger to them that send him
[29:39] for he refreshes the soul of his Masters
[29:42] and I believe that if we're going to do
[29:44] anything we want to do something that is
[29:46] going to refresh our Master now anybody
[29:49] anybody can carry news but the value in
[29:52] the messenger is the message that he
[29:55] carries because we recognize that that
[29:57] anybody that's got a got a mailbox or
[29:59] got a got a post office that they go to
[30:01] that there there the mailman can carry
[30:04] he can carry in his in his brief case
[30:06] where he can carry in his van he can
[30:08] carry checks to you that can bless you
[30:10] or he can carry bills in the in and
[30:12] place it in your mailbox that you'll
[30:14] surely not a whole lot think about him
[30:16] so he can carry either good news or he
[30:19] can carry bad news and you've heard the
[30:21] expression don't shoot the messenger
[30:23] that the message came from a higher
[30:25] source and I believe that it's a very
[30:27] powerful thing that we recognize where
[30:29] the message that we believe in where it
[30:31] came from it didn't come from the mind
[30:33] of a man but it came from almighty God
[30:36] and I know that this message has caused
[30:38] it has caused Scruples and things but
[30:40] don't shoot the messenger this message
[30:43] didn't come from William brandom's mind
[30:45] but this message came from the real from
[30:47] the realm of almighty God where he would
[30:50] begin to release things for this
[30:52] generation that would raise a people
[30:54] into a standard that they would
[30:56] recognize that are the token on display
[30:59] so don't shoot the messenger and don't
[31:01] shoot our young people for living
[31:04] exactly what they're called to
[31:06] be I I know that there are certainly
[31:08] there are certainly people that would
[31:10] that would that would definitely rather
[31:12] maybe maybe they would rather have ups
[31:14] that would deliver their packages over
[31:17] FedEx because FedEx sometimes has a
[31:19] reputation of being able to miss deliver
[31:22] things and not make it to your house and
[31:24] I think it I think it's I think it's uh
[31:26] I think it's something that we that we
[31:28] notice is that they these these
[31:30] companies that deliver messages or they
[31:32] deliver your package they drop it off
[31:35] maybe they'll drop it off your address
[31:37] is such and such and they drop it off at
[31:39] your neighbor's house it's a MISD
[31:40] delivery but I want you to know there's
[31:42] there's one thing that God does not have
[31:44] he does not have a reputation of
[31:47] delivering your package that he's
[31:48] destined for you off at your neighbor's
[31:51] house when he's destined for your
[31:53] address when he's got blessings that are
[31:55] upon your roads that are coming to your
[31:57] house almighty God knows exactly where
[31:59] he's coming from so don't get mad today
[32:02] when God drops off the Deliverance for
[32:04] this brother when he knows exactly that
[32:06] that that brother needs that Deliverance
[32:08] don't get mad at God when God comes by
[32:10] your way and brings peace to this sister
[32:12] because he knows exactly what she has
[32:15] need of in her life and in that
[32:17] situation it's not a misdelivery but
[32:19] I'll put this in in your mind just now
[32:22] if you've made a declaration and you've
[32:24] ordered something from almighty God he
[32:26] won't MISD deliver any anything to the
[32:28] Church of the Living God he's got a
[32:30] reputation of being right on time it
[32:33] might look like he's running late it
[32:34] might look like he ain't coming but he's
[32:36] got a reputation Hallelujah that he
[32:39] always backs up his word and it ain't
[32:41] what you're doing in the moment but it's
[32:43] what God's got his eyes on you in the
[32:46] moment of your crisis he's right
[32:49] there and I'll say this and brother
[32:51] brandham said that the church he said
[32:52] not the bride he said but she's living
[32:55] off of past reputations back there in
[32:57] the L Ling time he said but you're not
[32:59] living back there under past reputations
[33:02] but there is a reputation the reputation
[33:05] keeper is our Lord Jesus Christ you
[33:08] don't have to pay somebody to keep up
[33:10] your reputation there's a God that not
[33:13] only seals you but he keeps you he
[33:16] guides you he protects you he's watching
[33:19] over you all the days of your
[33:21] life that's one thing that brother
[33:23] Brandon would say that God never he
[33:26] never he never held he never held Israel
[33:29] on what they was or what they was back
[33:31] in the day or what they had been he said
[33:34] but he held them to what they were at
[33:36] that moment and it's a sign to us that
[33:38] God does not have grandchildren that God
[33:41] does not have grandchildren where we can
[33:43] go off of the experiences of our
[33:45] grandfathers or our grandmothers but
[33:47] we've got to have a personal experience
[33:50] with almighty God because if you're ever
[33:52] going to be a witness for the Church of
[33:54] the Living God you've got to be you've
[33:56] got to have an experience
[33:58] and you can tell about brother Ron's
[34:00] Miracles you can tell about brother
[34:01] Donnie's Miracles you can tell about
[34:04] brother brother Daryl world's Miracles
[34:06] but what about your miracle and the only
[34:08] way that you're ever going to be a
[34:10] faithful and a true witness is that you
[34:12] have an experience with almighty God for
[34:16] yourself and I'll say this that you
[34:18] don't have to live here in depression
[34:20] you don't have to live here under the
[34:22] jurisdiction of hell but you are under a
[34:25] kingdom and that kingdom is not a weak
[34:27] Kingdom that it is a power it is an
[34:29] anointing I want you to know that today
[34:32] you don't have to sign up for a box of
[34:34] rattlesnakes because you didn't order it
[34:37] but if you sign for it it's your sin but
[34:40] you don't have to sign up for that if I
[34:42] was you I'd make a declaration I signed
[34:45] up for my joy I signed up for my peace I
[34:48] signed up for my Deliverance I signed up
[34:51] for the Holy Ghost I signed up for
[34:53] healing and when healing comes by my way
[34:57] I'll know that it met the
[35:03] master
[35:06] hallelujah
[35:07] hallelujah I was I was doing a little
[35:10] study a while back and I studying
[35:13] studying I got to reading about I got to
[35:15] reading I was kind of curious about it
[35:17] and I got to reading about the mail men
[35:20] in World War II and and how that they
[35:23] would how that it was their job to
[35:25] deliver the mail that it wasn't
[35:28] necessarily their job to fight in the
[35:30] battle but it was it was a job that they
[35:33] had been granted or or the the
[35:36] government would allow them to operate
[35:39] in and maybe they didn't necessarily
[35:41] pick up a gun but yet they had they had
[35:44] some of the most important jobs because
[35:46] they were not only were they carrying
[35:48] out death threats not only were they
[35:50] carrying out not only were they carrying
[35:52] out tactics for the battle but there
[35:54] were certain things that they were
[35:55] carrying in their in their mail back and
[35:58] I I found I found that there was a man
[36:00] that in that was in World War II that he
[36:03] he be to he be to express and tell his
[36:06] story of what it was like and he told he
[36:08] said I he said I was one of the most key
[36:11] components of the army or the battle
[36:13] that was happening in World War II he
[36:15] said because I W he said I was carrying
[36:18] the good news from back home and he said
[36:21] I was he said I was he said I would work
[36:23] out he said I was the first one off of
[36:25] the ship and he said I was the last one
[36:27] get back on the ship he said I recognize
[36:30] my job as one of the most important jobs
[36:33] he said because I would watch as I would
[36:34] take the mail into the camps of of the
[36:37] United States he said I would take them
[36:39] in there and he said I would literally
[36:41] watch it change the morale of all the
[36:45] all the fighters that were there in that
[36:47] war he said it literally changed the
[36:49] morale of all the saints he said when I
[36:52] would drop off the package or I would
[36:54] drop off the mail he said it was amazing
[36:56] to see he said there were certain men he
[36:59] said you'd watch it he said they would
[37:00] take it he said they'd recognize it was
[37:03] familiar handwriting he said they would
[37:05] begin to they would begin to smell the
[37:07] envelope and they could smell the smells
[37:09] of back home maybe maybe she was writing
[37:12] this maybe mama or or his wife was
[37:14] writing this while she was breaking
[37:16] baking bread and being able to go into
[37:19] that spot he was able to he was able to
[37:22] sniff it and it would take him from a
[37:23] spot of war and scars and and blood and
[37:26] agony but he was able to smell it and it
[37:29] took him all the way back what was it it
[37:32] was good news from home he said I
[37:34] literally watched as the people he said
[37:37] as they would read it it completely
[37:39] changed the morale from a spot where
[37:41] they were in a miserable spot to a light
[37:44] of Hope in a moment that they recognize
[37:47] that there's something worth fighting
[37:49] for oh if men in the natural could
[37:53] recognize that there's something worth
[37:55] fighting for to give them a renew hope
[37:58] how about us as Sons and Daughters of
[38:00] God should we be able to look into the
[38:03] script bag of almighty God and let it
[38:06] change our position in the fight maybe
[38:08] you've been a little bit down maybe you
[38:11] got a little cold on God maybe maybe you
[38:13] just need to sniff the letter of the
[38:15] word of God and find out that he's still
[38:18] your God maybe you need to pick up the
[38:20] mail maybe you need to pick up the
[38:23] package and look through the package one
[38:25] more time and find out that God's still
[38:28] God maybe you need to look through the
[38:31] word one more time and find out that he
[38:33] still got a promise for you in this
[38:35] generation he didn't leave you down
[38:39] here hallelujah he didn't leave you down
[38:41] here without a witness but I say it's
[38:44] time that we go reading through the mail
[38:47] of Psalms 18 oh I will love thee oh Lord
[38:52] my strength the Lord is my rock and my
[38:54] Fortress my deliverer my my God my
[38:58] strength what's David talking about he
[39:01] wasn't talking about his neighbor's God
[39:04] he was talking about his God I ain't
[39:07] talking about your God I'm talking about
[39:09] my God and maybe the god that you know
[39:12] and is powerful as the God that I know
[39:15] but the God that I know still delivers
[39:18] from cancer he still delivers from brain
[39:21] bleach that God that I
[39:24] know he's my God he's Mighty in battle
[39:29] he never has lost a battle he never
[39:32] gives up he didn't send you down here in
[39:34] Le Osa to see you go down into feet he
[39:38] sent you here to be a mighty Gentile
[39:45] Warrior I will call upon the Lord who is
[39:48] worthy to be praised so shall I be saved
[39:52] from my enemies the Sorrows of death
[39:55] they Compass me in the floods of the
[39:57] young Godly men made me afraid the
[39:59] Sorrows of Hell compassed me about the
[40:01] snares of death prevented me but in my
[40:06] distress in my distress I called upon
[40:09] the Lord and Cried unto my God and he
[40:12] heard my voice out of his Temple and my
[40:14] cry before him even into his
[40:19] ears maybe you're in battle and you need
[40:22] to change maybe you need to change the
[40:25] morale of your home but be ye of good
[40:27] cheer I have overcome the world Psalms
[40:30] 1:18 and6 the Lord is on my side I will
[40:34] not fear what man can do unto
[40:38] me is he really caring for me brother
[40:41] Andrew am I all alone down here in leot
[40:44] or does he really care for me when I go
[40:46] through troubles does he see me Psalms
[40:50] 34 and18 the Lord is nigh unto them that
[40:53] are of a broken heart and saveth such
[40:57] have be of a contrite
[41:00] spirit Lamentations 3 and 22 it's of the
[41:03] Lord's mercies that we are not consumed
[41:06] because his compassions fail not they
[41:09] are new every morning great is our
[41:11] faithfulness the Lord is my portion
[41:14] saving my soul therefore will I hope in
[41:18] him William brandham don't get your eyes
[41:21] on TL osburn's upon his Academy don't
[41:24] get your eyes eyes upon or Robert's
[41:26] Academy but the Lord is your portion
[41:29] bride don't get your eyes on Le oosa the
[41:32] Lord is your
[41:35] portion maybe you need to grab yourself
[41:39] an attitude check maybe you need to grab
[41:41] and allow this word of God to roll over
[41:43] your soul and bring a freshness back to
[41:46] your heart drive back every devil of
[41:49] Hell flush out all the enemies flush
[41:51] them out flush them out if the enemy's
[41:54] robbed you there's a God that restores
[41:57] if he's taking away your joy there a god
[41:59] that
[42:01] restores what does this word do it
[42:03] literally changes our spiritual altitude
[42:07] it takes us from one level to a Next
[42:09] Level and God sees your attitude and
[42:12] just like he saw hady right when she was
[42:14] sitting there she didn't have an
[42:16] attitude why couldn't that happen to me
[42:19] how why don't I create squirrels but she
[42:21] said that's nothing but the truth
[42:23] brother Bram she had the right kind of
[42:26] attitude and changed her situation so
[42:29] I'm saying to you young people it's not
[42:32] an emotion that changes your spiritual
[42:34] altitude it's not upon the things that
[42:36] you feel upon your flesh that changes
[42:38] your spiritual altitude but there is a
[42:40] message that we are carrying that lifts
[42:43] us into another realm that's why the S
[42:45] phenician woman when she was sitting
[42:47] there before Jesus and she had a very
[42:50] serious condition with her daughter she
[42:52] said Lord see my daughter here he said
[42:55] it's not meat for me to give the
[42:56] children bread over to you dogs but
[42:59] notice her
[43:01] attitude even so Lord the dogs eat the
[43:06] crumbs from the master's table maybe
[43:08] that's all you're here for this morning
[43:10] maybe you only showed up for a crumb in
[43:12] this meeting but I'll guarantee you if
[43:15] you grab a hold of one of these crumbs
[43:17] it'll change your situation it'll lift
[43:20] you into a realm that'll take you higher
[43:23] and one of these mornings
[43:29] I'll tell you how important you
[43:31] are that if Satan could already got you
[43:34] he would
[43:36] have but God's got a purpose in your
[43:39] life if he could he would disrupt your
[43:42] family he would disrupt your mind he'd
[43:44] disrupt the services if he could but
[43:47] you're so powerful that God allowed you
[43:50] to be destined to carry a message that
[43:53] would go until the very CL climax of
[43:56] this generation that you would be a
[43:58] final runner in the final generation
[44:01] because God Saves his best till last as
[44:04] brother Donnie was saying about those
[44:06] that had gave their life back there
[44:08] under the Dark Ages there was an
[44:10] anointing that would keep them in that
[44:12] generation under 68 million Martyrs that
[44:15] would lay there and give their life over
[44:17] to Jesus Christ how did they do it they
[44:19] gave it and were able to sustain because
[44:22] of the anointing that was there but God
[44:24] has not left you here without an
[44:26] anointing in there is an eagle anointing
[44:29] that takes you into a realm that only an
[44:32] astronaut can go
[44:34] to you change the situation by the
[44:37] atmosphere that you carry with the very
[44:39] word of
[44:41] God hallelujah brother Bram said in
[44:44] question answers he said but this
[44:47] message that I'm preaching is the true
[44:49] message this day and it's the last
[44:51] message he said you see what I'm doing
[44:54] Brethren I'm putting all you all in the
[44:57] same place that I
[44:59] am he didn't leave one of us out I'm
[45:02] putting all of you in the same place
[45:05] that I am this ain't some Catholicism
[45:08] religion where we leave it on the
[45:10] pastors and we leave it on the Elders of
[45:12] the church I'm putting you in the same
[45:15] place I don't care who your pastor is I
[45:18] don't care where you came from I'm
[45:20] putting you in the same place as I am
[45:23] cuz you're just as much into it as I
[45:28] am you are messengers of the same
[45:34] message go ahead and give the Lord a
[45:36] hand clap of
[45:43] Praise ah it's good to know it's good to
[45:47] know that it ain't just William bram's
[45:48] message it's good to know that it ain't
[45:50] just the preacher's message it's good to
[45:52] know that it's your message and God is
[45:55] as good as his word if he was with
[45:57] William brandom against every single
[45:59] devil that would line itself up against
[46:01] the Church of the Living God if you're
[46:03] packing the same message that William
[46:05] Brandon preached every devil has to
[46:09] bow has to
[46:12] Bow you say you don't know what you're
[46:14] talking about brother Angel oh
[46:15] absolutely I do I know exactly what I'm
[46:18] talking about this message that William
[46:19] Brandon preached is your message there
[46:22] was a brother one time there was a
[46:24] brother that bought a home one time and
[46:26] he he had bought B this home and when he
[46:28] went in there there was there was all
[46:29] kinds of I don't know any other way to
[46:31] say it but ghost up in the house and
[46:33] they was they would walk they they'd
[46:35] Walk The Attic up there at night time
[46:37] when they would lay down at they would
[46:39] lay down to go to sleep and and they
[46:40] would hear footw walks footsteps walking
[46:43] across the banister while they were up
[46:45] there and it went on for weeks upon
[46:47] weeks upon weeks and that man finally
[46:50] had enough of it but he recognized that
[46:52] the message that William Brandon
[46:53] preached was his message as well so he
[46:56] took a bunch of them spoken word books
[46:59] up there and laid them out across the
[47:00] banisters laid them all the way across
[47:02] that attic he said now try to walk
[47:04] across the word and it never walked
[47:07] again let me tell you something Church
[47:09] of the Living God all you got to do is
[47:11] put the message on display and it'll
[47:14] work every single time I've watched
[47:17] sugar diabetes bow to the name of Jesus
[47:19] Christ I've watched cancer bow to the
[47:22] name of Jesus Christ I've watched
[47:24] depression bow to the name of Jesus
[47:26] Christ because there is no other name
[47:28] given amongst men whereby we should be
[47:30] saved but by the
[47:36] name
[47:40] Hallelujah the one that entrusted you to
[47:42] run with this message shows the
[47:45] faith that he's God in the one that he
[47:48] gave the message to because Jesus would
[47:50] say about John the Baptist he said
[47:53] verily verily I say unto you among men
[47:55] among them that are born of of women
[47:57] there have not risen a greater than John
[47:59] the Baptist
[48:01] notwithstanding notwithstanding that he
[48:03] that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven
[48:06] is greater than he it doesn't matter if
[48:09] you're the lowest part of the body of
[48:10] Jesus Christ you're greater than every
[48:13] devil that could come up against
[48:15] you it ain't your workup it ain't your
[48:18] emotion it ain't your excitement it's
[48:21] the word of God that makes every demon
[48:24] in Hell bow
[48:29] hallelujah what was it John was to be a
[48:32] messenger not only just a prophet but a
[48:34] prophet messenger one that would forerun
[48:36] the first coming of Christ where where
[48:39] did the word meet John in that day it
[48:41] met him in the water where did the word
[48:44] meet the prophet in this day in 1933
[48:47] when he was baptizing his 17th person
[48:49] there in the Ohio River it was packed
[48:52] all around the United States even up in
[48:53] Canada that a local Baptist Minor was
[48:56] baptized
[48:57] and there there came out a star and hung
[49:00] over William brandham and said said
[49:02] these words as John the Baptist was sent
[49:05] to forun the first coming of Christ so
[49:07] have you been William brandham sent to
[49:09] forun the second coming of Christ it
[49:13] would happen over and over and over
[49:14] again in meeting on top of meetings one
[49:17] time in a in a cathedral in San Antonio
[49:20] Texas where William brandham was walking
[49:22] out there there was a little fellow that
[49:24] was sitting up there and he began to
[49:25] speak in tongues like a shotgun Fir and
[49:28] or a machine gun rapidly way back way
[49:30] back there he said a fellow rose up and
[49:32] said thus sayith the Lord the man that's
[49:34] walking to the platform is going forward
[49:37] with a Ministry that was ordained of
[49:40] almighty God as John the Baptist was
[49:42] sent as a first Forerunner of the coming
[49:45] of Jesus Christ so he packs a message
[49:48] that will cause the second coming of the
[49:51] Lord Jesus Christ let me tell you
[49:53] something Church you don't have to
[49:55] recreate the wheel just live the
[49:58] message just live the
[50:05] message there there he is that
[50:07] goodlooking dude sitting back there
[50:09] that's my cousin or I'm his
[50:12] cousin but we had a we had a great great
[50:15] grandmother that's brother Malachi right
[50:16] there W you stand up and let them see
[50:18] you they probably don't know you here
[50:19] yet that's my cousin he's a great turkey
[50:21] hunter if you got any hunting land see
[50:22] him up after church he'd be happy to see
[50:25] you you're
[50:30] welcome we had a great great grandmother
[50:33] and you can go ask him Miss after church
[50:35] he'll tell you the truth we had a great
[50:37] great grandmother name was Clara Spencer
[50:40] and and in the early 1930s brother Joe
[50:43] the Lord had visited my our great great
[50:45] grandmother and give her a give her a
[50:47] vision of what Elijah was of what Elijah
[50:50] was and who who he was and that had went
[50:53] that went some probably 30 30 some years
[50:55] and know it had been it' been 30 30 32
[50:58] years and it had she had carried that in
[51:01] her heart and my papa Charlie had come
[51:03] had come in contact with the message and
[51:05] the very first I think it's amazing the
[51:07] very first message that he ever got was
[51:09] the way of a true Prophet which brother
[51:11] Brandon would tell in the service right
[51:12] before he preaches the way of a true
[51:14] Prophet that he's going to preach on the
[51:16] trail of a prophet I think it's amazing
[51:19] that that there the Spencers were lined
[51:21] up to be on a trail of a prophet before
[51:24] Elijah was ever fully into effect of his
[51:26] Ministry and when my papa Charlie they
[51:29] they had them old spoken word only
[51:30] believe books and back in the day and
[51:32] they they had them there and and and and
[51:35] when he he went in he contacted the
[51:37] message and he he so fell in love with
[51:39] the message immediately he wented to
[51:41] share it with his family so he took that
[51:43] he took that little book in there I said
[51:45] Mama I've come in contact with a message
[51:48] and said he began to tell her certain
[51:49] things about it and he flipped over the
[51:52] fly leaf of that book and there was
[51:54] William bram's picture they used to have
[51:56] this picture on the inside of them books
[51:58] I many of us don't read books no more we
[51:59] read them right off our tablets anymore
[52:01] but back then they had them PCT a
[52:03] picture of brother brandom in the in the
[52:04] fly Lea of that book and there when her
[52:06] eyes fell on that before brother Charlie
[52:09] my papa Charlie could say anything else
[52:11] she said that's Elijah I saw him 30
[52:14] years before I ever seen this message it
[52:17] was a sign unto this generation that
[52:19] there was an Elijah Ministry that was
[52:22] coming that would cause the very second
[52:25] coming of Christ Christ Church you don't
[52:28] have to have a new thought young people
[52:31] you ain't got to recreate the will just
[52:33] live the message be the message preach
[52:36] the message live the message it's
[52:41] everything just be what the message is
[52:45] you have to put on something just prach
[52:47] a
[52:49] message I'll tell you what the message
[52:52] does just exactly like what William
[52:54] Brandon would say he said I want you to
[52:56] repeat this prayer you pray it I'll
[52:58] repeat it you pray it I'll just transfer
[53:02] the words that it takes to defeat Satan
[53:05] what is happening service after service
[53:08] Wednesday and Sunday Saturday and Sunday
[53:11] throughout the midweek what is happening
[53:13] there is being a transfer from Heaven
[53:16] Divine over to a church that has the
[53:19] power to defeat Satan by this
[53:24] message Hallelujah
[53:27] I'll just transfer the words that it
[53:29] takes to defeat Satan right to your lips
[53:33] and then you believe your confession
[53:35] that's your part that's your part it's
[53:39] brother Donnie's child problem it's his
[53:41] it's his part to preach the word it's
[53:43] your part to believe it come on somebody
[53:46] it's our part to preach it's our part to
[53:49] study it's our part to get ourselves out
[53:51] of the way but it's your part to line
[53:53] yourself up get behind this Joshua
[53:56] Ministry and let's run down and take
[53:59] everything that's rightfully
[54:03] ours then you believe your confession

[54:45] myself to you in the name of Jesus
[54:48] Christ how powerful is that how simple
[54:52] is that
[54:56] now you that are sick you repeated that
[54:59] now be healed in the name of Jesus
[55:02] Christ well is it that simple brother
[55:05] Andrew it's that simple because you've
[55:07] been given an authoritative word and you
[55:09] are not oblig Hallelujah you're not
[55:12] obligated to make yourself whole you're
[55:14] not obligated to make yourself feel
[55:15] something you're obligated to believe
[55:18] his word and let that angel of the Lord
[55:21] come slipping down your neighborhood
[55:23] maybe you got a Gord maybe you got C but
[55:26] the angel of the Lord knows exactly
[55:29] where you live and it might be 6 weeks
[55:32] before it shows up but you keep
[55:36] believing well what are you telling us
[55:38] brother Andrew I'm saying I'm saying
[55:40] that the word that you're carrying is
[55:42] not a dead letter it's a living word
[55:45] that you're a messenger of the same
[55:47] power that Rose Jesus Christ from the
[55:50] dead because the Bible said that we
[55:52] ought to give the more Earnest heed L at
[55:55] any time should let them slip for if the
[55:58] word spoken by Angels was steadfast
[56:00] notice brother Brandon picks that up in
[56:02] the Hebrew series he said do you hear it
[56:05] he said if the word spoken by angels He
[56:07] said the angel is a messenger he said
[56:10] the word angel means the messenger and
[56:13] he said just go and notice what brother
[56:14] random does he goes back to Hebrews
[56:17] chapter 1 it said God who innd times and
[56:21] in diverse manner spoke to the fathers
[56:23] By His prophets that was God's messenger
[56:26] he said they was God's Messengers they
[56:28] were God's angels a messenger is an
[56:31] angel or an angel is a messenger rather
[56:35] you recognize where we're living at it's
[56:38] the hour of the restoration of the Bride
[56:41] tree that it has been a restoration to
[56:45] prophesy the same things that the angel
[56:47] said in this generation you recognize
[56:50] what William brandham when he call is
[56:52] called beyond the curtain of time he
[56:54] said he said those words came to him his
[56:57] words came to him so well I preach what
[56:59] Paul preached I preached what Paul
[57:02] preached what Paul preach William
[57:05] Brandon preach and what William Brandon
[57:07] preached you
[57:09] amen you amen now I tell you what I
[57:12] enjoy all the shouting I enjoy all the
[57:14] Clapping of hands I enjoy you shouting
[57:16] down the aisles but there's nothing more
[57:19] as a man of God that Thrills my heart is
[57:21] when I see young people begin to amen
[57:24] the word of God because they saying to
[57:26] their situation I believe it so be it it
[57:30] doesn't matter Hallelujah if you feel a
[57:32] chill running down your neck or whether
[57:34] you're running down the corner just say
[57:36] Amen to it
[57:39] amen amen
[57:45] Amen brother brandom say you he said if
[57:48] there's a great big signal going through
[57:49] here that we don't capture with our we
[57:52] don't capture with our own eyes but it's
[57:53] a radio signal that come through here
[57:55] and it would say Amen across the
[57:57] congregation he said it'd be a great big
[57:59] thing across it he said but if there was
[58:01] something there that would be able to
[58:03] catch it then somebody would be able to
[58:05] catch it and identify that it said amen
[58:08] he said if one person caught it they'd
[58:10] say Amen to it he said but if a second
[58:13] person caught it there'd be the two
[58:14] times the power of Amen well I'd say
[58:17] there's more than two people in here
[58:18] today and he said where two or three are
[58:20] gathered in my name there I'll be in the
[58:22] midst of him I'd say we're closer around
[58:24] 300 400 some people but if oh if 400
[58:28] people could say Amen to the word of God
[58:31] what would Satan do this morning with
[58:34] somebody that lines herself
[58:45] up I had a I had a customer customer
[58:48] called me the other day actually on the
[58:51] way here and he told me is said now you
[58:54] got to understand
[58:56] he's not a very he ain't a saint by no
[59:01] means
[59:02] he he's in that world and he he's a he's
[59:06] he's respectful he's respectful to me
[59:08] and Dad and all of us but he's
[59:10] definitely not a Christian by no means
[59:12] but he called me other day he said it's
[59:14] been a very strange dream he said I very
[59:16] strange day he said had a crazy dream I
[59:19] thought I thought this pretty powerful
[59:21] he said I had a crazy dream he said this
[59:23] a guy I don't know anything about the
[59:24] message he's had a crazy dream that
[59:27] William brandham and you was sitting in
[59:28] my
[59:30] room and he said I couldn't understand
[59:33] what you were saying he said but you
[59:34] were both saying the same thing and he
[59:37] said he was trying to get me to
[59:38] understand now here's a guy I they got
[59:39] he ain't got a clue about what the
[59:40] message is he said William brandom I
[59:44] said well I tell you that's actually
[59:45] absolutely the truth he said because
[59:47] because I whatever William brandom said
[59:50] that's what I'd be saying and I maybe
[59:52] you don't understand it what's happening
[59:54] right now but I'm saying the same thing
[59:55] that that William brandham said and if
[59:57] William brandham would stand there night
[59:59] after night and demons would bow to the
[1:00:02] presence of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm
[1:00:04] saying the same thing maybe you don't
[1:00:06] understand fully but he's come for your
[1:00:09] deliverance this
[1:00:10] morning
[1:00:12] Hallelujah I tell you you're that kind
[1:00:14] of powerful people that no matter what
[1:00:16] comes against You Against All Odds
[1:00:19] you're going to express something that's
[1:00:21] been on the inside of you all the days
[1:00:23] of your life your daddy didn't give it
[1:00:25] to your mama didn't pass it on to you
[1:00:28] your preacher didn't pass it on to you
[1:00:30] but a jean Sheed of God awakened to the
[1:00:33] word and you got a hold of it and
[1:00:35] screamed Amen to the
[1:00:42] message Abraham against all ODS it was
[1:00:45] told to him he was going to have he's
[1:00:47] going to have an
[1:00:49] Isaac he told he's going to have an
[1:00:51] Isaac at 20 years
[1:00:53] old 30 years old at 40 years old there
[1:00:57] was something on the inside of him that
[1:00:59] was expressing that an Isaac was coming
[1:01:02] but it wasn't until mezc showed up 75 it
[1:01:05] was in him to express it at 90 it was in
[1:01:08] him to express it at 100 he saw the
[1:01:11] Fulfillment of it and maybe there has
[1:01:13] been a prophecy of the word of God that
[1:01:16] has been put over your life that you
[1:01:18] shall receive power after that the Holy
[1:01:21] Ghost has come upon you and now you're
[1:01:23] living in the reality of that moment
[1:01:26] as Jesus would say in John chapter
[1:01:29] 20 and he breathed on them the Holy
[1:01:33] Ghost it was a prophecy but it wasn't
[1:01:37] until they got up there in the upper
[1:01:38] room on the day of Pentecost that the
[1:01:41] prophecy became a reality and there they
[1:01:44] was expressing what Jesus had saw on the
[1:01:48] inside of them he saw a promise that was
[1:01:51] coming by their
[1:01:54] way you may not recognize this but I'm
[1:01:57] trying my best to get it to you but
[1:01:59] you're the most powerful people there is
[1:02:03] on the earth I'll take any of our 12y
[1:02:06] old
[1:02:07] girls any anybody 12 in here I know I
[1:02:09] got a daughter here at
[1:02:13] 12 I'll take any of these 12-y old girls
[1:02:17] and stack them up to the religions of
[1:02:19] the
[1:02:20] world and they can shut down politics
[1:02:23] they can shut down they can shut down
[1:02:25] government by the power that Reigns on
[1:02:27] the inside of them what is it it's the
[1:02:29] same power that was on the inside of
[1:02:31] Mary that she didn't even know that was
[1:02:33] there but it was lingering there but
[1:02:36] there come a time when she was going to
[1:02:38] express what everything that she'd been
[1:02:40] born for everything that she was desting
[1:02:42] for she was going to express when she
[1:02:45] was taking a walk there was something
[1:02:47] over her life all her days but when she
[1:02:51] met
[1:02:52] Gabriel when she met the messenger it
[1:02:55] Chang change her

[1:03:01] brother Brandon would say he would talk
[1:03:04] about that Cockney and recognizing it

[1:03:07] there he said I heard a story about an
[1:03:08] old Cockney he said there he was and he

[1:13:40] resurrection in life and he proved he
[1:13:42] was a Son of God he proved he was God in
[1:13:46] man brother B said you flip the chapter
[1:13:49] and you see Lazarus at a
[1:13:53] banquet you see Lazarus set a banquet
[1:13:56] brother B said these words I thought
[1:13:58] this so powerful he said and them people
[1:14:00] that came to that banquet they didn't
[1:14:02] come to see Jesus they come to see the
[1:14:05] power of
[1:14:07] Jesus oh maybe it came here with wrong
[1:14:10] intentions but you're seeing the power
[1:14:13] of my Jesus because there's a witness in
[1:14:15] this place there's a witness in this
[1:14:18] place you're at a banquet and the works
[1:14:21] of almighty God is in this room God
[1:14:23] delivers don't God sets free Tony
[1:14:34] he he's in this room he's here Elijah's
[1:14:39] God is
[1:14:40] [Applause]
[1:14:48] here we had that move come through
[1:14:51] called disbelieve the sign a bunch of
[1:14:53] defectors from the message
[1:14:55] walked
[1:14:57] away had some real hurts in it had some
[1:15:00] real hurts in it but God backed up his
[1:15:02] word every single time because God is
[1:15:05] obligated to his
[1:15:07] word my brother my brother Matthew he's
[1:15:11] not a man that's given over to
[1:15:12] imagination at
[1:15:14] all you want to hear the truth just ask
[1:15:16] my brother Matthew he'll tell you the
[1:15:18] truth it might hurt your feelings but
[1:15:20] he'll tell you the truth he's that kind
[1:15:22] of
[1:15:23] guy but there was a a group of
[1:15:26] disbelievers that had come against had
[1:15:28] to come against everything that you're
[1:15:29] here for this morning completely come
[1:15:32] against it my brother was was packing
[1:15:35] some notes that he'd gotten from you
[1:15:38] without
[1:15:40] understanding and he took it to him and
[1:15:42] said if you can't explain if you can't
[1:15:44] explain if you can't explain this then
[1:15:47] how can you you're going to have to turn
[1:15:48] if you turn down the message you're
[1:15:49] going to have to turn down the Bible
[1:15:51] told him exactly how you said it brother
[1:15:53] Donnie walked in there threw it down on
[1:15:56] table and they was all sitting in there
[1:15:57] a whole room of them you talking about
[1:15:59] walking into a room where the enemy's at
[1:16:02] he walked in there and Matthew ain't
[1:16:03] scared of
[1:16:04] nobody he ain't scared nobody it's
[1:16:06] probably it's probably one of his
[1:16:08] biggest
[1:16:10] weaknesses got me out of a lot of
[1:16:12] trouble as a
[1:16:14] boy thank you
[1:16:17] Matthew we walked in there threw it down
[1:16:20] on the page on the table they didn't
[1:16:22] want nothing to do with it cuz them
[1:16:24] people don't want Tru
[1:16:25] truth people don't want
[1:16:28] truth but it shows me how powerful that
[1:16:30] you are that you want this you've had
[1:16:34] critics come against it you've had
[1:16:36] squatters try to come in and take it
[1:16:38] from you but it shows me how powerful
[1:16:40] that you are Mason it's because there's
[1:16:43] something on the inside of you that's
[1:16:45] raising
[1:16:47] you to believe it against all hope
[1:17:01] he walked in there threw it down his
[1:17:04] house at that time was over in this such
[1:17:06] and such place he walked back over and
[1:17:07] Titus was a little big boy at that
[1:17:11] time him and Cassie sitting there in the
[1:17:13] room if y'all hear this God bless you
[1:17:17] but they're sitting there in the room
[1:17:19] they're sitting in the
[1:17:20] room Matthew walked in I he he he really
[1:17:25] he really guards this but I I think it's
[1:17:28] the time to say
[1:17:31] it he looked at Cash said if William
[1:17:33] brandham is not Malachi 4 then all the
[1:17:36] Bible's
[1:17:37] wrong at that moment the pillar of fire
[1:17:41] sweeped into the room and hung in the
[1:17:44] room right there these ain't people
[1:17:46] that's giving over to imaginations these
[1:17:48] are people that are real rugged
[1:17:50] Believers and in the face of criticism
[1:17:52] and in the face of it all God backed up
[1:17:55] his word what I'm saying to you young
[1:17:57] people is that no matter where you put
[1:18:00] this message it'll live put it in a
[1:18:03] dungeon and there'll be people praying
[1:18:05] for you over in John Mark's house and
[1:18:08] the angel of the Lord will come by your
[1:18:10] way Peter I get you out of the prison
[1:18:14] house do I have a witness in this
[1:18:18] place that God's still God he still
[1:18:21] loves me he's still on the throne he
[1:18:24] ain't forgot
