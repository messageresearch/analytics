[30:40] let's turn today if you would first
[30:42] Kings chapter 19 first Kings chapter 19
[30:48] let's read verse 2 I'm speak to you
[30:55] again
[30:55] today on mercy walked in and Jezebel
[31:02] sent a messenger unto Elijah saying so
[31:06] let the gods do to me and more also if I
[31:10] make not thy life as the life of one of
[31:13] them have a setting of this of course is
[31:15] that he's killed all of our preachers I
[31:17] mean prophets pretty rough past her to
[31:22] set under Lenin they don't preach art he
[31:25] carries a big sword knows how to use it
[31:28] - so Jezebel now is taken her threat
[31:31] Elijah the anointing he's out from under
[31:33] the anointing which is a terrible place
[31:35] for a preacher to be so she makes these
[31:38] threats if I'm making on bow life as the
[31:40] life of one of them about tomorrow about
[31:42] this time and when he saw that he arose
[31:46] and went for his life and came to ver
[31:50] Shiva which belongs to Judah and left
[31:53] his servant - but he himself went a
[31:56] day's journey into the wilderness and
[31:59] came and sat down under a juniper tree
[32:03] and requests it for himself that he
[32:06] might die and said it is enough now O
[32:09] Lord take away my life for I am NOT
[32:13] better than my father's I'd like to be
[32:17] remembered today as we pray also the
[32:22] church down in Manchester Tennessee
[32:25] where brother Carroll is a pastor there
[32:27] will be voting 11:30 our time probably
[32:30] before long for a pastor there so but
[32:34] the David Siler
[32:34] is there as well as some other brothers
[32:37] so we just want to pray that God's Will
[32:38] would be done today and let's just pray
[32:41] together over the word Heavenly Father
[32:44] we bring our needs before you today our
[32:49] lives our petitions father we're asking
[32:54] you to help us Lord Jesus as we look
[32:57] into your word we've gathered here as we
[33:00] do on Sunday mornings about this same
[33:03] time yet our needs are different than
[33:07] they were last week about this time
[33:09] others that are sick that wasn't sick
[33:11] within it others are facing things in
[33:14] their life that they wasn't facing last
[33:16] week a week ago even though these things
[33:19] may be surprises to us so not to you so
[33:22] we're asking that you would help us
[33:24] today you didn't promise this life would
[33:26] be easy but what you promised was that
[33:28] you would be with us and help us so
[33:32] we're asking Lord for every hand that
[33:33] was uplifted in the visible audience and
[33:35] those in the invisible audience that
[33:37] your presence would move for each one
[33:39] Lord I pray today that you would move
[33:43] Lord down in Manchester you see there
[33:45] but the Carol's going to be stepping
[33:47] down from the church there and several
[33:50] different ministers Lord their names
[33:52] have been brought up before the
[33:53] congregation and the congregation is
[33:55] going to vote and we're just asking Lord
[33:58] God that your will would be done we pray
[34:01] father that should help each individual
[34:02] there to be able to vote not as so much
[34:05] a political regime or the way this
[34:08] person would want them to or that one
[34:10] but Lord made a vote for the future of
[34:12] their church
[34:13] for the future of a godly assembly of a
[34:16] godly man a leader that you would choose
[34:19] Lord remember many many years ago father
[34:21] went to come here to for the people to
[34:24] vote on me coming Lord I was I was young
[34:26] and meaning them didn't know me very
[34:28] well Lord I was warned about coming here
[34:32] and even my closest friends if I asked
[34:34] me not to come but Lord God we look back
[34:37] and we realize mercy walked to him it
[34:41] was your grace maybe some of them wasn't
[34:43] even sure I'm not John know this guy and
[34:45] he's wild a buck he's crazies whatever
[34:49] but all of we believe that you worked it
[34:52] out and orchestrated it I mean oh you're
[34:55] still God today so we ask that you're a
[34:57] man would be put in there and as we
[34:59] approach the word we're asking that
[35:01] should help us today help me that I can
[35:03] get out of the way help me that I can be
[35:06] sensitive to the Holy Ghost Lord go
[35:09] arrest each of our salts bring him into
[35:12] the presence of Christ minister to every
[35:15] need father we ask in Jesus Christ's
[35:18] name Amen
[35:20] god bless you saying she may be seated
[35:30] mercy can
[35:33] take on many different forms when it
[35:36] goes to walking in the lives of
[35:37] individuals sometimes it has human feet
[35:41] sometimes it's invisible to the human
[35:44] eye it will walk in physically it will
[35:49] walk in spiritually it will walk into a
[35:52] situation or it may walk into a
[35:54] condition yet it's always always
[35:59] beneficial for those when God sends it
[36:02] we have one of the saddest settings of
[36:05] the Old Testament when we look at this
[36:08] setting today of Elijah the scripture
[36:11] doesn't go into the direct detail that
[36:13] we know from the inspiration of the
[36:16] message of the hour that Elijah has now
[36:19] entered into a breakdown he's now had a
[36:23] spiritual breakdown as well as a nervous
[36:27] breakdown mentally psychologically
[36:29] physically he's at his wits end he
[36:33] doesn't know what to do
[36:34] he stood under a great anointing anybody
[36:38] who's ever been under a very great
[36:40] anointing knows it while you're under
[36:42] that and anointing you feel like you can
[36:43] do anything absolutely anything you feel
[36:47] like you can challenge any demon you can
[36:49] do pretty much anything that needs to be
[36:52] done before you but when that anointing
[36:54] is gone you feel like a total different
[36:58] person it's very hard for me to explain
[37:00] how that actually feels I loved being
[37:03] under the anointing I loved come then
[37:05] wanting to preach I loved the anointing
[37:07] to study I was under most of the day
[37:10] yesterday by the time I came to church
[37:12] last night I felt physically exhausted
[37:14] because I've been under the anointing so
[37:17] long for so many hours yesterday with
[37:19] the Lord putting His Word together
[37:21] I love it when it's that way physically
[37:23] it was yell preaching is a different
[37:25] type praying for the sick is a different
[37:28] time but I must say and be honest before
[37:31] you today I've never stood where this
[37:33] man that we've read about was standing
[37:36] he had declared that God was gone he had
[37:40] taken a stand and very few men have ever
[37:42] to had to make as far as a national
[37:45] stand be under such scrutiny to be hated
[37:48] by so many by the leaders of the time he
[37:52] was the man that God had chosen for the
[37:54] hour so misunderstood he was a mystic he
[37:58] was odd unusual different now because he
[38:00] chose to be but because God made him
[38:03] different and now he's made this great
[38:05] stand the anointing has moved on him
[38:07] he's killed these prophets he's called
[38:09] fire down out of heaven God sent down
[38:11] the great consuming sign of the
[38:13] vindication of the pillar fire and God
[38:16] has proved what the man has said to be
[38:18] the truth now once that commission is
[38:21] done the anointing backs off because
[38:23] humanly we cannot live under that we
[38:26] cannot take that anointing it would kill
[38:28] us eventually it would kill you you're
[38:32] not made humanly to live under your mind
[38:34] your mind I think a man would lose his
[38:37] mind
[38:37] to stay under the anointing and evitt
[38:39] ibly you're physically you would do it
[38:42] absolutely die you cannot take it when
[38:44] John saw him on the Isle of Patmos John
[38:47] fell at his feet as a dead man for those
[38:50] who stood under the anointing very long
[38:52] at all you know how exhausting and what
[38:55] it does so God sends the anointing and
[38:58] then he will take it and back it off a
[39:01] little bit now this is where Elijah is
[39:03] he stands there in the face of these
[39:05] false prophets with the anointing on him
[39:08] nods does not bother him being
[39:11] outnumbered doesn't bother him he
[39:12] doesn't bat an eyes at work but as soon
[39:15] as the anointing is gone he feels so
[39:17] vulnerable the Prophet tells us that he
[39:20] runs at the threat of one woman one
[39:23] woman with the anointing he stands
[39:26] they're invincible without the anointing
[39:28] it seems as if though he's nothing but a
[39:30] mere child just a baby a child helpless
[39:34] it's standing there thinking how in the
[39:36] world what have I done and it's during
[39:38] these times that a person is so
[39:40] vulnerable and so open and Satan of
[39:43] course knows this very well so Elijah
[39:46] goes into an opposite direction actually
[39:48] he hears the threats from Jezebel his
[39:51] servant goes with him so far but even in
[39:53] that he separates himself from his
[39:56] servant so that even his sir
[39:58] will not be able to tell the direction
[40:01] that he's gone he's covering all these
[40:03] trails behind him he's leaving himself
[40:05] to where they there's not gonna be
[40:07] anyone to know where he's gone where no
[40:11] one can betray him you feel very
[40:12] vulnerable in this type of the place as
[40:15] he moves and goes there the farther he
[40:17] goes away from people and the longer he
[40:20] goes out from under the anointing the
[40:22] more vulnerable he becomes and thoughts
[40:24] enter into his mind what have you done
[40:26] you made a fool out of yourself
[40:28] here you are they're gonna kill you so
[40:31] now he comes through the only source
[40:33] that he has left and that is of course
[40:35] Joel though as he enters into the
[40:37] presence of God he's so low that he
[40:39] begins to ask God to take his life now
[40:42] once you notice he's not praying to
[40:44] Satan and asking Satan to do it but he's
[40:47] going still to his master and asking God
[40:50] to take his life because he says I'm no
[40:52] better than my father's and now you see
[40:55] where I'm at but you know God still had
[40:58] something left for this great man a man
[41:06] it might have seemed as if though he was
[41:09] at the end of the road and God was done
[41:11] with him and he'd never be used by God
[41:14] again and we've all been there in our
[41:16] lives maybe not quite where Elijah was
[41:18] but he's in this spot to where that God
[41:21] knows the man really needs help
[41:25] you know there's times when rebukes or
[41:28] what we need there's times from sharp
[41:31] chastisement is what we need and there's
[41:34] other times when we need an angel with a
[41:38] soft hand
[41:44] sometimes mercy will walk in and he will
[41:47] anoint a servant of God he will cut you
[41:50] up one side and down the other you look
[41:52] like you've just left a butcher shop
[41:54] when you leave Church but there's other
[41:57] times you look like you're wrapped in
[41:59] memory foam from the top of your head to
[42:02] the bottom of your feet you are
[42:04] cushioned you are cushioned with angelic
[42:08] touches and caresses so really it's not
[42:13] for us to be able to say how mercy will
[42:17] walk in mercy will come sometimes as a
[42:20] wrestler as we looked at Jacob last
[42:23] night when Jacob needed not so much the
[42:27] angel with the softest hand but he
[42:30] needed one with the wrestlers touch and
[42:32] our lives we will contemplate where we
[42:36] are and we said well god I'm going to
[42:38] church and I need this and this and this
[42:40] and you and I both know that many times
[42:42] what we thought we need what won't we
[42:44] got at all but you know what God knew
[42:47] what we needed even though we didn't
[42:49] know ourselves and that's why I've
[42:51] learned myself not to so set it up in
[42:54] the in our own minds well I want this
[42:56] and I need this and if I don't get it
[42:58] this way I ain't going back you're
[42:59] setting yourself up for a bad fall we
[43:02] need to go and say gods you know what I
[43:04] need I don't even know what I mean I
[43:06] think I need this and that and the other
[43:08] but I could be totally wrong so I'm
[43:11] asking you give me mercy Lord give me
[43:14] mercy and may that mercy walk into my
[43:17] situation in the way that you know that
[43:20] I need it in first Kings 19 5 as he lay
[43:25] and slept under a juniper tree behold
[43:36] then an angel touched him
[43:42] and said unto Him arise and eat but let
[43:56] me break in on the outside of the book
[44:00] of Kings and let me pull first Kings
[44:06] through a Malakoff for Elijah and let
[44:14] this Malecha for Elijah enlighten us to
[44:19] more of an understanding of first Kings
[44:24] the prophetess assists men who did on
[44:26] the supernatural say in the presence of
[44:28] God when you see God's program turned
[44:31] down and you preach it and you try your
[44:33] best and you do everything that God
[44:35] tells you to do and they still walk away
[44:38] from it it's heartbreaking God Almighty
[44:42] has done enough you're in the Angeles
[44:43] temple here this week till laussane just
[44:46] said Oh to set them afire no wonder he
[44:48] said it'll be more tolerable for Sodom
[44:50] and Gomorrah in the Day of Judgment oh
[44:52] man this poor little fella skinny laying
[44:55] there and his gray hair hanging over his
[44:58] shoulder and God said my servant needs
[45:01] some rest
[45:02] God's mercy to this serpent he just laid
[45:09] him down on a bunch of weeds and he went
[45:12] to sleep I imagine there was 10,000
[45:17] angels watching him sleep there's water
[45:21] surance
[45:22] that the believer has though the world
[45:25] turned him down yet God loves him the
[45:30] world may call you a Holy Roller they
[45:33] may call you a fanatic but if you're
[45:35] true to God there's one sure thing
[45:38] God loves you
[45:41] [Applause]
[45:43] and his angels are encamped about those
[45:47] who fear Him
[45:49] I'd imagine on every limb all around
[45:54] through the place were swarms of angels
[45:58] and God came down and he said mob poor
[46:01] little tired servant hey man he's so
[46:06] nervous and Torah he don't know what to
[46:10] do I want to pick out the angel standing
[46:15] here that has got the softest hands now
[46:23] if you would have been there that day
[46:25] and this was your prophet messenger of
[46:27] your day that you lived would you've
[46:29] been ashamed to have been identified
[46:31] with him would you would have looked at
[46:34] him and said you expect me to follow you
[46:36] and here you are running like a coward
[46:39] here you are asking God to kill you and
[46:42] you're the messenger and you expect me
[46:45] to follow you would you have given mercy
[46:49] or would you have give him harsh
[46:50] judgment all friends I want to see the
[46:54] way God sees I guarantee you one thing
[46:58] the greatest desire in my life is to see
[47:00] as God sees and this is probably one of
[47:02] my greatest failures as a mortal as
[47:05] sometimes I don't see the way God sees I
[47:07] want to look at people in the same
[47:09] understanding with the same insight with
[47:12] the same pool with the same mercy I want
[47:14] to give mercy to those whom he will
[47:16] extend mercy I want to be able to reach
[47:18] to those to whom he will reach through
[47:20] amen I want to say if he calls something
[47:23] darkness I want to say it's darkness if
[47:25] he offers mercy I want to extend mercy
[47:29] so God looks at him he said I don't want
[47:32] the angel with a bigger swell I want the
[47:34] angel or the biggest hand so he can bend
[47:36] him over I want the angel or the biggest
[47:38] knee so you can bend him over you mean
[47:40] way out but God said who among us got
[47:49] the softest hands
[47:52] what was it
[47:54] mercy love did who would ever sink the
[48:00] softest hand would be mercy sometimes a
[48:05] kind word can do more to drive away a
[48:08] demon than all the screamin and bottles
[48:11] of all and shouting and talking in
[48:13] tongues can ever do I want to pick out
[48:21] the angel standing here that's got the
[48:23] softest hands now listen what he tells
[48:25] the angel don't you scare him it shows
[48:33] in this nervous breakdown the least
[48:36] little thing tears him all to pieces
[48:40] just a little rustle in the weeds in the
[48:44] bushes could so Terry much so that angel
[48:48] had to approach him with such precaution
[48:51] and be so careful than what you scary
[48:56] walk over and stroke his brow right easy
[49:01] and I want the best cook among you what
[49:12] was it nurse walked in in the form of an

[54:59] goes back into this depression I may
[55:06] hear him say something like this the
[55:09] Lord your God bless you you've done your
[55:14] best done his best and yet run from
[55:23] Jezebel done his best and is depressed
[55:27] done his breast best and is so nervous
[55:30] he can't even set up done his best
[55:36] that's one of the best signs you've done
[55:38] your best most of people who do the best
[55:42] never think they do the best because
[55:44] their best they think is never best
[55:45] enough they're always looking for better
[55:48] and that's why Satan will use it against
[55:50] him most of you felt like you're a great
[55:52] success in life and everything you've
[55:54] done I sure don't I've been living for
[55:56] God since I was a little bitty boy I'm
[55:59] looking more my regrets I wish I'd have
[56:01] done that I wish they'd have done that
[56:02] now look at I'm Here I am an old man
[56:03] most of my life has already done and
[56:06] gone what can I do now I can I go back
[56:09] and redo any of it I cannot and now my
[56:11] strength is gone as a young man my
[56:13] vitality is gone as a young man so what
[56:16] do I do am I going to wallow and say
[56:18] well I could have done that I wish I'd
[56:20] have done that I wish out a down there
[56:22] our journey on our journey arm at the
[56:26] end of every day I lay down on my bed
[56:28] Lord God I've done the best
[56:30] I could I'm immortal I fell short this
[56:32] day I made mistakes but lord I love you
[56:35] with all of my heart I pray all of my
[56:38] mistakes and my shortcomings are washed
[56:41] in the blood of the Lord Jesus father
[56:43] over all I'll feel like I have done my
[56:47] best of synthy science for a witness and
[56:57] the day of judgment they'll stand alone
[56:58] you done just what I told you to do I
[57:01] know you're tired and weary now and the
[57:04] Lord God created of heavens and earth
[57:05] has sent me to feed you this bread and
[57:07] this water you had to rub in his eyes
[57:10] and raise enough little frail shaking
[57:13] hands took ahold of the bread need it
[57:15] just then the great angelic choir came
[57:18] out and formed a little panoramic around
[57:20] him like that and began to sing the
[57:22] songs like no mother could COO her baby
[57:26] to sleep so he too sort of hoecake with
[57:30] all these vitamins and drink this little
[57:32] water and God sent the end gel it quiet
[57:34] come out and what did he do he needed
[57:36] sleep again folks who get depressed
[57:39] that's the way they do they don't have
[57:40] the energy to go do this and that and
[57:42] the other and they sleep a lot a lot of
[57:44] them and they just don't feel like they
[57:46] have nothing to live for and he comes
[57:48] God doesn't rebuke him because it
[57:50] doesn't instantly drive away he knows he
[57:52] needs several hoecakes and several doses
[57:54] of water amen
[57:59] sometimes you come in your you ain't
[58:01] ready for church one song don't lift you
[58:04] up out of where you are
[58:05] sometimes you need another sometimes you
[58:07] need another hey man but he's laughing
[58:11] he's merciful he's kind to us to give us
[58:14] what we need let him sleep again mother
[58:17] father turned around and said you know
[58:18] how I love him so much and the journey's
[58:21] great he's got to go so a lot yet I'm
[58:23] not gonna go through with him but I must
[58:25] feed him again so he called the angels
[58:27] and dumped in another big bundle of
[58:30] vitamins and cooked up another corn cake
[58:35] that's what I'm doing here this moon

[59:34] God then he finds the cave way back in
[59:37] the wilderness and the first thing you
[59:39] know God found him back in there oh my
[59:42] he called to him that there was a
[59:43] rushing wind through that tore up the
[59:45] mountain The Rock's ran and fell down
[59:47] Elijah just set and listened and there
[59:51] came a shaking in an earthquake that
[59:52] shook the mountain but Elijah said still
[59:55] and then come the fire fell lightning
[59:58] flash Elijah sit still then a still
[1:00:01] small voice spoke and allowed to answer
[1:00:04] he wrapped his mantle over his face and
[1:00:07] walked out I just wonder if we haven't
[1:00:10] listened too much to the rushing mighty
[1:00:12] wind and the fire and the blood and
[1:00:15] everything else and it failed to hear
[1:00:17] that still small voice wonder if we will
[1:00:23] look so much to the gifts that we can't
[1:00:25] see the giver mercy walk down
[1:00:37] pal mercy becomes incarnate and this
[1:00:43] same man first King 17/8 and the word of
[1:00:49] the Lord came unto him saying arise get
[1:00:53] thee to Zaire pass which belongeth to
[1:00:56] Sidon and dwell there and behold I have
[1:00:59] commanded a widow woman there to sustain
[1:01:03] thee the mystery about this is she
[1:01:06] didn't know it yet so he arose and went
[1:01:16] to Sara pass and when he came to the
[1:01:17] gate of the city behold a widowed woman
[1:01:18] was there gathering the cross for the
[1:01:23] six and he called to her and said fetch
[1:01:26] me I pray thee a little water in the
[1:01:28] vessel that I may drink and if she was
[1:01:33] going to fetch it he called to her and
[1:01:35] say bring me I pray thee a morsel of
[1:01:38] bread in Vanhanen she said as the Lord
[1:01:42] died God liveth I have not a cake but a
[1:01:46] handful of meal and a barrel and a
[1:01:49] little all in the crus and behold I am
[1:01:51] gathering two sticks but I may go in and
[1:01:54] dress it for me and my son that we may
[1:01:57] eat it and die but mercy is going to ask
[1:02:06] her for everything she has
[1:02:12] you see friends if we're not careful
[1:02:14] mercy will be right in our own life
[1:02:16] moving in ways that we don't comprehend
[1:02:18] and understand it because we've got our
[1:02:20] mindset
[1:02:21] we'll miss mercy mercy may ask you for
[1:02:24] some of you think I can't do it I can't
[1:02:26] give it if you'll give it mercy will
[1:02:28] give back to you who I just said unto
[1:02:34] her fear not going do as thou has said

[1:23:57] got somebody even some manners about him
[1:23:59] close it out with a leathern girl and
[1:24:01] camels her and rougher no cop would you
[1:24:07] identify to that as mercy if you select
[1:24:10] you would

[1:24:15] Luke 1:26 the six month the angel
[1:24:18] Gabriel was sent from God into a city of
[1:24:20] Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin
[1:24:22] espoused to a man whose name of Joseph
[1:24:24] for the house of David and the Virgin's
[1:24:25] name was Mary and the angel came in unto
[1:24:29] her and said hail thou art highly
[1:24:30] favoured the Lord is with thee blessed
[1:24:32] art thou among women and when she saw
[1:24:35] him she was troubled at his saying and
[1:24:37] cast in her mind what manner of
[1:24:38] salutation this should be and the angel
[1:24:41] said unto her fear not Mary for thou
[1:24:42] hast found favor with God
[1:24:44] and behold thou shalt conceive in thy
[1:24:46] womb and bring forth a son and thou
[1:24:49] shalt call his name Jesus Mercy Mercy
[1:24:55] Mercy o the coming of the Holy Ghost and
[1:25:02] that's Chapter two
[1:25:03] what was it mercy walked in the upper
[1:25:06] room in the form of licks of fire when I
[1:25:10] say walks into your into your experience
[1:25:12] into your dilemma into your war it
[1:25:15] doesn't always mean that it's a man or a
[1:25:16] woman boy or girl it can be in the form
[1:25:19] of supernatural in this case it was a
[1:25:21] pillar of fire dividing himself but
[1:25:23] mercy walked in Peter found out that he
[1:25:25] had failed and walking with the Lord
[1:25:27] Jesus he found out that he had been a
[1:25:29] miserable failure as did John and all
[1:25:31] the rest of them but mercy walked in was
[1:25:33] what a new verse mercy walked in not
[1:25:37] another not another theology not with
[1:25:40] another quote from the Lord Jesus one
[1:25:42] that they'd forgotten this quote would
[1:25:44] help him to be overcomers he walked in
[1:25:46] with a new verse may I say to you today
[1:25:48] for many of you mercy walked into you
[1:25:51] one day when you were sitting in a
[1:25:53] church somewhere maybe you'd been around
[1:25:55] for a long long time but all of a sudden
[1:25:57] the spoken word open your soul and the
[1:26:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost moved off of
[1:26:02] your spirit right down into your soul
[1:26:04] and you got birth setting right there
[1:26:06] hearing the word mercy walked in mercy
[1:26:10] woke it
[1:26:12] she walked into your soul your body will
[1:26:14] walk out change Acts chapter 3 verse 1
[1:26:24] Peter and John went up together to the
[1:26:26] temple the--how her prayer being the
[1:26:29] night there and a certain man lame from
[1:26:31] his mother's womb was carried whom they
[1:26:35] laid daily at the gate of the temple
[1:26:37] which is called beautiful to ask alms of
[1:26:40] them that entered into the temple who
[1:26:42] soui seeing Peter and John about to run
[1:26:44] to the temple asked an Almond Peter
[1:26:46] fasting his eyes upon him was John said
[1:26:49] look on us and he gave heed unto them
[1:26:52] expecting to receive something he was
[1:26:58] expecting to receive something that is
[1:26:59] going to be receiving something that he
[1:27:01] hadn't expected and what he had expected
[1:27:03] he wasn't gonna get hey man that's
[1:27:10] probably the way show me y'all here
[1:27:11] today say man I'm going to church to get
[1:27:12] this not noting God's giving you all
[1:27:14] kinds of things you didn't expect to get
[1:27:17] then Peter said silver and gold have I
[1:27:20] none but such as I have give out there
[1:27:22] in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[1:27:25] what happened mercy walked in in the
[1:27:29] form of John and Peter mercy speaks to
[1:27:32] this lame man and tells the lame man to
[1:27:34] do what rise up and mercy walked in he
[1:27:41] walked
[1:27:44] Lord God mercy walked in but what if he
[1:27:49] had managed it I'll tell one thing if
[1:27:50] you came give me this and not in the
[1:27:52] other I don't want what else you got he
[1:27:54] had an open heart he might have been
[1:27:55] disappointed financially but he wasn't
[1:27:58] disappointed leg wise why mercy walked
[1:28:01] in he took him by the right hand and
[1:28:06] lifted him up immediately his feet and
[1:28:09] ankle bones received strength and he's
[1:28:13] setting down went to sleep and realize
[1:28:18] he leaping leaping stood up have you
[1:28:26] ever tried that
[1:28:29] leaping standing up now you're flat on
[1:28:33] the ground
[1:28:34] he don't just he leaps up from a sitting
[1:28:45] position mercy walked in he leaped out
[1:28:59] couple more clothes a good sister in the
[1:29:05] Apostolic Church passed away acts 936
[1:29:10] there was that job a certain disciple
[1:29:12] named Tabitha which was my
[1:29:13] interpretation called Dorcas this woman
[1:29:16] was full of good works and alms deeds
[1:29:17] which she did came to pass in those days
[1:29:19] she was sick and died and when they had
[1:29:22] washed later in an upper chamber for as
[1:29:24] much as litter was not to Joppa and the
[1:29:26] disciples had heard that Peter was there
[1:29:27] they sent it to him to me and desiring
[1:29:29] him that he would not delay to come to
[1:29:31] him Peter rose and wetlands him when he
[1:29:34] was calm they brought him into the upper
[1:29:35] chamber and all the widows stood by and
[1:29:37] weeping it showing the coats and the
[1:29:39] garments which Dorcas had made or she
[1:29:41] was with them but Peter put them all
[1:29:44] force and kneeled down and prayed and
[1:29:47] turned him notice not to Dorcas but to
[1:29:52] the body in it amazing Luke does not
[1:29:59] call the body
[1:30:00] Dorcas the body is only Dorcas when
[1:30:06] Dorcas is in it whoa here goes another
[1:30:11] series OMA
[1:30:13] but when Dorcas leaves the body that's
[1:30:15] what it is the body so he turns to the
[1:30:20] body and said so speaking to the body
[1:30:31] now the body is not a bizarre wherever
[1:30:36] Tabitha is just fixing a cross home in
[1:30:40] the sixth dimension maybe already there
[1:30:41] just got right across the river and
[1:30:43] she's running to him through the tall
[1:30:44] blue grass as she's walking down through
[1:30:46] gathering with her people but all of a
[1:30:49] sudden mercy called her name from across
[1:30:52] the river
[1:30:58] tabatha arise and say opened her eyes
[1:31:03] and when she saw not Jesus she said and
[1:31:19] he gave her his hand and lifted her up
[1:31:22] and when he had called the Saints and
[1:31:24] widows presented her alive she walked in
[1:31:29] in the form of Peter Peter and toss up
[1:31:41] Acts chapter 10 verse 1 a certain man
[1:31:43] and since the real call corniest
[1:31:45] accentuated the band called the Italian
[1:31:47] band a devout man one that feared God
[1:31:48] with all his house which gave much alms
[1:31:50] to the people and prayed to God always
[1:31:52] so in a vision evidently about the ninth
[1:31:54] hour of the day an angel of God coming
[1:31:56] in to him and sing unto him Cornelius
[1:31:58] and when he looked on him he was afraid
[1:32:00] and said what is it Lord and he said to
[1:32:02] him by prayers and that arms are come up
[1:32:04] for a memorial before God the Gentile
[1:32:08] Roman soldier in the meantime God's name
[1:32:14] was Simon Peter over in another city
[1:32:16] chapter 10 verse 21 then Peter went down
[1:32:19] to the men which were sent to him from
[1:32:20] corn ears and said behold I am him whom
[1:32:22] you seek what is the cause where of your
[1:32:24] calm and they said Cornelius the
[1:32:25] Centurion a just man one that fears God
[1:32:27] and a good rapport among all the nations
[1:32:30] of the Jews was warned from God by Holy
[1:32:31] Angel to sin for the end of this house
[1:32:34] ended amazing an angel of God told him
[1:32:36] to go get Peter why didn't the angel
[1:32:37] preach to him God don't break his word
[1:32:40] new bursts come through the body
[1:32:46] then call he them and love salmon on the
[1:32:49] morrow Peter wanna wave us and then
[1:32:51] certain brethren from Joppa company him
[1:32:53] and the morrow after they entered into
[1:32:55] seseri and Cornelius waited for them and
[1:32:57] call together his kinsmen and their
[1:32:59] friends and his Peter was coming in
[1:33:01] Cornelius met him and fell down at his
[1:33:03] feet and worship him but this is a true
[1:33:10] man of God but Peter took him up saying
[1:33:13] stand up I myself also am a man
[1:33:23] mercy walked in and it was so
[1:33:25] overwhelming this man bowels as he feels
[1:33:27] mercy verse 44 while Peter yet spake
[1:33:34] these words the Holy Ghost fell on all
[1:33:38] them which heard the word and they of
[1:33:40] the circumcision which believed were
[1:33:43] astonished they couldn't believe you
[1:33:46] dogs got the Holy Ghost the way they got
[1:33:48] it
[1:33:48] mercy walked in they walked out changed
[1:33:55] let me close Jesus preached the gospel
[1:34:01] the Apostles preached it wonderful
[1:34:04] things that happened the year is now in
[1:34:07] 96 ad many things have happened great
[1:34:10] transformations but there's still
[1:34:14] something that needs to happen after the
[1:34:15] cross hands way back to God he's been
[1:34:21] purchased but he still doesn't have the
[1:34:23] clear understanding verified to him of
[1:34:26] his inheritance
[1:34:30] so God on the outer premise comes down
[1:34:34] indeed him with his servant John John
[1:34:36] felt like he was put there to die but
[1:34:41] mercy walked here
[1:34:45] revelation 5:1 and I saw on the right
[1:34:48] hand of him that sat on the throne a
[1:34:49] book written within and on the backside
[1:34:52] see with seven seals and I saw a strong
[1:34:55] angel proclaiming with a loud voice who
[1:34:57] is worthy to open the book and to loose
[1:34:59] the seals thereof and no man in heaven
[1:35:02] no one else'll under the earth was able
[1:35:04] to open the book neither to look thereon
[1:35:06] and I where much o would be lost and yet
[1:35:12] now the cross has already come the Lord
[1:35:14] Jesus has already come his blood has
[1:35:16] already been shed John knows this but
[1:35:19] now God is tie the excelling of the
[1:35:21] revelation on over into the church ages
[1:35:23] that this is what may be a possible John
[1:35:26] I went much because no man was found
[1:35:32] worthy to open and to read the book
[1:35:37] neither to look thereon look mercy and
[1:35:46] one beholder saith unto me wait not
[1:35:48] behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:35:49] the root of David hath prevailed to open
[1:35:51] the book and to loose the seven seals
[1:35:52] and behold I beheld and lo in the midst
[1:35:56] of the Shonan the four beasts in the
[1:35:57] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[1:36:01] had been slaved over to God
[1:36:04] where'd he come from John looked out
[1:36:05] right prior to that won't he come from
[1:36:07] mercy won't do you imagine John looking
[1:36:11] away for a moment may be white but his
[1:36:12] eyes Oh God we're all lost Oh God
[1:36:15] we can never come to inheritance and
[1:36:17] when he turns and he looked back there
[1:36:18] he was where any time from proceeded out
[1:36:20] the very heart of God himself
[1:36:22] not another being not another God not
[1:36:24] another man the same man mercy
[1:36:34] let's jump down but they're the malachi
[1:36:38] forward will close to this 2,000 years
[1:36:43] of church ages the darkness had clouded
[1:36:47] our perception the word had come to so
[1:36:50] so many cycles of revivals and wound up
[1:36:53] in the same time and such a mess God
[1:36:56] said in Malachi 4:5 behold I'll send you
[1:36:58] Elijah the Prophet before the coming in
[1:37:00] the great dreadful day of the Lord and
[1:37:01] he shall turn the heart of the father's
[1:37:03] to the children and the heart of the
[1:37:04] children to the father's lest I come and
[1:37:07] smite the earth with a curse if Elijah
[1:37:10] don't come the earth will be damned
[1:37:17] people can life they can really kill
[1:37:20] they can make fun or they want to the
[1:37:23] sending of Elijah was the mercy
[1:37:33] maybe you found a book somewhere a tape
[1:37:37] maybe somebody told you about it maybe
[1:37:41] others are sitting there with him and
[1:37:42] they tell us that you're crazy here nuts
[1:37:44] but to you
[1:37:45] merci longtail and maybe he's already
[1:37:52] saved but just a saved blonde man or a
[1:37:56] blonde save man didn't understand the
[1:37:59] Godhead you don't understand nothing
[1:38:00] else no you know why she's safe she's
[1:38:01] lost but mercy walked in and God told
[1:38:05] the seals away from your own life that's
[1:38:07] what as they did from the mystery of God
[1:38:10] mercy now bring it on them some you men
[1:38:20] was looking for a companion news there

[1:38:27] you met a little dark-eyed dark-haired
[1:38:29] girl God in the form of that little lady
[1:38:33] mercy walked in your life maybe some of
[1:38:38] your sister's looking for a man looking
[1:38:39] for us but a mate you talked to this guy

[1:38:54] brown haired lady there I snot when we
[1:38:57] went home sitting at the table I say one
[1:39:01] day God allowed mercy to walk in mouth

[1:39:16] power packed as the angelic formula but
[1:39:18] they are wonderful she takes her kind

[1:39:32] that day as I get my reward I want to
[1:39:35] stand there when she gets hers
[1:39:37] [Applause]
[1:39:51] as they journey down deeper and deeper
[1:39:54] and deeper into the cave it was darker
[1:39:57] and darker all of a sudden the man
[1:40:00] reaches over and turns off the light and
[1:40:05] the little girl standing not too far
[1:40:06] from him screams to the top of her voice
[1:40:09] it's so dark it's so dark
[1:40:12] but her little brother standing near the
[1:40:14] man who turned off the light said fear

[1:40:33] whole world is pressing against us we
[1:40:36] don't know exactly what will lay before
[1:40:38] us but mercy will walk in it it may
[1:40:43] start just this new way and you're at
[1:40:46] the sink brushing your teeth in the
[1:40:47] morning you're fixing to go to work
[1:40:49] you're doing through your regular
[1:40:50] routine you're gonna stop at Dunkin and
[1:40:52] get your favorite coffee your favorite
[1:40:54] doughnut you know whatever it is this

[1:40:58] meet the biz the office guy you've got
[1:40:59] to do this that the other but all of a
[1:41:02] sudden well you've got your head down
[1:41:04] brushing teeth spitting out the
[1:41:06] toothpaste a young man steps in your
[1:41:09] room and you realize it's your father
[1:41:15] but how is it he's younger than you are
[1:41:19] the resurrection is saying
[1:41:22] merci walked here it may be your husband
[1:41:27] that's been gone for 10 years or 40 or a
[1:41:29] daughter or son whatever more mercy will
[1:41:33] walk into your home while it's happening
[1:41:35] to you in Johnson City Elizabeth and is
[1:41:37] happening in Nigeria as the Saints there
[1:41:40] were awakened out of their sleep and
[1:41:42] they felt this strange presence in the
[1:41:44] room and they looked over on the wall
[1:41:45] and there stood a former pastor mercy
[1:41:49] walked in don't you want to be ready
[1:41:54] friends
[1:41:55] [Music]
[1:41:57] praise God Heavenly Father thank you
[1:42:05] Lord Jesus for your word and all last
[1:42:10] night and today have been very simple
[1:42:11] but I'll thank you for it Lord and its
[1:42:15] simplicity it has been so profound I
[1:42:18] think you dear God I'm sure each of us
[1:42:23] here today our needs would be so
[1:42:26] different some Lord they may need mercy
[1:42:31] in that angel with a soft hand others
[1:42:35] might need it in the form of correction
[1:42:37] maybe they need a spanking as which say
[1:42:40] others might need that upper room
[1:42:43] experience no doubt some here need mercy
[1:42:47] to step in in healing over to think of
[1:42:50] sister Chiyo Fleeman today fighting this
[1:42:53] terrible disease and her body brother
[1:42:54] toss and yet Lord also realized or God
[1:43:01] sometimes when our journey is finished
[1:43:05] hallelujah and Satan is allowed to
[1:43:08] achieve his life's goal against us and
[1:43:12] that is to bring us down to the point of
[1:43:14] death and our loved one is suffering and
[1:43:17] struggling to breathe and we finally
[1:43:21] come to a place to where we accept it it
[1:43:23] looks like they're going to cross over
[1:43:26] we believe mercy steps in that room and
[1:43:32] carries them across the river well it
[1:43:36] breaks our hearts and we cry we feel so
[1:43:39] sad that they're gone
[1:43:40] but in reality if we could have a
[1:43:43] glimpse just for a few moments of those
[1:43:47] who crossed over Lord I think in the
[1:43:49] last little bit how many that we've had
[1:43:51] to cross over nor the Warrens sister
[1:43:54] Stephanie others that no doubt will
[1:43:57] follow the Lord if we could call him
[1:44:00] back today they wouldn't come back to
[1:44:02] this world for nothing
[1:44:04] because mercy stepped in for the final
[1:44:06] time they boarded the train of deaths as
[1:44:09] we would call it of the ship of death
[1:44:12] but they had the ticket in their hand
[1:44:14] their destination was the sixth
[1:44:17] dimension so death couldn't keep them
[1:44:20] long it's only a moment of time really
[1:44:23] they step in and their eyes shut across
[1:44:25] the channel of death as soon as they get
[1:44:29] across there's a loved one a mama daddy
[1:44:31] a brother sister the Prophet whoever it
[1:44:33] is standing down at the river waving
[1:44:36] their hands screaming as it was to the
[1:44:39] top of their voices welcome welcome
[1:44:44] your journey is over mercy walked him
[1:44:52] oh god I really hope each of us today
[1:44:56] minister to us Lord according to your
[1:44:59] abundant mercy and kindness
[1:45:02] how many hasn't need today before the
[1:45:05] Lord but you just raise your hand to God
[1:45:08] there's no one looking around now you
[1:45:09] just hold that need in your heart praise
[1:45:14] God
[1:45:15] I've got so many folks that are sick
[1:45:17] this flu and all these things that are
[1:45:19] going around and we're going to pray for
[1:45:21] them but I want to pray for you too is
[1:45:23] your need whatever it is before the Lord
[1:45:27] Hemme believes today what you've heard
[1:45:30] the truth you think God loves you as
[1:45:32] much as he did Elijah maybe you're
[1:45:35] feeling depressed the way he was in that
[1:45:37] day and somehow if Satan can convince
[1:45:39] you that in your depression that means
[1:45:41] you're less of a Christian that is a lie
[1:45:43] that is a lie God loves you just as much
[1:45:48] when you're depressed as he does when
[1:45:51] you're on the mountain he loves you when
[1:45:54] you have issues he loves you when you're
[1:45:58] not doing so good he loves you and he
[1:46:01] wants to help you Father before we close
