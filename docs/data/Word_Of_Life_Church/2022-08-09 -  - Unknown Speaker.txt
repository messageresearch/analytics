come with this time take the service glad to be here too the ram said that questions and answers can be a little bit treacherous but thankfully we didn't have no treacherous ones in this batch so maybe we can just stand together and we'll we'll pray and ask the lord to help us anybody like to be remembered tonight as we pray just raise your hand with your requests in your heart heavenly father as we've assembled here tonight lord we're still just so grateful for the service that you gave us yesterday your presence was so wonderful and so awesome lord your people responding into that presence i just been thinking about it all day how great it was i can't imagine what it's going to be like when we get there that day father we never have to leave that presence we'll be in that forever but we're here tonight for a better understanding of the things of life lord this is what we're going to deal with tonight is questions from the hearts of these young people things they don't understand or direction that they're looking for in life i pray that you would help me lord you see my heart you know i never ever want to mislead or misdirect one's soul i know i have a lot to answer for at that day i pray that you would help me lord that i would only give that which is pleasing to you bless our time together we pray father in the name of the lord jesus amen god bless you you may be seated i thought it might be a little bit better for us if i would uh have the the questions and then uh put it up on the on the board here or the screen rather behind me and then the scriptures and quotes and things that i'll use as well so it would help you to be able to read them i normally study in microsoft word and then i will make a pdf file and send it to my ipad so today i had the bright idea of just sending that pdf file to the brother so they had to totally redo it so hopefully it's going to be legible where you can be able to rig it so brother josiah was really working hard up here to get it get it going so here's the first question that we'd like to look at tonight how do you know when god is leading you to do something now this is not something that just pertains to young people as a matter of fact all of us all through our life will be faced with this answer and this question of how can we know when god is leading us in a certain way and we know one thing for sure that god will never lead us contrary to his word but when god gave us the word he didn't tell us the answer to absolutely every decision that we would ever make and god did that for a reason he could have handed you the book of your life when you were born and said now on this day you'll be facing this on this day you'll be facing that and when you do do this and then tomorrow you'll be facing that and when you do do this he could give you every day of your life but that would have made him so impersonal so he give us the things that he determined was necessary and essential in the word and then he gave us preachers that would come of course and be able to preach to us but he left an element of that to where that it would require you and myself to go to him in prayer and petition him and ask him lord what should i do i don't know what to do about this or that or the other but let's start tonight with the book of romans chapter 12 verse 2 and paul says be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of god i love the way that he describes what the will of god is that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of god now we know that god has two aspects to his will one is a permissive will and the other one is his perfect will we are living as far as our natural births by the permissive will never never did god want for us to be born between a man and a woman the way we are but yet god has allowed it to be so and he will work it in to make it fit into his perfect will so how do we know when god is leading us to do something it will always always bring him glory and credit and honor now this this is a very broad spectrum in that it covers your job your vocation the man or woman you're going to marry the place that you might live the church you will go to it will cover every aspect of your life after you're born again and you receive the holy ghost and then you are led by god to the mate that god wants you to have this will be one of the most important things that you'll ever understand about god how to find his will now i don't mind telling you as a preacher i know for myself sometimes the will of god seems like it's so evasive and you search for it and you search and you pray and you ask him and there's times to where that you will do your very best and it seems like it just doesn't work out do i wish it was easier sometimes i do but i figure i'm probably more lazy than what i am because if god just give us that answer as soon as we ask him for it we would be more spoiled and we would expect everything so much faster so sometimes he wants us to actually feel somewhat of a burden notice again in romans 15 32 that paul said that i may come unto you with joy by the will of god and may with you be refreshed so here is a church aids messenger a prophet and he was desiring to be able to go somewhere and to be able to preach to the children of god but he wanted to make sure that it was the will of god and colossians chapter 4 verse 12 he mentions another brother here whose name is ephras which is one of you a servant of christ saluteth you always laboring fervently now listen what this brother's call was laboring fervently for you in prayers so we don't have a record that this guy was a preacher we don't have any record that he wanted out being a missionary but his labor of what he the way he labored for the kingdom of god was he labored for the saints of god in prayer what a great thing and this is what he prayed that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of god now this is what i find amazing about the will of god that a person may find the right mate totally in the will of god they might find the right job totally in the will of god but they may get in their mind they want to live and say this city versus that city and when they move they totally miss the will of god for that part of their life why no church there no place for them to be able to raise up their children and their family in the right kind of setting to where god wanted them to be so it's amazing that the will of god is not branches on a tree that there's so many aspects to it okay i'm married the right man or the right woman and i'm a christian i'm filled with the holy ghost i know that's the will of god and i'm called to believe the message i believe that's the will of god for my life but yeah i got this idea that i wanted to move to chicago because i've always thought it'd be a great place to live so i want i just want to go there but why do you want to go well i just do i just i just think that would be a great place to live in the will of god in the will of god in the will of god out of the will of god now what's amazing is that that one step out of the will of god can reflect every other aspect that we're in the will of god and pleasing to him so it's it's quite complicated and it's almost like that god allowed it to be in such a way that we as his people would realize we need him so desperately every day of our life because he knows how we are as humans the very best of us will make the wrong choice notice john says in first john chapter 2 verse 17 and the world passeth away and the lust thereof now listen how important that the will of god is but he that does the will of god abide us forever now i wonder how many of us here tonight might be praying about the will of god for a certain thing in our life a certain aspect what many of you are probably no doubt many of that are out out streaming now look at this question again how do you know when god is leading you to do something this is one thing i love about question answers and i'm going to give you one from question answers 1961 how do you feel is the best way to find the lord's will in some important matters i'll tell you dear friend the best way to find the will of god in some important matters is prayer see here's a wonderful little thing if you have a matter that's very important now here's the way i do it i take it before the lord and it's always been my strengths i find this amazing because he didn't say his strengths was being a prophet he didn't say that even his strength was being a preacher or being a pastor but his strengths was finding that he could go to god in prayer and find direction about whatever it was that he was facing i wait upon the lord and see what he says and i just let myself neutral neutral oh how hard this is i let myself neutral to it and don't take either side so you're praying about a certain thing to do in your life if you're honest you'll probably be like me most of us will have an inclination or a desire or a certain side that we want to take now i really believe this is the will of the lord for me to do this now god you just work it out lord that this will be your will we're not praying in neutral we're praying with our minds already made up now if if the will of god was not already difficult enough to find whenever we move out of neutral and we reach over and grab ahold of the gear shift and we pull it down and drive and we've got our foot on the gas at the same time we do it and we are out of here we are convinced i i know i know this is the will of god and this is why we make mistakes it's because we leave out the simple approach to neutrality you see neutrality is so important to god and he knows how opposite that it is to our human nature now it doesn't mean that we're horrible people because we have a certain inclination or a certain desire well i'm hoping this is what god wants i really really hope this is what he wants he knows how we feel and i believe the lord jesus as a man no doubt felt the exact same way about certain things you say how could you say that in the garden of gethsemane if it be thy will let this cut pass for me jesus did not want to die as a man he did not even want to leave his disciples knowing he was going away as a man he did not want to become a curse in the eyes of almighty god so he when he prayed he leaned toward a certain answer but notice the neutrality how powerful that it was nevertheless not my will but i will be done now you see that's not wrong even the lord jesus asked and he prayed a prayer that he knew was not going to be answered if it be thy will let this cup pass from me but at the end of every bit of it his amen was i'm still neutral father and that's what i want now watch how brother branham emphasizes this he said i just let myself neutral to it and i don't take either side saying the heavenly father notice now how he brings this to us of course now in my case most of the time he said if it's very important i'll wait on a vision well that excludes most of us because most of us don't have visions right we don't have visions but many people god doesn't deal with in vision so therefore i wouldn't advise you to do that but because it's some people that has visions and some that's something else where do you see something else that i couldn't do maybe in your way of serving the lord i do something that you couldn't do and god deals with us different so if i was in your place and didn't have visions from before the lord i would wait upon the lord and say lord now you show me what's the decision to make and then the way you feel led then just wait a little bit oh okay now wait a minute so i pray and then i feel that a certain way i don't move immediately i still wait isn't this amazing satan would love for us to be so afraid of missing the will of god that he causes us to jump ahead of the will of god out of what he wants to describe to us as a godly fear now hope you understand what i'm fixing to say god does not he does not hate us god does not get angry at us when we try how we feel led because sometimes it's nothing but the devil leading us well praise the lord that made you all mad now but if we all would be honest i'm sure that we've all felt led to do certain things and it panned out it was not the lord that led us i told the brothers a while ago me apparently sending that file to them in the pdf format format rather i'll just say what some of you say the devil made me do it it definitely wasn't the lord because it caused them all kinds of difficulty and trouble now notice what he said then the way you feel led to do it then wait a little bit and then wait a little while longer wow what a peculiar way to approach the will of god so you're praying and you think you have an answer so you don't move you wait a little bit and then you wait a little while longer but how fast whenever we sing we are led to do something and we jump immediately and then a month later six months later we look back and think dear lord what have i done why we didn't wait we were so afraid we would miss the will of god don't you understand how satan works on us as humans he takes our converted desire and he will play with our minds with that very thing you better do it you better do it you're going to get in trouble god's going to get you no this is what god's prophet taught us you're never going to do wrong by obeying what you're taught now notice he said so which side you lean toward say now father in my heart you know it doesn't matter wow no that's hard to say but i want to know here's the key though i want to know what you want to do about it now this is neutrality again this is the power of neutrality most of us think of neutrality as being powerless we've got it all wrong being neutral is such a powerful wonderful thing now listen he said that's the way i do about meeting sometimes i feel kind of led to go this way or that way then i follow that way that's the way to do it because it's in prayer then and you're doing the best that you can now i believe this as paul friends he said as paul said in the new testament and days gone by he was between two straights which way he should go and he started on the wrong road and he got a macedonian call now you imagine here's a prophet messenger and he makes a decision to go a certain certain way say he's going to go preach at a certain city but it was the wrong call he the lord no no no no no paul no don't don't don't go there and then he sees these people in this dreamer vision and they're from macedonia and they appear to him and they said we want you to come over here and preach to us so paul had to turn and go back and he said i believe that if you are making a decision for god and do it the best that you can i believe god will correct you see to see that you don't go wrong you're talking about a loving father i believe god will do that now whenever we feel led say some of you are seeking god about your vocation well i think i'd like to be a an electrical engineer i'd like to be this i'd like to be that in reality god gives us in the way that he wants us to be i had all kinds of different plans of being this and that and the other and god laughed at my plans and said you ain't gonna be none of them i'm gonna make you a preacher and then whenever god says there's gonna be a preacher okay there's five aspects of being a preacher apostle prophet evangelist pastor teacher and god didn't even ask me which one i wanted to be you're saying now this ain't even right this ain't even right how can that be right he don't even ask me if i want to preach he don't say hey i'm saying about calling you to preach well you think about it you don't pray about it get back with me a few days and let me know what you think you know he don't even ask that and then whenever he wants me to be somebody don't say well i'll tell you what now there's five aspects which woman do you want to be well lord let me think about it i'll get back with you on that so what does god do now people look at a preacher and they think well he's the only one that god does that to no it's not you see god calls us and god gives us certain gifts and certain ability now let me say this to you tonight to encourage each of you no matter how much you made saying i have nothing i have no abilities you should never look at yourself in that way god has called you for specific things and if you all the time going around comparing yourself to this one and that one and the other one you'll never reach the mark of what god wants you to be brother daryl expressed that beautifully a couple weeks ago but yet god has called you so god calls us that way and then god wants us through prayer community of communication by by prayer to god and he will lead us what to do the right vocation so some start in college and they take a major in this and then after they're in there for a couple of months they're saying you know what i hate this i don't want to be this so then they go this way then they go that way and they go that way so you realize as the prophet said it that we would be better off we would save god and ourselves so much trouble in life if we would go to him and say father what do you want me to be what do you want me to become then study with a direction pray with a direction what's this in revelation chapter 4 the prophet comes back and he also gives us you all a sheep myself as well believe it or not just because i'm a pastor does not mean that i don't seek counsel because there's situations that i will come up against that maybe i've never dealt with before i'll look in the scriptures if i can find something that's happened before or i will look into the message and see if perhaps someone asks the prophet a question about this or that if i don't find it there and i pray and i can't seem to get into direction i will either call or contact brother tim pruitt brother ron spencer i've got brothers and friends of mine around the world and i will ask him look brothers have you all ever dealt with this have you ever dealt with that why because i'm still learning now here i am been pastoring for 40 years been preaching for longer than that but yet i don't think and i hope i never get to a spot to where i sing i do not need help and counsel and i've found many times that i've got my answer from the lord by talking to other men of god and god allows us to be able to do that now god doesn't give us pastors and friends and things like that so that they will be dictators over our heart or over our face they're there to help us whenever we're seeking god's counsel notice how brother ram goes with this and i said if you ever feel to do something or a revelation or something comes to you strangely something warningly or something be careful satan is as sly and slick as he can be put it with the word of god and consult your pastor now it's amazing how many people will never do that and then they go and make these mistakes in life and they look back and think well god i'd done everything you told me to do no you didn't well i prayed that's only part of what he said well i looked in the bible you're not going to find the word electrical engineer in the bible you're not going to find for some of you sister well i want to be a nurse i want to be an rn i want to be an lpn you're not going to find them in the bible either so there's many things about our life and our vocation that we simply won't find and remember even if you come and talk to me about it it don't mean i've got your answer because god may want to deal with you and you come and run it by me many times all i am as a pastor is simply a sounding board and i remember several years ago there's one of the brothers in our church and he was praying about taking a certain job and a certain thing so i told him i said i'll tell you what brother we're going to say here in the in the room here and i'm just going to listen to you and you talk now what i want you to do is i'm going to put a set of imaginary scales right here on my desk and i said i want you to put everything positive about this job on one side and i don't want you to put everything negative that you know about on the other side well he started well i'll make so much money oh that was a big positive okay so you know i'll i'll have to work and i'll be gone i'll be gone from home but i'll be able to stream services well that was another positive i'll be able to do this and i'll be able to do that so he talked and he taught man the more he taught that scale it was falling plumb off of my desk and every bit of it was positive so he said all that he wanted to say and i said can i say something he said sure that's why i'm here i want your advice so i said i noticed that you left out your wife and i noticed you left out your small children you got some children that's coming into their teens i noticed you didn't mention that is it okay if i put that on this side of the skeleton sure so i said so your wife is going to be here for weeks on end and she will have to be the head of the home right right so you got children and they so as i began to talk now i was not telling him what to do anybody ever talked to me no i i don't go that way what i want to do is to bring to you a balance and help you to look at it in the right way instead of just the one-sided way that most of us tend to look at things at because we are that way it's just humans as i sit there and talk to him and i watch this serious look change from a serious look to a smile and i realized right then he had his answer now i didn't tell him to do anything i didn't tell him you go there you don't do this you do this but all i did was by the spirit of god i helped balance up the scale that he had so improperly balanced and he made the decision totally himself completely now i've learned to realize that a lot of folks on reason that they will not consult the pastor before they make major decisions is because they don't know what he'll tell them and they really don't want to hear it now that's what gets us in serious trouble with god you see the lord loves us so much he will put one hurdle after another after another whenever we're fixing to make a terrible mistake one of the greatest and biggest mistakes you'll ever make in your life is to marry the wrong person and some of you you're single maybe you're looking for a man a woman of your dreams and you say i'm just so lonely i'm just so lonely i want a wife i want a husband i'm just so lonely i'll tell you what's even worse than being single and being lonely being married and being lonely because someone with a beautiful smile or beautiful eyes or whatever more and you overrode that something that that little red flag that little something in your heart that was just no no no no and the more you overrode it you begin to silence that voice i do not believe our father wants any of us to make the wrong choices in life i use this this illustration a lot as i said here in the office and i'm counseling to people and as they look out the blind they're on the outside and i'll tell them you've been up those steps there yes sir i've been up those steps i said so you know there's a really steep bank right there yes sir i know that bank i said okay so we're sitting in the office and we're talking about this and both of us see a small toddler and that toddler's standing right here about where i parked my car and we can see that toddler's hand is going in the direction of that bank we can see the way that toddler is going it has no intentions of stopping what we're talking about is very important that toddler is not yours it's not mine but we would stop our conversation and put it on hold and run out that door and grab that child because we can see that child does not understand by its ability of the depth of perception it does not see what's fixing to happen it could break its neck it could kill itself how cruel we would be if we would sit here and watch that child do that and then i'll turn and always say magnify that by millions and millions of times and imagine your loving heavenly father watching you in a precipice of life seeing you're fixing to make the most horrible decision of your life and him sitting there in heaven and say be careful rob be careful y'all have a safe trip now that's not my father and that's not your father so why is it that so many christians wind up making such a mess out of their life by what the decisions they make and many of them will title them i felt led well you can take my word for this you'd not believe the different things that i've heard that people felt led to do some have felt led to leave their wife and marry somebody else's wife well it wouldn't take much of a bible scholar to tell you that's the devil doing that right some of those things are no-brainers we can look at them and say well my goodness anybody in the right mind would know that but there's other parts about the journey that become a little more complicated so god gives us one barrier after another after another because he loves us so we won't make terrible mistakes clear anybody else anything question on that question okay how do you know when someone is the right one god has for you well it's butterflies don't you i thought everybody it may seem strange to people outside of our ranks but we know that our companion that was given to us by god it's actually not just our choice now it is our choice but when you look at it in reality the church that you go to is not really your choice the pastor that you set under it should not be your choice i mean i i hear it all the time that there's people actually come to happy valley and i wasn't their choice of a bastard that always makes me feel so wonderful i mean they're just being honest they would rather went here and there and there and then they're trying to make a point whenever they will tell me that i'm so glad that they always tell me the point afterwards because i probably just walk away very discouraged but but the point was that brother donald my first choice would have been to go here or there or there but i just kept feeding the lord was leading me here and now i see why because under your ministry we've changed and we've done this and that and the other so it it might be the same way with a mate so the very one that god might have for you initially you might look at them and they might look at you and they might not like you at all and they think what in the world is a matter of that girl what in the world is the matter with that boy sort of like carol did me when we initially met i knew she'd come around bless her heart she was just a little bit slower than me but she finally called up but god when god gives us that something it is truly a revelation now i'm sure that all of you young people sitting here tonight have had revelations from god in your life have you not whether it was serpentine god sending a prophet whatever doctrinal thing and you may have heard it since she was a little boy or a girl but one day reading and reading your bible listening to a tape sitting in a service maybe at a youth camp or a banquet all of a sudden that doctrine that you had heard all of your life and yet a preacher just went a little different angle than the way you'd ever heard it before and it's just like a light bulb switched on and you say oh my goodness i see it oh i see it another thing you see what serpents say serpent seed you've heard that since she was in sunday school but all of a sudden it becomes so real to you what was that a revelation from god and a real mate that god puts together that's what they really are but brother donnie what about the brown eyes and the blue eyes and the broad shoulders and the tall dark and handsome he might be short fat and squatty sister sarah are you saying amen i noticed it was just one-sided there but there's something about it when god puts you together that time can never separate sickness heartache can never separate i love the way that brother random deals with this and kinsmen redeemer when a man loves a woman and marries her because she's just pretty there'll be an end to that but when a man finds a woman that he loves he don't know why now how odd is that now that would be the very opposite of the way most people would describe what we call falling in love y'all familiar with the term right i mean truth goodness that ain't outdated falling in love so some people say it's love at first sight and truly for some it might be that way but for most people it's probably the term that i just used falling in love so you're around that person and you get to liken them more and more and you become more compatible and you all these things are going together so what's happening you're falling in love with that individual but if you can write down all the answers of why you love that person i would advise you not to marry them brother donny you didn't catch the quote he said when a man finds a woman that he loves he don't know why oh she's pretty she's you know her hair is certain certain color her eyes you know he's this tall dark handsome or short whichever and and whenever they you know well and then that well every one of those things you listed might change so as the electrician was up on the roof of a certain baptist church and he's repairing an electrical wire and he gets into that wire and his body grounds the wire and his face a married man with children nearly all of his face caught on fire and burnt off so if his wife married him because he was handsome and she goes to the hospital his flesh is melted he has no eyes no nose true story no lips they do surgery after surgery after surgery as a matter of fact this man is the first one in the united states to get a full face transplant so if she married him because of looks she would have a right to divorce him and marry another but what if she married him because she loved him and she couldn't really define oh yeah his looks was certain certain so and so his eyes his hair this and that and the other you can ask a lot of the men in our church that hair might go in time uh-oh and if it don't turn loose it will turn gray so it's going to turn one way or the other so when a person notice how he says this a man finds a woman he loves her and he don't know why he loves her and she finds the man that she loves boy sisters this is a tough quote to swallow no matter what he looks like brother robbie should have said hey man right there buddy he loves her she loves him listen what this is that's an eternal mate in glory death nor nothing else can ever separate them because they are from eternity and stepped out into a space of time and will return back to eternity eternity has dropped down in a body call time and it goes right back up into eternity again it cannot perish so how do you know when someone is right the right one that god has for you you pray you look at it now there's nothing wrong with looking at the differences that you have and you've heard me say it before that whenever i'm counseling a couple that's going to be engaged to get married and most of them will come to me before they get engaged and we're praying about it and i will ask them do you love each other yes yes have you prayed about it yes if you talk to her father yes we've got his blessing and then i'll say do you like each other yeah that's what they always do they always life why do y'all like when i say that now the reason i ask that is because after counseling 40 plus years of married people what i find is many times things that get on one another is things they don't like about one another it's not that they don't love anyone each other anymore but it's just the habitual day-to-day activity say some of you guys don't pick up your clothes very well now i'm not saying i'm just saying you know i'm just i'm not saying that there's anybody guilty here and you you've got you oh all right we've got a brother here under conviction lay your hand on him mercies so he doesn't pick up his shoes very well and each of us have our makeup the girl was raised in her norm the boy was raised in his norm and when you come together what are you going to do you're going to have trade-offs and you're going to find a new norm and create a new one but the difficult part is being able to merge together but if you've got real love by which you can base it on your love will be stronger than your dislikes for this that another now my wife carol she is a neat neat person i mean she loves neat super neat the more neat the better it is well i'm the type of guy if i'm working on something i've got this drawer open that drawer open this door open it don't make no sense to me to get screw out and put it back together get an open door get another screw out do that that don't make no sense so i've got cabinets down in my basement and i like to build woodworking and taxidermy work and different things that i do down there so i've got cabinets to stand about this tall double doors you open them up well i've got wood here i've got you know feathers over here i've got snake skins here i've got this this this so if i'm doing a taxidermy something for some some of the brothers i may have eight or ten of these cabinets open at one time that is until carol comes downstairs now carol's only going to be there 10 or 15 minutes but as carol comes by each double door them double doors don't close automatically but carol automatically closes them for me so she'll come through and close every one of them and when she leaves now i have to exert more energy to open every one of them back up i see you're laughing but you'd be surprised how many people that i have counseled that have had things just this simple and caused as the office problem ever was oh i dealt with an issue several years ago a man and wife it was nearly it was nearly a divorce case they called me it was screaming it was hollering it was awful and it was simply because she wanted breakfast for supper but he wanted supper for supper you think that's funny did you i'll call you the next time they call me did they love each other of course of course would they wish harm on either one no but it was just the likes and the dislikes real love can look at the flaws of that man that you want to marry and they don't have to say no they don't exist no i closed my eyes to any of her faults you better look at them buddy that's going to be what's going to aggravate you but if you love her more than her faults and you love him more than his faults and his shortcomings ah sounds like to me you all stepped out of eternity together to live here in a body called time so don't be afraid to look at shortcomings and don't be afraid to be able to acknowledge well this is fine knowing that that's okay i have no problem with that because our love will help us to deal with it that's the way real love is that's the way he loves us he looked at us and knew we would cause him so much pain even after we got saved but he loved us so much he said i'm willing i'm willing to embrace you with all your shortcomings aren't you glad boy i'll tell you one thing if jesus didn't love me like that there'll be no hope for me how do you know when someone is right the right one god has for you again approach it prayerfully open-hearted open mind be able to look and see are you compatible and don't just look at him but whenever i'm counseling sisters i will tell them that young man that you're looking at see how he treats his mama see how he treats his sisters if he has them that'll give you a pretty good idea of how he's going to treat you because if he has inferiority complexes toward women if he's raised by a strong woman in the house he may take that out on you once you're married i might not go into this office here and finish this and it's the same way young men whenever you are looking to marry a girl look and see how she treats her daddy look and see how she treats her brothers her uncles look and see how she treats the pastor or other men of authority in her life because don't think she's going to despise the pastor and her father and every other male figure in her life and all of a sudden oh she's just going to melt in your arms and everything is going to be wonderful you're dreaming boy i should say you've got a nightmare why because there's something in her that has molded her that way real love can look at that and see some of y'all think i'll never be buried i'd rather for you to delay it and find the right one i don't want to talk to you all in there right so when it's real love it can look at the flaws the shortcomings the mistakes and there's something in you that drives you toward that individual because it'll be god that pulls you together clear well we've got about 39 pages and we're at page six so far so we're not doing very good how do you know this was an awesome question how do you know when you have the holy ghost saint john 14 16 jesus said i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever now remember jesus not in the trinitarian view is praying to an old man in heaven and then the third person is going to come down but jesus is setting forth the office work of god not three people but offices i am husband i am father i am grandfather i am brother i am uncle i am all them offices but i'm only one person so jesus is praying to who the father that dwells in him and he said even the spirit of truth now jesus uses this several times in the gospels to describe the holy ghost this is what the holy ghost is the spirit of truth so we can have truths and not have the spirit of truth why because we can set under the right kind of teaching and many people have done it for years and years and they have truths but they have it up here and then they get around other people that talk them out of it and then they walk away from that truce that they had but if you get the spirit of truth with truth and it's sealed in your soul nobody can ever talk you out of it so notice jesus doesn't just say that i'll i'll give you the truth but even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive now this is why sinner if there would be one here tonight and they'd come up and say i want to get saved well we could not come and say all right let's everybody gather around this center and we're going to pray god will fill them with the holy ghost that's not going to happen they must repent could they get the holy ghost in a few minutes oh yes they could but god ain't going to give them the holy ghost until they repent of their sins and god eradicates that nature but notice jesus identifies it as the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it sees him not neither know us him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you so jesus is describing himself this is another reason people can't get the holy ghost they're praying for a third person but jesus said the reason you guys are going to get it is because you know him he dwells with you he dwells with you now but he's going to be in you notice in chain john 14 18 he says i will not leave you comfortless ah well wait a minute i thought he said the holy ghost is going to come he is the holy ghost in another form i will come to you now notice the attributes of the holy ghost saint john 14 26 but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i've said unto you saint john 15 26 but when the comforter is come whom i will send unto you from the father well now wait a minute i thought jesus said the father was going to send it in his name now jesus said he's sending it from the father if these ain't the same people we've got about two or three different holy ghosts and we've got two or three people sinning it i remember when i was over in china several years ago all them folks that were still struggling with the godhead so the lord placed it on my heart to be able to approach it from the old testament and the new testament and the lord began to quicken some things to me where god said in the old testament he was the first and the last then i come to the new testament jesus said he was the first and he was the last god said this and this and this in the old testament jesus said the very same words in the new testament and then as the spirit of god began to bring that together and i brought it to those chinese believers and they begin to see themselves from their own bible that either this person was the very same one or there's two firsts and two lasts two beginnings or two gods and you know what they're sent them chinese christians and more here tonight than there were there in that particular meeting but they sat there and the spirit of god and i watched it over this person and that one and that one and that one and their eyes come open brother rob it was absolutely phenomenal to watch the spirit of god is he quickened and opened their eyes to that understanding so this is one reason why people cannot receive the holy ghost because they're praying to a person that does not exist holy spirit come holy spirit holy spirit please holy spirit third person of the godhead come into me they're praying to a false god that's heavy so when you pray for the holy ghost you're not praying to a second person or a third person but you're praying to the almighty the one and true and living god for him to come into you in the form of the holy ghost what is the holy ghost it's the god form that can come into us human beings you see we could not receive that form that's in the heaven that is called theos that is the infinite the ineffable that's the everything the eternal there's no way i could contain that so god condescended in a form called the baptism of the holy ghost and he said here donnie i'll come down in such a form that you can receive me it's still me and the same contents that's in this gatorade right here is in one drop or a whole bottle or a whole building full in eternity is the whole building full as we'd say but my baptism is one drop now notice in saint john 16 13 how be it when he the spirit of truth has come here's the evidence he will guide you into all truth so the holy ghost will guide you into all truths which will include luke 17 30. malachi 4 revelation 10. so he doesn't just lead you to preaching on the cross now you see people misunderstand us when we say that are you against the cross no but there's so much more than just the cross watch people who stop at the cross see how far they go in god as if though god made all these mistakes by inspiring his men to write all these other things in the bible i want you to think of this john the beloved was the only apostle that stood at the foot of the cross when you get time i'd like for you to do a bible search for me you can do it online if you don't have software on your phone and see how many times john mentions the word cross and yet this man saw it himself but he mentions it less than some of the other writers you think well my goodness he's the guy who saw it he did see it but yet how come he didn't preach it more than paul how come he didn't preach it more than peter more than jude the same man who saw the cross was the same one who preached about seven seals seven thunders seven church ages one mystery after another after another after another why why why would he do that because he saw the cross was the bridge that placed us on the other side back into the presence of god and made a way for all the rest of these other other things to be understood by the grace of god oh how could we ever get to god without the cross there's no way this is god's way but it is just the beginning to get us to his presence let me read a couple more scriptures ken it's time for us to stop ephesians chapter 2 verse 1 and you has he quickened now remember this question what it was how can you how do you know when you have the holy ghost look at these scriptures he'll lead and guide you into all truth he'll guide you into the ways of the word of god he will be a comforter the word comfort there's a greek word paraquatos which is one that's called alongside to help you see the spirit of god doesn't just want to be the pastor god don't want me to be your holy ghost god don't want your mom and daddy to be your holy ghost he wants you to have the baptism of the holy ghost just like your mama just like your daddy just like every other individual on the earth that's had it and he wants to be able to guide you through the things of life but notice paul says you hath he quickened who were dead and trespasses and sins now this is before we got converted where in time passed you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the heir the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience this is before we got the holy ghost among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind this is pre-holy ghost so people that lust that lie that commit adultery that do many of these things and they profess christianity i'm not going to say they're not a christian i'm not going to say that they're not looking to the lord for their salvation but i will say they don't have the holy ghost because the holy ghost delivers us from such a life if he don't what good does it do to have the holy ghost among whom now notice how paul puts it in the past for those that are converted among whom also we all had our conversation in times past not ongoing since we've got the holy ghost but this was before we got converted in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature children of wrath even as others so what does the holy ghost do changes your desires changes your nature how will you know if you got the holy ghost well you'll love the things of god you'll love his word now that don't mean you're not going to fight this battle because this don't have the holy ghost you all understand that right and it will be carnal sticky it'll bother you as long as you live that's right first john 3 14 we know we know that we have passed from death unto life because read it with me we know we have passed from death unto life so it's not guessing i'm hoping well i hope i am well we can know beyond the shadow of a doubt that we have passed from deaths unto life because we love the brethren he that love us not his brother abide us in death and whosoever hate us his brother is what a murderer a murderer and you know no murderer has eternal life abiding in him so anyone oh you said well i don't like the way they do but do you hate them there's a great difference in not liking the way a brother does this or a sister does that and not liking their mannerisms and we've all got that oh this is one reason why we all need a body change thank god we're going to be set free from ourselves can i go can i have just a couple more minutes and we'll stop right here this is a private interview it was uh from a sister by the name of sister georgie bruce she went to the branham tabernacle and went there for many many years she recorded this private interview and several years ago they made it public sister bruce says but i've never had an experience that i have been filled with the holy ghost now listen to this carefully that i could put my foot on all right notice this now this is brother branham ordinarily a human being born in sin shape and liquid come the world speaking lies that's the nature of a human being sister bruce says yes that was our nature it changed once but what changed it she answers christ there you are sister see that's it he that hearst my words and believeth on him that sent me now remember this is july the 5th 1964 has eternal life and shall not come into judgment but at past tense past from death unto life saint john 5 24 jesus speaking and you're a christian sister bruce i've watched your life now listen to this i've watched you under vision and i know you're a christian all i can say is it's a good thing i wouldn't in that interview if that name would have been instead of sister bruce had been brother donnie reagan and that prophet looked at me and said donny i've watched your life by vision i'd said where you want a new outdoor in this office i'd have had myself a spell but i believe with all of my heart we can be just as sure as sister georgia bruce was now that wasn't enough he goes on to say see i'm your shepherd as it was and sister bruce says yes somebody to help which is what a shepherd is of course see if there was any doubt in my mind if i thought there was something wrong i'd tell you sister bruce she says i believe that but if there's anything wrong in your experience anything between you and god as far as i know anything about his sister bruce there's not a thing i don't think we could have anything ever better said to us in our life how awesome that would be in this place if every one of us could have that assurance there's nothing between you and god tonight praise the lord sister bruce there's not one thing now we'll stop we'll pick that up again because i've got several more things here that i'm going to go into i don't i don't want to rush it let's just buy our heads lord jesus i sent your presence thank you that it worked out this way lord i prayed how to even put these questions in order i see why you had me to put them the way that i did you knew it would work out this appropriate time or jesus may you search each of our hearts tonight we want your will yes we want the right mate in life if you've called us to be a carpenter a painter or a real estate agent or whatever it is father we want that but oh lord to know that there's nothing between us and our savior what would it be worse to each of us tonight in this building and those that are streaming to know there's nothing between us and you i don't believe you love sister georgia bruce more than you love us just a simple little woman a woman that was not a great theologian a woman that probably the world would have looked at and turned up their nose at her but what an answer she got from the presence of god lord jesus i believe you desire by your presence tonight to make that just as real to us that each of us can know it is well with my soul there's nothing between me and my savior would you deal with each of our hearts father with our heads bowed i wonder not only just in the visible audience but those that have streamed and those that'll go back and archive this later i wonder how many of us here just by raising our hands say lord that's what i want more than anything but i can know there's nothing between me and you not temper not any besetting sin lord not lust not lying nothing nothing jealousy hatred nothing lord between me and you now i don't believe it's just something that the lord wants to happen here this monday night and then we lose it no i believe he wants us to live there so every day of our life but brother donald what if i mess up he's made a way for us john said little children i write unto you that you sin not but if any man's sin we have a perpetuation a go-between we have an atonement or a sacrifice which is jesus christ the righteous he's the one who made a way god don't want us to miss the mark and that's what the word sin means to miss the mark so what do we do when we miss it we ask him to forgive us and help us to overcome that so we don't fall into that trap again how many of you want that in your life tonight would you just raise your hand to the lord god bless you would you mind just putting your hand on that person's shoulder maybe sitting there near you let's just offer a word of prayer for each other lord jesus we bring our our brothers and sisters our friends maybe it's a sister in the flesh even a brother in the flesh lord god we bring each other we're not praying for ourselves now but we're asking you tonight father lord is the pastor of this assembly i don't know of anything greater i could ask for lord but that each of these sheep could have this in their life not only them but their mothers and fathers and their grandmothers and grandfathers and every individual lord those around the world that call this their home church father they have no church to attend where they live lord that each of them father god they can have this testimony heavenly father that they they feel there's nothing between you and them oh what a victory we would have in our lives lord jesus and we know that involves so much that involves our everyday walk and making the right choices and praying over things and going about things the way you've laid it out for us help us father if there's one here tonight they've missed the will of god somehow help them lord to realize they just go back they just they just simply go back and say lord i missed you i'm sorry about that i want to start over again lord help us to realize that's what it takes real believers the zeal of this hour is repent and that's what we always want to be able to do it's one great difference that we notice between saul and david david had his mistakes and his errors but saul could never admit he was completely wrong himself he wanted to blame it on this one and that one and the other well the people wanted me to do it the people wanted this and the people wanted that but yet david was a man after god's own heart he was not perfect he was not without his flaws but there's one thing david knew how to do he knew how to repent and he knew how to repent fast when the prophet stood there and said david thou art to man within a few seconds the judgment of god would have thundered from that prophet's mouse but david repented immediately in his heart and the next words to come out of that prophet's lips was not i condemn you to death it was not you will die but the next words that come out of his lips was you shall not surely die why because david knew how to repent and repent quickly lord may we always know how to do that when we make our mistakes when we make the wrong choices whatever it is in life may we be able to quickly repent go back and start over again father thank you for our time together tonight lord i pray that it was pleasing to your father we love you in the name of the lord jesus praise the lord can we stand our feet maybe they'll come and just sing sing a little song together as we worship the lord for just a few minutes before we go thank you for coming tonight at this rate it may take us a little while to get to all of them but we'll do our best so god bless you don't you just love him with all your heart some of you will never make the who's who you'll never be a great renowned scientist maybe or a doctor that'll find some cure for some terrible disease well i can tell you i've been in who's who there ain't no big deal about it no i was in there a few years ago my name is there i've got the copy if you'd like to look at it didn't do me any good at all somebody recommended that i go in there and they sent me a copy they sent me a notification again last week hey we're wanting to put you back and who's who i thought didn't do me no good then what did probably do for me now but i know one who's who that i'm in and i believe every one of you here tonight are in that one who's god's who that's the one we want it don't we our lives may be so small in the eyes of the world but remember he loved you so much i believed he would have died for you if you were the only one that was on the earth he would have done it for you though jesse just sing something for us can we just worship together just a little bit before we go

again for brother donnie that was outstanding i want to thank you so much for studying and and making things so clear and i just want to tell you when i first before i started coming to church i'll just give you a little testimony one of the things that got my attention was brother larry elliott had had worked with me and we went to lunch every day and there would be a bible question that would come up and we're in the bible belt and everyone has an opinion and we would have this person from this denomination give their opinion on a question and it would go around the table and when that when the message came forth it's like i recognize that voice there's something behind it and it's like that's the answer and there are so many things and i started i got my attention i started reading the message and i started seeing there are answers to life's questions my concern for you being younger i've i can associate with a lot of these things because i am older and i've had more time for mistakes and learning from mistakes the joy of the message is that you can learn what god has for you before you make that mistake it may cause you all kinds of pain and it's something it was i marveled at the fact that there was answers in the message there was answers to life and questions that men have wondered for as long as human history what those answers are and if things are there and it's something to have brother donnie it was like a counseling session that many times i will go to him and ask my pastor what on this something big event and that was like coming out tonight and i just appreciate you could enjoy that thank god for brother donnie doing that study i thank you i encourage you to again know it's a wonderful thing that we admire and appreciate once again thank you for being here want to do it again god bless you all have a good night you're dismissed thank you [Music] you
