we thank you Lord Jesus thank you for the great gift of Life yes Lord thank you often think when I take these little children my arms and look down into their face how you must have felt that day when you made your first son you didn't make him a baby but a full-grown man it must have thrilled you when you sell the first of your own kind how when a mother and father bring their little child son or daughter to give it to you and they look at each other through their Union and the product of that Union and that little baby maybe a mother's nose a Daddy's Eyes fingers toes they can see that reflected through that Union dear God then they know the greatest thing they can do is bring it back to you father we're just praying today that you would be with our brother and sister and helps them with the great awesome responsibility of not only giv a child life but bringing it up in a way that'll please you was truly it takes you to help us Lord he didn't come with a manual or how-to book but

to hear his mother The Fifth Gospel yes Lord be able to instill in the great things of God well truly if we can bring them up in the right way that's pleasing to you this is the shortest time we'll ever have them so beyond the curtain of time they will be with their offspring forever yes Lord dear God we bring him to you today who dedicate his little life to you I ask you father you keep him from the evils of the day if time would ter that he come to the age of accountability Lord Jesus deal with his heart while he's young and tender May the presence of God be with him we commit him to you today Father in the name of the Lord Jesus amen yeah dodo Grandpa Stand Together what a privilege it is for us to be gathered together again today in the house of the Lord let's turn to First Corinthians chapter 11 if you would today I'm as happy to be a Christian happy to be given the opportunity to be able to serve the Lord in this day and all the things that he's done in this hour that we live 1 Corinthians 11:34 if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come 1 Corinthians 1440 let all things be done decently and in order the word order is taxi and arranging Arrangement a fixed succession observing a fixed time do or write order orderly condition now this type of biblical order is not formalism it's just the way God wants things done so it's a post a rank or a position which one holds in Civic or other Affairs since this position generally depends on one's talents you'll find the prophet saying the same thing question answers 1961 he said I like to look and see what a person is professing God has called them to do because generally Works God works with his creature the way that he has made him so if a man claims he's called to preach watch how he interprets the word he says that'll let you know if God's already called him or not so this position generally depends on one's talents experiences resources character fashion quality and style Colossians chapter 2 verse 5 for though I be absent in the flesh yet am I with you in the spirit joying and beholding your order so Paul is not rebuking them for having the right kind of order for ISM now of course spirit of God rebukes that but this is the type of order that God wants so it actually made Paul so happy and he said even though he was not there but he was hearing through the reports back from the church at colossia what they were doing and they said um Bishops and all that sort of thing up in the church and they had deacons and people of position and Paul heard back and he said I'm not there but I'm with you in spirit and I'm joying and beholding your your order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ I mean let to be remembered today as we pray God bless you Heavenly Father we're so grateful that we could be gathered together once again here today Lord in this building that you've given us dear Jesus we've seen you do so many awesome things in our in our midst and for that we will forever be grateful but as needy human beings we come again today we have different needs different desires petitions you saw the hands that were uplifted maybe a marital problem maybe a financial issue maybe a son or daughter away from God I pray whatever that request is that you'd be mindful of them Lord father we're asking you today also for those that are sick and needy some in our assembly fighting tremendous battles with their health they need Miracles father and Lord we're mindful also and thankful that you brought our brother Larry Elliott through his surgery was able to come home and recuperating and we're just praying for our brother that you'd continue to strengthen and be with him help me now Lord as I Endeavor to speak on the words of Life take the service take the word help me Lord Jesus help the people for it's the glory of God and the kingdom which is to come that we ask these things in Jesus Christ Christ name amen God bless you you may be seated I want to speak to you again today by the help of the Lord on the right to be in divine order the right to be in divine order uh I'd like to go if we can back to when the prophet was out west and him and some of the brothers were on a hunting trip and he looked looked up into the Stars into the sky and he began to relate what he saw and I said somewhere in there I had it pointed out to me one time in an observatory the Zodiac beginning with the Virgin coming over through the cancer age on down to the last was the lion Leo the Lion the first coming of Christ by the Virgin the second coming by the lion of the tribe of Judah I've tried my best to see that zodiac and I can't see it yet notice now it's there those who are trained know it's there job saw it man used to look at it it was a Bible one day it was a Bible one day but in that whole great mass of millions and billions of light years God sits in the the midst of it all and he looks down Paul is in there my mother is in there somewhere looking down and I thought of the order of the Heavenly Host not one of them's out of place every one of them keeps its time perfectly God's Great Army so he looking at the stars and of course at that time man couldn't not see where he's able to see now because of the equipment that they had in 1962 and it's like it's exploded um in this last day of what man has been able to see beyond what he could see at that time and it no doubt it would be overwhelming for the scientists in 1962 to be able to come back today and look through an observatory and see what scientist see now when they didn't even have the terminology that men use today they never use the word Parasect they never use certain terms the scientists have to use today to Define what they have seen and I Marvel at that myself because I find it amazing that science has been able to grow so much and understand so much more and yet when it comes to religion and church some people are still talking the same thing they talked for decades and hundreds of years ago they've not grown any in God their understanding is not grown they're exactly where their grandfathers were where their great-grandfathers were but aren't you glad God has allowed a people on the Earth in the last day to also grow with the time now when brother brandham looked up it must have been a great thing now remember a prophet sees things quite different than any the rest of us sees it so for him to call the Stars a great Army I mean know brother brand was not in the sense of a Hebrew scholar or a Greek scholar he uses several words down through the the years of the message but and he would take a Greek Lexicon but he was not one to use a lot of the Greek words and the Hebrew words so whether he ever even looked it up to be able to see what God said about the word host in the Old Testament which means an army I don't really know but yet he identified what he saw as an army of God and he saw them in a divine order and he believed according to what he saw that every one of them had a certain pass and if they stayed in that pass it would work exactly right but then he was puzzled and you can watch him as he talks about the earth and the the moon and all how it comes through and we'll jump down to paragraph three and I thought about that being God's Great Army there and I went to bed and I began to think that not one of those get out of their place they all set in place and if there's a moving anywhere of them for a cause it will affect the Earth we just seen the results of it now from some of them moving into other spots it's effective it affects everything and I thought then if that Gra heavenly host that has to keep its place to make everything in order what about the disorder of the Earthly host how when one gets out of order it throws the whole s out of cater the whole program of God is upset when one member gets out of order we should continually strive to keep the order of the spirit now notice he says the order of the spirit so the spirit of God has an order and that order is not formality that order is not dead and dry but it is a way by which God moves now according to Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created the Heaven in that particular spot Moses does not use the plural form but God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness covered the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and he called The Darkness night now the Earth is in the heavens too is it not but isn't it amazing that God separated the Earth out of the heavens and gave it its own special place in the heavens so it sort of reminds me of the people of God that we are in the world but we are not of the world so the Earth was identified in the heavens but yet called out from the heavens and given a special place if you wish to say it this way the Earth was Sanctified to the Lord God for a special purpose out of all the rest of the planets and the stars and as I quoted to you a couple of weeks ago that in the observable universe that there is estimated to be one septian Stars several trillion galaxies in those galaxies can be millions of stars and yet none of them does the bible call their name not another planet does the bible Call It by name you see when God calls something or someone by name and sanctifies them to himself it is a special choice voice and a reason that God is doing it now watch God now wrote this in the stars and God before he ever used the word election predestination choosing God wrote it in Stardust so God wrote The Mystery of predestination in the Stars God wrote that there would be a bride one day that would be separate from from all the rest of the church he wrote it in the Stars God called the Earth by name and wrote that in the stars that there would be a planet above all the rest and as we looked at it last Sunday that one little blue dot in the mass of all the universe and yet one spot that God chose to be in what scientists call the habitable zone so if the Earth was so much so many thousand miles closer to the Sun it would be too hot for life to grow if it was very much farther out away from the Sun it would be too cold for life to be able to survive so God placed it exactly in what they term as the habitable zone well you see that's the way it is with people some people no matter how much you and I pray for them how much we want them to be bride we will never even by prayer and fasting be able to make anyone bride only God can do that and if God never ordained that their life be in the spiritual habitable zone They will never be able to bring forth bride seed they may be good people they may go to church and they may wind up being saved as we would say but will never wind up being elect man is so interested in being able to get out there it's reading one day this week where Elon Musk is wanting to make a habitable place on Mars already planning it out with all the different things that they're doing and they want to make this community in Mars and I saw you know that that's the the the Mind of Men we've got thousands and thousands of acres in Texas in Arizona in Utah in Nevada in all types of places that aren't even habited by a human being now and yet instead of trying to figure out how to be able to bring water and this and that and the other on our own Planet they're trying to reach out yonder somewhere and put a community on Mars ain't nobody belongs on Mars but martians if there was such a thing but you see it's like man always wants to look beyond what God gives him so instead of being satisfied that God gave the Earth according to the Book of Psalms God gave the Earth to man not Mars not Saturn I don't care what they do they'll never find another planet that is special like the earth I don't care what the church does I don't care how much they despise the messenger and the message they will never replace the end time message in the last day they're looking for it here and they're looking for it there they can look all they want to look God chose Malachi 4 and Malachi 4 is the way he will do it is that right now that's God's choice but yet there's something in man that he's got to go beyond where God put him and find for something you imagine how many billions of dollars are wasting how much that they are wasting and people living their life for an absolute fruitless cause of something that will never materialize because the Bible says God gave the Earth to man so why shouldn't man just be happy where God put him you know it's the same way when we look at the spiritual reflection in the word that we've got people always no matter in every message that God sent to the Earth that there was an element of people that could never be satisfied living in the boundaries of the revealed word of their hour they constantly had to look and search for something new something different something that was just a little bit beyond what the messenger of their age said I hope somebody's sharing this morning and we find the same thing going on around the ranks of our message preachers always looking for just a little bit more than what God's Prophet said well he didn't exactly say it that way but he should have well he didn't exactly put it this way but if he would be here now he would say it this way well you know sounds like a martian to me somebody that's trying to move out of the designated area that God gave us as his people I said it years ago and I believe it's the same way if the Bible don't say it and the message don't speak it Heaven don't require it well come on somebody I don't care how many dreams and Revelations and visions that people have if it ain't in the word of God for the hour I personally don't have time for it and the church said you see the Earth is a part of the Heavens but Sanctified now look what does God give a man a wife for and whenever the Jews would get married in the Old Testament s of the Orthodox of this day they will say something like this I sanctify thee be thou Sanctified unto me according to the law of Moses and of Israel be thou Sanctified unto me according to the law of Moses and of Israel so a woman then that would join up to a husband the husband takes that set aart woman and by setting herself apart from the rest of the world which means she'll have no more lovers no more boyfriends nothing like that she's Sanctified to this one man in this sanctification is what makes her joining or her Union to her husband and it comes from the man's mouth be thou th Sanctified unto me now this is what God has done in every age by the message of the hour that he's called to the elect and said to the elect be thou Sanctified unto me set apart from me don't dress like them don't act like them don't do the way they do but be thou Sanctified unto me and the elect of every age have done exactly that now the Earth could not make herself habitable how could the Earth be able when God the logos spun it off in the beginning and he Let It Drop for so many millions of miles and God designated the decreed path for the Earth how could the Earth do that herself how could the Earth pick out that I want to be in the certain spot in the solar system and I want to be there I want to be there the Earth couldn't do that it was decreed by the almighty God no more than you and I can make ourself any more than the Divine allocation of God God has given to us and would make our lives so much easier if we would just find what God's called us to be get in that spot work in that spot and stay in that spot for the rest of our life but there's always something about man and his curious nature that he wants to move Beyond because with a lot of people it's like they feel like they've got so many more talents and so many more gifts oh if they could just move Beyond this or that or the other and you know it as well as I do a lot of times that's nothing but the devil now as God then wrote The Mystery of the Bible up in the Stars before he put it on parchment then we can see in there that there's certain ones that are chosen to be in certain things I like the constellations remember when you look up and one night last week was supposed to been one of the clearest nights and it was absolutely a beautiful night and Carol and I was out after dark and we was able to look up into the Stars absolutely incredible and I told her I said think of it these are the same stars that Adam saw exact same constellation that Moses saw when he was here the very same ones that Joshua saw the very same ones that the Lord Jesus when he looked up and he looked up at his handiwork when he was here and not one of them has moved a million miles you know when you look into the belt of Orion or you look into the stars and you see that there's a Nova Supernova that's down inside of there and the light the from there thousands of years ago that's coming to the Earth and it was the exact same one that was there when Caligula was the emperor of Rome when Nero was there as the emperor of Rome they looked up and saw that same thing and it was written there in the stars and God wrote that mystery himself so we can learn by it can we not so God chose them and yet it's not like one night you look at and there was a star that was was in the belt of a ran or the sword that hangs down on the side and then the next night you look at it it decided it don't want to be there no more it's of been in the belt so it moves over in tarus which is the sign of the bull and then the next night you look over and it winds up being in Leo the Lion no it's only people that do that come on church it's people that get tired of doing this and then they'll move around in the spiritual constellation of God that's why we need to pray about where we go to church church is not like picking out a grocery store and remember once you find that spot where God wants you the devil will do everything he can to move you from that God ordained place because if he can move the man in the home out of the will of God it can throw the entire home out of the divine order of God and you men will be responsible for that just keep that in mind and it's the same way with a pastor of a church or a preacher if God can be able to call a man and gift a man giving them element of influence and then cause that man to get out of the divine order of God and then maybe affect hundreds of people and that man will be responsible for it is that right so you look that unlike the Stars which are ordained then they've got a certain past and no doubt there's an element of variance that's made in their past because we know even the moon itself being an average of What 293 M th000 miles something like that from the Earth to Sun being an average of 93 million miles and you know how it is that the sun can be brighter in the fall and the winter it'll about blind you if you're driving toward the East and the morning or toward the west in the evening is that right and it's actually closer to the Earth in the winter time by proximity be but because it tilts on its axis the Rays and stuff is further away and yet when you look at it God knew that the Earth in the beginning made it to stand up like this after the fall the Earth felt with it so the Earth felt to a tilt but God made it knowing that it would happen so there's an element of our life that the variables of degrees by which we have the perfect will of God and then we have the permissive will of God and all how each of us should seek and desire and hunger for that perfect will of God in our lives and the church said I personally don't desire do not want absolutely not the permissive will of God in my life I want the perfect will of God now watch let's look at Israel whenever God brings the Stars down on the earth and they begin to mirror the same thing because remember God told Abraham to look at the stars and then he told him to to look at the sand and then God tied the dust to the stars and the stars to the dust so he said so shall thy seed be on the earth so God and most even most people that don't believe in predestination we believe that Israel was the chosen people of God we believe that do or not so a lot of people that do not believe in predestination in the New Testament we believe that God chose Israel in the Old Testament I remember when the Bible was coming in the Old Testament God was mirroring what he was going to do after his deaths on the cross what's this in Exodus 19:3 and Moses went up to God and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say unto the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel you have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bear you on Eagle wings and brought you unto myself now what's what God is doing God is reminding Israel of their Exodus and what was their Exodus out of Egypt on an eagle's wings I many knows what that eagle's name was Moses now God used a prophet to call Israel out of Egypt and yet we know that were the Flesh of the Egyptian just the same as Israel's flesh yes as far as flesh it was but they were given a Divine promise of God they never chose God God chose them is that true and what did God do to cause this great Exodus he sent a prophet with a message now notice you have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bear You On Eagle's Wings and brought you unto myself now God is going to separate Israel not only out of the land of Egypt but event you bring them to the land that was promised to their fathers and once they get there he is going to call them out from among all the rest of the nations of the earth he wants them to dress different you know God designated that so that whenever a Jew no matter if he was in Cyprus if he was in among the sirenians wherever the man was that they would be able to look at that man and know that man or that woman was a Jew because of the the way they dressed they would sit down and eat with them they would know that was a Jew why because of the dietary laws so they would see them pray they would see them as they would plant their Gardens and they would know that family was a Jewish family because a Jewish family was not allowed to seow diverse kinds of seed in their rows that have to have a single row of corn single row of peas single row of maters single row of ters and whatever more they knew that was a Jew because they could look at their garments and see there was not a mixture of wool and flax or Linen in the same garment now why would God do this because God is a god of Separation so by their language and they would have what was called a riband r i BB a n d a riband of blue on the bottom of their garment they would know they were Jewish so there was so many things about them that they could look and see why would God do that so people would ridicule them and make fun of them God wanted them separated to himself but can't you see how lead deia wants to be they want to claim the power of the Cross they want to claim Heaven they want to claim that they're going in the Rapture and the body change but they want to look like the world talk like the world act like the world come on somebody they don't want to be separated they don't want to be different they don't want to stand out from the world God's people have always stood out from the world I'm glad he's got some that still do today how I bear You On Eagle's Wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if ye will obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant then ye shall be a pecul wow pecul treasure A peculiar treasure look at the word peculiar it means possession valued property peculiar treasure so peculiar treasure is a costly possession acquired with exertion and carefully guarded carefully reserved as the richest treasure among men even as The Treasure of princes consisting of gold and silver precious stones pearls and jewels now notice they did not choose God to be the pecul hey God we we want to be your peculiar people we desire to be your peculiar treasure notice where this is placed he chose them well let me just remind you today Word of Life you never Co chose God God chose you so in reality what I made up my mind I'm quitting uh your choice don't really matter Hallelujah God ain't leaving it up to me God ain't leaving it up to you he chose as himself now watch God said if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the Earth is mine now once again the mirror is taking place to where the stars the path of the stars is being reflected on the people on the Earth that are hearing the creator of the heavens identify them with Earth notice again in Exodus 19:6 and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation these are the words which Thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel so now God is using the mouth of a prophet to relate God's special design and choice for the children of Israel and it comes through the prophet's message to help the people to see this now he never exactly told Abraham this he never exactly told Isaac or Jacob these words because the Revelation is now growing to what God wants them to be so who does he use the word comes only to a prophet not to a pastor not to a teacher not to an evangelist so God speaks these words this is the message of that day so God is letting them know that they will be a kingdom of priests now remember not a priesthood but a kingdom of priests and a holy nation these are the words which Thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel Deuteronomy 7:6 for thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God look at the word holy sacred Saint set apart a holy people saint that's amazing because the Hebrew and the Greek and the way this ties together this word is very very similar when it comes to the New Testament so it's really special to be called a saint of God a Sanctified one cesh which means one that is called apart from everybody else now keep in mind it's already written up there that little tiny blue dot the only one that has horses and cows and pigs and all this sort of thing by whom by God so God put it in the past so it could receive of his great benefits now here God is saying about a people I'm going to call you out to myself for thou art Unholy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself special possession peculiar treasure literally to be to him for a people of property a people his own his peculiar property you can see why typical Le toan will never be able to be this they're going to do what they want to do when they want to do it and there ain't nobody going to tell them no different now they want to go to church many of them do they're religious and they want to go to church but they don't want you telling them what kind of clothes to wear how they've got to do this and do that and the other all they want is a preacher that preaches greasy Grace and they can get by with anything and everything they want to do they don't want no dos and no don'ts come on somebody they don't want no you can't do this and you can't do that and you can't go here and you can't say this all they want is freedom to do whatever they want to do and then when they die they all go flying away to Heaven they live like the devil they acted like the devil they cuss they drink they lie they cheat they steal and when they die they all wind up going to heaven that is a lie you only walk down the streets of gold if you are living a life worthy of the Gospel praise the Lord now now God says now you imagine these adjectives that God is using thou art a holy people now this did not mean they were a sinless people or without mistake but they were called apart set aside set aside for God the Lord thy God ha chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people as the Earth is chosen above all the other planets it doesn't really matter if Mars is jealous or not it doesn't matter if Saturn gets M say well my goodness my name ain't even in the Bible Uranus can say my name is not even in the Bible Pluto say I'm jealous my name is nowh written in the Bible the Earth's name is the only planet written in the word of Goden well praise the Lord neither can Earth say oh look at who I am and look at what I am I am so special I am so loved and you are because God was the one who loved you neither can we go around with a stuck out chest and her head kick back oh my looking down on other people if you are part of the Bride you ought to be so grateful you ought to be so happy that God himself chose you above all people that are on the face of the Earth how many believes this to be God's word how many believes he's the same yesterday today and forever so it could choose people in the Old Testament and make them above all the rest of the people and then comes in the New Testament somehow Brother D and God got saved well when Jesus died God got saved and God got he really got you know worked over and really got changed and everything and now God don't practice that that evil thing of predestination predestination ain't evil in the first place notice in Deuteronomy 7:7 the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in in number than any people for ye were the fewest of all people so where's them great big things they did where's them great big things we do but because Hallelujah the Lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers hath the Lord brought you you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house AB bondman somebody ought to be praising the Lord with me that's the very reason the Lord God called us out in this last day not because we're great people not because we're wonderful people not because our human character surpasses everybody else if it was not for the grace of God many of you'd be out drunk this morning or trying to get some cure from a headache that you had because you drunk last night you'd be looking for another shot in your arm you'd be running around with somebody else's wife or somebody else's husband come on children let's have church today I'll tell you why you said here today if you love Jesus Christ with all of your heart it's because the Lord God chose you not because you're special not because you are good but because he is mighty He is wonderful and he gives Grace To whom he will give [Applause] it woo know therefore that the Lord thy God he is God the faithful God which keepeth Covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his Commandments to a thousand Generations Deuteronomy 142 for thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God and the Lord hath chosen thee To Be A peculiar people unto himself above all the nations that are upon the Earth I'd like to say to Hamas the PLO the Brotherhood from Egypt I'd like to say to Hezbollah the Lord God chose Israel you can partner up with a r you can partner up with Russia Israel partnered up with God Hallelujah let the enemies of this message promote their lives let them write news articles let them get on YouTube and say what they will but the Lord God chose William bradam to be the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 and there ain't enough devils in hell to shake the bride of Christ away from the message of the last days Hallelujah there ain't enough videos on YouTube there ain't enough articles in the newspaper you will never move the [Applause] bride Hallelujah I absolutely love this scripture in Deuteronomy 4:20 but the Lord has taken you and brought you forth out of the iron furnace out of the iron furnace even out of Egypt to be unto him a people of inheritance friends that's us we are a people of inheritance a people of inheritance now that don't just mean that you get one an inheritance it means you are one I know it's almost more than our minds can comprehend but the Lord God's inheritance is his people it's not the Stars it's not the galaxies or the universe but the Lord's portion is his people a people of inheritance Deuteronomy 9:29 yet they are thy people Moses speaking back to God now yet they are thy people and thine inheritance which thou broughtest out by Mighty power and by thy stretched out arm notice God delivered them by a stretched out arm and in the New Testament God delivered his new testament bride by stretched out arms Hallelujah Eli elast my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me and Hell Rejoice no doubt prematurely because they thought that Miracle Worker that sign worker that man that could walk on water now he's died like any other man and the devil probably thought boys we have defeated did him until a knock come down on Hell's door and when the knock come down on Hell's door and the door was answered and they realized there was the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end oh Hallelujah who was it the same Lord God that brought Israel out of Egypt had now come down to deliver his people with outstretched arms Deuteronomy 328 when the most high this is absolutely amazing to me when the most high divided the Nations their inheritance when he separated the sons of Adam he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel it wasn't first come first serve it's Those whom he loved so you imagine the sons of Adam when God was dispersing them and sending them toward mishek and tubal and all the different places that God dispersed them God's divine order the measuring tape that God used was election the election according to Israel so from the naval of the Earth as Jews the Jews call Jerusalem the naval of the Earth from the naval of the earth God measured that way and that way and that way and that way it wasn't how big Russia was it wasn't how great Lisbon Portugal was it wasn't how great the Spanish were in Spain but God's measuring tape was the children of Israel hallu how much country you all need children how much room you need you said boy y'all y'all got y'all got a big altar here you got a big area yeah sometimes we need a lot of shouting room sometimes we need a lot of room for a lot of prayer line come on somebody don't you know how much the Lord God uses in the last day the measuring tape of the hour is God's word that he's measuring the people of the world by how much space do we need I'll tell you one of the Reas reason why that the life's day and the scientific things are the way they are because God knew we was going to need to reach the people around the world we couldn't just send brother Daryl on a boat the way that Paul traveled on but we needed the message to fall Hallelujah to be able to go and travel like a salt so right this morning people in friends are streaming this service people in Norway are streaming this service why God knew in the life I'm going to let science progress so my word can reach around the world that's how much my children need [Applause] it anybody say the devil which Dory went out of when the most high divided the Nations their inheritance when he separated the sons of Adam he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel Deuteronomy 329 for the Lord's portion is his people well I don't I'm telling you sometimes I feel like he got short changed you got to be kidding me I mean I'm talking about me you know some of y'all of course are better than I am but I'm talking about me I think man he sure got the little end of the stick as we say I got all I got from him and getting every day and still getting every day and my future is looking even brighter than my past and how much I got and he got me a flawed human being that was flawed from the time I took my first breath and will be flawed when I take my last and yet he said I want I don't want gold I don't want silver I don't want Stars I don't want constellations I want people and the prophets tell us and spoken words original SE that God predestinated a world of Sons and Daughters of God and you mean we are what he gets back wow you ever make a trade of a car or a gun or something like that you go you drive that car home and think I think I made a bad trade can I have my car back can I have my have gun back can I have oh man I'm but the way God looked at it God says no Donnie hallu I got the best part cuz he sees us as we really are Lord God for the Lord's portion is his people Jacob is the lot of his inheritance you got to be kidding me Moses would use him in his deceiver name Moses never even wrote his new name Israel Prince don't you say it magnifies the grace of God in his Jacob form God says he's mine Jacob is the lot of his inheritance he found him in a desert land and then the waste howling Wilderness that's where he found us was it brother Steve he leted him about he instructed him he kept him as the apple of his eye well I'd like to take them threes sometimes he led him about he instructed him and he kept him as the apple of his eye this is a Hebrew idiom which is not an apple hanging on a tree but it's actually the pupil in your ey so it's not something external from yourself it's a part of you it's a part of who you are oh my I was standing in front of a mirror the other day and it was one of these lighted mirrors and I was combing my hair and as I I'd wash my hair and I'd combing my hair and blowing it dry and as I stood in that mirror I saw the reflection of that lighted mirror in my eyes so in my pupils were two square light Rings one in this eye and one in that eye and what I was looking at I saw myself but I also saw what was helping me to see myself and where was it reflecting not on my fingers not on my hands my skin because there's nothing there to reflect it but I saw what I was looking at in my eyes don't you understand why we needed a profit in the last days that God could bring the eyes back on the earth that the eyes could be able to say I no longer call you church but I call you bride Hallelujah and the eyes could tell us you were with him before the foundation of the world he loved you he called you by name and the more we look into that we can say daddy that's me that's me he found him in a desert land and in a waste howling Wilderness he let him about he instructed him he kept him as the apple of his eye First Kings 8 50 Solomon's dedication prayer of the temple and forgive thy people that have sinned against thee and all the transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee and give them compassion before them who carried them captive that they may have have compassion on them I found that so amazing and looking at that yesterday that Solomon not only prayed for the compassion of God but he prayed that God would move on the hearts of the other people that was against them that they also would be able to give them compassion as well for they be thy people and thine inheritance which thou brought us forth out of Egypt from the midst of the Furnace of iron that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant unto the supplication of thy People Israel to hearken unto them and all that they call For unto thee for thou did US separate them from among all the people of the earth notice as God separated the Earth so he separated Israel to be thine inheritance as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant when thou brought us out our fathers out of Egypt oh Lord God my brother Donnie that was Old Testament Titus Chapter 2 verse 13 looking for that blessed hope and the Glorious appearing of the great God and Our Savior Jesus Christ not one of the Gods but the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ one and the same who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works look at the New Testament word now peculiar that which is one's own belonging to one's possessions a people selected by God from the other nations for his own possession so you mean God did that in the Old Testament and God can do it in the new yes he can and he did and I'm happy for it he amen amen notice in 1 Peter chap 2:9 but ye are a chosen generation eclectus eclectus elect picked out chosen by God to obtain salvation through Christ Lord have mercy you mean to tell me we are chosen by God to obtain salvation Choice select the best of its kind or class excellent preeminent now this is Peter writing in the New Testament amen ye are a chosen generation ation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people purchase possession one's own property that's why the bride wants total obedience to the Lord if the Lord says don't go here don't do this don't dress this way don't act like that way oh my church said that don't matter are you married to your church are you married to Christ the word amen A peculiar people that should show Force the Praises of him who has called you out of Darkness where to Into His Marvelous Light praise be to God oh I always as a kid whenever I was going to school I always loved looking up the meanings of words I don't know why I was a little illiterate Kentucky hillbilly I don't know why in the world I like the meanings of words maybe it's for getting ready to be a preacher years on but to me when I look up the meanings of this words it just adds so much to the word of God listen this that those of you that are called be so named to call aloud utter in a loud voice to invite to call by name to Bear a name or title among men we are not just saying we are bride but God called us to be bride God called us by name and gave us an identity Oh Glory to God which in time past were not a people but are now oh I like to preach sometime on that but now but now the people of God which is Loos tribe Nation all those who are of the same stock and language of the same stock and language how we going to know who the elect are they're going to say what the spirit has said and the prophet and the bride are saying the Oh Glory to God so they're from the same stock and they're talking the same language come on somebody they're talking like Father Talked oh my but are now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy List stand list that about one of the puniest hand claps I ever heard in my life surely you can give the Lord Jesus better than that oh my we were not a people but we are now a people of God go a tribe of the same stock of the same language yes sir all right remember them tribes in Israel and whenever there's going to be a certain code word that they would let them know that they was up on the message of the hour but certains of those people couldn't say that word so they'd say shth yeah or ciles now they knew now that's very close only one letter difference but when You' come up and they'd ask you for the word and you'd say Cil or shth they knew you were in the light of the hour cuz some people just couldn't say it well Glory aren't you glad you can say it aren't you glad you can say what God Said oh yeah you can say Oh Glory to God God sent Propet amen oh the Lord Jesus come and died for us that's well and good but you're going to have to get to a place that you can say what he said Hallelujah about you it ain't going to be enough to say what he said about the prophet of Malachi 4 for that Prophet said when the bride recognizes who she is the rapture will not come but the Rapture will gol and then brother Skippy says the coming of the Lord is a sudden secret going away sir how can a coming be a going how can a coming be a going so the coming of the Lord is a sudden secret going away so what you going to say on that ciles or shiles if God says I'm chosen I'm going to forget what I believed all my whole life I ain't no good I ain't no count I'm rotten I'll never amount to nothing come on somebody if God says I'm chosen I'm chosen if he says I'm a royal priesthood guess what I'm a royal priesthood oh but I don't feel like it brother Donnie he never said if you feel like it you are he just said you are well praise the Lord are we or not are we going to say what God says yes sir if you remember I told you years and years ago one of the greatest challenges the bribe will have in the last days is believing what God said about her or what she knows about herself and her humanity and some of you let the devil constantly beat you down and whip you down even make you question if you've got the Holy Ghost if you're born again and because there's something in you longing for more and you think you're longing for the Holy Ghost it ain't that that's all a part of perfection is in you longing for a perfect world a perfect walk and you're thinking God maybe there's something in me there's lacking there's something lacking in me it's not that it's lacking it's one of the best signs in the world that you've got it how could Perfection that was not in you long for perfection in another world thanks be to God hallelujah aren't you glad we've been called out of Darkness we've got a sister that's going to be baptized here today she turned in her testimony a while back she had been on drugs for many many years the Lord God delivered her thank you Lord she come right up here for prayer and sit right there on this side cuz she want to be delivered of something else she's dealing with she turned in the testimony here the other day the same God that took the drugs away from her took the thirst of smoking away from her that's God what an acenta we can't do it she couldn't do it herself Hallelujah what's it doing calling people out of Darkness them things that bound them and Satan thought I've got them I've got them and maybe some of our family and our loved ones we think Lord brother Donnie they've lived so often and they've said some of the aest things about the message ever was as long as they've got a breast in there there's a hope for them there ain't none of us got a predestinated magnifying glass where we can look and see if they're ordained or not God will give Grace who he wants to who are you and I to say they can't have it I've spent my whole life trying to get people saved I've spent my whole life trying to get people in church trying to get people closer to God I ain't giving up now I don't care if the sorest drunk that in Johnson City comes in here that man will come in and sit down this I figure this is one of the best places in the city for him to come and get saved and get filled with the Holy Ghost maybe your son maybe your daughter and all Brother D they've been away from God they're in terrible shape sounds like to me they need Deliverance sound like to me that our God can be able to move for them can you believe for them can you believe for your husband can you believe for your wife remember you are not only a people of inheritance but you've got one call their names call their [Music] names for such a time as this God's ordained you for this hour Hallelujah let's bow our heads together Lord God we're such a privileged People Help Us father Lord I know when the prophet read his text and gave his title is your the life worthy of the gospel and he talks about the last pool before the supper was to the blind the lame the halt the crippled well here we are Lord Jesus many of us been saved and in church for years and years help us not to be so Pious and so holy as we think we are sometimes that we'd be afraid to reach out our hand to some man or some woman Lord God they might not smell so good they might even be homeless may not have enough money to buy thems a meal but how do we know some of these homeless people around John City here might be the last one that'll come that's right help us Lord we don't have to hand them out a book we don't have to give them a seven seal book or a church age we could start with a smile we could start with a kind word as we go through the drive-thru and we order a Big Mac and they get us a fish Fil-A we order a Sprite they give us pumpkin juice now we can get mad or we can go through with the spirit of Christ and Let Jesus Express his love through the drive-thru the way he does in a message PE after all if the only good they're getting out of this church coming to church is what they have here and it don't live beyond here I am a complete failure we want Jesus to be on display on our jobs and our homes and our workplace Lord help us father A peculiar people a chosen people you purchased my right to be in divine order I believe I've been in my place for years I'm not really praying to get in my place but now I'm praying to stay in it help a lot of these people to realize it's not so much that they're trying to find it it's just staying where you've put them help us Lord Jesus I pray with every head bowed today I wonder how many of you would like to say God please help me maybe some of you're searching I know you are you come up for prayer some of our young people getting out of high school going into college whatever more and they're searching for their their place and what does God want them to be searching for a boyfriend a girlfriend a husband or a wife and they're searching for their position but some of you no doubt by the grace of God you've been able to find it but today your need is God help me that I'll stay there help me that I'll not get out of my place and if Satan comes to me with a supernatural offer which remember the prophet told us in Harvest time he would do that for those those of us who believe in the Supernatural Satan has all types of Supernatural offers that he will offer you to seduce you out of your position brother B said he may let you prophesy and it be contrary to the word he may let you speak in tongues not God the devil the devil offer you a supernatural offer to let you speak in tongues or prophesy and prophesy contrary to the word but because it would seem like a new planet a new place to start a new civilization a new world don't think your battle will stop just because you get in your place but it just begins in defending it and holding it how many of Christians say God help me keep me instruct me my hands are up Lord the Bible gives us warning If any man thinks he stand let him take heed lest he fall Lord God help me keep me Jesus keep me in my place Lord hide me oh God in the covert of your wings Lord I gave my teens to you my 20s my 30s my 40s my 50s way up now in my 60s how much every time I've got left Lord I want you to have every day I don't understand it but sometimes when preachers get older it's when they leave and get off the word Keep Me Jesus please Lord if you'd see some where I'd go to leave get off the word and be a stumbling block to your people if I'd get stubborn and hard-headed and can't be corrected take me out of this world father if you have to I don't want to be a hindrance to your people I want to help people Lord May the spirit of God move from the pulpit here to the back to the mezzanine to the nurseries to those that are streaming Lord may we realize our challenge in this day being a peculiar chosen called out people to be in our place and be identified with who we are oh how it must break your heart when some of you're redeemed and they think they're not even saved some who are sealed by the Holy Ghost and yet they're constantly coming to the Altar for the Holy Ghost help us Lord to recognize who we are yes Lord granted I pray father We Worship You Jesus Hallelujah can we who were not a people but who are now a people can raise our hands in the presence of God and let's just worship Him Now think of it some of you in those same hands years ago used to put a cigarette between them two fingers or a cigar or a pipe or marijuana or you take a needle in your hand and shoot something in your arm to try to bring you a little peace a little Joy satisfaction of life now can you raise those hands in the presence of God and thank him for what he's done for you called you by name remember I read it to you last week that he tell the Stars he knows the number of them and he calls them all by name and how much
