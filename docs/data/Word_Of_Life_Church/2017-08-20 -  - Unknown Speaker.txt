take a little time Daniel may take 21 days but the very first day you prayed I heard your prayer praise be to God my understanding this events go to the Book of Psalms chapter 23 with me god bless you certainly an honor to be in the house Lord with you tonight three let's start with verse 1 we'll read down to verse 6 and then we want to go to the Book of Revelation chapter 12 just a little evangelistic thought tonight on our heart we'd like to give to you Psalms chapter 23 verse 1 of course it's been preached on read on many different times but maybe from a little different angle tonight the Lord to help us and he's glad to be in the house of God amen the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake and the scripture tells us that God's going to have a people for his namesake but yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death when there is no light I will not fear for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou prepares a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil and we should all be able to confess that my cup it surely runneth over for surely goodness and mercy shall follow me that word follow means to chase after hunting down until it acquires you and brings you back surely goodness and mercy will bring me back all the days of my life and I'm going to dwell in the house of the Lord forever Revelation chapter 12 verse 10 and 11 of course this is coming just before the Tribulation Period and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the Kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto death I like to speak to you tonight at verse 5 of Psalms 23 and I just look at the anointed in the presence of your enemy anointed in the presence of your enemy let's just by our hearts Heavenly Father we are so thankful Lord to be gathered here in this place tonight Lord as we stand here we're asking that you would just come Lord and use us for your glory Lord you know every persons here you know every need that is represented among us tonight and we're asking that you would just come have Liberty in this place Lord we ask that the word would just come among us Lord may the light just drive the enemy from this place and Lord may you just have Liberty to be able to move upon our hearts and Lord we ask Lord that if something would be there Lord a need or whatever it might be and maybe it's a sickness we ask Lord that you would just move them those needs to not Lord might you take them from us we know that deliverance can come even by the preaching of the words for David said it Lord that you sent your word and healed them and we believe that too not Lord and we know that tonight that you're a present tense God and we believe that you're the same Lord we're not looking for some historical figure what we believe you're the same tonight may you come speak to us by your word Lord as we yield Lord in your presence nobility our own father but only what you would give us help us tonight as we look into your word and everybody said they may God bless you tonight you may have your seats for a few minutes we'll certainly try to not be before you very long we'll watch our time very closely I want to just start tonight and read as we read the book of Revelation how that the scripture is implying to us that they overcame by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony here according to John is telling us he's letting us know by prophecy for you and I that there's going to be a group of people who is absolutely going to overcome this age but he doesn't just tell us that there's going to be overcomers though we know that there is but he tells us what they're going to overcome and we know what they have to overcome is the same battle that you and I fought on a day-to-day basis we're fighting against the accuser of the Brethren and we know that even today that he is still the accuser but I have to say he can accuse but we have an atonement which has been made and that atonement stands between us and every accusation of the enemy and we know that he doesn't just tell us exactly not just that we're going to overcome he doesn't just tell us that that we're going to what we're going to overcome but he also tells us how we're going to overcome now it doesn't really matter what you face it doesn't really matter what you come against if you know how to overcome it doesn't matter really what you have to overcome if you know how to overcome and then John tells us how has the implies it to you and I'm we can look back upon that Scripture and John tells us that they had overcome him who the accuser of the Brethren they had overcome him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony now we know that a testimony is it's a powerful thing to have a testimony we can look back even through the message and we can take many different quotes and so that even my testimony many times when persons testimony it's a key to somebody else's life they here a testimony that have God done that for them and they take that same key and they use that key upon their life that if God would move for the earth and he would have respect into that faith if you can apply that same kind of a faith that God's going to move on your behalf and many kinds of many of people they look to those type of testimonies to be able to bring confidence within God that if God's done it it not that that God can do it but that God's done it before and then God sent it to somebody that you know it continues to build your faith and so there's something about it testimony that means something to us because or something about it can have a tremendous effect the testimony can have an impact upon your life but that being said if a true testimony of a true witness can have at an impact upon our life what about a negative testimony a negative testimony that would be around us now but our picks this thought up in the in the in the Psalms 23 and he's quoting verse 5 and he said oh how marvelous it is he said that this Shepherd knows beginning and ending Gentile dispensation he said no wonder David said that the Lord is my shepherd watch David begin to testify he said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want how he leads us beside the still waters and he restores my soul and our enraged are cuts over and he anoints us in the presence of our enemy did you ever get anointed in the presence of your enemy just to testify what's what it means just to testify to feel your cut just bowled over you know and you just how marvelous it is to be anointed in the presence of your enemy so being anointed gives us a testimony in this testimony is it so for that our lives are so full of what God has done we've been left with that excuse but he tells us that there's so much good things of God that he's done for us that simply our cup begins to run over now we know that's because God's provided these things and God has showed himself on our behalf maybe cos he's been so merciful to us but you realize down through biblical history you'll find that not everybody even though that was around the message of the hour those been enlightened to the truth even those that had been witnessed even delivered and seen great miracles and not always kept a positive testimony and we can look back and look at the top and see how that whenever the children of Israel had had come out of Egypt and then they come from the Red Sea or many of the people I think I do great things but did they come down to the wilderness so they come to a place of tennis Barnea and it caters for Nia there's going to be a lot of wasted years in California and I have to say I've wasted some years in caters for Nia and if you was honest you could say that you've wasted some years at caters for Nia but then sooner or later God's divine order begins to come upon our lives and somewhere along the line somebody says it's time to quit circling this mountain we've got to turn northward and get on to that promise I don't know about you but that's exactly what this message has done for us we had circled the mountain for a lot of years a lot of people had circled the message for a lot of years but eventually the revelation the son of man and the opening of the seals in the book coming open and a mighty angel descending it begins to protect our forces but more than just caters for Nia we begin to turn northward to find out what promises lays within it for a long time we rallied around Moses and my Moses had done a lot of great things that were thankful for that but there come a time that we had to move from the messenger to his message and realize he's trying to get us to have other experience with God to bring our feet to a higher plateau to bring us her house table and what we ever had been before now here they come back to us and I spent 40 years since on our forty years since our is see 40 years since God done these things and now they begin to look around and many people they start getting bored and they begin to look to other paints and people has in their mind well why don't we just go back to Egypt it really wasn't that bad neva it really wasn't that bad all I they pennis it was nice yeah we took a beating every now in the end yeah it was hard every now and then you see when deliverance cuz if we're not careful our minds begin to project that until thinkin that that was a custom Ozone paralyzed when it wasn't it was more than mortgage they cap immensely but I would have taken us God got some people who are not going back to Angel they don't have it on their mind to go back to Egypt we've got people who's ready tomorrow and we're going to take every promise of the land that belongs to us hallelujah now we come to caters for Nia and the people had gotten to the place where they are wondering about this land and they begin to think is the land really there is the land really true Dharma is the promises that Moses the prophet has made is these promises are they are they are they valid are they true and so they begin to wonder and always when time comes give a little time between the promise and fulfillment that's when people begin to wonder the time between the prophecy and the fulfillment of that prophecy is where people's minds begin to get last and they begin to go back and do things that you start to do and their eye begins to go back in before law slavery starts looking good before long go whip up the old past master begins to look do it hey Rose Horner's begin to look good but brother if you've got the spirit of pain of opponent you can we ain't going back under that dictatorship we've been under that old shoes for the better prolong time but we endured back to his ways how easy it is for spirits begin to roam around us and people begin to wonder and unbelief begins to stir because Satan's never going to leave you alone Satan's never going to quit bitin they'd never going to quit accusing you until he's passed into the lake of fire he stands before the Father day and night oh I don't know about you but I'm glad I've been through the red atonement I'm glad I post over that Red Sea I'm glad I've got something standing between me how about you tonight now they begin to wonder if the promise was really there Moses is going to send spies into the land so that the people to have an evidence that the land is there but remember for you in our faith is the substance of things hoped for I don't have to have listen friend I don't have to have the loaf of bread as long as I got the quarters because the quarter is just as good as the loaf of bread and faith is as it were but I need something tangible I need something I can put my feet on well you do got something you've got paid don't you realize abrin tells us the first person to believe God's Word was God himself he said let there be light but if he believed his old Worth and life come into existence why he stood on this pay pay every son and daughter iPods with a standoff we must stand my faith tonight oh yeah now here they come and God's going to send them into the land and he tells these Mia because it happens to be the time of the ripening of the fruit Jory's it happens to be the hour of fruit coming to harvest and he tells in this picture going into the land the grapes are coming to harvest they should be rotting on hell I want you to take and cut down a cluster of these grapes and I want you to bring an evidence back from the land so these 12 spies as they choose out one from each of these men that goes over but here's the problem every man that's going into the land is not looking to the eyes approach every man that is going into the land does not have eyes a face so when they get there they cannot deny that what the prophet has already said I hope you hear me tonight what the prophet has all blow us up what the prophet has already said lady in the land man it doesn't matter what they look like yes I had a negative confession it didn't matter what they look like God's promise was true and the Prophet message was true they come into the valley of s cool and there they find these grapes and because the Prophet is warmer than evidence hallelujah they cut down these grapes and they put the staff in between it in so much wear to me of the Bible says has to pass them back now they're under the load of the grapes they got the grapes over their shoulders they feel the weight of the grapes they feel the weight of the prophecy they feel the weight of what Moses has said I was in sit at the Landers for with new can honey and now they're under the load carrying back to promise back to the children of Israel don't you see when you pack this word today we are under the load of the word I caught we are under the load of opposites we're in it back as evidence they get a pretty good spectrum of what ladies in the land but all Caleb and Joshua has on their mind is war belongs to them they're tired of talking about a gospel they're tired talking about a job it was their partner talking about it God it used to be they are ready to achieve the promise but I don't know about you I do not want to be stuck in haters fornia I want to make sure I've got my eyes with the promise of God I am not satisfied in the desert I am not satisfied out here I'm not satisfied being a desert baby I want to be a child of Canaan I want to be the children of God children of promise who's able to march into the land ever got given right there belongs to me [Applause] these men passed these grapes back how can imagine if they come walking back into the camp no doubt the minds of the people wondering is it true what has been said until they see these two men with the staves over their cellars packing back these great big old grapes their men now maybe some of the same people who had talked about how nice it would be to go back and have you brought it out here into this desert to die maybe as they begin to look at them grapes they can manage them grapes look good I mean their breaks was pretty good I'd like to have one of them rate I'm is just one of would be me and my whole family and my uncle my great-great uncle it Pete everybody my families I just have one of them well why would you want to sit around and enjoy the blessings of God just with one grapes when you've got a promise that all of them belongs to you why would we want to sit around the message and just take pieces and parts of it when God has promised at the land that is full of them where you can build your house right the size a very harvest for the great and not only you all listen Prius but every son and daughter of God can enjoy the benefits of the land I do not want to be guilty but just hanging around the promises I want to testimony within me that not only in those grace goods but I'm going to get my own bit you're going days you come back here often is already total by the words nobody said if the land is good but now we're going to have a testimony service testimony services can't just be real good now I was raised up in a smaller church and we had popcorn services but people was able to testify we start testifying this building tonight will be here the same time next week but it always amazed me the testimony service that when you call on people's names sometimes they just freeze up they just lock up but you let people volunteer to testify and you let somebody start testify about what God did for them that testimony triggers a positive response in the mind of others come on somebody and he begins to remind them that God did something similar for me he almost did the very same thing for me and before long that positive testimony has attracted another positive testimony and the fire begins to spread through the church and compile and you got yourself search going on no doubt Moses is expecting these men to say something good he was expecting the Prophet listen Moses had no doubt were laid in the land Moses didn't wonder what was running in the land it was those who had unbelief on their hearts was wondering what's in the land Moses had already said that not only are they going to have a testimony service they've got the spoken word of Moses but now not only do they have the spoken word of Moses they got the manifested words of Moses they've got physical evidence that the land is good they've never seen graves like this in it in each of you know why they can't grow grapes like this in Egypt Greylock death only flows in the land of promise so not only do they have the spoken word they are standing upon the manifested word of their day he's expecting testimonies of joy he's expecting to hear testimonies of milk and honey testimony of power testimonies of overcoming expecting to hear great things that God has done the people has gotten doubt in their hearts don't have ears to hear what the Spirit is saying it is some of the preachers that come around the message they begin to fall back light on their own hearts they met somebody and they're not convinced and that means they're not concerned and because they're not convinced and concern they're not looking at the positive God's word all they can see is how big this any time how big the walls are helping the Giants on how big the chariots are they are not looking what the pump is there to look at and so here they come back and fill up more matter than Hornets they come in there they are so discouraged they are so down pull out their hankies like it's a funeral because they fit they fail to recognize what the Prophet had already said I said they failed to catch the revelation of the land they went there with unbelief in their hearts and because of unbelief being in their heart the unbelief in their heart has limited their vision to the promises of God's Word don't you see when you read the word day in and day out if there is an unbelieving your heart somewhere it will limit you from seeing the promises of God that belongs to you as a child of God if we are reading all that we must read it by faith we must read it by believing God's word that that promise belongs to me it may not just be my brother or my sister but it's me O Lord standing in the prayer that promise is a personal promise to me we come back and they get a negative testimony and their fix they have a testimony service I failed to recognize what Moses had been doing which was established in a relationship between them and God again I said he was restoring the relationship a man Church he's restoring the relationship that Abraham had had with God baby all my Moses was resembling the relationship between them and God again because they didn't have the right kind of relationship in Egypt and you can't have the right kind relationship and even you can't tell me these people that live in Egypt in our part of Asia or feeding on the same thing that you and I are feeding on that's not the right kind of fellowship that's not the right kind of worship but brother you get out here in the land and you start taking your feet up and putting them down but the promise of God's Word that's real testimony to me hallelujah he wants us to know him he wants us to know him not in just sermon form not in just past reform not in just book form not in just hate form he wants us to know him in a living reality he wants us to recognize he's not a God of just yesterday he's the same God right now don't you see princess what Moses his ministry was to do was to bring the people back to a personal relationship with God [Music] that's why I say attach this message that's why you text the validity of this message that's why I attach the promises of this message amen I had been anointed to believe this message I've been anointed to preach this message you've been anointed to believe this message you've been in order to preach this message some does in the pulpit some does in the kitchen some does in the job some doesn't the cafeteria come on somebody some you doing after school some you do there all kinds of places but we are all called a God to test the part that the good things of God don't you see that's the way our lives should be we should be a walking living testimony and I know what you say sometimes you ain't wash you pronounce the air it's not the articulation of your word sometimes it's alive live by the gospel let people pick up something if you want about your life I've been anointed from the presence of my enemy you don't matter how many and Malikov stains against us it doesn't matter how many jetties that stands against us it doesn't matter how many's gonna come I get the message of that we are anointed in the permit of our enemies I'm in order to talk about the good things of God you're annoying to believe the good things are gone Island I need to preach about the Blood alanine is a freak about the Holy Ghost after how major disaster is or width odds [Applause] who cares what they say when we got evidence of the land I've been anointed to overcome by the word of my testimony and I'll just ask tonight who's on the Lord's side among you I told him he says it's control who's on the Lord's side of of you I'll tell you just while I'm standing right with you Caleb I'm gonna stand right beside you believe it's the gather round there's going to be a testimony service pastor standing there banjos are there deacons are there to me and strong and here comes a testimony service well also make this letter so uh exactly just to kick this off what didn't you see in the land well let me just tell you what I saw I saw whole cities I saw breath you wouldn't believe how hard the trip was I mean it was so tough it was so rough I'm getting discouraged thinking about it and there ain't no way are you kidding me this is what we've been believing all these years you mean to tell me we've been following this all these years and that's what we got to look forward to and Joshua says yes Amen come come down just for some turn to testify what you see up there by these I'll tell you what I saw I saw the children of a Mack I saw me and that are twice the size of any person here and I'm not just talking about any man these me and carry swords taller than you are they got great shoes oh they're well learned Mia they are warriors from their youth and we're nothing but factory workers and housewives [Applause] funny hats and we are coming to you like this we'll just let me balance this out let me tell you what I saw please do I saw Jericho and that was all I needed to see when I seen how big Jericho was that was it just something up in my mind when I seen the size of the walls were big enough to have chariot races around the top of it that summed it all up in my mind I thought we might as well find somewhere else to go in because it's ain't core to work you mean to tell me you found one negative thing around this message and you're ready to throw in the towel well not me [Music] you by one story you can't comprehend you found one quote you don't understand you buy one thing in the message you find a little phone don't you realize if you go looking for fault that state to show you every mistake he'll show you every sort coming don't you see that's exactly what they try to do invade us to get him to see all the folks of the people all the fault of the message and we know how that worked out for him see a little hand in the back raised up and said I think I need to testify

church manners now I'm going to call this Pentecostal man told me that one time so but they don't tell what your problem is your to Pentecostals that's where your problem is your to church Christ I would rather be a little Pentecostal now now let me just be honest I'd rather be a whole lot difficult I can't help it I love when the presence of God comes by I love what he company moves right here in this earth I love to hear the war cry I love to hear the Indian cry - I love and God comes by any stairs from the back of the gun to the president I love your presence I am anointed in this presence and I love to be in it if it makes me cross so be it if it makes me shouts over here if it makes me dance so be it if I could just dead lift my hands to it and just tell him how great he is I love to be in it nice it's not one tripping the cane and look at him Moses I want to be as far away from that fanatic can I bring it down our terminology holy rollers I can give you don't have to wear that attitude you won't be there anyway [Applause] yeah was brother let somebody else on the boat be the knight here I've seen overcoming power in the land I sing joy unspeakable and full of glory now wait a minute did you not see waltzes yeah I saw and I thought man what am new that's going to what a miracle that's gonna be I mean can you imagine he to the knot Jericho flat down to the ground what kind of a miracle that's going to be why did it is me helping the walls when I did I kept looking at home ah when God get the hold in that devil he's going to take every stone he's going to rip one now for the other until they are ashes under the soles of our feet but did you see something fearful oh I seen something fearless well you have to admit we need a little bit more than this message to do it don't worry now everything I had needed lays right in this message but we need more than the Bible all know everything I need is right here don't you see what these men are doing for planting seeds in the minds of these other people their testimony is so negative that a negative testimony will impact your life the prophet calls them borderline believers they had enough faith to get to the border but they could not go over I want never to be found guilty of being a borderlines believer I know he got a lot of them around the message but I don't want to be one the Evangelist is just trying to pull out of me about borderline things god help me but I say we got rights this message is more than enough matter of fact I don't need 49 to 65 just give me one quote well that's all David needed to fight a giant I don't need 5,000 scriptures so he given to me I'll need a hundred thousand posts will he give it to us all I need is warm hey man when you recognize this messages eagle food when the bride recognizes who she is near the rapture is going to go brother we have got God his confident in his word he's confident in what he's promised he's confident in his blessings [Applause] but sometimes we look at our enemy completely different than what our enemy looks at us look at tonight we can break into the enemy's camp and find out what the enemy has to say about children of promise it may change our thinking a little bit I like to go across Jordan I like to go behind the laws of this great city called Jericho and the Bible says in John 4 to 8 before they were lay down she came up to them on the roof speaking about Rahab she said to them I know what some of those folks over there across the way needs to the left I know that the Lord has given you the land she ain't been around the message of two days and she's got more revelation and most of them oh yeah I've heard it ever since I was a kid preacher sellout when I was really a kid preacher 17 you know what's wrong with these young whippersnappers coming in here talking about open book and seals and punters and hood what and why can't they just satisfy with in business she has more I don't you see for him if you don't get on board this train is not waiting I don't care if you minute in 10 years 20 years 50 years the gospel revelation is not waiting a minute or a minute coming into the message in two years no more and some people never heard it 30 get me so more leave here Lord I know the Lord's giving you the land and that's your terror has fallen on us and then all the inhabitants of the land are throwing birthday parties they got balloons and little hats and little if you listen to these negative testimonies that's the way it looks the inhabitants of the land not just the finish not just the city she's heard some rumors that the inhabitants of the land faint because and you thought that you was just another message believe worship if you thought she was just another person's will come and sit on the pews and then go back home you didn't realize the inhabitants of the land are scared how do you know this one but we have hired and faith cometh by we have hired and how the Lord dried up part of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt I love it when they start quoting our history [Applause] now listen most of these peoples was born right out there in that desert they were desert babies they've been raised around the message hey my dad heard babies but because they're falling the same pillar fire in the same cloud their identification runs back before their birth [Applause] that's good I said my identification run my previous Oh God my testimony runs previous to my birth it's because I am identified with this method I'm identify with all it is how identified in all of its glory we had heard how the Lord comes lo Rd try that the one of the Red Sea for you when you come out of Egypt and what you did why you here God did it but they're getting the credit that would help us right there the next devil you fight God's going to do it come on somebody he's just going to you use her to the through he needs a hand he needs you feet he need eyes what you did in two - two kings of the a mirage that were on the other side of Jordans he said sound and all whom you utterly destroyed I love to give you that definition is just too good verse 11 and as soon as we heard these things our hearts melted hot butter on a hot fire you see just milk and so much neither did that remain any more courage in any man because because I hope this helps you tonight because for the Lord your God amen my cup runneth over right now hang on for the larger God He is God in heaven above and in in now nurse a nurse but I'm gonna need a little bit more I'm glad you asked Joshua 5:1 they came to pass one of the kings of the am rats were thrown this side of Jordan westward all the kings of the cane that's which we're about to see hurt that the Lord had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel until until we were passed over their heart did not neither was there any spirit in them anymore because think about it because of the children just was six one their first battle and Jericho was straightly shut up because of the children of Israel none went out and none came in they locked the doors [Music] remember on the cartoons years ago when they would lock a door they locked they kept they have flat locks the door I'm talking about they put boards on it they nailed it shut they put the dresser against it they put the refrigerator you see they put the stove against that we want nobody coming through these doors and the puppet said the reason why is because they felt like they would secure behind their loss mother walls can't keep you from the hand to God I've got to walk through walls he can walk through soul a man he can walk no one writes about our gods scared to death Israel but will you listen to this testimony service this don't match up unless you get some believers among Jews and all I can say is these believers was carrying the whole bunch in it's sad when a few people's got to carry a whole church wouldn't it be said that a Donny Reagan had to carry this whole church come on somebody he our refusal let him preach by herself I refuse to just sit and be a watcher in a gator I'm called to be a participator I am here to get something from God and ain't nothing standing in my way oh let me just tell you I wanna pull from what I got need in this place 50 headed if Donny Reagan hola can we gonna pull his gas out shouldn't that be the way it is when a man of God stands behind the pulpit you you ain't standing between me and my promise brother you might as well get ready I'm getting what I have need of [Applause] these people are scared to death of interest because they had heard what your hova had done I love you they'd heard how god it opened up earthly they heard how God had fought kings and Kings had been demolished and trampled under their feet so they locked the door both ladies if I could just know that the devil looks at me that way it would really help me it just so happened I found a quote for you if you can see to the eyes of this testimony perhaps this Jesus cost the same not with I believe don't like this that the devil tramples when the weakest of thanks goes to their knees and I'll put my name right there for most of the time but I am a saint no oh no I'm not a sinner I was one not now what a power and privilege has been given to the Church of the Living God when you fall to your knees in prayer even the Devils tremble to the weakest of the only they're scared to death because they heard what God was doing they hear that God can clear the way no matter how big the opposition is they heard that God can feed them when there was no food nowhere around out a mill of a desert they heard that God fed them miraculously they heard that their clothes and never wore out and they heard that no enemy can stand before them I've got ahold of that tonight amen and we as the Church of the Living God has got the same thing right in the presence of your enemy the enemy has to testify that God is with you there's things that he cannot even figure out that he has to say God has to be with them you may not realize it but you are recognized in him you are recognized in health program says let alone in the other night they was talking about here from the may hope so completely go that she was laying on a stretcher and the Holy Spirit got ahold of her and healed her right there she got up and was so happy she couldn't even sleep all night when the Mayo Clinic had given her up just a few nights ago what is that that's yielding and this man when he seen Jesus coming perhaps the devil tore his my to run out there and to get Jesus because no one could pass by but when the demon got close to the Lord Jesus Christ he recognized who it was now say they don't recognize you because they do they do do you believe that Devils recognize Christians man these folks behind the walls and recognized and your enemy recognizes who you are sometimes it takes somebody God give us somebody who can stand in the midst and be a voice against all others and it takes place if we have to stand let us stand David's a man that knew something about fighting battles he knew what it was to go through hard trials David would have been killed immediate hurts but David in Psalm 23 wrote some powerful words the David would have to recognize my testimony but he begin to confess and he said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside still waters the psalmist is letting us know that he like a sheep the Lord has condescended and he's become my shepherd David has recognized the condensation of God to be a shepherd over every sheep David is telling us think of that David had been exiled and David represents Israel did you know one man can represent a whole church [Music] did you know one man in battle can represent a whole nation whenever when David went to fight a lot he was one man but if David overcome every time Israel overcome with David because what person can represent everybody else one person can top everybody else and David said the Lord is my shepherd yes what could say the Lord is our Shepherd for Israel had been bound in Babylonian captivity preached somebody and one man like David represents all of Israel and as the Israel was in Babylon they got let out and they could say the Lord is my shepherd think about it then verse 3/5 not only have they come out of her they got restored for David said he restoreth my soul he lead him in the path of righteousness for his name's sake in other words God has brought me back from the grave he's brought me back to life many a days I should have been gold should have been way so the way but he took my soul and he raised me up and he kept me I should have been cast down I should have been destroyed that he restored me back he's letting me know God is a restorer of the dead can you say the same thing tonight David say yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow now remember they can't be a shadow less there's a lot though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I don't have to fear nothing though I walk beside Jericho I have nothing to fear though I walk among Giants I have nothing to fear no I walked through layana's here I have nothing to fear because thou art with me hallelujah David is telling us he's a present it's God with me right now that no matter what our through he's a present-tense god man look what deliverance has done for the testimony of David if he can keep me in the valley if he can keep me in despair if he can keep me in trouble tell me what he can't keep me from if he can keep me from those pain he's kept me from death tell me why my God can't do if you got the Holy Ghost you possess the same shepherd David did and therefore I will not fear for thou art with me and then David comes to this you told my partner because thou prepares to a table before me in the presence of mine enemies I like that he's topping this table with a feast and David is telling them this ain't no ordinary meal this is a feast he's brought me out he kept me he's raised me for his namesake he's restored me amen and then he's put a banqueting table in front of me I'm sitting at the feast of our God Prison ain't just some little meal something's just got pulled together it ain't some little piece of food this ain't mac knodel troffers this is a piece for king of beasts fit for a king may I say to you tonight God has not given the bride just a little bread and water to make it for next week and maybe the next week and maybe the next month we've not been just given enough to survive we've said it a feast he's prepared before me a feast from 49 to 65 he set before me on this table a feast row after row after row of heavenly delights of reveal words sent from Almighty God himself he has sent me heavenly the last and so I can feed upon and I can take him when I begin to eat my strength comes back yes I've had to fight but I got enough food to restore my straight back and notice where it's all happening at not in the presence at the enemy so the enemy could just sit on the outskirt lord who needs that much food anyway who really needs all that I do what some other is going to go away that's a good he wants to make sure I got funny ways are you kidding me this is the manna that under this iconic lorry it's just as good in 49 and it is it's what he is giving me he'll be the same good as funny in 80 because it's under the Secada light but in front of your enemies you're eating feast feast brings laughter face was a cup of a celebration remember year after they come out of eat that they held the feast to remind them of what God had done I think it's good to be reminded what God has done it helps your testimony what the brains are unspeakable look at the things that's been given to bash and they overcome by the blood of lamb another word of their testimony and bring celebration because revelation 12:12 says therefore rejoice after they overcomes F to the battle come milk is Nick ask to the battles after the battle they rejoiced after the battle their joy until John has some say that far fix you overcome therefore rejoice you heavens and ye that twelve give them and then he gives a warning to the tribulation Saints whoa into the inhabitants of the earth so just before the tribulation just after the battle they somebody overcoming Peleliu you is justifying what are you doing celebration testifying what God is done testifying how great he is God prepared a feast he makes the enemy sit around and watches god feed you with blessings and mercy and love he accuses you day and night and got violent he tries to make you feel guilty tries to condemn you every every time you hear Judas you think oh god that's me that's what the devil does to you makes you think of a negative report but the enemy has to sit around and he watches you after your mistake after your fault he watches God give you a big spoon full of grace says open up here it comes but I don't understand I know they did this I know they was given I know the history of that we never said was deserving hey man listen for him to say something you work for this ain't something you achieved grace is a gift he gives you grace he gives you mercy he gives you love a man because you're his child something you merited you got children at home you don't feed them because do you want something back from you feed them because you love them and right in the presence of our accuser God provides us unmerited favors a man then the president's your enemy he watches every bit of it amen and God didn't just provide the feast when everything is going good but he still gives me a feast when everything's going wrong you remember the prodigal after everything he went wrong the father met him I said the father met him he ran and met him and when you do something wrong when they choose her pounces you like a lion he starts your money of your past reminding your mistakes amen but it's been you can testify in the presence of your enemies that the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want that's when you can testify how great God's love is how great God's mercy is but to be Kyser desiring now even when I'm not deserving he loves me anyway hallelujah hidden their wonderful friends now prepares the table before me and the presence of my enemies must enter feast hence the scripture says and the scripture says thou anointest my head with all which we know by the message of course that's the custom they take the oil and it's mixed for the perfume and it's a sign to make them welcome that they anoint you with this all glory and David said when I come to his table he was there ready to anoint me with you and David the man that knows something about being anointed with all David remembers how it felt when the prophet Samuel had anointed him as a king and poorly all from the top of his head to the bottom of his feet and David said he's prepared me a feast in the mister - and he anointed me withal and I say Amen and David says but I ain't done yet because my god which is an Eastern custom that when you would come in they put a cup in your hand and they begin to pour the wine and they wouldn't just fill it all the way up they would fill it until it runs over the top of it and starts pouring down the ground to let you know there's plenty there's plenty of this oh there's there's vast full of drink all you want you're so welcome to come and to eat at my table I want you to know that you could eat in plenty you can rest in peace and you can have all you need to drink and David says having to come to his table he refreshed me with the oil that re-energized me until finally I have to say like the cup bearer bringing me the cup overflows if you can't say that tonight some drunk if you can't testify that tonight whether you sin right no troubles you say no battles I'm saying it because there is and look who's the one fighting Mossad you that's got the rod and the staff to lead you and us in the ride two guys our feet and say dollar with me aspire heart so now if you look up and mercy all praise be to God and the presence of your enemy you've been anointed enemy look at your life maybe can't figure it out because he knows you're not deserving and the mystery is you know you're not either but why does God keep giving mercy and grace and love and showing favor and partiality why does he keep doing it because he's my shepherd David knew something about tending sheep and David know that when the Sheep would go astray he'd leave the ninety and nine and go get the one and bring it back into the thought it's because David was commissioned to watch over daddy's sheep what kind of a shepherd would David have been if David would have come back to his daddy they saw son house all the sheep there were dead they're all dead but everything's good oh no David knew if I had to give my own life amen these are my sheep hallelujah so our heads are bowed our eyes is closed maybe you've not been able to testify have you been through a battle maybe a trial may be trouble maybe something was said tonight let's reminded you I want to tell you tonight you are anointed in the presence of your innovation sure in order to stand your no need to keep believing don't give in don't give out don't give up don't stop believing believing it's hard I know it's hard to keep pressing keep fighting keep look beside you look around you but ever I feel about myself but you're not oh if you could only look the largest said Lord Allah has said Lord open either this boy let him see how many surrounding you if you only knew think about how your enemy looks to
