[29:42] [Applause]
[29:51] king praise the
[29:54] lord we greet you tonight in the name of
[29:56] the Lord Jesus
[29:58] and we're gathered here people with
[30:02] mixed
[30:04] emotions in our
[30:06] heart and one part of it we Rejoice
[30:09] because our sister has made it safely
[30:13] home no more suffering no more pain no
[30:17] more battling a demon called
[30:19] cancer safely In the Arms of Jesus this
[30:23] evening and yet another part of our
[30:25] hearts is sad because it Le an empty
[30:30] place and so we gather here as a people
[30:33] and you can just you can sense it in in
[30:35] the building you can
[30:36] sense and you think did did did we
[30:41] fail we prayed we we we believed and was
[30:46] our faith not good
[30:48] enough no friend that's not the case at
[30:52] all you see when I was in the Army we
[30:54] had a general order and we had a direct
[30:58] order and general order would be like if
[31:01] you pass an officer you salute him
[31:04] that's a general order that you just
[31:06] done that if you didn't do that they'd
[31:07] write you up they'd find you but then
[31:10] there would come a direct order that is
[31:12] like in combat you wouldn't salute an
[31:14] officer because the enemy would see that
[31:17] that was an officer and they would try
[31:18] to take him out that was a direct order
[31:21] and so our general orders was you pray
[31:23] for the sick you believe you lay hands
[31:25] on them they shout that's our general
[31:27] orders and we done those we carried out
[31:29] those orders that God left for
[31:32] us but there come a direct order from
[31:35] God that said it's time for my daughter
[31:37] to come
[31:38] home and that supersedes all general
[31:41] orders so you say well did we no we
[31:43] didn't
[31:44] fail and we're not sad tonight because
[31:46] we feel like God failed
[31:49] us we're just sad because of the empty
[31:52] place that's left in our
[31:54] hearts and you know death is not
[31:56] something that's new new to this
[31:58] church there's people sitting here who's
[32:01] lost mothers myself we've buried my
[32:03] father my mother my brother my
[32:05] father-in-law my
[32:07] sister-in-law many of you brother Joel's
[32:09] mother pass others
[32:10] here brother Lily different ones so
[32:14] death is not something that's new to
[32:16] this
[32:17] church and all the Death that we've
[32:19] dealt with here we've had a pastor and a
[32:22] family who's Comfort us they've come to
[32:24] our homes and they've prayed for us and
[32:25] they've encouraged us
[32:28] and now it's time for us to comfort
[32:32] them it's time for us to
[32:35] repay and so tonight you know we could
[32:37] have took a sermon and preached but I
[32:40] talked to Brother JD and I said you know
[32:41] I think it would be good if we would
[32:43] just get together come together as a
[32:45] family of God and just have a little
[32:48] time of
[32:49] prayer and so I feel like tonight that
[32:52] that's Brother JD said you know I was
[32:54] thinking the same thing and so tonight I
[32:55] think it would be good for us just to
[32:57] take this service to pray together and
[33:02] to pray for the brother rean and his
[33:05] family brother Parker and his
[33:08] family brother Scotty and sister Alicia
[33:10] the
[33:11] Babs and pray for one
[33:14] another for in the days ahead we're
[33:16] going to need each other more and more
[33:17] and more you see what's happening to
[33:20] Israel where it looks like there's enemy
[33:22] on every side of them they parallel us
[33:24] friends we Paul said there's trouble on
[33:27] every side not just one side but every
[33:29] side and we've never needed each other
[33:31] like we need each other
[33:33] now and so tonight I just want to take
[33:36] this time for prayer and you want to
[33:37] brother Larry's going to play some soft
[33:39] music you want to pray here at the altar
[33:40] you're welcome you want to kneel right
[33:42] there in your chair where you're at
[33:43] you're welcome to do that too and if you
[33:46] want to pray 5 minutes 10 minutes 20
[33:48] minutes or an hour it's totally up to
[33:51] you there's nobody here it's not a
[33:52] measuring Rod to see who can pray the
[33:53] longest that's not what it's about but
[33:56] but it's just a time that we can come
[33:58] together as a family and pray for one
[34:01] another and pray for brother rean and
[34:03] him because how many
[34:05] prayers has he prayed for
[34:07] us would that be all right
[34:10] tonight
[34:11] amen so that's what we want to do and
[34:14] when you're finished praying and you
[34:16] feel like you've prayed what's on your
[34:18] heart there there'll be no formal
[34:20] dismissing so you don't have to get up
[34:21] and wait you can just get up and slip
[34:24] out and remember the uh
[34:27] services this weekend I think the
[34:29] viewing will be at 11: the funeral will
[34:31] be at 1: and then the graveside service
[34:33] will follow that over at the Happy
[34:35] Valley Cemetery I think that's I think
[34:37] that's right but do you love him
[34:41] tonight isn't it wonderful to to be a
[34:44] where would we be friends when we deal
[34:45] with things like this if we didn't have
[34:48] the
[34:49] Lord and you know one thing that always
[34:51] comforted
[34:53] me when we dealt the loss of of brother
[34:57] Homer and Rachel you know 8 8-year-old
[35:01] and and brother bam talks about that a
[35:04] girl that he dated when they were young
[35:06] and I think she had married some maybe a
[35:08] minister or something like that say
[35:09] she's a Godly girl and brother Brenham
[35:12] was away at a meeting and she had took
[35:14] sick and passed and brother Brenham says
[35:17] I believe it's in the adoption series my
[35:18] memory serves me right but brother
[35:20] Brenham said that he said I slipped down
[35:22] to the funeral home before the crowd
[35:23] just to pay my respects to
[35:25] her and he said when I went beyond the
[35:28] curtain of time he said I saw her over
[35:33] there there's a land beyond the river
[35:38] FR and we are a people who have a
[35:43] hope that we plant our loved ones he
[35:46] will raise them up
[35:48] again and we will all Gather in at
[35:50] Daddy's house and sit around Daddy's
[35:53] table and he'll wipe the tears from her
[35:55] eyes you you see he's a man the Bible
[35:58] said he's a man acquainted with
[36:01] sorrow grief he knew what it was he wept
[36:04] at the grave of Lazarus so he
[36:06] understands tonight what we
[36:08] feel so let's just let's just sing a
[36:11] little Little Chorus and then if you
[36:14] want to come to the altar you're welcome
