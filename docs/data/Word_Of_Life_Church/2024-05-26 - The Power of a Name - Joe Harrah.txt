prayer father for the The Ward Family the Archer family Lord that you would give them abundant peace Lord we pray that you would comfort them in the time Lord that passing of sister Judy Lord I pray for the the Phillips Family Lord and those Lord God in still graving of the passing of brother Jerry father we invite you this morning we welcome you and we ask that in Jesus name amen amen if you have your Bibles you going turn with me we'll read two scriptures uh ma we're going to read in Malachi chapter 1 10 and 11 then we'll turn down to Mark 16 Malachi it says who is there even among you that could shut that would shut the doors for not neither do the Kindle Fire on mine Altar for not I have no pleasure in you say the Lord of hosts neither will I accept an offering at your hand for from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name and a pure offering for my name shall be great among the Heathen sayith the Lord of hosts that's you and me we are we are the Gentiles that he said that he would place his name amongst and it would be great amongst the Gentiles Mark 16 we'll read 15-8 and he said unto them go ye into the world and preach the gospel to every creature and he that believeth in his baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up servants serpents and if they drink in the deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover you can be seated may the Lord bless his word this morning I I'd like to speak on a on a thought the power of a name and we read there in Malachi we know at this point God had wanted for many years and generations to put his name amongst the children of Israel that was they were his people they were his love and and every time that he would want to put his name there they would turn against him we we you look at the children of Israel their Journey out of out of Egypt and how they turned against God and all that and God still forgave him many times and gave him the land that they that they wanted and fought their battles for him and then they turn him down and he would bring them back still a great desire and and that's kind of what he does you and I sometimes so many times God wants to to move in your life to put his name in your life there's no greater name the Bible says there's that's the name that all should be saved there's no greater name on Earth that's the name you're healed by that's the name you're delivered by that's the name you get Redemption by and God wanted to give that name to them and they would not and then he says from the rising of the sun even going down the same my name shall be great amongst the Gentiles brother brandom said in Mary's belief oh Lord as we Fellowship around these things know that it's not just some kind of a story it's not some kind of a mythical story or Superstition among people but he is alive tonight he's here tonight just as real as he was in Galilee he cannot fail his name has been given above every name in heavens and earth all the family if you are family is named Jesus you have been given his name you know when you look at it when you me and brother brother darl was talking all ago there's so many people in churches Millions around the world this morning that have gathered in what they would call his name they have prayed in his name for the prayer request that come forth they have bowed their head and said Lord would you meet with us here today they'll even go out to eat and they'll pray for their food in his name but they are not in his name right you know we we we we look at that and and they they claim they belong to them you know we look at how Jesus how God wanted to put his name in the church and we we know we revelation we read in Revelations we see what happened to the church how God put away put her away because she would not and we we look at that and in and people that are sitting sincere people are sitting in churches this morning denominational churches praying in his name believing he'll come believing he'll he'll move in the service for them and he might but he does not recognize them as his wife same thing is happening in mess's churches they walk in they sit down they pray over the prayer request they invite him Lord be with us this morning be with us tonight and then they don't give him anything they don't give him the worship the Adoration the praise that he deserves amen do you realize that's that's what all God wants from us is fellowship we've said that if you don't know that by now that's all God wants from us is fellowship that's why he put his name in you so you would with fellowship with him trying to do God a service brother BR said there's only one meeting place where God meets man one meeting place and that's when he's in Jesus Christ and the only way that you are in Jesus Christ if Jesus Christ has put his name in you that's the only way he'll meet you there so you can't come in the form of of denomination of the Harlot and say I want to meet with you Jesus they had their chance and they turned him away yeah you know just because you you say that you're in the name we look at how Paul talks about the the Vagabond Jews there in Acts 19 what what would the the Jew what were they doing they were trying to cast out demons in Jesus name they were they were doing seemed like a good work they were they were telling these demons to come out in the name of Jesus that's what they're doing a message churches right now and Jesus don't know them this is what they're doing they're trying to cast out demons they're trying to heal the sick they're trying to deliver people in jesus' name and what did what did what did these demons these demons spoke back to these Jews and told them Jesus we know Paul we know but who are you if the devil don't know you you probably don't have the the name right that's who he knows he knows Jesus and if Jesus has become a part of you in here if you have taken the name what have we been hearing preached in the last two three months about Boaz given his name to Ruth that's what Jesus has done for you he's giving you his name he's he's found that place and they said that's the only place where God will meet you he won't meet you in a building he won't meet you just because you're a good person some of the finest people I know I've worked with with some denominal Christians that put some of us to shame their moral their moral compass is is is set so straight you can't touch their life with anything except they don't have the name they haven't accepted the name and you've got people sitting in churches pushing play thinking they're doing it in Jesus name yeah preach it brother it's not just about asking him to meet your needs it's about being in his name amen that's where the power comes from God knows who his bride is in 2 Timothy 21 19 it says nevertheless the foundation of God stand ass sure having the seal the Lord know knoweth them that are his let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity so if you're praying in his name you're saying I mean his name your life will show it your your life will show that that you're not that you've taken the name right by the fruits you'll know them the works that you'll do if you're in his name you will do the same works that he did when Jesus said I'll go away but I'll come back and when I come back I'll be with you even in you Greater Works than this shall you do why because that name is in you that's the power of the name it ain't you you have no abilities we can lay our hands on on the sick you've got something how many times do people come up to to be in prayer with in the prayer line brother Brandon and brother Brandon would catch that that they had something in their life they had unconfessed sin in their life the name couldn't move with that sin there that unconfessed sin amen the name takes that away the Redemptive part of the name takes that away but people walk up before before the prophet and he says you've got unconfessed sin in your life you know sometimes you wonder if that's why things in our life a ain't happening we got things in our life shouldn't be there we got things you you you come in you're asking you're praying for God to do this praying for God to do that check your life is your life lining up with the name if he is in you the works that he do you will do it's not you anyway it's it's not it's not about us it's it's not the the the life that we live every day we're good people if God is in you you will do what he does his light will reflect out of your life amen I think we take it for granted sometimes it becomes tradition even praying over food becomes tradition you know I'm guilty I'm guilty I say some quick prayers over my food CU I'm hungry we all do yes and then some of you be honest you're saying the same prayer you've been saying for the last 40 years oh my come on I amen yes but it becomes tradition do we do we sit and think about what we're saying amen do we take the the one that gave us the name do we take it for granted we we want to we want to ask him for things Lord we help us we're going on a trip keep us safe travels we do that we say our nightly prayers we get down at night and we say our prayers Lord thank you for the day help us to have a good sleep wake me up safely in the morning or however you do yours but it becomes tradition and we don't realize this this name that we're taking for granted and do you realize what the name has done for you do we realize what you received when you took on the name and so many times we give him back so little let me ask you if you if you were on a heart transplant list and doctors gave you three months and they found a heart for you and you you received a heart from somebody and they said this heart will probably let you live another hundred years how grateful would you be for the person that donated that heart how grateful and yet you you got somebody that has donated eternal life to you eternal life in his name he giving it to you do we wake up every morning thinking about that do we wake up every morning and say Lord thank you for the day and then all all right away we start thinking about the stuff we have to do that day and we don't think about him again till lunchtime when we say our little traditional prayer over our food we don't think of him again until we sit down at supper we say the same prayer we said at lunch yeah and then we lay down and we say the same prayer we've been saying for 30 years as we go to sleep it's tradition we take the name that's been given to us for granted amen we get caught into Traditions whenever you whenever you receive that name change you will receive if you truly have received a name change it will change your character it will change your character who is your character your character is who you are it is who you are it's your personality what God has given you when you were born you take you you take drunkards murderers thieves when they receive the true baptism of the Holy Ghost it changes their characters let me let me tell you something me me and brother Robert around these these youth every week very often through the year and and through many of them you can ask brother Rob and some of these other young men the changes that we've seen in these youth's character over the past year that it's supernatural their desires have changed their appearances have changed their looks have changed their their their speech has changed the things they desire have changed because they had a name change yeah God took who they was and removed it and put himself in there that's a name change that's how God that's how God changes your nature changes your character is he removes who you are and puts himself in there brother brandom says in time tested Memorials of God when you come to Christ you don't Absolut if you can't absolutely sell out Lock Stock and Barrel and come to Christ don't come at all if you can't give him everything amen don't give him anything there is no halfway with God you know we all we all knew Who We Are by ourselves how are you by yourself what do you do when you're by yourself what are your actions what do you look at how do you talk when you're by yourself if you've had a true name change when you are by yourself you will be exactly how you are when you're sitting in here because it's his life in you it's not you anyway you know we we look at the scripture and we hear the the scripture when Jesus when God tells him says it the battle's mine it's not yours let me fight it for you that's the times that we want the name when we're in a battle that's when we want that name to take effect in our life Lord I'm I'm in a battle and that's the only time we ever call out the name that's the only time we get serious about the name is when things are real dire in our life things are real bad and we don't know what to do yes and our character gets seesawed when everything's good we switch back to who we really are we all need a character change we all need the name to take over our character amen but when you re really want to be a Christian Stand Out make it real that's what God wants you to be that'll prove your Works will prove what your character is your character is known by The Works that you do I was telling brother Daryl a while ago when brother brother BR said hear you hear you [Music] him when you become sons of God that's just the start yeah from then on it's your character that's that's what makes the difference it's your character brother brandom also said in the unity of one God in one church when God takes control of your heart he takes control of your character when his name has been placed in you the name has control amen the name has control it's not you anymore why it ain't that you got to fight through it it any it when the name has control you don't have to fight cuz you let him have it all you you you you don't have to fight to pray now the devil Devil's going to he's going to put up a buffer you're not going to get through but it's your desire it's your desire that pushes through what is our character but Raam said in the token your character is God's character if you have taken on that name in identification Bram said the word is the character so is the word born in here is the word birth in here you know so many times our our true character comes out our true character comes out in church this is where shows you where we are really are sometimes like I said earlier you invite him in you pray pray with a prayer request you sit down and you don't he gets no more praise the rest of the service he gets no more praise come on gu no more worship you get upset when somebody shouts around you you don't have the name you can say you do all you don't all you want to you don't have the name if worship upsets you you don't have the name but the deal is is is our character we need God's character brother said the only the what you'll take with you when you leave here is your character if you don't worship him you're not going to worship worship Him in heaven if you don't say Amen here to the word you're not going to say Amen there if you're just a na and a half master that's what you're going to do when you look at Christ on the other side come on that's your character that's what you take how about listen list if you want to use your real character let let's give the the character that you give to your vs to God you shot your shoes off when they hit a p they score a touchdown your hair pins fly everywhere come on come on can you not give that effort to God the one that saved your life what happens when you invite him here and you don't give him the worship you don't give him the praise you done exactly what Simon did in the Bible Simon knew who he was knew his name invited him in told people Jesus is here Jesus is here and left him unw worshiped unpraised [Music] you have the same Spirit of Simon when you don't worship him when you don't praise him oh my you can sit there and get upset Lord but that is the God's honest truth amen if you don't worship him you don't praise him and you have invited him here you have the spirit of Simon we have to become one with the name you know we we we look out how long God wanted greatest desire as we said earlier was was to have Fellowship that was his greatest desire and is and that's why he he spoke let it be let there be light let there be this let because his greatest desire that was his his start to you when the very first thought God had of you he said let there be light because it was in you that he wanted to place his name God didn't come up with with his name later on oh man I need a name now when he thought of his name in the back of his mind was when he thought of you and that's where he wanted to put his name amen God had a plan brother Donnie said the other other day how God had a plan and he had to hide it from Satan so look look at the plan that God started just to put his name in you marriage and divorce brother Brandon made the comment that God allowed Eve to be how she was so she would fall yeah it had to happen yeah so look at the conference brother brandham says in in when she fell and Adam fell by his own choice and he calls him in the garden this may seem like I'm going on a tangent but I'll be back I'm the king of tangents okay so God calls a conference in the garden and when God calls this conference Satan is there too and he tells Satan her seed will bruise your head God didn't put a name on that seed yeah God didn't say there's going to come one and I'm going to call his name Jesus yeah and he's going to and he's going to destroy you he just said her seed so what does Satan do from that point on Satan decides I've got to find that seed and destroy it that was his main mission to destroy that seed he tried to destroy the seed in in Abel you'll never destroy God God has a way of moving that seed around so he tried to destroy that seed in able and then we look just condense this down we we we look at at how God moved that seed and then no doubt Noah he when Noah got on the ark Satan goes I got it narrowed down to eight people actually Four the males I've got this this narrowed down but Noah gets drunk so how can the seed come through Noah yeah see Satan's thing that he looks at you is your imperfections how can you be seed for the things you're doing you'll be flesh till you get out of here you will make a mistake probably one millisecond before the Rapture takes place so don't think when you you have that name consumed in in every being that you are that you're not going to make a mistake God understands this flesh we're not taking it with us so God wanted a name let me back this up and then we'll continue with that in respects he said Mo Moses was scared to go down again Moses was 80 years old now he had been gone 40 years and when he talked to God at the burning bush he said who will I tell them has sent me God had no name God had no name that's right how many thought God had a name in the Old Testament I did I'd never read this till I started studying this God had no name who will I tell them sent me he said the god of your fathers appeared to me they'll say who is the god of your fathers tell them he said you tell them that I am that I am remembering the Lord in 63 Israel had another thing they could always remember then they took their step on what they heard Moses say the great Vindicated Prophet with the word of God when they took their stand to March because they seen God vindicate that message when he was bringing the truth and it was according to the scriptures and God was with him and he had met this one who had no name called I am now I believe God had a name he just never told nobody yeah Mary was the first one he told this is the name right he had met this one who had no name called the I am he had really met him because they had seen him working in Moses so now we know that God is going to move this seed down through his people this was his people this the ones where he wanted to put his name that was his God's desire I want to put my name among you I want to dwell among you I want you to build me this Tabernacle and I want you to do it this way with the labor and the Brazen Altar and all that and and the holiest of holies and Behind These skins I want to dwell there I want to be with you I want to be among you I want to be as closest to you as I can get then we we look at it we move on down to Judah and maybe I I can't sit here and tell you who all satan suspected was was the seed or not I always thought maybe he job was so perfect maybe Satan thought he was the seed but I can't but I can tell you where God took the seed down through the line of Judah and then we Satan look at that and we we we see that Tamar plays a harlot and seduces Judah well that's not like God that can't be God's seed yeah and that seed continues down and comes through a gentile Harlot there's no way God would run a seed through that then he moves it up to to Ruth a moabitas a gentile there's no way on now it comes up through David murder adulter right there's no way and then look at all the evil Kings after David this King did evil in the sight of the Lord this King did evil in the sight of the Lord this King did evil in the side of the Lord and God took his name right through him why he was hiding that seed God wasn't going to hide that seed forever God said man will know my name so he brings the seat on down and there was a time God decided to reveal that seed God's still revealing his seed today lifted him up on high and said look here's Satan right here he is and now I've given him a name God's chosen place of worship but where did he put his name what is his name we'll have to find God's name what God's name is before we find where he's putting it in the place now we find out that he had many titles he is called Father which is a title he was called son which is a title he was called Holy Ghost which is a title he was called Rose of Sharon which is the title lily of the valley Morning Star Jehovah Gyra Jehovah RFA seven different compound Redemptive names all of them were titles none of them were names but he has a name and we find out that Jesus said also I came in my father's name and you receed me not then the name of the father must be Jesus all right the name of the father is Jesus because Jesus said so I'll carry my father's name I come in my father's name you receive me not that his name was Jesus Gabriel called him Jesus the prophets called him Jesus he was absolutely Jesus before his birth even the holy prophet called him Emmanuel which is God With Us and God was manifested in flesh in order to take away the sin of the world and doing so he was given the name of Jesus God was given the name Jesus amen amen the name was placed in a man not a church not a denomination not a Creed but a man he chose to place his name in Jesus Christ now we find out that when he becomes the place of God worship where you worship him so if you worship Him in spirit and Truth like the prophet just said you worship him that means you have the name here that's the only way you can worship him where God placed his name so Gabriel comes to marry she's not married yet and tells her you're going to you're going to receive a child you got to understand God created the egg God created the cell and he moved his life into them he joined them together there was a union of the egg and the sail and then God puts his own life in that you talking about a mighty God when we think how big and how great God is that you you know you see pictures of him holding his hand the world on this big huge God but yet he made himself so small that he put his life into a sale for 9 months and then Mary birthed God some people think he wasn't God until he got baptized in the dev came down the Holy Spirit came upon him I got a quote where brother brandom said God was born in Bethlehem so God allmighty God the Creator is born a baby and then she holds Mary holds this little baby looks into the eyes of God and calls him Jesus she's holding God she's holding the word she's looking into the eyes of the word amen and calls him the name that was given to him God's name but brandom said in conference with God God dwells in humility not in p that's always been the devil's idea God comes in humility that'll be a sign not a Lesser God but a man he cried like a baby when he was a baby he played in the streets like a boy when he was a boy he worked in the carpenter shop with Joseph as a man at work he eat when he was hungry he sweated when he was hot he cried when he was sorrowful he was a man this will be a sign to you God will dwell with you in a humble not a great big uppity man but a little low man with no background be careful of a man that wants to tell you how much and everything he's done I've done this I've done that God don't dwell in that God dwells in humility let me tell you what God has done amen let me tell you the works that God's done God's God's not here to to put you on a billboard we're here to put him on a billboard that's the stroke of the devil right there when a death stroke to every denomination and pomp all Pomp and Glory of this world is a Deathstroke that the god of Heaven chose to came come that way that's what happened at the conference it had to be decided that's the way he chose to come he didn't have to come that way he was the god of heaven but he chose to come as a baby he chose to come that way that's what happened at the conference in heaven so we see that he comes down this this Lamb of God this is the one that's going to take away the sin of the world and John tells him when he comes down the river Behold the Lamb that takes away the sin of the world John saying this is the one that's going to bruise the Serpent's head this is him do you realize who John was I wonder if John ever realized when he seen Jesus walking down that he looked at Jesus and said this is the one that raised me from the dead when I was in my mom's womb amen yes sir the mention of that name that's the power of the name the mention of that name gave John Life John was dead in the womb of Elizabeth and that spoken word with Mary speaks the name of God she didn't speak just an everyday given name of her neighbor or something she spoke the name of God and when she spoke the name of God life came into a dead baby then the baby that received life is now about to baptize him the one that's going to bruise the Serpent's head yeah so this is the one that's going to take away the sin of the world this is my son the one that pleases me and it now after he goes on we know he's lifted up he shows Satan God shows Satan this is him the own people where he wanted to put his name have crucified him yeah that brings us back to Malachi 1 in the Gentiles I will place my name I wanted to give my name to you I tried and I tried and I tried I knocked and I knocked and I knocked I wanted to give you my name you wouldn't open Jesus goes over over Jerusalem and weeps over Jerusalem yeah I wanted you to have my name I wanted you to walk down the aisle with me and I would give it to you yes sir but you wouldn't have it you realize the love that God has do we ever fathom how much God loves us we we read the scriptures we read the scriptures and we look at how the Bible says that that God would that all men would be saved oh man that's who God wanted to give his name to everybody this is what I want to do the whole world all of God's creation and God says I would love if everybody would take it on now but they would not he loved he brother brand said he loved Cain he he he tried to give Cain way out he loved him Jesus walks up to the Rich Young Ruler this is God Almighty who knows all things walking up to a man he already knows is going to hell he knows he's going to hell right and he said he looked upon and loved him and still offered him come follow me you're going to hell but I'm offering you way out of it do we understand God's love the Satan's going to make sure you don't yeah you remind he tries to remind you of all the bad you've done all the bad things in your life he tries to remind you and you totally forget his name the name that was given so that you might have deliverance and that clouds you look at your transgressions and things in your life and it and it clouds your memory all you can think about is all that you've done you think all the sins that you've done you totally cannot you can't even pray you can't even ask the one that gave you the name Lord for give me listen people if you don't know who you are don't leave here until you figure out Lord give me a full revelation of who I am because I'm going to tell you who you are you are him you are him amen so when Satan comes to you and tells you everything you've done he's accusing God if you've received the full baptism of the Holy Spirit his life is in you he became you so you could become him right and you let Satan accuse God of things you've done that you've already repented of that you put into hell please remember who you are don't leave here today until you know for sure who you are amen how do you get the name how do you get that name there has to be a union there has to be a union when a groom a boy and a girl they date for a while they get to know one another if she loves him enough she'll want his name she'll want to take on his name if he loves her enough he'll want to give it that's how Union happens when it's a mutual desire I want your name and you want to give it that's the only way a true Union with God works was you when you want his name and he truly wants to give it that's when you get the power of the name that's when both your names go on the check that's when that check doesn't require two signatures just one when there's a marriage and now we have mutual property that's the way to step if you didn't know as s state of Tennessee looks if you're married Mutual property so ladies you want to sell his motorcycle you got the right or his dog or his guns or whatever so we've been looking at recently we've been looking at brother Donnie's been preaching so much on Boaz and Ruth when you look at that we look we look at the conference there at the gate the meeting at the gate when Boaz is sitting there with to and the other other men of the city and he comes to to and says are you going to [Music] redeem all that was meons all to could thinking of was property possessions that's what to wanted property and possessions all Boaz wanted was to give Ruth his name right that's all he wanted all satan wants from you is possessions he could never pay the price to couldn't pay this price Devil Couldn't pay the price why his name is not Eternal Satan's name is not Eternal he couldn't give you an eternal name and that's the price that had to be paid a price that would be paid so that God could put upon you a name that was eternal Bo Boaz says I can pay that I can give her a name good what Satan wants from you he wants your healing he wants your salvation he wants your Redemption he wants your joy your peace everything that God's given you that's the property he wants Satan is your to he can't give you a name he can't give you a name why as soon as he marries you he's going to put you away amen and his name is not Eternal there is no power in his name that's why to couldn't pay this price he wasn't willing to give her a name but that's what Boaz says that's all I want to give is my name why cuz look what came with boaz's name everything Boaz had he didn't want anything Ruth had God don't want anything you got he don't need your help God don't need your helpen so when you you come into this marriage with God and you're thinking well God I'm I'm I'm pretty good at this I can do this I can do that God says I don't want any of it the best thing you can give God is nothing the best thing you can is accept his name because when you've accept the name everything you do from there on out is him amen and now you own everything he has but there was a price that had to be paid and Bo says I paid that price Jesus had to pay a price for you it looked like the price wasn't going to get paid when you read the scripture there in John when John looked over Heaven John says I looked over Heaven and Earth no one was worthy no one was worthy to take the book brother brandom said that that that John looked in that book and saw his name his name was on the book of redemption but there was nobody there to take the book nobody to redeem his name yeah no one could take it and brother brand says whenever I think it was in the breach he said when John looked he didn't see the lamb cuz the lamb wasn't there yet and then a voice behind him said John Behold the Lamb that taketh way the sin of the world Behold the Lamb brother BR said he wasn't there yet he had come out through the throne he said John hadn't mentioned it because the lamb had gone back into the eternities why did he go back God still loved them people God still had to redeem those sacrifices that were done by bulls and goats all the sacrifices that job had made there was no Eternal price paid for those yet all the sacrifices that David that Solomon Elijah all those had made Abraham from from beginning from from Adam all the way up those sacrific says had to have an eternal blood put upon them they had to have an eternal name put upon them and John looks and says there's no one worthy who's going to take the book there's there's no one here and and we we look at that and John saw your name John saw my name but John was in despair because we were lost no one was there to take the book the breach John hadn't noticed the lamb before it hadn't been mentioned before nor had it been mentioned John didn't see it all over Heavens he was looking said but here it came forth where did it come from it came from the father's Throne where he had been seated since he had been slain and risen again he raised up and sat on the right hand of God ever living to make intercessions skip down John looked at that lamb and the lamb looked like he had been slain then he noticed he was wounded and cut and bruised and bleeding a bloody lamb that's what took our place isn't it strange a simple lamb had to take our place he saw the lamb he proceeded out John hadn't saw him because he had been way back into the eternities making intercession showing that those who had come up to God under the offering of bulls of goats substitutionary offering cuz them who believed it pointed to him the blood hadn't been shed yet he was there to clear it and he was there to clear you and I would you've been given that name you know when when he took your name and put your name on that book I believe brother brother Donnie said here a few months ago when he wrote his name on that book he had to write yours cuz you share the same name you share when he looks at his name in the book he sees yours why because he gave you his name look at the prodical son I'm going to try to Skip Along here I'm going too long I told them fix that clock the other day they ain't done it look at the prodical son prodical son is in this hog pin right with a name he has the father's name if the prodical son never realized who he was he would have never got that's right if he had never thought you about his father he'd have never got up he'd have laid there in that filthy mess that he was laying in he would have stayed there he would have continued to eat what the hogs eat because he wouldn't have known who he was if you're a true seat of God I don't care where you're at in your life if you're at a place that you're not supposed to be you know it because you know who your father is you know what name you have if you don't have that name there's people that will go through entire life lost nothing they're not predestinated they was they will die in the hog pin yes sir but when you've been given an eternal name you might be in the hog pin right now but all that has been given to him will come to him at some point and it might be a long dusty road you might be laying in a hog pin right now but when you get a revelation a true revelation of who you are you will head back home it's like I said told somebody the other day I believe we are in the age of the prodal you start seeing people coming back now that that have been gone for years people coming back and giving their heart to God he says I have them all in my hand I haven't lost in one they might be backslid for 40 years and then come give their heart to God I believe you're going to see it happen more and more where the short we we're at the endend time and now you've got people recognizing who their father is this is not where I belong but you understand when that prodal come down running down the road and the father seen him a far off you think that the father just seen a man running down the road to him he saw his name I gave him that name he belongs to me that's what sent the father running after him if that was one of his son's friends that didn't bear the name if you if you if you look in strong concordance when it talks how the the father ran the word ran was to run out of fervent Peril to run out out of of desperation that's when the how the father God comes after you that way am amen God runs after you he don't just Mosey up to you and say hey you going to ever come back that's not way God works look at yourself as a father if your son or daughter was backslid would you just tell your wife once in a while man I sure hope they come back to church be on your knees day and night praying to God God bring them back why because it's the name that they're given and then we have the prodical brother self yeah had the father's name right yeah but look what all I've done look what I've done for you God I've done this and then he starts pointing out his brother's transgressions don't have the spirit of the prodical brother telling everybody did you see what so- and so did did you hear about so and so you're the prodical brother oh my you're self-righteous you are the prodical brother you bear the name but you just don't have a full revelation of it yet amen that's a free one but we understand Fathers and Sons there just something about Fathers and Sons and desires that fathers have for their sons I was watching a video uh I read I saw a clip on it and I was reading an article on it too some of y'all know who Tom ISO is Right Michigan State basketball coach I like sports some of y'all think maybe that's carnal well worryed about my businesses too so so so Tom ISO had an adopted son named Stephen sat on the bench in Michigan State for five years out of five years Steven ISO played approximately 56 minutes of basketball in 5 years wow adopted son 56 minutes never scored a point until third to the last game of his fifth year and that was kind of by accident threw a shot up bounced around and one in that place erupted Place went crazy they interviewed Tom ISO after that this man has had many guys that sit on his bench year after year after year never play never get to get in but when they interviewed him he was just crying just crying he said I could die right now a happy man yeah my son scored one basket a happy man and they said well why he said because he made 15,000 people happy 15,000 people happy I know what that feels like I know I brag a lot of my kids but when he's not here so I can say it when Michael kicked the field go Hampton hey you made a thousand people happy and a thousand people mad but I could have said Lord take me now that's my boy why did he feel that way why do you feel that way when your son does something it's the name that they bear it's the name you think when you overcome one little besetting sin that heaven is just sitting around giving you a little golf clap have rups you make all of eternity Rejoice you make God shout all over Heaven why when you score a point against the devil why because you bear his name you have his name across your back amen we figure out we can look at the analogies all we want let's say we're in a game you might not get off the bench in five years but when God put you in and he's going to put you in yeah you might only have get one shot you might get one but God says this one was made for you that's good thank you Lord you realize that testimony I'm me tell you something if you're a person that's sitting here today and you're filled with the Holy Ghost and you let God take care of your life you live your life and let God lead you guide you the people that you work with the people that you know that you see around they know who you are you are leaving a testimony and it's not you it's because of his name I'm was reluctant to tell this cuz I sometimes people think you're boasting when you say stuff but God knows my heart I'm not I walked outside in my building the other day and there's a guy there he's a captain with Sheriff's Department I've known him for 26 years he's worked for four different departments around the country and we're talking and I don't have no idea what brought it up he said Jo let me tell you something he said do you realize that you have a name that nobody in this country around here could he said you're known for it they can't put finger on your life I'm want to be so much I said buddy a you me I don't know what to say but I pray that it wasn't me they were looking at yeah if if me trying to live this life and Lord knows and I started thinking and this devil got me thinking started thinking about man I hope they don't find out about this hope they don't find out about that but I thought Lord You're so gracious that you let people see you and me you you let them see you and me it ain't me quit looking at your own abilities things you think you're awesome at things you think you could do and you want everybody to know how good you are at what you do if there's any good in you it's of God amen any good in you there's not one Speck of good in human being brother brandom said without the Holy Ghost you would just be a beast a brute but he desired he looked at this Beast this brute and said I desire to put my name in there I'm so glad he did Brother ARL where would we be let's stand together brother brandom said in thirst now remember if you've got eternal life your life was in God at the beginning and the life God is the word and when the word was made flesh in Jesus Christ God came to dwell in his own body God came to dwell in his own body it's kind of sounds like a paradox to me try to dwell in your own body God tried to dwell God coming down to dwell in his own body and made himself the Son of God when God came down to dwell in that you were in him when you were crucified you were crucified with him and you died with him on Calvary you were buried with him on the and on the mountain and you Rose with him on Easter morning now you're sitting together in Heavenly places in him and now you've got fellowship with him when he puts his name in you you now have fellowship with him you know I got to think when I was when I was when I was studying this and and read that quote where brother brandom said I died with him I was crucified with him I died with him and I rose with him and I got to thinking about that well if I was crucified with him and if if I died with him and I was buried with him then I went to hell with him I kicked in the door with him I took the keys with him and you took away every every Power that Satan had when Satan opened that door when Christ kicked that door in Satan looks outside and sees he who has the name right he saw you [Applause] right he didn't see just Jesus standing there he saw every one that he gave that name to you took the keys from him you conquered death hell and the grave because he did you realize everything that God has done when he put his name in you he attributes that to you every great work God ever done because he became you so you could become him so everything that he done he attributes to you preach wow there's so much that we don't think about yes there's so much that I think it has to be a revelation it has to be a revelation you can't just come in here and preacher say God put his name in you God's name is in you and you say okay let's I'll go live that it comes a a re Supernatural Revelation from heaven for you to realize who you are because if we if it came if it came by just knowledge we'd already be gone yeah Rapture would already take place it takes Revelation when the bride realizes who she is by Supernatural Revelation yes it's not by somebody telling you right we're we're almost there we're at the door you know I I was thinking this if if Mary received that seed from God and that produced God himself what is it going to do to you and I we receive God's name we receive God in us it'll produce the same thing it did with Mary amen you be able to hold God look in his eyes and call his name that's true that's my God the god that doesn't put himself so way up here brother brandom said before the foundation of the world he wasn't even God there was no one there to worship him but God never intended to remain an object of worship he wanted to be a groom he wanted to be a father he wanted to be a son and he wanted to live in you let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord how great you are how wonderful that you are Lord that you would take a a lowly human being full of mistakes full of failures Lord if your Prophet would say that he was so full of mistakes and failures what about us but you looked upon this pile of mistakes this pile of failures and your greatest desire was to put your name in me put your name in every one of these standing here this morning Father Lord I hope that's a revelation that becomes so true in every one of our Lives Lord I pray that you would touch every heart here Lord if it's not become a revelation of who they really are father I pray that you would Open the Eyes of their heart their eyes of understanding father and Lord may that be their greatest desire is to know who they really
