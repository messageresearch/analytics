[45:27] grateful Lord what a great thing life is

[45:42] nation so the statistics say one baby
[45:47] every 24
[45:49] seconds is
[45:51] aborted but this brother and sister
[45:54] desired to bring a child child into the
[45:56] Earth to be able to teach it train it to
[46:01] be able to take it with them when they
[46:03] go to heaven Lord God they bring it now
[46:07] back to you asking you father that you'd
[46:10] take his little
[46:12] life if little Hudson would get old
[46:14] enough to be able to make his choice may
[46:18] his choice be soon while his heart is
[46:21] tender father I pray for my sister being
[46:24] the Fifth Gospel that ual helper to be
[46:27] able to let him see Jesus and Mama and
[46:30] my brother let him see Jesus and daddy
[46:34] keep him from the evils of the day
[46:37] sicknesses diseases things that are so
[46:39] rampant in this hour we dedicate his
[46:42] little life to you father for a life of
[46:45] service in the name of
[46:47] Jesus
[46:51] amen yeah he knows how to do that don't
[46:54] he
[47:00] ni praise the
[47:03] Lord let's stand
[47:12] together let's turn tonight if you would
[47:14] to First Peter chapter 1 verse
[47:17] 10 I'm he happy to be in the house of
[47:19] the
[47:20] Lord privilege for us is it to be able
[47:23] to come together to serve God to be able
[47:26] to live for him in this day of such
[47:29] Darkness such terrible terrible time
[47:33] that's around the world and yet God by
[47:35] his Mercy has called us to himself we're
[47:38] so grateful for that I want to speak to
[47:41] you again tonight on what is the Holy
[47:43] Ghost we'll read the scriptures that we
[47:45] read last Wednesday night from here in
[47:48] Peter of which salvation the prophets
[47:51] have inquired and searched
[47:54] diligently who prophesied side of the
[47:57] grace that should come unto you I want
[48:02] you notice what they did now they
[48:04] prophesied of the grace which should
[48:07] come unto you so what is
[48:10] prophecy prophecy is telling something
[48:14] in the future a future event by divine
[48:20] inspiration most of the times the
[48:22] prophets of the Old Testament were
[48:24] saying things it was not even written in
[48:27] the Bible it became written after they
[48:30] spoke it that's what prophecy actually
[48:33] is so who prophesied of the grace that
[48:36] should come unto you searching what or
[48:40] what manner of time the spirit of Christ
[48:44] which was in them did signify so they
[48:48] were looking searching trying to
[48:52] understand when will it be we know it's
[48:54] coming we know it's coming it's the word
[48:56] of the Lord when is it but they couldn't
[48:58] understand the time frame when it
[49:01] testified beforehand the sufferings of
[49:05] Christ and the glory that should follow
[49:09] unto whom it was revealed that not unto
[49:14] themselves but unto us they did Minister
[49:18] the things which are now reported unto
[49:21] you by them that have preached the
[49:23] gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent
[49:28] down from heaven which things the Angels
[49:34] desire to look into let's read the
[49:38] meaning of the word again look to stoop
[49:42] to a thing in order to look at so you're
[49:46] stooping so the angels of God looking
[49:50] and peering into this to look at with
[49:54] head bowed for forward to look into with
[49:57] the body bent to stoop and look into
[50:02] metaphorically to look carefully into
[50:06] inspect
[50:08] curiously of one who would become
[50:12] acquainted with something Angels which
[50:15] would become acquainted with your walk
[50:18] with God your experience God's grace to
[50:21] you and it's so profound to them that
[50:25] they just bend over and look at it
[50:28] trying to understand it and we let the
[50:31] devil beat the Daylights out of us
[50:32] trying to tell us we ain't got nothing I
[50:35] wonder if the angels of God could pass
[50:37] through this place tonight and scream
[50:40] and holler to the top of their voice and
[50:43] say do you all know what you
[50:45] have do you realize what you have and
[50:49] they study us and look at us and stoop
[50:54] over to try to understand may God help
[50:57] us
[50:59] tonight and may can raise your hands
[51:01] Lord I need my eyes open in a greater
[51:04] way amen me too let's bow our heads
[51:07] together we'll pray over this prayer
[51:09] Closs tonight for brother Bernie young
[51:12] is having surgery this week we want to
[51:13] just pray for our brother everything
[51:15] will will go
[51:17] well father as we bow our
[51:21] heads not to peer or to look into
[51:24] something
[51:26] but Lord God to the dust of the Earth
[51:28] from once our bodies were
[51:30] taken with Thanksgiving in our
[51:33] heart that we hold within our souls
[51:35] tonight a
[51:38] possession of such great value that the
[51:41] Holy Angels of God look into it and
[51:44] would desire to understand it
[51:47] Greater we come before you tonight
[51:50] father asking you that you'd be mindful
[51:51] of all the needs of your children the
[51:53] sick the weary The Afflicted
[51:55] those that need a touch in their home
[51:58] maybe in their finances whatever it is
[52:00] Father Lord for this prayer clause and I
[52:03] going to preach with tonight I pray that
[52:05] you'd be mindful of brother Bernie Lord
[52:07] may this surgery go well be no evil
[52:09] report that'll come of it father we
[52:11] commit ourselves to you tonight we ask
[52:13] you that you'd come and anoint not only
[52:15] the speaker but anoint the hearers that
[52:18] we can be benefited by gathering
[52:20] together tonight father in the name of
[52:22] the Lord Jesus we ask it and Saints said
[52:26] am God bless you you may be seated
[52:36] tonight Thursday night whenever I did
[52:39] the question answers with the youth and
[52:40] I'm sure they've already announced it
[52:41] we'll be having another one again
[52:42] tomorrow night Lord willing but I went
[52:45] this way these few scriptures that we're
[52:48] going to look at for just a few moments
[52:50] on uh the spirit of Truth what the Holy
[52:53] Ghost um really is and we know that John
[52:57] set it forth that there was a spirit of
[52:59] Truth and there was a spirit of error
[53:02] and many people think because they get
[53:06] truth they might pack a Bible they might
[53:08] read the Bible they believe it
[53:10] intellectually some of the message
[53:12] people they think because they listen to
[53:14] tapes and they read the books and they
[53:16] have a a fairly good knowledge and
[53:18] understanding of the message and they
[53:20] think well I I I believe the message so
[53:22] that means I've got the Holy Ghost but
[53:24] yet we know that we could have a portion
[53:26] of truth and not have the spirit of
[53:29] Truth Now Jesus divides the spirit of
[53:33] truth from truth so if he divided the
[53:36] spirit of truth from truth then that
[53:39] helps me to see that John puts it in in
[53:42] two categories that there's a spirit of
[53:44] Truth and there's a spirit of error so
[53:47] there's also truth and error and most of
[53:50] us probably are sitting here tonight
[53:52] there's things that we believe that may
[53:54] actually makes it be wrong and we
[53:57] believe it because we don't know any
[54:00] better but if someone shows us in the
[54:03] scripture or in the message that we're
[54:05] believing something wrong if we're a
[54:07] real child of God and we have the spirit
[54:09] of Truth in us then that error can be
[54:13] corrected because we have the spirit of
[54:15] Truth or you saying now now now brother
[54:17] Donnie if you'll show people that it's
[54:19] the truth they'll be corrected no I'll
[54:22] tell you they won't because I've showed
[54:25] many people down through my years in the
[54:28] ministry of things they were wrong in
[54:30] things they were believing wrong things
[54:33] they were doing wrong and show them over
[54:36] and over and over again and they still
[54:39] would not accept it even though they
[54:42] said they believed the truth so you
[54:45] think how could that be because there's
[54:47] a difference in the spirit of truth and
[54:50] truth and there's a difference in error
[54:53] and the spirit of error now if a person
[54:56] is actually under the spirit of error
[54:58] you can show them the truths page after
[55:01] page quote after quote scripture after
[55:02] scripture whatever it is and if they're
[55:05] under the spirit of error they will
[55:08] process that truth under that anointing
[55:12] of that spirit and it will explain it to
[55:15] them and they will in turn explain it
[55:18] away or make an excuse why they can't do
[55:21] it now that's a person operating under
[55:24] the spirit of ER so they hear truths
[55:27] truths truths more truths and the truths
[55:30] actually doesn't make them free because
[55:33] they're under the spirit of error so the
[55:35] Holy Ghost this is one thing that he's
[55:38] going to be he's a comforter he's a seal
[55:41] he's peace he's Joy he's all of these
[55:44] things but Jesus wants us to know now
[55:47] listen carefully what he says here in St
[55:50] John 14:1 16 I will pray the father and
[55:53] he shall give you another comforter that
[55:56] he may abide with you forever even the
[55:59] spirit of Truth Now notice he doesn't
[56:02] say even the truth but the spirit of
[56:07] Truth now this is why people can embrace
[56:10] the truth for a while sometimes people
[56:13] will come to the truth you know for many
[56:15] many years and then all of a sudden they
[56:18] fall away and you saying how in the
[56:19] world could that have happened because
[56:21] the truth was up here and never down
[56:24] here by
[56:25] Revelation so not only did they miss a
[56:29] revelation of understanding the
[56:31] furtherance of that truth but they miss
[56:34] the spirit of truth because the spirit
[56:37] of Truth abiding in us will never allow
[56:41] us to remain in error no absolutely
[56:45] impossible now you may be as I said
[56:47] sitting here tonight believing something
[56:49] wrong but God will make sure that he
[56:52] straightens us out before we leave this
[56:54] world world because the Holy Ghost in us
[56:57] will lead and guide us
[57:00] into a all truths so it's not enough
[57:03] just to believe in one God it's not
[57:05] enough just to have well I've got a
[57:07] great portion of Truth the Holy Ghost
[57:09] will lead us into all the truths of the
[57:12] age that we live in now notice Jesus
[57:15] says even the spirit of Truth whom the
[57:18] world cannot receive now once again this
[57:21] proves that a person that's a sinner
[57:24] coming here tonight and we might make an
[57:26] altar call and they may bow here on
[57:28] their knees and say Lord Jesus uh
[57:31] receive me I ask you to forgive me of my
[57:33] sins that person cannot receive the Holy
[57:37] Ghost they receive the spirit of God in
[57:41] the form of justification by Fai now
[57:44] remember God's typing it through the
[57:46] church ages so lucer had a portion of
[57:49] the spirit of God Wesley had a portion
[57:52] Pentecost had a greater portion we by
[57:55] God's grace have a greater portion than
[57:58] them is that right so whenever a person
[58:00] then comes to the Lord they are just
[58:03] repenting of their sins but they're
[58:05] still not a candidate to be able to
[58:07] receive the fullness of the spirit of
[58:09] God they may still smoke they may drink
[58:12] they may have filthy habits you know
[58:14] what they've got to do they've got to be
[58:16] Sanctified before the Holy Ghost will
[58:18] ever come and seal their soul is that
[58:20] right now notice Jesus said even the
[58:23] spirit of truth of whom the world cannot
[58:25] receive because it seeth him not neither
[58:30] knoweth him well that's a sad thing
[58:32] about it today as well because they
[58:34] don't know him they don't know him in
[58:36] the attribute of receiving him as the
[58:39] Holy Ghost because many of the churches
[58:41] teach them today once they receive
[58:44] Christ as their savior they're born
[58:46] again they got eternal life they got
[58:48] everything they need that's a
[58:51] lie I said that's a lie you're not truly
[58:54] converted Ed until you receive the Holy
[58:57] Ghost you're Justified Sanctified then
[59:00] you receive the baptism of the Holy
[59:02] Ghost which seals your soul until the
[59:04] day of redemption now notice he says for
[59:08] he said but ye know him for he dwelleth
[59:11] with you Lord have mercy what's Jesus
[59:13] saying you know him for he dwelleth with
[59:17] you notice he doesn't say in you now
[59:20] who's he talking about himself so who's
[59:23] it going to be him himself and another
[59:26] attribute of the godhead which can be
[59:29] divided Jesus in sunship form could not
[59:33] have been divided to come back on the
[59:36] day of Pentecost but Jesus in the form
[59:39] of the Son of God not son of man
[59:42] remember he identified himself as son of
[59:45] man which was a prophet to Israel but he
[59:48] further identifies himself in the church
[59:50] ages as Son of God what is God a spirit
[59:54] what is is the Son of God baptism of the
[59:57] Holy Ghost the divisive part of God
[1:00:00] which can be divided into many many many
[1:00:04] parts of the spirit of God living in
[1:00:06] human hearts around the world now Jesus
[1:00:09] said they don't know him but you all
[1:00:11] know him you imagine them looking around
[1:00:13] one another and said we don't know him
[1:00:14] he said yes you do you do know him
[1:00:17] because he's dwelling with
[1:00:19] you you never imagine they didn't have
[1:00:22] the Holy Ghost so they're trying to
[1:00:23] figure out what in the world is he
[1:00:24] talking about notice he goes on to say I
[1:00:29] will not leave you
[1:00:31] comfortless now it would seem as if
[1:00:33] though in verse 17 that Jesus is
[1:00:36] speaking about the father giving another
[1:00:39] being separate from himself but then he
[1:00:43] goes down in verse 18 and lets them know
[1:00:45] hey boys it's me in another
[1:00:49] form it ain't another God it ain't the
[1:00:52] third person of the godhead it's me in a
[1:00:56] changed condescended form oh don't you
[1:01:00] love the truth of God's word I will not
[1:01:02] leave you comfortless I will come to you
[1:01:08] oh I'm so glad that he has aren't you St
[1:01:10] John
[1:01:11] 15:26 but when the comforter is come now
[1:01:15] notice again how he says this whom I
[1:01:18] will
[1:01:20] send unto you from the father now you IM
[1:01:24] their s there shaking their head said a
[1:01:26] while ago he said the father is going to
[1:01:28] send it and then he said it was him now
[1:01:31] he's sing like he sending it from the
[1:01:33] father who in the world is all this they
[1:01:36] really needed the Holy Ghost to
[1:01:38] understand this didn't they whom I will
[1:01:40] send unto you from the father even the
[1:01:43] spirit of
[1:01:45] Truth Now please don't misunderstand me
[1:01:48] it's easier to get the truth than it is
[1:01:52] the spirit yes sir of Tru truth somebody
[1:01:56] can drop a book on your door somebody
[1:01:58] could leave a Bible The Gideons do it
[1:02:00] all the time they could leave a a Bible
[1:02:03] in a hotel room and you could be sitting
[1:02:06] there one night and you're all sad and
[1:02:07] Lon and depressed and you pick up that
[1:02:09] bible and you read maybe John 3:16 you
[1:02:12] know somewhere where it talks about
[1:02:13] salvation and you receive the truth and
[1:02:16] you say God I'm so sorry please forgive
[1:02:19] me and you receive that truth it does
[1:02:21] not mean that you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:02:24] which is the spirit of Truth when you
[1:02:27] repented you receive that portion of the
[1:02:30] spirit of God which John 316 would allow
[1:02:34] you to have but there's more to that now
[1:02:38] watch he said when the comforters come
[1:02:40] whom I will send unto you from the
[1:02:42] father even the spirit of Truth which
[1:02:45] proceedeth from the father he shall
[1:02:48] testify of me St John 16:12 I have yet
[1:02:53] many things to say unto you but you
[1:02:56] cannot bear them how be it when he the
[1:03:00] spirit of Truth is
[1:03:02] come listen what he's going to do he
[1:03:05] will guide you into just a little bit of
[1:03:10] Truth and then once you get that little
[1:03:13] bit of Truth you never have to read your
[1:03:14] Bible again and you'll never have to
[1:03:17] study no more and that's all you'll ever
[1:03:20] get well that's what people believe
[1:03:22] that's what they think they can do and
[1:03:24] they spend more time you know reading
[1:03:27] this magazine or that magazine or doing
[1:03:29] this and that and the other than they do
[1:03:31] trying to find the way of Salvation
[1:03:33] because they think once they get saved
[1:03:35] they know it all right there well I hate
[1:03:37] to be the one to bust your balloon
[1:03:38] tonight but you just barely got
[1:03:42] started how's been saved here for many
[1:03:44] many years and you could say sometimes I
[1:03:46] feel like I just got started
[1:03:48] myself now watch he said how be it when
[1:03:51] he the spirit of Truth has come he will
[1:03:53] guide you in into all Truth for he shall
[1:03:55] not speak of himself but whatsoever he
[1:03:59] shall hear that shall he speak and he
[1:04:03] will show you things to come now what
[1:04:06] will the Holy Ghost do in me and you
[1:04:12] what will the Holy Ghost do now this
[1:04:15] comes back to the first question that I
[1:04:17] answered the other night about how will
[1:04:19] I know I've got the Holy Ghost well this
[1:04:21] is some of the things that the Holy
[1:04:23] Ghost will do do in us he will guide us
[1:04:26] into all truth he will Comfort us he
[1:04:30] will show us things to come why because
[1:04:36] the holy spirit is the very access into
[1:04:40] future events and he will show you
[1:04:44] things to come 1 John 4: 6 we are of God
[1:04:48] he that knoweth God heareth us he that
[1:04:50] is not of God heareth us not hereby know
[1:04:53] we the spirit of truth and the spirit of
[1:04:58] error so there is truth and there is
[1:05:01] error there is Spirit of Truth and
[1:05:04] spirit of error I don't mind telling you
[1:05:06] there's been times in my life that I
[1:05:09] have not only believed error but I was
[1:05:12] under the spirit of error whenever I was
[1:05:16] a trinitarian there was people that
[1:05:18] tried to talk to me and show me things
[1:05:20] in the Bible about one God and water
[1:05:23] baptism it didn't make no difference how
[1:05:26] many scripture they showed me it didn't
[1:05:28] move me at all I'm not saying that
[1:05:31] tonight to be proud of it I say that
[1:05:33] because it's a shame because I was under
[1:05:37] a spirit of error anybody else in the
[1:05:40] building honest enough tonight to say
[1:05:42] you've been under the spirit of error
[1:05:44] too and people would show you truth and
[1:05:46] you'd look right at it and read it from
[1:05:48] the Bible and you still wouldn't receive
[1:05:50] it but is't it wonderful you receive it
[1:05:53] tonight why
[1:05:54] God was able to remove that Spirit off
[1:05:58] of you and then the very things that you
[1:06:01] read before that you didn't see and
[1:06:03] understand it's like all of a sudden
[1:06:05] your eyes just came open now what
[1:06:08] happened it what what it was more truth
[1:06:11] no it was not so much necessarily that
[1:06:13] it was more truth sometimes it's the
[1:06:16] exact same amount of truth that was
[1:06:19] shown to you before but the spirit of
[1:06:22] error was driven away from you now let
[1:06:25] me say this to you that we can be under
[1:06:28] the spirit of error about lots of things
[1:06:32] it's not just doctrinally we can get in
[1:06:35] our mind that someone doesn't like us
[1:06:39] and what is that many times it's a
[1:06:40] spirit of error we can get in our mind
[1:06:43] that when the preacher's preaching he's
[1:06:45] looking right at me oh my goodness and I
[1:06:48] I just know he's just preaching that for
[1:06:50] me only somebody's been talking to
[1:06:52] brother Donnie and you know what a
[1:06:54] person can get under that Spirit of
[1:06:56] error and they'll be totally convinced I
[1:06:58] could sit and talk to them and tell them
[1:07:01] brother sister I'm not out against you I
[1:07:03] ain't got nothing against you but until
[1:07:06] they would let God deliver them of that
[1:07:08] Spirit of error they won't believe me a
[1:07:10] bit more than nothing or you or anyone
[1:07:13] else so the spirit of error is quite a
[1:07:16] broad spectrum it would probably scare
[1:07:19] most of us if we knew how many times we
[1:07:22] have been under Spirit of PR what do you
[1:07:24] mean Brother D well error is a falsehood
[1:07:27] so it's something that you disbelieve
[1:07:30] about God's word it can also be
[1:07:32] something that you disbelieve about one
[1:07:34] of God's children or one of God's men
[1:07:37] and it's so real to you yet in reality
[1:07:40] it cannot be proven that this man of God
[1:07:43] done that or was out to get you but
[1:07:45] you're totally convinced now what what
[1:07:47] the spirit of God in us will do are we
[1:07:50] still subject to being in error and
[1:07:53] making making mistakes actually we get
[1:07:55] the Holy Ghost yes we are that's part of
[1:07:58] our growth that's part of our maturity
[1:08:00] in the Lord Jesus and our Humanity will
[1:08:02] bother us as long as we're here but the
[1:08:04] more submitted we get to him and the
[1:08:06] more we surrender than to me I I believe
[1:08:09] in Repentance I thank God for his blood
[1:08:11] don't you I thank God for his Mercy that
[1:08:14] I can go but when I look at the Covenant
[1:08:16] of God if the mercy of God is there to
[1:08:18] forgive me whenever I do wrong cannot
[1:08:21] the wisdom and the strength of God in
[1:08:23] the Holy Ghost cannot he and I become
[1:08:26] closer and closer and that he can
[1:08:29] actually stop me from doing wrong cannot
[1:08:32] the spirit of God in Me lead me away
[1:08:36] from a trap if the Holy Ghost knows that
[1:08:39] the devil's got a trap laid for me
[1:08:41] cannot the Holy Ghost say go around that
[1:08:44] bypass that amen cannot the spirit of
[1:08:48] God how many knows he's done that for
[1:08:49] you and your life well if the Holy Ghost
[1:08:52] in us can lead us into all truths and
[1:08:55] and can be able to show us things that
[1:08:56] are going to come can he show us a
[1:08:59] pitfalls cannot he show us a mistakes in
[1:09:01] our life am I preaching to you that
[1:09:03] you'll never make another one no but
[1:09:05] I'll tell you one thing I'd be a mighty
[1:09:08] happy Pastor if in a few weeks time some
[1:09:10] of you would send me a text or an email
[1:09:12] and said brother Donnie you know what I
[1:09:14] I I embrace that truth of what you said
[1:09:17] there on that Wednesday I and God has
[1:09:19] been helping me and I've been averting
[1:09:22] this Pitfall I've been avoiding ing this
[1:09:24] I've been avoiding that wouldn't that be
[1:09:26] a wonderful testimony as a child of God
[1:09:29] not sure if you've got to repent the
[1:09:31] blood is there for it but why would we
[1:09:33] want to keep on fallowing the same thing
[1:09:35] over and over up and down and up and
[1:09:38] down and repenting and repent and
[1:09:40] repenting for the same thing over and
[1:09:42] over again when the spirit of Truth
[1:09:44] living inside of us can Empower us to
[1:09:47] say wait a minute he's got a trap set
[1:09:49] for you he's got a snare laid for you
[1:09:51] he's got this laid for you don't do that
[1:09:53] don't go that way amen is that what you
[1:09:57] want as a child of God to me that's an
[1:09:59] overcoming child of God now let's let's
[1:10:02] change a little bit and see what does
[1:10:04] the Holy Ghost then do inside of Holy
[1:10:08] Ghost filled Believers what what benefit
[1:10:10] really is it now I know there's an
[1:10:12] element of preachers in the message that
[1:10:14] preach believe it or not that whenever
[1:10:16] you actually accept Christ as your
[1:10:18] savior they still teach that you're born
[1:10:21] again that you are actually born again
[1:10:23] again when you repent but we know of
[1:10:27] course to the end of the prophet's
[1:10:28] Ministry that that's not what he taught
[1:10:30] that you are not fully even fully
[1:10:32] converted until you receive the Holy
[1:10:35] Ghost so they simply teach in that
[1:10:36] aspect that what happens to you is that
[1:10:39] you're born again whenever you accept
[1:10:41] the Lord and then if you receive the
[1:10:42] Holy Ghost all it does is give you a
[1:10:45] little bit of power to be able to
[1:10:46] empower you to do this and that and the
[1:10:48] other but I'm going to tell you one
[1:10:50] thing according to the Bible in Acts
[1:10:51] chap 1:8 you shall receive dunamus after
[1:10:56] that the Holy Ghost is come upon you so
[1:10:58] it's more than just a little bit of
[1:11:00] power it is God let me tell you tonight
[1:11:04] what the Holy Ghost is it's God let me
[1:11:09] tell you what it is not the Holy Ghost
[1:11:12] is not emotion the Holy Ghost is not
[1:11:15] jumping it is not shouting the Holy
[1:11:18] Ghost is not tongue now listen carefully
[1:11:20] before you get tied on me the Holy Ghost
[1:11:22] is not s
[1:11:24] the Holy Ghost produces sensation the
[1:11:27] Holy Ghost produces shouting but if I'm
[1:11:30] going to say the Holy Ghost is tongues
[1:11:32] then what I'm saying is God is tongues
[1:11:37] my God is more than tongues my God
[1:11:40] causes emotion my God causes sensation
[1:11:44] but my God is more than emotion my God
[1:11:48] is not an emotion praise the Lord so
[1:11:51] what then does the Holy Ghost do do in
[1:11:54] the recipients of this new life look at
[1:11:56] Mark
[1:11:58] 13:1 but when they shall lead you and
[1:12:01] deliver you up now Jesus talking about
[1:12:04] in the time of persecution the disciples
[1:12:06] are going to be persecuted for the cause
[1:12:08] of Christ and also would we now he's
[1:12:10] telling them what would happen once you
[1:12:13] get in these Straits take no thought
[1:12:16] beforehand what you shall speak neither
[1:12:19] do you
[1:12:21] premeditate but whatsoever shall be
[1:12:24] whatsoever shall be given unto you in
[1:12:26] that hour that speaky for it is not ye
[1:12:30] that speak but the Holy Ghost so he's
[1:12:34] talking about then one thing that the
[1:12:36] Holy Ghost would do is whenever you're
[1:12:39] brought before rulers magistrates maybe
[1:12:42] even on your job or whatever it is
[1:12:44] people that would question what you
[1:12:45] believe what you stand for then he says
[1:12:48] with the Holy Ghost Inside of You the
[1:12:51] Holy Ghost will give you the the words
[1:12:54] to say so this is one thing that the
[1:12:57] Holy Ghost will do inside of us I'm sure
[1:12:59] many of you have experienced that when
[1:13:01] you didn't know what to say and then all
[1:13:03] of a sudden something from within you
[1:13:05] just started answering and you were
[1:13:07] totally surprised yourself is that right
[1:13:10] well that's the holy ghost that does
[1:13:11] that notice again in Luke 12:2 for the
[1:13:15] Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same
[1:13:19] hour now this is Luke catching this is
[1:13:22] Luke's rendition of the same thing that
[1:13:24] Mark wrote and Luke wrote it just a
[1:13:26] little bit different for the Holy Ghost
[1:13:28] shall teach you in the same hour what
[1:13:32] you ought to say like you can imagine
[1:13:34] the spirit of God could have given you a
[1:13:37] week before why would he wait to the
[1:13:40] very hour you need
[1:13:41] it a't that amazing how God does that
[1:13:44] sometimes he loves to get us to a spot
[1:13:48] to where we're right on the brck of
[1:13:50] putting our foot in the Red Sea and then
[1:13:53] he comes on the scene so he could have
[1:13:56] given it to you a week before a day
[1:13:58] before a month before but instead he
[1:14:01] gives it to you that very hour he likes
[1:14:03] to keep his children under pressure
[1:14:05] sometimes St John
[1:14:08] 1426 but the comfort of which is the
[1:14:10] Holy Ghost whom the father was sent in
[1:14:13] my name he shall teach you again all
[1:14:16] things and bring all things to your
[1:14:21] remembrance now how do you figure
[1:14:23] Matthew Mark Luke and John was
[1:14:29] written Matthew was not written when
[1:14:32] Jesus was here Mark was not written when
[1:14:35] Jesus was here Luke was not written Luke
[1:14:39] was not even one of the original chosen
[1:14:43] disciples John was not written when
[1:14:46] Jesus was here so how did they recall
[1:14:50] all the Miracles how did they they
[1:14:53] recall the things that were said and the
[1:14:56] words that were said and the instances
[1:15:00] that were said when their gospels
[1:15:02] weren't written until some of them 30
[1:15:05] and 40 years after Jesus had
[1:15:09] left how many of y'all trust them
[1:15:12] gospels with all your
[1:15:14] heart so you know what you're trusted
[1:15:17] you're trusting men that were filled
[1:15:20] with the Holy Ghost and they were set
[1:15:23] the writing and the Holy Ghost brought
[1:15:26] it back to their
[1:15:29] remembrance praise be to God every time
[1:15:32] you pick up your New Testament and you
[1:15:35] read one of those four gospels you are
[1:15:38] reading the Fulfillment of this
[1:15:40] scripture not on only you but God still
[1:15:43] does the same thing Carol tells me all
[1:15:46] the time Donnie I wish sometimes that
[1:15:48] people could sit and hear the private
[1:15:52] interviews and just how the Lord will
[1:15:54] give you the things to say I said I know
[1:15:57] I I'm I'm just absolutely overwhelmed
[1:15:59] myself because the spirit of God will
[1:16:01] lead me down Avenues and say I haven't
[1:16:03] studied on a certain subject for for
[1:16:05] maybe months and months or maybe even
[1:16:07] years and I'll get in the channel same
[1:16:10] anointing out here but in a little
[1:16:12] different Channel and I'll get under
[1:16:13] that channel and I'll go to quoting
[1:16:15] scriptures and it comes out of there and
[1:16:17] I say where in the world does all of
[1:16:20] that come from and quotes that I am
[1:16:23] quoted in years and God will just lay
[1:16:25] that out of there and I've seen him set
[1:16:28] people free by that word I've seen the
[1:16:30] devil crawl out beat and bruised black
[1:16:33] and blue and it wasn't because I
[1:16:35] premeditated it I didn't even think
[1:16:38] about it I didn't remember it and yet
[1:16:40] the Holy Ghost will come and it will lay
[1:16:42] it out there so perfectly that it it
[1:16:45] just mesmerizes me well you say why
[1:16:48] would it do you cuz it ain't me doing it
[1:16:50] that's why it's the spirit of God
[1:16:53] anointing the gift in my life but also
[1:16:56] anointing my memory and recalling things
[1:16:59] that I might not have quoted for years
[1:17:02] and yet what is it as I sat there I'm
[1:17:06] fulfilling what Jesus said again just
[1:17:09] way some of you will maybe not as many
[1:17:12] times but when you don't even know how
[1:17:14] to answer what to say and all of a
[1:17:16] sudden the scripture will pop into your
[1:17:18] mind maybe you haven't thought about it
[1:17:20] for months or maybe even years before
[1:17:23] what is that that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:17:25] wants to do inside of every one of us
[1:17:29] now notice Jesus said he will bring all
[1:17:32] things to your remembrance whatsoever I
[1:17:36] have second you imagine now Matthew
[1:17:37] years and years later and he was setting
[1:17:40] down now the Gospel of Jesus Christ is
[1:17:43] on this wise and then he would go to
[1:17:45] take a Matthew took it from one angle
[1:17:47] mark from another angle Luke from
[1:17:49] another angle of course one of Son of
[1:17:51] God Son of Man the Incarnate Word every
[1:17:53] one of them and the spirit of God
[1:17:55] brought to their remembrance different
[1:17:58] aspects of the exact same story and
[1:18:02] would bring to Matthew while have four
[1:18:04] gospels if they're all going to say
[1:18:06] exactly the same thing and tell the
[1:18:08] exact same story in the same way you
[1:18:10] don't need one and yet every one of them
[1:18:13] wrote it a little bit different so the
[1:18:15] Holy Ghost captivated Matthew and opened
[1:18:18] up his remembrance to certain things and
[1:18:21] Mark he didn't Mark only wrote 16
[1:18:24] chapters did you know it's the shortest
[1:18:25] one of the four gospels and yet Mark's
[1:18:28] recall was totally different and Luke's
[1:18:31] recall was totally different and where
[1:18:33] did Luke get his he wasn't even there
[1:18:36] when Jesus said it but Luke traveled
[1:18:38] around with Paul remember Luke was a
[1:18:40] physician he was a Jew but he was of
[1:18:43] Greek upbringing very intellectual a man
[1:18:46] of great wisdom and also a great
[1:18:48] understanding so Luke went around
[1:18:50] remember he traveled with this preacher
[1:18:52] that got through throwed in jail all the
[1:18:53] time how would you like that to be your
[1:18:56] pastor and God throw in jail all the
[1:18:58] time so Luke had a lot of spare time on
[1:19:00] his hands so history tells us that Luke
[1:19:02] would go around so when they would come
[1:19:05] into capernium when they would come into
[1:19:07] Cyprus when they'd come into these
[1:19:08] different places and Luke go around say
[1:19:10] is there anybody here that knows about
[1:19:12] Jesus is there anybody here that was in
[1:19:14] the meetings of Jesus what he get with
[1:19:15] them and he write down their their
[1:19:17] stories oh my and then what was it the
[1:19:19] Holy Ghost on them years after it had
[1:19:22] happened and the holy ghost coming on
[1:19:24] this woman coming on this man and Luke
[1:19:26] said you got any more have you got any
[1:19:28] more tell me more look do you understand
[1:19:30] how your new testament was written do
[1:19:33] you think it's just a bunch of men that
[1:19:35] done it the Holy Ghost wrote the New
[1:19:38] Testament it was the spirit of truth and
[1:19:41] the same Holy Ghost is what it's going
[1:19:43] to take to help us understand
[1:19:46] it now notice Jesus before he ascends up
[1:19:49] into heaven acts 1:7 and he said unto
[1:19:51] them it is not for you to know the times
[1:19:54] of the seasons which a father has put in
[1:19:56] his own power but you shall receive
[1:20:00] dunamus power after that the Holy Ghost
[1:20:04] has come upon you I know you know the
[1:20:05] meaning of this word I've shared it with
[1:20:07] you for so many years but let's look at
[1:20:09] it again inherent power now remember
[1:20:13] this is different than exusia exusia is
[1:20:17] an authority given to you but it's not
[1:20:20] something that is yours it's not
[1:20:23] something that lives in you it's like a
[1:20:25] State Trooper or a magistrate or a
[1:20:27] police or a mayor or a governor he's
[1:20:29] voted in or he's hired or he's appointed
[1:20:32] he loses his job he loses his power he
[1:20:35] loses his authority but Jesus did not
[1:20:38] want the New Testament Church to be
[1:20:40] built upon excuse you that's what the
[1:20:42] apostles had that's the way they cast
[1:20:44] out Devils so it might help you to
[1:20:46] understand how you say how in the world
[1:20:48] brother Donnie could could Judas cast
[1:20:50] out Devils because he had excused IIA
[1:20:53] written as we'd say written Authority in
[1:20:56] this day by the law of St Tri said you
[1:20:58] see somebody speeding we give you the
[1:21:00] authority to pull them over we give you
[1:21:02] the authority to check the driver's
[1:21:04] license ask for their insurance card we
[1:21:06] give you that Authority it's written in
[1:21:08] our law you've got that job you can do
[1:21:10] it so here Judas was sent out under the
[1:21:13] power of exusia it was a delegated
[1:21:17] authority not an inherit nature but
[1:21:20] Jesus did not want to build bu his
[1:21:23] church on a delegated authority but he
[1:21:26] wanted to build it on an inherit nature
[1:21:29] an inherit power power residing In A
[1:21:33] Thing by virtue of its nature or which a
[1:21:39] person or thing exerts and puts forth
[1:21:42] moral power and Excellence of Soul so
[1:21:47] Judas didn't have this no sir he had
[1:21:50] what Matthew 10 go preach
[1:21:54] he was hard for the
[1:21:56] job he was hard you understand so he was
[1:21:59] given excuse him so he went out cast out
[1:22:03] Devils healed the sick preached he was
[1:22:06] not inferior to the rest of them he done
[1:22:08] exactly the same stuff they did on what
[1:22:10] what basis on excuse him but you don't
[1:22:13] find Judah showing up on the day of
[1:22:15] Pentecost now notice Jesus says you
[1:22:19] shall receive power after that the Holy
[1:22:22] Ghost has come upon you and you shall be
[1:22:24] Witnesses unto me in Jerusalem and all
[1:22:26] Judea and in Samaria here we go now
[1:22:28] Beyond them and unto the uttermost part
[1:22:32] of the earth Romans chap 14:1 17 for the
[1:22:36] kingdom of God is Not meat and drink but
[1:22:42] righteousness
[1:22:44] and
[1:22:45] peace
[1:22:48] and in the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost
[1:22:52] don't just show you things to come and
[1:22:55] give you the right things to say at the
[1:22:57] right time but the Holy Ghost is joy and
[1:23:02] peace and
[1:23:04] righteousness how many feels like you
[1:23:06] might need another dose of that tonight
[1:23:08] oh my Romans
[1:23:10] 15:13 now the God of Peace fill you with
[1:23:14] all joy and peace in believing that you
[1:23:19] may abound in Hope through the the
[1:23:23] power of the Holy
[1:23:25] Ghost through the power of the Holy
[1:23:29] Ghost I know we're living in the last
[1:23:31] day and I know we're living in difficult
[1:23:34] times but I still believe as one child
[1:23:37] of God there's joy in the Holy Ghost
[1:23:40] amen I believe there's power in the Holy
[1:23:43] Ghost anybody else here with me tonight
[1:23:45] believe that there's joy unspeakable and
[1:23:48] full of Glory I believe a person I know
[1:23:51] you going to say I'm crazy I believe a
[1:23:54] person can be so full of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:56] they can still shout they can still
[1:23:59] dance I believe a child of God can get
[1:24:01] so full of the Holy Ghost they could be
[1:24:03] drunk on the spirit of God
[1:24:06] [Applause]
[1:24:08] Amen I realize some of y'all are so
[1:24:10] drunk you're about the stage of passing
[1:24:12] out you know you're just so so drunk I
[1:24:15] believe you can get so drunk that the
[1:24:17] prophet said you don't even know what
[1:24:19] your name
[1:24:20] is the D 2024 I know that I realize that
[1:24:25] but I've not found where on any of these
[1:24:28] scriptures that it gave a time limit
[1:24:31] that it said well up to 1989 up to 1995
[1:24:35] up to 2024 I'm not found that there's no
[1:24:38] end to it if the Holy Ghost cannot be
[1:24:41] Joy tonight then somehow I figure I got
[1:24:44] cheated I must have got a watered down
[1:24:47] version that is not the same thing that
[1:24:50] Peter and them have because they were
[1:24:52] beat they were whipped and whenever they
[1:24:54] come to their s they was rejoicing and
[1:24:57] shouting and praising God that they had
[1:25:00] been counted worthy to be beat for his
[1:25:03] name well praise the Lord notice now
[1:25:07] let's let's look a little bit in the
[1:25:09] direction of the message if you don't
[1:25:10] mind the prophet said the Holy Ghost in
[1:25:13] you has to Bear record to the
[1:25:17] resurrection and Jesus being the Son of
[1:25:20] God now watch now the personal
[1:25:23] identification in you as an individual
[1:25:26] not not us as a church not you and your
[1:25:29] family but you as an individual is the
[1:25:32] Holy Ghost in you will have a personal
[1:25:36] Vindication of the resurrection and that
[1:25:39] Jesus is the son of God or you're only
[1:25:43] taking somebody else's word for it
[1:25:46] you're only taking what the Bible says
[1:25:49] and he said the Bible's right and you're
[1:25:51] only taking what the minister says but
[1:25:54] you see you can take what the Bible says
[1:25:57] here intellectually faith and still not
[1:26:00] be a Vindication in your own life
[1:26:03] brother joh what you saying what do you
[1:26:05] mean it means you have raised from the
[1:26:09] dead because you have received the
[1:26:11] resurrection power in you you're not the
[1:26:15] same person you're not living the same
[1:26:18] way you're not acting the same way
[1:26:20] you're not talking the same way you
[1:26:24] yourself are a proof that Calvary was a
[1:26:29] success because you lived a life in sin
[1:26:32] and darkness of the world but now you
[1:26:36] have
[1:26:37] raised from the
[1:26:40] dead I don't to make a Baptist want to
[1:26:43] shout now watch's this what was the Holy
[1:26:46] Ghost given for God wants to bring the
[1:26:49] Holy Ghost In You
[1:26:52] to
[1:26:54] continue the same work that he was doing
[1:26:59] in
[1:27:03] Christ well then we've got to believe
[1:27:07] that God still wants to do them same
[1:27:09] works
[1:27:10] right what did he do when he was
[1:27:13] here did Jesus just go around say I tell
[1:27:16] you what we're going to start a church
[1:27:18] and uh we we just want to bring
[1:27:20] everybody in and just y'all y'all
[1:27:22] believe I'm the Son of God y y'all
[1:27:24] believe that I come to save you from
[1:27:25] your sins uh and and we won't we won't
[1:27:27] do no signs now and allone that sort of
[1:27:29] thing and we won't preach hard we won't
[1:27:31] preach on nobody was that what Jesus
[1:27:33] said is that the way jesus carried it
[1:27:35] out no it wasn't and it wasn't the way
[1:27:37] his Apostles carried it out so we got
[1:27:40] identify then what was the works that he
[1:27:43] done what he told us these signs shall
[1:27:45] follow them that believe in my name they
[1:27:49] shall cast out Devils they'll speak with
[1:27:52] with new tongues they'll heal the sick
[1:27:55] right so the Holy Ghost come back in me
[1:27:58] and you so brother Dar is that mean then
[1:28:00] that every man every woman every boy and
[1:28:03] every girl is is going to do the same
[1:28:05] thing as preachers no we know that
[1:28:07] already we've done been through that for
[1:28:09] years and years and you know that
[1:28:11] everyone is not going to do the exact
[1:28:13] same sign if you'll study your Bible
[1:28:16] real close you will find out there was
[1:28:19] certain Apostles that did more signs
[1:28:23] than the others now I know which one it
[1:28:24] is but I ain't going to tell
[1:28:26] you some of Y all tanking lazy right now

[1:29:23] I love the way brother Ram deals with
[1:29:25] this he said now the work wasn't so
[1:29:29] needy in the days of lucer that was
[1:29:31] God's church he says but it wasn't but a
[1:29:35] little bit more needer in the days of
[1:29:38] Wesley because the world the Bible said
[1:29:40] it would get weaker and wiser and the
[1:29:42] more wicked all the time and the world
[1:29:43] is getting more wicked can you imagine
[1:29:46] this is 1959 when he said this what
[1:29:49] would he say now men do things today
[1:29:52] that a hundred years ago you wouldn't
[1:29:54] have thought that been a human being
[1:29:56] that cruel and they're more wicked all
[1:29:59] the time and the wicked do
[1:30:02] wickeder now you might not find that at
[1:30:04] the University of some you know great
[1:30:06] speaker but it's Kentuck in case you
[1:30:08] didn't know it the wicked are more
[1:30:10] wickeder and the sorry are more sorer
[1:30:13] and the rottener more
[1:30:17] rottener everybody understand that plain
[1:30:19] English the wicked shall be more
[1:30:22] wickeder all the time said the scripture
[1:30:24] more and more so the Holy Spirit has
[1:30:27] been moving now listen there was just a
[1:30:33] little breath of it was looser and a
[1:30:38] little
[1:30:40] blow of it with Wesley and a
[1:30:44] deeper blow with Pentecost now the
[1:30:49] breath and the spirit GL to God now the
[1:30:54] breath and the spirit has become the
[1:30:57] same she's uniting together bringing
[1:31:00] forth that same powerful blow of the
[1:31:05] Holy Ghost like he did back there is
[1:31:08] manifesting the same works that he did
[1:31:11] back there manifested right today the
[1:31:14] same
[1:31:15] thing praise be to
[1:31:18] God we're on I'm on a Minister's chat
[1:31:21] brother now was telling about four
[1:31:22] church and there was a brother from the
[1:31:24] Philippines had went and preached in a
[1:31:27] certain Island there was a woman there
[1:31:28] in the hospital that had had a major
[1:31:30] stroke and know it was awful the the the
[1:31:33] shape that it left the woman in but
[1:31:35] someone had called for the preacher to
[1:31:37] come there m his brother preached the
[1:31:39] word for years so he goes out of that
[1:31:41] place and that hospital and prays for
[1:31:44] her and God does such Supernatural
[1:31:47] miracle in the life of that woman that
[1:31:50] he had a picture and he post posted it
[1:31:52] on this thing today and he showed the
[1:31:54] woman laying there in the bed worshiping
[1:31:56] and praising God after the miraculous
[1:31:58] power of God had come down in the room
[1:32:00] and the next day her daughter which was
[1:32:02] there in the room when the miracle took
[1:32:05] place her daughter come back and said I
[1:32:07] want to give my heart to God I want to
[1:32:09] be baptized I want to be baptized don't
[1:32:11] you understand that's what Divine
[1:32:13] Healing is it's a bait on the hook so
[1:32:18] you don't you don't let the fish see the
[1:32:20] hook you let the fish see the bait so
[1:32:23] then you put it on there and you show it
[1:32:25] out and they see a supernatural God
[1:32:28] moving Among Us and they'll say that's a
[1:32:31] kind of God I want that's the kind of
[1:32:33] God I'll serve a God that can heal the
[1:32:35] sick a God that can save Sinners of God
[1:32:38] that can take a man and turn him from
[1:32:40] being a drunk and a liar and a wher and

[1:32:50] our church that that's the kind of God
[1:32:52] we have in our
[1:32:56] church hallelujah
[1:32:59] hallelujah now notice how the intensity
[1:33:02] of this goes with a little breath from a
[1:33:06] breath to a little blow from that to a
[1:33:09] deeper blow and then the breast and the
[1:33:12] spirit become the same youting bringing
[1:33:16] forth that same powerful blow of the
[1:33:19] Holy Ghost like like he did back then
[1:33:22] manifesting the same Works he did back

[1:39:06] grave it brings
[1:39:09] you from the
[1:39:12] grave some will be brought
[1:39:15] twice they'll be brought spiritually
[1:39:18] from the grave of sin and go by the way
[1:39:20] of the grave of of course and experience
[1:39:22] the
[1:39:24] resurrection Jesus said there would be
[1:39:27] some that would go to the resurrection
[1:39:29] as a matter of fact he gave them a
[1:39:32] particular
[1:39:33] name and he calls them
[1:39:37] children of the
[1:39:41] Resurrection
[1:39:42] Children of the Resurrection well I
[1:39:45] don't know if that's my lot or not but I
[1:39:48] figure there's only one of two things
[1:39:51] things I can be called a child of the
[1:39:55] Resurrection or a child of the
[1:39:58] change don't really matter to me I'm a
[1:40:00] winner either
[1:40:01] way some of our loved ones some of our
[1:40:04] friends have been committed to be
[1:40:07] Children of the Resurrection oh I know
[1:40:10] we grieve and we're so sad for their
[1:40:12] departure but let me tell you one thing
[1:40:14] that God had on us in one way I said
[1:40:16] they've got it on us in one way they're
[1:40:18] there in the presence of God tonight
[1:40:21] rejoicing and praising God no more
[1:40:23] sadness no more sorrow not only that
[1:40:26] they beat us up praise God they beat us
[1:40:30] up they will arise first and we'll look
[1:40:33] around some morning and see them
[1:40:34] standing there in our room and we know
[1:40:37] it won't be long we are going to be
[1:40:39] changed in a moment in a twinkling of an
[1:40:42] eye Children of the Resurrection you see
[1:40:46] the token is required in order to be
[1:40:50] accepted in the first resurrection
[1:40:52] that's why Paul said we sorrow not as
[1:40:55] others who have no hope for if we
[1:40:57] believe that Jesus died and rose again
[1:40:59] then what sleep in Jesus will God bring
[1:41:02] with him can you imagine saying brother
[1:41:05] Jim B my daughter Erica your loved ones
[1:41:08] and Friends when the Lord Jesus comes
[1:41:10] back he's going to bring Erica with him
[1:41:13] when Jesus comes back he's going to
[1:41:15] bring brother Jim bad with him that's
[1:41:17] right he will bring with him when he
[1:41:20] comes
[1:41:22] Hallelujah that they stand around him
[1:41:25] and he will say you are my proof you are
[1:41:29] my proof I did not die in vain go get
[1:41:32] your
[1:41:36] [Applause]
[1:41:40] family
[1:41:43] Hallelujah if y'all wouldn't here
[1:41:45] tonight I just shout a
[1:41:49] spell h
[1:41:51] Hallelujah notice in Romans
[1:41:56] 8:7 because a carnal mind is enity
[1:41:58] against God for it is not subject to the
[1:42:01] law of God neither indeed can be so then
[1:42:04] they that are in the
[1:42:06] flesh cannot please
[1:42:09] God but ye are not in the
[1:42:13] flesh but in the
[1:42:15] spirit now he's not saying that the
[1:42:17] Roman Christians are out of their
[1:42:19] body
[1:42:21] but he's pointing them back to a time
[1:42:23] that the enmity not only rule their
[1:42:26] flesh it rule their
[1:42:28] soul you understand you was at war with
[1:42:33] God before you got saved you were at war
[1:42:38] with
[1:42:39] God but once you received the Holy Ghost
[1:42:42] Jesus Christ waved the Peace Flag and
[1:42:46] made a union in between you and God and
[1:42:48] the war has been settled forever God was
[1:42:52] on one side you was on another the Lord
[1:42:54] Jesus bridged the gap between God the
[1:42:56] Eternal and man a time being stood there
[1:42:59] in the middle and brought them both
[1:43:01] together so God and man can meet in
[1:43:05] Christ Jesus Oh Glory to God friends
[1:43:07] that's as simple as I know how to put
[1:43:08] the Plan of Redemption and in you in you
[1:43:12] the Plan of Redemption is made manifest
[1:43:14] and you have that peace between you and
[1:43:17] God you're no more at war with him
[1:43:19] you're not fighting him you're not
[1:43:20] against his will you're not against his
[1:43:22] program you're at peace with
[1:43:26] God praise God but ye are not in the
[1:43:30] flesh but in the spirit if so be the
[1:43:33] spirit of God dwell in you we are his
[1:43:39] Temple now if any man have not the
[1:43:42] spirit of
[1:43:45] Christ notice he doesn't say have his
[1:43:49] Bible quot the scriptures but you got to
[1:43:52] have his Spirit which is what Holy Ghost
[1:43:56] verse 11 if the spirit of him now this
[1:43:59] is one of my favorite scriptures and I
[1:44:01] was a Pentecostal preacher Romans
[1:44:05] 8:11 if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:44:08] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[1:44:12] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[1:44:15] also Quicken your mortal bodies and that
[1:44:19] was the scripture that we used for
[1:44:22] shouting right brother
[1:44:24] Melvin right brother Emanuel so the
[1:44:28] spirit of God comes on you it'll Quicken
[1:44:30] your mortal body Hallelujah glory to God
[1:44:33] here we go oh
[1:44:35] Hallelujah but when you look at what
[1:44:37] Paul is saying he's talking about those
[1:44:40] of us that were
[1:44:42] dead in sin and Christ the Holy Ghost
[1:44:47] resurrected us and changed us and he
[1:44:50] will also Quicken our mortal body think
[1:44:53] of it in a moment in a twinkling of an
[1:44:57] eye you'll be
[1:44:59] changed oh praise the Lord 1 Corinthians
[1:45:02] 6:19 what know ye not that your body is
[1:45:05] a
[1:45:11] temple how many of you would come in
[1:45:13] this
[1:45:15] place bring
[1:45:17] coffee
[1:45:19] Donuts your lunch your
[1:45:24] supper how many of you would come in
[1:45:26] here and get up on the platform or sit
[1:45:29] there in the chairs and go to telling
[1:45:33] you know questionable jokes things like
[1:45:35] that oh no Lord have mercy no I would
[1:45:38] never do
[1:45:41] that you won't do it in this
[1:45:44] house well what about this
[1:45:49] one so unlike to Heathen we don't pack
[1:45:53] an idol around in our arm we pack our
[1:45:56] guard around in our
[1:45:58] heart and we are his place of worship
[1:46:02] this is why I don't have to wait to be
[1:46:04] in church to worship God I worship him
[1:46:06] every day of my life off and on all day
[1:46:09] even in the night if I wake up in the
[1:46:11] night and if I wake up early in the
[1:46:12] morning which I do a lot on the first
[1:46:14] things comes out of my mouth is praise
[1:46:16] and worship to my Lord because I my body
[1:46:20] is his Temple and from the temple of God
[1:46:24] I can be able to give him sacrificial
[1:46:27] worship and praise whether I feel like
[1:46:29] it or not that has absolutely nothing to
[1:46:30] do with it and because my life has been
[1:46:32] touched by the original fire of God I
[1:46:36] will not be slain the way Aaron's two
[1:46:39] sons were you see Aaron's two sons on
[1:46:42] the very first day of Aaron's Service as
[1:46:46] being the high priest they go and offer
[1:46:49] Strange Fire
[1:46:50] before the Lord now what they did was
[1:46:53] according to the law of God they were
[1:46:55] supposed to everything that they did was
[1:46:57] supposed to come from the original
[1:46:59] lighting of fire off of the altar of God
[1:47:03] which was lit supernaturally so the
[1:47:06] spirit of God come down and lit that and
[1:47:09] every fire they built from that day on
[1:47:11] was supposed to be built from that
[1:47:13] original lighting of fire but Aaron's
[1:47:16] sons they got in there and the Bible
[1:47:19] says they offered
[1:47:21] Strange Fire before the Lord so their
[1:47:25] fire did not come from the original
[1:47:28] lighting look it up in the Hebrew Su it
[1:47:31] did not come from the original lighting
[1:47:35] Satan has had strange
[1:47:37] fire in every
[1:47:40] age it looks like fire it burns like
[1:47:44] fire it can consume like
[1:47:47] fire but where did it come from
[1:47:51] and God killed both of those
[1:47:55] men because they had the wrong fire look
[1:47:59] children I want us to be on fire with
[1:48:01] the Holy Ghost but I want to make sure
[1:48:03] what's lighting us up is from the
[1:48:06] original lighting come on somebody oh
[1:48:10] we're too close we're too close we want
[1:48:12] to make sure oh but it looks like fire
[1:48:15] it burns like fire it feels like fire it
[1:48:18] warms it stirs you you can feel it oh
[1:48:21] yeah yeah fire will burn you the wrong
[1:48:23] fire could have burnt them but it come
[1:48:25] from the wrong place so when you as a
[1:48:29] worshipper of God receive the Holy Ghost
[1:48:31] and your Nature has been annihilated
[1:48:34] then from the temple within you your
[1:48:36] soul you are offering from the original
[1:48:39] altar of God and from the original fire
[1:48:42] you've got the same Holy Ghost Peter had
[1:48:45] so you're standing in lows you're in
[1:48:47] Food City you're you know at a pond
[1:48:49] fishing somewhere what whatever you're
[1:48:50] doing you can raise your hands right
[1:48:52] there where you are and you're not
[1:48:54] offering Strange Fire Baptist fire
[1:48:56] Methodist fire you know whatever kind of
[1:48:58] fire but you've got the same fire that
[1:49:01] Peter had on the day of Pentecost and
[1:49:03] you can worship God and God will accept
[1:49:06] you standing out beside a creek God
[1:49:08] would accept you standing out you know
[1:49:09] Gathering your cows for milk and them or
[1:49:11] whatever more just the same way he would
[1:49:13] standing right here in this church
[1:49:15] building is that right why because you
[1:49:17] have become the temple of God and fire
[1:49:20] of God when we dedicated this place I
[1:49:23] didn't see that fire burning on the fuse
[1:49:25] oh some people seen the pillar of fire
[1:49:27] Angel the Lord's been seeing in your
[1:49:29] several times since we've been here I
[1:49:31] personally didn't see a burning fire
[1:49:33] here but I saw it in you I saw it in you
[1:49:37] does God want to catch this building on
[1:49:38] fire he wants to catch us on
[1:49:41] fire with what the same fire that fell
[1:49:46] on the day of
[1:49:48] Pentecost praise be to God can I go just
[1:49:51] a couple more minutes notice in another
[1:49:53] thing that the Holy Ghost is in
[1:49:55] Ephesians chap 1:12 it's our down
[1:49:58] payment that we should be to the praise
[1:50:01] of his glory who first trusted in Christ
[1:50:03] and whom you also trusted after that you
[1:50:07] heard the word of Truth The Gospel of
[1:50:10] your salvation and whom also after that
[1:50:14] you
[1:50:16] believed not when you believed but after
[1:50:19] that you believed you were sealed with
[1:50:23] that Holy Spirit of Promise that's the
[1:50:25] Bible you get the Holy Ghost after you
[1:50:30] believe so what is it notice in verse 14
[1:50:34] which is the
[1:50:36] earnest of our inheritance look at the
[1:50:39] meaning money which in purchases is
[1:50:43] given as a pledge or a down payment all
[1:50:48] of us know what what that is you bought
[1:50:50] a house you bought a car whatever it is
[1:50:51] so it's a down payment that the full
[1:50:55] amount will subsequently be paid so God
[1:51:00] gives us a down payment earnest money
[1:51:04] it's a down payment you're going to get
[1:51:06] the full thing in the full
[1:51:09] Resurrection praise be to God so what is
[1:51:13] the Holy
[1:51:16] Ghost it's your
[1:51:18] part of
[1:51:22] [Music]
[1:51:28] deity
[1:51:30] brother when the deity of God by the
[1:51:33] Holy Ghost comes into the human
[1:51:36] heart it calls out everything that
[1:51:39] Christ hasn't
[1:51:41] created you know that's the
[1:51:45] truth
[1:51:48] deity deity
[1:51:51] brother Donnie
[1:51:52] that's isn't that part of the godhead ah
[1:51:56] you have been
[1:51:57] listening it is part of the
[1:52:03] godhead it's that part of
[1:52:06] himself that was revealed in the
[1:52:09] type of
[1:52:13] Eve so God made man in his own image
[1:52:18] male and female created did he them and
[1:52:21] called their name Adam so Adam was both
[1:52:25] man and woman in his spirit is that
[1:52:29] right I think about it
[1:52:32] yesterday who but God who but God a
[1:52:36] title for a sermon who but God who but
[1:52:39] God could take this Earth in a chaos and
[1:52:41] turn it into a paradise Who but God
[1:52:46] could take dust dust off the top of the
[1:52:49] Earth
[1:52:50] and transform that dust into a heart
[1:52:54] liver kidneys lungs eyeballs ears skin
[1:52:59] muscle hair tissue senu turn it who but
[1:53:04] God could take a rib and turn it into
[1:53:08] the most beautiful woman that ever lived
[1:53:10] on the face of the Earth who could God
[1:53:13] could take a wretched Sinner and turn
[1:53:15] them into a child of God who but God can
[1:53:19] take this earth when Satan gets done
[1:53:21] with it I'm telling you it's going to be
[1:53:23] a mess and when God allows man to be
[1:53:26] able to bring it to a place of almost
[1:53:28] total
[1:53:30] Annihilation think of it the
[1:53:33] premillennium condition will be atomic
[1:53:35] bombs falling everywhere and we will
[1:53:38] actually walk out on the
[1:53:41] ashes of the wicked who but God could
[1:53:45] take the Earth in that stage and in a
[1:53:48] moment
[1:53:51] turn it into another
[1:53:55] paradise Who but God could take us a
[1:53:58] bunch of hardheaded stubborn no good no
[1:54:02] count good for nothing human beings and
[1:54:05] turn us into Tabernacles for deity who
[1:54:08] but God could take our unbelieving
[1:54:10] hearts and drive that Spirit of evil
[1:54:13] away from us and fill us with the Holy
[1:54:15] Ghost and we just love him and praise
[1:54:18] him and long for him and even when he
[1:54:21] does something that we don't understand
[1:54:23] and he he he kind of forces his will on
[1:54:25] us sometimes and we say no no no no no
[1:54:28] don't do that please don't do that I
[1:54:29] don't want that I no I can't do that God
[1:54:32] and somehow he turns us around and so
[1:54:35] moves us and makes that same person that
[1:54:38] was arguing with him and debating with
[1:54:39] him and he sues them and bathes them in
[1:54:42] his Beauty and bathes them in his nature
[1:54:45] and when he gets done with them they
[1:54:46] just turn right back around and say not
[1:54:49] my will
[1:54:50] but yours be
[1:54:56] done and you all are wanting to see
[1:54:59] Miracles yall are wanting to see signs
[1:55:02] that are so tremendous you'll hardly
[1:55:05] ever see a more rare one that God can
[1:55:08] take a stubborn man or a stubborn woman
[1:55:11] and so transform them to the will of God
[1:55:14] and God will turn right around and point
[1:55:16] that one to the devil and said let's see
[1:55:19] you do
[1:55:20] it I tell you what God can do God can
[1:55:23] say I can be able to perform signs and
[1:55:27] Satan can stand up and say so can
[1:55:30] I your sons can be able to perform
[1:55:33] Miracles and I'll send my false
[1:55:36] preachers out there and they'll do the
[1:55:37] same thing your boys
[1:55:40] do
[1:55:43] on but only
[1:55:45] God Only
[1:55:47] God can take an unregenerate person
[1:55:50] let's just be honest some of us in such
[1:55:51] a bad shape the devil said I don't think
[1:55:53] I even want them no more I don't want
[1:55:56] them belong to my tribe and God says
[1:55:58] I'll take
[1:55:59] them I'll take them he takes them
[1:56:02] changes them transforms them oh glory to
[1:56:06] God and not only just beats them just
[1:56:09] beats them just beats them no he don't
[1:56:11] even do that and Satan's looking at say
[1:56:14] how does he do that he don't have chains
[1:56:15] on Satan puts chains on his that' run
[1:56:18] away if he didn't have them he puts
[1:56:20] chains of alcohol chains of smoking
[1:56:22] chains of drug addiction come on
[1:56:24] somebody Jesus don't hold us with

[1:59:55] power and
[1:59:58] deity because
[2:00:00] deity will be
[2:00:03] revealed in human
[2:00:05] beings by the Holy
[2:00:08] Spirit bringing to pass the
[2:00:13] thought of their
[2:00:18] mind
[2:00:21] bringing to pass the
[2:00:24] thought of their
[2:00:28] mind well I don't mind telling you but
[2:00:31] if I'm
[2:00:33] alive I hope I am to see
[2:00:36] this but can you imagine when we get
[2:00:39] that place in Christ
[2:00:42] Jesus I
[2:00:45] just can't keep from believing and
[2:00:47] imagining in my own soul soul that one
[2:00:50] of the last
[2:00:54] thoughts that would be in my mind
[2:00:57] is I want to be
[2:01:06] changed so what it'll do it'll spread
[2:01:10] the
[2:01:12] Earth you imagine the mind that was in
[2:01:15] Christ Jesus is in every believer there
[2:01:19] is the soul Soul's in prison now
[2:01:22] November 63 mind that was in Christ
[2:01:25] Jesus so all God has to do from the
[2:01:28] throne is
[2:01:30] think one
[2:01:34] thought
[2:01:37] today is the
[2:01:40] rapture every person with that
[2:01:44] mind receives the same
[2:01:47] thought at the same same
[2:01:53] moment why it's the same mind in every
[2:01:57] believer so God going have to think it
[2:01:59] in heaven and then think it in Paul and
[2:02:01] then think it in Peter and then my
[2:02:03] goodness time it gets down here to us
[2:02:05] we'll be aged another 10 years but if
[2:02:07] we've all got the same mind now listen
[2:02:10] to me if we've all got the same mind
[2:02:13] then the spirit of God could think it
[2:02:16] from the control tower and every every
[2:02:19] member on the
[2:02:20] earth they might be laying you know
[2:02:23] might be in Africa and they might be in
[2:02:24] the
[2:02:25] nighttime but all of a sudden the
[2:02:27] thought of the
[2:02:32] Rapture and here we are on the bright
[2:02:34] side of the earth it hits us
[2:02:37] all at the same time text ain't fast
[2:02:42] enough WhatsApp forget it old
[2:02:46] school
[2:02:47] supersonic
[2:02:50] so I mean I don't know maybe I'm kind of
[2:02:53] weird but if I'm on to travel lock
[2:02:58] assault wouldn't I have to be
[2:03:03] one after all how did I get here in the
[2:03:06] first
[2:03:07] place I traveled as a thought from the
[2:03:11] mind of
[2:03:13] God glory to God thank you Jesus how am
[2:03:17] I going back
[2:03:19] that same thought in a glorified changed
[2:03:23] form J don't you see how how important
[2:03:26] the mind of Christ is no wonder says in
[2:03:28] the seven seal when the supernatural
[2:03:31] comes in that's the mind of Christ
[2:03:34] that's how God projects to you visions
[2:03:37] and Supernatural oh so oh better I've
[2:03:40] never had it yes you
[2:03:43] have if you've ever received a divine
[2:03:45] revelation from almighty God after
[2:03:49] receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:03:51] you were tapped in to the mind of
[2:03:55] Christ that's the way God projects it
[2:03:59] and you just stand in there and say oh
[2:04:01] my goodness I see it I see it well what
[2:04:06] happened to you a thought from God said
[2:04:10] Son see it and you on Earth said I see
[2:04:17] it
[2:04:19] God will say change and you'll say I'm
[2:04:23] changed am God will say
[2:04:27] resurrection and they'll be loosed out
[2:04:29] from under the altar from the sixth
[2:04:33] Dimension glory to God and they'll come
[2:04:36] to Earth to take our
[2:04:41] bodies think of it missing people they
[2:04:45] can't find you no more cuz you're
[2:04:47] getting together with with the rest of
[2:04:49] the group and you come up missing on the
[2:04:56] earth missing you come up missing on the
[2:05:00] earth like that movie I saw when I was a
[2:05:03] boy it's scared the liver out of me it
[2:05:05] still scares me much if I think about it
[2:05:07] now and there's this guy living in his
[2:05:10] bedroom and he happened to hit a certain
[2:05:12] place on that wall one
[2:05:14] day I see some of y'all still scared by
[2:05:16] it too and that guy through that wall
[2:05:20] and was like moving into another
[2:05:22] dimension if Alfred Hitchcock makes it
[2:05:24] through the Gates of Heaven I don't know
[2:05:26] how in the world it could ever
[2:05:28] happen but that's always stuck with
[2:05:32] me dimensional travel traveling like a
[2:05:35] thought now I'm really going to convince
[2:05:37] you I'm a Nut
[2:05:38] right think of it children we're living
[2:05:42] in that hour when our thoughts will
[2:05:47] become material
[2:05:49] we won't have to beat it up with the
[2:05:50] music we won't have to shout it down
[2:05:53] jump it down he'll project it
[2:05:57] down don't you want to be part of
[2:06:01] it it's bow our heads tonight can

[2:06:12] lord lord

[2:06:24] break it down in our
[2:06:27] hearts Lord we live so far beneath our
[2:06:31] privileges we just let the devil wear us
[2:06:34] out over this and that and the other
[2:06:37] and how high you want to take
[2:06:41] us Lord God help us that we can latch on
[2:06:45] to your
[2:06:46] wings and soar in the Heavenly

[2:07:10] day I thank you that the intensity of
[2:07:13] the power has grown Beyond a breath and
[2:07:17] a little blow
[2:07:19] and a more powerful blow to the blow of
[2:07:22] the
[2:07:23] spirit has come
[2:07:25] together oh Jesus and before long the
[2:07:30] dead will be walking Among
[2:07:34] Us
[2:07:37] Hallelujah
[2:07:39] Hallelujah Lord Jesus if there's any
[2:07:41] here tonight that's
[2:07:43] dead in sin I
[2:07:46] mean May that great resurrector walk in
[2:07:49] this building
[2:07:51] father may you deal with them tonight
[2:07:53] Lord help them to realize they don't
[2:07:55] have to wait till Sunday they may not be
[2:07:57] alive but Sunday
[2:07:59] morning help them to realize tonight
[2:08:01] they can commit their heart to you if
[2:08:04] there's one that needs the Holy Ghost if
[2:08:06] there's some that's just the battles and
[2:08:08] things of life just wearing them out
[2:08:10] Lord that's what Daniel said Satan would
[2:08:12] do in the last day he would just try to
[2:08:15] wear out the patience of the Saints
[2:08:19] may you move among us tonight
[2:08:21] God may you Minister strength and
[2:08:24] healing and virtue Lord Jesus to your
[2:08:28] little bride we need it oh God I need it
[2:08:33] father like never before I need your
[2:08:37] strength I need your
[2:08:39] wisdom oh God to lead this portion of
[2:08:43] people that you've committed to my
[2:08:46] charge father we need need you Lord
[2:08:50] Jesus Oh come by this way tonight father
[2:08:54] we call upon your name oh Lord we need
[2:08:58] your
[2:08:59] help we need your strengths your
[2:09:04] courage
[2:09:06] hallelujah oh we worship you
[2:09:09] Jesus we worship you
[2:09:12] father I glorify your
[2:09:16] name I Praise You Now Lord
[2:09:19] God thank you
[2:09:22] Jesus anybody want to just enter in with
[2:09:26] me now remember you've got the Holy
[2:09:30] Ghost you've got that original
[2:09:34] fire God will accept your
[2:09:37] worship it's coming from the same fire
[2:09:41] that Peter
[2:09:42] worshiped it's not strange wasn't lit
[2:09:45] from this man's idea or this man's
[2:09:47] opinion but it come from the same altar
[2:09:51] the same fire of God so wherever the
[2:09:54] fire is present that means the
[2:09:57] worshippers can
[2:09:59] worship your worship will be received
[2:10:02] because the fire was taken from the
[2:10:05] altar where the sacrifice was given and
[2:10:09] when they would burn the incense as it
[2:10:11] was later dictated by the prophet they
[2:10:13] would take the fire from the altar of
[2:10:16] the
[2:10:17] sacrifice and they would then light the
[2:10:19] incense that come from the altar of
[2:10:22] sacrifice so their praise could only be
[2:10:25] received as long as it was offered from
[2:10:28] the sacrificial altar so our praise
[2:10:31] don't come because of emotion and
[2:10:33] because of beautiful music it comes
[2:10:36] because our soul has been cleansed by
[2:10:39] the blood of the
[2:10:40] Lamb so we worship and we praise
[2:10:44] Hallelujah don't you understand what
[2:10:46] your praise is it's an extension of his
[2:10:51] sacrifice so he give gave himself for
[2:10:54] you then his life in you motivates you
[2:10:58] to praise and worship and thank him I'll
[2:11:03] tell you children one of your quickest
[2:11:05] ways down to defeat is to give up your
[2:11:08] praise when Satan gets your praise he's
[2:11:12] just about got you whipped don't you
[2:11:15] never don't you never let him take your
[2:11:19] praise Carol told me the other day you
[2:11:22] can imagine we're all still struggling
[2:11:24] of course with Erica's past and I know
[2:11:26] many of you are I know you are you loved
[2:11:28] her and you prayed for her I'm hearing
[2:11:29] from people around the world their
[2:11:31] hearts are just still brokenhearted
[2:11:34] Carol told me the other day she said
[2:11:36] I'll tell you Donnie I asked her I said
[2:11:38] how you doing honey she said some days I
[2:11:40] just cry all day some days I do better
[2:11:43] she said but there's one thing I've
[2:11:45] learned I've learned to praise him and
[2:11:48] she said even when I I I I'm crying I
[2:11:51] don't know what else to say I'm praising
[2:11:53] him I'm thanking him for taking her I'm
[2:11:56] thinking him she's not sick no
[2:11:58] more we thought God was going to heal
[2:12:01] her didn't you sure that's what most of
[2:12:03] us thought well he did just not the way
[2:12:07] we thought come on she wasn't just
[2:12:10] healed of her body she was healed of her
[2:12:14] mortality she'll never get sick again
[2:12:18] she has embraced the fullness of her
[2:12:22] healing if he would have healed her of
[2:12:24] cancer no doubt she would have got sick
[2:12:26] again brother R said people would he
[2:12:28] said if you get sick to heal tonight you
[2:12:31] will probably get sick again where she's
[2:12:33] at she'll never get sick again brother
[2:12:37] Jean Littleton blessed his heart he got
[2:12:39] so sick and suffering it's never
[2:12:41] happened again oh my goodness bless his
[2:12:45] heart the last couple of days before
[2:12:47] he's passing reaching out for sister
[2:12:49] Helen glory to God he ain't reaching out
[2:12:52] for her no more I imagine they met down
[2:12:55] at the river him and all the rest of the
[2:12:57] Saints here come my little blond-headed
[2:12:59] daughter down there screaming he's
[2:13:02] arrived he's arrived brother Jean how
[2:13:05] are you how are you praise be to God
[2:13:08] that ain't an old man's dream that's
[2:13:11] God's word brother
[2:13:13] sister that's the way we want to be
[2:13:15] don't
[2:13:16] we oh
[2:13:19] hallelujah
[2:13:21] hallelujah let's just worship Him can we
[2:13:25] now from the alter of our heart which
[2:13:27] has been purged by the blood of the
[2:13:29] sacrifice set on fire by the pillar of
[2:13:33] fire now our praise can come
[2:13:36] forth
[2:13:38] oh you don't know how it feels unless
[2:13:40] you were in
[2:13:42] Pentecost to use your gift and you feel
[2:13:45] like you prostituted it in the old tent
[2:13:49] days Harry brother Larry some of these
[2:13:52] brothers that played in Pentecost and
[2:13:54] you feel like that you took your gift
[2:13:56] and your talent and it was used to stir
[2:13:59] people and their emotions and get them
[2:14:01] all fired up if you ain't never done
[2:14:03] that it's very hard to describe what you
[2:14:06] feel
[2:14:08] like and you still have an element of
[2:14:11] restriction when you come to the word of
[2:14:13] the hour because you're so afraid that
[2:14:15] you lead people back into that again
[2:14:18] by your
[2:14:19] gift oh but when you know the altar has
[2:14:22] been purged and you know the spirit of
[2:14:25] God can anoint
[2:14:27] you then you can offer your gift and
[2:14:30] your talents and you know it's coming
[2:14:33] from a heart which has been purged it's
[2:14:37] coming from a life that has been lit not
[2:14:40] by
[2:14:41] 1906 but by the original fire that fell
[2:14:44] on the day of
[2:14:46] Pentecost I hope you understand what I'm
[2:14:48] saying tonight the same wind that blowed
[2:14:51] in the upper room is right here in this
[2:14:53] church
[2:14:55] tonight it ain't a little breeze it's
[2:14:58] the same Mighty rushing wind we need
[2:15:01] more than a little breath friends we
[2:15:04] need more than a little stir God knows
[2:15:06] if there's ever an age that needed this
[2:15:09] power it's us we can't make it
[2:15:12] intellectually we can make it on our
[2:15:14] mind we've got to have the Holy Ghost
[2:15:17] amen and it's
[2:15:18] power don't you love him can we just
[2:15:22] turn and lay hands on one another if you
[2:15:24] would I want you to just pray for the

[2:16:04] you to pray over the people if you

[2:16:14] Pentecost but I needed more and I
[2:16:17] couldn't get it till I come to the word
