[34:24] escalated till I was
[34:25] hospitalized and they found out out it
[34:28] was a rare form of
[34:29] sasis and it only
[34:32] happens in random cases uh Mayo Clinic
[34:37] has treated two cases of it and the rest
[34:40] the doctor said it most doctors had
[34:42] never seen it on a human it was only in
[34:45] textbooks that they had saw it so God
[34:48] brought me through that but in the
[34:50] meantime I was uh began to swell in my
[34:54] abdomen and they had uh the doctors had
[34:57] done
[34:58] MRI and they determined I had therosis
[35:00] but I had to go in for a parenthesis and
[35:03] they had taken actually nine and a half
[35:06] 2 lers of fluid from me so I went on for
[35:09] a little while the fluid began to gather
[35:12] again and usually when this happens
[35:14] you're not too far from the end is what
[35:16] they say sometimes so but I was trusting
[35:19] God so I go back again they take 8 and
[35:22] 1/2 2 L again then my right lung filled
[35:26] and they took a one L
[35:28] of fluid out of my right lung I sat and
[35:30] watched them draw it out into something
[35:33] like a coke
[35:34] bottle I was uh 6 years old and we had a
[35:39] chance to go to brother braham's
[35:40] meetings in Chicago Ohio in
[35:42] 1960 and we we were there for five
[35:45] nights and two things that I remembered
[35:48] we were in a Pentecostal Church growing
[35:51] up there was a lady that they requested
[35:54] prayer for her name was Polly Reed and
[35:57] she she was in Middletown Ohio and
[35:59] you'll hear it on the tape it is I Be
[36:02] not Afraid we our family was setting two
[36:05] rows of seats from her when brother bam
[36:08] called her out he said that light was
[36:10] circling over there it landed first on a
[36:14] lady beside of her then it moved over to
[36:16] her and he told her he said you have a
[36:19] hole in your heart and you're going to
[36:21] die well we had just heard that
[36:23] testimony about 3 weeks before that in
[36:25] our hometown Church in Virginia never
[36:29] did we believe that we would see that
[36:31] lady so she was healed
[36:34] immediately I'm giving you this
[36:35] background to to try to encourage you
[36:38] with faith uh on the night he preached
[36:42] the reject the king there was a lady
[36:44] laying across from me on a stretcher and
[36:47] she looked like the great niece of
[36:49] Florence Nightingale she was Skin and
[36:51] Bones she's able to barely raise her
[36:53] hand up off the
[36:55] cot brother R's getting ready to leave
[36:57] the platform and he turned back and
[36:59] looked in our Direction he said what was
[37:01] that past me he said that wasn't an uler
[37:04] he said that was a cancer devil well he
[37:06] immediately prayed for her and I saw her
[37:09] with my own eyes get up off that cot and
[37:11] Shout to the glory of God I whispered to
[37:15] my mother I said how is she standing on
[37:16] those legs or nothing but broomsticks
[37:19] but she
[37:20] did that was a platform for for the
[37:23] faith that I I got when this when I got
[37:26] this diagnosis
[37:28] so I go to the doctor and they say well
[37:30] you got the therosis you got a 10 cm
[37:33] Mass it's possibly cancer first wanted
[37:36] to do
[37:36] surgery maybe a transplant then they
[37:39] come back and said you don't qualify for
[37:41] either so I said you you giv me no hope
[37:44] medically they said no I said well I've
[37:47] got a high
[37:48] power that has the final answer so I
[37:51] would not take any drugs any
[37:54] chemo uh they they actually got mad at
[37:57] me because I wouldn't go the route they
[37:59] wanted me to go but seeing this from my
[38:02] childhood I knew God was the same
[38:04] yesterday today and forever and I have
[38:07] testified that to many of these brothers
[38:09] they can tell you that I've said that
[38:12] after saying this as a young boy that
[38:14] God was the same and he still is I don't
[38:16] care what you're going through what
[38:18] you've been diagnosed with you don't
[38:21] have fear and you get up every day and
[38:23] you testify you thank God for healing
[38:26] you that's what I did and I'm still
[38:29] standing here today they did a MRI and a
[38:34] again about a year ago the doctor three
[38:37] months ago said well you know you've got
[38:39] cancer don't you I said well that's what
[38:42] they say I never have said I have this
[38:46] or I don't have it I said they say I
[38:49] have it but I'm not testifying to that
[38:52] so they don't you know they couldn't
[38:53] couldn't hardly grasp that so but anyway
[38:56] uh I was uh recovering doing better and
[39:01] I was on a platform on Wednesday night
[39:03] playing the
[39:04] guitar but I still very weak in my body
[39:06] I was hardly able to walk brother Daryl
[39:09] had prayed for his last person
[39:12] here and uh I I wanted to get up and go
[39:15] down but I was too weak I didn't think I
[39:18] could get back up if I did so I said God
[39:22] I saw this as a
[39:23] child I said
[39:28] I don't have to go to him you can send
[39:30] him to me that was the very words I said
[39:33] in my heart he prayed for the last
[39:35] person I was sitting here in the old
[39:39] church he put his coat across his arm he
[39:42] walked toward me and he turned around
[39:45] looked at me like he had never seen me
[39:47] before he walked straight to
[39:49] me and started praying for me from that
[39:52] time on my health started turning and by
[39:57] the grace of God I'm standing here today
[39:59] and can give you this testimony no
[40:01] matter what the devil tells you don't
[40:03] accept it it's it's not the final answer
[40:08] he's a
[40:09] blood
[40:11] and go go about your life brother BR
[40:14] said go about your life and don't fear I
[40:17] had no fear I can honestly say with my
[40:19] hand over my heart when they told me the
[40:22] diagnosis I walked through the valley of
[40:24] the shadow of death but I had no fear
[40:27] because I knew if he he took care of me
[40:29] all the rest of my life he could do it
[40:31] this time that's right so brothers and
[40:33] sisters no matter what he tells you
[40:34] don't fear it brother Ram said do not
[40:37] fear it and you go about your life and
[40:39] you sing and you give God praise and you
[40:42] thank him every day for what he's done
[40:44] and you will see the results God bless
[40:47] you
[40:58] I think brother Bobby could say that he
[40:59] doesn't regret one mile that he's
[41:01] traveled for the Lord and that right
[41:03] there is why because if he didn't
[41:05] believe in him he could have left him
[41:06] there to die but instead he healed him
[41:08] and there he is amen let's sing this old
[41:11] song I don't
[41:14] regret one
[41:17] mile I've
[41:19] traveled for the
[41:24] Lord and I don't re ret one

[42:28] his
[42:30] word I've seen the years go
[42:37] by many days without a
[42:43] song but I don't regret one

[43:55] brother Jackie
[43:58] seemed like I was uh well I was just a a
[44:02] young boy and
[44:03] the Lord spoke to me down on the river
[44:06] that day and told me to
[44:10] preach then he spoke to me told me when
[44:13] I turned 30 I'd start traveling and so
[44:17] when I turned 30 I got an invitation
[44:19] down into South Carolina and that kind
[44:21] of got me traveling and then I traveled
[44:24] for years and worked 40 hours a week and
[44:28] I come home sometimes 3 4:00 in the
[44:30] morning and sat in the chair for a
[44:32] little bit and throw water in my face
[44:34] and go to
[44:35] work then in June of 2000 I was coming
[44:38] back from lunch going back to surgery
[44:41] come around the corner of a hallway
[44:43] there at the VA hospital and just walked
[44:47] right into the presence of the Lord he
[44:48] was just hanging there and I just begin
[44:50] to
[44:51] weep a voice spoke to me and said go
[44:54] preach my word
[44:57] so in 2000 I went fulltime and 24 years
[45:01] later I don't regret a mile that I've
[45:03] traveled for the
[45:05] Lord amen he's he's been so good for all
[45:09] of
[45:11] us and that's what we want to look at
[45:13] tonight is to know that none of us are
[45:14] here by accident but there's a purpose
[45:17] for all of us if you have your Bibles
[45:19] turn with us tonight to the book of
[45:21] Ephesians want to read from Ephesians
[45:22] chapter 3 verse 11 and brother Justin
[45:26] talking about 911 as we remember that
[45:28] that day and he was right he was at our
[45:30] house was having a little birthday party
[45:32] for Carissa and Allison uh the day that
[45:35] that happened and I guess everybody
[45:37] remembers where they was at when they
[45:39] got news of that that terrible day
[45:42] but
[45:44] amen Ephesians 3 we just want to read
[45:47] one verse there of verse 11 trust
[45:49] something to be said tonight to help you
[45:50] to encourage you that's truly the reason
[45:53] that we came and I don't uh know all
[45:57] that everybody here is facing or what
[45:59] you're going through with individually
[46:00] and how many needs would be here tonight
[46:02] but there's one thing that I do know is
[46:04] that there's not a need in the building
[46:06] that's greater than our
[46:08] God there's not one diagnosis that
[46:10] you've got that God wasn't aware of
[46:13] didn't take God by surprise it might
[46:15] have shocked you but not God he knew all
[46:17] about it can you believe that tonight
[46:19] he's got it all in
[46:21] control I said he's got it all in
[46:24] control Ephesians 3:11 the the Bible
[46:27] says this according to the Eternal
[46:30] purpose which he purposed in Christ
[46:33] Jesus our lord now Eternal means without
[46:37] beginning and end that which always has
[46:42] been and always will be without
[46:46] beginning Without End never to
[46:50] cease Eternal may the Lord add the
[46:53] blessing to the reading of his word
[46:54] let's bow our heads I want to speak to
[46:56] you tonight on God God's undefeatable
[46:59] Eternal
[47:01] purpose God's undefeatable Eternal
[47:05] purpose or if I could take a context out
[47:08] of that I'd like to say the man who
[47:10] wrote the book says I'm one of
[47:14] them Heavenly
[47:17] Father we thank you for your word Lord
[47:19] and we thank you for the opportunity to
[47:21] stand before your people we surrender
[47:23] this congregation and oursel into your
[47:25] hands For Your Glory may you come
[47:27] tonight Lord and speak Words of Life to
[47:29] our hearts and Lord may we not just be
[47:31] hearers of the word as James said but
[47:33] may we be doers of that which we've
[47:34] heard may we accept it believe it and
[47:37] confess it for we know that is the ABCs
[47:40] of our healing that is the ABCs of our
[47:42] walk dear God is to believe what you
[47:44] said in your word about us we commit
[47:48] these things into your hands For Your
[47:49] Glory in Jesus name and the bride says
[47:53] amen God bless you may be S seated
[47:57] thank you
[47:59] buddy now I want to
[48:01] draw this first into your
[48:04] mind that there's not one thing that can
[48:07] destroy us until the purpose of he who
[48:11] created us has been fulfilled there
[48:15] could be nothing that could destroy us
[48:18] not one thing until the purpose of he
[48:20] who created us has been fulfilled there
[48:24] could be nothing the prophet said so
[48:27] then we come to understand this evening
[48:28] that we are made for a purpose you see
[48:32] this church here T night that we're in
[48:33] and we thank God for it it's such a such
[48:35] a beautiful building but this Foundation
[48:37] that was dug this building the roof and
[48:39] the interior and that was put in it was
[48:41] not just done all this wasn't just done
[48:43] to see if it could be done it was put
[48:47] here for a purpose your home that you
[48:50] was in before you come to church tonight
[48:52] was not just accidentally put there for
[48:55] somebody just wasting time where well
[48:57] we'll just see if we can build this no
[48:58] your home was made for a purpose your
[49:02] home was made to serve a purpose the
[49:04] automobile you drove here tonight was
[49:06] not made just to see if it could be made
[49:08] the material was not wasted by man it
[49:11] was made for a purpose to serve a
[49:13] purpose the clothing that you wear
[49:15] tonight was not just to see if somebody
[49:18] could design or fashion a piece of
[49:20] clothing no it was put for a purpose the
[49:23] food that you eat was not grown on the
[49:25] earth just to see if it could be grown
[49:27] but the food that we eat was grown to
[49:30] serve a
[49:31] purpose amen and God just not uh just
[49:34] didn't just happen to be making a tree
[49:36] just to be making a tree but he made a
[49:39] tree for a purpose and I want to say
[49:42] tonight that God made
[49:43] you not just to see if he could do it
[49:47] but God Made You for a
[49:51] purpose amen therefore there is a
[49:54] purpose for all of us being here we're
[49:56] not here here just to be another human
[49:58] being but we are here because God made
[50:01] you for some purpose we W just put here
[50:05] to eat the food that God grow we're not
[50:06] just put here to live in a house that
[50:08] some man made or or to drive an
[50:10] automobile that somebody created or wear
[50:12] clothes that somebody fashion but we are
[50:14] here for a specific
[50:16] purpose the trees God didn't have to
[50:18] make trees the way he made them but he
[50:20] made the trees for a purpose though
[50:23] they're different from one another yet
[50:24] he made each tree for a purpose purpose
[50:27] he could have make trees any way he
[50:28] wanted to make them he could have made
[50:30] flowers any way he wanted to make
[50:32] flowers but he made all of them the
[50:34] trees and the flowers everything he made
[50:37] for a
[50:38] purpose and what was that purpose to
[50:40] give a witness to give a
[50:44] testimony oh think about that he just
[50:46] didn't make a tree to be making it but
[50:48] he made a tree for a purpose that it
[50:50] would be a witness that it could give a
[50:53] testimony some people well that's just a
[50:55] tree but to God it's a witness it's a
[50:58] testimony he made them to Bear witness
[51:01] for they are God's Witnesses they are a
[51:04] true witness that all other religions is
[51:07] false and Jesus Christ is
[51:11] right the very trees that God placed
[51:13] upon the Earth will condemn some of
[51:15] these false religions for the trees the
[51:19] that God himself created serve a purpose
[51:21] to give a witness that Jesus Christ is
[51:25] right
[51:27] the death burial and Resurrection gives
[51:29] a witness that we are not dead eternally
[51:32] but we shall live again
[51:34] amen it shows a supreme intelligence
[51:38] look at the sun the prophet said when it
[51:40] comes out in the morning what's what
[51:41] happens to the sun it's a little baby
[51:43] born in the East about 10:00 it's a
[51:46] teenager at noon time it's in its
[51:49] strength in the evening time it's middle
[51:52] aged and at the evening time it's gone
[51:55] it's set it's finished but is that all
[51:58] there is of the
[52:00] sun no God's got a purpose for the Sun
[52:04] so the Sun comes back and rises
[52:07] again what does it what does it speak of
[52:10] it speaks of a birth a life a death and
[52:13] a
[52:14] resurrection Hallelujah it goes to show
[52:17] that it was made by a supreme
[52:20] intelligence to serve a purpose it's
[52:23] here for a purpose and I say tonight if
[52:25] that's true for for a flower if that's
[52:27] true for a tree if that's true for the
[52:31] sun then what about
[52:35] you what about you do you think we just
[52:38] accidentally fell into this thing you
[52:40] think God just accidentally created us I
[52:42] tell you no as the tree has a purpose
[52:45] and the flower has a purpose and the sun
[52:47] has a purpose to give a witness to be a
[52:49] testimony God has created
[52:51] you Hallelujah to be a
[52:55] witness no matter how little you are how
[52:57] big you are how important you are how
[52:59] unimportant you are you're here to serve
[53:03] a purpose it don't matter how old you
[53:04] are how young you are every person here
[53:07] was here for a purpose to serve a
[53:10] purpose just as my finger is here for a
[53:12] purpose and the nail on my finger is
[53:13] here for a purpose my eye and every part
[53:16] of my body is here for a purpose sure
[53:18] this little finger maybe not look as
[53:20] much as the as the bless of my eye but
[53:22] it's still a part of my body and it
[53:24] serves a purpose and I need that nail on
[53:26] the little
[53:28] finger come on somebody well I'm not the
[53:31] eye I'm not the tongue I'm not the ear
[53:33] but I don't care if I'm just a little
[53:35] toe on the foot the last toe where that
[53:38] little crease touches the foot if that's
[53:39] who I am in the body I still am here to
[53:42] serve a
[53:44] purpose
[53:46] hallelujah amen my eye every part of my
[53:49] body is here to serve for purpose it was
[53:51] not put here just to see what it would
[53:53] look like when it was put here but it
[53:55] was put here to serve its purpose it was
[53:58] God's divine plan to do
[54:02] so and if we were put here for a purpose
[54:05] then there's nothing nothing that can
[54:08] destroy us till God's purpose is
[54:12] fulfilled I make a Baptist shout I said
[54:16] there is nothing that can harm us until
[54:19] the purpose that God has put us here has
[54:21] been made manifest no matter how much
[54:23] trouble we have how much heartache we
[54:25] have how sorrow that we go through all
[54:28] these things are for a reason God is not
[54:30] the author of confusion and everything
[54:33] that happens in our life God has a
[54:35] purpose for allowing it to happen amen
[54:38] and no matter what we Face the sorrow
[54:39] the pain the disappointment the sickness
[54:41] the fear all the things that we face as
[54:43] human beings has not been put here to
[54:45] destroy us because our purpose
[54:48] Hallelujah cannot be defeated by the
[54:50] things we
[54:52] suffer
[54:55] Hallelujah Hallelujah no matter how much
[54:57] heartache no matter how much sorrow all
[55:00] these things are a reason there's a
[55:01] reason for it but nothing you face in
[55:04] life will defeat the purpose that God
[55:07] has brought for your life it's the
[55:09] undefeatable Eternal purpose of the
[55:12] almighty
[55:14] God oh Hallelujah God placed you here
[55:18] you didn't stagger into this thing he
[55:20] could have put us in Luther's day
[55:21] Wesley's day he could put us in the days
[55:22] of Paul he could put us in the days of
[55:24] Jesus we could have been one of the
[55:26] discipl I Les but he chose this age this
[55:28] time this season this place to place you
[55:31] here it was not by accident but God knew
[55:33] in the last day in this age of confusion
[55:35] and lies and all the distress and all
[55:37] the darkness he knew he could put you
[55:39] here because he knew you would believe
[55:40] him when he spoke
[55:42] amen hallelujah Nations a lie to you
[55:45] governments a lie to you family a lie to
[55:47] you come on somebody but the word of God
[55:49] will never lie to us hallelujah and he
[55:52] knew he could have you here he could
[55:54] place you here and against all and
[55:56] against all darkness and against all
[55:58] confusion and against all denominations
[56:00] and against all internets somebody would

[57:19] few minutes in your mind before there
[57:21] was ever an angel a star a planet there
[57:23] was no air there was no life there was
[57:25] no stars there was no World there was
[57:27] nothing else it was God and God Alone
[57:29] Ella Ella Elohim which means the
[57:31] self-existing one there was nothing else
[57:34] existed but him and the self-existing
[57:36] one that we call God but before there
[57:38] was ever anything to worship him he was
[57:40] just a self-existing one and the
[57:43] self-existing one had a desire he had a
[57:46] purpose something that he wanted to
[57:47] achieve and he purposed within himself
[57:50] that he would do this thing and he spoke
[57:53] let there be light and there was like
[57:56] why he purposed it and the Darkness
[57:58] could not stop the light from coming
[58:01] forth because God's purpose can never be
[58:04] defeated
[58:08] amen hallelujah no matter how mysterious
[58:11] it may seem to be God always keeps his
[58:14] word God keeps his word if God makes a
[58:16] promise of anything God will keep that
[58:21] promise you and I make promises we
[58:23] intend to keep but things happen that we
[58:25] have to to break a
[58:27] promise but not
[58:30] God oh no he knows all the future from
[58:33] the beginning he don't make a promise
[58:35] unless he knows what's going to happen
[58:37] and he always keeps his promise God
[58:41] Don't Make A Promise unless he knows
[58:44] it's going to unless he knows he's going
[58:47] to keep it unless he knows what's going
[58:48] to happen Hallelujah he will not make a
[58:51] promise unless he knows he's going to
[58:54] keep it
[58:57] other words God just don't say something
[58:58] to be sa if God says something he means
[59:00] it and if God says he'll do something
[59:02] he'll bankrupt all Heaven before he'll
[59:04] let that promise fail
[59:07] you God purposed within himself to prove
[59:10] his word he said I will prove my word to
[59:12] be the truth listen to me I don't
[59:15] believe God heals people just to show
[59:16] his power to heal that's not why God
[59:19] heals he heals to fulfill his word for
[59:23] the word says He Is A Healer
[59:27] amen he shows he fulfills his word he
[59:29] keeps his promise when he came here on
[59:31] the earth the first time he said that he
[59:33] did this that it might be fulfilled
[59:35] which was spoken by the prophets listen
[59:38] to me all God's word must be

[1:00:44] no death no perils nor nothing that can
[1:00:46] separate us from the purpose of the
[1:00:48] Living God what God has imagined in his
[1:00:51] mind what God has purposed in his heart
[1:00:53] to bring the past there is no demon
[1:00:56] there is no power there is nothing that
[1:00:59] can ever separate God's Immortal Eternal
[1:01:02] plan it must be as God has
[1:01:08] said
[1:01:12] Hallelujah God said let a virgin
[1:01:15] conceive and bring forth a child and it
[1:01:18] was as God
[1:01:23] said God said behold i s you Elijah
[1:01:26] before the coming of the great and
[1:01:28] Dreadful day of the Lord and it was as
[1:01:31] God said that's right God said there'll
[1:01:34] be a bride she'll be bone of my bone
[1:01:37] Flesh of My Flesh Spirit of my spirit
[1:01:39] and she
[1:01:42] is she is him and it is as God has
[1:01:50] said there will be a bride brother I
[1:01:53] reckon when she'll come
[1:01:56] she's
[1:01:57] here brother Bon said in 64 he said the
[1:02:00] bride is born in infancy the word is
[1:02:03] come forth through the end time friends
[1:02:05] we're at the end time in' 64 it was a
[1:02:07] bride in infancy but what's happened
[1:02:09] between 60 64 and 2024 the bride has
[1:02:13] come to maturity she's reached the age
[1:02:15] of love She's reached the season she can
[1:02:17] reproduce him again on the
[1:02:21] earth
[1:02:23] Hallelujah think of it the heavenly
[1:02:26] father do you think for one minute that
[1:02:30] the heavenly father will be defeated in
[1:02:31] his purpose even though Satan has done
[1:02:34] what he's done it's an impossibility he
[1:02:36] will not be defeated and he's given us
[1:02:39] perfect
[1:02:40] assurance that we will not have to be
[1:02:42] scared of
[1:02:44] anything amen what the father has
[1:02:47] purposed in your life can never be
[1:02:53] defeated the undefeatable eternal
[1:02:56] purpose of God for your
[1:03:04] life think about that you see what do
[1:03:07] you mean well think of David David was
[1:03:09] anointed by the great prophet Samuel to
[1:03:11] be king and between the ages of 10 and
[1:03:14] 15 year old who was 9' N9 in tall and
[1:03:19] saw the king that David no doubt looked
[1:03:21] up to he tells David you're just a youth
[1:03:23] you're too young you can't do it
[1:03:26] and Goliath has been a Warrior from his
[1:03:28] Youth and you're still a youth but the
[1:03:31] giant that stood before David did not
[1:03:33] see the God who was with
[1:03:35] David Hallelujah if he did he would have
[1:03:38] turned from the battle
[1:03:40] amen but God done said to David you will
[1:03:43] reign as king it came through a
[1:03:45] prophet's
[1:03:49] message God sent a prophet to tell David
[1:03:52] what his future was
[1:03:56] he might have preached future home to
[1:03:58] him come on somebody God sent a prophet
[1:04:01] to tell David not only what was
[1:04:03] happening right now but things that are
[1:04:05] to
[1:04:10] be and God told David through a prophet
[1:04:13] you will reign his
[1:04:14] King now how can he die by a giant as a
[1:04:19] boy and reign as king so David took God
[1:04:23] at his word and as far as the word was
[1:04:25] was concerned Goliath was defeated
[1:04:29] before the battle ever
[1:04:35] started because God's purpose for
[1:04:37] David's life could not be defeated by a
[1:04:41] giant and the giant that tries to R over
[1:04:44] your
[1:04:45] life cannot defeat God's purpose for
[1:04:49] your life amen you said brother darl
[1:04:51] I've got a giant raining in my life
[1:04:52] right now I've got this mountain as a
[1:04:54] boy told me Sunday down when he come up
[1:04:56] for gra me want me to pray for him he
[1:04:58] said I've got this mountain that needs
[1:04:59] to be moved but let me tell you no
[1:05:01] mountain can stand in the way of God's
[1:05:03] purpose for your life amen no jant no
[1:05:06] trial no habit no sickness no disease
[1:05:08] come on somebody there is nothing n o t
[1:05:11] h n nothing that can defeat God's
[1:05:14] purpose for our life it'll be as God has
[1:05:16] said it will be Shad M shako Flo into a
[1:05:19] furnace heated up seven times hotter
[1:05:21] than it ever been heated before and we
[1:05:23] said they said whether God would deliver
[1:05:25] us this we do not know but there's one
[1:05:27] thing we do know he is more than able to
[1:05:29] deliver
[1:05:33] us he's able to deliver us but
[1:05:36] nonetheless we will not bow to this
[1:05:40] image and the prophet said God had
[1:05:42] someone who would serve him and his
[1:05:45] purpose would not be defeated fire
[1:05:50] cannot defeat the purpose of God's plan
[1:05:54] and the prophet said how we left the say
[1:05:55] this morning all the hydrogen bombs in
[1:05:58] the world can never defeat the
[1:06:01] resurrection of his
[1:06:03] church well brother Daryl you reckon
[1:06:05] Putin I don't care what Putin's going to
[1:06:07] do he ain't going to do nothing but what
[1:06:09] God allow him to
[1:06:10] do amen and if they push one button
[1:06:14] we'll be gone before it ever strikes the
[1:06:16] United States
[1:06:21] yeah all the bombs they have all the
[1:06:24] threats they have the imminent oh my yo
[1:06:26] everybody's looking for a donkey they're
[1:06:28] looking for Harris or they're looking
[1:06:30] for Trump to save this nation they
[1:06:31] believe in a donkey tell you this nation
[1:06:34] don't need a donkey nor an elephant it
[1:06:36] needs a
[1:06:40] lamb they rejected the thing that they
[1:06:43] [Applause]
[1:06:46] needed all the bombs in the world can
[1:06:49] never defeat the resurrection of his
[1:06:50] church all the explaining the way all
[1:06:53] the mathematics so forth the
[1:06:54] intelligence of the world has disguised
[1:06:56] the purpose to do something about to
[1:06:58] destroy the faith of God's children
[1:07:00] don't you understand they'll never
[1:07:01] crucify him again but the prophet said
[1:07:03] what is the third crucifixion brother
[1:07:05] Jackie the crucifying the effects of the
[1:07:07] word that can never nail him to a tree
[1:07:09] again that's been done one time but what
[1:07:11] they they do now through the websites
[1:07:13] through the books come on somebody they
[1:07:14] try to take the word of God and make it
[1:07:16] no effect in your
[1:07:19] life amen come on somebody but the Bible
[1:07:22] said Faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[1:07:25] by the the word of God so what did they
[1:07:27] do they tried to explain it away by
[1:07:28] their intelligence they try to explain
[1:07:30] it away by their mathematics something
[1:07:32] trying to destroy the faith of God's
[1:07:34] children all this believe the sign trash
[1:07:36] all these books that they buy on Amazon
[1:07:38] it's a bunch of nonsense I said it's a
[1:07:40] bunch of
[1:07:42] nonsense you think I'm going to believe
[1:07:44] somebody that wrote a book that can't do
[1:07:45] one miracle that don't know God from a
[1:07:47] hot and to come on somebody I serve the
[1:07:49] Living God tonight and he promised to
[1:07:51] send Elijah the prophet and he kept his
[1:07:53] word and he sent that prophet to me and
[1:07:56] he opened the seals and he revealed to
[1:07:58] me my purpose for being on the earth
[1:08:00] amen there is no book from Amazon going
[1:08:03] to take that away from
[1:08:09] me Hallelujah the prophet said they'll
[1:08:12] never do it that faith that faith will
[1:08:16] live on
[1:08:22] forever Moses when he talking and all
[1:08:25] the wisdom of the Egyptians when he knew
[1:08:28] that God had a purpose for his life what
[1:08:32] did that Revelation come from his
[1:08:36] mother said she was the Fifth
[1:08:40] Gospel it was Joseph his mother who took
[1:08:44] Moses and shoved him right out into the
[1:08:47] jaws of death what did she take him to
[1:08:50] what were they doing with these Hebrew
[1:08:51] children they was throwing them into the
[1:08:53] river they was feeding them to the
[1:08:54] crocodiles and and what did yed
[1:08:57] do she knew that God delivered Noah by
[1:09:00] an ark so she built an ark for her baby
[1:09:02] and what did she do she pushed it right
[1:09:04] out there in the now where all the
[1:09:06] crocodiles was she pushed it right out
[1:09:08] into the jaws of death why would she do
[1:09:10] that because she knew God's purpose
[1:09:12] could not be defeated
[1:09:16] amen there wasn't enough water in an
[1:09:18] aisle to drown him there wasn't enough
[1:09:20] crocodiles in all the world that could
[1:09:21] swallow him he was God's chosen and he
[1:09:24] was God's chosen for that purpose and
[1:09:26] nobody could take his

[1:10:05] desert out there the the screams and the
[1:10:07] HTS and the Wilderness stagging around

[1:10:12] nothing could defeat God's purpose huh
[1:10:16] for God had placed him there God had put
[1:10:18] Moses there to do what God told him to
[1:10:20] do cuz his purpose cannot be defeated

[1:32:25] power nor things present nor things to
[1:32:27] come nor hyp nor death nor any other
[1:32:30] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:32:34] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:32:36] Jesus our
[1:32:39] lord then what should we be we are
[1:32:42] children of the promise being dead in
[1:32:44] Christ we are Abraham's seed and our HS
[1:32:47] with him with the promise no matter how
[1:32:50] much sickness comes what kind of death
[1:32:53] we die how much poverty we go through
[1:32:55] God's purpose cannot be defeated he will
[1:32:59] raise us up again for he said because I
[1:33:06] live ye shall live
[1:33:10] also the author of this book said no
[1:33:14] weapon that is formed against thee shall
[1:33:17] prosper and every tongue that shall rise
[1:33:19] against thee in judgment Thou shalt
[1:33:22] condemn this is the her of the Servants
[1:33:24] of the Lord and the righteousness is of
