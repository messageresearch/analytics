[27:59] that i've had lord i've looked at him
[28:01] i've looked at the scriptures looked at
[28:02] quotes lord but when
[28:03] you walk out of here sometimes lord it
[28:05] just seems to wash all the way
[28:07] you can't think of anything to say lord
[28:11] but lord if you have control if you come
[28:14] and take over father i won't have to
[28:15] worry about that
[28:17] so i pray that you would come bless us
[28:18] tonight bless us with your presence
[28:20] bless everyone that's gathered everyone
[28:22] that's streaming lord you know the lives
[28:24] the needs of each one lord
[28:25] we welcome you here tonight we thank you
[28:27] in jesus name amen
[28:30] if you have your bibles we're going to
[28:33] open with the scripture
[28:34] colossians 3 i'll read verses 5 through
[28:38] 10.
[28:39] i tell brother bradley a while ago
[28:41] somebody asked me if
[28:44] i will be nervous i was preaching only
[28:46] about 10 people here i told them i
[28:48] preached to three one time and one of
[28:49] them stared out the window the entire
[28:51] service
[28:52] so this is a crowd
[28:55] so if you have your bibles colossians 3
[28:59] 5 and 10 mortify therefore your members
[29:02] which are upon the earth
[29:04] fornication uncleanliness an ordinance
[29:07] affection evil
[29:10] whatever that word is covetousness which
[29:13] is idolatry
[29:14] for which things say the wrath of god
[29:16] cometh out of the children of a
[29:17] disobedience
[29:19] in the which you also walk sometime when
[29:22] you lived in them
[29:23] but now you also put off these
[29:26] all these anger wrath malice blasphemy
[29:30] filthy
[29:30] communication out of your mouth lie not
[29:32] one to another
[29:34] seeing that you have put off the old man
[29:37] with his deeds seeing that you have put
[29:41] off the old man
[29:42] with his deeds and when you put on the
[29:45] new man
[29:46] which is renewed in knowledge after the
[29:48] image of him that created him
[29:50] you can be seated i have a
[29:54] my title tonight is resurrection of the
[29:56] new man
[29:58] thank you i know brother donnie's been
[30:00] speaking on this
[30:01] the last three four weeks the new man
[30:03] and the
[30:04] the seed life and i promise you i've had
[30:07] these notes since summer
[30:09] so i i haven't um i told brother jim bab
[30:12] today i'll try to
[30:13] bring it a little different
[30:16] well i promise you would be different
[30:19] you know what brother tommy brought it
[30:21] but hopefully you could we can get
[30:22] something out of it tonight
[30:24] brother branham said in 61 and why
[30:26] unless a grain of corn falls in the
[30:28] ground and rots unless a man rots to his
[30:30] own theology
[30:31] lest you rot into the methodist theology
[30:33] unless you rot into baptist theology
[30:35] unless you rot into pentecostal theology
[30:37] until you rot to those things
[30:39] and give yourself into the hands of god
[30:41] then the old man will die
[30:44] and the new man will be born christ
[30:46] jesus we will rise
[30:48] glory and the power and the resurrection
[30:50] of christ and the life that was in
[30:51] christ will be in you
[30:52] and these signs shall follow them that
[30:54] believe
[30:56] that's why the matter yes that's where
[30:58] it's at
[30:59] tonight since there's only a few people
[31:01] i mean i would
[31:03] if y'all would a man a little bit loud
[31:05] you know
[31:06] brother terry's not here no longer
[31:07] brother west so you know it really helps
[31:10] um i if y'all could just let me know
[31:13] you're out there and
[31:14] sometimes like brother donnie says i
[31:16] can't hear a nod but
[31:18] this is definitely different i will say
[31:20] this is different but i
[31:22] appreciate the the pull but paul's
[31:24] saying we have a new man
[31:26] if anybody knew that more than anybody
[31:27] paul knew that paul knew that there was
[31:30] a new man
[31:30] when he got on the road to damascus when
[31:32] jesus came and
[31:33] came to him and paul had a revelation
[31:36] paul's biggest revelation was of the old
[31:39] man
[31:40] paul hated that old man for the rest of
[31:42] his life for what he had done he
[31:43] persecuted christians
[31:45] he'd done all these things and that paul
[31:47] if you read in colossians in galatians
[31:49] and
[31:49] in corinthians different paul is talking
[31:51] about how he's crucified
[31:52] himself with christ paul he says i die
[31:54] daily all these things that paul says
[31:56] and looking back over colossians he says
[31:58] mortify therefore your members which are
[32:00] upon the earth fornication and
[32:01] cleanliness
[32:02] inordinate affection evil
[32:06] concuptuants covetness
[32:09] covetness which is idolatry mortify is
[32:13] to put to death to view as a corpse
[32:16] paul says these things that's in your
[32:18] life these things that hinder your your
[32:19] mortal body this is what i want you to
[32:21] put to death
[32:22] because long as these things live in
[32:24] your life that new man can never
[32:26] manifest himself that new man will
[32:29] always
[32:29] stay buried you know we come up here all
[32:32] the time we have we have baptisms up
[32:34] here all the time and we know it
[32:35] in symbolism it's a death burial and
[32:37] resurrection
[32:38] the old man is dies and is buried and a
[32:41] new man comes up we know that baptism
[32:43] doesn't save you within itself
[32:44] it doesn't make a new man out of you
[32:46] within itself it's all symbolism but we
[32:48] understand that
[32:48] and the scriptures instruct us to do
[32:50] that but you gotta understand
[32:53] the symbolism of that is exactly what
[32:55] paul is saying you have to kill this old
[32:57] man
[32:58] you have to kill him you know i was
[33:03] teasing with joel this this weekend you
[33:04] know we're talking about brother tim
[33:06] burdett singing that song you know the
[33:08] old man is dead
[33:10] i said you know i'm going to write a new
[33:11] one it's called the old man is on the
[33:12] ventilator
[33:14] because people don't want to kill him
[33:16] people do not want to kill him they want
[33:18] to keep him
[33:18] alive just enough if they need him
[33:23] so paul is saying and put on the new man
[33:27] which is renewed in knowledge after the
[33:28] image of him that created him
[33:30] renewed is to be changed into a new kind
[33:33] of life
[33:34] as opposed to the former corrupt state
[33:38] that's kind of similar to the word they
[33:40] use regenerate
[33:42] regen his brother brother donny says
[33:46] so paul spoke with this battle between
[33:48] this old man and this new man more than
[33:50] anybody else in the bible
[33:52] he never realized there was a new man
[33:54] until his conversion
[33:56] he thought he was the new man paul
[33:58] thought that whenever he was going
[34:00] through
[34:01] persecuting the christians when he was
[34:02] holding stephen's guard the coach of the
[34:04] men that stoned stephen
[34:06] but this was the new man this was the
[34:08] man that was going to
[34:10] to take the gospel to everybody and
[34:13] and if you didn't believe it the way he
[34:14] believed they were going to kill you
[34:15] this was paul's
[34:17] idea but you got to realize
[34:20] you can't force this new man into your
[34:24] life
[34:25] people get to thinking if if i act
[34:27] better if i live a better life if if if
[34:30] i force myself
[34:31] not to do my old habits if i force
[34:34] myself
[34:35] not to drink if i force myself not to
[34:37] smoke if if i force myself
[34:39] you know i'm bitter towards this brother
[34:41] let's bring it up into the message now
[34:44] just because you don't drink and you
[34:46] don't smoke and you don't swear that
[34:47] don't mean you still don't have old man
[34:49] that's still alive
[34:52] satan's going to make sure that you
[34:53] remember that whether he's dead or not
[34:55] in your life
[34:56] satan's going to make sure that you know
[34:57] he's there
[34:59] he's going to remind you he's going to
[35:01] make you think even if
[35:02] you fill up the holy ghost and the new
[35:04] man which we'll find out later paul says
[35:06] he is christ
[35:07] but brahm said that that new new man
[35:09] that manifests himself in your life
[35:10] is christ it's not you anyway you can't
[35:13] force christ into your life
[35:15] you can't force yourself to have the
[35:16] holy ghost
[35:18] so just acting better just just trying
[35:20] to do away with the bad habits in your
[35:22] life you've had
[35:23] bitterness against his brother this
[35:24] sister for so long and you thought well
[35:26] i'm going to act better around them
[35:28] it's still there
[35:31] you just got the old man on a breathing
[35:32] machine he's still there
[35:34] you can't force it you have to kill him
[35:37] that's what paul's saying
[35:39] and brother branham says
[35:45] unless you rot until you rot to those
[35:47] things
[35:48] and give yourself into the hands of god
[35:51] then the old man will die when you take
[35:54] these things in your life
[35:56] you take the things that beset you
[35:59] you know just because you have the holy
[36:01] ghost doesn't mean that you
[36:02] don't have things that beset you you've
[36:04] heard that a million times in this
[36:06] in this church it does not
[36:08] de-christianize you because
[36:10] you have faults and you have mistakes
[36:13] that's part of his flesh
[36:15] if if the rapture was to come in in a
[36:18] split second
[36:20] you might make a mistake one split
[36:21] second before the rapture takes place
[36:26] that's humanity that's this flesh but
[36:29] you're going to a glorified body your
[36:30] theophany will come back
[36:31] and pick up a glorified body that new
[36:33] man will come back and pick up a
[36:35] glorified body
[36:36] that'll never make another mistake
[36:37] that'll it'll never need be healed that
[36:39] will
[36:40] never um sin in any way
[36:43] paul says in first corinthians 15 31 i
[36:46] protest
[36:47] by your rejoicing which i i have in
[36:50] christ jesus our lord
[36:51] i die daily paul died daily because he
[36:55] was
[36:56] daily reminded himself
[36:59] it was always i this is my opinion that
[37:01] paul always had in the back of his mind
[37:03] everything he'd done
[37:06] the people that god was sending him to
[37:08] now were the people that he killed
[37:11] the ones that he persecuted and paul
[37:13] says i have to die daily i have to
[37:15] remind myself
[37:16] that old man is no longer me with satan
[37:19] come to remind you of your mistakes all
[37:21] the time
[37:21] everything you've done and you sat and
[37:23] dwelled on that constantly you think
[37:25] that
[37:26] that life of jesus christ and you would
[37:28] rise up and be victorious if you was
[37:30] constantly dwelling on your past
[37:32] if you was constantly dwelling on the
[37:34] mistakes that you had in your life
[37:37] satan's going to remind you forget it
[37:38] he's going to remind you
[37:40] when you get the holy ghost and you feel
[37:41] like you come in one of these services
[37:43] and
[37:43] and you get filled with the holy ghost
[37:45] and you walk and you walk out that door
[37:48] and you feel like my life is renewed i'm
[37:51] regenerated
[37:52] the new man is manifested in my life and
[37:54] probably so
[37:57] but do not think that you're going to
[37:59] have that feeling
[38:00] you might not even have feeling the rest
[38:01] of the night it might leave you soon as
[38:03] you walk out the back door
[38:05] satan's going to remind you yeah but
[38:07] before you came to church you did this
[38:10] before you before yesterday you got to
[38:12] fight with your wife you did this
[38:15] you did this at work you you said this
[38:17] you looked at this you thought of this
[38:21] it's always going to be there but you
[38:23] have to keep your mind satan
[38:24] that's not me that's that's the old man
[38:29] and that's what paul said i die daily i
[38:32] die to myself i keep killing that old
[38:34] man
[38:35] daily i keep burying him but every time
[38:39] you bury him
[38:40] there's a resurrection there there
[38:43] cannot be
[38:44] a death without a resurrection if you're
[38:45] a seed of god
[38:48] that death is going to bring forth the
[38:50] resurrection
[38:53] no doubt it haunted him every day
[38:58] no i'd say paul nobody hated their past
[39:00] more than paul did
[39:01] you look at the worst things you've done
[39:03] in your life
[39:05] can you can you think i mean did you
[39:08] kill anybody
[39:11] have you did you persecute christians
[39:13] and hunt them down
[39:14] and kill them and torture them throw
[39:15] them in prison nobody's done that
[39:20] but this is the man that had to live
[39:21] with that every day in galatians 2 20.
[39:25] paul said i'm crucified with christ
[39:28] nevertheless
[39:30] i live paul crucified
[39:33] the old man paul says i'm crucifying him
[39:38] nevertheless i live but not i but christ
[39:41] liveth in me
[39:43] paul was saying me paul i died i
[39:47] crucified
[39:48] the resurrection was christ in his life
[39:51] it wasn't him
[39:52] he said it's not me it's christ it's
[39:54] christ that liveth in me
[39:56] and the life which i now live in the
[39:58] flesh i live
[39:59] by the faith of the son of god who loved
[40:01] me and gave himself for me
[40:04] he had a revelation that the new man was
[40:06] christ
[40:08] it was the seed life of christ being
[40:10] manifested in paul
[40:13] your we're sons and daughters by
[40:14] predestination
[40:16] you know we all we believe in
[40:18] predestination we believe that before
[40:19] the foundation of the world god had a
[40:21] thought of you and that when you was
[40:22] born he took that first breath of life
[40:24] and god placed that seed of life of
[40:26] himself
[40:27] inside of you and paul's saying this has
[40:31] become manifested in my life
[40:36] we've got to realize you know when satan
[40:38] keeps throwing the old man at us i mean
[40:39] when you're born you're born into flesh
[40:42] you're born in flesh shaped iniquity you
[40:45] came to the world speaking lies
[40:47] do you realize the new man and you came
[40:50] first
[40:52] this old man wasn't first the new man
[40:55] was first
[40:55] that new man of you was in god's
[40:58] thoughts before the foundation of the
[40:59] world
[41:00] only thing this does right here is
[41:02] transport him around
[41:04] you're eternal the real you the new man
[41:06] in your life is eternal
[41:08] it cannot be any other way but that
[41:09] because christ is eternal
[41:13] and paul says that new man in me is
[41:14] christ brother braham said that new man
[41:16] in you is christ
[41:18] it's not you so you can't work it up you
[41:20] can't try to
[41:21] to live right try trying to live right
[41:23] that's good morally
[41:25] that's a great thing to do morally try
[41:27] try to live right
[41:29] but you got to understand human trying
[41:32] human effort does not bring forth the
[41:35] new man
[41:36] it's yielding it's submitting yourself
[41:39] to god you're saying god i i can't i
[41:41] can't do away with this
[41:43] i can't take this out of my life i've
[41:44] struggled this with this for years
[41:46] i can't i can't take it away
[41:50] there's people even myself you know you
[41:52] have habits in your life that you've had
[41:55] your life that you tried and tried and
[41:57] tried mentally
[41:59] physically trying to stop on your own
[42:01] you might go a month or two you might go
[42:03] a year or two
[42:05] and then it keeps coming back because it
[42:08] was you
[42:09] putting forth the effort and it wasn't
[42:11] you yielding to the new man saying
[42:13] if i let this new man manifest himself
[42:15] in my life
[42:18] it won't be my efforts anymore it won't
[42:20] be me
[42:21] trying to get rid of it anymore it won't
[42:23] be me trying to live this life
[42:25] you can't live this life
[42:28] you can try your best to live a
[42:31] christian life
[42:33] you pick up this book and you start
[42:34] reading this book
[42:36] and you say i'm going to live everything
[42:38] i read in this book
[42:41] you'll be so confused
[42:44] if you read this with human
[42:45] understanding human intelligence
[42:48] you'll be so confused you won't know
[42:50] what you're doing right or wrong
[42:53] that that's that's the the issue that
[42:55] you know brother and i'm saying
[42:56] let the methodist theology rot let the
[42:59] baptist theology rot
[43:01] let the joelology rot let the hairy
[43:04] ology rot let it rot because it won't do
[43:06] you a bit of good
[43:08] until you've got the theology of the new
[43:11] man
[43:12] in your life teaching you how to yield
[43:15] teaching you how to let
[43:16] to let go of that old man to bury him to
[43:18] stab him to kill him blow his head off
[43:20] whatever you have to do but that's what
[43:23] you gotta
[43:24] that's what paul is telling us to do
[43:26] crucify yourself with christ
[43:29] paul says i crucified i'm crucified with
[43:31] christ we have to be
[43:33] we have to nail the old man to the tree
[43:36] just like paul did we can't resuscitate
[43:40] him
[43:41] we can't put him on a villain for later
[43:44] you know
[43:46] that's that's like taking things in your
[43:49] life and go and put them in a closet
[43:52] instead of destroying them
[43:56] you've got to sell out
[44:01] if you were in a stop before the
[44:03] foundation world
[44:05] the new man has no choice but to come to
[44:07] fruition in your life
[44:09] i promise you if you were in the
[44:11] thoughts of god
[44:12] before the foundation of the world that
[44:15] new man
[44:16] will eventually manifest in your life
[44:19] he's got no choice because it's a part
[44:21] of god
[44:23] it's a piece of god that little part
[44:26] that little seed
[44:28] we'll get into the seed part here in a
[44:30] minute but that little seed that god
[44:32] placed in you
[44:34] when you took your first breath of life
[44:37] you know brother brother brandon i'm
[44:39] telling the story about that 90 year old
[44:40] woman
[44:43] she said he led her to christ when she
[44:46] was 90.
[44:48] that seed of life laid in her for 90
[44:51] years
[44:53] when she took she was predestinated
[44:57] it took her 90 years for the new man to
[45:00] manifest
[45:01] itself in her life 90 years
[45:06] and there's people you see people come
[45:07] to church and don't get what they feel
[45:09] like they should get within a month and
[45:10] they leave and never come back
[45:13] you've got to understand just because
[45:16] just because you know there's things
[45:18] getting not revealed to you
[45:20] people give up because i they say i
[45:22] can't see it
[45:25] i don't know what this woman was
[45:28] i have no idea what denomination she
[45:31] belonged to
[45:33] but evidently what she was believing
[45:35] wasn't right
[45:38] and then god sent a prophet her way and
[45:40] said there's a new man in there
[45:43] there's somebody else in there and so
[45:45] what quickened that new man
[45:46] in this 90 year old woman's life
[45:50] what manifested it was watering of the
[45:52] word
[45:54] she heard the word it watered that seed
[45:56] and that seed
[45:57] came underneath the basking of the sun
[46:01] and that's 90 years old a seed comes to
[46:05] life
[46:10] thank you
[46:18] you know if if you go by the way of the
[46:21] grave
[46:22] if god takes us by the way of the grave
[46:25] you're filled with the holy ghost you
[46:28] have the holy ghost in your life
[46:30] and god and you die
[46:33] you we have a promise of a resurrection
[46:37] god promised you a resurrection if you
[46:39] die
[46:40] amen everybody believe that
[46:45] so if you die in your resurrection you
[46:47] come back in another body
[46:51] you're victorious over everything the
[46:53] body that you're now in
[46:57] is victorious there's no more death
[47:00] there's no more
[47:00] sickness there's no more depression
[47:02] there's no more financial troubles
[47:04] there's there's nothing there's no
[47:06] bitterness there's no hatred there's no
[47:08] nothing
[47:08] so and then that's what you will find
[47:12] in the rapture in the resurrected body
[47:13] if you go by the way of the grave
[47:16] do you realize you do not have to wait
[47:19] till you're resurrected to have that
[47:23] when that old man dies and there's a
[47:26] resurrection
[47:27] of a new man in your life
[47:30] you have the same victory over all of
[47:33] those things
[47:34] that a resurrected raptured body would
[47:36] have brother branham said if jesus stood
[47:38] right here
[47:39] in my suit and you come up here to get
[47:42] prayed for
[47:44] he couldn't heal you
[47:47] he said he couldn't heal you anymore
[47:48] because it's already done
[47:51] everything that you ever needed if
[47:52] you're a predestinated son or daughter
[47:54] of god
[47:55] everything that you ever needed it's
[47:56] already been done
[47:59] it's by faith it's it's a walk of faith
[48:04] and paul says i now live in the flesh
[48:07] i live by the faith of the son of god
[48:09] who loved me and gave himself for me
[48:11] so i don't care to crucify myself with
[48:13] him
[48:14] i don't care to kill the old man because
[48:17] i i know
[48:18] that it's not me that that's living the
[48:20] new man is not me
[48:22] it's christ living you've got to let
[48:23] christ live in your life
[48:25] you've got to let the life of christ be
[48:26] predominant in your life more than
[48:28] anything else
[48:29] and paul says only way you could do that
[48:31] is by faith
[48:34] faith in the son of god
[48:42] he's never failed
[48:46] when you have the new man
[48:50] in your life everything that you would
[48:52] have in a resurrected body you already
[48:53] have
[48:55] with the resurrection of the new man in
[48:56] your life he'll never fail
[48:58] he's never felt anything he's ever said
[49:00] he would do he's done it
[49:02] he can't go back and finish something
[49:04] because he already finished it
[49:06] you know we had situation here at our
[49:09] church
[49:09] several years ago
[49:13] you know threats and stuff because
[49:16] things that were said here
[49:19] and after about six seven months eight
[49:22] months i don't know maybe even a year
[49:24] i was driving by one day and i just felt
[49:26] pressed up on my heart
[49:28] to come pray for brother jimmy brother
[49:30] jimmy was catching the brunt of all of
[49:31] it mostly
[49:34] and and i walked into the library and i
[49:36] might have said that here before
[49:38] this before i don't know i walked into
[49:41] the library and i said brother jimmy
[49:43] just something
[49:44] is pulling on my heart to come in here
[49:45] and pray with you
[49:47] so me and brother jimmy had prayer and
[49:49] he told me long
[49:50] sometime later he said things started to
[49:52] change he said it
[49:54] it happened well this past year
[49:58] you know we we got some more you know i
[50:00] had some people calling me and telling
[50:02] me you know hey
[50:03] this is possibly going to happen at your
[50:04] church and all this
[50:06] and and from that that point on and i
[50:10] would tell whoever would i text i had
[50:12] texts i had phone calls
[50:13] and man i appreciated it but i told them
[50:16] whoever
[50:17] whoever would call me and tell me
[50:20] i said god has never started a work he
[50:23] hasn't finished
[50:26] when prayer was made god took that away
[50:31] but that does not mean satan's not going
[50:32] to throw a bluff up in your face
[50:36] that does not mean that satan is not
[50:38] just because you overcome one battle
[50:41] that don't mean satan ain't going to try
[50:42] to throw the same battle at you
[50:45] he don't accept it throw his hands up
[50:46] well he's good at that i'm not going to
[50:48] pack him with that no more
[50:50] that's not the way it works but god
[50:54] will never incomplete a work
[50:57] he always finishes everything he starts
[51:01] and he does it well so you
[51:04] you know when we look at look people
[51:06] dealing with covid we look at people
[51:07] dealing with cancer in their lives right
[51:09] now
[51:09] and we look at it and we you know we
[51:11] pray we pray and we pray and we seem
[51:13] like we struggle
[51:14] through the prayer lord when's this
[51:15] going to change god's got everything
[51:18] under control
[51:22] don't don't look at it and think well
[51:23] god didn't do that
[51:25] maybe god's got a greater plan than your
[51:27] prayer
[51:30] god's got something working more in your
[51:32] prayer
[51:33] that new man in your life maybe he needs
[51:36] the old man needs a little bit more
[51:37] killing first
[51:41] so looking at looking at that you know
[51:44] at the things that's happening around us
[51:47] today politics it's all corrupt
[51:50] but i trust you know as time comes down
[51:53] because you look at the signs of the
[51:54] time
[51:54] i've i've had i've had people that don't
[51:58] know the thing about this message
[52:00] tell me signs this is the signs of the
[52:03] time the end time

[52:07] don't believe
[52:08] and they're telling you this is the end
[52:11] time
[52:14] the signs are everywhere
[52:17] but in the in the body of the new man
[52:19] that's manifested in your life
[52:22] you don't have to look at that you know
[52:24] when the children of israel
[52:25] when all the plagues were going through
[52:28] through egypt
[52:30] there was no plagues in goshen when
[52:33] there was
[52:33] gross darkness in egypt there was light
[52:35] and goshen
[52:37] god's still going to shine a little
[52:38] light on this bride
[52:40] god's still going to manifest himself
[52:43] his seed life
[52:44] in this bride it don't matter to me
[52:47] that's what gives me the greatest joy
[52:49] that it does not
[52:50] matter what happens in the world around
[52:53] me
[52:56] it's the life that i have inside it'll
[52:59] keep you through it all
[53:00] if you have that life if you don't have
[53:02] that life if you're still counting on
[53:04] this
[53:04] old man to pull you through these hard
[53:07] times
[53:09] you better pull the plug on him because
[53:11] he's going to fail you
[53:13] you have to kill him
[53:17] spoken word is original seed i put a
[53:20] note down here
[53:21] it said natural the natural type
[53:24] now therefore true life can come can
[53:27] only come or re
[53:28] reproduce itself by its original
[53:30] breeding
[53:32] now study that when you're studying the
[53:34] tapes
[53:35] study it now life l-i-f-e can only be
[53:39] reproduced by its original breeding the
[53:41] way it started in the beginning
[53:43] then it reproduces itself
[53:48] what is the the seed life in you
[53:52] that's god re reproducing himself that's
[53:55] what he did with mary
[53:57] he produced a body that he himself can
[54:00] come into
[54:02] and this word will do the exact same
[54:04] thing
[54:05] as it did to mary this this word will
[54:08] water that seed
[54:10] that s-o-n will shine on that seed
[54:13] and that seed will give birth to life
[54:17] that's christ reproducing himself and
[54:20] you and in me
[54:22] you know when i was studying this
[54:26] you know i was studying it you know how
[54:28] god had a vision in his mind and his
[54:31] thoughts brother branham
[54:32] so often how we've heard it brother
[54:34] branham said you know you were
[54:35] in god's thought before the foundation
[54:38] of the world you know
[54:39] and he had a perfect image of what he
[54:42] wanted you to be
[54:44] he had a perfect idea in his mind this
[54:46] this is
[54:47] exactly what i want brother harry to be
[54:49] this right here
[54:51] is the very image brother harry no
[54:53] matter what you've done in life no
[54:55] matter the mistakes you've done
[54:57] anything you've done in your life god
[54:58] has never lost that perfect image of you
[55:01] he's never had another image in you and
[55:03] i was thinking of this in in a matter of
[55:05] of speaking naturally
[55:07] when my when my dad and my mom gave
[55:10] birth to me
[55:11] i was the best kid they ever had i don't
[55:14] care what any of them tell you
[55:16] but my when my dad when i was born
[55:21] when my dad was born he had a vision in
[55:24] his mind that
[55:25] that when i got older you know this is
[55:27] what he wanted me to be
[55:29] naturally speaking that don't mean that
[55:30] was going to happen but he still
[55:33] had a vision he still had a thought of
[55:36] what he wanted me to be
[55:38] now as you know kid growing up my dad
[55:40] was my hero my dad
[55:41] is even more my hero now because i can
[55:43] see now the things that my dad
[55:45] sacrificed things that he gave up
[55:48] for me as a child you don't see that
[55:53] you don't understand
[55:57] things in your in your parents life they
[56:00] go through as a child so you know when i
[56:01] was born
[56:02] i couldn't look at my dad and say one
[56:04] day i'm going to look just like him i
[56:06] had no idea
[56:08] he had an idea he had an idea
[56:12] what i mean he's not god but he had an
[56:14] idea that one day i would be
[56:16] pretty much his image i didn't know that
[56:21] you didn't know that when you came into
[56:22] this world you didn't you know and god
[56:24] had this image in your mind his mind
[56:27] you might have been lost in sin for the
[56:28] first 30 years of your life
[56:31] you had no idea that god had this image
[56:33] of you in his mind
[56:36] so growing up you know and i look at my
[56:38] dad to me my dad was was the the biggest
[56:40] the strongest the fastest the baddest
[56:42] man
[56:44] in hardy arkansas
[56:49] there were some bad dudes there in in
[56:52] in my mind you know growing up you hear
[56:55] people tell you you have your dad's eyes
[56:57] you have your dad's nose you have you
[56:59] have your dad's smile
[57:01] but as you grow as a child and you grow
[57:04] and
[57:04] and then as you get older you start to
[57:07] see little manifestations in your life
[57:10] that look like your father your natural
[57:11] father
[57:14] you know it's it's nothing that's
[57:15] planned out
[57:17] you know i could i could have been you
[57:20] know
[57:20] i could look like my mom it might have
[57:23] been better
[57:25] than looking like my dad
[57:28] but at some point i i get into
[57:31] the full revelation of what my dad
[57:34] wanted of me
[57:37] it might have took 30 40 50 years
[57:42] but spiritually speaking and the same
[57:44] thing god had this image
[57:46] of each one of us in his mind before the
[57:48] foundation world it's always been there
[57:50] the thought of you has never not been in
[57:52] god's mind it's never not been there
[57:56] that's what brother said brother braham
[57:57] said you came from eternity you go back
[57:59] to eternity
[58:00] because that that image has always been
[58:02] there
[58:06] so in order for me to manifest
[58:12] gary hara in myself i had to become a
[58:15] different person
[58:17] i didn't look like him when i was a
[58:19] toddler i didn't really look like him
[58:21] when i was a teenager
[58:23] i had to come full manifestation of what
[58:27] he thought i would one day be
[58:31] i had to become a new man i had to
[58:32] become a man i wasn't this
[58:34] little child was the old man
[58:37] i got my tail busted a bunch
[58:41] because i made mistakes
[58:44] i did things i shouldn't have done
[58:49] but then i had to become a new person i
[58:51] had to become a new creature paul says
[58:53] therefore if any man be in christ he is
[58:55] a new creature
[58:56] old things are passed away behold all
[58:59] things become new
[59:01] and this word new says as respects
[59:06] form recently made fresh recent unused
[59:09] unworn new which is recently made
[59:12] is superior to what succeeds and this
[59:16] i put a note down here unworn is as a
[59:18] new garment putting on new clothes
[59:20] throwing away the old clothes
[59:23] we see this picture in the prodigal son
[59:26] we see the prodigal the old man left he
[59:28] said give me what's mine
[59:31] i'm going to go make it on my own
[59:34] i'm going to become
[59:50] this is good
[59:54] so we see how that worked out for paul
[1:00:00] i mean for the prodigal son he left he
[1:00:03] said give give me everything
[1:00:04] that's mine and i'll leave so he the old
[1:00:08] man he's leaving the old man is leaving
[1:00:12] but what did the father say when he come
[1:00:14] back
[1:00:16] he said my son that was dead
[1:00:21] the son that had died
[1:00:24] he's now alive the father testified that
[1:00:27] there was a resurrection
[1:00:29] so what's he going to do he's going to
[1:00:30] clothe him in new garments that are
[1:00:32] unworn
[1:00:35] it's new he's alive he was lost but now
[1:00:39] he's found
[1:00:40] he was dead this is the parable of a
[1:00:44] resurrection
[1:00:46] in this young man's life you know when
[1:00:49] god changes you
[1:00:52] when god takes that takes that away from
[1:00:55] you
[1:00:57] you become a new creature like i said
[1:00:59] before no doubt paul
[1:01:01] was haunted daily by his mistakes
[1:01:05] but god puts it in see if forgetfulness
[1:01:08] never to be remembered
[1:01:11] you know if we could forget you know
[1:01:13] when the devil brings up things
[1:01:14] to us in our lives we can tell him satan
[1:01:16] i didn't do that
[1:01:19] i didn't do that that wasn't me that was
[1:01:22] the old man
[1:01:24] you know i i had the privilege of coming
[1:01:25] in here one night and with the young
[1:01:27] people
[1:01:28] and they've been going through the
[1:01:29] series
[1:01:31] the chosen have y'all everybody heard
[1:01:33] the chosen and
[1:01:34] in this particular one it really struck
[1:01:36] out to me stuck out to me because
[1:01:39] it had mary who jesus had cast seven
[1:01:42] devils out
[1:01:44] you know in the storyline in the movie
[1:01:46] that show it tells how nicodemus
[1:01:48] had met with with mary and was going to
[1:01:51] get rid of these demons for was going to
[1:01:54] cast them off and it didn't work and in
[1:01:56] the movie
[1:01:57] it shows him talking to the people in
[1:02:01] the
[1:02:01] sanhedrin and he said i'm going to go
[1:02:03] investigate this
[1:02:05] i'm gonna go find out what happened to
[1:02:06] her
[1:02:08] and i'll get back with you so he comes
[1:02:11] up to mary
[1:02:12] and he starts calling her by her old
[1:02:13] name lilith and then what stuck out to
[1:02:16] me is when he starts calling her by her
[1:02:18] name
[1:02:18] her old name she don't comprehend
[1:02:23] she don't know who that person is
[1:02:26] she forgot god forgot
[1:02:30] and then he starts reminding her what
[1:02:31] had happened to her
[1:02:35] she had no idea she had forgot
[1:02:38] she couldn't remember it
[1:02:41] she was now a new person she said that's
[1:02:43] not my name my name is mary
[1:02:48] that's just like the devil coming to you
[1:02:50] all the time telling you you've done
[1:02:52] this
[1:02:53] you can tell him that's the old man
[1:02:54] that's not me
[1:02:58] you know if if satan if satan gets us
[1:03:00] focused
[1:03:02] on the old man so often if he if he gets
[1:03:05] you to keep your focus there
[1:03:07] you can it's hard to grow you know
[1:03:10] you watch people sometimes battling
[1:03:12] things and and sometimes
[1:03:13] and coming at church and they sit there
[1:03:15] and the the service is going forth
[1:03:18] the anointing is moving and they sit
[1:03:19] there blank
[1:03:21] sometimes they sit there and they and
[1:03:23] they and they wallow in their in their
[1:03:24] depression and they
[1:03:25] they waller in their issues they got it
[1:03:27] home and and everywhere else
[1:03:29] when the greatest source they have is
[1:03:31] coming from right up here
[1:03:34] and they sit there and and don't get
[1:03:36] involved and and they don't pull on the
[1:03:38] gift and they don't
[1:03:38] they don't ask the lord lord i need i
[1:03:40] mean this is the time that you need
[1:03:42] something more than any time
[1:03:44] and they sit there and they wallow in
[1:03:46] their in their their self-pity
[1:03:48] yeah you're going through things
[1:03:50] everybody's going through things
[1:03:53] but this is where you get help this
[1:03:56] on sunday and saturday and wednesday you
[1:03:59] come in and you get under the watering
[1:04:00] of the word
[1:04:02] that's what helps that seed life of that
[1:04:04] new man grow
[1:04:06] there's no growth there's no
[1:04:07] resurrection
[1:04:10] you're not going to resurrect a new man
[1:04:13] by focusing on your issues
[1:04:15] focusing on your problems when you
[1:04:18] should be focusing on the one that can
[1:04:19] fix him
[1:04:23] brother braham says not because your
[1:04:27] father was something
[1:04:29] it's what are you every man's got to be
[1:04:32] born again
[1:04:34] i'm losing time i'm going to have to
[1:04:35] skip some stuff
[1:04:38] a new man every man
[1:04:41] got to be born again and this sinful
[1:04:43] nature killed in him and a new man born
[1:04:45] in him which is christ jesus the son of
[1:04:46] god
[1:04:47] bill abraham said that new man that is
[1:04:49] born in you
[1:04:50] is christ jesus it's not
[1:04:54] you as a better person morally
[1:04:57] you're not better because you're trying
[1:05:00] to do better
[1:05:01] what makes you better is christ living
[1:05:03] in you
[1:05:05] christ the hope of glory
[1:05:10] then you surrender yourself completely
[1:05:12] to christ and christ comes in and writes
[1:05:13] a book of acts through you
[1:05:16] how i know that's the truth my friend
[1:05:18] how i know it's the truth
[1:05:20] so how do we know there's a new man
[1:05:22] living in us
[1:05:24] how do you know
[1:05:27] where where does the life come from
[1:05:30] where does the life of this new man come
[1:05:31] from
[1:05:34] like i said we can't work it up we can't
[1:05:36] we can't sit there and
[1:05:37] conjure it up and and and pump it and
[1:05:40] prime it like brother brand i'm talking
[1:05:41] you should talk about you get one of my
[1:05:42] wells and you try to
[1:05:43] prime it up you can't you can't prime
[1:05:45] the holy ghost into your life
[1:05:47] it's a gift how do you get that gift by
[1:05:50] yielding
[1:05:56] i'll jump ahead here i apologize i'm
[1:05:57] running out of time
[1:05:59] first john 3 8 he that committed sin is
[1:06:03] of the devil
[1:06:04] for the devil sinneth from the beginning
[1:06:08] for this purpose the son of god was
[1:06:10] manifested that he might destroy the
[1:06:11] works of the devil
[1:06:14] whosoever is born of god doth not commit
[1:06:16] sin
[1:06:18] for his seed remaineth in him god's seed
[1:06:21] remaineth in him
[1:06:23] and he cannot sin because he is born of
[1:06:25] god
[1:06:27] that's a perfect example of the new man
[1:06:30] god's seed in you birthing in you
[1:06:34] as a seed of god so what's a seed
[1:06:41] children offspring prodigy family race
[1:06:45] prosperity whatever possesses
[1:06:48] vital force of life-giving power
[1:06:51] or life-giving power the holy spirit the
[1:06:54] divine energy operating within the soul
[1:06:56] by which we are regenerated
[1:07:00] you know when studying this when i was
[1:07:03] studying got into studying the seed life
[1:07:07] and brother branham refers to it a lot
[1:07:08] in different sermons and
[1:07:12] you know we've always we've heard for
[1:07:13] for years you know and it's it's a
[1:07:16] wonderful
[1:07:17] it would only take the the mind of a
[1:07:20] prophet
[1:07:21] or god revealing it to a prophet that
[1:07:23] that you was in the mind of god before
[1:07:25] the foundation of the world
[1:07:27] how about you when you was in his
[1:07:28] thoughts and that thought when you took
[1:07:30] your
[1:07:30] first breath of life god took that
[1:07:32] thought and dropped it into your
[1:07:35] into your soul
[1:07:38] only a prophet could know that you know
[1:07:41] i mean we we
[1:07:42] we read in in the scriptures you know
[1:07:45] that paul and him
[1:07:46] touch on it to an extent
[1:07:50] but in this last age we got a deeper
[1:07:52] look into the mind of god
[1:07:54] we got a deeper look into where we came
[1:07:56] from
[1:07:57] you know and looking at that you know i
[1:07:59] never didn't understand it for years so
[1:08:02] when i when i put this together now i i
[1:08:05] don't hear audible voices speak to me
[1:08:07] when i'm studying i never have
[1:08:09] probably never will it just comes as
[1:08:10] thoughts
[1:08:13] when i was studying this lord is
[1:08:16] probably
[1:08:16] two three months ago and thought came to
[1:08:19] me you know how to understand
[1:08:22] god dropping a thought whenever i come
[1:08:26] out of the womb
[1:08:26] in my first breath of life and god sets
[1:08:30] that seed down in there
[1:08:33] you know and i used looked at an example
[1:08:35] of an oak tree
[1:08:37] i'm gonna put this on first grade level
[1:08:39] so i can understand
[1:08:42] look at an oak tree i got to looking at
[1:08:44] oak trees this week
[1:08:46] you know they say some of them grow over
[1:08:48] 100 feet tall
[1:08:50] they'll live from anywhere from 120 to
[1:08:52] 150 years some people say they live
[1:08:54] almost a thousand years
[1:08:57] but the oak tree is both male and female
[1:09:00] they have what they call male flowers
[1:09:02] and female flowers in the
[1:09:04] the the seed comes out of the the female
[1:09:07] flower and
[1:09:07] the pollen from the male flower
[1:09:09] pollinates it and it forms an acre
[1:09:12] and just like the thought of god that
[1:09:15] big old hundred foot
[1:09:16] oak tree drops an acre
[1:09:20] into the dirt
[1:09:25] now if that acorn had any intelligence
[1:09:28] this here comes the first grade level
[1:09:31] if it had two eyeballs and it could look
[1:09:34] up at this big hundred foot eight
[1:09:36] oak tree and and look at that and say
[1:09:40] wow that is a big tree
[1:09:44] my daddy is huge and be amazed at the
[1:09:49] size
[1:09:50] of this tree that gave birth to him
[1:09:54] but that's all he knows he has no idea
[1:09:58] every single piece of dna
[1:10:02] that's in that tree is in him
[1:10:06] he has no idea now studying this
[1:10:10] an acorn can't really thrive
[1:10:15] underneath the branches of an oak tree
[1:10:19] it requires animals rat rodents
[1:10:21] squirrels whatever to pick up that acorn
[1:10:23] and carry it off somewhere or rain to
[1:10:25] wash it away
[1:10:28] to put it through some trials
[1:10:32] it'll fall into the river you may get
[1:10:36] washed
[1:10:37] 100 miles down the river
[1:10:41] in a flood will come and as the flood
[1:10:43] comes the water rises
[1:10:44] and this acre and gets washed up on the
[1:10:46] bank
[1:10:48] and it lands in some soil
[1:10:52] and it gets buried still has no idea
[1:10:57] he is or what he is where he came from
[1:11:00] he just knows he's got a big daddy
[1:11:02] that's all he knows he has no idea that
[1:11:06] one day
[1:11:07] he'll look exactly like him
[1:11:11] he'll look just like that big old tree
[1:11:15] so is this this little acre and this
[1:11:17] little seed goes into the ground
[1:11:20] winter comes and all he sees
[1:11:24] is darkness dirt piled around him and it
[1:11:26] gets cold and hard
[1:11:28] there's no life there we've all been
[1:11:31] there
[1:11:33] even with the holy ghost in your life
[1:11:35] you've gone through them moments in your
[1:11:36] life
[1:11:37] where you feel no growth everything
[1:11:40] around you is cold
[1:11:41] and hard and dark
[1:11:44] you're going to go through those times
[1:11:48] and as this little acorn lays there
[1:11:53] eventually spring will roll around
[1:11:57] and you'll feel the dampness in the
[1:11:59] earth
[1:12:00] you feel something get warm
[1:12:04] it feels a little stimulation inside of
[1:12:06] him
[1:12:08] something inside of him will begin to
[1:12:10] move
[1:12:12] it may be slow and gradual it might take
[1:12:15] him service after service after service
[1:12:19] of the watering but begins to grow and
[1:12:23] he feels
[1:12:25] movement around him you've got to
[1:12:28] understand when a seed is in the ground
[1:12:31] there's nutrients in the ground that
[1:12:33] help that seed to grow
[1:12:35] there's nutrients in there there's
[1:12:37] calcium there's potash
[1:12:39] petroleum different things
[1:12:43] that help this seed grow now in studying
[1:12:47] that i got to thinking about that
[1:12:50] you know just because there's things in
[1:12:52] our life we see it all the time
[1:12:54] you know i call these nutrients gifts
[1:12:59] we've got god allows nutrients in our
[1:13:01] life to stimulate growth
[1:13:04] but they are not the life god allows
[1:13:07] speaking in tongues
[1:13:09] he lies laying on hands
[1:13:14] the gift of preaching the gift of
[1:13:16] singing the gift of songwriting the gift
[1:13:17] of plain music
[1:13:19] that's not the life
[1:13:22] it's a nutrient god put in the soil so
[1:13:24] when we we glorify them things
[1:13:28] you're glorifying dirt
[1:13:32] that's that's something that god put in
[1:13:34] the dirt
[1:13:35] in the dirt to stimulate the growth of
[1:13:38] the life
[1:13:39] but that is not the life when you give
[1:13:42] glory to
[1:13:43] how well you preach or whoever got
[1:13:45] healed because you laid hands on them
[1:13:47] because you speak in tongues because you
[1:13:48] can write a song because you can sing a
[1:13:50] song
[1:13:50] you're glorifying dirt
[1:13:53] god allows that there that's for the
[1:13:56] body
[1:13:56] that's that's to grow those are
[1:13:59] nutrients just like the stimulate this
[1:14:01] little acorn seed
[1:14:02] in the ground stimulate it to grow
[1:14:05] but as this thing begins to grow the
[1:14:07] outer laying of this acorn
[1:14:09] this seed begins to die
[1:14:13] in order to growth the outer layer
[1:14:18] has to die it has to rot it has to be
[1:14:20] buried
[1:14:22] for the life on the inside to come out
[1:14:24] and when that thing becomes an oak tree
[1:14:26] you can dig the china and you'll never
[1:14:28] find
[1:14:28] one piece of that old man or that seed
[1:14:32] you'll never find one cell of it
[1:14:35] because it's a new man
[1:14:39] so is this acorn as this acre and lays
[1:14:43] there
[1:14:46] and it begins to grow and eventually
[1:14:50] he comes out
[1:14:53] and as he comes out
[1:14:56] he hears something say good morning and
[1:14:59] it's the sun
[1:15:02] it's the s-u-n do you think that little
[1:15:06] acre and jumped up and said
[1:15:08] i've been searching for you for so long
[1:15:10] son
[1:15:12] rain i've been looking for you all my
[1:15:14] life
[1:15:16] that little seed had no idea that
[1:15:18] existed
[1:15:20] the sun says i was here all the time
[1:15:24] the entire time you were in the ground
[1:15:26] through your dark times
[1:15:28] through the times where you didn't know
[1:15:32] where the cold was coming from where the
[1:15:33] dark was coming from
[1:15:35] through those times i was here i shone
[1:15:38] during the
[1:15:38] dark times i shown deer in the cold
[1:15:41] times
[1:15:42] i was right here
[1:15:46] and that seed begins to grow
[1:15:52] but it has to go through things
[1:15:58] you know the life inside that
[1:16:01] seed thirsted for something had no idea
[1:16:05] what it was
[1:16:06] he didn't have no idea the song was
[1:16:08] there people telling you they they
[1:16:09] searched for god
[1:16:10] they got on their knees and searched for
[1:16:12] god that's how they came to the message
[1:16:13] because they were searching for god and
[1:16:15] and they found god never happened they
[1:16:18] didn't find god no more than this
[1:16:20] seed found the sun it don't work that
[1:16:23] way
[1:16:24] if you were already in the mind of god
[1:16:28] god knew where you were the whole time
[1:16:33] though this flesh might have been lost
[1:16:36] the old man might have had you lost god
[1:16:39] knew where he was the whole time
[1:16:45] romans 8 10 11 and if christ
[1:16:50] be in you the body is dead because of
[1:16:53] sin but the
[1:16:54] spirit is life because of righteousness
[1:16:58] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:16:59] christ from the dead dwell in you he
[1:17:01] he raised up christ from the dead shall
[1:17:03] quicken your mortal bodies by his flesh
[1:17:05] that dwelleth
[1:17:06] in you this seed was quickened
[1:17:13] you know
[1:17:16] whenever people say you know
[1:17:20] speaking in tongues and you know back on
[1:17:22] the nutrients
[1:17:23] thing again you know that
[1:17:27] speaking in tongues is is you know a lot
[1:17:29] of people say it's the gift of the holy
[1:17:30] ghost which we know it ain't
[1:17:31] pentecostals believe that and some of
[1:17:33] them trying to transition over into the
[1:17:34] message
[1:17:36] you know it's not it's not wrong to have
[1:17:39] those things
[1:17:40] it's not wrong to ask for these
[1:17:42] nutrients these stimulants in your
[1:17:44] in your life you remember the the sister
[1:17:47] that brother branham
[1:17:48] told about that she had the holy ghost
[1:17:50] brother brown says she had the holy
[1:17:51] ghost
[1:17:53] but she can't believe it so brother
[1:17:55] branham told her
[1:17:56] to go pray and ask god to give you the
[1:17:59] gift of speaking in tongues
[1:18:01] ask god to give you this stimulant that
[1:18:04] will help the growth of that life
[1:18:07] you know there's people that might have
[1:18:09] to do that
[1:18:13] but we can't place glory in this in this
[1:18:16] soul
[1:18:20] and that seed in order for the grow will
[1:18:22] have to continue to sit under the
[1:18:23] washing of the water of the word
[1:18:25] we'll have to bask in the sunlight to
[1:18:28] have growth
[1:18:30] and then eventually we'll come into the
[1:18:31] image
[1:18:33] of the big father oak that's the same
[1:18:35] thing in our life
[1:18:36] you know we come in here and you know i
[1:18:39] know what's different with covet and all
[1:18:41] that and
[1:18:42] you have a lot of most people just about
[1:18:44] everybody has to sit at home
[1:18:47] but it's still the word i know it's a
[1:18:49] different atmosphere it's still the word
[1:18:52] you know and i understand brother donny
[1:18:55] he
[1:18:55] hates having to do this because when
[1:18:58] you've got a whole group of believers in
[1:18:59] here
[1:19:00] pulling it makes a huge difference
[1:19:03] it makes a huge difference and i'd say
[1:19:04] it makes a difference with a singing and
[1:19:06] everything as well
[1:19:08] but still we have to get under that
[1:19:09] watering of the word
[1:19:14] so whose life is inside you
[1:19:18] who is the life that's inside you
[1:19:21] souls that are in prison now but that
[1:19:24] soul
[1:19:25] in there see that soul is what god is
[1:19:28] working on see
[1:19:30] if he can get that nature that spirit to
[1:19:32] agree with him
[1:19:33] then that nature dies the nature and the
[1:19:35] love of the world dies the things of the
[1:19:37] world is dead
[1:19:38] if you love the world the things of the
[1:19:40] world the love of the father is not
[1:19:41] the love of god is not in you a man must
[1:19:44] be born again
[1:19:45] so this nature has to die and the nature
[1:19:47] of god comes in and lives in you and god
[1:19:50] is the only thing
[1:19:52] there is that never did begin or never
[1:19:55] can end
[1:19:57] therefore he has partnership you see and
[1:20:00] taken this man earthly
[1:20:02] and this eternal spirit and put it
[1:20:04] together
[1:20:06] it's taken your earthly body and this
[1:20:09] eternal spirit
[1:20:11] and made it one that's the only way
[1:20:13] you're going to have the life
[1:20:15] if god done that when you
[1:20:18] when you receive the holy ghost
[1:20:22] god took this earthly body and the holy
[1:20:25] spirit
[1:20:25] and put him together
[1:20:29] because god reflected himself back in
[1:20:31] that he become a man
[1:20:33] when he became jesus christ and he was
[1:20:35] god see
[1:20:36] he was in christ lived in him
[1:20:39] reconciling the world to himself
[1:20:41] and through that perfect man each one of
[1:20:44] us
[1:20:45] imperfect we're all imperfect this flesh
[1:20:48] is imperfect
[1:20:49] each one of us imperfect that believing
[1:20:51] god has accepted us
[1:20:53] has accepted that and we become the
[1:20:56] perfection of him
[1:20:58] when that life manifests in you that new
[1:21:01] man
[1:21:02] that seed manifests in you you become
[1:21:05] the perfection of god
[1:21:08] that's all god that that is god's main
[1:21:10] purpose
[1:21:12] is to have a bride that is him nothing
[1:21:15] short of that
[1:21:17] that that's god's greatest desire
[1:21:21] the greatest desire that god could look
[1:21:23] down through eternity and
[1:21:24] you look at yourself everybody take a
[1:21:26] look at yourself and think me why would
[1:21:28] god
[1:21:29] the great creator of all this earth
[1:21:32] feel like that he can take this body
[1:21:35] and be perfect in this body in johara's
[1:21:39] body
[1:21:41] if i want to reflect on the old man i
[1:21:43] can say lord look what i've done
[1:21:47] i can say that but god says i don't have
[1:21:49] no image of that
[1:21:50] i've never seen that
[1:21:54] but that's what satan wants you god says
[1:21:56] i want you to be my perfection
[1:21:58] satan says you'll never be his
[1:21:59] perfection
[1:22:01] long as you keep looking at the old man
[1:22:03] and you never water the seed
[1:22:05] of life that's down on the inside if you
[1:22:07] never water that
[1:22:10] if you never read if you never pray
[1:22:13] if you're not listening to the word how
[1:22:15] are you going to have growth
[1:22:18] everything's going to that seed is going
[1:22:19] to go back into a dark cold state in the
[1:22:22] ground
[1:22:25] you won't have growth that way so in
[1:22:28] order to become the perfection of god
[1:22:31] i've never heard this quote before but
[1:22:33] brother branham said
[1:22:35] we've become the perfection of him when
[1:22:38] the holy spirit god places that in you
[1:22:41] the holy spirit into an imperfect body
[1:22:45] it's like the that's just like the ink
[1:22:47] in the bleach
[1:22:49] when god puts that holy spirit in that
[1:22:51] imperfect body there's no more
[1:22:53] imperfection
[1:22:54] there's no more it's all the
[1:22:56] imperfections are gone
[1:22:58] when that new man takes over we become
[1:23:01] his perfection
[1:23:04] god refuses god refuses
[1:23:10] i don't know how to put this he cannot
[1:23:14] and will not be perfect without you
[1:23:18] he refuses to be perfect without you
[1:23:23] our human minds cannot comprehend god's
[1:23:26] desire
[1:23:28] because we we try to put our minds at
[1:23:30] such a high level
[1:23:32] of thinking this is the way god must
[1:23:34] think and we we put it so far out of
[1:23:36] reach and god says it's right down here
[1:23:38] in simplicity
[1:23:39] it's so simple all i want
[1:23:43] is to live in you and me and you be
[1:23:45] perfect together
[1:23:46] i want my seed life to grow in you
[1:23:50] but our human minds can't comprehend
[1:23:52] that a god so great would think that low
[1:23:57] it's as simple as a lie as a seed being
[1:23:59] planted in the ground
[1:24:02] rain falling on it in the spring sun
[1:24:04] shining on in the spring through the
[1:24:05] summer
[1:24:06] and it grows that's how simple god wants
[1:24:07] to make it
[1:24:09] that's the only way i can understand it
[1:24:12] how many times we heard brother brahm
[1:24:14] say the natural types of spiritual so
[1:24:15] many times
[1:24:16] it types of spiritual
[1:24:21] you know god didn't god didn't
[1:24:24] do that for you because he felt sorry
[1:24:26] for you
[1:24:28] god didn't feel sorry for you god didn't
[1:24:30] do you
[1:24:31] i was i was watching the old victorian
[1:24:34] show sometime in this
[1:24:35] this peasant woman this this
[1:24:39] noble guy fell in love with this peasant
[1:24:43] woman
[1:24:45] any and he married her and the whole
[1:24:48] time
[1:24:50] she would talk to her friends you know
[1:24:52] when he went around the whole time
[1:24:54] she felt like she owed him so much she
[1:24:58] thought that
[1:24:58] he did me a favor by marrying me because
[1:25:01] he felt sorry for me
[1:25:03] and so one of these noble men came to
[1:25:05] her and she was giving this little
[1:25:07] speech to him about
[1:25:09] you know i'll never be good enough
[1:25:12] for him and he said
[1:25:16] he didn't do you a favor by marrying you
[1:25:20] he didn't do you a favor he did it out
[1:25:23] of pure undying love
[1:25:26] nothing short of that god didn't look at
[1:25:27] you and say there's a dirty old peasant
[1:25:30] woman
[1:25:31] i need to rescue her the very first
[1:25:34] image that god ever had in you in his
[1:25:36] mind
[1:25:37] was a pure white
[1:25:40] without blemish clean bride that's how
[1:25:44] he looked at you
[1:25:45] he's never seen you in any other way i
[1:25:48] don't know how many
[1:25:49] much clearer i can make that god has
[1:25:51] never seen you
[1:25:52] imperfect so why are we constantly
[1:25:56] saying god i did this
[1:25:58] i fell short here i did this feeling
[1:26:00] sorry for ourselves and god
[1:26:02] you're saying something to god that he
[1:26:03] don't know anything about
[1:26:06] god don't understand that from you
[1:26:09] god wants you to get the same image in
[1:26:12] your mind
[1:26:13] that he has in his
[1:26:17] that's the way this bride's gonna get
[1:26:18] out of here when this bride gets the
[1:26:20] same image
[1:26:21] of who she is
[1:26:25] i'm clean i'm spotless i'm perfect
[1:26:30] i'm unblameable nothing i did in my past
[1:26:33] said
[1:26:33] no one can blame me for that if god says
[1:26:37] you didn't do it
[1:26:39] who is greater than god who is any
[1:26:42] greater
[1:26:44] and then we sit there and we waller in
[1:26:46] our sins things we did in the past
[1:26:48] i've said it here before if you bring up
[1:26:51] your past you have to reach into hell
[1:26:52] and pull it out
[1:26:54] because that's where god put it when you
[1:26:57] ask forgiveness for something
[1:26:58] god throws in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:27:00] he sends it back to hell where it came
[1:27:01] from
[1:27:03] then you want to go dig the old man out
[1:27:05] of hell
[1:27:07] and put him on a breathing machine
[1:27:09] that's what we do
[1:27:14] but god said get the image that i had in
[1:27:17] you
[1:27:17] i promise you when everybody and every
[1:27:19] member of this bride gets the image that
[1:27:21] god has of them in in their soul
[1:27:23] we're leaving nothing's going to keep
[1:27:26] her
[1:27:27] you know why we let's go ahead and stand
[1:27:31] it's a life that comes with it there's
[1:27:34] something about that life that
[1:27:35] recognizes life
[1:27:37] god recognizes that life of himself and
[1:27:39] you
[1:27:41] just the spoken word look at elizabeth
[1:27:44] whenever mary come to her and spoke the
[1:27:47] word to her
[1:27:48] but brahman said the spoken word and
[1:27:50] john leaped in her womb who was dead
[1:27:53] it's a life that recognizes life
[1:28:10] we're no different we're no different
[1:28:14] you might not be a prophet you may not
[1:28:16] be a preacher
[1:28:18] but you're exactly what god wants you to
[1:28:20] be you're exactly where god wants you to
[1:28:23] be
[1:28:24] you know you i never understand why
[1:28:27] people want to preach
[1:28:30] i i never unders never understood it
[1:28:32] ever since i
[1:28:34] that i felt the calling in my life it
[1:28:37] just
[1:28:37] blows my mind if people want to preach
[1:28:41] but i'm where god wants me to be if i
[1:28:44] preach once a year once
[1:28:45] three years once every five years that
[1:28:47] makes no difference to me
[1:28:49] i'm exactly where god wants me to be
[1:28:57] if we ever realize
[1:29:00] the life that is in us
[1:29:04] it doesn't matter what satan throws at
[1:29:06] us covet
[1:29:08] cancer depression bitterness
[1:29:13] it doesn't matter what kind of sickness
[1:29:15] what kind of disease
[1:29:17] we've got nothing to worry about
[1:29:20] everything
[1:29:21] i was talking about the oak tree earlier
[1:29:23] everything in your life
[1:29:26] everything that you have in your life in
[1:29:27] the in the life of that new man
[1:29:29] you're victorious over it you've got
[1:29:30] nothing else to worry about
[1:29:33] you know look look at if you look at
[1:29:35] anybody seen the
[1:29:37] the message the brother tim pruitt just
[1:29:40] preached and showed the x-rays
[1:29:42] lady in his church he put up two x-rays
[1:29:44] i watched it last night
[1:29:46] he put two x-rays up side by side this
[1:29:48] lady this whole lung
[1:29:50] entire lung was black with cancer
[1:29:53] she came to church when prayed for went
[1:29:54] and got an x-ray and it's all gone every
[1:29:56] bit of it
[1:29:57] and the cancer took almost her whole
[1:29:58] lung
[1:30:02] that comes from the life that's the end
[1:30:03] the life
[1:30:05] healing is in the life if you've got
[1:30:07] cancer
[1:30:09] you got healing it's already there it's
[1:30:12] already done
