gone back in bring them in bring them in bring them in from the fields of he there little ones to Jes that a beautiful little thing praise the Lord let's bow our hands together heavenly father as we stand before you today we're so grateful for the gift of life never ceases is to amaze us as Mortals how that life can come about but we were here today and we were the richest person in the world we had everything a person could ever want and yet life was taken from us what good would all that do so really what is the greatest gift money Treasures houses or life so today this father and mother want to bring their little daughter back into your presence to give her back to you you shared her little life with them help them father I pray to be able to instill in her the ways of God they don't come with a manual but you give us one Lord It's Your word so we bring her to you today would you keep her from the evils of the age if time would ter that her heart would be so sensitive toward the light of God when she's young the prophet tells us he would have given his heart to you when he was young but there was a spirit that kept him from it dear God be with her I pray keep her from the evils of the age the darkness that so around us help her mother The Fifth Gospel help her father the strength the stability of the home to be able to raise her Lord in a way that's pleasing to you we dedicate our little life to you today for a life of service in the name of the Lord Jesus amen baby let's Stand Together what a great thing children are I find it so amazing that our nation and the state that it's in financially terrible shape all types of things that are going on in the nation and yet by the way politics are going the most important thing today in many of the elections to many people are abortion it's not how much you're paying for gas it's not how high groceries are the most important thing is they're polling people as they come out of the exit poles and the way that they're voting it's so a woman can have a right to murder her baby that tells us where we are for friends we would have never thought our nation would have ever come to a place to where it is in so many ways we can see all the protest around different cities of America and around the world and people that are protesting for baby murderers Hamas I'm talking about can you imagine a human being taking a baby a live one turning up a gas oven and sticking a live baby a turkey I could see a ham a chicken a baby do you understand that's what happened to Israel just over a month ago taking babies and sticking them in the ovens cutting baby feet off decapitating human beings it's bad enough for them to do it and we've got hundreds and thousands of people all over the world they're saying they've got a right to do so and what's really sad about it is many of those people do not realize that if Sharia law would ever gain it won't we know that but if it would ever gain World dominance do you understand what the leaders of amas have said Israel is only the beginning they want to annihilate every Christian right right every one of them every Christian every Jew every homosexual you're a walking dead man or a dead woman you understand whenever Muhammad was convinced he took up for the Jews initially anybody ever read the Quran I've got one he called them the people of the book that was so until he went to Medina when he goes to Medina and meets with the Jews he's totally convinced they're going to receive him as a prophet and whenever he goes there the Jews say you're a false prophet cuz you ain't saying what Moses said you ain't saying what Jeremiah said oh my that's what started the conflict of the Muslims with the Jews why is it why is it they're the most hated people that have ever lived on the face of the Earth somebody say Amen well it's also the same way with the bride of Christ she's the most hated of all the religious that there is in the world but I'm so glad that there's a people that still got the right mind praise the Lord you know how blessed you are to be able to disagree with somebody and not want to kill them murder them praise the Lord that was my greeting to you today how y'all [Music] doing let's turn to the Book of Luke if you would today luk Luke chapter 8 verse 11 I love this Parable it's phenomenal Parable um May the Lord help us today as we look into his word Luke 8 8:1 now the parable is this the seed is the word of God those by the wayside or they that hear then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts my goodness can you imagine a being that is so strong that a person can hear the truth and the word falls down into their hearts and the devil will come and actually take that word right out of their hearts but I want you knows Jesus when he interprets this Parable he does not say takes it out of people's Souls yeah only their hearts lest they should believe and be saved they on the Rock are they which when they hear receive the word with joy these people want to step further so they heard the word and they said that's awesome that is so good that's so wonderful oh I'm I'm going to I'm going to change my ways this is what I want now notice what can happen to when they hear receive the word with joy these have no root which for a while believe how many have we seen down through the years and in time of Temptation fall away that which fell among the Thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring forth no fruit to Perfection I want you notice these now the devil doesn't exactly take it out of them completely but they just never become a fruitful Christian they hold a profession but they don't have it any fruit to Perfection verse 15 I hope every person here today is verse 15 am but that on the good ground that in amazing Jesus does not differentiate between the seed what he differentiates between is the ground where the seed landed not the seed but where the seed landed but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word notice what they do now so they hear it and they keep it and bring forth fruit with patience praise the Lord so they hear it they keep it and they bring forth fruit with patience so even even fruit bearing is not enough it has to be fruit bearing with patience so I'd like to speak to you this morning for a little bit on a life filled with patience and may love to be remembered today heavenly father as we approach you Lord Jesus it's been said now for millennium that the Lord is coming it's been said in sermons and songs it's been talked about by millions and millions of people for the last 2,000 years Jesus is going to come back but we believe we are closer than any other generation to that actually happening we look about us we see the signs everywhere we see the spiritual Darkness that's upon the Nations the gross darkness that is upon the people father we are so grateful for the evening light that was promised to be here may you help each of us today father as the word Goes Forth may it land on good ground Lord Jesus may we bring forth that word with patience may fruit come out of our lives fruit that will produce a body change help me to get out of the way Lord I need you speak through us your words of life I pray in Jesus name and the Saints said amen amen God bless you you may be seated what a great thing patience is how many's got a whole bunch of it [Music] and he's got a little a little bit I was standing not long ago at the Carter County Bank and the lady there that was waiting on me said you have to excuse me preacher it's what she calls me preacher cuz uh we've got a lot going on today and uh I'm I'm pretty impatient now this is a Christian woman and uh I said well you know what the Bible says don't ma'am and she said well about what and I said about patience I said the Bible says tribulation worketh patience patience experience experience hope and hope maketh not asham because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us but whenever I was talking to her another teller walked up and said what did you just say so I went back to that verse again in Romans and quoted it her again well there's another one come over and one wanted to hear the same thing so I had a little Bible teaching there at the cter county bank and she said the lady I was talking to initially said oh Lord I'm not sure I need to ask for patience more then but really patience is not something that we will get by asking for it it's not something like healing or another petition that we place before God and we say God I need patience and then tomorrow it's in the mail or next week God actually just lets it drop out of Heaven to you but patience is one of the Divine Graces that come from the attributes of God which is something molded deep within the child of God by their walk the Holy Ghost comes of of course we know by us receiving him and him actually receiving us he seals us to the day of our Redemption healing can be instantaneous many things God can do for us that are instant but patience is not one of them patience is something that comes by testing and trying the Lord Jesus knowing now the gospel is going to be sown Luke writes this a little bit different than Matthew does as far as the parable but I love the way that Luke words it in that he picks the category of the earth and he shows how that people will able to hear he give us many parables about the seed that was going to be sown he likened it to a fisherman that would go out and cast a big net and whenever the fisherman would go to drawing in he had no idea what I was in the net but they would just start pulling it and they would pull and Pull and then they' pull them in the boat they would find eels they would find all types of things that by the levitical law Jews could not eat so they would throw them back in they couldn't eat an eel throw it back in shellfish throw it back in all kinds of things they could not eat so he likened the gospel and the kingdom to being like a fisherman so whenever he spoke in Parables and it must have been very confusing to some because the Bible says even the disciples when they were along with Jesus they said what does this mean we we don't understand so is the setting of Luke 8 so they asked Jesus what did you mean by this because he said the Kingdom of Heaven is liken unto a sour so a s one forth to sew his sea so you imagine now this is the way they did it in their day they would take him by hand and they would sew the seed so they'd walk about and they would sew the seeds here and there Jesus knew they were all aware of that so he said that's the way you're fixing to start preaching preaching is like that so you will start sewing the seed now you don't know who is there you don't know who's got good ground and who don't that ain't none of your business you just seow so you're going to go out and you're going to start sewing and there'll be some my they'll respond they'll say praise God I've been searching and looking my whole life for an answer to all my problems and a lot of people are and they will hear that and it does something to them and it really moves and they say my goodness I believe this is the this is the answer to all of my life's problems and they'll receive it some of them and others of them it lays right there oh I've heard that all my life I've heard about religion I've heard this and that and while they're pondering over it and thinking about it the birds will fly over and the birds will see it so the bird gets his eye on that seed and he goes down and he picks it right up from the person before they ever walk out the door and they walk out the door what' you think about the service I've heard that before man I ain't got time for no religion I know some of them people that go to that church there's Hypocrites that go there we don't deny that but we're hoping they'll get saved we don't deny it you don't let that stop you from going to Walmart do you well if you go to Walmart there Hypocrites there some of you is going to go to restaurant after a while you're going to be served by gay people is that going to stop you from eating you're going to be served by Hypocrites and Devils is that going to stop you no it's the same way about coming to the house of God there's there's ill people that walk through them doors there's some sad people that walk through them doors but there's some good people that walk through them doors too so the thing of it is are you going to let what we're handing out be hindered by the people that come in or are you going to say I'm going there not to take count of the Hypocrites I'm not going there to watch this one or that one I'm going there to be changed myself that's the way we need to look at it now some whenever they hear it you know they just don't it doesn't really spark hard anything at all others Jesus said they'll hear it and they'll receive the word as Matthew says Anon Anon with joy and M they are so happy and it actually starts doing something for them and they'll let things go they'll let go of this and that I had a terrible temper I had a really bad habit and God changed me and boy they're just so happy and people can look around and say can you get over him can you get over her how she is so changed and then Trouble Comes tribulation comes and they say I didn't realize being a Christian was going to be so hard I didn't know people would laugh at you I didn't know that you'd go through trials and tests like this before well I'll tell you you will you see the devil is the type of King that wants everyone to come into his kingdom but what he does he hides their Destiny he hides the end result if Satan would be honest and show every one of us five minutes in the regions of the Lost we would feel the darkness penetrating our souls we would hear the screams the hollers the crying of the Damned and the doomed and we would see them demon Spirits haunting people and as you arrive they come up to you and go oooo and you're looking for Mama but but there ain't no Mama you're looking for Daddy and there ain't no Daddy if he would let us see just a couple of minutes I guarantee you this altar would be filled with people but he ain't going to show you that he wants to keep the end result of your choice in choosing him away from you until it's too late but you see the Lord Jesus ain't like that Jesus will let you know if you come after me people's going to hate you if you come after me people will make fun of you people will despise you you know why he has nothing to hide the Lord Jesus wants you to know that you'll be name will be cast out as evil people will make fun of you in life because he wants you to serve him with all of your heart but he wants you to know this is not the easy way this is the straight and the narrow and that's what makes the people of God so out understanding they look at Satan and his choices and they see that he's hiding the real he's hiding the real depths of what they will get Satan hides that from his people but the Lord Jesus shows them exactly many of the things of life and yet they choose and he said oh I love them so much they chose me in spite of all the things I told them would come their way but Satan can't do that but you see the Lord set forth and finally he brings the last category into this Parable and that was those that would be able to receive the seed word in the good ground of their hearts now he said on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart I wonder how in the world that's even possible since the same Lord Jesus said there is none good no non one how in the world could he say anybody would have an honest and a good heart unless the power of transformation had already started working on their heart and it was a soil that was predetermined to receive the seed now that within itself was wonderful but I want you to notice how it goes on which in an honest and a good heart having heard the word now that part doesn't make them any different than the rest of the people but they heard it and they kept it unlike the person that the birds come through picked it up unlike the other person that they received it for a while and then the things of the world got in the way and the other stage of the people that the pleasures of life The Riches of Life the things of life and you know he didn't say that the birds took it but actually the weeds choked it out so the weeds are the difficulties of life and the trials and the things you go through through and the weeds grew up and grew up and got bigger and bigger and stronger and stronger and actually wrapped their tentacles as it were around the word and begin to choke the very life right out of the word and before long that person said I don't know what's happened to me I used to love to go to church I used to love to read my Bible and I used to love to pray but seemed like I just don't I don't find pleasure in it anymore more it ain't no wonder the things of Life have choked out the word and the word is and the word dies in their hearts but Jesus said this category of people hear it and they keep it they go to church of course and and they get hold on so the preacher gets up there and he goes to grubbing around a little bit over here and he'll grub around a little bit over there and you know a lot of folks don't mind that as long as he's grubbing around you or you just don't touch them now every one of us need to be grubbed around don't we why because it's just something about nature wonder who puts Miracle Grow on the morning glories wonder who puts Miracle Grow on all the weeds of you that have a garden isn't it amazing you till it you you disc it you do everything and you plant the rose and you put your h on beans and you put your sweet corn and your maters and your ters and your watermelons and all that out of there and then you go to look in and there wasn't nothing out there and all of a sudden here come Johnson grass and here come this grass and that grass and you're out there a chopping and a hoing and a carrying on who in the world Waters them who in the world puts that Miracle Grow on them and makes them grow it's actually in the dirt itself and yet if you don't take care of that you have just wasted your money and buying them seeds you've wasted your money and planting them is that right so if you're going to get a garden you're going to have to work at it right it's the same way with our walk with God but many folks want God to do it all and they say well that's why we pay the preacher so the preacher can do the praying and the preacher can do this and that and the other well I do that I do pray I do read my Bible I study I do what I can to bring you the fruit of the word of God but if you don't chop around your own life as well it ain't going to do you a whole lot of good but this category of people what they do they hear the word and they keep the word and they bring forth fruit now what is the fruit the fruit is the stage of the word once it comes into fruition in other words it does not stay there in Word form you see a life lived by the word is the word expressed so the Lord Jesus didn't come to the Earth just so that he could have a bunch of Bibles that would be published and would hand out Bibles to everybody and then everybody that would have a Bible would be the word made manifest that's not the way it works it's actually when you hear the word you receive the word then the word comes into your soul and becomes quickened by the power of God then when it does does that word transforms and changes itself into the fruit stage of the word not many people all they do is read the word listen tapes read your Bible whatever it is and they discuss it and they talk about it and they just go on and on and on how wonderful the word is but it's never changed from word stage to fruit stage so what is the fruit the manifestation of that promised word that lives out in a human human being's life and somebody said that's what he's coming for is when the word becomes fruit just like you if you only want two or three grains of corn why plant your garden why not just eat the seeds that you do why not eat your high rer bean seeds why do you do that cuz you want more don't you so you take one little pack and you plant a row and another row and another row because you want more that's what God wanted God did not want just one perfect son if he did he should have never let the Lord Jesus die but the Lord Jesus came so that he could plant a row and another row and another row and another row and bring forth Sons and Daughters of God all over the Earth which is exactly what's happening then with that notice the way Jesus says it that they will bring forth fruit with patience now what is patience well you know people look at and say well I I'm a man of very great patience it it runs as a nature in my family well that's not the patience we're talking about some people are truly more patient than others but this is not nature given by the natural births it is actually something that is cultured and grown by God himself but God doesn't use blessings to do it God does not use just signs wonders and miracles even though we believe in that but yet patience does not come by Miracles patience does not come by healing or by shouting or by rejoicing it comes by tests notice the prophet mentions this about about Noah in the Statue of a perfect man he said Noah had patience yeah Noah had real Godly patience God said I'm going to destroy this world with rain Noah preached 120 years at it plenty of patience he said not even do fell from heaven wasn't nothing just as Dusty As It Ever Was for 120 years but he was patient don't notice patience now Godly patience that Noah said it's going to rain and he does it for 120 years and after that 120 years it was just as dry as it was when Noah first started notice he said what God will do now just as dust As It Ever Was for 120 years but he was patient then God tries your patience so for 120 years God is working on this man's patience so no results nobody got saved other than his family nobody come oh if they did come they'd laugh at him make fun of him but had no converts at all not one so he has his sons and his sons wives and that's all that's the very ones he started with so so he didn't really wind up with anymore than what he started so with patience he preaches and preaches now remember he's he's building this big boat too so he's working and he's preaching and he's preaching and he's working so what is God doing God is building this man's patience now building and trying a patience is not even the same thing so God is building his patience now God's going to try his patience now watch this he says actually told I want you to go ahead and get in the ark I'm going to run the animals in there and I want you to get in climb way upstairs now so you can look at the top window now I want you to get in there what he tell these people tomorrow I've been preaching for 120 years it's going to take place now what's God doing so for seven days he sets inside the ark what's that for God trying his patience to see if Noah will lose patience in the promised word of the message of the hour cuz it seems like nothing has happened except he's built this great big gigantic boat and now he's got all them animals in there with him and when he got in God shut the door no he didn't shut the door the animals didn't shut the door God shut the door and he sat there day one day two day three on through day seven so what is God doing for seven days he is now trying the patience of this man that already proved that he had patience but patience that cannot be tried is not deemed Godly praise the Lord notice David in Psalms 37:7 rest in the Lord and wait patiently for him I love the way that the writers of the scripture would do and they would State a fact and then they would kind of go to a paradoxical side of it in other words they would come with something that would be contrasting this is what David does rest in the Lord and wait patiently for him fret not thyself because of him who prosper in his way now watch what patience will do patience will look at the promise of God and it will wait on God to be able to fulfill his word and while you may be going through hard times in your life and struggling you look around at the wicked and you can see that the wicked seem to have it a lot easier than you do as a child of God David made faced this so many times and he said look at the ungodly how can the ungodly Prosper the way they do he said they spread forth their leaves as a Green Bay Tree and he said look at the righteous how they go through such difficulty and David this question was still unanswered by the time that David comes here but he's found a little bit of inside to be able to say rest in the Lord and wait pay patiently for him threet not thyself because of him who prosperes in his own way now notice what David saw he saw a servant of God that loved the Lord and the Lord wouldn't let him go this way or that way couldn't do as he pleased had to obey the Lord and seemed like he had such a hard time but he watched The Wicked and they could do whatever they wanted to do and it seemed like they prospered every way they turned they was never tried they was never tested it seemed like whatever they touched was just blessed and David said God I don't understand I don't understand but he come to at least this recognition that we have to wait patiently on the Lord how many needs help to wait patiently on the Lord Psalm 40 and one to the chief musician a Psalm of David I waited patiently for the Lord he inclined unto me and heard My Cry notice how patience now is tied to a son or daughter of God waiting for an answer a manifestation of a real need in your life and you're crying and you're praying and it seemed like God is not hearing you again New Testament Luke CH 21: 19 what a Paramount scripture this is in your patience possess ye wow your souls in your patience notice Jesus doesn't say in my patience but in your patience possess ye your souls this is one of your rights children to have a life full of Godly patience I know it's hard on us we got instant coffee we got instant potatoes we got instant warm-up meals from microwaves we got instant drive-thru and you know how them are they ain't instant either you just get to a place to where you tell them go ahead and give me what you want to you're gone to anyway he go s and get a Big Mac and you get a Burger King Whopper you think how in the world is that possible for McDonald's you order a ham and egg biscuit and they wind up giving you a bone and cheese I mean you saying how in the world could this happen but God has a way of trying his people in an instant fast age so a man gets saved today by next week he feels like he's called to preach and he wants to start him a church huh a man sings In A Honky Tonk one week and next week he gets saved and we get him up on the platform and let him start singing and picking his guitar don't even let him be tried a little bit come on don't get quiet on me and yet we realize God has not changed at all in the way that he makes Christians God still makes Christians the same way that he made the first one the slow tried process and boy it's hard pardon us lay of sins now watch in your PA patience possess ye your soul now this is the way you and I are going to possess our souls by patiently bearing all afflictions reproaches indignities shame humiliation persecution let nothing disturb or distress you even when God will say no and you ask him fervently God I need this God please move this way please God and yet sometimes God will say yes sometimes God says no and sometimes God says wait a while oh I never did like that word I find it amazing you have a doctor's appointment at 10:00 in the morning at 10:15 you're still sitting there watching at 10:20 you're watching now don't raise your hands but how many of you by 10:30 have already gotten mad and left the doctor office but it depends on how sick you are some of you would sit there as Carol and I did a while ago not too long back to where that we went to see a heart doctor you know just to get a checkup and all that sort of thing 30 minutes passed 45 minutes passed an hour passed an hour and a half past they finally come out and said you know what we've had a little bit of delay y'all want to reschedule we said well we done cleaned up and dressed up we might as well just wait so we sat there and waited and waited but I thought I wonder how many people would be willing to wait on a preacher to talk to him that long they'd get mad at a hornet and go to another church while I tried to talk to him for 5 minutes and he was so busy he wouldn't even have time but the real people of God are an example of divine patience because they will knock and they will knock come on somebody say Amen a real son or daughter of God but puts their need and their situation and their problems into the hands of Jesus and they tell him Lord I hope you like looking at my face because I ain't leaving until I get what I have needed if I get it today that's fine if I don't get it today I'll get it next week but however long it takes is exactly what I'm going to do now want you notice in so there's something about Divinity that God Blends into the measuring and the making of this type of thing why because God himself is called the god of patience is that amazing he's not called the god of money he's not called the god of many things that we love and many things that we fill our lives with yet he's called in the Bible the god of patience so there is a Godly patience that we must have acts 14: 211 and when they had preached the gospel to that City and it taught many they returned again to lisra and to Iconium and Antioch confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith now listen to the apostolic way that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God notice the word tribulation the lipsus Affliction trouble anguish pressing pressing together pressure how many feels pressure in the age we're living or press and distress so you mean this is the way we enter into the kingdom of God well where's the easy believism that is so preached among so many in the day that we live in that you just do whatever you want to do and well if you want to go to church it's okay if you don't it don't really matter you know if you want to live right it don't really matter where does that come from from the Bible that is not in the Bible notice now this is what the apostolic Doctrine was in the book of Acts so look at it again maybe on Wednesday night confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God Romans 5:3 and not only so but we Glory oh my goodness we glory in Tribulation how many needs help how many needs help with this scripture not only so but we glory in Tribulation also knowing that tribulation worketh patience so what is patience in endurance under trials without sustaining loss or deterioration urance under trials without sustaining loss or under deterioration so in other words it's when you and I are going through something that is so trying oh but that's my faith yes Faith coupled with patience Faith believes he will move but patience will wait it out right you see people can lose their faith and they don't understand why it's because they don't emphasize and realize the importance of patience coupled together with faith what is faith faith is the substance of things so forth the evidence of Things Not Seen but we must have patience coupled with faith in order to bring a during promise to pass now what happens many people will begin to deteriorate they ask God oh God I need this God I want that God please move and they ask and they ask and they think well what in the world happened I don't understand what's going on well maybe God is trying your patient now you see it's not so much for God's benefit it's for our own it's to help us to see either we don't have much or we've got a little and he wants us to have much and the test is the only thing that will tell you wouldn't it be so nice that this morning each of us could walk up on a patience scale we'd walk up and we'd plant our feet we'd stand right there and now stand still and then the needle goes up and said wo wow you're about to blow the needle oh my goodness or I wonder if we would walk up on it and the needle barely moved and the needle said was that a fly that come through was that a speck of dust and then Dr God says now tell what I'm going to do I'm going to write you a script we're a script age aren't we I'm going to write you a script go by Walgreens CVS wherever it is and you just pick this up it should be done within 30 minutes or so you take these three times a day and by the end of 30 days I promise you you will have so much patience why your wife can burn your toast every day she can fry your eggs when she knows you don't want them fried you don't want them over easy you want and it won't even bother you the kids will raise their voice the preacher will Stomp all over your toes and you won't even get mad no more Brother Lou will sing a song and he knows you don't like that song and you'll sit right there and before you know it you'll start smiling like a posle and you'll go to in your hand glory to God I love that song I love that song within 30 days you will have the most abundance of patience you've ever seen in your life how we wish but instead God looks at us and said Brad Gilbert you need more patience Paul Arwood oh you've got that million dollar smile but you ain't got near enough patience boy so God will let trouble and difficulty of course you know what trouble does to us praying people we pray we pray more yes don't we we we pray more we ask God for more and we ask God for his help and his intervention and then we look at where we are and we think God what's a matter with me I've asked and I've asked and I've asked in faith believe you is there a reason Lord there's something in my life it's the second phase the coupling together of your faith with your patience God is trying you to see will you lose some of what you have if he stretches it out and he doesn't answer as soon as you thought and what's amazing is he may answer somebody else's prayer n the same prayer and they'll get it so soon and they don't even live half as good as you do as a matter of fact I sat the other day talking to a businessman he was telling me about Erica's funeral he went to our website saw the service complimenting the ministers and the service and never seen anything like it never heard anything like it he said then I went to your website and I heard the C you preached on why and he went to tell me that he had a brother that had passed with Co and there was another preacher that had come to their Church his brother was a pastor actually and there was a preacher that come to their church and this preacher also had coid but he lived and they said he sister-in-law which heard the testimony of this man that God moved for and he throwed her in one of the greatest battles of her life because his testimony brought a negative reaction to her and she couldn't understand if God would heal that man why didn't heal her husband why did God take her husband which was also a preacher and let this man live so you see whenever we don't understand things it can certainly try our patience and we're waiting and we're waiting and if you're not careful you'll find yourself almost resentful toward God for healing this person of this situation and you had a dear friend that died with the same thing yeah and then you go to questioning you see what's happening is that under this your face is deteriorated your patience is actually breaking up and you're struggling because why you don't understand but you see faith will hold on even when your understanding is unfruitful right somebody said amen and we will sustain loss during this so This is actually the word that Paul used was a metaphor that was used for refining Metals gold silver brass bronze I mean know that all these things come from where they come from the earth then they found it out many many years ago the metallurgical value of brass and iron and tin and gold and silver and it all comes from the Earth but it it doesn't just lay there pure gold by itself it doesn't lay there uranium titanium you know there's a big silicon mine over here in North Carolina which is one of the purest in the entire world a but hour and a half or so from here and yet whenever they go in that and find all of that they still have to run it through a purification process it's that but it's mixed up with Earth I believe a lot of y'all got love Mercy kindness Grace forgiveness all of that thing but that Purity is mixed up with your humanity and it dilutes the purity of what we have by how much Humanity that we have left so what do they have to do they have to run it through a process and then each time they run it through the process it makes it more cure you've heard me tell about the Gold Mine The Carol and I saw years ago in South Africa and they're in that gold mine they had the same amount of gold and they would heat it up and it would become more pure each time they would heat it up it took out more draw and more draw and more dross each time God lets us go through something it's actually taking more impurities out and letting the real genuine shine more how many wants that with all your heart amen how how many wants to process notice what Paul says now not only so but we glory in Tribulation also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope now look at the coupling together of this train so it's like you've got one car hooked to another hooked to another now you just say well there's the engine that's the train no that's not the complete train well the Caboose that's that's the that's the last sign that's not the complete train one hook to another to another to another patience and experience and experience hope and hope make us not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad on our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us so experience Hope Oh all those things are wonderful but notice where it comes so tribulation worketh patience it doesn't create it it doesn't make it it works it it works it so you got a guy that goes into the gym he's getting a little bit pudgy a little bit of fly up hanging off there so his wife buys him a monthly admission into the local gym so he goes in there and he sees them guy sitting there Welly they can bench press how much ever this other guy walks in there say if they can do her I can do her so he reaches down there 175 lb I'll be back next week stopping at the drugstore on his way back home to buy some anal jesic and you see that's so a many new Converse where they come to the Lord oh hallelujah hallelujah I'll reach down there boy I've beenal maybe I should start out with 5 lbs so what do you do you work up to it so you start taking whatever you start and you goodness gracious I didn't realize that could be so bad and you do it again and you make another trip to church I mean to the gym come on and you're hearing and you're hearing and you're getting stronger and stronger and say hey I'm pretty good by that 15 pounder now I'm really going to take a jump 17 and a half I'm going to really jump up and then before you know it 20 25 5050 or whatever it is and it's the same way with tribulation it works that it works it like a muscle and our spiritual mechanism that God gives us as the people of God so tribulation worketh patience patience experience experience hope hope make us not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad on our Holy Ghost but yet many people in this age don't want that I need patience order and I want it now Romans chapter 8 ver 24 for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why does he yet hope for but if we hope for that we see n now remember hope is Faith's little sister but don't you do away with her she's still part of the family of God the Bible tells us about Abraham in Hebrews against hope he believed in Hope notice it he says for if we hope for that which we see not then do we wish what about faith faith and patience should be coupled together to make the chain you see hope is more than just something that might exist it's something that you know it's a valid claim supported by faith don't go away with hope to keep that which you've committed to the Lord against that day notice again in Romans 15:4 for whatsoever things were written a four time were written for our learning that we through patience patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope watch how these things link patience and comfort will help produce hope we want it all in one package get every bit of it at once God says nope I ain't never made a Christian like that I ain't going to start making one now I'm going to make mine the same way now notice Romans 15:5 now the god of patience and consolation Grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus that you may have one mind and one mouth glorify God even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ what a great thing it is to have a life filled with patience praise God second Corinthians 6:4 but in all things approving ourselves as the Ministers of God in much patience in afflictions in Necessities in distresses Colossians 1:11 strengthen with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness how many can shout when you're under such burdens how many tends to complain how many tends to gripe and Grumble and I don't understand why what have I done well that's that's where most of us are that's where we fit this is why we need this to help us oh my thank you Lord God 2 Thessalonians chapter 1:4 so that we ourselves glory in you in the Churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure remember 2 Thessalonians is written around 55 to 60 AD they were cutting their heads off remember in the time of Nero he had all these vast gardens around his Palace and they would dip Christians and Pitch tar t a r pitch wrapped them in sheep's clothes they said well Jesus heus said that they were sheep so they would put fleece around them Christians and pour that tar pitch on their bodies on that wool and set them on fire and neero would walk through his garden at night looking at all his plants and all of his flowers and all of his trees not lit up by electric lights but lit up by the saints of God being on fire your brothers and sisters and Paul write to them could you imagine a preacher trying to find words of comfort preaching that God is a loving God preaching that God is a merciful god M gives it a little bit different view doesn't it so that we ourselves glory in the Churches of God for your patience so they'd find a woman that was pregnant carrying her baby and they'd take their knives and rip her belly open as a moss did just a few weeks ago and pull the baby out and dash its head against a stone and kill it Lord God Hebrews 6:12 that you be not slothful but followers of them notice followers of of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise and yet when Sarah died you know how much property Abraham had none he went to the field in the cave there was a cave there in the field Cave of matpa which means the cave of two mouths God promised him the whole land I'll give it all to you and yet when the man died the only thing he had in possession was a cemetery but Paul identifies it and he said he obtained the promise well you couldn't prove it by title go down to courthouse and search how many land Parcels does Abraham own Abraham Abraham Abraham Abraham oh yeah the sons of H yeah the sons of H sold him this this cave there and exorb price you compare the price of what they sold it to compared to the hurian text which they uncovered years and years ago it was an exorb amount not the way Abraham looked at it because by Revelation he found out job was buried there and the only piece of ground the man owned was a cemetery but Paul said he obtained it yeah Oh Glory to God I remind you again in case some of you are wondering my daughter Erica obtained the promise Amen brother Junior Davis obtained the promise others that we have prayed for obtain the promise Man car was talking about coming to church and I told her I said she did not lose the devil lost the devil lost it was not us as the children of God we obtain the promise Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise notice let me close with this Hebrews 10:36 for you have need of patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise so you think you mean actually believed I we've had faith faith believes he can and believes he will but patience couple will facei will say I'm going to wait until it happens CU I have Godly patience let's Stand Together Hebrews 12 verse1 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every wait and the sin which just so easily beset us and let us run with patience with patience the race that is set before us Hebrews 13:21 make you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ to whom be glory forever and ever amen James 1 three knowing this that the trying of your faith work us patience but you see if somehow we look at patience and think what do you need patience for I've got faith I've got faith but the trying of your faith actually works patience and brings it to the stage of fulfillment how many Christians here today been asking God for something healing for your body salvation for a loved one for a long time long time maybe some of you asking for healing some of you asking for the Holy Ghost some maybe asking for a husband a wife a son or daughter don't think faith alone will bring it but patience patience coupled with your faith notice James says in verse four but let patience have her I find this so amazing that he designates patience in the feminist gender now remember the prophet tells us about faith that faith has hair on his chest which ain't a woman if it does she's really weird but look at little weak patience but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect now this is not sinlessness but it's Tios the Greek word Tios which means fully matured lacking nothing don't you understand how people can have faith that God can heal but they don't have patience to endure child training how many people have I prayed for brother Daryl prayed for these other brothers have prayed for through the years that we've been here and they would come and get a great miracle brother R spener was tell me not long ago of one of the greatest Miracles he ever seen in his ministry and it was at a woman and a hospital and they called him to pray for the woman wasn't saved the woman wasn't wasn't serving the lord in the light of the hour and he goes in and they give her just a few hours to live and he prays for him what he's praying for God shows him a vision he sees this woman walking down the hallway and he tells him by a certain time she'll be out of here the nurse said sir do you understand this woman's dying he said I didn't say that the Lord's one told me that by the next day the exact time that he said so it happened that woman still ain't serving God yet she had Faith to believe it would happen but patience to endure don't you understand faith alone will not do it we must be coupled with patience how many needs help let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire complete wanting nothing let's Barry it praise the Lord hallelujah now I'm not going to ask how many today wants trouble how many wants tests and trials and none of us want that of course but I do believe all of those of us today that are sincere before the Lord we want to be perfect and entire lacking nothing in our walk how many say Lord help me today help me Jesus Lord God I raise both my hands heavenly father as we bow our heads to the dust of the earth when we come to this world we did not have these Divine things in US Lord when I give my heart to you as a 12-year-old boy little did I know the years and years that it would take in my journey to develop and make these traits father many of these Believers standing here today been saved for decades and that they still probably find themselves ripening and maturing in your presence Lord we don't want just want faith but we want Fai with patience so can we patiently wait while a person is prayed for and healed and we know they don't even live really a consecrated life and others are prayed for that live a better life and live more consecrated than that one does and instead of healing them you take them can we with patience then wait to see them in the resurrection help us Lord I believe Lord Jesus you are working on a people oh I'm sure it's taken you all these years to work on me he here I am a 67y old man been serving you for 55 years oh Lord help me help my facei my hope my patience my endurance no Lord I'm not asking for trials I'm not asking for more but I trust trust your wisdom that you'll allow to come our way what is necessary that our patience can be TR Lord sometimes you answer in a way that is so surprising to us it overwhelms us because you know how we are we have our minds run in a certain direction you're going to do this and this and this and then you do something so different and it it it just it just overwhelms us we don't know what to make of it but we're so glad father that we can say today you are perfect and you've never made a mistake Lord God May every child of God standing here today and those that are stream this service from around the world may we fulfill that scripture in the parable in the Book of Luke that the seed fell on the good ground and out of a good and sincere heart it begin to bring forth fruit fruit with patience Paul catches it of course in James as well and says let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing Lord God more than anything in this world I want to please you Jesus help me that I can be true father how many would say was me today would you just raise your hand Lord I want to please you every day of my life on the job at home raising my family at church I want to please you Lord I want to be patient I want to be patient with my brothers patient with my sisters help me Lord [Music] help me Lord flows through [Music] me I will be that good Samaritan to someone else in he flows through me [Music] Holy Spirit flows through me love through me oh love through [Music] me Spirit loves through me Grant it Lord God Hallelujah Lord Jesus I will be your house to dwell in Lord God love and forgive and reach out to us Lord oh I will be that good Samaran to someone else in need [Music] through me ohy Spirit
