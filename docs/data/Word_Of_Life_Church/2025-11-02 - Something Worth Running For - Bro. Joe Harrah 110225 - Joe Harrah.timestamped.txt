[17:25] Um, this is one of the best days of my
[17:28] life. Can I tell you why
[17:31] &gt;&gt; I get to go to church?
[17:34] [applause]
[17:36] &gt;&gt; Now, that's not the end of it. I have it
[17:39] on good authority that Jesus is coming
[17:42] to our town and he's coming to our
[17:45] synagogue church and he's going to take
[17:47] the word and he's going to read it and
[17:50] then he's going to expound on it. Can
[17:52] you see why I'm so blessed today?
[17:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's wonderful. Let's just go before
[17:56] the Lord. Lord, it'd be different if we
[18:00] if we'd be different if we was just
[18:02] going to church and that would be
[18:04] wonderful. But Lord, you come you come
[18:07] to our church. You you take the word and
[18:11] and you expound it upon your lips and
[18:14] [sighs and gasps]
[18:15] such wonderful things take place.
[18:19] Healing takes place. forgiveness takes
[18:21] place, salvation takes place, mercy.
[18:25] [gasps]
[18:27] Thank you, Lord, for coming to our place
[18:30] today. Lord, we love you so much and so
[18:34] very thankful for the testimonies that
[18:35] you gave out, knowing that you're doing
[18:38] things behind the scenes that we can't
[18:39] even see. But Father, we have these
[18:42] needs today that you knew before we
[18:44] written them on paper with ink that we
[18:47] would have need of them and you'd make a
[18:49] way for them. And all we've got to do is
[18:51] walk in them and believe and be patient
[18:54] and wait on that day that you bring them
[18:55] to pass. Father, [snorts] we thank you
[18:58] so much and for this service and ask you
[19:00] to bless the remainder of it by speaking
[19:02] your word to us of eternal life in Jesus
[19:05] Christ's name. Amen.
[19:11] Brother, you come take the offering.
[19:14] Brothers, if you could put healer of the
[19:15] broken pieces.
[19:18] That's in G.

[19:48] [singing]
[19:50] Sing it.
[19:54] [music]
[19:56] I was [singing] a broken
[20:02] [music] vessel in your hand.
[20:07] You looked [singing] beyond the hurt and
[20:10] made [music] me whole again.
[20:15] [singing]
[20:18] Healer of the broken pieces.
[20:23] [music] You touched my heart and
[20:25] [singing] made it.

[20:35] the mener. Lord, I give my heart to you.

[20:43] Love the song before I [singing]
[20:45] knew you.
[20:48] [music]

[20:52] [singing]
[20:54] [music]
[20:56] Now I live to praise you.
[21:00] Ever may [music and singing] I praise
[21:01] you neither of mine.
[21:08] [music]
[21:12] Nothing compares [singing]
[21:14] Lord
[21:18] [music] to knowing you
[21:24] [music] and seeing [singing] what the
[21:26] grace of God
[21:29] can [music]
[21:30] do.
[21:32] Aren't you glad he faithfully sought
[21:34] you?
[21:37] You [music] faithfully [singing]
[21:38] sought me
[21:42] [music]
[21:43] and called me your own.
[21:49] You [music] made a way to bring
[21:51] [singing] my wondering heart back
[21:54] [music] home.
[21:57] Oh,
[21:59] healer of the broken [music]
[22:01] pieces. [singing]
[22:04] You touch my heart and made [music] you
[22:07] new.
[22:12] I lift you. Lay it [music] down before
[22:16] the men. [singing] Lord, I give my heart
[22:19] to you. [music]
[22:24] Love this song before I knew [music]
[22:29] has brought me [singing] near to where
[22:32] you are
[22:37] now. I live to [music] praise you ever.
[22:41] May I praise you, healer [singing] of my
[22:45] heart, [music]
[22:49] healer of [singing] the broken pieces.
[22:52] [music]
[22:53] Brother Justin, if you'll come get ready
[22:58] [music]
[23:01] now. My whole [singing] life [music] I
[23:03] surrender. Lay it down before the men.

[23:13] [music] Love is on before I [singing]
[23:16] knew.
[23:19] has brought [music] me near to where you
[23:22] [singing] are.

[23:30] every [singing] day. I praise you, the
[23:33] healer of my heart. [singing]
[23:38] [music]
[23:39] Yes. Now I live to praise you.
[23:43] Ever [music and singing] may I praise
[23:44] you, the healer of my heart. [singing]
[23:52] God bless you. You can be seated.
[23:55] [applause] Let's give Brother Justin a
[23:56] good hand.
[24:39] Life is [singing] easy
[24:44] when you're up on [singing]
[24:47] the mountain
[24:49] [music]
[24:52] and you've got peace [music and singing]
[24:54] of mind
[24:58] like you've never [singing]
[25:00] known.
[25:02] [music]
[25:05] But then things [singing]
[25:07] change.
[25:09] &gt;&gt; [music]
[25:11] &gt;&gt; When you're down [singing]
[25:14] in the valley,
[25:19] don't [music and singing]
[25:20] lose faith.
[25:24] For [singing] you're never alone.
[25:29] [music]
[25:31] For the God [singing] on the mountain
[25:37] [music] is still God in the valley.
[25:42] [singing]
[25:45] When [music] things they go wrong,
[25:52] he'll [singing] make them right.
[25:59] And the God of the good
[26:02] times
[26:05] is still God in the bad
[26:09] times.
[26:12] [music]
[26:12] And the God of [singing] the day
[26:19] is still God in the night. [singing]
[26:26] [music] Oh, you talk of victory
[26:33] when you're up on [singing and music]
[26:35] that mountain.
[26:39] Oh, but [music and singing] tall comes
[26:41] so easy
[26:46] when [music] life's [singing] at its
[26:48] best.
[26:51] [music and singing]
[26:53] Oh, but it's down in the valleys
[27:00] of trials and temptations.
[27:03] [singing and music]
[27:07] And that's where faith
[27:12] [music]
[27:13] is put to the test.
[27:20] But I got all the m Mountain [singing]
[27:27] is [music] still God in the valley
[27:31] [singing]
[27:33] [music]
[27:34] when things they go wrong.
[27:40] Oh, he'll make them right. [singing]
[27:46] [music]
[27:47] And the God of the good
[27:51] times [singing]
[27:53] [music] is still God in the bad
[27:57] times.
[28:00] And the God [music and singing] of the
[28:02] day
[28:06] [music] is [singing] still God in the
[28:09] night.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[28:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, [music] the God of the day
[28:18] [music]
[28:20] is still God [singing] in the night.
[28:33] [music]
[29:17] Don't nobody get nervous. I'm nervous
[29:18] enough for all of us.
[29:25] After I said I was going to sing this
[29:27] song, I realized the last song I sung
[29:28] was
[29:30] uh
[29:33] I didn't know better think I was getting
[29:34] old. Something about home.
[29:38] And then I decided I was going to sing
[29:39] almost home.
[29:41] But
[29:43] I guess that just goes to show I think a
[29:45] lot about home.
[29:47] Aren't you glad that this world don't
[29:50] make you happy?
[29:53] I don't see how anybody could look at
[29:56] how our world is falling apart.
[29:59] Just look around us and see what's going
[30:03] people going crazy because they think
[30:05] they're not going to get their food this
[30:06] month and they're stealing going in
[30:10] Walmart walking out with stuff. And
[30:12] that's just a little taste of what it's
[30:15] going to be like when they really can't
[30:16] get
[30:18] the food and whatnot. And it's going to
[30:19] be crazy. And I'm glad we're not going
[30:22] to be here. Aren't you glad we're almost
[30:24] home?
[30:33] Are you disappointed?
[30:37] Are you desperate for help?
[30:42] You know what it's like to be tired and
[30:45] only a shell of yourself.
[30:50] But you start to believe
[30:54] you don't have what it takes
[30:59] cuz it's all you can do just to move
[31:02] [music] much less finish the race.
[31:09] But don't [singing] forget
[31:13] what lies ahead.
[31:17] We're almost [singing]
[31:20] home, brother. It won't be long. Soon
[31:26] all our burdens
[31:29] [music] will be gone. [singing]
[31:35] With all your strength, sisters, run
[31:40] [singing] on, run free. Hold up your
[31:44] head. Keep pressing
[31:49] on. [singing]
[31:51] We are almost home.
[31:56] Well, this road will be hard,
[32:00] but we win in the end
[32:05] simply [music] because it's Jesus in us.
[32:09] It's not if, but when.
[32:13] So [music] take joy in the journey
[32:17] even when it seems [singing] long.
[32:23] Find [music] strength in each step
[32:25] knowing heaven is cheering you on.
[32:30] We are almost
[32:34] home. Brother, it [music] won't be long.
[32:40] All our burdens
[32:43] will be gone. [singing]
[32:49] Oh, with all your [music] strength,
[32:53] sister, run [singing] on, run free. Hold
[32:58] up your head. Keep pressing
[33:02] [singing] on.
[33:05] We are almost home.
[33:10] We're almost home. [singing]
[33:14] We're almost home. [singing]
[33:21] [singing]
[33:24] I know [music] that the cross has
[33:26] brought heaven to us. But make no
[33:30] mistake, there's still [music] more to
[33:32] [singing] come when our flesh and our
[33:34] bones are no longer between. Who we are
[33:38] right now and where we're meant to be.
[33:41] Where [music] all has been lost is made
[33:44] whole again. These tears [music] and
[33:47] this pain no longer exists. No more
[33:50] walking. We're running as fast [music]
[33:53] as we can. Consider this our second way.
[34:01] We're almost
[34:03] home, brother. [music] It won't be long.
[34:09] Soon all our burdens [singing]
[34:12] [music]
[34:12] will be gone. [singing]
[34:17] Oh, with all your strength, [music]
[34:22] sister, run on, run free. Hold up your
[34:27] head. Keep pressing
[34:32] on.
[34:34] We are almost home. [singing]
[34:39] We're almost [music] home.
[34:44] We're almost home.
[34:52] We are almost [music] home.
[34:57] Amen.
[35:01] [applause]
[35:05] &gt;&gt; I believe we're closer than we think.
[35:07] You know, I was thinking back there if
[35:09] Satan has put such a desperation
[35:13] in this world to like he he was saying
[35:16] people going to breaking into stores and
[35:19] you know all the things that that Satan
[35:21] has put a desperation in this world. I
[35:23] believe God's done the same thing. He's
[35:25] put a desperation in a bride to get out
[35:27] of here. And
[35:28] &gt;&gt; you know, that's that should be our main
[35:29] goal. That should be our our main
[35:31] purpose when we come in here on Sundays,
[35:33] Wednesdays, or whatever it is is our
[35:35] purpose should not be to just come see
[35:37] who's preaching,
[35:39] &gt;&gt; but let's get something that'll give us
[35:42] an extra boost out of here.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; You know, I believe that's what God
[35:46] wants for. And I think so many times as
[35:47] humans, we all do it. We we we miss the
[35:50] purpose of why we're here. while we're
[35:52] here congregating together and you know
[35:54] and instead of listening to what a man
[35:56] has to say, let's come in and think,
[35:58] God, what what can I do to bring me that
[36:00] much closer to getting out of here? You
[36:02] know, so I believe that's, you know, if
[36:05] you're true bride, you're going to be
[36:06] desperate. You're going to be desperate
[36:08] to to get out of here. We're we're so
[36:10] close. We're I don't understand people
[36:12] going this long in the journey, 30, 40,
[36:14] 50 years, whatever, and then finally
[36:16] just quitting. I just I don't I don't
[36:18] understand it. But if you have your
[36:20] Bibles, turn to Hebrews 11. This is a
[36:23] very I'm not going to read the whole
[36:24] Hebrews 11. This you you understand this
[36:27] is the uh the faith heroes of faith
[36:31] chapter.
[36:33] So uh we'll start at verse 35 and read
[36:35] down through 40 and then we'll read the
[36:37] first verse of Hebrews 12.
[36:42] Women received their dead raised to life
[36:45] again.
[36:48] Others were tortured, not accepting
[36:50] deliverance, that they might obtain a
[36:52] better resurrection. Others had trial of
[36:55] cruel mockings and scourgings, and yay,
[36:57] moreover, of bonds and imprisonment.
[36:59] They were stoned. They were sus, were
[37:01] tempted, were slain in the sword. They
[37:03] wandered about in sheep skins and goat
[37:05] skins, being destitute, afflicted, and
[37:07] tormented. And I want to ask you today,
[37:09] how was your week?
[37:13] &gt;&gt; This was this was their every day.
[37:17] And God said, "Of the whom the world was
[37:20] not worthy,
[37:22] they wandered in deserts and mountains
[37:24] and dens and caves of the earth. And
[37:26] these all having obtained a good report
[37:29] through faith received not the promise,
[37:32] having God having provided some better
[37:34] thing for us that they without us should
[37:38] not be made perfect."
[37:41] In other words, they're counting on me
[37:43] and you to put on this word to come into
[37:46] the perfection because they can't be
[37:48] perfect without you. Hebrews 12,
[37:52] wherefore, seeing that we also are
[37:54] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[37:56] witnesses, let us lay aside every weight
[37:59] and the sin which doth so easily beset
[38:02] us. Let us run with patience the race
[38:06] that is set before us. Let us pray.
[38:09] Heavenly Father,
[38:11] Lord, we're so grateful, Father, for
[38:13] this word. We're so grateful, Lord, for
[38:15] a promise. We're so grateful for for
[38:17] you, Lord, that what you've placed
[38:18] inside of us is your life, Lord. That's
[38:21] our hope, our faith, Lord, to get out of
[38:24] here, that whenever the world is turned
[38:26] upside down, Father, as we see it
[38:28] happening today, Father, we don't have
[38:29] to be a part of it because we have a
[38:32] hope of something greater, Lord. And in
[38:34] your word, Lord, we we've seen these
[38:35] that have gone on before now through the
[38:37] church ages, Lord. and and even those in
[38:39] in our time in our day that have crossed
[38:41] over. Lord, without us, they can't be
[38:44] made perfect. Lord, help us this morning
[38:47] to to lay aside anything that would
[38:49] would so easily beset us. Help us to run
[38:51] this race, Father, with desperation,
[38:53] with courage, with faith, Lord, and that
[38:56] we may may obtain the promise that
[38:57] you've set before us. Lord, may you
[38:59] anoint the people here this morning.
[39:02] Touch every need. Lord, we see, Lord,
[39:04] that CO's going around again. Father,
[39:06] may you give healing to to everyone,
[39:08] Father. Every need that's here, every
[39:11] every thing that somebody would had in
[39:13] their mind, Lord, with a raised hand or
[39:14] whatever it may be, Lord, we know that
[39:16] you can fulfill that, Lord. Set me
[39:19] aside, Father, that that I could receive
[39:21] from you, Father, as well as they, Lord,
[39:23] because I know, Lord, if I just stand
[39:25] here and try to to give what's on my
[39:27] notes, Lord, it would just follow on on
[39:29] deaf ears, Father. But if you come, we
[39:30] can apply it to our h our lives, Lord,
[39:32] and to our hearts, and we can live by
[39:34] it. We welcome you in Jesus name. Amen.
[39:38] You can be seated.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; This morning [clears throat] I' I'd like
[39:42] to take a thought that
[39:46] Thank you. I actually got this thought
[39:49] this um
[39:52] past Sunday
[39:56] and studying on all week and it's
[39:58] something worth running for.
[40:02] You know, and that's brother Brandham
[40:04] said in God's provided way. You know,
[40:06] when you when it something worth running
[40:09] for, that's what these these people and
[40:10] these heroes of faith in in chapter 11,
[40:13] you look at what happened to them. You
[40:15] know, you could read the whole chapter
[40:16] and the things that we look at how how
[40:19] they were you look at the fox's book of
[40:21] mortars and all the things that happened
[40:23] to the people of faith back in those
[40:25] days and and it was worth it to them. it
[40:28] it was worth everything they went
[40:30] through to to obtain the promise. And
[40:33] and we look at it and and what they had
[40:35] was was so small to what you and I have
[40:38] have today. And and yet the little bit
[40:41] they had,
[40:42] it was worth it for them to keep running
[40:45] this race. And and Paul tells us in in
[40:47] in we're told in Hebrews to lay aside
[40:49] every weight that so easily beset us.
[40:51] We've got so many things in our life. We
[40:54] got so much things in our in our life
[40:56] that that you know like I said that we
[40:58] could be desperate for.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; You might have a goal in your life in in
[41:02] in your life in your career or whatever
[41:04] it is that's something you've you've set
[41:05] a goal and this is what you want to get
[41:07] by the time you're 35 or or 40 or by the
[41:10] time you graduate college you want to
[41:11] have a a six figure job and and all this
[41:14] and you or you want simple things. You
[41:15] want a family. You want a house. You
[41:17] want different things and and something
[41:19] inside you wants to push you to run for
[41:22] that. There's there's nothing wrong with
[41:24] that when it's in its place. This is
[41:26] something that you feel urged to do.
[41:28] This is what I don't want my family to
[41:30] suffer. I want to get a job that's got
[41:32] great retirement. I want to that gives
[41:34] me a good pension when I'm done and all
[41:36] that. And you and you feel yourself
[41:37] driven for that.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; How much are we driven for things that
[41:43] are eternal?
[41:45] &gt;&gt; IF IF LIFE DRIVES YOU THAT HARD, HOW
[41:48] MUCH MORE SHOULD GOD'S LIFE DRIVE YOU?
[41:53] Is it worth it? It's it's is it's is the
[41:55] FACT THAT WE WE KNOW that in in in the
[41:58] scriptures that that that we're told
[41:59] that the saints that are gone on,
[42:01] they're they're waiting on us. THEY'RE
[42:03] WAITING ON US TO TO REACH this
[42:05] perfection because THEY CAN'T REACH FULL
[42:07] PERFECTION WITHOUT YOU.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham TELLS US IN GOD'S
[42:12] PROVIDED WAY, GRIEVE NOT THE HOLY SPIRIT
[42:14] WHEREBY you are you're sealed until the
[42:17] next revival.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; No.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; No.
[42:20] Until the day of redemption. Is that
[42:22] right? There's no ups and downs, in and
[42:24] outs. You really get into God.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; You have to be into him.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; YOU YOU CAN'T RUN FOR ANYTHING IF YOU
[42:34] AIN'T into it.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; There's some things that people do that
[42:38] you don't
[42:40] A lot of guys like to They're into deer
[42:41] hunting. They're into golf. You might be
[42:45] into
[42:47] I don't I don't know. I like deer
[42:49] hunting. [laughter] off, but you might
[42:52] be INTO LITTLE THINGS. IT'S YOUR OWN
[42:53] THING THAT YOU LIKE TO DO AND YOU MIGHT
[42:55] BE into that AND THAT'S WHAT DRIVES YOU.
[43:00] We need to be into God says, but if God
[43:03] if you're really in him, not just
[43:05] impersonating something, you're really
[43:07] in Christ. That's your one alternative.
[43:10] Your whole heart sold out. Every bridge
[43:13] is burnt behind you. You've got your
[43:15] affection set on things that which are
[43:17] above and you run the race with
[43:20] patience. If we don't know what patience
[43:22] is by now, where have we been?
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; You you we've heard about patience for
[43:28] the last four or five months.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; There's wasp up here.
[43:34] But we look at the heroes of faith.
[43:37] When we read Heb Hebrews 11, this is
[43:40] something that they felt was worth it
[43:42] WHEN THEY HAD TO HIDE IN CAVES. WHEN
[43:44] they they had to they were chased. THEY
[43:46] WERE HUNTED LIKE WILD ANIMALS. Yet they
[43:48] felt like it's worth it.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; It's worth it for FOR MY LIFE TO BE THIS
[43:52] WAY. IT'S WORTH MY LIFE HIDING FOR
[43:55] SOMEBODY TRYING TO KILL ME.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; YEAH. AMEN.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; God looks at them and all they went
[44:05] through. All they were going through,
[44:07] they were poor. They were dirty.
[44:09] Probably no place to bathe. They
[44:11] probably weren't eating good because
[44:12] they was running from hiding place to
[44:14] hiding place. They were they were
[44:16] probably had no appetite because they
[44:18] they had already they were in mourning
[44:20] because they they'd seen their loved
[44:21] ones already
[44:23] torn apart, fed to the lions,
[44:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[44:28] &gt;&gt; And here they are wasting away to
[44:30] nothing. They're smelly. They're
[44:31] stinking. And God looks at them and
[44:32] says, "This entire world
[44:36] is not worthy of these people."
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. What does he say about you?
[44:41] &gt;&gt; When God looks at you in your life and
[44:44] he looks at you and he sees what you're
[44:46] going through.
[44:48] Now, we got to look. They run this race
[44:50] with patience. We have to run it with
[44:51] patience. But we can't so many times cuz
[44:54] we can't get through this one trial cuz
[44:56] your bank account is overdrawn.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; We can't get through this trial.
[45:03] this test that's been put upon us, we
[45:06] all these things THAT THIS THAT GOD HAS
[45:08] ALLOWED UPON ME, WE CAN'T EVEN FIND
[45:10] PATIENCE ANYWHERE in it to run.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; This is more important. YOU YOU LOOK AT
[45:16] YOUR TRIAL AND YOUR TRIBULATION AND YOUR
[45:18] MISTAKES AND YOUR FAILURES LIKE IT'S
[45:20] MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHAT YOU'RE GAINING
[45:22] GOING through it.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; What does Paul and Peter tell us in the
[45:28] Bible? To glory in it,
[45:30] &gt;&gt; to rejoice in it.
[45:33] Amen.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Look at Acts 5
[45:37] in 40. He says, "And to him they agreed.
[45:40] When they had called the apostles and
[45:42] beaten them, they commanded THAT THEY
[45:44] SHOULD NOT SPEAK IN THE name of Jesus
[45:46] and let them go. They beat them
[45:49] and told him when they let him go, YOU
[45:52] NOT TO PREACH JESUS ever again cuz worse
[45:55] will come upon you."
[45:57] Boy, they showed them, didn't they? and
[46:00] they left and they went their way and
[46:01] they never mentioned Jesus ever again.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; It's the law. The law the law provi
[46:08] prevents me from from reading my Bible.
[46:10] The the law prevents me from doing this.
[46:12] The law prevent that wasn't their
[46:14] attitude.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; They departed from the presence of the
[46:18] council rejoicing that they were counted
[46:22] worthy to suffer shame.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; THEY GOT EXCITED BECAUSE THEY WERE
[46:28] PERSECUTED. THEY GOT EXCITED BECAUSE
[46:31] this is what Christ went through. I GET
[46:34] TO SHARE THAT WITH HIM.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; I GET TO SHARE THEIR SHAME.
[46:39] THEY WENT THEIR WAY REJOICING AND THEY
[46:41] PREACHED HIS NAME EVEN MORE.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; And daily in the temple, in every house,
[46:46] they ceased not to teach and to preach
[46:49] Jesus Christ. That's what your life
[46:51] SHOULD BE DOING EVERY DAY, teaching and
[46:54] preaching Jesus Christ. Amen.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; That's when God looks at you and says,
[46:59] "The world is not worthy of you."
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Because you have a life that is teaching
[47:05] Christ.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; In Romans, Paul tells us that that we
[47:12] glory in our tribulations, knowing that
[47:15] suffering produces endurance. When you
[47:17] suffer, that helps you to endure more.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Suffering brings endurance. What does
[47:23] endurance bring? Endurance brings
[47:25] character.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; That's what you're taking with you.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham SAID THIS. THE ONLY
[47:29] THING YOU'LL TAKE IN THIS LIFE IS your
[47:31] character. Endurance. Endurance in what?
[47:34] Endurance in your suffering.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; That's the character God's molding in
[47:39] you.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE CHARACTER that that you
[47:42] SAYS THIS IS WORTH RUNNING FOR.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; This is what I'M TRYING TO OBTAIN. THIS
[47:46] IS WHAT I'M GOING TO GET.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; God gives you endurance. Why do you need
[47:53] endurance?
[47:54] cuz it's going to get worse.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; There's more coming.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; But that endurance brings character.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; Character brings hope.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; What's the hope for? The finish line.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; That's what you're running for.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; That's where you're going.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you if you can't endure,
[48:20] if you can't endure, you won't produce a
[48:22] character that character will tell you.
[48:25] If you have the right kind of character,
[48:26] you look at runners, well, their whole
[48:29] character is, I'll never quit. I'll
[48:31] never stop. I don't care how long it
[48:34] takes.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; All their training, their whole life IS
[48:38] IS IS BUILT AROUND a finish line.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; That's why THEY TRAIN. THAT'S WHY THEY
[48:45] RUN all the time. It's not to see how
[48:48] far, how how long, how this their their
[48:51] goal is the finish line.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; When you go to run a 5K, THERE'S A LOT
[48:56] OF YOU GUYS and you gals in here that
[48:57] run. You're you're not in that race to
[49:00] beat to win the entire race. You know
[49:03] it. I know it. EVERYBODY KNOWS IT. I've
[49:05] seen you run. You've seen me run once.
[49:11] But the WHOLE THING THAT IS BUILT AROUND
[49:13] THAT'S THE FINISH LINE. WHO ARE YOU
[49:15] RUNNING AGAINST? YOU'RE RUNNING AGAINST
[49:17] YOURSELF.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; You're running against the things of
[49:20] humanity. You push YOURSELF TO PLACES
[49:23] YOU'VE NEVER BEEN BEFORE.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; YOU ENDURE TO A SPOT THAT YOU SAID, "THE
[49:30] LAST RACE I RUN, I I REACHED HERE. THIS
[49:32] NEXT ONE, I'M going further."
[49:36] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE FINISH LINE. WHY? YOU HAVE
[49:39] PEOPLE AT THE END OF THAT FINISH LINE
[49:41] WAITING ON YOU,
[49:42] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[49:43] &gt;&gt; THEY AIN'T GIVING YOU HIGH FIVE A MILE
[49:45] BEFORE the race.
[49:48] They ain't saying, "Yeah, YOU DONE IT."
[49:50] A MILE OR TWO BEFORE THE END OF THE
[49:52] RACE.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; They're at the finish line.
[49:56] You have people there this MORNING
[49:58] THAT'S ENCOURAGING YOU. WE ARE COMPASSED
[50:00] ABOUT BY A CLOUD OF WITNESSES. YEAH.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY THAT'S MENTIONED IN HEBREWS 11
[50:06] is cheering you on.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; They're not hoping you make it.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; THEY KNOW THE SAME GOD THAT STAYED WITH
[50:16] THEM WHEN THEY WERE HIDING,
[50:18] WHEN THEY WERE BEING ripped apart, WHEN
[50:21] THEY WERE BEING TORTURED. The same God
[50:24] is the one that's driving you. So they
[50:27] know that YOU'LL REACH THAT PLACE, BUT
[50:29] THEY ALSO KNOW they have to go through
[50:32] things like we did.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Don't lose faith.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; DON'T GET TO THE SPOT IN YOUR LIFE, I
[50:39] CAN'T DO IT NO MORE.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Your heart was never in it.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; Your mind was.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; If you play mind games, you ask some of
[50:50] these people that that run. When your
[50:52] mind starts telling you you can't,
[50:55] &gt;&gt; you're looking for a place to stop and
[50:57] walk.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; You're looking for a place of rest.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; People are resting after 40 years.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; People are resting after 50 years. THEY
[51:08] FOUND A NICE SPOT ON THE SIDE OF THE
[51:10] trail
[51:11] &gt;&gt; to sit down.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Once you stop,
[51:16] once you stop, it's hard to get started
[51:19] back. Ain't it, brother Timmy? ONCE YOU
[51:22] STOP, THEM LEGS QUIT MOVING.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; It's hard to get started back.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Why? Because everything around you
[51:30] begins to look good.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; That gentle breeze that you're feeling
[51:33] now feels good.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; But you're in a race.
[51:39] You're in a race.
[51:41] You have something worth running for.
[51:46] And I believe every once in a while, God
[51:48] gives us glimpse
[51:50] through this message of what we're
[51:52] running for.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; You had a seventh day messenger go
[51:56] beyond the curtain of time and and says,
[51:58] "Whatever you do, whatever you do, you
[52:01] don't want to miss that.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Don't miss that."
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Peter tells us, encourages the
[52:11] believers, DON'T BE SURPRISED AT THE
[52:13] FIERY TRIAL.
[52:16] Don't let it surprise you because it's
[52:18] coming.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; And many of us can attest to that. We've
[52:22] had trials. We we've had things. We've
[52:24] lost loved ones. We've we've we've had
[52:26] failure in our lives. We've we've done
[52:28] things in our lives and and we've seen
[52:30] God bring us through that.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; So don't be surprised BECAUSE WHAT WHAT
[52:35] DID PAUL SAY? It's building character.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; It's it's character molding. SO DON'T BE
[52:40] SURPRISED. YOU CAN'T BE A runner and not
[52:44] have training.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Training hurts worse than the race
[52:48] sometimes.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Getting prepared for a certain run in
[52:53] your life.
[52:55] It was Justin was singing. It's so easy
[52:57] when you're on on the mountain mountain
[52:59] top and it's you're just going. It's
[53:01] easy sailing.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; But then when you get down in the
[53:05] valley,
[53:08] things go wrong. The terrain is is tough
[53:10] down there. There's fallen trees.
[53:12] There's all kinds of things in your
[53:14] life,
[53:16] &gt;&gt; but you can't get to the mountaintop
[53:18] until you first go through that.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; That's the only way up to the top.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; And when you GET TO THE TOP, GUESS WHAT?
[53:26] THERE'S ANOTHER SIDE OF that mountain
[53:27] and it's going to take you right back
[53:29] down. So don't be surprised when you end
[53:31] up in another valley.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. PETER SAYS, "DO NOT BE SURPRISED
[53:36] AT THE FIERY TRIAL WHICH COMES UPON YOU
[53:38] TO TEST you as though something strange
[53:41] was happening to you."
[53:43] &gt;&gt; This is not strange. We We know that
[53:45] God's people go through tests and
[53:47] trials. It's happened in every age.
[53:50] Leoty is no different.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; You're not exempt from test and trials
[53:54] because you're in the age of the
[53:56] rapture. God is going to let you sit on
[53:58] that little soft cushy mattress.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; No.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; God said, "I am God. I change not.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; I change not. If I put them through it,
[54:07] I'm going to put you through it.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; So the heroes of faith, they're urging
[54:18] us to lay aside everything that would
[54:19] hinder us. You're living in the day that
[54:22] they wanted to see.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; This is the day that they wanted to see.
[54:27] That's why they're urging you on. They
[54:29] knew this was the last day. They they
[54:30] also heard Jesus say, "Well, I'm going
[54:33] away."
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; You marvel at the works that they
[54:36] marveled at the works that Jesus did.
[54:38] And Jesus said, "Greater things than
[54:40] this shall you do." They wanted to see
[54:41] those greater things.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Some of them, they probably didn't think
[54:46] it was a greater thing by by being burnt
[54:49] to burn at the state. They probably
[54:51] didn't think it was a greater thing to
[54:54] have to be beheaded.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. Amen.
[54:58] SOMETIMES IT DON'T FEEL LIKE A GREATER
[55:00] THING TO YOU WHEN you're going through
[55:01] your trial.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus, YOU WE WE TAKE GOD BACK TO HIS
[55:06] OWN WORD. SO many times we we we try to
[55:08] take God back to his word. I can't
[55:10] believe I'm going through this. God, you
[55:12] said in your word, if we had fa faith
[55:14] the size of a GRAIN OF A MUSTARD SEED,
[55:16] ANYTHING WE SAY THAT you would remove
[55:17] it, Lord, take this off of me.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. I think we should be
[55:22] praying for God's understanding more
[55:24] than for God to take something off you
[55:26] because there might be a an eternal
[55:28] purpose that God is putting something on
[55:30] you,
[55:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:31] &gt;&gt; But we want to throw the WORD BACK IN
[55:33] GOD'S FACE. GOD, YOU SAID BELIEVERS, LAY
[55:35] HANDS ON THE SICK AND THEY SHALL
[55:37] RECOVER.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; That's that's the way I I I look at the
[55:41] passing of our loved ones. They got the
[55:43] ultimate eternal recovery.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; They shall recover. There's you, you
[55:49] know, you you look look at the the
[55:51] people that that's passed on. They're
[55:53] not suffering no more.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; They have what we're trying to get to.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; They have what we're trying to gain.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; I I I can't I can't put myself in in in
[56:03] your shoes. I can't empathize with you
[56:05] cuz, you know, I still have my parents.
[56:07] I have them all my brothers and my
[56:08] siblings by God's grace.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; But I can tell you what he said.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; That they're in a greater place.
[56:17] and and this this place that there's
[56:20] they're waiting on you.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; I think so often we miss that.
[56:28] Brother Brandham said in Jehovah Gyra,
[56:31] "Our heavenly father, we think, we thank
[56:33] thee for what our eyes have seen, our
[56:35] ears have heard, the revelation of Jesus
[56:38] Christ to his people and have the priv
[56:41] privilege of living in this day that all
[56:44] the patriarchs and prophets, apostles,
[56:46] great men and years gone have longed to
[56:48] see this day.
[56:50] They could only rise on the scene, THESE
[56:52] ANCIENT PROPHETS, and see the very thing
[56:54] that that they saw in them years now
[56:56] being done.
[56:58] What an am and
[57:01] evangelistic services that would be
[57:04] locked in jails. Call them crazy people.
[57:06] We live in the day to see all of this
[57:08] that they saw by faith.
[57:11] God, let us take the opportunity while
[57:13] it's present to us. They are depending
[57:16] on us.
[57:18] They left their word, the word of God
[57:20] that was shown to them. They're
[57:22] depending on us to carry it out.
[57:25] Jesus came to confirm it, to send the
[57:27] Holy Spirit to continue the work and
[57:30] give us power to work by till these
[57:32] things should be finished. And then the
[57:33] great ransom church of the living God
[57:35] shall be caught up to meet him.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; They can't win the race without you.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; They they It's not in cross country. I I
[57:45] did run for one year, believe it or not.
[57:48] I wanted to get out of world history.
[57:53] So, it was available.
[57:58] [snorts]
[57:58] &gt;&gt; But as a team, to get a team win,
[58:01] everybody has to cross.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; This is a team effort.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; They they've ran their leg.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; You're the anchor.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; You You are the anchor. There's no
[58:13] there's no trophies. There's no rewards,
[58:15] no nothing being handed out until you
[58:17] cross.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; So, let's not delay. Let's not look at
[58:22] the scenery around us and not let's not
[58:25] let's not think in our mind, I you know,
[58:27] I'm I'm tired. I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR
[58:30] so long. I'm tired now. I don't I can't
[58:33] don't feel like I'm going anywhere.
[58:35] That's the mind.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; That's the mind. But the soul, the soul
[58:42] is what's running.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; The soul is what's pulling you on. The
[58:46] soul, your you have the same thing in
[58:48] here that they have. And they have to
[58:49] connect. They have to meet up at the
[58:52] finish line.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; We cross the finish line as a team.
[58:56] That's what Paul said. The dead and
[58:58] Christ shall rise first and then we that
[59:01] are alive and remain shall meet them
[59:04] in the air.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; We meet them. We be we come together
[59:08] with them because we finish together.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; I'm sure if we could hear him this
[59:16] morning, they'd be urging us to run with
[59:19] everything we got.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; In the token, there came from the body
[59:25] of our Lord Jesus Christ, water, blood,
[59:28] and life. And the whole church, the
[59:29] bride together has been made up through
[59:31] justification, sanctification, and the
[59:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost, which is the
[59:35] token. As Hebrews 11 says, all those all
[59:38] these who wandered about in sheep skkins
[59:40] and goat skins were destitute and all
[59:42] these things that they done yet was not
[59:45] made perfect without us.
[59:48] And the church in this day, they've
[59:49] received the token of the baptism of the
[59:52] Holy Spirit. That's the blood has been
[59:54] shed. That's the Holy Ghost is upon the
[59:55] church. Without us, they cannot raise.
[59:59] But they're depending on us for God
[1:00:01] promised he would have it. And somebody
[1:00:02] is going to be there. I don't know who
[1:00:04] it's going to be. I hope it's me. I'm
[1:00:06] believing it's me.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Somebody h from this age has to meet
[1:00:10] them.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; It's going to be me.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; I don't know who it's going to be.
[1:00:15] Somebody's going to receive it. The only
[1:00:16] thing that I'm responsible is to preach
[1:00:18] it. It's God's business to look look out
[1:00:22] for that predestinated seed. There's
[1:00:23] going to be there because there's going
[1:00:25] to be each one of them one with the
[1:00:28] other. The water age, the blood age, and
[1:00:29] now the token age of the Holy Ghost.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; They had a revelation. They had a
[1:00:36] revelation back then
[1:00:38] of what was at the finish line. That's
[1:00:40] that's why they ran so hard. That's why
[1:00:43] they saw that this was worth running
[1:00:44] for. This was a race. They they they
[1:00:46] were they raised up their hands and
[1:00:48] said, "I'll go.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; I I know what lays before me. I know
[1:00:53] what they did to Christ. I know what
[1:00:54] they did to Peter. I know what they did
[1:00:56] to Paul AND THE DISCIPLES. I'LL GO
[1:00:57] ANYWAY."
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN. You know, we if I read it one
[1:01:01] time, I'll probably never read it again
[1:01:02] because it's it's it's so it's so
[1:01:06] depressing. But if you read read the
[1:01:07] Fox's book of martyrs,
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; there's a lot of accounts and there's
[1:01:12] other accounts that that that some other
[1:01:14] writers back in the them um 15th, 16th,
[1:01:18] 17th century wrote about the martyrs and
[1:01:20] and there one is about this this man
[1:01:22] named Nick Nicomeus.
[1:01:25] They they had Nicomeus there and they
[1:01:26] they put him on the rack and first they
[1:01:28] told him they said you need to denounce
[1:01:30] Christ
[1:01:32] and sacrifice to to this God or to this
[1:01:36] or whatever.
[1:01:37] And he said, "I'll never do it.
[1:01:41] I'll never do it." He he knew the rack
[1:01:42] was was waiting him. So they put him on
[1:01:44] the rack and they begin, Brother Donnie
[1:01:46] talked about it here a week or two ago.
[1:01:48] They began to stretch him out.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah. They stretched him out and pulled
[1:01:52] it harder and harder and finally he
[1:01:54] recanted.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; He recanted in in in some of the writing
[1:02:00] says that when they let him loose
[1:02:03] that the devil come upon him and he
[1:02:04] began to beat his head up on the ground,
[1:02:07] ended up dying right there. And there's
[1:02:08] a 16-year-old girl. I want youth to
[1:02:10] listen to me a minute. There's a
[1:02:12] 16year-old girl named Denisa.
[1:02:16] When she saw that he recanted,
[1:02:20] it says she yelled out. There was a
[1:02:21] crowd of people there and she yelled
[1:02:23] out, "You miserable wretch.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; You traded.
[1:02:30] You traded a a an eternity."
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; For a moment,
[1:02:37] one single moment
[1:02:40] without pain.
[1:02:45] As soon as they took him off, he died.
[1:02:48] He recanted Christ and he died.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; So there's one of the the soldiers there
[1:02:54] that was around there, they said, "Are
[1:02:55] you a Christian?" She said, THEY SAID
[1:02:56] SHE SCREAMED OUT, "YES, I AM."
[1:03:02] And what they did to her,
[1:03:06] the writings say that they gave her to
[1:03:07] two soldiers and they took her in a
[1:03:09] house and they tried to have their way
[1:03:11] with her all night.
[1:03:14] and she fought him off all night and
[1:03:15] when she couldn't fight no more.
[1:03:19] The figure in white walked into the
[1:03:21] room.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; The two soldiers
[1:03:26] gave their life to Christ.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; They killed all three of them.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; But to her, it was worth it.
[1:03:37] You know, and I don't take lightly that
[1:03:39] you young sisters sometimes get made fun
[1:03:41] of for wearing a skirt, long hair, no
[1:03:44] makeup.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; You didn't go through that.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; They thought that was worth it.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; A long skirt, sisters, should be worth
[1:03:54] it.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Modest apparel,
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; a clean heart, a clean face
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; should be worth it. Amen.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter the shame that's put
[1:04:05] upon you here. It's when eternal glory
[1:04:08] is put upon you over there.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; That's what we're running to.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't quit running because
[1:04:16] somebody made fun of you.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; DON'T DON'T THINK IT'S NOT WORTH IT. AND
[1:04:21] I KNOW YOU COME HOME FROM SCHOOL or you
[1:04:23] come home from your job or whatever and
[1:04:25] you go to your room and you cry and you
[1:04:27] cuz people are making fun of you.
[1:04:33] You think I can't take it no more. I
[1:04:36] can't run like this no more. You keep it
[1:04:39] inside. You don't talk to nobody. You
[1:04:42] don't tell nobody.
[1:04:46] And all the while,
[1:04:48] [snorts] God says you're building
[1:04:51] endurance.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Your endurance is building character.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Your character's giving you hope.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Giving you hope.
[1:05:05] As we said here a couple weeks ago,
[1:05:08] making fun of people, talking about you,
[1:05:10] the things that you go through, it's
[1:05:12] just a a little second compared to what
[1:05:15] you gain. Is this one little second
[1:05:18] that you go through? Is it not worth it?
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Is it not worth running this race? Yes.
[1:05:26] Amen.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; There's others that there's others that
[1:05:30] are coming up behind you are going to go
[1:05:32] through the same thing and God's given
[1:05:34] you a testimony.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; You know, I' I've been to races. I I go
[1:05:38] watch the the people here race and I
[1:05:40] watch them and I think, man, I wish I
[1:05:42] could run like that. I can't. I'm almost
[1:05:45] 60.
[1:05:47] So, I like to admire Timmy and others to
[1:05:49] get out and run, you know, and so, you
[1:05:52] know, and Tim Murray, Lord, he's older
[1:05:54] than me
[1:05:56] and dude can run.
[1:05:59] They let him out of the nursing home to
[1:06:00] go run 5Ks.
[1:06:05] But you look at that and there's people
[1:06:08] there there's young people that are 10,
[1:06:10] 12, 13 years old that are watching your
[1:06:13] LIFE
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; AND THEY'RE SAYING, "I WANT TO RUN LIKE
[1:06:16] THAT.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; I want to be like them."
[1:06:22] [snorts] But you flip that on the other
[1:06:24] spectrum. If you're not living right,
[1:06:26] you're still creating a testimony.
[1:06:30] If you're if you're cheating a little
[1:06:32] bit on your your skirts and you're
[1:06:33] you're putting a little makeup here,
[1:06:35] you're you're reading things you
[1:06:36] probably shouldn't be reading and doing
[1:06:38] little different things.
[1:06:41] There's little ones that's wanting to
[1:06:43] run
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; and you might be their hero.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; They they might want to be like you.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; You don't want to get on that on the
[1:06:53] other side the day of judgment and you
[1:06:55] be accountable for souls going to hell.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; That's true. because they looked at your
[1:07:00] life. They wanted to run like you
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; and that's what they ran to.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; It's a sobering thought. It's something
[1:07:08] that we should think about.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:07:17] [snorts] human nature
[1:07:20] tries to make us slow down. [snorts]
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; it's tough. Come home from work, things
[1:07:26] happening. Maybe you the job you're on
[1:07:28] is getting ready to end. You don't know
[1:07:30] and you just you don't see the end of
[1:07:32] it. Things happen in your life and it's
[1:07:34] so easy to slow down this race.
[1:07:38] It's so easy. You know, I I was studying
[1:07:40] this last night. I had all these notes
[1:07:42] and I went back in there and put this in
[1:07:43] there because I [snorts] got to thinking
[1:07:45] about Peter
[1:07:47] because so often we look at the mistakes
[1:07:49] in our failures in our life. We we look
[1:07:52] at things that we've done and listen
[1:07:56] we've all sinned and fell short of the
[1:07:59] glory of the God of God. Right? We've
[1:08:00] all we've came into the world speaking
[1:08:02] lies. We've born and shaped in iniquity.
[1:08:04] Your human flesh, even if you have the
[1:08:06] Holy Ghost,
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; this flesh will fail you.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Right? You you you're not in a glorified
[1:08:12] body.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; So, let's get that out of the way. There
[1:08:15] ain't no If anybody in here is in a
[1:08:16] glorified body, the rapture is getting
[1:08:19] ready to happen
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; cuz it's probably one of your loved ones
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; cuz it ain't none of us.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; And we make mistakes. We make failures
[1:08:28] and and we stumble. There's there's some
[1:08:30] of the greatest runners in the world end
[1:08:32] up not finishing. They give up for one
[1:08:35] reason or the other. And and so many
[1:08:37] times we we slow down. We begin to look
[1:08:39] at I did this and sometimes some people
[1:08:42] might say the sin that I committed is is
[1:08:45] worse than in God's eyes it's all sin
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; right
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; God don't look at you for doing one
[1:08:51] thing that you you think that is is
[1:08:53] worse than somebody else God just said
[1:08:54] sin is sin
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; I'm going to punish you more because you
[1:08:58] did this and then I'm going to punish
[1:08:59] him because his wasn't so bad
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; God don't look at it that way sin is sin
[1:09:04] and so many times Satan is the one that
[1:09:07] magnifies it in our mind.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; We begin to slow down. We begin to look
[1:09:12] at these faults and these failures in
[1:09:14] our lives and we begin to slow down.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; How how can I be a Christian if I did
[1:09:21] this? How can I have the Holy Ghost if
[1:09:23] if I did that this, you know? And
[1:09:25] imagine when Peter's running to the tomb
[1:09:27] that day. I wonder if Peter began to
[1:09:30] think because the Bible says that John
[1:09:32] outran him.
[1:09:34] Was John faster or does Peter just begin
[1:09:38] to think?
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; I denied him.
[1:09:44] [snorts]
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; I lied to him.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; I cursed.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; I I told him I'd never leave him, never
[1:09:54] forsake him. He's standing there.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; And I told people, "I don't know this
[1:09:59] man."
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; And all this Peter's running. I want to
[1:10:04] see him. I WANT TO SEE HIM. I I WANT TO
[1:10:06] I want to hug him. I want to I can't
[1:10:09] believe I did that.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; What's he going to do to me?
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; What's he going to do to me for all that
[1:10:17] I done? And then the Bible tells us when
[1:10:19] when they think Peter gets to scene,
[1:10:21] Jesus never mentioned it.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus never said, "Peter, why did you
[1:10:27] deny me?"
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Why did you lie TO ME? I WAS THERE for
[1:10:31] you the whole time.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:35] Why did you lie?
[1:10:37] [snorts] Why did you say you didn't know
[1:10:39] me?
[1:10:41] What did Jesus tell him? Peter,
[1:10:44] go feed my sheep.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; I'm putting a ministry on you, Peter.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; That's what I think of you. I want you
[1:10:51] to spread my word.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; That's what I think of you.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; I want you to feed. I want you to
[1:10:59] prepare
[1:11:01] my people for the finish line.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; That's what he thought of Peter. That's
[1:11:08] what he thinks of you.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; When you get to thinking, I've done this
[1:11:11] and you've repented. Lord, you know the
[1:11:14] you're required to repent one time.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; One time.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; People go a lifetime repenting of the
[1:11:22] same thing.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Over and over. And sometimes they can't
[1:11:27] help it because there's there's people
[1:11:29] that keep reminding them.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, you did this. You did that.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Be careful whose sins you're reminding
[1:11:39] people of.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; You might find yours worse.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; We have to run together.
[1:11:48] We're we're in this race together. It's
[1:11:50] this is not a a me and and and and no
[1:11:52] more and all that.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; The prize is perfection. And that's what
[1:11:56] that's what they're counting on us. The
[1:11:59] people that get tired of of of running,
[1:12:01] they they've never caught their second
[1:12:03] wind.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; They never caught a second wind. How
[1:12:06] many knows what a second wind is?
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; I decided to do some research
[1:12:12] on the second wind. And sports
[1:12:13] scientists say that second wind a lot of
[1:12:16] times has to do a lot with what you eat.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; It's what you eat.
[1:12:24] Your body builds up what they call
[1:12:25] lactic acids. And lactic acid will will
[1:12:27] pull you down, drag you down, and and
[1:12:29] make you feel like you can't push
[1:12:31] through this brick wall that you're in
[1:12:33] front of you.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; But if you eat the right things, it
[1:12:36] breaks down that lac that lactic acid
[1:12:39] and it produces energy.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; And then you've get something that comes
[1:12:45] over you.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; You feel like you can run forever.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; You pick the pace up. You have more
[1:12:53] energy. You think more positive.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; There's no stopping you.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; That's what happened in the upper room.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; They they were running.
[1:13:07] They They had been running for a while,
[1:13:09] for 40 days or however long it was,
[1:13:13] but unless they got that second wind
[1:13:15] that came through the upper room, they
[1:13:17] weren't going to finish. That's
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; right. Unless you get the second win,
[1:13:22] the Holy Ghost, you're not going to
[1:13:24] finish.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; The only one that finishes this race is
[1:13:28] those that have got the second wind, the
[1:13:30] Holy Ghost.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; How do you get it? It's what you eat.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; What are you feeding on?
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; WHAT WHAT'S IN YOUR DIET?
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; You have to these these people that run
[1:13:40] the the the Boston Marathons and these
[1:13:42] these big huge marathons, they have a
[1:13:45] strict diet.
[1:13:47] Their diets consist of vitamin B's and
[1:13:49] magnesium and potassium and calcium
[1:13:52] according to what I read. This is not my
[1:13:54] own knowledge. And this is things that
[1:13:56] they put in their diet and and and this
[1:13:58] is strategic to how they run.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; You've been given A DIET ON HOW TO RUN.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; You've been given a a a recipe as it
[1:14:09] were
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; that says eat this.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; This will sustain you. Amen.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; And there's so much that comes with it.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; When you eat this diet and you become
[1:14:21] one with this, you get your second wind.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; I remember [snorts]
[1:14:31] when I was running cross country in
[1:14:34] Kentucky. I was a freshman.
[1:14:38] I I was not fast by any stretch of the
[1:14:40] imagination, even worse than that.
[1:14:42] [snorts]
[1:14:44] But I I wouldn't stop.
[1:14:47] I didn't I I refused to stop. My dad was
[1:14:50] in the Marines and some of our
[1:14:52] punishments sometimes he'd make us run.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; I was like, "Man, dad, whip me and get
[1:14:56] it over with."
[1:14:58] But he would make us run and he would
[1:14:59] run all the time. And [snorts]
[1:15:03] so
[1:15:04] that was one thing in my that I had
[1:15:07] determined I'm I'm not stopping.
[1:15:10] There was never a cross country meet
[1:15:12] that ever went to that I didn't finish
[1:15:15] ever.
[1:15:17] Sometimes I might have been near the
[1:15:18] back of the pack or at the back. I
[1:15:20] didn't care. I wasn't I knew I wasn't
[1:15:22] going to win the race.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; But I was racing against me.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; And this this course is not going to
[1:15:28] beat me. I'm going to finish it.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; And we had a we had a a senior on our
[1:15:33] team named Billy Parker. And Billy
[1:15:36] Parker was top 10 in the state. He had a
[1:15:37] 5-3 mile
[1:15:41] [snorts]
[1:15:43] and we'd be we would be practicing. We
[1:15:46] we would run around the the baseball
[1:15:49] field, football field and everything was
[1:15:50] all fenced in and we would run around
[1:15:54] it. We would we did 3.6 miles a a day in
[1:15:57] in a training day like every other day,
[1:16:00] whatever.
[1:16:02] Billy Parker would lap me before I got
[1:16:04] one lap in.
[1:16:07] Billy Parker didn't leave me.
[1:16:10] Billy Parker would pull his jersey out.
[1:16:13] Say, "Joe, grab my jersey.
[1:16:18] Grab my jersey."
[1:16:21] When I reached out and grabbed Billy
[1:16:22] Parker's jersey,
[1:16:26] first of all, what gave me a little bit
[1:16:28] of energy was the fact that he took
[1:16:30] interest in me.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; You say, "Joe, grab my jersey.
[1:16:37] and you keep my pace.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; For some reason, when I had hold of that
[1:16:43] jersey, I knew Billy Parker was pulling
[1:16:45] me into that pace. I knew I wasn't
[1:16:47] keeping it.
[1:16:49] And he would run
[1:16:53] and I would get faster long as I was
[1:16:55] holding that jersey.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; You know, and when I was studying this,
[1:16:59] all this started coming back
[1:17:03] to me. And I always I've thought of
[1:17:05] Billy Parker for many years just for
[1:17:07] that reason
[1:17:08] that he was willing to help me.
[1:17:12] You know, I got to thinking how many
[1:17:14] times in our life
[1:17:17] we see somebody struggling
[1:17:20] [snorts] trying to to get a leg up.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Trying to Let me Let me tell you
[1:17:25] something. Jesus said, "Narrow is the
[1:17:27] way.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Straight is the gate. Narrow is the way.
[1:17:30] Few there be that find it." It it ain't
[1:17:31] easy.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. This this life is is is this this
[1:17:35] race that you're running is not an easy
[1:17:37] race.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THAT'S WHY SOME PEOPLE WANT TO
[1:17:40] SIT DOWN.
[1:17:42] THAT'S WHY SOME PEOPLE CAN'T get but
[1:17:44] they never get NOBODY TO PULL A JERSEY
[1:17:46] OUT AND hand it to them.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Grab them up.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; You can't tell me with five, six hundred
[1:17:54] people, there's no telling how many
[1:17:56] people are struggling
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; spiritually. How often do we DO WE SAY
[1:18:01] GRAB A HOLD?
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Grab a hold.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; We'll [snorts] finish this together.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; But you're just worried about you and
[1:18:12] your own and nobody else. You want to be
[1:18:15] the most spiritual person in church. You
[1:18:17] want to be the first one here. You want
[1:18:19] to sit on the front row. You want to
[1:18:20] show how much you know. Have you helped
[1:18:22] anybody? Come on.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Have you helped anybody that can't run?
[1:18:27] You haven't seen them in two or three
[1:18:28] weeks in church.
[1:18:31] Have you called him?
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; It's a struggle.
[1:18:38] [snorts]
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Leodysa is not easy.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; It's made for eternal beings.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Leodysia, this was an age for eternal
[1:18:51] beings.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; God made manifest. You you are the you
[1:18:55] are what what [snorts] the the the mages
[1:18:58] wanted to see. They wanted to see God
[1:19:00] fully manifest in a human being and
[1:19:02] bring that human being to perfection.
[1:19:03] Brother Brandham said you are his
[1:19:05] perfection. That's what they wanted to
[1:19:07] see. They didn't get to see it.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; They didn't they didn't get they didn't
[1:19:11] live to see it.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; But here you are EVERY MORNING YOU WAKE
[1:19:15] UP AND YOU GO LOOK in the mirror.
[1:19:18] you and you look in the mirror and and
[1:19:20] and and if you look at yourself
[1:19:21] spiritually,
[1:19:24] you this nice lean steady runner.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; That's the way God looks at you.
[1:19:34] Let's start helping others on our team.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Because without them,
[1:19:39] you will not be perfected.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; You can run off and leave them all you
[1:19:43] want.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; You can leave them all you want.
[1:19:48] If you do, I question, are you going to
[1:19:51] are you going to cross the finish line?
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; If you're willing to leave others
[1:19:55] behind,
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; are you going to cross?
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; That that's why I I struggle with
[1:20:02] people's favorite preacher.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; It's my favorite preacher. I can't get
[1:20:06] nothing from him. I because it's all
[1:20:08] depends on what you're expecting,
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; You've already formed an expectation
[1:20:12] before you whenever you found out who
[1:20:13] was preaching. You've already formed an
[1:20:15] expectation. Come on.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Sorry, but that's the truth.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; That's the truth. Instead of saying, "I
[1:20:20] I don't care if if there's a fence post
[1:20:21] up here preaching. If I have a need,
[1:20:23] God, let that fence post
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; speak to my need." [applause]
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; But I always thought people said, "This
[1:20:32] preacher, this my favorite preacher,
[1:20:33] this this my what if your preacher don't
[1:20:36] make it?
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; What if he don't make it in?"
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:20:42] So many So many people have fallen
[1:20:44] because their favorite preacher has
[1:20:45] fallen. That's right.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; So many people have bailed out of the
[1:20:48] race because their preacher has bailed
[1:20:50] out of the race.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; I'm not following brother Donnie.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; I'm following the Christ he's presenting
[1:20:58] to me.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; He's following the same Christ.
[1:21:02] [applause]
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; It's a message. It's it's what what
[1:21:07] every pastor in this message should be
[1:21:09] bringing forth to the people is Christ.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; That's what brother brother Donnie has
[1:21:13] has told the ministers so many times in
[1:21:15] preach Christ.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Preach Christ. Don't preach brother
[1:21:18] Donnie. Don't preach brother Brandon.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Don't preach brother Daryl, brother
[1:21:21] David Soler. YOU DON'T PREACH THAT. YOU
[1:21:22] PREACH CHRIST.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to skip some
[1:21:32] here. Brother Brandham said, "Show us
[1:21:35] the father." [snorts]
[1:21:37] Don't you know, brethren, we ought to be
[1:21:38] leaning against one another.
[1:21:41] Leaning on one another to make shade for
[1:21:44] one another, trying to help one another.
[1:21:47] Not trying to condemn each other, but
[1:21:49] trying to make a little shade, a little
[1:21:51] gospel shade to stand in. For it's a
[1:21:54] weary time that we're living.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; So, we all know what the word Christian.
[1:22:00] I'm not going, please don't nobody raise
[1:22:02] your hand. If I asked
[1:22:06] who's a Christian,
[1:22:08] most of all y'all would raise your hand.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; No doubt.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; And then I would say,
[1:22:15] "How many in here is Christlike?"
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Fewer would probably raise your hand
[1:22:23] because you automatically soon as I
[1:22:25] would say, "Who in here is Christlike?"
[1:22:28] Satan would flood your mind.
[1:22:30] Yeah,
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; I've done this, so that can't be
[1:22:32] Christlike. I've done that. So, but you
[1:22:34] just said you were a Christian.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; To be a Christian is to be Christlike.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; And and that's that's not to decize
[1:22:42] anybody. That's just putting us all in
[1:22:44] one whole lump here. It's not about what
[1:22:47] we think.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; It's not about what we do. It's about
[1:22:51] what God sees in us. Amen.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; If you're living all you know how
[1:22:57] despite your faults and failures, that's
[1:22:59] what the blood was for.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; That's what the blood when God looks at
[1:23:02] you, he sees Christlike.
[1:23:08] [clears throat]
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason why I say that is
[1:23:12] is helping each other.
[1:23:15] I'm going to wind down here.
[1:23:18] But Paul tells us when you when you read
[1:23:21] Tim second Timothy and
[1:23:24] if I'm jumping fellers, I apologize.
[1:23:26] You read second Timothy 4 and this the
[1:23:28] scriptures 7 and 8 where Paul says, "I
[1:23:30] have fought a good fight. I have
[1:23:31] finished my course. I have kept the
[1:23:33] faith. His fourth laid up for me a crown
[1:23:36] of righteousness which is [snorts]
[1:23:39] uh which the Lord, the righteous judge
[1:23:41] shall give me at that day." He hasn't
[1:23:43] got it yet. He's waiting on you
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; to give me at that day. Not to me only,
[1:23:49] but unto them that love his appearing.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Understand what Paul says in verse 7. He
[1:23:54] says, "I have finished
[1:23:56] my course."
[1:23:58] Paul did not say, "I won the race."
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "I won it.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; I finished it."
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; He wins when we win. Amen.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; When we cross,
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Paul wins the race.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; You're racing against your flesh.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says [clears throat]
[1:24:30] in the influence of another, and I I've
[1:24:32] had this quote many, many years ago over
[1:24:33] at the old church. I think brother
[1:24:35] Donnie read it here last year or
[1:24:37] something. When you're playing a ball
[1:24:38] game, as it's football season, the the
[1:24:41] thing we want to do is not everybody try
[1:24:43] to take the ball away from the man
[1:24:45] that's got it.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; He is trying to guard that man, protect
[1:24:48] him, let him get through. We're trying
[1:24:50] to make a goal. See, could you imagine a
[1:24:53] team so untrained as to find one man,
[1:24:55] their own man with the ball running to
[1:24:57] the field goal, and instead of trying to
[1:24:59] knock the en enemy away from him, the
[1:25:01] opposing team, to let your own man
[1:25:03] that's got the ball take off with it?
[1:25:06] Every man is trying to take the ball out
[1:25:07] of his hand, you're bound to lose.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Today, we have the same thing. When we
[1:25:12] see God come on the scene trying to
[1:25:14] bless a certain thing, let's keep all
[1:25:15] the enemies away from it. Let's use our
[1:25:18] influence as tackles, not runners.
[1:25:20] Tackles that protects the runners. Let
[1:25:22] him pack the ball, though,
[1:25:24] because [clears throat] there's no
[1:25:25] opposition. All he has to do is keep
[1:25:26] running. We should be tackles.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad brother Brandham kind of
[1:25:30] understood football a little bit,
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; but that's our job. Everybody wants to
[1:25:36] run the ball. Everybody wants to be the
[1:25:38] one that gets the glory.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; We We've all got our place in this race.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; We've all got a position to fulfill.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; When you have a relay race, you got one
[1:25:49] that starts two in the middle. You got
[1:25:50] to anchor. Usually your anchor is the
[1:25:52] fastest guy.
[1:25:55] Everybody wants to be the anchor.
[1:25:58] Nobody wants wants to be the first guy
[1:26:00] because if if he gets left behind.
[1:26:03] Everybody behind him has got to play
[1:26:05] catchup.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Everybody wants to be the last guy.
[1:26:10] Everybody wants to be the running back.
[1:26:12] Everybody wants to be the quarterback.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; God might just want you to be a fan in
[1:26:16] the stands.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; You can't you can't have a football game
[1:26:20] without the fans.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; There's got to be support. There's got
[1:26:24] to be people cheering on. Come on, Gord.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; There. There's got to be people there
[1:26:27] that's flying your colors.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:26:30] that's right.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Flying your banner.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; And it's you. It's me. It It's Everybody
[1:26:37] wants to be the pastor. Everybody wants
[1:26:38] to be a deacon or A TRUSTEE AND ALL
[1:26:40] THAT. It It takes every position.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; THIS CHURCH IS NOT COMPLETE without you.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Every position in it.
[1:26:49] If you don't do anything but come in
[1:26:51] here half hour before service and you
[1:26:53] pray and read your Bible, you're an
[1:26:56] intricate part of what this happen what
[1:26:58] happens in the service
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; because you came in and you approached
[1:27:02] GOD AND TOLD GOD WHAT YOUR NEED WAS. You
[1:27:04] said you told God that there's other
[1:27:06] needs here.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; In fact, you might be the only one that
[1:27:10] done it.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; We all have a part to play. We all have
[1:27:15] a position
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; to fulfill.
[1:27:19] So we look at the prodal,
[1:27:23] the prodical son in Luke 15:18.
[1:27:26] The prodal says, "I will arise and go to
[1:27:28] my father and I and will say unto the
[1:27:29] father, I have sinned against heaven and
[1:27:32] before thee and am no more worthy to be
[1:27:34] called thy son. Make me as one of thy
[1:27:36] hired servants." And he arose and came
[1:27:38] to his father. But when he was yet a far
[1:27:40] way off, his father saw him, had
[1:27:43] compassion, and ran
[1:27:46] and fell on his neck and kissed him.
[1:27:48] That word ran is of persons in haste of
[1:27:52] those who run in a raceourse.
[1:27:54] Metaphorically a a doctrine rap rap rap
[1:27:56] rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap
[1:27:56] rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap
[1:27:56] rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap
[1:27:56] rap rap rap rap rap rap rap RAPIDLY
[1:27:57] PROPAGATED BY A METAPHOR taken from
[1:27:59] runners in a race to exert oneself to
[1:28:02] spend one's strength in performing to
[1:28:05] attain something
[1:28:07] to denotes to incur extreme peril
[1:28:12] and that's what the father felt not the
[1:28:15] son.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; this is what was going through the
[1:28:18] father when his son saw his son. Now I
[1:28:21] want you to put yourself in here. He saw
[1:28:24] his son returning home. He could have
[1:28:27] said, "Slam the gates."
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Don't let him in here.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; I've gave him everything and he wasted
[1:28:33] it.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; We don't want him back.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; He's in fact he don't even have my name
[1:28:39] anymore.
[1:28:42] But he didn't do that. THE BIBLE SAYS HE
[1:28:44] RAN. He exerted himself
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; to incur extreme peril to strive to
[1:28:50] obtain.
[1:28:51] Amen.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Do you get what I'm saying here? THAT'S
[1:28:54] WHAT GOD DID FOR YOU.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; He ran to you.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; You didn't run to him,
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; You didn't have the right kind of energy
[1:29:01] to run to him.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; You didn't have a second wind. You would
[1:29:05] have never made it.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; But God looked at you and your state.
[1:29:12] When you come back, what what do we look
[1:29:14] at this? He had nothing. When he come
[1:29:16] back, he'd wasted everything. He smelt
[1:29:18] like pigs. He was dirty. All he had was
[1:29:22] the clothes that was on his back.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he wasted everything.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; That's when God took you back when you
[1:29:31] had nothing left.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; You had nothing left. You had nowhere to
[1:29:36] go, nowhere to turn.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; And God takes out at a dead sprint to
[1:29:42] you
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; when he's seen you a way a ways off.
[1:29:46] The Bible never says that the the prodal
[1:29:49] saw his father a way off.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; The father saw him
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; and he ran. He exerted himself.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; In other words, I'll reach you or die.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; That's how God got to got to you.
[1:30:09] [clears throat]
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; What are we running to?
[1:30:13] We're running to an eternal life. an
[1:30:15] eternal city. And you were the very
[1:30:18] reason it was made.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; It was made for you.
[1:30:23] You know what? I was thinking of this
[1:30:25] and we we we've mentioned it a time or
[1:30:26] two.
[1:30:29] Let's stand together.
[1:30:32] You know, we we talk about how
[1:30:37] how the angels react when we get over
[1:30:39] there.
[1:30:41] You know it how brother Brandham talked
[1:30:44] about how they will circled circle the
[1:30:46] earth
[1:30:48] as the bride sings her song of
[1:30:51] redemption
[1:30:54] because they they don't understand that
[1:30:55] song. We sing Amazing Grace.
[1:31:00] How sweet this sound. Angels can't sing
[1:31:03] that. But I wonder how they react
[1:31:07] when you, the bride, walks into that
[1:31:10] front gate.
[1:31:13] Angels are getting ready to see you like
[1:31:16] they've never seen you before.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; When you cross the finish line,
[1:31:22] they've never seen you
[1:31:25] in the perfect image of God in a
[1:31:28] glorified body.
[1:31:31] You've run this race. But the problem
[1:31:33] is, you know, these angels have seen you
[1:31:35] at your worst. And many times I wonder
[1:31:36] if if they've questioned God, God, why
[1:31:39] are you put up with them? Why do you why
[1:31:41] do you do that?
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Look what they're doing. You You've gave
[1:31:44] them chance after chance after chance
[1:31:46] and hear that they still are. They come
[1:31:48] in and they they hear you preach this
[1:31:50] and how they're doing this and they do
[1:31:52] it anyway and they they they come back
[1:31:54] and they they skip for two or three
[1:31:55] weeks and then they COME BACK. GOD, WHY
[1:31:57] do you do? [snorts]
[1:31:59] But I came to rest assured when you
[1:32:00] walking through that gate them angels
[1:32:02] tunes going to change. They're going to
[1:32:05] get excited BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO
[1:32:06] SCREAM OUT, "SHE'S HERE. SHE'S HERE.
[1:32:08] SHE'S FINALLY MADE IT."
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THE
[1:32:11] SAME ONE THAT THEY ENCOURAGE GOD TO
[1:32:13] CHASTISE.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; THE SAME ONE THAT GOD WELL, WHY ARE YOU
[1:32:16] DOING THIS? WHY ARE YOU LETTING THEM BY
[1:32:18] with this?
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Cuz they didn't have the same kind of
[1:32:21] love for you that God's got.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; She's crossed the finish line. She's
[1:32:28] entered into that city
[1:32:31] and now when she gets they get there,
[1:32:33] they're going to be in awe of you.
[1:32:35] Angels, eternal beings are going to be
[1:32:37] in awe of you.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Our our human minds can't comprehend.
[1:32:44] That's why brother Brandon encourages to
[1:32:46] whatever you do, don't miss it. I can't
[1:32:48] he can't said I can't even describe it.
[1:32:50] Human words are not ascri be able to
[1:32:52] describe any of it.
[1:32:56] But when they look at you,
[1:32:59] they get to see the one that God longed
[1:33:00] for for so many years, for thousands and
[1:33:04] thousands and thousands of years, eons
[1:33:07] of time. This
[1:33:10] was God's divine purpose when he opened
[1:33:12] his mouth and said, "Let there be."
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; This is what it was. Amen.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; You in a glorified body
[1:33:23] walking through the pearly gates,
[1:33:27] the finish line.
[1:33:31] You know, we we we got loved ones that's
[1:33:34] over there. Many of you lost loved ones
[1:33:37] and that's I'm sure encouraging you to
[1:33:40] keep going.
[1:33:43] You know, but in this we we look at life
[1:33:46] as it was and we get sad, we grieve and
[1:33:48] you know, like I I did uh brother Bob
[1:33:51] Leven's funeral, you know, and I told
[1:33:53] the family, you know, people say, you
[1:33:55] know, don't grieve. You know, it I say
[1:33:58] grieve. You have to grieve. Grief is is
[1:34:02] is is words of love that you didn't get
[1:34:05] to speak to him anymore. And I know God
[1:34:08] puts grief in your heart, but he makes
[1:34:11] that hole just big enough to where peace
[1:34:13] and comfort lays right beside grief.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; But they're not here no more.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; They're they're they're waiting for us
[1:34:22] to finish so they could finish. But if
[1:34:25] if if I I could speak to you this
[1:34:27] morning, if if if we could hear brother
[1:34:28] Jimmy Babs, Sister Erica, Brother Daniel
[1:34:30] Nutley, Sister Sharon Ward, different
[1:34:32] ones, Brother Steve Newsome, those that
[1:34:33] have went on, they're screaming out.
[1:34:36] Don't stop.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Don't you quit running.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; You where I'M AT RIGHT NOW, YOU DON'T
[1:34:42] WANT TO MISS THIS. AND THAT WHERE
[1:34:43] THEY'RE AT RIGHT NOW IS NOT GOD'S FULL
[1:34:45] GLORY.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Where they're at is peace. It's comfort.
[1:34:52] It's love. It's endless love.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; But God says, "Oh, I've got more for you
[1:34:56] than that.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; You've got your second wind right here.
[1:35:00] You're going to cross the finish line
[1:35:02] one more dimension." Brother Harry,
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; we're almost there.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; If I could encourage you this morning,
[1:35:10] if you don't get nothing out of anything
[1:35:12] that I preach this morning,
[1:35:15] don't quit running.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Don't sit down. Amen.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; I know you get discouraged.
[1:35:23] That's the spirit of Leoa.
[1:35:26] Discouragement.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; You're lukewarm and I would spew you OUT
[1:35:29] OF MY MOUTH BECAUSE you you were either
[1:35:31] hot where you were either hot or cold.
[1:35:33] THAT'S WHAT GOD SAID ABOUT THIS AGE.
[1:35:35] WHETHER YOU WERE HOT OR COLD, but now
[1:35:37] we're in the middle. WE GO TO CHURCH
[1:35:39] JUST WHEN IT'S CONVENIENT.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; We read our BIBLE AND WE PRAY WHEN HARD
[1:35:44] TIMES COME. WHEN EVERYTHING'S GOOD,
[1:35:46] we're just skating along like, "Oh,
[1:35:47] well.
[1:35:52] Let's run this race
[1:35:54] like they did in the first church age.
[1:35:56] Desperation.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Desperation. You'll never see your loved
[1:36:01] ones again if you don't get desperate.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; That's the spirit of this bride is
[1:36:06] desperation to get out of here.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads.
[1:36:19] Heavenly Father,
[1:36:23] Lord, I I know we're living in a time,
[1:36:25] Father, that
[1:36:27] it's hard sometimes.
[1:36:30] We know there's a squeeze coming on this
[1:36:32] bride, Lord. And maybe it's here. Maybe
[1:36:34] it's the first part of it. I don't I
[1:36:36] don't know. You know that more than any
[1:36:38] of us, Lord. And you you will bring it
[1:36:40] to us through your word as you see fit.
[1:36:43] But when it comes, you'll give us
[1:36:44] strength. Lord,
[1:36:46] every leg of this journey, Father, you
[1:36:48] have something for us
[1:36:50] in every part of it.
[1:36:53] Whenever we get tired, we feel like we
[1:36:55] want to quit. We feel like we get bogged
[1:36:57] down and we can't run. But Lord, there's
[1:36:59] something worth running for. If we could
[1:37:02] keep that in our hearts, if we could
[1:37:04] keep that in our minds, Lord Jesus, that
[1:37:06] that there is something at the end of
[1:37:07] this race that we don't want to miss
[1:37:10] instead of focusing on the things around
[1:37:12] us that's trying to drag us down. Lord,
[1:37:15] I pray that you would touch every heart
[1:37:17] here, every need here, Lord. Lord, I
[1:37:20] know we get slow, but Lord, I pray that
[1:37:23] you would give them encouragement. I
[1:37:25] pray that you would give them healing,
[1:37:26] deliverance, whatever it is they need
[1:37:28] for this journey, Lord.
[1:37:30] Lord, may they run this race, Lord, as
[1:37:32] the the song says, with reckless
[1:37:34] abandon, Lord, to never Lord, never give
[1:37:38] up, never quit. Touch each heart here,
[1:37:41] Lord. Touch each life, Lord. May one
[1:37:43] thing be said that would help somebody,
[1:37:45] Lord. I know it went all over the place,
[1:37:47] Lord Jesus, but I pray you would put
[1:37:48] them pieces together for someone. We
[1:37:51] thank you for it in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Brother Harry, if you
[1:37:57] can sing something for us, you know, as
[1:37:59] as I was
[1:38:03] studying this, I was in the library.
[1:38:05] Came over to church last night. I was in
[1:38:07] the library and I got to thinking about
[1:38:09] I don't mean to hold you standing. I got
[1:38:12] to thinking about when coach college
[1:38:14] coaches start looking for for athletes.
[1:38:17] They they they look for athletes that
[1:38:19] can uh help their universities out. They
[1:38:22] somebody they would want to represent
[1:38:24] their team. And one of the first
[1:38:26] questions they ask a high school coach
[1:38:28] when they come to to talk to the about a
[1:38:31] certain athlete is are they coachable?
[1:38:34] Are they coachable? Because you you
[1:38:37] notice sometimes the best the best
[1:38:39] athletes sometimes ain't the ones
[1:38:41] college takes.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Because the high school coach says he
[1:38:45] thinks he knows everything.

[1:39:06] whoever it is, Brother Daryl, come up
[1:39:07] here. And they start preaching the word
[1:39:09] and they think, I need I need to do
[1:39:11] that.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; I need to change what I'm doing and do
[1:39:14] that. Th this this this is the training
[1:39:17] program.

[1:39:19] program.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. and you come in here on Sunday in
[1:39:23] Wizzy and you get to pick up training on

[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; If you ain't coachable, you'll never do
[1:39:31] it.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; God's looking for some that'll forsake
[1:39:35] everything they've got. What we when I
[1:39:37] said when we first come out, you got
[1:39:38] things in your life that you're
[1:39:39] desperate that you chase after. Are you
[1:39:41] willing to forsake that? Are you willing
