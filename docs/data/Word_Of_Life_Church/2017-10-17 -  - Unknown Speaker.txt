[Music] [Applause] and what we've been hearing of late and I'm gonna have to say for myself being where I've been for the past eight or nine years y'all y'all don't understand where I've been I'm gonna be honest with you but when I hear this word going forth the way it's been lately I'm about to get bust outta here I'm about to get out of here I'm becoming more violent if you thought I was bad then look out I'm ready to get out of here Church it's time to stop playing and this song Edwin and Walter Hawkins wrote this song many many years ago and I'm amazed at the inspiration that comes on people's lives to write songs and and the thing that gets me is is that it'll stir you you connect with it but it's good to know that you have the revit early revelation when that when that inspiration strikes you on a song that a denominational person has written that you can catch the real inspiration and the real meaning of what God was warning he's bringing forth that light to the word to the world and they're catching it they they're they but they don't quite understand it but when we get ahold of it we can truly truly know what God was wanting to convey and in return we can get back to him what he was originally wanting anyway so when you sing this song tonight don't be so much singing it to be singing it because brother Louie wants me to sing it sing it because you mean it because I know you know it but do you know it because you got to know it before you know it for when the knowing does come it can connect with that original knowing is that Alright if you wanna know well I'm going where I'm going you know one day soon if you wanna know whether I'm going I'm going it won't be much longer whoa I'm going up to yonder y'all believe it I'm going up the yonder I'm going up yonder gonna be with my lord oh I'm going up the yonder I'm going up yonder I'm going up yonder to be with my lord listen to this devil now I can take the pain the heartache that light brings I have comfort in knowing I'm so gonna put on my wings and fly it's God he's going to give us grace to stay this all-christian race until I see my face [Music] I'm going in the rapture I'm going in the rapture I'm going in the Rancher to be with my best friend in the rapture [Music] do you know that you're going in the rapture I'm going to the rancher GP with my Lola Cigna verse one more time I can take the pain singing because you know it Harding the library I had this comfort and assurance in knowing also because it's gonna give me grace therefore I'm gonna run [Music] my domain with my own eye in the rapture I'm going [Music] [Music] we're going in the right row we're going we're going thank you lord thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah thank you Lord praise be to God y'all better calm down now send me all acting kind of violent scare some of these other folks now be careful praise the Lord well that good Wednesday night oh my the Word of God is always good I told Carol I said you know you look at that parallel of that how that God wants us so passion and so on fire for him you look at many of the Reformation 's what happened when Luther begin to preach to them the truth of justification he was setting there and he said he locked up in the castle because they were seeking for his life to kill him he wrote many many many books many tracks and what he was setting there reading the book of Romans the revelation hit him the just shall live by faith he grabbed his head looking at it looking at it trying to understand the Greek the Latin looking back and forth back and forth and it hit him Christ alone Christ alone when the common people began to hear it I mean they broke out and revival started acting violent but then look what Satan done then many of them actually turned violent they started destroying churches right so what did Satan knew Satan flipped that revival right around and done exactly what he wanted to do was identify that move with a bunch of fanaticism when John Knox many of you know the founder of the Presbyterian Church when he began to see predestination and election many many many hundreds of years ago and whenever what did it happen exactly the same thing many then people started getting violent for the kingdom of God not fighting now and all that sort of thing but it wasn't no time within couple of years that the followers of that Reformation began to also turn violent then they burn churches they've done this and that in the other what Satan wants to do he wants to taint that image of that so when people go to get an emotional clapping and shout and praise God Satan wants to get your mind over to the other side oh boy here we go you're gonna let that old scarecrow scare you I thought you all was Eagles here [Applause] scarecrow shouldn't scare you a man praise the Lord well it's good to be back in the house of the Lord let's turn to the Song of Solomon tonight chapter 5 verse 1 I am coming to my garden my sister my spouse I've gathered my myrrh with my spice I've eaten my honeycomb with my honey I've drunk my wine with my milk ain't all friends drink yay drink abundantly Oh beloved verse 2 I sleep but my heart waketh it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh saying open to me my sister my love my dove my undefiled from my head is filled with Dew how can this be we go from the entrance into the garden to this this is one of most speak to yawn tonight what happened open to me my sister my love my dove my undefiled for my head is filled with Dew and my locks with the drops of the night her response I have put off my coat how shall I put it on I have washed my feet how shall i defile them oh ma let's pray together Lord Jesus thank you for your great presence that we sent sure tonight Lord we asked your God that you would take your word and speak to his father we know in the parallel the age that we live in in the presence of Christ Himself the fullness of the attribute that is returned to the earth for that we are so grateful yet we also know in this age of coldness lukewarmness of Laodicea we must fight it set ourselves against it that we may be engulfed in your presence Lord I pray that you'd take these examples in your word tonight and speak to us blessed father Forte's in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask these favors amen god bless you you may be seated I've said many times in my office or in other places that I would meet with married couples and watch them and watch their body language toward each other and maybe it was a couple that I had married five years ten years 20 years prior to that and remembering and reminiscing how they would look at one another and how they would hold one another's hands and they would look at each other's eyes and the emotion that they both expelled to the other and me watching them and now as I would set and watch them and I would see the same man the same woman a few years older maybe gray hairs you know coming in around the forehead a few children their job changed a few times since then but what is the most overwhelming part to me it's not so much their hair changing him and her boasts maybe getting a few wrinkles in their face and aides kind of creeping up on them maybe they were in their teens or early 20s when I married them and now maybe the 30 35 40 whatever more but what always strikes me is how I watch them as they look at each other now and the way that they are expressing themselves is their body language and they're having stress in their marriage they're having strains or having difficulties maybe it's financially maybe it's because of the job could be doctrinal things it can be various things it always is so heartbreaking to me because as I sit there thinking of what used to be there between them and now what has come between them and I think in my mind what the Word of God declares and what God wants marriage to be and then I'll see what somehow another their marriage has become to where that is fussing and fighting and arguing and debating and they are sitting there looking at one another no longer with love in their eyes but contempt and some I could venture to say I've seen them look at their husband or their wife was so much anger and so much hatred in their eyes and they would look at one another and to be honest with you as I would sit there and look at that I would fear somewhat not so much for myself because so far they're not mad at me they probably will be before I'm done with them but anyway they're sitting there looking at each other with this in their hearts and in their in their very being and their spirit reflecting through their eyes and their body language and I watch them as they'll fling their arms or wrinkle their face or you know this come over their expression and they don't know what I'm done now I've given away a trade secret haven't but sitting there watching them many times I don't have to say are they anything at all because I can see that by watching both of them not many times I've count so marriage people and their own shirts in different parts of the world and I could see right off that it was pretty much a one-sided situation either the husband was to blame or the wife was to blame but more times than not I've seen that there was Fault on both sides now that's why I always get in trouble because the husband always wants me to take sides totally with him and blame the wife and most of the women always want me to take sides with them and totally blame the husband but you see I am a god called man so therefore I know no matter how thin you slice a piece of bread it has two sides and that's why I generally make both sides mad at me and I'm the one that's supposed to be the one to help them but I can't help them unless they both realize I love them both and I'm standing between them to try to help them both see they both got faults well I see this is going to be an aim endless service but that's alright I'm going to preach it anyhow that's right now what I've read to you tonight let me just set it forth to you right right up front this is the setting of this is definitely a one-sided story because the one that we are reflecting as far as the the bridegroom of course is the Lord Jesus and in him there is no fault now no matter how good as men aren't how fill with the Holy Ghost we are there's not a man here tonight or one under the sound of my voice or one that will ever hear this sermon if I live and or die read and I'm begging and this sermon would be played for 250 years or 2,000 years I traum there there'll never be a man that will ever listen to it that will honestly ever be able to stand up and say I am without fault and if you dare do that in this service I'll grab a hold to you and throw you on the ground and cast that devil out of you I do not have to do like the preacher did I might after beat on you a little bit at the same time because whether you're a man or a woman whether you're 20 or 95 every one of us have faults and God can't help any of us til we recognize we have faults and have problems you see as long as you're blaming her for everything or blaming the church for ever saying or blaming the pastor forever saying God can never even deal with you because you're not willing to see where the main problem lays and that's within yourself now but in this situation Christ is totally faultless can y'all say amen to that Christ is totally faultless nothing about this setting is his fault at all he has and always will and always does everything perfect I cannot say that I've not always been the perfect husband I did selfish sometimes I want things my way now I can take this kind of preaching tonight because I'm a Christian I'm filled with the Holy Ghost so I'm not going to do like some of you baby 5 men here tonight that when I get on your Hajj you're going to get quiet on me and then when I get on your wife you're going to scream don't you understand what you're doing you're making an idiot out of yourself in front of the rest of us because you Amen what part you want to and then you dry up on the rest of us a Christian can Amen the word even if that tells the hide off of you a hypocrite setzer and amens what they won't amen praise the Lord but the Lord Jesus is never at fault ah me and Carol have been made as many of you know for a long long time and we've had a wonderful marriage I thank God for a marriage but yet we've not had a marriage to where that she and I did not agree or disagree about things we agree most of the time much more than we disagree and we've learned how to be able to settle our differences and that is if differences come between us that we pray and we come together and we talk and you know if we're both a little bit ill and we're just a little bit strong how from pressure and then I'm a preacher I don't know I'd have any pressure in the age that we're live but every now and then I'll do so it comes from somewhere maybe something y'all text it to me or email or something but anyway I fall under a little bit of pressure so if we get the world that we cannot talk we have learned that we go she goes to one room and I go to the other and we pray and then we come back and try it again and if it don't work then we go back to the other room and we pray and then we and eventually we will sort it out but it takes both of us to be able to say she has to say Donnie I was wrong because I cannot be able to confess her wrong and fix the situation now if I have done something wrong I need to own up to it and make it right if she's done something wrong she needs to own up to it and make it right though Lord Jesus has never had to ask me to forgive him for anything because he's never done anything wrong to me praise the Lord I realize that there are people on the earth today the second guess God and they fill out they know more about how to run a church run a home run a house and God does they know more about salvation they know more about the church I've made a few of those people I'm scared of them close to me they're insane anybody that would think they know more about how to run a church and a human life and God does you better get away from them they're out of their mind that's right because he's the only one that really knows how to do anything right as a matter of fact that's the only thing he's ever done well way back since eternity but in this situation it is the groom that is totally innocent he's totally without fault the groom has not been innocent or let me say it this way the groom has I've been in this scenario Tory's been selfish and he's needed to come back and apologize and ascending on the outside of the door are trying to knock and get back in and please sweetheart I'm sorry you don't find in this setting here where Jesus it's actually apologizing because he hasn't done anything wrong he's not standing here and saying please forgive me please forgive me I should have never raised my voice I should have been more considerate I should have thought about your point of view and I should have listened here when we discussed this before uh well you know I forgive me for doing that he does not do that at all because it's what in the world as a matter with you all say out say Amen and let me know you're alive that you're not a bunch of mummies sitting there like this I believe some of y'all got the mummy you know the mummy button and you just said it and you just rocking back and thought not able to work with me mummy wake up mommy now you know the bride we know is faulty and the bride is flawed of the bride certainly has her faults and every real true woman that is a Christian fill of the Holy Ghost I don't think there's a true woman here tonight that would not admit that she's faulty as well is that right sisters and your sisters raise your hand dear God we've got I didn't realize we had that many angels sure did not it look like people that come to this oh I'm I am so sorry I didn't know angels wore glasses I didn't know angels had problems I mean angel is great gray hair oh my goodness I'm gonna have to rethink this shirt tonight then huh I might need to go back in the studying and redo these notes and do we have any men here tonight would admit that they are faulty and flawed and mistakes if you put that brothers so I can see which one's an angel there's an angel there's one now I find that amazing that there's not near as many men angel says there are women angels in this place wow that is really something but you know since we know how we are human beings and we see that we are faulty and flawed this is the way by which God can be able to get to us because whenever we see the word and we see that we are wrong then we are willing to admit we are wrong as a matter of fact a person with the Holy Ghost will actually step over the required line in the middle in order to try to fix the situation because they are peace lovers and peacemakers now somebody that's not even willing to admit their own part much less step over the fifty-fifty line more than likely they're not born again in the first place they're just saying they're a Christian they come to church and they brag on the preaching this and that and the other but if the Holy Ghost is in you he is a peacemaker if the Holy Ghost is in you he is a dev well praise the Lord he loves peace he cannot stand arguing and fussing he cannot stand debating come on children don't get wife that's right brother brems said God doesn't fuss and neither do his children so you wonder what that makes people that fuss all the time well praise the Lord but we're having a good time tonight a way hey man this is really good thank the Lord now I want you to notice this now that we go from from verse 1 into this verse 2 now you know the way that the song Solomon is written this is actually called canticles or the Hebrew words that identify that canticles it's also called the song of songs which I'd like to take that out in a minute if the Lord will help me before we finish this on being the song of songs but we don't know how much of a time increment is between verse 1 and verse 2 now in verse 1 we see the great consummation of the marriage how that they've my they've been through this dating and all this it's been ongoing now for maybe months or maybe even longer than that the Hebrew customers at least a year to make sure that the woman was not with child so at the same thing in the scripture that the Bible condenses his truth so even though verse 1 verse 2 verse 3 verse 4 there can be months in between one verse or there can be even months or years in between one word and another as Isaiah 6th you want so we don't know exactly how long it was in between verse 1 and verse 2 but we know that verse one was the consummation that all oh it was wonderful he had come into his garden he went back out of his garden actually retrieving the verge of the tokens of virginity and he told his friends to rejoice and eat because his bride was truly a virgin now as he comes back in verse two was it the same night was it a week later was it forty days later depending on our rich they were the marriage feast and the marriage celebration would go from three days to seven to ten some would go thirty so it's really hard to say as far as time wise but what we see happening now in verse two is that the bridegroom had gone out and it maybe it got late in the night and something had come about but we see a slack or a are you backing all from the fervency in the fault of the bride now again it is not the bridegroom that is at fault but it is totally and completely the bride now this this coldness this complacency this dilatory attitude that was just now got into it does not change who she is but what it does change is her behavior in the way that she is not relating to her husband now keep in mind what I said when I started this out that as I've seen it with men and women husbands and wives that they will look at one another and treat one another different and act different in my at one time they so loved one another and they they wanted to spend their life with this man or this woman more than anybody else and now they don't care if they even like him or not as a matter of fact they wish they'd get away from them because they ain't got no peace in their home so they're just ready to do whatever they got to do to get away from what's just a sad scenario now in this now we can see the reciprocating part of this in the bride that something has now come over the bride in the song song you know breaks my heart to have to bring this but it is truth and reality because the converted part of us always stays in the divine fellowship of God but the unconverted part the human part the human element is that which we all battle is that which we all war against and by the grace of God we're going to overcome it because we're doing it now we're not just waiting out to hide overcome I'm living an overcoming life right now every day of my life now notice this this read verse two again I sleep but my heart waked not once you notice that the bride has not entered into a the deepest sleep by which her subconscious is totally taken over now we know God made a phenomenal thing when he made the human body and he knew that so much of the motors and the things about the body would have to be committed to the subconscious do you ever worry when you lay down at night about who's gonna make your body breathe or who's going to keep your heart rate and your blood pressure fluctuating all because God committed much of the Motorworks of your brain and all the things inside of your body to the subconscious so when you go out of the first conscience and you enter in into the sleep faces and four different phases of sleep by which you go from the light on down into the deeper channels of sleep and once you're entered into that it takes something to wake you up but what does God do God committed so much of the operation of the body that does not depend upon the conscience level so you don't have to set up all night and make sure that you're breathing correctly you don't have to set up all night to make sure that your heart's okay and your kidneys is okay yeah you know everything else is alright why because God committed much of that to the subconscious what a wonderful father so one your they are sleep and you're enjoying your sleep and resting then your body is now moved over once it enters into the life stage of sleep into the deepest part of the sleep stage then your body your heart rate slows and your blood pressure doing all these things but it's operating exactly as it's supposed to while you're in this sleep chamber while you moved into that now how did it not been that way than you and I have never been able to go out sleep or we've been worried about it all not long but you know what most of you probably never even thought about that in your life till now you know why because it's committed to the sub-conscience and you don't even worry about it so not the bride here in this state it is not that she's entered into the deepest part of sleep many of you that have problems with sleeping you've read on and said it on it and you know there can be a lack of melatonin and serotonin it can be all kinds of different things that causes if they make us sleep machines that produce and work on the bed it beta waves of your brain and work on the different phases of your brain that will come in with those sound machines and help you to be able to sleep deeper and deeper and deeper but yet God whenever he made us he made a perfect thing when he made a human being and then whatever the bride now she's not actually so deep into that that once she hears his voice that she's not sorted in and out and most of us have been there to worry that we're going to sleep when we're trying to go to sleep and we're starting enter into it make Harold talk many times we go home after the service and and at night we lay there and talk about the word and talk about so many things and maybe she'll start to enter into it a little bit before I do and I'll say something and then she doesn't respond well I know that she's already entering in deeper than I am or shoot her the same thing to me and it's the same way to where we see the bride that she says I sleep but my heart wake us it is the voice of my beloved so she's entering into into the state of sleep but it is not the sleep of spiritual death it is not that she can no longer hear the voice of the bridegroom but it's sort of like she's halfway asleep and a half way late now she's going from the conscious level into the subconscious and when we do something naturally happens to us because we cannot be alert and both consciences in the full effect at the same time so we have to let go and let go I'm not going we turn and turn you know how they are we make our nests and we can't get comfortable and we do this and we put the pillow this way in that way and I don't know one that isn't my goodness all of you that just lay down and go to sleep in two minutes what do you take Oh hallelujah what a blessed person you are I turn from the left side to the right side on my back I gotta move my leg this way move it that way to get my arm right I get my leg right and then my arm and then I move my arm and I move this and you know it's just back and forth so whatever I'm still in the conscience level and I'm impatient for the subconscious to take over and take me out because I'm tired I need to rest but I'm not worried that the bride is in that sense spiritually because I'm still very much conscious so if I hear something a car goes up and down the road or the neighbor over there shuts his car door then then I hear all that but the bride has actually moved beyond this level a little bit to where she's going deeper and deeper to where the subconscious is now taking over so she says I sleep but my heart waked notice now as she separates herself from her heart she's conscience enough to know that there is OMA there is two people of her and one of them is already struggling it is already entering into this dubious type of state of complacency but the other part was she identifies as her heart I sleep but my hard way cos my heart is hearing his voice but I'm sleeping ahoo I have a body that's who that's the same person that you are as well now notice she said I sleep but my heart waker so she's Highfill wakers will say and half asleep so Christ and the church have feasted they have enjoyed one another's presence they have been my together they spent all this time together and then he goes out as I said well there was the same night or this if then happened a few weeks later I to their marriage or a few months or maybe even a few years but something had already begin to move inside of the heart will say the new begin to wear off you know there is a commonality about monogamy even in the natural marriage state and this is why that many people like to have affairs so their life becomes old and you know they become common on another and they don't love one another that much anymore so then somebody at work will catch their eye don't y'all sit and look at me like you know what I'm talking about somebody at work or somebody at school or something like that well catch their eye and maybe they're not quite as much in love with her husband or wife as they were years ago so this person MA brings a little spark back into their life it's the same way spiritually that people come to the house of God the spark as well the violence of their passion the violence of their prayer life so they just kind of settle down and they go to church and they clap their hands or mother Lewis says everybody clap your hands and they clap their hands but there's no passion there's no real burning inside of them they are going through a ritual and emotion that's all and they are in a form people st. a forum it's just like this there are forms that move you ever see a curved driveway poured out of concrete now if the arable thing in that form was straight and nothing was mobile you'll never get a curve in a driveway but guess what you got you got hinges so you got a form but that form moves some people get in the form like this or like this Sylla form what they're doing it without heart they're doing about that attachment to the Lord Jesus a man can kiss his wife come out seeing the same thing okay say the same but 20 years ago my goodness he'd grab him and another one that's why folks you should be about God oh I can't wait to get to church oh I can't wait to get alone with God I can't wait to listen to another tape praise the Lord she now finds herself in this state to where that she's struggling was sleep notice she's a a answering to the parallel of the disciples and that's in 26 verse 40 he cometh unto the disciples and find us in asleep and saith unto Peter what could you not watch with me one hour Watson pray that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but uh can you say Amen about that being yours bought Peters flesh no no no don't leave it in Peters lap put it in yours your flesh is weak well the only I got to hold a goose your flesh ain't got it he went away again the second time and prayed saying O my father if this cup may not pass away from me except I drink it thy will be done and he came and found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy but the sleep of God's people is never total it is never totally concerned to them that they are like the world with one they cannot be awakened out of their sleep thank God thank God though the bride is asleep now though the bride here Peter James John Matthew Bartholomew you know whoever was that was there they were asleep if the Lord Jesus ever needed them to be praying for him to be of moral support sustaining the Lord we don't understand what's going on but we're with you what behind you all the way and he tells him cannot you watch with me one hour and he goes and comes back and what does he find the same thing again and if all the times he needed them what did he find his hair was wet the locks of his hair is dripping with the night Dew and what did he find his bride asleep was it his fault not at all was it his shortcoming not at all now let me remind you again unless you men here tonight or God don't you never never come and sit in my office and projector scheffers mean faultless cuz you're a lying hypocrite don't none of you and I never set yourself in my office nobody no preacher no deacon cuz we're full of faults we're full of thoughts come on yeah I know some of you ain't lack in there but I'm gonna say it cuz the Holy Ghost said say it oh ma who was the faulty one Peter our Jesus it was the faulty one shiner Jesus oh ma whose fault is our you ain't no closer to God's honor my wife my uncle my brother-in-law the pastor the church yeah there you go point the finger hurts do your self Oh My Lord Jesus help me God in a believers wife state spiritual life and love more still there's you better thank God - not for predestination I know some of you struggle with it one of these days you're gonna look back and you're gonna realize you're stinking free moral agency nearly got you lost if God will left us to our own choice they probably be one of us sitting in this place tonight it was God's mercy that saved us let me tell you one thing you are just a mercy God that saved this is a mercy God that keeps us it's the mercy of God that forgives us of our slothfulness oh ma Oh hallelujah the flash of the believer it's the only thing asleep so the bride hears his voice but it is the heart to hear sit how can the heart here brother David it's the hidden man of the heart that hears but now listen the world itself sometimes is not enough to wait the bride from her sleepiness now I'm going to say that ahead of it and let you think on it for a little bit her soul filled with the Holy Ghost oh she loves him she loves him but how believers need to distinguish as this Shulamite did I sleep but heart my heart stirs as I don't care if you're a preacher if you're a deacon if you're evangelist if you're a world-renowned individual there's gonna come spots in your life and your walk with God you're gonna need refilling and you're gonna need a stirring amen now we all know our flesh cannot be trusted Romans chapter 8 verse 1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and verse 4 says that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit galatians 5:16 this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh you mean a person a born-again child of God has the ability of fulfilling the lust of the flesh if you believe what Paul said you did notice again the ungracious chapter 5 verse 17 for the flesh lusteth against the spirit capitalist and the spirit against the flesh and these things are contrary one to the other amen so that ye cannot do the things that ye would why because one is against the other why because neither Homer isn't this neither one of them is in the state of perfection even though you're born again tonight you are still limited by your humanity and your immortality and your soul can not do fully what it wants to do it wants to be annecy off on it it wants to be in the eternal bliss of the heaviness and yet it cannot be because it's held captive in this body of time and your body cannot do everything at once today because it's got a new king sitting on the throne of your heart some need a lot of them can do what they completely wanted her [Applause] [Music] so she takes a bath she goes over to the bed she puts off her day clothes butts on her night class maybe every intention was to stay awake for him she loved him she wanted to Ben what's the scene when he came in but she wasn't sure what time he was coming back they rarely thought it's 1977 but now she found that it wasn't them and then the thought is two thousand one and two thousand whatever whatever you know so she just wasn't really sure because he never told her exactly the day or the hour when he was going to come so she tried to set him he'll night since she's just sitting up reading just really your eyes ever cross when you get to that point I'm just gonna slide down the bed I'm not going to sleep okay I'm not going to sleep I'm waiting for him but I'm just gonna scoot down in this bed and she slid down in that tempur-pedic or whatever this she had oh my the pillow was so cozy I said Courtney there's a little they used to come to our house and stay they don't do it anymore now they're growing up so they don't not come to our house and say no more Courtney would come and should stay and should turn and flop and wallow and Carol say Courtney honey what's the matter she said I can't get comfortable I can't get comfortable but I need a lot of folks problem they got to come from all I swear the Lord has to kick us out of our comfort zone sometimes yeah it's a shame early but we have to have it she had no intention I'm gonna sleep she's gonna wait on him I mean my goodness this is the love of her life the brother feels she just slides on down a little more mattress oh this pillow feels so good but I'm not going to say not me absolutely not I see show me all fight it that way in church I mean you pinch yourself your wife will gouge on the side it's a wonder to me some of your brothers ain't got broke ribs it's just a bit of dramatizing this I'm off at a half every sleep well y'all can't sleep - not relive this okay relive this drama of going into sleep and all of a sudden miss you close their eyes and nope I'm not going to this I am absolutely not going to their work and she just drifts oh I can't do this okay I've got to be on fire we're in the last days wars and rumors of wars and talks of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs and I've got to stay awake I've gotta stay awake I've worked so hard today I don't anybody understand how difficult my life is I'm the only one in the world is having a difficult life no you're not [Applause] and finally she just came fighting no more and she found that spot and then she's in she's out and she hears something it's almost like she's in a dream she's not a prophet of course so she don't worry the prophetic or I'm a vision but it's like she's in a dream you've had drinks before and you come in and out of them and parts of them come out with you because the brother man said there's a part of you that's in that dream so it's sort of like she's in a dream is it a dream or is it is it real so she's she's asleep but she hears faintly open up sweetheart open up she's what what well I must be dreaming no I'm all right I'm good I'm good if things fine now I'm good open now what open up I'm asleep but in my heart is this the same girl that said my beloved suck the Rose of Sharon and the lily of the valley my beloved is this and this and all my she just went on and on and on now she hears him and she said what what you say was she was not fast asleep as a matter of fact she still had a candle burning she was wise so she still had a light burning by her bedside so she was not in the in the last stage of sleep tour she's gone out to where subcon since it's finally kitchen in the beta waves have moved now inside of a brain and now the brain has calmed all these things down inside of her body and now she's entered into that deep sleep zone she's still going in and she's got this light going she can never sleep with alive anyway so she got this like going in and still they're honest she's not dead and saying you understand she is not sleeping like the lamb she is not dead and sin the way they are but she's just not where she needs to be she is not a new judicial slumber given to her by the Almighty God but which she's entered into the point of no return that she'll never know right from wrong again she's just snoring and now she's and now she's not not in universities finally submitted to that stage and it's just kind of overtaking her this phrase that she used it's a phrase used to describe a sluggish slothful human being a little sleep a little slumber Solomon said a little folding of the hands so is the way of the sluggard they're indifferent to lukewarm and to sluggish about divine things they content themselves with the bare necessities of religion to comfort and ease the conscience while still believe in God I still believe in the message or her brother no he's a good man absolutely but I'm just having some problems right now so she's entered into this state now listen friend it will be worse for us than any other age because of the spirit of our age being the spirit of Laodicea and no other age was Jesus put out of the church like he wasn't our age can I have a few more minutes revelation 3:14 it says unto the Angel of the Church of the Laodiceans write these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I know thy works thou art neither cold nor hot I would the tower cold nor hot so then because thou art lukewarm neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth in other words that make God fond it may God sick of his stomach what's this a prophet says it this way God said I'd rather you'd be hot real red-hot Tyler finally I'd rather you'd be real red hot or freezing be one or the other don't get lukewarm cuz you make me sick that's what this church age does for God it makes him sick my goodness oh my either be red hot or don't be lukewarm warm or hot cuz you make me vomit the chilliness of the Anglian Church and the days of John Wesley drove him to have meetings elsewhere because it was cold chilly friends people are starving to death for love believe me I've dealt with enough people who's been in extramarital affairs to know that a cold husband or a cold wife can turn a marriage into utter hell on earth praise the Lord a cold mother and father can raise cold children turn them into murderers people are starving to death enough I come at this early GUI Laodicea stuff I'm talking about real love real love will correct you when you're wrong but the real real loss we were made to be loved but not only made to be loved we were made to love I am convinced many many many people who live on the face of this earth today do not understand the first principle of how to love another human being they love them with selfishness they love them with a scale and if they do this and this and this for that individual they expected the same thing to be done on their side and they're always weighing I've done this and this and this and this and this for you the real love of God keeps no record you're scared to death you're gonna do more for her than she does for you insist you're scared to death you're gonna do a little more for him than he does back for you you need to be feeling the Holy Ghost you need to have the love of God cause the love of God don't keep her rocker can you imagine God keeping a record of what you've done for him versus what he's done for you can you imagine how the scale would be lopsided I'm the Chernus of the England Church in the days of John Wesley drove him to have meetings elsewhere because it was cold and chilly the chilliness of the Methodist Church cause William Booth to become a red-hot salvation astir but amber there's William booths they become quite violent that's right all right he wants you read harder freeze and one of the other don't be lukewarm don't just don't pretend something that you haven't God either be on fire for God had gone back into the organization don't be lukewarm it may sound awful to you but let me tell you something friend I'm glad some of these unbelievers have been sent around the message for years and year that went back to their old dog vomit that's why they belong in the first place they didn't bomb among us our foods too rich that's right Laodicea makes him sick eagle food makes them sick so you're gonna be sick one or the other either that he's gonna be on fire with God oh my what is this again mark of the beast we see him when Daniel saw he come at ten thousand ten ten thousands of his Saints is that right and the books were opened another book was opened which is the book of life and every man there comes up you're lukewarm Church this is what they're called sleeping virgin you see if you stay in a lukewarm condition it shows you're not bright can the bride get lukewarm oh yes machine will stay there y'all ever have lukewarm times in your marriage you folks at them that imagine time to raise your hand let you know things are stress and maybe financial difficulties and whatever more but you know what you love one another more than you you want to let the stress stop you know because you come back to the very foundation we loved one another we married because we loved one another we are not going to let these things separate our love that's the way we ought to feel about Christ Jesus he loves you you loved him you didn't come to him because of blessings you didn't come to him because he promised everything was going to be good you come there because he loves you and you loved him then trials and tests and tribulation and persecution they were to separate you from the love of God because you love him more than trouble you love him more than heartaches notice again he said these two messengers out sending messages went in there and Lord had to give his message now notice these two messengers these two angels they come the Lord and tell him what God's fixing to do Locke goes out and still try to tell the sodomites so God's gonna destroy this place he goes and tells his family notice he says Lord had to give his message but it didn't sound did nothing to them they didn't pay any attention to him cause the life he had lived proved it lukewarm church till you want to tell your children the importance of the message you want to raise them up and the message how do you live at home now your your fussing and fighting is carrying on and you want to tell them about the truth lord have mercy y'all see me on the side of the road Monday will preach for food I'll probably voted out after this notice this they didn't pay no attention to him because the life he lived proven lukewarm Church even his own children didn't believe in him now this is what a man or a woman that continues in lukewarmness this is what it proves you lose your testimony even in your own home what difference does it make of we all thank your Saints and your children I got a lick of confidence in Jesus Jesus notice again the countdown listen when he he would spews them when they got lukewarm and it's spewing time he rejects that he takes the remnant out of it and the countdowns over and the astronaut is gone for the heavens oh my brother sister by God's grace I am NOT going to be spewed out how many's going with me we're not going to be spewed out I refuse all brother Donnie have you ever needed that time in your life absolutely I give and give and give and give and I give so much of my life to very selfish people let me tell you some of the message people are some of the most selfish people I've ever seen in my life they'll kill you they'll preach you to death and sends you home nearly dead in the casket but all they want is your gift and all my you ain't really a works on y'all tell your friends but I refuse to let people pulling on me pulling on me determine my attitude oh let me take some I could ride not a book I could write volumes of books of the way that I've been treated by people in this senescence but you know what I refuse to let them control my joy I refuse to let them control my - God will never make me answer for your attitude but it will make me answer for mine and I want to have the rhyme but that's right notice this again gods provide a place of worship now we're seated together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus in Christ Jesus setting in there listen to this I love this setting in there that great seat that's already fired up hey man the astronaut seat you're sitting on is already fired up we just need to get some of the fire off the seat and us this great astronaut seat is already final Oh glory been raised from the dead and we are part of it if you're part of the bride you are because the bride is a part of the groom you know so we find out it's exactly the same thing and she'll do exactly what he predicted for her to do in this day she won't be a letter CL not by no means lukewarm but she'll be on fire for God she'll be moving on in the spirit of God [Applause] mr. Wayne God but about 50 some more pages but what happened what happened to her laughs her see her great adjectives of love about which she described him and how she felt I believe she was almost I believe she felt this way about him but something that happened it's hard for me to believe this is a one-time incident same way it is with you and Alan we get cold indifferent it ain't just a one-time deal and no doubt it lab was led up by this and this let go of this that go of that rearranging priorities and the next thing you know you're still going to church and you're still picking up the same books and listening the same tapes occasionally but you're not connecting like you did before are you asleep are you hearing this voice but yet it's not enough to rouse you she heard his voice as well look at in the morning if I get to preach to Kim tomorrow she heard his voice and it it did move her but it did not arouse her but you know what it was that actually finally got a hold of her that moved her it was when she saw his hand so I put his hand to the hole in the door the doors are not like ours today but they would have a hole in there about which a family member would be able to come in and know the trips and the be able to open it up so she heard his word and heard his word and heard his word but when she saw his hand and his hand came through the hole in the door you tell that to mercy of God he is so determined to get her attention his voice speaks and it still doesn't do it for so the hand of God moved in her life when she was undeserving how many times have we heard his word heard his word heard his word heard his word and that didn't shake us that didn't it always said Amen I know I need to do better I know I need to do it and what does God do the hand of God will move in right not always in correction and chastisement just whooping the fire out of you but the Spirit of God would just move on your heart and soften that a hard shell that you've turned into and was the hand of God dripping with summer we got our attention then she began to wake up in her house well their heads bowed and no one looking around her I wonder if there'd be one or let me now set that way I wonder how many there would be I would like to say to the Lord Lord I want to stir out of this slumber Lord I love you though my heart Lord odda I don't want to be lukewarm I don't want to be indifferent just raise your hand to God god bless you I may be many of you tonight or not in slumber but you'd say brother Donny I really need a stern III just I need a refill it would you like to raise your hand to God mine goes up on that a man mister spare heads together now I want you to hold your requests before the Lord maybe you're not even sure what you need but you felt like this word God spoke to your heart Heavenly Father we approach you tonight as the faulty flawed imperfect bride that we are we know in our souls in Christ Jesus we are without fault it's a mystery really the word can come and it can preach us to the highest heavens to where we feel like at any moment we're going to be changed and the very next service that word will come it will bring us so low we feel like we could crawl out from underneath the door but Lord we know it's because it's the two parts of us and then we need this kind of preaching it shows us either the flesh has got the upper hand or you're warning us that it's fixing to whichever Lord I don't question you know these are not my favorite type of sermons to preach but after all I don't work for myself I'll work for you this is not the favorite type of sermon for them to hear from their pastor but after all I don't work for them so therefore we have assembled ourselves that we might hear from heaven I believe we've heard from heaven this night or it was not deep it did not make them sit on the edge of their seat and they were spellbound by great deep words that I had to say but Lord God I believe you spoke to our hearts from the least to the greatest from the deacon to the preachers to whoever more to those that were able to stream tonight father I pray you at searches Lord oh Jesus help us I pray is this prophecy was this a prophetic utterance that was written in verse 2 to warn us as the people of God that this time would come and for us to be prepared you not only warned us of destruction and devastation I believe you desire to warn us coldness and indifference the atomic bombs of Russia will never affect us Lord but lukewarmness certainly can or we get all tore up about North Korean Lord no never Hillary was running we got all Torah people in the message prophesy and she is gonna win and all kinds of things they got all tore up about it never even happened and yet they'll set lukewarm and never even stir them at all and lukewarmness will be the thing that can keep them out of the promise helped us tonight I pray father would you begin with me Lord Jesus look in my heart and see if you see anything Lord that displeases you search me Oh God begin up on the platform look at every musician search ever preacher ever Deacon ever lay men we have a person in the nursery those in the sound booth those streaming Lord God those that will go back and archive this service may have a heart be searched may you do a scan on ass Lord as it were Passover's tonight Lord God do you find a coalesce a complacency an indifference oh god help us tonight father Lord Jesus we love you we ask you to forgive us I'm so glad you understand that we are mortal I'm so glad that you understand thank you for coming to this earth and living in this kind of a body that you yourself would even go to the Garden of Gethsemane and pray that the cup you were about to go through would pass if possible thank you lord thank you lord you understood the frailty of humanity help us turn out Lord God would you [Music] alleluia alleluia thank you Lord Jesus Thank You Lord Jesus but you turn and lay your hand on the person of standard value let's just offer a word of Prayer can we for each other now this time you're not praying for yourself but you're praying for that young man young woman older brothers sister middle-aged whatever they are standing by by you maybe there aren't that low spot in their life and they've heard the word and they know it's true and maybe they've tried to shake their self but the king but what if God would use your hand God would borrow your hand and it would be the extension of the hand of God praise the Lord Jesus hallelujah evany father you know every individual here tonight as we have her hands laid one upon the other eagle - eagle believe it - believer may the Holy Spirit flows through the body from one member to another Lord maybe some just sounds so low they don't know what to do they just think why should I even go on I'm also just give up but Lord I pray you to encourage them tonight father help them Lord to realize they'll never be satisfied lukewarm they'll never be satisfied going back out there in the world there's only one place for them that's Bethel the house of God Alleluia we are not called to Laodicea we are called to Bethel Bethel it's where we come from Bethel it's where we must come back to the house of God or Jesus may we say it is the Shulamite I sleep but my heart wake us it is the voice of my beloved that I hear and I'm trying to arouse myself I'm trying to stir I'm trying my best and then my response is full of excuses oh god help us even then your mercy is so great hallelujah help us tonight Oh God he who could have knocked the door down but instead of knocking it down he knocked on it he who could have demanded an entrance and Sid begged for one praise God Wow she was still bright or blessed be the name of God she was still bright praise the Lord Jesus Oh blessed father Lord if we've been that way tonight we open Lord Jesus we grab our clothes we get up from the bed forget our feet forget
