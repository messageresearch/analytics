herself ready I want to don't you I want to do my part but I don't want to get in trouble you know and mess up trying to get in his part neither do I want to be lazy and try him to get to do what I'm supposed to do so it's a delicate type of thing but I think he'll help us don't you God bless you happy to be together tonight in the house of the Lord aren't you enjoying these 50° days praise the Lord so some of y'all singled digigit people are you you wasn't smiling well you can call me an old soft if you want to now I understand why people go to Florida in the winter time and Louisiana and places like that you know God bless you let's turn together tonight if you would we'll read from a couple places in in the scripture Proverbs 16:28 eight for our first reading and then Galatians 6:7 I want to speak tonight again about seed for the rain seed for the rain and keep this in mind that whenever you're talking about seed for yourself and us doing the things that are right that you're not just sewing that seed for you as a matter of fact I may not get to it tonight but the prophet of God said that you parents you live right and influence your children right it can influence your children and your grandchildren yes and then he quotes scripture for it whenever Abraham paid tithes to mzc but yet it was attributed to Levi and Levi was only a SE Gene in Abraham's loins it a't one of the devil don't want us to do good things is it Proverbs 16:28 a forward man Seth strife and a Whisperer separateth Chief friends now I know this is not very deep and I realize that for a lot of folks if you're not screaming seven Thunders and you know that sort of thing that think you're not preaching the message but I wonder sometimes myself if we would maybe spend a little bit more time reading this Bible and finding out what's in it we'd be a whole lot better people let's read that again a forward man Seth Strife so this is what a forward man does so this is a man of contention a man who's a troublemaker so a forward man Seth strife and a Whisperer separateth Chief friends now Galatians 6: 7 be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever man Seth that shall he also reap for he that Seth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption so never remember we're talking about Christians non-christians denominational people message people because we all fit into that particular category and the way that Paul is writing wring in here it's not well this is only sinners now Christians can do whatever they want to do this law don't apply to them no it actually applies to us as a matter of fact you'll find the prophet telling us I think it was Christ's mystery in July maybe July 28 63 something like that whenever he talks about coming back into the valley there in Jeffersonville and he said as soon as he would enter in the valley it would become real spooky and dark and he would break out in hives and he said the reason was because he still made it hard on him because he didn't go out the first time when God meant for him to so here is a prophet that has lived all of these years after that initial failure by listening to his mother-in-law instead of listening to God and he's still dealing with that thing makes you want to se good seed don't it for he that Seth to his flesh so your flesh is a garden and the will of God is another Garden which is your partakers of your soul so he that Seth to his flesh shall of the flesh so we can't sow to the Flesh and reap from the soul neither can we sow to the soul and reap corruption from the flesh so the seed itself is not the only part that we need to look at but where we sew it so we could take the message scripture study you know religious things great things that are principles of the truth and seow them to the Flesh and it still is not what we need we need to make our flesh obey yes but the seed needs to be sown in our soul remember I'm talking about the woman at the well spoken words Original Seed and he said that that woman I'm sorry not the woman at the well but Mary and he said that Mary said that my mother or her mother was O blind an Anna and she said my mother placed a seed in my heart from her lips to help her to believe that word now remember he's not talking about predestinated see cuz we can't do that but her mother planted a seed of the promised word of her day in her heart and she waited and waited and waited and that seed actually of the word god used her mother to be able to do it oh my for he that sth to his flesh shall love the flesh reap corruption but he that Seth to the spirit now this is a new testament Greek word which is Numa which is where we get pneumatics and different things like that from but it is the spirit of God it's not just human Spirit but it is the spirit of God you notice it's capital letter but he that Seth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting let me read this quote to you that I read to you last Wednesday night but you reap what you sow just be aware of that people whether you are a nation or a church or an individual you reap what you s let's look at it again but you reap what you sow just be aware of that people whether you are a nation or a church or an individual you reap what you s now you and I may not comprehend this to the fullest extent yet of what the devil already knows about this law you see the devil understands if he can get one generation in the 20s to start sewing about the flappers y'all remember the flappers what the flappers were in the 20s and the 30s the devil knew if he could get the flappers sewn in the 20s then the strip tees and the Hollywood would come on in the Next Generation and then the next generation and we're blaming on the devil and in one sense of course it is the devil but the devil knows human beings will actually help fulfill his program because he gives it to them and they sew it and do these things but Satan knows they don't but Satan knows that what comes out of them and so and their children will be worse in the Next Generation Now notice what he says that whether you're a nation or a church or an individual you reap what you sell let's pray together Heavenly Father we thank you tonight for your word dear God I pray you would open our hearts to it tonight Lord Jesus teach us father we're here at your table tonight we've come hungry Lord I'm so happy to be in church tonight I love going to church I love singing I love worshiping I love praying we love hearing the preaching of the word to speak to us tonight father shut my mouth to anything that would displease you I pray in Jesus name amen amen God bless you you may be seated we know that much of what the new birth does by the Regeneration of the soul and it every potential of everything that you'll ever be is in that seed when it's born by the Breath of God if you haven't listened to Blasphemous names yet in 1962 you hear the prophet talking about that that the Church of the Living God is actually born by the breast of God so all of your potential spiritually are in that seed once it becomes born again some of it may take years for it to develop some of it may be right before you're passing from this Earth that it'll finally be developed in that last stage and as a SE my open comments that what we want to find is that balance in our life and in our walk with god with the part that we're supposed to do and then the part the ministry is supposed to do for us and then the part the spirit of God living in us will do and all of it contributes together and makes this beautiful beautiful plan that God has ordained for each of our lives and us being able to separate between all of that now there's certain things that you will need in your walk with God that you will not be able to provide for yourself that's why God give you a pastor and then there'll be other things that God will send in evangelists visiting ministers and they'll come and speak for us and they'll go down a certain Avenue and you say oh praise the Lord that was just exactly what I needed I never heard that before in my life I just preached it to you three weeks before that but I said it in a different way than the way the visiting Minister did and it was exactly the way you needed to hear it and then you got something out of that service now you could have studied you could have listened to tapes every day and and you get things out of them yet yes but God has allocated a certain element of it to come through the five-fold ministry it's just his plan and then there's an element of it that if you will listen to the tapes and you'll be aware of what the men of God are preaching if they're really preaching the message that is then whenever you hear that you say I just heard that I just heard that yesterday oh yes praise the Lord and I had this question about it Oh Praise You Lord oh thank you Lord it really really helped me well you see if you had not been listening to that then that have been an element of it that you wouldn't have got so you do your part preacher does his part Holy Ghost does his part Evangel as his and then all of that brings every one of us into this stature of what God wants us to be now then there's a negative side about this these Divine virtues that are in Us by the spirit of God God once they are there God will allow us to be Tried by circumstances sometimes people and he will let us see where we are on the growth chart now all of you parents know when I was a child I I don't remember ever being measured I never did hard to ever go to the doctor whenever I was a child anyway but I mean I've took my granddaughter's son and see them do the growth chart and they'll say Well they're above you know they're above the N9 percentile or whatever more yeah they're right in that certain certain thing well what do they do that for well they want to weigh your child they want to be able to get their height and this and that and be able to tell you where they are poor bless her heart she was always a runt she was always under never did grow up past that she was always well beneath it but she had a lot of character to make up for what she lacked in Heights so that's the way we are when it comes spiritually we go to the house of God and then the men of God anointed by the spirit of God they'll begin to lay out the chart and the chart of course the the ultimate example on the chart is the Lord Jesus and then they begin to lay out and the spirit of God will individualize and convict our hearts and say Lord I'm short of this and I'm short of that what's God trying to do he's trying to show us where we are on the percentile now there might be some ahead of you there might be some behind you and there might be some that's equal to you but no matter where you are don't be discouraged and think you'll never make it yes if God has started that work in you he will perform it to the day of Jesus Christ and the church said now when we think about some of the things then that we can do and remember the terminology is so important in the Bible and if you'll be really careful when you Le read it and ask the spirit of God as you're reading your Bible reading the message book listen to it tap whatever it is that God will open your understanding let's read now if you would in Ephesians 4:30 let's look at some more seeds now that this spirit of God is going to give us the admonition tonight that we will have to seow grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed until the day of redemption I want you to notice Paul is writing to people with the Holy Ghost so a person without the Holy Ghost cannot grieve the spirit of God the way a person with the Holy Ghost can Oh you mean brother Donnie people with the Holy Ghost we will make mistakes and fall short of the glory of God well if they can't Paul wrote a lie in Ephesians 4:30 how many believes you got the Holy Ghost how many of you know that you've grieved the spirit of God before and you've had to repent and make it right sure spirit of God called brother Bram alar you're going to say brother B didn't have the Holy Ghost you're dumber than I am I ain't going to say no such thing but yet there's something that a child of God can grieve it a sinner can't grieve the Holy Ghost like that he's not inside of them even a Sanctified person can't grieve the spirit of God the way someone with the Holy Ghost does grieve not the holy spirit of God now who's this speaking to it ain't speaking to the Holy Ghost it ain't speaking to the pastor it's speaking to the individuals who have the Holy Ghost so who can grieve your portion of the Holy Ghost only you who can grieve my portion only me brother Paul who can grieve your portion brother Rob only brother Rob so G grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed until the day of redemption let all bitterness now once in the Avenue that Paul chooses to go here I Believe by the spirit of God so he's going to give us examples of what people can do to grieve the spirit of God let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you now why would he tell the people that because the spirit of God is not going to do this now I can tell you what you need to do but I can't do it for you the your Sunday school teachers the youth leaders all of that deacons trustees no every fold of the ministry could tell you but they cannot do it for you so you're the only one in your own walk with God that can take these things and put them come away from you now the spirit of God will help you because some of these things are tough some of these things are tough now let all bitterness look at this word it's a strange word it's p so it is bitter G or a Bitter Root and so producing a bitter fruit that's equivalent to this other word which is mirror which was used in the Hebrew in the Old Testament mirror denoting that that which is bitter hence the term is applied to bile or G the fluid secreted by the liver it is also used of poison so Paul chooses this word in order to identify bitterness that a child of God can let get in their heart and it would cause the spirit of God to be grieved now it's also used and and poison of the serpents in job 20 verse4 which is of course the poison ass which the Ancients erroneously believe was gone so Believers are to get rid of the five vices of bitterness now the spirit of God won't do it for you he will help you keep in mind he will help us do things we cannot do but he will never do for us what we're supposed to do ourself and he will never ask us to do things he knows we cannot do he will never do that now watch so coming with this notice in the scripture now that he said let all bitterness and wrath now he's going to name wraths anger clamor and evil speaking put away with the fifth one which is malice so notice W and it is the Greek word Simon which means Outburst of anger Outburst of anger now I've done s myself up tonight and I've been working on myself now for several hours all evening that it's okay if I don't get no amens tonight so I'm going to go ahead and preach with Adam so I'm not going to put no pressure on y'all to say Amen so if I get any I mean if I pass out y'all just you know just say God help him and give him strength notice says so Simon is outburst of anger now this is things that Grieves the Holy Spirit Outburst of anger now as I said this is not deep this is not seven Thunder preaching this is not parosa preaching and and this is not Miracle preaching and signs and wonders and all of that but either we fulfill this word or we miss going that's in the Rapture am so to me this is pretty important what good does it do us to think we're message people and we're bride people and we can't even fulfill scriptures in the Bible I can see why a lot of preachers Don't Preach this because they can't do it theirself amen come on praise the Lord now what so Paul uses is the word WRA now he moves over to anger which is the Greek word orgate settled feeling of anger and brawling woo that sounds rough to me and then he uses the word climber CR which is shouting or crying now this is coming out of bitterness now and then he moves over to evil speaking I was so shocked when I looked at the Greek word that is used for evil speaking blasphemia so it's blasphemy railing slander injur speech injury speech to another's good name so then Christians talking about one another and running down their brothers and their sisters or preachers or whatever it is that they do and they do it with that intent in mind to injure their sister's character or their good name or their brothers and then he uses the word malice Kaka ill will desire to injure evil naughtiness malignity so here it moves into this stage of malice now this is what bitterness can unfold in an individual's life if they don't ask God to take it out so bitterness leads to WRA which is the explosion on the outside of feelings that are on the inside now of course there's nobody here in the building tonight that is guilty of any of this but as you all know there's some sorry people that stream these services and boy after last Wednesday night some of them sorry outfits they started emailing me and say boy that was for me and it was so needful for me and I need help with this family member and that family member and this and that and the other and I I'm just so sorry sorry for you poor little innocent people here that God would just torment you all and and make you have to set under this kind of preaching for them some of them sorry outfits out there that stream these services so you all just need to join with me in prayer that God will get some of them people out there ready and they'll become more like usen well no maybe on second thought we need to think about how we pray for them and pray that they'll be more like Jesus and not like us so bitterness leads to wrath which is the explosion on the outside of feelings on the inside then wrath and anger can lead to brawling which is clamor or blasphemy which is evil speaking wow but here is the antidote Ephesians 4:32 and be ye kind one to another look at the word cros gracious virtuous good mild pleasant as opposite to harsh hard Sharp and bitter so for everything that God has the devil has one on the other side to try to replace it and everything the devil has God has a whole lot more to give us but the thing of it is it's like we cannot have both at the same time so it's like tradeoffs either we forgive or we forfeit forgiveness amen so it's not like that we can forgive and yet hold grudges and bitterness and all that it's totally impossible you see either we forgive those who trespass against us or we stop the Avenue of our own forgiveness from God now if there's anybody here tonight that's been holding a grudge or bitterness in your heart for say 5 years 10 15 whatever it is do you realize if you've hold something in your heart against people because they've harmed you and done you wrong say five years do you understand that means your own sins have not been forgiven by God for the last five years of your life I hope and pray to God there's nobody here that's that's there but if you are I hope you don't walk out them doors without repent and saying God forgive me now think of it either we forgive or we forfeit forgiveness now some of you may not have a grudge against anyone in this life or anyone in this church but your problem is you haven't forgiven given God you say God yeah because sometimes God will make a decision concerning you or your family or a loved one and you don't understand it and you develop a feeling don't tell me I've dealt with people all over the world that have done it and they get hurt against God and they get this feeling against God and they will not forgive him he ain't never done nothing wrong he don't need forgiveness but do you realize people that come to a spot that they can't forgive it not only affects the person they don't forgive it actually affects them more now watch so Paul said be ye kind one to another my my opposite to harsh hard shot bitter more pleasant benevolent be you kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake do you understand tonight the only reason you are forgiven I am forgiven it's not because we are worthy it's not because we deserve it God forgave us for one reason for Christ s amen you want to know how I forgive people that tell lies on me and do all they've done through the years you don't want to know how I do it it's quite simple yet quite profound I forgive them for Christ's sake even those who will never come and ask me to forgive them including preachers that's good never come and ask me never be man enough to admit that they were wrong and say something they don't have to as far as I'm concerned I can forgive them for Christ's sake but you see the reason some of you cannot forgive is because you're looking at that individual and you think they done so much damage they done this and they done that and they done that not worthy of forgiveness that's the reason you'll never be able to forgive them you're not told to forgive them because they're worthy Paul gives us the example I hope somebody's going to hear me tonight you talking about one of the great mysteries of God functioning in the body that we all need dealing with one another cuz every one of us is sorry rotten piece of junk I mean we're awful mixed up with this and that and the other if it was for the grace of God every one of us i' go to hell and be lost well praise the Lord thank God for grace and we're still stuck with this whole thing after we get converted now notice he said forgiving one another even as even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you praise the Lord ain't this awesome Christianity produces true curiousness and politeness you're have to be rude and be oh my mean and spirited and all that because we believe them Oh Brother Don I run into people I boy I tell you want I tell them where they're going oh no you'll never win Nobody by that let the dove the spirit of God he can do more in five minutes with his presence and you can do in five years with that temper of yours you see it doesn't make us rough and crabbit and sour look at 1 Corinthians 13:4 charity suffereth long and is kind charity envest not charity VA us not itself is not puffed up now if you want to be a puffer fish go ahead but we're not getting a Rapture Ready for pufferfish is for bride people amen now watch he says be ye kind one to another back to Ephesians 4:32 tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you look at the meaning of this word tenderhearted having a heart disposed to pity and compass passion and especially disposed to show kindness not to the kindness of Brothers but to the false you understand how God looks at you you understand how you mediator intercedes for you daily probably for most of us hourly and minutely and secondly what does he say to the father forgive them Father they don't know what they're doing forgive them Father they don't know what they're doing how does our forgiveness come for Christ's sake so Christ Our mediator is not saying oh they're so good they're so sweet oh they're not that no but he's praying for our ignorance that's the key to us being able to forgive those who hurt us so severely and yet by the grace of God living inside of us we can forgive them as Jesus forgave the Roman soldiers for crucifying him although they never ask for forgiveness now watch the watch word here for Christians I want to share these with you these comments here M for all the people is forgive or forfeit forgiveness be a kind one to another and tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake ha forgiven you now I found this amazing in researching this that God for Christ's sake and the Greek is God in Christ it is giving as Christ as perpetuation so God in Christ Christ in you Christ in me now think of it it cost God the death of his son which was his Humanity to forgive us but in reality it cost us nothing to forgive our brothers and sisters but you would think it was costing our every Stitch of clothes we own our car our house our truck our boat our snowmobile our dog our cat our pet mouse oh Lord have mercy if I forgive them it'll cost me everything saying really no I'll tell you who it cost everything the Lord Jesus my my my praise the Lord you see the way when we recognize this it enables us to forgive via the Forgiveness we have received ourself because once you look at it right then the Forgiveness that we have already received are no merits no basis of our own and if we forgive on that basis we forgive like God if we forgive on the basis that we submit this list all right in order for me to forgive you brother Jack you got to go down here and do all 397 of these things and if I think of 97 more I'm going to tack that onto the back sheet and then I'm going check every one of them off and boy I'll tell you one thing you better do every one of them to the letter you're not forgiving the way God forgave you do you understand that God forgives us many times for sins that are in ignorance things that we don't even know that's wrong but he wants us to be so forgiven Hallelujah that he's so willing and you imagine then that comes in the hearts of human beings and many of them were born with an unforgiving Spirit it runs in their family that they will not forgive they will not do it it's just not in them they can't even say they're wrong it's amazing how many Christians I've dealt with that cannot say they are wrong you talking about a proud arrogant person that needs the Holy Ghost I'm such an ignoramus and a dummy and a failure I have no problem saying I'm wrong I said it a lot of times even when I ain't because I'm a peacemaker and some Christians ain't peacemakers so I I can say it I have no problem in saying said it all my life probably say it to the morning the moment before I'm changing this body cuz I'm just a human being I didn't get angel wings like some of y'all did my mother births me I was a renegade I had a naval I guess some of y'all had angelic wings and and you're you you do need get draw sustenance from your mother's cord I I guess you all had spiritual Heavenly IVs that was running down to you all uh so you didn't get no blood from your mama but you got Angelic choirs and you got all these spiritual vitamins you as this bastard born as I was Hell Bound woo pour it in God and I'll pour it out every one of us was as lost as lost could be and we were born between Satan and Eve that's what your Prophet said spoken words original SE oh my you see once we realize the aspect of God's forgiveness it makes it a lot easier for us to forgive others cuz we're not forgiving them on their Merit we're forgiving them as God forgave us now watch this in Matthew's 6:14 if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses brother Brandon when he reads this he said so we see faith is based upon forgiveness so you see whenever we hold something in our hearts against whoever it is and we think we're getting at them you're hurting yourself worse than you are them you'll never have to answer for what other people do I'll never have to answer for what other people do I'll answer for what I do right so can you imagine as we come back to it again if if you're sitting here tonight and you've had something in your heart and I'll never forgive I'll never I don't care whatever do I'll never do it you have cut off your own forgiveness from God it's like God has got it on hold and your sins are accumulating and accumulating and accumulating I'll tell you one thing I wouldn't want to live 10 minutes with an accumulation a day no way a week you kidding me a month no the way I look at it I have no other choice but to forgive my enemies pray for them that despitefully use me people that have told lies and oh oh my my heart has been tore out Carol tells me all the time I got scars on my hands here and scars on my arms there I've cut myself and done this and that and the other you know and I'll come in and my hand will be blessed Lord what have you done now what have you done Lord have mercy Donnie and she said every time I see one of them scars on your hands I think you're a poor heart your heart has been tore out of you you've got scars All Over You by people people that you Pastor and preacher friends and this and that and the other and we all do we bear those scars and we can pet those scars and baby them and magnify them and put them in a frame on a wall if that's what you want to do I'd rather just move on the way I look at scars them scars you you've heard me tell the story many many times whenever I got Fox bit when we were all little I've still got that scar there in my hand a rabid Fox and we had to take the shots for the rabies well to me when I look at that ham now that scar is numb it's been numb since I was about 11y old kid something like that but because there is a scar there is a sign that my body healed itself so that scar is there yep I looked down at it did today thought about that fox whenever it ran out of the woods and knocked my sister Kim down and got on top of her she had her hands over her face like this and it was nibbling on her arms and I had a pocket knife and I grabbed it out whenever I did that fox went straight from me and grabbed a hold of my hand funny how you have flashbacks like that but I'm glad that I had a scar instead of an open wound on that hand ain't you all would any of you want to shake hands with me if I had blood and I'm running down and whenever my daddy come and Mama and they got us in there and they took us up to the doctor and had to sew us up and all that sort of thing I'm glad I got stitched up I'm glad I got sewed up and I'm also glad that that scar is there because that signifies I can touch it or don't feel it but I know that I am healed well I think it's time that some of you give Jesus the needle and let him stitch up your spirit and Stitch up your imagination and Stitch up some of these things instead of you putting your scars on the wall and hanging them in a 48 by 98 picture for him and say look at my scar let him heal you tonight and let him open up the channel of forgiveness from your heart so your sins can be forgiven amen oh my let's get down to Colossians 312 Now watch how Paul again is going to call on us to do something put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bows of mercies kindness humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering now notice he isn't saying that the Holy Ghost is going to do it all you got to do is just stand around he Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam he'll just hit you with all and say glory to God I'm so humble and I'm so proud of it I am so Meek I've got the old P up no but Paul uses the word IND Duo so it's like putting on a garment or sinking into closing now we we can't make the Garment we can't buy the Garment we cannot provide the Garment God gives the Garment of humbleness of Mind God gives the Garment of all these wonderful things but we still have to put it on do you want it tonight put on in Duo as sinking into clothing as the elect of God so now we're talking about bride material yeah amen put on as the elect of God holy and beloved and that's what you are bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering let me read this to you humility is not thinking poorly of oneself but rather it is having the proper estimate of oneself self in the will of God not thinking too high it's amazing how much the New Testament mentions about this now meekness is not weakness it's power under control I love the contrast of the way that God does this because it's like God uses a power and he leaves that power in us after the Regeneration but the thing is that the Holy Ghost is not going to totally rip out everything of our humanity and then say blessed are they that overcome he just put you through the end of the P reach in there and grabs you and pulls you out on the other side you never overcome nothing but he's going to fill you with the Holy Ghost and leave that human makeup them flaws and them imperfections and then daily he's going to help you to overcome it and there'll be times you won't do so good and there'll be days you'll do better and then there'll be other days you'll sort of mediocre you know what I'm saying and many has him in your life sure you do if you're honest but yet the ultimate is that he wants you to reach that place of being a total Overcomer look at this when I was studying on this I found these examples I thought it was really amazing this word was used to describe a soothing wind a healing medicine and a cult that have been broken and each instance there is power a wind can become a storm too much medicine can kill a horse can break loose but this power is under control so we don't take all the force out of the wind but rather brings the wind under control so when you look at our lives as the children of God now look again that Paul says longsuffering the word is literally long tempero the short-tempered person speaks and acts impulsively ly and lack self-control when a person is longsuffering he can put up with provoking people or circumstances without retaliating amen thank you Jesus it's okay right now to say help me Lord praise the Lord now let's look again down here in at verse 13 again forbearing one another to forebear is not only freely to forgive but to meet halfway with extended hand now you see friend I realize that everybody in the world cannot and never will be able to fulfill this verse of scripture am as I said this not Revelation 10:7 it's not anything you know about the shout and the voice and the trumpet but these people who obtained this will be part of the shout the voice and the trumpet I love the meaning of this word to forbear is not only Frey to forgive but to meet halfway with extended hand but how many of us when somebody wrongs us we are not taking one step toward them it's their place to come to me and they need to get down on their belly and I mean they need a qual about a half a mile and they need to bring my favorite drink and my favorite Little Debbie cake and they need to bring me a a $100 gift card from from shop house and a $500 gift card from here and there and I might consider it you hypocrite you see only the elect of God can do this because they're the only ones with divine nature others will try their best there'll be many people that will read these scriptures and they'll hear it preach so maybe hope hopefully not some here tonight but there may be some and they say I need to do that I need to do it and they'll try and they'll try and they'll try and they'll fall and they'll try and they'll fall and they'll try and they'll fall and you will not be able to do it I'm telling you right now until divine nature is in you because he wants it to be him in us doing it not us for those of you that has listening to the statute of a perfect man Blasphemous names you're hearing the prophet saying there that these things some people have those things nature given so those some of those things people can just do by nature but God raises the level so high that human nature given faith will collapse human nature given virtue and knowledge and Temperance and godess and all these things will never reach it he's done it that way so it will only be his attributes that can reach the measure of the Statue of a perfect man oh my forbearing one another and forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any oh my goodness you you mean to tell me the New Testament Church The Acts 2 tongues talking devil casting out Miracle working Believers in that first century had quarrels in the church if they had any human beings that did If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you and Word of Life said even as so you see he didn't say Paul didn't say now as I have forgiven and as Peter did as oh no that's not the example I am not your example when it comes to this Jesus is I want to be a god example before you you understand that even as Christ forgave you so how does he forgive us God's forgiveness is complete and final it is not conditional or partial wow amen he's still working on me and you he's still working on me and you in reality friends could we serve the Lord Jesus if he held back just one t of our sins and said I I'll forgive you 90% but this this 10 % and I I'm going to have an attitude toward you so whenever you come to pray I I'm just going to I mean I'm I'm going to you know just kind of turn my head at times because that 10% just it's really bugging me it's just really bothering me so you know there may be certain days that you come to pray that I'll just say h I'm not going to hear this prayer today she's really bothering me with that temperament but he so forgives us it's so complete don't you understand we cannot do this and I am so glad it eradicates our ability to do it Carol it eradicates our ability we can't do it there only he can't forgive this we praise God so he forgave us for Christ's sake now watch Colossians 3:14 and above all these things put on charity now watch so here Paul is writing to Saints of course with the Holy Ghost some Believers that no doubt didn't have the Holy Ghost but again he's identifying this charity as it were a garment so what was it moving in to the fullness of what God wanted them to be and believe it or not it was not just Supernatural it was not just shouting Miracles healing we believe in all that but you'll never find God's Prophet when you preaches the statute of a perfect man ever using that as a sign of you being Bride As a matter of fact you'll find the opposite and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness I want to share this word with you I thought it might mean a little more to you if you'd be able to hear it the bond of perfectness was an upper garment which completes and keeps the get together the rest so can't you see when God adds faith and virtue and knowledge and Temperance and so on and so on and then when this ch ity which is the top of the Cal when it comes in the attribute of its fullness you see the church ages will receive the fullness of what is needed for a resurrection but yet Luther had a portion of the spirit of God Wesley had a portion of the spirit of God Pentecost had a portion of the spirit of God when I gave my heart to the Lord and I received the Holy Ghost I believe I got the Holy Ghost I received a portion of the spirit of God but I did not have it in my soul come on when Carol and I started embracing the message and Carol read the token and when she started reading that she got under such conviction and she told me Donnie I don't have what he's saying here because Carol had cut her hair in Pentecost and she said there's no way that I have gone what he what he said so she stayed up most of that night just about all night long crying and praying before the Lord so to me one of the mistakes that many of the people has come out of Pentecost into the message have made is this they changed their Doctrine but they never allowed their experience to move from their Spirit into their soul and that's why they're never a able to fully embrace the teachings of the message and they will nine times out of 10 they'll tend to go right back toward the teaching of Pentecost on this friends I don't understand I do not understand we've got Brothers in our message that are teaching the gifts the same way that I believed them over 40 years ago when I was a Pentecostal preacher teaching it exactly the same way that I believed it when I was a Pentecostal and somehow believing that God's Prophet was wrong in the way that he taught it I don't understand it I scratched my head and think how in the world can this be that's what I believed 40 years ago why in the world when I want to go back to that what I believes in when God sent us a prophet to correct all that for us praise the Lord oh my so here charity is the top garment ah notice in 1 John 4:12 no man has seen God at any time and if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us so it carried out to completion that is our love for each other is the reflection of his love reigning in our hearts this is what gives us the ability to love one another in spite of our quarrels in spite of our dislikes for this and that and the other oh listen to Blasphemous names and you hear the prophet saying something like this he's he's interpreting sister Shepherd's dream and sister Shepherd had a dream about a year prior to the preaching of the Statue of a perfect man and she's up on top of this mountain and there was a rock box and out of this rock box was coming forth pure streams of water and as it came down through down off of this mountain it was coming down through there nothing could stop it nothing could contain it and this man which he said was the messenger to the church which I thought was pretty phenomenal because he said he was quite a large man and work clothes and he was the messenger to the church bringing the message so he wasn't measuring brother brenham's human stature but his position according in to the age so believe it or not all the rest of us are little guys yeah amen so out of the rock box and this messenger told her in the Dream It's the Holy Spirit nothing can contain it it's too great but then something started coming out of the rock box and it was honey and as the honey started pouring from the top of the mountain Oh Glory to God and was coming down the mountain and you know how honey is it's sticky so he said as the honey come down it started sticking it together now he said I'm a I'm an old man and I once was young and now I'm old and he said I've seen it and he said say people say well I don't like brother Neville and I sure don't like this brother but he said let something happened to them and it about breaks your heart and he said if they was to leave or something like that and you say oh Lord oh Lord I I'm so sorry I never got to make peace with my brother he said see that brotherly kindness will stick now notice the attribute right before our age is kept off is what brotherly kindness wonder why wonder why never remember almighty God arranged these things in the order that he wanted he knew exactly what he was doing and yet he put brotherly kindness right at the very top right before the Capstone comes and caps us off adoption and also adopts the entire temple of God remember the seven Church Ages was a pyramid form and the Capstone capping off this age produces the resur rection power which will raise all seven Church ages they are waiting on us children don't think it's just me today and old brother Donnie's putting us under so much huh me it ain't me that's putting you under this if Paul was here tonight he'd be screaming out come on Word of Life if Peter was here and say come on Word of Life you need to move up you need to climb higher there's more there's more all those ages all those Millions of saints are waiting for the brotherly kindness to boil out of the rock now the prophet picked up Sister Shepherd's dream that she wrote to him in a letter and he said as soon as he started reading it he saw a vision and the vision interpreted the dream that's the way real dreams are interpreted by a prophet of God that's right and Word of Life said so he said in so much that she saw the rock box and he said that rock box was re ration of the word the rock of Revelation and the water it gust down into five streams which was Grace and he said that water was the Holy Ghost and he said now remember this sister was praying whether she had the holy ghost or not oh children think of where God is calling us now when he preached the statue of a perfect man and he draws it out on a chalkboard and he points with his finger and he said now God did not chir of this age what this age had and this one and this one but it just so happens we are right at the top so what's God requiring of us all of them you can't pick the one or two or three that you're good at but God is demanding them all yes sir stand together oh Jesus Colossians 3:15 Paul says let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also ye are called in one body and be ye thankful aren't you thankful tonight for the mercy of God Amen brother Donnie that that's so discourages me because there ain't no way in the world I can do that don't be discouraged that's I told you thank God you can't do it I can't do it brother brandom couldn't do it if you've not listened to these if you do listen to it notice how brother brandham is self- inclusive and how he includes himself us and me and us and we cuz he was looking at himself and wanting to climb higher and higher and higher and he said there was a little flange right on the top and remember that Capstone is a mini pyramid itself and it comes right down and sits right down on the very top and he called it the seal he called it your adoption called it several things cuz it all consummates in you reaching your place then the spirit of God I love the way he deals with it even in ordination of a minister which was the night when he preached that day of statue of a perfect man just a few words there but I found in listening to him that sometimes some Services I have wordss he'll mention just a few key words and then I catch those keys and then I go back in retrospect and listen to it again and sometimes for me it just makes it so much clearer but he's talking about one leads to the other to the other to the other we'll look at it Lord willing Sunday even the word add don't mean what you think it is add to your faith virtue add to your virture knowledge it don't mean like a calculator so one will run right out into the other to the other and it makes a way for the other praise God and once we have arrived until those virtues that they're manifested in us then it's unfolding of God inside of us till he gets every member of the body I hope y'all are still praying for God to bring every name in off the Lamb's Book of Life and bring them in in a hurry cuz I'm ready to go ain't you I'm ready to leave this place y'all want to stay here you can have it I'm ready to leave this place but you realize they can't go until these are molded in shaped in them won't it be awesome to see some of the last ones that come in those of us that have been sitting around for years and years and with our eyes we'll be able to see people come in it will be like a rocket the spirit of God will move on them and they'll see this and catch that and catch that oh my it'll be phenomenal to see what God is doing through praise God praise God well I'll tell you what it'll do it'll Revitalize us sir yes it will let's bow our heads together oh praise the Lord how may like to be remembered tonight anybody beside me say Lord I need help with all this I'm sure that many of you can see portions of this in your life but you see that's not what God wants to see or what we want to see we don't want to just see portions we want to see it in the full fruition of what God intends for it to be so it can lead to the other and the other and then God will finish his bride this is our part in the temple of God praise the Lord heavenly father as we bow our heads to the dust of the earth we want to thank you first of all for your word tonight we thank you Lord Lord for we made a little trip to the doctor's office we knew he was coming to church but we didn't know he was going to the doctor's office for a checkup so we stepped up on the scales and told us how much we weighed then they measured our height told us we was that checked our blood done our blood pressure done this and that and the other and the doctor come in the room Dr Jesus and he took our chart and said said I see your sugar's a little high well in your terminology you'd say I'd see your forgiveness is a little bit low I'd say your Temperance is running a little bit low here I I'm going to I'm going to help you raise that Temperance but you and I'll have to do it together you're going to have to ask me to and you're going to have to want me to with all of your heart and then I'll set it in motion because you and I are a team some of you are wondering what your part is it's quite simple really you see your need and then you begin to ask him can we ask him right here tonight Lord help me these verses are bride identification verses Lord Jesus what good would it do us to come come here to look the part on the outside and yet Lord miss having these as part of our inheritance we all can be honest because you know our hearts anyway Lord some of these things are very hard they are because there's something about us as human beings we can tend to be vindictive and we can be very harsh and hard on others we all want mercy of course for ourselves but we can sure be hard on anybody else that trespasses against us I'm just so grateful you're not like me I'm grateful you're not like some of the people that we know around the message and maybe even some that we go to church with they have so little Grace so little mercy and it's evident they have never really caught a true picture of how lost they were because if they ever do then forgiveness will take on a complete new meaning then they will be able to forgive for Christ's sake thank you Lord Jesus oh God we worship you tonight father we worship you Lord Jesus oh gentle dove of God if there's anyone here tonight that has grieved you my father May the spirit of God with that gentleness just come down and just Smite our hearts with a stroke of love and mercy so we can see Lord that we need more of you oh it's it's it's just the way it's got to be I need more of you Lord hard I can't go on without having more of you in my life and it's not that you are measured by a volume of a spoon or a quart bottle or a gallon jug but the way I can tell that I'm getting more of you which when your attributes are taking more control of me not when things are going good but when they're going bad and I don't need to tell them that as we attain Victory after victory in these attributes you will allow us to be Tried by the very things that we have attained to you do it for multiple reasons so you can show us that we're changing and so you can show the devil because you've done been bragging about us to the devil and youve done been telling him you've got a bride that ain't going to Bow no matter what you've got a bride ain't like Eve you've got a bride that's going to walk with this word oh you've been telling him a lot of stuff about us he sends his demons down here and they try everything they can do to revoke your testimony about us but you've done said it about us there ain't enough devils in Hell there ain't enough sickness and we ain't rotten enough and sorry enough to stop that testimony of yours from being fulfill you've spoke it and it will come to pass amen so has it been written so let it be done amen we worship you tonight father oh hallelujah hallelujah can you just raise your hands time him now and say Lord I need more I need more of you Lord more of your love

I've been checking my brother Jason just about every day sometimes a couple times during the day and she really needs a touch from the Lord as far as what the doctors are saying of course they're giving her no hope and maybe just a few days to a week or something like that but we believe God's will will be done in the life of a son or daughter of God you believe that we may not understand the way they go we may don't understand all of that but before we go tonight I'd like for us to pray for her is there anyone here that would have a special need on your heart you just like to signify by
