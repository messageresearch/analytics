[10:37] you it's my first chance getting to see
[10:39] this me and my family weren't able to
[10:41] make the meetings that you had the
[10:42] dedication but
[10:44] you know when God told Abraham he would
[10:46] bless him he said he would bless all the
[10:48] nations of the earth and I believe when
[10:50] when God blesses the bride the whole
[10:53] bride is blessed
[10:55] so I want to tell you you're an
[10:56] encouragement amen this church is an
[10:58] encouragement we stream you we love your
[11:00] amen love the preaching for many years
[11:02] the singing the music my goodness and
[11:05] what a facility it's the place the Lord
[11:07] has given you brother Michael gave us
[11:08] the grand tour last night
[11:10] and I think you thought of everything
[11:11] but Louie I mean you thought of
[11:13] everything I was there one of my
[11:16] favorite Parts was that he showed me the
[11:17] Deacon's office and it was designed so
[11:20] perfectly that right beside the Deacon's
[11:22] office is the Infirmary
[11:24] huh
[11:26] many are the afflictions of the
[11:28] righteous the Bible says amen so we were
[11:31] just uh we're disprivileged Amen to be
[11:33] here and bring greetings from my dad and
[11:35] at home I was so blessed amen got to
[11:38] take part last night my brother Josh did
[11:40] such an outstanding job how many young
[11:42] people were blessed by the word that was
[11:44] spoken last night why don't we give the
[11:46] Lord Jesus a hand clap of Praise amen
[11:49] for what God's doing
[11:51] Hallelujah
[11:55] amen what he's doing in the lives of our
[11:57] young people amen there's nothing the
[11:58] Bible says No Greater Joy that I have
[12:00] than my children walk in truth you know
[12:03] Sister Hattie was given that opportunity
[12:04] just hearing it the other day on tape
[12:06] I've heard but now I see and brother
[12:08] Brandon said there in that room he was
[12:10] given the testimony about the squirrels
[12:12] and he said you know brother he said I
[12:14] don't know what what it could have been
[12:15] other than Jehovah Jireh and sister
[12:18] Hattie spoke those words that's nothing
[12:20] but the truth isn't it amazing just the
[12:22] agreement
[12:24] just believing and saying Amen to the
[12:26] word of God what that unlocks for a
[12:29] Believer from Heaven prophet of God said
[12:31] when she spoke those words it felt like
[12:33] the room was about to come apart my
[12:35] goodness and you don't think it's
[12:36] important if we say Amen to the word of
[12:38] God Amen and we support the preaching of
[12:41] the word brother Branham said Hattie you
[12:43] ask anything right now and God will give
[12:45] it to you that's thus saith the Lord
[12:47] their sister Edith he said sit in a
[12:50] wheelchair crippled he said we've been
[12:52] praying for her he said she could have
[12:53] asked for her sister imagine that could
[12:56] have asked for anything at that moment
[12:58] there's her mom and dad he said you know
[13:00] sick and she'd had to take care of them
[13:02] and he said she could have asked for a
[13:04] million dollars right there just to help
[13:05] her and to support her but I thought it
[13:08] was so amazing to identify the True
[13:10] Heart of a parent more than anything she
[13:12] said brother Brandon more than anything
[13:14] in this life I want the salvation of my
[13:17] two boys
[13:18] and I thought boy how many could
[13:20] identify with that to say Lord if you
[13:22] could do anything do it for my children
[13:24] I mean I believe God's doing something
[13:26] so special so we just bring you
[13:28] greetings and encouragement amen how
[13:30] many would have a need upon your heart
[13:32] maybe you'd bow your head with me raise
[13:34] your hand they can play something just
[13:36] softly just raise that hand up to the
[13:38] Lord and just say Lord here's my need
[13:39] this morning same God who spoke to
[13:41] Hattie Wright can come and speak to me
[13:43] amen this morning Lord Jesus we approach
[13:47] your throne of Mercy Lord father we've
[13:50] read these needs
[13:51] Lord these great requests Lord of
[13:53] sickness and afflictions and diseases
[13:56] and problems and issues Lord behind each
[13:59] hand this morning I've got mine raised
[14:01] Lord behind each hands a need that's
[14:03] represented Lord but I can hear the word
[14:06] you spoke to Abraham as anything too
[14:08] hard for the Lord Lord nothing's too
[14:11] great for you and these are human issues
[14:14] Lord these are part of this Fallen flesh
[14:16] that we live in part of the curse of sin
[14:20] Lord but there's something inside of us
[14:22] that longs down on the inside for this
[14:24] Mortal to put on immortality for that
[14:26] day when this corruptable will put on
[14:28] incorruption Lord we long for that day
[14:31] Lord but even now we believe that those
[14:33] benefits from that Eternal realm can
[14:35] pass down from that Dimension down into
[14:38] this Dimension I pray God you would just
[14:40] come and visit us Lord in a special way
[14:42] may the word go forth with power Lord
[14:45] and may it change lives Lord may we
[14:47] reach out and take a hold of the promise
[14:49] of God lord as it's minister to us I
[14:52] raise my hand and say Lord this morning
[14:54] with all of these people I raise my hand
[14:56] and say Don't Pass Me By Lord Jesus may
[14:59] you come and speak to your children we
[15:01] ask for all these needs we give you the
[15:03] honor and the glory in the name of Jesus

[40:03] you've given us Lord and Lord when we
[40:06] can come together each one of us a
[40:08] Believer and Lord knowing that we all
[40:11] have a lick of fire off that great
[40:12] Pillar of Fire and Lord when we come
[40:15] together like this Lord your Prophet
[40:18] said the pillar of fire is back in our
[40:19] midst again and Lord we believe that to
[40:22] be true and Lord I pray that this

[40:44] power in it and Lord when that word
[40:46] begins to go forth Lord I I don't have a

[40:51] got supreme confidence in your word and
[40:54] Lord I know that your word can never
[40:56] fail it can never pass away Lord because
[40:59] you said Heaven and Earth will pass away
[41:01] but my word will never fail and Lord I
[41:04] believe that this morning that word
[41:05] cannot return unto you void but it has
[41:07] to accomplish the thing that you sent it
[41:10] to do so God I pray Lord that the word
[41:12] would strike the mark this morning Lord
[41:15] that it would just drop down into a
[41:17] believing heart and Lord when we leave
[41:19] here today we will leave with a
[41:20] testimony and we would begin to say did
[41:23] not our hearts burn within us as you
[41:25] spoke with us along the way Lord grant
[41:27] it this morning as we commit this
[41:29] service into your hands we give
[41:30] ourselves to you now for your glory in
[41:33] the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[41:36] and amen amen God bless you if you take
[41:39] your Bibles this morning I want to
[41:40] invite you to turn with me to the book
[41:42] of Galatians in the first chapter of
[41:44] Galatians I want to read a few verses
[41:48] there and then I also want to read from
[41:50] the book of Jude just one verse of
[41:52] scripture also in the book of Jude but
[41:54] we'll start in Galatians 1
[41:56] and I'd like to read from the first
[41:58] verse
[42:03] Paul an apostle
[42:05] not of men neither by man but by Jesus
[42:09] Christ and God the Father who raised him
[42:13] from the dead
[42:15] and all the Brethren which are with me
[42:17] into the church of galatia Grace be to
[42:20] you and peace from God the father and
[42:22] from our Lord Jesus Christ
[42:24] who gave himself for our sins that he
[42:26] might Deliver Us from this present evil
[42:29] world according to the will of God and
[42:32] our father to whom be glory forever and
[42:36] ever amen I Marvel that yeast are so
[42:40] soon removed from him that called you
[42:42] unto the grace or into the grace of
[42:44] Christ unto another gospel
[42:47] which is not another
[42:50] but there be some that trouble you and
[42:53] would pervert the gospel of Christ but
[42:56] though we are an angel from heaven
[42:58] preach any other gospel unto you than
[43:02] that which we have preached unto you let
[43:05] him be a curse
[43:07] and as we have said before so say I now
[43:11] again if any man preach any other gospel
[43:15] unto you then that which you have
[43:17] received let him be a curse
[43:22] the book of Jude we'll just read one
[43:24] verse there the third verse
[43:28] the Bible says beloved
[43:31] when I gave all diligence to right unto
[43:33] you of the common salvation
[43:36] it was needful for me to write unto you
[43:38] and exhort you that you should earnestly
[43:40] contend for the faith that was once
[43:44] delivered unto the Saints amen may God
[43:47] add His blessings as you're seated this
[43:48] morning
[43:56] I'd like to just speak for a few minutes
[43:59] this morning on
[44:00] contending for the faith
[44:02] and you know I believe that as the Bible
[44:05] says here that
[44:07] Jude is encouraging us to earnestly
[44:10] contend for the faith and you know the
[44:13] faith that he's talking about he said he
[44:15] identifies that Faith as the faith that
[44:18] was once delivered unto the Saints now I
[44:21] just believe this morning there really
[44:22] ain't but one Faith amen how many
[44:25] believes that's the truth because
[44:26] they're in Ephesians 4 Paul begins to
[44:29] say that there's one body and one Spirit
[44:31] even as you're called in one hope of
[44:33] your calling one Lord One Faith one
[44:36] baptism one God and Father of us all who
[44:40] is above all and through all and in you
[44:42] all and so really there's only one Faith
[44:45] this morning and that's the faith of the
[44:48] Lord Jesus Christ now amen he would tell
[44:50] us to earnestly contend for the faith
[44:52] now brother Brandon would would preach
[44:55] uh and use this for a text and the
[44:58] message earnestly contending for the
[44:59] faith he said now let's just stop here a
[45:01] few moments and he said earnestly
[45:04] contending for the faith now what is it
[45:06] to contend to contend is to debate or
[45:10] stand there and hold fast on your
[45:12] conviction amen for what earnestly
[45:14] contend for the faith not a faith but
[45:17] the faith amen now somebody says well
[45:20] now brother Branham that's not my faith
[45:22] I don't believe in that he said but see
[45:23] there's only one Faith One Faith one
[45:26] Lord one baptism and that's the faith of
[45:28] the Lord Jesus Christ see only one Faith
[45:30] now we got a lot of religions and we got
[45:33] a lot of Ceremonies and amen but there's
[45:35] only one faith that we should earnestly
[45:37] contend for and that's the faith that
[45:40] was once delivered to the Saints amen
[45:42] can we say Amen to that this morning
[45:44] listen there's all kind of ideas and
[45:46] there's all kind of doctrines there's
[45:47] all kind of religions in the world today
[45:49] but there's really only one faith and
[45:52] and there's only one gospel amen as Paul
[45:54] would say here in Galatians as he's amen
[45:57] speaking to that church he says amen I I
[45:59] Marvel at how soon you have been removed
[46:02] from the gospel to another gospel and he
[46:05] said which there is not another amen
[46:07] listen friends there ain't no other
[46:08] gospel amen there's only one gospel and
[46:11] I just want to start by saying this amen
[46:13] it is a devil that comes along and tries
[46:15] to separate this message even from the
[46:18] Bible amen that ain't nothing but a
[46:20] lying devil amen because the message
[46:22] that we believe is not something
[46:23] separate from the from the scripture
[46:25] amen the message that you believe is the
[46:28] same message that Paul believed it's the
[46:30] same message that Peter believed amen
[46:33] listen friends amen William Branham did
[46:35] not come to preach to us another gospel
[46:37] amen amen this is not another gospel
[46:40] amen this is the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[46:44] do you believe that's the truth amen
[46:46] there ain't but one gospel and Paul amen
[46:49] said amen and even if an angel come from
[46:51] heaven and we preach any other gospel
[46:54] than that which we have preached amen
[46:56] then you let him be a curse now amen and
[46:58] looking at this this morning amen amen
[47:00] to earnestly contend it means to be be
[47:03] sincere and intense with a conviction
[47:05] amen that you got to as seriously amen
[47:09] approach this thing you got to be
[47:10] sincere in your heart now amen I just
[47:13] want to say this if you've got to
[47:14] contend for the faith amen it's showing
[47:16] you right there already amen that this
[47:18] is going to be a battle
[47:20] amen you're gonna have to fight you're
[47:22] gonna have to amen you're gonna have to
[47:23] take a stand listen friends amen we
[47:25] don't need a bunch of jellyfish amen uh
[47:28] Christians amen with a wishbone instead
[47:30] of a backbone what we need is some real
[47:33] Born Again Holy Ghost Field Believers
[47:35] amen that are willing to take a stand
[47:37] amen I tell you what and I just tell you
[47:40] what the prophet of God said he said any
[47:42] man that's ever amounted to anything
[47:43] amen had to stand on his own convictions
[47:46] amen and he had to stand alone he had to
[47:49] stand amen listen when there's nobody
[47:51] else to stand amen you got to stand if
[47:54] you're only one in your family even that
[47:57] believes the word of God you've got to
[47:59] stand there on your conviction amen and
[48:03] earnestly contend for the faith
[48:06] is that right listen friend sometimes
[48:09] will walk with God Amen it's a lonely
[48:11] walk amen and to walk with God you've
[48:13] got to walk alone amen but I I like what
[48:16] the Bible says over there in John 16.
[48:18] amen Jesus is telling his disciples he's
[48:20] he's getting them ready for his
[48:22] departure amen and he's telling them he
[48:24] said listen you're going to be scattered
[48:26] and you're going to leave me and I'll be
[48:28] left alone he said but yet not alone for
[48:31] the father will be with me and I want to
[48:33] tell you this and just encourage you
[48:34] amen sometimes you feel like you're all
[48:36] by yourself amen sometimes you get a
[48:39] feeling like Elijah had one day amen
[48:41] when he stood against Jezebel that
[48:43] Jezebel religion and he stood out there
[48:45] and he thought I'm the only one left in
[48:47] all of Israel amen I'm the only one amen
[48:50] they've torn down the altars amen they
[48:52] they are rejected amen amen the god the
[48:55] Jehovah God and I'm left alone amen but
[48:58] God Amen opened up the seals the prophet
[49:00] said amen and he showed him amen no I
[49:03] got seven thousand Hallelujah that's
[49:05] never bowed and amen and he showed that
[49:08] prophet of God you ain't by yourself
[49:09] amen and let me just say this amen you
[49:12] ain't by yourself either
[49:14] hallelujah amen and the biggest saying
[49:17] amen now we got to realize is that if
[49:19] God before us then who can be against us
[49:27] Hallelujah Amen to earnestly to
[49:31] sincerely intensely amen with a
[49:34] conviction I tell you friends we got to
[49:36] have a conviction and stand on our
[49:38] conviction the prophet said amen the
[49:40] first one to introduce the message of
[49:42] our faith would be our lord Jesus he
[49:44] said Jesus was a product of what God
[49:47] intended for us to contend for amen the
[49:50] whole Christian faith laid in Jesus
[49:52] Christ our faith in him now if we can
[49:54] only understand what kind of Faith he
[49:56] taught what kind of Faith he practiced
[49:59] and then we could see by that amen if
[50:01] the early church practiced the same
[50:03] thing then we should earnestly contend
[50:06] for that type of Faith see for his
[50:09] commission for us to continue in that
[50:12] Faith amen now so it's very powerful to
[50:15] think about this amen the prophet is
[50:17] showing us that the faith that we are
[50:19] contending for amen Jesus is the faith
[50:23] of Jesus Christ and he showed us by
[50:26] example amen amen and I just say what
[50:28] kind of faith that he had even he had
[50:31] perfect faith amen he had Faith amen the
[50:34] prophet said he walked in a world to
[50:37] himself amen he walked unconscious of
[50:41] criticisms amen because he had faith and
[50:44] listen I think it's amazing amen what
[50:46] the prophet of God showed us he said
[50:48] what gave Jesus such great faith amen
[50:51] listen for his it was not some
[50:53] Supernatural amen a feeling that he had
[50:56] that gave him the faith amen but what
[50:58] gave him the faith according to the
[50:59] prophet as he is that he identified
[51:02] himself in the scripture he saw himself
[51:06] in the word amen and when he saw himself
[51:09] in the word it give him the faith amen
[51:12] oh listen friends I'll tell you
[51:13] something else about the faith that was
[51:15] in him even because the faith that was
[51:17] in Jesus was the faith of God Amen and
[51:20] the faith that was that God had it's God
[51:22] spoke the word and brother Brown said he
[51:25] believed his own word
[51:28] then his word became material
[51:32] oh Hallelujah I'm telling you this
[51:35] morning friends that's the kind of faith
[51:36] that ought to be in the Church of the
[51:38] Living God he said brother what are you
[51:40] saying I'm saying we ought to speak
[51:42] God's word and we ought to believe God's
[51:44] word and then watch amen the word of God
[51:48] when it comes out of your mouth become
[51:50] material
[51:52] because the word of God has never failed
[51:55] in the mouth of God's believing children
[52:00] do you believe that
[52:01] [Applause]
[52:06] amen
[52:07] Jesus told his disciples one day
[52:10] have faith in God
[52:12] you know but
[52:13] the prophet comes on and says listen
[52:16] he said he begins to show us the
[52:18] translation it should be have the faith
[52:21] of God
[52:23] listen amen amen and then we find out
[52:26] amen Paul says and later on he says he
[52:29] says the life that I now live I live by
[52:32] the faith
[52:34] by the faith amen of the Son of God
[52:37] listen rizz and and brother Brown picks
[52:40] it up in the church age book there
[52:41] brother Matt and he shows it was not his
[52:43] faith in God Amen that that he was
[52:47] living by that was giving him overcoming
[52:49] power it was the faith of God in him
[52:55] Hallelujah listens a lot of people say
[52:58] they believe in God there's a lot of
[53:00] people amen that that perhaps amen have
[53:03] a belief amen but I tell you what amen
[53:06] there's a group of people on the Earth
[53:07] this morning amen that not only has
[53:09] faith in God but they have the faith of
[53:13] God in them
[53:15] hallelujah amen and the light that we
[53:17] now live we live by the faith of the Son
[53:20] of God that's in US listen that's why
[53:22] you're an overcomer
[53:25] it's not because amen of you as an
[53:29] individual I just want to say this is a
[53:31] you ain't no match for the devil within
[53:33] yourself
[53:34] amen you are no match for him amen but
[53:38] if you got this Revelation and you've
[53:40] been born again filled with the Holy
[53:42] Ghost amen then you uh amen you can say
[53:45] this is what greater it's he that is in
[53:47] me
[53:49] than he that's in the world you know why
[53:51] you're an overcomer amen because the
[53:53] Overcomer is in you and Jesus said I
[53:57] have overcome them Hallelujah he's
[54:00] already overcome and now the Overcomer
[54:04] is in you
[54:05] it's his faith in you oh my how many
[54:09] he's thankful for the faith
[54:12] amen
[54:13] now
[54:14] Galatians 2 20 he said I'm crucified
[54:17] with Christ nevertheless I live not I
[54:20] but Christ that lives in me is that
[54:21] right amen so listen the faith that
[54:24] we're contending for it's not a Baptist
[54:26] faith
[54:27] no disrespect to them it's not a
[54:29] Methodist Faith it's not a Pentecostal
[54:32] Faith it's not a amen Church of God
[54:33] faith it's the faith
[54:36] Hallelujah the faith of Jesus Christ the
[54:40] faith that was once delivered to the
[54:42] Saints now in the church age book amen
[54:44] the prophet says we know exactly from
[54:47] the word which was recorded by the Holy
[54:49] Spirit how the first or original church
[54:51] was founded and how that God manifested
[54:53] himself in her the word can't change or
[54:57] be changed because the word is God
[55:00] Hallelujah John 1 and 1 in the beginning
[55:03] what's the word
[55:05] is that right Amen in the beginning was
[55:08] the word I just want to amen stop right
[55:10] here and say something Amen in the
[55:12] beginning was the word the word was the
[55:15] beginning
[55:16] listen because before the word came out
[55:19] of God nothing had started
[55:22] amen the first thing that happened in
[55:24] all creation Amen brother bam would show
[55:26] us the picture he said to logos amen the
[55:29] word amen come out of God Amen and and
[55:32] the Bible says that the worlds were
[55:35] framed by the word of God Amen so the
[55:38] word was the beginning let me just say
[55:41] this it's still the beginning
[55:44] amen if something's going to start it's
[55:46] got to start with the word
[55:48] if there's going to be a Revival and
[55:50] it's going to be a real Revival it's
[55:52] going to have to start with the word
[55:55] if somebody's going to get healed it's
[55:57] going to have to start with the word
[56:00] it's somebody's going to be saved it's
[56:02] going to start with the word
[56:04] if your life is ever going to be changed
[56:07] it's going to start with the word
[56:11] oh hallelujah amen in the beginning was
[56:15] the word and the Word was with God and
[56:17] the Word was God
[56:20] listen that's why you can't come along
[56:22] and say well I love Jesus but you but
[56:25] you don't love his word
[56:28] that's a Jesus of your imagination
[56:31] amen amen there's a lot of people that
[56:34] fell in love with amen they fell in love
[56:36] with Jesus amen but they fell in love
[56:38] with the story
[56:41] amen they fell in love amen with
[56:43] something that they imagined to be amen
[56:46] are not a reality because I tell you
[56:48] this amen you cannot separate God from
[56:50] his word
[56:51] and if you love God you'll love his word
[56:54] and if you love the word you love him
[56:57] let me go a little bit further with that
[56:58] and just tell you to receive the word is
[57:01] to receive Jesus Christ to reject the
[57:04] word is to reject Jesus Christ
[57:07] how many believe that's the truth
[57:09] listen you're living in a layout of cnh
[57:12] when Christ had been put out of the
[57:14] church
[57:15] but I want to tell you ain't nobody none
[57:16] of them churches out there amen Jesus
[57:19] wasn't standing in there with nail
[57:20] scarred hands and they said now wait a
[57:22] minute buddy welcome here and let him
[57:24] out the door
[57:25] no how did they put him out they put him
[57:28] out by putting his word out
[57:30] they rejected the word and therefore
[57:33] they rejected Christ listen I'll just
[57:35] say this without apology this morning
[57:37] amen because there's a lot of people
[57:39] even just looked at this message amen
[57:42] struck their shoulders and walked away
[57:43] amen and they thought they were walking
[57:45] away from an idea they thought they were
[57:48] walking away amen from William Bradham
[57:50] they thought they were walking away amen
[57:52] from just a a church or amen but listen
[57:55] amen when they looked at this Amen to
[57:58] listen and they walked away they were
[58:00] walking away from Jesus Christ
[58:05] Hallelujah I know the devil don't like
[58:07] it but I'm just gonna say it this
[58:09] morning this message is Christ
[58:15] listen I don't know I don't care what
[58:18] they made out of it and I can't help
[58:20] what other people have done with it amen
[58:22] but the message I believe it's not a
[58:25] bunch of doctrines it's not even an idea
[58:29] it's not just a better way to live it's
[58:32] not the thoughts of a Kentucky boy it's
[58:34] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[58:37] and forever
[58:43] Hallelujah
[58:46] it's a reality
[58:51] of a living God
[58:53] yes sir
[58:55] now watch
[58:57] we can see this as a prophet begins to
[59:01] say here he said
[59:03] he said to change one word of it
[59:06] as Eve did bring sin and death
[59:09] is that the truth
[59:11] as it says in Revelations 22 18 If any
[59:13] man shall add unto these things God
[59:16] shall add unto him the plagues that are
[59:18] written in this book
[59:20] Amen to us try them they say they're
[59:22] Apostles and are not and it's found them
[59:24] to be Liars
[59:26] amen and brother Brown said ain't that a
[59:28] blunt statement
[59:29] now it's tried them that cause and call
[59:32] themselves Apostles isn't that a blunt
[59:35] statement what right as a people to try
[59:37] those that call themselves Apostles and
[59:40] how do they try them well I love this
[59:42] here it is Galatians 1 and 8 but though
[59:44] we are an angel from heaven preach any
[59:46] other gospel unto you than that which we
[59:49] have already preached unto you let him
[59:51] be a curse it was the Apostle who
[59:53] brought the original word to the people
[59:55] and that original word could not change
[59:57] not even a daughter dash of it Paul knew
[1:00:00] it was God who spoke to him and said
[1:00:02] even if I come and try to give a second
[1:00:04] Revelation or try to make one little
[1:00:06] change in what I've give originally let
[1:00:09] me be a curse see Paul knew that the
[1:00:11] first revelation was correct and God
[1:00:14] can't give a first revelation and then a
[1:00:17] second Revelation if he did he would be
[1:00:20] changing his mind if he gave a
[1:00:22] revelation and then now listen brother
[1:00:24] Ed said he can give a revelation and
[1:00:26] then add to it
[1:00:30] now you got to catch that right there
[1:00:32] because amen amen how many believes that
[1:00:35] the message that that we have received
[1:00:37] is the very thing that Paul preached
[1:00:40] [Applause]
[1:00:42] amen because brother Brown when he went
[1:00:45] beyond the curtain of time amen and and
[1:00:47] he asked he said amen he said well Paul
[1:00:50] had to stand with his group he said yes
[1:00:53] Amen brother Brandon rejoiced in that
[1:00:55] fact you know why because he said
[1:00:58] because I preached what Paul preached
[1:01:01] [Music]
[1:01:02] [Applause]
[1:01:04] Hallelujah and y'all probably gonna
[1:01:06] think I'm crazy but I just tell you if I
[1:01:08] am Leave Me This Way unlike the prophet
[1:01:10] I feel good amen being how I am amen but
[1:01:13] I believe even that I was one of them
[1:01:16] voices that he heard that screamed out
[1:01:19] I'm resting on that
[1:01:22] Hallelujah you say brother what are you
[1:01:24] talking about you believe he was over
[1:01:26] there when the prophet I believe I got a
[1:01:28] theophany Hallelujah I believe I got a
[1:01:31] word body I believe it's already there
[1:01:34] if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved
[1:01:37] I have another
[1:01:39] Eternal in the heavens
[1:01:42] Hallelujah you say brother amen what are
[1:01:45] you talking about you believe you got a
[1:01:47] theophany you better believe it brother
[1:01:48] and I don't heard from it
[1:01:52] amen cause my brother said when you
[1:01:54] recognize this message to be Eagle food
[1:01:57] you let the other thing you've heard
[1:02:00] from your theophany
[1:02:05] Hallelujah
[1:02:07] listen if I get off on the deep end
[1:02:09] don't worry brother Donnie you'll
[1:02:10] straighten it out amen but I tell you
[1:02:12] what I believe I heard from it then and
[1:02:15] I believe if you can handle it right now
[1:02:16] I'm hearing from it right now this
[1:02:18] morning
[1:02:20] and I want to tell you the theophany
[1:02:21] that I got ain't A Million Miles Away I
[1:02:24] believe it's so close it's right in this
[1:02:26] room right now I'm feeling the influence
[1:02:28] of it right now Hallelujah and I'll be
[1:02:31] one of these mornings and it won't be
[1:02:33] long I'm going to take a step
[1:02:37] Hallelujah and I'm just going to step
[1:02:39] from this Dimension into another
[1:02:41] dimension
[1:02:45] Hallelujah and the faith that is in my
[1:02:49] heart now is what's leading me to that
[1:02:52] step
[1:02:59] Hallelujah
[1:03:02] we're resting on that
[1:03:05] we're resting on that
[1:03:07] but watch because
[1:03:09] he can't give a first revelation then
[1:03:10] the second revelation
[1:03:12] oh no no
[1:03:14] amen but he can give a revelation
[1:03:17] and then add to it
[1:03:18] brother Brown takes it back to Abraham
[1:03:20] he said he called Abraham he told him
[1:03:22] he'd be the father of many nations
[1:03:26] amen see that was the first revelation
[1:03:29] amen but then he began to add to that
[1:03:32] Revelation and he began to designate
[1:03:35] amen that seed would come through Sarah
[1:03:37] amen he began to give a fatherance of
[1:03:40] the same revelation
[1:03:43] listen friends I believe that bro that
[1:03:45] William random preached what Paul
[1:03:46] preached but Paul said when he began to
[1:03:49] talk about Melchizedek he said listen
[1:03:52] there's a lot of things we can say Amen
[1:03:55] but you become dull of hearing and when
[1:03:57] you have need to be you should be a
[1:03:59] teacher yourself you got neither you
[1:04:00] would be taught you ought to be eating
[1:04:02] meat but you're unskillful in the word
[1:04:04] and he said there's a lot of things that
[1:04:06] I could say about Melchizedek amen but
[1:04:09] but listen this is not the hour amen so
[1:04:11] I'm just going to give the Revelation
[1:04:13] and I'm going to leave the rest to the
[1:04:17] seventh angel Hallelujah and when he
[1:04:20] comes amen he'll give a father of the
[1:04:23] same Revelation and now we have a
[1:04:26] message who is
[1:04:29] listen for years not that Melchizedek
[1:04:32] but who is this Melchizedek who is this
[1:04:36] that is Among Us who is this amen this
[1:04:39] that's revealing these things oh I tell
[1:04:41] you this amen if all you see in this
[1:04:43] message is a man William Randall I got
[1:04:45] great respect for the prophet I've got
[1:04:47] great respect for his ministry you'll
[1:04:49] never hear this preacher belittling or
[1:04:52] diminishing amen or tearing down the
[1:04:54] ministry of thy Prophet but I tell you
[1:04:56] this if all you see in this in this
[1:04:59] message is a Ministry of a man you
[1:05:01] missed the whole point
[1:05:08] he said I was not the one that was
[1:05:11] standing down there that appeared that
[1:05:14] day down there on the river I was only
[1:05:16] standing near when he come
[1:05:18] Hallelujah I'm not the one that tells
[1:05:22] these things as perfect as they are it's
[1:05:25] not what I knew it's what I Surrender
[1:05:27] myself to hallelujah amen the angel is
[1:05:30] not the son of man he's a messenger Sin
[1:05:33] from the son of man but you are not
[1:05:35] feeding on the words of a man you're
[1:05:38] feeding on the body word of the son of
[1:05:41] man
[1:05:41] [Music]
[1:05:43] Hallelujah
[1:05:46] that's what's changing you
[1:05:56] ain't no different gospel
[1:06:00] ain't a different revelation
[1:06:02] hurry with me
[1:06:04] this is a continuation
[1:06:08] and by the way just so we're clear on
[1:06:11] this it ain't something outside the
[1:06:13] scripture
[1:06:16] come on Friends the revelation of the
[1:06:18] seals is not something outside of the
[1:06:20] scripture
[1:06:21] amen even you know the person come to
[1:06:23] brother brown one day he said with your
[1:06:25] qualifications you could write a 23rd
[1:06:27] chapter of Revelations it sounded good
[1:06:29] amen but listen it was contrary to the
[1:06:31] word amen because the Bible already said
[1:06:34] If any man had to or take away amen then
[1:06:38] the pledge will be added to him and his
[1:06:39] part be taken out of the book amen
[1:06:41] listen there is a prophet didn't come
[1:06:42] Amen to write another Bible
[1:06:46] he didn't come Amen to give a revelation
[1:06:49] outside of this Bible what he come to do
[1:06:51] is tie up all the Loose Ends and reveal
[1:06:54] the hidden truth that was contained in
[1:06:57] the scripture we had a Bible even for
[1:07:00] almost 2 000 Years brother Matt but we
[1:07:02] didn't know what we was reading but God
[1:07:05] rich in Mercy in these last days sent a
[1:07:09] prophet to the land and a prophet is a
[1:07:12] Divine interpreter of the word
[1:07:18] Hallelujah
[1:07:20] let me tell you something because you
[1:07:22] know brother Brown would just say people
[1:07:24] you know
[1:07:26] I'm in I'm in some I'm in another man's
[1:07:28] pulpits I try to be very respectful and
[1:07:31] and
[1:07:32] rightfully so
[1:07:34] and so I I walk with humility and I'm
[1:07:37] trying to you know I wanna I don't want
[1:07:40] to overstep any bounds in anything but I
[1:07:42] believe that I know your pastor's heart
[1:07:44] but
[1:07:45] amen how many thankful that you got a
[1:07:48] pastor that'll stay with the word
[1:07:57] I think y'all could I think you'd do
[1:07:59] better than that
[1:08:00] how many's glad you got a pastor and a
[1:08:03] state Church of the word
[1:08:08] Hallelujah listen there's all kind of
[1:08:11] ideas there's all kind of doctors
[1:08:13] there's been all kind of isms and
[1:08:15] schisms
[1:08:18] amen there's all kind of men out there
[1:08:20] with all kind of motives and objectives
[1:08:22] and they're building their own kingdoms
[1:08:24] and there's eight Messengers and
[1:08:25] everything else you can think of Amen
[1:08:28] but I'm glad that God has still got a
[1:08:30] true five-fold Ministry
[1:08:32] Hallelujah let me just say this I've
[1:08:35] done forgot about them notes so I'm
[1:08:37] preaching amen but I wanted to let you
[1:08:39] know something if there is a fake
[1:08:42] there's got to be a real
[1:08:45] brother bam comes along shows us if
[1:08:47] there's a bogus there had to be a real
[1:08:49] first

[1:08:53] had to be a real dollar
[1:08:56] so there's a bogus pastor
[1:09:01] there's got to be a real one
[1:09:04] if there's a bogus teacher there's got
[1:09:07] to be a real one if there's a focus
[1:09:09] evangelist there's got to be a real one
[1:09:12] well I'm gonna go ahead and say if
[1:09:13] there's a false prophet
[1:09:16] [Applause]

[1:09:48] didn't amen you didn't throw away all
[1:09:50] the real ones so why in the world Amen
[1:09:52] would you let the devil come along say
[1:09:54] point out every false Apostle and false
[1:09:57] prophet and false preacher amen and then
[1:09:59] you throw away all preachers just go
[1:10:01] listen don't throw the whole basket out
[1:10:03] cause of one rotten apple
[1:10:05] God still got men
[1:10:08] that'll preach the word God still got
[1:10:11] somebody that'll just say what a prophet
[1:10:13] said God still got some gospel preachers
[1:10:16] that'll take the gloves off and just
[1:10:19] call right right and wrong wrong
[1:10:22] Hallelujah and you ought to be thankful
[1:10:25] this morning that you got a pastor
[1:10:28] that ain't a people pleaser
[1:10:32] he ain't trying to make you happy he's
[1:10:35] trying to get you perfected Hallelujah I
[1:10:39] ain't here to try to preach you happy
[1:10:41] I'll be getting happy while I'm
[1:10:43] preaching even but there's some more
[1:10:44] important for us the ministry of this
[1:10:47] hour is for the perfecting of the Saints
[1:10:54] sometimes that word has to come and cut
[1:10:56] your hide
[1:10:58] but I tell you what if you're a real
[1:10:59] believer a Son of God you'll walk out of
[1:11:02] them doors with your hands lifted up and
[1:11:04] say thank you for the weapon Lord I
[1:11:06] needed it real fast
[1:11:08] [Applause]
[1:11:15] thank God for the truth
[1:11:26] listen
[1:11:27] the Bible said they tried them
[1:11:29] I forgot my
[1:11:31] well praise God I was going to say I
[1:11:33] forgot my phone so I don't know what
[1:11:35] time it is
[1:11:36] there's a huge clock back there
[1:11:40] foreign
[1:11:47] win the preacher
[1:11:51] it just it just all depends on who you
[1:11:53] compare me to
[1:11:54] [Music]
[1:11:59] they tried them
[1:12:01] you know what brother how did they try
[1:12:02] them
[1:12:03] by the word
[1:12:06] what gave them the right
[1:12:08] Paul
[1:12:10] and he tried it but listen friends you
[1:12:12] know what they did they took them every
[1:12:14] Ministry they heard you know what they
[1:12:16] did they took it back to the word
[1:12:19] and you know what they said they said
[1:12:22] you're a lie if they wasn't preaching
[1:12:23] what Paul already preached
[1:12:26] they stood right there and said you're a
[1:12:27] liar
[1:12:28] because you ain't saying what Paul said
[1:12:30] [Applause]
[1:12:32] listen I want to tell you I'm just going
[1:12:34] to give you this this morning don't you
[1:12:36] never try any men don't you judge it by
[1:12:39] the anointing
[1:12:40] [Applause]
[1:12:41] don't you judge it by how well he can
[1:12:43] speak don't you judge it by amen how he
[1:12:46] can put things together you take it back
[1:12:49] to the word
[1:12:50] and if he ain't saying what Paul said if
[1:12:53] he ain't saying what William Branham
[1:12:55] said listen I don't make no apology to
[1:12:57] say it this morning if they're not
[1:12:59] saying amen listen there's a lot of
[1:13:01] things you hear even around this message
[1:13:03] I can't find it in this Bible
[1:13:06] there's all kind of ideas come along say
[1:13:08] oh you don't even need to go to church
[1:13:09] now I think you'll never find that in
[1:13:11] this Bible
[1:13:14] say brother you better back up Listen to
[1:13:16] listen listen I know where I'm standing
[1:13:17] this morning you won't find that stuff
[1:13:19] in this my Bible says forsake not the
[1:13:22] assembling of yourselves together as a
[1:13:24] manner of some are even the much more as
[1:13:27] you see that they approach you friends
[1:13:29] there's either one of two things either
[1:13:31] they don't believe the days approaching
[1:13:32] or they've left the word one or the
[1:13:34] other amen because the Bible says amen
[1:13:37] is long list of risk as long as you've
[1:13:39] got an opportunity even you ought to
[1:13:41] come together amen and worship God and
[1:13:44] set under our ministry and hear the word
[1:13:46] of God preached in power
[1:13:51] there's a reason why the devil's trying
[1:13:53] to stop it
[1:13:59] because it'll be by the preaching of
[1:14:00] that word
[1:14:01] that lives will be changed
[1:14:04] the sick will be healed
[1:14:06] oh my God
[1:14:10] brother Brown said
[1:14:12] he said
[1:14:16] the Keystone of the whole Bible is the
[1:14:18] Revelation that God never changes
[1:14:23] and not his his ways are as just as
[1:14:26] unchangeable as he is
[1:14:29] Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same
[1:14:32] yesterday today and forever
[1:14:35] Ecclesiastes 3 14 I know that whatsoever
[1:14:37] God doeth it shall be forever nothing
[1:14:40] can be put to it nor anything taken from
[1:14:42] it and God doeth it that men should fear
[1:14:45] before him that which has been is now
[1:14:48] and that which is to be hath already
[1:14:51] been and God required that which is past
[1:14:54] what is that it's showing you the
[1:14:56] revelation of an unchanging God
[1:14:59] this is very powerful because if God is
[1:15:01] in fact unchanging in his nature in his
[1:15:04] Essence amen how many believes that God
[1:15:07] never changes his nature never changes
[1:15:10] amen if that is a is if that is true
[1:15:13] then every action of God is a prophecy
[1:15:18] so bro what do you mean by that I mean
[1:15:20] but I mean this that if God don't change
[1:15:23] if he did something one time
[1:15:27] if the same circumstances ever repeat
[1:15:31] then God will have to do the same thing
[1:15:33] again
[1:15:35] [Applause]
[1:15:37] Hallelujah friends that's powerful and
[1:15:41] the prophet is going to show you
[1:15:42] something very powerful out of it
[1:15:43] because he said if God ever healed a
[1:15:46] person one time
[1:15:49] and you meet the same requirements
[1:15:52] then if God is a just God he'll have to
[1:15:55] do the same thing for you
[1:15:57] [Applause]
[1:16:11] if you did it once listen he'll have to
[1:16:13] do it again
[1:16:15] you believe that
[1:16:18] praise God
[1:16:20] I guess I spoke too soon about not being
[1:16:22] long-winded
[1:16:24] I preach the batteries out
[1:16:28] but
[1:16:30] listen you see but you see what I'm
[1:16:32] saying you you understand if you meet
[1:16:35] the same requirements if you come with
[1:16:37] the same attitude amen and God has not
[1:16:40] changed I love what brother Brown said
[1:16:42] amen he said God's attitude towards you
[1:16:44] is revealed in the seven Redemptive
[1:16:45] names amen amen how many knows amen that
[1:16:48] he's Jehovah Jireh he's a provider so if
[1:16:51] you've got a need God's attitude towards
[1:16:53] you is I'm your provider
[1:16:56] Hallelujah he's Jehovah Rapha he's a
[1:16:59] Healer amen so if you're sick this
[1:17:01] morning God's attitude towards you is he
[1:17:04] is a Healer
[1:17:05] [Applause]
[1:17:09] oh yes sir and God never changes it's
[1:17:12] the Keystone of the whole Bible listen
[1:17:14] I'll just tell you this friends men
[1:17:16] change churches change seasons change
[1:17:19] Fashions change
[1:17:21] Everything Changes
[1:17:22] but God don't never change
[1:17:28] see the discrepancy brother Brown said
[1:17:30] now this is Harvest Time
[1:17:32] he said at the beginning when God sowed
[1:17:34] his seed into the Earth he gave it into
[1:17:36] the hearts of his children his family to
[1:17:38] keep that word that was their only
[1:17:40] defense to keep the word and here the
[1:17:43] enemy come in and broke that barrier by
[1:17:45] sowing a seed of discrepancy contrary to
[1:17:48] the word of God if that was a
[1:17:49] discrepancy in the beginning it's still
[1:17:51] anything that will add anything to the
[1:17:53] word of God is still a seed of
[1:17:55] discrepancy I don't care where it comes
[1:17:58] from I don't care if it's organization
[1:17:59] military sources political Pirates
[1:18:02] anything that's contrary to the word of
[1:18:04] God is a seed of discrepancy when a man
[1:18:08] stands and says he's a gospel preacher
[1:18:10] and says at the days of Miracles has
[1:18:12] passed that's a seed of discrepancy when
[1:18:15] a man stands and says that he's a
[1:18:16] minister a pastor of a church somewhere
[1:18:19] and he does not believe that Jesus
[1:18:21] Christ is the same in every detail
[1:18:23] except the physical body the same
[1:18:25] yesterday today and forever that's a
[1:18:27] seed a discrepancy when he says the
[1:18:29] Miracles in Apostolic age as past as a
[1:18:32] seed a discrepancy when they say there's
[1:18:34] no such thing as Divine Healing that's a
[1:18:36] seed a discrepancy
[1:18:38] when they come along and say that God
[1:18:40] don't feel with the Holy Ghost no more
[1:18:42] that's a seed a discrepancy
[1:18:45] [Applause]
[1:18:45] [Music]
[1:18:48] that's what brother man said in the
[1:18:50] church take a book
[1:18:52] he said those Scholars may tell you the
[1:18:54] apostolic age is over don't you believe
[1:18:57] it
[1:18:59] such a statement is wrong on two
[1:19:01] accounts first of all it's wrong to
[1:19:03] Suppose there ain't any more Apostles
[1:19:04] just because the original 12 are dead
[1:19:07] and an apostle means one cent
[1:19:10] amen and there are many sent ones today
[1:19:12] but they're called missionaries as long
[1:19:14] as men are being called and sent forth
[1:19:16] with a Word of Life the apostolic age is
[1:19:18] going on
[1:19:20] secondly they refer to an age of the
[1:19:23] manifestation of the holy ghost power as
[1:19:25] being over since the Bible has been
[1:19:27] completed that is untrue there's not
[1:19:29] even one scripture that suggests that
[1:19:31] but many conclusively state otherwise
[1:19:33] here is the proof that both of these
[1:19:35] charges are false Acts 2 verse 38 then
[1:19:38] Peter said unto them repent and be
[1:19:40] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:19:42] Jesus Christ for their mission of your
[1:19:43] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[1:19:46] the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto
[1:19:48] you and your children and them that are
[1:19:50] far off even as many as the Lord Our God
[1:19:53] shall call the promise of power we see
[1:19:56] Apostles we're in due with it Pentecost
[1:19:58] is to you the Jews and to your children
[1:20:00] Jews them that are far off Gentiles
[1:20:06] Hallelujah you ought to shout the
[1:20:08] building down on that one brother amen
[1:20:10] because amen you are not even in the
[1:20:12] Commonwealth of Israel having no hope no
[1:20:15] promise amen but God rich in Mercy
[1:20:19] Hallelujah has broke down the middle
[1:20:22] wall partition amen and made us all what
[1:20:24] and now through Jesus Christ you have
[1:20:27] become the Seed of Abraham with the
[1:20:29] promise Hallelujah and This Promise is
[1:20:32] unto you
[1:20:34] he said that Jesus your children the
[1:20:36] Jews and them that are far off that's
[1:20:40] the Gentiles that we that we're far off
[1:20:42] we're brought nigh by the blood of Jesus
[1:20:46] Christ
[1:20:47] [Applause]
[1:20:51] [Music]
[1:20:52] that ain't even the end of it
[1:20:54] he said even as many
[1:20:57] as the Lord our Gods shall call
[1:21:01] listen where the prophet of God said
[1:21:03] amen until he stops calling
[1:21:07] the Pentecostal message and power will
[1:21:10] not cease
[1:21:13] how many believe that's the truth and
[1:21:16] let me just stop and say this before I
[1:21:18] go any further amen when I'm talking
[1:21:20] about Pentecost I ain't talking about no
[1:21:22] organization
[1:21:24] I ain't talking about this denomination
[1:21:25] out here I ain't even talking about
[1:21:27] 1906. amen I'm talking about the
[1:21:30] original
[1:21:31] [Applause]
[1:21:33] church that was born on the day of
[1:21:35] Pentecost
[1:21:36] hallelujah amen Pentecost is not an
[1:21:40] organization
[1:21:42] it's an experience
[1:21:44] [Applause]
[1:21:51] Brown said what the church had at
[1:21:53] Pentecost is an enable right
[1:21:55] originally she had the pure word of God
[1:21:57] she had the power of the spirit
[1:21:59] manifested in diverse diverse signs and
[1:22:01] wonders gifts of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:22:03] Hebrews 2 amen therefore we ought to
[1:22:05] give more earnesty to the things which
[1:22:07] you've heard unless at any time we
[1:22:09] should let them slip forth the word
[1:22:10] spoken by Angels was steadfast in every
[1:22:13] transgression and Disobedience to the
[1:22:15] word received a just recompense of
[1:22:16] reward how shall we escape if we neglect
[1:22:19] so great of Salvation which at the first
[1:22:21] begin to be spoken by the Lord and was
[1:22:22] confirmed on us by them that heard him
[1:22:24] God also bearing them witness both with
[1:22:27] signs and wonders and diverse Miracles
[1:22:29] gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his
[1:22:31] own will the original church was not
[1:22:34] organized by men
[1:22:37] it was led by the Holy Ghost
[1:22:41] Hallelujah and let me just say Amen thou
[1:22:44] was the original church that was the
[1:22:47] alpha church this is the Omega church
[1:22:50] amen and the Omega has to match the
[1:22:53] alpha
[1:22:56] we are not organized by men
[1:23:00] church I'm going to tell you this bride
[1:23:02] is not being led by men
[1:23:05] amen this bride is being led by the Holy
[1:23:08] Ghost
[1:23:09] amen we ain't got no Bishops
[1:23:13] I'm gonna say it again we ain't got no
[1:23:16] Bishops there ain't no group of men even
[1:23:19] though we're following
[1:23:20] amen I only think I can say as Paul said
[1:23:24] Paul said come follow me as I follow
[1:23:28] Christ
[1:23:29] does God use me and sure he does Amen
[1:23:32] but the church is not organized by men
[1:23:34] nor led by men the church has been
[1:23:37] brought together under the power of the
[1:23:40] Holy Ghost and is being led by the power
[1:23:42] of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:44] [Applause]
[1:23:50] brother the band said
[1:23:52] it was hated and despised it was
[1:23:54] oppressed it was persecuted unto death
[1:23:56] but it was true to God
[1:24:00] and stay true to the original pattern
[1:24:04] [Music]
[1:24:05] listen friends we ain't got but one
[1:24:07] pattern
[1:24:10] there's only one there's only one
[1:24:13] Church
[1:24:14] that we should pattern ourselves after
[1:24:18] how many believes in the sovereignty of
[1:24:20] the of the local church
[1:24:22] brother Brown believed in the
[1:24:23] sovereignty of the local church
[1:24:25] and I believe that that is actually what
[1:24:28] comes under attack through
[1:24:29] denominational denominationalism
[1:24:31] organized religion amen what is it it's
[1:24:33] stripping away the sovereignty
[1:24:35] of the local church
[1:24:37] amen and begins to tell men what to
[1:24:39] preach and when to preach and how to
[1:24:41] preach and amen this is going to be you
[1:24:44] know come on Friends amen and if you're
[1:24:46] going to be a part of this and we're
[1:24:47] going to give you any kind of backing
[1:24:49] and then you're going to have to allow
[1:24:50] this and and we're going to okay this
[1:24:53] you don't believe I'm telling the truth
[1:24:55] go talk to some United methodists right
[1:24:57] now and you'll find out how true it is
[1:24:59] come on Friends amen and it's stripping
[1:25:02] away The Sovereign he's stripping away
[1:25:03] the sovereignty amen because God
[1:25:05] intended for his church to be led by the
[1:25:07] Holy Ghost amen and your pastor ought
[1:25:10] not have to call nobody up and get
[1:25:12] permission
[1:25:13] [Applause]
[1:25:14] amen if he's going to preach a certain
[1:25:16] thing on a certain day amen he ain't got
[1:25:18] to get okay from somebody from some Pope
[1:25:20] or something amen okay well I guess
[1:25:22] you're pretty no no no hey man he's got
[1:25:23] one boss Hallelujah I got one boss
[1:25:26] brother Matt's got one ball listen for
[1:25:28] his we got to be Lego you say brother
[1:25:30] don't you believe that the church is
[1:25:31] United under one headship I sure do amen
[1:25:34] but it ain't a group of men hallelujah
[1:25:36] it's not some man it's Jesus Christ
[1:25:39] Hallelujah he is our head
[1:25:43] and the bride will be knotted under his
[1:25:45] ship
[1:25:46] [Applause]
[1:25:47] [Music]
[1:25:51] and the only pattern we got
[1:25:54] is the early church
[1:25:57] and brother Branham said every church
[1:25:59] will be striving to be like that church
[1:26:05] Hallelujah I told my church at home I
[1:26:08] said listen we ain't trying to be like
[1:26:09] the church down the road
[1:26:11] no offense to them we love them we
[1:26:13] appreciate them amen but listen amen
[1:26:15] churches are different
[1:26:18] amen and churches are sovereign amen and
[1:26:21] I'm not trying to match my church with
[1:26:22] another church and you're not trying to
[1:26:24] match this church with another church
[1:26:26] amen but we're all amen we got one
[1:26:29] pattern amen and that's the church that
[1:26:31] was born on the day of Pentecost
[1:26:33] Hallelujah if we're striving to be like
[1:26:35] something it's got to be that
[1:26:37] foreign
[1:26:42] I've always said
[1:26:44] it's a great matching time
[1:26:46] he said
[1:26:47] you you paint your steps red watch your
[1:26:50] neighbor paint his red
[1:26:52] he said you watch he said he said some
[1:26:56] of the women will wear a certain kind of
[1:26:57] hat at church and watch the rest of them
[1:26:59] get that same hat
[1:27:01] Jacqueline Kennedy had her water head
[1:27:04] haircut I don't even know what that is
[1:27:06] but amen I guess I but anyhow I mean
[1:27:09] look at all the women amen she wore them
[1:27:11] little Old Sac colored aprons and things
[1:27:13] like that and scandalous for a woman to
[1:27:15] be out on the street stretched out like
[1:27:17] that and look at all the women doing the
[1:27:19] same thing it's an impersonation
[1:27:21] amen but that's in the world
[1:27:24] but the church people picked it up
[1:27:26] and it's a shame that they do it it's
[1:27:28] wrong for them to do it it's a disgrace
[1:27:30] and when we see it creeping into
[1:27:32] Pentecost it's more disgraceful that's
[1:27:34] right but you see the church puts up
[1:27:36] with it and lets it go I don't care I've
[1:27:39] never cared whether my coat match my
[1:27:41] trousers or my time match my coat I want
[1:27:45] my experience to match God's Bible and
[1:27:48] his requirements and that's what we
[1:27:50] Pentecostal people ought to do is have
[1:27:53] our experience just like theirs was
[1:27:54] because he is the same Jesus the Same
[1:27:57] Holy Ghost the same power and he's
[1:28:00] living today
[1:28:03] hallelujah how many of you have that
[1:28:05] desire this one listen friends I ain't
[1:28:07] trying to Max much I'm not trying to be
[1:28:10] amen listen I'm just going to be
[1:28:12] straight with you and just can I let go
[1:28:14] and preach for a minute hey man I'm just
[1:28:16] going to go ahead and tell you I'm not
[1:28:17] trying to be Donnie Reagan I ain't
[1:28:20] Donnie Reagan no disrespecting him I
[1:28:22] appreciate his gift probably no greater
[1:28:24] one of the greatest preachers ever lived
[1:28:27] but I can't be him and I ain't trying to
[1:28:29] be like him
[1:28:31] for me to try to be like him is an
[1:28:33] impersonation
[1:28:37] I trying to be brother Branham
[1:28:40] Amen Let Me
[1:28:42] let me just
[1:28:43] that is not my place not my Ministry

[1:28:51] story one time amen and I so identified

[1:29:14] that flag because he's amen that's
[1:29:16] reminding them of what they're fighting
[1:29:18] for of who they're fighting for and what
[1:29:21] they stand for it's very important you

[1:31:35] let me just try to
[1:31:39] come to a close I know my time is gone
[1:31:42] man you
[1:31:44] you're a wonderful group to preach to
[1:31:45] you
[1:31:48] watch what the what the prophet said
[1:31:49] here in the churches book
[1:31:51] he said the messenger of Malachi 4
[1:31:54] and Revelations 10 7 is going to do two
[1:31:56] things
[1:31:58] I'm going to try to close right here
[1:32:00] but according to Malachi 4 he will turn
[1:32:02] the hearts of the children
[1:32:04] back to the faith of the fathers
[1:32:07] right
[1:32:08] and he will rip the second thing is he
[1:32:10] will reveal the mysteries of the seven
[1:32:12] thunders in Revelations 10 which are the
[1:32:15] revelations contained in the Seven Seals
[1:32:16] it will be these divinely revealed
[1:32:19] mystery truths that will literally
[1:32:22] right that will literally
[1:32:24] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:32:26] Pentecostal fathers exactly so listen
[1:32:29] friends I want you to understand
[1:32:30] something this morning this message is a
[1:32:33] message of restoration
[1:32:35] Hallelujah watch where the Prophet said
[1:32:37] in the first seal he said I love this
[1:32:39] other reformers but that great they were
[1:32:41] great men of God seeing the need of the
[1:32:43] day they brought a Reformation
[1:32:44] Revelation 10 said that his message was
[1:32:46] to reveal not the reform to reveal the
[1:32:49] secret that reveal the secrets the word
[1:32:52] see in the man what would it Hebrews 4
[1:32:55] so the word of God is sharper than a
[1:32:57] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[1:32:59] center of the bone a revealer of the
[1:33:01] secrets of the heart see the man is not
[1:33:03] a reformer he's a revealer a revealer of
[1:33:07] what the mysteries of God or the church
[1:33:09] has got all tied up in everything he has
[1:33:12] to come forth with the word of God to
[1:33:13] reveal the thing out because he is here
[1:33:16] to restore the faith of the children
[1:33:18] back to the father's
[1:33:21] Hallelujah the original Bible faith is
[1:33:25] to be restored by the seventh angel
[1:33:30] the original Bible faith
[1:33:33] now it's the holy spirit in the last
[1:33:35] days
[1:33:36] to shine forth the evening lights
[1:33:37] restoring back the faith that was
[1:33:39] trampled down through the denominations
[1:33:41] condemned the denominations coming back
[1:33:43] to the original Faith the original Bible
[1:33:46] Faith the original Bible believing every
[1:33:49] word not adding to it making it say this
[1:33:51] and making it say that just say it the
[1:33:53] way it said amen and you want to believe
[1:33:56] it that way how many wants to believe it
[1:33:58] that way and we're promised that to
[1:34:00] restore every voice has a message behind
[1:34:03] it and the message was to restore the
[1:34:05] faith back to the original faith of Amen
[1:34:08] Malachi for a restore back the faith of
[1:34:10] the fathers to the people they've got
[1:34:12] off in all kinds of everything they'll
[1:34:14] restore it back again that faith that
[1:34:17] meant the message of the hour is to
[1:34:20] return back to the word
[1:34:27] the prophecy with the restoration of the
[1:34:29] word
[1:34:30] will come a restoration of the power
[1:34:34] listen to me that's why he that's why a
[1:34:37] prophet told us brother Matt he said
[1:34:39] 1906 Pentecost restoration of the gifts
[1:34:42] was not the long-awaited restoration
[1:34:44] that was prophesied in the Bible in Joel
[1:34:47] chapter 2.
[1:34:49] he said it could not be because the
[1:34:51] former or the teaching Reign had not
[1:34:53] failed yet the word had not been
[1:34:55] restored back to the church at that time
[1:34:57] amen and and that restoration would be a
[1:35:01] restoration under the word the former
[1:35:03] latter rain falling in the same month

[1:35:33] all the years amen that was lost all the
[1:35:38] years and remember amen there were four
[1:35:40] bugs but a prophet comes along says it
[1:35:43] was only one bug really in reality in
[1:35:45] four stages and ties it right back Amen
[1:35:48] to the horse horses of Revelation 6 and
[1:35:51] the Antichrist Spirit coming in four
[1:35:53] stages against the church amen but he
[1:35:56] said I will restore and what did he say
[1:35:58] in the restoration of the Bright Tree
[1:36:00] four messengers of death amen destroy
[1:36:02] the thing and ate the tree down before
