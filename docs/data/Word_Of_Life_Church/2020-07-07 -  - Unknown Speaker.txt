TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now Watson verse 12 not as Cain who was of that wicked one let me read you this from Jean Gil who was of the wicked one Satan he was a child of his an imitator of him one that appeared to be under his influence to belong to him so that you say of Cain that he was of the side of the serpent now I thought we were the only strange ones that believed serpent seed but John Gill and some of these other men were gonna read you about tonight that wrote back in the 1500s and the 1600s and the 1700s believe the strange thing and John who lived back 2,000 years ago said the cane was of the devil raised the Lord all night so that you say have came that he was of the side of the serpent that o serpent the devil that old serpent the devil as the way of the serpent is destroy him to kill so Cain immediately became a murder and again because Cain came from the side of the Angel of Death he slew his brother listen to this from the Bible exposition commentary Cain is an example of a life of hatred Cain is not presented as an atheist he is presented as a worshipper and this is the point children of the devil masquerade as true believers they attend religious gatherings as Cain did they may even bring offerings but these actions in themselves are not valid proof that a man is born of God the real test in his love is for the Brethren where Cain failed every man has a spiritual lineage as well as a physical cane spiritual fire wise the devil taints attitudes and actions originated with Satan Cain was a murderer and a liar like Satan was st. John 8:44 he murdered his brother and any lied about it now lies hidden leave commentaries with Lester's quotes every member Cain wasn't an infidel Cain was a believer this is going to shake the gizzard out of you so if you got a gizzard in you to nod I guess this clothes gonna shake it out which I hope it does because only chickens got gizzards you know evening Eagles don't have gizzards I guess I hope it does some of you fundamentalists and put a heart in you that's right a hard to believe Cain was religious and a believer he came up and built an altar to the Lord with just as much faith that's what Abel did I want to watch want you to watch something god it's just so you believe that audience he is absolutely just enough God on a requires of religion Cain was just as just as Abel was both those boys came before God Cain wasn't a communist he wasn't an infidel an unbeliever he was a believer if God only requires a believer he was unjust to condemn Cain I wonder hemming around the message and what do we call him the same thing Cain was called believers why we substitute believers from being born again if you got the Holy Ghost if you got the Holy Ghost why because people can say more positive yes I'm a believer yes I'm a believer but pinpointing are you born again you know I don't know our hope I you know why don't you see what it is it's easier to say well I'm a believer I follow the message ah brother darling should good man I'm a believer I'm a believer all the tangka say exactly the same thing I want to say more than came to say [Applause] came to say I'm a believer he could say I'm sincere I'm a worshipper I love God I want to say more than that I want to say that too I want to say I'm a believer I'm a worshipper I'm sincere but I want to say I'm born of God I passed some death unto life and one way I know is I don't want to murder anybody
