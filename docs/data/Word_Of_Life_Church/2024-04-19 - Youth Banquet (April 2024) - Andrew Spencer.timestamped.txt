[1:14] sister Khloe Hara has put this skit
[1:16] together for all of you and she has done
[1:18] a wonderful job we hope you enjoy it I
[1:20] have seen pieces of it and I think you
[1:22] will really really be inspired by what
[1:25] you see remember these are uh you know
[1:28] these are not professional actors though
[1:30] might be a few mistakes so we hope that
[1:31] you have Grace for them and uh and
[1:34] really really touched my heart when I
[1:36] saw them practice it has been a long
[1:38] time since we've done anything having to
[1:40] do with a skit with our little assembly
[1:42] and and it's just so nice to see them
[1:44] participate for for your benefit so
[1:47] please go ahead and like I said move
[1:48] your seats so you can get a good chair I
[1:50] don't want you to be obstructed by any
[1:51] of the
[1:52] table
[1:55] candles and we'll be starting shortly
[1:58] this kid is named Just As You Are
[2:02] thank
[2:14] you we find ourselves in Great king
[2:17] Tim's throne room on the seventh day of
[2:19] the great banquet the King has just sent
[2:22] for his Queen vashi so that all may
[2:24] observe how fair she
[2:26] is as you guys know my kingdom Reigns
[2:30] from Ethiopia to India and you know I
[2:33] have to deal with the Phoenicians the
[2:34] Egyptians and everything it's kind of
[2:36] crazy but these new AG westerners these
[2:39] benites these Spencer ites and don't
[2:42] even get me started on these raganit
[2:43] that I have to deal with okay oh look
[2:45] here comes one
[2:49] now your majesty what's going on what's
[2:52] up I come from the queen vashi my king
[2:57] the queen has refused to attend your
[2:59] Royal Bank banquet tonight what her
[3:01] exact words were tell the king that I am
[3:04] much too busy and have much better
[3:06] things to do with my precious time than
[3:09] to attend his stupid banquet yikes
[3:12] that's rough are you just going to take
[3:15] that that is so disrespectful that woman
[3:18] needs to be put in her
[3:20] place man if the queen can treat the
[3:22] king like this my wife's going to stop
[3:24] doing the dishes and start to think she
[3:26] can boss me around this is outrageous
[3:29] who does she think she is all I want for
[3:32] her to do is spend time with me but she
[3:34] can't even do that your majesty it
[3:36] sounds to me like you got yourself a
[3:38] queen who has a feminine Spirit on her
[3:40] that is not going to go over well in
[3:41] your kingdom it's going to spread like
[3:44] wildfire I agree Tim you need to find
[3:47] yourself a new wife one that is worthy
[3:49] to be called your bride not someone who
[3:52] thinks she is higher than you but
[3:53] someone who will rule by your side you
[3:56] know what you make a good point let's
[3:58] have a meeting with her tomorrow
[3:59] tomorrow so we can send her away and
[4:01] then ha guy we'll get all the young
[4:02] eligible maintenance in the land and
[4:04] find one among them to replace
[4:12] [Applause]
[4:17] her okay look don't look too
[4:19] intimidating I know that's really easy
[4:21] for you John Michael but Josiah let's
[4:23] just come it down let's make this as
[4:25] easy as possible for
[4:28] her oh my goodness here here comes the
[4:30] Moose
[4:33] now yeah go ahead I don't understand so
[4:37] what if I didn't come I do so much for
[4:40] you I've redecorated the entire Palace
[4:42] I've gotten you a whole new wardrobe so
[4:45] you can be a stylish King I even got you
[4:48] this
[4:49] poodle hey bud I did not want that okay
[4:54] anything I could ever want is at my
[4:56] disposal I'm the king I can set my
[4:58] fingers and I can have it and don't even
[5:01] get me started on this Ukrainian looking
[5:04] poodle okay everything that you've
[5:06] bought me has been with my own money so
[5:09] the one thing that you could have given
[5:11] me that you didn't was your love and
[5:13] your time but you're too busy you're too
[5:17] busy being a vain Queen and not setting
[5:19] an example so how about you do this take
[5:22] Mr poodle and get out of my face that is
[5:26] a Miss poodle to you I believe
[5:30] oh my goodness
[5:39] gracious now the king dismissed vashi
[5:42] and sent out letters to all the princes
[5:43] of the land stating that the single
[5:45] ladies were to present themselves as
[5:47] candidates to be the next
[5:51] Queen all right waiting on one
[5:55] more oh There She is welcome ladies I am
[5:58] hay I the messenger from the King and
[6:01] today I'm going to be preparing teaching
[6:04] you to prepare yourself for the king so
[6:07] one of the things that you need to know
[6:08] about King Tim is he loves Simplicity
[6:11] it's his favorite thing in the world he
[6:13] also loves music and his favorite color
[6:15] is
[6:18] blue have y'all heard a word I've said
[6:20] this whole time oh are you talking okay
[6:23] so I can tell there's only one person
[6:25] listening to me and that's Esther over
[6:26] there she's already even got the color
[6:28] blue on even before I even said anything
[6:30] she's taking down notes heeding my words
[6:33] and she's going to do very well for the
[6:34] king he's very particular and he is not
[6:36] going to take another vashy are you
[6:38] kidding me with this guy he acts like he
[6:40] knows it all like he's some important
[6:43] Angel Sent From Heaven I mean really
[6:45] does he think I need help pleasing the
[6:47] king look at me I'm literally
[6:49] perfect I know right who doesn't want to
[6:53] be like our girl vashy she be out there
[6:57] living her life not listen into nobody
[7:01] honestly I think the king just wanted
[7:03] someone younger and like with better
[7:06] hair what if her bow talk stopped
[7:10] working bless her heart I feel so bad
[7:13] for her but honestly it's great for us
[7:16] right I mean it just feels right it's
[7:19] almost like I was created for such a
[7:22] time as this I know I have spent my
[7:25] entire life training for this moment
[7:28] right here ever since I was a little
[7:30] girl my mother always knew something
[7:32] like this was going to happen for me I
[7:35] think I know what I'm doing more than
[7:37] hey gu does but I cannot say the same
[7:40] thing about Esther though look at her
[7:42] she's literally taking notes what a nerd
[7:46] she's so quiet and compliant I'm sorry
[7:49] is this a safe space okay good because I
[7:53] just can't see how her and those
[7:55] horrible split ends that I can see all
[7:58] the way from here are not GNA please the
[8:00] king I just someone had to say it okay I
[8:04] think someone needs to say this about
[8:05] you four talking this badly about Esther
[8:08] so like you said this is a safe space
[8:11] you for put the fool in foolish virgin
[8:14] that's all I'm saying so I will give you
[8:17] one more opportunity to have a chance
[8:19] with the King and if you don't heed my
[8:21] words the rest is in your hands so
[8:23] you're going to each need to come up
[8:25] with a talent or a gift to
[8:28] theing gifts a talent or a king or oh my
[8:32] word if you were like Esther you would
[8:33] have known that I said you'd like to do
[8:35] something involving music because that's
[8:37] what the king loves that's all I'm
[8:39] saying I am the most fit girl there is I
[8:42] just hit my PR with 500 plates yeah I
[8:46] know and I am going to beat his
[8:49] strongest man in arm wrestling like easy
[8:51] peasy lemon squeezy well I am an artist
[8:55] at heart and I'm going to paint the king
[8:59] the most beautiful painting he has ever
[9:02] seen and guess what the painting is
[9:04] going to be me because there's truly no
[9:08] one more beautiful than
[9:10] I well I need to spill some tea on her
[9:13] Queen bashy I mean I love her but I
[9:16] heard she didn't want to entertain for
[9:18] the king he needs to look no further
[9:20] because I'm basically viral on the gram
[9:23] for my acting skills I have like a
[9:26] thousand followers I know I'm waiting
[9:28] for that blue sh any day now I am so
[9:32] going to follow you well I think I'm
[9:36] just going to bake the king a cake way
[9:39] to a man's heart for sure like not to
[9:41] brag or anything but not only am I the
[9:44] best baker in the land I'm also the most
[9:48] beautiful the most kind the most
[9:51] thoughtful the most humble Baker in all
[9:53] of the land girls did you not hear what

[9:59] King wanted
[10:00] Simplicity that he enjoyed
[10:03] music I'm telling you that guy hey guy
[10:07] guy whatever does not know what he's
[10:09] talking about hagy was appointed by the
[10:11] king to instruct us to make us look and
[10:14] act like a bride that the king desires
[10:17] he has been in the presence of the king
[10:19] and he knows what the king likes because
[10:20] the king told him how could you know
[10:23] better than the appointed one of the
[10:24] king Esther you are thinking like so
[10:28] deep into this
[10:30] we clearly know what we're doing you do
[10:33] you though and good luck with that
[10:36] you'll need
[10:46] it for the next months the girls
[10:49] perfected their many talents and gifts
[10:52] and spent many many many
[10:55] hours PR pampering themselves making
[10:58] sure that they would look good for the
[10:59] king each one thought that they knew
[11:01] best how to please the king Esther
[11:03] however listened to hegi and did only
[11:06] what he told her to do soon enough the
[11:08] day to meet the king would

[11:22] standing in front of them I'm just not
[11:25] sure how the king is going to pick one

[22:05] [Music]
[22:29] thank you all for your
[22:31] attentiveness as our young couples
[22:34] performed just as you are that
[22:36] encapsulates the crowning of Queen Queen
[22:39] Esther Our Hope for this skit this play
[22:43] was that you bring it brings to
[22:45] remembrance that when he chose
[22:48] you you know we we watched the actors
[22:52] portray those that would be
[22:54] Queen they brought all their abilities
[22:56] all their works
[22:58] the things that they felt like they
[23:00] could do themselves that they would give
[23:02] God and they would give to the king and
[23:05] their abilities would make make the king
[23:07] a better
[23:10] King
[23:12] remember he gave them a year to
[23:15] prepare and in the preparation they were
[23:17] supposed to prepare for this day when
[23:19] they was to meet the king and bring
[23:21] themselves before the king but during
[23:22] that whole time they were supposed to be
[23:24] listening to what Hagi was telling them
[23:27] this is what the king designed IR s this
[23:29] is what the king
[23:31] wants and we know what the king wanted
[23:34] was Esther
[23:36] brought
[23:38] nothing that's what the king wanted from
[23:42] Esther nothing as we heard Hagi speak to
[23:45] us this
[23:46] week when he
[23:48] said what you can bring to God is
[23:52] nothing tonight hay will speak to you
[23:56] again hay will tell tell you what you
[23:59] need to bring to the king and he I will
[24:02] again tell you
[24:03] tonight come as you
[24:06] are don't bring
[24:08] anything you've got nothing in your life
[24:12] that would make him a better
[24:14] God you have nothing to offer
[24:17] him that would make you a better
[24:22] Esther so tonight if we would
[24:25] heed what Hagi told him
[24:29] understand what God's desires are for
[24:32] you God's desires for you is fellowship
[24:35] God's desire for you is to Crown you God
[24:37] God wants you to bring nothing and God
[24:39] wants to give you
[24:41] everything because he already has
[24:43] everything so we hope that the skit that
[24:46] you heard tonight will bring to
[24:48] remembrance God wants you just as you
[24:51] are it ain't your abilities it's not how
[24:54] good a Christian you could try to
[24:56] be you let God live through you you let
[24:59] the King live through you that's what he
[25:02] wants so we hope you were blessed by
[25:04] that we hope the rest of the evening
[25:06] blesses you and we we thank you very
[25:09] much for for coming and for if you would
[25:12] give the hand to the actors and to Khloe
[25:15] Hera for riding this

[38:44] Donnie if he would please come up and
[38:45] introduce our speaker and uh and just
[38:47] know that that we love you with all of
[38:49] our hearts and I pray that the
[38:50] atmosphere so fills your heart tonight
[38:53] that you uh leave this place being
[38:54] blessed
[39:08] it's certainly been our privilege to be
[39:10] able to host this time um we're so
[39:14] grateful for those of you that have come
[39:17] and be sure when you go back home to
[39:20] express our appreciation to your pastor
[39:22] and church family for um being able to
[39:26] allow you to come we're so grateful for
[39:28] that as a pastor you kind of guard your
[39:30] sheep and watch them as far as where
[39:33] they go and all that so we count it an
[39:36] honor that your pastors would feel like
[39:39] that you could come and spend this time
[39:40] with us and feel like you wouldn't be
[39:42] hurt or you know anything like that my
[39:46] mind as I look at this occasion
[39:49] tonight and I hope with all of my heart
[39:53] that there will be none of us missing
[39:57] at the great King's
[39:59] banquet but that's the most important
[40:02] thing in our
[40:03] life every young person here tonight
[40:06] that was allowed to be here and
[40:07] participate in this had to be
[40:11] registered your name had to be there
[40:14] your pastor's name and all the different
[40:16] information that you
[40:18] gave even so for the marriage supper of
[40:20] the Lamb people can't just come because
[40:23] they want
[40:24] to but you have to be invited
[40:28] and then you respond to that
[40:30] invitation we're grateful for all the
[40:34] preparation thank the Lord for all those
[40:36] that waited on you tonight and um many
[40:40] of the sisters have been working working
[40:41] all this decoration and all the things
[40:43] that they've done we so appreciate them
[40:46] for doing that we're really privileged
[40:48] to have brother Andrew Spencer going to
[40:50] come and speak for us now I want to just
[40:53] open our hearts and see what the Lord
[40:55] has I'm sure you have needs in your life
[40:57] life you have a need you just want to
[40:58] raise your hand to the Lord that he'll
[41:01] just take our
[41:02] brother and remember that a gift in a
[41:05] man's life is there to help him get out
[41:07] of the way but you can pull on that gift
[41:10] and God can be able to minister to you
[41:12] through that gift a banquet is a
[41:15] different type setting than church but
[41:18] we know that it can also be a place by
[41:21] which great wonderful things can happen
[41:24] and I find it amazing that when we go we
[41:27] find fin make the Rapture and we go into
[41:29] the presence of
[41:31] God and we are there and that table is
[41:34] set thousands of miles long and the
[41:37] great king will come out and he'll walk
[41:40] by each of your
[41:42] chairs and you will finally have your
[41:45] opportunity to look at Jesus in the
[41:49] face most of us probably is going to be
[41:53] crying he will reach down and grab a
[41:55] hold of His Garment
[41:57] and pull it
[41:59] up and rub the tears from your
[42:02] eyes we're here tonight that we might
[42:06] have a little more
[42:08] preparation for that
[42:10] moment I've served him since I was a 12
[42:13] year old boy I'll be 68 in a month in a
[42:15] few
[42:16] months been preaching since I was 18 and
[42:20] sometimes I don't feel like I know much
[42:21] of anything about him because he's so
[42:24] great and so wonderful
[42:27] we certainly don't want to be like the
[42:29] skit portrayed it that we don't think we
[42:32] need the advice of those men that God
[42:35] has called do we we want to take heed
[42:37] and we want to listen to it so we'll
[42:40] invite brother Andrew if you'll just
[42:41] come and you open your heart to the Lord
[42:43] and we just so appreciate you coming so
[42:46] very much
[43:01] man God bless you this evening I trust
[43:04] you all have enjoyed yourself here amen
[43:07] this has certainly been one of the
[43:11] grandest times of of our life sitting
[43:14] here around this table it it reminds us
[43:17] that this
[43:19] is this is just a preview of what we're
[43:22] getting ready
[43:23] to we're getting ready to see this is
[43:26] just maybe a little foretaste
[43:28] of of what heaven has in store for each
[43:32] and every one of us and I tell you we're
[43:34] just a we're a blessed people and uh we
[43:38] want to thank Word of Life Church here
[43:41] for allowing all of these young people
[43:43] to come and be a part of these this
[43:46] moment and time and y'all don't tell any
[43:49] anybody but I tell you don't tell
[43:52] anybody else I said this but this is the
[43:54] nicest banquet I've ever been to and uh
[43:58] it's uh it's quite well done and I I I
[44:01] know that you understand that so before
[44:04] we just kind of get to our thought here
[44:06] tonight and look over some things that
[44:08] the Lord has placed on our heart for
[44:10] this evening I wonder how many would
[44:12] have a need tonight that you'd like to
[44:14] just maybe lift up your hand
[44:17] and amen our Lord can come in every
[44:21] single setting many times you've met him
[44:24] in your car many times you've met him at
[44:27] at church and different places this
[44:28] might be just a little bit different
[44:30] setting here tonight but our Lord is
[44:32] wanting to come and speak to you because
[44:35] he's placed it on these brothers hearts
[44:37] and then he put a man here behind the
[44:39] pulpit to say something to you so we
[44:41] recognize that your need can already be
[44:44] met here just now so let's just take one
[44:48] another by the hand if it doesn't make
[44:50] you
[44:52] feel
[44:55] awkward anden may we just talk to the
[44:58] Lord just now Heavenly Father we come
[45:01] before you Lord in this time lord it's
[45:03] our privilege Lord Jesus Lord to sit
[45:06] around this table with brothers and
[45:08] sisters Lord that we believe that we're
[45:09] going to spend the rest of our life with
[45:12] Lord eternity will only tell father who
[45:15] is sitting right beside us what it meant
[45:18] for us to go through a journey with them
[45:21] knowing father Lord Jesus that you set
[45:24] up these things in our mind Lord you set
[45:26] up these things Lord that we're just
[45:28] thinking about how we're going to do our
[45:30] hair and how what kind of dress that
[45:32] we're going to wear but father before
[45:34] time you saw each and every one of us
[45:36] sitting at our table Lord but God I'm so
[45:39] thankful to know that there has been a
[45:41] reservation father for every one of your
[45:43] children Lord to sit around the
[45:45] banqueting table father and I pray Lord
[45:48] tonight that you would just begin to
[45:50] speak to your children Lord you see
[45:52] their needs you see their hearts and I
[45:54] pray that this service tonight will be a
[45:57] blessing to them in the name of Jesus
[46:00] Christ amen amen and now I know that
[46:03] many of you don't have your Bibles but I
[46:05] I would like for you to stand with me
[46:07] just to honor the word of the Lord as we
[46:10] just take a little thought here this
[46:13] evening the Bible says here in Esther
[46:17] chapter
[46:19] 2 after these things when the wrath of
[46:22] King aerus was appeased he remember vasy
[46:27] and what she had done and what was
[46:29] decreed against her then said the king's
[46:32] servant that ministered unto him let
[46:35] there be fair young virgins sought for
[46:37] the king and let the king appoint
[46:39] officers in all the provinces of his
[46:42] kingdom that they may gather together
[46:45] all the fair young virgins under the
[46:47] Shuan and the palace under the house of
[46:49] the women under the custody of hegi the
[46:53] king's Chamberlain Keeper of the women
[46:55] and let their things of purif ification
[46:57] be given them let the hidden or let the
[47:00] maiden which pleaseth the king be Queen
[47:04] instead of aasta and the king and the
[47:07] thing pleased the king and he did so
[47:10] also the Bible says here in Hebrews
[47:13] chapter 10 and verse 5 wherefore when he
[47:16] cometh into this world he saith
[47:19] sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not
[47:22] but a body thou Hast prepared me you may
[47:25] be seated here in the presence of the
[47:27] Lord I would like to take a thought here
[47:30] this evening on something that the
[47:32] Lord's been dealing with me on for quite
[47:34] some time about these meetings I would
[47:37] like to take a thought here tonight on
[47:39] destined for the crown destined for the
[47:43] crown and brother brandham said in the
[47:45] Ephesian Church age he said the True
[47:46] Church of Jesus Christ the bride is
[47:50] liken to pure gold her righteousness is
[47:53] his righteousness her attributes are his
[47:56] own glorious attributes her identity is
[47:59] found in him what he is she is to
[48:04] reflect and what he has she is to
[48:07] manifest there is no fault in her she is
[48:10] all glorious within and without from
[48:13] beginning to ending she is the work of
[48:16] her Lord and all her works are perfect
[48:19] in fact in her is summed up and
[48:22] manifested the Eternal wisdom and
[48:24] purpose of God how can one a it how can
[48:28] one understand it though we cannot do
[48:30] that we can accept it by faith for God
[48:34] has spoken it just to kind of place it
[48:37] in view as it's been done so wonderfully
[48:39] here tonight this skit that was put on
[48:43] we recognized just to set a a a basis
[48:45] here for this thought here tonight we
[48:47] recognize that the king had made a feast
[48:50] just like this one the king had showed
[48:52] all of his riches for many many days
[48:55] unto the Kings and the princes of the
[48:57] land and there were special Arrangements
[48:59] that was made and then the king called
[49:01] for a feast of all the people of the
[49:03] land and there all the accommodations
[49:07] that were made and set and all the
[49:09] things were made for the vast crowd that
[49:11] was going to come we're sitting here I
[49:14] understand that it's about 190 to close
[49:16] to 200 young people sitting here but in
[49:19] that time when King aerus was sitting in
[49:21] his condition or in his place of
[49:23] position he was sitting there and it is
[49:25] told in history that Persian kings when
[49:28] they would when they would hold a feast
[49:30] of this matter it would hold anywhere
[49:32] from 15,000 to 18,000 people at one time
[49:36] no and and it would be held in the
[49:38] garden because there would be huge
[49:40] amounts of people and all the
[49:42] accommodations were made and all of the
[49:44] things were made according to the things
[49:47] of how the king liked it exactly to the
[49:50] way the king stated in his decrees and
[49:53] how he wanted things and when the people
[49:55] would come in they would sit there and
[49:58] they would sit around and they would be
[49:59] dazzled by The Columns of marble they
[50:02] would look at the King's favorite colors
[50:04] of blue green and white of tapestries
[50:07] that would hold hold the curtains and
[50:09] things and they would be sitting in a
[50:12] place or a condition and all of it was
[50:14] to match the king's kingship all of it
[50:18] was in place there was anything there
[50:21] was nothing that was lacking kind of
[50:23] like what we see here tonight the
[50:25] couches that were laid out for men to
[50:27] rest upon they were made of gold these
[50:30] these people that were sitting there
[50:32] that were from the different provinces
[50:34] they were taking of the best of the best
[50:36] of the wine that the king had stored up
[50:38] only for himself but the king did not
[50:41] hold any of the stimulation back he gave
[50:43] it to the people according to his will
[50:47] and we recognize that on the seventh day
[50:49] is when he made a call for the queen and
[50:52] then vasty did not come unto the king
[50:55] but we recognize that there was a call
[50:58] for somebody to come and to take the
[51:00] crown somebody to step into the place
[51:03] now the Bible said in Proverbs 31 and10
[51:06] who can find a virtuous woman for her
[51:10] price is far above rubies the heart of
[51:13] her husband do safely trust in her so
[51:16] that he shall have no need of spoil she
[51:20] will do him good and not evil all the
[51:23] days of her life now I know that many of
[51:27] you sitting here from all the way from
[51:29] 15 years old and upwards but one of the
[51:31] greatest treasures that you can have in
[51:33] life that you'll find is a helpmate and
[51:36] any man that has been married for quite
[51:38] some time he knows the difference
[51:40] between a good wife and the opposite but
[51:43] one of the greatest things that God can
[51:45] give you is a lovely wife or a helpmate
[51:49] or somebody that is faithful somebody
[51:51] that is true somebody that is honest
[51:52] somebody that's that is Honorable that
[51:54] is trustworthy and somebody that that
[51:57] has a love towards you no matter whether
[51:59] it's male or female that their love it
[52:01] it passes Beyond barriers it looks
[52:04] beyond faults that her love knows no
[52:07] distance her love knows no bounds her
[52:09] love is patient her love is kind her
[52:11] love is passionate she is a woman if you
[52:15] if you are really seeking for a woman or
[52:17] a man you are wanting somebody that
[52:19] fears the Lord somebody that's got the
[52:22] kind of love that ask actually has the
[52:25] attributes of almighty God God that has
[52:27] been deposited in that other vessel that
[52:29] you're looking for that other one that
[52:32] that woman that he is looking for will
[52:34] have the kind of words like Ruth would
[52:37] say unto Naomi when orpa would kiss her
[52:40] on the cheeks and turn back to the back
[52:43] to the moabitas gods she Ruth would look
[52:46] onto her Naomi and said andreat me not
[52:48] to turn away as well for where you go I
[52:52] will go where you Lodge I will Lodge
[52:55] your people will be my people where you
[52:57] live I will live where you die I will
[53:00] die where you're buried that's where
[53:01] I'll be buried at and that's the kind of
[53:04] love that God is wanting to find in
[53:07] somebody that is that is fit to wear the
[53:09] crown in his position and in his place
[53:12] that he has set aside and we recognize
[53:15] that all the way back as you look and
[53:17] you look at the drama of God's of God's
[53:19] Great drama that he laid out for us we
[53:22] read it in the word that God had longed
[53:25] for a helpmate God had longed for a
[53:27] counterpart that we see all the way
[53:30] there in the garden of the Eden that God
[53:32] seen Adam that he was in a place where
[53:35] Adam had all the animals he had
[53:37] everything that could accommodate him in
[53:39] the natural but yet there was something
[53:41] on the inside of Adam that was lacking
[53:44] and it was something on Adam that he was
[53:46] he was lonely for a helpmate so God
[53:49] caused a deep sleep to come upon Adam
[53:52] and there out of the sight of Adam God
[53:55] pulled a very part of himself out and he
[53:58] brought forth Eve which Adam would call
[54:02] a woman for she is bone of my bone and
[54:05] she is Flesh of My Flesh and ever since
[54:08] the Garden of Eden when do you watch how
[54:10] that she walked out how that Adam and
[54:12] Eve walked and they broke the trust that
[54:15] God had imparted unto them almighty God
[54:18] has been waiting for centuries he's been
[54:21] building a church that he could have
[54:23] that Holy Union with again somebody that
[54:26] would love him in sickness or in health
[54:29] in Pros in prosperity and in good times
[54:32] and in bad times God has been longing
[54:35] for somebody that he could have
[54:37] fellowship with somebody that would not
[54:39] be deceived by the things of the world
[54:42] somebody that would would fully give
[54:44] over to his complete power brother
[54:48] Brandon would say it like this in a
[54:49] church age book he said now Jesus Christ
[54:52] is choosing his own bride he said just
[54:55] as the saint as men choose their Brides
[54:57] today he said the bride today does not
[55:00] simply decide she's going to take a
[55:02] certain man for a husband no sir he said
[55:04] it's the groom who decides and chooses a
[55:06] certain woman for his bride for we know
[55:08] that the Bible said that you didn't
[55:10] choose me you've not chosen me but I
[55:13] have chosen you and brother Ram goes on
[55:15] to say he said the heart purpose of God
[55:18] the heart purpose and the Eternal
[55:20] purpose of God was to take a bride of
[55:23] his own choosing he did not Choose You
[55:26] because of who you are or your last name
[55:28] he did not Choose You Because of You
[55:30] Came because of a out of a certain
[55:32] church or out of a certain group he
[55:34] chose you because you were in his mind
[55:37] before the foundation of the world and
[55:39] that is exactly what the message of the
[55:41] hour has done for you in this hour it
[55:44] has taken you and it has placed you in a
[55:47] position that God has been longing for
[55:50] for 6,000 years that we know of in time
[55:53] that God has been longing for a place
[55:55] that there is a place beside our King
[55:58] that is want that he's wanting to be
[56:00] filled and that's exactly what the
[56:02] message of the hour has done for you it
[56:04] has bled you back into a spot that we
[56:08] recognize that we are not a broken bride
[56:11] but we are a restored bride a woman that
[56:14] has knows Fellowship by relationship by
[56:18] predestination a woman that understands
[56:21] the assembling of herself together by
[56:23] The Fellowship of the word of God
[56:27] this God that chose you thought of you
[56:31] before you were ever born here and
[56:34] before you ever fail and before you ever
[56:36] had mistakes this God chose you he
[56:39] elected you you had certain places that
[56:42] you were destined to set here tonight
[56:44] and maybe you didn't get to choose
[56:46] exactly where you or who you wanted to
[56:48] set beside but there was somebody that
[56:50] picked out a spot for you aren't you
[56:53] thankful that you didn't have to pick
[56:54] out your own spot in God's mind that
[56:57] almighty God already picked out a spot
[57:00] for you because if you would have picked
[57:01] your own spot you'd have been out in
[57:03] misery already you'd have already been
[57:05] in TMO but almighty God picked a spot
[57:08] for you and to know this tonight that
[57:11] your circumstances of Life do not change
[57:13] your calling no matter where you are no
[57:16] matter where you came from it does not
[57:18] change your calling remember before
[57:21] Esther was ever to be putting on the
[57:23] crown she was an orphan but when by the
[57:26] end of Esther's story she is not going
[57:28] to be known as an orphan no longer she's
[57:31] going to be known as a queen and when
[57:33] God gets done with you you might have
[57:35] mistakes upon your life you might have
[57:37] troubles upon your life but your story
[57:40] is not going to be troubles your story
[57:43] is not going to be the stories that were
[57:45] written in Le osia but your story is
[57:47] going to be known as the title as Miss
[57:50] Jesus Christ a lady that was so destined
[57:54] to look the part to dress apart somebody
[57:58] that would be fitting to the kingdom
[58:01] when you go to studying out Esther's
[58:02] name her name means star somebody that
[58:06] would rise somebody that that's what we
[58:08] see is a star that would rise and that's
[58:11] what we watched in this generation when
[58:13] God would take a star in this generation
[58:16] and hold it in his hands he was waiting
[58:19] for a certain time to release the
[58:21] seventh star in this generation because
[58:24] he has a certain time that he's going to
[58:25] release release a star because he knows
[58:28] he knows that that star is going to call
[58:30] and it's going to attract a certain
[58:32] people and when he allowed Esther to
[58:34] rise in her position it was only for
[58:37] King Xerxes or aerus that he was going
[58:40] she was fit for him she was destined to
[58:43] match up with his kingship and when God
[58:46] allowed William Bram the Seven Star to
[58:48] be released in this generation he
[58:51] recognized he recognized that it was
[58:53] going to attract a certain people that
[58:55] way have the characteristics that would
[58:58] be called and chosen in this generation
[59:01] that would match him for this hour
[59:04] because he he could not release Luther
[59:06] star in this generation because it
[59:09] wouldn't match your testimony he
[59:11] couldn't lose Wesley star in this
[59:13] generation because it wouldn't match
[59:15] your testimony but the morning star and
[59:18] the evening star are only reflecting of
[59:21] a greater light and we recognize by the
[59:24] message that the same star that rises in
[59:26] the morning is the same star that we see
[59:29] in the evening it's just rolled itself
[59:31] around so it's a sign unto us that there
[59:34] is going to be an alpha bride and there
[59:36] is an Omega bride that will stand in
[59:39] this generation and we recognize that
[59:41] you didn't get here on your own course
[59:44] you didn't choose your own way there was
[59:46] somebody that led you there was somebody
[59:48] that called you there was somebody that
[59:50] destined before you something there's a
[59:53] course that is set before you you may
[59:55] have picked out your career you may have
[59:57] picked out certain things of your life
[59:59] but we know that the Bible tells us or
[1:00:01] Jesus tells us that the that God that he
[1:00:04] would be a God he would be he would be
[1:00:06] the spirit of Truth and he would be our
[1:00:08] comforter and he would lead us he would
[1:00:11] guide us so no matter what or where you
[1:00:13] come from your circumstances of Life
[1:00:16] he's always been there all the days of
[1:00:18] your life watching over
[1:00:21] you one of my favorite quotes that
[1:00:24] William Brandon makes a statement t i I
[1:00:26] believe that I believe that it's
[1:00:27] probably even some of yours that if
[1:00:29] you've studied the message he says in
[1:00:31] the God who is rich in Mercy he said now
[1:00:33] many of you can fellowship with me on
[1:00:35] this thought he said because he said
[1:00:37] when you was a child he said there was
[1:00:40] something he said he said there was
[1:00:41] something there he said it didn't he
[1:00:43] said maybe it didn't bother maybe this
[1:00:45] one or that one he said but something on
[1:00:48] the inside of you it cried out he said
[1:00:50] it was that little germ of life right
[1:00:53] there and then it was something on the
[1:00:55] inside of you that maybe maybe you
[1:00:57] didn't know maybe you didn't know what
[1:00:58] was calling you maybe you didn't know
[1:01:01] why you didn't go and try to build up
[1:01:04] certain characteristics of working out
[1:01:06] your arm so that you could arm wrestler
[1:01:08] The King's
[1:01:09] chamber it maybe it wasn't certain
[1:01:12] things that maybe you built up in your
[1:01:14] life but there was something there that
[1:01:16] the rest of the world didn't know but
[1:01:18] there was something there that was
[1:01:19] keeping you all the days of your life
[1:01:22] when the rest of the world could go out
[1:01:24] and be a part of the enticement and
[1:01:26] spirits of the generation you couldn't
[1:01:28] go after them things because there was a
[1:01:30] greater calling on your life and when
[1:01:33] other people would pick it up you would
[1:01:35] put it down and the reason of this is
[1:01:38] because you're not a
[1:01:40] vasy I want to say this to you tonight
[1:01:44] vasy will never be an Esther but Esther
[1:01:47] will never be a
[1:01:50] vasty there will be a lot of people that
[1:01:52] think they're called to this wedding
[1:01:54] supper but there's only only one
[1:01:56] generation there's only one person that
[1:01:58] is set there that is set for that por
[1:02:01] that portion of scripture that is laying
[1:02:03] there the Bible said in Proverbs 12:4 a
[1:02:07] virtuous woman is a crown to her
[1:02:10] husband but she that maketh the shamed
[1:02:13] is his rottenness in his bones so I know
[1:02:17] which one you would choose is that
[1:02:20] right I know that probably none of y'all
[1:02:22] have this on your mind you're probably
[1:02:24] not here to think about you're probably
[1:02:27] only here for the word you probably
[1:02:29] didn't come here to meet a significant
[1:02:34] other I'm not as dumb as I think as I
[1:02:36] look
[1:02:38] I but there's
[1:02:42] something I
[1:02:44] know but there's something on the inside
[1:02:46] of you that that maybe when you when you
[1:02:48] found that
[1:02:49] want that it begin to it begin to
[1:02:53] Sparkle a little something in your eye
[1:02:56] brother brandom would talk about Esther
[1:02:58] how that how that she'd walked out how
[1:03:01] that her beautiful hair and he said her
[1:03:04] eyes he would talk about Eve and he
[1:03:07] would talk about how that her how that
[1:03:08] her eyes were as beautiful as the sky
[1:03:12] and any of you that have found that
[1:03:14] significant
[1:03:16] one you know what it it's a good pickup
[1:03:19] line if you don't know
[1:03:22] it your daddy must be a thief cuz he
[1:03:25] stole the stars from the sky and put
[1:03:27] them in your
[1:03:30] eyes but the first thing let me move let
[1:03:33] me move I didn't come here for pickup
[1:03:35] lines but see me after church you're the
[1:03:38] only 10 I see
[1:03:41] so but if you're
[1:03:46] going but if you found that
[1:03:48] one the first one the first thing
[1:03:51] brother Brandon would tell us the first
[1:03:52] thing that comes is a
[1:03:54] decision the next is the engagement then
[1:03:57] the promise and then the
[1:03:59] ceremony he goes he says this he says
[1:04:02] she takes the bridegroom's name and when
[1:04:05] the church has the ceremony and makes
[1:04:08] their promises then she takes the
[1:04:09] bridegroom's name that she's no longer a
[1:04:12] church of the world she is the Church of
[1:04:14] the Lord Jesus Christ he said not by
[1:04:17] name he said but by birth by Nature
[1:04:20] power of God revealed to the church in
[1:04:23] her in the heart she becomes a a
[1:04:25] Christian church and we recognize that
[1:04:28] there has been a preview in the bride
[1:04:30] when all the other maidens would come
[1:04:32] before him but when it became Esther's
[1:04:34] turn she didn't want the things of the
[1:04:37] world she wanted only what the king
[1:04:39] desired and I believe that that's every
[1:04:42] call and every Christian's heart that's
[1:04:44] only the thing that we want we don't
[1:04:46] want the things of Le osia we only want
[1:04:50] what pleases him if it doesn't please
[1:04:52] him I don't want it if it doesn't please
[1:04:55] him I don't want to be a part of it if
[1:04:58] it doesn't if it doesn't attract his
[1:05:00] attention we shouldn't be a part of it
[1:05:03] because God does not count how beautiful
[1:05:05] we are in the natural God counts
[1:05:07] something way deeper than things on the
[1:05:10] outside of the appearance God sits and
[1:05:13] looks for something that of character he
[1:05:16] don't count how many people are here he
[1:05:18] is looking for character something that
[1:05:21] will last when the rest of the world has
[1:05:23] passed away it's something that he saw
[1:05:26] in you before the foundation of the
[1:05:28] world and everything that you touch
[1:05:31] seems as Esther would make her way into
[1:05:33] the kingdom everything that she touched
[1:05:36] was blessed and when the king's keeper
[1:05:39] saw her he knew that there was something
[1:05:41] different about her she didn't look like
[1:05:44] vasty she didn't act like vasty and when
[1:05:47] hegy ey saw her how that she handled
[1:05:50] herself according to Malachi for's word
[1:05:53] he be to watch her and he was in intent
[1:05:56] on her success he was going to make sure
[1:06:00] he was going to make sure that the
[1:06:01] methodists in the Church of Christ did
[1:06:03] not get in front of her he was intent on
[1:06:06] her success to make sure that he
[1:06:09] whispered every secret that he knew
[1:06:11] about the king everything that elaser
[1:06:15] knew about Isaac he was beginning to
[1:06:17] tell to Rebecca and tell her this is
[1:06:20] what the king likes he likes it just
[1:06:23] like this he wants you dress like this
[1:06:25] he wants you to be robed exactly like
[1:06:28] this let me say this to you Esther
[1:06:31] submitted herself to Malachi 4's
[1:06:33] teaching she didn't pay attention to
[1:06:35] what the world said but she paid
[1:06:37] attention to what the king's Chamberlain
[1:06:40] had in mind and I believe that is a
[1:06:43] testament to who you are tonight the way
[1:06:45] that you showed up here brothers and the
[1:06:48] way that you showed up here sisters it
[1:06:50] shows in your character that you have
[1:06:53] been paying attention to HEI
[1:06:56] that there's something about you that
[1:06:59] maybe you don't even recognize about
[1:07:01] yourself just now but there's something
[1:07:03] about you that you wanted to look the
[1:07:06] part even when you didn't feel the
[1:07:11] part
[1:07:13] Hallelujah you're not just another one
[1:07:15] of the
[1:07:16] girls because you're not just destined
[1:07:19] to walk past him one
[1:07:21] time you're destined to spend eternity
[1:07:24] with him you're not just destined to
[1:07:27] come and entertain him and please him
[1:07:29] every once in a while but you're
[1:07:31] destined for the
[1:07:33] crown because he trusts your
[1:07:36] judgment because there are certain
[1:07:38] things that he did not accomplish here
[1:07:41] while he was here on Earth so he said
[1:07:44] greater things than this shall you do
[1:07:46] because I go unto my
[1:07:48] father and I will receive you unto
[1:07:51] myself so there is a work for you so he
[1:07:53] trust you and I think it's very powerful
[1:07:57] that our Lord Jesus Christ has entrusted
[1:08:00] some of the greatest youth there is on
[1:08:03] the face of the Earth he's entrusted you
[1:08:05] with his very own life he's entrusted
[1:08:08] you with his word he's entrusted you so
[1:08:11] that you'll not just display himself
[1:08:14] just at church services but you'll
[1:08:16] display him when you walk through the
[1:08:18] mall you'll display him when you go to
[1:08:20] school he has saw something about you
[1:08:24] that maybe your parents have haven't
[1:08:25] even seen in you yet but he has
[1:08:27] entrusted you with the message of the
[1:08:29] hour so that you'll carry it out
[1:08:32] according to his Commission because we
[1:08:35] know that the modern Church in its
[1:08:37] condition can never carry out its
[1:08:39] commission but it's going to be an
[1:08:41] elected lady somebody that's chosen for
[1:08:44] it somebody that's called for it you
[1:08:47] didn't put yourself here it was just a
[1:08:50] call that went out you didn't put
[1:08:52] yourself in the picture but because you
[1:08:55] were a Virgin by the blood of Jesus
[1:08:57] Christ he drawed You by his power he
[1:09:01] draw you into the kingdom to match his
[1:09:10] kingship she was a woman of
[1:09:13] character that would do
[1:09:15] only as the king
[1:09:18] pleases as you seen the other girls they
[1:09:22] wanted to dress
[1:09:24] himself the other girls wanted to paint
[1:09:27] themselves
[1:09:28] up but this lady wanted to dress
[1:09:31] herself under the Robes of Ephesian
[1:09:34] 4 she wanted to dress herself under
[1:09:37] Apostles and Prophets and teachers and
[1:09:39] pastors she wanted to dress herself
[1:09:41] according to the scripture because she
[1:09:44] had heard that she was a king that had
[1:09:47] liked certain
[1:09:48] things and when she went in before the
[1:09:52] king don't dress me the way I want to
[1:09:56] dress don't let me D be dressed with my
[1:09:59] attitude don't let me be dressed in my
[1:10:01] own righteousness don't let me be
[1:10:03] dressed with what I think the message is
[1:10:06] but let me be dressed according to the
[1:10:09] message the way he wants it to be mess
[1:10:12] how he wants it to be fitted in this
[1:10:13] hour don't let me cut off certain parts
[1:10:16] of the Gown don't let me cut off certain
[1:10:19] parts of I don't need a part of
[1:10:20] Revelations 3 and14 I don't need this
[1:10:23] over here in John 3:16 but let me be
[1:10:26] dressed according to the way that he
[1:10:29] wants me to be dressed and when you get
[1:10:32] there on Rapture morning you'll take a
[1:10:35] spin
[1:10:36] around and you'll say the dress fits
[1:10:39] me just
[1:10:43] perfect it's a beautiful thing when you
[1:10:46] begin to watch a wedding and I know
[1:10:48] there's several that's getting ready to
[1:10:50] take
[1:10:50] place but when the when the bride to be
[1:10:55] begins to try on her
[1:10:58] dress it shows her character when she
[1:11:00] picks out a dress according to the
[1:11:03] message and when she goes all the
[1:11:05] emotions are involved in it she's waited
[1:11:08] for this day ever since she was a little
[1:11:10] bitty
[1:11:11] girl she's dreamed about this she's had
[1:11:14] little Barbie dolls set out and she's
[1:11:16] had all of them at her wedding time and
[1:11:19] time again she's got poster boards on
[1:11:21] Pinterest and different things lined out
[1:11:24] this is how I'm going to to do
[1:11:26] it she's dreamed about it but when she
[1:11:30] puts the dress
[1:11:31] on she knows I'm in the final
[1:11:35] moments I'm in the spot where prophecy
[1:11:39] is becoming
[1:11:41] reality and when you come under the
[1:11:43] preaching of the word young people
[1:11:45] you're coming under it you're seeing
[1:11:47] yourself and I if I could maybe just
[1:11:50] change your view from what you see in
[1:11:53] the world just to see his
[1:11:56] you're beginning to look the
[1:11:58] part now you've dreamed about it for a
[1:12:01] long
[1:12:02] time but maybe I'll change your
[1:12:06] view because whenever I'm at a wedding a
[1:12:09] lot of people
[1:12:10] turn to see the bride but I always turn
[1:12:15] to see the groom because it's his first
[1:12:19] time seeing her dressed this
[1:12:22] way maybe I'll just change
[1:12:25] maybe your view just for a moment from
[1:12:28] the King's Point of View you're looking
[1:12:31] the
[1:12:32] part you're everything that he's wanting
[1:12:36] all you have to do is keep feeding on
[1:12:38] this message keep listening to this word
[1:12:42] don't matter don't pay no attention to
[1:12:44] the rest of the people that are sitting
[1:12:45] up there on the porch while they're
[1:12:47] criticizing making fun and thinking that
[1:12:49] he'll never come back for you don't you
[1:12:51] pay no attention to them because he made
[1:12:54] you a little he give a little no love
[1:12:56] note and he put on the he put on you a
[1:12:59] seal a kiss a seal of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:02] that it was a promise to you that I'm
[1:13:04] coming back for you with one year and
[1:13:06] the rest of the world may life at you
[1:13:08] and they might criticize you but he's
[1:13:10] promised you when the rest of the world
[1:13:13] don't understand why you're dressing
[1:13:15] yourself the way that you're dressing
[1:13:17] yourself you simply say he promised me
[1:13:20] that he was coming back for me and if he
[1:13:23] promised me that he was coming back for
[1:13:25] me I'm going to keep myself according to
[1:13:28] his word not what the rest of the world
[1:13:30] thinks but I'm going to dress myself
[1:13:33] according to the way that he wants when
[1:13:36] you begin to study out Esther and you
[1:13:38] begin to study it through the message
[1:13:39] one of the most amazing things to me is
[1:13:42] when brother Brandon begins to identify
[1:13:44] and study out Esther he identifies her
[1:13:48] with the woman with the alabaster
[1:13:52] box I look long and hard at
[1:13:56] and I thought how in the
[1:13:58] world could brother brandham identify
[1:14:01] her with this woman of disgrace a woman
[1:14:05] that had spent her
[1:14:07] life doing evil
[1:14:10] Deeds but he did not compare
[1:14:13] her to her mistakes he did not compare
[1:14:16] her to her last name he did not compare
[1:14:19] her according to her Deeds that she'
[1:14:21] done he compared her to her spirit
[1:14:27] because when this
[1:14:29] woman when she saw Jesus sitting in a
[1:14:32] seat
[1:14:35] unwelcomed she came before
[1:14:37] him with all that she
[1:14:42] had William brandom identified her that
[1:14:45] she came before him in a quiet pure Meek
[1:14:48] Spirit exactly how Esther came before
[1:14:51] The King
[1:14:57] he doesn't see your mistakes he doesn't
[1:15:01] see where you came
[1:15:02] from when the rest of the world wouldn't
[1:15:05] entertain
[1:15:06] him this woman made a
[1:15:09] choice I can't come on my own Deeds I
[1:15:12] can't come upon my own righteousness I
[1:15:14] can't came I can't come upon my own name
[1:15:17] because all those are filthy
[1:15:19] racks but I've got to come before
[1:15:22] him and when she came before him him and
[1:15:25] the scripture tells us that she came in
[1:15:27] behind him and she be to
[1:15:31] wash his feet with her
[1:15:33] tears and she begin to break the
[1:15:36] alabaster box and anoint
[1:15:40] him Simon was sitting there Judas was
[1:15:44] sitting there Peter was sitting
[1:15:46] there if he really was a prophet he
[1:15:50] wouldn't let this be done he would know
[1:15:53] what type of woman she is
[1:15:56] but with Jesus to his back to her begin
[1:15:59] to tell her story where she came from
[1:16:02] why she's here you didn't welcome me I'd
[1:16:06] say that maybe it was kind of a setup
[1:16:09] like this it was a great
[1:16:13] feast and people were talking about the
[1:16:15] politics of the day they were talking
[1:16:17] about the things of world that were
[1:16:19] going on and they missed that Jesus was
[1:16:22] setting
[1:16:25] over in a corner with 30
[1:16:27] feet and all she cared about was coming
[1:16:30] to worship
[1:16:32] him let me say when you get done washing
[1:16:36] Jesus's feet there's something going to
[1:16:38] be said about it because this woman is
[1:16:42] not going to go down like the rest of
[1:16:44] women she is going to be down she's
[1:16:47] going to go down in history as Jesus
[1:16:49] would say that wherever the gospel is
[1:16:52] preached there will be a memorial of
[1:16:54] this
[1:16:56] woman I had it in my
[1:16:59] notes who would set out a
[1:17:03] chair for the
[1:17:09] king here we
[1:17:11] have our lord Jesus sitting
[1:17:16] here we know his
[1:17:19] decision about
[1:17:23] you because he already told us I
[1:17:33] do but what's your decision
[1:17:37] today in sickness and in health will you
[1:17:40] love him will you keep
[1:17:43] him will you be a wife to him when
[1:17:45] nobody else wants to be a wife to him
[1:17:48] will you love him and cherish
[1:17:52] him would you allow him to come and sit
[1:17:56] down at your table and be the Unseen
[1:17:59] guest if you allow him and set out a
[1:18:02] seat for him you won't be remembered as
[1:18:06] an orphan no
[1:18:08] more you'll be remembered as a
[1:18:12] queen and if you can ever learn
[1:18:16] this that when Jesus came to meet this
[1:18:19] woman when he had his back turned to her
[1:18:23] and she he began to preach to Simon said
[1:18:27] Simon I left a healing campaign out
[1:18:31] there I left lepers out there I left
[1:18:33] blind people out there but because you
[1:18:36] invited me I
[1:18:38] came but you didn't wash my feet you
[1:18:41] didn't anoint me but this woman ever
[1:18:44] since I got into the room she's had
[1:18:47] something on her heart that she would
[1:18:49] worship me all the days of her life when
[1:18:52] others people wouldn't worship me
[1:18:55] if you can ever figure out young people
[1:18:57] that the reason why Jesus is in the room
[1:19:00] is because of you you'll start living a
[1:19:03] whole completely different life that the
[1:19:05] reason why he showed up in these
[1:19:07] meetings is because of you he didn't
[1:19:10] show up here because of Andrew Spencer
[1:19:12] or brother Josh Bennett he did not show
[1:19:14] up here just because of brother brother
[1:19:16] Reagan and all of these other brothers
[1:19:18] he showed up here for you and I believe
[1:19:21] it ought to be a testament to you of
[1:19:23] where you're sitting at in your
[1:19:25] condition right now that he cared so
[1:19:28] much about you to come all the way from
[1:19:30] the portals of glory and to come and
[1:19:32] spend the evening with
[1:19:34] you that to tell you you're not destined
[1:19:38] to be in the
[1:19:40] background he might have found you in
[1:19:42] the
[1:19:43] background and you might be back there
[1:19:45] washing the dishes and you might be back
[1:19:47] there on the scene when when the rest of
[1:19:49] the world is in the front of the view
[1:19:52] but there on the backside when you're
[1:19:55] throwing out the dishwater that's when
[1:19:57] he sees your true
[1:20:00] character and when you're trying to hide
[1:20:03] that you don't have the nicest of
[1:20:05] things it's exactly what he's looking
[1:20:09] for IID say that the Bride of Jesus
[1:20:12] Christ has
[1:20:15] everything that our King is looking
[1:20:19] for and when you get to your position
[1:20:24] you'll m his kingship and his
[1:20:28] queenship I
[1:20:30] believe I believe that we have great
[1:20:34] anticipation I believe we have great
[1:20:36] anticipation one of I'm not a very I'm
[1:20:39] not a very old man I'm getting that way
[1:20:42] don't stand too close to me because my
[1:20:43] red hair is looking more like a cinnamon
[1:20:46] bun than than red
[1:20:51] hair I'm not too old of a man
[1:20:56] but I I do wake up
[1:20:58] with stupid ball injuries every once in
[1:21:02] a while I wish I wouldn't have done
[1:21:05] acted like a Superman all those
[1:21:09] times so I'm giving you a word don't
[1:21:11] don't act too crazy tomorrow but enjoy
[1:21:15] yourself I'll be watching
[1:21:17] you I'm not too old of a man just yet
[1:21:21] but there's something on the inside of
[1:21:24] me
[1:21:25] that longs for a
[1:21:27] change everything within me I enjoy all
[1:21:31] these moments I enjoy all these meetings
[1:21:34] and I enjoy the presence of the
[1:21:36] Lord more than anything else in this
[1:21:41] world when you get into that place in
[1:21:43] that position where you're spending
[1:21:45] spending that much time with him that
[1:21:47] you can feel him in the room and you
[1:21:50] don't want him to
[1:21:52] leave you're in a position that a queen
[1:21:55] has been elevated to that the rest of
[1:21:58] the world don't know what it's
[1:22:01] like and I hate leaving his presence but
[1:22:05] I am anticipating more than anything
[1:22:07] else is
[1:22:09] coming but can you imagine his
[1:22:14] anticipation as he looks out upon your
[1:22:16] life and he sees you
[1:22:19] matching his
[1:22:21] promise he say I'm coming soon
[1:22:25] I promised you I was coming I told you I
[1:22:28] was
[1:22:29] coming mother brandham said he could
[1:22:31] hear that buck wagon coming down the
[1:22:35] street as the sand was rolling
[1:22:37] underneath the
[1:22:39] wheels and it was the last day and she
[1:22:41] began to dress herself she put on her
[1:22:44] garments brother brandham said that here
[1:22:47] she was the bride to be was
[1:22:50] holding her flower of bouquet in her
[1:22:53] hand he said without a bit of
[1:22:56] nervousness because she knew he was
[1:23:00] coming I love what brother random said
[1:23:03] he said when she saw that buck wagon
[1:23:05] turn the
[1:23:06] corner she jumped off the
[1:23:09] porch and he jumped off the Chariot and
[1:23:13] stepped in and swooped her up and told
[1:23:14] her and said honey it's all
[1:23:19] over you're destined for a
[1:23:22] crown so Carrie
[1:23:24] yourself like he sees you as a
[1:23:29] queen may God bless his word maybe we'll
[1:23:33] just have a word of prayer turn it back

[1:24:44] themselves

[1:26:02] can we stand
[1:26:04] [Music]
[1:26:06] together thank you brother Andre so
[1:26:09] appreciate the word
[1:26:11] tonight I saw yesterday that in the
[1:26:16] state of
[1:26:17] Utah several parents had come to a a
[1:26:21] middle
[1:26:22] school because the some of the students
[1:26:26] in that school consider thems
[1:26:30] furries so some of them think they are
[1:26:33] dogs cats
[1:26:36] raccoons all kinds of
[1:26:38] animals so they're biting other students
[1:26:42] in school licking them with their
[1:26:46] tongue and I read that and I thought
[1:26:50] what a sad time to be
[1:26:52] living to we kids
[1:26:55] think that they're
[1:26:56] animals a school teacher in the message
[1:26:59] a while back told me in State North
[1:27:01] Carolina that they're actually putting
[1:27:03] out litter boxes for students in the
[1:27:07] schools because they think they're
[1:27:10] animals and yet you you've come
[1:27:13] tonight to be in the presence of
[1:27:17] God I pray that God will help us to
[1:27:20] realize how blessed we are what a
[1:27:23] terrible time
[1:27:24] men don't know if they're men anymore
[1:27:26] women don't know if they're women
[1:27:28] anymore while the world is groping in
[1:27:31] insanity but God has a bride that
[1:27:35] recognizes who she is and what she's
[1:27:38] here for and it's to serve his
[1:27:41] purpose we've been so honored that you

[1:31:42] you oh God I I pray Lord that I'd be a
