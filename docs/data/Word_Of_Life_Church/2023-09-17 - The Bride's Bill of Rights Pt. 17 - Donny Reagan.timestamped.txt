[39:12] mercy to him
[39:13] also Lord God we're asking you for
[39:16] brother Louie's brother brother Bob
[39:17] they're in the hospital and they've done
[39:19] several tests on him and still can't
[39:21] figure out exactly what's going on with
[39:23] him but I'll send you a word today in
[39:26] the name of Jesus May the spirit of God
[39:29] touch him Lord bring him out of that
[39:31] hospital dear God make him well speak to
[39:34] every heart today we ask in the name of
[39:37] the Lord Jesus
[39:39] amen
[39:40] praise the Lord
[39:42] admit an awesome opportunity to be a
[39:45] Christian today
[39:46] to be able to live for the Lord Jesus
[39:49] and this hour of terrible darkness and
[39:52] so much is coming upon the human race
[39:54] and people don't know what to do they
[39:57] don't know which way to turn they don't
[39:58] know which way to look would be the same
[40:01] way if it wasn't for the grace of God
[40:03] we're so grateful for him today remember
[40:06] September 23rd and 24th which will be
[40:09] Saturday night and Sunday morning
[40:11] brother Tim Burdette and his church will
[40:13] be with us and we're looking forward to
[40:16] that turn with me if you would today to
[40:18] the Book of Romans chapter 8 verse 35.
[40:22] how many would like to find out a little
[40:24] bit more about your Bill of Rights today
[40:26] as a believer
[40:28] I'm so grateful that God has given to us
[40:31] as his people
[40:32] so many wonderful things
[40:35] as I study on this and I think well I
[40:37] guess I'm just about done with it but
[40:39] until I find a whole lot more in that I
[40:41] realize I'm not sure you can ever get
[40:43] done with something like this it's so
[40:44] wonderful what is redeemed us from and
[40:48] redeemed us too and the Redemption has
[40:49] two parts going out of and going into
[40:52] many people came out of the world but
[40:55] they never really went into Christ all
[40:57] the way so that's what we desire to do
[41:00] today by his health listen to this
[41:02] profound scripture in Romans chapter 8
[41:05] Paul of course we know had an
[41:08] understanding unlike any of the rest of
[41:10] the New Testament writers God had called
[41:13] him with a special insight into his word
[41:16] and even Peter wrote about Paul and he
[41:20] said that our beloved brother Paul which
[41:22] writes many things which are hard to be
[41:26] understood and he said that people twist
[41:29] them or rest wrest which was twist as
[41:33] they do the other scriptures so can you
[41:36] imagine that the Apostle Peter was was
[41:38] with the Lord Jesus personally but he
[41:41] recognized there was something in Paul
[41:43] unlike any of the rest of the brothers
[41:45] had and actually called Paul's writings
[41:49] the scriptures
[41:51] that's awesome then
[41:53] so listen to these scriptures today
[41:56] who
[41:58] shall separate us
[42:01] from the love of Christ
[42:04] look at the word separate
[42:07] put asunder
[42:09] divide
[42:11] part
[42:12] to depart
[42:14] to leave a husband or wife
[42:18] of of divorce so who shall separate us
[42:22] from the love of Christ now that's a
[42:26] question how many knows the answer
[42:28] nothing
[42:30] nobody
[42:31] nothing
[42:33] who shall separate us from the love of
[42:36] Christ now he's going to mention some
[42:38] things here I find it odd in the way
[42:40] that he says it because he says who
[42:43] then he identifies Watts
[42:47] notice he doesn't mention any person's
[42:49] name or any Demon's name but what he
[42:54] identifies is who shall separate us from
[42:56] the love of Christ shall tribulation
[42:59] I thought he said who
[43:02] tribulation is that a person
[43:05] tribulation
[43:07] which means look at the Greek word
[43:09] philipsis affliction
[43:11] trouble
[43:13] anguish
[43:15] burdened
[43:16] oppressing and make him relate to
[43:19] tribulation
[43:20] oppressing oppressing together
[43:24] oppression
[43:26] Affliction distress
[43:31] now listen to this who shall separate us
[43:33] from the love of Christ shall
[43:35] tribulation or distress or persecution
[43:39] or famine or nakedness or peril or sword
[43:46] as it is written for thy sake we are
[43:50] killed
[43:51] wow this certainly doesn't sound like
[43:53] the Christianity that's preached today
[43:56] the Christianity that's preached today
[43:57] as everything's going to go easy you you
[44:00] come from the devil and come from the
[44:02] world and first thing you get to Fleet
[44:04] of Cadillacs or whatever more
[44:07] everything's so easy that's not Bible
[44:09] Christianity
[44:11] and the church said
[44:13] as it is written for thy sake we are
[44:16] killed all the day long so not just once
[44:20] I mean do it once and get me out of this
[44:22] misery we're killed all the day long
[44:25] absolutely all the day long for the
[44:28] cause of the Lord Jesus we are accounted
[44:32] as sheep
[44:34] for the slaughter
[44:35] nay in all these things
[44:39] we are going to try our best
[44:42] to be able to hold on and maybe we will
[44:46] be able to survive at least one out of
[44:49] ten thousand we are more
[44:54] than conquerors through feelings through
[44:58] emotion through shouting we believe in
[45:01] all of that but this is not the way we
[45:04] conquer we are more than conquerors
[45:07] through him
[45:10] that loved us
[45:12] for I am persuaded that neither deaths
[45:17] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[45:22] nor powers nor things present nor things
[45:27] to come nor Heights nor depths nor any
[45:32] other creature now Paul said just in
[45:36] case I left anything out let me blanket
[45:39] coverage everything from this point on
[45:42] any other creature shall be able to
[45:46] separate us from the love of God which
[45:50] is in Christ Jesus our lord
[45:54] well I'll tell you what that's enough
[45:56] word we could just say the benediction
[45:58] and go home and say it's been good to be
[46:00] in the house of God
[46:01] but let's comment on it a little bit
[46:03] before we go what do you say and the
[46:06] believer said to the word
[46:07] amen God bless you you may be seated so
[46:11] from this let me take another one of
[46:14] your blessed wonderful inalienable
[46:17] rights that are given to you as the
[46:21] Believers in the gospel of the Lord
[46:23] Jesus it is a right that you are
[46:27] inseparable from God's program now all
[46:31] of us I'm sure have had friends and we
[46:35] were so close to them even maybe family
[46:38] members and maybe some of you are
[46:39] sitting here today and you find yourself
[46:42] estranged as we call it from a family
[46:45] member maybe it's a brother maybe it's a
[46:47] father a mother a grandfather a sister a
[46:50] man aunt or an uncle and you at one time
[46:53] were so close and something came between
[46:56] you a little simple misunderstanding
[46:58] maybe it was something about money maybe
[47:00] it was a disagreement about this and
[47:03] that and that person that you felt so
[47:06] close to and they loved you so much and
[47:09] you love them so much and today you all
[47:12] don't even speak and today you find
[47:14] yourself when you think about that
[47:17] person you find yourself feeling a very
[47:20] unusual feeling about them it's it's an
[47:23] estranged feeling that you don't feel
[47:26] the same way you did before and if you
[47:28] truly love that individual I'm sure that
[47:31] you feel sort of sad because you
[47:33] reminisce of the good times you had
[47:36] together and you think of the days you
[47:38] spent together in family gatherings and
[47:40] you think of the things that you talked
[47:43] about and the fellowship that you had oh
[47:45] but it's been six months maybe a year
[47:48] maybe it's five and you sought your by
[47:51] your bind was together was so
[47:53] Inseparable but some little something
[47:56] come between you and now you don't even
[47:59] call you don't text you have no contact
[48:02] whatsoever because for the last how many
[48:05] ever times that you tried to reconcile
[48:07] that that individual it wound up being
[48:10] in an argument and things was worse than
[48:12] they were before he ever tried to fix it
[48:14] and then finally you say you know what I
[48:17] just don't know what else to do but
[48:19] maybe I just need to pull away from my
[48:22] uncle from my aunt from my cousin and
[48:24] just pray that God will work this thing
[48:27] out but no doubt if you really love that
[48:30] individual you don't feel the same in
[48:33] your heart that you did before now what
[48:35] is that that's because something has
[48:38] separated something that was strong now
[48:42] had it not been for the determinant
[48:44] Council of almighty God there would
[48:47] every one of us that are saved and since
[48:50] the cross down through time Satan would
[48:53] have found out a way to most likely
[48:56] separate every one of us from the love
[48:59] of God had it been based on our
[49:02] faithfulness had it been based on our
[49:04] durability had it been based on our pace
[49:07] patients and our faith and so on and so
[49:10] on anything that you base on human
[49:13] beings it's very shaky anything that you
[49:17] base on human beings it's questionable
[49:20] and more than likely there will be a
[49:22] failure now don't misunderstand me when
[49:24] I say it this way there is no preacher
[49:27] there is no human being that I put my
[49:31] ultimate confidence in because they will
[49:34] let you down there is one that I put my
[49:38] ultimate confidence in and I know he
[49:41] will never disappoint me and that's the
[49:43] Lord Jesus now I've had really good
[49:46] close preacher friends and and then we
[49:48] get into a little difference of opinion
[49:50] about a certain Doctrine or something
[49:52] you know whatever it would be and you
[49:54] try to reconcile and you go to sharing
[49:57] quotes and sharing scriptures and then
[49:59] you'll come to a spot where you talk
[50:01] about it and then you try to reconcile
[50:04] with that brother and then you realize
[50:05] you know what we just don't agree on
[50:07] this and seem like every time we talk
[50:09] about it we get further and further
[50:11] apart so I think we're just going to
[50:13] have to let it be but yeah it you don't
[50:15] feel quite the same way because if
[50:18] anyone mentioned that individual's name
[50:20] and in your heart you'd say oh my I I
[50:23] wish that wasn't there between us I wish
[50:25] that wasn't there but God knew that us
[50:29] as humans were totally
[50:31] unreliable to be able to be dependent on
[50:34] to enter into an Everlasting Covenant
[50:38] and are fully us fully keep our part
[50:41] it's totally impossible Moses could not
[50:44] keep his Covenant with God Adam could
[50:47] not keep his Abraham could not keep his
[50:51] there has never been one Covenant that
[50:53] God ever made with man outside of his
[50:57] unconditional Covenant by the Lord Jesus
[51:00] that was ever kept the Torah the mishnah
[51:03] all the great Commandments that God gave
[51:06] to the children of Israel and the there
[51:08] was none of them that ever kept them no
[51:10] as God gave the levitical order and the
[51:13] priesthood and the levitical sacrifices
[51:16] and all that they did and there was
[51:18] never one person that ever kept the
[51:20] levitical order that could ever keep
[51:22] God's covenant without a fault and a
[51:25] failure and the Lord knows even under
[51:28] grace if God did not make this Covenant
[51:32] to where it was totally dependent upon
[51:36] himself and not dependent upon us that
[51:39] wouldn't be a one of us here that's even
[51:41] be saved
[51:43] well come on somebody because every one
[51:46] of us have fallen short I mean it's
[51:48] fallen short of the glory of God
[51:50] how many has made mistakes how many
[51:53] still has to repent Lord I'm sorry so
[51:56] what if God would have made a covenant
[51:58] with you now I will do this and this and
[52:00] this and this as long as you obey every
[52:03] word and as soon as you break one of my
[52:07] Commandments then I break my Covenant
[52:10] and it's finished with you and I and I
[52:13] will never again make another Covenant
[52:15] with you well I can tell you the first
[52:18] one in this assembly today that would
[52:20] have been disqualified it would have
[52:22] been the preacher because I have made
[52:24] countless of mistakes and as bad as I
[52:27] hate to say it I'll probably make a
[52:29] bunch more and I'll go ahead and say it
[52:32] for you more than likely every one of
[52:34] you are going to make them two the only
[52:37] way I figure that none of us will ever
[52:40] make any more mistakes is we have your
[52:43] funeral tomorrow night other than that
[52:46] it's pretty much a given we're all gonna
[52:49] fall short we're gonna make mistakes
[52:51] come on somebody say Amen we are going
[52:54] to trespass against God's law so how is
[52:58] it that we have a right which is
[53:01] inalienable in other words it can never
[53:04] be broken God did not give us the
[53:07] Covenant as it was the original adamic
[53:10] Covenant God did not even give us the
[53:12] Covenant as he did to the children of
[53:15] Israel you can read about it Deuteronomy
[53:16] 14 5 Deuteronomy 6 the Romans 31
[53:19] Deuteronomy 33 you can read Jeremiah 31
[53:22] Jeremiah 35 you can read how that God
[53:25] set forth his Covenant and he said if
[53:27] you will do this I'll bless you I'll
[53:30] bless your coming in I'll bless your
[53:32] going out I'll make you the head and not
[53:34] the tail I'll do this and this and this
[53:37] if you will do this and this and this
[53:39] and God kept his part but they didn't
[53:42] keep theirs why were the Jews driven out
[53:45] of the promised land because they did
[53:47] not keep their Covenant if it was not
[53:49] for the grace of God God every one of us
[53:52] sitting here today and not only us but
[53:54] every other Christian that has lived
[53:57] since the cross would have been
[53:59] alienated from the Covenant of God and
[54:01] there wouldn't even be a gentile bride
[54:04] in the last day but God could not make
[54:07] it on the trust or the ability of a
[54:10] human being to keep a covenant now I
[54:13] don't care how righteous you think you
[54:15] are today how much you pray how much you
[54:17] read your Bible how many times you go to
[54:19] church you help the Widow you help the
[54:21] poor you do all of that there's not a
[54:24] person in this building or a person
[54:26] around the world that has the ability in
[54:30] them to keep every one of God's covenant
[54:33] promises and never fall short of the
[54:36] glory of God now here's some of you come
[54:37] to church today and then think you need
[54:39] Grace and I've done hit you right in the
[54:41] face with the awfullest need of Grace of
[54:43] your life you needed to praise God
[54:46] you're going to need Grace to walk out
[54:48] of this building you're going to need
[54:50] Grace to go to work in the morning
[54:51] you're going to need Grace to believe
[54:53] God with all of your heart because it's
[54:57] not in us don't ever get in your mind
[54:59] that it's in me oh I made up my mind
[55:02] glory to God I grabbed the whole of the
[55:05] horns of the altar I'm telling you one
[55:08] thing I made up my mind Oh Glory it
[55:13] wasn't you doing any of that it was the
[55:15] mercy of God
[55:17] how many of you have made up your mind I
[55:19] ain't serving God another day I'm
[55:21] turning back I can't take it no more you
[55:24] done made up your mind you don't pick
[55:26] talk some of your sisters unpicked out
[55:28] the new hairstyle you're just gonna have
[55:30] when you had your hair cut off you don't
[55:32] pick up brothers and pretty short she
[55:34] was going to slip on some of them
[55:36] Bermudas I guess or some of them
[55:39] Hawaiian ones with some pretty pink
[55:42] flowers so you look like what you're
[55:44] portraying a big well preach
[55:47] brother Donnie some of you don't pick
[55:49] out the brand the cigarettes is going to
[55:52] start smoking some of you may have
[55:54] picked out the alcohol you was going to
[55:56] start drinking and all of a sudden some
[55:58] got a hold to you that wasn't you it was
[56:01] bigger than you better than you greater
[56:04] than you more profound than you stronger
[56:07] than you who is it it's the Covenant
[56:09] keeping God and he come by his grace and
[56:13] undergirded you and the time of your
[56:15] greatest trial and gave you the ability
[56:18] to stand there and say Lord I'm so sorry
[56:20] I can't believe I was even thinking
[56:23] about going back to the world I cannot
[56:25] think I was even thinking about such a
[56:28] thing but what was it oh yes I I got a
[56:31] hold to myself you never done no such a
[56:33] thing he got a hold to you if he hadn't
[56:36] got a hold of you you'd have got to hold
[56:38] to yourself and you wouldn't be in
[56:40] church today it wasn't you all but I
[56:42] made up my mind yeah and then tomorrow
[56:44] you'll change it again but we're talking
[56:46] and about a god which made a covenant
[56:49] with Abraham and he did not say Abraham
[56:51] if you'll do this I'll do that and if
[56:54] you'll do this I'll do that but he said
[56:56] as for me my Covenant is with thee it
[57:01] was not upon congestions because Abraham
[57:04] lied Abraham fell short of the glory of
[57:07] God we're going to have church today
[57:09] Abraham lied Joseph oh Jacob look at all
[57:13] of those Patriarchs look at every one of
[57:15] the 12 sons and what they all done look
[57:18] at Peter falling short of the glory of
[57:20] God turned out to be a cussing preacher
[57:22] and denied the Lord Jesus said he even
[57:25] knew him it was not that Peter was a
[57:28] great man Peter was a coward when it
[57:30] come right down to it how was it that
[57:32] Peter could say I'll tell you Lord I'll
[57:35] never deny you no sir John will I know
[57:38] John ain't got the right Spirit about
[57:40] him James will deny you Lord and more
[57:43] solemn you will deny you but I'll tell
[57:45] you one thing Lord God I'll never deny
[57:48] you Hallelujah I'll stand up here praise
[57:51] God watch it Peter you're bragging on
[57:54] your flesh and God's Gonna humble it I
[57:56] wonder how many of us was like Peter
[57:58] I'll tell you one thing I'll be standing
[58:00] when there ain't nobody else and God
[58:03] will let you fall flat on your big face
[58:06] and mash that big mouth of yours and
[58:08] that big nose of yours and then you've
[58:11] got to get up and say oh Jesus I'm so
[58:13] sorry forgive me Lord I thought I was
[58:16] strong but I realize I ain't no come on
[58:19] somebody but God said I'm not gonna make
[58:22] this Covenant with her flesh I'm not
[58:25] going to make this Covenant with their
[58:27] faithfulness but I am going to make this
[58:29] Covenant with my seed which I will place
[58:33] inside of them it will motivate them it
[58:37] will mature them it will drive them it
[58:40] will lift them when they are low I will
[58:43] make this Covenant with myself and place
[58:47] a deposit of myself inside of them and
[58:51] this will be what brings to pass a
[58:53] tremendous victory in the love divine
[58:56] because it's not my determination it's
[58:59] not your determination hey we're going
[59:01] to have church this morning oh glory to
[59:03] God brother Donnie I love him so much I
[59:06] do too but there's times I've questioned
[59:08] that I haven't understood anybody to be
[59:11] honest with the Lord today have you ever
[59:13] questioned Lord I don't understand this
[59:15] and I don't understand that why is this
[59:17] going on and why is that going on but
[59:19] when my questions still don't get
[59:21] answered the seed of God is still there
[59:23] says so what's he going to do I said
[59:25] what you mean what I'm going to do I'm
[59:27] going to keep on serving him of course
[59:29] that's what I'm going to do I'm going to
[59:30] love him I'm going to go to church I'm
[59:32] going to preach I'm going to pray I'm
[59:34] going to do right I'm going to live
[59:36] right I'm going to speak right because
[59:38] there's something in me that's greater
[59:41] than me it ain't me it ain't you it
[59:44] ain't even your great desire it's the
[59:47] spirit of God that says there is nothing
[59:50] that can separate you from the love of
[59:52] God
[59:57] notice this the prophet said God don't
[59:59] want you to be frowning
[1:00:03] everybody look at the screen please
[1:00:06] and let your face know
[1:00:08] you believe this
[1:00:10] go ahead easy there you go

[1:03:39] and that and the other and the whole
[1:03:40] time you're said no worrying worrying
[1:03:42] word and die with cancer just like
[1:03:44] somebody living in Chicago bringing
[1:03:46] drinking in all the bad water and
[1:03:49] breathe in all the bad air and eating
[1:03:51] all the processed foods in your sentence
[1:03:53] to you well
[1:03:55] I don't understand
[1:03:58] worry

[1:04:16] have
[1:04:18] so tell me what you worried about and by
[1:04:21] worrying and worrying and worrying and
[1:04:23] worried and you worried your way to

[1:04:35] right into this triumphal entry
[1:04:37] Hallelujah to God it stole your dance
[1:04:40] worry will steal your praise worry will
[1:04:44] steal your Worship in the presence of
[1:04:47] God why has no virtue none
[1:04:57] help me Jesus
[1:05:02] temper will cause cancer
[1:05:04] now we won't dwell on that one too long
[1:05:06] because I do know that some folks in our
[1:05:08] church who have temper and I don't want
[1:05:10] them to display it on me this morning
[1:05:13] they'll never be upset just walk in love
[1:05:16] amen knowing that you're walking in him
[1:05:20] enough
[1:05:27] can harm you
[1:05:30] there's nothing can harm you there's
[1:05:32] neither Powers things present things
[1:05:34] future things can separate nothing can
[1:05:37] separate us
[1:05:38] from him
[1:05:40] we never come in by our own will he by
[1:05:44] choice
[1:05:46] elected us
[1:05:48] and brought glory to God brought into
[1:05:51] him you didn't come because you wanted
[1:05:53] to
[1:05:55] you come cause he wanted you to
[1:05:57] [Applause]
[1:06:02] so in other words I'm secure
[1:06:05] as long as he wants me
[1:06:08] you're secure as long as he wants you
[1:06:11] and he don't ever change his mind about
[1:06:13] his word
[1:06:15] so if he ever thought of you he can
[1:06:17] never sink a noose out of you I don't
[1:06:20] want you no more I don't love you no
[1:06:22] more oh I'm going to divorce you out of
[1:06:24] my mind he can never do that because
[1:06:27] he's God
[1:06:29] nothing can separate you from the love
[1:06:32] of God or you say praise God brother
[1:06:34] daughter if that's the way it is I'm
[1:06:36] going to go out today after church and

[1:06:53] how close you can get to the world you
[1:06:56] want to see how far you can stay away
[1:06:58] from it why would you want to hurt a
[1:07:01] beam like this that knew you could not
[1:07:05] keep a covenant impossible
[1:07:09] so he said this is what how to
[1:07:12] the book of Jeremiah
[1:07:15] shall come to pass in those days

[1:07:21] upon their hearts
[1:07:26] they will love me in spite of Mama

[1:07:51] sorry we're going we're I'll tell you
[1:07:53] what some of the laziest people people
[1:07:54] don't pray people don't put forth the
[1:07:56] effort near put forth the effort that

[1:08:00] troublesome to get on a drunk they
[1:08:02] better drive a good distance they got to
[1:08:04] sell their their car they got to sell
[1:08:05] their wheels off the car they've got to

[1:08:09] steal anything to come to church today
[1:08:10] did anybody have to hold up somebody on
[1:08:13] the side of their own side I've got to
[1:08:14] go to church I've got to get a fix I've
[1:08:15] got to get it fixed I got to go to
[1:08:16] church did anybody risk robbing anybody
[1:08:19] to be able to get gas to come to church
[1:08:21] the drunks do it drug addicts do it why
[1:08:24] because they've got to have their fix
[1:08:26] but not Christians we've got to be
[1:08:29] pumped
[1:08:31] all right everybody let's praise the
[1:08:33] Lord
[1:08:35] I just don't feel
[1:08:38] I'm so sad
[1:08:40] I'm soberden now
[1:08:42] Neil drunk us up
[1:08:45] today
[1:08:52] I don't care if it's an old lady
[1:08:55] I don't care if it's a little boy
[1:08:58] I need it
[1:09:00] you ought to walk through them doors
[1:09:01] back here and say devil
[1:09:03] I need a good dose of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:06] I need a good dose of Joy I need a good
[1:09:10] dose of just worshiping God so I'm
[1:09:12] learning you right now devil you better
[1:09:15] get out of my way because I've come to
[1:09:17] the house of God I'm going to let all
[1:09:20] hell know whose side I'm on I'm going to
[1:09:23] praise him I'm going to love him I'm
[1:09:26] going to sing to him I'm going to bless
[1:09:28] his name and I ain't gonna worry one
[1:09:32] minute
[1:09:36] cause you see when some folks come to
[1:09:39] church
[1:09:39] that's when the religious worry kicks in
[1:09:45] and then they go to thinking
[1:09:47] if I raise my hands
[1:09:50] what will they think
[1:09:54] I mean what what if I was to really
[1:09:55] yield myself to the Holy Ghost
[1:09:58] and the Lord made me act like brother
[1:10:00] Donnie it ain't so bad I've been doing
[1:10:02] this my whole life really it ain't that
[1:10:03] bad
[1:10:05] well what what would people say cancer
[1:10:08] causing agents
[1:10:12] so you're worried about this and
[1:10:14] worrying about that and worrying about
[1:10:16] somebody else and you're coming to the
[1:10:18] house of God to get free of your worry
[1:10:20] and you worry more once you get your kid
[1:10:22] than if you stayed home
[1:10:24] why because you're so concerned about
[1:10:26] what somebody else thinks I wonder what
[1:10:28] he thinks about us today is he pleased
[1:10:30] with the way you worship is he pleased
[1:10:33] with the amount of times you raise your
[1:10:35] hands and the amount of times you sing
[1:10:37] or is he pretty dissatisfied
[1:10:43] oh my goodness
[1:10:46] whoo is it just me or is it hot in here
[1:10:49] today
[1:10:52] so notice this nothing can separate us
[1:10:55] from him we're in him we never come our
[1:10:58] own well he by choice elected us and
[1:10:59] brought us so it's his business
[1:11:04] to take care of what he's took
[1:11:07] his self
[1:11:11] no man can pluck them from my father's
[1:11:14] hands because he's the greatest of them
[1:11:16] all amen it's the father who takes care
[1:11:20] of it who's got more power than God so
[1:11:25] what kind of power have you got over to
[1:11:27] take care of you the whole powers that
[1:11:31] created the universe is plural amen that
[1:11:34] took the solar system oh my and blew
[1:11:38] every Star went to its place he watches
[1:11:41] over you and the church said that's the
[1:11:45] kind of father we have
[1:11:48] how many believes what you just heard
[1:11:50] read that's the kind of father we have
[1:11:54] notice again he says God's purpose can
[1:11:57] never be defeated there is nothing can
[1:12:00] defeat it so how happy we are to be
[1:12:03] today resting upon that beautiful
[1:12:05] revelation of the word of the Living God
[1:12:08] that there is neither things present nor
[1:12:11] things can come nor sickness nor sorrow
[1:12:14] nor death nor perilous nor anything can
[1:12:17] separate us from the purpose of the
[1:12:20] Living God oh my brother down is bad the
[1:12:23] world is in bad shape I know it is
[1:12:25] friends but there is nothing that can
[1:12:28] separate you from the purpose of the
[1:12:31] Living God it ought not to weight us
[1:12:33] down in this Troublesome time it ought
[1:12:36] to give us such a consolation to know
[1:12:38] the same God that hail Shadrach Meshach
[1:12:41] Abednego and Daniel in the Lion's Den is
[1:12:45] the same one that's got to hold to your
[1:12:47] life today but I'm in the middle of
[1:12:49] trouble that's right you may be but he
[1:12:52] will bring you out of that trouble
[1:12:54] because there is nothing can stop his
[1:12:57] purpose
[1:13:01] Hallelujah
[1:13:05] there is nothing
[1:13:07] can ever separate God's Great Immortal
[1:13:12] Eternal plan
[1:13:13] it must be as God
[1:13:16] has
[1:13:18] said
[1:13:19] notice again Paul in verse 39 nor
[1:13:22] Heights nor depths nor any other
[1:13:25] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:13:28] again I love the way the prophet says it
[1:13:30] this way he called by election he sent
[1:13:33] his church in order and he said no man
[1:13:35] can come except the father draws him you
[1:13:39] never come to God because you wanted to
[1:13:44] you come because Christ called you
[1:13:47] if you're saved today cause you want to
[1:13:49] be if you change your mind that means
[1:13:51] you're lost again
[1:13:53] but if you're saved because he chose you
[1:13:55] well that means you'll never be lost
[1:13:58] hey man it is part of my rights that if
[1:14:02] it is my right why should I fear Why
[1:14:05] Should I Worry oh I hope I can make it I
[1:14:07] hope I can make it I've already made it
[1:14:08] by the grace of God there is nothing
[1:14:11] that can stand before us that will
[1:14:13] hinder us over brother Donny the
[1:14:15] tribulation this is coming that's coming
[1:14:16] that ain't got no effect on me I'm bride
[1:14:19] I ain't gonna be your middle tribulation
[1:14:21] period I'm going home in a Rapture I'm
[1:14:23] going home at a body shape well what if
[1:14:25] you get sick he said he'd heal me what
[1:14:27] if he faced disaster he said he'd Raised
[1:14:29] Me Up what if you face all kinds of
[1:14:31] terrible things I have I have my entire
[1:14:34] walk with god look fast I didn't get
[1:14:36] saved just yesterday I've been serving
[1:14:38] them for decades and let me stand right
[1:14:40] here and tell you today he has never all
[1:14:43] the years that I've been serving him he
[1:14:45] has never let me down he has never
[1:14:48] failed me anybody witness to the same
[1:14:50] thing I've been pastoring for over 40
[1:14:53] years and I'll tell you right now he has
[1:14:56] never failed me one time he will never
[1:15:00] fail any of us if we can trust him or of
[1:15:04] course
[1:15:05] we can just sit around
[1:15:07] and worry
[1:15:09] foreign
[1:15:18] I told you the so-called prophecy that I
[1:15:21] heard years ago in Pentecost
[1:15:24] when someone spoke in tongues and then
[1:15:25] someone supposedly prophesied
[1:15:28] he said yeah
[1:15:30] the times were so troubled
[1:15:33] even I
[1:15:35] am Shook Up
[1:15:40] that's not my Lord God
[1:15:43] my Lord God ain't never been Shook Up
[1:15:46] they make no nerve pills for the
[1:15:50] almighty the almighty does not need any
[1:15:54] nervous tonic he don't have a restless
[1:15:57] leg he don't have restless hand he don't
[1:16:00] have Restless Heart he don't have
[1:16:02] restless mind as a matter of fact when
[1:16:04] he come to the Earth and they thought
[1:16:06] they killed him and he showed up down on
[1:16:09] Hell's door and he knocked on the
[1:16:11] devil's door and the devil come to the
[1:16:13] door and said oh it's you the Lord Jesus
[1:16:16] was not saying they're shaking while I'm
[1:16:18] so terrified devil I'm so terrified he
[1:16:20] said I thought I got you and I got able
[1:16:22] now he said but I have arrived and my
[1:16:25] blood is hot on Calvary and I've come
[1:16:28] for the keys let me tell you something
[1:16:29] the Lord Jesus reached and grabbed a
[1:16:32] hole to the keys of death and hell and
[1:16:35] cancer and TB and oppression and sadness
[1:16:38] and weariness and he kicked that door
[1:16:41] shut and the devil don't even have the
[1:16:43] keys to his own house and you you are
[1:16:48] free
[1:16:49] you you are free
[1:17:00] or you can be like this
[1:17:14] or
[1:17:16] you can use reverse
[1:17:19] psychology
[1:17:20] on the devil
[1:17:24] and then when he comes around and of
[1:17:26] course they're making you
[1:17:28] you're going to say ah I'm devil I was
[1:17:31] only acting
[1:17:33] I'm going to get you close so I could
[1:17:35] burn your hide with a word
[1:17:39] so devil instead of me being nervous
[1:17:41] I've got an idea that you might ought to
[1:17:44] be the one nervous because the more
[1:17:45] preaching I'm hearing the more I realize
[1:17:47] who I am I'm a son and daughter of God I
[1:17:50] can't be lost I can never perish I can
[1:17:53] never be counseled out of the mind of
[1:17:55] God I'm here for a purpose and part of
[1:17:57] that purpose is to spread on serpents
[1:18:00] and to be able to stand against you cast
[1:18:02] out Devils heal the sin and live a life
[1:18:05] that makes hell tremble or wouldn't it
[1:18:07] be awesome if our church could make
[1:18:09] nervous Devils go to doing this
[1:18:11] [Applause]

[1:18:19] that's here there's a bunch of them here
[1:18:21] I can feel them
[1:18:22] but I hope they go like this down to
[1:18:24] Hell

[1:20:48] but Everlasting eternal life and we'll
[1:20:51] raise him up at the last day
[1:20:53] if that doesn't take the wind
[1:20:57] out of the out of Satan's sails
[1:21:01] I love doing that
[1:21:03] I love taking the wind out of Satan's
[1:21:07] sails because here we are out on this
[1:21:10] sea of time and Satan is depending upon
[1:21:13] the trade winds now those of you that
[1:21:16] studied Trade Winds understand that that
[1:21:18] one time in the world before they'd be
[1:21:20] able to go around the earth and explore
[1:21:22] it they thought if you could ever get
[1:21:24] away from what they known as
[1:21:26] civilization and the winds would carry
[1:21:28] you that way that proven it that the
[1:21:30] winds was moving a certain way on the
[1:21:32] Earth but they thought there'd be no way
[1:21:35] back
[1:21:36] so you'll just go in that One Direction
[1:21:38] and you'll never get back and then
[1:21:41] someone ventured out and found out that
[1:21:43] the winds come back another way so out
[1:21:47] you're out there they have no boat
[1:21:48] motors they have no other way the only
[1:21:51] way they can move is the wind
[1:21:56] so I wonder what kind of people would be
[1:21:58] here today if the spirit of God is able
[1:22:01] to take this word and go
[1:22:04] and blow the wind out of the devil's
[1:22:06] sails
[1:22:07] and the devil's sitting out there in the
[1:22:09] hot ocean
[1:22:13] what in the world is going on is that
[1:22:15] pressure
[1:22:16] what's that person I keep telling you
[1:22:18] dumb bunch of gnaw heads they get alone
[1:22:21] and get to praying and some of them go
[1:22:23] to breaking into some kind of language
[1:22:25] and talking strange stuff like I never
[1:22:28] heard in my life I know some of them
[1:22:29] boys are dumber and dirt daubers why
[1:22:31] they ain't smart at all how in the world
[1:22:33] can they speak in so many languages it's
[1:22:36] more than I understand and they come out
[1:22:38] of there they go in that study I have
[1:22:41] everything in the world I can to stop
[1:22:43] them I have the service to be a little
[1:22:45] bit tight and the guitar breaks the
[1:22:46] strain on the PA don't work and this
[1:22:48] don't work and that don't work and you
[1:22:50] know what they do they say we're not
[1:22:51] letting the devil stop this service
[1:22:52] we're having church here today so they
[1:22:55] go ahead and they start preaching they
[1:22:56] start saying and them saints it's like
[1:22:59] bombs it's like a smart bomb and he'll
[1:23:02] come over them with a drone and all of a
[1:23:04] sudden he'll push the trigger
[1:23:08] and they see it oh my Lord that's me and
[1:23:12] then he'll fly over another and it drops
[1:23:14] on that one and that one and that one
[1:23:16] another one and I I was convinced the
[1:23:18] majority of one even coming backwards
[1:23:20] and I I don't have them so down and so
[1:23:22] to feel they said well I guess this will
[1:23:24] be my life stay coming to church I ain't
[1:23:26] never coming back after church they went
[1:23:28] looking for me
[1:23:29] and they said all right devil where are
[1:23:32] you
[1:23:33] where are you you liar you liar you have
[1:23:38] defeated me you stole my joy you stole
[1:23:41] my happiness you caused me to worry from
[1:23:44] the time I wake up until I go to bed at
[1:23:46] night and then you even torment my
[1:23:48] dreams with worrying dreams
[1:23:52] but guess what today devil
[1:23:55] after this service
[1:24:01] I ain't worried
[1:24:13] now I ain't gonna ask you to raise your
[1:24:14] hands because I don't want you to lie
[1:24:17] when I wonder how many of you are Brave
[1:24:19] and Bold enough in God
[1:24:21] to make such a statement to hell
[1:24:26] I will never
[1:24:29] worry
[1:24:34] well I guess when close the service
[1:24:35] because I've done killed in it
[1:24:39] friends you want
[1:24:47] I wonder what kind of church we could be
[1:24:49] if we could believe and take God and his
[1:24:52] word
[1:24:56] brother Donnie how can you say such a
[1:24:58] thing
[1:25:00] when your daughter has been given up by
[1:25:03] the doctors
[1:25:05] one after another after another
[1:25:08] because my hope and in the doctors
[1:25:13] I'd rather die if I have no more
[1:25:15] treatment
[1:25:16] well I agree with that
[1:25:19] but Jesus Does
[1:25:24] but her pain has got worse it has and as
[1:25:27] it gets worse we just pray more don't we
[1:25:30] that don't change one thing
[1:25:33] but brother don't yell aren't you
[1:25:35] worried aren't you afraid that that the
[1:25:37] devil is going to take her out of God's
[1:25:38] hands that devil can never take one out
[1:25:41] of God's hands he ain't big enough he
[1:25:44] ain't got enough power come on children
[1:25:46] I'm just talking about my daughter I'm
[1:25:49] talking about yours and your sons and
[1:25:52] your family and your children but
[1:25:54] instead of believing we worry
[1:26:01] all right
[1:26:02] Paul said there's nothing present
[1:26:04] nothing future
[1:26:06] neither sickness or peril
[1:26:09] nothing could ever separate us from the
[1:26:12] love of God
[1:26:13] that's in Christ Jesus
[1:26:16] no bad bodies
[1:26:18] no UPS no doubs nothing else nothing can
[1:26:24] ever separate us from the love of God
[1:26:26] that's in Christ Jesus sickness sorrow
[1:26:29] hunger Strife differences in the church
[1:26:32] difference of opinion no matter what it
[1:26:34] is nothing can ever separate you from
[1:26:37] the love of God
[1:26:39] why you have a legal right
[1:26:44] well I have trouble yes
[1:26:46] well I have sickness you will what about
[1:26:49] Satan hit me with everything he can he
[1:26:51] certainly will but even at that he
[1:26:53] cannot do it unless God allows him to do
[1:26:55] it and if God allows him to do it he's
[1:26:57] doing it for a reason so that he can use
[1:27:00] you to prove his glory
[1:27:02] praise the Lord notice this he gives you
[1:27:05] an abstract title all the way back in
[1:27:07] the blood of Jesus Christ listen to this
[1:27:09] devil
[1:27:11] the blood of Jesus Christ is just as
[1:27:16] good
[1:27:18] as it would have been shed
[1:27:21] 10 minutes
[1:27:23] ago
[1:27:28] so if the Lord Jesus would have died
[1:27:30] right here on this Pulpit 10 minutes ago
[1:27:33] and y'all would have saw the blood come
[1:27:34] out of his body
[1:27:36] and you needed saving you'd run up and
[1:27:38] touch the blood and you needed healing
[1:27:40] I'll I'll touch the blood that come out
[1:27:42] of his body that that's the price of the
[1:27:44] atonement I'll be healed I'll be saved
[1:27:46] I'll be delivered
[1:27:49] can you imagine in your mind it's just
[1:27:51] as powerful
[1:27:53] as if he would have died 10 minutes ago
[1:27:55] instead of over 2 000 years ago
[1:28:00] but it won't do any good if you and I
[1:28:02] don't believe it's just as powerful you
[1:28:05] believe it's just as much God
[1:28:06] is he as much God as he was whenever he
[1:28:09] said let there be light and there was
[1:28:11] like absolutely I said every believer at
[1:28:15] your profession you're just scared to
[1:28:17] use your rights scared to use
[1:28:22] your rights
[1:28:24] what are we scared of we're scared the
[1:28:26] devil we'll come back and try to get us
[1:28:28] that's what we're scared of Brothers
[1:28:30] just skip that next part that's quite
[1:28:31] long let's go down to the next one
[1:28:33] handwriting on the wall paragraph 21 and
[1:28:36] the devil likes to work on you under
[1:28:37] pressure you know that's a trick of the
[1:28:39] devil but when the Christian knows his
[1:28:43] legal rights
[1:28:46] when you can quote God's word I'll never
[1:28:49] leave thee or forsake thee that takes
[1:28:51] all the oppression away and the clouds
[1:28:55] begin to clear back if you just know how
[1:28:58] God has promised God is faithful oh
[1:29:02] Hallelujah
[1:29:04] how many can take God at his word
[1:29:09] but brother Donnie what if I don't feel
[1:29:11] anything Jesus never did say that if you
[1:29:14] feel it you're better he said did you
[1:29:18] believe it
[1:29:19] notice again oh God what an evil thing
[1:29:21] Satan is he binds the helpless he comes
[1:29:24] in by force he puts the children of God
[1:29:26] into corners
[1:29:28] but tonight he's exposed
[1:29:31] and tonight we realize he is just a
[1:29:35] bluff
[1:29:36] he has no legal rights
[1:29:44] so if you go in after church today and
[1:29:46] while you were going to church
[1:29:48] somebody moved in your house
[1:29:50] now brother Philip it took y'all a long
[1:29:53] time to build that pretty little house

[1:30:20] hit him in the mouth and out all the way

[1:30:25] there ain't one of us I don't care how
[1:30:28] humble how loving how gentle if we would
[1:30:31] go home and someone had moved in our
[1:30:33] house while we were a church and we said
[1:30:36] well I guess we'll just have to find us
[1:30:38] another place to live
[1:30:40] hope you all enjoy it and they still you
[1:30:42] get ready to say hey wait a minute don't

[1:30:46] payments give us your forwarding address

[1:30:52] upkeep yes yes I'll give you my address
[1:30:54] as soon as I get a little pup tent on
[1:30:56] the side of the road and I'll let you
[1:30:57] know what my mailbox says no we'll never
[1:30:59] do that when it comes to our natural
[1:31:01] possession we'd fight we'd take somebody
[1:31:03] to court don't sit there and look at me
[1:31:05] like you wouldn't do it why you'd sue
[1:31:07] somebody in a New York minute if they
[1:31:09] come out there and they stole your car
[1:31:11] you might have an old jalopy on the
[1:31:13] outside and they're sitting out there

[1:31:16] said what's up well you believe that he
[1:31:18] stole my car that belonged to Great
[1:31:20] office on so and so on so if you would
[1:31:22] do that for a car if you would do that
[1:31:24] for a house what about your health what
[1:31:27] about your peace what about your joy
[1:31:30] what about your right to be a son or
[1:31:32] daughter of God well you need to take
[1:31:34] the devil to court and say Lord Jesus
[1:31:37] he's trying to steal my body and he's
[1:31:40] trying to steal my health but I want to
[1:31:43] sue the devil
[1:31:55] so you sisters go in
[1:31:57] and there they are sitting in the
[1:31:59] kitchen
[1:32:01] you got all over your young ones and
[1:32:02] told them to clean up the orange juice
[1:32:03] and pick up all the toast and all that

[1:32:15] and they went into your pantry and they
[1:32:16] vented everything out took what they
[1:32:18] wanted and they're piled up there in the
[1:32:20] house and they're they're smoking and
[1:32:22] they're drinking and they're committing
[1:32:24] adultery and doing all kinds of evil and

[1:32:29] that
[1:32:32] what are you going to do nine one one
[1:32:38] our kids know it
[1:32:41] I hope I don't know it better than we

[1:32:53] disease

[1:33:22] church I have no peace I'll lay down at
[1:33:25] night I had no peace

[1:33:30] children
[1:33:30] that I have prayed for in the last few
[1:33:33] weeks
[1:33:34] that cannot sleep at night
[1:33:37] unbelievable how many of your children
[1:33:40] are fighting oppression
[1:33:44] and demonic power
[1:33:48] and won't even let them sleep
[1:33:50] or torment them
[1:33:51] with awful dreams
[1:33:54] I'm sick of it
[1:33:57] what about parents
[1:34:00] wherever the dawn I guess that's just
[1:34:03] that just comes with the end time and I
[1:34:05] guess you know they ain't really nothing
[1:34:07] we can do speak for yourself
[1:34:10] I'm called to cast out devils
[1:34:13] praise the Lord
[1:34:20] Satan has no legal rights
[1:34:24] over our family
[1:34:27] over our heritage
[1:34:30] over
[1:34:31] our body

[1:34:38] expect it now you and sister Carol

[1:34:43] to be an old man I didn't need you to
[1:34:46] tell me that but thank you for the info

[1:34:51] that tells me I have to be trodden down
[1:34:54] with blood pressure show me one
[1:34:57] scripture in the Bible I find in my
[1:34:59] Bible that my Bible says they loved I

[1:35:04] prosper and be in
[1:35:09] would somebody please tell me the age

[1:35:23] Lord I never thought I'd ever be old
[1:35:25] enough to sign up on Medicare but
[1:35:27] believe it or not your pastor is on
[1:35:29] Medicare but I already had a Medicare it

[1:35:40] heard it myself I have never heard a
[1:35:42] sermon preach on Divine Health even
[1:35:44] though the prophet uses those terms and
[1:35:45] the Bible does but it's still in the
[1:35:48] Bible and it's still in the message a
[1:35:50] lot of folks emphasize Divine Healing
[1:35:52] Divine Healing what about Divine Health
[1:35:54] what about Divine Health well how good
[1:35:57] is well how old are you 120 well glory

[1:37:59] wondering about Brother Don he is
[1:38:01] Alzheimer's kicking in huh
[1:38:03] it's the mind of Christ actually
[1:38:06] [Applause]
[1:38:12] let me find a place to close there's no
[1:38:15] need
[1:38:16] for us to live
[1:38:18] and under privileged
[1:38:21] people
[1:38:23] there's no need for us to live in the
[1:38:25] defeated state
[1:38:27] because he defeated the devil and took
[1:38:29] all the principalities and powers and
[1:38:31] subdued them under his feet
[1:38:33] and they have no legal rights
[1:38:37] to rule
[1:38:38] over you
[1:38:40] we are Christians filled with the Holy
[1:38:42] Ghost
[1:38:43] and we don't have
[1:38:45] we don't have to have the devil dictate
[1:38:48] to us
[1:38:50] Christ delivered us total Deliverance
[1:38:56] delivered us from evil delivered us from
[1:38:59] sin
[1:39:00] delivered us from Habits delivered us
[1:39:03] from talking
[1:39:05] you know some of us still need to
[1:39:06] deliver from that for sure delivered us
[1:39:08] from blackguard delivered us from all
[1:39:11] kinds of smutty things
[1:39:16] pleat total Deliverance
[1:39:20] praise God
[1:39:23] praise God it's my right
[1:39:26] it's my right
[1:39:28] to walk with an Inseparable attitude
[1:39:33] toward God
[1:39:35] even when I don't feel him
[1:39:38] how many goes through that in your life
[1:39:40] and you just don't feel the Lord the way
[1:39:42] you want to people around you feeling it
[1:39:44] everywhere and it just seemed like you
[1:39:46] can't feel nothing you think God what's
[1:39:48] going on what Lord have he left me no
[1:39:50] that's your right he can never do that
[1:39:54] let me close with this
[1:39:57] you see God knew there but have to be a
[1:39:59] way by which he would project such
[1:40:01] things as I've talked to you about this
[1:40:03] morning
[1:40:04] because to the carnal mind
[1:40:07] it makes no sense
[1:40:10] and as much as we love and appreciate
[1:40:12] all the Medical Science has done to help
[1:40:14] us but you know yourself in your
[1:40:16] lifetime most of you that medical
[1:40:19] science has started identifying more
[1:40:21] genes and more things that are inherited
[1:40:25] so if somebody in your family have winds
[1:40:27] up with a certain thing then they want
[1:40:28] to check everybody else in the family
[1:40:30] well have they got it oh that's in your
[1:40:33] gene pool
[1:40:34] and if you're not careful you will
[1:40:37] accept that
[1:40:42] and science is making it easier for you
[1:40:44] to believe years ago people didn't know
[1:40:46] that many of these things run in their
[1:40:47] gene pool so they didn't expect them
[1:40:50] but now we do
[1:40:52] so now you can go get scanned
[1:40:56] Lord have mercy I wouldn't recommend
[1:40:57] that
[1:40:59] you come out there with a list that long
[1:41:03] well you're prone to this you're prone
[1:41:04] to that I wonder how many people signed
[1:41:06] for the whole list before they get to
[1:41:08] the parking lot to pick up their car
[1:41:12] [Music]
[1:41:14] for who has known
[1:41:17] the mind of the Lord
[1:41:20] that he may instruct him
[1:41:24] but we have
[1:41:26] the mind
[1:41:29] of Christ
[1:41:33] several New Testament words are used
[1:41:37] for this word mind this one here is
[1:41:39] newest
[1:41:40] understanding judging
[1:41:43] the capacity for Spiritual truths
[1:41:47] The Faculty of perceiving
[1:41:51] Divine things you see this is why some
[1:41:53] church members can never perceive
[1:41:55] spiritual things of God a sermon like
[1:41:57] today they say I visited that church
[1:41:59] today I believe that's the most strange
[1:42:02] place I've ever been in my life
[1:42:07] you know or something like that that was
[1:42:09] the nuttiest guy I ever heard in my life
[1:42:11] they said he's talking about all the
[1:42:13] stuff I never heard no such stuff well
[1:42:14] you see the natural carnal Church person
[1:42:16] cannot be able to comprehend because
[1:42:18] they don't have the mind of Christ the
[1:42:21] news of Christ
[1:42:23] notice what it is the faculty of
[1:42:26] perceiving divine things of recognizing
[1:42:28] goodness
[1:42:30] and of hating of evil this is why many
[1:42:32] church people become involved in
[1:42:34] something so evil and so wrong in a
[1:42:36] church body because they don't have the
[1:42:38] ability to discern between the two
[1:42:42] so Satan can move right among them with
[1:42:44] a false Doctrine whatever it is move
[1:42:46] right among them and it's amazing good
[1:42:48] people that love the Lord and they'll
[1:42:50] side with the wrong thing we say how can
[1:42:52] that be they're missing the mind of
[1:42:54] Christ they don't have the ability to
[1:42:56] discern between right and wrong so they
[1:42:58] will look at something as wrong as it
[1:43:00] can be by the word and they will look at
[1:43:03] it and say
[1:43:04] I don't see nothing wrong with it I
[1:43:06] think it's okay
[1:43:07] I think that's a good man that's a good
[1:43:09] woman I think that's good I think that's
[1:43:12] okay
[1:43:12] why they're missing this
[1:43:16] now watch the Power of considering and
[1:43:19] judging soberly calmly and impartially
[1:43:25] but you see a person without the mind of
[1:43:27] Christ will make judgments based upon
[1:43:30] how well they like that individual or
[1:43:32] that individual and if they like that
[1:43:34] person better than that person they'll
[1:43:36] take the scriptures and apply it a whole
[1:43:38] lot more Stern way because they like
[1:43:41] this one better
[1:43:42] well they're missing mind of Christ
[1:43:44] they're not missing scriptures they're
[1:43:46] missing the ability to judge impartially
[1:43:50] well it's the same way when it comes to
[1:43:52] our position in Christ This is why the
[1:43:55] bride has a different mind than the
[1:43:57] church so the church just thinks about
[1:43:59] getting along and just been able to
[1:44:01] surviving this world
[1:44:03] but the bride thinks about what should I
[1:44:05] be what does he want me to be what is my
[1:44:07] inheritance where am I going what what
[1:44:09] lays in front of us will you believe
[1:44:11] whatever you want to believe I just read
[1:44:13] at this moment where the Prophet said
[1:44:14] that he was looking for a time to come
[1:44:16] on the Earth when the anointing of God
[1:44:18] would come back on the earth and every
[1:44:21] felon of this church would be a
[1:44:23] refilling of the baptism of the Holy
[1:44:24] Ghost that would be the Dynamics I'm
[1:44:27] looking for that myself I'm not sure
[1:44:28] what you're looking for
[1:44:29] I peculiar mode of thinking and judging
[1:44:33] thoughts feelings purposes and desires
[1:44:36] so he has endowed us with the same
[1:44:39] disposition so we can read the word and
[1:44:42] with the mind of Christ if we have that
[1:44:43] we will read the word and we get out of
[1:44:46] it the exact same thing
[1:44:49] that God does
[1:44:53] ah
[1:44:55] therefore we're capable of knowing his
[1:44:58] mind and finding out his will
[1:45:01] for our lives so these teachings then
[1:45:03] are handed down
[1:45:05] to those who are part of the initiated
[1:45:09] Philippians 2 5 let this mind be in you
[1:45:13] which was also
[1:45:16] in Christ Jesus
[1:45:19] verse 6 who being in the form of God
[1:45:24] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:45:27] God
[1:45:33] so let the mind of self-empting
[1:45:38] be in you
[1:45:41] the mind of self emptying
[1:45:46] self-denial
[1:45:49] self crucifixion
[1:45:53] this is the way Jesus came to the Earth
[1:45:55] this was his mind let this mind be in
[1:45:57] you which was also in Christ Jesus who
[1:45:59] being on the form of God thought it not
[1:46:01] robbery to be equal with God
[1:46:05] and I hope you can take the other verse
[1:46:07] but made himself of no reputation
[1:46:11] no reputation so he wasn't a big guy you
[1:46:14] know I'm the biggest guy among my mama
[1:46:15] stuff sure top of God I'm the big guy no
[1:46:17] the mind was self-empting
[1:46:22] you see when we meet God on these
[1:46:24] grounds and we empty self God looks at
[1:46:28] us as a vessel ready to receive more of
[1:46:31] him
[1:46:41] [Applause]
[1:46:49] so the mind of Christ means the attitude
[1:46:51] exhibited
[1:46:53] by Christ himself show your attitude
[1:46:57] should be the same as Christ Jesus
[1:47:00] and of course your attitude will
[1:47:01] determine your attitude your altitude
[1:47:04] will also be determined by your destiny
[1:47:06] and you will be joined together
[1:47:09] with the other ones who've received the
[1:47:11] mind of Christ
[1:47:12] down through every age
[1:47:14] listen to this the angel of God it's the
[1:47:17] mind of Christ the human being has the
[1:47:20] privilege to enter in
[1:47:23] I know the mind of Christ hallelujah
[1:47:25] what a reality to dwell in the channel
[1:47:27] of Christ we unworthy Mortals we've been
[1:47:30] brought to be Sons and Daughters of God
[1:47:33] to be fellow citizens
[1:47:37] so we're given the opportunity
[1:47:40] I love it this way when the prophet was
[1:47:42] sitting in his room and the spirit of
[1:47:43] God came into the room and said pick up
[1:47:46] your pen
[1:47:47] and write
[1:47:50] you're familiar with it but let us start
[1:47:52] on down into it a few paragraphs now
[1:47:55] here is the secret
[1:48:00] the bride not only has the word
[1:48:04] but she has the mind of Christ
[1:48:09] to know what he wants done
[1:48:12] with the word
[1:48:15] but you see what Satan wants to do is
[1:48:18] mimic and impersonate those around us
[1:48:21] and they think just because they have
[1:48:23] the word alone that's all they need
[1:48:26] but watch what they do with it and
[1:48:28] they'll tell you whether they're out of
[1:48:30] their mind or not
[1:48:33] so what does God do projects to the
[1:48:35] elect
[1:48:37] the mind of Christ you see Paul wrote to
[1:48:39] Timothy and he said I have no other no
[1:48:43] other now remember there was Philemon
[1:48:45] that was Titus there was all kinds of
[1:48:46] other preachers but Paul said there is
[1:48:48] none other
[1:48:50] like you who is of the same mind
[1:48:55] as I am
[1:48:57] so Timothy was able not only to get
[1:49:00] Paul's Epistles and Paul's quotes
[1:49:03] but he got the same mind
[1:49:05] to know what God wanted done
[1:49:08] was Paul's word
[1:49:10] what was it replicate Christ
[1:49:13] not make a system
[1:49:16] so I'm asking you then
[1:49:18] what are you doing
[1:49:20] with the word God's given you
[1:49:23] we have this message we have the Bible
[1:49:25] we have all these things so what are you
[1:49:28] doing with it
[1:49:30] what do you think God wants done with
[1:49:33] the word
[1:49:35] just memorize it talk it
[1:49:38] debate about it argument fuss it
[1:49:41] what do you think God I'm asking you
[1:49:43] what do you think God wants done with
[1:49:47] his word
[1:49:50] nobody's gonna answer okay
[1:49:54] well I'll tell you what he once done
[1:49:56] and then you see where you're at
[1:49:58] he wants this word
[1:50:01] to be made flesh
[1:50:08] read it yes listen to it yes say Amen to
[1:50:12] it yes but don't stop there
[1:50:15] with the mind of Christ you take that
[1:50:18] and become a part
[1:50:21] of that word
[1:50:23] that when people see you they see an
[1:50:26] epistle you say that's crazy it is not
[1:50:28] it's your new testament Paul called them
[1:50:31] people and they're Believers in his day
[1:50:33] written Epistles of God read and known
[1:50:39] of all men
[1:50:41] I may wants it with all your heart
[1:50:45] let's bear our heads together if you
[1:50:46] would
[1:50:50] you see if God
[1:50:52] can get us as his people
[1:50:54] to this place that we not only memorize
[1:50:56] the word
[1:50:59] so when we're sick we quote scriptures
[1:51:02] about sickness when we're fighting
[1:51:04] battles we quote scriptures about
[1:51:05] whatever it is
[1:51:07] but God don't want us just quoting
[1:51:09] scriptures but God wants us
[1:51:12] at his time in his season now listen to
[1:51:14] me carefully
[1:51:17] to where it won't be you quoting it but
[1:51:19] the father himself included
[1:51:22] and you might quote the scripture if you
[1:51:24] say to this mountain be moved but if God
[1:51:27] ever says it
[1:51:28] that mountain is gone
[1:51:31] praise the Lord
[1:51:34] how many wants that in your life God can
[1:51:37] speak his word
[1:51:39] out of our lips I know it's astounding
[1:51:41] friends I know it's
[1:51:43] absolutely be considered idiotic
[1:51:47] to many people the world
[1:51:49] but yet the prophet said there's human
[1:51:51] faith and there's the faith of God and
[1:51:52] you must have a Godly face to believe
[1:51:54] now to have that Godly Faith you must
[1:51:56] have the mind of Christ in you that's
[1:51:58] how God projects to you Visions
[1:52:00] Revelations and all these things
[1:52:04] by Christ's mind
[1:52:06] being in you
[1:52:09] so you're right is
[1:52:11] inseparable
[1:52:13] and then here's another right
[1:52:15] you have a right to have the mind of
[1:52:17] Christ
[1:52:19] it's your right
[1:52:22] to have the mind of Christ
[1:52:27] Heavenly fathers we have our heads about
[1:52:31] we're asking you today
[1:52:33] for your help
[1:52:37] I know Lord that
[1:52:39] any person that would be physically able
[1:52:41] to read and able to hold the Bible
[1:52:44] would be able to read these verses
[1:52:47] but no doubt they would have a
[1:52:49] theological explanation to explain it
[1:52:52] why why it just doesn't make sense that
[1:52:54] we could have the mind of Christ
[1:52:57] but this is your word
[1:53:00] Lord I'm facing things in my life
[1:53:04] I don't know what to do
[1:53:07] no doubt some of these people standing
[1:53:09] here today could say the same thing they
[1:53:10] don't know which way to turn they don't
[1:53:12] know what to do
[1:53:14] yet they have scriptures they have
[1:53:16] quotes
[1:53:17] but they still don't know what to do
[1:53:19] with them
[1:53:21] Lord God we need you
[1:53:24] in our lives in such a way of Direction
[1:53:28] always love it when we cry we love it
[1:53:31] when the joy bells are ringing and we're
[1:53:34] jumping and shouting and praising God we
[1:53:36] love it
[1:53:37] but when we get done shouting and we get
[1:53:40] done rejoicing
[1:53:42] as your Prophet said we want to know we
[1:53:44] have the same amount of water that we
[1:53:45] had when was jumping up and down
[1:53:48] so we want to have the peace of God and
[1:53:51] Direction some of these young people

[1:53:56] them Lord trying to decide on their

[2:10:04] just let him know how much you love him
[2:10:07] what it means to you
[2:10:10] praise the Lord
[2:10:12] you're inseparable
[2:10:14] from his presence
[2:10:18] he wants to lead you and guide you
[2:10:21] he wants to love you
[2:10:24] when the minister sent me a quote
[2:10:26] yesterday
[2:10:28] and the prophet said the Lord
[2:10:31] Watches Over You day and night
[2:10:35] wanting to do things for you
[2:10:39] watch is over you day and night
[2:10:42] wanting to do things for you can you
[2:10:45] imagine God wanted Moses to build a
[2:10:48] tabernacle
[2:10:49] and put it in the midst of the
[2:10:51] congregation
[2:10:53] God wanted to come down by his Shekinah
[2:10:57] and live in that holiest of holies
[2:11:00] God wanted to hear him talk about their
[2:11:02] children
[2:11:03] and the problems and their issues and
[2:11:06] their troubles
[2:11:08] God said make me a tabernacle Moses
[2:11:11] suck and dwell among my people
[2:11:15] how honored we are to feel today that
[2:11:18] God don't want just to live in this
[2:11:20] place here and then when we go home here
[2:11:22] in a few minutes then we leave God
[2:11:24] behind
[2:11:25] but we take him with us
[2:11:27] and our souls
[2:11:30] because God said I don't want to leave
[2:11:32] you children
[2:11:34] when you sit down and talk to your wife
[2:11:36] about your issues
[2:11:38] I want you to know them they're
[2:11:39] listening
[2:11:40] when you're concerned about your
[2:11:42] grandkids when you're concerned about
[2:11:43] your bills and you're concerned about
[2:11:45] this and that I want you to know I'm in
[2:11:48] your midst
[2:11:50] and not be honored to help you if you'd
[2:11:52] let me
[2:11:54] praise the Lord
[2:11:56] praise the Lord God
[2:11:59] we worship you Lord Jesus
[2:12:02] forgive us for not making you a bigger
[2:12:05] part of our lives
[2:12:07] oh Jesus we want you to be part of our
[2:12:10] family
[2:12:11] we want you to be part of our decision
[2:12:13] making about our children's education
[2:12:16] about her vocation in life and what we
[2:12:19] should do
[2:12:20] I believe you would help us more if we'd
[2:12:22] only let you
[2:12:24] but somehow we think we're troubling you
[2:12:26] too much
[2:12:27] how many times have I been building
[2:12:29] something and I just couldn't figure it
[2:12:32] out
[2:12:33] or how many times have I been
[2:12:35] refinishing something and I could not
[2:12:37] get the stain combination correct
[2:12:41] and that would stop and pray
[2:12:43] and all of a sudden a thought would come
[2:12:46] to me
[2:12:47] mix this American Cherry number 206.
[2:12:52] with dark oak number 185.
[2:12:56] and then mix it together
[2:12:58] and there was the answer
[2:13:01] Lord you're concerned about the little
[2:13:04] things
[2:13:06] oh if these people only realized how
[2:13:08] much you want to be a part of their
[2:13:09] morning coffee
[2:13:11] when they're sitting there at their
[2:13:12] table
[2:13:13] and they're dreading the day and they're
[2:13:15] dreading the things they've got to face
[2:13:18] if they just talk to you their dreads
[2:13:21] would be lifted
[2:13:22] and the worries would be gone and they
[2:13:24] could start today with peace
[2:13:27] instead of worry
[2:13:29] oh Jesus we worship you
[2:13:33] We Worship You Holy Father
[2:13:37] thank you Lord God
[2:13:41] sing something let's just worship can we
[2:13:43] just take a few more minutes I know you
[2:13:45] got your lunch and all that but let's
[2:13:47] just take a few a few more minutes
[2:13:48] before we go in his presence
[2:13:51] oh Father out on the water
[2:13:56] storms raging High I get waters around
[2:14:03] them yes the trouble their mind
[2:14:07] so true for fear in their hearts and
[2:14:12] they thought they would die all they
[2:14:16] would die Bill to remember

[2:14:34] it must obey his will
[2:14:38] he calmed their storm
[2:14:41] just like he will mind
[2:14:45] if I'll just stream in
[2:14:49] he lives deep inside
[2:14:53] why should I work hurry
[2:14:58] why should I feel the very same Jesus
[2:15:04] he stays always near he lives in my
[2:15:10] heart
[2:15:12] and he hears when I cry I call on the
[2:15:18] master till the storm passes by
[2:15:27] we read in the Bible
[2:15:31] how he walked with him brought light
[2:15:36] with a darkness when the way grew so
[2:15:41] down how great it would be
[2:15:54] all of the time when troubles
[2:16:15] [Music]
[2:16:20] all I have to do is
[2:16:36] saying Jesus he stays always
