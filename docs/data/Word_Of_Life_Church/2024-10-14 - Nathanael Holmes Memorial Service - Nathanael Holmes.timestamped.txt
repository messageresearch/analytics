[1:22:54] but Lord we are very well reminded of
[1:22:56] what your word tells us we don't see all
[1:22:58] things we don't understand all things
[1:23:01] but we do see you and Lord I pray that
[1:23:03] you would come may your anointing rest

[1:23:14] hearts Lord we're reminded again of your
[1:23:16] word that says you're very near a broken
[1:23:19] heart and a contrite spirit Lord we
[1:23:21] commit this service tonight into your
[1:23:23] hands move among us and have your way
[1:23:25] Lord Comfort the hearts and lives of The
[1:23:28] Grieving family friends dear loved ones
[1:23:30] of our departed brother in Jesus
[1:23:33] Christ's name we pray
[1:23:35] amen want to take this opportunity to
[1:23:38] extend our condolences to the family and
[1:23:41] friends of our dear departed brother
[1:23:43] brother Nathaniel I count this a very
[1:23:46] honor and a privilege to be asked by the
[1:23:48] family to stand here today and take a
[1:23:50] few moments and speak something
[1:23:52] concerning his life and just to share sh
[1:23:54] a few things I thought a lot of brother
[1:23:56] Nathaniel thought the world of him his
[1:23:59] family spent many Sunday afternoons
[1:24:01] together with them and the children and
[1:24:03] sister Sue and The Wades and their homes
[1:24:06] and uh many trips uh I looking at the
[1:24:09] pictures here many trips with the family
[1:24:12] together down to Pigeon Forge and I just
[1:24:14] want to take a moment here and thinking
[1:24:17] of this time I'm reminded tonight of a
[1:24:20] prophet's prayer when he would say these
[1:24:22] words he would say Comfort the
[1:24:24] uncomfortable and make known thyself in
[1:24:26] our midst and may you do something
[1:24:29] tonight for us Lord a special thing I
[1:24:32] trust the Lord tonight to come among us
[1:24:34] even in this moment and do something
[1:24:36] special for the hearts of the family
[1:24:38] that's grieving I would like to just
[1:24:40] share uh a few moments of the last time
[1:24:43] that I had the privilege to be with
[1:24:45] brother Nathaniel and sister Sue we met
[1:24:47] just a few short months back and spent
[1:24:50] uh probably two or three hours together
[1:24:52] at a a coffee shop and just was talking
[1:24:54] and uh sharing some time together and I
[1:24:58] will always remember the last few things
[1:25:00] I heard him say and the last time I was
[1:25:03] privileged to see was just assuring me
[1:25:05] of his beliefs in this great message
[1:25:07] that God has sent us and all that God
[1:25:09] has done in this generation and tonight
[1:25:12] I believe we can take comfort in those
[1:25:13] words and knowing that in his soul those
[1:25:17] things were settled in St John chap 14
[1:25:20] and verse 16 Jesus said I will pray the
[1:25:22] father and he shall give give you
[1:25:24] another comforter that he may abide with
[1:25:27] you forever in St John chap 14 and: 18
[1:25:31] Jesus speaking again he said I will not
[1:25:33] leave you comfortless but I will come to
[1:25:36] you how thankful we are tonight in times
[1:25:38] like these that we are not left helpless
[1:25:41] and hopeless but we are left with a
[1:25:43] comforter who knows all things I think
[1:25:46] of how in first Thessalonians chapter 4
[1:25:49] and: 18 as many of you here know that
[1:25:52] the prophet of God would use that in
[1:25:54] this text for the Rapture and he would
[1:25:56] speak many things there that would
[1:25:58] comfort the hearts of Believers but at
[1:26:00] the end of that verse Paul would say
[1:26:02] these words wherefore Comfort one
[1:26:05] another with these words I think of the
[1:26:08] words of our prophet and just a quote
[1:26:10] that come to my heart the other day I
[1:26:12] would like to share when I heard of the
[1:26:14] news of the passing of our brother and
[1:26:16] the message the testimony of a true
[1:26:18] witness brother Brandon would tell us
[1:26:20] now the one reason that I am a
[1:26:21] calvinistic thinker of the security of
[1:26:24] the believer is because that I believe
[1:26:27] that when a man or a woman is in their
[1:26:29] right mind that is the time to accept
[1:26:31] the Lord Jesus and get it all settled
[1:26:33] then once and forever because when we
[1:26:36] come to the end of the road we don't
[1:26:37] just know where and how we're going to
[1:26:39] be sick he said we may be sick in our
[1:26:41] mind there might be a fever that would
[1:26:43] really cook our very brain and we might
[1:26:45] say anything or do anything we don't
[1:26:46] know but you see if we have already
[1:26:49] already Anchored In Christ no matter
[1:26:51] what sickness takes us or what condition
[1:26:53] we are in
[1:26:54] it's already settled we are sealed until
[1:26:58] the day of our Redemption Ephesians 4:30
[1:27:01] says grieve not the holy spirit of God
[1:27:04] whereby you are sealed until the day not
[1:27:07] of your death but the day of your
[1:27:10] Redemption see after death is done over
[1:27:14] you are still sealed this evening I
[1:27:16] would like to share this with you from
[1:27:18] my heart our enemy the devil can touch
[1:27:20] our flesh he can trouble us in our
[1:27:23] spirit but I am so thankful tonight to
[1:27:25] know that he can never touch our soul
[1:27:29] once it is sealed by the Holy Ghost I
[1:27:32] believe our brother was a testimony of a
[1:27:34] seal of God upon his soul no matter what
[1:27:37] the devil would do to the flesh or the
[1:27:39] spirit I believe the soul was sealed and
[1:27:42] someday we will meet our brother again
[1:27:44] on the other side I believe that's more
[1:27:47] than just words I believe those words of
[1:27:49] a Vindicated Prophet were the words of
[1:27:52] comfort to this generation I believe God
[1:27:54] had this not in mind that no matter what
[1:27:57] has happened or what has transpired we
[1:27:59] have words to comfort one another we
[1:28:01] will see our brother again we take
[1:28:03] comfort in that we say to the family may
[1:28:06] God bless you all may God wrap his arms
[1:28:07] around you may God visit you may God
[1:28:10] show himself to you and may God
[1:28:12] ultimately give you the peace that no
[1:28:14] man or anything else can give you the
[1:28:16] peace that passees all understanding God
[1:28:18] bless you
[1:28:32] for
[1:28:37] [Music]

[1:33:21] departed brother all of those who you
[1:33:24] that have come to express your
[1:33:27] condolences as well we thank you for
[1:33:30] that in such a time as this we can truly
[1:33:33] find comfort from God's presence but all
[1:33:38] also his word as I was reading this
[1:33:41] evening from The Book of Job
[1:33:45] and uh reminisced the verses that job
[1:33:49] had said when he went through such
[1:33:51] hardship and difficulty and the Bible
[1:33:54] says that job cursed his
[1:33:58] day and he said cursed be the day that a
[1:34:02] man child was
[1:34:04] conceived why did not I die in my
[1:34:07] mother's
[1:34:09] womb why was it said cursed be the time
[1:34:13] why did not I go why did not he was so
[1:34:18] low he couldn't understand where he was
[1:34:21] at he couldn't understand what he was
[1:34:23] going through
[1:34:24] the only thing I need to do is just look
[1:34:26] at his
[1:34:28] conception his
[1:34:31] origination the night that I was
[1:34:33] conceived and the day that I was born
[1:34:36] and why would this ever
[1:34:39] happen a situation like this that we are
[1:34:42] looking at tonight it brings me to a
[1:34:46] place to where I desire to be more
[1:34:50] sensitive I guess I could say to the
[1:34:53] needs and the things that are people
[1:34:55] going through around
[1:34:57] us sometimes we never know we never know
[1:35:01] what people are thinking and what
[1:35:02] they're battling you know when the Lord
[1:35:05] God made man in the beginning and he
[1:35:08] made him a dimensional being so he had a
[1:35:12] soul he had a spirit and he had a body
[1:35:16] each one of those are contacted by
[1:35:18] different
[1:35:19] Avenues his soul by free will his Spirit
[1:35:22] imagination conscience reason and
[1:35:25] affection as outside man see taste feel
[1:35:27] smell and here there's things we could
[1:35:30] say about the soul we couldn't say about
[1:35:31] the spirit and the body and we know and
[1:35:35] we are taught that a person could be
[1:35:38] insane in their mind and yet be filled
[1:35:41] with the Holy Ghost that would stumble
[1:35:44] some people because they don't
[1:35:45] thoroughly understand the separation
[1:35:47] between that
[1:35:48] part and some might in their hearts and
[1:35:52] in their minds wonder you know a
[1:35:55] Christian How could a Christian go and
[1:35:58] not leave this world in a blaze of glory
[1:36:01] How could a Christian not just go to
[1:36:03] sleep and wake up on that Resurrection
[1:36:06] morning oh but you see there's many of
[1:36:08] God's children that it went by way that
[1:36:12] we wouldn't think was very glorious at
[1:36:14] all can you imagine the head of a
[1:36:16] prophet called John the Baptist being
[1:36:19] served up to a dancing
[1:36:21] girl a dancing girl
[1:36:24] and God let that prophet's head be cut
[1:36:27] off like a chicken in a
[1:36:31] barnyard I think of Jonah whenever he
[1:36:33] had obeyed the command of
[1:36:37] God and whenever he done what God told
[1:36:41] him to do one of the largest meetings a
[1:36:44] man's ever had 120,000 people got
[1:36:49] converted instead of Jonah being happy
[1:36:51] about it he was all tore up and sad
[1:36:54] he just couldn't understand what in the
[1:36:55] world's going on here I told these
[1:36:57] people this thing was going to happen to
[1:36:59] them and now they've all repented this
[1:37:00] ain't the way I thought it was going to
[1:37:02] be so he goes out and he trying to find
[1:37:05] a little bit of shade and God let a Vine
[1:37:07] grow out on a tree and a worm come out
[1:37:10] and ate it oh Jonah he was he was in a
[1:37:14] fix you think um how that as
[1:37:19] Christians we in our right mind in
[1:37:21] serving the lord Jesus yet living in a
[1:37:24] world that we're under an onslaught
[1:37:26] constantly day in and day out and Jonah
[1:37:30] looked and said would to God just would
[1:37:33] to God I could die I don't even want to
[1:37:35] live no more you imagine a man just had
[1:37:38] one of the greatest meetings that'll be
[1:37:40] known upon the human race of people
[1:37:43] becoming converted and he don't even
[1:37:45] want to live so what is it that gets a
[1:37:48] halt of human beings
[1:37:51] sometimes to where they just don't want
[1:37:53] to live anymore you see for those of you
[1:37:55] that's never been there it might be
[1:37:57] quite easy for you to sit and criticize
[1:38:00] and say well I'll tell you one thing I
[1:38:01] wouldn't do this or that well possibly
[1:38:05] just maybe you've never been there
[1:38:09] yourself so if you've never W walked
[1:38:12] there then you would know how Elijah
[1:38:14] felt under the juniper tree when he'd
[1:38:17] have a nervous
[1:38:19] breakdown God had sent him to do a great
[1:38:21] work and he did it and after he had done
[1:38:24] it then the anointing leaves him and he
[1:38:26] falls into that state he doesn't know
[1:38:29] what to do I'm reminded of our Prophet
[1:38:31] messenger of this age had it not been
[1:38:33] for the mercy of God he would have taken
[1:38:36] his own life several times
[1:38:39] over so when we think of here we are as
[1:38:43] Mortals pleas you're in contact with
[1:38:46] each other that we might be able to help
[1:38:48] each other along the way sometimes we do
[1:38:52] a pretty good job I guess sometimes not
[1:38:54] so much because as humans we clash with
[1:38:58] one
[1:38:59] another but may God help each of us as
[1:39:02] we continue our life and our brother's
[1:39:06] life has now come to its close we will
[1:39:09] stand before the Lord one day and all of
[1:39:11] us will as an
[1:39:13] individual but may circumstances like
[1:39:16] this make
[1:39:18] us more aware of those that are around
[1:39:22] us and maybe we don't even have a clue
[1:39:25] what they're going through and in their
[1:39:27] mind they're toying with these thoughts
[1:39:30] they don't want to live they don't want
[1:39:32] to survive they just don't want to do it
[1:39:34] anymore and they become
[1:39:37] overwhelmed a friend of mine by the name
[1:39:39] of Doug McHugh many years ago he was a
[1:39:41] pastor in Tucson and he shared this
[1:39:44] story with me and I I'll
[1:39:45] close he was pastoring in San Jose sou
[1:39:48] California and when a prophet was here
[1:39:51] he he had come under the influence of
[1:39:53] his meetings and things and there was a
[1:39:55] man in brother Doug's church that took
[1:39:58] his life so brother Doug's background
[1:40:01] was a Pentecostal like mine and many
[1:40:04] others maybe here and if they did that
[1:40:08] there was no repentance you were lost
[1:40:11] that's all there was to it so brother
[1:40:14] Doug didn't know what to do so he calls
[1:40:16] up and he talks to the prophet and asks
[1:40:19] him what do I do how do I preach this
[1:40:23] what what do I say now he told me this
[1:40:26] story
[1:40:27] himself and he said remember brother
[1:40:30] duck a person who does that they are not
[1:40:34] thems and they're not in their right
[1:40:37] mind I wonder how many of us Christians
[1:40:39] here tonight have said today is my last
[1:40:42] day serving God I ain't doing it no more
[1:40:45] I ain't going back to church I ain't
[1:40:47] going to do this that and other aren't
[1:40:49] you grateful for the grace of God that
[1:40:52] helps us under such times yet some
[1:40:55] people go so
[1:40:57] far and it's like they can't get
[1:41:00] back sister Sue and her children need us
[1:41:03] like never before to pray with them to
[1:41:06] stand with them to do everything that we
[1:41:09] can to be able to help them during this
[1:41:12] great loss a death to someone that you
[1:41:14] love it's very very painful this
[1:41:17] Wednesday night will be a year that my
[1:41:20] daughter Erica was taken from us I'm Mr
[1:41:23] still crying I'm still weeping I still
[1:41:26] feel the pain of that
[1:41:27] loss so when you go home tonight or
[1:41:30] tomorrow whenever you do please don't
[1:41:32] forget them drop them a line a text a
[1:41:36] WhatsApp a phone call something just to
[1:41:38] let them know that you love them and
[1:41:41] you're praying for him during these Hard
[1:41:43] Times may the Lord bless youall
[1:42:32] time measured out my
[1:42:38] days life carried me
[1:42:46] along in my soul I
[1:42:50] ear to follow God
[1:42:55] but do I
[1:42:57] never be so
[1:43:00] strong I looked hard at this
[1:43:04] world to learn how
[1:43:08] Heaven could
[1:43:14] be just to end where I
[1:43:18] began where human effort
[1:43:23] is all in
[1:43:29] vain but were it not for
[1:43:37] Grace I can tell you
[1:43:41] where i'
[1:43:44] be wanding down some
[1:43:47] pointless Road to
[1:43:51] Nowhere with a my
[1:43:55] salvation up to
[1:43:58] me I know how that would
[1:44:05] go the battles I would
[1:44:08] [Music]
[1:44:12] face
[1:44:14] forever
[1:44:16] running but
[1:44:18] losing the
[1:44:20] race but were it not for
[1:44:25] [Applause]
[1:44:27] Grace so here is all my
[1:44:35] praise expressed with all my
[1:44:42] heart offered to the
[1:44:46] friend who took my
[1:44:50] place and ran the court
[1:44:53] I could not
[1:44:56] start and when he saw in
[1:45:01] full just how much his love would
[1:45:10] cost he still went the fin
[1:45:14] mile between me in heaven so I would not
[1:45:20] be lost
[1:45:26] were it not for
[1:45:33] Grace I can tell you
[1:45:37] where I
[1:45:40] be wanding down some
[1:45:43] poess Road to
[1:45:48] Nowhere with my
[1:45:51] salvation oh
[1:45:53] to me I know how that would
[1:46:01] go the battles I would
[1:46:08] face
[1:46:10] forever
[1:46:12] running but losing the
[1:46:16] race were it not for Grace
[1:46:23] [Music]
[1:46:25] forever
[1:46:27] running but
[1:46:28] losing the
[1:46:31] race were it not for Grace
[1:46:36] [Music]
[1:47:06] you know when you know
[1:47:09] somebody you want to talk about
[1:47:15] them they've been coming to the church
[1:47:17] for the past three years I'm
[1:47:21] guessing faithful
[1:47:23] who is this
[1:47:25] man it was a man of Faith a man of
[1:47:29] character a man of
[1:47:34] love he bore a cross that many of you
[1:47:37] may never
[1:47:39] carry he had a job that many of you will
[1:47:41] never
[1:47:43] understand some of our brothers and
[1:47:45] sisters that or in our congregation they
[1:47:48] they know about nursing and doctoring
[1:47:50] some of you do too
[1:47:53] and
[1:47:56] uh it's hard to hold back the tears at
[1:48:00] times because of how it
[1:48:04] happens and I see the joy in a man's
[1:48:09] face and the life that he
[1:48:12] lives under the
[1:48:14] pressure he continued serving
[1:48:19] God and while he was doing that service
[1:48:23] he was being
[1:48:27] attacked and the Bible talks about
[1:48:29] there's many of the
[1:48:31] righteous were always attacked many of
[1:48:35] the afflictions of the righteous but the
[1:48:38] Lord he said I'll deliver you out of
[1:48:41] them
[1:48:43] all and I looked at brother
[1:48:46] Nathaniel the
[1:48:49] situation all that's been dealt to him
[1:48:51] and how that he's battled through all
[1:48:53] that he's been going
[1:48:56] through and when we got the call last
[1:48:59] Saturday a week
[1:49:02] ago I knew there was something we needed
[1:49:04] to
[1:49:05] do and it wasn't that I needed to
[1:49:09] say anything I just needed to be
[1:49:14] there so immediately my wife and I when
[1:49:16] I told her she be to she begin to
[1:49:20] weep you see my wife suffered
[1:49:24] in that same direction one
[1:49:28] time she wanted to leave this
[1:49:31] world she couldn't understand
[1:49:34] love she couldn't understand how to take
[1:49:38] care of three little
[1:49:41] children she would look me in the eye
[1:49:43] and say I don't love
[1:49:45] you I knew that wasn't the woman I
[1:49:47] married yes
[1:49:50] sir but the God I serve
[1:49:54] with the Seal of the Holy
[1:49:57] Ghost he took care of
[1:49:59] her He restored her back to
[1:50:03] me sister
[1:50:05] Sue he's going to be restored back to
[1:50:08] you maybe not in this
[1:50:11] life but we believe that God is in
[1:50:14] control of all
[1:50:15] things and when God is in control of all
[1:50:19] things we have nothing to fear
[1:50:24] when the pressure gets on you when my
[1:50:27] wife would tell me she wanted to to
[1:50:30] leave this world and take her
[1:50:34] life it put me into a different kind of
[1:50:37] thought
[1:50:39] pattern it took me from a realm of just
[1:50:43] hallelujah praise the Lord to Lord I'm
[1:50:47] desperate I need
[1:50:50] you this family needs needed
[1:50:54] God and he they still need God even
[1:50:59] today as I was looking and thinking
[1:51:01] about the pressures that we go through
[1:51:04] and I didn't realize why the Lord would
[1:51:05] let us go through such an awful time
[1:51:07] that he
[1:51:08] did back in 1988 when my wife was at the
[1:51:12] point of death the doctors told me
[1:51:14] within two to three days she'll
[1:51:17] die and
[1:51:19] I with all my heart brother Jackie
[1:51:21] Benton was preaching for my dad that
[1:51:24] weekend when the doctor said she had
[1:51:26] maybe two or three days to
[1:51:28] live she's inting the hospital and I go
[1:51:31] to my father and brother Jackie is there
[1:51:34] and I say I don't know what to
[1:51:36] do and they told me gave me the right
[1:51:41] advice but little did we know it would
[1:51:43] shov into a deep depression what the
[1:51:46] doctors did you see doctors sometimes
[1:51:48] they they do things that doesn't always
[1:51:51] help we can't always
[1:51:55] understand but every step of the way of
[1:51:58] a
[1:51:59] Believer is led by God the footsteps of
[1:52:02] the righteous are ordered of the Lord
[1:52:06] you say but I don't understand why did
[1:52:08] this
[1:52:09] happen you'll have to understand it
[1:52:11] better by and
[1:52:12] by God is in control of brother
[1:52:16] Nathaniel's life and his
[1:52:19] Destiny I want to read from Ephesians
[1:52:21] chapter 1 because I
[1:52:23] believe in this
[1:52:27] scripture and as I was you said but what
[1:52:30] a scripture is this for a
[1:52:32] funeral now we're we're talking about a
[1:52:35] man who's no longer in this
[1:52:39] flesh but as we were taught by the
[1:52:41] prophet of God he's just
[1:52:47] sleeping but he knows where we
[1:52:49] are he can see us right here now
[1:52:54] we can say a lot of nice things but he
[1:52:57] lived his
[1:52:59] testimony he knew where he stood with
[1:53:01] God and God knew where he stood with him
[1:53:05] Ephesians chapter 1 verse one it says
[1:53:07] Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[1:53:09] will of God to the Saints which are at
[1:53:12] Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ
[1:53:15] Jesus Grace be to you in peace from God
[1:53:18] our Father and from the Lord Jesus
[1:53:20] Christ he's the only only one that can
[1:53:23] give you the
[1:53:24] grace and the strength to carry the load
[1:53:27] that you're going to
[1:53:28] carry Emma Whitney
[1:53:33] Levi I'm not your
[1:53:35] father brother Donnie is not your father
[1:53:39] but we as men of God we understand that
[1:53:42] we need to help carry
[1:53:45] you brother Emanuel will do all he can
[1:53:49] to help you Sister Carol your
[1:53:52] grandmother will help
[1:53:53] you I want you to just take a look
[1:53:55] around at all the
[1:53:57] support you'll support her right you'll
[1:54:01] love them
[1:54:02] right brother Donnie and sister Carol we
[1:54:05] prayed and
[1:54:06] prayed for
[1:54:08] Erica we trust the Lord we know where
[1:54:11] she
[1:54:12] is and for us who believe this
[1:54:16] word it said blessed be the God and
[1:54:19] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha
[1:54:21] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[1:54:23] in Heavenly places in
[1:54:26] Christ worldly
[1:54:29] pleasures they're good for a little
[1:54:30] season but when you're in Christ the
[1:54:34] power and the glory that's revealed in
[1:54:36] you is what's giving you the power to
[1:54:39] continue in believing this and verse
[1:54:42] four he says and according as he hath
[1:54:44] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[1:54:47] of the world that we should be holy and
[1:54:50] Without Blame before him in
[1:54:54] love this man is not to
[1:54:58] blame we had a prophet messenger who
[1:55:01] would preach a message the greatest
[1:55:02] battle ever
[1:55:04] fought and he talked about the Mind
[1:55:06] battle and how that the enemy would
[1:55:08] challenge us in our mind and I'm going
[1:55:11] to tell you something friends you know
[1:55:13] it's real how many of us have had bad
[1:55:17] thoughts about somebody or we wanted to
[1:55:19] take care of something oursel and then
[1:55:20] we have to turn and say Lord forgive me
[1:55:24] I didn't want to think that way I don't
[1:55:26] want to say those kind of things and God
[1:55:28] in his grace and mercy says I understand
[1:55:31] your pressure because in these mortal
[1:55:33] bodies we suffer so many things and we
[1:55:36] challenge many things but yet God
[1:55:40] understanding God and he brought the
[1:55:42] power of His Spirit into us and because
[1:55:46] he brought the power of His Spirit into
[1:55:48] us he said we could be the Overcomers
[1:55:50] we're not survivors of this age we're
[1:55:53] the Overcomers of this age and God by
[1:55:57] his authority has put his spirit in us
[1:56:01] to give us the authority over the devil
[1:56:03] and over his spirits you said but where
[1:56:06] were you at when he needed you I didn't
[1:56:08] really understand that he had depression
[1:56:10] because when he would come to church he
[1:56:12] would out of the church he'd go man and
[1:56:16] most everybody knows him knows that when
[1:56:18] his church is over when you say the amen
[1:56:21] he's done
[1:56:23] I'm out of here how many knows he does
[1:56:24] that he would just leave after the
[1:56:26] church he's not mad at nobody that's
[1:56:28] just how he was some of you know that he
[1:56:31] was a cut up some of you know he'll pull
[1:56:33] a he'll pull a gag on you if he gets a
[1:56:35] chance he was a happy guy he'd do
[1:56:38] certain things some of the fam they're
[1:56:40] not in head yeah I know who was this man
[1:56:43] he was a man who could understand people
[1:56:45] when they were hurting when they were
[1:56:48] sick he worked in the ER and he worked
[1:56:50] his different parts in the the
[1:56:53] nursing and I have several people two
[1:56:56] weeks ago I think it was September 29th
[1:56:58] they were in the service for the last
[1:56:59] time with brother Nathaniel and I was
[1:57:01] preaching and I was was preaching I
[1:57:03] started talking about some of the young
[1:57:05] people and and some of the things they
[1:57:06] need to be doing and I got him to
[1:57:09] laugh sitting in the back row he was
[1:57:11] looking and and I just happened to look
[1:57:13] his way and he was really he was with
[1:57:16] me and he could
[1:57:19] see what was taking place and so here he
[1:57:22] is he's a man and and many of you have
[1:57:24] testified brother Aaron you
[1:57:27] testified that he was there when you
[1:57:30] needed him my son was telling me what a
[1:57:33] wonderful time he had with him not long
[1:57:35] ago had lunch with
[1:57:37] him and I've heard so many different
[1:57:39] stories of how and a sister I had no
[1:57:42] idea of this Saturday night we had a hay
[1:57:45] ride for our children and a sister came
[1:57:47] to me and when she recognized brother
[1:57:50] Nathaniel she said you know brother Mike
[1:57:53] it was brother Nathaniel who helped my
[1:57:55] cousin to get to the hospital when he
[1:57:58] couldn't get
[1:57:59] there he was the one that helped him get
[1:58:02] to the hospital and so brother Nathaniel
[1:58:05] has helped hundreds and hundreds of
[1:58:07] people that we will never know
[1:58:10] about and you'll never know what he did
[1:58:12] for those people he gave his life in a
[1:58:15] different kind of a
[1:58:16] way and so as brother na Nathaniel went
[1:58:18] through all these different things and
[1:58:20] helping people like he did the Devil
[1:58:22] comes along and starts planting thoughts
[1:58:24] in your mind why this and why that but
[1:58:27] remind the devil that this man was a Son
[1:58:30] of God and that Son of God stood for the
[1:58:33] word of God that he knew for his
[1:58:35] hour you see I just give you a little
[1:58:38] quick history here and I hope sister
[1:58:41] Carol don't mind and we were we we've
[1:58:44] been you know Sister short used to come
[1:58:46] to y's church and when you were in the
[1:58:49] old building and we would come and visit
[1:58:51] in the early ' 90s 9091 when you were
[1:58:54] there and and sister short I show up
[1:58:56] Sister short would come looking for me
[1:58:58] because my dad was their
[1:59:00] pastor at one time yours too and so but
[1:59:06] when my dad was a young man he had a
[1:59:07] major
[1:59:09] stroke and he could only move one
[1:59:11] finger and sister Carol was telling me
[1:59:14] that she was a little girl out in the
[1:59:16] front yard when her daddy and another
[1:59:19] Minister was in the in the house praying
[1:59:21] for my dad
[1:59:23] and they asked all the people who didn't
[1:59:25] believe that he would get up to go out
[1:59:26] of the house and my mama told me that
[1:59:28] there was only five people left in the
[1:59:31] house and brother short was one of them
[1:59:34] another brother butd whed was there and
[1:59:37] the sisters I guess was there and just
[1:59:39] in a few minutes completely healed he
[1:59:42] raised up off the bed walked out the
[1:59:44] door and they had lunch for everybody
[1:59:47] that was
[1:59:48] there and now it comes down the road and
[1:59:52] and I'm pastoring sister
[1:59:53] Sue I'm thinking my dad was their Pastor
[1:59:56] years ago and then the real thing was it
[2:00:00] comes along my my grandmother on my
[2:00:02] mother's side brother brother
[2:00:05] short I didn't even know this was her
[2:00:09] pastor she's sitting in brother Schwarz
[2:00:11] and then we go to the to the funeral of
[2:00:13] my grandmother in the house where
[2:00:15] they're having the
[2:00:16] church and we had a Hallelujah meeting
[2:00:19] there they were praising the Lord and
[2:00:21] then I found found out later that in my
[2:00:23] grandma's house she knew the message she
[2:00:25] had the message books I didn't even know
[2:00:27] that and I'm thinking praise the Lord
[2:00:29] Grandma knows the message too and then I
[2:00:32] see these people come along when we left
[2:00:35] Richlands Virginia we didn't know
[2:00:37] nothing about no message we didn't know
[2:00:38] nothing about a prophet but God in his
[2:00:40] divine intervention has brought these
[2:00:43] people together brought it in a full
[2:00:45] circle and this man I got to Pastor him
[2:00:48] for the past three years and see the
[2:00:50] faithfulness of a man who would stand
[2:00:52] for the word of God where he was in his
[2:00:54] in his
[2:00:55] job brothers and sisters we need to
[2:00:59] thank God for each and every one of us
[2:01:01] we're brothers and sisters in Christ we
[2:01:04] need to understand that when somebody's
[2:01:06] sick and as brother Donnie said a few
[2:01:08] minutes ago you may not understand you
[2:01:11] may not been through that trial you may
[2:01:13] not think that way so until you've
[2:01:15] walked in that person's shoes you
[2:01:17] shouldn't condemn them and because they
[2:01:19] made a mistake don't dechristianize them
[2:01:23] because we suffer in many different ways
[2:01:26] how many times you have a service and
[2:01:27] the blessings of the Lord comes down and
[2:01:29] you go out and you think oh God what am
[2:01:31] I going to do how am I going to fight
[2:01:33] the next battle but God looked at us let
[2:01:36] me just continue in verse 5 he says
[2:01:38] having predestinated us unto the
[2:01:40] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[2:01:43] himself you see he was chosen by God
[2:01:47] himself no Pastor chos
[2:01:50] him no person chose but Jesus Christ in
[2:01:54] the fullness of his word verse 6 he said
[2:01:56] to the praise and the glory of his grace
[2:01:59] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[2:02:02] Beloved and verse 7 says in whom we have
[2:02:05] Redemption through his blood as brother
[2:02:08] Andrew reminded us that that Redemption
[2:02:12] God has redeemed us into this word of
[2:02:14] God the redemption's there and we're
[2:02:17] waiting on the change to
[2:02:19] come and he said and here he is is he
[2:02:22] said in whom we have Redemption through
[2:02:25] his blood the Forgiveness of
[2:02:27] sins how mean he's ever made a
[2:02:32] mistake I'm still making mistakes but
[2:02:35] thank God for Grace he looked beyond my
[2:02:38] fault saw my need and pull me out of the
[2:02:42] mar clay and said come on man you can do
[2:02:44] this it's by his grace verse eight says
[2:02:47] and wherein he hath abounded toward us
[2:02:50] in all wisdom and Prudence having made
[2:02:53] known unto us the mystery of his will
[2:02:57] according to his good pleasure which he
[2:03:00] hath purposed in
[2:03:02] himself you have been chosen for his
[2:03:05] good pleasure not yours that's right
[2:03:07] you've come here to glorify him not
[2:03:10] yourself you come here to worship God
[2:03:12] not your pastor not your husband or your
[2:03:15] wife but you come here to glorify God
[2:03:18] because he said it was a mystery and you
[2:03:21] know what many people can understand why
[2:03:23] we follow a message why we follow a
[2:03:24] prophet why we follow the word of God
[2:03:26] why we believe in Jesus Christ Jesus
[2:03:28] Christ says it's a mystery that you
[2:03:31] worship me if you just worship him
[2:03:33] because it's a good idea it's not going
[2:03:35] to help you but when Revelation strikes
[2:03:38] the word in your soul and it changes
[2:03:42] your thinking and it changes your
[2:03:44] expression and it changes your desire
[2:03:47] you know that something's going to
[2:03:48] happen and so he comes along and he says
[2:03:52] having made known unto us the mystery of
[2:03:54] his
[2:03:56] will and I looked up that word mystery
[2:03:58] to see what it said it's a hidden
[2:04:00] thing you know mystery is a hidden thing
[2:04:04] he said it's religious
[2:04:07] secrets so the devil doesn't understand
[2:04:10] it religious people doesn't understand
[2:04:12] it he said it's religious Secrets
[2:04:15] confided only to the
[2:04:19] initiated and not or ordinary
[2:04:23] Mortals so we're not just ordinary
[2:04:26] Mortals we are living under the power of
[2:04:31] the
[2:04:32] supernatural because if Jesus Christ
[2:04:34] lives and dwells in who you are then you
[2:04:37] have the power of the Holy Ghost living
[2:04:40] inside of you that's the
[2:04:41] supernatural power of God I can't say
[2:04:45] much more about this man because he's
[2:04:47] did his own testimony he's preached his
[2:04:49] own life he's told us what he's going to
[2:04:51] do and he serve God to the best of his
[2:04:53] knowledge but God said in this mystery
[2:04:55] it's to the initiated so when God
[2:04:58] initiates you to be a real believer the
[2:05:00] devil cannot take your soul from God
[2:05:04] because he says when you're sealed
[2:05:06] you're sealed until the day and God's
[2:05:10] power is walking and living and
[2:05:12] breathing in human flesh today listen we
[2:05:15] were created in the image of God Genesis
[2:05:18] chapter 1 and he comes down he says and
[2:05:20] we were created in the image of God what
[2:05:22] was the image of God it was a
[2:05:25] spirit the first part was a spirit realm
[2:05:28] it was an image you that don't know
[2:05:30] Jesus Christ this will be the last time
[2:05:32] you see brother Nathaniel but those of
[2:05:35] you who are born again by the same power
[2:05:37] and The Same Spirit when he rises again
[2:05:41] in the resurrection we shall see him for
[2:05:44] we shall be like him will be changed in
[2:05:46] a moment in the twinkling of an eye but
[2:05:48] you that don't know this Jesus Christ
[2:05:51] you that's not been initiated by the
[2:05:52] word of God you'll never understand why
[2:05:54] we worship God why we praise God you say
[2:05:57] but you're crazy with your religion
[2:05:59] that's all right we know why we're this
[2:06:01] crazy because the world don't know where
[2:06:04] we are they can't see this because
[2:06:07] they're not initiated to see it but if
[2:06:09] God initiated you then you ought to
[2:06:11] serve him with all your heart brother
[2:06:13] Nathaniel did the best he could and God
[2:06:16] accepted his best when you've done the
[2:06:18] best that you can God accepts that's
[2:06:21] good enough
[2:06:22] he don't expect you to live like who the
[2:06:24] pastor is or a deacon or somebody but he
[2:06:27] wants you to live to the ability that
[2:06:29] you see the ability that you've received
[2:06:32] and that's what he's going to that's
[2:06:33] what he's going to measure You by if you
[2:06:35] try to live to the standard of a
[2:06:37] Preacher he's notable to tell you the
[2:06:38] wrong thing to do but when you live to
[2:06:40] the standard of the Holy Ghost then he
[2:06:42] will let you know exactly how he's going
[2:06:44] to take care of you so it doesn't matter
[2:06:47] how low you feel or how high you feel or
[2:06:49] what you feel God's not looking at your
[2:06:51] feelings he's looking at the purchase
[2:06:54] price of the blood of Jesus Christ and
[2:06:56] here is the purchase price and one day
[2:06:59] we're going to see that man Rise Again
[2:07:02] those of us who are waiting for this
[2:07:03] Rapture we're going to be standing there
[2:07:05] and saying praise God thank you brother
[2:07:07] Nathaniel because when the dead Saints
[2:07:09] arise sister Sue when he comes walking
[2:07:11] through the door you'll know it's time
[2:07:13] to go home we're just getting ready to
[2:07:15] crossover friends we are getting do you
[2:07:17] not see the world and the turmoil that
[2:07:19] it's in and what the devil's doing and
[2:07:21] how much Rule and reigning he's got into
[2:07:23] the politics listen friends we know by a
[2:07:26] prophet's message we are getting ready
[2:07:28] to cross over are you ready this man was
[2:07:31] ready I say let's stand together in the
[2:07:35] power and the authority of the word and
[2:07:37] let God be God and lead us and guide us
[2:07:39] that was his promise it ain't just your
[2:07:42] pastor preaching it ain't just somebody
[2:07:44] else but when he says I'll lead you and
[2:07:46] I'll guide you that's his promise and if
[2:07:49] he gives you the promise then he's a ble
[2:07:51] to keep every
[2:07:53] promise so
[2:07:55] today if you don't know this initiated
[2:07:59] power of the Holy Ghost I ask you don't
[2:08:04] condemn me if you don't know why I live
[2:08:08] it why don't you go look at the mirror
[2:08:10] because you're your biggest
[2:08:12] problem right every one of us that's our
[2:08:15] biggest problem look in the mirror I am
[2:08:17] my biggest problem I give myself the
[2:08:19] hardest time I know the issues I know
[2:08:22] who I am and I look at the grace of God
[2:08:25] and say thank you Lord that you chose to
[2:08:29] love
[2:08:29] me you chose to raise me up and let me
[2:08:33] see you and because he did
[2:08:39] that I didn't want to be a
[2:08:41] preacher I didn't want to be a pastor
[2:08:44] but if I'm going to be it I want to have
[2:08:47] compassion I want to show you love I
[2:08:49] want to show you that the god I I serve
[2:08:52] as real and if you'll just let him come
[2:08:55] in and just come in that meekness of his
[2:08:57] Spirit he'll change this Mortal body he
[2:09:00] said that he will
[2:09:02] Quicken this flesh he'll Quicken this
[2:09:05] Mortal body and he'll change you to
[2:09:09] serve him tonight we worship the Lord
[2:09:12] God we praise him for all that he's done
[2:09:14] for us sister
[2:09:18] Sue how's he going to do it
[2:09:22] by his
[2:09:26] grace how did how did brother Nathaniel
[2:09:30] get
[2:09:33] here in Ephesians chapter 1 he said he
[2:09:35] knew us before the foundation of the
[2:09:37] world so it wasn't because of his mom
[2:09:39] and daddy that he's
[2:09:40] here it was because of the Lord God saw
[2:09:43] him in his mind before the foundation of
[2:09:46] the world sure his parents B birthed him
[2:09:49] into the world but they couldn't it
[2:09:51] without God ordaining it to happen
[2:09:54] that's the power of our God brothers and
[2:09:56] sisters
[2:09:57] please know that we love you know that
[2:10:01] we love brother
