birth of how he grew into a man and the way he lived his life but what moved me deep within my heart was why he had to [Music] die no orary baby child was laid within that hay the savior of the world was born I heard the preacher say there's a way in the manger for those who are lost there's a way in the manger and it leads to the Cross now as an Noble servant he left his father's side to be laid in a Manger where the animals abide the scene within that stable which shows how we must come humbly as a little child to know the Father's son I'm not making light of Christmas God bless Nativity but what lead us to Heaven is the road to [Music] calary there's a way in the manger for those who are lost there's a way in the Mainer and it leads to the Cross yes there's a way in the manger for those who are lost there's a way in the manger and it leads to the [Music] [Applause] cross for [Music] some are known by great Authority from kingdoms as far as eyes can see in Royal robes they rule from Thrones waging Wars they overthrow the weak and call it [Music] Victory my king is known by Mercy my king is known by grace for the Hope in his name and the power that saves my king is known by the [Music] cross my king is known by an empty grave in all that he does my king is known by [Music] [Applause] I can almost see him even now rejected with thorns upon his brow what kind of king would leave his throne and make my sin and shame his own but he gave his life for me he gave his life for me my king is known by Mercy my king is known by grace for the Hope in his name and the power that saves my king is known by the cross my king is known by an empty grave in all that he does my king is known by love [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] my

him it's Christmas and like brother Dave said a while ago it's it's one thing about Christmas it seems to get even old grumpy grouchy people they they'll be nice to you a little bit for a few days any anyway it's one good thing but I'm glad that we know the truth about Christmas it wasn't December 25th or whenever but he came and that's the most important thing I've been listening this week too we would see Jesus a Christmas message brother BR preached I think it's 61 but he said when the Greeks came to him he didn't Point him to his birth he pointed him to his death that was the price Let's uh this course that they just played there let's sing this he knew me yet he loved me this great king whose Glory makes the heaven shine So Unworthy of such Mercy yet when he was on the cross you and I were on his mind [Music] I'm not long an e trip I'm [Music] nothing on my own I make mistakes and often slip just common flesh and but he'll prove someday just what I say I'm of a special kind for when he was on the cross I'm glad that I was on his mind [Applause] for he knew [Music] me yeah he Lov me for he glory is the heaven shine so word oh they sing it now of such Mercy thank you Lord God

praise the Lord praise the Lord I pray that you have already received the true and only and original Christmas gift it wasn't laid under a tree but tacked on one so that you and I could be free we so appreciate that today don't we Let's uh bow our heads together pray over the word I wonder how many has a need and request on your heart today God bless each of you um brother Carter Lawson has a brother-in-law that's really really sick and he wanted us to remember them today I'll be preaching with a prayer Coss for that need too so Heavenly Father we know through this ceaseless ages we will still be praising you for the great love of of redemption that you've expressed to each of us we know when we get there there'll be no buying selling trading there'll be no carpentry work there'll be no repair work there'll be no dental work there'll be no hospitals there'll be no surgeons what in the world we going to do for eternity we will be worshiping praising adoring loving serving you I can't wait Jesus but I know one thing for sure I don't want to wait till my glorified feet touch the streets of gold for the first time before I praise you I going to praise you every day of my life yes you saw the hands that were uplifted father signifying needs desires petitions we are on our journey still yet and we have sicknesses and disease and troubles along the way we ask you father that you would just help us in our journey Lord Brother Cal Lawson's brother-in-law you see this desperate need that he has today Father we're asking that you'd be mindful of him we have many in our assembly Lord that have different needs and requests and would you help us today Lord we still are mindful of the flood victims up in Tennessee and Western North Carolina Lord many of them still with no home to go to Lord I've been thinking about them so much since it's got cold and what they're going to do how they're going to survive Lord and I saw a thing the other day where over a 100,000 homes had been either destroyed or damaged by all that stuff so we pray that you'd be mindful I know people called it a Act of God but we know it was not our God that did such a thing but we know it's the prince of the power of the air and one day the last hurricane will spin its last time there'll be no more storms Lord Jesus we're waiting for that day help us today as we look into your word we pray father in Jesus name amen God bless you Saints let's turn to u 1 Corinthians chap 11 if you would today greet you today in the name of the Lord Jesus what a privilege it is for us to once again be gathered together in his house I want to speak to you again today by the help of the Lord on the right to be in divine order 1 Corinthians 11:34 If any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto to condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come so the first church was not only a supernatural Church A Gifted Church in the book of Acts but they were also a church that had problems troubles issues the very reason that deacons were called in the book of Acts was not to hand out gifts deacon were not called to minister so much in the same realm as the preachers were but to be able to help the needs of the people and I I think that each of us are aware of that already but I trust we never lose sight of that that church is not just about signs wonders and miracles while we're here but it's us taking this same gospel and letting people see the love and the life of God liveing us when we're out there every day 1 Corinthians 14:40 let all things be done decently and in order and the word is taxi and arranging Arrangement a fixed succession observing a fixed time doe or right order or orderly condition post rank or position which one holds in Civic or other Affairs and since this position generally depends on one's talents experiences resources character fashion quality and style so there was not only a spiritual aspect of the church but there was also a natural aspect there's an element of Christianity Today that believes that church has no order to it that there's actually no such a thing really as pastors and deacons and trustees and Ministry that people just you know they're in in Christ socalled and they do whatever they want to do you don't have to go to church you don't have to do really anything at all and they think that's the Bible that is Antichrist is what that is if you knew your Bible very well you'd know that the church had elders and pastors and deacons and all those sort of things God is a god of order is he on Colossians chapter 2 verse 5 for though I be absent in the flesh yet am I with you in the spirit joying and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ may the Lord bless his words you may be seated if you don't mind I'd like to um read to you again the um um the couple of paragraphs here of the Prophet seeing the great constellations and the heavens and looking up in the night sky and seeing seeing things that he saw beyond what man could see of course and he said somewhere in time I pointed out to me one time in an observatory the Zodiac showing notice this now beginning with the Virgin coming over through the cancer age on down to the last was the lion Leo the Lion the first coming of Christ by the Virgin the second coming by the line of the tribe of Judah and I said I've tried my best to see that zodiac and I can't see it but yet it's there those who are trained know it's there job saw it man used to look at it it was a Bible at one day but in that great whole great mass of millions and billions of Lighty years and I remember at this time frame they were only seeing 120 million years of light space so how is it that he was talking about billions of years of light years God sits in the midst of his all and he looks down Paul is in there my mother's in there somewhere looking down and I thought of the order of that Heavenly Host not one of them's out of place every one of them's kept time perfectly God's Great Army I mean know that even the way that science has become more advanced today that they're able to look at that pattern and they've already got it charted and the time of when the next uh lunar eclipse will be and when the next eclipse of the sun will be and they already have it out charted for several several years when the next meteor shower will come through we had one just this past week if you saw it and they've known that for many many years now how can they know it because it's all set in a pattern Galileo whenever he was studying many many years ago and those who looked at the stars and they saw that there was a repeat now you know every Star is not in a constellation but some are forming a big pattern out there in the universe and you don't see them at every thousand years or maybe every 2500 years but yet they're still in a flight path so they only become visible every now and then and then there's certain ones that are meteors which are nothing but just spinoff of a planet I hope and pray to God that every person under the sound of my voice today actually belongs in a Divine constellation and you're not just a piece of space junk and you're just flowing around now you realize that because of what man has done through the years by rocket Chambers and by satellites that there's all types of what they call space junk in the universe so when once it gets up in there then it falls into the pattern of where it goes around the paths of the earth some of them in time will start dropping down and then whatever it does it'll burn and expose it comes down through the Earth's universe and God did it that way or the Earth's atmosphere rather so that it would be able to protect the Earth but truly we don't desire to be those types of Christians do we to where we just float here and there we have no goal no purpose no motive in life we're just here today and we're there tomorrow and we're there next week then we're there over there next month but I desire myself I trust you do to have a place in the body of Jesus Christ now I don't desire a great place and never have I don't want a big this and that and the other I just desire a position whatever that is that's fine with me now the prophet saw this and he could see that that zodiac it reflected a story and he called it a pattern I thought of the Soul soers how if that Moon would happen to get out of order the Earth would be covered again with water in just a few minutes now we know in the and deluvian destruction which was in the days of Noah that it wasn't just that all of the sudden that these great massive rainclouds started gathering in the sky and something started happening but it was an event that was identified in the heavens I want you to know notice a prophet that he actually picks it up here that the flood on the Earth was identified was also something that happened in the heavens now what was it that happened in the heavens you see such a catastrophic flood could have never happened as long as the moon would have stayed in her designated order but God had to allow the moon to be moved out of her designated order for a season and when God created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void in darkness covered the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God divided the light from the darkness and the light he called day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day now this is why the Hebrews still to this day they actually called the beginning of a new day the evening of another one so this afternoon Sunday evening the Hebrews will identify the beginning of Monday at the close of Sunday afternoon so the way we are looking at it the seventh evening in the seventh Church age is actually the dawning of a brand new day and the evening and the morning will be the seventh day so God had to have something to happen to the Moon before this great catastrophic flood could come upon the Earth and then the Bible goes on to tell us in the Book of Genesis that The Fountains of the deep broke up so God had allowed a great great mass of water down in the what is called the aquifers which are beneath the Earth surface and they're still there and we're still pulling water from there so God allowed them to break up and when they broke up then Water started oozing out of the bowels of the Earth but of course there was also rain clouds and they started moving and then the Earth was under the influence of the Moon moving back out of her cycle somewhat and turning her back in order for the tidal waves to start coming upon the Earth as well so the Earth is being inundated from the heavens from within itself and also from the power of the Moon which turned its back now keep in mind that we're talking about the Bible being written in the stars so what's going to happen in the last days you see people just look around and say well it's church is normal we've done this for how many ever years it's going on like it always has oh no you see when God takes the bride from the earth the bride's back will be turned upon the Earth the blood will be lifted from the earth The Mercy Seat will be vacated all hell will break loose the chief demon the head demon would have already become incarnate in the pope and he's only waiting for the bride to be gone and when she is lifted then Satan will be cast out of Heaven he'll come down on the earth and then it will begin what he's desired for all of these thousands of years it will all be linked together again now it's God's Great Army is what brother Ram called it and when I thought about that being God's Great Army there now we went to bed and I begin to think that not one of those get out of their place they're all set in place and if there's a moving anywhere of them it's for a cause and will affect the Earth so the Earth is time not only with Mars and Jupiter but also with the sun and with the moon so this event that happened there in Noah's day was a an event that was written in the sky so if we can look and see that by God's grace that the stars are still where they need to be if we could see on the earth that the army of God is finding their place and getting where they need to be not not only in the mystical invisible part but also in the human part the local assembly you see it's not just you and I finding our place in Christ Jesus that's just a copout for a lot of people and they said well I'm in Christ well if you are in Christ you'll get in Christ's local assembly as well amen that's right if you believe all he said now I thought then if that great Heavenly Host like that has to keep its place to make thing in order what about the disorder of the Earthly host how when one gets out of order how it throws the whole thing out of cater the whole program of God is upset when one member gets out of order we should continually to strive to keep the order of the spirit now every one of us then that today are in Christ Jesus and some of you that maybe you're not actually in there yet in the mystical part but you're on your way and me know there's steps to coming into the body of Christ justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost so let's jump now to that last part which is when we're really in the mystical part so after we're sealed in Christ Jesus our soul is a secure as the Lord God himself Satan can no longer touch our soul but our bodies and our Spirits are still subject to the influence of demons and darkness that are around us our bodies subject to sickness our Spirits uh can be down and distraught and all that sort of thing but our soul is sealed in the spirit of God for our lives are HID with God in Christ now watch in 1 Corinthians 12: 13 Paul said for by one Spirit are we all baptized in to one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been all made to drink into one Spirit now what I'm going to describe to you first is the mystical part that's the part that's invisible now in the mystical part today people have already gathered in South Africa New Zealand Australia all over the continent of Africa they've gathered in somia they've gathered in you know the islands in the in the Pacific in Asia they've already gathered because they're ahead of us in the time frame and know we will never see many of those people but we are all in one body in Christ Jesus but yet God did not just want it to be the supernatural mystical part but he wanted to continue his work on Earth the same way he started his work and that was he started a church and the first one was the church at Jerusalem now after the the church becomes established a little bit then James becomes the first pastor of the church now Peter is an apostle so Peter's going out with the Keys of the Kingdom he goes to the Jews he goes to the Gentiles and then Philip goes to the Samaritans and the church body starts growing so they're focusing on two things the mystical part get them in to Christ Jesus then once you get them into Christ Jesus then a St start establishing churches why so they can have a place to go where God can continue his work the apostolic view is going to be the apostles will go out and they'll start new works believe it or not we still have end of the message and that's what their call is they go into communities and God will burden their heart and they'll start a work they may stay there a year or two or three then they feel to leave and they'll go somewhere else that church will get a pastor and it continues to grow and go that's the way God established the church notice 2 Corinthians 5:17 therefore If any man be in Christ now you can be in the local assembly today but yet not be in Christ but if you're in Christ then there should be something in you that you want to come together with the rest of your brothers and sisters and fellowship and worship and be around those that are of like Precious face and the church says amen therefore If any man be in Christ Jesus he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are new Galatians 3:27 for as many of of you that have been baptized into Christ into Christ now remember I baptize you in water or some of these others baptized brother brothers in water and that's only to baptize you into the fellowship and you're taking on the name name of the Lord Jesus but no preacher can baptize you into Christ Jesus only he himself but as many of you have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ now remember the mystical part again put on look at the word put in Duo and clothed with clothed in to sink into closing so then a person that is baptized by the Holy Ghost into the mystical body what they've done they have sunk into new clothes so their soul sunk into the baptism of the Holy Ghost so in their soul every one of us here today that that have got the Holy Ghost our soul has sunk in to new clothes which is Christ Jesus in the mystical Body of Christ there's never been one argument there's never been one disagreement in the mystical Body of Christ no preachers debate with each other in the mystical Body of Christ no preachers argue no deacons argue no people argue Mom and Daddy don't argue nobody argues in the mystical Body of Christ is that right why it's not allowed that's it's not allowed but in the local assembly there's difference of opinion and there's argument aren't you glad one day we're not just going to be made new but all them Oddities that every one of us have are all going to be changed as well and that's what causes us our problems and that's the very reason that Satan wants to do that is in order to say well you know ever church I've been to I've got hurt and let me give you a heads up if you if you go to 500 more you're going to be hurting all 500 of them because you got human beings there and we're going to hurt one another but it's the same way at Walmart it's the same way at the gas station it's the same way everywhere you go just grow up and put your big boy britches on and know that's the way it is and God is not offering us you know this Cocoon of his Divine love and mercy and everybody's going to walk around our feelings forget it it ain't going to happen that way well praise the Lord now watch this again in Ephesians 1:3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ notice again this is the mystical part in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace where he has made us accepted in the Beloved I love these two words that the prophet put together and he called it the mystical body now I won the first one of course to use them theologians have used them for many many hundreds of years but he really put an emphasis on it and he said the real church is the mystical body of Jesus Christ now you cannot organize the mystical Body of Christ now every person that comes to Christ comes out of the world comes into Christ comes into his mystical body and you're a member of that body when you're brought into this church called out and are baptized into this mystical body notice what he said you get it how many gets it you understand so that's the part that we're want to point you to it's much easier to be a part of Word of Life Church just by coming and say well I want to come to church here well you're welcome to come here if that's what you feel you want to do but we don't want you to stop there we don't want you to just come and say well I come once a week or twice a week and I support the church and you know I believe they're good people and all that that's not not what our goal is our goal is to get you into the mystical Body of Christ and then you find where God put you in your constellation and then there and look I've said it before anybody that's moved here knows that if they' talked to me before they moved here I tell people the exact same thing and I've done it for decades I want you he if God wants you here if he doesn't I don't because you will not be happy you will be unhappy you'll not be satisfied and you'll be complaining about this and griping about that but you need to pray about where you need to go to church and if this is where God wants you then we welcome you with all of your flaws and all of your issues cuz there ain't nobody here today that don't have them including the man preaching to you is that right but yet God know that this would be part of the problem when he had a body now humanly wouldn't it just be easier in one sense of the word that everybody is baptized into the mystical body and then you just go your own way you create your own Planet you create your own world and you just live there away from everybody else nobody's mad nobody's upset nobody has any problems and how's the gospel going to grow from planet to planet is you're creating one and then you know God knew exactly what he was doing but he knew it would be issues among them same with Ministry God knew knew that preaching would be one of the greatest tools that Satan would use to Dam people to Hell well come on God knew that preaching would be one of the most damnable things that would be associated with the gospel of Christ but he also knew by if you don't hear you can't hear without a preacher and how can he preached lest he be sent so the way God looked at it he deemed it absolutely necessary and essential though Satan would use it the same way with church well people say well I've been to so many churches and I'm looking and I'm searching for a church and I I I'm looking for one you know that whatever they think a church is going to be and they've been here and they've been there and they've been somewhere else why there's something in people and they're looking and searching and we didn't realize it we are not called to be everybody's church is that right but now notice how the prophet is and goes on in this same message five identifications of the Church of the Living God if you haven't listened to this while it do you good to listen to it when a man or woman is called into the mystical Body of Christ by the Holy Spirit they become a full member of his body when they're filled with the Holy Ghost because God took the spirit out of Christ raised up his body placed it at his throne and sent back the Holy Spirit to make up the mystical Body of Christ which will be United at the marriage supper at the coming of the Lord you can't organize it it is a mystery you can't organize it it is a mystery now what the devil wanted man to do is replace this mystical part and by preachers Through the Ages just convince people all they have to do is accept him as Savior now they accept him as Savior he does away with their sins and then they belong to the church they put their name on the church book and then of course they're going in the Rapture when they die they're all going to heaven but Satan knew that if he could use the mask of the local assembly and have them not to point toward 1 Corinthians 12 by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body so then he uses again this tool called Ministry and then they convince everybody when you accept Christ as Savior you received his Spirit Well I agree you do receive a portion of his Spirit but you're not filled with the Holy Ghost yet right is that right that's exactly right so he does not lead them on then of course to the mystical part I hate to say it this morning but I got to there's people around the message it's exact same way they they left their Baptist Church or denominational church we give them a bunch of books and a bunch of tapes and they change their Doctrine they start believing serpent seed they start believing this and that and the other that's why we've got so much confusion and Division in our own move why they've never been in in Christ Jesus yet okay amen now watch this in the saman church age but the body of Jesus Christ is not an organization the body of Jesus Christ is a mystical body it's a body and a kingdom that's a spiritual Kingdom that set upon the Earth by Jesus Christ being the king of this Kingdom the high priest notice to offer sacrifices for the wayfaring in this Kingdom he's the prophet the word that preaches the truth and brings the light of God in his kingdom he's both Prophet priest and King in his kingdom and how do we get in this Kingdom by the denomination by letter by hand shaking by one Spirit we're all baptized into this one body which is the mystical body of Jesus Christ oh how many is in it today aren't you grateful so then it's a mystical Kingdom the bottom part of this quote it's a mystical kingdom of God that's set up then we come into it by the Holy Spirit baptism now you see this is where so many of the message folks that don't believe in going to church is where they're missing the last half of the Kingdom age because what they emphasize oh we're in Christ we're in Christ we're in the message so we just stay home we don't need to go to church but they're missing what he's doing right now is setting up a natural Kingdom on the Earth which is forerunning the Millennium you say what are you talking about Brother Don what we're here today we are part of the forerunning of the Millennium we've gathered in the house of God you mean we are here today yes we are here to let hands on the sick we're here to preach the gospel we're here to cast out Devils praise the Lord what is this this is a reflection of the coming Kingdom in the Millennium and he doesn't just want the iCal part he wants it to be a city set on a hill that the world can be able to know that there is a resurrected Savior and that's what breaks your heart it's so sad that Satan has been able to accomplish that in our own ranks and convince so many people that there's absolutely no need of gathering together so the only kingdom of God they project is the mystical aspect and yet that's so contrary to the original founding of the original Church now he says in Blasphemous names the church is the mystical Body of Christ born of the Breath of God did you get it the Church of God is born of the breast of God God breath god notice this God breathed breaths in the nostrils spiritually of Adam and he became a living Soul you understand that's what happened to you when you receive the Holy Ghost the same Lord God that breathed into Adam breathes the breath of of eternal life into your soul that old nature laying there that seed of God laying there dormant maybe for decades and at the time of your birth the Breath of God breathed into your soul and your soul for the first time caught the breaths of life like a baby does when it comes out of its mother and your soul maybe one in the sense of like that because God breathes a breath of life into your soul and you become a new creature in Christ Jesus Oh My did you know the Pentecostals of the true Pentecostal church is born of the Breath of God hey friends how many real true Pentecostals today I ain't talking about organization now now watch and so we're in the spiritual aspect the mystical part and we could go on that for a long time but list let's change for just a bit so in that we're baptized there by the Holy Ghost and then the spirit of God positionally places us not only in Christ Jesus in the mystical part but he also gives us a position in his body on the earth now if Satan realizes he can no longer pull your soul out from under the shadow of the wings of the almighty then he will changed his tactics and his Focus as he did in the original church he he wasn't aware of what the Lord Jesus was doing in the first months and years even when a church is birthed on the earth because the Lord Jesus is the first one in the New Testament to use that word Church Upon This Rock I will build my church imagine what the devil thought whenever the Lord Jesus used this word the first time nobody else use it so he had to wait to try to figure out so what is a church I don't understand what is a church I I don't understand what a church is I don't know what it is so he had to watch and see what happened so he watched on the day of Pentecost and still The View was not quite plain yet he saw that they received something and they were different and then they started Healing The Sick and then they started growing growing so they were going through the birst Spains but he still didn't know what a church was and then mainly it was all Jews and then the spirit of God started reaching beyond the Jews and calling to the Gentiles and Satan and his demons are still watching they're learning they're trying to figure it out so what's this word church what's he mean he's going to start a church remember the Old Testament was totally different from that so how are they going to do what are they going to have a type and a shadow well God mirrored that actually in Jerusalem whenever he chose Jerusalem is a place for his name so God showed that there was a special place of worship so if you live down on the southern part of Israel and you live down next to the Dead Sea and yet you needed to make an atonement for your sin guess what you'd have to do in the day of yam Kapur you would have to go go all the way either by Ox cart by foot or if he was a rich man by a donkey you would have to go all the way from the right down at the bottom of the Dead Sea and go all the way up to Jerusalem many many miles away you couldn't just go there to the Dead Sea you couldn't if you was in the northern part and you live near the Mount Hermon you could not just offer your lamb there there was only one place God would receive a lamb and that was the place he chose to put his name which was Jerusalem so God was mirroring a time that there would be a place on the earth that he would receive the worship so on the day of yam Kapur Here Comes people from the north Here Comes people from the west from the east from the south what are they all coming for there's only one place God will receive their sacrifice and that's in Jerusalem so there was a mirror but it was so vague in the Old Testament they couldn't make it out now you imagine if Satan started watching this and then the church started growing and then they started trying to figure out so what are we supposed to do and then they started having meetings together remember in the Old Testament they didn't do that they would just go to bring their atonement and they would go up to the synagogue and they'd discuss the Torah and they would talk about it but they never actually gathered together like that so they started Gathering and then first thing you know Paul said when you come together start singing spiritual songs and hymns so they thought wow well that's what David and and the and the Levites did in the Old Testament and what what about ASAP remember ASA was one of the chief musicians of the Old Testament and he actually wrote many of the Psalms and there was several of the Psalms that was dedicated to him but it wasn't quite put together like in a church surface even in the dedication of the Solomon's Temple they all gathered together and they was there for several days and they prayed and they worshiped and they sung but they didn't know what else to do church was totally new so then Paul said when y all come together they said some's got a Psalm some's got a song some's got a hymn so you imagine that they started coming together and say well maybe we can sing one come together and maybe we can just start kind of worshiping the Lord as we come together and then you know the the recorded parts of history that go back say that they would come together and then the leader which of course we call the pastor today he would get up in the discourse they would start preaching and start talking and then the people maybe would sit there real quiet because they didn't know what you're supposed to do in church and then eventually some of them started saying amen I think some of y'all don't know what we're supposed to do in church I I guess some of y'all still learning right after 60 years you're still learning well what are we supposed to do we go to church amens are are part of it praise the Lord even seek them helps every now and then get him get him Fritz but it was so new I know this is striking you odd right isn't not somebody you never even thought of this before in your life but yet this is what was going on now then Satan once he said oh I I see I see so is there only going to be one of these well were there just since it's in Jerusalem and this was God's chosen place for his name so will everybody then have to come down here to be in church well even the disciples themselves are playing it by ears we say because they didn't know exactly which way to go and the spirit of God had started growing them and there would be a family over here then another family and then Paul would go up this direction that direction and the next thing you know the light was exploding and then they would come and they begin to tour islands like creit and 100 small cities or something like that from the northern part and then Paul had to be called off to another mission field and then he tells Titus he said I left thee there in Titus that thou might set us in things they ordered that which is lacking now those all types of people got converted but they still didn't have no churches form yet well why didn't they just leave them in the mystical part because they knew growth would come about stability of having a church where people can come and the prophet used it either way flip it back and forth and he called it a home church and also a church home so a place to where they could come and be refreshed and they could fellowship and they can meet well by the time it starts now for a few years and me Luke's wri in the book of of Acts then he look back and they see how the church has been given birth and then ministers start coming in and then as a said earlier they started realizing there was natural needs in the body and the the disciples said it's not right that we should leave the word of God and that we should take care of tables because the widows and some of the orphans are not being taken care of so what did they do they come up with deacons and then they start coming up with the scripture requirement of a Deacon's office and then they were to help with the body you don't need deacons in the mystical body deacons don't weigh tables in the mystical body you understand what are the office of the deacons for brother doubt it's for the local assembly so look what God is doing he's running the two parallel you understand what it'll be the kingdom of God children it will never come in the Millennium until the kingdom of God becomes so established in our hearts not the heart of the Lord in our hearts and we come to our place and our position in Christ Jesus that we are Millennium ready do you understand it's not him it's not him is not the reason that he's delayed is coming it's us it's prophecy it's things in the earth out here and it's us coming to our spot then if it is that important and Satan then begin to realize oh my this is absolutely tremendous tremendous so now demons and they'd have their big meetings down in hell and they'd have to re subdivide them and begin to allocate them differently now you know because they realize you know what this stuff of idolatry and falling down before Asos and baale and all that stuff that ain't going to work no more we're going to have to totally change our tactics we got to watch them you imagine certain demons that was assigned to hang around Paul and you're what Paul preached and then certain demons that was assigned to hang around Timothy and Titus and fimon and some of the other brothers and they would see the strengths of these Ministries and they would see the weaknesses and then they'd try to go in and cause a division and they were able to do it some said I'm of Paul some said I'm of sephus others said I I'm not either one I'm of Christ I don't even believe in going to church so what did Satan do then he started reassigning the demons and the demons started having to learn how to play church let me tell you something you and I are battling demons that have been doing this now for over 2,000 years you better believe they know what they're doing they know oh my they know exactly how church runs they know exactly what to do with division and all that sort of thing to divide among us because they have had a lot of practice at it but I want to tell every one of them here today y'all are older than us you demons have had a a whole lot more time to do this than we have I'm only 68 and some of these people in their teens some in their 20s and you've been disturbing churches for thousands of years but let me just tell you today the hell Squad there is a millennium squad on the earth and not because we are greater but greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world greater is our peace than the peace disturber greater is our joy than the joy disturber greater is our unity in Christ Jesus than all the divisions that the devil can ever start now what Satan wants to do then if he cannot get the soul is to start working on the individuals that make up that body and that move and this is the way he's going to try to do it you see God has a design did perfect will for each of Our Lives yes but Satan also knows there's something called the permissive will now that's the tricky part where actually God will allow certain things and he'll bless it but it's not what he wants for you now listen you see Satan found this out many years ago with Abraham and Sarah was Adam and Eve with balum so this principle he carries over into the New Testament so if he can't stop you from loving God oh I'm I'm I'm consecrated to the Lord I'm going to serve him I'm going to live for him the rest of my life praise God then he'll say all right guys switch over to permissive will so then they start recalculating and looking at your life and trying to attack you not in the mystical part they give up on that already but in the local assembly where you go to church the family you're part of the move that you're part of the message of the hour and try to get you out of the perfect will of God for your life now watch this and does God ever change his mind about his word god permitted Israel to take a law in Exodus the 19th Chapter when Grace had already given them a prophet Pillar of Fire sacrif AC sacrific lamb a delivering power but they cried out for La it wasn't God's will so it was not the will of God to have a Torah on God told Israel I will make you a kingdom of priests but they didn't want that they wanted a law that would tell them what to do what they could do what they could not do and God said all right if that's what you want that's not my choice for you it's not even my will but if that's what you want I'll give it to you and I'll go ahead and bless you in it I tell you friends this is when it becomes so difficult right here because people can move directly out of the perfect will of God for their lives and and the way they will measure it is by he's blessing me we get results don't we now listen he says it's best to have God's will that's what he's taught us thy will be done thy kingdom come thy will be done we must submit ourselves to his will and his word don't question it believe it don't try to find a way around it just take it to way way it is so many wants to go around get some other way and when you do you find yourself going on and you find God blessing you well you know what if you want to belong to a church and you want to attend a church They Don't Preach Holiness They Don't Preach the Full Gospel They Don't Preach the opening of the word They Don't Preach none of that at all and you want to go there and you realize there's more and you say well I want to go that I'm going see if God will bless me more than likely he will yeah cuz he's giving you what you want over the top of his word come on preaching I figured this would be quiet but I didn't think it'd be this quiet now what he says you find yourself going on and you find God blessing you but you're working in his permissive will and not in his perfect divine will he permits it as I said but he will not it will not be his perfect will but he'll make it work to honor and bless his perfect will he has a permissive will now there's where the trouble lays we try to work on God's permissive will and he will permit it now you see here that Sarah after God told Abraham that the child would be born through Sarah that would bless the word World Sarah doubted it and I want you to notice it never come by Abraham but by Sarah the female she doubted it and she said take Hagar so God sets forth his original word and say this is my plan right here I want you all to do that it's just something in man's nature that he wants to go around it this way and say I'd rather go this way if you don't mind I really don't see no need in doing all that myself I really don't see the need in doing it and God says okay if that's what you want I want you to go this way I want you to go around that speaker and you say you want to go this way okay go ahead so y'all come over here and you just gather over here and boy we're going to do this I'm telling you why Oh Glory to God hallelujah I feel the Lord glory to Gody boy didn't the Lord bless us mhm yep he sure does scary huh but you see people get in their mind that as soon as they live leave the will of God that catastrophe and Chaos strikes them immediately not so sometimes it's years I've seen men make decisions and choices and and it might be 5 years 10 years my mind right now thinking of someone several years ago who sat and talked to me in my office about some certain things that they was going to do they didn't come to ask me for any advice or any counsel they basically just tell me what they was going to do I watched within a little short span of Time how that family started falling apart how it went from worse to worse to worse totally divided the fames to this day so busted apart why because the father made the wrong choice a decision that affected his children his wife oh my Mary mer Christmas everybody I couldn't give you nothing better for Christmas than to try to warn you to stay in the will of God now watch so Sarah says well you know what I see that God keeps saying this about Abraham but maybe it's not coming through me so they go to Egypt Abraham backsides goes to Egypt see a beautiful handmaiden there she picks her up and Sarah gets a revolution it wasn't a revelation from God that's the way God will do it I'll merge Pentecost in with me and that's the way we'll give birth to the supernatural move listen Sarah if God said you're going to bring it you don't need to merge it in with Benny hen we don't need the 700 Club come on somebody we want the perfect will of God Amen oh my so God allowed them to go that way was it his will never never and they are still dealing with that to this very day that choice that they made you understand fathers and mothers choices and things that you do can affect not only your children but your grandchildren and your great grandchildren I've seen it time and time again that people will get hurt by this certain certain family and instead of trying to move beyond that thing they'll hold that in their hearts and they'll pass it to their children and their children and their children do you understand you're going to stand before God for generations of hatred and variance instead of letting that stop with you look friends if anybody's got a right to have a grievance against all of us it would be the Lord Jesus there ain't none of us that's served him with all of our hearts come on there ain't none of us that's been totally free from everything around us and yet what does he do to us forgives us oh my so what would he do try to pull us out of that perfect will of God so this is the perfect will of God for you and I we will pray for those who despitefully use us and we will absolutely hate no one amen we hate sin but we don't hate The Sinner we pray for their poor yeah is that right notice as he changes it now and he goes to balam he said balam used this phony text so I guess bam must have preached and he used this phony text for his own conscience sake because actually he wanted that money and he wanted that dignitary he wanted that he wanted that job he wanted that position to be Lo up to as doctor so and so so he said I I'll try again all at the BMS in the world tonight promised positions popularity my oh my they numb their conscience by them so they numb their conscience by offer of position Lord Jesus speak to us today father because of their denominations they say if you do that out you go and just in case you don't know it that ain't just SE in the denominations that's so in our message if you don't agree with some of our preachers they'll absolutely cut you off they'll have nothing else to do with you you want to know how I know that do you you can't preach our Doctrine says you can't do that doct so and so said this is the way it is now you've got to believe at this way if you stay with us and you know what's so sad that same spirit is right around our ranks so if you don't agree with us 100% we're not even going to call you brother no more I'll tell you one thing I think it's narrow and on down where ain't going to hardly be none of us left just remember Elijah you've got the wrong Spirit on you oh yeah that goes with the Elijah anointing on all right but God had to correct that he said listen boy I've got 7,000 that ain't bowed the knee to bail Elijah thought he was the only one it tends to go with this message well it's only us and our church our four and no more you need to wake up there's people around the world that ain't never heard the name Word of Life Church they ain't never heard the name Donnie Reagan Tim puit Ron Spencer Wayne Lawson but they've heard the name of Jesus Christ and they know that God sent a prophet in the last days and they will be right there with us in the morning of the Resurrection oh my so they numb their conscience let's jump down here to the next paragraph 149 so now remember when he come the second night now here come Dr balum he come the second night with this great celebrity already his conscience dull and numb God let him go now God never changed his mind but God gave him his permissive will go ahead go ahead then but he found out it'll not work God knew that was in balam's heart though he was prophet oh my goodness a prophet a prophet he know how he hated them Holy Rollers he's just going to want to curse them anyhow and God told him not to do it but yet he come wanted to do it so God let him go ahead and God said go ahead women want to say God called them to preach I say go ahead and preach sister I don't know if you've run across it before and the discernments of not but you will find God's Prophet calling women preachers out and say you're you're called to be a preacher or you're a woman preacher rather why it's what she wanted to hear but that don't change the word amen you see friends this is one of the last pulls to the bride things will be shaken before her that are permissive will will we take permissive or do we say no Lord no no we don't want none of that I've done been born that way I've done had enough of that all my life what about the rest of you permissive will ain't going to put us in the Rapture but he wanted wanted to do it again so God let him go ahead said go ahead now remember never changed his mind God never changed his mind about his word but he is a good god and he'll give you the desire of your heart though it be against his will I am so glad that I reached the spot concerning my daughter Erica I wanted her to live so bad but I reached the spot that if it be the will of God if it breaks my heart heart of her daughter's heart of her husband her mother or sister her church family all the rest of you loved ones and Friends so what if God would have granted our desire and said well you all want Erica to live so bad I'm going to let her live and then something terrible happened remember the little stats clap baby brother Brenham told the mother she said brother Brenham didn't I have faith he said sister when God said no you had great faith and he said you know where that baby is now and you can go to her if you bring her back it may not be so so you see God says no sometimes sometimes God says wait a while but the scary thing about it is what if G God gives us what we want so what if those that have gone on and and we say to a premature grave and we say well I don't understand why God took this one and why God took that one sister wonder what if God would have granted you your heart's desire and I was there with you and Scotty in the room the last moments of brother Jim's life and we would have said no God no it's our desire let him live and God would have said I will but it's not my perfect will and something would have happened to brother Jim that would have somehow flawed his character all because of our selfishness come on now it now be careful friends when we're praying I want this I want that I I want to do this I going to do this watch this now Lord Jesus speak to us father God never changes his mind his word he's a good God and he'll give you the desire of your heart though it be against his will look God told Moses you go down there the anointed Prophet you go down there and speak to that rock it's already been smitten Moses went down there in his anger picked up the rod and said you rebels must we Fest you water out of this Rock and Smoke the rock the water didn't come he smoted it again and it come it was against God's will it broke every plan in the Bible Christ had to be smitten the second time Christ was smitten once it broke the whole plan but he gave him his permissive will then after he said see we got water for you yeah I brought it for you you bunch of rebels God said come here Moses come here come up here on top now you've been a faithful servant like the woman with the high heels this is actually told the dream of women wearing high heels and they said they can do everything except for that one thing and he saw his mother saw in the dream and when she went off pitching cuz she was pitching forward screaming into the regions of the Lost what a strange occasion for him to bring it back in here why talking about permissive will oh I can do this I can do that I can do whatever I want to go ahead I'll tell you friends this scares the liver out of me I want to be so careful and what I ask him for I want to be so careful for us as a church it's what we want yes sir our desire what's our desire for our church what's our desire for our community what's our desire and what we're supposed to do what's our desire for the message you see we've already changed Generations several years ago brother Henry green passed some other older men passed and I was seeking God about the time frame that we were in and the spirit of God spoke to me these words it is The Changing of the Guard now you realize I was a much younger man then now I'm a much older man myself brother Tim some of the other brothers now we're the older men around the message before long it'll be another change of the Guard so where's the young preachers of the message going to take it to well our churches still believe in the power of God will they focus on the word or will they want something so bad that's a prophet said in the Harvest Time that Satan might let you prophesy and you prophesy something though it be a million miles off the word but yet so we can say we prophesy that's the most important thing no the most important thing is that it's by the word of God I honestly believe with all of my soul today this is where we are people are getting what they want I don't know about you I am a danger to myself am I the only one anybody else be honest who is your greatest enemy louder you are the greatest enemy that you deal with every day of your life think of what a danger that we could want something so bad and God said here you go and I'll even bless you in it and then we look at the blessing and say see there what I told you see there but yet the word says this and this and this and this and this like the woman with a high heels you climbed and you look over Yonder see the promised land oh Lord he said but you're not going over now watch he Likens this to the women with the high heels and they override the quotes you know and then he brings Moses into the same story but you're not going over you took my permissive will down here at the Rock now why didn't God say oh no no no you broke my word I ain't bringing no water out God went right ahead and brought the water out anyway mother like glory to God I'm a prophet of God I'll tell you one thing I'll tell you I broke that word and God HED me anyhow look at what I am and look at what you are now Moses on the Mountain of God so God carries him up lets him take a tour through the land and said now this is what you could have had but you know what you done you Sanctified yourself that day and made yourself look big and this is what it's going to cost you after studying this I'm going to start praying a whole lot more careful than I've ever prayed in my life it made me realize Brother D that it's a children of God we need to pray like Jesus prayed not my will but th be done if any y'all ever had to deal with some of your young ones this way you don't have to smile nod your head or anything I know you have because you've talked to me about it and you try to tell them and you try to tell them and they won't listen and what what do you do you send them to the School of Hard Knock and you try to tell them and hey I'm trying to tell you no no no no go ahead hardhead that's the way God does with us son go ahead hardhead Lord Jesus you have glorified yourself this is what ministers do when they take a gift and focus it toward themsel and they EMP emphasize me my church my Ministry my my my my my you Sanctified you glorified yourself seeing not me you Sanctified yourself now this is not used in a good complimentary way either he's setting himself apart from everybody else look what I am any you all of this let me hand you my rod Dave let me hand you my rod brother Steve let me hand you my rod let me see you do what I've done ain't none of you can do what I've done glory to God oh Jesus keep me from that thing this ain't just for preachers this morning it's for every one of you every one of you streaming Lord God you didn't sanctify me you didn't keep my original word what I told you to do yet the waters did come you can lay hands on the sick and they recover you can prophesy or speak with tongues a't that amazing it jumps from Moses to this laying hands on the sick prophesying the sick recover but the thing is keep his original word God don't change his mind friend you've got to keep his commission his will oh well that was for the disciples huh we sure don't believe that do we we believe it's for us let me close baam had a gift of faith and could have used it to the perfect original word of God many men on the field today with gifts of healing could do the same thing many men out there people speaking in tongues people prophesying a gift could use it for the kingdom of God you mean to tell me that people can speak in genuine tongues and have a genuine genuine gift of Prophecy and not even be using it for the kingdom of God but they don't do it and God blesses them anyhow and gets the permissive well but for popularity and pleasures and personal gain sold their birth rights as Esau did sold out for an organization sold out like balam did so many are doing today the same thing we know that's right they sell out their birth R home women professing the Holy Ghost wearing shorts men permitting them in the pull pits bobbed haired women in the pulpits paint on their faces religious gowns on the biggest stumbling block the church has ever had sir notice as God said to Bam after he had heard the true cut decision word don't go then he told him actually seen his in his heart what he was to do he gave him his permissive will and said go on go you know what he s well God must change his mind about his word a god messed up God learned more God knows I can help them people then H I'm going to go ahead and go God said go on when you get down there I'll give you Visions when you go down there I'll give you true prophecies cuz I've got a hold of your mouth cuz you have a prophetic gift and you have a gift of faith and it's real and you can do the same thing if you don't want to walk in the truth you can go and have a great ministry certainly you can but you're taking his permissive will you're walking over his word he'll Prosper you but he couldn't curse that people he couldn't do it because every time he started to curse he blessed he couldn't do it but when he come to being prosperous in his achievement he taught those people through through baac to commit adultery yet he grants you permission for you to permit your will a permissive will knowing what's in your heart he knows it well brother R I do so and so and so it don't bother me God blesses me every day I sing in the spirit I dance in the spirit he'll permit it oh my go ahead that's right but what are you going to do I wear shorts I do this don't bother me I know where my faith is in Christ not in what I wear sounds like a modern layer to sin on it don't you tell me God ain't but I'll tell you one thing we have people to come to the altar this and that in the world God says go ahead true brother this will be one of the final phases of separation between bride and church and hate to say it but I might as well go ahead and do it it'll be one of the dividing lines between those around the message and bread on just stand if you can if you can't we'll get ambulances to help get you up let me quot close with this one I've been closing you know how that is you going out you close the door and you stand there and talk and then you close a little bit more and you stand there and talk but God will prosper you while He blesses me I don't doubt that he blessed bam too see certainly he will you walk in his permissive will not his perfect will God don't change his mind cuz he blesses you he blessed his world right out there for 40 years you imagine there's no Walmarts no grocery stores they wore the same shoes for 40 years that been hard to imagine convincing a woman to be able to do that for 40 years would it I mean that excuse me I notice only the brothers are smiling well a few women brother she felt your spirit pulse at that you might as well go and smile she's do see it anyhow God C them boy they can say glory to God these are the same britches I had 40 years ago this is the same tie this is the same shirt and he looks brand new don't tell me God ain't with us but when it come to going in the land only two of them with all them blessings when in that's right Lord have mercy children I love the blessings of God but I don't want just His blessings I want his approval and he approves of his word right Lord Jesus let's jump on down to the bottom of this quote every one of them perished because they never kept his original permissive he says his original will his word they took his permissive way yes sir now we have young people in our church here that are finished Miss maybe this be the last year of their schooling some of are already changed school and they're going to college and you're looking for what you want to be and you're searching about what God wants you to be young people as your pastor let me advise you seek the Lord with all of your heart God what do you want me to do where do you want me to go what vocation what job I I I don't know Lord I don't know what to do you understand you can lose years of Your Life by One wrong choice amen and cause you to lose years of your life and you get on this detour and you go way around over here and then years years later you finally come back to where you got off of and try to resume and you lost two years three years 5 years 10 years whatever it was your sisters that are widows your brothers that are widowers God in his wisdom chose your companion to take them on to Glory but that does not mean your life is over or ended so go to him who took your husband go to him who took your wife and say Lord God what do you want me to do with the rest of my life I feel without a purpose I feel Without a Cause well there's one thing I know for sure God does not want you spending the rest of your life focusing on yourself what you want I want this I want to do that I don't want to be around nobody else no I I know that for sure I may not know what you're supposed to do but I know the spirit of God never leads us to selfishness to focus just on me some of you sisters reach out to one another you've got something in common that the married sisters that have their husbands they don't have they cannot relate to the loneliness that you feel sisters some of the brothers in our church that are wiers reach out to one another be a friend you see if there's any failure I'm afraid that many of us have it's this natural side of the church body oh you pray for the minister you pray for this and you pray why the mystical is where we focus so much but how many hurting people come to our church just waiting for somebody to say a kind word to them and they come Sunday after Sunday or Wednesday after Wednesday and nobody even goes out of the way to welcome them we don't want that kind of reputation in our church you may never be best buddies with them but you're going to spend eternity with them aren't you sure you going to speak to every now and then let them know I don't know that I know you God God bless you it's good to be in fellowship with you let's not just focus on the mystical the great Supernatural body so much of the Epistles in the New Testament are written concerning the local assembly the gifts the issues the problems the healings the Natural Things the orchestration of the body how the ministry should focus how the church should run so much of the word is about such how many loves him with all your heart how many today with all of your heart you want to pray more sincerely about choices you make in life and what you do with the rest of your life now keep this in mind and many of you already know it God many times his will he will not send us where we want to go you want to know how I know that I didn't want to come here I was happy in Kentucky my wife's family is still there part of my family big portion of my family there that little church I started there I was very happy being there I wasn't looking for another church I was happy being there and if I would have know then what I know now he'd have had to whoop me I'm telling you big time to get me to come here if I know how much trouble I was going to get into woo boy I'll tell you one thing I'd have been hard to convince I'm glad he kept a lot of that from me ain't you and if he would have showed me that said I'm not going to give you the choice I said no no thank you sir I I'm really happy where I am right here I'm glad to be here and some of you know the same thing you felt to come here from wher you say Lord have mercy all hell broke loose once I got here well good praise the Lord that means the kingdom of hell identifies you with this ministry you know a lot of times streamers are hitchhikers I'm not saying that to be derogatory now but they're hitchhikers they enjoy the blessings they enjoy this but they don't say here in the local assembly it's not just me that makes these Services what they are it's you it's you you praying for me you pulled it and once they come here many of them say oh brother Donnie my I didn't realize how B he was I said well of course not the devil never identified you with some Ministry but once you come here you're a part of it you got this great big old X all over your back all hell is going to be against you but if God sent you strap on your armor let's go we're going to heaven so he may not send you where you want to go he may not even call you to be what you think you ought to be but the thing of it is do you want his desire or yours I have to be honest with you this morning friend sometimes I wish I was never called to be a preacher much of what I go through in my life has nothing to do with me as an individual it's God's people what I've had to preach things I've had to stand on I'm not a troublemaker people think I am but I'm not it's because they don't know me I'm a peacemaker I love peace I just love getting along with people if you can I'm glad God didn't leave it to my choice CU I would not be standing here today and some of you wouldn't be standing where you are what about it Deacon Brothers some of y'all wouldn't still be deacons you done been gone a long time ago D with a bunch of these sorry people I mean these wonderful blessed holy Saints here some of you here today and you don't even want to be here I know you don't some of you have told me you'd rather be in this church and that church and this state and that state that ain't but half the story I wish You' have win [Laughter] unless of course God wants you here that's then if God wants you here then you won't be happy anywhere else and I won't either because actually we help one another your problems and your issues and my problems and my issues and God knew how to put us together didn't he let's B together if you would I wonder where every head bowed brother Bram said he blessed Israel right there for 40 years what they do married wives raised families kissed the children paid their guys lived a pretty good life would say man that's that's a good believer in this day that's a good Christian and totally in the permissive will of God and not a one of them got to cross over and we don't want to live our lives that way so whether you're a young person today maybe you're just coming into your teens and you're trying to decide you know what you want to be some of you at the dating age I know that and you're praying over a g a girl you're praying over a boy and what what to do and oh seek his face with all of your heart young sister Young Brother maybe some of you in your 40s your 50s maybe you're dealing with some midlife crisis and you don't know who you are you feel weird inside you're changing and you know things that you used to like you don't like no more and things you didn't like you like and you're trying to figure out what in the world's going on with me pray pray and be sure whenever you feel to do something that God isn't just giving you what you want but it lines up with his call how many times have I heard those words I feel led I feel Le it can be some of the most devastating words that people ever say I feel led to do this I feel led to do that I feel led to go here I feel led to do something else check it Friends check it how may like to be remember today for the rest of your life remember the rest of your life is before you today and today is the first day of the rest of your life many of you like myself have made some bad choices oh yeah you've made some bad and wrong choices wrong counsel of others maybe just yourself but may God help us heavenly father I know this is sobering father we're asking you that you would help us Lord being the pastor I know that I'm more responsible than any other individual as far as the individuals go in the church I have a great responsibility to answer for it that day because I can set the tone the direction of our church so if I get off on a tangent on a Siri and I ideology I could use my influence that you gave me not only here in this church but around the world and that's why it scares me so much Lord because I realize one day I'm going to have to answer for all of that God help me help me if they could see me back there in my office before I come out walking back and forth and pacing in my office ringing my my hands and praying and asking you to help me I pray no matter how old I get and how long I've preach that I never get over that all of that responsibility help me that I can use what you've given me to influence your people in the right way Lord Jesus then here it comes down to every man every woman every boy every girl may these parents realize they have the capability of setting their children in a direction of righteousness or if they have bitterness in their heart and grievance against me or a grievance against some other preacher or some other person in the church their children listen to them talk about me their children listen to them talk about whoever else it is in the church their children pick up on that resentment and that attitude then it'll go from d dadd and from Mama down to their boys then if their boys grow up and they become married men and then that other family still comes to the church then they can hand it down to theirs on down on down or we have the capability of stopping it let it stop here Lord Lord Jesus I pray you would help me father as The Shepherd of the Sheep dear God I beg you tonight today I'll get on my face I'll get on my hands and my knees and bow before you on my face and not raise up off of this platform till the Midnight Hour if need be if I want something wrong please don't give it to me may I always have a correct Spirit about me yes that I can be corrected by the word help me Lord not to get so caught up in the Supernatural help me to not get so caught up in whatever it might be that I want it so bad that I'll overstep scripture I'll overstep the teaching of your Vindicated Prophet because I want it so bad and you'll say all right Donnie go ahead I'll bless you in it but it ain't my word no Lord please please Jesus may my heart the hearts of my brothers the hearts of my sisters may it be sensitive towards you Lord God how many here with me today is willing to raise your hand hands before the Lord Lord God be mindful of me God if I want something contrary to your will don't give me my desire correct me Lord correct me no doubt the Lord must have struck Moses heart something must have happened that God tried to delay that from happening as the spirit of God must have struck David's heart that day before he took bash Sheba God is so faithful and the same with us a little funny feeling a question in your mind a little something there as I said several years ago and I heard a preacher as he was talking to me and saying that he felt led to do such and such and so and so he was sitting in a service where I was preaching and he said while you was preaching there today the word it just oh it just so pricked me and I I begin to wonder about what I was what I had in my heart I thought well maybe I shouldn't maybe I shouldn't but then I thought no no no it's just it's just probably me little did the man know you were questioning trying to stop him but he overwrote it went on and brought such chaos and catastrophe oh keep us Jesus Keep Us us Jesus by your grace come let us adore him now as it's already been said this morning here we are at the Christmas season we know Jesus wasn't born this time of the year but it's a time that set aside anyway where people say they come to worship him so while we're talking about giving and all that sort of thing why don't we give to the Lord Jesus the thing he wants more than anything else our will our desires I want the kind of heart desire brother Jim that the Lord Jesus could say to me I'll give you anything you want or ask for because he and I Fellowship so much that he knows I would never ask for anything anything say that would displease him how many wants that kind of heart what if that means he has to take your daughter or your son I heard brother Brown tell it this week that there was a young man and a young woman in his service and they were sitting there carrying on real vulgarly in service well the word he used was the boy was trying to make love to the girl and he said it was disrupting the service and people around him and he said the spirit of God spoke to him and said whatever you say will happen so he had the power of life and death right there if he would have called for it God would have taken their lives in the service so he paused for a few minutes brother Rudy to wait Lord what do you want me to do I I love that what do you want me to do he gave him the say but he didn't know what to do with it that's bride Mater friends oh we want power and it's evident we don't know what to do with it but what we need is that kind of Desire then the Lord can give us the power that we need before the resurrection so he said I forgive them I forgive them and he said that's what he wanted me to say let's worship him together come let us adore him we'll be gathering here again this afternoon 5:30 you're welcome to come back and be with us for whatever it is that they've all worked so hard to get together for us
