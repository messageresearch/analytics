He looked beyond my fault and he fixed whatever was wrong with me. Aren't you glad that you done that for you? How many of you was full of faults? How many of you still a flawed human being, but he's still working on us, isn't he? Give the Lord one more good hand clap of praise. I shall for sing it. [Music] [Applause] Oh, to view the cross. Sing it. [Music] [Music] I won't take but second of each time. I just wanted to thank everyone for your prayers when I went into the operating room. I was laying there in the bed and I could feel the prayers of the saints all over me. And y'all don't know what it meant to me. It meant everything to me. And I just want to thank each and every one of you for your prayers. Uh cuz it was a tremendous help to me. And so let's just take these knees to the Lord in prayer. Heavenly Father, as we come before your throne this morning, we come with praise. We come with thanksgiving. We've come with love in our hearts to you, dear Father, for all your grace and mercy. How gracious you are to each and every one of us. Lord, you're with us when we don't deserve it. You guide us when we don't deserve your leadership. We praise you today, dear Father, from the bottom of our hearts for all that you do for each and every one of us. And we bring before you this morning all these needs of these people, which are many. And Lord, we know that you know each and every one of them. And we know that you're aware of each and every one of them. And Lord, if they didn't want them answered, they would have never wrote them in. So I pray today, dear father, from the bottom of my heart that you go to each and everyone individually and answer these prayers and touch them and let them know that you're with them. Let them you know that you're there to help them. Let them know that you want to be on their side. How we praise you today, dear Father, for all you do for us. How we love you for it. How we thank you for it. And we believe everything that you tell us, Lord Jesus, in your word. For your word is true. And we know that that word will keep us, Lord Jesus, if we'll only believe. And we thank you for faith today, dear Father. We thank you for that faith that you've placed with inside of our hearts, inside of our souls to believe that word. So many people don't understand. So many people don't have that faith. But I thank you for the faith that you've given to each and every one of us this morning. Lord Jesus, we just bring you honor and we give you praise this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. God bless you. Give Brother Greg a nice hand this morning. Praise the Lord. We certainly appreciate Brother Greg and Sister Shirley. They've been here a long long time. Right at 40 years, I believe. And we were just a a great great addition to our They make a good church better, don't they? &gt;&gt; They really do. Give him one more good hand if you would. Praise the Lord. Amen. Now, October is Pastor Appreciation Month. And we want to appreciate Brother Don and Sister Carol this month. &gt;&gt; We appreciate them every month, don't we? We certainly do. That's a card of thanks to Brother Don and Sister Carol. Let's sing that little song together this morning. Aren't you glad that in a world filled with all kinds of situations that our God still reigns? How many of you glad about it this morning? Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." Somebody say, "I'm awake." &gt;&gt; I'm awake. &gt;&gt; Give the Lord another good hand clap of praise. [Music] Our God reigns. Yes. Our God reigns. Oh, our God reigns. Yes, our God reigns.

[Music] [Applause] If y'all would help me sing this song, it's if you asked me if we had just a random conversation, Brother Justin, what's your favorite song? It would this would be my answer. And the longer that I live here, the more that I get more homesick for that land. Help me sing it. [Music] I have seen some pretty towns. Guess you could say that I've been around, but I found no place to settle down. But there is a land. [Music] I am just a pilgrim here. Toiling through this old world of fear. My time to leave is drawing near. I'm going to land. There is a land I'm so homesick for. Oh, I've never seen it before. I've got loved ones waiting on that shore. There is a there and it's not a million miles away or on some far off distant strand. Oh, I'll speed up and slow down. There is a land. Why am I so homesick for just not myself here anymore? I'm longing for that hope. on door and that leads to that land. [Music] So I'll drop my weeping eyes and I'll lift my head toward the sky. Farewell to this old world. Goodbye. I'm going to that land. There is a lamb. I'm so homesick before. Although I've never seen it before. I've got loved ones waiting on that shore. Oh, there is a land and it's not a million miles away or on some far off distance train. I'll speed up and they'll slow down. There is a land. Let's sing that chord one more time. There is a land I'm so homesick for though I've never seen it before. I've got loved ones waiting on that shore. [Music] And it's not a million miles away or on some far off distance. Oh, I'll speed up and slow down. There is a lamb. [Music] [Music] [Music] Who can satisfy ify my soul like you. Who on earth could comfort me? Oh, and love me like you do. Who could ever be more faithful and true? I will trust in you. Yes, I will trust in you, my God. who can satisfy my soul like you only do [Music] faithful and true. I will trust in you. I will trust in you my God. There is a mountain. [Applause] Who is the king, [Applause] victorious warrior and lord of everything. I run my shelter. I redeemer blessed redeemer who reign more faithful and true. Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus. [Applause] [Music] for you. I find myself here. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat. There is a fountain. There is a king victorious warrior and lord of everything. I myself he's the carame. [Applause] I cannot imagine when the millions of voices of the children of God gather in that great today and they begin to sing and worship and praise and the angels of God will just have to bow their heads and back out are the children of the most high begin to sing songs that only they can understand. as we looked at it here Wednesday night, that God actually is using the angels to as they would minister to the saints of God and those that are heirs of righteousness. And yet God is using the church to put on a theater. theater. &gt;&gt; Paul uses the word spectacle that we are a spectacle to men, to the world, and to angels. And the word spectacle is a theater. So God by his grace and mercy is working through our lives and people around the world. And the angels are watching the theater as God does it. &gt;&gt; Wow. because they simply don't understand it. God kept the mystery of redemption from the angels. So much of what is going on and has been going on through the church ages, they're having to watch the people of God and catch it as it's going on. I've often wondered what it must have been like in March of 1963 whenever the lamb is taking the book and opening the seals. Now remember, brother Brandham was not the lamb, but it was the lamb doing it. And the angels for their first time were hearing things they had wondered about and pondered about for thousands and thousands of years. Isn't that awesome? &gt;&gt; God bless you. It's such an honor for us to be gathered together today. Let's turn if you would to second Peter chapter 1 verse two. Hope you're not getting tired of reading these same verses of scripture. No. &gt;&gt; Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. I love this verse here as according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness. and not the world, not sinful pleasure, not things like that, but all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue, whereby given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature. You see, that's where angels miss it. They cannot partake of the divine nature the way you do. Having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. And beside this giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness brotherly kindness. Wonder why that's the last one. Brotherly kindness. Brotherly kindness is the last one before the capstone. &gt;&gt; And to brotherly kindness, charity. I may let them be remembered today as we pray. Me as well. Lord Jesus, we so thank you, Father, that we're able to assemble ourselves together. Lord, as I was over here this week doing some work around the place and standing up there at the playground and just looking down toward our our facility that you've given us and Lord, tears running down my face and just so thankful in my heart that you've let us have a place that we can assemble together and Lord, not only for us but for others have special meetings and different things that we can do to invite friends and brothers and sisters to come and partake with us. We're just so grateful for all that you mean to us. Lord, we pray today, Lord God, that you would help us as we're looking at the building blocks of the tabernacle of God, that which is being worked upon now for a couple of thousand years and the Gentile dispensation. And we know with any building that is being built that there can be visible parts that are done that show such great change. And yet we also know those of us that have built homes and things like that and we've seen construction and once the framing goes up it just seems like it can fly and make such changes. Then the roof. Yes. What great changes. Then when it goes to the inside, the wiring, the insulation, different things, the plumbing, it's in the walls, and you go in and look at it and think, "What have they even done today? What have them sorry guys been doing? They ain't hardly done nothing." I wonder, Lord, if it's not that way with us sometimes in our spiritual building, there's fast parts. There's parts that you do in our lives and it's so noticeable. Yeah. There's other parts that you're doing that no one may not even know anything about it but us. But we know those things are essential. Help us today, Father, as we look into your word in the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen. God bless you, saints. You may be seated. Aren't you glad he's still working on you? &gt;&gt; Yes. Boy, am I glad he didn't give up on me. A long time ago, I'm sure that for each of us, we've not only experienced the grace of God when we were first saved, but we've experienced it many, many times since we got saved because God knows we need it every day of our life. So, godliness means to be like God. But in what way? How can mere mortals which are uh imperfect, flawed and have all kinds of faults and shortcomings even to the even after they become born again. How can they be like God? How could they ever be even expected or for he himself to require them to be like him to be godly or to have godliness in their lives? And yet we know he's not asking us to do anything that is not attainable by his power being inside of us. He's not that kind of a God that would ever require such things that he knew that we could never do. But he also knows that by being partakers of the divine nature, that within itself, just as your mother and father and your family, and some of you probably can look at certain features in your hands, your face, your ears, your nose, whatever it is, and you look just like your daddy, just like your mama, whether you like it or not, it's just the way that it is. And you didn't ask to be that way. You didn't actually choose to be that way, but it was given to you through the mixing of the 23 chromosomes from your mother, the 23 from your father, and then the embedded DNA that is there. It just automatically comes out. Well, we know then by being partakers of the divine nature that there's some things and they'll show up immediately whenever we are born again. Other things, boy, it can take years before we really start seeing them manifested in our life. But that's the greater work because every day we are displaying the mercy and the grace of God as he's working in our lives. And even whenever we think oursel, I'm at a standstill. Anybody ever get there in your walk with God to where you just feel like, you know what, boy? I mean, I was really growing and I was doing this or that, but it's very similar to construction. Once we got the walls up on this place here, the people that passed by, they didn't have a clue, you know, what we were doing on the inside, but there was so much to be done on the inside. Same way with your house, if you ever built one. Same way with the house of God. For many of you, you've already straightened up on the outside. People can look at you, see your hair, clothes you wear, things that you do. And some of you may not look one bit different right now than you look 20 years ago or 25 years ago, except maybe a little bit fatter and a little bit uglier. Other than that, you know, you look the same. As you as you increase in size, your dress sizes get bigger. Excuse me. There and you know those things on the outside. But what about the inside? What about the inside? And you see that's the part that can become so difficult. Jeremiah said that the human heart when he talked about the heart how corrupt and how who who who can even know it. He said the human heart and the human heart can have things that are so embedded so deep in it that even your closest friends. Have you ever been shocked and surprised by people that you thought you knew and you thought you knew them so well? Oh my goodness. And you heard this or that or the other name. No, no way. No way they would ever be like that. Come to find out they were. Why? Because it was embedded so deep inside of them. And the heart is a very treacherous, dangerous thing. Only God can change that. You can change your appearance yourself on the outside, but only God could go into the heart. Now, this is some of the spiritual building blocks that God is building and making his people into. And when I look at this one of godliness, Carol, I was talking about the other day and I told her that I I don't mind telling you that I've been the most surprised by this one of all of them that we've looked at so far as far as the things that the Lord has opened in his word and allowed us to be able to look into and see to to help us to be like him. And today we'd like to look at another one of those if God will help us in an attribute of godliness. Now I realize it's probably going to shock you whenever I mention it to you, but what we want to look at today is going to church. &gt;&gt; Oh, amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. Who would have ever thought going to church would make you godly? Shall we read Luke 4 verse 16? And he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up. And as his custom was, you mean to tell me Jesus went to church? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't even an apostolic church. Mhm. &gt;&gt; It wasn't a Methodist church. It was a synagogue. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you all know how they worshiped in the synagogue services. Well, I read through them again yesterday to look at it historically. It sounded pretty boring to me. So, they read part of Leviticus. They read part of Deuteronomy. They go through a bunch of things and it was the same thing over and over and over again. The same words. They would read the same words, the same portion of scriptures. And then of course they would have songs. It was the same thing over and over and over again. And yet Jesus went to church. &gt;&gt; Now look at this. And he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up. And as his custom was, well, I'll tell you one thing. If Jesus custom was to go to church, it's mine, too. &gt;&gt; Now, I realize that there's people who would love to be able to go to church, but they can't do it because they're physically unable or there's not a church to where they can go. And those of you, and I hear from them every time that I that I deal with this, those that stream the service, "Oh, brother Donnie, what are we going to do? We ain't got a church to go. Now remember, this is people for for people who feel like they do not need to go to church or simply don't believe in it. But it's also for us who are regular churchgoers so that hopefully we will be able to see even greater why we go to church and what we should do when we get to church. So just going to church and showing up and being there is not all the Lord wants us to do. So now think of it going to a synagogue. Now remember there's only one temple but in lots of different outlying s places in Jerusale around side of Jerusalem in the land of Israel they would have a synagogue. Even today there is no temple but anywhere you find a Jewish community a very large one you're going to find a synagogue. So, a synagogue, they would have a certain portion of that. They would read the Torah, they would sing, they would do these different things. And then they'd also have like a fellowship hall, a fellowship building. Those of you that's been around, you've seen what they're made like. And this is sort of what it was. So, it was sort of a a common type of a place. Carol and I stood a few years ago and stood right on the very rocks of the synagogue that the Lord Jesus would have went into whenever this scripture would have been fulfilled. So it was like a community type of building but only for the Jews. So they would use it as a multi-purpose type place. They did not offer sacrifices. Remember, they read the law, they discussed the law, and whenever a boy came into his bar mitzvah, he was 12 years old. It was the first time that he was able to stand publicly. Remember, public worship has always been a great thing to God. So, their bar mitzvah was not in private. Their bar mitzvah was not away from everybody else, but it was in public. It was a public celebration. So the boy 12 years old, he comes before them and the priest hands him the scroll and he would turn there and read. Now according to them at 12 years old, he became a man. He was a man in the sense of that he could be able to read the Torah and be able to start commenting on what it was and what it meant. So here the Lord Jesus would have actually went to the synagogue at the age of 12 years old whenever he had have been allowed to read the Torah. But he didn't start going to church when he was 12. As a matter of fact, he went at the day of his dedication. You remember that? But his mother and stepfather would have taken him over and over and over again to church. So God went to church. &gt;&gt; Now to be like God, guess what? &gt;&gt; You and I need to go to church. &gt;&gt; Wow. My now you think this is an attribute of godliness that an element of message people will never attain to because they see no need whatsoever to go to church. They just don't do it. And they say, "Well, you know, you can't get very much truth there." Now, I want you to think 2,000 years ago and the setting, the scenario that would have been there. It was the same thing at every service over and over again, you knew exactly what scriptures they was going to read. You knew exactly some of the same things that the priest was going to say. So, there would have been hardly no spirituality in those services at all. There would have been no life, no spiritual life, no revelation. There would have been no preaching, no anointed men of God saying, "I feel led to go this way. The Lord changed my subject. I feel led." No, there was none of that at all. And Jesus went every time the doors was open. &gt;&gt; Now, think of how little truth that they had. You imagine they never seen a miracle their entire life. Jesus as a young boy going to church never saw a miracle. Jesus going to church never heard a Holy Ghostfilled anointed preacher stand up and preach the word. &gt;&gt; But it was men that were trained cold formal theological And Jesus went to church every time the doors is open. &gt;&gt; You got to be kidding me. To that kind of a church. &gt;&gt; And yet Jesus made it regular part of his life. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Now you know people use excuse. Well, I I don't always agree with everything that's preached. &gt;&gt; So you think he did? Now, if that would excuse you from going to church, then it should have excused the Lord Jesus. And after you got to be a young man, you can say, "You know what, mama? I don't want to go back no more. I mean, I know everything they're going to say before they say it. I I know what they're going to read. I know what they're going to do. We've been doing this for all of these years, and I really have no desire to go." Oh, but you see, God goes to church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There was no life, no new births, nobody received the Holy Ghost, nobody got healed, no deliverances, no miracles. And Jesus kept right on going to church. &gt;&gt; Why? God. So Jesus was actually known, and I love the way that Luke catches this. He's the only one of the four writers of the four gospels. And he actually places Jesus an element about Jesus human life. And I absolutely love it because he places Jesus in the scripture as being habitual when it come to going to church and being a worshshiper. So Jesus didn't just attend church, but Jesus was a worshipper in church. Now, he might have been one of the very few that actually did, you know, the rest of them, yes, praise Yahweh, hallelujah, Adonai, this, that, and the other. But can you imagine the Lord Jesus going to church? He worshiped. He praised. Hallelujah. Oh my. I mean, I kind of figured y'all would look at me strange, but I didn't think he'd look at me this strange this long. So, I'm hoping it'll pass, you know, here momentarily. So Jesus was an habitual church attender and he was also an habitual worshipper that every time he went to the house of God. Now what what a an absolute rebuke for those who in Christianity who say well I know what they're going to do. They're going to start at 10:00 or like us 11:00. Brother Lou is going to get up there and he's going to mess up saying this and you know the song leader is going to do this and whoever's going to sing that. Somebody's going to mess up on the sound system cuz they always do. Whoever turns up that air conditioner, they're absolutely freezing me to death. And somebody else on the other side of the church going through the change of life and they got 47 fans while they're sitting there flying. I know what brother Donny's good. He's going to read quotes. He's going to do this. You'd have had a hard time going to Jesus church. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So you see, it's not just the church and it's not just what everybody else is doing. The question is, what are you doing? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; When you come to church, &gt;&gt; you see, it's not about it being worked around the way you like church. It's not the way you like church. It's not really even the way I like church. It's the way God wants it. That's what we want to do is to be able to please him. Now imagine the corruption and the rottness of doctrine &gt;&gt; that was during this first century. Now it wouldn't that be an excuse to stay home. There would have been hardly any purity of truth and doctrine that he would have heard had they commented on it. It's easy to see they didn't have an understanding because there he was right among them and they never did know who he was and they still don't many of them. &gt;&gt; But wouldn't that be a reason to stay home? I said, "Well, they're blind. They don't know who I am. I ain't going up that bunch of blind bunch of people." Can't you see friends this attribute of God? &gt;&gt; This attribute of God is so valuable and so important. And yet so many message people ridicule it. dishonoring the resurrection every week &gt;&gt; and staying home and going shopping and listening to a tape and then go out and spend the rest of the day doing this and that and the other, whatever it is they do. &gt;&gt; Now, think of it. Either we have this or we don't go in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I don't understand people who don't go to church. &gt;&gt; They choose not to. I mean, and why they ever want to go to heaven? &gt;&gt; Cuz I mean, it's like church every day. &gt;&gt; So, if you can't go a couple of times a week, you'd never enjoy being to heaven. &gt;&gt; So, there would have been such corruption doctrinally. There would have been such blindness. You would have hardly heard any revelation at all unless Simeon would have come through every now and then. Now, if Simeon would have come there every now and then, he'd probably whenever they'd write read, you know, some of these scriptures of Isaiah 7:14 and, you know, Isaiah 35:3 and Zechariah 6:12 and Deuteronomy 18:15, uh, Genesis 3:15-18. And if they read some of them, hit say, "Glory." Of course, the deacons about, calm down, oh man, you're interrupting the preach. Oh, glory to God. I'll tell you one thing. Hallelujah. I'm going to see that baby born. They'd probably say, "Poor old guy. He's just got dementia or something. You know, he don't know where he's at." But most part, the rest of them just sat there and sleep. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; And they couldn't wait till church was over so they could talk about how many sheep they had, how many goats they had, how many horses, how many she assasses and camels, and how much money they made that week. &gt;&gt; Oh my. You know, it's amazing because all it's done is changed from sheep now to palladium or gold or silver or chrome &gt;&gt; or real estate. People haven't really changed that much, have they? &gt;&gt; So, there would have been such corruption and such rottness, but that had no effect whatsoever on the Lord Jesus going to church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You mean he went to church when there was nobody with revelation? Absolutely. He went to church when they was as blind as they could be. Absolutely. They done the same thing over and over again and he went back every time the doors is open. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was his custom. It was his custom. So, this is something that Where's Jesus at? Well, what time is it? It's on the Sabbath. I know exactly where he's at. He's in church. Well, wouldn't that be something to be said about us? My my. You see, there was nothing that would keep him away as far as what most people would use for excuses today from going to church. He went anyway to the house of God. Now I hope that you understand by bringing it this way that it is actually our duty as sons and daughters of God to attend church regularly. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Regularly and that much more. Paul says as we see the day approaching. Now notice that it is better. It would be actually better to go to a place where their doctrine is not 100% accurate and they might have a little bit of formality in their worship if they have any worship or they could be on the other side. They could be a little radic and they could be a little Pentecostal in their worship. But it would be better to do that and go and you give your all in that service than it would be to stay at home by yourself. You say, "How could you say that?" By the living word, the way he lived. How did he live? Did he find a perfect church? There were none. Come on, somebody. There were no perfect churches. There wasn't even none after the Holy Ghost come on the day of Pentecost. We can read the epistles of Paul and realize they all had their issues. And every message church in this day has its issues. Every message church has its problems. Every message individual has their problems. Whether Americans, whether they're Africans, whether they're Tennessans or Texans or wherever they're from, they have their issues. But to me, it is still my responsibility and my duty to go to the house of God and not just sit there like a bump on a pickle, but when I get there, I am going to worship. I'm going to sing. I'm going to clap my hands. I'm going to praise. That's who I am. &gt;&gt; Now notice even though now people look at well there's no churches around nowhere where the doctrine I 100% agree with them. I'll tell you one thing. I'd be better off to stay away from them. You're not following the pattern that Jesus followed. As a matter of fact, someone was telling me not long ago of a man that attended our church years ago and and he he went to one church and another church and another church and finally just ah then none of them churches ain't none of them you know on the word but yet he was witnessing to someone about the message and he was witnessing to a businessman and he said yeah have you ever heard God son a prophet no and the guy was a little bit curious about it you know so he started talking talking to him about this uh you know about this message. My goodness, he said some I've never even heard it before in my life. So the farther they went along and talking and so this man asked him and said, "So where do you go to church at?" He said, "Oh, I I don't go to any church." Well, aren't there some churches around your Yeah, but I don't go to any of them because I I don't agree with any of them. You know what the man done that he's trying to convert? Said, "You know what, sir? You need to be in church somewhere. So you're trying to tell me you've got more light than I do and you don't even go to church. Now you're talking about a slap in that man's face of his testimony. And the sad part about it is that denominational man he was talking to was better off than that message man was. You know why? Cuz he's so arrogant, so puffed up and he's not doing what Jesus done. Now Jesus could have stood outside the doors at every service he went. He could have critiqued this and throwed off on that. Said that was a lie. That wasn't true. And Jesus could have made every service turned it into total chaos. But instead of doing that, Jesus kept on going back to church. You imagine as a little boy, the little boy Jesus would stand back go adonai, adoni, Elohim, Adonai. He would worship and he become a teenager and Jesus would pray and Jesus would worship and he'd stand there as he'd hold the Torah when he was 13 years old and his little locks around his head and he would stand there like that. Oh, Adonai. Adonai, Adoni. And they always knew Jesus was in church because you saw him and you could hear him. Hallelujah. I ain't much of a silent worshipper. I ain't much. Come on, somebody. I realize there's a time, but I'll tell you one thing. I I believe when we come to the house of God, if we ever express our feelings, our emotions, everything that we are, it should be toward the living God. People want silent prayer and silent specials and silent preachers. Where in the world do you get that at in God's word? Lift up your voices. The Bible says, "Lift up your hands. Clap your hands. All you people shout with the voice of triumph to the Lord. If you'd shout at a volleyball game or a baseball game or a basketball game and won't lift your voice to the Lord Jesus, I say shame on you. I said shame on you. Let it be our custom, hallelujah, that we not only go to the house of God, but we worship when we're there. We say amen to the word and when it cuts us we say Lord help us. &gt;&gt; Oh my. You imagine the doctrines were not pure and the service Jesus never attended a service that was perfect. &gt;&gt; But he went to church every time the doors is open. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now wonder why he would do that. So then where are people who just refuse to go to church? I'm talking about message people who claim they're in a more revelated state of the light. Where do they get their example to stay home? &gt;&gt; Well, it's not from Jesus &gt;&gt; and it's not from the apostles. And it's not from our prophet. &gt;&gt; Say it. &gt;&gt; So could it be it's from this guy? [Music] &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Now he goes to church, &gt;&gt; but he don't go to worship God. &gt;&gt; The devil goes to church and demons go to church. &gt;&gt; But they don't go to worship God. &gt;&gt; They don't go to get anything out of the service. They go to pick. I don't like this. I don't like that. That wasn't the way I wanted it. That wasn't the way I wanted it. And then they come with that attitude and then they'll get on people that will let them get on them. &gt;&gt; I don't want them devils on me. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Have I ever been in a perfect service? Never in all my life. I've probably been in more than most of you all have. And I've sometimes, you know, you're going through, boy, I wish that was better. I wish that was better. I wish they hadn't said that. I wish I hadn't said that. But you know what you do? You keep on going back and saying, "Praise God, Lord. Maybe I'm the one that's out of tune. Maybe I'm the one that needs help." Come on, saints. &gt;&gt; Now, do we want to be like God or not? &gt;&gt; Well, God, &gt;&gt; you see, it's always been of vast importance to God that worship was displayed in a public manner. Public manner. So, and it's also our responsibility to not only come to the house of God, but also assist and make sure that our children understand the value so that if all of us older people die and the next generation, they'll sell this building here and they say, "We don't go to church." That's up to you parents to instill the value and the importance in your children's life of going to church. &gt;&gt; Question answer is 1964 a sister asked brother Brandham. She said that she believed the message and her son with her believed the message and received it. But her husband went to a denominational church and he started talking to their son. I'll just brief this part. You can read it if you like. And they started he started talking to her son and he pulled him away from following the message as well. And then the sister tells that her husband wants her to go to church with her with him rather. And she asked the question should she go to church with her husband. This isn't the answer. Go with your husband, but don't be partakers of what they're doing. See, you're supposed to love your husband, and love is what does it. You just be real salty and he'll get thirsty if there's anything in him. Don't join their denomination. You said stay away from that denomination, which is part of the sister's question. Don't join it. Go to it. If you can't get a whole loaf, get a half. &gt;&gt; If you can't get a half, get a slice. &gt;&gt; Let me break it on down. If you can't get a slice, get a crumb. If you can't get a crumb, get a smell. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; If you want to go to church, you'll find something good to go for. Now, &gt;&gt; I know y'all think I'm nuts anyway. But I'm going to tell you one thing. If I lived in a community where there was nothing there but a Baptist church or a Methodist church or whatever it was, I would do my best to go at least every now and then just to let the devil know I still profess to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because there's something about public identification that you're not ashamed of your God. You're not ashamed of being recognized that you are a Christian. They might throw me out because I if I'm going I am going to worship. I'm going to worship. I'm going to praise. I ain't going to sit there. I'm going to bless the name of my God. He's done so much for me. I've got so much to thank him for. Now, I want you to notice how that brother Brennham takes this and he said, "But that's the way you win your husband." That by doing that, don't be arrogant. &gt;&gt; Why? Why would he throw that in now to a message believer? &gt;&gt; Does that tend to go with message believers? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; In the way they look at others. That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't be arrogant and he'll know he's got just as much as you have. &gt;&gt; So you mean a denominational believer would have just as much as a message believer if the message believer has an understanding of the message, but with it they got an arrogant spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Talk to us Jesus. &gt;&gt; Talk to us Jesus. But when you can show something that you have that he don't have, that'll make him thirst to be like you. Wow. Godliness. Don't you want so much of God in your life that other people will long to be like you? I'll never forget it. I don't think as long as I live. Let me scan the audience. Yeah. Okay. I'll see them. There was there was a several years ago at the other place. There was a man and his wife come up and they're here this morning. They come up and and and the the the sister says she hadn't made the full commitment yet to the Lord. Uh but I'd been watching the spirit of God deal with her for a while. And as she come up there, standing right by her husband, and she told me, "I want what he's got." Now, her mother and daddy's here today. They're godly people. Family members here today, godly people. I hope I was a godly pastor. &gt;&gt; But she didn't say she wanted what I had. &gt;&gt; She didn't say she wanted what her mama had, what her daddy had. Not discrediting that. But who was it that had made such an impact upon her life? Her husband. Brothers, that's the kind of husbands we want to be. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Can you amen say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of wives that you wives want to be. Now, here the prophet reversed around. It was a sister. So, the prophet is teaching this message woman how to be able to live the message every day in such a way that her Methodist I wasn't going to call it, but that's what he was. So that her Methodist husband would be able to hunger and thirst after what she had. Brother, sister, when the message of the hour does that in our lives, then let's share that. We want to share a bunch of theology and share this and that and the other. Let's wait till we get a good dose of the Holy Ghost before we go to try to telling people about Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, watch this. And trying to do go to service again. The prophet said, "People think that I don't even believe in people going to church. That's a million miles from the truth. &gt;&gt; Not a half a mile, not a quarter of a mile, not two miles, a million miles. So those in the message who oh my who propagate this, who proclaim it, who like to set it forth, you are a million miles according to the very tapes that you listen to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From the truth. We &gt;&gt; must &gt;&gt; what? &gt;&gt; I can show you where he said we must assemble ourselves together, but I cannot show you where he said &gt;&gt; he said &gt;&gt; we must play his tapes when we come to church. Come on. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, are we going to say what he said? No, we're not. A lot of us are not going to say it. We're going to say what we like that he said and what we don't like, we ain't going to say it. &gt;&gt; Well, come on, somebody. I don't know about you this morning. I want to say it whether I like it or whether I don't. There's things he said that burns me up. There's things he said that sets me on fire. But I say, "Amen." Lord, help me to move up. Help me to move up. Come on, somebody. Let's have church this morning. There's things that he said. Boy, I can. Amen. Hallelujah. But you can tell a lot of people ain't guilty of that cuz that amen comes out when it's really coming across to them. They sat there and that bottom lip pooches out like I don't know what. And you know they're guilty as a hound dog in the hen house. But a real saint of God can say, "Lord, help me. Help me. Lord, I want to move up." Come on, children. Why do we come to the house of God? The prophet said, "We come to church to find our faults. We come to church to hear our shortcomings." Why? So the gospel can come forth and straighten us out and get us ready to leave this world. &gt;&gt; Oh my. We must assemble ourselves together and that much more as we see the day approaching. See, we must &gt;&gt; It is &gt;&gt; come together in unity. If I lived in a city and they had nothing there, well, some church, I don't want to call any name, but any church, if they only believe one thing, &gt;&gt; that Jesus was divine and all the rest of it was wrong. &gt;&gt; I'd go to that church. &gt;&gt; Why? He understood the importance of assembling yourselves together. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If I can't get a whole loaf of bread, I'll take a slice. I'll go listen and worship the Lord and show him. Oh. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Oh, you mean so those who don't go to church aren't showing him? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They're doing their part. &gt;&gt; Preach it. &gt;&gt; Godliness. &gt;&gt; Godliness. &gt;&gt; To be like God. and he wants to be like God. &gt;&gt; All right. Remember, your hand will answer to you at the dead of judgment. Now, notice I want to show him that I'm doing my part. I want him to know that I'm alive. Well, can't he know that you're alive when you're staying home listening to a tape 12:00 Eastern time all around the world? Can't he know that you refuse? I know, friends, you look at me like I've got a ward on the side of my head, but you don't understand what's going on around this message around the world. This this movie is gaining momentum everywhere. People staying at home, people leaving churches, people falling out with one another. Best of friends that have been friends for years and years. And yet they're saying, "If you go hear a preacher preach, you ain't hearing the perfect voice of God. I will not go. I'm staying home." You're breaking what the very prophet of God taught. Excuse me. Now listen what he said about going to church publicly. actually what it does. I want him to know that I'm alive, but I want everybody to know what side I'm on. And how you going to do that, brother Brennham? By going to church. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I want everybody to know what side I'm on. I assemble with the Christians and their worship and serve the Lord. Oh, why? Why? What was the necessity of going to church? God loves to go to church. &gt;&gt; God loves to come together with his children and let them worship him. &gt;&gt; Well, can't you worship him at home? Yes, I do. Every day of my life, I worship God every day of my life. Every night, every morning, noon time, I worship him. Every day of my life, I don't wait to come to church to worship him. My life is worship. &gt;&gt; My life is a worship and an offering unto my God. You understand? I hope you all do the same thing. You should look every moment that you have time. Well, what am I going to thank him for? What about life? What about breast? What about sanity? What about the clothes you got on your back? What about the breakfast that you ate, the water that you drink, the sunshine that he allows to come upon the oxygen that he gives you, a home church, a pastor that loves you, brothers and sisters, a resurrection and rapture, faith, hope, mercy, goodness, kindness, generally. You want me to go on? Have you got enough wrote down? You've got enough to praise him for. You should never stop praising him. But I'm going through so much stuff. And it'll be him that'll bring you through the stuff you're going through. He's the one who will give you victory. He's the one who's brought you safe thus far. &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 16:18, the very first time this word is used in the New Testament, and the founder of the church is the one who uses it. And I say unto thee that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church. Ecclesia, ecclesia, assembly, a gathering of citizens called out from their &gt;&gt; glory. &gt;&gt; Called out from their homes into some That's what he said. &gt;&gt; Now, this is what the founder said. &gt;&gt; It's not up for debate. &gt;&gt; Called out from their homes into some public place, an assembly of the people convened again at the public place of the council for the purpose of deliberating. That's what I'm doing this morning, deliberating. Why? Why can't we do that at home? I guess so. I suppose if that's what Jesus wanted, he could have used another word. But this one is the one he used to describe his bride. &gt;&gt; And it just so happens I believe I'm part of it. So, as long as I'm physically able and if I get too old to come anymore, y'all can't roll me in a wheelchair. And if I've got a stream, me and Carol will sit side by side and hold hands in the wheelchair and we'll shout in our wheelchair. May not be able to move from the half of the body up. But I'm going to do whatever I can. If I come to church and I'm 85 or 90 and I fall asleep, have a little pity on me and somebody gouge me on the side if I go to sleep. But please bring me to the house of God. If I get to where I was like John was, and they had to pack him to the house of God, but John said, "I've got to go to church. I've got to go to church now. have got to be in the presence of God. But it's not just the presence of God. It's the presence of God's children. People that you're going to spend eternity with. In this presence today is healing. In this house is deliverance. In this house, no matter what you need of, it is here today with the people of God. Hebrews chap 10 24. Now Paul was addressing this issue of going to church in his day. Now I want you to get the setting of it. He tells them in the next verse down here not to forsake the assembling of themselves together. So there was a temptation not to go to church in this time frame in the first first century. But you realize it wasn't Dollywood and it was why we got a picnic up on Rome Mountain and we'll skip church today. Come to church and then do your picnic at Rome Mountain. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. But the Romans was following to their churches and they would go in and raid the services &gt;&gt; and take people out and cut their heads off. Pregnant women had their bellies ripped open and their babies jerked out of their belly and dashed their brains against rocks. They were being burned at the stake. So they would follow them to church to know whether they met. Was they going to the grocery store? Actually, if you laid out of church and went to the grocery store, they let you live. &gt;&gt; But you know who they got? Those that went to church. &gt;&gt; And they knew them first century Christians that was filled with the Holy Ghost went to church. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But this fear, this fear had got among them and part of them had got so afraid. Now brothers, think of it. You're the protectors of your home. How hard it would be, brother Joel. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; For us to know if we pulled up to Word of Life Church and the police, state troopers, the militia, the military would be standing out there. All right. Get their name, get their ID, get their license plate. We'll be contacting you this week. &gt;&gt; Why? What have I done wrong? You come to church. &gt;&gt; Wonder if it have enough left to pay the electric bill. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Think of what these Christians were facing. &gt;&gt; And yet in the face of that, Paul said, "Forsake not the assembling &gt;&gt; of yourselves together." Yeah. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine, my friends, the judgment of God that will await some of these message people? They're facing none of that. &gt;&gt; But they're under a lie of hell. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine when them first century Christians walk up there as a testimony against the modernday Leodysian message people &gt;&gt; that could drive to a house of God right down the road, right up the road, whatever. I don't want to go. I don't like that. I don't like that. They're not playing tapes. They're not doing this. God have mercy on your soul. &gt;&gt; Now, notice how he addresses this in verse 24 before he says, "Forsake not as simming of yourselves together in 25." Let us consider one another. So, you see, fellowship with God should never wind up being selfishness on our part. Well, I'm going to church because I want this and I need that and I this and I that. Paul is wanting them to get it straight the reason they go to church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works. So you mean the leoty, the Christian believers can actually provoke one another to love and to good works? &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; So you come to church and you you see brother so and so ain't been there and his wife and their children have been there. You you well I'll pray for him. That's the deacon's responsibility. It might be your responsibility just as well to check on them and say, "Hey, y'all doing okay? We've been missing you. We want you to know we love you and we're here to do anything that we can to help you. Are y'all y'all okay? We love you. This is what your Bible says. &gt;&gt; Provoke them to good works. Now, why you imagine the saints of God when they got this letter and they said, "Oh, I don't should we tell brother so and so and sister so and so, I know she's got a newborn and and that they're scared to come to church." They're afraid. Children, look how spoiled we are. If we wanted to, we could have church every night of the week. &gt;&gt; You could come here daily and pray, you could do whatever you want. Oh my, how would we have acted in that age to where our very life and the preachers makes you wonder how many preachers we'd have today? &gt;&gt; I'm talking about real God ones. &gt;&gt; And they knew while they were standing up there that they could be taken straight to jail. Let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works. You see, we fellowship and we meet together not just for God and for us, but for one another. I find it amazing that the emphasis is not just put on what you get out of church. That's right. But it's on you helping others &gt;&gt; and you ministering to others. You see faithfulness in church attendance, especially when you're down &gt;&gt; and when you're low, &gt;&gt; you lose a loved one and you don't want to come back to church for a while because you don't want people asking you how you doing and what's going on. &gt;&gt; And yet I've seen some of you come in here and sat down and I knew your heart was broken. And humanly you'd rather stayed away for a bit cuz you knew everybody's going to come. How you doing? How you doing? And you come home anyway. You know what that did to us? That so encouraged us. &gt;&gt; That so helped us that in your pain. Well, you could have stayed. Sure. You could have stayed and streamed the service and sat outside in your car until it come time for me to get up and preach and then you dart in the door and as soon as I pray, you're gone. cuz you don't want to you don't want to shake nobody's hand. What kind of yellowbellied coward is that? Come to the house of God. Get in there before the singing starts. Sit down, concentrate, meditate. Amen, brother Donnie. Preach. Read your Bible. Sit there. Sing with the saints. I don't want just the devil to know I'm identified with preaching. I want the devil to know I'm identified with the singing part of the service. I'm identified with the prayer request part of the service. Come on, somebody. There ain't going to be no preaching in heaven, but there's going to be a whole lot of singing going on if I'm going to be identified with the singing there. I'm going to sing here. I know I can't carry a tune in a large bucket, but I'm going to carry it as well as I can. I may battle out off keys sometime, but I want God to know what side I'm on. If the devil, oh my, can his people can do what they do? What about us as the children of God? Off key, on key, no key, middle key, we ought to sing. We ought to clap our hand. We ought to amen the preacher. We ought to come and bring our presence even when we don't feel like it. Why? It encourages others. &gt;&gt; You want to know one of the most discouraging things a pastor can deal with? &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; people not attending church. So for some of these sermons that I study for, ask my wife, she knows how much I study. Ask my family. They come up to eat with us and I'll say, "I got to go. I got to go study." I may look at a thousand quotes and scriptures for one Sunday morning service. Hours and hours and hours and hours and hours. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; And people come in, run in and out, sleep. Some don't even show up. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But let me just tell you and let hell know it. If there ain't nobody here Wednesday night but me and Carol, I'm still preaching what God's put on my heart. I'm not letting my joy be affected by the devil, but it sure ain't going to work very good for you. You encourage me. You encourage every man of God that gets up there. It makes it worth the effort. Oh, come on, somebody. We are here not to live for ourself &gt;&gt; but live for others. &gt;&gt; Oh my. You imagine brother Joel this must have been a hard verse to write. Now you there's no way you and I can understand the responsibility brother Harvey that Paul must have felt when he wrote this knowing that what if he writes this and somebody comes to church and they lose their life &gt;&gt; that very night and he's the one who told them to come to the house of God. &gt;&gt; But Paul deemed it worth it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What a better way to go. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not forsaking the assembling of yourselves together, as the manner of some is. Now notice the word forsaking. Read it there. Leave, abandon, desert. Do you understand all these folks around the message that have quit going to church, they are deserters in the army of God? &gt;&gt; That's good, brother. &gt;&gt; They have deserted their post of duty. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Imagine the brand tabernacle setting empty this morning &gt;&gt; and has for years. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God have mercy. The prophet told us, remember, one day this tabernacle &gt;&gt; will lose its strength. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And it has. &gt;&gt; Is that going to be our pattern? &gt;&gt; Are we going to follow that? Is that what we want? That's not what I believe the message was sent for. The message was sent to restore the hearts of the children back to the faith of the original apostolic fathers. But why do they do this or under deception of the devil? Come on, somebody. That's exactly right. And they don't believe that brother Brandham came to restore that word. No way. They believe this message is something totally new. Well, if you make Brother Brener bringing something totally new, then you are making him a false prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Only a false prophet brings new things that are contrary to the written word of God. And if brother Brandham would have preached things contrary to that Bible, I could not follow this message. I would not have gi my all. But I hear his message and I look in the Bible and I see it saying the same thing. So what am I going to do? I'm going to give all that I have to this word. I'm going to give all of my life to this word. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Forsake, leave, abandon, desert, leave in straits, leave helpless. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the people in that community in the Brandham Tabernacle when they passed by going to their church here or there and there and there it sits empty. Someone told me not long ago they up there and they actually went in to see it and it smelled moldy. You can go in all right and have silent prayer. Where's that at in the Bible? Do we want mold on our walls? &gt;&gt; Why is there mold on the walls? Cuz there's mold in their souls. &gt;&gt; They're not saying what God's prophet said. They're not saying what the Bible said. &gt;&gt; Well, you don't say. Don't just sit here and scream amen to it. And if you don't come to church the way you ought to come to church, you ain't doing it neither. Well, preach, Brother Donnie. I don't want to just say amen to it. I want to Amen. I'm going to let my feet do the amen and two. I'm going to get up and put my clothes on and come to the house of God and sing and pray and worship and magnify the name of our God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Desert, leave, &gt;&gt; leave helpless. totally abandoned. So this is the word that Paul chose to use because some of the saints of God was fearing for their lives, &gt;&gt; not laziness and slothfulness. Their lives was at stake going to church. But Paul was saying, "Children, I know it's hard. I know it's scary for you, but you got to keep going to church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Totally abandoned, utterly forsaken. God have mercy on those that are responsible for turning that tabernacle into a molded rundown building. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Where Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; sent his anointing and his angels there to bring messages like the world had never heard before. healings, miracles, signs, wonders, the word of God, Christ Jesus himself, come there in that last week of March and tore those seals open and reveal those seals, things that have been hid since the foundation of the world. And now it sits there shut up. It is the duty of the saints of God to assemble &gt;&gt; together for public worship. Who says Godmen? &gt;&gt; He wants it done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; As the manner of some is. So, here's some of those dear saints, brother Rob. So, here is Paul is identifying said some of them it's become habitual. They're just afraid to go to church anymore. &gt;&gt; And Paul said, "Now look, children, you can't do that." Well, why don't they tell them, "Why don't we take a sabbatical? I'll tell you what, we'll shut the churches down for about 6 months or a year or something like that. And once this persecution thing is over, once people are Christians or, you know, that they're going to give them a break, no doubt in time. And once this is all over, we'll all come back together. And how many will you have left?" &gt;&gt; Amen. We've seen what the devil done to us in the COVID shutdown. &gt;&gt; Ain't talking about us just the message as a church. I'm talking about the message around the world. And yet one of the main leaders of it said CO was one of the greatest things that ever happened to the message. How in the world could anybody full of the Holy Ghost say such trash? Brother Donnie. Yes. Rubbish of the devil. When God's word tells us to come together and somebody said it's the greatest thing ever was cuz it'll force people to listen to more tapes. You need the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say it, Lord. &gt;&gt; You see, so in the times of persecution, the great temptation was, "Don't stop being a Christian. Don't stop living for God, but just don't go to church." And they entered into this dangerous neglect. So Paul tells them to exhort one another. Let's press play this morning, shall we? Except I'll read it to you. Here we go. The breach between the seven church ages and the seven seals. Page 116, paragraph 327. You love him. Isn't he wonderful? Oh, what would we do without this? Man shall not live by bread alone, but every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. Now remember where this is preached, breadtham tabernacle, &gt;&gt; the place that today is shut down. &gt;&gt; Oh, feed me Lord upon your word. Forsake not to assemble yourselves together as the manner of unbelievers. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Not people with a greater revelation. and believers. And it was said in the same building that's sitting empty this morning. God have mercy, children. What will the future hold if the Lord carries and goes on for a few years and I die and go by the way of all men and then it comes up? How many will we have that'll still attend Word of Life Church? Will you so instill it in your children? Children, we've got to go to church. It's imperative that we go. But daddy, the young people ain't kind to me. Then you think they was kind to Jesus. They treated Jesus bad. They run him down. But he said, "We're going to church today, mama. Get your clothes on. We're going to the house of God." Why? God goes to church. That's godliness. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh my The prophet said, "Many of these poor wandering, straying children stirring around through the world tonight without a church home." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Grant, Lord, that they'll see their error. &gt;&gt; And come to the house of the living God. &gt;&gt; And word of Life Church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen. &gt;&gt; Help us now for we ask it in Jesus name. s of the Christ. And I said, "You get that bunch of lukewarm church members down there to the altar and let them pray through till the Holy Ghost sets their soul of fire. There's no signing cards." He was talking to a pastor now. So he had to get so many people to sign a card to at least show up twice a year, Christmas and Easter. This is Brother Brandham's response to him. You get that bunch of lukewarm church members down there to the altar and let them pray through. I think that's somewhat our message folks need. Till the Holy Ghost sets their soul on fire, there'll be no signing cards. God's in their heart. God goes to church. &gt;&gt; He loves to worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God loves to worship. He don't want us to come to church and suffer like we're half dead. He wants us to worship because God loves to go to church. [Applause] &gt;&gt; God to church. He loves to worship. &gt;&gt; So to be godly, we got to worship when we get there. preaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, you say, "How in the world can that be true? That God loves to worship. Who's he worshiping?" [Music] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Who do you figure? Right. &gt;&gt; Remember the old English vows which used to say and I' I've married a few people &gt;&gt; still with them to this day. With thee my body I thee worship. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With thee my body I the worship. And the Lord God loves to go to church because there he loves to pull his bride in his arms and he loves to anoint her with his presence. He loves to bring healing to her body. He loves Don't you understand? He with his body, oh glory God, he with his body went to the cross and gave his body and he could say it back to us with thee. Oh hallelujah, with my body, I give it to you. You know why you're sitting there dried up like that? You don't understand the meaning of worship. It means to adore. It means to bring one to an elevated level. The Lord Jesus don't want to just come to church with a bunch of cold dead church members, but he wants to have a relationship. He wants to have a love affair, a love affair with every one of his children. And he pulls you in his arms and makes love to you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you. We feel that every person is duty bound &gt;&gt; to attend some church and belong to some church as a Christian. &gt;&gt; Wow. Press play, obey. &gt;&gt; Don't just press play and say nay. &gt;&gt; Press play and obey. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. You want to rhyme it out? I can make as many memes as you can. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We feel that every person is duty bound. Does every person mean every person or not? [Applause] Many people say, "Oh, I stay home and read my Bible. I'm just as well off." &gt;&gt; No. prophets. &gt;&gt; The Bible said we shouldn't forsake to assemble ourselves together. &gt;&gt; We got to do that. &gt;&gt; We've got to stand together. And the church said, [Applause] happened in a certain nation that I was in. Someone set up the meetings and we didn't have any cooperation and they just set up the meeting and thousands poured into that country and there was no church home. What difference does that make? &gt;&gt; Now this is 1957. It was the India trip &gt;&gt; which was 1954. So they done had from 1948 up to the early part of 1954 on tape. &gt;&gt; Why didn't they set up tape churches? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God to church. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I've been there at that little church in India and saw that marketplace of what they said tens of thousands of people gathered there and so many of them they couldn't even get them in. It shut down the police. It shut down the city. It shut down everything. You know what gets me is? If Brother Brandham were to be here today, them some same people that that keep on going with all their nonsense about not going to church, Brother Brandham would go to church. And you know what them sorry outfits would do? They'd get ready and get up and go to church. &gt;&gt; They wouldn't be home pressed and play if the prophet of God was standing in the platform. It shows me the height of their hypocrisy. &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. Word of life. You should come to church whether your pastor is preaching or not. You should come to church whether your favorite evangelist is there. It is your duty to come to the house of God in order to encourage one another and in order to let the devil know, hey, they still go to church. And in order to let God know, hey, they still go to church. I'm going to go down and make love to them while they're there. &gt;&gt; Now, can you imagine 50,000 converts And it tells us the same story in 1962 and said every one of them went back to the Sikhs James and Buddhist right &gt;&gt; and he tells us why there was no church home to take them to. I don't know what happened. We had five nights and 5,000 each night or more come to Christ. I don't know what happened. I'm going to go ahead and read the rest of this. &gt;&gt; I've learned a little better than that. Now, &gt;&gt; anybody that's got a brain can you learn better. Come on. Let's make God's prophet what he was. A human being learning as he went. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; This is his words. Press play and say it. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Every every Well, apparently one every wasn't enough. Remember Jesus saying, "Surely, surely, truly, truly." That was double verification. So the prophet double verified it again. Every every person that's saved, oh, I found the issue. Showers the world. Every every person that's saved ought to have a church home. &gt;&gt; And every person that's saved in here this morning said, "What? &gt;&gt; Every every person that's saved ought to have a church home." But brother Donnie, a lot of the people at their church don't like me. I know how you feel. I feel the same way sometimes. But you know what? I ain't going to stop coming. Y'all may vote me out as pastor, but you can't vote me out from being able to come here. And if you to block me at the door, I'll sat outside and stream and I run up and down the parking lot. Glory to God. Jesus saved me. Hallelujah. I'm going to heaven. I will not stay home. I'm not going to stay at the house and pout. I'm going to come to church and shout hallelujah. I'm called to worship God. I'm called to go to church. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Every every person that's saved ought to have a church home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They ought to be in church every &gt;&gt; every &gt;&gt; time that church has a service or every time you pass it, &gt;&gt; go in, &gt;&gt; open the doors and go in and pray or do something. &gt;&gt; You see, friends, he had a respect of the house of God. I'm afraid many message people do not. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine then that he'd tell people that just passed by the church building just go in and pray. Can I read one more? &gt;&gt; Oh, I know there's many rise up and go out and say, "Oh, I don't need to go to church anymore. Praise God. Notice how religious they are now. So they tell their lie and then praise God. &gt;&gt; I don't need to go to church anymore. Praise God. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost has come. He's the teacher. When you get that idea, you're just wrong. &gt;&gt; Why did the Holy Ghost set teachers in the church? &gt;&gt; Amen. If he was going to be the teacher, there are first apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists, and pastors. The Holy Spirit set teachers in the church so he could teach through the teacher. &gt;&gt; God sent pastors in the church so hopefully he could pastor through the pastors. He sent evangelist to the church so he could evangelize through the evangelist. He said people in the church instead of chairs, instead of pews so he could live in your life. God don't live in your padded chair. God don't live in no padded pew. God wants your heart, my heart, our soul, that he can live inside of us and be able to let people know, do you go to church? Oh, no. I'm in the message. I don't go to church. Well, you're not in the message there. Because if you really believe God's message of the hour, you find you a place. Well, brother Don, ain't none of them perfect. Why in the world would you want to go to a perfect church? You'd ruin it in five minutes being there. Ain't no one of you perfect, including the preacher that's preaching to you today. I ain't looking for a perfect building. I ain't looking for a perfect people. I found a perfect God. And that perfect God will produce a perfect bride. to read two. Can I read one more? Plus that last one that I read, that would be two, right? One plus one. Brethren, when you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost, it separates you. It delivers you from the things of the world. &gt;&gt; It makes you love God. &gt;&gt; Here we go. &gt;&gt; It makes you go to church. [Music] That's the problem. &gt;&gt; A lot of these folks don't have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; If they had the Holy Ghost, it'd grab them up. Get your tie on. Get your shirt. I don't want to go to church. I don't like going to church. They're going to have preachers. I don't like this that. The Holy Ghost said, "I never asked you if you wanted to go." This is an order. And you're in the army of God. You get up and put your britches on. You put your shirt on your tie if you're wearing a tie. You don't want to have fine with me that you get to the house of God and don't you stop and roll that bottom lift out but you go to clap in your hand and you smile at that man of God and you pray for that man of God cuz he's been up half a night to in order to serve you a good warm Sunday meal. You ought to realize it. You ought to say, "Preach it, brother." Go ahead, brother. I'm with you. Amen. Hallelujah. Encourage that man of God. Encourage the people sitting around by you to say, "Amen, too. [Applause] Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It makes you love God. It makes you go to church. It makes you worship him. It makes you tell your neighbor about it. &gt;&gt; It makes you live above sin. Don't open it, Donnie. Who's running this thing back there in the back? You know what I done? I laid this over and I got all these quotes right here in front of me on this screen. &gt;&gt; Oh, children, &gt;&gt; it ain't no wonder Satan hates church. It ain't no wonder you have such a time when it comes to going to the house of God. You ever have that hard of a time when you're going to Walmart, &gt;&gt; Kroger, Engles, your favorite football team, baseball team, basketball team? Isn't it amazing that everything in the world will try to hinder you from church? How it must please Papa when you come in and you say, "We made it." And you look around said, "Where's Susie?" Oh, dear God, we left her at home. Oh, Lord have mercy. Everything in the world would be on your mind. Cuz Satan has been looking over my shoulder and he sees what God's put on my heart and he says, "Oh Lord, &gt;&gt; if Daniel gets that, oh my goodness, if that sister gets it, oh, the demons go up there and mess up with it, mess up their minds, cause this and cause that, cause it." If if they say if he he says that and they get it, it'll set them free from that thing that's been bothering them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're too late. &gt;&gt; I can done tell by the looks on their faces, they got it. Hallelujah. Let's bow our heads together. We'll pick it up again. Lord, oh Jesus. Thank you. Thank you, Lord. I pray today that you'd help each of us. What makes my heart sad about this Lord preaching it is if we could see brother Frank and sister Jackie and ask them would y'all rather be sitting at home streaming because you're not physically able to come to church &gt;&gt; if I could go down into South Africa talk to them folks there who stream our services way out in the middle of nowhere have no church, no preacher around. And I could ask them, "Would y'all rather stay home and stream?" Some of them just recently thought they might be able to get a visa to move to the States and they thought they might be able to be allowed to come here. Oh, how excited they were just to be able to go to church. Here we are, Jesus. We can go and the least little thing discourages us. Forgive us, Father. Help us. I pray, dear God. Oh, I know our families are going to go on vacations and trips and things like that. Sure, but the negligence is not so much a vacation. The negligence is not a family outing or something like that, but the negligence is when it's just easier to stream and stay home. You never allowed us or any other churches to start using streaming so that people would just stay at the house. Lord, there's something about us coming together. May we always do it, Lord, I pray. And maybe not just get here, but getting here is part of the battle for sure. But now it's hearing time, listening time, worshiping time. We love you, Father. How many of you today would raise your hand to the Lord? Lord, forgive me. I I've not had the always had the right attitude about church. I admit it, Lord. I've been sawful and lazy. Would you forgive me, Jesus? Would you lay your hand over on that person standing by you and let's just off for a word of prayer. I think of a children if you'd lived in the synagogue day and they would have read the exact same scriptures over and over again made some of the exact same comments service after service after service. Would you like Jesus have been faithful? Oh, you'd have stayed home said he don't need to go. They don't need to go. Thomas missed one meeting and wouldn't you know it that was the very meeting Jesus showed up in a glorified body. Oh my. May God so strike our hearts with the deeper sense of love and devotion to realize you going to church. It's not just about you, but it's when you're there, you're encouraging your pastor. You're encouraging others that see you've come through a hard trial and a hard time and yet they see you pressing and they can tell you're heavy and distraught and you don't know what to do but you come anyhow. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, as we have our hands laid one upon the other. Now it's not just me praying but it's your children praying for one another. Father, I pray dear God, may each of us fall in love with you more than we ever have in our life. And if we fall in love with you, it'll reflect itself by meeting together with you and your children where there you can worship. I believe you want to come in this place this morning with your presence. Put your healing arms, your loving arms around those that are weary and troubled and sad and pull them up close to you, Jesus. Just whisper secret things to them. Oh, hallelujah. Who are we? I know, Lord. Who are we that the almighty God would desire to pull us into his loving arms? I can't say that I fully understand it, but all I know is I believe it's the truth. Help us, Jesus. Forgive us for ever having the idea church as usual. Lord, may we come under such expectation when we walk through them doors that we never know from one service to the next what you're going to do, what you're going to say, how you're going to move. Oh, we worship you, Lord. We worship you. We always want to be open to you that you can do as you wish to do. But we also realize some services we may not see near as much display of your power. And one of the reasons could be because you're wanting to see what we're going to do in that service. So you want to see how are we going to love you with no anointing? How are we going to praise you with no shouting sermon? What are we going to do in that service? And I don't want to fail, Lord. Oh, hallelujah. I bless your name today, Lord God. Can we just lift our hands together now, friends, and just close your eyes? I know you got lunch plans. Beautiful day outside. You got things you're going to do. Nothing wrong with that. But let's not let's not let that crowded to his time. Hallelujah. We worship you, Lord God. I bless your name, Jesus. I thank you, Father. We praise you, Lord. We're here to encourage. We're here, Father. It's our duty. Yes. We have fulfilled our duty today. But we want it to be more than dutious works. We want it to be from our souls, from our hearts. Oh Jesus, with my body I thee worship. With my hands, with my mouth, I thee worship my God. With my soul, I thee worship. I give to you what I give to none other. There's not a person in the world that I love any more any more precious and dear to me than Carol than down to my children, my grandchildren, my church, my friends around the world. But you have that sacred special place that you're the only one that gives a certain type of love and only one that I give a certain type back. It's reserved for you only, Lord. We worship Jesus. We worship you Jesus. With my body, the worship, [Music] with my blood, I gave for you. My sorrow and my crying that day. It was opened all for you. For you are the reason [Music] that I went to Calvary. [Music] Now broad I peel. I ask you my love. Would you give your body to me? Give me all you. Give me all you. I want your hands. I want your eyes. Would you give it all to me? Will you give me all you are? Will you give me all you are? And one day I'll give a new body to you. Service after service I come to meet you. [Music] time after time. I'm there to greet you, but you're so busy with your wife and your children and your business and all your other things, too. that you scarcely raise your hand and your voice and give me time I want from you. Will you give me your all my bride? Lord God forgive us. Oh, will you give me your all, my loving bride. I love you and I want you and I need you to be my wife. Will you give me your all? Will you give me your all? For I gave my all for you. [Music] I'm longing to see you, to hold you, to put my arms around you. I'm longing to touch you, oh God. Oh God, I want to put my hand upon your shoulder, my eyes to meet your eyes [Music] to put my arms all around you, my love, place you by my time. [Music] Will you give me your all? [Music] Will you give me your all? [Music] Reserve that part for me, my love. Only you can share with me. And soon and very soon we'll be together. And soon and very soon we'll be talking. And soon and very soon we'll be walking together. Together. Give me your all today, my bride. Give me your all. Let me be by your side. Will you give me your all? Let me love you so dear. Will you give me your all? I'll take away your fears. Will you give me your all [Music] m It was for you I cried, for you I died, for you I raised from the dead. It was for you I lived. It was for you I give everything I am today. Now will you give me your all? Your all. Will you give me your all? Oh Lord God, [Music] your all. Sweetheart, I want your all. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Father, we worship you today, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's just raise our hands, can we? I'm going to let you go here shortly. We give you praise, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Father. Thank you, Father, for all that you mean to us today. Lord, if there's one who hasn't made that full commitment to you today, I'm afraid before they walk out these doors, smite their hearts with such conviction, Lord Jesus, they'll be able to surrender their all finally. Anything they've held back in that secret closet of their life, Lord, may they be able to give it to you and walk out of here with a greater determination to live for you, to serve you. but also to love you like they never have before. We worship you today, Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, heavenly father. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Brother Larry, let's sing together. I could still go free. Let's sing this together before we go. Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is, but exhorting one another to do what? To come together. Exhorting one another. Carol and I was privileged yesterday to be able to meet with some of the widows here at the church and just have a time of fellowship together. And many of them brought pictures and of their husbands that had passed. And each picture that was brought in on the table, my heart got heavier and heavier. And I stood there and looked at him and they wanted me to talk to them a little bit. And I tried to, but I just got so broke up. I could see it on their faces. And some of them talked to me before the little gathering and tears running down their eyes, longing for that resurrection. And how we can do it, cuz we're free. We're free. Let's sing it together. Lock me up in a prison. Let me sing it as we go. You can log Whoa. We won't be able to sing it there, will we? You can lock me up in a prison and throw away the key. You can take away my vision [Music] from these eyes that now can see. Sing it with me now. Deprive me of the food [Music] I need. even by [Music] know that I can still go free.
