[18:52] not a more fitting song not a more
[18:56] fitting scripture our hope is in the
[18:59] lord abraham believed in hoping it when
[19:03] there was no hope he still believed in
[19:05] hope because god gave him a promise i'm
[19:08] so thankful so thankful brothers sister
[19:10] where would we be tonight brother dan if
[19:12] we hadn't given this message this truth
[19:16] endtime truth we would be out there
[19:19] blindly autoseal but because he ordained
[19:22] in the electus he chose us we had
[19:23] nothing to do with it he said he saw we
[19:26] needed he placed our names there rather
[19:28] than just why shouldn't everybody just
[19:31] love the Lord just just you know brother
[19:36] man said it's it's it's it's good to be
[19:38] in church he said it's a joy to be in
[19:39] church under any circumstances I can
[19:43] only think of one circumstance it
[19:45] wouldn't be a joy to be there that's
[19:46] when I have to preach but I told Alice I
[19:49] said I believe I'll just stay home and
[19:51] stream tonight
[19:52] she said no that won't work
[19:56] so I'm just so happy to be here I'm just
[20:01] I am so thankful be a Christian brother
[20:02] sisters I hope you just see it on my
[20:06] face every time I come to service it's
[20:08] you know I've been here 11 12 years
[20:10] whatever like that it's just it's it's
[20:13] it's in here it's it's just not up here
[20:15] it's not because daddy spent $2,200 to
[20:19] to straighten my teeth that's because I
[20:20] got something down here thank God for
[20:23] that let's look in the scripture if you
[20:25] will tonight to Colossians chapter 1
[20:29] verse 25 through 27 while you stand him
[20:31] thank you brother Louie I've kind of
[20:39] started a little a series and I've been
[20:42] trying to get out of it but I can't but
[20:45] I partly did tonight
[20:46] I've been studying on four five six
[20:49] eight weeks I guess on this particular
[20:51] thought and Monday night the Lord really
[20:54] gave me the the specific direction to go
[20:57] with this thought
[20:59] it's kind of being you Israel the bride
[21:01] dizzle the bride you know Israel's
[21:02] journey type surprise journey and we
[21:04] looked at several things a lot of
[21:06] Israel's Wars and 144,000 different
[21:08] things and when we when we talk about
[21:10] Israel and we're not going to talk about
[21:12] sorry brothers we're just not going to
[21:14] get much in Israel because I had I've
[21:16] got five pages of things that's
[21:18] happening to Israel that I want to bring
[21:19] to you but if I brought that I can't
[21:21] really bring Christ the mystery of God
[21:23] revealed to you so I'm just gonna have
[21:25] to I'm gonna have to just lay that aside
[21:27] but we'll touch on a little bit but when
[21:29] we actually talk about Israel it's not
[21:31] just history but really it's modern
[21:33] events made clear by history by prophecy
[21:36] but when you think about what a miracle
[21:38] is for Israel to be restored you have
[21:42] you have you have Syria you've got every
[21:44] nation around Israel is its Arab and
[21:47] their whole purpose is destroy Israel
[21:49] from Egypt they got the ban radiancy
[21:51] don'want on see on one side is are there
[21:53] only really border of protection but
[21:56] whether it be all the other bordering
[21:58] nations they want it they want to
[22:00] destroy Israel that'd be like they'll be
[22:02] like Tennessee you know with North
[22:04] Carolina and Virginia and Kentucky
[22:05] they're all against Tennessee I think
[22:08] that's the way it is really if everybody
[22:09] hates Israel it's a miracle that they're
[22:12] even a nation but it's really scripture
[22:18] fulfilled I mean you know when you're
[22:21] looking like I was the other prophet he
[22:23] said I was their 2760 Israel shall
[22:25] blossom and bud and fill the face with
[22:27] the earth with fruit that's that's
[22:29] fulfilled and I was at 35 won the
[22:32] wilderness and the solitary place that's
[22:34] dryness and drought and desert she'll be
[22:36] glad for them and the desert place
[22:38] that's the lower part than they gave
[22:39] desert shall blossom like a rose
[22:41] that's fulfilled that's modern events
[22:44] made clear by prophecy I love just
[22:46] history but that's but Israel being a
[22:48] nation the one thing to see Israel being
[22:51] restored but what about the bride tree
[22:53] being restored
[22:54] that's the greater Rose of Sharon that I
[22:56] see the bride tree is being restored in
[22:58] this last day let's look in Colossians
[23:01] chapter 1 now this is of course the text
[23:04] that brother Graham took in Christ the
[23:06] mystery of God revealed and we're going
[23:08] to look at that a little bit tonight if
[23:10] the Lord will help us
[23:12] Colossians 1:25 Paul speaking wherefore
[23:15] I am made a minister according to the
[23:18] dispensation of God which is given to me
[23:22] for you to fulfill the Word of God even
[23:25] the mystery which has been hid from ages
[23:29] and from generations but now is made
[23:34] manifest to the who Saints not everybody
[23:38] the Saints 127 to whom also again not
[23:45] everybody to whom god would make known
[23:48] what is the riches of the glory of this
[23:51] mystery among the gentiles which is
[23:55] christ in you the hope of glory is
[24:01] Christ in you not Christ around you not
[24:06] Christ over you Christ in you the hope
[24:10] of glory
[24:10] let's pray Lord Jesus father such a
[24:14] glorious subject that message Christ the
[24:17] mystery of God revealed is one of the
[24:18] most tremendous messages the prophet has
[24:21] ever preached they're all tremendous the
[24:23] Lord I've just thankful for it's you
[24:25] give us understanding
[24:26] helped us Lord it's all by your election
[24:29] the Lord but we we desire after we got
[24:32] saved I know that the Bible teaches us
[24:34] that no man can this can seek God God
[24:36] seeks his own but once we are saved and
[24:38] filled with the Holy Ghost and our whole
[24:40] desire is to seek God it's altogether
[24:42] been changed I pray this you don't know
[24:44] what your server tonight get me out of
[24:46] the way and North the people to hear the
[24:47] words already known to give us
[24:49] understanding and leadership tonight
[24:51] we'd be careful to praise your we ask in
[24:52] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[24:54] everybody says amen you can be seated in
[24:57] the name of the Lord I want to talk if I
[24:59] could give it up title I want to
[25:01] continue a little bit with blessings in
[25:02] the homeland but if I give a subtitle I
[25:05] want to talk about the secret Kingdom
[25:08] the secret Kingdom I don't get all the
[25:12] secret we're going to get some dark
[25:14] mysterious secret kingdom well we will
[25:18] but when you think of that when we when
[25:20] you see where I'm going and just
[25:22] a little while you see where I'm going
[25:24] oh I'm just just I'm just happy to be
[25:28] here now this word mystery to whom God
[25:33] will make known what is the riches of
[25:35] the glory of this mystery
[25:37] this word is a very interesting word
[25:39] mystery it's not not even mentioned in
[25:42] the Old Testament at all it's actually
[25:44] mentioned 26 times in the New Testament
[25:46] 24 of those 26 times not just this
[25:49] interesting is if you look it up in the
[25:52] in fatik dialog the word mystery is
[25:54] always used the word secret so it's only
[25:56] 26 times in the New Testament mystery is
[25:59] even used and each of those 26 with
[26:01] exception of two actually in the
[26:03] original Greek it's used the word secret
[26:05] so when we talk about the mystery of God
[26:08] were talking about the secret of God so
[26:09] it's almost interchangeable well it is
[26:11] interchangeable and so Jesus in mark
[26:15] 4:11 the first time it was actually the
[26:19] first time the word mystery is used in
[26:21] the Bible Jesus himself spoke it and
[26:23] that's the only time he ever used the
[26:25] word three times the word mystery which
[26:27] is actually the word secret and Mark 411
[26:31] Jesus was explaining the parable of the
[26:33] of the sower he said that Jesus said
[26:35] unto them unto you it is given to know
[26:38] the secret the mystery unto you not
[26:41] everybody unto you the mystery of the
[26:46] kingdom of God but unto them now that
[26:48] you and they a mural within them's
[26:50] without but them that are without all
[26:53] things are done in parables and that's
[26:56] still yet in parables today because they
[26:57] don't understand it and that's and if
[27:01] you look it up in the emphatic dialogue
[27:03] says the same thing and he said it to
[27:04] them to you it is given this secret of
[27:06] the kingdom of God but to those without
[27:08] all things are given in parables now as
[27:11] I said to use this word three times no
[27:13] so what is the mystery of mysteries a
[27:15] secret and what is a secret we'll get
[27:16] that in just a minute but as you say
[27:18] well if you tell me what a secret is and
[27:19] it won't be a secret any longer
[27:21] well it isn't it isn't if I when we see
[27:25] the definition now how you say well is
[27:28] God just by by holding secrets or only
[27:32] giving his secrets out to certain people
[27:33] you say gods Justin what
[27:36] does he sovereign he does what he wants
[27:37] do you say well is it fair well is it
[27:41] fair when God said I loved Jacob hate
[27:43] Esau is it fair that God could bring -
[27:47] but that he actually could bring two
[27:48] million out of the bondage of the land
[27:51] of Egypt key bring him out you know and
[27:53] because of their unbelief they're lost
[27:55] all the old-timers 2 million of them
[27:58] brother man said not a one of them
[28:00] except for Josh when Kayla made it in
[28:01] yet he brought in the book of Jude said
[28:04] he saved him out and yet had to destroy
[28:06] him
[28:07] is that was that fair with God you can't
[28:12] say anything is unfair with God because
[28:14] he saw what he does what he wants - now
[28:17] this word mystery actually comes from a
[28:19] Greek word mysterion
[28:21] which means to shut the mouth to shut
[28:27] the man now I don't want to get off on
[28:29] that look at this word as the Greek
[28:32] lexicon mystery it's a hidden thing a
[28:37] secret a mystery generally mysterious
[28:41] religious secrets confided only to the
[28:43] initiated guess who's the initiated into
[28:46] the kingdom and not to ordinary mortals
[28:50] I'm just reading what they said a hidden
[28:53] or secret thing not obvious to
[28:55] understanding a hidden purpose or
[28:59] counsel with God the secret counsels
[29:02] which govern God is dealing with the
[29:04] righteous which are hidden from ungodly
[29:06] and wicked men but playing to the godly
[29:09] I see predestination written all over
[29:12] that definition wrote all over it now
[29:18] I'm going to make a mysterious statement
[29:21] here I'm going to prove it as we go on
[29:22] what was in the back part of God's mind
[29:25] before the foundation of the world you
[29:28] the bride the elected the chosen you are
[29:31] the fulfillment of what he had in the
[29:32] back part of his mind
[29:33] I want to make a Presbyterian shout
[29:37] right now
[29:38] that all doesn't make up everything if
[29:41] they if they had the understanding if
[29:42] they had the ears to hear and eyes to
[29:44] see but as brother Ben said in crisis
[29:47] and mystery I'll give you just a little
[29:48] let's just start with this paragraph one
[29:51] or two now God secret mystery we're
[29:55] talking about a secret Kenan go back in
[29:57] I trusted I challenged everyone go back
[30:00] and listen across the mystery again and
[30:02] again and again God's secret mystery he
[30:07] had before the world began now back in
[30:09] the back part of God's mind there was
[30:11] something that he was trying and was
[30:13] going to achieve and he had a motive in
[30:17] doing it in order to let himself be
[30:20] expressed in that wonderful we we think
[30:24] well Genesis 1:1 in the beginning but we
[30:27] had a prophet in issue in race it could
[30:29] take us back say before the beginning we
[30:32] never know nothing what was only after
[30:34] the beginning but what about before the
[30:36] beginning I'm just so thankful that we
[30:40] were given in you know and and as it's
[30:43] coming up through the body coming up
[30:44] through Luther Westland the Pentecost
[30:46] and the tongue age and I age and the
[30:48] seer in the prophet but the last faculty
[30:50] brother man said was the intelligence
[30:52] which is Christ himself Christ himself
[30:56] now in Christ revealing his own word
[30:59] paragraph 77 notice what he says see
[31:02] down through the age we started off from
[31:04] the foundation from the first church age
[31:06] when the seed went into the ground
[31:08] the complete seed then it come out and
[31:11] the feet Luther come out through Wesley
[31:13] then to the Pentecost of the tongues in
[31:15] the lips now it's the eyes prophetic of
[31:18] Malachi 4 and so forth and now there's
[31:20] nothing else left and too many people
[31:22] stop right there they stop right there
[31:26] but you don't stop right there and now
[31:28] there's nothing else left for it to come
[31:31] but him himself to step into that he
[31:36] himself because that's the last thing no
[31:40] one that brother Ram could say
[31:41] justification made way for
[31:43] sanctification Saints vacation Baden way
[31:45] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[31:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for
[31:49] what the Holy Ghost
[31:51] himself gotta realize what age we're
[31:54] living in is the person of Christ
[31:56] no wonder Iike that revelation 10 when I
[31:59] saw another mighty angel come down from
[32:01] heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[32:03] rainbow over his head remember the other
[32:05] natural of course time for this visual
[32:07] Israel you know focus on a natural land
[32:09] the bride is focused on a spiritual land
[32:12] is a restored type sobriety restored oh
[32:15] look at this parallel as we go a little
[32:18] farther as we said in our first quote
[32:20] now God's secret mystery had before the
[32:22] world began now back in the back part of
[32:24] God's mind there's something that is
[32:25] trying it was going to achieve now this
[32:28] is this is the last generation before
[32:30] the rapture God has taken six thousand
[32:33] years to achieve that has he done it
[32:35] well if he hadn't done it now he's not
[32:37] going to get it done because it's over
[32:39] it's about finished this is time for
[32:41] going up this is this is harvest time
[32:43] maturity time bride time after time if
[32:47] he hadn't done it when is he gonna do it
[32:48] pray tell me clusters 126 even the
[32:54] secret the mystery which God hid from
[32:56] ages and from generations but now made
[32:58] manifest to his saints in Revelation ten
[33:02] seven so familiar but in the days of the
[33:05] most of the seventh angel when he should
[33:06] begin to sound the mystery the secret
[33:08] should be finished I know but man says
[33:11] many times and it's true you know all
[33:13] the mysteries will be revealed but it
[33:15] doesn't say which they were but it's
[33:17] really talked about the mystery of God
[33:19] there is a mystery of God that's why I
[33:23] singular in revelations 10 seven the
[33:25] mystery of God should be finished or
[33:28] brought to maturity brother I'm sure we
[33:31] don't really understand the favor that
[33:34] we've been hearing in this generation
[33:35] the inside and the understanding and the
[33:37] revelations of the vision and the book
[33:40] being opened and receipts in our name in
[33:42] that book and all the wonderful things
[33:44] that we see what God has let us see in
[33:46] this generation well if we could just
[33:49] catch a hold of that what we're we
[33:51] really staying why we were given who we
[33:53] are how wonderful it is we'd want to
[33:57] have church ever and I said god I just
[33:59] thank you I praise you that's
[34:01] world is going to forgive me is going to
[34:03] hell in a handbasket I hate to say it
[34:05] but it's weird this this the world has
[34:07] gone as shot has gone but what he's done
[34:14] for us is just so wonderful being called
[34:17] and chosen being quick and justified
[34:19] spiritual ear excellent resurrected so
[34:22] realizing the secret of God should be
[34:23] finished in this day oh brother now look
[34:28] at notice in Revelation 3 7 they say
[34:30] because Val says I'm rich increase in
[34:33] goods and have need of nothing but I'm
[34:35] saying to you that you're rested
[34:37] miserable naked poor blind and don't
[34:40] know it so they thought they they
[34:43] thought they was in 1 Kingdom but
[34:45] actually they were in another Kingdom
[34:47] and you know the devil always always
[34:50] wants to mimic what God does he can't
[34:53] create but he can only pervert or mimic
[34:56] so why did that angel tribute by the
[35:00] band in the 10th vision for always
[35:01] trying to explain that second pool he
[35:04] said it only calls carnal impersonations
[35:06] he said I told you not to do that he
[35:10] explained it all the time because
[35:11] brother Brown loved the people who won't
[35:12] explain it but he said don't do it he
[35:15] said now this third pool said nobody
[35:17] won't know nothing about that I'll meet
[35:19] you in there he said you can't teach the
[35:22] Pentecostal baby supernational things
[35:23] they it's not for them it's not their
[35:26] age yet their age is over people want
[35:31] information but what they needs
[35:33] revelation
[35:34] I mean hey you you you we can rally
[35:38] around this message because of many
[35:40] things we because the book the prompt
[35:43] you can love the Prophet you can fall in
[35:45] love with information you can fall in
[35:47] love with the prosperity you can fall in
[35:49] love with the the leadership around the
[35:52] message you can follow there's a lot of
[35:54] things you can fall in love with but
[35:56] that's not what he Everton he told us he
[35:57] said you got to fall in love with Christ
[35:59] the whole thing is Christ
[36:01] Christ alone that's all it's about I
[36:04] don't care what they say it's all about
[36:06] Christ you go back in the Old Testament
[36:09] we'd be Moses disciples we'd be Moses
[36:12] and that's all they said the fairs where
[36:14] Moses disciple what did Moses say he
[36:16] spoke of me I'm Christ he's the one who
[36:19] spoke of me if you as Moses disciples
[36:22] You Know Who I am if you're if your
[36:25] brother Brown's disciple you know who
[36:26] Christ is he spoke of Christ he led his
[36:30] surprise he said I must decrease that he
[36:33] must increase that John said I must
[36:35] decrease and he must increase brother
[36:38] man said the same thing I've got to go
[36:39] off the scene so he could come forgive
[36:46] me I'm not gonna be able to bring this
[36:48] about Israel but I found so I am I am
[36:50] going to read this I actually typed it
[36:52] out I'm gonna read you maybe two three
[36:55] years down the road we'll get to it I
[36:56] don't know modern is wrong this what
[37:00] they said about modern Israel has become
[37:03] very secret let's put this up there I'm
[37:07] going to read this the addiction to
[37:10] secrets in modern Israel is a modern
[37:14] Israeli thing perhaps a result of the
[37:16] fact that after 2000 years of Exile the
[37:19] Jews finally have their own secret
[37:21] service underground hidden weapons and
[37:23] that the country is surrounded by
[37:25] nations dedicated to its destruction
[37:27] even for those who have no professional
[37:29] need to know of these matters there's a
[37:31] sense of security and knowing some
[37:33] secret and pride and telling the
[37:36] neighbors that your son is doing things
[37:38] in his national service quote that he
[37:40] can't even tell me about there's a
[37:43] radiance remember Israel the bride
[37:45] Israel the bride Israel Debray everyone
[37:49] I want everyone wants Oh secrets to
[37:50] remain secrets but everyone wants to be
[37:53] seen to be knowing something about them
[37:55] your net worth as an Israeli as measured
[37:58] by your secrets but of course secrets
[38:00] are the most volatile currency on the
[38:01] market so keep them secret the country
[38:06] is simply too small and crowded and
[38:08] filled with bases and secret units and
[38:10] weapons for you not to know and the
[38:12] longer you live and work in Israel the
[38:14] Israelis you know you yourself become
[38:17] part of the secret Kingdom Wow when I
[38:25] saw that I thought I've just pulled a
[38:27] lot off you yourself become a part of
[38:31] the secret Kingdom Israelis collect and
[38:34] squirrel away these little bits of
[38:36] information and only give them away to
[38:38] those who are also part of the Charmed
[38:42] Circle
[38:44] [Applause]
[38:48] hello charm circle
[38:52] hello charm circle to you it is given to
[38:58] know the mysteries of the kingdom of God
[39:00] but those that are out is still in
[39:03] parables can we go a little farther some
[39:07] things you just don't tell you know
[39:11] brother may I just say one time you said
[39:12] try not to know too much I'm talking
[39:14] about worldly information worldly gossip
[39:16] worldly this worldly that that's why I
[39:18] said pray for revelation you know I have
[39:20] to pray for information pray for
[39:22] Revelation you'll get plenty information
[39:27] Oh Lord for 4,000 years
[39:31] you had natural king to natural kington
[39:33] and brother Don he's just I mean he just
[39:35] got through on Wednesday night he said
[39:36] and I've been sitting on this earth for
[39:38] weeks I said okay Donnie just go ahead
[39:40] and preach it just go ahead and preach
[39:41] my sermon bill I just go ahead but he
[39:43] laid a good foundation John Kay preached
[39:46] it came preaching the kingdom of God as
[39:48] the ham John Pat baptized the king of
[39:51] this kingdom which was the second mercy
[39:53] seat the first one that was behind the
[39:55] veil second mercy seat was in Christ
[39:56] about three years later they kill the
[39:59] king temporarily corsa no resurrected
[40:01] but and his body raised up of God sent
[40:04] down the kingdom place the spiritual
[40:06] Kingdom in the heart of man the third
[40:07] emergency in the heart of man now since
[40:09] the new kingdom cometh not with others
[40:12] without observation or not with
[40:13] observation rather a ruler in Israel
[40:16] named Nicodemus he wanted to know how do
[40:18] you get in this kingdom how do you get
[40:22] in this kingdom
[40:23] you say it's not going to be a natural
[40:25] kingdom you got to be born of ordered
[40:27] blood and the spirit how do you get into
[40:30] this kingdom you telling us about so you
[40:33] see the whole thing is a mystery and
[40:35] that's why I said to use this word
[40:36] mysteries not even in the Old Testament
[40:38] in the old tent that wasn't needed in
[40:40] the Old Testament so only need it when
[40:43] this new kingdom is being set up now
[40:45] don't miss this now the very first time
[40:48] this word as I said the very first time
[40:50] Jesus himself used the word mystery the
[40:52] first time he's ever spoken in the New
[40:53] Testament and he said mark 4:11 and he
[40:56] said unto them unto you and I read this
[40:58] reading it unto you is given the mystery
[40:59] of the secret of the kingdom of God but
[41:02] unto them that are without all these
[41:04] things are done in parables now again in
[41:08] Christ the mystery God this great secret
[41:11] has always blinded the wisdom of the
[41:13] world his secret his mystery did blinded
[41:22] you know the preaching of the gospel
[41:24] opens the eyes of some blinds others
[41:27] it's not for them and that's why you
[41:30] know we want to witness everybody but
[41:33] it's not for them you know if you're led
[41:35] to it but don't just spread it out there
[41:37] do it you got to be led God's great
[41:41] secret is always blind to the wisdom of
[41:43] the world they can't get it they just
[41:45] don't understand it Satan don't
[41:47] understand did you hear what I said
[41:51] Satan don't understand it you think
[41:55] you've Satan really knew that Jesus
[41:57] Christ was the Messiah and was the
[41:59] Redeemer of the world war you think he
[42:01] would have killed him not on your life
[42:02] he didn't know it he didn't know so what
[42:05] is he is he is he the one is he not I
[42:06] don't know easy it's a different kind of
[42:08] it they didn't know it say that did not
[42:10] know that I thought he would have never
[42:12] killed him Satan don't understand it
[42:15] none of the rest of them understand it
[42:17] but those who are predestinated to
[42:19] understand it look what was once God's
[42:23] great secret great mysterious secret in
[42:26] his mind is now put in the hearts of the
[42:30] believers right now Christ is a mystery
[42:34] of God revealed that's our message
[42:36] that's our scriptures plushes 127
[42:40] that's our soul that's our focus that's
[42:42] our life Christ in you the hope of glory
[42:44] not for them not for any other
[42:47] generation now what was in God's mind
[42:54] before the foundations of world is now
[42:58] in the hearts of the believer
[43:01] what are we talking about I'm talking
[43:04] about not a natural land but a spiritual
[43:08] land not a natural Kingdom a spiritual
[43:11] Kingdom and I haven't get enough
[43:12] spiritual Kingdom you got to have
[43:14] kingdom nature what look what was once
[43:23] God's great secret great mysterious
[43:25] secret in his mind it's now putting the
[43:27] hearts of the believer that is the body
[43:30] of Christ what was God's once great
[43:34] secret in his mind before the foundation
[43:37] the world is now made manifest take of
[43:39] it I say think of it the fulfillment of
[43:44] 6,000 years of God's desire and is in
[43:47] his purpose and what he wanted to bring
[43:49] to pass is now only now in this
[43:51] generation being made manifest
[43:54] he said well Luther had that Holy Ghost
[43:57] a portion he said he had a different to
[43:59] the Holy Ghost Wesley a different of the
[44:00] Holy Ghost pinnacles a difference to the
[44:02] Holy Ghost but you have the Holy Ghost
[44:04] saw the the Holy Ghost himself the
[44:07] fullness of the word that's why we talk
[44:10] about a person must have a word birth a
[44:13] word birth say when I got the Holy Ghost
[44:16] when I was back in pretty coasts you may
[44:18] have but you've got it on your spirit
[44:20] you can't have a word birth to tell the
[44:21] world it's time for this generation oh
[44:24] brother that's just as plain as 2 plus 2
[44:27] is 4 Satan don't understand them the
[44:33] kingdom how do you know Jesus said
[44:34] except a man be born again he cannot
[44:36] even see or understand the kingdom of
[44:38] God it seems not born again so it's a
[44:42] don't understand the kingdom because
[44:43] he's not born again until you're born
[44:45] again you can't understand the kingdom
[44:48] that's why jesus jesus said it verily
[44:50] verily I say me except to me if you want
[44:52] to be a born of the water flesh you said
[44:55] you can't even understand the kingdom of
[44:57] God what we have been given oh brother
[45:07] Matthew 3 1 in those days Came John the
[45:11] Baptist preaching in the wilderness of
[45:12] Judea and he said now he's Johnson the
[45:16] forerunner of the Messiah ok
[45:18] he's going to full run this Messiah was
[45:21] just the Messiah is going to introduce
[45:23] his new kingdom
[45:24] so here's John preached in the
[45:26] wilderness and what does he say he says
[45:29] repent but it wouldn't be the dawn he'd
[45:32] sell out this still thought okay go
[45:34] ahead go ahead
[45:35] repent for the kingdom of God kingdom of
[45:38] heaven is at hand
[45:41] John no he was a forerunner of this
[45:43] month this Messiah this king but he
[45:45] didn't know who he was but John was
[45:47] given a sign and that sign was when the
[45:50] Spirit of God descends on him as a dove
[45:52] and remains brother when I forgive me
[45:57] for saying it again with brother Don he
[45:58] brought that out I was wondering you
[45:59] know had John the bath filled the Holy
[46:01] Ghost from his mother's womb you know
[46:02] but the Holy Ghost was given and he just
[46:04] kind of explained that
[46:05] thank God I thank God thank God for the
[46:07] fivefold ministry the Holy Ghost wasn't
[46:10] giving it up but the secret is at rest
[46:11] on him it remained it on him
[46:13] he could go on the prophets and come off
[46:15] could go on the prophet come on
[46:17] but Jesus was the first of that new
[46:18] creation now it remains on the
[46:20] individual he made a way that the Holy
[46:23] Ghost could remain on people not go and
[46:26] leave it and come and leave it but
[46:27] remain this was the key to the New
[46:31] Kingdom
[46:32] the Spirit of God the Holy Ghost could
[46:34] now remain on a person not come and go
[46:36] oh the first of this narration in a new
[46:41] new race where the new generation paving
[46:43] the way for the for the birth of the cry
[46:45] for the birth of the church rather had
[46:47] Pentecost now remember they still had
[46:49] the mindset of a natural kingdom but you
[46:52] know John is trying to he's trying to
[46:53] bridge the gap a few words that repent
[46:55] for the kingdom of heaven is a hand
[46:57] they couldn't catch the transition like
[47:01] in but they said you know we want a king
[47:02] anyhow like in the days of Saul you
[47:04] don't need a king but we want a king
[47:05] anyhow John's saying repent but we want
[47:08] a natural king of many hell no matter
[47:10] what he said we want a natural Kingdom
[47:12] because that's what with us all we know
[47:14] Moses Moses Moses Moses time went on
[47:19] about three years later Peter on the day
[47:21] opinion but well before that even Jesus
[47:23] they maintenance had said they couldn't
[47:25] catch that revelation and Jesus himself
[47:27] says the same thing
[47:29] repent time went on three years later
[47:33] Peter on the day of Pentecost what does
[47:35] he say repent John says it jesus said
[47:44] Peter said in acts 2:38 it must be
[47:48] something to it I mean if you're giving
[47:51] the introduction to the new kingdom and
[47:52] it's one word repent brother that's got
[47:55] to be some foundational something there
[47:57] that we need to catch a whole - now this
[48:00] is a first step in this new kingdom acts
[48:02] 2:38 now I ask you why is acts 2:38 hid
[48:06] been here for 1,900 years why does the
[48:10] devil hate acts 2:38 why denominations
[48:13] hate it they won't preach it and don't
[48:15] use it I'll tell you why the devil hates
[48:18] acts 2:38 because it's a key to the
[48:20] kingdom it's a key to the kingdom it's
[48:25] the key of the entry into this kingdom
[48:27] when John was introducing the King he
[48:30] preached repent when Peter was
[48:32] introducing the kingdom he preached
[48:34] repent it's such a simple verse for yet
[48:36] very few people really understand what
[48:38] does that mean and we've got by God's
[48:41] help tonight I'm gonna help you
[48:42] understand when Jesus was preaching the
[48:46] kingdom in Matthew 4:17 from that Jesus
[48:50] himself said the same thing from that
[48:52] time Jesus began to preach and say
[48:54] repent for the kingdom of heaven is at
[48:57] hand
[48:58] John preached Jesus preached it Peter
[49:01] preached it guess what we preach it
[49:09] they say well say well I repeated I told
[49:13] God I was sorry got baptized in water
[49:15] then immediately God gave me the Holy
[49:17] Ghost no no no no no no no no no it's
[49:21] not that way it's not quite that simple
[49:23] I'd like I wish it was just you know
[49:25] just God I'm sorry get baptized work got
[49:28] the Holy Ghost boom just like that you
[49:34] know why you got too much this black dog
[49:37] too much black dog in the way and we'll
[49:40] show you why we got too much black dog
[49:42] in the way okay
[49:44] too much black dog most people don't
[49:49] really truly repent listen to me I'm
[49:54] going to help some people you know you
[49:58] say are there people in the congregation
[49:59] I don't have the Holy Ghost absolutely
[50:01] and remember now even the foolish
[50:04] virgins they all claim to have the Holy
[50:08] Ghost they all claim to have all young
[50:12] people middle-aged old people this is
[50:16] what I'm gonna tell you is really
[50:17] serious stuff because the devil is going
[50:21] to tell you you've got the Holy Ghost
[50:22] when you don't have it and the devil
[50:23] also tell you you don't have it when you
[50:25] do have it so you got to know how to
[50:28] discern how how did how deceiving what
[50:32] the devil is showing or telling you or
[50:34] giving you a feeling or some emotion or
[50:37] some experience that you felt and some
[50:44] might not really understand acts 2:38
[50:45] but with the help of God tonight we're
[50:47] going to understand it you must be born
[50:49] again paragraph 67 let's start with this
[50:52] one don't fail to get this quote don't
[50:55] fail to get this quote right here you
[50:57] must be bored yes to be born again you
[51:00] must go through a process of death
[51:04] everything does you take a grade of corn
[51:07] if a corn expects ever to live again
[51:09] it's got to die first if a grain of
[51:13] wheat ever expects to live again it's
[51:14] totally impossible for that coal
[51:16] that weed that flower that tree the
[51:18] grass defensible everything that expects
[51:21] to live again must die first then how
[51:26] are you going to escape it
[51:27] you've got to die first you've got to
[51:31] die die out to yourself die to
[51:34] everything so that you can be born again
[51:37] you've got to do that if you don't die
[51:40] you can never live again don't fail to
[51:44] get this quote and we're going to give
[51:47] you several more you've got to die he
[51:52] said it three times you must die well
[51:54] you say it simply means to change one's
[51:56] mind that's right you changed your mind
[51:58] you say well I don't want to die but you
[52:02] got to change your mindset yeah I do
[52:04] want to die well I mean nobody wants to
[52:07] die but you got to change your mind
[52:09] because yeah I don't want to die
[52:11] God said I got to die okay I want to die
[52:17] you know make it brother say oh yes I'm
[52:19] making sense that's why most people
[52:23] don't really truly repent and I mean
[52:26] listen now we're going to go real deep I
[52:28] said well I repeat it all I know how to
[52:31] repair ok ok let's see but they just
[52:34] don't want to die Jesus died for you now
[52:39] you must die for him not to not to not
[52:43] to earn salvation no all I follows the
[52:48] same cycle death burial resurrection
[52:51] death burial resurrection doesn't fail
[52:56] no exceptions nowhere in nature death
[52:58] burial resurrection John 12:24 Jesus
[53:02] speaking barely barely I said to you
[53:04] except except a corn of wheat fall into
[53:07] the ground and die it abideth alone but
[53:11] if it die it bringeth forth much fruit
[53:13] Jesus now he's saying he is the king of
[53:16] the kingdom he said and except except
[53:19] that corner we any natural grain or that
[53:23] grain didn't know that seen your heart
[53:24] same thing if it about if it don't die
[53:28] as in case of you it'll just stay
[53:30] dormant well I don't want to get ahead
[53:34] of myself it's gonna die
[53:36] as long as the seed stays in the seed
[53:38] package it's not going to its Dermott
[53:40] eyes but it can stay in that seed
[53:43] package for years what about the they
[53:45] found corn or whatever in the Garner's
[53:47] is either long as it stays dry it still
[53:49] Germa ties but until it's put in good
[53:53] ground you can buy some flower seeds you
[54:00] keeping that put them in a drawer it
[54:02] them seeds will do this they'll say for
[54:04] years there's dermatitis there's life in
[54:07] them but they ain't going anywhere
[54:09] because it's abiding alone until it's
[54:14] placing the good ground so it can die
[54:16] and rot
[54:17] it'll never bring forth life let's look
[54:19] at another one you must have going to
[54:21] get paragraph 73 you see what I mean now
[54:23] you are dead now how dare are you we're
[54:27] gonna find out how dead you you got to
[54:29] die now how dead are you going to be our
[54:31] souls now listen alright we're talking
[54:34] about the soul now because your flesh is
[54:36] not it's not redeemed and not redeemable
[54:39] until we get a new body you got one
[54:42] thing that can be redeemed us your soul
[54:44] you got ten outlets as against you see
[54:46] taste feel smell hear constant recent
[54:48] managed memory fixing your tent against
[54:50] you one for you the black dog you got to
[54:53] seem like he's a whole lot bigger but
[54:56] graters he this wouldn't you this is the
[54:58] world you see what I mean now you're
[54:59] dead our souls are placed upon the
[55:01] divine judgment that is that's brass
[55:03] when our souls is placed upon an altar
[55:06] of divine judgment what was the penalty
[55:09] what was the penalty when when animal
[55:12] was placed on the altar what was the
[55:14] penalty for the animal death and you and
[55:18] when you lay yourself upon the altar of
[55:20] God which is pronounced death upon the
[55:22] sinner
[55:23] how can you raise from there alive in
[55:25] sin if God accept if God accepted the
[55:29] sacrifice is it clear now you die
[55:33] you actually are consumed and you're
[55:35] petrified
[55:39] you know what I've been to the Petrified
[55:42] Forest where's it in Arizona where's
[55:44] Harvey Arizona I got there years ago and
[55:48] I've seen all them petrified trees they
[55:50] laid there for hundreds and hundreds a
[55:52] year and they've actually laid there so
[55:54] long they've become petrified they've
[55:56] become stones stones little stones you
[56:03] lay there so long till you die you're
[56:05] petrified and be yeah what a petrified
[56:08] piece of wood it's it's as hard as a
[56:10] rock

[56:28] left to you but just this form if you're
[56:33] dead and petrified there's nothing else
[56:34] but just this form because see you got
[56:38] to die to yourself every principal ever
[56:40] desire ever focus everything that's in
[56:43] your heart that's got to die the flesh
[56:45] don't change this lesson don't change
[56:46] I'm in the same old rotten temple that I
[56:48] lived in when I was when I was a sinner
[56:49] 16 the old evil things I did is 16 to 18
[56:52] I live in the same house he's got a new
[56:55] control tower this new control tower

[57:12] king got a new control tower you've got
[57:15] a new leader you've got a new headship
[57:18] you've got somebody telling you what to
[57:20] do when you tell him what to do there's
[57:24] no more left in you but just this form
[57:26] that you're standing in like the brass
[57:28] serpent like Christ was when he took him
[57:31] dead and cold off the cross you're dead
[57:34] because why you're on God's altar of
[57:37] judgment now when you come to God you
[57:40] just might as well know when you come to
[57:42] God
[57:42] you're on God's altar judgment if you're
[57:45] not willing to be that's to accept that
[57:48] sacrifice of Christ the Lamb
[57:51] he died in his flesh so that you could
[57:54] be redeemed of your sin you got to die
[57:56] to yourself you must die
[57:59] you're on God's altar of judgment what
[58:01] is his judgment when the judge has
[58:03] passed his sentence what is the sentence
[58:05] of his penalty death and when you place
[58:08] your soul upon that altar a judgment
[58:09] it's death to you now do you get it how
[58:15] many of us have been petrified in here I
[58:17] hope all of us if you're not that dead
[58:21] we got to get that dead you got to die
[58:25] until there's nothing left but to Christ
[58:29] let's go a little farther one unity of
[58:32] the God in the church paragraph 45 God's
[58:35] kingdom is not of this earth God's
[58:38] kingdom is in our hearts did you hear
[58:40] that they wanted a natural kingdom they
[58:43] didn't get it out God was trying to
[58:45] introduce to that my spiritual Kingdom a
[58:47] kingdom nature a different kind of
[58:49] Kingdom God's kingdom is in our hearts
[58:51] it's the spiritual Kingdom that we're
[58:53] born into
[58:54] jesus said the kingdom of God comes but
[58:56] not without violence and the kingdom of
[59:01] God is within you the Holy Spirit God's
[59:03] kingdom moving in a man and governing
[59:06] and control of him that's the kingdom
[59:08] think of a friends every every birth is
[59:11] a mess before a seed can actually bring
[59:16] for life that's he's going to die and
[59:18] that's he's got to rot it's got to
[59:22] follow to the earth the moisture the
[59:24] ground has got to swell it up and it's
[59:26] got a rot before it can explode open and
[59:29] bring forth life usually you got to die
[59:33] usually when a man dies it's a result of
[59:36] a lot of violence now God's asking for a
[59:42] spiritual suicide
[59:47] I don't where ever you got saved I don't
[59:49] know you know if you out in the
[59:51] cornfield at the altar you know on the
[59:52] workplace doesn't matter where you got
[59:53] saved but you got to die you're gonna
[59:58] die if your seat listen if your seat of
[59:59] God you're gonna die
[1:00:01] and if you're not willing to die
[1:00:04] yourself and commit spiritual suicide
[1:00:06] then God's going to kill you and it
[1:00:08] becomes homicide but you're going to die
[1:00:11] come on one way they're not and I'm
[1:00:13] gonna a non seat there's nothing too
[1:00:15] quick but if your seat but if you're
[1:00:17] saying you're going to die either you're
[1:00:18] going to let here you're going to die
[1:00:20] yourself and you're gonna let God kill
[1:00:21] you some come easy and some come hard
[1:00:24] which way do you want it you know I'd
[1:00:30] rather take my judgment on this side you
[1:00:32] know some people want to take it over
[1:00:33] there I won't mind a pass first I want
[1:00:36] to take my judgment right here you know
[1:00:38] either you die here or let God kill you
[1:00:41] if you're seeing which one you won't
[1:00:43] take your pick
[1:00:45] if your seat is gonna get you one way or
[1:00:47] the other but remember you said well
[1:00:49] they did forget that gives me a license
[1:00:52] to prolong it well it made but you may
[1:00:54] not be seen I wouldn't wait too long I
[1:00:59] wouldn't take a chance on it you've got
[1:01:04] to place yourself on that altar and die
[1:01:06] amen now you just take your pick
[1:01:08] now remember if your guard CDs gonna get
[1:01:11] you one way the other said he's gonna
[1:01:12] get you but listen if you've been around
[1:01:15] this message for so many years and you

[1:02:38] you it help me okay repent now be
[1:02:43] baptized we don't have to go through
[1:02:44] baptism that's pretty clear water
[1:02:46] baptism is an outward show I use worst
[1:02:50] show because that's no Hollywood it's an
[1:02:52] outward observance of an inward work
[1:02:55] you're actually showing you know brother
[1:02:57] mem said water baptism induction into a
[1:02:59] fellowship spiritual baptism induction
[1:03:01] to the kingdom you know basically it's
[1:03:02] an hour show showing you know the people
[1:03:04] that truly something's happened in my
[1:03:06] heart I got saved that's Christ in my
[1:03:07] heart he give
[1:03:08] forgive me our sins and so you're
[1:03:09] baptized but it's a commandment now and
[1:03:13] then and you shall receive the gift of
[1:03:15] the Holy Ghost and what is a gift of the
[1:03:17] Holy Ghost not tongues gift the Holy
[1:03:19] Ghost eternal life okay now now the big
[1:03:22] question is now brother Terry now the
[1:03:25] big question after I've repented after
[1:03:28] I've been baptized water how long do I
[1:03:30] have do I have to wait to get the Holy
[1:03:31] Ghost
[1:03:32] Wow what a question if anybody ever
[1:03:38] thought that young people middle-aged
[1:03:40] people
[1:03:41] people that struggle down fear do I have
[1:03:42] it doing on everybody don't have it
[1:03:48] people been around this message for
[1:03:50] years near just fell away they didn't
[1:03:52] have it preachers that preach this
[1:03:54] message for years fell away they didn't
[1:03:56] have it preachers in this preaching this
[1:04:00] pulpit before Fela wait they didn't have
[1:04:01] it might as well face effects didn't
[1:04:03] have it just that simple now how long do
[1:04:09] you have to wait but I want to ask you a
[1:04:14] question I'm going to answer your
[1:04:16] question with a question how long do I
[1:04:19] have to wait after I've repented be
[1:04:20] baptized to be filled with the Holy
[1:04:21] Ghost
[1:04:22] well I ask you this question how long
[1:04:25] does a cucumber have to stay in the acid
[1:04:27] become a pickle all brother Terry well
[1:04:36] it's one word for it's very simple that
[1:04:39] cucumber you put it in that acid it's
[1:04:41] got a state in that acid that cucumber
[1:04:43] because they in that asset one word
[1:04:45] describes it until until entail untell
[1:04:52] how many I don't know until it doesn't
[1:04:55] matter how long until the whole thing is
[1:04:58] I tell some comes quick some comes long
[1:05:04] sum comes easy comes some comes hard but
[1:05:09] you got to stay there until the whole
[1:05:11] secret is on tell
[1:05:15] now the untell really is up to you you
[1:05:19] so what about just oh it's really up to
[1:05:22] you it's really up to you I'll show you
[1:05:28] why it's up to you you said well it got
[1:05:29] dogs I'm pre dancer okay okay I know you
[1:05:31] said free dancing me too
[1:05:35] but how long how long was face the time
[1:05:38] before as many people as many many many
[1:05:40] years they got the Holy Ghost after this
[1:05:43] baptized why there's a reason you must
[1:05:48] be born again look at this one paragraph
[1:05:50] 76 now your soul is laid upon the altar
[1:05:53] of God
[1:05:53] your soul is laid upon that altar of
[1:05:56] God's brass judgment then God receives
[1:05:59] the sorts they sacrifice now it shows
[1:06:05] that you haven't received yet if it does
[1:06:07] if you're still alive in the world God
[1:06:11] never took it now we're getting on
[1:06:13] something right now I can eyes I see the
[1:06:15] the brains are beginning to roll the
[1:06:18] spiritual wheels are turning now now God
[1:06:24] never took it now you people talking
[1:06:27] about getting the Holy Ghost and how you
[1:06:30] have to wait so long here you are
[1:06:33] I told you a good right in front of me
[1:06:35] until God receives that sacrifice until
[1:06:39] it's late on his judgments there on ko
[1:06:42] list I said on tail and tail until until
[1:06:46] his judgment has actually killed your
[1:06:48] senses you might say well I'm going to
[1:06:50] turn a new page that idiot well I know I
[1:06:53] used to smoke I'm gonna quit smoking
[1:06:54] that still isn't it until God receives
[1:06:57] that sacrifice on his breath on brass
[1:06:59] altar his altar of judgment what is his
[1:07:03] judgment death death I'm saying again
[1:07:06] death gotta be willing to die everybody
[1:07:12] wants to go to heaven but nobody wants
[1:07:13] to go by Calvary that still isn't in
[1:07:18] care of God receives that sacrifice on
[1:07:21] this brass altar his altar is judgment
[1:07:23] what is his judge
[1:07:24] - that's the penalty the soul that
[1:07:27] sinneth that remains in that shall die
[1:07:29] don't care what you've done you want a
[1:07:37] scripture Peter speak him and we are
[1:07:40] acts 5:32 and we are witnesses of these
[1:07:43] things and so is also the Holy Ghost
[1:07:46] whom God has given to them that obey Him
[1:07:52] have you fully obeyed fully obeyed I'm
[1:07:57] not saying your life is spotless we're
[1:07:59] not talking about that I'm talking about
[1:08:01] fully obeyed and repentance repentance
[1:08:03] true repent on the kingdom of God he's
[1:08:07] preaching the kingdom of God he's
[1:08:08] showing how to get in the kingdom the
[1:08:11] first thing is you got to repent then
[1:08:14] you got to know what true repentance is
[1:08:17] it brings death
[1:08:19] bring separation it brings a reversal it
[1:08:23] brings it turning around or means it
[1:08:25] brings a new desire you went that way
[1:08:29] now you're going this way about-face
[1:08:31] that's the truth that that's the truth
[1:08:33] understanding of repentance you must
[1:08:35] change you must die lay offs in church
[1:08:42] eights paragraph 360 in his own personal
[1:08:45] life continuing with his health speed of
[1:08:47] Christ he overcome by obedience to the
[1:08:50] Word of God Hebrews 5 7 says who in the
[1:08:53] days of his flesh when he had offered up
[1:08:55] prayers and supplications with strong
[1:08:57] crying and tears unto him that was
[1:09:00] awesome that was able to save him from
[1:09:02] death and was heard in that he feared
[1:09:05] though he were a son yet he learned the
[1:09:08] obedience by the things which he
[1:09:09] suffered and being made perfect he
[1:09:11] became the author of eternal salvation
[1:09:13] unto all them that obey Him he purchased
[1:09:20] salvation for all those that obey Him
[1:09:23] what is it what in what was he a beauty
[1:09:26] - he was obedient to the word what do
[1:09:28] you got - Beauty to the word now listen
[1:09:33] let's look at Abraham's life just a
[1:09:34] minute and we'll just see if God
[1:09:36] performed the same
[1:09:37] trial today bruh ham did for Abraham as
[1:09:41] we've got to be we've got to die we've
[1:09:44] got to be on his altar now Abraham
[1:09:49] paragraph 29 Abraham after he was called
[1:09:52] out of the land of the Chaldeans in the
[1:09:54] city of Ur he became a pilgrim a
[1:09:56] sojourner and then God called him after
[1:09:58] he had proven after he had proven after
[1:10:01] they had proven that he was going o to
[1:10:05] take God at His Word then what God did
[1:10:09] then was give him a sign that he had
[1:10:12] accepted him he gave him a sign he
[1:10:16] called him years ago but then later he
[1:10:21] gave him a sign what was a sign that he
[1:10:24] accepted him accept his faith and he
[1:10:28] circumcised him and he circumcised
[1:10:30] instrument all this household and now
[1:10:32] you see when when you are called out
[1:10:34] first you go through a trial to see if
[1:10:37] you're really gonna go on did you hear
[1:10:39] what I said I didn't write it I'm just
[1:10:45] reading it you go through a trial to see
[1:10:49] if you're really going to go home and
[1:10:50] then God and then God gives you the Holy
[1:10:53] Ghost which is the sign that he has
[1:10:55] accepted your faith that you profess to
[1:10:59] that you profess to have in him you
[1:11:04] follow me now he's going he's going to
[1:11:06] accept it he didn't get Lord help me oh
[1:11:15] Jesus
[1:11:18] let's look at the ex paragraph 31 and I
[1:11:22] see super sister gave the enemy now when
[1:11:24] we receive Christ as our Savior then if
[1:11:27] we're sincere in that did you hear that
[1:11:31] if we're sincere in that then God gives
[1:11:35] us gives us a sign that he has received
[1:11:38] our faith in Christ by giving us the
[1:11:42] seal of circumcision which is the Holy
[1:11:44] Ghost he gave Abraham the natural sign
[1:11:47] of the seal of circumcision which was in
[1:11:49] their flesh
[1:11:50] a sign that he received his faith we get
[1:11:52] a spiritual sign of circumcision which
[1:11:55] is the Holy Ghost which God has received
[1:11:57] our faith when we get the Holy Ghost and
[1:11:59] that is a sign that God has received
[1:12:02] your faith in what is your faith faith
[1:12:04] is a revelation God is saying now okay
[1:12:06] so we might come to the altar an instant
[1:12:09] in you you repent and everything well at
[1:12:11] two or three weeks later you know you
[1:12:13] just well you know that the emotion kind
[1:12:14] of wore off well God knew that when when
[1:12:17] he knew that three weeks he knew that
[1:12:19] that emotion would wear off I'm making
[1:12:24] sense tonight he knew that well what if
[1:12:28] it what what if he was truly sit I mean
[1:12:31] what if you was dead sincere I mean you
[1:12:33] know and you'd use you just literally
[1:12:34] died I mean this just don't happen too
[1:12:36] often but sometimes it does if God sees
[1:12:39] that said they're finished they're going
[1:12:41] on giving the Holy Ghost yes sir it
[1:12:45] happens but not too often why the black
[1:12:48] doll don't want to die just don't want
[1:12:51] to die especially in America too many
[1:12:54] worldly pleasures too many good well you
[1:12:56] know you can ask about any sin on street
[1:12:59] do you want to go to help no you want to
[1:13:01] go to heaven yell when you well I'm you
[1:13:03] know later on them will get saved sure
[1:13:05] that's that's yeah later on or get saved
[1:13:08] nobody wants to go to hell but the later
[1:13:12] on never comes because there's too many
[1:13:15] worldly pleasures too much too much in
[1:13:17] this world I want to do I don't really
[1:13:19] want to I don't want to serve God I've
[1:13:20] got I've got to go through my teen years
[1:13:21] since so my Wild Oats and I got to do
[1:13:24] this and I got to do that yeah you might
[1:13:25] end up hitting a telephone pole and you
[1:13:27] don't have that second chance you better
[1:13:31] do it now while you have the opportunity
[1:13:32] you ain't for you not even promised to
[1:13:35] go home tonight
[1:13:37] the Holy Ghost he's except now let's
[1:13:42] back up that e31
[1:13:43] then if he's if you're sincere in that
[1:13:45] then God gives us a sign they'd received
[1:13:47] our faith by Christ giving us a sealed
[1:13:49] circumcision which is the Holy Ghost
[1:13:51] that's the seal of Serket
[1:13:52] grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby
[1:13:53] you're sealed to the day of your
[1:13:55] Egyptian not to the next meeting but to
[1:13:58] the day of your addition that's right a
[1:13:59] piece in 430 now that's how we receive
[1:14:02] the Holy Ghost
[1:14:03] he thought about being serious in Si are
[1:14:06] you talking about how it God tested
[1:14:07] Abraham and I see let's look at
[1:14:09] paragraph II 32 and now you say oh I'm a
[1:14:12] believer and gods never give you the
[1:14:15] Holy Ghost , he's never recognized it
[1:14:19] yet
[1:14:19] you're just confessing that you believe
[1:14:23] but when all the doubt I'm not saying
[1:14:26] you're not a believer now
[1:14:27] in a certain portion you're a believer
[1:14:29] but when God has found favor you found
[1:14:32] favor with him rather and he recognizes
[1:14:34] you to be his child and he knows your
[1:14:37] heart and he sees your sincerity he
[1:14:41] knows all things are cut away from you
[1:14:43] then then then he seals you into the
[1:14:48] kingdom of God by the Holy Ghost it's
[1:14:51] right there brother it's just black and
[1:14:53] white proving to the world that he has
[1:14:56] accepted what you profess to have in him
[1:14:59] do you get it now
[1:15:02] go he says the same thing in future home
[1:15:05] said now when God accepts you says you
[1:15:07] don't accept the whole you don't accept
[1:15:09] him he accepts you because it's God's
[1:15:10] attribute God has to accept your faith
[1:15:13] God has to when you come to that point
[1:15:16] whatever it is I can't say what it is
[1:15:18] days months weeks years but whenever it
[1:15:23] comes to that point God says okay he's
[1:15:25] dead now just like just like look at
[1:15:27] Abraham okay he brings his child up to
[1:15:30] the mountain you know it's it's God's
[1:15:31] it's gonna give me a child he gave me a
[1:15:33] child but now he's telling me the
[1:15:34] killing I read he said you know he said
[1:15:36] I I know he's the promised lineage you
[1:15:38] know I know he's going to come through
[1:15:39] him but he said he's gonna kill him he's
[1:15:41] got to raise him up you know I mean he's
[1:15:42] just there all this thing to it but he
[1:15:45] still he said God said killing so I'm
[1:15:46] taking up the raises he says Abraham
[1:15:49] Abraham stop now
[1:15:53] now now I see that you really believe me
[1:15:56] now that I see God's got to give you the
[1:16:00] test we all got to be tested brother
[1:16:02] sister
[1:16:03] oh there's all different kinds of tests
[1:16:06] but when God sees that she really mean
[1:16:08] business with him that's when you get
[1:16:10] the Holy Ghost it's a secret Kingdom
[1:16:14] secret Kingdom you know he's just it's
[1:16:18] not for everybody you know let's go a
[1:16:21] little farther the cannery now we must
[1:16:24] listen you got it we must realize that
[1:16:26] I'm gonna hurry here not too much longer
[1:16:30] how deceiving this age is as I said I
[1:16:36] wish I wish I could believe it everybody
[1:16:39] in here has the Holy Ghost but rather
[1:16:40] than I'm said in every church three
[1:16:41] kinds of believers I mean you know three
[1:16:43] kinds of believers even the foolish
[1:16:47] virgin said you know I got the old
[1:16:49] I don't want think it listening I don't
[1:16:54] want to take any chances
[1:16:55] I do not want to take any chances I mean
[1:16:58] you know brother Burt if I got to die
[1:17:02] suicide or hummus I don't care how it is
[1:17:05] I want to die I mean I want to be dead I
[1:17:07] mean my whole focus is Christ it's got
[1:17:11] to be that way you know about 25 months
[1:17:15] I've been in the mess about 35 years I
[1:17:17] guess it when we first come into the
[1:17:19] message we just we just believe that you
[1:17:21] know if you could receive that brother
[1:17:22] man said you know how what's the
[1:17:23] evidence the Holy Ghost when you can
[1:17:24] receive the message of the era well
[1:17:26] that's true but receiving is more than
[1:17:28] just oh well yes your y'all see God sent
[1:17:30] a prophet a man did more than that but
[1:17:33] we used to believe you know if you
[1:17:35] understand the pools and the thunders
[1:17:37] and and you know and the the church age
[1:17:39] messengers in the seventh seal well man
[1:17:41] you know you can understand you got it
[1:17:43] we found out that wasn't through those
[1:17:45] medium could preach the seals and
[1:17:46] thunders and pools everything else it
[1:17:48] didn't have it that's why I said I said
[1:17:50] well that's why the Pentecostals just
[1:17:52] cabbage down on tongues was the initial
[1:17:54] evidence he said I don't see witches and
[1:17:56] wizards and and devils and and he
[1:17:58] there's everybody else speaking tongues
[1:17:59] and don't have no Holy Ghost no it's not
[1:18:02] you I wonder what did Jesus say SS the
[1:18:05] king of the kingdom he said by their
[1:18:08] fruits you shall know them
[1:18:09] it ain't what you it ain't what you say
[1:18:12] it's not what you ver vocalize or what
[1:18:14] you profess oh yeah well I'm a priestess
[1:18:16] I'm born again on this end yeah what
[1:18:18] kind of life do you live what's the
[1:18:20] fruit of your life listen if you want to
[1:18:23] know what kind of tree it is you go out
[1:18:24] looking you don't look at the bark of
[1:18:26] the tree that might deceive you if it's
[1:18:27] got an orange on it's an orange tree
[1:18:29] it's got pecans on its a pecan tree or
[1:18:35] living an apricot or whatever by their
[1:18:40] fruits ye shall know the devil can
[1:18:44] impersonate anything he can purr purr
[1:18:46] say anything they're kids but he can't
[1:18:48] live the life the devil cannot live the
[1:18:51] life he cannot produce that kind of
[1:18:52] fruit he can't do it well you say what
[1:19:01] will you what were you doing let me just
[1:19:03] put it this way well I shall here's what

[1:19:09] Holy Ghost you may speak in tongues you
[1:19:11] may not you may shout you may not you
[1:19:15] may dance in the spirit you may not but
[1:19:18] there's one thing you will do you will
[1:19:21] bear the fruit of the Spirit and the
[1:19:23] fruit of fear is love joy peace
[1:19:25] long-suffering gentleness meekness
[1:19:27] patience temperance
[1:19:29] [Applause]
[1:19:32] you will bear the fruit of the Spirit

[1:19:37] Holy Ghost is the token

[1:22:57] to hold it over just I mean say look the
[1:23:01] Lord told me to say it so I'm just
[1:23:02] that's just the
[1:23:08] you must be born again let's look at
[1:23:11] this quote here and we close this second
[1:23:12] now there's no excuses he will have no
[1:23:19] eyes no eyes at all cannot in any other
[1:23:23] way no matter how great he is what his
[1:23:26] name is
[1:23:27] how big is how popular he is he cannot
[1:23:30] even understand the kingdom of God until
[1:23:32] he's born again so I ask you and I title
[1:23:42] this the secret Kingdom you can't even
[1:23:45] understand the kingdom until you're born
[1:23:47] again now how many people around the
[1:23:50] world that have a word birth
[1:23:53] percentage-wise
[1:23:54] just just a little so how many people
[1:23:57] really understand the kingdom it's a
[1:24:00] secret that's why he says unto you is
[1:24:03] given to know the secret for the
[1:24:04] mysteries but unto them that are out
[1:24:06] without this in parables are we
[1:24:10] following it's a secret kingdom but if
[1:24:14] you're ordained to see it you'll see it
[1:24:15] if you're ordained to be in it you'll be
[1:24:17] in it
[1:24:17] if you're ordained to see it you will
[1:24:19] understand it if you're ordained but
[1:24:22] before you can understand you're gonna
[1:24:23] die first before you can be part of it
[1:24:25] you're gonna die first if you want to
[1:24:27] die then get ready oh my but you will
[1:24:35] bear the fruit of this field I don't
[1:24:36] care what you didn't some things you
[1:24:38] might do you might not but you will bear
[1:24:39] the fruit of it five moments I'm close
[1:24:41] here's a focus across the ministry
[1:24:45] paragraph 395 what was once God's great
[1:24:48] secret great mysterious secret in his
[1:24:50] mind is now put in the hearts of the
[1:24:53] believer that is the body of Christ what
[1:24:57] was God's once God's once great secret
[1:25:00] in his mind before the foundation world
[1:25:02] is now manifest think of it yeah right
[1:25:05] before we close here
[1:25:06] I looked up brother man said when you
[1:25:08] receive the Holy Ghost and I just looked
[1:25:10] up when you receive the Holy Ghost what
[1:25:12] make take place so I copied down all the
[1:25:15] things that he said will happen now
[1:25:16] these are
[1:25:16] just attributes of receiving the holy
[1:25:18] ghost after you receive because this is
[1:25:20] just kind of the benefits of it I
[1:25:21] thought you'd enjoy this when you see
[1:25:23] the Holy Ghost you are a Christian when
[1:25:26] you receive the Holy Ghost you seek
[1:25:27] those things that pertain to God you
[1:25:30] when you receive the Holy Ghost every
[1:25:32] redemptive blessing belongs to you you
[1:25:35] are inside the veil you are protected
[1:25:38] from the outside plagues of Egypt each
[1:25:40] one of these days when you receive the
[1:25:41] Holy Ghost you have certain rights call
[1:25:43] for the enforcer then you then you
[1:25:46] become a witness when you receive a Holy
[1:25:49] Ghost
[1:25:49] his life his life will be manifested in
[1:25:52] you when you receive the Holy Ghost it's
[1:25:55] a finished work God has completed its
[1:25:57] panel at plan of salvation when you
[1:26:00] receive the Holy Ghost you have the
[1:26:01] token that's the literal life of Jesus
[1:26:03] Christ show us the father do more
[1:26:07] clothes and the way a Christian is when
[1:26:10] we are planted together in Christ Jesus
[1:26:12] who the exhaustible fountain of life
[1:26:15] were plenty of Christ and we just drink
[1:26:17] and drink and drink and push out
[1:26:18] everything when you become a Christian
[1:26:21] you have all these things and what else
[1:26:23] do you have everything we have need up
[1:26:25] for the earthly journey divine healing
[1:26:27] the power of God all these other things
[1:26:29] is in every individual in here that has
[1:26:32] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:34] for you are planted in Christ hallelujah
[1:26:36] the Holy Ghost baptism yes sir and
[1:26:39] everything you have need for of this
[1:26:41] life's journey even the rapture is right
[1:26:45] in you then hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:26:49] hallelujah praise the Lord I don't know
[1:26:51] your praises are already hallelujah
[1:26:55] praise the Lord everything you have need
[1:26:58] for in your earthly journey is in you
[1:27:00] then when you receive the Holy Ghost why
[1:27:02] wouldn't you want to die and get the
[1:27:04] Holy Ghost well I play around why was it
[1:27:06] well I don't know I don't know I know
[1:27:08] just come up and die or die on the job
[1:27:11] or die in the cornfield I don't care
[1:27:13] where you get the Holy Ghost
[1:27:14] just get it
[1:27:22] price the mystery 397 but God's great
[1:27:26] mystery what the eternal God had as the
[1:27:28] mystery was now has now been unfolded in
[1:27:32] Jesus Christ then given right down to
[1:27:35] his church
[1:27:35] what was once in God's mind is now in
[1:27:38] the body of Christ Jesus making love to
[1:27:41] the church his bride whispering what a

[1:28:43] that that little quotation that I read
[1:28:46] to you about Israel and the secrets I
[1:28:49] have thoroughly thoroughly enjoyed my
[1:28:54] study in Israel and it's just become so
[1:28:56] so more intriguing to me the miracle it
[1:29:00] is that but then Israel is actualization
[1:29:03] it's truly a miracle and you know just
[1:29:07] okay I'll just give you one cuz he's
[1:29:09] gone you know how do you find one before
[1:29:17] David ben-gurion was the first Prime
[1:29:19] Minister Israel when they become a
[1:29:23] nation in 1948 one thing David Berg
[1:29:27] Aryan had of course the military man but
[1:29:29] one thing he had he had a tremendous
[1:29:31] gift of leadership leadership and
[1:29:36] because Israel knew that see because
[1:29:40] Israel Palestine Jerusalem had been
[1:29:44] occupied for sixteen seventeen years
[1:29:46] with all kinds of people but the last
[1:29:48] hundred years you know the Turks had it
[1:29:49] for a long time than the most recent
[1:29:51] ones before they won their independence
[1:29:52] the British had it for twenty three
[1:29:54] twenty four twenty seventy years
[1:29:55] something like that and then finally the
[1:29:57] general aladeen they released it
[1:29:58] relinquished from the British you know
[1:29:59] and so forth but the Arabs you know
[1:30:01] controlled it for years and years and
[1:30:02] years and then when the Jews come in you
[1:30:05] don't start migrating back from Poland
[1:30:07] and rushing all around the world you
[1:30:08] know and the and the Zionist movement
[1:30:10] started the turn of the century and they
[1:30:12] all begin to migrate to Israel migrate
[1:30:14] to Israel come back to Israel you know
[1:30:16] and they just the Gaza it all down there
[1:30:17] they just they run out the Arabs in the
[1:30:19] end the Jews took over well you can you
[1:30:22] can understand why the the the
[1:30:24] Palestinians they call them in the in
[1:30:26] the air people they hate the Jews
[1:30:27] they're mortal enemies I'm when they
[1:30:30] come take their city but the thing about
[1:30:33] it is that's the only the only parcel of
[1:30:35] land on the earth that's promised
[1:30:37] anybody was that was Jerusalem was
[1:30:39] promised to the Jewish people God gave
[1:30:41] it gave them that land they they
[1:30:43] rightfully own that
[1:30:45] so they're just taking back what what
[1:30:47] was taken for them destroyed in AD 70
[1:30:51] but it was time that you know the
[1:30:53] Ezekiel 37 the dry bones you know that's
[1:30:56] the bribe it's Israel also and all these
[1:30:58] prophecies but before before and when
[1:31:01] the David beginning you know became the
[1:31:02] first Prime Minister what he did was
[1:31:05] that that they he knew that soon as they
[1:31:07] declared himself independent all these
[1:31:11] Arab nations are going to be five armies
[1:31:13] was done declare on war in Israel and
[1:31:15] Bundy they did and it's been that way
[1:31:17] ever since they fall five major Wars
[1:31:21] everyone I'm supernaturally I told you
[1:31:23] about here last time we talked about how
[1:31:24] the gold in my ear she called Ronald
[1:31:27] Reagan the middle Knight says if you
[1:31:28] don't in the Yom Kippur War if you don't
[1:31:30] help us in Israel's gone the greatest
[1:31:32] airlift is we've ever known he's sitting
[1:31:34] days he said the greatest amount of
[1:31:36] Tanks the weapons you know the Israel
[1:31:37] put them right on front lines and they
[1:31:39] won that war but here's here's an
[1:31:42] another thing that I didn't know about
[1:31:43] when David procurement they knew they
[1:31:46] needed gun this is right when they
[1:31:47] before they won their independence so
[1:31:49] David ben-gurion sins this woman to the
[1:31:52] United States her name is gold in my ear
[1:31:54] she was actually she was the David
[1:31:57] ben-gurion was the first prime minister
[1:31:59] but she was like the Israeli head of the
[1:32:02] Israeli Department so he sends her to
[1:32:05] the United States to solicit funds so
[1:32:08] they can purchase weapons so go to my
[1:32:11] ear this is true story she comes to she
[1:32:14] lands on the airplane gets off airplane
[1:32:16] in New York thirty with ten dollars in
[1:32:19] her pocketbook thirty days later she
[1:32:22] goes back to Israel with fifty million
[1:32:27] Israel knows how to do it

[1:32:34] brothers not forget who it was
