[15:53] very large men's wedding band was found
[15:56] in the Fellowship Hall audio booth.
[16:00] Please come to the library to claim
[16:01] that. So remember
[16:03] that. Brother John Gresham from Fort
[16:06] Wayne, Indiana is asking for prayer for
[16:08] he and his family. He would also like to
[16:11] express how much he loves his brothers
[16:12] and sisters at Word of Life. So, may God
[16:15] bless the Gresham family tonight. Sister
[16:18] Brandy Anon says, "Dear Word of Life,
[16:20] please keep my sister and dad in your
[16:22] prayers. My dad is on his way to uh
[16:25] Riverton and my grandmother is having
[16:28] surgery on her heart. She's 92. So, we
[16:32] want to remember that prayer request
[16:33] that the Lord would be mindful of that.
[16:35] Sister Angie Brown has an urgent
[16:37] unspoken prayer request. would
[16:39] appreciate your prayer. So, let's
[16:41] remember that tonight. Due to unforeseen
[16:44] circumstances, the back air conditioning
[16:46] unit will not be on tonight. We
[16:48] apologize for the inconvenience. And I
[16:50] know some of you people in the back are
[16:52] saying, "Praise be to the Lord." So, for
[16:56] all that shows concern over that, the
[16:58] Lord bless you. The library will be
[17:00] closed on Thursday, April the 17th,
[17:03] 2025. Remember that.

[17:20] vacation Bible school in the library if
[17:22] they will be attending. We need to uh
[17:26] get this information for ordering our
[17:28] materials. Brother Michael Bailey sends
[17:30] that in. And this, you might have
[17:31] noticed some construction going on when
[17:33] you entered the parking lot this
[17:35] evening. That's the new playground area
[17:38] for our children. Now, until that is
[17:40] completed, absolutely. It's off premises
[17:43] to uh children. Don't be around it
[17:46] because we don't want you to get hurt.
[17:48] And uh I'm not going to tell you what
[17:50] Brother Michael Begley said, but it was
[17:52] very drastic. So, just don't be over
[17:55] there until it's completed. So, remember
[17:57] all these announcements, all of our
[17:59] prayer requests. Aren't you glad you're
[18:00] serving a great big God tonight? Do you
[18:03] love him better than everything in the
[18:04] world? Is he better to you than anybody
[18:07] else in the world? I believe we could
[18:09] all say that tonight. Let's stand to our
[18:11] feet. If you have an unspoken prayer
[18:12] request tonight, just by raising up your
[18:14] hand, we'll just commit all these things
[18:16] unto the Lord. Let's sing that chorus
[18:18] together one more time. We've been made
[18:20] more than conquerors tonight. Brother
[18:22] Rob, if you get ready to pray tonight
[18:24] over these prayer needs, we just commit
[18:25] them all under the Lord. We've been made
[18:29] more than conqueror.
[18:32] [Music]
[18:34] We're overcomers in this
[18:40] life. Yes, we've been
[18:43] made
[18:47] victorious through the blood of Jesus
[18:55] Christ. Amen. Want to say I appreciate
[18:57] brother Rob Weber and his family.
[19:01] Amen. Amen. just give our our brother a
[19:05] rose while he can smell it tonight. But
[19:07] where brother Rob
[19:09] was and where all of us were at one
[19:12] time, but where brother Rob was and
[19:14] where the Lord has brought you to,
[19:17] buddy? That's right. You're on a
[19:19] mountain top, buddy. We love him, don't
[19:21] we? Amen. God bless you, my brother.
[19:23] Appreciate you. Just so
[19:26] thankful. Uh I do want to say that this
[19:28] would be the the time that we head off
[19:30] to camp. And so for 15 years, I've been
[19:33] going to Louisiana camps. I want to it's
[19:36] just a a sweet feeling to be here and
[19:38] and see how God's continued to move. But
[19:40] I would remember them and I told them
[19:42] that I would pray for them. So I bring
[19:43] it before us that we pray for good
[19:45] meetings that they would have that. And
[19:47] uh what made camp so special is that the
[19:49] expectations of the children and our
[19:51] expectations were so strong that that
[19:53] God moved, right? And we dedicated that
[19:56] time. And for the the counselors that
[19:57] went and everybody else that went, it
[19:59] was just a a glorious thing. And there's
[20:00] no reason that God can't move here if we
[20:02] have the same expectation. And so I
[20:05] don't want to go through the motions
[20:06] tonight. No. Okay. So I want to pray for
[20:09] these prayer requests. I thank uh Lord
[20:10] Jesus. Thank you Lord for the grace that
[20:12] you've given to your people. I thank you
[20:13] Lord for the the how real you have
[20:15] manifested yourself in our lives. I
[20:17] thank you Lord for a living God and not
[20:19] some religion or some cold formal
[20:21] experience. I thank you Lord for what
[20:23] you've brought me from. I look forward
[20:24] to what you're bringing me to. But I
[20:26] thank God for what you've done so far.
[20:28] And I thank you Lord for my brothers and
[20:29] sisters. As I was an only child and
[20:31] people teased me about being an only
[20:33] child and how I was selfish when I was
[20:35] younger. I thank God for a family around
[20:36] the earth of believers that uh that we
[20:39] that I can serve and and serve you in
[20:42] conjunction with them. I thank you Lord
[20:43] for these prayer requests. I thank God
[20:45] that we have a place we can bring prayer
[20:46] requests. I thank God that I see
[20:48] testimonies as a result of pray prayer
[20:50] and faith according to your perfect
[20:52] will. I thank you for your word. I thank
[20:53] you for the the ministry. I thank you
[20:55] for the the evangelistic gift. Brother

[21:00] the earth there's a bride of believers
[21:02] that can bring forth Lord and manifest
[21:05] your spirit upon the earth for a dying
[21:07] and bleeding world. I thank you Lord for
[21:09] your peace most of all in our hearts
[21:10] with you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.

[32:28] down in the stillness. I can hear my
[32:34] Savior calling
[32:38] out. Come to me and lay your burdens
[32:43] down.
[32:46] So I will lay down my
[32:50] struggles and I will lay down my
[32:54] shame and all the fear I drag around
[32:58] through this life like a ball chain. And
[33:04] I will sing
[33:07] halleluah to the one who sets me free.
[33:16] And you will find me at the feet of
[33:21] [Music]
[33:24] Jesus. And you will find me at the feet
[33:29] of
[33:31] [Music]
[33:33] Jesus. In the arms of Jesus, I will find
[33:39] my peace and rest.
[33:43] I hear him calling, "Come to me and
[33:47] [Music]
[33:51] rest." Buried by my shelter, cradled
[33:56] tightly to its
[34:00] chest. There and there alone I my soul
[34:04] finds rest.
[34:08] I will rest in the
[34:11] shelter of my
[34:14] Savior's
[34:16] embrace and safely in the
[34:20] reuge of his mercy and his grace. And I
[34:25] will sing
[34:28] hallelu to the one who sets me
[34:36] free. And you will find me in the arms
[34:41] of Jesus.
[34:46] [Music]
[35:17] At the feet of my
[35:21] savior, at the feet of my
[35:25] king, I will bow down and worship.
[35:30] I will lift my voice and sing
[35:35] hallelu
[35:37] hallelu to the one who set me
[35:45] free. You will find me at the feet of
[35:50] [Music]
[35:53] Jesus. And you will find me at the feet
[35:58] of Jesus.
[36:06] [Applause]
[36:25] [Music]
[36:30] There's a
[36:31] lot in the
[36:35] window. Table spread in
[36:39] splendor. Someone standing by an open
[36:45] door. Oh, I can't see a crystal river.
[36:51] Oh, I must be there forever. Cuz I never
[36:57] been this
[36:59] home

[37:10] time. I can see my father
[37:14] standing at the door.

[37:58] deliverance. So Lord, I've never been
[38:01] this home sick
[38:06] before. I can see the family
[38:11] gather. Sweet faces look
[38:15] familiar, but no one's own. Nobody's
[38:19] feeble
[38:23] anymore. My lonesome heart is crying. I
[38:28] feel like spreading my wings for flying
[38:32] cuz I never been this
[38:35] home before.
[38:39] See the bright light
[38:42] shine. Oh, it's just about home
[38:46] time. Oh, I can see my father standing.
[38:52] Oh, at the

[39:03] Lord, I've never been this
[39:07] homesick
[39:10] before. Well, this world is just a
[39:14] wilderness. And I'm ready for
[39:18] deliverance. Lord, I'm never in this
[39:22] home sick before.
[39:27] This world is just a
[39:29] wilderness and I'm ready for
[39:34] deliverance. Lord, I'm never been this
[39:38] home sick

[39:45] shine. Oh, it's just about home
[39:50] time. Oh, I can't see. My father

[40:17] wilderness. And I'm so ready for
[40:22] deliverance. Lord, I've never been this
[40:25] home city
[40:33] [Applause]
[40:41] before. He just leaves.
[40:49] Give D. Yeah. Help me sing
[40:52] this. The spirit and the bride are
[40:56] singing
[40:57] [Applause]
[41:00] come. The elect to be stirred inside
[41:05] their
[41:07] heart. Our united time has come. We are
[41:12] the
[41:14] father
[41:17] one. She will be with
[41:21] our
[41:25] forever.
[41:27] Oh light has come. The bride is making
[41:33] preparation. She's
[41:35] hearing the shout of her king.
[41:39] [Applause]
[41:46] He's leaving
[41:49] from the
[41:52] dirt once
[41:55] [Applause]
[41:58] [Music]
[41:59] again is granted to her.
[42:05] She's been washed in the blood of God's
[42:09] own
[42:11] son with a
[42:13] righteousness that's not our
[42:16] own. She's just before his
[42:21] throne. Where she'll reign with her Lord
[42:26] forever
[42:31] more light has come. The ground is awake
[42:36] in
[42:37] preparation. We're still here in the
[42:41] shadow of our
[42:46] [Music]
[42:49] king. He's cleaning from
[42:53] inside. And the
[42:57] dark
[43:01] on. And the
[43:05] dark on
[43:09] again.
[43:12] Amen.
[43:15] Hallelujah.
[43:17] Hallelujah. I'm so glad that we can be
[43:21] led. Man, what an echo. Somebody help me
[43:24] out up there. I'm telling you right now,
[43:28] if I pass this life into the other life
[43:30] and someone hands me a microphone, I did
[43:32] not make it.
[43:39] Is this better?
[43:46] Well, praise the Lord.
[43:49] Can you hear me now?
[43:52] Praise God.
[43:53] [Applause]
[43:57] Amen. I don't know why it is, but the
[44:00] Lord knows all things. It's kind of an
[44:02] honor to be with you. And certainly
[44:04] appreciate you praying for us over the
[44:06] weekend. We was down at San Carlos among
[44:08] the uh Patchy Indians down there and
[44:10] just had a wonderful, wonderful time in
[44:11] the Lord. And if you got nobody to pray
[44:13] for, remember those folks down there. It
[44:15] just really break your heart to see the
[44:17] conditions they live in. and just I just
[44:20] really enjoyed being among them and
[44:22] praying for their needs and just had
[44:24] really had an outpouring of the spirit
[44:26] of the Lord on Sunday morning. He really
[44:27] had a breakthrough for the people and it
[44:29] was just so wonderful to see that. And
[44:31] so and then tomorrow we'll be leaving
[44:34] for Indiana. Got two services there
[44:35] Thursday and Friday and then down to
[44:37] brother David's the weekend there for
[44:39] Easter and Manchester. So we desire your
[44:40] prayers as we travel. We count it an
[44:42] honor to be here tonight with you,
[44:44] knowing he's the same yesterday, today,
[44:46] and forever. And knowing that the dove
[44:48] still leads the lamb. Aren't you
[44:49] thankful for that tonight? Amen. And
[44:51] where would we be without this time of
[44:53] year when we turn our attention to the
[44:55] price that he paid for us at Calvary?
[44:57] And where would any of us be without the
[44:59] blood? I'm so grateful. Aren't you You
[45:02] remember You remember that time he come
[45:04] to you? I'll never forget it. December
[45:06] the 21st on a Sunday afternoon, 1981.
[45:11] The Lord camped him in an old building.
[45:15] I knew it was him because I felt him
[45:16] when I was a boy.
[45:19] I'm so glad what Calvary has done for
[45:22] us. Amen. If you have your Bibles and
[45:25] turn to the book of Mark, we're going to
[45:26] read from Mark chapter 14 starting at
[45:28] verse 36.
[45:31] and remember brother Donnie and sister
[45:33] Carol them as they're in uh over in
[45:35] Switzerland and brother David and sister
[45:37] Sus and some of them down in New Zealand
[45:39] and traveling and just remember them.
[45:41] I'm sure they appreciate your prayers.
[45:44] Mark chapter 14 we want to start reading
[45:46] at verse
[45:49] 36. Certainly enjoyed this long service
[45:52] is really really good.
[45:55] The Bible says
[45:57] this. And he said, "Aba, Father, all
[46:00] things are possible unto
[46:03] thee." Take away this cup from me.
[46:06] Nevertheless, not what I will, but what
[46:09] thou wilt. And he cometh and findeth
[46:12] them sleeping. And he saith unto Peter,
[46:14] Simon, sleepst thou? Couldest thou not
[46:19] watch one hour?
[46:22] Watch and pray, least ye enter into
[46:24] temptation. The spirit truly is ready,
[46:28] but the flesh is weak." And again he
[46:31] went away, and he prayed and spake the
[46:33] same words. And when he returned, he
[46:36] found them asleep
[46:38] again, for their eyes were heavy,
[46:40] neither which day what to answer him.
[46:44] And he cometh the third time, and said
[46:47] unto them, "Sleep on. Now take your
[46:50] rest. It is
[46:52] enough. The hour is come. Behold, the
[46:55] son of man is
[46:56] betrayed into the hands of
[47:01] sinners. Rise up, let us go. Lo, he that
[47:05] betrayeth me is at
[47:08] hand. You know, exactly on this day,
[47:11] 2,000 some years ago, Judas betrayed our
[47:16] Lord. Let us bow our heads. I want to
[47:20] speak to you this evening for just a few
[47:22] minutes on this is the
[47:25] hour, the season of
[47:30] recognition. Heavenly
[47:32] Father, Lord, as we come before you this
[47:35] evening, we're so grateful that you are
[47:38] a faithful high
[47:40] priest. And Lord, from the depths of our
[47:42] heart, we want to thank you for all that
[47:45] you have done for us, Lord.
[47:48] For while I was a yet
[47:49] sinner, you died for
[47:52] me. And Lord, as
[47:54] we got the request today of different
[47:57] ones, Lord, Brother Matt Carter and
[48:00] Sister Mallister, Lord, different ones
[48:02] that's afflicted, we ask, dear God, that
[48:04] your spirit would move upon them, that
[48:06] you'd be mindful, dear God, of the needs
[48:08] of your people, knowing, Lord, that
[48:10] you're the healer and the sustainer of
[48:12] our lives. And Father, we commit this
[48:15] service into your hands. We pray Lord
[48:17] that we could get oursel out of the way
[48:19] that you could speak to your children
[48:21] Lord that their faith could rise up and
[48:22] receive the things which you have
[48:24] promised us for this is the hour Lord
[48:28] and we pray dear God may we be faithful.
[48:31] We commit this congregation and oursel
[48:33] into your hands for your glory for we
[48:35] ask these things in Jesus name and the
[48:38] bride says amen. God bless you. You may
[48:40] be seated this
[48:42] evening. Amen. I'm gonna leave it on for
[48:47] this. You know, and our scripture opens
[48:49] this
[48:51] evening, we find our Lord praying in the
[48:56] garden. He had left Peter and the others
[48:59] a stone throw away. And he had went
[49:02] alone into the garden to
[49:04] pray. And he prayed earnestly if there
[49:06] should be a way that this cup would pass
[49:09] from him.
[49:11] He prayed, "Father, all things are
[49:14] possible with you.
[49:16] You You could do
[49:17] anything. Your God, don't make me drink
[49:21] this cup." Yeah. And the scripture says
[49:24] in Hebrews that who in the days of his
[49:27] flesh, when he had offered up prayers
[49:28] and supplications with strong crying and
[49:30] tears unto him that was able to save him
[49:32] from death, and was heard in that he
[49:37] feared. And being in agony, he prayed
[49:39] more earnestly and his sweat as it were
[49:42] great drops of blood falling down to the
[49:46] ground. You see, there is a medical
[49:49] condition known as
[49:51] hematradosis. And hemoddosis is a rare
[49:54] medical condition where sweat contains
[49:56] the blood, the capillaries that feeds
[49:59] the sweat glands. They rupture and they
[50:01] seep into the sweat. And it can be
[50:04] triggered by extreme physical and
[50:06] emotional anguish.
[50:10] And he gets up and he comes back and he
[50:12] finds Peter and him sleeping. And he
[50:13] says, "Peter, Peter, wake
[50:16] up. Could you not watch with me what
[50:21] hour?" And Peter says, "What's the
[50:24] matter, master? What's the matter?
[50:26] You're you're shaken.
[50:29] Is that blood on your
[50:30] face or are you
[50:33] bleeding? I've seen you walk on the
[50:35] water. I've seen you feed the
[50:37] multitudes. I've seen you raise the
[50:38] dead. But I've never seen you like this.
[50:42] Oh my.
[50:44] And he says, "Peter, watch with
[50:47] me. Help me pray." Amen.
[50:53] Lord, what shall I pray?
[50:58] And he comes back a third time. And the
[51:00] Bible said he cometh the third time. And
[51:02] he said unto them, "Sleep
[51:04] on and take your rest. It is enough. The
[51:08] hour is
[51:10] come. Behold, the Son of Man is betrayed
[51:13] into the hands of
[51:16] sinners. Rise up and let us go. Lo, he
[51:20] hath betrayed me. He who hath betrayed
[51:22] me is at hand. The hour is enough. that
[51:26] the hour denotes a certain definite time
[51:30] or season. And Jesus was here speaking.
[51:33] He said, "Father, the time has
[51:36] come." Now, there's seasons for
[51:39] everything. The prophet said, "Do you
[51:40] believe that you sow in a certain season
[51:43] and you reap in a certain season?" And
[51:45] there are seasons when the time comes
[51:47] right for things to happen. And he said,
[51:49] ' Do you believe that certain seasons
[51:52] brings responses?
[51:55] In summer, we find watermelons and
[51:57] picnics for the season of
[52:01] summer. We find hot chocolate and hot
[52:04] soup. In winter, because it's the season
[52:07] for it. And with each season carries an
[52:11] anointing. Let me say that again. Each
[52:14] season carries an anointing. Amen. And
[52:17] there are the things that God has
[52:19] promised for this age that he would
[52:21] happen. There's things God said it would
[52:23] happen in the age that we're living in
[52:24] and they will happen. And there's people
[52:26] on the earth now whose very purpose for
[52:30] being here is to fulfill these promises.
[52:36] He said, "For this cause was I born."
[52:38] And I want you to know that we were born
[52:40] for a purpose. We was not born just to
[52:43] be church members. We was not born to be
[52:45] just identified as a cult. Come on.
[52:47] That's not what we was put here for. But
[52:49] we was put here for a specific purpose.
[52:51] And he could have put us in any age he
[52:53] wanted to put us in. Luther's day west.
[52:55] He could have even put us in the days
[52:57] when walked on the shores of the Galilee
[52:58] with him. But he chose to place us in
[53:00] this hour.
[53:03] And he never put us here to fail. He
[53:05] never put us here to give up. He never
[53:07] put us here to backslide. But he put us
[53:09] here to be an overcomer.
[53:12] He put us here to put every devil under
[53:14] our feet. Amen.
[53:18] You were born for a purpose. Don't never
[53:20] let the devil lie to you and tell you
[53:22] you're a nobody. You are a somebody in
[53:24] the eyes of God.
[53:27] The season for these things to happen is
[53:29] here. The hour is come. And Jesus
[53:32] praying to the father. He acknowledges
[53:34] this that he's aware that this is his
[53:37] time.
[53:39] All the preparation, the first two pools
[53:41] of his ministry, all the fishes and the
[53:43] loaves and the miracles to get those
[53:45] people's attention to a vindicate who he
[53:48] was had come down to this. And he says
[53:52] the hour is come. It denotes a season,
[53:56] the season of recognition. Jesus coming
[53:59] down to the end of his ministry and the
[54:01] very purpose for him being on the earth.
[54:04] The hour is come.
[54:08] Amen. Amen. The purpose had come for the
[54:11] words of the prophets that they would be
[54:14] fulfilled. And now we find Jesus in
[54:17] Pilate's hall, in his judgment hall,
[54:19] betrayed by Judas, sold out for 30
[54:23] pieces of silver.
[54:25] Today, they sell him out for a book that
[54:27] you can buy on Amazon. Oh my or some
[54:30] kind of website to get followers.
[54:33] brother.
[54:36] And Pilate therefore said unto him, Art
[54:39] thou a king
[54:40] then? And Jesus answered and said, Thou
[54:43] sayest, I am a king. To this end was I
[54:46] born, and for this cause came I into the
[54:49] world, that I shall bear witness unto
[54:52] the truth, and everyone that is of
[54:54] truth, everyone that is of truth heareth
[54:58] my voice. Amen. That ought to make you
[55:01] happy.
[55:03] The hour has come. The season, the words
[55:05] of the prophet spoke has come into
[55:08] manifestation. And in Pilot's judgment
[55:10] hall, they said, "Pilate, this man
[55:13] claims to be the son of God,
[55:16] trying to provoke him into pronouncing
[55:18] judgment upon him." And when Pilate
[55:20] therefore heard this, saying, he was
[55:23] more afraid, and he went again to the
[55:25] judgment, and he saith unto Jesus, "When
[55:28] art thou?" Yes. Jesus gave him no
[55:33] answer.
[55:34] Sometimes it's good just to hold your
[55:36] peace. Amen. And then said Pilate unto
[55:40] him, "Speak thou not unto me? Knowest
[55:43] thou not that I have power to crucify
[55:45] thee, and I have power to release thee,
[55:48] but what my father will allow you to
[55:50] do?"
[55:53] Said, "Therefore, he that delivered me
[55:55] unto thee hath the greater sin. The hour
[55:57] had come for the prophecy, for the
[55:59] fulfillment of the prophecies. God's
[56:00] word would not return unto him void, but
[56:02] it will accomplish what it was sent to
[56:04] do. No one could stop it. Amen.
[56:07] Hallelujah. It could not be stopped. And
[56:09] let me say, this bride that was
[56:11] predestinated of God, she cannot be
[56:14] stopped.
[56:16] She will accomplish what she was sent to
[56:18] do. Nobody can stop it. There's not a
[56:20] devil in hell that can stop it. We may
[56:23] have trials. We may have trouble. We may
[56:25] have afflictions. We may have sickness.
[56:26] We may deal with all kinds of things.
[56:28] But it will not stop this bride.
[56:33] Amen.
[56:35] No one can stop it. Jesus recognized
[56:38] this hour. The hour is come. The hour
[56:42] has come for these things to be
[56:45] fulfilled. It is the season of the
[56:48] completion of my part of my earthly
[56:51] ministry.
[56:53] Time came for Noah to go in the ark. And
[56:56] Noah could not go into the ark before
[56:58] God was ready for him to go. You see,
[57:01] God would not be a just God to send
[57:02] someone to judgment that was just. And
[57:06] Noah was the preparation before the
[57:09] judgment. He was the preparation before
[57:12] the judgment. And what did they do? They
[57:14] rejected him. And they rejected his
[57:17] message. Amen.
[57:20] If you would have been in Noah's day,
[57:22] would you have got in the boat? Come on
[57:25] now.
[57:27] Amen. You see, take for a minute that we
[57:29] are Noah's day right here. And of all
[57:32] the people in this building,
[57:35] only
[57:35] eight went in the boat.
[57:40] Think about that for a minute. All the
[57:42] people in this, if we were that
[57:44] generation right here, represented in
[57:46] this building, only eight of us out of
[57:48] this building would have got in the
[57:54] boat. You see, in order to get into the
[57:56] boat, you would have to believe that Mo
[57:59] that Noah was a prophet
[58:01] against all those that said he was
[58:03] false.
[58:05] You had to believe that his message was
[58:07] from God.
[58:09] You would have to go against all the
[58:11] internet and the signs for that day
[58:13] saying there's no way it's going to
[58:14] rain. There's nothing up there. He's
[58:16] nothing but a liar.
[58:19] You would have had to go against all of
[58:20] that to get into the boat. But I tell
[58:24] you tonight, if you could see your day,
[58:26] you would have seen his day. Hallelujah.
[58:30] If you can recognize what God has done
[58:31] in this hour, then you would have
[58:33] recognized what God was doing in that
[58:34] hour.
[58:36] Amen. Hallelujah. And when the season
[58:39] came for Noah to go into the ark, God
[58:41] shut the door behind Noah.
[58:44] And all the opportunities for anyone
[58:47] else to ever enter was gone because the
[58:51] door
[58:52] had been shut.
[58:54] The hour had come.
[58:58] Noah's message was the preparation for
[59:00] the escape. And can you imagine, just
[59:03] think a moment, God was preparing Noah's
[59:06] preaching. And at the first thing you
[59:07] know, 120 years, but the first thing you
[59:10] know, why one day there come a thunder
[59:13] and I can see a flash of lightning for
[59:15] the first time flash across the side the
[59:18] sky. The season of fulfillment had come.
[59:20] The hour had come for Noah to go into
[59:23] the ark and he began to fill the pool.
[59:28] He said, "Come on, honey. Let's go." And
[59:32] his boys said to their wives, "Come on."
[59:34] And they got into the ark and the people
[59:37] said, "I wonder what happened. I wonder
[59:40] if there's a blast went off somewhere."
[59:41] And somebody might have said, "Oh, that
[59:43] was a rocket."
[59:49] The blast went off and a cloud began to
[59:52] rise. What was it? It was a sign that
[59:55] the hour had come, that the fulfillment
[59:58] of the prophet's message, Noah's
[1:00:00] message, was a preparation for escape.
[1:00:02] And when the blast of the thunder and
[1:00:04] the rising of a supernatural cloud was
[1:00:06] the evidence that the message was right,
[1:00:10] that was a blast
[1:00:12] followed by a cloud.
[1:00:21] You got that, did you?
[1:00:24] The cloud was a sign that behold the
[1:00:27] rain cometh.
[1:00:30] The cloud was a sign that behold the
[1:00:32] rain that Noah had preached about 120
[1:00:35] year was coming.
[1:00:38] Elijah said neither rain nor due do I
[1:00:41] call for it. Three and a half years went
[1:00:43] by a drought was in the land and up on a
[1:00:46] mountain where God had provided a place
[1:00:48] for him to go. He prayed six times and
[1:00:52] nothing happened. And he said Gahesa the
[1:00:54] seventh time. And Gahesa come back and
[1:00:56] said, "I see a cloud the size of a man's
[1:00:58] hand. Right now, a hot, dry
[1:01:02] climate that hadn't rained for three and
[1:01:04] a half years and the cloud the size of a
[1:01:06] man's
[1:01:07] hand, it would have evaporated almost
[1:01:11] immediately. So, we understand then that
[1:01:13] this cloud was a supernatural
[1:01:17] cloud.
[1:01:20] But the cloud testified of an abundance
[1:01:24] of rain that was covered. Amen.
[1:01:28] Hallelujah. Oh, God. Let me see if I
[1:01:31] could just bring it to you the way I saw
[1:01:32] it when I was looking at it. Think about
[1:01:35] it, friends. The cloud was a vindication
[1:01:37] that the rain was coming.
[1:01:41] The cloud was a recognition that it was
[1:01:43] coming. Amen.
[1:01:49] Amen. Do you love him?
[1:01:55] Amen.
[1:01:58] Blessed be the name of the
[1:02:01] Lord. It not rained for three and a half
[1:02:03] years, but then the rain cometh.
[1:02:08] I got excited. Let me get over here
[1:02:10] again. Amen.
[1:02:16] Brother Brandham talked about the girl
[1:02:18] out
[1:02:20] west and he told the story how that the
[1:02:23] son of man, the the son of the man who
[1:02:25] owned the company had came out to the
[1:02:28] ranch looking for a
[1:02:30] bride and all the girls had dogled
[1:02:33] yourself up thinking that he would
[1:02:35] choose them because of their looks or
[1:02:36] because of their clothes or because of
[1:02:38] their jewelry. But he wasn't interested
[1:02:40] in that. He wasn't looking for a pretty
[1:02:43] face. He was looking for character.
[1:02:47] And he saw where the rest of them was
[1:02:49] lazy in the Leodysia age. She was
[1:02:52] laboring. Yeah. Taking out the dishwater
[1:02:55] and throwing it over the fence. And he
[1:02:57] watched her. And he went to her and he
[1:03:00] said, "I see something in you that I
[1:03:02] want. I see a character and I want you
[1:03:04] to be my wife. Will you marry me?"
[1:03:08] She said, "Sir, I feel so
[1:03:11] unworthy, but yes, I'll marry you." He
[1:03:15] said, "Now, I promise you, I'll come
[1:03:17] back at a certain time. You be ready.
[1:03:20] Come on. I'll come back a year from now.
[1:03:22] At this day, you be ready to go at a
[1:03:25] certain time, and I'll take you with
[1:03:27] me."
[1:03:30] And so, she saved her money. The prophet
[1:03:32] said, 75 cents a week. saving her money
[1:03:36] to get a wedding garment for the bride
[1:03:38] hath made herself ready. Amen.
[1:03:42] And as the season approached, she went
[1:03:45] into a little
[1:03:47] room. And there in that little room, she
[1:03:50] dressed herself for the wedding. Nobody
[1:03:53] helped her. The bride hath made herself
[1:03:56] ready. Amen. Amen.
[1:04:00] As the season approached, she put on the
[1:04:02] garment and the first thing you know
[1:04:04] when she came out and they they saw her
[1:04:06] that she was identifying herself as a
[1:04:08] bride.
[1:04:09] They begin to laugh at her and they
[1:04:11] begin to make fun of her and they begin
[1:04:13] to ridicule her. Yes, sir. Oh, you're
[1:04:16] just following a cult. You've lost your
[1:04:17] mind. You're you're in some kind of
[1:04:19] you're you're just a delusion. But not
[1:04:21] to her. She had a revelation. Amen.
[1:04:25] Amen. And the first thing you know, they
[1:04:27] all got around her and started dancing,
[1:04:30] you know, and singing songs, making fun
[1:04:32] of her.
[1:04:34] Yeah. And they met out like they was a
[1:04:36] bride pretending to be a bride. But it
[1:04:38] did not bother her. Come on now. Because
[1:04:42] you see, her eyes wasn't on the critics.
[1:04:46] Her eyes was on the promise.
[1:04:49] Hallelujah. I'm not interested in what
[1:04:51] they say in Facebook. I don't serve this
[1:04:53] message because, come on, somebody. I
[1:04:55] don't serve this message because of
[1:04:57] something that I see. I serve because
[1:04:58] the word vindicates it to be the truth.
[1:05:03] And if somebody talked you into it,
[1:05:04] somebody could talk you out of it. But I
[1:05:06] was not talked into it. I was born for
[1:05:09] this
[1:05:15] purpose. Her eyes was on the promise.
[1:05:18] And she watched that little old clock
[1:05:20] ticking. The first thing you know is
[1:05:22] just about a minute before he was due to
[1:05:24] come. Somebody said, "I thought you said
[1:05:26] he was coming."
[1:05:28] He's coming. That's right. I thought
[1:05:31] he's supposed to be here at a certain
[1:05:33] certain time.
[1:05:34] Don't worry, he'll be here.
[1:05:38] That's all I have to know. All I have to
[1:05:41] know is the brother said he's coming.
[1:05:42] That's all I have to know.
[1:05:46] Amen. He promised he'd be here. That's
[1:05:48] all I want to know. He's coming. When? I
[1:05:50] don't know. But he will be here. The
[1:05:53] hour has come for the return. The season
[1:05:55] is right. The promise is true. And right
[1:05:58] where they were making fun of her and
[1:06:00] saying all these things about her and
[1:06:02] teasing her and making fun of her and
[1:06:03] everything, they heard the
[1:06:05] wheels of the coming horses in the sand
[1:06:08] underneath the bookboard. And she broke
[1:06:10] through the line of the critics and out
[1:06:11] into the yard she went. What was it? She
[1:06:14] was ready. She was dressed. The hour has
[1:06:16] come. The season is here of recognition.
[1:06:19] This is my wedding
[1:06:23] day. The carriage was ready. The groom
[1:06:25] was ready. He grabbed her in his arms
[1:06:27] and set her up on the buckboard and they
[1:06:29] turned the carriage away. Headed off to
[1:06:31] Chicago. I'll come for you. He said he
[1:06:34] promised her. When you see these things
[1:06:37] happening, get ready. The hour is come.
[1:06:42] The pool is at hand.
[1:06:45] Amen.
[1:06:47] Amen. John said in
[1:06:50] 16:21, "A woman when she's in travail
[1:06:53] have sorrow because her hour is come,
[1:06:56] but as soon as she's delivered of the
[1:06:58] child, she rememberth no more the
[1:07:00] anguish, but for joy that a man is born
[1:07:03] into the world." You see, a woman knows
[1:07:05] when it's her hour, not the neighbor's
[1:07:08] time, not someone else's time, but when
[1:07:11] that birth pain strikes, she knows. She
[1:07:14] recognizes that her hour is come. It is
[1:07:17] a season of recognition.
[1:07:21] I remember when Sarah was pregnant with
[1:07:23] Jessica and it was on a Saturday morning
[1:07:26] and I was going down in the back field
[1:07:27] to cut some trees and she came out on
[1:07:30] the back
[1:07:31] porch. She said, "Darl," I said, "Yes,
[1:07:34] honey." She said, "I need to go to the
[1:07:36] hospital. It's
[1:07:38] time." And I said, "Are you sure?"
[1:07:43] I said, ' Maybe we should call Ask a
[1:07:45] nurse and see what they
[1:07:48] say. And my lovely wife, just as calm,
[1:07:51] said, "But I'm a
[1:07:57] nurse." I said, "Oh,
[1:08:02] yeah. Oh,
[1:08:04] yeah. That's right."
[1:08:07] Amen. Amen. The recognition of her hour
[1:08:11] had come. The season of fulfillment had
[1:08:14] come.
[1:08:15] Jessica was being born.
[1:08:19] Saints, the hour has come. And I say to
[1:08:22] you, are we ready? Are you ready? Are
[1:08:26] you feeling the birth pain? Do you feel
[1:08:27] the pull? We've compassed this mountain
[1:08:31] long enough. It's time we turn
[1:08:32] northward.
[1:08:35] It's time we become what the word says
[1:08:38] we are. It's time we take our
[1:08:39] inheritance and exercise our God-given
[1:08:42] right and take the sword. Hallelujah.
[1:08:44] And drive it to the heart of our enemy
[1:08:46] because we are victorious.
[1:08:49] It's time for signs and wonders to
[1:08:50] follow the believer. According to the
[1:08:52] word. Come on. Not somebody's emotion,
[1:08:54] not somebody's sensation, but the signs
[1:08:57] and wonders according to the word.
[1:09:03] Amen. Amen. The hour come. The prophet
[1:09:07] said that's what the church is doing
[1:09:08] today. For Jesus is the word. He is the
[1:09:10] bridegroom and the bride is a part of
[1:09:12] the groom. Therefore, the word that is
[1:09:14] to be fulfilled in this day is the same
[1:09:16] part of the word that was fulfilled in
[1:09:18] his day. And it's the same word, same
[1:09:21] experience, same life. Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:09:26] Amen. Yes, sir. Same word, same
[1:09:29] experience, same life. The word that's
[1:09:32] fulfilled in his day, the word of the
[1:09:34] groom. In other words, the same word
[1:09:36] that speaks for the groom speaks also
[1:09:38] for the bride. Same life, same
[1:09:40] experience,
[1:09:41] same word. Amen.
[1:09:45] Hallelujah.
[1:09:47] Amen. Do you see that, friends? You see
[1:09:50] the church, Israel is in her homeland.
[1:09:54] She's there. Elijah's done come and
[1:09:56] gone. There's a rapture of the church.
[1:09:59] Hallelujah. He promised us a rapture.
[1:10:02] And that rapture is for a people that is
[1:10:04] bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh,
[1:10:06] word of his word, life of his life. In
[1:10:08] other words, he's coming for himself.
[1:10:11] [Music]
[1:10:12] She will be him expressed the works that
[1:10:15] he done. She will do also.
[1:10:19] Remember what we heard last Wednesday
[1:10:21] night? What a powerful message it was.
[1:10:24] When the brother Donnie from this
[1:10:26] pullpit, he preached, "Who are you?"
[1:10:29] Amen. Who are you? It's the season of
[1:10:33] recognition. The hour has come.
[1:10:37] Wonderful.
[1:10:39] Brother Donnie wasn't trying to tell us
[1:10:41] who Luther was, who Wesley was, who the
[1:10:43] restoration of the Gibbs was. But he's
[1:10:45] trying to tell you who you are. Look
[1:10:47] into the word and see who you are. Amen.
[1:10:54] What happened on Sunset Peak, on Sunset
[1:10:57] Mountain?
[1:10:59] You can't make that stuff up. It came
[1:11:01] down on Sunset Peak on Sunset Mountain.
[1:11:06] A blast followed by a cloud of seven
[1:11:09] angels vindicated that the message is
[1:11:12] right. And soon
[1:11:14] cometh the real rain.
[1:11:18] A blast in Noah's day. A supernatural
[1:11:20] cloud was the vindication, the season of
[1:11:23] recognition that the rain was coming. A
[1:11:25] supernatural cloud in Elijah when it
[1:11:27] happened rain for three and a half years
[1:11:29] was the evidence that the rain was
[1:11:30] coming and a
[1:11:33] blast. Hallelujah. And seven angels
[1:11:36] produced a supernatural cloud is
[1:11:38] speaking to us that the real rain is
[1:11:42] coming.
[1:11:44] Thank you, Lord. You see now why I've
[1:11:47] been so zealous of the kind of seed that
[1:11:49] I've planted for the body. The rain's
[1:11:51] going to fall pretty soon. I mean the
[1:11:53] real
[1:11:54] rain and it's got to have seed to fall
[1:11:57] on. He said I hope I live to see it. Do
[1:11:59] you understand now? We'll be living. We
[1:12:01] will it will be living the it will be
[1:12:02] the living word as it was at the
[1:12:04] beginning. The spoken word of God have
[1:12:07] his power for it is him. It is him in
[1:12:10] his own body.
[1:12:16] Who is the bride? Who are you? You are
[1:12:19] his body represented on the earth.
[1:12:26] What was in the cloud? His head. What
[1:12:29] good's a head without a body? What
[1:12:31] good's a body without a head? Amen.
[1:12:35] Oh God. But the head comes to call the
[1:12:38] body to enjoy to make them one as the
[1:12:41] sun and moon is one. Amen.
[1:12:45] Amen.
[1:12:47] Hallelujah.
[1:12:49] spoken word of God to have his power for
[1:12:51] it is him in his own body working his
[1:12:54] own way. Look to the promises that God
[1:12:56] gave this body. The promises that God
[1:12:59] gave this body. We are not a people
[1:13:03] without a promise. We are not a people
[1:13:04] without an inheritance. We are not a
[1:13:06] people without power. We are not a
[1:13:08] people without anointing. We are not a
[1:13:10] people without a message. We are not a
[1:13:12] people without a word. Amen. For we are
[1:13:15] the word
[1:13:17] for our day vindicated. The body, his
[1:13:20] body on the earth,
[1:13:23] not an organization, not a denomination,
[1:13:26] but a body hast thou prepared me? A body
[1:13:29] hast thou prepared for me? Amen. Who is
[1:13:33] that
[1:13:34] body? It's you.
[1:13:38] The season of recognition, the hour has
[1:13:42] come. the promises that God gave this
[1:13:44] body. You see, if I taught you a method,
[1:13:47] a method Methodist
[1:13:50] message, it would take no effect on you
[1:13:53] because this ain't Methodist time. This
[1:13:56] is bride time.
[1:14:00] A Methodist message would do nothing to
[1:14:02] you.
[1:14:04] This is bride time. If Moses taught the
[1:14:06] message of Noah, it would have took no
[1:14:07] effect. If Jesus taught Moses message,
[1:14:10] it would take no effect. Yeah. because
[1:14:12] the predestinated seed or land that will
[1:14:15] only be watered by that type of water
[1:14:19] that's given for that seed. So there is
[1:14:21] a water that is given for this seed. A
[1:14:24] certain kind of water
[1:14:29] a real rain to bring a real water to
[1:14:32] water a real seed to bring forth a crop.
[1:14:36] A many membered body represented on the
[1:14:39] earth universal
[1:14:41] making him the same yesterday, today,
[1:14:43] and forever.
[1:14:45] Amen.
[1:14:46] I told the Apaches over the weekend, I
[1:14:48] said, "We don't have to go back to 65
[1:14:50] and see what God done." He's doing it
[1:14:52] now.
[1:14:53] He's healing now. He's raising the dead
[1:14:56] now. Come on, somebody.
[1:14:58] We've not lost our strength. We've not
[1:15:00] lost our We've not got down here and run
[1:15:02] out of gas. This is our finest hour.
[1:15:05] [Applause]
[1:15:10] Amen. It will only be watered by that
[1:15:12] type of water that's given for that
[1:15:13] seed. See, it won't grow in any other
[1:15:17] condition. It must be the condition that
[1:15:20] grows it. And when you see the church
[1:15:22] getting worldly like it was in the days
[1:15:24] of Sodom, when you see the church world
[1:15:26] all going into the worship of the God of
[1:15:29] this evil age and seeing that then
[1:15:31] seeing then seeing a little little
[1:15:33] minority group gathered out under the
[1:15:36] inspiration of God producing again the
[1:15:41] life of Jesus Christ by the scriptures
[1:15:45] that's supposed to happen.
[1:15:49] reproducing the life of Jesus Christ
[1:15:51] again by the scriptures. In other words,
[1:15:54] the word spoken for your day, somebody
[1:15:57] takes that word into their heart. When a
[1:15:58] son of God by faith takes the word of
[1:16:00] God into his heart and speaks it back
[1:16:02] upon his lips, it's just the same as
[1:16:04] deity speaking. Every mountain has to
[1:16:07] move.
[1:16:08] Jesus spoke the word for his day. Wesley
[1:16:11] spoke the word for his day. But this is
[1:16:12] our day and we have a message. We have a
[1:16:14] word.
[1:16:16] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. You know the
[1:16:20] hour that you're living in. The Bible
[1:16:22] fortell by prophecy what day you're
[1:16:24] living in and what time we're living in
[1:16:25] and what kind of events ought to be
[1:16:26] taking place. It foretells it exactly to
[1:16:28] the letter and it's never missed one age
[1:16:31] all the time. No one time had it ever
[1:16:34] missed and it
[1:16:35] won't. For who are the predestinated
[1:16:38] seed will see it. Jesus said, "No man
[1:16:41] cometh to me except my father draws him
[1:16:44] first, and all that my father hath given
[1:16:46] me will come." It's the word joining
[1:16:49] with the word. It can do nothing else.
[1:16:52] It's the day that we're living in when
[1:16:55] the word is coming to the word.
[1:16:59] It's the day that we're living in. The
[1:17:02] hour has come. The season of
[1:17:05] recognition. The season of recognizing
[1:17:08] who you are. Like the little boy that
[1:17:09] looked into the mirror for the first
[1:17:10] time, he didn't realize what he's
[1:17:12] looking at. But the longer he looked and
[1:17:13] he waved and he waved and all that he
[1:17:15] went through and all he got closer and
[1:17:16] closer and finally he touched the glass
[1:17:18] and he realized it's me. I'm looking at
[1:17:21] myself. Hallelujah. And when you look
[1:17:24] into the promised word for this hour, if
[1:17:26] you keep looking into the word, you know
[1:17:27] what you'll see? You'll see yourself.
[1:17:35] The same time the bride has recognized
[1:17:36] the evening light. It's just beginning
[1:17:38] to recognize the hungry Pentecostals
[1:17:42] begin to recognize that them
[1:17:43] organizations has got hasn't got
[1:17:45] anything that they're looking for.
[1:17:46] They're so twisted up, so torn up. See,
[1:17:48] it's the time of recognition. You've got
[1:17:51] to recognize the world has recognized,
[1:17:53] the nations has recognized, science has
[1:17:56] recognized, the devil has recognized
[1:17:58] that it's time he can wreck havoc on the
[1:18:01] women, wreck the church, wreck the
[1:18:02] people. He's recognized it. And God has
[1:18:06] recognized that there's a people on the
[1:18:08] earth that he has predestinated to life.
[1:18:12] He recognized this is the time to send
[1:18:15] his message. He's did it. The people has
[1:18:18] recognized it. And the bride time has
[1:18:20] realized the evening light. You see, the
[1:18:23] word manifested for the hour that you're
[1:18:25] living in is the light of that hour.
[1:18:28] Yeah. The word manifested for the hour
[1:18:31] that you're living in is the light for
[1:18:33] that hour. The evening light is just not
[1:18:35] the name of a church.
[1:18:39] The evening light is you.
[1:18:46] God.
[1:18:47] Jesus said, "I'm the light of the
[1:18:49] world." And then he said, "You're the
[1:18:51] light of the world." Did he suffer
[1:18:52] amnesia? Forget what he said? No. He's
[1:18:54] trying to tell you something. I'm the
[1:18:56] light of the world. But he said, "You're
[1:18:58] the light of the world." Why? Because
[1:18:59] I'll be with you, even in
[1:19:01] you. Amen. Amen.
[1:19:05] Amen. Not just a church name. Not just a
[1:19:08] church name, but it's you. Colossians
[1:19:12] 1:26 says this, "Even the mystery which
[1:19:14] had been hidden from ages and from
[1:19:17] generations, but now is made manifest to
[1:19:20] his
[1:19:22] saints been manifest." In other words,
[1:19:24] it has been made known. In other words,
[1:19:26] it has been revealed. The same word
[1:19:28] revelation and manifestation is the same
[1:19:30] word means the same
[1:19:33] thing. Amen. Amen. The even the mystery
[1:19:37] which has been hidden from ages and ages
[1:19:39] from generations but now but now but now
[1:19:43] is made manifest to his saints but now
[1:19:46] is made manifest to his saints denotes a
[1:19:48] set time or a set season like that song
[1:19:51] amazing grace. I once was lost, but now
[1:19:56] I'm found.
[1:20:00] Colossians 1:27. To whom God would make
[1:20:02] known the riches, the
[1:20:06] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:20:09] among the
[1:20:10] Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the
[1:20:15] hope of glory. Amen.
[1:20:18] You see the action, the action of the
[1:20:21] mystery unfolding produces a reaction to
[1:20:24] the people it's unfolding to. Amen.
[1:20:29] Amen.
[1:20:32] The action of the mystery
[1:20:35] unfolding is causing a reaction to those
[1:20:39] it's unfolding to. My word will not
[1:20:42] return and be void. It will accomplish
[1:20:44] what it was sent to do. Amen. Paul's
[1:20:47] telling us here that the book of
[1:20:48] Colossians that God had this great
[1:20:50] mystery hidden from ages and from
[1:20:53] generations until a set season or a time
[1:20:56] that he would make this mystery
[1:20:59] known. And I say to you tonight,
[1:21:02] friends, this is the time when the time
[1:21:06] comes to make known this hidden mystery,
[1:21:08] when it come time to make it known, how
[1:21:10] would he make it known? How would he do
[1:21:12] it? this mystery that was in his mind.
[1:21:15] How would he make it
[1:21:17] known? Paul tells us in Ephesians 3:3,
[1:21:20] how that by
[1:21:21] revelation he made known unto me the
[1:21:24] mystery as I for wrote in few words he
[1:21:28] made it known to me by revelation. What
[1:21:31] is faith? Faith is a revelation.
[1:21:34] Amen.
[1:21:38] How that by revelation he made it known
[1:21:40] unto me the mystery. He makes the
[1:21:43] mystery known by revelation, by
[1:21:45] manifestation.
[1:21:47] Yeah.
[1:21:49] Amen. Brother said, "Now God's secret
[1:21:52] mystery that he had before the world
[1:21:54] began that was in the back part of God's
[1:21:56] mind. The mystery laid in the back of
[1:22:00] God's
[1:22:01] mind." And there was something that he
[1:22:03] was trying to do. There was something
[1:22:05] that he was going to achieve. And he had
[1:22:07] a motive in doing it in order to let
[1:22:10] himself be expressed. This mystery that
[1:22:14] was in his mind was how he was going to
[1:22:17] make himself expressed.
[1:22:23] It laid in the back part of his mind
[1:22:25] something that he was trying to do is
[1:22:27] do. He was going to achieve. He had a
[1:22:28] motive in doing it in order to let
[1:22:31] himself be expressed. God had the secret
[1:22:35] in his mind. Nobody knew nothing about
[1:22:37] it. For who had the access to God's
[1:22:41] mind?
[1:22:44] Notice he allowed Moses to go where?
[1:22:46] Just back to the beginning. That's far
[1:22:50] as Moses could go. Is that not what he
[1:22:53] wrote? In the beginning. That's as far
[1:22:57] back as he could go.
[1:22:59] But think of it. In this hour that we're
[1:23:01] living in, he allowed the prophet of
[1:23:03] Malachi 4:5 and 6 to go into the back
[1:23:06] part of God's mud.
[1:23:10] He allowed the prophet of this age to
[1:23:12] catch that secret and reveal it to his
[1:23:15] bride. Now, why would God suddenly want
[1:23:17] this secret to be known? A secret that
[1:23:19] had been kept down through the ages and
[1:23:21] to the generations. Why all of a sudden
[1:23:24] would the secret be made known after
[1:23:26] generation upon generation couldn't even
[1:23:29] look at it? Yes. Yeah. Why all of a
[1:23:32] sudden
[1:23:34] was it the season? Was it the hour of
[1:23:38] recognition of this mystery that was in
[1:23:40] his mind? Why would he do that? Because
[1:23:42] there must be somebody on the earth now
[1:23:46] who can receive it.
[1:23:50] a predestinated chosen body of people on
[1:23:54] the earth that knows what he wants done
[1:23:58] with his word.
[1:24:01] For shall have thus sayeth the Lord or
[1:24:03] keep still.
[1:24:08] Amen.
[1:24:11] Amen. Right? You see, not a God above
[1:24:13] us,
[1:24:16] not a God above us, not just a God with
[1:24:20] us, but his desire, the thing he wanted
[1:24:23] to achieve would be a God that was in
[1:24:26] us. Amen. Amen. The hope of all glory.
[1:24:30] What does the Bible say? Christ in you.
[1:24:33] Yes.
[1:24:35] Christ in me. The hope of all glory.
[1:24:41] Amen. 2 Corinthians 6:16. What agreement
[1:24:44] hath the temple of God with
[1:24:46] idols? For
[1:24:49] ye are the temple of the living God.
[1:24:54] Not a god of stone, not a god of wood,
[1:24:56] not a god of someone's imagination, but
[1:24:58] the living God having a living
[1:25:00] tabernacle that he could live in and
[1:25:02] express himself through.
[1:25:06] You're the temple of the living God. As
[1:25:08] God hath said, I will dwell in them and
[1:25:11] walk in
[1:25:13] them, and I will be their God, and they
[1:25:16] shall be my people.
[1:25:22] Notice God's desire was not just to be
[1:25:24] with his people, but he wanted to be in
[1:25:28] his people. For he said, I will dwell
[1:25:30] not with them. I will not dwell with
[1:25:33] them, but in them. Amen. and I will not
[1:25:37] walk with them, but I will walk in them.
[1:25:43] God walking in his people.
[1:25:53] Oh, God, we live so beneath our
[1:25:54] privilege. Yeah. We let the devil beat
[1:25:58] us down and tell us we're barely hanging
[1:25:59] on and we're barely going to make it.
[1:26:00] You need to tell him to sit down and
[1:26:02] hush. Amen. You need to remind him who
[1:26:05] you are. You need to remind him who your
[1:26:06] daddy is. Come on, friend. You need to
[1:26:08] remind him where you come from and where
[1:26:10] you're
[1:26:11] going. This is who we are. This is not
[1:26:14] who we're going to be. It's who we are
[1:26:15] now. Do you have the Holy Ghost? That's
[1:26:18] the life he lived when he surrendered it
[1:26:20] that day of Calvary and it went back to
[1:26:22] the father. But on the day of Pentecost,
[1:26:24] what did he do with that life? He sent
[1:26:26] it back through the church.
[1:26:32] Amen. God the creator walking in his
[1:26:37] creation. No wonder Enoch could go home
[1:26:40] with
[1:26:41] him. Enoch walked with God and he was
[1:26:44] not.
[1:26:47] Brothers,
[1:26:49] come listen to me as they
[1:26:52] come. You didn't stagger into this
[1:26:54] message.
[1:26:56] That's right. That's right.
[1:26:59] God predestinated you for this time.
[1:27:04] The hour has come. The season of
[1:27:07] recognition. The season. This hour. This
[1:27:09] time it is bride time.
[1:27:14] The manifested Christ in you. The hope
[1:27:16] of glory. That great manifested God in
[1:27:19] Christ. Was God not manifested greatly
[1:27:22] in Christ? Amen. Was he not greatly
[1:27:25] manifested in Christ? He healed the
[1:27:27] sick. He raised the dead. He walked on
[1:27:28] water. He fed 5,000 with five bis with
[1:27:31] biscuits and two fish. Was not he
[1:27:34] greatly manifested in Christ? The
[1:27:36] manifested Christ in you, the hope of
[1:27:38] glory. The great manifested God in
[1:27:41] Christ. Now Christ manifested in you.
[1:27:47] The great God that was manifested in
[1:27:49] Christ is now manifested in his blood.
[1:27:53] Look at what was once God's great
[1:27:55] secret. God's great mysterious secret
[1:27:58] that was in his mind. But the mystery
[1:28:01] has transitioned. The mystery that was
[1:28:04] once in his mind is no longer in God's
[1:28:07] mind.
[1:28:08] Where did it go? Where is it at? What
[1:28:11] was once God's great secret, God's great
[1:28:14] mysterious secret that was in his mind
[1:28:16] is now put in the hearts of the
[1:28:20] believers. Amen.
[1:28:25] The mystery that was in God's mind is
[1:28:29] now in your heart.
[1:28:34] Not going to be well someday, some happy
[1:28:36] day. No, today
[1:28:40] recognize your day and its message
[1:28:42] today.
[1:28:44] Put in the heart of the believer. That's
[1:28:45] his body. The body of Christ. What was
[1:28:47] once God's great secret in his mind
[1:28:49] before the foundation of the world is
[1:28:52] now made manifest is now made manifest.
[1:28:56] Is now revealed. Is now made known.
[1:28:58] Where is it made known? Not on a
[1:29:01] bookshelf.
[1:29:03] In his people.
[1:29:09] [Music]
[1:29:10] Hallelujah.
[1:29:14] Think of it. a great secret in his mind
[1:29:17] before the foundation of the world is
[1:29:18] now made manifest. The prophet said,
[1:29:20] "Think of it." He said, "Oh my, where
[1:29:24] where in his
[1:29:27] bride and God would manifest it." Think
[1:29:31] about this. That God would manifest it
[1:29:34] in one man. Now he's manifested it in
[1:29:37] the entire church universal.
[1:29:41] What God manifested in one man called
[1:29:43] Jesus, he has now manifested it in a
[1:29:46] universal bride. Amen. Amen. Everywhere
[1:29:51] God can work through every man and every
[1:29:54] woman that'll open up their heart.
[1:29:57] That's right. And let the Lord Jesus
[1:29:58] come in and work his will through them.
[1:30:03] Amen. I think sometimes why we fail so
[1:30:05] much is we still try to project our will
[1:30:08] instead of his will. That's right. You
[1:30:11] see, a creator, a creator is about
[1:30:13] expression.
[1:30:17] You take an artist and they set up their
[1:30:19] canvas. It's a blank piece of paper. You
[1:30:21] don't even know. You don't know what
[1:30:22] they're thinking. You don't know what
[1:30:24] they're going to draw. You don't know
[1:30:25] anything about it. You do not know
[1:30:27] what's in their mind. But once they take
[1:30:30] the paint and start painting on the
[1:30:32] canvas, the thought that they had in
[1:30:34] their mind, the image that they had in
[1:30:36] their mind begins to be manifested. What
[1:30:39] they were thinking, what they were
[1:30:40] feeling is all expressed on the canvas.
[1:30:43] And you see, God don't want my
[1:30:44] education. God don't want my ability. He
[1:30:47] just wants my canvas. Hallelujah. He
[1:30:50] just wants me to surrender my will. That
[1:30:52] he can express himself through me. Amen.
[1:30:55] That he can preach through us, heal
[1:30:56] through us, deliver through us, live
[1:30:58] through us, express himself through us.
[1:31:00] That the world may know he is the same.
[1:31:02] It was what God desired.
[1:31:05] Amen. The whole time. Amen.
[1:31:08] was to be in his people.
[1:31:15] Amen. In the days of the voice of the
[1:31:18] seventh angel, when he shall begin the
[1:31:21] sound, the mystery of God, the mystery
[1:31:25] of God should be finished as he has
[1:31:28] declared to his servants the prophets.
[1:31:32] Therefore, the entire Bible is a
[1:31:35] revelation of God's mystery in
[1:31:39] Christ. The Bible, the Bible, therefore,
[1:31:43] the entire Bible is the revelation of
[1:31:47] God's mystery in Christ.
[1:31:54] In
[1:31:55] Christ. In Christ.
[1:32:00] Don't that sound kind of
[1:32:03] familiar? You see, Mary was a human
[1:32:06] incubator and she carried that holy
[1:32:08] child and brought him to birth. It was
[1:32:09] he was a God man. He was the son of God.
[1:32:12] He was a new creation. Man and God met
[1:32:15] and joined. He was the first of a new
[1:32:18] race. He is the head of this new race.
[1:32:22] Well, if he's the head,
[1:32:25] where is the body?
[1:32:28] Right.
[1:32:33] Amen. Amen. She was a human incubator.
[1:32:37] She carried that holy child, brought him
[1:32:38] to birth. It was God. He was a God man.
[1:32:40] He was a son of God. He was a new
[1:32:41] creation. Man and God met and joined. He
[1:32:45] was neither man nor God. He was a God
[1:32:47] man. Man and God met and joined. He was
[1:32:50] the first of a new race. He's the head
[1:32:51] of that new race. And he is the head of
[1:32:53] the body. He is the head of the body. He
[1:32:56] is the head of the body which is the
[1:32:58] church which
[1:33:00] is us.
[1:33:04] Amen. Who is the beginning of the
[1:33:06] firstborn from the dead that in all
[1:33:08] things he might have preeminence.
[1:33:11] Therefore, if any man be in Christ, if
[1:33:13] any man be in Christ, because the entire
[1:33:16] book, the entire revelation of the Bible
[1:33:19] is in him. And if any man is in him,
[1:33:24] then the entire revelation of the Bible
[1:33:26] is in them.
[1:33:30] Oh God.
[1:33:35] Oh
[1:33:36] God. Help me to see it, Lord.
[1:33:41] Amen. If any man be in Christ, he is a
[1:33:44] new creation. All things have passed
[1:33:46] away. Behold, all things become new.
[1:33:49] Then you can see that though man that
[1:33:52] though man was of the old order or the
[1:33:55] old
[1:33:56] creation now in union with Christ he has
[1:34:00] become a new creation of God. A new
[1:34:04] creation not made after the order of the
[1:34:07] old creation. A new creation. God's
[1:34:10] mystery that he had in his mind. What he
[1:34:12] wanted to achieve was a new creation. A
[1:34:15] new race of people. Not known by their
[1:34:17] skin color, but known by what dwelt in
[1:34:20] them.
[1:34:22] [Applause]
[1:34:25] Amen. That's what I told the Apaches
[1:34:26] over the weekend. I said Jesus didn't
[1:34:28] die to make everybody white. He died to
[1:34:30] make us saved. He come to redeem us back
[1:34:33] to himself. Amen.
[1:34:38] Amen. Then you can see that though man
[1:34:40] was of the old order of the old
[1:34:41] creation, now in union with Christ, he
[1:34:44] has become a new creation of
[1:34:47] God. For we are the workmanship created
[1:34:50] in union with Christ.
[1:34:52] We are his workmanship created in union
[1:34:56] with Christ Jesus unto good works.
[1:35:00] Amen. Let's stand.
[1:35:04] Amen.
[1:35:15] a super race. Abraham said it was God in
[1:35:18] his
[1:35:19] creation, God and his son, and now God
[1:35:23] in his people.
[1:35:27] What are you hunting? Squirrel. How many
[1:35:30] you do need? Just speak the word. Amen.
[1:35:35] God in his people. Don't you see the
[1:35:40] entire Bible is the revelation of what
[1:35:42] God
[1:35:43] desired? When
[1:35:45] Moses, he was a type. Moses was a type
[1:35:48] when he stretched forth his hands and
[1:35:49] split the Red Sea. David was a type when
[1:35:52] as a teenager he took a stone and slayed
[1:35:54] a
[1:35:55] giant. Samson was a type when he took a
[1:35:58] jawbone and slayed a thousand. Yeah.
[1:36:01] Peter was a type when his shadow when he
[1:36:03] walked by people, his shadow healed
[1:36:05] them.
[1:36:07] God in his people, God showing I want a
[1:36:10] super race of people that they can speak
[1:36:13] a word. The prophet of God said you can
[1:36:15] speak a world and go live on it.
[1:36:18] God in his people, a new race.
[1:36:26] You see, all hell fights this truth.
[1:36:29] Amen. But it is the truth.
[1:36:35] Don't you see why the devil's fighting
[1:36:37] us? He don't want you to see who you
[1:36:39] are.
[1:36:43] Because with the true
[1:36:46] revelation of what she is, with the true
[1:36:49] revelation of what she is and who she
[1:36:51] is, and that she can do the greater
[1:36:52] works, she will be an invincible army
[1:36:55] and the gates of hell will not prevail
[1:36:57] against her.
[1:36:59] But she will, she will, she will prevail
[1:37:03] over them.
[1:37:07] Put on a new man which after God has
[1:37:10] created in righteousness and true
[1:37:12] holiness. Friends, the season has come.
[1:37:15] This is the hour of recognition that we
[1:37:18] need to begin to say what the word said
[1:37:20] about us. Amen.
[1:37:24] Amen. Yeah. When I was a little boy, I
[1:37:27] had no idea who I was. But my mama and
[1:37:29] my daddy kept calling me Daryl, Daryl,
[1:37:32] Daryl, Daryl, Daryl, Daryl. Until one
[1:37:35] day, I said,
[1:37:37] "What?" And I recognized I recognized
[1:37:41] they was talking to
[1:37:44] me. Don't you see,
[1:37:46] friends? God sent you a prophet to call
[1:37:50] your name, to call your age, to call
[1:37:52] your season, to call your time, to tell
[1:37:54] you
[1:37:55] I no longer call you church. I call you
[1:37:59] bride.
[1:38:02] And I say shalom.
[1:38:04] The sun is up. Amen. Hallelujah. He's
[1:38:07] resurrected. Where in his people? Do you
[1:38:10] see it, friends? I know we don't see it
[1:38:13] like we ought to, but if we keep looking
[1:38:14] at it, if we keep looking at it and
[1:38:16] looking at it, we'll be like that little
[1:38:18] boy. He said, "My mama, it's me."
[1:38:21] Amen. He's talking about me.
[1:38:26] The works I do shall you do also. Who
[1:38:30] was he talking about? He was talking
[1:38:32] about you. Amen.
[1:38:35] Amen. Do you love him?
[1:38:39] Let's bow our heads. I hope I ain't kept
[1:38:41] you too long. I
[1:38:43] just Oh Lord
[1:38:48] Jesus. God, I pray
[1:38:51] Lord that in my feeble way that somehow
[1:38:53] I could bring this thought across, Lord,
[1:38:54] that you put up on my heart there in
[1:38:56] that hotel room in Arizona.
[1:38:59] Lord, I begin to look at these things,
[1:39:01] oh
[1:39:04] God. Lord, how it's stirred my heart.
[1:39:09] Lord, if we could just see these things
[1:39:11] that your prophet has told us, Lord, if
[1:39:14] we could take them into our heart and
[1:39:15] speak them back up on our lips, they
[1:39:17] will manifest. Your word will manifest.
[1:39:20] It will not return unto you void, but it
[1:39:21] will accomplish what you have sent it to
[1:39:23] do. And this message is coming this hour
[1:39:25] to call a people, a new race, a new
[1:39:28] creation to whom you're not ashamed to
[1:39:31] call them brethren. Amen. Oh God, help
[1:39:34] us lay aside every weight to never sin.
[1:39:36] Lord, we can see why Satan wants to keep
[1:39:38] us so busy, wants to keep us so focused
[1:39:40] on so many different things that we
[1:39:42] can't look at these things. But God, may
[1:39:45] we realize we become the word as we
[1:39:46] receive the word. Amen. Oh God, may we
[1:39:49] take it into our hearts, Lord. May we
[1:39:51] speak it back upon our lips. And may
[1:39:53] every mountain of doubt and every
[1:39:55] mountain of fear move, Lord, for we're
[1:39:57] living in the hour, dear God, when these
[1:40:00] things are manifested among your people.
[1:40:01] The dead are being raised, the sick are
[1:40:04] being healed, demons are being cast out,
[1:40:06] Lord, in this very hour, Lord. In this
[1:40:09] very hour when the critics are so
[1:40:12] against us, even as they were you, Lord,
[1:40:14] in those final hours, they turned
[1:40:16] against you to the point they crucified
[1:40:18] you. But what come next, Lord, was a
[1:40:21] resurrection, oh God. And we see the
[1:40:23] hour that we're living in. We see this
[1:40:24] moment in time, oh God. May we not
[1:40:27] slack. May we not, Lord. Oh, God. May we
[1:40:31] not coast, Lord. But may we press to the
[1:40:33] mark of the high calling that's in
[1:40:35] Christ Jesus. Grant it tonight, Lord. I
[1:40:38] pray. Grant it tonight, Lord. We ask
[1:40:42] these things in Jesus name. Oh friends,
[1:40:46] do you love him tonight? Can you see it
[1:40:47] tonight? Just say, "Lord, open my eyes,
[1:40:50] Lord. Open the eyes of my heart. I want
[1:40:52] to see it, Lord. Lord, I see it, but I
[1:40:54] want to see it more. I want to draw
[1:40:56] closer to you, Lord. I want to
[1:40:57] understand it more. I want to yield
[1:40:58] more. I want to just be that canvas, oh
[1:41:00] God, that you can express yourself
[1:41:02] through. That my wife can see you. That
[1:41:05] my children can see you. That my husband
[1:41:06] can see you. Those at work can see you.
[1:41:08] Those around me can see you, Lord, that
[1:41:11] they won't see me. That my life is so
[1:41:13] surrendered through your will that you
[1:41:15] can manifest yourself through me.
[1:41:18] Grant it, oh Lord, I pray tonight. Grant
[1:41:21] it, Lord Jesus. Oh, do you love your
[1:41:24] friends? Can we just lift our hands to
[1:41:26] him tonight?
[1:41:28] Amen.
[1:41:30] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord
[1:41:32] Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Oh God, I
[1:41:36] see it, Lord, but I want to see it more.
[1:41:38] I understand it, Lord, but I won't
[1:41:40] understand it more. Open the eyes of my
[1:41:42] heart, dear God. Open the eyes of my
[1:41:44] heart, Lord. I want to see you, God.
[1:41:48] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I need more of
[1:41:51] you, Lord. I need more of you in my
[1:41:53] life. More revelation, more
[1:41:54] understanding, more surrender, Lord.
[1:41:56] More of you, less of me. Granted, oh
[1:41:59] God, tonight I pray in Jesus name. Lord
[1:42:02] Jesus, the hour has come. The season of
[1:42:05] recognition. It's a set time, Lord. Noah
[1:42:08] couldn't enter the ark until it was
[1:42:09] time. But when it was time, nobody could
[1:42:11] keep him out, Lord. The hour is upon us,
[1:42:14] dear God. It is time. Oh, Father, let us
[1:42:17] surrender to you. Grant it, Lord Jesus.
[1:42:21] Grant it, Lord Jesus.
[1:42:24] Hallelujah.
[1:42:27] More

[1:45:09] Lord, more mercy, more grace, more love,
[1:45:12] more understanding, more revelation,
[1:45:14] more
[1:45:15] power, more surrendered life. I need
[1:45:18] more of you, Lord. Till there's no room
[1:45:21] left in me.
[1:45:24] I want to sit at your feet. I want to
[1:45:27] drink from the cup that's in your hand.
[1:45:29] I want to lay my head against your

[1:45:43] week? As our mind is on the crucifixion
[1:45:47] and the resurrection of our Lord, don't
[1:45:49] you see how much he loved you? If he
[1:45:51] loved you enough to save you, then he
[1:45:53] loves you enough to heal you. He loves
[1:45:54] you enough to keep you. He loves you
[1:45:56] enough to forgive you. He loves you
[1:45:57] enough to restore you. Amen. He loves
[1:46:00] you enough to live in you.
[1:46:02] He loves
[1:46:03] you. There is no He loves me not on this
[1:46:06] daisy. He He loves me. He loves me. He
[1:46:10] loves me. Aren't you glad tonight? Are
[1:46:14] you grateful tonight? Thank you.
[1:46:16] Do you see your hour? Do you recognize
[1:46:19] your season? Do you see who you are in
[1:46:21] the word? You say, "Oh, brother Dad, I
[1:46:23] want to see it more." I do, too,
[1:46:25] friends. But oh, God, we can ask the one
[1:46:27] who's able to make it real to our lives
[1:46:30] tonight. Blessed be the name of the

[1:51:35] Lord, I've been running a long time,
[1:51:42] Lord. I'm not as young as I used to
[1:51:46] be. It takes longer to
[1:51:50] recover. Can't think of it as fast as I
[1:51:52] used
[1:51:54] to. Can't deliver it as fast as I used
[1:51:58] to. Oh
[1:52:01] Lord, whatever I am tonight,
[1:52:04] Lord, I give it to you, Lord
[1:52:07] Jesus. I give myself to you,
[1:52:11] Lord, that you could express yourself
[1:52:14] through me. That your desire, that great
[1:52:16] mystery that you've placed in my heart
[1:52:18] could be expressed, Lord, through this
[1:52:21] life, dear God. And I pray tonight,
[1:52:23] Lord, for my brothers and my sisters
[1:52:25] here, Lord.
[1:52:27] I pray dear God that it could somehow
[1:52:29] Lord understand what it was I was trying

[1:52:35] inability way Lord Jesus I I see Lord it

[1:52:41] way Lord that they could understand
[1:52:42] Father it be more clear be more
[1:52:45] plainer of the hour that we're living in

[1:52:52] daughters of God we always were sons and
[1:52:55] daughters daughters of God, it is the
[1:52:57] hour of our
[1:52:59] manifestation. And Lord, tonight,

[1:53:04] prayer, we bring our brothers and
[1:53:06] sisters that's afflicted, Lord, those

[1:53:18] hospital, Lord, may you move for our
[1:53:20] brother tonight, oh God.
[1:53:24] and that sister Mallister, Lord, down
[1:53:26] there in Mississippi, Lord, that reached
[1:53:29] out to us that had a terrible fall.

[1:53:34] come back into its place, dear God, and
[1:53:36] may there be no little effects, Lord
[1:53:38] Jesus. Our brothers and our sisters that
[1:53:41] are battling this demon of cancer, oh
[1:53:43] God, may our faith rise to drive that
[1:53:46] thing from their bodies, Lord, that they
[1:53:48] could be free. For whom the Son hath
[1:53:50] made free is free indeed. Thank you,
[1:53:52] Lord. Others, Lord, suffering with
[1:53:54] oppression and depression, Lord, in the
[1:53:57] the the the the
[1:53:58] the stress of this hour, I pray, oh God,
[1:54:01] may they find that peace that surpasses
[1:54:03] all understanding, Lord God. And may
[1:54:06] they rest, dear God, not in their
[1:54:08] ability, but in your ability to keep us
[1:54:10] in this hour, Lord. Father, be with our
[1:54:13] brothers who are traveling this week,
[1:54:14] Lord. Our young people down at the youth
[1:54:16] camp and all the youth that's gathered
[1:54:17] there. God, may you move in a great way.
[1:54:19] And Lord, may every one of them receive
[1:54:21] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Lord,
[1:54:24] Father, your little bride gathering
[1:54:26] around the world this Easter Sunday, may
[1:54:28] we come with that
[1:54:29] resurrection. What an Easter that was.
[1:54:31] But what an Easter this is, Lord. That
[1:54:34] the resurrected Christ now living in the
[1:54:36] hearts of his people, manifesting
[1:54:38] himself through our lives that the world
[1:54:40] would know you're the same yesterday,
[1:54:42] today, and
[1:54:43] forever. God, go with your children
[1:54:45] tonight. Lord, I pray. Father, thank you
[1:54:48] for the opportunity to speak before your
[1:54:50] people as we commit these things into
[1:54:52] your hands for your glory in Jesus name.
[1:54:56] God bless you saints. Do you love him
[1:54:58] tonight?
[1:55:00] Isn't it good to be a Christian? Ain't
[1:55:02] it good that we can look at these things
[1:55:04] and rejoice in these things and know
[1:55:06] that this is not some man's ideal, but
[1:55:08] it's absolutely thus saith the Lord.
[1:55:12] Oh, what a blessed people we are
[1:55:13] tonight. Amen. You may not have $10 in
[1:55:16] your pocket, but you're the one of the
[1:55:17] richest people in East Tennessee because
[1:55:20] these mysteries have been made known to
[1:55:21] you. And you see your day and you see
[1:55:23] your hour and you see yourself and you
[1:55:26] know who you are and you know where you
[1:55:27] come from and you know where you're
[1:55:29] going and you know who your daddy is.
[1:55:30] Amen.
[1:55:33] Hallelujah.
[1:55:35] Hallelujah. You know, I love genealogy.
[1:55:37] I sometimes after I preach, I go to a
[1:55:39] hotel room. I just look at it, try to
[1:55:41] unwind a little bit.
[1:55:43] You know, you you do your DNA, you get
[1:55:45] 50% of your DNA comes from your mama. I
[1:55:47] know you know that. And 50% of it comes
[1:55:48] from your daddy. And that's why some
[1:55:50] people say you look just like your mom.
[1:55:51] And people say, "No, you look just like
[1:55:52] your daddy." Because you got their
[1:55:54] genetics in you. So you're part of your
[1:55:56] mama and you're part of your daddy
[1:55:58] naturally. But I was reading what the
[1:56:00] prophet of God said that we drink from
[1:56:02] the breast of El Shadi. So he said God
[1:56:04] is our mother.
[1:56:06] And then I read what the prophet of God
[1:56:07] said we was born by the breath of God.
[1:56:09] He said God is our father. Oh my. So my
[1:56:12] spiritual DNA, I get 50% from my
[1:56:14] mother and 50% from my daddy. Then that
[1:56:18] makes my spiritual genetics, my
[1:56:19] spiritual DNA, as brother Tracy say,
[1:56:22] it's just God, honey. It's just
[1:56:26] God. Aren't you glad tonight? Aren't you
[1:56:29] glad tonight? Sing it, brother Harry.
[1:56:31] Spirit of the bride say come. Spirit of
[1:56:33] the bride say come. Let's sing it as
[1:56:34] we're dismissed. Amen. Just remember the

[1:56:39] the Lord's just going to move forward a
[1:56:40] very remember us as we travel and sure
[1:56:42] love and appreciate you. Thank you for
[1:56:44] listening to me. I trust him if
[1:56:45] something said that help you.

[1:59:52] He's clearing from
[1:59:55] [Applause]
[2:00:07] inside. God bless you. You just miss the
[2:00:10] fear of the Lord tonight. Just go
[2:00:12] believe it and remind the
[2:00:15] devil. When he tries to remind him of
[2:00:18] your past, you just remind him of his
[2:00:20] future.
[2:00:22] Amen. He's a defeated enemy. He's a
[2:00:24] defeated being. He is under your feet.
[2:00:27] Amen. Amen. Do you believe that tonight?
[2:00:31] Amen. Amen. It's the truth. We are the
[2:00:34] overcomer in this hour. Oh, blessed be
