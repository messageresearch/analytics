the Lord tonight we've have so many needs among our our church local church body of course all those that were in contact with in different states and different parts of the world and the needs are so many but our God is mindful of each and every one of them heavenly father as we approach you tonight through the channel of prayer how thankful we are to be able to community Comm unicate with the Eternal himself if I had to have $1,000 each time I had to pray I wouldn't be able to pray much most of these people here if they had to have a royal title some sort of dignity some sort of degree or state recognition or public recognition would never be able to talk to you much but all we need is Faith and if anyone will come to you you must believe that you are and believe that you are a rewarder of them that diligently seek you we're so grateful for that opportunity father as it's done been mentioned several of the requests tonight before you and Lord we realize that sickness disease is so prevalent in the age that we live sadness sorrow heartaches one thing after another after another but we believe there's still victory in spite of everything that we face in life and we thank you Lord for that victory that you have brought to us so once again we're bring them before you and all the hands that were uplifted signified one or many needs and You Are God Alone you're the one that can go to every one of these needs and requests and able to minister to them according to your will now father as it once again follows my lot to try to stand and speak about your word I pray that you'd help me tonight father to be able to get out of the way shut my mouth to anything that would displease you may I say that which is beneficial and helpful to the body correction if we need it uplifting if we need it holy ghost healing whatever we need tonight father I just open myself to You Make Me a Channel simply a conduit through which your power your words can flow granted tonight father we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus and the saint said amen amen I'm he happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight I want to say how happy we are to have brother and sister Cuts with us tonight brother Amos and sister Lisa I looked back there and saw his smiling face Sister Lisa is your so short I didn't even see you God bless you we're so glad to have you all with us tonight that's that's quite a drive for them up in Virginia to come down here on Wednesday night but thank you all so much we y all always have a special place in our hearts weren't we tremendously blessed by this past weekend praise the Lord brother Nathan I thought just did a did an outstanding job someone told me that there was a a a meeting that was held recently it was a message meeting and um there was some different younger preachers that was there and preached and the man that was hosting the meeting supposed to be an elder in the message got up and said how refreshing it was to him to hear preachers preach without quotes I thought that was about one of the dumbest things I ever heard in my life really if we're going to gather around a denomination let's forget the identification of the message of the hour if we're going to believe it let's preach it praise the Lord I told carot we went home I said I'm reminded her of that statement that that Minister had said and I said it done my heart good to hear a young preacher stand there and preaching the message laying the message right out I thought praise the Lord let your servant die in peace I'll tell you friends if you only could hear some of the trash and nonsense that I hear that preachers that's supposed to believe this message are preaching it make you realize why I say the things I just said this message is not a treasure to everyone who says they believe it it's no more to some than just a dictionary or you know something else they just kind of pick up and look at when they want to well I'll tell you one thing when God revealed this message to me years ago I didn't get it as a dictionary I got it as a word a message sent from God Amen it changed my life I believe it's changed yours not only that it's still changing us amen God bless you well I didn't eat gunpowder for supper and I didn't eat Locust and wild honey for breakfast so rest easy everybody rest easy Jeremiah chap 5: 24 praise the Lord Jeremiah chapter 5 verse 24 neither shall they say in their heart let us now fear the lord Our God that give us reain both the former and the latter in his season he reserve unto us the appointed weeks of the Harvest now remember in the Old Testament it was a natural in the New Testament of course it's a type to us spiritually Hosea 6:3 then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain I want you to notice now not his doctrines not his theology but he will come to us as the rain as the latter and the former rain unto the Earth you see those who have a real understanding of the Moray the teaching of the word they realize the teaching of the word is Christ in word format so that's why they hold on to it with everything they are they don't look at it as just a fleeting passing something and they're waiting for something greater the greater is what quickens this he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and the former reain unto the Earth Joel 2 verse 23 be glad then ye children of Zion I remember naturally Zion of the Old Testament Zion in the New Testament is the bride be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God how many believes that need to do a little bit of more rejoicing around here rejoice in the Lord your God notice he don't say rejoice in your back aches rejoice in inflation Rejoice because it's an election year Rejoice because of this and that but rejoice in the Lord sometimes it's hard to Rejoice if your back's killing you it's hard to Rejoice if you got a headache but if you can rejoice in the Lord you can Rejoice no matter what you're dealing with that's right now notice why we can rejoice in the Lord your God for he has given you the former Reign moderately moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain now notice what happens when the latter rain falls when the former rain falls it falls moderately but when the latter rain falls you get two parts you actually get former and latter together but it only falls on those who've got the moay first notice what Joel said he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain together this is what it's going to be now this is the way the prophet took it and plac this scripture and said that they would both fall together for he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month may the Lord bless his words you may be seated how many believes are living in the end time amen I believe that with all of my heart we believe that of course for many many years and you know it it's amazing whenever we talk about the end time now as most of you know I come from a Pentecostal background so hearing the latter rain was something that I heard quite frequently it was actually something that I preached as a Pentecostal preacher now I believed in those days that I was experiencing the latter rain but what I didn't realize was that I was preaching and believing I was experiencing the latter rain but I didn't know I didn't even have the former rain yet because what I had was the teaching rain from ausa stre I did not have the Moray of Malachi 4 now I do not believe that I had a word birth under my Pentecostal experience I shouted I jumped I run I hollered I glorified God I preached I cast out Devils I laid hands on the sick I I saw crosseyed straightened out I saw phenomenal miracles in my Pentecostal Ministry but I was still preaching under a hybridized word so what did it predu use out of my life well I received hybrid seed I sowed hybrid seed so what did I produce out of the product of my Ministry now I know a lot of preachers can't stand up and say this because they don't know how to Humble thems I have no problem in saying it I preached false Doctrine I preached error I preached erroneous things I just didn't know it was false at the time I was preaching the very best that I had but once God showed me I was wrong I was big enough to look back and say you know what I preach wrong I preached things that was not the truth anybody say Amen to that tonight I wonder how many of y'all believed wrong before rest of you ain't nothing but balac Liars well if you've been saved very long at all you have believed wrong stuff because God don't save none of us and give us full Revelation the first day of our new birth God gives it to us by progression he gave it to the prophets by progression he actually gave it to Brother brandham by progression as well I understand a lot of message folks have a problem with that when you go to preaching it but that's their problem it ain't mine because I can Su prove this by what brother Rand said himself but I look back and I realized that had God not stopped me where I was I would have been going down the line of Benny hen Kenneth copelan and all of those men by now a man in my late 60s I would have been you know a rod Parsley all of those type of guys because those were men that were around the same time I was and they were being sown in their hearts by their forefathers and their predecessors a hybrid Pentecostal seed and it is now produced their crop all they're waiting for is the World Council of churches now remember the latter rain will fall on the bride and produce a Rapture the latter rain will fall on The ecumenical move and produce a World Council of churches that will bring them all under the headship of Rome it will fall on the those that are gathered together under the offices of Billy Graham and it will lead them on to embrace Sodom so this is why you find them knocking on the Methodist door and the methodists are letting them in you find them knocking on the Episcopalian doors and they're letting them in letting them become pastors letting them become Elders in the church is that right sure the Methodist Church held off for a long time but finally the mainstream body of it just a few months ago decided to go ahead and do it yeah there's actually Methodist people oldtime Methodist people that are pulling away from the Methodist church thank God they may have be one of those that'll be have life and come up in the tribulation period you know why they can't stand to see their Church going down into Sodom but we're not in Sodom in the first place now watch this seed that was sown under three main Planters a Billy Graham an O Roberts and an Elijah now I come up under that part which was an oril Roberts seed l so or Roberts then had an emphasis on Miracles Supernatural signs wonders but as far as theology having a doctrine of restoration to point to people back to the word he didn't have it he was not a restorer a man with a lot of Miracles I have nothing evil to say about the man but he had a lot of Miracles a lot of signs a lot of Wonders a lot of things that actually happened in his ministry but what did it lead to o r you Oral Roberts University well we don't have a brandom university we don't have a brandom university that's right because God's Prophet never left us a college he left us a new birth he never left us a college or a bunch of schools but he left us tape so where we could come back to the original word by the baptism of the Holy Ghost now think of where many of you would be tonight if it were not for the grace of God that had caught somewhere maybe maybe your grandfathers maybe your fathers your parents or somebody that actually caught the seed that was sown under the ministry of Elijah maybe you got it by a book or a tape or someone told you about it and there was a reciprocating part of that word which God showed in you when you were born now you wouldn't actually looking for it you might not have even known it was even out there but God allowed it to cross your path and when it did it was like something from that grabbed a hold of something in you and it was something you didn't want something you wasn't asking for something you wasn't even looking for and the two pieces come together as the Chinese did when they tore the tag of your laundry then whenever the tag Pieces come together it meant your laundry of your old sins was totally annihilated and you stand before God as if you never done it am now this is where of course the world is coming to the culmination of where we are now and this is why that we would have it would probably be frightening to us tonight to know how many politicians in Washington and also in Nashville and our you know our mayor departments and sheriffs and whatever more that are socialists and Communists and everything else and we would have never thought it but whenever we go back into the message the prophet told us that it was being seed down then in 1962 with seeds of Communism and then they wind up and we've got one that's even W to run to be vice president with communistic ties so they say our president existing now has communistic ties and this Senator and that Congressman well why don't they kick them out they're afraid to you know why they've got to remain there their seed was swn so our White House is riddle with it our mayor's offices all types of legal positions are ridd with or brother Donnie let's all get together and root them out we can't root them out but neither can they root us out why because it must come to the Harvest cycle we will never come back oh I know that people are prophesying and along the charismatics and them and you know they're out there prophesying America's going to have a Revival and you know this is going to take place and that's going to take place I'll tell you what it is is it's false prophecy there is no scripture America has turned down her chance at a Revival they may have an intellectual Gathering but they will never have a Gods sent Holy Ghost Revival now when the bride goes people will no doubt get all stirred and get scared and get terrified and they will go to altars and they will cry and they will M they will be so emotional and some of them will shout and dance and jerk and so on and really think they're getting something and they don't even realize the blood is no longer even on The Mercy Seat now that's going to be really sad is it not and yet what will it do now whenever we look at where we are now remember how that in the last days that whenever the prophet first looked at Pentecost and he identified actually now think about it that a prophet of God with a light he was walking in in the time he actually looked at that shove and he looked at it and called Pentecost the seed so he looked there and he saw that it was the seed now in the 1950s brother brandham actually said and believed I know you're going to get quiet and that's all right I'm used to quiet whenever I come over things like this but I believe we got some Believers in your night you'll be able to say Amen that the prophet himself believed and actually preached in the 50s that the latter rain was falling right then now he believed the lighter rain was following falling then in 1950 what's this expectation these signs shall follow them that believe he promised it and then he promised the former Reign and the latter Reign and we're living now have been for years under the latter rain so here this is 1950 so brother Brandon believe the lighter rain was falling oh my I figured y'all get quite and big eyed on me but notice now no friend don't don't let this CH you don't let it bother you let our Prophet grow in Grace the way we did why does this bother people I I just don't understand it I can follow a man like that that can say God showed him more I can't follow the William Brandon that a lot of these people have made they have a false prophet they're they're they're worshiping a man they're making an Idol out of him come on somebody watch now he says and we're living now have been for years under the latter rain again why I'm a holy rotor 1953 God in this last days is sending the latter rain now that's right power of the Holy Ghost coming back as sure as he sends the Wind and Rain there's a tree standing there to Rejoice again paragraph 66 God's pouring out the latter rain upon us now look look here he is in the midst of this revival so isusa Street which happened of course many years prior to this and there was a dying down now what did God do then God sent the angel to meet his prophet in 1946 and tell him that there's going to be another stiring so he looks at it and from where he's looking at it that God is sending this great move and from that one commission that was Revival fires all across the world is that right you familiar with that statement so then at the time he looks at it that that what happened after the commission of 1946 was actually the light of rain so notice what years that we're reading so 1950 1953 notice again now 1956 the time has come for the signs to follow the Believers where at the end time we're in in the latter rain so watch here he is mid-50s looking at the Revival that's going on friends it's going wide open I know we've seen great things in the message oh my for many years but we have seen nothing in comparison to what was going on in the 50s and the 60s I'm talking about tens of thousands of people and it wasn't one man here and one man there it was all all over the world that it was happening people being healed oh my of distorted members in their body blinded eyes come open and it was not just brother brandom's Ministry it was or Roberts it was Tommy Hicks it was TL Osburn it was one after another after another it was a global move and here stands brother randam looking at what's going on and he sees the rain falling the spirit of God is coming and a great thing was happening and he thinks it's the light of rain sir it's the light of rain but the teaching rain hadn't went forth yet so what was it it was rain now listen it was rain boy didn't you all enjoy the last couple of days of rain we got man wasn't that awesome well see I can see you didn't enjoy it near as much as I do cuz I've been coming over here about every day or every other day and watering all these hundreds of shrubs and watering this grass and watering this and coming over five six seven times a day and moving a sprinkler and setting it over here for two hours then come back and set it over there for two hours that's the way I do some saints sometimes I kind of get around them and sprinkle back back and forth and back and forth then I try to move over to this section of the church and then I try to move over to this section of the church oh when I saw that rain coming in I'd about have me a spell I was so happy oh I can tell some of y'all didn't even care if it rained or not if you had all the time invested into it that I did you'd be as smiling like a possum like I am tonight as well I was happy that it started raining I was happy when I woke up in the night and it was raining I was happy when I woke up in the morning and it was raining because it was a good sign our grass is going to live our trees are going to live well that's the way I feel about a good Holy Ghost shower when God sends Among Us my I feel like that's the way it was this weekend for us don't you it just started out and God started sending the rain in the first service and the next service is a little heavier then on Sunday morning he just gave us a total wash out I mean we was need deep we was having to just weigh down through the water it was so good and so fine amen I Rejoice I don't know about you I love the word I love the word but I love a little water on top of that word to make it Live come on somebody I don't just love going to church I love going to church to worship I love going to church to sing I love going to church to clap my hand I love going to church and let the devil know whose side I'm on I don't go to church to act like a bump on a pickle and never move and barely back my eyes God saved me many years ago and he called me to be a worshipper he called me Hallelujah to give praise to his name I give him all the praise I praise no other man I praise no woman I give no one my heart felt praised but almighty God I was born to praise him I was born to to clap my hand I was born to dance a little bit I was born to bless the name of the Lord I was born to worship him I can do it when it's dry let's everybody praise the Lord I feel sorry for the song leaders that get up in come on let's everybody get with it now y'all sit there just just dries On The Desert Sands and they're looking at you thinking I'm so glad I ain't singing But one more song so I can sit down and let brother Donnie have this service but oh when they sang like there was a while ago and the spirit begins to come down ain't that amazing how it feels sing the same songs but it's just so good you just want to sing another stanza you just want to sing another verse why the presence of God the water is coming so here the the world not not now just in Jeffersonville not now in America but the world God in his Mercy was giving showers and showers and the prophet looks out and he says it must be the latter of rain but watch him in 1960 we formed churches great Lutheran Church Methodist Baptist Presbyterian all those great churches has come up during this time but we've never had exactly a promise a latter rain as we're prophesied to have amen testing one two one two testing one two everybody okay sir now so what did he see he saw great Revival but something's begin to change transition time oh my notice the title of this sermon former and latter rain in the last days there would be lighter rain and the former and lighter rain would be together so it will come together former and latter rain now remember at this time if he knows the word Mor he doesn't say it and he doesn't say it till a couple years later and when he first mentions it spoken words Original Seed he makes it sound like he just found it just found the word now in the last days there would be latter rain and the former and latter rain would be together now the first rain was in the East and the latter rain is in the west and in the latter rain both former and latter will be together again the same sermon he promised that there would be a light of rain in the church the church spiritual in the last days he pour out both former and latter rain remember former rain come first latter rain come second both former and latter rain in the same season well I'll tell you one thing I hope I'm alive when this season fully arrives amen because it's going to be former and lighter together yeah now remember this is his thinking in the way that he's approaching this in 1960 watch 1961 the prophet said there'd be a former and a l of rain and the latter of rain would be both former and latter of rain together a great church Universal that would sweep from one side of the world to the other side of the world a great message ah a great message so tell me what message or Roberts left and he all ever read any of his books nobody T osbor Tommy Hicks any of those guys none of you wow an't that amazing their names are famous but for what did they ever preach a Hebrew series no or an adoption series what about a question answers on jusis so what are they known for healings signs wonders Miracles not a message come on somebody now Paul had healing signs wonders and miracles but thank God for not only that but Paul left us a message in the New Testament praise the Lord now watch as the prophet begin to see this and it's like God is pointing him in in a direction a great message great signs and wonders would be accomplished by this church now this is why friends I absolutely cannot believe former and latter rain in the last day is only going to be cold dead theology no it is not it is more than just a bunch of doctrines that we come together and say set in the message church and the preacher stands up there and reads and reads and reads God didn't call me to read the gospel he called me to preach it well come on somebody and God not only called me to preach the gospel but he called me to demonstrate the gospel in other words to make Jesus Christ live again among his people so the message within itself and we know for years that this is the cycle that the message went through and some are still there I hate to say it this way tonight but when you look around we have a hybridizing that has gone on in the message for many many years men and early on I to the prophet left each one of them well many of them anyway said this away many of them you know trying to get a position so I was with him and he called my name he laid hands on me you know this one come up with this idea and then another one that was there with him he come up with this idea what was each one of them wanting a following of people then they began to hybridize the message in the same way the Pentecostals did theirs so why do we have so much chaos in and around the message today it's because those seeds were swn years and years ago well Hallelujah but let me give you a great big glory to God tonight because there were also men of God in that same time frame that were not interested in getting a following they were not interested in building a kingdom they were interested in preaching the message of the hour according to the scripture and by them men doing that it paved a way for us to be here tonight oh blessed be the Lord thank God for many of our forefathers in the message don't you appreciate them I do many of them we didn't even know but but thank God for many of those that stood up for the truth and they was not interested in building something for themselves they realized they was a part of the biggest thing there was why would I be so stupid to want to build a Donnie Reagan Kingdom which would be about that big around why would I want to do such a crazy thing when I am part of the biggest thing that has ever been as long as I stay in my place I don't need a Donnie Reagan King we don't need a Tim TR Kingdom a Ron Spencer Kingdom a Daryl Ward kingdom come on somebody what we want to do is be identified in the Kingdom of Jesus Christ oh praise the Lord so in this former and lighter rain there will be a great message great signs and wonders would be accomplished by this church Daniel said the people that know their God in that day yes sir shall do exploits brother Donnie you only believe that because you was a Pentecost I believe that because that's what the message teaches and the Bible teaches if I'd have been a if I'd have been a Catholic pope and I had a SE of God inside of me got to believe it once I come to this word come on somebody it's the truth that ain't got nothing to do with anything what I experienced in Pentecost would run me away from the supernatural because of all the false that I saw brother Tim brother Ron and myself was sitting talking the other day when we was together brother Tim was talking about well we can't let all this stuff hinderous I said absolutely brother Tim I totally agree and I said it never hindered me when I was in Pentecost and it ain't going to hinder me now I am not going to be held back because there's false ones I am not going to be held back because people hit and miss hit and miss call this person out Miss hit call this one out hit hit Miss I'm not interested in hit Miss I believe my God don't lie I don't believe my God hits and misses I believe God hits right on target every time well brother Donnie if there's false out there then we shouldn't have it at all you can let them scarecrows scare you if you want to but I ain't a crow so scarecrows don't scare crow eagles they scare crows hallelujah how many knows we need the supernatural like never before my goodness friends with the needs that we have Among Us in our own church body we need need Miracles we need healing we need a supernatural God to move Among Us don't you let the things around you get to discouraged our brothers and sisters need us like never before to believe with them let me read this to you again from Joel to be glad then the children of Zion rejoice in the Lord your God for he has given you the former Reign moderately notice how Joel says it moderately so it was not a delou it was not a flood but how did the former Reigns come now remember it's the land of Israel and many of the Nations around the earth parts of Africa we know are the exact same way also some of the Asiatic places exactly the same way so they will get the former rings and then they will get what they call the monsoons and the monsoons is what will produce the crop so it will come moderately it will break up the soil make the soil compatible to receive seed then the farmers go along behind in the so seed it'll get a little bit of a zooza over here and a little zooza over here and they'll have a little bit of an outbreak of a Revival over there and another outbreak but they're want more than that they thank God for that I don't know about you I thank God for every little Revival we can have up here and there but I'm looking for the lighter rain to come and the lighter rain I'm looking for is not everybody in the message rallying around one preacher or one church it's actually everybody in the message is Call Of God rattling around the Lord Jesus in the resurrection now watch let us go to spoken words original see whenever the prophet preaches this and if you haven't heard it be good for you to go back and listen to it it ain't but about 6 hours and 5 minutes or something I catch whenever you get plenty of time now what we're trying to do they're trying to manufacture a latter rain nonsense while the louter rain will sweep the world brother notice how he puts it in the future will and then a farmer rain sewing word right now you see what the latter rain produces you'll find out there being an affiliation now watch what the latter rain will produce for The ecumenical and the Pentecostals the Pentecostals and all the groups will come together and they'll shut the doors on them guys that won't listen to it so that's the spirit even among and around this message that wants to shut down people from having church it's not the spirit of God it's the spirit of antichrist well praise the Lord praise the Lord it don't take many quotes but I'll just give you one or two God's Prophet said in Christ The Mystery of God reveal of God is in your heart you can't wait till them doors back there open up to be able to get into the house of God to fellowship with your brothers and sisters he said God goes to church 1964 he tells the new converts there in his meeting now find you a home Church cause without a church home you will die spiritually that's I find that amazing because that's what I hear when I press play wow now watch so already now this is 1962 already har they were trying to manufacture a lad rain now you don't know how hard that is even now for me and Harry and brother Larry and different ones that used our gift in manufacturing under Pentecost cuz God gifts you and gives you the ability to play music and to sing and then you use that to get the people going and going and shouting and jumping and running that's right you don't know how it feels when you come to the truth and then you become washed and you look back at what you use your god-given gift for let me just tell you how it makes you feel it makes you feel like you prostituted your gift and then whenever you go to playing for God in the real light of the word it's like this line before you that you never want to cross over you you you're walking this tight rope and oh God God please God please help us help us that we don't prostitute help us Lord that we don't try to build your people up with music and make them emotional you know I love music you know I believe in singing and D dancing and shouting but let me tell you one thing the prophet of God said that whenever you get to a place that you think you've got to shout and you've got to dance you haven't been to church or you're afraid what your neighbor will think about you you are drinking from a stagnated sister people think a f form is only somebody sitting there not moving their arms oh no that's only one kind of form there's another kind of form that does this every service and as soon as the music slows down everybody stops dancing well in the same quote the prophet said you don't need the music to dance he said as a matter of fact if they're playing near my God to thee you'll keep right on dancing and right on SHO but a lot of folks dance as long as the music's going wide open and when the Music Stops they St then when the music starts they start what are you doing operated by a juke box somebody drops a nickel down in you or a quarter down in you and it turns your shout on and your shout off Oh Glory to God I want our church to be able to shout if the music is slow if the me music is mediocre if the music is fast because the shout ought to be inside of your soul not regulated by the organ player not regulated by the drummer or the piano player but the Holy Ghost bubbling up inside of [Applause] you I was trying to make sure I didn't that gunpowder now friends I have a problem whether it's Pentecostals or message trying to manufacture letter ring cuz ain't none of us got no manufacturing machine for latter rain we can manufacture motion we can manufactur movement and all that sort of St oh you say glory to God Brother Don where the bride mov manal life we got shouting and dancing and running in our church we're only one of the very few churches that have it all you got to do is go to YouTube you top in Pentecostal shoting and Pentecostal dancing you'll find all kinds of them you'll find even some Baptists that are still out there old southern baptist that's shouting and dancing well come on somebody they're running they're jumping they're shouting they're having prayer lines people are getting healed so if that's a bride's Revival then that means they've got it woo the latter rain is not just healing the latter rain is not just Miracles but this latter rain is going to be former teaching and latter what is it watering the word it will anoint the word and yes there will be Miracles yes the dead will be raised [Applause] we've already seen a couple of dead folks rais in our church the prophet said that there' be A Time coming missing limbs would be restored but we want the rain to fall on pure word seed not on hybridized stuff and you know what's the most deceiving thing you and I was going to face in the last days message hybridized with Pentecost our message hybridized with Baptist cuz everybody in the message don't like movement they're more Cemetery type people true brother icicle in the pullit ice cubes in the pews and then our little children are ice collettes so there 90 little ice cubes so our little young people sat there and they sat there and you know they text back and forth and do this and that and the other while church is going on cuz you can't wait till church is over I don't want no ice cubes in our church I don't want our young people to be little bitty ice cubes well Glory I love it to see our front rows up here fill with young people I don't understand why in the world these front rows ain't full of people what the world's matter to y'all how come you want to set back Yonder you Scar the fire what in the world have you found back there that ain't up here and more of it I don't understand why in the world you ought to be fighting for the first front row s it up here or you say you spit my face well that won't hurt you you can wipe it off Oh Glory to God we don't want an icicle in the Pulpit we don't want ice skids in the p you we want people on fire with the baptism of the Holy [Applause] Ghost my goodness I know that that packet this morning that I opened said unfrosted strawberry poptart I know it did not say Locust and Wild Honey now you'll see what the latter rain produces and you'll find out there be an affiliation the Pentecostals and the groups will come together and they'll shut the door on them guys that won't listen to it you won't even be able allowed Lotus to open your mouth so what spirit is it hanging around the message message then that don't want preachers to open their mouth it ain't from the Bible it's from Hell well go ahead brother Donnie I notice when this comes listen that's when he'll come that's when he'll show that's when you'll see a rain oh my they still be quiet Let It Go the Hebrew word Mor now Mor means teaching in other words it'll be a teaching rain and a harvest rain so do we stop teaching then when the latter rain comes can't you see why God loves a balanced preacher yeah you most time you have got one or one you know one on one side one on the other side of the ditch I get so sick of cleaning out ditches anybody understand what I'm saying when I was in Pentecost man I lived in the ditch I went down through the ditch I mean I cleaned out ditches I was upside one side down the ditch and down the other whenever I come out of there I was so scared of Pentecost I was scared of God even speaking to him anymore and I went out of a Pentecostal dish over into a message ditch but this is the mystery part about it have you ever met anybody that thought that wasn't in the middle of the road everybody you talk to thinks they in the middle of the road every Pastor believes his church is right in the middle of the road every preacher thinks he's in the middle of the road well either I don't understand what the middle of the road is or this is a wide Road I I we got a problem somewhere everybody cannot be in the middle of the road we've got everything in the world in and around this message but I'm here to encourage you tonight and let you know there is true seed there are true Christians there are true believers and it's going to produce the lighter rain it yes sir it'll be a teaching rain don't you understand it ain't want to be Miracles ever night it's amazing to me that some of the brothers in the message it's all they ever preach Deliverance Miracles healing Miracles Deliverance healing Miracles Deliverance every service necess a l of rain no my brother no Moray still comes with it why cuz there might be one here tonight or five or three or four that ain't in yet they still need a preacher that'll sell that word inside of the heart they might be the last quickening to go away come on children oh yes we believe in that Supernatural but we don't stop sewing hallelujah we're still sewing seed here at our church well while we're enjoying the Miracles and the signs and the Wonders I'm hoping there be somebody here tonight get filled with the Holy Ghost they're not be somebody here that not get delivered from some old church enti [Applause] Spirit look this is the balance of it brother Nathan quoted here on Sunday Proverbs 11:1 always been one of my favorite scriptures I quote it like crazy in Pentecost I didn't understand it a false balance is an abomination in the eyes of the Lord but it just Waites his Delight look what the latter rings going to be some say all the latter in his sister Mysteries it's just the teaching the other say oh no no no we're getting away from all that teaching say well brother R said this brother R said that we don't need that no more we're moving beyond well you go ahead and move all you want to we're staying right here but there's got to be people somewhere who will say wait a minute wait a minute didn't he say it would be former teaching and latter together praise God oh now we've had the teaching rain I'm we ready for the Harvest rain you know the first rain is when you plant the seed start your crop growing then just before it matures there comes another crop that's one they'll call the Harvest rain now when it's the spring rain and the rains about June it makes your crop now remember he's quoting seasonally according to the seasons here not in Israel because theirs were not in June but he's quoting what he's familiar with here oh my we're at the end time the sea are SE now the latter rain is fixing to come forth remember there will come such a denominational Gathering pretty soon it'll be terrific wow a denominational Gathering and it'll be terrific and they will bring themselves together into this Federation of churches then this kind of a church will be put out of operation I love these words in parenthesis as far as they know other have shut down our church they may shut her down but we can have church in your basement my basement your basement and your basement they may take our building away from us but they will never shut us up they will never shut us down well Hallelujah somebody it may th us down because we may find out everybody that was Among Us didn't really believe it know how but that's when the real true seedle put forth everything they're supposed to [Applause] produce oh my it's at that time that Jesus will appear and he will show which is bride yes sir and which is not my friends this is The Showdown The Showdown will be those who are bride and those who aren't yes sir and it ties into the personage of the Lord Jesus himself amen so the fullness of the latter rain will never be climaxed in my Ministry in mother Daryl's Ministry or any other message preacher it would be climaxed in the appearing of our Lord Jesus so when preachers go to pulling you toward them you know right there sign of a false one if he really understands the word he's going to say I'm only a channel I'm only a way that God can speak to you but the one we're pointing you to is right up here of the Lord Jesus right up here look at all these message clicks and Cults and clams have been and they pointed you to a certain city somewhere where this certain man got this great Revelation about this or that or the other and out of there come their little boys and they go to preaching the same thing and then they go to Conquering the world with all their Doctrine and if you don't believe what they believe then you're out every one of them goes back to a man somewhere but this latter name don't point to a man it points to God it don't point to New York City it don't point to Jeffersonville it don't point to Johnson City it points to Heaven Oh Glory to God it didn't start with man it won't end up with man look at Oral Roberts and the Pentecostals there's been a teaching rain gone forth now notice where we are right now we've got the Benny hens we've got all the television preachers and all the prophets that's on YouTube and all the prophets that's on TV you know we've even got men that are quoting brother brandom one of the brothers at the church s me one the other day of a man saying that brother brandham you know prophesied that there'd be a woman president and he's trying to say of course to this Cala Harris and he said you know that that this Prophet prophesied about it and wrote it on a yell a piece of paper and so on and so on and you think well that's that's well and good but that ain't exactly what he said he said that it could have been the Catholic church or it could have been a woman present hey you what they're going to do if they're going to make brother brandom say that and if she don't get it then who's going to look bad not them they're going to blame brother Brandon for it why because they misapplied what he said I find it amazing they pick the things they want I pick the things I don't like uhhuh well there's things about this message it's hard to swallow there's things about this message that burns me up well come on somebody there's things about this message that'll make you pout there's things about this message that'll make you cry there's things about this message that'll burn your heart and turn you every Way but Loose but when you get done it turns you every way and loose because we don't pick just what we want we want what we need God give me a spank and God give me a woman but give me whatever I need to get ready to leave this world woo glory to God look at or Roberts the pentecostes have been a teaching Reign a national teaching Reign communism wow a national teaching rain wow communism but you see As Americans we listen to our politicians talk and we don't even know that beneath their fine fancy words is principles of Communism well we have everything in common and the poor illiterate average person that don't even know oh we're going to take away from the rich we're going to take away from the rich and we're going to spread it Out Among the poor people communism we're going to control grocery store prices communism I've been in communist countries around the world friends and talk to people who live under it and whenever you live under it it's a whole lot different than what Tim Walls would like to tell you as a matter of fact I heard him say the other day that communist China had some real principles that we in America could really love and dumb American people would vote for such a thing well brother Donnie you ain't supposed to preach politics I'm supposed to preach the truth why years ago the American people would have grabbed that man by the ear and throw him into the Atlantic and sunk it they would have grabbed a lot of these politicians and sent them in a slow boat to China they would have never stood for it but now they swallow it right down Hook Line and Seeker why seeds of Communism and now it's coming up in the average United States citizens heart it well that makes a lot of sense to me I'm a poor person I don't think it's fair for these old sorry stinking rich people take it away from them take it away from them give it to all the rest of us that's the way it ought to be do away with capitalism uhhuh you're under that same communistic Spirit ain't you remember the the disciples tried that for a little while in the book of Acts they didn't make it work either sting burn ouch Scorch come on there will be one person who can make everything in common work not Putin not Harrison walls not Trump nobody else how in the world did I get off on that brother Jack did you need that I guess you did sitting there you needed that my there's been a national teaching rign communism sold amongst the people every nation you so denominational seed when the Holy Ghost fell it made a denominational Revival you see this is where we are if we're not careful the hibid seeds of message plus usza Street Pentecost merged together that was sown Years Ago by some of the preachers when the rain falls on it it'll come forth boy it will be man it'll be considered life yeah it'll be considered a church is alive they'll even the DAP sayings like a church alive is worth the drive real poetic right well I'm sorry your pastor is not much of a poet I'm more of a fire and brimstone guy I ain't interested in my words rhyming I ain't interested in tickling your ear I want your soul to be so full of the Holy Ghost you can look lost in the face you can look in the face you can look death in the face and say back off death back off cancer back off TB you don't make me [Applause] afraid oh my oh goodness friends this is where we will have to be so close oh I hear him say listen little church the church in the last days will be twins same movement same mother but different fathers it will be a Pentecostal move and it will be so close it would deceive the very elected if it were possible don't think it's just restricted to Africa there's a man right now in Africa that has this ministry so-called the dead are being raised the sick are being healed all kinds of things are happening phenomenal Miracles Gathering thousands and thousands seemingly started off really really good preaching the message supposedly going fine seemed like for ever so long but something changed brother Tim showed me a clip of it the other day we were together and now when the man comes into church the people are bowing before him worshiping him breaking off branches and throwing in his paths calling him Elohim around the ranks of our message seeds were sown for such a thing oh my goodness so that seed was sown years ago oh yeah and it's got to produce a crop and where would it produce itself Among Us among us but watch what it will do you see Pentecost never receive their messenger I hope you understand this that the church A's messenger comes at the end of the age so God actually sent lucier at the end of the C age sent West at the end of the Lutheran age on down on down and God sends brother Brandon at the end of the Pentecostal age but they refused Elijah's meal offering so Pentecost had poison in the pot remember that in the Old Testament that they went out and gathered herbs and they didn't realize what this Gathering and whenever they cooked them all up at the assemblies and you know the Church of God and all that stuff and they they cooked it all up and then they looked down at the pot and they said oh there's death in the pot there's death in the pot so what did they do they call for Elisha to come over what did he do he got some meal now the meal of course represented Christ and the birds had to be cut a certain way and then they would grind the corn and every little bit of that would come out out ground the same yesterday and forever and then Elisha spread it across the pot and it brought healing to the pot now he said eat it it won't kill you now what did Pentecost do they refused Elijah's meal offering in their pot of the godhead so Elijah throw in the meal that it was not three Gods but it was one God in three offices but they didn't want the meal in the off in the in the pot so he also said for us about the gifts I want you to notice and you'll be able to tell even around our message if it's a true spirit of God operating gifts and it's acts two gifts or if it's a zeusa street gifts because Pentecost refused Elijah's meal offering in their seething hot of gifts now if you think that brother brandham only preached gifts at the brandom Tabernacle you need to do a little broader search he preached It All Over America cuz he wasn't just sent to Brandon Tabernacle he was sent to try to correct Pentecost don't you understand in his ministry is two great advents William Brandon was sent as a messenger to to the leoan church but God is going to use his ministry I hope it don't blow you away but this is why he could say in shreport in 1965 the Elijah of this day is the Lord Jesus Christ now you see for the carnal-minded people they want to make that him no he was the messenger to the Le ofan Church Christ come to call a bride age but it was revealed through the ministry of the prophet of Malachi 4 Bo some of y'all are big ey of me tonight y'all must eat Pepper for supper but look what God did unlike any other age he brought this man and he kept pouring it in there and he poured in the seething pot of emotion they wouldn't have it he poured it in there about the gifts and said these gifts need to be operated such and such a way they wouldn't have oh we're not having we're not giving up our freedom quench the spirit of God and you know what breaks my heart is you see that same attitude happening right around the message right now oh we got freedom in our church we're not going that way so then that makes some of our message people refusing Elijah's meal offering in their pot which means their inspiration is not the original acts two it's Aza street again did the air conditioner shut off brother William you need to check that thing man it's hot in the firecracker in here tonight A man I li now come on friends we got this message we wanted as a cafeteria we want to study hundreds and hundreds of quotes and prove we're supposed to have gifts and Deni them others where he tells us how to use them and we refuse Elijah's meal offering but Brother D if we put them in the back room what are we going to have we're going to have them right that's what we're going to have right or we're going to have a repeat of ausa Street and remember I'm sowing seeds every Pastor sewing seeds in this message every preacher is sewing seeds and if there's another five years another 10 those seeds will start coming up so we are sewing a hybrid message and a Susa Street what will it produce let's stand woo listen this what we need is get back to the word get back to the real word of God and bring forth a bride to Christ and the word true back to the word how can you plant wheat here and wheat here and say I'm going to get cucumbers here and wheat here yes you can't do it the only way you're going to get cucumbers I mean this is deep right man don't you love this deep theology wow the only way you're going to get cucumbers is plant cucumbers there's only one way we're going to produce a Rapture only one way we're going to produce a virgin bread so that word in so that word I wonder what all the churches will have around the world on all the preachers that we have how many really are pure seed preachers that are actually Unix you see that's what they would do when a king would have a Harum he wanted wanted men there to watch over the Queen the wives his Herm but he did not want men capable of fathering children so they would get Unix and if they weren't Unix they would make Unix out of them that way they could have the strength of a man the courage of a man the ability to War as a man because a man thinks different than a woman we know that yeah but you don't want that man with the ability to Father his own children under the roof of the King's Castle so he would make them unic oh alas down to the years how many preachers have come and gone many of them started out saying they unics it didn't take long till they started raising up people in their church that look just like them that's right believe it or not I know some message preachers that that's so naturally uhhuh so they get the preacher Spirit why he's their father and that's why you can show them look God's Prophet said this but your pastor saying so and so well I don't care I'm going to stay with him well I guess you should cuz he's your daddy so if he goes to hell go on with it but if your father is the word then if Donnie Reagan darl Ward Jackie Benton whoever leaves the word you'll leave them before you'll leave Christ Jesus is that right Saints you see it's that type of people when them Galatians come in there and Paul old brother BR talks about in the church age book and he said Paul when he talked about them saints when even in the Book of Revelation he said you have tried them which say they are Apostles and are not you have found them Liars he said oh my that sets my soul on fire who are they to try these people who call themselves Apostles he said they tried them by the the word and they were not saying what Paul said and remember these weren't Bishops and deacons and trustees it was the saints of God I mentioned it to you before if the saints of God would refuse to give ear to false teachers that'd be no need for them but it's based upon supply and demand some preachers can preach Humpty Dumpty as God and some people would follow him I know you're laughing at that you think it's crazy if You' been believe some of the stuff I've heard that message preachers and preach some of them that used to be with us some of the utter complete nonsense you realize when you walk away from truths you're successible to anything look friends as your friend as your brother as your pastor I'm telling you tonight run with all of your soul into this word not me not so much our church not after this man that man but make sure the word is your father that's the type of material when carolly and I stood several years ago at the Roman Coliseum still there in Rome and you walk inside of there and you look around you can't keep from tears coming out of your eyes and sadness filling your heart as you think how many of our brothers and sisters were fed the lines were cutting shreds by gladiators but they were willing to do it then we went to the catacombs which is nothing but Solid Rock soft top rock I forget the Strat of the name of it there in Italy but the graves are not built like you would think but they're built back like this so they go in and cut them out a solid rock and have a space in between just have them ried in there like that but it was a safe place for the Saints to have church too bad they didn't understand that you could be able to be a secret believer and not really have to go to church like some of the folks do today stay home and play tapes nobody knows you're a Believer nobody knows you know you just kind of keep it everything to yourself and you don't let your light so shine before men and all that sort of thing it's really sad to me that all those thousands of people lost their lives you mean God let them people give their lives and he's going to let us get by on such a lazy rotten scheme no he's not M that's the kind of Christian I want to be Brother Don you want to be a martyr nope I sure don't NOP I'm not going to lay my head right down here tonight say all right somebody come up here and cut it off but if God ordained me for such a purpose he'll give me strength to do it I'm showing him my strengths under the anointing of this age which is what a flying eagle and the Eagles don't sit around with a butter knife eating croissant rolls they don't sit around eating cinnamon buns and sitting around with their little cloth and the little dainty napkins wiping icing off of their mouths they reach down and grab a hold to that carcass and that Bloody word is all over their face all over their mouth I thought oh my God one day them Old Testament Saints will come forward they'll come out of the ground Hallelujah proudly displaying the blood of Jesus Christ the message of God for the hour they lived in wait till it hits friends you see Miracles alone ain't it cuz the Pentecost say are having them shouting jumping meetings Pentecostals are having them theology the Episcopal have that it'll be a mixture of both but it can't just be any word it's got to be the word for our season so if Elijah sprinkle meal on the gifts are you going to take the meal version or the seething pot version I had that version before and I ain't going back to that are we amen I figure some of you oldtimers that done seen it before y'all would just about cause a Revolt if I started bringing back the seething pot of 1906 we don't have to take that let Elijah sprinkle the meal of the anointed word on there and let's pull the gifts out perfect gifts instead of oh I feel there somebody here tonight oh oh it's over on this high for the church somebody over in this section has got a pain who ain't somebody's got a burden who ain't and call it discernment nonsense God's Prophet said there'll be one to an age come on children not a dozen what uhhuh you know what that was that just give you meal why he kept trying to pour it on the Pentecost Oh no you're trying to think you're the only one get away from here he said go on there I want the meal version how many he wants it with me oh my oh goodness I don't know maybe I need a vacation or something like prolonged it's coming Miss B it oh Jesus it's no wonder that your Prophet so Cried Out Lord to bring the word pure he knew he was a planter I know it too I know I am and I know I'm going to have to answer for what I sow help me Jesus help me May every preacher realize every time they stand by behind the pulpit to preach their sewing seeds Lord God I pray for your men around the world help them Jesus to understand the awesome responsibility that they are called to be Unix not to pregnate the bride with their own seed thoughts opinions ideas but simply to carry your seed SE word that's what we're called to do and let that seed word go into the souls of the Bride [Music] hallelujah we're having little revivals little rains we're still sewing we're still still waiting and oh how we thank you for the showers that comes and Lord we're waiting we're waiting for the Harvest cycle Lord Jesus if there's anything in us that displeases you please father show us I stand before you tonight God I stand before these hundreds of people I stand before an international audience of message people around the world and I realize what I preach tonight it can be all over the world by tomorrow night this time there'll be critics there'll be all kinds of things but yet Lord I know I'm going to have to stand before you I don't want to produce people out of this church that are little Donnie Reagan they act like me they talk like me they sing like me they want to be like me why in the world would they want to be like me when they can be like you oh Jesus help me help these other ministers here in our church father to realize what a responsibility they have may we bring the meal applied to the theology just because we've got scripture don't mean it's in line we can have scriptures and be misaligned because we miss the application of the meal of the end time we can take scriptures and put them together and can make the pot Seas because we've got it put together wrong your message did not come father to replace the Bible or replace the scriptures but to help our thinking as ministers to we be able to study under the mind of Christ to know what you want done with your word the season the time the allocation for the Age We Live help us Lord I wonder how many of you Saints tonight you say Lord that's the kind of bride I want to be I want that word in my heart if there's any hybrid Doctrine in me any hybrid seed in me Lord take it out tonight father Lord Jesus we raise our hands and I pray for them in a different way now may every man woman boy or girl every singer every musician every songwriter whatever we are father search my heart Jesus may my heart be a fertile ground by which the seed can grow I saw a striking image the other day and it was the shape of a human ear and someone had superimposed a a baby that was being formed in the mother's womb and said that the womb was shaped almost like a human ear and there was talking about the emphasis of how important is what we allow to our hearing because it's an inlet to our soul oh Lord God may we be careful who we listen to I ain't just on my charismatic preachers neither there's some message people we need to be careful who we listen to too father our ears become a Gateway an entrance into the bedding ground oh Lamb of God we want to bring forth the purity of this message oh there's been all kinds of messes and all this and that and the other of course the devil always does that but in spite of all that there'll be a virgin bride that'll be produced out of this message yes may part of them go from this assembly Lord God I believe I'll be part of it I believe with all of my heart I will but Lord let me say if there's anything in me tonight that displeases you show me help me to see it Lord I preached to too many people Lord to lead anyone as stray help me Lord Purge me wash me with hisp and I will be clean Lord God may I eat Elijah's treated porridge make Christ the meal offering be poured in my perception of election may it be poured in my perception of predestination it's evident some of the message people don't have Christ the meal offering in their IDE ology of predestination because they think they're predestinated can live any life they want to live they need Christ the meal offering and that seething pot of corruption it'll cleanse that pot oh Jesus pour it in our worship father pour Christ the meal offering in our worship then we won't come to church and stand here and never move and never raise our hands or never lift our voices neither will we be to the other side what we feel like if we don't shout over service we haven't had a meeting but it'll be balanced porridge a balanced diet because it will be the meal offering Christ that we'll pour into there to be able to get our emotions praise be to God and sink our emotions up with our love hallelujah oh Lord God pour Christ the meal offering and our doctrines in our worship and our time in our lives Grant it Lord Jesus we worship you tonight father We Worship You Lord God how many he loves him with all of your heart maybe you just stand there right now maybe the Lord's brought something to your heart in this service or even now or we been standing to our feet a little something you need to fix a little something you need to take care of a little something you realize is not quite right why don't you just ask him Lord would you just take care of it right now you know what he wants to do he wants to pour that meal offering and that little dose of them things that you've gathered together there's no way you and I believe those sons of the prophets went out there on purpose and gathered poison gourds on on purpose to kill the whole message they were sincere they L God they love the people and they were simply trying to help and trying to prepare a meal that they thought would be beneficial but little did they realized that got poisoned gourds maybe there's sincere preachers that'll hear this and maybe brother maybe you've been sincere with all your heart but you've not really searched it well enough and you preached it before you should have and you found something after you preached it be a big enough man my brother be a big enough man to go back before your congregation and tell them you've got to repr preach this a little bit different with a big dose of meal hallelujah hallelujah we worship you tonight Jesus We Worship You Lord God can we just raise our hands for just a few minutes before we go I know our kids have got school and many of you got work and stuff tomorrow but just before we go may Jesus just pass by our way tonight maybe there's somebody that needs needs healing in your body I'm here tonight as a servant of God to pour Christ the meal off offering stand against that sickness in your body that demon that's trying to take your life and that poison that's trying to cut your life short in the name of Jesus receive Christ the meal offering for he was wounded for your transgressions and by his stripes you are healed receive your healing tonight in the name of Jesus hallelujah hallelujah we worship you Lord Jesus the Justin sing something for us can we just worship him a little bit would you mind say just a

coldness in your life you're rubbing shoulders of layout of SE you feel yourself indifferent you feel yourself not not where you really need to be it's not that you're running out in the world and
