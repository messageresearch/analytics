[44:49] place in our
[44:50] hearts weren't we tremendously blessed
[44:53] by this past
[44:55] weekend praise the Lord
[45:02] brother Nathan I thought just did a did
[45:05] an outstanding job someone told me that
[45:08] there was a a a meeting that was held
[45:10] recently it was a message meeting and um
[45:15] there was some different younger
[45:16] preachers that was there and preached
[45:18] and the man that was hosting the meeting
[45:21] supposed to be an elder in the message
[45:23] got up and said how refreshing it was to
[45:26] him to hear preachers preach without
[45:30] quotes I thought that was about one of
[45:33] the dumbest things I ever heard in my
[45:37] life
[45:38] really if we're going to gather around a
[45:41] denomination let's forget the
[45:43] identification of the message of the
[45:44] hour if we're going to believe it let's
[45:47] preach
[45:50] it praise the Lord
[45:57] I told carot we went home I said I'm
[45:59] reminded her of that statement that that
[46:01] Minister had said and I said it done my
[46:04] heart good to hear a young preacher
[46:06] stand there and preaching the message
[46:08] laying the message right out I thought
[46:10] praise the Lord let your servant die in
[46:14] peace I'll tell you friends if you only
[46:17] could hear some of the
[46:19] trash and nonsense that I hear that
[46:23] preachers that's supposed to believe
[46:25] this message are preaching it make you
[46:27] realize why I say the things I just
[46:30] said this message is not a treasure to
[46:34] everyone who says they believe it it's
[46:37] no more to some than just a dictionary
[46:40] or you know something else they just
[46:42] kind of pick up and look at when they
[46:44] want to well I'll tell you one thing
[46:46] when God revealed this message to me
[46:48] years ago I didn't get it as a
[46:50] dictionary I got it as a word a message
[46:55] sent from God Amen
[46:57] it changed my life I believe it's
[46:59] changed yours not only that it's still
[47:02] changing
[47:04] us amen God bless you well I didn't eat
[47:07] gunpowder for supper and I didn't eat
[47:09] Locust and wild honey for breakfast so
[47:12] rest easy everybody rest easy Jeremiah
[47:16] chap 5:
[47:18] 24 praise the Lord Jeremiah chapter 5
[47:21] verse
[47:23] 24 neither shall they say in their
[47:27] heart let us now fear the lord Our God
[47:31] that give us
[47:32] reain both the former and the latter in
[47:37] his
[47:38] season he reserve unto us the appointed
[47:43] weeks of the Harvest now remember in the
[47:45] Old Testament it was a natural in the
[47:48] New Testament of course it's a type to
[47:50] us
[47:51] spiritually Hosea
[47:55] 6:3 then shall we
[47:57] know if we follow on to know the
[48:02] Lord his going forth is prepared as the
[48:08] morning and he shall come unto us as the
[48:12] rain I want you to notice now not his
[48:15] doctrines not his
[48:18] theology but he will come to us as the
[48:23] rain as the latter and the former rain
[48:27] unto the Earth you see those who have a
[48:29] real understanding of the Moray the
[48:32] teaching of the word they realize the
[48:35] teaching of the word is Christ in word
[48:40] format so that's why they hold on to it
[48:42] with everything they are they don't look
[48:45] at it as just a fleeting passing
[48:48] something and they're waiting for
[48:49] something greater the greater is what
[48:52] quickens
[48:54] this he shall come unto us as the rain
[48:57] as the latter and the former reain unto
[49:00] the Earth Joel 2 verse
[49:03] 23 be glad then ye children of Zion I
[49:08] remember naturally Zion of the Old
[49:10] Testament Zion in the New Testament is
[49:13] the bride be glad then you children of
[49:15] Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God
[49:19] how many believes that need to do a
[49:20] little bit of more rejoicing around here
[49:23] rejoice in the Lord your God notice he
[49:26] don't say rejoice in your back aches
[49:28] rejoice in inflation Rejoice because
[49:31] it's an election year Rejoice because of
[49:34] this and that but rejoice in the Lord
[49:36] sometimes it's hard to Rejoice if your
[49:38] back's killing you it's hard to Rejoice
[49:40] if you got a headache but if you can
[49:42] rejoice in the Lord you can Rejoice no
[49:44] matter what you're dealing with that's
[49:47] right now notice why we can rejoice in
[49:50] the Lord your God for he has given you
[49:53] the former Reign moderately
[49:58] moderately and he will cause to come
[50:02] down for you the rain the former rain
[50:06] now notice what
[50:07] happens when the latter rain
[50:11] falls when the former rain falls it
[50:14] falls
[50:16] moderately but when the latter rain
[50:18] falls you get two
[50:21] parts you actually get former and latter
[50:28] together but it only falls on those
[50:31] who've got the moay first notice what
[50:34] Joel said he will cause to come down for
[50:37] you the rain the former rain and the
[50:42] latter rain together this is what it's
[50:44] going to be now this is the way the
[50:45] prophet took it and plac this scripture
[50:47] and said that they would both fall
[50:49] together for he will cause to come down
[50:51] for you the rain the former rain and the
[50:54] latter rain in the first month may the
[50:58] Lord bless his words you may be
[51:00] seated how many believes are living in
[51:03] the end time amen I believe that with
[51:06] all of my heart we believe that of
[51:07] course for many many years and you know
[51:10] it it's amazing whenever we talk about
[51:12] the end time now as most of you know I
[51:15] come from a Pentecostal background so
[51:17] hearing the latter rain was something
[51:20] that I heard quite frequently it was
[51:23] actually something that I preached as a
[51:25] Pentecostal preacher
[51:27] now I believed in those days that I was
[51:30] experiencing the latter rain but what I
[51:34] didn't realize was that I was preaching
[51:37] and believing I was experiencing the
[51:40] latter rain but I didn't know I didn't
[51:43] even have the former rain yet because
[51:46] what I had was the teaching rain from
[51:51] ausa stre I did not have the Moray of
[51:55] Malachi 4 now I do not believe that I
[51:58] had a word birth under my Pentecostal
[52:03] experience I shouted I jumped I run I
[52:06] hollered I glorified God I preached I
[52:09] cast out Devils I laid hands on the sick
[52:11] I I saw crosseyed straightened out I saw
[52:15] phenomenal miracles in my Pentecostal
[52:18] Ministry but I was still preaching under
[52:22] a hybridized word so what did it predu
[52:26] use out of my life well I received
[52:30] hybrid seed I sowed hybrid seed so what
[52:34] did I produce out of the product of my
[52:37] Ministry now I know a lot of preachers
[52:39] can't stand up and say this because they
[52:42] don't know how to Humble thems I have no
[52:45] problem in saying it I preached false
[52:47] Doctrine I preached error I preached
[52:50] erroneous things I just didn't know it
[52:53] was false at the time I was preaching
[52:56] the very best that I had but once God
[52:58] showed me I was wrong I was big enough
[53:01] to look back and say you know what I
[53:04] preach wrong I preached things that was
[53:06] not the truth anybody say Amen to that
[53:09] tonight I wonder how many of y'all
[53:10] believed wrong before rest of you ain't
[53:13] nothing but balac
[53:15] Liars well if you've been saved very
[53:18] long at all you have believed wrong
[53:20] stuff because God don't save none of us
[53:24] and give us full Revelation the first
[53:26] day of our new birth God gives it to us
[53:30] by progression he gave it to the
[53:32] prophets by progression he actually gave
[53:36] it to Brother brandham by progression as
[53:39] well I understand a lot of message folks
[53:41] have a problem with that when you go to
[53:42] preaching it but that's their problem it
[53:44] ain't mine because I can Su prove this
[53:48] by what brother Rand said himself but I
[53:50] look back and I realized that had God
[53:53] not stopped me where I was
[53:57] I would have been going down the line of
[53:59] Benny hen Kenneth copelan and all of
[54:03] those men by now a man in my late 60s I
[54:06] would have been you know a rod Parsley
[54:09] all of those type of guys because those
[54:12] were men that were around the same time
[54:15] I was and they were being sown in their
[54:18] hearts by their forefathers and their
[54:21] predecessors a hybrid Pentecostal seed
[54:25] and it is now produced their crop all
[54:28] they're waiting for is the World Council
[54:31] of churches now remember the latter rain
[54:34] will fall on the bride and produce a
[54:36] Rapture the latter rain will fall on The
[54:39] ecumenical move and produce a World
[54:43] Council of churches that will bring them
[54:45] all under the headship of Rome it will
[54:48] fall on the those that are gathered
[54:51] together under the offices of Billy
[54:53] Graham and it will lead them on to
[54:57] embrace Sodom so this is why you find
[55:00] them knocking on the Methodist door and
[55:02] the methodists are letting them in you
[55:05] find them knocking on the Episcopalian
[55:07] doors and they're letting them in
[55:08] letting them become pastors letting them
[55:11] become Elders in the church is that
[55:13] right sure the Methodist Church held off
[55:15] for a long time but finally the
[55:17] mainstream body of it just a few months
[55:19] ago decided to go ahead and do it yeah
[55:21] there's actually Methodist people
[55:23] oldtime Methodist people that are
[55:25] pulling away from the Methodist church
[55:28] thank God they may have be one of those
[55:30] that'll be have life and come up in the
[55:32] tribulation period you know why they
[55:34] can't stand to see their Church going
[55:37] down into Sodom but we're not in Sodom
[55:40] in the first place now watch this seed
[55:43] that was sown under three main Planters
[55:47] a Billy Graham an O Roberts and an
[55:50] Elijah now I come up under that part
[55:53] which was an oril Roberts seed l so or
[55:57] Roberts then had an emphasis on Miracles
[56:00] Supernatural signs wonders but as far as
[56:03] theology having a doctrine of
[56:05] restoration to point to people back to
[56:07] the word he didn't have it he was not a
[56:10] restorer a man with a lot of Miracles I
[56:12] have nothing evil to say about the man
[56:14] but he had a lot of Miracles a lot of
[56:16] signs a lot of Wonders a lot of things
[56:19] that actually happened in his ministry
[56:21] but what did it lead to o r you Oral
[56:25] Roberts University well we don't have a
[56:28] brandom
[56:30] university we don't have a brandom
[56:32] university that's right because God's
[56:34] Prophet never left us a college he left
[56:37] us a new birth he never left us a
[56:40] college or a bunch of schools but he
[56:42] left us tape so where we could come back
[56:44] to the original word by the baptism of
[56:46] the Holy Ghost now think of where many
[56:50] of you would be tonight if it were not
[56:52] for the grace of God that had caught
[56:55] somewhere maybe maybe your grandfathers
[56:57] maybe your fathers your parents or
[56:59] somebody that actually caught the seed
[57:02] that was sown under the ministry of
[57:05] Elijah maybe you got it by a book or a
[57:07] tape or someone told you about it and
[57:10] there was a reciprocating part of that
[57:13] word which God showed in you when you
[57:15] were born now you wouldn't actually
[57:17] looking for it you might not have even
[57:19] known it was even out there but God
[57:22] allowed it to cross your path and when
[57:24] it did it was like something from that
[57:28] grabbed a hold of something in you and
[57:31] it was something you didn't want
[57:33] something you wasn't asking for
[57:35] something you wasn't even looking for
[57:38] and the two pieces come together as the
[57:41] Chinese did when they tore the tag of
[57:43] your laundry then whenever the tag
[57:46] Pieces come together it meant your
[57:48] laundry of your old sins was totally
[57:51] annihilated and you stand before God as
[57:54] if you never done it am now this is
[57:57] where of course the world is coming to
[57:59] the culmination of where we are now and
[58:02] this is why that we would have it would
[58:04] probably be frightening to us tonight to
[58:06] know how many politicians in Washington
[58:09] and also in Nashville and our you know
[58:12] our mayor departments and sheriffs and
[58:14] whatever more that are socialists and
[58:16] Communists and everything else and we
[58:18] would have never thought it but whenever
[58:21] we go back into the message the prophet
[58:23] told us that it was being seed down
[58:26] then in
[58:28] 1962 with seeds of Communism and then
[58:31] they wind up and we've got one that's
[58:33] even W to run to be vice president with
[58:36] communistic ties so they say our
[58:39] president existing now has communistic
[58:42] ties and this Senator and that
[58:44] Congressman well why don't they kick
[58:46] them out they're afraid to you know why
[58:49] they've got to remain there their seed
[58:51] was swn so our White House is riddle
[58:55] with it our mayor's offices all types of
[58:58] legal positions are ridd with or brother
[59:00] Donnie let's all get together and root
[59:02] them out we can't root them out but
[59:05] neither can they root us out why because
[59:08] it must come to the Harvest cycle we
[59:11] will never come back oh I know that
[59:13] people are prophesying and along the
[59:16] charismatics and them and you know
[59:17] they're out there prophesying America's
[59:20] going to have a Revival and you know
[59:22] this is going to take place and that's
[59:24] going to take place I'll tell you what
[59:25] it is is it's false prophecy there is no
[59:29] scripture America has turned down her
[59:32] chance at a Revival they may have an
[59:34] intellectual Gathering but they will
[59:36] never have a Gods sent Holy Ghost
[59:39] Revival now when the bride goes people
[59:42] will no doubt get all stirred and get
[59:44] scared and get terrified and they will
[59:47] go to altars and they will cry and they
[59:49] will M they will be so emotional and
[59:52] some of them will shout and dance and
[59:54] jerk and so on and really think they're
[59:56] getting something and they don't even
[59:57] realize the blood is no longer even on
[1:00:00] The Mercy Seat now that's going to be
[1:00:03] really sad is it not and yet what will
[1:00:06] it do now whenever we look at where we
[1:00:08] are now remember how that in the last
[1:00:11] days that whenever the prophet first
[1:00:13] looked at Pentecost and he identified
[1:00:17] actually now think about it that a
[1:00:18] prophet of God with a light he was
[1:00:21] walking in in the time he actually
[1:00:24] looked at that shove and he looked at it
[1:00:27] and called Pentecost the seed so he
[1:00:30] looked there and he saw that it was the
[1:00:32] seed now in the
[1:00:34] 1950s brother brandham actually said and
[1:00:38] believed I know you're going to get
[1:00:39] quiet and that's all right I'm used to
[1:00:41] quiet whenever I come over things like
[1:00:43] this but I believe we got some Believers
[1:00:45] in your night you'll be able to say Amen
[1:00:47] that the prophet himself believed and
[1:00:50] actually preached in the 50s that the
[1:00:53] latter rain was falling right then now
[1:00:57] he believed the lighter rain was
[1:00:59] following falling then in 1950 what's
[1:01:03] this expectation these signs shall
[1:01:05] follow them that believe he promised it
[1:01:08] and then he promised the former Reign
[1:01:10] and the latter Reign and we're living
[1:01:13] now have been for years under the latter
[1:01:18] rain so here this is
[1:01:21] 1950 so brother Brandon believe the
[1:01:24] lighter rain was
[1:01:26] falling oh my I figured y'all get quite
[1:01:29] and big eyed on me but notice now no
[1:01:32] friend don't don't let this CH you don't
[1:01:34] let it bother you let our Prophet grow
[1:01:36] in Grace the way we did why does this
[1:01:40] bother people I I just don't understand
[1:01:42] it I can follow a man like that that can
[1:01:44] say God showed him more I can't follow
[1:01:47] the William Brandon that a lot of these
[1:01:49] people have made they have a false
[1:01:51] prophet they're they're they're
[1:01:53] worshiping a man they're making an Idol
[1:01:56] out of him come on
[1:01:58] somebody watch now he says and we're
[1:02:00] living now have been for years under the
[1:02:03] latter rain again why I'm a holy rotor
[1:02:06] 1953 God in this last days is sending
[1:02:10] the latter rain now that's right power
[1:02:12] of the Holy Ghost coming back as sure as
[1:02:15] he sends the Wind and Rain there's a
[1:02:17] tree standing there to Rejoice again
[1:02:20] paragraph 66 God's pouring out the
[1:02:23] latter rain upon us now look look here
[1:02:26] he is in the midst of this revival so
[1:02:30] isusa Street which happened of course
[1:02:32] many years prior to this and there was a
[1:02:35] dying down now what did God do then God
[1:02:38] sent the angel to meet his prophet in
[1:02:42] 1946 and tell him that there's going to
[1:02:45] be another stiring so he looks at it and
[1:02:48] from where he's looking at it that God
[1:02:51] is sending this great move and from that
[1:02:54] one commission that was Revival fires
[1:02:57] all across the world is that right you
[1:02:59] familiar with that statement so then at
[1:03:02] the time he looks at it that that what
[1:03:05] happened after the commission of
[1:03:08] 1946 was actually the light of rain so
[1:03:11] notice what years that we're reading so
[1:03:14] 1950
[1:03:15] 1953 notice again now
[1:03:18] 1956 the time has come for the signs to
[1:03:21] follow the Believers where at the end
[1:03:24] time we're in in the latter rain so
[1:03:28] watch here he is mid-50s looking at the
[1:03:32] Revival that's going on friends it's
[1:03:34] going wide open I know we've seen great
[1:03:38] things in the message oh my for many
[1:03:40] years but we have seen nothing in
[1:03:43] comparison to what was going on in the
[1:03:46] 50s and the 60s I'm talking about tens
[1:03:50] of thousands of people and it wasn't one
[1:03:52] man here and one man there it was all
[1:03:55] all over the world that it was happening
[1:03:59] people being healed oh my of distorted
[1:04:03] members in their body blinded eyes come
[1:04:05] open and it was not just brother
[1:04:07] brandom's Ministry it was or Roberts it
[1:04:10] was Tommy Hicks it was TL Osburn it was
[1:04:13] one after another after another it was a
[1:04:17] global move and here stands brother
[1:04:20] randam looking at what's going on and he
[1:04:23] sees the rain falling the spirit of God
[1:04:26] is coming and a great thing was
[1:04:28] happening and he thinks it's the light
[1:04:31] of rain sir it's the light of
[1:04:38] rain but the teaching rain hadn't went
[1:04:40] forth yet so what was it it was
[1:04:46] rain now listen it was rain boy didn't
[1:04:51] you all enjoy the last couple of days of
[1:04:54] rain we got
[1:04:56] man wasn't that awesome well see I can
[1:04:58] see you didn't enjoy it near as much as
[1:05:00] I do cuz I've been coming over here
[1:05:02] about every day or every other day and
[1:05:05] watering all these hundreds of shrubs
[1:05:08] and watering this grass and watering
[1:05:10] this and coming over five six seven
[1:05:13] times a day and moving a sprinkler and
[1:05:16] setting it over here for two hours then
[1:05:18] come back and set it over there for two
[1:05:20] hours that's the way I do some saints
[1:05:23] sometimes I kind of get around them and
[1:05:24] sprinkle back back and forth and back
[1:05:26] and forth then I try to move over to
[1:05:28] this section of the church and then I
[1:05:30] try to move over to this section of the
[1:05:32] church oh when I saw that rain coming in
[1:05:35] I'd about have me a spell I was so happy
[1:05:38] oh I can tell some of y'all didn't even
[1:05:40] care if it rained or not if you had all
[1:05:42] the time invested into it that I did
[1:05:45] you'd be as smiling like a possum like I
[1:05:47] am tonight as well I was happy that it
[1:05:50] started raining I was happy when I woke
[1:05:53] up in the night and it was raining I was
[1:05:55] happy when I woke up in the morning and
[1:05:58] it was raining because it was a good
[1:06:00] sign our grass is going to live our
[1:06:03] trees are going to live well that's the
[1:06:05] way I feel about a good Holy Ghost
[1:06:08] shower when God sends Among Us my I feel
[1:06:11] like that's the way it was this weekend
[1:06:13] for us don't you it just started out and
[1:06:15] God started sending the rain in the
[1:06:17] first service and the next service is a
[1:06:19] little heavier then on Sunday morning he
[1:06:22] just gave us a total wash out I mean we
[1:06:24] was need deep we was having to just
[1:06:26] weigh down through the water it was so
[1:06:29] good and so fine amen I Rejoice I don't
[1:06:33] know about you I love the word I love
[1:06:36] the word but I love a little water on
[1:06:38] top of that word to make it Live come on
[1:06:41] somebody I don't just love going to
[1:06:44] church I love going to church to worship

[1:06:52] going to church and let the devil know
[1:06:54] whose side I'm on I don't go to church
[1:06:57] to act like a bump on a pickle and never
[1:07:00] move and barely back my eyes God saved
[1:07:04] me many years ago and he called me to be
[1:07:07] a worshipper he called me Hallelujah to
[1:07:10] give praise to his name I give him all
[1:07:13] the praise I praise no other man I
[1:07:16] praise no woman I give no one my heart
[1:07:19] felt praised but almighty God I was born
[1:07:23] to praise him I was born to to clap my
[1:07:26] hand I was born to dance a little bit I
[1:07:29] was born to bless the name of the Lord I
[1:07:32] was born to worship
[1:07:38] him I can do it when it's
[1:07:42] dry let's everybody praise the
[1:07:45] Lord I feel sorry for the song leaders
[1:07:47] that get up in come on let's everybody
[1:07:49] get with it now y'all sit there just
[1:07:51] just dries On The Desert Sands
[1:07:56] and they're looking at you thinking I'm
[1:07:58] so glad I ain't singing But one more
[1:07:59] song so I can sit down and let brother
[1:08:02] Donnie have this
[1:08:05] service but oh when they sang like there
[1:08:08] was a while ago and the spirit begins to
[1:08:10] come down ain't that amazing how it
[1:08:12] feels sing the same songs but it's just
[1:08:15] so good you just want to sing another
[1:08:18] stanza you just want to sing another
[1:08:20] verse why the presence of God the water
[1:08:23] is coming so here the the world not not
[1:08:27] now just in Jeffersonville not now in
[1:08:29] America but the world God in his Mercy
[1:08:32] was giving showers and
[1:08:35] showers and the prophet looks out and he
[1:08:38] says it must be the latter of
[1:08:43] rain but watch him in
[1:08:47] 1960 we formed churches great Lutheran
[1:08:50] Church Methodist Baptist
[1:08:52] Presbyterian all those great churches
[1:08:54] has come up during this
[1:08:57] time but we've never had exactly a
[1:09:04] promise a latter
[1:09:08] rain as we're prophesied to have amen
[1:09:13] testing one two one two testing one two
[1:09:15] everybody okay sir now so what did he
[1:09:20] see he saw great
[1:09:23] Revival but something's begin to
[1:09:26] change transition
[1:09:29] time oh my notice the title of this
[1:09:32] sermon former and latter rain in the
[1:09:36] last days there would be lighter rain
[1:09:38] and the former and lighter rain would be
[1:09:43] together so it will come together former
[1:09:48] and latter rain now remember at this
[1:09:50] time if he knows the word Mor he doesn't
[1:09:55] say it and he doesn't say it till a
[1:09:57] couple years later and when he first
[1:10:00] mentions it spoken words Original Seed
[1:10:02] he makes it sound like he just found it
[1:10:05] just found the word now in the last days
[1:10:08] there would be latter rain and the
[1:10:09] former and latter rain would be together
[1:10:11] now the first rain was in the
[1:10:13] East and the latter rain is in the west
[1:10:17] and in the latter rain both former and
[1:10:21] latter will be together again the same
[1:10:25] sermon he promised that there would be a
[1:10:27] light of rain in the church the church
[1:10:30] spiritual in the last days he pour out
[1:10:33] both former and latter rain remember
[1:10:35] former rain come first latter rain come
[1:10:38] second both former and latter rain in
[1:10:41] the same season well I'll tell you one
[1:10:43] thing I hope I'm
[1:10:45] alive when this season fully arrives
[1:10:48] amen because it's going to be former and
[1:10:52] lighter together
[1:10:55] yeah now remember this is his thinking
[1:10:58] in the way that he's approaching this in
[1:11:00] 1960 watch
[1:11:02] 1961 the prophet said there'd be a
[1:11:05] former and a l of rain and the latter of
[1:11:07] rain would be both former and latter of
[1:11:09] rain together a great church Universal
[1:11:13] that would sweep from one side of the
[1:11:16] world to the other side of the world a
[1:11:19] great
[1:11:21] message
[1:11:23] ah a great
[1:11:27] message so tell me what message or
[1:11:30] Roberts
[1:11:31] left and he all ever read any of his
[1:11:35] books nobody T osbor Tommy Hicks any of
[1:11:39] those guys none of
[1:11:41] you wow an't that amazing their names
[1:11:46] are famous but for
[1:11:48] what did they ever preach a Hebrew
[1:11:52] series no or an adoption series
[1:11:56] what about a question answers on
[1:11:58] jusis so what are they known for
[1:12:01] healings signs wonders Miracles not a
[1:12:06] message come on somebody now Paul had
[1:12:09] healing signs wonders and miracles but
[1:12:12] thank God for not only that but Paul
[1:12:16] left us a message in the New
[1:12:20] Testament praise the Lord now watch as
[1:12:24] the prophet begin to see this and it's
[1:12:26] like God is pointing him in in a
[1:12:30] direction a great message great signs
[1:12:34] and wonders would be accomplished by
[1:12:37] this church now this is why friends I
[1:12:39] absolutely cannot believe former and
[1:12:42] latter rain in the last day is only
[1:12:45] going to be cold dead
[1:12:48] theology no it is not it is more than
[1:12:51] just a bunch of doctrines that we come
[1:12:54] together and say set in the message
[1:12:55] church and the preacher stands up there
[1:12:57] and reads and reads and reads God didn't
[1:13:00] call me to read the gospel he called me
[1:13:02] to preach it well come on somebody and
[1:13:05] God not only called me to preach the
[1:13:08] gospel but he called me to
[1:13:10] demonstrate the gospel in other words to
[1:13:14] make Jesus Christ live
[1:13:17] again among his people so the message
[1:13:21] within itself and we know for years that
[1:13:24] this is the cycle that the message went
[1:13:26] through and some are still there I hate
[1:13:29] to say it this way tonight but when you
[1:13:31] look around we have a hybridizing that
[1:13:34] has gone on in the message for many many
[1:13:36] years men and early on I to the prophet
[1:13:39] left each one of them well many of them
[1:13:42] anyway said this away many of them you
[1:13:44] know trying to get a position so I was
[1:13:47] with him and he called my name he laid
[1:13:49] hands on me you know this one come up
[1:13:51] with this idea and then another one that
[1:13:53] was there with him he come up with this
[1:13:55] idea what was each one of them wanting a
[1:13:57] following of people then they began to
[1:14:01] hybridize the message in the same way
[1:14:04] the Pentecostals did theirs so why do we
[1:14:08] have so much chaos in and around the
[1:14:10] message today it's because those seeds
[1:14:13] were swn years and years
[1:14:15] ago well Hallelujah but let me give you
[1:14:20] a great big glory to God tonight because
[1:14:23] there were also men of God in that same
[1:14:25] time frame that were not interested in
[1:14:28] getting a following they were not
[1:14:30] interested in building a kingdom they
[1:14:32] were interested in preaching the message
[1:14:35] of the hour according to the scripture
[1:14:38] and by them men doing that it paved a
[1:14:41] way for us to be here
[1:14:43] tonight oh blessed be the Lord thank God
[1:14:48] for many of our forefathers in the
[1:14:51] message don't you appreciate them I do
[1:14:53] many of them we didn't even know but but
[1:14:55] thank God for many of those that stood
[1:14:57] up for the truth and they was not
[1:14:59] interested in building something for
[1:15:02] themselves they realized they was a part
[1:15:04] of the biggest thing there was why would
[1:15:07] I be so stupid to want to build a Donnie
[1:15:10] Reagan Kingdom which would be about that
[1:15:12] big around why would I want to do such a
[1:15:15] crazy thing when I am part of the
[1:15:17] biggest thing that has ever been as long
[1:15:20] as I stay in my place I don't need a
[1:15:23] Donnie Reagan King we don't need a Tim
[1:15:26] TR Kingdom a Ron Spencer Kingdom a Daryl
[1:15:30] Ward kingdom come on somebody what we
[1:15:32] want to do is be identified in the
[1:15:36] Kingdom of Jesus
[1:15:40] Christ oh praise the
[1:15:44] Lord so in this former and lighter rain
[1:15:48] there will be a great message great
[1:15:52] signs and wonders would be accomplished
[1:15:56] by this church Daniel said the people
[1:15:59] that know their God in that day yes sir
[1:16:02] shall do
[1:16:09] exploits brother
[1:16:11] Donnie you only believe that because you
[1:16:14] was a Pentecost I believe that because
[1:16:16] that's what the message teaches and the
[1:16:18] Bible
[1:16:19] teaches if I'd have been a if I'd have
[1:16:21] been a Catholic pope and I had a SE of
[1:16:24] God inside of me got to believe it once
[1:16:25] I come to this
[1:16:27] word come on somebody it's the truth
[1:16:30] that ain't got nothing to do with
[1:16:32] anything what I experienced in Pentecost
[1:16:35] would run me away from the supernatural
[1:16:38] because of all the false that I saw
[1:16:42] brother Tim brother Ron and myself was
[1:16:44] sitting talking the other day when we
[1:16:45] was together brother Tim was talking
[1:16:47] about well we can't let all this stuff
[1:16:48] hinderous I said absolutely brother Tim
[1:16:51] I totally agree and I said it never
[1:16:53] hindered me when I was in Pentecost and
[1:16:56] it ain't going to hinder me now I am not
[1:16:59] going to be held back because there's
[1:17:01] false ones I am not going to be held
[1:17:05] back because people hit and miss hit and
[1:17:08] miss call this person out Miss hit call
[1:17:10] this one out hit hit Miss I'm not
[1:17:13] interested in hit Miss I believe my God
[1:17:16] don't lie I don't believe my God hits
[1:17:20] and misses I believe God hits right on
[1:17:23] target every time
[1:17:29] well brother Donnie if there's false out
[1:17:31] there then we shouldn't have it at all
[1:17:33] you can let them scarecrows scare you if
[1:17:35] you want to but I ain't a crow so
[1:17:38] scarecrows don't scare crow eagles they
[1:17:42] scare
[1:17:44] crows
[1:17:45] hallelujah how many knows we need the
[1:17:48] supernatural like never before my
[1:17:50] goodness friends with the needs that we
[1:17:52] have Among Us in our own church body we
[1:17:54] need need Miracles we need healing we
[1:17:57] need a supernatural God to move Among Us
[1:18:00] don't you let the things around you get
[1:18:02] to discouraged our brothers and sisters
[1:18:04] need us like never before to believe
[1:18:07] with
[1:18:08] them let me read this to you again from
[1:18:10] Joel to be glad then the children of
[1:18:13] Zion rejoice in the Lord your God for he
[1:18:15] has given you the former Reign
[1:18:17] moderately notice how Joel says it
[1:18:21] moderately so it was not a delou it was
[1:18:25] not a
[1:18:26] flood but how did the former Reigns come
[1:18:29] now remember it's the land of Israel and
[1:18:31] many of the Nations around the earth
[1:18:33] parts of Africa we know are the exact
[1:18:35] same way also some of the Asiatic places
[1:18:39] exactly the same way so they will get
[1:18:42] the former rings and then they will get
[1:18:44] what they call the
[1:18:45] monsoons and the monsoons is what will
[1:18:48] produce the crop so it will come
[1:18:50] moderately it will break up the soil
[1:18:53] make the soil compatible to receive seed
[1:18:56] then the farmers go along behind in the
[1:18:58] so seed it'll get a little bit of a
[1:19:00] zooza over here and a little zooza over
[1:19:03] here and they'll have a little bit of an
[1:19:04] outbreak of a Revival over there and
[1:19:06] another outbreak but they're want more
[1:19:09] than that they thank God for that I
[1:19:11] don't know about you I thank God for
[1:19:12] every little Revival we can have up here
[1:19:15] and there but I'm looking for the
[1:19:17] lighter rain to come and the lighter
[1:19:19] rain I'm looking for is not everybody in
[1:19:22] the message rallying around one preacher
[1:19:25] or one church it's actually everybody in
[1:19:28] the message is Call Of God rattling
[1:19:30] around the Lord Jesus in the
[1:19:33] resurrection now watch let us go to
[1:19:36] spoken words original see whenever the
[1:19:38] prophet preaches this and if you haven't
[1:19:39] heard it be good for you to go back and
[1:19:41] listen to it it ain't but about 6 hours
[1:19:42] and 5 minutes or something I catch
[1:19:44] whenever you get plenty of time now what
[1:19:46] we're trying to do they're trying to
[1:19:50] manufacture a latter
[1:19:52] rain nonsense
[1:19:56] while the louter rain will sweep the
[1:19:58] world brother notice how he puts it in
[1:20:01] the future
[1:20:04] will and then a farmer rain sewing word
[1:20:07] right now you see what the latter rain
[1:20:10] produces you'll find out there being an
[1:20:14] affiliation now watch what the latter
[1:20:16] rain will produce for The ecumenical and
[1:20:19] the Pentecostals the Pentecostals and
[1:20:22] all the groups will come
[1:20:26] together and they'll shut the
[1:20:28] doors on them guys that won't listen to
[1:20:33] it so that's the spirit even among and
[1:20:36] around this message that wants to shut
[1:20:39] down people from having
[1:20:41] church it's not the spirit of God it's
[1:20:45] the spirit of
[1:20:47] antichrist well praise the Lord praise
[1:20:51] the Lord it don't take many quotes but
[1:20:53] I'll just give you one or two God's
[1:20:54] Prophet said in Christ The Mystery of
[1:20:56] God reveal of God is in your heart you
[1:20:59] can't wait till them doors back there
[1:21:01] open up to be able to get into the house
[1:21:03] of God to fellowship with your brothers
[1:21:06] and sisters he said God goes to
[1:21:11] church 1964 he tells the new converts
[1:21:15] there in his meeting now find you a home
[1:21:18] Church cause without a church home you
[1:21:21] will die spiritually
[1:21:27] that's I find that amazing because
[1:21:28] that's what I hear when I press play
[1:21:32] wow now watch so already now this is
[1:21:36] 1962 already har they were trying to
[1:21:40] manufacture a lad
[1:21:43] rain now you don't know how hard that is
[1:21:47] even now for me and Harry and brother
[1:21:50] Larry and different ones that used our
[1:21:53] gift
[1:21:55] in
[1:21:58] manufacturing under
[1:22:01] Pentecost cuz God gifts you and gives
[1:22:03] you the ability to play music and to
[1:22:06] sing and then you use that to get the
[1:22:09] people going and going and shouting and
[1:22:12] jumping and running that's
[1:22:16] right you don't know how it feels when
[1:22:18] you come to the
[1:22:20] truth and then you become washed and you
[1:22:23] look back at what you use your god-given
[1:22:26] gift
[1:22:27] for let me just tell you how it makes
[1:22:29] you feel it makes you feel like you
[1:22:32] prostituted your
[1:22:34] gift and then whenever you go to playing
[1:22:37] for God in the real light of the
[1:22:39] word it's like this line before you that
[1:22:43] you never want to cross over you you
[1:22:45] you're walking this tight rope and oh
[1:22:47] God God please God please help us help
[1:22:51] us that we don't prostitute help us Lord
[1:22:53] that we don't try to build your people
[1:22:55] up with music and make them emotional
[1:22:58] you know I love music you know I believe
[1:23:01] in singing and D dancing and shouting
[1:23:04] but let me tell you one thing the
[1:23:06] prophet of God said that whenever you
[1:23:08] get to a place that you think you've got
[1:23:11] to shout and you've got to dance you
[1:23:13] haven't been to church or you're afraid
[1:23:15] what your neighbor will think about you
[1:23:17] you are drinking from a stagnated
[1:23:22] sister people think a f form is only
[1:23:26] somebody sitting there not moving their
[1:23:28] arms oh no that's only one kind of form
[1:23:31] there's another kind of form that does
[1:23:33] this every service and as soon as the
[1:23:36] music slows down everybody stops
[1:23:41] dancing well in the same quote the
[1:23:44] prophet said you don't need the music to
[1:23:46] dance he said as a matter of fact if
[1:23:48] they're playing near my God to thee
[1:23:51] you'll keep right on dancing and right
[1:23:53] on SHO but a lot of folks dance as long
[1:23:56] as the music's going wide open and when
[1:23:59] the Music Stops they St then when the
[1:24:01] music starts they start what are you
[1:24:03] doing operated by a juke box somebody
[1:24:06] drops a nickel down in you or a quarter
[1:24:09] down in you and it turns your shout on
[1:24:12] and your shout off Oh Glory to God I
[1:24:15] want our church to be able to shout if
[1:24:18] the music is slow if the me music is
[1:24:22] mediocre if the music is fast because
[1:24:25] the shout ought to be inside of your
[1:24:28] soul not regulated by the organ player
[1:24:32] not regulated by the drummer or the
[1:24:34] piano player but the Holy Ghost bubbling
[1:24:38] up inside of
[1:24:40] [Applause]
[1:24:52] you I was trying to make sure I didn't
[1:24:54] that
[1:24:58] gunpowder now friends I have a
[1:25:01] problem whether it's Pentecostals or
[1:25:04] message trying to manufacture letter
[1:25:08] ring cuz ain't none of us got no
[1:25:12] manufacturing machine for latter rain we
[1:25:15] can manufacture motion we can manufactur
[1:25:19] movement and all that sort of St oh you

[1:25:23] bride mov manal life we got shouting and
[1:25:25] dancing and running in our church we're
[1:25:27] only one of the very few churches that
[1:25:28] have it all you got to do is go to
[1:25:31] YouTube you top in Pentecostal shoting
[1:25:34] and Pentecostal dancing you'll find all
[1:25:36] kinds of them you'll find even some
[1:25:39] Baptists that are still out there old
[1:25:41] southern baptist that's shouting and
[1:25:43] dancing well come on somebody they're
[1:25:45] running they're jumping they're shouting
[1:25:47] they're having prayer lines people are
[1:25:49] getting healed so if that's a bride's
[1:25:51] Revival then that means they've got it
[1:25:56] woo the latter rain is not just healing
[1:26:00] the latter rain is not just Miracles but
[1:26:04] this latter rain is going to be former
[1:26:07] teaching and latter what is it watering
[1:26:10] the word it will anoint the word and yes
[1:26:15] there will be Miracles yes the dead will
[1:26:18] be raised

[1:26:26] folks rais in our
[1:26:30] church the prophet said that there' be A
[1:26:32] Time coming missing
[1:26:35] limbs would be
[1:26:38] restored but we want the rain to fall on
[1:26:42] pure word seed not on hybridized
[1:26:46] stuff and you know what's the most
[1:26:48] deceiving thing you and I was going to
[1:26:50] face in the last
[1:26:53] days
[1:26:54] message
[1:26:56] hybridized with
[1:26:58] Pentecost our message hybridized with
[1:27:02] Baptist cuz everybody in the message
[1:27:04] don't like
[1:27:06] movement they're more Cemetery type
[1:27:10] people true brother icicle in the pullit
[1:27:15] ice cubes in the
[1:27:18] pews and then our little children are
[1:27:20] ice

[1:27:35] don't want no ice cubes in our church I
[1:27:38] don't want our young people to be little
[1:27:40] bitty ice cubes well Glory I love it to
[1:27:43] see our front rows up here fill with
[1:27:45] young people I don't understand why in
[1:27:47] the world these front rows ain't full of
[1:27:49] people what the world's matter to y'all

[1:27:58] fire what in the world have you found
[1:28:00] back there that ain't up here and more
[1:28:02] of it I don't understand why in the
[1:28:04] world you ought to be fighting for the
[1:28:06] first front row s it up here or you say
[1:28:09] you spit my face well that won't hurt
[1:28:10] you you can wipe it
[1:28:15] off Oh Glory to God we don't want an
[1:28:20] icicle in the Pulpit we don't want ice
[1:28:22] skids in the p you we want people on
[1:28:26] fire with the baptism of the Holy
[1:28:28] [Applause]
[1:28:37] Ghost my
[1:28:46] goodness I know that that packet this
[1:28:48] morning that I opened said
[1:28:51] unfrosted strawberry poptart
[1:28:55] I know it did not say Locust and Wild
[1:29:00] Honey now you'll see what the latter
[1:29:02] rain produces and you'll find out there
[1:29:04] be an
[1:29:05] affiliation the Pentecostals and the
[1:29:07] groups will come together and they'll
[1:29:10] shut the door on them guys that won't
[1:29:12] listen to it you won't even be able
[1:29:15] allowed
[1:29:16] Lotus to open your
[1:29:20] mouth so what spirit is it hanging
[1:29:23] around the message message then that
[1:29:25] don't want preachers to open their
[1:29:30] mouth it ain't from the
[1:29:33] Bible it's from
[1:29:36] Hell well go ahead brother
[1:29:40] Donnie I notice when this
[1:29:44] comes
[1:29:45] listen that's
[1:29:48] when he'll
[1:29:51] come that's when he'll show
[1:29:55] that's when you'll see a
[1:29:57] rain oh my they still be quiet Let It Go
[1:30:03] the Hebrew word Mor now Mor means
[1:30:06] teaching in other
[1:30:09] words it'll be a teaching rain and a
[1:30:12] harvest rain so do we stop teaching then
[1:30:17] when the latter rain
[1:30:19] comes can't you see why God loves a
[1:30:22] balanced preacher
[1:30:24] yeah you most time you have got one or
[1:30:26] one you know one on one side one on the
[1:30:27] other side of the ditch I get so sick of
[1:30:29] cleaning out ditches anybody understand
[1:30:32] what I'm saying when I was in Pentecost
[1:30:33] man I lived in the ditch I went down
[1:30:36] through the ditch I mean I cleaned out
[1:30:37] ditches I was upside one side down the
[1:30:39] ditch and down the other whenever I come
[1:30:41] out of there I was so scared of
[1:30:42] Pentecost I was scared of God even
[1:30:44] speaking to him anymore and I went out
[1:30:45] of a Pentecostal dish over into a
[1:30:47] message ditch but this is the mystery
[1:30:49] part about it have you ever met anybody
[1:30:51] that thought that wasn't in the middle
[1:30:52] of the road
[1:30:54] everybody you talk to thinks they in the
[1:30:56] middle of the road every Pastor believes
[1:30:58] his church is right in the middle of the
[1:31:00] road every preacher thinks he's in the
[1:31:02] middle of the road well either I don't
[1:31:04] understand what the middle of the road
[1:31:05] is or this is a wide Road I I we got a
[1:31:08] problem somewhere everybody cannot be in
[1:31:10] the middle of the road we've got
[1:31:12] everything in the world in and around
[1:31:14] this message but I'm here to encourage
[1:31:17] you tonight and let you know there is
[1:31:19] true seed there are true Christians
[1:31:22] there are true believers
[1:31:24] and it's going to produce the lighter
[1:31:31] rain it yes sir it'll be a teaching
[1:31:36] rain don't you understand it ain't want
[1:31:38] to be Miracles ever
[1:31:43] night it's amazing to me that some of
[1:31:45] the brothers in the message it's all
[1:31:47] they ever preach Deliverance Miracles
[1:31:49] healing Miracles Deliverance healing
[1:31:51] Miracles Deliverance every service
[1:31:53] necess a l of rain no my brother
[1:31:58] no Moray still comes with it why cuz
[1:32:03] there might be one here tonight or five
[1:32:05] or three or four that ain't in yet they
[1:32:08] still need a preacher that'll sell that
[1:32:10] word inside of the heart they might be
[1:32:12] the last quickening to go away come on
[1:32:14] children oh yes we believe in that
[1:32:16] Supernatural but we don't stop sewing

[1:32:23] at our church
[1:32:24] well while we're enjoying the Miracles
[1:32:26] and the signs and the Wonders I'm hoping
[1:32:28] there be somebody here tonight get
[1:32:30] filled with the Holy Ghost they're not
[1:32:32] be somebody here that not get delivered
[1:32:34] from some old church enti
[1:32:36] [Applause]
[1:32:38] Spirit look this is the balance of it
[1:32:40] brother Nathan quoted here on Sunday
[1:32:42] Proverbs 11:1 always been one of my
[1:32:44] favorite scriptures I quote it like
[1:32:45] crazy in Pentecost I didn't understand
[1:32:47] it a false balance is an abomination in
[1:32:49] the eyes of the Lord but it just Waites
[1:32:51] his Delight look what the latter rings
[1:32:53] going to be some say all the latter in
[1:32:55] his sister Mysteries it's just the
[1:32:57] teaching the other say oh no no no we're
[1:32:59] getting away from all that teaching say
[1:33:01] well brother R said this brother R said
[1:33:03] that we don't need that no more we're
[1:33:05] moving beyond well you go ahead and move
[1:33:07] all you want to we're staying right
[1:33:10] here but there's got to be people
[1:33:13] somewhere who will say wait a minute
[1:33:15] wait a minute didn't he say it would be
[1:33:17] former teaching and
[1:33:20] latter together
[1:33:26] praise
[1:33:28] God oh now we've had the teaching rain
[1:33:32] I'm we ready for the Harvest rain you
[1:33:35] know the first rain is when you plant
[1:33:37] the seed start your crop growing then
[1:33:41] just before it
[1:33:44] matures there comes another crop that's
[1:33:47] one they'll call the Harvest
[1:33:50] rain now when it's the spring rain
[1:33:54] and the rains about
[1:33:57] June it makes your
[1:34:00] crop now remember he's quoting
[1:34:04] seasonally according to the seasons here
[1:34:08] not in Israel because theirs were not in
[1:34:11] June but he's quoting what he's familiar
[1:34:14] with
[1:34:17] here oh
[1:34:19] my we're at the end time the sea are SE
[1:34:25] now the latter rain is fixing to come
[1:34:30] forth remember there will come such a
[1:34:34] denominational Gathering pretty
[1:34:37] soon it'll be
[1:34:42] terrific
[1:34:46] wow a denominational Gathering and it'll
[1:34:50] be terrific and they will bring
[1:34:52] themselves together into this Federation
[1:34:54] of churches then this kind of a church
[1:34:57] will be put out of
[1:34:59] operation I love these words in
[1:35:02] parenthesis as far as they
[1:35:07] know other have shut down our church
[1:35:10] they may shut her down but we can have
[1:35:11] church in your basement my basement your
[1:35:13] basement and your basement they may take
[1:35:15] our building away from us but they will
[1:35:17] never shut us up they will never shut us
[1:35:20] down well Hallelujah somebody it may th
[1:35:24] us down because we may find out
[1:35:26] everybody that was Among Us didn't
[1:35:27] really believe it know how but that's
[1:35:29] when the real true seedle put forth
[1:35:32] everything they're supposed to
[1:35:34] [Applause]
[1:35:36] produce oh
[1:35:38] my it's at that
[1:35:41] time that
[1:35:43] Jesus will
[1:35:46] appear and he will
[1:35:49] show which is bride yes sir and which is
[1:35:54] not my friends this is The
[1:35:59] Showdown The Showdown will be those who
[1:36:02] are
[1:36:03] bride and those who aren't yes sir and
[1:36:06] it ties into the personage of the Lord
[1:36:09] Jesus himself amen so the fullness of
[1:36:14] the latter rain will never be climaxed
[1:36:17] in my
[1:36:18] Ministry in mother Daryl's Ministry or
[1:36:21] any other message preacher
[1:36:24] it would be climaxed in the appearing of
[1:36:28] our Lord Jesus so when preachers go to
[1:36:31] pulling you toward them you know right
[1:36:34] there sign of a false
[1:36:36] one if he really understands the word
[1:36:40] he's going to say I'm only a channel I'm
[1:36:43] only a way that God can speak to you but
[1:36:45] the one we're pointing you to is right
[1:36:46] up here of the Lord Jesus right up here
[1:36:49] look at all these message clicks and
[1:36:51] Cults and clams have been and they
[1:36:53] pointed you to a certain city somewhere
[1:36:56] where this certain man got this great
[1:36:58] Revelation about this or that or the
[1:37:00] other and out of there come their little
[1:37:02] boys and they go to preaching the same
[1:37:04] thing and then they go to Conquering the
[1:37:06] world with all their Doctrine and if you
[1:37:08] don't believe what they believe then
[1:37:10] you're out every one of them goes back
[1:37:12] to a man somewhere but this latter name
[1:37:16] don't point to a man it points to God it
[1:37:20] don't point to New York City it don't
[1:37:23] point to Jeffersonville it don't point
[1:37:25] to Johnson City it points to Heaven Oh
[1:37:28] Glory to God it didn't start with man it
[1:37:31] won't end up with
[1:37:37] man look at Oral Roberts and the
[1:37:40] Pentecostals there's been a teaching
[1:37:43] rain gone
[1:37:44] forth now notice where we are right
[1:37:47] now we've got the Benny hens we've got
[1:37:50] all the television preachers and all the
[1:37:53] prophets that's on YouTube and all the
[1:37:56] prophets that's on TV you know we've
[1:37:58] even got men that are quoting brother
[1:38:00] brandom one of the brothers at the
[1:38:01] church s me one the other day of a man
[1:38:04] saying that brother brandham you know
[1:38:05] prophesied that there'd be a woman
[1:38:07] president and he's trying to say of
[1:38:09] course to this Cala Harris and he said
[1:38:11] you know that that this Prophet
[1:38:13] prophesied about it and wrote it on a
[1:38:14] yell a piece of paper and so on and so
[1:38:16] on and you think well that's that's well
[1:38:19] and good but that ain't exactly what he
[1:38:21] said he said that it could have been the
[1:38:23] Catholic church or it could have been a
[1:38:24] woman present hey you what they're going
[1:38:26] to do if they're going to make brother
[1:38:28] brandom say that and if she don't get it
[1:38:30] then who's going to look bad not them
[1:38:32] they're going to blame brother Brandon
[1:38:33] for it why because they misapplied what
[1:38:36] he said I find it amazing they pick the
[1:38:39] things they want I pick the things I
[1:38:41] don't
[1:38:42] like uhhuh well there's things about
[1:38:45] this message it's hard to swallow
[1:38:47] there's things about this message that
[1:38:49] burns me up well come on somebody
[1:38:52] there's things about this message
[1:38:54] that'll make you pout there's things
[1:38:56] about this message that'll make you cry
[1:38:58] there's things about this message
[1:39:00] that'll burn your heart and turn you
[1:39:02] every Way but Loose but when you get
[1:39:05] done it turns you every way and
[1:39:09] loose because we don't pick just what we
[1:39:12] want we want what we need God give me a
[1:39:16] spank and God give me a woman but give
[1:39:19] me whatever I need to get ready to leave
[1:39:22] this world
[1:39:31] woo glory to
[1:39:35] God look at or Roberts the pentecostes
[1:39:39] have been a teaching Reign a national
[1:39:41] teaching
[1:39:44] Reign
[1:39:48] communism
[1:39:50] wow a national teaching rain wow
[1:39:56] communism but you see As Americans we
[1:40:00] listen to our politicians talk and we
[1:40:03] don't even know that beneath their fine
[1:40:06] fancy
[1:40:07] words is
[1:40:09] principles of
[1:40:12] Communism well we have everything in
[1:40:15] common and the poor illiterate average
[1:40:18] person that don't even know oh we're
[1:40:20] going to take away from the rich we're
[1:40:22] going to take away from the rich and
[1:40:24] we're going to spread it Out Among the
[1:40:26] poor people
[1:40:29] communism we're going to control grocery
[1:40:32] store
[1:40:34] prices
[1:40:36] communism I've been in communist
[1:40:39] countries around the world friends and
[1:40:40] talk to people who live under it and
[1:40:42] whenever you live under it it's a whole
[1:40:44] lot different than what Tim Walls would
[1:40:47] like to tell you as a matter of fact I
[1:40:50] heard him say the other day that
[1:40:51] communist China had some real principles
[1:40:54] that we in America could really love and
[1:40:57] dumb American people would vote for such
[1:41:00] a thing well brother Donnie you ain't
[1:41:02] supposed to preach politics I'm supposed
[1:41:04] to preach the
[1:41:11] truth why years ago the American people
[1:41:14] would have grabbed that man by the ear
[1:41:16] and throw him into the Atlantic and sunk
[1:41:18] it they would have grabbed a lot of
[1:41:20] these politicians and sent them in a
[1:41:22] slow boat to China they would have never
[1:41:25] stood for it but now they swallow it
[1:41:27] right down Hook Line and Seeker why
[1:41:31] seeds of
[1:41:33] Communism and now it's coming up in the
[1:41:36] average United States
[1:41:39] citizens
[1:41:41] heart
[1:41:42] it well that makes a lot of sense to me
[1:41:45] I'm a poor person I don't think it's
[1:41:48] fair for these old sorry stinking rich
[1:41:51] people take it away from them take it
[1:41:54] away from them give it to all the rest
[1:41:56] of us that's the way it ought to be do
[1:41:58] away with
[1:42:00] capitalism uhhuh you're under that same
[1:42:02] communistic Spirit ain't
[1:42:07] you remember the the disciples tried
[1:42:10] that for a little while in the book of
[1:42:11] Acts they didn't make it work
[1:42:17] either sting burn
[1:42:20] ouch Scorch come on
[1:42:25] there will be one person who can make
[1:42:29] everything in common
[1:42:35] work not Putin not Harrison walls not
[1:42:39] Trump nobody
[1:42:44] else how in the world did I get off on
[1:42:46] that brother Jack did you need that I
[1:42:48] guess you did sitting there you needed
[1:42:51] that my
[1:42:54] there's been a national teaching rign
[1:42:57] communism sold amongst the
[1:42:59] people every nation you so
[1:43:03] denominational seed when the Holy Ghost
[1:43:06] fell it made a
[1:43:09] denominational
[1:43:13] Revival you see this is where we
[1:43:16] are if we're not
[1:43:18] careful the hibid seeds of message plus
[1:43:23] usza Street
[1:43:26] Pentecost merged together that was sown
[1:43:30] Years Ago by some of the
[1:43:32] preachers when the rain falls on it
[1:43:34] it'll come
[1:43:36] forth boy it will be man it'll be
[1:43:39] considered
[1:43:41] life yeah it'll be considered a church
[1:43:43] is
[1:43:45] alive they'll even the DAP sayings like
[1:43:48] a church alive is worth the drive
[1:43:57] real poetic
[1:43:59] right well I'm sorry your pastor is not
[1:44:02] much of a
[1:44:04] poet I'm more of a fire and brimstone
[1:44:10] guy I ain't interested in my words
[1:44:13] rhyming I ain't interested in tickling
[1:44:15] your ear I want your soul to be so full
[1:44:18] of the Holy Ghost you can look lost in
[1:44:21] the face you can look in the face you
[1:44:24] can look death in the face and say back
[1:44:26] off death back off cancer back off TB
[1:44:30] you don't make me
[1:44:31] [Applause]
[1:44:37] afraid oh
[1:44:40] my oh goodness
[1:44:43] friends this is where we will have to be
[1:44:46] so
[1:44:47] close oh I hear him
[1:44:50] say listen little church
[1:44:54] the church in the last days will be
[1:44:58] twins same
[1:45:00] movement same
[1:45:02] mother but different
[1:45:05] fathers it will be a Pentecostal
[1:45:09] move and it will be so close it would
[1:45:12] deceive the very
[1:45:14] elected if it were
[1:45:19] possible don't think it's just
[1:45:21] restricted to Africa
[1:45:24] there's a man right now in Africa that
[1:45:26] has this ministry
[1:45:29] so-called the dead are being raised the
[1:45:31] sick are being healed all kinds of
[1:45:34] things are happening phenomenal Miracles
[1:45:37] Gathering thousands and thousands
[1:45:39] seemingly started off really really good
[1:45:42] preaching the message supposedly going
[1:45:45] fine seemed like for ever so long but
[1:45:48] something
[1:45:49] changed brother Tim showed me a clip of
[1:45:52] it the other day we were together and
[1:45:54] now when the man comes into church the
[1:45:57] people are bowing before him worshiping
[1:46:00] him breaking off
[1:46:03] branches and throwing in his
[1:46:06] paths calling him
[1:46:09] Elohim around the ranks of our
[1:46:13] message seeds were sown for such a
[1:46:20] thing oh my goodness
[1:46:23] so that seed was sown years
[1:46:26] ago oh
[1:46:28] yeah and it's got to produce a crop and
[1:46:31] where would it produce itself Among
[1:46:35] Us among
[1:46:37] us but watch what it will do you see
[1:46:40] Pentecost never receive their messenger
[1:46:44] I hope you understand this that the
[1:46:45] church A's messenger comes at the end of
[1:46:48] the
[1:46:49] age so God actually sent lucier at the
[1:46:52] end of the C age sent West at the end of
[1:46:54] the Lutheran age on down on down and God
[1:46:56] sends brother Brandon at the end of the
[1:47:00] Pentecostal
[1:47:02] age but they
[1:47:04] refused Elijah's meal
[1:47:09] offering so Pentecost had poison in the
[1:47:14] pot remember that in the Old Testament
[1:47:17] that they went out and gathered herbs
[1:47:19] and they didn't realize what this
[1:47:21] Gathering
[1:47:23] and whenever they cooked them all up at
[1:47:25] the assemblies and you know the Church
[1:47:26] of God and all that stuff and they they
[1:47:28] cooked it all up and then they looked
[1:47:29] down at the pot and they said oh there's
[1:47:32] death in the pot there's death in the
[1:47:35] pot so what did they do they call for
[1:47:39] Elisha to come over what did he do he
[1:47:42] got some
[1:47:43] meal now the meal of course represented
[1:47:46] Christ and the birds had to be cut a
[1:47:48] certain way and then they would grind
[1:47:50] the corn and every little bit of that
[1:47:52] would come out out ground the same
[1:47:53] yesterday and forever and then Elisha
[1:47:55] spread it across the pot and it brought
[1:47:59] healing to the pot now he said eat it it
[1:48:02] won't kill you now what did Pentecost do
[1:48:06] they refused Elijah's meal
[1:48:09] offering in their pot of the
[1:48:13] godhead so Elijah throw in the meal that
[1:48:17] it was not three Gods but it was one God
[1:48:20] in three offices but they didn't want
[1:48:23] the meal in the off in the in the pot so
[1:48:26] he also said for us about the gifts I
[1:48:29] want you to notice and you'll be able to
[1:48:31] tell even around our message if it's a
[1:48:35] true spirit of God operating gifts and
[1:48:38] it's acts two gifts or if it's a zeusa
[1:48:42] street gifts because Pentecost
[1:48:47] refused Elijah's meal offering in their
[1:48:52] seething hot of
[1:48:55] gifts now if you think that brother
[1:48:57] brandham only preached gifts at the
[1:48:59] brandom Tabernacle you need to do a
[1:49:01] little broader search he preached It All
[1:49:04] Over America cuz he wasn't just sent to
[1:49:07] Brandon Tabernacle he was sent to try to
[1:49:11] correct
[1:49:13] Pentecost don't you understand in his
[1:49:16] ministry is two great
[1:49:19] advents William Brandon was sent as a
[1:49:22] messenger to to the leoan
[1:49:24] church but God is going to use his
[1:49:27] ministry I hope it don't blow you away
[1:49:29] but this is why he could say in shreport
[1:49:31] in
[1:49:32] 1965 the Elijah of this day is the Lord
[1:49:38] Jesus
[1:49:43] Christ now you see for the carnal-minded
[1:49:45] people they want to make that him
[1:49:48] no he was the messenger to the Le ofan
[1:49:51] Church Christ come to call a bride
[1:49:56] age but it was revealed through the
[1:49:59] ministry of the prophet of Malachi 4 Bo
[1:50:01] some of y'all are big ey of me tonight
[1:50:03] y'all must eat Pepper for
[1:50:05] supper but look what God did unlike any
[1:50:09] other age he brought this man and he
[1:50:12] kept pouring it in there and he poured
[1:50:14] in the seething pot of emotion they
[1:50:16] wouldn't have
[1:50:17] it he poured it in there about the gifts
[1:50:20] and said these gifts need to be operated
[1:50:22] such and such a way they wouldn't have
[1:50:24] oh we're not having we're not giving up
[1:50:26] our freedom quench the spirit of God and
[1:50:29] you know what breaks my
[1:50:31] heart is you see that same attitude
[1:50:34] happening right around the message right
[1:50:36] now oh we got freedom in our church
[1:50:39] we're not going that way so then that
[1:50:42] makes some of our message people
[1:50:44] refusing Elijah's meal offering in their
[1:50:50] pot which means their inspiration is not
[1:50:54] the original acts
[1:50:57] two it's Aza street
[1:51:04] again did the air conditioner shut off
[1:51:06] brother William you need to check that
[1:51:08] thing man it's hot in the firecracker in
[1:51:09] here tonight A man I
[1:51:12] li now come on friends we got this
[1:51:15] message we wanted as a
[1:51:17] cafeteria we want to study hundreds and
[1:51:19] hundreds of quotes and prove we're
[1:51:21] supposed to have gifts and Deni them
[1:51:23] others where he tells us how to use
[1:51:26] them and we refuse Elijah's meal
[1:51:32] offering but Brother D if we put them in
[1:51:34] the back room what are we going to have
[1:51:36] we're going to have them right that's
[1:51:39] what we're going to have
[1:51:41] right or we're going to have a repeat of
[1:51:45] ausa
[1:51:47] Street and remember I'm sowing seeds
[1:51:51] every Pastor sewing seeds in this
[1:51:53] message every preacher is sewing seeds
[1:51:56] and if there's another five years
[1:51:58] another 10 those seeds will start coming
[1:52:00] up so we are sewing a hybrid message and
[1:52:05] a Susa
[1:52:07] Street what will it
[1:52:15] produce let's
[1:52:18] stand woo
[1:52:31] listen this what we need is get back to
[1:52:33] the word get back to the real word of
[1:52:35] God and bring forth a bride to Christ
[1:52:40] and the word true back to the word how
[1:52:43] can you plant wheat here and wheat here
[1:52:48] and say I'm going to get cucumbers here
[1:52:51] and wheat
[1:52:53] here yes you can't do it the only way
[1:52:56] you're going to get
[1:52:58] cucumbers I mean this is deep right man
[1:53:01] don't you love this deep theology
[1:53:03] wow the only way you're going to get
[1:53:06] cucumbers is plant
[1:53:11] cucumbers there's only one
[1:53:13] way we're going to produce a Rapture
[1:53:16] only one way we're going to produce a
[1:53:18] virgin
[1:53:20] bread so that word in
[1:53:23] so that
[1:53:27] word I wonder what all the churches will
[1:53:30] have around the world on all the
[1:53:32] preachers that we have how many
[1:53:36] really are pure seed
[1:53:41] preachers that are actually
[1:53:45] Unix you see that's what they would do
[1:53:47] when a king would have a
[1:53:51] Harum he wanted wanted men there to
[1:53:53] watch over the Queen the wives his
[1:53:57] Herm but he did not want men capable of
[1:54:01] fathering
[1:54:03] children so they would get Unix and if
[1:54:05] they weren't Unix they would make Unix
[1:54:08] out of
[1:54:11] them that way they could have the
[1:54:13] strength of a man the courage of a man
[1:54:17] the ability to War as a man because a
[1:54:20] man thinks different than a woman we
[1:54:21] know that yeah but you don't want that
[1:54:25] man with the ability to Father his own
[1:54:29] children under the roof of the King's
[1:54:36] Castle so he would make them
[1:54:42] unic oh
[1:54:45] alas down to the years how many
[1:54:47] preachers have come and
[1:54:49] gone many of them started out saying
[1:54:52] they
[1:54:53] unics it didn't take
[1:54:55] long till they started raising up people
[1:54:58] in their church that look just like them
[1:55:00] that's
[1:55:02] right believe it or not I know some
[1:55:04] message preachers that that's so
[1:55:07] naturally
[1:55:11] uhhuh so they get the preacher Spirit
[1:55:13] why he's their
[1:55:16] father and that's why you can show them
[1:55:18] look God's Prophet said this but your
[1:55:20] pastor saying so and so well I don't
[1:55:22] care I'm going to stay with him well I
[1:55:24] guess you should cuz he's your
[1:55:27] daddy so if he goes to hell go on with
[1:55:31] it but if your father is the
[1:55:34] word then if Donnie Reagan darl Ward
[1:55:39] Jackie Benton whoever leaves the word
[1:55:42] you'll leave them before you'll leave
[1:55:44] Christ
[1:55:47] Jesus is that right
[1:55:49] Saints you see it's that type of
[1:55:52] people when them Galatians come in there
[1:55:55] and Paul old brother BR talks about in
[1:55:56] the church age book and he said Paul
[1:55:58] when he talked about them saints when
[1:56:00] even in the Book of Revelation he said
[1:56:02] you have tried them which say they are
[1:56:05] Apostles and are not you have found them
[1:56:11] Liars he said oh my that sets my soul on
[1:56:15] fire who are they to try these people
[1:56:18] who call themselves Apostles he said
[1:56:21] they tried them by the the word and they
[1:56:23] were not saying what Paul said and
[1:56:26] remember these weren't Bishops and
[1:56:27] deacons and trustees it was the saints
[1:56:30] of
[1:56:31] God I mentioned it to you before if the
[1:56:34] saints of God would refuse to give ear
[1:56:37] to false teachers that'd be no need for
[1:56:40] them but it's based upon supply and
[1:56:43] demand some preachers can preach Humpty
[1:56:46] Dumpty as God and some people would
[1:56:48] follow him I know you're laughing at
[1:56:50] that you think it's crazy if You' been
[1:56:52] believe some of the stuff I've heard
[1:56:54] that message preachers and preach some
[1:56:56] of them that used to be with
[1:56:58] us some of the utter complete
[1:57:02] nonsense you realize when you walk away
[1:57:04] from
[1:57:05] truths you're successible to
[1:57:10] anything look friends as your friend as
[1:57:12] your brother as your pastor I'm telling
[1:57:15] you tonight run with all of your soul
[1:57:18] into this word not me
[1:57:22] not so much our church not after this
[1:57:24] man that man but make sure the
[1:57:27] word is your
[1:57:32] father that's the type of
[1:57:35] material when carolly and I stood
[1:57:37] several years
[1:57:38] ago at the Roman
[1:57:42] Coliseum still there in
[1:57:45] Rome and you walk inside of there and
[1:57:47] you look
[1:57:49] around you can't keep from tears coming
[1:57:51] out of your eyes and sadness filling
[1:57:53] your heart as you think how many of our
[1:57:56] brothers and sisters were fed the lines
[1:57:59] were cutting shreds by
[1:58:02] gladiators but they were willing to do
[1:58:06] it then we went to the
[1:58:09] catacombs which is nothing but Solid
[1:58:11] Rock soft top rock I forget the Strat of
[1:58:14] the name of it there in Italy but the
[1:58:16] graves are not built like you would
[1:58:18] think but they're built back like this
[1:58:20] so they go in and cut them out a solid
[1:58:22] rock and have a space in between just
[1:58:24] have them ried in there like that but it
[1:58:27] was a safe place for the Saints to have
[1:58:31] church too bad they didn't understand
[1:58:33] that you could be able to be a secret
[1:58:35] believer and not really have to go to
[1:58:36] church like some of the folks do today
[1:58:38] stay home and play
[1:58:39] tapes nobody knows you're a Believer
[1:58:42] nobody knows you know you just kind of
[1:58:44] keep it everything to yourself and you
[1:58:46] don't let your light so shine before men
[1:58:48] and all that sort of thing it's really
[1:58:49] sad to me that all those thousands of
[1:58:51] people lost their
[1:58:57] lives you mean God let them people give
[1:59:00] their lives and he's going to let us get
[1:59:02] by on such a lazy rotten
[1:59:06] scheme no he's
[1:59:09] not
[1:59:11] M that's the kind of Christian I want to
[1:59:14] be Brother Don you want to be a martyr
[1:59:17] nope I sure
[1:59:18] don't NOP I'm not going to lay my head
[1:59:22] right down here tonight say all right
[1:59:23] somebody come up here and cut it
[1:59:24] off but if God ordained me for such a
[1:59:27] purpose he'll give me strength to do it
[1:59:30] I'm showing him my strengths under the
[1:59:33] anointing of this age which is what a
[1:59:36] flying
[1:59:40] eagle and the Eagles don't sit around
[1:59:43] with a butter knife eating croissant
[1:59:47] rolls they don't sit around eating
[1:59:49] cinnamon buns and sitting around with
[1:59:51] their little cloth and the little dainty
[1:59:53] napkins wiping icing off of their mouths
[1:59:58] they reach down and grab a hold to that
[2:00:08] carcass and that Bloody word is all over
[2:00:12] their face all over their
[2:00:17] mouth I thought oh my
[2:00:20] God one day them Old Testament Saints
[2:00:23] will come
[2:00:25] forward they'll come out of the
[2:00:28] ground
[2:00:30] Hallelujah proudly
[2:00:33] displaying the blood of Jesus Christ the
[2:00:37] message of
[2:00:38] God for the hour they lived
[2:00:45] in wait till it hits
[2:00:48] friends you see Miracles alone ain't it
[2:00:51] cuz the Pentecost say are having them
[2:00:52] shouting jumping meetings Pentecostals
[2:00:55] are having
[2:00:56] them theology the Episcopal have that
[2:00:59] it'll be a mixture of both but it can't
[2:01:03] just be any word it's got to be the word
[2:01:06] for our
[2:01:07] season so if Elijah sprinkle meal on the
[2:01:10] gifts are you going to take the meal
[2:01:13] version or the seething pot
[2:01:16] version I had that version before and I
[2:01:19] ain't going back to that are we
[2:01:22] amen I figure some of you oldtimers that
[2:01:25] done seen it before y'all would just
[2:01:27] about cause a
[2:01:29] Revolt if I started bringing back the
[2:01:32] seething pot of
[2:01:36] 1906 we don't have to take
[2:01:38] that let Elijah sprinkle the meal of the
[2:01:42] anointed word on there and let's pull
[2:01:44] the gifts out
[2:01:47] perfect
[2:01:49] gifts instead of oh I feel there
[2:01:52] somebody here tonight oh oh it's over on
[2:01:55] this high for the
[2:02:01] church somebody over in this
[2:02:04] section has got a pain who
[2:02:11] ain't somebody's got a burden who
[2:02:16] ain't and call it
[2:02:19] discernment nonsense
[2:02:22] God's Prophet said there'll be one to an
[2:02:25] age come on
[2:02:27] children not a dozen
[2:02:32] what uhhuh you know what that was that
[2:02:35] just give you

[2:06:01] theology just because we've got
[2:06:03] scripture don't mean it's in line we can
[2:06:06] have scriptures and be
[2:06:08] misaligned because we miss the
[2:06:10] application of the meal of the end
[2:06:14] time we can take scriptures and put them
[2:06:17] together and can make the pot Seas
[2:06:22] because we've got it put together
[2:06:26] wrong your message did not come father
[2:06:29] to replace the Bible or replace the
[2:06:32] scriptures but to help our
[2:06:36] thinking as ministers to we be able to
[2:06:38] study under the mind of Christ to know
[2:06:42] what you want done with your
[2:06:44] word the season the time the allocation
[2:06:47] for the Age We Live help us Lord
[2:06:53] I wonder how many of you Saints tonight
[2:06:55] you say
[2:06:56] Lord that's the kind of bride I want to
[2:06:59] be I want that word in my heart if
[2:07:01] there's any hybrid Doctrine in me any
[2:07:04] hybrid seed in me
[2:07:06] Lord take it out tonight
[2:07:09] father Lord Jesus we raise our hands and
[2:07:13] I pray for them in a different way
[2:07:16] now may every man woman boy or girl
[2:07:19] every singer every musician every
[2:07:21] songwriter whatever we are father search
[2:07:25] my heart
[2:07:27] Jesus may my heart be a fertile
[2:07:31] ground by which the seed can
[2:07:36] grow I saw a striking image the other
[2:07:40] day and it was the shape of a human
[2:07:44] ear and someone had
[2:07:48] superimposed a a baby that was being
[2:07:50] formed
[2:07:52] in the mother's womb and said that the
[2:07:54] womb was
[2:07:55] shaped almost like a human
[2:07:58] ear and there was talking about the
[2:08:01] emphasis of how important is what we
[2:08:04] allow to our
[2:08:06] hearing because it's an inlet to our
[2:08:10] soul oh Lord God may we be careful who
[2:08:13] we listen
[2:08:14] to I ain't just on my charismatic
[2:08:16] preachers neither there's some message
[2:08:19] people we need to be careful who we
[2:08:21] listen to
[2:08:22] too father our ears become a
[2:08:27] Gateway an entrance into the bedding
[2:08:31] ground oh Lamb of
[2:08:33] God we want to bring forth the
[2:08:37] purity of this message oh there's been
[2:08:40] all kinds of messes and all this and
[2:08:42] that and the other of course the devil
[2:08:44] always does that but in spite of all
[2:08:46] that there'll be a virgin bride that'll
[2:08:49] be produced out of this message yes may
[2:08:52] part of them go from this assembly Lord
[2:08:55] God I believe I'll be part of it I
[2:08:59] believe with all of my heart I will but
[2:09:02] Lord let me say if there's anything in
[2:09:04] me tonight that displeases you show me
[2:09:08] help me to see it Lord I preached to too
[2:09:11] many
[2:09:13] people Lord to lead anyone as
[2:09:16] stray help me Lord Purge me wash me with
[2:09:23] hisp and I will be clean Lord
[2:09:27] God may I eat Elijah's
[2:09:32] treated
[2:09:34] porridge make Christ the meal offering
[2:09:38] be poured in my perception of
[2:09:40] election may it be poured in my
[2:09:43] perception of
[2:09:44] predestination it's evident some of the
[2:09:46] message people don't have Christ the
[2:09:49] meal offering in their IDE ology of
[2:09:52] predestination because they think
[2:09:53] they're predestinated can live any life
[2:09:55] they want to live they need Christ the
[2:09:57] meal offering and that seething pot of
[2:10:01] corruption it'll cleanse that
[2:10:04] pot oh Jesus pour it in our worship
[2:10:08] father pour Christ the meal offering in
[2:10:11] our worship then we won't come to church
[2:10:13] and stand here and never move and never
[2:10:16] raise our hands or never lift our voices
[2:10:19] neither will we be to the other side
[2:10:21] what we feel like if we don't shout over
[2:10:23] service we haven't had a meeting but
[2:10:25] it'll be balanced porridge a balanced
[2:10:29] diet because it will be the meal
[2:10:32] offering Christ that we'll pour into
[2:10:35] there to be able to get our
[2:10:37] emotions praise be to God and sink our

[2:11:56] sincere they L God they love the people
[2:11:59] and they were simply trying to help and
[2:12:02] trying to prepare a meal that they
[2:12:04] thought would be
[2:12:06] beneficial but little did they
[2:12:08] realized that got poisoned
[2:12:12] gourds maybe there's sincere preachers
