[0:00] [Music]
[0:04] Brother
[0:04] [Music]
[0:06] Mike, as far as the music, could you cut
[0:09] the
[0:11] music? All right, everyone. Can I have
[0:13] your attention,
[0:15] please? We have some very special
[0:17] honored guests with us tonight, and I
[0:20] want to tell you a little bit about each
[0:21] as you get your uh desserts and your
[0:23] mocha Joe's back to your tables.
[0:27] Many of you may
[0:28] know brother JD Witson and his wife
[0:31] Barbara. Would you please raise your
[0:33] hand so they can see you right in the
[0:35] middle? Brother JD and Barbara Witson
[0:37] have been part of Word of Life Church uh
[0:40] family since he was 13 years old and
[0:42] Barbara being seven. They were part of
[0:45] the original church Ran Hill Church of
[0:47] Jesus Christ in Johnson City.
[0:49] J D became a deacon in 1976 after the
[0:53] church moved and was renamed Happy
[0:56] Valley Church of Jesus Christ. JD is our
[0:59] head deacon has served these last 49
[1:02] years in this
[1:03] capacity. As head deacon, he's a great
[1:06] help to brother Donnie, I'm sure, as
[1:08] we've seen and uh and his church. We so
[1:10] love brother JD and Barbara and
[1:12] appreciate the sacrifice of love they've
[1:14] given to the Word of Life congregation.
[1:16] Please give them a round of applause.
[1:17] Brother JD Witson and his sister
[1:23] Barbara. I'm so relaxed now. I, you
[1:27] know, I was a little nervous starting
[1:28] out. We want to do so well for you and
[1:30] everybody's dressed up. I'm relaxed now.
[1:32] That steak was outstanding. I'm feeling
[1:34] better and it did my heart well to see
[1:36] all of you kind of break out of those
[1:38] little shells and talk to different
[1:40] people. I hope you enjoyed it. So, I
[1:42] want to continue with our honored guests
[1:44] now. And uh I can't believe it. Brother
[1:46] Louisie
[1:47] Blevens. Brother Louie uh and Sister
[1:50] Glenda be brother Louie began preaching
[1:52] and holding I didn't know this. Brother
[1:54] Louie began preaching and holding
[1:56] revival as a young man in high school.
[1:58] He traveled with his family singing and
[2:00] preaching. He and his wife Glenda came
[2:02] to Happy Valley in
[2:03] 1968 when the church services were still
[2:06] being held in the basement. Brother
[2:08] Louie became the primary song leader in
[2:11] 1989.
[2:12] He has faithfully served the last 36
[2:15] years as the church's song leader and is
[2:17] much loved here and throughout the
[2:19] message. He's the celebrity of the
[2:20] message. I think everybody loves Brother
[2:21] Louie. There will never be another Louis
[2:24] Blevens. And the church says, "Amen."
[2:27] And God bless our streamers, whoever
[2:29] might be streaming. Brother Louie, I
[2:32] love
[2:32] you. Please give it up one more time,
[2:34] Brother
[2:36] Louie. That's sister
[2:39] Glenda. Next. Next, we have I've had the
[2:43] honor of sitting at the table with
[2:44] brother Harvey and Sister Shirley
[2:46] Lungsford. Brother Harvey and Sister
[2:48] Shirley met in Prescott, Arizona at a
[2:50] Pentecostal church camp, which I just he
[2:52] started hearing a little about. While
[2:55] dating, they attended Brother Brandham's
[2:57] meetings and came out of the Pentecostal
[3:00] church and into the message. Once while
[3:02] dating, Brother Harvey got in trouble
[3:06] with I'm not Yeah. with the police. Now,
[3:08] I didn't put this in here. I was given
[3:09] this with the police or being at a park
[3:11] with Sister Shirley passed the park's
[3:13] curfew for someone his age. So, they
[3:16] must have been very young when they met
[3:18] each other, probably at some kind of
[3:20] youth church banquet just like this. Uh,
[3:23] Sister Shirley didn't get in trouble
[3:24] because she was a little just two years
[3:26] older. Brother Harvey served as song
[3:27] leader for Brother King and Brother
[3:29] Peterson in Phoenix, Arizona for about
[3:31] 40 years. They came from Arizona to
[3:33] Happy Valley around 2009 to be under
[3:36] Brother Reagan's ministry and and to be
[3:37] closer to their family. Uh, brother
[3:39] Harvey and sister Shirley have been have
[3:41] blessed the church many times with
[3:42] special songs. Brother Harvey is filled
[3:44] on and often as a song leader when uh
[3:47] when need when the need arose. We love
[3:48] and appreciate them very much and are
[3:50] thankful for their service. One other
[3:52] note that I'm I wanted to tell you, they
[3:54] were mentioning at the table that they
[3:55] actually uh had attended a meeting of
[3:58] brother Brandham's and what do you know?
[4:00] They didn't realize they're in prophecy
[4:02] and a couple of meetings that they were
[4:03] at and that they were physically at the
[4:05] rapture message which is just so
[4:07] astounding to have them with us. Thank
[4:09] you for being here and thank you for
[4:10] your
[4:16] service. And we have one more special
[4:19] guest right there in the back.
[4:23] Brother Byron
[4:25] Palmer. Brother Byron came into the
[4:28] message in 1955 at the age of
[4:32] 13. He was fortunate to be able to
[4:35] attend over a hundred meetings of
[4:37] Brother Brandhams throughout the years.
[4:39] His teenage years were spent attending
[4:41] meetings all over the country and
[4:43] sometimes during all night driving all
[4:46] night to get there and every time his
[4:48] family had a chance to go. He was
[4:50] fortunate to be able to meet brother
[4:52] Brandham on multiple occasions and
[4:53] witnessed many miracles in his ministry.
[4:56] His father was a pastor who hosted
[4:58] brother Brandham's meetings in Mon,
[5:00] Georgia in
[5:01] 1955. It was one of his longest
[5:04] campaigns in the states. He has served
[5:06] the Lord faithfully for all of his life,
[5:08] including being in positions of deacon,
[5:11] trustee, and served many years as a song
[5:13] leader. He moved to Happy Valley Church
[5:15] in 1996 and has been a faithful member
[5:17] of our congregation since that time. God
[5:20] bless you, Brother
[5:25] Byron. It's very, very special to have
[5:27] you all with
[5:29] us. All right. Now, as you can
[5:33] see, they are putting they're preparing
[5:36] a skit that they've been working very,
[5:38] very hard on. I thought I know that
[5:39] you're going to enjoy it. I've seen it a
[5:40] few times. It is absolutely outstanding.
[5:42] So, I do want this is family. We are
[5:46] family. Everybody's relaxed. Feeling
[5:48] good? Mason, you feeling good? You have
[5:49] plenty to eat. Steak's pretty good.
[5:51] Outstanding. I need everybody to get up.
[5:55] Move. Except maybe the older people can
[5:57] stay right there, but the younger people
[6:00] need to stand up and I want you to move
[6:02] your seats because I want you to get a
[6:05] good comfortable seat to be able to see
[6:08] the skit. Okay? I don't want you behind,
[6:11] you know, make yourself comfortable.
[6:13] Wherever you need to go, right? wherever
[6:16] you need to come up front a little bit.
[6:18] Want you to be comfortable. Okay?
[6:20] Whatever you need to
[6:22] do. Please know too that whenever uh we
[6:25] have brother Danny when he gives his
[6:27] message, I want you to be comfortable
[6:29] and don't be uh don't be behind a bush.
[6:32] Right? We want you to be comfortable and
[6:34] move your seat where you'd like to go.
[6:36] Okay? And make sure you see it.
[6:50] choir to line up.
[6:54] All right. And right after the the skip
[6:56] presentation, the choir will be singing
[6:58] directly after that if they could get
[7:00] ready when they hear the quote that they
[7:01] could go ahead and get ready after that
[7:03] time. And the Word of Life proudly
[7:06] presents
[8:03] Shoot.
[8:16] Um, maybe I should pack my Bible along
[8:18] with my workout gear, but I don't seem
[8:21] to have the room. Uh, I'll do it. I'll
[8:23] do it later when I get back. I got to
[8:25] got to make sure I have all my equipment
[8:26] to get these gains on this trip.
[8:38] Let's see. The flight information email
[8:41] said to make sure I have the true token,
[8:44] but let's be real. There's no way I
[8:46] won't make it on the plane. I mean, I
[8:48] play a very important role in the
[8:49] church. Surely, they'll understand that.
[8:51] That should be enough.
[9:11] I've been doing everything I can to take
[9:13] care of my hair, and boy has it paid
[9:15] off. But in all my research into hair
[9:17] health, and after my 12step hair
[9:19] routine, it doesn't leave me a lot of
[9:22] time for my daily devotion.
[9:24] Maybe I can squeeze
[9:26] these in the bag
[9:29] somewhere. But even though I haven't
[9:31] read the Bible in like two months, I do
[9:33] remember it says if a woman has long
[9:35] hair, it's her glory. So from glory to
[9:39] glory, right? Isn't that how it works?
[9:45] Probably. The flight pamphlet did
[9:47] mention something about a token. And I
[9:49] know the Bible also says a virtuous
[9:51] woman's price, which is clearly talking
[9:53] about someone like me, is far above
[9:55] rubies. And I figure that's as good as
[9:57] any token for sure. I think I'm all
[10:06] set. How do I even pack for eternity?
[10:09] I'm going to need to do some serious
[10:11] girl math here. Let's see.
[10:14] That's That's like a million outfits.
[10:17] I'm just going to bring it all. Let's be
[10:19] real. A one-sizefits-all robe is not my
[10:22] style. I've got shoes, hats,
[10:25] accessories. Now, what am I missing? Oh,
[10:28] yes, my checklist. I better go over that
[10:31] one more time. I feel like there was
[10:33] something missing from the do's column.
[10:35] I've definitely got the don'ts covered.
[10:37] No high heels cuz you have to walk the
[10:39] straight and narrow. Simple jewelry. You
[10:41] don't want to look like you walk through
[10:43] a dime shop with a magnet on. All of my
[10:45] skirts are six inches past the
[10:48] knee. Check. Check. Oh, that's what it
[10:51] was. The token. Honestly, I've got
[10:54] everything else checked off. I'm sure
[10:56] I'll have no problem getting that at the
[10:59] gate. Ow. Can you help me close this
[11:09] suitcase? I cannot wait to get to
[11:11] eternity. I'm going to be able to
[11:12] enlighten so many people. I'm bringing
[11:14] my Bible. Let's see. My message books,
[11:18] the seven seals, my tape recorder, and
[11:21] I'm pretty sure Brother Donniey's going
[11:23] to be there. So, I'm going to bring my
[11:24] notes from his latest sermon. There's a
[11:26] few things I need to critique him on. He
[11:28] just he just needs to know more. And oh,
[11:31] I also have the message book, The Token.
[11:34] So, I know I'm prepared.
[11:40] Okay. I've got my Bible, my toiletries,
[11:43] my clothes, but the most important thing
[11:46] I need is the token. And I know I've got
[11:49] it.
[12:23] Let's get this flight prepared.
[12:29] Is the captain ready for boarding? Yes,
[12:31] he's been ready for a long time.
[12:40] Now boarding Flight Eagle 7 bound for
[12:42] eternity zone one.
[12:48] Hello sir, welcome to Flight Eagle 7.
[12:50] Please open your bag so the security
[12:52] guard can check it and um hand me your
[12:54] token. Uh
[12:57] uh
[12:58] token? What do you mean token? Sir, to
[13:01] get on this flight, the token is
[13:03] required. Uh, token sounds familiar. Uh,
[13:08] what is the token again? The Holy
[13:11] Spirit.
[13:13] Okay. Uh, I don't know if I have that,
[13:16] but I'll tell you what I do have. Okay.
[13:19] So, you know how in the Bible it says
[13:21] your body is a temple?
[13:26] Well, this body is a temple built on
[13:31] blood, sweat, and
[13:35] tears. And you know, I'm I've been a
[13:39] good
[13:41] boy. I go to church every Sunday, every
[13:44] Wednesday, and special meetings. I mean,
[13:48] that's extra credit right there, you
[13:50] know. Uh let's see. Uh I I don't drink.
[13:54] I don't uh you know I don't cuss. I'm
[13:56] gonna need drug testing over here. Take
[13:59] drugs. Ladies and gentlemen, just for
[14:01] clarification purposes, that is
[14:04] chalk. And so, you know, everything I do
[14:07] is to glorify God. So, that should be
[14:10] enough even though I don't have the
[14:11] token. Right. Right. I'm sorry, sir. You
[14:14] have to know you can't board this
[14:16] flight. You know what? Forget it. You
[14:18] know what? Give me my bag. I don't need
[14:20] to take this flight. I'm going to board
[14:21] the train. the gain
[14:24] train. And while I'm waiting, I'm gonna
[14:26] sit down right here and get an awesome
[14:28] arm workout in.
[14:32] I hope the rest are not quite as
[14:34] dramatic as that. Let's hope.
[14:37] Now, boarding zone two.
[14:41] Hello, ma'am. Welcome to Flight Eagle 7.
[14:43] Please open your bag so we can check it.
[14:46] All right, there you
[14:48] go. I'm going to miss this place. It's
[14:52] quite an empty bag. Um,
[14:55] do you only have sheet music in here?
[14:57] Yes, I am the choir director. Emma Last
[15:00] Ring a bell? No. Nope. Try Emma Weber. I
[15:04] had a name change. Uh-uh. Still no.
[15:07] Whatever. Listen, this music is
[15:09] completely clean. No profanity here.
[15:12] Yeah. I mean, the words look great and
[15:14] everything. It looks like it was very
[15:16] well written, but you don't make it into
[15:18] eternity just based off gifts and
[15:20] talents. Yes, ma'am. We will need to see
[15:22] your token today. Oh, right. The token.
[15:25] Um, I haven't gotten that yet. Sorry.
[15:29] Yet? What? What do you mean by yet?
[15:31] Well, I I mean, I just haven't gotten
[15:33] around to getting it yet, but I'm sure I
[15:35] will one day. I'm sorry, ma'am. You need
[15:37] it to board this flight today. Wait,
[15:39] what? That That's ridiculous. I'm the
[15:42] choir director at Word of Life Church. I
[15:44] mean, I'm actively involved in the
[15:46] church, and I know there's going to be
[15:48] music in heaven. Who do you think's
[15:49] going to lead the choir up there? I'm
[15:51] telling you, they need me. And I know I
[15:54] should have read and prayed my Bible
[15:56] more, but I don't see why I need some
[15:58] token if I have a position in the
[16:02] church. Well, being all those things is
[16:04] wonderful, but that doesn't mean you
[16:06] have the token. You've received the
[16:08] flight information, and it was very
[16:10] clear about what the true token is.
[16:13] Don't be surprised when you see my
[16:15] review online. This is ridiculous.
[16:19] She's taking a trip. All right. On the
[16:20] good old drama ship.
[16:25] Now boarding zone
[16:30] three. Hello ma'am. Welcome to Flight
[16:33] Eagle 7. Um, can you please open your
[16:35] bag so my security agent can check it?
[16:37] Sure. Here you go.
[16:44] Okay. Taking everything else aside,
[16:46] there's enough liquid violations in this
[16:48] bag to keep you getting on any flight.
[16:51] Well, as you know, those of us that have
[16:54] read our Bible before, that a woman's
[16:56] hair is their glory, and these are all
[16:58] the products I use to take care of it.
[17:00] It clearly works. Can't you tell? H Yes.
[17:05] Very beautiful. Do you have your token?
[17:08] Well, I mean, in a way, I do. I mean,
[17:10] I've never cut my hair in my life. I've
[17:12] never even put the straightener on long
[17:14] enough to burn it. And don't even get me
[17:16] started on the fingernail clipper
[17:18] bangs. You can examine my bag if you
[17:21] need to, but you can clearly see I fit
[17:23] the description of a very virtuous
[17:26] woman. Well, your hair is very lovely
[17:29] and very long. But that doesn't mean you
[17:31] have the token. So, where is it at? Look
[17:34] me up in the system. I know I'm in the
[17:36] book. I'm sorry, ma'am. Your name is
[17:39] only in the book if you have the token.
[17:41] This is ridiculous. You mean I've been
[17:43] dealing with these split ends for
[17:44] nothing? Ma'am, if you don't have your
[17:46] token, you're going to have to step
[17:47] away. Hold up. I'm writing a bad review.
[17:51] You want to add anything? Yes, please.
[17:53] Okay, while you do that, I'm going to
[17:54] make a call.
[17:59] That looks good. Hey, Dad. Yes, son.
[18:02] Hey, uh, your baby Angel here. I'm at
[18:05] the I'm at the front desk right now, and
[18:06] they're saying I can't get on cuz I need
[18:08] the token thing. Um, I was wondering, do
[18:11] you have an extra that I can borrow?
[18:13] Emma, you know, you've got to have your
[18:14] own experience. What? What? Since when?
[18:20] This is a bit extreme. Who came up with
[18:22] this
[18:28] policy? Now boarding zone
[18:33] 4. Now boarding zone 4.
[18:37] This is the final boarding call for zone
[18:40] 4. You know, I don't even think she's
[18:41] coming. I don't I don't I don't She's
[18:43] She's coming. Well, better late than
[18:45] never. I'm going to need a bigger table.
[18:49] Hello, ma'am. Welcome to Flight Eagle 7.
[18:52] Please open up your many, many bags. Uh,
[18:55] so my security agent can I know I have a
[18:59] lot of baggage. I just couldn't let it
[19:00] go. Well, it definitely looks like you
[19:02] packed for eternity. it. You really
[19:05] think you need all of this clothes?
[19:06] Don't worry. They're all super modest
[19:09] outfits. And I hear there's a certain 65
[19:12] someone who's getting his hair back up
[19:14] there. Oh, here we go. So, I absolutely
[19:16] have to look my best. I can just picture
[19:19] us walking hand in hand in eternity. So
[19:24] romantic. Yes, that's very
[19:27] nice. Now, all of that aside, do you
[19:30] have the token? Well, actually, I have
[19:32] something even better. I have this list
[19:35] of dos and don'ts. I've meticulously
[19:38] kept it since I started this religion.
[19:41] As you can clearly see, just a few of
[19:44] them off the list. I never listen to
[19:46] anything but old southern gospel. If
[19:48] they weren't on Gaither Homecoming, I'm
[19:50] not listening to it. All of my clothes,
[19:53] as I've said, are super modest. I
[19:54] actually carry this tape measure around
[19:56] with me. See? At least six inches past
[19:59] the knee. It's way longer than your
[20:01] skirt. I'm just saying. And
[20:04] then I also never repeat gossip, so you
[20:09] better listen the first time. I'm just
[20:12] kidding. That's all jokes aside. I
[20:14] figured that's enough to get me in. I
[20:16] just don't I think that's pretty good. I
[20:19] am a great person. I'm practically
[20:21] perfect in every way, as they say. Well,
[20:23] okay, Mary Poppins. And I was even going
[20:25] to do you a favor and read through your
[20:27] list, but the most important thing on
[20:29] here. I can't even open it back up to
[20:32] Sean is the token. You don't even have
[20:35] it checked off. Well, see, I can't
[20:38] believe I forgot to mention that I was a
[20:40] Sunday school teacher. So, just think
[20:42] about all of those volunteer hours that
[20:45] I put in. I figured that would be enough
[20:47] to probably bump me up to first class at
[20:50] least. But you could at least do a girl
[20:52] a favor and maybe give me one of those
[20:54] last minute tokens, you know, at the
[20:56] gate. Last minute tokens. Yes, ma'am.
[21:00] That's not how it works. There are no
[21:02] last minute token. And giving your time
[21:05] for the Lord is great, but that's not it
[21:07] either. It has to be in your soul. Well,
[21:10] this is ridiculous. I might have to
[21:12] speak to your manager. He's busy. I
[21:15] spent at least $300 just in baggage
[21:17] fees.
[21:21] Ma'am, do you need help? No, thank you.
[21:31] Hey, watch it.
[21:37] The captain is almost ready for
[21:39] departure.
[21:41] Me and him
[21:44] both. Now boarding zone five.
[21:51] Hello, sir. Welcome to Fly Eagle 7,
[21:53] bound for eternity. Please open your bag
[21:55] so we can check it. Not necessary,
[21:57] ma'am. Trust me, I know. I'm prepared.
[21:59] Just let me on. This is not Spirit
[22:00] Airlines. We will need to see your bag.
[22:03] Unbelievable. There you go, sir. This is
[22:06] a very nice bag, sir. Yeah, I'm richer
[22:07] than you, dude.
[22:10] Okay.
[22:13] [Music]
[22:16] Um, is this all you have? Nothing but
[22:19] books. I take it you don't know who I
[22:22] am. You see, I'm a genius. Like, of
[22:24] course I'm going to bring books and
[22:25] everything else. I'm going on a flight
[22:27] to eternity. So, I have my message
[22:29] books, my Bible, tapes, my tape
[22:32] recorder, my notebooks with my
[22:34] critiques. Um, and I even brought
[22:36] microphone equipment. I'm starting up a
[22:38] podcast in heaven. It's all the rage
[22:40] now. I'm just going to share my
[22:41] knowledge with everybody. H. Well, that
[22:45] is a lot of books, but honestly, I'm not
[22:48] really interested in what's in your bag
[22:50] as much as I care about what's in your
[22:51] soul. So, do you have your token? Oh my
[22:55] goodness. There's a first time for
[22:58] everything. I made a
[23:01] mistake. Gosh, you look at your face.
[23:04] Look at me. I don't make mistakes. What
[23:06] are you talking about? Of course, I have
[23:08] the message book. the token preach 1963
[23:11] September 1st on a Sunday. Yeah, I know.
[23:13] You know, give me a quiz. I can get it.
[23:15] Boom. There you go. Let me take a look
[23:17] at that. Like you said, and I'm glad you
[23:20] know how to read, but this is just a
[23:22] message book. The token. This isn't a
[23:24] life. Yes, sir. Having message books or
[23:27] even claiming Brother Brandham is a
[23:28] prophet still does not mean you have the
[23:30] token.
[23:32] Okay. Uh, I'm following you. You're
[23:34] looking for the word of God. Hey, little
[23:36] buddy. How about you grab my Bible out
[23:37] of there? Hand it over to me. Yeah, see
[23:39] my Bible. Yeah, it's very well read and
[23:42] worn. Once again, reading the Bible is
[23:44] great and highly encouraged obviously,
[23:46] but it does need to take place in your
[23:48] heart. You're giving me the vibes. I'm a
[23:51] vibes guy. Um, you're giving me the
[23:53] vibes that you're like faith is the
[23:55] foundation and all that. You know,
[23:57] second Peter where it's talking about
[23:59] stature of a perfect man. Listen, when
[24:02] Peter was preaching that, he was
[24:03] preaching to the common man. You see,
[24:05] I've elevated myself above that with
[24:08] knowledge. Okay? I know so much and my
[24:11] understanding is beyond any of your tiny
[24:14] brains. I'm sorry, sir, but hedge head
[24:16] knowledge has nothing to do with the
[24:18] token. You can't board this flight
[24:21] without the token. What? I I know
[24:23] people. I'm related to people. David
[24:25] Syler is my cousin. Do you even know who
[24:27] that is?
[24:33] M. This is the final boarding call for
[24:36] Flight Eagle 7, Bound for Eternity,
[24:39] boarding zone
[24:42] 6. Hello, ma'am. Welcome to Flight Eagle
[24:45] 7. Um, do you have a bag, ma'am? I do.
[24:48] Okay. Just a small bag, though. I really
[24:52] don't need anything where I'm going.
[24:54] Okay. And do you have your token?
[24:57] Absolutely. I know for a fact I do. I've
[25:01] not lived a perfect life by any means,
[25:04] but I know the Holy Spirit lives inside
[25:06] of me. And the token is the most
[25:09] important thing I can take with me.
[25:11] Okay, great. And um what's your name?
[25:13] Haven. All right, let me check right
[25:16] here. Yes, your name is in the book.
[25:20] You're free to board this flight. What?
[25:22] She just went to Disney on a Sunday.
[25:30] out. Guys,
[25:33] this is exactly what I've been trying to
[25:35] tell you. The token doesn't mean you
[25:37] live a perfect life without mistakes. It
[25:40] means that when you fall short, you can
[25:42] repent and God will forgive you as if
[25:44] you've never done it in the first place.
[25:46] Haven is allowed in because he sees
[25:49] himself in her. He sees his holy spirit
[25:52] and that is the token
[25:55] required. All right, ma'am. Right this
[25:58] way. Do you know what it will be like
[26:01] over there? It's a place more beautiful
[26:04] than you've ever imagined. It's a place
[26:06] with no pain, no sorrow, no sickness, no
[26:10] death. It's a place of eternal peace and
[26:12] joy, eternal fellowship with God and
[26:15] with God's
[26:16] people. Maybe this song will help you
[26:19] understand.
[26:24] We've heard
[26:26] stories of
[26:30] paradise. Words fall
[26:32] short and can't
[26:37] describe. Everything you knew that it
[26:40] would
[26:43] be. Heaven is as real as you believe.
[26:50] I can almost see
[26:52] it. Flowing
[26:55] [Music]
[26:56] fountains, skies of blue, open plains
[27:00] and
[27:03] mountains, made up of colors as I've
[27:07] never
[27:10] seen. Heaven is as real as I
[27:15] believe. You see your
[27:18] grandpa, he'll be good as
[27:23] new. He'll catch you up on all that he's
[27:27] been up
[27:29] to. And you'll skip stones across the
[27:33] crystal
[27:36] sea. Heaven is as real as you
[27:40] [Music]
[27:41] believe. and all your
[27:45] questions will be
[27:48] answered. There'll be no need to find a
[27:52] cure for
[27:55] cancer. No more hungry children homeless
[27:59] in the
[28:00] [Music]
[28:02] streets. Heaven is as real as you
[28:08] believe. And no more fighting.
[28:12] No more
[28:15] faces. No more judging anybody cuz
[28:19] they're
[28:20] [Music]
[28:22] different. Grace will fall like crane on
[28:25] golden
[28:29] streets. Heaven is as real as you
[28:33] [Music]
[28:35] believe. Heaven is as real as you
[28:39] believe.
[28:40] [Music]
[28:43] Heaven is as
[28:46] real as I
[28:51] believe. And today, the Holy Ghost is
[28:55] God's covenant with God's covenant
[28:58] people. The Holy Ghost, the life of the
[29:01] resurrected Christ has got to be
[29:03] displayed in the church amongst the
[29:05] people. make it in the same yesterday,
[29:06] today, and forever.
[29:09] No matter how loyal ever you are, you
[29:12] might be whatever you may be, a good man
[29:14] or a good woman. That sure is fine. We
[29:17] appreciate that. But only the token will
[29:20] keep you alive. God's token. You might
[29:25] be a student of the Bible. You might be
[29:27] a good person. You could even be the
[29:29] president. You could be anything you
[29:32] want to be. There's no excuses.
[30:17] [Music]
[30:35] [Music]
[30:52] There are two roads.
[30:56] You may
[30:59] take one by
[31:01] [Music]
[31:02] side and one by
[31:07] faith. Take the word of God.
[31:12] Will you
[31:16] [Music]
[31:23] see your
[31:26] wings to the wind
[31:31] of you can
[31:34] fly in a higher place.
[31:40] Do not
[31:43] struggle. It's by
[31:47] grace. Set your
[31:50] wings to the winds of
[31:55] faith. What's
[31:59] your What's your cry?
[32:04] Watch your
[32:06] mountain. It's much too
[32:10] high. Speak the word of
[32:14] God. And by and
[32:19] by
[32:22] will you will
[32:26] fly. Set your
[32:29] wings to the wind of faith.
[32:35] You can

[32:42] place. Do not

[32:50] name. Send your

[33:05] sky. It does not

[34:40] grace. Send your
[34:44] wings to the winds of faith.
[34:53] [Applause]
[34:54] [Music]
[34:55] [Applause]
[35:11] I don't know.
[35:41] Thank you all so much for
[35:44] that.
[35:45] Um, they've asked me to kind of do what
[35:48] I did last year to summarize the skit.
[35:52] Um, with the brothers that are here, I
[35:55] feel sincerely
[35:57] inadequate to do
[36:00] that. Me and Brother Rob came
[36:03] in
[36:06] Sunday and watched the rehearsal.
[36:11] standing there
[36:13] and it spooked me to
[36:16] tears and all of a sudden I don't know
[36:18] why this thought came to my mind
[36:21] but I thought of the thief on the
[36:25] cross. Man, I know that but the thief
[36:28] was the first one to ever receive the
[36:31] token when the blood run down the cross.
[36:37] Sister Hanessa played what they call in
[36:40] the airline field a gate
[36:43] agent. Jesus introduced himself in John
[36:48] 14:6 as the gate
[36:51] agent. I am the truth, the
[36:54] way, the truth, and the
[36:57] life. No one cometh to the father but by
[37:01] me. He said, I'm the gate agent.
[37:07] All those people that you saw up here
[37:08] today sitting up here and living their
[37:10] their
[37:11] lives through man's eyes as holy as they
[37:15] portrayed
[37:17] themselves. Those are the people that
[37:18] crucified the gate
[37:21] agent. Those are the people that
[37:24] refused
[37:26] to because they thought they already had
[37:28] what it took to get
[37:31] in. But to the right side of the gate
[37:35] agent was somebody so
[37:37] filthy, so
[37:40] dirty, he probably didn't even know what
[37:42] the Ten Commandments were. He probably
[37:43] couldn't have told you who John the
[37:44] Baptist was. In fact, he didn't know who
[37:47] the gate agent was because he said,
[37:48] "This
[37:51] man, this man has done nothing
[37:56] wrong." He didn't know it, but he was
[37:58] the first passenger on that flight.
[38:03] What must I
[38:04] do to get on that
[38:08] flight? Do you realize when the gate
[38:10] agent looked at
[38:14] him, he couldn't refuse
[38:17] him, he'd already took his
[38:20] baggage. He already took everything he
[38:23] [Music]
[38:25] had. He took his
[38:27] lust, all his besetting sins. He took
[38:30] his whatever made him a thief, whatever
[38:32] made him a a murderer, he took
[38:35] [Music]
[38:36] that. But he told him this these this
[38:40] baggage can't enter
[38:42] there. But don't you worry, we're doing
[38:44] a layover in
[38:47] hell. We're going to drop it
[38:51] off. We're going to put it right back
[38:54] where it came from.
[38:59] Don't Don't feel like you can't come to
[39:01] him with your
[39:04] baggage. Satan's got a baggage claim in
[39:06] hell. He's waiting on
[39:09] you. He got first
[39:13] class. When Jesus looked at him, Jesus
[39:16] had to look through him through the TSA
[39:18] scanner of
[39:21] sanctification. It was as if he never
[39:23] done
[39:24] it. Whenever Sister Hadessa looked at
[39:27] Sister
[39:29] Haven, all we heard was Sister Haven
[39:32] say, "I have the token." And the gate
[39:34] agent said, "Yes, you do." When you go
[39:36] to board a plane, you're not getting on
[39:39] that plane without going to the gate
[39:41] agent first and showing your token, your
[39:44] boarding
[39:46] pass. But what Sister Hadessa said was
[39:49] the life, it was the life that was in
[39:53] her. You know, we we we we look at how
[39:56] that, you know, we we hear the quote,
[39:57] you know, we want to soar in heavenly
[39:59] places with Christ Jesus. When brother
[40:02] Brandon preached, deep call is to the
[40:04] deep. He said, when that deep calls out
[40:06] in
[40:07] you, there has to be a deep to
[40:11] respond. That's the token to soar in
[40:15] heavenly places with Christ Jesus. You
[40:17] have to have a portion of him.
[40:22] And let me say it this way. When brother
[40:24] Brandham talked about that little eagle
[40:25] in the in the
[40:27] barnyard amongst them
[40:29] chickens, when that he heard that
[40:32] scream, how did he
[40:35] recognize what that scream was? There
[40:38] was a portion of the one that screamed
[40:41] inside of
[40:43] him. That's what's going to bring you up
[40:45] to soar in heavenly places. I hope this
[40:48] get to me. I've watched it two or three
[40:50] times. I've cried every
[40:53] time it we
[40:56] complicate we complicate what what God
[40:58] has given
[40:59] freely. We try to work it up. I live a
[41:02] good life. I do this. I do that. Get his
[41:05] life in you. I wonder I was sitting at
[41:08] the table and I stole brother Rob's
[41:10] little
[41:11] card. And so quote brother Brandman 57
[41:15] and I'll close with this. The eagle in
[41:17] her nest.
[41:20] If we can only take the wings of the
[41:22] Bible, God's written word that God gave
[41:24] his church to fly away
[41:27] with and have as much confidence in the
[41:30] word of God that's in the word that you
[41:32] hear on Sundays, on Wednesdays, in the
[41:35] word when you when you get in your car
[41:36] and you're listening to a tape, you're
[41:38] reading the book. Have as much
[41:41] confidence in the word of God by the
[41:42] Holy Spirit to furnish the breeze to
[41:45] pack us
[41:46] away. if we'd only have as much
[41:49] confidence as the eagle does in his
[41:53] wings. God bless
[41:56] [Music]
[42:09] you. As we continue, one more thing to
[42:13] take care
[42:15] of. I want to ask brother Byron Palmer
[42:18] if he would go ahead and pick out a card
[42:22] if he would. The lucky winner of a We
[42:24] have a gift basket we want to give out.
[42:31] Byron Palmer. Byron Palmer won the whole
[42:33] thing. Oh my goodness. Brother John
[42:36] Hornac. Brother John Hornac, come on
[42:39] forward. Let's hear for brother John
[42:41] Hornac. Give him a round of applause.
[42:45] [Applause]
[42:49] Come on
[42:56] up. The number of gifts in this are out
[42:58] is just outstanding. There are gift
[43:00] cards. There's a number of different
[43:01] things. And I'll tell you, it warmed my
[43:02] heart to see all of you go ahead and
[43:04] network. I appreciate it. God bless you
[43:06] and congratulations. All
[43:08] [Applause]
[43:11] right. And now we'll ask brother Donnie
[43:13] to introduce our speaker for the
[43:27] night. It's been awesome for us to be
[43:29] together thus far, hasn't
[43:32] it? We're so honored that each of you
[43:35] had come to be with us. Different states
[43:38] that you're represented from, different
[43:39] churches. We certainly appreciate that.
[43:42] Want you to be sure and greet your
[43:44] pastor and your family when you go back
[43:46] home. We're going to invite brother
[43:48] Danny to come while the presence of the
[43:51] Lord is so near us. We can just sense
[43:53] him here. I believe he's come to
[43:57] minister to each of our hearts. You've
[43:59] heard it preached for years. Many of you
[44:01] been raised in church. A lot of you
[44:04] don't ever
[44:05] underestimate just that little skit that
[44:08] you
[44:08] saw be the greatest thing you'll ever be
[44:11] able to accomplish in your life is to
[44:14] make sure the life of Jesus. All those
[44:16] wonderful things and things that they
[44:18] described, those are good things to
[44:21] do. We don't want to see one of you that
[44:24] won't be there that day. So, we just
[44:27] open our hearts to the Lord. Now we
[44:29] going about brother Danny if you just
[44:30] come and obey the
[44:36] Lord. Certainly appreciate our brother.
[44:38] Can we just give him a nice warm
[44:40] [Applause]
[44:56] welcome? Praise the Lord.
[44:58] How many's happy to be here this
[45:00] evening? How many's enjoyed everything
[45:03] so far? Amen. Well, we trust that it'll
[45:06] be the same as we go forward. And just
[45:08] want to say what an honor it is to be
[45:11] able to come and to be a part of this
[45:14] and to just join our efforts um in in
[45:19] this time together.
[45:22] Um, I know the age that we live in is in
[45:27] the prophet's own words, it's the most
[45:29] evil
[45:30] age that there's ever
[45:32] been. And the things that the scriptures
[45:36] say about this time,
[45:38] uh, it's the hardest age that it's ever
[45:41] been. um even temptation. Brother
[45:45] Brandon would make the statement that
[45:47] it'd be 10 times worse from one
[45:50] generation to another generation and
[45:52] then even down to the time that we live
[45:54] in. So, it's such a challenge. But then
[45:57] on the other side, brother Brandham said
[45:59] that it's the grandest
[46:01] age and so want to talk about what part
[46:04] you have to play in it with the help of
[46:06] the Lord. Let's all stand together and
[46:08] just pray if we can.
[46:15] Father, we love you. We're so thankful,
[46:18] Lord, that we can come together like
[46:20] this, Lord, and just have a voice,
[46:23] Father, to encourage these young people,
[46:26] Lord. And you knowing every need that is
[46:28] here. You know every heart. We believe,
[46:31] Father, you're the same yesterday,
[46:33] today, and forever, Lord. And you still
[46:35] work the same. And I just pray that you
[46:37] would minister to the needs, Lord, among
[46:40] us. Speak to them, I pray, in a real
[46:42] way. May you get the glory and the honor
[46:44] for it, Lord, as we've listened to the
[46:47] skit and the songs and our hearts have
[46:48] been moved, Lord. And we see you working
[46:51] amongst it, Lord. Will you just continue
[46:53] that, Father, and move in their hearts,
[46:55] we pray, where we ask these things in
[46:58] the name of Jesus Christ.
[47:00] Amen. Amen. I I uh realize that the
[47:05] theme is to soar in heavenly places. Um
[47:10] this may not quite seem like that I
[47:13] followed exactly that theme, but uh
[47:16] because I'm going to speak to you on a
[47:18] man uh by the name of Solomon. How
[47:20] many's heard of
[47:21] him? All right. Well, I guess I need to
[47:24] introduce him to most of you then. Uh,
[47:27] but I want to I want to talk about him
[47:30] because, you know, we we look in the
[47:32] scriptures and we want to be able to
[47:34] find ourselves. Where do we fit in? What
[47:36] what is our part to play? And and I
[47:37] realize I'm I'm speaking to young people
[47:40] that maybe you're you're wondering,
[47:41] "What is my part? What do I have to do?"
[47:44] Seems like all the work is already done.
[47:46] The church has been built. The messages
[47:47] are gone forth. What part do I have to
[47:51] play in what we call the message of the
[47:54] hour? What has God got for me?
[47:56] Well, I just want to say
[47:58] that you are the most important people
[48:02] on the face of the earth.
[48:06] And I want to I want to take a a thought
[48:08] if I can and I and I want to title it
[48:12] continuation.
[48:14] Continuation. And I want to read out
[48:17] of read a couple places in scripture. 1
[48:20] Chronicles
[48:21] 22 verse 5 and verse 6.
[48:27] And David said,"Solomon, my son, is
[48:30] young and tender, and the house that is
[48:33] to be builded for the Lord must be
[48:36] exceeding magnical, of fame and of glory
[48:39] throughout all countries. I will
[48:41] therefore now make preparation for it."
[48:44] So David prepared abundantly before his
[48:47] death.
[48:49] That um
[48:52] word tender
[48:55] means Solomon is weak and he's
[49:01] indecisive. But
[49:03] yet he's going to be the one to build
[49:06] the
[49:07] house. And then he called for Solomon
[49:10] his son and he charged him to build a
[49:13] house for the Lord God of Israel.
[49:16] Now I want to read out of first kings 2
[49:19] verse
[49:20] one. Now the days of David drew nigh
[49:23] that he should die. And he charged
[49:24] Solomon his son, saying, I go the way of
[49:27] all the earth. Be thou strong,
[49:30] therefore, and show thyself a man, and
[49:33] keep the charge of the Lord thy God, to
[49:36] walk in his ways, to keep his statutes,
[49:39] and his commandments, and his judgments,
[49:42] and his testimonies, as is written in
[49:45] the law of Moses, that you may prosper
[49:48] in all that thou doest, and whatsoever
[49:50] there turnest thyself, that the Lord may
[49:54] continue his word which he spake
[49:57] concerning me,
[49:59] saying, "If thy children take heed to
[50:01] their way, to walk before me in truth
[50:04] with all their heart, with all their
[50:06] soul, there shall not fail thee," said
[50:08] he, a man on the throne of Israel. Amen.
[50:11] God bless you. You can be
[50:16] seated. That word continue is a verb
[50:20] meaning to rise up and to stand up. So
[50:25] David is saying that the Lord may cause
[50:28] his word to rise
[50:30] up. And as I've already said, brother
[50:34] Brandham said that this age we're living
[50:36] in is one of the grandest ages of all
[50:38] ages. The Leosa age is the grandest age
[50:42] of all the church ages because it's the
[50:44] ending of time and the blending of
[50:47] eternity. And then it's also the
[50:50] greatest sinful age. It's more sin in
[50:52] this age than there's ever been. And the
[50:55] power of Satan is many times harder to
[50:57] fight against than it was in any age.
[51:00] How many can agree? Amen. Of course, we
[51:02] didn't live in any other age, but we can
[51:05] say the powers of Satan is hard to fight
[51:09] against. Uh in other ages, a Christian
[51:12] with his profession uh of just belonging
[51:15] to the church uh he could lose his head,
[51:17] he could lose his life, be put out of
[51:20] his misery. The prophet said, "And go
[51:21] meet God quickly." But now what makes
[51:24] this age so hard is that Satan has come
[51:27] in the name of a church. He's come and
[51:29] he's come in deception.
[51:32] And and Christ said that it'd be so
[51:34] deceiving in this age that these two
[51:36] spirits would be so close. It would
[51:38] deceive the very elect if it were
[51:40] possible.
[51:42] Now, right there, Christ has already
[51:44] mentioned, I will have an elect at the
[51:47] end time. Amen. This is the age of the
[51:51] personal life of Christ. The scriptures
[51:55] in describing this age call it a time of
[51:58] lukewarmness. To be lukewarm is is to be
[52:02] in a condition that will uh induce a
[52:05] person to vomit. You're neither in,
[52:08] you're neither out. Just a half-hearted
[52:12] partial effort kind of condition. And
[52:15] God said, "I'll spew it out of my
[52:17] mouth."
[52:19] It's a condition that when evaluating
[52:21] themselves, they can find nothing wrong
[52:23] because they say we're clothed. We
[52:25] already saw the skit about it. God says
[52:27] they're naked. They say they're rich.
[52:29] God says they're poor.
[52:32] They say they have need of nothing. And
[52:34] God says you're wretched and miserable.
[52:37] Now, what kind of condition is that?
[52:39] Sounds like the language we we hear
[52:41] today. Maybe you've heard it. I have my
[52:42] truth. How many's ever heard that? Well,
[52:45] this is my truth and you have your
[52:48] truth. Well, the truth is they they they
[52:50] say my truth is to live the way I want
[52:53] to. But the truth of it is Jesus said I
[52:56] am the truth, the way and the life.
[52:59] Amen. Because he is the only truth.
[53:01] Another another pressure in this age,
[53:04] amen, is uh the prophet said is the
[53:07] pressure of riches,
[53:09] soft
[53:10] living, nervous tension in a complex age
[53:14] that we seem unfitted to live in. Paul
[53:17] said the last day would be
[53:19] perilous, perilous times. That word
[53:21] perilous means fierce and hard to
[53:24] take. And and in describing that kind of
[53:27] condition, he would say the people of
[53:30] this last days would be
[53:32] pretenders. They would have a form of
[53:34] godliness, but they would deny the power
[53:37] thereof.
[53:39] And so I I can't think of a a better
[53:41] word than to describe that kind of
[53:43] condition today, and that is pretenders.
[53:48] We live in an age of a of advancement of
[53:50] science, and it has given Satan many
[53:54] platforms to
[53:56] attack you
[53:57] with. Every one of them are voices
[54:00] seeking to counsel you, seeking to
[54:02] influence you, and seeking to guide you.
[54:06] Amen. All of these are are attacks of
[54:13] Satan. Brother Benham said that Satan
[54:16] will attempt to destroy the personal
[54:20] experience of the spirit of God dwelling
[54:22] in us.
[54:24] And the experience of God is when he
[54:27] comes in, he illuminates your mind and
[54:30] by wisdom and knowledge of God through
[54:32] the word as the as the scripture would
[54:35] say that he would grant you according to
[54:38] the riches of his glory to be
[54:40] strengthened with might by his spirit in
[54:42] the inner man. that Christ may dwell in
[54:45] your hearts by faith. That you being
[54:48] rooted and grounded in love may be able
[54:50] to comprehend with all saints what is
[54:53] the breadth and length and depth and
[54:55] height. Hallelujah. And to know the love
[54:58] of Christ which passes knowledge that
[55:02] you might be filled with all the
[55:04] fullness of God.
[55:06] But the depth of Satan will be he'll
[55:09] attempt to destroy that. Come on. He
[55:11] will, as always, attempt to make a
[55:15] substitute for reality.
[55:18] Amen. He will. And the prophet said,
[55:20] "How will he do it?" He will do it by
[55:22] taking away the knowledge of the truth
[55:25] of God. As we heard brother David
[55:27] preach, we live in a time of knowledge.
[55:29] Men are uh knowledge is increased, but
[55:32] they're never able to come to the
[55:35] knowledge of the truth. Amen. So he will
[55:39] take away the knowledge of the truth of
[55:40] God by destroying the word and putting
[55:43] forth his own and here say yeah hath God
[55:46] said and then he will substitute the
[55:48] personal Christ in our spirits. Amen.
[55:51] He'll do that here substitute the born
[55:53] again
[55:55] experience. Amen. Just like Israel did.
[55:59] Amen. They chose a king instead of God.
[56:02] And here, substitute that born again
[56:04] experience and it will be rejected in
[56:07] favor of church
[56:09] joining. I trust you bear with me a
[56:11] little bit because I'm going to get to
[56:12] Solomon, but I'm just talking about the
[56:14] age we live in and the challenges that
[56:16] you face. Amen. I want you to know God
[56:18] is not here to condemn you. He's here to
[56:20] help you. Amen. He's here to come
[56:22] alongside you and he wants you to know,
[56:25] Amen, your part in the kingdom of God.
[56:28] Amen. And you're not some poor beat down
[56:30] person that just happened to get here.
[56:32] In fact, to even be in this room, you
[56:34] had to have an invitation. And look
[56:36] what's happened. You might be sitting at
[56:39] your at your table thinking, "Nobody
[56:41] loves me. Nobody cares for me." Look
[56:43] what's happened. Somebody had a burden
[56:45] on their heart. Somebody gave you an
[56:48] invitation. Amen. Somebody put your name
[56:51] on it.
[56:53] Hallelujah. So he wants you to know.
[56:56] Amen. Amen. So, uh, if if Satan's going
[57:00] to try to take away this this personal
[57:04] experience with God and and put a a
[57:07] substitute in it as as we've seen so
[57:09] well played out. I I want to make an
[57:12] observation on that is that's why we see
[57:15] the attacks that that we see the kind of
[57:17] attacks that are coming forth that is
[57:19] coming on our minds fears, doubts,
[57:23] anxiety, depression, uncertainty,
[57:26] confusion. Amen. Coming in like a flood
[57:28] and sweeping people away with its power.
[57:32] Yes.
[57:35] Amen. But this has been predicted. It
[57:38] already said it would be this way.
[57:42] God already said that's the age that
[57:45] it'll be. That the those that claim to
[57:48] know me will have actually put me
[57:51] outside
[57:53] and they will not think they need me.
[57:56] they will have substituted me with
[57:59] church joining and and and being
[58:01] satisfied with my social circle
[58:05] and the times that I spend listen as we
[58:09] minister and and and spend time in the
[58:11] word and spend time dealing with people
[58:14] I'm running across more and more young
[58:16] people they're more worried about not
[58:18] fitting in with one another
[58:21] and I and I've tried to tell them I said
[58:24] amen you're only telling me you're not
[58:26] satisfied with your relationship with
[58:28] Jesus Christ.
[58:30] Because if you have that relationship
[58:33] with him, friend or no friend, circle or
[58:36] no circle, fitting in or not fitting in,
[58:40] there's a reality in your heart. Amen.
[58:44] Praise the name of the Lord. But that's
[58:45] the age we're in. And it would be this
[58:48] age as the prophet said, "This is
[58:50] Satan's Eden. This is not God's Eden."
[58:54] Amen. This is not perfection. This is
[58:56] perversion. Amen.
[58:59] This is where Amen. the Holy Ghost has
[59:02] been so watered down that you can live
[59:04] any way you want to and be anything you
[59:07] want to because you have your
[59:10] truth and we're not allowed to judge.
[59:14] So he said it's that way. But because
[59:17] this age is moving the way it is and
[59:19] it's so fast and so much pressure upon
[59:21] the people. Amen. as the Bible said that
[59:25] God said they're wretched and they're
[59:27] miserable. Now he said this age has
[59:29] actually gone through
[59:31] trial. He said but that is not the
[59:33] attitude of a Christian as they go
[59:35] through trial. Amen. But it's the
[59:37] attitude of the age as they go through
[59:39] trial because a Christian as they go
[59:42] through trial, Amen, they receive
[59:44] strength as they go through it. They
[59:45] they actually can have joy as they go
[59:48] through it. Amen. Because they have
[59:50] somebody that they're in relationship
[59:52] with. But when you don't have that,
[59:54] you're wretched and you're
[59:56] miserable. And the prophet said that
[59:58] suddenly we see mental illness taking a
[1:00:01] toll upon the nation.
[1:00:04] A darkness coming in. And what is it? He
[1:00:07] said it's the advancement of science is
[1:00:09] moving so
[1:00:10] fast. Amen. That the human mind cannot
[1:00:13] keep up with how fast it's moving. That
[1:00:16] in just a short time it went from the
[1:00:18] buggy age all the way to the space age.
[1:00:22] Amen. Amen. And so it's moved. And so,
[1:00:25] as he said, without a known reason,
[1:00:27] men's hearts are failing for fear.
[1:00:30] Amen. The world is so dark in this age
[1:00:33] could well be called the age of
[1:00:35] neurotics. Amen. I think we're all well
[1:00:38] aware of that. And he says they're
[1:00:40] miserable. So then I ask you, Amen. In
[1:00:44] this kind of age, why did God call you
[1:00:46] here? Amen.
[1:00:49] Why didn't he call somebody more worthy
[1:00:52] of the age and more worthy to fight this
[1:00:55] kind of pressure?
[1:00:57] Because if it's the hardest age of every
[1:01:01] age, then why didn't God call his
[1:01:03] greatest warriors?
[1:01:05] Come on, man. And bring them down to
[1:01:08] this time. Why didn't he line up? Amen.
[1:01:12] David and Amen. We talk about him. Amen.
[1:01:14] We preach about him. Why didn't he put
[1:01:16] him here on the front row?
[1:01:20] Amen.
[1:01:22] Amen. Why didn't he bring a Samson?
[1:01:25] I think we saw him tonight,
[1:01:27] but
[1:01:29] man. Amen. No, actually we didn't. But
[1:01:32] Amen. Why didn't he bring a Samson? Can
[1:01:33] you imagine the greatest age that God
[1:01:35] would say, "I'm going to bring a Samson.
[1:01:37] I'm going to bring a David." Amen. The
[1:01:39] devil don't know what's going to hit
[1:01:42] him. But God never works that way.
[1:01:45] Because in their
[1:01:47] age, they also were weak.
[1:01:52] In their age and in their time, they
[1:01:55] weren't nothing to look at either. Oh,
[1:01:57] no. Now, forgive me. You're something to
[1:01:59] look at. All right. You look pretty. You
[1:02:01] look
[1:02:01] handsome. All right. But God could have
[1:02:05] done
[1:02:06] that. I was listening to the prophet as
[1:02:08] he's praying. And he said, "Father,
[1:02:10] Moses wasn't worthy of going down to
[1:02:12] Egypt, but you chose him."
[1:02:16] Peter, that we heard about last night,
[1:02:19] he wasn't worthy to be the apostle, but
[1:02:21] you chose him.
[1:02:24] And we are not our own. We're bought.
[1:02:27] And I'm not worthy to be your servant,
[1:02:28] but you have chosen them.
[1:02:31] Come on.
[1:02:33] I had read an article
[1:02:36] um from the National Archives um
[1:02:39] Benjamin Franklin had printed from back
[1:02:42] in
[1:02:43] 1744 and and it was a discussion and an
[1:02:48] invitation from the College of William
[1:02:50] and Mary and they were talking about the
[1:02:52] Native Indians and how to deal with
[1:02:54] them. And this college sent a letter to
[1:02:58] six Native American chiefs and they
[1:03:00] offered free education to 12 of the
[1:03:03] young
[1:03:05] braves. And the chiefs in this article
[1:03:09] said they politely declined the offer
[1:03:12] with the following reply. said, "So our
[1:03:14] young people were formerly brought up at
[1:03:17] the colleges of the northern provinces,
[1:03:19] and they were instructed in all your
[1:03:21] sciences, but when they came back to us,
[1:03:25] they were bad
[1:03:26] runners. They were ignorant of every
[1:03:28] means of living in the woods. They were
[1:03:31] unable to bear cold or hunger. They
[1:03:33] neither knew how to build a cabin, take
[1:03:36] a deer, kill an enemy. They spoke our
[1:03:39] language imperfectly. and they were
[1:03:41] neither fit for hunters, warriors, or
[1:03:44] counselors. They were totally good for
[1:03:47] nothing. The chiefs then made an offer
[1:03:49] of their own. They said, "If the
[1:03:52] gentleman of
[1:03:53] Virginia will send us a dozen of their
[1:03:56] sons, we'll take care of their
[1:03:59] education, and we're instruct them in
[1:04:01] all we know, and we will make men of
[1:04:04] them."
[1:04:06] Amen. You see, that's what this age,
[1:04:08] Amen, has done. It has taken away
[1:04:11] manhood.
[1:04:13] It has taken away identity until people
[1:04:16] don't even know what they are. I I saw a
[1:04:19] ballot for San Francisco for for voting
[1:04:22] and there was actually uh 72 choices you
[1:04:25] could choose to identify
[1:04:28] as.
[1:04:30] 72. I'm getting to the age I'm glad I
[1:04:32] can just say I I know I'm I know who I
[1:04:35] am.
[1:04:38] You'll get that.
[1:04:40] later. I appreciate you for saying
[1:04:43] amen.
[1:04:45] Amen. Amen. You can choose to identify
[1:04:48] however you want because you have your
[1:04:50] truth. But this age is not making men.
[1:04:54] It's not forming you into anything that
[1:04:56] can meet the challenge of the hour.
[1:04:59] Amen. But our Jesus said, "But as many
[1:05:02] as received him," John wrote, "To them
[1:05:05] gave he power.
[1:05:09] to do to will do what? To become sons of
[1:05:12] God. Amen. Amen. I'm I'm here to tell
[1:05:15] you they're not born of the will of man.
[1:05:17] They're not born of blood. You're not
[1:05:19] born into this because of your
[1:05:20] genealogy. Amen. Not by the will of
[1:05:23] flesh. I cannot put you in it. But I
[1:05:25] also can't take you out of it.
[1:05:28] Amen. You are born by the spirit of God.
[1:05:32] Amen. Not the will of man, the spirit of
[1:05:35] God.
[1:05:37] Amen.
[1:05:40] Solomon has been born into the royal
[1:05:42] household of David somehow. Amen. How
[1:05:45] many Solomon's we got here? You know, I
[1:05:47] was thinking about him that when David
[1:05:48] told him to be a man and when he told
[1:05:49] him he's young and tender, uh the
[1:05:52] historians, they all give a different
[1:05:54] time time that they thought how old
[1:05:56] Solomon was when that was written and
[1:05:58] when he he became king. Some said he was
[1:06:00] as young as 11. Josephus said he was 14.
[1:06:03] Can you imagine? Amen. Solomon couldn't
[1:06:05] even he wasn't even old enough to come
[1:06:07] to this
[1:06:11] banquet. Think about it. He had to be
[1:06:13] home with
[1:06:15] mom. But yet he's becoming a
[1:06:19] king. Amen. Scofield in his time he said
[1:06:22] he was 20 years old. Amen. When he
[1:06:25] became
[1:06:26] king. And as he's approaching this time,
[1:06:30] Amen.
[1:06:32] There's not a record of anything Solomon
[1:06:35] has
[1:06:36] done. We don't have a record of Solomon
[1:06:39] saying anything before he becomes
[1:06:44] king. By the age of 20, we'll just take
[1:06:47] the age of
[1:06:49] 20. His
[1:06:52] father
[1:06:54] David had already been anointed by
[1:06:56] Samuel to be the king of Israel. He had
[1:06:58] killed a bear. He'd killed a lion. He'd
[1:07:01] killed a
[1:07:03] giant. You know, young people, many
[1:07:06] times you feel overshadowed by those
[1:07:08] that have went before you. Come on. And
[1:07:11] you look at them and you say, "Well, I I
[1:07:12] haven't done anything." Well, I'm
[1:07:13] telling you, Amen. There's not a record
[1:07:16] of Solomon saying or doing anything.
[1:07:20] But yet David in in the book of of first
[1:07:24] Chronicles, he says, "Of all my sons,
[1:07:28] and I have many, God chose Solomon."
[1:07:34] God chose Solomon. David had
[1:07:37] sons that would fit the mold of a king.
[1:07:40] They looked more like a king. They had
[1:07:42] the They had the entitlement to be king.
[1:07:45] They had the ambition to be king.
[1:07:48] They had the talent to be king and they
[1:07:51] even thought they would be king and they
[1:07:53] tried to take the kingship.
[1:07:57] You can read it in your Bible. First
[1:07:59] Kings 1. Amen. Adinijah, the Bible says
[1:08:01] about him. He was pleasant to look at.
[1:08:03] He was he was goodly looking just like
[1:08:05] it said about Abselum. That was his
[1:08:07] vanity. He was good-looking. Said but ne
[1:08:09] his father David never displeased him at
[1:08:11] any time. That word displeas corrected
[1:08:14] him, never crossed him, never formed
[1:08:16] him, never taught him
[1:08:19] anything. But yet, when his father is
[1:08:22] getting old, the Bible says he's old in
[1:08:25] age. Don't look like he's doing
[1:08:31] anything. Don't look like he has any
[1:08:33] more power.
[1:08:35] Look like he can't remember anymore.
[1:08:37] Come on.
[1:08:39] The Bible said that Adinijah he formed a
[1:08:42] retinue around him. He formed people to
[1:08:43] run before him and said, "I am the
[1:08:47] king." And it even pulled some of
[1:08:49] David's old warriors and priests into
[1:08:52] that movement. And it became a very
[1:08:54] powerful movement. We don't hear a word
[1:08:57] from
[1:09:00] Solomon. You know, he's young and
[1:09:01] tender. He's weak. He's indecisive.
[1:09:06] He's not sure what he's going to
[1:09:08] be. He don't know what God has called
[1:09:10] him to do. All right.
[1:09:14] Yet, here's his brother. Good to look
[1:09:18] at.
[1:09:20] Amen. Amen. Even so much so that David's
[1:09:24] top general says, "I'll follow
[1:09:27] him." Even so much so that David's
[1:09:30] priest says, "I'll follow him."
[1:09:34] And here up they go and they're
[1:09:35] shouting. They're
[1:09:37] rejoicing. It looks like somebody's
[1:09:39] going to take his
[1:09:41] place. You know, when you begin to think
[1:09:43] God doesn't move, you know, David's old.
[1:09:47] They kind of begin to think that way
[1:09:48] about God that he don't do anything.
[1:09:50] He's the ancient of days anyway. You
[1:09:53] know, I tell you, he hasn't lost his
[1:09:56] power. That's right. Because you know
[1:09:59] where the power of the king is? His
[1:10:02] word. Amen.
[1:10:04] I tell you, this word is alive and this
[1:10:06] word is full of power. Amen. I want to
[1:10:09] say it again. This word is alive and
[1:10:11] this word is full of power. Amen. And
[1:10:14] you cannot receive this word unless God
[1:10:16] has already created a place inside of
[1:10:18] you. Amen. That will fit the word of
[1:10:20] God. That's why you're here. You say,
[1:10:22] "Well, how do I know you're here? Let's
[1:10:25] start right there."
[1:10:30] But your life can be overshadowed by
[1:10:33] those that go before
[1:10:35] you. David has lived a full life. He's
[1:10:38] anointed. He's gifted. He's a mighty
[1:10:41] warrior. He's a mighty king. He's a
[1:10:43] gifted songwriter. Amen. He's an
[1:10:45] anointed heart player that when he would
[1:10:48] play, Amen. evil spirits would get
[1:10:50] uncomfortable around him. They would
[1:10:51] begin to move and they would leave.
[1:10:54] Amen. In David's lifetime, he became
[1:10:56] very
[1:10:59] wealthy. His worth, David's worth, was
[1:11:01] in the
[1:11:04] billions, billions of dollars. I don't
[1:11:06] know why Trump's voice just flashed
[1:11:08] across my head, said billions and
[1:11:10] billions and billions, but it did, so I
[1:11:12] just said it. But
[1:11:17] his his wealth was in the billions of
[1:11:20] dollars. And I I'm sure D Solomon had
[1:11:22] listened to many stories of his father
[1:11:25] from the lips of other warriors describe
[1:11:27] the exploits of David call him the light
[1:11:30] of
[1:11:32] Israel. Those that were there the day
[1:11:35] Goliath was killed. I'm sure that they
[1:11:38] would tell him and and maybe as time
[1:11:40] went on the story embellished. I don't
[1:11:41] know. The giant might have got taller.
[1:11:43] He might have got wider. He might have
[1:11:44] got bigger. I don't know. But they would
[1:11:47] all remember this. David when it came
[1:11:49] time nobody else would fight that he
[1:11:52] meant he stepped out there and said I'll
[1:11:54] fight him and and all of them could
[1:11:56] recount all these warriors could recount
[1:11:57] as this boy this me this this young man
[1:12:00] ran to meet the giant Solomon's hearing
[1:12:03] all this how could I
[1:12:05] ever be that
[1:12:13] but you know what it's the character of
[1:12:16] God to come to the
[1:12:19] That's his
[1:12:20] character. And to lay upon the young in
[1:12:24] age or inexperience to lay upon them a
[1:12:27] burden that seems impossible to
[1:12:33] fulfill. It seems like that burden would
[1:12:36] be too big for an older and more
[1:12:39] experienced person. But God sees what's
[1:12:41] in that person.
[1:12:44] He knows what's there. and the burden is
[1:12:46] not too big for them. They just need to
[1:12:49] realize they're the one God's called.
[1:12:52] And he has called you to mature that
[1:12:55] prophecy that was spoken.
[1:12:58] I want you to notice that when God calls
[1:13:00] a person, he tells them what to
[1:13:03] do. Sometimes what he tells you is
[1:13:06] nothing more than follow me.
[1:13:11] And maybe all he asks, follow me. That
[1:13:14] don't mean you're not doing
[1:13:15] anything. But he wants to cultivate
[1:13:18] something in you as you follow him.
[1:13:21] Amen. That you're going to learn, Amen,
[1:13:23] how to be patient. And when you learn to
[1:13:26] be patient, then you're useful to him
[1:13:29] because he can use you. Because if
[1:13:30] you're not patient, you're always going
[1:13:31] to interrupt him. How many's ever done
[1:13:33] that with your
[1:13:35] parents? Well, my goodness. What kind of
[1:13:37] houses are up here anyway? Just the
[1:13:40] older people. I mean I okay son if
[1:13:42] you're listening I'm sorry but hey man
[1:13:44] uh you know my I I start telling my sons
[1:13:46] hey you got to do they say I
[1:13:48] know I had even told
[1:13:50] them but they already
[1:13:53] know. Amen. And if you're going to
[1:13:55] follow the Lord you can't keep telling
[1:13:56] them you know. Come on now. Hey I I hope
[1:14:01] this is all right. Brother Donnie can
[1:14:02] correct me afterwards. Amen. If you're
[1:14:04] there. And
[1:14:07] uh I remember I I was talking to a guy
[1:14:09] in counsel about his children,
[1:14:11] everything. I said, "Hey brother,
[1:14:12] they're doing this and they're doing
[1:14:13] this and they're doing this." And he
[1:14:13] kept saying, "I know. I know. I know. I
[1:14:14] know. I know. I know. I know." And and
[1:14:16] he wasn't even listening to me. He kept
[1:14:17] saying, "I know. I know. I know. I
[1:14:18] know." And I said, "You don't know." He
[1:14:19] goes, "I guess I don't
[1:14:22] know." But that's kind of the way we get
[1:14:24] with
[1:14:26] God because we're nervous to be around
[1:14:28] when he says, "Follow me."
[1:14:33] God's going to do something. And
[1:14:36] sometimes you may be old. Moses was a
[1:14:40] man of 80 years old, but he was young
[1:14:42] and
[1:14:43] experienced. And God called him and God
[1:14:48] God gave him very specific instructions
[1:14:50] what to do. And he taught him how to
[1:14:51] trust him. I you know I I don't know
[1:14:54] sometimes maybe I would like to have
[1:14:56] been there to be able to see him tell
[1:14:57] Moses pick up that stick when it was a
[1:15:00] snake.
[1:15:03] And because when he put it down and
[1:15:05] became a snake, he ran. The Bible said
[1:15:06] he didn't just run, he fled from it. So
[1:15:08] that' been neat to see, you know, a man
[1:15:10] in a robe flying down the road at 80
[1:15:13] years old. And God's teached him, you're
[1:15:15] going to have to trust me. Amen. That's
[1:15:18] how God is.
[1:15:20] He gave him his word and then he tried
[1:15:21] Moses by his word. You said, "You
[1:15:23] believe me? You say you trust me?" Then
[1:15:26] pick it up.
[1:15:28] Abraham was a man of 75 years old when
[1:15:30] God called him. So often times we don't
[1:15:34] understand that the trying of the word,
[1:15:36] the trying of the word is not
[1:15:39] failure, but it's God teaching you to
[1:15:41] put your faith in the sanctuary of the
[1:15:44] word because it's the only place it can
[1:15:46] rest.
[1:15:48] Samuel was just a boy when God called
[1:15:50] him and he gave him a message to speak.
[1:15:52] And Amen. And and Samuel is like
[1:15:55] probably many of us that when he heard
[1:15:57] the voice of God, he thought it was his
[1:15:59] pastor. He thought it was his priest. He
[1:16:02] didn't understand that that voice was
[1:16:03] God speaking.
[1:16:06] Amen. He was in the right He was in the
[1:16:08] right place, but he had the wrong
[1:16:09] understanding.
[1:16:11] Amen. And he kept going back. Young
[1:16:13] people, we don't understand sometimes
[1:16:14] how how patient God is with with us to
[1:16:17] keep on calling us. That's right. And he
[1:16:20] kept calling and and he kept he kept
[1:16:22] calling to to Eli. And Eli wasn't
[1:16:24] getting and finally Eli realized, "Well,
[1:16:26] this is God calling him." And he told
[1:16:28] him, he said, "Son, you go back and lay
[1:16:31] down." I want to tell you, if perhaps or
[1:16:35] per chance, he would call you again. You
[1:16:38] see, God doesn't have to call again.
[1:16:41] But he when he does, you say, "Here am
[1:16:44] I, Lord."
[1:16:46] See, this is what this is all about
[1:16:48] tonight. It's just to talk to you about
[1:16:50] the voice of God that he is knocking at
[1:16:52] your heart. And it's just a simple
[1:16:55] response. Here am I.
[1:17:02] Brother
[1:17:04] Brandham was just a boy of seven when
[1:17:06] the angel of the Lord appeared to him in
[1:17:09] a whirlwind spoke to
[1:17:11] him. David fought a giant that full-g
[1:17:14] grown men were afraid to fight. So being
[1:17:16] full grown and being grown up is can can
[1:17:19] be a different perception sometimes.
[1:17:22] So Solomon's life at this young age
[1:17:26] pales in comparison to this man
[1:17:29] David. And in David's own words, "My son
[1:17:31] is young and
[1:17:33] tender." Application mean he's still
[1:17:36] weak.
[1:17:38] So can you imagine if you're
[1:17:40] Solomon and you have to step into those
[1:17:43] footsteps, you have to assume those
[1:17:47] responsibilities and it would seem
[1:17:49] like how can I do
[1:17:55] that? We have, as I've already said, no
[1:17:58] such record of Solomon other than his
[1:17:59] birth to David and Basheba.
[1:18:03] But there was something about his birth
[1:18:04] that was recorded about him that said
[1:18:09] the Lord loved him.
[1:18:13] I tell you the Lord loves you.
[1:18:18] And you you might say, "Well, Brother
[1:18:20] Danny, I'd just like to know if I'm in
[1:18:22] that book." I tell you, I can tell you
[1:18:24] assuredly you get in Christ, you'll find
[1:18:26] your name everywhere. Amen. They asked
[1:18:29] Brother Brandham, "With a ministry like
[1:18:31] yours, shouldn't you shouldn't your name
[1:18:32] be somewhere in the Bible?" And he says,
[1:18:35] "Your name doesn't have to be in the
[1:18:36] Bible." He said, "Just get in Christ.
[1:18:39] And if you're in Christ, you're in the
[1:18:41] Bible." In fact, he said, "If you get in
[1:18:42] Christ, you're in your full position."
[1:18:45] Yes, sir. So, that's the objective. Get
[1:18:49] in Christ. Brother Danny, how do I get
[1:18:51] in Christ? By one spirit. We're all
[1:18:54] baptized. Amen. Into that body. Praise
[1:18:57] the Lord. But the Lord had spoken about
[1:19:00] the birth of Solomon and said he loved
[1:19:04] him and that he said this boy, this man
[1:19:07] will build a house for my name. Nathan
[1:19:11] the prophet called Solomon Jediah which
[1:19:13] means beloved of the Lord. So I want you
[1:19:15] to notice this connection. It was the
[1:19:17] prophet Nathan who brought the message
[1:19:19] to to David when David has the strong
[1:19:22] desire. Do you understand? Amen. this
[1:19:26] generation had had a strong desire.
[1:19:28] David had a strong desire to build a
[1:19:31] house for the
[1:19:32] Lord. And Nathan originally said, "Do
[1:19:36] all that's in your heart, David, for the
[1:19:37] Lord is with you." But the Lord came to
[1:19:39] him that night and told him, "Amen.
[1:19:41] David will not build this
[1:19:43] house." Amen. But one that comes from
[1:19:46] him is going to build this house, but
[1:19:48] you go tell David and remind him of
[1:19:50] where I brought him from
[1:19:52] and what I have done for him.
[1:19:55] Amen. And so and when he told him, he
[1:19:58] said, "I've took you from the sheep
[1:20:00] coat. I took you from following sheep to
[1:20:02] be ruler over my people Israel. Since
[1:20:04] that time, I brought up the children of
[1:20:06] Israel out of Egypt. Even to this day,
[1:20:08] I've not dwelt in a house, but I've
[1:20:10] walked in a tent, and I've walked in a
[1:20:12] tabernacle. I was with you, David,
[1:20:14] wherever you went. And I cut off all
[1:20:16] your enemies out of your sight, and I
[1:20:18] made you a great name, like under the
[1:20:20] name of the great men that are in the
[1:20:22] earth."
[1:20:23] So God promised David that under his
[1:20:26] reign I will establish Israel. When
[1:20:29] David said, "I want to build your
[1:20:31] house," God came to David says, "No,
[1:20:33] you're not going to build my house, but
[1:20:35] I'm going to build yours."
[1:20:39] I'm going to establish my word in you.
[1:20:42] Praise the name of the
[1:20:44] Lord. Amen. So David when he he realized
[1:20:47] that, you see, God is honored. God is
[1:20:49] honored when you have these intentions
[1:20:51] to do something for him. And even though
[1:20:53] it wasn't David's place to do it, God
[1:20:55] honored him. Amen. So he told David,
[1:20:59] "There be one that'll come from you.
[1:21:01] He'll be a man of peace and he'll build
[1:21:03] a house for my name." Amen. And I will
[1:21:06] establish the throne of his kingdom
[1:21:08] forever. I'll be his father. He'll be my
[1:21:10] son. If he commit iniquity, I'll chasten
[1:21:13] him with the rod of men, with the
[1:21:15] stripes of men. But my mercy shall not
[1:21:17] depart from him, as I took it away from
[1:21:20] Saul, whom I put away from before thee.
[1:21:23] And thy house and thy kingdom shall be
[1:21:25] established forever before thee. Thy
[1:21:27] throne shall be established forever.
[1:21:30] This message that God gave to David was
[1:21:35] about five years before Solomon was even
[1:21:37] born.
[1:21:39] And God is telling David through the
[1:21:43] prophet
[1:21:44] Nathan, I love
[1:21:46] you and I love the one that's coming
[1:21:48] after
[1:21:49] you and I already know him and I already
[1:21:54] know what he's going to do. In fact, I
[1:21:55] already have a work for him to do.
[1:21:59] You understand? That's called
[1:22:01] continuation.
[1:22:02] You might think, why am I even here? I'm
[1:22:04] going to say it again. Continuation.
[1:22:07] You are the most important generation at
[1:22:09] this time right now. Amen. Because you
[1:22:12] realize if this message dies out with
[1:22:14] old men, it's a failure.
[1:22:17] Amen. We need the strength of the young
[1:22:20] people. Amen. To rise up. That's what
[1:22:23] continue means. To rise up and catch the
[1:22:26] revelation.
[1:22:30] Praise the
[1:22:31] Lord. I think about the mercy of God
[1:22:34] because I'm going to tell you something.
[1:22:35] And you're not going to accomplish
[1:22:36] anything for him without his mercy and
[1:22:39] without his grace.
[1:22:42] Cuz he doesn't want your ability. He
[1:22:43] doesn't want your talent. He'll use it,
[1:22:46] but that's not what he's wanting. He's
[1:22:47] just wanting you.
[1:22:49] You said, "Brother Danny, but I'm
[1:22:50] nothing. I have this inferiority
[1:22:52] complex." How many have inferiority
[1:22:54] complexes? Amen. Just the preachers and
[1:22:56] the deacons. That's great. We're having
[1:22:57] a good time. Amen. All you Adanas and
[1:23:00] Abselums, let's talk about it. You think
[1:23:02] you're already ready for it? Let me tell
[1:23:04] you. Amen. The older you get, sometimes
[1:23:06] the more unsure of yourself you get.
[1:23:09] Amen. Amen. I I think and and you guys
[1:23:11] forgive me for this, but I think the
[1:23:13] older I get, Amen, the less I know.
[1:23:17] Sometimes I don't even know who I
[1:23:20] am. But I think about Solomon. You
[1:23:22] understand now? The Bible puts in there
[1:23:24] for a reason Abselum and his beauty.
[1:23:28] Adinijia. Amen. Being a goodly man and
[1:23:31] pulling people after them and and all of
[1:23:34] this. So it it it was in beauty. That's
[1:23:36] how Satan always presents himself. Amen.
[1:23:39] Something beautiful to the eye.
[1:23:41] Something beautiful to how people
[1:23:43] discern today, which is by the flesh and
[1:23:45] not by the spirit
[1:23:47] or the characteristic. And yet Solomon,
[1:23:50] he hadn't said a word. The Bible doesn't
[1:23:52] record anything he says until he becomes
[1:23:56] king.
[1:23:58] But the whole time before Solomon even
[1:24:01] ascended to the throne, that previous
[1:24:04] generation, David said, "All right, if
[1:24:06] God's going to do that, and if he's
[1:24:08] going to honor me," and he went back and
[1:24:10] he prayed. I'm going tell you, this is
[1:24:11] good advice to us people. Amen. When we
[1:24:13] ask God for something, he tells us no,
[1:24:15] and he tells you what he's going to do.
[1:24:17] Go back and thank him for telling you.
[1:24:20] Go back and thank him. Say, Lord, thank
[1:24:21] you. Now, do what you said.
[1:24:24] Do your word.
[1:24:26] I'm not going to ask what I want
[1:24:27] anymore. I'm asking you to do what you
[1:24:29] promised me.
[1:24:31] Amen. And that's what David did. Do what
[1:24:33] you have said in your words. Begin to
[1:24:35] pray the way God
[1:24:38] spoke. But you know the relationship of
[1:24:41] David with Basheba started in adultery.
[1:24:44] How many know that it started in
[1:24:47] adultery and it culminated in
[1:24:51] murder. And it was only when confronted
[1:24:54] with the truth. Amen. Because David, he
[1:24:56] was just going on. He wasn't doing
[1:24:58] anything to correct it. He was trying to
[1:25:01] hide it. And maybe I'm talking to
[1:25:03] somebody here that you're in that
[1:25:05] condition right now, trying to hide
[1:25:08] something. I tell you, you can hide it
[1:25:10] from everybody in here, but you can't
[1:25:12] hide it from God.
[1:25:14] But I want you to look how God will deal
[1:25:16] with it. Amen. When he was confronted
[1:25:18] when when Nathan came into David and be
[1:25:21] to tell him a parable about a rich man.
[1:25:24] Amen. And a poor man and their sheep.
[1:25:26] And the rich man was going to have a a a
[1:25:29] feast. Amen. He took that poor man's
[1:25:31] only sheep and killed and sacrificed
[1:25:34] that and used it for his feast when he
[1:25:37] had plenty himself. He said, "David,
[1:25:39] what should happen to a man?" You know,
[1:25:41] it's real easy to judge somebody else.
[1:25:44] David said that man should
[1:25:48] die before he dies. He needs to pay
[1:25:50] everything back however many times he
[1:25:51] has to do it.
[1:25:54] You know what Nathan turn around says?
[1:25:55] You're the man, David. Amen. David being
[1:25:57] a man after God's own heart knew how to
[1:25:59] repent. You know what the zeal of this
[1:26:01] hour is? To repent. Amen. What is
[1:26:04] repent, brother Danny? It says, "I'm
[1:26:05] sorry." Tell God, "I'm sorry. I'm
[1:26:08] sorry." And David knew how to do that.
[1:26:11] And when he done that, Amen. God forgave
[1:26:14] him. Go read Psalms 51.
[1:26:19] He forgave him. How can then God look
[1:26:23] down through what looks like a twisted
[1:26:25] mess and say, "Through that
[1:26:27] relationship, I'm going to build my
[1:26:29] house."
[1:26:32] Perhaps that's why we don't hear nothing
[1:26:34] about Solomon before he takes the throne
[1:26:36] because he knows what grace is about.
[1:26:39] Because that house was built by grace,
[1:26:42] not by politics.
[1:26:44] Come on, church. Amen. We hear a whole
[1:26:46] lot from Abselum talking before he
[1:26:48] become king. We hear a whole lot about
[1:26:50] Adinijah talking before he become or
[1:26:52] tried to become king. Amen. But we hear
[1:26:54] nothing from Solomon because he knew
[1:26:58] what grace was. Amen.
[1:27:01] And he knew he couldn't put himself in
[1:27:03] anyhow. Amen. That if he's even in it,
[1:27:05] God's the one that put him in it. Amen.
[1:27:08] How can it's not by my will and it's not
[1:27:10] by my flesh. Amen. But it has to be God.
[1:27:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:27:16] David's actions cause the sword to be in
[1:27:18] his house because in God's own words,
[1:27:20] David had despied the despised the
[1:27:22] commandments of the Lord. Amen. But
[1:27:25] David realizes what he's done and with
[1:27:27] the and it what he realized brought a
[1:27:29] great repentance. You see, young people,
[1:27:31] God is always teaching us by his word.
[1:27:33] We cannot sweep our actions under the
[1:27:36] rug and think there's no consequences.
[1:27:38] But there are consequences. But true
[1:27:41] repentance brings grace. Amen. Amen.
[1:27:46] And this is that Solomon who comes from
[1:27:48] a relationship of grace. Brother
[1:27:51] Brandham said things that are to be you
[1:27:53] are pre-planned by God. Nothing happens
[1:27:56] by chance with God. He knows all about
[1:27:58] it. It's all pre-planned for many
[1:28:01] generations back that you would be here
[1:28:05] tonight.
[1:28:07] I believe we can repeat it again. Amen.
[1:28:10] That it was all pre-planned by God. He
[1:28:13] knew you would be here tonight. Praise
[1:28:16] the Lord. For Solomon, the kingship is a
[1:28:22] revelation. For the others, it's
[1:28:24] ambition and it's entitlement. Amen.
[1:28:26] Revelation does not bring ambition and
[1:28:29] entitlement. Revelation brings grace.
[1:28:35] Hallelujah.
[1:28:38] The others may look like kings, but
[1:28:41] Solomon has election.
[1:28:53] This
[1:28:54] drive to build a house for the presence
[1:28:57] of the
[1:28:59] Lord so that his presence can dwell
[1:29:03] there. Solomon is here for a special
[1:29:05] purpose.
[1:29:07] I want to build a house. You are
[1:29:10] predestined to build God a
[1:29:12] house. Can you
[1:29:14] imagine? Well, how am I going to build a
[1:29:17] house? You already said before the
[1:29:20] public, I'm weak and tender. In private,
[1:29:22] when you're dying, you tell me be a man.
[1:29:25] Isn't that great to have a youth banquet
[1:29:26] and I just, hey y'all, be man. Grow up.
[1:29:31] But he wasn't rebuking him. He's telling
[1:29:33] him come to your position. Amen. God has
[1:29:37] something for you.
[1:29:40] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:42] So don't resent the planning of the
[1:29:44] Lord. Don't resent that he's planned for
[1:29:46] you to be here tonight when it looks
[1:29:48] like the preacher is just scolding you
[1:29:50] or telling you what to do. It's actually
[1:29:51] the planning of God. Amen. For your
[1:29:55] life, sir. He places the word before you
[1:29:58] so that you might
[1:30:00] rise to the height of it.
[1:30:05] Amen. Up to this point, as we've already
[1:30:08] said, we do not see any input from
[1:30:10] Solomon. Every everybody else is busy
[1:30:13] planning for
[1:30:15] him. Ephesians 2:8 says, "For by grace
[1:30:18] are you saved through faith." Can you
[1:30:19] say amen? Not of yourself. It is a gift
[1:30:24] of God, not of works, lest any man
[1:30:27] should boast. But we are his
[1:30:30] workmanship,
[1:30:32] created in Christ Jesus. Don't resent
[1:30:34] his planning. Come on. Unto good works.
[1:30:38] But think about what these good works
[1:30:40] are which God hath before ordained. He's
[1:30:43] already ordained good works that you
[1:30:45] should walk in. So what are they? Get in
[1:30:47] Christ. Amen. The good works are in him.
[1:30:52] Brother Brandham said this modern
[1:30:55] events. Everybody doing okay? I won't be
[1:30:58] much longer. If you're a son or daughter
[1:31:00] of God, you're in God all the time. But
[1:31:03] he knew what bed in time you would be
[1:31:05] planted. So now you're made a creature
[1:31:08] of God, a son of God, a manifested son
[1:31:10] or daughter of God to meet the challenge
[1:31:13] of the hour. God needs some young man.
[1:31:17] He needs some young woman even even
[1:31:20] sometimes simply to stand up and say I'm
[1:31:22] a woman.
[1:31:23] Amen. I'm a man. He needs somebody.
[1:31:28] Amen. To be in the community that looks
[1:31:31] like what he formed. Somebody that looks
[1:31:34] like the image of God. Somebody that
[1:31:36] looks like what he had in his mind. What
[1:31:39] he planned to be here. Somebody that
[1:31:41] looks like a Christian.
[1:31:44] Well, I I know the skit. I know what
[1:31:45] you're thinking. Well, just looking like
[1:31:47] it is not enough. No, but if there's
[1:31:49] something that's attracting the people
[1:31:50] to how you look, then there should be
[1:31:52] something living in you that can answer
[1:31:54] it, right? Praise the Lord. Why? He
[1:31:57] said, "We are here to meet the challenge
[1:31:59] of the this hour to vindicate the true
[1:32:01] and living God of this hour." How many
[1:32:04] want to do that?
[1:32:06] Another thing about Solomon, you say, "I
[1:32:09] don't know what I'm here to do." Solomon
[1:32:10] was called to deal with problems that
[1:32:12] came from David's generation. And David
[1:32:15] said, "I'm not going to be the one to
[1:32:16] deal with it. You're going to be the one
[1:32:18] to deal with it." You realize we're
[1:32:19] dealing with spirits from previous
[1:32:21] generations that have come up in this
[1:32:23] time. And God said, "I trust you, the
[1:32:25] weak ones, the indecisive ones." Amen. I
[1:32:28] see something in you though nobody else
[1:32:30] has seen and it's not even on record.
[1:32:31] But there's wisdom in you. Amen. To know
[1:32:34] the God of your fathers.
[1:32:37] Praise the Lord. So, he's called to deal
[1:32:39] with that. God wants you to do the same
[1:32:42] thing.
[1:32:45] Hallelujah.
[1:32:47] Amen. When David was
[1:32:50] publicly publicly
[1:32:53] coronating Solomon to be king, 1st
[1:32:56] Chronicles 28, he he told Solomon this.
[1:32:58] Said, Solomon, my son, know thou the God
[1:33:02] of your father and serve him with all
[1:33:05] your
[1:33:06] heart. I want to I want to I want to I
[1:33:10] want to help you young people in this.
[1:33:12] Know the God of our
[1:33:14] fathers. Know him. See what his
[1:33:17] character is. See what his ways is. Know
[1:33:19] what he has to say. Cuz when situations
[1:33:22] begin to rise among us, Amen. then you
[1:33:24] won't be so surprised cuz you know God's
[1:33:27] already talked about it.
[1:33:31] Amen. Solomon was tasked to build a
[1:33:33] temporary place of such glory and
[1:33:36] expense that everything thereafter be
[1:33:38] compared to that building. Yet that was
[1:33:40] not God's desire to dwell in a house
[1:33:44] made with
[1:33:45] hands. He said, "I I I'm not going to
[1:33:48] dwell." Stephen said, as he preached
[1:33:50] that Acts 7, he said, "Can God dwell in
[1:33:52] a house made with hands?" No. He wants
[1:33:54] to dwell in a house he made.
[1:33:59] And ye are the temple of God.
[1:34:04] Paul would say in Ephesians 2, "You're
[1:34:05] the habitation of God through the
[1:34:08] spirit.
[1:34:09] That's his temple. That's where he's at
[1:34:12] right now. That's where he's dwelling.
[1:34:14] Well, what is Brother Danny? What is my
[1:34:16] job? I'm going to tell you what your job
[1:34:17] is. Brother Brandham said, "As kings and
[1:34:20] priests," he said, "we are kings and
[1:34:22] priests to bring in the Messiah."
[1:34:26] You have the biggest job on
[1:34:29] earth and that is to bring other people
[1:34:33] into the presence of the
[1:34:36] king. And the king is not a man on earth
[1:34:42] but it's the king of glory and he wants
[1:34:44] to use you. That's the treasure in you
[1:34:47] is to bring you into the presence of the
[1:34:49] Messiah. Just a couple more
[1:34:51] things. Most dangerous things a preacher
[1:34:53] can say.
[1:34:54] Right in the story of David and Solomon,
[1:34:58] the Bible shows us a beautiful portion
[1:35:00] of scripture to read that he has
[1:35:01] prepared extensively for Solomon's work.
[1:35:05] Solomon did not come to the throne when
[1:35:07] his his father told him, "Be a man and I
[1:35:10] charge you to walk in the ways of God so
[1:35:12] that the word of God can continue." He
[1:35:15] did not bring him to that hour with no
[1:35:19] resources. Amen. But at the time that
[1:35:22] Solomon became king, his father was very
[1:35:26] rich. Men have tried to estimate how
[1:35:28] wealthy David was. His wealth was
[1:35:31] anywhere from 300 to 800 billion dollars
[1:35:34] in today's money. Now that's that's a
[1:35:36] pretty big gap in what could be, right?
[1:35:40] 300 to
[1:35:42] 800. David, the Bible says in gold alone
[1:35:45] contributed of his own wealth $300
[1:35:48] billion to build the temple, which the
[1:35:51] worth of the temple was that that
[1:35:53] Solomon built was around $350 billion.
[1:35:57] You ever been in a building that
[1:35:58] expensive? So basically, the Bible's
[1:36:01] telling us Solomon has unlimited wealth
[1:36:04] backing him
[1:36:06] up. God did not put him in that position
[1:36:09] with no resources to fulfill it. God has
[1:36:13] unlimited resources tonight. He has
[1:36:16] resources of strength. He has resources
[1:36:19] of grace. He has resources of mercy, the
[1:36:22] Holy Ghost power to fulfill the job
[1:36:25] unlimited. In fact, the prophet would
[1:36:28] say every soul in here is worth
[1:36:32] 10,000 worlds. Can anybody tell you how
[1:36:34] much worth that is? Well, that's why
[1:36:37] there's such a big gap. They really
[1:36:38] don't know the worth. 300 800 billion.
[1:36:42] He said the net worth of Solomon at his
[1:36:45] richest peak was in between two or three
[1:36:47] trillion dollars. How many could handle
[1:36:50] that? And that don't even excite you. I
[1:36:53] don't know what else to say.
[1:36:55] Amen. But let me tell you, God is trying
[1:36:58] to show you something. Amen. The value
[1:37:01] that he puts on is what the spiritual
[1:37:04] worth is. A soul is worth 10,000
[1:37:08] worlds. And here's God's telling them,
[1:37:11] these men in the natural had unlimited
[1:37:13] resources. In fact, one one historian
[1:37:16] said, David at that time had half of the
[1:37:19] gold on the planet in his
[1:37:21] treasury. He had a lot of money. He
[1:37:24] fought a lot of wars. He got a lot of
[1:37:27] tribute. He got a lot of spoil. I want
[1:37:29] to tell you, our heavenly father has had
[1:37:31] generations. He's had amen thousands of
[1:37:35] years fighting wars. You understand the
[1:37:37] weapons in the treasury of David is
[1:37:39] still open. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:37:44] Paul would say in Ephesians 3:7,
[1:37:47] "Whereof I was made a minister according
[1:37:49] to the gift of the grace of God given
[1:37:51] unto me by the effectual working of his
[1:37:53] power unto me who am the less than the
[1:37:56] least of all saints is this grace given
[1:37:59] that I should preach among the Gentiles,
[1:38:02] the unsearchable."
[1:38:05] See, you can think it's worth this much.
[1:38:07] You I just want to say
[1:38:09] this. When Jesus
[1:38:12] came, the religious world at that time
[1:38:15] put his
[1:38:17] worth at 30 pieces of
[1:38:24] silver. That's the worth they put on
[1:38:29] God. He turns around and puts on
[1:38:31] you
[1:38:34] 10,000 worlds. You're worth so much that
[1:38:38] it was only
[1:38:40] him that could get you.
[1:38:46] Young people, I don't know what you've
[1:38:48] been through. I don't know what your
[1:38:50] situations are at home. You all look
[1:38:52] nice tonight, but I know home can be
[1:38:56] some of the loneliest places to live.
[1:38:59] your minds, the battlefield of your
[1:39:03] mind, and the enemy begins to tell you,
[1:39:06] "You're not worth
[1:39:09] anything. You're not worth
[1:39:12] anything. You've had so much taken from
[1:39:14] you. You've you've given up so much and
[1:39:17] you've heard the preaching and you're
[1:39:18] not measuring up to that. You're not
[1:39:20] worth anything." I want to tell you
[1:39:23] something. He's lying to you. Amen. God
[1:39:26] has already said what you're worth.
[1:39:28] Amen. Amen.
[1:39:32] And his worth was he came himself.
[1:39:35] And that's why tonight we can preach the
[1:39:37] unsearchable riches of Christ. It's not
[1:39:39] 300 to 800 billions. It's not two or
[1:39:41] three trillion. It's unsearchable.
[1:39:43] You're never reaching. You know why?
[1:39:44] Because my father owns a cattle on a
[1:39:47] thousand hills. And not only that, he's
[1:39:48] the one that makes gold. So if gold runs
[1:39:50] out here, just make more. It's
[1:39:52] unsearchable. It'll never run out. Let
[1:39:55] me just tell you something. Mercy will
[1:39:57] never run away from you. It'll follow
[1:39:59] after you. Goodness will follow after
[1:40:01] you. We have resources behind us to put
[1:40:05] us on the throne
[1:40:09] and to fulfill the word of God. Amen.
[1:40:15] One more quote and I I'll close. When
[1:40:18] you realize what are we doing here?
[1:40:21] Where do we come from?
[1:40:24] What business do we have being here?
[1:40:26] We're not put here by chance. We're put
[1:40:28] here for a purpose. And we must serve
[1:40:30] that
[1:40:31] purpose. Still, we're back on the basis
[1:40:33] of free moral agency where we can serve
[1:40:36] God or we can reject it. Just like Adam
[1:40:39] did in the beginning. Brother Brandon
[1:40:41] began to commend those that played the
[1:40:43] piano and those that stood up and sang.
[1:40:45] He said, "I'm looking at that little
[1:40:46] lady playing the piano. I was hearing
[1:40:48] them as they sang and we were talking
[1:40:49] about them on the road here. a little
[1:40:51] family that dedicated their whole life
[1:40:53] and everything to Christ. And look at
[1:40:55] how orderly that family is. Look at
[1:40:57] those little girls, their their example
[1:40:59] of young womanhood of of
[1:41:02] teenagers. He said, and and he and he
[1:41:05] begins to say where he was in New York
[1:41:06] and he'd got and there said it was a
[1:41:08] city block full of beatnicks, the girls
[1:41:10] down there with leotards on and nothing
[1:41:12] but little bikinis or whatever over the
[1:41:14] top of it. Oh, it was just he said they
[1:41:17] do anything in their mind and no matter
[1:41:18] what it is, he said it's beatnick. They
[1:41:20] can do anything. If they want to lay
[1:41:23] down and don't get up, they lay down and
[1:41:24] they don't get up. If they want to do a
[1:41:26] certain thing, they do it. If they
[1:41:27] don't, they don't. Their mind is just
[1:41:30] traveling. What does the unconverted
[1:41:32] mind come to? You have no right to do
[1:41:34] that cuz you're not your own. You're
[1:41:36] bought with a price. You're bought by
[1:41:38] deity, Jesus Christ, the son of God made
[1:41:41] flesh. But it's a conglomeration of sin.
[1:41:44] You see? But these young girls, they
[1:41:46] like that that dedicated their lives to
[1:41:49] Christ, they stand out to me in this
[1:41:51] time of darkness. It's a fork light.
[1:41:54] It's a zigzag whip of God in the skies
[1:41:56] to show there can be light. There can be
[1:41:59] righteousness in the midst of sin.
[1:42:02] Praise the Lord. Mary, the mother of
[1:42:05] Jesus, in the city of Nazareth, the
[1:42:07] meanest city in the land, but out of
[1:42:08] there, God chose a little lady about 15
[1:42:11] years old. How many 15 year olds we have
[1:42:14] here tonight? Boys, don't raise your
[1:42:16] hand. Talking about girls. Come on,
[1:42:19] somebody.
[1:42:22] Nobody. Oh my. Where? One, two. Amen. 15
[1:42:29] year old
[1:42:30] girls. Amen. And God chose that
[1:42:34] girl. Amen. To be an incubator.
[1:42:38] Amen. For Jehovah.
[1:42:42] And not only that, she had to say a
[1:42:44] certain thing back to Gabriel. How can
[1:42:47] this happen? How can this be? He said,
[1:42:48] 'The Holy Ghost will overshadow me,
[1:42:50] overshadow you. And she said, be it unto
[1:42:53] me according to thy word. You see,
[1:42:55] that's what he's looking for from us.
[1:42:57] Just to agree with him. Amen. If you ask
[1:43:00] how can it happen, don't say I don't
[1:43:02] believe it can happen. Say how can it
[1:43:04] happen? Here, tell you.
[1:43:07] Amen. God works through human beings to
[1:43:11] redeem human
[1:43:12] beings. He can take you, he can work
[1:43:16] through you to redeem humanity if you
[1:43:19] completely dedicate everything you are.
[1:43:22] If you're a young woman, dedicate your
[1:43:24] morals. If you're a young man, dedicate
[1:43:27] your morals. Dedicate your mind.
[1:43:28] Dedicate your thinking. Dedicate your
[1:43:30] heart. Dedicate your soul. Dedicate all
[1:43:33] you
[1:43:34] are. and let Christ work through that.
[1:43:38] What a glorious things. You got rivers
[1:43:40] to cross. You got bridges to go over.
[1:43:43] You got brier patches. You got thickets.
[1:43:45] You got woods. You got dark places. You
[1:43:47] got high hills. You got high climbs. And
[1:43:50] what are you doing someday? You're stand
[1:43:52] and look back and see where you come
[1:43:54] from. And you're going to be judged by
[1:43:57] the course you take. Put your mind and
[1:43:59] your thought on the north star, the
[1:44:01] center of God. Don't move from it. Stay
[1:44:04] right with it. How many say that's my
[1:44:07] desire? That's what I want. Look at all
[1:44:10] the hands of you young people. Is that
[1:44:11] in vain? Are you raising your hands in
[1:44:13] vain? Or is God seeing it? I believe
[1:44:15] he's seeing it. I believe he sees your
[1:44:17] heart. I believe he sees the desire
[1:44:18] there. I don't believe it's in vain. In
[1:44:21] fact, amen. The prophet said it's an act
[1:44:22] that goes against gravity.
[1:44:26] There's something in you says, "Yes,
[1:44:27] that's what I want to be." I'm not
[1:44:28] raising my hand just because somebody
[1:44:30] else is looking. I'm raising my hand
[1:44:31] because that's the desire of my heart.
[1:44:34] And I want to thank God tonight. Amen. I
[1:44:36] may feel overshadowed by the warriors
[1:44:38] before me, but I realize those warriors
[1:44:40] that came before me can't do what I can
[1:44:42] do. They're not called to do what I can
[1:44:45] do. Amen. He called me to do
[1:44:48] it. And I want to say, Lord, use me.
[1:44:51] Let's stand
[1:44:54] together. Blessed be the name of the
[1:44:56] Lord.
[1:45:02] Amen. Aren't you thankful for a father
[1:45:06] with unlimited resources?
[1:45:10] I'm thankful for a God that said, "I'm
[1:45:12] not going to leave you alone in this
[1:45:13] age." But you got all the power of
[1:45:17] heaven behind you here at this
[1:45:19] time. Draw from it. Draw from it.
[1:45:24] Heavenly
[1:45:25] Father, we love you,
[1:45:27] Lord. We pray that you would take your
[1:45:30] word just now. The things that been
[1:45:33] spoken and establish it in the hearts of
[1:45:36] those that have listened.
[1:45:38] Father, one person, two person, many
[1:45:41] more than that raise their
[1:45:43] hand. May the enemy's taunted them and
[1:45:45] say there's there's nothing to
[1:45:48] you. In fact, even your own church,
[1:45:50] hardly anybody knows anything about you.
[1:45:53] Don't you know he knows
[1:45:55] you? He loves
[1:45:57] you. He's here to talk to
[1:46:01] you. What's that little voice in your
[1:46:04] heart telling
[1:46:05] you? Just turn to
[1:46:08] me. Follow
[1:46:10] me. Come follow
[1:46:14] me. You're so gracious, Lord, out of
[1:46:17] your great
[1:46:19] resources to give them of your riches.
[1:46:22] all the riches of your
[1:46:24] grace, the riches of your mercy, the
[1:46:27] riches of your
[1:46:29] love. And we want to know you. We want
[1:46:31] to know you. You in the depth, into the
[1:46:33] breadth and the height. We want to know
[1:46:35] you. Lord, bless these people tonight.
[1:46:38] Bless all the efforts that have been
[1:46:40] made. And may
[1:46:42] Father, you just commune with them as
[1:46:45] they go home.
[1:46:48] and Lord that there will be a harvest of
[1:46:51] the things that have been done here
[1:46:52] tonight. For we ask it in the name of
[1:46:55] Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you.
[1:46:58] [Music]
[1:47:04] Amen. Can we say praise the
[1:47:08] Lord? How many wants God to be able to
[1:47:11] use you for whatever
[1:47:14] capacity he's called you to be?
[1:47:17] And our way of thinking looks like it'd
[1:47:19] been better off if he had had David and
[1:47:22] Samson and maybe some of those great
[1:47:25] people. But God knows how to place each
[1:47:27] of
[1:47:29] us. No matter what your age is, what you
[1:47:33] think you can do or cannot do, what's
[1:47:35] really important is is that we find what
[1:47:38] he knows is ordained us to do.
[1:47:42] I want to say before we go, we so
[1:47:44] appreciate the sermon tonight. Brother
[1:47:47] Danny, thank you my brother. Um, also
[1:47:50] want to say how much we appreciate all
[1:47:51] the effort that's been put forth and all
[1:47:54] this to make it look so
[1:47:56] beautiful. The sanctuary from the church
[1:47:59] been working on it for several
[1:48:01] weeks. Certainly appreciate the food.
[1:48:03] Did you enjoy the food? We appreciate
[1:48:06] all those that served us. We thank thank
[1:48:08] them for doing that. All those that are
[1:48:11] willing to come and and share that with
[1:48:14] us tonight. We thank you. Let's just
[1:48:17] pray
[1:48:18] [Music]
[1:48:19] together. Heavenly Father, there may be
[1:48:23] some here tonight that feels like
[1:48:27] they're hardly
[1:48:29] anything. What could they do? What could
[1:48:31] they
[1:48:32] say? when the lives of great men all
[1:48:35] remind us that we can make our lives
[1:48:39] sublime. So Lord, we feel
[1:48:43] inferior. Your way of doing things is so
[1:48:46] different to us. You had a great man by
[1:48:48] the name of Abraham and another great
[1:48:51] man by the name of
[1:48:53] Jacob and then just a mediocre type of
[1:48:56] man by the name of Isaac.
[1:49:00] Not near as much written about his life,
[1:49:02] not near as many great events written
[1:49:04] about
[1:49:05] him, but yet in his life, you hid the
[1:49:09] mystery of yourself and your Rebecca
[1:49:14] bride. So Lord, may we not just be
[1:49:17] overwhelmed by those that have gone
[1:49:19] before us and maybe even ones that we
[1:49:22] look at today that are such mighty men
[1:49:25] or mighty women. But may we become what
[1:49:29] you have in your mind for us, Father.
[1:49:32] Each young man, each young
[1:49:34] woman, those of us that have been in
[1:49:37] this war for many, many years. But Lord,
[1:49:41] we also still have that same
[1:49:43] desire. Help us tonight, Father, as we
[1:49:47] depart from this place tonight. May your
[1:49:48] blessings be upon our lives as we gather
[1:49:51] again in the morning to hear what you've
[1:49:53] got on your mind for us, Lord. Amen. And
[1:49:56] again on Sunday, we're looking for a
[1:49:58] great time, a great visitation of your
[1:50:02] presence. Would you grant it, Lord, in
[1:50:05] Jesus
[1:50:07] [Music]
[1:50:11] name? Well, we'd love to thank you all.
[1:50:14] Please have a seat for one second. Just
[1:50:15] a couple of announcements to finish us
[1:50:17] up. We do have the photo booth still
[1:50:19] going, so make sure you get your
[1:50:20] pictures there. We also have some
[1:50:22] t-shirts. If you would like a t-shirt or
[1:50:24] a sweatshirt, we have that by the photo
[1:50:25] booth as well. And we look forward to uh
[1:50:28] to at the pavilion. The pavilion we're
[1:50:30] going to have some ice cream. Tony is
[1:50:32] working the ice cream. Some nachos and
[1:50:34] some things that we can enjoy and
[1:50:35] fellowship together. And as I look
[1:50:37] around all these things and the sermon
[1:50:39] and the nest, getting that nest up there
[1:50:41] is
[1:50:42] amazing. Now you can stand up, take a
[1:50:45] look around, look at the other people.
[1:50:47] All right, go ahead everybody. Stand up.
[1:50:50] Take a look
[1:50:51] around. And what we wanted to share with
[1:50:53] you tonight is to tell you from the
[1:50:55] servants that are cleaning up in the
[1:50:56] back that are served that served you all
[1:50:58] night from the ministry that was here as
[1:51:00] well is that what we tried to convey to
[1:51:02] you and I think I hope came through you
[1:51:04] to your heart is that we love you. We
[1:51:06] love you very very much. Do not take
[1:51:08] that for granted. That is not in the
[1:51:10] world. What from one that came to the
[1:51:12] message at 35 years old that is not in
[1:51:14] the world. There is nothing there for
[1:51:16] you. And we love you and we hope you
[1:51:18] have a wonderful fellowship time
[1:51:19] tonight. be happy in the Lord. And I
[1:51:21] mean that little bear over there says we
[1:51:23] love you. This nest says we love you. Do
[1:51:25] you know what it took to get that up
[1:51:26] there? Big forklift thing. Okay. So
[1:51:30] recognize that we love you. We want you
[1:51:31] to have a wonderful time and continue
[1:51:33] this weekend tomorrow's service at
[1:51:38] 11. I should have looked that up and put
[1:51:40] that in my notes. I It's 11. And we're
[1:51:42] going to have a wonderful time in the
[1:51:43] Lord. God bless you all. And you're
[1:51:45] welcome to fellowship in here as well.
[1:51:47] and then we'll see you at the pavilion
[1:51:48] too if you're so inclined. We couldn't
[1:51:50] do the bonfire. There was a a fire uh
[1:51:52] hazard thing and so we're going to
[1:51:55] fellowship with nachos instead. All
[1:51:56] right. God bless you all. Thank you.
[1:51:59] [Applause]
