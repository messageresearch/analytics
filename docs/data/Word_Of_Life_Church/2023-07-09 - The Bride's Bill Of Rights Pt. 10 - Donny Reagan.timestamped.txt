[40:39] and I told Brother uh Louis that I
[40:42] didn't have a button in my mouth I had
[40:43] an m m
[40:47] but I'm sure that everyone in this
[40:50] congregation
[40:52] could and would give a heartfelt
[40:56] appreciation to brother Donnie and
[40:58] sister Carol on this special weekend
[41:01] that they're celebrating their 50th
[41:03] wedding anniversary and their birthday
[41:07] since we can't do that I guess I've been
[41:10] selected to
[41:11] as a representative to try to express
[41:14] that love and appreciation to both of
[41:16] them
[41:17] I know that brother Donnie and sister
[41:19] Carol they don't like a lot of Praise or
[41:22] attention thrown their way
[41:24] but that's just part of the humility
[41:25] that we've grown to to to love and
[41:29] admire about them
[41:32] you know brother Donnie
[41:34] as my pastor and my friend
[41:39] you have been the most influential
[41:41] person in my life
[41:45] I've
[41:47] worked very close with brother Donnie
[41:49] for the past 36 years as a deacon
[41:53] and I've seen some of the ins and outs
[41:57] ups and downs
[41:59] trying situations
[42:01] Corrections Restorations Grace
[42:06] and during all that time and during all
[42:09] those years
[42:10] I've never seen one time not one time
[42:15] that it's not been the character of a
[42:18] son of God
[42:19] he's always led by an example
[42:23] and that's what so impressed me about
[42:25] him
[42:27] I know in the very beginning
[42:30] that
[42:32] we didn't have a pastor at Happy Valley
[42:36] and I kept calling brother Donnie and
[42:38] asking me would he come and hold a
[42:39] service for us would he come and preach
[42:41] he would come and he would preach
[42:44] he'd go back to Kentucky
[42:46] I'd call him again I'd say brother
[42:48] Donnie would you come and hold a service
[42:50] for us
[42:52] he would come
[42:54] hold the service go back to Kentucky but
[42:57] I could tell always that his heart was
[42:59] on that little church in that little
[43:00] church in Kentucky
[43:02] but God had a a greater plan God had a
[43:06] bigger plan
[43:07] and he was squeezing brother Donny's
[43:09] heart to leave that church and come to a
[43:12] church that was in
[43:14] tremendous tremendous need
[43:17] and probably during one of those times
[43:20] when God was squeezing his heart and he
[43:23] was struggling or perplexed about it
[43:26] I gave him a call one day
[43:29] and asked him would he come and
[43:31] Minister for us a service
[43:35] and and I'm sure it was during that
[43:38] struggle that he was having he got a
[43:39] little ill with me he chooses to forget
[43:42] that day
[43:45] but he got a little ill with me I'm sure
[43:47] because of the perplexion he was going
[43:49] through and he said why you keep calling
[43:51] me
[43:54] and my answer to him was
[43:57] I believe pricked his heart I told him I
[43:59] said brother Donnie
[44:07] we're a church in great great need
[44:11] and if we don't have some help we'll
[44:13] perish
[44:15] I could tell immediately his demeanor
[44:18] changed and he said when when do you
[44:19] want me to come
[44:23] I want to
[44:26] thank him for obeying God
[44:29] you know
[44:31] I'll never forget those times brother
[44:32] Donnie and I'll never forget the pain
[44:34] and the courage it took for you to leave
[44:37] and obey God
[44:39] [Music]
[44:42] there's a song that says
[44:47] when words fail us listen to our heart
[44:52] and I know this entire congregation
[44:56] words would fail us brother Donnie
[44:58] sister Carol
[45:00] but if there's some way that you could
[45:02] hear our hearts some way possible that
[45:04] you could hear it
[45:06] our hearts would be screaming to you
[45:08] that we love you
[45:28] foreign
[45:44] scream out honor and appreciation for
[45:46] you
[45:47] and what you mean to us
[45:52] and we'd be thanking you Lord for
[45:58] all the labor
[46:00] all the studying
[46:02] that you've done to bring us Rapture
[46:04] readiness
[46:08] all the prayers
[46:11] all the requests for prayer in the
[46:13] middle of the night we Heirs of the
[46:15] morning all the sacrifices that you've
[46:17] made
[46:18] sacrifices from your family that you've
[46:21] sacrificed for our our flock here
[46:25] but I want to say brother Donnie sister
[46:28] Carol that this entire congregation will
[46:30] be standing at attention
[46:32] with great apprehension and great
[46:38] expectation
[46:42] when your name is called
[46:47] and those great rewards are handed out
[46:52] it'll be a time for us to Rejoice with
[46:54] you
[46:56] I just want you to know that you have
[46:59] her love and you have our hearts
[47:03] [Applause]
[47:20] I sure couldn't add anything to that
[47:22] but there's a couple things I've learned
[47:24] about Brother Louie and both of them is
[47:26] you don't tell him no
[47:30] because he'll get you one way or the
[47:32] other so you might as well just go ahead
[47:33] and do it
[47:34] I'd like to say that uh
[47:36] I think brother Donald Institute Carol
[47:38] for all their sacrifice what
[47:40] uh
[47:42] thought this morning I didn't put a lot
[47:43] of thoughts you know me I don't talk
[47:44] good so
[47:46] Paul said follow me as I follow Christ
[47:53] I would say for everyone of us sitting
[47:56] here
[47:57] we have no excuse
[48:00] we can't say well that man didn't tell
[48:02] me and or that man didn't live it or I
[48:06] saw this or that
[48:08] we have a great opportunity here
[48:11] but we also faced with truth that we
[48:15] don't have any excuse
[48:17] and
[48:18] uh I can't sing but I can sing better
[48:21] and I can talk so key of G
[48:23] yeah
[48:24] uh as brother JD just said I want to be
[48:28] by grace
[48:30] on me standing close
[48:34] when this is not a dream that a song was
[48:36] wrote about but it's a reality
[48:41] dreamed I went to heaven
[48:45] you were there with me
[48:47] [Music]
[48:49] we walked upon the streets of gold
[48:53] beside the crystal sea
[48:58] heard the angels singing
[49:02] someone called your name
[49:05] [Music]
[49:06] turned and saw a young man
[49:09] he was smiling as he came
[49:15] he said friend you may not know me now
[49:20] then he said but wait
[49:24] years to teach my son to school
[49:28] when I was only eight
[49:31] [Music]
[49:33] every week you would say a prayer before
[49:37] the class would start
[49:40] [Music]
[49:41] one day when you said that prayer I
[49:45] asked Jesus in my heart
[49:52] thank you
[49:54] forgiving to the Lord
[49:58] [Music]
[49:59] I am alive that was
[50:03] changed
[50:08] thank you
[50:10] forgiving to the Lord
[50:15] I am so glad you gave
[50:20] [Music]
[50:26] then another man stood before you
[50:29] [Music]
[50:31] said Remember the Time
[50:34] a missionary came to your church
[50:38] his pictures made you cry
[50:42] you didn't have much money but you gave
[50:47] it anyway
[50:49] [Music]
[50:54] Jesus
[50:58] [Music]
[51:02] thank you for giving to the Lord
[51:07] [Music]
[51:09] I am alive that was changed
[51:16] thank you for giving to the Lord
[51:24] I am so glad you came
[51:31] one by one they came
[51:35] as far as he I could see
[51:39] each life somehow touched
[51:42] by your generosity
[51:47] the little things that you had done all
[51:51] the sacrifices you made
[51:55] unnoticed on the earth
[51:58] in heaven now proclaimed
[52:02] [Music]
[52:05] I know up in heaven
[52:08] you're not supposed to cry
[52:13] I am almost sure
[52:16] there were Tears In Your Eyes
[52:20] as Jesus took your hand
[52:24] you stood before the Lord
[52:28] he said my child look around you
[52:33] great is your reward
[52:38] can you help me
[52:43] thank you
[52:47] [Music]
[52:50] I am alive
[52:53] that was changed
[52:59] [Music]
[53:01] for giving to the Lord
[53:05] [Music]
[53:07] I am so glad you came
[53:15] I am so glad you came
[53:21] [Music]
[53:25] [Applause]

[53:41] bow Reds together

[54:43] to be able to hear you say those words

[55:08] or weaknesses and
[55:11] times when it felt like we couldn't go

[55:38] Lord God I pray for this prayer calls
[55:41] that I have
[55:43] Lord Brother Joel receiving this request
[55:46] for this young man I looked at his
[55:48] picture that he sent me I thought poor
[55:50] little guy
[55:51] dealing with this thing nothing but the
[55:53] devil to attack his body
[55:55] but in the name of Jesus May the spirit
[55:58] of God move forward
[56:00] every other need and requests that
[56:02] you're today

[56:09] amen
[56:12] well I'm just happy to be the house of
[56:14] the Lord
[56:16] [Applause]
[56:24] it's good to be a Christian isn't it
[56:30] let's turn to the Book of Romans if you
[56:31] would chapter 8 today
[56:34] and while you're turning there let me
[56:37] get through all the birthdays and all
[56:39] that sort of thing
[56:40] I want to wish Ashley and Courtney a
[56:42] happy birthday on Friday
[56:45] I like to wish Carol a happy 50th
[56:49] wedding anniversary yesterday I'd like
[56:53] to wish Carol a happy birthday today
[56:56] I'll not tell you how old she is
[56:59] I'd also like to wear Scotty my
[57:01] son-in-law happy birthday tomorrow
[57:04] I also like to wish Emma and Ellie a
[57:07] happy birthday tomorrow and anybody else
[57:11] that's here
[57:15] God bless you so when I forget this week
[57:18] I'm in big trouble
[57:20] [Music]
[57:21] in big trouble
[57:24] Romans chapter 8 verse 16.
[57:33] the spirit itself Bears the witness with
[57:36] our spirit
[57:38] isn't that awesome
[57:40] the spirit itself bearth a witness with
[57:43] our spirit
[57:45] that we are the children of God
[57:49] and if children then heirs
[57:52] Heirs of God and join heirs with Christ
[57:57] if wow what a big little word
[58:02] if
[58:03] so be
[58:05] that we suffer with him
[58:08] that we may be also glorified together
[58:14] so you mean
[58:16] being sons and daughters and heirs and
[58:19] join heirs
[58:20] is attached has an attachment called
[58:24] suffering according to what Paul said
[58:27] for I reckon that the sufferings of this
[58:30] present time
[58:33] are not worthy to be compared
[58:36] with the glory
[58:38] which shall be revealed
[58:40] in US
[58:43] for the earnest expectation of the
[58:46] creature
[58:47] waiters for the manifestation
[58:51] of the sons of God
[58:54] may the Lord bless his words you may be
[58:56] seated
[59:02] I don't think there's any man that's
[59:04] ever really loved his wife
[59:08] that would not share
[59:10] everything that he had
[59:13] 50 years ago when Carol and I got
[59:15] married I was working at the anchor
[59:17] motel in Monticello Kentucky
[59:21] it was on Sunday
[59:23] they made me work on Sunday morning
[59:25] so Carol was anxiously awaiting
[59:29] for me to get off work
[59:32] I didn't have much to give her
[59:36] I had no home
[59:38] she had a rambler an American Rambler
[59:41] anybody know what them are antiques now
[59:43] wish we had that car
[59:45] she had an American Rambler
[59:48] and I had a 53 Ford truck
[59:53] we didn't have a house to live in
[59:56] I had no money
[59:59] and nothing to give her no insurance
[1:00:03] and I do not
[1:00:05] preach this is the way you're supposed
[1:00:07] to marry a woman
[1:00:10] I was in ignorance but I was greatly in
[1:00:14] love
[1:00:18] but what I had
[1:00:20] was hers you're laughing right you think
[1:00:23] what you just told us you didn't have
[1:00:24] anything well no I didn't
[1:00:27] but I I had my heart
[1:00:30] and my loyalty
[1:00:32] and my love
[1:00:34] and my integrity
[1:00:36] she's had that
[1:00:39] all these years
[1:00:42] I know it don't seem not much to you
[1:00:44] but it was all that I had
[1:00:47] and it's who I was
[1:00:50] so for some whenever they get married
[1:00:55] the marry a rich man's son
[1:00:58] it's Dad's a corporate guy
[1:01:02] flies on private jets
[1:01:06] rubs shoulders with the up and up
[1:01:09] people knowing by name
[1:01:11] been to the White House a few times
[1:01:14] or maybe he's a local businessman you're
[1:01:17] in Johnson City
[1:01:19] the people on the boards know him and
[1:01:22] people seem and shake his hand and speak
[1:01:24] to him and he has a reputation
[1:01:29] and his wife is not
[1:01:31] ashamed to say well who's your husband
[1:01:34] who you married to well I'm married to
[1:01:36] so-and-so oh yeah I've heard of him led
[1:01:39] a big guy with the Johnson City song
[1:01:42] yeah yeah that's my husband
[1:01:45] but what if we
[1:01:47] could be married
[1:01:50] to the king
[1:01:52] of the universe
[1:01:57] who owns
[1:01:59] everything
[1:02:01] not only owns it
[1:02:03] but made it
[1:02:06] then he would want to share
[1:02:10] what he is and what he has
[1:02:13] with us
[1:02:15] would he not I mean your brothers felt
[1:02:17] that way mother wife you married
[1:02:19] whatever you had not only from that
[1:02:22] point but from that point on whatever
[1:02:24] you would have
[1:02:26] you would give to her
[1:02:29] there's a lady at TJ Maxx showing
[1:02:31] Johnson City and she's worked there for
[1:02:33] years and years and for years Carol and
[1:02:35] I have been there and this lady has
[1:02:37] watched the purchases that we have made
[1:02:42] of course I'm surrounded by women
[1:02:45] married a wife thank God
[1:02:50] two daughters
[1:02:51] six
[1:02:53] granddaughters three sets of twins
[1:02:56] so a big portion of the purchases that
[1:02:59] we have made there
[1:03:01] have been women's dresses girls dresses
[1:03:04] women's shoes girls shoes women's girls
[1:03:09] women's girls
[1:03:11] so one day this lady asked me she said
[1:03:14] don't you ever get anything
[1:03:20] so I said yes ma'am every now and then I
[1:03:22] do I said but me and my wife we made
[1:03:25] this agreement whenever we got married
[1:03:27] how many ever years ago whenever I told
[1:03:29] this to her probably 10 or 12 years ago
[1:03:31] I said we made this agreement that every
[1:03:35] saying would be 50 50.
[1:03:38] so she's just standing there waiting for
[1:03:41] the rest of the story
[1:03:42] and I told her our agreement was it
[1:03:46] would be fifty dollars for her
[1:03:48] 50 cents for me
[1:03:53] I can see some of your sisters like that
[1:03:55] agreement sorry Brothers sorry brother
[1:03:58] Timothy
[1:04:01] and you know when I look at it
[1:04:06] was the Lord
[1:04:10] I don't feel like it's fifty dollars
[1:04:13] and 50 cents
[1:04:16] I feel like it would be more like 500
[1:04:19] trillion dollars
[1:04:21] that I get
[1:04:23] and he gets a nickel
[1:04:26] from me
[1:04:30] now maybe some of you have a higher
[1:04:31] esteem of yourself than I do
[1:04:34] but the closer I get to him the more I
[1:04:36] realize
[1:04:38] how little I've done for it
[1:04:41] I used to your brother brandemus he
[1:04:43] would say that
[1:04:45] he had set back up on the headboard and
[1:04:48] put his hands behind his head something
[1:04:50] like this I would imagine
[1:04:53] and he was began to think about that
[1:04:55] song Lord let me look past the curtain
[1:04:58] of time
[1:05:00] and as he did a voice said
[1:05:03] would you like to look past the curtain
[1:05:05] of time
[1:05:07] and he said yes it would help me so much
[1:05:14] and as he lay there he thought boy
[1:05:18] your past 50 years old
[1:05:21] you haven't done anything for God
[1:05:26] now listen past 50.
[1:05:29] by that time Millions
[1:05:32] had already been touched by his ministry
[1:05:35] thousands had been saved thousands had
[1:05:39] received the Holy Ghost
[1:05:41] thousands times thousands have been led
[1:05:44] to the Lord
[1:05:46] and as I first come to the message in
[1:05:48] Nigerians say that you remember about
[1:05:50] the time frame it was in early 1960 when
[1:05:53] he had this visitation I thought well
[1:05:56] you know maybe it was just him saying
[1:05:59] that in a humble way
[1:06:02] but as I learned more about him and
[1:06:04] about his ministry I realized no that
[1:06:07] wasn't him saying it in a humble way
[1:06:09] that's the way he thought about himself
[1:06:12] and I've realized great people
[1:06:16] the closer they get to God
[1:06:19] it's not the bigger they think they are
[1:06:22] it's the smaller they realize they are
[1:06:26] you see those who think they are so
[1:06:28] great and just go on and on and on about
[1:06:32] themselves whether or not you understand
[1:06:34] it it shows us the true picture
[1:06:37] that person isn't very close to God at
[1:06:40] all
[1:06:41] because if we ever get very close to him
[1:06:44] we'll realize how great and wonderful
[1:06:47] that he really really is
[1:06:50] how insignificant and how small and what
[1:06:54] little we all have done and yet when we
[1:06:56] stand there that day
[1:06:59] brother George Burcham which used to
[1:07:01] come to the church I Pastor in Kentucky
[1:07:03] he lived there in a little place called
[1:07:05] Albany Kentucky
[1:07:08] brother Branham came to his house
[1:07:11] 1965. brother George had a cheese plant
[1:07:14] where they made the cheese and the curd
[1:07:16] stage and the raw stage and real fine
[1:07:19] crumbly looking stuff brother random
[1:07:22] came there and brother George and his
[1:07:24] wife liked Antiques and he came to
[1:07:27] brother George's house brother George
[1:07:29] said he wouldn't even sit in the
[1:07:31] furniture
[1:07:32] he sat on the floor and set cross-legged
[1:07:36] like an Indian
[1:07:37] and he would cross his legs and sit
[1:07:40] there they tried begged him to sit on
[1:07:43] the furnace no no no no is that such
[1:07:45] pretty pretty stuff I I wouldn't want to
[1:07:48] sit on that so he sits in the floor
[1:07:53] brother George said he was a type of a
[1:07:56] man
[1:07:57] that would talk about you and make you
[1:08:00] think you were so great and you were
[1:08:03] just sold this and that
[1:08:07] I wonder sometimes if we understand what
[1:08:10] greatness really is
[1:08:13] and yet this great one the Lord Jesus
[1:08:17] that we're talking about
[1:08:19] wants to share
[1:08:21] everything he has
[1:08:24] with us
[1:08:26] and he doesn't want to wait till the
[1:08:28] other side
[1:08:30] for everything to be shared
[1:08:33] but alas there are some things that
[1:08:35] cannot be shared until we get to the
[1:08:38] other side
[1:08:41] much of what we get
[1:08:44] is absolutely
[1:08:46] given to us as a free gift
[1:08:51] with no work
[1:08:53] no praying no fasting no labor on our
[1:08:59] part
[1:09:01] but there are some things that he wants
[1:09:04] to give us
[1:09:06] that requirements are made
[1:09:11] and one of these rights that he wishes
[1:09:14] to share
[1:09:15] with his bride
[1:09:17] is the right to reign
[1:09:20] to be
[1:09:22] on a throne with him
[1:09:28] to him that overcome us
[1:09:31] will be granted the right the privilege
[1:09:33] the honor
[1:09:35] to set with him and his throne
[1:09:38] as he has overcome and sat down with his
[1:09:41] father
[1:09:42] in his throne
[1:09:45] can you and I imagine this morning that
[1:09:48] when the Rapture takes place
[1:09:51] this word will so make us ready
[1:09:57] we will go straight from Johnson City
[1:10:00] Kingsport Bristol wherever it is you
[1:10:03] live
[1:10:04] straight from this world
[1:10:06] into the presence of God
[1:10:11] and will we will be so prepared by the
[1:10:14] word
[1:10:15] and the ministry that God's given
[1:10:18] you will need no supplements you will
[1:10:22] need nothing along the way between here
[1:10:24] and Heaven to make you a better person
[1:10:27] to finish up what you've liked this word
[1:10:31] will produce such a character of people
[1:10:36] in one moment you are a mortal
[1:10:40] facing all kinds of battles
[1:10:43] all kinds of Trials
[1:10:46] and then the next moment you will be
[1:10:48] standing there
[1:10:50] in a body that is made like unto his own
[1:10:54] glorious body
[1:10:57] you will then be changed and brought
[1:11:00] into the court of his majesty
[1:11:05] I'm not talking about now
[1:11:07] a place where a judge is or maybe a
[1:11:11] mayor and a few years ago or brother
[1:11:13] Mike Walsh took us to the White House
[1:11:16] and we was able to go to the White House
[1:11:19] and see some of the different famous
[1:11:21] people and while I was standing there
[1:11:24] the vice president at the time Mike
[1:11:25] Pence came out and was shaking hands
[1:11:29] with the people and I got to shake his
[1:11:32] hand
[1:11:33] the Bodyguards of course all around him
[1:11:36] and they rushed him through and I have
[1:11:39] to say that was quite an honor seeing
[1:11:42] people that are the rich and the famous
[1:11:46] but who are they compared to Jesus
[1:11:51] you and I were never more than likely be
[1:11:54] allowed allowed to
[1:11:56] to the White House
[1:11:58] would never be a personal guest of the
[1:12:01] president
[1:12:02] or of some great person
[1:12:08] and yet the greatest one that ever lived
[1:12:12] invites you daily
[1:12:14] into his courts
[1:12:18] and what's so sad is there's days that
[1:12:21] go by
[1:12:22] and we don't even go
[1:12:25] we don't even use that opportunity that
[1:12:29] is given to each of us
[1:12:31] to come into the presence of almighty
[1:12:34] God
[1:12:36] and I find that so amazing that he
[1:12:40] understands the Frailty
[1:12:43] and the weakness of our Humanity
[1:12:46] and he loves us
[1:12:48] in spite of ourself aren't you glad he
[1:12:51] does
[1:12:54] the Paul when he Taps into this in verse
[1:12:57] 17 he said if children than air is Heirs
[1:13:00] of God in John heires with Christ if so
[1:13:03] be that we suffer with him that we may
[1:13:06] be also glorified together I want you to
[1:13:09] notice how Paul
[1:13:11] so they'll use the word prudently
[1:13:15] as he sets Force this High exalted
[1:13:20] position
[1:13:22] he elevates them to this top part of
[1:13:27] this verse
[1:13:28] notice what he does before he introduces
[1:13:32] the word suffer
[1:13:35] he elevates them to a position
[1:13:39] that only God could do
[1:13:42] so he says that if children
[1:13:45] than heirs Heirs of God join heirs was
[1:13:49] Christ and he goes from that to the very
[1:13:52] next part of this verse if so be
[1:13:56] that we suffer
[1:13:59] he didn't mention the suffer part first
[1:14:02] but he mentioned the great elevation
[1:14:05] that God had given by grace
[1:14:09] then he brings in the painful part
[1:14:13] the higher Joy the higher glorification
[1:14:17] first then
[1:14:19] the pain
[1:14:21] then the suffering the pleasure the
[1:14:25] happiness the extreme joy
[1:14:28] and then
[1:14:30] the pain
[1:14:31] the suffering how many suffered as a
[1:14:35] Christian if you've been saved very long
[1:14:36] I guarantee you you have
[1:14:39] what's amazing is that all of those of
[1:14:43] us who suffer as being a Christian
[1:14:47] that is attributed for the sake of the
[1:14:52] Gospel now whether you're a young sister
[1:14:55] that is laughed at because of your hair
[1:14:57] your dress because you don't have makeup
[1:15:00] whether you're a young boy that's like
[1:15:03] that because you don't talk and drink
[1:15:06] and cuss and act like the other young
[1:15:08] boys at school or at college where you
[1:15:10] go whatever it is that you go through
[1:15:13] the Lord Jesus actually attributes that
[1:15:17] to your account
[1:15:19] as if so it was himself being persecuted
[1:15:24] again
[1:15:26] so everything that you go through Peter
[1:15:30] says it this way in First Peter chapter
[1:15:32] 4 verse 16 yet if any man suffer as a
[1:15:37] Christian
[1:15:38] now all of us suffer things that are
[1:15:41] self-inflicted we can do some pretty
[1:15:44] dumb stuff can't we
[1:15:46] well come on be honest we have all done
[1:15:49] pretty dumb stuff we've acted dumb we've
[1:15:52] taught them we've just acted you know
[1:15:55] pretty ignorant sometimes and then we've
[1:15:58] suffered because of that but you're not
[1:16:01] suffering because you're a Christian
[1:16:03] when you do something stupid
[1:16:06] that's your own stupidity and mine right
[1:16:09] but now Peter wants to characterize and
[1:16:13] show them the differentiation between
[1:16:15] them doing something and messing up and
[1:16:19] then suffering a persecution because of
[1:16:22] it or if any man will suffer as a
[1:16:26] Christian now notice what we're supposed
[1:16:28] to do if any man suffer as a Christian
[1:16:31] let him not be ashamed but let him
[1:16:35] glorify God on this behalf now I'm not
[1:16:40] sure about you but I'm still working on
[1:16:42] the last part of that verse because
[1:16:44] there's a reproach there's a pain
[1:16:47] there's can be great sorrow and
[1:16:50] difficulty in suffering for the cause of
[1:16:53] Christ now some would take this as if
[1:16:56] though that it's only say Martyrs or
[1:17:00] only those that are persecuted because
[1:17:03] they're a preacher but not so you see
[1:17:06] God will commit some to death God will
[1:17:11] commit some to suffering in their body
[1:17:14] he himself has the power to heal them
[1:17:18] what are you about to say a word all you
[1:17:20] have to do is just look the direction
[1:17:21] that thing would be gone
[1:17:23] but he actually incorporates their life
[1:17:27] into bringing glory to God by bearing
[1:17:32] something sometimes for many years
[1:17:36] and yet it is attributed to bringing
[1:17:40] glory and honor to the kingdom of God
[1:17:44] term limited John chapter 9. a very
[1:17:48] familiar story that all you Bible
[1:17:49] readers know and I'm sure you'll love it
[1:17:51] John chapter 9 it is about the blind man
[1:17:55] and as Jesus passed by saw a man which
[1:17:59] was blind from his verse now let's get
[1:18:04] the setting we don't know exactly how
[1:18:06] old the man was but it's not considered
[1:18:09] a boy or a use he's actually identified
[1:18:13] as a man and if you read whenever you
[1:18:17] want to on down of course to verse 7 8 9
[1:18:19] 10 on down you'll find I think it's in
[1:18:21] verse 8 that the Bible says that he set
[1:18:24] there as a beggar now I want you to say
[1:18:27] the background of this is he was born
[1:18:30] blind he had never seen in his entire
[1:18:33] life so he was blind from his verse and
[1:18:37] his disciples asked him saying master
[1:18:40] who did Sin this man or his parents that
[1:18:43] he was born blind Jesus answered neither
[1:18:46] had this man sin nor his parents but
[1:18:49] that the works of God should be made
[1:18:53] manifest in him
[1:18:57] so you mean this man
[1:18:59] sat there for years
[1:19:03] for years
[1:19:05] waiting for the works of God to be made
[1:19:07] manifest in his life
[1:19:11] I wonder how much he was ridiculed
[1:19:15] how he was laughed at
[1:19:18] now this man as far as we know ever
[1:19:21] become a preacher
[1:19:22] but yet the Lord God was able to do
[1:19:26] something through his life that he never
[1:19:30] done through Peter
[1:19:31] and that was that the works of God you
[1:19:35] see God needed someone
[1:19:38] in this kind of condition
[1:19:41] what couldn't the Lord have allowed some
[1:19:45] accident to happen just say a week prior
[1:19:49] to this
[1:19:50] and the man will say fell out of a tree
[1:19:53] and got a concussion and he lost his
[1:19:57] sight and he couldn't see well he went
[1:19:59] to one doctor another said you know what
[1:20:01] it looks like that you're just blind for
[1:20:03] the rest of your life and it only
[1:20:04] happened a week ago
[1:20:06] well then Jesus would have come to town
[1:20:08] a week later and the man would have come
[1:20:11] up and the prayer line is would say and
[1:20:14] the Lord Jesus would have healed the man
[1:20:16] and his suffering would have been very
[1:20:19] short-lived
[1:20:20] huh
[1:20:23] but every local person
[1:20:26] knew this man
[1:20:30] so the links of time was a further
[1:20:34] Vindication of the glory and the power
[1:20:38] of God
[1:20:40] now had he fallen out of a tree or some
[1:20:43] type of freak's accident that the people
[1:20:45] said well his sight just come back well
[1:20:47] the doctor would have said well why sure
[1:20:49] yeah we've seen that before that's what
[1:20:51] it was but God wanted it to be proven
[1:20:55] beyond a shadow of a doubt that he was
[1:20:59] the Healer
[1:21:01] but have you ever thought about the pain
[1:21:04] this man must have bore
[1:21:07] to give God these years
[1:21:10] of his life
[1:21:13] how many Summers was he robbed
[1:21:17] how many beautiful flowers he never got
[1:21:21] to see
[1:21:23] maybe he would ask people
[1:21:25] what does the sun look like
[1:21:28] I feel it
[1:21:30] I feel that I come here early in the
[1:21:32] morning and I shiver in the cold and
[1:21:35] it's chilly but I can feel something as
[1:21:38] it touches my skin and warms my hand and
[1:21:42] I feel it as it moves up to my arm and
[1:21:44] then touches my face well that's the sun
[1:21:47] well what does it look like exactly well
[1:21:50] it's a great bright ball in this in the
[1:21:54] sky and it's great Illuminating Light
[1:21:57] and and then well tell me tell me
[1:21:59] something else what's that I hear oh
[1:22:01] that that's a bird
[1:22:03] a bird what kind of collar I don't know
[1:22:06] it's just a bird you know people like us
[1:22:09] that see it every day and we don't even
[1:22:10] pay no attention to it we don't even
[1:22:12] thank God for the breath of air that we
[1:22:14] breathe and we don't thank him because
[1:22:16] we can walk come on we don't think him
[1:22:19] cause we got two hands and two arms that
[1:22:21] we can raise and praise him and you know
[1:22:23] how we are we just take it for granted
[1:22:25] but wait what tell me what's the bird
[1:22:27] look like what color I don't know I've
[1:22:29] heard it all in my life I don't know
[1:22:30] what it is it's just a bird well
[1:22:32] somebody please tell me what what's the
[1:22:34] what's the plumage on the bird well what
[1:22:37] about this what about that he had been
[1:22:39] robbed for years for this reason
[1:22:44] the glory
[1:22:45] of God needed to be made manifest
[1:22:50] brother Paul I wonder how many times he
[1:22:53] was laughed at
[1:22:55] you know how cruel people can be
[1:22:58] I wonder how many times he was made fun
[1:23:01] of
[1:23:03] he had no way of making a living he was
[1:23:06] a beggar can you imagine begging every
[1:23:09] day of your life
[1:23:15] and yet Jesus says
[1:23:18] but the works of God should be made
[1:23:20] manifest in him
[1:23:24] so Jesus was going to prove that he was
[1:23:30] God
[1:23:33] by opening a Blind Man's eyes that had
[1:23:35] been blind from his birth
[1:23:40] so he was robbed
[1:23:43] that God
[1:23:44] might have Glory
[1:23:48] I wonder how many of us are willing to
[1:23:51] be robbed of this or that
[1:23:54] or the other now don't get caught on me
[1:23:57] already now if God needed someone
[1:24:01] in this day
[1:24:04] that could be healed of some terrible
[1:24:07] terrible disease or sickness
[1:24:11] but he must prove it by this specialist
[1:24:14] and that one and another and a scan and
[1:24:19] an MRI and a CT and this one and that
[1:24:24] one and a doctor here and the doctor
[1:24:26] there and a doctor over there and
[1:24:28] another doctor over there
[1:24:30] and then when God does it records from
[1:24:33] from one state to another
[1:24:36] how many of us would be willing to say
[1:24:37] Lord
[1:24:38] I will
[1:24:42] four of us five six seven eight nine ten
[1:24:45] eleven twelve takes us a while to think
[1:24:47] about it on to process it and say now
[1:24:49] Lord I don't want to commit to this if I
[1:24:51] can't do it
[1:24:53] you see how the glory of God Is So
[1:24:56] intertwined with our life
[1:24:59] and yet sometimes the glory of God cost
[1:25:03] the recipient of those works
[1:25:07] such a price
[1:25:15] I find this amazing because the
[1:25:18] disciples the preachers
[1:25:22] they didn't look at this man as an
[1:25:24] object of Mercy
[1:25:28] but rather a subject
[1:25:31] of a discussion about theology
[1:25:36] so they never even looked at the guy and
[1:25:38] said poor guy is there anything we can
[1:25:41] do for it Jesus have mercy on him oh God
[1:25:44] please be mindful they don't even look
[1:25:47] at him but that way at all
[1:25:49] but they look at his situation and they
[1:25:53] go to discussing the theology
[1:25:56] of how did this man get this way
[1:25:59] may God help us to never be so cold
[1:26:02] and so indifferent
[1:26:04] oh don't you want to be touched don't
[1:26:07] you want to be touched by people's
[1:26:09] failures and their weaknesses and their
[1:26:12] frailties and their infirmities
[1:26:16] so the disciples look at him and you
[1:26:19] know imagine how it must have broken the
[1:26:22] very heart of the Lord Jesus so what we
[1:26:25] see in this that Jesus is showing a
[1:26:28] greater view of suffering which had not
[1:26:32] up to this time been viewed correctly
[1:26:35] we remember job of course and different
[1:26:38] ones in the Bible in the Old Testament
[1:26:40] and they went through a suffering but
[1:26:42] yet it was still not brought us clear as
[1:26:46] it would be in the New Testament so
[1:26:48] Jesus brings out a view in the New
[1:26:52] Testament and then Paul picks it up
[1:26:53] Peter picks it up Paul writes about it
[1:26:56] in Hebrews chapter 12 if you'd like to
[1:26:58] read that with me verse 6 and he says
[1:27:01] for whom the Lord love us
[1:27:04] he chastened us
[1:27:08] which means to train children to be
[1:27:11] instructed talk or learn
[1:27:14] to chase sin by Affliction of evils
[1:27:21] and calamities
[1:27:25] while
[1:27:28] anybody in line behind me
[1:27:30] for this
[1:27:33] oh wait a minute maybe I should be
[1:27:34] behind you
[1:27:37] listen now what the
[1:27:43] what the chastise with blows
[1:27:48] to scourge
[1:27:50] of a father punishing his son
[1:27:54] for whom the Lord loveth
[1:27:58] he chasteneth
[1:28:01] not only life about it sometimes about
[1:28:03] going to church well what do you
[1:28:05] expecting to church today a woman
[1:28:08] I'm going to church to get beat up I'm
[1:28:10] going to get the hot tore off of me and
[1:28:12] I know we life about it but I'll tell
[1:28:15] you one thing you ought to be one of the
[1:28:17] happiest human beings on the earth if
[1:28:19] God corrects you
[1:28:21] that means your sons and daughters
[1:28:25] that means he loves you
[1:28:29] you ought to be so grateful he won't let
[1:28:32] you do wrong I never even make you feel
[1:28:35] bad about it there are people that claim
[1:28:38] to be Christians there are men that
[1:28:41] claim to be preachers and they can cause
[1:28:45] one of the biggest messes ever was in
[1:28:49] the ranks of a message or in a local
[1:28:51] church or whatever and never feel one
[1:28:55] bad feeling from God at all
[1:28:59] they will tear up this and that and the
[1:29:02] other and spew out their false Doctrine
[1:29:05] or whatever it is and will cause all
[1:29:08] kinds of situations and never feel
[1:29:11] terrible at all
[1:29:13] oh my goodness
[1:29:16] I'm so glad that my Holy Ghost if I
[1:29:21] think the wrong thing if I don't even
[1:29:23] have to say the wrong thing if I say the
[1:29:27] wrong thing if I get the wrong attitude
[1:29:30] praise the Lord Brother JD told you
[1:29:32] about an attitude I had one time hey I'm
[1:29:35] so glad that when I do that my father
[1:29:38] won't let me go on and say well it's
[1:29:40] okay it's fine it don't matter it does
[1:29:43] matter to our God and that not only
[1:29:46] matters to God but it matters to his
[1:29:49] children
[1:29:52] notice to whom the Lord loved us he said
[1:29:55] he's chasing us and Scourge us every son
[1:29:59] that he receive us so every son that
[1:30:03] comes to God will be chastened and he
[1:30:06] will be discouraged and chastised notice
[1:30:10] in verse 7 if ye endure chastening now
[1:30:15] notice the further stage of chastening
[1:30:18] so God could spank you or correct you
[1:30:21] and then you get an attitude and you
[1:30:24] still don't go on to placing but verse 7
[1:30:27] brings the volume of it together if ye
[1:30:30] endure which means take patiently to
[1:30:34] remain not to recede or flee to preserve
[1:30:39] under misfortunes and trials to hold
[1:30:43] fast to one's face in Christ
[1:30:46] they are bravely and calmly ill
[1:30:51] treatments bear bravely I mean needs
[1:30:54] help this morning by bravely and calmly
[1:30:58] ill treatments
[1:31:01] if he endure chastening God deals with
[1:31:05] you deals with you house with sons for
[1:31:08] what sign is he whom the father chasten
[1:31:12] us not
[1:31:14] now the disciples are going to get of
[1:31:17] you into the history and the sadness of
[1:31:22] this man's life
[1:31:23] and yet the glory of God is going to be
[1:31:26] expressed in him in a way that was not
[1:31:29] expressing any other character in the
[1:31:31] entirety of the New Testament we don't
[1:31:33] have time to get into it this morning
[1:31:34] but I'd like to take this man right here
[1:31:37] and show you the mystery of redemption
[1:31:39] lays right in the very life of this man
[1:31:42] even the very word that Jesus chose to
[1:31:46] use to send him to a certain pool
[1:31:48] signified the mission of the Lord Jesus
[1:31:51] to the Earth
[1:31:52] but watch this man the disciples
[1:31:55] wandering now and the Lord Jesus totally
[1:31:57] blows our theology out of the water and
[1:32:00] he said neither one of them but this man
[1:32:01] was born blind that the works of God
[1:32:03] might be made manifest in his life so
[1:32:06] the disciples are going to see it now
[1:32:09] the man himself is going to receive two
[1:32:13] aspects of Illumination he's going to
[1:32:16] receive sight in his eyes but he's also
[1:32:19] going to receive sight in his soul
[1:32:22] praise God for this man was the very one
[1:32:25] that stood up before the scribes and the
[1:32:28] Pharisees and said for they know that
[1:32:30] God here is not Sinners but if any man
[1:32:33] be a worshiper of him and do us his will
[1:32:36] him he hear us whether this man be a
[1:32:39] sinner or no I don't know but this one
[1:32:42] thing I do know where I was blind now I
[1:32:45] see
[1:32:47] the prophet said this guy had some
[1:32:49] pretty good theology on himself now so
[1:32:52] this man is fixing to experience the
[1:32:55] glory of God but look at the price
[1:32:58] look at those years he would never
[1:33:01] regain them brother Rob all the years as
[1:33:04] a young man we don't know if he was
[1:33:06] married or not scripture says nothing
[1:33:07] about a wife or nothing about children
[1:33:09] the only thing it mentions as far as
[1:33:12] family is his father and mother now you
[1:33:14] said why didn't his mom and daddy let me
[1:33:16] stay at home why in the world when they
[1:33:18] come right down to it whenever they said
[1:33:20] they'd asked to ask the mother and
[1:33:21] father said what about this guy I'll
[1:33:23] tell you what he's old enough ask him
[1:33:25] they wouldn't even stand with their son
[1:33:28] after he had been miraculously healed by
[1:33:31] the power of God and yet the Lord Jesus
[1:33:34] said this man was saved for this purpose
[1:33:37] this man was reserved for this purpose
[1:33:41] as a matter of fact I knew it would
[1:33:44] happen and I allowed this to be on him
[1:33:48] and there was a time I was going to take
[1:33:51] it off
[1:33:52] I hope you understand what I'm going to
[1:33:54] say I want my life to bring glory to God
[1:33:57] anybody else
[1:33:59] sometimes that might be by me laying my
[1:34:03] hands on the set and them recovering
[1:34:06] other times it might be by me preaching
[1:34:09] and someone gets saved someone get
[1:34:11] filled with the Holy Ghost and it might
[1:34:13] be other times that God would allow me
[1:34:15] to go through a trial and a test of my
[1:34:18] faith and I stand there and I will not
[1:34:21] be shaken I will not be moved and I wait
[1:34:24] for the day of my Deliverance there
[1:34:28] might be times that God will let you and
[1:34:30] I go through something like this man
[1:34:32] that will be prolonged I pray carefully
[1:34:35] myself about such things as this and I
[1:34:38] say God unless you have a reason for
[1:34:42] this going on longer would you move for
[1:34:45] me speedily now this is the way we've
[1:34:48] been praying for Erica for a long time
[1:34:50] lord unless you have a reason for this
[1:34:54] going on if there's a reason somehow
[1:34:57] that you want another doctor to see her
[1:35:00] another nurse to see her that will have
[1:35:03] to testify of the glory of God then we
[1:35:07] want that to happen but if not Lord make
[1:35:10] a hasty Miracle out of her life look at
[1:35:13] by the wrong Spencer he told me some
[1:35:15] time ago one of his doctors told him at
[1:35:17] the University of Virginia in
[1:35:19] Charlottesville that whenever he is
[1:35:21] healed it will be one of the most proven
[1:35:24] authenticated Miracles that have been in
[1:35:27] history why because one scan after
[1:35:30] another one doctor I try another one
[1:35:33] test after another if God would have
[1:35:36] healed thy brother the very moment that
[1:35:39] he found out about it there would not be
[1:35:41] near as much proof and all sometimes I
[1:35:45] wonder about his pain
[1:35:48] his heaviness
[1:35:50] when I know a person not long ago he
[1:35:53] vomited eight times before going to
[1:35:55] church to preach on Sunday morning
[1:35:58] you think he wouldn't rather be healed
[1:36:01] you'd think he wouldn't rather have it
[1:36:03] behind him
[1:36:04] you think he wouldn't rather be able to
[1:36:06] stand and not have to have to deal with
[1:36:09] all that he deals of taking all these
[1:36:11] pills every day of his life and the
[1:36:14] doctor sent him a few ever stop it you
[1:36:16] will not live no time it will overcome
[1:36:19] you and you will die
[1:36:23] but what if God
[1:36:25] has a reason to bring Glory but he has
[1:36:30] to find an individual that is willing to
[1:36:34] suffer
[1:36:35] that God can use them
[1:36:38] For That Glory
[1:36:43] I changed my mind I don't want to be
[1:36:45] first in life
[1:36:47] let's start back there
[1:36:49] and we'll make the end of the line right
[1:36:51] up here
[1:36:52] on the platform we'll start back there
[1:36:55] anybody willing I didn't think so
[1:36:59] but Eddie what is it about us
[1:37:03] all we want the God is God don't we
[1:37:06] want God to use you for something
[1:37:09] but we want this I wouldn't
[1:37:14] you see it takes a very special person
[1:37:19] to be able to be tried
[1:37:21] in this life
[1:37:24] when you see others
[1:37:26] being delivered
[1:37:28] others being healed and changed by the
[1:37:33] power of God
[1:37:34] and God touches you in intervals and
[1:37:39] moves for you something is unmindful
[1:37:42] but a psyche touches you with this touch
[1:37:44] and attached to the touch
[1:37:47] is the words wait
[1:37:50] for further explanation
[1:37:53] so he brings strength how many has ever
[1:37:55] been there whenever you just felt like
[1:37:57] you were at the end of your rope and you
[1:37:59] didn't know what to do and you felt like
[1:38:01] you couldn't make it another day and the
[1:38:03] spirit of God would touch you and help
[1:38:06] you and yet not totally deliver you
[1:38:09] and then somebody else the next service
[1:38:11] turned into a a praise testimony or I
[1:38:14] want to thank God I'll tell you what I
[1:38:16] come to the prayer line and I needed
[1:38:18] this this and this and God heal me God
[1:38:20] delivered me and you're thinking God I
[1:38:22] was right behind them I was right behind
[1:38:25] them in the line I needed it too Lord I
[1:38:29] needed it why didn't you hear me
[1:38:34] but can God trust you
[1:38:37] for two more months
[1:38:39] can God trust you for another month
[1:38:43] what about his sisters can God trust you
[1:38:45] for another few more weeks can God delay
[1:38:51] let's set this way he would get this
[1:38:53] much Glory if he healed you immediately
[1:38:56] but if he waits
[1:38:58] and he strengthens and he encourages and
[1:39:00] he uplifts and he helps you and he helps
[1:39:03] you and he goes a month two months six
[1:39:05] months a year and then he goes way Way
[1:39:09] Beyond all of that
[1:39:10] and he gets going to further
[1:39:13] back he gets all that Glory
[1:39:17] but he'll walk close to you
[1:39:27] you may not be able to go on picnics
[1:39:29] with your children
[1:39:34] you may be even knocked out of service
[1:39:36] sometimes
[1:39:39] you may not be able to go shopping
[1:39:43] the meditation don't feel like even
[1:39:44] getting out of bed
[1:39:46] oh
[1:39:54] can God
[1:39:56] find some
[1:40:01] that we'll be willing for such
[1:40:05] he will
[1:40:08] and don't worry
[1:40:10] he's not looking necessarily for
[1:40:12] volunteers
[1:40:15] he's looking for the chosen
[1:40:19] every man under your Testament
[1:40:22] cannot be this
[1:40:26] a preacher in the message
[1:40:28] could not go through what brother Ron's
[1:40:30] pictures went through
[1:40:33] I think this morning and I sit and
[1:40:35] thinking about him
[1:40:37] of my dear little precious friend
[1:40:41] brother template
[1:40:45] God in his wisdom
[1:40:49] chose to take
[1:40:51] my little brothers
[1:40:53] wife
[1:40:58] that's with him standing back down the
[1:41:00] other day
[1:41:04] when my arms around him
[1:41:07] both of us crying
[1:41:10] because of sister Karen's passing
[1:41:15] and I have to be honest
[1:41:17] I hope and pray to God
[1:41:28] does he like it
[1:41:31] I said brother tell me how you doing
[1:41:33] buddy
[1:41:35] he said brother Donnie I've just I'm
[1:41:38] going on
[1:41:39] I'm going to serve the Lord I'm going to
[1:41:42] commit to him
[1:41:45] but he said it's so hard
[1:41:50] he said men care and we're close
[1:41:53] thank you and Carol
[1:41:58] I was down to use Camp I saw Miss sinner
[1:42:01] going to their house so miss said I
[1:42:03] thought my goodness
[1:42:05] I miss seeing her
[1:42:07] just getting to see her a few times a
[1:42:08] year
[1:42:10] I cannot imagine what they're doing
[1:42:11] myself
[1:42:15] if Mother Tim would have had a choice
[1:42:17] and a preference
[1:42:19] and the Lord had said what do you think
[1:42:20] I'm thinking about taking Karen
[1:42:23] what do you think I know anyone left to
[1:42:25] know everybody said no Lord don't
[1:42:28] please don't take her
[1:42:31] how will I live Lord
[1:42:40] but somehow
[1:42:43] I don't know how
[1:42:46] somehow God
[1:42:49] will get Glory
[1:42:54] do I understand why the Lord
[1:43:00] wanted to take one of my right hand men
[1:43:04] brother Jim bath
[1:43:08] my brother Jim was sick I never ever
[1:43:11] thought
[1:43:13] he would pass
[1:43:14] never
[1:43:17] I thought no we need him too much
[1:43:21] no Lord you no
[1:43:24] you can
[1:43:29] do I understand why
[1:43:32] brother Gene Lehman do I understand why
[1:43:35] I don't
[1:43:37] on and on I could go
[1:43:40] but I know this
[1:43:42] Our Father
[1:43:44] makes no mistakes
[1:43:50] but I guarantee in fulfilling the will
[1:43:53] of God their hearts setting you today
[1:43:56] that are still dealing and suffering
[1:43:59] what's the loss
[1:44:04] ask my son-in-law Scott if he still
[1:44:06] misses his daddy
[1:44:08] that's my daughter Alicia she misses she
[1:44:10] loves Jimmy like a father second father
[1:44:14] ask my granddaughters I said Courtney
[1:44:16] sister Lindsay don't need to ask her
[1:44:19] you know how she feels
[1:44:22] some of the rest of you that have lost
[1:44:23] loved ones and you think in a premature
[1:44:25] time
[1:44:27] why would God do such
[1:44:31] somehow
[1:44:33] he will make it work to his glory
[1:44:47] you go unservatively
[1:44:50] brokenhearted yeah
[1:44:56] one of your greatest treasures taken
[1:44:58] from you
[1:45:04] I hear the prophet as he says
[1:45:09] when God took my wife
[1:45:13] and my little girl
[1:45:15] and he said the thing that shook me
[1:45:18] and I couldn't understand it
[1:45:23] and he said that then some time later I
[1:45:25] saw her
[1:45:27] as a young woman
[1:45:30] on the curtain of time you remember the
[1:45:32] story he saw her as a young woman
[1:45:35] and I saw that wagon
[1:45:38] and the Broken Wheel
[1:45:41] and I looked at her and I realized
[1:45:45] thank you Lord
[1:45:48] if he would have let her lived
[1:45:53] she might have turned away from him
[1:45:57] so he had to take her
[1:46:01] you can hear him still in 1965.
[1:46:04] dealing with the loss of that first life
[1:46:07] and that little baby
[1:46:10] still dealing with the pain
[1:46:13] and Satan come to him no doubt year
[1:46:16] after year well you know what the devil
[1:46:18] told him standing at the casket he
[1:46:20] wouldn't even have to look your way he
[1:46:21] wouldn't have to say a word yeah you've
[1:46:23] served him and you've done this and that
[1:46:25] and the other and look at him now now he
[1:46:27] won't even answer your prayer
[1:46:30] the prophet said I was about to the
[1:46:32] place and I said well if that's the way
[1:46:35] he is
[1:46:39] but he said thank God there was a typos
[1:46:42] and I said the Lord give and the Lord
[1:46:46] taken away blessed be the name
[1:46:49] of the Lord
[1:46:53] because I can't say that I fully
[1:46:55] comprehend
[1:46:58] what's suffering in time
[1:47:01] and suffering as a mortal does
[1:47:05] how that it translates
[1:47:08] into qualities that are
[1:47:12] eternal
[1:47:13] but we know he himself suffered greatly
[1:47:18] that he might become part of us aren't
[1:47:22] you glad he did
[1:47:24] notice Paul says in First Corinthians 4
[1:47:26] 9 if I think that God has set forth us
[1:47:29] the apostles last
[1:47:32] were appointed to death
[1:47:35] we are made a spectacle unto the world
[1:47:38] the word spectacle here is a word
[1:47:40] associated with the Roman Arena
[1:47:43] so but this time they're already doing
[1:47:46] the Gladiators and so on in the in the
[1:47:48] arena
[1:47:49] and Paul was placing the apostles as
[1:47:53] they were out in the middle of the arena
[1:47:55] and The Spectators were on looking
[1:47:58] notice how broad he makes the audience
[1:48:00] we are the spectacle to the world
[1:48:04] to angels and to men
[1:48:07] so the angels are watching while the
[1:48:10] apostles are being laughed at ridiculed
[1:48:13] made fun of the world is looking on and
[1:48:18] other men are looking on and Paul is
[1:48:22] trying to understand God why would you
[1:48:25] make us as the apostles you set us forth
[1:48:28] last but yet the apostles were the ones
[1:48:31] who were called first
[1:48:34] notice how it goes on my in verse 10 for
[1:48:40] we are fools for Christ's sake but ye
[1:48:43] are wise in Christ
[1:48:45] notice the difference between the
[1:48:47] leadership and the body
[1:48:49] or how we reverse this around down
[1:48:51] Through the Ages I'm going to make Idols
[1:48:53] out of the preachers that show wasn't
[1:48:56] the way it was in the New Testament
[1:48:58] Almighty said we are fools for Christ's
[1:49:00] sake but ye are wise in Christ we are
[1:49:03] weak but ye are strong
[1:49:06] ye are honorable but we are despised
[1:49:12] even unto this present hour we boast
[1:49:16] hunger
[1:49:17] and thirst
[1:49:19] and are naked
[1:49:21] and buffeted
[1:49:24] Lord have mercy
[1:49:27] can you imagine the Apostle Paul
[1:49:30] being hungry
[1:49:33] Lord
[1:49:35] I'd love to be able to bought him some
[1:49:37] deep wouldn't you
[1:49:39] him being hungry
[1:49:41] being thirsty and didn't even have the
[1:49:44] proper clothes to wear and yet one of
[1:49:47] the greatest men of God that ever stood
[1:49:49] on the earth why why
[1:49:52] God is getting something out of his life
[1:49:56] which does not come as praise
[1:50:00] and honor and so on
[1:50:03] begotten
[1:50:05] by suffering
[1:50:08] and yet the apostles names
[1:50:11] are in the foundation of the city
[1:50:14] for eternity every time you go in and
[1:50:18] out the gates of pearl and you look back
[1:50:22] on those walls that will be the names of
[1:50:26] The Twelve Apostles
[1:50:28] in that great City they will have great
[1:50:30] honor but think of what a price it costs
[1:50:37] Lord God
[1:50:38] we are naked buffeted and have no
[1:50:42] certain Dwelling Place
[1:50:44] I labor working with our hands being
[1:50:47] reviled
[1:50:49] look at the word to reproach rail at
[1:50:52] revile Heap abuse upon
[1:50:57] we are reviled we bless
[1:51:00] being persecuted we suffer it
[1:51:05] being defamed
[1:51:07] we entreat look at the Opposites being
[1:51:11] defamed they make fun of us they laugh
[1:51:14] at us they call us all kinds of names
[1:51:15] and we entreat which means Comfort to
[1:51:20] call to one side to admonish exhort
[1:51:23] what's being molded in these men
[1:51:26] character worthy of foundation
[1:51:30] identification
[1:51:33] friends do you honestly think a lot of
[1:51:35] these radio preachers and television
[1:51:37] preachers in the modern days would be
[1:51:39] the worthy kind of men to have their
[1:51:41] names placed in the foundation of the
[1:51:43] city of God
[1:51:47] we being the bride we're different from
[1:51:51] the church we're different from people
[1:51:53] that are just saved
[1:51:56] there must be a character from us
[1:51:59] that must supersede
[1:52:02] and go beyond
[1:52:04] the church
[1:52:07] can I have a few more minutes
[1:52:09] being defamed we entreat
[1:52:13] we are made as the filth
[1:52:18] of the world off scouring refuse
[1:52:23] metaphorically the most abject and
[1:52:27] Despicable men
[1:52:31] isn't that strange you and I would count
[1:52:33] it as such an honor to hung around Paul
[1:52:37] but yet they were made the filth
[1:52:41] the filth
[1:52:43] of the world
[1:52:45] why
[1:52:46] getting ready for Glory
[1:52:49] you see we're on a journey to the throne
[1:52:53] remember Joseph's Journey remember
[1:52:56] David's Journey remember Esther's
[1:52:59] Journey to the throne
[1:53:02] character must be molded from the call
[1:53:06] and the summons
[1:53:08] to the crowning
[1:53:10] a character must be molded in us which
[1:53:13] will match
[1:53:15] our Lord
[1:53:19] heart God
[1:53:21] as the filth of the world
[1:53:24] and all the off scouring
[1:53:29] listen to this word off scouring which
[1:53:32] is wiped off
[1:53:35] dirt rubbed off
[1:53:37] scrapings
[1:53:39] so the scraps
[1:53:41] the dirt the grease
[1:53:45] the filth the off scouring
[1:53:50] the Athenians in order to avert public
[1:53:52] calamities yearly through a criminal
[1:53:56] into the sea
[1:53:59] as an offering to Poseidon
[1:54:01] hence the term become used for an
[1:54:05] expiratory offering
[1:54:08] or a ransom
[1:54:10] so Paul is looking at himself and the
[1:54:12] other brothers in the leadership of the
[1:54:15] church and said we are the filths and
[1:54:18] the off scouring
[1:54:21] we are an ax theater ransom for you
[1:54:25] as the bride
[1:54:29] oh my Lord
[1:54:33] let's read a couple more scriptures if
[1:54:35] you don't mind second Corinthians
[1:54:36] chapter one verse 3 blessed be God
[1:54:38] even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:54:41] the father of Mercies
[1:54:42] and the God of All Comfort
[1:54:45] who comforters Us in all our tribulation
[1:54:49] that we may be able to comfort them
[1:54:51] which are in any trouble
[1:54:54] by the Comfort we're with we ourselves
[1:54:58] are comforted of God you ever looked at
[1:55:00] it in the right way
[1:55:02] if there's anybody ought to be able to
[1:55:04] pray for somebody that's got cancer
[1:55:08] it'll be somebody that's got cancer
[1:55:11] or experience it and got healed or had a
[1:55:14] family member why they know a little bit
[1:55:17] about the pain if there's anybody that
[1:55:20] ought to be able to have a feeling for a
[1:55:22] caregiver of someone who's terminally
[1:55:25] ill it ought to be another caregiver
[1:55:28] that has to minister to a mother or a
[1:55:32] father or a child now notice Paul says
[1:55:35] then who comforteth Us in all of our
[1:55:38] tribulation that we may be able to
[1:55:41] comfort them which are in any trouble do
[1:55:44] you understand instead of us feeling
[1:55:47] sorry for ourselves whenever we go
[1:55:50] through so much stuff if we'd only read
[1:55:52] the scripture right we would realize God
[1:55:55] does not do this to put us all to where
[1:55:58] we live by ourselves excluded from
[1:56:00] everybody else the rest of our life but
[1:56:03] God wants us to connect with others who
[1:56:07] have been through a similar saying I'm
[1:56:10] not talking about a psychological
[1:56:12] therapy session I'm talking about a
[1:56:15] child of God ministering from their
[1:56:17] heart to another child of God no wonder
[1:56:20] the Bible says when job prayed for his
[1:56:24] friends God turned the Captivity of job
[1:56:27] why because God wanted him to reach out
[1:56:30] and realize the finale of his ultimate
[1:56:33] Victory is not pointing to himself but
[1:56:37] reaching out to others
[1:56:41] oh my
[1:56:43] for as the sufferings of Christ
[1:56:47] abound in US
[1:56:50] so our consolation also abound Us by
[1:56:55] Christ and whether we be afflicted it is
[1:56:59] for your consolation and salvation which
[1:57:02] is effectual in the enduring of the same
[1:57:04] sufferings which also we suffer for
[1:57:07] whether we be comforted it is for your
[1:57:10] consolation and salvation that I may
[1:57:13] know him and the power of his
[1:57:15] resurrection listen
[1:57:18] this is where the nominal Church stops
[1:57:22] that I may know him in the power of his
[1:57:25] resurrection the cross the cross the
[1:57:27] tomb the cross the tomb the cross the
[1:57:29] tomb the cross how many churches around
[1:57:31] Tri Cities today and that's as far as
[1:57:33] they ever appoint their people to I want
[1:57:35] to point you to the other part of that
[1:57:37] verse
[1:57:39] because I believe there's bride sitting
[1:57:41] here
[1:57:43] but I may know him in the power of his
[1:57:46] resurrection
[1:57:48] and the fellowship
[1:57:51] of his
[1:57:53] sufferings
[1:57:57] the fellowship
[1:58:00] of his sufferings
[1:58:03] several years ago I was a brother Fred
[1:58:05] Mullins the sister B down South Carolina
[1:58:07] I mean Carol
[1:58:09] and they began to tell us
[1:58:12] some of the things they went through
[1:58:14] as a young boy and a young man and young
[1:58:17] girl and a young woman
[1:58:18] of how they were treated
[1:58:21] by sometimes white people
[1:58:23] and how rough they treated him the names
[1:58:27] they used and the names and synonyms and
[1:58:29] things that they were called
[1:58:32] it absolutely broke my heart
[1:58:36] as I sat there tears welled up in my
[1:58:39] eyes
[1:58:40] as I heard
[1:58:42] what they had been through
[1:58:45] but yet in one sense of the word
[1:58:48] I could not relate
[1:58:50] because I'd never been called those
[1:58:52] names
[1:58:54] if brother Joel Brown would have been
[1:58:56] sitting there
[1:58:57] brother Joel is sitting at the same
[1:58:59] table
[1:59:00] he would no doubt be able to relate in a
[1:59:03] way
[1:59:04] that would be foreign altogether strange
[1:59:08] to me
[1:59:09] both of us humans
[1:59:11] both of us with feelings maybe he and I
[1:59:13] both sitting there were tears in her
[1:59:15] eyes but he would have flashbacks
[1:59:19] of his own things that he's been through
[1:59:21] for the same cause
[1:59:23] why because people have a race problem
[1:59:27] and I'll tell you there ain't no
[1:59:29] children of God full of the Holy Ghost
[1:59:30] has got a race problem if you claim to
[1:59:33] be a Christian you got a race problem
[1:59:34] you better get to Holy Ghost
[1:59:38] amen
[1:59:41] it would touch me and it did it broke my
[1:59:45] heart but brother Joel would have an
[1:59:47] affinity
[1:59:48] that I would not have don't you
[1:59:50] understand that's the way God was
[1:59:52] God could hear the anxieties of his
[1:59:54] people he could hear the trauma he could
[1:59:57] hear the wise and the wherefore he could
[1:59:59] hear all of that but he could not relate
[2:00:02] until one day he came down and sat down
[2:00:05] around the table himself
[2:00:07] and said now I know how John's going to
[2:00:09] feel now I know how Mark's gonna feel
[2:00:12] now I know how this man this woman now
[2:00:14] Brothers I know how you're going to feel
[2:00:16] when the prophet of God said he himself
[2:00:18] suffered
[2:00:20] sexual temptation
[2:00:22] listen if those words suffered
[2:00:25] suffered sexual Temptation you know as
[2:00:29] well as I do if you've ever had any bad
[2:00:32] Temptation there's some Temptation well
[2:00:34] it bothers you but there's others they
[2:00:36] actually cause you to suffer and the
[2:00:39] Lord Jesus allowed himself to suffer he
[2:00:44] allowed himself not only to get sick but
[2:00:46] to be tempted in such a degree that it
[2:00:49] caused him anxiety and stress
[2:00:53] and suffered
[2:01:01] second Corinthians
[2:01:03] chapter 1 verse 6 whether we be
[2:01:05] afflicted it is for your consolation and
[2:01:07] salvation
[2:01:09] notice Philippians 3 10 that I may know
[2:01:11] him and the power of His Resurrection
[2:01:13] The Fellowship of his sufferings being
[2:01:15] made conformable unto his death second
[2:01:18] Corinthians 4 8 we are troubled on every
[2:01:21] side yet not distressed let me close
[2:01:25] with this
[2:01:26] we are perplexed
[2:01:28] but not in despair
[2:01:31] I love this this is one of my favorite
[2:01:33] scriptures
[2:01:36] not forsaken you see no matter what
[2:01:40] you're going through
[2:01:42] if you look at it the right way there's
[2:01:45] a positive that always goes with your
[2:01:47] negative
[2:01:48] but if we're not careful we will focus
[2:01:51] only on the negative so let's focus on
[2:01:53] the negatives in this verse
[2:01:55] persecuted
[2:01:58] cast down
[2:02:01] always bang about in the body
[2:02:03] beat whipped made fun of suffered
[2:02:07] stripes
[2:02:09] now if that's all we want to focus on we
[2:02:11] can
[2:02:12] or we can focus on the rest of the truth
[2:02:15] persecuted
[2:02:17] but not forsaken
[2:02:20] glory to God how many can say Amen to
[2:02:22] that
[2:02:23] stand to your feet if you have been
[2:02:26] persecuted but not forsaken by the grace
[2:02:29] of God
[2:02:31] how many of you can say by the grace of
[2:02:33] God I've been cast down
[2:02:36] but not destroyed
[2:02:38] Oh Glory how many has been run down run
[2:02:42] over and everything else but not give up
[2:02:44] by the grace of God have you felt like
[2:02:47] it oh sure those times you felt like it
[2:02:49] but something down inside of you would
[2:02:51] not let go well he said glory to God
[2:02:53] I'll tell you one thing I made up my
[2:02:54] mind to quit which time yeah I'm glad it
[2:02:57] ain't determined by us making up our
[2:02:59] mind he made up his mind before I had a
[2:03:02] mind
[2:03:03] always bearing about in the body the
[2:03:06] dying of the Lord Jesus
[2:03:09] bearing about in the body the dying of
[2:03:13] the Lord Jesus
[2:03:15] that the life also of Jesus might be
[2:03:19] made manifest in our body
[2:03:23] for which we live and are always
[2:03:27] delivered unto death
[2:03:30] for Jesus sake that the life also of
[2:03:34] Jesus might be made manifest in our
[2:03:39] mortal flesh
[2:03:45] so then death worketh in US
[2:03:48] but life
[2:03:50] in you
[2:03:52] verse 15.
[2:03:54] for all sayings are for your sakes that
[2:03:57] the abundant grace matter the
[2:03:59] Thanksgiving Amendment down to the glory
[2:04:01] of God for which court call us we thank
[2:04:04] not but though our outward men perish
[2:04:08] get the inward man is renewed day by day
[2:04:12] now listen at all these things that I
[2:04:15] have described
[2:04:16] and listens the way that he puts it up
[2:04:18] in verse 17 for our light affliction
[2:04:24] which is but for
[2:04:25] a moment
[2:04:29] all of that hey I ain't even finished
[2:04:31] with it I'll wait till we get to more of
[2:04:33] it there's more yet to come
[2:04:35] and he called that a light Affliction
[2:04:38] it's a man in time looking to Eternity
[2:04:41] and comparing what eternity is going to
[2:04:43] give to what he went through in time and
[2:04:46] he said it ain't even nothing it's like
[2:04:48] it is it's but for a moment oh it'll
[2:04:51] pass away so fast
[2:04:52] [Applause]
[2:04:55] praise God
[2:04:57] asparagus
[2:05:02] Lord Jesus
[2:05:05] thank you Lord God
[2:05:10] father we love you today
[2:05:14] Lord I'm sure that
[2:05:16] under the sound of my voice in the
[2:05:18] visible audience and invisible as well
[2:05:20] Lord many have been through so many
[2:05:23] things
[2:05:25] Lord I'm not talking about
[2:05:26] self-inflicted or things that we've
[2:05:29] caused and brought upon ourself but
[2:05:31] since being your children
[2:05:34] oh Lord God
[2:05:36] we have to be honest with you Lord we
[2:05:38] don't always understand why you do what
[2:05:40] you do
[2:05:41] but we have to trust you and know your
[2:05:44] ways are absolutely perfect
[2:05:48] oh man what a contrast between the
[2:05:52] service last Sunday morning
[2:05:55] live Sunday morning when we saw Esther
[2:05:59] going up to her position to be crowned
[2:06:03] my we all rejoiced it praise God
[2:06:08] now this Sunday morning we're brought
[2:06:10] back down to the journey
[2:06:12] to get from the summons to the crown
[2:06:16] we endure a little bit more about the
[2:06:18] suffering and the
[2:06:19] the problems that we in face are that
[2:06:22] sometimes engulf Our Lives
[2:06:25] Lord and we have to be honest with you
[2:06:28] we don't always know how you're going to
[2:06:30] move or when you're going to move
[2:06:32] we just believe you will
[2:06:34] in your time
[2:06:37] I don't think there's any of us here
[2:06:39] today Lord
[2:06:41] that would want to walk down streets of
[2:06:43] gold I don't think there's any of us
[2:06:45] here today that would want to walk into
[2:06:47] the paradise of God and have to be
[2:06:50] babied that you kept every trial and
[2:06:53] every test away from us
[2:06:55] but I dare say there's probably just as
[2:06:57] many that would say Lord
[2:06:59] I'd rather you didn't take my husband
[2:07:02] I'd rather you didn't take my wife
[2:07:05] God don't take one of my children
[2:07:08] God don't let me have a terminal
[2:07:10] sickness where I'll be sick for years on
[2:07:12] end please God I beg you don't
[2:07:16] and I'm so glad Lord that if we would
[2:07:18] even think such a thing that you look
[2:07:19] down on us and you say
[2:07:21] I understand
[2:07:24] for you yourself
[2:07:26] did not want to go to Calvary
[2:07:30] you did not want to die
[2:07:34] the prophet said you loved your
[2:07:36] disciples
[2:07:37] and you didn't want to leave them
[2:07:40] y'all had gotten so close and you were
[2:07:42] the best of friends
[2:07:44] and you didn't want to have to leave
[2:07:46] them
[2:07:48] so you prayed if it be thy will let this
[2:07:51] cup pass from me
[2:07:55] Lord Jesus thank you for understanding
[2:07:57] our Humanity
[2:08:00] But ultimately what we want
[2:08:02] is for you to have your way
[2:08:05] and our lives Lord God
[2:08:09] Hallelujah
[2:08:12] how many be willing with me this morning
[2:08:13] just to raise your hand and say Lord
[2:08:15] here I am
[2:08:17] take me use me
[2:08:18] whatever you want and keep in mind
[2:08:20] friends before you do that the will of
[2:08:23] God will never lead you for the grace of
[2:08:26] God cannot keep you
[2:08:28] well brother Donnie I'm afraid what if
[2:08:30] he does this or that well if he does
[2:08:32] you found confidence and you found favor
[2:08:35] in his eyes
[2:08:36] there's only one job in the Old
[2:08:38] Testament
[2:08:39] or is only one there's only one blind
[2:08:42] man like this God knows what you can go
[2:08:44] through and don't don't ever get under
[2:08:46] that fear
[2:08:47] oh God what if God will do this what if
[2:08:49] God will do that don't live under that
[2:08:51] fear just live under Trust
[2:08:54] knowing that if he allows you to go on
[2:08:56] this track and this path
[2:08:58] he's using it for a purpose and he'll
[2:09:01] help you and he'll strengthen you
[2:09:03] and when you get there that day he will
[2:09:05] reward you
[2:09:06] for your pain and use your suffering
[2:09:09] because you submitted
[2:09:12] to his will

[2:09:29] for him

[2:09:33] you didn't understand why I took her but
[2:09:35] I had a reason
[2:09:37] and I saw my greater glory
[2:09:40] and I saw the greater good
[2:09:42] but I'm going to add this to your record
[2:09:45] I saw the tears you cried
[2:09:48] I saw the lonely nights that you spent
[2:09:51] I saw the days when you run your hands
[2:09:54] and you said I'm finished Lord
[2:09:56] I have nothing else to live for
[2:09:59] I have no more joy in my life
[2:10:02] I will reward you today my daughter
[2:10:05] for your sacrifice I will reward you my
[2:10:07] son

[2:11:47] them there that day and you went with
[2:11:49] them to jariah's house
[2:11:51] and whenever you said she is not dead
[2:11:53] she's only asleep and they left you to
[2:11:56] scorn and the prophet said it
[2:11:58] embarrassed you
[2:12:00] so your face turned red
[2:12:03] so whenever people say things to us
