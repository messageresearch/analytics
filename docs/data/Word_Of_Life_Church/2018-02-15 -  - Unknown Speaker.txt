human beings but beneath all that humanity there's a seat of God there cries out for more of it praise God why you're standing with us today we're gonna go to the book of second Samuel chapter 23 second samuel chapter 23 when we look at verse 14 first 13 we'll read down to verse 17 this morning that i want to read a statement to you now the message feast of the trumpets 2nd samuel chapter 23 verse 13 and three of the thirty chief went down and came to david in the harvest time and to the cave of a deulim the troop of the philistines pitched in the valley arif um-- and david was then in a hold and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem and David longed it means desired he craved a painful desire and David longed and said old that one would give me a drink of the water of the will of Bethlehem which is by the gate and the three mighty men what's the Bible's he talks about these men three mighty men break through the host of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate they took it and they brought it to David never less he would not drink thereof but he poured it out into the Lord and he said be it far from me O Lord that I should do this is not this the blood of men that went in jeopardy of their lives therefore he would not drink it these things did these three mighty men amen in the feast of the trumpets laram tells us the big fifty days has passed over the Pentecostal feast has passed over seven Sabbath's he said are you listening the congregation says Amen under the sixth trumpet the Pentecostals reject the Bible the lukewarm not only Pentecostals but all the rest the church world rejects Christ and he's put on the outside and the same seal rather when it was open to show Jesus on the outside of the church trying to get back in at the same time and brother him says the trumpet sounds for the Jews of the Jews recognized the atonement all glory hallelujah all mine now watch what he says the holy spirit has been bound by these denominational rivers for almost 2,000 years but it's to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the Holy Spirit back in the church again now watch who it's going to be in these mighty men Christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time he said it he promised it amen I like to use this for a subject this morning the Kings desire the Kings desire let's just buy our hearts now the Kings desire Heavenly Father Lord as we are able to come into this place today with Thanksgiving in our hearts and Lord how that we've sang Lord and expressed our love and gratitude towards you we're asking that you would just come now Lord for the most important part of any service and that's the breaking of the bread of life may you come Lord and may you not just anoint me but Lord we all want to be anointed I pray Lord that you would just catch us all up together in heaven places in Christ this morning and Lord may we just bind the enemy may we lock him outside of this building now Lord that our thoughts and our minds could just be centered they can just be focused on you today and Lord for those Lord that are streaming and listening to this service we ask the Lord that you would just move or their ass some is sick not able to be here I asked Lord that you would go over there at may the warmth of the Holy Spirit move upon them lord help us that we can look within the scripture today Lord and help us not just to see the prophet Lord not just being able to see Lord different parts of the scripture but let me see myself in the words help me to recognize Lord I got something to do I must believe in this our Lord we ask that you had come now take control we pray in Jesus Christ's name and everybody said amen god bless you you may have your seats for a few moments the king's desire the Kings desire I'm sure this thought has been looked at many times but I want to take it from this angle of the desire that the King would have and take these men of David and just take and show you what the Prophet said I'm concerning these men and I've been listening to the message while little Bethlehem of course we all know why that God chose Bethlehem and those those things that the Prophet laid out and I wanted to try to take and bring this parallel if I can and I want to use it from some statements that brother venom is making concerning you and I and the Pergamon Church agent but the RAM said I want you to notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until first it was showed to him by the father that's John 5:19 this army now is to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for it the see be planted watch brother found now if the CP planted the water will raise it again and here is the secret of this the word is in the bride and as it wasn't married he said the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the Lord then the word is quickened by the Spirit and then it comes to pass like a seed that's planted in the water it comes to full harvests serving its purpose those in the bride knew only his will and no one can make them do otherwise they have dust set the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all of his work while he was here in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must do now but he will now fulfill through that bride the work which was left for this specific time we know that but the RAM brings a parallel of that story of these mighty men of David and he brings it right down to the time that we are living in right now and we know scripturally we know prophetically that we are living in the closing moments of the Gentile dispensations there is no more ages after this there's no more Church ages to come brother this is the final scene of the play amen and we know that about living in this time we are aware of that by scripture by prophecy that we are living in the time of the harvest we have come through the fall we've come through the winter we've seen the resurrection of the spring we've actually sit underneath the the more a the teaching rain but now that time is over we come to the time of the harvest and we know that this is the hour that has been promised throughout all the scripture every type of the Bible his vein manifests right before us today every scriptural type that laid in the Old Testament it's coming to pass right before our eyes today we are living in a time where the lamb has calm and he took the book out of the right hand of him that has sit on the throne and not only has he took the book but we've seen a mighty angel that has descended in this hour with that same book that is disclosed it's now often in the hand of the angel and we know this is the hour that that book comes down and he gives it to the seventh angel the seventh angel takes that book and he begins to reveal it to the people and I believe were the people that are the recipients of this book this is the hour that the word has come to not just a partial restoration we are not just in a partial deliverance but he's bringing a total deliverance and we're living in our that we have come to know that the completeness of the word it's coming to a full restoration and now it's embodied in a living group of people who is standing where no other age has ever been able to stand I know you we're standing at a time oh my where no other people's been able to see and look upon what you and I have been blessed to look upon and we're not just any people we're not just another group or not just another church but I want to say this we're not just another Gentiles we're elected Jintao's not just any jintao but I'll say we are those who has been elected we are those who are being called by Almighty God we are those who are predestinated we are those who are chosen by God I challenge you to believe that today oh we are those people who was all caught up in the grip of denomination and organization but we are those Gentiles who heard the voice of the seventh angel we've been called out of Laodicea we've been called out the darkness in this hour we be called out all kinds of creeds and dogmas and we've coming in to the fresh kill the man of the word of God's OMA we've been called out of every system from every walk of life and we know that we are not just people we are the allotted Gentiles that has come down now at the climax of the seven ages all glory and we are the last Jin we are not just chit toss it's a special group it's a special people living in a special hour a supernatural time where God's going to move in a supernatural way on a supernatural Church given her supernatural power to overcome the wiles of the devil in this hour oh we're the last Gentiles who's going to hear from God like no other age he's been able to hear from God Oh notice in the scripture he'll that the scripture says these are mighty men these are mighty men and I want to say this we're not just another people we are mighty Gentile warriors oh we're not your David had a lot of orders they'd fought with him from time to time but we're not just taught with Elia just Elia David Smith we are those men who heard the desire of the kings Oh God let me say this we're the Warriors that are fighting for the king all David had some me and some Gentiles who just heard the desire of the king and these men come for revelation that's who we are we're the people who stop the revelation of the hour where the Gentiles who's standing here believing the Word of God for this day all the stand no other Church is being able to stand and look upon what your eye is able to look upon and the understanding and the revelations coming now oh I'm blessed we are to be able to see it program tells us the message marriage and divorce is I lay my foundation David said David just a little fella all that they seamless of this they seen the man was in here and they see that God was in him and they know that he was coming into power some day hey man somebody these men recognize that David was anointed king now let me lay this out David had not been crowned kings but David was the anointed king but David is going to be crowned king it's already been written it's already been prophesied by the prophets chained up David was gonna be King one day but to be king you've got to receive a crown to be king oh he says they sing that God was with him they knowed he was coming to power and once Oh listen about these men but him says one slew them one slew their mother five brothers of Goliath hallelujah not just eating meat at 90 men me and who took the rest of them Giants oh I feel like preaching that this morning that same anointing that was upon David got over all these men that same anointing that was on the anointed king and got over on these Mia and they went no man too big they went no job too big but no gonna be true great that these men wasn't willing to stand there and fight oh yeah girl I've had some brothers but these mighty me and took care of them he bought these five brothers a glass single-handed One Killed 300 men when some of the women was picking some beans for dinner in the army had gone away he took a spear killed 300 men Philistines you told my character why I stayed they stayed right with David they stayed right by David they know the anointing was upon him oh they know the anointing was upon David the annuity was upon that word the anointing was upon that king and they know that kidding though it looked like there was no way it could happen in the time of impossibility that he had a special revelation that David was gonna be crowned king and they stand right beside David they stood right by David they know the anointing was upon him by now he was coming into power oh can you say man for that we now he's coming into power and program says a pure picture of the church today that'll stand by the word we know it's going to be made vindicated we know it's coming into power someday although he was a fugitive from the rest of the nations but they knowed he was coming into power we know he's coming into power we know they know they don't we know he's coming into power so we take that word and stand right there no matter what it cost if we have to cut Philistines jump into a pit and kill a lion has one deal we'll go anyhow because that's the way God designed it to be we're not just at this place my chance we're not just living in this moment by chance this is design the almighty caught but I wasn't just chosen to live in any hour he wasn't just chosen to live in any day I was designed by God to live in this time to live in this day and stay for this moment to stand by our king that's coming to power [Applause] will be it according the scripture that would be set apart think about it the scripture intent in it the scripture on purpose sets these men apart and calls them mighty men men that the word would exalt to such a place such a position no glory to God all God's not just gonna have people in this hour he's gonna have mighty people not just a church he's gonna have a mighty church I'd rather have a bunch of weakened and old fogey Church that came Harley yet for one day to the next he's gonna have some victorious people he's gonna have some overcoming people he's gonna have some people's when I take that word and they gonna go to the enemy's camp show me and we'll go the enemy's camp mighty people for the scripture says that were a chosen people you believe that Oh first Peter says it like this concerning you and I that you are a chosen generation you're a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in times past we weren't a lot of people but we are now the people of God which obtain mercy oh my which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy he noticed Peter says we're a chosen people which means we are elected were chosen by God to obtain salvation across we are Christians that's chosen or elect the Messiah in called the elect we are being appointed by God to the most exalted office conceivable not just a reform age not in the later Reformation but the people whose been restored back through the original world back to the original see what he has the original seed a spoken word is the original seed and will restored back to that original it means the best of its kind of class applied to certain individual Christians however yes oh he's calling us today we've been hand-picked for this day I've been hand-picked for this moment I've been called for this hour I've been called to living this day I couldn't have lived any the other day he saw me overcoming in this age he saw you victorious he saw you triumph over the enemy in this age can you handle that today bring your hand I'll be calling you that you're a chosen people not only are you a priesthood you're I of priesthood how can Gentiles which had no covenant with God a people that was not even worthy of the gospel all right how can the people in know rise but no covenant with God how can they be called and exalted so high it's because of not who I am it's who I've always was because who I am sometimes differs and it looks different from who I always was hallelujah somebody that's why we disagree with nearly every denomination they say that when the rapture takes place you're getting the body of the future but only in this hour did a prophet come and say you're not getting a body in the future you're getting a body down with some a eternal in the heavens but they don't you see we're standing where no other hour has been able to see the revelation that you and I see in this hour pull through the word we found our place by the word we found our position hey man the watch because the scripture said which in tongues pass we were not of people but are now the people of God which have attained which not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy in times past we were neither people come on somebody but we are now the people of God that means for this present occasion God has chosen us for this time right here these men these men of David are oh my these men for him touch them as Gentiles that has come under the king's command he touched them according to scripture it's me in that head follow David all the way to the end flourish but I begin to think where did these men come from to be able to come to this place and to to find that just follow me there's been a transition of power and there's being a prophet that has anointed a man to come to a position that is greater than man's choice which was sold for lunch but we move past man's choice and we come to God's choice where are these men come from that that they're not under the administration of solve but they are chosen means who plans to serve underneath David Bible says it like this what's very closely and subversive no twenty two and one and David therefore deport advance and escape to the cave of a deulim and when his brother and all his father's house heard it they went down there to him and when his brethren lauric with his brethren and all his father's house heard it they went down to him and everyone now watch these men and every one of them what that was in distress everyone that was in debt everyone that was discontented power to God gathered themselves together and he became a captain over them and there were with him about four hundred men look at these men that starts following David they was men of distress they was mere that was bound with a debt that they could not pay come on somebody they was me and that was discontinued all don't you see the picture today that sounds like you and I people that was under distress people who was in bondage and in debt of debt we could not pay but we started following David and by the time David got down with them they were familiar death to male-male as our fight will get from sissies to Mali men hallelujah stay away from me with pressures and debts and sickness and disease though in David got done with them they was my team and my Legion towers hallelujah hallelujah well you think about that you started out as a sinner in debt then with all kinds of sin bound with all kinds of doubts all kinds of unbelief but after Jesus got a hold of Hugh and because he's got a power to transform I said he's got a power of transformation he can transform you from an old Gentile any man dressed in rags to the Queen of Heaven the queen of Almighty God any man somebody all you and I the way I started he's not the way I'm gonna finish way I started in this thing it away were finishing I started out just for no sorry Gentile when I got done I was a mighty gym towel warrior another whenever I got to hanging around David a man I got to see in the anointing that was so fun David how David could stay a hell David Correia how David could Mars how David could fine I got some of that of northern over on me they begin to transform me into a mighty warrior for God for Peter said which in times past were not a people but are now the people of God which whole list of this now I have obtained mercy I don't know about you that makes me feel good because I obtained mercy I said it was mercy that changed my life it was mercy that rewrote my life it was grace that picked me up it was grace that transformed me and brought me to what he called me to be grace picked me up and carried me back to what I was called to me Paul says like this in Ephesians worn according as he's chosen us in him before the foundation of world and we should be wholly without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to the good pleasures of his will of his will it wasn't my will when your will write the pastor's will it was God's will for you to come to this don't you see it was God's will and David would have somebody Jintao warriors was God's will that done it to the praise of the glory of His grace this of this wherein he has made me made me I wasn't acceptable but he made me acceptable talk about a power transformation I was not acceptable he magic forward to God through Christ he made me because of his grace because of his mercy and we have obtained his Trent house we was not a worthy people but he made us worthy to serving where is he made us sit in the beloved the word made means to be highly favored to make accepted to make not that she was to make graceful he wasn't lovely un charming you ain't even agreeable you couldn't even agree with yourself thank you lord that's a given right there hey man the worst argument you'll ever have is with yourself cuz you never gonna win hey man we was in love link all right calmly punch oh my think about it Freitas we was not agreeable but he made me agreeable what had God had to do for us he had to pursue with grace he can past me with his favor to honor me with his blessings oh he transformed us I don't know about you but he I wasn't graceful but he made me in for this then Paul picks it up like this and in chapter 2 of Ephesians and you hath he quickened who was dead in trespasses and sins where in times past he walked according to the rest of this world I meant somebody according to the Prince of the power of air the spirit now worketh in the children disobedience he was not the children of disobedience but at one time we was disobedient children among among whom also we all had our conversation times past did you see if this was you lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh from the mind and worry about not by seat now but by nature by seed I was elected by seeing I was predestinated that seed I was chosen I God but my nature I had the same nature when I come to this world just like you did our nature was to children last here's the difference but he's a God who is rich in mercy oh he can be rich in a lot of things he's not just rich in monetary things but when it comes to notice when David begins to describe God he said he's a God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even so when we were dead in sins he's quickened us who and has quickened us together with Christ by grace are saved and he's raised us up together and made us to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that's my position but the RAM said my position is in Christ he has quickened me he has raised me he has made me he's accepted me I've been accepted in the beloved because of what he's done for me oh my here David has some men and the scripture depicts to us is the Prophet brings this thought to us and he says I want you to notice now the Bible tells us it was the time of harvest when these Gentiles was following David the Bible says in second same for 23:13 and three of the thirty chief went down and came to David in the harvest town so here during the harvest three warriors come to David these Gentile Warriors they had just been sitting around now they ain't just been just waiting for what happens but if this for the scripture they had been fighting and the scripture tells us and gives us the synopsis of what these men had been doing and I want to tell you they've been fighting some things but not only had they been fighting they've been overcoming but remember says like this make eternal life and during this time be a fugitive from his people talk about David he picked up many gallons Jintao's and one of them one of them killed 800 men one day with a spirit of sword another one jumped into a pit killed a lion on a snowy day and they was gathering the little which was being for peace something like that and all them run away and he stood and he stood when everybody else during the harvest time what's turning away I said when people was walking away from the Word of God has been revealed in this hour that's mad stunt bro that preaches all by itself when people in this hours putting their back away from the gospel turning their back away from the message of the hour God had a man God's kind of people God's got an elected number who's gonna stand with everybody else turns around if they leave let them leave I'm standing here for the cause of the gospel if they quit let him quit I'm standing for this message he stood and count men his arm got tired they also killed those giant brothers of Goliath I'm preaching about somebody today I'm talking about me in who's fighting some Giants in their lives and talking about me and who's fighting some big things men that's battling people women young people who's standing in this hour not just walking not just wandering standing four pumps in having done all to stand let us stand hey kill those giant brothers took alive gallant men holding to David these are the kind of people that follows David not wimps not Mama's boys not start till holders come on somebody hang on now not people it's all wrapped up in fear I'm just telling you this is what Barry I'm top these men were gallant man and brother am said they took an even kill Goliath us they heard that David killed a lot and they said the same anointing that's on the oh come on now the same spirit that was on Jesus it raised him from the dead that same spirit told me it's gonna quick and meek but I will say if that's the same spirit it's on my lord I got the same spirit he did and cannot the work do the same thing every time if you can apropriate the faith to believe it the world I gotta do the same thing every time [Applause] hallelujah not a bunch of people feared coward down line in a foxhole somewhere a brother these are talented me and Gentile warriors they'd heard how David had overcome de lies and faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the acts of Almighty God hey man and that same anointing got over on the Emma and they single oz brothers and let me say this because they know that that victory stood that day and that same God was walking and talking in them that same warrior had been born and birth inside of them the realist and in fact I hope today somebody of this building as well to stand in fact they've been fighting some Giants of their own brother Ram takes that event of david's mighty men and brings that top right down to this hour hey man now watch David had been anointed as the king in Bethlehem and Bethlehem is the house all right it's the house of God spread pellets you're gonna feed from the bran of God you got to do it in Bethlehem so fitting it's the bread of Bethlehem oh my can you imagine why had to be why little bit Levin says why why I don't know Bethlehem his brother said that was the bread place of the world and what a better fitting place could it be that in Bethlehem was born David's son which was Jesus Christ which was the house of God's bread for jesus said take my body for in his bread eat of it Jesus is the bread sinner of the elbe world hey man somebody and here David being God's anointed did not come to be crowned king but was anointed king watch now that he brought this time where he had been driven out because of the jealousy among his churches his brethren a man somebody and because of jealousy David had become Bodrum uses this terminology if you look it up David had become a fugitive to his own place he was fugitive from his own town ohhohh he was a fugitive from his own family a fugitive from his own brad ina Forman Bethlehem Norton in Bethlehem but now he's a fugitive from Bethlehem and brother Graham tells us that like this and there's a main concern a lot they're topping David which was a fugitive at the time of the excommunicating from his people he was turned out and Bethlehem was besieged and the Philistines was garrisoned around Bethlehem again he says what time are we living in all of this quote what time are we living in what's the sign that God said he would show last before it come to pass what was the things he said here's real whole listen now watch him now tell him if a fig tree in Israel how that when Jesus said when you see the fig tree putting forth its buds you know that summer is nigh and a summer is a type of the rapture and he's letting you know and you see that season when you see that hour when you see Israel getting ready the rapture is at hand he says what time we live in him what was the things he said Israel in her place over Endor the fake tree restoring its or so back again look everything just exactly sitting in line brother you may think things is just a mess and everything's out line I differ from me it's exactly in line ma'am and this message I was listening to this morning about him said Omaha notice it's setting itself in line and Burrell said here David was he was anointed king of Aram says who cares who becomes presidents we know who the king is but what's it matter who gets it if you get the king just let me add the king look at everything just exactly sitting in line oh my it almost sounds prophetic this morning setting a line of the church the church and the layout of see a condition Jesus on the outside of fugitive to his own church just as David was up at Bethlehem a fugitive from his own people a fugitive and cross the Bible sin the last days was a fugitive to his own people they're in Revelation in the third chapter let's see age that we're living in cross is on the outside knocking over em sez trying to get in a fugitive to his own people but these men didn't see fugitive these men could only see the revelation of Kings that's the difference maker they knew David was coming into power one day and they chose to stand with David even though they'd have to stand alone sometimes preach until you now come on somebody they know they have to stand by themselves sometimes yeah they're gonna be looked at strange sometimes but they're standing by David even though it looked as if David had been defeated and it looked like the world was going to take over and it looked like Satan was gonna be victorious it looked like David was gonna be overcome but even though no matter what it looked like even though every circumstance was against them they chose the stand beside David it was during that time of the harvest it was during that time of wars and rumors of wars it was during that time that David had a desire in his heart oh what's where it comes in now and they were so close to David these men was so in tune with David oh how can I say it to make you see it they become so long with the word of the hour they become anointed with his desire or to God even though there was a great challenge before the hill they didn't care how big the challenge was they was only interested in fulfilling the Kings desire River says a perfect picture of revelation three brilliant said cross on the outside force in relations 320 behold I says the door knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I'll come in to him and will sup with him and he with me what he's saying is if the door becomes open I'll have communion with you the king was designed for a time of communion Oh God just like his he did with Abraham half to the battle after the battle he had communion with Abraham I feel the Holy Spirit I said the last thing that Elohim did with Abraham was he had communion but that we are living in the hour of the repeating of the Son of man ministry what has come to life in this hour I can prove that to you by your Bible what's the last thing that Elohim did with Abraham had communion what's the last thing Jesus did with his disciples had communion what's the last sermon for the Wrentham preached Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] we commune with the king because we want to know his desires Judith she's telling us on his own church Oh or one time David would be welcome he's been set outside and besides heaven David they took it in Creed's they've taken in dogmas they've got church programs they got men standing in the place of God I'm preaching somebody I'm told matter in this hour right now and I want to say this because they have accepted something else they made him a fugitive from his own church I may get tough for a minute but hang on somebody he's a fugitive from his own people instead of drinking from the well of Bethlehem they've turned what I've said to some stagnated cistern of yesterday a man some a water of days gone by they refuse the water from the well of Bethlehem a man they won't accept him as Hebrews 13:8 they were accepting this revelation 10 one through seven they want to tell us that Oh healing signs miracles that's just for the apostles and days going by come on somebody well one acts 2:38 in their church because they don't like the way it makes them act but he called it acts and I just want to be a part of the Acts they meant somebody they think Malachi 4 well that's just John the Baptist Luke 17 30s not for this day hey man stagnated sessions I'm drinking from a water that has decomposed and it's ruining their shows and take them straight to the lake afar well that may sound tough today but I don't think you can get too tough when you're talking about something the devil's pull the wool over their eyes I'm not just people the world the people run around our message that accept some doctrine over Jesus Christ help set some man and play between them and God hey man somebody they want to be called to so they wanna be called parousia they wouldn't be colanders they wanna have a name brother let me say this I want the desire the King inside my heart another man I don't want another sister I don't want another whale I want the whale from the fam oh I feeling driving me this morning I had 10,000 voices I couldn't say loud enough I'd made him a fugitive from his own church gotta bring it home can't leave it underneath organizations can't leave it outside this ranks what do you think these people has turned their back on this message what do you think they've done I made him a fugitive oh but don't you see the only thing you've done is separate yourself father I'll tell you why because of the our or living in where God was gonna send David among us through the Ministry of the Son of Man which was gonna be a manifestation of God through a vindicated prophet though the office of a vindicated prophet they turned down Christ now he's become foreign to them the fugitive all but during the first pool and the second pull of his ministry oh how with open arms they welcomed the signs and the wonders and the fishes and the loaves as we say oh my how they welcomed it all please come heal our sick come and help our people that's needful come among us honey first from Singapore they wanted their names called how they wanted to hear it they wanted to sign the hand whoa but that was only bait on the hook brother em said that was only something to attract the people's attention but it wasn't a tension to try to get them just to recognize what God can do in a great way but they was trying to get them to recognize the David the ministry the son of man was standing in our midst and the Pentecostals rejected the message of the hour oh how they loved him under son of God they loved him under ministry of son of God they loved the break of the bread but when he moved when the seven seals come open and he moves from Son of God ministry to the Son of man ministry and Christ begin to unveil himself and let his mister become known that's when they rejected him better in preach the message present stage of my ministry oh man he tells us through the message how that the shuck has pulled back my brother the shucks has pulled back it's got a reveal something who's a girl reveal some Gentile lawyers some Gentiles who's gonna stand some Gentiles he's gonna believe brother him said the only thing I know that the we has to do he said that wheats gotta lay in the presence of the Sun to wrap it into mature hey man and now here comes David during the time of the harvest and these Gentile Warriors are now they're coming to David and while his ministry had been rejected they hear David say something what's the timing after the rejecting of the word of God for this day David begins to express something that he hadn't expressed before but no God now that he's coming to the climax he's coming to the Paramount of his ministry now he begins to say something and breathe something for his lives he hasn't said before never drink I could just have a drink I remember brother Graham says at that point right there is where David wrote Psalms 42 as the deer pants for the water so does my soul brother Vance it was and David was at the cape of a deulim it's where he writes Psalms forty to watch after the word had been rejected now his soul is calling out for something the word was calling for the word now he's looking for revelation to match his revelation fed up with those old waters stagnation but all and the point of harvest time verbum says the Sun was shining real hot down on David because that's when the week begins to mature is when the Sun begins the Sun and it was during that season during that time that David began to remember how God hallelujah Dave had begin to remember oh god somebody help me he begin to remember the water and they begin to remember there's something promise for this day he begins to remember there's somebody who's gonna stand he begins to remember the water from the well of Bethlehem when the tassel and the shucks was drying up David began to remember him he don't want just any water he wants a water that can match the thirst whoo God he was a water that can match the the Stars the desire the longing of his soul he wants a soul to match his soul he wants a people who's hungry for the revelation of God's words he's wanting some of that original water but the problem was he wasn't gonna be easy now let me preach to you now it ain't gonna be easy yeah you're gonna fight some batters you're gonna go through some stuff they were some Philistines that was blocking the well can I preach this it was during the time of the harvest that the enemy was coming against them the greatest come on somebody under the breaking of the seals there's been a supernatural demons released and now they're standing between you and the whale 100 the minister the rejection of the word hood Christ has been put outside the church yes when Gentile orders begin a raise up I said there's a New Testament church it's rising up for the Redman want a little Bethlehem well hurry he said if I only had a drink listen to this inside of him cried out what programs say this mystery was as the mystery that was hidden his heart all right and from his being he begin to cry out if I could only drink once more from that well at Bethlehem listen this statement this is why priestess his desire was a commandment to those who loved it's not just a social religion not some social gospel they come around but when they heard him say this from his being his dessert just his desire his side his desire if I could just have a drink they heard him they heard that revelation and something stuck inside of them if the king wants the king go get what his desire is it's me come on it's our is it's our was a commitment to those who loved him remember his soul was crying for a drink of water his cell was and those who loved him his least his desire was a command again why a little bit lehem 63 David here's a type of Christ in Bethlehem because christ is david's son this and david's crying for drinking water desire was a command i said to those who loved him three of those men watch this the first thing that happens under the ministry the son of man during the time of the harvest when the shucks is pulled away here is some gentiles that here's the desire David's heart and when he decides what he wants they pull the sword first pull and second pull has went by come on somebody and now the Kings sword has come down into the hands come on church under the ministry the sentiment the anointing is fell and when they see him desiring this they pulled the swords those men pulled their swords and fought 15 miles of men down to that city watch while others fought keeping them or gallant fighting men those Philistines twice their size some of them but it was during that time the King had a desire in a time where it looked impossible there's no way that anybody's ever gonna have a rapture it's impossible that anybody's gonna leave here like this but where there was impossibility with man there's impossibility with God where it looks like their circumstances bucking the way a man there's no circumstance considered when it comes to God told rogram said oh during this time they were sold one with the king it become a personal ambition to fulfill the Kings desire a man church now watch and for the last fifty seven years we've been fighting our way to that whale brother you want to know why it's been so hard you're fighting a lot of Philistines we've been there we fought our way to this whale we have fought off spirit after spirit we fought off depression and all kinds of things of the world we have fought them off hey man somebody while we find more we're trying to fulfill the keys this hour trying to manifest the word we fought all kinds of Philistines I sleep I say we've slayed some things some of them nots late last night in this building when slates and polygamy Philistines we've slayed some too so Philistines we placed some return ministry Philistines we slayed some too so doctrines we're just having fun now hang on we slayed some things around this message and we found our way back to the original well whether we fought our way back to this will we find a way all the way down to this place we get down there we take this bucket we throw it down in that whale and we've let it down in there oh my I feel Poole something's on the end of this I [Applause] said something's on the end of this we've studied one sermon after another after another after another and finally we got we kept dropping our bucket down the whale until finally the bucket become full because he feels all alone then we started dragging this bucket back up come in come on somebody I say there's some pressure on this rope there's some pressure against that whale and that old buckets just dragging up the side that way I ran it to finally by Lake after fifteen miles of fightin dory your eyes behold the Kings desire well I think we should just give up and just quit are you kidding me you mean after all this fighting all these years you're ready to give up now by the fun ain't even started yet alright can you imagine them standing there sweat dripping off of them maybe their closes wet their tired blood dripping off the end of their sword glory he pulled that bucket up I'd behold the water now listen to the desire of the Kings soul is in these Gentiles hands that's just too good man listen the fulfillment of the Kings desire was resting on these men these Gentile Warriors who's standing here in the time of the harvest they've got the manifestation of the word it's in their hands Oh God what we gonna do now you want to give up you'll quit we'll stop fighting no odds was considered they're not considering circumstances they're not considering how bad the trials are going to be they're not considering how bad the test is going to be they're not considering how big the Philistines are going to be they're anointed but the Kings desire now listen and now we're fighting our way back we're on our way back to the king we're on our way back to our king oh ma why don't we get discouraged just look over in that bucket over there while they get depressed just peek over into that bucket and see that water glory to God if I get tired I just got to look in the bucket if I get down I'm gonna look in the bucket flowery will we get sick just look at the fulfillment of the revelation of the hour I'm reminded of the Kings desires I'm running with some water I'm running with a message I'm fighting with water man and I'm making sure there's not one drop of water they'll miss it now not one revelation is gonna fall short not one manifestations gonna be left void I'm not spilling one drop of this word I'm not stopping for nothing I don't care if they march against this by thousands we're not stopping I've got the Kings desire who you we've got the water which means we're packing the revival of the king I've got the Kings revival in me all the Pentecostals they thought they had a revival but the real revival when you want to come to the Pentecostals the real revival was gonna come through David's money man my agent towers him seven thunders was going to awaken the Gentile warriors to the real revival hallelujah what is the real revival it's the bride's revival it's the revival of fulfillment it's the revival her manifestation hey mana story Bible the King has been looking for it and longed for it's the revelation he's desired to make his desires down to a people how does he know how good this water is because he's drank it before and what he drank under the Alpha come on somehow he's designed for the manifestation under the Omega how can these men how convenes me and overcome when the odds is so great against them when it looks like men there's no way and Satan is bringing every gun that he has and he's pointing and holding against you how can we overcome because I'm know what the Kings desire they had a revelation within them that they was an invincible army I could read the quote to you but they was an invincible army they had a revelation that the king was coming into power and they was anointed with that desire so therefore they're anointed with the spirit of the King and they've seen David fight and if he overcome I can overcome he conquered I can conquer they're fighting don't you see that's why we've recognized this day that's the reason revelation is stuck in our hearts because we've seen our day we've seen our message and we've been anointed in this moment of time I believe this and we don't care how many enemy stands in the way we might as well give the devil fair warning nothing's gonna stop me from bringing my desire back to me we're under the ministry think about it we're under the ministry that the sword has been given amen church and the only reason I know you got a sword is because you're gonna have to do some fighting and when this message kind of underneath the third pull and revealed it to you and I let me tell you that message that went to get the rainbow trout it's because we're going to stand and fight all this of this I love this quote listen to the statements because because although Jesus swallowed a Bethlehem because although Jesus from Bethlehem is the bread of life he's also the water of life cooler to God their pack and Christ they're pack and Christ he's the water life sure he is and what did he do Oh God he was represented in both David and warriors really really think about it he's not just my presented in David that's Wang he's represented in every Gentile warrior who's packed in that water that revelation Christ back to the original place he's represented in both David and warders plural warriors because he was the king and he was the warrior who came and broke through the enemy's lines oh my but there's some men know that he was coming King Revelation chapter 4 but rim says they stayed right with him brother I mean you couldn't get them away from him as they walked on they were warriors and when he come into power you know what he done he made each one of them a ruler over a certain city don't you see Christ there he that overcomes shall rule over a city watch what he called us the overcomers and today when we see that he's coming in power Christ is going to rule in this world Germany United States he's gonna rule in Germany United States and all must fall every nation must fall the kings of this worlds become the kingdom of our God and of his Christ and he ruled in reign on them that's why we know by revelation we know he's coming in power so the least of his desire is a command to us and then bream screams this out and was our musicians come this morning well a little better him so rise your son's and warriors and let's cut back to our original Bethlehem remember when David come to song these men stood by him because they know David was going to be on the throne and brother brems said underneath that ecclesiastical system under that nickel alien spirit he said it went from a doctrine from a doctrine it's going to become a man and they're gonna crown their king but the Antichrist is gonna be crowned and he only copies what my God does brother Bram says we're gonna crayon here man we're gonna crown him king of all kings and Lord of all they understand our feet this morning god bless you oh he says and God's gifts always found their place he says how the Gentiles today men of honor me and raped me and taken the sword and standing there cutting her way through to get a fresh drink of water for Christ our David which is very unpopular today but our David which we know he's coming in power he's gonna every nation under feet like that and rule them with a rod of iron and real gallant me and standing with the Word of God chomping from one side to the side fearlessly because we know he's coming let's borrow hearts praise be to God we got a revelation he's coming but Evie you don't know the trials that we go through I'm telling you you're gonna have to fight but that's okay he's giving you something to fight with he's not left you in this hour helpless for you ain't got nothing to stand with he's giving you his word and you can stand with his word in this hour and they nothing sharper than his words they ain't no enemy to big day no problem to great if the Word of God can't pierce through every unbelief every doubt he can break through it he's coming into power the Kings desire I trust you've got that revelation today during the time of the harvest I've got a revelation that I'm gonna take and I'm gonna use this word I'm gonna use this message and allow it to transform me it's already turned me I'm not a sinner they transform me from a sinner to a saint that quickening power has already been at work in my life it's turned me from the world and turned me back heavenly set my feet in heavenly places it's already been at work transforming me now but it's an onus anointing us to stand anointing us to believe an Ordnung is too fat I trust if you make eyes the Lord give it to me tonight I wanted on me give me the strength that it takes to fight
