[38:57] [Music]
[39:07] stand
[39:11] how many knows he's given to you over
[39:13] and over and over again
[39:16] so much more than any of us
[39:19] ever deserve as far as deserving
[39:23] I'm glad that the Bible tells us that
[39:25] his mercies are renewed every morning
[39:32] and their privilege for us to be
[39:34] gathered together here tonight in the
[39:36] house of the Lord
[39:37] let's turn to First Corinthians chapter
[39:40] 12 if you would
[39:42] verse 14.
[39:48] First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 14.
[39:50] we'll read down through verses
[39:52] 18.
[39:54] for the body is not one member but many
[39:59] if the foot shall say because
[40:02] I am not the hand
[40:05] I am not of the body
[40:07] is it therefore
[40:09] not of the body
[40:11] and if the ear shall say because I am
[40:15] not the eye
[40:16] I am not of the body
[40:19] is it therefore
[40:21] not of the body
[40:23] if the whole body were an eye where were
[40:26] the hearing
[40:28] if the whole we're hearing
[40:30] where where the smelling
[40:34] but now God now listen how this all
[40:37] comes about God hath
[40:39] set
[40:43] God hath said
[40:45] we don't get to choose our position
[40:49] we don't get to choose our position in
[40:52] Christ
[40:53] and we don't actually get to choose our
[40:55] position when it comes to being in the
[40:57] local body
[40:58] now you've always gone
[41:00] people who want to do this and that and
[41:04] the other in the church
[41:06] and you've got some I find it such a
[41:09] Marvel
[41:10] because many times people who want to do
[41:13] this or that or the other
[41:15] they're not gifted at all to do it
[41:18] and some of the ones who are gifted you
[41:20] have to pump them you have to Prime them
[41:23] you have to pull them you have to coax
[41:26] them you nearly have to beg them
[41:29] and you think why didn't the Lord give
[41:31] that to the people who wanted to do it
[41:33] all the time
[41:36] generally brother Bram says the man who
[41:38] wants to do it is the man who's not
[41:40] called to do it
[41:43] oh what a way to start the sermon
[41:46] but you see God sets it in the body but
[41:50] now has God set the members every one of
[41:55] them
[41:56] so whether you're big or little you know
[41:58] however you categorize yourself
[42:01] really we shouldn't look down on that or
[42:04] we shouldn't look up to and think wow I
[42:06] am really something because God gave me
[42:08] this and this and what choice did you
[42:11] have
[42:12] no
[42:13] so if God gives us gifts
[42:16] what can any of us brag about
[42:19] since he's the one who gave them to us
[42:21] so if I was going to give away say a
[42:23] hundred thousand dollars tonight which
[42:25] is a joke right
[42:26] so I chose to give you a nickel you a
[42:29] dime you 15 cents you 20 25 30 dollar
[42:32] two dollars three dollars four dollars
[42:34] five whatever it was could the person
[42:36] who received forty fifty thousand
[42:38] dollars because they say boy and I
[42:40] something brother Donnie gave me forty
[42:42] thousand you know gave him a nickel
[42:47] what what could you brag about
[42:50] is it not from me
[42:54] so if one preacher would be able to
[42:56] reach thousands times thousands and
[42:59] thousands of people in his ministry when
[43:01] he's on the earth and affect people all
[43:04] over the world and God did that
[43:07] and then another man would be not very
[43:10] much renowned maybe a pastor of a little
[43:12] small church or maybe an evangelist that
[43:14] would preaching very very tiny small
[43:16] churches
[43:18] could the other guy which is more famous
[43:20] as we'd say have anything to brag about
[43:24] more so than the man that God give the
[43:27] smaller portion to no
[43:30] should that man give more glory in the
[43:32] eyes of people you shouldn't he does
[43:35] but he shouldn't
[43:36] because God is the one who gives them
[43:39] out
[43:41] is that right
[43:43] let's read it again but now God has set
[43:45] the members every one of them
[43:49] in the body notice the way he does it
[43:51] and the reason he does it as it has
[43:56] pleased him
[43:59] so if it pleases God to make you a
[44:04] little finger
[44:05] that's all you are
[44:08] now you may look at that and think why
[44:10] that thing ain't worth nothing well let
[44:12] me just give you a little preview of
[44:14] what I'm fixing to read to you in a
[44:15] minute your little finger
[44:19] attributes 50 percent
[44:23] of the strings
[44:25] of your hand
[44:30] your little finger
[44:33] how many of you knew that
[44:35] you mean the medical people didn't even
[44:37] know it brother they hadn't heard you
[44:38] didn't know that
[44:42] now would we have ever thought that
[44:44] 'll tell what you're trying to do you
[44:46] try to do something without it and
[44:48] you'll realize how weak the rest of
[44:51] these bigger fingers are
[44:56] the way God made it
[44:59] so if you're a little finger tonight we
[45:01] need you big time
[45:05] but you see you don't have to be the
[45:07] biggest around or the longest
[45:09] you just have to be where God puts you
[45:12] isn't that amazing that the smallest one
[45:15] on the hand would contribute 50 percent
[45:18] of the strength of the hand
[45:20] you mean more than these big guys
[45:23] well that's the way God does it in it I
[45:26] love him for it myself
[45:28] I mean a lot to be remembered tonight as
[45:30] we pray
[45:33] Heavenly Father we believe you have some
[45:35] wonderful things in store for us tonight
[45:38] I pray that our understanding would be
[45:41] an enlightened Lord that you would open
[45:44] our understanding
[45:46] help us to see and realize father that
[45:48] it's not us that places ourself
[45:52] it's not us that we can choose from a
[45:55] multiple choice that I would like to be
[45:58] this or be that or be the other
[46:00] but actually the prophet tells us we
[46:03] would save ourselves and you a lot of
[46:06] trouble
[46:07] if we would go to him who brought us
[46:11] on the Earth
[46:13] and say why am I here
[46:15] what am I here for
[46:17] I pray you'd help each of us tonight
[46:19] father that we would be able to do such
[46:24] that we would be able to give everything
[46:26] we are to the cause of almighty God
[46:31] and have confidence in you that placed
[46:34] us and set us in the body
[46:37] so size is irrelevant how many people we
[46:40] affect is irrelevant
[46:42] what's important is we fulfill our
[46:46] setting because that's all you require
[46:49] of us speak to us to not from your word
[46:52] father in the name of the Lord Jesus we
[46:55] pray amen God bless you Saints you may
[46:58] be seated
[47:01] now looking at the human body and the
[47:03] way that Paul
[47:05] dealt with it as we looked at it last
[47:07] week about the hands the eyes the ears
[47:09] the smelling the hearing all of that I
[47:12] went into a little bit more research and
[47:15] study looking at the human body I've
[47:19] always loved the way that David said it
[47:21] in Psalms 139 verse 14 and he said I
[47:26] will praise thee for I am fearfully and
[47:31] wonderfully made marvelous are thy works
[47:35] and that my soul knoweth right well
[47:40] now David would not have been aware of
[47:45] some of the things that I'm going to
[47:46] share with you tonight as far as
[47:48] physiology and the scientific part of
[47:51] the body he would not have known more
[47:53] than likely Paul didn't know it because
[47:55] medicine had not Advanced to the stage
[47:58] that it is today whenever Paul likened
[48:01] the different parts of the spiritual
[48:03] body to the eyes the ears the hands the
[48:06] feet but Paul could see that there was a
[48:08] great comparison from the natural body
[48:11] to the spiritual body now what I'd like
[48:14] to do tonight with the helpful Lord is
[48:16] to be able to give you a little bit of
[48:18] understanding in the way that God Made
[48:21] You and I want to help you see who and
[48:25] what you are just in your anatomy in the
[48:29] natural side and look and see at some of
[48:31] the Marvel and the Wonder in the way
[48:34] that God made you and then surely if we
[48:38] can look at that we would be able to see
[48:40] what a great spiritual comparison it
[48:43] would be to the spiritual body so again
[48:45] David said I will praise thee for I am
[48:48] fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous
[48:53] are thy works and that my soul knoweth
[48:58] right well well I'm sure you all agree
[49:00] with me that God Don't Make No jump does
[49:02] he so whether we are little or big fat
[49:05] or skinny whatever we are uh you know
[49:08] our race or whatever that that sort of
[49:10] thing that we are it really doesn't have
[49:13] any relevance in the state of God loving
[49:15] One race above the other or one skin
[49:17] color or one person because there are
[49:20] more you know more handsome than the
[49:22] other or or a lady that's more beautiful
[49:24] than the other but God places him in the
[49:27] body as it pleases him now I find it a
[49:31] Marvel in myself when I look at the
[49:34] mystery of the human body
[49:36] I want you to just listen to me
[49:38] carefully now put some of this up so you
[49:40] can follow me along based on an adult
[49:43] man's typical volume you might conclude
[49:47] that the human body contains 15 trillion
[49:54] cells
[49:56] 15 trillion cells now I Marvel at how
[50:00] many there are and then I got to
[50:02] thinking I wonder who counted all them
[50:04] to know how many was there
[50:07] now think that your body contains an
[50:10] average-sized man would be 15 trillion
[50:14] cells and yet God knows every one of
[50:18] them and God put the ability in those
[50:22] cells to do what they're supposed to do
[50:25] now the body is given great power in
[50:28] that it can heal itself my brother I'm
[50:31] taught us this as far as back as the
[50:33] early 50s that Life Is A Healer so
[50:37] healing is within you Satan found that
[50:40] out of course many many thousands of
[50:43] years ago so what he tries to do is
[50:46] affect the healing power that's in the
[50:49] body and even cause what we know today
[50:52] to be auto immune diseases and right now
[50:57] they've got right at a hundred that they
[51:00] have named a hundred
[51:02] autoimmune diseases and you know what
[51:05] that is of course it is sees to where
[51:08] the body will attack itself so the body
[51:13] from within the body the protective
[51:16] system it will begin to attack parts of
[51:19] the body because it looks at them and it
[51:23] thinks that it's a pathogen or it's
[51:26] something that's from the outside and
[51:29] the body is somehow tricked so the
[51:33] immune system begins to attack your own
[51:36] body I mean understands what that is now
[51:39] you realize that Satan tries to do the
[51:42] same thing in the spiritual body of
[51:45] Christ now this is why he always tries
[51:48] to use people in the body to bring
[51:52] attacks on people in the same body he
[51:56] will do the same thing inside the church
[51:58] he'll do the same thing inside a local
[52:00] assembly he'll do the same thing inside
[52:03] a move of God that we're all part of so
[52:06] he will send a spiritual
[52:10] autoimmune disease then I'm sure you
[52:13] know it but a Celiac disease that's
[52:16] exactly what it is diabetes is of the
[52:19] same type of thing many many many of
[52:21] them so it's an autoimmune disease so a
[52:26] person that would have a heart
[52:27] transplant a liver many different organs
[52:30] of the body they will have to put them
[52:32] on certain drugs and keep them on those
[52:35] drugs basically the rest of their life
[52:38] because the body will sense that that
[52:41] liver was not part of that body whenever
[52:44] it was conceived in the mother's womb so
[52:47] the body will attack that liver that the
[52:50] doctors transplanted to save your life
[52:53] so they have to put you on a drug to
[52:57] trick the body well you realize Satan
[53:00] found this out many many years ago that
[53:03] the spiritual body is made very much the
[53:06] same way
[53:07] so if each of us would find our place in
[53:10] the body and do what we're supposed to
[53:12] do then we would not render ourselves
[53:16] our minds our opinions our mouths our
[53:19] different views and so on uh to the
[53:22] devil to where the devil will be able to
[53:24] attack say our our church or in a family
[53:28] now you take a family they can be the
[53:31] same way that if that family will run
[53:33] together on the same motive same purpose
[53:37] same objective then Satan won't have
[53:39] anybody to work through but if he can
[53:42] get one member of that family and the
[53:45] prophet tells us in question answers
[53:46] 1964 if one member of that family gets
[53:50] nervous and tore up then the whole
[53:53] family gets tore up why because that one
[53:57] member gets tore up so then it's like an
[54:00] autoimmune disease and Satan will use
[54:03] that husband that wife that child
[54:06] whoever it is and they will begin to
[54:09] attack the rest of the entire body so
[54:12] it's the same way in a church it's the
[54:14] same way in our mood now there's
[54:16] brothers that have been around the
[54:18] message for years and years and they
[54:20] begin to get a superiority idea about
[54:24] themselves and they begin to think that
[54:27] they have some type of Revelation that
[54:29] is superior to most everybody else in
[54:32] the message so this is where all the
[54:35] major doctrines that have come and have
[54:37] divided the message people over the
[54:39] years it started with a man somewhere
[54:42] well let me rephrase that it started in
[54:44] hell and then the devil got a hold to
[54:46] some man on the earth that had an
[54:48] arrogance problem
[54:50] and then that autoimmune disease that
[54:53] spiritual disease now whether it started
[54:56] in England or in Germany or in New York
[54:59] or in Jeffersonville wherever it was it
[55:02] started with an individual and they
[55:04] began to listen to an evil spirit and
[55:07] they become affected themselves then if
[55:11] they were a preacher then most of them
[55:13] aren't then they would have to go in
[55:15] among their following and they would
[55:17] begin to attack the doctrines that
[55:20] they've been hearing for 25 30 years 40
[55:23] and they would begin to from within that
[55:26] local assembly begin to attack those
[55:29] doctrines and it would set up that
[55:31] autoimmune disease then of course it
[55:34] never stops with that church but it
[55:36] wants to spread so to go beyond that
[55:39] church to another to another to another
[55:41] before long it has swept the world in a
[55:45] matter of months now it's amazing how
[55:47] the internet is it's a great tool but
[55:49] Satan also learn how to use the internet
[55:52] himself so a man here in America can
[55:55] start out on a false Doctrine or an
[55:57] error and if he gains a certain
[55:59] following around the world years ago it
[56:02] would have taken that man months or
[56:04] years to be able to go from Zimbabwe to
[56:07] Zaire to South Africa to Tanzania to
[56:11] China to Korea but not anymore all he's
[56:14] got to do is have a certain following
[56:16] and then he begins to stream his his
[56:18] ideas and his ideology and he will
[56:21] become another autoimmune disease that
[56:24] will begin to spread all around the
[56:26] world globally in six months he's
[56:29] covered the entire Earth wow and what is
[56:32] it it is a disease that has attacked an
[56:36] individual and it wants to attain other
[56:39] individuals that are in the same mood
[56:42] you understand what I'm saying now
[56:44] that's what happens inside of our body
[56:46] so what is it that tricks a person that
[56:50] is a Celiac so something within their
[56:53] body it begins to attack them now it's
[56:56] amazing because they don't always
[56:57] understand exactly how it starts because
[56:59] some of them aren't always born that way
[57:01] but it's not they begin to develop this
[57:04] certain thing so one day something
[57:06] inside the body begins to trigger so
[57:09] this person that is has eaten wheat and
[57:11] they've ate this and that and the other
[57:13] for months or years and all of a sudden
[57:15] it makes them sick and they start
[57:17] breaking out on a rash or a hive and
[57:20] whatever the symptoms begin to be and
[57:22] they get to where that if they eat this
[57:24] it can almost kill them and then they go
[57:27] to a doctor and they say I don't know
[57:28] what's wrong I don't know what's wrong
[57:30] doctor well what's happened what have
[57:31] you been eating what's this or that or
[57:33] the other and then they track it to
[57:35] trace it down and they say well you know
[57:37] it's a Celia it's this set if you always
[57:40] been the swing no no I've always eat
[57:42] this and drink that it's never bothered
[57:45] me what was it something in the body
[57:48] began to change change and when it does
[57:52] then it begins to attack what was normal
[57:56] for years and years can't you see the
[57:59] way Satan does now he tries to do
[58:01] marriages the same way an autoimmune
[58:04] disease come between the man and his
[58:07] wife and they've been happy for years
[58:09] and years and all of a sudden something
[58:12] will come between them and they're
[58:13] getting attacked on every hand if they
[58:16] don't put a stop to it it'll destroy
[58:18] their marriage it's the same way in a
[58:21] family an autoimmune disease will begin
[58:23] to attack them and it used to be a
[58:26] peaceful happy family they seem like
[58:28] this all on the same page they have the
[58:30] same motive same objectives how many
[58:32] times have we seen it in families and
[58:35] also churches is that right so what is
[58:38] it then it's an autoimmune disease
[58:40] spiritual that will begin to attack
[58:42] somebody in the church and they go to
[58:45] run into the church with an idea or an
[58:47] opinion or a Doctrine or whatever it is
[58:49] and and Satan will try to get on this
[58:52] one and that one and the other one and
[58:54] people that they've loved and fellowship
[58:56] for years and years they get to where
[58:58] they won't even speak to it they won't
[59:00] have nothing to do with them anymore
[59:02] well that's the same thing that happens
[59:04] in a person's body when an autoimmune
[59:07] disease will begin to attack them now
[59:10] notice how marvelous that we are made
[59:13] and how wonderfully that we are made so
[59:17] watch this in the human body would
[59:19] contain around 15 trillion cells now if
[59:23] all those cells will stay what they're
[59:25] supposed to be then they will fight now
[59:28] God divided of course the blood to
[59:30] whether there would be white blood cells
[59:32] red blood cells and we know that the
[59:34] whiter the ones are the soldiers they
[59:36] give their life for us to be able to try
[59:38] to hone in on a disease or a pathogen
[59:41] that enters inside of our body and they
[59:43] fight and they give their life to keep
[59:46] you from dying well I believe that
[59:48] there's white blood cells as we would
[59:50] say in the body of God and they watch
[59:53] over us and they're the men of God that
[59:55] God is called to try to watch over the
[59:57] flock of God and yet there's also others
[1:00:00] and they identify themselves as white
[1:00:03] but it's perfectly clear that they're
[1:00:05] not they're actually a pathogen which
[1:00:08] identifies themselves as a white blood
[1:00:11] cell and many times the people they
[1:00:14] trick the people into believing that
[1:00:16] they are a white blood cell when in
[1:00:19] reality they are a pathogen now the
[1:00:22] prophet tells us that all diseases are
[1:00:25] fourth dimension diseases now I know
[1:00:27] cancer and all the rest of these
[1:00:29] diseases do not begin in time now they
[1:00:32] can look at it with a microscope and
[1:00:34] they can say well it's of this family
[1:00:36] and this and that and the other but they
[1:00:38] do not have a microscope that will be
[1:00:40] able to open up the fourth dimension
[1:00:42] which is where they start so a demon
[1:00:44] comes out of the fourth dimension and it
[1:00:46] will get into a cell which is backslin
[1:00:51] backslid now it tells us this of course
[1:00:53] in demonology 1953 also 1955 also 1960s
[1:00:58] several different places so a cell that
[1:01:01] is vaccin now it becomes bruised as we
[1:01:04] would say then so this this Spirit gets
[1:01:07] inside this cell now the spirit cannot
[1:01:10] multiply human cells it cannot create
[1:01:13] human cells so it has to find a
[1:01:16] backslidden human self same way in a
[1:01:19] family same way in a church so then this
[1:01:22] demon will take this human cell that is
[1:01:25] back sitting bruised wounded whatever
[1:01:27] you want to call it and then that cell
[1:01:30] will submit itself over under the
[1:01:33] influence of this pathogen or this demon
[1:01:36] Spirit now this demon Spirit then will
[1:01:38] take that and cells have the ability
[1:01:41] within themselves to be able to divide
[1:01:45] themselves you understand that they have
[1:01:47] the ability that's the way you started
[1:01:49] in your mother's womb so that cell has
[1:01:51] the ability that demon can't do that you
[1:01:54] see there's no more demons today than
[1:01:57] there was when they fell in the
[1:01:59] beginning they started out as angels of
[1:02:01] course and they fell how many ever that
[1:02:04] they are that their words in there's no
[1:02:06] more tonight Satan has the exact same
[1:02:09] number so they cannot divide themselves
[1:02:12] and multiply and then divide again and
[1:02:14] multiply but Satan had to break him to
[1:02:17] the realm of the fourth dimension to
[1:02:19] break into the body and then get a cell
[1:02:22] that's backslid and then that cell can
[1:02:25] divide itself now those of you who don't
[1:02:28] understand cancer you know that cancer
[1:02:30] cells are different than other cells in
[1:02:32] our body our cells have a built-in
[1:02:35] mechanism created by God to whether they
[1:02:38] have an on and off switch toward that
[1:02:40] they will shut off cancer cells don't
[1:02:42] have that cancer cells just keep on and
[1:02:45] keep on and keep on and keep on they
[1:02:48] don't have they often on switch and this
[1:02:51] is why that they will overpower a human
[1:02:55] body but I'm glad tonight our father has
[1:02:58] an off and on switch for cancer cells
[1:03:02] now watch what will happen then in the
[1:03:04] same way spiritually whenever a spirit a
[1:03:07] spiritual pathogen will try to get into
[1:03:10] a marriage or a spiritual pathogen or
[1:03:13] try to get into a family or a church or
[1:03:15] a move of God then they will start
[1:03:17] multiplying and this one will have false
[1:03:20] Doctrine then they don't want to keep it
[1:03:22] to their self what do they want to do
[1:03:23] they want to share it with someone else
[1:03:25] and then someone else and someone else
[1:03:27] you see what they're doing they're
[1:03:29] fought on the exact same pattern that
[1:03:32] demons do from the fourth dimension into
[1:03:35] a human body oh my goodness I hope
[1:03:37] somebody's hearing me tonight so God
[1:03:40] made the human body in such a wonderful
[1:03:42] way to where that it would be able to
[1:03:44] reproduce itself God made us in such a
[1:03:47] place in such a way that actually our
[1:03:50] skeletal system is totally renewed in 10
[1:03:55] years
[1:03:57] you don't have the same vertebrae that
[1:03:59] you have when you were born your
[1:04:01] skeletal system is totally renewed in 10
[1:04:05] years your your outside layer of your
[1:04:08] skin it ain't the same one that you've
[1:04:10] had since last year it totally renews
[1:04:13] itself and changes can't you see the the
[1:04:17] remnants of eternal life are actually in
[1:04:21] our body now if we knew what to look for
[1:04:24] you see what will happen in eternity is
[1:04:27] we will go back to eating vegetation we
[1:04:31] will not eat cattle we will not there'll
[1:04:33] be no meat eaters there there'll be
[1:04:35] nothing that will die in the Garden of
[1:04:37] Eden Adam and Eve would have plucked the
[1:04:40] fruit off of the trees and it was not
[1:04:42] giving their life of course and they was
[1:04:44] constantly knew it whenever we go into
[1:04:46] the paradise of God we will go back to a
[1:04:49] body which will constantly renew itself
[1:04:52] and the prophet said it this way that
[1:04:54] those people living inside that City and
[1:04:57] they're eating from the leaves and the
[1:04:59] fruit off of that tree they are
[1:05:02] constantly renewing their use they are
[1:05:06] renewing their use it's in you and I
[1:05:09] tonight already to do that
[1:05:13] oh my goodness yeah y'all y'all still
[1:05:15] want to go with me tonight on this
[1:05:16] journey all right now watch this look at
[1:05:18] look at something else here messages
[1:05:20] from the human brain travel along nerves
[1:05:25] in our body nerves at up to 200 miles an
[1:05:30] hour
[1:05:31] so messages from our brain move along
[1:05:35] the nerves now it's amazing how that God
[1:05:39] when he chose the electrical part of our
[1:05:42] body and of course we have electrical
[1:05:44] part in our heart and we have electrical
[1:05:46] part in our brain and the electrical
[1:05:48] part is what conveys the messages back
[1:05:50] and forth so the the message for your
[1:05:53] finger to move it's not dropped in the
[1:05:55] bloodstream so it's not dropped in the
[1:05:58] endocrine stream or the lip stream but
[1:06:02] it's dropped on the neurological side of
[1:06:05] your body so God chose the neurological
[1:06:08] side and the brain is all all hooked up
[1:06:11] to all the nerves going through your
[1:06:13] body and then whenever you will think of
[1:06:16] salt it travels at up to 200 miles an
[1:06:20] hour to be able to go from your brain to
[1:06:22] your little finger or your little toe
[1:06:24] whatever it is there are more bacteria
[1:06:28] in a human Mouse than there are people
[1:06:31] in the world
[1:06:34] somebody passed the Listerine
[1:06:38] wow can you imagine that more bacteria
[1:06:42] in your mouth than there are people in
[1:06:46] the world
[1:06:47] a human's little finger contributes over
[1:06:51] 50 percent of the hands strengths
[1:06:56] a human's little finger contributes over
[1:07:00] 50 percent of the hamstring I'll tell
[1:07:04] you what if I stopped right now and we
[1:07:06] dismiss we ought to be able to walk out
[1:07:08] of this place tonight and say it was
[1:07:11] good to be in church because you may
[1:07:13] think you ain't nothing but a little
[1:07:15] finger this or that or the other don't
[1:07:17] you look at that and say well I'm of no
[1:07:19] value I hope that you never look at
[1:07:22] yourself again the same way I'm not
[1:07:25] talking about now in a form of arrogant
[1:07:27] surprise and remember it is him who
[1:07:31] placed us to be what we are in the body
[1:07:34] if a human being's DNA were uncoiled now
[1:07:39] listen to this it would stretch 10
[1:07:43] billion miles
[1:07:45] now every one of you sitting here
[1:07:47] tonight if your DNA was uncoiled it
[1:07:51] would reach 10 billion miles from the
[1:07:55] Earth to Pluto and back that's just in
[1:07:59] your DNA now you've seen the pictures of
[1:08:01] the DNA right the way it goes around the
[1:08:03] ladder and all that sort of thing so it
[1:08:05] would stretch 10 billion miles from
[1:08:08] Earth to Pluto and back all my you mean
[1:08:12] our god did all of this and you know to
[1:08:15] me it takes more faith to believe that
[1:08:19] we jumped out of some green pond way
[1:08:22] back under somewhere some frog or
[1:08:25] something or we come from a bunch of
[1:08:27] monkeys than it did that the Lord God
[1:08:29] made man in the Garden of Eden oh it
[1:08:33] makes to me it's a lot farther out how
[1:08:34] in the world could you and I ever come
[1:08:37] from some pollywog or wallypog or
[1:08:40] whatever they want to say we were and
[1:08:43] all of these intricate systems that are
[1:08:46] in our body and every one of them work
[1:08:49] exactly the way they did there ain't no
[1:08:52] way or brother Donnie it was Darwin's
[1:08:55] theory it was Darwin's baloney Darwin
[1:08:58] Siri ain't got no truth to it the truth
[1:09:01] of it is in the beginning God created
[1:09:04] the heavens and the Earth and it was God
[1:09:07] that made man in his own image
[1:09:12] oh my notice this for an adult human
[1:09:17] taking just one step
[1:09:20] uses up to 200 muscles
[1:09:26] now look at all that you have done for
[1:09:28] your entire life
[1:09:30] and you wasn't even aware that you were
[1:09:33] doing it
[1:09:35] so tell me how have we walked all these
[1:09:38] years and we didn't even know it was
[1:09:41] taking about 200 muscles to do it
[1:09:44] you see it was committed to us so if
[1:09:48] there's so much about ourselves humanly
[1:09:50] that we don't understand and don't know
[1:09:53] I wonder how much more spiritually there
[1:09:56] is about us Oh Glory I hope the Lord
[1:10:00] will open our understanding tonight and
[1:10:02] help us to see there's a great parallel
[1:10:04] okay now can you imagine how complex it
[1:10:08] would be for us to try to figure out
[1:10:11] which 200 am I using now or which you
[1:10:15] know what you'll wind up doing falling
[1:10:17] flat on your face
[1:10:18] but you know what God did God committed
[1:10:21] much of what we do and the way we move
[1:10:24] and the way we live and the way that we
[1:10:27] exist to what element our subconscience
[1:10:30] you note as well as I do that if you're
[1:10:33] familiar with a certain set of steps you
[1:10:34] can go up and down them steps never even
[1:10:37] think about it is that right but you
[1:10:39] ever notice that you will stumble or
[1:10:41] trip when you go to thinking about them
[1:10:44] steps and you watch yourself why you're
[1:10:46] pulling that from the subconscious
[1:10:49] running it through the conscience and
[1:10:51] the conscience and the subconscience are
[1:10:54] clashing one with the other if you'll
[1:10:56] let the subconscious how how do you
[1:10:58] figure you Breeze at night when you're
[1:10:59] asleep how do you figure your heart
[1:11:02] pumps at night when you're asleep how is
[1:11:04] it that you figure when you need to go
[1:11:06] to the bathroom and you're sound asleep
[1:11:08] as I don't know what and all of a sudden
[1:11:10] you'll wake up well it's that other
[1:11:11] party about the part of your body said
[1:11:13] hey you go to the bathroom come back go
[1:11:15] to sleep how is it that your heart goes
[1:11:17] it's that subconscious so God committed
[1:11:20] much of it it's the same way with our
[1:11:23] faith walk that God commits much of our
[1:11:27] walk into the subconscious level which
[1:11:29] the prophet said was Faith he said the
[1:11:32] Lord Jesus was unconscious of the face
[1:11:36] that he was and he said he didn't think
[1:11:38] well I've got to go see if I've got
[1:11:40] enough Faith to do this and he said a
[1:11:42] real believer that walks in that realm
[1:11:45] of Faith you're totally unconscious to
[1:11:48] that Faith itself oh I'm trying to have
[1:11:50] faith in trying to have faith you're
[1:11:52] pulling it away from the subconscious
[1:11:54] and trying to pull it up here in your
[1:11:56] head but if you leave it into the man in
[1:11:59] the engine room he he will believe from
[1:12:02] this man here still trying to figure it
[1:12:04] out
[1:12:05] you don't have to think about how your
[1:12:07] heart's going to do this and that and
[1:12:09] the other how is it in the four cycles
[1:12:11] of sleep that you come into the first
[1:12:13] stage into the second stage you don't
[1:12:14] even really need that much in the third
[1:12:16] and fourth stage with an hour or so too
[1:12:18] maybe and you go into that deep cycle of
[1:12:21] sleep and you can wake up because you're
[1:12:22] only there so long but you'll be there
[1:12:24] long enough to where you get that deep
[1:12:26] sleep that you need and you're able to
[1:12:28] wake up and feel as refreshed as you can
[1:12:30] be because you're in that cycle you
[1:12:33] don't even know you're doing that you
[1:12:35] don't even know that your heart rate's
[1:12:36] on down your blood pressure's on down
[1:12:38] this is why they say if you wake up two
[1:12:40] or three o'clock in the morning it's
[1:12:42] because your body temperature is
[1:12:43] changing and your body kind of Shivers a
[1:12:45] little bit and then it'll bring you from
[1:12:47] that unconscious state to the conscience
[1:12:49] State and then the body will set the
[1:12:51] well now you're Wide Awake the worst
[1:12:53] thing you can do is look at that clock
[1:12:54] sitting on your nightstand so they say
[1:12:56] so you accept on your look at it you
[1:12:58] look at it and you look at it but the
[1:13:00] best thing you can do is start
[1:13:02] controlling your breathing and slow down
[1:13:04] your breathing because you you cannot go
[1:13:06] back to sleep totally impossible through
[1:13:08] your breathing as long as you're fast
[1:13:10] breathing and you're nervous and you're
[1:13:12] anxious and you're watching the clock oh
[1:13:14] I got to get up in an hour and a half
[1:13:15] I've got to get up in two hours anybody
[1:13:17] ever done that beside me on your
[1:13:18] watching that car watching that worst
[1:13:21] thing you can do but begin to
[1:13:23] concentrate Slow Down slow your
[1:13:25] breathing why the first conscience is
[1:13:27] taking it away from your subconscious
[1:13:29] and your first conscience is nervous and
[1:13:32] the subconscious if you don't lay down
[1:13:34] I'm gonna smack you let me have this
[1:13:36] breathing let me have that I'll put you
[1:13:38] back to sleep if you'll let me but you
[1:13:41] won't let him will you you're so anxious
[1:13:43] you're so nervous and that's why Satan
[1:13:45] wants to make us afraid with doctors
[1:13:48] reports and the scans of this and that
[1:13:51] and the other and we go to thinking and
[1:13:53] fearing oh no oh no oh no what am I
[1:13:55] going to do let your unconscious face
[1:13:58] have it and it will handle it and bring
[1:14:01] your Miracle but if we keep holding on
[1:14:04] oh how will it be what when will it be I
[1:14:06] don't know I don't know oh my goodness
[1:14:08] I'm getting worse I'm getting worse but
[1:14:10] let Faith have it faith will look at it
[1:14:12] and say it don't make no difference if I
[1:14:14] get so bad or die if God if it ain't
[1:14:17] God's will for me to die he'll raise me
[1:14:19] back up again that's what faith will do
[1:14:23] oh
[1:14:25] oh thank you Lord a human skeleton
[1:14:30] renews itself completely
[1:14:34] every 10 years
[1:14:38] look at what you're doing as you're
[1:14:39] sitting here tonight you are renewing
[1:14:42] yourself
[1:14:46] the body can detect taste
[1:14:49] in point zero zero one five seconds
[1:14:57] which is faster than the blink of an eye
[1:15:02] isn't it amazing wouldn't it be bad I
[1:15:05] mean you're just eating eating eating it
[1:15:07] took about 15 minutes for the taste
[1:15:08] hitch and you go oh
[1:15:11] is it amazing how quick who was it that
[1:15:15] did that
[1:15:16] who was it they gave you that almighty
[1:15:18] God what you know what I see when I look
[1:15:20] at this I think if God did that for the
[1:15:22] natural body hasn't God provided for the
[1:15:26] spiritual body of Christ as well that if
[1:15:28] we would just listen and we would follow
[1:15:31] the Divine protocol of God how much
[1:15:33] stuff that we'll be able to spare
[1:15:35] ourselves but it's when we break out of
[1:15:38] the continuity of the head of the head
[1:15:41] that God places this is why Satan wants
[1:15:44] to pull us away from the word because
[1:15:46] the word ought to be our headship every
[1:15:49] move we make the things we do the way we
[1:15:52] live whatever we do we ought to run it
[1:15:55] right through the word of God if we did
[1:15:57] we'd eliminate a lot of problems
[1:16:01] oh my
[1:16:03] god listen about your brain
[1:16:06] the brain contains 86 billion nerve
[1:16:11] cells joined by a hundred trillion
[1:16:16] connections
[1:16:20] 86 billion nerve cells joined by a
[1:16:25] hundred trillion connections
[1:16:28] that is more than the numbers of stars
[1:16:31] in the Milky Way
[1:16:34] in your brain
[1:16:37] and who was it that wired all that up
[1:16:40] who was it that put all of them billions
[1:16:44] of nerve cells in your brain and made
[1:16:47] all them connections
[1:16:49] almighty God
[1:16:51] what if the devil gets in there and goes
[1:16:53] to twists in one of them and trying to
[1:16:55] contort it and twist it around and try
[1:16:57] to make you sick can't the one who made
[1:17:00] them in the beginning go back in there
[1:17:02] and rewire it and straighten it out
[1:17:04] it's amazing to me when brother Brandon
[1:17:07] would pray for people many times that
[1:17:08] was blind and he would rebuke
[1:17:12] that demon that had a hold of that
[1:17:15] optical nerve
[1:17:18] and in one place
[1:17:21] he called it by name
[1:17:24] Optimus
[1:17:27] Optimus
[1:17:30] you Optimus
[1:17:33] I imagine that devil got his hide scared
[1:17:36] off
[1:17:38] you'll imagine being able to peer into
[1:17:41] that Realm of the fourth dimension and
[1:17:44] either hear or see that Demon's name
[1:17:47] which we're not even sure if it was ever
[1:17:49] even called before in the open from Adam
[1:17:52] on down
[1:17:54] oh my
[1:17:56] God so the devil will try to affect one
[1:18:00] or a hundred billion or 50 or whatever
[1:18:03] it is of these cells but cannot the
[1:18:06] Creator which made them fix them
[1:18:09] so a a cancer what's the the blood block
[1:18:13] that comes up through your neck the way
[1:18:15] that the doctors describe it there's a
[1:18:18] blood block by which it's supposed to
[1:18:20] filter most of these bad things from
[1:18:23] coming into your body
[1:18:25] and this is one reason why they never
[1:18:27] hadn't done a head scan or brain scan on
[1:18:30] Eric of nine months or so
[1:18:33] because a neural endocrine that she's
[1:18:35] dealing with very rare did they ever go
[1:18:38] to the Head maybe half a dozen
[1:18:41] people
[1:18:43] in decades
[1:18:44] something never even done one
[1:18:47] and this is why whenever she started
[1:18:50] talking out of her head a bit ago that
[1:18:52] they'd done one and that's just one they
[1:18:54] found those places in the head and the
[1:18:56] doctor said that this is so unusual
[1:18:59] it should not pass through the brain the
[1:19:01] blood block that comes up that goes into
[1:19:03] the head
[1:19:04] but he said that cell is so small that
[1:19:08] it's smaller than a blood cell
[1:19:10] and it was able to go through there
[1:19:13] and pass through the blood block
[1:19:17] the way I look at it if it was small
[1:19:19] enough to get in there the Holy Ghost
[1:19:21] can get in there and root him out
[1:19:24] praise the Lord
[1:19:26] if the spirit of God made these bodies
[1:19:28] cannot he get in there and fix
[1:19:30] everything in there that's wrong
[1:19:32] can he do it thanks
[1:19:36] now notice God and what a great thing an
[1:19:39] adult human body is made up of about
[1:19:43] seven octillion
[1:19:46] Adams
[1:19:49] seven octillion
[1:19:53] wow
[1:19:55] in an adult human blood circulates 12
[1:20:00] 000 miles a day
[1:20:04] what a journey
[1:20:06] so your blood's done travel about 11 500
[1:20:10] by the time I get done it'll probably be
[1:20:11] fulfilled its cycle 12 000 miles your
[1:20:14] blood brother I serve your body 12 000
[1:20:17] miles a day
[1:20:21] praise God
[1:20:22] you were fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:20:29] wonder why
[1:20:31] gonna to move that fast it's on a
[1:20:34] journey it's carrying oxygen it's
[1:20:37] carrying nutrients it's carrying waste
[1:20:40] it's got all this going on so if Satan
[1:20:43] can slow it down in the body and the
[1:20:47] blood flow slows down what happens to us
[1:20:50] what happens to you if you sat on your
[1:20:52] leg or whatever it is and it goes numb
[1:20:54] as we say him he's ever done that or
[1:20:56] your foot go to sleep or you're like
[1:20:57] well you cut off the circulation you
[1:20:59] ever sleep on your side or however you
[1:21:01] sleep sometimes and you wake up and a
[1:21:03] hand on to sleep or an arm going to
[1:21:05] sleep as we say something has cut all or
[1:21:07] at least hindered the blood flow and
[1:21:10] that's the way Satan loves to do inside
[1:21:12] the spiritual body of Christ he wants to
[1:21:15] slow down the blood of Jesus Christ flow
[1:21:18] so if he can slow down the blood flow
[1:21:21] and slow down the flow of the life and
[1:21:24] the nutrients of the spirit of God then
[1:21:27] what do we do we go numb setting in a
[1:21:30] pew
[1:21:31] we ain't got no feeling no more we ain't
[1:21:34] got no emotion no more why the blood
[1:21:37] supply slowly come on somebody the blood
[1:21:41] supply is slowing down this is why we
[1:21:43] need to keep that blood afraid why it
[1:21:45] keeps feeling in your hands it keeps
[1:21:48] feeling in your lips it keeps feeling in
[1:21:51] your feet to where they don't go to
[1:21:52] sleep hey we're not sleeping virgins we
[1:21:56] want to be wise virgins that are
[1:21:58] worshiping and praising and loving and
[1:22:01] blessing the name of our Lord we want
[1:22:04] blood flowing through our soul we want
[1:22:07] blood flowing through our church
[1:22:10] [Applause]
[1:22:12] all praise the Lord
[1:22:15] and an adult human blood circulates
[1:22:18] about 12 000 miles a day this is like
[1:22:22] traveling from east to west across the
[1:22:26] widest part
[1:22:27] of the Pacific Ocean
[1:22:30] now can you imagine twelve thousand
[1:22:33] miles
[1:22:34] Carol and I several years ago flew on
[1:22:36] the third longest flight in the world
[1:22:40] the third longest flight
[1:22:42] was on the 747.
[1:22:45] I had some brothers share with us just
[1:22:47] yesterday visiting the church from South
[1:22:50] Africa and that was talking about how
[1:22:52] terrible the flight was how awful that
[1:22:54] it was and how long it was same flight
[1:22:57] that I had one airplane 19 and a half
[1:23:00] hours
[1:23:02] you're not stopping every little city
[1:23:03] between here and there that's Non-Stop
[1:23:07] 19 and a half hours
[1:23:10] and yet your blood
[1:23:13] travels more in one day than that jet
[1:23:17] plane does
[1:23:19] isn't it amazing and I I think about it
[1:23:21] myself and I know you'll think I'm weird
[1:23:23] anyway and you're gonna think I'm even
[1:23:24] more weird but I want you to think about
[1:23:26] you've got this pump inside of your body
[1:23:28] and it's pump pump pump you got blood
[1:23:32] running through all these vessels and
[1:23:34] all these veins inside of your body
[1:23:36] wouldn't it be so aggravating and so
[1:23:39] annoying if you heard that punk going
[1:23:41] all the time and that blood going
[1:23:47] it'd be so annoying but think here it is
[1:23:51] this close to you how come I don't hear
[1:23:53] it all the time
[1:23:54] how come that I don't hear the the
[1:23:56] karate already going up here in our
[1:23:58] veins of going the biggest ones in your
[1:23:59] body and yet why don't I hear all that
[1:24:01] going through all the time and it's so
[1:24:03] close to me he made it to where all this
[1:24:06] is going on inside of our body and yet
[1:24:09] maybe it's so comfortable and quiet
[1:24:12] [Laughter]
[1:24:14] oh praise the Lord but God couldn't make
[1:24:18] a human being who
[1:24:21] could make such a marvelous thing well
[1:24:24] let me bring it on down who but God
[1:24:26] could make this great and called The
[1:24:29] Bride of Jesus Christ man has tried to
[1:24:32] make him man has tried to make copies of
[1:24:35] him but there's only one creator that
[1:24:38] could be able to make a mystical move
[1:24:40] called The Bride of Jesus Christ there
[1:24:43] has never been anything like it and
[1:24:46] there will never be anything like it it
[1:24:48] is God's special creation
[1:24:54] praise God
[1:24:58] a human eye
[1:25:00] can distinguish between approximately
[1:25:04] 10 million
[1:25:07] different colors
[1:25:12] now think of the spiritual body
[1:25:15] so we have people in the church that can
[1:25:18] do this and others that can do that
[1:25:20] others that can do that what if it's all
[1:25:22] one heart what if it's all just one big
[1:25:24] ear one big eye and yet each one of them
[1:25:26] are so excellent in the purpose that God
[1:25:30] placed them for
[1:25:32] listen to this a person takes about 23
[1:25:36] 000 and 40 breaths
[1:25:40] a day
[1:25:42] on about
[1:25:44] 672 million 768
[1:25:49] 000 breaths
[1:25:51] in a lifetime
[1:25:55] praise the Lord
[1:25:57] how in the world is it
[1:26:00] these lungs can breathe that many times
[1:26:02] in one day
[1:26:05] how is it that I could breathe that many
[1:26:07] breaths in a lifetime they say in my
[1:26:12] lungs say Donnie would you please quit I
[1:26:14] need a break
[1:26:15] any y'all ever had your lungs to take a
[1:26:17] week off
[1:26:21] isn't it amazing they've been doing all
[1:26:23] this function for all these years how
[1:26:25] many hundreds of thousands of thousands
[1:26:28] and millions for those of you that are
[1:26:30] up in your 50s and your 60s and your 70s
[1:26:32] how many millions of times have they
[1:26:35] inhaled exhale inhale exhale inhale
[1:26:39] exhale and not one day off don't even
[1:26:42] take a Sabbath they don't even take a
[1:26:45] rest but they're constantly there for
[1:26:48] you but do you appreciate them most of
[1:26:51] us don't do we say lungs thank you so
[1:26:54] much for being so faithful you see if
[1:26:57] we're not careful that's the way it is
[1:26:59] in the body of Christ we tend to give
[1:27:02] praise to those that are so visible the
[1:27:05] part about us what are most of us known
[1:27:08] by our lungs
[1:27:10] are most of you known by your liver are
[1:27:13] most of you known by your kidneys how do
[1:27:16] most of us know you your face
[1:27:19] your face and your face oh my is what
[1:27:23] gets the recognition your face is what
[1:27:26] we identify you with is this right that
[1:27:30] yeah you take away all those hidden
[1:27:32] parts that's in behind the face and what
[1:27:35] have you got a lifeless face oh my I
[1:27:39] pray that ever long in here tonight
[1:27:41] every kidney ever blight or ever little
[1:27:44] toe or whatever you are we'll walk out
[1:27:47] of here tonight and say praise God there
[1:27:50] ain't nobody can take my place if I am a
[1:27:54] part of this assembly I am just as
[1:27:57] important as the face is
[1:28:00] amen
[1:28:05] notices you get a new top layer
[1:28:10] of skin
[1:28:12] epidermis
[1:28:14] every 30 days
[1:28:17] you're faster than a snake
[1:28:22] you just saw snakes shed their own skin
[1:28:25] oh maybe it's that old serpent
[1:28:27] connection we've got I don't know I'm
[1:28:28] just saying
[1:28:31] look for this is going on in us every
[1:28:34] day
[1:28:37] every day these great things wonderful
[1:28:40] things are happening where here
[1:28:44] look around us in our assembly in our
[1:28:47] move and our message wonderful sayings
[1:28:50] are happening every day every day every
[1:28:55] week every month wonderful things are
[1:28:58] happening and we're looking for what oh
[1:29:00] I'm waiting for a big move of God what
[1:29:03] come on
[1:29:09] now let's go inside the systems y'all
[1:29:12] y'all okay
[1:29:14] y'all to know you're just coming to
[1:29:15] medical school tonight did you
[1:29:18] let's look at the systems now in the
[1:29:20] human body
[1:29:22] the circulatory system
[1:29:24] and the cardiovascular now for those of
[1:29:26] you who are medical people
[1:29:28] forgive me if I butcher these words
[1:29:35] the circulatory system or the
[1:29:37] cardiovascular circulates blood around
[1:29:39] the body via the heart arteries and
[1:29:42] veins delivering oxygen and nutrients to
[1:29:46] organs and cells carrying on their waste
[1:29:49] products away
[1:29:51] as well as keeping the body's
[1:29:54] temperature in a safe range your body
[1:29:57] contains about 60
[1:30:01] 000 miles
[1:30:04] of blood vessels
[1:30:09] now see I've described Parts about you
[1:30:11] tonight that the most of you didn't even
[1:30:14] know
[1:30:16] right
[1:30:18] so it took somebody that knew not me
[1:30:21] medical people that knew I just simply
[1:30:25] Dr Googled it
[1:30:28] and then by them understanding and
[1:30:31] somebody else studying their
[1:30:33] understanding I was able to bring
[1:30:36] something to open your understanding of
[1:30:39] how fearfully and wonderfully you are
[1:30:41] made
[1:30:45] the digestive system
[1:30:47] and that's a story system
[1:30:50] the system to absorb nutrients and
[1:30:54] remove waste via the gastrointestinal
[1:30:57] tract including the mouse esophagus
[1:31:00] stomach and intestines now look at the
[1:31:04] systems that are going on inside of you
[1:31:07] tonight now more likely most of you ate
[1:31:09] supper four or five whatever time it was
[1:31:13] while you're sitting here these systems
[1:31:15] are going on inside of your body
[1:31:18] well you see this is why Satan wants to
[1:31:21] take away part of the vital systems that
[1:31:25] the church needs
[1:31:27] and the demon out of hell
[1:31:30] that gets on many message people trying
[1:31:33] to tell them they don't need a pasture
[1:31:37] well come on preach brother Downing or
[1:31:40] it'll get on them tell them well you
[1:31:42] don't need an evangelist all you need to
[1:31:43] do is just listen to tape or all you
[1:31:46] need to do is listen to brother Donnie
[1:31:48] because he's the only one that's the
[1:31:49] same it says it's the same line Devil
[1:31:51] with a different lie they're trying to
[1:31:53] tell other people all they need to do
[1:31:55] listen to a tape of brother Brown God
[1:31:57] never put one Pastor in the message he
[1:31:59] put a whole bunch of them God put
[1:32:01] evangelist God put teachers it's God
[1:32:04] that did that not you and I we do not
[1:32:07] vote them in in that sense of God placed
[1:32:10] them there himself God is the one who
[1:32:13] put him there and if you strip out one
[1:32:15] of these systems that we're going to
[1:32:17] talk about tonight in your body you will
[1:32:20] die it's the same way God has got a
[1:32:24] five-fold system inside the body of
[1:32:27] Jesus Christ come on somebody say amen
[1:32:30] and it's not tape tape tape tape tape
[1:32:33] it's pastors evangelists teachers
[1:32:36] prophets amen why because God placed
[1:32:40] them in the body as a system that would
[1:32:43] work the body we will never be a whale
[1:32:47] body come on somebody we will never go
[1:32:50] into a Rapture trying to deny four out
[1:32:54] of the five we've got to have all five
[1:32:57] you can't choose which one you want you
[1:33:01] cannot leave out the digestive system
[1:33:03] and ever live you cannot live out the
[1:33:06] endocrine system and ever lived but God
[1:33:09] placed them in our human body and God
[1:33:12] placed them in the spiritual body if we
[1:33:16] ever needed pastors we need them now if
[1:33:19] we ever needed Godly Holy Ghost filled
[1:33:21] evangelist and teacher come on somebody
[1:33:24] an apostle missionary we need them now
[1:33:28] and thank God if we need him we've got
[1:33:31] them because God placed them in the body
[1:33:34] not us
[1:33:39] ah
[1:33:46] another system in your body the
[1:33:49] endocrine
[1:33:50] and influences the function of the body
[1:33:54] using hormones
[1:33:57] now I find this absolutely amazing
[1:33:59] because the digestive system has nothing
[1:34:02] to do with this one but works together
[1:34:05] with it
[1:34:07] you know the prophet once they're only
[1:34:09] described
[1:34:10] a pastor and an evangelist and a teacher
[1:34:13] and told what they were
[1:34:15] and he said when asking the question
[1:34:17] actually 61 how do you know what you're
[1:34:20] supposed to do said well what I do is I
[1:34:22] look at the person that's claiming
[1:34:24] they're called to be this or that or the
[1:34:26] other because God will always work with
[1:34:28] this creature the way that he's made him
[1:34:32] so he said if a man's claiming that he's
[1:34:34] called to be a pastor a pastor cannot be
[1:34:37] a flighty person
[1:34:40] um
[1:34:40] yeah a pastor cannot be a man that's so
[1:34:44] easy discouraged you'll be surprised at
[1:34:47] the preachers that I have to encourage
[1:34:49] to come to church
[1:34:52] you'll be surprised at the preachers
[1:34:54] that I've had to encourage over the
[1:34:56] years to be faithful to the house of God
[1:35:02] but you want a man like that to be your
[1:35:03] pastor
[1:35:06] now can you imagine a man claiming that
[1:35:08] he's called to be an evangelist
[1:35:11] he Parks his car at Walmart
[1:35:13] and it takes him two hours and 47
[1:35:16] minutes to find it when he comes out
[1:35:18] he'll be late forever meeting he ever
[1:35:20] preaches
[1:35:21] he has no sense of direction this one's
[1:35:23] done one thing I tell Carol said if we
[1:35:25] did believe in wonderful preachers I
[1:35:26] know you ain't one because Carol gets
[1:35:28] off of an elevator and I'll tell her
[1:35:30] whatever comes instinctively for you to
[1:35:33] turn go the opposite way
[1:35:37] that's just the way it is bless her
[1:35:39] heart I love her and I love her to death
[1:35:41] I've been married to her for 50 years
[1:35:42] and she ain't never learned which way is
[1:35:44] the right way she'll be out there
[1:35:45] looking look and look and look and where
[1:35:47] do we part the car said you with me I'm
[1:35:49] good so as I said well what am I going
[1:35:51] to do if I have to go by myself I said
[1:35:53] find you a row number find you something
[1:35:56] or you can be like the Arab thing that
[1:35:58] somebody sent me not long ago and an
[1:36:00] Arab man suck out through there and it
[1:36:01] was all kinds of donkeys everywhere and
[1:36:03] he pulled out this remote out of his
[1:36:05] pocket went this when the donkey went ah
[1:36:10] so you see a man that's called to be an
[1:36:12] evangelist his makeup will be totally
[1:36:15] different from a pastor come on somebody
[1:36:17] that's the same way in the body of
[1:36:20] Christ that God places the system so the
[1:36:23] blood the blood the communication
[1:36:25] channel the electrical circuits and the
[1:36:28] body each one of them work together do
[1:36:31] you think you need electricity in your
[1:36:32] body
[1:36:33] we've had several people in our church
[1:36:35] and the Heart gets out of rhythm what is
[1:36:38] it most of the time the electrical side
[1:36:40] so they will have to go in there and
[1:36:43] what do they do to that heart do medical
[1:36:45] people tell me they shock it
[1:36:49] right
[1:36:50] oh why don't they use some other means
[1:36:52] because what's out of rhythm is the
[1:36:55] electrical part so they have to
[1:36:59] shock it in order to get it back in
[1:37:02] Rhythm uh-huh
[1:37:08] sometimes that's what we need
[1:37:11] sharks
[1:37:12] sometimes it's your electrical parts
[1:37:15] it's kind of all messed up you know your
[1:37:17] mechanics is good and this and that but
[1:37:18] you just ain't got enough humph about
[1:37:20] you you just ain't got enough
[1:37:22] electricity and you need a good
[1:37:23] electrical shock I got to come out kind
[1:37:25] of just smack around on you a little bit
[1:37:27] and I take my jumper cables
[1:37:30] they said all right I got I'm feeling
[1:37:32] better well praise the Lord that's good
[1:37:34] but you see hormones won't take care of
[1:37:37] that and some of the oxygen won't take
[1:37:39] care of it sometimes we need a good old
[1:37:41] electrical shock to put us back in
[1:37:44] Rhythm was what God's saying was what
[1:37:47] God's doing what's what God's got on his
[1:37:49] mind come on somebody whatever God wants
[1:37:52] it's what we want
[1:37:54] [Applause]
[1:37:58] praise the Lord
[1:38:01] the digestive system
[1:38:03] now this is probably one most of us are
[1:38:05] more familiar with than any other
[1:38:10] also the exitory system the system to
[1:38:14] absorb nutrients and remove waste via
[1:38:16] the gastrointestinal tract including the
[1:38:19] mouth esophagus stomach stomach and
[1:38:21] intestines now the endocrine system
[1:38:23] totally different
[1:38:25] it does with the hormones in the body
[1:38:30] now this word right here is that oh it
[1:38:32] is a doozy
[1:38:35] um
[1:38:36] if I want to pronounce it for me
[1:38:38] and take him in Terry
[1:38:42] well they all making no funny face so
[1:38:44] apparently y'all don't know it either
[1:38:46] integumentary system or and also the
[1:38:50] extra credit now that's the system that
[1:38:52] compromises or comprises rather the skin
[1:38:55] hair nails sweat another exocrine glands
[1:39:02] wow
[1:39:03] and that don't have nothing to do with
[1:39:05] electricity
[1:39:07] so what if you decide well I don't want
[1:39:09] this system no more you're going to look
[1:39:11] awful funny and walk around just muscles
[1:39:15] you see if we take away one of these
[1:39:18] we die
[1:39:21] we God that's just that simple
[1:39:27] the immune system
[1:39:28] and the lymphatic system
[1:39:32] defends the body against pathogens that
[1:39:35] may harm the body
[1:39:37] the system contains a network of
[1:39:41] lymphatic vessels
[1:39:42] that carry a clear fluid
[1:39:46] called lymph now notice even as
[1:39:48] important as the blood is
[1:39:50] these have their own route by which they
[1:39:53] travel
[1:39:54] designated vessels that carry lymph
[1:40:02] many of you know if you've had loved
[1:40:04] ones or friends or you've heard about
[1:40:05] people and they'd get cancer and they
[1:40:07] would go to checking what
[1:40:09] lymph glands right why that's where
[1:40:12] everything will go and the lamp will try
[1:40:15] to catch it and stop it and they'll go
[1:40:18] in and take out part of this and part of
[1:40:20] that
[1:40:21] you see this is why Satan hates
[1:40:24] real good old-fashioned gospel hard
[1:40:26] preaching
[1:40:27] he wants it to be all watered down he
[1:40:30] wants the lymph fluid to be kind of
[1:40:32] watery and weak
[1:40:35] and then sin begins to creep in the
[1:40:37] church and the preacher becomes afraid
[1:40:40] to preach anything because you might
[1:40:42] lose his job
[1:40:44] well praise the Lord we need some lymph
[1:40:48] fluids still flowing through the body
[1:40:49] don't we
[1:40:50] now notice the muscular system which
[1:40:54] enables the body to move using muscles
[1:40:59] nervous system collects and processes
[1:41:03] information from the senses via nerves
[1:41:07] and the brain and tells the muscles to
[1:41:12] contract to cause physical actions
[1:41:17] so what if the muscles got tired and say
[1:41:20] I am sick and tired of you
[1:41:24] Mr brain
[1:41:27] ever since I was a baby
[1:41:29] you have told me what to do
[1:41:33] whenever that doctor smacked me Mr brain
[1:41:36] it was you that told me and I kicked my
[1:41:39] little t-90 feet in my little legs
[1:41:43] who Do You Think You Are the boss
[1:41:46] just because you're at the top of the
[1:41:48] body does that mean you're the smart guy
[1:41:51] and I'm a dumb guy
[1:41:57] come on muscles
[1:42:02] well why don't we switch this around
[1:42:04] let's make the big toe the brain
[1:42:11] let's let it start telling us what to do
[1:42:17] you see God has a system like that in
[1:42:20] his church
[1:42:23] oh my Lord did I lose connection or
[1:42:25] something I mean
[1:42:28] this is why God sends one Prophet
[1:42:31] Messenger to the age
[1:42:34] and then he has other ministry under
[1:42:36] that and as they say Faithfully what he
[1:42:39] said then the body will move on until
[1:42:42] you get somebody in there that
[1:42:44] disconnects from the head and they say
[1:42:46] well I I'm not sure that that the
[1:42:49] prophet was right on that now I'm not
[1:42:51] sure well you know what our church is
[1:42:53] Sovereign you have to watch people when
[1:42:55] they go to say in that because what that
[1:42:57] means is this they feel like they have
[1:43:01] their own little Church of their own big
[1:43:02] church whatever it is and most of them
[1:43:04] when they go to say and they're
[1:43:05] Sovereign what that means is they don't
[1:43:08] go along with what the prophet taught
[1:43:09] about this or that or the other and
[1:43:11] somehow they fill out their little
[1:43:13] sovereignty in their body that gives
[1:43:15] them the authority to override the word
[1:43:17] and where did you read that in the comic
[1:43:20] books at because you sure never read it
[1:43:22] in the Bible
[1:43:23] come on somebody I don't we are
[1:43:26] sovereign body that's exactly right but
[1:43:29] none of us are sovereign over the top of
[1:43:32] God's word
[1:43:34] come on somebody no our sovereignty does
[1:43:37] not mean that we don't need the word and
[1:43:41] every word of it it simply means as a
[1:43:44] body we vote in our pastor our deacons
[1:43:47] so on and so on but every member of the
[1:43:50] body around the world this is what makes
[1:43:52] the bride an absolute phenomenon in that
[1:43:55] there will be people you and I have
[1:43:57] never met and yet they are moved upon by
[1:44:00] the same Holy Ghost they believe the
[1:44:02] same message that you believe they speak
[1:44:05] a different language they're raised in
[1:44:06] the in the jungles of India or Africa
[1:44:09] wherever more and yet when the Rapture
[1:44:11] takes place they'll stand right there
[1:44:13] before the Lord Jesus clothed in the
[1:44:16] garments of the word the same way you
[1:44:18] and I will come on somebody they may be
[1:44:21] speaking Hindi they may be speaking
[1:44:23] Afrikaans they may be speaking a
[1:44:25] language totally different from us but
[1:44:27] they will stand their Blood Washed Holy
[1:44:30] Ghost Field Spirit fed amen blessed name
[1:44:34] of the Lord why the same holy ghost in
[1:44:37] America the same holy ghost in Kenya the
[1:44:40] same holy ghost in Tanzania the same
[1:44:43] Holy Ghost around the world and the same
[1:44:45] Holy Ghost has got a digestive system
[1:44:48] and he's got to end the consistent and
[1:44:51] he's got an electrical system in the
[1:44:53] body and there ain't enough Devils out
[1:44:55] of hell to stop it there will be a bride
[1:44:58] because God said so I don't care how
[1:45:01] many preachers say it won't be I don't
[1:45:04] care how many believe the sound this and
[1:45:06] believe the sound that they will never
[1:45:09] stop God's bride because God himself
[1:45:13] said I will build this church and the
[1:45:18] Gates of Hell will not Prevail against
[1:45:21] it
[1:45:24] right
[1:45:32] praise the Lord
[1:45:36] there are nearly 46 miles
[1:45:39] of nerves
[1:45:41] in an adult's body
[1:45:44] the renal system in the urinary system
[1:45:47] the system where the kidneys filled to
[1:45:49] blood
[1:45:50] to produce urine and get rid of waste
[1:45:53] well sometimes we have to have a clean
[1:45:55] help system too
[1:45:57] I'll tell Carol sometimes I believe I
[1:45:58] work in the sanitation department of
[1:46:00] Heaven I hear so much jump so much trash
[1:46:02] try to help people clean out the garbage
[1:46:05] of their lives but somebody's got to do
[1:46:07] it
[1:46:10] aren't you glad God's got a cleanup
[1:46:12] system where would we be tonight
[1:46:15] if God didn't have men that knew how to
[1:46:18] clean up people's lives and how to guide
[1:46:21] them when they make absolute idiots out
[1:46:24] of themselves
[1:46:25] God's still got a cleanup system in the
[1:46:28] body Hallelujah some of our young people
[1:46:30] be leaving sometime early in the morning
[1:46:32] going up to a you can't some of them
[1:46:34] might need a little bit of digestive
[1:46:36] Department some of them might need a
[1:46:38] little bit of heart arrhythmia others
[1:46:40] might need this and that and the other
[1:46:41] but some of them might need up the
[1:46:43] cleanup department they might really
[1:46:45] need some of them men a God that's going
[1:46:47] to be preaching to get down in there and
[1:46:49] throw out a bunch of pornography out of
[1:46:51] their life and throw this out of their
[1:46:53] life I'm glad God's still got to clean
[1:46:55] up Department in the ministry well it
[1:46:58] ain't popular no I don't know any
[1:46:59] preachers that really wants to deal with
[1:47:01] it but I'm glad God still got some men
[1:47:03] they're not they're not ashamed to get
[1:47:06] in there and roll up her sleeve and get
[1:47:08] their hands dirty if they've got to why
[1:47:10] they love God sheep more than they love
[1:47:12] their pride
[1:47:15] hmm
[1:47:23] a couple more I didn't say I was done
[1:47:25] it's just going to let you rest a minute
[1:47:27] reproductive system
[1:47:30] reproductive organs required
[1:47:32] for the production of offspring
[1:47:35] now you know the sad thing about it is
[1:47:37] in some of these moves it's been around
[1:47:38] I know some of you don't even know them
[1:47:41] but one on the perusia
[1:47:43] basically saying Jesus has already come
[1:47:45] in 1963.
[1:47:47] they don't take communion no more they
[1:47:49] don't have revivals no more they don't
[1:47:51] believe in a move of God no more
[1:47:53] what's the matter with them the
[1:47:55] reproductive system is gone
[1:47:57] they're sterile
[1:47:59] that's why they have to steal members
[1:48:02] that's what they do now you notice a lot
[1:48:04] of these moves and you watch you watch
[1:48:06] the moves of the preachers that do them
[1:48:08] and you'll watch what they do they don't
[1:48:10] have the power to birth people so they
[1:48:13] steal people from other moves or other
[1:48:14] churches
[1:48:16] huh look look Stadium study every move
[1:48:20] that's been down through time and you'll
[1:48:21] watch what they do why they don't have
[1:48:23] life themself
[1:48:26] any god-called preacher has the ability
[1:48:29] to pass eternal life
[1:48:33] I'm sitting there look at me all bug
[1:48:35] eyed the prophet of God quoted that and
[1:48:38] said when Jesus said in Saint John 14 12
[1:48:40] these works that I do so you do later he
[1:48:42] said that greater work is imparting
[1:48:45] eternal life
[1:48:47] a real God called preacher has the power
[1:48:50] to beget children
[1:48:53] that's what I've told you before I'm not
[1:48:55] interested in trying to steal nobody's
[1:48:57] sheep from no other church I don't have
[1:48:59] to do it I don't have a father
[1:49:01] okay well Hallelujah I said I know how
[1:49:05] to file their children you know how I
[1:49:07] know I was taught by the father himself
[1:49:09] what are you talking about brother
[1:49:10] Donnie preached the word and it will
[1:49:13] beget his own kind so we don't have to
[1:49:16] apostolize people we don't have to go
[1:49:19] ahead and Rob from the Church of Christ
[1:49:20] and Rob from the Baptist and Rob from
[1:49:22] here and there I want to hear who God
[1:49:24] wants here is that what you want I don't
[1:49:26] have to go around telling people I've
[1:49:28] never begged one person to come here
[1:49:30] I've never pulled on one person I've
[1:49:33] never asked one person to come I've
[1:49:35] never spent no church and ain't going to
[1:49:37] start doing it now but I have the power
[1:49:40] if I'm filled with the holy ghost ever
[1:49:43] God call man brother John has the power
[1:49:45] bow the Holy Ghost living inside of him
[1:49:48] if he's part of this body he has a
[1:49:52] reproductive capability and the genus of
[1:49:55] God Amen that's why we do not have to
[1:49:59] apostasize people we don't have well
[1:50:02] let's go over and see if we can steal
[1:50:03] some from the Baptist let's see if we
[1:50:05] can steal some from the Pentecostal no
[1:50:07] sir let's not do it let's see if we can
[1:50:10] get them born again if they got a seed
[1:50:13] down inside their soul and they belong
[1:50:14] here so be it if they don't belong here
[1:50:17] I don't want them here myself
[1:50:19] okay
[1:50:25] Jesus
[1:50:28] the respiratory system
[1:50:30] brings air into and out of the lungs to
[1:50:36] absorb oxygen and remove carbon dioxide
[1:50:39] Indian amazing same lungs brings oxygen
[1:50:42] in takes carbon dioxide out so the same
[1:50:47] preacher that can bring you Joy can make
[1:50:49] you mad on a hornet
[1:50:51] the same preacher that can make you feel
[1:50:53] like shouting can also make you feel
[1:50:55] like pouting
[1:50:57] skeletal system bones maintain the
[1:50:59] structure of the body and its organs
[1:51:01] oh
[1:51:03] how wonderfully
[1:51:07] may I say to the bride of Christ around
[1:51:10] the world
[1:51:12] dear lovely elect lady
[1:51:15] how wonderfully
[1:51:18] mermaid
[1:51:20] no wonder Satan fights these in the
[1:51:23] natural body
[1:51:24] and fights them
[1:51:26] spiritual body
[1:51:29] we do ourselves and our move a great
[1:51:31] credit when we try to make everybody
[1:51:33] like us
[1:51:36] every Ministry the same
[1:51:41] we're not every Ministry the same
[1:51:43] but what we want to be is have the same
[1:51:46] motive the same objective the same
[1:51:49] desire
[1:51:50] right
[1:51:52] you ever notice do you ever think about
[1:51:54] it we'll get into it in a few weeks
[1:51:56] I wonder why Paul never did write a
[1:51:58] letter
[1:51:59] to the church at Jerusalem
[1:52:03] I wonder why Paul never did write a
[1:52:04] letter
[1:52:05] to some of the other churches that Peter
[1:52:07] established
[1:52:10] not the original Church some other
[1:52:12] church was in Jerusalem
[1:52:15] I wonder why Paul didn't go to that
[1:52:16] church and preach and hold revivals
[1:52:21] I have the answer but I'm going to tell
[1:52:22] you
[1:52:24] I said I've not made you mad now
[1:52:29] don't you love him
[1:52:31] don't you want to be
[1:52:33] whatever God
[1:52:34] made you to me
[1:52:39] if I have to work for the Sewer
[1:52:40] Department Of Heaven
[1:52:42] praise God some of them people I pulled
[1:52:45] out of the sewer
[1:52:46] and I got Mighty smelly with them
[1:52:48] we'll walk down the streets of gold one
[1:52:50] day
[1:52:52] oh my some of the other preachers my
[1:52:54] buddies and my friends and my pals oh
[1:52:57] goodness gracious
[1:52:59] they're not really in the sewer
[1:53:00] department of Heaven they worked for the
[1:53:02] florist of Heaven
[1:53:04] they get to do all the fine freely nasty
[1:53:08] things of Heaven
[1:53:10] others of us have to get down and roll
[1:53:12] up our sleeves and do this and that and
[1:53:14] everything God did you hate me
[1:53:19] but aren't you glad God's got different
[1:53:21] ones in the body
[1:53:24] to do different things and you see this
[1:53:26] is where we get in trouble
[1:53:27] because we'll look at someone else's
[1:53:29] position and say why can't I be like
[1:53:32] that
[1:53:33] and preachers if they're not careful
[1:53:36] will change their Administration
[1:53:39] and they'll start finding the edge
[1:53:42] of where they're supposed to be and move
[1:53:45] slot right of it
[1:53:47] just to be a little bit more likeable
[1:53:50] you never know what they believe
[1:53:52] you never know exactly where they stand
[1:53:54] on this or that or the other
[1:53:55] because they're not really going to say
[1:53:58] and if they're being recorded of what
[1:54:00] they're going to preach they're never
[1:54:01] going to say anything that's going to
[1:54:03] get them on CNN
[1:54:06] never
[1:54:08] I know that may hurt some of you but it
[1:54:10] ain't nothing but the gospel truth
[1:54:18] so little electricity
[1:54:21] little finger
[1:54:23] little toe little nose a little ear
[1:54:27] whatever God's calls you to be
[1:54:30] walk out of here tonight with a changed
[1:54:32] View
[1:54:33] of yourself
[1:54:35] and maybe that brother or sister sitting
[1:54:37] around you that you just don't
[1:54:38] understand and you think and they don't
[1:54:40] understand me well they probably don't
[1:54:43] but yet if God has placed Us in the body
[1:54:47] cannot we all work together for one
[1:54:49] common goal
[1:54:52] let me just share this with you there
[1:54:53] was a certain preacher several years ago
[1:54:55] and he did a lot of prison work
[1:54:58] he come and visited us and I went to the
[1:55:01] prison with him some
[1:55:03] and that's a different thing altogether
[1:55:05] believe me going to prison and preaching
[1:55:08] to people of all kinds
[1:55:10] and this brother was so critical
[1:55:13] of everybody that didn't preach in
[1:55:15] prisons
[1:55:17] and I went with him to this certain
[1:55:19] place
[1:55:20] and you talking about feeling out of
[1:55:22] place I mean I felt out of place
[1:55:25] but this man prior to his conversion
[1:55:28] had been in prison
[1:55:30] he was a criminal
[1:55:32] so he'd been in prison so I watched him
[1:55:35] as he got up he got up before I did
[1:55:37] and I watched him as he got up and he
[1:55:40] started using all these terms
[1:55:43] it was about like speaking in tongues to
[1:55:45] me
[1:55:46] I mean I didn't understand hardly
[1:55:47] nothing the man was saying laugher and
[1:55:50] two-timer and this and that and the
[1:55:52] other thing what in the world
[1:55:55] but this man knew the lingo
[1:55:58] that would get to those people that was
[1:56:01] in prison
[1:56:02] and I watched in just a few minutes
[1:56:04] first time they'd ever seen him had
[1:56:06] never been to this particular prison
[1:56:08] but yet there was a connection that was
[1:56:10] made with them people
[1:56:13] and I thought isn't that amazing that
[1:56:16] God never put the man in there but God
[1:56:18] took him from what Satan did and turned
[1:56:20] it around to be able to use it now here
[1:56:22] I get up
[1:56:25] you know my background
[1:56:27] only prison I've ever seen whenever
[1:56:29] daddy smacked me a few times
[1:56:33] so I felt so out of place
[1:56:37] but I preached on
[1:56:39] a conscience being purged
[1:56:42] and what I found was I made a connection
[1:56:44] with their souls
[1:56:47] not with their lingo
[1:56:50] I don't know how many of them hardened
[1:56:52] criminals come and give their heart to
[1:56:54] God
[1:56:56] went to another state exact same thing
[1:56:58] happened again
[1:57:00] and I told this brother all brother
[1:57:02] Donny people I'll take a bunch of these
[1:57:04] lazy preachers I said brother
[1:57:06] I said I watched you as you operated
[1:57:08] like that I said everybody's not called
[1:57:10] to do that
[1:57:11] I said let me ask you this he's been to
[1:57:14] our church
[1:57:16] and I said how would you like to walk
[1:57:18] out here before these hundreds of people
[1:57:19] that I pastor
[1:57:21] and you have to deal with the garbage in
[1:57:23] their lives
[1:57:24] you have to deal with our fusses and
[1:57:26] their arguing you have to deal with them
[1:57:28] when they become dilator and they won't
[1:57:30] come to church one little thing and they
[1:57:32] stay home and go to Walmart I run into
[1:57:34] them at Food City after I've been to
[1:57:36] church and preached like a horse and
[1:57:38] then I ran into them grocery shopping
[1:57:40] they say ah brother Donnie I didn't know
[1:57:43] I was going to see you here I was like
[1:57:44] no you sure didn't did you let's see the
[1:57:47] church no no no
[1:57:53] it's amazing how people can do whenever
[1:57:56] they
[1:57:58] said I couldn't take it I said see
[1:58:01] so if everybody was natured like you
[1:58:03] there'd be no pastors to be able to deal
[1:58:06] with the same people over and over and
[1:58:09] over again know their worst mistakes
[1:58:13] know their greatest shortcomers and you
[1:58:15] see that's why a man that's not called
[1:58:17] to be a pastor does not need to be one
[1:58:20] because a god-called pastor can hear
[1:58:22] your worst mistakes he can hear the
[1:58:25] filth of your life
[1:58:29] and pray you back through to repentance
[1:58:32] and the next time he sees you he can
[1:58:34] look at you with love in his heart and
[1:58:37] put his arm around you and feel the same
[1:58:40] towards you that he did before he heard
[1:58:43] your terrible terrible sins
[1:58:45] but a man who ain't called to be a
[1:58:48] pastor can't do that
[1:58:53] do we need them all we do
[1:58:56] I need every system in my body
[1:58:59] did anybody think of one tonight when I
[1:59:01] was describing you that you just decided
[1:59:03] I don't want it no more I'm tired of it
[1:59:06] I mean I
[1:59:09] we need them all
[1:59:11] do we need evangelists in our church
[1:59:14] do we need preachers that'll come in
[1:59:16] from other places and preach to our
[1:59:18] church
[1:59:20] do they need prayer lines and do we need
[1:59:23] men that will preach in a different way
[1:59:25] some that might go deeper than others
[1:59:27] and some shallower than others and some
[1:59:30] move around more than others do we need
[1:59:32] them
[1:59:34] do you need people that don't always go
[1:59:36] along with you
[1:59:38] I'm surprised I got so many amends on
[1:59:40] that
[1:59:41] actually we do
[1:59:45] don't you love him with all your heart
[1:59:49] the sparrow handsome
[1:59:53] praise the Lord
[1:59:57] wow father
[2:00:01] what a great thing you made when you
[2:00:03] made a man
[2:00:06] all these things about us Lord and
[2:00:09] probably one of the medical people
[2:00:10] tonight would know
[2:00:13] what I've spoken about maybe
[2:00:16] and know much more of course than what I
[2:00:18] have
[2:00:19] but these things go on within us and
[2:00:21] have every day of our life
[2:00:23] and we don't even realize it
[2:00:26] Lord it is so easy for us to judge and
[2:00:30] categorize and well they're not like our
[2:00:32] church and they Don't Preach like our
[2:00:34] pastor and
[2:00:36] oh help us Lord
[2:00:39] no wonder the prophet told us not to be
[2:00:43] cliques and Clans
[2:00:45] make ourselves clannish
[2:00:48] but to love one another
[2:00:50] to be a part of one another
[2:00:53] Lord whatever we are tonight in the body
[2:00:56] help us
[2:00:58] Lord I I can't say
[2:01:02] I'll be honest with you sir
[2:01:04] I can't say I enjoy
[2:01:07] always in my part
[2:01:10] there's lots of my part I don't enjoy
[2:01:13] I'm sure with every other man
[2:01:18] and yet Lord the same blood that carries
[2:01:20] nutrients
[2:01:21] will carry out excretions
[2:01:25] the same lungs it brings in fresh air
[2:01:28] and in my lungs would have given out
[2:01:30] about 55 minutes ago or so whenever I
[2:01:33] started
[2:01:34] I would have not have completed the
[2:01:36] sermon
[2:01:37] so they were bringing in fresh oxygen
[2:01:41] taking out the carbon dioxide
[2:01:43] all of us as we have set here we have in
[2:01:46] and out in and out in and out
[2:01:50] our blood has traveled No Doubt
[2:01:54] couple of hundred and maybe even a
[2:01:56] couple of thousand miles or we've been
[2:01:58] sitting right here
[2:02:00] all this going on inside of our body
[2:02:03] and we're totally unaware of it
[2:02:06] Lord God it makes me appreciate so much
[2:02:09] how you made us
[2:02:11] you're an awesome God
[2:02:13] I thank you for my heart I thank you for
[2:02:15] my legs I thank you for my feet I thank
[2:02:17] you for my lungs
[2:02:19] I thank you for all that Lord
[2:02:21] Lord then I thank you
[2:02:23] for the ministry
[2:02:25] Lord I Thank you for those that preached
[2:02:27] different from me
[2:02:29] I thank you for those Lord that you may
[2:02:31] anoint to go in a Direction that's
[2:02:33] totally different not not not error
[2:02:36] but yeah Lord see things in just a
[2:02:39] little different way to illuminate us
[2:02:41] that we might benefit one another
[2:02:44] so we can see from looking at these
[2:02:46] systems and we could take the
[2:02:48] restrictions and the limitations of each
[2:02:50] one of these systems in the body and
[2:02:52] realize not one system is complete
[2:02:55] within itself
[2:02:58] but you divided the body into these
[2:03:01] systems in each one when it works
[2:03:03] properly complements the other and keeps
[2:03:06] all of the systems and the body working
[2:03:08] together and what does it produce when
[2:03:11] they're all doing it a body in the land
[2:03:13] of good health
[2:03:15] but all it takes is one
[2:03:18] one system
[2:03:19] to mess up Lord today from our church we
[2:03:23] had three of our our sheep
[2:03:26] having surgery
[2:03:28] three different ones had surgery today
[2:03:31] Lord they went into the hospital early
[2:03:33] this morning and knowing what the
[2:03:36] doctors had told them and
[2:03:38] father thankfully all three from the
[2:03:41] last I've heard will went well the
[2:03:43] surgery went good but no doubt they feel
[2:03:45] so tender
[2:03:47] around those positions tonight of
[2:03:49] surgery and tomorrow and especially the
[2:03:52] third day it'll be so sensitive that'll
[2:03:55] be the focal point of everything they'll
[2:03:58] pay their attention to
[2:04:00] Lord the brother with a torn meniscus
[2:04:02] he'll ought to be so careful
[2:04:05] not to bend his knee and not to walk and
[2:04:07] not to fall
[2:04:09] the other brother Heaven repairs and his
[2:04:12] hernia another individual Lord don't
[2:04:16] have to be so careful and so cautious
[2:04:20] Lord help us I pray father that when we
[2:04:22] have members of our body
[2:04:24] that maybe they're going through a
[2:04:25] surgical procedure and they need a
[2:04:27] little bit of special attention may we
[2:04:29] be able to reach out to him father maybe
[2:04:32] be able to love and just be a crutch to
[2:04:35] them if they need it
[2:04:36] Lord just be a little walking stick if
[2:04:39] they needed to till they get over it
[2:04:42] oh Father we want to minister to one
[2:04:44] another
[2:04:45] because who knows next week it might be
[2:04:48] me in in the need of a crutch it might
[2:04:51] be me Lord in the need of a little
[2:04:53] little help because I had a little
[2:04:56] surgical repair myself
[2:04:58] we need you Lord oh we all say that
[2:05:02] but help us not to stop there but help
[2:05:04] us to go on and say we also need one
[2:05:08] another
[2:05:10] one another
[2:05:12] we love you father
[2:05:15] with our heads bowed Before I Let You Go
[2:05:18] I wonder how many of you you see brother
[2:05:20] Donnie I never quite looked at it that
[2:05:22] way before
[2:05:23] I want to be what God Made Me
[2:05:26] I I want to be able to function better
[2:05:28] in the body
[2:05:30] would you just raise your hand to the
[2:05:31] Lord man women boys girls young men
[2:05:34] young sisters
[2:05:36] to be able to function
[2:05:38] in the body
[2:05:41] someone may need you
[2:05:43] to be able to help carry them
[2:05:45] you've heard the story I know brother
[2:05:47] Daryl told it to me again the other day
[2:05:51] it was told in Wartime
[2:05:53] our troops was having to leave this
[2:05:56] certain place I was under
[2:05:58] heavy gunfire
[2:06:02] and they were
[2:06:04] trained and taught to bring their
[2:06:06] wounded out
[2:06:09] but they was bearing down on them and
[2:06:12] the commanding officer saw this young
[2:06:13] man
[2:06:14] and he was carrying this fella this
[2:06:17] fella he was carrying was way bigger
[2:06:18] than him
[2:06:19] and he said soldier
[2:06:21] dropped that man
[2:06:24] then he turned back around giving orders
[2:06:26] to others he turned back around to look
[2:06:28] at that man and he said I told you to
[2:06:30] drop that man
[2:06:33] the young man kept packing him
[2:06:36] he turns a third time and said I give
[2:06:38] you a direct order
[2:06:41] dropped that man he's too heavy
[2:06:43] you can't carry him
[2:06:47] he said sir
[2:06:49] I can't leave him behind
[2:06:52] he's my brother
[2:06:55] so here was two brothers that were
[2:06:57] fighting in the same
[2:06:59] platoon and in the same battle
[2:07:01] and his brother had got wounded natural
[2:07:04] brother
[2:07:07] but he just couldn't leave him behind
[2:07:11] it's strange but we're one of the only
[2:07:14] armies
[2:07:15] that kick our own wounded
[2:07:18] we leave our wounded behind we step on
[2:07:21] them we find them down and we push them
[2:07:24] further down
[2:07:26] where one of the few armies that's been
[2:07:28] down through time they're crucifying our
[2:07:31] own leaders
[2:07:33] and divide our own platoons
[2:07:39] we break ranks
[2:07:42] you understand if this was an Army some
[2:07:44] preachers would be court-martialed
[2:07:47] because they break ranks and pull out
[2:07:50] from under a leader that God sends
[2:07:53] and will make their own platoon
[2:07:56] if they was in the military
[2:07:59] in the Civil War days I'll tell you what
[2:08:01] had happened to them they shot him
[2:08:04] they shot him on the spot
[2:08:08] look friends don't just look and say
[2:08:11] well brother Donny's position is so
[2:08:13] important it's not just my position
[2:08:15] that's important your position
[2:08:18] is important if God has given you a post
[2:08:21] of Duty you know what that means
[2:08:25] as it was in an army where the word
[2:08:28] comes from
[2:08:29] then you're said over a certain spot and
[2:08:32] you guard that spot
[2:08:34] if it's the rear flank if it's whatever
[2:08:36] it is then if you're not at your post
[2:08:40] and the enemy comes through and says
[2:08:42] you're not where you're supposed to be
[2:08:44] that will be the very Avenue that they
[2:08:47] will make their approach
[2:08:49] and come right in how many innocent
[2:08:51] lives might be lost
[2:08:53] because you was not at your post
[2:08:57] it's not just a preacher it's not just
[2:08:59] the deacons and the musicians
[2:09:01] but every one of you
[2:09:04] you have a post
[2:09:05] a position
[2:09:07] you don't answer to me
[2:09:09] you answered almighty God
[2:09:13] oh my
[2:09:15] Hallelujah
[2:09:17] how many wants to be in your post
[2:09:20] how many wants to be in your position
[2:09:21] remember one of the Prophecies of the
[2:09:23] last days in the Book of Joel
[2:09:25] and it was they would not break their
[2:09:29] ranks
[2:09:31] they would not break their ranks
[2:09:35] but they would stay where they were
[2:09:37] positionally placed
[2:09:39] and they would not leave for mother
[2:09:41] father no one else
[2:09:43] because they knew God had given them a
[2:09:46] position
[2:09:47] oh my
[2:09:49] help us Lord
[2:09:52] help us Lord
[2:09:54] praise the Lord
[2:09:57] take your weapons friends
[2:09:59] stand at your post of Duty my brother
[2:10:02] Donnie I'm just a layperson well you say
[2:10:04] that as if though that's not important
[2:10:05] that is very important what good would
[2:10:08] it do me to study days on end
[2:10:11] how long you figured it took me to put
[2:10:12] together the sermon tonight
[2:10:14] how much searching do you figure it took
[2:10:16] me hours and hours on end
[2:10:20] and what good would it have done if I
[2:10:23] would have come and preached it with no
[2:10:25] one here
[2:10:26] you reckon these chairs would have been
[2:10:28] blessed
[2:10:29] you reckon these chairs would have said
[2:10:31] amen I want to be that
[2:10:34] it's not for chairs
[2:10:35] it's not for carpet
[2:10:38] it's for people
[2:10:39] what makes a preacher's sermon worth
[2:10:41] preaching people there
[2:10:44] to take what he preached and live it
[2:10:48] and become it
[2:10:50] I believe that's what many of you desire
[2:10:52] to do tonight
[2:10:54] oh praise the Lord sing something for us
[2:10:57] Harry can we just worship a little bit
[2:11:00] think about the great mystery that you
[2:11:02] are as you stand there tonight now some
[2:11:05] of you as we start singing you'll start
[2:11:07] opening your mouth these processes that
[2:11:09] I've told you about tonight they'll be
[2:11:11] ongoing some of you will lift your hand
[2:11:13] you don't even think about doing you
[2:11:15] know where it comes from your brain and
[2:11:18] then your brain sends that signal
[2:11:20] traveling up to 200 miles an hour and
[2:11:24] all of a sudden this hand goes up and
[2:11:26] then that one goes up and then your eyes
[2:11:29] of course where'd this all come from the
[2:11:31] command center you've got to have a
[2:11:34] place that is the headquarters if not
[2:11:37] this one will go up sporadic that one
[2:11:39] will it'll go this way it'll go that way
[2:11:41] you've got to have a place that is the
[2:11:44] headquarters God has always had that you
[2:11:47] testify that the people who say they
[2:11:49] don't need a head they're false
[2:11:51] prophetess and Prophets their own body
[2:11:54] is telling them totally different if you
[2:11:58] need a brain you'll also need a pastor
[2:12:03] your own body testifies of the headship
[2:12:05] needed in a body and a pastor also needs
[2:12:09] a head which is the word
[2:12:13] praise the Lord can we just worship him
[2:12:16] a little bit before we go
