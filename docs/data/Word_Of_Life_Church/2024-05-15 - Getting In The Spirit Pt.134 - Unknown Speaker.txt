[Applause] Lord will'll be going home thank you Lord Jesus Heavenly Father we know that's been said for over 2,000 years now that early church when they saw you ascend up on the Mount of Ascension no doubt they went around telling everybody it may not be but a week or maybe a month or maybe a year he'll be back that generation passed the Next Generation started believing the same thing and the next and the next and the next here we are 2,000 years later and we're believing the same thing but Lord God We Believe by prophecy and the things that we can see in your word that there has never been a generation that's as close as we are therefore father the sincere Cry of our heart is we want to be ready above everything in our life so this is one of the reasons that we come together tonight your Prophet has told us that when we come to church we come to be told about our wrongs our shortcomings where we mess up I realize that's unusual because a lot of folks don't go to church for that reason anymore more but we do we want to know where we're wrong so we can fix it we want to know what we can do to be a people that's better pleasing to you we ask tonight that you would take your word and speak to us father help me to get out of the way anoint me anoint the people that we can be able to make this service what you want it to be help us to realize that you are not going to commend this service tonight and take over the preacher and take over the leoty take over the musicians take over the singers and you're just going to do it all you will use us but you want our effort amen father I want to present everything I am to you tonight May the people give their amens may they give their praise the Lords may they give their pullings on the gift tonight father so that this service can be something of Eternal value in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen praise the Lord ain't God good amen oh he is so good praise the Lord Revelation chap 10 verse one question and answers tomorrow night at 7:00 we got some really good questions to look at by the help of the Lord also be streaming that for those of you old people that can come to the young people's service so I tell you that've been a blessing not only to the youths but I've heard from people all over the world that just really enjoying him and benefiting that's that's wonderful that's why we do it Revelation 10 verse one and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and notice all these verses are filled with symbolisms so it's not real plain it's hid behind types and an types and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven now this is a sworn affidavit and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are in the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and the people of God said amen may the Lord bless his word you may be seated Read With Me Now from The Book of Ruth chapter 4 verse 9 and Boaz said unto the elders and unto all the people ye are witnesses this day that I have bought all that was elik all that was chilion and maon of the hand of Naomi moreover Ruth the moabitas the wife of mean have I purchased to be my wife now remember this is kinsman redeemer that we're talking about to raise up the name of the Dead upon his inheritance that the name of the Dead be not cut off from among his Brethren I want you to notice these next words and from the Gate of his place I want you to see that his emphasis is to raise up the inheritance of Maan Maan had died without seed so the leverate marriage was that the next of Ken and the family would take this Widow and marry the Widow and the firstborn would bear the name of Malon he would also get a double portion of the inheritance now Boaz is willing to do this this is going to cost him a great deal Boaz is a wealthy man so he will have to take of his own inheritance in order to bring this to pass if he follows through with this now watch what he says that the name of the Dead be not cut off from among his Brethren and from the Gate of of his place from the Gate of his place this is taking place at Bethlehem why Bethlehem Bethlehem was the headquarters or the seat of the government of the place where their possession was so he could not go to another city in a nearby City and be able to make this legal transaction at the gate at another town so it must be the gate by which maon chilion and their father on The Inheritance so where was Naomi's inheritance under the jurisdiction of Bethlehem which is what house of God's bread now I want you to realize how that he emphasizes the inheritance and he also emphasizes the gate of his place ye are witnesses this day so he goes before the Elders of the little town of bethelem because this is the Gate of the jurisdiction of The Inheritance that he's going to purchase now I want you to I want you to think with me tonight that the Bible tells us about the Lord Jesus that when he come to the Earth and when he died and gave his life that he suffered without the gate now there's two places in Israel that they attribute could be Calvary one is called Gordon's Calvary and then the other we went there five or six years ago whenever we were there and it's near the bus station and it actually looks like a place of a skull because of the formation of the Rocks it's not the traditional one that most of them accept as Calvary which probably pretty well tells you that's the right one uh you know every other place that the church recognized which if you're not familiar with it it was actually Constantine's mother the Roman emperor Constantine it was his mother that went to Israel and begin to search for all the so-called holy places and after she found them by tradition then she set up want to build a church here you know Monastery whatever more here there and there so there is places that are accepted by the religious world that are that and then there's other places which was passed down by the tradition of some of the apostolic fathers which is the one I tend to follow so Calvary is the same way actually two places of the garden tomb to places of Calvary but whenever you look at it and you realize that one of them is outside of the city gate now one thing that a lot of Christians do not understand is that the Lord Jesus at Calvary he purchased and paid the price so that the book of redemption could be taken but he did not take it at Calvary the book was was not there I know emphasize to you again Wednesday night I want to emphasize it again tonight that the book was not there he could not take the book at Calvary he had to wait until he became righteous again I know that's staggering and I know it's mindboggling but think about it he could not have taken the book of redemption at the cross he had to wait till he was righteous again you understand because at the cross he died the death not of a righteous man but of a sinner not because of what he did but of what he become so he could not become a curse in the eyes of God and walk up before the Throne of God and take the book out of God's hand so the book was not at the cross I'm afraid even some of our message Brothers do not comprehend this is why they don't preach the opening of the seals this is why they see no significance brother Joe of talking about the Thunders in the book and it being our inheritance this is why even in our own ranks they still are emphasizing only at the cross itself and remember we can never have the book without the cross but we can never get our inheritance without both so the cross paved the way by which the lamb could take the book which he could not do at Calvary because he became our sin he who knew no sin became our sin that we might become the very righteousness of God so he could not be a sinner son at the same time no more than you and I could so he forfeited his rights to sunship listen to it forsaking all Phoenix 1962 In The Garden of Gethsemane the anointing left him and he had to die on the cross a curse in the eyes of God so the book could not be taken he had to wait till he returned to that state of righteousness again so it must be the consignment and the full operation of redemption had to be back at the Gate of his city which was not Jerusalem so where must Jesus take the book it must be Hallelujah it must be back at his City Boaz had to make this legal contract of marriage where at the Gate of the city of Beth elim Beth elim which was whose City milon's City so it must be reconciliation and Redemption to make it legal it must been acted upon by Boaz in the front of witnesses at milon's City Gate the Lord Jesus could not take the book outside of Jerusalem's gate he could pay the price and as Paul tells us that he suffered without the gate but remember the book and the marriage of redemption and the reconciliation of all of those attributes that was in God's mind had to be witnessed at the Gate of his City not natural Jerusalem so what was the gate of the city of the Lamb of God the New Jerusalem so the reconciliation the price certainly was paid at Calvary and there the blood the subaryanto and she comes before him no doubt as was her custom and she would fall down before him to take him by the legs and simply Embrace him around the legs and he said touch me not don't you touch me I have not yet ascended to my God and your God I have not ascended up but after he goes up and then comes back when he meets with his brothers he tells them touch me handle me see I'm I'm like you I'm like you only in a glorified form now what had happened in between the time that he told Mary not to touch him and when Thomas said I will not believe until I thrust my hand in his side and until I put my fingers in the prince in his hand and when Jesus comes he said oh hail touch me Thomas so the blood the high priest had now taken the blood before the mercy seat which is before the Eternal and offered the blood as an Aton for every person's name who was in the Lamb's Personal Diary he is offered before the father because the sacrifice of the high priest's body could not be tainted by Humanity but once the sacrifice has been made then he comes back he eats with his brothers they handle him they sit down and eat and they no doubt they touch him and they rub him and oh Jesus we love you so much but now it could be done because he was righteous again oh glory to God don't you understand he had to become in an unrighteous State he forfeited all of that and kicked off his shoe of dignity he kicked off his resplendant glory he kicked off all of that to take upon him our sin our Darkness our wretchedness and become oh oh my everything that we needed he became that and then when he did he must finalize this contract before the Gate of his City you see had Boaz went to a city in Ephraim had he went to a another city this contract with Ruth would not have been binding but it was binding only if the kinsman redeemer went to the city where the inheritance laid praise be to God can't you understand why didn't go down to Hell and get the book cuz the devil didn't have the book and your inheritance was not in Hell well praise be to God you had nothing in Hell brother Donnie ain't you scared of going to hell I didn't come from hell I ain't going to hell come on somebody I am from the mind of God and that's where I'm going back to no sir there's nothing about hell that sounds like home to me I don't cry when I your preachers preach about hell but I sure do cry when I hear them preach about heaven I I do cry when I hear singers sing about heaven because that sounds like home to me I ain't worried about going to hell I didn't come from there there's nothing about me that lines up with hell I was only the under the influence of that for a short time in my life but those days are gone and my king rose up and he went before the Gate of our city where our inheritance lay and before Witnesses he said let it be known this day I have redeemed my predestinated bride every thought that was in my mind let it be known that I have redeemed her she is my wife and in every one of them in their season they will come to me I don't care how darkness in I don't care how lost and sin they are I'll get them if I've got to knock them in the head I'll get them if I've got to break the leg I'll do whatever I got to do I declare It In The City Gate she is mine Satan take your hand off of my wife notice he says moreover Ruth and mo is the wife of meon if I purchased to be my wife to raise up the name name of the Dead upon his inheritance that the name of the Dead be not cut off from among his Brethren from the gate from the Gate of his place from the Gate of his place so when we look in Revelation five then we see the book in the hands of the great Creator which come back from the hands of Adam there it had been for all these thousands of years waiting for what a kinsman redeemer a goel one that would be able to pay the price then come back through the city gate and be able to walk up before the Throne of God and be able to reach force and take that book and be able to say I did it and it must be one without fault it must be one without blame don't you understand why I could not do that at the cross the book was not at the cross what was at the cross was the altar it was the altar by which the precious blood must be spilled on the altar but Revelation five was calling for what let one can come to take the book and what did John see he saw one proceed forth out of the Throne of God it was a lamb having been slain notice been rest restored back to the place of righteousness John did not see a sinner John did not see a serpent I wish somebody would preach with me tonight John did not see an unrighteous person standing there or a man who took the sin of the world but John said a lamb come amen a lamb come and took that book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he did the witness is fell down oh glory to God what was it he walked back through the gate of the city where your inheritance like let me tell you tonight Church your inheritance ain't in Johnson City it's not in the United States it's not in an America it's not in Canada your inheritance was in heaven and the Lord Jesus walked right through the gate and said I have completed the task I have paid the price now I want my bride book I want my bride's [Applause] inheritance oh praise the Lord and I I think that we as a people of God and we could ever come to this simple realization we do not belong to ourselves praise the Lord but we belong to him because he purchases read with me in 1 Corinthians 6:20 for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are yours y'all don't believe that they're yours but why do we claim them why do we act like they're ours why do we act like that we are the B B of our body if I want to look this way do this say that act this way I'm going to do it and ain't nobody going to tell me what to do now you're acting like you're the boss now you're acting like you own you but you don't own you not if you're bride now now if you're L to seea and foolish virgins and you know whatever more then yeah go ahead but if we're bride we are not our own for you are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are God 7: 23 ye are bought with a price be not ye the Servants of men are you realize how much easier that we could all make our lives as Christians and brothers and sisters in serving the lord if we would come to that realization and keep it before us every day of Our Lives because a lot of our battles in serving the lord has to do with procession rights of who really owns us and if the Lord then orchestrates something in our life that we don't understand and we have a hard time then what do a lot of people do they want to assert well I don't understand why you did this why would you do this to me this is not fair this is not right this is you know on and on and on we go and why do we do that is because we've not fully committed yet to this aspect right here that we do not belong to ourself we are owned by almighty God he bought us he paid for us he done everything that was needed and we are his property so if he wants to raise us up he can do it if he wants to push us down he can if he wants to heal us he can if he wants to let us go by the way of the Grave he can do that and we shouldn't say anything but that's the part we struggle with notice this the prophet goes on to say man is not a property of the church neither is man a property of the state but man is property of God Sons and Daughters of God we belong to him because we are bought with a price and what a precious price the Son of God now we are bought but think of it now unlike things that you would buy with your money uh we are bought with something that is not separate from what we actually are now let me let me make sure you understand it that in order to have a currency which would be spendable for a soul God must have a currency which would be able to be used in a way in the Bank of Heaven I've told you in traveling around the world and all and many places I go I don't necessarily need to change money but in some places they won't take the US dollar and some places they won't take a credit card so you will change it say in Israel you change it to shekels and and uh in China you change it to a different in Zimbabwe you change it to Zim which is Zimbabwe dollars and you change it to different places and then they will always of course exact a usually amount out of that for you so you walk in there you may have $5,000 in your pocket but they say oh no we don't take US Dollars well if you've got a need then you've got to change something in order to be able to get what you need God had a need for his attributes to be expressed and the bank of Heaven would not take sinful dollars it would not take Zimbabwe sinful dollars American sinful dollars we'd say so God had to create a currency that would be able to be acknowledged by the individuals on the earth and they would have to accept it and then it would also be honored in the Bank Of Heaven by which the recipients of that currency could be released from their debt y all follow me tonight now he knew we could not do it on our own so we don't work for it we don't go out and work a week's wages and God said well if you do this and this and this and I'll give you this much and then you can trade that in for your salvation no I don't work for one ounce of my salvation it's a free gift from almighty God but I work after I'm saved because I love him so God gave me then and you this currency which the bank of Heaven is the only currency that it will recognize it will not recognize denominational currency it won't recognize your Works your good efforts all of that nope it will not work at all so God himself must change himself into a currency which will be accepted back by his own bank so what did he do he con and sined into this low State and he changed himself in currency so he paid himself in Son of God form he paid himself Spirit form with this currency of sunship that's the way the reconciliation price was made God paid it in the form of sunship everybody follow me the form of sunship was the condescended act of God by which he would use so the spirit as John saw it he saw a lamb come out of the Throne of God not another God but it was the same God in a form which was accepted so then when you and I receive that in the fullness of its atonement then we need salvation okay but there's the currency you need healing well there's the currency to pay for well whenever we go on then those who receive the fullness of the word they're going to need a body change well you know what you've already got the currency living inside of you right now it's already there every time you get a Divine Healing that is a little bit of a miniature body change in you right then every miracle that we've seen happen in our church it's a little it's a little small but very very significant a very small form or down payment of the body change every Divine Healing that God does every day we live by this currency that he's given us aren't you grateful and think of it we were poor lost wretched Sinners but he loved us so much and he settled it at the gate now the price was paid to Calvary but he must come back into his own gate of his own City and be able to take now the book and let there be Witnesses now according to Jewish law there had to be at least 10 but he wanted to double that times four and then he would have 24 Witnesses 12 from the Old Testament 12 from the new and there they were in theophanic appearance and they stood there when he walks up before the Throne of God and takes the book and then everybody starts falling down and worshiping God and praising God blessed art thou because thou has redeemed us to God by thy blood and out of every Kindred and tongue and nation and people and thou Hast made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth what are they doing they're having this great time of rejoicing in the gate of the city just like they did with Boaz so when Boaz comes up and takes the price and he exchanges the currency over to Toad and to admits it and to has to go ahead and take his shoe off and hand it over to Boaz and as a said sometimes it would just be the seller doing it sometimes it would be the seller and the buyer and whenever he took his shoe off that signified I will no more set my foot on your property that's exactly what we need to tell the devil tonight too the devil bothering you with high blood pressure the devil bothering you with back pain or kidney stones or whatever it is you're going through you need to remind the Devil he's one barefooted devil and he better not be walking on your property because you'll have spiked Nails stuck up on the perimeter so devil if you want to come on come on come on if you want to walk out our property but remember you're barefooted and we're going to remind you you're walking on our property and our signs are posted everywhere no trespassing and we have fouly in the court of God's Judiciary and if we get sick and if I ain't got enough Faith to make this thing leave me I'm going to go before the Elders of the church and they're going to pray for me and they're going to set me free by the power of God oh you say brother Donny that's a big mouthful it is and let me add another mouthful with it the prophet said the army of the devil put sickness on you and the army of God takes it off we're not here to play with the devil we're not here to play church I don't know about you tonight I've come to have real church I've come to lay hands on the sick I've come to lay hands on those that are bound and watch them walk up here bound but watch them walk away free by the power of God why because it was settled in the gate of the city our Boaz went Before the Throne of God and took the book of our inheritance and the elders in heaven fell down before him and said Thou Art Worthy thou are worthy I'll say the same thing tonight he is worthy he is worthy oh Hallelujah that I've got everything I need right now in my soul for the rest of my journey for however long I live woo hallelujah hallelujah now watch this I love the way the goes into this about the life and the blood Rebecca and Isaac were blood relation cousins oh my and the Bride of Jesus Christ is blood relation to him a blood bought bride now you see this is another thing theologically where we differ with most of Christendom in the day that we live in that we know there was not enough chemistry in the body of the Lord Jesus always shed one drop for me and how is that impossible how is that possible rather there was not enough chemistry in his body to shed one drop that's the carnal mind that looks at still the natural side of the chemistry and the blood was so important but the cken is not the blood oh I know there's message preachers that preach contrary to that but the message preachers are wrong they're not preaching the message that's the problem they're not preaching the message the prophet tells us it was thought to be the chemistry of the blood but when the blood cell broke open it released what more chemistry the life the to token life the token life of God so all it would have been necessary my friends was for him to shed one drop of blood he didn't even have to shed out all the pints of blood that was in his body how many ever was there all he needed to do was one blood cell to be broke open that's where life started don't you understand it didn't start with five pints in Mary's womb it started with one cell when God created himself Lord have mercy when God created himself in a virgin womb you imagine he spoke and he followed the trajectory of his own word and he himself got inside her womb by the spoken word and it started from one blood cell which did not come from Mary and did not come from Joseph but it come from himself he deposited in a human bank that which would be necessary to pay the price for our sins Hallelujah if he would have shed one drop of blood only one drop that would have been enough power in that one drop to save all the billions of people that live on the face of the Earth if that accept it amen and when the blood cell started there then it was broke at Calvary what did it release Zoe so out of that tiny tiny droplet of his blood was released the godhead you don't see it yet no no you don't one day you will it'll turn you inside out when you do the word Theos Theos which is a Greek word for deity the godhead yeah I'll wait on that but once you see there's a part of God in you that was there before there was any molecules or time that's the redeemable part notice he says the life is in the blood and the life is in the church the Christian that's born again by the spirit of God that's the spirit of Life blood relation to Christ and the spirit of Christ is the blood of Christ leading a child of Christ The Seed of Abraham that's why they move peculiarly well Glory that's why the world think so strange of them so don't just think it's you uh-uh it's the blood of Jesus your blood relation to God Lord willing Sunday I want to speak to you on another right that God's give you like a little Prelude on it it's the right to be married to God thank you Lord it's as far as I'm going with it so don't try to pull it out of me but before he can make this transaction remember he want wants a legal marriage her husband is dead but there's still a claim on her she still has no inheritance and she's still going by that tile moabitas moabitas she needs to be changed from Roost the moabitas to roost the wife with boas amen if he can buy her and release her at the Gate of his City he will change her name forever notice this the prophet said he's absolutely legal defeated in every place now remember to's ride had to be forfeited and the Devil's right's got to be forfeited with a claim on you and I the devil hasn't got one legal right at all nowhere I want you to listen now of this guy that goes around blows around blows around you know and he Huffs and he Puffs and he said I'm going to blow your house down and he blows and he Huffs and he Puffs and he's going to blow your house down but what you need to do is drag out your double gauge and say you puff one more time and I'm going to blow you away I've got double barrel was the Old Testament and the New Testament put together and I know how to use this thing so I'm giving you a warning oh you say Brother Don that sounds pretty far out it ain't far out at all the Bible tells us that if we'll submit oursel to God the devil will flee from us I think you know what it's time that we to go to reverse some of this fle instead of us running from the devil and the devil Boo and we jump back Boo and we jump back scared to death what in the world is the matter with us it ought to be us booing the devil it ought to be a boo devil boo high blood pressure boo you o toy and back thing boo get out of my way you ain't stopping me this is not who I am this is only a temporary setback I wasn't born to be a creature of time I was not born to remain sick I I Hallelujah to God I was not born to be down I was not born to be S I was born to be a Son of God I was born to have joy unspeakable fall and full of Glory in this life not the [Applause] Millennium the devil hasn't got one legal right at all nowhere he's just a devil he's just a devil and the password I find that so unusual a password that's all he hasn't got no legal right to any man that'll accept the promise of Jesus Christ he's whipped oh Hallelujah yes sir he's whipped in sickness he's whipped in disappointments he's whipped in everything he's whipped in death come on somebody he's whipped in death he can't scare me he can't scare you and that's all he is is a big old Shadow a big old Shadow now let me show you tonight there's only one way way that Satan has got any legal right against you only one way as long as he's got an unconfessed sin something that you ought to have done or ought not have done you could anoint him with oil you can do anything you wish to he will not leave that's right he has a legal right to hold there this is the only way friends that Satan will not move if there's something in our life we should have done something in our life we shouldn't have done I can pray for you brother the D can pray for you every man of God can pray for you anoint you we can do all that we can jump and Shout around you we can March around Jericho Till There is no Jericho but he knows his rights on and he knows if there's any unconfessed sin and we're coming up for prayer he'll s right there and he'll laugh in my face while I'm praying for you he'll life in your face but if we can make everything right it'll be us doing the life now remember this is from a servant of God who cast out Devils by the thousands the fourth dimension was a realm that we knew very little about God sent prophets in different areas and they were like a window to the supernatural so it was like the wall into the fourth dimension would be like this we could see nothing we don't know if it's wide outside dark outside cars passing by we don't know we can't see anything but then every now then God would send a prophet and he would cut a hole out and God would place a prophetic gift in that wall of time and then we could look through the wall and say oh my oh look that look look at that look oh my oh wow oh oh my and then God would take that Prophet from the earth and the wall would go solid again then didn't send another and another and another but in the last days for whatever reason I mean God cut a picture window and kicked it out and exposed the devil and hear them Devils was they were being seen for the first time since to fall in the Garden of Eden the way they were showed now when Jesus so here he give us a little bit of you but for whatever reason God chose the last days he's going to expose that devil can you imagine a man standing in the platform and he hears these demons as they're talking he hears them as they are screaming can't you hear them he says they're saying keep them from believing keep them from believing so he are these demons in the fourth dimension faith is building in the service and he's sharing this conflict going on I said the angels of God are here and the demons are here and there's a great Warfare going on he said how will it end it will depend on what you believe so for the first time this big piece of glass opened up and we've got a a human being standing there said can you see that can you see that streak it went from this woman here on the platform that man back there the same thing it's a cancer he's screaming help me help me I've often wondering when them demons got back in hell that one that told on the other they must had the office fight ever was can you imagine they got down I said what in the work you do that for I was HD I thought I was head pretty good you I remember Hell is offest mess ever was remember what hell is built on division contention can you imagine what it's like in hell well look around here and you get a pretty good idea except it's a lot worse down there but imagine how can there ever be a kingdom so whether it's a kingdom a family or church or whatever it is and it's built upon splitting like like heaven was or it's built upon the personality of of another monarchy that wants to have a great trone and you imagine down there the darkness and the fussing the prophet said what causes war in the world is because those Spirits so the spirit of Russia hates the spirit of America and it's evident that the spirit of a lot of those in the UN hates the spirit on Israel come on somebody and they cannot stand that Spirit on Israel and they get jealous of one another and they hate one another and and for the first time since man had stepped out of the Garden of Eden were able to peer into that realm and hear what they're saying and the prophet said he'd go back to the motel room at night and your chains rattling all night long and them demons would come into his hotel room and their flesh would rub his flesh I don't mind telling you I'm glad I ain't made to deal with that sort of thing I wouldn't have to worry about too much of it cuz I'd pass out cold in the wedge I'd wake up sometime in the morning and say what happened what happened aren't you glad you don't Oh Brother Don I'm terrified I'm terrified don't tell me that don't worry God will never let you deal with what you cannot deal with but what did God do he put this big gigantic picture window but he didn't just let us go to see hell but as he was sitting in his bed and he kind of raised up and put his hands behind his bed thinking of that song I am Lonesome oh so lonesome like to look past the curtain of time would you like to see oh yes I believe it but help me so much and all of a sudden I felt myself leing my body and I looked over at my wife and I looked up above myself and there I was about 20 feet from my body and I looked and here come all of these people running it looked like millions of them and the sisters was the ones that got to him first all of them was that long beautiful hair hanging down their back long robes on screaming our precious brother our precious brother then Here Come Those young men long shaggy hair wow and they were screaming our precious brother our precious brother and they reached down and pick me up and set me up kind of high said why'd you do that you as a leader in life oh I I want to see Jesus me and Carol was telling about this week she said I wonder what what Erica and all them saints are up there doing I said I don't know honey I don't I don't know it's not like they have a schedule it's not like they have events that they have to attend and go to I said but can you imagine Carol what a place that sixth Dimension must be that it is a place of such happiness and Bliss that he said if I've died I want to see Jesus and the voice answered and said you can't see him now he's a little bit higher and that took care of it wow I mean you'd think you'd be so sad and so lonely I want to see Jesus I want to see Jesus but it's not that sixth Dimension has its own Comforts and he still a seen Jesus yet but he went to finding trying to find adjectives to describe the place and he said perfect million miles beyond that Sublime be beyond that I don't know if a word in the English language he said that would describe it other than you've arrived wonder why of all the I Paul was carried up I knew a man about 14 years ago when they're in the body they're out of the body I cannot tell but such a one was carried up into the third heavens and heard things that was not lawful for a man to utter so what it was that Paul experienced he couldn't even come back and tell his people why his time was not the Rapture age but God let our messenger one go over and be able to come back with some grapes amen praise the Lord come back and say I'll never be the same brother brandom again again I'll never be the same one and Not only was he able to peer into that realm and see all of that but also break into the Angelic realm not just the angels of God like Gabriel and W woodworm and all of those but your angel cuz you remember when he come back down and a few years after that translation in 1960 he said I was able to look over there that morning and I saw all of you all there that's why I feel so sorry for those who have took a stand against this message I feel so sorry for them may God help them to come back and realize no doubt some's cross the line you and I don't know who that is you got family members there pray for them that God God will help them to come to their senses think what God did to open up that sphere and be able to watch these demons and see them as he tells us in the church age book whenever he would go to Discerning and the spirit of God would move upon him and he would watch the countenance of their face change because he said Satan is afraid you see we never knew that he said Satan is afraid to be exposed and he said that will reflect on the countenance of the people so they'll go to acting really funny and behaving funny because that Spirit that's dominating their life or their faith or their body it'll become so apprehensive and so tore up and here what was it a window end the supernatural oh but how would he tell oh you're a Christian I know you're a Christian say okay now your higher sister is 28 Ines down from the crown up here down and I see that your high heels is under 2 Ines so you're good there and I see your dresses Y come on down past the the out about 3 in yeah you're good okay that wouldn't way tell him that's Christians but he said I see you're a Christian because it's light around you so he was reading demons he was reading Angels he was reading Christians by what pulsations of light or Darkness you see every one of us have an appearance every one of us have a story that story of your life is not just your mortality it is whether you are light or Darkness I want you to listen to this but I in your command tonight I come to represent your vicarious suffering as talking to the Lord Lord in prayer I in your command tonight I come to represent your vicarious suffering and death at Calvary who stripped and robbed Satan of every legal right he had he is only a bluff amen amen and he's exposed tonight amen can't you understand friends why he hates this message why is it that this message is hated so much it's unbelievable the small amount of percentage of the people on the Earth that even believe it and accept it why don't the infidels and the unbelievers and many of those that have turned and walked away why don't they fight the Bible the way they fight the message why don't they fight Catholicism which is killed millions of people right have y'all ever heard me teach you how to kill anybody have we ever martyred anyone here at our church do we do what the denominations has done why is this message hated so much because Satan knows if he can stop the men of God from preaching the message of the hour oh I know some of our compromising so-called message preachers they're reverting back to preaching the same Bible stories that's been preached for decades uhhuh and I'd like to remind you them same Bible stories preached under the light of the day gone by never did produce a Rapture and it won't produce one now unless we preach some same Bible stories under the anointing of Malachi 4 then we preach Daniel and the Lion's then it's under a different anointing we preach some of the same Bible stories Harry but we're preaching it under the anointing of Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10 and it will Usher in a change of the body because the anointing has changed it's no wonder Satan don't want the message preached pardon me just an update you'll never stop it never and Boaz the king of the Harvest the lord of the Harvest goes outside the gates calls the Elders of the city and makes a public testimony outside the gate all of you people took off a shoe and kicked it off before them at a testimony and said I this day have redeemed all of Naomi's lost Heritage and all of her possessions is mine this day let me just say it our government may turn against Israel and they will France may turn against Israel Britain may turn against Israel turkey has already cut off relations with them the UAE Saudi Arabia Egypt different ones of them are making threats And if every nation under Heaven turns against her who are they compared to he who rides on a white horse wo Oh Glory I'm talking about the Prince of Peace the bright and The Morning Star you see my King has power to split mountains my king Iran you know they think they got really really smart because they divided their nuclear capabilities and they've got part of them buried under this mountain in Iran and part of them buried under that mountain in Iran and this mountain in Iran and America is the only one that has a bomb that they think can even halfway penetrate that mountain and that is one that whenever they drop it it does not explode whenever it hits the ground but it actually goes and buries itself down in the mountain and then after it's down in there for how many ever hundreds of feet then it will explode and they hope that it will take care of Iran's nuclear stud but let me tell you one thing I ain't a hoping tonight I ain't a hoping that my Jesus has got enough power I've done red in the back of the Bible in the Book of Revelation I've done read at the end of the prophecy of the Old Testament I found where Zachariah said that he will stand there upon that mountain and when he does it will split and hide and you will run to me as you did in the days of AEL it will make a valley down through there and the king of kings and Lord Lords will come to get whever of them's alive of that 144,000 and he will stand there and all the bombs of the world won't stop it all the f35s and the F-22 and the machine guns and the Hand Grenade cuz you can't kill my Jesus no more the price has done been paid but once he paid the price he got back into the righteous form Hallelujah he entered back into the deity before and you better look out devil cuz he told John I am he that was dead but I am alive forever more I was dead but I won't die again I am the resurrection I am the life I am the Healer I'm the alpha Oh Glory to God I am the Omega I'm talking about your husband or says about 30 oh I just feel something moving he says notice Christ before the Elders of Israel LED outside the gates watch him now the purchase price was paid outside the gates made a testimony wounded for our transgressions whether stripes are healed a public testimony he redeemed the church from what a lost estate and the Garden of Eden we didn't have any sickness the Garden of Eden we had no sin the Garden of Eden we had no death God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son and made a testimony outside the gate but let me just give you a little heads up for Sunday he was the only begotten son but he's not the only one now Hallelujah glory to God glory to God he redeemed man to everything he lost in the fall Christ restored it to him in the Kinsman redeemers ship when he died at Calvary your health your eternal life life everything you lost in the fall Christ redeems you to it he's your kinsman redeemer you with me yeah your health amen your strengths and everything you lost belongs back to you tonight through the Lord Jesus he became kin folk to take away sin and sickness he redeemed her back everything she had plucked off his shoe and made a public inside that all that come in and out might know that he had redeemed everything na only lost and he was in full possession what did Jesus do to do it he made a public testimony when Satan could not die for sins because he was The Sinner he's the father of sin but Jesus the innocent one God Of Heaven who didn't have to die come down and made a public testimony by dying lifted up between the heavens and the earth a public testimony stripped his clothes off of him and hung between the heavens and the Earth in shame and died a sinful shameful deaths can't you see why he couldn't take the book of Redemption on the cross he died the death of a sinner he had to wait till he was righteous again what did he do kicked off his own righteousness kicked off his own glory Lord have mercy and he asked you to give up cigarettes he asked you to give up something worldly and ungodly and we belly at and cry like it's something terrible can you imagine becoming from God it would have been what a transition to be come from God to man yes sir but to come from God to be a sinner I have power I could speak to my father and straight way had send me 20 Legions of angels but he kicked that off he laid God aside he laid aside all of his dignity everything aside and become a sinner and died for you and I you see how Satan here in the scripture tried to make him break God's plan to receive it give it to him when he took him up on the mountain and tried to give it to him without the purchase of the blood you want the Earth fine I own it you don't have to die a kingdom without a cal remember I preached that to you 32 years ago you don't have to die you want it I'll give it to you I'll gladly give it to you no Calvary no dying no cross no Thorns none of that none of that totally Escape every bit of it just bow to me and worship me that's all you got to do I'll give it to you oh but remember he was the word without the purchase of the blood notice Matthew for it again the devil taketh him into an exceeding high mountain can you imagine the devil having such power that by time travel he would be able to pick up the Lord Jesus from where he was and move it when the prophet reads this in the seal book he says what a creature and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and sayth unto him all these things will I give this that will fall down and worship me you imagine showed him all the kingdoms of world not the ghettos not the back alleys the Palaces the fine homes you want it no problem I'll give it to you I'll make a trade why cuz Satan wants to be worshiped so bad and there's nobody who wants to worship it any more than Theos deity don't you understand one child of God would mean more to him if they would bow on their knee and worship him than all of his own children because they are like him but if one son of God or one daughter of God will say Satan you're King you're God you're the great Creator he would have broke into to what he could never get to the godhead but don't hold your breath devil too long CU ain't none of them Theos kids ever going to do that then Jesus saith unto him get thee hence Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve let me close you a momentarily bit I want you to think of this before we close the Lord Jesus and raising Lazarus and those others in the New Testament that actually had died and he raised them from the dead but every one of them had to die again because even though they experienced a bodily resurrection that did not redeem them permanently from The Sting of death don't you understand tonight you're more blessed than Lazarus was if your soul has raised from the dead it can never die again the resurrection a resurrection from the dead that's phenomenal it's wonderful yes it is but a resurrection from the dead is not a full Redemption what happened to all them people that died in the New Testament raising from them dead every one of them died again what A peculiar feeling it must have been for Lazarus he died twice What A peculiar feeling it must have been for the Widow of name with her son and you know all these people that that that he raised in the dead so they done face death one thing he's raised up by them but because he did not redeem them from the curse of the law they had to face death twice but if you're sting here tonight with the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul you can never die oh but you say brother Donnie sister Erica died oh no she did not brother Donnie brother Jerry Phillips oh no he did not the coat that he lived in passed away the coat that Erica lived in passed away but Erica is alive and well she's more alive than she's everwhere brother Jim bad brother Jerry Phillips sister Naomi on and on and on we can name them here tonight they are not dead they are alive Hallelujah and can never never die again think of it as powerful as a resurrection is do you understand that people could get miracles in their body that don't mean that they'll have eternal life people could get healed in their body and still wind up being lost but if you're standing here tonight and your soul has been redeemed praise God that is the greatest of all miracles amen oh my don't you appreciate the Lord Jesus tonight amen let me read you this in the future home and then we'll close did you notice how Abraham when they tried to give him the land and he bought it with so many shekels of silver before the people as an inside as a witness let it be known this day I bought this bearing Place see purchase it Satan tried to give him the Lord Jesus the kingdom which belongs to him now he tried to give it to him as a gift you see the devil would love to give you as a gift to God as long as God don't fill you with the Holy Ghost God you want Jonathan you want Kirk you want Donnie you want all these women but sure you can have them sure I don't mind letting you have them they want to go to church fine let them get a religious par that's fine have no problem with that but God don't you get in them don't you get in them if you break that blood cell over their soul and you go in them God my chains are forever broken where would we be tonight were it not for his grace amen a hopeless case yeah I'm looking at hundreds of them here tonight let me finish this quote he tried to give it to him as a gift but he wouldn't receive it because see then Satan could still have a claim on it but it had to be bought that's why he wants to clear your deed Ruth to where you're released from the nature now remember when mean married her under the first nature in the type he married her as a moabitas which would have kept her out of the economy of God but she must be remarried to another man to be brought in to the tribes of Israel and that's why you must be be remarried again to another nature thank you Lord when you were born you was given a human name to that first nature and everything you done under that first nature was listed under that first name like ru some more about this go to church do all them good things but you don't get a new name just because you join church you've got to have another marriage so there's got to be a death to your first husband you see Boaz could not marry as long as Mayon was alive so her first husband had to be dead and if she could marry a prince in the land Maybe could not stand in the gates of the city he alienated himself across the border in the land of Moab Adam couldn't redeem us Moses couldn't take us back but there had to be a goel that was still in the land of inheritance and from the land itself he would project his love I find it to be amazing because historically they say that she was probably in her 30s and Boaz was in his 80s so that young woman married the Ancient of Days amen one of our brothers standing here tonight had a dream a while back about that Dimension he saw several people there saw brother Jim Babs he come running up to him he saw brother Cecil but it took him a little bit to recognize brother Cecil because him and brother Jimmy were the same age [Laughter] then in a little bit he saw Erica coming she come running and hollering to him praise the Lord after the visitation there and brother Jim bab took him and also Eric on the other side and telling them now you got to go back you got to go back friends they are alive tonight [Music] amen they are alive but they white nose don't you want to go hallelujah oh Jesus thank you you suffered without the gate to pay the price of redemption but thank you so much for going up before father God and offering your blood as the atonement by which we are redeemed Lord Jesus thank you Father we stand here tonight with gratitude in our hearts where would I be Lord where would we all be tonight no telling where I'd be if it wasn't for your grace be I turned Pentecost still running around preaching this that the other but your grace not only come to save me but you gave me more grace as you kept revealing your word thank you for this message of the end time I love it now more than I ever have I'm so grateful for it Lord dear Jesus we worship you tonight come Lord come for your Ru oh how nervous you must have been at the house waiting not sure what the outcome would be cuz she wasn't actually there before the elders when the transaction took place so to and made his claim and it seemed as if to had the upper hand but the Lord Jesus was not done yet oh what a day it must have been an awesome hour when her and Naomi got the message from the gate Boaz made the deal baz paid the price Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord Jesus we're waiting for that beckoning call for us to also be summoned up to the gate when we too hallelujah hallelujah your Prophet tells us something at shreport that he knows that we'll be looking around in that Resurrection so he lets us get get together first we'll be looking around to see if this one made it that one made it Carol asked me the other day how would that be how how could we if we didn't find our loved ones How Could That Be Heaven I said well I certainly don't have all the answers but I I don't see how we could enter into a marriage supper of the Lamb thinking a uncle didn't make it a sister didn't make it a niece didn't make it somehow he will erase that from our memory how could we enjoy eternity with that hanging over us but we'll all gather together I'm reminder of the dream that brother Ron Peterson had years ago and he was balling and crying like a baby when he told me about it he and I sitting there together and he said it's like the Resurrection The Rapture took place and the Lord Jesus was in the middle of all this throng of people and we all started worshiping and praising his name and the more we worshiped he started rising up out of that crowd and the more we praised the higher you Rose and the more we praise the higher you Rose and you Rose to where you were suspended in the heavens above us millions of us were praising and adoring Ing and worshiping you Lord Jesus I don't want to wait to that hour I want to do that every day of my life I want to lift you no telling how many people have used your name in vain today don't even believe in you and made fun of you but I'm here tonight to lift you and worship you and adore you Lord Jesus we worship you father he could we sing that song where would I be maybe Ruth sitting back at home not knowing will I be an outcast will to assert his claim upon me will I wind up being to's wife will I wind up being in another Loveless marriage oh Hallelujah our first husband that we were married to we were truly in a Loveless marriage Hallelujah but we sure can't say that now Lord Oh Praise the Lord we worship you Jesus can we just love him a little bit before we go I know you got to work tomorrow and you got school and on and on and on all that stuff but let's just cut our time fellowshipping out there a little bit and let's just fellowship with him a little bit right now sing it for S let's just worship him together where would I [Music] be you only know oh Hallelujah Lord Jesus you see I'm glad you see through
