piece i've come to know though my heart and flesh may fail there's an anchor for my soul i can say it is has overcome and the grave is overwhelmed the victory is one he has risen from the dead and i

name no more sorrow no more pain i will rise eagle's wings before my god fall on my knees and rise will rise i will rise [Music] will test one two work better when you've got them on nothing let's turn today if you would to uh genesis chapter 5 verse 21. i certainly want to wish all of our mothers happy mother's day certainly shouldn't be the only day in the week that they get an acknowledgement i if we really understood the position of a godly mother and what a mother can do do you realize just that one principle could turn this entire nation around if real women really stood on principles and the real mothers not just preachers and deacons and trustees with just real real mothers and be their their position of what god wants them to be genesis chapter 5 verse 21 i wish to speak to you today on enoch the stone basin enoch the stone mason in enoch lived sixty and five years and begat mesouza and ian locke walked with god after he began the service of 300 years and begat sons and daughters all the days of enoch were 360 and five years and enoch walked with god and he was not for god took him let's bow our heads together lord jesus we thank you today for your word we so appreciate the opportunity again that we can come together to assemble in your presence realizing lord that we are a privileged people that have been called unto you we know it's not through our own goodness any merits that we would be able to accomplish or achieve we ask your help your guidance your blessings on the service today lord we don't want it to be a protractive meeting of a gathering together and we show some new clothes that bought or talk about a new business deal that we made this week but we desire to receive something out of the service that will make us more like you people that are more surrendered to your will or consecrated help us today father may you take your word and speak to us anoint me lord but anoint the people as well in jesus christ and we pray amen and the saint said god bless you may be seated i'd like to read i think we read this last sunday but i'd like to read it to you again in verse 24 and enoch walked with god and he was not for god took him and the word took is to take get fetch lay hold of seas marry take a wife take possession of we know that god in writing the bible he had many things that was written out very plain and very simple and yet there was other things that was written in such a way that the average person could just pick it up like reading a newspaper and totally understand everything that god wanted to do god had his plan his program written down through the ages and he hid it many times in symbols jesus actually thanked the father that he had done it this way when he was here which might seem peculiar to us because we'd think why in the world would jesus thank god that he had hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent but yet that's part of god's character and we must take it that it's that way i want you to notice this an infallibility of god's spoken word but the realm says enoch enoch before the world the anti-living destruction if he wanted to show a type how could he do it he didn't want enoch to die he had to make a translation for him he had to make a translation for him god had to do it in order to make a type out of enoch now there was no written bible of course at this time so god wanted to take this man's life and write a type out of his life but enoch was living in a in in quite a terrible day as far as the condition of the world but yet the scripture tells us in hebrews chapter 11 verse 5 by faith enoch was translated which means to remove or change to transpose two things one of which is put in the place of another to transfer to change to go or pass over so enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god now we know that enoch walked with god as the bible tells us here but we know also the bible says that noah walked was god there were different people that the bible actually uses his term that they walked with god but we know that there are walks of degrees by which a person can walk with god and in the light that they're walking they can please god to all that they know but enoch walked with god in a degree that noah could not touch or many of the other people that have lived down through time but enoch wasn't just a passive sort of fellow that just lived his own type of life and never really bothered anybody and you know he just believed things it was kind of different and peculiar and everybody just knew it was different it was kind of a hermit type of a guy everybody just left him alone enoch was a man that was a very different sort of a man now he was a man who prophesied in a two-fold way prophesied of the coming judgment of god and he prophesied of the coming of the saints with the lord but yet enoch was also a man that understood many many things about the heavenlies he was a man that understood many things about the earth about the moon about the sun about geometry about algebra he understood many things about the principles of life and the principles of god and how it all tied together now he was not just a man that was going to be charged with being a type to leave this world but committed to this man was going to be something totally different that had never been done before and that the word of god would be translated from thoughts of god those things which was on god's heart it would actually be translated and become visible into a structural form now this man is going to be totally different than noah would be is going to be totally different than any other man that's ever been on the earth committed to his charge is going to take the bible and to be able to put the bible in the second manifested form that god would have it upon the earth now you're already looking at my story odd now listen whenever whenever god wanted to relate it this way notice how brother brahman says it the first bible that was ever written was written in the skies and the zodiac starts off with the virgin i come first ends up with leo line the second coming he's writing his first bible the second bible was written was written by enoch and put in the pyramid so it was written by enoch so how what does that mean so it means that that enoch actually rewrote the bible and put it on skins or something like that and stuffed it in a corn over here and a corn over there and one over here and buried so much over it over here that was not what enoch was actually doing but enoch is going to convey the mystery of redemption the mystery of the bride the mystery of the king the mystery of the seven steps going up to the king's chamber the ark of degree all these different things he's going to hide the mystery of all of that in the measurements of this great great building that is going to stand there which was built before the flood it has been a memorial it withstood the flood it was stood many things has come upon the earth napoleon looked at the same thing moses saw the great pyramid napoleon come and stood as he looked turned at his scientists to try to come and understand it many great british scientists many scientists from all over the world have tried to understand it yet within it contains the bible it's not just a laboratory it's not just a place of scientific research but it's a place which holds the mysteries of god right the second bible was written he says was written by enoch and put in the pyramid the third bible was written the last one which is this one brother brown indicates his bible he passed it god always does things in threes god is perfect in threes he's perfect in father son and holy spirit he's perfect in justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost he's perfected in threes we are in his making so we are perfected in three soul body and spirit are bodies controlled of nerves blood and of cells three all perfected in the three so we're all perfected in three so god had three bibles the first one of course was written in the stars and then the second one god was now coming to some sort of a dispensational change by which he's showing his program on the earth so he deals with a man which is a prophet this man will be able to lay out the geometric designs inside this pyramid the various shape the place that will be on the earth the location on the earth the size it will be the pyramid cubit the pyramid inches the all these things that's inside of that will convey a story of god and a sort of redemption now we know that god cannot write one bible and it'd say one thing write a second bible and say another and write a third bible and let's say another they've all three got to say the same thing then when those bibles are then expressed it will live out saying the same thing that what's been written wouldn't it be exactly the same thing so then god had something in his mind look at this in the ark in 1955 he said the great pyramid that enoch built the last chamber has gone through ready for the king's chamber now he said the coming of the lord right in the top of the keystone and all the calendar of astronomy points right straight the stars are declaring it as they did the first time now watch this again an adoption he says i've often made this remark and said god made three bibles the first one he put it in the sky the zodiac did you ever see the zodiac what's the first figure in the zodiac the virgin when the last figure is the zodiac leo the lion he come the first time through the virgin and the second time is the line of the tribe of judah he made the next one in the pyramid back in the days of enoch when they made the pyramid they measure them i don't understand it but to the wars where they stoop on their knees for so long and can measure the distance of wars you know where they measure to now plumb across the king's chamber now this is not just a tomb that some of you think well it's just a tomb for the the pharaohs of egypt and it was actually built by the egyptians and it was actually uh you know it was really nothing to do with enoch it was nothing to do with us no no no my friend you are totally wrong as a matter of fact it has been proven over and over again the egyptians at this time of the world's history were not as advanced to even understand geometry this was not made under the council of the egyptians the egyptians 1 000 years after the flood still did not understand pie and square and all of that because they are the descendants of ham he is the father of egypt but this was built under the inspiration of someone who understood the heavenlies as a matter of fact this man understood it so close that he caught the degree of the ark of the earth the curvature of the earth and embedded that secret inside the chambers of the great pyramid so there must be a significance to you and if it's the second bible now what kind of christian would i think you would be if you said i don't need the bible i don't even care about it i think there's something wrong with you well it'd be the same attitude toward the stars and be the same attitude toward the pyramid then because there's something in there that it holds a great great thing for us as the people of god so we'd like to look at the lord but help us to end some of the points about the pyramid i realize some of it will be just knowledge and some of it you won't remember till you drive through wendy's and get you all frosty and it won't mean no more to you than nothing but yet for a little bit you just try to listen and maybe you'll be able to get get some understanding of it the great pyramids i decided to put this up where you could read if you'd like to read along with me the great pyramid sets in the center of gravity of the continents it lies in the exact center of all the land area of the world now notice where this lays it lays in the center of the continents in the center of the gravity of the continents in the exact center of all the land area of the world dividing the earth's land mass into approximately four quarters the north-south axis 31 degrees east of greenwood's is the longest land meridian east-west axis 30 degrees north is the longest land parallel on the globe there's obviously only one place at the longest land lines of the terrestrial earth can cross it is at the great pyramid now notice then so all these land lines the four corners of the earth they would all cross and the pyramid sets right in the middle of where they cross so where they cross is a story to be understood in the cross now you think then that they just went out there and enoch you know just eeny meeny miny moe where this rock throws is where i will go you think he just said some kind of rhyme i'm gonna throw this over my back and wherever it goes i'm gonna throw it and we'll we'll build this great big peculiar uh that ain't the way my daddy does things the average height of land sea level miami being the low the himalayas being the high can be measured only by modern day satellites and computers happens to be the same as the height of the pyramid so we'd take the low and we would take the high and then we would find the middle part of that the average line height then it just so happens that that the great pyramid now not all the other pyramids the state pyramids ones and shell in the andes and all that but the great pyramid is that average height of how this works now watch also the curvature designed in the faces of the pyramid exactly matches the radius of the earth not known until modern day technology was available [Applause] unless of course you're talking to the man who made it [Applause] he's always ahead of radar you see [Music] [Laughter] the measurement used by the builders the pyramid cubit when divided into the base length of the great pyramid is 365.242 pyramid cubits precisely the number of days in one year a line drawn on a map from the apex of the pyramid to bethlehem the angle of the ascending passage and crosses the red sea and most likely the point where the israelites cross departing egypt i love reading stuff like this it just makes me know how big my father really is [Laughter] a line drawn on a map from the south from the apex of the pyramid at the angle of the ascending passage crosses mount sinai [Applause] the orientation of the great pyramid is within three quarters of an inch of true north a modern magnetic compass is usually far less accurate so there must have been a man on the earth now you realize there's different theories and different opinions of what what happened this some folks actually think that it was ufos that come to the earth and there was aliens and it was all kinds of other things that that dropped down this you know but aren't you glad we have a message that lets us know who it actually was but then you think why would god go to all of this trouble and cause man to go to all of this labor and to be able to maintain such a structure it must have had such value to god that god would allow it to be built in such a way being the only living or the only remaining i should say the only remaining saying of the seven wonders of the ancient world praise the lord glory the ancient egyptians called it the pillar of enoch now i find this very peculiar since enoch was not an egyptian why would they call one of their pride and joys supposedly a pillar of enoch why is it that it does not show on the hieroglyphics and the pictures and all that does not show egyptians building it why is it that there's no affinity in the workmanship or the labor or the craftsmen or the artisans being egyptians who designed and brought such a thing very simple it wasn't egyptians just like it wasn't baptist who designed salvation it wasn't pentecostals it wasn't me and you it was a great designer he's the one who designed salvation he's the one who made the rapture then he ought to know how to get in it amen gloria notice this i found this very interesting one man who measured and studied the great pyramid was a structural engineer by the name of david davidson early in the last century this agnostic set his mind to disprove all the pyramid theories you know all the different things that people are saying well it means this it means that something to do with god when he completed his task his conclusion was that the pyramid was truth in structural form pretty good for an unbeliever [Applause] do you understand friend that that's what the real body of christ is it's truth in structural form can't you see why that the word the message of the hour must be more than brother brahma said brother man said brother brandon said brother man said it must be the truth instructional form in the way we live and the way we walk and the way we move what is that that is truth that is being translated into structural form and behavior oh thank you lord jesus truth and structural form that it established the bible as the inspired work of god how in the world could you ever come up with that idea did he go in and find matthew mark luke and john axe first and second corinthians did he find that road all over the wall no he found it by using a measuring tape algebra geometry he found god in that pyramid by seeing measurements and scale and time oh thank you jesus the great pyramid has been called the bible in stone upon this rock i will build my church so we know then that the pyramid is not just a pile of rocks right now a carpenter might be able to lay some stone brother dave's a good carpenter and other brothers that are carpenter and no doubt they can lay some stone but there's a difference in a carpenter who can lay a little stone and a stone base now they made it much easier in this day to lay stone being cultured and all that where they come with pretty simple directions and you can stick it here and do this and do that in the other that doesn't really require the ability though of a stone mason now many men are suitable for preachers of religion in this modern day but it takes a real stonemason to build children into a house of god to make them constituents for a rapture glory to god hallelujah i'll tell friends we don't need some preachers you know that's just builders and can stick a little stone here and stick a little stone there and stick a little something on the outside we need some men of god to handle that word that's able to take that word and shape us into the house of the living god but where did this man get this design the blue princess would say where did this design come from since they did not understand geometry since they did not understand pie since they did not understand many of these principles at this time of civilization where did this man come from with these understandings notice this the great pyramid has been called the bible in stone because it's passageways and chambers revealed geometrically inline and symbol the profound spiritual truths of the plan of salvation silent geometry reveals a remarkable witness the slope of the walls of the pyramid being the same slope of the curvature of the earth [Music] and enoch was not part of the shuttle crew they had no shadows so how was he able to get outside the earth and look at that and measure that degree well he didn't need to he just took the main designer's word for it [Applause] notice this now on the inside your brother's got the picture ready and the way that this thing is made now there's many different angles and pictures and drawings of course that you're able to get on the internet in different places as far as studying it but i want you to look that down on the very bottom of this thing down underneath the pyramid a place there called the pit glory to god if i don't have a spell i ain't gonna understand why oh thank you lord jesus then there is an ascending passage now notice how it's coming up down in the pit then there is what is called the ascending passage now notice coming up from out of the pit before you get to the king's chamber there is another little smaller chamber there called the queen's chamber now remember this is the bible in stone [Applause] hallelujah to god you come up out of the pit now notice this is our lord's descent this is not our lord's burying place this is our lord's conquering memorial hallelujah they want me to embalm his body they won't need to bury him in there it has withstood the flood it withstood napoleon's conquest of hebrew it withstood alexander ptolemy it was not other why because god purposed it soul [Applause] i want you to notice these little half marks as they come out through their passageways little tiny passageways and look at where they wind up aiming to you got two that goes from the queen's chamber hitting the star sirius and quahog from the king's chamber of rhymes belt alpha draco now look at the lights the sheer from the queen's chamber lights from the stars little tiny passageways so small that a man cannot crawl through it that they have to send a remote controlled robot to be able to go down through there to see it and when they got down in and turn and look out to the night sky there it is now watch the second bible then testifying back to the first [Applause] thank you jesus now watch this grand gallery this is the long passageway now watch we're going up the ascending passage and then it goes up into a spot that gets wider and taller called the grand gallery the grand gallery terminates at a great step beyond which a level floor under a low passageway takes one to the anti-chamber of the king's chamber now watch when you come up out of the grand gallery see this little thing is it comes up and flattens up now it gets very small moves out of the gigantic grand gallery which is very very tall 27 feet or something like that and then it goes down to 42 inches why you're approaching the kings [Applause] i'm afraid a lot of us are still in the grand gallery [Music] boy i'm a big shot you're going to get to the king big shot you better get down on your knees we'll never be able to approach the king with a grand gallery attitude come on church amen notice how god writes the very mystery of redemption who's found in here the king and the queen now what's amazing is as you come into this little small section before you come into the king's gallery this is called enoch's circle enoch circle a hebrew hebrew a hebrew and a piece of egyptian artwork i don't think so enoch's circle the anchor chamber is 10 foot long but 42 inches wide by 12 feet tall now notice how it opens up into this section here before you go over to the king's chamber enoch circle measures 365.25 inches genesis 5 23 and all the days of enoch were 365 years [Music] the dimensions of the holy of holies in the tabernacle match the exact same dimensions of the king's chamber in the great pyramid [Music] [Applause] is anybody seeing daylight glory to god before there was a moses before there was a temple the mischievous wrote right here don't you see friend god pointing to your destiny you're not earth bound you're not of this world you're pointing to the stars where you came from [Applause] lord jesus the dimensions of the holy of holies matching the king's chamber the interior capacity of the coffer on the inside of the king's chamber matches the identical measurements of the ark of the covenant lord jesus looking at the dimensions of the king's chamber and the dimensions of the sarcophagus within in terms of regular inches reveals evidence of the encoding of advanced information including circle sphere circle sphere geometry the use of 360 degree of arc on a complete circumference the math constants of pi and of radon the use of base 10 the precession cycle of earth's in years the speed of light glory to god now i know this is greek to most of you it's greek to me i'm just reading this i mean i think lord if it's this good and i don't even understand it what would it be if i understood it boy it would be good notice how for all these people can you imagine for these people who understand what all these words mean i mean you're just sitting there nodding me and acting like you know what i'm talking about but can you imagine for these people who understand what all this means and they go in there and measure all this and they think where did all this come from how did this all get here no wonder they get overwhelmed [Applause] the cycle of the earth and years the speed of light in the earth's atmosphere in terms of miles per second and the square root of five as the tangent of satellite speed the great pyramid was constructed of granite overlaid with 144 000 white limestone slabs [Music] glory to god oh i got up early this morning sat in and carol hollered at me up in the morning said hey how you doing i went up and spoke to her and i said i've been about to have a spill i've been about to have a spell this is what i was looking at 144 000 slabs on the outside of that pillar why because it is god's mystery of redemption it's me issue lord jesus listen to this the great pyramid constructed with granite overlaid with 144 000 white limestone slabs cut to optical precision the joints are consistently one fiftieth of an inch you knew builder brothers want to compare to this do you understand that our modern builders technology all that we have we could not rebuild this of course not there's no way we can build this there's no way we can do this but if the same one who designed this can get in here can't he live it out lord god cannot just save one living i cannot do it by the doubt in such precise way that only god could be designer of such a thing and his bride will not be within one fiftieth of an inch she will be the absolute image of him but i'm telling you we cannot reproduce this you cannot live this you cannot make this you say how am i going to do it then turn let go and let god you understand how big that is one fiftieth of an inch five pages of your bible so take five pages of your bible and hold it up there you go g-r-a-c-e f-a-i-g-h friends this is prophecy oh he said ain't nobody living right don't you never believe this there ain't going to be no bread don't you never believe that this has stood as a symbol for thousands of years a memorial hallelujah that god says there will be a people there won't be a people the cement was probably used as a lubricant to slide the blocks into position [Laughter] none of these highly polished stones weighed less than a ton topping the church of all ages as brother brown said it's got to be honed in that pyramid you can take a razor blade and you can't run between them rocks where the mortar was it's so fiddly put together he said spoken words original seed don't you understand what this is showing god's building and making a body and also a union between him and the bride notice the great pyramid was god's absolute that would preserve a wealth of knowledge for the generations born after the flood for instance the constant pie which more than a thousand years after the flood the egyptians did not know it reveals the shape of the earth its size and distance from the sun and that the poles were flattened who but god with no such things can't you see why they thought it was aliens can you see why scientists and people who don't want to acknowledge god they looked up and said it had to be aliens from outside the earth looking at all of it and they flew down here in a spaceship and told them well i can sort of go along with that but it wasn't space it was it was [Laughter] it wasn't spaceships it was traveling like a thought you know lord children it ain't no wonder this man was able to walk with god and walk out of this world look at what the man saw look at what god revealed to the man the whole mystery of redemption no wonder he got to a place he couldn't take it no more he just got to a place he said lord i can't stand this i can't tell you god said well just come out home you like the last stone i'll come out i'd like to have been setting any steady just sitting there praying and all of a sudden his directions come this geometry this power this circumference of the earth the poles being flat is that lord have mercy glory let god write it down and get up just walk around oh i don't know elohim almighty god almighty god go back and write it down a little bit more right now i want to say put a queen's chamber down beneath that put a pit because i'll go down to the pit and then i'll ascend up the ascending passageway and i'll go through and i'll get mcqueen and all this 2000 years of church ages i'll work my way up to the king's chamber and at the seventh day i'll have a messenger there that'll introduce the people to me [Applause] none of the latter pyramids reveal such perfection of mathematical and architectural skills as the great pyramid so then after the original there was churches churches brides brides churches churches brides brides but none of them contained the mystery [Applause] they were reproductions and there's something to look at i've been there i've seen them i've seen the set pyramid i've seen different pyramids been to mexico and seen some of the ones there but i've also seen the great pyramid [Applause] i'm not down planning to say something the baptist won't be saved the methodists some of the message folks all that sort of thing that's up to god but i know one thing there's only one that'll ever fit into this and this is god's own design who would want to cheat mimic when we can be in the great pyramid [Applause] lord brotherhood said just before the anti-living destruction the flood time they had a greater civilization than we have today and i believe they had control of atomic power i think that's the way they shook the world from its orbit and we're told to know the world stood upright but they had such mechanical and such science so they could build the pyramids things and so forth and we couldn't reproduce it today now this is not just a quote from brother brown but science tells us the same which we imagine it's hard for them to admit to we have no machinery to lift those blocks that far unless it would be atomic now you imagine enoch down there working with atomic power however it was that he done it so it wasn't hard for him to believe god could change his atoms [Applause] whatever they've done i mean however they went about doing it in the release of atomic power and they'll be able to cut them stones with laser precision they didn't say the god that can give me this understanding of this dividing an atom and lifting these blocks surely that god can change me if the god can write this up here can't that god change you if god left this for a memorial and god you know doing all the things that he did in the mountains and yet it was built it withstood the flood it withstood the fire it's withstood burglars it's withstood all kinds of things don't you understand it's a symbol of the church even the flood upon the earth and the living destruction could not destroy the pyramid god had a witness in the heavens the stars the first bible was stood the flood god had an earthly witness sitting in the land of egypt which is where the original garden of eden was so god had a witness saying i will restore say us lord lord jesus notice 144 000 casing stones highly polished and flat to an accuracy of one hundredth of an inch about a hundred inches thick and weighing about 15 tons each nearly perfect right angles for all six sides computer calculations indicate 40 745 casing stones are used averaging 40 tons each before the face angle was cut the number 144 comes up also in the book of revelation chapter 21 the height of the wall in the new city lord jesus you imagine it's my inspiration this man moved and he worked and thousands and thousands of workers under this man as they were bringing together the structural vision of prophecy and building every part and being home to this day to where our engineers and all of the people of this great day with their great intelligence cannot to this day figure out how they done it then we got everything made and the spirit of god said don't cap it leave the headstone the stone of scone over to one side by that you not know when the king come he would be rejected lord god brethren says in the easter seal the headstone was never put on the pyramid it's an open top if you've ever been there by the grace of god i have he said there's no top on the pyramid what is it enoch built it before the flood it was a memorial that's the reason it's never destroyed during the time of the flood there's nothing destroyed it because it's a memorial now if you notice way down on the bottom it's wide then it shapes up a little more in the minority and then a little more as it goes to the headstone that's the looser names justification the church sanctification than the baptism of the holy ghost but as it shapes toward the top it continues from the looser age to the westerly age amen to pentecostal age but after it leaves the pentecostal age it shapes up until it has to get to a place so those stones are so homes to the razorblade can't you see why the preaching of this day friend will hone us so fine it will be so close oh my now that's what god is doing to his church he's honing off his people and making it in such a perfect way that when the headstone christ comes it fits the building together and then a resurrection of the whole thing can't you see why the headstone must cap off our lives as individuals and why the headstone must cap off this age enoch's headstone will finally arrive and when the headstone comes and sets down not the skull stone of scone but jesus himself when he sets down on that bride and then the finale of his work amen glory what is that coming rapturing body changing time then it will cause the resurrection the charge from the headstone will charge down to looser down to wesley down to pentecost lord jesus notice he said when christ the heads on christ comes it fits the building together then a resurrection of the whole thing the church has gone up again it was famous names in enoch completed in his day or back in that day the pyramid because we haven't got time to background it show you how the pyramid come up to the chambers and so forth it speaks right straight to the end time now they're in the king's chamber now by the measurement but the headstone never was put on the pyramid that sets perfectly architecturally or masonry until even a thin razor blade they don't know how they ever built it don't understand could even a razor blade slice among themselves where the mortar should be i love this and there's no murder in it so listen to this that's when it is when christ and the church becomes one there's no mortar between [Applause] oh glory to god mortar was not used in the pyramid to hold rock to rock to rock to rock then that would have given element for something human made but god said don't do it enough just use the mortar to kind of make it greasy that's all make it within big old rocks and slide around i don't need no martyr he not i'm going to so attach myself to my people it'll be christ in them the hope of glory look friend god don't want you and then christ and then a preacher sandwiched in between his mortar or your mama or your daddy or even a prophet god wants you and him so together lord mercy i wonder how many people in the days of this man when they started looking at this design when there had never been a structure built quite this shape is it would you come up with that that is the weirdest building i've ever seen in my life we don't build buildings like that around here well you may not but i am [Applause] i wasn't even sensible in the desert with the winds blowing the way they do with all the things with the army stick out right in the middle of the desert like a sore son everybody coming through see it right now you're seeing daylight why didn't he invert the thing and turn it upside down and bury it where nobody would see it ye ye hallelujah are the light of the world a city set on the hill god don't want you inverted and laid a seal and not standing for what's right and true [Applause] lord jesus notice this god christ and the person again the capstone that goes upon the pyramid it was rejected never put on the pyramid isn't till this day the stone of scone this claim they claim but it never was put on the capstone why enoch and them in the early days built the pyramid down in egypt we find out in there they knew that the cornerstone the capstone would be rejected so prophetically he comes right up comes right up comes right out bills and bills and bills and bills and years and years and years and years and comes to the final saying god says don't that's the mystery of the end time don't write it you know just leave it over here glory to god lord jesus remember the dream and brother brown took a a crowbar of the thing and went and whipped the top off the pyramid shaped right mountain and said look down inside here look down inside your what was a white rock that had never been looked on before [Applause] [Music] stay here while i go west and come back oh glory i'm glad he went west and come back what'd he come back with the understanding of what the white rock was because they're still looking at one another didn't understand it we didn't either that's the way god has brought his church from justification trainification baptism of the holy ghost and now the ministry of the spirit which is what quickens the word that ministry in the church will have to be exactly like his so the second bible and that reaches its apex at the very top and i said master stonemason we're ready to cap it off he said don't cap it what i thought this was this is our crowning achievement this is the day we wave on we've been doing this thing for years don't cap it what are you supposed to do with this god said don't cap it leave the cap sitting over here somewhere it'll wind up in time britain will end up with it in france and this and that and the other but it'll come back it'll come back when they say law is in the desert don't believe it low is over here don't believe it for as the lightning shineth out of the east and cometh into the west isn't it amazing that's the way jesus said his coming would be it's backwards a lot of the message folks are looking to the west jesus didn't say look to the west he said as the lightning coming from the east and goes to the west not vice versa come on children i don't know about you i'm looking for that headstone well that's the same one that daniel saw a stone not made with hands hallelujah watch this out feast of the trumpets like the pyramid how it comes in the minority all the time great white from luther wesley pentecost and the caps on the top of soho and each one of those stones are so perfectly put together we don't know yet how they did it but it's so perfectly put together in that pyramid we're not a pyramid teaching now enoch and then built it years ago and it stands for a symbol just the same as the sun rises and says just the same amen as the tree drops its leaf and comes back again as a fish in the cattle everything as symbolizes it the pyramid stands as a symbol go into the prophet's chamber prophet's chamber enoch's circle it amazing for all these years i've been waiting for another prophet glory to god as far as we know not a prophet has stood in that prophet's chamber since enoch walked out of there the last time thousands of years ago now you know naturally you're gonna saw himself so here he's right at the very top he's right near the king's chamber walking in there you imagine as they finish everything and they start backing out they back out from the king's chamber and work their way out finishing everything whatever hieroglyphics need to go here go there and do this out of the other and he not backs out of enoch circle he know backs out of enoch circle and he goes to measuring it around 365.25 well that lets me know how long i'm going to live oh glory to god i see my life i see my life right here do you see yours [Applause] you imagine as he turned and got to that door and turns around the last time and he looks around into eternity because the circle of course represents eternity he just kind of spun around and said i'll see you again one day and he starts down to send him down the green gallery going out the descending passageway and he closes and goes out for the last time and seals the mystery of god elijah was a great man but elijah never had the ministry to walk up in the seven steps of the prophet's chamber and introduce the people of his day to the seven seals paul was a great man but god never allowed paul to go up the descending chamber up into the great hall and stop at the prophet's chamber peter was a great man luther wesley pentecost you understand what i'm saying but god was building building building moving moving moving and he started out a man in the last day under the administration of malachi 4. he starts out real wide at the bottom 50 60 reaching out to everybody but as it keeps going it gets getting married now and why the mystery of the pyramid is road in his own life [Applause] finally he'll rise to that spot tree says my mission to the earth is to forerun that coming world i'm not i'm not he'd come to tell you he is coming he is coming but he is here so once again we have one in the prophet's chamber to the prophet's chamber is that an invitation huh brother baby says go into the prophet's chamber so apparently that means i have permission to go right if i come to your house and you say brother don't go in the kitchen anything you want little debbie's in there pepsi snickers roast beef sandwich anything you want go in and get it well i ain't gonna understand you if i go in and get it and you get madder and hornet if you don't want me to get it don't tell me to go get it well says go into the prophet's chamber i believe i will into the prophet's chamber and watch them seven steps where did the guard meet the challenge to bring the comer into the presence of the king at the top of the steps was in the seventh step now watch how steps are built for you brothers that are carpenters and you take them bill the stringer and cut it all out one step leads into the other right so you step like this and then it comes up and then it leads to that one and leads to that one and leads to that one and they're all tied together to make steps right to go up your house up your staircase whatever more so they tie one into the other you don't have each one hanging they're suspended and you're going around on swings and fishing line and trying to but they're actually tied in so paul's message tied into the second age second into the third third and the fourth fourth and the fifth fifth and the sixth and then you come to the seventh when you arrive and i hope you understand we have arrived [Applause] and what was it we were dead now we're dead if we are not bidden we are dead but the king amen from the king's chamber has invited us come into the prophet's chamber [Applause] then we arrive at the seventh step their shoes we've got to come again with that same spirit that was on john he introduced the messiah was greater than all the prophets he introduced it and we've come to a place again to something that's going to introduce the messiah then it's to say a lot of folks around the message got in the prophet's chamber and they set up housekeeping they got to bed their table they got everything said no they don't want to go no farther of course i ain't talking about the bride because the bride don't want to stop at the prophet's chamber she wants to go into the king's chamber i love the prophet i thank god for him i give him respect but he ain't the one i'm going to marry for him he ain't the one that created me brother graham is not the designer of this structure i want to marry the man who made this royally i want to be a part of the man who made this [Applause] let me see if i can find a place to close here he not builds the entire mystery of god and god says include in this program their destiny their origination and give them a little preview of their future home watch this brother branham and laying out now that their future home and of course most of us up until this time in 1964 looking for heaven to be basically built as a cube or a rectangle but all of a sudden something strikes the prophet and never preached it before of course it's no wonder he's standing on the seventh step he himself has now progressed and grown and he's moved and moved and now he's at the seventh step and looking back and said my lord i'm on a pyramid this ain't a box this ain't a rectangle this is a pyramid the breadth of heights are the same that would make it 1500 miles this way this way 1500 miles of length by the breadth of the height think of it transparent gold the city had a wall about it now that doesn't mean necessarily mean by being equal and while it's a foundation or equal doesn't necessarily mean that it's a cube or a square there is another geographical measure which of course sets at the center of the earth and divides the earth into four quarters and how john saw the new jerusalem descending from god out of heaven reckon where it'll be i can pretty well tell you the apex will be right exactly where the great pyramid is today center of the earth that's what he wants to be in your life [Applause] he don't want to be over here on the side up here in the north somewhere he wants to be the center of everything that we are oh god he wants to be the center of everything that we are thank you lord jesus but the dimensions are the same that is a pyramid four square life foursquare and the walls are the same this being this way would answer exactly enoch's sign in egypt the pyramid would it enoch before them delivering destruction which justification was coming in brought forth a sign and then this pyramid is seven steps going to the king's chamber watch on that seventh step if you ever study the dimensions of the pyramid what comes out to take the oncomer to introduce to the king now notice how brother man identifies himself he's not the king he's to introduce you to the king watch that station that is standing there and you'll see the day you're living in the pyramid so i want to find myself i want to see what day i'm living in the pyramid as jesus said no man can take salt and add one cubit to his stature that's not necessarily the measurement on a wall but that's length of age length of age prolonging age or span of time so i want to find where i'm at i don't want to go backwards i don't want to go too far forward i want to find where i'm at you understand now once again in future home god made three bibles there's a pyramid teaching this nonsense but there's a genuine pyramid see now god he made three had to have everything in three jesus comes three times come wants to redeem his bride next time to get his bride next time with his bride isn't that beautiful oh my did you understand what all three of them comings was about bright bright bride first coming redeem his bride second time guinness by third time worth his bride it sounds like to me i mean you're on his heart big time glory to god hallelujah you are identified in all three comings of jesus christ [Applause] how beautiful in this pyramid was seven steps the king's chamber and we're in the seventh church age before the king takes his and in the earth's time of purifying by its baptism of fire there will be volcanics such as the earth exploding and will push up a pyramid like mountain there'd be plenty of room to do it because the whole thing will be changed the whole surface will be changed you got it it'll push up a pyramid like mountain so from the center of the earth will come up by volcanic action will come up a pyramid-like mountain and then john saw the new city the new jerusalem descending from god out of heaven what is it it's the capstone which is also shaped like a pyramid and it will come down and set on the mountain oh lord children don't you understand he's doing the same thing with the new city what he's done for you the new city comes down like this the earth is churning and churning and volcanoes and they're belching and bouncing and it'll push and push and push and push up a gigantic mountain but it'll be without a headstone and then john looked and he said i know i saw a new heavens in the new earth and i saw them in the city of the new jerusalem center for god out of heaven as a pride going for a husband and here comes the headstone can you imagine a 1500 mile headstone [Applause] but don't worry the same god who builds pyramids know how to lower headstones he knows how to pick rocks up he knows how to let him down he knows how to build big things he knows how to do all that oh lord and john saw that headstone coming right down and just settle right down on the earth heaven and earth embrace and they are eternally sealed together lord jesus and the new city in the new earth the new creation the city on the hill with the throne on the top of it brother members illustration and the wall that's all around had 12 foundations and each one of them had the breaststone that was in aaron which represented the 12 tribes and in the gates four gates said exactly the temple in the wilderness like the tent in the wilderness each one had apostles three on each side twelve apostles 144 cubits exactly 216 feet making each one of those big stones almost 20 foot tall the breastplate in that gate the breastplate in the gate you knock the stone base william branham a stone miss let me bring it on down donny reagan a stone mace you saw other god come in stone me we don't want a guy that just should go down lows and buy some stick on stuff we want the real stuff whatever it takes to cut me and shape me listen your friend your favorite put just put the stuck on stuff and they'll on on this pyramid over there it'll never withstood the flood neither with the church or the living god but she's withstood the test of time will you stand together [Applause] lord jesus you know it's amazing when you look at all these things and hitting in the circumference and the measurements in the geometry of this is actually the formula of power square you take the circumference of the earth and the circumference of the sun and the circumference of the moon and you go to laying all them out in the circle inside the square and you find that these dimensions are an exact parallel and now we of course know how this is by all these different types of equipment they have to measure it but how did he not come up with that designer himself this is why we can have confidence in his way people say it's too hard it's too difficult no he knows how to build a church a pyramid had never been built before in the earth but god knew how to build it but what if enoch would have bucked him now this ain't going to work god i'm telling you i i've been to every builder in egypt i've been to every building in babylon none of them will say this thing will ever work but he trusted god now noah built an ark an ark was suitable for animals but enoch built the word of stone which was fitting for who king queen and the 144 thousand then once it settles down on the earth then all the inhabitants the kings will be included where not in the headstone because they've been the headstone in life they'll be included on the rest of the mountain they're down from under the throne will come the river of life and it'll trickle down in your backyard and if i live below you or whoever lives below you it'll trickle down down down sort of like the hanging gardens of babylon nebuchadnezzar had married a woman from an area that had a lot of force country and she so missed her home that she just couldn't get over her home so you know what he done he had his architects to build her when the ancient seven wonders of the world the hanging gardens of babylon that was built for a wife that missed her home [Applause] isn't it amazing he loves you so much he don't want to take you off in heaven and leave you up there and wispy white clouds and the zeal blue and all that sort of thing they said no i know her she's her body's from the earth she'll want to go back to the earth so the earth starts bouncing pushing out pushing out higher than the himalayas bigger than the appalachians but was no cap but the chief designer made it just exactly where it capped all fifteen hundred miles across straighter than any laser could ever shoot it [Music] then he'll lose his power and all of a sudden this city which will weigh billions and billions and billions of tons can you imagine all the gold the silver all the metals that's going to come out of heaven on some kind of elevator or some kind of hallelujah the chief designer and he'll let her float right down and their sins the pride gently lord gently and now women are about moving furniture you know gently look like a feather just base of your city here we are standing suspended as we watch it just lands right there and it says it's done children come on here [Music] now i've done to the earth what i did to you i took you from the devil and i sealed you i took the earth from the devil and now i've sealed it lord jesus lord jesus sometimes we just don't know what to say we just get so from him help us lord don't let one of us be missing lord may we not resent holding shaping it's hard on our flesh we don't like it we don't enjoy it hold me lord cut me shape me so i can fit i admit i need the touch of a master mason i've got i've got things about me lord this whole human part that need to be shaped and cut mow me lord hold me that i can fit into the headstone and lord god if there's one here today that doesn't know you in peace may you speak to their hearts hallelujah your prophet told us in 1962 end time evangelism was taking the stones and shaping them into sons of god he said confessions with stones but he said many people then don't want to be shaped which is the attitude to many message folks i believe the message i believe this i believe i believe i believe i ain't what makes them mad but what makes them mad is when the word goes to really shaping them and cutting them what good's a pile of rocks i don't want a pile of rocks lord you don't want a pile of rocks you want us cut and we'll be more precise than the pyramid a hundredth of an inch a fiftieth of an inch oh no that'll never work in this it'll be the most perfect building that has ever been built and we know you'll do it help us lord jesus we love you today father oh i love it when you do this to us i love it when you just unveil yourself and you stand before us and we just look at you and we're just awestruck that must have been what that little eagle felt like that day in the barnyard when his mama was suspended above him and he was all struck by what he saw just overwhelmed just overpowered overjoyed overfilled oh my i love it when you do that to us when you just get above us and you show us your greatness and you show us a little bit of what you are and we just stand and behold you and we don't know what to say we don't have even to worship you we don't even have to respond back we're just down there with our mouths open as it were oh jesus thank you father we love you lord god thank you lord jesus hallelujah can we just raise our hands now before we go in the presence of this great king surely friends a god who is so meticulous in his great work if he's watched down through the ages over such things surely he can take care of me and you if he knows when a robin falls to the ground and every little bird today every little thing of nature he knows how to provide when the hinds will calf in the winter when the frost will come across the trees if he loves that so much how about me and you how much more does he love us oh if he could only just convince us of it or we could trust him and just let go of what we are trust our emotions our motives our objectives everything to him just be like a little child today who's fixing to go out in the cold and you need to put a coat on and you struggle and you struggle because you're convinced you can do it yourself leah this morning one of erica's little girls our car seat the car seat sitting in our car it's very hard for them to buckle it but they're at that age that they can do anything and everything or they think they can anyway but she wrestled with it and wrestled with it this morning and she said poppy i can't buckle myself in i thought yeah it took a lot for her to admit that because she thinks she can it's way with us brothers gentlemen we can come to the spot i cannot reproduce this pyramid can we say that i cannot reproduce i cannot live that i cannot do it myself i need help buckle me in lord live your life out of me help me jesus help me jesus and it won't be me no way it'll be you living your life out of me how can you sing that for us how much more you love him today you enjoyed the word [Music] falls [Music] if he kisses the roars with the morning mist i wonder how much [Music] in an [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] is [Music] amen how much more that he is [Music] is [Music] yes [Applause] [Music] peace [Music] that's how much [Music] [Applause] he can speak peace [Music] loves me [Music] glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord jesus thank you lord jesus how beautiful heaven must be i sing it together as we prepare to go we read of a place [Music] it's made for the the pure and the free these truths and god's bible first second and third they are written [Music] how beautiful yes lord jesus of the happy and [Music] we how beautiful heaven must be we'd like to have special prayer today carol's sister sharon has been diagnosed as many of you know we've been praying for was breast cancer been giving her therapy treatments chemotherapy and things like that they had to stop it this week because of something affecting her heart and her heart function has decreased greatly and they're really concerned the doctors are not going to give her any more treatments until they can be able to find out what's going on with her you know what our god that we've heard about this morning that's not too great for him you believe that let's take her before the lord in prayer heavenly father lord as carol stands here today i know lord this is weight heavy on her heart and mine and lord man these people don't know sharon but yet as part of the same family we can feel for those that we've never even met in the flesh even for those that lord
