while ago there's a sister that he's very concerned about a very urgent prayer request and he's asking that we would take her to the Lord in prayer as she goes through a very difficult time in her life so we'll remember that brother Jerry Alderman from Clover South Carolina called to ask everyone to pray about an unspoken request that God knows all about we'll just commit that to the Lord today still remember brother Joel Forney recovering from another stroke so we want to remember him as we pray that God would just give him healing in his body and may he be able to return to his to his to his post of Duty we just asked the Lord for that brother Byron Palmer says to please pray for brother Eddie Meyer of Morning View Kentucky he has a had a third heart attack while recovering from shoulder replacement surgery doctors say he may need a pacemaker or further heart surgery so we want to commit that need unto the Lord this morning brother and sister baker has an unspoken prayer request they'd like for you to pray about this is a testimony sent over to the library recently a prayer request was turned in by Brother John Taylor and his wife Linda from New York for their daughter Emily who lost her husband two years ago to cancer this caused her enormous physical and mental stress that prevented her from being able to work and function normally but they want to thank everyone for their prayers as God has moved on her behalf they have seen her improve greatly and she has been able to return to work we are trusting and believing for a complete restoration our God is an awesome God and he hears our prayer so thank God for what he's doing for that that lady this morning amen sister Martha sacker assisted please pray for my nephew and my two nieces their dad passed away unexpectedly they have three younger stepbrothers that were with their dad they're moving them here and trying to figure out who they are going to live with so may the Lord just intervene in that

praise the Lord there's something about first love when you first get saved you start serving the lord and loving him I understand that he loves you but there's also something about learning to trust him and as much as we wish it could happen just like that it really doesn't it takes time don't it to where you can trust him just when things are going absolutely upside down seems like but yeah you know that the Lord is absolutely perfect in all his timing are you happy to be here today amen I guarantee you there's two people sitting right back there in that corner right by that door Mr and miseries Lance Parker they are really happy we're just so grateful I know it may seem little to you a lot of folks could go to church every time the church doors is open they let the list of little thing hinder them but what Eric has been through in the last three years people will text me all the time from around the world what's happening male I mean the world nearly every day how's she doing how's she doing how's Erica and to be able to say she had a good day what a victory that is and yet I wonder how many of us have a good day after a good day after a good day after good day and we don't even thank the Lord for it we don't know how to appreciated do we amen let's turn to Saint John chapter 11 if you would this morning we're so happy to be together today in the presence of the Lord now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany the town of Mary and her sister Martha it was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was sick therefore his sister sent unto him saying behold he whom thou lovest is sick so now they didn't go but they sent a messenger and these are the words that the messenger told them he whom thou lovest is sick or don't God love everybody well he does in that sense but he said these were close friends or let me say it this way so they thought when Jesus heard that is not what he said he said this sickness is not unto death now if you would have been standing there that day and you would have heard this statement and then you're going to hear a few more statements after this about 10 verses after this I wonder what you would have thought because you would have thought that man is a liar because I heard him say myself that sickness is not unto death and then in verse 14 he turns right around and says Lazarus is dead now we said right here that it was not the sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God so to lie of course he didn't lie you just got to know what he's talking about that the son of God might be glorified thereby oh so now I see so Jesus let this terrible thing happen to Lazarus that he might be glorified notice again how John emphasizes the love part in verse 5. now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus why is he saying this twice I mean just back to back verse to verse Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus when he heard therefore that he was sick he abode two days still in the same place where he was so Jesus loved them and they sent for Jesus instead of Jesus going when they beckoned Jesus stayed there for two more days but John tells us two verses he loved them I wonder if there's anybody here besides Lazarus and me and a few more that's ever had that happen to you Jesus loved you and you knew he did you know that you loved him and yet you pray for something and he waits and he waits and he waits I mean a lot to be remembered today as we pray God bless each of you hold your needs your request and your heart father it's with Thanksgiving that we are approaching you today we're grateful for another opportunity that we can assemble ourselves together Lord we thank you for all that you've done for us we thank you for all that you're doing thank you Lord for the meetings that we've heard about up in Ohio was some of our youths that are there today and they'll be breaking up before long the service there and starting back this way and we pray you'd watch over as they travel keep your hand upon them not only our youth of course but others as well Lord some sick and couldn't be in service today some Lord out traveling vacations visiting this and that so we pray that you'd watch over your people I want to say thank you I want to say thank you sir Lance and Eric able to be with us today in church we're believing that it's going to completely turn around and they're coming to church won't be a treat it will be a regular shout and spell amen hallelujah but we wait on you and we know your timing is perfect amen amen help me to step aside for just a few moments that you might be able to speak through me the words of God to your people today Father in the name of Jesus we pray amen God bless you you may be seated the story goes on of course and you're familiar with it and they Converse back and forth a little bit and Jesus says that he's asleep and the disciples said well that's good if he's asleep and then in verse 14 then Jesus said unto them plainly Lazarus it's dead but I thought this sickness was not unto death isn't it amazing that deaths can mean two separate things the English word death you see Abraham had the type of faith that he believed that if God required him to take the life of his son that God would raise him from the dead on the mountain and they would walk back down the mountain together because he said the lad and I go and we will worship and we will come back [Music] I want you to notice in verse 15 that the Bible says and I'm glad for your sakes that I was not there wow what what A peculiar man the Lord Jesus must have been it must have been so difficult to try to understand what he would say and what he meant and he'd say one thing and then seemingly say something the exact opposite and we know what part of it was because he was a dual person and part of the time it would be him saying it and part of the time it would be the father saying it part of the time he would be expressing in human language what she what she did here and then he would have to override the human part and speak in Divine language and then sometimes it go the other way he'd speak in Divine language and they couldn't get it then he'd have to override that and speak in human language so they could comprehend what he was saying imagine as the news came back to Mary and Marson Lazarus probably was so sick by then he couldn't talk and he was unconscious of what was going on but Mary and Martha they must have been so confused and trying to understand I just I don't I don't understand now remember they had made tapestries and they they wove material and interwoven those things and so material and tapestries and once they started following Jesus they had a great great rejection from the synagogue where they had always went no doubt a lot of their their people who bought from them were people of Wales which of course attended the synagogue but they heard that Mary and Martha and Lazarus had got into a cult and they heard that they were following this very unusual strange man which supposedly was born of a virgin now whoever heard of that before and they must have had such gossip and rumors about it and they themselves had lost their reputation they had lost their respect among the people now there wasn't really much of a middle class and that day you was either the rich or the dog poor and they had been kind of straddling that event to where they was more identified with the rich people than they were the poor but it was the rich in that day that pretty much hated Jesus there's a few of them that loved him but for the most part a lot of their riches was tied to corruption Jesus he just blessed so they felt like he had a vendetta against them the rich you know the Pharisees they were the ultra rich and they were the wealthy and so to be identified if you wanted favor you know it didn't really change much then you would kind of be identified with the rich folks of Judaism and then you could get the work and you could get the jobs and you could get this and that so Martha Mary and Lazarus it had been a little bit tighter for him financially they would meet people on the street that before had bought their past their tapestries and pain upper prices for them now they wouldn't even speak to him now whenever they would see them they'd cross the street and go the other way because they had heard this occult leader had actually become very close friends with them someone had told them recently that this occult leader had come to their house and spent time there this Jesus so Mary and Martha and Lazarus was having a difficult time they were having a hard time financially a hard time socially they were being rejected they were being so misunderstood and they had given so much to follow Jesus now had they give a very little bit and they had not really committed much to him it wouldn't have hurt them near as bad no doubt they would have been able to think well you know what really I guess I deserve this because I've kind of followed him at a distance anyway and I've not given up hardly anything for him at all they were the very opposite they had lost part of their business portion of their income they had lost a position of reputation among the people the scribes the Pharisees the essenes the herodians the rich the wealthy had bought their tapestries anymore they couldn't even hard to give them away because that's identified with Jesus and now they come to this time in their life now what I want to speak to you about this morning is The Darkest Hour then Jesus comes along and they need a friend they need a favor and they've not really asked Jesus for anything so far we have no record that they ask him of anything but now they really need him so they send a messenger and they just know beyond a shot of the doubt that Jesus will come running literally he will come running they gave him a room in their house they gave up the reputation for him they gave up their honor among the wealthy people of Jerusalem and the surrounding areas everybody associated with the temple knews him and they forfeited that for him so they thought no doubt like you and I have before when we've been in real difficult spots and we just do when we pray the Lord would come immediately and sometimes it's as if though he turns his back and walks away from us and goes over and heals somebody with short hair or a woman with a pair of pants on or a man that's still smoking and here you gave up smoking years ago and you quit drinking years ago and you've loved him and served him all for years of your life and instead of coming your way he turned and went to somebody else and seemed like gave them your miracle well you see the reason he had to go to them quicker was because they were less immature than you they had faith but they didn't have trust they had faith that would be able to touch him if he moved suddenly but they did not have a persistent face that if he delayed day after day week after week month after month and even go into maybe year after year they would not be found serving him after six months but you would so he uses them for one example of his glory and he uses you Martha for another and he uses you Mary for another and you Lazarus for another I can imagine as the messenger comes back to the house in Bethany where they lived and it's announced of course that he's back Mary and Martha are just taken back they don't they don't know what to say they just where is he and The Messengers kind of shakes his head and Bows his head he don't want to tell them he doesn't have an answer really that's going to help console them the answer is going to give them about Jesus is actually going to make them feel worse isn't that strange he's coming with a message about Jesus and about their relationship and the message he's going to give them is actually going to make them feel worse lower forsaken belittled humiliated they sure didn't need that or did they so the messenger comes and well where is is he is he on his way no my lady I'm so sorry to have to tell you this but he acted like he acted like he didn't even care not women of course we know are more emotional most the time than men are and you can imagine Mary and Martha they just burst out in tears what he must he must have misunderstood you did you make it clear I made it clear you were desperate I made it so clear that I saw John's face the Beloved John I saw John's face as he got this look of stress I watched Peter as he you know harder what Peter always was but I watched Peter and said the look come upon him and that's the Jesus almost emotionless his face looked as if though I just said it's a nice day no expression of pain no expression of Sorrow no expression even of love and concern I'm so sorry to have to tell you this but I don't think he's coming what but we forfeited our living we gave up our Associates I've given years of my life for him and I need him if I ever needed him I need him now well maybe you misunderstood maybe he just had some things he needed to take care of and it did what did he say what did he say for you to tell me you never said anything what did he say love just he didn't did he say he was mindful of us it didn't he say maybe tomorrow he didn't I'm telling you my lady he didn't say I've been there when I would give ten thousand dollars just for a rebuke from him just to let me know he's still new I was alive anybody ever been there boy when he goes silent you better believe oh blabbermouth goes to run in his mouth oh now they are hit with what looks like the Stark reality that this apparently is not the friend we thought he was brother man says it this way about their situation now Here Comes Mary and Morrison their Dark Hours had come and Jesus had failed them seemingly all the hopes was gone everything was in the black and the first thing you know the darkest hour they had then Jesus comes along here's what he comes just at that dark hour doesn't he you can imagine now for however long that it was at the end of their mind they're not only dealing with the deaths of their brother this is part of the breadwinner now we don't know anything about the mother and father apparently gone but Lancers would have been the head of the home and they're not only losing their brother but they're losing the head of their home and Jesus says absolutely nothing it sends them he doesn't even send them a condolence to Mary and Martha I am so sorry you don't say that I love you uh he doesn't write a note and say I'll be there shortly says nothing now you know it's the time in between verse 15. and verse 20. there's only five short verses but in there can be such a span of time of misunderstanding distrust Satan's lies our imagination us figuring this and that and the other most the time it's wrong anyway but we do it don't we but then Jesus comes now the father releases him in the vision for him to come to where they are we'll pick up in verse 20. then Mark says soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met him but Mary sat still in the house now we grieve different than the way the Middle Eastern people did then let's still do today really a lot compared to more similar to them than what we would it should go to a lot of funerals in this day and time folks don't ever shed a tear but grief was something that they so experienced in such a deep way and job and kings and in Proverbs and different places we could take the scriptures and show that the way that they would enter into grieving was such a painful thing it's like they would become so overwhelmed by grief that they couldn't even move now I do not believe that by her face and his word that Mary was being disrespectful but she had so entered into the grief and it was so painful and losing her brother that she was just she was just Smitten by grief and could not move but Martha Rises up and she goes out and somebody tells her that Jesus is coming now the prophet tells us about this that she had every right to upgrade him she had every right to say and I thought you was a man of God I thought you was a servant of God so let me just ask you all if y'all in the middle of the heart attack that Franklin Woods or the med center wherever it is you've got a real desperate need and you call me on the phone brother Donnie you've got to come immediately and what if the spirit of God said don't go now but I went tomorrow I wonder how many of you would even speak to me if I walked in the door or you'd say I call for you yesterday and you're my pastor you sorry preacher you but what if the Lord had a greater phase of his glory he wanted to reveal by making me not go at your bidding now this is what they did not know but to them on their part it looks absolutely as if Jesus doesn't even con he's a concern himself with their trouble now Martha has a right of course to be able to say and here I saw you as a man of love you was a great man that cared for your people and look what we've done for you when we ask for one favor boy you're some kind of man of God notice then said my son to Jesus Lord if thou art has been your my brother had not died if you would have only been here you could have stopped him from dying but notice her attitude now though in verse 22 but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it thee now she she still knew in spite of all the misunderstanding in spite of the delay in spite now think of it by now they've already buried him they didn't do like we do they died that morning they buried it but that afternoon remember analysis Sapphira whenever a hunt and Ice died they took him out there and buried him Sapphire didn't even know he was dead until she walks in and the same thing happens to her so they'd already buried him it's been four days now four days late seems like the nose has already fallen in his skin worms has already started eating on his body but somehow Martha still says I know even now whatever you ask God he will do it oh I hope it got some Martha sitting here today it was The Darkest Hour this family had ever known and yet Jesus seemed to delay the answer of Deliverance but we know the story as it goes on that Jesus of course tells her that he is the resurrection and then Jesus begins to call for Mary and John goes on to say Mary the master has come and call us for thee the master is come so she comes out of course and then her and and Martha together oh Jesus if you'd only been your our brother would not have died and well where have you laid him so take him there to the place where they've laid him shortest verse in the Bible and Jesus wept oh but they begin to tell him Lord he by now he stinketh he stinks you you can't you you can't do this no not now Lord it's too far gone it's too far gone by now he stink us and Jesus tells them and asks them something else that seems so harsh that Jesus asked Mary I'm Martha to roll away the stone not their slaves not the apostles big Brony fishermen standing there can you imagine two women women grieving two women that are grieving and the heart is broken because of their brother and they're still dealing with this misunderstanding about Jesus delay and Jesus even puts more on him and said I'll tell what I want you to to do I want you two to move the Rock [Music] now just think in your mind what would have been your opinion of this great miracle-working preacher would you have stood off and said I cannot believe he would dare do such a thing poor Mary can hardly walk look at Martha she's staggering under the influence of this tremendous loss and what does that occult leader do tell them to move the stone but Mary and Martha if you can do it this will be the last part of your part of the miracle praise God I wonder sometimes if Jesus ain't got one more rock that you and I need to move out of the way before the miracle blows wide open Hallelujah I know we're not careful we'll feel sorry for ourselves and how in the world would he ever ask don't he know I've give so much I've done so much but he wants a little more he wants a little more and that if you will give that little more he will do what you cannot do now we know him well enough to know that he would have never asked them to move that stone if they could not have moved it did they strain no doubt they did you imagine two women and they would make them so like a trough I've stood there and seen supposedly where Lazarus was buried and some of them they would dig it down in a hole and it would be a round type Stone and it'd be over the top of it like this the mouth of the cave others would be one that they had dug a trough this way and the door was upright like this and they would cut around stone so they could roll it and they would have to stand there and push and push and push but Lazarus was not exactly like the Tomb of Jesus it was one that that had a different opening with a different type of energy that was going to be needed to move it out of the way and yet these women pushing and shoving and pushing with everything they had oh my you imagine that Sun as it was so hot and they began to break out in perspiration and they were there Lord why would you ask us and Peter said that Peter leave her alone John 7 force Andrew then be brought him in as I said them said leave them alone push Mary push Marcia then I'll raise the Dead Hallelujah you imagine by the time they get it open but the first little crack as they as they go past and then the smell and the stench of the brother's body comes out and hits them and now this nausea the grief and the trauma that they're already dealing with and then the smell of Rotting Flesh as it hits them in the face and they they feel this sickness come over them but they've only got a little bit further to go oh Mary let me tell you today keep pushing that rock away from that tomb door Marcia keep pushing that rock lousas and Jesus is waiting on you hallelujah oh brother sister it might be your son it might be your daughter sisters it might be your husband or it might be your wife Brothers whoever it is it might be a son or a daughter that needs salvation needs the Holy Ghost keep pushing that rock but brother Donnie I feel like I can't if Jesus told you to do it he's got faith in you that you can push it oh Hallelujah if Jesus is withholding what you've been asking for for a while he's got a reason he has confidence in you and apparently him and the devil had a meeting not long ago and Jesus was testified and Jesus said I want to tell you I've got a son down there in Johnson City I've got a daughter over in Asheville I've got one over here and there and they believe me no matter what you tell them devil or the devil said I'll tell you one thing you withdraw your blessing you'd hold back your healing for a year or two years or whatever it is and I'll guarantee you I'll make them curse it to your face and Jesus said no you won't I know my son I know my daughter or brother sister I want you to have confidence in me as I want to have it in you I want to have a reputation among the people of God but I'll tell you where I really want to have a reputation and that's up in heaven that if the Lord Jesus and the devil have a meeting together and Jesus says I'd like to testify to your devil I've got a son down on the Earth by the name of Donnie I have fellowship with him every day me and him talk together we associate together and said the Lord Jesus goes to tell them the devil sings about me I want to be able to stand faithful and make that testimony bear true anybody else here today feel the same way if you've got your shoulder Against The Storm and you feel like it ain't moving and you're doing more so
