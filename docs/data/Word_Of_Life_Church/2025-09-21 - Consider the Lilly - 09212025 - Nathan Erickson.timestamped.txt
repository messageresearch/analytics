[19:40] Oh, Satan had already picked out my
[19:44] grave. His plan had moved forward to put
[19:48] me away. I'd drifted so far. Would

[21:18] I knew my destruction was a matter of
[21:22] time. But Jesus appeared and said, "This
[21:26] one is mine now. I'm safe with no harm."
[21:31] He walked through the storm. He came

[28:04] road.
[28:06] A sinner
[28:08] far
[28:09] from
[28:11] home.
[28:13] No second chance
[28:17] inside.
[28:19] I heard you call
[28:22] my
[28:24] name.
[28:26] I felt you lift
[28:29] my
[28:30] shame.
[28:32] I made a vow
[28:35] that day that I'd spend the rest
[28:42] of my life
[28:46] [Music]
[28:48] loving my Jesus.
[28:54] stoing my scars,
[29:00] telling my story
[29:04] of how mercy
[29:08] can reach you where you are.

[29:16] world
[29:18] hears the cry of my heart.
[29:25] to see all the ones
[29:29] I love
[29:32] loving my Jesus.
[29:38] Sin tries to make
[29:42] you hide.
[29:45] Whispers that same
[29:48] old lie.
[29:51] Keep all your pain
[29:54] inside
[29:57] cuz no one will un
[30:01] understand.
[30:03] The last thing this lost
[30:06] world needs is someone I'm trying to
[30:14] be. The truth that has set
[30:19] me
[30:20] free is I'm just a broken
[30:26] man.
[30:29] [Music]
[30:31] Loving my Jesus,

[30:58] world
[31:00] hears the cry of my heart.
[31:07] To see all the ones
[31:10] I love
[31:13] loving my Jesus.
[31:23] When all is said
[31:26] and done,
[31:29] when my last song's
[31:32] been sung, I stand face to face
[31:38] with the one
[31:42] who gave all
[31:45] for me.
[31:48] May all I have to
[31:52] show
[31:54] be all that matter
[31:58] most.
[32:00] Making your great name known. Let this
[32:07] be my only
[32:10] legacy.
[32:11] [Music]
[32:15] Loving my Jesus,
[32:21] showing my scars,

[32:42] world

[33:00] I
[33:02] love.
[33:07] loving my Jesus.

[33:19] [Applause]
[33:40] [Music]
[33:47] I wandered far
[33:51] from the fool where I was safe.
[33:55] [Music]
[33:58] It wasn't long
[34:02] till I found I'd lost my way.
[34:06] [Music]
[34:09] I cried with fear
[34:13] as I began to fall.
[34:17] [Music]
[34:21] One more lost lamb.
[34:24] But I heard the shephers call.
[34:28] [Music]
[34:32] He saw my steps as they walked right
[34:37] into the dark.
[34:40] [Music]
[34:43] Though I went astray,
[34:47] I never once left his heart.
[34:54] That night long ago,
[34:58] how I still recall.
[35:06] Though I lost my way,
[35:09] I heard the shepherd's call.
[35:12] [Music]
[35:16] He left the fold
[35:19] to search out that one that stray.
[35:23] [Music]
[35:27] Left 99
[35:30] cuz there was one to be saved.
[35:34] [Music]
[35:34] [Applause]
[35:38] There on that ledge,
[35:41] one step would have ended it all.
[35:45] [Music]
[35:48] Oh, but I felt the hand
[35:52] and I heard the shephers call.
[35:56] [Music]
[36:00] He saw my steps as they walked right
[36:04] into the dark.
[36:09] [Music]
[36:11] Though I went astray,
[36:14] I never once left his heart.
[36:18] [Music]
[36:21] that night long ago.
[36:24] How I still recall.
[36:30] [Music]
[36:32] When I lost my way,
[36:35] I heard the shephers call.
[36:43] He saw my steps as they walked right
[36:47] into the dark.
[36:53] Though I went astray,
[36:56] I never once left his heart.
[37:04] that night long ago.
[37:07] How I still recall
[37:14] when I lost my way.
[37:18] I heard the shepherd's call.
[37:25] Oh, that not long ago.
[37:28] How I still recall
[37:35] when I lost my way.
[37:38] I heard the shepherds call.
[37:42] [Music]
[37:50] Amen.
[37:52] [Applause]
[37:56] Certainly appreciate those songs this
[37:57] morning. Amen. As we change a word of
[38:00] the service, Brother Ericson's going to
[38:01] be ministering for this morning.
[38:02] Certainly looking forward to that. Amen.
[38:04] We come with an expectation. Amen. Pull
[38:06] upon the gift this morning. Let the Lord
[38:08] speak to your heart. Whatever you have
[38:09] need of this morning. Amen. He's here to
[38:13] answer that need. Amen. To answer that
[38:15] question you have in your life. Amen.
[38:17] God. He's here and can take care of each
[38:19] and every one of us this morning. Amen.
[38:22] Let's just sing this little chorus. My
[38:23] chains are gone. Let's sing that this
[38:24] morning. Amen. As he prepares to come
[38:26] minister for us.
[38:29] Oh, my chains are gone.
[38:32] [Music]
[38:34] I've been set free.
[38:38] [Music]
[38:39] My God, my Savior
[38:44] has ransom
[38:46] me.
[38:49] And like a flood,
[38:54] his mercy reigns.
[38:59] Unending love.

[39:03] Amazing
[39:05] grace.
[39:09] Oh, amazing
[39:12] grace.
[39:14] How sweet
[39:16] the sound
[39:19] that saved
[39:21] a rich
[39:23] like me.
[39:28] Oh, I once
[39:30] was lost,
[39:32] but now
[39:35] I'm found.
[39:37] Was blind,
[39:39] but now
[39:42] I see.
[39:44] Oh, my chains are gone.
[39:49] I've been set free.
[39:54] My God, my Savior's
[39:59] ransom.
[40:03] [Music]
[40:24] Amen.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nice to be with you. Just a real
[40:42] honor to stand here and and once again
[40:46] and and uh just uh uh looking forward to
[40:49] what the Lord has in store today. Sure
[40:51] want to bring you greetings from brother
[40:53] Wayne Lawson and the saints back home at
[40:55] True Tabernacle there in Ohio. And uh we
[40:58] just uh we just appreciate this church,
[41:01] this ministry. We appreciate brother
[41:03] Donnie very much and just the great
[41:05] blessing he's been to our congregation
[41:07] over the years and and uh just trusting
[41:10] the Lord is blessing the dedication
[41:12] services going on over there in
[41:13] Campbellville and just honored to fill
[41:15] in. Amen. While he's uh while he's away
[41:18] I think it's always a special uh uh
[41:20] feels like a just a special privilege to
[41:23] have the trust of uh speaking somewhere
[41:26] while the pastor's away. want to be good
[41:28] stewards of that this morning and just
[41:30] uh trust that the Lord will use it to
[41:32] bless you, to help you, and encourage
[41:34] you. That's that's all that we want to
[41:35] be this morning is a help and amen. So,
[41:38] God bless you and good to be with you.
[41:40] We'll go to the word in Matthew chapter
[41:42] 6 today.
[42:03] Matthew chapter 6 26- 29.
[42:07] I'd just like to consider the lily this
[42:09] morning.
[42:24] Jesus says, "Behold the fowls of the
[42:26] air,
[42:27] for they sow not, neither do they reap,
[42:30] nor gather into barns, and yet your
[42:32] heavenly Father feedth them. Are ye not
[42:36] much better than they? Which of you by
[42:39] taking thought can add one cubit unto
[42:41] his stature? Why take ye thought for
[42:43] raignment? Consider the liies of the
[42:46] field, how they grow. They toil not,
[42:50] neither do they spin. And yet I say unto
[42:53] you that even Solomon in all his glory
[42:56] was not a raid like one of these. Amen.
[42:59] I I quite like that scripture. Amen.
[43:02] Let's uh let's just bow our heads in a
[43:04] word of prayer. Lord Jesus,
[43:07] Lord, uh every opportunity with your
[43:09] word, Lord, is an opportunity, Lord, and
[43:12] to hear your voice, Father. Lord, to
[43:15] experience your presence, Lord, to look
[43:17] upon your face. And we just ask, Lord,
[43:20] as we just brought simple, Lord, uh
[43:23] humble things, Lord, that are on our
[43:24] heart this morning, Lord, that your Holy
[43:27] Spirit would come, Father, and make it
[43:29] not a dead letter, Lord, or or or empty
[43:32] lecture, Father. But I pray Lord that
[43:35] your Holy Spirit would just inhabit this
[43:36] service. Father Lord maybe things that
[43:39] we've heard many times Lord would just
[43:41] uh Lord you would just bring an a
[43:43] special inspiration today Father that
[43:45] would make it more real than it's ever
[43:46] been before Father. It's many times Lord
[43:49] when we consider Lord the simple things
[43:51] of your creation Lord but Lord but spend
[43:54] a little time with them Lord that the
[43:55] the great profound truths Lord behind it
[43:58] is open to us Father. I just pray Lord
[44:01] that Lord as we would consider the liies
[44:03] Father we would consider the seed that's
[44:05] within us Lord Jesus. Father that we
[44:08] would just find inspiration Lord to know
[44:10] that there's a law of life at work Lord
[44:12] in every Christian heart. We just Lord
[44:14] uh we ask Lord that you would inhabit
[44:16] the service. May you anoint the lips of
[44:18] the speaker Father but also the ears of
[44:20] the hearer Lord Jesus. Have your way
[44:23] Lord and let your Holy Spirit take
[44:24] control in Jesus name. Amen. God bless
[44:28] you as you're seated today. Amen.
[44:32] Just to consider the lily today. Uh you
[44:34] know uh I think uh uh I think of a quote
[44:38] brother Brandham would use and God
[44:39] hiding himself in simplicity. It's uh I
[44:42] quite like this quote brother Brandham
[44:44] would would say in that message you know
[44:46] which is all about you know the depths
[44:48] of of of the revelation of Christ yet
[44:52] it's hid in simple things right God is
[44:54] hidden simplicity. One of the things he
[44:56] would say in that message, he would say
[44:58] he'd say that a man could sit down and
[45:00] look at a bunch of flowers, a bouquet.
[45:03] And and and he said a man could sit down
[45:05] and study that bouquet for 30 minutes if
[45:08] he and if he would do that sincerely
[45:10] with all of his heart. Brother Bram said
[45:11] he would know more about God than he did
[45:14] if he had all the degrees that a Bible
[45:16] school could offer. Amen. All the
[45:18] degrees a Bible school could give him.
[45:20] He said, "For God reveals himself in the
[45:22] flower." So just uh might might behoove
[45:25] us just for a few moments today. Amen.
[45:27] To consider the lily. Jesus has put it
[45:29] forth in the scripture as a symbol of
[45:32] the Christian. It's a symbol of one of
[45:33] God's children. Amen. We are his liies.
[45:36] We are we are flowers in his bouquet. Is
[45:38] that right? And brother Brandham would
[45:40] would speak on it many times. Uh uh uh
[45:43] as far as I'm aware, I don't think that
[45:45] it's on tape. I think it was an early
[45:47] one that he preached called Reverend Mr.
[45:49] Lily. But he would reference it a lot.
[45:50] you could tell was one of his favorite
[45:52] thoughts there on Reverend Mr. Lily. So,
[45:54] you know, the story of a of this flower,
[45:57] the story of this lily is your story and
[45:59] it's my story. The story of an
[46:00] overcoming Christian. It, you know,
[46:02] there's a uh there's a there's a there's
[46:05] a growth to the life of a Christian.
[46:06] There's a process. It starts with a it
[46:09] starts with a quickened seed, but it
[46:11] comes up into a blossom. Amen. And a
[46:13] flower has a it has a purpose. There's a
[46:16] purpose for a flower and its purpose is
[46:18] to show forth a beauty. Amen. And it and
[46:21] and and to put out a fragrance and
[46:24] there's something that comes out of the
[46:26] expression of that lily life which gives
[46:28] it meaning. It gives it worth and it
[46:30] gives it value. Is that right? Amen. So,
[46:32] you know, we just want to we just want
[46:33] to just uh kind of kind of kind of go
[46:36] with that line of thinking today. Would
[46:37] that be all right with you? Amen. Amen.
[46:39] So, you know, to start to start with the
[46:41] the the story of a lily, you start with
[46:43] a seed, right? You go down to uh there's
[46:46] a family in our church has a greenhouse.
[46:48] Quite quite an amazing operation that
[46:49] they have. And when you go down there on
[46:51] opening day in the springtime, you look
[46:53] and you see such beautiful flowers and
[46:55] just uh every different color and shape.
[46:58] And you know, these flowers are given
[46:59] out this, you know, this beautiful
[47:01] expression. It's just uh has such a
[47:04] value to it and has such a beauty. and
[47:06] you look at that flower, you begin to
[47:08] say, "Well, my goodness, you know, uh I
[47:10] I I love the beauty of this flower, but
[47:12] now what if I wanted to have that in my
[47:15] yard?" And you know, what if I wanted to
[47:16] have that in my front garden or in my
[47:18] you know, in a in a window in my house?
[47:20] And you know, how can I attain that?
[47:22] Well, you you you can't just you can't
[47:25] just uh you can't just manifest a flower
[47:27] into being. You got to start with a
[47:29] seed. Is that right? It's the same way
[47:31] it is with the Christian life. Sometimes
[47:32] a young Christian, we look at people
[47:34] around us and and they're living such a
[47:36] to such a on such a level with Christ
[47:39] and and their their their life is giving
[47:41] out such virtue and such a testimony and
[47:44] such an atmosphere and and a young
[47:45] Christian will look at that and say,
[47:46] "Well, you know, that that seems so
[47:49] unattainable. What hope do I have of of
[47:52] achieving, you know, that that level of
[47:54] the expression of a Christian life?" you
[47:56] know, how do I become that that that
[47:58] that that blossoming lily of a
[48:00] Christian, you know, that has a
[48:02] fragrance to their life and they have a
[48:03] beauty that they're putting forth? And
[48:05] it's the exact same principle. Amen. You
[48:07] you don't become that overnight. You
[48:09] don't just uh you know, uh uh you don't
[48:10] just join the church on Monday and then
[48:13] you're, you know, you're just a fully
[48:14] manifested son the next Sunday. Amen.
[48:17] You you uh you got to start with a seed.
[48:19] Amen. But but there's a something
[48:21] beautiful in that is that all all true
[48:24] lilies and all fully manifested liies
[48:27] started in the humility of a seed. Amen.
[48:29] And God puts something in a seed. Amen.
[48:32] That that uh that will guide it to its
[48:35] full destiny and its full expression.
[48:37] Getting ahead of myself today, but but
[48:39] you got to start with a seed, friends.
[48:40] And you know, that's why we we minister
[48:43] on the quickening power. Amen. Uh how
[48:45] many believe that this message is still
[48:47] full of quickening power? I know that a
[48:49] lot of people you know have uh
[48:50] intellectualized it over the years there
[48:53] uh traditions of men have come and you
[48:55] know and taken the moving the spirit out
[48:57] of the church and given us a form and
[49:00] you know uh uh a lot of people become
[49:02] cold and formal and lukewarm and starchy
[49:05] and powerless with this message. But I
[49:07] believe as long as the message amen is
[49:09] is on this earth and as long as the
[49:11] people that believe it are on this earth
[49:13] amen we've got to have quickening power
[49:15] moving in the church of the living God.
[49:17] Amen. And the reason I believe that is
[49:19] not so that we can, you know, just
[49:21] gather together and have a big noisy
[49:23] service and the preacher can feel like
[49:24] he really preached something because
[49:25] everybody's excited. Amen. I believe
[49:27] that because I believe that uh it takes
[49:30] quickening power to make a seed live.
[49:32] Amen. It takes quickening power to make
[49:34] a seed live. Because a seed, you know,
[49:36] you may think uh because a seed, you
[49:38] know, think of a think of an acorn or,
[49:40] you know, any kind of a a tree seed. Uh,
[49:43] that seed isn't born to life when it
[49:45] falls from the branch of its parentage.
[49:47] Amen. Amen. An aorn isn't born when it
[49:50] falls off the oak tree. That's not the
[49:52] birth. Amen. Amen. But sometimes it'll
[49:54] fall from where it came from. It'll fall
[49:56] from its parent tree. Amen. And it might
[49:59] lay in a dormant condition for a long
[50:01] long time. Sometimes years. Amen. And uh
[50:04] it it could lay there just as dead as it
[50:07] could be. No life in it. No ability to
[50:09] express itself. Amen. But it takes a
[50:11] moment. Amen. A quickening. It takes a a
[50:14] from that time moment. And that's the
[50:16] way it's got to be for every born again
[50:18] son or daughter of God. Amen. We've had
[50:20] our experience, but for our young
[50:22] people, it has to be the same thing.
[50:23] It's not because they join a church.
[50:25] It's not cuz they believe God sent a
[50:27] prophet. It's not about the way you
[50:28] dress. It's not about the lifestyle that
[50:30] you follow. Amen. It takes quickening
[50:32] power, amen, to take a intellectual
[50:34] message believer and make them a message
[50:36] liver and a message manifesttor. Amen.
[50:39] Amen. If you're you see uh because
[50:42] that's when a seed is born is when it's
[50:43] quickened. Amen. Something has to
[50:45] germinate. Something has to happen.
[50:47] Amen. Amen. And everything else about
[50:50] that seed. When you look at a seed,
[50:51] you're looking at the outward things,
[50:54] you know, the outward appearance of a
[50:55] seed. What you're looking at is just a
[50:57] dead husk which is eventually going to
[50:59] rot away. Is that right? All of that is
[51:02] just, you know, those are that's just
[51:03] the conditions. That's just the
[51:05] circumstances and the, you know, and and
[51:07] the uh and the nutrients which are which
[51:09] are put around that seed. Amen. To give
[51:11] it what it needs, amen, to be quickened
[51:14] and then it'll begin to grow. Amen. And
[51:16] that's why we come to church on Sunday
[51:17] morning. We sing songs and we worship
[51:19] the Lord. We fellowship with one
[51:21] another. We build buildings. We we have
[51:23] programs and we preach sermons and we do
[51:25] all these kind of things. But without a
[51:28] life at the core of that, Amen. without
[51:30] uh quickening power. Amen. In that
[51:33] tabernacle, it's a husk. Amen. It's it's
[51:35] just dead religion. Amen. Amen. And so,
[51:38] you know, I if you're uh Amen. that
[51:41] that's the only uh that's the only
[51:43] prescription. Amen. That's the only way
[51:45] today. Amen. You see, brother Bram would
[51:47] say uh he would he would tell us that no
[51:49] matter how good a seed looks, he said
[51:51] the only question of a seed is whether
[51:52] it's been germatized. Amen. If it's not
[51:55] germatized, it'll rot and it'll lay
[51:57] there. And I Yeah, I like how he said he
[51:59] said it's no matter how good you are,
[52:00] how much of a deacon, preacher, pastor,
[52:02] teacher, Sunday school person, whoever
[52:04] you are, no matter how loud you shouted,
[52:06] no matter how you've danced or whatever
[52:08] you've done, and how many missionaries
[52:10] you sent to the field or when you die,
[52:12] he said when you die, you're dead if the
[52:14] Holy Spirit isn't there to raise you up.
[52:16] If your spirit hasn't been changed into
[52:19] that person of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[52:21] But you know, just to turn that around
[52:23] this morning then to think, Amen. You
[52:25] might not be the best pre- Christian
[52:26] there is. You might not be the best
[52:28] church member. You might not look like
[52:30] the best preacher or the best believer
[52:31] or the, you know, the best dressed one
[52:33] in the church. You may not have the best
[52:34] gifts and talents and amen. Uh whatever
[52:37] it is, it might not look like uh from
[52:39] the outside you might not look like
[52:41] much. But but the thing is if you've
[52:42] been germatized, amen, if you've ever
[52:44] been quickened, if you ever been
[52:46] baptized with the Holy Ghost, Amen. then
[52:48] it looses something on the inside of
[52:50] you. Amen. that will go that from that
[52:52] time it'll begin to grow. It'll begin to
[52:55] advance. Amen. It'll begin to push out.
[52:57] And it does that all on its own. Amen.
[52:59] Because it's a seed. Amen. And I I I
[53:02] believe uh I believe the message of the
[53:04] hour in that way. I believe this message
[53:06] is so full of power. Amen. That it can
[53:08] still Amen. bring forth Holy Ghost
[53:10] baptized children in the church of the
[53:12] living God. I believe I believe it's
[53:14] still so full of power. Amen. that the
[53:16] Holy Ghost can come down on Sunday
[53:17] morning and begin to walk the aisles and
[53:19] move on needs and perform miracles and
[53:22] heal the sick and deliver the bound and
[53:24] do all of those kind of things. Amen. I
[53:26] know that a lot of people have uh have
[53:28] taken the message and and and and they
[53:30] kind of got the idea that we've come so
[53:31] far and that we know so much that now
[53:34] we're a mature church and and we no
[53:36] longer need, you know, the the
[53:37] manifestation of the spirit because that
[53:40] was all for that's just for the
[53:41] Pentecostals and that's for that's for
[53:43] Pentecostal babies and we're mature,
[53:45] brother Nathan. But, you know, I believe
[53:47] if you look at a tree or look at a
[53:49] flower, Amen. that a mature plant is not
[53:52] a plant which is fallen down and dried
[53:55] up and just just no life in it and you
[53:58] know and and and and and just laying
[53:59] over in a corner somewhere. A mature
[54:02] tree is a tree which has come to the
[54:04] point, Amen, where it's able to
[54:06] reproduce life. Amen. That that that
[54:09] runs a lot deeper than I'm preaching to
[54:10] this morning. But I believe I believe
[54:12] we're a mature bride. I believe we we're
[54:15] under a mature message in a mature
[54:17] season. Amen. But brother Brandham said
[54:19] that maturity would be full maturity
[54:21] with full power. Amen. Amen. And I
[54:23] believe, Amen. If if this message, Amen,
[54:26] doesn't still have in it the ability to
[54:28] bring forth children. Amen. And
[54:30] reproduce new life, if it doesn't bring
[54:32] life to the next generation, amen. Then
[54:34] whatever our idea of the message is, we
[54:36] need to throw it out and get back to the
[54:38] quickening power. Amen. I believe in
[54:40] quickening power. Amen. That'll not only
[54:42] birth a seed, but it'll bring it up
[54:44] higher than it is. Amen. It'll cause
[54:46] that seed to grow. It'll cause that seed
[54:48] to bring forth. Amen. Amen. We brother
[54:52] would say if we get them to church,
[54:53] that's good. But we got to get them
[54:55] Amen. past the church and get them to
[54:57] Christ. He said, where there's
[54:59] quickening power. Amen. Where there's
[55:01] quickening power. And I believe Amen. I
[55:04] believe uh I believe that's where we're
[55:05] to be. We ought to be a church that's
[55:07] able to reproduce the original seed, the
[55:11] original church, that original book of
[55:13] Acts. Amen. That original life. Brother
[55:16] Brandham would say, I'm I'm just laying
[55:18] kind of a foundation here. And then just
[55:20] bear with me for a little bit. Brother
[55:22] Brandham in the rising of the sun there,
[55:23] he would say he he would he would
[55:25] challenge even his own church. And Amen.
[55:27] I think it's a worthy question for any
[55:29] for any believer. He would say, "Is
[55:31] there somebody here who doesn't have
[55:33] this quickening power in you where the
[55:36] sun has shined across?" He said, "Now
[55:38] you might have," he said, "you might
[55:39] have sat in this tabernacle. You've
[55:41] listened to tapes and yet the spirit has
[55:44] never quickened you to follow the word
[55:46] of God. He said that is a dangerous
[55:48] thing. That's a dangerous thing, brother
[55:50] sister. Cuz you know it's real easy to
[55:52] join a church and be part of the
[55:54] movement and dress the part and you know
[55:56] rub shoulders with a with a with a group
[55:58] of people. Amen. And and feel a sense of
[56:01] belonging and feel a sense of identity
[56:03] because of uh because of the church that
[56:05] we associate with and still be a dead
[56:07] seed. Brother Brandon say, "The greatest
[56:09] deception is for somebody to think
[56:11] they're a Christian and not be." Amen.
[56:13] Well, you know that, but there's a lot
[56:14] of people who think they're a Christian
[56:16] because they can quote some quotes. And
[56:18] they think they're a Christian cuz they
[56:19] dress better than somebody else. Or,
[56:21] Amen. think they're a Christian cuz, you
[56:23] know, they got better doctrine than a
[56:24] Pentecost or think they're a Christian
[56:26] because they got freer worship than a
[56:28] Baptist. Or, you know, think they're a
[56:30] Christian, Amen, because of all of the
[56:32] outward husk of our Christianity. Amen.
[56:34] Amen. But a real Christian is somebody
[56:37] who's got a life. Amen. A power, a
[56:39] quickening on the inside. Amen. Who can
[56:42] take the word and then they can follow
[56:43] it. Amen. Not just believe it, but
[56:45] follow it and manifest it. Amen. And
[56:48] bring it to pass. Brother say it was a
[56:50] dangerous thing. What if you would be a
[56:52] dead seed with no life in you? Oh, it's
[56:55] dangerous. He said, "But but there's
[56:57] something in you." Oh, I love this.
[56:59] There's something in you that tells you,
[57:02] I want to rise this morning.
[57:05] I want to rise this morning. I want to
[57:07] rise from the state that I'm in. I don't
[57:09] want to just be a dead seed and be left
[57:11] to dirt and driftwood. I want to rise.
[57:15] Amen. Now, brothers and sisters, I I
[57:17] don't know where everybody's at this
[57:19] morning, but there might be somebody in
[57:20] the house of God today. Amen. And you
[57:22] you might come and you might have come
[57:24] to church today and your your life's in
[57:26] a mess and you're really not in a good
[57:28] place spiritually. And Amen. You might
[57:30] you might be way below living way below
[57:32] where you're supposed to be living.
[57:33] Amen. and and and uh and and and feeling
[57:36] just so much condemnation on you. Amen.
[57:38] Just feeling so much pressure. Amen.
[57:40] Because of just where you're at in in
[57:42] your Christian walk. But but let let's
[57:44] look a little deeper than that this
[57:46] morning. Amen. Is there something under
[57:47] all of your struggles, under all your
[57:49] weaknesses, under all of the things that
[57:51] you're pushing through? Is there a
[57:53] little voice on the inside of you, just
[57:55] a little still small voice? Amen.
[57:57] Something in you saying, "I want to
[57:59] rise. I don't I don't want to live here,
[58:02] Brother Nathan. I don't want to. This
[58:03] isn't uh I don't believe this is where I
[58:05] was who I was meant to be and what I was
[58:07] meant to do. I don't know how to get a
[58:09] little higher with God, but something in
[58:10] me is telling me and pushing me and
[58:13] pulling me and saying and saying I want
[58:15] to rise. I want to come up a little
[58:17] higher in the Amen. I I want to see
[58:19] Amen. Uh I want to live in higher
[58:21] heights. Amen. I want to be more than I
[58:24] am. Brother, if you got that little
[58:26] voice inside of you, you might feel like
[58:28] the weakest Christian in the church.
[58:29] Amen. But if you got that little voice,
[58:31] you ought to thank the Lord today. Amen.
[58:33] Cuz if you got a little voice of a seed
[58:35] on the inside of you saying, "I want to
[58:37] rise." Brother, you got power. Amen.
[58:40] It's power. You say, "Brother Nathan,
[58:42] but but my I have no power in my
[58:44] Christian walk." Amen. But I'm talking
[58:45] about a different kind of power. Amen.
[58:47] There's so much power in the word of
[58:48] God. We could preach on power to
[58:50] overcome, power to heal, power to
[58:53] perform miracles, power for signs and
[58:55] wonders. Amen. Power, Amen. power to
[58:57] speak in tongues and power to do this
[58:59] and power to Amen. the Amen. The word is
[59:01] full of power. But I want to preach on a
[59:03] very special kind of power. And I might
[59:05] be so bold today to today to say this is
[59:08] the most important kind of power a
[59:10] Christian has. Amen. It's power to
[59:13] become. That's the power of a seed. It's
[59:16] got power to become. Amen. There's a
[59:18] power in a seed that no matter what it
[59:20] looks like today, Amen. next year it's
[59:23] not going to look the same. Amen. It's
[59:25] got power in it to become more than it
[59:27] thinks is possible. There's power in you
[59:30] to become more than you ever imagined.
[59:32] To experience more than you thought was
[59:33] possible, to be more of a have more of a
[59:36] Christian life than you thought you had
[59:37] access to. It's power to become. Amen.
[59:41] Amen. There's see something in you
[59:43] wanting to rise that shows there's a
[59:45] seed in there. Amen. And so and and that
[59:48] and the thing is if you got a seed of
[59:51] predestination in you, there's a law in
[59:54] that seed. How many know that? That a
[59:56] seed, naturally speaking, a seed is the
[59:59] encapsulation of a law of God. Amen.
[1:00:03] When you look at a seed, you're looking
[1:00:04] at something that just uh it just
[1:00:06] contains a law of God. Now, we're
[1:00:09] talking about a law today. Amen. This in
[1:00:11] other words, it's something God set into
[1:00:13] motion. It's not a hope so or a might
[1:00:16] be. It's a must be. It's a law. Amen. A
[1:00:19] scriptural law. How many know in
[1:00:21] Genesis? Amen. He created the heavens
[1:00:23] and the earth. Amen. And then uh and
[1:00:25] then he put a law into motion. He he he
[1:00:28] remember brother Graham said he put the
[1:00:29] seeds of creation into the earth. And
[1:00:31] everything that he wanted to have life,
[1:00:33] he would put the seeds of that life in
[1:00:34] the earth. Amen. Amen. Now, now uh and
[1:00:38] but when he planted those seeds, he put
[1:00:40] a law in that seed. He said, "Let every
[1:00:42] seed bring forth of its own kind." Let
[1:00:46] every seed bring forth of its own kind.
[1:00:49] Now, that's a law. Amen. That's a law.
[1:00:52] You ready for a little deep teaching
[1:00:53] this morning?
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Ever since God put this law into place,
[1:00:57] a cat has never had puppies.
[1:01:01] Anybody ever seen it? Anybody ever seen
[1:01:04] a dog have kittens? It's never happened.
[1:01:07] Amen. Because it's a it's a law of God.
[1:01:10] He put it right into the nature and the
[1:01:12] makeup, amen, of a seed. Amen. That when
[1:01:15] a seed is planted, there's already a
[1:01:17] potential in that seed. Amen. That it
[1:01:19] can become a and express the life that
[1:01:22] it came from. It doesn't have to try to
[1:01:24] do that. It doesn't hope to become that.
[1:01:27] Amen. It must be that because it's a law
[1:01:30] of Genesis. It's the law of the seed.
[1:01:32] Amen. And now the law of the seed, it's
[1:01:34] a very simple principle, but it runs
[1:01:36] very, very deep. And you know, you can
[1:01:38] sp God's things that God's simple truths
[1:01:40] are are so profound. They're simple on
[1:01:42] the surface and they're profound when we
[1:01:44] begin to dig into them. But you know,
[1:01:46] you can study a lot on how a seed works
[1:01:48] and and they do today. There's never
[1:01:50] been a time when our agriculture and the
[1:01:52] growing of our food was more scientific
[1:01:54] and more advanced. And you look at the
[1:01:56] technology that they have and you know
[1:01:58] they go in a lab somewhere with a little
[1:01:59] seed and they they unwrap the gene of
[1:02:01] that seed and they can you know they can
[1:02:03] they can mess around with chemicals and
[1:02:05] nutrients and and fertilization and amen
[1:02:08] and and environment and they can do
[1:02:10] everything and there's so much study
[1:02:11] that you can put into it. There's so
[1:02:13] much you know you can learn. There's so
[1:02:15] much you can you can uh you can uh wrap
[1:02:17] your mind around this process of a seed.
[1:02:20] But you know, at the end of the day,
[1:02:22] brother, sister, as scientific as it is
[1:02:24] and and as advanced as it is, Amen. and
[1:02:26] as intellectual as it's become, at the
[1:02:29] end of the day, a farmer goes out in the
[1:02:31] field, he puts a seed in the dirt, and
[1:02:32] he lets God's law happen. Amen. Because
[1:02:35] at the end of the day, there's something
[1:02:36] beyond human control. There's something
[1:02:38] beyond human ex understanding. Amen.
[1:02:41] Something beyond comprehension. It's the
[1:02:44] law of life that God put in a seed.
[1:02:46] Amen. That it doesn't need your help to
[1:02:48] become what it's supposed to be. And
[1:02:50] then you can't tamper with it. Amen. You
[1:02:52] can't come reach down and pluck a
[1:02:54] blossom out of a lily seed. It's got to
[1:02:56] follow God's law. It's got to go through
[1:02:58] his process. It's got to grow. Amen.
[1:03:01] Hallelujah. Amen. It's only the life
[1:03:04] that's in the seed that can make it
[1:03:06] blossom. Amen. Yeah. And and uh Brother
[1:03:09] Bam would teach this and God's power to
[1:03:11] transform. Let's listen. Listen close to
[1:03:13] this quote here. Brother Brham said when
[1:03:15] he put the seed in the earth, the seed
[1:03:17] can only come forth with the power of
[1:03:20] life in it. I love that. The power of
[1:03:23] life to transform it from a seed to a
[1:03:26] plant or whatever it was. His
[1:03:28] transforming power. Now God put the So
[1:03:32] what is God's power to transform? It's
[1:03:34] the power of a seed. Amen. And he said,
[1:03:37] "Now God put the seed in there with
[1:03:40] potentials that it would be what he said
[1:03:42] it would be." Amen. And as long as it
[1:03:45] stayed in its right category, it would
[1:03:47] be just exactly what God said it would
[1:03:49] be because he made it that way. And he
[1:03:51] made a channel. Brother Bram said that
[1:03:53] anything that stays in his channel or
[1:03:56] follows his law in his line of word, it
[1:03:59] will have to bring forth exactly like
[1:04:02] his word said it would do. Hallelujah.
[1:04:04] And brother Bram said, see, God planted
[1:04:06] those seeds and then God said, "It's all
[1:04:08] good. It's all good. I'll just rest." I
[1:04:11] tell you what, God's resting today.
[1:04:13] God's not worried about it. He said,
[1:04:15] "It's all good and I'll just rest
[1:04:17] because each one of those seeds has
[1:04:20] power in itself." Amen. To transform
[1:04:24] itself into the species that I desire it
[1:04:27] to be. That's what it must be because I
[1:04:30] have given to every seed. How many
[1:04:32] believe you're a seed of God today? He
[1:04:34] said, "I have given every seed
[1:04:36] transforming power." Amen. to make out
[1:04:39] of itself in its potentials to make of
[1:04:42] it exactly what I want it to be.
[1:04:45] Hallelujah. You say, "Brother Nathan, I
[1:04:47] need that transforming power today. I
[1:04:49] I'm sick and I need my body transformed.
[1:04:52] I I I need my I need my mind
[1:04:54] transformed. I need my attitude
[1:04:56] transformed." Hallelujah. Amen. I I need
[1:04:58] transforming power. Amen. Cuz I'm living
[1:05:01] here and I want to live here and I need
[1:05:03] a transformation in my life. Amen. Don't
[1:05:05] look a million miles away in outer
[1:05:07] space. Amen. for the power that you're
[1:05:09] looking for. It's not on the other side
[1:05:11] of the sea. Amen. When God, Amen,
[1:05:13] predestinated you to be a child of God.
[1:05:16] Amen. He planted a seed in you. And the
[1:05:18] power that you need to become what God
[1:05:20] wanted you to be is already in you.
[1:05:23] Amen. There's a law of life in the seed
[1:05:26] of election. Amen. He isn't worried
[1:05:29] about it. God is resting on what he
[1:05:32] already planted.
[1:05:35] Hallelujah.
[1:05:37] Amen. See, God didn't gain confidence in
[1:05:39] you as this child. Amen. When you went
[1:05:41] to the altar and knelt down to pray. God
[1:05:44] didn't get confidence in you the day you
[1:05:45] got the Holy Ghost. God didn't get gain
[1:05:48] his confidence in you. Amen. When you
[1:05:49] made a decision for the Lord or Amen or
[1:05:52] or or when you joined the right church.
[1:05:54] God has had confidence in you. Amen.
[1:05:56] Since he carried you in his mind in seed
[1:05:59] form before the foundation of the world,
[1:06:01] God trusts his own law. Amen. We got to
[1:06:04] trust it, too. You can trust that seed.
[1:06:07] Amen. God put the power in it.
[1:06:09] Transforming power to make itself what
[1:06:11] he wanted it to be. Amen. God's already
[1:06:14] provided the power. The Bible said,
[1:06:17] Amen. As many as believed on him and
[1:06:19] received him, to them gave he power to
[1:06:22] become the sons of God. Amen. Even to
[1:06:26] them that believe on his name. Amen.
[1:06:28] That's God's law. That's God's See,
[1:06:30] that's God's program. Amen. Is life
[1:06:32] begets life. There's a there's a channel
[1:06:35] to it. There's a cycle to it. Amen. You
[1:06:38] know, we could stop and and preach here
[1:06:39] a long time. Amen. We won't today, but
[1:06:42] just to think of that of that process.
[1:06:44] Amen. Of reproduction, Amen. of of life,
[1:06:47] beginning life, of a seed line coming
[1:06:49] down through generations. Amen. That's a
[1:06:52] that's a there's a great focus on that
[1:06:54] in the word of God. You can look at the
[1:06:55] Old Testament and the great focus that
[1:06:57] that they put on the rituals around
[1:06:59] reproduction. Amen. You you can think
[1:07:02] about think about to a Christian the
[1:07:03] sanctity of a marriage vow. Amen. And
[1:07:06] just the the terrible shame and Amen.
[1:07:08] the terrible stigma. Amen. Around
[1:07:10] infidelity and around, you know, being
[1:07:12] promised to this one and running with
[1:07:14] that one. Amen. What that means to a
[1:07:15] Christian. What a wicked thing it is.
[1:07:18] Amen. To be unfaithful. Amen. To the one
[1:07:20] God has placed you with. Amen. You you
[1:07:22] see some people today, they think, well,
[1:07:24] all of those things, that's just some
[1:07:25] man trying to control me and that's
[1:07:27] just, you know, that's just some church
[1:07:29] trying to tell me what to do and keep me
[1:07:30] away from things that feel good or, you
[1:07:33] know, thing things I want to do. Amen.
[1:07:35] But it's a lot deeper than that,
[1:07:36] friends. Amen. This seed line is very,
[1:07:39] very important to God. It's very
[1:07:41] important to God. Amen. Even so much
[1:07:43] that that your great great great
[1:07:45] grandfather would have angels escorting
[1:07:47] him on the battlefield. He he would be
[1:07:50] fighting a war somewhere. Amen. But
[1:07:51] God's angels would escort that seed.
[1:07:54] Amen. So that it wouldn't come to an
[1:07:55] untimely end. Amen. Because God had to
[1:07:58] bring this one to this one and this one
[1:07:59] to this one. Amen. And bring it down
[1:08:01] generation to generation. Amen. See,
[1:08:03] God's got a purpose. God's got a plan.
[1:08:06] God's got something he's trying to bring
[1:08:08] forth. Amen. So, see, God's God cares
[1:08:11] about the seed. Amen. And he cares about
[1:08:14] preserving that life. And and all of
[1:08:16] these things are about the preservation
[1:08:18] and the propagation of life. Amen. The
[1:08:21] protection of life. Amen. That's that's
[1:08:24] see that's the kind of God who's
[1:08:26] watching over this message and the and
[1:08:28] its believers. Brother would often quote
[1:08:31] the scripture in Isaiah. I the Lord do
[1:08:33] keep it and I will water it every moment
[1:08:36] lest any heard it. I will keep it night
[1:08:39] and day. Amen. You somebody came to
[1:08:42] brother Brand. Brother Bran would always
[1:08:43] quote it this way. He would say, "I the
[1:08:45] Lord planted it before the foundation of
[1:08:46] the world and I'll water it." Amen. lest
[1:08:49] anybody should pluck it from my hand.
[1:08:52] Amen. You can see he's putting you right
[1:08:53] in that scripture. One of God's seed is
[1:08:55] one of his sheep. Somebody will come to
[1:08:57] say, "Brother Brandon, how how is it
[1:08:59] that there's anybody that believes your
[1:09:01] message? How h how h how do you have
[1:09:03] anybody to listen to you?" He said,
[1:09:04] "Because I can see why people listen to
[1:09:06] Billy Graham because he's got all the
[1:09:08] denominations in support of him." And
[1:09:10] Oral Roberts, every Pentecostal hangs
[1:09:12] with Oral Roberts, he said. But brother
[1:09:14] Brandham said, "You're against the whole
[1:09:16] thing. You're against all these
[1:09:17] organizations. You're against all these
[1:09:19] power structures and and systems. So,
[1:09:22] how in the world do you ever get
[1:09:23] anybody? Brother Bam said, "It's God.
[1:09:25] It's God. I the Lord planted it. I'll
[1:09:28] water it. I'll plant it. I put their
[1:09:30] names on the book before the foundation
[1:09:31] of the world by predestination. I'll
[1:09:33] water it." He said, "Just keep on
[1:09:35] moving." Amen. I believe, brother,
[1:09:37] brother, sister, that if God planted a
[1:09:39] message, Amen. He already had somebody
[1:09:41] in mind, amen, to receive that water, to
[1:09:44] receive that light. God's got seed in
[1:09:46] this day. Amen. It's not any powers of
[1:09:49] men or our ability to organize or our
[1:09:51] ability to, you know, to make programs
[1:09:53] that's carrying this message forward.
[1:09:55] Amen. But the husband men, amen, the the
[1:09:58] great gardener of heaven, amen, is is
[1:10:00] looking after the vine. Amen. And he
[1:10:02] said, "And now, if this vine ever
[1:10:04] succeeds to grow, amen, if it's ever
[1:10:06] able to put forth, Amen. If he if I take
[1:10:09] care of my vine, if I water it, Amen. If
[1:10:12] I put light on it, they'll write another
[1:10:14] book of Acts behind it." Hallelujah.
[1:10:16] Amen. I believe, amen, that uh we got to
[1:10:19] just go on with the message cuz there's
[1:10:21] a seed life that's in the message. I'm
[1:10:24] not worried about whether we're going to
[1:10:25] make a rapture. I'm not worried about
[1:10:26] whether we'll see adopted sons. I'm not
[1:10:28] worried about power. Amen. And authority
[1:10:31] and manifestation. It's already in the
[1:10:34] seed.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; It's already in the message.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; You just need somebody to believe it.
[1:10:39] Let's just say it simply like this. When
[1:10:42] God plants a seed, God expects a
[1:10:44] blossom.
[1:10:45] He's not he's not worried about whether
[1:10:47] it'll come forth. He's already expecting
[1:10:49] a blossom when he plants the seed.
[1:10:51] Isaiah 55 says as the rain comes down
[1:10:54] and it gives seed and bread. Amen. Amen.
[1:10:57] Seed and bread. Remember it said the
[1:10:59] rain comes it gives seed to the sewer
[1:11:01] and bread to the eater. Now the
[1:11:04] beautiful thing about this there's a
[1:11:05] there is a process involved in seed
[1:11:08] becoming bread. Amen. But it all comes
[1:11:10] by the same rain. Hallelujah. And there
[1:11:14] is a process involved. Amen. From Amen.
[1:11:16] From taking a holy ghostborn, Amen.
[1:11:18] quicken seed of God and then bringing
[1:11:20] them to the place of an adopted son.
[1:11:22] There's a process, but it comes by the
[1:11:24] same reign. Amen. And brother, brother,
[1:11:27] sister, we got a message that's the
[1:11:29] former and the latter reign together. We
[1:11:30] got enough power in this message, amen,
[1:11:32] to get somebody born again, amen, to
[1:11:34] fill them with the Holy Ghost. And
[1:11:36] enough power to take a Holy Ghostborn
[1:11:37] son of God and make them more than a
[1:11:39] Pentecostal baby. Amen. But bring them
[1:11:41] up to a capstone life. Amen. Where they
[1:11:43] can express the life that they came
[1:11:45] from. Hallelujah. This ain't a time for
[1:11:47] little twig Christians, little sprout
[1:11:50] Christians. We're living in the blossom.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said that's that's the way my
[1:11:56] word is. It shall not return to me void,
[1:11:59] but it shall accomplish that which I
[1:12:01] please, and it shall prosper in the
[1:12:04] thing whereto I sent it. Amen. I I
[1:12:08] believe we receive a message of
[1:12:09] adoption. Amen. And so if God would send
[1:12:11] a message of adoption, God's expecting
[1:12:13] manifested sons, manifested daughters.
[1:12:17] Amen. A mature church with full maturity
[1:12:20] and full power. Amen. You and that's
[1:12:23] where but you know that's where the
[1:12:24] intimidation comes in for a lot of our
[1:12:27] young Christians. You know, uh uh some
[1:12:30] of us were we're young in the Lord. We
[1:12:33] we weren't there in 1963.
[1:12:36] We weren't there in 1977 yet. We weren't
[1:12:38] we, you know, some of us are young in
[1:12:40] the Lord and we're early on in our
[1:12:42] journey, you know, and so you know what
[1:12:45] happens as a young person or a young
[1:12:46] Christian, amen, they'll say, "Well,
[1:12:48] brother Nathan, I see the great call of
[1:12:50] the hour. I I listen to brother
[1:12:51] Brandham. I listen to the message and I
[1:12:53] see I see this great image, amen, that
[1:12:56] that is presented of a bouquet of
[1:12:59] overcoming Christians, amen, with such
[1:13:02] power and such maturity and such
[1:13:04] manifestation." I hear brother Bram say
[1:13:06] that this bride would be an invincible
[1:13:08] army, that she would do the greater
[1:13:10] works, that she'd be a sinless, virtuous
[1:13:12] bride, and that, you know, and all these
[1:13:14] great things that are spoken about the
[1:13:16] bride. And I'm looking at myself,
[1:13:17] Brother Nathan, and I feel like I I've
[1:13:19] only got Amen. I just only have a little
[1:13:22] Jesus. And I don't I, you know, I I I
[1:13:25] know I know, Brother Donnie, you know, I
[1:13:27] I I know he's a manifested son. And you
[1:13:30] know, I I know I know this one. Brother
[1:13:32] Daryl, you know, he's a manifested son.
[1:13:34] And I'm looking at this one and that one
[1:13:35] and I see that virtue coming from their
[1:13:37] life. And you know, I see them walking
[1:13:39] in the hour, you know, in the light of
[1:13:41] the hour and and doing what they're
[1:13:43] supposed to do. And I'm looking to
[1:13:44] myself, brother Nathan, I just don't got
[1:13:46] enough. I've only got a little Jesus.
[1:13:49] Amen. But you know what? Little Jesus.
[1:13:51] Amen. Little Jesus. Little Jesus could
[1:13:54] take all that Jesus. Little Jesus could
[1:13:56] go down to church on Sunday morning and
[1:13:58] he could sit around with a bunch of
[1:14:00] theologians and a bunch of doctors of
[1:14:01] divinity and he could wrap him in
[1:14:03] circles just by just by being little
[1:14:05] Jesus just on the grounds of who he was,
[1:14:09] just on the grounds of the life that was
[1:14:10] in him. Don't ever underestimate little
[1:14:12] Jesus. Cuz if all you got is a little
[1:14:14] Jesus today, let me tell you something.
[1:14:16] Little Jesus was still Jehovah Jesus.
[1:14:19] And little Jesus, just a little Jesus in
[1:14:21] you is still a healer. It's healer
[1:14:23] Jesus. It's victory, Jesus. It's peace,
[1:14:26] Jesus. It's It's overcoming Jesus. Amen.
[1:14:30] But the thing about little Jesus, little
[1:14:31] Jesus don't stay little.
[1:14:34] Amen. Brother said, "When a man gets
[1:14:37] saved, a little bit of light, Amen. Just
[1:14:40] a little bit of light." He said, "Just
[1:14:41] the size of a button on your shirt."
[1:14:43] Just that much light comes into a man
[1:14:46] when he's saved, when he's born again.
[1:14:48] Just a little button of light like that.
[1:14:50] Amen. Just a little seed of light. Amen.
[1:14:52] And you look friends, you're not the
[1:14:54] fullness of the Godhead bodily. Amen.
[1:14:56] But when you got the Holy Ghost, Amen.
[1:14:58] Brother Brand said, a little lick of
[1:14:59] fire off of that pillar of fire. Amen.
[1:15:02] Just a a little flame off the Godhead.
[1:15:05] Amen. A little spark came out of that
[1:15:07] logos and it inhabited your life, came
[1:15:10] into your heart. Amen. Just a little
[1:15:12] button of light. That's all that it is.
[1:15:15] But it won't stay little. Brother Graham
[1:15:17] said that little light, it'll begin to
[1:15:18] grow. Amen. It begins to grow and it
[1:15:20] begins to expand. And from that time,
[1:15:22] it'll begin to push out. And all of a
[1:15:24] sudden, that little light that's in you
[1:15:26] starts pressing against the darkness
[1:15:27] that's in your flesh. Amen. And that
[1:15:30] little bit of light starts pushing this
[1:15:31] way and pushing all of a sudden it
[1:15:33] starts pushing on your bad attitude and
[1:15:35] it starts pushing on your depression and
[1:15:37] pushing on those worldly pleasures and
[1:15:39] pushing down entertainment. Amen. That's
[1:15:41] Amen. Why? Cuz it's a seed. And if a
[1:15:44] seed Amen. If it's a true seed, all it
[1:15:47] needs is time and atmosphere and it'll
[1:15:49] grow.
[1:15:50] Say, "Brother Nathan, I only got a
[1:15:52] little Jesus." I'll tell you what to do
[1:15:53] with little Jesus. Don't sit home in
[1:15:55] your pajamas. Get down to the church on
[1:15:57] Sunday morning and get in an atmosphere
[1:15:59] of believing Christians. Amen. Amen. And
[1:16:01] let the Holy Spirit move as licks of
[1:16:04] fire come together. Put it in an
[1:16:05] atmosphere. Feed it the message of the
[1:16:08] hour. And little Jesus won't stay
[1:16:09] little. It'll start to grow.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said it'll keep growing,
[1:16:15] growing, growing. It'll start crowding
[1:16:17] out unbelief. Amen. That's what you got
[1:16:19] to do. Amen. That's Look, that's what
[1:16:22] our young people need is not a 12step
[1:16:24] plan. Amen. But get them the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:27] Amen. And then feed that experience so
[1:16:29] that it begins to grow. Amen. You know,
[1:16:32] I I had an old house. A house I used to
[1:16:34] live in was in right in the middle of
[1:16:36] town, just a little yard, and it had a
[1:16:38] had an ugly old fence around it. Brother
[1:16:40] Josiah, it was just a just a terrible
[1:16:43] the fence was just falling apart, and I
[1:16:45] didn't really want to get a new fence
[1:16:46] cuz fences ain't cheap. And so, so I
[1:16:50] thought I had this bright idea. What
[1:16:51] I'll do is I'll I'll go down I'll get
[1:16:53] some kind of a flowering vine and uh and
[1:16:56] I'll take that flowering vine. I'll
[1:16:58] plant it all along that fence and it'll
[1:16:59] fill up the fence and it'll hide all the
[1:17:00] broken places and and you know that oh
[1:17:03] that'll be beautiful. You know that that
[1:17:04] that'll be the ticket. So I went down I
[1:17:07] went down to Menard's. Bless the Lord.
[1:17:09] And uh and I found I found a a seed of a
[1:17:13] little plant called morning glory. I
[1:17:15] thought I like the sound of that.
[1:17:18] Morning glory. Well, okay, that'll work.
[1:17:20] And I saw it was a flowering vine. So, I
[1:17:22] went home. If any of you are gardeners,
[1:17:24] you're going to laugh right now. Uh but
[1:17:26] but on the back of that packet, it said,
[1:17:28] "Take one seed and put it every 6 in."
[1:17:30] And I thought, I bought tons of this
[1:17:32] stuff. So, I took that seed, man, and I
[1:17:35] scattered it just every inch all the way
[1:17:37] down along my fence cuz I really wanted
[1:17:39] to hide that fence. And you know,
[1:17:41] nothing happened right that day. And the
[1:17:44] next week, you couldn't tell the
[1:17:45] difference. Amen. But but after a season
[1:17:48] and after a time, Amen. All of a sudden,
[1:17:50] here that morning glory starts coming
[1:17:52] forth and it starts pushing out and it
[1:17:54] started and you know just in no time
[1:17:56] that stuff filled up that whole fence
[1:17:58] and I thought, "Praise the Lord." That's
[1:18:00] where I wanted it. I wanted it on the
[1:18:01] fence. The problem with morning glory,
[1:18:04] it don't stay on the fence.
[1:18:06] Amen. You know, that's the way some of
[1:18:08] you thought. You thought you just get
[1:18:09] enough Christianity to come down at
[1:18:10] church on Sunday morning. Amen. But one
[1:18:13] day the word was going forth and
[1:18:14] something on the inside of you said,
[1:18:15] "No, you're called to be higher than
[1:18:17] that." You're not some leoty and chicken
[1:18:20] just a peck and scratch around. Amen.
[1:18:22] You there's there's heights that you
[1:18:24] were made to fly in. Amen. Well, if you
[1:18:26] want to be that eagle, Amen. You got to
[1:18:28] recognize what kind of life is in you.
[1:18:30] Amen. Cuz that morning glory starts
[1:18:32] pushing out. All of a sudden, it takes
[1:18:33] over my yard. It goes up my trees. It
[1:18:36] went up the side of my garage. Went up
[1:18:37] the side of my house. It got into my
[1:18:39] vegetable garden. And it started at the
[1:18:41] bottom of my tomato plants and it went
[1:18:43] all the way up to the top of every last
[1:18:45] one of them and choked them out. Weeds
[1:18:48] couldn't grow in my garden cuz they were
[1:18:50] too full of morning glory. Amen. I'm
[1:18:52] preaching to you this morning. That's
[1:18:54] what God planted in you. Amen. When he
[1:18:56] made you a partaker of the divine
[1:18:58] nature, he put the law of a seed within
[1:19:00] you that there's a life in there that's
[1:19:02] going to grow. Amen. And it's going to
[1:19:04] take over everything. Amen. Don't worry.
[1:19:06] Amen. You got sin in your life. Let the
[1:19:08] Holy Spirit choke it out. Amen. You got
[1:19:10] things that need pushed out. Let God
[1:19:12] push it out. You'll never separate it.
[1:19:15] Amen. But God puts something in you.
[1:19:17] Amen. With the ability in it. Amen. To
[1:19:20] take over. Hallelujah. Just like, you
[1:19:22] know, driving around these these back
[1:19:24] roads around here. Down here, you got a
[1:19:25] lot of that kudu, I think it's called,
[1:19:27] if I'm saying that right. You see that
[1:19:29] everywhere. And you know that kudzu, it
[1:19:31] just it starts to whenever it just it
[1:19:33] gets a chance to sprout. Next thing you
[1:19:35] know, it takes over everything. Nothing
[1:19:37] else can live there. It's just the only
[1:19:39] life that can do. You know why it's so
[1:19:41] aggressive and why you can't control it?
[1:19:43] Because it came from another country.
[1:19:45] Amen. Amen. That's why you'll never
[1:19:48] Amen. You'll never hold back the Holy
[1:19:49] Ghost. Amen. That That's why you'll
[1:19:51] never hold back a predestinated son or
[1:19:53] daughter of God. Amen. The devil can
[1:19:55] pile unbelief on you. He can try to push
[1:19:57] you down with condemnation. He can tempt
[1:19:59] you. He can attack you. Amen. But
[1:20:01] there's Amen. There's a life in you that
[1:20:03] came from another world. Amen. It has no
[1:20:06] natural predators.
[1:20:10] Say, "Brother Nathan, how Amen. I'm
[1:20:11] living in this flesh body and and and is
[1:20:14] subject to sin. Amen. And every time I
[1:20:16] try to do good, evil is present." Amen.
[1:20:18] Well, you know that's right. The Bible
[1:20:20] says there's a law of death that's in
[1:20:21] your flesh. Amen. And that law is trying
[1:20:24] to have a hold on you. Amen. And and
[1:20:26] make you subject to the urges and the
[1:20:29] temptations of the flesh. You know, but
[1:20:31] look, there's another law in you called
[1:20:32] the law of life. Amen. And and that and
[1:20:35] so then the law of life, Paul says, has
[1:20:38] set us free from the law of sin and
[1:20:40] death. Amen. You you ever think about,
[1:20:43] you know, how uh I believe one time
[1:20:45] brother talks about an eagle when he's
[1:20:46] flying, how he defies the law of
[1:20:48] gravity, right? Or when you raise your
[1:20:50] hand, you know, you're defying the law
[1:20:52] of gravity. Ever heard that? But you
[1:20:55] know something, the law of gravity is
[1:20:56] universal. And uh you know I don't mean
[1:20:59] to give you a physics lesson today, but
[1:21:01] you know that if you look at an eagle
[1:21:02] flying in the sky, the whole time he's
[1:21:05] flying, the law of gravity's acting on
[1:21:07] him the whole time. Amen. An eagle
[1:21:09] doesn't have a magic ability to put to
[1:21:11] put uh you know to put uh the law of
[1:21:13] gravity on pause. It's just that there
[1:21:15] are other laws. There's laws of
[1:21:17] aerodynamics.
[1:21:19] Amen. And the laws of And so the reason
[1:21:21] an eagle can fly, Amen, is because he
[1:21:23] overcomes the law of gravity with the
[1:21:25] laws of aerodynamics. Amen. That's how
[1:21:28] we overcome, brother, sister. It ain't
[1:21:29] about being perfect in your flesh. But
[1:21:31] to recognize there's a law in the seed
[1:21:34] that's in you. There's a law of life
[1:21:35] there. And the law of life God put in
[1:21:37] you. Amen. It's got the power in it to
[1:21:39] overcome the flesh. Amen. There's it's a
[1:21:42] greater law. Amen. You can soar. Amen.
[1:21:45] Higher than you think you can. You just
[1:21:48] got to trust in the right law.
[1:21:50] Hallelujah.
[1:21:52] Amen. It's the morning glory. It's the
[1:21:55] rising of the sun. It's a shalom
[1:21:57] message. I I believe you know I I I'm
[1:22:00] convinced you could drop a nuclear bomb
[1:22:02] on that old house. You could erase every
[1:22:04] memory of Nathan Ericson. Ever se every
[1:22:06] cell of me. Amen. That that ever
[1:22:08] inhabited there. But next spring that
[1:22:11] morning glory is coming back. Just as
[1:22:13] sure. Don't you ever p Don't you ever
[1:22:15] plant that in your yard, friends. And
[1:22:17] God has put something in you. Amen. It's
[1:22:19] a resurrection life. It's a it's a it's
[1:22:22] a token life. There's a there's a law in
[1:22:24] it. There's a power in it. Amen. God's
[1:22:26] not God's not worried about whether
[1:22:28] it'll be there on resurrection morning.
[1:22:30] Amen. He's not worried about whether
[1:22:31] you're going to take a rapture. He
[1:22:32] already planted rapture in you. Can't
[1:22:35] you see it, friends? Amen. It's the law
[1:22:37] of life that's in a Christian.
[1:22:39] Hallelujah. And then if you're a seed,
[1:22:41] there's only one limitation on how far a
[1:22:44] seed can grow, and that's the season
[1:22:46] that it's living in. But friends, we're
[1:22:49] not in a justification season. We're not
[1:22:52] in a sanctification season. We're not in
[1:22:54] a Pentecostal Zusa street. We're not
[1:22:56] Pentecostal babies, but we've received a
[1:22:58] message. And brother Brandham said, now
[1:23:00] we're living in the blossom. Amen. And
[1:23:02] the message has come to a place. Amen.
[1:23:05] Where it's time for manifested sons to
[1:23:07] come forth. What are you saying, brother
[1:23:09] Nathan? I'm saying whatever your idea is
[1:23:12] of the ceiling of your potential. You
[1:23:14] got something in your mind. It's a it's
[1:23:16] a ceiling. And you say, "Well, Brother
[1:23:18] Nathan, if I'm going to be a Christian,
[1:23:19] I'll only ever be this much of a
[1:23:21] Christian. And this is just as high as I
[1:23:23] think I can go. What I want you to do
[1:23:25] this morning, take that, throw it away.
[1:23:27] Amen. Throw it away. Cuz I'm talking
[1:23:29] about we're living in a season and
[1:23:31] there's a seed that's in you that's got
[1:23:33] potential in it like you can't even
[1:23:35] imagine. Amen. If you only knew what
[1:23:37] kind of a Christian you could be. If you
[1:23:39] only knew what kind of a what kind of a
[1:23:41] father, what kind of a mother, what kind
[1:23:43] of a preacher, what kind of an elder.
[1:23:45] Amen. What kind of a young person you
[1:23:47] could be. Get rid of your artificial
[1:23:49] constraints. Get rid of your idea and
[1:23:52] realize, Amen. This is the age of the
[1:23:54] blossom. This is the age for a bride
[1:23:57] manifestation.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You got to get rid of it. Amen.
[1:24:00] Because look, Amen. No matter where a
[1:24:02] Christian's at, Amen. There's a law in
[1:24:04] them. There's a voice in them, a seed.
[1:24:07] Amen. That wants to push up higher.
[1:24:09] Amen. Don't you you can't stop halfway
[1:24:11] on the journey. You're called to your
[1:24:14] adoption. Predestinated to adoption.
[1:24:17] Hallelujah. That means if you're
[1:24:19] predestinated to adoption, there is a
[1:24:22] positional placing. There is an
[1:24:24] expression. There is a beauty, a
[1:24:26] blossom, a fragrance that's going to
[1:24:28] come out of your life. And no other
[1:24:30] flower, no other person can reproduce
[1:24:32] it. Amen. There's nobody else. Amen. It
[1:24:35] don't mean everybody's got to be another
[1:24:36] William Brandham. It don't mean
[1:24:38] everybody else has got to be everybody's
[1:24:39] got to be a preacher. Paul said not all
[1:24:41] speak with tongues. Not all perform
[1:24:43] miracles. That's not what we're talking
[1:24:44] about. It's not some charismatic idea
[1:24:47] of, you know, throw away your limits and
[1:24:48] everybody's going to be rich and
[1:24:50] successful and famous and have a great
[1:24:52] ministry. No, sir. Amen. It's much
[1:24:55] greater than that. Amen. It's saying
[1:24:57] throw what? It's saying there's a seed
[1:24:58] on the inside of you. Amen. And that
[1:25:00] seed has a destiny. That seed has a
[1:25:03] future. There is something God wants to
[1:25:05] bring out of your life that nobody else
[1:25:07] can reproduce. You got a place in his
[1:25:09] bouquet. He made you a different a
[1:25:11] different color, a different shape, a
[1:25:13] different stature with different
[1:25:14] fragrance with a different appearance.
[1:25:17] Amen. Because Amen. He wants to bring
[1:25:19] his glory out of you. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:25:22] And I that's what I want in my life.
[1:25:24] Amen. I received a message which took
[1:25:26] the limits off of me. I want to be
[1:25:28] everything I can be. I want to preach
[1:25:31] Amen. Uh to the best that I can preach.
[1:25:33] I want to live to the greatest I can
[1:25:35] live cuz that's the age that we're
[1:25:37] living in.
[1:25:39] Hallelujah. Amen. You're an overcoming
[1:25:42] Christian. You're the bride of Jesus
[1:25:43] Christ. You're not under you're not
[1:25:45] under condemnation. You're not under the
[1:25:47] leodys and rebuke. You're not naked,
[1:25:50] blind, and miserable. No, you're a
[1:25:52] you're a flower in full bloom.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand would talk about that pond
[1:25:57] lily. I always thought it was amazing
[1:25:58] you use the pond lily specifically. How
[1:26:01] that it came out of the muck and how
[1:26:03] it's come up through, you know, came out
[1:26:04] of a dark place. You remember where you
[1:26:06] were when this message found you. Amen.
[1:26:08] You were down in a dark place somewhere
[1:26:10] crawling around in filthy things. Amen.
[1:26:12] But the grace of God called you up and
[1:26:15] it brought you up above the mud. It
[1:26:16] brought you out, Amen, into the sunshine
[1:26:19] and it's brought your life into blossom.
[1:26:20] And we look around at Christians, amen,
[1:26:22] showing the virtues of Christ and
[1:26:24] showing his character and Amen. and
[1:26:26] manifesting his life in this day. And
[1:26:28] you look at that and you say, "What a
[1:26:29] beautiful lily." Amen. But you can't
[1:26:31] point at that. Amen. Sometimes people,
[1:26:33] you know, they some the Lord brings them
[1:26:35] so far and they're still under
[1:26:37] condemnation of where they came from.
[1:26:39] But brother Bam said, "Look, you can't
[1:26:40] you can't say nothing about that lily."
[1:26:43] Amen. Once he comes up to a blossom, you
[1:26:45] say, "Well, he come out of the mud.
[1:26:47] Well, you know that brother, you I know
[1:26:49] what kind of church he came out of and
[1:26:50] you know that sister, I remember her
[1:26:52] family situation and that that young
[1:26:54] man, you know, he was in he was messed
[1:26:56] up in such terrible things, you know,
[1:26:57] and brother Bam said, "You can't you
[1:26:59] can't say anything about him now." Amen.
[1:27:02] cuz he's not in the mud now. Now he's on
[1:27:04] top. Amen. You can't point back at what
[1:27:07] he was. What is he now? He's on top.
[1:27:10] Glory to God.
[1:27:12] Amen. But you know, it hits a little
[1:27:15] different for a young Christian or a
[1:27:18] young person, Amen, who's not on top of
[1:27:21] everything and they're they're in a
[1:27:23] season in their life, amen, where they
[1:27:24] don't feel like they're up in full
[1:27:26] bloom. They feel like they're they're
[1:27:27] just down there in the mud. Amen. And
[1:27:29] and you look at that lily, the journey
[1:27:31] that it had to come through. Amen. And
[1:27:33] you watch this now, how that it uh it
[1:27:35] started down in a filthy place. And when
[1:27:38] you pass over the seed down there in the
[1:27:39] earth, whatever kind of neighborhood you
[1:27:41] grew up in, a lot of you, Amen. when you
[1:27:43] when when when when somebody passed over
[1:27:46] you, they couldn't tell the difference
[1:27:47] between the seed and the rock next to it
[1:27:49] and the clump of dirt next to that. It
[1:27:51] just looked like it was like all the
[1:27:52] rest of the earth. No, not no difference
[1:27:54] to it.
[1:27:55] not not expressing anything different
[1:27:57] than just a regular worldly person. But
[1:28:00] somehow someway there was a potential in
[1:28:02] that seed that all the rest of the earth
[1:28:04] didn't have. And so one day, amen, a
[1:28:07] little ray of light came down and it
[1:28:09] somehow it got through all of that filth
[1:28:11] and dirt and all the molecules of earth.
[1:28:13] Amen. It came down and it struck the
[1:28:15] seed just right. Amen. When that little
[1:28:17] light struck you, Amen. Now, what it
[1:28:19] might not have, you might not have
[1:28:20] jumped and screamed to shout it. Or
[1:28:22] maybe you did, but it's not always a
[1:28:23] great big explosion. Sometimes just a
[1:28:25] little.
[1:28:27] But from that time, something awakens in
[1:28:30] that seed. Now, now, but when it comes
[1:28:32] to its awakening, it's in a filthy
[1:28:34] place. It's surrounded by filthy things.
[1:28:37] Amen. But look, Amen. There's a law in
[1:28:39] that seed. It don't matter how deep it's
[1:28:42] buried in filth. Amen. How how earthly
[1:28:44] it is, something in it says, "I want to
[1:28:47] rise." So it starts to push back on on
[1:28:50] the filth and it pushes back on the muck
[1:28:52] and it begins to claw and fight and oh
[1:28:55] the harder it fights the dirtier it
[1:28:57] gets. Amen. But something's driving it
[1:28:59] until it pushes and and strives and
[1:29:02] works and toils and spins and all of a
[1:29:04] sudden there's a breakthrough.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank God for the
[1:29:09] breakthrough. But you know what happens
[1:29:10] to a lot of Christians? They come to
[1:29:12] that breakthrough and guess where that
[1:29:14] lily is? It's still at the bottom of a
[1:29:15] pond. Yeah. And so all of a sudden
[1:29:18] people think they get the Holy Ghost and
[1:29:19] all their problems are over. But then
[1:29:21] they find out they get out in the water
[1:29:22] and they're under pressure. Amen. And
[1:29:24] then you know the Leotan tides come
[1:29:27] through and Amen. all these influences
[1:29:29] around you and you're trying to live a
[1:29:30] Christian life and trying to grow. Amen.
[1:29:32] But it's pushing you this way. And Amen.
[1:29:34] is pushing you that way. And Amen.
[1:29:36] Something just it's just hard to keep
[1:29:38] your bearing. It's hard to Amen. But
[1:29:39] something in that lily says no, I don't
[1:29:41] belong here either. There's got to be
[1:29:43] something higher than this. There's got
[1:29:45] to be something greater than this. And
[1:29:47] and so it begins to swim. It begins to
[1:29:49] go against the flow and it'll look
[1:29:51] around. It might look at the other the
[1:29:53] other plants down there under the water.
[1:29:54] And then what I don't know what the
[1:29:56] plant's called. We always call it
[1:29:58] seaweed, but it's a freshwater one
[1:30:00] actually. You know when you go these
[1:30:01] little streams around here and there's
[1:30:03] that one there's that one little weed
[1:30:05] and uh when the water's running real
[1:30:07] fast, it's just
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; and then a flood or something comes and
[1:30:12] the tides turn and it's run the other
[1:30:14] way and it just
[1:30:18] cuz it's made for shallow water. There's
[1:30:20] nothing in that kind of a plant to
[1:30:22] resist. Nothing in it to try to get any
[1:30:24] higher than that. It just goes with the
[1:30:26] flow. Amen. And you know, sometimes
[1:30:29] Christians, they think they look at
[1:30:30] people in the world and they say, "Why
[1:30:32] why can't I be like everybody else? Why
[1:30:34] can't I just do what's normal? Why can't
[1:30:36] I just go with the flow? You know, why
[1:30:37] can't I just, you know, why can't I just
[1:30:39] give way to the pressure and just But
[1:30:41] no, cuz there's a different life on the
[1:30:43] inside of you." Amen. that's wrestling
[1:30:45] with that and say, "No." Amen. I've got
[1:30:47] a backbone. I've got a structure.
[1:30:49] There's a strength to the life that's in
[1:30:51] me. I'm not going to bow over and be
[1:30:53] tossed by every tide. Amen. I'm going
[1:30:55] higher. I'm rising up.
[1:31:02] Amen. And oh my Amen. And when it gets
[1:31:06] to the top of that water and then it
[1:31:08] comes out into the presence of the sun
[1:31:10] and comes out in that warmth and gets
[1:31:13] above all of those pressures and things
[1:31:15] and then brother Brand said it just
[1:31:16] opens up its bud and Amen. And and uh
[1:31:19] and and comes into full blossom and a
[1:31:22] fragrance comes out of it and everybody
[1:31:24] around can enjoy the atmosphere of that
[1:31:27] lily. Why? Because it's an overcomer.
[1:31:29] Amen. Because it's pushed up through
[1:31:31] some things. Cuz it's living on top.
[1:31:35] But again, for a young person, for a
[1:31:37] young Christian who's not on top,
[1:31:40] sometimes, you know, you look at where
[1:31:42] somebody else is, you say, "I'll never
[1:31:44] get there. I'll never get there. Look at
[1:31:46] that life is in full blossom. I'm down
[1:31:48] here. I'm messing with this filthy
[1:31:50] thing, and I'm and brother Nathan, I
[1:31:51] feel like that I don't feel like a that
[1:31:53] overcoming lily today. I feel like that
[1:31:56] I feel like I'm like you're I'm under
[1:31:57] the water, and I'm I'm feeling all this
[1:31:59] pressure, and I I'm drowning. I think
[1:32:01] I'm drowning, Brother Nathan.
[1:32:04] Here's what you got to realize. Amen.
[1:32:06] You can look at that beautiful
[1:32:07] overcoming lily. That beautiful blossom
[1:32:10] of a Christian life. Amen. And and and
[1:32:13] what a beautiful life it is. Amen. But
[1:32:15] look, when that when it was buried down
[1:32:17] there in the dirt so deep you couldn't
[1:32:19] even tell the difference, it was still a
[1:32:21] lily. And when it was pushing up through
[1:32:23] that filth and crawling out of the muck,
[1:32:26] it was a lily then. And it was going
[1:32:28] when it was swimming against the tide
[1:32:29] and getting pushed here and there. Amen.
[1:32:31] and and and a and and and uh and subject
[1:32:33] to every influence. It was still a lily.
[1:32:36] Amen. It was a lily the whole time
[1:32:38] because the law, Amen, is not in the
[1:32:40] blossom. The law is in the seed. Amen.
[1:32:42] And when God, Amen, when you were born
[1:32:44] again, God sealed his virtues in you in
[1:32:47] potential form. Amen. With the with when
[1:32:50] made you a partaker of the divine
[1:32:52] nature. Brother Ram said when you got
[1:32:54] the Holy Ghost, God gave you everything
[1:32:56] you have need of for life's journey.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't add virtue to your
[1:33:01] faith. Let the Holy Spirit do it. You
[1:33:03] can't add knowledge to your virtue. Let
[1:33:05] the Holy Spirit do it. Let the inside
[1:33:07] teacher. Amen. Just push up and let him
[1:33:10] have let patience have her perfect work.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just trust the Lord. Trust the
[1:33:16] seed that he planted in you. It was a
[1:33:18] lily the whole time, friends. Amen.
[1:33:21] Amen. Still a lily. And that's what you
[1:33:23] are. On your worst day, you're a child
[1:33:25] of God. Amen. In your worst struggle,
[1:33:28] you're still a child of God. You can't
[1:33:30] change the nature of the seed.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; You can only yield to the law that's in
[1:33:35] it.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam preached the law of life in
[1:33:39] the restoration of the bride tree.
[1:33:40] Remember my I don't have time to preach
[1:33:42] everything that's on my heart today. I'm
[1:33:44] enjoying myself though. Amen. He he he
[1:33:47] talked about that law. It's in a fish.
[1:33:49] And just to just to put it in a quick
[1:33:51] paraphrase, you know, he's talking about
[1:33:52] a fish might try really hard to be a
[1:33:54] fish. It goes up and gets a big burst
[1:33:56] gulp of air and says I'm going to dive
[1:33:58] down real deep. Brother Bram said it'll
[1:33:59] burst because it's not made to try to be
[1:34:02] a fish. It's already made to live in
[1:34:04] those conditions. If he said if a bird
[1:34:06] gets running said, well, if I run real
[1:34:08] hard and flap my wings real hard, I'm
[1:34:09] just going to try to fly. Brother said
[1:34:11] he won't get off the ground. Amen.
[1:34:13] Because look, amen. There's already
[1:34:15] something put into that nature. There's
[1:34:17] a law in the life of a bird. He's
[1:34:18] already made to fly. He's just got to
[1:34:20] yield to the currents of air. Amen. He's
[1:34:23] got to use what's already in him by a
[1:34:24] law of life. And brother Bam said, "We
[1:34:26] have a law of life." Amen. Cuz a lot of
[1:34:28] people, Amen, they say, "I'm going to
[1:34:30] try real hard to be a Christian. I'm
[1:34:32] going to work real hard. Oh Lord, when I
[1:34:34] get up from this altar, you know, I'm
[1:34:35] going to do better. I'm going to go turn
[1:34:37] over a new leaf. This time it'll be
[1:34:38] different." But brother Brand said,
[1:34:41] "Amen. It's uh" He said uh he said,
[1:34:43] "It's not how we fight and pull and
[1:34:45] hurry and say, "If I don't get this and
[1:34:47] I don't get that." He said, "That's not
[1:34:49] it. It's to know that the law of life is
[1:34:52] in you. And then you just let go and let
[1:34:55] God. And he takes you to your healing.
[1:34:58] He takes you to the baptism of the
[1:34:59] spirit. Any claim he's given is yours by
[1:35:02] letting go and letting God. Amen. It's
[1:35:04] come to find out I'm a son of God. I'm a
[1:35:07] daughter of God. Amen. And so there's a
[1:35:09] life already in me. I've just got to
[1:35:11] yield to it.
[1:35:13] I'm not trying to be the bride. I'm not
[1:35:16] trying to be a Christian. Stop trying to
[1:35:19] be a son of God. You already are. Just
[1:35:22] yield to what you are. When the Holy
[1:35:25] Ghost says, "Hey, that ain't what we're
[1:35:26] about." Uh, we don't look at that. We
[1:35:29] don't say that. We don't we don't go
[1:35:31] here. Amen. That's not who we are. Then
[1:35:33] you just yield to the law of life. Amen.
[1:35:35] See, there's something already on the
[1:35:37] inside testifying of who you are. Oh,
[1:35:40] what a beautiful thing. I think about
[1:35:41] that Reverend Mr. Lily, Brother Bram,
[1:35:42] would talk about. remember how he'd go
[1:35:44] on and on and it's amazing picture that
[1:35:47] he paints about how this lily how that
[1:35:49] it's got to how it's got to push out.
[1:35:52] Oh, he said it's got to toil and work
[1:35:53] and it's got to oh, just spin and and
[1:35:56] just crawl its way up out of the dirt to
[1:35:58] get up and be the lily that it's
[1:35:59] supposed to be.
[1:36:02] Amen. And then I went, you know, and and
[1:36:04] and then I went and heard what Jesus
[1:36:06] said. He said, "Consider the lily. They
[1:36:09] toil not, neither do they spin." And I
[1:36:12] thought, well, there's a paradox. But
[1:36:14] you know what? I believe it is, friends.
[1:36:16] Amen. Sure, Lily. You know, sure, Lily's
[1:36:18] got to rise above some things. There's
[1:36:20] things it's got to press through to be
[1:36:22] what it is and to express the the
[1:36:24] potentials that are in it. But it
[1:36:27] doesn't have to work to be a lily.
[1:36:30] And brother, sister, you never worked
[1:36:32] one day in your life to be a child of
[1:36:34] God. Amen. It was grace that elected
[1:36:36] you. Grace that predestinated you. Amen.
[1:36:39] Grace that's got a hold of you. It was
[1:36:41] his grace that made you a child of God.
[1:36:43] Sooner you find out who you are, sooner
[1:36:45] you can rest and let the law of life
[1:36:47] that's in you go to work. Yield, amen,
[1:36:50] to the life that's in you. Oh. Oh
[1:36:52] friends, he said that little that little
[1:36:54] seed burst open into life. Brother Bram
[1:36:57] said it can't do that till it goes
[1:36:58] through all that process. It's in the
[1:37:00] message birth pains. A birth pains of
[1:37:03] going through a process. Amen. But when
[1:37:06] it gets fully above the dirty water and
[1:37:08] muck and so forth, oh, he said it's so
[1:37:10] happy and it gives its life out freely.
[1:37:12] And it's a beautiful life. A beautiful
[1:37:15] life when it gets into the presence of
[1:37:16] that which is drawing it. Amen. Friends,
[1:37:19] a lot of people come to the church,
[1:37:21] Amen. And they got just enough religion
[1:37:23] to make them miserable. But let me tell
[1:37:25] you, Amen. If if uh if all you got is a
[1:37:28] bunch of dos and don'ts and rules and
[1:37:29] regulations and church membership and
[1:37:32] current events and whatever the latest
[1:37:34] drama is and Amen. and you're miserable
[1:37:36] under that. Amen. Don't you know there's
[1:37:38] something higher up? It's the presence
[1:37:41] of the Lord Jesus revealed in this
[1:37:43] message. It's drawing us up. Amen. And
[1:37:46] if you could ever get up into that, it's
[1:37:48] a beautiful life. What's the message to
[1:37:50] you, brother Nathan? It ain't a cult.
[1:37:52] Amen. It ain't it ain't a it ain't
[1:37:55] legalism. Amen. It ain't it ain't some
[1:37:57] ism. Amen. It's the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:38:00] revealed to me personally. And it's a
[1:38:02] beautiful life in the presence of the
[1:38:04] Lord. It's a beautiful life to see
[1:38:06] Christ. Amen. Revealed in his word. It's
[1:38:09] a beautiful life. How many want to reach
[1:38:12] that beautiful life? Oh, no doubt. We're
[1:38:14] all pressing through some things. We all
[1:38:16] got a things we need to get on top of.
[1:38:18] Amen. But there's a law of life within
[1:38:20] us. Amen. that with the power in it to
[1:38:22] get there.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Thank God for that sunlight
[1:38:27] pulling us up.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Pulling us up. Oh, I'm reaching for that
[1:38:32] beautiful life. My my when can where can
[1:38:36] we sit this down?
[1:38:38] Amen. You see
[1:38:40] the thing about a a flower. Amen. What a
[1:38:43] flower is for. A flower has a purpose.
[1:38:46] There's a there's a sermon in a flower.
[1:38:48] There's a meaning. There's a beauty.
[1:38:50] There's a truth in it. A a and uh and it
[1:38:54] it's in the scripture. It has its place
[1:38:55] in the word of God.
[1:38:58] But the thing about a flower, most of
[1:38:59] what the scripture has to say about a
[1:39:00] flower, it's very fragile. It's very
[1:39:03] fragile. And it's a that speaks of your
[1:39:06] human life. Friends, I want you to think
[1:39:08] about, you know, here on earth, look, uh
[1:39:11] uh you know, what do we get? 70, 80
[1:39:12] years of life. And there's something in
[1:39:15] me, I believe it's a seed. There's a
[1:39:18] voice in me that says,"I not here to
[1:39:21] live 70, 80 years and have a job and
[1:39:24] build a house and have get married and
[1:39:26] have some kids, you know, and accumulate
[1:39:28] some wealth and then die and it all just
[1:39:30] fades back into the void and none of it
[1:39:32] meant anything."
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; The seed speaks of purpose. Every time
[1:39:37] Brother Brand would preach on a seed,
[1:39:39] he's preaching about purpose. A seed has
[1:39:41] purpose. That's what drives it. That's
[1:39:43] what brings it higher. God didn't give
[1:39:45] me the Holy Ghost just to sit on my
[1:39:47] hands and join a church. There's
[1:39:49] something for me to do with the power of
[1:39:51] the Holy Ghost. There's something for me
[1:39:52] to express. I'm here for a reason,
[1:39:54] friends. Amen. Oh, don't you know what a
[1:39:57] privilege it is to be in God's bouquet
[1:39:58] today? There's only going to be so many
[1:40:01] message believers. There's only going to
[1:40:02] be so many message churches. There's
[1:40:04] only going to be so many Sundays to
[1:40:06] worship the Lord in the light of this
[1:40:08] hour. Only so many sermons to preach and
[1:40:10] only so many preachers to preach them.
[1:40:13] There's only going to be so much time.
[1:40:15] Amen. And if we spend all that time and
[1:40:18] it didn't mean anything, then what was
[1:40:20] the point of it all? But what the flower
[1:40:22] tells us is that yes, I'm fragile. Yes.
[1:40:26] Amen. A man is a flower and he quickly
[1:40:28] fadeth. Amen. But while I'm here, I've
[1:40:31] got something to express. There was a
[1:40:33] little flower one day. Amen. It only
[1:40:36] bloom maybe only bloomed for a week and
[1:40:37] then it wilted away. But that particular
[1:40:40] flower was in the right time and in the
[1:40:42] right place that gave it purpose. Amen.
[1:40:45] Because it was growing next to where Job
[1:40:47] was walking one day and Job looked down
[1:40:49] at that flower and all of a sudden a
[1:40:51] revelation struck him and under the gaze
[1:40:54] of the prophet that flower's life took
[1:40:56] on a greater meaning cuz he said the
[1:40:59] flower goes away but the next spring it
[1:41:01] comes back. Amen. Oh my. So therefore I
[1:41:04] can see the resurrection and the life of
[1:41:07] Jesus Christ. That's why I'm here,
[1:41:09] friends. I'm not here for long. I'm not
[1:41:11] here. Amen. I'm I'm here temporarily,
[1:41:15] but I'm here to bear witness to not only
[1:41:17] the resurrection, but the life of Jesus
[1:41:20] Christ. Amen. Because the same power
[1:41:22] that raised him from the dead has
[1:41:24] quickened this mortal body. Don't you
[1:41:26] see why you're here, friends? Amen. Your
[1:41:28] life doesn't have any meaning. It don't
[1:41:30] have any purpose. Amen. just to just to
[1:41:32] live a human life and fade away, but
[1:41:34] under the gaze of a message, under the
[1:41:36] under a prophetic gaze. Amen. Our time
[1:41:39] here matters. And I believe there's
[1:41:41] something that I can express. There's a
[1:41:44] fragrance we can bring forth in time
[1:41:46] which will echo in eternity.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Don't you want to do something for the
[1:41:51] Lord today? There's no such thing as a
[1:41:53] seed without a purpose.
[1:41:56] There's no such thing as a child of God
[1:41:58] without a destiny. There's no such a
[1:42:00] thing. There is a there is a there is a
[1:42:03] mountain that belongs to you. There is a
[1:42:05] positional placing. There is a work for
[1:42:07] you to do. There is something you're
[1:42:09] here on earth to express.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. The the only way we'll do it is by
[1:42:15] the law of life that's in us. Amen. I I
[1:42:18] want my life to serve a purpose. I want
[1:42:21] to show that beauty. Amen. Not just not
[1:42:24] beautiful Christ, not beautiful works,
[1:42:26] beautiful church membership, beautiful
[1:42:29] Christianity, beautiful life.
[1:42:32] Amen. You see, it's a it's there's a
[1:42:34] natural beauty to that when it's not all
[1:42:37] just put on and just all dressed up and
[1:42:39] when we're just not just trying to, you
[1:42:40] know, just trying to really really be a
[1:42:42] somebody of a Christian, but when
[1:42:44] there's a life that's in you that's
[1:42:46] pushing out that's that a fragrance
[1:42:48] that's coming forth freely. That's what
[1:42:51] I want. That's why brother Bram said
[1:42:52] that that little lily is greater than
[1:42:54] Solomon in all of his kingly garments
[1:42:56] because it didn't matter how much how
[1:42:58] well you dress Solomon up. It's
[1:42:59] artificial. But brother Bram said that
[1:43:02] Amen. That lilyy's got a natural beauty.
[1:43:05] That's why I like a natural
[1:43:06] Christianity. I don't like taking the
[1:43:08] message and trying to put dove feathers
[1:43:10] in a blackbird and, you know, trying to
[1:43:11] shove it down somebody's throat and just
[1:43:13] try to force it on our young people and
[1:43:15] try to manufacture and make sure
[1:43:16] everything everything looks so polished
[1:43:18] on the outside. I believe Amen. And when
[1:43:20] God sent a message, he knew that it was
[1:43:22] a message to human beings. And he so he
[1:43:25] understands human weakness. He
[1:43:26] understands human problems. He
[1:43:28] understands our human struggles. Amen.
[1:43:31] But he wasn't worried about that. He
[1:43:32] just went ahead and planted this
[1:43:34] message. And when he planted it, he put
[1:43:36] a law in it. Amen. That anybody who will
[1:43:38] any seed of God who will lay in the
[1:43:40] light of this word, Amen. and and uh and
[1:43:44] and dwell in the atmosphere of his
[1:43:46] presence,
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. will put forth an overcoming life.
[1:43:49] Amen.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; I don't believe in churches without
[1:43:52] purpose. I believe there's a reason. I
[1:43:55] believe there's a reason for Word of
[1:43:56] Life Church is here in Amen. in Johnson
[1:43:59] City, Tennessee. There's a reason we
[1:44:01] come to church today. There's a reason
[1:44:02] you're sitting where you're sitting.
[1:44:04] Brother Brand said that one time. He
[1:44:05] said he wanted you he wanted me in the
[1:44:06] pulpit, Brother Bam said, and he wanted
[1:44:08] you sitting exactly where you're
[1:44:09] sitting.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of purpose. Amen. And I
[1:44:13] all I want friends is in my little
[1:44:16] fragile liy human life I just want to
[1:44:20] serve his purpose
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; because brother Bram says any seed that
[1:44:23] serves God's purpose you can't keep it
[1:44:25] in the ground when resurrection comes.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; You never keep it in the ground.
[1:44:33] You know
[1:44:35] uh just bring it bring it down in a few
[1:44:37] moments here. When you walk into a
[1:44:39] house, you see what this bride is. See,
[1:44:42] it ain't just the prophet that was a
[1:44:44] flower. It ain't just the flowering life
[1:44:46] of the preacher, the pastor. But you're
[1:44:49] a flower in God's bouquet. Some of you
[1:44:51] say, "Well, y well, brother Nathan, but
[1:44:53] I don't feel like I've fully I I just
[1:44:56] haven't fully reached the potential of
[1:44:58] everything that I could be. I'm just
[1:45:00] maybe a bud. I'm not fully opened up."
[1:45:02] Brother Brandham said there's a purpose
[1:45:03] for a bud in his bouquet, too. There's a
[1:45:04] good quote for that. Amen. But but you
[1:45:07] see we've been gathered here together
[1:45:10] not to be members of word of life. Amen.
[1:45:13] But to be part of his bouquet. Amen. Cuz
[1:45:16] when he puts this see gathered with you
[1:45:18] sometimes you say how come I didn't get
[1:45:19] to grow up in church like these young
[1:45:20] people. How come I had to go through all
[1:45:22] that mess in the world and be mistreated
[1:45:23] and all that kind of stuff. Well look
[1:45:25] friends a real seed brother said you can
[1:45:27] put it under a slab of concrete. It'll
[1:45:29] find a way out. Some of you came through
[1:45:31] every kind of all kind of you grew
[1:45:32] through all kind of barbed wire and mess
[1:45:34] and fil and came out of a such a but you
[1:45:37] came forward and God had a purpose in
[1:45:39] bringing you through that cuz it brought
[1:45:41] a different expression out of your life
[1:45:42] and he's got another one that he raised
[1:45:44] in church and maybe they never spent
[1:45:45] much time in the world and he'll put you
[1:45:47] next to that one and then he'll get
[1:45:49] another one over here. What's he doing?
[1:45:50] He's making a bouquet. Amen. Because it
[1:45:52] takes more than one life. It takes more
[1:45:54] than one uh more than one person. Amen.
[1:45:56] To manifest the glory of God. Amen. But
[1:45:59] that's why we're here, friends, is just
[1:46:00] to play our part. Say, "God, position me
[1:46:03] in the bouquet." Amen. Let me do what
[1:46:04] I'm supposed to do in the church. Let me
[1:46:06] express what I'm supposed to express.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who you are is not where you came
[1:46:11] from. Amen. But it's the it's the life
[1:46:14] that you rose out of. Amen. It's a Amen.
[1:46:17] It's the who you are. Amen. Is what is
[1:46:20] where God envisions you in his bouquet.
[1:46:22] And then he gets it all together. And
[1:46:24] what does it mean, friends? What does it
[1:46:25] mean to believe the message and have
[1:46:27] message churches and and gather together
[1:46:30] like we do? It's like if you came if you
[1:46:33] if you came to a house of a young
[1:46:36] married couple, you walk in that house
[1:46:39] and on the kitchen table there is a
[1:46:40] beautiful bouquet.
[1:46:42] Now, what does that tell you? That tells
[1:46:45] you, look, look, there's a love affair
[1:46:47] going on in this house. Now, you might
[1:46:49] not see the you might not see the the
[1:46:52] husband. He might be somewhere else
[1:46:54] working on a better place for them to
[1:46:56] live. But when you see that bouquet,
[1:46:59] Amen. It bears witness that there's a
[1:47:01] love affair happening. Amen. That
[1:47:03] there's a romance that's unfolding in
[1:47:04] this place. That's what it ought to be.
[1:47:06] When somebody walks through these doors,
[1:47:08] spends a little time around the bride of
[1:47:10] Christ. There should be such an
[1:47:11] atmosphere of love. People should be so
[1:47:13] in love with the Lord. There should be
[1:47:15] fragrance. There should be beauty. There
[1:47:17] should be an expression. Amen. Cuz
[1:47:19] that's what the bouquet is. It's an
[1:47:21] expression of the heart of God. If I
[1:47:24] take if I go buy my wife a bouquet, it's
[1:47:26] been a little while. I should do that.
[1:47:28] If I buy her a bouquet of flowers and I
[1:47:29] bring it to I surprise her, you know,
[1:47:31] come in the door. Here's here's some
[1:47:32] flowers, honey. You know what? She she
[1:47:35] never uh she never asked me, "Oh, what
[1:47:38] store did you buy those at?"
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Uh huh. Was there was the
[1:47:44] traffic bad getting home? And you know,
[1:47:46] uh who who who was working the counter?
[1:47:48] Who sold it to you? Were they on sale or
[1:47:50] what? You know, she don't think about
[1:47:53] any of that cuz her what what her mind
[1:47:55] is fixed on in those flowers. What she's
[1:47:58] seeing is the expression of my heart.
[1:48:01] And friends, this message ain't about
[1:48:03] what church we go to and who's got the
[1:48:05] best ministry and you know and and uh
[1:48:07] you who's saying this and who's doing
[1:48:08] that and what they're teaching over
[1:48:10] there. Amen. And what this one said and
[1:48:12] how that one's acting and how this one's
[1:48:14] a hypocrite and that one's causing
[1:48:15] trouble in the church. That ain't the
[1:48:17] focus. Amen. But God sent a message.
[1:48:20] Amen. To bring the bride and Christ
[1:48:22] together. Amen. It ought to be such a
[1:48:24] love affair that we'd be undistracted by
[1:48:26] everything else. Amen. Oh my. When you
[1:48:29] get discouraged about what's going on
[1:48:30] around this message, I want you to
[1:48:32] understand something that you look
[1:48:34] around, you say, "Brother Nathan, we got
[1:48:35] church troubles, ministry troubles,
[1:48:37] fellowship troubles." Amen. And all
[1:48:40] these kind of organizational problems
[1:48:41] around the message. But the message
[1:48:43] wasn't sent to an organization. It was
[1:48:46] sent to an individual. Amen. And when I
[1:48:48] received the message, amen, it was such
[1:48:50] a love letter to me. Amen. I can't worry
[1:48:53] about what everybody else is doing. I'm
[1:48:55] too caught up in the message of the
[1:48:57] heart of God. He loved me. He elected
[1:49:00] me. And he put me here to be manifested
[1:49:02] as a son. I'm his bride. I'm going in a
[1:49:05] rapture. I'm destined for a wedding
[1:49:07] supper. Amen. It's a love affair.
[1:49:11] Don't worry about the rest. Amen. Just
[1:49:13] make sure you as an individual receive
[1:49:15] this love message. Let that Holy Spirit
[1:49:18] whisper in your ear.
[1:49:21] Amen. You remember what they used to do
[1:49:23] little girls? I think I don't know how
[1:49:25] far this goes back. It might It's like a
[1:49:26] Victorian thing or something. Goes way
[1:49:29] way back. Some of you Some of you did it
[1:49:30] when you were little. Little girl take a
[1:49:33] flower. Remember? Just say, "He loves
[1:49:36] me. He loves me not.
[1:49:39] He loves me. He loves me not." Because
[1:49:42] then you got to get once you get the
[1:49:43] last petal picked off of there, you find
[1:49:44] out whether he really loves you, right?
[1:49:47] You know, there's a trick to that
[1:49:48] because the trick is what kind of flower
[1:49:50] you use. Cuz some of them got an odd
[1:49:52] number of petals and some of them got an
[1:49:53] even number of petals. So if you really
[1:49:55] you really you can rig it to find out he
[1:49:57] really loves you if you want to. Amen.
[1:49:59] Just make sure it's the right kind of
[1:50:00] flower and you start picking that off.
[1:50:02] Love me, love me, not love me. Oh, he
[1:50:03] loves me. Oh my. But friends, that that
[1:50:06] ain't the kind of Amen. But there's so
[1:50:08] many Christians, you know, who got that
[1:50:10] mentality about it. Oh yeah. Sunday
[1:50:12] morning, oh, he loves me. I'm in church.
[1:50:14] I'm happy. I'm worshiping the Lord.
[1:50:16] Monday, oh, I'm being tempted and tried
[1:50:18] and Amen. Oh, he loves me not. And oh,
[1:50:20] Wednesday, glory to God, we're back in
[1:50:22] church. He loves me. And Thursday, oh
[1:50:25] no, I I'm a little depressed today. He
[1:50:27] loves me not. Amen, friends. Amen. What
[1:50:30] you got to find out is what kind of a
[1:50:31] flower you are. Amen. When you realize
[1:50:33] you're a seed of God. Amen. He loves you
[1:50:35] today. He love you tomorrow. He loves
[1:50:37] you the day after that. Amen. Get rid of
[1:50:40] your love me, love me, not religion. And
[1:50:42] just say, "Lord, I'm a seed of God. I'm
[1:50:44] predestinated to adoption. I'm coming up
[1:50:46] into full blossom. And I thank you for
[1:50:49] the light of this message that can make
[1:50:50] me all that I can be." Glory to God.
[1:50:53] Let's stand and worship the Lord today.
[1:50:56] Oh, aren't you glad you're in his
[1:50:57] bouquet? Blessed be the name of the
[1:50:59] Lord.
[1:51:01] He loves me. Loves me. Loves me. Loves
[1:51:03] me.
[1:51:07] That's the way it is, you know. Amen.
[1:51:09] When it when I hear brother Donnie
[1:51:11] preach, Amen. I I I'm seeing something
[1:51:13] in the bouquet, it's telling me, "Oh
[1:51:16] yeah, he loves me." That's what all
[1:51:18] these gifts and ministries are put in
[1:51:19] the body. When brother Harry sings, oh,
[1:51:22] he loves me. Amen. When this one plays
[1:51:24] the Amen. When when the when the when
[1:51:26] the brothers play the instruments and
[1:51:28] you hear that beautiful music, oh, he
[1:51:30] loves me. And we look at these young
[1:51:31] people raising up in the fear that to
[1:51:33] carry this message on to the coming of
[1:51:34] the Lord. Oh, he loves me. Amen. He He
[1:51:37] the message is real. Amen. His
[1:51:39] intentions are true. He's going to put
[1:51:41] me in a rapture. He's going to make me
[1:51:43] what he wants me to be cuz he loves me
[1:51:46] and he put a law of life in me by a seed
[1:51:48] of predestination.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; I'll close on this quote. We just ask
[1:51:53] the brothers to sing and lead us in
[1:51:55] worship. Brother Bamman, I know my
[1:51:57] redeemer liveth. It talks about the
[1:51:59] resurrection life of Jesus. He said
[1:52:01] nothing can destroy it.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; It's been planted.
[1:52:06] It is the seed of God. It is a purpose
[1:52:09] of God to give us the blessed Holy
[1:52:11] Spirit. It's the purpose of God to show
[1:52:13] us signs and wonders and miracles. It's
[1:52:15] the purpose of God and nothing can
[1:52:18] destroy it. All powers of hell might
[1:52:20] wage against it, but it will prevail. We
[1:52:24] have God's eternal promise. There might
[1:52:27] be teachers. There might be isms rise,
[1:52:29] great programs and things that look like
[1:52:31] it would be destroyed, but it can never
[1:52:33] be destroyed. It is the purpose of God
[1:52:37] to see that it will prevail. Then I love
[1:52:40] what he said. Then look, see, if it's
[1:52:42] the purpose of God, he says, then it's
[1:52:44] not up to me.
[1:52:46] Thank God. And it's not up to you
[1:52:48] whether it will be destroyed or not.
[1:52:50] It's up to God. And we can rest assured
[1:52:53] on it that God will never let our
[1:52:55] heritage be destroyed for it's his
[1:52:58] purpose to give it to us.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; How many feel the presence of the sun
[1:53:04] today?
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, I want to come up a little
[1:53:08] higher. I want to yield a little more to
[1:53:11] that law of life on the inside of me."
[1:53:13] We just have a word of prayer. Lord
[1:53:15] Jesus.
[1:53:17] Lord,
[1:53:19] we've gathered together today to look,
[1:53:21] Lord,
[1:53:24] for the power that we need, Lord, to
[1:53:26] take another step with you.
[1:53:28] Many of us need healing. Many of us need
[1:53:31] deliverance. Many of us need leadership,
[1:53:34] guidance,
[1:53:35] comfort.
[1:53:37] Oh, we're such a needy people, Lord.
[1:53:40] But I thank you, Jesus, that the power
[1:53:43] that we're looking for is not a million
[1:53:45] miles away.
[1:53:48] But you said when you planted that seed,
[1:53:50] Lord, in the good ground of these
[1:53:51] hearts,
[1:53:53] Lord, that you put within it, Lord, the
[1:53:57] potential and the power to become
[1:53:59] exactly what you wanted it to be. Lord,
[1:54:03] we're not so much trying real hard,
[1:54:05] Lord, to be Christians today. We're just
[1:54:08] trying to learn how to yield to the law
[1:54:10] of life that's already in us. I pray,
[1:54:12] Lord Jesus, that your Holy Spirit would
[1:54:15] come and the same quickening power,
[1:54:17] Lord, Lord, that that many of these
[1:54:19] lives before me, Lord, you you baptized
[1:54:22] them with the Holy Ghost maybe many
[1:54:23] years ago. Let that same quickening
[1:54:25] power move, Lord, on that seed life
[1:54:28] within them, Lord, and bring them into a
[1:54:29] fuller blossom. And if there been
[1:54:31] anybody here, Lord, who doesn't know you
[1:54:33] in life and reality, Lord, but they're
[1:54:36] just caught up in miserable religion,
[1:54:37] Lord, laying in a filthy place
[1:54:39] somewhere, let the quickening power,
[1:54:42] Lord, bring that seed to life. And from
[1:54:46] that time, Lord, let it never be the
[1:54:48] same. I commit this service into your
[1:54:50] hands, Lord. I pray, Lord, that hearts
[1:54:53] have been ministered to, Lord Jesus, use
[1:54:56] it for your glory, Lord. And we commit
[1:54:58] ourselves, this congregation, this
[1:55:00] church. Bless Lord, the pastor, the
[1:55:02] people. Bless this church in a special
[1:55:05] way. Continue to use them, Lord, as a
[1:55:07] bouquet of the expression of your heart,
[1:55:09] Lord, in the days ahead. In the name of
[1:55:12] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[1:55:16] God bless you.
