it uh pretty much sung out after the meetings but y'all can help me sing this we sing it around here uh I show Brother Louie a quote to the day where brother Brown talked about God coming down and

don't know about you I'm still rejoicing over the services we had here this weekend what the Lord was so wonderful to us wasn't he this is my 40th year being a pastor 40th year I've hosted a lot of meetings and those Decades of time but I believe I say this without exaggeration that these are the greatest meetings that I've ever hosted in my life oh Lord the preacher Brothers they've done awesome didn't they the singing the specials the music and the deacons is cooperating the food and it was just wonderful I just thought it was I just hoping the Rapture could take place on Monday I didn't want to go back to this everyday stuff you know where you just have to go through all this humdrum of life but I was just so blessed Myself by hearing the word and fellowship with the brothers and I just saw brother Tim who did an outstanding job in the first service and bringing about the dedication and what it awesome and then brother Ron of course and then Brother David I've heard Esther preached since I was knee-high to our grasshopper but I ain't never heard Esther preached like it was preached on Sunday there's only one regret I had about that I wish I'd appreciate it first I was just so blessed of course Brother David was too he was cutting a shine buddy bless his heart he's his Pentecostal as he can be [Applause] and in case y'all are wondering what Pentecostal church he come out of he didn't then in this message his whole life that's what the message will really do for us to get it under the right preacher [Applause] Hallelujah praise the lord we were just so so blessed and I just want to thank everybody again for everything that you did everybody it would have been it would have been utter chaos to try to have such a meeting without the deacons helping and the brothers and the parking and the sisters and preparing the food and then having to leave before service is over and you know you may wonder why we didn't want to have a a meal a full meal on Sunday morning well I preached a bunch of these conventions and I hear what the pastor's wives and the hosting church has to go through getting up three o'clock in the morning trying to fix a meal for everybody having to leave halfway through Sunday morning can't even hear the service and I thought you know what that's a lot to ask for our sisters to have to give up I know we're here to serve and I think we did well I heard it from one after another after another how that people were so blessed to be here and our kindness and so on hey that's what Christians do isn't it but I thought this year no we ain't going to do it on Sunday morning we just let them be able to enjoy the service and be able to get in it's a real shame as I said I mean I'm I'm on the inner circle and hearing the preachers and all that talk about what the church church has to go through and it's really sad when you have a special meeting for the local church and they miss so much because they're serving now some of you may have wondered why why did we need another church I hope this weekend was a great big answer to you we have been robbed we have been robbed for years of being able to have a meeting like we had because we couldn't put nobody anywhere else other than our crowd that we had no parking no chairs no nothing else so any of you that were still griping about it I hope your gripes went out with the shouts thank you praise the Lord now we can have one meeting after the other okay we've got plenty of room to do it God bless you let's turn together tonight well you've had all them great preachers now and all them exciting guys and now you're back with me again so First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 11. I love the word don't you I absolutely love it I'm so glad that our shouting and our rejoicing and are jumping and hollering is not based just on enthusiasm and emotion we get enthused God did we didn't know that Masterpiece 1964. God looked at his Masterpiece and God got enthused what he said God got enthused so there's nothing wrong with enthusiasm I won't say it's Enthusiast about the right thing but I'm glad that our enthusiasm and our excitement is based upon the word not just emotion I love to shout with that organ but I can shout just as good without it yeah I love shouting with that piano but I can shout just as good I've got my rhythm built in I've told you all before I'm a black man on the inside [Applause] the music makes it good but I've got to dance without the music wow because I go to wordburst that gives you a dance First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 11. let's consult again tonight the master builder for other Foundation can no man lathe and that is laid which is Jesus Christ now if any man build upon this Foundation brother Tim read this of course on the first service gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble Every Man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is if any man's work abide which he has built thereupon you shall receive rewards if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire we're going to pray tonight him may not to be remembered we've got a youth camp going up I'm sure many of you know it up in Indiana brother Daryl was there last night tonight and tomorrow night I got a text from him today requesting prayer for him that the Lord would just help him and the Lord will meet there with all those young folks and and meet their needs Erica went to the doctor today and her platelets are at 9 000. normal is a hundred and fifty thousand to 450. thousand hers is nine thousand so brother Donald what does that mean nothing it changes nothing you hear me it changes nothing amen We Believe God's A Healer amen so she texts me today from the doctor's office and and told me my God made the first platelets he'll take care of this so that's what we're believing so if you'd remember her tonight how many has a need a request on your heart God bless you let's just pray together Heavenly Father we thank you so much for your great blessings on each of us as your children Lord we're still just rejoicing from the tremendous Services we had and we're so thankful still see some of the saints that have hung around for a few days to be with us tonight and we're honored to have them with us again Lord and we're just praying that you take your word and speak to us father we're a needy people and you know our desires are to serve you and to please you with all that we are help me to move out of the way tonight with you Lord to be able to speak the words of Life Lord these needs and requests that we've made known to you we just pray that you'll move for every one of them you see Lord Erica set tomorrow to have the infusion of these platelets we know what the doctors are thinking we know what they are saying but Lord we refuse their reports we believe the report of the Lord amen by your stripes she's already been healed Lord these other needs tonight we commit them to you speak to us tonight from your word it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask it and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated let's turn also if you would in First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 4. now we've been looking at each of us as the saints of God that we are going to stand before the Lord in the elevated place not the white Throne judgment but the place to where that we will give an account for the Deeds Done in our body God will only require of each of us what God has given to us whatever those gifts and abilities are you'll never be required of what your brother your sister your pastor or some great man is you will only be required of what God gives you now I know that whenever we go to trying to find what does God want me to do so what is my place what is my position and no doubt most of you would probably say with me tonight sometimes that's one of the hardest things you'll ever find in your life it's what God wants you to do and what God wants you to be but you see God does not hang something out before us and let you pick it out and see if that works out for you try it and see if that's it no God doesn't do that but God actually equips us with what he's called us to do now we want to look at the gifts of the Spirit and I know this this is always treacherous when you go this way a lot of folks get nervous but we shouldn't because it's it's God's word First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 4 now there are diversities of gifts and diversities is diverse kinds though there are different kinds of gifts and we can say Amen to that now we saw three great men of God preached Friday Saturday and Sunday all three of them great preachers all three of them approach the word total different way all three of them had a total different delivery a total different way that they'd read the same scriptures and get something totally different out of it why because God diversifies his gifts so every preacher does not preach identical well thank God we wouldn't need but one if they did that one preacher preaching everybody just stream him and all the rest of us preachers just sent out but God Diversified defies the gifts that are in the body God diversifies the ministry the prophet even says it that some men dramatize and some are more like Paul more of a scholarly type some are more of a Firebrand an evangelist comes in all burning up and preaches faith and this and that gets you all fired up get you stirred up get something going inside your gastronomics and my you feel so fired up that way you can come back to church and the pastor can who upon you and you can take it a little bit better than you did before so every man has his own ability by which God gives him now notice Paul uses the words I want you to notice these next three verses how they tie together now they are diversities of gifts but the same spirit so there's different kinds of gifts and there are differences of administration so there's different kinds of gifts and then there are different types of administrations or offices now there are different gifts and there are administrations that will be diverse in the way they come out so even pastors none of them are the same evangelists are none the same teachers are all a little bit different an apostle a missionary so God diversifies each one of them in a way that pleases him now notice verse six and there are diversities of operations so there are diversities of gifts and there are differences of administrations how it will be administered so the office of the pastor for some they may not jump run holler but then there'll be other pastors like Brother David Siler he's a pastor and my goodness he was all across this Pulpit I thought that man was going to shout himself to death at the end of that service didn't you at that chalk statement I thought Lord have mercy I was looking at it last night and that man was back there shouting and running around well you know what but every Pastor don't do that so does that mean brother David's more spiritual a lot of it has to do with how many birthdays you've had as well so he's still a young man so there are differences of the administration's but the same Lord there are diversities of operation but it is the same God which work us all in all now notice how Paul is diversifying before he starts mentioning what the gifts are by name now we believe that God's word is true and infallible is that right and he believes Paul had the authority to write about this even though no other rider in the New Testament mentions them no writer in the Old Testament mentions the nine gifts amen so you mean you believe this on one man's word me too now what's but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all now this is why God does it God never gives us gifts so that we will be lifted up and people will adore us and make an idol out of us no it's so that God can get Glory out of every gift that he puts in the body now notice here we go to the gifts now he's going to name them photo one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom now when I was a Pentecostal preacher and spent those years that I did preaching and then a boy preacher and then on up till I was in there for several years what I found in Pentecost was the most sought after gifts was the vocal gifts which were tongues interpretation and prophecy I never run into anybody that wanted the gift of the word of wisdom I want to find amazing and the message is you find so few of people that want a Word of Wisdom in the message or even a word of knowledge well I thought we wanted all nine do we just want three or two or just certain ones isn't isn't this one important too you believe it is of course we do four to one is given I want you to know who gives it now so it's not us going and saying now Lord I want this and I want that and then Carol says now Lord I want this one and then you go and say well I want that one and you say I want this one that's not the way it comes the spirit of God gives it to us now we know how brother random taught this that actually the spirit of God could move on someone and they could raise up and speak in tongues and the spirit of God move on another one and they could interpret and it may never fall on them again it may never hit them again you know he said that right but at the same time there are some people that get the deposit of these gifts and they will have them their entire life now why does God do it that way you can ask him when you see him because I'm not really sure four to one is given by the spirit the word notice it's not plural the word and this word here is logos so it is the thought the concept the Mandate of God so to one is given the logos of wisdom now look at the meaning of the word wisdom Sophia Supreme intelligence such as belongs to God the wisdom of God as events informing and executing councils in the formation and government of the world and the scriptures so here is the first spiritual gift a word of wisdom so this is not wisdom that comes by age this is not wisdom that the Bible declared would come when a man would have strengths and his strength would be his glory when he was a young man and his gray hair would be his strength and his wisdom when he was an old man but this is a word that comes from God and it is not because well this ancient man has had so much experience in this aged woman has had so much experience and because of that experience then they're going to say this word to someone about this or that no no you see this word could actually come to a 20 year old man hang on everybody or the 20 year old woman oh goodness gracious alive now notice the Bible does not designate that these gifts are for men only oh dear Jesus help help me Lord come on now notice Paul does not say now these scriptures are only for the brothers notice how he identifies this for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom the word of wisdom so what is it it is a word that Taps into the Supreme wisdom of God I dare say if there's anybody here tonight that's been serving the lord for very long very many years filled with the Holy Ghost and that you can recall and if you will think about it more than likely there's more people here tonight than not who have had this to happen to you and you didn't even realize what it was it was a word it might have been two or three or four and you were talking to someone or someone was in need of something from God some counsel and all of a sudden something just dropped in your heart it was beyond you it was beyond your knowing it was beyond your understanding and it might not have been but a few words but it was divine and it was something that come from the Lord and the Lord dropped a word of wisdom and used you as an individual to encourage to uplift to be able to bring media you know a great encouragement to someone that's down and it come and you spoke it and you saw where did that come from I didn't even know I knew that you never knew it it wasn't like that the resource come from within you it was a word of wisdom so where does that come from it comes from the Eternal but now how many folks in the message want this gift well now you see this gift may not be used in the Pulpit all the time it is it is the word of wisdom is used behind the pulpit it's used in the office counseling people it's used in more private type secular settings I'm speaking about myself when God will drop something down in you and you sit there and you Marvel yourself Lord have mercy oh my goodness and you realize that was not you and I'll study friends I study every day of my life I study hours on end I study but that don't give me wisdom that only makes me ready when I stand up here the Holy Ghost has got more to anoint oh yeah and he can bring it back to your memory but whenever This falls upon you it's not something that you even learned not something that you know God drops this on you and it becomes a word of wisdom praise the Lord to another the word logos of knowledge now this Greek word is Nurses now it means knowing but I want you to look at it now it's not man again by man memorizing scripture man memorizing quotes but notice what the word gnosis means the deeper more perfect and enlarged knowledge of religion such as belongs to the more advanced so you mean then God would use some for a Word of Wisdom others it would be a gift now this is one of the nine spiritual gifts how many knew this nine spiritual gifts so God then so they're not speaking in tongues they may not even be shouting or jerking or anything like that but all of a sudden it's just a word of divine Supreme knowledge and remember there is no greater Source than him now no matter how much we know his word we don't know nothing compared to him so we limit what God can do through us when we say well I can't remember that and I don't remember I don't remember well the gift is there to to say something that you never even learned yourself in the first place but yet it comes from the Divine source of knowledge which is God God himself my Lord how many wants to be opened to let God use you now watch they don't ever say nothing contrary to the word so to one is by giving the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit now remember only one River but yet many gifts coming out of that River and that river is the Holy Ghost now once Paulie says to another face now we know that it's given to every man has a Measure of Faith but this is not the Saving Face here this is not the faith except well I believe God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son well you'll never be saved if you don't believe that but this gift right here is not that type of face this gift right here was in many men down to the ages it was really manifested uh back in the restoration but it was in a lot of men a man called Jack Cole a man called different ones that had the gift of faith now let me me if you're not familiar with Jacko you've heard the name of jacco right well this is what Jack Cole would do whenever people would come up in the prayer line to be prayed for every person that come up and had on glasses Jack Cole had an anvil an anvil standing beside his pulpit and the first thing he would do is reach and grab your glasses off of your face and take his hammer and bust your glasses so you better have faith or you're going to go off like this if you come up on crutches he would take your crutches and burst them to splinters not actually prayed for you before if you were in a wheelchair he would disable the wheelchair the prophet said he never seen a man like him was that what he called Bulldog face now you're imagining this that that man would have scared people to death brother REM said there's only one shot call God knew the world couldn't handle two of them at one time he said now he was a very radical type of a God but brother random identifying now remember Jacob never done any Discerning and Jack Cole was not a theologian he was a good preacher and of course some videos out on YouTube and stuff where he can hear him actually you're hearing preaching one place and brother Brandon was sitting there behind him and you'll watch brother Brown and she worships God and then he makes an order called brother round goes up and prays and stuff so that's at the same meeting but Jackal was not a theologian he was not a prophet but brother Brandon identifies Jacko of having the gift of faith now watch this most of the ministers who preach Divine Healing he says are usually all that I have ever met are great teachers of the word some of them says have a powerful face they lay hands on the people and scream out and make the enemy leaves them now that's face that's a gift of faith so a person then could not say now the Lord shows me you've got this and the Lord shows me you've got that wonder why it is that people tend to gravitate more toward that type than they do the gift of faith or the word of wisdom or the word of knowledge but I don't find Paul listing them in that order which is the greater or which is the Lesser but you see the gift to Faith is something that is definitely going to be more widespread over the world than that prophetic gift which is only given to a prophet to be able to ascend and discern people's hearts notice again he said I've seen oral praying for a little baby Oral Roberts from up in Canada he had a bad eye and I believe the parents was Catholic and brother Roberts in his real way of Faith he slammed his hand down on that little baby and prayed for it and the little baby was healed now that's a real gift of faith that Oral Roberts had yet Oral Roberts was a trinitarian or Roberts was not a theologian or Roberts we know what he wound up being wound up being a compromiser basically as it got older and older in order to build his university and all that sort of Saint he was not a prophet he was not a Vindicated messenger somebody say Amen but yet he did have a gift of faith there were thousands times thousands of people that were healed in Oral Roberts Ministry and he's the one who coined the term of making a point of contact when people that would have a television or radio and they would put their hand for it and touch that he's the one that coined that term and that had many mighty Miracles but did the man discern no he was not a prophet so what did he use he had a gift of faith well you know I believe myself looking at other men that we know in the message that there are men in the message that have a real gift of faith I personally believe brother Daryl ward has a great gift of faith because he prays and he believes and he'll encourage you to go on and he'll tell the people you send me an email or you write me a letter when you're well or you'll give them a prayer cloth and say use mail this back to me whenever you will he's gone about from all over the world because he has a real face to be able to just smack that devil and the devil going down the hill like this he don't know what in the world ever hit him but why is it that a lot of times folks tend to minimize that and think that it's not as great as the Lord showing somebody well I see this or I see that who is it that Diversified that gift and made it greater than the gift of faith anybody answer me I didn't think so now watch this when Paul identifies Faith now he says to another the gifts of healing now Faith is singular word is singular of wisdom word of knowledge singular but when we come to Healing now we have gifts gifts of healing instead of just one gift there is no such a thing as the gift of healing it is Gifts of healing now watch the prophet again said some of those who have great faith in healing that's called Gifts of healing or gift of healing and he says there is no such a thing as the gift of healing because it's in its plural it's gifts so there are Gifts of healing now some of you are really going to wrinkle your nose at me right here but God might drop it in a sister's heart to be able to pray for another sister and she would have an empathy in her soul for that sister maybe more so than her brother would now does that mean that sister's supposed to get her a microphone and start having a prayer line in the back of the church while I'm having one here she'll be set down as she does praise the Lord why because God never called her to start no prayer line but we know from the example the prophet gave us of the woman who had the baby and she was up in the balcony remember the story and she was walking around the baby crying crying crying the woman uh sitting there and she had a seat and this woman didn't have a seat she said honey take my seat don't think no I don't want to do that yeah yeah take my seat and then she sat down and she said sister honey this just keeps coming on my heart to pray for your baby would you mind I know you've got a prayer card and brother random is going to pray for your baby but with you man she said why no dear go right ahead well that little sister prayed for the baby later the prophet brought her upon the platform and she comes across to the prayer line and he looks at her vision breaks forth and said your baby is already healed that woman right back there prayed for your baby and God heard her prayer right then now brother random goes on to tell us that God knew that that mother would have a feeling in her heart for that child you see we've we've done such a discredit by thinking this is only for preachers that it's only for men only like you Mamas and your babies running a fever at home and you can't get a hold of me and you can't get a hold to brother Daryl I'll tell you one person you can get a hold to Heaven he's the only one that matters anyway and that's the Lord Jesus and the Lord could come right there and you lay your little hand right on that baby and say in the name of Jesus Satan I heard our pastor readeth from the word of God leave my child right now in Jesus name I believe it'll happen if you believe it with all your heart Now watch how the prophet takes this and diversifies and he said God works and many different ways to heal the sick and on another quote turns 63 I believe it was he said that God heals by music God heals by surgery God heals by love and he went through several different things that God healed by so there are Gifts of him you say music God remember when all Elisha was in a really bad mood you remember the prophet Elisha and he got in a really bad mood one day and they needed a word from the Lord but he wasn't in no mood to be able to give him no good word from the Lord so he said somebody bring a men's job well that was somebody that played an instrument so they brought the menstrual land that old boy got to plan on that thing and his hands must have been anointed as he was across them strains and whatever it was he is doing and all Elisha just got all calm down and relax and his Spirit got all calmed down on the presence of God and the hand of God moved on that prophet and he begin to give them a word from the Lord after the music come that's exactly why we sing before we preach sometimes we come in here and we're all muddled up in our minds and we've got business deals on our minds and we're worried about this and worried about that we need to get under the anointing and sing a little bit and clap their hands and worship God and get in a right mood how many knows you got to get in the right mood sometimes you've got to get in the right mood in order to be able to get into the service oh my notice the prophet said God works in many ways to heal the sick sometimes preaching the word I've seen it countless of times that whenever you preach and you'll see them sometimes they'll come up here and you'll notice that they'll tell me something and I won't pray for them well most of the time it's them sharing a testimony that while they're setting there in the Pew the Lord healed them or that's talking about that very thing that I preaching when they got dropped in their heart they don't need prayer they just wanted to share the testimony why God healed him when they're sitting right there in their Pew do you believe God can do that sure a preacher don't even have to lay hands on them at all but notice how he goes this way so sometimes the preaching of the word sometimes a neighbor setting by you and just lay his hand over on you feel like he should do so always do that whatever a born-again child of God feels to pray for the sick that's the Holy Spirit moving in you to do so no matter who is going to pray for the person you go ahead and pray for him anyhow well they told me that's going to get brother Donna to pray for him I better not know you better pray for him because the Lord may go ahead and answer your prayer and they'll just tell me God healed them and you prayed for them you see friend I I don't I don't understand I don't understand I just don't understand while we think it's so important that this man or that man or another man gets credit well I prayed for so and so when this happened and I prayed for so-and-so what the world is the matter with us we don't deserve no credit we don't deserve no honor well I prayed for him and I've done this and that and the other My my what difference doesn't mean who prayed for him if God answered prayer and they're better isn't that the most important thing they got healed they got delivered praise God that's what we want [Applause] foreign look at verse 10. now remember gifts are dangerous do you know that you can take a Divine gift and send your soul to hell with it I'll let you Ponder on that for a little bit now verse 10 he says to another thing of Miracles I wonder how many preachers in the message it was offering out the gifts tonight that'd be the first one they'd want why people tend to talk about that more seems to be more visible well y'all get inclined on me to another the working of Miracles the working of Miracles is not is that not a great gift it is absolutely a phenomenal gift but it's not the only one nope so what if a person doesn't need a miracle but they need a word of wisdom so and then they'd go to a preacher that has the ability and God uses him to perform great signs and wonders and miracles but at that present time they're not sick and they don't have uh you know a great Mighty Red Sea that's laying before him they need a word from God they need a word of wisdom and Thomas the Lord tells me there's somebody in the building tonight that's sad wow what discernment the Lord tells me there's somebody here tonight that's got a pain I can't pinpoint it but it's from the crown down to the bottom of the foot somewhere in that general area right there that covers everything don't it oh my goodness to another working of Miracles mama working of Miracles to another prophecy wow now that's a great one ain't it is that great prophecy and you know that prophecy tongues being interpreted is prophecy but that requires a team or the same person can be able to speak in tongues and then interpret what they said which is prophecy but a man or a woman can have prophecy alone prophecy is a standalone gift so the spirit of God could fall on them and they would say thus saith the Lord tomorrow Johnson City a bomb will fall out of a plane and such and such and so and so will happen well if that was God you better run I said you better run now if it wasn't God will all be gathered here on Sunday morning and we'll be trying to figure out how to cover the heart of that person who lied God Don't Lie if God says you're going to go hunting and you're going to do this and that the other it'll happen if God says it's going to rain tomorrow 1201 it'll rain 35 seconds and then it'll stop and then it will come in absolute Deluge for another 47 minutes and 35 seconds mark it down it will happen exactly that way if God don't say it oh you're in trouble because you got a lion Spirit on you dear Jesus look friends God Don't Lie so to one is giving the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits now listen carefully so one is called by God to work miracles another is called by God to prophesy another is called to discern spirits but now remember this is not the prophetic gift of discernment ah he didn't know there's a difference huh well you're fixing to find it out this is exactly as it says Discerning of spirits you know what amazes me is that Samantha message preachers preach this message and preach by the brand there's a prophet and this and that and the other and they'll take all they'll take his quotes on the Rapture they'll take his quotes on the Seven Seals they'll take his quotes on women cutting their hair and they'll take his quotes on this and that and the other but when it comes to the gifts it's not they think somehow brother Bram didn't what he's talking about well that don't make a lick of sense to me if I can't trust his teaching on the gifts how can I know I entrusted teaching on the rapture how can I trust his teaching on the Holiness and a lot of the other things if I can't trust his teaching on the gifts well come on somebody [Applause] so watch now Paul is wanting the church at Corinth and of course Paul knew that it was more than the Church of Corinth he knew that this would be no doubt read for countless of Ages so he wants them to be able to see what God wants to do in the body now remember the body of Christ reflects the mind of Christ what God wants the body doing on the earth in his stead shows what he thought about the body it's not what you and I think God wants us to do it's not what the church world thinks God wants us to do it's what God Said himself this is what I want my church to do in my absence I want you all to carry out my work the same way I did well can you understand that Jesus had all of this Jesus operating the gift of faith Jesus operating the word of wisdom the word of knowledge he operated and all this Jesus spoke in tongues on the cross and Jesus was able to discern spirit so all of this come from the great fountain at one time he said only one no doubt that it will ever be that way and then God Through the Ages he will disperse these gifts down through time and they were lost during the church ages what was the Pentecostal message a restoration of the gifts how many of them but what did mostly Pentecost emphasize tongues interpretation prophecy so that's the only three they got I've always wondered myself that Jack and hoped before I left this world or before the Rapture came that would be true scriptural manifestations of this word of God now either we believe it's still the word of God like it was when Paul wrote it oh we have to say well well now that that ain't no more says who the prophet said these things should be in every local body well praise the Lord Discerning of spirits Discerning of spirits now if I would ask here tonight how many people knows what this means no doubt the answer would be Diversified uh I'm sure that some would say I know what it means I know what it means it's this man calling this person out and and telling them this and the other are you sure Discerning of spirits now Peter by this gift discerned the ananias had lied to the Holy Ghost now remember if it could be taken like that Peter was using prophetic discernment but he was not he was not a prophet you see this prophetic discernment of the son of man it's only to be one in a generation only one [Music] only one but Discerning of spirits is a gift that's to be of the body which is not the prophetic gift boy you all are sure looking at me funny have I got something on my face I mean I thought I wiped my face off now once Discerning of spirits it does not use the word discernment but Discerning of spirits what does it do what does the word discern to see right from wrong so Discerning of spirits is not somebody standing up with discernment I'm sorry that is the wrong meaning of the word Hallelujah so Peter could tell by Discerning of spirits when he looked at an eyes you have lied to the Holy Ghost [Music] and they packed him out a dead man right Safara come in same thing Discerning of spirits and said you have also lied to the Holy Ghost and the men that Pat your husband out are standing at the door and they will pack you out now he did not tell her what her name was then tell her what a street address was he did not read her thoughts or read her mind he was Discerning the spirit this is a church gift that belongs in the body of Christ amen but this is not a prophetic gift now look at me funny if you want to you know I wouldn't be saying this if I didn't have it in front of me sometimes I like to check you out and see how much you know how much you think you know anyway so Discerning of spirits oh do we need it yes yes yes we still need Discerning of spirits if we would allow the Lord he would help us to keep from getting hurt a lot of times by people that ain't got the right Spirit anyhow and if he could be able to flow through us oh my now you remember also there was another example now remember Peter was a great man but Peter was not a prophet he was not a church-aged messenger even though he preceded Paul he did not have the gift that Paul had praise the Lord now watch in Acts chapter 8 verse 18. there was a man by the name of Simon I'm on Simon saw that through the langon of the Apostles hands the Holy Ghost was given he offered them money never remember this man had become supposedly converted under Philip the evangelist now apparently Philip did not have this this gift of discerning of spirits so this man says he believes the Lord he's accepted the message and he's hanging around the message Church but Peter has already been used by God to discern spirits so watch when Simon saw that through the landline of the Apostle stands the Holy Ghost was given he offered them money now watch here Peter and them they laid their hands on the people and they received the Holy Ghost and this Simon Magus is his name Simon Magus so Simon says hey hey I'll pay you for that I'll give you money I want that same thing now remember this guy was hanging around and he was uh he had been a magician so he'd been working in the realm of demonology in witchcraft so he wanted this and Peter that thing struck him again oh mom won't you listen what he said give me also this power that on whomsoever I lay hands he may receive the holy ghost that sounds like a real desire don't it but it was as selfish as the Devil Himself now once you notice what Peter's response was oh brother brother we're all so full of love around here we don't never say nothing harsh to nobody oh brother ah not brother Peter he was rough on a corn cob and Peter said unto him thy money perish with thee because thou has thought the gift of God may be purchased with money thou Hast neither part nor locked in this matter for thy heart oh the heart is not right in the sight of God boy that's a mouthful how are you going to be able to tell what's in a man's heart Discerning of spirits your heart ain't right you ain't got no power and yet no doubt Philip went back to town said glory to God I'll tell you what I was over here preaching there's a magician God saved Oh Glory to God I'll tell you one thing out there testifying Hallelujah to God man a lot you talking about a meat we had all for one office meetings ever was I ever seen in my life that magician come by prayer he'd give his heart to the Lord Lord glory to God I was in South Africa a few years ago I'm talking about me I never been a message preacher there in front of me oh it's just a few weeks had been to this certain certain place and I done heard them coming back let's talking about bragging boy we've witnessed to the message of this certain certain guy we baptized him he was on fire with the Holy Ghost and I was there about two weeks after that he was still drinking he was still smoking he was still wearing his short britches around like a little girl he was still doing this and that and the other and they was going all over the states bragging about what God had done for us and that's the way a lot of preachers are they ain't nothing but a bagel in I'll tell you one thing if you ever get a hold to Jesus the drinking will go the cigarettes will go the short one will go the lion will go the cheating will go you will be a changed person wow Peter said break it of this thy wickedness and pray God if perhaps I mean he's hanging him over hell and not sure there's even any Mercy left for him perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven well Peter sure wouldn't make a good layout of sin would he imagine oh no matter what you've done it don't mean no difference you can cuss God you can buy same one whatever we're all going to heaven no way you owe my you son of the devil yourself preached such lies and Damned them people to hell no we ain't all going to heaven there's only one way and that way is Jesus Christ and you cannot come the lust the father draws you to that way wow repent therefore this thy wickedness and pray God if perhaps the thought of thy heart may be forgiven me how could he say this in such a forceful assertive way it wasn't just his gift to preach God had used him in Discerning of spirits and this man's own mouth this man's own behavior showed who is still on the throne of his heart don't you see what God wants the body to become to a child of God filled with the Holy Ghost the body is a servant to the soul the body becomes that's what it is when you're a sinner the body is a servant to the nature of the Soul on your lost so the body fulfills whatever the soul wants if the soul wants to drink if it wants to lie whatever it wants to do the body just goes ahead and does it and when a person is born again the same thing ought to happen again except you got a new master on the throne of your heart and then the body becomes a servant hey body I'm going to clap my hands my soul ain't got none well here you go here's mine go ahead and clap them boy I want to dance a little bit well here's my feet go ahead and dance I want to shout I want to worship God I want to go to church and the body said yes sir yes sir yes sir [Applause] whew watch these words verse 23 for I perceive oh here we go how did he perceive by Discerning of spirits the thou are in the gall of bitterness I'll tell you one thing he preached rougher to this guy in four verses and a lot of church folks here in 40 years didn't he he stripped him down laid him bare right before hell and hung him right there by a string and said buddy you better repent fast and you better get back to God I hope there's Mercy for you you imagine this old boy shook her he was scared he totally to death he said oh pray for me pray for me Peter why he did not need a Word of Wisdom he did not need a word of knowledge he did not need Miracles he did not me well somebody preached with me tonight what did he need the summoning of spirits to say man you need to be set free from that evil thing I think we'll still need it don't you I want you to know Simon's response let me finish verse 23 for I perceive the Thou Art and the gall of bitterness and then the bond of iniquity in other words you ain't nothing but a make-believer boy you better get your ass straightened out quick I just hope there's Mercy for you I'm not sure there's even an ounce left well if Peter would have said that to a man who wanted to be able to have the gift of God to give the Holy Ghost out I wonder what he'd do to a bunch of these make-believing preachers and the denominations and so on today Lord have mercy they probably wouldn't let Peter he wouldn't be able to preach five minutes in the Pulpit would he I wonder how many of our message churches Peter will be able to preach in his Senator preaching about the gall of bitterness and God biting and doing this and that and I said what no why does it matter to you all bunch of people I thought you all believed the apostolic doctrine that me and Paul and James and Matthew Prince you folks are about your pansies you're a bunch of weaklings you got your feelings out on your shoulder and if the preacher don't shake your hand you ain't coming back what the world's a matter with you all you all need to get that same holy ghost that we got on the day of Pentecost and helped us to die for it it helped us to live for it we've raised The Dead We heal the sick we cast out Devils we discern spirits and it'll do the same for you thank you we'd all be sitting in here and say dear Jesus let me show them some of y'all been watching the pastor and said what's brother Donnie said his brother died not in his head if he knows he's dead I'm Gonna Know the brother Donald's got that peculiar look in his face I'm gonna have that peculiar looking mine you imagine these boys they didn't play they didn't play they wasn't there to rub people on the head they was there to tell them the truth um now notice Simon's response then answered Simon and said pray ye to the Lord for me now prior to this discerning he wanted to buy the Holy Ghost so he could give it out and after this Discerning of spirits he didn't even feel worthy to pray wow did God give the man what he needed a good rebuking oh you imagine somebody's allowed to send pictures they said come on in brother how much money you got well we got this gift on sale this week we got it on sale this week but I ain't got but 24 995. that's exactly the price tag hallelujah thank you Lord you know brother nothing from nothing leaves nothing so you've got to have gifts you've got to buy into God's gifts or if you need a miracle in your hour pray and we'll send you this holy anointed blue raspberry body armor the man of God has touched it and rubbed that precious Holy Ghost swear all over that bottle and we'll sell it to you for ten thousand dollars I'll let you have this and for free Holy Ghost sweat whoever heard of such nonsense there ain't no such thing as Holy Ghost sweat my sweat stinks just like yours does there's only one holy thing among us and that's the Mighty God that ain't the holy preacher it ain't the holy church it's the Holy Ghost [Applause] [Music] huh so Paul says to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues huh diverse kinds of tongues now I know there are tongues of men and there are tongues of angels I know all the message folks don't even believe in tongues no more yes you do that one that causes you so much trouble is cutting the middle and tied on both ends it's the best one some of y'all seem like you got two or three times the way you gab and Goss it and carry them [Music] [Applause] are you taking us oh Lord have mercy you've taken us back to Pentecost oh dear God don't tell me we're going back to 1906. no no no no no no no no we're going way further back than 1906. we're going back to Acts chapter two we're the original Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost not just the restoration of gifts but the undoing of the power of God that changes Our Lives diverse kinds of tongues some of these tongues will be interpreted and some won't some will be intended for prayer only you alone with God and the Holy Ghost will begin to speak out of you you said why in the world would he do that I reckon because he figures I ain't smart enough to know what to say so he's going to take over my tongue and say what I need to say well don't sit there and look at me some of y'all don't know what to pray a bit more than I do Paul even said sometimes he'll utter things that can't even be articulated how does he do it by groanings in the spirit so he said oh oh people say Lord have mercy that ain't praying read your Bible a little closer sometimes you don't even know the words to say nobody know what I'm talking about when you get down then you're just groaning and groaning and groaning and what is it the spirit of God and then maybe all of a sudden you'll break forth and speak in a language you never talked in your life and then you may talking that for a bit and then Break Forth into another and into another well come on somebody why because the Bible says God will find the way over God do that ask him I'm just the Mailman to another the interpretation of tongues so the person that is an interpreter if they're a genuine interpreter and I'm speaking in Arabic which I have or in Hebrew which I have or Italian which I have or Spanish which I have and German which I have well you say I didn't know you was that smart I ain't I don't even speak good English must I say anything else brother Tony no no no don't tell me don't tell me you speak your truth I just told you and I'm not ashamed of it I said I'm not ashamed anybody else in here that's not ashamed to say well yeah glory to God every now and then I do too I'm surprised that some of you that do oh Lord have mercy glory to God I've never thought of previous loser would ever talked in tongues I never thought all the previous Baptist or a Church of Christ whoever talk 10 times but that's what the Holy Ghost does once he gets a hold of you he throws looserness about the window he throws Catholicism out the window why because God says I want somebody even in the message that I can get their mouths what language do you speak brother beside English come here I'm going to say it English you're speaking in Swahili the Lord Jesus Christ Lo loves you and our Panda he died for you he come down from heaven how many understands what he's saying ah thank you so to the rest of us it's Swahili or Greek or French I mean we wouldn't know the difference now how could he interpret what I said because he also speaks and hears English so tongues that are to be interpreted they will speak in whatever language and a person with the gift of interpretation will hear it just like he heard it and he'll bring it for us in that language and others are sitting there saying what in the world is he talking about what in the world is he saying you see that's why that the Bible and the prophet goes right along when teaching them the same thing that without an interpreter in the church lets him hold their peace people get up speak in tongues and speak in tongues and speak in tongues and we sit here and we sat there and we sat here and nothing happens that person's supposed to hold their peace and tell them whenever you're praying and tell them when you come up you know on the Alder and all that and the Holy Ghost is all over you I'm talking about one of the interruption service or even at the end of the service and people stand and speak in tongues and speak in tongues and speak in tongues and nothing ever comes out of it let him hold his peace or her hold hers except there being an interpreter then an interpreter will hear it exactly as my brother heard my English and translated it into Swahili so if it'd been the opposite and I was up there speaking in tongues and Swahili and he had the gift of interpretation he'd be able to stand up yes the Lord Jesus loves you he came down from heaven I spoke in Swahili and he heard it and he gave it to you to make it understandable so the world wouldn't think we're more crazy than what they already do anybody here believe in this [Applause] verse 11 but all these work us that one and self-same spirit dividing to every man several is his will verse 27. now you're the body of Christ and members in particular I love this word particular part portion apart do or assigned to one a lot of Destiny and a measure so God chose to do it this way in order to reveal his mind in the body so the body would act out the mind of Christ so the body of Christ is the servant to the soul of Christ I don't go over your head now remember what the prophet tells us and so is in prison now about that soul a soul of God in 1965 he tells us the soul of God that was in God before the foundation of the world Christ Jesus should be the soul of our church the soul of Our Lives the soul of everything we are that what are we the body of Christ that we are a servant to our soul which is our master glory to God can I have a few more minutes First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 28. God set some in the church first apostles secondarily Prophets thirdly teachers after that Miracles then gifts notice again Paul of healings helps uh helps helps would rather be Apostles and Prophets and but how can you run a church without helps but who wants to be helps if people don't want to be a prophet they want to be the next word governments they want to run the church diversities of tongues now did the New Testament Church have and believe in Prophets that's how the Bible said the law and the prophets were unto John you see these poor Knuckleheads that have left the message and try to use that scripture to disqualify brother Branham or disqualifying the book of Acts when they do it they're so ignorant they don't even realize the law was the Torah and the prophets was identified from the first five books of Moses on down to Malachi that's the way it's referred to over and over and over again in the Bible the law and the prophets so the first five books of Moses and from there on over to the Book of Malachi so it was identifying it was not excluding prophets from the New Testament and somebody said [Applause] Acts chapter 11 verse 27. and in these days came after John came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch so did the New Testament Church believe in Prophets but now remember these are Church Prophets it's not the church age messenger he's not on the scene yet in his office and there stood up one of them named agabus and signified by the spirit that there should be a great nurse throughout all the world I love this so Luke writes the prophecy and then tells the time when it was fulfilled which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar that was this man a great preacher we don't know what's this man an evangelist we don't know was this man a church-aged messenger he was not that I do know did he even write any books I've never found one in history or church history well he ever wrote anything he was known in the book of Acts by two prophecies but he was called a prophet now this is not like Paul you understand now what's there Acts chapter 21 verse 10. and as we tear down many days there came down from Judea a certain Prophet named agabus now this is Again Luke writing about him traveling with Paul and when he was coming to us he took Paul's girdle and bound his own hands and feet and said thus saith the Holy Ghost so shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that only this girdle and shall deliver him unto the hands of the Gentiles now it doesn't even sound like he even knew who Paul was but watch how he's acting out in a symbolism as an Old Testament Prophet but he never gave us any books there's no book of agabus there's no letter that he wrote to any church but he was a new testament prophet and when we heard these things both we and they of the place besought him not to go to Jerusalem so they hear agabus prophesy this and they tell Paul please don't don't go watch Paul and then Paul answered and said what mean you to weep and to break my heart for I am ready not to be bound only but also to die Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus oh my God now look with me in chapter 12 verse 29 are all apostles answer listen me are all apostles no are all prophets no are all teachers are all workers of Miracles have all the gifts of healing but I want you to notice they are still part of the all now he's not talking about the world and comparing the prophets the apostles the gifts of healing but he's talking about the body so is everybody in the body a prophet no that's everybody on the prophet or an apostle no there's everybody in the body have the gift of Miracles no but they're in the body and nobody can take your place the greatest Miracle Worker that there is Among Us cannot take your place or take your crown that God's ordained for you to wear notice this are all teachers no our own workers and miracles have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues so you mean we're still talking about people in the body and Paul didn't believe everybody in the body had to speak with tongues do all interpret now let me go on and say this do all see visions no huh what was the commission that Jesus gave to his church in Mark 16 17. and these signs shall follow them that belief in my name they shall cast out Devils take up serpents which Paul did on the aisle of course that was not a snake handling church now and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover so the commission to the church never included visions shouting jumping running but we believe in all of that do we not no wonder why Jesus wouldn't use that as a sign that so well ever believer will have a vision because he knew they would not but this would be among the Believers size following casting out Devils raising the dead whatever believer do it no you won't some of y'all let the devil beat you over the head because you ain't never done this and that and the other it ain't your place too remember Florence shakiran coming to brother Brown and she said brother Branham I fasted and fasted and fasted and cast out Devils he said sister Florence you wasn't called to do such you was called to fast for them whose call to cast out devils you see once we find that spot then godliness with contentment is great gain then you won't let the devil beat you over there well you never spoken like brother Donnie speaks in tongue to brother so and so to well look at so-and-so they stand up and lay their hands on the set and they say look devil shut your mouth if God wants me to speak in tongues he'll give it to me if I believe it if he wants me to lay my hands on the sick he'll give it to me and you shut your mouth trying to torment me because I'm going to be what God made me be thank you how many police and visions Acts chapter 2 verse 17 and it shall come to pass in the last day say of God I will pour out of my spirit on All Flesh your sons and your daughter shall prophesy your young men not limited now to Prophets this type vision your young men shall see visions and your old man shall dream dreams acts 9 verse 10. and there was a certain disciple at Damascus notice it doesn't even say he's a preacher now a disciple named ananias and to him said the Lord in a inhibition ananias and he said behold I am here Lord and the Lord said in him arise and going to the street which is called straight and inquire in the house of Judas for One Call Saul of terseus for behold he prays and have seen in a vision a man named ananias so Paul ain't even got saved yet as we'd call Sage Sanctified baptized filled with the Holy Ghost he's just praying you mean this man saw a vision and he didn't even have the Holy Ghost yet this man saw a vision and he just now come straight off the street from con you know absolutely condemning the Believers and blaspheme in the name of the Lord Jesus and the Lord shows the man is this your Bible now is this a prophetic Vision no is this an end time messenger Vision no Hello friends I'm sorry you didn't know this is in your Bible can it go on are you sure Acts chapter 10 verse 1. there was a certain man in caesarea called Cornelius Cornelius was a Roman Centurion of the Italian band not saved not Sanctified not baptized and listen what happened to this matter Centurion of the band that was called the Italian band a devout man under the law now doing everything he knew to do but he still wasn't safe one that feared God and out his house which gave much arms to the people and prayed to God that sounds like a good church member don't it he saw in a wow so you mean a person could actually see a vision and not be a prophet but it wouldn't be a vision the way it would come to a problem now remember the Bible tells us in the Old Testament and the word of the Lord was precious in those days because there was no open vision you see this is why God used prophets in this way because when God but showed them a vision they're so made where they cannot listen they cannot say anything wrong in that vision the word of the Lord comes through the vision and the vision is infallible now you said you believed what Paul wrote right well according to the Bible every word is supposed to be established in the mouth of two or three Witnesses so show me at least one more that wrote about the nine gifts of the Spirit preachers can be a smart addicts sometimes but yet you believe Paul had the inspiration of God now do you need another writer in the New Testament before you're going to believe what Paul said about the gifts what Paul said about women in their hair he's the only one that wrote about it you're going to believe what Paul said in the book of Hebrews about many of the types and the Shadows of the Old Testament you mean you're going to take one man's word for it let's apply that same principle to Moses coming down off the law when Moses said off the mountain with the law of God when Moses said God brought that with his own finger of course two more witness to say God did but you see God so hones them prophets in their gift is not the same as Discerning of spirits in the church that one can hit or Miss let's stand [Applause] let me read the rest of this of Cornelius he saw on a vision evidently about the nine Tower of the day an angel of God coming into him and sang unto him Cornelius and when he looked on him he was afraid and he said what is it Lord and he said unto him thy prayers and thine arms are come up for a memorial before God Acts chapter 10 verse 9. and on memorials they went on the Journey of June 9 to the city Peter went up to the house top to pray about the sixth hour and he became very hungry and it would have eaten but while they made ready he fell into a trance strange that he didn't use the same word vision look at what the word trance means I thought that was absolutely rapturous a man who by some sudden emotion is transported as it were out of himself so that in this wrapped wrapped r-a-p-t Rapture wrapped this is the kind of rap I believe that hahaha I'm a holy ghost rapper so a man by some means is carried out of himself in this wrapped condition although he is awake his mind is drawn off from all surrounding objects and wholly fixed on things divine that he sees nothing but the forms and images lying Within wow but what's amazing to me is when God Appears to Cornelius in this Vision it's as plain and simple as it can be when God Appears to Paul it's as plain and simple but I want you notice when God Appears to Peter and he saw heaven opened and a certain vessel descending unto him as it had been a great sheet knit or tie that at the Four Corners and let down to the Earth for him or all manner of four-footed Beast of the Earth wild beast and creeping things and files of the air this trance is full of symbols Cornelius didn't say nothing about having no symbols at all ananias didn't say nothing about having no symbols neither did Paul's have any symbols they say wonder why in the world the lord shows symbols to use Peter must him in God's way of dealing with him it's kind of a stubborn sort of a guy you know hard-headed and the Lord really had to convey him about this and there came a voice to him rise Peter kill and eat but Peter said not so Lord for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean and the voice back on him again the second time what God has cleansing called not thou caught this was down Thrice see what I'm saying anybody being stubborn hard-headed isn't this amazing a gentile saw one vision and it was enough ananias was sent to a man that they knew was guilty of killing Christians God didn't have to send him three he sent him one but it happens to Peter three times now while Peter gathered in himself what this is and which he had seen should mean behold the men which were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon's house and stood before the gates so Peter's trying to figure what in the world God wants me to eat shrimp Lord have mercy God wants me to crap he wants me to eat Gunk and Goose Lord certainly the goodness that wasn't a hog Peter you don't know what them Baconator sandwiches is like man I'm telling you boy you imagine God showing him and Peter's saying what in the world is a matter with me this couldn't be the Holy Ghost this couldn't be God but it was somebody's sitting there pondering and thinking Lord you mean I've got to start eating pork ribs hogged out Lord have mercy the brothers will kill me they'll throw me out of the church and while he's thinking on it some old boys downstairs knocking on the door said you all got a man here by the name of Peter yeah it just so happens we do the Lord God sent us Hallelujah the men which were sent from Cordelia you said made inquiry at Simon's house and stood before the gate and called and asked whether Simon which was surname Peter lodged there while Peter thought on the vision the spirit said unto him behold three men seek them now you see that isn't the same thing as a prophetic gift let me just give you this some of y'all will die if I don't give it to you for Wednesday night you'll be panicking three Witnesses in 1951 the prophet said there's a gift in the Church of discernment that's true but a prophetic gift is ordained before the foundation of the world greater than Solomon I want you to know my brothers and sisters you don't have to wait for some special advances to come no no your pastor has the same now he may not be able to have that prophetic gift that comes what'd he say one and a generation ah one and a generation this is why I'm not looking for a Malachi four and a half I'm not looking for another Prophet to come if you all feel sorry for you why we've done got the one that we needed is that right now he said but look he has the same rights to pray for you that I would that discernment doesn't heal you it only brings you God conscious that you're in the presence of God again now believe what I'm praying I'm going to pray for you in these passages see I don't want to leave the town people think well the Evangelist is here he did this I want you to know your pastor has the same Authority he might not see visions that may become one but he's got the same Authority from God you know brother Branham said brother Billy Paul saw these Visions just like him as a matter of fact brother REM said they'd be going down the road and Betty Paul would say there'll be a certain certain place he'll go around this curve and brothers and say stop let me finish it so Billy but see part of it and brother Brandon would tell the rest of it brother Adam said if he would commit himself to God we would be running two prayer lines you know I said that well he did it's amazing how those gifts can run in families and land on somebody that's not even called to do it I better close right now I'm as happy you come to church tonight the rest of you wish they'd went to Walmart huh and a rich another one now I want you to know my brothers sisters you don't have to wait for some special evanges to come he may not be able to have the prophetic gift that comes one or a generation now notice a greater than Solomon evangelist goes in town does all the praying all the baptizing then the people when he leaves well the pastor think their Pastor is nothing yeah your pastor is a man of God he said he lets you safe this far he can take you on he's an instructed man of God again he says identification of God has always been knowing can foresee what it's been until what it's been how it is and what it will be well that's how the prophets was known that's how Jesus was known as the Messiah he's the same Messiah today only without a Corporal body here on Earth he sent the spirit back to use your body and my body now you might not be able to do this we know in the scripture there is one in a generation trial Topeka I don't say your pastor or anybody will be taking this gift of discernment they don't have to do that that's not their calling that's not he repeats it that's not they're calling to do that that's to be one in an age you say oh my goodness without ought to relieve every one of us none of us has to try to be like brother Bradham no preacher no evangelist no teacher none of us would just be what God made us and that's all we have to answer for and the church said and they loves him with all your heart God bless you let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we know it's an amazing thing how people are it was the Curiosity of Eve in the Garden of Eden about her position that begin to pull her into questions and pull her into a sphere that she did not belong in that she stayed in her place mind her own businesses would say we certainly wouldn't be where we are today the Lord is that Curiosity and it still works on people today father I pray in the name of Jesus you would help each of us there's Minister standing here tonight Lord there's deacons and trustees and lay folks and all kinds of people that will stream this and I pray that she'd help each of us to be able to find what you want us to be and Lord if it's a housewife if it's a farmer if it's a factory worker a painter an electrician a musician a cook Chef whatever it is Lord a nurse a doctor would just be what you've gifted us to be we do it faithfully and we'll answer to you at that day all we know Satan will always try to make us compare ourselves but we'll look at it in a week or so that Paul said they that compare themselves by themselves or among themselves are not wise so he said we compare according to the rod that God has measured Us by so Paul believed there was an allotment even to preachers they were given boundaries they were given a call they were given gifts and they themselves were to work in the confines of what you had given them Lord May each of us tonight realize that Lord some people feel so bad because they see others shouting and they don't shout and they think God must not love me I must not have got anything Lord boy they may not shout tonight maybe Sunday will be their time and it may be a week it may be a month but Lord we always want to be like the next person Ephraim grows corn we think we ought to grow corn Reuben grows cane we think we ought to go Cain oh Lord help us just to be what you've called us to be Lord God we love you today we're asking father that should forgive us of our Wasted Years of our wasted moments and weeks Lord God that we founded around our time thinking and wishing we were this and that and the other Lord and may we just find what you want us to be and be that Faithfully with all of our hearts Lord help us we love you tonight father how many let you be remembered that way before the Lord oh Hallelujah some of you may not be a preacher that will go out and preach great conventions some of you may not be a preacher that'll preach full time and maybe be gone 25 30 weekends a year you may not preached about a half a dozen dozen times a year but if that was my gift I'd rather preach that and be faithful than to try to make myself something that I'm not and if God's calls you to preach 30-week weeks out of the year you better not sit down buddy and try to preach five because you'll get in trouble Jonah it's so hard for us to just find what God has made us to be and somehow be satisfied I know it may sound crazy to you but a lot of the folks who God's attribute to them a small portion they want to be greater and most of the ones that I know personally that God has laid on them a great load and a great responsibility and a great burden they would to God it wasn't theirs they want to be less it's amazing how we are isn't it we either want to be less than what God made us to be or more than what God made us to be is there anybody that just wants to be what God made us to be brother brother Don do you fight that yep I'm that other guy I'm that other guy I wish nobody knew my name I wish people around the world didn't know me if it's looked up to me you think I'd still be here no I'll be down in Monticello Kentucky where I started that little church about 1982. that's still where I'd be I was down there I was as happy as I could be nobody hardly knew me I come with a message once your brother Charlie Cox at church then brother started meeting me and from there the trouble started I was so happy oh my goodness we just went to church and we thought my goodness glory to God I thought we was at the end I thought was probably the last ones to come to the message now you are you're so ignorant I just thought we was the last once I went to the bank and borrowed a bunch of money went to Jeffersonville and bought up as much tapes as I could afford I started listening to them day and night day and night day and night landing the message and then somebody heard me preach and then somebody else and then somebody else and you know the rest of the start and you think I want that I told God just the other day I said why didn't you leave me alone why don't you just leave me alone just leave me in Kentucky and leave me alone you say brother Tony would you say that yes I'm being totally honest why I don't want to be hated and despised I don't want to be there another portal Nets I mean poor old good brothers that they want to be this and they say are you out of your mind I'll tell you one thing a man that wants to be a pastor either he's called or he's out of his mind a man that wants to be a preacher he's either out of his mind or genuinely called I think that's what it is brother Jack oh children let God help us that God help us that we can get in our sight remember Joel prophesied about this Army he said they would not break their ranks there won't be one person going in the Rapture who will break Divine ranks and make the rapture because the prophecy does not allow breaking of ranks if they're supposed to be here they better be here if they're supposed to be there they better be there if they're supposed to be there they better be there that's part of them knowing who God is and knowing who they are praise the Lord Harry get us out of this mess saying something that'll lift them up don't you love him with all your hearts we've got a couple that's going to be baptized tonight my goodness I'll tell you what I don't have anybody would be baptized since we've been here and it's been wonderful absolutely wonderful what the Lord is doing let's just worship him a little bit together now just meditate on these things you young Brothers young sisters all of us what's God wants you to do what's God called you today you may not know right now maybe six months maybe a year maybe two well what am I supposed to do until that time read your Bible pray come to church see a piece of paper on the parking lot pick it up well you say my goodness let me tell you one thing I try preachers when they say they're called to preach and if they're too big to preach at a youth service they ain't taking a Sunday morning service for me they're too big for the britches already if you can't start on the bottom you'll break your neck trying to climb the ladder at the top well come on now if a man's called to preach he'll preach to one if he has to is that right because you know that God has a call for you and you're willing to start at the bottom and work your way up that's the way God does it praise the Lord sing Harry sing praise the Lord just worship him together now more love yes Lord more power sing and worship more of you in mind in my life More Love more power more of you in my life Jesus I need more love more power more of
