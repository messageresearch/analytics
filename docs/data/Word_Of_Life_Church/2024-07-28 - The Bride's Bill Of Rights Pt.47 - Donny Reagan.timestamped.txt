[42:20] going to get worse and worse and worse
[42:22] is it not people decorating their bodies
[42:25] with tattoos I'm not sure exactly what
[42:27] that's supposed to mean and yet the
[42:29] world is is in a state that it's never
[42:32] been before and I ain't never been any
[42:34] closer to Jesus in my entire life and
[42:38] I'm ready myself and if you're not you
[42:41] can get that way today before you
[42:44] leave how many's ready amen God bless
[42:48] your heart that is the greatest thing
[42:50] you could ask for if you're flat broke
[42:52] today and you ain't got enough money to
[42:54] buy a hamburger after church but you're
[42:56] ready to meet God you're better off than
[42:58] a
[43:00] billionaire that's right cuz tell me you
[43:03] ever seen any Millionaire's caskets full
[43:06] of money gold stocks
[43:10] bonds BMWs
[43:13] Mercedes you ever seen any of that
[43:15] Lamborghinis me either a't that strange
[43:17] wonder who gets it their kids are
[43:18] fussing and fighting over
[43:21] it but all my how many have I walked in
[43:24] front of and led them in that
[43:27] last stage of their journey and I'm
[43:31] fixing to say them words drop them down
[43:33] in that ground they might not have had
[43:35] enough money to even bury theirself that
[43:39] people had to help bury
[43:41] them but you talking about a soul that
[43:44] was ready to meet God Amen that is what
[43:46] it's all about
[43:48] friends let's turn this morning if you
[43:50] would to Matthew chapter 8
[43:54] verse4 how is in love of Jesus to today
[43:58] with all your
[44:00] heart and when Jesus was coming to
[44:03] Peter's
[44:05] house he saw his
[44:07] wife's mother
[44:10] laid and sick of a
[44:15] fever and he touched her
[44:18] hand and the fever left her what power
[44:23] so here somebody's sick they got a fever
[44:26] Jesus just walks in in he doesn't even
[44:29] pray he just touched her on the hand why
[44:32] the hand I don't know joury us as humans
[44:36] Where Do We Touch people that have a
[44:38] fever on their forehead right yeah so oh
[44:43] yeah yeah you you've got a fever you've
[44:44] got a fever Jesus touched her on the
[44:48] hand now watch the
[44:51] significance he touched her
[44:54] hand and the fever
[44:57] left
[44:59] her and she
[45:03] arose and
[45:05] ministered unto
[45:08] them so you reckon Peter's mother-in-law
[45:10] grabbed a Torah the Bible was with North
[45:13] the Old Testament and took a text and
[45:16] said now Jesus sit down I'm going to
[45:18] preach to
[45:20] you
[45:22] no but she ministered to them food
[45:27] and
[45:28] drink where did Jesus touch
[45:31] her the Avenue she's going to
[45:34] use
[45:35] amen and she Rose and ministered unto
[45:39] them 1 Corinthians chapter 16 verse
[45:44] 15 I beseech you Brethren you know the
[45:48] house of
[45:50] stepanus that it is the first fruits of
[45:53] aaya and these are the first converts
[45:56] that Paul was able to lead to the Lord
[45:58] in this city of
[46:01] aayat that they have
[46:06] addicted
[46:08] themselves to the ministry of the
[46:13] Saints now here's the type of
[46:16] addict I want to
[46:18] be people are addicted to dope they're
[46:20] addicted to alcohol they're addicted to
[46:23] their cell phone they're addicted to
[46:24] Instagram and Tik Tok and all the rest
[46:27] of the things that are around but this
[46:29] right here is a holy
[46:32] addiction and if you're addicted to this
[46:34] I ain't going to pray that God will get
[46:36] you off I just pray that you'll get
[46:38] around other people and they'll become
[46:40] as addicted as you are
[46:42] amen now watch what an outstanding thing
[46:45] to say now they're not
[46:48] preachers and it didn't say the cast out
[46:51] Devils they walked on water to heal the
[46:54] sick but they found their
[46:58] Ministry and once they found it they
[47:01] become so much a part of it that Paul
[47:04] uses this word the only time it's used
[47:08] to describe people of God that have
[47:10] found what they're supposed to do and
[47:12] when they do it with all of their hearts
[47:15] I beseech you Brethren you know the
[47:17] house of stephanus that is the first
[47:18] fruits of aayah that they have
[47:22] addicted themselves now the Lord was in
[47:25] them but it was actually thems that got
[47:29] addicted it's like the more they did it
[47:32] the more they wanted to and the more
[47:35] they wanted to the more they did and the
[47:38] more they did the more they wanted to
[47:42] that is an addiction right so a person
[47:45] starts out on drugs or whatever it is
[47:47] they do and they take a little bit and
[47:49] then their brain gets used to it because
[47:51] drugs go to that part of your brain that
[47:54] gives you that high and it reproduces is
[47:57] it not in a natural way the way your
[47:59] body is made to releasing the endorphins
[48:02] in your body and then your body gets
[48:05] used to it so you have to have more then
[48:07] you take that dose your body gets used
[48:09] to it the endorphins don't excite you no
[48:12] more it's a feel-good part about your
[48:15] brain and then you have to have more and
[48:18] more and more what are you you're an
[48:21] addict look at what these Saints did and
[48:24] they have addicted themselves to the
[48:27] ministry of the Saints look at me with
[48:30] the meaning of this
[48:32] word
[48:34] deonia now this is the Greek word that
[48:36] we get the word Deacon
[48:40] from Deacon deacons in the Bible were
[48:45] not necessarily
[48:47] preachers they were not men who
[48:49] necessarily cast out Devils now they
[48:51] have to be apt to teach of course but
[48:54] they weren't actually in the ministry in
[48:58] the part of Peter James John Bartholomew
[49:01] Matthew all the rest of those brothers
[49:03] so whenever the needs come up up among
[49:06] the widows and the fatherless then the
[49:08] preachers is having to leave that and
[49:10] take care of them and they said you know
[49:12] what this is not good we need to seek
[49:14] out some brethren that are among us that
[49:16] are filled with the spirit of God and
[49:18] they will be able to minister to the
[49:21] needs of the people and this is the word
[49:23] they chose to use deonia so it is
[49:27] deacons also the same word used for this
[49:29] type of ministry and it means
[49:33] service ministering the service of those
[49:37] who
[49:39] prepare and present food you mean to
[49:42] tell me
[49:43] somebody that would fix a meal for a
[49:48] sister in the church that had surgery or
[49:51] brothers in the church and they can't be
[49:53] able to do what they need to do and
[49:54] somebody would help them with a meal
[49:57] that's a Ministry according to the Bible
[50:00] it is yeah but why is it we think every
[50:05] Minister has to minister from right
[50:09] here you understand as long as the devil
[50:12] can keep your ministry from you he'll
[50:14] make you feel like you are doing nothing
[50:18] amen and your life is in
[50:21] vain may the Lord bless his word let us
[50:24] pray together
[50:27] Lord Jesus thank you so much for the
[50:30] service thus far the singing and your
[50:32] presence that we've sensed here now Lord
[50:34] we come to the breaking of the word and
[50:37] the bread of life we just pray that
[50:39] you'd speak to us
[50:41] father you see our needs are many today
[50:44] and Lord God we believe that you're a
[50:47] God who knows every desire every request
[50:50] down to the smallest person here that
[50:52] would be
[50:53] me we pray that you would just minister
[50:56] Minister dear God to the sick to the
[50:59] needy to The Afflicted to those who'd
[51:01] like to be here today in the camp
[51:03] because of sickness in their home or
[51:05] various things that they're dealing with
[51:07] father would you help me to get out of
[51:09] the way that I can be able to speak what
[51:13] you've placed upon my heart shut my
[51:15] mouth to anything that would displease
[51:17] you Lord speak to us the words of
[51:21] eternal life in Jesus name we pray amen
[51:25] God bless you Saints you may be
[51:32] seated we've been speaking
[51:34] about the
[51:37] bride having so many rights that's given
[51:40] to her by the grace and the mercy of God
[51:44] a right that many of the people of this
[51:47] Earth would not dare to even
[51:50] desire they're more concerned about
[51:52] their rights to kill babies the rights
[51:55] to murder their rights to annihilate and
[51:59] defile your rights you see they don't
[52:02] just want equal rights but they want us
[52:05] to acknowledge their rights and US
[52:08] forfeit ours they believe in free speech
[52:13] as long as it's them speaking freely
[52:15] what they want to speak but we can't
[52:18] speak what we want to speak that's this
[52:21] the way that it is now remember this is
[52:23] all
[52:25] pre-tribulation anointed
[52:27] people that are willing to kill others
[52:31] people that say that Mr Trump uh the guy
[52:35] that shot him that they do wish the guy
[52:37] would not have missed that he would have
[52:40] you probably seen those different clips
[52:41] by people and this is the age and the
[52:44] society that we're in I wouldn't wish
[52:47] that on my greatest enemy whoever they
[52:49] would be and if you do you need to hit
[52:51] this altar before you leave because the
[52:54] spirit of murder is not the spirit of
[52:57] God that's the spirit that was on Cain
[53:00] in the Garden of Eden but God has called
[53:03] us to a higher place and generally the
[53:07] higher God calls you the greater the
[53:10] servitude to him and to his people so
[53:14] it's not the way the world would relate
[53:17] to it that the higher your position is
[53:18] in the world then the more people
[53:21] recognize you and the more people do for
[53:25] you so there lives are centered around
[53:29] you then you become the recipient of all
[53:32] the good things that they have and you
[53:34] are the recipient of their accolades of
[53:37] praise and their love and so on and so
[53:39] on and so on but when it comes to the
[53:41] spirit of God God does the exact
[53:44] opposite of that Jesus said you will not
[53:48] be like the Gentiles were don't seek
[53:51] their position now because the Apostles
[53:54] of course had got into an argument arent
[53:56] coming along the way and they was
[53:59] arguing and fussing over who would be
[54:01] the greatest among them now Jesus said
[54:04] among the Gentiles that's the way they
[54:06] do but then he called him a little child
[54:09] and he set the little child there and
[54:11] said except you become as humble and
[54:14] converted as this little child you would
[54:16] in no wise even see the kingdom of God
[54:20] so let him that is the greatest among
[54:22] you be your servant he said am I not
[54:26] come
[54:27] as the son of man to be your servant you
[54:30] can see why would have totally confused
[54:32] them that never heard a king talk like
[54:36] this before they had never heard of
[54:39] course almighty God veiled in human
[54:41] flesh they never saw this about him in
[54:44] the Old Testament so it was something
[54:47] they had to relearn about greatness
[54:50] because to them it was climbing to the
[54:52] top and each one of them thinking okay
[54:55] you know Peter's going to be the main
[54:56] man Jesus gave him the keys well wonder
[54:59] what I have Jesus never told me I could
[55:01] have keys what do I get well I I don't
[55:04] know what else I'm supposed to get so
[55:06] they're you know they're still arguing
[55:08] and debating over position it's it's sad
[55:10] to say that the same thing is ongoing
[55:14] among Christian people today it happens
[55:16] in a church it happens among preachers
[55:19] you know preachers we we'll talk about
[55:22] well how many hits do you have on your
[55:24] website and how many people people are
[55:27] subscribed to you on YouTube I really
[55:29] don't know how many subscrib to us on
[55:31] YouTube and I really don't care I really
[55:34] that makes no no difference at all to me
[55:37] you've heard me say it before and I'll
[55:38] say it again if it was left up to me
[55:40] would never stream another service I
[55:42] would not be on YouTube I would not be
[55:45] on anywhere in social media I don't do
[55:48] it so that people will know my name I
[55:51] don't do it so that our church people
[55:54] can look up to our church as some great
[55:56] something our church is no more than
[55:58] anybody else's Church we're saved by the
[56:01] grace of God and the church said saved
[56:04] by the grace of God and if we make it
[56:07] and I believe we will it will be the
[56:09] grace of God that does it not our works
[56:11] not because I'm a great man I'm a great
[56:14] flop I am a great failure and I preach
[56:17] to Great failures and my associate
[56:20] ministers here are great failures with
[56:22] me every great preacher in the message
[56:25] is a great
[56:27] failure and without God in our lives we
[56:30] are completely helpless brother Brandon
[56:33] would have been a total failure had not
[56:36] the mercy of God moved on his life
[56:38] whenever God took his wife and his baby
[56:41] he tried to take his own life several
[56:43] times over again and he would have done
[56:46] it had sovereignty not stepped in and
[56:49] not allowed him to do it is that right
[56:51] so what was it the grace of God and
[56:54] brother brandom still is a human being
[56:56] battled with himself on down of course
[56:58] to the end of his life but we know then
[57:01] that becoming into a place to be able to
[57:04] minister that we're called to be married
[57:06] to God we're called to have freedom
[57:08] we're called to have so many wonderful
[57:10] things but we're also called to be in
[57:13] service to our Lord that service can be
[57:17] described by so many and so many
[57:20] different ways so some it will be public
[57:23] acknowledgement to others it would be
[57:25] well I'm going to donate so much but can
[57:28] you name the building after me and if I
[57:31] give so much money can my name be on the
[57:34] founders this and that and the other and
[57:36] you know the sad thing about it is we
[57:38] see this happening in the message so you
[57:40] can generally know whenever a certain
[57:43] person does a certain certain thing and
[57:45] supplies the most of the money in the
[57:47] church because they will name this after
[57:50] him or name this after her or name this
[57:53] well my Bible tells me don't let you
[57:55] laugh hand know what your right hand's
[57:58] doing so that's why here we don't have
[58:01] this certain list on the outside of the
[58:03] wall everybody that gave over a 100,000
[58:06] or everybody that gave over 10,000 will
[58:09] list your name there why would I want to
[58:11] take Heaven's Glory away from you by
[58:14] putting your name on a wall outside that
[58:17] door why would you even want me to but
[58:20] yet there's something about human beings
[58:23] we feel like we have to have that
[58:25] acknowledge M that public something and
[58:28] we want you know we just want people to
[58:30] know what we're doing but yet I love it
[58:33] whenever you can find people that uh
[58:35] recognize their position that God has
[58:38] given them certain abilities for some it
[58:41] will involve public display for many
[58:44] many others it will not be that hardly
[58:47] anybody will know nothing about it
[58:49] there's one of the brothers of our
[58:50] church that had passed a few years ago
[58:53] and at his funeral different people was
[58:55] coming up to his family members and
[58:57] telling them you know he done this and
[59:00] he done that and he done this and he
[59:02] done that and and I knew it myself cuz a
[59:05] brother had talked to me but even some
[59:07] of his children were
[59:10] overwhelmed because they didn't know
[59:13] what their father had done and I thought
[59:16] you know what that is a great man that
[59:19] is a man that does not going around
[59:22] blowing the trumpet but for whatever
[59:24] particular in reason and I feel like
[59:27] that it was a scriptural need that Paul
[59:29] would feel in his heart I would imagine
[59:32] that whenever our brother and his family
[59:35] because it wasn't just him I want you to
[59:37] notice how Paul says this again in 1
[59:39] Corinthians 16:15 I beseech you Brethren
[59:42] you know the house of stephanus I want
[59:45] you to notice that stephanus was not the
[59:48] only one in his household so if he was
[59:52] he would have just mentioned him by name
[59:55] but he says the the house of stephanus
[59:57] that is the first fruits of aop that
[1:00:00] they now stephanus is the only one that
[1:00:03] Paul mentioned his name was it his wife
[1:00:06] his sons his daughters maybe had
[1:00:08] grandchildren we don't know who all they
[1:00:10] were but it was a good group of they and
[1:00:14] it was a good group to hang around now
[1:00:16] maybe God got a hold of stephanus first
[1:00:18] we don't know really the order of
[1:00:20] conversion but it was stephanus and they
[1:00:23] that were in his house so I love it when
[1:00:26] it comes this way that the father is the
[1:00:29] example is the way that it should be and
[1:00:32] sometimes if the father's not worry
[1:00:34] needs to be with the Lord then many
[1:00:36] times a mother will step in and she's
[1:00:38] the one who has to be that but yet if
[1:00:41] they can both be able to come to that
[1:00:43] place where they realize who they are
[1:00:45] then they can begin to influence their
[1:00:48] children and raise their children in
[1:00:50] this way instead of their children being
[1:00:53] raised like the Modern Age lean kids are
[1:00:57] that whatever they want they get it so
[1:01:01] they don't value anything it don't cost
[1:01:04] them anything they want a pair of $150
[1:01:07] tennis shoes well they're going to get
[1:01:08] it they want this they want that they're
[1:01:11] going to get it they know nothing about
[1:01:13] the value of money they know nothing
[1:01:15] about the cost and if you're not careful
[1:01:17] you're raising those kids in that way to
[1:01:21] where they are going to look at
[1:01:23] everything else and if they're not
[1:01:24] careful they transpose that then from
[1:01:27] just life to God so everything God gives
[1:01:30] them God owes this to me God owes me
[1:01:32] this God owes me that brother Donnie
[1:01:34] owes me this the deacons owe me that
[1:01:36] these preachers are called to serve me
[1:01:38] come over here and serve me y'all need
[1:01:40] to bow down to me I'm you know that's
[1:01:43] totally the wrong mindset but this God
[1:01:46] must have laid this on Paul's heart for
[1:01:49] whatever reason there must have been
[1:01:51] something so outstanding about their
[1:01:55] addiction
[1:01:56] now I've dealt with many addicts in my
[1:02:00] Ministry around the world I've dealt
[1:02:02] with many different addicts and
[1:02:04] different types of addicts and I've seen
[1:02:07] those that have been bound by alcohol
[1:02:10] and by drugs and and sometimes by
[1:02:13] smoking maybe and and many of them are
[1:02:15] in this state that they wish they were
[1:02:18] not there they hate it they absolutely
[1:02:21] hate it and people people will tell them
[1:02:24] snap out of it you can do this you can
[1:02:26] overcome it and they try to get them a a
[1:02:29] book on this and a tape on that and this
[1:02:31] psychologist and that psychologist but
[1:02:34] when once that thing gets a hold to you
[1:02:36] many times it takes the spirit of God to
[1:02:38] break that how many times have I seen
[1:02:41] drug addicts that made up their mind
[1:02:43] I'll never do it again but remember your
[1:02:46] body and your brain has become addicted
[1:02:48] to that it will start screaming it will
[1:02:51] scream you ought to see people as I've
[1:02:54] seen them when they're trying to come
[1:02:56] out from under the influence of drugs or
[1:02:59] alcohol and the DT set in and they're
[1:03:02] sweating and they're crying and they're
[1:03:04] agonizing in pain and so on and so on
[1:03:07] why because their body is so addicted to
[1:03:11] that stuff even though they make up
[1:03:13] their mind I don't need it let me go a
[1:03:15] little farther it can happen not only to
[1:03:18] substances it can happen to pornography
[1:03:21] it can happen to all types of things I
[1:03:23] hope you understand the direction I'm
[1:03:25] going to go there are some people that
[1:03:27] have to have a fix of public accolades
[1:03:31] and it's like if they don't get their
[1:03:33] name called and so long and they can't
[1:03:35] do this and can't do that it's like it
[1:03:37] drives them crazy it just it eats on
[1:03:40] them and eats on them and they just
[1:03:42] can't take it so if if nobody won't do
[1:03:45] it voluntarily then they will almost beg
[1:03:48] for it and they will say something on
[1:03:50] YouTube or they will say something on
[1:03:52] Facebook and what they're doing they're
[1:03:54] trying to generate a little bit of
[1:03:56] Praise a little bit of love why they're
[1:03:59] addicted to that and without it they
[1:04:01] they just tore all to pieces they can't
[1:04:03] understand why nobody won't give them
[1:04:05] their fix and then whenever they do it
[1:04:07] somebody will come on there and say well
[1:04:09] brother or sister whoever it is you know
[1:04:11] you're a great so and so and you're this
[1:04:13] and this and this and you know what that
[1:04:15] does that gives them a temporary fix for
[1:04:18] a while and then nobody else will do it
[1:04:21] and they have to do the same thing again
[1:04:23] what a sad life What a Sad life that
[1:04:27] people can become to addicted of things
[1:04:31] that that cuddle oh my and babies
[1:04:34] they're all human nature what in the
[1:04:36] world are we thinking about that we
[1:04:38] think that God wants our human nature to
[1:04:41] be babied anyhow there ought to be
[1:04:44] something inside of us that we are like
[1:04:47] stephanus and his family were that they
[1:04:51] addicted themselves to the ministry of
[1:04:55] the Saints
[1:04:56] now may I say I've been talking about
[1:04:58] the ministry of the son of man and I
[1:05:00] believe that God is going to bring
[1:05:02] according to what the prophet taught us
[1:05:04] the bride of Christ around the world to
[1:05:08] the Perfection as the prophet said it to
[1:05:11] the
[1:05:12] Perfection of the son of man now listen
[1:05:16] to me again the Perfection of the son of
[1:05:20] man that does not mean everyone will
[1:05:23] stand and by discernment call people out
[1:05:25] and tell them what their names are and
[1:05:27] so on that is one to a generation we're
[1:05:30] not called none of us are called to do
[1:05:33] any of that but I do believe every
[1:05:36] member of the body will be so into the
[1:05:39] ministry of Christ Jesus of where God's
[1:05:42] called them to be and let me just tell
[1:05:44] you there's there's Parts about Ministry
[1:05:47] that are glorious there are Parts about
[1:05:49] Ministry that are wonderful but there
[1:05:52] are also Parts about Ministry that are
[1:05:55] burdensome Troublesome heavy and then
[1:05:59] I'm not talking that just about a
[1:06:00] preacher I'm talking about your ministry
[1:06:03] as a child of God oh how pleasant it
[1:06:06] would be if every aspect of our ministry
[1:06:09] now some of you mothers sitting here
[1:06:10] today you may be thinking well brother
[1:06:11] Donnie what in the world is my Minister
[1:06:14] well part of it is being a mom and
[1:06:17] there's fun Parts about being a mom but
[1:06:19] there's troubling Parts about being a
[1:06:22] mom there's Parts about being a mom that
[1:06:25] you don't like being is that right
[1:06:27] mothers you enjoy spanking your kids you
[1:06:30] enjoy chastising them you enjoy it when
[1:06:32] they're wrong and you have to say
[1:06:34] something no that's part of your
[1:06:36] ministry being the Fifth Gospel now the
[1:06:40] household of stephanus they had addicted
[1:06:43] themselves to the ministry of the saints
[1:06:45] that is they were very forward and they
[1:06:48] were very obsessed by the presence of
[1:06:52] God and the desire in them to assist the
[1:06:55] poor Saints now remember looked at this
[1:06:58] in question answers that this thing that
[1:07:00] the apostles did for a little while it
[1:07:02] was a temporary try but it never did
[1:07:04] work to where that they made every
[1:07:07] everybody even and it was not a teaching
[1:07:09] of the Lord Jesus nor a teaching of the
[1:07:11] Apostles but it was something that got
[1:07:13] among the body and they tried to do it
[1:07:15] themselves but it never did work and
[1:07:17] here it is we can see in Corinthians
[1:07:20] here around 59 ad uh that this started
[1:07:23] some 30 years ago 28 years ago something
[1:07:25] like that and it did not work it was a
[1:07:28] form of Communism in other words where
[1:07:30] everything would be communal so all the
[1:07:32] rich would sell everything they have and
[1:07:33] give it to the poor but I want you to
[1:07:35] notice the poor were still there by the
[1:07:38] time first Corinthians was written so
[1:07:40] they saw that now apparently these were
[1:07:42] people of substance and they wanted to
[1:07:45] take the blessing that God had given
[1:07:47] them instead of them living in all this
[1:07:49] upper echelon of life and this upper
[1:07:52] echelon of Lifestyle they wanted to take
[1:07:54] part of what gave them God gave them and
[1:07:57] give it out to others and to be able to
[1:08:00] be a blessing for others so their
[1:08:03] interest in the Lord Jesus somehow it
[1:08:06] was personified that they perceive this
[1:08:09] that the Lord Jesus also had a body now
[1:08:13] you see it's much easier for us to
[1:08:15] isolate this move of God and we all
[1:08:18] Focus all of our attention all of our
[1:08:21] love everything that we are toward this
[1:08:23] lovely Lord Jesus and we love him and we
[1:08:27] serve him and we give him whatever he
[1:08:30] wants but then when it comes to members
[1:08:32] of his body that are flawed members of
[1:08:36] his body which are yet human and they
[1:08:38] have their failures and their
[1:08:39] shortcomings you know come on let's be
[1:08:42] honest now most of us have a hard time
[1:08:45] you know kind of ministering unto them
[1:08:47] oh it's much easier to minister to the
[1:08:49] holy lovely Lord Jesus but that is
[1:08:52] eternal life Jesus Jesus never
[1:08:56] ministered to the perfect there's no
[1:08:58] need for him to come to the Earth cuz he
[1:09:01] wouldn't have found a perfect human
[1:09:02] being on the entire Earth when he was
[1:09:05] here that was not one I don't know
[1:09:07] really what the population of the Earth
[1:09:09] was when the Lord Jesus was here but
[1:09:11] there was not one perfect human being
[1:09:13] that Jesus could go minister to them but
[1:09:16] who needed him the most the sick the
[1:09:19] Lost those that had been married
[1:09:21] multiple times those that were in
[1:09:23] adultery those that were demon yes
[1:09:26] that's the ones that he went
[1:09:27] to NOW Watch What Happens as their
[1:09:31] interest in the Lord Jesus but they were
[1:09:34] living under the influence of the Life
[1:09:37] of Christ now remember as the church
[1:09:39] ages go on this will dwindle down in
[1:09:43] time because as the church becomes
[1:09:45] established and they have buildings and
[1:09:47] property and so on they will tend to
[1:09:49] become more material- minded but the
[1:09:52] influence of that first church age was
[1:09:55] operating under the spirit of Jesus
[1:09:58] himself so that eternal life affected
[1:10:01] this first century Believers and I
[1:10:04] believe with the Restoration in the last
[1:10:06] days there will be a restoration of this
[1:10:09] right here ministering to the body maybe
[1:10:12] some of y'all have never understood me
[1:10:15] in the sense of why I've wanted to build
[1:10:18] churches all over this world maybe
[1:10:20] you've never understood why that I would
[1:10:23] have such a desire to help Prince books
[1:10:25] and bibles and seal books and all kinds
[1:10:28] of things and just so you know without
[1:10:31] going into too much detail through our
[1:10:33] church over the years we have spent
[1:10:35] millions of dollars not thousands
[1:10:38] millions of dollars by helping the bride
[1:10:42] of Christ around the world and I thank
[1:10:45] God we're continuing to do so to this
[1:10:48] day you said why would you even want to
[1:10:50] do that because they are part of who I
[1:10:53] am they are part of who you are now I've
[1:10:56] been privileged to travel to many of
[1:10:57] those places and see where they worship
[1:10:59] and see the things that they have to
[1:11:01] worship God in I know I have an
[1:11:03] advantage over in that way but when I go
[1:11:06] and I see it but remember I was started
[1:11:08] doing this before I ever made one trip
[1:11:11] to Africa one trip to India one trip to
[1:11:14] the third world countries because it was
[1:11:16] something in my heart Carol and I said
[1:11:19] on the front porch of our little single
[1:11:21] wide trailer when we lived down in
[1:11:23] Kentucky back in the 80s and we told God
[1:11:26] sitting on our front porch in a porch
[1:11:28] swing God we sat there and held our
[1:11:30] hands God if we you want us to do
[1:11:32] something for you help us Lord if you
[1:11:34] want us to do this out of the other you
[1:11:36] put it in our hands and we promise we
[1:11:40] make a promise to you God we will help
[1:11:43] your people around the world little did
[1:11:45] we know that we were praying for
[1:11:48] something Way Beyond what we could ever
[1:11:51] imagine in our minds is it something
[1:11:54] that the Bride of Christ does yes it's
[1:11:57] something we should do I want you to
[1:11:59] notice the prophet you're in the
[1:12:00] believer's position in Christ many times
[1:12:03] people go out and see an evangelist like
[1:12:05] for instance our brother Billy Graham
[1:12:07] what good it would do for me to try to
[1:12:09] be like Billy Graham I couldn't do it if
[1:12:11] I had to I've got a Ministry that I've
[1:12:13] got to take care of and the next man's
[1:12:16] got a Ministry and each one has got a
[1:12:19] Ministry even to the housewife on now
[1:12:24] listen here he's talking about himself
[1:12:27] and he's talking about Billy Graham and
[1:12:29] then he brings it on down to even the
[1:12:32] housewife has a minister well I I
[1:12:36] thought Ministry was always preaching
[1:12:38] that's
[1:12:39] tradition that's tradition so the
[1:12:43] housewife has a Ministry well what kind
[1:12:46] of ministry is it how long has it been
[1:12:48] since you seen me get any of our
[1:12:49] housewife sisters up and then preach to
[1:12:51] you on Wednesday night or Sunday
[1:12:53] morning now
[1:12:55] never
[1:12:57] never would that be un unfitting would
[1:13:00] that be contrary to the word it would
[1:13:03] but what if that
[1:13:05] housewife at home in the morning or at
[1:13:08] lunchtime or before her and their kids
[1:13:11] go to bed and the father and that little
[1:13:13] housewife takes her Bible or that little
[1:13:17] housewife takes the books written by an
[1:13:20] Jorgenson and and dramatizes basically
[1:13:23] the prophet's life and they set that and
[1:13:25] they go to discussing the message of the
[1:13:27] hour or they're talking about the things
[1:13:30] Bible stories of Abraham Isaac Jacob and
[1:13:33] so on and that little housewife is there
[1:13:35] with all of her heart trying to instill
[1:13:37] something in her children is she out of
[1:13:40] place then she's out of place if she
[1:13:43] don't do
[1:13:45] it but you see Satan Even in our ranks
[1:13:48] has tried to so uh take away the
[1:13:52] importance of that place and simply give
[1:13:56] our our our kids you know let let them
[1:13:59] watch a Bible video let them nothing
[1:14:01] wrong with that as long as it ain't
[1:14:02] weird but there's nothing wrong with
[1:14:05] that but there's something about hearing
[1:14:07] Mama's voice and Daddy's voice did not
[1:14:10] that begin even with the giving of the
[1:14:12] Old Testament that God said you train
[1:14:15] your children you teach your children
[1:14:17] look look at parents don't think that
[1:14:20] your kids are going to come to church
[1:14:22] twice a week and then even on the Youth
[1:14:24] Services and they're going to get
[1:14:25] everything they need they are fighting
[1:14:28] things I never fought when I was a kid
[1:14:30] they're fighting things you never fought
[1:14:32] when you was a kid they need more help
[1:14:34] than they've ever had in their life I
[1:14:36] appreciate our youth services don't you
[1:14:39] I appreciate our youth leaders Desiring
[1:14:41] to do something for our youth where they
[1:14:43] can come together but remember that does
[1:14:46] not eliminate your responsibility as
[1:14:49] parents mothers God called you and gave
[1:14:53] you a Ministry praise praise the Lord
[1:14:56] God gave you a Ministry notice how he
[1:14:58] words this even to the housewife has a
[1:15:01] Ministry or ministering the word of God
[1:15:06] so you're not just making their eggs or
[1:15:09] their pancakes for their breakfast and
[1:15:10] fixing them a sandwich for lunch and
[1:15:13] you're not just earning their clothes
[1:15:14] and washing their clothes and so on but
[1:15:17] God expect you Sisters You mothers to
[1:15:20] have such an influence on their lives
[1:15:23] and let me not leave the fathers out
[1:15:25] because fathers you also have a great
[1:15:28] responsibility but I find it amazing
[1:15:30] that brother Bram never identifies the
[1:15:33] Fathers as being the sixth gospel on now
[1:15:37] so there's Matthew Mark Luke John and
[1:15:41] mother I'm glad that he didn't say you
[1:15:45] know Carol or Janet or Linda or Barbara
[1:15:49] and give them a name cuz every one the
[1:15:51] rescue sisters if you would name Barbara
[1:15:52] you'd say well that leads me out but he
[1:15:55] did not do it that way he left it under
[1:15:57] the office of mother so father is not
[1:16:01] the Fifth Gospel deacons are not the
[1:16:05] Fifth Gospel Sunday school leaders youth
[1:16:08] leaders are not the Fifth Gospel who is
[1:16:12] Mama right well praise the Lord ah I
[1:16:17] guarantee you right now hell is in an
[1:16:21] uproar and a turmoil hell is tore all
[1:16:25] the pieces all you think my my if
[1:16:28] brother Donnie could get the ministers
[1:16:30] up there and pray for them and get the
[1:16:32] ministers all all filled with the Holy
[1:16:34] Ghost and get them all riled up and get
[1:16:36] the ministers going out and doing this
[1:16:38] and that I want to do that too but I'll
[1:16:40] tell you one thing if we can start in
[1:16:42] the home with Mama then it'll make it a
[1:16:45] lot easier for all the rest of us
[1:16:46] preachers don't just let it stop in Mama
[1:16:49] but let it get a hold to Daddy as well
[1:16:52] now watch this again he says I think
[1:16:54] mother the good true mother is the Fifth
[1:16:58] Gospel Matthew Mark Luke John
[1:17:04] mother can you imagine a prophet of God
[1:17:08] placing
[1:17:10] motherhood right in line not not skip a
[1:17:14] whole big bunch of words but right after
[1:17:18] John mother Matthew Mark Luke John and
[1:17:23] mother why we look at Matthew and Mark
[1:17:26] and luk was said what great men what
[1:17:29] great men and they were but there's not
[1:17:31] a one of them that can take your place
[1:17:34] mother oh my Matthew Mark Luke John
[1:17:38] mother
[1:17:40] mother gets them first yes sir that's
[1:17:45] the one who brings them up first is
[1:17:49] Mother well brother Donnie all my kids
[1:17:52] are gone and I've got grandkids so now
[1:17:54] you're figuring you're at you're at the
[1:17:55] end of it huh carry that same thing
[1:17:58] right over to your grandchildren now
[1:18:00] remember there's a headship and an order
[1:18:02] in the home and of course God does not
[1:18:04] want the grandfather and the grandmother
[1:18:07] to be the head of the home which your
[1:18:08] daughter or son whichever it is is
[1:18:10] founded but our ability to influence our
[1:18:14] lives should never stop that's why Paul
[1:18:18] even went as far to say that the Elder
[1:18:20] women in the church let them teach the
[1:18:22] younger what what they supposed to do
[1:18:23] get a bunch of quotes together and get a
[1:18:25] bunch of scripture together teach them
[1:18:27] by your life sisters there's a way to
[1:18:30] preach the gospel without ever standing
[1:18:33] behind this pull pit what do you do you
[1:18:36] show the young daughters how to love
[1:18:39] their husbands you show the young
[1:18:41] sisters in our church the right kind of
[1:18:44] Godly life don't go around back bashing
[1:18:46] around on them beating around on them
[1:18:49] you see them dressed in a certain way
[1:18:50] that ain't right that's why God calls
[1:18:53] pastors to be able to handle lot of that
[1:18:55] but you'll make enemies and put
[1:18:57] grievance between you and the daughters
[1:19:00] of God at the church when you step out
[1:19:02] of your position God never calls you to
[1:19:06] try to bring correction and say well
[1:19:08] I'll tell you one thing I've seen a
[1:19:10] young girl dress a certain certain thing
[1:19:12] don't you think the Lord is not mindful
[1:19:14] of that and the Lord will lay it on the
[1:19:17] Shepherd's Heart or The Minister's heart
[1:19:20] find your place and stay there and tear
[1:19:24] hell why you're doing it when you get in
[1:19:27] your place oh my you don't have to be
[1:19:30] intimidated because you're not a
[1:19:32] preacher you don't have to feel
[1:19:34] intimidated because you're not an
[1:19:36] evangelist you can know that God called
[1:19:39] you to be a mother it's going to be a
[1:19:41] great reward one of these
[1:19:43] days notice this in the true Easter seal
[1:19:45] he's talking about children here he said
[1:19:48] they Little Treasures that God has given
[1:19:50] you the responsibility of raising and
[1:19:54] I've always said and made this kind of a
[1:19:56] saying to mothers we know written of
[1:19:59] four gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John
[1:20:02] but there's a Fifth
[1:20:05] Gospel can you believe that he would
[1:20:08] place a Godly mother as a
[1:20:12] gospel a gospel what is the gospel good
[1:20:18] news my my notice this Matthew Mark Luke
[1:20:22] and John but there's a fif
[1:20:25] gospel
[1:20:27] Unwritten
[1:20:29] Unwritten that's
[1:20:32] mother so mama don't sit down and say
[1:20:36] this is the generation of Jesus Christ
[1:20:38] when Mary was an espouse to her husband
[1:20:41] Joseph so on and so on that's not what
[1:20:43] mama's going to do mama's going to teach
[1:20:46] her daughters the right kind of Life
[1:20:48] mama ain't going to go around just with
[1:20:50] a measuring tape and measure the length
[1:20:52] of her skirt or do all this and that and
[1:20:54] the other show her mothers show your
[1:20:57] daughter why that it's good to dress
[1:21:00] Godly and be moral show her thy life and
[1:21:03] show her these girls and these women out
[1:21:06] here after they do come to God and many
[1:21:08] of them do and see how that Mark upon
[1:21:11] them that they got as a teenager haunts
[1:21:14] them their entire life and they still
[1:21:17] deal with that because of what they did
[1:21:19] show them the way a gospel preacher does
[1:21:23] a preacher that stands up and beats and
[1:21:25] beats and whips and beats on people all
[1:21:28] the time oh my goodness I have a hard
[1:21:30] time sitting under a man like that
[1:21:32] myself sure whoop me when I need it but
[1:21:34] after you get done whooping on me give
[1:21:36] me a little bit of oil and wine in my
[1:21:38] wounds and tell me what I can do sure
[1:21:42] lay it on me man hit me up one side and
[1:21:44] down the other but when you get done
[1:21:46] doing it don't leave me in condemnation
[1:21:49] don't leave me in a bad State pray with
[1:21:51] me lead me back into the presence of
[1:21:56] God oh my there's a Fifth Gospel
[1:22:01] Unwritten that's
[1:22:06] mother she gets them before Matthew Mark
[1:22:13] Luke and John's teaching gets
[1:22:17] them don't you see
[1:22:19] Mama gets that baby before Matthew does
[1:22:24] mama
[1:22:25] gets Mama gets that baby before Mark
[1:22:29] does it can't read Matthew it can't read
[1:22:33] mark it can't read Luke it can't read
[1:22:36] John but mama had it when she was
[1:22:39] carrying it in her
[1:22:42] womb she heard its voice her voice
[1:22:46] rather and whenever that baby is born it
[1:22:49] don't take it long to know who mama is
[1:22:53] because God gave it an affinity between
[1:22:56] thy child and that mother can't you see
[1:23:00] why Satan purposed it so many years ago
[1:23:03] to destroy the backbone of our
[1:23:07] nation come on children the backbone of
[1:23:11] our nation is not
[1:23:13] pastors it is not evangelists it is not
[1:23:16] songwriters or singers the backbone of
[1:23:20] our nation is Womanhood and motherhood
[1:23:24] don't you see why Satan wants to do so
[1:23:27] many of his things in this day are aimed
[1:23:31] at women and girls oh my get them out of
[1:23:34] their place get them out of where God
[1:23:36] wants them to be let a television raise
[1:23:39] their young ons if they believe in young
[1:23:41] ons and they get to a place they don't
[1:23:43] even want no young ons no more they want
[1:23:45] to kill them and every one of them are
[1:23:47] going to stand before God at the day of
[1:23:49] judgment I wish somebody would say Amen
[1:23:51] if you believe it but you realize it
[1:23:54] ain't no wonder that Satan wanted to do
[1:23:57] it that way if he can break it out
[1:23:59] yonder but let's not stop out there what
[1:24:02] if he can break it inside the ranks of
[1:24:04] our message and our sisters are no
[1:24:06] longer willing to show your daughters
[1:24:09] and your sons oh the importance of
[1:24:13] having a godly woman in your life oh you
[1:24:15] say well brother Donnie that's just for
[1:24:17] the girls it ain't for the girls I will
[1:24:20] tell many of the young sisters in our
[1:24:21] church when they're interested in a
[1:24:23] young man especially if he's going to
[1:24:25] another church and they're not really
[1:24:27] familiar with him I'll tell them and
[1:24:29] give them this advice you watch how that
[1:24:31] young man treats his mother you watch
[1:24:34] how that young man will treat his
[1:24:36] sisters and the females that are around
[1:24:39] him and that may give you a pretty good
[1:24:42] idea of how he will treat you because
[1:24:45] God made the home come on somebody God
[1:24:48] never made a child to be raised by two
[1:24:51] fathers whoever heard of such Tommy R
[1:24:53] out of hell God never meant for two
[1:24:56] women to get married and try to bring a
[1:24:59] baby well go ahead and bring one if you
[1:25:01] two women getting together can bring a
[1:25:03] baby I dare you do it I dare you men who
[1:25:06] want to marry a man go ahead and bring a
[1:25:09] baby but what do you do you'll adopt one
[1:25:11] and you'll pervert that child don't you
[1:25:14] understand why this transgender move and
[1:25:17] this thing is going to change an entire
[1:25:20] generation a generation of young people
[1:25:23] are being changed
[1:25:25] towards sodomites why because they're
[1:25:28] raising them as kids and they pervert
[1:25:31] they're thinking they look at two
[1:25:33] daddies they look at two mommies they
[1:25:35] see two women kissing two men kissing oh
[1:25:39] come on don't sit there and look at me
[1:25:41] and what does it do it warps that little
[1:25:44] child sinking so mama was a lesbian Mama
[1:25:47] one and Mama two was a lesbian what do
[1:25:51] you think that child is going to be but
[1:25:53] the Bible says train a child up in the
[1:25:57] way that it should go and when it gets
[1:26:00] old it will not depart from it let's
[1:26:04] raise our kids according to God's
[1:26:07] [Applause]
[1:26:15] word oh my
[1:26:17] goodness well that wasn't part of the
[1:26:20] sermon but it is now
[1:26:24] but there's a fa a Fifth Gospel
[1:26:26] Unwritten that's mother she gets them
[1:26:29] before Matthew Mark Luke and John's
[1:26:34] teaching gets them so the
[1:26:37] responsibilities is placed upon you
[1:26:40] mothers and fathers to raise these
[1:26:43] children for the kingdom of God yes sir
[1:26:46] and God don't want none of us to raise
[1:26:48] our kids up to be spoiled rotten selfish
[1:26:52] brats amen
[1:26:57] boy it seems warm in here to me is it
[1:26:59] just me
[1:27:02] or you understand God will hold you
[1:27:05] responsible for raising
[1:27:08] brats that are self-centered and
[1:27:11] selfish it'll take a pastor years and
[1:27:13] years to get that out of them if he ever
[1:27:19] does
[1:27:20] wo y'all say me Monday standing on the
[1:27:23] side of the road down there interchange
[1:27:24] off of Rome Street and Y 26 we work for
[1:27:27] food can't put preach cuz I know better
[1:27:30] than
[1:27:32] that to raise these children he says for
[1:27:36] the kingdom of God I'm sure that's your
[1:27:39] heart's desire I believe as much as I
[1:27:41] believe that quote there are mother
[1:27:43] sitting here today that is your heart's
[1:27:45] desire some of you your children's
[1:27:48] already raised and gone well say brother
[1:27:50] Donnie they're too old I can't do
[1:27:52] nothing don't you never believe that
[1:27:54] you've still got knees ain't you You'
[1:27:56] still got words right hear in this mouth
[1:27:58] you can pray amen come on somebody well
[1:28:02] they're out there in the world that may
[1:28:04] be so but the power of a mother's prayer
[1:28:07] and a Father's prayer is more powerful
[1:28:10] hallelujah it's more powerful than drugs
[1:28:13] it's more powerful than alcohol prayer
[1:28:17] is the most powerful weapon that God
[1:28:20] ever put into the hands of human beings
[1:28:27] oh
[1:28:28] my so you see every
[1:28:31] Christian that comes to the Lord
[1:28:34] Jesus has a Ministry yes
[1:28:38] sir every one of you men women
[1:28:43] boys
[1:28:47] girls don't raise your hands but I
[1:28:50] wonder how many of you even know yours
[1:28:56] because you think Ministry Ministry oh
[1:28:58] that's brother Daryl and that's brother
[1:28:59] John brother Joel Brown brother johnon
[1:29:02] brother Michael brother Jo you know
[1:29:04] brother Donnie I me that that that's
[1:29:05] that's Ministry
[1:29:07] no that's part of the
[1:29:10] ministry but you have one
[1:29:16] too each one of us has a different
[1:29:19] Ministry each one works different each
[1:29:21] one of you has a Ministry a separate
[1:29:24] Ministry
[1:29:26] all say that word with me
[1:29:30] all that comes
[1:29:33] into
[1:29:36] Christ now here's the
[1:29:39] key if you're not into him and you're
[1:29:42] just a church member then you don't have
[1:29:46] one but if you are baptized into the
[1:29:50] body you have a Ministry
[1:29:55] you say how is that so well look at your
[1:29:58] body your kidneys don't you appreciate
[1:30:02] them you ever thank God for your kidneys
[1:30:04] most of you don't you don't even think
[1:30:05] about them unless they're hurting or you
[1:30:07] get a kidney stone then you love them oh
[1:30:10] you pray for him you pray for
[1:30:12] him what about other parts of your body
[1:30:15] it has a Ministry yes sir most of the
[1:30:18] time we don't think that much about it
[1:30:20] as long as it's working well until the
[1:30:22] doctor says your bow duct is stopped up
[1:30:25] this is going on that's going on oh oh
[1:30:28] no oh what am I going to do well can I
[1:30:30] live without this certain certain thing
[1:30:31] no you can't live without it if it don't
[1:30:33] get better you're going to die oh my my
[1:30:36] that little thing that you've never even
[1:30:37] laid your eyes on becomes so important
[1:30:41] and so
[1:30:43] vital I guess that's one thing that
[1:30:46] among many that I don't like about a big
[1:30:51] church now some of y'all I've heard of
[1:30:54] over the years well I I'd love to go
[1:30:55] there I already like brother Don's
[1:30:56] Ministry and this that and the other but
[1:30:58] I don't like a big church neither do
[1:31:03] I but I ain't like some of you I want to
[1:31:07] please him so I can't pick a small
[1:31:10] Church to go to because I prefer it
[1:31:13] humanly if it' been left up to me I
[1:31:16] would have never left Kentucky 120
[1:31:19] people or so something like that oh yeah
[1:31:22] I'd much rather been there no nobody
[1:31:24] knew me everybody left me alone nobody
[1:31:26] threatened to kill me and all that sort
[1:31:28] of thing I I I I would have still been
[1:31:31] happy right there if it's left up to me
[1:31:33] but you see my life is not my own so I
[1:31:37] can't tell the Lord now look Lord I'm
[1:31:39] going over there because it's a small
[1:31:42] Church small Church small problems
[1:31:45] bigger Church bigger problems bigger
[1:31:47] than that church bigger problem big
[1:31:49] church
[1:31:51] big problems
[1:31:54] and I don't like problems okay I wish
[1:31:57] every Christian here was a Whirlpool
[1:32:06] Christian but even they're made Chine
[1:32:08] anymore so even that name don't mean
[1:32:10] nothing but most of the Christians that
[1:32:13] I've pastured are not Whirlpool some of
[1:32:16] them want to throw me in the whirl pool
[1:32:19] and push the button and try to ring me
[1:32:22] out
[1:32:24] but you see the way I look at it God has
[1:32:27] a need for preachers that can pasture
[1:32:31] his troubled
[1:32:33] children I tell brother Tim PR and
[1:32:35] brother Ron Spencer all the time they're
[1:32:37] my buddies so I tell them all the time
[1:32:39] it looks like to me that y'all got all
[1:32:41] the perfect people to your church all
[1:32:43] the Flawless all the wonderful
[1:32:46] magnanimous tendous tremendous all these
[1:32:50] great adjectives that I can come up and
[1:32:51] and they're moving to your church and I
[1:32:53] get stuck with the
[1:32:56] rest I told brother Mark Spencer brother
[1:32:58] Ron's brother the other day I said buddy
[1:33:00] it looks like to me that brother Tim and
[1:33:02] brother Ron got all them delicious
[1:33:04] Saints they got all them high profile
[1:33:07] glory to God Mountaintop Christian and
[1:33:10] me and you must have got the scrap and
[1:33:12] the leftovers he said I'm hearing you
[1:33:14] brother but you know what God's got to
[1:33:16] have somebody but I'm going to tell you
[1:33:18] all and just s is between me and you all
[1:33:20] okay everybody brother Tim's Church
[1:33:22] ain't perfect and nether NE is he cuz I
[1:33:24] know him everybody in brother Ron's
[1:33:26] Church ain't perfect and neither is he
[1:33:28] cuz I know him there ain't no perfect
[1:33:31] preachers there ain't no perfect
[1:33:33] churches every one of them are flawed
[1:33:36] from the pull pit to the back every
[1:33:39] person that streams us is flawed and we
[1:33:42] all need help and God knew that about us
[1:33:47] he knew I would let him down he knew I
[1:33:50] would fail him and he saved me
[1:33:58] anyway I don't mind telling you if I
[1:34:00] would have known the way some of my
[1:34:04] friends would have treated me over the
[1:34:06] years I would have never let him be my
[1:34:09] friend in the first place cuz when you
[1:34:11] weigh it all out what you got out of
[1:34:13] them didn't weigh up near as much as the
[1:34:16] pain they inflicted on you but unlike
[1:34:19] the Lord Jesus he knew all my faults and
[1:34:21] my failures and my mistakes and how many
[1:34:24] times I would fall short of his glory
[1:34:27] and he said I love you anyway I'm going
[1:34:29] to save you anyway I'm going to call you
[1:34:32] to preach anyway you're going to mess up
[1:34:34] some of your words are going to come out
[1:34:35] sideways and some of them's going to
[1:34:37] come out upside down and it'll take the
[1:34:39] Holy Ghost if anybody ever gets anything
[1:34:41] out of your preaching but I'm going to
[1:34:42] go ahead and call you to preach I'm
[1:34:44] going to go ahead and save you I'm going
[1:34:46] to fill you with the Holy Ghost well
[1:34:47] aren't you glad he looked at you the
[1:34:49] same way I see your false I see your
[1:34:52] issues I see your trouble but I'm going
[1:34:54] to get you there I'm going to prove to
[1:34:56] the devil I am greater than your faults
[1:35:00] I am greater than your mistakes I am
[1:35:03] greater than your shortcoming I will
[1:35:06] prove it because I'm
[1:35:08] [Applause]
[1:35:18] God oh
[1:35:20] my all that comes into Christ has a
[1:35:23] Ministry that's
[1:35:24] right not only the
[1:35:28] preacher but you have a Ministry to
[1:35:31] something something you can
[1:35:35] do I hope this don't sound sacriligious
[1:35:37] but usually
[1:35:39] God has to drive
[1:35:41] you into your correct
[1:35:44] Ministry some Methodist Brethren the
[1:35:46] other day received the Holy Ghost and
[1:35:48] Farmers up in Indiana and all they was
[1:35:50] just all of fire and they said I've been
[1:35:53] reading a book said brother brandom
[1:35:55] shall we come together now and
[1:35:58] seek for our ministry I said
[1:36:02] no you'll run yourself doing
[1:36:06] that I said you don't do that I said a
[1:36:10] man that's always seeking for God to do
[1:36:13] something search and such and such a
[1:36:15] thing usually don't Mount to very
[1:36:20] much it's the man that doesn't want to
[1:36:23] do
[1:36:24] it that's the one that God can
[1:36:28] use it's amazing many young men have
[1:36:32] come to me over the years and thinking
[1:36:33] maybe they were called to
[1:36:35] preach and I always get amazed at it
[1:36:37] because some of the ones who come to me
[1:36:39] already had 12 or 15 sermons lined out
[1:36:42] and they just want to talk about me talk
[1:36:44] to me whether they even called or
[1:36:47] not and for some of them you can forget
[1:36:49] talking them out of it cuz they're
[1:36:52] already in the ministry and in their
[1:36:54] mind and what do they mount to
[1:36:58] nothing one of the biggest traps Satan
[1:37:00] can lay on a man is to convince him that
[1:37:03] he's called to preach or called to be a
[1:37:05] certain aspect of the ministry and yet
[1:37:07] never amounts to anything only hinders
[1:37:11] the work of
[1:37:13] God well come on now children you not
[1:37:16] believe some of the things that I asked
[1:37:19] and I ask every one of them the same
[1:37:20] thing tell me how God called you well
[1:37:23] well brother Donnie I I was reading a
[1:37:25] scripture on Sunday morning and I come
[1:37:27] to church and you read from that same
[1:37:29] scripture I said brother that happens to
[1:37:32] my wife does that mean she's called to
[1:37:33] preach
[1:37:35] too well I was out the other day and I
[1:37:38] saw this Bumblebee and I I said brother
[1:37:40] look a call is exactly that the Lord
[1:37:44] Jesus called Peter personally he called
[1:37:47] Luke personally he called Paul
[1:37:48] personally what did God tell you when he
[1:37:52] called you your call is the Foundation
[1:37:54] well God didn't exactly I mean it was
[1:37:57] just like that I I just felt impressed I
[1:37:59] I just
[1:38:02] felt now I want you to notice how he
[1:38:04] does this now this doesn't just apply to
[1:38:06] preachers this applies to all of us and
[1:38:09] finding our
[1:38:11] position it's a man that doesn't want to
[1:38:14] do it that's the one God can use look at
[1:38:16] Moses and Paul different ones running
[1:38:18] from it trying to get away from it you
[1:38:21] take a fell that's always Lord I'll do
[1:38:24] this if you'll do this and things like
[1:38:25] that God knows he'd be a stuffed shirt
[1:38:32] anyhow so it just takes somebody who
[1:38:34] don't want to do it now to me this is so
[1:38:37] sad it's heartbreaking
[1:38:40] actually he takes somebody who don't
[1:38:43] want to do it and say maybe I can use
[1:38:47] him a little while till he
[1:38:50] gets to be one
[1:38:54] so even in some of the preachers that
[1:38:56] God will use God you uses them on this
[1:38:59] option right here I'll go ahead and use
[1:39:02] him for a
[1:39:03] while until he becomes a stuffed
[1:39:06] shirt thinking he's so great and he's so
[1:39:08] big and he don't need my leadership no
[1:39:10] more or he don't check what he's feeling
[1:39:14] led to do by the word and so on you
[1:39:17] understand Lord have mercy maybe I can
[1:39:20] use him I'm reminded the question answer
[1:39:22] in 195 n that he said God has a hard
[1:39:25] time trying to find a man that he can
[1:39:30] use cuz he said with many the more he
[1:39:33] uses them the bigger they get the more
[1:39:36] he uses them the bigger they
[1:39:38] get I don't think I'll ever forget when
[1:39:41] I quoted that 30 some years ago in Happy
[1:39:44] Valley brother Johnson was standing back
[1:39:47] down with his hand many of you remember
[1:39:48] many you young people didn't ever even
[1:39:50] meet him our brother lost his sight he
[1:39:53] was standing there with his hands on the
[1:39:55] back of the chair always love the word
[1:39:58] always into the word and whenever I
[1:39:59] quoted that
[1:40:00] quote then brother abam turned around
[1:40:02] and said if God can find a person that
[1:40:05] the more he uses them the little they
[1:40:08] get so brother Johnson was standing with
[1:40:10] his hands on the back of the Pew like
[1:40:12] this and he
[1:40:14] went and the quote goes on to say the
[1:40:16] more he uses him the ler by the time I
[1:40:19] got done P guys in on the
[1:40:21] floor now if you know why that quote
[1:40:26] meant so much to him he was acting out
[1:40:31] what he heard I'll tell you children my
[1:40:34] preaching is worthless if you don't act
[1:40:36] out what you're hearing I ain't talking
[1:40:39] about being a bunch of put on now I'm
[1:40:41] talking about making that your life and
[1:40:43] your actions every day are what you are
[1:40:46] hearing are we ready to go he's ready to
[1:40:50] come oh my can I have a few more minutes
[1:40:53] he says I'll try to get away from it one
[1:40:56] time great
[1:40:58] Ministries has always been somebody
[1:41:01] trying to get away from
[1:41:03] it not one who's always CA God let him
[1:41:07] do something for them and then they're
[1:41:09] all puffed out big and how great and
[1:41:13] everything but a man that doesn't want
[1:41:16] to do it he's
[1:41:21] forced you know why we got this new
[1:41:24] place out
[1:41:26] here I didn't want to do
[1:41:29] it I don't like
[1:41:31] change we lived in our house about 16 17
[1:41:35] years Carol something like that the
[1:41:37] walls were the same color they were when
[1:41:39] we built
[1:41:40] it and still would be but I'm married to
[1:41:44] a woman God bless her heart that loves
[1:41:49] change and she's married to a man that
[1:41:52] don't like
[1:41:54] change so it takes grace and mercy and
[1:41:59] understanding to work between change and
[1:42:01] no change Brother Gary Harris taking his
[1:42:04] hand and doing this over to Sister Lona
[1:42:06] this morning you're in hot water now
[1:42:10] buddy I made all kinds of
[1:42:13] excuses but I am so glad that I finally
[1:42:16] you know one thing I did I listened to
[1:42:19] brother Jim bab and his things at the
[1:42:21] church I got the deacons together and
[1:42:23] asked the Deacon brother brothers tell
[1:42:24] me why do you think we need that and
[1:42:26] others I got together why do we need it
[1:42:28] and once I did that I realized the need
[1:42:31] was there so what do I do the fear of
[1:42:34] doing it do I let that control me oh but
[1:42:36] Lord what if we do most every time you
[1:42:39] go to build a new church it'll always
[1:42:41] cause the church
[1:42:43] split it's amazing there will be people
[1:42:46] that will leave because you build one
[1:42:48] and there'll be more people that'll come
[1:42:49] in because you built one and I'm
[1:42:52] thinking don't make no sense at all what
[1:42:54] in the world does that even do so I ask
[1:42:57] you was it the right decision look at
[1:43:01] what God has done look at the meetings
[1:43:03] that we've been allowed to have look at
[1:43:06] the youth services the special meetings
[1:43:08] so on and so on aren't you glad I didn't
[1:43:12] listen to me aren't you glad I didn't go
[1:43:15] what Donnie wanted to do what it's the
[1:43:18] same with you in your ministry that you
[1:43:21] will have to make decisions for for the
[1:43:23] betterment of your children when you
[1:43:26] yourself may not even want to do it I
[1:43:28] can tell you of a certain Pastor a man
[1:43:30] that was called to a certain area and
[1:43:31] they' been preaching there for quite
[1:43:33] some time he contacted me several times
[1:43:35] actually came here and talked to me also
[1:43:36] on the phone as well and he said Brother
[1:43:38] Don just in a real dilemma I know you've
[1:43:40] been in that state before he said help
[1:43:42] me guide me help me so I talked to him
[1:43:44] well the brother had almost convinced he
[1:43:47] was going to take this church at this
[1:43:48] certain certain place about a situation
[1:43:51] come up in his family had children at
[1:43:53] home and because of that situation he
[1:43:56] did not feel that it was the right thing
[1:43:59] to do you think wow what a man that
[1:44:02] would acknowledge now it was a church it
[1:44:04] was a good-sized church and he would
[1:44:06] have been one of the one of the great M
[1:44:09] of great gifted brother but he looked at
[1:44:11] his family and he looked at his need you
[1:44:14] see sometimes it ain't all about us as
[1:44:17] parents it ain't all about everything
[1:44:20] working around us come on somebody and
[1:44:22] preach with with me sometimes many times
[1:44:25] we'll have to do things that will be
[1:44:28] difficult don't you think it's hard on
[1:44:29] me as your Shepherd to have to bend you
[1:44:32] over my knee spiritually and wear you
[1:44:34] out it breaks my heart every time I have
[1:44:37] to but I'll tell you what I keep before
[1:44:40] me what I keep before me is me standing
[1:44:43] before the Lord and you all standing
[1:44:45] there behind me and you come running and
[1:44:48] screaming our precious brother thank you
[1:44:52] thank you thank you for telling the
[1:44:54] truth that's what I keep before me and
[1:44:57] that's why I say it hurts them it hurts
[1:45:00] me but it will be worth at all after a
[1:45:11] while but you see many pastors do the
[1:45:14] same thing that many parents
[1:45:16] do well I don't want to say nothing to
[1:45:19] them I don't want to drive them from the
[1:45:22] Lord
[1:45:23] so I'm going to let them do whatever
[1:45:25] they want to do you know they're living
[1:45:27] in my house and everything and I mean if
[1:45:29] they don't want to live right I just
[1:45:31] whatever they want to do and they want
[1:45:33] to behave and I don't want to drive them
[1:45:35] from the
[1:45:37] Lord and pastors are do the same thing
[1:45:40] well we're trying to win
[1:45:43] people so we win them by compromising
[1:45:45] our
[1:45:46] standards so we don't preach on hair no
[1:45:48] more we don't preach on dress no more we
[1:45:50] don't certainly don't mention any social
[1:45:52] things that are get you in hot water cuz
[1:45:54] it ain't just me this who whose face is
[1:45:56] fled on YouTube but you all too so I
[1:45:59] realize that and it's painful for you to
[1:46:01] do it but first of all I have to lay
[1:46:03] down at
[1:46:05] night and if I
[1:46:08] compromise I could not stand
[1:46:13] myself I could not live with
[1:46:17] myself and I have to answer to him I
[1:46:21] want to meet him in peace
[1:46:23] not in
[1:46:24] war parents you're going to have to
[1:46:27] stand before
[1:46:29] him oh
[1:46:31] my notice this oh he says Jehovah jarra
[1:46:37] each one of us has a work to do each one
[1:46:41] of us has a
[1:46:44] Ministry and the
[1:46:46] peculiarity of it and so forth it's it's
[1:46:49] together to glorify God you see friends
[1:46:52] this is why this move around the
[1:46:55] message of no need of going to church
[1:46:57] and no need of we know many people would
[1:47:00] love to come but they can't it's where
[1:47:02] they live I ain't talking about them
[1:47:04] people I'm talking about those that make
[1:47:07] fun of going to church and make fun of
[1:47:14] pastors can't you see how
[1:47:17] Antichrist in theory that is because
[1:47:21] they think they don't need any
[1:47:23] body and nobody needs
[1:47:27] them I can be just as good a Christian
[1:47:30] as staying at home according to the very
[1:47:32] Prophet you say you believe he said the
[1:47:35] exact opposite cuz he said those words
[1:47:39] people say well I can be just as good a
[1:47:41] Christian staying home he said you
[1:47:48] cannot let me hurry we'll get down here
[1:47:51] and I'll I'll close I didn't realize
[1:47:53] this is going to take so long sir I just
[1:47:55] thought I was going to deal with this
[1:47:56] part a little bit and get over to the
[1:47:57] good part well I shouldn't say that this
[1:47:59] is
[1:48:01] good church ageb that's why no man can
[1:48:04] ever come along and say the holy man is
[1:48:06] a pope or the holy man is a bishop or a
[1:48:10] priest the holy man is Christ the holy
[1:48:13] spirit in us how
[1:48:16] dare the hierarchy declar the
[1:48:19] leoty has no word to say wow
[1:48:23] each
[1:48:24] one has something to say each has a
[1:48:30] work each has a
[1:48:34] Ministry the Holy Ghost came at
[1:48:36] Pentecost and separated himself on each
[1:48:40] that it might be fulfilled where of
[1:48:43] Christ said at that day you shall know
[1:48:44] that I am in my father and ye in me and
[1:48:49] I in you
[1:48:56] brother Donnie when will my Ministry
[1:48:58] cease when you
[1:49:01] do when you do look at brother Benton I
[1:49:04] don't know how long it's been since our
[1:49:05] brother has been physically able to
[1:49:08] preach a
[1:49:10] sermon and the way his situation come
[1:49:14] upon him he been having a meeting and
[1:49:16] then he gets sick and then it's like it
[1:49:18] leads into the state to where he's at
[1:49:20] today but what a strength it is is to me
[1:49:24] for him coming there don't you think
[1:49:25] it'd be easier for him to set it
[1:49:27] home some of y'all think you got aches
[1:49:30] and pains you imagine how much our
[1:49:32] brother has dealt with the thousands and
[1:49:35] maybe even millions of miles that he's
[1:49:37] traveled around the world and and go up
[1:49:39] into places in the jungles where the
[1:49:42] bigname preachers wouldn't go oh my just
[1:49:45] him being here ministers to me what
[1:49:48] about anybody else is brother Benton a
[1:49:51] blessing to you
[1:49:59] the family that's here with us visting
[1:50:00] from Texas and we was talking to them
[1:50:03] the other day and they talking about how
[1:50:04] they've been streaming the services here
[1:50:06] for several years and they said they
[1:50:07] felt like they knew the people and they
[1:50:09] started calling certain people's names
[1:50:11] and they said that people didn't realize
[1:50:14] what that individual meant to them just
[1:50:16] one it was their worship and another it
[1:50:18] was their sincerity and how it minister
[1:50:21] of course they didn't know what I was
[1:50:22] studying on here but you realize it's
[1:50:25] not just what you're up and doing and
[1:50:27] what you're saying it's the way you
[1:50:28] worship it's the way you press through
[1:50:32] it's the sincerity that you have when
[1:50:34] you pray the way you raise your hand so
[1:50:37] much about us can minister to others how
[1:50:42] many is so blessed by Brother Harry's
[1:50:43] singing and his
[1:50:48] music how many's blessed by brother
[1:50:51] Larry
[1:50:55] brother lar pays gives so much time to
[1:50:58] preparing for the special
[1:51:00] songs he gives so much time many times
[1:51:04] by
[1:51:05] himself rest of the brothers work
[1:51:07] schedule won't allow them to be here and
[1:51:10] he give it up why so the singing can be
[1:51:13] as good as
[1:51:15] possible and they can have the right key
[1:51:18] they can know where to sing how to even
[1:51:20] sometimes I'll tell them if if they need
[1:51:22] to come up here and be reverent but even
[1:51:24] come in here to the church or they can
[1:51:25] be able to adjust the volume so we can
[1:51:28] minimize mistakes I don't know about you
[1:51:30] this is my life I don't want to give
[1:51:33] Jesus you know just just a high
[1:51:35] something or another I want to give him
[1:51:37] my very best I study and study and study
[1:51:41] and study brother Daryl's told me many
[1:51:43] times when we're out together out
[1:51:45] preaching together hunting together and
[1:51:46] might come into a place I was at in
[1:51:48] Illinois a few years ago he and I were
[1:51:49] there together I had a computer in my
[1:51:51] lap I had an iPad laying on this side
[1:51:54] and another iPad laying there and
[1:51:55] another another computer laying over
[1:51:57] here he walked in just shook his head
[1:51:59] said brother Donnie if I studied that
[1:52:01] much it drive me crazy but you know what
[1:52:03] every one of us have to give God our
[1:52:06] very best that's the way I'm made I get
[1:52:09] up I want to give the Holy Ghost so much
[1:52:12] to use it'll come out of me like a
[1:52:14] Gatling gun when the anointing falls on
[1:52:16] my memory falls on my recall I don't
[1:52:19] want it to be well the Cardinals beat
[1:52:21] the the Packers and the Packers beat the
[1:52:23] bleeders and the bleeders beat the boers
[1:52:25] and who whoever all that nonsense is I
[1:52:28] don't want all them sports stats in my
[1:52:30] head I want the prophet said this and
[1:52:32] Paul said that and Jeremiah said that
[1:52:35] that's why I don't feed on a bunch of
[1:52:36] this nonsense so when I get up I can
[1:52:39] speak the word speak the scripture speak
[1:52:42] the message oh children that ain't just
[1:52:44] good for a preacher each one of us need
[1:52:47] to say God help
[1:52:49] me in my Ministry
[1:52:52] [Music]
[1:52:55] let me wind it down with this you young
[1:52:58] people
[1:53:00] realize some of you have influence on
[1:53:02] others at our
[1:53:04] church some of you young
[1:53:06] men have influence on some of the other
[1:53:09] young
[1:53:10] men do you realize if you start leaning
[1:53:13] a certain way or wearing a certain type
[1:53:15] of clothes or a certain thing or getting
[1:53:17] a certain type of attitude or listening
[1:53:19] to a certain type of music
[1:53:23] or I'm just doing that cuz I want to oh
[1:53:25] no it's not just you you see what if you
[1:53:29] affect one more young man or two more
[1:53:31] young men or three more young men in our
[1:53:34] church and then they start acting like
[1:53:38] you do you understand that almighty God
[1:53:41] is going to hold you responsible for
[1:53:43] that influence same with the young
[1:53:44] sisters yes
[1:53:46] sir so if a young man or a young woman
[1:53:48] gets to church and I'll watch them in
[1:53:51] church I I can tell a lot by watching
[1:53:53] them in church where they are in their
[1:53:55] walk with God they're sitting there and
[1:53:58] sniggering and hitting one another and
[1:53:59] laughing and talking and don't pay no
[1:54:02] attention don't say Amen to the word I
[1:54:04] know they're in a backsliding
[1:54:07] state you don't impress me by how much
[1:54:09] you jump and shout and scream and holler
[1:54:12] what get God's attention is you keep his
[1:54:15] word and part of keeping his word is
[1:54:18] Amen in his word so one sister in our
[1:54:21] church
[1:54:23] and we've got them they're leaders
[1:54:24] they're sisters that have influence
[1:54:26] above other sisters and brothers that do
[1:54:28] the same don't ever
[1:54:31] think well this is just me it ain't got
[1:54:33] nothing to do with nobody that's not the
[1:54:35] way a body
[1:54:38] works so a cancer cell gets in one part
[1:54:41] of your
[1:54:42] body you think it's going to stay there
[1:54:45] what is that what's that devil want to
[1:54:47] do
[1:54:50] Spread spread amen and many of them are
[1:54:53] totally painless and almost
[1:54:57] symptomless until the person is nearly
[1:55:01] dead then when they go they've got pains
[1:55:04] they've got this at and the other and it
[1:55:05] shows up on the scan we hate to tell you
[1:55:08] you're eat
[1:55:09] up how can that be I I've never even had
[1:55:13] any any pain any
[1:55:15] issues why because the body is
[1:55:19] ministered
[1:55:21] to so God made the body to be able to
[1:55:24] catch these things yes
[1:55:27] MH so the LMP nodes the LMP
[1:55:31] glands things pass through it and it's
[1:55:34] meant to catch it there but sometimes it
[1:55:36] just overwhelms it and it passes right
[1:55:39] on through into the main trunk of the
[1:55:42] body or coming up this way and going out
[1:55:46] what is it it's like the spiritual body
[1:55:49] of
[1:55:50] Christ don't think that being nosy and
[1:55:53] trying to run your life don't think that
[1:55:54] others that see you aren't concerned
[1:55:57] about you and they see you're not
[1:55:58] sitting where you used to sit and you're
[1:56:01] not singing the way you used to sing and
[1:56:03] you don't clap your hands no

[1:59:31] that God when you hear the prayer
[1:59:33] request turned in and this one's sick
[1:59:35] and that one's sick and something just
[1:59:38] touches your
[1:59:40] heart to send them a
[1:59:44] card and you think wow that ain't much
[1:59:47] huh it may not be much to
[1:59:49] you but to those who receive it
[1:59:54] it the Lord years and years ago put that
[1:59:57] on Carol's heart Carol don't feel like
[1:59:59] she has much of a
[2:00:01] Ministry she doesn't feel like she does
[2:00:04] very
[2:00:05] much she tells me all this
[2:00:08] time I want to be standing there with
[2:00:10] you whenever you walk up before the Lord
[2:00:14] and I know I won't have no reward I said
[2:00:18] Carol the prophet tells us with every
[2:00:20] man that stands there the a good woman
[2:00:22] standing behind him I would not be what
[2:00:25] I am today if it was not for that woman
[2:00:28] that God placed with
[2:00:30] me and the church
[2:00:33] said she not just a pastor's wife she's
[2:00:37] a Godly pastor's wife she listens to
[2:00:41] tapes she reads her Bible she
[2:00:44] prays she's always been that way and
[2:00:47] remember that was the woman that never
[2:00:49] even heard the story of David and
[2:00:52] Goliath and Jonah and the whale till
[2:00:56] after she got saved at the age of
[2:01:00] 16 she was not brought up in a
[2:01:03] Bible loving family or home or a
[2:01:07] churchgoing
[2:01:09] home some of you kids heard these
[2:01:11] stories when you two and three years old
[2:01:14] but Carol never heard
[2:01:17] them I told you she shared it with our
[2:01:19] youth here few weeks back
[2:01:22] you ought to seen the looks on some of
[2:01:24] our faces of our youths as she sat there
[2:01:27] and told them she never even heard about
[2:01:29] Daniel in the Lion's Den till she was 16
[2:01:33] years
[2:01:35] old but God had a great purpose for her
[2:01:39] life sisters brothers young men young
[2:01:44] women when he saves you and baptizes you
[2:01:47] into the
[2:01:48] body he has a place for you and no no
[2:01:52] one can take your
[2:01:55] place might be to encourage might be to
[2:01:58] sing maybe some of you are not
[2:02:01] soloist but maybe God would give you a
[2:02:03] good voice when the choir sings where
[2:02:06] you could merge in with them some of you
[2:02:09] in your ministry it may never be
[2:02:11] acknowledged publicly from this
[2:02:14] Pulpit but when you walk before the Lord
[2:02:17] Jesus may you be like that little woman
[2:02:22] that God put it on her heart she was not
[2:02:25] a preacher but she just kept feeling it
[2:02:28] in her
[2:02:30] heart to have a meeting there in the
[2:02:32] little Community where she lived but she
[2:02:35] was no preacher how could she do it so
[2:02:38] she runs a a little old building and
[2:02:42] talks to a preacher that she
[2:02:44] knows and the preacher comes and
[2:02:47] preaches and a little boy comes up to
[2:02:50] the altar long has shaggy
[2:02:53] hair gives his heart to
[2:02:56] God that preacher LED thousands if not
[2:03:00] Millions to the Lord
[2:03:03] Jesus when he stands there to get his
[2:03:07] reward no doubt God will call that
[2:03:09] little woman we don't even know what her
[2:03:12] name
[2:03:13] is but God didn't want her to be without
[2:03:16] a
[2:03:18] reward little mothers little single
[2:03:21] girls sisters at our church you've got
[2:03:24] something to
[2:03:27] do heavenly father I come before you
[2:03:33] today I'm thanking
[2:03:36] you you didn't give to me a Ministry
[2:03:39] like brother Tim that would be called
[2:03:42] The Prince of
[2:03:44] preachers maybe brother Ron that would
[2:03:46] have such great Miracles or brother
[2:03:50] Daryl as he travels around the world
[2:03:54] and has absolutely phenomenal things
[2:03:57] happen in his
[2:03:59] ministry maybe Lord some of these
[2:04:01] brothers from Africa and India and
[2:04:03] around the
[2:04:04] world Lord Jesus I want to be faithful
[2:04:08] to what you've given
[2:04:10] me maybe brother John brother Michael
[2:04:13] brother Jonathan some of these other
[2:04:15] brothers saying Lord Brother Pete what
[2:04:18] am I supposed to do what do you want me
[2:04:19] to do Lord help me
[2:04:23] me was talking to one of them not long
[2:04:26] ago and I said
[2:04:27] brother I'd rather have three doors to
[2:04:30] preach in that God gave
[2:04:32] me than to have a whole bunch of doors
[2:04:35] that I open Myself by calling preachers
[2:04:38] and trying to promote
[2:04:41] yourself and it's sad to say Lord but we
[2:04:44] have so many especially the younger
[2:04:46] message preachers that are doing
[2:04:49] that Lord I want what you give me I
[2:04:52] don't want to have to ride on the
[2:04:53] coattail of another man so I can build
[2:04:56] my platform on them
[2:04:58] Paul even practice that and I'd like to
[2:05:01] bring it to him sometime if you'd let
[2:05:04] me that he chose not to even go name the
[2:05:08] name of Christ he said where it had been
[2:05:11] mentioned lest he would build on another
[2:05:15] man's
[2:05:18] foundation and if it wasn't for some
[2:05:20] preachers only had
[2:05:22] being identified under the reputation of
[2:05:24] another man they would have
[2:05:27] nothing Lord Jesus we don't want to be
[2:05:30] identified with this man that man we
[2:05:32] want to be identified with you so if you
[2:05:36] give us a work and it may seems small
[2:05:39] but if that's what you gave us you make
[2:05:41] no
[2:05:42] mistakes I'd rather have my small work
[2:05:45] than have a big work and fall flat on my
[2:05:47] face because I was not designed to carry
[2:05:50] that type of load and responsibility
[2:05:53] I've seen men because they felt like
[2:05:54] they were not being used enough they
[2:05:57] would venture out beyond what they were
[2:05:59] ordained to do and wind up destroying
[2:06:02] their family because of
[2:06:05] it help each young man each young woman
[2:06:08] Lord God I pray you'd move among our
[2:06:10] youths and help them
[2:06:13] Father maybe some of them will be like
[2:06:15] the household of
[2:06:17] stephanus they will addict themselves
[2:06:22] Lord I I'm GL I'm glad and grateful that
[2:06:25] brother Rob has some ideas sometimes of
[2:06:27] them doing things and brother Joe not
[2:06:30] just prayer meetings and not just
[2:06:32] services but making little gift baskets
[2:06:36] and taking it to the shut tins and maybe
[2:06:39] getting together with a guitar and going
[2:06:41] and maybe ministering to them what that
[2:06:44] is
[2:06:45] worth then people sitting there for
[2:06:48] hours on in with nobody to come and
[2:06:50] visit them and see them and then they
[2:06:52] wonder what they can do for
[2:06:56] God you told us in your word I was sick
[2:06:59] and you visited
[2:07:01] me I was naked and you clothed me and
[2:07:04] the righteous will say when did we ever
[2:07:05] see you Lord and you said when you did
[2:07:09] this to the least of these my
[2:07:11] brothers you do it to me help our young
[2:07:15] people to realize when they get together
[2:07:17] maybe make a
[2:07:19] meal and take it to some of the shutting
[2:07:21] and so they go sing to
[2:07:24] them they may not realize it but they're
[2:07:27] singing to
[2:07:30] Jesus brother Bram after the Christmas
[2:07:33] event there in 59 or 61 I don't remember
[2:07:37] which and the church had bought him a
[2:07:39] suit and brother Neville a suit and he
[2:07:41] gets up to thank him afterwards for
[2:07:42] doing
[2:07:43] so and he prayed that you'd bless them
[2:07:46] and he said help them to
[2:07:47] realize they bought them two suits for
[2:07:54] Jesus oh God forgive
[2:07:58] us how much of our life have we
[2:08:02] wasted wanting to do great big
[2:08:06] things and we've stepped over multitudes
[2:08:09] of little
[2:08:10] things we could do every
[2:08:13] day forgive me
[2:08:16] Jesus I realize I'm an old man I don't
[2:08:20] know how many more years I've got on the
[2:08:21] Earth but how much every time I've got
[2:08:24] left help me that I'll not just reach
[2:08:27] for big things it's hard it's hard when
[2:08:30] you have a global Ministry and a Global
[2:08:32] Effect and you're contacted from around
[2:08:34] the world it's hard Lord to keep that
[2:08:36] balance of the little small tiny tiny
[2:08:40] things that are so
[2:08:43] important I imagine brother Collins he
[2:08:46] told me about it years ago the first
[2:08:49] time that he saw brother brandham
[2:08:52] he walked into his house and was
[2:08:53] introduced to him brother brandham and
[2:08:56] sister brandham were washing
[2:08:58] dishes brother Brandon was standing
[2:09:00] there with an apron
[2:09:02] on Elijah with an apron on washing
[2:09:08] dishes but maybe sister mey needed his
[2:09:13] presence help us Brothers to
[2:09:16] realize sometimes it's not the great big
[2:09:18] things we do for our wife and our
[2:09:20] children it's just them little small
[2:09:23] things to let them know we're thinking
[2:09:25] about it maybe just a random text in the
[2:09:27] middle of the day with no particular
[2:09:30] thing to say other than I'm sorry I
[2:09:33] haven't told you today I love
[2:09:35] you I want you to know you're the woman
[2:09:38] of my
[2:09:40] dreams oh Jesus forgive us
[2:09:45] Lord we love you
[2:09:48] father thank you Lord can we stand
[2:09:50] together
[2:09:55] praise the
[2:09:58] Lord praise the
[2:10:03] Lord I worship you
[2:10:08] Jesus I worship you Lord
[2:10:12] God thank you
[2:10:15] Father praise the Lord praise the
[2:10:20] Lord what ever you are whoever you are
[2:10:23] whatever gender you
[2:10:26] are the Lord has a Ministry for you if
[2:10:29] you've been baptized into his body maybe
[2:10:31] you're seed and have been baptized yet
[2:10:34] but he'll have one there waiting for you
[2:10:36] when you get
[2:10:38] there you're a father you're a mother
[2:10:42] you're a young person in our church use
[2:10:45] your
[2:10:46] influence to influence
[2:10:48] others a young lady
[2:10:51] you older sisters maybe your children
[2:10:53] are gone your grandchildren are out and
[2:10:56] doing their own thing well brother
[2:10:57] Donnie I ain't got no more don't you
[2:10:58] never think that you keep on praying you
[2:11:01] keep trying to influence others that you
[2:11:04] go to church with let them see your life
[2:11:06] remember a life lived by the word is the
[2:11:11] word
[2:11:13] expressed the word
[2:11:16] expressed let's sing something together
[2:11:19] he let me just be honest with you this
[2:11:21] morning I would much rather be some of
[2:11:25] you who think you are doing
[2:11:28] nothing than I would
[2:11:32] preachers who overstep this message and
[2:11:36] seemingly are doing great
[2:11:38] things but they're doing it on the
[2:11:42] foundation of
[2:11:44] error you see I run across a quote the
[2:11:46] other day or brother bam telling about
[2:11:48] adding to the word and taking away from
[2:11:50] the word
[2:11:51] I never found any other place where he
[2:11:53] said it quite like this it's it's
[2:11:56] amazing and he was warning people not to
[2:12:00] take the word and polish it
[2:12:04] up to meet the
[2:12:08] day so you don't take it and throw it
[2:12:11] away you don't take and cut it all to
[2:12:14] pieces but you just polish
[2:12:19] it you just make it easy so you know we
[2:12:22] don't we rough the the rough edges we
[2:12:25] polish them off and we don't say this
[2:12:27] word cuz we've got another word that's
[2:12:29] smoother easier nicer more
[2:12:31] gentle and you polish it up and he said
[2:12:35] your part will be taken from The Book of
[2:12:42] Life oh don't you love him with all your
[2:12:48] heart how many feels like you need help
[2:12:51] amen with your ministry your ministry as
[2:12:53] a mother your ministry as a father your
[2:12:56] ministry as a young person in our church
[2:12:58] and you realize the Lord spoke to you
[2:13:00] today and you've not used your influence
