[8:20] him in my soul.
[8:23] My God is real.
[8:27] He's real in my soul.
[8:32] My God is real. For he has washed and
[8:36] made me whole.
[8:40] His love for me. Aren't you glad it is?
[8:44] It's like pure gold.
[8:48] My God is real. For I can feel him in my

[8:56] Oh my God is real.
[9:01] He's real in my soul.
[9:05] My God is real for he has washed and

[9:13] His love for me.
[9:17] It's like pure gold.
[9:22] My God is real for I can feel him in my
[9:27] soul.
[9:30] There are some things
[9:33] [Music]
[9:34] I may not know
[9:38] and there are some places
[9:42] I
[9:43] I can't go.
[9:47] But I am sure to say it
[9:51] of this one thing.
[9:55] My God is real for I can feel him deep
[10:00] within.
[10:02] Sing it now.
[10:05] [Music]
[10:11] Oh, sing it.
[10:19] Oh, his love for me.
[10:24] It's like pure gold.
[10:28] My God is real or I can't feel him in my
[10:34] soul.
[10:36] I cannot tell
[10:40] just how you failed
[10:45] when Jesus took
[10:48] all your sins
[10:50] away.
[10:53] But since that day, I know this. And
[10:57] since that hour,
[11:01] our God's been real. For I can feel his
[11:06] holy power.
[11:09] Our God is real. Say it.
[11:14] He's real.
[11:18] My God is real. For he has washed and
[11:22] made me whole.
[11:26] His love for me
[11:30] is like pure gold.
[11:34] My God is real for I can feel him in my
[11:40] soul.
[11:45] Hallelujah.
[11:47] Oh, give him a real good hand clap of
[11:49] praise in the house of the Lord.
[11:54] And you know what? Times when we don't
[11:56] feel his presence, his nearness, he's
[12:00] still real.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; He's still on the throne. He's still got
[12:04] everything under his control. Do you
[12:06] believe that this morning? Look at your
[12:08] neighbor and tell them you're glad to
[12:09] see him in the house of the Lord.
[12:11] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[12:15] Jesus.
[12:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a privilege it is to be
[12:21] in the house of the Lord this morning.
[12:24] So glad to have each and every one of
[12:25] you here. We've got a lot of visitors
[12:27] among us today. And we want to say at
[12:29] this time if you are a visitor, we
[12:31] certainly welcome you to our assembly.
[12:34] Want you to feel at home. You're one of
[12:37] us. We're going to have a good time in
[12:38] the Lord here today. Right. and any of
[12:41] our streamers locally and around the
[12:43] world that's streaming this service
[12:44] today. May God bless those folks as
[12:47] well. We hope they'll enter in with us
[12:49] and we'll just have church all over the
[12:51] world this morning. Right. Give the Lord
[12:53] another good hand clap of praise. Amen.
[12:59] Some folks may doubt
[13:03] and some may scorn.
[13:07] All can desert
[13:10] and leave me alone.
[13:15] But as for me,
[13:19] I'll take God's part.
[13:23] For God is real and I can feel him in my
[13:29] heart.
[13:31] Oh, our God is real.
[13:35] He's real in my soul.
[13:39] My God is real for he has washed and
[13:44] made me whole.
[13:48] His love for me. Yes, it is. It's like
[13:52] pure gold.
[13:56] My God is real. For I can feel him in my
[14:01] soul.
[14:06] Praise the Lord. Amen. I'm going to let
[14:09] you be seated for just a little bit. We
[14:11] got a lot of prayer requests that we
[14:13] want to let you know about this morning.
[14:15] First of all, an an announcement. If you
[14:18] if you have today, you have today and
[14:20] Wednesday to submit personal or business
[14:23] changes to the church directory. Please
[14:26] come to the library and submit those
[14:28] changes if you want to make some of
[14:30] those. uh today and Wednesday will be
[14:33] the last time you'll be able to do that.
[14:35] Well, remember
[14:36] I texted Brother Wes RD the other
[14:38] morning and asked him if they they were
[14:40] coming up to the fall festival and he
[14:43] said they really had planned on and
[14:45] wanted to but Amanda's mother, Sister
[14:48] Naomi Jeff passed away on I believe it
[14:51] was Friday morning about 7:00. So, we
[14:55] certainly want to want to remember those
[14:56] folks in prayer that the Lord would
[14:58] would just be with them during this
[15:00] time. I believe her service uh according
[15:02] to what I understand will be tomorrow.
[15:04] So we will remember uh the Jeffre,
[15:07] Brother Wes and Amanda and the family
[15:09] that the Lord would just be mindful of
[15:10] them. Sister Janet Kennedy says to
[15:13] please remember a coworker and a
[15:14] friend's brother. A car fell on him and
[15:17] he has six broken ribs, small lung
[15:20] collapse and puncture air caught in his
[15:23] chest. So they're asking that we would
[15:24] remember that prayer request this
[15:26] morning. Brother Terry Stockton asking
[15:28] the church to pray for his son-in-law
[15:30] over a legal matter. The Lord knows all
[15:32] about that need.
[15:34] Judith Barry says,
[15:37] "Please pray for my youngest brother who
[15:39] was recently diagnosed with esophagical
[15:42] cancer. I believe my brother will be one
[15:44] of the many who recently have testified
[15:46] of being healed from cancer. Thank you
[15:48] and may God bless." So, we certainly
[15:50] want to pray for that need today as we
[15:53] go on into the service. Uh, please
[15:56] remember brother Howard, sister Collins
[15:58] in prayer. Brother Howard fell off of a
[16:00] ladder and landed on his jeep, hurt his
[16:02] leg and hip. Sister has been under the
[16:04] weather for a few days battling a cough.
[16:07] Your prayers will be greatly
[16:08] appreciated. So, we want to remember
[16:10] them. Brother Randy Scott is thanking
[16:12] you for your prayers. Been in the
[16:14] hospital, had two stances put in. Uh,
[16:16] they did find some blockage. Uh, that's
[16:19] been going on for about four weeks now.
[16:21] and they're just asking that we would
[16:23] continue to remember him in prayer and
[16:25] he thanks the Lord for touching him thus
[16:27] far. Brother Greg Robbins tripped and
[16:29] fell yesterday. His hip has hurt him
[16:32] from the fall. He can barely walk today.
[16:34] He is also asking that we pray for his
[16:36] cousin in Richmond. He had hip surgery
[16:38] and the wound is infected. So we want to
[16:40] remember that. Sister Ruth Louise Jax is
[16:44] asking for prayer for a situation with
[16:46] her daughter. The Lord knows all about
[16:47] that. We commit it to the Lord. Sister
[16:50] Martha Sacker sends us in to please pray
[16:53] for my aunt Reeba Jones who is having a
[16:55] lot of nerve pain this morning. Remember
[16:58] that. I want to remember Ashley Bab this
[17:00] morning, not feeling well, sick and
[17:02] body. Please keep Amanda Walker in
[17:05] prayer. She will be having surgery on
[17:06] Friday morning. Brother James sends that
[17:09] in. So, let's remember that.
[17:12] Sister Mary Anthony says to please pray
[17:13] for an unspoken prayer request. The Lord
[17:15] knows all about that need. Prayer for
[17:18] Cota Gilth. Sevenyear-old boy just found
[17:21] out that he has stage four leukemia.
[17:24] Brother Chase Hugh sends that in. So we
[17:25] want to remember that child. Want to
[17:27] remember Ed Jablonsky senior for
[17:30] Parkinson's and prostate problems
[17:33] needing prayer. So let's remember him as
[17:35] we pray. Brother Frank and Sister Jackie
[17:37] Williams are requesting prayer for Dave
[17:39] Wilcox who has cancer of the bladder.
[17:42] Scheduled for surgery on Monday. Also,
[17:44] Brother Frank is scheduled for back
[17:46] surgery on Tuesday morning at 7 a.m. at
[17:48] the VA. Brother Frank says he loves
[17:50] everyone and would appreciate your
[17:52] prayers that surgeries for him and Dave
[17:54] Wilcox will go well and they will have a
[17:56] speedy recovery. So, we want to remember
[17:58] that this morning as we pray.
[18:04] [Music]
[18:07] Here's a testimony. Sister Phoebe turns
[18:09] this in. We want to praise the Lord. My
[18:12] brother had several scans this past
[18:14] Thursday and the doctor told him that
[18:17] there is no sign of cancer. Thank you so
[18:20] much for your prayers. Somebody say
[18:22] praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[18:26] Amen.
[18:28] Sister Sarah Carol sends us in for her
[18:30] brother Daniel Ser. He will be having a
[18:33] very serious surgery on his back this
[18:34] coming Tuesday, October the 14th.
[18:37] Without the surgery, he will lose his
[18:39] ability to walk. Following the surgery,
[18:41] you will be unable to work for about
[18:42] three months. Her family certainly
[18:44] appreciates all of your prayers. So,
[18:46] let's remember that as we pray. Sister
[18:48] Hope Maddie Maddie is requesting prayer.
[18:51] She's at home not feeling well this
[18:53] morning. So, we want to remember her as
[18:54] we pray that the Lord would be mindful
[18:56] of her. Uh want to welcome Sister Morero
[19:01] this morning to the service. Uh
[19:04] well, we all know who she is, but we're
[19:06] so glad to have her in the service this
[19:08] morning. God bless you. Brother Robert's
[19:09] wife visited from from New York. So, we
[19:12] just want to welcome her and all the
[19:14] other visitors. As I said while ago, may
[19:16] God bless you. Uh this announcement uh
[19:19] if you need fall decorations and you
[19:21] need fodder for your fall decorations,
[19:24] they have plenty that's available. You
[19:26] can pick it up down here around the
[19:28] pavilion. And uh brother Michael wanted
[19:31] you to know that. Now, to all that was
[19:33] involved in the fall festival, took
[19:34] part, participated, came, enjoyed the
[19:38] fellowship, and and worked just like I
[19:41] never seen anybody work any harder than
[19:42] what this group did here. We want to say
[19:45] a great big thank you to all that took
[19:48] part. Could we give those folks a good
[19:50] hand this morning?
[19:52] [Music]
[19:55] Praise the Lord.
[19:57] just really really appreciate all the
[19:59] effort and I I do believe that everybody
[20:02] had a good time. I trust you did. Praise
[20:05] the Lord. Our God is real. We've read a
[20:08] lot of needs. We gave some testimonies
[20:11] through it all. God's got it under his
[20:14] control. We're committed to that, right?
[20:17] Sometimes he'll say no. We want to be
[20:19] just as good with that as if he said yes
[20:22] because he know papa knows best. Right?
[20:24] Could we stand together this morning?
[20:26] You have an unspoken prayer request
[20:28] you'd like for this group to pray about,
[20:30] we'll just commit all these things unto
[20:31] the Lord. Brother John, if you'd come
[20:33] this morning, take us to the Lord in
[20:35] prayer. Where's Brother John Hornyak at?
[20:41] He's here. There he is right there.
[20:45] [Music]
[20:46] We love Brother John, don't we? Amen.
[20:50] Let's sing that little course together
[20:52] one more time. My God is real. I want
[20:54] you to sing it with everything you got
[20:56] this morning. If you believe it, he's
[20:58] worth praising this morning. Right,
[21:00] somebody say, "Praise the Lord." Give
[21:02] him one more good hand clap of praise.
[21:05] My God is real.
[21:09] He's real in my soul.
[21:13] My God is real. For I keep
[21:18] and make me whole.
[21:22] His love for me
[21:26] is like real gold.
[21:30] My God is real. For I can feel him in my
[21:36] soul.
[21:39] Amen.
[21:41] He don't only show us he's real from our
[21:43] heart, but he manifests
[21:46] day after day after day. We can see him
[21:49] in all these requests. So many
[21:51] testimonies, so many needs, but he's
[21:54] real in all this.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the Lord in prayer.
[21:58] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[22:01] we're so glad, Lord, that you're just so
[22:04] real to us, Lord. You're not just a
[22:07] story. You're not just a a a rumor we've
[22:10] heard, Lord, but we've experienced you,
[22:12] Lord. You are a reality in our lives,
[22:15] Father.
[22:17] Lord, there's no denying anybody, Lord,
[22:19] that's really come in contact with you,
[22:21] Father. They they know that it's it it's
[22:25] so much more than than than actually a
[22:29] lot of the church people feel, Lord,
[22:31] because you've you've come to us and
[22:34] you've spoke to us and we've had that
[22:36] communication, that time with you, Lord.
[22:38] We just want to say thank you, Lord. We
[22:40] love you so much, Lord. We've seen you
[22:43] in our lives, Lord. And Lord, that's
[22:46] other people have seen you in our lives
[22:48] as well, Father. That's why we can bring
[22:50] these requests boldly before your
[22:52] throne, Lord. We know, Lord Jesus, that
[22:55] there's an answer in each and every one
[22:57] of these, Lord. And we pray, Father,
[22:59] that you would just move according to
[23:01] your will, your purpose, Lord. Help us
[23:03] to be willing, Lord Jesus, to to say
[23:06] yes. And help us to be able to accept,
[23:09] Father, what you have for us, Lord
[23:10] Jesus. and not only on in physical
[23:13] things, Lord, or financial things, but
[23:15] also spiritual things, Lord Jesus. We we
[23:18] want to grow in you, Father. We want to
[23:20] be attentive to you, Lord Jesus. We pray
[23:22] that you would just move for us, Lord,
[23:24] in a mighty way, Lord. Oh, Father, you
[23:27] know, Lord Jesus, that sometimes we hear
[23:29] things that we don't want to hear and
[23:31] we, Lord, we our flesh backs away from
[23:35] it, Lord Jesus. But if it's for our
[23:37] best, Lord, we want, Lord Jesus, you to
[23:39] speak to our hearts, Lord. That's why
[23:41] we're here today, Father. We ask that
[23:43] you would just move, Lord. Help us draw
[23:46] closer to you, nearer to you, every
[23:48] every moment of the day. Lord Jesus, we
[23:50] love you. We thank you. Be with us in
[23:52] this service today, Lord. Anoint each
[23:55] and every part. May we just enter into
[23:57] worship and praise with you, Lord, with
[23:59] the sincerity of our heart, Lord. And
[24:01] may we hear from you, Father. Anoint the
[24:03] the ministry, Lord Jesus. We pray, we
[24:06] love you, we thank you in Jesus name.
[24:09] Amen.
[24:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother John. God bless

[24:20] bless you. We're so glad to have each
[24:22] and every one of you here. Let's sing an
[24:24] old song this morning. Heaven's Jubilee.
[24:27] We're fixing to have a jubilee that's
[24:28] never been experienced like the one
[24:31] we're getting ready to, right? Somebody
[24:33] say, "Praise the Lord."
[24:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[24:37] Some glad morning we shall see. Jesus in
[24:41] the air
[24:43] coming after you and me. All the joys to
[24:47] share.
[24:49] What rejoicing there will be when the
[24:52] saints shall rise

[28:14] Praise the Lord. You can be seated this
[28:16] morning. Give our singers a nice hand as
[28:19] they sing for you today. Sister Burns,
[28:22] if you want to come
[28:46] [Music]
[28:54] [Music]
[29:10] I woke up the other night. I thought I
[29:15] was having a dream.
[29:18] I thought I heard a very loud noise, but
[29:23] dreams are never as they seem.
[29:27] I dreamed the end of time had come. I
[29:32] hoped it wasn't real.
[29:35] I remember thinking what I hadn't done.
[29:40] Then everything got real still.
[29:48] [Music]
[29:52] At the sounding of the trumpet,
[29:57] in the twinkling of an eye,
[30:01] where had I heard these words before?
[30:05] Oh, look at the eastern sky.
[30:09] I never thought you'd come so soon. I
[30:14] never read the signs.
[30:18] I never worried about the end. For I
[30:22] thought I'd have more time.
[30:28] He's coming
[30:31] and I can't stop it.
[30:36] It's not a dream anymore.
[30:43] There goes my father,
[30:46] my mother,
[30:48] my sister, and my brother.
[30:52] [Music]
[30:54] They're all going
[30:57] home.
[30:59] [Music]
[31:17] I went to church on Sunday, read my
[31:21] Bible once a week,
[31:24] and on two occasions every year, I tried
[31:29] to be humble and meek.
[31:33] Are you saying, "Lord, it wasn't
[31:36] enough?" Are you saying it was all in
[31:39] vain?
[31:41] Don't take this time to remind me. I
[31:45] promised you everything.
[31:52] [Music]
[31:58] Well, everyone is gone now. And I'm here
[32:03] all alone.
[32:04] [Music]
[32:06] I thought I was a Christian,
[32:10] but oh Lord, was I wrong
[32:13] for praying a prayer and singing a song
[32:17] and responding to an altar call.
[32:21] Now I know that's not what it takes. I
[32:26] should have made him Lord of all. Oh,
[32:33] he's coming
[32:36] and I can't stop it.
[32:41] It's not a dream anymore.
[32:48] For I see Jesus
[32:52] standing as our father.
[32:57] Not for me.
[33:00] [Music]
[33:01] They close
[33:04] the door.
[33:09] [Music]
[33:18] [Applause]
[33:38] [Music]
[33:59] If you have felt the dark of night,
[34:04] questioning what is out of sight, he is
[34:09] the answer. He is the light.
[34:13] [Music]
[34:17] If you have felt the weight of sin,
[34:21] bound by the shame that hand you in,
[34:26] he'll break the chains. He will forgive.
[34:34] Lift your head.
[34:38] Morning is coming. There's more to the
[34:41] story. Don't forget.
[34:47] In grief and in glory, still great is
[34:50] his faithfulness.
[34:55] [Music]
[34:58] If you felt broken and betrayed, no one
[35:03] to trust alone, afraid,
[35:06] he'll comfort you. He knows your name.
[35:11] [Music]
[35:15] If you've wrestled with the ache of loss
[35:20] and why this has been your road to walk,
[35:24] he bore your pain. He wore your cross.
[35:32] So lift your head.
[35:37] Morning is coming. There's more to the
[35:40] story. Don't forget.
[35:45] In grief and in glory, still great is
[35:48] his faithfulness.
[35:54] Wait on him. Rest in him. Come find your
[35:58] peace again. Trust in him. Hope in him.
[36:01] Great is his faithfulness. Wait on him.
[36:04] Rest in him. Come find your peace again.
[36:08] Trust in him. Hope in him. Great is his
[36:11] faithfulness.
[36:17] Great is thy faithfulness.
[36:22] Great is thy faithfulness.
[36:26] Morning
[36:28] by morning,
[36:30] new mercies
[36:32] I see.
[36:38] Lift your head.
[36:42] Morning is coming. There's more to the
[36:45] story. Don't forget.
[36:51] In grief and in glory, still great is
[36:54] his faithfulness.
[37:00] In grief and in glory, still great is
[37:03] his faithfulness.
[37:06] He's so faithful.
[37:09] In grief and in glory, still great is
[37:13] his faithfulness.
[37:17] [Music]
[37:23] [Applause]
[37:50] You can all help me sing this.
[37:53] Worthy,
[37:55] worthy is the lamb.
[37:58] [Music]
[38:08] Thank you for the cross,
[38:11] Lord.
[38:15] Thank you for the price
[38:19] you
[38:20] paid,
[38:22] bearing all my sin and shame.
[38:27] In love, you came
[38:31] and gave amazing
[38:34] grace.
[38:38] Thank you for this love
[38:42] Lord.
[38:45] Thank you for the nail
[38:49] pierced
[38:51] hands
[38:52] washed me in your cleansing flow.
[38:57] Now all I know your forgiveness
[39:03] and embrace.
[39:08] Worthy is the lamb
[39:15] seated on the throne.
[39:22] crown you now with many crowns.
[39:29] You reign victorious.
[39:36] Oh high and lifted
[39:39] up.
[39:43] Jesus, son of God,
[39:49] the darling of heaven,
[39:53] crucified.
[39:58] Worthy is the lamb.
[40:03] Worthy is the lamb.
[40:07] [Music]
[40:10] Thank you for the cross,
[40:14] Lord.
[40:17] We thank you for the price
[40:21] you paid.
[40:24] Bearing all my sin and shame.
[40:29] In love, you came
[40:32] and gave amazing
[40:36] grace.
[40:40] Thank you for this love,
[40:43] Lord.
[40:46] We thank you for the nail
[40:50] pierced
[40:52] hands
[40:54] washed me in your cleansing flow.
[40:59] How all I know your forgiveness
[41:04] and embrace.
[41:09] Oh, worthy is the lamb
[41:16] seated on the throne.
[41:23] We crown you now with many crowns.
[41:30] You reign victorious.
[41:36] Oh high and lifted
[41:40] up.
[41:43] Jesus, son of God,
[41:48] [Music]
[41:50] the darling of heaven,
[41:54] crucified.
[41:59] Oh, worthy is the lamb.
[42:06] Yes, worthy is the lamb.
[42:10] [Music]
[42:13] Oh, worthy
[42:15] is
[42:17] the
[42:19] lamb.
[42:27] [Music]
[42:30] [Applause]
[42:35] Praise the Lord.
[42:38] So grateful today for his great love and
[42:40] mercy to us.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where would we be without him?
[42:45] &gt;&gt; Where would we be without his grace? We
[42:48] certainly welcome each of you here
[42:49] today. All the visitors that are in our
[42:52] gates, we appreciate you being here as
[42:54] well. Let's turn to Song of Solomon if
[42:57] you would today. Chapter 4, verse 1.
[43:02] Song of Solomon, chapter 4, verse one.
[43:07] Listen
[43:09] carefully to these
[43:12] four verses here.
[43:15] Song of Solomon was called the Holy of
[43:19] Holies
[43:20] of the Old Testament.
[43:23] The Jews would not even let their
[43:25] children read this book until they
[43:29] become of age
[43:31] because of the
[43:34] seriousness of it of course and the way
[43:36] that they looked at it.
[43:38] So whenever we read it, we want to keep
[43:42] in mind that
[43:44] it is about Solomon and the Schulamite,
[43:49] but it is more than that. It's it's a
[43:53] for a figure of the Lord Jesus and his
[43:56] bride.
[43:58] And if you fit in these verses today,
[44:02] you ought to be the happiest one of
[44:04] them, happiest people in the world.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; If you fit in these verses now, many
[44:11] people think they do, of course, and
[44:13] they don't. Many church members that
[44:15] belong to all kinds of churches and even
[44:17] some message people think that they do.
[44:20] But yet if we do, I love the statement
[44:23] that the prophet makes. Son of God seed
[44:27] produces son of God seed.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; So if you're a son of God, a daughter of
[44:34] God, then out of your life will come
[44:37] forth the original product of God's
[44:40] word. Is that right?
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Sure. You're still a human. You'll have
[44:43] your battles and things like that, but
[44:46] let's read carefully.
[44:48] Behold,
[44:50] thou art fair, my love.
[44:54] Behold,
[44:56] thou art fair.
[44:58] Apparently, she needed to hear it twice
[45:02] cuz she knew herself.
[45:06] Thou hast dove's eyes
[45:09] within thy locks.
[45:12] The hair is as a flock of goats
[45:15] that appear from Mount Gilead.
[45:18] Now, let me just say, you young brothers
[45:20] that have a girlfriend, if I was you, I
[45:23] wouldn't tell her this
[45:26] because she will not appreciate it. If
[45:29] you tell her your hair looks just like
[45:30] goat hair, um you might be eating your
[45:34] meals out of a straw for a few days.
[45:38] But to the women of this era and to the
[45:42] types and the shadows and all the things
[45:44] that's in here, this is a very great
[45:45] compliment because to have black goats,
[45:48] the black hair, it was the the greatest
[45:51] price of the goats. Very very shiny, a
[45:54] real sheen about them. So to her she
[45:57] would have took this as a as a
[45:59] compliment. Thy teeths are like a flock
[46:02] of sheep that are even shorn which came
[46:06] up from the washing whereof
[46:10] everyone bear twins
[46:14] and none is barren among them.
[46:17] Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet.
[46:20] Now watch each one of these little
[46:22] phrases. It has something a meaning. Thy
[46:26] lips are like a thread of scarlet. So
[46:30] out of her mouth, she's speaking of
[46:32] redemption, scarlet, and mercy. And thy
[46:36] speech is comely.
[46:40] Thy temples are like a piece of a
[46:43] pomegranate within thy locks.
[46:47] Thy neck is like the tower of David.
[46:51] build it for an armory. Who are we
[46:54] talking about? We're talking about the
[46:55] bride.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; So look at her face. Notice focusing on
[47:00] her face and then coming from her face
[47:03] down to her neck. And then her neck is
[47:06] like a tower. So it's an armory. So in
[47:09] there hangs the weapons of great valiant
[47:13] men that have been identified with her.
[47:17] Thy neck is like the tower of David,
[47:19] builded for an army where on there hang
[47:22] a thousand bucklers,
[47:26] all shields
[47:28] of mighty men.
[47:30] Let's bow our heads together. How many
[47:32] like to be remembered today as we pray?
[47:36] Heavenly Father, as we've assembled here
[47:39] today and we want you to know that we're
[47:42] so grateful, Father, for the opportunity
[47:45] that we can be together, we thank you
[47:47] for our time that we could have together
[47:49] here at the Fall Fest. And um our
[47:52] friends that have come to be with us,
[47:54] brothers and sisters from different
[47:55] places, and we are honored that they
[47:58] would come and spend a few days with us.
[48:00] And it reminds us that one day, Lord,
[48:03] when we will stack our arms for the last
[48:06] time and we go home and all of the
[48:09] soldiers of God are able to gather
[48:11] together. No more fighting, no more war,
[48:15] no more difficulties.
[48:17] Lord Jesus, each of us come here today
[48:19] to church. We have needs in our lives.
[48:22] We have desires. We have areas that we
[48:25] need help, Father. and we're not ashamed
[48:28] to bring those needs to you. Help us, I
[48:31] pray. Minister to every heart. Help me
[48:33] to get out of the way. Father, speak to
[48:36] us the words of life. In the name of the
[48:39] Lord Jesus, we ask it. And the saint
[48:41] said,
[48:43] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated.
[48:47] I want to speak to you from
[48:50] verse seven.
[48:52] And I want you to notice that the
[48:54] seventh verse
[48:56] is where he talks about her and she's
[49:01] reached
[49:03] a spot in his eyes
[49:06] which only he would be able to achieve.
[49:10] Thou art fair.
[49:13] My love,
[49:15] my love, there is no spot in thee.
[49:22] Now all fair is a state of perfection
[49:25] and beauty, perfect comeliness,
[49:30] and it's not her own. It's not that she
[49:33] has finally been able to meet all these
[49:36] standards, the dos and the don'ts, and
[49:38] thou shalts, and thou shalt not. and
[49:41] she's been able to do that and she's
[49:43] actually arrived and she's living a
[49:46] faultless human life. There is no such a
[49:50] thing.
[49:51] The mystery is not that God will wait
[49:54] for his bride, his people to get to a
[49:57] spot to where that every one of them who
[50:00] go in the rapture will finally reach a
[50:03] place where they'll never make another
[50:05] mistake. Even Walt Disney couldn't make
[50:08] something that far out.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; You're always going to be a human being
[50:13] until you're changed.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; And you're going to need the mercy of
[50:16] the Lord Jesus. I don't care how long
[50:18] you've been saved, how long you've been
[50:20] around the message.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; But yet, whenever you look at it in the
[50:25] right way, and I know that there's
[50:27] always been people that have taken this
[50:29] part of God and his nature and his
[50:32] character, and they go to either one
[50:35] side or the other, either the legalistic
[50:37] side or the grace side so much that you
[50:40] can do pretty much whatever you want to
[50:41] do, live any life that you want to live,
[50:44] and God accepts you, you'll go to hell
[50:46] doing that.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; God requires a holy, godly life.
[50:52] Is that right?
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; But now it shows her completeness is not
[50:57] in herself. It's him saying this about
[51:01] her. It's not her saying it about
[51:04] herself. It's not even her family
[51:07] members or her pastor or her friends or
[51:10] neighbors that are saying this about
[51:11] her. It's him. And he's the only one
[51:14] that could say it. Read with me in
[51:16] Colossians 1 22. in the body of his
[51:20] flesh through death to present you holy
[51:24] and unblameable
[51:27] and unreprovable
[51:29] in his sight.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Not in your own.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Not in the sight of others,
[51:35] &gt;&gt; but in his sight. Unblamable means
[51:38] without blemish. The word was applied to
[51:42] the temple sacrifices which had to be
[51:45] offered without blemish. Unreprovable
[51:48] means free from accusation. Amen.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Once we have been reconciled to God, no
[51:54] charges can be brought against us if
[51:57] we're in Christ Jesus. Now, there's the
[51:59] catchy part. There are many who think
[52:02] they're in Christ when in reality,
[52:05] they're on their way, but they've not
[52:07] yet arrived.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; If you don't have the Holy Ghost today
[52:10] in your soul, you're not here.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; You can believe the gospel. You can be
[52:16] saved, sanctified, lay aside this habit,
[52:19] that habit, you even accept the message
[52:21] of the hour. And God sent a prophet, and
[52:23] all that's well and good. Brother
[52:24] Brandham told me, she said, "Well,
[52:26] Brother Brandham, I believe every word
[52:27] you said." He said, "That's just being
[52:30] able to read."
[52:32] &gt;&gt; And that's what the sad thing about it
[52:34] is, friends, I'm afraid around the
[52:36] world, that's where a lot of our message
[52:37] people are. They're just able to read.
[52:40] God sent a prophet. Praise the Lord. and
[52:43] we believe this and we believe that. But
[52:45] if what we believe don't make us like
[52:47] Christ, something's wrong with our
[52:49] belief.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Now, whenever it comes to that spot, you
[52:54] realize that no charges can be uh
[52:56] accepted against us. They can be brought
[52:59] because Satan, the accuser, will
[53:02] constantly go before the throne of God
[53:04] and to accuse us. And many times he
[53:07] accuses us with truths of our failures
[53:10] and our shortcomings. How many still has
[53:12] them?
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. We're glad to
[53:15] have the rest of you angels that are
[53:16] here today. God bless you.
[53:19] But the thing of it is, God will not
[53:22] accept the accusation
[53:24] against a son or daughter of God that is
[53:27] truly in Christ Jesus. Notice in Romans
[53:32] 4:7, saying, "Blessed are they whose
[53:35] iniquities are forgiven, whose sins are
[53:38] covered. Blessed is the man to whom the
[53:42] Lord will not impute sin. Now, is that
[53:47] every Christian? No, it's not. Is that
[53:49] every person who says they love the Lord
[53:51] and they go to church? It is not.
[53:54] Because if it is, they all go in the
[53:55] rapture together. So, there's no need
[53:58] for us to live a sanctified life, a
[54:00] separate life. Everybody's going to
[54:01] heaven anyway. So, you can drink and do
[54:03] whatever you want to do and dope and get
[54:05] high, go to church and scream and
[54:07] holler, "Amen." and the rest of us have
[54:09] to live a godly life. No, there ain't
[54:11] none of that trash going to heaven.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; There ain't going to be no dope addicts
[54:15] in heaven. Ain't going to be no drunks
[54:18] in heaven. Ain't going to be no
[54:19] adulterers, no fornicators, no liars.
[54:22] Come on, y'all want to have church
[54:23] today.
[54:25] If we go to heaven, we're going to live
[54:27] a life that is worthy of the gospel of
[54:30] Jesus Christ. I love the way the prophet
[54:33] in the first seal, he says, "If the
[54:35] church has been judged and they have
[54:38] judged themselves and have accepted the
[54:41] blood, how can God judge a man that's
[54:44] perfectly totally sinless?"
[54:51] &gt;&gt; I wonder out of all these hundreds of
[54:53] people that are here today,
[54:56] how many are this?
[54:58] Of all the thousands times tens of
[55:02] thousands that follow this message, yes,
[55:05] &gt;&gt; how many of them are this one quote?
[55:10] &gt;&gt; That's his beloved.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; That's his beloved. Now watch. How can
[55:17] God judge a man that's perfectly totally
[55:19] sinless? You say there's no such person.
[55:22] And he said, "Every bornagain believer,
[55:25] true believer, is perfectly absolutely
[55:30] sinless before God.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; He's not trusting in his works and the
[55:36] blood of Jesus. That's where his
[55:37] confession is dropped into." And the
[55:40] church said,
[55:41] &gt;&gt; "Well, you say, "I'm not there, brother
[55:43] Donnie." Well, keep on working until you
[55:45] get there. Let God do the work of
[55:48] justification, sanctification until he
[55:51] fills you with the baptism of the Holy
[55:53] Ghost. Then one day you can be able to
[55:55] stand up and say, "I have finally
[55:57] arrived to that quote right there." Some
[56:00] of us want to fulfill quotes of casting
[56:02] out devils and healing the sick, raising
[56:04] the dead, cleansing the lepers. All
[56:06] that's well and good. I want to fulfill
[56:08] them, too. But what good does them do if
[56:11] I can't fulfill this one right here?
[56:13] Actually, casting out devils ain't going
[56:15] to put us in the rapture. But this one
[56:17] here says, "Your destiny is secure."
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Watch this in 1 Thessalonians 3:13. To
[56:23] the end that he may establish your
[56:26] hearts, unblameable in holiness before
[56:29] God, even our father, at the coming of
[56:32] the Lord Jesus Christ with all his
[56:35] saints. Also 1 Thessalonians 5:23, "And
[56:38] the very God of peace sanctify you,
[56:40] holy, I pray God, your whole spirit and
[56:44] soul and body be preserved blameless
[56:49] unto the coming of our Lord Jesus
[56:52] Christ." Second Peter 3:14, "Wherefore,
[56:55] beloved, seeing that ye look for such
[56:57] things, be diligent that you may be
[56:59] found of him in peace without spot and
[57:05] blameless."
[57:07] &gt;&gt; How many believes there's a people like
[57:09] that?
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Now, the next question is, is it you?
[57:17] It's good to believe there's a people
[57:19] that like that,
[57:20] &gt;&gt; but it's even better to know when you
[57:23] have so entered into Christ Jesus that
[57:26] that's you. So, it's like the little boy
[57:28] looking in the mirror that had never
[57:29] seen himself and he waves and the little
[57:32] boy the mirror waves back and he steps.
[57:34] You've heard the prophet tell the story
[57:36] and he goes back and forth and finally
[57:37] he turns around to his mother and he
[57:40] says, "Why mama? That's me.
[57:43] That's me. You see, it will be finally
[57:46] God climaxing the revelation of the
[57:48] bride seeing who she is is what's going
[57:51] to bring the rapture. It's not just us
[57:54] recognize who your mama, your daddy,
[57:56] your favorite preacher is. Listen to me.
[57:59] It's not even just you being able to
[58:00] recognize Brother Brandon was a
[58:02] fulfillment of Malachi 4. But the
[58:04] prophet said, "When the bride sees who
[58:07] she is, then the rapture will go,
[58:12] &gt;&gt; not come,
[58:13] &gt;&gt; go."
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Can anybody say it with me? Help me,
[58:19] Lord.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Now watch again in Jude verse 24. Now
[58:24] unto him that is able to keep you from
[58:27] falling and to present you faultless
[58:31] before the presence of his glory with
[58:36] exceeding joy. Now what I've read to you
[58:39] just so far in this part of the sermon
[58:41] is an absolute masterpiece of almighty
[58:45] God. A work that I have read to you
[58:48] about just in these few a few short
[58:50] verses and a few moments that I've been
[58:52] up here is a masterpiece that only God
[58:55] himself could ever make. None of us on
[58:59] our own can ever make these verses
[59:02] happen in our life. Even the angels of
[59:05] God with their great power would never
[59:08] be able to coax us in to this position.
[59:12] There's only one way we can get there
[59:15] and that is first of all we are invited.
[59:19] The Lord God invites us himself into the
[59:23] inter sanctum of his presence and we are
[59:27] invited into that shikina glory of God
[59:32] to be partakers of his divine nature.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; We are changed. Now, let me let me
[59:40] remind you of of an Old Testament
[59:42] character that many of you Bible readers
[59:44] are familiar with, and his name was
[59:45] Mphibichef. Mphibichef was uh the son of
[59:50] Jonathan. And Jonathan was David's best
[59:54] friend. And they were just buddies. I
[59:56] mean, they were just like that. They
[59:58] loved one another so much. And they were
[1:00:00] so close. And we remember that what
[1:00:03] happened to Mphibicheth was that the
[1:00:05] armies had come in and his nurse grabbed
[1:00:08] him and he's a child and his nurse grabs
[1:00:11] him and she's going to run away with him
[1:00:14] and try to protect him. Now what happens
[1:00:17] is that while she is running with this
[1:00:20] child in her arms, she falls.
[1:00:25] In her fall, she dropped this child
[1:00:30] Mphibicheth.
[1:00:31] And then it caused him to be lame for
[1:00:35] the rest of his life. Now, how was he
[1:00:38] made lame? Because a woman fell and
[1:00:42] whenever she fell, he fell with her.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Come on, Mphibicheth.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Some of you Mphibicheths, you ought to
[1:00:50] see yourself right there. Amen.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; But David, he so loved Jonathan. You
[1:00:55] remember the story of course that Saul
[1:00:57] and Jonathan both their lives taken on
[1:00:59] Mount Gabo. And David moves into his
[1:01:01] kingdom. And he began to think about,
[1:01:04] you know, Jonathan and what great
[1:01:06] friends that they were. And he wanted to
[1:01:08] see if there was any of Jonathan's seed
[1:01:11] that was still alive. And he found out
[1:01:14] about this young man. And so he he sends
[1:01:17] a message and messengers that they would
[1:01:20] be able to go get him and invite him.
[1:01:23] Now remember, it was the common custom
[1:01:25] among kings of that day if there was any
[1:01:29] seed left of anybody that might
[1:01:32] potentially try to take their throne to
[1:01:35] kill them.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; So Mphibicheth really would have had a
[1:01:39] death penalty on him because he was a
[1:01:42] grandson of Saul. Well, I had a death
[1:01:45] penalty on me because I was a son of a
[1:01:48] fallen Adam. You had a death penalty on
[1:01:51] you because you was the son or a
[1:01:53] daughter of fallen man. Is that right?
[1:01:56] But you know what David done? He looked
[1:01:58] and he called it. I can imagine as
[1:02:01] Mphibicheth was called into this court
[1:02:04] that he wondered. He must have been
[1:02:06] nervous and anxious and thinking, "Oh my
[1:02:09] goodness, he's going to take my life."
[1:02:10] It was a common practice. He's going to
[1:02:12] take my life. He's afraid that I I will
[1:02:14] threaten his kingdom. I would never do
[1:02:16] that. My daddy loved him. So he didn't
[1:02:19] know. He did not know. But when he comes
[1:02:21] in and I just imagine myself, David
[1:02:24] being a man of great such per
[1:02:27] personification. David knew anger. He
[1:02:30] knew anxiety. He knew all kinds of
[1:02:32] emotions. You imagine when he saw
[1:02:34] Mphibicheth and the emotional tie in his
[1:02:37] heart to Jonathan so expressed itself on
[1:02:41] his face that Mphibicheth knew he had
[1:02:44] found favor in David's sight. Listen now
[1:02:49] in his sight. So the way that it was
[1:02:51] reflected off of his face. Now remember
[1:02:54] this is one of the scriptures in the
[1:02:56] book of Deuteronomy that Moses called
[1:02:58] the ministers to put on the children of
[1:03:01] Israel. And he told him to say this and
[1:03:04] put the name of the Lord on the children
[1:03:07] of Israel. May the Lord bless thee and
[1:03:09] keep thee. May the Lord cause his face
[1:03:12] and his countenance to shine upon thee.
[1:03:15] One of my favorite scriptures in all the
[1:03:17] Bible. For I figure if God can do that,
[1:03:19] everything else I have need of will be
[1:03:22] included in that one package. So David
[1:03:24] was able to reflect that and Mphibicheth
[1:03:27] looking on him and seeing in his eyes.
[1:03:31] Now keep this. There's something about
[1:03:34] eyes.
[1:03:35] Something about eyes. The first time
[1:03:38] eyes is mentioned in the Bible of course
[1:03:40] was in the in the book of Genesis and
[1:03:42] the Garden of Eden. Eyes. Eyes are such
[1:03:45] a powerful thing. And it's no wonder
[1:03:48] then that the Lord Jesus whenever he
[1:03:50] writes about his bride through the
[1:03:52] through the person of Solomon and the
[1:03:54] Song of Solomon that her eyes are
[1:03:57] mentioned over and over again. Now s the
[1:04:01] eyes are the inlet to the soul. So if
[1:04:04] your eye is single then it can tie into
[1:04:08] the purification of your heart, your
[1:04:10] spirit, your flesh, your soul before
[1:04:13] God. Those whose eyes are not single, by
[1:04:17] that I mean they're looking at one main
[1:04:20] goal in life. They have other things in
[1:04:23] life that they want, other things in
[1:04:25] life that they're going to do. But their
[1:04:27] main goal, remember the scripture uses
[1:04:30] this term, if your eye be single. So
[1:04:33] that is your main goal in life is to be
[1:04:37] what God ordains you to be then in your
[1:04:41] eyes, you project that image. And the
[1:04:43] Lord Jesus looks into your eyes. So when
[1:04:46] he looks into our eyes, what does he
[1:04:49] see? Does he see many different goals,
[1:04:52] many different desires, many different
[1:04:54] achievements, or does he see one main
[1:04:57] thing and then all the rest of them are
[1:05:00] prioritized according to the value of
[1:05:04] God's predestinated will? Was somebody
[1:05:06] going to say amen with me this morning?
[1:05:08] Now, to me, that's what the real
[1:05:10] believer should be. You agree with that?
[1:05:12] So, how that the Lord can be able to
[1:05:15] look at us and say that thou art fair,
[1:05:18] my love. Now notice she has moved into a
[1:05:20] special status with him that no one else
[1:05:25] ever had. And yet he knows along the
[1:05:28] journey that she will have slack times
[1:05:32] in her life. Maybe some of you sitting
[1:05:33] here today and you're finding yourself
[1:05:35] in kind of a a cold kind of place with
[1:05:38] the Lord. Maybe a place where you're not
[1:05:40] reading your Bible. you're not praying
[1:05:42] like you should and you found little
[1:05:44] things creeping back into your life that
[1:05:46] you got rid of years and years ago. And
[1:05:48] look, you know, if you find yourself
[1:05:50] there, it doesn't mean that the Lord
[1:05:52] Jesus is going to trash you. It doesn't
[1:05:54] mean that he's going to throw you on
[1:05:56] that trash heap of humanity and there's
[1:05:58] no mercy for you. He knew that we would
[1:06:01] be as human beings that we would go
[1:06:04] through ups and downs and ins and outs
[1:06:06] of life. But aren't you glad his love
[1:06:09] for us never changes?
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't mind telling you as human
[1:06:14] beings, we love one another more at
[1:06:16] times than we do at other times.
[1:06:18] Whenever we're kind of getting on one
[1:06:20] another's nerves or we mess up and and
[1:06:23] we look at one another and we sometimes
[1:06:25] don't have near as much grace for one
[1:06:27] another. And the church said, "But I'm
[1:06:30] so glad that the Lord can look farther
[1:06:32] than what I look and look farther than
[1:06:35] what you look and to be able to see when
[1:06:37] people are messing up big time." I dare
[1:06:40] say if you've been saved very long
[1:06:42] today, whether you're this is your home
[1:06:44] church or you're a visitor, I imagine
[1:06:47] most of us have messed up pretty bad at
[1:06:49] times in our lives, haven't we? It's
[1:06:51] what I figured. Yeah. But you see, he
[1:06:54] knew that she would do that and he knew
[1:06:57] that she would have this in her because
[1:07:00] she has split. She has a nature in her
[1:07:04] that is is divine. I love the way the
[1:07:06] prophet describes it in thirst in 1965
[1:07:10] and he says that people of the day where
[1:07:13] they are they find themselves living
[1:07:16] between two desires. So he describes it
[1:07:20] like a control tower and he said the
[1:07:22] things of the world will run in from the
[1:07:25] outside into the control tower and it
[1:07:28] will tell you you want this, you need
[1:07:30] that. There's a natural control tower
[1:07:33] and a spiritual one. For those that are
[1:07:35] truly born again, then they have a new
[1:07:38] captain in the control tower, which is
[1:07:40] the Holy Ghost. Now, the one in the
[1:07:43] body, it's still there. But the one in
[1:07:45] the soul is commanderin-chief, and he
[1:07:48] takes authority over the other one. Now,
[1:07:50] can you imagine? You're flying in and
[1:07:52] out of Atlanta, the world's most busiest
[1:07:54] airport. I've been in many of the major
[1:07:56] airports of the world, and you see them
[1:07:58] them guys up there and saying, "Wow,
[1:08:00] what a what a responsibility. They have
[1:08:02] this flight coming in, this one leaving,
[1:08:04] this one doing this, this one do that."
[1:08:06] Well, if you can imagine it, that's your
[1:08:08] soul.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; That's your humanity. So here's the
[1:08:12] control tower setting right out and
[1:08:14] they're not way back over three miles
[1:08:16] away. They're right there in the middle
[1:08:19] of all the action. So they're looking at
[1:08:21] radar. They're looking through the
[1:08:23] windows. They're seeing all these things
[1:08:24] that are going on. That's the way you
[1:08:26] live your human life every day. So in
[1:08:30] the control tower of your humanity is
[1:08:33] thirst and desires. you know, something
[1:08:35] that runs in on your body whenever
[1:08:37] you're hungry, whenever you're thirsty,
[1:08:40] when you need fellowship, when you need
[1:08:41] friendship. And there's things then that
[1:08:44] Satan will try to tap into that control
[1:08:46] tower that will get you to sin. And
[1:08:49] remember, whenever that happens, it's
[1:08:51] demons that have access the natural
[1:08:54] thirst inside of you as a human being.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; And Satan will then try to pull you over
[1:09:01] under demonic influence. Somebody said,
[1:09:03] "Amen."
[1:09:04] What was it that talked Eve to sinning
[1:09:07] in the very beginning? What was it? A
[1:09:10] fallen angel.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; A fallen angel talked her into sinning.
[1:09:16] What is it that talks you and I into
[1:09:18] falling short of the glory of God?
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Fallen angels again. And then they run
[1:09:24] in on what? Something weird and strange?
[1:09:27] Something outside of you? No, it's
[1:09:29] something that they use that's in you,
[1:09:32] which is your own thirst. And if the
[1:09:34] Holy Ghost is not in your soul, and the
[1:09:36] majority of humanity, it's not. Then
[1:09:38] they do whatever that thing wants. If
[1:09:42] they want to get drunk, they get drunk.
[1:09:43] If it says do whatever, that's exactly
[1:09:45] what they do. And the sad part about it
[1:09:47] is most of them do not have the power to
[1:09:50] be able to say no. Their conscience will
[1:09:53] hold them for so long. Message teaching
[1:09:56] will hold them for so long. But even the
[1:09:59] teaching of the message will not keep
[1:10:00] the power of sin out of your soul.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. That's exactly
[1:10:06] right. If that tpost is not down inside
[1:10:09] of your soul, you can know the Bible
[1:10:11] frontwards and backwards. You can quote
[1:10:13] so many quotes. It would be remarkable
[1:10:15] to hear them. But if you ain't got the
[1:10:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost and you're not
[1:10:19] sealed by the power of God, you'll never
[1:10:22] make the grade in this end time. Demon
[1:10:25] powers are streaming in every direction.
[1:10:27] As a matter of fact, the prophet tells
[1:10:29] us in 1961 that the lid has been took
[1:10:33] off of the cattle and demon powers are
[1:10:36] streaming in every direction. But I want
[1:10:39] to let the devil know this morning, not
[1:10:42] only are demon powers streaming in every
[1:10:44] direction, but the Holy Ghost is
[1:10:46] streaming in every direction. And the
[1:10:49] angels of God are also in every
[1:10:51] direction. As a matter of fact, they're
[1:10:54] right here in this building this
[1:10:56] morning. The angels of God are right
[1:10:58] here to minister to you, to nudge you,
[1:11:02] to encourage your faith, to help you
[1:11:05] come to your position.
[1:11:07] [Applause]
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Oh my. uh in in spite of her faults, in
[1:11:12] spite of her failures, he uses this term
[1:11:16] of the deepest endearment of how he
[1:11:19] feels about her in that he calls her my
[1:11:24] love.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; My love now my love what? So is she the
[1:11:30] only love that he has? No. God so loved
[1:11:33] the world cosmos that he gave his only
[1:11:36] begotten son. So God loves other than
[1:11:39] his bride, but she's the only one that
[1:11:41] he loves to this degree. He does not
[1:11:43] call the foolish virgin his love. He
[1:11:47] does not call the 144,000 his love. He
[1:11:51] calls the bride his love. My love. My
[1:11:56] love. So she actually becomes a
[1:11:58] personification
[1:12:00] of what he projected to her from his own
[1:12:04] heart before the foundation of the
[1:12:07] world. So what has she become? His love.
[1:12:11] My love. My love. There is no
[1:12:14] remembrance now of her follyies. There
[1:12:17] is no remembrance of her shortcomings.
[1:12:20] Only God can do this.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; He does not cherish. Think of it. He
[1:12:25] does not cherish the thought of our
[1:12:27] failures. As a matter of fact, he wants
[1:12:29] to put it as far from him as he can. And
[1:12:34] he knew that we would need this. And
[1:12:36] this is why John said, "Little children,
[1:12:38] I write unto you that you sin not. But
[1:12:40] if any man sin, we have an advocate with
[1:12:42] the father, which is Jesus Christ the
[1:12:44] righteous, who is a perpetuation of our
[1:12:47] sins, and not ours only, but the sins of
[1:12:50] the whole world."
[1:12:51] Now you imagine John is not writing to
[1:12:53] the to the dead church people. He's not
[1:12:56] writing to people that's not even saved.
[1:12:58] He's writing to children of God. Why?
[1:13:01] Because you have been changed from a
[1:13:03] cocker and you've got a wheat heart
[1:13:06] inside your soul, but your outside is
[1:13:09] still cocker. And don't you never trust
[1:13:12] it.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; The day you start trusting your flesh,
[1:13:17] you're defeated.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. It'll lie to you.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; It'll talk you into things.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, it will. It'll call you call It'll
[1:13:27] absolutely cause you to do terrible
[1:13:30] things. It will absolutely do it. It's
[1:13:32] just, you know, it's just the way the
[1:13:34] flesh is. It's unregenerate. It don't
[1:13:36] like God.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; The flesh don't like hard preaching.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; The flesh don't like laying aside this
[1:13:44] and that and the other. The flesh wants
[1:13:45] to be pampered and babyed. The flesh
[1:13:48] loves entertainment.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Preached by the Donnie.
[1:13:54] [Applause]
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Notice this. In the Ephesians church
[1:13:57] age, the true church of Jesus Christ,
[1:13:58] the bride, is likened to pure gold. Her
[1:14:02] righteousness is his righteousness. Her
[1:14:06] attributes are his own glorious
[1:14:08] attributes. Her identity is found in
[1:14:11] him. Friends, if we're not found in him
[1:14:13] today, we are no better than any other
[1:14:16] denomination.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; If we are not in Christ Jesus, oh,
[1:14:20] brother Donnie, how can I know that I'm
[1:14:21] there? For by one spirit, we are all
[1:14:24] baptized into that one body. And if
[1:14:27] you're baptized into that body, you
[1:14:29] cannot have the Holy Ghost and deny one
[1:14:31] of God's words.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; That Holy Ghost in you will say amen to
[1:14:35] the word. Even though your flesh may
[1:14:37] say, "Oo, that hurt. Oh, that hurt. Oh,
[1:14:39] that hurt." But your soul will say,
[1:14:41] "Amen, Lord."
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Notice her identity
[1:14:46] is found in him. What he is, she is to
[1:14:50] reflect. Glory. Oh my. She is to what he
[1:14:54] has, she is to manifest. There is no
[1:14:57] fault in her.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; There's people sitting in this building
[1:15:06] today who match this.
[1:15:09] They are thoughtless.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; But they're the biggest messer uppers
[1:15:17] you ever seen in your life.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; And they still fight temper and they
[1:15:23] still fight this and that and the other.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Well, you say you're confusing me. Well,
[1:15:28] good.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Hope confusion then help you get
[1:15:31] straight out.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Come on. When are we ever going to come
[1:15:34] to a spot and realize it is not us that
[1:15:36] can produce his friends. If we don't get
[1:15:39] to the Lord Jesus and get this, we are
[1:15:42] not going in a rapture.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; You can come to this church. You can go
[1:15:46] wherever you go to church and be as
[1:15:48] faithful as you can be. If you don't get
[1:15:50] this, you miss it.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Don't you understand? You miss it? Oh, I
[1:15:55] wish I could get it to the to the people
[1:15:57] in an urgency of the hour and realize
[1:16:00] this is bride material we're talking
[1:16:03] about. Not just coming to church, not
[1:16:05] just listening to tapes, all that's
[1:16:07] good. But if you don't cross that line
[1:16:09] to where you become this, you are not
[1:16:12] going in the rapture. You understand
[1:16:14] where you're headed? Straight for the
[1:16:17] tribulation period. I mean, the bride is
[1:16:20] gone. All hell is going to break loose
[1:16:23] on this earth like it has never been
[1:16:25] before. Please children, stop playing
[1:16:27] church.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Please stop sitting around and while I
[1:16:31] do this and I do that. When are we going
[1:16:34] to come to a spot till we realize this
[1:16:36] is a matter of life and death?
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:47] She is all glorious within and without
[1:16:49] from beginning to ending.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; She is the work of her Lord and all his
[1:16:56] works are perfect. In fact, in her is
[1:16:59] summed up and manifested the eternal
[1:17:03] wisdom and purpose of God. Not in
[1:17:07] angels, not in cherubams, not in
[1:17:09] saraphims and zoons and all the the
[1:17:12] stars and the moon and the sun. In the
[1:17:14] bride,
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; is summed up and manifested the entire
[1:17:19] purpose of God.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; How can one fathom it? How can one
[1:17:24] understand it? Though we cannot do that,
[1:17:27] we can accept it by faith.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; I accept it this morning.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; For God hath spoken it.
[1:17:36] Now watch in in this verse number eight.
[1:17:41] Come with me from Lebanon.
[1:17:45] Now this is the same Lebanon actually
[1:17:47] that Israel is fighting on their
[1:17:49] northern border where they've just been
[1:17:51] fighting for the last two years on a
[1:17:54] radical group called Hezbollah. It's the
[1:17:57] same Lebanon
[1:17:59] and their enemies are still there.
[1:18:02] As a matter of fact, according to some
[1:18:05] of the intelligence that they're
[1:18:06] getting, they're figuring that once they
[1:18:08] get their hostages back and all the wars
[1:18:11] resolved in Gaza that Hezbollah is going
[1:18:14] to attack again. Well, when I look at
[1:18:17] that, I realize that that Lebanon is
[1:18:19] sort of like us.
[1:18:22] Now remember from where the Shulamite
[1:18:24] lived from the place of Shunam and many
[1:18:27] of you Bible readers probably already
[1:18:29] know that the word Shulamite is the
[1:18:31] feminist form of Solomon.
[1:18:34] Feminist form of Solomon.
[1:18:37] So Solomon Caesar is in the north
[1:18:40] country. So you go into Galilee up where
[1:18:42] the Lake Guinness or Lake Galilee is.
[1:18:44] And then you keep going north and you
[1:18:46] got the Golan Heights. We stood there a
[1:18:48] few years ago right up on the Golan. And
[1:18:50] you look down over the brim of the Golan
[1:18:52] Heights and there's the Sea of Galilee.
[1:18:54] And the Syrians a few years ago was up
[1:18:56] on the Golan and they were shooting
[1:18:58] rockets and missiles and all kinds of
[1:19:00] things down on the saints of God in
[1:19:02] their promised land in the land of
[1:19:04] Galilee because they held the high
[1:19:07] ground. And this is why Israel said, "We
[1:19:10] need the Golan. We need some of you need
[1:19:13] the Golan of your life today." Yes.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to notice these terms of
[1:19:19] what Solomon said. Come with me from
[1:19:22] Lebanon, my spouse. Now, she enters in
[1:19:26] to a new relationship that he had not
[1:19:29] used before. And it was, my love was
[1:19:32] wonderful, but now he calls her
[1:19:34] something different. She is now not just
[1:19:37] an engaged bride, betrod, but she is now
[1:19:41] his wife.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Now, think of it. Come with me from
[1:19:45] Lebanon, my spouse. Come with me from
[1:19:47] Lebanon. Notice how many times he's
[1:19:49] repeating these things. Look from the
[1:19:52] top of Aana. Top of Aana. From the top
[1:19:56] of Shener and Hermon. Now, for those of
[1:20:00] you that know the topography of Israel,
[1:20:02] you know that this is the upper
[1:20:04] elevations of the entirety of the nation
[1:20:07] of Israel. Mount Hermon can have snow up
[1:20:10] on it. It does every year. They have ski
[1:20:13] resorts up on Mount Hermon. Remember
[1:20:14] David talking about snow. And yet down
[1:20:17] in the lower part of it, of course, it's
[1:20:19] desert. But some of these are mountains
[1:20:22] and they're they're craggy. And there
[1:20:24] they have wild beast. They have
[1:20:26] leopards. They have lions. They have all
[1:20:30] kinds of things. And this is near the
[1:20:32] homeland of where the Shunomite was born
[1:20:35] and raised. So this is the country where
[1:20:38] she comes from. And notice the
[1:20:41] bridegroom is he is calling her away
[1:20:45] from her homeland into another home.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse,
[1:20:52] and with me from Lebanon. Look from the
[1:20:55] top of Aa and from the top of Shener and
[1:21:01] Hermon from the lion's Oh my goodness.
[1:21:05] from the lion's dens and from the
[1:21:08] mountains of the leopards. Now, this is
[1:21:11] where she's from. This is the place she
[1:21:15] had her nativity at. But he's calling
[1:21:18] her now. She's entered in to the spouse
[1:21:21] state. She is his love. She is his
[1:21:24] spouse. She has now been received in the
[1:21:28] marriage covenant. And now he's giving
[1:21:31] her, hallelujah, the marriage call. Come
[1:21:35] with me, my spouse. But notice, I want
[1:21:38] you to go up now, bride, and I want you
[1:21:40] to look from Shener, from her ama, and
[1:21:44] from Hermon, from the lion's dens. You
[1:21:48] mean every bride member is going to have
[1:21:51] lion's dens in their lives? How many has
[1:21:53] them in your life? Some of y'all
[1:21:55] probably so much. That's your living
[1:21:57] room, ain't it? Your living room, your
[1:21:58] kitchen, your bathroom, your closet. It
[1:22:00] seem like you live in the lion's den.
[1:22:02] Well, maybe it's time for you to come
[1:22:04] out of there today. Now, I want you to
[1:22:06] notice what he said from the lion's
[1:22:09] dens. So, you see the whole idea is the
[1:22:12] Shulamite, which was a virgin girl. And
[1:22:15] whenever Solomon, we're taught by
[1:22:17] history that he was in the northern part
[1:22:18] of his kingdom and whenever he came
[1:22:20] through that he saw her and he was
[1:22:23] overwhelmed by her. Absolutely
[1:22:25] overwhelmed. Now, remember, he can marry
[1:22:27] any woman that wasn't married in his
[1:22:29] kingdom. He can marry king's daughters.
[1:22:31] He can marry princesses. He can marry
[1:22:33] all kinds of people. But whenever he saw
[1:22:36] this Shulamite, she so smit his heart. I
[1:22:39] mean, she smoteed him so much. She took
[1:22:43] his breath.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Don't you understand? You took his
[1:22:48] breath.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; On Mount Calvary.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; You took his breath.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:22:58] He was so smitten by you.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; He could not leave you where you were
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; in the lion's dens. Hallelujah.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; And in the leopard's caves.
[1:23:10] Oh my. So this is where she's from. In
[1:23:14] these crazy outcrops of this mountainous
[1:23:17] type of area. Those of you that have
[1:23:19] never been there, it's quite a place to
[1:23:20] see it. Very inhospitable scenes. And
[1:23:24] this is where she comes from. But he's
[1:23:26] calling her to where? Jerusalem.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Now remember the city of the king, King
[1:23:33] Solomon was Jerusalem.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; So he is calling her from Hermon, from
[1:23:40] Amana, calling her from Shener and from
[1:23:43] these other places of the Golan to where
[1:23:46] there's lion's dens and leopards and all
[1:23:48] this sort of thing. He's saying, "Come
[1:23:51] away, my love."
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come away with me my love.
[1:23:56] You imagine her thinking this poor
[1:23:58] country girl and then she said about
[1:24:00] herself I am black but clumbling. Now to
[1:24:03] them at that time a fair skinned woman
[1:24:05] was the most beautiful women. And those
[1:24:07] women which were whitish type skin it
[1:24:10] was a sign that they didn't get out and
[1:24:11] work in the sun. So they were rich
[1:24:13] ladies of course. So they stayed in the
[1:24:15] house. But this woman she had the look
[1:24:18] about her that she'd been in the
[1:24:19] presence of the sun. I hope we have the
[1:24:22] look about us that we've been in the
[1:24:23] presence of the son of man.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. The world may laugh at us and make
[1:24:28] fun. Well, let them do whatever they
[1:24:29] want to do. I really don't care. As long
[1:24:31] as I hear this call right here, let them
[1:24:33] call me what they will. But one of these
[1:24:36] days when you come looking for me, don't
[1:24:38] come looking very far because call me, I
[1:24:40] won't be here. I'll be gone.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:46] Oh, notice now the chener, the Hermmon,
[1:24:49] the ama. A region of rocks and mountains
[1:24:52] and steep crevices. Very dangerous place
[1:24:55] to live.
[1:24:57] Sounds like my everyday walk with God.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Sounds like your everyday walk with God.
[1:25:03] You got craggy spots and steep places
[1:25:05] and lion's dens as in plural. So, we're
[1:25:08] not talking about a little house cat
[1:25:10] about that big meow meow. If that's all
[1:25:14] your battles are, you need to join a
[1:25:15] real army. But the real bride of Christ,
[1:25:18] we don't have little house cats and and
[1:25:20] the little cushions over here somewhere.
[1:25:22] I'm talking about we face real lions in
[1:25:25] the battle we're in. We face real
[1:25:28] leopards. And remember, the leopard in
[1:25:29] the Bible is a power. Remember the
[1:25:31] vision that Daniel saw about a leopard.
[1:25:33] Of course, it represented an Old
[1:25:34] Testament uh kingdom that was coming up.
[1:25:36] Leopards, lions, those things are
[1:25:38] powers. And this shows what we are
[1:25:40] against today in this building. A great
[1:25:43] warfare is going on. The angels of God
[1:25:46] are here. But guess what? There's also
[1:25:48] another side. Demons are all in this
[1:25:51] place this morning. They're trying to
[1:25:53] anoint your sinking. They're trying to
[1:25:55] keep you away from the promise of God.
[1:25:57] If you're sick, they want to block you
[1:25:59] off from your healing. If you're bound
[1:26:01] with besetting sins in your life, they
[1:26:04] want to block you all from your
[1:26:05] deliverance. But the angels of God are
[1:26:08] standing by your pews and they're trying
[1:26:10] to anoint your faith. And the prophet
[1:26:13] says at one time in a discernment, he
[1:26:15] said, "Them demons are calling to one
[1:26:17] another and they're saying, can't you
[1:26:20] hear it?" He said, "Keep them from
[1:26:22] believing. Keep them from believing." He
[1:26:26] said, "But faith is accumulating." And
[1:26:29] he said, "The battle is going to go and
[1:26:31] it will be determined by the way you
[1:26:34] look at it." So, how you going to look
[1:26:36] at this service today? Are you going to
[1:26:38] look at it? Well, I like lion's dens and
[1:26:40] I like leopard caves and I like living a
[1:26:43] dangerous type of life. My Lord Jesus is
[1:26:46] here calling for a bride to get her
[1:26:49] ready to say, "Come away, my love. Come
[1:26:52] out of this earth." Don't you
[1:26:53] understand, friend? Every day we live
[1:26:56] here in this earth, it's becoming more
[1:26:59] unfit for the bride to live in. Men
[1:27:02] don't know if they're men. Women don't
[1:27:04] know if they're women. And oh my, the
[1:27:06] world is creeping into the church. The
[1:27:09] world is creeping into our message home.
[1:27:12] Don't anybody want an oldfashioned Holy
[1:27:14] Ghost revival. I ain't talking about
[1:27:16] just running and jumping. I'm talking
[1:27:19] about people getting saved and
[1:27:21] sanctified and filled with the Holy
[1:27:23] Ghost. Sure, I believe in jumping. But
[1:27:26] just make sure you live as high as you
[1:27:28] jump.
[1:27:39] So it says, "My love,
[1:27:43] my spouse,
[1:27:46] how would you like to leave the lion's
[1:27:48] den?
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; How would you like to live Trump's
[1:27:53] world?
[1:27:56] How would you like to leave the
[1:27:57] Democrats world? How would you like to
[1:27:59] leave the socialists and the communists
[1:28:02] and
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know some of you, you're so tied
[1:28:06] up in politics. I would to God you get
[1:28:08] that tied up in the word of God for the
[1:28:09] hour.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for the last Trump. All
[1:28:18] right. But it's not the one in the White
[1:28:20] House.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Well, brother Donn,
[1:28:24] what are you? I ain't neither one. and I
[1:28:25] ain't never voted in my life. And I
[1:28:27] don't want to ruin my record now by
[1:28:28] starting. But I know one thing, God's
[1:28:30] prophet said, "The devil controls both
[1:28:32] sides of politics." So whether you're a
[1:28:34] Democrat or Republican or an independent
[1:28:37] or whatever you are, I'm telling you one
[1:28:39] thing, you better be so caught up in the
[1:28:41] Lord Jesus. And if your party goes off
[1:28:43] into the world, you better have enough
[1:28:45] sense to get out of there and say, "God,
[1:28:47] I don't want to be identified in that
[1:28:48] trashy mess no more. I want to leave
[1:28:51] these Craigs. I want to leave these
[1:28:52] lions dens." Come on, children. We're
[1:28:55] not waiting for this man to come. Oh,
[1:28:57] brother Donnie, we need a revival. We
[1:28:59] need to let this Pentecostal guy, this
[1:29:01] Baptist guy, what are you talking about?
[1:29:02] The bride don't feed on Pentecostal.
[1:29:05] The bride don't feed on Pentecostalism.
[1:29:08] The bride can feed only on the revealed
[1:29:11] word of this end time. Does emotion come
[1:29:14] with it? Yes, it does. Does joy come
[1:29:16] with it? Yes, it does. But it will not
[1:29:19] compromise on the word of this hour. If
[1:29:21] the word of Pentecost would produce a
[1:29:23] rapture, how come they didn't go years
[1:29:26] ago? If the Baptist word would produce a
[1:29:28] rapture, it won't. And it didn't, and it
[1:29:31] will not today. But we needed an end
[1:29:33] time message. Hallelujah. And what did
[1:29:36] God send? Behold, I send unto you,
[1:29:40] Elijah the prophet, and he shall turn
[1:29:42] the hearts of the children, Amen, to the
[1:29:45] fathers, and the hearts of the children
[1:29:47] back to their fathers again. We have
[1:29:50] arrived.
[1:29:52] We are here, friend. Oh my. Look around
[1:29:56] at your Hermon. Look around at your AMA.
[1:29:59] Cuz today may be the last day you'll
[1:30:03] ever see a lion's den.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; If it ain't today, it might be tomorrow.
[1:30:08] If it ain't tomorrow, it might be next
[1:30:10] week. But one of these days, you'll
[1:30:13] never see another lion's den again.
[1:30:26] Come,
[1:30:28] oh my tough.
[1:30:31] So Christ calls men from their present
[1:30:35] scenes,
[1:30:36] the present scenes
[1:30:39] of where they currently are. Maybe
[1:30:41] you're not in a good spot today. Let the
[1:30:44] voice of God call you out of where you
[1:30:46] are. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; He's calling us away from our first
[1:30:51] condition.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Of our natural birth, calling us from
[1:30:56] stony places
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; and calling us out of the presence of
[1:31:00] bride killers.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Come on. That's what lions are. They're
[1:31:05] bride killers.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Leopards are bride killers.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; But let me just let the devil know
[1:31:11] today, we're devil killers.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are giant killers. Come
[1:31:18] on, somebody. We're pornography killers.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; We're cancer killers. Amen. Ungodly
[1:31:26] worldliness killers. That's who we are.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Remember, our armory is not just a
[1:31:32] museum that has a lot of Bible stories
[1:31:35] in it. But in our armory is current
[1:31:38] events that are going on. In our armory,
[1:31:41] we have testimonies of last week and
[1:31:44] week before last that our God is still
[1:31:47] working miracles and confirming his word
[1:31:50] like never before. I love to point back
[1:31:52] to David. I love to point back to
[1:31:55] Samson. But let me tell you, it's been
[1:31:57] even more recent than that that I've
[1:32:00] seen the Lord Jesus do the same thing
[1:32:02] he's always done. I don't want a dead
[1:32:05] God. I don't want a God that used to do,
[1:32:07] used to do, used to do. I need a God
[1:32:10] that still does it. I need a God that
[1:32:13] still saves the lost, that still
[1:32:15] sanctifies, that still fills with the
[1:32:17] Holy Ghost.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; You see, the believer's life,
[1:32:27] the believer's life is a daily coming
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; from Lebanon.
[1:32:36] This is why Paul could say that I die.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; What was that? His old nature, his old
[1:32:44] sinful nature? No, it was this he was
[1:32:46] left in.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Notice Jesus in Luke 9:23. And he said
[1:32:51] to them all, "If any man will come after
[1:32:53] me, let him deny himself
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; and take up his cross."
[1:33:00] I'm sure you've read the scripture
[1:33:02] enough to know that Jesus spoke more
[1:33:03] about your cross
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; than he did his own.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't tell you to take up his
[1:33:10] cross,
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; but yours.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; But you see, Leodysia
[1:33:16] wants you to fully focus on what they
[1:33:18] say is his cross.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; They point to the cross. They sing about
[1:33:23] the cross. They teach about the cross.
[1:33:25] They dream about the cross. They make
[1:33:26] movies about the cross. The cross. The
[1:33:28] cross. the cross. But how many of them
[1:33:30] tell their people they also have a
[1:33:32] cross?
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; But it's like, well, if Jesus bore it,
[1:33:36] then I don't need to do anything else.
[1:33:37] That's not what Jesus himself said.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; You're going to have a cross to bear.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; You see, believers redeemed from this
[1:33:47] present evil world, they take heed
[1:33:52] so that they don't get caught in
[1:33:54] bondage.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Again.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Read with me if you would in
[1:33:59] Galatians 5:1.
[1:34:01] Standf fast therefore in the liberty
[1:34:04] wherewith Christ has made us free and be
[1:34:09] not entangled
[1:34:11] again with the yoke of bondage.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; with the yoke of bondage. So a person
[1:34:22] could be free from alcohol and drugs or
[1:34:26] free from lying, adultery, whatever
[1:34:29] their vices were.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; And pick up some of the same stuff.
[1:34:35] Still coming to church.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Sitting in the house of God, clapping
[1:34:38] their hands, worshiping the Lord.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; I must have had a disconnect.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:34:50] Amen.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; If this was not possible, Paul would
[1:34:54] have never wasted time by putting it in
[1:34:56] the scripture.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Stand fast, therefore, in the liberty
[1:35:00] where with Christ has made us free and
[1:35:02] be not entangled again. What a terrible
[1:35:05] thing that a person could be set free
[1:35:10] and then become entangled
[1:35:13] again
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; by the exact same thing.
[1:35:20] be not entangled again with the yoke
[1:35:23] of bondage. Second Peter 2:20. For if
[1:35:26] after they have escape the pollutions of
[1:35:28] the world through the knowledge of the
[1:35:30] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are
[1:35:32] again
[1:35:34] entangled therein and overcome. That's
[1:35:37] one thing to be, you know, get your
[1:35:38] hands tied up or your feet tied up and
[1:35:41] you're able to break loose and get away.
[1:35:44] But the longer you stay on
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; and the more you play with it,
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; And the more you feel like you've got it
[1:35:50] under control,
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; then it's pulling you into its
[1:35:54] captivity.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; And then you become overcome.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Hands are tied, feet are tied. You no
[1:36:03] longer want to go to church.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Your ears are tied. Now you started
[1:36:08] listening to country music or jazz or
[1:36:09] blues or R&B or whatever more. And you
[1:36:12] no longer love Amazing Grace. How sweet
[1:36:14] the sound. You You'd rather hang around
[1:36:16] some of your buddies at work than hang
[1:36:17] around Holy Ghost fil saints. Preach,
[1:36:19] Brother Donnie.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; You know what's happening to you? You're
[1:36:22] becoming entangled again and it wants to
[1:36:25] lead you to bondage.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Now notice what happens. The latter end
[1:36:34] is worse with them
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; than the beginning. Now friends, how
[1:36:39] many people have we seen around our
[1:36:41] message that have fulfilled this
[1:36:43] scripture?
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of scriptures in the Bible
[1:36:46] I have no desire to fulfill.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; These two I read you are two of them.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Anybody here want to
[1:36:54] fulfill these?
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; It's your choice.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; You see, it is the character of our
[1:37:03] journey. So the journey from Lebanon and
[1:37:06] the snowcapped mountain of Hermon
[1:37:10] which is so different than the Galilee
[1:37:13] so different from Jerusalem.
[1:37:17] This is where we are. Rugged paths
[1:37:21] steep precipice
[1:37:23] crevices craggy. Any of you that's ever
[1:37:26] been in some of my brothers here from
[1:37:28] Arizona I see here today and I've hunted
[1:37:30] with them before and my some in places
[1:37:32] where we've been together and hunting. I
[1:37:33] mean, you've got to watch every move. It
[1:37:35] ain't like a green pasture field of East
[1:37:38] Tennessee where you're out there walking
[1:37:39] and the most dangerous thing you run
[1:37:41] into is a copperhead.
[1:37:43] That can be pretty dangerous, can't it?
[1:37:45] But whenever one may one move, you can
[1:37:48] fall hundreds and hundreds of feet. You
[1:37:50] understand? This is where we are. It's
[1:37:52] like we're climbing down a craggy
[1:37:54] prefaces and we're coming down into a
[1:37:56] spot in one mismove, one misstep, you
[1:38:00] can fall for hundreds and hundreds of
[1:38:02] feet.
[1:38:07] Ferocious animals all around you.
[1:38:13] Dogs,
[1:38:14] two-legged ones.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:38:20] The Bible describes them in the book of
[1:38:22] Peter and also in the book of
[1:38:24] Revelation.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Dogs.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; You know what that Greek word is? A male
[1:38:29] prostitute.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; A male pervert.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; We're surrounded by dogs.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And perversion.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Well, I realize YouTube's already
[1:38:42] flagged us several times. They'll
[1:38:43] probably eventually take us off. That's
[1:38:45] all right. I'd rather stand for the
[1:38:47] truth. Let my voice ring down for
[1:38:49] eternity than compromise.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; You see, it's a picture of the passage
[1:38:58] of a believer from their nativity into
[1:39:02] their destiny
[1:39:04] or where we're going. So, manifold
[1:39:05] temptations mingled with heaviness and
[1:39:09] sadness. Oh my. the lust of the flesh,
[1:39:13] lusting against the spirit, and the
[1:39:15] spirit combating against the flesh.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; And yet all along we're hearing his
[1:39:21] call.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Come away, my love.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; I'm coming, Jesus.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; I'm coming. Yes,
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; you imagine as here we are and we've
[1:39:35] heard the bridegroom's call. Brother
[1:39:38] Joel, we're heading down this steep
[1:39:40] place where we didn't realize how bad it
[1:39:42] was until his light illuminated the
[1:39:44] past. We didn't know how much darkness
[1:39:46] we were in.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; And now as we're heading toward him, it
[1:39:51] seems so obscure, such darkness all
[1:39:53] around us. And our hearts can become
[1:39:55] gripped with fear if we're not careful.
[1:40:00] And the most difficult part of the
[1:40:02] journey at times can be when the path is
[1:40:05] so narrow. There isn't room for you and
[1:40:08] your mother and your father and your
[1:40:10] brother and your uncle and your aunt and
[1:40:12] your pastor and the deacons to all walk
[1:40:14] side by side.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; But it's so narrow.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; There's only room for you.
[1:40:25] And oh yeah, the most important one,
[1:40:28] Jesus.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Anybody been there before when it was so
[1:40:35] narrow
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; and so frightening
[1:40:38] and you look for your mama and she ain't
[1:40:40] there? You look for your daddy. You look
[1:40:41] for your best friend and it seems like
[1:40:43] nobody can help you.
[1:40:48] But I want you to notice that when
[1:40:50] they're in this journey, there's great
[1:40:51] comfort and great aid. Notice how he
[1:40:54] says this. Chapter 4:8, "Come with me."
[1:41:00] There it is. There it is. The three
[1:41:04] words.
[1:41:05] Come with me from Lebanon. You mean to
[1:41:12] tell me
[1:41:14] he left Jerusalem?
[1:41:17] He left Jerusalem to come and escort me.
[1:41:23] out of this hell that I'm in every day
[1:41:25] of my life.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Notice the invitation. He's inviting you
[1:41:33] to come as him. It's not you
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; come on
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; inviting him.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; It's him inviting you.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse.
[1:41:47] With me from Lebanon. Look from the top
[1:41:49] of a mana. from the top of Shener and
[1:41:52] Hermon from the lion's dens and from the
[1:41:54] mountains of the leopards. Oh, these two
[1:41:57] precious words with me. With me. I don't
[1:42:03] care what you're going through today,
[1:42:04] friend. How low it is, how dark it is.
[1:42:07] If you're a son or daughter of God, the
[1:42:09] Lord Jesus will never leave you alone.
[1:42:12] And you know, as well as I know,
[1:42:14] sometimes children of God getting some
[1:42:15] of the biggest message. And a lot of
[1:42:17] them are self-created. We do it oursel
[1:42:19] out of our own stupidity and ignorance.
[1:42:22] And how in the world the Lord would ever
[1:42:24] love us in spite of all of our
[1:42:26] ignorance, it's a mystery to me. But he
[1:42:28] still does. And I'm so glad that he
[1:42:30] does. I'm telling you one thing. If God
[1:42:32] had to have a perfect preacher, he'd
[1:42:34] have never called me because I'm faulty.
[1:42:37] I'm flawed. I fall short of the glory of
[1:42:39] God. But there's one thing about it. If
[1:42:41] I fall down flat in my face, I'm going
[1:42:43] to get back up again and I'm going to
[1:42:45] dust myself off and I'm going to say,
[1:42:48] "Devil, you ain't doing it to me again.
[1:42:50] I'm going to learn by that mistake. I'm
[1:42:52] going to get back up. Come on, devil.
[1:42:54] You want to fight? Let's do it again."
[1:42:56] Why? Cuz Jesus still loved me. If you're
[1:42:59] there today and you got your nose all
[1:43:01] blooded up and your mouth all mashed,
[1:43:03] let me tell you, our beloved Lord Jesus
[1:43:06] is standing there by your lion den. He's
[1:43:09] there in them craggy mountains where the
[1:43:11] leopards are snarling all around you and
[1:43:14] your hairs are sticking up on your arm.
[1:43:16] But let me tell you, we have got another
[1:43:18] noise. I hear it. It's the shout of the
[1:43:21] king that's in our camp. We've got a
[1:43:24] shout among us that says, "Leeper, take
[1:43:26] your hand off of my daughter. Lion, take
[1:43:29] your hand off of my son. You cannot have
[1:43:33] them. They belong to me.
[1:43:40] Oh my.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; His support
[1:43:47] all the way through in his everlasting
[1:43:50] presence
[1:43:51] that will never leave us. Hebrews 13:5,
[1:43:55] "Let your conversation be without
[1:43:57] covetousness, and be content with such
[1:43:59] things as you have, for he hath said, I
[1:44:04] will never leave thee. Amen.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Nor forsake thee.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad?
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't we be in a mess today if he
[1:44:14] said, "Now, I will never leave you as
[1:44:16] long as you're doing everything I want.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; I'll never leave you as long as you're
[1:44:21] keeping every word of mine. But if you
[1:44:22] ever mess up, you're on your own."
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Thank God. He's so merciful.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Thank God. Look where we are, friend.
[1:44:30] The world has never been where we are.
[1:44:32] Our nation has never been where we are.
[1:44:34] The governments of the world have never
[1:44:36] been where we are. I'm so glad he hasn't
[1:44:38] left us here alone. We don't have to try
[1:44:40] to figure out a way to get out of here.
[1:44:42] He's done got the way made. It's called
[1:44:44] a rapture.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Let's read here in Psalm 27:1. Remember
[1:44:50] when the prophet preaches the rapture,
[1:44:53] he uses this for a background.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Not 1 Corinthians 15, not 1
[1:45:00] Thessalonians 4:16.
[1:45:03] Nothing about the resurrection.
[1:45:06] Nothing about Matthew 24. Nothing about
[1:45:09] Luke 21.
[1:45:11] Nothing about the coming of the Lord. Or
[1:45:15] so it would seem.
[1:45:17] But instead, he reads Psalm 27:1
[1:45:21] for a background for the rapture. Now,
[1:45:24] what is a background? Well, right here
[1:45:26] is what you're seeing right now. This is
[1:45:28] a background.
[1:45:30] So there's plants, there's wall panels,
[1:45:32] there's instruments, there's trim on the
[1:45:35] wall. That's the background. Hopefully
[1:45:37] y'all ain't focusing on the background
[1:45:38] the whole time, are you?
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; You're here to hear the word, right?
[1:45:42] Sing worship and all that. But yet, that
[1:45:44] is very important. Now, what if we had,
[1:45:47] you know, just all kinds of weird,
[1:45:48] dirty, filthy stuff up there? You know,
[1:45:50] I'm not talking about sinful stuff. I'm
[1:45:52] just talking about the wall is black and
[1:45:53] and just smud everywhere. And it'd be so
[1:45:56] distracting. But it is a background. A
[1:46:00] background. Whenever we laid it out, we
[1:46:01] tried to figure it out what would be,
[1:46:03] you know, would look nice and what would
[1:46:05] be pairs. I like pairs. I like
[1:46:06] symmetric. So we tried to look at that
[1:46:08] and divide the panels and all that. And
[1:46:11] my wife Carol told me we had had a lot
[1:46:13] of it done. She said, "Donnie, there's
[1:46:14] something missing." I said, "Well, what
[1:46:16] is it?" She said, "You've only got one
[1:46:17] door on that side, but there ain't no
[1:46:19] door here." So, Brother Dave Swanson,
[1:46:22] the brother that sang a while ago, he
[1:46:24] replicated this door. Now, this door is
[1:46:26] like a lot of churches. It don't go
[1:46:28] anywhere.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; It won't open. It won't go anywhere. So,
[1:46:33] if a fire breaks out, don't try to go
[1:46:35] out that door cuz you ain't want to get
[1:46:37] out cuz it don't lead anywhere. It looks
[1:46:39] just like a door. It's the same size as
[1:46:42] that door. He even painted the seam
[1:46:44] around it black so it would look like a
[1:46:46] door, but it ain't a door. I know you
[1:46:48] think it's a door, but it ain't a door.
[1:46:50] Because if it's a true door, it'll go
[1:46:52] somewhere. What is all of this? a
[1:46:55] background. So there is a background for
[1:46:58] the rapture
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; and this is it. A psalm of David.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; The Lord is my light
[1:47:07] and my salvation.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; Whom shall I fear?
[1:47:12] The Lord is the strength of my life. Of
[1:47:14] whom shall I be afraid?
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Now I want you to notice just in one
[1:47:18] verse he's used the word fear and
[1:47:22] afraid.
[1:47:24] So this is the background for the main
[1:47:27] thing. So what's going to be in the
[1:47:29] background? Events, things happening
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; that are going to cause fear.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Verse two. When the wicked,
[1:47:40] even mine enemies and my foes
[1:47:44] background for the rapture came upon me
[1:47:47] to eat out my flesh.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Lions, leopards, man-eing animals.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; They stumbled and fell.
[1:48:00] Though a host
[1:48:02] should encamp against me, a host
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; against one man.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; A host the background for the rapture.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Now, was this a mistake? It was
[1:48:17] prophetic.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was exactly the passages,
[1:48:20] brother Rob, that we needed for the
[1:48:22] background of the rapture. Listen,
[1:48:24] little bride. This is what it's going to
[1:48:26] be in the hour before we go home.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; All the leopards and the lions and the
[1:48:32] onslaught here and there and the other.
[1:48:34] But remember, even in the background,
[1:48:36] there is victory for the people of God.
[1:48:39] Amen.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; When the wicked, even mine enemies, and
[1:48:42] my foes, came up to me to eat up my
[1:48:44] flesh, they stumbled and fell.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; I didn't. They did.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Though in host should encamp against me,
[1:48:54] my heart shall not fear.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; Though war,
[1:48:59] wow.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; My look at fear and afraid and enemies
[1:49:04] and and all of that war. And what is
[1:49:06] this background for the rapture? I'm not
[1:49:10] here to scare you today. I'm just here
[1:49:12] to tell you, get your armor on.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; We're not going to a picnic. We done had
[1:49:16] that the other night. We're in a battle.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. And you go to looking
[1:49:21] in your pack. Some of our brothers and
[1:49:22] and people here in the church was in the
[1:49:24] military and they could tell you much
[1:49:26] more about it than I could. But let me
[1:49:27] describe your military pack. In your
[1:49:30] military pack, you've got the word.
[1:49:32] You've got the Holy Ghost. You've got an
[1:49:34] angelic presence. You've got all kinds
[1:49:36] of wonderful things to prepare you. But
[1:49:39] you can look starting right now and look
[1:49:41] for another thousand years and you ain't
[1:49:43] going to find no white flag of surrender
[1:49:46] because the Lord don't equip his people
[1:49:48] with a white flag. Well, devil, we're
[1:49:50] going to give up. We're going to give
[1:49:52] up, devil, we ain't never giving up. We
[1:49:55] ain't never quitting. We ain't never
[1:49:57] shutting up. Oh, hallelujah. Why?
[1:49:59] Because we are the army of the living
[1:50:02] God. And the background prophecies of
[1:50:05] our scriptures has already said we have
[1:50:08] victory.
[1:50:10] [Applause]
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:50:17] Though a host
[1:50:20] should encamp against me, my heart shall
[1:50:22] not fear. Brother, you better believe
[1:50:24] that's going to take God.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; And remember, David was a hunter. So
[1:50:28] he'd go out in the wilderness and spend
[1:50:30] many days by himself hunting.
[1:50:33] So we say he went to bed last night.
[1:50:36] Everything was calm. Everything was
[1:50:38] fine. He gets up this morning. He's
[1:50:41] stretching, you know, just waking up and
[1:50:43] everything. Going to eat a little bit of
[1:50:45] honey, a little bit of dried fruits and
[1:50:47] the Mediterranean diet, you know, all
[1:50:49] the stuff that he brought with him. And
[1:50:50] he walks out, brother Joe, and splashes
[1:50:52] his face with a little bit of water and
[1:50:54] praise the Lord. The Lord is my shepherd
[1:50:58] and man. Glory to God. And he looks up
[1:51:00] there and there's a whole host of
[1:51:03] Philistines or Amorites or Hittites or
[1:51:06] whoever it was all around everywhere. A
[1:51:09] whole host against one man. Though host
[1:51:13] should encamp against me, my heart shall
[1:51:16] not fear. Though war should rise against
[1:51:20] me, in this will I be confident. One
[1:51:24] thing singular your eyes. One thing have
[1:51:28] I desired of the Lord that will I seek
[1:51:33] after that I may dwell in the house of
[1:51:36] the Lord. Oh hallelujah. All the days of
[1:51:40] my life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[1:51:44] and to inquire in his temple. Look how
[1:51:48] when David goes to talking about the
[1:51:50] house of God and entering into his
[1:51:53] shikina presence, what's the last verse
[1:51:56] that he refers to? A war has broke out.
[1:52:00] A war has broke out. Oh my. And we know
[1:52:03] that Israel is a type of the brideg.
[1:52:04] They've been attacked from the north by
[1:52:06] Hezbollah. They've been attacked from
[1:52:08] the east and the west by Iran and by all
[1:52:11] these different people. The only
[1:52:12] direction they ain't been attacked from
[1:52:14] is up above this way. And you look, no
[1:52:17] matter where they are, they're totally
[1:52:18] surrounded. A little old state about the
[1:52:20] size of New Jersey. And they've got
[1:52:22] millions and millions of Arabs against
[1:52:25] them on every side. So have you little
[1:52:27] bride. You've got demons against your
[1:52:29] denominationalism. You've got demons
[1:52:32] against you. This bunch that's left the
[1:52:34] message and trying to bring reproach
[1:52:36] upon it. Come on, somebody. Follow the
[1:52:38] sign and believe the sign and whatever
[1:52:40] more. But let me tell you, let me point
[1:52:42] you up this way. You've got a captain of
[1:52:45] hosts that's standing up here that says,
[1:52:47] "Come on, little bride. Come with me out
[1:52:50] of Lebanon. Come with me out of Shener.
[1:52:54] Come with me out of Hermmont. Leave the
[1:52:57] snow behind. Leave the leopards behind.
[1:53:00] Hallelujah. Leave the lions behind.
[1:53:03] Little bride. Come on home.
[1:53:07] [Applause]
[1:53:19] Now the seal breaks open on a
[1:53:21] furtherance of her identity
[1:53:24] spouse
[1:53:27] because the day of a spousal was over.
[1:53:32] So now she takes on the name of the work
[1:53:35] that he has done in her life. He has
[1:53:37] espoused her and now she becomes that
[1:53:40] work.
[1:53:44] Let me find a place to close here in a
[1:53:46] little bit.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; I told the church not long ago, I said,
[1:53:50] you know, preachers get up and they
[1:53:51] said, I'm closing. I'm closing. I'm
[1:53:53] closing. Said some of y'all may think
[1:53:54] they're lying, but I say a lot of time
[1:53:55] preachers got a lot of doors open, so
[1:53:57] they just shut one door and then they
[1:53:58] shut another door and then they shut
[1:53:59] another door. So, I'm on the way of
[1:54:01] closing.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; Y'all act like you're okay with it
[1:54:05] anyway, ain't you?
[1:54:07] Notice verse nine.
[1:54:10] Thou hast ravished
[1:54:13] my heart.
[1:54:17] My sister.
[1:54:19] Watch her. Now she gets another another
[1:54:22] title.
[1:54:24] Sister.
[1:54:27] It's the first time he's called her
[1:54:28] this. Watching her relationship as she's
[1:54:31] walking, getting closer and closer,
[1:54:33] moving closer to his presence.
[1:54:39] Thou has ravished my heart, my sister,
[1:54:43] my spouse. Thou has ravished my heart
[1:54:45] with one
[1:54:48] with one of thine eyes,
[1:54:51] with one chain
[1:54:53] of thy neck. How fair is thy love, my
[1:54:58] sister,
[1:55:00] my spouse.
[1:55:02] How much better is thy love than wine
[1:55:04] and the smell of thine an ointments
[1:55:08] than all spices?
[1:55:10] Thy lips, oh my spouse,
[1:55:13] drop as the honeycomb.
[1:55:15] Honey and milk are under thy tongue and
[1:55:17] the smell of thy garments.
[1:55:20] It's like the smell of Lebanon.
[1:55:23] They say one thing that Lebanon is
[1:55:25] famous for still to this day are the
[1:55:28] cedars
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; of Lebanon. That's right.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; And we know a cedar
[1:55:35] has two colors of wood, both red and
[1:55:39] white.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; What does it signify? The cross.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; So the bride is so anointed
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; with the campher and the myrr and the
[1:55:49] sandalwood and all the spices from his
[1:55:52] presence.
[1:55:54] And then she has this aroma of the
[1:55:57] cross.
[1:56:00] Oh,
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; thy lips, so my spouse drop as a
[1:56:04] honeycomb. Honey, and milk are under thy
[1:56:06] tongue. And the smell of thy garments is
[1:56:09] like the smell of Lebanon. A garden
[1:56:12] enclosed
[1:56:14] is my sister, my spouse.
[1:56:19] A spring shut up, a fountain,
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; sealed. Amen.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Here's the bride going in the rapture.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; Sealed.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; By the Holy Ghost.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; She ain't flirting with the devil.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Uh-uh. She don't want to be married to
[1:56:38] Jesus and have a a boyfriend call the
[1:56:40] devil on the side.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Sleeping around here and sleeping around
[1:56:44] there like the modern day does. Come on,
[1:56:46] somebody.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Not the bride. No, the bride is a garden
[1:56:51] enclosed. What's happened? He's brought
[1:56:53] her back again. the restitution of Eden.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; For it was a woman who fell in the
[1:57:01] Garden of Eden.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; It'll be a woman that will be restored
[1:57:05] not in the Garden of Eden, but in
[1:57:07] Satan's Eden.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; Where it's so dark and filthy and
[1:57:11] corrupt. And God will say to her, "You
[1:57:14] are a garden enclosed."
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; I know people look at us and say, "Poor
[1:57:21] things. I feel so sorry for them. They
[1:57:25] can't do this and they can't do that and
[1:57:27] they can't go here and they can't go
[1:57:28] there and they can't wear this and they
[1:57:30] can't, you know, do this and that and
[1:57:32] the other. They're just behind walls.
[1:57:34] They're just they're they're prisoners.
[1:57:36] They're prisoners.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, we don't deny that we're not behind
[1:57:40] walls.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; But what we deny is it's not a prison to
[1:57:44] us.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; It's a castle.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; It's a castle. It's our king's walls. We
[1:57:52] are a garden enclosed. Can you imagine
[1:57:56] friends? As I heard the prophet said
[1:57:57] this week and I'll close. The reason of
[1:58:00] this whole dark sinful age is to prove
[1:58:05] to Satan she's not the type of woman
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; that Eve was.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; Help me not to fail, Lord.
[1:58:20] Song of Solomon chapter 5 verse1
[1:58:23] I am come into my garden
[1:58:27] my sister my spouse
[1:58:31] I have gathered myrr with my spice
[1:58:35] I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey
[1:58:38] I have drunk my wine with my milk yay oh
[1:58:43] friends drink yay drink abundantly
[1:58:49] Oh beloved.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Now here of course is whenever the
[1:58:55] friend of the bridegroom comes
[1:58:59] and brings the bride answering to the
[1:59:01] parable of Matthew 25.
[1:59:04] And the kingdom of heaven shall be
[1:59:05] likened unto 10 virgins. Five were wise
[1:59:09] and five were foolish. You know the
[1:59:11] story. I'll brief it. At midnight a cry
[1:59:13] went forth, go ye out to meet the
[1:59:15] bridegroom, that all of those virgins
[1:59:16] arose and trimmed their lamps. Then the
[1:59:18] food is said unto the wise, give us of
[1:59:20] your oil, for our lamps have gone out.
[1:59:22] And the wise said, not so, lest we have
[1:59:24] not enough for ourselves. But go you to
[1:59:27] them that sell and buy. And while they
[1:59:29] were gone, behold, the bridegroom came.
[1:59:33] You see, it was the friend of the
[1:59:34] bridegroom who knocked on the father's
[1:59:36] house
[1:59:37] where the bride was and gave the bride
[1:59:40] her wedding garments from the groom.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; So, the father, the groom has now
[1:59:46] commissioned the friend of the
[1:59:47] bridegroom to go back. And now he's
[1:59:49] knocking on the door again
[1:59:53] and he's telling the bride, "Today is
[1:59:56] the day."
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; Get ready.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; Get your clothes on, girl. Hallelujah.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; It's going home time.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:00:17] So, the friend
[2:00:21] leads the pack as they come back
[2:00:24] and the bridegroom is right behind him.
[2:00:26] The musicians are blowing on the
[2:00:28] trumpets. They're playing their symbols.
[2:00:31] They're Music is being made and here
[2:00:34] they come.
[2:00:37] And the bridegroom comes
[2:00:40] and takes her from her father's house.
[2:00:45] Takes her now to his house, the new
[2:00:47] house he built for her.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; So they have what is called a hoopa
[2:00:53] which is made out of four poles. So they
[2:00:55] plant a certain tree when a baby boy is
[2:00:57] born and plant another tree when a baby
[2:00:59] girl is born. And when they're going to
[2:01:00] get married, they cut down that tree and
[2:01:02] cut it in half. And two legs come from
[2:01:04] his tree and two come from her tree.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; So the man tree and the woman tree meet
[2:01:09] together under the trees.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; So they come under the tent and he takes
[2:01:17] the last cup of the wine.
[2:01:21] A very brief summary of an agreement of
[2:01:23] their vows.
[2:01:25] Then he takes her into the bridal
[2:01:29] chamber. Amen.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Wonder why it is called bridal chamber
[2:01:32] and not groom chamber. Did you ever
[2:01:35] wonder why that the man is called the
[2:01:37] bridegroom
[2:01:39] instead of the bride being called the
[2:01:43] bridegroom or the groom bride? Or why is
[2:01:47] it that the man takes on bridegroom
[2:01:51] and the bride is just simply called
[2:01:53] bride? Well, how come she isn't called
[2:01:56] the groom's bride?
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; So, he takes her into the tent
[2:02:05] and he goes in unto her and then he
[2:02:07] comes out with the tokens of virginity
[2:02:11] and he presents them to who? The friend
[2:02:15] of the bridegroom.
[2:02:17] Now, this is the recital of Song of
[2:02:19] Solomon 5:1. Rejoice, oh friends. I have
[2:02:23] partaken of the wine. I have partaken of
[2:02:26] this and that. What did he find
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; that his bride
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; was a pure unadulterated
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; bride word.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; For here's the proof.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; The blood
[2:02:40] on the cloth.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Then the friend of the bridegroom w
[2:02:47] marches out and says, "Rejoice
[2:02:49] everybody." And you imagine he he had
[2:02:52] been sitting there sweating bullets as
[2:02:54] we'd say, "Man alive, if she's not a
[2:02:56] virgin, he's responsible."
[2:02:59] But here he comes out and said,
[2:03:00] "Everything is good. Go tell him. Go
[2:03:02] tell them."
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'll tell you one thing. When I
[2:03:05] stand there that day, I want to be
[2:03:06] identified with that friend of the
[2:03:08] bridegroom.
[2:03:09] [Applause]
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[2:03:16] [Music]
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:03:21] Let me share this with you before I let
[2:03:23] you go. In verse n again, thou hast
[2:03:26] ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse.
[2:03:29] The word spouse is used six times in the
[2:03:31] Bible. All six or in the Song of
[2:03:35] Solomon.
[2:03:38] Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister,
[2:03:40] my spouse.
[2:03:42] The Latin Vulgate version of this says
[2:03:45] it this way. Thou hast wounded
[2:03:48] my heart.
[2:03:50] Thou hast draw my heart
[2:03:54] unto thee.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; I love the meaning of this word and the
[2:04:00] way that they wrote it. It means to be
[2:04:02] robbed of one's will or a power
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; or ability
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; to think clearly.
[2:04:13] to be robbed of one's will
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; or power.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Can't you see what moved him to say what
[2:04:20] he did in the garden of Gethsemane?
[2:04:23] Nevertheless, not my will.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; But thine be done. What was it? The
[2:04:30] love,
[2:04:32] the love of his life,
[2:04:36] his sweetheart.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him today?
[2:04:44] Let's just bow our heads.
[2:04:52] No doubt as we stand here today and our
[2:04:56] needs are as diverse as the people who
[2:04:57] make up this congregation here.
[2:05:01] And then we have all those that will be
[2:05:03] streaming and archiving the service and
[2:05:05] all of that and their needs will be
[2:05:07] varied as well.
[2:05:10] But the Lord Jesus knows what you have
[2:05:12] need of.
[2:05:15] Maybe you find yourself in the lion's
[2:05:17] den or
[2:05:19] the leopards are near you and you're
[2:05:20] afraid.
[2:05:22] Maybe you find yourself entangled again.
[2:05:24] You pick up something that you let go
[2:05:29] and it's got a hold on you.
[2:05:34] Maybe you're sealed with the Holy Ghost
[2:05:36] and you are just waiting on the coming
[2:05:38] of the Lord. but you just feel like
[2:05:41] today you need a refreshing in his
[2:05:43] presence.
[2:05:44] Maybe you're lost. You've never given
[2:05:46] your heart to God.
[2:05:49] The Lord knows exactly what every one of
[2:05:51] us need. I believe with all of my heart
[2:05:54] I have the Holy Ghost. I believe I'm
[2:05:55] born again.
[2:05:57] But my need today
[2:06:00] is to be so filled with his presence.
[2:06:03] How many you Holy Ghost fil people feel
[2:06:05] that way today?
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. just refreshed, renewed
[2:06:10] in the presence of God.
[2:06:13] [Music]
[2:06:15] Lord Jesus, as we bow our heads
[2:06:19] to Hermon and Shener
[2:06:23] and Amanda, where we come from the dust
[2:06:25] of the earth,
[2:06:29] we acknowledge our need of you is so
[2:06:31] great, Lord.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:06:34] For some, maybe, Father, they've never
[2:06:36] made a commitment to you,
[2:06:39] but they feel you dealing with their
[2:06:41] hearts today. Maybe for some, they've
[2:06:43] made that commitment, but they've never
[2:06:45] moved beyond just being saved into
[2:06:48] sanctification.
[2:06:50] Maybe some have moved through
[2:06:51] sanctification, but they've never
[2:06:53] received the Holy Ghost. You know every
[2:06:56] need. Father,
[2:06:58] help us, Lord.
[2:07:01] I thought I was ready for today.
[2:07:04] [Music]
[2:07:05] But you changed me
[2:07:09] and my direction
[2:07:11] so I know it was for the needs of your
[2:07:13] children. Your present father.
[2:07:18] Oh Jesus, may we hear your call, Father.
[2:07:23] I want to fight faithful.
[2:07:26] I've got them scars of them lines all
[2:07:28] over me. I've got leopard scars on my
[2:07:31] spirit
[2:07:33] just like all the rest of these people
[2:07:34] do.
[2:07:37] Oh, but I'm waiting for that call. Come
[2:07:40] away, my love.
[2:07:42] Leave the lion's dens. Leave the
[2:07:45] leopard's lair.
[2:07:48] Lord,
[2:07:50] come away,
[2:07:55] my love.
[2:07:59] Come
[2:08:01] away,
[2:08:06] my love.
[2:08:09] Oh Jesus, help us, Father. I've waited
[2:08:13] for this day.
[2:08:16] I could give to you my name.
[2:08:22] Eternity
[2:08:25] awaits us.
[2:08:27] Come away
[2:08:32] ma.
[2:08:34] Everybody now. Oh,
[2:08:37] come away.
[2:08:43] My love.
[2:08:46] Are you ready? Come away.
[2:08:50] You got everything fixed in your heart.
[2:08:54] You got the Holy Ghost. Are you sealed
[2:08:56] away?
[2:08:58] Nothing you need to make right. Nothing
[2:09:00] you need to fix.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; If you don't, you can make it right
[2:09:07] right now. Right in this presenceity
[2:09:10] awaits us.
[2:09:12] Come away.
[2:09:15] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:09:17] My love. Everybody together now. Oh,
[2:09:21] come away.
[2:09:24] Come away,
[2:09:27] my love.
[2:09:32] Come away,
[2:09:37] my love.
[2:09:40] Thank you, Lord Jesus. I've waited for
[2:09:44] this day
[2:09:46] when I could give to you my new name,
[2:09:52] eternity. He awaits us.
[2:09:56] Come away.
[2:10:03] My love,
[2:10:05] would you do me a favor? Would you mind
[2:10:08] laying your hand over on the person
[2:10:09] standing by you?
[2:10:11] Brothers, if it's near a sister and you
[2:10:13] don't know and you don't feel
[2:10:14] comfortable in doing that, you can get
[2:10:15] out and move if you'd like.
[2:10:18] I want you not praying for yourself now,
[2:10:20] but for that brother or sister that
[2:10:22] you're standing by. God alone knows
[2:10:25] their need.
[2:10:27] God knows where they are today and what
[2:10:28] they're going through.
[2:10:32] Let's just pray together, saints of God.
[2:10:36] Lord Jesus, your word tells us the
[2:10:38] effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous
[2:10:40] man avail much. And we believe it's not
[2:10:43] just a man but also daughters of God.
[2:10:46] We have our hands laid one upon the
[2:10:48] other today. Father, we reach across the
[2:10:51] aisle or we step out from the aisle to
[2:10:53] another seat there and be able to touch
[2:10:56] someone and pray for them.
[2:10:58] Lord Jesus, you know every need, every
[2:11:01] desire.
[2:11:02] Father, maybe some of them find themsel
[2:11:04] in the lion's den.
[2:11:07] The den was empty when they went in, but
[2:11:10] since they've been in there, them lions
[2:11:12] have filled it up.
[2:11:14] And if you don't move for them, they'll
[2:11:16] be gone.
[2:11:18] They fooled around the leopard's lair
[2:11:20] when they shouldn't have done it. They
[2:11:22] sneaked around and caught the leopard
[2:11:24] gone, they thought. But now the leopard
[2:11:26] has got them up a tree, got them in a in
[2:11:29] a den somewhere, and they're scared for
[2:11:31] their life. Father, may the angels of
[2:11:33] God sweep through this place today,
[2:11:35] Lord. I pray in the name of Jesus. Would
[2:11:39] you minister to the sick? Father,
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; would you minister to those that are
[2:11:43] bound, those that are weary, Father,
[2:11:45] those that have lost loved ones and
[2:11:48] still going through the grieving
[2:11:49] process. I pray for them today, Lord. I
[2:11:52] pray for those, Father, that aren't born
[2:11:54] again, for those that still need the
[2:11:56] Holy Ghost in their soul. Dear God, may
[2:11:59] this be the day, Lord. We truly see the
[2:12:03] prophecies of Psalms 27 being fulfilled
[2:12:06] in our day. But we know we are a people
[2:12:09] of victory. We are not a people of
[2:12:12] shame. We are not a people of defeat.
[2:12:16] Lord God, we believe we are waiting for
[2:12:19] that call when you will call for us to
[2:12:21] come away and rise to our Jerusalem.
[2:12:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:12:29] Oh blessed father may your presence from
[2:12:32] the pull pit to the back upstairs where
[2:12:35] the brothers are there in the internet
[2:12:36] room and running the sound booth out on
[2:12:39] the internet Lord Africa Europe wherever
[2:12:41] they are around the world may the Holy
[2:12:43] Ghost go into their homes right now
[2:12:45] Father may the angels of God I pray
[2:12:48] visit them I just read before I come to
[2:12:49] church today the prophet said we the
[2:12:52] reason we don't have more angels
[2:12:54] visiting homes today is because people's
[2:12:57] lives are full of television
[2:12:59] full of the world and full of all kinds
[2:13:01] of things. And the angels only visit
[2:13:04] those homes that are worthy, noble
[2:13:07] homes. Oh Lord, that's the kind of homes
[2:13:09] that we want. We want our homes, oh
[2:13:12] Lord, that the angels of God can feel
[2:13:14] comfortable. We want our church to be a
[2:13:17] place that the angels of God can feel
[2:13:20] welcome. Lord, we worship you, Lord
[2:13:23] Jesus.
[2:13:25] We bless your name, Holy Father.
[2:13:29] Hallelujah.
[2:13:30] Thank you, Lord.
[2:13:33] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:13:35] Can we just raise our hands, saints, in
[2:13:38] his presence now, whatever you have need
[2:13:40] of, claim it as yours as a son or
[2:13:43] daughter of God.
[2:13:45] Amen. We love you, Lord. We love you,
[2:13:48] Lord.
[2:13:50] We worship you, heavenly father. We
[2:13:52] bless your name today, Lord Jesus.
[2:13:55] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[2:13:59] We worship you today, Lord God. We
[2:14:02] praise your holy name. Thank you. We
[2:14:05] have heard your cry to come out of
[2:14:07] Hermon. We've heard the cry, "Come out
[2:14:10] of a mana, come out from Shener, leave
[2:14:13] the lion's dens behind." Thank you, Lord
[2:14:16] Jesus. You didn't call us low down,
[2:14:19] sorry, rotten, but you kept identifying
[2:14:22] us higher and higher. The closer we
[2:14:24] come, the more terms of endearment you
[2:14:27] used upon our life. Praise the Lord, my
[2:14:31] love, my sister, my spouse. Oh Jesus, we
[2:14:36] worship you today. Lord, we desire to be
[2:14:39] a masterpiece of your great work.
[2:14:42] Father,
[2:14:43] we love you, Lord. We love you, Lord
[2:14:47] Jesus. We worship you today, Father.
[2:14:51] Hallelujah. Listen it this way. Jesus
[2:14:55] has a table spread where the saints of
[2:14:59] God are fed. He invites his chosen
[2:15:03] people coming down
[2:15:07] with his manner
[2:15:10] and supplies our every need. Oh sweet
[2:15:15] with Jesus all the time. Everybody now.
[2:15:20] Oh, come and die. The master called us.
[2:15:23] Come and die.
[2:15:26] We made feast at Jesus table all the
[2:15:30] time.
[2:15:33] He fed the multitude.
[2:15:36] Turn the water into wine. to the hungry
[2:15:41] callers now. Come and die.
[2:15:46] But the disciples came the lamb, thus
[2:15:50] obeying Christ's command. For the master
[2:15:54] called to them,
[2:15:56] come and die.
[2:16:02] Glory
[2:16:04] upon the father. Thou see he satisfied.
[2:16:07] Sing it now.
[2:16:09] Every time
[2:16:12] come and die, the master call comes
[2:16:20] at Jesus table all the time.
[2:16:25] He fit to turn the water into wine to
[2:16:32] the hungry call now. Come and die. Let's
[2:16:36] sing this verse together. Oh, soon the
[2:16:39] lamb will take his bride to be ever at
[2:16:44] his side. All the host of heaven will
[2:16:48] assemble me. Oh, think about it,
[2:16:52] children. Our glorious son, all you
[2:16:56] saints, spotless one, and with Jesus we
[2:17:00] will feast eternally.
[2:17:04] Oh, come and die. The master caller,
[2:17:08] come and die.
[2:17:11] Oh, we may feast at Jesus table all the
[2:17:15] time.
[2:17:18] We who fed the multitude.
[2:17:21] Turn the water into your wine to the
[2:17:26] hungry call is now coming down.
[2:17:33] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[2:17:39] Hallelujah.
[2:17:41] Why don't you turn around and shake
[2:17:42] hands with that person standing by you
[2:17:44] and tell them, "I plan on seeing you
[2:17:46] there.
[2:17:48] I plan on seeing you there, brother,
[2:17:50] sister. I plan on seeing y'all, saints.
[2:17:53] Plan on seeing you all." Amen. Praise
[2:17:56] the Lord. God bless you. Love you so
[2:17:58] much. Want to say thank you for all of
