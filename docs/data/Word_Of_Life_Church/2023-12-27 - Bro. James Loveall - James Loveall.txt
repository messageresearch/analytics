richest human beings that has ever lived on this Earth aren't you glad we can have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ how many is happy to be in the house of the Lord come to receive something from the Lord tonight he's so mindful of us we have a surprise brother James love all is going to be speaking for us tonight and I'm not sure who's the most surprised you all or him and then secondly his wife he didn't even tell her after Christmas CU he didn't want to scare her to death so we're so happy to have him here visiting with us and we're just praying God will bless our hearts tonight and speak to us I know we have many needs don't we have many in our assembly that's sick dealing with flu and um covid and viruses and all kinds of things that are going on but we believe our lord Jesus brother Daryl displayed it to us so beautifully on Sunday when he come he come to pay the price so we could be healed so I know it hurts your heart as it does m to hear the different ones that are sick we're going to pray again before brother James comes but I'd also like to make it known to you that brother Jee Littleton is um certainly sounds like getting close to time to to leave so we want to remember him and uh his breath breathing is getting more shallow and all of that I heard from his son this afternoon I know that appreciate our prayers my daughter Lis has been very sick pray that you'd just remember her also run to brother Bill yon the other day at at brother Kelvin Wards funeral and he told me that he had had shingles for about 20 weeks or so so I know that he would certainly appreciate our prayers we believe the Lord's mindful how many of you all have a need a request on your heart tonight can we just take it to the Lord right now and we'll ask the blessings on the word and then we'll ask brother James to come Heavenly Father we love you so much tonight we thank you for this hour that we live in for this opportunity once again father that we can come to church church for us is more than just something we do two or three times a week we we so look forward to being in your presence being with our brothers and sisters hearing the songs worshiping praising sensing your presence around us knowing that this is a place of healing and deliverance and correction and so many things father that we receive when we come to the house of God and tonight we believe will be nothing short of all of those things that we've just mentioned you told us if there's any two would Gather in your name two or three oh Lord there's way more than that here tonight so we're believing that you're going to come and speak to us Lord you heard these needs and requests and we're just asking you that you'd be mindful of each of them Lord we know the darkness is pressing against us so much in the age that we're living it's hard to imagine father that we are still here and we're at the end of 23 and going into 24 for in a few days most of us never thought we would ever be here this long but we're praying however long we have we want to give you everything that we have left and we want to torment hell every day that we live father we are not waving no White Flag to the devil but we're saying Satan you better look out cuz here we come but father we need your anointing your strength your presence to help us so we pray that you'd be mindful of it tonight brother James going to come and speak to us we pray Lord that you just anoint him help him to be able to move out of the way father may we pull on the gift of God in the life of our brother may you just speak to us tonight as only you can do in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it and the Saints Said Amen brother James love all God bless you brother praise the Lord happy to be in the house of the Lord it's certainly an honor and privilege to be here and to be gathered in the house and we thank for the Donnie for this opportunity uh certainly it came at a surprise like you said but that's what we're here for to help with brother Donnie you know you see the things that he's going through and we see what the family has been through and we just to whatever way we can and we certainly ask that the Lord be mindful of us tonight that he would Minister the word that the word would go forth and it would have an effect in our lives if you have your Bibles we certainly want to bring greetings from brother Ron Peterson in the church there in Phoenix and as brother Donnie said my wife Allison is around here somewhere with my two boys Dean and Nolan somewhere in the marriage contract in the fine lines that had I move rout West and I bring her home for the holidays but you know this is certainly a a special place and it's a home away from home we have a lot of family friends here and we just trust that we can say something that would be a blessing to you if you have your Bibles we can turn to 2 Corinthians chapter 4 second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 8 it says we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always always bearing about the body of the ding of the Lord Jesus that the life of Jesus might be made manifest in our bodies let's skip down to verse 16 for this cause we thank not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day how many's thankful that you can be renewed day by day his mercy and his grace are renewed every day in verse 18 while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal if you can turn over to Ephesians 5 Ephesians 5 and verse1 15 Ephesians 5:15 it says seeing then that you walk circumspectly meaning live carefully morally cautiously not as fools but as wise Redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore you walk not unwise but understanding the what the will of the Lord is if we could just bow our heads for a moment Heavenly Father we've come to the portion of of the preaching of the word Lord Lord songs have been sung and atmosphere has been set but Lord we're asking for your divine presence to come and to minister to your hearts of the people father May the word go forth and have an effect may it just not be words that they hear from me and they walk out and say it was good to be in church and it sounded good and but Lord may it be a a word that would fall into the ground of our hearts that it would go down into the very Souls that father we can say from this day forward something was spoken that it changed my life that something there was said that father we can walk away a different people because when we come in contact with you that's when you Lord you change our lives you you make us different and we're just asking once again for your presence to come and father take this vessel and move it aside Lord you take everything under your control For Your Glory we're just asking that you would have your way in this service Lord we commit it in thy hands in Jesus precious name amen and amen you can be seated as I said we certainly want to thank brother Donnie for the opportunity now the Bible says let us redeem the time and that's why we've gathered on a Wednesday night you know to the majority of people Christmas is over they've come to church and the next time they'll Grace the doors is on Easter right to them it's just a religion to them they know Christ is an event in history you see and so but we have a great opportunity that we can gather in the house of God on a Wednesday night we can come and we can give him praise we can give him admiration we can thank him for his goodness his Mercy we can give him praise and tell him how much we love him what he's done for us what he means to us what a great opportunity it is that's why the Bible says let us redeem the time what an evil time that we're living in people don't know who they are what gender they are it's an identity Christ is out in the world but I'm so thankful that we have an opportunity to come into the house of God and to hear the word to hear the word go forth and it can have an effect in our lives and I begin to think that that great Eternal God who had no beginning had no end an all knowing god omnipresent omnipotent and he became he came down and created this form of time and within time this space of time he would begin to deal with his people but yet in time he created moments now moments is what makes God personal to you moments are times that God comes down and he reveals himself to you moments are times that he comes and He makes himself known when you're sick and Afflicted he comes down as a Healer right when you don't know who you are he might come down and he might deliver you right when you need a savior he'll come down and he'll deliver you but yet in those moments it what makes God personal to you and to lay a foundation here in brother brandham says and S we'd see Jesus he says now we get ourselves worked up in this human element of time and a time element He says the only thing that we know is inches feet yards miles measures days weeks hours and months but God is eternal we have a limited power and limited intelligence you see on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came down it was the earnest of their inheritance it's the earnest so we have a limited power and a limited in in intelligence but yet God that he isn't just going to leave us with that limited power thank you Lord it's just the earnest but he says but God is infinite and all knowing he knows all things he knew all things before the world began he knew this meeting would be here tonight he knew knew all things would be before the world began and he could tell what the the end of time from the beginning that makes him God nothing else no one else no other being no other person could ever do that but God alone so let me ask you what concerns you tonight what problems do we have what sickness do we have that God can't answer amen what situation in our lives that God isn't there to see us through he's an everpresent help in the time of needen but yet as us as human beings we begin to look at the temporal things these things brother random would talk about our five senses we begin to let allow our senses to control the things around us the circumstances around us but can I say the circumstance that you're going through through is not you are not defined by that circumstance you are not defined by that situation that that problem that you have that trial that you have you are not defined by that circumstance amen thank you Lord and so tonight if I can just uh take a thought it would be the difference of a moment the difference of a moment and for a a subject we'd like to TI title it from that time and so brother brandham says here that we have these this human element and a time element now we have this human human element that we're all made up of nobody's exempt do we have any Angels amongst us No Angels so we can all set our Halos under our chairs for this service and we can talk because we all are made up of this flesh we came into this world born in flesh born in sin and iniquity came in this world speaking lies and as long as we're in this flesh we'll have a sticky nature and this sticky nature will be with us until the the changing of our bodies so what we have to do is we have to bring this flesh man this human element into subjection to the word of God we have to bring it into subjection to the word of God our thoughts have to come into subjection to the word of God everything we do has to come into subjection to the word of God as we read that our inward man is renewed day in and day out every day we must renew that Inward manen and the other element that we are trapped in is this time element we're creatures of time each one of us we can show our true colors when we come to church some of us are early some of us are on time and some of us are late it never fails We're All Creatures of time our schedules are made up of time we look in the past and our human element would tell us that the past is the history we can read our Bible Bibles and see what God has done in the past we can read of stories how God moved for others down through time and we can read in our Bibles in Revelations and you can see what God is going to do you can see the prophecies that are being fulfilled in our day or have been fulfill amen you see these things are elements of time in the future element we can read and Revelations of what God is going to do but yeah brother Brandon would tell us that we have to be careful to not remember be get caught up in the things of our pasttime and look into what God is doing and missing the very thing that God is doing in our midst because that's the moment that God is trying to make his time personal to you you see because that moment and what you do in that moment as the individual could alter your course the opportunities that God presents to you in that moment can alter the course of your walk is many times in our lives we go about life and we get caught up in a routine doing the same things over and over and you know sometimes God comes by and he ministers to our hearts and he and he wraps his arms of compassion around us sometimes we we get low and we get tired and sometimes he feels like he's right next door and he's right with you and he wraps his arms and you're so tenderhearted and you're so loving and compassionate you have love for your brother and then there sometimes he pulls himself back he pulls himself back and he wants to see where you're at sometimes it feels like you're walking all alone yeah as a story would tell us the one set of footprints on the sand but yet it's God carrying us he doesn't love us any different amen and so this time element there's a saying that time will tell time is the greatest revealer of things you give something time time will tell I've had a lot of friends grew up in the message my entire life and I had a lot of friends you know they they get on fire for God and they get filled they say they get filled and have an experience with God but yet time will tell your life will manifest of the experience that you say you got if you say you got the holy ghost that time will tell if that Holy Ghost is there or not time will tell you see because whenever the Holy Ghost comes inside you it's a new birth it's a changing of your body it's the changing the way you think the way you talk the way you act you see when Jacob wrestled with the angel he walked different how did people know that he had an encounter with God because he walked different from that time on and so we realize that when you come and encounter with God and you wrestle with an angel you'll walk different you'll talk different and time is a great revealer of that yes sir you see nowadays everybody's a Christian everybody some form every especially out here in the South some form of Christianity but yet you see what they've done is they have some form of it and they've joined some religion why because they take and they hybrid the word of God they take the word of God and they take things that they don't agree with or things that they don't see just right or they don't suit it doesn't suit their lifestyle or things they want to live and how they want to live and they they live that way and they call themselves Christians sir because they want the name of Christ you see many times we you know you look out in the world and some tragedy happens something happens maybe it's a mass shooting the family gets in an accident whatever it may be what is the first thing they say what is the first thing they post pray let's pray let's pray they've never said a prayer in their life but let's pray why because they want the name and then they want Christ whenever he's convenient they want Christ in their life when when some things are going wrong when their children are going in the world in the direction that they shouldn't be you see they want Christ when he's convenient but yet they don't want the life of Christ am they don't want the very life and I say tonight give me the very Life of Christ that whenever I walk and I talk and I do the different things that there's something different that you're just not another Christian walking down the road but there's a different life because it's the life behind the name that makes the demons tremble it's the life behind the name that makes the difference everyone one of us as a Believer must have a life to back up that name we're all built around a schedule Monday through Friday we go to work we go to school Wednesdays we come to church Sundays we go to church and it becomes a routine and it becomes sometimes it seasons in our lives that we do the same things day in and day out day in and day out it just becomes the season of life that you're in sometimes it's a sickness in our body and it may raise up and you begin to say it's a season in our life and you know what I'm just going to accept that I'm just going to deal with the problem that I have and we just do it day in and day out but yet that's not who we are amen that's not who we are to just settle and just become conditioned to the ways of life that's right you know back home I was talking with an elder in our church and we begin to talk and he says you know I feel that sometimes we have it too easy are we really looking for the Rapture are we really seeking the mind of God and every day getting up and look getting up with a different expectation different anticipation of what God is going to do maybe there's some sick Afflicted in our midst maybe there's some with a question maybe there's some that haven't aren't living the way they should with Christ do we wake up with a different expectation of what God maybe today is my day amen Maybe today God will meet my need maybe today is something different but yet we wake up as humans and we wake up in this time element we get caught up in routine you know and I was asked do we just accept the season of life that we're in you know some of the younger families can sympathize with me some of the older ones won't because they'll say you'll get through it but you know when you have young kids and they're sick they're sick in their body and you're up all night and you're having to give them showers at 2:00 a.m. and and it just seems like they're long days and long nights and everything and then the sickness just keep rising up and you don't know what to do and it just becomes hard and all these yeah we'll get through it but sometimes do we forget to pray and seek God and say God help us and you pray and you pray and you pray and it's not answered so you know what I'm just going to give up I'm just going to accept the season of life that I'm in I'm just going to accept this sickness I'm going to accept this illness because I've prayed and I prayed and I prayed we're getting somewhere you see but let me ask you we're creatures of habit we do what feels good what works we do what feels good and what works but yet I believe that coming to the house of God and God began to deal with me with this personal to me is that sometimes we come to church and how many believes that God will speak to our hearts it's an expectation that we have right but yet sometimes we come and we just get in the car and we go and we we just show up to church and we know God is going to speak to our hearts but yet we call that expectation we call that expectation there was no prayer there was no anticipation there was no seeking the mind of God right for God to come on the scene to move in our children's lives to move in in any situation that we have brother Brandon would speak on expectations because whatever you expect when you come to the house of God is what you're going to get so I wonder those that have an illness a sickness did you come with a greater expectation do you wake up in the morning and say God I'm expecting today is my day and if it's not today then it's going to be tomorrow and if it's not tomorrow maybe it's the next day but you keep praying and believing because that's what believers do is they believe and they keep praying and they keep asking and they keep seeking the mind of God for the will of their life maybe today is your moment how do you know that the next prayer that you pray won't be the one that breaks through how do you know that next prayer won't be answered of God you begin to think of moments you see God doesn't need if we're sick in our body or we have an illness back pain whatever whatever it may be a heart condition God doesn't need hours of surgery he doesn't need to come in and perform hours of surgery sometimes he just needs a moment amen he just needs a moment of your time you know sometimes for a a backlin Christian one that's a wayward son a prodal he doesn't need an entire sermon preached at him sometimes it's a moment sometimes it's just a moment of his time that God would pass by his way I can see one back there that we prayed for and he's family and we prayed for it just takes a moment that God could walk by and meet you at a Waffle House no sermon preach no hands laid on just a moment that could change and alter his life and I can say that as Reed he has a special place because my wife we would sit there and we would pray and we would pray and you know he was in our wedding but yet yet at the time he wasn't living right he wasn't serving God he was doing things he shouldn't but yet in that time we didn't choose him to be in our wedding because of the condition he was in we didn't choose him because of that condition but we chose him because he meant something to us and that's what God does with some of us he don't choose you when you're down in the wall he doesn't choose you when you're down in the dirt but he chooses you not because of what you're in but because what he's going to make you because it's by predestination it's by election by what he's calling you to and he's called us to be Sons and Daughters of God brother brandom says he's called us to be Sons and Daughters of God and if we try to be anything else we've missed the mark so let's just be Sons and Daughters of god let's be ourselves let's serve God God just needs a moment to change your circumstance an let's turn to St John 5 St John 5 in verse two and it says now there isn't Jerusalem by the Sheep Market a pool which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda having five porches the Hebrew word Bethesda here means a House of Mercy or a House of Grace now I want us to understand you're all well taught that God uses names and he uses places to give us examples and show show us different things so I want us to remember that this is a House of Mercy a House of Grace in these lay a great multitude of infant it folk of blind halt withered waiting for the moving of the water for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and W and troubled the water and whoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in it was made whole of whatsoever disease he had and a certain man was there which have an infirmity 38 years and when Jesus saw him lie he knew that he had been now a long time in that case and he saith unto him wil thou be made whole and the impotent man answered him and said sir I have no man when the water is troubled to put me in the pool but while I am coming another Ste down before me and Jes Jesus saith unto him rise take up thy bed and walk and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked and the same day was the Sabbath day you see the difference of a moment it's not how we see it and not how we understand it it's not according to the law it's not according to the custom you see the custom of that day was the stirring of the water the custom of the day Jesus went unrecognized because they he didn't come as they thought they thought he would come a different way and yet he came and the baby laying in a Manger many times people miss him because they did Jesus doesn't come how they think he should come all right they don't recognize that he's in the midst how many times do this man laying there 38 years how many times did this man make an effort to get into the pool how many times this man try to make it into that water and see somebody else get their healing see somebody else get what they had need of for 38 years this man tried and tried and kept trying and pretty soon I would assume and this is how I feel that this man kept trying and trying and trying until pretty soon what's the use I've tried over and over somebody always beats me to it somebody always beats me to it I wonder how many times how many times do we come into this house of God a House of Mercy a House of Grace full of people with sickness illnesses amen people who are in troubled that's what this house of God is it's a hospital to those that are in need it's a it's a hospital to those that are sick and Afflicted those that are lost and can't find their way that's what the house of God is it's for those to come the sanctuary is for the hurting a place of sa safety for the lost because let me say this when the stirring of the water happens it's a time to get in when the stirring of the water happens you don't wait on somebody else you don't wait for somebody else you don't wait on your dad or your mom you don't wait on your neighbor because sometimes God isn't dealing with your neighbor he's dealing with you sometimes God is moving on your heart and he's convicting and he's pulling and he's saying saying you got to move you got to get your faith in action you got to make a move toward God because God said if you make a move toward me I'll make a step toward you it's putting your faith into action don't be relying upon somebody else because maybe that moment is for you and you'll miss it because you're relying on somebody else we come to church and when the stirring of the water happens that's when the healing happens that's when God moves it was God's Divine way and we don't come to be a spectator we don't come to be a spectator because Spectators don't have anything to do with the game Spectators just observe they just see what's going on they see others doing it and jumping and shouting and getting into the service but that's all they do that's what Spectators do at the game they pay thousands of dollars to go to a ball game they paint their faces they pay all this money and hope their team wins and hope that they don't get disappointed in the outcome of the game but I can tell you tonight that you won't be disappointed when you come to the house of God because when you come he's never lost the battle he's never lost the one he said everyone is in the palm of my hand I've never lost to [Applause] one we're not called to be Spectators we're not called to be ones to take up a Pew I'm called to fill up a Pew why because we got to get in the game and I I begin to read and about the Rich Young Ruler he's mentioned three times in the Bible in Matthew in Luke and then in Mark and two of them he says he says what must I do that I might inherit the kingdom of God he says do these things and he says I have kept these I have done these from my youth I have kept them I know what the law is I know the Commandments I know how to live right yes but yet one it says these have I observed from my youth these have I observed and it kind of struck me because I wonder how many times that we have young people and I did it for years because I was raised in the message and you come and You observe what's going on you know the Commandments you know how to live you know the different things to do the different things to say the right kind of Life to Live to put up on put a front on we know these different things but yet he observed these things from his youth but he never had an experience he never met God and so I begin to see that this Rich Young Ruler he had an opportunity he had a moment but yet he failed he chose differently he chose differently and from that time it altered the course of his life it altered the course of his life now and here he's making excuses just as this man was lying there he says do you want to be made whole and he says I have nobody to put me in he began to make excuses es yet we don't have an excuse young people from the youngest to the oldest you see God deals with the Gentiles differently God deals with the Gentiles as individuals he deals with you as individuals he doesn't deal with you as a group of body amen he deals with us and sometimes within our hearts he might send a conviction he might send something in our life to call you a little bit higher say throw away those things that you're doing don't do those things and yet he's calling us a little bit higher but yet he's dealing with you as an individual we know that the pool was God's way of Divine Healing for the people in that day it was the way of healing you see first and second pool were attraction pools they're attraction pools they begin to gather the people you see a great multitude had gathered here their attraction pools just like brother brandom's day when he had the healing campaigns down in Duran South Africa 25,000 people were healed at one time that was just the bait on the hook it was just the attraction but you see when you get into the third pool when you get to the revealing of the word let's go back to our story when you get to the revealing of the word Christ himself was the revealed word for that hour and he began to walk right amongst them and they missed him he was walking amongst them and they were waiting for the stirring of the water they were waiting for the troubling of the water and yet the Healer was walking right amongst them we must recognize the revealed word for our hour you see sometimes God he sends angels to do things for him yes in this story he would send an angel down to stir the water he would send an angel down at his certain season I don't know if it was every month every day every whenever it was but yet he would send an angel to do it and somebody would get healed but this day was different sometimes God sends angels and sometimes he goes down himself sometimes he wants to handle it himself sometimes he says Gabriel I I got this one today this man is going to meet the Healer he's not just going to get his healing but he's going to meet the Healer himself and that's what God does in our lives sometimes he comes down and he says you know what I'll handle this one just like the three Hebrew children he says you know what I'll do this myself I'm going to go down myself I'm going to be that Fourth Man In The Fire And he's still the same today he doesn't change his ways he doesn't change the way he operates you just must catch the revealing you must catch the transition that God is doing amen and Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he says now we realize that they've had Divine healings even before he come on Earth how many knows that the pool of Bethesda was a healing sign and down Through the Ages they've had all kinds of healing but there was supposed to be a sign following the Messiah he had a messiah sign and if he was Messiah which is the anointed one the Christ then there was a sign of the Messiah followed that Messiah he says there's a sign that follows the believer you believe that God is a god of of signs wonders and miracles and if he was the first if he did that the first time he's going to do that the second time and if he did that the second time he's going to do that the third time why because God don't change the way he operates if he healed one way he's going to do it again if he delivered one way he's going to do it again why because he's God and that's how we operate but sometimes within our minds we get caught up in this human element in this time element that we begin to realize and we begin to question why God would take one and he would raise up another he would deliver one and keep one down he would do a miracle on one and then he would do a healing on another yet the same situation but yet that's our human element that's our own carnal reasoning because he's God and he does what he wants he moves how he wants he says therefore what God Said is perfect if he ever called was called on the scene for a sinner the attitude he took toward that sinner he would have to do the same to the next any impotent sinner from thereafter if he ever was called on the scene to heal the sick the the attitude he took toward that sick person he would have to do the same because he acts the same way or if he acted the first time then he would have acted wrong which is not right therefore that's why God he says he acted the same or he did it when he acted the first time there's God you see God doesn't change his way that's the standard he has amen but yet we get caught up in this human element we know in our story brother Brandon would talk about this in hearing him he would say that this this man would be sick and afflicted for 38 years 38 years he had this and God would walk through the multitude to one heal the man and walk out and you say well I thought God was all omniscient I thought he was all caring he cares for us he has compassion for each one of us yet that compassion is to do the will of the father because later in that passage he says I can do nothing unless the father first show me it's no different with the prophet of this hour yes that's why he would stand there in a prayer line he said I'm waiting for him because I can do nothing unless he shows me first amen he says compassion is to do the will of God that's what real Christian Compassion is to do the will of God and we mix it up today and we try to put a human element to it and we get this human element mixed up with a Christian and godly element and then we make a mess out of it because we only know by inches feet and so forth by pounds and ounces and so forth that's what we know we're a time people people it's in all eternity with him and we try to bring God's Great infinite mind down to our little finite Minds you know what would solve that is prayer is prayer because brother brandom says it's not what brings God down to man but prayer is what brings go man up to God and when you begin to get up onto God and you get into that Eternal element that's why you can pray and you can seek the mind of God you can be going through the worst days of your life or sickness or trials and you begin to whenever you pray you begin to go up into the element where God dwells where he's all intient he's all caring and he knows the end from the beginning and he takes you up into that element and it takes away this human carnal reasoning and understanding amen prayer is the most powerful weapon we have as a believer he says and we get it all mixed up so the best thing to do is read his word and remember that his word will not contct itself you see when you begin to read his word his word is our blueprint it's our very TI poost everything that we have need of is in his word any answers any questions anything that we have need of is in his word that's our absolute that's what we go back to amen and we just must believe you see in our story we we see this man that was sick and God came and he came down now compassion is to do the will of the father and God would walk amongst it and he would speak the word to this man he would say take up thy bed and walk and he was made whole he didn't pray for him he didn't lay hands on him he spoke the word but yet our Bible says in Mark 16 that you lay hands on the sick and they shall recover you see it's doing the will of the father whatever he says do do right and we see here that natural healing is secondary we thank God for healing our bodies for touching us but healing of the soul is so much greater what is greater the the healing or the opening of you know blinded eyes or giving you Revelation and understanding which one is greater because sometimes we come in contact and we meet the Healer but yet we stop there we stop there we thank God for healing us but yet he tells us in this story that he meets the man in the temple and he says you have made been been made whole he says but go and sin no more and lest a greater thing come upon you lest a greater thing come upon you and I begin to think about what what this sin is because we receive our healing but then we stop and we don't go on and kick out the sin in our lives sin is unbelief everything else is just attributes of what sin produces but sin is unbelief and we we get our healing but we don't kick out that unbelief in our life and I wonder how many times that I did it as a young person you can go from Camp to Camp you can go from me meting to meeting you can go from prayer line to prayer line or you can come and have be prayed for for the same thing that you were prayed for last week right prayed for the week before last year why because you got your healing but you never kicked the sin out of your life we have things in our lives that we have to kick out we have to clean out we have to wash out you see the moving of the water brother brandom says that the moving of the water is also Revival in your life you say I'm not sick I'm not I don't have to wait for the moving of the water listen brother brandom says about the moving of the water he says it kicks the trash out of our life it's Revival he says a Revival don't don't mean you add anything to the church a Revival means you re revive what's already it it's got he says that's a Revival you see I he says I was standing there he's talking about up at Lake Michigan he said I was standing up there watching the waves come in and out and say oh the sea was jumping the water was jumping and the boats were rocking and I thought what's going on I thought why the lake is having a Revival that's it he says it's jumping and shaking why there's a rushing Mighty Wind coming down I thought well you know what it is he says there isn't one more drop of it than it had before when it was perfectly still he says no more water in it it's just all stirred up well now what's the stirring about you know what that stirring of the water does it washes everything out up into to the bank he says that's what we need a washing of unbelief out onto the bank let the word of God have preeminence that's what we need a Revival to wash out unbelief all the bugs superstitions and things come and see that God is still God and that's what we have revivals for you see when the stirring of the water happens what does water represent it's a body of people you see when the stirring of the water happens that's what revive Revival is and that's what it's for is to wash out all unbelief all the iniquity all the things in our lives things that we know that we shouldn't be doing and we're doing as Christians we should be living a higher life kicking out all the unbelief in our lives it's washing out all the unbelief and the things in our lives the go and sin no more I I was looking and go and sin no more is used two times in our Bible the first time was here in the in the the pool of Bethesda but the second one was whenever the woman was brought before Jesus right was brought before Jesus it was a woman caught in the very act it wasn't accusations or or or gossip amongst the church it it wasn't just something out there but she was caught in the very act and she was brought before judgment she was brought to be judged but yet this judgment when judgment was there when judgment was imminent that's when Grace stepped in that's when God said which of you has sin in your life you cast the first stone you cast the first stone and what did they do they walked away one by one from the oldest to the youngest what was it because they walked away ashamed they walked away with their heads down and there only there remained two in the midst there only remained two in the midst and it was the forgiver and the forgiven the forgiver and the forgiven listen if they would have recognized who was in their midst if they would have recognized the man that was there if they they too could have walked away not just ashamed but their heads up forgiven because the forgiver was amongst them the forgiver was there and yet they walked away ashamed you see Jesus said neither do I accuse you go and sin no more so he gave them both something to do he gave them both something to do to go and take that unbelief and sin out of their life you see because sometimes it's good sometimes we come in contact with the Healer but we must go on that's right we must go on right good because the that's just not the healing that we're looking for we're looking for healing of the Soul because from that time it starts something new because when you meet God from that time something is different right amen from that time your life is different it's not just as Christians that we can say from that time but it's us as human beings from that time is a time in place in your life that you make a decision a Time in a place that God comes on the scene or maybe it's a time that you know something goes bad in your life you can ask the drug addict out there you can ask the alcoholic you can ask ones out there what happened and they can point back to a moment that they can say from that time on this went happen from that time on I went down this path I remember the day that I chose this past I remember the day that I drank my first beer I remember the day that I did this this and from that time their life has changed forever but yet we it's not all things that we see in our natural element but yes sometimes from our from that time on we know when God comes in our life amen we can say from that time on God met me at the altar from that time on God met me there on that day and I was filled with the Holy Ghost and I was made a new man from that time on I was different you can put a stake in the ground and say from that time on I'm different and you can always take Satan back to that time and say this is the day that it changed my life yes sir we can read in our Bibles of this the woman at the well the woman at the well she had an appointment with God and from that time on he said I perceive that you have five husbands and the one you're with now is not your husband usband she says there's a messiah that's going to come and he's going to tell us these things and he says I am he what was it the revealed word of her hour coming to her what was it the very word coming the word being made flesh to her as the individual within that moment thank you Lord from time that time on we can look back in our lives and we see examp temples we can look at the two walking on the road to Emmas that they were walking and talking but yet from that time on God came on the scene he began to talk and expound unto them he began to give them Revelation and understanding of who he was and what they were looking for and from that time they walked differently we all have these moments in our lives but yet it's the difference of a moment you see the difference of a moment and a story that it never gets old is a thief on the cross the difference of a moment you see a man that lived his life contrary to everything that heaven is all about this man lived in sin he had unbelief he never did anything good and I'm sure as he hung there on the cross with only moments to live he only had a moment but yet this thief on the cross I wonder as he hung there he begin to wonder and he begin to question should I ask him should I ask him and I'm sure within his mind he begin to play now you're not worthy enough you haven't done anything good you don't deserve this what have you done to go where this man is going why would this man care about you and I'm sure doubt begin to set in his mind and I'm sure Jesus is sitting there and he's saying ask me anyway ask me anyway why because there was a deep on the inside of that man he never lived a good life never did anything for God yet within that moment Jesus is saying ask me anyway son ask me anyway I'll give what you have desire he says father will you remember me never repented never asked for forgiveness never did anything he just said remember me and he says you will be with me in Paradise you see one moment there was two thieves One Moment One chose Life One chose death the difference of a moment is what you do with that moment all right the difference of that moment will alter the course of your life amen and I'm sure as this thief as he crossed over and he began to go up to different ones and he began to shake the hands and I know you've heard the story and he begin to shake the hands of the different ones and they begin to say God bless you where are you from what church did you go to he says I've never went to church all right well well well did you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost no I i' never baptized well did you speak in tongues did you do something for God did you give him a glass of water what did you do that you earned your way to heaven and he says I did nothing well how did you get here how did you get here he said because the man in the middle said I could come you see it was just an invitation from the Middle the man in the middle gave him an invitation he had every right the man in the middle said I could come how many of us have received that invitation you see I don't have to wait until my deathbed until I'm laying there with no hope no thing right now I want to give my life for Jesus Christ I want to say God I want to serve you I want to live for you I want to do everything I can to make a difference the man in the middle said I could come how big is God's grace how big is God's mercy how big is God's love sometimes we take away from different people because we we see that they don't earn it or they don't deserve it but yet that's our human element speaking that's our human and time element that we begin to see and we look at these five senses around us and we begin to judge one another but yet the grace of God Is So Much Greater is so much more powerful than anything that we ever have than we can ever think you see this human element of God's grace and his mercy so much greater and I'm so thankful that I know and I have a personal relationship with the man in the middle amen yes sir that man has given an invitation that man is one that you can talk with and have fellowship with he Longs and desires to have fellowship with each one of us it's a daily Walk With Jesus Christ it's a daily love affair he longs to have fellowship with you the difference of a moment is what you do with that opportunity you see moments come and go and then it's just a memory it just becomes a part of our uh the history of our human and time element but I say let us redeem the time let us seize the moment that you were in because when God comes by when God is moving that is the time to redeem it amen because you don't know when the next time he's going to come by your way you don't know the next time you might have fellowship and he might come down and show himself to you yet he's still there but we must recognize when God is in our midst amen Jesus unrecognized is a wonderful service that brother Brandon preaches it breaks my heart every time because he says many times we miss our blessing because we don't recognize when he's walking amongst us maybe God is in your brother or sister sister maybe God is one in one another maybe he's there to reach out a hand he's there in in somebody maybe it's somebody in the church and God wants you to reach out and show compassion and love for that's what Christianity is all about is serving one another you see the moments with Christ are Eternal and they have eternal value as we read in our opening scripture that for our light affections but is which is just for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory while we look not at the things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which aren't seen are Eternal you see we have to stop looking at our these temporal things around us these temporal things around us can then begin to control the way we think the way we act the way we talk they're temporal things they're temporal situations but we must look to our Eternal God who knows all things amen and you know he has your best interest in mind that's right he has your best interest in mind that's right he wants the very best for you yeah sometimes it might not feel like it sickness might not feel like it's the best but sometimes that's what you need because why sometimes our trials is what brings God on the scene trials is what makes you closer to God why because you begin to pray more you begin to seek God more he gives us what we have need of not what we want amen the difference of a moment let's stand you see the difference of a moment one of these days in a moment and twinking of an eye amen we will be changed it's just going to take a moment let me ask you tonight what will you do with your moment what will you do with that moment will you seize that opportunity will you take advantage of that opportunity that God has given each one of us ah they come at different seasons they come at different points in our lives but yet I want to say I want to seize every moment that God has given us let us redeem the time for it is evil we are living in an evil time yes let us bow our heads father we're so so thankful than you Lord Lord for your grace and your mercy in our lives where Lord where would we be without you lord we just are a people that are in need of you father things have been said and Lord maybe some things have come across as condemning but lord it's not condemning but it's convicting our hearts that we can live better that we can do better that we can serve you more that within moments that you come by our way that father we can recognize when you're in our midst we can recognize the moving of the holy spirit because when the water is stirring when the water is moving is a time to get in it's a time to put our faith into action it's time to make a step toward you and oh God you see father that we're a people made of made up of this human element father full of faults and failures full of mistakes but Lord your grace is sufficient father you help us you lead us you guide us we know that Christian people we will have our faults and our failures God a Christian people isn't a perfect people but they're a forgiven people they know who they are they know where they come from and where they're going they know that they have eternal God that they can talk to they they can walk with they can ask they can seek and so father we're so thankful that we have this opportunity to be gathered in your house and father we just ask a special blessing upon your people Lord may you just continue to wrap your arms of compassion Lord there's many sick and Afflicted amongst us and the sickness going throughout the church and we're just asking that the healing oh God that would move through the church from the front to the back from those
