[45:59] 7 everybody look this way
[46:02] please new
[46:09] iPad but don't worry I've still got two
[46:11] spars in the
[46:13] back just in case that ever happens
[46:15] again don't get too nervous because all
[46:17] my quotes and scriptures are right here
[46:20] on the screen okay I understand we had
[46:22] to nearly call 45 ambulances on Sunday
[46:25] morning
[46:27] everybody was so nervous it ain't no
[46:30] wonder that devil was so mad is it did
[46:32] the Lord whoop him or what
[46:37] amen
[46:39] hallelujah oh we watch our God In
[46:42] Miracles and we watch him in healings
[46:44] and we watch him in things like that I
[46:46] love to watch him in
[46:49] battle that's right Revelation chapter 5
[46:55] we'll read why
[46:57] that it is well with our soul tonight
[47:00] how it can be what our Lord did and he
[47:04] came and took the book out of the right
[47:06] hand of him that sat upon the
[47:09] throne and when he had taken the book
[47:11] The Four beasts and the four and 20
[47:13] Elders fell down before the
[47:17] lamb now listen how many of them was
[47:20] there 4 and 20 so our Boaz has now gone
[47:26] before
[47:27] the
[47:28] witnesses at the
[47:30] gate having every one of them Harps and
[47:33] golden vials full of odors which are the
[47:35] prayers of the
[47:37] Saints and they sung a new
[47:41] song a new
[47:43] song that'll be what we'll be singing in
[47:46] heaven new songs we won't be singing
[47:50] I'll lay down my sword and shield Down
[47:54] by the Riverside won't be singing that
[47:56] one no
[47:58] more leave it
[48:00] there leave it there won't sing that one
[48:03] either we'll be singing new songs you
[48:07] imagine what it's going to be when
[48:09] Millions times millions of God's
[48:11] children will be singing and worshiping
[48:16] and praising through the ceaseless
[48:20] ages praise God and they sung a new song
[48:25] saying Thou Art Worthy worthy to take
[48:28] the book notice how the song is fitting
[48:32] to the action in
[48:34] heaven so the words of the song are
[48:38] fitted to the occasion Thou Art Worthy
[48:42] to take the book and to open the seals
[48:46] thereof for thou was slain and Hast
[48:50] redeemed us to God by thy blood out of
[48:53] every Kindred and tongue and people and
[48:59] nation and has made us unto our God
[49:04] Kings and Priests and we shall reign on
[49:10] the earth Lord hasten the day and me
[49:13] like to be remember tonight as we
[49:16] pray dear God we believe your word is
[49:20] true we realize we are closer today than
[49:25] any other generation that's ever been on
[49:27] the earth to that great event father as
[49:32] we Endeavor to look into your word
[49:34] tonight I pray that you would help each
[49:36] of us help me Lord that I can be able to
[49:39] get out of the way and speak only that
[49:42] which would be of benefit to your people
[49:45] Lord God I ask that you would help them
[49:48] Lord no doubt many of them have worked
[49:50] today and they've had a schedule to try
[49:53] to watch out for and a time to do this
[49:55] and a time to go there and maybe they've
[49:58] had a hassle getting to the house of God
[50:01] but may the presence of the Lord come in
[50:04] this place so arrest our thoughts our
[50:09] goals our motives our purposes Our
[50:12] intention pull us up into a realm in
[50:15] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus may we
[50:18] be able to receive from the mighty hand
[50:22] of God help them Lord to pull on the
[50:25] gift help me to surrender to the gift
[50:29] May the spirit of God come and take
[50:32] charge of this service when it comes to
[50:34] its close may we leave here saying
[50:38] within our hearts did not our hearts
[50:40] burn within us as he talked with us
[50:43] along the way would you grant it father
[50:46] in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray
[50:49] amen God bless you Saints you may be
[50:52] seated
[50:58] what a great parallel between Boaz and
[51:00] Ruth and our Boaz Christ Jesus and his
[51:04] beloved Bride As Boaz could not complete
[51:09] Redemption at the threshing floor
[51:13] remember the threshing floor was a very
[51:15] special place in the mind of Ruth a
[51:18] great thing happened there a great
[51:21] occasion and it was there that she
[51:23] reached up and grabbed a hold of His
[51:25] Garment and and pulled it down over her
[51:28] which was a sign of betral no doubt it
[51:32] would always be special it would be a
[51:36] place that would have dear fond memories
[51:39] to her and also to him it was there that
[51:43] he told her to take her veil which she
[51:46] had wrapped around her she spread it out
[51:48] and he took some of the barley and laid
[51:51] it down into the four corners of that
[51:54] and then sent her to her mother-in-law's
[51:56] house house to wait for the work of
[51:58] redemption great things happened there
[52:01] but yet Boaz could not complete the work
[52:06] of redemption at the threshing floor as
[52:09] great as the miracle was in canaa of
[52:13] Galilee when our lord Jesus turned water
[52:16] into wine as great as it was when the
[52:19] syro Phoenician woman came with her knee
[52:23] whenever the Roman Centurion came with
[52:26] with his neede other great places and
[52:29] I've stood there a couple of times in my
[52:31] life in many of those places and there's
[52:33] just something about standing there as
[52:35] we stood there the last time we were
[52:36] there and they had just recently found
[52:40] uh Simon the house where his
[52:43] mother-in-law laid and there was these
[52:45] old Stones right there beside the lake
[52:48] and quite amazing they' found the the
[52:51] original stones that were there over
[52:54] 2,000 years old that had been part of
[52:57] the synagogue of capernium and right
[52:59] from there within Rock throwing distance
[53:01] was where the house where Peter's
[53:03] mother-in-law lay and the Lord Jesus
[53:06] went there and touched her great events
[53:08] great things happened there and whenever
[53:11] you go through there and you realized
[53:12] there was all of those was part of
[53:15] making the story ruths finding Boaz and
[53:18] happing across the right field great
[53:21] events wonderful things but he could not
[53:25] complete the work of redemption at the
[53:28] field where he first met her he could
[53:31] not complete the work of redemption at
[53:33] the threshing floor as great as it was
[53:37] neither could our lord Jesus complete
[53:40] the work of redemption at the cross he
[53:44] could not complete it at the tomb never
[53:48] such an event had happened before like
[53:52] happened at the tomb on that
[53:54] Resurrection morning but yet that
[53:56] Redemption could not be completed at the
[54:00] cross Redemption could not be completed
[54:04] on that Resurrection morning when he
[54:06] raised and done this great Defiance
[54:10] against the kingdom of hell now I know
[54:13] that for some they look at that like
[54:15] brother Donnie why why would you say
[54:17] that it's because it's the truth all of
[54:20] those things are leading up of the steps
[54:23] into Redemption and we must follow God
[54:26] as God unfolds the steps I mean know the
[54:30] prophet even tells us in in those great
[54:32] works that there's two stages of it
[54:34] coming out and going into so the
[54:38] children of Israel came out of the land
[54:40] of redemption but their work of
[54:42] redemption was not finalized when they
[54:45] left sihon whenever they come out and
[54:47] they finally break beyond the pyramids
[54:49] and they finally go over and they come
[54:51] against OG and they come against Bashan
[54:54] and they come against those different
[54:55] ones they still had not received their
[54:58] full inheritance until they come back
[55:02] and they were the actual possessors of
[55:04] the land so Redemption truly has stages
[55:08] I want you to notice then so our lord
[55:11] Jesus when he died on the cross the
[55:14] blood the price had finally been
[55:17] submitted so God needed a currency by
[55:21] which the book of redemption could be
[55:24] purchased so it was was lost by a man
[55:28] who stood in perfect peace with God it
[55:32] was forfeited by a Son of God that was
[55:36] not a sinner forfeited by a Son of God
[55:40] who is in the correct image that God
[55:43] made him so there must be an exchange by
[55:47] which God can accept something back by
[55:50] which the transfer of the book can go
[55:53] back into the hands of men so Adam
[55:56] forfeited his rights to the title deed
[56:00] of the Earth the book of Redemption all
[56:03] of our names now remember your name was
[56:06] on that book then so when Adam had that
[56:10] book your name was written there and
[56:14] when he forfeited that then there must
[56:16] be a price that would be paid so it had
[56:20] to be more than a lamb it had to be more
[56:24] than chemistry of a blood it had to be
[56:27] more than just a good person a prophet
[56:30] couldn't do it righteous man couldn't do
[56:33] it so God had to make a currency which
[56:36] would be acceptable I'd like to go into
[56:39] it sometime if the Lord would let me
[56:41] how's that there was a Redemption money
[56:45] that was issued let me just give you a
[56:47] consensus of it real quick there was a
[56:49] Redemption money which was called a
[56:53] shackle of the Tabernacle and God
[56:56] instituted that because by him allowing
[57:00] the firstborn to live coming out of the
[57:02] first Exodus and God took all the
[57:05] firstborn of the Egyptians but God said
[57:09] I claim all the firstborn as mine so
[57:13] every firstborn son that opens the
[57:16] Matrix was the word that God used that
[57:19] son is mine so every firstborn of The
[57:23] Oxen of the cattle of the Sheep of the
[57:26] donkeys whatever they owned every one of
[57:29] them belonged to God now the reason was
[57:33] because God allowed the firstborn to
[57:36] live so if God allowed the firstborn to
[57:39] live you owe God this debt you see this
[57:43] is why I look at it and our lives as
[57:46] children of God God allowed me to live
[57:49] so I hold him everything I am and so do
[57:54] you now a lot of people don't see it
[57:56] that way they look as at Grace is that
[57:59] God gives them everything they know they
[58:01] owe nothing back to God they don't
[58:04] understand what the reconciliation is
[58:05] all about so they want to still live
[58:08] their own life do their own thing the
[58:09] way dress the way they want to dress
[58:11] talk the way they want to talk do
[58:12] whatever they want to do but they want
[58:14] to be recipients of Grace and then God
[58:17] basically gets nothing back I don't
[58:19] understand Redemption that way myself so
[58:21] God said because I've spared the
[58:24] firstborn all of your firstborn horn is
[58:26] mine now as we go on then when the
[58:29] levitical order is established and God
[58:32] is going to have a priesthood by which
[58:35] will be a substitute and When God says
[58:39] now I'll tell you what Moses I want you
[58:41] I'm going to take all the tribe of Levi
[58:43] and I will substitute a levite for the
[58:48] firstborn I want you to number all of
[58:52] the Levites so they number them and then
[58:55] they number number all of the firstborn
[58:58] well what they wound up with was a
[59:01] number that there was more firstborn
[59:04] than the were Levites so it would be
[59:07] like this so here's a levite there's one
[59:09] there's one there's one there's one well
[59:11] if a levite and you say well here's my
[59:13] son here's my son here's my son all
[59:16] right will you stand for him yes will
[59:18] you stand for him I will will you take
[59:21] his place will you take his place yes
[59:24] yes I will all right you come into the
[59:26] service of the Lord you can go home you
[59:31] are free because these Levites took your
[59:36] place but they wound up having more
[59:39] firstborn than they had Levites so now
[59:42] what are they going to do so God said I
[59:45] will set up an
[59:48] exchange and it will be according to the
[59:52] shekele of the Tabernacle now this is
[59:55] going to be be monetary value and God
[59:59] says I will take so much for each one of
[1:00:03] your firstborn so many shekels for each
[1:00:06] one so all the Levites that they had
[1:00:10] substituted for the firstborn and then
[1:00:12] they had so many left over God said all
[1:00:14] right now what you're going to have to
[1:00:16] do you're going to have to buy your
[1:00:19] firstborn from me because I own them so
[1:00:25] according to the Tabernacle now remember
[1:00:28] not of the shackle of the Romans the
[1:00:31] Roman dinardi or the other Turkish money
[1:00:34] or whatever it was but God made a
[1:00:37] special currency an allocation that was
[1:00:41] called the shekele of the Tabernacle or
[1:00:45] it was also called The Ransom money The
[1:00:50] Ransom money so if you wanted your
[1:00:53] firstborn son to come home with you and
[1:00:56] be your son and he could get married and
[1:00:59] he could inherit your land then you had
[1:01:02] to buy him from
[1:01:04] god wow so every one of them sons and
[1:01:09] totally up to Mom and Daddy and Mom and
[1:01:11] Daddy said I don't like that Rascal no
[1:01:14] way let him go on to serve God maybe he
[1:01:15] can do more with him than I can what if
[1:01:18] they didn't redeem him he was under
[1:01:21] obligation to go to the house of God
[1:01:24] carry water chop wood carry the tent
[1:01:27] carry the gold carry this that the other
[1:01:30] but if they wanted him in their home
[1:01:33] they had to redeem him so God had to
[1:01:36] make an acceptable currency don't you
[1:01:39] understand what God was foreshadowing in
[1:01:42] the substitutionary value of giving
[1:01:44] something because God knowing that there
[1:01:47] would be an age coming afterwards when
[1:01:49] the Gentiles would be come in that he
[1:01:52] must establish a Divine currency that
[1:01:55] would would be accepted because the
[1:01:57] levitical order is going to pass away
[1:01:59] I'm glad I ain't got a levite standing
[1:02:01] for me tonight ain't you glad you ain't
[1:02:03] got a preacher standing for you we ain't
[1:02:05] got no Pope we ain't got no Bishop we
[1:02:07] ain't got no hierarchy nowhere but God
[1:02:11] made a currency what was it another
[1:02:14] shekele of the Tabernacle the real
[1:02:18] Tabernacle of the Lord so God said then
[1:02:21] I will allow you to buy your firstborn
[1:02:24] back from me and I will set up the
[1:02:27] currency that I will receive for them
[1:02:31] and they will be yours now he's doing
[1:02:33] the same thing when it comes to our
[1:02:35] kinsman redeemer so God is going to make
[1:02:39] a currency that will be able to have a
[1:02:42] value that will be even more worse even
[1:02:46] more than what we would be that we would
[1:02:50] look at ourselves and others would look
[1:02:52] at us and say there's no way I'm worse
[1:02:54] the death of the Lord Jesus there's no
[1:02:57] way that I am worth all that it cost him
[1:03:00] but the way he looks at it you are so
[1:03:03] you see it's not so much the way we look
[1:03:05] at ourselves and we're constantly under
[1:03:09] evaluating ourselves because we're
[1:03:12] looking at our Humanity looking at our
[1:03:14] failures and our shortcomings and we all
[1:03:17] have them don't we and we look at us and
[1:03:20] then we look at the currency and we
[1:03:22] think there's no way the currency was
[1:03:25] pure the currency was holy the currency
[1:03:28] was righteous it was Sanctified and we
[1:03:30] say I'm not worthy I'm not worthy
[1:03:32] there's no way I can be worthy of that
[1:03:34] but he looks at you and said but I deem
[1:03:37] it worthy I deem you worth surprise that
[1:03:42] I must pay this is why the Bible says
[1:03:45] that he for Joy the joy that was set
[1:03:48] before him enduring the cross despising
[1:03:52] the shame what was the joy set before
[1:03:55] him you and your fellowship so he looked
[1:03:59] at what he must pay and he looked at
[1:04:02] what he would get back and to him it was
[1:04:05] well worth the cost now whenever he does
[1:04:10] that on the cross then the father God
[1:04:12] have now made an acceptable currency
[1:04:16] that could be received on your behalf
[1:04:20] now when the Lord Jesus goes out to the
[1:04:22] cross of course he becomes in
[1:04:24] transubstantiation for our sins and our
[1:04:27] sins is laid upon him now he dies out of
[1:04:30] the presence of God he dies to death not
[1:04:33] as of a righteous man but as a sinner so
[1:04:37] whenever he does that he goes down into
[1:04:41] Paradise for first he goes into the
[1:04:43] regions of the lost and there he
[1:04:45] preaches to the souls that were in
[1:04:48] prison which were sometime disobedient
[1:04:51] while the ark was being prepared now he
[1:04:55] haunts them with a message of
[1:04:58] Deliverance he goes on Down Deeper
[1:05:01] beyond that realm of that Fifth
[1:05:03] Dimension and he goes down into Hades or
[1:05:07] sheld itself and he knocks on the door
[1:05:10] and of course you know the story he
[1:05:12] reaches in and grabs the keys off the
[1:05:13] devil and then he slams the door shut
[1:05:17] and then he goes over to where Abraham
[1:05:20] Isaac Jacob Joseph Zachariah Malachi all
[1:05:23] the righteous were and then he sets them
[1:05:26] free Paradise is emptied out now
[1:05:30] whenever he comes back and he raises on
[1:05:34] the Easter morning on the third day now
[1:05:38] the currency is entering in to a
[1:05:42] receivable form you see father God could
[1:05:46] not receive the currency in the
[1:05:50] crucified form hanging on the cross the
[1:05:54] Lord Jesus could could not go by form of
[1:05:58] theophany directly into the gate
[1:06:03] directly into the presence of God do you
[1:06:06] understand he died out of the presence
[1:06:09] of God so that you and I on our death
[1:06:12] don't have
[1:06:13] to now don't get in your mind that the
[1:06:16] Lord Jesus went straight to heaven
[1:06:18] that's totally impossible our sins were
[1:06:21] upon him well don't look at me that way
[1:06:24] demonology part two parag 199 when I
[1:06:27] think of how that Jesus went to hell and
[1:06:29] God because of his sins sent him to hell
[1:06:34] now remember he never committed any sins
[1:06:36] but it's what he placed upon himself in
[1:06:39] order to become the currency that could
[1:06:42] be exchanged for you praise the Lord so
[1:06:46] he could not go straight into the
[1:06:49] presence of God so what's going to
[1:06:51] happen now he must have this pattern by
[1:06:55] which which he will Ascend into the gate
[1:06:58] but he doesn't go directly after his
[1:07:02] resurrection now watch this in John 20
[1:07:05] verse 16 now Here Comes Mary to the Lord
[1:07:08] Jesus Jesus saith unto her Mary she
[1:07:11] turned herself and saith unto him Roni
[1:07:16] which is to say master Jesus saith unto
[1:07:19] her touch me not touch me not now this
[1:07:25] verb means to fasten to so it's not just
[1:07:30] a momentary touch to word that you Reach
[1:07:33] Out And Touch somebody and then take
[1:07:35] your hand away but it is to grab a hold
[1:07:39] of and not let go now remember Mary sees
[1:07:44] her Lord so what she wants to do is
[1:07:48] cling to him in the way that she was
[1:07:52] used to now this look like the Lord
[1:07:56] Jesus but in one sense of the word it is
[1:08:01] but it ain't it ain't the same Lord
[1:08:04] Jesus that she knew as a human this is
[1:08:08] the glorified Lord Jesus but he must
[1:08:12] have looked like he did so much before
[1:08:15] that she couldn't tell the difference
[1:08:17] now we know he could appear in that way
[1:08:20] but it was so much like what she had
[1:08:22] known for these three years or three and
[1:08:24] a half years ever long it was that she
[1:08:27] reaches out to grab a hold of him which
[1:08:30] it was customary for the women to do and
[1:08:33] grab a hold of their Master the rabbi
[1:08:36] the raboni they would grab a hold of
[1:08:38] their feet and their legs at the bottom
[1:08:41] so she was reaching out to do the same
[1:08:44] thing but Jesus said Mary don't touch me
[1:08:49] touch me not was the words that he said
[1:08:53] so what is she doing she's now wanting
[1:08:56] to renew her old form of contact in the
[1:09:01] way that she knew Jesus before his death
[1:09:05] burial and Resurrection so this is how
[1:09:09] she knew him before sight sound and
[1:09:14] touch sight sound and touch so she's
[1:09:18] reaching out to reestablish this old way
[1:09:23] of communication by which knew him but
[1:09:27] Jesus is stopping her and saying now
[1:09:29] look Mary that this is not the time for
[1:09:33] that type of an experience because after
[1:09:37] my Ascension you will know me by faith
[1:09:42] through the spirit it will no longer be
[1:09:46] sight sound and touch don't you
[1:09:49] understand it must have been so hard for
[1:09:51] them to believe that the Lord Jesus is
[1:09:54] going to leave and they're not going to
[1:09:55] say him again that was the only thing
[1:09:57] they knew was the Corporal body so he's
[1:10:00] showing them Mary no no no don't touch
[1:10:02] me but now remember he's not just doing
[1:10:05] it for that way oh my may God help us
[1:10:08] that open our understanding Lord this
[1:10:09] communion will be possible after my
[1:10:13] Ascension now remember he's raised from
[1:10:15] the dead he's died for our sins paid the
[1:10:17] penalty and he's raised from the dead
[1:10:20] but he's not yet entered into to the
[1:10:23] anot type of Leviticus 7 16 and that is
[1:10:27] what the day of atonement for the day of
[1:10:31] atonement the high priest alone would
[1:10:33] enter in behind the veil into the shakai
[1:10:37] and as he would enter into the shakai go
[1:10:40] in and out of there seven times and
[1:10:43] change his garments each time he went in
[1:10:46] and come out and he would take blood
[1:10:48] first for himself and then for the sins
[1:10:51] of the people he had already taken one
[1:10:53] goat and released it and now he's killed
[1:10:56] the other one and he takes the blood in
[1:10:57] there and he is going to Bear the names
[1:11:00] of the children of Israel upon his
[1:11:03] breastplate each one of them has a stone
[1:11:06] and the presence of God would hit those
[1:11:08] stones and illuminate these beautiful
[1:11:11] iridescent colors so as he walked in
[1:11:14] before the presence of God he's bearing
[1:11:17] the names of the 12 tribes you were
[1:11:21] identified on his chest if you were a
[1:11:24] Jew if you're the tribe of napali of
[1:11:27] Ephraim of Manasseh of Judah of isachar
[1:11:31] of Reuben so on and so on that
[1:11:34] birthstone had your identity and when
[1:11:37] that priest walked in there he walked in
[1:11:40] there representing you and if God would
[1:11:43] accept him God Oh Glory would accept you
[1:11:48] now remember none of the children of
[1:11:51] Israel ever got to go in on the day of
[1:11:54] atonement not even the Levites not even
[1:11:57] the regular Priestly order only the high
[1:12:00] priest alone it is the high priest that
[1:12:04] is speaking to Mary touch me
[1:12:10] not oh
[1:12:12] Hallelujah as high priest he speaks to
[1:12:16] Mary and says don't touch me but what is
[1:12:19] the difference but the time that he
[1:12:21] tells her not to touch him when the
[1:12:24] disciples are gathered together again a
[1:12:26] few days later after this and Thomas had
[1:12:29] missed it and then they he appeared
[1:12:31] again and Thomas said I I'll not believe
[1:12:33] unless I put my hand I've got to touch
[1:12:36] them nail Prince boy I've got to put my
[1:12:38] hand in his side and Jesus walked right
[1:12:40] in and said come here Thomas you want to
[1:12:42] you want to touch me touch me handle me
[1:12:45] how in the world could he do that he had
[1:12:48] already taken the money up before the
[1:12:51] Throne of God now after it had been
[1:12:55] delivered and the ransom Oh Glory to God
[1:12:59] and the ransom money had been received
[1:13:02] now the exchange can start taking place
[1:13:06] for the liberated
[1:13:08] Souls thank you Lord Jesus now notice
[1:13:12] having accomplished the sacrifice he is
[1:13:16] now on his journey to present the blood
[1:13:21] up into the father's presence now what's
[1:13:24] he going to do he's going to bring the
[1:13:26] blood up before the father Before the
[1:13:30] Throne of God and even with that
[1:13:33] happening the seals are still not broke
[1:13:36] now notice at the path of redemption so
[1:13:38] he dies on the cross he sheds his blood
[1:13:42] he then goes down into the regions of
[1:13:44] the lost and and does what he does there
[1:13:46] then he raises back up on the third day
[1:13:49] ascends up to the father and Revelation
[1:13:52] 5 still was not broke open when he
[1:13:55] brought the blood before the father why
[1:13:58] not yet time remember Revelation 5
[1:14:01] follows after chapter 1 2 3 and four
[1:14:04] which is the revealing of the church
[1:14:07] ages look at how redemption's plan can
[1:14:10] span apart for thousands of years the
[1:14:13] Lord Jesus has been working on a gentile
[1:14:15] Bride for over 2,000 years getting them
[1:14:19] out of Germany getting them out of
[1:14:21] Africa getting them out of China
[1:14:23] Indonesia all around around the world
[1:14:26] calling and Gathering them working on
[1:14:28] them molding them shaping them and think
[1:14:31] of it we're in the last stages of that
[1:14:34] phase of
[1:14:35] redemption but I want you to notice what
[1:14:37] he goes on to say Jesus saith unto her
[1:14:40] touch me not for I am not yet
[1:14:45] ascended to my father but this is what I
[1:14:49] want you to do but go
[1:14:52] to my brethren
[1:14:57] I want you to understand the Lord Jesus
[1:15:00] had referred to his followers as
[1:15:04] disciples he even referred to them as
[1:15:08] friends in St John 15:15 I believe it is
[1:15:11] referred to them as
[1:15:13] friends but he had never called them
[1:15:16] brothers
[1:15:19] yet so with his raising from the dead
[1:15:23] and on his way to bring the Redemption
[1:15:26] money he goes ahead and lets out a
[1:15:29] family
[1:15:30] secret glory to
[1:15:33] God but go
[1:15:35] to my
[1:15:38] brethren and say unto them I
[1:15:43] ascended glory to God unto my
[1:15:47] father and your
[1:15:49] father to my
[1:15:51] God and your God
[1:15:55] now watch what he's showing to Mary a
[1:15:57] new
[1:15:59] relationship will begin after my
[1:16:04] Ascension the Redemption money that I
[1:16:07] will pay which is what
[1:16:11] himself so when he walks into the
[1:16:14] presence of spirit God before the
[1:16:17] justice of his small the full
[1:16:22] account is settled right then and
[1:16:26] there glory to God the full account your
[1:16:31] full price was paid right there because
[1:16:35] when father God saw him in that
[1:16:39] resurrected form the resurrected form is
[1:16:42] your sign that your price has been paid
[1:16:46] just the human form of the Lord Jesus
[1:16:49] was not the sign that it had been paid
[1:16:52] it was the sign it was going to be but
[1:16:54] the res resurrected Son of God was the
[1:16:57] sign that father had been pleased with
[1:17:00] him he went down and died with that
[1:17:03] death upon him and the curse of the law
[1:17:05] but when he raised from the dead I am he
[1:17:09] that was dead but I am alive forever
[1:17:13] more notice how Paul picks this up in
[1:17:15] Hebrews chapter 2:1 for both he that
[1:17:19] sanctifies and they who are Sanctified
[1:17:22] are all of one of which because he is
[1:17:26] not ashamed to call them Brethren verse
[1:17:30] 12 saying I will declare thy name unto
[1:17:35] my brethren in the midst of the church I
[1:17:39] don't know how Jesus is going to do that
[1:17:41] believe Jesus don't believe in going to
[1:17:42] church do you so apparently Jesus
[1:17:44] believes in going to church then when
[1:17:46] you get to church Jesus is going to come
[1:17:48] among you and Jesus is going to declare
[1:17:51] the name of Father God well praise the
[1:17:54] Lord God goes to church in the midst of
[1:17:59] the church will I sing praise unto thee
[1:18:02] verse 17 wherefore in All Saints it
[1:18:05] behooved him to be made like unto his
[1:18:11] Brethren you imagine he's calling them
[1:18:13] Brethren before they ever got saved well
[1:18:18] Hallelujah he's calling them Brethren it
[1:18:21] behooved him to be made like to his
[1:18:24] Brethren why so his Brethren could be
[1:18:27] made like unto him but you see the order
[1:18:31] of redemption is he must be made like us
[1:18:34] first before we can be made like him so
[1:18:38] if he has been made like me then there
[1:18:41] is a promise with the Vindication of his
[1:18:44] resurrection I shall be made like him
[1:18:47] and John says for it does not yet appear
[1:18:49] what we shall be but we know that when
[1:18:51] he shall appear we shall be like him for
[1:18:55] we shall see him as he
[1:18:59] is oh my that he might be a merciful and
[1:19:02] faithful high priest in things
[1:19:05] pertaining to God to make reconciliation
[1:19:09] for the
[1:19:10] sins of the people so now he
[1:19:14] unveils part of the family plan to make
[1:19:18] real true Holy Ghost filled
[1:19:22] Believers part of the family
[1:19:25] of Father
[1:19:26] God Jesus sath unto her touch me not for
[1:19:30] I'm not yet ascended to my father but go
[1:19:32] to my brethren and say unto them I
[1:19:34] Ascend unto my father notice how he says
[1:19:38] this my father and your father wonder
[1:19:41] why he doesn't just say our
[1:19:44] father when he was teaching them how to
[1:19:47] pray before the
[1:19:49] resurrection he says say these words Our
[1:19:53] Father which art in heaven
[1:19:55] Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[1:19:58] right you know the story but now after
[1:20:01] the resurrection before the Ascension
[1:20:04] and the blood being laid upon the altar
[1:20:06] of atonement then what does he do he
[1:20:09] introduces a position to his new
[1:20:12] Believers that's going to be filled with
[1:20:14] the Holy Ghost and he brings them right
[1:20:16] on the plateau and standing right there
[1:20:20] by
[1:20:23] him my father father and your father my
[1:20:27] God and your
[1:20:30] God I wish at least one person would get
[1:20:33] that Revelation tonight you'll tear up
[1:20:35] hell if you do you'll never be the same
[1:20:38] person
[1:20:39] again notice this my father and your
[1:20:44] father I wonder what the disciples
[1:20:47] thought whenever Sister Mary come in
[1:20:50] said Brothers I want to let y'all know
[1:20:53] I've seen Jesus yeah right sure if he
[1:20:55] was going to appear to anybody he appear
[1:20:56] to us
[1:20:57] preachers or deacons or trustees he sure
[1:21:00] would appear to no woman I mean had
[1:21:02] appeared to the men men run the
[1:21:05] church well come on Brothers don't sit
[1:21:07] there and just smile at
[1:21:09] me notice so he appears to a woman and
[1:21:14] then he gives the woman this word now
[1:21:18] she's not called to preach of course but
[1:21:20] he gives her this salutation to bring
[1:21:23] back to his brothers of such
[1:21:27] incomparable incomparable
[1:21:29] Glory that that it would take it would
[1:21:32] take years do you understand this Glory
[1:21:36] that he spoke over 2,000 years ago is
[1:21:40] still trying to be
[1:21:43] comprehended how many through the church
[1:21:45] ages understood these few words I wonder
[1:21:49] how many sitting in this building
[1:21:50] tonight do
[1:21:54] words of incomparable Glory Jesus had
[1:21:59] habitually called God his father and on
[1:22:03] the cross is
[1:22:08] God but the disciples had
[1:22:15] not but watch Jesus as he
[1:22:18] merges
[1:22:19] father
[1:22:22] God father
[1:22:26] God
[1:22:28] hallelujah father
[1:22:31] God he is my father and he's yours he's
[1:22:36] my God and he's yours so you're not
[1:22:41] separate you're not separate from the
[1:22:45] the beginning of the creation of God so
[1:22:49] if you could get it in your mind there
[1:22:50] on the circle of Eternity before there
[1:22:52] was any stars molecules Adam or light no
[1:22:55] stars no nothing nothing like that and
[1:22:57] there he was he wanted to project
[1:22:58] himself and he wanted to condens sin and
[1:23:01] make himself more apparent he wanted to
[1:23:04] become a human he wanted to express all
[1:23:07] that he was and there was nothing above
[1:23:10] him he couldn't go any higher so he
[1:23:12] wanted to expand himself I said we can
[1:23:14] do that because we're we're constantly
[1:23:17] expanding we're learning more we're
[1:23:18] doing more we think tomorrow well I you
[1:23:20] know I'm going to do this and then by
[1:23:21] the end of the week we're saying I wish
[1:23:23] I done it that well wish i' done this
[1:23:24] would save me two hours work because
[1:23:26] we're constantly learning but he could
[1:23:28] not learn anymore there was nothing
[1:23:31] greater there was nothing higher there
[1:23:33] was nothing any more powerful there was
[1:23:35] nothing any more lovable but yet he
[1:23:37] still wanted to expand himself so he
[1:23:39] couldn't go no higher so the only way to
[1:23:41] expand himself was go down go down to
[1:23:45] the act of condensation he must come
[1:23:47] down so he starts creating toward the
[1:23:50] lower forms of life and in the beginning
[1:23:53] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:23:55] and the Word was God and the same as in
[1:23:57] the beginning with God all things were
[1:23:59] created by Him without him was not
[1:24:00] anything made that was made so he went
[1:24:02] down not up no wonder the prophet said
[1:24:06] the Way Up Is Down we still got it
[1:24:09] backwards so what did God do he went
[1:24:12] down
[1:24:13] down hallelujah hallelujah so he started
[1:24:18] in the act of condensation so in the
[1:24:20] beginning was the word but what was
[1:24:23] before the
[1:24:25] beginning that's when Moses picks it up
[1:24:27] Genesis 1:1 in the beginning was the
[1:24:29] word John 1:1 and the Word was made
[1:24:31] fleshly say in verse 14 so what was
[1:24:33] before the beginning the
[1:24:36] Eternal the
[1:24:38] Eternal but when time
[1:24:41] began
[1:24:43] was the
[1:24:45] word and the word become into a form
[1:24:49] that had we been there we've been able
[1:24:51] to seen it so it's like a little
[1:24:54] white light playing around the father's
[1:24:58] door a condescended form of the great
[1:25:03] Eternal now he always wanted to reveal
[1:25:07] himself and he thought of you and he
[1:25:09] thought of me and he thought of a
[1:25:11] universe and he thought of planets and
[1:25:13] stars and so on and believe it or not he
[1:25:16] thought of himself as being a
[1:25:20] human that's all I've been my 67 years
[1:25:23] and I can't wait to become something
[1:25:25] else but he thought of
[1:25:28] himself as being a
[1:25:31] human but now don't get in your mind
[1:25:34] that the end of his thought was just
[1:25:36] living those 33 and A2 years on the
[1:25:39] earth he was thinking of himself in this
[1:25:42] Loop of time of that part of his journey
[1:25:46] but also when he come down to death and
[1:25:48] resurrection that he would continue to
[1:25:51] live in a human form through eternity
[1:25:53] you see whenever we look there in the
[1:25:55] great City and John said I saw one that
[1:25:57] W to set upon the throne and we know
[1:25:59] that in the eth day when we gather there
[1:26:01] in the New Jerusalem comes down from God
[1:26:03] out of heaven and there will be the
[1:26:05] embodiment of God's love the purchase
[1:26:08] money setting on the throne it will be
[1:26:10] the human body the Lord Jesus that will
[1:26:14] constant be going up before our Joseph
[1:26:17] and where will the father be well father
[1:26:19] God's not an old man that sits upon a
[1:26:21] great big Throne you know and sent over
[1:26:22] in Jesus his little boy sent down on the
[1:26:24] other side but the father God Jesus said
[1:26:27] God is a spirit first Timothy Paul says
[1:26:30] now unto the king Eternal Immortal the
[1:26:33] only wise God be glory and Dominion
[1:26:36] forever and ever is that right so what
[1:26:39] is the father it will be that light
[1:26:42] which will hover over the Sun so when we
[1:26:45] go to approach in his presence in the
[1:26:48] eth day the Corporal body that God
[1:26:51] thought about himself dwelling in but
[1:26:54] there was any time will be setting right
[1:26:57] there on his throne and you and I will
[1:27:00] approach it we'll go in and out and we
[1:27:03] will live it will be a continuation of
[1:27:06] this same life why because God paid the
[1:27:10] price and God made a shekele that was
[1:27:15] tangible that he could receive payment
[1:27:18] for our
[1:27:20] souls oh my notice so that both out
[1:27:24] together father
[1:27:26] God I love addressing him that way in
[1:27:32] prayer
[1:27:34] father
[1:27:37] God what an
[1:27:39] awesome privilege given to us as
[1:27:44] Mortals oh many Christians can call him
[1:27:47] the father of our Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:27:51] that is scripture but it's also
[1:27:53] scripture to say he is my
[1:27:58] father of which he is not ashamed I'm
[1:28:01] going to blow you away I know the Lord
[1:28:05] Jesus can look at my regenerated soul
[1:28:09] and if he was here tonight he could put
[1:28:11] his arm around me and look me in the
[1:28:14] face and say my
[1:28:19] brother my sister my brother my sister
[1:28:25] for his mother was standing outside one
[1:28:28] day when he was teaching and some of
[1:28:30] them came unto him and said your mother
[1:28:32] and your brothers are outside and they
[1:28:35] want to see thee he said who is my
[1:28:38] mother and my brothers but those who
[1:28:41] keep now watch what he's doing he's
[1:28:43] giving he doesn't say they are yet but
[1:28:45] he's giving an insight to what's going
[1:28:47] to happen those that obey the word they
[1:28:50] become burst into the family of God am
[1:28:55] don't you understand Jehovah did not
[1:28:57] want to live millions of miles away as
[1:28:59] it were or in another dimension from his
[1:29:02] people he wanted to live in the world we
[1:29:05] live
[1:29:06] in now watch he doesn't say it in a way
[1:29:10] to make us to where that we are some
[1:29:13] other race some other species or some
[1:29:18] other kind but children you look at it
[1:29:22] this way say
[1:29:24] my father and your father my God and
[1:29:29] your God and when you pray I give you my
[1:29:33] name you are my Representatives you are
[1:29:37] my
[1:29:38] ambassadors as a matter of fact you are
[1:29:42] me in another
[1:29:45] form Hallelujah notice this in souls and
[1:29:49] prison now you see in this book was what
[1:29:51] was redeemed it was the book of
[1:29:53] redemption and everything that he had
[1:29:56] redeemed was written in that book all
[1:29:58] that he died for was written in the book
[1:30:01] and he could not leave his mediatorial
[1:30:03] seat until he thoroughly redeemed and he
[1:30:08] couldn't redeem
[1:30:10] it at the
[1:30:13] cross don't you see why Satan wants
[1:30:16] millions of Christians to stop at the
[1:30:21] cross
[1:30:24] the majority of Christian preachers they
[1:30:28] never go any farther yes
[1:30:31] sir that's all they preach that's all
[1:30:34] they talk about why that's all they
[1:30:39] know so it takes a man who's went
[1:30:42] through the cross to the Redemption
[1:30:45] money to come back and tell you hey
[1:30:48] there's more to
[1:30:49] this than two pieces of wood aren't you
[1:30:53] glad God send us such men down to the
[1:30:55] ages seven Church age Messengers and
[1:30:58] then men out from under their Ministry
[1:31:00] are burst by the same spirit of God
[1:31:03] Anointed with the same Holy Ghost now
[1:31:05] watch he could not redeem it at the
[1:31:08] cross because they were predestinated in
[1:31:10] the Lamb's Book of Life and he had to
[1:31:12] stay on there to make intercessions
[1:31:15] where on the mercy seat so he ass sends
[1:31:18] up Mary backs off leaves him alone she's
[1:31:21] probably startled about don't know what
[1:31:22] to believe and then then whenever she
[1:31:24] goes and Jesus descends up somehow in
[1:31:27] that time he transition Goes Up Before
[1:31:29] the Throne of God and when he walks into
[1:31:32] the throne room oh Hallelujah and the
[1:31:35] justice of God is
[1:31:37] met then he can say father I'm going to
[1:31:41] go back down and save my brothers for a
[1:31:43] bit I'm going to have a little
[1:31:45] fellowship with them oh Hallelujah I'm
[1:31:48] going to eat a little fish with them eat
[1:31:50] a little
[1:31:51] hakes amen I I want to I want to go down
[1:31:54] there and spend a little time with my
[1:31:55] brothers I love them I miss them I want
[1:31:58] to be with them I want to I want to tell
[1:32:00] them what to look for now so that they
[1:32:02] can go ahead and be burst in the family
[1:32:05] because I have presented myself to you
[1:32:09] so the way has been made clear and their
[1:32:12] debt Oh Glory to God their debt is paid
[1:32:15] so on the day of Pentecost which will be
[1:32:17] 40 days after his Ascension of course
[1:32:20] when Pentecost means 50 so this is the
[1:32:23] Feast of the in gathering and when the
[1:32:26] day of Pentecost was fully come they
[1:32:29] were in one place and one mind and one
[1:32:32] Accord which is a miracle within itself
[1:32:33] ain't it and there come a sound as of a
[1:32:36] rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all
[1:32:39] the house where they were sitting and
[1:32:41] clothing tongues like as a fire set upon
[1:32:45] each of them and they begin to speak
[1:32:48] with other tongues as the spirit of God
[1:32:51] gave them utterance come on somebody
[1:32:54] don't you understand what happened the
[1:32:56] Lord God sent down their deposit
[1:32:59] Hallelujah your price has been paid come
[1:33:03] on in brother Peter come on in brother
[1:33:06] James come on in brother John amen they
[1:33:09] are now full-fledged
[1:33:19] Sons but now
[1:33:21] remember he didn't leave The Mercy Seat
[1:33:25] on the day of
[1:33:27] Pentecost and take the seven seal
[1:33:30] book still remain in the hands of Father
[1:33:37] God watch what he says he couldn't do it
[1:33:39] he couldn't redeem it at the cross
[1:33:41] because it predestinated the Lamb's Book
[1:33:42] of Life and he had to stay on there to
[1:33:44] make
[1:33:46] intercessions until that
[1:33:48] last
[1:33:50] person I'm glad he would do it that way
[1:33:53] in case it'd be me me or you or you or
[1:33:55] you or you might be one of my
[1:33:58] granddaughters might be some of my
[1:33:59] family it might be some of yours aren't
[1:34:01] you glad well he said well I've got all
[1:34:03] these people here what does one matter
[1:34:05] one matters one matters to the Lord God
[1:34:09] there won't be one I don't care who they
[1:34:11] are I don't care how long he has to beat
[1:34:13] the fire out of them until they get them
[1:34:14] where they need to be he's going to get
[1:34:15] them so if you're here tonight and
[1:34:17] you're not where you need to be if I as
[1:34:19] you just go ahead and get in cuz he will
[1:34:20] get you cuz he's greater than you are
[1:34:23] he's got more power than the devil's got
[1:34:25] he's got more power than alcohol he's
[1:34:27] got more power than drug addiction he's
[1:34:30] got more power than the things of the
[1:34:31] world and he will sit on that motorial
[1:34:34] bench until that last one is finished
[1:34:37] not just saved
[1:34:41] finished until that last
[1:34:44] person was
[1:34:51] finished praise God
[1:34:55] God you imagine this beautiful piece of
[1:34:58] Walnut right
[1:35:01] here when it first busted up out of the
[1:35:04] ground a little tiny
[1:35:06] Shute out of a walnut seed that may be a
[1:35:09] squirrel planted in the
[1:35:11] fall it took it years and years and
[1:35:15] years to be able to grow to get these
[1:35:17] tree rings I'm looking right now and
[1:35:19] seeing the age rings and one of the
[1:35:21] knots on this board took years years and
[1:35:26] years remember brother John went over
[1:35:28] and found it talked to a guy we needed
[1:35:31] so much board feet for this and this and
[1:35:33] all this other stuff it's rough has to
[1:35:37] be plained has to be straight edged
[1:35:39] brother John has to take glue it put it
[1:35:43] together brother Donnie stained
[1:35:45] it brother D brother Dan finished
[1:35:51] it all the years of work
[1:35:54] all the years that that Warner Tree
[1:35:56] struggle through the storms trying to
[1:35:59] hold its ground keep from getting blowed
[1:36:01] out of the ground and it struggled and
[1:36:04] it
[1:36:05] struggled look what it turned out to be
[1:36:08] hallelujah look at you struggling with
[1:36:11] this struggling with that ups and downs
[1:36:13] and ins and outs and one trial after
[1:36:16] another this ain't nothing compared to
[1:36:18] what you're going to be when you're
[1:36:20] finished oh hallelujah oh my you look at
[1:36:24] the things that God and his wisdom
[1:36:26] allows us to go through but you think
[1:36:28] Lord will I ever get there you will
[1:36:31] because God has ordained it and nothing
[1:36:34] will stop you from reaching that
[1:36:37] place oh
[1:36:40] my notice in Hebrews 9:22 and almost all
[1:36:44] things are by the law purged with blood
[1:36:48] and without the shedding of blood there
[1:36:50] is no remission it was therefore
[1:36:52] necessary that the patterns of the
[1:36:54] things in the heavens should be purified
[1:36:58] with these but the Heavenly things
[1:37:00] themselves with better sacrifices than
[1:37:04] these 1 Timothy 2:5 for there is one God
[1:37:08] and one
[1:37:11] mediator look at the meaning of this
[1:37:13] word one who
[1:37:15] intervenes between two e either in order
[1:37:19] to make or restore peace and friendship
[1:37:24] a form a compact or
[1:37:28] ratifying a covenant a medium of
[1:37:34] communication an
[1:37:37] arbitrator so an arbitrator is used many
[1:37:41] times when there are legal disputes and
[1:37:44] it can save it from going to a courtroom
[1:37:47] because an arbitrator is one that can
[1:37:49] stand between this party and that party
[1:37:51] and is not biased supposedly where they
[1:37:53] can be able to read the law and say well
[1:37:55] the law said this and you left this word
[1:37:57] out in your contract and you didn't say
[1:37:59] that no you misunderstood the contract
[1:38:01] you thought it meant this and that so
[1:38:03] the arbitrator can come out with a
[1:38:06] decision the Lord Jesus walked in and
[1:38:09] said I am the great
[1:38:12] emancipator I am the arbitrator I am the
[1:38:16] establisher of the Divine Covenant I am
[1:38:20] the purchaser of my brethren I am here
[1:38:24] to settle their debts I declare they are
[1:38:29] free forever more I declare hallelujah
[1:38:34] hallelujah they are mine I am theirs and
[1:38:38] we are yours father they come from you
[1:38:42] the same way I come from you and you
[1:38:45] love them even as you loved
[1:38:51] me can you believe that
[1:38:54] he loves
[1:38:56] me the same way he loved the Lord
[1:39:02] Jesus on mindboggling
[1:39:05] right we need help Lord there is only
[1:39:08] one God in one mediator between God and
[1:39:11] man
[1:39:13] the
[1:39:16] oh so the
[1:39:19] mediator had to be a man not only be one
[1:39:23] but remain
[1:39:25] one now notice Paul this is years after
[1:39:28] his resurrection so now he's referring
[1:39:32] to the glorified man you see because of
[1:39:35] our Humanity we so look down on man but
[1:39:39] you're looking at the Fallen man God
[1:39:42] looks at the raised man you understand
[1:39:43] the prophet tells us it will be eternal
[1:39:48] life in a human body
[1:39:54] wouldn't it be
[1:39:56] something that you never got
[1:39:59] old you never had an ache or of
[1:40:02] pain you never got
[1:40:05] tired you ever realize the houses in
[1:40:09] heaven won't have
[1:40:12] beds there'll be no lazy boys
[1:40:15] brother so get up you lazy
[1:40:17] boys get about your father's
[1:40:20] business we will not be tired we will
[1:40:25] never set up there in heaven with our
[1:40:28] head down in our hand oh oh I don't know
[1:40:31] what I'm going to do I I don't know how
[1:40:33] that'll never be there'll never be one
[1:40:35] person walk down those streets of gold
[1:40:37] with the first moment of sadness we'll
[1:40:41] feel no sorrow no heaviness Lord
[1:40:43] children just by those who have dreams
[1:40:45] and those who are carried beyond the
[1:40:47] curon of time and see all those people
[1:40:49] over in there in that sixth Dimension
[1:40:51] I've never yet heard anybody talk about
[1:40:54] them people of our crying them being sad
[1:40:57] wore out but they're running they're
[1:40:59] rejoicing they're smiling they're
[1:41:01] laughing why because they cannot be sad
[1:41:05] there no sadness is allowed no sorrow is
[1:41:10] allow and yet what kind of world will
[1:41:13] that be when we come back to this Earth
[1:41:16] because the Lord Jesus also paid the
[1:41:19] price for this Earth this Earth is going
[1:41:22] in the full cycle of redemption as well
[1:41:25] you say why don't he destroy it and make
[1:41:27] a new and he
[1:41:29] can't her
[1:41:31] name is in the Book of
[1:41:36] Life show me where the Bible mentions
[1:41:40] Pluto show me where the Bible mentions
[1:41:44] Saturn
[1:41:46] Neptune
[1:41:49] Mars but the Earth's name is in the Book
[1:41:54] of
[1:41:55] Life she is a redeemable attribute of
[1:41:59] God he cannot throw her
[1:42:03] away
[1:42:04] hallelujah hallelujah oh she Bears the
[1:42:08] scars of her past yes sir I just saw a
[1:42:11] picture today of a diver that was down
[1:42:13] in Florida if you can imagine it down in
[1:42:16] waters there off the coast of
[1:42:20] Florida going around digging for you
[1:42:22] know different and things whatever he
[1:42:23] could find and and much to his
[1:42:27] surprise he drew up a madon
[1:42:33] Tusk three boys just a while back in the
[1:42:37] in the South
[1:42:39] Dakota dug up and found a
[1:42:44] dinosaur what is it it's the Earth's
[1:42:47] geological record of her
[1:42:50] past but one day all them dinosaur bones
[1:42:54] and all them Mastadon Bones the fire of
[1:42:57] God will come down and burn so deep it
[1:43:00] will destroy oh Hallelujah all of her
[1:43:03] old record just like it did to you when
[1:43:06] you were filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:43:08] the Lord God annihilated your old book
[1:43:11] and destroyed that old record of your
[1:43:14] geological past and God said you are my
[1:43:17] son you are my daughter I never remember
[1:43:21] you cursing I never remember you
[1:43:23] drinking I never remember you running
[1:43:26] around all I remember is you as my
[1:43:30] child Hallelujah I am your father I am
[1:43:35] your
[1:43:36] [Applause]
[1:43:40] God
[1:43:43] hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus Hebrews
[1:43:45] 886 but now hasth he obtained more
[1:43:50] excellent Ministry
[1:43:53] but how much also he is the mediator of
[1:43:56] a better Covenant which was established
[1:43:58] upon better promises Romans
[1:44:02] 8:34 who is he that condemn us it is
[1:44:06] Christ that died yeay rather that is
[1:44:09] risen again who's even at the right hand
[1:44:11] of God who also maketh
[1:44:14] intercession for us I love the prophets
[1:44:18] in it this way the Bible said Jesus
[1:44:20] Christ is the same yesterday and forever
[1:44:22] he's a high priest sitting there make an
[1:44:23] intercession Upon Our confession we have
[1:44:27] to confess it first you're sick tonight
[1:44:31] confess it he's my healer you're bound
[1:44:34] by a besetting sin confess it tonight
[1:44:37] you devil you have no right you have no
[1:44:39] claim on my life get under my feet
[1:44:42] that's where you
[1:44:43] [Applause]
[1:44:44] belong we have to confess it first
[1:44:47] before he can be the high priest because
[1:44:50] he only intercedes
[1:44:54] to our confession yes can you believe
[1:44:57] that he only
[1:44:59] intercedes to what he hears us
[1:45:02] say so if we say I'm no good I'm
[1:45:06] worthless I have no value he cannot
[1:45:10] intercede on that
[1:45:13] confession but if you say I was
[1:45:16] worthless but he considered me worth a
[1:45:18] price now he says now I can say what
[1:45:21] you're saying I was no good but he
[1:45:24] changed me I was unrighteous but now I'm
[1:45:26] the righteousness of God in him by his
[1:45:29] stripes I'm already healed the doctor
[1:45:32] don't give me much hope but that ain't
[1:45:34] what Jesus said I I know what the
[1:45:36] doctor's report is but I believe there's
[1:45:39] another report by his stripes ye are
[1:45:42] already healed then he goes to work on
[1:45:46] your
[1:45:47] confession Oh my he only intercedes Upon
[1:45:51] Our confession what we
[1:45:54] confess that he is what he has done for
[1:45:58] us not what he will do Oh
[1:46:02] my he has already done it
[1:46:06] already we have to confess that he's
[1:46:09] done it we he wounded for our
[1:46:12] transgressions with his stripes we were
[1:46:15] healed you know I feel so sorry for
[1:46:17] those folks are in our ranks that feel
[1:46:19] like intercession is over man I'd hate
[1:46:22] to think I'd live a today on this life
[1:46:23] without the Lord Jesus interceding for
[1:46:25] me how many you good Holy Ghost people
[1:46:28] that love Jesus with all your heart have
[1:46:30] needed intercession since
[1:46:34] Sunday come on be
[1:46:39] honest watch says we absolutely know the
[1:46:42] infinite God predestinated all things by
[1:46:44] his for knowledge before the foundation
[1:46:47] of the world even the lamb was slain and
[1:46:50] every name that would ever be on the
[1:46:53] book was on the book before the book was
[1:46:55] ever written your name was on the book
[1:46:57] before the book was ever written your
[1:47:00] name was on the book before the book was
[1:47:02] ever written your name was on the book
[1:47:05] before the book was ever written that
[1:47:07] sounds like a mighty God will your name
[1:47:11] was on the book before the book was ever
[1:47:13] written your name was on the book before
[1:47:16] the book was ever written your name was
[1:47:18] on the book before the book was ever
[1:47:21] written that sounds like a Mighty God
[1:47:25] where ain't no devil in hell can stop
[1:47:28] you Ain no devil in hell can stop you
[1:47:33] ain't no devil in hell can stop you that
[1:47:36] sounds like a mighty
[1:47:45] God let's
[1:47:48] stand and Jesus came to redeem those
[1:47:50] that were in the book
[1:47:53] in the Bible the lamb came from behind
[1:47:55] the
[1:47:56] curtain and taken the book and opened
[1:47:59] the seals that it was sealed with for he
[1:48:01] come to claim all he had
[1:48:03] redeemed he's the intercessor now an
[1:48:06] intercessor making intercession for
[1:48:08] those he has redeemed all those whose
[1:48:12] names are written on the Lamb's Book of
[1:48:15] Life is
[1:48:17] redeemed go wait Jesus every name that
[1:48:19] was ever put on that book Jesus came to
[1:48:22] redeem
[1:48:23] and when the last's name is redeemed the
[1:48:27] book is
[1:48:29] closed now he didn't intend that no one
[1:48:32] be lost but his forign knowledge let him
[1:48:34] know who would be lost therefore he
[1:48:37] could predestinate and then their names
[1:48:39] is put on the book then when that book
[1:48:41] of redemption is closed seal with Seven
[1:48:45] Seals why it's being worked out by the
[1:48:51] mysterious power of
[1:48:55] God and
[1:48:57] someday the book of
[1:49:00] redemption is
[1:49:02] finished
[1:49:04] ah and the lamb takes it then the last
[1:49:08] name is called off of that the lamb
[1:49:11] comes forward to call what he has
[1:49:14] redeemed that's his
[1:49:16] church and I believe the time is
[1:49:21] close as
[1:49:23] hand amen
[1:49:27] hallelujah
[1:49:31] hallelujah and now if you were in the
[1:49:33] quickening at his
[1:49:38] beginning if you were in the quickening
[1:49:41] at his
[1:49:43] beginning that's what he come to redeem
[1:49:45] and your name was put on the Lamb's Book
[1:49:47] of Life in his
[1:49:49] thinking at the beginning
[1:49:53] if you were in the
[1:49:55] quickening at his beginning now remember
[1:49:58] we were not children like
[1:50:00] little babies around the Throne of God
[1:50:03] or even mature Sons and Daughters of God
[1:50:06] but we were
[1:50:07] Sals in his
[1:50:11] mind if you can receive
[1:50:14] it you were at his
[1:50:17] beginning when he was quickened in the
[1:50:20] form of the condescended word in his
[1:50:24] thinking you were
[1:50:27] quickened with
[1:50:31] him praise
[1:50:35] God and your name was put on the Lamb's
[1:50:38] Book of Life and his thinking and he
