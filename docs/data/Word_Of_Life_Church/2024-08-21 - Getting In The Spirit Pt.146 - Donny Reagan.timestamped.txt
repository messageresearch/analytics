[32:42] your works and my works and your mama
[32:45] and your daddy and the church Christ
[32:49] alone that's the way we're
[32:51] righteous let's turn to Matthew 24
[32:56] tonight Matthew Matthew
[32:58] 24 verse 26 through verse
[33:06] 28 wherefore if they shall say unto you
[33:12] behold he is in the
[33:15] desert so that could be Tucson
[33:19] or Judea or the
[33:23] Sahara but I want you to notice that
[33:25] Jesus is giving a warning about his
[33:29] coming and that there would be
[33:32] people that would try to point you to
[33:36] one
[33:36] location on the earth to where you have
[33:40] to be to be a part of his
[33:43] coming wherefor they shall say unto you
[33:47] behold he is in the
[33:50] desert go not forth
[33:54] behold he is in the secret Chambers
[33:59] believe it
[34:00] not now the Lord Jesus was not mincing
[34:03] words
[34:04] friends and he believes his words had
[34:07] value amen so he's warning of us of a
[34:11] time before his coming that people would
[34:15] go pointing to a particular spot or a
[34:19] particular place and say now if you want
[34:21] to see the coming of the Lord you've got
[34:24] to be at Word of Life Church or you've
[34:26] got to be over here you've got to be
[34:28] over
[34:29] there notice this is the Lord
[34:33] himself for as a lightning cometh out of
[34:38] the East and shineth even
[34:42] unto the
[34:45] West so shall also the coming of the son
[34:50] of man
[34:53] be for
[34:55] wheresoever the carcass is
[34:58] there will the
[35:00] Eagles be gathered together notice Jesus
[35:04] didn't say
[35:08] chickens or
[35:10] vultures but
[35:12] Eagles aren't you glad you're part of an
[35:15] eagle
[35:16] message for wheresoever the carcass is
[35:19] there will the Eagles be gathered
[35:22] together now as it would be um Whenever
[35:26] two people would hear he the same
[35:30] sermon and one would leave the service
[35:33] and say well I heard this and this and
[35:36] this and another one say I didn't hear
[35:38] that I heard this and this and this and
[35:42] then another one would say that wasn't
[35:44] what I heard I heard this and this and
[35:47] this well now this is what Matthew wrote
[35:51] about this scenario Luke
[35:54] 17:34 listen the way that Luke wrote it
[35:59] I tell you in that
[36:04] night there shall be two
[36:07] men in one
[36:10] bed but now when you read the original
[36:14] the word men is not actually in the
[36:17] original text but it actually says there
[36:21] shall be two in one bed now you may
[36:24] wonder why would I say that well oh
[36:28] because homosexual Christians what a
[36:32] disgrace to even say such things like to
[36:35] take this scripture and prove that two
[36:38] men can be in the bed together but if
[36:41] you go to your original text you'll find
[36:44] out it does not say men at all I tell
[36:48] you in that night there shall be two men
[36:50] in one bed the one shall be taken and
[36:53] the other left if there's two men
[36:55] sleeping together they won't neither one
[36:57] of them be
[37:03] took the pastor's back
[37:08] home oh
[37:12] my one shall be taken and the other left
[37:16] two women shall be grinding together the
[37:21] one shall be
[37:23] taken and the other left now listen how
[37:27] the Rapture is going to be so people
[37:30] would just be going about their daily
[37:33] activities so two at the grocery store
[37:36] to at Walmart to at Lowe's to at Home
[37:38] Depot whatever to in a family maybe
[37:41] sitting on the couch you know going to
[37:44] church together whatever they're doing
[37:46] one will be taken and the other one will
[37:49] be left now no doubt these are
[37:53] Associates or friends or family members
[37:57] or they might even go to the same
[38:00] church two men shall be in the field the
[38:03] one shall be taken and the other left
[38:07] now what I love about this is that Jesus
[38:10] does not make the
[38:13] elect to where that they're not
[38:16] working and they're not grinding and
[38:19] they're not fixing breakfast and they're
[38:21] not just going about their job you see
[38:24] what I'm saying they they didn't feel
[38:26] like that they they they couldn't be
[38:29] spiritual if they had a job you're not
[38:32] very spiritual if you don't if you don't
[38:34] work you don't
[38:37] eat I love the way that he sets this
[38:40] because he shows us that people would be
[38:42] going about their daytoday
[38:45] activities two men shall be in the field
[38:48] the one shall be taken and the other
[38:51] left and they answered and said unto
[38:55] him where Lord
[38:58] and amazing how different he wrote it
[39:00] than what Matthew wrote it where
[39:05] Lord and he said unto them
[39:10] wheresoever the body is Matthew said
[39:14] carcass Luke said body
[39:17] wheresoever the body is fither will the
[39:22] Eagles be
[39:24] gathered together
[39:27] praise the
[39:29] Lord Brother Donnie how can I make sure
[39:32] that I'm going to be there well one
[39:34] thing of course you have to be in Christ
[39:37] Jesus another thing is you gather with
[39:41] eagles now so you can gather with them
[39:44] after a
[39:45] while you see you can't go to church
[39:47] with buzzards and chickens and expect to
[39:51] be gathered with Eagles at that day you
[39:54] can't belong to a denominational
[39:56] prostitute and be identified as a wise
[39:59] virgin it's totally impossible to be a
[40:01] wise virgin and a foolish virgin at the
[40:03] same time how many wants to be a part of
[40:06] that more than anything else in your
[40:08] life me too let's pray
[40:13] together Lord Jesus
[40:16] these great words that were
[40:19] spoken over 2,000 years
[40:23] ago for
[40:25] Millennia men have read these these
[40:28] scriptures taken text and given
[40:31] different titles to
[40:34] it some of
[40:36] sincerity some not some genuine God call
[40:42] men some not so
[40:45] much but father we have come here
[40:49] tonight that
[40:50] we could be prepared for this
[40:55] hour I don't think any anyone here in
[40:58] the right
[40:59] mind would want to
[41:02] fulfill that part of the verse of
[41:06] scripture about the one that was
[41:10] LIF oh
[41:13] Jesus I pray that our hearts our ears
[41:17] our
[41:18] minds would be open to the spirit of
[41:22] God that we would be able to be prepared
[41:26] for this hour that lays before us help
[41:29] us to see and believe that only a people
[41:34] with a perfect heart will ever leave
[41:39] this
[41:41] world people with perfect Hearts they
[41:46] hold no
[41:47] grudges they
[41:49] forgive they are
[41:51] peacemakers they love your word they
[41:55] love you oh God God I
[41:59] pray if there's one here tonight without
[42:02] a perfect heart may they realize the
[42:05] value of it
[42:07] father may it be their goal their desire
[42:11] Above All
[42:13] Things help us tonight father we ask in
[42:17] the name of
[42:19] Jesus and the Saints
[42:22] said God bless you you may be seated
[42:32] I realized to preach the coming of the
[42:37] Lord in the
[42:40] traditional Church
[42:43] way is what people expect when they hear
[42:48] these
[42:49] scriptures I know that it makes us quite
[42:54] unusual that we believe the coming of
[42:57] the Lord has so many
[43:01] aspects I'm not sure if you've ever
[43:04] looked at this before but in Matthew
[43:07] there
[43:08] 2427 Jesus said so shall it be at the
[43:13] coming of the son of
[43:16] man that Greek word there coming is
[43:21] parosa now it's sad that that word was
[43:25] used among a rank an element around our
[43:29] message that made basically a
[43:32] denomination out of it but yet it is a
[43:35] word that Jesus
[43:37] spoke and it can mean his Vis his
[43:42] Invisible Presence or it can also mean a
[43:47] Corporal
[43:49] return and the Lord Jesus we
[43:53] know spoke of a invisible coming as well
[43:59] as a visible one an invisible one would
[44:03] be for a a certain category of people
[44:08] those
[44:10] who are quickened by the spirit of
[44:15] God they are by God's presence known to
[44:21] be a mystical
[44:25] people they are mythical but they are
[44:29] also mystical now I know that word can
[44:33] be frightening because the devil uses it
[44:37] but a scarecrow shouldn't scare Eagles
[44:39] it should only scare
[44:42] crows now whenever we look at the coming
[44:45] of the Lord and the Rapture and the
[44:48] consummation of all the ages and the way
[44:51] that it's going to wind up with this
[44:53] great wonderful thing that we're
[44:55] anticipating every day of of our life we
[44:58] believe that it certainly will take more
[45:02] faith than has ever been in any other
[45:06] age and that faith that was once
[45:09] delivered to the Saints has been
[45:12] prophesy of course to be restored again
[45:16] in the last day with that would be a
[45:19] building and I know sometimes we may
[45:22] look at it and think what difference
[45:23] does it make if we go to church if we
[45:25] don't go to church what difference it
[45:27] make if we hear the word we believe the
[45:29] word why do your preachers keep saying
[45:31] listen to the tapes feed on the word
[45:33] what what what does that do well it's
[45:36] quite simple actually as you feed upon
[45:40] the word you actually become it which is
[45:45] the very reason Satan wants you so busy
[45:49] that you don't have time to read your
[45:51] Bible you don't have time to pray you
[45:54] don't have time to listen to tapes no
[45:56] more and I wonder if the things that are
[45:59] taking so much of our time are they
[46:03] actually worth it are they giving back
[46:06] to us things of Eternal value or are
[46:12] they things that just Rob us and make us
[46:16] more carnal more Earthly
[46:20] minded but it will truly be a special
[46:25] very unique people that will leave this
[46:28] world in a body change they are going to
[46:32] be a mystical people now watch's this in
[46:37] the message entitled perfect faith
[46:40] brother random says Jesus lived in a
[46:44] world that no one knowed about he was an
[46:49] odd person he lived in a world of
[46:53] perfect faith in the perfect
[46:57] God in which he
[47:01] was so he lived in a world of perfect
[47:05] faith in the perfect God in which he was
[47:12] but I remember he was still a
[47:16] mortal so it's like he was a mortal a
[47:19] human being get hungry get tired get
[47:23] weary have aches pains
[47:28] frustrations be troubled about issues in
[47:31] life feel the burdens of people all that
[47:34] sort of say and yet still live in a
[47:39] world of perfect Faith now watch he says
[47:44] if we lived in a perfect
[47:49] faith of a Christian to what we
[47:54] are we'd be a
[47:58] Mystic to the
[48:00] world a Mystic to the world the people
[48:05] wouldn't understand you you'd walk in
[48:09] the spirit what the spirit said you
[48:13] would do what it
[48:15] forbid you would not do then people then
[48:20] the people begin to say You' be a Mystic
[48:25] person to them that's the way it is to
[48:29] all
[48:30] believers they're a Mystic the people
[48:35] don't understand because they live in a
[48:39] world
[48:40] to
[48:43] themselves Now isn't that peculiar they
[48:46] live in a world to themselves yet
[48:49] they're human like other humans they get
[48:52] hungry they get tired they get weary
[48:55] they can get sick
[48:57] frustrations even doubts can come in
[49:00] their minds fears oh my all kinds of of
[49:04] things like that yet at the same time
[49:08] from their soul they can live in another
[49:11] world that is totally
[49:16] unseen now what's this that's the way it
[49:19] is to all believers they're a Mystic the
[49:21] people don't understand because they
[49:23] live in a world to themselves Jesus
[49:26] Jesus lived in that world that nobody
[49:29] else could touch the disciples couldn't
[49:35] understand him when he spoke to them
[49:38] they say about this he says and they
[49:41] said why you talk in
[49:43] riddles we don't understand this how can
[49:47] this be you see they wasn't in the world
[49:52] that he lived in know isn't that strange
[49:56] they they ate with him they slept with
[49:58] him as they sleep on the ground and they
[50:02] they was around him more than anybody
[50:04] else and they knew after a while his
[50:07] mannerisms his vocabulary certain ways
[50:11] he would say things and they could learn
[50:13] that of course by repetition and
[50:15] watching him but yet Jesus lived in a
[50:18] world that they did not understand so he
[50:22] would say certain things and they'd say
[50:24] what did you mean what what what are you
[50:27] talking about and he said well Lazarus
[50:31] is asleep and they said well if he's
[50:34] asleep he's he's doing good and he said
[50:37] Lazarus is dead amen now first he spoke
[50:42] from his
[50:43] world now they were part of his ministry
[50:47] but they were not in his world
[50:53] yet let me say it again they were part
[50:57] of his ministry they had received power
[51:02] to cast out Devils heal the sick do all
[51:05] sorts of wonderful things but their
[51:08] souls had not been
[51:10] transported into his world
[51:15] yet oh God help us
[51:19] Lord they wasn't in the
[51:22] world that he lived in see they couldn't
[51:27] understand him
[51:29] nobody could understand him now listen
[51:32] what Webster this is a combination of
[51:34] Webster and Miriam and a couple of
[51:37] different dictionaries that I got this
[51:39] word the meaning of the word Mystic from
[51:43] a Mystic is a person who seeks by
[51:49] contemplation and self
[51:52] surrender to obtain Unity with or
[52:01] absorption into
[52:05] deity
[52:07] or the
[52:12] absolute so a Mystic then is one who
[52:15] seeks by contemplation they they think
[52:18] it's not just you know that it passes
[52:21] through their mind every fourth day or
[52:23] every sixth Sunday or you know whatever
[52:25] but by
[52:27] contemplation it's their heart it's it's
[52:30] where they live so they seek by
[52:33] contemplation and they know that just
[52:36] can't think their way through it but
[52:38] also selfs surrender to obtain Unity
[52:44] with or
[52:46] absorption into deity or the
[52:51] absolute or who believes in the
[52:55] spiritual
[52:57] apprehension of
[52:59] truths that are
[53:02] beyond the
[53:05] intellect and the church
[53:11] said now believe it or not I just
[53:15] defined every
[53:17] member that will go in the
[53:22] Rapture now this is not something that
[53:25] you try to make yourself odd and make
[53:30] yourself different it's not that at all
[53:34] a lot of us have already got that
[53:36] anyhow so we don't need more of that
[53:38] actually we need to get away from some
[53:39] of that nonsense someone who attempts
[53:45] listen to this last part someone who
[53:49] attempts to be
[53:52] United with God
[53:56] so how many wants to be a Mystic if you
[53:58] never did
[54:01] before a Mystic listen to this in
[54:04] Matthew
[54:06] 13:10 and the disciples came and said
[54:10] unto him why speakest thou unto them in
[54:15] Parables he answered and said unto them
[54:19] because it is given unto you to know the
[54:25] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but
[54:29] to
[54:31] them it is not
[54:33] given now you see this is one thing that
[54:36] makes us so different of our
[54:39] comprehension and our belief about God
[54:42] even with the majority of the churches
[54:44] that would be in the tric Ci's area
[54:46] because we believe this is the way God's
[54:50] nature
[54:51] is that he will reveal himself to whom
[54:56] he chooses to and he will say things in
[55:00] such a way that some will not get it
[55:05] that's right and others will now if you
[55:08] don't believe that you don't believe
[55:09] what I just read from your very
[55:12] Bible so this puzzled the disciples why
[55:16] would it puzzle them they were not yet
[55:22] Mystics now listen to me carefully there
[55:25] is a vast difference between a Christian
[55:30] believer and a true
[55:37] disciple search the New Testament and
[55:39] see when you go to looking at those that
[55:42] were
[55:44] identified as
[55:47] disciples even some of the
[55:50] Pharisees
[55:51] believed but it did not call them
[55:55] disciples
[55:56] now our word disciple comes from the
[55:59] same root word that we get the word
[56:03] discipline
[56:05] from so a Believer can believe in the
[56:08] cross Believe In The Blood II even
[56:11] believe in the Holy Ghost believe in
[56:14] heaven Believe In Hell believe in all
[56:18] kinds of things and therefore that would
[56:20] make them in one sense a Believer
[56:24] because the word pistol which is where
[56:26] we get the word believe and Faith from
[56:29] actually means one of the meanings of
[56:31] that word is an intellectual face so
[56:36] from your mind somebody explains it to
[56:39] you and it makes perfect sense to you so
[56:43] a person that would believe they said oh
[56:46] yes I believe I I do I do I'm not saying
[56:49] that they don't but it does not mean
[56:52] that that person is a disciple because
[56:56] when they hear disciplinary word
[56:59] preached they will say nobody's going to
[57:02] tell me how to live nobody's going to
[57:06] tell me what to do nobody's going to
[57:09] tell me I can't cut my hair nobody's
[57:12] going to tell me that I can't wear
[57:14] makeup and I can't do this well you see
[57:16] that's what separates them from being a
[57:19] believer that believes in the cross to a
[57:22] daughter of God who wants to be
[57:25] disciplined by the word you see what I'm
[57:28] saying because they love the Lord Jesus
[57:31] and they want to be not only a believer
[57:34] in heaven and hell they want to be a
[57:39] disciple so they want their lives to be
[57:42] disciplined I hope that's what we've got
[57:44] here tonight that we want our lives to
[57:48] be disciplined by the word you follow me
[57:51] so far so whenever we hear the word
[57:54] preached and we see in our lives we're
[57:57] not quite matching up to that and just
[58:00] because we hear it say on Wednesday
[58:02] night doesn't mean that automatically it
[58:05] kicks in gear and starting right at the
[58:07] end of the service you automatically
[58:10] have it it may take you some time to be
[58:12] able to move up to that spot but by the
[58:15] grace of God you're going to do it
[58:18] because you are a disciple and when you
[58:22] hear the words you don't think that
[58:25] you're just sitting there listening to
[58:26] your pastor or brother Daryl or some
[58:28] other minister but you believe that God
[58:31] took that man's mouth and spoke through
[58:34] him to you and you took that personally
[58:39] as if it was the Lord Jesus
[58:42] himself now come on church now you know
[58:45] the prophet told us that that your
[58:48] pastor was God's angel that was sent to
[58:53] you y'all believe that so I wonder if we
[58:57] made an announcement now that come
[59:00] Sunday morning an angel of God will be
[59:05] speaking here behind the
[59:09] pulpit I wonder how many people if I
[59:12] didn't make it too clear now who that
[59:14] angel was they say Lord have mercy I
[59:17] wouldn't want to miss church if an
[59:18] angel's
[59:22] coming when your pastor is speaking to
[59:25] you that is an angel of
[59:28] God but
[59:30] yet people don't care to miss a little
[59:33] headache a little backache whatever why
[59:36] they simply don't believe what's been
[59:39] taught well come on now now what's the
[59:43] Lord Jesus as he speaks this to the
[59:45] disciples now remember they're not in
[59:48] this world yet but he's going to give
[59:51] them a little insight and they will
[59:54] recall it of course thank God Matthew
[59:56] wrote this down because he's the only
[59:58] one actually in the four gospels are
[59:59] quite rooted this way and he answered
[1:00:01] and said unto them because it is given
[1:00:04] unto you to know the Mysteries notice
[1:00:08] this word again that Jesus used it is
[1:00:12] muston Mysterion it is a hidden thing or
[1:00:17] a secret or a mystery or a religious
[1:00:22] secret confided only to to the
[1:00:28] initiated and not to ordinary
[1:00:33] Mortals now remember this is the founder
[1:00:37] of the church himself really we have no
[1:00:41] right to tell him how he ought to make
[1:00:44] his church he is the designer of his
[1:00:47] church and it is him that is telling us
[1:00:51] in the future ages how the church will
[1:00:55] be so then there will be a group that
[1:00:58] will be
[1:01:00] initiated to them will be given the
[1:01:03] mystery on there will be another group
[1:01:07] that will only come to hang around the
[1:01:10] initiated they will not be a partaker of
[1:01:14] mystery on they will come to church they
[1:01:18] might get saved they might partak in
[1:01:20] communion you have a fellowship dinner
[1:01:22] after church they'll be there you know
[1:01:25] you have a youth service Serv whatever
[1:01:27] they will come but the Lord Jesus is the
[1:01:30] only one that can actually initiate us
[1:01:34] into the mysteries of God oh I'm so glad
[1:01:38] I'm in ain't you now watch this is
[1:01:42] something then confided only to the
[1:01:45] initiated and not to ordinary
[1:01:50] Mortals oh my goodness you mean some of
[1:01:53] you all believe tonight sitting here
[1:01:57] that there are beings in this church
[1:02:00] that are more than ordinary morals
[1:02:07] am I'm one of
[1:02:11] them how many is one of
[1:02:15] them now listen as we go on the meaning
[1:02:17] of this word a hidden or secret thing
[1:02:21] not
[1:02:22] obvious to the understanding
[1:02:26] so now the other part of that meaning
[1:02:30] actually separated categories of people
[1:02:34] the initiated and the
[1:02:36] non-initiated then the latter half of
[1:02:39] this meaning actually separates the part
[1:02:42] of you that has been initiated and the
[1:02:45] part of you that hasn't because there's
[1:02:49] an element of our human understanding
[1:02:52] that never has understood God and never
[1:02:55] ever will come on let's just say that
[1:02:58] that's exactly the truth there's things
[1:03:00] God says and things that God does I
[1:03:03] don't understand it you don't understand
[1:03:05] it and we probably never will as a
[1:03:08] mortal but we still believe him with all
[1:03:10] of our hearts and we trust him is that
[1:03:13] right I trust him this has been the
[1:03:16] secret of my life for many many decades
[1:03:21] that I trust him even when I don't
[1:03:25] understand what he is doing when he
[1:03:27] moves in a certain way and it seems to
[1:03:30] me that it's backwards that it does not
[1:03:33] make any sense I trust him even when I
[1:03:37] don't understand a hidden or secret
[1:03:41] thing not obvious to the understanding a
[1:03:44] hidden purpose or counsel secret will
[1:03:50] the secret councils which govern God in
[1:03:55] dealing with the righteous which are
[1:03:59] hidden from ungodly and wicked men but
[1:04:03] plain to The
[1:04:06] Godly listen to this I thought this was
[1:04:09] awesome in the rinic writings which is
[1:04:12] the rabbis it denotes the Mystic uh oh
[1:04:17] here we go the Mystic or hidden
[1:04:21] sense now I know you may think brother
[1:04:24] Donnie this is far out out it really is
[1:04:28] way
[1:04:29] out but I I don't know if you know it
[1:04:32] yet but I hope the time I get done
[1:04:34] tonight it will help you to see that you
[1:04:38] already have a connection with the
[1:04:42] mystical of God you already have it you
[1:04:47] already have it you are
[1:04:49] identified with that Supernatural
[1:04:53] element many things of this last day
[1:04:57] message has already identified it
[1:05:00] watch's this and who is god let's just
[1:05:02] picture now as a little drama so you can
[1:05:05] get it let's see coming out of space
[1:05:07] where there's nothing let's make it like
[1:05:10] a little white
[1:05:13] light
[1:05:15] huh little white
[1:05:17] light like a
[1:05:21] Mystic
[1:05:22] light like a Halo
[1:05:26] so there's no humans there's no Earth
[1:05:29] there's no universe but here is the
[1:05:32] mystical part of God what is it God
[1:05:36] giving
[1:05:38] birth to a
[1:05:39] son like a Mystic light like a Halo and
[1:05:44] that was the logos that went out of God
[1:05:47] in the beginning that was the son of God
[1:05:51] that came out of the bosom of the father
[1:05:54] what is it it's going to be the first
[1:05:56] visible
[1:05:58] manifestation of the invisible God and
[1:06:01] you don't remember it but actually you
[1:06:04] were there when he came
[1:06:06] out because in the beginning was the
[1:06:09] word that's what we just saw right there
[1:06:12] that was the beginning in the beginning
[1:06:15] was the word so what what is was it
[1:06:18] before the beginning it was the Eternal
[1:06:22] but the Eternal wanted to manifest
[1:06:25] himself
[1:06:26] so when every attribute every name that
[1:06:29] would ever be on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:06:32] went out of God in the form of the son
[1:06:36] of
[1:06:37] himself notice that was the logos that
[1:06:40] went out of God in the beginning that
[1:06:41] was the son of God that came out of the
[1:06:43] bosom of the father that was what was in
[1:06:45] the beginning was the word so God can
[1:06:49] never add
[1:06:50] anymore that was a complete volume of
[1:06:54] every word God would ever say and it
[1:06:57] went out of him in the form of logos so
[1:07:01] if you ever have eternal life you was in
[1:07:04] that logos when it went out of
[1:07:06] God that's why there ain't no Devils
[1:07:08] there ain't no sickness there ain't no
[1:07:10] besetting sin there ain't nothing
[1:07:12] that'll ever keep you away from that
[1:07:15] father God who loved you because you
[1:07:18] were there before you ever sinned you
[1:07:21] were there before you ever was born a
[1:07:24] mortal and started drinking and cussing
[1:07:27] and lying and running around remember
[1:07:29] all that sin that was not you in the
[1:07:32] first place that was not who you was you
[1:07:35] was identified there before you ever
[1:07:38] come to this Earth as a
[1:07:43] baby oh thank you Lord
[1:07:46] Jesus thank you Lord Jesus and the Word
[1:07:51] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the
[1:07:54] beginning was God that out of God came
[1:07:56] the logos a part of God that went out of
[1:07:59] god notice again in my commission he
[1:08:01] says I was baptizing in the Ohio river
[1:08:04] at the foot of Spring Street and I heard
[1:08:07] something speak and I felt something
[1:08:09] take a hold of me and I looked up and
[1:08:13] when I did coming down from Glory came
[1:08:16] this worldl coming down where I was at
[1:08:20] Courier Journal
[1:08:23] newspaper pack article of it and said a
[1:08:30] Mystic
[1:08:31] star appears over a local Baptist while
[1:08:37] baptizing in the river so here was the
[1:08:42] mystical part of God which was in him
[1:08:45] way back in the beginning now we see
[1:08:48] that mystical part showing up again when
[1:08:52] whenever our Prophet is baptizing the
[1:08:55] 17th person at the Ohio River what did
[1:08:59] the voice say as John the Baptist was
[1:09:02] sent to forerun the first coming of
[1:09:05] Christ your message will forerun the
[1:09:08] second coming so don't you think it
[1:09:11] would be very fitting that the mystical
[1:09:14] would show
[1:09:16] up praise be to God I'd like to debate
[1:09:20] that brother Donnie I'd like to I ain't
[1:09:22] got no time for a bunch of these
[1:09:24] unbelievers
[1:09:26] well come on somebody oh my let them
[1:09:29] argue and fuss and debate and go on do
[1:09:31] whatever they want to do let us just
[1:09:33] move on closer to God and closer to God
[1:09:37] oh you know it's like the little old
[1:09:39] little old old squirrel that was out
[1:09:41] when brother Brandon was there shouting
[1:09:42] and worshiping God and he said it
[1:09:45] chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter
[1:09:46] chatter days of Miracles has passed God
[1:09:48] don't do this no more that's all it is
[1:09:50] this is Chatter chatter chatter if they
[1:09:53] don't fear it why do they to spend so
[1:09:56] much of their time trying to defeat it
[1:09:58] but let me tell them no matter how much
[1:10:01] time what a waste of time it is to be
[1:10:04] able to try to disprove it and one day
[1:10:07] they're going to stand before God and
[1:10:09] God himself is going to let that Prophet
[1:10:12] step right out there and judge them come
[1:10:15] on
[1:10:17] Saints oh my so here comes a Mystic star
[1:10:23] so he said they couldn't make it out oh
[1:10:26] up to probably 10,000
[1:10:30] people so I guess all 10,000 were
[1:10:34] deceived so all 10,000 people that was
[1:10:37] there actually didn't didn't see that it
[1:10:39] was just a figment of their
[1:10:42] imagination well praise the Lord you see
[1:10:46] why people that even set in message
[1:10:48] churches never connect with this
[1:10:52] message you've got to be born in the
[1:10:56] same world that the author who wrote
[1:11:00] it oh my oh probably 10,000 people saw
[1:11:04] it as it moved down where I was at and
[1:11:07] it went back up in the skies now watch
[1:11:09] this again in marriage and divorce now
[1:11:11] you remember the voice said go to Tucson
[1:11:15] remember the Mystic light in the sky the
[1:11:21] seventh Angels standing there come back
[1:11:24] and they opening of the Seven Seals
[1:11:27] watch what's taking place that is true
[1:11:31] rising of the sun and it went into the
[1:11:34] air and Life
[1:11:36] Magazine packed the picture Mystic
[1:11:40] something way in the
[1:11:42] Spheres where there could be no moisture
[1:11:47] where there could be no evaporation of
[1:11:49] anything 30 Mi High 27 Mi across coming
[1:11:53] right up from where those Ang Angels
[1:11:56] were oh but I would like to be there and
[1:11:59] I'd have to take my Polaroid and I'd
[1:12:01] have to have my iPhone I'd have to have
[1:12:04] this so are you going to do the same
[1:12:07] thing to make sure that Moses didn't
[1:12:10] write those Ten
[1:12:11] Commandments has anybody got a personal
[1:12:14] iPhone that you have a personal uh
[1:12:16] picture of God riding the 10
[1:12:20] commandments what does anyone have a
[1:12:24] picture of Josh UA holding up his hand
[1:12:27] and stopping this movement which had
[1:12:30] been for maybe hundreds of thousands of
[1:12:33] years and the Bible says it was never
[1:12:36] such a day like it or since that God
[1:12:40] hearkened to the voice of a
[1:12:43] man that God called it he said Son stand
[1:12:47] still and moon hang now over the valley
[1:12:49] of aelon as we was there five or six
[1:12:52] years ago whenever our last trip was
[1:12:54] there and driving down the bus down
[1:12:56] through there and the guy gets on the
[1:12:58] microphone in the bus and said now right
[1:13:00] here is a very famous uh Bible stories I
[1:13:02] know you all believe the Bible and he
[1:13:04] said it was right in this General
[1:13:06] vicinity right here that Joshua had the
[1:13:08] Sun and the Moon to stand still well
[1:13:11] scientifically they said well that's
[1:13:13] totally impossible well it is for a
[1:13:15] scientific person but it's not for a
[1:13:19] Mystic it's not for a Mystic because we
[1:13:23] believe what we cannot
[1:13:26] understand we believe what we cannot
[1:13:29] even prove come on somebody what do you
[1:13:33] say we have church here tonight I cannot
[1:13:37] understand how God can call somebody
[1:13:40] whose body has went beyond acids and
[1:13:43] gases mind there's absolutely nothing
[1:13:46] left and yet he will speak and thousands
[1:13:49] times thousands will come forth in a
[1:13:52] moment in a twinkling of an eye and
[1:13:55] those of us that are alive our mortal
[1:13:58] bodies will be changed how is that
[1:14:01] possible that the spirit of God will
[1:14:03] move over me and my gray hair will go
[1:14:06] back to being Brown and my wrinkles will
[1:14:09] all vanish away Hallelujah and you will
[1:14:12] go back to being a young man or a young
[1:14:15] woman brother Donnie scientifically
[1:14:17] explaining I can't I can scripturally
[1:14:20] explain it I can messagely explain it
[1:14:23] but I'll never explain it to make an
[1:14:25] unbeliever believe it only the initiated
[1:14:29] can believe such a thing because I
[1:14:32] granted it seems to be an impossible
[1:14:35] event but our God Specializes in doing
[1:14:39] things that are totally
[1:14:43] impossible oh
[1:14:49] Hallelujah watch this Christ have been
[1:14:51] in his own
[1:14:53] word get used
[1:14:56] to the
[1:14:58] mystical you see these little
[1:15:01] pockets going through the air they call
[1:15:08] saucers so forth well we better leave
[1:15:11] that alone here all these people come up
[1:15:15] missing and you say they don't hear from
[1:15:18] them they're standing there
[1:15:21] and they're not there
[1:15:25] that's the
[1:15:27] way the
[1:15:29] Rapture is going to
[1:15:36] be now let me tell you what's ahead of
[1:15:39] you I have no idea what you're going to
[1:15:41] face tomorrow I have no idea what I will
[1:15:43] face tomorrow but there are some things
[1:15:46] that I can tell you about your future
[1:15:49] that are more certain than about
[1:15:51] anything else in this
[1:15:53] life by the word of
[1:15:55] God listen what's going to happen to you
[1:15:59] mystical
[1:16:01] people one of them will
[1:16:05] drop right
[1:16:07] down and this terrestrial body will take
[1:16:13] on a Celestial body there'll be hide a
[1:16:19] hair or bones Left
[1:16:22] Behind it'll be trans transformed in a
[1:16:26] moment of time dropping right out of
[1:16:32] space
[1:16:34] Glory dropping right out of
[1:16:39] space I've always been interested in
[1:16:42] space I used to watch the
[1:16:45] jeton whenever I was a kid some of y'all
[1:16:49] don't even know what that is do you some
[1:16:50] of you that laughed you watched it too
[1:16:52] ain't you uhhuh you give away your age
[1:16:55] yeah so there was something about him
[1:16:57] and that all get out there and fly
[1:16:59] around in space I've got a connection
[1:17:02] not with the Jetson but with
[1:17:06] space Oh Glory to God listen here what
[1:17:10] oh in a moment of time dropping out of
[1:17:13] space look at what it'll do taking home
[1:17:18] that we'll see all this going on now the
[1:17:22] Pentagon wondering
[1:17:25] about these lights and Mystic lights now
[1:17:29] you know in the last 10 to 15 years
[1:17:32] there was a law after the 60s and
[1:17:35] 70s but it's picked back up again Air
[1:17:40] Force pilots Delta Pilots different ones
[1:17:45] seeing it and they can't figure it out
[1:17:49] it can appear and disappear our
[1:17:53] f16s cannot keep up with them our f35s
[1:17:58] our F
[1:17:59] 22s cannot keep up with them so they
[1:18:03] follow them and
[1:18:05] they
[1:18:07] disappear what you reckon it is maybe
[1:18:10] trial runs on theophanies they call them
[1:18:12] UFOs I call them ifs identified flying
[1:18:22] theophanies now of course see this this

[1:21:26] didn't even know what he was doing
[1:21:29] Joseph was giving up a type and a shadow
[1:21:32] of a coming Lord Jesus years and years
[1:21:35] after Joseph lived on the earth he
[1:21:37] didn't even know what he was doing what
[1:21:39] about us as the people of God that have
[1:21:41] a Bible and we have a prophet's message
[1:21:44] to be able to give us an Insight oh
[1:21:47] thank God we need to have confidence in
[1:21:50] the promise of the word of God we will

[1:22:06] to work toward prophecy brother bisc did
[1:22:09] not know when he fell in the water that
[1:22:11] day that was a word from God and yet the
[1:22:14] prophet knew it but he just kept it
[1:22:16] inside of his heart and he said the only
[1:22:18] thing troubles about me is he said there
[1:22:20] ain't nobody with a green checken shirt
[1:22:22] and he looks right there and brother bis
[1:22:24] go stands with that green checken shirt

[1:22:58] whatever you want to call her if she was
[1:23:00] a woman God's Prophet saw in that Vision

[1:23:05] enough nothing to keep her out of there
[1:23:07] and she will walk right into it not even
[1:23:10] knowing about that prophecy but I'll
[1:23:13] tell you one thing as unbelievers they
[1:23:15] fulfill it what about us as Believers
[1:23:18] it's our heart it's our soul it's our
[1:23:22] desire to obey God and fulf his word is
[1:23:25] that not what you
[1:23:30] want it ain't no wonder Satan tries to
[1:23:33] assail us with so much trouble so much
[1:23:35] heartache so much difference in our life
[1:23:38] and so much difference in the church

[1:25:55] temperatures well the bride is the only
[1:25:58] type of
[1:25:59] material that is appropriate to make the
[1:26:03] groom a wife
[1:26:05] with now when you take foolish virgin
[1:26:08] material they can be worldly they can be
[1:26:11] rough on the edges they never let you
[1:26:13] straighten them out they never really
[1:26:15] come to a dedicated consecrated full
[1:26:18] complete surrender in the Lord so they
[1:26:20] got bumps and ins and outs and ups and
[1:26:23] downs and all this that and other and
[1:26:24] the Lord Jesus is wanting a mature bride
[1:26:28] who loves him more than anything else in
[1:26:30] this world she's in this world but she's
[1:26:33] not of it and she will use it yes she
[1:26:36] will use the world but she is constantly
[1:26:38] watching that she does not become marred
[1:26:41] by the world that she's using every day
[1:26:44] so he had to cut out to make this bride
[1:26:47] he had to have a specific type of
[1:26:51] material and it would be a Word Perfect
[1:26:54] material that would be a perfect
[1:26:56] reflection of the man she would marry so
[1:27:00] he did not take a big big old piece of
[1:27:03] rough Humane material and get that bride
[1:27:06] at it I'm talking about before you come
[1:27:07] to the Lord I'm talking about how he
[1:27:10] looks at you when you reach your
[1:27:12] completion now he looks at you by his
[1:27:15] own ability and he sees what you are in
[1:27:19] Christ Jesus which is not what you and I
[1:27:22] see at all we see old lump of clay an
[1:27:25] old pile of dust that we did so
[1:27:27] discouraged who you ever get discouraged
[1:27:29] with yourself and you think you ought to
[1:27:31] be farther along and y'all to be doing
[1:27:33] better and y'all to know this and y'all
[1:27:34] to know that oh my I tell you we can be
[1:27:37] pretty discouraging to ourselves can we
[1:27:39] not but he doesn't look at that what he
[1:27:42] looks at is the finished product of what
[1:27:45] the material will come into so he can
[1:27:49] take that material and cut it out oh
[1:27:52] he'll let it be chopped out by the
[1:27:55] prophets and then he'll send the
[1:27:57] finishing tools and the finishing tools
[1:28:00] will come in the form of pastors and
[1:28:03] teachers and evangelists and and
[1:28:05] missionaries and he'll start working on
[1:28:08] them and honing them down if you could
[1:28:10] have seen this Lumber that some of the
[1:28:12] brothers started here with it was just
[1:28:14] all rough Sawmill Lumber splinters all
[1:28:17] over it rough as it could be and yet to
[1:28:20] be able to see what it's been
[1:28:22] transformed into what if you can look by
[1:28:25] by the eyes side of face and realize
[1:28:28] that's what the Lord Jesus sees about
[1:28:31] our life now watch's this there now
[1:28:34] you're getting into bride material see
[1:28:37] see
[1:28:39] see you're getting into rapturing
[1:28:46] condition so he says the words rapturing
[1:28:49] strengths rapturing Faith rapturing
[1:28:52] power
[1:28:55] watch this one
[1:28:57] rapturing condition now that means
[1:29:01] listen to this each one of us not just
[1:29:04] the pastor deacons
[1:29:06] trustees that means for the
[1:29:09] Ley every individual walks in a world
[1:29:14] with God
[1:29:15] Alone you're baptized into this kingdom
[1:29:19] and there's nobody in there but you
[1:29:24] and
[1:29:25] God he gives the orders and you pack
[1:29:29] them out whatever he says there's not a
[1:29:31] shout of a doubt nowhere you walk right
[1:29:34] on now watch on down in that paragraph
[1:29:37] he says now you're coming into perfect
[1:29:42] face perfect
[1:29:45] Perfection that cannot fail that face
[1:29:50] never fails yes he wanted he was was a
[1:29:54] Mystic to them with his perfect Faith so
[1:29:58] is it now with those who have perfect
[1:30:03] face are a
[1:30:05] Mystic to
[1:30:08] others can't you see why there is an
[1:30:11] element of
[1:30:12] carnal Believers around this
[1:30:16] message for
[1:30:18] years they have looked for a
[1:30:22] supplement to the message
[1:30:25] that they felt like would bring them to
[1:30:28] a rapturing
[1:30:29] face that would bring them to a
[1:30:32] rapturing condition now remember it's
[1:30:35] all based upon supply and
[1:30:40] demand if there was no demand among the
[1:30:46] people for things that aren't always
[1:30:50] word
[1:30:51] based there would be no Supply that's
[1:30:55] and if there was a supply and there
[1:30:58] wasn't people that would follow it the
[1:31:01] supply line would automatically die of
[1:31:05] itself and it's amazing I mean a man can
[1:31:08] preach whatever and there will be
[1:31:11] somebody that'll believe him a man can
[1:31:14] go contrary to the scripture and
[1:31:16] contrary to the message of the hour and
[1:31:18] there will be an element I I Marvel at
[1:31:20] people I honestly do and the the things
[1:31:23] that preachers will stand and preach and
[1:31:26] people will leave churches you know oh
[1:31:28] my uh good word-based ministers it's
[1:31:31] been that way for years it happened in
[1:31:32] the days of Paul whenever Paul dealt
[1:31:34] with the Galatians and he said at one
[1:31:37] time you would have pulled out your eyes
[1:31:39] and given them to me and he said now
[1:31:41] have I become your enemy because I've
[1:31:43] told you the truth well why because the
[1:31:46] judaizers came from Jerusalem and they
[1:31:49] tried to convert the Galatians and they
[1:31:51] did some of them and they turned them a
[1:31:54] people who Paul led to the Lord Jesus
[1:31:57] and they with their cunning words of
[1:31:59] wisdom actually turned them people right
[1:32:02] against God's Prophet who come and
[1:32:05] brought the word to him in the first
[1:32:06] place don't you understand Satan has
[1:32:09] done the same thing on down through
[1:32:11] every Church age he's doing the same
[1:32:14] thing right now he will get people and
[1:32:17] many times are not even preachers
[1:32:19] they're businessmen or this and that and
[1:32:21] the other and they debate about this and
[1:32:24] all you can't prove that I couldn't find
[1:32:26] the article for this and that and the
[1:32:28] other well while you're spending your
[1:32:30] time looking for it we're enjoying the
[1:32:32] blessings of God over here now if you
[1:32:35] need an article go ahead and see if you
[1:32:37] can find it but while you're hunting for
[1:32:39] that I'm going to be hunting for more
[1:32:41] quotes that I can be able to preach
[1:32:43] people into a body change with I don't
[1:32:45] figure there's no newspaper article that
[1:32:48] I'm going to find that's going to
[1:32:50] enhance my face in God's promised word
[1:32:54] of this hour and the church
[1:32:57] said but you see for those who need that
[1:33:00] type of thing it's like they simply
[1:33:03] cannot trust they've got to be able to
[1:33:06] put their hands on they've got to be
[1:33:08] able to feel it oh I've got to have an
[1:33:09] eyewitness of was I've got to have an
[1:33:11] eyewitness now you're a lying hypocrite
[1:33:14] that's right I said you are a lying
[1:33:16] hypocrite because you're requiring
[1:33:18] something of this Prophet that you never
[1:33:21] required of naam that you never required
[1:33:24] of habac so you're going to wait till
[1:33:26] all of habac of's word come to pass
[1:33:29] before you believe he was a prophet
[1:33:30] because they all ain't come to pass yet
[1:33:33] there's prophecies that Isaiah made
[1:33:35] thousands of years ago that still have
[1:33:38] not come to pass so are we going to wait
[1:33:42] to see if they all come to pass before
[1:33:45] we believe he was a prophet you're
[1:33:47] backwards God lets prophecies come to
[1:33:50] pass in your day and that gives you
[1:33:53] Faith to believe and wait on the others
[1:33:56] that will come to pass maybe even after
[1:33:58] you've left the
[1:34:00] Earth well come on some of Isaiah's
[1:34:03] prophecies will not be fulfilled to the
[1:34:06] Millennium some of his prophecies and
[1:34:09] Isaiah 66 will not be fulfilled until
[1:34:13] the eth day Ezekiel
[1:34:15] 44-48 will not be fulfilled until the
[1:34:19] Millennium Temple is built in the
[1:34:21] Millennium now you going to wait till
[1:34:23] that's fulfilled before you see if
[1:34:25] Ezekiel was a prophet oh come on wake up
[1:34:29] but a real son or daughter of God they
[1:34:31] just have it they read the same books
[1:34:34] they listen to the same types it's
[1:34:35] evident people can set under the same
[1:34:38] Pastor go to the same church have the
[1:34:40] same Association and have the same
[1:34:42] fellowship and one it will be revealed
[1:34:45] to and the other one it will pass right
[1:34:48] over and they argue and they debate
[1:34:51] about it well Benny hen said this you
[1:34:54] know and Charles swend said that and so
[1:34:56] and so said this and so and so if you
[1:34:59] want to read Benny hen go right ahead
[1:35:02] maybe he's a hen for you
[1:35:04] hen but if you're an eagle I don't
[1:35:07] figure that Benny hen has got a whole
[1:35:10] lot to tell
[1:35:12] me Well Benny hen talked about William
[1:35:15] brandham so if you're going to listen to
[1:35:17] something Benny hen said go to what that
[1:35:19] hen said about an eagle but I got news
[1:35:22] for you there ain't no chicken going to
[1:35:25] be able to give me a diet where it's
[1:35:27] going to produce a Rapture in my soul I
[1:35:30] need to hear message Pastor I need to
[1:35:33] hear message evangelist I need to hear
[1:35:36] message teacher I need to hear the
[1:35:39] message prophet of God in order to build
[1:35:42] a faith in me to get me ready to meet my
[1:35:46] loved
[1:35:48] ones
[1:35:52] woo now
[1:35:54] now you're coming into
[1:35:58] perfect
[1:36:01] Faith
[1:36:02] perfect
[1:36:05] Perfection that faith never fails yes he
[1:36:09] was a Mystic to them with his perfect
[1:36:12] faith and so is it now with those who
[1:36:17] have whoa whoa whoa whoa
[1:36:20] whoa now this is 1963
[1:36:25] so brother Brandon was saying that there
[1:36:27] was some people on the Earth even
[1:36:30] then that already had perfect
[1:36:36] Faith come on
[1:36:39] Saints they have perfect faith when was
[1:36:42] this
[1:36:43] preached
[1:36:47] August the
[1:36:50] 25th 1963
[1:36:57] August the
[1:36:58] 25th
[1:37:00] 1963 so what about
[1:37:03] August of
[1:37:07] 2024 don't you see those
[1:37:10] elect were living right up as far as
[1:37:13] they could go now remember the rising of
[1:37:16] the sun hadn't been
[1:37:17] preaching Easter cell hadn't been
[1:37:19] preached yet Harvest Time hadn't been
[1:37:21] preached yet turn on the light hadn't
[1:37:22] been preached many sermons had not yet
[1:37:25] been preached by August the 25th 1963
[1:37:29] and yet there was an element of people
[1:37:30] there that had already attained to
[1:37:34] perfect Faith which is what mature
[1:37:39] Faith so you ask God for something
[1:37:42] sometimes sometimes God says
[1:37:44] yes sometimes God says
[1:37:47] no sometimes God says wait a
[1:37:51] while and you still believe it
[1:37:55] amen how many's had it happen to
[1:37:58] you you still trust him oh you might get
[1:38:01] disappointed now anybody ever get
[1:38:04] disappointed when God says no anybody
[1:38:06] ever get disappointed whenever God says
[1:38:08] wait I sure that's the human element of
[1:38:10] us but our disappointment does not
[1:38:13] override the spiritual mystical part in
[1:38:16] our soul what is that friended that's
[1:38:19] born by the Breath of God
[1:38:24] Wow Let's
[1:38:27] stand praise be to God
[1:38:33] Amen I want you to listen to how this
[1:38:35] leads up and jariah a secret believer
[1:38:39] notice this date
[1:38:40] 1955 my how great it is to know that the
[1:38:44] anointing of the holy spirit that will
[1:38:46] take the church and the
[1:38:48] Rapture
[1:38:50] someday is present
[1:38:56] already there in
[1:38:59] 1955 and the seals hadn't been
[1:39:03] opened so an anointing was already
[1:39:07] here watch this I love this part end
[1:39:10] time
[1:39:11] evangelism the end time
[1:39:15] message is to get the bride
[1:39:20] ready and prepared
[1:39:24] for the
[1:39:25] Rapture can't you see why Satan is going
[1:39:28] to do everything he can to pull you away
[1:39:31] from this
[1:39:34] message that's why all these scoffers in
[1:39:36] the last days had to raise to get you to
[1:39:40] question the
[1:39:42] validity of this
[1:39:45] message cuz if you listen to it with the
[1:39:47] question well I'm not sure and trusted
[1:39:49] I'm not sure and trusted I'm not sure
[1:39:51] and trusted I'm not sure and trusted
[1:39:53] that's what it's all
[1:39:55] for to get you to question the
[1:40:00] validity and the
[1:40:02] authenticity of this prophet and his
[1:40:05] message you see that's what Satan done
[1:40:08] in the book of numbers to the people of
[1:40:11] Israel amen you remember the story of
[1:40:13] course Joshua and Caleb go 10 other

[1:43:32] together if you
[1:43:34] would my my Lord
[1:43:39] Jesus Lord I pray tonight
[1:43:42] father help us if we have to go back and
[1:43:46] listen to it again or
[1:43:48] again God I pray you'd make it real to
[1:43:51] us
[1:43:53] father we're not trying to make
[1:43:54] ourselves unusual and peculiar and
[1:43:57] odd we will be odd enough when the new
[1:44:00] birth transforms
[1:44:02] us we will be a very unique and very
[1:44:06] strange
[1:44:09] people those of our families that aren't
[1:44:11] converted will not understand
[1:44:14] us I know Lord by some of my own family
[1:44:17] that think I'm too religious and I'm
[1:44:20] probably a religious crank and I'm a
[1:44:23] religious
[1:44:26] fanatic but I'd rather be a religious
[1:44:28] fanatic than a football or a baseball or
[1:44:31] a basketball or a denominational
[1:44:34] fanatic everybody's going to be addicted
[1:44:36] to something so I'm going to be addicted
[1:44:38] to
[1:44:40] Jesus help us
[1:44:42] Lord I don't want to try to make myself
[1:44:45] different and make myself
[1:44:47] odd Lord but I just believe that if we
[1:44:50] live with you in our hearts as the type
[1:44:52] of HST in the center of
[1:44:55] gravity everything we do we pray about
[1:44:58] we pray about where we live we pray
[1:45:01] about business ventures we pray about
[1:45:04] where we go to school we pray about
[1:45:07] friends that we
[1:45:09] have we pray about the company that we
[1:45:12] keep I'm convinced you would keep us
[1:45:15] from a lot of hurts and things in life
[1:45:18] if we would pray about them I'd rather
[1:45:20] have two or three good friends than 500
[1:45:23] 497 of them's going to break my heart
[1:45:27] lie on you or whatever you might have
[1:45:29] spared me of a lot of
[1:45:31] them I pray Lord that you would help
[1:45:34] us Lord
[1:45:36] Jesus May the
[1:45:39] elect of the Word of Life
[1:45:44] Church pull their
[1:45:46] eyes from
[1:45:48] mother father brother sister
[1:45:53] College High
[1:45:55] School
[1:45:57] careers or they'll do that on the side
[1:45:59] that's just side
[1:46:01] stuff but their main focus is Jesus
[1:46:07] Christ
[1:46:10] hallelujah it's not really strange that
[1:46:13] would be be odd and unusual to the world
[1:46:16] and odd and unusual to denominational
[1:46:19] people but what's really bizarre Lord
[1:46:23] yeah is whenever we're odd and unusual
[1:46:25] to folks who say they believe this
[1:46:29] message cuz we live and walk in a world
[1:46:32] that only the
[1:46:34] initiated
[1:46:37] understand Lord God as I sat Carol and I
[1:46:40] in a room the other day ministering
[1:46:45] to
[1:46:47] someone hundreds and hundreds of miles
[1:46:49] away from here sitting there just
[1:46:52] praying under my breast and waiting on
[1:46:56] you we sat there for a couple of
[1:46:59] hours just
[1:47:02] talking Carol was sitting there with me
[1:47:05] praying I'm
[1:47:07] sure and all of a sudden your presence
[1:47:11] hit
[1:47:13] me as I looked up it was like I could
[1:47:17] see it in the
[1:47:19] lights and I knew it was time
[1:47:24] so I Rose from my seat and went
[1:47:27] over prayed for the individual and your
[1:47:29] presence come
[1:47:32] down oh
[1:47:36] Jesus I know if we follow you we'll be
[1:47:39] laughed at ridicule made fun
[1:47:44] of Jesus I love you and I want to put
[1:47:46] you
[1:47:48] first help me
[1:47:51] father and how many young men young
[1:47:54] women maybe older ones as well you want
[1:47:58] to be what God has made you to be and
[1:48:01] remember keep in mind I'm not talking
[1:48:03] about you making yourself odd I'm just
[1:48:05] talking about you surrendering to the
[1:48:07] Lord
[1:48:08] Jesus and he uses you for whatever he's
[1:48:12] called you to do and remember he will
[1:48:14] never lead you contrary to his
[1:48:19] word he will never lead you contrary to
[1:48:22] do anything contrary to his scripture or
[1:48:26] what the teaching of his Prophet has
[1:48:28] told us and when you feel led to do
[1:48:32] something and either you find it
[1:48:34] yourself or it's sent to you by other
[1:48:37] people and they show you that what you
[1:48:39] feel led to do is contrary to scripture
[1:48:42] and the message of the hour leave that
[1:48:44] thing as fast as you
[1:48:47] can because you'll be given a period of
[1:48:50] Grace and if you override it you'll move
[1:48:53] out of the perfect will of God into the
[1:48:56] permissive will of God then you open
[1:48:57] yourself up to all kinds of
[1:49:02] demons oh Jesus Keep Me
[1:49:07] Lord Keep Me
[1:49:10] Jesus Keep Me true
[1:49:14] Lord help me

[1:49:28] handfuls oh God how many have we seen
[1:49:31] down through the
[1:49:32] years that felt like they had a gift of
[1:49:35] God and watch what it leads to the
[1:49:38] people that it leads astray and even
[1:49:41] people say they believe the message and
[1:49:44] speaking in tongues and prophesying and
[1:49:47] telling people to leave their wives or
[1:49:49] their husbands and go be married to
[1:49:51] somebody else in the the
[1:49:54] church and saying thus sayeth the

[1:52:43] sermon I stopped the tape and I I copied
[1:52:47] and paste it and sent it to Carol and
[1:52:49] told her to send it back to me so I
[1:52:51] could send it to Brother
[1:52:54] Steve sister tresa if you haven't read
[1:52:56] it brother Bram says it's something like
[1:53:00] this faith in your heart you believe
[1:53:02] God's word you're a Mystic and all that
[1:53:05] sort of
[1:53:06] thing the doctor could tell you you're
[1:53:10] going to die your respiration is gone
[1:53:14] your heart your blood pressure all that
[1:53:16] he mentioned several
[1:53:18] things and it'd say there's no hope for
[1:53:21] you
[1:53:23] you could life in that doctor's face
[1:53:27] face
[1:53:28] rather and he said you could be like
[1:53:31] Elijah as he was talking to them false
[1:53:34] prophets and so why don't you scream a
[1:53:37] little louder maybe he's gone on a
[1:53:39] hunting trip or a fishing trip you could
[1:53:43] life in the doctor's face because it has
[1:53:46] been revealed to
[1:53:48] you oh praise the Lord
[1:53:51] Jesus now friends if you're not there
[1:53:53] tonight don't be
[1:53:55] discouraged cuz we have a word from the
[1:53:58] Lord through this prophet and his
[1:54:00] message of the hour that there is a
[1:54:03] church in the making that is going to
[1:54:06] rise to this
[1:54:08] place Hallelujah just as the foolish
[1:54:11] virgin will rise to theirs as the
[1:54:14] Antichrist will rise to
[1:54:17] his you and I will rise to ours they're
[1:54:20] doing it without a surrendered will to
[1:54:23] God how much more can God do with us if
[1:54:28] we will surrender our all to him
[1:54:31] tonight they're doing it not even with
[1:54:34] the intention they don't even believe in
[1:54:36] God many of them they don't love him
[1:54:38] they're not doing it to fulfill his
[1:54:41] purpose God has put it in their hearts
[1:54:44] the Bible said to fulfill his will they
[1:54:47] don't even want to do it but he's put it
[1:54:51] inside their heart
[1:54:53] it's a power that overpowers them well
[1:54:57] if the spirit of Prophecy is that
[1:54:59] powerful to move on people that are
[1:55:02] agnostics and infidels and the spirit of
[1:55:06] Prophecy would drive them to obey God's
[1:55:08] word what about the spirit of love that
[1:55:11] moves upon bride material and that bride
[1:55:14] is crying day and light Lord Jesus I
[1:55:17] love you Lord I want to please you Lord
[1:55:19] forgive me Lord I I'm not where I want
[1:55:21] to be that's your petition that's your
[1:55:24] cry and you think you're not going to
[1:55:26] fulfill God's

[1:56:05] power of God we will see what seemed
[1:56:09] like
[1:56:11] impossible because we are believers in
[1:56:15] your promis word lord and there ain't
[1:56:18] enough devils in hell to stop us from
[1:56:21] fulfilling our prophecy maybe there's a
[1:56:24] daughter of God tonight that's got on a
[1:56:27] green chcken shirt maybe there's a mama
[1:56:30] here tonight that's been asking God for
[1:56:32] healing asking God for salvation for her
[1:56:35] son or her daughter but she's veiled
[1:56:38] tonight in a green checkered shirt of
[1:56:40] Prophecy she's arriving right this very
[1:56:43] night for God to fulfill that promised

[1:57:55] what are they thinking that they do not
[1:57:58] want to preach the message from their
[1:58:00] pulpits apparently they put more value
[1:58:03] on their own words than they do the
[1:58:05] value of God's Prophet but Lord Jesus as
[1:58:09] long as you give me strength and wisdom
[1:58:11] help me father to be able to preach the

[1:58:37] in the land lord and that is preaching
