[14:59] &gt;&gt; Anybody that's in a disagreement with
[15:01] that, we're going to let you leave right
[15:02] now. How many of you want to have a good
[15:05] time here today? How many of you want to
[15:07] worship and praise the Lord for what
[15:08] he's done for you? How many of you can
[15:10] say this? I wouldn't take nothing from a
[15:12] journey now. I wish I'd have started a
[15:15] long time ago. Don't you? Somebody say,
[15:18] "Praise the Lord." Give him one more
[15:20] good hand clap of praise. If you love
[15:22] him,
[15:24] well, it wouldn't take nothing for my
[15:26] journey now. I got to make it to heaven
[15:30] somehow. Though the devil tips me, tries
[15:33] to turn me around.
[15:36] He's offered everything that's got a
[15:39] name. All the wealth I want worldly
[15:42] baby. Good still. I wouldn't take
[15:44] nothing from my journey now.
[15:47] [Applause]
[15:48] I started out traveling for the Lord
[15:51] many years ago.
[15:54] I've had a lot of heartache, had a lot
[15:57] of grief and war.
[16:00] But when I would stumble, then I would
[16:03] all die.
[16:06] I'd say
[16:09] nothing for my journey now.
[16:12] I wouldn't take nothing for my journey
[16:15] now. I got to make it to heaven somehow.
[16:19] Oh, the devil just be tries to turn me
[16:22] around.
[16:24] He's offered everything that's God and
[16:27] ain't the wealth I want and worldly
[16:30] fame. If I could still, I wouldn't take
[16:32] nothing for my journey now.
[16:36] There's nothing in the world that could
[16:39] ever take the place of God's love.
[16:43] All the silver and gold can ever find my
[16:46] love.
[16:49] When my soul is healing, I begin to feel
[16:52] his power.
[16:55] I can say thank the Lord
[16:57] for my journey now.
[17:02] Take nothing
[17:05] to heaven somehow
[17:09] tries to turn me around.
[17:13] He's all
[17:15] got all the
[17:18] world
[17:20] still
[17:21] on my journey now.
[17:25] I wouldn't change nothing for my
[17:27] journey. Now I got to make it to heaven
[17:31] somehow. Though the devil tempts me,
[17:33] tries to turn me around.
[17:37] He's offered everything that's God and a
[17:41] wealth I want and worldly fame. If I
[17:44] could still, it would take nothing for
[17:46] my journey now.
[17:49] Now I started out traveling for the Lord
[17:52] many years ago.
[17:54] [Music]
[17:56] I've had a lot of heartache, had a lot
[17:58] of troubles and war,
[18:02] but when I would stumble, then I would
[18:04] humble down.
[18:08] &gt;&gt; I would say thank the Lord
[18:11] for my journey now.
[18:14] I wouldn't take nothing from my journey
[18:16] now. I got to make it to heaven somehow.
[18:21] Though the devil tips me, tries to turn
[18:23] me around.
[18:26] He's offered everything that's gone and
[18:29] name all the wealth I want and worldly
[18:32] fame. If I could still wouldn't take
[18:34] nothing for my journey now. One more
[18:37] time. No, I wouldn't take nothing for my
[18:40] journey now. I got to make it to heaven
[18:44] somehow. Though the devil tempts me,
[18:47] tries to turn me around.
[18:52] Everything has got a name. I will not
[18:56] world famous.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; If we could still wouldn't take nothing
[18:59] for my journey now.
[19:06] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. You can be
[19:08] seated this morning. And we may go just
[19:11] a little bit over in preliminaries this
[19:13] morning, but I think we'll be all right.
[19:15] We're fixing to hear from the Lord here
[19:17] just in a little bit. I believe God's
[19:19] going to give give us exactly what we
[19:21] have need of in this service today.
[19:23] Amen. I want to got a special real
[19:27] special song for you. Sister Burns and
[19:30] her daughter. Now, I don't know where

[19:37] way to the platform. Brother David is
[19:39] going to be singing. And the old
[19:40] people's going to sing for you this
[19:42] morning. So, we just have four songs. I
[19:46] believe we can manage that. You'll get
[19:47] brother Donnie on the platform in plenty
[19:49] of time. This is the best place you're
[19:51] going to be all day anyway. You might as
[19:53] well just settle that right now. This is
[19:55] the safest, best place you could be.
[19:58] Right here in the house of the Lord.

[20:01] praise this morning if you love him.
[20:06] A new singer. We're glad. We're glad of
[20:08] it, aren't we?
[20:10] &gt;&gt; Appreciate them. Give him a good hand
[20:11] this morning if you would.
[20:22] [Music]
[20:42] Well, blue skies and hillsides feel so
[20:45] far away. And I wrote in my notebook
[20:49] that I've seen better days than the ones
[20:52] as of late.
[20:56] I can't bear the weight.
[21:00] The rain won't stop pouring out my
[21:04] window pane. And I haven't left my
[21:06] bedroom in 76 days. I wish something
[21:11] would change
[21:14] cuz I'm losing
[21:16] faith.
[21:18] So I brought it up in a desperate
[21:22] prayer.
[21:24] Lord, why are you keeping me here? Then
[21:29] he said to me,
[21:33] child, I'm planting seeds
[21:37] cuz I'm a good God and I have a good
[21:41] plan. So trust that I'm holding a
[21:45] watering can. And someday you'll see
[21:52] that flowers
[21:54] grown
[21:56] in the valley.
[22:13] So whatever the reason, I'm barely
[22:16] getting by. I'll trust it's a season
[22:19] knowing that you're by my side every
[22:22] step of the way.
[22:27] And I'll be okay
[22:30] cuz I brought it up in a desperate
[22:35] prayer.
[22:37] Lord, why are you keeping me here? Then
[22:41] he said to me,
[22:45] "Child, I'm planting seeds
[22:49] cuz I'm a good God and I have a good
[22:53] plan. So trust that I'm holding a
[22:57] watering game. And someday you'll see
[23:03] that flowers
[23:06] grow
[23:07] in the valley
[23:10] [Music]
[23:24] when I'm on the mountain and looking
[23:27] down below. I'll see a valley of flowers
[23:32] that need a time to grow. And I'll thank
[23:35] you for the rain.
[23:38] The hurting days of pain.
[23:44] And I'll bring it up in a grateful
[23:48] prayer. Thank you, Jesus, for keeping me
[23:52] there. You know just what I need.
[23:59] And you've planted seeds
[24:03] cuz you're a good God with a real good
[24:06] plan. And you hold my world and a
[24:10] watering can so I can have peace.
[24:16] Cuz flowers
[24:18] grow
[24:20] in the valley.

[30:07] You are my everything
[30:10] and I will adore you.
[30:16] Holy, holy, holy
[30:20] is God Almighty
[30:24] who was and is and is to come.
[30:33] With all creation I sing praise to the
[30:38] King of Kings.
[30:41] You are my everything
[30:44] and I will adore you
[30:50] [Music]
[30:56] and I will adore you.
[31:02] You're worthy.
[31:04] [Music]
[31:14] [Applause]
[31:31] [Music]
[31:40] The timeless theme,
[31:43] [Music]
[31:45] earth and heaven will pass. pass away.
[31:51] It's not a dream.
[31:55] God will make all things new
[31:58] that day.
[32:01] Gone
[32:03] is the curse from which I stumbled
[32:09] and fell.
[32:12] Evil
[32:14] is banished
[32:17] to everlasting
[32:22] hell.
[32:26] No
[32:28] more night.
[32:32] No
[32:34] more pain.
[32:39] No more tears.
[32:42] Never crying
[32:45] again.
[32:48] And praise
[32:51] uses to
[32:54] the great
[32:56] I am.
[32:59] Oh, we will live
[33:02] in the light
[33:05] of the risen
[33:09] lamb.
[33:15] [Music]
[33:21] You see all around
[33:25] all the nations bow down
[33:29] to sing.
[33:32] The only sound
[33:35] is the praises to Christ
[33:39] our king.
[33:42] Slowly
[33:45] the names
[33:47] from the book
[33:50] are read.
[33:52] I know the king.
[33:56] So there's no need,
[33:59] no need to dread.
[34:04] Oh, no
[34:07] more night,
[34:11] no
[34:12] more pain.
[34:16] Oh, no
[34:18] more tears.
[34:22] Never crying
[34:24] again.
[34:28] and praise
[34:30] uses to
[34:34] the great
[34:36] I am.
[34:39] Oh, we will live
[34:42] in the light
[34:45] of the rich
[34:49] sun.
[34:52] You see over there,
[34:55] there's a body and it's prepared
[35:00] just for me
[35:02] where we will live
[35:05] with our Savior
[35:08] eternally.
[35:16] No
[35:19] more night.
[35:22] There'll be no
[35:25] no more pain.
[35:28] There'll be no
[35:30] more tears.
[35:33] Never crying
[35:36] again.
[35:39] and praise
[35:42] to
[35:44] the great
[35:47] I am.
[35:50] Oh, we will live.
[35:52] [Music]
[35:53] We're going to live.
[35:57] Oh, we will live
[36:00] in the light
[36:03] of the rich.
[36:06] Hey,
[36:09] risen life.
[36:12] [Music]
[36:19] [Applause]
[36:44] [Music]
[36:59] We had two that left us this week.
[37:02] Precious people. Brother Steve, Sister
[37:05] Patty.
[37:08] If somebody had walked up to them and
[37:09] said,
[37:11] "If you'll stay here, we're going to
[37:14] give you
[37:15] all the money you could ever spend.
[37:18] We're going to give you all the property
[37:19] that you could ever enjoy.
[37:22] They wouldn't trade that for what I
[37:25] believe they heard.
[37:27] Welcome home.
[37:29] That's our goal is to hear him say,
[37:33] "Welcome home." Is that your desire
[37:35] today? This song, hope we can sing it
[37:38] for you this this morning. Most of all,
[37:41] I want to look upon the master.
[37:57] [Music]
[38:03] Things of earth no longer matter
[38:07] on that morning
[38:12] when the skies are split.
[38:15] and saints are called away.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's right.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; Most of all,
[38:24] I want to be among that number,
[38:31] the bride of Christ
[38:33] set aart in wide.
[38:38] [Music]
[38:40] Most of all,
[38:42] I want to look upon the master
[38:50] and sing praises when at last
[38:55] small.
[38:59] I want to know I run the race.
[39:03] Hear Jesus say I'll help you. And most
[39:08] of all,
[39:10] I ought to hear you say, "Well done.
[39:19] [Music]
[39:32] Thank you, Lord.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; Now everything
[39:38] down here will dim and lose its value.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; We compare
[39:47] with all the glory
[39:50] we'll behold.
[39:54] But most of all,
[39:56] just to look upon my savior,
[40:03] it'll make you heaven.
[40:06] If there were no streets of closely the
[40:10] same with
[40:13] most of all
[40:15] I want to look upon the master
[40:22] and sing praises when at last the battle
[40:28] won.
[40:31] I want to know I've run the race.
[40:36] Hear Jesus say
[40:40] and most of all
[40:43] I want to hear
[40:46] well done.
[40:50] I want you to know I've run the race.
[40:55] Here Jesus say the faith.
[40:59] And most of all,
[41:02] I want to hear
[41:06] well done.
[41:08] [Music]
[41:18] [Applause]
[41:26] I don't hear that.
[41:29] My goodness.
[41:32] But if I do hear that, won't that be
[41:34] awesome
[41:36] &gt;&gt; to me? There's nothing greater
[41:39] that we could hear than for the King of
[41:43] Kings
[41:45] to look at us that day and say, "Well
[41:48] done."
[41:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; Then if you done all kinds of things,
[41:54] you know, if you just uh you were
[41:56] wealthiest person in the world, rich,
[41:58] famous, important,
[42:01] celebrity, and all that sort of thing.
[42:04] and to hear him say, "Depart from me. I
[42:07] never knew you." What good would all
[42:09] that do you in life?
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Then if you was religious and a
[42:13] churchgoer
[42:14] and you'd given up a lot of things for
[42:16] what you thought was Christianity and
[42:19] you still hear him say that. To me, that
[42:21] would be even worse.
[42:23] That makeeliever person is the one
[42:26] that's really the bad one.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; But we don't have to be that today.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; No. Aren't you glad you are a believer?
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; We welcome you today. We certainly
[42:40] appreciate the opportunity that we can
[42:41] be together again. And brother Louie has
[42:44] already expressed about brother Steve
[42:47] Newsome gone to his reward and sister
[42:49] Patty. And as I've said it before, we're
[42:52] getting more and more and more on the
[42:54] other side. I believe we're getting
[42:56] closer and closer with every one of
[42:58] them. Don't you?
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:00] Let's read about today and talk about
[43:04] what will help us to get there and when
[43:07] we stand before him that day that we
[43:10] won't have to be disappointed.
[43:13] Apparently, the prophet preached that
[43:15] sermon before they maybe before they
[43:17] started recording his sermons. I'm not
[43:19] sure exactly, but he referred back to it
[43:23] uh several different times through the
[43:24] years. And he said, "Many of you
[43:26] old-timers remember that I preached a
[43:28] sermon on disappointed people at the
[43:32] judgment." Then he goes to listing
[43:34] different people, the prostitute, the
[43:36] drunk, the liar, you know, lots of those
[43:39] people is that they won't be
[43:40] disappointed, but it's a person who
[43:42] feels like that they were right with God
[43:45] and that they were going to church and
[43:47] all that and they'll be the ones that'll
[43:49] be disappointed. I'm afraid that looking
[43:52] at some of these things that we've been
[43:54] looking at in the scripture, it's going
[43:56] to be some of the folks that's going to
[43:58] miss this mark right here that's going
[44:01] to be the most disappointed. There's
[44:03] going to be folks around this message
[44:05] that'll feel like because they play
[44:07] tapes or because they dress a certain
[44:09] way or do a certain thing that they're
[44:12] definitely going to be there. They're
[44:13] going to be bride. But you see, if we
[44:15] miss the requirement of the bridegroom
[44:18] himself, we won't be there.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Friends, we don't get a second chance.
[44:23] It's not like let us see a church age be
[44:25] played back over again. If you miss it,
[44:27] get a second try. This is your one try,
[44:30] your one chance. So, we want to make the
[44:33] best of it, don't we?
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; By the grace of God.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Second Peter chapter 1 verse two.
[44:40] And if you all be patient with me today,
[44:43] we might get done with patience.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; All right.
[44:48] Of
[44:48] &gt;&gt; course, then we're going to godliness.
[44:50] So, I'm not sure if you're any better
[44:51] off or not.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; I've been enjoying it.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Sort of.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Sort of.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; I've never heard so many comments about
[45:04] anything I've ever preached as patients.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; But it's been people praying that I'd
[45:08] hurry.
[45:11] and they're hoping and praying to God
[45:12] that I don't make a series out of this
[45:14] one word, I think.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; But if we need it, I say, Lord, grant it
[45:19] to us.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[45:23] through the knowledge of God and of
[45:25] Jesus our Lord, according as his divine
[45:28] power hath given unto us all things, I
[45:31] love that, that pertain unto life and
[45:35] godliness.
[45:38] Godliness, you know what it means? To be
[45:42] like God
[45:44] comes from the root Greek word theos
[45:49] which means God which is the same word
[45:52] we get our word theophony
[45:55] from theos to be like God
[46:00] through the knowledge of him that hath
[46:02] called us unto glory and virtue whereby
[46:04] are given unto us exceeding great and
[46:07] precious promises that by these you
[46:10] might be protected makers of the divine
[46:12] nature, having es escaped the corruption
[46:16] that is in the world through lust.
[46:19] And beside this, giving all diligence,
[46:22] add to your faith virtue, and to virtue
[46:26] knowledge, and to knowledge temperance,
[46:29] and to temperance patience, and to
[46:32] patience godliness,
[46:34] and to godliness
[46:37] brotherly kindness, and to brotherly
[46:39] kindness, charity. I may like to be
[46:43] remembered today as we pray. Amen. Me,
[46:45] too.
[46:48] Heavenly Father, we have been blessed
[46:50] just to be here already this morning,
[46:54] hearing these songs and sensing your
[46:57] presence here. And we believe that
[47:00] you're here to do some wonderful things
[47:02] for us today.
[47:05] Dear God, we've not come just as
[47:09] uh a lot of folks would come to church
[47:11] on Sunday morning to show off their
[47:13] clothes or meet with one another and
[47:16] talk about our business deals or this or
[47:19] that, but we've come to worship, to
[47:22] pray, to praise,
[47:24] oh God. We've come to see one another,
[47:26] sure, but we've come mainly to hear from
[47:30] you. I pray you'd help us today,
[47:34] Lord. One of these days, if we go by the
[47:37] way of the grave, each of us are going
[47:39] to face what our brother Steve Newsome
[47:42] faced and what our sister Patty faced.
[47:45] Dear God, we want to be ready. When they
[47:49] go there, I won't be able to go with
[47:52] them. They'll take no money. They'll
[47:56] take none of their clothes. They'll take
[47:58] none of their possessions.
[48:01] They'll only take with them their
[48:04] character.
[48:05] So, Father, then if that's all we're
[48:07] going to take when we face man's
[48:10] greatest fear, then we believe our
[48:14] character is the most important thing
[48:17] that we could be preparing for. So, help
[48:20] us today, Lord, as we look into your
[48:23] word. We commit the service, the
[48:25] speakers, the hearers to you. speak to
[48:28] us, Father, in the name of the Lord
[48:29] Jesus. And the saints said,
[48:32] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[48:36] Let me read to you again the meaning of
[48:38] the word patience. And who knows, it
[48:40] might be the last time for a while that
[48:41] I've read it to you. You just never know
[48:44] about the Lord what he's going to do.
[48:45] Though I may think I'm done with it, and
[48:47] he'll tell me to come back again the
[48:49] next time I'm going to preach and say,
[48:51] "Take a 27 months series on it." And
[48:53] I'll say, "All right, Lord. I'll do it
[48:55] if that's what you want me to do. cuz
[48:57] I've found out a long time ago that he
[49:00] knows more about church than I do.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; He knows more about me than what I do.
[49:05] And he knows more about you than what
[49:08] you do.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; Uh Peter in using this word. Now
[49:12] remember Peter started out as a man that
[49:14] was ignorant and unlearned. And every
[49:17] time I read his epistles, I marvel
[49:20] because it does not sound like a man
[49:22] that was ignorant or unlearned at all.
[49:26] It sounds like the man that you would
[49:28] think had a great education and not a
[49:30] lot of understanding and using Greek
[49:33] words that were so precise for the
[49:35] epistle that he was going to read. You
[49:37] would think this was a guy that knew all
[49:39] the pneumatics and all the dip thongs
[49:41] and all the things that's Greek language
[49:44] that he knew all of that so perfectly
[49:46] and that he studied him. You know what I
[49:48] see that it was the spirit of God taking
[49:51] that man and using him. But now remember
[49:54] he was not just writing words. That was
[49:56] not a reality. But Peter had experienced
[50:00] these things on his own. And the word
[50:03] patience is enduring patient
[50:06] continuence, patient waiting,
[50:08] steadfastness.
[50:10] In the New Testament, the characteristic
[50:12] of a man who is not swerved from his
[50:15] deliberate purpose and his loyalty to
[50:18] faith and piety by even the greatest
[50:22] trials and sufferings patiently and
[50:27] steadfastly. Now, we know that people
[50:30] can read the Bible and and we be honest
[50:32] today that there are people that are
[50:34] greater theologians than most of us will
[50:36] ne ever be, including me. Now, I've
[50:39] studied the Bible for a long time. Read
[50:42] the Bible. I do all kinds of studying,
[50:44] looking at all different sorts of
[50:46] dictionaries and this and that and the
[50:47] other. But there are theologians that
[50:50] would just make me feel like I was
[50:52] probably a kindergarten student and they
[50:56] would be able to say great big old long
[50:58] words and I wouldn't even know what they
[51:00] was talking about. I've got a few
[51:01] message brothers that do that. And
[51:03] whenever they'll send me a text every
[51:05] now and then, I'll have to get my phone
[51:07] out and type in on the dictionary what
[51:09] they're even saying. I'm not sure why
[51:11] they're saying that cuz they know know
[51:12] I'm dumber than a coal bucket anyway.
[51:15] But I guess they just want to impress me
[51:16] somehow. But you know, there's people
[51:19] that would outdo us as far as wit and
[51:22] would outdo us maybe as far as
[51:24] understanding great big words. But when
[51:27] I read this, this is what I like to keep
[51:30] in mind. This is the very man who wrote
[51:33] this by the spirit of God. And he wrote
[51:36] this scripture. But he not only wrote it
[51:39] as a man of understanding, but he wrote
[51:42] it as a man of experience. Now, we all
[51:45] know that understanding is a great thing
[51:48] and we have to have it. But there's
[51:50] something about experience that is such
[51:55] a teacher. Many of you have went through
[51:57] tremendous times in your life and trials
[52:00] and tests. And maybe before you had a
[52:02] particular trial, someone else would
[52:05] have gone through something similar and
[52:07] you would have heard them talk about it
[52:08] and you'd have give them scripture to
[52:10] encourage them and you would have tried
[52:12] to set a word of encouragement to help
[52:14] them because you love them. But when
[52:17] that thing turns around and hits you and
[52:20] then you go to experiencing what they
[52:23] went through, isn't it amazing how it
[52:26] illuminates you and how it illuminates
[52:29] me and illuminates us as the people of
[52:32] God? And we go to realizing that just
[52:35] the letter of the word never gave us the
[52:38] full understanding of that situation.
[52:41] Can anybody say amen? Now, there were
[52:43] people who lost husbands and wives and
[52:46] children and things like that to disease
[52:49] or by an automobile accident. And you
[52:51] went to their their viewing and maybe to
[52:54] their funeral and you walked up there
[52:55] and you said, "I'm so sorry. I'm so
[52:57] sorry for your loss. May God help you."
[53:00] And you were doing the best that you
[53:02] knew. But when that same situation
[53:05] happened to you, it brought you into a
[53:08] place of understanding that you never
[53:10] knew. You thought, you knew, and you
[53:13] might have even ventured to say, "I know
[53:16] what you're going through." But once it
[53:18] happened to you, you realize you didn't
[53:21] have a clue what they were going
[53:23] through. You were just trying to say
[53:25] some nice consoling words. And you were
[53:28] saying that those words from something
[53:31] that you meant, something you were
[53:33] sincere about, but you were not saying
[53:35] it from experience. But there's
[53:38] something about experience. Now remember
[53:41] God is the fountain of all pure
[53:44] knowledge, pure wisdom, pure
[53:46] understanding, pure logos of God. And he
[53:49] himself had to experience sickness,
[53:54] death, suffering, loneliness, people
[53:58] treating you wrong, people being mean to
[54:00] you in order for he himself to
[54:04] understand it. That's one of the reasons
[54:06] that he come to the earth so that he
[54:08] could become a high priest. He could
[54:11] have become a high priest by nosis, by
[54:14] knowledge, just by saying, "Okay, I'm
[54:17] God. I I I relate to a degree to what
[54:20] they're going through. They're mortals.
[54:22] They've fallen. They're humans, but they
[54:24] can't be like me." But he knew that
[54:26] would not be sufficient. So he had to
[54:29] allow himself to feel like a man being
[54:33] tempted to do something wrong. He had to
[54:36] allow himself the feeling when he was
[54:39] carried up to the pinnacle of the temple
[54:41] and the devil showed him the kingdoms of
[54:43] the world in a moment of time and when
[54:46] the prophet referred to that in the seal
[54:48] book and he said what a creature. Can
[54:51] you imagine? Satan carried him ahead in
[54:54] the future and showed him Germany. He
[54:57] showed him Europe. He showed him the UK.
[55:00] He showed him all the continent of
[55:02] Africa. He showed him the United States
[55:04] of America. Carried him forth from that
[55:07] time frame around, you know, 30 AD,
[55:09] something like that, all the way up
[55:11] through the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18, 21st
[55:14] century, 22nd, however far it'll go.
[55:17] Showed him every kingdom of the world
[55:19] that would ever be in a moment of time.
[55:22] And Jesus allowed himself as a man to
[55:26] feel the desire to want all of those
[55:30] kingdoms and want all of those thrones
[55:33] and want all of those crowns and show
[55:37] him all the kingdoms of the world in a
[55:39] moment of time. And remember done no
[55:41] good now unless the Lord Jesus would
[55:44] have allowed himself to feel similar to
[55:48] the way you and I feel when we're
[55:50] tempted. either tempted to go away,
[55:53] tempted to rely on our own
[55:55] understanding, tempted to do whatever it
[55:58] is that we're tempted to do wrong by.
[56:00] And once he allowed himself to feel
[56:03] that, then he could step into the office
[56:06] truly of high priest, not Melzdc. Now
[56:10] remember Melazdc is not the office of
[56:13] the mediatorial work. Melchazdc
[56:16] pre-existed the Arenaic priesthood. it
[56:20] it will outlast any priesthood upon the
[56:22] earth. But this is not the reason that
[56:25] he come. Melzdc appeared to Abraham in
[56:28] Genesis 18. So that was not necessary
[56:30] for another reappearing of Melzdc to
[56:33] come in that form. But it must be in the
[56:35] form of a priesthood which could relate
[56:38] to human beings. Melchazdc cannot relate
[56:40] to the temptation of a woman. Melchazdc
[56:43] could not relate to the temptation of a
[56:45] man being tempted to drink alcohol or a
[56:48] woman to dress indecent or ungodly. No
[56:51] way he could. He was not a human. But
[56:54] yet God wanted to become a man that he
[56:57] would be able to feel how we feel. He
[57:00] wanted to feel the embarrassment of
[57:03] temptation, the shame of temptation, the
[57:06] humiliation
[57:08] of living in a body which is unbecoming.
[57:12] you feel humiliated as especially as we
[57:15] get older and we lose our ability to
[57:18] recall and we lose our ability to not
[57:21] remember this and remember that and you
[57:23] get down on your knees and you can't
[57:25] hardly get up again and you old people
[57:27] can say amen if you know what amen is
[57:29] you still remember amen you old folks
[57:31] all right and then these young folks are
[57:33] just sitting here looking at us and
[57:35] smiling like I don't know what don't
[57:37] smile long honey you'll be where we are
[57:39] before long but you see what is that
[57:41] it's a tabernacle of humiliation. You
[57:44] remember, I used to run. I used to be
[57:46] able to do this and that and the other,
[57:48] but now this old body and your mind, you
[57:51] still think you can till you get down
[57:52] there and can't get back up. And then
[57:54] you say, "Well, somebody help me,
[57:56] please." And you realize that your mind
[57:58] and your body, you've still got both of
[58:00] them pretty much, but but the body still
[58:03] just can't do what it used to do.
[58:05] There's a humiliation in that, is there
[58:08] not older people? There's a humiliation
[58:10] in having to ask people to help you do
[58:12] this and help you do that. Used to,
[58:15] brother D. We could do it on our own.
[58:17] Now, can you imagine God entering into
[58:20] the humiliation of this tabernacle
[58:22] called the tabernacle of humiliation?
[58:25] And why did he do it? For your sake. So
[58:28] that he would be able to experience it
[58:30] in the way you do. So he must allow
[58:33] himself to feel it when people would try
[58:36] him. And when the disciples would argue
[58:39] and fuss back and forth who's going to
[58:41] be the greatest, he had to feel that let
[58:44] down and that disappointment. Are you
[58:46] kidding? Am I wasting my time? Am I
[58:49] wasting my time trying to live for these
[58:51] guys and trying to preach to them the
[58:53] truth and they go ahead and do whatever
[58:54] they want to? Anyway, he had to feel
[58:57] that element of humiliation. Now
[59:00] remember this man who God used to write
[59:02] this was one of the greatest examples of
[59:05] weakness that we have in any of the
[59:09] apostles. So he himself had come through
[59:13] the building stage now where he is here
[59:15] in second Peter that he would allow the
[59:18] spirit of God to mature this patience in
[59:22] him. So Peter wasn't just writing some
[59:25] good theological terms, but Peter had
[59:28] allowed this to happen in his own life.
[59:32] God had added one virtue to another to
[59:35] another. I can follow that kind of a
[59:37] man.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; I don't mind telling you friends, I
[59:40] can't I can't take correction from a man
[59:42] I ain't got no confidence in. I just
[59:44] can't do it. No, I cannot do it because
[59:47] preachers is going to have to preach
[59:49] correction. And there will be times they
[59:50] won't have no quote or no scripture to
[59:52] back it up. And if I ain't got
[59:54] confidence in the way that man lives
[59:56] himself, I can't take correction from
[59:57] it. I want to see a man that lives. I
[1:00:00] want to see a man that lives what he
[1:00:03] preaches.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Well, you know, God
[1:00:07] understood exactly the same thing. So
[1:00:10] now, let's look at this man then. What
[1:00:12] he was before he himself got built up
[1:00:16] into the image of the living God. by
[1:00:18] what he has become here in second Peter.
[1:00:20] Now watch him in Matthew chapter 18 21.
[1:00:24] Then came Peter to him. That would do
[1:00:26] you good when you get time to read this
[1:00:28] entire 18th chapter because this
[1:00:30] question comes from the precedent that
[1:00:33] the Lord Jesus had been talking about
[1:00:35] about forgiveness and harmony in the
[1:00:38] body and all that. Now he knew at the
[1:00:39] time of course the disciples could not
[1:00:42] do this. This is only only applicable to
[1:00:45] those who have eternal life. and he knew
[1:00:47] they could not do it yet, but he's
[1:00:49] setting forth the seed. So, Peter hears
[1:00:51] it. And it seems as if though that Jesus
[1:00:54] is saying so much about forgiveness and
[1:00:56] and just, you know, forgiving those that
[1:00:58] do whatever they do to you that Peter
[1:01:00] took it. Now, watch this question. It
[1:01:02] was this as if though that Peter took
[1:01:04] it, oh my goodness, th this is going to
[1:01:06] be greatly abused. Th this is going to
[1:01:10] be abused. So he he takes it on himself
[1:01:13] to try to help the Lord Jesus to clarify
[1:01:16] this. So you read the entire chapter,
[1:01:18] you'll see what I'm saying. So notice
[1:01:20] then came Peter to him and said, "Lord,
[1:01:23] how oft shall I shall my brother sin
[1:01:26] against me and I forgive him?" Now
[1:01:29] notice Peter's question has been set in
[1:01:32] such a way to help clarify all the
[1:01:35] forgiveness and all the love and all the
[1:01:37] mercy that Jesus is talking about. So
[1:01:39] Peter's going to ask him to help Jesus
[1:01:42] to to clarify. You know, well, we've got
[1:01:44] people the same way today, of course,
[1:01:46] and they feel like that they need to
[1:01:48] help bring clarity to the word because
[1:01:50] the word isn't clear enough, but it's
[1:01:52] clear enough. But you know what Peter
[1:01:54] actually done? He opened the door more a
[1:01:55] little more so Jesus could burn his hide
[1:01:58] a little bit more than he already done.
[1:02:00] That's what I found out. We have to be
[1:02:01] kind of careful in the questions that
[1:02:03] we're asking cuz he'll really send you
[1:02:05] if you just keep on going. So sometimes
[1:02:07] you're better off to sit there and act
[1:02:08] like you're done.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now what? So Peter came
[1:02:13] and said, "Lord, how oft shall my
[1:02:15] brother sin against me?" How often? Now
[1:02:17] notice the key word oft. So he's asking,
[1:02:20] "So how frequent shall my brother sin
[1:02:23] against me and me forgive?" Now this
[1:02:25] sounds kind of odd, but yet remember
[1:02:28] Peter was taught by the Jews. This was
[1:02:31] their teaching in this time frame that
[1:02:35] you were to forgive your brothers and
[1:02:37] your sisters at least three times
[1:02:42] but not four.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; So Peter actually doubled this. Now he
[1:02:50] is stretching himself I mean big time.
[1:02:54] So no doubt he could have pounded his
[1:02:56] chest and think man alive Jesus is going
[1:03:00] to be so proud of me. I'm going to go
[1:03:03] beyond the teaching of the Pharisees,
[1:03:05] the Sadducees, the Essenes, the
[1:03:07] Herodians, cuz this was the common
[1:03:09] belief among the majority of the Jews at
[1:03:12] this time frame that you forgive people
[1:03:15] three times. But when they sin against
[1:03:18] you the fourth time, you are not
[1:03:21] obligated to forgive them at all.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Wow. Some of us ain't even Jews and we
[1:03:27] do that. Oh
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; well, praise the Lord. Help us, Jesus.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Now, notice how often
[1:03:41] times now double what he's taught is the
[1:03:45] standard. Double. So, he's going beyond
[1:03:47] it. Now, Jesus is merciful and Jesus is
[1:03:50] grace. So he thinks and is thinking no
[1:03:53] doubt he is going way up here beyond
[1:03:55] what the Pharisees believe. I I found
[1:03:58] this meaning of forgive and I thought it
[1:04:00] was absolutely awesome and I want to
[1:04:02] share it with you. To forgive is to
[1:04:04] treat as though the offense
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; was not committed.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Wow. to declare that we will not harbor
[1:04:19] malice
[1:04:22] or treat unkindly,
[1:04:25] but that the matter shall be buried
[1:04:28] and forgotten.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; So, y'all want me to close now or go on
[1:04:35] a little farther?
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Now, look how different that forgiveness
[1:04:40] really is in compared to what people
[1:04:43] think that it is. So now Peter
[1:04:46] says,"Lord, shall I forgive my brother
[1:04:49] then till seven times?"
[1:04:52] So the Jews then being around him and no
[1:04:55] doubt hearing this and they're saying,
[1:04:57] "Boy, Peter has really Peter has really
[1:05:00] grown since I know him, man." Yeah. I
[1:05:03] mean, this message has really done
[1:05:06] something for Peter.
[1:05:08] Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto
[1:05:12] thee until seven times, but until 70*
[1:05:18] 7.
[1:05:20] Now, revenge
[1:05:22] is natural to the natural man.
[1:05:26] It's something that can come in a
[1:05:29] natural way to human beings because
[1:05:33] unconverted man is a vindictive
[1:05:38] get even being.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Now, some more than others, but some
[1:05:44] will hold grudges for years.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; That's right. And yet claim to be
[1:05:52] Christians and even claim to have the
[1:05:54] Holy Ghost.
[1:05:56] and they will hold a grudge and become
[1:06:00] vindictive. They won't speak to you.
[1:06:02] They won't smile at you. They won't
[1:06:05] shake your hand and claim they're filled
[1:06:08] with the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:10] So why? Because it is natural by man's
[1:06:14] fallen nature to be vindictive. So it's
[1:06:19] very difficult for human beings most of
[1:06:22] them to be able to forgive people of the
[1:06:25] injuries that they placed upon them. Now
[1:06:29] whether they've done a bad business deal
[1:06:31] or they've hurt their feelings and
[1:06:33] they've maybe embarrassed them or you
[1:06:36] know whatever it can be it can it can
[1:06:38] involve many many things. And you're the
[1:06:40] Lord Jesus. I I I would love to have
[1:06:43] seen Peter's face when the Lord Jesus
[1:06:47] says no Peter but I say unto you unto 70
[1:06:52] times of course which is 490 times but
[1:06:56] actually when you understand the Jewish
[1:06:58] language Jesus wasn't just limiting it
[1:07:02] to 490 times you see the sevens come
[1:07:06] into completion which rolls right back
[1:07:10] out into unfathomable
[1:07:13] ends. So in other words, you never stop
[1:07:18] forgiving them.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; So some of you thought seven was bad and
[1:07:28] you thought 490 was worse.
[1:07:31] Let me give you a worse scenario. If you
[1:07:34] like grudges,
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; there is no end
[1:07:39] to forgiveness.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm only talking, of course, to
[1:07:44] people that's born again,
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; not just Christians, not just message
[1:07:48] people and church people, that sort of
[1:07:50] thing. They can never do that. Totally
[1:07:52] impossible.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Totally impossible.
[1:07:57] So, seven sevens, 70* 7 490 times. So
[1:08:02] seven being the completion 490 of course
[1:08:05] added to that. So in other words Peter
[1:08:08] it absolutely once you get born again it
[1:08:11] will never stop. You will actually break
[1:08:15] into a realm of forgiveness that you
[1:08:18] cannot even comprehend. So 490 times in
[1:08:22] one day. Now remember Jesus sets it
[1:08:24] forth in the right angle that if the
[1:08:27] brother comes to you and he states it in
[1:08:29] Luke how that if the man comes to you
[1:08:31] and said forgive me brother I've
[1:08:33] trespassed against you. I'm sorry. And
[1:08:35] then Jesus says then you must forgive
[1:08:37] the man. So how often are we to forgive
[1:08:41] till we get up to 490 times? Any of
[1:08:44] y'all got a tablet on your phone or you
[1:08:46] got a thing that brother Donny sinned
[1:08:48] against me 398 times. I'll tell you one
[1:08:50] thing. He's treading on my mercy. He's
[1:08:52] treading on my forgiveness. Boy, a few
[1:08:54] more times. I'll never have to forgive
[1:08:56] him again. He looked right at me when he
[1:08:58] said that. Who am I supposed to look at
[1:09:00] when I'm preaching? Y'all want me to
[1:09:02] start preaching to the baptistry and you
[1:09:03] see the back of my head all the time? I
[1:09:06] reckon I got to preach to human beings.
[1:09:08] You showed up today.
[1:09:10] Oh my. Well, the deacon spoke to my son.
[1:09:14] I'll tell you one thing. That's 395
[1:09:16] times. They better not do that again.
[1:09:18] I'm running out of patience. But you
[1:09:21] know, when you really get the Holy Ghost
[1:09:23] and you're filled with the spirit of
[1:09:25] God, one of the first things you'll do
[1:09:26] is throw away that pen and paper keeping
[1:09:29] up a record of the trespasses and the
[1:09:31] faults of your brothers and sisters
[1:09:33] because you have broke into a sphere.
[1:09:36] This is why I say, friends, I've said it
[1:09:38] for years. I'm going to keep on saying
[1:09:39] it. One of the biggest lacks in the
[1:09:41] ranks of this message is people that are
[1:09:44] truly born again and filled with the
[1:09:46] Holy Ghost. It's evident. It's evident
[1:09:49] by the way we argue and fuss and debate
[1:09:52] and you get among preachers and they're
[1:09:54] some of the worst ones you ever seen in
[1:09:55] your life. You think you're this
[1:09:57] preacher's best friend and that one's
[1:09:59] best friend and that one's best friend
[1:10:01] until you cross them on their theology.
[1:10:03] Uh-huh. And then when you cross them on
[1:10:06] their theology and you no longer believe
[1:10:08] exactly what they believe on this or
[1:10:10] that, you know what they'll do? They'll
[1:10:11] cut you off. Every move that's been
[1:10:14] around this message has done exactly
[1:10:16] that. You know what? We're not short on
[1:10:18] all kinds of new fang dangled ideas and
[1:10:21] doctrines. But I'll tell you where,
[1:10:22] we're short on the stature of perfect
[1:10:24] men and women of God. We're short on
[1:10:27] forgiveness. We're short on being godly
[1:10:30] like God wants us to be. How easy we
[1:10:33] will ride off our friends and our
[1:10:35] brothers and ride off churches and this
[1:10:38] and that because we disagree and we move
[1:10:41] right on with our little so-called
[1:10:43] revival and we won't even speak to
[1:10:45] people. Preach, Brother Donnie.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; And we treat them as if though they're
[1:10:49] going to hell. Who gave you the idea or
[1:10:52] me the ability to say, "This one's
[1:10:55] bride. This one ain't. This one's
[1:10:56] bride." Ain't none of us got no right to
[1:10:59] say that.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, you imagine now as Peter stands
[1:11:04] there dumbfounded, trying to comprehend
[1:11:07] 490 times and measuring no doubt where
[1:11:11] he was presently was what Jesus spoke
[1:11:15] about. out of future tense. Now, I
[1:11:17] believe with all of my heart that the
[1:11:19] Lord Jesus in using these numbers of
[1:11:22] sevens that he was setting forth a time
[1:11:26] when individuals would arise to the
[1:11:29] sevens in their life. Now remember,
[1:11:32] whenever you start out with f with
[1:11:34] faith, that's on virtual or level one.
[1:11:37] You're climbing level two, three, four,
[1:11:40] five, six, seven, and you come to the
[1:11:42] seventh. Then you're right at the very
[1:11:44] top to where that eight, which is a new
[1:11:48] beginning or eternity. Remember when we
[1:11:51] read these things, there's actually
[1:11:52] eight of them, not seven. There's eight.
[1:11:56] And what is the eighth one? It's
[1:11:58] himself. So it rolls us right back into
[1:12:02] eternity. So where are some of you
[1:12:04] today? 2 3 4 5 6 7 Where are you? You
[1:12:08] know, this is why we need to pray, God,
[1:12:10] help me to see where I am. I believe the
[1:12:13] Lord Jesus in speaking of the perfect
[1:12:16] sevens was pointing to a time to when
[1:12:19] the seventh will arrive. I believe we're
[1:12:22] here. I think that's why Satan is
[1:12:25] fighting every one of us like never
[1:12:27] before. I've never in my life seen the
[1:12:30] children of God going through so much as
[1:12:33] they are. Can anybody witness it that
[1:12:35] today? And your life every way you turn
[1:12:39] so much difficulty but be encouraged
[1:12:42] child of God. The hour is fastly
[1:12:45] approaching when seventh will be
[1:12:48] completed and the eighth will set down
[1:12:50] on the top and we will leave this world
[1:12:53] in a body change.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; I believe it. Don't you? Now 70*
[1:13:00] 7. Let's read if you would in Ephesians
[1:13:03] 4:2. Now watch Paul coming from a little
[1:13:06] bit different perspective there. And he
[1:13:08] said, "With all loneliness and meekness
[1:13:11] with longsuffering
[1:13:14] for bearing one another in love." Look
[1:13:17] at this word different word of course
[1:13:20] than what Peter used. Suffer to bear
[1:13:22] with, to endure, to hold up, to hold
[1:13:26] oneself erect and firm. to sustain, to
[1:13:30] bear, to endure. Now, remember, I'm
[1:13:32] preaching to you this morning on
[1:13:34] patience with one another. When we move
[1:13:37] to that level that we can have patience
[1:13:40] with God and trust him, and then we're
[1:13:42] moving into it a little bit deeper to
[1:13:45] where we can have patience with one
[1:13:47] another and be able to endure one
[1:13:50] another's faults and the way we as
[1:13:52] Christians rub one another the wrong
[1:13:54] way. Now, it's okay for y'all to say,
[1:13:57] "Man, I'm not scared of them." It's okay
[1:13:59] if you can smile a little bit, you know,
[1:14:01] and all that sort of thing. It's all
[1:14:03] right for you to say, "Oh, God, help me.
[1:14:05] I can see you." You know, you're
[1:14:06] grimacing on your face and all that. But
[1:14:09] I do believe we want to get ready for a
[1:14:11] rapture here at Word of Life, right?
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; So, watch. Then, we're talking about us
[1:14:16] being able to be patient with one
[1:14:19] another and our shortcomings and our
[1:14:22] failures. Now watch as as Paul writes
[1:14:24] this with all loneliness and meekness
[1:14:27] and longsuffering forbearing one another
[1:14:31] in love endeavoring to keep the unity of
[1:14:36] the spirit in the bond of peace. Now
[1:14:39] this is the same man that in another
[1:14:42] passage of scripture calls it the bond
[1:14:43] of perfectness. So it was a bond by
[1:14:47] which the body was bound together. And
[1:14:49] you say how in the world is that ever
[1:14:50] going to happen? That ain't up to me.
[1:14:52] That's up to God. God's the one who
[1:14:54] wrote this in his word and we believe he
[1:14:56] will bring it to pass.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[1:15:00] spirit in the bond of peace. So just
[1:15:02] keep in your mind anyone who tries to to
[1:15:05] sow discord and division and and
[1:15:08] intentionally trying to break up the
[1:15:11] body, whether it's a preacher, whoever
[1:15:12] it is, just remember they are not
[1:15:14] working in the spirit of unity or in the
[1:15:17] bond of peace. They're anointed of the
[1:15:20] devil. And Paul warned about it in Acts.
[1:15:22] He said that men would come in and they
[1:15:25] would try to draw people out after
[1:15:28] themselves. And we've had it all down
[1:15:29] through the ages. But they're not
[1:15:31] working in the spirit of unity, but
[1:15:34] trying to divide. Colossians 3:12.
[1:15:38] Put on therefore as the elect of God.
[1:15:42] Okay, now we're moving into bride
[1:15:44] material. We're not talking about
[1:15:46] foolish virgin. We're not talking about
[1:15:47] just church people. We're talking about
[1:15:50] the elect of God. Put on therefore as
[1:15:54] the elect of God, holy and beloved,
[1:15:57] bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness
[1:16:01] of mind, meekness, longsuffering,
[1:16:06] forbearing
[1:16:07] one another, forgiving one another. If
[1:16:12] any man have a quarrel, a quarrel, you
[1:16:16] mean children of God can quarrel?
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If any man have a
[1:16:22] quarrel against any, even as Christ
[1:16:27] forgave you, so do oh my also do ye. So
[1:16:34] how does Christ forgive us?
[1:16:39] He forgives us and then holds a grudge,
[1:16:42] right?
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Really?
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Well, how do we figure we're forgiving
[1:16:48] and being like Christ when we forgive
[1:16:50] and hold grudges?
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; So, when you ask the Lord Jesus to
[1:16:56] forgive you, even though you ask and
[1:16:58] said, "Okay, I'm forgiving you." And
[1:16:59] then the next time you go to pray, he
[1:17:01] reminds you of what he already forgave
[1:17:04] you of.
[1:17:07] But that's the way we do. Now, I've done
[1:17:09] forgive you, brother Jack, for saying
[1:17:10] that. Do I have to keep on forgiving
[1:17:12] you? And then we remind them over and
[1:17:14] over again.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; So, when you husbands and wives get into
[1:17:19] arguments, do you bring up what you've
[1:17:21] already forgive your husband for or your
[1:17:22] wife for?
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Now, remember, and I don't forgive you
[1:17:26] of this 387 times, and you're doing it
[1:17:30] again. Now, you expect me to forgive you
[1:17:32] again? Is that what you tell Harry
[1:17:34] Karen?
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; But we're supposed to forgive now. Only
[1:17:41] the elect.
[1:17:43] Only the elect.
[1:17:46] So, will there be five out of this
[1:17:47] church? 10, 15, I don't know. But I'm
[1:17:51] speaking this this morning as unto the
[1:17:53] elect.
[1:17:55] I don't expect the rest of you to do
[1:17:58] this.
[1:17:59] I don't expect the rest of Christianity
[1:18:01] around the world to only the elect of
[1:18:05] God. This has the Brad's name on it.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; As the elect of God, forbearing one
[1:18:12] another and forgiving one another. If
[1:18:14] any man have a quarrel against any, even
[1:18:17] as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. So
[1:18:22] to forbear, I found the meaning of this
[1:18:24] word was awesome. to forbearest not
[1:18:27] freely to forgive
[1:18:29] but meet halfway
[1:18:34] with an extended hand.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; So even though you have been the one
[1:18:41] trespassed against
[1:18:43] cuz what you find is a lot of people
[1:18:45] that are Christians they have the office
[1:18:48] time ever was saying these two words
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. Yes.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; And then these two other words,
[1:19:02] forgive me.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; And then these other two words, I'm
[1:19:09] wrong.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; But again, I'm just preaching to elect.
[1:19:13] All the rest of you just take whatever
[1:19:15] you want and cut and splice and do
[1:19:17] whatever you want to with it. But I I'm
[1:19:19] speaking this morning to the elect.
[1:19:24] I'm one of them.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Anybody else in your elect of God?
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, Brother Donnie, no, no,
[1:19:30] no. This sermon's for me." Well, good.
[1:19:32] Take it.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Take it. But just don't take it up here.
[1:19:36] Take it in here.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; And become what this word says. Cuz this
[1:19:40] is one of the scriptures that plainly
[1:19:42] identifies itself as elect only.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Oh my. So whenever then, let me read
[1:19:50] this again to to forbear is not just to
[1:19:53] freely forgive, but to meet halfway with
[1:19:57] an extended hand and forgiving one
[1:20:00] another all trespasses and offenses so
[1:20:03] far as committed against themsel. Oh my.
[1:20:07] Notice again Jesus in Matthew 6:12 and
[1:20:11] then this beautiful awesome prayer. and
[1:20:13] forgive us our debts as we forgive our
[1:20:17] debtors.
[1:20:20] You mean so if I don't forgive people
[1:20:23] who trespass against me,
[1:20:26] God doesn't forgive me.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; These words are not up for debate.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; It's the master himself who said them.
[1:20:40] Amen.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; So you mean if I hold something in my
[1:20:44] heart from 13 years ago and somebody
[1:20:48] said something to me, told a lie on me
[1:20:50] or whatever it was they done and I meet
[1:20:53] that person and boy, I see them from
[1:20:55] time to time and I said, "I'll not
[1:20:56] forgive them. Bless God, I'll tell you
[1:20:58] one thing.
[1:21:00] So all the shortcomings, all the
[1:21:03] failures, all the mistakes that I've
[1:21:06] done for the last 13 years
[1:21:10] are still on my account.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz I haven't forgiven. Oh, I want
[1:21:21] God's mercy. Don't you all? I want God
[1:21:23] to forgive me. Oh yes, absolutely. We
[1:21:25] all want that. But Jesus said it.
[1:21:28] Whenever you stand praying,
[1:21:31] our father which art in heaven, hallowed
[1:21:34] be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will
[1:21:37] be done in earth as it is in heaven. You
[1:21:40] remember the prayer. It's beautiful how
[1:21:42] he goes into it. And then he
[1:21:44] incorporates into this about we help us
[1:21:46] to forgive our neighbors their
[1:21:48] trespasses and you forgive us as we
[1:21:51] forgive them. Surely he don't mean it
[1:21:54] literally that way that I'm supposed to
[1:21:57] forgive and if I don't forgive then that
[1:22:00] is against me. Well, I'm afraid he does.
[1:22:04] You see, God's forgiveness is complete
[1:22:07] and final.
[1:22:10] It's not conditional
[1:22:12] or partial.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, I forgive you for this and
[1:22:17] this and this, but this one right here,
[1:22:19] no way there. I mean, there
[1:22:24] Oh my. Colossians chapter 3:14. And
[1:22:28] above all these things,
[1:22:33] put on charity.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Above
[1:22:37] all these things. Above
[1:22:39] all these things. Above.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Above what? Faith, virtue, knowledge,
[1:22:45] temperance, all these things. Right at
[1:22:47] the very top.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Charity.
[1:22:54] which is the bond
[1:22:56] of perfectness.
[1:22:59] So when the sister has the dream and the
[1:23:01] prophet tells us about it invites Femius
[1:23:04] names
[1:23:06] and she sees a man up on the mountain
[1:23:10] and there was a rock box upon the
[1:23:13] mountain
[1:23:14] and the man was pouring water in the box
[1:23:19] and water was flooding out of the box
[1:23:22] and running down the sides of the
[1:23:25] mountain.
[1:23:28] And then
[1:23:30] honey started being poured into the box.
[1:23:36] I I find this awesome.
[1:23:39] And as the honey started going into the
[1:23:42] box, it changed the consistency. Of
[1:23:44] course, you know what honey is? It's
[1:23:46] sticky.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Sticky.
[1:23:53] Our church needs some more stickiness.
[1:23:58] Not sticky to the world. We got too much
[1:24:01] of that. But sticky to one another.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to notice that a prophet
[1:24:10] has the ability to resee a dream. And he
[1:24:13] did. He resaw this sister's dream. And
[1:24:16] he he interprets it. So the man on the
[1:24:19] top was pouring the water into the box.
[1:24:23] And he said that man was the messenger
[1:24:26] of the age.
[1:24:28] Now can you imagine the prophet sees
[1:24:30] himself in that in that dream which
[1:24:33] interpreted turned around was a vision.
[1:24:35] So he sees himself pouring the water in
[1:24:38] the box and the water was flooding out.
[1:24:41] Now the spirit of God can do that the
[1:24:43] waters of life and it can come down and
[1:24:46] just go down the sides and flow
[1:24:48] everywhere. But sometimes you need more
[1:24:50] than that in order to bring the body to
[1:24:53] the unification that God requires for
[1:24:55] the resurrection. So then the contents
[1:24:59] was changed coming from where from under
[1:25:02] the oposes of the same messenger. But it
[1:25:05] was the contents of what was being
[1:25:07] poured into the box the second time that
[1:25:10] would start coming out and running all
[1:25:12] over it. And what was it doing? It was
[1:25:15] cementing it all together cuz water will
[1:25:19] not cement the levels. But honey is
[1:25:22] sticky. So the honey coming into the box
[1:25:26] and it held inside of there and the
[1:25:28] spirit of God going down the side,
[1:25:31] that's you, friends.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; That's you. It's our church.
[1:25:37] It's our age. The spirit of God
[1:25:40] cementing us together.
[1:25:44] I'm afraid that some of us have the
[1:25:46] wrong idea of what the bride will be in
[1:25:48] the last days. That every church in the
[1:25:51] message and every preacher will be
[1:25:53] dotting their eyes exactly the same and
[1:25:55] crossing their tees. I I I just do not
[1:25:57] believe that's scriptural. I do not
[1:25:59] believe that's the message. I believe
[1:26:00] that we will agree on the things
[1:26:03] required for the rapture and the body
[1:26:06] change. And there will be personal
[1:26:09] individual things about us that will
[1:26:11] differ from our church to the other
[1:26:13] church to the other church. If we would
[1:26:15] all sit down and go to talking about the
[1:26:17] message on election, serpent seed,
[1:26:19] predestination, and you might have one
[1:26:21] idea different than mine and me have one
[1:26:23] different than you. Is everybody around
[1:26:25] the world going to come into agreement
[1:26:27] with your idea? The thing of it is we
[1:26:30] want to come into agreement with God.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Whatever God requires, that's what I
[1:26:35] want. Is you? Not so much you. I'm not
[1:26:38] trying to build you all where you all
[1:26:40] come into saying everything brother
[1:26:42] Donnie says that ain't nothing but a yes
[1:26:44] man. God wants you to be a yes man to
[1:26:47] himself, not to preachers.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; And you don't He don't want us to be yes
[1:26:52] people to you. But what does God want?
[1:26:55] He wants that spirit of God being there.
[1:26:57] We'll get into it on brotherly kindness
[1:26:59] that the prophet said that if something
[1:27:01] happens between you and a brother and
[1:27:04] then you you know the brother maybe the
[1:27:05] brother is taken out of the earth and he
[1:27:07] said you hear about it and you feel so
[1:27:10] bad in your heart because something come
[1:27:13] between you and that brother and you
[1:27:15] never was able to get to him and make
[1:27:17] that right. He said what is it brotherly
[1:27:20] kindness? He said it sticks. It sticks.
[1:27:24] It holds it there. Now, the human
[1:27:26] differences will always be there.
[1:27:28] There's probably not a preacher in this
[1:27:30] church that agrees with every view that
[1:27:32] I have. Every deacon in the church
[1:27:34] probably don't agree with every view
[1:27:36] that I have. That don't mean we're not
[1:27:38] brothers. That don't mean that we're not
[1:27:40] going in the rapture and the chains of
[1:27:42] the body. Come on, somebody. Don't you
[1:27:44] see what Satan has done? He's warped our
[1:27:46] our understanding of what unity is. And
[1:27:49] we're thinking, look at Peter and Paul
[1:27:51] and James. My goodness. You imagine Paul
[1:27:54] whenever him and Barnabas had a
[1:27:56] disagreement and they could not
[1:27:58] reconcile that thing and Barnabas went
[1:28:00] one direction and Paul went another.
[1:28:02] Barnabas is never mentioned again in the
[1:28:05] scripture. Never mentioned again. I
[1:28:08] cannot believe in my heart that those
[1:28:10] men never made that thing right between
[1:28:13] one another. Come on somebody. But
[1:28:15] whatever it was that come between them
[1:28:18] and they just felt it would be the best
[1:28:20] if they didn't work together no more.
[1:28:22] What did Paul do? He took Silas. Oh,
[1:28:24] Silas. I don't know if he had second
[1:28:26] regrets or not. You know, he's beat and
[1:28:27] thrown in jail. He might not have been,
[1:28:29] but you never know. But you look at
[1:28:31] great men like that and they had their
[1:28:33] differences and the water run all out.
[1:28:36] But what hell the honey between them?
[1:28:39] What is it that'll help tie us one to
[1:28:41] another? This is why that we must have
[1:28:44] the baptism of the Holy Ghost permeating
[1:28:47] our entire being. If all we have is
[1:28:50] bubble dancing and jumping and shouting
[1:28:52] and the move of the spirit of God, the
[1:28:54] least little thing come up among us and
[1:28:56] we'll divide ways. Well, we'll start
[1:28:58] another church. We'll go down the road
[1:29:00] and start another group. Well, we're not
[1:29:01] separate. We're not fellowshipping with
[1:29:03] them no more. You know what? That's a
[1:29:05] sign of water running all down the sides
[1:29:07] of the pyramid. But what we need is a
[1:29:10] good baptism of honey. Boy, can you
[1:29:12] imagine be baptized in honey and you
[1:29:15] barely can get up, move around. Glory to
[1:29:17] God. You're so sticky. And you get
[1:29:19] around one another and say, "I'm going
[1:29:20] for lunch." Or, "I'm going with you cuz
[1:29:22] I can't let go." Well, hallelujah. I'm
[1:29:24] going through that trial. I'm going with
[1:29:26] you cuz I'm stuck. We're too watery. We
[1:29:29] need to be a little bit more sticky one
[1:29:31] to another to try to reach out to one
[1:29:33] another, pray for one another, bear one
[1:29:36] another's burdens, and so fulfill the
[1:29:38] law of Christ. And the church said,
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; notice when John wrote this in 1 John
[1:29:45] chapter 2:6, and he said, "He that
[1:29:47] saith, he abideth in him ought himself
[1:29:52] also so to walk even as he walked." Now
[1:29:56] listen, this is overwhelming, friends.
[1:29:58] John introduced this amazing truth that
[1:30:02] the incarnation, the work of incarnation
[1:30:06] of deity has not ended. He that saith,
[1:30:11] notice this, that he abideth in him
[1:30:13] ought himself also, so to walk, even as
[1:30:18] he walks. So a person who truly received
[1:30:21] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their
[1:30:24] soul, they are the incarnation of the
[1:30:27] living God in bride form. This is the
[1:30:30] living tabernacle of the living God. Not
[1:30:34] just people that just oh my live like
[1:30:36] the world and act like the world and
[1:30:38] God's a million miles from them. That's
[1:30:40] not a work of incarnation. It's the same
[1:30:43] Jesus in bride form. You see Jesus
[1:30:47] perfectly expressed the reality of God
[1:30:51] in a human form. The reality of God in a
[1:30:56] human form. A God that could love. A God
[1:30:58] that could forgive. and yet not a God
[1:31:01] that compromised and let everything go.
[1:31:03] That's what the bride's going to be when
[1:31:04] she leaves this world. Notice Jesus says
[1:31:07] it this way in St. John 13:34. A new
[1:31:10] commandment I give unto you that you
[1:31:13] love one another as your daddy said
[1:31:16] you're supposed to do or as your mama
[1:31:19] said or as your uncle.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; This is your example and mine.
[1:31:26] A new commandment I give unto you, that
[1:31:28] you love one another, as I
[1:31:32] have loved you,
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; as I have loved you. Praise God. That
[1:31:40] you also love one another. By this
[1:31:45] shall all men know that ye are my
[1:31:49] disciples. If you have tongues,
[1:31:51] interpretation, prophecy, big church,
[1:31:55] big ministry,
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; no.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:31:59] By this shall all men know that you are
[1:32:01] my disciples,
[1:32:03] not Christians by name, but disciples,
[1:32:08] people that are disciplined by the
[1:32:11] spirit of God. By this shall all men
[1:32:13] know that ye are my disciples. Oh my. If
[1:32:17] you have love one to another. 1 John
[1:32:20] 3:14.
[1:32:22] We know that we have passed from death
[1:32:25] unto life. Because our sisters quit
[1:32:28] cutting their hair and they wear long
[1:32:30] dresses and the men no longer will do
[1:32:32] this and that and the other. All that
[1:32:33] comes with it. But that's not the way
[1:32:35] you know you're born again.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Because we love the brethren. Now, why
[1:32:40] is that such a marvel? Because we've got
[1:32:42] brethren that aren't very lovable. And
[1:32:45] we've got sisters that aren't very
[1:32:47] lovable. And sometimes they got
[1:32:48] preachers that ain't very lovable. But
[1:32:50] the love of God loves those who aren't
[1:32:53] lovable. And let's just face the fact.
[1:32:55] Some folks are more lovable than others.
[1:32:57] But the spirit of God can look at them
[1:33:00] and love them in such a way that you
[1:33:02] look beyond their faults. Sure, you know
[1:33:04] they're there. Their difficulties are
[1:33:06] there. But the love of God in you will
[1:33:09] make you love me as if though I was
[1:33:12] perfect. Right.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Whoa. Did I say a mouthful? Where in the
[1:33:17] world did that come from?
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; The love of God in us will make us love
[1:33:25] one another as if though we have
[1:33:27] arrived.
[1:33:33] [Music]
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; We know that we have passed from death
[1:33:38] unto life because we love the brethren.
[1:33:41] He that loveth not his brother
[1:33:46] lives abideth
[1:33:49] in death.
[1:33:52] Oh my goodness. Friends,
[1:33:55] your long-haired sisters, you dress your
[1:33:57] brothers, you got your clean cut, you
[1:34:00] know, you don't dress like the world,
[1:34:01] act like the world. But if you don't
[1:34:03] love your brother, you live in death.
[1:34:07] you abide
[1:34:09] in death. Whosoever hateth his brother
[1:34:15] is a murderer.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; And you know that no murderer
[1:34:22] as eternal life abiding in him.
[1:34:26] Although all Christianity knows John
[1:34:29] 3:16,
[1:34:30] but how many of them knows first John
[1:34:33] 3:16?
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Let's read it. here power perceive we
[1:34:38] the love of God because he laid down his
[1:34:40] life for us.
[1:34:43] This could not be said when Jesus quoted
[1:34:45] John 3:16.
[1:34:47] This part could only be said after Acts
[1:34:50] 2.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hereby perceive we the love of
[1:34:56] God, because he laid down his life for
[1:34:59] us,
[1:35:01] and we
[1:35:03] ought to lay down our lives.
[1:35:08] Help us, Jesus.
[1:35:13] So, somebody walked in the back door
[1:35:15] this morning with an AK-47
[1:35:19] and said, "I'm going to kill somebody in
[1:35:21] this church today."
[1:35:24] And since the preacher's up on the
[1:35:25] platform, I said, "Go do him cuz he's
[1:35:27] the biggest troublemaker probably."
[1:35:30] And many of you would stand up say, "No,
[1:35:32] don't take him. Take me.
[1:35:37] He reaches more people than I do." And
[1:35:39] he helps more people than I do. Take me.
[1:35:42] Take me.
[1:35:45] But what would be our first reaction?
[1:35:48] The human part.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Hide.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Fear. Right.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; So somebody walked in the door and it
[1:35:56] would be your first reaction to get down
[1:35:57] the seat. Hide. How many would think
[1:36:00] about me standing up here? A wide open
[1:36:02] target. Not many.
[1:36:05] Because fear would dominate.
[1:36:09] So you think when we truly receive God's
[1:36:12] love in the measure that the Lord wants
[1:36:14] us to that we would look at it in such a
[1:36:16] way and and say I wasn't up here say it
[1:36:18] was another brother preaching that he
[1:36:21] just happens to be not one of your
[1:36:23] favorites
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; oh brother Dona I would do it for you
[1:36:30] brother I'd do it for you well thank you
[1:36:34] but what that what about that brother in
[1:36:36] the church that you really don't like
[1:36:37] hearing ing as much.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. Maybe the Lord's
[1:36:42] going to get him out of the way every
[1:36:43] time he preaches. I don't like hearing
[1:36:44] him know how.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Take him out, Jesus. Take him to his
[1:36:48] reward.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Or what if it was a deacon brother that
[1:36:56] got on your little girl before church or
[1:36:59] Sunday school teacher or something like
[1:37:01] that?
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Hereby perceive we the love of God, for
[1:37:06] he laid down his life for us. Therefore,
[1:37:07] if we have the love of God in us, then
[1:37:10] we ought to lay down our lives. Lay
[1:37:13] down, not just pull money out of your
[1:37:16] wallet or out of your purse. Here,
[1:37:17] brother, go buy you some lunch here,
[1:37:19] brother. This is to help with your
[1:37:21] electric bill and think, "Boy, I've done
[1:37:22] my religion." No, you haven't,
[1:37:26] Brother Donnie. Would I ever be called
[1:37:27] to do that? Most of us will not.
[1:37:31] It's not like that. God will demand each
[1:37:33] of you that you're going to be in a
[1:37:35] scenario similar what I described. and
[1:37:37] each of you will be faced with death.
[1:37:41] But he just wants to know you'd be
[1:37:44] willing to do it.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; You see, Abraham didn't have to offer
[1:37:49] Isaac,
[1:37:51] but just being willing to do it just
[1:37:54] meant so much to Almighty God.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; It's not that he will demand some of
[1:38:01] these requirements that others will have
[1:38:04] to give their life. There's still
[1:38:05] martyrs, you know, that's giving their
[1:38:07] life for Christianity. Not even
[1:38:09] necessarily the message, but just to be
[1:38:10] a Christian. And it don't mean that all
[1:38:13] of us will be faced with that. But I
[1:38:16] imagine what it means to the Lord Jesus
[1:38:18] whenever we say, "Lord, if you would
[1:38:20] want me to do it, I would be willing."
[1:38:22] He said, "That's all I want to hear.
[1:38:24] That's all I want to hear. And I know
[1:38:26] your heart well enough to know that if
[1:38:28] it come right down to it, you would give
[1:38:30] your life for your brother or your
[1:38:33] sister.
[1:38:37] Oh my.
[1:38:40] But who so hath this world's good, and
[1:38:42] seeth his brother have need,
[1:38:46] and shutth up his bowels of compassion,
[1:38:50] from him? How dwelleth
[1:38:54] the love of God in him? My little
[1:38:57] children, let us not love in word. Ah,
[1:39:02] here we go.
[1:39:04] Let us not love in logos alone saying
[1:39:07] it. I love everybody. Praise God. I love
[1:39:11] them. I love them.
[1:39:14] But indeed
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; and in truth.
[1:39:20] And hereby we know that we are of the
[1:39:22] truth
[1:39:24] and shall assure our hearts before him.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Can I have a few more minutes?
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:39:33] just a few. Right?
[1:39:36] If you won't be honest with your
[1:39:37] brother, you'll never be honest with
[1:39:39] God.
[1:39:42] You see, you've got to be honest with
[1:39:43] one another. And so, you do that and
[1:39:45] you'll be honest with God. Treat your
[1:39:48] brother just like you want
[1:39:52] to treat him. So, you treat your brother
[1:39:55] just like you want to treat him. Images
[1:39:57] of Christ. No matter where you are, it
[1:40:00] makes a new life. It brings a new image.
[1:40:02] and makes a servant out of you. You want
[1:40:04] to serve him. Jesus wants us to serve
[1:40:07] one another. Love one another. Now
[1:40:10] listen friends. People don't believe
[1:40:12] this.
[1:40:14] As we serve one another,
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; we serve him.
[1:40:22] you sisters, the funeral dinners and the
[1:40:25] things that you do to try to bring
[1:40:27] comfort to the hearts of people that
[1:40:29] have lost a loved one.
[1:40:32] How many of you sisters would have felt
[1:40:34] so honored 2,000 years ago to be able to
[1:40:37] cook a meal for Jesus?
[1:40:42] And remember, Jesus would have been more
[1:40:44] similar to people that stands on the
[1:40:47] exit there coming off of Elizabeth and
[1:40:49] Highway onto University Parkway sitting
[1:40:53] there with the signs up. I'm hungry. I'm
[1:40:55] a veteran or whatever they are. You
[1:40:56] don't know if they are if they ain't
[1:40:58] remember Jesus more than likely would
[1:41:00] not have look like me today.
[1:41:03] Welldressed
[1:41:04] like you brothers are here today.
[1:41:07] Jesus only had one garment. So they say
[1:41:12] he didn't have a house, no horse, no
[1:41:15] chariot,
[1:41:17] no way to be transported back and forth.
[1:41:19] As a matter of fact, we would have
[1:41:21] categorically placed Jesus in this
[1:41:23] category today as a homeless person.
[1:41:33] So Jesus didn't have access to taking a
[1:41:35] bath maybe every day,
[1:41:38] dust on his feet, sweat running down his
[1:41:41] face, and the dust accumulating, and
[1:41:43] you'd seen dirty spots maybe on Jesus'
[1:41:46] face and on his hands.
[1:41:50] I hope you can grasp it. And if you'd
[1:41:52] have got around him, Jesus might have
[1:41:54] had a little bit of a human body odor.
[1:41:59] until he could get his next bath.
[1:42:03] So would he be the type of individual
[1:42:05] that a lot of us would have even give
[1:42:07] the time of day to? Now remember this
[1:42:10] was not that he didn't have access. He
[1:42:14] had access to the wealth of eternity.
[1:42:17] But he laid it aside
[1:42:19] to come here to be like us.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; He bore my stench.
[1:42:25] Yes.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; He bore my humiliation,
[1:42:29] my embarrassment.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Donnie, this embarrasses
[1:42:33] me for you to say this is the way we
[1:42:34] should be. Well, good. I'm glad it does
[1:42:38] because this is true Christianity.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; He bore our embarrassment and we
[1:42:43] willingly bear his.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; How do you don't expect people to do
[1:42:47] this? I don't. God does.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; God does.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Notice this. The prophet says, "I
[1:42:55] realize as I treat the people,
[1:42:58] I'm treating God.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Just my attitude toward you
[1:43:07] is my attitude toward Christ.
[1:43:11] And your attitude towards me
[1:43:15] is the same thing." That's right.
[1:43:18] Toward Christ.
[1:43:23] Oh my. Again, I remind you this is bride
[1:43:28] stuff.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; This separates message people from the
[1:43:32] bride. Remember, we've got a twin. She
[1:43:36] looks so much like us. She'll quote from
[1:43:39] the same books.
[1:43:41] She'll scream and holler and shout.
[1:43:44] Oh yeah. Sometimes even have miracles
[1:43:46] among some of them.
[1:43:48] But when it comes to this type of
[1:43:50] preaching where the rubber meets the
[1:43:51] road and your life has to line up, we're
[1:43:53] deeper than that. We don't need that.
[1:43:55] Glory to God. We're in this great
[1:43:56] mystery and this great thing. When we
[1:43:59] get deeper than this, you're way too
[1:44:01] deep for me.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; This is what my Jesus come to bring us.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Let me close here
[1:44:10] again. He says, "The way I treat you,
[1:44:14] that's my attitude toward God.
[1:44:17] I've often wondered what I would do if I
[1:44:19] had a little charger
[1:44:22] and I had two drops of the literal blood
[1:44:25] of Jesus that fell at Calvary.
[1:44:28] How I would embrace that? How I would
[1:44:31] hold it close?
[1:44:34] Now, can you imagine if this little
[1:44:36] bottle that didn't have body armor in
[1:44:39] it, but it had the literal blood
[1:44:43] of the Lord Jesus?
[1:44:47] And it had been placed in my hands.
[1:44:51] And y'all saw it brought up here and set
[1:44:53] down. I said, "Oh, Brother T, be
[1:44:55] careful. Be careful. That's the blood of
[1:44:59] the Lord Jesus.
[1:45:01] Brother Donn, your hand come really
[1:45:03] close to knocking." And be careful,
[1:45:04] brother D. That's the blood of the Lord
[1:45:06] Jesus.
[1:45:11] I hope you can understand that actually
[1:45:15] you are worth more than his literal
[1:45:19] blood.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; You say how can you say that?
[1:45:27] Because he gave his literal blood
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; for you.
[1:45:32] We'll dismiss it a little bit and y'all
[1:45:34] will go out to wherever you're going to
[1:45:35] eat lunch and you'll sit there and look
[1:45:36] at the menu and you know a t-bone cost
[1:45:39] this much and a ribe eyes this and
[1:45:41] chicken tenders and whatever it is and
[1:45:43] you'll sit there and process and
[1:45:44] evaluate is that worth that to me. Nah,
[1:45:47] I don't believe it is. I really like
[1:45:48] that lobster tail, but man, I ain't
[1:45:50] going to pay that much tail off that
[1:45:51] outfit. Ain't no way I'm buying that.
[1:45:53] I'll do without it this time. I'll
[1:45:54] forfeit. I really like that cheesecake,
[1:45:56] but it costs too much. So, what are you
[1:45:58] doing? You're evaluating your wallet and
[1:46:01] your balance of your budget to you
[1:46:03] getting that. And the Lord Jesus looked
[1:46:06] at his budget and said, "I budget
[1:46:10] myself.
[1:46:12] All eternity, all love,
[1:46:15] all mercy, all kindness, all grace.
[1:46:19] This is my budget for redemption.
[1:46:24] I give everything."
[1:46:28] So he exchanged his blood for you.
[1:46:32] Faulty.
[1:46:33] My goodness.
[1:46:36] How many issues have we caused him?
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Now, many of you like me, you've been
[1:46:40] serving God a whole lot longer than you
[1:46:41] live for the devil.
[1:46:44] I've caused God pain.
[1:46:46] Oh, no. I I'd hate to even think about
[1:46:50] it. I'd hate to even think about what
[1:46:52] I've done to him.
[1:46:55] And yet he looked at me before the world
[1:46:57] began and say, "I see these decades of
[1:46:59] his life.
[1:47:01] He'll struggle with this and he won't
[1:47:03] want to preach." And even when he gives
[1:47:05] into preaching, he won't want to preach
[1:47:06] that and he won't want to preach that.
[1:47:08] And oh boy, if it'd been people that
[1:47:12] said, "Forget it."
[1:47:15] But the thing of it is, he looked at
[1:47:17] every one of us and saw, I see their
[1:47:19] issues. I see this. I see that. I see
[1:47:21] that. But what I see is
[1:47:25] when time wraps up and is folded and
[1:47:29] this little hickey down at the bottom
[1:47:33] called the loop of time.
[1:47:35] When this little hickey falls back into
[1:47:39] eternity and the little hickey is
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; pulled back up into the circle,
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; I see they will be with me through the
[1:47:49] ceaseless ages.
[1:47:52] The mortality, their issues, their
[1:47:54] problems
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; will be all gone.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; And this is my budget.
[1:48:02] I give it all. Amen.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Bham said, "Do you know in the
[1:48:13] sight of God, he's talking about the
[1:48:15] blood now, how I would embrace that, how
[1:48:18] close I would walk with it that I didn't
[1:48:21] drop it or anything. Do you know on the
[1:48:24] side of God, I've got a greater than
[1:48:26] that before me tonight?
[1:48:30] I've got the purchase
[1:48:34] of his blood.
[1:48:36] So when you buy your car,
[1:48:40] you consider the value, your foods, your
[1:48:43] house, all that you buy and barter and
[1:48:45] trade, all that you buy. You consider it
[1:48:49] and you look at you saying, "It's worth
[1:48:51] it to me. It's worth it. I It's worth it
[1:48:54] to me to pay more to to drive a
[1:48:56] Cadillac. I mean, you know, you can
[1:48:58] drive a little whatever more, but it's
[1:49:00] worth it to me to have a little bit more
[1:49:02] room. It's worth it to me to have a push
[1:49:04] button window and a push button this and
[1:49:06] a push button that. It's worth it. And
[1:49:07] people look up say, "Wow, what a nice
[1:49:09] car, man. Wow. Wow. Boy, you must be
[1:49:11] really doing good. Wow, what a nice
[1:49:13] car." Say, "It's worth it to me to have
[1:49:15] power windows. It's worth it to me to
[1:49:17] have an air conditioner. It's worth it
[1:49:18] to me."
[1:49:20] And Jesus looked at each one of us and
[1:49:22] said, "It's worth it to me
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; to deal with John's shortcomings.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; I see what he'll be. It's worth it to me
[1:49:32] to deal with Ry's failures,
[1:49:36] Harry's and Lances, Dows,
[1:49:39] my daughters. It's worth it to me to
[1:49:41] deal with Malachi
[1:49:45] cuz I see what I can make out of him."
[1:49:50] So, do you understand what I have before
[1:49:51] me today?
[1:49:54] I have a value that I have preached to
[1:49:56] today, which the Lord Jesus says,
[1:49:58] "Donnie, handle them with my love."
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Yep. You're going to have to correct
[1:50:04] him. He may have to say things even be
[1:50:06] sharp, but keep the purchase price
[1:50:10] before you.
[1:50:12] Keep the way I value. When you have to
[1:50:15] rebuke them, rebuke them with my love,
[1:50:18] not anxiety, not anger, not frustration.
[1:50:23] Treat them as a shepherd with his sheep.
[1:50:27] And there'll be times, Donnie, you'll
[1:50:29] have to take them up in your arms and
[1:50:31] you'll have to break the legs and it
[1:50:34] will break your heart when you do.
[1:50:37] But be sure after you break it to take
[1:50:40] it up into your arms and love on it. Cuz
[1:50:46] Donnie, the way I look at it,
[1:50:49] to me they were worse
[1:50:51] more than my blood.
[1:50:54] I screamed. I cried.
[1:50:58] I felt the agony.
[1:51:00] And I would have done it for just one of
[1:51:03] them.
[1:51:05] Hallelujah.
[1:51:13] He loved you more than he loved his own
[1:51:17] life.
[1:51:19] He gave his life for you. So, how must I
[1:51:22] handle you? I must be honest
[1:51:27] and sincere.
[1:51:31] Think about that. The next time you go
[1:51:34] to say something to the brothers and
[1:51:36] sisters you go to church with,
[1:51:41] The next time somebody wrongs you, I'm
[1:51:43] going to give them a piece of my mind,
[1:51:45] you might ought to think about that.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; And remember, you're talking to the
[1:51:50] purchase of the blood of the Lord Jesus.
[1:51:53] And as you're giving them a piece of
[1:51:55] your mind, just remember as you're
[1:51:58] talking to them, Jesus takes it
[1:52:01] personally.
[1:52:03] And your attitude toward them is your
[1:52:05] attitude toward the Lord Jesus. So, you
[1:52:07] might as well walk up before the throne
[1:52:08] of God and just go ahead and give Jesus
[1:52:10] a piece of your mind
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; cuz that's the way he looks at it.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Let me close. After all, I'd rather have
[1:52:21] the love of God sealed into my heart
[1:52:25] than all the gifts there is in the
[1:52:27] Bible. Now, this doesn't replace gifts,
[1:52:31] but it just puts it in the proper value.
[1:52:38] I thought of that here a few nights ago.
[1:52:39] My little girl called me and I told her
[1:52:41] she wanted me to come home to her. She
[1:52:43] loves me. And I said, "Oh, I I told her
[1:52:47] I sent her a little doll,
[1:52:51] but she didn't want the doll."
[1:52:56] She said, "I want you, daddy.
[1:53:02] Not your dog."
[1:53:07] Well, that's okay. That's That's the way
[1:53:09] I think about Jesus.
[1:53:12] I love his gifts and the things to help
[1:53:15] his people,
[1:53:18] but I want Jesus.
[1:53:35] Oh Jesus, forgive us.
[1:53:46] That's the way I think about Jesus. I
[1:53:48] love his gifts and things to help his
[1:53:50] people.
[1:53:53] But I want Jesus, the love of God,
[1:53:54] sealed in your heart, pressed in until
[1:53:56] all the world's pressed out,
[1:53:59] and you see nothing but the Lord. And as
[1:54:01] you love one another, you love the Lord.
[1:54:05] And if you don't love one another, you
[1:54:08] can't love the Lord.
[1:54:11] He said so. and God can't move
[1:54:18] into you.
[1:54:22] Children, do we realize when we hold on
[1:54:24] to our grudges and resentments and
[1:54:25] things that we're hindering God from
[1:54:29] moving into us in the way he wants to
[1:54:34] cuz he will not reside in your heart and
[1:54:36] in your soul with resentment,
[1:54:40] unforgiving spirit and all that sort of
[1:54:42] thing.
[1:54:46] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:54:50] I wonder how many here today would like
[1:54:53] to be remembered before the Lord. Lord
[1:54:55] Jesus, my hands are up. Father,
[1:55:02] can you just raise your heads for just a
[1:55:03] moment? Let me show this one more with
[1:55:06] you. Brothers and sisters, I'm down here
[1:55:08] to Total Deliverance 1959.
[1:55:11] And when one member would talk against
[1:55:13] the other member, you know that's wrong.
[1:55:18] You're commanded to pray for one another
[1:55:21] and not talk against one another, but to
[1:55:24] love one another. And if someone is
[1:55:26] down,
[1:55:28] let's pick him up and help him.
[1:55:33] That makes us a unified group of
[1:55:35] believers.
[1:55:37] Now, when we don't do that,
[1:55:40] when we don't obey God,
[1:55:45] we displease God.
[1:55:52] This is one thing that'll make the bride
[1:55:55] so different than her twin.
[1:55:59] The trend twin will divide and separate
[1:56:02] and even use quotes to do it. Build
[1:56:05] kingdoms and
[1:56:07] interested in you following this man or
[1:56:09] that man.
[1:56:11] But the bride just goes through all of
[1:56:13] it and holds her head above the
[1:56:14] fanaticism that followed this revival
[1:56:16] which had to come and she looks at both
[1:56:19] sides arguing and fussing and say God be
[1:56:22] merciful to them and God help me that I
[1:56:25] don't become contaminated
[1:56:27] with such
[1:56:30] you love him with all your heart today.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; How many wants to be a living image
[1:56:38] of the living God?
[1:56:41] to stand our feet.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, we worship you, Jesus.
[1:56:58] We worship you, Jesus.
[1:57:01] Oh Lord, we love your gifts.
[1:57:04] We thank you for every gift you've
[1:57:06] promised in your word.
[1:57:09] But we've done seen what gifts do
[1:57:11] without love.
[1:57:13] Gifts divide.
[1:57:16] They separate.
[1:57:19] Your prophet said gifts can bring
[1:57:21] confusion. We've seen it.
[1:57:27] I just never thought we'd ever arrive to
[1:57:29] where we are now. Lord,
[1:57:32] that what I saw in Pentecost, how gifts
[1:57:34] divided the people then, I never thought
[1:57:37] it'd ever return in the message.
[1:57:42] Gifts are dividing brothers, gifts
[1:57:45] dividing churches,
[1:57:47] gifts dividing family members one from
[1:57:50] the other.
[1:57:52] How sad.
[1:57:56] And the prophet never did get the
[1:57:58] majority of the Pentecostal straightened
[1:58:00] out in their gifts. And we look at it
[1:58:02] and think, "You mean to tell me we're
[1:58:05] living through that same cycle again?"
[1:58:07] And we wonder why we aren't gone. It's
[1:58:09] no wonder we aren't gone.
[1:58:13] We've got to come to where the evening
[1:58:15] light, which is the fourth light, so
[1:58:18] shines in our soul
[1:58:20] that it can put our arms around those
[1:58:22] who believe in this and
[1:58:25] we'll argue with the other brother and
[1:58:27] put our arms around that one and say,
[1:58:28] "Brothers, we're brothers." That's the
[1:58:30] spirit the prophet messenger had.
[1:58:35] Help us, Lord.
[1:58:38] Oh, Jesus.
[1:58:41] May such a baptism of love strike our
[1:58:44] church,
[1:58:46] strike me, oh God,
[1:58:49] strike our minister, brothers,
[1:58:52] every musician.
[1:58:54] May it not only strike us but every
[1:58:56] church around the world, oh God,
[1:59:00] who contains members of your elect.
[1:59:04] Oh Jesus, we worship you today, Father.
[1:59:10] Maybe there's someone here today out of
[1:59:11] fellowship with God. Maybe you've never
[1:59:14] known him. Or maybe you've backslid
[1:59:17] and you'd like to be remembered today.
[1:59:22] Every head bowed, no one looking around.
[1:59:24] Is there anyone in that state and you'd
[1:59:27] like to be remembered? Maybe somebody
[1:59:28] that's backslid, somebody away from the
[1:59:30] Lord. God bless you up in the mezzanine
[1:59:33] there. Amen. Another one there. God
[1:59:36] bless you.
[1:59:39] I tell you friends, we're living in such
[1:59:40] a frightening time. Have you noticed in
[1:59:43] the last few years how rare it is for
[1:59:47] people to come to God?
[1:59:50] That sister that come here just the
[1:59:52] other night after the service, my heart,
[1:59:54] I I was overwhelmed with such a flood of
[1:59:57] emotions. I imagine you could probably
[1:59:59] see it on my face cuz I was trying to
[2:00:01] stand and recall how long it had been
[2:00:04] since anybody had even come up and
[2:00:07] wanted to be saved.
[2:00:10] We're in that time and people don't want
[2:00:12] to be saved.
[2:00:13] The door of mercy is going to be closed
[2:00:15] before long. Can't you see?
[2:00:18] It's like it's already gradually closing
[2:00:20] little by little and people aren't even
[2:00:24] feeling the drawing power no more. They
[2:00:26] don't care. They just they don't want
[2:00:27] it.
[2:00:29] Oh children,
[2:00:32] we worship you today, Jesus.
[2:00:36] Father, you saw there was a few hands
[2:00:38] that was raised up, Lord. And
[2:00:41] I'm asking you here today, Father God,
[2:00:43] you know these individuals and what what
[2:00:47] their uplifted hand meant, Lord. Maybe
[2:00:51] they've never known you. Maybe they've
[2:00:52] known you and got away from you, Lord.
[2:00:54] Whatever it is,
[2:00:56] may they be able to sense the love of
[2:00:59] Jesus Christ
[2:01:01] in this place today.
[2:01:04] Whatever they've done and however
[2:01:06] they've lived, may they realize that you
[2:01:09] died for them to set them free.
[2:01:14] Oh Jesus,
[2:01:16] you knew all of our shortcomings,
[2:01:20] but you looked beyond all of our fault
[2:01:24] and you saw our needs.
[2:01:28] Help me, Lord, that I can love more like
[2:01:31] you.
[2:01:34] We bless you today, Jesus.
[2:01:38] We worship you, Lord. How many of
[2:01:40] Christians here today been serving God
[2:01:42] for years and years, but you say, "I
[2:01:44] want more of his love, Brother Tony.
[2:01:47] I want to be more like him." Me, too. I
[2:01:50] do with all my heart.
[2:01:54] Me, too. Amazing
[2:01:59] grace
[2:02:04] will always be
[2:02:08] my song of praise.
[2:02:11] [Music]

[2:02:15] was grace
[2:02:19] that ball
[2:02:21] my liberty.

[2:02:47] but he looked
[2:02:50] beyond
[2:02:53] all my fault.
[2:02:57] And so
[2:03:00] I need everybody together now.
[2:03:06] I shall forever
[2:03:13] lift
[2:03:14] my eyes

[2:04:10] lift your hands, close your eyes. I

[2:20:26] Praise the Lord.
[2:20:28] Thank God for a mom and daddy that love
[2:20:32] the Lord. This is one of the greatest
[2:20:34] days of their life. Be able to see their
[2:20:36] children come be able to take on the
[2:20:38] name of the Lord Jesus and water
[2:20:40] baptism. As our brother Cole comes
[2:20:43] today, of course, we want to pray for
[2:20:45] him as he begins this new stage of his
[2:20:47] journey that God would just be with him.
[2:20:49] As his pastor, I can baptize him in
[2:20:51] water, but only almighty God can fill
[2:20:54] every fiber of his being with the Holy
[2:20:55] Ghost.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And let's just pray for our
[2:20:57] brother today. Heavenly Father, as our
[2:21:00] brother comes to this stage, oh God, we
[2:21:02] are so grateful to see you still dealing
[2:21:04] with hearts and pulling on them. Lord,
[2:21:06] we are thankful. We pray for our brother
[2:21:08] that you'd just be with him, Lord, and
[2:21:10] strengthen him and help him. Lord, he
[2:21:12] said he' been you'd been dealing with
[2:21:13] his heart and we are so thankful for
[2:21:15] that, Lord. We just ask you that you'd
[2:21:17] take his life, Lord, and make it what
[2:21:19] you've ordained it to be. Fill every
[2:21:21] fiber of his being full, so full of the
[2:21:24] Holy Ghost, Lord. Help him to be a
[2:21:26] living example of the word of God. Take
[2:21:29] him Lord and use him for your kingdom.
[2:21:31] In Jesus name we pray. Amen. In
[2:21:35] obedience to your faith, my brother, I
[2:21:37] baptize you in the name of the Lord
[2:21:39] Jesus Christ.
