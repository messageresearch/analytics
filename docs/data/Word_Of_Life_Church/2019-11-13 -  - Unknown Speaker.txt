and the last bus it are they that do His commandments that they may have right to the Tree of Life and may enter in through the gates into the city and we'd like to be remembered today as we pray just bow our heads if we would and reverence to the Lord our gracious loving father we thank you today for the opportunity once again to stand in your presence for Jesus we ask father that you would help us first of all forgive us of our shortcomings our trespasses our failures our mistakes which I know are many but we thank you Lord that truth and righteousness mercy and peace have met and resolve has been brought between them Lord Jesus we ask today father that should take your word and speak to our hearts we've come to your table once again and as always we're hungry we're needy we're thirsty we love you Lord your grace and mercy and ways are hard for us to explain it's it's something that we never thirst for again once we get it but we never get enough so it's likely once we find it it's what we've been looking for all of our life but it makes us want so much more it's a mystery to us but we love you today and we just ask you that should help us on the service father speak to us your word we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Amen god bless you may be seated as you know I've got a very old direct life to the service today but we've got too many wonderful things to look at today to rush so if I get one third of it said that's fine one tenth one hundred that doesn't really matter what we want to do is follow the channel today of the Lord I don't like putting God on no timeframe deve certainly one of their hearts to be open to him today as we believe that we're a people that are privileged to live in the last day and the end time and know the wonderful things that God has done is doing and believing that the atmosphere that we are living in the world that we're living in is certainly under an influence of two supernatural world's the world's above us the world's beneath us as we've been reading it for a few weeks to draw a conclusion to help us to see why people do the way they do why they live the way they live it's not just by mortal choice we know that because man in the Garden of Eden of course was placed on that basis to be able to choose right from wrong and which way to go but yet there was greater influence and the Garden of Eden then what was visible to the natural eye that was the influence of The Tree of Life and the influence of another being which was there and we know that that influence is still ongoing today been looking at the tree of life and restored fruit that God desires to be on the broad tree in the last day and last week we looked at peace and what a great thing pease truly is is it not we know that peace has certainly been taken from the earth in the measure that God had it there's no way that you and I can comprehend today Eve and those of us that are filled with the Holy Ghost the amount of peace the quantity of peace and the quality of peace that existed in the earth before man ever fail what we know today even with the baptism of the Holy Ghost as wonderful as it is and what God has restored to us by that it would pale in comparison to what that peace must have been and the paradise of God and yet we know that he desires to restore us back to that place I believe that with all of my heart as we get closer and closer to the influence of heaven itself expressing itself upon the earth I believe God desires the fruit of his own life of his own nature to sow permeate us if he'll is influencing the people that on the earth and they are reflecting hell acting like hell talking like the attributes of hell then truly there must be an influence of people on the earth that are going to be able to reflect God's grace I believe that don't you and we know that the Prophet told us it will jump down the middle of this quote here you cannot be a spiritual being sinner or Saint without having an influence from the underworld or from the above world your influence from here if you're from above your celestial body is waiting up here if you're wicked hypocritical and indifferent your celestial body is down here regardless of how much you think it's up here because the fruit that you bear before people proves not just where you're going but where you're from so you are here what you are somewhere else your life that you live here is just a reflecting of what your inheritance is when you leave here we believe that with all of our hearts and we know that this is the reason the darkness is so pressing and the age and the hour we're living because hail according to the Old Testament prophet has opened up her gates and the influence of hail is so pressing out it's hard to believe that our world our nation is reeling under the impact of such darkness and yet no matter what we do we will never reverse it it'll never be reversed under Jesus comes and takes it over again we could put an Abraham Lincoln and have to be in mayor of every town we could put a George Washington to be the governor we could put all these great men that have been our forefathers at Thomas Jefferson to be able to be in in every little magistrate we would never reverse it because the cycle of darkness is moving and hailed as so emptying out it's as if though that God is allowing it to come to such a place you my know that it's been this way in previous times before before the and alluvium destruction there was such a violence that moved upon the earth and it's one of the signs of destruction that moved upon the earth in the days before Noah received a revelation from God that a flood was going to come and the Bible mentions the horrific sins that was there and one of the things that so stood out to the author of the book of Genesis was violence was upon the face of the earth and we can see that saying reoccurring again we see also under the administration of the Red Horse under the opening of the second seal that great power was given to the rider of the Red Horse that he would take peace from the inhabitants of the earth now we know that peace has not been here like it should have been since the very fall of man but yet through this we see that somehow the administration which the red of course was a symbolism of a color the horse or the symbolism of a power and the upon there was an administration by which all of that coming together that through that power was given war and the war one war after another after another and by that it pulled peace from the inhabitants of the earth so they came through a cycle on the earths that they were able to have peace and then war would come and then that have peace and war would come and we know that the merging together of these swine horse riders and the colours of the horses is consummating in the end time to wind up in the pale horse so we know that peace again is certainly being taken from the inhabitants of the earth but on the other hand the real peace of God I believe is being restored as part of the fruit to those that are under the influence of the Holy Ghost oh don't you appreciate the peace of God now we know that mercy and truth must have a place of reconciliation the justice of God must be met with the truth of God God cannot be able to require something of man and say that man must be able to answer for all of this that he's done wrong and then God turned the blind eyes it was but there must be a place of reconciliation to where that justice can be met notice this in Psalms 29 11 the Lord will give strength unto his people the Lord will bless his people with peace a man the Lord will give strength unto his people the Lord will bless his people I want you to notice the designation of divine peace is not given to all the inhabitants of the earth it's not promised even those who just go to church but it's promised to those who are his people so if you today are struggling with the lack of peace and your walk with God this is one of your scriptures you need to write down and be able to quote it over and over again until this promise of God is made manifest in your life all beloved ani you don't know all I'm going through you're right I don't know all you're going through but I know this promise is greater than all you are going through so God gives us his word and it's up to us to take that promise of the word and we water that promise every day was praised and we allow God to bring that promise to pass in our lives right let me read it again the Lord will give strengthen to his people and the Lord will bless his people with peace again Psalms 37 11 but the meek shall inherit the earth and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace they hear the psalmist David moves plumb over into the millennial reign of the son of David and he's able to capture by inspiration what's going to transpire when the Lord Jesus is ruling and reigning upon the earth and he said the meek shall inherit the earth and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace now remember David was a prophet he was a different profit than Jeremiah Seco zephaniah haggai and so on but yet he was a prophet and David was able to catch this in the future tense that the meek would actually inherit the earth and that they would delight themselves in the abundance so it wasn't that in the Millennium that there would be you know a rationing of peace and we have to be careful with how much peace that we have because God does not have enough to go around but there will be an abundance of peace well let me just give you a little bit of insight I believe there's an abundance right now if we can be able to move beyond the worries the fears the dreads of life and be able to break into the Avenue by which are abundant God has supplied it for us again Psalms 37 37 marked the perfect man and behold the upright for the end of that man is peace praise God the end of that man is peace notice again in Psalms 85 10 now again the Prophet David able to break into the inspiration and no doubt the man did not even have a clue brother John the ending of the fulfillment of what he was fixing to say because inspiration would come to these men they didn't always know why they didn't know why they were saying it this way they probably didn't even have the full comprehension I'm sure when this come out of the utterance of David's mouth or by the pen by which he was writing it that he must have unrolled it but the gene and looked at it and marveled to the great meaning of it and he says mercy and truths are met together righteousness and peace have kissed each other listen to this again mercy and truth are men together now watch as David sets forth about the Justice of God knowing that God was a just God and then what God sets forth the penalty of law disobedience and then God said that the penalty of disobedient to his wall is death then that can never be eradicated until the justice of God is met so here goes mercy and truth mercy heads in one direction truth heads in another and here they come and they meet in the way one of them seeking for the Inquisition of truth to punish those who have broken the Justice of God the other one is searching for a way by which this can the penalty can be met and offered to those who desire it a way to release them and somehow they meet in the way and when they meet in the way their differences supernaturally are reconciled and when they are met praise be to God when they are met in the way they meet in the way one searching for the Inquisition of sin they are doing that the other ones searching for reconciliation and David said mercy and truth are met together and licit the fruit of it righteousness and peace have kissed each other so righteousness is given to truth and peace is given to mercy and they were met in the way with opposite goals with opposite intentions yet they were met in one place where it was that way it was that way in Saint John when he said I am the way the truth and the life any man that will come to the Father must come by me in him was mercy and truth and righteousness and peace met in the way and reconciliation to what God has been resolved please mister God it was meant by the price of our lovely Lord Jesus rendering to us what the Inquisition has been solved and the resolve has been met mercy and grace have kissed each other and we are the progeny of that union Amazing Grace how sweet the sound notice Psalms 119 verse 165 great peace I love this great peace have they which love thy law and nothing shall offend them now freely we taste something I you know most of you have been saved for many many years for a long time as I have as well and one thing that I've noticed about a lot of folks you can really tell a lot about words they are you know some people they carried their feelings around on the shoulder and they don't like this in church and they don't like to add in this hurts them and this offends them and that hurts them and what I found out a lot of times through the years is that most of the time those folks that are so easily offended about everything it's not that there's so many offenses that are around but whether the reality of the problem is themselves they don't love the Lord right so they go to church with this and all I didn't like this and I didn't like that you know really that they're not even satisfied with life in reality they're just not satisfied with anything in life and folks that are troubled with within are always the troublemakers which reflect that trouble without people that have deep peace was in they are peacemakers and they reflect that peace was out so people that just profess peace by their mouths but are really troubled within their soul you watch everywhere they go no matter whether it's on the job whether it's in school whether it's in college whether it's in church whatever it is they leave a trail behind them of trouble because they are trouble we'll send them but you watch a person who has accepted the volume of the book the Word of God and they have transitioned by the grace of God into a sphere or a realm of peace you watch the trail of that individual and they will leave behind them one trial one mark after another after another of being a peacemaker because it's not in them to go around and cause conflict and trouble because our God is not the author of confusion but of peace notice David said great peace have they what's love thy law and nothing shall offend them now today if you really love the Lord Jesus right and you come here to church for five years and within that period of five years you're never able to shake my hand you're never able to be able to get some you know some close intimate time and me and my wife or say with the Deacons or whatever more and nobody ever brags on you nobody ever lifts you up and calls your name and says yes sweet and good and then all that sort of thing you are in that Bay yet God's revealed to you this is what you're supposed to go to church and you love him and you love his word you know what if nobody ever speaks to you from now on the rapture you have great peace because you love God's Word but if you're looking to be patted on the back and rubbed around and hanging like a little baby doll and we've got to give you a pacifier and a box of Pampers and that sort of thing well you're at the wrong place I'll tell you that right now and no matter how many papers we would give you and a box of pacifiers and suckers you'll never be at peace until you get that peace within yourself great peace they they love thy law and nothing shall athina look at the value I'm convinced friends that for many people they do not hold peace and high esteem and high value even whenever it comes to family arguments and family dissertations what's most important to a lot of people is that they get their point across and that you see their point and they will not shut up until you agree they are right you know why because that's what they esteem the most valued instead of peace and whatever you've argued and fussed and debated and you've proved your point what have you really accomplished because for the most part when you get done all they've done is agree to shut you up anyway and they still believe what they believe before you argued with them all they done is finally give in and you just they said you know they're sick of hearing your blabber mouth so they just arrived right right you're right you're right you're always right they don't believe that they don't believe that no you're the only one that believes that because you've just saved yourself but if we really valued peace we would understand that it's not just us proving our point and trying to get the other person to agree with our point but the value would be peace I love peace listen to this proverbs 16:7 what a man's ways please the Lord he make us he don't ask us he don't say is it okay us he make us his enemies you know why many of us have so many enemies and they're constantly honest it's our fault it's because our ways don't please God I notice God don't always make your enemies your friends that's not the scripture that's not the Marvel that God would actually make your enemies your friends but God will actually make your enemies to be at peace of where they just finally leave you alone oh well I guess I can close now notice it how many believe this is the Bible you believe it's the truth now maybe you're having a problem with someone or more than someone maybe two or three someone's or somebodies you need to apply the scripture to your life and make it one of your professions that God will take and make this word alive to you now would you believe it search was so done of course Solomon wrote this and he said when a man's ways please the Lord he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him why because the man is so desirous to please God now he's not trying to please his enemies you see that's where many people that misunderstand peace because they think that they have to compromise in order to be able to have peace no it's not pleasing the individual it's pleasing the Lord and then when you please the Lord the Lord will actually make earth as you see as always it's us trying to do it then we take it out of God's hands but if we will please the Lord the Lord will make our enemies to be a peaceful Jacob Omer Jacob was followed by his father-in-law by a truth of men was bad intentions he was met by his brother was another truth of men was bad intentions but when Jacob got to a place where he could surrender all to God both of them cunning what's a trunk one of him left him with a kiss and the other met him with one and comedy's I'm taking my daughters I'm taking these sheep I'm taking these goats and God said no you're not Jacob belongs to me [Applause] so your comes late and with bad and since I'm taking you to court I'm doing this I'm doing that on the other and God said are you really no I'll tell you what you're gonna do Jacob you are gonna leave humbly and you're gonna kiss him on the way out that he's so here's incoming Jacob's come and shake and comer and I saw said I'll tell you one thing I'll get that sorry brother am i lowdown sorry rascal God said really God said no I'll tell what you're gonna do mr. bigshot Esau you're gonna humble yourself and you're gonna kiss your brother [Applause] Laban leaves for the nose he saw leaves the tears both of them leave with peace on a man's ways please little but wonder why this didn't happen before now j-stop had not met God in the way of pineal that one Jacob comes to that spot maybe it's you Jeremiah chapter 29 verse 11 I know the thoughts but I think towards you say Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you and expected and what if God thinks thoughts of peace toward me well I don't want to have you so much peace cuz my thoughts imagine his you bet God want you to be tormented you bet God would just absolutely hate you and God wants you to barely make it and gonna survive that's nobody's thoughts let us jump to the New Testament it's what's the Lord Jesus how he sits is forth in such a strange peculiar way mark chapter 9 verse 50 salt is good but if the salt have lost his salt miss where will will you seize it have salt in yourselves wow what a recipe for peace so in order to have peace with one another we got to have saltiness now of course this would never work at the UN all the ambassador's to around and Iraq and you know ind in all the places of the world they would never take this on a you know on an emissary to be able to go and said now we are here to bring peace and here's a salt shaker well actually the only way we'll ever have peace among us is for us to become the salt shaker you see Jesus never said carry salt in a bag or go down and buy a box of Morton's iodized salt or get your box of kosher but jesus said in order to have peace among yourselves you've got to have salt I figured job would have that look on your face because that's a look I had when I read this scripture now look at this he says have salt in your cells look at the meaning of the word salt salt is a symbol of the lasting Concord because it protects food from future faction and preserves it unchanged accordingly in the solemn ratification of compacts the Orientals were and are to this day accustomed to perte of salt together so to make meat savory and to keep the flesh from spoiling [Applause] well we can stand dismissed y'all got it so in order to preserve the flash and to keep the flash and a suitable presentable manner praise be to God in this amazing now that the Lord Jesus actually says salt is good but if the salt has lost his saltness and what you notice any places this in the masculine form that the salt is him so for salt have lost his salt miss wherewith shall you recover it now you know if you've had salt very long that in time salt can actually go bad now that sermon kill my brother sister Larry that was there in Israel as well and we went down to the Dead Sea and of course it's salts everywhere the great content of salt that's in the sea itself but you could walk around on the banks and just see pieces of salt laying down there in the dirt but one thing that causes the salt to go bad specially than that area is the mixture of gypsum and other types of elements but this is why that they will purify the salt and get all the elements the long time and gossip I mean you know all these elements how because the salt in itself can keep for years years and years and times and ages and ages until you get all this other stuff mixed in with it and then when you mix all this other stuff in with the salt then you don't keep the flesh subject like it should and they all flash is a stinky old thing come on a heavy Valley the old France is rotten and the old folks don't like to be subject to the world so we got a poor salt in our hide sometimes so I need good hard preaching to Rebbe right good and that same creature that tires you from the top of your head to the bottom of your feet what's he do it'll pour honey in their moons he poor soul now what's amazing is when the Lord Jesus sets his force about this in mark chapter 9 he's actually dealing and referring to something that it happened in mark chapter 9 verses 34 up till that verses 47 and that was situations that existed among the Apostles himself never remember they are elect they are chosen but their unregenerate so they can only produce a certain element of the word of that day without the Holy Ghost so Jesus now is going to deal was part of their issues and part of their problems and said boys I'll tell you what you guys problem you only salt now this is why you've got these issues now let's let's look at these issues and Mark chapter 9 verse 33 what's one of the things that will prevent peace from being in families in churches among brothers it is self saltation and self-interests if y'all like I could finish his sermon me and there y'all that here once in mark chapter 9 verse 33 never remember this is just prior to the Lord Jesus saying about soul he came to Capernaum and they in the house he asked them what was it that you disputed among yourselves by the way but they held their peace I've been that way a few times myself I've seen you all be that same way when the Lord gets on you all than y'all hold your peace you don't say a man you don't say out you don't say nothing you just you're mummified come on they held their peace now notice why they held their peace for by the way they had disputed among themselves now because they lacked saltless within themselves they were focusing on who was gonna have the biggest ministry who's gonna be the biggest preacher who's gonna have the biggest Church who's the best singer did you notice they clap their hands for me more when I sung than they did when you son I've got to sing twice in the last six months and you've only got to sing once you like salt now this is Jesus cure for these types addition now this is why a lot of times that husbands and wives don't get along this is why a lot of times siblings don't get along now sibling rivalry goes plumb back to the Garden of Eden and we got time together than that that they do it but sibling rivalry is still alive and well today naturally and spiritually so here's the Lord Jesus is pointing back and say look boys your problem is lack of salt you sisters when you cook do you taste it soup pies puddings cakes whatever more Oh ain't got enough salt stir it up about see what you think what is that neat cayenne is it garlic is it onion powder it's missing something now look you have done that long enough to know it's not tasting exactly the same way it was in acts 2 I mean the last time that you made that recipe so you see that's what the Lord does see well sometimes when he kind of tastes of my life and said you're missing onion powder you're missing little bit of garlic you're missing a little bit of axe too a little bit of accent for your mixing a whole lot of action 30 a why because the original recipe produce God in human beings we want the same time do we not God in human beings on the face of the earth so God tastes of a love more brotherly love and he did that oh ma hmm hmm way too sweet too much sugar them folks I need some had skimming going on down there that pastor lay molasses on them all the time and honey well I need to send the vengers down there that'll burn them up from one side down the other God said there you go ice what's your name I know we don't like it we like honey preachers don't we oh that's our favorite kind oh ma you see another attribute that was missing in these boys was bigotry just in case you've forgotten what bigotry means I'm gonna read you the meaning of it obstinate or intolerant devotion to one's own opinions and prejudices I'll repeat it again for those of you who wrote it down and for those of you who don't want to dare rather their bigotry is abstinent or intolerant devotion to one's own opinions a good dose of salt takes care of bigotry but you have to keep it in there because you see the thing of it is were still left for a new creation left in this human temple and this human temple still has rottenness so it ain't like you get it cured one time and that's it note you gotta deal with it every day our friends don't time I had to preach an eight-member self to the small I'm gonna be war a matter of fact anything know what Mark chapter 9 verse 38 now look at all these preceding verses that lead to the salt Doctrine John answered him saying master we saw one casting out Devils in thine name and he follow us John the beloved John this is the way the beloved John was before the beloved John got the beloved Holy Ghost we saw one casting out Devils in thine name and he followeth not us notice John didn't say he wasn't following Jesus we said he wasn't following us and if he wasn't following us bless God we know he wouldn't right look at bigotry so obstinate about our views our opinion me mind helps take care of bigotry well praise God Shaun answer say Master we saw one casting out Devils in my name and he follow us not us and we forbad him we walked right up himself what are you doing you're him with us are you give you a fellowship card means you guys recognize this man who sent this guy what me Peter said what me said ender one means I'm mark well what in the world you actual do anything for the kingdom of God but the original salt shaker said forbid him not so the chosen disciples said one thing and the master of the disciple said something totally different why he was the salt [Applause] he was the salt forbid him not for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil of me boys don't you all see you've heard my teaching on marriage and divorce you've heard my teaching to the Pharisees and the Sadducees don't you see you all lack so much yourself you boys need a good salting now this brings two new light I hope the saying of being salty what's another thing that prohibits peace that's offensive mark chapter 9 verse 42 never remember this is the same chapter whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck this is a person now intentionally cast a stumbling-block or does something intentionally in front of someone to cause them to err oh my be better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the sea good reasons for salt can I go on farther I go the quieter y'all give what salt hurts noted no it hurts now Jesus is going to wind up in the ultimate purpose of the salt by bringing it down to personal failures in the lust of the flesh so from this point on nobody bat your eyes say man ouch Oh me or anything if you don't want to mark chapter 9 verse 45 and if thy foot offend they now you can reap several verses prior to this but to save time notice Jesus bringing the offenses now to the body to the flesh so if your eyes things you pluck it out if your hand offends you cut it off now the knowing is not physically speaking of removing the hand but he's pointing in a direction of the lust of the flesh then if there's something that repetitively bothers your flesh over and over again sever that weakness from yourself and listen friend the Holy Ghost will not do it if a smartphone gets you in trouble gets a dumb phone for a dummy if the internet gets you in trouble because you browse thro the browser and the internet out in the yard [Applause] [Music] [Applause] all my thoughtful offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter in halt into life than having

what are we talkin about application of salt well because of your eyes offending you by looking at things you should not look at guess what you just forfeited your peace with God come on now friends

that old tongue that wants to talk about our neighbor wants to hold a well someone so offended me I pop salt to the offense it'll cure it then what you have is when you apply the soul to the offense the outcome and the productivity of that is peace oh I don't go to their websites no more praise God I feel so much better when I get down on my knees to pray because there is now for now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus praise God why used to get so mad and I say brother so-and-so and sister so and so you know what I've done I open up battle wound and I laid a pound of

angels come here and brush your little wings and in Hellfire smell on you is it is that smoke on you come on be honest after a service you need help the artists like the rest of us what he needs salt apply to our lives what a peculiar recipe for peace she's got a problem with roaming eyes whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart pour salt in your eyes in the all ever say bad words and use kids I'll tell you one thing my my parents and grandparents back in Kentucky they had a real recipe for doing said step y'all know what lye soap is it was before Palmolive so when you said bad words and you said things you shouldn't have said that take you out to the wash bucket and then take out lye soap and put it in your mouth and wash your mouth out with soap now I realize that they throwed in jail today for child abuse I think they should be thrown in jail cause they don't whip up but raising a bunch of heathens we're raising a bunch of murderers because they don't have no discipline at home [Applause] oh my head and uncle my goodness he called his boys sneaking behind the barn smoking rap at the back he catch his boys saying things they shouldn't say he'd take a butcher knife he pulled her tongue out and scrape that tongue with that knife and pour what not any not molasses there are more colorful holders there next time they day they were real careful that one day there come on Saints we got our conversation we've got our thoughts we've got our confession so fail with the devil's language not a good Christian I'll never make it I'll never be in the right role you need to get that trash out of your mouth your confession needs to be [Applause] this is the kind of preaching that got better gene tarot rated for meeting the Lord kind of don't get you're now ready to it's on I offend thee pluck it out it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye nobody know they only know one eyed people in heaven but Jesus is showing us the value to imagine removing one of your eyes he said this is how important it is when you've got things in you that take away your peace or the space between you and God a peace between you and your brothers or you in your life notice in verse 48 where their worm dies not and the fire is not quenched and then Jesus says verse 49 which is one of the most debated verses in the entire Canon of Scripture theologians tried to this very day to even understand the concept of it for every one shall be salted with fire and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt then he says salt is good so when y'all leave church that I said how is church salt is good his talents at salt is good isn't what isn't a word do you mean by that what salt is good but if the salt has lost his saltness now maybe to this I found this in history a little bit to be able to show you the salt from the marshes and lagoons or from the rocks in the neighborhood of the Dead Sea Diesel he acquires a stale and alkaline taste because of the mixture of the world arming jimson it is literally good for but to be thrown away and trampled underfoot can you imagine the Lord Jesus now giving us this command of all the great things you say love one another and forgive and do this and then Jesus comes whether Joe and inserts this command have salt in yourselves this is not an option our peril endures on your car this is a command the same God that said love one another and pray for one another said have salt you see the salt is the power of God it's amazing what salt can do salt is so powerful that with the energy release out of its chemical makeup that you pour just unripe amount of salt on a piece of meat and me Buffalo whatever was before they had freezer packs and all that sort of thing how would our fathers our ancestors and grandmothers and so on keep their meats salt form on Sony and they didn't have a ziplock package they didn't have that compact but they kept them apart salt I was at our Apostolic fathers were kept they didn't want they were in vacuum rat Christian they wasn't cellophane Christians they were kept of salt they were rugged you ever take a bag of all hand meat it's got that salt in it you know what song can do a little bit of salt on a piece of flesh can actually transform that flesh and impart to that flash a power that takes on the very nature of the salt itself [Applause] imagine the ham set don't do that don't do that I don't like so I don't want something you say shut up and you rub it all over it and you write a fare and in no time the power in that salt has changed that flesh to taste like salt and the first said I don't want you I don't want to on the cell set it's too late now buddy I've done been applied to your life it's token time I don't want to go to church you're going anyhow I don't feel like praying I don't wash up anyhow some of us might ought to check our personal shakers and make sure you've got salt in yours and city sugar because we like to baby our flesh I'm too tired to worship you're pouring sugar on your flesh oh I'm too tired I don't feel anything brother Donny I don't have to feel anything to

feet every time I preach to you know I am anointed to preach I am anointed to worship I am anointed the same I am anointed to pray that has nothing to do with feeling tell me you were waiting on signal you need to wake up and realize I'm not gonna worship God because of feeling this house has purified characteristics and traits cleansing traits it will help purify you from selfish sins it helps do away it was self because salt contains this power of self-denial you love it Jesus says where else where you season it have salt and yourselves and have peace one with another oh it's amazing that salt can take this piece of meat that come off of the 500 pound Yorkshire Hulk and then there's other piece of meat come off of the 250 pound other count Hulk and then over here's another piece of meat that come off of a little skinny Hulk and all of them fall under the pile of that salt it transforms them all keeps them all and they all taste suck what's up well I don't do this and I don't

hug our necks and say thank you man of God thank you for telling me the truth [Applause] you can see why most folks will not have peace in this world you can save a lot of folks in church won't have it a lot of families won't have it it's not worth the sacrifice I should give up my idea in my opinion my my my my-my-my me me me me me let me just be honest for you I have a really hard time getting
