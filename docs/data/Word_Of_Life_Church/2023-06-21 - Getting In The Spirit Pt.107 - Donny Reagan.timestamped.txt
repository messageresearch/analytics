[33:11] two Sundays ago my wife was left church
[33:14] and she she's got a thyroid condition

[33:19] and she couldn't even hardly swallow
[33:20] there's like a knot or something in her
[33:22] throat
[33:23] and
[33:24] we prayed as a family
[33:27] and she had to go for a scan yesterday
[33:31] and they said
[33:33] nothing's changed and now she's able to
[33:35] eat better and she's able to swallow it
[33:37] better I just want to give thanks to the
[33:38] Lord

[52:04] that I wasn't going to start out perfect
[52:07] I wouldn't keep every step just exactly
[52:09] right he knew I'd mess up
[52:12] he knew you'd Miss up
[52:15] but he loved us in spout of all those
[52:17] things armor grateful for them
[52:20] God bless you let's turn tonight to
[52:21] First Corinthians chapter three if you
[52:23] would
[52:28] First Corinthians chapter 3.
[52:30] verse 11.
[52:32] we will um
[52:34] consult the master builder again tonight
[52:39] for other Foundation can no man lay then
[52:42] that is laid which is
[52:44] Jesus Christ
[52:46] now if any man build
[52:48] upon this Foundation what Foundation
[52:52] Jesus Christ
[52:54] so it's possible for a man to build on
[52:58] Jesus Christ
[53:00] gold
[53:01] silver
[53:03] precious stones
[53:05] wood
[53:06] hay
[53:08] stubble
[53:09] so a person can actually build that on
[53:12] Jesus lay that on Jesus Christ
[53:16] that's where a lot of organized religion
[53:18] is built on on the principles of what
[53:21] they call Christian Christianity which
[53:24] the Romans call christianos
[53:27] Every Man's work shall be made manifest
[53:31] for the day
[53:33] shall declare it because it shall be
[53:36] revealed by fire
[53:39] and the fire shall try every man's work
[53:43] of what sort
[53:45] it is so you can have different sorts of
[53:49] work built on Jesus Christ I show them
[53:53] want mine to be the right sword don't
[53:55] you
[53:56] if any man's work
[53:58] abide
[54:00] which he has built thereupon
[54:02] he shall receive a reward so notice
[54:06] rewards is joined together with works
[54:11] so you can work and work and work and
[54:14] work and get to the end of the way and
[54:16] the fire will try it and if it doesn't
[54:19] pass the fire test
[54:21] you lose it all
[54:23] every bit of it
[54:25] every bit you say God's not like men
[54:27] that he look I said well you know what
[54:28] you've done it you labored so long I
[54:31] just can't see that it's right for me to
[54:32] not reward you nope you lose it all
[54:36] but you yourself
[54:37] will be saved so as by fire
[54:40] if any man's work abide which he hath
[54:42] built there upon he shall receive a
[54:45] reward if any man's work shall be burned
[54:49] he shall suffer loss but he himself
[54:53] shall be saved
[54:55] yet so as by fire
[54:58] oh
[55:00] I made a lot to be remembered to that as
[55:02] we pray
[55:03] before we pray I've got a couple of
[55:05] requests that I'd like to make known to
[55:08] you
[55:09] sister Jill fleeman over in South
[55:12] Carolina we want to continue to remember
[55:14] our sisters had been battling with
[55:17] cancer for several years now I've
[55:19] already gone through a low spot right
[55:21] now so we'd like to remember her sister
[55:25] Joy Green had a pretty rough fall today
[55:29] at Walmart and heard her hurt her knees
[55:32] really bad back of her head she fell
[55:34] backwards hit the back of her head on
[55:37] the hard floor of concrete so they did
[55:40] X-rays and things like that but she's
[55:42] still not feeling very good so we'd
[55:45] appreciate if you'd remember her also
[55:48] Erica
[55:49] they still haven't found the cause of
[55:51] her fever but it has been doing better
[55:54] thankfully so if she's doing doing well
[55:57] through tonight hopefully she'll get to
[55:59] come home tomorrow so if you would
[56:01] remember that I mean he has to need
[56:03] requests on your heart
[56:07] heavenly father as we bow our heads

[56:13] we have been given this opportunity that
[56:16] we could come together tonight
[56:18] to be able to worship sing praise pray
[56:22] adore be corrected Lord just whatever
[56:25] you have in your mind for this service
[56:27] is exactly what we want
[56:30] so father we bring these needs that
[56:32] we've mentioned to you Lord and we're
[56:34] praying tonight for sister Jill fleeman
[56:37] father you see Lord she's been battling
[56:40] this thing for several years now and we
[56:42] pray that you would help our sister
[56:44] father would you strengthen her Lord God
[56:47] would you bring healing Deliverance
[56:49] would you bring encouragement
[56:52] which a helper to not father we pray
[56:54] you see our sister joy as she took this
[56:57] fall today and
[56:59] Lord God really hurt her knees and hit
[57:02] the back of her head and father we're
[57:04] praying in the name of Jesus May there
[57:07] be no evil that O Come of this Lord God
[57:10] would you reach down and touch our
[57:12] sister even now Lord
[57:14] father we also asking you for Erica
[57:17] tonight that you would just be with her
[57:18] Lord and help her I know she's wanting
[57:21] to come home so bad father we just pray
[57:23] that you'd be with her and work that out
[57:26] Lord hundreds of hands are uplifted in
[57:28] the visible audience and no doubt many
[57:30] many more that we can't even see with
[57:32] our natural eye so we're praying to be
[57:35] mindful of the needs of your children
[57:36] maybe some are physical some physical
[57:39] those that some in their minds some in
[57:42] their bodies some in their Spirit some
[57:44] Lord It's a mental battle some lord it's
[57:46] their family could be finances whatever
[57:48] it is Lord God we ask you together as
[57:51] your children that you would just move
[57:53] form Lord help me dear God that I can
[57:56] get out of the way tonight and you can
[57:58] speak through me Lord something that
[58:00] would be a benefit to your people
[58:01] granted father we pray tonight in the
[58:04] name of the Lord Jesus
[58:06] and the Saints said amen
[58:08] God bless you you may be seated
[58:14] I don't know if you know it or not but
[58:17] actually face
[58:20] and works
[58:22] our husband
[58:23] and wife
[58:25] so if a man says he has faith and does
[58:29] not ever do any works
[58:31] brother Benham likened that to a man
[58:34] saying that he is married
[58:36] but he cannot produce a wife
[58:39] so I said oh yeah I'm a married man I'm
[58:41] an absolute I'm a married man well
[58:43] where's your wife ah well I don't know
[58:45] that's the way it says it works is Faith
[58:47] Express in Shreveport 1965. I don't know
[58:51] I I don't know well he said if he cannot
[58:54] produce that wife then I am going to
[58:57] doubt that he's married
[58:59] so it works whenever we go to looking at
[59:02] works and we're identifying works and
[59:06] reward many times people get in their
[59:09] mind oh you're talking about works for
[59:11] salvation there are no works at all
[59:13] included in Salvation that's a separate
[59:17] thing we believe on what God has already
[59:20] done and the church said and we accept
[59:23] that and we are saved by accepting the
[59:27] finished work at Calvary so nothing we
[59:30] do will ever bring Merit by which we can
[59:33] be saved will never be good enough we'll
[59:35] never be able to pay him back he don't
[59:38] want repayment he does not want us to
[59:40] pay him back for what he saved us from
[59:43] but what he wants us to do after he
[59:46] saves us then is our life to be
[59:48] quickened by the spirit of God and then
[59:51] we go to producing out of that
[59:53] Sanctified Holy Ghost fail life Fruit
[59:57] which is equivalent to work
[1:00:00] so those works is what in turn you and I
[1:00:04] will stand upon the elevated position
[1:00:06] when we walk before him not the white
[1:00:09] Throne judgment but the elevated place
[1:00:12] that John described in the Book of
[1:00:13] Revelation and we will receive a reward
[1:00:17] accordingly now for those works it is
[1:00:21] those things which God enables us to do
[1:00:24] so God caused some to be preachers some
[1:00:27] to be singers some to be musicians some
[1:00:30] to be helps some to be governments Paul
[1:00:32] mentions that Corinthians each one of us
[1:00:34] have something that we can do and that's
[1:00:37] all that God requires of each of us I'm
[1:00:41] so glad God will never require of me
[1:00:43] what God's given you the ability to do
[1:00:45] and the same way with you God will never
[1:00:48] require you to do what this man can do
[1:00:51] or that person can do only what he
[1:00:54] equips and qualifies you to do is the
[1:00:58] only thing that you and I will answer 4.
[1:01:01] now when brother Branham preaches works
[1:01:03] his faith Express I love the way he does
[1:01:05] it because he contrasts what Paul said
[1:01:08] about works and Faith with what James
[1:01:11] said about works and faith and it would
[1:01:14] be a stumbling sort of situation if it
[1:01:17] was not for an understanding to be
[1:01:19] brought together because Paul sets it
[1:01:22] forth in one way and it seems as if
[1:01:25] though that James says it in an entire
[1:01:28] different way but what the prophet does
[1:01:30] he catches it and brings it together and
[1:01:33] says the way Paul said it for us was
[1:01:35] what God saw about Abraham and what
[1:01:39] James saw was what man saw about Abraham
[1:01:43] when both of them are talking about
[1:01:45] Abraham so it's the same with us so we
[1:01:49] want what God sees about us when it
[1:01:51] comes to works and we also want what
[1:01:54] people will see about us when it comes
[1:01:57] to worse so we're not trying to work a
[1:01:59] way to Heaven we're not trying to work
[1:02:02] so that we can have a big reward well
[1:02:04] brother Donnie in other words the more I
[1:02:06] do the more I get no you've still got
[1:02:09] the wrong idea we want to do it simply
[1:02:12] because he calls us to do it that's the
[1:02:15] reason that we do it so we're not doing
[1:02:17] it for any type of Glory we're not doing
[1:02:20] it so that we can be you know lifted up
[1:02:23] by people and people will look at us and
[1:02:25] say oh he's such a great singer and she
[1:02:28] is such a great person and she does this
[1:02:31] and this and this no we've still got the
[1:02:33] wrong thing in mind now it's a shame but
[1:02:36] it's always been that even those many
[1:02:38] times that are used by God will battle
[1:02:41] that very saying I get so amazed
[1:02:44] whenever I will listen and I saw it in
[1:02:47] Pentecost coming up and I hate to say it
[1:02:49] but you see the same thing in the
[1:02:51] message it's almost like that when a
[1:02:53] preacher will pray for somebody you
[1:02:55] really have to listen close in every
[1:02:57] testifiers about it to figure if he's
[1:02:59] trying to get Glory out of that answered
[1:03:01] prayer if he's given glory to God you
[1:03:04] kind of Wonder because it's almost like
[1:03:06] it was them that done it well I prayed
[1:03:08] for a lot of people I ain't never healed
[1:03:10] nobody yet and I guarantee you they no
[1:03:13] other preacher ever done it either so I
[1:03:15] figure anybody that's ever got healed
[1:03:17] whether I prayed for him or you or
[1:03:19] anybody else it was not us that done the
[1:03:22] healing so I don't figure that we need
[1:03:24] to try to show that Glory with God but
[1:03:27] we need to keep ourself in that humble
[1:03:29] spot and realize we are unworthy
[1:03:31] servants in the first place
[1:03:34] but this is a very great battle because
[1:03:36] man when they are being used by God they
[1:03:39] will venture for not careful they will
[1:03:42] venture into that forbidden territory
[1:03:44] which is called God's Divine Glory now
[1:03:48] notice this what James says in James
[1:03:49] chapter 2 verse 26 for as the body
[1:03:53] without the spirit is dead so faith
[1:03:56] without works is dead as the body
[1:04:00] without the spirit is dead so faith
[1:04:03] without works is dead also so if a
[1:04:06] person says they have faith that God is
[1:04:09] going to heal them well what they're
[1:04:10] going to do they're going to start
[1:04:12] acting like they're healed even though
[1:04:14] they may not be able to do anything but
[1:04:16] wiggle that one finger so they're going
[1:04:18] to wiggle it with all the wiggling power
[1:04:20] they can they're going to testify
[1:04:22] they're going to give praise they're
[1:04:24] going to do everything they can do and
[1:04:27] are they buying their healing no they
[1:04:29] are expressing their faith by worse now
[1:04:32] you notice well as I do that when you go
[1:04:35] to testifying of something that is
[1:04:37] unseen the devil will try his best to
[1:04:40] make you afraid and he will try to tell
[1:04:42] you you're going to bring an
[1:04:44] embarrassment upon God and you're going
[1:04:46] to bring an embarrassment upon your
[1:04:49] family because what if it don't work
[1:04:51] uh-huh and you're telling the doctors
[1:04:54] you're going to be healed and then the
[1:04:56] doctors is going to come back and see
[1:04:57] you in your casket and what are you
[1:05:00] going to do well if you're dead you're
[1:05:01] going to do nothing that's pretty
[1:05:02] evident is it so he will try to
[1:05:05] intimidate us to get us not to testify
[1:05:09] about the power of God so what you want
[1:05:11] us to do he wants us to wait until after
[1:05:14] every symptom is already gone well
[1:05:17] you're not doing it by faith sin you're
[1:05:19] doing it by knowledge well come on
[1:05:21] somebody say Amen but Satan wants to
[1:05:24] intimidate you how many knows he's done
[1:05:26] it in your life and you go to testifying
[1:05:28] you can also witness to this I'm sure
[1:05:31] but when you go to testifying he will
[1:05:33] make you pay you say oh praise God God
[1:05:36] heal my back and God done this and you
[1:05:39] get up in the morning and you can't even
[1:05:41] hardly move and you think Lord have
[1:05:43] mercy I don't think I'll testify no more
[1:05:46] until it's all done gone you ought to
[1:05:48] testify more than you did last night
[1:05:51] because it ain't nothing but the devil
[1:05:54] trying to back you off from the promise
[1:05:56] of God now that is works that we can do
[1:06:00] notice James again in chapter 3 verse
[1:06:03] 13. now listen at the way he turns this
[1:06:05] who is a wise man
[1:06:09] who is a wise man among you let him
[1:06:14] notices be let him the wise man that's
[1:06:18] going to be endued with knowledge among
[1:06:21] you what notice his words let him show
[1:06:24] out of a good conversation out of a good
[1:06:30] conversation now the the English
[1:06:32] language is very tricky and some words
[1:06:35] aren't really compatible to the Greek
[1:06:38] and the Arab man now you would take this
[1:06:40] word conversation as you would in other
[1:06:43] places that we're going to read from
[1:06:44] tonight and you would think that it
[1:06:47] would mean you're talking but you see
[1:06:49] that's where when the English wants to
[1:06:52] translate this from the original that
[1:06:54] they took a word that they thought meant
[1:06:57] talk but actually it don't say talk it
[1:07:00] says Behavior so notice then read it
[1:07:03] this way you as a wise man and endude
[1:07:06] with knowledge among you let him show
[1:07:10] out of a good behavior his works with
[1:07:15] meekness and wisdom one of the very few
[1:07:18] verses in the Bible that you will find
[1:07:20] knowledge and wisdom and meekness all
[1:07:24] together in the very same verse Now
[1:07:27] watch how that James now remember James
[1:07:29] is not a prophet like Paul and his
[1:07:31] Revelation wasn't near as great as
[1:07:34] Paul's was but I'll tell you James had
[1:07:36] some real understanding about knowledge
[1:07:39] and wisdom now many times we sing a
[1:07:43] person that quotes the Bible and quotes
[1:07:45] the message and quotes and has a lot of
[1:07:47] knowledge about facts and this and that
[1:07:50] and the other and if we're not careful
[1:07:52] we will say that person has a lot of
[1:07:55] wisdom but wisdom and knowledge are not
[1:07:58] the same thing at all wisdom will teach
[1:08:02] you how to use the knowledge that you
[1:08:06] have accumulated you see somebody it was
[1:08:09] a lot of knowledge and not very much
[1:08:12] wisdom can make a bigger mess out of a
[1:08:15] situation than somebody that's as dumb
[1:08:17] as a cold bucket they know they're dumb
[1:08:19] and they know they ain't got no answer
[1:08:21] so they just sat around well I don't
[1:08:23] know I really don't know what to say
[1:08:25] about it but somebody that's got a lot
[1:08:27] of knowledge and they'll spout out that
[1:08:29] knowledge and they'll say this and that
[1:08:31] and the other and if they're not careful
[1:08:33] they with their knowledge will take a
[1:08:35] situation that big and turn it into that
[1:08:37] big because they use knowledge and not
[1:08:41] wisdom now I know it's not a gift that
[1:08:42] we want very much I realize it's not
[1:08:45] even a gift among the message that many
[1:08:47] people seek after many people would
[1:08:49] rather have tongues interpretation
[1:08:51] prophecy Discerning of spirits well I
[1:08:54] don't want why don't want anybody want a
[1:08:56] word of knowledge why don't anybody want
[1:08:58] wisdom why don't we want none of that is
[1:09:00] that less than the vocal gifts is that
[1:09:03] something that we don't consider needed
[1:09:05] the lack of it proves Among Us that we
[1:09:08] need and yet Paul identifies that as one
[1:09:12] of the great things that God would give
[1:09:14] the church anybody here want that
[1:09:16] anybody want wisdom few of you
[1:09:18] you'd rather have tons you'd rather have
[1:09:20] prophecy you'd rather have healing
[1:09:22] Miracles oh but you see God James
[1:09:25] whenever inspired by the spirit of God
[1:09:27] who is a wise man and in dude with
[1:09:31] knowledge among you which is a strange
[1:09:32] concurrence that he would use both of
[1:09:35] these in the same now this is a real
[1:09:37] Gifted Man this is a real gifted person
[1:09:41] a person who is wise and has wisdom but
[1:09:46] also has great volumes of knowledge at
[1:09:49] the same time who is the wise man and
[1:09:51] endued with knowledge among you let him
[1:09:55] show out of a good conversation his
[1:09:59] works with meekness of wisdom now you
[1:10:03] notice that he does not say meekness of
[1:10:06] knowledge or if you can find somebody
[1:10:08] that's gotten meekness with knowledge
[1:10:10] you found a great thing because
[1:10:12] knowledge and meekness doesn't always go
[1:10:15] together notice how James couples this
[1:10:18] and makes it a union so what is it it's
[1:10:21] a coupling together of divine Natures of
[1:10:24] God which is imparted to the individuals
[1:10:27] that seek the deeper wisdom of God and
[1:10:29] the deeper understanding of God oh I
[1:10:32] know it won't be that many but it will
[1:10:33] be those that God can entrust and you
[1:10:36] know what Jesus never said that they
[1:10:38] will stand before me that day and have
[1:10:40] perfect wisdom perfect understanding
[1:10:43] perfect Revelation and he'll say to them
[1:10:45] depart from me I never knew you you'll
[1:10:47] never find Jesus ever saying that why if
[1:10:50] you have perfect wisdom perfect
[1:10:52] understanding perfect Revelation there's
[1:10:55] no way for you to be cast out of the
[1:10:57] economy of God because you are tied
[1:11:00] directly into the very Heart Of God
[1:11:03] himself but you can shout jump Run cast
[1:11:06] out Devils heal the sick raise the dead
[1:11:08] perform many mighty Miracles and shall
[1:11:10] be lost at the end of the way is that
[1:11:12] your Bible is that Matthew 24 sure now
[1:11:15] what so James says who is the wise man
[1:11:18] and endured with knowledge among you let
[1:11:21] him show out of a good conversation his
[1:11:25] works with meekness of wisdom with
[1:11:29] meekness of wisdom so true wisdom will
[1:11:34] not speak boastfully true wisdom does
[1:11:38] not acknowledge flesh true wisdom does
[1:11:42] not boast in the vanity of humanity well
[1:11:46] that was quite catchy wasn't it it will
[1:11:48] not boast and the vanity of humanity so
[1:11:52] true wisdom boasts in the greatness of
[1:11:55] God and the littleness and
[1:11:57] insignificance of man it will boast in
[1:12:01] the great things which are Eternal and
[1:12:04] the vanishing things that are here
[1:12:05] around us and it will acknowledge that
[1:12:07] we are all but as a puff of wind which
[1:12:10] is here for a while and gone and in a
[1:12:13] few years people will barely remember
[1:12:15] your name so that's how important you
[1:12:17] are congratulations
[1:12:18] but yet wisdom will acknowledge not only
[1:12:21] what we are here in this life but what
[1:12:24] we are going to it will focus on
[1:12:27] becoming what God wants us to be instead
[1:12:31] of focusing well I can be a big person I
[1:12:33] can do this I can move up in the
[1:12:35] corporation and I can amount to
[1:12:37] something important that's not wisdom at
[1:12:39] all because wisdom will let you know
[1:12:41] you're going to have a promise of a
[1:12:43] tomorrow none of us here tonight do even
[1:12:45] these young people sitting here there's
[1:12:47] not even a promise that they will be
[1:12:49] alive in the morning but notice the way
[1:12:52] that James does this true wisdom will
[1:12:55] not speak boastfully but wisdom now
[1:12:58] notice this meekness is not weakness
[1:13:02] meekness is not weakness actually
[1:13:05] meekness is greatness now this is why
[1:13:09] Satan and his kingdom cannot identify
[1:13:12] with such things as this you see the
[1:13:14] Lord Jesus could Condon sin to such a
[1:13:17] level that the devil could never even go
[1:13:19] there he could never go to the place the
[1:13:22] Lord Jesus could there's no way the
[1:13:24] devil would have ever stepped down from
[1:13:27] the throne in glory had he ever attained
[1:13:29] to that Throne he would have never got
[1:13:31] off that Throne he would have never
[1:13:33] Condes sinned to the Earth to come and
[1:13:36] get you get me no way it's not in him to
[1:13:40] be able to condescend he must always
[1:13:43] brag about himself he must always look
[1:13:46] up to himself and think he's just a
[1:13:49] little bit more than all the rest of the
[1:13:52] Angels well come on I wish somebody
[1:13:53] preach with me tonight
[1:13:55] whether Prophet Joseph said in question
[1:13:56] 59 that the devil wanted to be a little
[1:13:59] bit higher than his boss and he said God
[1:14:02] has a hard time finding a man that the
[1:14:05] more he uses it that the literary gift
[1:14:07] and he said if God can use us and the
[1:14:10] more that he uses this the littler we
[1:14:12] get and the smaller we get but for most
[1:14:15] humans the more God uses them the bigger
[1:14:18] they get in their own eyes in their own
[1:14:21] eyes but you see when we go to doing
[1:14:23] that we are actually working away from
[1:14:27] the Providence of God and it will
[1:14:29] actually stop the flow of the channel of
[1:14:31] God oh may God help us but you see
[1:14:34] meekness is not weakness yet it would be
[1:14:37] identified by many as that but actually
[1:14:39] what it is it is power under control so
[1:14:43] it is a word that was similar that they
[1:14:46] would use to bridling a horse so a horse
[1:14:49] would be you know 16 hands high and
[1:14:52] maybe have real a lot of strength to
[1:14:54] these muscles and all but you put that
[1:14:56] bit in his mouth and you can do a lot
[1:14:58] with that horse you can clamp down on
[1:15:01] that horse and here's the symbolism of
[1:15:03] the way that God was showing that if he
[1:15:06] can find a people a meat person does not
[1:15:09] selfishly assert himself he always knows
[1:15:13] there's a fine line he or she there is a
[1:15:16] fine line right there between the glory
[1:15:18] that God shares with any human being and
[1:15:22] that line which God Alone takes to
[1:15:24] himself you see this is why you'd find
[1:15:26] the prophet saying statements like this
[1:15:28] when he was talking about someone that
[1:15:30] wanted to debate with him and argue with
[1:15:32] him and he said I could have took that
[1:15:34] word I could have tied that man and it
[1:15:37] no sooner left his mouth and he come
[1:15:39] back and said uh the Holy Spirit could
[1:15:42] have took the word now you see there was
[1:15:44] something about what he said that
[1:15:47] exalted his own ability and he come
[1:15:51] right there and caught it and corrected
[1:15:54] himself I hope we got enough of the same
[1:15:56] Holy Ghost to say well I'll tell you one
[1:15:59] thing I could do this and I could do
[1:16:02] that well I'll tell you friends if we if
[1:16:03] we hang around folks that do that all
[1:16:05] the time and they can get by with it
[1:16:07] more than likely they need more of the
[1:16:09] Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost sent
[1:16:12] them if they say they've got it it's not
[1:16:14] the same holy ghost that was in the
[1:16:15] prophet because it corrected him and it
[1:16:18] lets you and I get by with it something
[1:16:21] wrong somewhere
[1:16:23] you see the me person does not selfishly
[1:16:27] assert himself as being over the word
[1:16:29] over the brothers because as a matter of
[1:16:31] fact the word tells us let us each one
[1:16:34] esteem our brothers higher than
[1:16:36] ourselves well now I'm talking about
[1:16:38] Rapture material you all do want to go
[1:16:40] right
[1:16:40] so the Greek word that was you Sarah was
[1:16:44] as I said a horse that had been broken
[1:16:47] so that his power was under control so
[1:16:52] the meek person seeks to exalt the honor
[1:16:55] and the praise and the glory of God not
[1:16:58] to cater it is flesh not to cater to the
[1:17:01] Flesh of other people but to bring honor
[1:17:03] to the glory of God now I used to have a
[1:17:06] horse many years ago I've had all kinds
[1:17:08] of them I've had while walking horses
[1:17:09] and and no thoroughbreds and quarter
[1:17:12] horses and this and that and the other
[1:17:13] and I had a horse and his name was Andel
[1:17:16] and that horse was a barrel horse I mean
[1:17:19] that's what that is barrel racing horse
[1:17:20] well it was a horse that they raced
[1:17:23] around barrels and it was used in a
[1:17:24] rodeo and that horse was so sensitive
[1:17:28] that all I had to do I never had to pull
[1:17:30] the rain this way or that way but he was
[1:17:33] broke where all he would do is feel that
[1:17:36] neck grain barely touching his neck like
[1:17:39] this and if I touched it like that he's
[1:17:42] going to Dart this way if I touched it
[1:17:44] like this I didn't have to jerk and jerk
[1:17:46] as a matter of fact it took me a few
[1:17:48] days to learn how to write it and I
[1:17:51] wound up on the ground a few times
[1:17:52] because I would barely touch his neck
[1:17:56] with that ring and whenever I would to
[1:17:58] him that was a signal for him to go that
[1:18:02] way that's the way he was taught he was
[1:18:04] running race professionally and that's
[1:18:06] the way he did it well it's easy to see
[1:18:08] he was professional and I was a redneck
[1:18:11] hillbilly I didn't know exactly what I
[1:18:14] was doing well come on you might as well
[1:18:15] say amen and that's the way we are
[1:18:17] sometimes with the things of God we
[1:18:19] think we're professional Christians and
[1:18:21] we think we're so great but when we wind
[1:18:23] up on the good dirt eating dust a few
[1:18:25] times when might as well go and
[1:18:26] acknowledge it you're a redneck
[1:18:28] Christian you might as well just say it
[1:18:30] well just get up wipe yourself off and
[1:18:32] get back on and we'll keep on riding but
[1:18:35] after a bit I found that horse was such
[1:18:38] a pleasure to ride I could take him and
[1:18:42] watch him get on his back and I could
[1:18:44] lay that Rain Sound the right hand side
[1:18:46] and just leaned it there he would go
[1:18:48] around and around and around well it
[1:18:50] didn't take but two or three times for
[1:18:51] me and that was enough because I would
[1:18:53] get sick but he would go around and
[1:18:55] around and around and spin on that hind
[1:18:58] foot and he would go around and around
[1:19:00] why that's what he was trying to do yep
[1:19:04] that horse could have killed me that
[1:19:06] horse could have thrown me off big tall
[1:19:08] stocky horse he could have thrown me off
[1:19:10] he could have trampled me to death but
[1:19:13] he was under control
[1:19:16] under control so a little field just a
[1:19:21] little nudge on his neck and as soon as
[1:19:24] I would take it from the right side to
[1:19:25] the left side he would change and go the
[1:19:28] other way whatever I told him to do he
[1:19:31] was oh my it's a pleasure to be able to
[1:19:33] ride well you're saying if an animal
[1:19:36] could do that what about a son or
[1:19:38] daughter of God that is so sense send it
[1:19:41] to the holy ghost that the Lord just
[1:19:43] barely Taps us as we would say and we'll
[1:19:46] just go this way and then the Lord's go
[1:19:48] go that way do this pray read your Bible
[1:19:51] forgive that brother don't you have a
[1:19:53] grudge now don't you hold a hard feeling
[1:19:55] my wouldn't we be some kind of
[1:19:57] Christians if we could be as good a
[1:19:59] Christian as Andale was a horse
[1:20:03] oh my you see my meekness is The Right
[1:20:07] Use of power now this is what meekness
[1:20:10] does and wisdom is The Right Use of
[1:20:13] knowledge meekness The Right Use of
[1:20:17] power and wisdom The Right Use of
[1:20:20] knowledge so this is why that knowledge
[1:20:22] by itself what does the Bible say Paul
[1:20:25] writing about it knowledge puff us up
[1:20:28] knowledge puff us out well you know what
[1:20:30] I'm talking about because I don't know
[1:20:32] you know you've been I'm sure like me
[1:20:34] you run into some people they know a
[1:20:36] little bit about everything and if you
[1:20:38] don't think they do ask them and for 45
[1:20:40] minutes later you'll find out they at
[1:20:42] least think they do and they cover this
[1:20:44] and they go to the moon and back and
[1:20:46] they come from Mars and they cover the
[1:20:48] surface of Jupiter and they go here and
[1:20:50] they go there and say whoa but they may
[1:20:52] have a whole lot of knowledge or at
[1:20:54] least think they do but they sure didn't
[1:20:56] have much wisdom especially since I was
[1:20:58] just asking what time it was
[1:21:01] so you see a person a lot of knowledge
[1:21:05] and they did totally totally avoid I
[1:21:08] just wanted to know if it's time for me
[1:21:09] to leave or not I want to jumping around
[1:21:12] the Rover I went down to the atmosphere
[1:21:14] pressure down to our thousand feet in
[1:21:17] the ocean I went over here and I went
[1:21:19] over there I simply wanted to know what
[1:21:21] time it was so did that impress me it
[1:21:25] did not so does that impress us if it
[1:21:28] does there's something wrong with us so
[1:21:30] meekness then we'll couple together with
[1:21:33] wisdom my what a powerful scripture then
[1:21:35] that James wrote notice again in First
[1:21:37] Peter chapter 2 verse 12. watch Peter
[1:21:40] now he uses the exact same word having
[1:21:43] your conversation honest among the
[1:21:46] Gentiles now let's read this word in the
[1:21:48] Greek and it is this manner of Life
[1:21:52] conduct and behavior very same word now
[1:21:55] that James uses so it's not just your
[1:21:58] talk just not your conversation and your
[1:22:01] language ability and your metaphors and
[1:22:04] all that that you know how to say but it
[1:22:07] is your manner of life I notice sure
[1:22:10] Peter is actually addressing the
[1:22:12] Believers and he said how did your
[1:22:14] conversation on us among the Gentiles
[1:22:16] that whereas they speak against you as
[1:22:21] evildoers they may be by your good works
[1:22:25] now notice not by the doctrines that you
[1:22:28] believe not but how much you're able to
[1:22:30] quote the Bible quote the prophet but
[1:22:32] they by your good works oh my notice
[1:22:36] which they shall be whole glorified God
[1:22:40] in the day of visitation
[1:22:44] so you mean people then seeing our good
[1:22:47] works now he's not talking about people
[1:22:49] that actually even like you but he said
[1:22:51] these people were speaking against the
[1:22:53] Believers but he said if you will live
[1:22:56] right and you'll have the right kind of
[1:22:58] works that them good works he said which
[1:23:00] they shall be whole and glorified God in
[1:23:04] the day of visitation which is one of
[1:23:06] the oddest words I've ever seen in my
[1:23:08] life in the Greek language used for this
[1:23:11] word that he used and it was Bishop
[1:23:14] prick visitation so it was the office of
[1:23:18] a Preacher I thought how peculiar us
[1:23:21] look in sitting in the hospital room
[1:23:22] today and sitting there steady look at
[1:23:25] this I thought my goodness that is that
[1:23:27] is profound why in the world would Peter
[1:23:29] use such a thing and he identified the
[1:23:32] day of the visitation of God with the
[1:23:34] identification of a god-called office
[1:23:36] that makes it pretty tough for those who
[1:23:38] don't believe in Preachers don't know
[1:23:40] notice he said that they may behold and
[1:23:44] glorify God in the day of visitation how
[1:23:47] many Christian me tonight the good works
[1:23:49] are absolutely imperative for a child of
[1:23:51] God what about you young people you
[1:23:53] think it's necessary for you or is this
[1:23:55] 45 and above is this 55 and above no
[1:23:59] it's absolute requirement for all of us
[1:24:01] now watch this in the unpardonable sin
[1:24:03] the prophet said let us hold fast our
[1:24:06] profession of faith without wavering he
[1:24:08] is faithful to his promise let us
[1:24:10] consider one another to provoke one
[1:24:13] another and to love and the good worse
[1:24:15] now remember this is the scripture we
[1:24:16] looked at last week and Hebrews 10 24
[1:24:18] and this is the way then that brother
[1:24:21] Branham deals with that he said provoke
[1:24:23] their means to encourage so encourage
[1:24:27] one another unto love and to good works
[1:24:31] if you see a brother in the church now
[1:24:34] he's going to give an example of a good
[1:24:35] word if you see a brother in the church
[1:24:37] that's got something against the other
[1:24:39] brother don't say something to stir
[1:24:43] that thing up
[1:24:47] now we got a lot of stern Christians
[1:24:51] I said we got a lot of stern Christians
[1:24:54] in Christianity they like to stir up
[1:24:56] things
[1:24:58] uh-huh well I figure him you know amens
[1:25:01] is going to be scarce tonight but that's
[1:25:02] all right but you know you have a direct
[1:25:05] quote from your message telling you not
[1:25:08] to do such a thing
[1:25:10] notice what he says oh my don't say
[1:25:12] something to stir that thing up but say
[1:25:15] something that will bring them together
[1:25:18] so instead of trying to get in the
[1:25:21] middle of something and make it worse or
[1:25:23] to repeat well he said this about you
[1:25:25] and she said that about you I just
[1:25:27] thought as your best friend that you
[1:25:29] should know now this is just between me
[1:25:32] and you if you believe that oh my
[1:25:35] goodness well I I ain't told nobody but
[1:25:38] I'm going to tell you this uh-huh notice
[1:25:41] provoke one another under good works and
[1:25:44] to love is what we
[1:25:48] what
[1:25:50] now do you believe this is a must
[1:25:53] or you to believe that this wealth it's
[1:25:55] not really that important
[1:25:59] I personally believe
[1:26:01] this is a must
[1:26:04] praise the Lord me and one two three
[1:26:07] four five six seven eight nine ten
[1:26:08] eleven twelve
[1:26:10] anybody else 13 14 15 16. okay okay 17
[1:26:14] 18 19 20. well the case did not want to
[1:26:17] be left out of that mess did he
[1:26:21] noticing this is what we must do what is
[1:26:25] that
[1:26:26] oh my goodness
[1:26:29] oh
[1:26:31] that's a man
[1:26:34] that's born again
[1:26:38] that's a man
[1:26:41] that's born again
[1:26:45] notice it because honestly now we're
[1:26:46] very happy to know that the Lord Jesus
[1:26:48] still lives and Reigns and loves his
[1:26:50] people
[1:26:51] and has a peculiar people
[1:26:54] a people zealous
[1:26:57] of good works and not jealous
[1:27:01] not jealous
[1:27:03] but zealous in other words they're
[1:27:07] zealots
[1:27:08] anybody familiar with the term Zealot
[1:27:10] you know what a zealot was anybody okay
[1:27:13] well in the days of the Lord Jesus on up
[1:27:15] to the time of the Masada and on Earth
[1:27:18] for a long time there there was a group
[1:27:19] of Jews and they rebelled against Roman
[1:27:23] Reign and they call them zealots because
[1:27:26] they had such a Zeal to break the Roman
[1:27:30] Hole uh the the thing that Messiah many
[1:27:34] of you may know the guy's name and he
[1:27:36] was a seller and many of them men that
[1:27:38] died there on Masada they were zealots
[1:27:41] so they were hated by the Romans because
[1:27:43] they could not stand Roman rule and yet
[1:27:46] this is what God wanted his people to be
[1:27:50] zealous not to be like they were but
[1:27:53] zealous of Good Works to have such a
[1:27:56] passion such a desire to do good works
[1:28:01] well for what reason brother Donnie
[1:28:03] because God wants us to do them so where
[1:28:06] do we get that Zeal we get it from our
[1:28:10] father not that we can be noticed not
[1:28:12] that people are going to say well I just
[1:28:14] have to tell you so and so done this for
[1:28:16] me and that for me and that's what we
[1:28:18] wait to hear about no we want to do it
[1:28:20] in such a way and hope nobody else even
[1:28:23] finds it out we just want to do it and
[1:28:26] say praise the Lord Brother I'd rather
[1:28:27] that you didn't even tell nobody that I
[1:28:29] did that you know just just sits between
[1:28:31] me and you and just God bless you and I
[1:28:34] love you and let it go with that well
[1:28:36] praise the Lord a people that are
[1:28:38] zealous of good works I found this
[1:28:41] amazing again I was sitting in the
[1:28:43] hospital today and setting a little bit
[1:28:46] on this and I want you to notice what
[1:28:48] the prophet said here and let your light
[1:28:50] shine we're Christ billboard
[1:28:54] and Christ
[1:28:56] is our sponsor how many knows what the
[1:28:59] billboard is you drive out on the
[1:29:01] interstate on the road and you're going
[1:29:03] down through there and you're going down
[1:29:05] Interstate 65 24 uh whatever it is and
[1:29:09] there's a great big McDonald's sign
[1:29:12] don't run on empty and there's a Big Mac
[1:29:15] and them gold and fries
[1:29:18] now they got a thousand calories in this
[1:29:21] and you know how many over 100 calories
[1:29:23] of that and a Diet Coke on the side oh
[1:29:26] my gotta balance out everything don't
[1:29:27] you and don't run on engine now what
[1:29:30] does that do that's by your eyes
[1:29:32] watching that billboard then it sends a
[1:29:35] subliminal message and you might not
[1:29:38] have even been that hungry but all of a
[1:29:41] sudden you find your car in autopilot
[1:29:43] and it's just turning off to the right
[1:29:45] and you find what am I doing what am I
[1:29:47] doing I pull right into McDonald's I
[1:29:49] don't even like McDonald's but what am I
[1:29:52] doing now that is the power of a
[1:29:55] billboard and yet here brother random
[1:29:57] identifies us as being Christ which is
[1:30:01] Christ possessive Christ billboard and
[1:30:04] he is our sponsor so instead of it being
[1:30:08] McDonald's or a hotel chain or some type
[1:30:11] of gas station Christ is our sponsor so
[1:30:15] it takes our life and puts us on for all
[1:30:19] display and of course Christ is updated
[1:30:22] so we're not just using paper no more
[1:30:24] but we're the digital Billboards now so
[1:30:28] we are totally digital so we can change
[1:30:31] from the morning to the evening we'll
[1:30:33] put on the goodness of God and then at
[1:30:35] noon he'll reprogram us and we'll put on
[1:30:38] patience and we'll put on Mercy and just
[1:30:40] as it's needed we're just walking around
[1:30:42] and the spirit of God just digitized us
[1:30:45] to the presence of the Lord somebody
[1:30:48] needs a smile somebody needs a door open
[1:30:50] for them and you say oh my goodness oh
[1:30:53] thank you sir thank you are you so where
[1:30:56] are you from you know where are you from
[1:30:58] heaven heaven you know they know you're
[1:31:00] really strange whenever you say thank
[1:31:02] you and have a nice day you know I'm
[1:31:04] talking about we're living in that kind
[1:31:06] of crazy world the doctor came in to see
[1:31:08] Erica today and she was talking to her
[1:31:10] and tell her she said the support group
[1:31:12] that you have talking about her family
[1:31:14] and so on she said you are so fortunate
[1:31:16] so blessed she said yes ma'am I am she
[1:31:18] she said 75 of the people that I see and
[1:31:23] this is one of the main doctors in
[1:31:24] Franklin Woods she said 75 percent of
[1:31:27] the people that I see don't have hardly
[1:31:29] any help or any support from family or
[1:31:32] friends nobody she said well I wish I
[1:31:35] could adopt some of them people out to
[1:31:37] people that would just come in and sit
[1:31:40] with them and be nice I thought what a
[1:31:43] cruel age we're living in that people
[1:31:46] don't even love their own families they
[1:31:49] don't even won't even go visit them and
[1:31:51] see them whenever they're sick and in
[1:31:53] the hospital and we say we are
[1:31:55] Christians
[1:31:57] well preach brother Donnie
[1:31:59] what kind of billboard are we
[1:32:02] advertising who are we advertising for
[1:32:05] Jesus said when you've done this to the
[1:32:08] least of these my brethren you have done
[1:32:11] it unto me you see friends it is not
[1:32:14] just something we ought to do to our
[1:32:16] family it's something we ought to do to
[1:32:18] the family of God
[1:32:20] notice the way it says that then we're
[1:32:22] Christ billboard and Christ there's our
[1:32:24] sponsor and this sponsorship is by
[1:32:27] Christ and he is giving us our life to
[1:32:32] sponsor him so now watch Once you become
[1:32:34] his billboard and that is his property
[1:32:37] that is his property so it's not a part
[1:32:40] of the outdoor living which is one of
[1:32:41] the main ones here in the South who owns
[1:32:43] many of the Billboards so they're the
[1:32:45] ones that you have to go to and Lease so
[1:32:47] they on the lease they on the rights if
[1:32:49] you want to put a sign of whatever more
[1:32:51] you have to contact them I'd like a sign
[1:32:53] on Interstate 40. I'd like one on here
[1:32:56] and there and there well it'll cost you
[1:32:57] so much so much all right I'll do it so
[1:33:00] you're the one that's sponsoring and
[1:33:01] what does that billboard do it puts out
[1:33:04] your message your message loves exit
[1:33:09] number 36 we have now RV hip hookups
[1:33:12] we've got fresh watermelon we've got
[1:33:14] cantaloupe
[1:33:16] boy oh my we want the hell what does
[1:33:19] that do if a billboard can do that to
[1:33:22] your mind and my mind what about a holy
[1:33:25] ghost filled Christian billboard that
[1:33:27] will give the world a smile that will
[1:33:30] let somebody know there is a God in
[1:33:32] heaven and he's not a dead Creed he's
[1:33:35] not a dead Church he's not a dead is it
[1:33:38] but he's a living resurrected savior
[1:33:42] a billboard
[1:33:45] oh my goodness notice this he goes on to
[1:33:47] say a simple clean
[1:33:50] billboard
[1:33:52] was Christ wrote
[1:33:54] across your life
[1:33:57] then men will see now notice what
[1:33:59] they're going to see they're going to
[1:34:01] see your good works and glorify the
[1:34:06] Father which is in heaven not you
[1:34:09] not you
[1:34:10] they're going to say oh so-and-so and so
[1:34:12] oh my goodness oh my goodness you know
[1:34:14] if we're not so careful friends we're
[1:34:16] going to get so tied up in the flesh of
[1:34:18] this person that person remember when
[1:34:20] you go to trusting in the arm of the
[1:34:22] flesh the prophet son told us God will
[1:34:25] cause that man to make a mistake in
[1:34:27] front of you
[1:34:28] to prove to you he is a man I don't care
[1:34:32] who it is don't you ever put your
[1:34:36] ultimate confidence in nomad
[1:34:38] you put your ultimate confidence in
[1:34:41] Jesus Christ all men are flawed you
[1:34:44] better do it absolutely I'm Flawless
[1:34:47] just like every other man you know and
[1:34:49] every preacher you know oh brother Tim
[1:34:51] Pruitt ain't flawed yes he is I know him
[1:34:54] not brother Donnie don't you go to Sam
[1:34:57] by the wrong Spencer is brother Ron
[1:34:59] you're probably listening to me tonight
[1:35:01] I'm seeing right now smiling that
[1:35:03] million dollar smile looking over sister
[1:35:04] Connie brother Ryan Betty I love you but
[1:35:08] you're flawed brother Andrew you're
[1:35:11] flogged brother down your flower and all
[1:35:14] the rest of you all in here and flow too
[1:35:16] that's why we go so well together we're
[1:35:20] all flawed there ain't nobody that we
[1:35:23] can look up to and make an idol out of
[1:35:28] oh my goodness
[1:35:30] oh Jesus
[1:35:32] boy it's bad when you go to preaching on
[1:35:34] sheep it's really dangerous and you go
[1:35:35] to preaching on preachers you're taking
[1:35:37] your own life in your own hands ain't
[1:35:39] you wow notice this then men will see
[1:35:42] your good works
[1:35:45] but it kind of makes you wonder if men
[1:35:47] are glorifying men
[1:35:50] what what what causes that because
[1:35:51] according to the the right way is that
[1:35:54] when they see your good works they won't
[1:35:57] glorify you that I should glorify the
[1:35:59] father
[1:36:01] so it makes you wonder about some of the
[1:36:03] works and some of the things that's
[1:36:04] happening is it not pointing to this man
[1:36:07] or that man or another man
[1:36:09] uh-huh well I'm preaching amen I've done
[1:36:12] it before it just takes twice as long
[1:36:14] though y'all think Shores the world I
[1:36:16] got a button in my mouth instead of a
[1:36:18] lifesaver
[1:36:19] now notice oh my then men will see your
[1:36:22] good works and glorify the Father which
[1:36:26] is in heaven that's it don't be smutted
[1:36:29] up
[1:36:30] with the trash
[1:36:32] of this world
[1:36:36] so every person here tonight that
[1:36:38] professes to be a Christian
[1:36:40] you are a billboard
[1:36:42] you're a billboard at work
[1:36:44] you're a billboard a church
[1:36:47] you're a billboard when you're over in
[1:36:49] the fellowship hall
[1:36:51] and when you've got the basketball
[1:36:55] aha come on now brother Donnie preach on
[1:36:58] that
[1:36:58] you're a billboard when you've got the
[1:37:00] volleyball you're a billboard when
[1:37:03] you're picking people to be on your side
[1:37:05] or not on your side
[1:37:07] you're a billboard every one of us are
[1:37:09] we all are Billboards so what are we
[1:37:12] projecting Christ or ourselves Christ
[1:37:16] what's most important to us well I'll
[1:37:18] tell you one thing I ain't no way in the
[1:37:20] world I'm going to get so and so on our
[1:37:21] side because they can't even play
[1:37:24] so in other words what's more important
[1:37:26] to you is winning than hurting
[1:37:27] somebody's feelings
[1:37:31] [Applause]
[1:37:40] brother Jackie what's this air set on
[1:37:42] buddy
[1:37:44] listen this I just heard it kick on
[1:37:46] thank you Jesus no wonder the world does
[1:37:49] not appeal to us
[1:37:51] we are A peculiar people
[1:37:55] sell us unto good works we have been
[1:37:58] recreated in him
[1:38:01] oh my to be children
[1:38:04] like unto our father
[1:38:07] I wonder friends
[1:38:10] whenever we look at that and we measure
[1:38:12] us
[1:38:14] as being a billboard
[1:38:16] what do people feel when they're around
[1:38:18] us
[1:38:19] do people feel comfortable being around
[1:38:22] us
[1:38:23] or if you're worse a little more
[1:38:25] money-wise do they not feel they belong
[1:38:29] to your class
[1:38:30] in the church
[1:38:34] well if they've got more than one class
[1:38:36] here
[1:38:38] you ain't following the teaching of your
[1:38:39] pastor
[1:38:41] I don't care if you make 500 a year or a
[1:38:44] half a million
[1:38:45] you ain't no better off than the person
[1:38:47] who draws food stamps and lives off of
[1:38:50] Social Security
[1:38:52] got just as much right to God got just
[1:38:55] as much right to me as your pastor
[1:39:01] oh my notice this in the thightown
[1:39:04] churches now works will never take the
[1:39:06] place of faith in God for our salvation
[1:39:09] but works will show Force our face
[1:39:13] already placed in him good works won't
[1:39:17] save you but they will
[1:39:21] come forth out of a saved life
[1:39:27] as fruit
[1:39:30] works
[1:39:31] are fruit
[1:39:34] so Works will come out of a saved life
[1:39:38] it's the fruit
[1:39:41] that you're a Christian
[1:39:43] Matthew 7 16 you shall know them by
[1:39:47] their doctrines
[1:39:49] now how many sick they pray for how long
[1:39:52] the prayer line is you shall know them
[1:39:55] by their
[1:39:57] fruits two men gathered Grapes of thorns
[1:40:01] or figs of thistles now notice again it
[1:40:04] goes on then the same culture and the
[1:40:06] church age book if you are a Christian
[1:40:08] you're going to do what is right and
[1:40:11] your Works will show that your heart is
[1:40:14] right you see for those who do not make
[1:40:17] the connection of good works with a
[1:40:20] right heart then they believed their
[1:40:22] heart can be right with God and they can
[1:40:25] live like like the devil
[1:40:27] we have Christians people in this day
[1:40:30] that claim they are Christians and yet
[1:40:34] they smoke marijuana
[1:40:36] we are people who claim Christianity and
[1:40:40] curse
[1:40:42] look at Ron DeSantis running for
[1:40:44] president out of Florida of Christian oh
[1:40:47] yes absolutely identifies himself as a
[1:40:50] conservative you ever hear much of that
[1:40:51] man talking he cusses like a sailor
[1:40:56] oh I'm sorry I deflated some of you all
[1:41:00] look at what's called conservative look
[1:41:03] at Anheuser-Busch with what they've done
[1:41:06] and how much money they've lost I was
[1:41:08] just saying I just I just cannot believe
[1:41:10] not so much them but how many so-called
[1:41:13] conservative Christians are boycotting
[1:41:17] Bud Light
[1:41:20] gotta be kidding me I would have never
[1:41:24] thought a Christian would have even
[1:41:25] wanted anything to do with but light or
[1:41:28] Bud heavy or Bud anything else
[1:41:33] I've been hearing some of this and you
[1:41:35] say you've got to be kidding me so this
[1:41:38] is now conservative Christianity
[1:41:41] this is conservative Christianity that
[1:41:45] you're going to boycott Bud Light so
[1:41:47] yeah you're going to drink another beer
[1:41:49] and get drunk and say roaring of God
[1:41:54] and that's conservative can't you see
[1:41:56] friend well the world is going heading
[1:42:00] straight for tribulation
[1:42:02] oh you say we're the same as they are we
[1:42:05] are not we are called out from that
[1:42:09] trash and nonsense of the world oh
[1:42:11] Hallelujah God said come out of her my
[1:42:14] people and be you a holy separate people
[1:42:17] saith the Lord
[1:42:27] oh wow
[1:42:31] if you are a Christian you're going to
[1:42:34] do what is right your Works will show
[1:42:38] that your heart is right and it won't be
[1:42:42] something you put on for you will do his
[1:42:45] will I love this part when no one
[1:42:51] but God
[1:42:53] sees you
[1:42:58] praise the Lord
[1:43:00] that means when you're alone with your
[1:43:02] cell phone
[1:43:04] I preach mother Donnie well your Holy
[1:43:07] Ghost shouldn't be your wife your Holy
[1:43:09] Ghost shouldn't be your young ones come
[1:43:11] in and then you change websites come on
[1:43:14] but you know God's there David said I
[1:43:17] keep him always before me that's why
[1:43:20] people do wrong because somehow they
[1:43:22] think God ain't there at that moment
[1:43:24] when they're setting wherever they are
[1:43:26] and they go somewhere on some website
[1:43:28] that ain't fit for a home to look at and
[1:43:31] they're sitting there looking at it come
[1:43:33] on Prairie children and yet they don't
[1:43:36] cannot how can they believe that
[1:43:37] almighty God is right there in that room
[1:43:39] watching everything they're doing if you
[1:43:42] do you'll walk a different walk you'll
[1:43:45] talk a different talk you'll live right
[1:43:48] you'll walk right you'll stay cry and
[1:43:51] when the Rapture gets ready to take
[1:43:52] place you'll take your flightless what
[1:43:55] is right
[1:43:57] hey
[1:44:00] oh my you will do his will when no one
[1:44:03] but God sees you listen to this
[1:44:06] and you will do his will even if it
[1:44:10] costs you
[1:44:12] your life
[1:44:20] praise the Lord can it go on thank you
[1:44:26] let's look at eternal life for a few
[1:44:27] minutes how many at least you have it
[1:44:30] eternal life already
[1:44:34] listen to this a person who lives
[1:44:38] their life for their self
[1:44:41] lives a selfish life
[1:44:45] we must live for others
[1:44:50] bear you one another's burdens and so
[1:44:52] fulfill the law of Christ and we've got
[1:44:54] to have a feeling
[1:44:56] for one another
[1:44:58] and therefore when you've done all you
[1:45:00] know how to do them when you do lay down
[1:45:02] at night well you have the consolation
[1:45:05] knowing that you tried
[1:45:07] your best
[1:45:09] I want you to notice the words that he
[1:45:12] chooses here
[1:45:13] a person who lives their life
[1:45:17] for their self so they live their life
[1:45:21] for themselves they live a selfish life
[1:45:24] but burying one another's burdens so
[1:45:26] what is the law that is breaking into
[1:45:29] the law of God the law of Christ
[1:45:31] so we must not just do things for others
[1:45:36] but actually live
[1:45:39] for others
[1:45:40] now think about it process it not just
[1:45:43] do good things on the occasion
[1:45:46] that actually living
[1:45:48] for others
[1:45:52] notice again he says so each day I want
[1:45:56] to live life not for myself
[1:45:59] if I live for myself I live
[1:46:03] a selfish life
[1:46:06] I want to live for others and give what
[1:46:08] strength I have not to myself and to my
[1:46:12] own pleasure
[1:46:16] testing one two testing
[1:46:19] y'all hear me
[1:46:25] yeah wow
[1:46:27] I want to live for others and give what
[1:46:30] strength I have not to myself
[1:46:34] unto my own pleasure
[1:46:37] but for the benefit of others
[1:46:40] that'll build the kingdom of God
[1:46:46] now don't raise your hand
[1:46:48] but how many of you are honestly
[1:46:50] do this
[1:46:52] daily
[1:46:54] weekly
[1:46:56] monthly
[1:46:58] yearly
[1:47:00] on leap year
[1:47:07] you say friends this separates bride
[1:47:11] from church
[1:47:16] it's amazing how much we do for us with
[1:47:20] us in mind
[1:47:23] and about how much of us we think about
[1:47:27] and how much we say about us
[1:47:32] I find it amazing
[1:47:34] you know
[1:47:35] you can I'm on several ministers chats
[1:47:39] and if a certain brother from a certain
[1:47:41] Church
[1:47:42] well say I want to share a miracle that
[1:47:45] the Lord did the Lord did such and such
[1:47:48] and so and so on our church on Sunday
[1:47:51] some of the brothers come on Earth
[1:47:52] praise the Lord that's wonderful
[1:47:55] but if that same thing happens at their
[1:47:57] Church
[1:47:58] they go on and on and on and on
[1:48:06] about how great it was and the very same
[1:48:08] thing happened at another man's church
[1:48:11] and they say praise the Lord
[1:48:15] I personally have a problem with that
[1:48:17] you know why
[1:48:19] because they're not given the right
[1:48:20] glory to God
[1:48:22] it's greater if it's in their Ministry
[1:48:25] and their church and their Pastor let me
[1:48:28] ask you something how can it be any
[1:48:30] greater where a dead person is raised
[1:48:32] from the dead here or raised from the
[1:48:34] dead in Guatemala are raising the dead
[1:48:37] and brother Doug Baker's church in
[1:48:39] Tucson which happened there as well
[1:48:41] should not we give the same glory to God
[1:48:44] since he's the only one who can raise
[1:48:47] the Dead
[1:48:51] I just don't understand what is it
[1:48:54] selfishness
[1:48:56] selfishness it's always greater when
[1:49:00] it's at my church it's greater because
[1:49:03] my pastor prayed the prayer face
[1:49:09] I honestly don't care which one of you
[1:49:12] praise the prayer
[1:49:14] if one of your brothers prays the prayer
[1:49:16] faith for Eric and she's healed one of
[1:49:19] your sisters one of you mothers I
[1:49:21] couldn't care less it don't have to be
[1:49:24] my prayer it don't have to be the wife
[1:49:26] my wife's prayer I don't care if one of
[1:49:28] you is able to touch God for sister Joy
[1:49:31] Green tonight for sister Jill flaming I
[1:49:33] don't have to say well glory to God I
[1:49:36] went down on my knees and I went before
[1:49:38] the Lord and I'll call Sister Jill
[1:49:40] fleeman's name and glory to God wouldn't
[1:49:42] you know it the Lord heard my prayer as
[1:49:45] always and he always comes on the scene
[1:49:48] for me you big bag of wind
[1:49:51] [Applause]
[1:49:55] you can't heal cancer man can't raise
[1:49:59] the dead only Jesus Christ can heal
[1:50:03] cancer only Jesus Christ concept the
[1:50:07] captive free so we need to give all the
[1:50:10] glory and all the praise not to a
[1:50:13] preacher not to a church but to Jesus
[1:50:17] Christ
[1:50:27] You're Gonna Keep On sir you're gonna
[1:50:29] get me fired
[1:50:32] now there's some more brother random
[1:50:34] goes with this and that day on Calvary
[1:50:37] Jesus never lived
[1:50:39] for himself
[1:50:42] his life was spent for others
[1:50:44] that's perfectly
[1:50:48] eternal life
[1:50:51] if you mothers and fathers husbands and
[1:50:53] wives would start living more like this
[1:50:57] a lot of the arguments in your homes a
[1:50:59] lot of the divisions would totally
[1:51:02] dissolve
[1:51:04] a lot of problems in your family other
[1:51:07] problems in our church a lot of the
[1:51:09] problems in the churches around the
[1:51:10] world would totally dissolve
[1:51:13] because we quit well not me and my my
[1:51:16] kid my child my this side the other my
[1:51:19] my that's the problem
[1:51:21] my my my Me Mine All Me
[1:51:32] when you say you go to church and you do
[1:51:34] good things that's fine
[1:51:36] but when you live
[1:51:38] your life
[1:51:41] to yourself
[1:51:44] you haven't
[1:51:47] eternal life
[1:51:50] I'm sorry friends
[1:51:51] I just have an issue with folks that
[1:51:53] don't believe you need to go to church
[1:51:55] you know why they cannot fulfill that
[1:51:58] quote
[1:51:59] they lived their life to their self you
[1:52:00] know why because it's hard having
[1:52:02] friendships
[1:52:04] let's just face facts sometimes it'd be
[1:52:06] easier if each one of us had our own
[1:52:08] private planet
[1:52:12] especially when you get tired of people
[1:52:14] you just say I'm buzzing off to wherever
[1:52:17] it is where you go I'm telling you
[1:52:19] I don't want you showing up in my Buzz
[1:52:22] Light here get away from me you ain't
[1:52:24] tracking mine in Carol's spaceship we're
[1:52:26] out of here
[1:52:27] we're gone it'd be much easier why
[1:52:30] friendships require work
[1:52:33] friendships can be difficult and people
[1:52:36] say oh it ain't worth it know if you're
[1:52:38] a stubborn Hellbound goat it ain't that
[1:52:41] if you're a sheep that wants to fulfill
[1:52:44] God's word and you know I've got a
[1:52:47] responsibility to go to the house of God
[1:52:50] I've got to look out for my brothers
[1:52:53] I've got to look out for my sister and
[1:52:56] they need to look out after me I need
[1:52:59] them and they need me
[1:53:02] foreign
[1:53:12] looking forward to the special meeting
[1:53:14] since you all
[1:53:19] and let me tell you one thing that's
[1:53:21] going to make them so special
[1:53:23] preaching like this that leads us up to
[1:53:26] it
[1:53:27] don't you get in your mind Tim Pruitt
[1:53:29] Ron Spencer or David Siler is bringing a
[1:53:31] special anointing with them that they're
[1:53:33] bringing a special sermon all of a
[1:53:35] sudden that's going to turn our church
[1:53:36] upside down if there ain't nothing for
[1:53:39] them to preach to if there are any
[1:53:40] people that believe the word and if
[1:53:43] there ain't a people that are taught the
[1:53:44] word of God it won't do them a whole lot
[1:53:46] of good to come but if we can hide the
[1:53:49] people that'll say Amen a people that'll
[1:53:52] say preach it brother tend to hide off
[1:53:55] of me cause I want to do right we're
[1:53:58] going to have a meeting that's going to
[1:53:59] be absolutely awesome absolutely
[1:54:03] overwhelming because God knows we need
[1:54:06] it
[1:54:14] let me close to this when you say you go
[1:54:16] to church and you do good things that's
[1:54:18] fine
[1:54:18] but when you live your life
[1:54:21] to
[1:54:23] yourself
[1:54:25] you haven't
[1:54:27] eternal life
[1:54:32] eternal life
[1:54:33] is living
[1:54:35] for others
[1:54:39] it proved it when he come and the Lamb
[1:54:41] of God he lived and had eternal life
[1:54:43] because he did not live for himself
[1:54:45] he lived for others
[1:54:47] you receive
[1:54:49] eternal life by receiving that day
[1:54:53] and you don't live for yourself
[1:54:56] no more
[1:55:00] no more
[1:55:05] you live for others
[1:55:08] someone said how can you stand and let
[1:55:10] anyone call you such bad names
[1:55:13] you don't live for yourself
[1:55:16] now what a strange thing how what a
[1:55:19] scenario to put that in so how can you
[1:55:20] let people call you such bad names and
[1:55:23] this is his answer you don't live for
[1:55:25] yourself
[1:55:26] so then what do you do when people call
[1:55:28] you badge names and then you go back on
[1:55:30] Facebook and call them names you're
[1:55:32] living for yourself
[1:55:38] thank you
[1:55:43] you don't live for yourself
[1:55:45] you live for others
[1:55:47] that you might redeem
[1:55:51] that man
[1:55:57] that you might redeem
[1:56:00] that bad you become sons in the trouble
[1:56:02] but if the churches for God they were
[1:56:03] sons who aren't Sons you take in
[1:56:06] Christ's place you are Sons so you don't
[1:56:09] live for yourself
[1:56:11] I can live for this brother because he's
[1:56:14] sure a nice man that's not it
[1:56:17] listen children
[1:56:19] live for that man who hates you
[1:56:27] live for that person who'd kill you
[1:56:32] if they could
[1:56:38] oh my goodness Lord help us
[1:56:41] Lord help us
[1:56:44] that's what they've done to him they
[1:56:46] killed him and he died that he might
[1:56:48] save them
[1:56:49] facts
[1:56:51] eternal life
[1:56:53] when you when that's in your bosom
[1:56:58] you are facing heaven
[1:57:02] then
[1:57:05] not cleansing the leper raising the dead
[1:57:07] shouting running jumping no
[1:57:10] don't jump no harm you live if you live
[1:57:12] high jump to the roof brother we'll
[1:57:14] catch you when you come down
[1:57:18] but how do you treat others
[1:57:20] do you live
[1:57:22] for others
[1:57:24] home
[1:57:26] listen
[1:57:29] that's eternal life and that's in your
[1:57:31] bosom you're facing heaven then
[1:57:34] do you sacrifice your own things you
[1:57:36] give him up like the sheep gives up its
[1:57:38] wool
[1:57:39] you look on towards Calvary
[1:57:41] notice this as he goes on and he prays
[1:57:44] god
[1:57:45] let me be crucified today
[1:57:49] let me crucify today myself
[1:57:53] and my ideas
[1:57:56] that I might live with Christ and live
[1:57:58] for others
[1:57:59] no matter what they do to me
[1:58:03] if they make fun of me and persecute me
[1:58:06] and say all evil against men things let
[1:58:10] me just humbly walk along Meek like a
[1:58:13] lamb
[1:58:14] like
[1:58:15] he did
[1:58:18] oh my
[1:58:21] God I'm gonna be honest before we pray
[1:58:23] Lord
[1:58:25] I want to be like that
[1:58:28] I want to be like that
[1:58:30] our knowledge
[1:58:32] our gifts our healings our miracles our
[1:58:36] years have been around the message
[1:58:38] what good but even if that do us if we
[1:58:40] cannot do this
[1:58:42] this my brother sister is
[1:58:46] eternal life
[1:58:48] it cannot be impersonated
[1:58:50] a person can say I've received eternal
[1:58:53] life I went to those I received eternal
[1:58:54] life but look at the life they live look
[1:58:58] at the billboard
[1:58:59] that's on display
[1:59:02] so when people will do something against
[1:59:04] them or say something do they get even
[1:59:06] do they hold grudges it's amazing how
[1:59:09] many Christians hope grudges
[1:59:13] just hold grudges
[1:59:16] oh my goodness
[1:59:19] but when you stand praying forgive
[1:59:23] that your father may also forgive
[1:59:26] your trespasses
[1:59:29] oh my goodness I mean lots of memories
[1:59:32] we pray
[1:59:34] I may Believe by the grace of God you
[1:59:35] have eternal life
[1:59:37] how many once had eternal life to live
[1:59:39] more effectively out of your life
[1:59:42] that you are not your own self you don't
[1:59:45] sponsor yourself so you are not the
[1:59:50] message on your billboard it would make
[1:59:53] no sense for McDonald's to pay thousands
[1:59:56] and thousands of dollars for a billboard
[1:59:58] and then tell the person outdoor Life
[2:00:01] Resource you go and put on what you have
[2:00:03] whatever you want to I mean that's what
[2:00:04] I do when I go through a drowser
[2:00:07] what do you want just give me what you
[2:00:08] wanted I went to McDonald's the other
[2:00:10] day Believe It or Not Us in big rush I
[2:00:11] thought this is the closest thing I'm
[2:00:13] going to the hospital I'm gonna grab me
[2:00:14] something I want some McDonald's order a
[2:00:15] quarter pound of cheese no onion I got a
[2:00:18] fish sandwich
[2:00:25] so what I'm saying that's my philosophy
[2:00:27] I should have just said Jimmy whatever
[2:00:29] you want you're going to anyway
[2:00:31] but the Lord don't say that about us
[2:00:34] he says I bought you you are mine your
[2:00:38] message is not yours
[2:00:41] what you think I'm not interested in I
[2:00:44] never paid for you so you could project
[2:00:46] what you think I never paid for you so
[2:00:50] you could project your opinion and your
[2:00:52] ideas and blow your own horn I paid for
[2:00:56] you so you could project me
[2:01:01] oh my God
[2:01:06] dear Jesus
[2:01:09] gonna be another lonely Thursday
[2:01:13] it's about it
[2:01:18] Dear God
[2:01:23] Lord I pray that you'd help each of us
[2:01:25] tonight
[2:01:27] if a man woman
[2:01:30] boy and girl
[2:01:33] Lord if we say we have eternal life
[2:01:38] and yet we live our lives for ourselves
[2:01:42] it's all about us our opinion our ideas
[2:01:47] Lord God help us to see clearly tonight
[2:01:51] father we know
[2:01:52] self deceit
[2:01:54] is one of the hardest that there is to
[2:01:58] see Ever
[2:02:00] we can see others and we can see the
[2:02:02] devil oh yeah
[2:02:03] but how we deceive ourselves it can be
[2:02:07] so difficult
[2:02:09] we can see other people's faults so
[2:02:12] easily
[2:02:13] but looking at our own
[2:02:16] Lord God
[2:02:19] may we look tonight through your Vision
[2:02:22] or father
[2:02:23] and see eternal life itself
[2:02:27] must Express
[2:02:28] itself not us
[2:02:31] you didn't buy me
[2:02:34] so I would preach myself
[2:02:37] as Paul said we preach not ourselves
[2:02:42] you didn't come preaching yourself Lord
[2:02:44] Jesus
[2:02:46] you did just how I go around heal though
[2:02:48] I want to heal and I do this now another
[2:02:50] you said I do only what my father shows
[2:02:54] me
[2:02:55] you were the spirit's billboard
[2:02:59] you did that to be an example I just
[2:03:01] read it yesterday where the Prophet said
[2:03:03] you could have had wife
[2:03:05] you could have had a home
[2:03:07] could have had a family
[2:03:10] but you said I sanctify myself for their
[2:03:12] sake
[2:03:14] no doubt some of these people standing
[2:03:16] here tonight in Word of Life Church
[2:03:18] would have really struggled
[2:03:21] with you being sinless
[2:03:25] and being their redeemer
[2:03:27] if they would have known you'd had a
[2:03:29] wife
[2:03:30] you could have physically fathered
[2:03:32] children
[2:03:33] and they would have not been the literal
[2:03:36] children of God
[2:03:39] but it would have stumbled
[2:03:41] some of your people
[2:03:44] and they would have thought how could he
[2:03:45] be sinless how could he be holy and have
[2:03:49] a wife
[2:03:50] how could he had a home how
[2:03:53] so he said father
[2:03:55] I sanctify myself for their sake
[2:03:59] Lord Jesus I can't imagine
[2:04:03] how you would have loved to had a little
[2:04:05] wife
[2:04:07] when you got done with that great Sermon
[2:04:09] on the Mount
[2:04:10] how you loved had a little wife and you
[2:04:13] took her by the hand and had a little
[2:04:15] home somewhere Capernaum or somewhere
[2:04:18] you and her would have left them them
[2:04:20] old brawny fishermen Peter and James and
[2:04:23] John and left them arguing and debating
[2:04:25] and you and her just went back and maybe
[2:04:28] got out on a little boat
[2:04:29] just sailed across the Sea of Galilee
[2:04:32] and should have took him by the hand and
[2:04:34] held your hand
[2:04:36] said I'm here with with you I'm here for
[2:04:38] you
[2:04:40] no doubt you thought about it
[2:04:43] well let me just tell you right now sir
[2:04:46] I wasn't there then
[2:04:49] but I'm here now
[2:04:51] and I'm part of your life
[2:04:53] and I'm here to tell you
[2:04:56] you're my hero

[2:05:00] Everlasting father

[2:05:10] eternity
[2:05:12] for one day we will be resurrected and
[2:05:15] changed and stand before you and finally
[2:05:19] you will get your wife
