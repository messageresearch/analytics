[43:09] serving the Lord's been afraid
[43:11] yeah me too
[43:13] I'm afraid right now
[43:15] every time I get up to preach I get
[43:17] afraid
[43:19] a slice-facing every day of life
[43:23] and now we're living we just never know
[43:24] what a day will hold do we
[43:27] we never know what the world is going to
[43:29] do and everyone will know what people
[43:31] are going to do
[43:33] of all the things that we face in this
[43:35] day I'm so grateful that we have a
[43:37] stability in the Lord to be able to help
[43:40] us
[43:42] Psalms 37
[43:44] verse 3 Brother Louis already announced
[43:46] it but there'll be a youth service
[43:48] Florida tomorrow brother Rob asked me to
[43:51] speak at that service so
[43:53] from 40 and under and maybe even some of
[43:56] you that's eight or nine but Jack you
[43:57] kind of feel young the more you can come
[44:01] young at heart
[44:05] Psalms 37 3.
[44:09] trust in the Lord and do good
[44:11] so shall thou dwell in the land
[44:15] and verily Thou shalt be fed
[44:19] this is the scripture I know I've quoted
[44:20] it to you a lot in the last 36 years
[44:24] Delight thyself also in the Lord
[44:28] and he shall give thee
[44:30] the desires
[44:33] of thine heart
[44:35] that is a broad
[44:37] spectrum of a scripture
[44:40] listen to it carefully again Delight
[44:43] thyself also in the Lord
[44:46] and he shall give thee
[44:49] the desires
[44:51] of thine heart
[44:53] how can God do that
[44:57] how can God make such a broad statement
[45:01] that he will give you the desires of
[45:03] your heart all but you see that's not
[45:05] the first part the first part is Delight
[45:09] thyself
[45:10] also in the Lord
[45:13] so your Delight will regulate your
[45:18] request
[45:20] so a real child of God who serves the
[45:22] Lord with all of their heart
[45:24] they're not disposed to ask of anything
[45:27] knowingly that would be against father's
[45:30] will
[45:32] so that's why he could make such a bold
[45:34] statement that if you delight yourself
[45:36] in the Lord there's no way you willingly
[45:39] are going to ask for anything that you
[45:42] know would displease him
[45:45] so this is why God can put it in this
[45:48] way and this is why that he will grant
[45:50] it to you
[45:51] notice in verse 5. commit thy way unto
[45:55] the Lord and trust also in him
[45:59] and he
[46:00] shall bring it to pass what
[46:04] your desires
[46:08] hmm
[46:09] you can see why he can't give this to
[46:11] everybody
[46:12] only those who Delight in him and Those
[46:15] who commit notice the word he used our
[46:18] commit thy way unto the Lord so your
[46:21] desire is toward him your very happiness
[46:24] is built on pleasing him
[46:27] oh you want to try to get along with
[46:28] everybody as much as you can but
[46:30] ultimately
[46:31] God is first if you have to cross a mama
[46:33] your Crosser if you have to cross daddy
[46:36] or whoever it is you cross them because
[46:38] God is the one you want to please first
[46:41] commit thy way unto the Lord trust also
[46:44] in him and he shall bring it to pass
[46:50] Matthew 18 19.
[46:55] again I say unto you
[46:57] that if any two of you
[46:59] shall agree on Earth as touching
[47:08] anything
[47:10] that they shall ask
[47:12] it shall be done for them of my father
[47:16] which is in heaven
[47:18] for where two or three are gathered
[47:21] together in my name are we here today
[47:23] for that reason that purpose
[47:26] there am I
[47:30] so I hope you come today with that in
[47:32] mind
[47:33] this is not usual this is not church as
[47:36] usual this is while I'm going to church
[47:38] today Jesus is here
[47:42] so whatever you got need of
[47:45] he's here this is his promise that's not
[47:47] me it's not you it's on anyone else here
[47:48] that made that for where two or three
[47:50] are gathered together in my name
[47:54] there am I
[47:56] in the midst of them
[47:59] I mean he's got a request today on your
[48:01] hard desire petition let's just take it
[48:04] before the Lord
[48:06] Lord Jesus we counted such an honor to
[48:09] be gathered together again today
[48:11] in your presence in your house we thank
[48:14] you Father for each one that has put
[48:17] forth the effort to come today and we're
[48:19] just believing that you'll honor their
[48:22] efforts their sacrifices of coming to
[48:25] the house of God
[48:26] we pray father not only for the visible
[48:29] audience but for those that are
[48:30] invisible those who would love to be
[48:32] here today and sick and can't come those
[48:35] Lord that are streaming in different
[48:38] parts of the earth we pray that you'll
[48:40] be mindful of them today Lord and and
[48:43] their needs and Lord as we have come
[48:45] here we have many many needs in our
[48:48] homes and our lives our bodies our
[48:50] church we bring them before you Lord we
[48:54] never knowingly would ask anything
[48:57] contrary to your will we want your will
[49:01] above all things though sometimes your
[49:04] will is opposite of our will
[49:07] but we really want your will because our
[49:10] will is what's got us in so much trouble
[49:12] so we pray you would make your word real
[49:15] to us today that we can walk out of this
[49:18] place with a new understanding about
[49:21] what you desire for us
[49:23] in Jesus name we pray
[49:25] amen God bless you you may be seated how
[49:29] many believes these scriptures are true
[49:32] now turn with into Mark chapter 11 verse
[49:35] 23
[49:37] and then I'm going to ask you again
[49:39] how many beliefs this scripture is true
[49:42] this one is one of the most profound
[49:44] scriptures to me in the New Testament as
[49:47] far as the way that the Lord Jesus put
[49:50] it and it was one that actually stumbled
[49:54] the prophet himself
[49:55] now not stumble to unbelief but stumble
[49:59] to understand to try to comprehend what
[50:04] the Lord Jesus was saying notice this
[50:07] Mark 11 23 for verily I say unto you
[50:11] that whosoever shall say unto this
[50:16] mountain now I want you to get to the
[50:18] setting before we go to the next part of
[50:21] this verse the Lord Jesus is down in the
[50:24] Kidron Valley now for those of you who
[50:27] have been in Jerusalem you know
[50:29] Jerusalem is built upon a hill and then
[50:32] there's a valley that comes down like
[50:33] this on the Eastern Gate which is where
[50:36] they believe the Messiah will come into
[50:38] there's a gigantic graveyard so you go
[50:42] out the Eastern Gate you come down
[50:43] through here here's the graveyard go
[50:45] down through the Kidron Valley and then
[50:47] you'll come over to absalom's tomb you
[50:50] go down to the Church of all Nations
[50:52] which is where the garden is supposedly
[50:54] The Garden of Gethsemane was at so
[50:57] here's the city comes down like this
[50:59] down through our Broad Valley and then
[51:01] you start ascending on the other side
[51:03] now there's another Mount here of Mount
[51:06] scopus and also called the Mount of
[51:09] Olives and the Mount of Ascension is
[51:11] called several different names now the
[51:14] Lord Jesus is standing there on the
[51:16] proximity of the city
[51:19] so he tells them now if you will believe
[51:21] in your heart now the reason this
[51:24] question has been raised is because he
[51:26] had come through just a day or so prior
[51:29] to this and it cursed a fig tree and he
[51:32] looked at the fig tree and it didn't
[51:34] have no fruit on it so the Lord Jesus
[51:36] cursed that fig tree now what's amazing
[51:39] is it was not actually even time for the
[51:44] fruit to be on the tree but he wasn't
[51:46] doing this out of season remember
[51:49] prophets work in symbols so he cursed
[51:52] this fig tree because the Fig Tree was a
[51:56] type of Israel so he curses this tree
[52:00] and he says Lord no fruit hence Forever
[52:04] Grill on you well they turn right back
[52:06] around and they come through within
[52:08] another day or so and whenever they do
[52:11] they look at the Fig Tree and the
[52:13] disciples are just they're just
[52:15] overwhelmed they said Lord look at the
[52:19] tree look look at what happened to the
[52:22] tree now no doubt they didn't understand
[52:24] it it was more than just that tree but
[52:28] it was Israel's future because Israel
[52:32] was like the Fig Tree so he had come to
[52:35] them and they had produced the fruit now
[52:39] the Fig comes forth in several different
[52:40] stages so by this stage the Fig Tree had
[52:44] sent forth the precursor of the fruit
[52:47] but yet the fruit there was none there
[52:49] even in the pre-fruit states so he saw
[52:54] that the tree was not going to put forth
[52:57] what it should do and it was the same
[52:59] with Israel as a nation they should have
[53:02] recognized him they should have known
[53:04] who he was they should have believed him
[53:07] but they didn't so what did he do he
[53:10] cursed them now then from verse this
[53:13] verse prior to this then Jesus turns and
[53:16] then he says that that apostles were
[53:18] just surprised mesmerized by what had
[53:21] happened and then we go in to what Jesus
[53:24] said you're in Mark 11 23 for verily I
[53:26] say unto you that whosoever shall say to
[53:29] this mountain
[53:30] so he turns from the Fig Tree which
[53:33] would have been there in the Kidron
[53:34] Valley somewhere on the side of the
[53:36] mountain
[53:37] and he turns and says now whoever will
[53:40] say to this mountain so he turns maybe
[53:43] turns his body around and he's standing
[53:46] looking like this so there is the Mount
[53:48] of Olives
[53:50] who will say to this mountain
[53:53] now we know he's not literally speaking
[53:56] about the mountain itself but he was
[53:58] speaking in a parable because that
[54:01] mountain the Lord Jesus Will descend
[54:03] upon that mountain according to the book
[54:05] of Zechariah the prophecy and he will
[54:08] come so that scripture could not been
[54:10] pertaining to that mountain literally
[54:12] but it was a parable but he wanted to
[54:16] just blow their minds he wanted just so
[54:20] blow their sinking to what they thought
[54:24] Faith really was
[54:26] so he turns to the Mount of Olives and
[54:28] said you think that's something
[54:31] I'll say to you
[54:33] that if you will believe and not doubt
[54:36] in your heart and you'll have faith that
[54:39] whosoever shall say to this mountain
[54:43] be thou removed
[54:45] and be thou cast into the sea
[54:49] now that within itself would have been a
[54:52] pretty phenomenal thing you're going to
[54:54] say to a mountain
[54:56] be thou removed and the Mount of Olives
[54:59] will pick up
[55:01] and be cast into the sea anybody know
[55:04] where the nearest sea was
[55:07] the Sea of Galilee
[55:10] many miles away
[55:14] now the Lord Jesus says something that
[55:17] seems like an impossibility
[55:20] but he wanted to do that in order to get
[55:24] them to focus on what the church can
[55:27] really do if they'll see who they are
[55:31] now also said no one ever moved the mall
[55:34] of Olives anyone even speaking about it
[55:37] per se but it was what is called a
[55:40] hyperbole
[55:41] which is something that is stretched out
[55:44] so far beyond reality in order to show
[55:48] you a spiritual symbol so he's saying
[55:52] something that will never happen
[55:54] something that absolutely he never
[55:57] intended to happen but he wanted to use
[55:59] something in a parabolical form that
[56:02] they would look at it and look at one
[56:03] another and say you've got to be kidding
[56:05] me you mean if I really believe I could
[56:08] say to the Mount of Olives be thou cast
[56:11] into the sin of course they were From
[56:13] Galilee and they knew how far it was
[56:16] from there to Galilee so a miracle to be
[56:19] able to speak to the mountain and the
[56:21] mountain be plucked up and another
[56:23] miracle that by your word that mountain
[56:26] would carry in the air
[56:32] for miles and miles and miles and miles
[56:37] and be set down in the Sea of Galilee
[56:42] you see when you look at it in that
[56:44] setting it's no wonder that the
[56:46] scripture so stumped the prophet and it
[56:50] would cause him to Marvel at why the
[56:54] Lord Jesus would say it this way how
[56:56] about that minus read it again verily I
[56:59] say unto you that whosoever shall say
[57:01] unto this mountain be thou removed and
[57:03] be thou cast into the sea and shall not
[57:07] doubt in his heart
[57:09] but Shall Believe though that those
[57:12] things which he says
[57:16] now this is what got the prophet
[57:18] it wasn't what God Said
[57:22] it's what you said
[57:28] well I guess we might as well dismiss
[57:29] and go home from the looks of y'all's
[57:31] faces
[57:33] you mean a person
[57:36] could receive something from God
[57:40] in such a way
[57:42] and God would use their mouths to say it
[57:46] and if they believed it was God
[57:50] even as great as a mountain could be
[57:52] moved out of their way
[57:55] I notice this
[57:58] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[58:01] the sea and shall not doubt in his heart
[58:06] but shall believe that those things
[58:09] which he says
[58:13] shall come to pass
[58:17] he shall have
[58:20] whatsoever
[58:22] he saith
[58:25] I wonder how many of us are there today
[58:31] you know see my hand's flying up do you
[58:35] I wonder how far we are Church
[58:38] beneath what the Lord
[58:41] wants us to be
[58:44] now we thank my goodness to disbelieve
[58:48] God's word that's a terrible thing and
[58:49] it is
[58:51] but can you imagine god making a word so
[58:55] real to you
[58:57] that it would be a sin
[58:59] for you to believe
[59:01] disbelief
[59:03] your
[59:08] praise the Lord now as I said it's not
[59:11] church as usual today
[59:14] now God knew that that
[59:20] on the earth that would ever Embrace
[59:22] This Promise
[59:25] but he said it nonetheless it's not said
[59:28] for the masses
[59:30] the majority of Christianity people
[59:32] never even understands such a thing
[59:35] notice verse 24. therefore I say unto
[59:40] you the master saying unto the servants
[59:44] what things so ever
[59:48] ye desire When you pray
[59:52] believe that ye
[59:55] receive them
[59:57] I want you to notice a word that Jesus
[1:00:00] did not use here in the receiving part
[1:00:03] and it was Will
[1:00:06] or shall
[1:00:08] but can you imagine a person that when
[1:00:12] they believe it
[1:00:15] they actually get it
[1:00:17] right then
[1:00:22] now this is not my words my words will
[1:00:25] be debatable You could argue these are
[1:00:27] not words to argue with this morning
[1:00:30] listen again carefully
[1:00:32] I'm speaking to you now about the
[1:00:34] bride's rights
[1:00:35] therefore I say unto you that what
[1:00:38] things so ever ye desire When you pray
[1:00:42] believe that ye receives them
[1:00:47] and you shall have some now notice he
[1:00:50] doesn't put the shall before the receive
[1:00:53] but with real face you believe that you
[1:00:57] already have them
[1:00:59] before you actually get them
[1:01:02] now I want you to notice this word I
[1:01:05] looked at it this morning and studying
[1:01:07] on it for a bit the simple little word
[1:01:09] received and most of us probably feel
[1:01:11] like we know what it means but just give
[1:01:14] me a few minutes just to verify it for
[1:01:16] you now he says if you will believe that
[1:01:20] ye receive
[1:01:23] received the word receive means take lay
[1:01:27] hold of
[1:01:29] any person or saying in order to use it
[1:01:33] to take what is one's own
[1:01:37] so it's already yours
[1:01:41] now what are we talking about we're
[1:01:43] talking about substance faith
[1:01:46] which is perfect faith it's a step
[1:01:50] beyond our intellectual Faith to where
[1:01:53] we sat and hear it preached over and
[1:01:55] over and over and over again and then we
[1:01:58] build up a knowledge about it yes I
[1:02:00] believe Malachi 4 I believe Mark 16 I
[1:02:02] believe Saint John 14 12 these Saints
[1:02:04] are fall then they believe I believe I
[1:02:06] believe I believe I believe and that's
[1:02:08] good nothing wrong with that but you and
[1:02:10] I have faced things in our life that
[1:02:13] intellectual faith will not conquer it
[1:02:16] takes the face of Jesus himself
[1:02:20] I don't believe that our face alone will
[1:02:24] ever meet The Challenge of the hour that
[1:02:27] lays before us I believe it'll take this
[1:02:29] Faith right here so I want you noticing
[1:02:32] that Jesus uses this word in the Greek
[1:02:34] Aramaic language and that this was the
[1:02:37] meaning of it to take what is one's own
[1:02:41] so it's already been revealed to you
[1:02:44] that it is yours and what you're doing
[1:02:47] the word receiving is that you're taking
[1:02:50] what is already yours God's done
[1:02:54] revealed it to you and the work is over
[1:02:57] it don't matter in heaven it's what the
[1:02:59] doctor says what anybody else says as
[1:03:01] far as you're concerned it's a finished
[1:03:03] work
[1:03:04] to take what is one's own to make one's
[1:03:09] own to claim of that which when taken is
[1:03:15] not let go to seize
[1:03:19] to see so to receive then is to seize
[1:03:23] upon the Divine promise of God made
[1:03:27] personal to you by divine revelation you
[1:03:31] seize your possession even though you do
[1:03:34] not have one physical proof one material
[1:03:38] proof one scientific proof that one
[1:03:42] thing has happened but you don't even
[1:03:44] care because to you it is already
[1:03:49] substance now we're talking about
[1:03:51] perfect Faith so what is perfect Faith
[1:03:55] what differentiates it between that and
[1:03:58] regular Faith well regular faith faith
[1:04:01] is the substance of things hoped for
[1:04:03] with the evidence of Things Not Seen and
[1:04:06] that type of faith will do lots of
[1:04:09] things many of the New Testament
[1:04:10] miracles in the days of the Lord Jesus
[1:04:12] it was that simple Faith they heard
[1:04:15] about a Son of God they believed it was
[1:04:17] the Messiah and their needs were great
[1:04:19] and they simply believed it they did not
[1:04:21] have a bible to read they did not have
[1:04:23] tapes to listen to they had no New
[1:04:26] Testament preachers there were no such a
[1:04:28] thing but their needs were so great and
[1:04:31] the gospel in its simple stage was able
[1:04:33] to touch the common people and they
[1:04:36] heard the word and they believed it and
[1:04:38] if you notice many times when the
[1:04:40] authors would write they would talk
[1:04:41] about how desperate their needs was the
[1:04:44] sorrowful Nation woman having a daughter
[1:04:46] that was grievously vexed of the devil
[1:04:49] it does not mention how great an
[1:04:51] understanding of the word was it was the
[1:04:54] need was so great and so pressing and so
[1:04:57] against them they needed help so bad you
[1:05:00] understand what I'm saying so it wasn't
[1:05:02] like that they had this great Paramount
[1:05:04] revelation of the word they really
[1:05:06] didn't it shows they didn't understand
[1:05:08] who he was because some of them that got
[1:05:11] healed were part of the throng and the
[1:05:13] multitude that cried a little while
[1:05:15] later crucified this guy he's a
[1:05:17] blasphemer so it proves they did not
[1:05:20] have real Revelation Faith but yet they
[1:05:24] had faith that was momentary they had
[1:05:27] faith that was a pulsation something
[1:05:28] that dropped down and they were able to
[1:05:31] get what they need at the time but it
[1:05:33] never LED them to Salvation never LED
[1:05:35] them to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:37] nothing wrong with that type of Faith
[1:05:39] but I want a faith that'll lead me on
[1:05:42] don't you I don't want to just be healed
[1:05:44] I want to be say I want to be delivered
[1:05:47] I want to be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:05:48] I want to be raptured ultimately out of
[1:05:51] this world so I want you to notice now
[1:05:53] that the Lord Jesus is bringing
[1:05:56] something to the apostles that no doubt
[1:05:58] they must have got together later and
[1:06:00] talked about did you understand what he
[1:06:02] was saying what about you did it make
[1:06:04] any sense to you I don't understand what
[1:06:06] in the world he was getting out because
[1:06:07] he's saying that we could actually say
[1:06:10] something well he had given them the
[1:06:12] pattern of him cursing the Fig Tree he's
[1:06:15] fixing to tell him of course further on
[1:06:17] in the gospels and Matthew that whatever
[1:06:19] they would bind on Earth would act
[1:06:22] should be bound in heaven he's also
[1:06:24] going to go on and tell them whoever
[1:06:27] sins that you remit they are remitted
[1:06:30] and whoever sins you retain they are
[1:06:34] retained oh my yo I believe the church
[1:06:37] God's representative on the Earth is
[1:06:40] going to come to her full position
[1:06:42] before we leave this world in a rapture
[1:06:45] now notice the Lord Jesus bringing in
[1:06:48] the gospel and I wonder how many years
[1:06:51] it was before they first began to really
[1:06:54] understand these passages of scripture I
[1:06:57] know that some of you read them for
[1:06:58] years I'm wondering how many of us said
[1:07:00] here today and understand them now does
[1:07:02] this mean that we're going to go around
[1:07:04] and just say things well this is going
[1:07:06] to come to pass and that's going to come
[1:07:07] to pass and this is going to happen now
[1:07:09] we've seen a bunch of that stuff we want
[1:07:12] it to be only when God sovereignly gives
[1:07:15] it to us now can that happen to a person
[1:07:18] that's not a preacher of course you
[1:07:19] can't I'd happen to a woman that's
[1:07:21] filled with the Holy Ghost yep sure can
[1:07:23] but it will not be at will it will not
[1:07:27] be whenever we say well I want this to
[1:07:29] happen tomorrow we don't have no say
[1:07:32] when it happens how it happens or who it
[1:07:34] happens to it is sovereignly given by
[1:07:37] God remember the question answer 64.
[1:07:40] brother Branham if you were pressed upon
[1:07:43] would you speak someone into a certain
[1:07:46] condition now the prophet catches that
[1:07:48] question to me it sounds like a muddled
[1:07:51] up mess but he caught that question and
[1:07:53] said now the person here has got a very
[1:07:56] good question now he said what they're
[1:07:58] saying and what they're referring to
[1:08:00] they didn't say this of course but he
[1:08:02] said what they're referring to is the
[1:08:04] speaking of the word now the person was
[1:08:07] asking that if they themselves were in a
[1:08:10] state a spiritual State and they could
[1:08:12] not overcome something override
[1:08:14] something what a profit able to speak
[1:08:17] the word and speak them into a state of
[1:08:21] perfection now then brother random
[1:08:23] answers this and he says well you know
[1:08:25] that's a really good question but they
[1:08:27] said they're referring to the speaking
[1:08:29] of the squirrels and all that but he
[1:08:30] said if you don't notice that was
[1:08:33] sovereignly given brother random did not
[1:08:35] ask for squirrels brother random did not
[1:08:38] ask for that to be despite unhatti right
[1:08:40] is that right
[1:08:42] he did not ask for his own wife he did
[1:08:45] not ask for those things but something
[1:08:47] dropped down in the room where he was
[1:08:51] what is that something or should I say
[1:08:53] who is that something so it is not
[1:08:56] something that we as the people of God
[1:08:59] will control at will well today I'm
[1:09:01] going to go out and I'm going to empty
[1:09:03] the hospitals tomorrow I'm going to go
[1:09:04] over here and I'm going to do that the
[1:09:06] Bible never teaches any such nonsense
[1:09:08] the apostles never done that they were
[1:09:11] led by the Holy Ghost so I think it
[1:09:14] ought to really motivate us to be closer
[1:09:17] to God than we've ever been in our
[1:09:19] entire lives
[1:09:20] and the Saints said
[1:09:22] so Faith accepts this as it's as good as
[1:09:28] done even though the actual answer is
[1:09:32] still in the future Faith accepts it as
[1:09:37] if it's already done though the evidence
[1:09:41] may not be made manifest for quite some
[1:09:44] time and the church said now would you
[1:09:47] notice how Jesus then goes from this
[1:09:50] great revelation of faith into verse 25
[1:09:53] Mark 11 25 and when ye stand praying now
[1:09:58] that breaks some of our traditions
[1:10:00] because we think God only hears us
[1:10:02] whenever we kneel but actually if you'll
[1:10:05] study the Jewish custom you'll find out
[1:10:07] that they did much of their praying
[1:10:09] standing up for those of you who have
[1:10:11] ever been to the Wailing Wall or the
[1:10:14] Western Wall as they call it and it's
[1:10:16] the remnants of some of the blocks of
[1:10:18] stone that was part of the herodian
[1:10:21] temple and they in the years later they
[1:10:23] come and lined them up and there's big
[1:10:25] cracks inside of those stones and those
[1:10:28] Jews come in Christians as well and they
[1:10:31] will write their prayer requests and
[1:10:33] stuff them inside I mean absolutely tens
[1:10:36] of thousands of them they've done it for
[1:10:38] years and years and years and whenever
[1:10:40] they stand there and the real Jews you
[1:10:42] don't have to wonder really who the Jews
[1:10:44] are because whenever they stand there
[1:10:46] they will read a portion of the book of
[1:10:48] Psalms and when they stand there the men
[1:10:51] will stand there like this and they will
[1:10:53] have the little skull cap on the back
[1:10:55] they make you as a gentile also wear one
[1:10:57] I wore one whenever I went down there I
[1:11:00] didn't stand there and do this because I
[1:11:02] didn't really think I needed to but they
[1:11:04] stand there because they say that you
[1:11:06] cannot read the book of Psalms without
[1:11:09] getting stimulated I kind of do like
[1:11:11] that idea though but they would stand
[1:11:13] there and you didn't see any of them or
[1:11:15] I never I've been there a couple of
[1:11:16] times I never saw one of them or the Rob
[1:11:19] actually kneeling down so they were
[1:11:22] staying and I think it's a trick of the
[1:11:24] devil to get us in our mind thinking
[1:11:27] that our body has to be in a certain
[1:11:29] posture before the Lord will hear our
[1:11:32] prayer
[1:11:33] but the Lord Jesus said when you stand
[1:11:36] pray well if it's more reverent to be
[1:11:38] kneeling wouldn't he say that now those
[1:11:41] times that I actually prostrate myself
[1:11:43] before the Lord and I will lay flat on
[1:11:46] my face flat right down on my body
[1:11:48] totally right down on on my face before
[1:11:51] the Lord and I will lay there till ever
[1:11:53] I get done but I don't do that all the
[1:11:55] time because my nose is big enough and I
[1:11:57] sure don't look like a D9 hit me in the
[1:11:59] face so but you know in our thinking in
[1:12:02] the Satan does that to rob you so that
[1:12:05] you think that you can't pray on the job
[1:12:08] and you can't Pray when you're at Lowe's
[1:12:10] and you can't Pray when you you can pray
[1:12:12] almost anywhere at any time and it's
[1:12:16] nothing but the devil to try to convince
[1:12:19] you that the Lord Jesus only hears you
[1:12:21] well that's not what he said himself so
[1:12:24] notice now how it's going to bring into
[1:12:26] perspective of perfect Faith another
[1:12:29] great great thing he said when you stand
[1:12:32] praying and forgive now we've gone from
[1:12:35] speaking the word and God dropping a
[1:12:38] Rhema word inside of your mouth and you
[1:12:41] speaking that word and you believing
[1:12:43] what you've said will come to pass they
[1:12:45] can imagine when brother Brennan was
[1:12:47] there and the squirrels in Kentucky
[1:12:48] whenever this happened and he was so
[1:12:51] overwhelmed so he began to speak let the
[1:12:54] one come here it'll do this that and the
[1:12:55] other and he shows spots that a squirrel
[1:12:58] does not go it doesn't go through Poison
[1:13:01] Ivy and it doesn't go through here and
[1:13:02] there it just won't do it but he spoke
[1:13:05] it that way because he wanted to prove
[1:13:07] that it was something Supernatural and
[1:13:09] divine and yet but whatever he said Here
[1:13:12] I Am Lord something's happening here I
[1:13:14] am beside myself what in the world is
[1:13:16] going on and he got up and he was ready
[1:13:19] to leave and the voice said but you said
[1:13:22] so many you said do you doubt what you
[1:13:27] said
[1:13:29] do you doubt what you said
[1:13:33] no Lord no Lord he sold the sign himself
[1:13:37] no Lord I believe where will it come
[1:13:40] speak it now God was not speaking it
[1:13:44] but the prophet was
[1:13:46] oh Lord
[1:13:48] children don't give up on your family
[1:13:52] don't give up on your sons your
[1:13:55] daughters your grandkids your family
[1:13:57] members that God keeps burning you for
[1:14:00] and you say oh if I could just get your
[1:14:03] mother wrong oh if I could get your
[1:14:05] brother Tim if I could get your mother
[1:14:06] down maybe that speak a word Maybe
[1:14:10] but what if God wants to use the mouse
[1:14:13] of the mother what if God wants to use
[1:14:17] the mouse of the father when the father
[1:14:19] is down praying and all the sudden the
[1:14:21] Holy Ghost so comes in the room where he
[1:14:24] is and he knows it's not his own word
[1:14:26] it's not his own inspiration but he says
[1:14:29] it in the name of the Lord Jesus I claim
[1:14:33] my son for the kingdom of God that devil
[1:14:36] that is holding his life let go house of
[1:14:39] hell you can no longer hold my son my
[1:14:42] daughter my wife my husband and by Your
[1:14:46] Word God will set them free
[1:14:50] now don't sit there look at me funny I
[1:14:52] believe that the Holy Ghost is not only
[1:14:56] in the ministry I believe the Holy Ghost
[1:15:00] is in the body of Christ
[1:15:02] [Applause]
[1:15:03] Hallelujah now I want you to notice that
[1:15:07] Jesus speaking is such a great thing
[1:15:09] about faith but notice what he ties in
[1:15:13] with such great faith and when you stand
[1:15:16] praying forgive
[1:15:19] wow so we're just talking about speaking
[1:15:22] the word and then he goes from speaking
[1:15:25] the word to forgiveness why because you
[1:15:29] will not be able to have this open
[1:15:31] Channel between you and God if you've
[1:15:33] got a spirit of unforgiveness
[1:15:36] now I know this probably ain't for
[1:15:38] nobody here this morning but I'm going
[1:15:40] to say it for some of them sorry dogs
[1:15:42] that stream the services and some of you
[1:15:44] little angels here you better with me
[1:15:46] and give me a few minutes will you while
[1:15:48] I'm dealing with whoever this is out
[1:15:49] there where's them cameras out this
[1:15:51] morning all right you sorry thing let me
[1:15:53] get a view up here and you up there
[1:15:55] maybe maybe it's our brother down and
[1:15:57] Patagonia Chile Where I got an email
[1:16:00] from him where he was talking about the
[1:16:02] services were they seem can you imagine
[1:16:04] down there I'm painting Chile all the
[1:16:07] way down in South America and God is
[1:16:10] reaching people oh yeah he's reaching
[1:16:12] them all over the world why he's getting
[1:16:14] the people ready to go for the Rapture
[1:16:16] so maybe you said that brother there but
[1:16:19] let me say this you'll never be able to
[1:16:21] move and that type of Harmony was God if
[1:16:25] you have an unforgiving spirit
[1:16:28] now there's a great difference and an
[1:16:30] unforgiving spirit and you and I with
[1:16:33] our human makeup may be being made in
[1:16:35] such a way and there's certain strains
[1:16:37] that run in families that some families
[1:16:39] find it very hard to forgive people
[1:16:42] that's not necessarily a spirit it's a
[1:16:45] trait or a nature that runs in that
[1:16:47] family now I don't expect amends for the
[1:16:49] next little bit maybe some of them on
[1:16:51] the internet can at least just blink
[1:16:53] their lights or something so let me know
[1:16:55] or hurt somebody thank you there brother
[1:16:56] but yet there are some people that
[1:16:59] really really struggle with being able
[1:17:02] to forgive people now when people will
[1:17:05] trespass against them and hurt their
[1:17:07] feelings and maybe say something and
[1:17:09] we've all been there and done that
[1:17:11] haven't we we've all had our feelings
[1:17:13] hurt we've been disappointed and let
[1:17:14] down by people and I dare say probably
[1:17:17] most of us have hurt as many as have
[1:17:19] hurt us if not the other way around well
[1:17:21] go ahead and say Amen you might as well
[1:17:23] we want to let on like we're the ones
[1:17:26] that get hurt all the time our mind is
[1:17:28] too fat and we're all too much
[1:17:31] blabbermouths to tell me that we've not
[1:17:33] hurt people with our fat jaws and our
[1:17:36] mouth flapping when we ought to be quiet
[1:17:38] and listening preach Melody
[1:17:42] well Hallelujah
[1:17:46] so the Lord Jesus now is bringing this
[1:17:49] in what I find astounding is if you get
[1:17:51] time and you'd like to listen to this
[1:17:53] message entitle perfect faith that when
[1:17:55] the prophet reads this very scripture
[1:17:57] here in Mark 11 and then he bases the
[1:18:01] subject perfect face on these scriptures
[1:18:04] I just read to you this morning and then
[1:18:06] right after reading the scripture
[1:18:08] they're the very next words that he says
[1:18:09] in the following paragraph is so we see
[1:18:12] that faith is based upon forgiveness
[1:18:17] oh amen I thought that Faith was based
[1:18:20] upon hearing the word well that type of
[1:18:23] face is but now we're looking at a face
[1:18:26] that is beyond just what church members
[1:18:29] have let me tell you something friends
[1:18:31] the more you look into uh you know a lot
[1:18:35] of these folks that don't believe
[1:18:36] there's a God and we evolve from a
[1:18:38] monkey and we evolve from an ape and
[1:18:40] some of that stuff you know I've been
[1:18:42] looking at some of the stuff of what
[1:18:44] they say and I realize it takes more
[1:18:47] faith to believe what they believe that
[1:18:49] it does for you and I believe in the
[1:18:51] beginning God created the heavens and
[1:18:52] the earth I mean we just got a simple
[1:18:55] faith and we believe it to believe a one
[1:18:57] cell deal got out there in the middle of
[1:18:59] a green pond scum and it turned into all
[1:19:02] this stuff we got today that would take
[1:19:04] a lot of things amen but yet you realize
[1:19:08] that this element of face now with an
[1:19:11] intellectual Faith a person can believe
[1:19:13] God tap into certain aspects of the
[1:19:16] promise of God and still will be one
[1:19:18] that does not forgive yeah because it
[1:19:21] won't really hinder their intellectual
[1:19:23] Faith because they think they're all
[1:19:24] right and they will hide behind that
[1:19:26] Flaws by the iron mentioned here
[1:19:28] Wednesday night didn't he do a beautiful
[1:19:29] job well that's just my family it's just
[1:19:32] the way we are well you see your
[1:19:34] intellectual Faith we'll make excuses
[1:19:36] for that but when you break into this
[1:19:39] realm of Faith now you're standing
[1:19:42] without your prayer for a loved one God
[1:19:45] my daughters got to need my son's got to
[1:19:48] need all Lord I need a word oh God I
[1:19:51] need something
[1:19:52] I know while you're praying that way all
[1:19:54] of a sudden
[1:19:55] you remember you did something to
[1:19:57] somebody
[1:19:59] or said something to somebody
[1:20:02] wow what a peculiar time not really
[1:20:05] because if you're in the spirit of
[1:20:07] prayer it's the best time for God to
[1:20:09] deal with you
[1:20:12] when you stand praying for give
[1:20:16] So Divine forgiveness toward a Believer
[1:20:21] and a believer's forgiveness toward
[1:20:25] another believer are associated together
[1:20:30] in reality you cannot not have the Deep
[1:20:33] degree of one without having the Deep
[1:20:35] degree of the other
[1:20:37] those who cannot forgive men their
[1:20:41] trespasses aren't truly forgiven before
[1:20:44] God
[1:20:45] oh Jesus
[1:20:48] Hallelujah
[1:20:50] well sit there and look at me and then
[1:20:52] I'll read you the scripture on it and
[1:20:53] then I'll look back at you when I do
[1:20:56] now notice when you stand praying
[1:20:59] forgive if ye have ought against any
[1:21:05] that your father also which is in heaven
[1:21:11] you mean mind forgiveness
[1:21:15] is based upon
[1:21:17] my forgiveness whoa
[1:21:21] whoa I thought my forgiveness was based
[1:21:23] upon him
[1:21:26] you see if I don't forgive people then
[1:21:29] my day to forgiven I don't get this
[1:21:31] mixed up
[1:21:32] my forgiveness of being a sinner is
[1:21:35] already taken care of and that can only
[1:21:37] come from him
[1:21:39] but what we're talking about after a
[1:21:41] child of God is your daily forgiveness
[1:21:44] that every one of you including me need
[1:21:47] every day of your life
[1:21:50] now do you understand you not forgiving
[1:21:52] someone else does not mean that you're
[1:21:54] not a Christian no that comes by the
[1:21:57] initial forgiveness of the Lord Jesus
[1:21:59] but your daily forgiveness will stop
[1:22:04] when you for refuse
[1:22:06] to forgive someone else
[1:22:11] so you say something wrong you do
[1:22:13] something wrong you look at something
[1:22:15] wrong you have a bad attitude temper you
[1:22:19] know whatever it is and you say the
[1:22:21] words oh Lord forgive me oh Lord forgive
[1:22:23] me
[1:22:24] but he actually does not
[1:22:27] because you'll not forgive so and so
[1:22:29] their trespasses against you
[1:22:34] praise the Lord can I go on y'all want
[1:22:37] me to stop go on all right
[1:22:43] so watch now so Divine forgiveness now
[1:22:46] remember this is not human forgiveness
[1:22:47] this is divine capability
[1:22:51] Divine forgiveness
[1:22:55] toward a Believer is linked together
[1:22:58] with his Divine forgiveness back to you
[1:23:04] now remember these are the words of the
[1:23:06] Lord Jesus we believe it right notice
[1:23:08] verse 26 but if ye do not forgive
[1:23:17] oh my goodness
[1:23:19] neither
[1:23:20] will your father which is in heaven
[1:23:25] forgive your trespasses
[1:23:28] you mean so me receiving daily
[1:23:30] forgiveness is stopped halted
[1:23:36] comes to a screeching halt
[1:23:40] until I can forgive whoever it is that
[1:23:43] has done me wrong
[1:23:47] praise the Lord
[1:23:49] wow could this be one reason why
[1:23:53] we don't see a greater manifestation of
[1:23:55] God's presence in our midst
[1:23:58] oh it's so much easier to let your hair
[1:24:01] grow out sometimes and your brothers
[1:24:03] quit whining this and that and the other
[1:24:05] and quit doing this and that that's on
[1:24:06] the outside this is inside stuff
[1:24:09] this is inside stuff forgiven nobody
[1:24:12] even knows him maybe your wife or your
[1:24:13] husband don't even know that you've got
[1:24:15] a grievance or you've got an all against
[1:24:17] someone you have and you go to pray it
[1:24:19] bothers you I don't know I need to I
[1:24:20] know I need to I'm going to fix that
[1:24:22] thing one of these days why not today
[1:24:23] why not today go ahead and declare war
[1:24:26] on it today and say by God's grace I'm
[1:24:29] going to put this thing under my feet
[1:24:31] oh my brother Donnie you don't know how
[1:24:33] bad I've been hurt I'm sure that I don't
[1:24:35] and I'm sure you don't know how about
[1:24:37] I've been hurt since I've been a
[1:24:38] Christian most of my life so you know
[1:24:41] you don't expect you don't expect really
[1:24:43] much out of Sinners but out of
[1:24:45] Christians you expect them to be people
[1:24:47] of honesty and integrity and character
[1:24:49] right and you expect them to love one
[1:24:51] another and pray for one another and so
[1:24:53] on and so on and so on so where's my
[1:24:55] greatest hurts come from where's yours
[1:24:57] come from Christians
[1:24:59] anybody say Amen women who have you been
[1:25:02] the most disappointed in uh the guy down
[1:25:05] at the bar or the guy somewhere you know
[1:25:07] robbing a bank he really disappointed
[1:25:09] you why you shouldn't that's the way he
[1:25:11] is or has it been Christians that you
[1:25:13] went to church with
[1:25:18] now you see these are inseparably linked
[1:25:22] together
[1:25:24] but my husband I'll tell you what he
[1:25:26] done so and so I'll I'll never forgive
[1:25:29] him
[1:25:30] which means God will never again
[1:25:33] forgive you
[1:25:45] let's read it again the words of the
[1:25:47] Lord Jesus and Word of Life says
[1:25:50] [Music]
[1:25:52] but if ye do not
[1:25:55] forgive
[1:25:57] neither will your father
[1:26:01] so we're not talking about Chris sinners
[1:26:03] now holding grudges but we're talking
[1:26:06] about real children of God and so much
[1:26:09] that Jesus called these children
[1:26:12] the children of God and call God their
[1:26:15] father you mean a Christian can hold
[1:26:19] such an unforgiving spirit and an
[1:26:22] unforgiving attitude
[1:26:24] don't nobody about a nine now
[1:26:26] don't nobody's cheeks turn all red
[1:26:28] because you'll tell on yourself sure is
[1:26:30] the world
[1:26:31] a Christian can do that yes my brother
[1:26:34] sister I've met him around the world
[1:26:37] around the world and you and I have you
[1:26:40] we all know how we are as human beings
[1:26:42] and we are so faulty and so flawed some
[1:26:46] people have no problem at all being able
[1:26:49] to see all kinds of faults I mean they
[1:26:51] can see it they look this way they see
[1:26:53] it they look that way and the only
[1:26:55] Direction they see no fault is when they
[1:26:58] turn their eyes toward their self and
[1:27:00] they see God's perfect holy example of a
[1:27:03] Christian
[1:27:04] and they just don't understand why
[1:27:06] everybody else don't want to be just
[1:27:08] like them God only had one example and
[1:27:11] that wasn't you
[1:27:13] it was the Lord Jesus himself
[1:27:17] praise the Lord
[1:27:21] so a person then can have a level of
[1:27:24] intellectual faith and be able to make
[1:27:26] certain Promises of God come to pass
[1:27:28] maybe they can break into the aspect of
[1:27:31] being able to tithe and give and they'll
[1:27:33] say God said give and it'll be given
[1:27:35] unto you shaken down press together I'll
[1:27:37] call men to give unto your bosom they
[1:27:39] don't live right a bit more nothing but
[1:27:41] yet they will finance I've known of
[1:27:43] people over the years that were not even
[1:27:45] Christians and they would support
[1:27:47] missions and they would support radio
[1:27:50] preachers and television preachers
[1:27:51] remember I was a Pentecostal so I worked
[1:27:53] with a guy that was on television I
[1:27:55] worked with him and him for years I was
[1:27:57] there with him and I knew a little bit
[1:27:59] about the finances and there was people
[1:28:01] that was business people coal operators
[1:28:04] in that part of West Virginia and they
[1:28:06] would give him thousands times thousands
[1:28:08] of dollars and they would have been more
[1:28:10] Christians than Nelson and God would
[1:28:12] bless them and bless them financially
[1:28:15] and they found that out and they worked
[1:28:18] on that one promise of God you say that
[1:28:20] into messages yes it is spoken words
[1:28:22] original receipt now notice in God don't
[1:28:25] just want his bride to all to be able to
[1:28:28] operate on the aspect of tithes and
[1:28:30] offerings on the aspect of receiving
[1:28:32] Divine Healing God wants us to operate
[1:28:34] on the ultimate aspect that one day we
[1:28:37] will be looking in the mirror and the
[1:28:39] sweep will come over our bodies and
[1:28:41] we'll be changed we're not just this
[1:28:44] this this disciple ends with this
[1:28:47] generation do you understand this cycle
[1:28:50] of life and death has been ongoing for
[1:28:53] thousands of years I believe I can say
[1:28:56] about all of my heart and not be out of
[1:28:59] the continuity of God's word I believe
[1:29:01] in this generation the cycle of life and
[1:29:06] death and burial will be interrupted
[1:29:09] forever I believe there are people in
[1:29:12] this building today who will not die but
[1:29:16] will be changed by the power of God it's
[1:29:20] going to take more
[1:29:22] it's going to take more faith in Wesley
[1:29:25] it's going to take more faith than
[1:29:27] Pentecost it's got to be an end time
[1:29:30] faith for an end time people for an end
[1:29:34] time revelation
[1:29:35] [Applause]
[1:29:45] so here you are you're praying
[1:29:48] on your face and your closet standing
[1:29:50] wherever it is you really need something
[1:29:53] from God you're desperate
[1:29:55] oh God I need I need I need this I need
[1:29:59] that and sometimes we don't even know
[1:30:00] what we need you know what I'm saying we
[1:30:02] get down we just don't even watch him
[1:30:03] pray for I've been there many a Time he
[1:30:06] just don't watch even asking
[1:30:09] but I'm glad I've got another language
[1:30:11] or two
[1:30:14] or three or four when I don't know how
[1:30:15] to pray
[1:30:17] sometimes I don't know how to pray for
[1:30:19] people
[1:30:21] and I'll pray and I'll pray
[1:30:24] and then all of a sudden I just let
[1:30:25] myself go
[1:30:27] and I'll start speaking in another
[1:30:28] language
[1:30:30] and every time he ever does that there's
[1:30:32] not a time that I don't see Divine
[1:30:35] Deliverance which that's crazy that
[1:30:37] ain't the message you need to listen to
[1:30:39] the message a little more as a matter of
[1:30:41] fact you'll find God's profit being
[1:30:42] there in a hotel room and Bill it coming
[1:30:44] to getting respect and brother man was
[1:30:46] down praying and he said he'd heard
[1:30:48] somebody thought speaking in German
[1:30:50] and they were speaking so fast and he
[1:30:52] said he thought I want you to listen to
[1:30:53] that man he is speaking so fast and he
[1:30:56] said come to find out it was me
[1:30:59] literally brother brought him no they
[1:31:00] were springing a woman across on the
[1:31:02] highway oh I think it was a 35 Chevrolet
[1:31:04] and the woman that hurt her body was in
[1:31:07] terrible terrible shape and her body
[1:31:10] began to bleed in Hemorrhage out in the
[1:31:12] back seat of the car and they pulled the
[1:31:14] woman out of the car on the side of the
[1:31:15] road and thought the woman was going to
[1:31:17] die brother random said it was an urgent
[1:31:19] need her angel come down in the hotel
[1:31:22] room where that Prophet was and begin to
[1:31:25] take his Mouse and pray out of him words
[1:31:29] he did not even know well come on
[1:31:31] somebody begin to pray out of him words
[1:31:35] that he did not know and the angel of
[1:31:38] the lord well they finally come on but
[1:31:40] God moved for the woman they brought
[1:31:42] wrong to the meeting course she's having
[1:31:43] a spell who wouldn't even some of the
[1:31:45] word alive folks might have shouted a
[1:31:47] little bit here at the point of death
[1:31:49] and God resurrects you and brings it up
[1:31:51] there and they run a microphone down
[1:31:53] there and said what time did this happen
[1:31:55] and they said it's a certain certain
[1:31:57] time it was the exact same time the
[1:31:59] prophet was down in the motel room and
[1:32:02] the spirit of God he said once that
[1:32:04] happened he felt like he could run the
[1:32:06] loop through a wall and run through a
[1:32:08] troop and vice versa why because the
[1:32:10] presence of God had moved in such a way
[1:32:12] all but we're messaged people right we
[1:32:15] don't believe in the Supernatural speak
[1:32:17] for yourself I believe we need the
[1:32:20] supernatural power to God greater than
[1:32:23] we've ever I'm not talking about
[1:32:25] fanaticism I'm not talking about 1906
[1:32:29] Pentecost I'm talking about the original
[1:32:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost with fire
[1:32:35] coming down changing our lives
[1:32:40] hey
[1:32:48] but if you
[1:32:50] listen now
[1:32:52] us here today if ye do not forgive
[1:32:57] neither will your father which is in
[1:32:59] heaven
[1:33:00] forgive your trespasses
[1:33:06] I don't know that's you I cannot imagine
[1:33:07] living one day
[1:33:09] with that scripture applying to me
[1:33:12] now maybe some of y'all are better than
[1:33:13] I am maybe I'll live closer to God than
[1:33:15] I am I sort of doubt it
[1:33:18] since I know most of you rotten sorry
[1:33:20] outfits
[1:33:23] not how much you're selling I'm talking
[1:33:25] about your body
[1:33:28] you ain't gonna tell me oh everybody
[1:33:29] comes there's angels of the Lord but
[1:33:31] have these preachers preaching the way
[1:33:32] they're preaching
[1:33:33] if everybody hears Angels they'd be
[1:33:35] preaching on the horizontal Rainbow on
[1:33:36] the dimensional light and so on and so
[1:33:38] forth but they preach on forgiveness and
[1:33:40] arguing and fussing well that tells me a
[1:33:42] whole lot right there
[1:33:43] that pretty well describes everybody
[1:33:45] around the message around the world
[1:33:47] don't it
[1:33:48] and that will be the great Paradox that
[1:33:50] God will be able to consummate the
[1:33:52] prophecy of his word with who Angels no
[1:33:56] human beings that were born lost human
[1:33:59] beings that were born contaminated what
[1:34:02] all types of flaws and failures and
[1:34:04] faulty things about them but the baptism
[1:34:06] of the Holy Ghost goes inside of their
[1:34:09] soul and changes them and makes them a
[1:34:11] new creature and little by little quote
[1:34:13] by quote take by tape service by service
[1:34:16] they say Lord I'm sorry I didn't realize
[1:34:18] I don't make it right Lord I'm sorry
[1:34:20] I'll make it right brother don't every
[1:34:21] time I go to church I'm hearing more
[1:34:23] about myself that ain't right well I'll
[1:34:25] say praise God to that that means the
[1:34:28] lord loves us and he wants to get us
[1:34:30] ready to leave this world if he didn't
[1:34:33] love you he would leave you where you
[1:34:36] are
[1:34:38] oh
[1:34:40] my God
[1:34:42] praise God
[1:34:48] so you're praying Lord Jesus please
[1:34:50] father help me and my family Lord please
[1:34:53] help me
[1:34:55] and all of a sudden
[1:34:57] you know that feeling you've got against
[1:34:59] so and so
[1:35:03] now Lord that ain't you
[1:35:06] that's that old devil
[1:35:09] get out of here devil
[1:35:15] isn't it amazing when we're in prayer
[1:35:19] and then something comes up
[1:35:22] now
[1:35:23] if that happens again
[1:35:25] about 383 times that I lacked on it
[1:35:32] is it any Wonder
[1:35:34] that we don't get any farther in Christ
[1:35:36] Jesus
[1:35:39] Saint John 15 7.
[1:35:42] if he abide in me
[1:35:46] and my words
[1:35:48] now we've looked at this before
[1:35:50] but this is not logos
[1:35:53] but Rhema
[1:35:55] click on it when you get home
[1:35:57] all you gotta do is go to the words here
[1:35:59] in your in your Bible and you can click
[1:36:01] on the word and it'll open it up to the
[1:36:02] Greek Lexicon it'll show you the meaning
[1:36:03] of the word it's Rhema
[1:36:07] that which applies for the hour what
[1:36:10] you're needing the current need
[1:36:14] notice how Jesus says this so if you
[1:36:16] abide me in my words my rhemas about you
[1:36:20] this is why folks can be full of logos
[1:36:22] and still miss the rapture
[1:36:24] that's what folks don't understand the
[1:36:26] necessity of a message in the end time
[1:36:28] well friends people have been reading
[1:36:30] this Bible and said in this Bible for
[1:36:32] thousands of years how studying the
[1:36:34] Bible alone produce the Rapture come on
[1:36:36] don't get quiet on me has it no people
[1:36:39] have had healing campaigns for years
[1:36:41] it's had healing campaigns produce a
[1:36:43] Rapture absolutely not
[1:36:46] it's having signs wonders and miracles
[1:36:48] I've seen all that in my Ministry and
[1:36:50] Pentecost I've seen all kinds of signs
[1:36:52] and wonders I've had science following
[1:36:54] my Ministry ever since I was a boy
[1:36:55] preacher it didn't just happen when I
[1:36:57] come to the message I had great science
[1:37:00] and Supernatural wonders why because
[1:37:02] that's what has taught us what I
[1:37:03] believed but yet we got to have more
[1:37:06] than that
[1:37:07] we've got to have more while we believe
[1:37:10] God sent a prophet yes we believe God
[1:37:12] sent a prophet but what did he say once
[1:37:15] he got here
[1:37:17] so if you abide in me about words abide
[1:37:20] in you ye shall ask
[1:37:25] what ye will
[1:37:29] not what I will
[1:37:35] but if you abide in me and my Rhema is
[1:37:38] abiding you then ask what you will but
[1:37:42] there again
[1:37:43] if this is happening in you you'll never
[1:37:46] ask him intentionally for anything
[1:37:49] that would be out of his will you know
[1:37:51] why his will and your will from your
[1:37:54] soul
[1:37:55] are the same thing
[1:37:57] now not the will of your flesh
[1:37:59] that's why it's all gone more than
[1:38:01] anything I want your word God more than
[1:38:03] anything I want to do what you want me
[1:38:05] to do your flesh don't want that
[1:38:07] but your soul if it's born again what's
[1:38:10] it want God I want you a will
[1:38:11] nevertheless not in my will but thy will
[1:38:14] be done so if you abide in me and my
[1:38:16] Ramos abide in you that ask what you
[1:38:19] want cause I know these category of
[1:38:21] people now categorically Jesus is
[1:38:24] speaking to a very small minute group of
[1:38:27] people down through a 2 000 year span of
[1:38:30] seven Church ages
[1:38:32] that would only be a few
[1:38:34] that would ever be able to grab this
[1:38:37] scripture
[1:38:38] and he would say this is yours
[1:38:41] this is your
[1:38:46] S I said that Senate brother Jason
[1:38:47] Watkins church and they like to pass out
[1:38:49] when I said it
[1:38:50] and I'll say it to you all
[1:38:52] there are certain scriptures in the
[1:38:54] Bible
[1:38:55] I have no desire to fulfill
[1:39:00] somebody's going through the tribulation
[1:39:01] period I don't desire to fulfill that
[1:39:03] one somebody's going to get to mark of
[1:39:05] the beast I don't desire to full vote
[1:39:07] somebody's going to stand before him and
[1:39:09] be judged and call them false anointed
[1:39:11] ones I don't desire to fulfill that one
[1:39:13] I do desire to fulfill this one
[1:39:15] if he abide me and my words abide in you
[1:39:19] ask what you will look friends look we
[1:39:22] can judge where we are spiritually in
[1:39:24] Christ Jesus by measuring the distance
[1:39:27] between our Wills
[1:39:31] that's your cage
[1:39:34] it's not the anointing it's not running
[1:39:36] it's not emotion we believe in all of
[1:39:37] that but yet we want to judge where we
[1:39:40] are about the gauge of our will
[1:39:44] our will and proximity
[1:39:47] to his
[1:39:51] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:39:54] you then I will give you this Freedom
[1:39:57] ask me what
[1:40:07] help me Jesus
[1:40:13] ask what
[1:40:17] what be done
[1:40:18] not maybe not perhaps it will be but the
[1:40:23] Criterion of this verse must be met
[1:40:26] you see people will quote this and then
[1:40:28] they're like well I want this or that
[1:40:30] the other uh God I ask in the name of
[1:40:32] Jesus and he told himself well that
[1:40:33] ain't true yes it's true but they did
[1:40:36] not meet the requirement of the
[1:40:37] Criterion that God demanded if ye abide
[1:40:40] in me and my words abide my words live
[1:40:44] my words motivate my words are your
[1:40:47] pleasure my words are your desire my
[1:40:50] words are what you live for Oh Glory to
[1:40:52] God while I go to church once a week
[1:40:54] whether I need to or not I pay my tithes
[1:40:56] and I can afford it I help the witty
[1:40:58] when I can afford it no you're not
[1:41:00] abiding in the word oh if you abide in
[1:41:02] me and my words about you they live
[1:41:04] there constantly they got you they lead
[1:41:07] you they correct you they encourage you
[1:41:10] then when you get that dead eyes what
[1:41:12] you will
[1:41:14] [Applause]
[1:41:15] [Music]
[1:41:18] herein
[1:41:20] is my father
[1:41:22] glorified
[1:41:24] that ye bear much fruit
[1:41:29] so shall you be
[1:41:32] my disciples
[1:41:35] oh
[1:41:37] you see they were first called
[1:41:39] Christians
[1:41:40] at Antioch
[1:41:43] today the term Christian
[1:41:46] is one that's been accepted now of
[1:41:49] course for several millennium
[1:41:52] but in that day to be called a Christian
[1:41:55] was not complementary at all
[1:41:58] it was Christos like Christos cristianos
[1:42:05] christianos
[1:42:07] so that's what the Romans would call
[1:42:09] them christianos
[1:42:12] and ridicule and Scorn
[1:42:15] and make fun of them
[1:42:18] but remember Jesus did not call his
[1:42:20] disciples Christians
[1:42:24] he called them disciples
[1:42:27] and what does the word disciple where
[1:42:29] does it come from the word disciplined
[1:42:34] so you disciple or you discipline
[1:42:37] how many used to get disciplined when
[1:42:39] you were little
[1:42:40] I talk about one two three four
[1:42:47] boy I've got my high tanned a few times
[1:42:50] now
[1:42:51] I don't mind telling you my daddy
[1:42:53] whenever he would come at me toward that
[1:42:55] big hand I think Lord that hand look
[1:42:57] like it's a foot wide and a foot long
[1:42:58] look like Goliath's hand coming at me
[1:43:01] and most of the time bless his heart
[1:43:03] he'd done it when he was mad when daddy
[1:43:05] woke me when he was mad that day and
[1:43:07] that made Donnie very sad
[1:43:10] well I probably didn't get near enough
[1:43:13] so Mama didn't want me that much the
[1:43:15] last one you've heard me tell it the
[1:43:16] last one that Mama gave me was I was
[1:43:18] fixing to get married in a few weeks
[1:43:20] Mama stood about that tall something
[1:43:22] like that and I said something smart to
[1:43:24] her I was fixing to drive to school I
[1:43:26] was a big boy now I had my license
[1:43:27] fixing to get married to that little
[1:43:29] lady setting over there before long so I
[1:43:32] figured I'd say some things I'd been
[1:43:34] wanting to say for a long time
[1:43:37] didn't take me long to realize I should
[1:43:39] have kept my big mouth shut when my
[1:43:41] little mama got done with me you know
[1:43:43] what I'd done I cooled off a little bit
[1:43:45] after she warmed me up and then I went
[1:43:48] and gotten my truck and went to school
[1:43:50] cried like a baby of course but you know
[1:43:52] what I realized not only did I cry cause
[1:43:55] Mama hurt me but I cried because I'd
[1:43:57] been so disrespectful to my mama I paid
[1:43:59] such disrespect to her because she loved
[1:44:02] us so much and yet discipline it's
[1:44:05] something that's so hard for Christians
[1:44:07] in this day our nation is where it is
[1:44:09] because she refuses the discipline of
[1:44:13] God our nation is turned into hell
[1:44:17] come on don't get quiet I mean that's
[1:44:19] why sodomy is rampant everywhere and
[1:44:21] it's not only rampant in the world but
[1:44:24] remember in the type it was there in
[1:44:27] sodomy where did Sodom where did lot
[1:44:29] wind up in the cities of Sodom look here
[1:44:33] the sodomites was knocking on lot's door
[1:44:36] look out at the denominations the
[1:44:38] denominations are open they're they're
[1:44:40] Church doors to trans and they're open
[1:44:43] their Church doors to drag shows or what
[1:44:46] they need it's a good display of the
[1:44:48] Holy Ghost instead of a bunch of dried
[1:44:50] coins getting our damn in the minds of
[1:44:52] the poor little kids come on don't sit
[1:44:54] there and look at me and yet we wonder
[1:44:57] where God is we wonder why God's not in
[1:45:00] the midst of the how can almighty God
[1:45:02] come to a nation who will allow such in
[1:45:06] their church and in their military come
[1:45:09] on somebody but if we will humble
[1:45:12] ourself and let the Lord God come into
[1:45:15] us and say God Walk with us cleanse us
[1:45:19] teach us help us Lord I believe the
[1:45:22] greatest things we have ever seen in our
[1:45:24] lives lay right before us
[1:45:33] foreign
[1:45:36] well I didn't even get to our Bill of
[1:45:38] Rights
[1:45:41] a whole few people out there and the
[1:45:43] internet's happy now
[1:45:44] you took my whole sermon and hijacked it
[1:45:47] from these bunch of little angels here
[1:45:48] they come to church all dressed up with
[1:45:51] their son to go to meet and close on and
[1:45:52] they come to be patted on the head and
[1:45:54] rubbed on the shoulder you bunch of
[1:45:56] sorry Sinners out there
[1:45:59] oh there might be one or two in here
[1:46:05] oh don't you love him
[1:46:10] you see these things
[1:46:12] we cannot manufacture
[1:46:17] all I used to sit in Pentecost were
[1:46:21] people would manufacture gifts and
[1:46:24] they would
[1:46:26] call people out Prophet tells us in the
[1:46:30] church age book
[1:46:31] they will operate a gift with a margin
[1:46:35] of error in it
[1:46:39] now you say it don't mean that
[1:46:40] everything about it is wrong
[1:46:42] but a margin of error
[1:46:46] oh my
[1:46:48] Harvest Time
[1:46:50] December 1964. brother Brown says Satan
[1:46:54] can hand out them Supernatural gifts
[1:46:57] by the handfuls
[1:47:01] can you imagine Satan handing out
[1:47:04] Supernatural gifts
[1:47:07] he'll do anything
[1:47:09] to get your focus off of God's word
[1:47:17] my some of them guys that I thought was
[1:47:19] so gifted
[1:47:21] come to find out that a girlfriend over
[1:47:23] here and one over there and one over
[1:47:25] there
[1:47:27] huh live one way in front of the people
[1:47:29] and live another women that's out by
[1:47:31] theirself
[1:47:35] but myself I desire
[1:47:38] to see Holiness righteousness
[1:47:42] purity
[1:47:43] when I say hold on I'm saying just
[1:47:44] talking about her sisters neither
[1:47:46] I believe this message of course
[1:47:48] homeless for the brothers
[1:47:51] uh-huh now we want to preach homeless
[1:47:53] and preach all over the women one got
[1:47:54] some of the Stars man there ever was
[1:47:56] hanging around the churches
[1:47:58] well preach brother Donnie
[1:48:02] may God help us
[1:48:04] may God help us
[1:48:08] what if God has allocated a word
[1:48:11] for your daughter
[1:48:13] or your son
[1:48:15] or your husband
[1:48:17] and that word cannot be spoken by God
[1:48:19] himself
[1:48:21] it cannot be spoken by an Angel
[1:48:24] it can only come through your lips
[1:48:28] God is waiting on you to get to a place
[1:48:31] to where when you pray
[1:48:33] this person will come up before you in
[1:48:35] that one and that one and you just kind
[1:48:36] of push it back and push it back
[1:48:38] but when you stand up before God and as
[1:48:40] John said and if our hearts condemn us
[1:48:43] not then we know we have the petition
[1:48:45] that we ask of him
[1:48:47] let me know something you stand before
[1:48:49] the Lord and there's nothing there
[1:48:51] absolutely nothing
[1:48:55] maybe I'm weird but this is what I do
[1:48:57] all the time
[1:48:58] I go before the Lord and just want him
[1:49:01] to do a scan and we're familiar scans in
[1:49:04] this day right CT scans you know all
[1:49:06] kinds of scans and tests and this and
[1:49:08] that that's the way I want the Lord to
[1:49:10] do me
[1:49:12] I just tell him
[1:49:14] search me Lord
[1:49:16] is there anything you see in me that you
[1:49:18] don't like
[1:49:20] is there anything that displeases you is
[1:49:23] there an attitude
[1:49:25] is there a demeanor about me
[1:49:27] is there anything
[1:49:30] that you don't like about me
[1:49:32] please let me know
[1:49:34] please
[1:49:35] I give you my word as your son
[1:49:39] I'll fix it
[1:49:43] is that what y'all want me to live
[1:49:48] well
[1:49:49] would you really want a pastor that when
[1:49:51] you get in real desperate need
[1:49:54] three o'clock in the morning
[1:49:55] and it takes him two days to get back
[1:49:57] with you because he's got so much stuff
[1:49:59] he's got to fix
[1:50:01] I might be dead but then
[1:50:03] I want a man if I want to be a sheep and
[1:50:06] I'm going to fall a Shepherd I want a
[1:50:08] man that lives right does right walks
[1:50:11] right
[1:50:12] and when I need him you don't have to
[1:50:14] have 14 all the calls to get right with
[1:50:15] God himself he stays right
[1:50:19] he stays right
[1:50:22] now what you want
[1:50:28] that's the kind of parents you need to
[1:50:30] be for your children
[1:50:32] and young people that's the type of
[1:50:34] young people you need to be maybe for
[1:50:36] other young people you're going to
[1:50:37] church with they might need you
[1:50:39] because sometimes they'll talk to you
[1:50:40] when they won't talk to me
[1:50:43] they'll talk to you when they won't even
[1:50:44] talk to Mom and Dad
[1:50:46] and if they're talking to you and you're
[1:50:48] kind of cold yourself and you're
[1:50:50] thinking oh my goodness I'm in worse
[1:50:52] shape than they are I can't help them
[1:50:54] we need to stay ready 24 7.
[1:50:58] Christianity is on call every day of the
[1:51:02] week and it ain't just for the pastor or
[1:51:04] brother Donnie I want you to live right
[1:51:06] on Sunday well I want to live right on
[1:51:08] Monday because the Lord may call me on
[1:51:09] Monday
[1:51:10] you don't want to just live right on
[1:51:11] Sunday you want to live right every day
[1:51:13] of the week
[1:51:15] and if God drops a word in my mouth
[1:51:19] what if God will give me a word
[1:51:21] for your son
[1:51:23] a word for one of yours
[1:51:25] you want me in and out and up and down
[1:51:28] and wishy-washy and cold and on fire and
[1:51:30] cold and on fire having attitudes in my
[1:51:32] heart and this and that another you want
[1:51:34] me that way
[1:51:35] you don't
[1:51:37] and that's fair of you
[1:51:39] because if I don't live the right kind
[1:51:41] of life you need to get rid of me
[1:51:43] according to the Bible
[1:51:45] an elder is supposed to be blameless
[1:51:50] which I'm afraid would disqualify some
[1:51:52] of our message preachers because they're
[1:51:54] troublemakers liars deceivers how can a
[1:51:58] man be a pastor and be that
[1:52:01] friends
[1:52:03] as we get closer to the end I think
[1:52:06] every day ought to be checking up time
[1:52:11] I'm under such anticipation for our
[1:52:13] dedication Services aren't you I mean
[1:52:15] Carol was telling that yesterday but I
[1:52:16] told her I said you know what I'm under
[1:52:17] anticipation for tomorrow and Wednesday
[1:52:20] and next Sunday and Wednesday and next
[1:52:23] Sunday
[1:52:30] I don't live from camp meeting to camp
[1:52:32] meeting I'm one of the guys who preaches
[1:52:34] a lot of them
[1:52:35] okay so I live from camp meeting to camp
[1:52:38] meeting I'm talking about like from
[1:52:39] Monday to Tuesday to Wednesday to
[1:52:41] Thursday to Friday to Saturday to Sunday
[1:52:43] you don't know when he's going to call
[1:52:44] you and I don't either we don't want to
[1:52:46] live right today and we'll go out and do
[1:52:48] whatever tomorrow we want to live right
[1:52:49] every day of our life
[1:52:51] [Music]
[1:52:53] but I might not need him brother Donnie
[1:52:55] no but I might need you
[1:52:58] and if I need you
[1:53:01] cannot depend on you
[1:53:04] can I depend on you benaught with God
[1:53:06] that if I pick up the phone and call
[1:53:08] your house and say please pray for me
[1:53:10] please I'm going to this well brother
[1:53:12] Donnie we'll get back with you we'll get
[1:53:14] back with you on that uh there's a few
[1:53:16] things and I've got an unforgiving
[1:53:18] spirit and I've got this and that
[1:53:20] you know what I'm gonna do call somebody
[1:53:22] else
[1:53:23] which is what you ought to do
[1:53:27] let's live right do right
[1:53:31] then God
[1:53:34] Hallelujah
[1:53:36] when God can trust us
[1:53:38] we thought we're something cause he's
[1:53:40] trusted us with Doctrine
[1:53:42] wait till he gives you Ramos
[1:53:50] I've told you I've met the little sister
[1:53:52] in India
[1:53:55] several years ago
[1:53:57] not a preacher of course
[1:53:59] not a leader of a church just a little
[1:54:01] humble simple sister
[1:54:04] in the time of famine
[1:54:07] and God
[1:54:08] performed the miracle the book of Kings
[1:54:10] and the life of this sister
[1:54:14] her meal Barrel
[1:54:15] never run out
[1:54:18] and a bottle of oil never under
[1:54:21] I met her I talked to the Pastors in the
[1:54:23] vicinity them pastors have been there
[1:54:25] and ate with that meal
[1:54:28] and watch the meal be pulled out of the
[1:54:30] bottom of it
[1:54:31] and every drop of the oil go out
[1:54:34] and she'd bake them some bread and then
[1:54:36] go back in the kitchen
[1:54:38] for round two
[1:54:41] a little sister that wasn't a preacher
[1:54:44] I couldn't even pronounce her name I
[1:54:46] don't remember her name now
[1:54:48] but apparently she was pretty important
[1:54:51] to God
[1:54:54] don't get your mind on preachers or this
[1:54:56] great person this great great great
[1:54:58] there's only one great one Among Us
[1:55:01] that's the Lord Jesus
[1:55:06] I've made a lot to be remembered today
[1:55:09] honest and sincerely nowless
[1:55:13] let's approach him
[1:55:15] and while we're standing here praying
[1:55:18] if the Lord places something on your
[1:55:21] heart
[1:55:22] Lord I I've spoken evil against the
[1:55:25] pastor Lord I I've said something
[1:55:27] against my brother my sister my God I
[1:55:29] don't want that in my way
[1:55:31] please help me Lord
[1:55:33] please help me
[1:55:38] heavenly father is we
[1:55:41] stand praying
[1:55:43] as you told us to do
[1:55:47] Lord God we ask that you would
[1:55:50] do a great God scan
[1:55:53] over each of us today
[1:55:56] we're grateful for what medical science
[1:55:57] has been able to do and
[1:55:59] the CT scan the Pet Scan the MRI all
[1:56:03] these things they can do and it shows
[1:56:05] things wrong in our body
[1:56:07] but they don't have one that can go in
[1:56:08] the soul
[1:56:10] but I believe the Divine scan is right
[1:56:13] here this morning
[1:56:16] Lord I only planned on spending a few
[1:56:18] minutes on this but you had other plans
[1:56:22] so I believe you've spoke to us today
[1:56:24] Lord so I pray begin with me Lord Jesus
[1:56:29] don't start with the deacons don't start
[1:56:31] with the trustees the song leaders

[1:56:59] the places I go
[1:57:01] who I fellowship with who I talked to
[1:57:04] May everything about me Lord God
[1:57:08] pass under your skin
[1:57:12] and father I know I can trust you to be
[1:57:14] honest
[1:57:16] and give me a true report
[1:57:18] of what my scan says

[1:57:23] tomorrow I don't think I have to wait
[1:57:25] till next month to schedule an
[1:57:27] appointment
[1:57:28] but I'm asking you now Lord
[1:57:31] if there's anything in my life that
[1:57:33] displeases you
[1:57:35] make it known to me Jesus
[1:57:39] and father I pray when you thoroughly
[1:57:41] scanned me
[1:57:42] may you begin at this pulpit and work
[1:57:45] backwards if you please or however you

[1:58:08] every man every woman every boy every
[1:58:10] girl every preacher

[1:58:46] congregation now

[1:58:50] scan their spirit
[1:58:52] their motives their objectives
[1:58:56] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:58:58] oh Lord we want this word to be
[1:59:02] fulfilled in our lives
[1:59:04] Lord if there's a backslider someone
[1:59:06] that's lost
[1:59:08] dear God that you would put their word
[1:59:10] in our mouths
[1:59:12] may we be in season and on time
[1:59:16] oh Lord
[1:59:18] that we would be able to speak maybe a
[1:59:20] mother maybe a father standing here
[1:59:22] today I know there are I can feel it
[1:59:24] pulling and I know well enough to know
[1:59:25] the parents some of them are concerned
[1:59:28] about their children
[1:59:29] Lord God help them to realize how
[1:59:32] important it is to live every day
[1:59:34] because that word might arrive tomorrow
[1:59:38] whenever you'll put it in their mouth
[1:59:41] we know it was not brother Branham
[1:59:45] that told how to write what to say
[1:59:48] it was her choice
[1:59:50] if she wanted money she could have had
[1:59:53] money
[1:59:54] whatever she wanted
[1:59:56] it would have fell right in her lap
[2:00:00] what an awesome presence that must have
[2:00:02] been that day
[2:00:04] but what did she ask for
[2:00:06] The Souls of her boys
[2:00:09] what a great thing
[2:00:12] now the prophet couldn't say it
[2:00:15] until she said it
[2:00:17] Hallelujah so God was waiting on Hattie
[2:00:23] the prophet was waiting on the Hattie
[2:00:27] her boys
[2:00:29] was waiting on heaven
[2:00:31] a little insignificant woman that the
[2:00:34] world would never know much about
[2:00:37] but almighty God
[2:00:40] Hallelujah
[2:00:41] gave a word
[2:00:43] thank you for that story Lord
[2:00:46] oh Jesus I pray make it real to everyone
[2:00:49] you're today who has children that's not
[2:00:51] where they need to be loved ones that
[2:00:54] are out cold and different
[2:00:57] father in the name of Jesus
[2:01:00] Lord God I think of those that are sick
[2:01:02] today
[2:01:04] I think of those Lord we've got some
[2:01:06] that's sick and then we've got some that
[2:01:07] are desperately sick Lord
[2:01:10] no doubt some of them come and they
[2:01:12] think well baby God will give brother
[2:01:14] Donnie a word maybe brother Daryl will
[2:01:16] say something maybe they're waiting for
[2:01:17] the special meetings
[2:01:20] that may be so
[2:01:22] but Lord it may be you that just drops
[2:01:24] it in their heart
[2:01:26] they're sitting out here in the doctor's
[2:01:28] report
[2:01:29] and all of the sudden they become in
[2:01:32] tune with another voice
[2:01:34] Hallelujah
[2:01:36] that's saying the exact opposite of what
[2:01:38] the doctor is saying
[2:01:41] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:01:45] Lord God make us father
[2:01:47] make us people of such honor and
[2:01:51] character
[2:01:52] that we can reflect your glory we don't
[2:01:55] desire to be anything Lord It's not that
[2:01:57] we're asking that we can be something we
[2:02:00] don't want to be nothing we just want to
[2:02:02] be what you want us to be
[2:02:05] oh Jesus we worship you now father
[2:02:10] can we just raise our hands in the
[2:02:12] presence of the Lord
[2:02:15] how many did God speak to your heart
[2:02:18] here today
[2:02:19] God bless you
[2:02:21] let's just open our hearts to him now
[2:02:24] praise the Lord
[2:02:27] praise the Lord
[2:02:30] praise the Lord
[2:02:34] Hallelujah if you will not doubt
[2:02:37] but believe what you have said
[2:02:40] you shall have
[2:02:42] what you say
[2:02:44] but remember when you stand and praying
[2:02:48] forgive
[2:02:50] can't you see why friends some folks
[2:02:52] will never go on any farther than they
[2:02:54] are because they just can't forgive
[2:02:57] they just cannot get the past out of
[2:02:59] their mind every time they see this
[2:03:01] person or that person or someone
[2:03:03] mentions their name that a one
[2:03:05] forgiveness just raises up in their
[2:03:07] hearts
[2:03:08] oh my is it really worth you holding on
[2:03:12] to
[2:03:14] would you forfeit your son coming back
[2:03:16] to God
[2:03:18] would you forfeit healing for someone
[2:03:20] else
[2:03:21] if there's someone here today that God
[2:03:24] would give you a word
[2:03:26] to speak to my daughter
[2:03:29] I would beg you I would plead with you I
[2:03:32] would get on my knees
[2:03:35] and crawl to you from this Pulpit if
[2:03:37] you're in the back if you're outside I
[2:03:40] would get on my knees and crawl to you
[2:03:42] and beg you
[2:03:44] please let your life be in harmony with
[2:03:47] God
[2:03:48] but you could speak that word for my
[2:03:51] daughter
[2:03:53] wouldn't you do the same
[2:03:57] what about your son your son some of
[2:03:59] your loved ones your husband your wife
[2:04:03] God is calling us to a higher call
[2:04:05] friends
[2:04:07] oh praise the Lord
[2:04:10] we don't want to just dedicate this
[2:04:12] building to God
[2:04:14] we want to dedicate ourselves to God
[2:04:18] oh praise the Lord
[2:04:21] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah

[2:05:19] some of the other services I thought my
[2:05:21] goodness we're so blessed to have people
[2:05:22] like that standing here Among Us other
[2:05:24] people that's been around for years and
[2:05:26] years don't we appreciate them
[2:05:28] that we want them to give up now no we
[2:05:32] need them we need them
[2:05:38] Hallelujah
[2:05:41] can we pray for each other
[2:05:43] would you mind just laid your hand over
[2:05:44] on each other
[2:05:47] Hallelujah
[2:05:50] Lord Jesus we don't know what the needs
[2:05:52] are today
[2:05:55] but father
[2:05:56] we have our hands so you don't want her
[2:05:58] brother
[2:05:59] or our sister
[2:06:01] we're asking you Lord God in the name of
[2:06:04] Jesus
[2:06:06] if we stand here praying today
[2:06:09] and you bring anything to our heart
[2:06:12] help us to fix it
[2:06:15] or Jesus
[2:06:18] we want to be your servants most of all
[2:06:24] as David captured it so many years ago
[2:06:26] Delight thyself also in the Lord
[2:06:31] God may it be said of each of us
[2:06:34] that we Delight ourself in Jesus
[2:06:39] I wonder how many of our people here
[2:06:40] today can honestly say Jesus Christ and
[2:06:43] his word and church and living for him
[2:06:46] and doing what's right is their greatest
[2:06:49] Delight
[2:06:51] it produces such happiness
[2:06:55] here's the key Lord Delight thyself also
[2:06:57] in the Lord
[2:06:58] and he will give Thee the desires
[2:07:01] of that art
[2:07:03] oh Jesus we pray and forgive us today of
[2:07:06] our shortcomings
[2:07:08] forgive us of our failures Lord
[2:07:12] forgive us O Lord any unforgiveness that
[2:07:15] we're holding in our heart
[2:07:17] forgive us Lord if anyone is trespassed
[2:07:20] against us and we're still holding that
[2:07:23] God
[2:07:24] Lord I've got too many too many people
[2:07:28] here today Lord that are looking to you
[2:07:30] not me
[2:07:31] for me to compromise and well if I
[2:07:34] preach that it'll hurt your feelings I'm
[2:07:36] going to tell them the truth if they get
[2:07:37] so aggravated at me because they'll love
[2:07:39] me after a while
[2:07:41] I want to bring on the truth Lord it may
[2:07:43] burn them a little it burns me too but
[2:07:45] Lord we want the truth
[2:07:48] we love you Jesus
[2:07:50] use this father
[2:07:53] not for our Glory not for our honor
[2:07:56] all we know some people in the message
[2:07:58] if they would have stood there before
[2:07:59] the Mount of Olives and they would have
[2:08:02] spoken the Mount of Olives would have
[2:08:04] picked up and been cast into the Sea of
[2:08:06] Galilee
[2:08:07] it wouldn't been that night everybody
[2:08:08] around their Circle would have known it
[2:08:11] they'd have told everybody and their
[2:08:12] brother
[2:08:13] and then we wonder why more don't happen
[2:08:15] Among Us
[2:08:17] I wonder sometimes if we're not bragging
[2:08:19] on herself
[2:08:20] instead of bragging on you
[2:08:24] the way I look at it
[2:08:25] a real servant of God can be just as
[2:08:28] happy when a miracle happens at brother
[2:08:30] Tim's church is when the same Miracle
[2:08:33] happens at our church
[2:08:34] and vice versa we can be just as happy
[2:08:38] when the dead are raised up in Africa as
[2:08:41] we can if it happens in our church
[2:08:43] if we have the right attitude and we can
[2:08:46] say praise God and we can glorify God
[2:08:49] just as much whether it happens to our
[2:08:52] pastor or somebody else's pastor
[2:08:55] because what we want is the glory of God
[2:08:59] help us that we'll never get that way
[2:09:01] Lord
[2:09:02] help us we'll never get to a spot that
[2:09:05] all we testify and testify and testify
[2:09:08] of what God does in our church and then
[2:09:10] we hear what God is doing another church
[2:09:12] of well yeah that's good that's really
[2:09:13] nice I really appreciate it shame on us
[2:09:15] Lord if you're doing it you deserve the
[2:09:18] glory no matter where it happens
[2:09:20] Lord I'm happy about you here here and
[2:09:23] about you healing somebody in the
[2:09:24] Pentecostal church I'll be happy this
[2:09:26] morning Lord if you heal somebody in the
[2:09:28] Baptist Church because that mortal got
[2:09:30] healed in the glory of God was displayed
[2:09:33] it's not bringing glory to us it's not
[2:09:36] bringing honor to us it's bringing glory
[2:09:38] to you Lord Jesus
[2:09:40] search US father
[2:09:42] searches mold to shape us
[2:09:45] oh Hallelujah
[2:09:48] Hallelujah

[2:10:19] Hallelujah

[2:10:42] the baby
[2:10:43] she was up on the balcony and there's a
[2:10:46] sister up there give her a seat she said
[2:10:48] sister I know I know you've got a prayer
[2:10:50] card but I just I'm so burdened for your
[2:10:52] look would you be okay with you if I
[2:10:54] pray for your little child why sure
[2:10:55] honey go right ahead
[2:10:58] you remember whoever the prophet
[2:11:01] that little baby woman come and brought
[2:11:03] her baby up in the prayer life
[2:11:05] and the prophet said your baby he was
[2:11:07] already healed
[2:11:08] that sister right back there up in the
[2:11:10] balcony laid hands on her and got healed
[2:11:14] her right there
[2:11:16] can you imagine how the displeased the
[2:11:19] Lord if that sister would have said
[2:11:20] while who in the world am I there's
[2:11:22] brother Branham here who am I God won't
[2:11:24] hear my prayer God's going to hear
[2:11:26] Brother Brandon's prayer but for some
[2:11:28] reason brother God wanted to use that
[2:11:31] little mother no doubt she had a feeling
[2:11:34] in her heart as a mother but maybe
[2:11:37] brother Branham couldn't have had
[2:11:39] Prophet tells us in one place if she
[2:11:41] hadn't done it God would have rebuked
[2:11:43] her but God linked her with that baby's
[2:11:47] healing God May link you today God May
[2:11:49] link you where you or somebody else with
[2:11:52] somebody else's healer remember the
[2:11:54] prophet said when you lead somebody to
[2:11:56] the Lord you will be identified with
[2:11:59] that name throughout
[2:12:02] eternity
