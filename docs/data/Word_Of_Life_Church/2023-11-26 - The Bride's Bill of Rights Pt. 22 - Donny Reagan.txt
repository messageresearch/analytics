many has a need a request on your heart today I'm not sure if Brother Louie mentioned it or not but brother Jean Littleton is in the hospital and um has some serious things going on in his body i s to want to hold hold our brother up before the Lord today also brother Dan Robbins had to have a a triple bypass and he's doing doing well my doctor said it actually extraordinary so if everything goes well he'll get to come home today so we're thankful for that and we appreciate your contined prayers for him that the Lord will help him and strengthen about two months recovery time they told him so brother Dan's a very active person so not to be able to do much during that time it's going to be very difficult for him so we want to remember him in prayer God will just strengthen him and help him let's just bow our heads together hold your request there in your heart Heavenly Father we come today with Thanksgiving in our hearts gratitude for your blood your mercy your salvation Redemption reconciliation father we thank you so much for all that you've done for all of us no doubt there's so many things that we don't even realize that you've kept us from that you've helped us through I'm sure whenever we get there in eternity and you begin to unveil it all it will be overwhelming to us but just what we know in this life has been tremendous for sure so Lord you saw the hundreds of hands that were uplifted today signifying a need a sickness they're dealing with a problem in their home home maybe a problem on their job Lord we just pray that you'd be mindful of each one Lord I pray for brother Gan little Littleton today that You' help our brother may the spirit of God be with him Lord you see what the doctors have found in his body Lord it doesn't really matter what their scans show and what they say the ultimate and the last decision is yours so we're not brought on the earth just by our parents we're not brought on the Earth by happen stance but we believe by The Sovereign will of God and we will leave the exact same way amen so be mindful of our brother today Lord I pray you see the decisions laying before him and the family would you be with them Father we thank you Lord that brother Dan Robbins was able to have his surgery and come through the surgery well and thank you Lord that he had a heart attack but but it didn't do a major damage and we're so grateful for that they were able to catch it so we pray that you just be with our brother strengthen him Lord be mindful of us today help me Lord Jesus I stand here and probably I'm the most needy one in the building today I need you I need your strength I need you to help me how can I say anything to help these people How can any mortal say anything of Eternal value you to help others the only way is if you come and help me help me to get out of the way speak through me today Father your words of Life In The Name Of The Lord Jesus we ask it and the Saints said amen amen turn with me to James chapter 4 if you would while you're turning there I'd like to make an announcement brother William Smith and Sister Abigail buts from down in Louisiana got engage engaged um this past week and we want to wish them a congratulations on that they've got a tenative wedding date set for um March of 24 I personally hope they don't get the opportunity to get married I hope Jesus comes first amen but we're happy for them and so grateful can we give them a nice hand a talk to the other day and I was making some references I always do whenever I talk to couples that's that's getting engaged want to get married and and I mentioned something that brother Matt Watkins had preached on Sunday and brother Williams said well to be honest I didn't get much out of the service Sunday because I was going to ask her to marry me so I was so nervous that so he must have been pretty tore up so I'm not sure if his words should say no or he scared of her daddy or what it was but he was really tore up so we're we're happy for them let's turn to James chapter 4: 7 if you would today I'd like to speak to you again today on the brides Bill of Rights as a child of God we have so many things that the Lord has purchased for us as his people like a lot of other rights people don't know them always but sometimes it takes um people that are acquainted and equipped to be able to get into the law in the sense of the law of the land in this situation the word to be able to bring out things that are obvious and very plain to see once you do see them uh to help us to see what is more of ours James chapter 4 verse 7 so I'd like to open up today on our right for Satan to flee from us amen our right our God given right that we have to make Satan flee from us amen submit yourselves therefore to God now notice how James puts this together two great things first of all submit the Greek word is hutas it means to be put under or be subject unto to submit oneself to it's a Greek military term to arrange troop divisions in a military fashion under the command of a leader and remember Paul was a very great intellectual man filled with the Holy Ghost of course but he would use military terms he would use terms that would appli to the Roman circus he used a great variety of things to be able to preach the gospel and this was one of them in the non-military use it was a voluntary attitude of giving in a voluntary attitude of giving in cooperating assuming responsibility and carrying a burden so this is the first part submit yourselves therefore to God so I believe both parts apply to us really in the military aspect and also the natural aspect because we too are in an army the army of the Lord so we find our position and there we stay and we submit under that and the real people of God have no problem knowing that God has leaders in the body in the Army and then the other aspect is that we submit to God the key to us being able to resist Satan part two of this verse is obeying part one submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil resist the devil I want you to listen to this carefully and he will flee from you so while you yield to God in all things you don't yield to the devil and anything I'm afraid sometimes we have it in our mind that Satan is this all powerful being that can make us do whatever he wants to that is contrary to God's word he cannot make you do anything if you're filled with the Holy Ghost he cannot it's against God's word for him to be able to make you oh the devil made me do it the devil made me do it that's a lie if you're born again submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil now listen how positive this is and he will not maybe not perhaps he will flee listen this word flee Escape seek safety by flight Amen to escape safely out of danger you mean the devil will do that to us why because you are dangerous you're dangerous I see most of us do you consider yourself as dangerous to hell would you consider yourself as dangerous to the devil this is why we need to know our rights resist the devil and he will everybody say those two words with me he will you believe it he will flee from you not you flee from him but he will flee from you prise the Lord may the Lord have the blessings to his word you may be seated Satan makes his way and secures his triumphs and his victory by Art deceptions cunningness not by strength not because he's greater than you you but by art by deception by being cunning studying the human race studying you and I knowing our weakness knowing what we're vulnerable to so by art by cunning by deception and by threatenings as well Satan is the original terrorist oh my the original terrorist is the devil so what does he try to do try to instill Terror on the children of God and he's very cunning he's very deceptive and he's had a lot a lot of opportunities to do it on the human race so it's not that he really had true courage I find it amazing we take what's going on in Israel and and Gaza and all that and you're familiar with it of course and a lot of these Hamas leaders the top three Hamas leaders one of them's worth is $4 billion the other one is $4 billion the number three man from hamar is worth $3 billion wonder where they got all that money now then poor Palestinians who live under their reign of terror many of them even without war going on they live from one thing to another you understand that Israel sends water sends electricity sends Diesel and sends fuel over to them people and let tens of thousands of them I saw them when I was there tens of thousands of the gazans they would get them work permits to come from Gaza over into Israel and to work and then go back of course you'll never hear that on the news media because I don't want you to know that about Israel but yet it is these rulers and these great guys that live in Cutter and live this ridiculous lifestyle and they're the ones that call a lot of these shots about this and that and what are they professional terrorist so they don't really have to do a lot of stuff all they got to do is threaten to do it our FBI the top of our FBI just week before last said that they have many many hundreds of terrorist on the watch list which have slipped in our Southern border and they're concerned about what they're going to do well we live with a a combatting the greatest terrorist that's ever been ever day of our life and that is the Devil Himself but you understand that a lot of terrorists it's not just so much what they do but it's what they threaten they will do now yesterday they was going to release the second batch of captives that they've been been holding there for so long and then Hamas said that Israel was not doing this and Israel was not doing that and psychologically they were trying to put more Terror on the minds of Israel and also on the minds of those family members so they said well we're going to delay it now what's that all about it's about instilling Terror now you realize every one of us every day that we live under an onslaught of Terror from hell so it's either a terror or going to be able to pay our bills you know CO's going around again this sickness is going on that's going on this is going on and it may never hit us but he tries to terrorize us just by the thing of fear now you understand that the prophet of God Tau us that the reason that we do fear is because the right Temperance of love has never entered into our hearts now love comes like Faith Like patience like Mercy like many of the Great attributes of God it comes in degrees everybody here sitting here today that loves the Lord has a degree of love for God in your heart but everybody here today is not on the same plane when it comes to your degree of love for the Lord You Have Love sure you love him if I'd say how many love the Lord no doubt almost every hand would go up but yet there's some of you that love him with a different degree of temperance than other people sitting there cuz they love him until he goes to saying now I don't want you to do that and I don't want you to say that no more and I don't want you to go here then people say oh I've got a problem with that Lord now look I I don't want you to do that to me well God would tell that to somebody else and they'd say okay you know if that's what you if that's what you want I have no problem with it I'll lay it aside now how could they do that it's because they have a different Temperance or a different degree of love now whenever you look into it that's exactly the way it is with the devil some people they'll never be never be terrorists some people will never murder anybody they'll never absolutely do what a moss has done and what people have done down Through the Ages never and they just kind of live their life and mind their own business and they'll wind up going to hell just like terrorists well why because they refuse God's way of Salvation so their love for the Devil is not quite the same as people who give their their self to God as someone said in my office some couple of years ago at the old church and this individual had come to talk to me because of different things that's going through in their life and they wanted to open up to me about where they were and things they' been through so this individual as they sat there they said brother Donnie I hope I haven't crossed the line and I said well what make what would make you think that and I said they said well some time ago I just got all distraught and I got so upset and I just I I just got tired of serving God and I told the devil Satan you can have my soul from this day forward I'll do whatever you want me to do and since that time I've lived this way I've done this I've done that and I've tried to get back to God and I've tried this and I've tried that and it don't make no difference how much I seem to try it seems like I can never get over it so so do you think brother Donnie I've crossed the line I said well to me I'm so glad that God has kept that Knowledge from me as an individual to know whether you have or you haven't but I'll ask you this one question do you love the Lord Jesus do you want to go to hell do you want to be lost do you want to perish by this time that individual had broken down and was crying almost uncontrollably and said no I do not want to go to hell I do not want to be lost I love him I said then if I was you I would take your own answer and judge the destiny of your soul based upon the way you have responded if you want to be saved to me it proves There's Hope for you or you would have no desire to even want to come back to God but you see what was tormenting this individual the king of terrorism to try to make this person feel like they could never get into I'd say there's people sitting here today that's feel like in your Christian walk with God that you've crossed the boundary line and you can never get back to God I've talked to many many hundreds of them over the years that I've been a minister and yet you find out for most of them they love the Lord but their degree and the intensity of their love has never brought them to a spot to where they could be a real Overcomer now the the phrase here that James writes about is not the person that just gets saved and the person that comes to God and say I don't want to go to hell I don't want to be lost that's a degree of love yes it is but it's not a degree of love that whenever they go to resisting Satan that Satan will flee from them you see the way to be able to meet Satan and all of his tactics is this way and the direction that God gives us and that is resistance now think of the word that James used so the way for us to be able to cause the devil to flee it's not argument now many of us that's the way we fight Satan we argue with him and we argue and argue and argue that is not scriptural that is not the way for the devil to flee from you James does not use the word argue he uses the word resist the way to cause Satan and his demons I'm sure every one of us would be absolutely terrified if we could catch a glimpse of that demonic world that's right here present this morning I feel I'm already here them Devils have already gathered here if we could open our eyes and see and watch how they do you say demons come to church absolutely it's one of their favorite places together because you see when Servants of God are casting out Devils by the preaching of the word or laying hands on the sick and forcing the devil to leave them Devils know that unbel Believers gather there as well and it's one of the best places to be able to get yourself a new house if you're a devil is in church so whenever a preacher cast out devils and that devil leaves that person getting your mind set this way then whenever a man of God forces that devil to leave that devil raises up as it was over the congregation and goes to looking out over the hundreds of people that are there not looking somebody such at the length of your hair or the length of your dress not looking to see whether you've shadeed before you come to church but that devil is looking for you as an individual to see what you're putting out of your soul in the fourth dimension which is either rays of light or rays of darkness and if you are pulsating rays of Darkness out of your soul that devil in the fourth dimension is looking exactly for that and then that will be able to give them a channel by which them demons can go inside of your body I'll tell you when we come to church it ain't a place to play is it it's a place to be serious with God but you see most of the Christendom world that we live in today they live a life that is so shallow of God's love shallow of God's mercy so they lean more toward the grace side of God than falling in love with God the love when you talk about the love of God it's always a one-sided love it's how much God loves them and what God wants to do for them and they're recipients of this great love but they don't want to give much back to him so they wanted to be typical Ley and preaching to where that the preacher doesn't tell them what they've got to do you need to read your Bible you need to pray you need to do good deeds you know all that but they want to say well just tell me what God wants to give me today tell me what God wants to do how much he loves me and what new blessing and great blessings that I'm going to get do those people love God yes I would say an element of them do love him but it's a very shallow degree of love but the more that you go on into his love and those depths open up from the very heart of God and then you're able as you walk into one sphere of love and then he opens up a slight view into another sphere of that same love which you didn't even know was there you thought once you got saved you loved him and actually what you begin to feel was an affection for God which was not an agapo love at all but a FAL love but you see one of the great differences there's many differences between agapo and felo love but one of the great differences is that felio love comes with selfishness so you can love but still you're loving selfishly so many people that's the way they love God that's the way Peter loved the Lord Jesus whenever he said Lord I don't care what anybody else does I'll stand with you I'll not deny you and Jesus said before the crows this many times Peter you're going to deny that you even know me oh no Lord now there ain't no way I love you all my heart and he really did but he loved him with aial love so it was a selfish love so when it come right down to Peter's love for Jesus versus Peter's love for his own safety then Peter chose his own safety is that right now we know this man we saw him he was with Jesus oh no no no no I I I don't even know that man I've never even heard of that man I I never met him before I was never around him now did he love the Lord he did but yet because his human love had this element of selfishness in with it when it come to self-preservation then Peter loved himself more than he led Jesus so whenever Jesus of course in John what is it John 21 whenever they see him and his there he's cooking fish on the side of the water and and then Peter is there with the Lord and the Lord Jesus ask him do you love me said Lord you know I love you well Peter answers him from The Human Side you know I love you do you love me Peter more than Lord you know I love you and then the last the third one is Do You Love Me Lord you know I Agape you now he filio fio and then agle now Peter understands Jesus is calling for a deeper love than what it ever manifested before but actually Peter didn't have the ability to be able to love divinely without the divine nature being in him now Peter was an apostle he had been baptized by Jesus Peter had heard many of the teachings and The Parables of the Lord Jesus but he did not have the divine nature yet because the blood cell had not been broken on the cross and release the divine nature of God himself you can cannot receive that without the divine nature coming into you and somebody said amen so the true way then of meeting the devil is by by absolutely being anointed by the spirit of God through a direct resistance instead of an argument now know make any difference what you think you know how well you can quote the scripture the devil can quote it better than any of us can because he's had a whole lot more years and experience with it so we canot conquer Satan whenever he comes against us in this way to resist as strong as he is now as far as having ability and all the power that he has remember is the perverted power of God because according to the Bible in the Old Testament he was the anointed cherub and God said I have set thee so so God gave Lucifer an anointed position and whenever he fail his name changed his nature changed all of that but he still still kept that position so whenever Daniel is praying and Daniel's asking for God to send him an answer and an angel comes down and wars and wars and wars and Daniel don't understand why and then God sends another Angel down what was it it was an Angelic hierarchy that was still in order even though them Angels had fallen from their original estate so whenever God sent an angel down there was an angel of a higher order that was over the kingdom where Daniel was kept in that time frame and whenever the angel of God came down and War then the prince of that kingdom was Waring and Waring and he could not break through so the angel of God was Hil there Waring and Waring until Michael which was the great Archangel came down and then he broke through and the angel of God then come to Daniel said your prayer Was Heard 21 days ago but I was wrestling I was sent there to wrestle and of course he broke through and brought the angel the angel brought the message of Deliverance to Daniel now I want you to notice that the only way that you and I then will be able to conquer especially in this day is whenever we continue to resist and God is obligated God will never listen to me God will never allow one son or daughter of God to be overcome or conquered by Satan as long is that son or daughter of God is resisting the the Devil with the right Temperance of love it is not possible for God to ever allow you listen to me how could God ever allow the devil to overcome you if his word says he will not be able to if you resist him don't you understand what he does though by his persistence he breaks down our will by his constant temptation of this or that or oppression or depression whatever it is that he's trying to hit you with and he'll hit you day after day he's trying to weaken you he's trying to weaken you you watch as these next releases of the hostages will come is't it amazing that in the two batches that's been released so far not one American not one American now we're supposed to be the most powerful nation in all the world watch if you watch the way terrorists operate you'll get a little bit of insight into the kingdom of hell you know why because they're under the influence of Hell itself now these are people that's not like ordinary Sinners out here remember these people train their little kids they train their little kids with these bands on their head and part of their motto is to kill every Jew that they can find I'm talking about when you're teaching yours about Jesus they're teaching them the value of killing Jews and oh yeah it's not just Jews but it's Christians so some of you Christians that are out here picketing in Chicago and all these different streets them same people if they get in charge you're next in line because they hate you just as much as they do the Christians because they hold a grudge against us because of what happened come on now somebody say Amen to the word because of what happened under the age whenever the Knights of Columbus and the different ones went forth to conquer them they identified them as our brothers they was not our brothers did not pick up swords and fight come on say Amen they hate Christians and they are out to destroy every one of them but typical typical terrorism would be to threaten you even if it's with things that cannot work things that cannot work and not even successful Ukraine has been using it in their war with Russia they have been making cardboard tanks and tanks made out of plywood and yet they have an assembly line of different places and they look like the latest greatest tanks the shans from us and then the ones from Germany the leopard tank from Germany and they make them out of cardboard and plywood they paint them identical they're exact same shape same height the length of the barrel is exactly the same and then Russia will send a missile that cost $300,000 to blow up a $200 plywood tank so what do they do but the way they look at it they're looking through the binoculars they're looking through their drones and it looks identical that's the way the devil wants to do you and I he wants to use a threat that ain't a bit more than cardboard that's all it is he wants to use a threat I'll do this and I'll do that it ain't nothing but cardboard it don't even have an engine it don't have a driver I wish somebody would preach with me this morning it ain't got no power it ain't got no Authority and then we will fight that thing and fight that thing and wear us out and there are whole days P that we've lost when we could have and praising God and thanking God for his mercy and we lost another day of Victory fighting was a paper tiger well come on somebody and if we would have just realized what in the world was going on remember you are fighting this type of an enemy and keep this in mind states that Satan cannot force the human will he cannot force the human will we we've got this mindset somehow that he is so powerful that he can overwhelm us and make us do things that are wrong if you get nothing more out of the service today leave with this one thought he cannot make you do anything young people he cannot make you get on your phone and look at things that you should not look at he can not make you go on YouTube and listen to music that you should not listen to he cannot make you men look at pictures of things you should not look at he does not have the power to make you do it he cannot override your human will but if he can make you think he can then he has assert his Terror over you and then you just cow down and you give into it and then in your mind well the devil made me do it you're believing a lie straight from the pits of hell oh my as a people of God we need to get it in our mind greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world now either that's the truth or it's not the truth but if we believe it is the truth I don't care how many Devils there are 150,000 may show up at your front door in the morning but you can just say right there and say devil you pick the wrong person to fight with you pick the wrong person not today devil and not tomorrow devil cuz I've done heard the word you cannot make me do anything what if you can't make me do it and I don't want to do it then that means I ain't going to do it it don't take a rocket scientist to figure that out notice in 1 Peter chap 5 verse 8 now if there's ever a man that could say these words with feeling it was this man he can say these words but the Dare by experience be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil uh uh uh brother Peter can you tell me how you know this you know how I know it standing out in the courtyard warming His Hands by the wrong fire he wasn't sober he wasn't Vigilant he said your adversary the devil as a roaring line now he's not a line but he's as one so he's a cardboard tank I know friends it's hard for us to imagine I love the way the prophet takes the cover off of him when never he by discernment and a person would walk up on the platform with a tumor then there would be somebody out there somebody over there and he would watch that streak come from this person to a person right back there and he was say now there's another person sitting right there there's a dark streak going between can't you hear him can't you hear him keep them from believing so he could hear in the fourth dimension the language of demons as they were talking keep him from believing keep him from leaving now we said they're here tonight and which way the battle will go will depend upon whether you believe unbelief is gathering and then he would say fath is also Gathering so then demons I've often wondered when they get back down in hell can you imagine this person here that had that cancer devil and then that cancer devil went to screaming out to another person that had a cancer devil and because of that you know if he kept his mouth shut he'd been the only one cast out out but he told on his buddy back there and then both of them got cast out you imagine when they got down in hell and they got into a big fight and a big argument why didn't you keep your mouth shut you know why he done it because he was a coward he was afraid of that angel of God that was standing there and a servant of God that had the authority to cast him out so as long as he could Bluff he's not afraid as long as he's got you bluffed but when it comes to real courage he doesn't have it oh my when it comes to real courage he doesn't have it he's actually afraid of you today if you are filled with the Holy Ghost and you know your rights the devil is terrified of you but if he can Bluff you and convince you you're the weakling you're the one that don't have it you've made mistakes before You' fallen short of the glory of God what you trying to do terrorize you and convince you you are a weakling and he'll wait for your speech to break he'll wait for your determination or your steadfastness and the promise and when he hears it coming out of your lips well maybe I am maybe I can't oh no I've failed to this before he knows right then he's got you not because he had greater power not because he had greater Authority but because he endured and he terrorized you from your position notice what Peter says as a roaring Lon walketh about seeking whom listen what he wants to do to you devour you he does not want to bite you he wants to devour you several years ago Carol and I was in Kenya we got to go to a game Park that was real close there sister Hope's been there many times to Nairobi and there you could see the city actually from where we were but yet they were wild animals zebra and paa all kinds of different animals but a few weeks before we went through there there had been some tourist and whenever we got around to where the Lions was there was a big male lion and several of the females of course and these tourists thought these lions were tame although they had signs do not leave your vehicle do not get out of your vehicle but no doubt they had been too and this and that so they was in a similar Place actually where this event happened whenever we come upon it cuz someone told us where it was so as they pulled up their vehicle and they saw the Lions laying there and severed in the pride and they were just laying there chilling out as would say you know they sleep some of them 20 hours a day so they're quite lazy so the tourists got out of their vehicle and they wanted to get a picture of them with the lies so say right here the lions are right here so they come closer closer closer so they're waving they're smiling they're doing all these things and the Lions raise up kill every one of them Maul them tear their bodies to Pieces someone else comes soon a ve vehicle and finds what's happened now they they were convinced that these lines were okay that's the way sin will try to do you well I I'm good I I've got this under control I'm good I I've got it but you we don't want to just be professed Christians we want to be Overcomers do we not we want to be Overcomers we want to be resistors resistors we want to be the army of the Divine resistance of God we resist lying we resist Pride we resist arrogance we resist lust we resist adultery we resist denominational spirits come on somebody we resist anything and everything that is contrary to the nature of our husband well do I resist it once and then I'm pray forever you all know the answer to that you know yourself that God May deliver you of something and 6 months later a year later five years later that same thing will come back and try to bother you again you see why would he do that because he knows if you don't keep your resistance up he will be able to overcome you again as he did the first time so when will I get relief when you get your body changed it won't happen till now want you notice Peter goes on to say and he uses the same word that James used Peter used the word resist whom resist steadfast in the faith resist steadfast look at the word steadfast here's a good word here for you brothers that like stereo here's you a stereos stereos strong firm immovable strong firm so this is how we resist in the faith steadfastness so when you made the Lord Jesus the Lord of your life and he filled you with the Holy Ghost Colossians says that he delivered you from a power of Darkness now the prophet tells us and whenever he was a young boy that he would have given his heart to God when he was a young man but there was a spirit that hung over him no doubt many of you could Testify the same there was something that like held over you sometimes it can be a a spirit that dominates a family it can be a spirit that dominates a church it can be a spirit that dominates you as an individual and you know you should do how many do I talk to how many I talked the other day to someone that was backing and they said I know where I need to be I know what I need to be doing I know I know I know I know and people people know and it's yet it's like they don't have the power or the will to carry out what they know they should do notice this in Colossians 1:3 who has delivered us from the power of Darkness delivered to draw to on self to rescue as I saw on YouTube of those first group of hostages that was released and I saw them as they were coming from Hamas and going into the Red Cross and whoever it was that was delivering and they were going through and waving and you can see the looks on their faces and the little 9-year-old boy his pictures been all over the Internet he had his ninth ninth birthday while he was under captivity under Hamas the little boy didn't know his mama got killed on October the 7th you understand many of these hostages that are being released they don't even know what's going on they don't know that there's a war in Gaza they don't know what happened on October the 7th they don't know because they've been kept they br real dark sunglasses because they've been in a world of darkness in Gaza Metro the tunnels so they bring them special glasses to be able to to wear because the light is so bright so they're being brought from a world of Darkness back to a world of light so they rust him here to the hospital and there and they evaluate him physically and then they evaluate them psychologically and they say for some of them it will take years years of therapy years of psychoanalysis years of all types of treatment brother Daryl for them to ever be brought back to where they can get back in society of normal people and as I heard these things I thought yeah that's the way it was with us we were held in the devil's tunnels of sin we were in a world of Darkness we didn't know what was right we didn't know what was wrong we didn't know if this was up or this was up we didn't know how nothing but the Lamb of God paid the price that we might be set free and by the angels of God they came and delivered us oh my I saw that little nine-year-old boy on YouTube as he meets his daddy in the hospital no doubt wondering where's Mama but he he meets his father in the hospital and he takes off running to meet his daddy and his daddy reaches down and Scoops him up into his arms and I thought praise me to God that was me one day I got loose out of them tunnels of the devil's darkness and my father met me Hallelujah he met me and scooped me up into his arms Hallelujah to God I'll tell you one thing I never want to go back to the devil's Darkness again do you I never want to go back to that place of SAT but I have to to say my mind also went back and I begin to think about the saints of God when they leave this world and they step across on the other side and they're met at the river brother John by the Saints in their theophany bodies Hallelujah and you imagine as they're grabbed I've seen old women and you know they had one woman 88 years old and another one 82 and you know just people of all different types of of age and that sort of thing and yet here they come and one thing I've noticed over and over and over again in the different hostages that are released is that people are welcoming them and hugging them and pading them and taking their face and I thought yeah that must be what it's like when to say that God moves beyond the curtain of time and the move on the other side they step across the river and then saints of God go to meeting them down there the river and they go to patting them on the back and say he's home she's home he's home she's home you imagine as they rejoice and rejoice because what you say are they hostages yes every one of us sting here today are a hostage to time we are a hostage to this element of this world we are a hostage to old age come on somebody we are a a hostage to germs we are a hostage to the things that's around us but I'm telling you there's a world Amen there is a world that is beyond this one and we're not talking about the Lord Jesus negotiating with the Devil he's just waiting for the last one to come in and their name to be called on that book of life then every one of his children will going to leave in this world one day and we will be met by our loved on we will rejoice we will praise God we will shout in the presence of God for eternity hostages that have been set free hostages that have been [Applause] released and of course you know who I was thinking about I was thinking about my little Erica and when she was released a hostage that 44 year old body we was able to go down to South Carolina before she passed about two weeks not hardly two weeks about two weeks before her liver was so swollen she's look like she's about four months pregnant in so much pain so much suffering but she got set free one of the ministers posted it this week and it was a little video it was a prophet singing beyond the curtain of time somebody had taken that song and put it on there and then had made some sort of a video and it was showing the images and the faces of people and they were kind of blurry they did it that way intentionally you could see these men as they were running and then they had other people coming up dressed in white and they were meeting them and they were hugging I was down in the at the house and whenever I looked at that I just I just had a breakdown I said oh God we're not worried about where she is we just miss her so much and I've been waiting for him week after week to say something to me about her I've been right when I got my composure a little bit he said these words if you could only see her now wow thank you Lord praise God thank you Lord praise God who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son you mean we we have already been translated yep once we get the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our soul we have been translated who have delivered us from the power of darkness and have translated us into the kingdom of his dear son the word power is literally translated Authority so you have been delivered from the power or the authority of darkness when you were a sinner Satan controlled you if he said drink you drank if he said smoke you smoked but I'm afraid friend sometimes we think that power still exists over us it's a cardboard tank it's nothing but a cardboard M16 there's no powerder in it it has no power over you as a child of God but he gets it up and he shakes it in front of you and you're still shaking in your boots by the grace of God we need to walk out of these doors to say today and say no more no more by the help of God will I let the devil and his Cardboard Guns and his cardboard tanks scare me again I'm going to start being a part of the army of resistance I'm going to resist lust I'm going to resist oppression I'm going to resist lying and adultery I'm going to resist sadness I have a right to be happy as a child of [Applause] God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah notice Paul uses this word who has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son look at the meaning of the word translated remove turn away remove from one place to another a change of situation praise God how many's had a change of situation a change of situation notice in Luke 24:49 behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tear you in the city of Jerusalem until you be indued with power from on high endued put on on closed with to sink into closing to sink into dunamis so when the devil looks at you and he hears that voice from within you he don't actually hear you no wonder he's scared he's hearing Jesus what he's looking at is your clothes amen and you're thinking he's looking it's you and that's why he wants to keep you at the Forefront of the battle well you're weak you're afraid you're this you're this well of course that's what he wants to do and he can terrorize you with your own Humanity but what he sees is your clothes he standing there scared to death he's shaking like a leaf but if you go to speaking out of your Humanity he knows he ain't got nothing to fear with the clothes you've got on but if you stand there and say Satan in the name of Jesus you are a liar you are defeated you have overcome me for your lifetime I am sick of it I am sick of being bound by you I'm sick of you robbing me of my joy leave my thinking in the name of Jesus do you understand what he will do he will actually run from you a scared of the power that he sees he's got Terror oh I love to do this I love to bring Terror on the terrorist you know where they found Saddam Hussein y'all know where they found him and a hole on the ground hid like a coward amen the Bible tells us about the devil they shall narrowly n nly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man not the God not the omnipotent one is this the man that made the Nations to tremble who you reckon is going to do that look at verse the verse before it Kings I will lay thee before Kings I will lay that I believe there's some of them Kings right here today and we learn as the army of resistance well brother Donnie ain't you afraid we'll have too much joy and Leo de seea I kind of doubt it I figure there's going to be enough hit us every day it'll be counterbalance this out but it's like we're scared we can be too happy we can have too much joy my church can be too Lively we can enjoy going to the house of God too much I'd like for somebody to show me that in the Bible I don't think this Sunday can be good and then Wednesday has to kind of be off and then maybe the next Sunday might be or might not be I believe we can have a tremendous time every time we come to the house of God it may not be exactly the same but if he shows up it'll still be tremendous notice acts 1 18 ye shall receive dunamus inherit power power residing In A Thing by virtue of its nature or which a person or thing exerts and puts forth all right devil get ready listen what the prophet said in by faith Moses I'm so glad that a man can live so close to God that the devil don't know what to do with him that's right get out get going I talk about Moses and the children of Israel and said Pharaoh got so tired of them being there that Pharaoh said get out can you imagine the devil getting so sick of hearing you resist and so sick of you as a child of God the devil says would you leave me alone would you leave me alone get out of here you're driving be not I wonder if there's 1% of this congregation that's sitting here today believes this how many does glory to God I'm overwhelmed you mean to tell me we believe that we can live so close to God in 2024 almost that when the devil gets up in the morning they say oh no Donnie Reagan didn't die of a heart attack in the night oh no wouldn't it be awful that a preacher around the message dies and they go having his funeral and them Devils down hill said and they said what's so man he said oh that preacher that preacher he was one of the biggest Liars in the message I'll tell you what that man caused more confusion in the message and he was this and that and there I just I hate it I hate it I hope if I go by the way of the Grave y'all have my funeral and the preachers are going to preach it I hope him devils are doing the twostep the three-step and the whatever more step that they do say hallelujah hallelujah he set me free he set me free said what in the world's going on said you hadn't he heard Donnie Reagan's Dead Oh Glory oh my my what I sad thing it'd be to be a child of God and the devil to weep at your funeral sitting over in the corner what's the matter buddy what's the matter had you heard oh sister so and so from word to life she kicked the bucket this morning well I thought you'd be glad no she was one of the biggest gossipers she had the longest tongue in that church I mean she so more Discord she calls more Division and remember divisions of the devil right read your Bible and you'll find out that real good come on somebody oh but don't you Daughters of God want it to be that if you go by the way of the Grave that the devil said go I'm so glad she's gone I'm so glad she's gone it's that way you Brothers want your life to be what about you young people and that to prop a young person that you want to be whether you jump or scream or holler or shout or not and this life but live such a life that when the devil gets one onone with you they're scared to death of [Applause] [Music] you get out get going obeyed God by faith he saw the promise of mud Dober or a mud Dober he taken this way and want the Lord's way the despised f phoh said take all you've got and get out of here I don't even know what to do with you he was so true to God by faith faith will work miracles if you'll stay true to God by faith but you see fear within exaggerates the causes of fear without fear within can exaggerate The Source or the cause of the fear without brother Donnie inflation it's it's awful I know and car went through Wy the other day and got a biscuit and a drink that's $19 I mean that biscuit wasn't that big if you're thinking I got a giant you know 55 gallon drum drink no this is going up and that's going up and this is awful and that's going awful our FBI warning us of terrorism they they all everywhere we look everywhere we look but let's look up this way there ain't no inflation up there there ain't no terrorists up there and you know what if we're not careful we'll surround ourselves with fear if you need to take all them news apps off of your phone and have the message app on there and have a Bible app on there and some good gospel singing that'll lift you voice because let's face the facts there's not a lot of good news except for the [Applause] gospel Hallelujah let me close with this 2 Timothy chap 1: 7 for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind we'll pick it up again next time but let's read this in first John 4:17 herein is our love made perfect how many wants your love to be made perfect now remember it's thus saith the Lord after the prophet was carried beyond the curtain of time thus saith the Lord you'll have to have perfect love to get there so what is perfect love is it a different attribute than the Holy Ghost is it something that's different after we're born again is it something that we get after we get born again and you know we get the spirit of God in our life and then we seek for this something that's outside of the Holy Ghost no no it's not I want you to notice the way that John looks at this now remember this is the disciple of love herein is our love made perfect so it's not like that they're pointing to something outside of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then you'll grow and grow and grow and after you've been in for so many years then you get this thing called perfect love that's actually not what it is it's a deep ER degree of what you already have this morning if you have the Holy Ghost notice the way John says it not separate from the Holy Ghost herein is our love made Tio perfect look at what the word perfect means finish fulfill to make perfect or complete to carry through completely so you can't carry something through if you don't have something to begin with right so what is perfect love it's the completion of that which God deposited in you when the divine nature came in you when you were pulled out of the tunnels of Darkness it grows and it grows and it becomes more mature and more mature until it finally reaches the crescendo of heights remember when he was carried beyond the curtain of time and they told him this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost perfect love which is mature love this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost go ahead look at the rest of this meaning here to accomplish bring to an end add what is yet wanting in order to render a thing full now this is from the strong lexicon if you'd like to click on it when you're doing your studying bring to a close or fulfillment so this is when our love is made perfect in other words it moves from the phase of felo which has all these conditions I love you brother Dave if you love me now you watch how we humans are you watch that we are and if we find out say this brother right here oh brother Donnie I heard that brother man he loves you so much and he just said such great things about you and I said that's a good brother right there but let's just say he said I heard old brother Gary run brother Donnie down I'll tell you brother Gary said this and that and the other he can take this he knows I'm just picking that hey Bo I tell you he said this and what we can do I've always qu always had questions about Brother Gary something wrong wrong with him so what are we basing it on their treatment to us not the walk for God not the not the other things in their life but what somebody said which they might not have said in the first place but what somebody said they felt about us so we judge all people by us so if they think we're a great singer we're a great musician we're a great preacher the well they've got to be great if they think I'm great because I'm great that's expressed you know so I mean they can acknowledge greatness because they just see it that's not perfect love perfect love can love that individual which has become your enemy many times through no fault of your own and actually the prophet said you can love them which would kill you if they had the opportunity and they could get away with it they would kill you but complete love mature Love Will Set say Lord Jesus please help that person please Lord they didn't mean that please Lord I'll tell you friends you ain't when you arrive there you ain't but one step away from the sixth Dimension now we're talking about bride material I don't care how you jump how much you scream and shout show me how you love amen that's good oh my herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in that day now you see the people who come up to the white Throne judgment and they walk Before the Throne of God their degree of love will be reflected by the body they still have and by the look on their face because when they walk before him they will be fearful their own body testifies I'm not standing here in a theophany they never remember they go down through the grave in the tribulation period and they will stand and be judged and the prophet said those Sinners will be judged in the same body you imagine 70y old man he'll be raised and judged in a 70 year old body his own body will be a witness against him they'll walk Before the Throne of God and their life will reflect just like this gigantic screen you lied you stole you looked at this woman and that woman and you thought this and that and the other and there it'll be for everybody to see why the degree of love was so shallow they didn't want to go to hell they didn't they didn't want to be lost now it's reflecting by the record that's before everybody but for those who move into perfect love the fear of the Judgment has all passed they don't even worry about standing Before the Throne of God I was already convinced when my daughter had went anyway but whenever he told me that the other day it just reassured me again whenever he said if you could only see her now CU that lets me know she's just right under the altar where he is and he knows she's in good shape that's right oh don't you want him to say it about you so if I have to preach your funeral or you have to preach M brother the Daryl that the Lord Jesus can ech go back and say if you could only see Johny now if you could only see John now let's bow our heads together love like every other Grace has intensities intensities of degree and depth how many of us could be honest today before ourselves and before God and say Lord I Witness by raising my hands I need a deeper degree of love I raise mine Lord Jesus I love you and I've loved you since a little boy but father I want my love to be of a greater intensity Lord Jesus said I won't just love those that love me but I will love and be able to without resentment or attitude love and pray for those who cause me so much heartache and even pray for those that would kill me if they could and I know of some in the message that would have already done it if they could have got away with it legally but Lord God we desire to be able to walk into that sphere to where perfect love can be so manifested it out of our Lives I've often wondered myself how the prophet must have felt when he was there and he heard that this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost and he said there was no tomorrow they weren't tired they weren't tired of being there they wasn't going anywhere they had just arrived they had arrived praise God praise God all ready by now Lord Erica has done seen no doubt the saints that have passed through the years here at our church and Carol was talking about it against yesterday about sister Brown brother Joel's Mama Hallelujah different ones of the church that has already passed praise the lord we could hear back from them today from that Dimension that'd say maybe to the preachers brother Daryl brother John brother Joel these other preachers This Is What You Preach was the Holy Ghost keep preaching it Brothers keep preaching it it's worth every sleepless night every hardship every trial praise the lord we could hear their voices Echo from Beyond the curtain of time friends wonder what they'd say to you as individuals keep pressing the battle keep pressing the battle it's worth every hardship worth every difficulty keep resisting the devil you are more than conquerors praise the Lord father I pray you would help each of us here today it's evident Lord that we are still in the struggle of time I was delivered years ago from the darkness of the tunnels of an unconverted nature I came out of the tunnel of being unregenerated and walked into a higher sphere of life I come off of that dump and I started feasting on things of the word of God that I never knew existed and it was a great thing what you did for me then but Lord sometime after that you reveal your name to me then you begin to reveal more and more and with each revelation of we will allow it will bring a deeper intensity of love so I'm always afraid of people whose great so-called Revelations makes them cut everybody else off and they seem to have hate for people that don't understand them instead of love I don't understand that kind of Revelation because when the prophet of God went beyond the curtain of time and found out what the Holy Ghost and what perfect love is really all about as I read it this morning he said friends I will never be the same brother brandham again it changed him praise God it changed him oh Jesus I pray you'd touch each man woman boy and girl in this place today those that's streaming those that archived this service as they listen to it may the spirit of God grab a hold to their heart oh Lord many of them love you but it's the intensity it's the degree that needs to be magnified they need to go deeper and deeper and they'll find the more they love you the more they love your word and the more they love your word the more they love your people they want to be around the more they love going to church and it's just it's just a great big vacuum that pulls them in to the very soul of God help us today Lord Jesus we love you Lord would you lay your hand on that person standing by you and let's offer a word of prayer Right Now Praise the Lord praise the Lord Heavenly Father believer to believer we ask you now in the name of Jesus would you help us Lord to love one another more to love the body more Lord I believe that it goes hand in hand the more we love you the more we love our brothers and sisters John goes on to tell us that if a man say that he's a believer that he's walking in the light and hates his brother John says it shows that he's not passed from Death unto life yet the man's still stricken in the tunnel of Darkness but Lord the more we love you the more we love your body and and the more we want to do for them we don't want to bring anything evil on them Lord if there's something about us that wants to hinder the move of God that we don't have perfect love yet Lord Jesus help us as a body as an assembly father to fall in love with you in a greater way than ever before and by doing so we'll fall in love with our brothers and sisters and we will love those that hate us those that would ridicule us and run us down lord then we'll find that theal love is becoming less and less the temperance of it is smaller and smaller and the gape Love is Growing growing growing and as it grows it's becoming more mature I pray you'd help us this morning father's we look at it maybe some have been pondering it for a while wondering about perfect love and thinking about perfect love what it will be help us to see what it is it's the holy ghost that we have growing in a deeper degree than we've ever had before until the selfishness me and I and what's mine it all subsides Lord God and it's loving the way God loves caring the way God cares Hallelujah believing the way God believes oh Jesus we love you today Father Can we just worship Him Saints sing something for us har let's let's just open our hearts now please friends as we get ready to leave here just shortly think about what you've heard don't go to looking for perfect love as being some something out here that you don't have but as what you already have growing and growing and abounding and growing until it reaches its state of maturity imagine it as a little child brother Andrew Glover he sent me a picture of himself and his little boy today and just him with his little baby and my great nephew each little thing and he's getting where he's trying to call Crawl Jude and Wis together last week they they didn't hardly have it together he was kind of up on his hands and up on his knees and he was trying to call you know but he he he one leg he could do it but the other one was kind of dragging back here behind him I thought that's the way we are as children of God but we're trying to do it we try to stabilize oursel but it's like we're growing we before long we be up walking crawling running what would he be doing growing maturing yeah that's way God wants us to be we may get up and fall down and drag a leg and fall and bust our nose but don't you quit you get back up and you keep on until that love that you have this morning matures into one day you will Step Beyond the curtain of time yourself and you say will I be ready you will be ready before you leave this world or you will never get ready hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I believe with all of my heart children of God can be so walking with the Lord Jesus that when death comes they don't have to scream they don't have to honor I've been there when they've done it oh yes I've seen the deaths of sinners like I have saints it could be awful but I'll tell you I've never seen a child of God not one of them when deaths go to moving up and the breath getting shorter and them scared to death and terrified oh God oh God oh God why because they've walked in that walk with God day by day until matured and they could transition simply a transition out of this body into the theophany praise the Lord don't you love him how many wants to love him more sing something for us har fall let's just worship him together now just before you go with all your heart Falling in Love Yes Lord with Jes J [Music] falling in love with Jes Jesus was the best thing I've

and they they took our patches off of our shoulder and gave us shots and they uh marched us to the mesle we wouldn't allowed to speak to nobody and we went by the Armory and they issued Us weapons with bullets and took us out into the field and we stayed there we was going to deploy from the field and I was thinking as brother Donnie was preaching this morning that's exactly what's happened here today you have come by the Armory of God and he has equipped you he's given you some real bullets to use against this ghost Battalion amen I say let's use what God gave us and resist the devil

got up and got ready for school so I sat there in that old chair of mine was looking out the window and watching the sun come up and I was praying for the different ones that had come up for prayer that God would just meet their needs and thinking about the weekend and directly I heard a noise upstairs and it was the girls and they were up and Ally came downstairs into the kitchen or kitchen and den kind of goes together and she looked towards the kitchen she looked back at me look she looked she go daddy's home she ran and jumped up in my lap laid her head up against my shoulder I said did you miss me she said mhm I said was you good while I was going for mama she goes mhm I mhm I'll ask Mama and then she just laid her head on my chest and never said a word because love has its own
