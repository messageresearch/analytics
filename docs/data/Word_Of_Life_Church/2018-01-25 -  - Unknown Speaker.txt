take root and our brother or even attempt to father we again just want to thank you for that and Lord all of these requests there's so many Lord but you know these days it's just so impossible for us

door like they they did our brothers and sisters in China Lord if that government could only see what a benefit real Christians would be to their country Lord they would never stop them they would

leaders over there and let them see they're our brothers and sisters mean them no harm and would never cause them any harm or any destruction whatsoever but they would be a benefit Lord Jesus please

gonna backslide gonna do been back slaves we've got to do being the presence of God presence of the saints of God the team that texted me the other day Tim Mullin and said if you're about the best you can what was that you said we could do Skype or I put something I told a message you'd be surprised what a difference then lick sapphire make we could get on skype and hype and I'd be hyped probably they could do all of that but it wouldn't be the same because I'm not the one who creates it it's all of us together that makes me feel sad tonight that some are still sick and not able to be here we're certainly want to remember them that God will just be mindful of them but I'm glad we could be praise the Lord let's turn to the book of Ephesians if you would tonight I've just been been contacted by some different ones so that the internet was down thinking with Scott him whoever Moore's meant up her trying to get it up and going people were in panic mode because the website was down but hopefully they got it got it up and go on and got it fixed Ephesians chapter 3 verse said and we'd like to speak again tonight about the church I'm glad I'm part of it I want you to listen these passages of Scripture you tell them about wonderful where of I am made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God now this is a real man that's called of God a real gifted man this is what makes a god called preacher not because a man wants to be now because his daddy was his grandpa was I am made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power praise God unto me Who am less than the least of All Saints that's a real preacher this guy that walks around like this forget it in Orono way less than the least of All Saints is this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ praise God and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from listen the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created all things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God so God is going to prove to principalities and powers and demons and hierarchies all that he wants to prove he's going to prove it by the church you mean he didn't prove that when he made the earth when he made the universe and he made billions of stars when he made no he's going to prove that by you well let us all go to Derry claim we've had Church he's gone notice verse 11 according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord then friends what can stop that will have trouble will have heartaches will have difficulty this is beyond us this is beyond the devil this is beyond time God purpose this praise the Lord let's bow our heads together how many like to be remembered - not before God blessing me as well Heavenly Father all Jesus thank you lord thank you that we could come together tonight Lord I know those who really go love to go to church there they're even considered foolish among church people the Lord it's our heart we love it we love hearing your word we love singing with a praying we love fellowshipping with one another with you we just love it thank you Lord that we could come back together tonight we asked first of all that you be mindful of those who'd love to be here and can may you continue to move among the people your Lord and bring healing and rid the folks bodies these symptoms of flu and all the different things that's going on you're still our healer in spite of it all Heavenly Father those that are here present tonight each of us desire to be remembered as well I pray that should help me Lord that I can get out of the way I stand here in a needies spot - now Lord Jesus help me father and I can be able to step aside may the presence of God come anoint this this part in me that Paul described or my portion is so much smaller than his was uh if he was the least Lord what am i what would be even the least among least of the saints I would even smaller than that but redeemed I stand here tonight by the power of God and I wish to speak as the Oracle of God take this service Lord speak to us your precious words as we feed on the unfailing body word of the son of man it's in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it amen god bless you say Jimmy you may be seated what a great thing a great purpose a great plan that the eternal one devised to be able to show such glory manifold wisdom the word manifold means variegated it means that it comes in one Avenue and another and another and another and another and another it takes so many ways to be able to even barely touch the greatness of God that he chose variegated manifold ways by which he would reveal his greatness through the flaws or the weakness of the church instead of choosing perfect angelic beings instead of choosing perfect people if there was such he chose the variegated weakness failures mistakes of the church we would never even consider to do such a thing to us it would be an act of such condescension that we could never think of doing it you know most of us don't like getting our hands dirty when it comes to dealing with people you know people well I'll help her brother and you know people don't don't think I'm kind of bad you know Jesus was the type of individual that he could go out and be able to reach to people that was so bad the scribes and the Pharisees that's one of the things that they had against him because prostitutes sinners they hung around where he was Jesus is willing to get his hands dirty I'm not telling my participating in San now but I'm talking about sometimes people looking at saying why the world would you go over and preach for an old guy there used to be seven Thunder why would you preach for an old guy there used to be this and that and the other well sometimes they need that time a lot of us who know how I'm gonna do that somebody might think I'm seven thunders they hear me preach they'll no lie but we saw afraid we're so afraid our holy holy whatever we think we are that some after all my goodness now come on you PI's hypocrite come on down to the level where the rest of us are but you realize through the weakness that God himself decided to manifold manifest his manifold greatness through the eternal purpose that was purposed in Christ Jesus before the world began and he called it mice Paul termed it that he was going to manifest it through this channel call the church now in the church as we've already looked at there'll be two groups that will be called Church it will be the elect of God the ecclesia of God and then it will be the other group which are just people that attend they go when they want they join themselves together with an association but the real church are the born-again the real church is actually new creatures in Christ Jesus let's look at a second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 17 therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new create creature old things are passed away behold a few things over now men all things are become now they're not just new they become new they come into existence by creation why because you did you come into existence you came to pass as many has believed on him to him to them gave he the power to become that word is to come to pass you were an unregenerate a gene of God but the new birth brought you to pass [Applause] you are a prophecy in gene form you are a prophecy in seed form and the new birth brought you to pass thank you Lord Jesus Oh hallelujah so to be in Christ of course we know that it the notes and means more than just being around the church and while I'm a Christian and I I believe the serpent seed I believe marriage divorce I believe I believe I believe the devil can do the same thing and not be in Christ so to be in Christ is to be a new created Union it is not something that God worked over but it is actually something that is brand new now this is why it's so difficult and many people think they're born again or not but to look at what Paul said that we are a new creature in Christ Jesus so it denotes further more it is not just shaking a preacher's hand come enjoying an allegiance with people that believe this and that and the other but it is something that God alone can do the preacher cannot give you a new birth if brother Branham was here he could not give you under burst now man of God can lead you through the seaching in themselves in the right way to lead you to the process of a new birth but they do not have the power to do it themselves it is as the glory of the branch partakes of the vine and the life that is in the vine is manifested itself in the many many variegated type of branches that would be on a grape vine or whatever more some would be short some of the slender some would be fat some would be twisted someone might be contorted a little more than others but the life of the vine take each one of them all as diverse as they would be and the very life of the vine would be identified in each branch so God saves us God brings us to himself many of your pass is so much different than mine some of your pass is so much different than your wife or your husband or maybe other people that you come to church with and the manifold wisdom of God saves you brought zoom out and is shaping you molding their life getting you ready for a rapture the way he's dealing with you may be totally different than the way he's dealing with a person sitting by him yeah the grace of God in a manifested way will bring each one of us all together can you imagine when we all stand there million-strong and each one of us goes to sharing our testimony all of us are there by the grace of God all of us are there because of what he did at Calvary all of us are there because of unmerited favors that right but yet every one of us will have a little bit different testimony why because he loves to express himself and a variegated manifold away Oh glory to God that by the church by the church now this is the verdurous that so caught me and reading this by the church the manifold wisdom of God now Paul then bringing this over to being a new creature in Christ Jesus notice this he says if any man be in Christ he is a new creature now look at what this word means as a respects form recently made fresh on use unworn new which as recently made is superior to what it succeeds as a respect substance of a new kind unprecedented novel uncommon unheard of man that how in the world can a person be a new creature in Christ Jesus psyllium talk and do the same way they did before they become a Christian there's something wrong somewhere friend now there's absolutely something missing somewhere because the Word of God cannot lie if we are in Christ Jesus we have never been heard of before that new person in you was not made over it wasn't at all 1932 jalopy that was run into a body shop somewhere and they throat some bondo in the rust and they fixed the rubber and they put a little primer on in six months it'll fall out you are not bonded you are brand new new in the Greek Empire a new nature quite different from anything previously existing Oh glory the man is made brand new a man he is actually a little world in himself now look at the way God made whenever the God began to move upon the earth as we looked at it many many times when it come from his pristine condition and verse one - its chaotic condition in verse two of Genesis and we see that God does the same thing to you or not you are the reverse process of Genesis 1:1 and Genesis 1:2 in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth first - of course there are souls without form and void and darkness covered the face of the deep it moves from this pristine condition of Genesis 1:1 - its chaotic condition of Genesis 1:2 and the new bursters exact opposite to you which means the earth is following you back all glory to God Vic God took you you were born into this world not in verse one but you are born in verse soon he was a mess he was a Hulk he was a liar he was a sinner he was lost he was pitiful he was wretched you was blind he was later seen but the Spirit of God moved upon you and God rejuvinated you and brought you from chaos to Christine you are a little world within yourself your atmospheres changed your diets change your destinies changed you're a new creation hey man you're a new creature in Christ Jesus I'm talking about the church now hope if you kind of got away from that little thing when I first started in this several weeks ago that Samuel did not being called the church and this is the church I'm talking about not the church the church amen notice that whenever Paul uses this word actually the word creature that the English word use it's literally creation so you are a new creation so the creates the creature results from the creation itself so we are in Christ Jesus a new creature by the creation of God you with me tonight now these new creatures then must live a new life they of course new headship they switch from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of life notice Titus chapter 3 verse 4 but I do that the kindness and love of God our Savior amen the love of God our Savior toward man appeared not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to His mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost oh praise the Lord by the washing which is Lutron bathing bass they act of bathing this is not water baptism now notice what Paul says the washing not a water but of regeneration this is home so parallels Ephesians when he said the washing of the water with the word but can regeneration new verse so you're actually washed into a new verse man amen reproduction renewal recreation regeneration hence renovation the prompt the product to production rather of a new life consecrated to God a radical change of mind for the better the word often used to denote the restoration of a thing to its Genesis one state pristine its renovation as a renewal or restoration now notice he says according to His mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost renewal renovation complete change for the better Wow so you mean the seed of God got a renewal of the Holy Ghost well now this is your Bible right y'all do believe your Bible defeasance to tell for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus so when was Christ Jesus created we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus you understand this work did not begin in you it did not begin in me it began in Christ Jesus what is the Holy Ghost he'll depositing your part of creation out of his own being this new birth this new creation did not start in you it started in him when he went from the eternal and the farm of the world and to the farm of the logos you don't remember the course not but you was there for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them this my brother sister is the church if he sins for 21 if so be that you have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts and be renewed in the spirit of your mind that ye put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness this is why you can't join this this is why you can have your name on every Church in the tri-cities in their church book if you'd still be lost God's the only one that can do this you can send it Happy Valley you can set a never mr. Church around the world God's the only one that can do this [Applause] wherefore putting away lying what in the world you don't tell this to Christians but apparently appalled out what's a few lying Christians well hallelujah and speak ever man but truth what's his paper for we are members one of another be angry and send off let not the Sun go down upon your house neither give place how about how to run away when I found this yesterday neither give place about this word means room any portion or space marked off I wonder how much space and time we have marked off in our lives our mind for the devil this is the devil's couch this is the devil's recliner this is the devil's space well praise the Lord don't tell me don't fight you that way friends I've been a Christian for a long long time don't tell me the only spoke to me that's very weak as all about a son speaking to you tonight and told me these words if you will compromise I'll let upon you I said forget it forget it it's not in me devil they said you know I make it hard on you you know I'm hard on your than many message preachers thing you know why I said I dunno well I'm proud to be identified as an enemy of hey won't you I'm proud to be identified as an enemy of the devil well boy he has no part of space he has no mind of space in my home no Mike don't space this is an honor of the devil may I say it this one I hope that we as a body of Happy Valley say there's no marked off space in this church for the devil either there ain't no room for him in here praise be to God neither give place make room make sure there's no recliners in your house reserved for the devil when you're riding to work tomorrow in your way to church and the devil jumps in on the other side you say buckle up devil to siloam Tennessee what the devil said there so the devil says Leroy yeah he'll talk to you but you talk to him right he won't hang around you home I said one thing when Jesus he talked to Jesus and Jesus come back and he said it again he come back he can't handle that word boy from the Holy Ghost anointed son or daughter of God he's out of here notice Paul said let him that steal stole still no more but rather let him labor working with his hands must have been some lazy folks yesterday and this amazing now the Ephesian Church was one of the deepest churches in the New Testament they believed an election predestination foreknowledge of God boy you could preach it to them and then scream and holler but they had some line Saints among them and they had some apparently was lazy yes friends this is the pastor case you were wondering offensive visiting minister let him that stole steal no more that rather let him labor working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth this is what a lot of folks look at the church the church is a welfare system boy gimmi gimmi gimmi gimmi gimmi what can you give me what can you do for me well I'm gonna preach with or without you it always looks better on your resume if you say amen to the word let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister grace unto the year saying you imagine speaking these great deep things that he would follow up with simple things like this on an everyday life Wow that's whether that's where the rubber brother meets the road well any man you always just turned out the tire the pads off the piers a while ago on that deep part now come to this stuff and everybody kind of pulled in their shell like a turtle a man notice again Romans chapter 8 verse 12 that for brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh and the church said for if you leave back to the flesh you shall die but if you through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body you mean to tell me this man after Romans seven still believe that the flesh was different from the Holy Ghost in the soul well praise the Lord Paul was still holding on to that yep that's one of the reasons others but if he's thrown notice capital S prit if he through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body you shall live Colossians chapter 3 verse 5 mortify therefore your members ah net crew be dead to make dared to put to death slay worn-out deprived of power destroy the strength of so you mean to tell me a person is a new creature new world new atmosphere new everything and they still got to do this to what the old part cuz your new line in an old bottle we know what Jesus said about that you ran the whole bottle exactly the simplification of the new birth the new wine rims and brain subject the old bottle why because the old bottle is not flexible the old bottle is not born again and we have to constantly mortify the deeds of the body now for those of you feel like your flesh got saved well you just have to look beyond the rest of us sure tonight because we're still kind of the persuasion that our old flesh is our enemy I've heard the Holy Ghost for a long time in my soul it moves on my body and boy it feels good when it comes but as it comes it also goes I'm so glad but it leaves the anointing we sold my flesh don't leave out of my soul it comes it goes on my body because like it does yours but it don't come and go on my soul it comes and when it goes I'll go with it notice mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth what fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence covetousness which is idolatry the potential of these things lays in church people well I thought amens were scarce the first 15 minutes we're getting out where the pastor's wife ain't even batting her eyes she just kind of sent me the friends if this was not possible why would an anointed servant of God write these words my goodness do you understand in your flesh is the ability to commit adultery with another man's wife in your flesh still remains the ability to lie why cuz your flesh a boy oh why don't you come out at all to them why don't you lie why don't you cheat why don't you do all them things you are mortifying the deeds of your body you are keeping that body subject to the word knowing that this body is your enemy in every one of us and I raise the potential to become a coal lukewarm church member I know they don't want to accept it I know they don't like to you're a preacher say it but the inevitable is around us in this message this message will go the cycle of all the rest of the revivals it will go the rest of a cycle and all the rest of those at a live before us in them and the majority of around them will never go on with the word no sir they will become cold they'll become systemic men followers they'll be kingdom builders and kingdom builder followers but the elect will go right on the majority around this move of never going the rapture cycle of life and gas is right on us but it don't have to be on you as an individual except to you sup to me the potential is there for dis church this church to become nothing but cold dead powerless lifeless you second never happened us you're already part of the way there because you've done let down your defense thinking it can't happen to you that's part of your defense Gong rocked area so I'm exempt from that no you're not just the other human being and there's still the laziness about all of us there's a slothfulness about all of us don't you tell me I heard that prophets say yesterday 1965 he said we all need to move up I said yes Lord help me Lord God he said I need to move up you'll need them about let me say for all of us we all need to move up oh my notice for words things sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience now watch how separates the Saints from the children of disobedience why are what's the difference there they are children of disobedience because the disobedient nature from the soul is still ruling them but he said look this is the very fruit that will cause them to be condemned so you don't want to say you're born again and do the same things they do we say why didn't he give us a new verse in the body this is a better way what if you got born again by the gym and he gives you a brand new body and that Nightside sold you say praise God I've never even tempted when and walked in front of these cigarettes wine shoes it don't bother me I'm an inch you just fly from Walmart to Kmart much Muslims going anymore you find from Walmart to target you fly over here said man alive nothing bothers you people call you everything though pablor you your glorified and then Jesus is gonna bring you out of this age and look at you and say blessed are they that overcome come in or the joys of the Lord because you overcome what but he regenerates you from the soul and makes you a new creature and leaves you in prison your feelings bother you complexes bother you what people say bother you what you've even think that people say though they may not say it or even think it but we just think they're doing it bothers us they're getting you angels you excuse me tonight I've got a few humans here that we've not quite reached perfection yet so notice of course since three seven in the woods ye also won't sometime when ye lived in them and I said you remember when you walk that way that was the course of life and you lived the same place because you were on the same plane by nature but he said now your nature has been changed so you don't want to revert back to doing some of the same things you've done before you were born again but now you also put up all these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth worship of Donnie I don't curse I'll tell you what I get mad I hit my finger the other day brother done I don't cuss let me tell you something Fred many folks don't cuss but they taught the devil's language I ain't got no faith I'm not a good Christian I'm not going in the rapture I don't believe brother Donnie loves me I don't believe the church loves me the prophet of God said when you say that ain't got good faith along Chicago 1955 you're talking the devil's language that should never go out of your mouth well there must have been some problem with some Liars at the church at Colossae ly not one to another I know that Happy Valley there's no people like that here but there's people that stream these services all over the world rotten lowdown and sorry I not want to another scene that you have put off the old man with his deeds a man and have put on them the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him this is the church verse 12 put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bowels of mercies well shouldn't that go pretty much unsaid and that shouldn't be a common denominator the common factor among the elect of God that's automatic apparently not apparently we need to be reminded well you know what that tells me if we're told to put on bowels of mercies that means that somehow another you're going to need them kindness kindness in other words you're going to be so tried by people to see whether you will show them kindness or not or revenge I'll get him back I'll tell you one thing I'll get him he done this and this and she done this and this to me I won't speak to her the next time I see her that you're going beneath them they're not going above it climb higher like Jesus did and speak to those who hate you well praise the Lord Mercy's my kindness humbleness of mind instead of thinking that you are the pivotal point of the whole universe you know the scientists many many hundreds of years ago thought that the earth was the center of the universe I imagine if they could peer into the eyes of Hubble into deep space if they wouldn't even have to do that if they could just look up in the open sky and not especially from September through March and they will look up into the belt of Orion come left and look at the seventh brightest star in the sky migaila which is eight hundred light years away that means nothing to you I know five point eight trillion miles is a lot year then they would look up and be able to manage her and see that distance and the light if you look at Adam tonight and see yeah I want you to keep this in mind the light that you are seeing coming from Raquel started 250 years before Christopher Columbus ever found America it's that far from there and if you took off tomorrow in the space shuttle to even make a trip to it it would take you 40,000 years so you see those who feel like they are so important irreplaceable get alive wake up yet the life of Christ let him take that selfish attitude out of you come on Saints Oh humbleness of mine neatness long-suffering praise God preach it Paul forbearing one another and forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any you mean there's some of them deep saints that Colossus was courted with one another If any man have a quarrel against any this is what to do on Facebook even as Christ forgave you ye also so also do you praise be to God and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also you are called in one body and be thankful that the world of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace and your hearts to the Lord my brother's sister I just read to you the true identification of the Church of the Living God [Applause] now through the new burst the believer becomes a per taker of the divine nature and this is what allows him to do these things we just read other people were recently I know I know I know I'm trying I'm trying I'm trying to get this book on how to be a Christian for dummies and I'm trying to figure how to do all this that's why the world is so smothered in their perversion of grace and they've turned it into a disgrace they can't live these Saints that they gotta make up a reason why if you can live it I'll tell you why the new birth doesn't happen in your soul it's quite simple God lives his word whether it lives it in my body or your body or Jesus body or Paul's ball what's this English in chapter 2 verse 20 I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ liveth him and can you imagine Christ Jesus living in a man and him going out smoking marijuana jesus said I forgive you I forgive you I forgive you thank you don't forgive me when the controlling power of the Resurrection that men's body is so out of control he has to shoot up everyday four or five times a day he can't keep his eyes off for women he can't keep away from prostitutes and Christ is in him the Christ that created the universe and he has no more power over this flimsy flesh than to bring it subject to the word I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me and the life the life which I now live in though I live by the faith not in but of the Son of God praise God here's the church friends as we know her the bride I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me don't stop on those last few words and just focus all he loved me he loved me he loved me he gave himself from it you're not saying all he said the proof of his love for you goes deeper than saving you the proof of his love for you sir he died for me it's him living in you him dying for you him saving for you made way for the third phase of him getting in you to live his whole life my brother sister that's what makes hell tremble praise be to God notice cost in chapter 1 verse 27 to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ and brother Adam Carson Paul Carson the possum Christ in the hope of glory this is the church brother Donnie I know you're going buddy but I know I'm going with you well I know my marbles going home brother Dale's a good man how telophase any of the Deacons going out of heavy Valley it'll wind up being brother Dale you need to have confidence out on it but the Dow but in your own experience with God first Peter 1:23 being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth forever for all flesh is as grass and the glory of man is a flower of grass the grass withers and the flower thereof falleth away but the word of the Lord endures forever and this is the word by which the gospel is preached unto you you mean they just don't go around reading Jesus quotes praise be to God a man who could preach better than Jesus you st. matthew mark luke john timothy titus philemon i think any of those brothers could yeah two priests ought to Lord Jesus but the Commission was preach the word those who take brother Branham out of the Apostolic view of the word and say all we should do plays play tapes they're doing worse degradation to this message than the people who have left it because you know what they're doing they're removing brother Branham from the New Testament view and making him an Old Testament prophet where all you would hear in the days of Moses was Moses all you would hear in the days of Jeremiah is Jeremiah yet here in the days of those other men of godless they're men of God in that alone but when you come to the New Testament God sent forth one messenger out from underneath that messenger goes the ministry of others they are placing brother Branham as an Old Testament prophet therefore they make him no mouth think of it they make him where he cannot turn our hearts back to the Apostolic fathers [Applause] praise be to God now the second Peter chapter 1 verse 4 where a bow are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises oma that byesies ye might be partakers of the divine nature are you all ready for this the word divine is the word feels Godhead glory be the guard know why some of you all in chat y'all shall not go still got the folder that by this we are partakers of the Godhead Godhead spoken of the only and true God God's representatives or vice-regent of magistrates and judges praise be to conference think of what the new birth is done we are partakers of the Godhead but this is a particular my daddy's head and my mama and my grandma and my grandpa but the Godhead lives inside this body thank you Lord Jesus notice that you might be partakers of the Godhead nature this is what it is this is the mystery of the church the charity likes of God are partakers of the Godhead nature look at the word nature looses the nature of things the force the force you've seen these license plates energy may the force be with you I agree with edge him so much force you're talking about the force is with me the Godhead force the force laws order of nature the natural branches branches by the operation of nature the sum of innate properties and powers by which one person differs from others the work of the holy ghost in your life is the explicit display of that part of the Godhead God has so many different gifts so many brothers my brother Tim touch my hai can stand and bring the word brother my price and brother Daryl I'm oh my goodness I preach to some of these rather sometimes and I said Anthony their brother Tim you know brother Wayne got done over us these brothers God answered Lord ain't God s alleged to preach but the maps on the back of the Bible well that's a great airing in reality because that means God has so gifted the bride with such wonderful blessed speakers what is it is the in hate rain hair traits of the characteristics of the Godhead exerted in that men's calling gift may I say it's not just limited to preachers it's say every born-again son or daughter of God all thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus what about given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the Godhead nature and this is hell having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust you understand how you escaped the corruption that came into the world through lust well my brother Donnie even the Garden of Eden the serpent lusting after her her lusting after him you were born into that the Prophet tells us finally every man one of the born is saying Obama trained Satan at Eve but you know how you escaped it a new birth Kluwer the godmother down that's the way we escaped the loss of the corruption we were born in we had a new bus and then we were born in the Godhead nature Oh Lord Jesus thank you Father notice James chapter 1 verse 18 you know I don't know if I would've read that scripture not cuz that description might offend some people you know I mean you know how I am I don't want to offend people and stuff and everybody's so delicate in this day that they get their feelings hurt over anything but I went hit and put it my notice I call go and read James chapter 1 verse 18 Oh Oh begat he us with thee well Oh No now I'm gonna feel people if you said if you're offended at this word you need to get saved well I don't understand then they've got nothing to do with that this is God's Word it's infallible not 3/4 his will 1/4 yours 2/3 years one third years 10% him 90% you come on read the word the way it says of his own will begat he us with our word of truth so your regeneration is to be traced solely solely the old creation was by the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the same as in the beginning with God then Genesis 1:1 again in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth how did it come by his own will so how's the second birth the new creation how does it come his older I'm thinking about creating some Christians how many's on my side this is a Democratic Republic now let's all vote for who's on my side and then if you vote with me then you will free me a prom idea the omnipotent God who does all these things and I can do what I want to do trade that little god of yours for a big God for a big God that is so unlimited so did the old creation have to answer to God and God speak to the Earth's and our tourists and Orion and regale and all those trillions of stars had turned said hey look I uh I had this program in my mind I'm thinking about making a bunch of stars but now you know the thing I had on my mind was that each of you would differ in luminosity now what that means is that that rigger a girl will be the seventh brightest star of Venus of a stone stone stone so others that you will be just you know you you won't be so much and you'll just be barely about a there y'all agree with that I know a way to make your God you mean I don't get to be on the belt of Orion no no no no well what about cleanest major no actually you don't get there either when I understand there's some great red giants a time I read no I have had a thought of you have a real small dwarf star I figured Casa de Paul guns in the family so they do you know who he asked [Music] he started speaking and throwing them out there scientists say there are more stars in the heavens then there are human names on earth to call them I had a fifth the other day when I read that because I thought yeah I can agree with that that shows the punitive man's small canary brain there may be not enough names on the earth but there's enough names up in heaven that he threw them all out there by the trillions and called them all by name you're not star 1 star 2 star 3 star 4 he gave him everyone a name that's the greatness of our God oh man is so small and so cheery and so little of his homeworld he spoke believe it or not it's still expanding in the belt of Orion the three stars by which reflect the Pyramids of Giza on the earth mom I'm getting into the weekend what am I doing here but the belt of Orion Braun which reflects itself and the Pyramids of Giza is a nebula a nebula three of their stars are being born while we're here tonight and the universe is still expanding it's still growing and going glory to God surely he didn't take care of us oh by his own will he begat us with the word of truth the instrumentality of truth was not a mere creative act but the projection of God's own divine nature the truths that's who he is why Jesus could say I am the way the truth and the life we are children of truth we love truth notice in Romans 2:15 let me find a place to stop here which show the work of the law written in the heart speaking of the Gentiles their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according what so I ask you did the New Testament Saints have the choice to bypass the teaching of the Apostles and go around them and go straight to Jesus I don't need you Paul I don't need you Peter only none of you I'll get it myself I'll go to Jesus himself not according to them as you did what in the world would embolden this man that he would claim this gospel for the Howard he said my gospel so guess what if you got born again you come through the gospel of these men I don't need that I'm going straight to Jesus Jesus come through these men they get mad pal do whatever you want to do but that's exactly what the word says Romans 16:25 now under him that is a power to establish you according you mean God was establishing New Testament Saints according to the gospel of Paul now listen to me carefully Paul preached what Jesus preached but Jesus didn't preach everything Paul preached because it wasn't time Jesus spoken a little bit about the new verse in Saint John 3 spoke about the Holy Ghost in st. John 14:6 I'm 15 st. John 17 Saints on 16 but whenever it really come to explaining it Paul was given the permission by God to express through Christ the logos and the Rhema that was Jesus in his humanity on the earth could not say why he was going to do it through the church can you imagine the king himself but instead of saying it he said I want to that Peter sit this way and I want to let Paul sit that way and I'm gonna let James set that way and I want to Oliver but they're going to say the same thing but their gifts will be diverse but it'll be me and them Oh glory to God I choose to do it this way and if you're gonna be saved you gotta believe these guys and let me close with this person now to him that is of power to us to stablish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which has kept secret since the world began 2nd Timothy 2:8 remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel or rabito God so could you get to Christ now and fifty five a days sixty to eighty sixty one and this is being said I don't need to go to church I don't need them all apostles after one of the acts of crossing myself a marine nobody not according to what these men talked and this is apostolic [Applause] praise God praise God so you believe Paul preached what Jesus preached Jesus didn't preach everything pomfret because it wasn't time we preached what Luther preached plus Wesley plus Pentecost well praise the Lord you got to keep adding the plus sister God stops and then we all get equal and then we leave Luther Plus Leslie puts the truth the Pentecost then Malachi 4 produces a rapture I'm saying it out loud saying then you'll never go on the rapture because you've left out a bunch of pluses which makes you a - oh my Sofer gonna go in the rapture how will we go our rapture gospel loser didn't preach arrest for extra gospel nor did Wesley nor the Pentecost took Haley easier to bring that to Rebekah then those who are faithfully taught go out from underneath that rapture ministry and say what he said not play what he said but say what he said tell me how can I say what the tapes say if I don't say what the tape said he didn't say play what the tapes play but say what the tapes say the fivefold ministry is not playing stop fast-forward rewind and pause we'll come on church it's apostles prophets evangelists pastors teachers you said well we're preaching tonight they're preaching down a nicaragua brother dare on the brother Linz in those brothers down there hey man people making all the calls I sniper though don't tell me people come into the Lord people accepting the Lord how through the gospel of this day we preach what Paul preached but brother madam also preach things Paul didn't preach I came here in there can you Wow you're understanding that right you see Paul never preached the seven seals wasn't give to it Peter never preached you understand the book of Revelation when it was written Paul was already dead Peter was already dead most of the Apostles are already dead they may not have even ever heard the term seven thunders or seven seals then were already gone with each other it was not their allocation of the word and John solid in vision but couldn't preach it but he said see left to the end time then the days of the voice of the seventh angel and he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished oh praise be to God aren't you glad to be living in this day oh thank you lord raise bottom Thank You Lord if I lived in the first century my name would have been in the New Testament hmm I've been more than New Testament preachers that's right I would have been y'all would have been a church in the first century if y'all live in the first century maybe you lived in cost you lived and let us say you lived in Ephesus but God chose to let you live in this day well you say they no book been written about us there's more books written about us and there was written about them they're not all good but they've all been written about us for sure we are the fulfillment they long to see this time Paul knew it would come Abraham knew it would come Laura took neither her brother mem say yesterday Peter longed to see this day Abraham longed to see this day the Apostles longed to see this day and we see it definitely father think it's in that Lord oh god I'm so grateful that we could be part of the church thank you Lord Jesus at one time I was part of the church movement but Lord the gospel further opens my understanding I loved you even then Lord when you started dealing with me as a child that wound that beckoning of the Holy Ghost I thank you for that the Lord how much more real you are to me today

Spirit of God may we mortify the deeds of the body may we live lives that are true representatives of Jesus Christ Lord may may we get sick and tired of the devil whispering well you can't live rot because your daddy done this and your mama may we shut that devil up may we give him no place in our life and say shut your mouth devil I'm living under the influence of an inherit power of the Godhead I am a partaker of the Godhead nature and the Godhead nature in me gives me power over sin to mortify the deeds and my body and bring them subject to the word a man that if my feelings lie to
