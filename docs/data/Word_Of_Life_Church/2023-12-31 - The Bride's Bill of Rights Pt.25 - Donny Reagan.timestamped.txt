[40:44] today if we ever really learn to know
[40:48] him Beyond just going to church and
[40:52] Beyond picking up a Bible and reading it
[40:54] occasionally and singing a few religious
[40:58] songs but we know him and that his life
[41:03] actually enters into us and we become
[41:05] the expression of eternal
[41:08] life then we will move beyond the
[41:12] knowledge of John
[41:16] 3:16 then we will actually start moving
[41:20] into an understanding of First
[41:25] John
[41:27] 3:16 let's read about it today shall
[41:31] we let's start off with 1 John chapter 4
[41:35] verse 16 this morning greet you in the
[41:38] name of the lord it's a great privilege
[41:40] for us to be together in in the house of
[41:42] God and where we can come together and
[41:45] worship and sing and pray and hear
[41:47] prayer requests and hear testimonies and
[41:50] then the breaking of the bread of life
[41:52] to be able to understand the hour that
[41:54] we're living that we can have a greater
[41:56] your understanding of the Lord for many
[41:59] people going to church it's like they
[42:01] enter into
[42:03] kindergarten and they never really go
[42:05] beyond the preaching of the Cross and
[42:07] the preaching of Heaven and the
[42:09] preaching of
[42:10] hell but whenever I went to school
[42:13] that's been along many years ago of
[42:15] course but whenever I went to school if
[42:18] they would have still been teaching me
[42:19] the same thing in the 10th grade that I
[42:21] learned in the first grade I would
[42:24] figure there's something bad wrong
[42:25] somewhere
[42:27] well if that's just so with education
[42:29] then what about an understanding about
[42:31] God I want to know more than just that
[42:35] he came to the world to save me I know
[42:37] that already okay I'm 67 years old I've
[42:41] been s saved since I was 12 been
[42:44] preaching since I was
[42:45] 18 so I want to know more than that God
[42:50] so loved the world he gave his only
[42:51] begotten son I believe that I've
[42:53] experienced that but I want to know know
[42:56] also more that there's a heaven to gain
[42:58] as we say and a hell to shine I've known
[43:01] that since I was a little bitty guy I
[43:04] want to know more and I want to
[43:07] experience more you see the Greeks
[43:10] whenever they took the word for
[43:12] knowledge they used it in the form of
[43:15] nosis but for the Hebrews whenever they
[43:18] talked about knowledge to them it was
[43:21] more than what you knew up here it was
[43:24] something that you knew by experience so
[43:28] you actually had experienced something
[43:31] and you furthered your knowledge by what
[43:33] you had experienced that's what I
[43:35] believe true Christianity is now notice
[43:38] John 1 John 4:1 16 remember he was
[43:42] referred to as the Apostle of
[43:45] love so he had a depth and a degree of
[43:48] love that uh some of the other Apostles
[43:51] actually never did actually have which
[43:54] lets us know that there will be be
[43:56] people in Christianity Today that can
[43:58] actually experience a greater love than
[44:00] others can notice how John says this and
[44:04] we have
[44:05] known and believed now again he uses the
[44:09] word known as an experience so it's not
[44:13] like that they knew it just up here we
[44:16] have known and believed and the Greek
[44:19] word is soo which is Faith to be able to
[44:22] touch God for what you have needed we
[44:24] have known and believe
[44:26] the love that God hath sent or hath to
[44:31] us God is say it with me God is love God
[44:37] is love and he that dwelleth in love
[44:43] dwelleth in God I want you to notice how
[44:45] that John places this so a person
[44:47] doesn't just experience the love of God
[44:50] God Saves them God pardons them of their
[44:52] sin and then they go right back to the
[44:55] same life that come out out of and start
[44:57] dwelling in the same stuff again but
[45:00] John puts a differentiation between
[45:02] those who just come to a saving
[45:04] knowledge of the Lord and those that
[45:06] move into the sphere of love into the
[45:11] Land of Love he that dwelleth look at
[45:15] the meaning of the word Greek word Mino
[45:18] abide remain continue to remain not to
[45:21] depart to continue to be present not to
[45:25] be become another or different so a
[45:29] person then moves into the land of love
[45:32] which is eternal life he that dwelleth
[45:35] in love dwelleth in God and God in him
[45:42] so God is love and to live in fellowship
[45:45] with him is to live in God he who then
[45:50] is Love full of the love of God will
[45:53] also love his brother he will hate no
[45:59] man he that hateth his brother is in
[46:04] darkness and no light is in him at all
[46:07] how many believes we all need more of
[46:09] the love of
[46:10] God Amen and we'd like to be remembered
[46:13] today as we pray Brother Lou did you
[46:15] mention about brother Bill being in the
[46:17] hospital okay all right we want to
[46:19] remember brother Bill Yan brother Jack
[46:22] and text me this morning said that
[46:23] brother Bill was in the hospital or in
[46:25] the ER vomiting up blood so we certainly
[46:27] want to remember our brother today um if
[46:30] you have a need and request you just
[46:31] hold it in your heart let's just bow our
[46:33] heads in the presence of God Heavenly
[46:36] Father we certainly appreciate your
[46:38] grace to us
[46:40] today I pray Lord that you would open
[46:43] up this realm of
[46:47] fear also the realm of love to
[46:52] us we know that John said he that fearth
[46:56] is not made perfect in
[46:59] love so may we be able to see this realm
[47:03] of fear that we're all born in and see
[47:06] that it
[47:07] is one of
[47:09] captivity one of limitation that will
[47:12] never allow us to be what you want us to
[47:14] be if we don't somehow move out of that
[47:17] land of fear where it controls us every
[47:21] day every night Lord God if we could
[47:24] move from the land of fear today into
[47:26] the land of your all consuming love what
[47:29] people we would
[47:30] become that's our desire we ask you
[47:33] father that you'd be mindful of the sick
[47:35] and needy you see Lord this handkerchief
[47:37] that I have in my hands we know
[47:39] according to the Bible that they took
[47:41] cloths from the body of Paul and people
[47:44] were healed and demons went out of them
[47:46] people were set free I'm certainly not
[47:49] him of course but you're still the same
[47:51] Jesus so I'm going to preach with this
[47:53] Prayer cross today in my pocket for
[47:55] sister Lona you see Lord the sickness
[47:58] and things she's been dealing with Satan
[48:00] in the name of Jesus iure you by the
[48:04] Living God come away from our sister may
[48:08] every attribute of this leave her body
[48:11] in the name of Jesus Christ father May
[48:14] the presence of God come here today may
[48:17] you take charge of this service May
[48:20] every thought be brought into obedience
[48:22] to Christ may not only the master of the
[48:25] wind but may you be the master of this
[48:28] service today help me that I can get out
[48:31] of the way and surrender myself that you
[48:33] can speak through me Father for it's in
[48:36] the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it and
[48:39] the Saints said amen amen God bless you
[48:43] you may be
[48:48] seated we know that God is the
[48:51] highest and the purest form of love
[48:56] and yet there's all different degrees of
[48:59] love it becomes so low it can become
[49:02] filthy ungodly perverted
[49:07] Twisted but the highest form is our
[49:11] father truly he wanted to express what
[49:15] he was and he started doing it in the
[49:17] beginning John goes a little further in
[49:21] the advancement of the beginning than
[49:24] what Moses was allowed to right when God
[49:28] began to express himself and Moses says
[49:31] that God in the beginning created the
[49:33] heavens and the Earth but then we wonder
[49:36] but what was before the beginning it's
[49:40] clear to see from Genesis one that Moses
[49:43] did not catch it before it was the
[49:46] element of time but John was able in
[49:49] John 1:1 in the beginning was the word
[49:51] and the Word was with God and the Word
[49:53] was God and the same as in the beginning
[49:55] with God and he goes on to express to us
[49:58] what the word really was and then verse
[50:00] 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[50:03] Among Us the Old Testament could never
[50:06] be able to convey the real true person
[50:09] of God because the law limited that
[50:11] expression of what God was so what they
[50:15] knew God was was in the manner of Thou
[50:17] shalt and thou shalt not and thou shout
[50:20] and thou shalt not the prophets were the
[50:23] justice of God so God would send them
[50:26] and they'd say thus sayeth the Lord this
[50:28] is going to happen to you and that's
[50:29] going to happen to you if you don't
[50:31] straighten up God's going to send you to
[50:33] Babylon if you don't do this God's going
[50:35] to get you and this is going to happen
[50:37] they could never really be able to
[50:39] understand the love of God the law
[50:42] limited the expression of it Moses saw
[50:45] him one day when he was set in the Cliff
[50:46] of The Rock and God said you cannot see
[50:49] my face no man can see my face and live
[50:52] but there is a place by me and I will
[50:55] set you in the Cliff of The Rock and
[50:57] when I pass by I will move my hand and
[51:00] then you'll be able to see a little bit
[51:02] of my glory but you can't see me so the
[51:06] mystery of God was kept hidden plumb up
[51:10] into the New Testament until one day a
[51:13] baby was born a virgin according to
[51:16] Isaiah would conceive and bring forth a
[51:18] child his name Shall be Called counselor
[51:21] Prince of Peace the Mighty God the
[51:23] Everlasting father and of his government
[51:26] there shall be no end to it people
[51:29] looked at him and thought he looked just
[51:30] like any ordinary baby cried like a baby
[51:33] had to have his diaper changed like
[51:35] another baby he would cry whenever he'd
[51:38] get hungry no doubt as a little boy as
[51:40] he learn how to walk he would fall and
[51:42] bump his head and Mary would run over to
[51:45] him and that would be little Jesus with
[51:47] a little pump knot on his head and she
[51:50] he'd cry and Mary would pick him up hold
[51:53] him in her arms look like a baby baby
[51:56] cried like a 2-year-old looked like a
[51:58] 4-year-old acted like a six-year-old but
[52:02] when he got up to 12 they noticed there
[52:04] was a difference in him they found him
[52:07] in the temple and he was actually
[52:09] expounding on the law and confounding
[52:11] the doctors of the law now many of them
[52:13] men were 50 60 70 80 90 years old they
[52:17] given their entire life studying the
[52:19] Torah of God here was a 12-year-old boy
[52:23] that was asking them questions and
[52:25] answering their questions a 12-year-old
[52:28] boy which had just recently of course
[52:30] come through his bar mitzvah which meant
[52:33] that he was allowed the first time to
[52:35] read the Torah and hold it himself the
[52:38] first time so he read that and he had
[52:40] this understanding they they couldn't
[52:43] understand it at all how could a
[52:44] 12-year-old boy which just now started
[52:47] reading the Torah be able to answer such
[52:50] questions and ask us such questions that
[52:53] we can't even answer ourself now no
[52:55] doubt they were very impressed because
[52:58] they were men of the Mind instead of men
[53:01] of the heart you know we find them two
[53:03] categories the same today there are
[53:05] people of the mind and people of the
[53:08] heart the people of the mind they're the
[53:10] ones that tend to lead toward you know
[53:12] great degrees in college and great
[53:14] understanding about this there's that
[53:16] way the same way in religion that there
[53:18] will be people and they wouldn't dare go
[53:20] to a church unless the pastor of course
[53:23] had a a Bachelor of Arts and maybe a
[53:25] master's degree and a degree in Theology
[53:27] and a degree in this and that and the
[53:29] other and he would stand and he went
[53:30] through preacher school he knew exactly
[53:33] how to fold his hands and make all
[53:34] fingers go together he was so neat and
[53:37] so prim and proper um naturally that
[53:40] don't go along with who we are because
[53:42] we're the acts two type of people and
[53:44] I'm afraid neither Peter James par
[53:46] balamu Andrew none of the rest of the
[53:48] Apostles none of them ever graduated
[53:51] from Bible school but they did graduate
[53:54] from the school of iology and the school
[53:56] of the baptism of the Holy
[53:58] Ghost so that's the kind of church we
[54:01] are now but God wanted to be able to
[54:03] convey something that man had been so
[54:06] far away from since his fall in the
[54:09] Garden of Eden and that was the
[54:11] perception of the depths of the love of
[54:13] God what God was so if God is love what
[54:16] does that mean so God God just lets
[54:20] everybody do whatever they want to do
[54:22] because that's the modern rendition of
[54:24] what people think Love Is Well if you
[54:26] love people you just let them do
[54:27] whatever they want to do and nobody
[54:29] corrects nobody you know because that's
[54:31] the age we're living in in our woke
[54:33] society that you can't say anything that
[54:36] hurts anybody's feelings well the truth
[54:39] of it is if you're going to tell the
[54:40] truth you're going to hurt almost
[54:43] everybody and some people want the truth
[54:45] and most don't but there's no way you're
[54:48] going to be able to really stand with
[54:50] god without hurting somebody's feelings
[54:53] is that right so God wanted people to be
[54:57] able to not only know him by love as far
[54:59] as picking up his word and being able to
[55:01] read it but he wanted them to be able to
[55:04] experience this type of Love Now watch
[55:07] again 1 John 4:17 how that John says
[55:11] herein is our love made perfect I want
[55:14] you to notice how he differentiates this
[55:16] between the love of God and our love so
[55:19] he calls this our love herein is our
[55:23] love made perfect now we looked at the
[55:26] word already the Greek word which is
[55:27] Tios and it does not mean that it is
[55:31] Flawless without fault but it is perfect
[55:34] here is of mature age it's grownup love
[55:38] so it's love to where that it has been
[55:41] brought through tests and trials and
[55:43] storms and things of life now John said
[55:46] herein is our love made perfect so it
[55:49] wasn't given to us whenever we receive
[55:52] the spirit of God our love was not given
[55:55] to us in the perfect format or the
[55:57] complete mature format started out
[56:00] really really green really really
[56:02] immature really incomplete in itself yet
[56:06] it was in seed form so everything that
[56:09] it could ever be laid in the potential
[56:12] so say I would hand you an acorn well it
[56:15] depends on how you look at that acor now
[56:17] if you look at it just in the form that
[56:19] it is you say what could I ever do with
[56:21] that well you could give it to a
[56:23] squirrel and a squirrel could eat it for
[56:25] breakfast and for lunch and that would
[56:27] probably be as far as it would go or you
[56:30] could plant it in the ground and then
[56:31] out of that one would come many many
[56:34] more acrn they would fall to the ground
[56:36] the squirrels would get them bury them
[56:38] they only recall around 60 some per of
[56:40] where they bury them so what God did
[56:42] that by Nature so that they would help
[56:44] plant the forest again so then they will
[56:47] come up out of that will come another
[56:49] out of that will come another and before
[56:51] long you have got a whole big Forest
[56:54] there of either Red Oaks pin oaks White
[56:56] Oaks black Oaks and who was the one who
[56:58] planted them there they come from the
[57:00] sea so it's the same way with our love
[57:03] when we receive the spirit of God we
[57:05] receive this little thing about the size
[57:08] of a button so whenever that button
[57:11] comes inside of us it's so immature it's
[57:14] so green it's so ignorant yetep it's
[57:16] truly the love of God and it starts
[57:19] growing and it gets bigger and bigger
[57:21] and the more that it can grow the more
[57:23] of God can be Express in our life now
[57:26] I'm not sure exactly where you are today
[57:29] maybe some of you about the size of this
[57:31] lid maybe some of you is the size of the
[57:33] bottle some of you may be the size of
[57:35] the pull pit probably some of you think
[57:37] you're as big as the whole wide world I
[57:39] kind of doubt that but maybe that's what
[57:41] you think you are but it continues to
[57:43] grow you say when does it stop it
[57:46] doesn't stop until you're finished in
[57:47] this life and once you get up to that
[57:50] spot then you've reached that place that
[57:52] God and if you'll notice the way God
[57:55] takes his children from the earth some
[57:57] may mature at the age of 40 the work is
[58:00] done he'll pull them from the earth
[58:02] Others May Live to 60 or 65 or even 70
[58:05] it might take them an extra 20 years to
[58:07] be able to come up to what God wants
[58:09] them to be once they R them they mature
[58:12] they could grow no farther if they lived
[58:14] here another 150 years he will he will
[58:17] take them in the Harvest cycle into the
[58:20] sixth Dimension and there they will
[58:23] Embrace their theophany some may go
[58:26] while they're yet in their teens but
[58:27] each one of us will reach our spiritual
[58:29] growth in God in different levels that's
[58:32] what makes the Rapture such an awesome
[58:33] thing because on the earth there will be
[58:36] a group of people all over the entire
[58:39] Earth and they will be maturing along in
[58:42] the same cycle maybe some have been
[58:44] serving God for 80 years and God will
[58:47] deal with them and there may be somebody
[58:48] that just got saved 6 months ago they
[58:51] got filled with the Holy Ghost and
[58:52] they're growing with God they'll come up
[58:54] to to their spot and all of a sudden a
[58:56] sweep will come over the entire Earth
[58:59] and every member of the bride of Christ
[59:01] will be changed just like that all of us
[59:03] will come to that plane of maturity now
[59:06] there may be some that'll be there a
[59:08] month or so before others can you
[59:10] imagine when the high priest leaves his
[59:12] position before the altar of God for
[59:15] however long five minutes a day a week
[59:17] who knows how long it'll be he will
[59:19] change his garments from the order of
[59:22] MDC in the priesthood and the on the
[59:25] earth will be in that state of
[59:27] completion she will not need a mediator
[59:31] Before the Throne of God hasten the day
[59:33] Lord Jesus now remember John being the
[59:37] Apostle of love that he had an insight
[59:40] into the love of God I know you know
[59:42] that God made the body the spiritual
[59:44] mystical body in such a way that there
[59:46] would be preachers there would be
[59:47] deacons trustees singers Housewives all
[59:50] different types of people and it doesn't
[59:52] mean that God loves the preacher anymore
[59:54] more than than he loves you and it
[59:56] doesn't in one sense of the word mean
[59:58] that he has any more of the Holy Ghost
[59:59] than you but God calls him to do a gift
[1:00:02] that's different than your word but yet
[1:00:04] each of us grow in the love of God are
[1:00:06] you still growing brother Donnie I sure
[1:00:08] hope I am I hope I've not reached a spot
[1:00:11] to where I don't grow no more I want to
[1:00:13] know more about him every day of my life
[1:00:15] I took herol this week since the Lord
[1:00:17] taken our daughter just a little over
[1:00:19] two months ago I love the Lord Jesus
[1:00:22] after this experience now more than I've
[1:00:26] ever loved him in my life I trust him
[1:00:29] more now than I ever have in my life now
[1:00:32] I'm so grateful for that because I know
[1:00:35] some people when the Lord will take a
[1:00:36] loved one and they're praying that God
[1:00:39] will spare them and God takes them they
[1:00:41] tend to love the Lord less and they tend
[1:00:44] to trust him less but I'm so glad it
[1:00:46] didn't have that effect on me how many
[1:00:48] knows what I'm talking about now what
[1:00:50] will it do the test and the trials of
[1:00:52] life if we will function and let them go
[1:00:55] in the right way it'll actually make us
[1:00:57] better people it will deepen our love
[1:01:00] now this is one way that you can know
[1:01:02] that your love is getting deeper in God
[1:01:04] because your love for one another will
[1:01:06] also deepen so people who think they're
[1:01:08] more in love with God and yet like
[1:01:11] people less there's something wrong with
[1:01:13] their perception of Love notice John
[1:01:15] said herein is our love made perfect
[1:01:18] that we may have boldness in the day of
[1:01:20] judgment you see what perfect love does
[1:01:23] it paralyzes is dominating fear in your
[1:01:27] life now what Mortal would want to stand
[1:01:29] before almighty God and there's not a
[1:01:31] perfect one here and there's never been
[1:01:33] but only one that ever lived on the
[1:01:35] earth and that was the Lord Jesus but
[1:01:37] yet John makes this love that it will
[1:01:40] give us boldness when we stand Before
[1:01:42] the Throne of God and this is the reason
[1:01:44] why because as he is as he is present
[1:01:49] tense I am because as he is so are we we
[1:01:55] in this world now when we enter into the
[1:01:58] state of perfect love now again it's not
[1:02:00] Flawless or sinless but it is reached it
[1:02:04] has reached its place of Spiritual
[1:02:06] Development that it is complete in
[1:02:10] Christ Jesus and this is what Paul was
[1:02:12] talking about in the book of Colossians
[1:02:15] chapter 2 now remember in its
[1:02:17] development it may take years and years
[1:02:21] but love is like every other grace of
[1:02:23] God remember Remember The Graces of God
[1:02:26] are different than the gifts of God so
[1:02:28] we have tongues interpretation of
[1:02:29] tongues prophecy Word of Wisdom word of
[1:02:31] knowledge Discerning of spirits all of
[1:02:33] that but those are gifts of God but love
[1:02:36] is not necessarily just a gift of God it
[1:02:39] is a Grace of God's nature you see in
[1:02:42] the land of the sixth Dimension nobody
[1:02:44] there has Discerning of spirits there is
[1:02:47] nobody there speaking in tongues there's
[1:02:50] nobody in the sixth Dimension that is
[1:02:52] prophesying there's nobody praying for
[1:02:55] the sick but every one of them are
[1:02:57] living and have moved into the land of
[1:03:01] perfect love so even though we will have
[1:03:04] gifts in this life and we will use those
[1:03:07] gifts for the glory of God gifts are
[1:03:09] only temporal that's why I don't
[1:03:12] understand when people focus so much on
[1:03:15] gifts and they focus and push and push
[1:03:18] and push on gifts and yet they don't
[1:03:20] push on perfect love I I I don't
[1:03:22] understand that one day give will be
[1:03:25] done away withen praise the Lord there
[1:03:28] will be no pray lines in heaven there
[1:03:31] will be no doctors there will be no need
[1:03:32] of that now I want you to notice then so
[1:03:35] in its development love like the other
[1:03:37] Graces of God that it grows and it grows
[1:03:41] and it grows and the measure that God
[1:03:44] has given for each of us to attain to
[1:03:46] the worst thing you can do is try to be
[1:03:48] like this man this woman that man that
[1:03:51] woman and that is your standard don't
[1:03:53] make them your standard you want to go
[1:03:55] to God and say God what is the standard
[1:03:57] for my life now I hope this don't
[1:04:00] confuse you but I want you to listen to
[1:04:02] this the prophet said it this way Jesus
[1:04:04] led by the spirit went up to Samaria and
[1:04:06] sent all of his disciples to get away or
[1:04:09] he said to go get viddles in the city
[1:04:12] that was when John got angry with them
[1:04:15] because they wouldn't sell them anything
[1:04:17] to eat now you remember reading this in
[1:04:19] the Bible and wanted to burn the city up
[1:04:22] now this was John the Beloved disciple
[1:04:24] Le but later he became the disciple of
[1:04:28] love so John started out with this real
[1:04:32] attitude so they went into the city to
[1:04:35] buy some viddles and the people wouldn't
[1:04:36] sell Jesus nothing to eat so John got so
[1:04:40] mad and so upset that he wanted to call
[1:04:43] fire down out of heaven and destroy the
[1:04:46] whole place that's right now probably if
[1:04:49] we would have been there that day we'
[1:04:50] have looked at him and said poor old
[1:04:52] fell there ain't no hope for him are
[1:04:53] they look at that temper Lord have mercy
[1:04:56] he'll never amount to a hill of beans
[1:04:58] with it by that poor old guy little did
[1:05:00] would you and I have known maybe even
[1:05:02] little that John knowed that he would be
[1:05:05] later turned the disciple of Love Now
[1:05:09] the type of love I'm preaching to you
[1:05:11] about this morning is a love that is
[1:05:13] beyond what any human being on this
[1:05:16] Earth can ever produce by themsel God
[1:05:20] sets the standards so high there is no
[1:05:23] theologi
[1:05:24] there is no mother no matter how much
[1:05:26] she loves you there is no father there
[1:05:29] is no human being that can ever attain
[1:05:32] to this high place of love God sets the
[1:05:35] standards so high that it eradicates all
[1:05:38] of our human ability to ever arrive
[1:05:41] there there's only one way we'll ever
[1:05:43] experience it the person of Love through
[1:05:46] the act of John 3:16 will so infill our
[1:05:50] lives with his own presence he makes us
[1:05:54] a permanent resident in the Land of Love
[1:05:57] there we take up our dwelling place and
[1:06:00] there we live for the rest of our life
[1:06:03] we then are transformed from being the
[1:06:06] recipient of just the love of God of
[1:06:09] John 316 till we become the expression
[1:06:12] of First John
[1:06:15] 3:16 amen now I want you to notice again
[1:06:17] that he says and faith is the substance
[1:06:19] a look at Peter when he was walking by
[1:06:22] while he was a mortal born of sinful
[1:06:24] flesh is like I you that's right but the
[1:06:26] people had of a need of a Healer listen
[1:06:29] this carefully they had a need of a
[1:06:32] Healer and God sent Peter to do that
[1:06:35] specific work I want you to notice they
[1:06:38] needed a Healer and God sent Peter to do
[1:06:42] that specific work but he said John was
[1:06:45] love Peter didn't have the love in his
[1:06:50] heart that John
[1:06:53] had
[1:06:54] and yet Peter was a beloved Apostle you
[1:06:57] agree with that Peter was a beloved
[1:06:59] Apostle but remember he was so different
[1:07:02] that
[1:07:03] John isn't it amazing that John was the
[1:07:05] one that leaned over on Jesus bosom and
[1:07:08] John identified himself in the Book of
[1:07:10] John of course as that disciple whom
[1:07:13] Jesus loved and he also identified
[1:07:16] himself as that disciple Who Loved Jesus
[1:07:19] back so there was something special
[1:07:23] between John
[1:07:24] and Jesus it was a spiritual endowment
[1:07:28] from God that none of the rest of the
[1:07:30] Apostles ever
[1:07:32] had now Peter was the significance of
[1:07:36] God expressed in the form of Faith but
[1:07:39] John was the disciple of Love Now notice
[1:07:42] he said Peter didn't have the love in
[1:07:44] his heart that John had John was God's
[1:07:47] oh listen this term John was God's
[1:07:50] agency of
[1:07:52] love
[1:07:54] wow wouldn't that be awesome to be
[1:07:56] identified by God but wonder why most of
[1:08:00] us would prefer Peter's
[1:08:02] walk wonder why even with preachers that
[1:08:06] you find most preachers would rather
[1:08:09] that what they do and the way they're
[1:08:11] used is more visible in front of people
[1:08:16] instead of being behind the
[1:08:19] scenes praise the Lord you ever notice
[1:08:21] it it's the three vocal gifts in the in
[1:08:24] the book of Corinthians that most people
[1:08:26] want tongues interpretation prophecy
[1:08:29] wonder why it's those three vocal gifts
[1:08:32] that most humans want wonder why it's
[1:08:35] the gifts that people want they want
[1:08:38] other people to know that they're gifted
[1:08:40] in that way so they speak in tongues or
[1:08:42] they interpret or they prophesy and they
[1:08:44] want it to be done before the audience
[1:08:47] so people will know they've got that
[1:08:49] gift you know what they're lacking what
[1:08:52] John had love you see real love does not
[1:08:56] have to be catered to real love does not
[1:09:00] have to be in the Limelight as we say
[1:09:03] praise the Lord y'all going to be quiet
[1:09:04] on me this morning aren't you you see
[1:09:06] real love is the type of the love of God
[1:09:09] that whenever you reach its completion
[1:09:11] and maturity in you that if God wants to
[1:09:14] use you for a great work and hardly
[1:09:17] anybody ever even knows you've got it
[1:09:20] real love says Lord praise God if that's
[1:09:22] what you want from me Lord Jesus if
[1:09:25] nobody even knows what I do for you if
[1:09:28] nobody even knows I help this person and
[1:09:30] I do that for that person and that
[1:09:32] person oh I'm glad God's got people like
[1:09:34] that I know it is because there's people
[1:09:36] sitting here that's that way but yet for
[1:09:38] the flesh for most people they would
[1:09:41] rather do something that people would
[1:09:43] look at them and people would know you
[1:09:45] know like Peter oh Hallelujah walk down
[1:09:48] there and say to the man at the gate
[1:09:50] beautiful do you believe yes I believe
[1:09:52] such as I have given I they reach down
[1:09:55] and grab a hold of him by the hand and
[1:09:57] that man go off running and jumping and
[1:09:59] leaping glory to God I went down there
[1:10:02] Hallelujah I went down there and I laid
[1:10:04] hands on him and God healed him brother
[1:10:08] amen but how many wants to be the
[1:10:12] Disciples of
[1:10:14] Love 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
[1:10:20] 910 praise the Lord notice John was
[1:10:23] God's agency of love you see look here
[1:10:25] when you're taking Peter James and John
[1:10:28] hope faith and charity don't you see
[1:10:31] those gifted people them three the hope
[1:10:34] faith and charity Hope was in James he
[1:10:37] was the one who set the church in order
[1:10:40] the one that set the church in order
[1:10:42] Faith was in Peter charity was in John
[1:10:46] so here was God's Representatives on the
[1:10:49] earth now you can imagine then that
[1:10:51] Peter that was an element of about him
[1:10:54] that looked at John and thought I wish I
[1:10:56] had more
[1:10:58] love I wish I had more love anybody ever
[1:11:02] do that besides me to where you look at
[1:11:05] this person say wow I I wish I had more
[1:11:08] I wish I had more like that then there's
[1:11:09] others and it just seem like they've got
[1:11:11] such Faith you know brother B talked
[1:11:14] about Jack Cole and how that Jack Cole
[1:11:16] had that Dynamic face y'all have heard
[1:11:18] of Jack ho right so jackco would have an
[1:11:21] anvil on his pullit whenever would
[1:11:23] preach over to the side sitting on a
[1:11:26] table people come up with glasses people
[1:11:28] come up with different impairments that
[1:11:30] they would come up on a crutch Jack Cole
[1:11:32] would take it I've got a picture of him
[1:11:34] whenever he would take that crutch and
[1:11:36] take that crutch and go break it right
[1:11:39] across his leg so he you either walked
[1:11:41] or crawled back to your seat now we had
[1:11:44] that type of what was termed Bulldog
[1:11:47] face you come up with glasses I hope you
[1:11:50] had a second pair had Faith one cuz he
[1:11:52] had a hammer laying there and he would
[1:11:54] take his hammer and bust your glasses
[1:11:56] all to pieces and a a great percentage
[1:11:59] of the people got their healing and of
[1:12:02] course many of them maintain their
[1:12:04] healing yet that didn't work for
[1:12:06] everybody now there was other people
[1:12:08] that tried to do that and they didn't
[1:12:10] have very good success with it but yet
[1:12:12] God just simply used the man in that
[1:12:15] type of Avenue but it's amazing how
[1:12:17] people will capitalize on that and they
[1:12:19] look at oh that's what I want to do
[1:12:22] that's what I want to do I want people
[1:12:23] to think of me that way it'll never
[1:12:26] happen to you unless God wants you to be
[1:12:28] that way and the worst thing we can do
[1:12:30] is try to impersonate somebody else and
[1:12:33] say well I really like that that's a
[1:12:35] type of person no you don't do that you
[1:12:37] go to God and say God but what do you
[1:12:39] want me to be what do you want me to be
[1:12:42] do you want me to be a person that will
[1:12:44] be there and everybody will look at and
[1:12:47] all that oh if you are God will equip
[1:12:49] you for all of that and God will equip
[1:12:51] you for the downside of all all that
[1:12:54] because there's a great downside that
[1:12:55] comes with it and God will give you the
[1:12:57] ability to be able to do it you know the
[1:12:59] prophet said if a man claims that he's a
[1:13:02] teacher watch how he interprets the word
[1:13:06] it's easy to see that a lot of preachers
[1:13:08] are not really called of God because
[1:13:10] they make the offest mess ever was out
[1:13:12] of the word when they put it together
[1:13:14] it's an absolute mess of what you got so
[1:13:16] their supposed gift being expressed
[1:13:19] shows you they're not what they're
[1:13:21] called to be so it's the same with a man
[1:13:23] that says he has great gift of healing
[1:13:25] and faith and whenever he prays for
[1:13:27] people and nobody gets well well there's
[1:13:29] a problem with that somewhere is that
[1:13:31] right but you imagine then with John
[1:13:34] John may not have had near as many
[1:13:36] miracles but John worked in the realm of
[1:13:40] Love even when he was 90s something
[1:13:42] years old and they would bring him in a
[1:13:44] little CAU type of thing to the church
[1:13:46] at Ephesus and John was too old to
[1:13:48] preach he couldn't get up so he would
[1:13:49] just lay there and they say he just
[1:13:51] raise his hands just lay there and weep
[1:13:54] and say little children love one another
[1:13:56] you imagine being around John it was
[1:13:58] like a Dynamo that just projected from
[1:14:01] his being and this love was just created
[1:14:04] out of the resource of the soul of this
[1:14:07] man and other people would have got
[1:14:09] around said oh my what an awesome thing
[1:14:12] but I wonder how many John's that there
[1:14:14] really were how many were there that
[1:14:17] ever entered into that depth of love but
[1:14:20] yet Peter actually reached a state of
[1:14:23] perfect love but his degree and his
[1:14:27] intensity may have never been what
[1:14:29] John's was and John may have never done
[1:14:32] the Miracles that Peter did and James of
[1:14:35] course we know James you read the little
[1:14:36] book of James it's easy to see that
[1:14:39] James never did really even understand
[1:14:41] in the fullness the Gentile bride James
[1:14:44] was a Jew and James leaned toward the
[1:14:47] Jewish custom and lean toward the Church
[1:14:49] in Jerusalem you never find James going
[1:14:52] to Babylon you you never find James
[1:14:54] going to caposa you never find James
[1:14:56] going out on a great missionary work you
[1:14:58] never find James having the love and his
[1:15:01] heart for the Lord Jesus that John did
[1:15:04] so whenever you and I set our goals of
[1:15:07] what we're going to be for God don't use
[1:15:09] another man another woman another person
[1:15:13] as your standard but go to him who
[1:15:15] brought you on the earth and say what do
[1:15:17] you want me to
[1:15:19] be notice how John now as he goes on in
[1:15:22] verse 18 and he said there is no fear in
[1:15:27] love there is no fear in love but
[1:15:32] perfect love casteth out fear now
[1:15:35] remember John is not talking about all
[1:15:38] fear if you notice him he does not say
[1:15:41] all fear the fear of God should always
[1:15:44] be in our hearts as long as we are
[1:15:47] Immortal the fear of the Lord is the
[1:15:49] beginning of knowledge right Solomon
[1:15:51] said also and the beginning of wisdom
[1:15:53] wisdom so there should always be a
[1:15:56] reverential fear in our heart for God
[1:15:59] hold on tight now there should also be a
[1:16:02] reverential fear of men of God inside of
[1:16:06] our hearts when you lose that then you
[1:16:10] will no longer respect God's offices you
[1:16:13] see those who lose the reverential fear
[1:16:16] that God places for people to have a
[1:16:19] prophet and his word then they take
[1:16:21] those words and they cut them and they
[1:16:23] spice them and they dice them and they
[1:16:25] leave them out you know why they lost
[1:16:27] their fear of that office but God tells
[1:16:30] us in the Old Testament if I sent you a
[1:16:33] prophet and what he says comes to pass
[1:16:35] then you fear that man the love of God
[1:16:39] will not take that type of fear out of
[1:16:42] you now let me just show you a few of
[1:16:44] these whenever it comes to the angels in
[1:16:46] heaven the angels of God we know there's
[1:16:49] categories of angels of course there's
[1:16:50] cherubims seraphim zoons and and the
[1:16:53] sacrifice burners and all that but the
[1:16:55] angels of God that are of God's Eternal
[1:16:58] Essence we know there's some angels that
[1:17:00] were created and they were given the
[1:17:02] choice L like we are in the sense of
[1:17:05] free moral agency and those are the ones
[1:17:07] that was able to fall with Lucifer in
[1:17:09] the beginning but there are angels that
[1:17:12] did not fall because they could not fall
[1:17:14] so they issued out of the Eternal
[1:17:17] essence of God's being not so much
[1:17:19] coming into existence in time but just
[1:17:22] another expression of himself and you
[1:17:24] and I are part of that of course that
[1:17:26] representation so Paul wrote about the
[1:17:29] elect Angels so there are angels that
[1:17:31] are elect and there are angels that are
[1:17:34] created for the purpose to reflect the
[1:17:36] contrast in light and darkness you
[1:17:38] follow what I'm saying now with that
[1:17:41] those angels that are the elect Angels
[1:17:43] do you understand they have never
[1:17:45] experienced fear they don't know what
[1:17:47] fear is like they they don't fear God
[1:17:50] but all they know and all they've EXP
[1:17:53] experienced is love ever since they came
[1:17:56] in to their own individual expression
[1:17:59] none of the elect angels of God have
[1:18:02] ever been afraid so they would walk
[1:18:04] Before the Throne of God and they would
[1:18:06] tremble and shake and be afraid they've
[1:18:08] never experienced that so all they've
[1:18:11] known is walking and living in this
[1:18:14] presence of perfect love so when the
[1:18:16] other Angels non-elect was able to make
[1:18:19] their choice to leave with Lucifer and
[1:18:21] the dragon through his t up there and
[1:18:23] through that third part of the stars and
[1:18:25] when they did that these angels did not
[1:18:28] go neither would they feel the fear
[1:18:31] whenever Jude talks about those angels
[1:18:34] that are kept in prisons of darkness
[1:18:36] when the angels of God in heaven today
[1:18:39] when they hear about that scripture
[1:18:41] being preached those angels Don't become
[1:18:44] afraid you understand the angels of God
[1:18:47] that are elect do not become afraid when
[1:18:50] they know Angels one day will be an
[1:18:52] annihilated because that scripture is
[1:18:55] not talking about them but they don't do
[1:18:58] that out of fear this is the way many
[1:19:00] people serve God they're scared to death
[1:19:03] of God it's like God is looking for an
[1:19:06] excuse to get you and if you make one
[1:19:09] mistake he's waiting for you to mess up
[1:19:11] boy he's going to get you that's not the
[1:19:13] god of the Bible that is not the heart
[1:19:17] of God projected to us in the New
[1:19:18] Testament he loves Humanity he healed
[1:19:22] many people that he knew would never
[1:19:24] serve him but that's the love of God so
[1:19:27] the angels that are in heaven they have
[1:19:29] already experienced what the folks that
[1:19:32] move into the sixth Dimension go to
[1:19:34] experiencing when our loved ones pass
[1:19:36] beyond time and they move into that
[1:19:38] realm and when the prophet went there
[1:19:40] remember what they kept telling him this
[1:19:42] is perfect love this is perfect love but
[1:19:45] he hadn't made the connection before the
[1:19:47] visitation so he preached perfect love
[1:19:50] back in the 50s he called it Divine love
[1:19:52] and he kept calling it Divine love and
[1:19:54] perfect love and then he changed the way
[1:19:56] he would pronounce it a little bit and
[1:19:58] lingered more toward the phraseology of
[1:20:00] perfect love and then whenever he got
[1:20:02] there they told him this is what you
[1:20:04] preached was the Holy Ghost so the Holy
[1:20:07] Ghost then was perfect love well when
[1:20:10] you get the Holy Ghost how do you get it
[1:20:12] do you get it all in one great big
[1:20:14] baptism initially and then whenever you
[1:20:17] get it you're a full grown son now we
[1:20:19] know that God never created Adam as a we
[1:20:23] little baby so whenever God created Adam
[1:20:26] he created him an m n a man so God never
[1:20:31] created a little baby boy and that
[1:20:33] little baby boy was laying there in the
[1:20:35] Garden of Eden kicking and screaming and
[1:20:36] squalling and God had to go down and
[1:20:38] change his diaper and pick him up and
[1:20:40] burp him and you know all that sort of
[1:20:41] thing but God's first Creation in the
[1:20:44] Garden of Eden was a full grown man it
[1:20:48] was a man that was burst into his
[1:20:51] godship when he took the Breath of Life
[1:20:54] remember man was made to be a God In the
[1:20:56] Garden of Eden so whenever Adam took the
[1:20:59] Breath of Life there he stood with his
[1:21:01] toes down in the dirt and he was
[1:21:03] standing there lifeless and then the
[1:21:04] Bible says and God breathed into his
[1:21:07] nostrils the breast of life now when God
[1:21:10] breathed into him the Hebrew word there
[1:21:12] is ruach ruach so God
[1:21:16] breathed God breathed so it was the
[1:21:19] Breath of God the spirit of God the same
[1:21:21] thing that moved upon the face of the
[1:21:23] deep very same Hebrew word so God
[1:21:25] breathed into Adam's nostrils the breath
[1:21:28] of life and he became a living Soul so
[1:21:31] you imagine he's standing there like a
[1:21:33] tree no life his eyes aren't batting
[1:21:35] he's just a hunk of clay so all the senu
[1:21:38] the cells the tissues the blood all that
[1:21:40] is there and then when God breathes into
[1:21:43] him he becomes a living Soul so it goes
[1:21:46] from being a dead dry clay statue to
[1:21:50] becoming a living God just that and God
[1:21:54] breathes into his nostrils the breath of
[1:21:56] life so with that Breath of Life come
[1:21:59] the knowledge of God with that Breath of
[1:22:01] Life come every potential of everything
[1:22:04] he could ever be unlike you and I when
[1:22:06] we receive the Holy Ghost we have to
[1:22:08] start growing and learning growing and
[1:22:11] learning Adam did not have to learn Adam
[1:22:14] did not have to learn how to become a
[1:22:16] God in this Kingdom he did not have to
[1:22:19] learn how to shun this and that and the
[1:22:21] other the image of God was breathed into
[1:22:24] him by the Breath of God you see when a
[1:22:26] person then goes beyond this veil of
[1:22:29] time here and whenever many of our loved
[1:22:31] ones are going and we say oh it's so
[1:22:33] it's so awful they they was they was in
[1:22:35] so much pain and we we know we've been
[1:22:37] there we've seen all of that but don't
[1:22:38] you understand what's happening when
[1:22:40] they're leaving here they're being burst
[1:22:42] into that other world they're being
[1:22:44] burst into that other world and the
[1:22:46] birst Pains of death are coming around
[1:22:49] them and maybe they have to have you
[1:22:51] know something to help ease the the pain
[1:22:52] don't you see what it is to us it's so
[1:22:55] sad and it's so sorrowful but the Bible
[1:22:58] says precious in the sight of the Lord
[1:23:00] is the death of his Saints he's looking
[1:23:03] at it from that other dimension and
[1:23:05] we're saying oh it breaks my heart it
[1:23:07] breaks my heart but he's saying come on
[1:23:09] home daughter of God come on home Son of
[1:23:12] God and they're being burst into that
[1:23:15] other realm and there they lay oh my and
[1:23:18] the life leaves their body in a moment
[1:23:20] in a twinkling of an eye that moved
[1:23:23] Beyond this Mortal Veil and they are
[1:23:25] burst into that body Hallelujah that
[1:23:28] Paul said that in second Corinthians oh
[1:23:30] that there is a house there that was
[1:23:33] prepared for us when before the
[1:23:35] foundation of the world when they are
[1:23:39] burst into that think of it in that
[1:23:41] theophany they know all things what is
[1:23:44] it they are burst into that expression
[1:23:47] of what we bypassed to come here to be
[1:23:49] tempted as a mortal and they move into
[1:23:53] that realm oh I wonder what they're
[1:23:55] doing there today well I can tell you a
[1:23:57] little bit about what they're doing they
[1:23:59] ain't got no watch on their hor because
[1:24:01] they ain't got no place to be they're
[1:24:03] not going anywhere for lunch cuz they
[1:24:05] don't eat they ain't got no beds because
[1:24:08] they don't lay down they ain't got no
[1:24:10] doctor's office cuz they don't get sick
[1:24:13] they ain't got no dentist office because
[1:24:15] they got Eternal teeth Hallelujah they
[1:24:17] ain't got no worries they ain't got no
[1:24:19] troubles they ain't got no handkerchiefs
[1:24:22] used for crying because they don't cry
[1:24:24] they ain't got no tiing off for
[1:24:26] headaches cuz they don't have no
[1:24:28] headaches they ain't got no worries oh I
[1:24:30] wish somebody would preach with me this
[1:24:32] morning they're not down they ain't got
[1:24:34] no pills to have to take when they're
[1:24:36] depressed because they don't have no
[1:24:38] depression they ain't got no uppers and
[1:24:41] no downers and no inners and no outers
[1:24:43] because every moment there is eternal
[1:24:46] happiness Eternal Joy Eternal peace in
[1:24:50] the presence of God hallelujah
[1:24:52] they have entered into that word form
[1:24:57] body so what is it it's a land it's a
[1:25:00] real sphere it's a dimension it's a
[1:25:04] land of perfect
[1:25:09] love perfect
[1:25:14] love you see when the soul becomes into
[1:25:17] this
[1:25:18] realm of perfect
[1:25:20] love then the body be comes subject more
[1:25:23] to the imminent force of that love from
[1:25:27] the
[1:25:28] soul you see Love Will cast out then
[1:25:32] this dominating fear that we're all born
[1:25:36] with why is it that your reflexes are
[1:25:38] made to within 3/4 of a second that if a
[1:25:42] car stops in front of you somebody makes
[1:25:45] up they're going to uh make up their
[1:25:46] mind they're going to stop they hit
[1:25:48] their brakes in 3/4 of a second you will
[1:25:51] react
[1:25:53] now aren't you glad that God knew that
[1:25:56] there would be
[1:25:57] cars aren't you glad God didn't make our
[1:25:59] reaction time two and a half
[1:26:02] minutes most of us wouldn't be here
[1:26:05] today would we we' be pushing up daisies
[1:26:07] somewhere but God made the reaction time
[1:26:10] in the natural now we've got what we
[1:26:12] call fight or flight so whenever we are
[1:26:16] in a situation and we can sense danger
[1:26:19] and harm perfect love does not take that
[1:26:22] out of us it leaves it
[1:26:25] there so whenever you go out of church
[1:26:28] and say well somebody pulled in front of
[1:26:30] me and I laid on the
[1:26:32] horn oh look I must there have perfect
[1:26:35] love no you was trying to protect
[1:26:37] yourself from being hit by that car that
[1:26:39] was going to sideswipe you perfect love
[1:26:42] does not take that out the change of
[1:26:44] your home place will when you move
[1:26:46] beyond the land of cars and trucks
[1:26:49] perfect love though will take out out
[1:26:52] the fear of
[1:26:54] death I've stood by the bedside of many
[1:26:58] Saints I buried over 10 some people
[1:27:00] since I've been here as the pastor of
[1:27:02] this church so I've been I've had to
[1:27:05] experience more than my share of
[1:27:07] death other than me I
[1:27:10] mean I hope I don't have to experience
[1:27:12] it myself I'm kind of hoping I'll be one
[1:27:14] of them that'll be
[1:27:16] alive and
[1:27:18] change and I've seen the death of many
[1:27:21] saints of God
[1:27:22] I've never seen
[1:27:25] one that was
[1:27:28] scared I've seen him young and old I've
[1:27:32] never seen one that was terrified of
[1:27:36] dying why love had reached its
[1:27:41] maturity oh my it doesn't cast out a
[1:27:46] fear that you're 39,000 ft in the
[1:27:51] air you're in a Boeing
[1:27:54] 777 you're going
[1:27:57] 656 miles an hour there's not a cloud in
[1:28:00] the
[1:28:02] sky you've got a Coke in your hand and a
[1:28:05] little cracker or whatever they give you
[1:28:07] on the airplane you know how they've
[1:28:09] reduced everything anymore and you're
[1:28:11] just sitting there smiling like a posle
[1:28:13] you're having the best time in your life
[1:28:15] and all of a sudden that plan
[1:28:20] goes and of course you got perfect
[1:28:22] loveed you just sit there that didn't
[1:28:24] bother me well pray for me cuz it still
[1:28:31] does you see perfect love does not take
[1:28:34] out all fear but the fear that has
[1:28:44] torment some of you are afraid to do
[1:28:47] what God has called you to do because of
[1:28:50] the torment of failure
[1:28:54] the torment of other people before you
[1:28:57] well so and so did this oh they made the
[1:28:59] offest mess ever
[1:29:00] was and that
[1:29:03] allows fear to dominate your life you
[1:29:07] see some fear is necessary for our
[1:29:10] well-being in humanity but it's the
[1:29:13] painful distressing fear that God
[1:29:17] hates to control his
[1:29:20] children some people live under the fear
[1:29:23] of
[1:29:24] poverty maybe they were poor once in
[1:29:26] their life and they're scared to death
[1:29:29] of being
[1:29:31] poor and boy when they go to give a
[1:29:33] dollar in the offering you can tell
[1:29:35] which one they give cuz every George
[1:29:38] Washington is baldheaded as a
[1:29:40] pumpkin they pull his hair Plum off the
[1:29:44] paper the fear of
[1:29:47] loss the fear of sickness the fear of
[1:29:51] bement
[1:29:52] you see when God will take a person from
[1:29:55] us and we look at oh Lord oh no no
[1:29:59] several people are told me oh brother
[1:30:00] Donnie the Lord took sister Erica well
[1:30:03] well he take her he could take anybody
[1:30:06] duh you mean you just found that out
[1:30:09] well brother Donnie could take you
[1:30:10] that's right he certainly could but I
[1:30:13] live every day I'm ready every hour if
[1:30:15] he wants to Here I Am Lord come and get
[1:30:17] me God don't want us to live underneath
[1:30:20] that type of fear somebody
[1:30:23] said God don't want us to live under the
[1:30:26] fear of sickness I know that Old Co
[1:30:28] devil is trying to raise its head back
[1:30:30] up Among Us and people are terrified of
[1:30:32] Co I think we need to look at devil to
[1:30:34] their face and say get on back to Hell
[1:30:36] devil you ain't controll in my
[1:30:40] life turn with me to St John
[1:30:43] 13:34 now watch here's the very heart of
[1:30:46] God not the law of God not the justice
[1:30:49] of God and Jesus was not just a prophet
[1:30:52] of God but he was God the prophet which
[1:30:55] is a great difference so here he comes
[1:30:58] with a New Covenant and a new testament
[1:31:02] but he also adds a new
[1:31:05] commandment now Moses gave 10 but
[1:31:08] there's going to be many more in the New
[1:31:09] Testament notice in St John 13:34 a new
[1:31:15] commandment I give unto you that you
[1:31:18] love one another now don't stop there
[1:31:22] right come on now this is the way we're
[1:31:24] supposed to love one another and this is
[1:31:26] the Commandment of the Lord Jesus as
[1:31:30] I have loved
[1:31:34] you so the new commandment in the new
[1:31:37] covant
[1:31:38] is that we are to love one another as
[1:31:42] Jesus loves
[1:31:48] us now how does he do that
[1:31:55] unconditionally do you want Jesus to
[1:31:57] love you when you're out of
[1:31:59] sorts you want Jesus to love you when
[1:32:02] you're not deserving of Love You Want
[1:32:05] Jesus to love you even when you mess
[1:32:07] up well that's the new commandment that
[1:32:10] we're supposed to love our brothers and
[1:32:13] sisters the same
[1:32:16] way oh my fix I I guess it's fixing to
[1:32:18] get really quiet on me ain't it a new
[1:32:21] commandment I given to you that you love
[1:32:23] one another as I have loved you that ye
[1:32:27] also love one another I want you to
[1:32:30] notice this is actually going to be a
[1:32:34] badge of
[1:32:38] discipleship this is going to be the
[1:32:41] true the true
[1:32:44] identification of Jesus
[1:32:47] disciples the true identification which
[1:32:51] can never be
[1:32:55] impersonated it's the only thing in the
[1:32:59] Bible tongues can be impersonated
[1:33:03] prophecy can be impersonated jumping
[1:33:05] shouting
[1:33:08] running but this can never be
[1:33:12] impersonated it's the true
[1:33:15] Badge of
[1:33:19] discipleship how many wants it
[1:33:22] amen this command now notice a new
[1:33:25] commandment I given to you that you love
[1:33:27] one another as I have loved you so this
[1:33:29] that he's about to leave with his church
[1:33:32] is to be the badge of discipleship that
[1:33:35] might be distinguished above every other
[1:33:38] thing you see false anointed ones will
[1:33:41] stand up according to Matthew chapter 24
[1:33:43] and they'll stand before the Lord Jesus
[1:33:45] and say I cast out devils in your name I
[1:33:48] heal the sick in your name I raise the
[1:33:50] dead in your name I proph propes do you
[1:33:52] realize one of the greatest Old
[1:33:54] Testament prophecies speaking about the
[1:33:57] star that would rise out of Jacob and a
[1:34:01] scepter that would come Numbers chapter
[1:34:03] 24 do you realize one of the greatest
[1:34:06] prophecies giving of the coming of the
[1:34:08] Lord Jesus was given by a false
[1:34:13] prophet
[1:34:15] balum that man gave such a prophecy it
[1:34:19] was absolutely awesome
[1:34:23] astounding and he will stand before the
[1:34:25] Lord God that day and be judged and
[1:34:28] turned into Eternal
[1:34:35] separation prophecy is not a badge a
[1:34:39] true Badge of
[1:34:42] discipleship
[1:34:45] tongues well
[1:34:47] Glory you see this had never been given
[1:34:51] before
[1:34:52] before this had never been said before
[1:34:56] it had never been known like this that
[1:34:59] it would be a distinguishable one
[1:35:02] distinguishable
[1:35:04] attribute that would separate his elect
[1:35:08] from all other people on the
[1:35:11] Earth cuz many people can dress like a
[1:35:14] Christian should
[1:35:16] dress but they take them clothes off and
[1:35:18] they could put on other clothes and take
[1:35:20] on another identity
[1:35:22] so they could sing about the cross and
[1:35:25] say I love the Lord I Want to Go to
[1:35:27] Heaven that's not the distinguishable
[1:35:30] attribute of wanting to go to heaven but
[1:35:34] it's loving like he
[1:35:37] loves which can only be done when he
[1:35:41] himself gets in our
[1:35:44] soul everybody understand this is
[1:35:47] impossible for me this is impossible for
[1:35:50] you so let's just settle this right now
[1:35:52] we cannot ever accomplish this on our
[1:35:56] own there's only one way him be inside
[1:36:01] of us loving when we
[1:36:04] can't forgiving when we can't oh praise
[1:36:09] be to
[1:36:10] God now notice he says as I have loved
[1:36:15] you let's read again if you would in St
[1:36:17] John
[1:36:19] 15:12 this is my commandment that you
[1:36:23] love one another notice again Jesus says
[1:36:26] the same thing as I have loved you now
[1:36:30] he knows Peter's going to deny him he
[1:36:32] knows Peter's going to turn into a
[1:36:34] cussing preacher he knows that all the
[1:36:36] rest of them is going to deny them and
[1:36:38] walk away but Jesus loved them to the
[1:36:41] end the Bible says so he knew what they
[1:36:45] were going to do they was going to turn
[1:36:47] away from him they was going to leave
[1:36:49] him to die alone and yet he they love
[1:36:52] them the
[1:36:54] same boy this is hard for us isn't
[1:36:58] it can we love people that talk about us
[1:37:02] and run us
[1:37:04] down and cause all types of injury to us
[1:37:11] personally amen 1 two 3 4 boy them hands
[1:37:15] are getting fewer and
[1:37:18] fewer notice this is my Commandment that
[1:37:22] you love one another as I have loved you
[1:37:24] verse 17 these things I command now
[1:37:27] remember these are not
[1:37:30] options these are
[1:37:33] commands now we're talking about
[1:37:36] rapturing
[1:37:40] material these things I command you that
[1:37:43] you love one another now as I said as my
[1:37:46] opening remarks that so many quote John
[1:37:50] 36
[1:37:53] 16 but don't raise your hands but I
[1:37:55] wonder how many of you even know by
[1:37:57] memory what first John 3:16 even
[1:38:05] says wonder
[1:38:07] why wonder why we know John 3:16 but
[1:38:11] we're not near as familiar with first
[1:38:14] John
[1:38:15] 3:16 well in one way it's quite simple
[1:38:18] John 3:16 is what he did 1 John 3:16 is
[1:38:23] what he does in
[1:38:25] us so it puts us in under the gun shall
[1:38:28] we read
[1:38:31] it whosoever watch in verse 15 there I
[1:38:35] love the way John contrast is when you
[1:38:37] get time maybe this evening maybe read
[1:38:39] all of chapter three and you'll find
[1:38:41] that God that John sets the contrast up
[1:38:44] of Cain and Abel and he gives the
[1:38:46] example of Cain how that Cain hated his
[1:38:49] brother of course and killed him
[1:38:51] and then he sets up the contrast of a
[1:38:54] person that says they love versus one
[1:38:57] that really does love and verse 15 he
[1:39:00] said whosoever hateth his brother is a
[1:39:05] murderer and you know that no
[1:39:08] murderer has eternal life abiding in him
[1:39:12] 1 John 3
[1:39:17] 16 hereby
[1:39:20] perceive
[1:39:23] we the love of
[1:39:26] God now look at the Greek word here
[1:39:29] perceive in the perfect tense Ginos in
[1:39:34] the perfect sense the word speaks of
[1:39:38] knowledge
[1:39:40] gained by
[1:39:42] experience so it's not just reading
[1:39:45] reading reading memorizing memorizing
[1:39:47] memorizing and committing it to memory
[1:39:49] and quoting quoting quoting and then
[1:39:51] that's that that's not knowledge no it's
[1:39:53] a knowledge that you gain by
[1:39:56] experiencing something so John says for
[1:39:58] those of us who have experienc herein
[1:40:02] perceive we the love of
[1:40:06] God because he laid down his
[1:40:10] life for us so the Saints have
[1:40:13] experienced the love of God in that he
[1:40:16] laid down his life for them now it's a
[1:40:20] two-faced experience
[1:40:22] then if you've really experienced that
[1:40:25] then part two of verse 16 will be in
[1:40:29] your soul to want to give expression to
[1:40:33] that love and this is the way the love
[1:40:35] of God continues
[1:40:37] on so they become the recipients of
[1:40:41] Salvation this imparts to them a Divine
[1:40:44] knowledge by experience now notice what
[1:40:47] Jo John goes on to say hereby perceive
[1:40:49] we the love of God because because he
[1:40:51] laid down his life for us we
[1:40:54] ought to lay down our
[1:41:04] lives
[1:41:07] wow for the
[1:41:10] Brethren so I have to be honest with you
[1:41:12] friends I I don't understand any
[1:41:15] Christian that likes to persecute
[1:41:18] people I I don't understand anybody that
[1:41:21] likes to persecute saints of God and
[1:41:24] make make life harder for them do you I
[1:41:27] don't understand that I don't understand
[1:41:29] anyone who could claim to be a Christian
[1:41:32] and get something out of posting things
[1:41:36] on Facebook or whatever they would do to
[1:41:38] make life harder for another
[1:41:41] individual I don't understand that that
[1:41:44] is not first John
[1:41:48] 3:16 now notice John catches this I
[1:41:52] remember being the disciple of love and
[1:41:55] reading this and studying this I
[1:41:56] couldn't keep from wondering about Peter
[1:41:59] what Peter must have thought when he
[1:42:00] read this verse and I wonder Peter
[1:42:02] wouldn't say like some of us help me
[1:42:05] Jesus help me Jesus now Peter's Faith
[1:42:09] was great to heal the sick John's was
[1:42:12] great to set the church in order and he
[1:42:13] was
[1:42:14] hope James brother but you imagine when
[1:42:18] John was sitting there in the spirit of
[1:42:20] God and this is written about the time
[1:42:22] of the Book of Revelation 90 ad so it
[1:42:25] was written around the time that the
[1:42:26] great Revelations are unfolding to John
[1:42:29] so with this Revelation John moves into
[1:42:32] this sphere of love that he had never
[1:42:34] experienced before you imagine what
[1:42:37] would make a man this is the very same
[1:42:39] man who wrote down John 3:16 that's
[1:42:43] right
[1:42:45] amen the very same
[1:42:49] man but something it happened to John
[1:42:52] after John
[1:42:54] 3:16 and after it happened to John John
[1:42:57] could write first
[1:43:00] John
[1:43:02] 3:16 because John 3:16 God had so given
[1:43:07] his love that John could say I have
[1:43:11] experienced
[1:43:13] that I believe there's many people today
[1:43:16] that can say the same thing how many can
[1:43:18] say with the reality I also
[1:43:21] and first John
[1:43:25] 3:16 okay we're going to make an a call
[1:43:27] for the rest of
[1:43:29] it I'm going to cancel lunch and pray
[1:43:31] for
[1:43:32] you now notice how he contrast this
[1:43:36] between Cain it's a stark contrast
[1:43:39] between hatred and real genuine love now
[1:43:41] this is a love that's
[1:43:43] unath you got to be kidding me that God
[1:43:45] would want us to love one another so
[1:43:48] much that we would be willing to lay our
[1:43:50] lives down for one another people think
[1:43:53] love you know well love your enemies all
[1:43:55] what that means is I don't I don't do
[1:43:57] nothing evil against them no no that's
[1:44:00] actually not what it
[1:44:02] means what it means is that you go out
[1:44:05] of your way to do good for people that
[1:44:08] would kill you if they
[1:44:12] could you see I'm moving farther and
[1:44:15] farther and farther away from the human
[1:44:17] conjecture of
[1:44:19] love to move you into a realm of total
[1:44:23] impossibility without divine
[1:44:26] intervention look friends I don't care
[1:44:28] how much you run how much you speak in
[1:44:30] tongues how much you shout how much you
[1:44:32] heal the sick you can give millions of
[1:44:34] dollars to the poor but if you don't
[1:44:37] have this you will never listen to me
[1:44:40] you will never go in the
[1:44:47] Rapture this is rapture
[1:44:52] status God help
[1:44:58] us can I got have a few more
[1:45:02] minutes four of you going to give me a
[1:45:04] few more
[1:45:04] minutes okay I'll take
[1:45:08] that Paul in Romans
[1:45:11] 16:13 greet Priscilla and Aquilla my
[1:45:16] helpers in Christ
[1:45:19] Jesus who have for my
[1:45:23] life laid down their own
[1:45:30] necks so here were
[1:45:32] people that were expressing first John
[1:45:38] 316 before it was ever
[1:45:43] written you see when Paul writes the
[1:45:45] book of Romans here around 55 ad 60
[1:45:48] something like that
[1:45:51] Aquilla and Priscilla were living this
[1:45:55] manifestation before John ever even
[1:45:57] wrote it in first
[1:46:00] John so you see this is why the Bible
[1:46:03] says that ye are living and written
[1:46:06] Epistles read and known of all men so
[1:46:09] what are we doing we're simply catching
[1:46:11] up with that which has been written for
[1:46:15] us but with them God was simply letting
[1:46:19] the writing catching up as a
[1:46:21] manifestation In the
[1:46:23] Flesh W well that went over the top of
[1:46:25] your head they were living it before it
[1:46:28] was even written so they were giving
[1:46:32] their lives now we don't know exactly
[1:46:34] the instance because we don't know all
[1:46:36] the examples and things that Paul went
[1:46:38] through as far as persecution and so on
[1:46:40] but apparently Aquilla and Priscilla
[1:46:42] which were husband and wife and all the
[1:46:44] Jews were banned out of Rome of course
[1:46:46] under the reign of Claudius the emperor
[1:46:49] and they had given he he literally used
[1:46:51] it as if though they had laid their
[1:46:53] necks down and this is a symbolism of of
[1:46:56] a metaphor that would say you know
[1:46:58] metaphor in our day that they literally
[1:47:00] laid their necks down on the chopping
[1:47:03] block for their heads to be cut
[1:47:06] off for this man of God oh
[1:47:12] amen John 3:16 had become so
[1:47:16] personified in these Christians they
[1:47:19] were willing to give their
[1:47:22] necks to save this man of
[1:47:26] God I find that so strange because many
[1:47:30] will give their
[1:47:32] souls an eternal separation to try to
[1:47:35] bring down every man of God they
[1:47:39] can that's the difference in
[1:47:42] hatred and
[1:47:45] love there are people who study men
[1:47:48] there are people who listen to our
[1:47:49] prophet message every day they listen to
[1:47:54] try to find fault they try to find this
[1:47:57] and that and the other so they can be
[1:47:58] able to post that on their site and do
[1:48:00] this and that don't they understand
[1:48:03] apparently
[1:48:05] not that one day they will stand before
[1:48:07] the Judgment seat and give an
[1:48:11] account many of them spend more time
[1:48:14] since they've left than they did while
[1:48:16] they were in it had they ate what they
[1:48:20] were listening to and become it their
[1:48:23] end might have been
[1:48:25] different oh but when the love of God so
[1:48:28] grabs a hold of a predestinated seed
[1:48:32] remember I ain't talking about everybody
[1:48:34] that's professes Christianity I ain't
[1:48:36] even talking about everybody that has
[1:48:38] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:48:42] that's question answer brother branam
[1:48:45] well every born again Christian go in
[1:48:49] the rapture
[1:48:50] no my brother sister they will not only
[1:48:56] the
[1:48:58] elect so that's watered down gospel
[1:49:02] that's been preached around the world
[1:49:03] not only around the world but even some
[1:49:05] of our message preachers are preaching
[1:49:07] it well you can belong to this
[1:49:09] denomination and that denomination
[1:49:10] whatever more and being the Rapture that
[1:49:13] is an absolute lie straight from the
[1:49:15] pits of hell I said straight from the
[1:49:18] pits of hell why am the world that we
[1:49:20] need a message in the end time to call
[1:49:23] us out and wash us from that filth of
[1:49:26] those prostitutes if we can stay in
[1:49:29] there and have rapturing faith come on
[1:49:31] somebody Hallelujah I want hell to know
[1:49:35] where we stand today on the Gospel of
[1:49:38] Jesus
[1:49:44] Christ you see the test of real
[1:49:46] discipleship is not just refusing to do
[1:49:50] someone harm which is where many of us
[1:49:54] hide we just refuse to do them harm
[1:49:57] that's not
[1:49:59] it it's actually looking for an
[1:50:02] opportunity when you can do them
[1:50:06] good you say where do you do where do
[1:50:09] you get that at I see it every day in
[1:50:12] this world we live in what if the Lord
[1:50:15] Jesus within the next 5 minutes stops
[1:50:18] every human being from breathing his
[1:50:21] created air that he gives them freely
[1:50:25] and he will only let those filled with
[1:50:26] the Holy Ghost breathe his
[1:50:29] air you talking about a mass
[1:50:31] burial what if the Lord stops sending
[1:50:34] rain for long spring will be around
[1:50:36] summer will be around we'll start
[1:50:37] planting our seeds our Gardens and so on
[1:50:39] and God says I'll tell you what I ain't
[1:50:40] going to do I ain't giving no more you
[1:50:42] bunch of Sinners my rain I'm only going
[1:50:45] to get my children rain I ain't even
[1:50:47] going to give y'all no more sun I'm
[1:50:48] going to start creating the Sun and in
[1:50:50] such a way that the sun will only shine
[1:50:52] on my
[1:50:53] children but Jesus said The Sun Shines
[1:50:56] on and the rain on the just and the
[1:50:59] unjust they don't even thank him for it
[1:51:01] how many of them had Thanksgiving dinner
[1:51:03] did they even pray did they even bow
[1:51:06] their head and say thank God but they SE
[1:51:08] celebrate it with wine come on here we
[1:51:10] are the last day of the year what would
[1:51:12] a lot of them do a lot of them say Lord
[1:51:14] thank you for another year they'll be
[1:51:16] drunk on a bunch of monkeys by in the
[1:51:18] morning and they'll get up and the
[1:51:20] headache and a hangover come on somebody
[1:51:22] but you know what if you're a child of
[1:51:24] God you say Lord thank you for what you
[1:51:26] helped us through 23 may we be better
[1:51:29] Christians than 24 may we give our life
[1:51:32] so he does good to those that hate him
[1:51:36] scientists that say there is no God and
[1:51:39] he gives them oxygen to
[1:51:45] breathe because he
[1:51:47] loves Humanity
[1:51:51] amen I just read this week the Lord
[1:51:56] God allowed
[1:51:59] science to break into an
[1:52:02] enzyme in the core of
[1:52:05] pineapple I want you to listen to
[1:52:08] this and by research he let them find
[1:52:12] that enzyme
[1:52:15] braling and they started using it on
[1:52:18] burn victim
[1:52:23] now up to this time a burn victim they
[1:52:25] would have to go into the epidermis and
[1:52:27] all them different layers of skin and
[1:52:29] get down to where the skin would
[1:52:30] actually
[1:52:32] bleed but what they found was they could
[1:52:35] extract this broline from a core of a
[1:52:39] pineapple and put that on burn skin and
[1:52:42] within 4 hours every bit of that burn
[1:52:46] skin is totally dissolved
[1:52:53] of course man will take credit for it
[1:52:56] well was man the one who put it in the
[1:52:58] core of the
[1:53:00] pineapple God in his Mercy let man find
[1:53:04] what he already put inside of there now
[1:53:07] maybe that might not mean much to you
[1:53:09] cuz most of us ain't never been burned
[1:53:10] but I guarantee you one thing those that
[1:53:12] have been burned the many of them will
[1:53:14] be spared from this time on of having to
[1:53:17] go through one surgery after another
[1:53:19] after another why the grace of God let
[1:53:22] them break into his laboratory I praise
[1:53:26] God for that myself I thank God for
[1:53:29] every one of those things they can find
[1:53:31] but remember they never made that it was
[1:53:34] not them that put it there God put it
[1:53:37] there that's why the prophet prayed
[1:53:40] every day they would find a cure for
[1:53:46] cancer why because he loved
[1:53:53] Humanity I know I've give you a lot to
[1:53:56] contemplate but we'll be like sheep
[1:53:58] we'll ruminate we'll feed on it again
[1:54:00] and again and
[1:54:01] again let's stand we'll pick it up
[1:54:13] again I found this I thought it was very
[1:54:16] interesting
[1:54:18] self-preservation is the first law of
[1:54:20] physical life but
[1:54:24] self-sacrifice is the First
[1:54:26] Law of Spiritual
[1:54:30] life a new commandment I give unto you
[1:54:34] that you love one
[1:54:36] another as
[1:54:38] I have loved
[1:54:40] you any honest people here today I know
[1:54:44] there are that can say Lord I need more
[1:54:47] of
[1:54:48] this I need
[1:54:51] more love is greater than
[1:54:55] healing love is greater than
[1:54:58] emotion it's the most powerful force
[1:55:01] that's ever been given to the
[1:55:03] world
[1:55:06] love for
[1:55:08] myself as we come to the close of this
[1:55:10] year this year my what a year it has
[1:55:13] been I'm so glad at the beginning of
[1:55:15] this year I did not look down through 23
[1:55:18] and see all the things we were going
[1:55:19] want to go through amen I did not have a
[1:55:22] clue at the beginning of
[1:55:24] 23 that my little daughter will be taken
[1:55:28] from us I didn't have a clue that many
[1:55:31] that have set Among Us would be taken
[1:55:33] from us many of the things you've been
[1:55:36] through you probably thought oh my I'm
[1:55:38] so glad I didn't know it was going to
[1:55:40] happen I understand I'm glad I can't
[1:55:42] look into 24 because I'd probably be
[1:55:44] scared to death when you you say oh my
[1:55:46] goodness what's coming what's coming but
[1:55:48] God don't want us to live under under
[1:55:49] that captivating paralyzing
[1:55:52] fear I'm glad I cannot see in the future
[1:55:55] myself I just have enough light to walk
[1:55:58] day by day by day amen thank God for it
[1:56:04] can we bow our
[1:56:06] heads now with sincerity from your
[1:56:10] heart I want to ask you how many of you
[1:56:13] said Lord I'm being honest before you
[1:56:15] today I need more of what I heard
[1:56:19] preached
[1:56:21] I don't want to just just refuse to do
[1:56:24] bad against people but I want to look
[1:56:27] for opportunities of
[1:56:30] good I thank you I'm a recipient of the
[1:56:32] grace of God but I also want to be the
[1:56:36] manifestation of 1 John
[1:56:41] 3:16
[1:56:44] hallelujah thank you Lord we're going to
[1:56:48] pray
[1:56:50] just had this request given to me pray
[1:56:52] for brother Matthew carway and sister
[1:56:55] shayvon they both have been here in the
[1:56:56] service today but both of them have been
[1:56:58] sick all during the
[1:57:01] service let's pray for them right now as
[1:57:06] well father we come before you as
[1:57:10] children children
[1:57:12] that we
[1:57:15] realize without your love and your mercy
[1:57:17] in our hearts will never be able to
[1:57:22] attain to this great great
[1:57:26] love it seems almost unfathomable in our
[1:57:29] minds that a human being could get to a
[1:57:33] spot that they would do this and not do
[1:57:36] it because of
[1:57:38] legalism but do it because you are so in
[1:57:42] their
[1:57:44] souls they want to do
[1:57:47] it I'm sure there's people on this this
[1:57:50] building if it was between me and them
[1:57:55] dying if a man walked in this building
[1:57:57] today with a gun and said I'm going to
[1:57:59] shoot one of you there's Brothers in
[1:58:01] here that I know that love me so much
[1:58:03] that' say no take me let him

[1:58:20] that would tell Erica sister Erica I
[1:58:23] would gladly give my life and let you
[1:58:26] live brother told me the other day his
[1:58:28] wife had said she was an older lady and
[1:58:32] said I I would give my life to let
[1:58:35] sister Erica Live Well the younger
[1:58:37] sisters even of our church said it I
[1:58:40] would gladly give my life so sister
[1:58:43] Erica could

[1:58:47] love but father they didn't have have to
[1:58:49] do that you gave yours so she could live
[1:58:54] and she does she does
[1:58:58] live but it does our hearts good to hear
[1:59:01] Lord that we can enter into this land of
[1:59:06] perfect
[1:59:08] love that we would be willing to lay
[1:59:11] down our lives for one
[1:59:14] another oh what a reward that aquill and
[1:59:18] Priscilla will receive that day whatever
[1:59:21] the instance was that
[1:59:24] they had put their lives in
[1:59:28] Jeopardy Lord what a reward it will be
[1:59:30] for men of God who have jeopardized
[1:59:33] their lives preaching the
[1:59:36] gospel Lord some of the brothers that
[1:59:38] went into the jungles of Africa and
[1:59:40] India and the
[1:59:41] Philippines risked their
[1:59:43] lives I know some of the missionary
[1:59:45] Brothers in Africa have went among the
[1:59:48] head hunters
[1:59:49] they still have Head Hunters alive
[1:59:52] today and risk their lives to introduce
[1:59:56] them to the Lord
[1:59:58] Jesus they risk their lives to preach
[2:00:01] the
[2:00:02] truth brothers that have gone in to
[2:00:06] China into
[2:00:08] Vietnam into places where it's illegal
[2:00:10] to preach the
[2:00:12] gospel having stood there in China
[2:00:14] myself several times and knowing I risk
[2:00:18] being arrested rested every time I
[2:00:21] went but seeing those saints that hunger
[2:00:23] in their
[2:00:25] hearts seeing their faith so
[2:00:28] simple Lord I don't know that I'll ever
[2:00:30] forget that sister in that hotel room
[2:00:33] that night
[2:00:35] Lord they pushed her in in a
[2:00:38] wheelchair she couldn't
[2:00:40] walk but after prayer was made and at
[2:00:43] the end of the service she pushed her
[2:00:45] wheelchair out of the
[2:00:47] room how
[2:00:51] Hallelujah because you're still the same
[2:00:53] yesterday today and
[2:00:56] forever we love to see you manifest
[2:00:59] yourself that way Lord but we're asking
[2:01:02] you today for
[2:01:04] something even greater than the lame
[2:01:08] walking we're asking you for something
[2:01:10] greater Lord we've seen you heal the
[2:01:12] sick we saw you right here just a few
[2:01:15] minutes ago Lord raise a sister that had
[2:01:18] stopped breathing
[2:01:20] we saw you give her
[2:01:23] life but father today we're standing
