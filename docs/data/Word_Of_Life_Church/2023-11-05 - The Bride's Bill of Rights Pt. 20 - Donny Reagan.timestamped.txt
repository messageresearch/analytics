[43:25] know that um we're certainly not the
[43:28] first ones to go through these sort of
[43:29] things but you know whenever it's you it
[43:32] certainly makes it real doesn't it I've
[43:35] buried over aund and something people
[43:37] since I've been here the years that I
[43:39] came here years ago but it's uh I
[43:42] believe we're getting one grave closer
[43:46] one to the last
[43:48] one praise the Lord let's turn today if
[43:52] you would to Luke chapter 21 verse verse
[43:55] 9
[43:58] Luke
[43:59] 21:9 I'd like to speak to you again
[44:01] today on a life above ungodly
[44:06] fear a life above ungodly
[44:10] fear but when you shall hear of wars and
[44:15] commotions be not
[44:17] terrified for these
[44:20] things what's that next word must must
[44:25] these things must first come to pass but
[44:30] the end is not by and
[44:33] by then said he unto them Nation shall
[44:37] rise against
[44:41] nation and Kingdom against
[44:45] Kingdom and great earthquake shall be in
[44:48] diverse places and famines and
[44:53] pestilences and fearful
[44:58] sights and Great
[45:01] Signs
[45:02] fearful
[45:04] sights kind of makes me wonder when the
[45:07] prophets and even the Lord Jesus when
[45:10] they would say things like this what
[45:12] they must have been looking up and the
[45:14] Bible tells us of course you're in verse
[45:16] n seven and 8 and n as it goes to deal
[45:19] with all this that there will be fearful
[45:21] signs in the
[45:23] heavens I wonder what they would have
[45:25] seen
[45:27] I wonder what they would have thought if
[45:29] they would have seen the video that
[45:31] Carol and I saw last
[45:34] night it is an aircraft that has been
[45:37] made by our nation which has been around
[45:39] for many years it's called the
[45:42] B2
[45:44] bomber spirit is what they call it B2
[45:48] Spirit
[45:50] bomber so it's not like an F-15 Tom Cat
[45:53] an A10 warthog an F16
[45:56] but this one is made altogether
[45:58] different it's a flying wing so it's
[46:02] shaped like a bat
[46:05] wing cannot be picked up on
[46:09] radar it can contain over
[46:13] 50,000 lbs of
[46:16] armament Conventional Weapons and also
[46:21] nuclear as I looked at that last night
[46:24] and I saw that that B2 there and I saw
[46:27] all of those missiles and all of those
[46:30] bombs nuclear and conventional laying in
[46:33] front of this one
[46:35] airplane enough to be able to paralyze
[46:40] the country of
[46:41] Iran was only one
[46:45] bomber I wonder what them prophets would
[46:47] have SED that have looked up in division
[46:49] in the night and would have saw this
[46:51] Wing come flying through that's so
[46:54] massive is that
[46:56] terrifying yeah to the human aspect it
[46:59] is but I'm glad today it don't scare
[47:03] me notice what Jesus goes on to say
[47:06] fearful
[47:07] sights and Great Signs shall there be
[47:12] from heaven so this word here actually
[47:16] means in heaven as well but Romans
[47:21] 8:15 Paul writes and says for ye have
[47:24] not received the Spirit of bondage again
[47:27] to
[47:27] fear but ye have received the spirit of
[47:31] adoption where C whereby we cry ABA
[47:35] father or father father or dear

[49:07] approach bless us today Father in the
[49:10] name of Jesus we pray and the Saints
[49:12] said amen God bless you you may be
[49:20] seated I can
[49:22] imagine the year five a 6 as they begin
[49:26] to look out over the
[49:29] walls and they saw this Mighty
[49:33] buildup they saw
[49:36] catapults they saw thousands times
[49:39] thousands of
[49:41] soldiers they saw weapons maybe that
[49:44] they' never even seen
[49:46] before they saw captains generals
[49:50] battalions ranks of men foot soldiers
[49:54] and they saw it building little by
[49:56] little by little if you're not familiar
[49:59] with the time frame it's Jerusalem it's
[50:03] the prophecy of the Prophet
[50:06] Jeremiah when he said that God would
[50:09] send a mighty Army from the north and
[50:12] they would destroy
[50:15] Jerusalem it must have been that the
[50:17] people in Jerusalem still many of them
[50:20] were convinced God was going to move
[50:24] everything was going to be found
[50:26] oh he had moved many times before and
[50:29] the enemy had been laid waste and they
[50:32] were convinced by false prophets to not
[50:36] believe the word of
[50:39] Jeremiah now if you would have been
[50:40] living in that day and I would have been
[50:42] in that day wonder who we would have
[50:45] believed
[50:46] Jeremiah or
[50:49] hananiah would we have believed Jeremiah
[50:53] or the rest of those prophets which were
[50:55] prophet prophesying and running up and
[50:57] down the road and screaming and all just
[50:59] glory to God I feel the anointing all
[51:02] over me but they were saying the exact
[51:05] opposite of what Jeremiah said it's
[51:08] always been that way that God will have
[51:10] his true Prophet come and then there'll
[51:12] be somebody or many that will come and
[51:15] try to water it down and make it more
[51:17] acceptable make it more social and so on
[51:21] but yet the minority of the people
[51:24] believed what God Prophet had said this
[51:28] Siege is going to take quite some time
[51:30] months actually they will come to a spot
[51:34] to where that they will be such
[51:38] desperation and eventually
[51:40] Nebuchadnezzar will take over the city
[51:43] will be destroyed and as I mentioned to
[51:46] you the other day I saw a piece of a
[51:49] temp that had been buried in the dirt
[51:53] around Jerusalem and the residue which
[51:55] had been laying there since
[51:58] 586 BC think of that 586 BC and just a
[52:04] short time ago they dug it up and carbon
[52:08] 14 dated it and here was a part of the
[52:11] Timber that actually made the first
[52:14] temple the house of
[52:17] God now did God want to do that of
[52:21] course not was it God being a mean God
[52:23] that wanted to destroy that Temple
[52:25] it was the sins of the people that made
[52:29] God do it and no doubt there were people
[52:32] there that were totally convinced
[52:34] everything is going to be fine there was
[52:36] an element of them that become as it
[52:38] become closer and closer and zedi got
[52:41] closer to the end of it then he began to
[52:43] consult with the prophet but by the time
[52:46] he said okay okay okay I I agree I agree
[52:49] you know what this is overwhelming and
[52:51] maybe I've messed up I I I want you to
[52:53] intervene for us I want you you Prophet
[52:56] because prophets of the Old Testament
[52:58] were entering into a place of God's
[53:00] presence and God would actually hear
[53:02] their cry but this had come too far God
[53:07] actually said it would be a time that
[53:09] even if Daniel was there he wouldn't
[53:11] hear Daniel if Jeremiah prayed he
[53:15] wouldn't even hear Jeremiah I'm afraid
[53:17] our nation and our world is at the same
[53:21] place
[53:23] again but it as sad as it was as
[53:28] difficult as it was that is very mild
[53:31] compared to what lays before us in this
[53:34] day we're living because even in the
[53:37] time of Nebuchadnezzar he did not have
[53:39] the Armament or the ability or the
[53:42] Ingenuity to be able to annihilate the
[53:49] Earth the B2 Spirit Bomb that I just or
[53:52] plane that I just described to you has
[53:55] capabilities of carrying nuclear
[53:59] weapons that are 22 times more
[54:04] destructive than the fat boy that was
[54:07] dropped on hirosima
[54:11] man has reached a place to where he can
[54:16] annihilate
[54:20] himself man has reached the place to
[54:23] where that one nation after another has
[54:27] nuclear
[54:30] capability what should we do run to the
[54:33] rock that is bigger than we are I tell
[54:37] you a friend you'll never be able to
[54:39] have a bomb shelter or brother Donnie
[54:41] I'm ordering a concrete one I'm ordering
[54:43] a steel one do you understand the impact
[54:46] of those bombs will cause concussion so
[54:50] strong it will break every bone in the
[54:54] human body body you'll not be able to
[54:59] survive now I'm not really preaching
[55:01] this way for bride I'm preaching this
[55:04] way for those who going to be left
[55:07] behind now I wish I could stand here
[55:09] today and say that I I know beyond a
[55:12] shadow of a doubt everybody in our
[55:14] church will be in the Rapture but I
[55:17] don't know that I wish I could say that
[55:20] everybody in Johnson City in the
[55:22] surrounding areas will be hid on the
[55:24] rock of
[55:25] ah but Al last you see I cannot say that
[55:29] the only way that I know that we will be
[55:31] safe and secure is not on your daddy's
[55:34] religion or your mama's religion but you
[55:37] yourself know the Lord Jesus in such a
[55:40] real way that you have the token applied
[55:43] to your life and that way you can look
[55:46] at the hour that we're living in and
[55:49] somehow you can look at the Spirit Two
[55:52] Bomber and you say I'm not afraid of it
[55:55] you can look at the messenger which is
[55:58] the one that Russia has built was
[56:02] Hypersonic missiles faster than the
[56:06] speed of sound five times faster than
[56:11] the speed of sound bombs that can move
[56:15] so fast that our F-16 tomat our A10
[56:20] warthog our F-15 Fighters many of the on
[56:25] that we have cannot even intercept them
[56:29] but you can look at that and read about
[56:31] it and think I'm Not Afraid now that
[56:35] would seem foolish I know but what if
[56:38] brother Donnie what if what if they
[56:40] sneak in that's exactly what they will
[56:43] do but you see the majority of the world
[56:46] is so convinced All America is this
[56:50] Mighty power I will say America was this
[56:54] this Mighty power but she ain't no more
[56:58] come on you Americans you might as well
[56:59] say Amen America used to be the very
[57:02] symbol of strength and the Very symbol
[57:05] of power but she's no longer that our
[57:08] enemies recognize that we are a nation
[57:11] that was a great Mighty power but now we
[57:15] are a weak Nation because we have weak
[57:20] leadership and we have weak pull pits
[57:23] and we have weak preachers in them P
[57:26] pits and we have weak Mamas and weak
[57:30] daddies in the
[57:33] homes there's only one hope and that's
[57:36] the coming of the Lord
[57:38] Jesus imagine that when the people began
[57:43] to notice the upbuilding of this Great
[57:47] Mighty power and they looked at and
[57:49] realized it was too late you can imagine
[57:53] in 70 AD whenever Titus begins to move
[57:57] his mighty Army and they gather once
[58:00] again around Jerusalem the Lord Jesus
[58:04] had said it some years ago oh harem
[58:08] harem how of I would have gathered you
[58:10] as a hen does gather her brood but now
[58:13] your house is left unto you desolate and
[58:17] he wept as he sat on the Mount of Olives
[58:19] and cried and the people laughed and
[58:22] made fun of him I wonder what they
[58:24] thought whenever they looked out there
[58:26] and there was Titus with his mighty Army
[58:29] again the great catapults again the
[58:32] great ability to devastate their city
[58:36] and then they would starve them out once
[58:38] more they would starve them to a place
[58:42] that the parents would eat one another's
[58:46] children they pull the bark off of the
[58:50] trees they pull the leaf off of the
[58:53] trees when people would die out of
[58:57] starvation they would actually fight
[59:00] over who got the
[59:04] corpse becoming
[59:08] cannibals I'm not talking about Russians
[59:11] I'm not talking about Hamas right I'm
[59:14] talking about staunch Jews that's right
[59:18] that said they believed
[59:21] Adonai but they had crucified that on
[59:25] night when he become
[59:27] flesh somebody say Amen but remember
[59:30] Jesus told some of them whenever you see
[59:33] this come you beware and there wasn't
[59:36] one of those elect that was caught
[59:39] inside that City they got out of there
[59:42] when the good times was that's when they
[59:45] left look friend it's very important
[59:48] where you are found when these times
[59:51] arise you don't want to be found in that
[59:55] stalk Church you don't want to be found
[59:59] in a compromising hybridized Church
[1:00:03] system when the life cycle moves around
[1:00:06] oh no wonder the prophet said that if
[1:00:08] your name is found in that stalk book
[1:00:12] lost you will be it's very important
[1:00:17] where you are caught when the Rapture
[1:00:20] comes I'll tell you where I want to be
[1:00:21] caught I want to be called under the
[1:00:24] Banner of our Lord Jesus Christ I want
[1:00:28] to be if I'm alive and well I want to be
[1:00:31] identified among the saints of God I
[1:00:34] want to be identified in a church that
[1:00:37] believes he's the same yesterday today
[1:00:40] and forever and still preaches the
[1:00:43] oldfashioned gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:00:46] anybody want to be identified there I
[1:00:48] want to be hid right there because where
[1:00:51] you are found when the trumpet sounds
[1:00:54] will dictate where you wind
[1:01:00] up not one child of God was found there
[1:01:06] you imagine it got to such a place that
[1:01:09] when Titus actually finally took it over
[1:01:12] and marked through and again they burnt
[1:01:15] the temple and Jesus said it I stood
[1:01:17] there a few years ago and saw one Mighty
[1:01:20] stone that was longer than from this
[1:01:23] pull pit Plum to the back wall one stone
[1:01:26] one
[1:01:27] stone and it was sh out oh my just
[1:01:31] massive you just can't even hardly
[1:01:33] comprehend how they could do such and
[1:01:35] then hewers of that stone would take
[1:01:38] their chisels and carve all the way
[1:01:40] around it a band that would be similar
[1:01:43] to a Roman Ochi those of you that
[1:01:45] understand what that is and how they was
[1:01:47] able to cut that out of solid Stone and
[1:01:50] they thought no doubt this will never
[1:01:53] fall and Jesus Jesus said there won't be
[1:01:55] one stone that'll be left upon another
[1:01:59] and they laid there for years and years
[1:02:02] as I stood there as one of the last
[1:02:04] phases of our visit in Jerusalem and the
[1:02:06] guide pointed out that they had just
[1:02:08] recently found it it was called Wilson's
[1:02:11] Arch and it was a bridge made out of
[1:02:14] solid stone that had been carved and it
[1:02:16] had laid under the rubble for 2,000
[1:02:20] years and they just dug it out and it
[1:02:22] was an archway that take him from where
[1:02:25] the street market was and the sellers
[1:02:27] and the vendors and it would take him to
[1:02:29] the upper platform to where the temple
[1:02:32] was and I thought there it was it had
[1:02:34] laid there for all of those years
[1:02:36] bearing the record of the words of the
[1:02:39] Lord Jesus there won't be one stone left
[1:02:42] upon another and now they have to dig
[1:02:45] down feet I'm talking about this was
[1:02:48] laying under debris that was 50 and 60
[1:02:51] ft deep of debris yet it was prophecy
[1:02:55] laying fulfill right down there oh my if
[1:02:59] God would so watch over his word in that
[1:03:02] day what about in our day but I ask you
[1:03:06] does God want us to live under Atomic
[1:03:09] fear the answer is no does God want us
[1:03:13] to live under the fear of the
[1:03:16] tribulation period absolutely not does
[1:03:19] he want us to move with haste the Bible
[1:03:22] says when God spoke to Noah that Noah
[1:03:26] moved with fear you know that the Bible
[1:03:29] says that Noah moved with fear I believe
[1:03:34] that we in the end time ought to move
[1:03:36] with fear but not an ungodly fear God
[1:03:40] don't want you serving him God don't
[1:03:43] want me serving him out of a fear that
[1:03:46] I'm afraid I'll go to hell or a fear
[1:03:48] that oh no oh no God's going to get me
[1:03:50] God is not looking for an excuse to
[1:03:53] punish you God is not looking for an
[1:03:56] excuse to punish me he went out of his
[1:03:59] way to save us he went out of his way to
[1:04:02] heal us he went out of his way to
[1:04:05] deliver us he does not want to punish us
[1:04:09] he wants to set us free he does not want
[1:04:12] us to be under a slavish fear but he
[1:04:15] wants us to be motivated by a fear all
[1:04:18] right a fear that we're afraid will
[1:04:21] displease him that's my fear that this
[1:04:24] morning I'm so afraid that I might miss
[1:04:27] his will somehow or I might not do how
[1:04:29] many understands what I'm saying I might
[1:04:32] miss him or I'm not going a direction
[1:04:34] that wouldn't please him but I do not
[1:04:36] believe he wants us to live under a fear
[1:04:40] of cancer I don't believe he wants us to
[1:04:43] live under a fear of failure some of you
[1:04:46] sitting right here today and some of you
[1:04:48] listen are constantly living under a
[1:04:50] fear of failure and you're afraid you'll
[1:04:53] mess up up and mess up you won't even
[1:04:56] try to sing you won't even try to do
[1:04:58] nothing for the kingdom of God so you're
[1:05:01] F so afraid of fear but what if I mess
[1:05:04] up what if I mess up I preach thousands
[1:05:07] of sermons I ain't never preached a
[1:05:09] perfect one I've sung thousands of songs
[1:05:13] I ain't never sung a perfect one nor has
[1:05:15] any other preacher or any other singer
[1:05:18] do you want me to wait till I preach the
[1:05:21] first perfect one or should I go ahead
[1:05:23] and preach my Frailty this morning
[1:05:26] should the singers go ahead and sing in
[1:05:28] their Frailty sing in their Humanity
[1:05:31] that I say as a people of God we need to
[1:05:34] Rise Above This ungodly fear that will
[1:05:38] try to hold us back oh but there's
[1:05:41] cancer everywhere brother Donnie I
[1:05:43] understand I read just this morning
[1:05:46] where a disease X that they are already
[1:05:49] working on right now in the Laboratories
[1:05:52] and they're saying it will be 20 times
[1:05:54] worse than Co it will be more
[1:05:57] devastating it will be more deadly but I
[1:06:00] say as the people of God by his Tripes
[1:06:03] we are already healed of disease
[1:06:07] X amen by his promise of the word he
[1:06:12] cannot lie come on somebody he cannot
[1:06:16] lie our god is perfect oh my brother
[1:06:18] Donnie what if somebody dies with with
[1:06:21] disease act what if they do all I can
[1:06:23] say is it was their time to go let me
[1:06:26] remind you again cancer did not defeat
[1:06:29] my daughter my daughter defeated cancer
[1:06:34] amen every child of God that goes by the
[1:06:37] way of the Grave if they could not have
[1:06:40] went unless our father said come on home
[1:06:43] honey come on home child and it was only
[1:06:47] a way out of this world into that
[1:06:50] Kingdom that they have been born into
[1:06:56] oh I got such a beautiful text from a
[1:06:58] brother a minister up in Canada last
[1:07:00] week and he was telling me you know how
[1:07:03] that he had prayed and his church had
[1:07:05] prayed for Erica so many times we are so
[1:07:08] grateful for each prayer that was made
[1:07:10] and he told me he said you know brother
[1:07:11] Donnie the devil was not just after her
[1:07:14] body but the devil was after her face
[1:07:17] and he never got her face I thought what
[1:07:20] a powerful statement that the devil
[1:07:22] wasn't just after her body he was after
[1:07:26] her faith you know you realize that's
[1:07:28] what he's after for us today he would
[1:07:30] try to make us doubt and make us wonder
[1:07:33] over the sovereignty of God and why
[1:07:36] would God do this and why would God let
[1:07:38] this you know what he's after he's after
[1:07:41] your faith he wants you to somehow doubt
[1:07:44] and somehow question brother Donnie do
[1:07:46] you understand any better I don't
[1:07:48] understand any better today than I did a
[1:07:51] few weeks ago when we had our graduation
[1:07:53] service but I know this I trust him with
[1:07:56] all of my heart and what I can't
[1:07:59] understand I say the Lord don't make no
[1:08:01] mistake come on somebody let's have
[1:08:03] church do I understand why the Lord took
[1:08:06] her no I don't do I understand the way
[1:08:09] he took her no I don't but I understand
[1:08:12] this my God is absolutely perfect he is
[1:08:15] without fault he makes no mistakes and
[1:08:18] I'll say to the devil Satan you never
[1:08:21] won my daughter won Satan you did not
[1:08:25] win over Junior Davis Junior Davis won
[1:08:28] over the devil Satan you did not win oh
[1:08:31] Hallelujah over Jim bab Jim bab one over
[1:08:35] the
[1:08:35] [Applause]
[1:08:42] devil notice this second Timothy 1:7 For
[1:08:46] God has not given us the spirit of fear
[1:08:49] but of power and love and of a sound
[1:08:52] mind 1 John 4:18 there is no fear in
[1:08:56] love but perfect love casteth out fear
[1:08:59] because fear hath torment he that fear
[1:09:02] it is not made perfect in love I love
[1:09:04] the way the prophet catches this dealing
[1:09:06] with fear and love and he said but
[1:09:08] perfect love casteth out fear the reason
[1:09:11] you're
[1:09:12] fearful is because the right
[1:09:15] temperaments of
[1:09:18] love has never entered
[1:09:22] yet
[1:09:24] praise God the right Temperance of love
[1:09:29] has never entered yet when there's real
[1:09:31] love all fear passes away amen when you
[1:09:36] really love the Lord anybody say Amen
[1:09:41] notice again so if the church only knew
[1:09:43] its position and the greatest hindrance
[1:09:46] in the church is fear they're afraid it
[1:09:51] just won't work
[1:09:54] it just won't work and as long as we're
[1:09:56] afraid it won't work most of us will
[1:09:59] never attempt
[1:10:01] it because we're afraid we'll get
[1:10:04] embarrassed so if we confess that God's
[1:10:07] A Healer and God's a deliverer and it
[1:10:09] would be God's will to take us then we
[1:10:11] feel like well I I I got
[1:10:13] embarrassed we got embarrassed somehow
[1:10:15] cuz we prayed for so and so and the Lord
[1:10:18] took them and said heal and we got
[1:10:19] embarrassed he heard your prayer that's
[1:10:22] right he healed them from their Mor
[1:10:24] ality don't think your prayer was not
[1:10:27] answered notice he said they're afraid
[1:10:29] it just won't work it won't work for you
[1:10:32] that way it will not work that way it
[1:10:34] must absolutely be Believers not make
[1:10:37] Believers but Believers from your heart
[1:10:39] love has no fear love casts out fear and
[1:10:44] I notice in my meetings so much when I
[1:10:46] come to the people one the great things
[1:10:48] I found among them is fear and what
[1:10:50] makes fear is a lack of confidence
[1:10:55] lack of confidence if you lack
[1:10:58] confidence it'll make you fear praise
[1:11:01] the Lord it'll make you feel well I just
[1:11:04] don't know if God will or not well
[1:11:05] brother Donnie I mean you you pray for
[1:11:07] sister Eric and you pray for others is
[1:11:09] going to die I guess that means you're
[1:11:10] going to stop praying you guess wrong
[1:11:13] I'm going to pray more ferven than I've
[1:11:15] ever prayed in my life remember when
[1:11:17] brother Bram was a little girl died and
[1:11:19] she was in so much pain that her eyes
[1:11:21] crossed with the pain and notice what
[1:11:24] that done to that prophet he said there
[1:11:27] was never a crosseyed child that come
[1:11:30] across the platform that was not healed
[1:11:34] why because that looking reminded him of
[1:11:37] his little Sharon Rose it made him hate
[1:11:39] that devil more than ever before so if
[1:11:42] you think I'm going to pray for
[1:11:43] everybody except those that have cancer
[1:11:46] you are 100% wrong I'm going to pray
[1:11:49] with more fervency than I've ever prayed
[1:11:51] in my life because I hate hate that
[1:11:54] devil more than I've ever hated him come
[1:11:56] on somebody oh my just because we pray
[1:12:00] for him and the Lord takes them does not
[1:12:03] mean he did not hear our prayer he
[1:12:07] did oh
[1:12:09] my notice this he said what makes fear
[1:12:13] is a lack of confidence you lack
[1:12:16] confidence it'll make you fear but if
[1:12:17] you love it Cast Away that fear and
[1:12:21] that's the way God wants the church not
[1:12:23] so much charter members he wants members
[1:12:26] that's loyal how many wants to be loyal
[1:12:28] and loves and believes and has
[1:12:31] confidence it but you see Satan works on
[1:12:35] these things that are naturally
[1:12:37] negativity that we're prone to we're
[1:12:39] born negative so we're prone to worry
[1:12:43] we're prone to have fear instead of
[1:12:46] Faith we're more prone to be scared than
[1:12:49] we are to be Valiant we're more prone to
[1:12:52] be fear fearful than we are to be
[1:12:55] Gallant we're more prone to be that way
[1:12:58] it comes that way in our natural birth
[1:13:00] so every time we stand galling on the
[1:13:02] word we have to go against ourself to do
[1:13:05] it oh man notice this about worry if you
[1:13:09] notice it's when you're
[1:13:12] discouraged oh my when you're
[1:13:16] discouraged that's when the devil can
[1:13:19] pour it on you how many's ever been
[1:13:22] discouraged and you know that to be the
[1:13:24] truth boy when you get down it's like
[1:13:26] the devil just empties out everything I
[1:13:29] me here comes a big old UK truck he EMP
[1:13:31] his this out on you he's got that and
[1:13:33] EMP his out and you say Lord have mercy
[1:13:36] what in the world is going on he
[1:13:37] recognizes that you're discourage I know
[1:13:39] y'all think I'm weird anyway but I'm
[1:13:41] going to share a little bit more of my
[1:13:42] auditude with you there's times when I
[1:13:44] get down so low and I go to pray I don't
[1:13:48] even say
[1:13:52] anything come on
[1:13:54] so I'm just there before the Lord and
[1:13:56] I'm not saying
[1:13:58] nothing cuz I know if I say it out loud
[1:14:02] the devil will hear it so I'm just there
[1:14:05] before the Lord and in My Heart Lord you
[1:14:07] know where I'm at Lord you see Lord I I
[1:14:10] I I really need your help but it don't
[1:14:12] say it here that's crazy is it question
[1:14:14] answer 64 brother brandom you told us
[1:14:16] when you went out west first and now the
[1:14:18] second time you ever went you know so
[1:14:20] well well brother sister that that's in
[1:14:21] my heart and if I speak it out the devil
[1:14:24] will hear it so he don't know anything
[1:14:26] about it I just keep it in my heart
[1:14:28] sometimes when you go to pray and you
[1:14:29] kind of we and you down the devil don't
[1:14:31] even know what a good job he's doing
[1:14:33] until you open that fat mouth of yours
[1:14:35] and say Lord I'm so down Lord I'm so
[1:14:37] weary Lord I don't know if I'll even
[1:14:39] make it another day or not you should
[1:14:41] never say that just get down and
[1:14:44] [Music]
[1:14:48] go Lord have mercy brother Donnie you
[1:14:51] don't I do oh yes I do and the devil say
[1:14:55] the boy's cracked the boy is out of his
[1:14:57] mind he don't know what's in my heart
[1:15:00] but I ain't going to tell him I ain't
[1:15:02] going to tell him Lord I've never been
[1:15:04] so low in my life Lord I've never been
[1:15:06] so this and that and the other because
[1:15:08] the devil say we finally got him boys we
[1:15:11] about got him but when you get down
[1:15:13] there and you just hold it in your heart
[1:15:15] and the devil's waiting and waiting and
[1:15:17] waiting and brother V he just getting
[1:15:19] tired of waiting and you're just smiling
[1:15:21] and just you know just sitting there and
[1:15:23] Lord in your heart you're just having a
[1:15:24] prayer meeting with God and God saying
[1:15:27] yes son I hear you yes daughter I know
[1:15:30] what you're going through and the
[1:15:31] devil's saying how's God hearing them I
[1:15:33] don't hear one thing said because God
[1:15:36] can hear your heart when your mouth
[1:15:38] ain't saying one thing a lot of us are
[1:15:41] too blabber mths We Get Down On Our
[1:15:43] Knees to pray and we tell the devil
[1:15:46] everything in the world that's going on
[1:15:48] oh I wish somebody would hear me today
[1:15:51] but sometimes we need to kind of Tri the
[1:15:53] devil a little bit and just get down and
[1:15:55] say oh thank you Jesus oh thank you
[1:15:59] Jesus oh I love you Lord oh thank you
[1:16:03] Lord God I worship you Lord God and the
[1:16:06] devil said what in the world's a matter
[1:16:08] with him what in the world's a matter
[1:16:09] with her well you refuse to be able to
[1:16:12] sell the devil how successful that he is
[1:16:14] and they said well I'm from confused I
[1:16:17] don't even understand what's going on
[1:16:18] well good that's what I wanted to do I
[1:16:21] think we let the devil mess with us too
[1:16:23] much and we need to start a kind of
[1:16:25] messing with him a little bit and let
[1:16:27] him know we are more than Victors we are
[1:16:30] more than conquerors through him that
[1:16:33] gave himself for us we're not going to
[1:16:35] live under ungodly fear we are going to
[1:16:38] live under the joy of the Lord because
[1:16:41] that's our
[1:16:47] strength yes sir if you come to church
[1:16:51] and say well I don't know
[1:16:53] I don't know where they're I'll ever get
[1:16:55] any better or not
[1:16:58] see I've been prayed for
[1:17:02] twice you might as well go home that's
[1:17:05] all but when you can cast that aside God
[1:17:08] don't want you to
[1:17:12] be everybody let your face know that
[1:17:15] quote
[1:17:19] now what are you frowning for trying to
[1:17:22] help make you laugh
[1:17:25] God don't want you
[1:17:28] frowning I need help us that little
[1:17:30] quote sometimes you ever brother's
[1:17:33] Zach now listen God wants you to be
[1:17:37] happy the human heart was
[1:17:39] made to be
[1:17:43] happy praise God worry will
[1:17:51] cause temper
[1:18:01] so for the safety of the preacher the
[1:18:02] preacher is moving behind the
[1:18:05] lesler temper will cause
[1:18:08] cancer and yet you will take that long
[1:18:11] finger yours and point at people to
[1:18:13] smoke cigarettes and say don't you know
[1:18:15] that devil is going to cause cancer
[1:18:16] inside your body and you've got enough
[1:18:18] temper to fight a buz saw and that
[1:18:21] temper inside of you is causing cancer
[1:18:23] come on now just like that cigarette
[1:18:25] smoke is causing cancer in them and it's
[1:18:27] disgusting to you to watch them put
[1:18:29] snuff down in the bottom of their lip oh
[1:18:31] my and you say don't you know that's
[1:18:33] causing glory of God I'll tell you one
[1:18:35] time that's causing cancer y'all go
[1:18:37] ahead and tell them why don't you tell
[1:18:39] them in your temper and in your anger
[1:18:41] that what you're doing is causing you
[1:18:43] cancer as well
[1:18:46] hey amen amen oh I may be down for a
[1:18:50] while I may be sad for a while I may
[1:18:53] have to let my face know for a while but
[1:18:56] I am a winner I am a conqueror I am more
[1:19:01] Hallelujah death will not Hold Us Down
[1:19:04] sickness will not hold us down the world
[1:19:07] will not hold us down we will
[1:19:10] overcome we were made to be
[1:19:15] [Applause]
[1:19:20] happy worry will cause cancer temper
[1:19:23] will cause
[1:19:26] cancer don't
[1:19:29] never be
[1:19:32] upset now you see to most of us this is
[1:19:35] just a really nice
[1:19:40] quote to me it should be a fulfillment
[1:19:43] in somebody's
[1:19:47] life just walk in his love knowing that
[1:19:50] you're walking in him and nothing
[1:19:55] can harm you there's nothing can harm
[1:19:57] you there's neither Powers no things
[1:19:59] present things future nothing that can
[1:20:01] separate us from him now brother B
[1:20:04] preaches a sermon called spiritual
[1:20:05] Amnesia only preaches it one time it was
[1:20:08] Birmingham 1964 but there's such
[1:20:11] astounding statements in here let me
[1:20:12] just share a couple with you here now
[1:20:14] this Amnesia we told it can cause you to
[1:20:18] a place where you
[1:20:20] cannot identify yourself
[1:20:25] now maybe some of you have had family
[1:20:27] members or friends or people that you've
[1:20:28] known that had
[1:20:30] Amnesia it can be brought on by a shock
[1:20:34] it can be brought on by an injury it can
[1:20:36] be brought on by different things that
[1:20:38] go on in the
[1:20:39] brain and the person after they begin to
[1:20:43] recuperate they still don't know who
[1:20:45] they are that must be a terrible thing
[1:20:47] so they look in the mirror and they
[1:20:49] don't know who they are and they look at
[1:20:51] people that they should know
[1:20:53] and that person said don't you know me
[1:20:55] don't you know me and you're saying I
[1:20:59] don't don't you know me you you you you
[1:21:02] we've been friends we're in the same
[1:21:03] don't you don't you know me I
[1:21:06] don't so should I know you should I I
[1:21:10] know you yes yes I'm your uncle son so
[1:21:13] I'm your brother I'm your sister I'm
[1:21:15] your
[1:21:17] mother and there's something
[1:21:20] missing the connection between you and
[1:21:24] them I want you to notice where you
[1:21:27] cannot identify yourself now it's an
[1:21:28] unusual thing don't happen too often but
[1:21:31] the caus this is from
[1:21:34] shock it's somebody that don't even know
[1:21:36] who they are and you find it from
[1:21:40] Wars but ain't no wonder so many of our
[1:21:42] folks have got it too look at the
[1:21:44] battles we're in you see it can come
[1:21:47] from
[1:21:48] Wars and Wars sometimes are War one and
[1:21:53] other times they're
[1:21:55] lost and it can come from I've seen it
[1:21:58] many times as Christians that will lose
[1:22:00] battles in this war and they become so
[1:22:04] tore up because this besetting sin or
[1:22:06] whatever it is just upsets them once and
[1:22:08] then another time and another time and
[1:22:11] they get to a spot they I don't even
[1:22:13] know if I'm bride or not right I don't
[1:22:15] even know if I'm elected looks like to
[1:22:17] me if I was elected I I i' I'd do better
[1:22:20] I I'd be better all right and then they
[1:22:23] go to entering into this this trauma of
[1:22:28] Amnesia and they forget who they are
[1:22:30] like they forget so much of what God's
[1:22:32] done for them and they forget he's the
[1:22:34] one to reach them down and pick them up
[1:22:36] and and WIP them off and and Sanctified
[1:22:39] him and gave him so many good things but
[1:22:41] it's like they can't they can't focus on
[1:22:44] it no
[1:22:47] more you find it from Wars sometimes
[1:22:49] soldiers get it sometimes people get it
[1:22:53] another thing causes
[1:22:56] it is
[1:23:01] worry so then a person can worry so much
[1:23:04] they actually get a spirit of worry on
[1:23:07] them and they worry and they fret and
[1:23:10] they fret and they worry and they're
[1:23:12] under such trauma and such sadness and
[1:23:14] such difficulty and little by little day
[1:23:17] by day they begin to lose their identity
[1:23:20] of who they are as a son or daughter of
[1:23:22] God God and it becomes such a Hal on
[1:23:25] them it's like they cannot shake
[1:23:30] it there's some powerful discernments
[1:23:32] that the prophet calls people out of
[1:23:34] course tells them different things but
[1:23:37] some of the ones that I I find so
[1:23:38] valuable myself are people that that
[1:23:41] would come up and one in my mind
[1:23:43] particular this morning I wouldn't think
[1:23:44] about speaking about it but a woman that
[1:23:46] comes up and he says you you've waited
[1:23:49] for a place where you could put your
[1:23:52] foot
[1:23:53] and people have told you get next to
[1:23:55] yourself get next to yourself and you've
[1:23:58] tried but you just can't do
[1:24:03] it but then he turns but I rebuke that
[1:24:08] spirit so now this person had entered
[1:24:11] into the stage of Amnesia and they tried
[1:24:14] and they tried and they couldn't do it
[1:24:16] notice he says worry has no virtue to it
[1:24:19] at all yeah just just skip worry worry
[1:24:23] and accept
[1:24:25] Faith skip worry and accept Faith
[1:24:28] someone said well now what if you were
[1:24:30] going to be shot in the morning wouldn't
[1:24:31] you worry I said no I don't think
[1:24:36] so why well I said worry couldn't do
[1:24:39] nothing but make me
[1:24:41] worse well what good is it to have faith
[1:24:45] I said it might deliver
[1:24:48] me it might deliver me and that's right
[1:24:52] now notice he said so worry has no
[1:24:54] virtue to it at all but faith has all
[1:24:58] virtue believe now worry sometimes
[1:25:00] causes it and another thing that cause
[1:25:03] among the people is getting between two
[1:25:05] opinions that'll cause
[1:25:09] Amnesia so getting between two
[1:25:12] opinions will cause
[1:25:15] Amnesia so people hear one idea about
[1:25:18] this and hear someone else come across
[1:25:20] with another idea about the same thing
[1:25:23] and then
[1:25:26] people now I don't know what to believe
[1:25:28] you know what happens an Amnesia strikes
[1:25:32] you and before you heard that opposing
[1:25:35] side you were settled you were oh I know
[1:25:38] exactly where I belong I know exactly
[1:25:40] where I stand I'm a Christian I'm in
[1:25:42] Christ Jesus I believe this word I'm
[1:25:44] part of the move of God and then someone
[1:25:46] else says something else you say well I
[1:25:50] mean I I mean I I thought I thought I
[1:25:52] was I thought I was okay I thought I
[1:25:54] believe this message I thought that I
[1:25:55] you know whatever it is and then they
[1:25:57] get to a spot but now I don't I don't I
[1:25:59] don't
[1:26:01] know Amnesia my brother
[1:26:06] sister PT s
[1:26:10] d post-traumatic stress
[1:26:13] syndrome what it call some heart
[1:26:17] battles hurt weariness
[1:26:21] exhaustion and then you don't know who
[1:26:23] you are and you don't know who anybody
[1:26:25] else is you don't know who your friend
[1:26:26] is you don't know who your enemies are
[1:26:29] can't trust
[1:26:31] nobody nine times out of 10 start
[1:26:34] drawing off to their s drawing further
[1:26:37] and further and further away oh I can't
[1:26:39] trust nobody can't trust nobody oh just
[1:26:41] get away from everybody I'm just going
[1:26:42] to stay home I ain't going nowhere I'm
[1:26:43] just going to stay home everybody leave
[1:26:44] me alone leave me alone you're falling
[1:26:46] right into the Trap Of The
[1:26:48] Devil God has a cure this morning for
[1:26:51] BTS
[1:26:58] D you imagine the prophet 1950 tells
[1:27:01] this individual whenever they come up on
[1:27:02] the platform all right
[1:27:05] sister don't worry about that cancer you
[1:27:09] got you got to be kidding me one of the
[1:27:12] most dreaded words for us as Mortals to
[1:27:15] hear I'm sorry to tell you this sir but
[1:27:17] you have cancer and yet you've got a
[1:27:20] prophet of God sting there telling them
[1:27:21] don't worry about
[1:27:23] it let me tell you this
[1:27:27] morning as Erica Reagan Parker's family
[1:27:31] members we saw a little woman that when
[1:27:35] she was diagnosed with it did not worry
[1:27:38] from day
[1:27:39] one until the end of her days on the
[1:27:44] earth now you may look at that and think
[1:27:46] but but it took her it did not he took
[1:27:51] her right that's right he took her he
[1:27:54] brought her here and he took her she
[1:27:58] left his presence as a thought but she
[1:28:02] went back under that altar as a
[1:28:04] manifested attribute alive she left his
[1:28:09] presence as a thought which had not yet
[1:28:11] come into expression but she lived on
[1:28:14] this Earth for 44 years in the last four
[1:28:17] she fought for her very existence she
[1:28:20] fought for her very life
[1:28:22] and she believed God's promise and I
[1:28:24] personally have seen her when the
[1:28:27] doctors would give her a terrible report
[1:28:29] one thing after another and she would me
[1:28:32] be sitting right there by her and get in
[1:28:34] the vehicle and take her home and she
[1:28:37] would life and say but God has the last
[1:28:40] word God has the last word so that is a
[1:28:44] daughter of God or a son of God that
[1:28:47] looks at God's promise and said devil
[1:28:50] not today not today devil oh Hallelujah
[1:28:54] I don't care if you're facing cancer I
[1:28:57] don't care if you're facing bankruptcy I
[1:28:59] don't care what you're facing today our
[1:29:01] God is bigger than every problem you got
[1:29:04] our God is bigger than your sin he's
[1:29:07] bigger than your sorrow he's bigger than
[1:29:10] everything you're going to I wish
[1:29:12] somebody would shout Glory with me this
[1:29:14] morning I God is a mighty
[1:29:20] God
[1:29:26] notice us through the services of this
[1:29:28] week trying to show people there's no
[1:29:31] need of being
[1:29:32] scared the worst
[1:29:35] thing the devil can put upon you is
[1:29:42] fear it's worse than cancer it's worse
[1:29:45] than TB it's worse than any disease the
[1:29:48] worst thing he can put on you is fear
[1:29:53] even if you even had a Cancer and you
[1:29:56] didn't fear and believe God but heal you
[1:29:59] you wouldn't been too bad as
[1:30:01] God take care of that if you're
[1:30:04] sick whatever it is if you didn't fear
[1:30:07] so fear is one of the worst things that
[1:30:09] Satan can place on a person now this
[1:30:12] week I've tried to prove by the
[1:30:14] scripture that that man that's born
[1:30:16] again of the kingdom of God
[1:30:20] has amen wonder why the angel of the
[1:30:23] Lord when he meets the prophet he could
[1:30:25] have named all kinds of
[1:30:27] diseases wonder why he only mentioned
[1:30:32] one and what was that one
[1:30:36] cancer not even
[1:30:39] cancer wonder why I didn't mention all
[1:30:41] the rest of them wonder why
[1:30:46] cancer there must be quite a devil ain't
[1:30:50] it but there won't be one devil that'll
[1:30:53] stand before our lord Jesus and be able
[1:30:56] to say nobody ever defeated me we've got
[1:31:00] people sitting right here today who have
[1:31:02] been healed by cancer some by Divine
[1:31:04] Healing some by Miracles I may believe
[1:31:06] God still heals cancer and he believes
[1:31:09] we're still going to pray with cancer
[1:31:11] for cancer patients with all of our
[1:31:13] heart come on somebody why because we
[1:31:16] believe our God can do it but brother
[1:31:18] Donnie what if the Lord takes them well
[1:31:20] if he does they walk that journey by
[1:31:22] faith and when it come right down to the
[1:31:24] end of it they could look the devil
[1:31:26] right Square in the face and say like
[1:31:28] Paul said the time of my departure is at
[1:31:31] hand I have been faithful I have been
[1:31:33] true Hallelujah I have Liv a Victorious
[1:31:37] overcoming life I did not fear cancer a
[1:31:40] child of God don't even fear death a
[1:31:43] child of God can look death in the face
[1:31:45] and say death you messed up today
[1:31:48] because all you're going to do is Carry
[1:31:51] Me home in the presence of God gu you
[1:31:54] are a
[1:32:03] loser Brothers Let's skip down the one
[1:32:05] quote there let's go to God's covenant
[1:32:07] with Abraham
[1:32:08] 1956 you got something wrong with your
[1:32:11] ear that's the bad part but there comes
[1:32:14] a dark shadow and you're
[1:32:18] scared
[1:32:19] cancer on the brain
[1:32:23] don't
[1:32:25] be
[1:32:29] scared
[1:32:31] don't how is that
[1:32:34] possible that the doctor can say you've
[1:32:38] got
[1:32:39] cancer on the
[1:32:48] brain it won't bother you now
[1:32:52] go on your road you're going to be all
[1:32:57] right why if you don't fear oh but
[1:33:01] brother Donnie the bombs you know the
[1:33:03] gbus and the this and that and the other
[1:33:05] and all that I know all of that's there
[1:33:08] but we've got a promise Hallelujah that
[1:33:11] before one of them ever go to hit us we
[1:33:15] will be
[1:33:17] gone why because we believe our God can
[1:33:21] I have a few more
[1:33:22] minutes notice with me in Psalm
[1:33:26] 2744 let's look at a principle of God
[1:33:29] that we as Believers look at his word
[1:33:31] and something that God requires of us
[1:33:34] wait on the Lord be of good courage he
[1:33:38] shall strengthen thine heart wait I say
[1:33:42] on the Lord sometimes we wait for
[1:33:45] healing sometimes we wait for
[1:33:47] deliverance and sometimes we wait for a
[1:33:50] perspective about his
[1:33:53] will now I'm G tell you how I feel about
[1:33:56] the Lord
[1:33:57] Jesus I prayed to God and God has told
[1:34:00] me yes I prayed to God and God's told me
[1:34:04] no I prayed to God and God has told me
[1:34:07] to wait a while but if I pray for
[1:34:10] something with all of my heart and I
[1:34:12] really want a yes but he gives me a no
[1:34:17] if no is his will in reality I want no
[1:34:22] even though my flesh may not want no it
[1:34:26] may break my heart how many has ever
[1:34:28] been there sure you have have you been
[1:34:29] say very long I hear the prophet say in
[1:34:31] 195 Last Story Lord you have broken my
[1:34:34] heart over and over again but I thank
[1:34:37] you for it because his NOS are just as
[1:34:41] important to me as his yeses if that is
[1:34:44] his will and I don't believe the will of
[1:34:46] God will ever lead you and I to a place
[1:34:49] that the grace of God will not keep us
[1:34:52] while we're in that place but what must
[1:34:55] we do we must wait on him amen notice
[1:34:59] again David says in Psalm 33:20 our soul
[1:35:03] waiteth for the Lord he is our help and
[1:35:06] our Shield Psalm 377 rest in the Lord
[1:35:09] and wait patiently for him fret not
[1:35:12] thyself because of him who prosper in
[1:35:15] his way because of the man who bringeth
[1:35:18] Wicked devices to pass psalm 79 for the
[1:35:22] evil goers shall be cut off but those
[1:35:25] that wait upon the Lord they shall
[1:35:29] inherit the earth Psalm 37:34 wait on
[1:35:32] the Lord and keep his way he shall exalt
[1:35:36] thee to inherit the land when the wicked
[1:35:38] are cut off Psalm 40 And1 to the chief
[1:35:41] musician of Psalm of David I waited
[1:35:44] patiently for the Lord patience and
[1:35:49] faith is not the same same
[1:35:53] thing millions of Christians have
[1:35:57] faith but only in the
[1:36:00] minority have
[1:36:03] patience come
[1:36:05] on you see
[1:36:07] God well let me just say it this this
[1:36:11] way I found it this morning the prophet
[1:36:14] said
[1:36:15] Believers are like
[1:36:17] change in your
[1:36:20] pocket in
[1:36:22] God's
[1:36:23] hand so he said you reach down in your
[1:36:26] pocket and you pull out pennies nickels
[1:36:29] times
[1:36:31] quarters silver
[1:36:33] dollars then it says lot was a
[1:36:36] penny he leaned toward the world he
[1:36:40] couldn't stick with the prophet in his
[1:36:41] message
[1:36:43] Abraham so he leaned toward the
[1:36:46] world and he was only a
[1:36:49] Pity but yet Abraham didn't
[1:36:51] throw him
[1:36:54] out and he said remember God can only
[1:36:57] use them in a penny
[1:37:00] way and they can only buy a Penny's
[1:37:02] worth of faith of course so they can go
[1:37:06] so far and maybe you're a a silver
[1:37:08] dollar and you look at them and say
[1:37:09] watch as plain as a nose on your face
[1:37:11] why can't you see this why can't you see
[1:37:13] that why can't you see this and you're
[1:37:15] able to purchase an entire 100 penny
[1:37:18] worth by your faith and and you're
[1:37:20] trying to reconcile and trying to
[1:37:23] fellowship and trying to talk to
[1:37:24] somebody that's all that'll ever be a
[1:37:29] Pity and they love the
[1:37:32] Lord a Penny's
[1:37:34] worth and then maybe you'll meet some
[1:37:36] it's a niichel worth and some of dime's
[1:37:38] worth and some a quarter's worth but if
[1:37:41] God's give you aund worth don't look
[1:37:43] down your nose at those it's only a
[1:37:45] penny cuz remember the key word was a
[1:37:47] prophet was says it was changed in your
[1:37:50] pocket but but it was in God's hand so
[1:37:52] where does it come from your pocket
[1:37:54] who's your pocket the church so the
[1:37:56] church is the one by which pennies
[1:37:58] nickels dimes quarters and dollars are
[1:38:00] found in the pocket so much of the
[1:38:02] church but the whole thing is what the
[1:38:05] kingdom of God and God is the one who
[1:38:07] drops that ability in a hearts of
[1:38:09] believe oh say glory to God I'll tell
[1:38:10] you one thing I know I'm aund I'm this
[1:38:13] and that and there man alive I'm this
[1:38:14] well if you are you ought to thank God
[1:38:17] cuz it's his grace to you cuz ain't none
[1:38:19] of us worth nothing noow even if you're
[1:38:22] a penny it's the grace of God if you're
[1:38:24] a silver dollar it's the grace of God if
[1:38:27] you're a dime if you're a nickel if
[1:38:29] you're a quarter come on somebody it's
[1:38:31] the grace of God some people will never
[1:38:34] be able to purchase a 100% worse of
[1:38:37] rapturing face they just see no need and
[1:38:42] sitting under the eagle anointing they
[1:38:45] see no need even though they're around
[1:38:47] the perimeter of it they see no need in
[1:38:50] preaching the message that they just see
[1:38:51] no need of it to them believing it is
[1:38:54] all they need to do they see no need in
[1:38:56] Reading quotes and and talking about the
[1:38:59] prophet and his message they see no need
[1:39:01] in
[1:39:02] it but if you're a silver dollar yes sir
[1:39:06] you realize you've got to be under an
[1:39:07] eagled anointing in order to fly out of
[1:39:09] here and it ain't enough just to believe
[1:39:12] it you want to share it so you want to
[1:39:14] share it on your Facebook account you
[1:39:16] want to share it in your emails you want
[1:39:18] to share it here some a lot of folks are
[1:39:20] secret belie
[1:39:21] they're going to wait I'm going Su I can
[1:39:23] what they're waiting for but one of
[1:39:24] these days they're going to tell
[1:39:25] everybody I reckon I just hope they
[1:39:26] don't wait too long to say you know what
[1:39:28] God sent a prophet and it's too
[1:39:32] late so God gives us the ability so some
[1:39:36] can believe Oh Glory to God I believe
[1:39:39] don't say they
[1:39:42] don't let them have their Penny
[1:39:46] walk let them use their Penny
[1:39:49] Faith let them use their Penny
[1:39:53] ability and if you're a dime don't look
[1:39:55] down your nose at them and said I'm 10
[1:39:57] times better than
[1:40:01] you or 25 or
[1:40:04] 100 But realize it's God's mercy to use
[1:40:09] silver
[1:40:15] dollar notice in Psalm 625 David said my
[1:40:19] soul wait only upon God for my
[1:40:24] expectation is for him Psalm 69:3 I am
[1:40:27] weary of my crying my throat is
[1:40:31] dried my eyes
[1:40:34] fail while I
[1:40:37] wait for my
[1:40:40] God you're talking about a man in
[1:40:44] desperation I am weary of my
[1:40:48] crying how many's ever cried to where
[1:40:50] you you thought I can never shed another
[1:40:53] tear whether it's for a loved one
[1:40:55] whether it's death or someone that walks
[1:40:57] away from the word whatever it is and
[1:40:59] you cry and you cry and you think I I
[1:41:02] just can't do
[1:41:03] anymore and somehow here comes another
[1:41:06] and another and another and David said I
[1:41:09] am weary of my crying my throat is dry
[1:41:12] the Hebrew word there is parched
[1:41:16] up burned
[1:41:19] enkindled and then
[1:41:22] inflamed so David had prayed and he
[1:41:25] prayed and he called on God until his
[1:41:28] throat was so
[1:41:30] sore and become
[1:41:33] inflamed and he couldn't even hardly
[1:41:35] talk
[1:41:38] anymore the great Gallant psalmist of
[1:41:43] Israel couldn't harly
[1:41:46] talk and it wasn't because he been to
[1:41:48] the Ball Game and it Shout Ed his voice
[1:41:53] out he was
[1:41:55] crying and
[1:41:56] praying and asking God for
[1:42:02] Mercy oh
[1:42:04] my by excessive exertion of his
[1:42:09] voice had become so
[1:42:11] parched his eyes failed because of
[1:42:16] exhaustion and his eyes were nearly
[1:42:19] swollen shut
[1:42:21] the way mine
[1:42:22] were a few days
[1:42:27] ago as I said in the hospital and cried
[1:42:31] and wept and cried and my eyes as I was
[1:42:34] there started swelling shut on
[1:42:37] me anybody ever been there so you know
[1:42:41] what I'm talking
[1:42:43] about and what do we do in such
[1:42:46] times we keep on
[1:42:49] waiting
[1:42:51] his power of
[1:42:53] vision had failed him but he said notice
[1:42:56] while I
[1:42:57] wait for my
[1:43:01] God Psalm 13:5 I wait for the Lord my
[1:43:05] soul does wait and in his
[1:43:08] word do I hope my soul waiteth for the
[1:43:12] Lord more than they that
[1:43:14] watch for the morning I say more than
[1:43:18] they that watch for the morning this
[1:43:20] would be pecul fcar to us because we
[1:43:22] don't have watchers
[1:43:25] anymore but you see living in a city the
[1:43:27] enemy was constantly trying to come in
[1:43:31] and they would have watchers during
[1:43:32] different watches of the night the three
[1:43:36] watches and they would
[1:43:38] watch and the worst one of course was
[1:43:41] the night watch which had broken up in
[1:43:42] two
[1:43:43] watches and they would wait for the
[1:43:46] Watchers to go to
[1:43:47] sleep and it must have seemed like the
[1:43:50] watch would would never end during the
[1:43:52] day it's easy to set up on the wall you
[1:43:54] got all the people hey John how you

[1:44:18] oh but if you go to sleep
[1:44:22] the enemy is watching
[1:44:24] you and if you leave you're post of
[1:44:29] Duty and the enemy comes in well you
[1:44:32] forsook your post you will answer to God
[1:44:37] because you were not where you were
[1:44:38] supposed to
[1:44:43] be you imagine how weary they must have
[1:44:46] been and David said I've sought you Lord
[1:44:49] I've waited I'm waiting for you more
[1:44:51] than the Watchers of the
[1:44:55] night oh
[1:44:57] God that keep the
[1:45:00] walls Psalm 123:2 behold as the eyes of
[1:45:03] servants look under the hand of their
[1:45:05] masters as the eyes of a m into the hand
[1:45:07] of her mistress so our eyes wait upon
[1:45:10] the Lord Our God until that he ha mercy
[1:45:13] upon us verse three have mercy upon us
[1:45:15] oh Lord have mercy upon us for we are
[1:45:18] exceedingly filled with contempt Isaiah
[1:45:20] 25 59 and it shall be said in that day
[1:45:22] Lo This Is Our God we have waited for
[1:45:25] him he will save us this is the Lord and
[1:45:30] we have waited for him and we will be
[1:45:32] glad and
[1:45:33] rejoice and his
[1:45:37] salvation now let us change here for
[1:45:39] just a moment and
[1:45:40] look to the powder keg of the
[1:45:46] earth look friends how fast this thing
[1:45:48] in Israel can change
[1:45:52] I took her a few weeks ago I said you
[1:45:53] watch what'll
[1:45:55] happen initially the world will stand
[1:45:57] with
[1:45:58] Israel But as time goes on and they
[1:46:00] start defending their ground and really
[1:46:02] going after that enemy it will change
[1:46:05] one after another after another after
[1:46:10] another if you've kept up with it is
[1:46:12] that's what happens don't you understand
[1:46:14] that's exactly the way he wants to do
[1:46:16] you so then if we attack our enemy
[1:46:19] worldliness if if we attack our enemy
[1:46:22] complacency if we attack our enemy lack
[1:46:25] of desire to go to the house of God one
[1:46:26] enemy after the other after the other
[1:46:28] and people say all they all the time
[1:46:30] just preaching on us they're just all
[1:46:32] the time preaching on us I'm trying to
[1:46:34] destroy your enemy spiritual
[1:46:38] Hamas and what does the devil want the
[1:46:40] preachers to do lighten up oh you just
[1:46:43] demanding too much of the people just
[1:46:45] preach good to them all the time tell
[1:46:47] them how good they are tell them how
[1:46:49] sweet they are well if you're more
[1:46:50] sweeter I tell you you're more sweeter
[1:46:52] if he more gooder I could preach more
[1:46:54] gooder come on but if you're lazy and
[1:46:57] complacent then don't pray and don't
[1:46:59] read your Bible how can you expect me to
[1:47:01] preach any higher than you live come on
[1:47:03] somebody and what does the devil want to
[1:47:06] do the devil wants to shut the mouths of
[1:47:09] those men of God who wants to go
[1:47:11] underground and dig out your spiritual
[1:47:19] Hamas
[1:47:21] so what is the cry over a
[1:47:25] 100,000
[1:47:27] people gathered in Washington
[1:47:31] DC was it
[1:47:33] outrage for babies that were
[1:47:36] beheaded was it outrage for people who
[1:47:39] were burned alive
[1:47:46] Jews praise the
[1:47:49] Lord it's almost like it's a one-sided
[1:47:52] deal I have the Jerusalem Post app on my
[1:47:56] phone had it for a couple
[1:47:58] years every day since this thing has
[1:48:02] happened I'm getting siren warnings on

[1:48:36] innocent people suffer but when you got
[1:48:39] these bunch of devils who plant their
[1:48:41] their headquarters right among the
[1:48:43] innocent people what in the world can

[1:49:02] on sin I'm going to preach against the
[1:49:05] spiritual homos I'm going to go
[1:49:07] underground if I have to and blast out
[1:49:10] their tunnels and do everything we can
[1:49:13] to destroy the headquarters of
[1:49:19] hell
[1:49:32] so what did prime minister b mean
[1:49:38] Netanyahu meet when Antony
[1:49:41] blinkin our highest ranking
[1:49:46] Diplomat whenever he met with him
[1:49:49] yesterday and said we need a
[1:49:53] ceasefire he said
[1:49:57] no that's exactly what OS
[1:50:00] wants get a ceasefire so they can
[1:50:02] regroup now don't just get Israel in
[1:50:04] your mind only look at your enemy what's
[1:50:07] he want me every other anointed man of
[1:50:11] God to bring a
[1:50:13] ceasefire let's let's get love let's
[1:50:16] quit preaching against the denominations
[1:50:18] and preaching against sin
[1:50:20] preaching against it we need new
[1:50:21] preachers need more love in your heart
[1:50:24] that's why I've got more love that's why
[1:50:25] I'm blasting that thing I love people I
[1:50:27] don't want them to go to hell I don't
[1:50:29] want them to go to wind up in hell if
[1:50:31] they do they're going to go to the top
[1:50:32] of my
[1:50:34] voice but what Satan calling for brother
[1:50:37] Joel a ceas fire right y'all quit firing
[1:50:40] y'all quit doing this and show
[1:50:45] love if I let you go to hell I don't
[1:50:48] love you amen
[1:50:52] amen I like Israel's
[1:50:55] tactics so what they did was they found
[1:50:57] one of the main entrances to one of the
[1:50:59] main
[1:51:00] tunnels and then they sent some of their
[1:51:03] Commandos in to draw Hamas
[1:51:08] out so when they drew them out then
[1:51:11] these other special unit which
[1:51:14] specializes in tunnel
[1:51:17] Warfare while they was out and gone
[1:51:20] these guys went right down in the middle
[1:51:22] of it took a bunch of pictures of all
[1:51:23] the information and hid in the tunnels
[1:51:27] and then whenever Israel come against
[1:51:29] them these other guys come back down in
[1:51:31] their safety
[1:51:33] zone
[1:51:35] ah but then they realize here's some
[1:51:38] Jews armed with
[1:51:41] ues and they Uzi caboo
[1:51:46] them well I tell I believe God's got
[1:51:48] some preachers to specialize in tunnel
[1:51:54] Warfare now needless to say some
[1:51:56] preachers are above ground and that's
[1:51:58] the only place they ever see they would
[1:52:00] know how to behave as they called them
[1:52:02] in the Vietnam War like a tunnel rat
[1:52:04] that's the name they gave them but there
[1:52:06] was men that the Viet Kong absolutely
[1:52:08] hated and it was men called tunnel rats
[1:52:11] and they would go down in them tunnels
[1:52:13] and they would flush the enemy out it's
[1:52:15] a dangerous deal cuz they got them booby
[1:52:18] trapped they had venomous snakes down in
[1:52:20] it they had all types of things but
[1:52:22] these men were trained to go down I'm
[1:52:24] glad God still got some men that know
[1:52:27] how to fight in the tunnels and they may
[1:52:30] go down where you and I ain't used to
[1:52:32] but thank God they're going down in
[1:52:33] there and flushing that devil out and
[1:52:36] here comes the devil Oh Glory to God get
[1:52:38] rid of that habit get rid of this temper
[1:52:40] get rid of this and that and the other
[1:52:42] and what's it do it flushes them out so
[1:52:44] these guys up on top can pick them off
[1:52:46] like flies thanks be to God for men of
[1:52:50] God that are willing to stand in this
[1:52:52] day and preach against evil and preach
[1:52:55] against darkness and preach against sin
[1:52:58] and also preach against
[1:53:01] fear and preach against our joy being
[1:53:04] taken from
[1:53:06] [Applause]
[1:53:09] us let's bow our heads
[1:53:13] together praise the
[1:53:16] lord lord Jesus we thank you today for
[1:53:19] your
[1:53:21] word forgive us
[1:53:24] father for being manipulated or
[1:53:27] controlled by ungodly
[1:53:31] fear help us I pray
[1:53:35] father Lord Jesus we're so
[1:53:38] grateful for lives that have lived Among
[1:53:41] Us I remember brother Junior Davis
[1:53:44] whenever he was going through his great
[1:53:47] battle and test of his faith
[1:53:51] Lord it was during that time frame and a
[1:53:52] little bit before that I was preaching
[1:53:54] about the
[1:53:55] confessions I would go to the hospital
[1:53:58] to see brother
[1:53:59] Junior and there at the foot of his bed
[1:54:01] no matter what room he was in there
[1:54:04] would be his little board that the
[1:54:05] family members had brought and it was
[1:54:08] his confession of
[1:54:10] Faith now no doubt some of them doctors
[1:54:12] and nurses and specialists in time they
[1:54:14] thought boy that guy sure missed it oh
[1:54:17] no he didn't miss it he was testifying
[1:54:20] of his confession of
[1:54:23] Faith
[1:54:25] Hallelujah and it was a great heroic
[1:54:28] deed I'm reminded of others that have
[1:54:31] posted their little signs here and there
[1:54:33] and
[1:54:34] there praise the Lord Karen brought one
[1:54:39] to
[1:54:40] Erica a few days before she transition
[1:54:44] from time into eternity it was a little
[1:54:46] sign set up on the
[1:54:48] wall
[1:54:51] something to the effect of then the
[1:54:53] miracle walked
[1:54:55] in well I have to be on the C I read
[1:54:58] that I thought yep yep that's what's
[1:54:59] going to happen the Lord's going to heal
[1:55:01] her body Miracle's going to walk
[1:55:04] in but the miracle that walked in wasn't
[1:55:07] the healing of her
[1:55:09] body but the healing from
[1:55:15] mortality
[1:55:18] Hallelujah
[1:55:20] as we heard her as she gasped for her
[1:55:26] breath we knew it wouldn't be long
[1:55:28] unless you
[1:55:30] intervened but the last one was
[1:55:34] taken and there was Silence from her
[1:55:38] body but little did we know she was only
[1:55:42] one breath
[1:55:44] away from Beth
[1:55:47] theophany praise God
[1:55:50] her little heart stopped
[1:55:54] beating oh I took her little precious
[1:55:57] hand in a few moments it was
[1:56:01] cold her fingernails started turning
[1:56:07] blue one of the most heartbreaking
[1:56:09] things I've ever
[1:56:12] experienced but he had I had to just
[1:56:14] keep consoling myself Donnie she's not
[1:56:17] there it's just a house

[1:56:23] house thank you Lord

[1:56:42] Bob we may have a few more we don't

[1:56:56] Jesus Satan don't want me to
[1:57:00] Cross no Satan don't want me to

[1:57:08] here Lord God may you anoint us with
[1:57:12] strength joy happiness may you anoint us
[1:57:17] as the army of God
[1:57:20] Lord as I saw a video the other day of
[1:57:22] Israel as they were gathered
[1:57:25] there before going into
[1:57:28] Gaza I hope the Bible readers here
[1:57:31] understand this is the exact same place
[1:57:35] where the Philistines were from
[1:57:39] Gaza the same area that Samson entered
[1:57:44] into the same area that David entered
[1:57:47] into and there was were some of David's
[1:57:51] sons and I watched them men as somebody
[1:57:54] turned on some type of Jewish
[1:57:57] music and before they went into the
[1:58:00] battle they started dancing before the
[1:58:04] Lord hallelujah
[1:58:08] hallelujah them men out there grabbing
[1:58:10] one another and dancing and screaming
[1:58:13] and
[1:58:14] hollering and someone had read a
[1:58:17] Psalm before they entered into the
[1:58:20] battle they was praising the
[1:58:23] Lord Lord God may we praise you before
[1:58:26] we get into it may we praise you while
[1:58:28] we're in it and may we praise you when
[1:58:31] we come out amen
[1:58:33] hallelujah we don't want to be the type
[1:58:35] of Christians that can only praise you
[1:58:37] when the battle's over we want to praise
[1:58:39] you before it ever starts we want to
[1:58:41] praise you when we're right in the
[1:58:42] middle of it and we sure want to praise
[1:58:45] you when we come through on the other
[1:58:48] side Lord God I pray for your tunnel
[1:58:52] Fighters I pray for those men who Step
[1:58:55] Up Lord and they risk their lives and
[1:58:58] hand toam
[1:59:00] combat your men of God around the world
[1:59:03] bless each one of them Father we need
[1:59:06] your men
[1:59:07] servants Lord in the last couple of
[1:59:09] years I've never seen such onslaught of
[1:59:12] Hell against the ministers and if Satan
[1:59:14] can't attack them personally they attack
[1:59:16] their family their wives their children
[1:59:20] it's unbelievable what's going on around
[1:59:22] the world Satan ain't attacking tape
[1:59:25] players he ain't attacking MP3 players
[1:59:29] he's attacking men of God like never
[1:59:31] before it shows us he knows where the
[1:59:35] thread
[1:59:37] is
[1:59:39] Hallelujah Lord God if I ain't nothing
[1:59:42] but a little
[1:59:43] Corporal if our church ain't nothing but
[1:59:46] just a little spot on the back side of
[1:59:48] the desert is as it
[1:59:50] was if I have to be a tunnel rat as it
[1:59:52] were Lord
[1:59:54] God if I've got to be a guy that carries
[1:59:56] the water or peels of ters don't make no
[2:00:00] difference to me whatever you want me to
[2:00:02] do I want to be a faithful Tater or
[2:00:04] peeler I want to be a faithful water
[2:00:08] hauler I want to be at my post of
[2:00:11] Duty and when the Rapture comes I want
[2:00:13] to be in the right place at the right
[2:00:17] time Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we
[2:00:21] love you Lord
[2:00:23] Jesus how many say today with me Lord
[2:00:26] God let me be at my post of Duty let me
[2:00:30] be faithful how many with me raise your
[2:00:32] hands to God as a living witness to
[2:00:33] heaven and hell today God strengthened
[2:00:36] me God help me hallelujah or some of you
[2:00:41] may never carry the banner some of you
[2:00:44] may never be a a commanding officer it
[2:00:46] was but maybe you're one of them like it
[2:00:49] was that held up the hands of Moses
[2:00:52] maybe you're one of them that's standing
[2:00:54] behind the men of God praying for them
[2:00:56] and you think that ain't important I'll
[2:00:58] tell you what it is very very important
[2:01:01] but each of us are called to do
[2:01:03] something
[2:01:04] friends
[2:01:07] Hallelujah would you lay your hands on
[2:01:09] one another would you
[2:01:13] mind dear father right now in the name
[2:01:16] of
[2:01:18] Jesus
[2:01:21] I pray that you'd help each of
[2:01:23] us I still don't think this
[2:01:27] church understands the value of their
[2:01:29] post of
[2:01:31] Duty I don't think most of us take it as
[2:01:34] serious as it
[2:01:38] is in the Civil War time if a person was
[2:01:41] placed to guard a certain
[2:01:44] post and they fell asleep or they just
[2:01:48] simply left their post of D and got out
[2:01:49] and wandered around a little bit from
[2:01:51] one post to another to another and the
[2:01:54] enemy came in and through that breach
[2:01:58] was able to kill several of their
[2:02:00] men that man was brought before the
[2:02:04] tribunal he was judged court marshaled
[2:02:09] and
[2:02:10] shocked because he left his post of Duty
[2:02:14] but somehow when it comes to the army of
[2:02:16] God people think they can just do
[2:02:18] whatever they wanted
[2:02:19] do well if I don't want to go to church
[2:02:21] I don't have to I'll do this I'll do
[2:02:23] whatever I want to do I wonder how many
[2:02:26] people are going to be judged when they
[2:02:28] stand before the Lord because they left
[2:02:30] their post of Duty at the beckoning of
[2:02:33] another person or because a feeling come
[2:02:37] over them and they thought they
[2:02:40] should Lord God help each of us at this
[2:02:43] church to realize no one can take our
[2:02:46] place no matter how small we think we
[2:02:49] are no matter how big we think we are no
[2:02:52] one can take our
[2:02:53] place and if we fail our post of Duty we
[2:02:57] will be held accountable before you Lord
[2:03:01] may we realize what a serious thing it
[2:03:03] is oh we've got so many of the message
[2:03:06] that ain't nothing but Church Hoppers
[2:03:08] they go from one to another to another
[2:03:11] to another and they don't realize one
[2:03:14] day they're going to be judged before
[2:03:15] almighty God help me Lord never to be
[2:03:19] one that'll Sher my
[2:03:21] responsibility help me Lord that I can
[2:03:23] stand faithful and when the trumpet
[2:03:25] sounds Hallelujah I will be found
[2:03:29] faithful at my post of Duty May every
[2:03:32] man woman boy and girl that belongs in
[2:03:35] our assembly father I pray you would
[2:03:38] shake them
[2:03:39] today help them Lord to realize what an
[2:03:42] important thing it is for them oh Lord
[2:03:46] to stand at their post and realize no
[2:03:48] one can take their
[2:03:50] place not only that but what a thing
[2:03:53] each of us have to answer for I have to
[2:03:56] answer that day Lord for many many Souls
[2:03:59] God help
[2:04:01] me but help these people to realize it's
[2:04:04] not just me that has to answer but they
[2:04:07] also have to answer they'll answer for
[2:04:12] that post that you gave them every
[2:04:14] preacher that's been here with
[2:04:16] us whether they are here or godone on
[2:04:19] they will have to
[2:04:21] answer every one of us Lord the claim we
[2:04:23] believe this message we will have to
[2:04:26] answer oh God may we be
[2:04:30] faithful may we be true Lord the call in
[2:04:34] the land is
[2:04:38] ceasefire ceas
[2:04:42] fire but we know how the devil plays
[2:04:47] ceasefire he only wants us to cease
[2:04:53] fire we don't make no deals with the
[2:04:58] devil so we ain't ceas firing as a
[2:05:01] matter of fact we're going to let him
[2:05:03] have it more than we've ever let him
[2:05:05] have it before we're going to bring out
[2:05:07] our GBU bombs we're going to bring out
