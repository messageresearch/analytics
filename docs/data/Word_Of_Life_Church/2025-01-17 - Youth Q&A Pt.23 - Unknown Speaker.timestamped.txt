[18:20] Lord trust you're well and everybody's
[18:23] happy serving the lord we will uh pick
[18:27] up on the question that we've been
[18:29] dealing with for a few
[18:30] Services can you explain why brother
[18:33] brandham is a Vindicated Prophet why the
[18:36] message is correct I have a difficult
[18:40] time speaking to why I
[18:43] believe what I believe let's just bow
[18:47] our heads together now and just ask the
[18:48] Lord to help
[18:50] us Lord Jesus we're so grateful as we
[18:53] were just singing this beautiful song
[18:57] Lord we are here to worship you
[18:59] tonight but Lord when we really
[19:02] understand what worship is we know that
[19:05] we don't have to wait to be in church to
[19:07] worship your Prophet has taught us that
[19:10] we can actually worship when we are
[19:13] witnessing about you to others whenever
[19:16] we're doing things in our everyday life
[19:19] it's a worship to God and that's the
[19:22] kind of people that we want to be to
[19:26] where that when we come to church we
[19:28] truly do worship but understanding has
[19:31] been enlightened and broader than what
[19:35] it was many many years ago to know that
[19:38] every day of our life can be a worship
[19:42] Lord Jesus as we assembled here tonight
[19:44] to be able to try to understand more
[19:47] about you and more about your word I
[19:49] pray that you would help me Father help
[19:52] me to get out of the way shut my mouth
[19:54] to anything that would displease you
[19:57] Lord we pray that You' be mindful of of
[19:58] all the sick and the needy tonight Lord
[20:01] pray that you just bless each one that's
[20:03] put forth the effort to be here anoint
[20:05] your word and anoint our hearts I pray
[20:08] in the name of the Lord Jesus amen God
[20:11] bless you you may be seated if you'd
[20:13] like to read with me we'll turn also to
[20:16] Matthew chapter
[20:17] 26:56 and what we want to do tonight by
[20:20] the help of the Lord is to be able to
[20:22] take um a journey into the New Testament
[20:26] now the last time we dealt with this we
[20:27] was dealing with the
[20:29] the Old Testament and trying to lay it
[20:32] out to help you for those of you that
[20:35] want to broader understanding of why we
[20:38] do believe in a prophet and also to be
[20:41] able to see that it would settle your
[20:44] faith and I know for myself in studying
[20:47] all these as I've looked at all these
[20:48] scriptures so to be able to understand
[20:51] it better I've looked up every scripture
[20:53] that uses the word Seer s ER also the
[20:57] word Prophet singer prophets plural
[21:00] prophesied prophecy so you can imagine
[21:03] it's quite an extensive study but I
[21:05] enjoy doing it because it helps you to
[21:08] be able to understand even more so for
[21:10] me I don't have a question about it but
[21:13] it just broadens my understanding as an
[21:15] individual so if we could we will look
[21:19] tonight at Matthew 26 and start there
[21:21] and then we'll run it on over through
[21:23] the scripture and we'll see how far we
[21:26] get we might get done with this one
[21:27] question tonight because we have a few
[21:29] more yet to deal with notice now in this
[21:32] is Matthew that is writing about the the
[21:37] coming of our Lord Jesus and the
[21:38] prophecies that have been fulfilled in
[21:40] his life and all this was done that the
[21:45] scriptures of the
[21:47] prophets might be
[21:50] fulfilled so now this is the beginning
[21:54] of the Christian era you've heard me
[21:56] talk about it and I use the term
[21:59] judeo Christian most of y'all know what
[22:01] that is okay so judeo-christian is
[22:05] actually that our Christianity it is the
[22:08] foundation of it actually goes back to
[22:10] Judaism by which God had called Abraham
[22:14] and then as God called Abraham and the
[22:16] 12 tribes and dealt with them so then
[22:19] Christianity because the first
[22:21] Christians were actually Jews so they
[22:24] believe the Lord and then on the day of
[22:26] Pentecost it began to broaden out of
[22:28] course to receive the Holy Ghost so as
[22:31] Matthew now is writing and remember the
[22:32] Book of Matthew was written several
[22:34] years after these events had transpired
[22:37] so they're looking back in retrospect
[22:40] and they have an understanding and
[22:41] they're saying okay okay now we can see
[22:44] this that he came they didn't have this
[22:47] understanding whenever he was here
[22:49] because the Holy Ghost had not yet been
[22:50] yet given so they were arguing debating
[22:53] who's going to be the greatest whenever
[22:55] you're gone who's going to have the
[22:56] greatest Ministry who's going to be the
[22:58] biggest preacher and so on and they were
[23:00] still trying to identify who he was by
[23:04] the scripture so now after he's done
[23:06] come and they're writing all of this
[23:09] Matthew goes this far and says that all
[23:13] this was done that the
[23:15] scriptures of the prophets so they were
[23:19] actually calling the words and the
[23:24] writings of the prophets of the Old
[23:27] Testament
[23:29] scripture now that's pretty astounding
[23:32] so a prophet is not just another Bible
[23:36] commentator a prophet is not another
[23:40] television preacher he's not just a
[23:42] local Pastor in a church he's not just a
[23:46] local man that goes out and preaches on
[23:48] the street or something like that a
[23:51] prophet is totally different now I write
[23:54] down things too but what I write down
[23:57] are not scriptures
[23:59] every preacher in the message brother
[24:00] Joe writes down notes but they're not
[24:03] scriptures so you think now that Matthew
[24:07] on this side of the Cross after
[24:09] receiving the Holy Ghost began to look
[24:12] and see what what is termed as the Canon
[24:16] of the Bible the scriptures and that
[24:18] what the prophets were saying were
[24:21] actually
[24:23] scriptures now it says all this was done
[24:26] that the scriptures of the prophets
[24:29] might be fulfilled but you know when I
[24:32] read this Bible verse it makes me wonder
[24:36] how many people in the days of Ezekiel
[24:40] Jeremiah Malachi Hagi all the different
[24:43] prophets Zachariah uh the the Psalms of
[24:46] David whenever they begin to write these
[24:49] things and whenever they were living in
[24:51] that day did the people of that day take
[24:55] that as scripture
[24:58] or did they just take it as well you
[25:01] know Jeremiah he's so strange anyway I
[25:03] mean he come in into the king's court
[25:07] and he has this yoke upon his neck and
[25:11] it would have been a yoke that would
[25:12] have been very heavy very crude and he
[25:15] had his his hands up inside that yoke
[25:18] and he said thus sayeth the Lord you're
[25:21] going down to Babylon and then people
[25:23] looked at him and said are you crazy are
[25:26] you out of your mind we're the chosen
[25:28] people of God you're nuts man they let
[25:32] him down into a pit and he sunk up to
[25:35] his waist in the mud they had to drop
[25:38] his water and his food down to him they
[25:41] ridiculed him they laughed at him
[25:43] there's no way the majority of the
[25:44] people believe that these prophets words
[25:48] were scriptures what about Hagi 2:7
[25:51] whenever Hagi said that the desire of
[25:55] all the nations shall come what about
[25:57] whenever Isa Isaiah said Isaiah 7:14 a
[26:01] virgin shall conceive and bring forth a
[26:04] child Isaiah 35:3 the lame shall leap as
[26:08] in heart the tongue of the dumb shall
[26:11] sing all these prophets as they said
[26:14] these things but no doubt the people in
[26:17] their day there was very few of them
[26:19] that even believe what they had to say
[26:22] to be able to make them scriptures now I
[26:24] say that parallel about them so that we
[26:28] are precautious in the day we live in so
[26:31] you see after the prophet of God of our
[26:34] age has come and gone the sad part about
[26:38] it is we see many people that have been
[26:41] around the message and in time what do
[26:45] they do they begin to sort through his
[26:48] message and categorize what they feel
[26:51] like is inspired so this part was of God
[26:56] this part wasn't this part was was this
[26:59] part wasn't and then you think is that
[27:02] exactly what they done when these men
[27:06] were on the earth there's no way the
[27:09] majority of the people even in Israel
[27:11] beli Jeremiah was a prophet of God
[27:13] there's no way they believed Ezekiel all
[27:16] the rest of these men were they would
[27:18] have not give them the hard time and
[27:20] they were constantly rebuking them for
[27:23] their sins and then what did Satan do
[27:26] had false prophets that would come say
[27:28] oh it ain't that bad why you're the
[27:30] people of God yeah you're going down to
[27:33] Babylon but you're just going to be
[27:34] there two years but Jeremiah was the
[27:37] hard prophet he was the difficult one
[27:40] Jeremiah said
[27:42] 70 but the false prophet said
[27:45] to and he knows how many years they were
[27:48] there 70 why Jeremiah was the true
[27:52] prophet of God but did they believe what
[27:55] he was saying was the scripture
[27:58] they did not now here we are confronted
[28:02] with the same thing and it makes it so
[28:04] difficult for us to be able to try to
[28:07] understand it now watch but all this was
[28:09] done that the scriptures of the prophets
[28:11] might be fulfilled then all the
[28:14] disciples forsook him and fled Mark 1
[28:19] verse 2 as it is written in the prophets
[28:25] behold I send my messenger before thy
[28:29] face which shall prepare thy way before
[28:34] thee now here Mark is quoting from
[28:37] Isaiah 40 but he's also quoting from
[28:41] Malachi 3 this is why it gives it the
[28:43] plurality whenever he said the prophets
[28:46] but in the days of Isaiah what did they
[28:49] do to him laughed at him ridiculed him
[28:53] anybody know how he died they put him in
[28:56] a hollow log
[28:59] and sought him in
[29:01] two him screaming and
[29:04] crying for
[29:06] Mercy would they have ever believed that
[29:09] man was writing the holy scriptures no
[29:12] way no way they thought oh them them
[29:16] people's crazy why them prophets say all
[29:19] kinds of things and the sad part about
[29:21] it is it was not the Babylonians the
[29:25] Persians the cians many of the heathens
[29:29] it was
[29:31] Jews the people they were sent
[29:34] to I pray God helps us that we never do
[29:37] that to our
[29:39] Prophet as it is written in the prophets
[29:42] behold I send my messenger before thy
[29:45] face which shall prepare thy way before
[29:48] thee Luke 1: 69 now what I want you to
[29:52] understand tonight as we go through this
[29:54] how common that the term prophet and
[29:58] prophets was to the New Testament
[30:00] Christians and Believers and how strange
[30:05] it is to most Christians today and yet
[30:08] we are looked at because people hear
[30:12] that we follow a
[30:13] prophet I had one of my nieces to text
[30:16] me the other
[30:18] day and she said Uncle Donnie I cannot
[30:23] believe that I have been
[30:25] deprived from being able to text you and
[30:29] being able to have communication with
[30:33] you for all of these years now she's
[30:36] been estranged from me for many many
[30:40] years because another one of my family
[30:44] members told her that I worshiped
[30:48] brother brandom and that I really didn't
[30:51] preach but all I done was got up and
[30:55] reread brother brandom's sermons
[30:59] and she said I am so sorry that I
[31:02] believe that against you so I text her
[31:05] back and I said well I said we worship
[31:09] only one person in our church and his
[31:11] name is not William bradam it's the Lord
[31:14] Jesus Christ it is him who died for us
[31:17] it was him who raised from the dead I
[31:19] said but we do believe that God sent a
[31:22] prophet and his name was William
[31:24] brandham so she text me back in a few
[31:26] minutes and she said yeah I know that
[31:28] she said because I text Alicia and I
[31:31] asked her about it and Alicia told me
[31:34] the whole truth she said but why would
[31:37] this family member poison me against you
[31:41] why would they want to do that I said
[31:43] well I'm not sure but God will make them
[31:46] answer for it and I said I forgave them
[31:49] years and years ago of such a thing now
[31:52] why would it then that we would be so
[31:55] odd and so peculiar here it's like we
[31:59] read from another Bible but actually
[32:02] we're reading from the same Bible they
[32:05] read
[32:05] from but you know why it sticks out to
[32:08] you you know why it sticks out to me
[32:11] when I read it it's because as brother
[32:14] Homer preached about it last night we
[32:16] have the
[32:17] tutorship of the shepherd himself you
[32:21] see the same Lord Jesus that anointed
[32:23] these men and they wrote about the
[32:26] prophets is the same Lord Jesus
[32:28] that's opened our hearts to help us to
[32:30] see it's not odd and peculiar when I
[32:33] read my Bible I think it's so odd that
[32:36] theologians have studied the Bible for
[32:39] decades of their life and they are
[32:41] totally ignorant of God sent a prophet
[32:44] in the last day and you think how sad
[32:47] and here I am I know I'm ignorant I know
[32:50] I'm a dummy I didn't even complete High
[32:52] School H are you kidding me Carol told
[32:56] me yesterday she said you know God is so
[32:58] blessed she said you've been all over
[33:00] the world you've traveled to so many
[33:02] continents you've been here and done
[33:04] that she said what somebody ever told
[33:06] you that what would you believed I'd lie
[33:08] said I'd laughed at them me a little Old
[33:10] Kentucky hillbilly I didn't think I'd
[33:12] ever get out of the hills much less go
[33:15] around the world you got to be kidding
[33:17] me but it's amazing what God has in his
[33:20] mind for us don't you ever Bel what God
[33:22] may do for you now watch in Luke 1: 69
[33:27] he has raised up an Horn of salvation
[33:30] for us in the house of his servant David
[33:34] as he spake by the
[33:38] mouth now would you notice how Luke
[33:40] writes
[33:42] this he does not say
[33:46] mouths as in
[33:50] plural but
[33:52] Mouth
[33:54] singular he spake by the mouth
[33:58] of his holy prophets but when it comes
[34:01] to prophets he makes it plural but only
[34:05] one
[34:06] Mouse
[34:08] wow so I wonder whose mouse that was was
[34:12] it Moses Mouse and Jeremiah used Moses
[34:15] Mouse and Ezekiel used Moses mouth uh-uh
[34:19] it's only one Mouse you understand when
[34:21] brother Homer was up here last night
[34:23] speaking by the spirit of God you know
[34:25] whose mouse that was the Lord used
[34:28] brother Homer's big mouth he did he used
[34:31] that but what did you hear whenever you
[34:34] heard it I heard the Lord using a human
[34:37] being ain't that right so a true
[34:39] anointed servant of God they're still
[34:42] speaking by the mouths of the Lord this
[34:44] is why the prophet tell us in the church
[34:46] age book the final voice to the final
[34:49] age will be in the bride of Christ is
[34:52] that right so it's just one mouth every
[34:55] true anointed servant of God is speaking
[34:58] by the mouths of the Lord I I love the
[35:00] way that the authors would pin this as
[35:02] he spake by the mouths of the Holy
[35:04] prophets which have
[35:07] been since the world
[35:10] began wow you mean so here is Luke this
[35:15] is written around 50 60 AD something
[35:18] like that and Luke makes this reference
[35:21] that the prophets were all the way back
[35:26] since the world began
[35:29] so why is it that people find it so
[35:31] strange that God would still use one in
[35:33] this day let me tell you why Creeds and
[35:36] dogmas and traditions have kept them
[35:40] away from it look in verse 71 that he
[35:44] would sa be saved from our enemies and
[35:47] from the hand of all of them that hate
[35:50] us Luke again chapter
[35:53] 18:31 then he took unto him the 12 and
[35:56] he said unto him behold we go up to
[36:00] Jerusalem and all things that are
[36:03] written by the prophets concerning the
[36:07] son of man shall be accomplished so
[36:11] here's the Lord Jesus and he setting an
[36:14] example now to the preachers that's
[36:17] going to preach now these these
[36:20] preachers have never preached before at
[36:22] all the priest never preached in the Old
[36:26] Testament so the these preachers need an
[36:29] example and Jesus has given them an
[36:32] example on how to preach the gospel you
[36:36] know the example that he gives them he
[36:38] wants them to make reference back to
[36:42] what the prophet said so I think about
[36:45] it the first books that were written in
[36:47] the New Testament were written around
[36:51] 55
[36:52] a so the Holy Ghost came and around 33
[36:57] to 34
[36:59] ad so what did they preach from 34 ad to
[37:05] 59
[37:08] ad what books did they read
[37:11] from oh brother Donnie the New Testament
[37:14] no there was no new
[37:18] testament so what did they
[37:21] quote the Old Testament prophets and the
[37:24] words that Jesus said and then the
[37:27] started quoting Peter James Bartholomew
[37:32] Thaddius Paul those oh my goodness you
[37:37] mean that they was quoting
[37:41] men you know I I just get I just I can't
[37:46] keep from laughing sometimes because
[37:48] people that'll come and we've had so
[37:50] many visitors that have come uh since
[37:53] we've been in this new place and I'll
[37:54] watch them when I go to you know
[37:56] whenever I go to preaching and you you
[37:57] can tell by looking at them when they're
[37:58] dressed and they're just visitors they
[38:00] ain't never heard nothing like this in
[38:01] their life there's a couple sit right
[38:03] here not long ago man and a woman and I
[38:05] watched them as I was playing the guitar
[38:07] and they was clapping their hands and
[38:08] you know swaying and all that stuff and
[38:11] I knew they didn't belong here and I
[38:13] thought well we'll see how long they
[38:14] last whenever I go to preaching so they
[38:16] was really into the singing really into
[38:18] the worship and all that and then
[38:20] whenever I started preaching I'm not
[38:22] going to alter what the Lord's put on my
[38:23] heart I'm going to preach what the
[38:24] Lord's given me so they sat turn there
[38:27] look back and forth back and forth at
[38:29] one another they sat there maybe 15 20
[38:31] minutes and they was gone they was out
[38:32] of here poor things there's no tell what
[38:34] they thought but you can imagine as as
[38:37] the first quote goes up on the screen
[38:39] and I thinking who is that man what what
[38:42] oh don't tell me but yet many of the
[38:45] Baptist Methodist Church of God Luther
[38:48] they'll refer back to Luther they'll
[38:51] refer back to George Whitfield they'll
[38:53] refer back to John Wesley Charles Wesley
[38:56] they'll even quote Charles Stanley they
[38:59] will quote you know James Dobson they'll
[39:02] quote this man that man that man and
[39:04] I'll say oh my goodness so why is it
[39:07] they look at us and think we are so
[39:10] weird when their own preachers do the
[39:12] same thing but one major difference is
[39:15] we're quoting from a Vindicated prophet
[39:19] and they are quoting from a theologian
[39:20] and some of those men had some very good
[39:23] things to say but aren't you glad we're
[39:26] sitting under a prophetic
[39:28] Ministry now watch again in Luke
[39:31] 24:25 the Lord Jesus after he raises
[39:35] from the dead then he said unto them oh
[39:38] fools and slow of heart to
[39:43] believe oh my goodness all the
[39:48] prophets have
[39:50] spoken now remember before he dies he
[39:54] refers them to the prophets after he
[39:56] raised from the dead he still refers
[40:00] them to the prophets in verse 27 and
[40:04] beginning at
[40:07] Moses and all the prophets he expounded
[40:13] unto them and
[40:16] all oh my goodness oh no no no no no
[40:21] no you mean to tell me
[40:24] Jesus
[40:26] believed what what the prophet said were
[40:34] scriptures
[40:35] wow I don't feel so weird I feel right
[40:39] at home I feel right at home you know
[40:42] what that makes me believe I am I'm a
[40:45] Jesus
[40:46] man I'm a Jesus
[40:49] follower I'm preaching the way Jesus did
[40:53] cuz
[40:54] Jesus quoted the
[40:58] prophets praise the Lord sir don't let
[41:01] people out here intimidate you all don't
[41:04] let them oh they're ignorant sure but
[41:07] don't let them intimidate you because
[41:09] you go to this skirt church we don't
[41:13] deny that even our piano wears a skirt
[41:17] brother they want to ridicule us laugh
[41:20] at us let them do it we don't care they
[41:23] call us odd and peculiar because we
[41:25] quote the prophets we we preach like
[41:28] Jesus that's what he done that's what
[41:30] the apostles done now you imagine when
[41:33] Paul begin to write and Paul told them
[41:36] when they received that certain letter
[41:38] and he said now you all read this letter
[41:41] and then you also read the letter from
[41:44] leosia which we don't even have that
[41:48] letter so it must have got lost
[41:50] somewhere down through time so you know
[41:53] what they were doing they were quoting
[41:55] from Ezekiel Jeremiah Hagi Malachi
[41:57] Zachariah Moses all that and then
[42:01] whenever the prophet Paul was there he
[42:03] would write them letters and they'd
[42:04] start sharing them letters so it would
[42:06] be like that our church would get a
[42:09] letter and then would say oh my goodness
[42:11] that is so good and then we'd want to
[42:14] share it with the church over in Irwin
[42:16] and and share it with you know brother
[42:18] Bill and these other churches around
[42:19] here and they would say oh somebody told
[42:22] me that brother R Spencer's Church they
[42:24] got another letter from from the church
[42:26] at IPI and would say brother Malachi the
[42:30] next time y'all go up there to visit
[42:31] your family see if they'll let you B
[42:33] borrow that letter and what we'll do
[42:35] we'll send you the letter we got from
[42:38] you know from
[42:39] cesaria and then all the preachers
[42:41] brother Ron say oh Church oh we got
[42:44] something exciting brother Malachi is
[42:47] coming up to visit in a few days and
[42:48] he's going to be bringing a letter that
[42:51] Paul
[42:53] wrote how blessed we
[42:56] are when you have
[42:58] access to the message of the hour right
[43:01] on your
[43:02] phone do you realize how blessed we are
[43:05] to live in this age we are the only age
[43:09] that had the ability to hear the literal
[43:12] voice of our
[43:14] messenger those that didn't live in the
[43:16] days when Paul was alive all they had
[43:19] left was written
[43:21] words in the days of all the rest of
[43:23] those Church aged Messengers but God has
[43:26] made a way where we can hear that voice
[43:29] I am so grateful I've been hearing it
[43:32] today I heard it for hours yesterday and
[43:34] the day before and the day before been
[43:37] listening to it again today over and
[43:39] over again I love it myself we are so
[43:43] blessed notice in Jesus again beginning
[43:47] at Moses and all the prophets expounded
[43:50] unto them in all the
[43:54] scriptures the things con
[43:59] concerning
[44:03] himself now you imagine after those
[44:07] words have now been
[44:10] fulfilled the Lord Jesus now the
[44:14] setting is on the way to
[44:18] emus so the disciples are going along
[44:21] they're so tore up they thought oh that
[44:23] they thought Jesus was the one but then
[44:26] he he was crucified and died and and
[44:30] they're they're just going around
[44:31] they're so sad and they're just so tore
[44:33] up and Jesus joins himself to him and
[44:37] said where y'all
[44:39] going and he said oh we we just we we've
[44:42] been we've been talking about these
[44:44] things he said these things that's
[44:46] happened and Jesus said what
[44:49] things what things so they said Jesus
[44:53] the son of God and we thought we we
[44:57] thought look at them now they're not
[45:00] even sure aren't you glad Jesus don't
[45:03] get mad at us when we have questions and
[45:06] things that we don't understand well
[45:08] Michael there they're just been honest
[45:10] and open we thought it was him but now
[45:13] we're kind of having doubts about it
[45:15] we're just we're just not sure so Jesus
[45:18] didn't get mad and said you bunch of
[45:20] serpent eat you you go back down there
[45:22] and get saved when you get saved then
[45:23] I'll talk to you but he wanted to help
[45:29] he saw they had
[45:32] questions and Jesus didn't take about a
[45:34] 15 minute sermon it as a matter of fact
[45:38] the prophet tells us it was actually
[45:39] several hours on that way a six-hour
[45:44] sermon on Prophecy don't worry I ain't
[45:48] preaching that long I've got my timer
[45:49] set on my iPad and I'm watching it close
[45:52] but can you imagine a 6-hour sermon on
[45:56] Pro
[45:57] prophecy and may went back to the ti of
[46:00] Abel and the
[46:02] lamb and the Redemption money at the
[46:06] Tabernacle and here they are walking
[46:08] along the
[46:10] way and once again Jesus given the
[46:13] example to cleopas and his friend and
[46:17] they come to an end and it was getting
[46:19] late and Jesus acted like he was going
[46:23] to go
[46:25] on you know this Friday ens me a little
[46:29] bit because I think I wonder how many
[46:32] times that
[46:33] Jesus may act like he's going to just
[46:37] kind of bypass our service well it's
[46:39] just a youth service there ain't that
[46:42] many of
[46:44] us but I want to be one of
[46:48] them that I'll stop him don't you so
[46:52] they said would you come in and and
[46:56] break bread with us
[46:59] the time is far spent and it's evening
[47:02] time they still didn't know who he
[47:05] was so they go in and sit down and they
[47:08] order some bread maybe some drink of
[47:10] some
[47:11] sort and Jesus Takes the
[47:14] bread and he begins to break
[47:17] it and when he broke the
[47:20] bread their eyes were
[47:23] open and they knew who he was
[47:27] and he
[47:28] vanished out of their side what do you
[47:32] say we're
[47:34] here we've come by this end
[47:37] tonight so if Jesus acts like that he's
[47:40] going to go right on by what do you say
[47:43] that we say Jesus would you care to stop
[47:45] here with us tonight we've got needs
[47:48] we've got desires we we' got needs in
[47:51] our bodies needs in our understanding
[47:55] would you stop and stay with us for a a
[47:56] little while Jesus I believe you will
[47:59] don't
[48:00] you what a
[48:03] setting Luke 24:
[48:07] 44 and he said unto them these are the
[48:11] words which I spake unto you while I was
[48:13] yet with you but all things might be
[48:16] fulfilled which were written in the law
[48:18] of
[48:19] Moses and in the
[48:22] prophets and in the
[48:25] Psalms concerning in me what's he
[48:28] wanting them to see that he had a
[48:30] scriptural background and a scriptural
[48:34] identification this will give them fa
[48:37] now this is the foundation of the Gospel
[48:40] now remember these men are going to
[48:42] first start preaching to Jews why does
[48:45] he keep going back to the scripture he
[48:47] wants them to come out of there and be
[48:50] able to introduce their Jewish Brothers
[48:54] with a scriptural Foundation
[48:57] a mosaic Foundation a prophetic
[49:00] Foundation that they can point back and
[49:02] say Brothers this is what Jeremiah said
[49:05] this is what Zachariah said when he said
[49:08] the man whose name is the Branch b r a
[49:14] an CH the man that David was speaking
[49:17] about when God told him of the fruit of
[49:21] thy body will I set upon thy throne
[49:27] this is the man oh Oh you mean Oh you
[49:30] mean that this Jesus he he wasn't a
[49:32] renegade no that this was the very one
[49:36] that Moses said the Lord your God shall
[49:38] raise up a prophet liken unto me from
[49:42] among his Brethren and everyone that
[49:45] will not hear that Prophet will be cut
[49:47] off from among the people what do he
[49:49] want them to have a foundation what do I
[49:52] want to leave for you young people I
[49:54] want you to understand that we are not
[49:57] following a cult we are not part of
[50:00] something that is not scriptural we are
[50:03] part of something that starts Plum back
[50:05] from the foundation of the world and
[50:07] goes all the way to the Book of
[50:09] Revelation now notice which were written
[50:11] in the law of Moses and in the prophets
[50:14] and in the Psalms concerning me John
[50:18] 6:45 now here another writer of the New
[50:21] Testament it is written in the prophets
[50:25] they shall all be taught of God every
[50:28] man therefore that has heard and has
[50:30] learned of the father cometh unto me now
[50:33] John is is quoting Jesus in the book of
[50:36] Acts chap 3: 18 but those things which
[50:39] God before had showed by the mouth
[50:44] singular of all the prophets plural that
[50:48] Christ should suffer he has so fulfilled
[50:52] now watch so here we've got the apostles
[50:57] preaching look at the way they're
[50:59] preaching they're preaching after the
[51:02] manner that the Lord Jesus gave them so
[51:06] these apostles then they're not standing
[51:08] up and preaching and they take the first
[51:10] 30 minutes talking about
[51:13] themsel well I'll tell you one thing
[51:15] I've been fighting that Old Devil I
[51:17] don't know what in the world's going on
[51:20] I'm so persecuted I'm run down I'll tell
[51:23] one thing me me I I me me I
[51:27] no that's not what they preached they
[51:30] preached Jesus they preached in the same
[51:33] mannerism that mannerism was give it a
[51:38] scriptural Foundation now remember Jesus
[51:41] knew this gospel was going to go around
[51:44] and around the world these men are
[51:46] learning from the best preacher that
[51:48] ever lived so watch how they preached
[51:52] just like him and they took it right
[51:54] back to the scripture now notice by the
[51:57] mouth of all the prophets that Christ
[51:59] should suffer has he so fulfilled
[52:02] Revelation 3:21 or acts 3:21 rather whom
[52:05] the Heaven Must receive until the times
[52:08] of the
[52:09] restitution of all things now watch
[52:13] prophetically they know there's coming a
[52:15] time when all things will be restored
[52:18] you mean to tell me the Lord Jesus has
[52:20] come to the earth now been resurrected
[52:24] the Holy Ghost has come back on the day
[52:26] of Pentecost lost but they're talking
[52:28] about a time of
[52:32] restitution well when's that going to be
[52:34] you mean it wasn't then well according
[52:36] to them it wasn't whom the heavens must
[52:39] receive until the times of restitution
[52:41] of all things which God hath spoken look
[52:45] at the apostolic Foundation how they
[52:48] believed prophets spoke which God hath
[52:53] spoken by the mouth
[52:56] I'm sure you're seeing this pattern over
[52:59] and over again by the
[53:04] mouth of the Holy
[53:06] prophets plural since the world began
[53:11] verse 24 yay and all the prophets from
[53:14] Samuel and those that follow after and
[53:17] as many as have spoken have likewise
[53:21] foretold of these days acts 10:42
[53:27] he commanded us to
[53:29] preach unto the people unto testify that
[53:34] it is he which was ordained of God to be
[53:40] the judge of the quick and the dead so
[53:42] what are they doing they're preaching
[53:45] exactly the way Jesus told them to
[53:47] preach boys don't get up there and tell
[53:50] how many years you spent in school don't
[53:53] get up there and talk about yourself
[53:55] don't get up Turn Point the people to
[53:57] you but tell them about
[54:01] me praise the Lord ever God call man
[54:05] that's his great desire right now I
[54:08] could talk to you about me I've had
[54:11] several people ask me and my life of
[54:13] being a preacher why haven't you never
[54:16] given a life story my answer is always
[54:19] the same there ain't that much to say it
[54:22] wouldn't take me very long to say it I
[54:24] could say it in a few minutes that'd be
[54:25] the end of it why would I want to spend
[54:28] my time talking about me when I can tell
[54:32] you about the resurrection and the life
[54:34] and the Healer and the deliverer which
[54:37] would you rather hear about a man full
[54:39] of mistakes and error or a man that is
[54:43] almighty God himself the Lord Jesus I
[54:47] don't know about you sure I like hearing
[54:48] stories about this and that but don't
[54:50] waste my time trying to magnify some man
[54:53] somewhere some preacher somewhere tell
[54:55] me about the resurrection and the life
[54:57] you'll not find it being Apostolic
[55:00] Doctrine to take all of our time talking
[55:03] about one another Well Amen brother
[55:06] Donnie preach it brother Donnie I'm with
[55:09] you amen now notice to him give all the
[55:14] prophets witness that through his name
[55:16] whosoever believeth in him shall receive
[55:20] remission of sins now watch this in Acts
[55:25] 11: 27 and in these days
[55:30] came now wait a
[55:32] minute I thought the Bible said the law
[55:37] and the
[55:38] prophets were un
[55:40] John and then from that time the Kingdom
[55:43] of Heaven is preached and every man
[55:46] presseth his way into
[55:48] it now the Bible does actually say that
[55:52] but that scripture has been used to try
[55:55] to prove prove that we don't need
[55:59] prophets but was that what the apostles
[56:02] believed no CU now here they are living
[56:07] years after the law and the prophets
[56:11] supposedly done been
[56:13] fulfilled but yet this is the way the
[56:17] Apostolic Church what they had in their
[56:19] church and in these days came
[56:23] prophets oh my goodness more than one
[56:27] prophets from
[56:29] Jerusalem onto
[56:33] Antioch and the use of Word of Life
[56:35] Church
[56:37] said amen acts
[56:41] 131 now there were in the church that
[56:44] was at
[56:46] Antioch certain
[56:49] prophets and teachers as Barnabas and
[56:54] Simeon that was called Niger and Lucius
[56:57] of sirene and Mahine and which had been
[57:01] brought up with Herod the tetrarch and
[57:06] Saul so you mean in the Apostolic
[57:10] Church there was prophets
[57:14] wow well I wonder what they done what
[57:18] did these prophets do were they
[57:21] different than Apostles apparently were
[57:23] they different than pastors they were
[57:26] were they different than Mark Mark was
[57:30] an evangelist were they different from
[57:32] him yes look in Acts
[57:35] 13:27 for they that dwell at Jerusalem
[57:37] and the rulers because they knew him not
[57:40] nor yet the voices of the prophets so
[57:43] now you imagine we're not actually
[57:45] living in 2025 we're going to go back in
[57:48] time and we're in the first
[57:50] century we're in the first century so I
[57:54] would be standing up in a cave and a
[57:57] catacomb and a little small building and
[58:00] I would be preaching to the Youth of the
[58:03] first century what would I be quoting I
[58:06] would be quoting about Moses and
[58:08] Jeremiah and Ezekiel but because I've
[58:11] got the Holy Ghost I will all also be
[58:16] updated and I'll be quoting from Paul
[58:19] and I will be acknowledging in the
[58:22] church that there is a man by the name
[58:26] of
[58:28] agabus and agabus is not a prophet like
[58:32] a church AED
[58:34] messenger but he is a man that stands up
[58:39] and
[58:41] prophesies and what he says comes to
[58:46] pass y'all remember reading about agabus
[58:49] in the New Testament some of you do some
[58:51] of you don't all right so Paul comes up
[58:54] to this certain City where agabus is so
[58:59] agabus gets Paul's garment and he takes
[59:03] it over and he binds Paul up with it
[59:06] takes it to Paul and he says now he had
[59:09] never met Paul he didn't know him
[59:10] physically so whoever owns this garment
[59:15] this man is going to Jerusalem and he's
[59:18] going to be
[59:20] bound so he didn't say something that
[59:23] nobody understood he didn't say
[59:26] something that could be taken either way
[59:30] but it was very descriptive and it was
[59:33] very
[59:35] definite that's a true Prophet now watch
[59:38] this in verse 32 of chapter 15 and
[59:43] Judas and Silas now this is not
[59:47] Judas is
[59:49] scariot but another
[59:52] Judas and Judas and Silas
[59:56] being
[59:58] prophets also themselves exhorted the
[1:00:01] Brethren with many words and confirm
[1:00:07] them
[1:00:08] wow so now here we are in Acts chapter
[1:00:12] 15 this is
[1:00:14] years after John the Baptist is done
[1:00:17] gone and yet the Apostolic Church
[1:00:21] believed in New Testament prophets
[1:00:25] praise the Lord
[1:00:27] acts
[1:00:29] 24:14 but this I confess unto thee that
[1:00:31] after the way which they call heresy so
[1:00:35] worship I the god of my fathers Paul
[1:00:37] here speaking believing all things which
[1:00:41] are written in the
[1:00:43] law and in the
[1:00:46] prophets so you see if we were New
[1:00:48] Testament Christians and you were the
[1:00:51] use of the New Testament Church to
[1:00:55] believe in prophet phets would be so
[1:00:58] commonplace to you because every time
[1:01:01] the preachers would get up to preach
[1:01:03] they'd say the prophet Moses said the
[1:01:05] Prophet Jeremiah said the prophet
[1:01:08] Zachariah said the prophet Hagi said the
[1:01:11] prophet Malachi said and then they'd say
[1:01:14] and God sent his beloved brother Paul a
[1:01:18] prophet of God with the word of this age
[1:01:20] and Paul wrote to the Corinthian Church
[1:01:23] that they are not to speak in tongues
[1:01:26] just out open in the church that they if
[1:01:29] there's no interpreter let them hold
[1:01:31] their peace oh my goodness you mean you
[1:01:34] all are quoting what Paul said yes we
[1:01:37] are and the Beloved brother Paul said
[1:01:41] that women are to remain silent in the
[1:01:43] church and the Beloved brother Paul now
[1:01:46] wait a minute wait a minute wait a
[1:01:47] minute I'm going to check out Paul by
[1:01:50] the Old
[1:01:51] Testament and I want somebody to show me
[1:01:55] in the Old Testament where the Old
[1:01:58] Testament Prophet said a woman had to
[1:02:00] remain silent in the
[1:02:02] church I'm going to check Paul tonight
[1:02:05] with the
[1:02:11] scriptures well if you're going to make
[1:02:13] that
[1:02:14] approach let me just tell you in advance
[1:02:16] what you're going to do you're going to
[1:02:18] make a fool out of
[1:02:20] yourself cuz the Old Testament never
[1:02:22] said that but I want you to notice what
[1:02:25] Paul did 1 Corinthians 14:34 so let your
[1:02:28] women keep silence in the churches as
[1:02:32] also sath the
[1:02:35] law now if you find me where the law
[1:02:38] says it I'll eat this
[1:02:42] Pulpit it'll take me a while but I'll
[1:02:44] eat it but I feel safe because I've done
[1:02:48] looked it don't say
[1:02:53] it oh my goodness
[1:02:57] so what was Paul
[1:02:59] quoting he was quoting The
[1:03:03] Silence of the
[1:03:06] law you ever wonder if women can be
[1:03:10] pastors why there are no requirements
[1:03:13] for a woman
[1:03:15] Pastor now there are for
[1:03:18] men so let the man that desires the
[1:03:21] office of a bishop he desires a good
[1:03:23] thing and he has to be the husband of
[1:03:26] one
[1:03:27] wife so because the scripture gives no
[1:03:32] scriptural
[1:03:33] identification so a woman who desireth
[1:03:36] to be a
[1:03:39] pastoret or whatever her pronoun is to
[1:03:42] be a woman Pastor so she must be the
[1:03:45] wife of one husband she cannot be a
[1:03:50] polygamist because the scripture gives
[1:03:53] no requirement for a woman preacher 1
[1:03:56] Corinthians 14:34 or 1 Timothy 2:12
[1:03:59] would not even have to be written
[1:04:02] because there is no identification to
[1:04:04] describe her office so Paul said there
[1:04:08] is no scripture in the Old Testament
[1:04:11] where it said let the
[1:04:13] Priestess it was Idol worshippers who
[1:04:16] had
[1:04:17] priestesses not children of God so Paul
[1:04:21] quoted The Silence of the law and use
[1:04:24] that as a reference that no doubt that
[1:04:25] there were people in that day that said
[1:04:27] Paul said wow Paul where did you get
[1:04:30] that at there's some things that Paul
[1:04:33] wrote in the New Testament not another
[1:04:35] one of the writers
[1:04:38] said I thought the Bible said let every
[1:04:41] word be proven by two or three
[1:04:47] Witnesses oh my goodness why are y'all
[1:04:49] so quiet on me tonight cat got your
[1:04:52] tongue even brother Joe was quiet
[1:04:56] so I guess my question is for some of
[1:04:59] the preachers in the message that think
[1:05:01] they are so much smarter than our
[1:05:04] prophet and if they don't go along with
[1:05:06] certain things that he preached they say
[1:05:07] well I don't see that in the
[1:05:10] scripture I'm going to give brother
[1:05:12] brandom a word test and if I can't find
[1:05:14] it in the scripture then I ain't going
[1:05:16] to believe it you're making an idiot out
[1:05:19] of yourself I don't care if you've
[1:05:20] preached 138 years you're exalting
[1:05:24] yourself above a Vindicated Prophet what
[1:05:29] if God gave him that and it is a word
[1:05:33] from
[1:05:34] God and then we will exalt our own
[1:05:39] intelligence above a
[1:05:41] word from God you see what we would do
[1:05:44] exactly what they did in the days of
[1:05:47] Jeremiah Ezekiel
[1:05:50] hagga
[1:05:53] zakari if it comes right down to it
[1:05:56] but and it's even
[1:05:59] opinion this is where your pastor stands
[1:06:02] so nobody would have to worry about it
[1:06:05] even if it's opinion I'll take brother
[1:06:07] brandom's opinion over my own sir or
[1:06:11] over any other preacher as far as that
[1:06:13] goes because you know what I've never
[1:06:16] been privileged to walk with God the way
[1:06:18] he did nor has any other man in this
[1:06:23] age John saw Seven Stars in the right
[1:06:28] hand of Jesus not 37 47
[1:06:34] 397 but seven so those men had a special
[1:06:38] place with God I will never have that
[1:06:43] neither will any other man now there's a
[1:06:45] lot of men that feel like they are there
[1:06:48] but I'm sorry well no really I'm not
[1:06:50] John did not see an eighth star a ninth
[1:06:54] star a 10th star star a 47th star you
[1:06:58] only saw
[1:07:01] seven now think are we
[1:07:05] Apostolic if we leave out prophets from
[1:07:10] our church are we Apostolic if we leave
[1:07:14] out God sending a prophet with a message
[1:07:18] we're not Apostolic because they
[1:07:20] believed in
[1:07:22] prophets can I go on a few more minutes
[1:07:27] can I go on a few more
[1:07:29] minutes okay brother Homer said y'all
[1:07:31] was the noest bunch of people ever seen
[1:07:33] in his
[1:07:36] life now watch in Acts 28:23 and when
[1:07:39] they had appointed him a day there came
[1:07:41] many to him in his lodging to whom he
[1:07:44] expounded this is Paul testified the
[1:07:48] kingdom of God persuading
[1:07:51] them
[1:07:53] concerning Jesus
[1:07:56] both out of the law of
[1:07:59] Moses and out of the prophets listen how
[1:08:03] long he did
[1:08:05] it from
[1:08:08] morning till
[1:08:11] evening
[1:08:12] wow that must have been a hungry bunch
[1:08:15] of
[1:08:17] people you see why they were following
[1:08:19] the
[1:08:21] example of the Lord Jesus to include the
[1:08:25] prophet
[1:08:26] Romans
[1:08:28] 16:25 now to him that is of power to
[1:08:31] establish you
[1:08:35] according no
[1:08:37] way no way this man is going to say
[1:08:40] these
[1:08:41] words establish you
[1:08:45] according to my
[1:08:50] gospel you mean Paul is going to
[1:08:53] assert this
[1:08:55] in the
[1:08:57] Bible and call this his
[1:09:03] gospel I have no problem in saying Amen
[1:09:05] to that
[1:09:07] you now to him that is of power to
[1:09:11] establish you according to my gospel and
[1:09:16] the
[1:09:18] preaching of Jesus
[1:09:20] Christ according to the revelation of
[1:09:23] the mystery which have was Kept Secret
[1:09:27] since before the world began but is now
[1:09:30] made
[1:09:31] manifest and by the
[1:09:35] scriptures of the prophets young people
[1:09:39] is it not amazing how many times that
[1:09:42] your
[1:09:44] Bible
[1:09:45] identifies the words of the
[1:09:49] prophets as
[1:09:53] scriptures you might wonder why
[1:09:56] that a preacher would get so
[1:10:00] nervous and as you know I've been
[1:10:02] preaching since I was 18 years old and
[1:10:06] I'm
[1:10:07] 68 so this is my 50th year in March
[1:10:12] would be 42 years maybe something like
[1:10:15] that since I've been in the
[1:10:17] message if you could have a little
[1:10:21] camera inside the steud there
[1:10:25] and while Brother Lou is leading the
[1:10:26] singing specials are going on or before
[1:10:29] service starts and I'm back there by
[1:10:32] myself and I'm walking the floor and I'm
[1:10:35] praying oh Jesus please help me Lord
[1:10:38] please help me I don't say nothing wrong
[1:10:40] please help me
[1:10:42] God and people say brother Donnie you
[1:10:45] you still get nervous and I say you
[1:10:47] ought to see me I said really after all
[1:10:50] these years I mean why would you get
[1:10:53] nervous
[1:10:56] because I realize I'm going to have to
[1:10:58] stand before God I'll have to stand
[1:11:01] before God for this service
[1:11:05] tonight and if I mislead one person if I
[1:11:09] would take scriptures or quotes and put
[1:11:11] them together or if in my studies I
[1:11:15] would find several quotes and they
[1:11:18] actually say opposite from what I'm
[1:11:22] trying to
[1:11:23] project and I just kind of leave them
[1:11:28] out because in
[1:11:30] reality that would give you a different
[1:11:35] thought but because it don't go along
[1:11:38] with my thought then I'll said well I'll
[1:11:40] just you know I just kind of leave that
[1:11:42] out that really it's not that's not my
[1:11:45] thought now I study weird okay I study
[1:11:48] weird God gives me a thought by
[1:11:51] inspiration of the spirit of God I might
[1:11:52] be driving down a road I might be
[1:11:54] listening to a tape um I might wake up
[1:11:56] 3:00 in the morning whatever he he gives
[1:11:59] he deals with me in different ways and
[1:12:01] then I will take that thought and start
[1:12:04] looking and building now once I start
[1:12:07] building I I've got a file and I I
[1:12:11] looked at that window well I've got I've
[1:12:12] got four Microsoft Word windows open at
[1:12:14] one time and I I looked at that one
[1:12:17] window that I studying from today and
[1:12:20] I'm on page
[1:12:21] 519 on the other window joining to it
[1:12:24] it's called 500 and something that's
[1:12:26] only part of it it's probably one that
[1:12:27] been about a th pages and that's of
[1:12:30] notes and things that I've made
[1:12:32] accumulation of years so whenever I'm
[1:12:35] there I look at it and then I see it
[1:12:37] building building then what I do is I
[1:12:40] look at it and I try to tear that
[1:12:43] thought
[1:12:46] apart you said why would you do that
[1:12:50] because if me a
[1:12:52] knucklehead can tear it apart
[1:12:56] the devil sure
[1:12:58] can if it's really God it'll stand the
[1:13:02] test and I've had things come to me that
[1:13:06] I thought were
[1:13:09] inspiration and I would think oh my
[1:13:12] goodness and it would so alarm me and
[1:13:15] excite me I said oh my
[1:13:18] goodness I can't believe I've never seen
[1:13:20] that before and I I'm sending myself
[1:13:24] emails all the time Time by by
[1:13:25] scriptures and quotes and things like
[1:13:27] that so I might send it to myself and
[1:13:29] then later when I got my laptop my lap
[1:13:31] said oh man I'm so excited and I go to
[1:13:34] pulling it up I thought wow and I said
[1:13:36] yeah I remember this and I remember that
[1:13:39] but all of a
[1:13:40] sudden I go to
[1:13:43] feeling so
[1:13:45] funny and I
[1:13:47] think
[1:13:49] Lord what's wrong something ain't right
[1:13:54] something ain't right
[1:13:56] and then this word will come to me and
[1:13:58] that word and that word and I go to
[1:14:00] pulling up this and
[1:14:02] that and I break out in a cold sweat
[1:14:05] brother
[1:14:06] Malachi I've sat in my chair and had to
[1:14:09] take my hand and rub my
[1:14:12] brow because I was fixing to build a
[1:14:17] subject on something that was only part
[1:14:23] truth and the more I studied it but the
[1:14:27] Jo I sat there and become a nervous
[1:14:31] wreck and I've actually set my laptop
[1:14:34] down before and just get up and walk
[1:14:36] around a little bit cuz I it just tore
[1:14:38] me all to
[1:14:40] pieces where did that come
[1:14:42] from let me tell you
[1:14:49] demons
[1:14:51] demons you see preachers are very
[1:14:53] vulnerable
[1:14:57] man he can get
[1:14:59] things that'll seem so
[1:15:02] real and it'll be so close to the
[1:15:06] truth but remember if it is the spirit
[1:15:09] of God it won't just take this quote and
[1:15:12] that one and that one it should be able
[1:15:14] to line up through the whole
[1:15:16] message before I ever saw the Oneness of
[1:15:19] the godhead Carol had an uncle and he
[1:15:20] was a great man really loved the Lord
[1:15:23] but he was Jesus only y'all know what
[1:15:25] Jesus only is most of you don't well
[1:15:28] Jesus only believes that Jesus was his
[1:15:31] own
[1:15:32] father and that many of them baptize
[1:15:34] single name you know what that is no
[1:15:37] okay they baptize in the name of Jesus
[1:15:42] only and Carol's Uncle every time I was
[1:15:44] still a trinitarian and every time he'd
[1:15:46] get around me boy he'd go to try to talk
[1:15:48] me to talk to me and convert to me and
[1:15:51] I'd always go back to where Matthew
[1:15:53] 28:19 and I said buddy no matter what
[1:15:57] what you say Jesus is the one that said
[1:16:00] that but her uncle bless his heart he
[1:16:04] would never be able to take Matthew
[1:16:08] 28:19 and tie it together with acts
[1:16:13] 238 and it's like it would stump him and
[1:16:18] he didn't have the
[1:16:20] answer but you know who God used to help
[1:16:22] me see it a man man who could take
[1:16:27] both Matthew 28:19 and acts 238 instead
[1:16:32] of setting them against one another made
[1:16:35] them blend
[1:16:37] together and when a man did that it open
[1:16:41] my eyes just like
[1:16:42] that I like hearing a man that can do
[1:16:46] that now these were the men of God and
[1:16:49] how they took the scriptures and they
[1:16:52] didn't have to just oh no no no no don't
[1:16:55] worry about the Old Testament no no
[1:16:56] don't don't don't worry about that we're
[1:16:58] we're in another day now we're in
[1:16:59] another day you don't need that that was
[1:17:01] not the way they were taught to preach
[1:17:03] the
[1:17:04] word so any idea I have or any other
[1:17:09] preacher that does not come back to the
[1:17:11] message of the hour you better run from
[1:17:14] it I don't care how good it feels I
[1:17:17] don't care how many people might say oh
[1:17:20] that's it that's it if it's the word of
[1:17:22] the Lord it'll come right back into the
[1:17:25] scripture and into the message of the
[1:17:30] hour let me close you momentarily
[1:17:33] Ephesians chapter 2: 19 now therefore
[1:17:35] you are no more strangers and foreigners
[1:17:38] but fellow citizens with the Saints and
[1:17:39] of the household of God and are
[1:17:42] built now this is the way the Apostolic
[1:17:45] Church
[1:17:47] taught their people you are built upon
[1:17:51] the
[1:17:53] foundation of the apost
[1:17:56] Apostles now wait a minute I thought
[1:17:58] Jesus was the
[1:18:01] foundation now remember what God is
[1:18:04] doing God is building a mystical
[1:18:08] spiritual body this is why we needed a
[1:18:12] prophit to take us back to our
[1:18:15] foundation which was the
[1:18:18] apostles now what is the foundations of
[1:18:21] the city in the Eighth Day what the
[1:18:25] names going to be on the foundations
[1:18:28] there those foundations building up of
[1:18:31] the city of the New Jerusalem what is it
[1:18:34] those foundations the apostolic
[1:18:37] foundations so the new testament's based
[1:18:39] upon it the city itself so the true
[1:18:43] bride are going to be Apostolic
[1:18:46] Believers not Apostolic organization but
[1:18:49] right here and are built upon the
[1:18:52] foundation of the Apostles
[1:18:57] and say it with me
[1:19:00] prophets Jesus Christ himself being the
[1:19:05] Chief
[1:19:06] Cornerstone so Paul
[1:19:10] takes that the foundation is the
[1:19:12] apostles and the prophets and the Chief
[1:19:16] Cornerstone anybody know what this is
[1:19:18] you know it's kind of different from our
[1:19:20] terminology of building but a lot of
[1:19:23] their buildings are made out of a stone
[1:19:26] so the Chief Cornerstone was a two-sided
[1:19:29] Stone like this so they would lay that
[1:19:32] first Cornerstone now watch Paul is
[1:19:35] doing a great mystery here in a symbol
[1:19:38] because he knows so you imagine how this
[1:19:42] must have seemed to the people of that
[1:19:44] day that Paul was actually saying Jesus
[1:19:47] laid him
[1:19:49] s on top of the
[1:19:53] Apostles and the prophet's
[1:19:56] teachings he's going to build his body
[1:20:00] so here is a two-sided Stone now watch
[1:20:03] Paul's mirror that he's looking at so
[1:20:07] one side will be
[1:20:09] Jews the other side will be
[1:20:12] Gentiles so here's the foundation of the
[1:20:16] Apostles and the prophets and Jesus said
[1:20:18] I'm laying
[1:20:20] myself right on top of that Foundation
[1:20:24] and I'll start it out with Jews and
[1:20:27] Gentiles and then there'll be more
[1:20:29] cornerstones more cornerstones build up
[1:20:32] build up build up praise God Ephesians
[1:20:37] 3:5 which in other Ages was not made
[1:20:39] known Unto the Sons of men as it is now
[1:20:43] revealed unto His Holy
[1:20:47] Apostles and Prophets look how these
[1:20:50] people in the New Testament preached
[1:20:54] about
[1:20:56] prophets can I have just a couple more
[1:20:58] minutes and we'll be able to finish this
[1:20:59] part tonight Ephesians chapter 4 verse
[1:21:03] 11 he gave some Apostles some prophets
[1:21:07] some evangelists some
[1:21:10] pastors and
[1:21:12] teachers fivefold Ministry now remember
[1:21:16] brother
[1:21:17] brandham brother brandham is not this
[1:21:21] class of prophet this is a prophet in
[1:21:24] the church
[1:21:25] he was a church AG messenger Silas that
[1:21:29] we read about in The Book of a acts
[1:21:32] agabus he was not a church age messenger
[1:21:35] Hebrews 1 1 God who innd our times and
[1:21:41] diverse
[1:21:42] manners spake in time passed unto the
[1:21:46] fathers by the
[1:21:48] prophets hath in these last days spoken
[1:21:51] unto us by his son
[1:21:57] wow so how did he speak to us by his
[1:22:01] son by Ephesians
[1:22:09] 4:11 his
[1:22:11] son well you say brother Donnie where's
[1:22:13] the Lord Jesus he's right here
[1:22:16] tonight he was here last night he was in
[1:22:19] Louisiana last night in Virginia all
[1:22:22] different parts of the world the Son of
[1:22:25] God still here anointing his ministry
[1:22:28] you see this ministry of Ephesians 4:11
[1:22:31] it's not really my Ministry it's not
[1:22:33] really about Joe's Ministry these
[1:22:35] brothers that we love and appreciate so
[1:22:37] much around the world it's actually
[1:22:40] Jesus ministry himself let's stand
[1:22:44] together we'll read our last scripture
[1:22:46] here Revelation 10
[1:22:49] 7 but in the days of the voice of the
[1:22:52] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:22:55] sound the
[1:22:57] mystery the mystery of God should be
[1:23:02] finished notice how John terms this that
[1:23:05] he doesn't say
[1:23:08] mysteries of God but it's the mystery of
[1:23:12] God should be finished as he hath
[1:23:16] declared to his servants the prophets so
[1:23:20] this is why we believe according to the
[1:23:23] New Testament prophecies as Jesus said
[1:23:26] in Matthew Elias truly shall first come
[1:23:31] and restore all things and we believe
[1:23:35] why do we believe this is brother
[1:23:37] Brandon you can do as I did if you so
[1:23:40] wish whenever someone started talking to
[1:23:42] me about Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation
[1:23:46] 10:7 Matthew 17 Matthew 11 and started
[1:23:50] telling me well that Prophet was brother
[1:23:52] randam I didn't just swallow it them he
[1:23:55] showed me the scriptures and I thought
[1:23:56] well you know what that's the Bible you
[1:23:59] know what I did I got dictionaries I got
[1:24:02] encyclopedias I went to a local library
[1:24:05] and I started ping up religious
[1:24:07] literature I thought well Jesus said
[1:24:09] there's going to be a prophet Malachi
[1:24:11] said this going to be so I started
[1:24:13] studying about the main leaders in that
[1:24:17] in this day which we lived to see who it
[1:24:20] was Oral Roberts John G Lake I went from
[1:24:24] one to the other to the other AA Allen
[1:24:28] this one that one the other
[1:24:30] one when I got done looking at all of
[1:24:33] that I
[1:24:35] thought the answer is
[1:24:38] simple the answer is simple there was
[1:24:41] only one
[1:24:43] man that could fit that
[1:24:46] pattern and really be a true prophet of
[1:24:49] God now I'm not belittling any of those
[1:24:52] men Whitmore some great men that did
[1:24:55] great things for God but that's not the
[1:24:57] same thing as being a church- aged
[1:24:59] messenger many of them were trinitarians
[1:25:02] AA Allen was a man of great Miracles
[1:25:05] Jack Co great Miracles great
[1:25:07] Supernatural trinitarians AA Allen
[1:25:11] Assembly of God many of those men of
[1:25:14] that day they didn't have the correct
[1:25:16] water baptism how could they restore us
[1:25:18] back to Apostolic fathers when Peter and
[1:25:22] them baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:25:23] Jesus
[1:25:25] so there had to be a man that would turn
[1:25:27] our hearts back or Roberts left the
[1:25:30] university a Allen went out to Arizona
[1:25:33] bought up Miracle Mile still named after
[1:25:35] him today after that Community there all
[1:25:38] of that that they did this man built
[1:25:40] this this man built that they've got
[1:25:43] roads named after him Billy Graham
[1:25:45] Highway Billy Graham bridge this that
[1:25:48] the other and what did Brother brandham
[1:25:52] leave any of our youth ever been to the
[1:25:55] brandham
[1:25:57] university you know why there isn't
[1:26:01] one so is there a four lane named after
[1:26:04] him maybe a
[1:26:07] bridge maybe a highway
[1:26:09] somewhere
[1:26:11] no as a matter of fact he went to Oral
[1:26:16] Roberts and he walked into his place and
[1:26:18] saw all the marble and saw all the
[1:26:21] letters being automated not even hand
[1:26:25] touched a human hand never even touched
[1:26:27] him opened up by automation receiving
[1:26:30] thousands of letters of
[1:26:33] wheat brother brandham walked out of
[1:26:35] there and felt kind of
[1:26:38] sad he said or's Ministry come off of
[1:26:40] mine TL
[1:26:43] osbor and he said Lord I I'd hate for
[1:26:46] them guys to see what I've got one
[1:26:49] typewriter sitting in the end of a
[1:26:51] little
[1:26:52] trailer and that was his office
[1:26:55] office he said Lord I guess you
[1:26:57] couldn't trust me with very
[1:27:00] much but a voice spoke to him and
[1:27:05] said
[1:27:09] Hallelujah but I am your
[1:27:12] portion give me
[1:27:14] that we've got a nice place the Lord's
[1:27:18] blessed us oh
[1:27:20] you but give me
[1:27:22] Jesus give me Jesus over a big
[1:27:25] name I've never had a big name don't
[1:27:28] want one never ask God for it my heart's
[1:27:31] desire is not that people will think I'm
[1:27:34] great in something you know that I my
[1:27:36] name would be a a common name among
[1:27:39] people but if I could be able to help
[1:27:42] people get
[1:27:43] saved if I could preach something that
[1:27:45] would set them
[1:27:46] free if I could talk a young person out
[1:27:50] of committing
[1:27:51] suicide if I could help a sister that
[1:27:54] struggling with makeup or something and
[1:27:56] and study and bring something that would
[1:27:58] help
[1:27:59] deliver that's my
[1:28:02] desire if I have to go by the way of the
[1:28:04] grave and my body is laid here in a
[1:28:06] casket and the brothers come and say
[1:28:09] whatever they can say about
[1:28:11] me let it not be said oh he was a great
[1:28:14] man he done this and that and the other
[1:28:17] no ain't what I
[1:28:18] want but let different people
[1:28:21] testify I was lost and God used him to
[1:28:25] lead me to Christ I was sick and God
[1:28:28] used him to bring
[1:28:30] healing but he didn't point us to
[1:28:32] himself he pointed us to the Lord Jesus
[1:28:36] no greater
[1:28:38] thing could be said about me than
[1:28:43] that what do you want people to say
[1:28:46] about
[1:28:49] you oh my don't you love him
[1:28:54] let's just bow our heads
[1:29:00] together Lord Jesus as we have our heads
[1:29:03] bowed
[1:29:05] together father we thank you for this
[1:29:07] little journey that we've taken tonight
[1:29:09] in the
[1:29:11] scriptures I Marvel Lord as I look at
[1:29:15] all of them and there's even more that I
[1:29:17] could have brought but I I think they
[1:29:20] got it Lord
[1:29:24] we're so grateful that you've opened our
[1:29:26] understanding and helped us to see in
[1:29:29] the scriptures why we believe you have
[1:29:33] sent a prophet in this
[1:29:35] day Lord God we are so
[1:29:38] grateful because we look around at the
[1:29:41] churches that are founded on this man
[1:29:45] and that man and this person and that
[1:29:48] person and I sat the other day talking
[1:29:51] to a man in a place of business
[1:29:56] he said what what what do you do I said
[1:29:59] I'm a I'm a pastor oh where at so we
[1:30:04] started talking a little
[1:30:05] bit and he said well I I used to go to
[1:30:08] church but over at this certain Church
[1:30:10] you heard of it I said no I don't think
[1:30:13] so he said well we went there but the
[1:30:16] pastor had one girlfriend in the church
[1:30:19] and another girlfriend and my wife
[1:30:23] committed adultery on me and he said you
[1:30:27] know now that I think about it it makes
[1:30:30] me wonder if she wasn't having an affair
[1:30:32] with
[1:30:33] him I said sir I am so
[1:30:36] sorry I'm so sorry I said I hope you
[1:30:39] know that every preacher don't do that
[1:30:42] he said oh I know they
[1:30:44] don't but I sat down and I heard the
[1:30:46] hurt in that man's voice the tears
[1:30:50] running out of his
[1:30:52] eyes I thought what is going to be for
[1:30:55] men who claim to be preachers that live
[1:30:58] a
[1:30:59] life of such God we thank you for the
[1:31:02] message of the
[1:31:04] hour keep me true Lord
[1:31:07] Jesus Keep Me
[1:31:09] true keep me faithful Lord help me that
[1:31:13] my life will always be worthy of the
[1:31:17] Gospel help these young people father
[1:31:21] that we won't just talk about a prophet
[1:31:23] but we'll be able to live this message
[1:31:26] that the prophet brought I don't think
[1:31:28] it was just mere
[1:31:30] chance that just a few months after he
[1:31:33] preaches the seals and the breach and
[1:31:35] God in
[1:31:37] Simplicity that he preaches a sermon
[1:31:39] called is your life worthy of the
[1:31:44] Gospel May Our Lives be worthy of this
[1:31:48] message
[1:31:50] Lord may we never get our eyes on this
[1:31:54] great
[1:31:54] preacher that great
[1:31:57] church this great
[1:31:59] work but may we always keep the same
[1:32:03] terminology that your Prophet
[1:32:05] had there's only one great one among us
[1:32:09] and that's
[1:32:11] Jesus all of us whenever we stand before
[1:32:14] you that day we'll bow our heads
[1:32:17] and we'll say that we don't even deserve
[1:32:21] a
[1:32:22] reward I don't think about a
[1:32:26] reward what little bit I've been able to
[1:32:29] do for you and your
[1:32:31] people I don't do it with a reward in
[1:32:34] mind when I get there that
[1:32:38] day if you say to all my brothers you
[1:32:41] all done this and that and the other and
[1:32:44] I woke up before you and I done my best
[1:32:46] but it'll be nothing compared to the
[1:32:49] Great
[1:32:50] Men but Lord Jesus there's some words I
[1:32:55] want to
[1:32:58] hear well
[1:33:00] done my good and faithful
[1:33:03] servant I'll be standing there and watch
[1:33:06] the Great Men of this
[1:33:08] day you'll reward them for their great
[1:33:12] sermons The Great prayer lines they had
[1:33:15] and all the things they done or it might
[1:33:18] take quite some time for each one of
[1:33:21] them as they get the reward and I want
[1:33:23] to be standing there I I tell my
[1:33:26] brothers
[1:33:27] that different ones of them I want to be
[1:33:29] standing near when you stand before
[1:33:33] [Music]
[1:33:34] him it may not take but just a few
[1:33:37] minutes for mine to be
[1:33:40] said but Lord if I can hear those
[1:33:44] words well done my good and faithful
[1:33:49] servant that will mean everything to me
[1:33:53] I'll be able to take my wife by her
[1:33:56] hand both of us knew in a glorified
[1:34:02] body and walk into the paradise of God
[1:34:06] it'll be worth all the hours that I've
[1:34:10] spent all the death threats that I've
[1:34:12] got all the ridicule that I've got even
[1:34:16] sometime from my
[1:34:18] brothers when even some of my own
[1:34:21] Brothers will call my name from their
[1:34:23] pulpits and blasphemy and whatever it'll
[1:34:28] be worth it
[1:34:29] Lord Lord Jesus maybe some of these
[1:34:32] young people have been misunderstood and
[1:34:34] they've been ridiculed and laughed at by
[1:34:37] friends family members maybe even people
[1:34:39] that go to church with but help them to
[1:34:42] realize we're not striving to please
[1:34:44] each other but
[1:34:46] you Lord I'm not looking to please the
[1:34:50] world if I please the world it's evident
[1:34:53] I'm I cannot please the world and please

[1:35:06] you with all my heart brother
[1:35:10] Michael certainly enjoyed that tonight
[1:35:14] really the thing that I love the most
[1:35:16] about it is he didn't use a single quote
[1:35:18] from brother Brandon to prove that he
[1:35:19] was a prophet and to prove why we
[1:35:21] believe what we beli he just used
[1:35:23] scripture the whole time we can identify
[1:35:25] everything that we've heard and we've
[1:35:26] learned in the Bible it's not some man's
[1:35:30] opinion it's the voice behind the voice
[1:35:32] that is teaching us and guiding Us in
[1:35:34] these things and I'd like to ask brother
[1:35:37] Donnie to help sing with this one ever
