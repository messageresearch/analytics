[29:58] anything more
[30:00] important than

[30:05] vacation you try to pack your suitcase
[30:08] and think of everything you'll need and
[30:11] what you can take on the flight and
[30:13] what's restricted and all that sort of
[30:16] thing you're foolish not to what about
[30:19] this
[30:20] journey when only those who have God's
[30:24] life the token will be allowed in this
[30:28] first
[30:29] resurrection so your skin color your
[30:33] wealth how nice your clothes are whether
[30:36] they come from the mall or from Goodwill
[30:39] it won't make a bit of difference what's
[30:42] going to matter is your heart is right
[30:45] before God
[30:46] Amen oh my I want to be ready don't you
[30:51] I want to be ready 1 Thessalonians
[30:54] chapter 4 verse 13
[30:59] we believe that we've got a message that
[31:01] is a getting ready message for
[31:04] sure one that's not rocking us to sleep
[31:07] and Leo deia and telling us everything's
[31:11] going to be good if we can just make it
[31:13] through the election year well I read
[31:16] the other day where it's always normal
[31:19] for heart attack rates to
[31:22] increase in presidential election
[31:26] year I thought thought wow ain't that
[31:29] something so you get all tore up have a
[31:31] heart attack and die and didn't do you a
[31:33] bit of good I mean you worry you fret
[31:36] you fear over the whole thing and
[31:37] whatever whoever is supposed to be in
[31:39] there is going to be in there anyway so
[31:41] look children they ain't no needing
[31:43] worrying and fretting over where the
[31:45] Trump's going to be there Camala I'll
[31:47] tell you who's going to be there the
[31:49] powers that be are
[31:52] ordained of God yes but brother Donnie I
[31:56] don't want so and so well may not want
[31:58] so and so either but if God wants
[32:00] somebody in there I don't care what we
[32:02] do we are not going to stop it that's
[32:05] right so I'd say we enjoy life we serve
[32:09] the Lord with all of our heart and then
[32:11] the morning after the election I guess
[32:13] we'll all know won't
[32:15] we and who knows we may not live to C
[32:19] anyway the Rapture may come first so why
[32:21] should I focus on that I want to focus
[32:24] on me being ready for the resurrection
[32:29] 1 Thessalonians
[32:32] 4:13 but I would not have you to be
[32:36] ignorant
[32:37] Brethren concerning them which are
[32:41] asleep that you sorrow not even as
[32:44] others which have no hope now that's the
[32:48] sad
[32:49] part for we believe that Jesus died and
[32:53] rose again even so them I love the way
[32:57] he says this
[32:58] also which sleep in Jesus will God bring
[33:04] with him amen will God bring with him
[33:10] for this we say unto you by the word of
[33:15] the Lord how many believes Paul had the
[33:17] word of the Lord concerning
[33:19] this okay now according to the Bible
[33:22] we're supposed to have at least two or
[33:23] three
[33:26] witnesses can anybody give me another
[33:31] witness testing one two one one two
[33:36] one according to the Bible two three
[33:39] Witnesses right you mean a
[33:42] prophet could get something from the
[33:45] Lord and it not even be written in the
[33:48] Bible Paul
[33:51] did and that's part of the problem I
[33:53] found with a lot of the message people
[33:55] they don't believe that about our
[33:56] Prophet amen they absolutely do not they
[34:00] do not believe that he could receive the
[34:02] word of the Lord that's why that they
[34:04] want to take their Bible
[34:07] knowledge and try to judge a Vindicated
[34:10] Prophet
[34:11] H need to go back to primmer don't they
[34:15] yeah this we say unto you by the word of
[34:19] the Lord Peter never said it Matthew
[34:22] Mark Luke John James now the rest of
[34:25] them that we which are alive and
[34:28] remain unto the coming of the Lord the
[34:31] Lord Jesus never even said this when he
[34:33] was here why he wanted his son to say
[34:38] this shall not prevent them which are
[34:44] asleep for the Lord himself shall
[34:47] descend from heaven with a shout an
[34:52] order
[34:54] command specifically a stimulating
[34:58] cry a signal is given to men a commander
[35:04] with a loud summons a trumpet call for
[35:09] the Lord himself shall descend from
[35:11] heaven with a
[35:13] shout with the voice of the
[35:17] Archangel and with the Trump of God and
[35:20] the dead in Christ shall rise first then
[35:23] we which are alive and remain shall
[35:27] shall be caught
[35:31] harpazo catch up take my Force catch
[35:35] away to
[35:37] seize carry off by force claim for
[35:42] oneself
[35:44] eagerly to snatch out our way it sounds
[35:49] like to me whoever's in charge of this
[35:52] Rapture is coming with great haste and
[35:55] he is going to snatch us us out of here
[35:59] with Force then we which are alive and
[36:02] remain shall be caught up together with
[36:06] them in the clouds to meet the Lord in
[36:10] the
[36:11] air and so shall we ever be with the
[36:15] Lord now wait a minute whoa whoa whoa
[36:17] whoa whoa whoa
[36:19] whoa now how can that
[36:23] be when John saw the new city descending
[36:27] from God out of Heaven coming down on
[36:30] the
[36:31] Earth but Paul says when we go
[36:35] up so shall we ever be with the
[36:38] Lord now wait a minute wait a minute
[36:40] what well you mean Paul said something
[36:43] that we can't understand most prophets
[36:47] do say all kinds of things that we don't
[36:52] understand the quicker we can get to
[36:54] that spot the closer we'll be to God
[36:56] actually
[36:58] so shall we ever be with the Lord up
[37:00] there how it going to be up there and be
[37:02] down
[37:03] here don't worry about it God will fix
[37:08] it
[37:09] wherefore this is something we can all
[37:12] understand Comfort one
[37:15] another with these
[37:17] words how many loves him tonight with
[37:20] all your heart God a prayer request
[37:23] something you need prayer for desire in
[37:25] your heart brother Pete Lawson had text
[37:28] me this evening before church and he
[37:30] hurt his back and he wanted us to be
[37:33] remembering remembering him tonight so
[37:36] let's let's go before the Lord
[37:39] now Lord Jesus we're so thankful father
[37:42] that you have given us your word by
[37:46] which we can live our everyday
[37:50] lives in your word it consists of
[37:55] songs Psalms
[37:59] oracles
[38:01] Mysteries easy to understand principles
[38:05] hard to comprehend
[38:07] things the will of God revealed the will
[38:11] of God hidden the will of God in the
[38:15] future the will of God in the present
[38:18] the will of God in the
[38:21] past so truly we need you the author of
[38:25] the book to help help us to understand
[38:29] the time the season where we are for we
[38:34] could read our Bible every day and if we
[38:37] would be possible for us to memorize
[38:40] every verse and we could quote it from
[38:43] the beginning to the end and still not
[38:47] really understand much about
[38:49] it because we must know the author to
[38:53] catch spiritual penmanship on our heart
[38:57] hearts and our souls so we ask you
[39:00] tonight that you would speak to us Lord
[39:03] we pray that you be mindful of the sick
[39:05] and the needy Lord Brother Pete Lawson
[39:08] we pray for our brother tonight all the
[39:11] requests Lord that were signified by the
[39:13] uplifting of hands would you meet every
[39:16] need according to your great riches
[39:18] father we pray in Jesus name and the
[39:22] Saints said amen amen God bless you
[39:25] friends you may be seated
[39:30] it's not really hard to understand
[39:33] why that the coming of the Lord and the
[39:39] Rapture has been something that has been
[39:42] so
[39:44] misunderstood down through time of
[39:46] course we know the Bible doesn't even
[39:49] use the word rapture but it comes from a
[39:53] root word which is similar to the one we
[39:55] read there called up or
[39:58] catchup and then because the Lord Jesus
[40:02] when he was here spoke of several
[40:06] advents that he would
[40:09] come he spoke about it in Matthew
[40:13] 24 he spoke about it in Luke
[40:16] 17 he spoke about it in Luke
[40:19] 21 and he identified as the coming of
[40:23] the Son of God then he called it the
[40:26] coming of the the son of man and he
[40:29] called it a coming in the
[40:32] clouds and then he called it a coming
[40:36] which would be a visible coming then
[40:39] John catches it and sees him coming out
[40:42] of Heaven on a white horse which Jesus
[40:45] never even mentioned either nor did
[40:48] Paul then Paul writes about this
[40:53] coming and then we have a prophet in
[40:56] this day which
[40:58] inserts another coming which seems even
[41:02] more
[41:04] mysterious called The Bride
[41:08] coming of
[41:11] Christ the bride
[41:14] coming of Christ so then people look at
[41:17] it and they try to think okay so Jesus
[41:21] is going to come and the trumpet is
[41:24] going to sound and everybody's going to
[41:25] hear it and the graves are going to
[41:28] burst open and we'll see the Dead come
[41:32] out and airplanes will crash and buses
[41:35] will crash and cars will crash
[41:40] everywhere and then others say no no no
[41:45] no no that's not the way the com of the
[41:47] Lord's going to be there ain't no
[41:50] Rapture cuz the Bible don't say nothing
[41:53] about no
[41:54] Rapture the church goes through the
[41:56] tribul ation
[41:58] period And I can say Amen to
[42:01] that the church does now that's what I
[42:05] used to believe and preach I never
[42:09] believed in a Rapture until I come to
[42:12] this
[42:13] truth so what I saw was that the church
[42:18] would go through the tribulation period
[42:22] for
[42:23] purification I was right as far as I
[42:27] could
[42:28] see but I needed an understanding of the
[42:32] difference between the bride and the
[42:36] church now a lot of people still believe
[42:40] that same thing that there is no Rapture
[42:42] there is no catching away so then they
[42:46] put that coming when every eye will
[42:50] Behold Him that is scripture but that's
[42:54] not the
[42:55] Rapture so what coming is that what is
[42:59] the coming of Revelation 19 when John
[43:04] sees him coming out of Heaven on a white
[43:07] horse and the faithful The Chosen the
[43:10] called they come out of heaven with him
[43:14] on white
[43:15] horses and then how is it that Paul
[43:19] could insert this and no one else even
[43:23] Bears witness in the same way that Paul
[43:28] identified this
[43:30] coming wonder why Peter didn't say
[43:32] something about it wonder why Jesus
[43:36] didn't say something in the same way so
[43:40] it almost seems that Jesus said his
[43:43] coming in one way or one form or
[43:47] fashion John said it in
[43:50] another and Paul said it in
[43:55] another and you look at it and you try
[43:58] to think well how does it all fit
[44:01] together but now
[44:03] remember he can come as many times as he
[44:08] wants
[44:10] to and in this day what's astounding is
[44:14] that there is a
[44:16] coming of the Lord Jesus which is even
[44:20] more mysterious than first Thessalonians
[44:24] 4 and that is the revealing
[44:27] of the son of
[44:29] man which of course is a
[44:33] Prelude and ties into the bride coming
[44:38] of
[44:39] Christ so what A peculiar
[44:43] term bride coming of Christ now why
[44:48] didn't Paul say it that way oh why
[44:51] didn't Matthew write it that way why
[44:54] didn't John you know because God gives
[44:57] to each one I'm talking about prophets
[45:00] now their portion of the word so Paul
[45:06] could not say exactly John's portion
[45:10] John had a great insight about the
[45:12] coming of the Lord but John never wrote
[45:16] about the Rapture per se so John doesn't
[45:21] identify the Rapture going away he says
[45:24] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[45:27] but we know that when he shall appear
[45:30] we'll be like him but John gave no
[45:32] divine order John didn't say the dead
[45:35] would rise first or the living would be
[45:38] changed first John didn't say Jesus
[45:42] didn't exactly give the divine order he
[45:46] left that to Paul y'all believe this
[45:49] right so the Lord Jesus could allow Paul
[45:53] to write part John to write part Matthew
[45:58] to WR
[46:00] part well if he had another prophet in
[46:04] the last
[46:06] day could not he allow him also to say
[46:12] another part of the
[46:15] mystery now if the
[46:18] anointing of
[46:21] Elijah and Malachi
[46:24] 45 is actually split in
[46:29] half and God would take the first part
[46:33] of that and Jesus clearly identified
[46:37] that John the Baptist fulfilled that
[46:40] first part of that scripture is that
[46:43] right so whenever his disciples ask him
[46:46] how come the scribes say that Elias's
[46:49] come I want you to notice the scribes
[46:52] they knew this but the disciples never
[46:55] said they they knew
[46:57] so it kind of perplexed them cuz most of
[47:01] the disciples were the
[47:03] Pharisee aspect so they looked at things
[47:07] a little bit different but it was the
[47:11] scribes or the doctors of the law so
[47:15] they'd come to the disciples and say hey
[47:18] what what about this thing about Elijah
[47:20] wh what's your master teach about that
[47:23] and I said we don't we don't really even
[47:25] know we we not already heard him say
[47:27] anything about
[47:29] Elijah so they asked the Lord Jesus uh
[47:32] you you're talking about going to
[47:34] Jerusalem and you're talking about the
[47:36] son of man's going to go up and this is
[47:38] going to happen how come the the scribes
[47:41] say elij has got to come first and Jesus
[47:45] said he's already come and you didn't
[47:48] know it but I say unto you Elias truly
[47:55] shall first
[47:57] come now watch how Jesus Takes Malachi 4
[48:02] and divides that verse and shows that
[48:05] part of it actually happened in his day
[48:10] but prophesying the rest of it would
[48:13] happen in our day now he says Elias has
[48:17] already come and when everyone began to
[48:20] explain it then the disciples knew that
[48:23] he spake of John the Baptist but nowes
[48:26] Jesus divided it and said truly Elias
[48:30] shall which we all know means future
[48:33] tense shall come and restore all things
[48:39] now somebody that knows your Bible I'll
[48:41] give you the opportunity to stand to
[48:43] your feet right
[48:45] now and tell me what did John the
[48:50] Baptist
[48:53] restore if he fulfilled first and second
[48:58] half of Malachi
[49:00] 4:5 what did he
[49:04] restore yeah was it the law the mishna
[49:08] the Torah written and Unwritten did he
[49:12] point them back to the Ten Commandments
[49:15] did he point them back to a levitical
[49:19] priesthood did he point them back to the
[49:22] law what did John restore them to John
[49:27] identifies himself in Isaiah 40
[49:33] verse3 whenever the head men sent out
[49:37] their disciples and they said uh those
[49:41] that are above us are you know our our
[49:43] chief uh organizational guys they sent
[49:47] us out to ask you who are you are you
[49:53] Elijah and he said no
[49:59] oh say okay go so so somebody help me
[50:01] here so did Jesus
[50:04] lie or did John
[50:11] lie boy seems like it's getting awful
[50:13] warm in here to
[50:15] me now Jesus said that John Was
[50:20] Elijah but when they asked John was he
[50:24] Elijah he said no I'm
[50:30] not but you see John was answering I'm
[50:34] not that Elijah of the last
[50:38] day
[50:40] amen John was not saying he did not have
[50:44] the spirit of Elijah the angel of the
[50:46] Lord identified who he was and Luke one
[50:51] whenever he tells the identification of
[50:54] John's Ministry and then when when they
[50:56] ask him who are you that we may give an
[50:59] answer to those who sin us he said I am
[51:03] the voice of one crying in the
[51:07] wilderness prepare ye the way for the
[51:12] Lord not a restoration Prophet at all
[51:17] now what John was doing he was taking up
[51:21] the identification of a servant which
[51:24] would go before a no man or a king or a
[51:29] general now they did not have Interstate
[51:33] 26 they didn't even have okalona Road
[51:37] they did not have roads the way we do
[51:40] today so they would send out men in
[51:44] front of them if they were coming on a
[51:46] chariot and they might send them out
[51:49] several days or several weeks in advance
[51:52] depending on how long their Journey was
[51:55] and they would dig up the Rocks they
[51:57] would move the trees and they was making
[52:01] a road for this great man to come not
[52:06] restoring not
[52:09] rebuilding making a road so John said
[52:13] this is my mission I'm throwing rocks
[52:17] out of the way I'm throwing these things
[52:20] that are in the past of the oncoming one
[52:24] now who was it that was able to receive
[52:28] the coming or the Advent of the Lord
[52:32] Jesus those who heard the preparation
[52:37] message now I know there are those even
[52:40] who say they believe the message of the
[52:42] hour that do not really preach the
[52:46] message of the hour they think it's
[52:47] enough to Simply believe God sent a
[52:51] prophet but they really don't preach the
[52:54] message they just go through the Bible
[52:57] stories that's been preached for
[52:59] hundreds and hundreds of years and they
[53:02] keep the preaching of the message to
[53:06] themselves but what if we would have
[53:09] done that in the days of John the
[53:11] Baptist come on and John the Baptist
[53:15] would have just stood up and knew who he
[53:18] was but he never really threw any rocks
[53:22] out of the way or he never really you
[53:25] know crossed a branch and and made a
[53:28] path across he never done any of that he
[53:31] said you know what it it'll cause too
[53:33] much trouble so I I'm just going to go
[53:36] down through here and I I'll shovel out
[53:38] a little bit of sand and I I I just
[53:40] ain't going to cause much of a Ruckus
[53:42] and I I'll be loved and I'll be accepted
[53:45] by everybody but John caused a lot of
[53:49] trouble now you realize why because he
[53:53] had to throw a Pharisee over here and a
[53:55] sadducee over there and a scribe cuz
[53:58] they was right in the middle of the way
[54:01] and John had to absolutely get their
[54:04] hide out from under the chariot wheels
[54:07] of the oncoming King so sometimes it
[54:10] might have been Theory it might have
[54:12] been ideology it might have been a
[54:15] priest it might have been a you know
[54:17] some King whoever it was but John said
[54:20] I'm here to prepare the way of the Lord
[54:24] the way had not been prepared by anyone
[54:27] else so who was it then when the Lord
[54:30] Jesus come on the scene that were the
[54:32] initial followers of the Lord Jesus
[54:36] those who heard the message of the first
[54:40] part of Malachi
[54:44] 45 who was it that killed the Lord Jesus
[54:49] those who
[54:51] refused the first part of the message of
[54:55] Malachi 45 who's going to go in the
[54:59] Rapture in the last days those who hear
[55:05] the last part of Malachi
[55:08] 45 now it's not enough to say well I I
[55:12] believe it God sent a prophet every
[55:13] devil in hell believes that they got way
[55:16] more sense than a lot of these folks
[55:17] that have left the message them devils
[55:19] are trying to talk them people out of
[55:21] the message and then they'll stand
[55:23] before them that day and going to be
[55:25] condemned whenever ever they do but only
[55:28] those who receive the Preparatory
[55:31] message by this messenger and he was
[55:34] identified by the scripture then when
[55:36] the Lord Jesus come what did John do he
[55:40] turned that day and he said Behold the
[55:42] Lamb of God their hearts had been turned
[55:47] toward him so John had made a way he had
[55:50] straightened out all the path boy he had
[55:53] tore high he was rough as he could be
[55:56] and then he pointed the followers of
[55:59] himself toward the lord Jesus and that's
[56:02] exactly what the Lotter part of Malachi
[56:06] 45 is going to do as well so for those
[56:09] who believe that in the last day that
[56:13] the bride whoever goes in the Rapture
[56:16] will be a confederation or a blending
[56:19] together of genuine message people there
[56:23] will also be Catholics Baptists
[56:26] Methodist Church of God W this
[56:28] trinitarian Mormons all this and that
[56:31] and the other now how does that answer
[56:34] to the scripture the way that it did to
[56:37] the first fulfilling of the first half
[56:40] of Malachi 4 so there was no need in
[56:44] reality for God to send Malachi for the
[56:48] first time if you didn't really need to
[56:51] hear what he had to say to meet Jesus
[56:55] it's the same in the last sending of
[56:58] that same anointing that if you do not
[57:01] need to hear what that messenger said
[57:05] there was no need for God to even send
[57:07] him in the first place because you can
[57:10] belong to a denomination you can pray to
[57:13] Mary you can have your rosary on your
[57:15] neck and the last prayer you pray is to
[57:18] Mary and to Joseph and St Andrew and St
[57:22] bonfice and then in a moment and a
[57:24] twinkling of an eye you're changed so
[57:26] you're sitting there with mascara on
[57:28] you're a woman you got on pants you got
[57:30] on earrings you got you know all that
[57:32] sort of thing of the world you're a man
[57:34] and you're sitting there transgender
[57:36] male and you just did a drag show night
[57:39] before last but yet you are a Believer
[57:42] and you're going in the Rapture trash
[57:48] nonsense praise the Lord I don't know
[57:51] the names and I don't know how many but
[57:55] I do have a general idea of who's going
[57:58] to go in this Rapture in the last days
[58:02] it will be those who are following the
[58:05] LGH part of the message of Malachi
[58:09] 45 I ain't talking about those that are
[58:12] just sitting around it and they don't
[58:14] live it they don't really believe it
[58:17] they might be able to talk it I ain't
[58:18] talking about that I'm talking about
[58:21] those that believe it so much they are
[58:24] living every day for the coming of the
[58:28] Lord Jesus they are watching they are
[58:31] waiting they are praying they're doing
[58:34] everything they know to do they are
[58:37] concerned about their children they're
[58:39] concerned about the loss come on
[58:41] somebody preach with me tonight why
[58:44] because they know that coming of the
[58:46] Lord could be before 6:00 in the morning
[58:50] they know that what lacks being
[58:53] fulfilled as far as the bride of Christ
[58:56] is concerned can you imagine the prophet
[58:58] in the late 60s saying that he did not
[59:01] know of one more scripture that needed
[59:04] to be fulfilled before the bride went
[59:07] away well if he would say that then what
[59:10] about now
[59:12] friends but keep in mind now that it
[59:15] will be the concept of teachers and
[59:19] theologians that will bring this false
[59:22] Doctrine to people and rock them to
[59:25] sleep when with the leot to see and LBI
[59:28] that everybody's going to go in the
[59:30] Rapture and all you have to do is
[59:33] believe in the cross that's all you need
[59:36] to do so you don't need the Holy Ghost
[59:38] it don't matter how you dress it don't
[59:41] matter how you live because you believe
[59:43] in the cross of course the Lord Jesus
[59:46] himself never taught that nor did the
[59:49] apostles because Jesus told his Apostles
[59:52] it was they must go get the Holy Ghost
[59:56] by the time Jesus told them and of
[59:57] course acts 1 and8 they already believed
[1:00:01] in the cross but believing in the cross
[1:00:04] was not enough to keep them from denying
[1:00:07] the Lord Jesus they seen him die on the
[1:00:10] cross and yet every one of them fled is
[1:00:14] that true so there had to come something
[1:00:17] else than Believing on the cross there
[1:00:20] had to come the life of the Lamb of God
[1:00:23] which died on the cross had to come back
[1:00:25] and beside the worshiper and Purge their
[1:00:28] conscience and fill them with the same
[1:00:31] life that the Lamb of God had
[1:00:34] himself and that's why when they begin
[1:00:36] to preach now Paul when he comes and he
[1:00:38] went to the upper coast of Ephesus and
[1:00:40] he finds certain disciples there and he
[1:00:42] said unto them how have you received the
[1:00:45] Holy Ghost since you believe they said
[1:00:47] unto him we have not so much heard if
[1:00:50] there be any Holy Ghost now they he said
[1:00:53] well how was you baptized well we were B
[1:00:56] baptized under John there were two
[1:00:57] dispensations behind they were still
[1:01:00] baptizing the way that John baptized
[1:01:03] John never said a name John simply
[1:01:06] baptized unto him that was to come and
[1:01:09] Paul told him you got to be baptized
[1:01:12] over again and of course they was
[1:01:14] baptized and the Holy Ghost fell on them
[1:01:17] well they were good Baptist Believers
[1:01:19] but it was not enough they had to have
[1:01:22] the Holy Ghost may I say to every member
[1:01:25] of word of of Life church it's not
[1:01:27] enough to come here it's not enough to
[1:01:30] come two times a week three times a week
[1:01:33] five times a week it's not enough to
[1:01:35] have long hair sisters it's not enough
[1:01:38] Brothers to look like a man and not look
[1:01:40] like a woman but we must have the Holy
[1:01:43] Ghost in our souls we must be born again
[1:01:47] we must have the exact same light that
[1:01:50] was in Jesus Christ it will be those and
[1:01:54] those alone that will go in the
[1:01:58] Rapture now if we look at that and then
[1:02:01] we come back and say so what will make
[1:02:04] us different than the prior ages that
[1:02:07] looked for the coming of the Lord will
[1:02:10] there be an abundance of more knowledge
[1:02:14] will there be a greater understanding of
[1:02:17] of Truth what will it that will bring us
[1:02:21] to the place that we will need to be so
[1:02:24] for 2,000 years 7 Church age
[1:02:27] dispensations people had believed in the
[1:02:29] power of the blood the power of the
[1:02:30] cross the power of forgiveness the power
[1:02:32] of mercy and the power of the attributes
[1:02:34] of God they believed in many of these
[1:02:37] great principles for thousands of years
[1:02:40] and yet believing in that never produced
[1:02:43] a Rapture in the first age and it hasn't
[1:02:46] produced one yet then when we come to
[1:02:48] the restoration of gifts on ausa Street
[1:02:51] then people begin to believe in the
[1:02:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost and they begin
[1:02:55] to believe in speaking in tongues
[1:02:57] prophecy interpretation and so on and
[1:02:59] yet that swept the world tens of
[1:03:02] millions of people
[1:03:10] started and yet believing in that alone
[1:03:14] never brought a Rapture so here was the
[1:03:17] people on isusa street when it started
[1:03:20] from there and it swept the world the
[1:03:22] dead were being raised cancers was being
[1:03:25] heal
[1:03:26] blinded eyes were coming open all kinds
[1:03:29] of great phenomenal things that was
[1:03:31] happening in the 40s and the 50s and the
[1:03:34] 60s which to this day has not been
[1:03:37] surpassed and my view never will be
[1:03:39] because it'll never be a global thing as
[1:03:42] it was then and all those Miracles alone
[1:03:47] never produced a Rapture so then we come
[1:03:51] to where that we have a man who says an
[1:03:54] angel of God
[1:03:56] and told him that he was sent with a
[1:03:59] message from the presence of God and
[1:04:02] that his message would for around the
[1:04:04] coming of the Lord Jesus people began to
[1:04:07] flock to his ministry by the tens of
[1:04:10] thousands the dead were raised again the
[1:04:14] lame made to walk the blind received
[1:04:17] their sight people who were born without
[1:04:22] eyeballs would receive eyeballs created
[1:04:26] before thousands of people sitting there
[1:04:29] in those
[1:04:30] Services you've heard the story probably
[1:04:33] of brother Billy Paul telling about it
[1:04:35] he told me about it as well one time
[1:04:38] whenever brother random was going to
[1:04:39] pray for a little child little girl best
[1:04:41] I remember and the little girl had no
[1:04:43] eyeballs and the brother Bram was going
[1:04:45] to pray for her and he started to pray
[1:04:48] and then he stopped and said I'm sorry
[1:04:51] honey I forgot to ask you what color
[1:04:53] eyes did you want
[1:04:56] well that's pretty specific is it not
[1:04:59] what color eyes do you want and the
[1:05:01] little girl tells him what color eyes
[1:05:04] that she wanted and guess what she got
[1:05:07] what she wanted now that's pretty
[1:05:09] phenomenal is it not that that's pretty
[1:05:12] awesome but at the same time or Roberts
[1:05:15] was praying for all kinds of people now
[1:05:18] for those of you that have not done your
[1:05:20] homework I would advise you to do so
[1:05:23] just so you understand that brother
[1:05:25] Brandon was not the only one that had
[1:05:28] phenomenal Miracles as a matter of fact
[1:05:30] when I started looking at this message
[1:05:33] it was not the Miracles that led me to
[1:05:35] believe that brother Brandon was a
[1:05:37] prophet cuz I'd seen miracles in my own
[1:05:40] Ministry I'd seen miracles in the
[1:05:42] ministry of other men that I preached
[1:05:44] with and preach for so it was not the
[1:05:48] Miracles alone that got my attention
[1:05:51] Jack Cole was one of the greatest
[1:05:53] phenomenal men whenever people would
[1:05:55] would come up Jack Coast Tent he'd have
[1:05:57] an anvil sitting right up close to his
[1:05:59] pull pit whenever people would come up
[1:06:01] with glasses he'd reach and grab a hold
[1:06:03] of your glasses and he had that Anvil
[1:06:05] and a hammer he'd stand there and bust
[1:06:07] your glasses right there if you had an
[1:06:09] heade he'd take that heade off and bust
[1:06:11] your heate you better have faith or H
[1:06:14] all the rest of your life one of the
[1:06:15] other so I mean there was phenomenal
[1:06:18] things that took place it covered the
[1:06:21] Earth till osbor now that man gives some
[1:06:25] of the the greatest testimonies about
[1:06:27] brother random that that you can ever
[1:06:29] hear in your life he said other men told
[1:06:32] us about Jesus Christ but William
[1:06:34] Brandon showed us Jesus Christ that's
[1:06:37] right and yet the phenomenal the
[1:06:40] Miracles the supernatural that Circle
[1:06:43] The Globe I'm not talking about a little
[1:06:45] bit in the church here and a little bit
[1:06:47] in the church there it was all over the
[1:06:50] world so when a brother come to my
[1:06:52] church and started preaching that
[1:06:54] brother brandham was Was Elijah and that
[1:06:56] he come to fulfill that scripture well I
[1:06:59] didn't like it and it upset me cuz I
[1:07:01] thought he ought to talk to me first
[1:07:03] about it before he done it I was the
[1:07:04] pastor so anyway I started looking and I
[1:07:08] thought you know what I I'm going to get
[1:07:10] my Bible I got in the scripture I
[1:07:11] started reading reading reading and I
[1:07:14] got in I said well even Jesus himself
[1:07:17] said that this was going to happen so I
[1:07:20] I come to that conclusion all right the
[1:07:22] Lord Jesus said this is going to happen
[1:07:24] then I thought okay if is going to
[1:07:26] happen has it happened before now has it
[1:07:30] circled the Earth has it come over the
[1:07:32] Earth and I come to the conclusion no it
[1:07:35] had not and then if it is yet to come or
[1:07:39] if it's happened in my day then who
[1:07:41] would that be so I started studying or
[1:07:44] Roberts I studied TL osbor I studied
[1:07:47] Jack Cole I studied valma Gardner I
[1:07:49] studied all these men in that era I read
[1:07:53] all things are possible David irvan I
[1:07:55] read so many books and did so many
[1:07:58] research looking why I didn't want to be
[1:08:00] deceived I didn't want to be lost and I
[1:08:03] certainly didn't want to deceive other
[1:08:05] people and whenever I got done with all
[1:08:08] of that research and looking I come to
[1:08:11] one conclusion and let me say this the
[1:08:15] conclusion that I reached all those
[1:08:18] years ago I still have the same
[1:08:20] conclusion tonight there was one man
[1:08:24] that would be able to fulfill that spot
[1:08:27] and I reckon you know what his name is
[1:08:29] don't you well you know it's really sad
[1:08:33] because a lot of those who said they
[1:08:35] believe this and supposedly came to the
[1:08:37] same conclusion they are no longer of
[1:08:40] the same conclusion which is really
[1:08:43] really sad cu the Bible says it would
[1:08:45] have better for them to have not known
[1:08:47] the way of life than after they have
[1:08:49] known it to turn and go back then they
[1:08:51] go back to like a s in her wallowing in
[1:08:55] a Tom or the dog returning to its vomit
[1:08:59] well that's exactly what they're eating
[1:09:01] on too vomit all you got to do is listen
[1:09:03] to a few of them and you can see but
[1:09:05] whenever I wanted to be sure brother
[1:09:08] Joel that I was going to present this in
[1:09:11] the right way and for everything that I
[1:09:14] approached every bit that I looked to me
[1:09:17] it was conclusive that was only one man
[1:09:20] that could match that identification or
[1:09:23] Roberts Le us un Unity there's Bridges
[1:09:27] there's roads this and that and the
[1:09:29] other that's named after Oral Roberts
[1:09:31] all you got to do is go to Asheville and
[1:09:33] you'll see Bridges and Roads and so on
[1:09:36] named after Billy Graham he left us a
[1:09:38] college well this man left this this man
[1:09:41] left that one left the university
[1:09:43] another left this you know out in
[1:09:45] Arizona Miracle Valley by a all so but
[1:09:49] what did Brother brandham leave us there
[1:09:51] is no University in Jeffersonville I've
[1:09:54] never across any bridges that are named
[1:09:58] in dedication to William Mar and
[1:10:00] brandham there are no public schools
[1:10:03] named after him but what did he leave he
[1:10:07] left us a desire that people would fall
[1:10:11] in love with Jesus
[1:10:13] Christ it it would absolutely break his
[1:10:17] heart to see what people have done with
[1:10:21] his message that people oh my that
[1:10:24] people want want to set down the
[1:10:26] ministry and shut them up you imagine if
[1:10:29] brother Brandon was sharing this day
[1:10:31] what he would do oh he'd probably take
[1:10:33] off his belt and wire some of these
[1:10:34] people out brother brandom ordained
[1:10:37] preachers to get in the pull pit and
[1:10:38] preach and others say they're doing what
[1:10:40] he said they're trying to discourage
[1:10:42] every preacher they can there's a
[1:10:44] problem somewhere
[1:10:46] friends come on don't get quiet on me
[1:10:48] now but you and I have to make up our
[1:10:52] minds do we believe this word that God
[1:10:56] has sent us in this last day and if we
[1:10:59] believe this message is the answer to
[1:11:01] Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10 not
[1:11:06] only Revelation 10:7 but remember in the
[1:11:09] early years the prophet whenever God
[1:11:12] opened up a portion of that to him he
[1:11:14] would quote it Revelation 10:7
[1:11:17] Revelation 10:7 but as the word become
[1:11:21] more in plain view and the bride coming
[1:11:25] of Christ was opened up to him he
[1:11:28] started including Revelation
[1:11:32] 101 to seven now you see Revelation 10:7
[1:11:37] was as far as he saw brother Daryl for
[1:11:40] many many years but what is revelation
[1:11:43] 101 and I saw another Mighty Angel come
[1:11:46] down from heaven with a little an open
[1:11:48] book of course and he said and then as
[1:11:51] God opened to the prophet those other
[1:11:54] six verses
[1:11:55] he be to quote that in with Luke 17:30
[1:12:00] and identified as the bride coming of
[1:12:03] Christ I hope you understand where I'm
[1:12:04] going tonight that the Lord Jesus is not
[1:12:08] just coming he's already
[1:12:11] here as a matter of fact he's been here
[1:12:15] for quite some
[1:12:17] time so it's not the coming of
[1:12:20] Revelation 19 it is not the coming of
[1:12:24] Matthew 24 when every eye will Behold
[1:12:28] Him but it is in contrast the coming of
[1:12:32] Romeo looking for his
[1:12:35] Juliet and he leans the seven steps
[1:12:39] lighter over against her house against
[1:12:43] the window and the shout the message
[1:12:46] goes out and wakes up Juliet out of her
[1:12:50] Le to see and Slumber and she goes to
[1:12:54] the window and she said it is the voice
[1:12:57] of my beloved so you see some people
[1:13:01] push play and all they hear is the voice
[1:13:04] of a man some people come to Word of
[1:13:07] Life all they hear is the voice of Daryl
[1:13:10] word or Donnie Reagan or some of these
[1:13:12] other preachers but other people have
[1:13:15] another way to hear and they're hearing
[1:13:18] the voice of their bridegroom and their
[1:13:21] bridegroom is telling them get ready
[1:13:24] make every saying right trim your lamps
[1:13:27] come on Saints oh Hallelujah so you see
[1:13:30] those who have the ability to hear Let
[1:13:34] Him
[1:13:36] hear now whenever we look at the coming
[1:13:39] of the Lord if it will be a continuing
[1:13:43] of the preaching of the Cross why was
[1:13:46] not in the first church age a Rapture
[1:13:50] which was preached since the impression
[1:13:52] of the Cross would have been so new
[1:13:55] and so fresh upon those people so the
[1:13:58] the men that would have been preaching
[1:14:00] it would have at least been in the
[1:14:02] distance where it happened John was the
[1:14:04] only one that we have record of that was
[1:14:06] actually there and yet John mentions the
[1:14:10] cross of the Lord Jesus less than
[1:14:14] Paul well I find that very
[1:14:17] odd John was actually there and he
[1:14:21] mentions the cross of Jesus less
[1:14:25] and fewer times than the four
[1:14:29] gospels well if just preaching the cross
[1:14:33] is what you need Paul must have missed
[1:14:35] it 2,000 years ago why would Paul preach
[1:14:38] on the Holy Ghost and gifts and hair and
[1:14:42] husbands loving your wives and wives
[1:14:44] obeying your husband why in the world
[1:14:46] would he not just preach the cross the
[1:14:48] cross the cross the cross the cross why
[1:14:50] would he preach that less why would John
[1:14:54] the very one who was there and John
[1:14:57] himself every sermon John preached was
[1:15:00] not on the cross as a matter of fact
[1:15:02] You' think the only man that was there
[1:15:04] brother the Rob that that man would
[1:15:06] preach it over and over again I'm not
[1:15:09] going to tell you how many times he said
[1:15:10] it CU I want you look it up yourself
[1:15:12] it's quite surprising how few a time you
[1:15:16] know how we are as we go through things
[1:15:18] that you we've we've heard brother Daryl
[1:15:20] talk about the experience with Jessica
[1:15:22] you've heard me talk about different
[1:15:23] experiences and you listen here brother
[1:15:25] Brandon talk about experiences he had
[1:15:28] and would say some of the same things
[1:15:30] over again well your John was the only
[1:15:31] disciple that saw the cross wonder why
[1:15:34] he didn't reiterate it over and over and
[1:15:36] over and over and if just believing the
[1:15:39] death of the Lord Jesus on the cross
[1:15:41] would endure people with on high with
[1:15:44] power from on high You' think he preach
[1:15:46] it every
[1:15:48] sermon but he yet he actually preached
[1:15:51] the Holy Ghost more than he preached the
[1:15:53] cross
[1:15:55] wow so there must be then a message that
[1:16:00] will
[1:16:01] forun the Rapture right amen now if the
[1:16:05] Lord Jesus had to be foran by a message
[1:16:09] of preparation by a messenger of
[1:16:13] preparation then those who heard the
[1:16:16] messenger in turn turn right around and
[1:16:19] heard the Lord Jesus those who crucified
[1:16:23] John eventually
[1:16:25] crucified the Lord Jesus those who
[1:16:29] crucify the message of the last days
[1:16:33] they don't realize it but they're
[1:16:34] crucifying Christ the second
[1:16:37] time you see the Lord Jesus had these
[1:16:41] seven Church angels in his right hand
[1:16:45] now most of these people who fight the
[1:16:47] message will not admit it but actually
[1:16:50] they have a problem with God their
[1:16:53] problem is not with brother bradam their
[1:16:56] problem is not actually with us their
[1:16:59] problem is with God because why did God
[1:17:04] vindicate this man and even his proteges
[1:17:07] of that time you listen to The Men Who
[1:17:10] were there with him and they were not
[1:17:13] the ones that sang all the lies that are
[1:17:15] being said now they were afraid to they
[1:17:19] were scared to death to say things
[1:17:22] against it because they saw what
[1:17:25] happened can you imagine sitting there
[1:17:27] and you walk up and the man says I see
[1:17:30] you live on
[1:17:31] 385 North Street you went to your doctor
[1:17:34] today I see there's three steps going up
[1:17:36] to your house your doctor had on glasses
[1:17:39] the doctor said this that and that and
[1:17:41] you're going to St there and say that
[1:17:43] man's a devil well there's enough dumb
[1:17:45] people left in the world some of them
[1:17:46] would but there's enough people that's
[1:17:48] got enough sense to say I don't
[1:17:50] understand it but I sure ain't going to
[1:17:51] say nothing about it but you realize
[1:17:54] that there must must then come a message
[1:17:57] now to me whenever we look at the hour
[1:18:00] and the time that we're in it makes me
[1:18:02] want to get into the message more and
[1:18:05] more than I've ever been before to make
[1:18:08] sure that I am not overlooking an
[1:18:11] essence of something that is going to be
[1:18:14] needful for us to be able to get out of
[1:18:17] here or are we somehow convinced well we
[1:18:20] can just kind of keep on going the same
[1:18:22] way we've gone for years because come to
[1:18:25] church we play church we come to church
[1:18:26] when we want to when we don't want to
[1:18:29] you know it's okay and we just have the
[1:18:31] same old desire you know and and we we
[1:18:34] love God but God ain't everything to us
[1:18:36] we get much more excited about a
[1:18:38] vacation than we do God or we get much
[1:18:40] more excited about making more money or
[1:18:42] something like that and God's good sure
[1:18:44] yeah God's a good God but the world says
[1:18:46] that but or is there something more by
[1:18:50] which it will require us to move into a
[1:18:54] higher place than what we've ever been
[1:18:57] before and if there is that where would
[1:19:01] we find the source of it would it be
[1:19:04] just going back through and preaching
[1:19:07] Daniel and the lionen again or would it
[1:19:10] be repr preaching Shadrach mesach and
[1:19:12] Abednego or repr preaching about David
[1:19:15] and gol I love all those stories don't
[1:19:18] you I believe them with all of my heart
[1:19:21] but if I'm understanding it right when
[1:19:23] John the bapti this come he wasn't just
[1:19:26] standing up there Thou shalt have no
[1:19:28] other gods before me Thou shalt not bear
[1:19:31] false witness Thou shalt not C th labors
[1:19:33] why there's no sermons that we have
[1:19:35] recorded that John ever stood up and
[1:19:38] quoted The Ten Commandments but what was
[1:19:41] John preaching he was preaching a
[1:19:44] message that was the identification of
[1:19:48] the hour and the time they lived
[1:19:51] in there's one standing among you he
[1:19:57] said that you don't
[1:20:01] know and I don't know who he is either
[1:20:05] but that one that sent me said on whom
[1:20:08] you will see the spirit of God
[1:20:10] descending it is he that baptizes with
[1:20:13] the Holy Ghost amen so you imagine now
[1:20:16] the scribes and the Pharisees that go to
[1:20:18] the synagogue and book Moses said this
[1:20:21] and Moses said that and what are they
[1:20:23] doing they're preaching backwards
[1:20:25] they're preaching history they're
[1:20:28] preaching what was not what is they're
[1:20:32] preaching history so what did they blind
[1:20:36] the people with historical
[1:20:39] truths historical truths mixed in with a
[1:20:45] little bit of skepticism a little bit of
[1:20:48] theology what I believe and this is what
[1:20:50] I think and when the present tense truth
[1:20:54] walk walked on the earth they said do
[1:20:57] away such a man will not have such a man
[1:20:59] as that rule over us why that that that
[1:21:01] John the Baptist he's a wild man he's
[1:21:03] crazy other man's absil out of his mind
[1:21:06] eat Locust and Wild Honey come out and
[1:21:09] dress like my Lord look like a hippie to
[1:21:11] me his hair all growed out and had a
[1:21:13] leather girdle on the prophet said he
[1:21:14] walked right up there before them great
[1:21:16] men and he said the the mud was
[1:21:18] squishing up between his toes now can
[1:21:20] you imagine a man walking in here
[1:21:21] tonight with a letter girdle on and and
[1:21:25] his toe tracks mud tracks falling all
[1:21:27] out that white door woo on this white
[1:21:29] carpet he said Lord have mercy oh my
[1:21:33] what in the world are you doing would we
[1:21:35] accept such a rough guy my we W hard to
[1:21:37] accept the guy that raises his voice
[1:21:40] we've got a a water down in the message
[1:21:41] of the Hour come on somebody we've got
[1:21:44] our identification of what we think it
[1:21:46] is but what is it going to be that's
[1:21:50] going to usher in will it be miracles in
[1:21:54] one sense yes will it be tapes in one
[1:21:59] sense yes will it be you Services yes
[1:22:04] will it be Church yes will it be us
[1:22:08] living right yes will it be Grace yes
[1:22:13] Faith yes power yes strength yes you see
[1:22:18] it will be a multiple aspect that God is
[1:22:23] bringing it under under the opes of the
[1:22:27] word of this
[1:22:29] hour will we still preach the cross yes
[1:22:33] will we still preach sanctification yes
[1:22:36] because some folks still ain't
[1:22:38] Sanctified yet amen will we still preach
[1:22:41] the Holy Ghost and water baptism we will
[1:22:44] will we still preach uh healing for the
[1:22:47] sick and prayer line we sure will we're
[1:22:50] going to continue to preach it but we're
[1:22:52] also going to bring it up to the home
[1:22:55] state by where we're focusing on our
[1:22:59] grand
[1:23:00] finale our grand finale is not who can
[1:23:04] have the longest prayer line our grand
[1:23:08] finale is not who can have the most
[1:23:11] excitable music or who has the greatest
[1:23:14] special singers it's us coming to our
[1:23:18] position in Christ Jesus and the word of
[1:23:22] God becoming so much
[1:23:25] of who we are that us and the
[1:23:29] word become actually
[1:23:32] one and in that day it will be I and the
[1:23:36] Father the father and me and I and you
[1:23:39] and you and me and you'll be able in
[1:23:42] that day to say I and my father are
[1:23:48] one now it's not just a good scripture
[1:23:50] or a good quote to quote but it will be
[1:23:53] a reality now how many believes in
[1:23:56] rapturing
[1:23:58] faith the Bible don't say
[1:24:05] that how many believes we need ruring
[1:24:08] Faith okay so how come you believe
[1:24:12] that why do you believe it brother why
[1:24:15] you believe it brother Joe why do we
[1:24:16] believe it Carol why do we believe we
[1:24:18] need rapturing
[1:24:20] Faith because as God unveiled his coming
[1:24:23] and perect
[1:24:24] stages we believe he's done the same
[1:24:27] thing in this day now Paul give us more
[1:24:31] about the order of the resurrection of
[1:24:32] the coming and then the rest of the
[1:24:33] Apostles did but even Paul you will not
[1:24:36] find it where Paul mentions the term
[1:24:40] rapturing Faith No rapturing strength no
[1:24:44] rapturing power nor rapturing
[1:24:48] Grace wonder why they wern't going to
[1:24:51] need it Luther didn't preach rapturing
[1:24:55] face why he wasn't going to need it but
[1:24:59] if there is an age and a group of people
[1:25:03] on the Earth that are actually going to
[1:25:06] be
[1:25:07] alive then what will they need to hear
[1:25:11] that will bring rapturing face into them
[1:25:16] what will it be rapturing face preaching
[1:25:19] now it also ties together though with
[1:25:23] healing and Miracles and prayer for the
[1:25:26] sick and so on because brother Ram says
[1:25:28] it over and over again if we cannot have
[1:25:30] enough faith for the healing of the body
[1:25:33] how can we have faith for a body change
[1:25:37] so for those in on the flip side around
[1:25:39] the message that don't believe in the
[1:25:41] Supernatural they don't believe in
[1:25:42] prayer lines they don't believe in any
[1:25:44] of that well they might as well give up
[1:25:46] on ring face because brother brandom
[1:25:49] tied that together with prayer lines and
[1:25:53] with healing and with Miracles praise
[1:25:55] the Lord but that alone is not the only
[1:25:59] answer so we could preach healing
[1:26:02] Miracles prayer lines and still not be
[1:26:06] the culmination of rapturing Faith we're
[1:26:09] just on the visible evidence of someone
[1:26:11] getting healed do you honestly believe
[1:26:14] that people only get healed in our
[1:26:17] message you can go on YouTube you can go
[1:26:19] on all kinds of these Church websites
[1:26:22] there's all kinds of people that give
[1:26:24] healed in Pentecostal churches in
[1:26:26] Baptist churches and all kinds of places
[1:26:29] there's people that's come through our
[1:26:30] prayer lines right here that did not
[1:26:33] believe this message didn't believe it
[1:26:35] when they got prayed for and do not
[1:26:38] believe it now one of the great Miracles
[1:26:40] that brother Matt Watkins shared with
[1:26:42] you and showed you the picture of the
[1:26:44] man that God healed with cancer remember
[1:26:45] that during the meeting that man never
[1:26:48] did accept the
[1:26:50] message an absolute tremendous miracle
[1:26:54] and God it was not through his church
[1:26:57] that they prayed for him it was through
[1:26:59] the ministry of men who believe the
[1:27:01] message of the hour and that man never
[1:27:04] did embrace the message and passed away
[1:27:06] a year or so ago so the healing is not
[1:27:10] just for message people well if Divine
[1:27:13] Healing alone is the Forerunner of the
[1:27:16] body chains then that means Pentecostals
[1:27:18] are going to get it too and don't even
[1:27:20] believe the message so they make fun of
[1:27:21] the prophet and life at the prophet and
[1:27:23] say well glory to God I got healed so it
[1:27:25] means I'm going to get a body change no
[1:27:27] it
[1:27:28] doesn't so you know the prophet in
[1:27:31] bringing this and he started way back in
[1:27:34] the 50s and he coined the term of
[1:27:37] rapturing faith I want you he said but
[1:27:41] God's just now loosening up the church
[1:27:43] everywhere look at this date
[1:27:46] 32653 getting in order now so he can get
[1:27:50] it into the Rapture got to give it
[1:27:54] rapturing face before it can go in the
[1:27:59] Rapture so God has to give an element of
[1:28:03] people a rapturing faith before they go
[1:28:06] on the Rapture the people are in the
[1:28:08] spirit of the last days like they was in
[1:28:11] the days of Noah eating drinking
[1:28:13] marrying giving in marriage
[1:28:16] unconcerned don't care walking around
[1:28:20] anything else he said and these American
[1:28:23] people
[1:28:24] is the worst on the face of the
[1:28:29] earth now look what we as Americans have
[1:28:32] to deal
[1:28:33] with God's Prophet identifies us as the
[1:28:38] worst on the face of the Earth of being
[1:28:41] nonchalant non-caring whatever just
[1:28:45] whatever that's part of what you and I
[1:28:47] will have to fight in leosa well it
[1:28:51] don't matter if I go to church if I
[1:28:53] don't if I pray if I reading my Bible it
[1:28:54] don't remember that's the spirit of the
[1:28:57] worst people on the Earth not the bride
[1:29:01] Hallelujah come on now you folks that
[1:29:03] are proud to be Americans and these
[1:29:06] American people is the worst on the face
[1:29:08] of the Earth hey High minded incontinent
[1:29:12] Fierce despisers know it all boy that
[1:29:16] describes a bunch of the message folks
[1:29:18] on it know it all if there's any place
[1:29:20] in the world when my Bible over my heart
[1:29:23] God knowing I look down on me I know I
[1:29:25] may have to stand before him before
[1:29:26] morning if I have to say so the place
[1:29:29] needs missionaries worse than any place
[1:29:32] in the world is the
[1:29:34] USA well if he would say that in 1953
[1:29:38] what would he say in
[1:29:40] 2024 friends our nation has gone to the
[1:29:43] dogs it's said right brother Tim said
[1:29:46] it's a rat race and the rats are the
[1:29:48] only one
[1:29:49] winning well praise the Lord notice
[1:29:53] needs mission is worse than any place in
[1:29:55] the world is the USA the United States
[1:29:58] of America the greatest bunch of
[1:30:01] heathens that I know of anywhere is
[1:30:04] America heathan means
[1:30:08] unbeliever woo so this is part of the
[1:30:11] spirit that you and I have to contend
[1:30:15] with every day of our life that's the
[1:30:18] spirit of America unbeliever oh know it
[1:30:22] all you can't hold tell a lot of message
[1:30:25] folks know anything they know it all you
[1:30:27] can't hardly give them no quote you go
[1:30:29] to start quote one they'll finish it for
[1:30:31] you you can't correct them on this that
[1:30:33] and the other I hope and pray to God we
[1:30:36] never get to that place cuz when we do
[1:30:38] we are finished when we get to a place
[1:30:42] we cannot be corrected by the word come
[1:30:44] on somebody the greatest bunch of
[1:30:47] heathens that I know of anywhere is in
[1:30:50] America Heathen means unbeliever I truly
[1:30:54] believe before the church can have the
[1:30:57] Rapture it's got to have rapturing fa we
[1:31:02] can't even have faith for Divine Healing
[1:31:07] let alone rapturing Faith Now watch how
[1:31:10] it ties together got to have a faith
[1:31:13] that'll change and Quicken this body and
[1:31:16] be taken away so no doubt God knew that
[1:31:20] the message would come through a cycle
[1:31:23] for many many years to where the
[1:31:26] supernatural would be fult the
[1:31:28] supernatural would be stood against the
[1:31:31] supernat would be laughed at and made
[1:31:33] fun of I'm talking about from message
[1:31:35] pulpits and that if you believed in a
[1:31:38] move of God you was a Pentecost and you
[1:31:42] absolutely did not believe the message
[1:31:44] but in the last few years that has
[1:31:47] changed is that right and it's like
[1:31:50] there has been an Awakening of the
[1:31:53] supernatural
[1:31:54] and there are meetings going on
[1:31:56] everywhere and don't get in your mind
[1:31:59] that there's two or three churches in
[1:32:00] America is the only one where God is
[1:32:03] moving you need to broaden and take your
[1:32:05] blinders off you got blinders on you and
[1:32:08] you only look at it two three preachers
[1:32:10] you need to get rid of them blinders God
[1:32:13] is moving around the
[1:32:14] world I said God is moving around the
[1:32:19] world this is a bride move so it's not
[1:32:22] just going to happen in brother Tim's
[1:32:24] Ministry or brother Tim's church or
[1:32:26] brother Ron's Ministry brother Ron's
[1:32:29] Church alone a Word of Life Church if
[1:32:31] it's a bride Ministry it's going to
[1:32:33] happen around the world well come on now
[1:32:37] oh I know a lot of preachers don't like
[1:32:38] to testify of other healings and
[1:32:41] miracles and signs and wonders that
[1:32:43] happen in any place beside their church
[1:32:46] because it's like they're blowing the
[1:32:48] trumpet about their signs and their
[1:32:49] wonders and their miracles but I like to
[1:32:52] hear a man talk about God moving down in
[1:32:55] Murphy's Boro Tennessee I like to hear
[1:32:58] God a man of God stand in the pull pit
[1:33:00] and he's not ashamed to hear God God
[1:33:03] great power working over in South Africa
[1:33:06] or in India we ought to reach out a
[1:33:08] little bit more to keep that pride and
[1:33:10] arrogance off of us to where we think
[1:33:12] we're the only ones well just in case
[1:33:15] you think we are let me just give you a
[1:33:17] heads up tonight I'm in contact with
[1:33:20] people all over this world God is
[1:33:22] Healing The Sick God is raising the dead
[1:33:25] God is performing Miracles God is doing
[1:33:28] great signs come on somebody it ain't
[1:33:31] just amongst the white folks it ain't
[1:33:34] just amongst a few uh you know prized
[1:33:36] American preachers it's going on around
[1:33:39] the world remember the bride will be
[1:33:42] Universal will there be healings
[1:33:44] Universal that will forerun the Rapture
[1:33:47] amen will there be Miracles that will
[1:33:50] forun the Rapture amen but not Miracles
[1:33:55] alone not Miracles
[1:33:59] alone now listen he says I believe
[1:34:03] there's a
[1:34:04] church on its Road
[1:34:07] tonight a power of the Living
[1:34:11] God that men will speak the
[1:34:15] word here and
[1:34:18] there and it will
[1:34:21] flash like lightning
[1:34:25] I want you to
[1:34:27] notice he doesn't say
[1:34:31] Amen
[1:34:33] singular and he doesn't just say
[1:34:37] here and he happened to be at the
[1:34:39] brandom
[1:34:40] Tabernacle but he said here and there
[1:34:44] now this is what I hear when I press
[1:34:47] play I don't understand why other folks
[1:34:49] don't hear that when they press play
[1:34:51] unless they don't play this tape
[1:34:54] well Glory I believe there's a church on
[1:34:57] its Road tonight a power of the Living
[1:34:59] God that men men will speak the word
[1:35:04] here and there it'll flash like
[1:35:06] lightning and a church is coming out not
[1:35:09] a psychologist not some of this put on
[1:35:13] make belief but a real true genu
[1:35:18] anointed Holy Ghost called out church
[1:35:22] and then he says that beautiful word
[1:35:23] that we all love so
[1:35:26] much notice again I believe that the age
[1:35:30] has come now the miraculous the
[1:35:33] phenomenal the baptism of the spirit and
[1:35:36] power and signs and wonders this great
[1:35:40] pouring out of God's spirit in the last
[1:35:43] days and that's the thing that'll bring
[1:35:46] Faith into the people that'll take a
[1:35:51] rapturing face
[1:35:54] notice he never says that it'll just be
[1:35:57] cold dead theology or just cold dead
[1:36:02] Bible studies alone or repeating of the
[1:36:06] Bible stories he ties it over and over
[1:36:09] again with a move of the Supernatural
[1:36:12] and the phenomenal now anybody that says
[1:36:14] I don't believe in the phenomenal is a
[1:36:16] ball fa liar I do believe in the
[1:36:18] phenomenal but I'm not going to stop
[1:36:20] there I'm the ultimately what I'm
[1:36:23] looking for more is the change of this
[1:36:25] body not just to get it healed in case
[1:36:28] you all hadn't noticed it I've crossed
[1:36:30] the border I am an old man now so I
[1:36:33] don't just need healing every now and
[1:36:35] then I'm wanting to be a young man Big
[1:36:38] Time amen praise the Lord I said I'm
[1:36:40] want to be a young man and I'm W you all
[1:36:44] to be young with me I believe in healing
[1:36:46] I told you before I've had healing I've
[1:36:48] had miracles in my Ministry since I was
[1:36:51] a boy preacher Miracles are not
[1:36:53] something new to me I've experienced all
[1:36:55] kinds of them I've never even shared
[1:36:57] with you all one little tiny bit of what
[1:37:00] God's done through my Ministry through
[1:37:01] the years I believe in all of that but
[1:37:04] that's not the head I'm not stopping at
[1:37:08] Miracles it's only a step to Lead Me
[1:37:11] Higher to the great miracle of the body
[1:37:15] chains I don't want to just talk about
[1:37:17] healing I don't want to just talk about
[1:37:19] prayer line and act as if though that's
[1:37:22] the finale that that is not the
[1:37:26] finale oh my how can the church be
[1:37:29] raptured notice as God talked to Moses
[1:37:31] paragraph 25 how can the church be
[1:37:34] raptured when we haven't even got enough
[1:37:36] faith for healing we've got to have
[1:37:39] rapturing faith first that's right how
[1:37:43] that God moves by his Spirit signs and
[1:37:46] wonders now notice again how he ties
[1:37:50] rapturing the precursor the Forerunner
[1:37:52] of that is going to be a supernatural
[1:37:55] move among us look friend you may wonder
[1:37:57] why why y'all talking about it brother
[1:37:59] Donnie why do you want it well if you'll
[1:38:01] study the message and you'll see the way
[1:38:03] the prophet was leading up to it you
[1:38:06] realize he was not telling us now
[1:38:07] there's going to come a time it'll be
[1:38:09] real dry and there won't be no move of
[1:38:12] God there will be no move of the spirit
[1:38:14] and everybody will just go to church and
[1:38:16] they'll sit there just struggle to stay
[1:38:18] awake and the Mysteries will be so deep
[1:38:20] and so profound and everybody will sleep
[1:38:23] I way through the service and then
[1:38:25] they'll get up and go out they'll go
[1:38:26] there to the gym and they'll have coffee
[1:38:28] and they'll have a few Donuts every now
[1:38:29] and then and they're going to talk but
[1:38:31] oh some glorious day rapturing Faith is
[1:38:34] coming well you show me where he said
[1:38:36] that and I'll preach it next Wednesday
[1:38:38] night but until he does I'm going to
[1:38:40] preach this this Wednesday night cuz I
[1:38:42] know he didn't say that nobody so I'm
[1:38:44] going to go and preach this so he foran
[1:38:47] this with what that you one way you'd be
[1:38:50] able to know it but notice the
[1:38:52] difference between this and isusa street
[1:38:55] isusa street went to seed on the element
[1:38:59] of the supernatural that they had so
[1:39:01] they went no farther so when God brought
[1:39:03] Malachi for on the scene what did they
[1:39:06] do oh we don't need no Prophet we ain't
[1:39:07] follow no Prophet glory to God we speak
[1:39:10] in tongu oh he's against women he he's
[1:39:12] trying to put the gifts in the backround
[1:39:14] you know it just absolutely blows my
[1:39:16] mind that preachers in this message will
[1:39:18] spend hours hours and they will study
[1:39:22] hundreds of quotes to prove that we need
[1:39:25] the gifts back in the church and then
[1:39:27] they will deny the same prophets
[1:39:30] teaching of how the gifts ought to be
[1:39:32] operated in the church now somebody
[1:39:35] please enlighten me I tell you what it
[1:39:38] is I don't need much Enlightenment
[1:39:39] you're picking what you want you're
[1:39:42] picking and choosing and the message is
[1:39:44] like a cafeteria to you so you take the
[1:39:47] quote you want and somebody else was in
[1:39:50] womit the prophet said well well well
[1:39:52] our church is Sovereign so what do you
[1:39:54] mean by being Sovereign you mean you
[1:39:56] take what you want so what if that quote
[1:39:59] you left out is one of those required
[1:40:01] for the
[1:40:03] Rapture how do you know do you have
[1:40:05] Rapture and non Rapture quotes in your
[1:40:08] books apparently I didn't get those
[1:40:10] books I mean my mind just come plain old
[1:40:12] plaino whenever I I pull it up on my
[1:40:14] phone I share it every day with somebody
[1:40:16] around the world and I don't have
[1:40:18] Rapture quotes and non-existent Rapture
[1:40:20] quotes there I guess I don't understand
[1:40:22] where people coming from well yeah I
[1:40:23] guess I really do it's because they
[1:40:25] exalt their own understanding above the
[1:40:27] teaching of the prophet of God the
[1:40:29] bottom line is they think they know more
[1:40:31] about the gifts you got to be kidding me
[1:40:33] so we as pastors know more about how
[1:40:36] gifts ought to be operated in a church
[1:40:38] than a godsent prophet with the
[1:40:40] restoration of the word you mean He
[1:40:42] restored water baptism He restored the
[1:40:45] godhead He restored all this other stuff
[1:40:47] and he still remained a Baptist when it
[1:40:50] come to the rest of the GI come on
[1:40:51] children how in the world could you even
[1:40:54] follow a man under that opes if that's
[1:40:57] what you believe if the man did not have
[1:40:59] the correct understanding of the gifts
[1:41:02] how do I know he had the correct
[1:41:03] understanding about rapturing faith
[1:41:05] since the Bible don't use that
[1:41:10] term that's one thing I love about the
[1:41:13] Lord Jesus now he can get pretty sharp
[1:41:15] of that word boy he can
[1:41:19] burn we ain't got a fire in your have
[1:41:22] I'm I'm smelling something
[1:41:24] oh it's preacher hi that's what it is oh
[1:41:26] okay yeah it's preacher hi oh my now
[1:41:30] notice how he links this so if the
[1:41:33] restoration of gifts and great
[1:41:35] phenomenal and shouting and running and
[1:41:39] jumping if that's all required I don't
[1:41:43] understand why Zeus's stre didn't have
[1:41:45] the the
[1:41:46] Rapture I don't understand why a Allen
[1:41:49] didn't have it h Richard Hall T OS me
[1:41:53] many of the men that I knew back there
[1:41:55] they the ter I don't understand why they
[1:41:57] did not produce rapal because there's
[1:41:59] not a man in this message not a
[1:42:02] one that ever had the Miracles now some
[1:42:05] of the men I just mentioned their name
[1:42:10] by
[1:42:12] never I ain't talking about a few here
[1:42:15] and there I'm talking about
[1:42:17] thousands
[1:42:19] thousands oh my well if just the healing
[1:42:23] will bring rapturing Faith somebody tell
[1:42:26] me why are we still
[1:42:28] here cuz it's got to be coupled was a
[1:42:35] message so when the preachers are
[1:42:37] preaching and they're laying out what's
[1:42:39] going to be needed then God comes along
[1:42:42] they lay their hands on the sick and
[1:42:44] blood clots goes out of people's
[1:42:48] bodies well it happened to Brother Brad
[1:42:50] Gilbert a few days
[1:42:52] ago three in his
[1:42:55] lungs now they're
[1:42:57] gone had a heart attack several years
[1:42:59] ago texted me back on Sunday said oh
[1:43:01] yeah I forgot to remind you and tell you
[1:43:03] I had a heart attack damage on my heart
[1:43:05] but he said when I was in the hospital
[1:43:06] they got to check on my heart and the
[1:43:07] doctor said that wouldn't even no sign
[1:43:09] of that heart attack they also diagnosed
[1:43:12] him with have congestive heart failure
[1:43:14] and the doctor did an x-ray and all that
[1:43:16] stuff and he said you ain't got no more
[1:43:18] congestive heart failure now what is
[1:43:20] that a sign of it's a sign that the
[1:43:22] Great Resurrection is in our midst but
[1:43:26] now I'm not going to stop just on that
[1:43:28] and go out everywhere I go preach and
[1:43:30] repeat that miracle and repeat that
[1:43:32] miracle and repeat that Miracle that's
[1:43:34] good I love for people to hear it and
[1:43:36] say it but there's got to be a message
[1:43:39] that's going to bring that plus more if
[1:43:43] not we're going straight back to
[1:43:46] Pentecost and then we just jump and
[1:43:48] shout and holler and run and glory to
[1:43:51] God this and glory to God that
[1:43:53] Hallelujah this person got healed and
[1:43:55] that person got healed and we're
[1:43:56] preaching no more than that we'll never
[1:43:59] make the Rapture unless we're hearing
[1:44:02] something that will so align our
[1:44:06] mechanics in the presence of God that
[1:44:09] when the Dynamics tried to remember let
[1:44:11] me explain to you this way when I study
[1:44:15] this sermon right here when I study I
[1:44:18] look at it from this angle and that
[1:44:20] angle and that angle and that angle and
[1:44:22] that angle and that angle and I've told
[1:44:24] you before brother Daryl was tell me
[1:44:25] Brother Don if I preach as much as you
[1:44:27] did I'd go crazy but I'm Different he's
[1:44:30] an evangelist you can't preach a 185
[1:44:32] part sermon and we during
[1:44:34] evangelist but I approach you from one
[1:44:37] angle another another another so what is
[1:44:39] that that's our mechanics and I sat back
[1:44:42] and I study and I study and I study i f
[1:44:45] my spirit with it car can tell you when
[1:44:47] I'm out preaching somewhere in the hotel
[1:44:49] room same way I don't go out and go on a
[1:44:51] tour here and a tour there I've been all
[1:44:53] over the world seen very little of it
[1:44:55] cuz when I go I go preach I go study so
[1:44:59] I sat in the room all this great scene
[1:45:00] excit over here right here is pretty
[1:45:02] seic I think I'll just tell you here in
[1:45:03] the room then when I get up then the
[1:45:06] Holy Ghost can anoint that's right what
[1:45:08] I've applied amen oh my I get just as
[1:45:11] marveled as you do and the spirit of God
[1:45:14] will going and anointing them scriptures
[1:45:15] and anointing them close I'm thinking
[1:45:17] Lord have mercy I ain't quoted them in
[1:45:19] the scriptures in 40 years where in the
[1:45:21] world did that come from but you see I
[1:45:23] was laying on the mechanics in it was
[1:45:26] already there how can the spirit strike
[1:45:29] our
[1:45:30] mechanics if we've only got two that's
[1:45:34] right sir so the spirit comes and
[1:45:38] Strikes you and say w glory to God thank
[1:45:41] you
[1:45:43] Jesus
[1:45:45] amen I wonder what it have done if You'
[1:45:47] had that many
[1:45:50] mechanics you see this is why people
[1:45:52] miss it inp special meetings oh they go
[1:45:54] so fired up and they get everything
[1:45:56] ready and then when they come back home
[1:45:57] after special meeting it's
[1:46:00] just when's the next special meeting
[1:46:03] tonight you must know got the
[1:46:08] text you must not got a notification
[1:46:10] it's tonight every night ought to be
[1:46:13] special but you see if we put as much
[1:46:16] mechanics together expectation hope
[1:46:19] believing oh we're looking for this if
[1:46:21] we' put that much mechanic mix together
[1:46:23] for Wednesday night and Sunday morning
[1:46:25] there ain't no telling what God to do
[1:46:27] right here Among
[1:46:28] Us why the spirit of God will fall on
[1:46:31] our mechanics and if we've only got one
[1:46:34] or two it just kind of
[1:46:39] fizzes and then somebody that's got a
[1:46:41] lot of mechanics the spirit of God falls
[1:46:42] on them and they're
[1:46:48] going it's a big rocket you know
[1:46:54] and you're sitting there with your
[1:46:55] little T90
[1:46:58] firecracker thank you
[1:47:01] Jesus but then the feeling's gone it
[1:47:03] don't last till church is over and then
[1:47:06] you blame God or you blame Brother Louie
[1:47:08] poor old fell ain't don't tell how much
[1:47:09] blame he carries Brother Lou was in the
[1:47:11] service tonight it was brother Harry it
[1:47:13] was brother har it was the drummers it
[1:47:15] was the piano I can't figure maybe it
[1:47:17] was you maybe it was you you didn't pray
[1:47:20] enough you didn't read the Bible enough
[1:47:22] inste of stands there running your jaw
[1:47:24] about 30 minutes before church come in
[1:47:25] here get down on your knees and pray
[1:47:27] have some Mechanics for the spirit of
[1:47:29] God to be able to annoy your mechanics
[1:47:32] don't you understand that's what we want
[1:47:34] we want the spirit of God not only
[1:47:36] healing our
[1:47:39] sick we want the spirit of God so
[1:47:42] grabbing a hold of our
[1:47:46] face if the prophet believed there was a
[1:47:48] church in the making then what about now
[1:47:52] let me close we got to have rapturing
[1:47:54] faith first that's right how that moves
[1:47:56] by his Spirit signs wonders begin to
[1:48:00] follow everywhere God begins to move
[1:48:02] signs and wonders
[1:48:06] follows
[1:48:08] God God's provided
[1:48:11] way that he might bring the Believers
[1:48:14] than you to a rapturing
[1:48:18] facei God's way his provided way is to
[1:48:23] bring
[1:48:24] Believers to rapturing Faith
[1:48:28] yes oh there might be somebody streaming
[1:48:31] tonight and they're say now brother
[1:48:34] Donnie well I have the answer to all
[1:48:38] that rapturing
[1:48:40] faith is on the
[1:48:44] tapes really now I'll tell you what I'm
[1:48:47] going to do I'm going to give you a few
[1:48:50] days hear me tonight GL globally I will
[1:48:54] give anyone in the world
[1:49:02] 10,000 to show me where God's Prophet
[1:49:06] said rapturing
[1:49:09] face is on the
[1:49:16] tapes I might have been born in the
[1:49:18] morning but it wasn't this morning
[1:49:23] people make him say that the seven ther
[1:49:28] people oh yes this is rapturing Faith
[1:49:30] this is it the peria people this is it
[1:49:33] this is it how many brides revivals have
[1:49:36] we
[1:49:37] had and now we're having a surge of
[1:49:39] another one oh this is it right here
[1:49:41] it's the shouting it's the running it's
[1:49:43] the jumping it's what it's this this
[1:49:45] this this oh Lord and the sad part about
[1:49:49] it is every one of them had a little bit
[1:49:51] of Truth
[1:49:53] but you see a little bit of Truth won't
[1:49:55] get you off this
[1:49:57] world we have got this big gigantic
[1:50:02] spaceship it's going to contain millions
[1:50:06] of
[1:50:09] passengers millions of
[1:50:12] passengers are going to be on board this
[1:50:16] flight some of them are actually in
[1:50:18] another dimension and they will have to
[1:50:21] fly from that Dimension down here on the
[1:50:25] tarmac of time in order to meet up with
[1:50:29] the rest of
[1:50:30] us and millions of us will get
[1:50:35] together and then we're going to take
[1:50:38] this flight into the
[1:50:41] sky so it's going to take a little bit
[1:50:44] more than an emotion and a feeling and
[1:50:46] fast
[1:50:47] music it's going to take a power that's
[1:50:50] right like we have never known
[1:50:57] before let's
[1:50:59] stand Welly some of y'all ain't search
[1:51:02] the message in Forever some of you

[1:51:30] hate to be the bearer of bad news but he
[1:51:33] actually didn't say
[1:51:37] it but you see that would be the easy
[1:51:40] way that's what we want that's what
[1:51:43] people look for so you just listen and
[1:51:47] someh you get it for others it's oh I
[1:51:48] believe in Preachers I believe in going

[1:52:22] it's the absolute in Jeffersonville 1962
[1:52:25] 1230 let me just go ahead and read it um
[1:52:29] so poor brother Jackie won't be
[1:52:31] receiving so many phone calls and emails
[1:52:33] in the morning Revival fires have been
[1:52:36] built for 15 years on nearly every
[1:52:39] Mountain Divine Healing just you can
[1:52:42] check me out that's fine I have no
[1:52:44] problem with that but type in rapturing
[1:52:46] faith and tapes you'll not find there's
[1:52:49] one quote in the message where it's
[1:52:52] mentioned
[1:52:56] together Divine Healing across the
[1:52:58] Nations and the power and restoration
[1:53:00] now I
[1:53:03] believe she's
[1:53:06] ready to strike that final climax Yonder
[1:53:10] to bring forth a Rapture that'll a faith
[1:53:13] that'll Rapture the church into
[1:53:16] Glory she who
[1:53:23] notice I believe she's ready to strike
[1:53:28] that final climax hter to bring forth
[1:53:30] the faith that a Rapture the church into
[1:53:32] Glory it's the
[1:53:33] truth and she's
[1:53:38] laying in the
[1:53:41] messages she
[1:53:45] who now that's the quote that people
[1:53:48] have preached for years that Rapture and
[1:53:51] Faith lady on the T it ain't even
[1:53:53] nothing like what people
[1:53:55] quoted let's just say what he said when
[1:53:59] we press play on this let's just go
[1:54:01] ahead and repeat it
[1:54:03] she she ready to strike to final climax
[1:54:07] on her to bring forth a faith that'll
[1:54:09] Rapture the church into Glory it's the
[1:54:11] TR and she's
[1:54:14] laying
[1:54:15] in the
[1:54:18] messages and the church said
[1:54:22] how many believes it will strike the
[1:54:25] Bride of Jesus Christ rapturing
[1:54:29] faith will it be healing that'll be an
[1:54:31] element of it will it be more truth an
[1:54:34] element of it another element will be
[1:54:37] you seeing who you
[1:54:41] are not just seeing that you're a
[1:54:43] housewife that you're a husband a farmer
[1:54:45] a factory worker that true because
[1:54:47] you've got to have faith in who you are
[1:54:48] instead of living your whole life well I
[1:54:50] I'm still looking for my place some of
[1:54:51] you's been in for 30 years and looking
[1:54:54] for something else cuz you don't think
[1:54:56] that you're in your place yet you
[1:54:58] understand as long as you're there you
[1:54:59] can't have that perfect Faith to know
[1:55:02] every day I'm doing what God wants me to
[1:55:04] do I'm a housewife I'm making beds I'm
[1:55:07] changing sheets I'm scrambling eggs I'm
[1:55:09] making chocolate milk I'm making apple
[1:55:11] pies I'm I'm doing this is what God
[1:55:13] wants me to do I'm living the word and
[1:55:16] if I can do anything at the church I'm
[1:55:17] there to do whatever I can do that gives
[1:55:19] you faith in your position then you have
[1:55:22] confidence in who you are it ain't like
[1:55:25] you're waiting for some great phenomenal
[1:55:26] something to go oh I'm going to this
[1:55:28] meeting I'm going to that meeting and
[1:55:29] have people to prophesy and tell me who
[1:55:31] I am H what the prophet said generally
[1:55:35] your position is revealed to you by the
[1:55:38] Holy Ghost God don't use some man to
[1:55:41] tell you you're called to preach God
[1:55:43] calls
[1:55:47] you and when you know who you are then
[1:55:51] you can lay your hand on your baby's
[1:55:53] head at night when you can't get a hold
[1:55:54] of me and can't get a hold of some of
[1:55:55] these other preachers you can say Satan
[1:55:58] in the name of Jesus take your hand off
[1:56:01] of my
[1:56:02] baby why you got confidence in who you
[1:56:07] are how many wants it with all your
[1:56:10] heart praise
[1:56:13] God thank you Lord Jesus let's bow our
[1:56:17] heads
[1:56:19] together praise the Lord
[1:56:24] heavenly father as
[1:56:26] we look at these things
[1:56:29] tonight we Ponder we
[1:56:33] think Lord Jesus we certainly want all
[1:56:38] of our
[1:56:39] mechanics to be properly
[1:56:42] aligned we want Doctrine your Prophet
[1:56:45] has taught us that we can't even be a
[1:56:47] church without
[1:56:50] Doctrine so Doctrine is more than Divine
[1:56:54] Healing Doctrine is more than
[1:56:57] Miracles Doctrine is more than just God
[1:57:00] sent a prophet so we have to have a
[1:57:01] Doctrine to be a
[1:57:03] church so we must have Doctrine we must
[1:57:05] have
[1:57:07] correction and anywhere you are there's
[1:57:10] always
[1:57:12] Supernatural Lord God we have
[1:57:15] testified we have seen you do one thing
[1:57:18] after another after another it
[1:57:20] encourages our hearts
[1:57:23] and this is why Lord I always try to
[1:57:25] come back and get them not to focus on
[1:57:27] the man that prayed the
[1:57:30] prayer CU a prophet two or three
[1:57:33] different times in his ministry had to
[1:57:36] refocus because he got the people
[1:57:38] pointed toward the
[1:57:40] gift and it said pointed more toward the
[1:57:43] sign than the city itself so the sign
[1:57:46] was pointing to the city and he said he
[1:57:49] should have been pointing to the city
[1:57:51] instead to the the
[1:57:53] sign that's the way with humans so they
[1:57:56] want this man to pray for them or that
[1:57:58] man to pray for them because we tend to
[1:58:01] Rally around
[1:58:02] people Lord God we want to Rally around
[1:58:05] you yes we thank you for the men gifted
[1:58:08] men that's among us we're
[1:58:11] grateful
[1:58:13] Hallelujah Lord Jesus we worship you
[1:58:16] tonight
[1:58:17] father your Prophet tells us in perfect
[1:58:20] faith that we long to see these
[1:58:23] Apostolic times moving Among Us he said
[1:58:27] we see it but we want to see more of
[1:58:32] it that's the way I feel tonight Lord we
[1:58:37] see it but I want to see more of it but
[1:58:40] I want to see
[1:58:42] it in the right way I don't want to see
[1:58:45] it and then following it I hear the
[1:58:47] people talking about me or talking about
[1:58:51] brother Daryl or talking about brother
[1:58:53] Pete and one of these other
[1:58:54] brothers whenever I hear that I know
[1:58:57] right then we're not seeing at the right
[1:59:02] way your Prophet even quoted it as I
[1:59:05] read it today and
[1:59:06] said the way we're doing it makes me
[1:59:09] wonder if he's pleased with
[1:59:11] it so we rally around this man or that

[2:09:09] brother Don was talking about the girl
[2:09:11] with a I believe she was a French
[2:09:13] Canadian and the prophet said what color
[2:09:15] of eyes and she said blue and the the
[2:09:18] the lord gave her blue eyes uh here a
[2:09:21] few years ago I was in St Carlos Pache
[2:09:24] Indian reservation and there's an
[2:09:26] elderly sister there who wanted to tell
[2:09:28] me something and so I sat down beside
[2:09:31] her and she told me that when brother
[2:09:32] Brenham came there she was a little girl
[2:09:35] and they had the prayer line and there
[2:09:38] was so many that they couldn't if you've
[2:09:39] been to the church it's small church so
[2:09:41] they had it outside and she said being a
[2:09:43] young girl I was setting up close to the
[2:09:45] front and said they had all the Indians
[2:09:47] sitting on blankets because there just
[2:09:49] wasn't enough room for the people to be
[2:09:52] inside she said I was sitting and said
[2:09:54] about the fourth one that came through
[2:09:56] the line was a little girl who was deaf
[2:10:00] and dumb had never spoke a word or heard
[2:10:04] a word in her life and she said the
[2:10:08] prophet had this uh interpreter who was
[2:10:10] a an Apache a female Apache who was
[2:10:12] interpreting for brother brandham and
[2:10:15] she said I standing there I was watching
[2:10:18] and the little girl came up and the
[2:10:20] prophet prayed for her and said she
[2:10:23] began to
[2:10:25] speak and said the prophet turned to The
[2:10:27] Interpreter and said now she'll speak
[2:10:29] better after a while because it sound
[2:10:30] like all the words were just going
[2:10:32] together and said now she'll talk better
[2:10:34] after a while and The Interpreter said
[2:10:36] she talk keep good
[2:10:39] now it said the little girl was speaking
[2:10:42] Apache oh
[2:10:45] God that may not do nothing for you but
[2:10:47] that just stirs my heart here's a little
[2:10:50] Apache girl who had never heard a word
[2:10:52] in her life and the first word she ever
[2:10:54] spoke it wasn't French it wasn't Spanish
[2:10:57] it wasn't English come on somebody she
[2:10:59] spoke Apache you know why cuz she was an
[2:11:02] Apache

[2:11:06] that for his does not he care enough to
