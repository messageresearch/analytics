just glad you're not going to hell rest of you glad you are let me ask that again am it's glad you're not going to hell ah praise the Lord heavenbound people I love preaching to heavenbound people I preached to a bunch of H Hellbound people in my life I really don't like doing it to them it's a really sad thing whenever you have to preach to people that's going to hell and they don't care they want to go to hell or at least twise they think it if they'd really be able to look at it realistically they wouldn't want to go would they no and I'm so grateful that the Lord has helped us to be able to see we don't want to go we don't have to go praise the Lord but brother Donnie what if I'm not bride you still don't have to go to hell if you're not bright if you want to go to heaven God has got to make a way for you to get there well where will I live well that's according to where you where you live and all that election of God and all that stuff I'd rather live outside the city and have eternal life to be in a lake of fire and be destroyed wouldn't you yes I sure would God bless you how is everybody tonight wonderful doing good praise the lord well we come to have church tonight didn't we did I'm so grateful that the Lord is U so mindful of us and helping us to be able to live in this Evil dark dark time that we're living in but it's a paradox in the age that we are the prophet tells us it's the greatest of all ages and yet the darkest of all the ages that's ever been so I'm grateful that God has given us light that we'd be able to walk by can you imagine where you'd be tonight if it wasn't for the grace and the mercy of God some of you might be out running around drinking you might be doping you might be who knows where you in the world you'd be but God in his Mercy has shined upon us and given us Grace let's turn if you would tonight to the Book of Genesis certainly appreciate the presence of the Lord and knowing that he's so um so mindful of us and believing that he's going to come once again I don't know about you but uh we just had church here Sunday but here it is Wednesday and I need him again yeah amen oh as a matter of fact I needed him Monday yes and I needed him yesterday and I needed him today before I got to church I sure need him now and I just know me well enough to know I'll need him again tomorrow and Friday and Saturday and so on and so on and so on but to me the way I look at that that does that does not humble me as far as the world is concerned all that religion thing that's just that's just the people that aren't educated that's just the people that use that for an excuse no I'm not using it for an excuse I'm using it for a way out of this mess where because it's the only way that there is out how many knows that's the truth I'll tell you the darkness that's around us every day friends I I just don't know I don't know how in the world that people live and make it every day praise the Lord Book of Genesis we'll read together Lord willing question answers again um again tomorrow night and uh you young people now you just have to let me know if you get tired of them I'll quit then we'll do something else but I've got um I've still got several um questions that people have given me so I want to deal with them unless y'all just say hey brother Donnie would you stop if you all do that I'll say okay I'll stop and then I'll pick up again so as long as y all acting like you even halfway enjoy it I'm going to keep on going with them cuzz I've really enjoyed uh studying them to be honest with you and it's been a it's been a blessing to me God bless you let's turn to uh Genesis want to read a little bit about the and Del Lu instruction here my my computer is um kind of acting up on me my iPad rather but that's all right I've got one another one in the back and I've also got it on my phone so don't get nervous okay God bless you let's turn there to Genesis chap 6 verse 5 I want to speak to you tonight on the spirit of the last days the spirit of the last days Genesis 6 verse 5 now listen carefully as we read this because it's a it was an end time whenever this was actually written about now there's been many end times down through time so it was an end of this and an end of that that and an end of something else so this is not the first end time and what we're going to read about is an end time uh the an deluvian destruction and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually so once you think about how bad that it was prior to the flood that man's heart was constantly on evil it wasn't every now and then that evil would come to him and they fight it and battle against it but constantly his heart was only and the thoughts of his Hearts was only evil and it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart and the Lord said I will destroy man what a terrible time it must have been whom I have created from the face of the Earth both man and Beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air now want you notice it was a Dominion that God left out of this destruction man Beast creeping thing and fowls of the air anybody know where that Dimension was left out Waters God didn't say he destroy the fish no God didn't say destroy the inhabitants of the rivers and the lakes and the oceans but the fouls of the air of the beast of the field for it repenteth me that I have made them verse eight but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord the first time this precious wonderful word is found in the Bible and Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord now let me read this to you from show us the father and I want you to listen this is preached in June the 10th of 1953 looking around at the nature of the people seeing that we're in the spirit of the last day they had to get in the spirit of the anti deluvian world before they could be destroyed now think of this so they had to be an anointing that would be on the Earth and the people had to get under that before God could ever justly destroy every human being but Noah in his family I think of it Millions times millions of people men women newborns toddlers pre-teens teenagers annihilated God cannot do such a thing until the conditions are so horrific that there's no way back now notice they had to get in the spirit of the and deluvian world before they could be destroyed they have to be in the spirit of War before they can have war God let us be in the spirit of Christ tonight so we can have Christ amen ain't that wonderful so you can't have War to get in the spirit of War you can't have a flood to get the spirit of and delion destruction so that's what the world is going to get into but let us get in the spirit of Christ so we can have what war trouble Christ Christ let us be in the spirit of repentance a spirit of Faith give it to us tonight Our Father of these great Treasures of Life how many let you be remembered as we pray Lord Jesus we love you so much we can look around us and see that the world is truly every day moving in the anointing of the end time I find it amazing that back in 53 and 54 that your Prophet said that the people of the world was already in the spirit of the end time but the church was not in the spirit of the end time yet so the world actually got ahead of us somehow so you had to send a prophet was a message and send a great Dynamic power power that would catch the bride up father we pray tonight that you would help us Lord open our understanding to the day and the hour that we're living in open my mouth to the words of life shut my mouth to anything that would displease you Lord we commit the service to you tonight in the name of Jesus and the Saints said amen amen God bless you BL you keep your Bible there if you'd like to follow with me in the scripture into Genesis 6: 11 let's go on reading this now about this anti deluvian world and the Earth also was corrupt before God now whenever Moses is writing about this he's not talking about the planet the dirt had not sinned the trees the animals nature it had not sinned but since man had been given the domain of Earth then God attributes man and his inheritance in the same verse the Earth also was corrupt look at what the word means to destroy go to ruin Decay be rotted rotted so the Earth also was corrupt before God and the Earth was filled with Hamas violence now I want you to think now that it didn't start out this way and it took a long time for it to get this way because from the time that Noah was born and by the time this had arrived had already been quite a long time and then we have what was called the patriarchal age so it wasn't really a government it wasn't a government like we have today there were no presidents premieres there was no Prime Ministers no popes no Bishops it was of the patriarchal order but yet the Patriarchs that loved God were very few and the further that it went to this cycle here they became less and less and no Noah was born in the right time in due season a man that God was going to use for a great great purpose the Earth had constantly being deteriorated as the population grew no way for us to know exactly how many that there were on the Earth but the prophet tells us that there was millions of people so it was quite a time of dishonesty of Corruption of rottenness of violence and man left to his own devices it's just in his Fallen nature I think there was no television there was no internet there was no radio there was no form of communication the way we have today so the rotness had proceeded how lip to ear so it took some span of time for it to get to this place God would have been unjust to have brought this flood 200 years earlier in this time frame now God would will speak about it prophetically and let people know something is fixing to happen and he will warn and he will warn and no doubt the patriarchal fathers did thus we know they did we know that under the administration of Enoch that God prophesied that there would come a time and then methusa of course when he was born and given the name methusa which was predating the flood which part of the meaning of his name is after his end the Great Waters will come so his name in his name was embedded a prophetic vision of God but by the time it comes now Enoch has gone Enos is is gone Seth is gone and the righteous are fewer and fewer the people had become so violent and corrupt God does not pay attention to their education God does not describe how brilliant they were Now by this time they had already advanced in science they had already built the hour of course not of Babel but they had started up with Pinnacles and zigurat that they were something about them trying to raise elevations in buildings and we know that the pyramids actually predated the anian destruction and it was under the administration of Eno that they built it as a matter of fact there's a chamber inside the Great pyramid which is called after the name of Enoch so it predated the anti- deluvian destruction and the further they went the more to their own wisdom and their own cunning devices that they begin to depend and the righteous people on the Earth were getting in the minority was every decade of people that came now see people were still living 800 900 years old methusa the oldest man that we have record of lived to be 969 years old by that time men had become so rotten notice that the Bible says the Earth also was corrupt before God and the Earth was filled now it wasn't just a little a little bit over here and the majority of it was righteous but violence had overtaken the good notice again in verse 12 and God looked upon the Earth and behold it was corrupt isn't this amazing now in verse 11 Moses says it was corrupt and verse 12 he says it was corrupt for All Flesh had corrupted his way upon the Earth and God said unto Noah the end now notice here where we are the end of All Flesh is come before me so here we see an end time in Genesis chapter 6 so we are not the first people to ever deal with end time conditions but we are the only people to deal with these particular end time conditions so Noah was dealing with end time conditions it was going to come the end when for many many years there were no longer be a great number of people on the Earth can you imagine the scarcity and the feeling of fear and quietness that must have been almost overwhelming when they stepped out of the ark that day and there was eight adults eight people a pair of elephants camels donkeys and so on and ate adult human beings you would hear no City sounds because there were no cities it must have been peaceful for a while but fearful as well that end time left to a total annihilation of the human race had God not preserved a seed there would have not been one human being left on the face of the Earth amen notice God again repeats this in verse 13 and God said unto Noah the end of All Flesh has come before me for the Earth is filled with Hamas violence through them and behold I will destroy them with the Earth we may wonder why the Lord has not already come for his bread no doubt there's many things that make us the timing of the coming of the Lord there may be a few names that's on the book of redemption yet that have not fully been redeemed there could be some that are saved but have not yet reive the Holy Ghost there could be some who have been saved have received the Holy Ghost but they still lack a little bit more maturity in the life before the Rapture Ready then again there could be some more foolish virgin and the long mercy of God will continue to delay until they are brought in then again there could be some Jews that are still in the Bronx or the Jewish quarter of New York and they've not yet come back to the Homeland or there could be some more mechanics of Satan's re that is not quite where it needs to be and also there could be a little bit more that needs to be added to the cup of the iniquity of the amorites because what our father is fixing to allow to happen on this Earth has never happened before nor will it ever happen again amen he must be just before he allows Russia to bomb our nation into such a place that the seventh Vision that the prophet saw he did not see skyscrapers left in New York he did not see the Hippodrome left he did not see great convention centers and great Express ways and Los Angeles but he saw craters and Blackness and Ashes and millions in America will die at one time now just keep in mind we are not that far from Oak Ridge and we sure ain't that far from NFS and we sure ain't that far from a lot of other oh I'll run and I'll hide there's only one place you can hide friend that's in Christ Jesus [Music] amen notice again the prophet says it's the spirit of anything that does the work of it anyhow the spirit of anything the people have to be in this kind of a spirit to bring the latter days the people's in the spirit of the latter days the nation s are in the spirit of the end time they've got Atomic weapons hydrogen weapons all kinds of things because it's the spirit of the day the people are in the spirit of the end time and the church is moving together under the power and the impact of the Holy Spirit and the world's running out yonder making fun scoffing laughing and they're living like the devil every day it's the spirit of the thing again he says we've got to get in the spirit of the last days when the last days are here you go to a dance hall you can't get in the spirit of dancing or they won't dance you've got to go to the church notice now so people go to a dance hall and there's a SP spirit that they will get under now there may be other people there dancing and the music may be right and they're just sitting there sitting there sitting there why because they're not under the spirit of dancing and then all of a sudden it just hits them well I want to dance now you understand what happened to them they that Spirit of dancing worldly dance got on them and then they felt like dancing well if it can happen to devils and unbelievers I believe the Holy Ghost Dance can happen to us as the people of God well praise the Lord now notice he said you've got to get in the spirit of worship before you can worship the world's got to get in the spirit of the last days before the last days can come and we're in the spirit of the last days how many believes it look at this now 1954 and God promised these things would be here and that's what things that we've got were in the last days and men and women are setting asleep and don't realize it we cannot have the last day until people gets in the spirit of the last St so what is going to be part of the prophetic utterance that will be fulfilled in the last day great Annihilation great destruction so the predominating say that people will be under is not just building now building is one of the signs of the end time but it's not the only one one of the main ones that will take precedent will be destruction so people under the in time anointing will get under the spirit of destruction and the spirit of fighting and the spirit of intimidation come on somebody and the spirit of trying to quieten people that will oppose them amen oh they believe in freedom of speech as long as it's them got the freedom and they got the speech but they don't want anybody that opposes them of course to have the same freedom and the church said notice we cannot have a healing service until people gets in the spirit of a healing service we cannot have a filling of the Holy Ghost until people gets in that kind of an atmosphere and the people was in the atmosphere in the day to bring judgment upon the Earth they were in the same atmosphere today eating drinking marrying giving in marriage and all this kind of thing like that and the glory of God is being preached and demonstrated and the power of the Holy Ghost setting for us an example of the resurrection of Jesus Christ is going to take the church into Glory just as certain as I'm standing here that's right and men are ignoring it paying no attention to it walking away from it it walking away from it walking away from it because they're in the spirit of the last day you see part of the anointing that must be releas in this our in time is that they will walk away from the truth Peter of course goes on to tell us it would have been better for them to have never known the way of righteousness then after they have known it and tasted of it as Paul says in Hebrews 6 and then to turn and walk away they would have been better off let me tell you some friends some of the folks that have walked away from this message they would have been better off to stay Baptist they would have been better off to stay Methodist that' have been better off to stay Pentecost but they come and set where the revealing of the word was breaking force and now they'll be held accountable for it but yet they can only stay there so long it's not a surprising thing to me that there had to come a falling away and our ranks in the message because it was inevitable and there's no question about it there were people sitting Among Us that were not ordained to feed this on this reveal word of the hour and it attracted their attention but yet they could not Feast upon the unfailing body word of the son of man so what must they do they must find fault somehow many of them are not going to come right out and say I was totally wrong I was deceived by these people they ain't no way they're going to say that so they've got to find fault with it some way well when they started preaching that I had to start pulling away I had to come on just go ahead and be honest you went back back to your hog trough you went back to your vomit you lying dog well praise the Lord that's what the Bible said to do as the dog went back to its vomit and the went back to her wallowing in the m so do people do when they walk away from the truth of the word of God and let me just say that's what happened in our ranks preachers have done it late people have done it they went back to their slop you know why they was a hog when they was in it and believe it or not there was a hog when they was Among Us they may have quoted quotes and they may have even stood behind the pulpit and preached it but in reality by Nature there's still an no hog that's right well that's right now notice the world has got to get like this God would be unjust to pour His wrath out upon a just people they're they've ignored him and walked away and Satan captured them now notice he must be just keep that before you for the utter Annihilation that is fixing to break force on our world for God to allow Satan to be able to come down in a way like he has never done before the condition of the earth must be worse than it was in the days of Noah it will have to be worse than it was in the days of the first crucifixion of our Lord Jesus and it is we're in the spirit of the latter days now know part of what makes people this is the one of ways we can identify them people are he High minded can't tell them nothing they know it all now do you understand you don't have to belong to a denomination to have that attitude as a matter of fact there's a lot of folks that said in message churches that's got this attitude right here and let me just tell you if you're here like tonight you better get that evil thing off of you because that is a last day anointing getting people ready for the tribulation not the Rapture the Rapture anointing does not make you and I annoy it all and that nobody can't tell us nothing come on a real child of God can be corrected anytime any day any moment any week any months by the word of God that come to me with your opinion don't come to me with your idea but if you've got something in the scripture you've got something in the message of the hour I can be corrected by the word because I have the Holy Ghost but many people in and around our ranks cannot be corrected you cannot talk to them you can't tell them anything because they have a smart elic attitude well preach brother Donnie and you can't tell them nothing well if you don't get that off of you you're going into the tribulation period he sure there's a God in heaven and the Saints said oh my the people are in the spirit of the last days just like they was in the days of Noah eating drinking marrying giving in marriage unconcerned don't care walk around and anything else and these American people is the first on the face of the Earth so do you understand my brother sister what we have to fight against I can say Amen to this quote anybody in your say Amen with me all right then that shows we at this time were the worst we were the worst our attitudes oh my goodness these American people is the worst on the face of the Earth he High minded incontinent Fierce despisers I know it all praise the Lord so I guess why y'all wish was Canadians now huh it'll be a greater miracle for us Americans to go come on all you say oh my goodness I'm an American but you've got enough birst that other burst is a word burst it ain't American it ain't African it ain't Canadian it's seed of God oh my I believe that the people are in the preparation of the light the last great destruction this world will ever know I believe we're at the end and you can speak to people you could put a Billy Graham in every city in the United States and they drank whiskey and smoke cigarettes and life hat and everything else just the same they're in the spirit of the last days and God cannot s destruction before the people are in the spirit for Destruction so if they're in the spirit for Destruction how are they going to act it out theys will start destroying so they will be concerned about destroying people's reputation people's honor they will do whatever they can do on Facebook it's just something in them it's the anointing they've got to destroy they've got to tear down well if they got a lie they got a Twist of truth whatever it is you watch people they get under that and you remember that's not the Rapture anointing that's a tribulation anointing and it's something on the people of this age and friend we will never stop it I'll never be able to preach it out of the world neither will any other man it is the spirit of the last day but I do hope I can preach it out of my sheep what's in message people that would want to destroy one another destroy people and just because they disagree with us my goodness where is our love of God inside of our hearts for one another friends oh my in the spirit for destru God never did destroy it he saying man always destroys himself our whole nation is turning to a bunch of hoodlums any boy walk around with these Brites highing off his hips 1963 any boy walking around with his britches hanging off of his hips head hanging back and his hair hanging down his neck like a miser Kennedy Waterhead haircut and going around as a hoodlum and then called that American you fallen from Grace repent and turn back to God or you'll perish and the church said that's the reason we want to get somebody in here that'll let us do anything we want to do that's the way the churches they want to elect in a pastor not a pastor that'll stand there and beat the gospel to them but they want somebody that'll let them stretch themselves in a bathing suit play Bunko in the basement live any way they want to television programs of uncensored radio ni and fils joining church and the world together come on brother Donnie preach it brother Donnie I'm behind you brother Donnie oh my watch this and the world is falling apart in streetport in another 10 to 15 years if the world shall stand if it does stand every man in streetport Every Woman you'll have to pack a gun on the street with you in your pocket to protect yourself the hoodlums I will not because I'm afraid to to ask how many are packing in this service tonight I just really hope and pray to God that you folks don't never really turn against me while I'm preaching I look like a see of one of these Services I was in New York the other week and went down through there and for Miles nothing but these teenage hoodlums with earrings in their ears ratted hair legot Tarts on girls with little bikinis they called it out on the street and the public has to give them the rideway what is the matter with this country it's because it's a sign of moral Decay a god rejected Nation what in the world would he say if he was here in 2024 oh my somebody tell me to go ahead and preach Hallelujah notice again question answer but look it isn't them real genuine born again Christian colored people I remember he's talking talking about the uprising of Martin Luther King now watch it I'd like for some of you Hypocrites I ain't talking about you now I'm talking about them that like to string these service you Hellbound creature of time if you don't read these quotes you try to project God's Prophet as being racist you will burn in hell [Music] it isn't them real born again Christian colored people that's causing all this trouble you want to condemn them for that what about some of our Renegade white kids come on somebody what about our Renegade white kids now what sauce for the goose is for the gander why our White white kids cause twice as much trouble as they have come on some of you white people can you say Amen to it or not as I said if some of you Liars if you don't read this quote when you put together your YouTube stuff you will burn in hell and this quote will stand before you at the day of judgment and I will stand there as a voice and say Lord they laugh this one out our white kids cause twice as much trouble as they have that's exactly right huh come on where's it at in our colleges oh colleges well what do you say 83064 our colleges and things like that some of our higher educated people is causing those things see his Kentucky vernacular described him this way educated idiots I know some of y'all don't like that but don't make no difference to me I ain't called to preach what you like or don't like I'm called to preach the word of God and the message of the hour and I'm going to preach it hallelujah hallelujah some of our higher educated people is causing this things have any of y'all been looking at YouTube any of you folks been read your phone since last Wednesday night have any of you been looking at what's going on how it's exploded since I stood your last Wednesday night and told you about these things I heard a senator say it today since October the 7th there has been 1,400 protest 1,400 you understand how much these parents are paying for them their kids to go to some of these upper echelon colleges some of them begins at 75,000 a year the upper ones are 96,000 a year to 108,000 a year and they're the ones out there that took down their Flags yesterday from the campus the United States flag and raised a flag of humos that's right amen sir don't you understand friends it's the end time it's the end time oh they'll calm down in a little bit yeah they'll calm down a little bit but they've done got their foot in the door now and one of the worst things they ever do is meet with them and compromise as they did earlier this morning when they did in one of the universities up in Rhode Island and they said well what do you all want tell us what you want and we'll compromise one the biggest mistakes Israel ever made when they made it years ago and they captured one of their Heroes the PLO captured one of their Heroes and they said we will never we will never meet and talk to you all but the pressure from the people they gave in and they W giving about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners for one Israeli guy cuz that's the way they look at their value of one person they would value one to 5,000 or 1 to 10 ,000 well I wish somebody would preach with me tonight but it was one of the most worst mistakes they ever done because they sent those organizations a message so if you capture them they will give in to you that's why Hamas is doing what they're doing because our president's joining sides with them a lot of our people are joining Sid well come on now don't get quiet on me and they're joining side they don't have to do all the fighting they don't have to do all the thing all they got to do send a few Folks up to New York send a few more down to Texas send a few more up to the University of Virginia and they'll do all of it for him and say long live October 7 well in case you don't know let me remind you what some of them guys did on October 7 put babies in microwave ovens and cook hooked them alive beheaded men women children raped mutilated in front of family members and then we've got people in America saying long live amamos long live October 7 well one of them found out today in Victoria Island that you can't get by of that in Canada so you know what they done arrested their hide that's a exactly what they need to do to these rich SP brats and these bunch of universities come on somebody we'll see how much free speech We Believe don't we but that's all right they'll never stop the real voice of God it will go right on not only here in time but it'll be a voice against them at the day of judgment but if they're under their anointing then what about us then we should also be under an anointing for the rapture an anointing for the resurrection an anointing that we are looking for our loved ones to appear any [Applause] day hallelujah oh but we're the upper echelon oh now now of course they got some of their parents Gathering back in this afternoon in New York and saying hey you can't do our kids that way you know how they got Young on like that cuz they did it a few years ago that got n War uhhuh some of them long-haired hippies a bunch of sissies and cowards and would never go fight for our nation I'll tell you one thing you talked to a real veteran that went over there in Fall ask them would they rather live over there in the Gaza Strip or would they rather live in C County why don't they send if they love himas so much let them move over there I'll help buy a couple of plane tickets if they're so hungry and they want to turn this into a MOS no let's just keep this like it is and you all go over there well come on somebody if you like it so well you want to turn us into them go on over there and let us alone let us live down here the way we want to live let us live a holy life a Godly life but can they do it of course not they're moving under their anointing they're screaming they're hollering my Carol and I watch a little bit of it on YouTube acting worse than a bunch of animals screaming and hollering and carrying on I told her I said it would be amazing to be able to break into that realm of that Dimension and see how many demons are around there hundreds and hundreds of them screaming and screaming and attacking the police and treating them with such dishonor and disrespect and then their parents as soon as they go down and the da is not going to prosecute them they're not going to get them for anything you know what they're going to do don't you do that again now the next time you spit on a cop don't you just do it in a more Sanctified way you know why parents are a bunch of educated idiots themselves well glory god of this evil age the world is coming heading to a climax why the spirit of lawlessness I heard a reporter today on my radio on my truck using the same word over and over again I'm so glad that we're partakers of a prophetic message you see any preacher now can be able to stand up preach it and go back and see where we are now this was being preached when it wasn't going on this was being preached har when it looked like everything was at peace this is pre 1968 this is prev Vietnam War this is in between the Korean conflict and all that so there ain't no Wars and things going on but a prophet has the ability to look out there in time no doubt he looked right out there and saw Columbia University he looked right up there and saw NYU UCLA he saw all of that taking place he saw how that it would be in the end time I'm so glad he could come back and warn us with the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and say get ready children get ready when you see this you know the time is now when you see them getting Anointed with violence and hatred get ready pack up you're fixing to leave [Applause] the world is heading to a climax a spirit of lawlessness moral Decay scientific religion has led it to a cage of every hateful and unclean bird as the Bible said second Timothy chapter 3 verse 1 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come can y'all say Amen the word translated perilous is violent Fierce wild and difficult violent Fierce wild and difficult Grievious to bear distressing Grievous to Bear distressing painful difficult hard times I tell you friends if there's ever a time to get closer to God it's now am Luke 219 but when ye shall hear of wars and commotions Russian TV gave another warning last night and they warned America of a nuclear war if they don't back out of the Middle East when you shall hear of wars and commotions confusion tumult instability a state of disorder and disturbance insurrections against order Lawless that's part of the end time the prophet tells us that the Bible says in the last days in the last days that children will rule their parents Josephus the Jewish historian to sit the Roman historian described the period immediately following the crucifixion as full of Wars crimes violences and great earthquakes notice the time frame now these men are not Christians they're not Paul they're not Peter Josephus was a Jew a great Jewish historian but became also a part of the Roman Legions and they would actually use him to write their history as well pitus was a Roman himself toito says it was a time rich in disasters horrible with battles torn with sedition Savage even in time of Peace Savage even in time of peace now listen what Jesus said but when you shall hear of wars and commotions be not terrified oh my goodness it must going to be a horrible time brother John that the Lord Jesus would have to speak to his own and say when it comes don't you all be terrified a terrified which comes of course from the root word our English word word Terror Satan is the original terrorist think friends we have people in our great universities not only them students out there but some of the Deans are out there marching with them and some of the professors who's actually taught this Tommy rot for years they're right out there with them voting it oh it's our right of free speech and they're breaking out windows taking over buildings and taking down our American flight can you imagine the soldiers that died on D-Day in Normandy beats 9,000 Graves 9,000 of our American Graves there gave their lives that we could set here tonight for the freedom of religion to be able to worship God and then we have people on these campuses take our stars and stripes down and fire a flag of a moss and another one in fatata brother Donnie if you can't make no difference why don't you just hush you're going to get us in trouble uh-uh you don't understand if I don't preach this I will get us in trouble God's going to have some men that's going to scream out against this be not terrified don't be frightened or startled indicating a strong feeling of Terror after the crucifixion all these things as these men begin to say happen Jesus in verse 10 said then he said unto them Nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and great earthquakes shall be in diverse places and famines and pestilences and fearful sights and Great Signs there shall be from Heaven sites that which strikes Terror a cause of fright Josephus relating about the signs and wonders which preceded The Taking of Jerusalem under Titus mentions that a star hang over the city of Jerusalem like a sword and an appearance like a comet and continued for a whole year so here it was hanging over Jerusalem like a sword a comet for a whole year that people being assembled to celebrate the Feast of unlimited bread at the ninth hour of the night there're Shone so great a light about the Altar and the temple that it seemed to be bright day and this continued for a half an hour fearful sights the Eastern Gate of the temple which was of solid brass and was scarcely to be shot by 20 men was seen at the sixth hour of the night to open on its own accord so this gate was so humongous and weighed so much taking 20 men to open it but in the sixth hour of the night it opens on its own accord though fastened by strong bars and bolts angels can break bars and undo bolts and could hardly be shut again before the setting of The that was seen all over the country chariots and armies fighting in the clouds you talking about God being merciful now remember there was some saints in there but that wasn't one of them caught whenever Titus come in and locked up that City cuz Jesus Jesus warned him he said pray that your flight be not in the wi he talking about the Rapture he's talking about the day when Titus is going to lay The Siege pray that your fight be not in the winter pray this pray that and them elect seed inside they say hey remember Jesus said this and Jesus said that that prophetic word of God brother John some of them went under the wall some went over the wall someone through the gate but they wouldn't one of them closed up in that denominational wall praise be to God they made it out of there them signs you imagine them saints of God as they saw that star and that sword up there in the heavens whenever they heard about the light whenever they saw all these things oh Lord Jesus is coming Lord Jesus is coming All Saints may we be the same way maybe we not sat around oh well brother Donnie we've had these protests before but there ain't never been none like what we're dealing was now we've had signs before yes but we ain't never had nothing like what we're dealing with now and it ain't going to do nothing but get worse but I hope you don't think I'm a Nut but it has to get worse before it can get better for us so I say it this way Bring it on Bring it on whatever's got to happen Lord bring it on so we can get ready to leave this world it can't be too much [Applause] longer the Roman tacitus confirms every one of the these particulars in his history the testimonies of Josephus and tacitus serve in some measure to confirm the predictions of Jesus himself verse 25 there shall be signs in the sun and the moon and the stars and upon the Earth's distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring do you know that the IC the International court is considering having Netanyahu arrested and Gant arrested of course no mention of Y yah sinir or all the rest of them Hamas heads they of it are these people nuts think of we are Israel is still having to deal with rockets on a weekly basis they're still having their people killed I'm exposing one off yesterday another one the day before how come we don't hear anybody say nothing about it don't you see friend the anointing has surged just in the last few weeks one day it'll ser words to that place and the Lord will say it's over no more it's not safe for my queen to be on the earth oh Lord there should be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distress and the word stress is anxiety of Mind such as men saw when they would try to free thems from great Calamity and Trauma that they saw were coming so it would be so great and so overwhelming with great perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring Jesus ain't talking about the Atlantic Ocean the Mediterranean the Pacific but it's a symbolism of course people Waters multitudes and it's the sea would come and one wave after another getting bigger and bigger the accumulation and the Earth will be so overwhelmed by it people will carried out to see in the spiritual sense you you see what's happening to people they're being carried out to see spiritually they're getting out in over their head they're getting involved in sin and they're getting involved in this and that and the other and they're find their s out and they're going down and they're going down they never intended to get that far the undercurrent so pulled them out Lord God men's Hearts failing them for fear looking after those things which are coming on the Earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken I don't mind telling you I would rather be in the word than even in the powers of Heaven for the powers of the heavens can and will be shaken the stars under the six seal will be shaken out of their position you imagine when them two prophets friends you understand work so close no doubt Moses and Elijah are already on the earth two men that are born like any other men and won't be the literal one necessarily but the anointing will come upon them they're already probably already here maybe living in Jerusalem maybe Beth Haven maybe down in Bea who knows exactly where they are they may not even know yet who they are but God working on them glory to God getting them ready God won't deal with both now at the same time he don't will deal with the Gentile bride and the 144,000 but remember when the angel of the Lord stepped into that building that night when the prophet of God was there remember it's the same time frame that Israel was declared a nation and the angel of God walked in and gave him his commission and in that same time frame Israel coming to her spot Harry sent me a quote before church the rent in 1957 he must have been looking at some of the events that was going on and he said it looks like our nation will join with the Arabs and when they do she's done he said you imagine 1957 what would he say if he could look around tonight oh my as barious the political and social crisis physical disturbance in the world church church politics it will get so traumatic that people will look at it and have such fear they will have heart attacks won't be able to take it because the trauma and the fear of what's going to happen while your heads are bowed let me read this verse to you from second Peter 3:7 but the heavens and the Earths which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved into fire against the day of judgment and predition of ungodly men in verse 10 he says but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise in the element shall melt with fervent heat the Earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up but this is our verse verse 12 looking for and hastening unto the coming of the day of God the coming of the day of God where in the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat oh Lord Jesus I understand that Mr Jeff Bezos the owner of Amazon Elon Musk some of these wealthiest men of the world as they are called have these places that are head so far down in the earth and titanium doors and all these different things cuz they're expecting an Annihilation and they think they've got a safe place but I'll tell you the safest place you can have tonight it's not Kryptonite it's not titanium it's not gold or silver it's feathers yeah feathers hiding under the wind of our father hallelujah praise God praise God don't you love him children don't you want to be ready don't you want to be ready signs of the times are everywhere a che I know many of you have heard about it since she was small children and SU School some of you in your 50s 60s 7s some of you pushing 80 a few of you maybe are 80 or or above and you've heard it for years and years but it's closer now than when you first believed praise be to God who ever thought that we would see the things that we're seeing now who ever thought that our nation would allow such stuff oh brother Donnie if we can just get rid of Biden and get Trump in there friends I don't care who you put in there it's beyond Redemption [Music] amen it's beyond Redemption the prophet told us in 1964 in question answers there's only one hope for the church and that's the coming of the Lord Jesus praise God praise God we worship you tonight Jesus Oh Lamb of God we ask you for your help this is our home this is where most of us were born this is the only nation many of these people have ever been in they've never even set their feet in another Nation and we're Americans as far as that would go it breaks our hearts to think of what's heading this way I can see exactly why Satan don't want this message preached I told Carol the other day I it's pretty evident to me why Satan don't want this message preached because it contains such illumination about the end time people can preach their Bible and without the light of this end time message they can still be as blind as they can be this is why he hates for this message to be preached oh but we love it father we love it Lord Jesus but Lord we have to be honest we look around and think how much worse will it be Lord what more will happen father before it comes one day we may be forced to leave YouTube We may be forced to take our services down who knows what lays before us so father we want to preach while we can yes who knows what they'll do the prophet says they'll never shut her up she'll be taken up first yes and then other things it seems as if though he alludes to there may come such a time so I don't know Lord all I know is I want to be ready for whatever we're going to face oh Jesus we love you tonight come Lord Jesus come Lord Jesus look at me children I've preached around the world and preached to many different cultures many different races of people talked to many people and the message and I have never in all my years in the ministry heard from the saints of God that they are so hungry for the coming of the Lord Jesus anybody feel that way I know for myself I I've wanted to see him come since I was a boy but I have never longed for it the way I long for it now every day I talk to him about it or you say why would you do that don't you understand one reason why I would do it God has put Souls of human beings in these hands can you imagine if God had put hundreds of souls in your hands how you would feel one day I will walk before him and I will have to give an account I don't want to fail him by the Michael I don't want him to look at me with anger in his eyes and say you didn't preach what I told you to preach you compromised you got soft I'm going to tell you the truth friends you may get mad at me sometimes but I'm going to tell you the truth I want us to stand before him that day and when we stand there we won't have to shake and tremble and be terrified we can stand there with every confidence in the message of the hour cuz I believe we were there by representation of those theophonic voices whenever they a oh my as they hollered back to the prophet of God he said I taught everything Paul said and they said we are resting on that Can We Stand Together how many he wants to be ready with all your hearts oh Lord Jesus oh Jesus father sing it for us Lord God years Lord God have come speak to every one of our hearts father the urgency first heard it told how Jesus would come back again someday someday we've heard it over and over again if back then it
