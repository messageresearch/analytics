[35:50] [music]
[35:51] I want to see.
[35:55] [music]
[36:01] Hallelujah.
[36:02] Amen. And is that your heart's desire
[36:04] that you would just see the Lord this
[36:07] weekend? [music] And maybe you've come
[36:10] with a need or an expectation or maybe
[36:12] you don't have an expectation at all.
[36:15] Well, that happens.
[36:18] I mean, I I've come to church many
[36:21] times. You've been busy and you're
[36:23] running and you're going and
[36:26] you come to church and they sing the
[36:28] songs and before you know it, you just
[36:30] the word's coming forth. But maybe as we
[36:33] start
[36:34] &gt;&gt; [music]
[36:34] &gt;&gt; uh before the minister in the word,
[36:35] maybe we'll just allow a an opportunity
[36:38] to start forming an expectation [music]
[36:39] in your heart and maybe a need that you
[36:42] have in your life for yourself or for a
[36:44] family member, a brother, sister, maybe
[36:47] somebody in the church.
[36:50] I believe God can meet that need and I
[36:52] believe the Holy Spirit can just come in
[36:53] a supernatural way [music] and that the
[36:55] word can come forth and faith can rise
[36:57] up and bring forth the manifestation of
[37:00] the promise. Maybe as we just have the
[37:04] musicians, why don't we just go before
[37:05] the Lord in prayer? Lord Jesus,
[37:09] Lord, we're thankful that we could be
[37:10] here
[37:12] this evening. Lord, it's all that it's
[37:14] all by your grace and your mercy that
[37:17] Lord, you've called us and you've
[37:18] elected us. Lord, you've called us out
[37:21] from the things of the world and to this
[37:24] great glorious truth that we've received
[37:27] in this [music] last day.
[37:30] Lord, we just pray that this meeting
[37:32] here tonight, Lord, you'd just come.
[37:33] [music] And Lord, we have some
[37:36] scriptures and some quotes that are put
[37:38] down.
[37:41] But Lord, if you don't come by, then
[37:44] what would be the benefit?
[37:46] So Lord, I [music] just ask that you
[37:47] would come and you'd break the bread of
[37:49] life. And Lord, you distribute it to the
[37:52] needs that are represented here. And
[37:54] Lord, may in our heart we just start to
[37:55] form an expectation. Lord, may Lord, may
[37:59] there be ones that are in bondage set
[38:00] [music] free. And Lord, may where ones
[38:03] that need the revelation, Lord, may
[38:05] revelation break forth. And those that
[38:08] need to be born again and filled with
[38:10] the Holy Spirit. Oh God, may your mercy
[38:12] and your grace just go to each one,
[38:15] Lord, as only you can. Lord, we just
[38:17] surrender ourselves to you that you
[38:19] could just come just have your perfect
[38:21] will and way in the service now. In your
[38:23] name, the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray.
[38:26] Amen. Praise the Lord. If you have your
[38:28] Bibles, we'll be reading out of numbers.
[38:31] I just want to thank brother Donnie and
[38:32] brother Joe for the invitation to be
[38:34] able to come and to be in fellowship
[38:37] with you. It's uh certainly a great
[38:40] privilege and opportunity. We don't take
[38:42] it take it lightly. My name's Brother
[38:44] Matthew McGary and I'm from Bedford,
[38:47] Texas. My dad, brother David McGary, is
[38:49] the pastor there at Christian Life
[38:51] Tabernacle. So, we bring your greetings
[38:53] and we're just excited for what the Lord
[38:55] would have.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; And don't be afraid to talk back. I'm
[39:00] going to be preaching at you. So, don't
[39:01] don't be afraid to let me know that
[39:03] you're here. But, um, we just have maybe
[39:05] a little something on our heart. Don't
[39:07] know what the direction we might go, but
[39:09] just want it to be a benefit to you. Is
[39:11] everybody feeling good this evening?
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm sure some of you have tired.
[39:15] Maybe you you drove a little bit away,
[39:16] maybe not, but we'll just move right
[39:18] into the word just to appreciate this.
[39:21] Numbers chapter 13 and verse 23- 27
[39:26] says, "And they came under the brook of
[39:27] Eshkll and cut down from then a branch
[39:31] with one cluster of grapes, and they
[39:33] bare it between two upon a staff, and
[39:36] they brought up the pomegranates and the
[39:38] figs, the and the place was called the
[39:41] brook of Eshkll, because of the clusters
[39:43] of grapes which the children of Israel
[39:45] cut down from thins. And they returned
[39:47] from searching of the land for 40 days.
[39:49] And they went and came to Moses and to
[39:51] Aaron and to all the congregation of the
[39:53] children of Israel, unto the wilderness
[39:55] of Piran and Kadesh, and brought back
[39:57] word unto them, and unto all the
[39:59] congregation, and showed them the fruit
[40:02] of the land. And they told them And they
[40:05] told him, and said, We came unto the
[40:06] land whether thou sentest us, and surely
[40:09] it flowth with milk and honey, and this
[40:13] is the fruit of it. And also if you just
[40:16] turn in your Bibles to Galatians chapter
[40:18] 3
[40:30] just reading here out of Galatians
[40:31] chapter 3 and verse 29
[40:35] it says and if you be Christ
[40:38] then are ye Abraham's seed and hes
[40:42] according to the promise. Amen. You may
[40:45] be seated.
[40:47] If you be Christ, then ye are Abraham's
[40:50] seed and hes according to the promise.
[40:53] And I was just listening to a sermon
[40:55] Brother Brandon preached. It's called
[40:57] the conflict between God and Satan.
[41:01] And he says, "And the other night I was
[41:03] preaching. I believe it was the
[41:05] tabernacle. And I struck something
[41:06] that's done me more good than anything
[41:09] I've thought of since I've been
[41:11] converted." And I might repeat it again
[41:14] if it's all right. I know where you know
[41:16] where I'm going to. But it was that
[41:19] evidence of salvation. And I thought, my
[41:22] if here's the prophet preaching in 1962
[41:25] and he says he struck a thought uh that
[41:27] that did him done him more good than
[41:29] than his conversion. I thought my I want
[41:31] to know a little bit about that, too.
[41:33] I'd like to look into this and see maybe
[41:35] maybe what he was talking about. And he
[41:37] starts to to to to show this how it was
[41:40] on the evidence of salvation. You know,
[41:42] as I thought about that, I I just
[41:44] thought I would ask, you know, what does
[41:45] salvation mean to you?
[41:48] &gt;&gt; You know, what is even the word
[41:50] salvation when when it when it's said,
[41:51] what does it mean to you? You know, h
[41:53] have you experienced it? you know, and
[41:55] and that's just kind of the way life is,
[41:57] you know, is is maybe uh there might be
[42:00] certain places if you drive around town
[42:02] and you go to certain places and and
[42:04] they might not mean anything to you, but
[42:06] somebody else they might have had an
[42:07] experience there or maybe uh they were
[42:09] proposed to or or something would have
[42:11] happened and maybe there's certain
[42:13] church grounds or certain camps and
[42:15] where you where you met the Lord and and
[42:16] or maybe there's a certain place that
[42:18] becomes really special to you because it
[42:21] has meaning and it it has it has some
[42:23] value to you and So when you when you
[42:26] hear it, you know, you maybe you perk up
[42:27] or you you know, you recognize it like,
[42:29] "Oh, I know a little bit about that."
[42:31] You know, that's how it is with certain
[42:32] hobbies and things, you know, uh you can
[42:34] start talking about hunting and and and
[42:37] you know, there's some people who go
[42:38] hunting and there's some people who are
[42:39] hunters and and you can just get to
[42:41] talking a little bit and somebody can
[42:43] say, "Well, I I bought a gun and I go
[42:44] out in the woods and and that's about as
[42:46] far as they can talk about hunting." And
[42:48] then you talk to some other people who
[42:49] my they can just start talking in such a
[42:52] way that it's Greek to you, you know,
[42:53] like I don't even know what you're
[42:54] talking about. I I just I I get a gun
[42:57] and I go out and make a loud noise and
[42:58] and I never shoot anything. Well, maybe
[43:00] that's cuz you're not a hunter. But, you
[43:02] know, that's just the way it is. You
[43:03] could even think about maybe dates and I
[43:05] I was thinking about that, you know, is,
[43:07] you know, October 20th. I mean, does
[43:09] [clears throat] does that mean anything
[43:10] to anybody? October 20th, you know, does
[43:13] somebody in here? Maybe maybe 200
[43:15] October 20th, 2007. YOU CAN START
[43:17] TALKING ABOUT CERTAIN DATES AND AND THAT
[43:19] MIGHT mean something to you cuz maybe
[43:20] it's your birthday or maybe somebody was
[43:22] born on that day and and and so your
[43:24] ears will perk up and and and you you
[43:26] know it might it might cause an
[43:28] expression and you know I was thinking
[43:29] about that and the other day I was on
[43:31] the phone and I I I was talking and I
[43:33] said I'll be there in six seven minutes
[43:34] and and all a sudden my kids you know
[43:36] they just I'm like what what did I say?
[43:37] What did I say? And it's it's just
[43:39] amazing now that there's some you can
[43:40] just say a couple NUMBERS AND PEOPLE
[43:42] LIKE WOW WOW YOU KNOW my because because
[43:44] it's some type of thing that that people
[43:47] are their ears are perked up to and and
[43:49] and it causes some type of REACTION AND
[43:51] AND I wonder though when WE WAS WHEN WE
[43:53] TALK ABOUT SALVATION
[43:55] &gt;&gt; WOULD would you perk UP? WOULD IF
[43:57] SOMEBODY SAID SALVATION or the message
[43:59] of the HOUR WOULD WOULD ALL A SUDDEN YOU
[44:00] SAY HEY WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? I
[44:02] WANT TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT
[44:03] THAT. But but but but MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
[44:06] WE WE DON'T HAVE THE VALUE THAT it
[44:07] should have and and maybe it doesn't
[44:09] have the meaning that it should have.
[44:10] And and HERE THE PROPHET IS TALKING
[44:12] ABOUT THE EVIDENCE OF SALVATION. And and
[44:14] I say it ought to mean something to you.
[44:16] I I I say, "What about the grace and the
[44:18] mercy of God?" AND WHAT ABOUT SALVATION?
[44:22] &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "I I THINK THAT
[44:25] SALVATION is the greatest miracle." G.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; And that's what I'd want to by the help
[44:30] of God just talk to you a little bit
[44:32] this evening is the evidence of
[44:35] salvation.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; He goes on in this message. He says, "It
[44:39] struck me and I and I and I I said I
[44:42] went home and I got in my room and I I I
[44:44] walked up and down the floor and I I
[44:46] just had a little good old time by
[44:47] myself, you know, just in there thinking
[44:49] about it." You know, we could preach a
[44:52] little bit right there for a little bit.
[44:53] Has has the preacher ever been preaching
[44:56] or have you ever been read reading your
[44:58] Bible or have you ever been listening to
[45:00] the message and the word struck you in
[45:02] such a way that you got excited about
[45:04] it?
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Now look, I'm not here to condemn. I I'm
[45:08] here to encourage you. If that has not
[45:10] happened in your life, I just want to
[45:12] say you're missing out. You you can read
[45:14] about who won the World Series and who
[45:16] won the Super Bowl and you can read the
[45:18] news and you can study this career and
[45:20] you can study that and I tell YOU ALL
[45:22] THOSE THINGS are going to burn. They're
[45:24] they're they're going to just be BURNING
[45:27] ATOMIC FIRE. BUT I want to tell you
[45:28] there's one thing that won't pass away
[45:30] and that is the WORD OF GOD. AND I WANT
[45:32] TO SAY IF THERE'S ANYTHING WORTH GETTING
[45:33] EXCITED ABOUT, I WANT TO SAY IT'S about
[45:35] the grace OF GOD. IF THERE'S ANYTHING
[45:37] WORTH TALKING ABOUT, IT'S ABOUT
[45:39] SALVATION. IF THERE'S ANYTHING WORTH
[45:40] TALKING ABOUT, IT'S THE MESSAGE OF THE
[45:42] HOUR. AND I SAY, "OH, GOD, HELP ME THAT
[45:44] SOMETHING IN THE WORD OF GOD WOULD
[45:46] STRIKE MY HEART IN SUCH A WAY THAT I
[45:48] COULD GO HOME AND I WOULD PACE BACK UP
[45:49] INTO THE FLOOR SAY,"LORD, I WANT TO KNOW
[45:51] A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT. I HEARD MY
[45:53] PASTOR PREACHING ON THE SUBJECT AND AND
[45:55] MAYBE I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND IT ALL,
[45:56] LORD, BUT SOMETHING IN MY SOUL WANTS TO
[45:58] KNOW MORE. I WANT TO HAVE SOME MORE
[46:00] REVELATION, LORD. I I WANT TO KNOW MORE
[46:02] ABOUT YOUR GRACE AND YOUR MERCY, LORD. I
[46:04] I WANT TO UNDERSTAND YOUR WORD MORE." I
[46:06] SAY SOMETHING OUGHT TO STIR OUR HEARTS.
[46:08] SOMETHING OUGHT TO MAKE US SAY, "I WANT
[46:09] TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT."
[46:11] BUT IT'S SO EASY TO GET STIRRED UP WITH
[46:13] THE THINGS OF THE WORLD.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; So easy to get STIRRED UP WITH OUR JOBS
[46:17] AND WHAT FRIENDS THINK AND WHAT PEOPLE
[46:19] SAY.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; But just to think here he is. He's he
[46:23] HE'S WALKING UP AND PACING BACK AND
[46:25] FORTH on the floor and and here's what
[46:27] it was. I MIGHT PASS THIS ON to you for
[46:28] just a minute. I was talking about we
[46:31] are possessors of all things.
[46:34] Everything is ours.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Well, hallelujah.
[46:40] Glory to God. That ought to be enough
[46:42] right there to make somebody shout to
[46:44] think that if we are heirs of Christ,
[46:47] then we are heirs to all things. LOOK,
[46:49] YOU YOU YOU MIGHT NOT EVER BE ABLE TO GO
[46:51] TO ITALY ON THIS SIDE. YOU MIGHT NOT BE
[46:53] ABLE TO EVER GO OVER HERE, BUT I WANT TO
[46:54] TELL YOU, YOU OWN IT. IT'S YOURS. YOU
[46:56] MIGHT DRIVE DOWN. I TELL YOU WHAT, THIS
[46:58] IS MY FIRST TIME TO TO JOHNSON CITY.

[47:07] THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO BE. JUST JUST
[47:09] BEAUTIFUL. AND YOU MIGHT DRIVE AROUND.
[47:11] YOU MIGHT SEE BIG HOMES UP ON THE HILLS.

[47:16] HILL AND IT WAS ALL MOWED AND ALL THE
[47:17] TREES ARE BEAUTIFUL AND THE COWS WERE
[47:19] EVERYTHING. MAN, MY THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL
[47:20] PLACE. WOULDN'T IT BE SOMETHING TO LIVE
[47:21] UP THERE? BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S MINE.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; I own it.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, BROTHER?
[47:28] BECAUSE I'M HEIR TO EVERYTHING. YOU SEE,
[47:30] SO MANY TIMES WE WE JUST GET SO CAUGHT
[47:32] UP WITH THE NATURAL THINGS AND THE RAT
[47:34] run uh the RAT RACE OF SOCIETY. WE GET
[47:37] SO BOGGED DOWN AND WE FORGET THE
[47:38] BENEFITS AND THE BLESSINGS THAT WERE
[47:40] BENEFICIARIES OF HIS RESURRECTION.
[47:43] [applause]
[47:45] &gt;&gt; WE POSSESS ALL THINGS. AND THE PROPHET
[47:47] WOULD GO ON AND SAY THAT'S WHY THEY CALL
[47:48] US CRAZY, you know, and and and because
[47:51] we we act funny. WHY? BECAUSE WE POSSESS
[47:53] ALL THINGS. WE POSSESS love and joy and
[47:57] peace. I DON'T KNOW. DOES ANYBODY NEED
[47:59] SOME JOY TONIGHT? DOES ANYBODY NEED SOME
[48:02] PEACE? WELL, YOU CAN'T GO DOWN TO
[48:04] WALMART and and go out to the clerk
[48:06] THERE AND SAY, "HEY, I I JUST WANT TO
[48:08] ASK YOU. I I JUST COME DOWN HERE. I'VE
[48:09] GONE UP ALL AND DOWN THE AISLES AND I
[48:11] WAS TRYING TO FIND ME SOME JOY." They
[48:14] would, "Excuse me, what are YOU WHAT ARE
[48:15] YOU TALKING? I NEED SOME JOY." YOU KNOW,
[48:17] LIKE THE JOY OF YOUR SALVATION. THEY
[48:19] WOULD LOOK AT YOU FUNNY.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, ACTUALLY, I'M HERE TO
[48:23] BUY SOME LOVE OR I'M HERE TO BUY SOME
[48:25] PEACE." YOU CAN'T GO DOWN TO THE GROCERY
[48:27] STORE. YOU CAN'T GO TO THE PHARMACY AND
[48:29] YOU CAN'T BUY TELL YOU WHAT, THE DEVIL
[48:30] GOTS A LOT OF SUBSTITUTES. And I want TO
[48:32] TELL YOU, IF YOU GOT INTO SOME TYPE OF
[48:34] ADDICTION AND YOU GOT SOME TYPE OF
[48:36] MEDICINE THE DOCTORS PRESCRIBED TO YOU,
[48:37] WELL, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. BUT I WOULD TELL
[48:39] YOU, WHY DON'T YOU PRAY FOR A
[48:40] REVELATION? AND I TELL YOU, THE WORD CAN
[48:42] COME IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU CAN THROW
[48:44] THAT MEDICINE AWAY AND SAY, "I AIN'T GOT
[48:47] TO GO DOWN TO THE PHARMACY ANYMORE FOR
[48:49] MY HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, FOR MY
[48:50] DEPRESSION, WHATEVER IT IS." WHY?
[48:52] BECAUSE I'M HEIR TO ALL THINGS. I own
[48:55] joy. I own peace. I OWN LONGSUFFERING.
[48:58] I'M A CHILD OF THE KING. AND IT'S ALL
[49:00] MINE.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[49:05] &gt;&gt; SEE, all of those things ARE ALL ALREADY
[49:07] OURS. YOU YOU CAN'T GO DOWN TO THE STORE
[49:10] and buy it, but God gives us that.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; We possess it. That's our possession.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, I like that. And and we're JUST
[49:18] FOLLOWING A LITTLE THOUGHT HERE. OUR
[49:19] BROTHER BRANDHAM, HE'S IN THIS MESSAGE,
[49:21] THE CONFLICT between God and Satan. And
[49:23] and I believe he's referencing uh what
[49:25] he preaches earlier that month at the
[49:27] tabernacle uh possessing all things. And
[49:29] he says, "YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING ABOUT
[49:31] OUR INHERITANCE." And and he got to
[49:33] thinking about Israel and how they were
[49:35] in bondage. And here Israel's in bondage
[49:37] for 400 years. And and and my I can't
[49:41] you can't even imagine uh those task
[49:43] masters and and how they beat them. And
[49:45] and my they they they maybe killed you
[49:47] if you if you weren't working the way
[49:49] they wanted and they kill your children
[49:50] or take your daughters. And here they're
[49:52] THEY'VE BEEN IN BONDAGE FOR 400 YEARS.
[49:55] AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, HERE COMES A
[49:56] PROPHET COMING OUT OF THE WILDERNESS AND
[49:57] HE'S TELLING THEM, "HEY, HEY, HEY, I GOD
[50:00] GIVE A PROMISE AND WE'RE GOING TO A
[50:01] PROMISED LAND. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE IN
[50:03] BONDAGE ANYMORE."
[50:05] &gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT IT. HERE HE COME OUT OF
[50:06] THERE AND HE'S TELLING THEM, "LOOK, YOU
[50:07] DON'T HAVE TO YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE IN
[50:08] THE MUD PITS ANYMORE AND AND YOU DON'T
[50:10] HAVE TO HAVE THESE TAX MASTERS ANYMORE
[50:12] CUZ THE TIME HAS COME THAT THAT GOD IS
[50:14] GOING TO TAKE YOU OUT OF THIS BONDAGE."
[50:16] WELL, I DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN
[50:18] FIND THAT AND LOOK INTO THE BIBLE. BUT
[50:19] SOMETIMES WE NEED TO UPDATE THE BIBLE
[50:21] EXPERIENCES INTO OUR OWN LIFE AND START
[50:23] TO LOOK, YOU KNOW, MAYBE I'VE HAD A
[50:24] TASKMASTER. MAYBE SOMETHING'S BEEN
[50:26] RULING AND REIGNING OVER MY LIFE AND AND
[50:28] MAYBE I'VE BEEN DOING THINGS THAT I
[50:30] DON'T WANT TO DO AND AND I COME TO
[50:31] CHURCH AND I GO TO CAMP AND I HAVE AN
[50:33] EXPERIENCE AND THEN I GO BACK AWAY AND I
[50:35] FALL TO THE SAME MISTAKES OVER AND OVER
[50:37] AND OVER. WELL, I WANT TO TELL YOU,
[50:39] SOMETIMES WE MAKE MISTAKES AND SOMETIMES
[50:40] WE FALL. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU, IF
[50:42] YOU'RE IN BONDAGE TO THAT THING AND IT'S
[50:44] RULING AND REIGNING IN YOUR LIFE AND YOU
[50:46] HAVE NO CONTROL OVER YOUR BODY AND OVER
[50:48] YOUR VESSEL, LOOK, WE ARE TO POSSESS OUR
[50:50] VESSELS AND SANCTIFICATION AND HONOR.
[50:52] AND I WANT TO TELL YOU, THERE'S ONLY ONE
[50:54] WAY THAT YOU CAN DO THAT, AND THAT'S BY
[50:55] THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. AND IF
[50:57] YOU ARE A CHILD OF GOD, YOU DO NOT HAVE
[50:59] TO LIVE IN BONDAGE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO
[51:01] BOW TO THAT LUST DEVIL. YOU DON'T HAVE
[51:03] TO BOW TO THOSE SPIRITS. YOU CAN BE SET
[51:05] FREE AND FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND
[51:07] SHOUT THE VICTORY.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[51:14] &gt;&gt; OH, AND HERE'S THE MESSAGE COMING FORTH.
[51:16] LOOK, YOU DON'T YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO
[51:18] LIVE THAT WAY ANYMORE. The prophet of
[51:20] God would say this. He says uh but now
[51:23] they they they're told they're COMING
[51:25] OUT OF THIS BONDAGE AND AND AND THEY'RE
[51:27] GOING UH THEY'RE going to a land that
[51:30] flowth with milk and honey, and they can
[51:32] have their own farm. they they can raise
[51:35] their OWN STUFF AND AND feed their own
[51:37] children and send them to school and
[51:39] live in peace and and this GREAT LAND
[51:40] THAT BELONGS TO THEM, YOU KNOW, TO TO
[51:43] THEM. WHAT WHAT A GREAT PROMISE. THINK
[51:45] OF WHAT THAT MEANT.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; WELL, once again, why don't we bring it
[51:51] up to our day?
[51:55] &gt;&gt; God's Hey, God's given us great and
[51:57] precious promises
[51:59] &gt;&gt; that by these we might be partakers of
[52:01] divine nature. A and if we're not
[52:04] careful, WE SELL OURSELVES SHORT OF WHAT
[52:06] CHRIST DIED FOR. THAT THE VERY LIFE OF
[52:08] JESUS CHRIST COULD COME BACK AND IN
[52:10] TABERNACLE YOUR BODY.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; LOOK, I I have it right here. I I I
[52:16] GUESS THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT IT OUT. THE
[52:17] PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "AND AS THE FATHER
[52:18] HAS SENT ME, SO SEND YOU." JESUS SEE.
[52:21] NOW WATCH. THE FATHER THAT SENT HIM went
[52:24] in him to vindicate himself. Right? For
[52:27] he was THE WORD. AND THE SAME JESUS THAT
[52:29] SENT YOU GOES WITH you and in you TO
[52:32] VINDICATE THE SAME GOD. AS THE FATHER
[52:34] HAS SENT ME, I live by the father, so I
[52:36] send you AND YOU LIVE BY ME. WHAT IS HE?
[52:39] HE IS THE WORD AND YOU LIVE BY THE WORD.
[52:42] LOOK, THE THE GOD DID NOT SEND A MESSAGE
[52:44] BY A VINDICATED PROPHET. SO IT WOULD BE
[52:47] SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD NEVER OBTAIN
[52:48] AND IT'S JUST SOME MESSAGE AND SOME
[52:50] GREAT PROPHET AND HE DID THE GREATER
[52:52] WORKS AND YOU CAN NEVER SPEAK TO THE
[52:54] MOUNTAIN AND YOU CAN NEVER GET THE TOTAL
[52:56] VICTORY AND YOU CAN NEVER COME TO THESE
[52:58] PLACES AND YOU'RE ALWAYS JUST TRYING AND
[53:00] YOU'RE ALWAYS FALLING SHORT AND AND
[53:02] YOU'RE ALWAYS JUST HOPING AND AND YOU'RE
[53:03] LOOKING AT EVERYBODY ELSE AND WHY ARE
[53:05] THEY SO GOOD AND WHY ARE THEY SUCH A
[53:07] GOOD CHRISTIAN AND WHY I'M ALWAYS HAVING
[53:09] PROBLEMS. LOOK, THIS MESSAGE CAME TO LET
[53:11] YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE HEIR TO
[53:13] EVERYTHING. AND JUST AS THE PROPHET OF
[53:15] GOD WAS ABLE TO LIVE A OVERCOMING,
[53:16] VICTORIOUS LIFE. LOOK, I BELIEVE THAT
[53:18] WAS THE FIRST ONE TO MATURITY, SHOWING
[53:20] US THIS MESSAGE WORKS.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; HEY, THIS MESSAGE WORKS. I TELL YOU
[53:24] WHAT, IF YOU EVER COME INTO THE PRESENCE
[53:26] OF ALMIGHTY GOD AND YOU CONFESS YOUR
[53:28] SINS AND SAY, "LORD, I AM SORRY. PLEASE
[53:30] FORGIVE ME." I TELL YOU, THERE'S A
[53:32] GUSHER FROM HEAVEN THAT'LL COME DOWN.
[53:34] IT'LL CHANGE THE WAY YOU ACT. IT'LL
[53:36] CHANGE THE WAY YOU THINK. IT WILL CHANGE
[53:37] YOUR NATURE. IT WILL FILL YOU WITH THE
[53:39] HOLY GHOST. AND THEREFORE, IT'S NO MORE
[53:41] I THAT LIVETH. IT IS CHRIST THAT LIVETH
[53:43] IN ME. AND THE VERY CHRIST ANOINTING IN
[53:45] MY LIFE IS FULFILLING THE VERY SPOKEN
[53:48] WORD OF THE HOUR. IT AIN'T SOMETHING
[53:50] THAT A MAN CAN DO. IT AIN'T SOMETHING
[53:51] THAT I CAN THINK OF OR SOMETHING THAT I
[53:53] CAN MUSTER. LOOK, IT GOT TO BE SOMETHING
[53:55] THAT YOU SURRENDER TO.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Today is the day of salvation.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; What about it, young people?
[54:08] Hey, tonight's a new night.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; YESTERDAY'S GONE AND THE OTHER CAMPS,
[54:13] THEY'RE ALL GONE. BUT TONIGHT'S A NEW
[54:15] NIGHT.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; TODAY IS THE SALVATION of the Lord.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; I say like THEM LEPERS SAY, "WHY SIT YE
[54:22] HERE UNTIL YOU DIE?"
[54:24] &gt;&gt; You got a need. You got something YOU
[54:26] HAVE NEED OF. LOOK, UH UH GET GET RID OF
[54:28] YOUR PRIDE. DON'T WORRY ABOUT YOUR
[54:30] NEIGHBOR. THERE IS SOMETHING here for
[54:31] you.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; THERE'S MORE HOLY GHOST. THERE'S MORE
[54:36] LIBERTY. THERE'S MORE FREEDOM. THERE'S
[54:37] MORE REVELATION.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; WELL, all right.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; So, we're just in THIS STORY HERE HOW HE
[54:44] BRINGS THEM THIS GREAT PROMISE and what
[54:47] that must have meant to them. And then
[54:48] we KNOW HOW GOD BROUGHT THEM OUT BY A
[54:50] MIGHTY HAND WITH ALL THE PLAGUES and and
[54:52] THEN THEY WERE BACKED UP THERE AT AT THE
[54:54] RED SEA AND and my we just we just moved
[54:57] through so MANY THINGS THAT YOU COULD
[54:58] TAP INTO THERE. BUT GOD BRINGS THEM OUT
[55:01] AND I WANT TO GET DOWN TO WHERE OUR TEXT
[55:02] WAS AND WHERE WHERE NOW BROTHER
[55:04] BRANDHAM'S referring to Joshua AND CALEB
[55:06] AND THE SPIES GOING OVER. HE SAYS, "AND
[55:08] JOSHUA WENT OVER INTO THE promised
[55:10] land." Now remember, none of them had
[55:12] ever been there. They didn't know
[55:15] whether the land was actually there or
[55:16] not. They just by faith went by what was
[55:20] told them that God had a place for them
[55:22] and they was going to that place just by
[55:25] faith. Now think of that. left Egypt and
[55:28] God brought them out and now they're
[55:30] nearing that land. And when they get
[55:32] near the land, Joshua goes over into the
[55:35] land and brings back the evidence.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; CROSSES JORDAN, GOES OVER INTO
[55:42] PALESTINE, BRINGS BACK THE EVIDENCE. A
[55:45] GREAT BUNCH OF GRAPES THAT TAKEN TWO MEN
[55:49] TO PACK AND THEY could eat those grapes.
[55:52] And he said, "THE LAND IS JUST EXACTLY
[55:56] what God said it was."
[55:58] &gt;&gt; SO HERE'S JOSHUA AND CALEB. THEY'RE
[56:00] COMING BACK WITH THE FRUIT. THEY'RE
[56:01] COMING BACK WITH THE EVIDENCE. THEY
[56:03] ACTUALLY have proof.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; You're like, "Well, brother, yeah. What
[56:08] so what do you what does that even mean,
[56:10] brother Matthew?" You know, I was kind
[56:12] of thinking about that. You know,
[56:13] sometimes I'll take my kids to an ice
[56:15] cream shop. You know, you go in there
[56:17] and they got all the flavors and
[56:18] everything like that. Little Evan, you
[56:20] know, six years old, he I want that one.
[56:23] Okay. You want the mocha frappuccino
[56:27] chocolate chip chunk special? Yeah, I
[56:31] want that one. Like, all right. Can Can
[56:33] we get a sample of that? And we get a
[56:35] little sample, right? And I give it to
[56:38] him.
[56:40] And he puts that and he tastes he goes,
[56:41] "Yeah,
[56:44] I want that one." I say, "Okay, son. You
[56:47] can have that one." You know what? what
[56:48] he starts doing. He starts jumping. HE
[56:51] STARTS GETTING EXCITED. HE STARTS
[56:53] TELLING HIS SISTERS.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; He He ain't worried about how much it
[56:58] cost.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; He He ain't worried of how long it took
[57:02] to make it.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; He He HE HE DON'T CARE BECAUSE HIS
[57:05] DADDY, his father said, "Son, you can
[57:08] have it."
[57:09] &gt;&gt; AND NOW ALL HE'S ACTUALLY DONE IS HE'S
[57:11] JUST TASTED A LITTLE SPOONFUL.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HE STARTS DOING? JUST
[57:16] HEAD. I I'M GOING TO GET ME SOME ICE
[57:18] CREAM. MY THAT WAS REALLY GOOD. I WANT
[57:20] TO TELL YOU WHY DOES HE GET SO EXCITED?
[57:22] CUZ HE KNOWS THERE'S MORE WHERE THAT
[57:23] CAME FROM.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; WELL, COME ON, CHILDREN OF GOD. I DON'T
[57:27] KNOW WHAT TYPE OF EXPERIENCE. I don't
[57:29] know WHAT KIND OF BLESSING, BUT I KNOW
[57:30] THAT JESUS CHRIST IS HERE AND YOU CAN
[57:32] HAVE AN EXPERIENCE. AND I JUST WANT TO
[57:34] TELL YOU, IT'S JUST A LITTLE TASTE. IT'S
[57:36] JUST A LITTLE DOWN PAYMENT. COME ON. AND
[57:38] IF HEY, IF IF WE CAN GET EXCITED ABOUT
[57:41] ICE CREAM, HOW MUCH MORE CAN WE GET
[57:43] EXCITED ABOUT THE GRACE AND THE MERCY OF
[57:45] GOD? IF YOU'VE EVER COME INTO HIS
[57:46] PRESENCE, IF YOU'VE EVER EXPERIENCED THE
[57:49] GRACE OF GOD COMING INTO THE CHURCH AND
[57:51] WALKING UP AND DOWN THE AISLES AND IF
[57:53] YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED HIS BLESSING, OH,
[57:55] THERE OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING THAT RAISES
[57:56] UP ON THE ON THE INSIDE OF YOU SAYS,
[57:57] "HEY, THERE'S MORE WHERE THAT CAME
[58:00] FROM." I SERVE A A GOD THAT OWNS A
[58:02] CATTLE ON A THOUSAND EELS AND I'VE JUST
[58:05] GOT A LITTLE BITTY TASTE, BUT I WANT TO
[58:06] TELL YOU THERE'S MORE WHERE THAT CAME
[58:08] FROM.
[58:11] OH,
[58:12] &gt;&gt; he he got the evidence.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; You know, he when he tasted that, it was
[58:18] evidence. SEE, YOU YOU CAN TRY to look
[58:20] at something and just just think, well,
[58:22] yeah, it it looks good. But my Bible
[58:26] says, "Oh, taste and see that the Lord
[58:28] is good."
[58:29] &gt;&gt; You know, so when you when you look at
[58:31] those things and and here in our text is
[58:33] where we're at. He says, "AND WE CAME
[58:34] UNDER THE LAND WHETHER WHETHER thou
[58:36] sentest us, and surely it flowth with
[58:38] milk and honey, and this is the fruit of
[58:41] it." You know, I don't know about you,
[58:42] but I remember maybe as a kid thinking
[58:44] about that. I'm like, a land flowing
[58:47] with milk and honey?
[58:50] Like, does it have like rivers of milk
[58:53] &gt;&gt; and are like the trees dripping like
[58:55] with honey?
[58:57] You know, and I I'm like, what what does
[58:59] that even mean? And and I was thinking
[59:01] about that and I thought, you know what?
[59:03] Because when you hear something in the
[59:05] word of God or you hear something in
[59:06] that, what do you start to do? You try
[59:08] to make a mental image or you try to
[59:11] interpret the word
[59:14] &gt;&gt; a land that maybe there's a lot of cows
[59:16] and bees
[59:19] &gt;&gt; because you're trying to understand or
[59:22] interpret, you know, you start to THINK
[59:24] ABOUT AND I AND I I I GOT TO THINK ABOUT
[59:26] THAT. AND I said, "You know, there's
[59:27] this thing called now chat, GPT,
[59:29] whatever."
[59:30] &gt;&gt; And and I and I put in the description,
[59:32] and sure enough, it painted a beautiful
[59:34] picture with some big old mountains. And
[59:37] here come right out of one mountain, a
[59:39] big river of milk. And here come out of
[59:42] the other mountain, a big river of
[59:43] honey.
[59:47] Because what was it? It was it was an
[59:49] intellectual conception of what the word
[59:52] promise meant. And I want to tell you,
[59:54] IF WE ARE NOT CAREFUL, we start to
[59:56] accept an explanation. We start to
[59:59] expect accept an idea or we read
[1:00:01] something there and there and if we're
[1:00:03] not careful, we accept some definition
[1:00:05] as the revelation and we never actually
[1:00:07] experience the true promise or the
[1:00:09] benefit of it.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Look, we live in an age where everything
[1:00:13] can be altered and everything can be
[1:00:15] edited and and I mean now they making
[1:00:18] things, you know, pictures you don't
[1:00:20] even know if it's real or not. Yeah.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; You say, "Look at this, man. Isn't this
[1:00:24] No, no, no. That's AI."
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; You know, I I was I was up in Montana
[1:00:28] and and uh you know, we were just
[1:00:31] blessed to be coming around this this
[1:00:32] bin. I was able to take this shot just
[1:00:34] perfect cuz there's this big uh uh uh uh
[1:00:37] ram just with the horns and everything.
[1:00:39] And and the way I was able to take the
[1:00:41] picture, I mean, it should be long in a
[1:00:42] magazine. I showed it to people like
[1:00:43] that. You Oh, that's AI. You didn't take
[1:00:45] that. And I'm like, "Well, actually, I
[1:00:47] I'll show you the video." And it just so
[1:00:48] happened this thing wandered right into
[1:00:50] a guest parking area and and I didn't
[1:00:52] have to go and do anything. I just
[1:00:53] pulled up the car and got out and took
[1:00:55] the picture. But some people didn't even
[1:00:56] believe me like, "Oh, that that's AI.
[1:00:58] It's fabricated." I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU
[1:00:59] GOT TO BE CAREFUL THE THINGS THAT YOU
[1:01:01] FEED on and the things you look at and
[1:01:02] and the things that you start thinking
[1:01:04] that's true and that's obtainable. And
[1:01:05] you know, I was just here. It just
[1:01:07] reminds me. I was just here at a coffee
[1:01:08] shop uh uh uh yesterday and and there
[1:01:11] was this young man in the shop and I got
[1:01:12] to talking to him a little bit and about
[1:01:14] the Lord and he was a a young Christian
[1:01:16] and he he was actually going to be doing
[1:01:18] a podcast. He was going to be doing a
[1:01:20] podcast on on uh uh uh comparing
[1:01:22] yourself and and and you know and I just
[1:01:25] got to think just talking to him a
[1:01:26] little bit about that, you know, and and
[1:01:28] and how uh uh he was just talking about
[1:01:31] how you get online and and you get on
[1:01:33] these these social medias and everything
[1:01:35] like that and it it's all fake. It's all
[1:01:37] edited AND IT'S JUST THE HIGHLIGHTS of
[1:01:40] people's LIFE AND IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL,
[1:01:41] YOU GET ON THERE AND YOU START FEEDING
[1:01:43] on that stuff, it's an unrealistic
[1:01:45] expectation of things that you can never
[1:01:47] obtain.
[1:01:49] And then you get on THERE AND ALL A
[1:01:50] SUDDEN YOU GET A SPIRIT OF LUST ON YOU
[1:01:52] BECAUSE you're lusting after all these
[1:01:54] things that are they're fake and edited.
[1:01:56] And I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU, LOOK,
[1:01:57] EVERYTHING THE DEVIL HAS TO offer is
[1:01:59] fake. LOOK, I'VE BEEN OUT there in the
[1:02:01] world and I've ran after the things of
[1:02:02] the world. AND I WAS OUT THERE IN THE
[1:02:04] WORLD FOR A LONG TIME. AND AND I WANT TO
[1:02:06] TELL YOU, EVERYTHING THAT THE DEVIL HAD
[1:02:08] TO OFFER ME WAS JUST A FAKE. IT WAS JUST
[1:02:10] A BOGUS. THERE WAS NO LIFE. IT WAS JUST
[1:02:12] DEATH. THERE WAS NO DRUGS. THERE WAS NO
[1:02:14] ALCOHOL. THERE WAS NOTHING OUT THERE
[1:02:16] THAT COULD EVER FILL UH THAT VOID AND
[1:02:18] THAT HUNGER ON THE INSIDE OF ME. I WAS
[1:02:20] LOOKING FOR SOMETHING REAL. AND I WANT
[1:02:22] TO TELL YOU YOUNG PEOPLE, WHAT YOU'RE
[1:02:23] LOOKING FOR, IT AIN'T OUT IN THE WORLD.
[1:02:24] IT AIN'T ON SOME WEBSITE. IT AIN'T SOME
[1:02:26] BOY. IT AIN'T SOME GIRL. IT AIN'T SOME
[1:02:28] CAREER. IT AIN'T SOME JOB. IT AIN'T SOME
[1:02:30] BIG HOUSE. THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
[1:02:32] THAT'LL EVER FILL THAT VOID INSIDE OF
[1:02:34] YOUR HEART. THAT'S THE REVELATION OF
[1:02:36] JESUS CHRIST TO YOU PERSONALLY. THAT
[1:02:38] THIS MESSAGE IS THE ONLY SALVATION IN
[1:02:41] THE END TIME. I WANT TO TELL YOU, LOOK,
[1:02:42] I I I DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER WAY OUT OF
[1:02:44] HERE. I KNOW GOD SENT A VINDICATED
[1:02:46] PROPHET JUST LIKE HE SAID NOAH. AND IF
[1:02:48] YOU WANT TO GO IN THE RAPTURE, YOU
[1:02:50] BETTER GET ON THE BOAT.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING ELSE IS SINKING. SAID, I
[1:02:55] TRIED IT OUT THERE. I WENT OUT THERE. I
[1:02:57] WANT TO TELL YOU, OH, AND NOTHING OUT
[1:02:59] THERE CAN COMPARE.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; AND I LIKE TO SAY THIS, MY BEST day
[1:03:05] as a sinner
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; is worse than my worst day as a
[1:03:09] Christian.
[1:03:12] Oh, I like saying that.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, because when you get some evidence
[1:03:16] in your life,
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; I started telling this young man, I was
[1:03:20] like, "Look, we're not we don't we don't
[1:03:21] compare ourselves to the world." I said,
[1:03:23] "We actually are supposed to compare
[1:03:25] oursel to the word."
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; I said, "The scripture said, let this
[1:03:28] mind BE IN YOU, WHICH WAS ALSO in Christ
[1:03:29] Jesus, who thought it not robbery TO BE
[1:03:31] EQUAL WITH GOD." And he kind of looked
[1:03:33] at me. I said, "Well, let me let me just
[1:03:35] say it LIKE A LIKE A PROPHET OF GOD
[1:03:36] SAID. HE HE SAID, YOU KNOW, IN A LITTLE
[1:03:38] WHILE THE WORLD seeth me no more, but
[1:03:41] you shall see me, BUT I PERSONAL
[1:03:42] PRONOUN, I'LL BE WITH YOU, EVEN IN YOU.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; He says, THEN THEN GO SEE WHAT HE DID.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; SEE THE WORKS THAT HE did and then look
[1:03:54] at your own life and then compare
[1:03:57] yourself.
[1:04:00] Now look, SATAN ALWAYS WANTS TO TURN
[1:04:02] QUOTES around and condemn us
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; when they should encourage you that
[1:04:06] there's more for you.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; LOOK THAT BY GOD'S GRACE, WE'LL GET TO
[1:04:10] THERE, BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
[1:04:11] WHEN JOSHUA AND CALEB CAME BACK WITH THE
[1:04:13] EVIDENCE HERE. They had the evidence
[1:04:15] that IT WAS EVERYTHING THAT GOD
[1:04:16] PROMISED. AND SATAN'S ALWAYS THERE TO
[1:04:18] MAKE AN EVIL REPORT. WELL, YEAH, but
[1:04:21] Well, yeah, but and SO WHENEVER YOU HEAR
[1:04:23] SOMETHING IN THE MESSAGE THAT SEEMS LIKE
[1:04:25] A GREAT CHALLENGE OR SOMETHING LIKE, MY
[1:04:26] HOW COULD I EVER GET OBTAINED? YOU OUGHT
[1:04:28] TO JUST GET EXCITED ABOUT THIS. SAY,
[1:04:29] MAN, I'M CALLED TO THAT.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I COULD LOOK INTO THE WORD
[1:04:33] AND SAY, WELL, I'M NOT QUITE ADDING UP
[1:04:35] RIGHT NOW, BUT I'M COMING.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Some people might BE FURTHER AHEAD OF
[1:04:39] ME, BUT I'M COMING. BROTHER DONNIE, JUST
[1:04:41] WAIT A LITTLE WHILE. I MIGHT NOT GET IT
[1:04:42] ALL FIGURED OUT. I might not GOT ALL THE
[1:04:44] REVELATION, AND I MIGHT MAKE A LOT OF
[1:04:45] MISTAKES, BUT I'M COMING. WHY? BECAUSE
[1:04:47] I'M THERE.
[1:04:50] HALLELUJAH. I can be like THE KID IN THE
[1:04:52] ice cream shop. I CAN JUST START GETTING
[1:04:54] HAPPY. HALLELUJAH. It's coming.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; So, just kind of move it in here. You
[1:04:59] know, YOU KNOW, CHRIST UH SHOULD BE OUR
[1:05:01] EXAMPLE.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; You know, that that's what we ought to
[1:05:04] strive TO BE AS A AS A REAL true
[1:05:06] Christian. And and so we're just moving
[1:05:09] in this thought HOW UH THE GREAT WARRIOR
[1:05:11] JOSHUA, HE LED THEM INTO THE PROMISED
[1:05:13] LAND. And and so they're no LONGER
[1:05:15] SLAVES AND AND NOW THEY'RE IN THE
[1:05:16] PROMISED LAND AND AND THEY'RE ENJOYING
[1:05:18] the blessings and the benefits and
[1:05:20] they're raising THEIR FAMILY. AND THE
[1:05:22] PROPHET SHOWS ABOUT HOW EACH ONE OF THEM
[1:05:23] CAME INTO THAT NATURAL PROMISED LAND.
[1:05:25] BUT ALL OF THEM HAD TO DIE. AND HE HE
[1:05:27] SAYS THEN ONE DAY DOWN COME THE GREATEST
[1:05:29] WARRIOR OF THEM ALL, the Lord Jesus, the
[1:05:31] son of God. And he SAID THERE IS A land
[1:05:33] where a man don't die. Amen.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "THEN ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST,
[1:05:38] HE SENT BACK THE EARNEST OF THIS PLACE,
[1:05:40] the assurance,
[1:05:42] the evidence that this land is real."
[1:05:45] JUST LIKE JOSHUA BROUGHT BACK THE
[1:05:47] EVIDENCE, Jesus brought back the
[1:05:50] evidence of the Holy Ghost. Now, we
[1:05:54] reckon ourselves dead. We're buried with
[1:05:56] him in baptism unto death, and we raise
[1:05:59] with him in the resurrection. And now we
[1:06:02] are in already.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Not we're going to
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; we're already raised. OH BY WE ARE NOW
[1:06:09] NOT WILL BE. WE ARE NOW TONIGHT SETTING
[1:06:12] IN HEAVENLY PLACES IN Christ Jesus.
[1:06:16] Amen.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; LOOK, THIS IS NOT JUST SOME HOPE SO
[1:06:20] GOSPEL WHERE WE WHERE WE JUST COME
[1:06:23] TOGETHER AND WE TALK ABOUT SOME PIE IN
[1:06:25] THE SKY AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN
[1:06:28] NEVER BE OBTAINED AND AND WE JUST KIND
[1:06:30] OF COME UP WITH CATCHPHRASES AND THINGS
[1:06:31] TO GET ALL EXCITED ABOUT AND AND AND
[1:06:34] that your FAITH MIGHT REST IN and in in
[1:06:37] in the the EXCELLENCY OF SPEECH AND THE
[1:06:39] WISDOM OF MAN. LOOK, THAT'S NOT WHY THE
[1:06:41] GOSPEL CAME. THIS GOSPEL CAME IN POWER
[1:06:43] AND MANIFESTATION OF THE HOLY GHOST THAT
[1:06:46] YOUR FAITH WOULD NOT REST IN THE WISDOM
[1:06:48] OF MAN BUT REST IN THE POWER OF GOD. AND
[1:06:51] I LIKE HOW THE PROPHET OF GOD PICKS UP
[1:06:53] THAT SCRIPTURE AND CHRIST THE MYSTERY OF
[1:06:54] GOD REVEALED AND HE SAYS IN THE POWER OF
[1:06:56] GOD TO CHANGE the [screaming] man.
[1:07:00] HEY, THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TONIGHT IS WE
[1:07:02] NEED TO BE changed
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; from THE YOUNGEST TO THE OLDEST. I DON'T
[1:07:06] CARE IF WE'VE BEEN IN THE MESSAGE OUR
[1:07:08] WHOLE LIFE. I SAY, "OH, I NEED TO BE
[1:07:09] CHANGED. LORD, MAKE ME MORE LIKE YOU,
[1:07:12] LORD. MORE MORE OF YOUR MEEKNESS, MORE
[1:07:14] OF YOUR HUMILITY, LORD, I WANT TO SEE
[1:07:16] THE EVIDENCE OF THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT
[1:07:18] IN MY LIFE.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; WELL, MY BIBLE TELLS ME IF THAT SAME
[1:07:23] SPIRIT THAT RAISED JESUS CHRIST FROM THE
[1:07:26] DEAD DWELL IN YOU,
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; IT WILL ALSO QUICKEN YOUR MORTAL BODY.
[1:07:31] AND I WANT TO TELL YOU, YES, THERE'S
[1:07:32] COMING A FINAL QUICKENING WHEN WE'LL
[1:07:34] DROP THIS MORTAL BODY AND WE'LL STEP
[1:07:37] INTO A THEOPHONY. BUT I WANT TO TELL
[1:07:38] YOU, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR THAT TO
[1:07:41] BE QUICKENED. There's a quickening POWER
[1:07:43] RIGHT NOW HERE TO QUICKEN THE
[1:07:45] PREDESTINATED SEED ON THE INSIDE of you.
[1:07:47] AND IT'LL QUICKEN THE WAY YOU THINK.
[1:07:49] IT'LL QUICKEN THE WAY YOU ACT. IT'LL
[1:07:51] QUICKEN YOUR THOUGHTS. IT'LL QUICKEN
[1:07:52] YOUR IDEAS. IT WILL QUICKEN YOU TO THE
[1:07:54] WORD. IT WILL QUICKEN YOU TO THE MESSAGE
[1:07:56] OF THE HOUR. IF YOU'RE BEING QUICKENED
[1:07:58] TO OTHER THINGS, TO MAN'S IDEAS AND
[1:08:00] MAN'S OPINIONS AND TO WEBSITES AND
[1:08:02] JEBUSITES AND ALL THESE THINGS, I WANT
[1:08:03] TO TELL YOU, IT'S NOT THE RIGHT SPIRIT.
[1:08:05] BUT THERE IS THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST THAT
[1:08:07] IS HERE. HE CAN SET YOU FREE FROM ALL OF
[1:08:09] THOSE THINGS. AND HE CAN QUICKEN YOU BY
[1:08:11] THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST TO THE
[1:08:13] WORD OF THE HOUR.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; OH, THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, HE SAID,
[1:08:17] WHEN YOU GET THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY
[1:08:19] SPIRIT, THAT'S THE EARNEST of your
[1:08:21] salvation. Is that right? IN OTHER
[1:08:22] WORDS, IT'S THE DOWN PAYMENT. And if
[1:08:24] it'll MAKE US FEEL LIKE THIS ON A DOWN
[1:08:26] PAYMENT, WHAT WILL IT DO WHEN WE GET THE
[1:08:29] full benefit?
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Well, hallelujah.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:37] Praise man.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Am I talking about salvation?
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Do I need to talk about something else
[1:08:43] to get you excited?
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; We need to talk about some ball games.
[1:08:47] We need to talk about some sports.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; We need to talk about the latest and the
[1:08:51] greatest tech.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; We We ARE WE ARE THERE. THERE IS A
[1:08:56] PROMISED LAND THAT WE ARE GOING TO
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; WHERE WE SHALL NEVER DIE.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; AND THOSE THAT WE LOVE [screaming] AND
[1:09:02] HOLD DEAR WILL SEE THEM AGAIN. And I
[1:09:04] WANT TO TELL YOU, WE HAVEN'T LOST ONE
[1:09:06] THING. HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; OH, THAT WHEN YOU GET THE BAPTISM OF THE
[1:09:11] HOLY GHOST, IT'S THE EARNEST.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE DOWN PAYMENT THAT YOU ARE YOU
[1:09:16] ALL THESE THINGS ARE YOURS.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; And the PROPHET'S SAYING, IF IT'LL MAKE
[1:09:21] YOU FEEL LIKE THAT down here,
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; WHAT WILL IT BE LIKE WHEN WE GET THERE?
[1:09:26] It ought to make YOU JUST AS EXCITED
[1:09:28] LIKE I WAS TALKING ABOUT MY SON.
[1:09:30] HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; We are going to a land where we never
[1:09:34] get old. NO, I KNOW Y'ALL young people
[1:09:37] don't got to worry about it, but no more
[1:09:38] hurting back and no more aching knees.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; And maybe some of you are,
[1:09:47] but you know what? YOU KNOW, TIME GOES
[1:09:48] ON A LITTLE BIT, YOU START appreciating
[1:09:50] that a little bit more.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; BUT I SAY IT OUGHT TO DO SOMETHING.
[1:09:54] LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, SAINTS. I WELL, I'M
[1:09:56] TRYING to minister to you a little bit
[1:09:58] on the evidence of salvation. THERE
[1:10:01] OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING EVIDENT in your
[1:10:02] life. There ought to BE SOMETHING THAT
[1:10:04] YOU POSSESS THAT IT OUGHT TO MEAN
[1:10:06] something to you.
[1:10:11] I remember one time I was at Louisiana
[1:10:14] camp many years ago and
[1:10:17] you know the the the spirit of the Lord
[1:10:18] was just moving so precious and you know
[1:10:21] it was back when when the building was
[1:10:23] split in half between a gym and a and a
[1:10:25] sanctuary and and it just seemed like
[1:10:27] all the kids that were coming through
[1:10:29] the prayer line and everything they they
[1:10:30] were all ending back up in in the gym
[1:10:33] and I just remember uh uh uh it was just
[1:10:35] such a wonderful thing. We're back there
[1:10:37] just uh just just praying and and
[1:10:39] praying with certain other young people
[1:10:40] and and and you could just see the the
[1:10:42] spirit of the Lord. It was like a wave.
[1:10:44] It would just move upon a group here and
[1:10:45] and go around. I remember it just coming
[1:10:47] over there. Oh, and there's nothing like
[1:10:49] it. It just hit the little group we were
[1:10:51] there praying with and and all a sudden
[1:10:52] this little boy, he threw us up threw up
[1:10:54] his arms. HE SAID, "IT'S REAL. IT'S
[1:10:57] REALLY REAL. IT'S NOT A STORY ANYMORE."
[1:11:01] OH, I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT IT IS, SAINTS
[1:11:02] OF GOD. WHEN THIS MESSAGE AIN'T A STORY
[1:11:05] ANYMORE. IT AIN'T A BUNCH OF RULES AND
[1:11:07] REGULATIONS AND I GOT TO WEAR MY DRESS
[1:11:09] LIKE THIS AND MY HAIR LIKE THAT AND I
[1:11:11] CAN'T GO OVER THERE AND I CAN'T GO
[1:11:12] THERE. LOOK, THAT'S JUST A BUNCH OF
[1:11:14] THAT'S JUST A THAT'S JUST YOU TRYING TO
[1:11:16] MAKE IT WORK BY YOUR OWN WORKS AND
[1:11:18] THAT'S JUST YOU LOOKING AT UH SOMETHING
[1:11:20] THAT'S A liberty to everything ELSE, BUT
[1:11:22] IT'S MORE OF A BONDAGE TO YOU. BUT WHEN
[1:11:23] YOU CATCH A REVELATION THAT IT IS THE
[1:11:25] GRACE OF GOD AND YOU'VE MET HIM FOR
[1:11:27] YOURSELF, ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU REALIZE,
[1:11:29] LOOK, MAN, THIS AIN'T THIS AIN'T SOME
[1:11:31] STORY. THIS AIN'T SOMETHING THAT'S FAKE.
[1:11:32] THIS AIN'T SOMETHING JUST MY MOMMY AND
[1:11:34] MY DADDY AND MY PRE PREACHERS AND ALL
[1:11:36] THESE PEOPLE I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.
[1:11:37] BUT WHEN YOU MEET JESUS CHRIST FACE TO
[1:11:39] FACE, YOU CAN THROW YOUR HANDS UP TO SAY
[1:11:41] IT'S NOT A STORY ANYMORE. IT'S REALLY,
[1:11:44] REALLY REAL. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU, IT
[1:11:46] CAN HAPPEN FOR YOU TONIGHT. IF IT'S JUST
[1:11:48] BEEN A STORY AND IT'S JUST BUILT WITHIN
[1:11:50] THE RULES OF REGULATION AND EVERYBODY
[1:11:52] ELSE HAS A TESTIMONY AND YOU DON'T HAVE
[1:11:54] NO TESTIMONY, IT DON'T CHANGE THE FACT
[1:11:57] THAT YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN A SON AND
[1:11:58] DAUGHTER OF GOD, BUT HE'S JUST LOOKING
[1:12:00] FOR YOU TO MAKE A SURRENDER. AND I SAY,
[1:12:02] WHY NOT TONIGHT BE THE NIGHT THAT YOU
[1:12:04] CAN GET THE EVIDENCE OF YOUR SALVATION
[1:12:06] AND your inheritance and you can just
[1:12:07] surrender YOURSELF AND COME INTO THE
[1:12:09] BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:12:12] [applause]
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; THEN IT'S A JOY TO SERVE HIM.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; OLD THINGS PASS AWAY. ALL THINGS BECOME
[1:12:22] NEW.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; You're a new creature.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Religion is a
[1:12:28] covering, but salvation is freedom."
[1:12:34] Salvation is freedom. Yes.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; So when we when we see the word of God
[1:12:44] and the standard
[1:12:47] and maybe in your heart you know there's
[1:12:49] things
[1:12:51] that are right and you don't do it
[1:12:54] and it's more of a a burden to you to
[1:12:57] try and you do good for so long.
[1:13:01] That should speak to something in your
[1:13:04] heart to say there's something more for
[1:13:08] me.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Look, I I don't know why I keep coming
[1:13:14] back to this, but I didn't have to talk
[1:13:16] my son into going to the ice cream shop.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; I didn't have say, "Well, son, you don't
[1:13:21] understand. Like, it tastes really good.
[1:13:23] You know, you'll really like it.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; It'll it'll give you so much energy.
[1:13:27] You'll be bouncing off the walls and
[1:13:29] your parents will wonder why we ever
[1:13:30] took you there.
[1:13:33] Right. But but when when when you're
[1:13:36] born again and you get a new nature,
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't got to be talked into
[1:13:40] it.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; EVEN IF I EVEN IF I REALIZE THERE'S AN
[1:13:44] AREA IN MY LIFE THAT maybe I haven't
[1:13:47] totally got the victory, something in my
[1:13:49] heart will say amen to the word of God.
[1:13:52] Lord, I know you promised it. It's it's
[1:13:54] it's NOT A IT'S NOT a burden. I've
[1:13:56] shared this many times when when I got
[1:13:58] converted and I got uh born again and
[1:14:00] filled with the Holy Ghost. You know, it
[1:14:01] was just a couple days later I was I was
[1:14:03] at my job and and forgive me for, you
[1:14:05] know, this is just what happened. I you
[1:14:07] know, lunch came up and I thought, you
[1:14:09] know, I'm I I I go I'll go next door to
[1:14:11] the pub and have a beer and I GOT FOUR
[1:14:13] FEET FOR YOU KNOW, I STARTED walking all
[1:14:15] I said [laughter]
[1:14:17] I don't even drink anymore.
[1:14:20] That's funny. And I turned around and
[1:14:23] walked right back TO MY STATION. NOW, IF
[1:14:25] I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN DOWN, oh man,
[1:14:30] I'm a Christian. I can't do that
[1:14:31] anymore.
[1:14:33] You see now? You see the difference?
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Now, once again, I'm trying TO HELP YOU
[1:14:38] YOUNG PEOPLE. I IT THAT'S THAT'S A
[1:14:40] BONDAGE. THAT'S A THAT THAT THAT MEANS
[1:14:42] SOMETHING ELSE GOTS A HOLD OF YOU. AND
[1:14:44] AND DON'T LET SATAN UH CONDEMN YOU AND
[1:14:46] HOLD YOU IN BONDAGE. THERE OUGHT TO BE
[1:14:48] SOMETHING INSIDE OF YOU. SAY, YOU KNOW
[1:14:50] WHAT? SALVATION IS FREEDOM. AND IF I
[1:14:52] DON'T HAVE A FREEDOM in the message OF
[1:14:55] THE HOUR, IF I DON'T HAVE A FREEDOM TO
[1:14:57] WEAR MY HAIR LONG, AND IF I DON'T HAVE
[1:14:59] THE FREEDOM TO DRESS IN MODESTY, AND YOU
[1:15:01] YOUNG MEN, IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE FREEDOM
[1:15:03] NOT TO GIVE INTO THOSE JOKES AND TO GO
[1:15:04] ONTO THEM WEBSITES AND TO CONSTANTLY BE
[1:15:07] BOMBARDED WITH LUST AND NEVER HAVE THE
[1:15:09] VICTORY, I WANT TO TELL YOU THERE IS AN
[1:15:11] EVIDENCE OF SALVATION THAT WILL BRING
[1:15:13] PURE LIBERTY AND FREEDOM THAT YOU CAN BE
[1:15:16] FREE FROM THOSE THINGS.
[1:15:21] Now certainly WE CAN WE CAN MAKE
[1:15:23] MISTAKES AND IF WE DON'T UH IF WE'RE NOT
[1:15:25] PRAYED UP AND and and and we're not
[1:15:27] doing THE THINGS THAT WE DO. LOOK UH YOU
[1:15:29] YOU A TEST WILL COME AND YOU'LL YOU'LL
[1:15:31] FAIL THE TEST AND YOU'LL REALIZE WELL
[1:15:32] PRAISE GOD FOR THE TEST. I I AIN'T BEEN
[1:15:34] PRAYING LIKE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN PRAYING.
[1:15:36] I I HAVEN'T BEEN READING MY BIBLE LIKE I
[1:15:38] SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN PRAYING. AND THE SON
[1:15:39] OF GOD WILL REPENT. HE'LL GET UP AND
[1:15:40] KEEP GOING ON WITH GOD.
[1:15:43] BUT IF YOU'RE JUST ALWAYS STRUGGLING AND
[1:15:45] YOU'RE ALWAYS TRYING AND AND YOU'RE
[1:15:47] ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE IT FIT, THAT'S
[1:15:49] BECAUSE THERE THERE'S A THERE'S A DEATH.
[1:15:51] THAT FIRST NATURE HAS TO DIE. AND THEN
[1:15:53] THE NATURE OF CHRIST HAS TO COME. YOU
[1:15:55] GOT TO GET THAT NATURE OF A LAMB.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; That will say yes Lord. Amen Lord. And
[1:16:01] then it becomes a liberty. It becomes a
[1:16:04] freedom.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Well, let me say it like this. I don't
[1:16:09] need the internet to be happy.
[1:16:12] I don't need social media to be happy.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; I don't need somebody to tell me I look
[1:16:17] good to be happy. I don't need my job or
[1:16:20] any of these things to tell me. Why?
[1:16:22] Because I am not even of this world. I
[1:16:25] come from another world. I came
[1:16:36] from this world.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; I salvation and my satisfaction from
[1:16:41] this world.
[1:16:44] I GET MY SATISFACTION FROM THE MESSAGE
[1:16:47] OF THE HOUR. I GET MY JOY AND MY
[1:16:50] SATISFACTION [applause] FROM JESUS
[1:16:51] CHRIST. I GET MY JOY AND MY SATISFACTION
[1:16:54] FROM THE REVEALED WORD OF THE HOUR. I
[1:16:57] DON'T NEED NO DRUGS. I DON'T NEED NO
[1:16:59] ALCOHOL. I don't need no
[1:17:05] [applause]
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; That makes me happy.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; I SAID THAT MAKES ME HAPPY.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD GET YOU
[1:17:26] DOWN
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; AND YOU FEEL LIKE NOTHING'S GOING RIGHT,
[1:17:32] START TO THINK ABOUT YOUR INHERITANCE.
[1:17:34] START TO THINK ABOUT WHERE YOU'RE GOING.
[1:17:36] THERE'S A LAND BEYOND THE RIVER. THEY
[1:17:38] CALL THE SWEET FOREVER.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:17:43] THAT'S WHERE I GET MY JOY. THAT'S WHERE
[1:17:44] I GET MY HAPPINESS. THAT'S WHERE I GET
[1:17:46] MY PEACE.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; And to think,
[1:17:50] this is JUST A SMALL LITTLE TASTE.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. I pray that somebody
[1:17:56] here this evening
[1:17:59] that the evidence of salvation will
[1:18:01] become real to you.
[1:18:03] And I just want TO SAY IT'S NOT YOUR
[1:18:05] good works.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; It's not your efforts.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; And by God's grace, we'll get to this a
[1:18:13] little later,
[1:18:15] but I want to show you how IT WAS NEVER
[1:18:17] YOUR good works or your efforts that
[1:18:20] warranted salvation.
[1:18:24] So then when you receive the evidence of
[1:18:25] salvation,
[1:18:27] you receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:18:29] Ghost, IT WAS NEVER YOUR GOOD WORKS THAT
[1:18:32] WARRANTED you to get it.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; BUT THEN SOMEHOW, YOUNG PEOPLE, WE DO
[1:18:39] SOMETHING BAD AND WE LOSE IT.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to preach to you tonight.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; SATAN KEEPS TRYING TO ROB YOU OF A TRUE
[1:18:50] EXPERIENCE WITH GOD.
[1:18:53] But it WAS NEVER YOUR GOOD WORKS THAT
[1:18:54] MADE YOU EARN IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO
[1:18:56] IT AIN'T YOUR BAD WORKS THAT CAN LOSE
[1:18:58] IT. OH, I FEEL PRETTY GOOD RIGHT NOW. IT
[1:19:00] WASN'T YOUR GOOD WORKS THAT SAVED YOU.
[1:19:02] IT AIN'T YOUR BAD WORKS THAT UNSAVE YOU.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; WELL, THAT OUGHT TO MAKE SOMEBODY GET
[1:19:07] HAPPY. THAT OUGHT TO MAKE SOMEBODY SHOUT
[1:19:09] TO KNOW THAT THIS THING'S RIGGED. I
[1:19:11] CAN'T LOSE. [applause]
[1:19:15] I CAN NO MORE DIE THAN GOD CAN DIE. HEY,
[1:19:17] THAT'S WHAT A PROPHET TOLD ME. IF YOU
[1:19:19] HAD ETERNAL LIFE, YOU ALWAYS HAD ETERNAL
[1:19:22] LIFE.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; NOW, I AIN'T DOING AWAY WITH GOOD WORKS.
[1:19:27] WE'LL GET THERE ALSO. BUT I'M TRYING TO
[1:19:29] SHOW YOU THE SCRIPTURE SAYS IN EPHESIANS
[1:19:31] 2:8, "FOR BY grace
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; you ARE SAVED THROUGH FAITH, AND NOT OF
[1:19:37] YOURSELVES. IT IS THE GIFT OF GOD, NOT
[1:19:39] OF WORKS,
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; LEST ANY MAN CAN BOAST."
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; So listen to how the prophet SAYS THIS
[1:19:46] IN THE PHILADELPHIA church age. Now
[1:19:48] works are fine
[1:19:50] but they don't save you.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Now we we God does a tremendous work in
[1:19:58] our life. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? WHEN GOD
[1:20:01] DOES A TRUE WORK IN your life, the test
[1:20:03] is coming.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; And brother Donnie can correct me if I'm
[1:20:10] wrong,
[1:20:12] BUT YOU DON'T PASS EVERY SINGLE ONE of
[1:20:14] them
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; the first time.
[1:20:21] GOD DID SOMETHING IN YOUR LIFE.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; NOW, I I WHAT I WANT TO TRY TO GET TO
[1:20:25] YOU YOUNG PEOPLE, QUIT LOOKING AT THE
[1:20:27] SYMPTOMS.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Quit looking at the giants IN THE LAND.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; QUIT LOOKING AT ALL THE THINGS YOU GOT
[1:20:34] TO OVERCOME.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Look at the promise.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; YOU COME TO THE ALTAR. YOU PRAYED. YOU
[1:20:41] REPENTED OF YOUR SINS. YOU GOT UP WITH
[1:20:43] FAITH IN YOUR HEART. YOU CONFESSED. AND
[1:20:45] SALVATION IS MADE. CONFESSION. SALVATION
[1:20:48] IS MADE UNDER CONFESSION. AND YOU
[1:20:49] PROFESS, I'M A BORNAG AGAIN SON OF GOD.
[1:20:52] HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; And then you come to the test
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; and you fail.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Does that change that you're a son or
[1:21:06] daughter of God?
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Should that change your confession?
[1:21:13] I I
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; works don't save you in the first place.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Hold on. This is a vindicated prophet. I
[1:21:22] love this stuff. They don't make you
[1:21:25] perfect.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:28] YOU MEAN ALL THIS TIME I'VE HAD THE HOLY
[1:21:30] GHOST AND I'M TRYING TO MAKE MYSELF
[1:21:33] PERFECT BY MY OWN EFFORT BY MY OWN
[1:21:37] ABILITY AND EVERY TEST AND EVERY TRIAL.
[1:21:40] IF I FAIL IT OR IF I PASS IT, I'M
[1:21:43] MEASURING MY SUCCESS BY MY ABILITIES.
[1:21:47] AND YOU ARE NEVER [screaming] CALLED
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; TO MEASURE YOUR SALVATION AND THE GRACE
[1:21:53] OF GOD IN YOUR LIFE BY YOUR WORKS.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T MAKE YOU PERFECT. IT IS
[1:22:01] CHRIST or perish. And it is NOT EVEN
[1:22:04] CHRIST AND WORKS.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; It is Christ alone.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; This age began in the years of
[1:22:11] ARMENIANISM THAT DOES NOT BELIEVE IN
[1:22:13] CHRIST as a reality. IT DOES NOT SING OF
[1:22:16] NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD. FOR IT SINGS OF
[1:22:19] NOTHING BUT the blood and my own
[1:22:22] conduct.
[1:22:24] OH, IF THE DEVIL HAS HASN'T EVER BEEN ON
[1:22:26] a rampage with us to THINK THAT IT HAD
[1:22:29] ANYTHING TO DO WITH OUR GOOD EFFORTS AND
[1:22:31] OUR GOOD WORKS IN THE FIRST PLACE, IT
[1:22:34] AIN'T NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD AND YOUR OWN
[1:22:36] GOOD WORKS. IT'S NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD
[1:22:38] AND IT IS CHRIST ALONE.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; NOW, I believe in good conduct. If you
[1:22:45] are saved, you will do righteously. We
[1:22:48] have already gone over that. But let me
[1:22:50] tell you now, salvation is not Jesus
[1:22:55] plus.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; It is Jesus alone.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Salvation is of the Lord from start to
[1:23:05] finish. IT IS ALL GOD. LET HIS LIFE be
[1:23:09] in me. LET IT BE HIS BLOOD THAT CLEANSES
[1:23:11] ME. LET IT BE HIS SPIRIT THAT FILLS ME.
[1:23:14] LET IT BE HIS WORD IN MY HEART AND IN MY
[1:23:16] MOUTH. LET IT BE HIS STRIPES THAT HEAL
[1:23:18] ME. LET IT BE JESUS AND JESUS ALONE, NOT
[1:23:22] BY WORKS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS WHICH I HAVE
[1:23:24] DONE. NO SIR, CHRIST IS MY LIFE. YOU ARE
[1:23:28] NOT SAVED BY YOUR GOOD WORKS. YOU ARE
[1:23:30] SAVED BY THE GRACE OF ALMIGHTY GOD.
[1:23:33] SALVATION IS OF THE LORD FROM START TO
[1:23:36] FINISH. MY BIBLE SAYS AND NEITHER IS
[1:23:38] THERE SALVATION IN ANY OTHER. FOR THERE
[1:23:40] IS NO OTHER NAME UNDER HEAVEN GIVEN
[1:23:42] AMONG MEN WHEREBY MEN MUST BE SAVED
[1:23:45] OTHER THAN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS
[1:23:47] CHRIST. I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT'S THE
[1:23:49] NAME ABOVE ALL NAMES. THERE'S NO NAME
[1:23:51] GREATER. THERE'S NO NAME HIGHER. EVERY
[1:23:54] TONGUE AND EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW AND
[1:23:56] CONFESS THAT HE IS THE LORD OF LORDS. HE
[1:23:58] IS THE KING OF KINGS. HE IS THE ALPHA.
[1:24:00] HE IS THE OMEGA. HE IS THE ROSE OF
[1:24:03] SHARED. HE IS THE OFFSPRING OF DAVID.
[1:24:05] HE'S THE MIGHTY CONQUEROR. HE'S THE GOD
[1:24:07] THAT CONQUERS ALL. HE CONQUERED DEATH,
[1:24:09] HELL, AND THE GRAVE. HE IS MY SAVIOR AND
[1:24:12] MY SALVATION IS HIM AND HIM ALONE. LET
[1:24:14] IT BE HIS BLOOD THAT CLEANSES ME. LET IT
[1:24:17] BE HIS SPIRIT THAT FILLS ME. LET IT BE
[1:24:18] HIS WORD IN MY HEART AND IN MY MOUTH.
[1:24:21] LET IT BE HIS STRIPES THAT HEAL ME. LET
[1:24:23] IT BE JESUS AND JESUS ALONE, NOT BY
[1:24:26] WORKS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS WHICH I HAVE
[1:24:28] DONE.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:34] Oh, praise his wonderful name. But you
[1:24:36] don't understand, brother Matthew.
[1:24:40] I've gone too far.
[1:24:44] I've tried so many times.
[1:24:49] Just this recent camp, maybe I went to
[1:24:52] the altar. I experienced the Lord. I
[1:24:55] even confessed I had the Holy Ghost and
[1:24:58] I w I went right back and I got mixed up
[1:25:00] in this thing and now I'm lost. Now I
[1:25:03] there's no hope for me.
[1:25:06] Says who?
[1:25:12] My Bible said where sin abound,
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; grace
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; did much more abound.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Devil, I don't care how much sin. I
[1:25:23] don't care about how much unbelief. I
[1:25:25] don't CARE HOW MANY FAULTS. I DON'T CARE
[1:25:27] HOW MANY FAILURES. YOU CAN POINT TO THIS
[1:25:29] MISTAKE. YOU CAN POINT TO THAT MISTAKE.
[1:25:31] YOU CAN SAY, "I'M THE WORST SINNER there
[1:25:33] ever was in the world." But then MY LORD
[1:25:35] AND SAVIOR WHO CONQUERED DEATH, HELL,
[1:25:37] AND THE GRAVE, HE CAME BACK AND SAID,
[1:25:39] "SON, IT DON'T MATTER WHERE SIN ABOUND.
[1:25:41] Grace did much MORE ABOUND." THERE'S
[1:25:44] GRACE FOR EVERY WEAKNESS. THERE'S GRACE
[1:25:46] FOR EVERY TRIAL. THERE'S GRACE FOR EVERY
[1:25:48] MISTAKE.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; I don't KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I FEEL
[1:25:52] PRETTY GOOD RIGHT NOW CUZ I I DON'T
[1:25:54] ALWAYS GET IT RIGHT. I MAKE MISTAKES. I
[1:25:56] FALL FLAT ON MY FACE, BUT IT DOESN'T
[1:25:58] CHANGE THAT I'M A SON OF GOD. IT DOESN'T
[1:26:00] CHANGE THAT I'M GOING TO RAPTURE. IT
[1:26:01] DOESN'T CHANGE THAT I GOT THE HOLY
[1:26:03] GHOST. HALLELUJAH.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I'M AN HEIR.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; FIRST THESSALONIANS 5:9. FOR GOD HATH
[1:26:13] not appointed us under wrath,
[1:26:18] but to obtain salvation by our Lord
[1:26:20] Jesus. Now, we'll try to start moving
[1:26:22] towards a close. Hallelujah. The prophet
[1:26:25] says, now we've moved to that sermon
[1:26:26] he's been referring to and possessing
[1:26:28] all things. He says, "Hallelujah. There
[1:26:30] you are. This is my story. This is my
[1:26:33] song. I'm an heir of salvation. Look, I
[1:26:37] I I don't know where where each of you
[1:26:39] are at in the journey.
[1:26:42] I know there's some here that you're
[1:26:43] only here because your parents made you
[1:26:45] come. And
[1:26:47] I was I was there.
[1:26:50] That's okay.
[1:26:52] That's all right. Maybe some of you,
[1:26:55] you're you're struggling in
[1:26:56] sanctification. Maybe you've been born
[1:26:58] again and filled with the Holy. Maybe
[1:26:59] you're believing for the Holy Ghost.
[1:27:00] Maybe you made a confession and and here
[1:27:02] at this last camp, you went right back
[1:27:04] and went into the same traps that you
[1:27:06] you were believing and professing to be
[1:27:08] out uh uh delivered from.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Listen to this now. But I'm wanting I'm
[1:27:18] wanting us to start looking at the word.
[1:27:22] Look at the promise. Look at the
[1:27:24] evidence.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Look at what God has done. Look at what
[1:27:28] he's doing. Look at where you are.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; And if you know you need him, then you
[1:27:34] need to make a decision.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; I I I made the decision when I was 21
[1:27:40] years old.
[1:27:42] I could have saved myself a lot of
[1:27:44] scars, a lot of heartache.
[1:27:51] I'm an heir of salvation. What is
[1:27:53] salvation? It's something that's given
[1:27:55] to you. It's a gift.
[1:27:58] Are are you hearing me?
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; I'M HEIR OF SALVATION. WHAT KIND? FOR
[1:28:02] ETERNAL LIFE. SALVATION for my soul.
[1:28:04] Salvation for my body. SALVATION FOR MY
[1:28:06] WEARINESS. SALVATION FOR EVERYTHING. GOD
[1:28:09] MADE ME HEIR OF EVERYTHING THROUGH
[1:28:11] CHRIST. AND HE DIED AND ROSE AND
[1:28:13] RETURNED BACK AND BROUGHT THE EVIDENCE
[1:28:15] AND POURED IT OUT UPON US. OH. OH MY
[1:28:18] GLORY. OH MY. NOW YOU YOU YOU GO UP
[1:28:20] THERE. WHAT DO YOU DO? WE WE YOU GO UP
[1:28:23] JUST LIKE ABRAHAM DID. GO UP THERE WITH
[1:28:24] THAT PROMISE.
[1:28:26] GOD, you told me it's mine. I got faith
[1:28:29] in your promise. I'm bringing your word.
[1:28:31] You promised this. YOU SAID, "ASK AND
[1:28:33] YOU SHALL RECEIVE. Seek and you shall
[1:28:35] find. Ask and it shall be given. Knock
[1:28:37] and it shall be opened." HERE I AM,
[1:28:38] LORD. I DON'T KNOW. IS THERE SOMEBODY
[1:28:40] HERE THAT WANTS THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY
[1:28:41] GHOST? IS THERE SOMEBODY HERE THAT WANTS
[1:28:43] TO BE DELIVERED? IS THERE SOMEBODY HERE
[1:28:44] THAT WANTS TO LIVE AN OVERCOMING LIFE?
[1:28:46] GOD, IS THERE SOMEBODY HERE THAT LOOKS
[1:28:47] INTO THE WORD OF GOD? AND YOU KNOW,
[1:28:48] THERE'S A PROMISE FOR YOU. IS THERE
[1:28:50] SOMEBODY HERE?
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; AM I THE ONLY ONE? YOUNG PEOPLE, HELP ME
[1:28:53] OUT HERE. IS THERE SOMEBODY HERE THAT
[1:28:55] WANTS THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST? IS
[1:28:56] THERE SOMEBODY HERE THAT WANTS
[1:28:57] DELIVERANCE? IS THERE SOMEBODY here that
[1:28:59] wants to be an overcomer? IS THERE
[1:29:01] SOMEBODY HERE THAT LOOKS INTO THE WORD
[1:29:02] OF GOD AND YOU SEE THINGS IN YOUR LIFE
[1:29:04] THAT AREN'T MEASURING UP? IS THERE
[1:29:06] SOMEBODY HERE THAT SAYS, "LORD, I WANT
[1:29:08] TO MANIFEST THAT PROMISE IN MY LIFE."
[1:29:10] THEN YOU CAN TAKE THAT WORD OF GOD AND
[1:29:12] SAY, "LORD, HERE I AM. I'M COMING IT.
[1:29:15] I'M KNOCKING. ASK AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE.
[1:29:17] SEEK AND YOU SHALL FIND AND IT SHALL BE
[1:29:19] GIVEN. KNOCK and it shall be open. Here
[1:29:21] I am, Lord. I'm here. I'M KNOCKING. I'M
[1:29:24] SEEKING. I'M ASKING. I'VE GOT TO RECEIVE
[1:29:27] IT. THERE YOU ARE. SOMETHING TAKES PLACE
[1:29:29] when you lay that word down.
[1:29:33] [cheering]
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Young people, GOD IS LOOKING FOR SOME OF
[1:29:35] YOU TONIGHT TO LAY THAT WORD DOWN AND
[1:29:38] SAY, "I'M STAKING IT ALL ON YOUR WORD.
[1:29:41] LORD, YOU PROMISED IT AND I'M STAYING
[1:29:43] WITH IT. I DON'T CARE HOW HARD IT GETS.
[1:29:45] I DON'T CARE HOW THE DEVIL RAGES AND HOW
[1:29:47] HE ROARS AND HOW HE TRIES TO POINT TO
[1:29:49] THIS FOG AND THIS FAILURE. LORD, YOU
[1:29:51] PROMISED IT AND I'M AN HEIR OF ALL
[1:29:54] THINGS.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; LOOK, it's all yours. You're an heir.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT A JOY, PEACE,
[1:30:01] DELIVERANCE, THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; SO, we just we'll end along these lines
[1:30:07] here with the help of God. SO, HERE IN
[1:30:08] OUR TEXT, JOSHUA BROUGHT BACK THE
[1:30:10] EVIDENCE.
[1:30:12] Here it is.
[1:30:14] [snorts]
[1:30:15] He said, "It's a a land
[1:30:18] flowing with milk and honey." Maybe the
[1:30:19] kids are like, "Where's the bucket of
[1:30:21] milk?"
[1:30:23] Oh, it's it's it's a a land plentiful.
[1:30:25] It's it has a bunch of fruits and a and
[1:30:29] it it has everything that we have need
[1:30:31] of. It's a fertile land and IT HAS
[1:30:33] EVERYTHING. OH, OKAY. OKAY. AND HERE'S
[1:30:35] JOSHUA SAYING, "HEY, it's everything
[1:30:37] that God said it was."
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; But guess who's right there to bring up
[1:30:42] an evil report.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; So that's where we continue in Numbers
[1:30:45] 13:28. It says, "Nevertheless, the
[1:30:47] people be strong that dwell in the land,
[1:30:49] and the cities are walled and very
[1:30:51] great. And moreover, we saw the children
[1:30:53] of Anoch there. The Amalocites dwell in
[1:30:55] the land of the south, and the Hittites,
[1:30:56] the Jebsites, and the Amorites dwell in
[1:30:58] the mountains, and the Canaanites dwell
[1:30:59] by the sea and BY THE COAST OF JORDAN."
[1:31:02] And now, what's happening? ALL OF A
[1:31:03] SUDDEN, JOSHUA AND CALEB have brought
[1:31:05] back an evidence. But isn't it funny how
[1:31:07] the devil has his own evidence?
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to help you fight right now.
[1:31:11] I'm trying to help you ON HOW GOD GIVES
[1:31:13] YOU AN EVIDENCE. GOD GIVES YOU AN
[1:31:14] EXPERIENCE. GOD BLESSES YOU. YOU HAVE AN
[1:31:16] EXPERIENCE. YOU KNOW, MAYBE MAYBE IT'S
[1:31:17] AN EXPERIENCE OF JUSTIFICATION. MAYBE
[1:31:19] MAYBE YOU'RE IN THAT THAT WORK OF
[1:31:21] SANCTIFICATION. MAYBE YOU'VE BEEN UH UH
[1:31:22] BORN AGAIN AND FILLED WITH THE HOLY
[1:31:24] GHOST AND YOU HAVE AN EVIDENCE THE GRACE
[1:31:25] OF GOD IN YOUR LIFE. GOD IS DOING
[1:31:27] SOMETHING. AND AS SOON AS YOU START TO
[1:31:29] PRESENT THE EVIDENCE and you SAY, "LOOK
[1:31:30] WHAT GOD DID FOR ME. I BROTHER D. I WAS
[1:31:32] REALLY BLESSED AT CAMP LAST TIME. GOD
[1:31:34] REALLY COME BY AND HE HE HE HE TOUCHED
[1:31:37] ME AND I'M REALLY ON FIRE FOR GOD." AND
[1:31:39] ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT DEVIL COMES UP AND
[1:31:41] SAYS, "YEAH, but Come on. Amen.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; You know, you got to go back to school.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; You You got to go to work. You got to go
[1:31:50] back out and, you know, YOU GOT TO DO
[1:31:51] ALL THESE THINGS AND WELL, WHAT ABOUT
[1:31:53] THIS AND YOU SUBSCRIBE TO THAT AND YOU
[1:31:55] LIKE THIS AND you got this channel and
[1:31:56] you got that and and all these things.
[1:31:58] AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE STARTS TO PAINT
[1:32:00] THIS big picture
[1:32:02] OF HOW HARD IT'S GOING TO be
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; and how you can Oh, you could never No,
[1:32:07] that's that's for everybody else. YOU
[1:32:09] JUST YOU JUST HAVE YOUR little
[1:32:10] experience, but you can still hold on to
[1:32:12] all those other things.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; See, THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID IN
[1:32:16] REDEMPTION BY JUDGMENT, HE SAID,
[1:32:17] "EVERYTHING WITHOUT FAITH IS SIN.
[1:32:19] Unbelief is absolutely sin. Everything
[1:32:22] that's not OF FAITH IS NOT OF GOD. You
[1:32:24] must believe." And the only way you CAN
[1:32:26] HAVE FAITH IS FIRST SEE WHAT GOD said
[1:32:28] about it.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Well, ain't that the only thing that
[1:32:31] matters?
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; And then believe his word. That's the
[1:32:36] only way you can do it.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Do I need to read it again?
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; SO JOSHUA AND CALEB KNEW THAT GOD had
[1:32:46] promised and they came back. They wasn't
[1:32:49] afraid to say, "We can take it." G
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; because they based their faith not on
[1:32:57] what they saw
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; but what they believed.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Now there's the key, young people. Are
[1:33:05] you looking at the promise
[1:33:08] or are you looking at the symptoms?
[1:33:10] Are
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; are YOU LOOKING AT THE WORD or are you
[1:33:12] looking at your ability?
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Are are YOU LOOKING AT THE challenge
[1:33:18] or are you looking at the promise?
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Hey, let's get down home where we're
[1:33:26] living.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; You got friends. We go to school. WE GOT
[1:33:29] JOBS. things you subscribe to and and
[1:33:32] you you got apps on your phone you
[1:33:34] shouldn't have and all these things and
[1:33:36] and you know you you know that there's A
[1:33:38] HIGHER CALLING AND A HIGHER CALLING IN
[1:33:40] THE WAY YOU'RE dressing and a HIGHER
[1:33:41] CALLING IN THE WAY YOU'RE acting and the
[1:33:43] people that you're associating with and
[1:33:45] the things that you're liking and the
[1:33:46] things that you're subscribing. You know
[1:33:48] what would Jesus do? I don't think he'd
[1:33:50] be subscribing to that. I don't think
[1:33:51] he'd be liking that. I don't think he'd
[1:33:53] be following that profile.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Right? There's a lot of things that
[1:33:59] we're doing. There's a lot of things
[1:34:01] that we're subscribing to. And then we
[1:34:03] we make a profession. We say, "You know
[1:34:05] what? I really do. I'm going to I'm
[1:34:06] going to clean up my life." But then
[1:34:08] what happens? Satan's right there to
[1:34:09] start trying to make a compromise and
[1:34:11] try to say, "Well, you don't have to
[1:34:12] give up this. You don't have to give up
[1:34:14] that."
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; But I like verse 30. It says, "AND CALEB
[1:34:21] STEALED the people before Moses [snorts]
[1:34:23] and said, 'Let us go over at once and
[1:34:26] possess it, for we are well able
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; to overcome it."
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; I'm wondering, DO WE HAVE SOME JOSHUA
[1:34:34] and Caleb still?
[1:34:37] is there's some young men and some young
[1:34:39] women
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; THAT REGARDLESS OF THE OPPOSITION,
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; REGARDLESS OF ALL THE GIANTS, REGARDLESS
[1:34:47] OF HOW BAD LADY OSIA LOOKS, NO MATTER H
[1:34:50] HOW HARD IT MIGHT LOOK AT SCHOOL, HOW
[1:34:52] HARD IT MIGHT LOOK AT YOUR JOB, IS THERE
[1:34:54] SOME JOSHUA AND CALEBS THAT'LL STAND UP
[1:34:56] AND SAY, "LOOK, I DON'T CARE HOW DARK IT
[1:34:58] IS IN LADY OSIA. I DON'T CARE HOW BAD
[1:35:00] THE ENTICEMENTS ARE. I DON'T CARE HOW
[1:35:02] BAD BIG THE GIANTS ARE. WE ARE WELL MORE
[1:35:05] ABLE TO TAKE THE LAND BECAUSE GOD
[1:35:07] PROMISED IT. IT'S OUR INHERITANCE. LOOK,
[1:35:09] YOUNG PEOPLE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BOW
[1:35:11] YOURSELF DOWN TO THE GOD OF THIS EVIL
[1:35:12] AGE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BOW YOURSELF DOWN
[1:35:14] TO THAT NONSENSE. YOU CAN LOOK AT GOD'S
[1:35:16] WORD AND SAY, "GOD PROMISED IT. IT'S MY
[1:35:18] INHERITANCE. I CAN HAVE TOTAL VICTORY. I
[1:35:21] DON'T CARE ABOUT THE GIANTS OF
[1:35:22] DEPRESSION. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE
[1:35:24] GIANTS OF PORNOGRAPHY AND ALL THEM
[1:35:26] THINGS THAT ARE OUT THERE IN THE WORLD.
[1:35:27] GOD, GIVE ME THE HOLY GHOST TO DEFEAT
[1:35:30] EVERY SINGLE DEVIL AND EVERY SINGLE
[1:35:32] DEMON. AND WE ARE WELL MORE ABLE TO TAKE
[1:35:35] THE LAND. COME ON, YOUNG PEOPLE. YOU CAN
[1:35:37] TAKE THE LAND. YOU CAN DO IT. YOU CAN
[1:35:40] PUT EVERY DEVIL, EVERY COMPLEX, EVERY
[1:35:42] SIN, EVERY OH, COME ON. YOU'RE MORE THAN
[1:35:45] ABLE TO DO IT.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; IT'S YOUR INHERITANCE. IT'S WHAT YOU'VE
[1:35:50] BEEN CALLED TO DO.
[1:35:53] [applause]
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God SAID, "THE PROMISE IS
[1:35:57] YOURS."
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:36:00] But if you ever get it,
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; you ain't going to get it easy.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you that you're going
[1:36:08] to have to take it away from Satan.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Satan captures your health.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; You got a right to say, "Satan,
[1:36:16] give it back.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Hand it over. I come in the name of the
[1:36:20] Lord, the possessor of heaven and earth,
[1:36:22] and I'm heir. GIVE IT BACK. YOU TOOK MY
[1:36:24] CHILD. YOU GOT HER MIXED UP WITH THE
[1:36:26] WRONG BOY. YOU TOOK MY BOY AND YOU MIXED
[1:36:29] HIM UP WITH the wrong girl. I CLAIM
[1:36:30] THEM. THAT'S RIGHT. I CLAIM MY CHILDREN.
[1:36:33] I CLAIM MY BROTHER. I CLAIM MY SISTER.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; NOW, maybe you're that boy.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're that girl
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; AND YOU FEEL TRAPPED AND YOU FEEL LIKE
[1:36:45] THERE'S NO WAY OUT AND YOU DON'T KNOW
[1:36:46] WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; We have a right.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:58] And I I feel it right now. I have a
[1:37:01] right as a son of God to say, "SATAN,
[1:37:04] YOU TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF OF GOD'S
[1:37:06] PROPERTY.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; GIVE THEM BACK IN THE NAME OF THE LORD
[1:37:09] JESUS CHRIST. I CLAIM MY BROTHER. I
[1:37:11] CLAIM MY SISTER. YOU GOT THEM MIXED UP
[1:37:13] OUT THERE IN THE WORLD WITH SOME BOY OR
[1:37:15] SOME GIRL OR SOME TEMPTATION OR SOME
[1:37:17] LESS DEVIL. I REBUKE YOU IN THE NAME OF
[1:37:20] THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. I CLAIM THEM FOR
[1:37:22] THE GLORY OF ALMIGHTY GOD. YOU CAN BE
[1:37:24] FREE IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS
[1:37:26] CHRIST.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; NOW, I want to speak to somebody.
[1:37:42] If you've never received the Holy Ghost
[1:37:46] as yet,
[1:37:49] don't know nothing about it.
[1:37:52] We've been preaching on the evidence of
[1:37:53] salvation.
[1:37:55] And maybe somebody here's like, "I don't
[1:37:57] even have a clue. What does that even
[1:37:59] mean?"
[1:38:01] Holy Ghost. I hear all about the Holy
[1:38:03] Ghost.
[1:38:07] If you've never received the Holy Ghost
[1:38:08] as of yet and don't know nothing about
[1:38:11] it
[1:38:12] and something in your heart telling you
[1:38:15] that you want it,
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; you stay right there.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; That's eternal life.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; That's what you're heir to.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Stay right there
[1:38:27] and look Satan right in the face and
[1:38:30] say,
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; "You mean you you don't even have to
[1:38:34] have the Holy Ghost yet?" That's right.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; YOU MEAN I HAVE AUTHORITY AS A SON OF
[1:38:42] GOD EVEN WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST?
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. WHAT ARE WE TAPPING
[1:38:47] INTO, young people?
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL TRIES TO SAY, "WELL, YOU DON'T
[1:38:50] GOT THE HOLY GHOST. YOU DON'T GOT THIS,
[1:38:52] AND YOU DON'T GOT THAT, AND A VINDICATED
[1:38:54] PROPHET COMES AROUND, SAYS, "IF YOU
[1:38:55] DON'T GOT THE HOLY GHOST, AND YOU DON'T
[1:38:57] EVEN KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT,
[1:39:00] YOU LOOK SATAN RIGHT IN THE FACE AND
[1:39:02] SAY, YOU ARE THE ROBBER. YOU ARE THE ONE
[1:39:04] I'VE COME TO POSSESS WHAT JESUS CHRIST
[1:39:07] DIED for
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; for ME TO HAVE. NOW HAND IT BACK. GET
[1:39:12] OUT OF MY WAY. THEN THE FIRST THING YOU
[1:39:14] KNOW, THE HOLY GHOST WILL POUR DOWN UPON
[1:39:16] YOU. THEN SOMETHING HAPPENS. SOMETHING
[1:39:19] WILL HAPPEN. HALLELUJAH. GOD VINDICATES
[1:39:21] HIS WORD. I SAY EVERYBODY IN HERE, YOU
[1:39:23] GOT TO LOOK THAT OLD DEVIL IN THE FACE
[1:39:25] AND SAY, "SATAN, YOU'RE THE OLD ROBBER.
[1:39:27] GOD, GIVE IT TO ME. GIVE IT BACK. I'M
[1:39:29] GOING TO TAKE BACK THE JOY OF MY
[1:39:31] SALVATION. I'M TAKING BACK MY PEACE. I'M
[1:39:34] TAKING BACK MY VICTORY. I'M TAKING BACK
[1:39:36] MY SONG. I'M TAKING BACK MY DANCE. I AM
[1:39:39] A SON OF GOD. I'M A CHILD OF GOD. I'M
[1:39:41] HEIR OF ALL THINGS. I AM DELIVERED. I AM
[1:39:44] FREE. I DO GOT THE HOLY GHOST. I DO GOT
[1:39:47] JOY. I DO GOT PEACE. I AM GOING TO
[1:39:49] RAPTURE. I AM GOING TO GET MY HEALING.
[1:39:52] I'LL GET MY BROTHER. I'LL GET MY SISTER.
[1:39:54] I'LL CLAIM THEM. IF THEY GOT MIXED UP IN
[1:39:56] THE THINGS OF THE WORLD, I CLAIM THEM
[1:39:58] FOR THE GLORY OF ALMIGHTY GOD.
[1:40:00] HALLELUJAH.
[1:40:02] HALLELUJAH. [cheering]
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; SATAN, YOU'RE THE ROBBER.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; The musicians will come.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; He is the captain
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; OF OUR SALVATION.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Salvation is of THE LORD WHOM THE SON
[1:40:22] HAS MADE free is free [screaming]
[1:40:25] indeed.
[1:40:27] Amen.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; I wonder if somebody wants to say like
[1:40:32] Caleb and Joshua,
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; LET US GO UP AT once
[1:40:38] and possess it
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; for we are well able to overcome it.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Just what Joshua did for the children of
[1:40:49] Israel, Joshua means savior. THE WORD
[1:40:53] JOSHUA. AND THAT'S the same thing Jesus
[1:40:55] done for the church when they killed
[1:40:57] him. He conquered death. He conquered
[1:40:59] hell. He conquered THE GRAVE. HE ROSE up
[1:41:02] again with THE EVIDENCE, THE BAPTISM OF
[1:41:04] THE HOLY GHOST, THAT THERE IS A LAND
[1:41:07] BEYOND THE RIVER THAT THEY CALL THE
[1:41:09] SWEET FOREVER. AMEN. HE COME BACK AND
[1:41:11] BROUGHT US AN EVIDENCE. WHAT DOES IT DO,
[1:41:13] BROTHER BRANDHAM? IT MAKES YOU STOP YOUR
[1:41:15] LYING, STEALING, DRINKING, CURSING,
[1:41:18] IMMORALS, EVERYTHING. IT MAKES A new
[1:41:20] creature OUT OF YOU. I WHO WAS ONCE DEAD
[1:41:22] IN SIN AND TRESPASSES, NEVERTHELESS, I
[1:41:25] LIVE, NOT ME, BUT CHRIST LIVES IN ME.
[1:41:27] I'M A NEW CREATURE IN CHRIST JESUS.
[1:41:29] AMEN. HEIR TO the promise. HALLELUJAH.
[1:41:32] YES, SIR. THAT LAND BELONGS TO US. HOW
[1:41:34] DO YOU KNOW? JOSHUA ROSE FROM THE DEAD,
[1:41:37] BROUGHT BACK THE EVIDENCE, THE HOLY
[1:41:38] GHOST, AND I GOT IT. AMEN. GLORY. I'M AN
[1:41:42] HEIR. I'M A CHILD OF THE KING,
[1:41:45] [screaming] HEIR TO ALL THINGS. I WANT
[1:41:47] TO TELL YOU YOUNG PEOPLE, THERE IS A
[1:41:48] REAL BORN-AGAIN EXPERIENCE. AND BAPTISM
[1:41:51] OF THE HOLY GHOST. DON'T YOU LET ANY
[1:41:53] PREACHER, DON'T YOU LET ANYBODY EVER
[1:41:55] TELL YOU THAT IT WAS FOR A DAY GONE BY.
[1:41:57] THERE IS A REAL BAPTISM OF THE HOLY
[1:41:59] GHOST WHERE YOU MEET THE PILLAR OF FIRE
[1:42:01] AND IT'LL CHANGE YOU IN A MOMENT. I WANT
[1:42:03] TO TELL YOU JUST ONE ONE MOMENT IN HIS
[1:42:05] PRESENCE. IT'LL CHANGE EVERYTHING. IT'LL
[1:42:08] CHANGE YOUR SITUATION. IT'LL CHANGE WHAT
[1:42:10] YOU'RE BATTLING.
[1:42:13] [applause]
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; And I want to invite you
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; to receive the evidence of salvation.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:20] Yes, sir.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost. Why don't
[1:42:24] you all stand as we sing something?
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just play something?
[1:42:42] Look, I I don't know maybe where to go
[1:42:44] from here, but
[1:42:48] I kind of wanted to preach something
[1:42:49] [music] different, but
[1:42:52] Lord just kept bringing this back to me.
[1:42:57] You ask me, "Brother Matthew, what does
[1:43:00] salvation mean to you?"
[1:43:07] I was such a rotten sinner.
[1:43:14] I was deserving to go to hell.
[1:43:18] I've done so many bad things.
[1:43:22] Oh,
[1:43:24] if Satan could point to a past,
[1:43:29] he could try to point to mine, but it
[1:43:31] wouldn't do him any good.
[1:43:34] Cuz my Bible says,
[1:43:38] "If you call upon the name of the Lord,
[1:43:40] you shall be saved."
[1:43:43] And one day I had gotten myself into
[1:43:45] some pretty big messes
[1:43:48] in trouble with the law and I was
[1:43:51] wanting to clean up my life and I
[1:43:52] realized I didn't have the strength. I
[1:43:54] didn't have the ability.
[1:43:58] I wanted to but there was something else
[1:44:00] there saying
[1:44:02] no way. I remember saying God whatever
[1:44:05] this is it's bigger than me
[1:44:08] and I need your help.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; And it was that day that the Holy Spirit
[1:44:13] dropped down into my life.
[1:44:17] I made a move for him. Maybe I could
[1:44:20] share this portion another time, but I
[1:44:23] made a move for God. I I meant business.
[1:44:25] I I made an action
[1:44:28] and all a sudden the sweetest
[1:44:30] presence, the greatest feeling just
[1:44:32] dropped down and
[1:44:35] it changed me.
[1:44:38] I I got a new nature. I became a new
[1:44:40] creature.
[1:44:43] That's God's transforming power
[1:44:49] and [music] my past just became a
[1:44:51] testimony.
[1:44:53] Just like the woman at the well, [music]
[1:44:56] she went to the well and the word
[1:44:57] started to discern her thought, the
[1:44:58] thoughts of intents of her heart.
[1:45:02] And just think, the very reason she was
[1:45:04] at the well that time of day is [music]
[1:45:05] because she was an outcast.
[1:45:08] But when she met the Lord Jesus, she ran
[1:45:11] back with a joy into the city and said,
[1:45:13] "Come see a man [music] who told me all
[1:45:16] the things that I've done."
[1:45:18] Look, I know that many of us have grown
[1:45:21] up in church and we've grown up on
[1:45:23] message pews
[1:45:26] and sometimes it's real hard when we've
[1:45:28] made mistakes and we've done things we
[1:45:30] shouldn't have done. We feel like
[1:45:31] there's a microscope.
[1:45:34] But I want to tell you one moment in his
[1:45:35] presence,
[1:45:37] we'll turn all that into just to a
[1:45:39] testimony. [music]
[1:45:42] Is there somebody here that wants to
[1:45:44] experience that? I I I'm I'm just
[1:45:46] leaving this up to the Lord. How however
[1:45:48] the Lord would move, I'm
[1:45:50] I'm just asking, you know, is
[1:45:54] I just want to see God do something for
[1:45:55] you that he [music] did for me.
[1:45:58] A true change. Not not trying to
[1:46:03] not struggling and pulling [music] and
[1:46:05] trying and doing good for 2 months and 6
[1:46:09] months and falling back to bondage to
[1:46:13] certain things and only to feel like to
[1:46:16] start it over again.
[1:46:19] Am I talking to somebody? Is there
[1:46:20] somebody here know? [music] Help me out.
[1:46:21] Young people, come on. Look, we're all
[1:46:23] in this together. There's no big eyes.
[1:46:25] There's no big You know what I We're
[1:46:27] we're all we're all fighting [music]
[1:46:28] this fight of faith. We're all living in
[1:46:29] Lady OC in the most wicked age there
[1:46:31] ever was and seems like the devil's
[1:46:33] pressing on every every side and we make
[1:46:35] mistakes and and we go through hard
[1:46:37] times and and [music]
[1:46:38] we fall short. But you know what?
[1:46:40] There's grace.
[1:46:42] Where sin abound, grace did much more
[1:46:44] abound. [music] Hey, we'll just start
[1:46:47] singing this song and just see how the
[1:46:49] Lord will deal with our hearts. Help me
[1:46:51] sing it. [snorts]
[1:46:58] Freedom is [singing] here.
[1:47:01] [music]
[1:47:02] Hallelujah.

[1:57:20] in this life.
[1:57:25] We've [singing and music]

[1:58:24] We've been made [music] victorious
[1:58:28] [singing]
[1:58:31] through the blood of Jesus [music]
[1:58:35] Christ. [singing]
[1:58:38] Amen. Did you enjoy [music] that? Let's
[1:58:41] give the Lord a hand.
[1:58:43] [applause]
[1:58:44] [music]
[1:58:46] I really, really enjoyed that was
[1:58:49] evidence of salvation. The funny thing
[1:58:51] about evidence, you know, I don't know
[1:58:53] how many cases I've had in court over
[1:58:55] the years, but I never took a case into
[1:58:56] [music] court that I didn't have
[1:58:57] evidence on. Evidence is proof.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; It's proof that something happened. And
[1:59:03] I always wondered, you know, why why God
[1:59:04] let a mortal like John [music]
[1:59:07] go up and see the lamb on the throne,
[1:59:10] the slain lamb. It's the only human
[1:59:13] being on the face of the earth at that
[1:59:15] time that saw with his own eyes [music]
[1:59:18] the evidence that salvation had been
[1:59:21] obtained.
[1:59:23] [music]
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; He had to come back and tell you and me
[1:59:26] there's proof.
[1:59:28] Anything that's allowed in court without
[1:59:31] evidence is considered hearsay. The
[1:59:33] judge can't look at it. The judge won't
[1:59:35] look at it cuz it's [music] hearsay. It
[1:59:38] could be a lie.
[1:59:40] And when Satan looks at your life, you
[1:59:42] look at your life. I don't know how many
[1:59:43] times I've I've had the young some young
[1:59:45] people come to me and brother Rob go to
[1:59:47] him as well. You know, want the Holy
[1:59:49] Ghost. I, you know, I feel like I got it
[1:59:50] and and then, you know, I've go through
[1:59:52] these things.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; The thing about getting the Holy Ghost,
[1:59:55] the evidence of the Holy Ghost, all them
[1:59:56] battles that you were fighting before
[1:59:58] you had the Holy Ghost, they did not
[2:00:00] leave.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; They didn't leave.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; They're still there.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; You know, if if what what if Job is
[2:00:08] sitting on this this ash heap, he's lost
[2:00:10] everything and and and he he's the
[2:00:12] evidence of of redemption. God, brother
[2:00:14] Brandham said he had revelation. What if
[2:00:16] he never got it? [music]
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; If he never got it, he would have rotted
[2:00:21] on that ash heap. But God gave him
[2:00:23] evidence.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; This is this is what God's trying to do
[2:00:26] to you tonight.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Let's tell you, it's not about the
[2:00:29] battle. When when when the children of
[2:00:31] Israel
[2:00:33] crossed into the promised land, Brother
[2:00:34] Brandham said the promised land was a
[2:00:36] type of the Holy Ghost.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; But all them giants didn't automatically
[2:00:41] just disappear and leave. When they
[2:00:42] crossed Jordan and went to the promised
[2:00:44] land, what them giants do? They came for
[2:00:46] them.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; But Paul tells us in Ephesians, God gave
[2:00:50] you an armor.
[2:00:52] He gave you an armor.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; But the great thing about that armor,
[2:00:58] God armored you with a helmet of
[2:01:00] salvation,
[2:01:02] the shield of faith.
[2:01:04] He girded you with truth,
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; breastplate of righteousness, and give
[2:01:09] you the sword of the spirit. [music]
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; But he said, "Let me do the fighting."
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; That's true evidence.
[2:01:20] When you know that you have the evidence
[2:01:23] is when you you get the Holy Ghost and
[2:01:25] all them battles
[2:01:27] still lay there in front of you.
[2:01:29] You can do like Job said, still on his
[2:01:32] ash heap.
[2:01:34] I know he is God.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; And he can do all things.
[2:01:40] [music]
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; You have a God that can do all things.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; Your battle might be bigger tomorrow.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; It might be worse.
[2:01:49] but with the Holy Ghost. As our brother
[2:01:52] was saying tonight, when you go face
[2:01:54] that giant, you can face him with joy.
[2:01:56] You can face him with peace with with
[2:01:57] with with everything that comes with it,
[2:02:00] you're an heir to it. [music]
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; But there, can we sing that song? If if
[2:02:06] not for grace, I don't know how it
[2:02:07] starts. Where would I be? Let's sing
[2:02:09] this and then we'll go. Just remember
[2:02:12] the sisters have made sandwiches and
[2:02:14] snacks next door.
[2:02:17] And uh youth, you're welcome to to come
[2:02:19] over there and fellowship. [music] Um
[2:02:23] some of the brothers, I think we're
[2:02:24] going to set up some tables. So, if you
[2:02:26] wouldn't mind helping us do that. Let's
[2:02:28] worship him a minute.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; You only [singing] know.
[2:02:46] [music] I'm glad you see
[2:02:50] [singing] through eyes of love.
[2:02:55] A hopeless case,
[2:02:59] an empty [music and singing] space.
[2:03:03] If not for grace,

[2:03:11] You only know. [singing]
