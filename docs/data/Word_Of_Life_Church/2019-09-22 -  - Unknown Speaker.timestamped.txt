[3:37] in church tonight we had a great time
[3:40] last night with the youth that they at
[3:41] the youth banquet I'm sure the young
[3:44] people appreciate the work that went
[3:45] into that last night that was a it was
[3:48] decorated beautiful brother Aaron
[3:49] Guillory done a ton of work that ladies
[3:51] did a lot of work it was really nice
[3:53] brother David did a just a wonderful job
[3:56] with the sermon it was a it was a good
[3:58] atmosphere and they're just a really
[3:59] nice thing for the young people and he's
[4:01] with us here tonight so looking forward
[4:04] to that know the Lord we'll have
[4:05] something good for us we've got several
[4:07] prayer requests tonight we'll just take
[4:10] these to the Lord I'm going to ask
[4:11] brother Keith if you don't mind to come
[4:13] just share these with you please
[4:15] remember brother Mark Powell several of
[4:17] you I'm sure a member used to attend
[4:19] church here's had to move for a job
[4:21] situation working a lot of late shift
[4:23] not being able to be in church to assess
[4:25] the Lord to intervene they're getting
[4:27] discouraged and unspoken prayer requests
[4:29] for brother James Turrell let's remember
[4:31] him brother Brandon Green would like for
[4:33] us to remember his boss and family and
[4:35] prayer his grandfather is in hospice
[4:37] care just asking the Lord for their
[4:40] salvation just for the entire family
[4:43] sister Marilyn Wiggins asked for prayer
[4:46] she got some reports from the doctor she
[4:49] just asked for healing and wisdom and
[4:50] peace to know what to do so let's
[4:52] certainly remember that we could stand
[4:54] and I swear the Keith comes
[5:02] I've a request I would like for y'all to
[5:05] help me pray about I was in the ER
[5:08] Thursday evening
[5:10] heart beating 150 times a minute it's
[5:12] called atrial fibrillation the top part
[5:14] of heart beats too fast and you have an
[5:16] increased risk of a stroke etc the
[5:19] doctor gave me some choices because it's
[5:21] happened a couple of times because of
[5:22] the chemo it caused my heart to the
[5:25] heart strong functionally but the
[5:26] electrical part is not so I don't know
[5:29] exactly how to proceed he offered me a
[5:31] pill every day plus blood thinner or a
[5:34] pill that I could take if it goes into
[5:36] bad rhythm just take it and it would put
[5:38] my heart back in rhythm but every time
[5:40] that happens it increases your chance of
[5:42] doing it again so anyways I don't want
[5:45] to take blood thinner I don't want to
[5:47] take the daily pill but what does he
[5:49] want so if you would cuz he said if we
[5:52] asked he would help us understand what
[5:54] to do cuz he gives us doctors he gives
[5:57] us dentist and all these things to help
[5:59] us so if you wouldn't mind pray with me
[6:01] that he would leave me in the direct way
[6:02] I'm healed
[6:03] I mean God will do it again he's done it
[6:07] once but sometimes he leads us in paths
[6:09] and we just want to go with him
[6:11] let's pray Heavenly Father we love you
[6:14] so much we're so very thankful to be in
[6:16] your house

[6:19] tell you what I believe we can have
[6:21] showers of blessings on the inside

[21:53] you think is great in your side every
[21:55] one of them are faulty and flawed he's
[21:58] the only one that is absolutely perfect
[22:01] aren't you glad your confidence is in
[22:03] him tonight god bless you so happy to be
[22:06] together tonight in the house of the
[22:07] Lord had a wonderful time last night in
[22:09] the banquet certainly once appreciate
[22:11] all those that put forth all the effort
[22:13] to make that possible for our young
[22:15] people brother David did a great job and
[22:17] speaking the singing and all of that
[22:20] together so appreciate it from most of
[22:23] you dolt that were not there it was
[22:25] rooted in us and real blessing not for
[22:28] us to give all of those that did all
[22:29] that if we could just and I say anything
[22:40] where's the lawyer how many has a major
[22:43] tonight or more than one maybe multiple
[22:46] we believe they're serving a god to nine
[22:48] it is so mindful of our needs more than
[22:52] likely the Avenue by which our needs
[22:55] will be supplied is through the eyes of
[22:58] our heart when our eyes and a heart
[23:01] become open to understand maybe not just
[23:05] necessarily what I need is but know that
[23:09] he who understands I need as the
[23:11] sufficiency to be able to take care of
[23:13] him
[23:14] sometimes he says yes sometimes she says
[23:16] no sometimes he says wait a while but
[23:20] whenever he does if we believe he's
[23:22] sovereign and he's in control then we
[23:25] know that his his desire is for our good
[23:29] you believe that
[23:30] remember he loves you exactly the same
[23:35] way he loves the Lord Jesus would he
[23:40] ever hold anything from the Lord Jesus
[23:42] that was good for him can you ever stop
[23:46] eleven you know thou lovest them as thou
[23:50] lovest me and thou lovest me from before
[23:53] the foundation of the world that had
[23:57] nothing to do with you that doesn't it
[24:01] was your choice that doesn't do with how
[24:03] good you are and I'll flip it around
[24:06] that doesn't do that bad you were here
[24:08] it had to do with him choosing us in
[24:11] himself open the eyes of my heart Lord
[24:16] was singing together shall we
[24:18] when I spread the David to come and just
[24:20] bring to us to not what the Lord is
[24:22] placed upon his heart it's a great night
[24:24] to be together in it
[24:25] [Music]

[24:34] have made of

[27:41] because we was blind one day but Jesus
[27:45] opened our eyes let's just buy our
[27:48] hearts if you win Lord we want to thank
[27:51] you tonight for vision to be able to see
[27:55] not just naturally but to be able to see
[27:58] spiritual things in your word we know
[28:01] Lord that you told us when you was here
[28:03] that you hid things from the eyes of the
[28:06] wise and the prudent but you revealed
[28:09] them unto babes and Lord that's why we
[28:12] want to be we want to be as children
[28:14] that whatever you would say them Lord we
[28:17] could take it to heart or we wouldn't
[28:19] have to take and meditate it and wonder
[28:21] if it's right and wondering how it's all
[28:23] going to work we want to be like little
[28:24] children that whenever the father the
[28:27] mother would say something they would
[28:29] simply believe them because they always
[28:31] told them the truth Lord you've never
[28:34] lied in lying isn't I even in your
[28:36] character you've given us great truth in
[28:39] this day you've sent us this great
[28:41] endtime message Lord and you have opened
[28:44] our eyes to be able to see it and for
[28:46] that we are so thankful tonight father
[28:48] well yes Lord for these next few moments
[28:50] a time that you would just come now help
[28:53] us Lord as we look into your word that
[28:55] you would just take it Lord break it to
[28:57] our hearts Lord that we could have
[28:59] understanding we pray while we ask that
[29:02] you would just come and charge the
[29:04] atmosphere that's here in this place
[29:06] tonight Lord that we can look into the
[29:08] things Lord that has great value to the
[29:11] heart of Uri lay and we ask that Lord
[29:14] that you'd help me to be able to step
[29:15] aside Lord that you can just use this
[29:18] Lord I'm aware Lord of my ability lord
[29:20] it's so small but my confidence isn't in
[29:23] man my confidence is in you and this
[29:26] congregation Lord they've come to hear
[29:28] something from your word tonight and I
[29:30] pray Lord that you would help us in
[29:32] Jesus name and everybody said
[29:35] a man god bless you we greet you in the
[29:37] name of Lord Psalms 102 verse 13
[29:40] certainly good to be here this weekend
[29:42] with you in the house the Lord and just
[29:43] under anticipation for what the Lord is
[29:46] going to say you believe you'll speak to
[29:47] us amen
[29:49] he never disappoints Psalms 102 verse 13
[29:55] thou shall arise and have mercy upon
[29:58] Zion for the time to favor her yay the
[30:03] set time has come for thy servants take
[30:06] pleasure in her stones and favored the
[30:09] dust thereof so the heathen shall fear
[30:13] the name of the Lord and all the kings
[30:15] of the earth thy glory when the Lord
[30:19] shall build up Zion he shall appear in
[30:23] his glory he will regard the prayer of
[30:27] the destitute and not despise their
[30:30] prayer this shall be written for the
[30:32] generation to come and the people which
[30:35] shall be created shall praise the Lord
[30:40] so he's going to appear in glory he
[30:42] shall appear and he's also going to
[30:44] create a people nurse shall praise him
[30:46] for he hath looked down from the height
[30:49] of his sanctuary from heaven did the
[30:53] Lord behold the earth to hear the
[30:56] groaning of the prisoner and to loose
[30:59] those that are appointed to death I'd
[31:04] like to speak to you tonight on loose
[31:05] from the house of your bondsman may the
[31:10] Lord has blessings for the word you can
[31:12] be seated tonight we appreciate the
[31:15] opportunity to be here with you in the
[31:17] service and the house of the Lord we
[31:21] know by looking at the Old Testament
[31:24] that the Old Testament would be a shadow
[31:28] or a type of what God's going to do for
[31:32] us in the New Testament the Prophet
[31:34] would say that if you see the shadow
[31:36] you'd have a pretty good understanding
[31:37] by looking at the shadow of what's
[31:40] actually coming in reality and we know
[31:43] that within God of course we know was
[31:46] all these
[31:47] attributes that was within his being of
[31:50] course the attribute of being a healer
[31:52] and then attribute of being a deliverer
[31:54] Savior Redeemer all those things that
[31:57] laid within our God we know that God
[32:00] would actually through shadow and
[32:02] through time he would take and begin to
[32:04] unveil the mystery of his attributes
[32:07] that laid within him down through time
[32:10] even through the shadow of the old
[32:12] testament and we know that corss God
[32:15] would unfold himself that God would
[32:17] reveal himself by the characteristics of
[32:19] what his name is and we realized that
[32:22] God who of course would have never he
[32:25] would have never allowed sin to be able
[32:26] to come in he would have never allowed
[32:28] sickness to be able to come in he'd
[32:30] never allowed unbelief to be able to
[32:32] take place had he not had a way to be
[32:35] able to redeem back every one of his
[32:38] children that would come underneath it
[32:40] so before actually there was ever a time
[32:43] that men would fall that yet within
[32:46] God's mind he had already had a way by
[32:48] attribute to be able to bring back his
[32:51] sons and we know that God of course is a
[32:53] great Redeemer you believe that he is
[32:55] not only Redeemer but we know that our
[32:57] God is a restorer and not only is he
[33:00] restore but we know that we returns down
[33:02] to the Old Testament that God would give
[33:04] us glimpses of his mercy glimpses of his
[33:07] love and how that he would betray
[33:09] himself and he would begin to show grace
[33:12] and actually many times that he would
[33:14] show favor and many times the favor that
[33:17] he would show would be things that is
[33:19] unmerited they really didn't deserve it
[33:21] but yet God would have to show mercy
[33:23] they really didn't earn it but yet God
[33:26] would show mercy to them and we know
[33:28] that he would of course show this
[33:30] unmerited favor unto his children even
[33:33] from the very beginning whenever the
[33:36] garden was put there and how that God of
[33:38] course I had seen that when the woman
[33:40] had failed and that saying had came in
[33:42] and we know that course that there was
[33:44] something that was laying within Adam
[33:46] that God would bring out a
[33:48] characteristic within Adam that Adam
[33:50] would not leave her in this fallen state
[33:53] but Adam of course being made in the
[33:56] image of God being made in the likeness
[33:57] of God that
[33:59] of course wouldn't leave her like that
[34:01] but you realize something calls to Adam
[34:03] to stand for his wife and even though
[34:06] she was in a faulted condition Adam of
[34:09] course would stand beside her and we see
[34:12] it's a display of favor it's an act of
[34:15] love it's an act of mercy and not only
[34:18] an adamant of course Adam was only
[34:21] reflecting God how that God of course
[34:23] would reveal his attributes of mercy
[34:26] even from the beginning he would show
[34:28] His redemptive attributes when it would
[34:29] come to his children he would actually
[34:32] express this kind of Allah and we see
[34:35] how they God would would come down into
[34:37] the garden as the puppets say they would
[34:39] be there in the evening time as they
[34:41] would come together to be able to
[34:42] fellowship with one another but this
[34:44] evening is different than most evenings
[34:45] Adam does not show up at the place of
[34:48] that's been provided to worship the
[34:50] woman does not show up in the place
[34:52] that's been provided to worship so God
[34:54] of course the Bible would tell us that
[34:56] God he would actually begin to run he
[34:59] would run through the garden screaming
[35:01] out Adam or art thou in that something
[35:05] that God would come down he would come
[35:08] down into the garden and express
[35:11] attributes he would come running through
[35:13] the garden looking behind the trees as
[35:16] it was looking behind the rocks he's
[35:18] running through the garden and he's
[35:20] hollering out Adam or art thou and the
[35:23] puffy would say it like this and in the
[35:25] inner Vail he said notice it's nothing
[35:27] that you do or what you can do it's what
[35:30] God notice it's what God's done for you
[35:32] in Christ and no man never sought God no
[35:36] man never sought God man don't seek God
[35:40] God seeks man the very beginning in the
[35:43] Garden of Eden it proved it now watch
[35:45] God's going to start this from the very
[35:47] beginning he's going to prove that man
[35:50] does not seek after God but that God
[35:52] comes running after man and he tells us
[35:55] that from the very beginning he proved
[35:57] it that Adam Adam ought to have been
[36:00] running through the garden whoring
[36:02] father father were art thou but it was
[36:05] God that was running through the Garden
[36:07] of Eden saying
[36:09] Adam over art thou think of that big God
[36:12] was searching for something even though
[36:15] we would say well Adam was lost wall we
[36:18] looked at loss different than the way
[36:19] God looks at los alamos not lost as in
[36:23] Ana was completely out of each of God
[36:25] Adam was not at a reach of god but God
[36:28] come running down through the garden and
[36:30] he's searching for Adam he's looking for
[36:32] Adam in my he was screaming out but him
[36:35] says at one place he was screaming out
[36:37] Adam or art thou to think of that that
[36:41] in all-knowing God a God that knows the
[36:45] beginning to the end is running through
[36:48] the garden screaming Adam where art thou
[36:51] a God that knows about every flea that
[36:54] would everybody'd sigh God that would
[36:56] know everything that's about you he
[36:58] would know every animal he would be able
[37:01] to name the stars he'd be able to name
[37:03] every plant that there is but yet here
[37:05] God is in the garden and he's running
[37:07] and he's screaming out Adam where art
[37:10] thou God no Brad a wash he's an
[37:14] all-knowing God he knows exactly where
[37:16] Adam was God but ask in a deloria's
[37:19] because he didn't know that he's
[37:20] displaying attributes of mercy he's
[37:23] displaying attributes of redemption
[37:26] he's displaying attributes of love to
[37:28] give Adam of space to be able to repent
[37:31] and to come searching for him God went
[37:34] looking for him and Adam should have
[37:36] went looking for God but it was it to be
[37:38] because men don't seek God God seeks
[37:42] after man oh god know that and wasn't
[37:46] behind the bushes where he was looking
[37:48] at he knowed he wasn't behind the tree
[37:50] or behind the rock he knew where he was
[37:52] hiding that but God still yet was
[37:54] displaying some redemptive quality hey
[37:57] man be the light because Adam belong to
[38:00] God Adam was God's Son Adam belong to
[38:04] God God created Adam and God but I'm
[38:07] gonna give Adam to the devil and I'm
[38:10] gonna give you I said God
[38:12] gonna give you to the devil you're not
[38:15] the devil's property you don't belong to
[38:17] the devil you're God's attributes that
[38:19] he can reach down to where you're at we
[38:25] see how that when Adam stepped out of
[38:27] his position of sonship once he steps
[38:30] out of his place that there begins to be
[38:33] a pull upon the attribute of God but now
[38:36] the attribute can actually come to
[38:38] display and they become the
[38:40] manifestations we'd say the attribute
[38:42] has to be pulled on in order to send God
[38:46] into action on your behalf that
[38:48] attribute has to be pulled off you want
[38:51] to know him as healer you've got to pull
[38:53] upon that attribute of healer you want
[38:55] to know him as restored you've got to
[38:56] pull on that attribute to restore what
[38:59] if God do God killed a lamb God kill the
[39:05] lamb they've been amazing he didn't tell
[39:07] Adam you go kill your lamb why didn't he
[39:10] tell Adam to go find the lamb why didn't
[39:13] he tell him to go kill a lamb but notice
[39:16] Adam wasn't gonna provide this sacrifice
[39:19] but God was going to provide this
[39:22] sacrifice if God created everything in
[39:26] the garden - bye - bye - bye - then tell
[39:28] me where did that lamb come from you
[39:31] tell me where that lamb come from and
[39:33] I'll tell you where that RAM on the
[39:34] mountain with Abraham come from you tell
[39:37] me where that RAM on the mountain with
[39:38] Abraham come from and you tell me where
[39:40] those squirrels and the trees that day
[39:42] Kentucky come from our God is a creator
[39:45] and he was going to create a body to be
[39:49] able to show rediff - worked all of
[39:52] mankind he's telling you oh my can
[39:57] imagine when he wraps those skins around
[39:59] his children God's letting them know
[40:02] this is your way back this is how you
[40:05] come back it's because they're God's
[40:07] children they're God's people even when
[40:11] it come to Israel Israel did not choose
[40:13] Jehovah to be their God
[40:16] and you did not choose cross but Jesus
[40:19] Christ chose you st. John 15:16 you've
[40:23] not chosen me but I've chosen you that
[40:25] you're damned that you should go forth
[40:27] and bring forth fruit so truly God chose
[40:31] Israel and God's the one that made the
[40:35] covenant with Israel now there's many of
[40:39] nations that God could have chose that's
[40:41] true there was a meaning that God could
[40:43] have chose besides Israel but I want to
[40:46] tell you there was nations that was a
[40:47] minimum number that God could have chose
[40:49] there was those as we would say that
[40:51] would have been oh my there was a better
[40:53] farmers that could bring forth better
[40:55] crops there was those people that was
[40:57] better and better educated than what
[40:59] they was there was those that was made
[41:01] of a of a higher advanced civilization
[41:03] but God looked beyond numbers God look
[41:08] beyond culture God look beyond
[41:10] civilization or hallelujah God look
[41:13] beyond education God don't save a man
[41:17] because he's smart
[41:18] God don't save a man because he's
[41:21] similar God saves a man because he
[41:23] purchased him back him by his blood he
[41:25] comes hurry Dean back sons God moves by
[41:32] the promise of his word and God looked
[41:34] at his word all friends don't you see
[41:36] God cannot bypass his word I said he
[41:41] cannot bypass his word Israel with God's
[41:44] people Israel being blessed it's not
[41:49] what Israel did for themselves it's what
[41:51] God done for them it is Rabine holy it's
[41:55] not what they did within themselves it's
[41:56] what God blessed them by if they're
[41:58] redeemed it's what God did for them
[42:01] notice indeed romani 7/6 that the
[42:05] scripture says for thou art a holy
[42:07] people that means set apart you're
[42:08] separated so God tells Israel you're a
[42:12] separated people you're separated into
[42:15] the LORD thy God and the Lord thy God
[42:17] have chosen thee he's chosen thee to be
[42:21] a special people unto himself above all
[42:25] the people that are upon the face of the
[42:28] earth God chose
[42:30] these people they're gonna be a holy
[42:33] people now they don't mean they're gonna
[42:36] be without false
[42:38] they don't mean they're gonna be without
[42:41] mistakes they don't mean they're gonna
[42:43] make every decision right we know they
[42:45] didn't come up but I want to tell you
[42:47] it's beyond what man sees listen this
[42:51] ain't them calling themselves holy this
[42:53] is God : he's speaking by the utterance
[42:56] of his word and God's telling him you
[42:58] are holy Deuteronomy 7 and 7 the Lord
[43:05] did not set his love upon you nor choose
[43:09] you because you were more in number than
[43:11] any people for you're the fewest of all
[43:13] the people but because the Lord loves
[43:19] you hallelujah the Lord loves you notice
[43:24] he said because he would keep the oath
[43:26] he has love has been given by an oath
[43:29] and God must keep his word he would keep
[43:34] the oath which he had sworn unto your
[43:36] father's that the Lord brought you all
[43:38] this of this has the Lord brought you
[43:40] out with a mighty hand and he redeems
[43:43] you he redeems you out of the house of
[43:47] the bondsman he redeems you out of the
[43:51] house of the bondsman notice how the
[43:53] house of the bondsman from the hand of
[43:56] Pharaoh king of sin
[43:59] [Applause]
[44:02] he redeemed you out of the house of the
[44:05] bondsman out of the king of all sin
[44:08] that's where he got you at he was
[44:11] blacked out in sin but I want to tell
[44:13] you God tell her you is that and he
[44:15] loosed you from the house of that puzzle
[44:20] notice the principle of this Lucy is
[44:23] that God which gives his oath and what
[44:27] God would give his oath he is now
[44:29] required because he must keep his word
[44:35] he would loose his people with a mighty
[44:38] hand so then it's the oaths of God the
[44:43] very spoken word of God God would use
[44:46] his word and he's bound to his word that
[44:50] he would loose his people because he
[44:53] loved them he loved them now this word
[44:58] love here it literally means covenant
[45:01] love it means marital love or what we
[45:07] call elective love now if it's st. John
[45:13] 3:16 for God so loved the world that's
[45:17] not married to love that's Paul's mouth
[45:21] love that's just like if I had a piece
[45:24] of candy in my hair and I could take us
[45:26] for God so loved the world I could give
[45:28] that to every person that's in this
[45:29] building but when you talk about
[45:31] elective love you take that one piece
[45:34] and you give it to one individual and
[45:37] you're showing favor to that one
[45:39] individual and let me tell that's the
[45:41] way God chose you he come to her you as
[45:44] a he found you in the house of that
[45:46] bondsman
[45:47] I showed you his love - normally 14-day
[45:57] for down - holy people the LORD thy God
[45:59] and the Lord has chosen thee to be a
[46:02] peculiar people they don't mean strange
[46:07] that only not that means a treasured
[46:12] people hallelujah hallelujah
[46:19] thou art a treasure he scene value in
[46:23] you I'm gonna setting in he seemed value
[46:27] in that you know God looks within his
[46:32] people and he said he's chosen thee
[46:34] because you are a peculiar treasure and
[46:36] himself above all the denominations that
[46:40] are upon the earth and the Lord has a
[46:46] vouched he's a vouched thee this day to
[46:50] be his treasured people as he promised
[46:53] thee that thou should us keep all of his
[46:56] Commandments look at this word of
[46:58] vouched it means arm art to speak to
[47:00] utter to say in one's heart to think to
[47:04] command to promise to intend to be said
[47:07] to be called to make a vow by speaking
[47:11] the Lord has made a vow by speaking he
[47:16] has a vows so God's Word is over his
[47:19] people
[47:21] now notice his words not based upon how
[47:24] good you are
[47:25] come on it's not based upon merits of
[47:28] Deeds and merits of her but he advanced
[47:30] he spoke his word over you and listen
[47:33] it's his word that holds you he spoke
[47:37] his word of risk of people and he
[47:39] commanded and said you are mines first
[47:45] night cleaning to make the high above
[47:48] all nations which he had made in praise
[47:51] he made you in praise he didn't want you
[47:56] to be a bunch of grouch he want a bunch
[47:59] of sad face people he made you to be a
[48:01] people in praise and he named that thou
[48:09] may us be a holy people and to the LORD
[48:12] thy God what's the amount as he hath
[48:15] spoken because he spoke his word over
[48:19] them you're a high above all nations
[48:22] because of the spoken word because of
[48:26] his spoken word you'll receive
[48:28] preferential treatment you receive favor
[48:32] from God because his Lord has a vouched
[48:35] to you isaiah says it like this
[48:41] thou who not taken from the ends of the
[48:43] earth and i'd called me to be a chief of
[48:45] me in thereof and said unto thee thou
[48:48] art my servant what's this part I have
[48:50] chosen thee and not cast thee away it
[48:57] ain't that they haven't give him reason
[49:00] come on somebody it's not because they
[49:03] weren't perfect and they want pol it and
[49:05] they never do nothin wrong it's because
[49:07] his word is over the earth and because
[49:11] his word is over the earth he simply
[49:13] cannot cast them away as though they
[49:15] don't belong to him he's tell him I
[49:20] can't throw you away I can't cast you
[49:23] away why because my love is a vast
[49:26] hallelujah which means she's chosen he
[49:29] sets his word upon her and he can't
[49:31] change his mind of
[49:33] his word as their 4301 but now the set
[49:40] the Lord that created thee Oh Jacob he
[49:43] that formed thee O Israel fear not for I
[49:48] have redeemed thee I have called thee by
[49:50] thy name thou art mine
[49:55] so there not here's my chance come on
[49:59] they're not there just by coincidence he
[50:02] created this people he formed this
[50:05] people and he redeemed you he loosed you
[50:08] because he called you by name hallelujah
[50:15] whenever she would fall when she would
[50:19] become disobedient to God's Word when
[50:23] she started looking at these other gods
[50:26] God simply cannot just forget about her
[50:29] and she did she went the horn that's
[50:33] other gods but God cannot forget about
[50:36] her so what's he gonna do they start
[50:40] pulling upon those attributes within him
[50:42] and he would display attributes of mercy
[50:45] they didn't deserve it
[50:47] but mercy ain't something you deserved
[50:50] he would show favor let me say this
[50:53] there's nothing that can stop our God
[50:56] our God will run after his people God I
[51:02] ran after Adam the father ran after the
[51:06] prodigal son come on in so much it would
[51:10] almost look like the very love of God is
[51:13] reckless
[51:17] it wouldn't look like God's love it's so
[51:20] reckless
[51:21] it looks like he would just allow
[51:23] anything and anything goes and whatever
[51:26] happens let me tell you something
[51:27] friends
[51:28] it looks like God's love is reckless but
[51:31] I want to tell you it's a left of lunch
[51:33] and he cannot forget about who he
[51:36] created I want to tell you here's a love
[51:41] will chase you down I believe that
[51:43] tonight
[51:43] there ain't no shadows as a songwriter
[51:46] said there ain't no shadow he won't
[51:47] light up there's no mountains he won't
[51:49] climb up there's all he's coming to get
[51:51] you hallelujah there ain't no whoa he
[51:55] won't kick down there ain't no life he
[51:57] won't tear down there ain't no seal he
[52:00] won't tread down he's coming after you
[52:03] there ain't no place so dark hallelujah
[52:06] there ain't no place so dark that God's
[52:08] hand can't reach down and be able to
[52:10] pick you up how the muck in the Mar this
[52:13] world nothing can stop our God
[52:15] I said nothing can stop our God
[52:22] there ain't no condition so bad there
[52:26] ain't no drug habit so bad there ain't
[52:28] no alcoholism so bad that our God's hand
[52:31] can't reach right down into the Mara
[52:33] that unbelief and pull them back to
[52:35] where they're supposed to be sin can't
[52:42] get that black that God can't get to him
[52:44] he's a vouched he's a vouch for his
[52:48] children
[52:51] it would almost look reckless how much
[52:54] he loves her that he would display
[52:57] within the scripture that he would tell
[53:00] a prophet I want you to go marry a woman
[53:04] of the Hoarders sounds reckless still it
[53:11] sounds reckless but God's love would
[53:15] actually favor a prophet and tell him go
[53:18] take a woman of the whoredoms and Hosea
[53:23] being obedient
[53:24] Hosea I want to turn the Lord Senator
[53:26] Hosea don't take into the a wife of the
[53:29] whoredoms and the children of Hoarders
[53:32] that shouldn't offend you that God can
[53:38] take children's out of whoredoms that
[53:46] shouldn't offends you that God can take
[53:47] children as denominations that shouldn't
[53:51] offends you that God's reach can reach
[53:53] right there and talk and follow sysm
[53:55] right down in the Catholic come on its
[53:58] end offends you that God can take and
[54:00] bring his children right out from a
[54:02] monster's whoredoms for the Lord had
[54:08] committed great whoredom the land it
[54:10] would committed great whoredom departing
[54:12] from the Lord so he went and took go
[54:14] home or the daughter knobbly of notice
[54:15] this woman did not go looking for Hosea
[54:19] come on but notice this woman she wasn't
[54:22] trying to find him oh no Hosea was been
[54:25] a vouched by God's Word and so the world
[54:28] said Hosea looking for this woman
[54:31] if Hosea being obedient to God oh my
[54:34] he's displaying something within his
[54:36] life so Hosea finds this woman he
[54:39] marries this woman he loves this woman
[54:41] he cares about this one what's Hosea do
[54:43] it he's reflecting Almighty God
[54:46] [Applause]
[54:49] you thank God quit loving is or when she
[54:52] went down into whoredoms there ain't no
[54:56] sin that can stop God's love it almost
[54:59] looks reckless come on oh my for a while
[55:04] while they're married everything seems
[55:06] good everything seems fine he pride
[55:09] provides for her oh my he takes care of
[55:11] her but some of those old paramours
[55:15] some of her old lovers got to coming
[55:19] back around and pulling on this woman
[55:23] some of them old ladder started coming
[55:25] back around and all my she found herself
[55:27] in the arms of her old paramours now let
[55:33] me tell you about this one she had no
[55:35] intention of going back to hosea she has
[55:38] no intent listen she ain't come running
[55:41] back to him saying forgive me I'd done
[55:43] wrong let's make this work that's not
[55:45] what she's doing but Hosea we're running
[55:50] after her why God's display the
[55:54] attributes of his love within Hosea by
[55:57] looking for this woman what has she done
[56:03] to married him to do this what has she
[56:06] done to deserve him to come looking for
[56:08] her she ain't done one thing this made
[56:13] her a recognizes she's wrong and decided
[56:15] to come back to God this isn't her
[56:17] trying to work things out come out this
[56:19] is Hosea he went down to where she was I
[56:22] said he found her and he got her out of
[56:25] the lap of her paramours he found her
[56:31] with her lovers and he called her out of
[56:34] the house of whoredoms
[56:37] [Music]
[56:38] and neither did you try to work things
[56:41] out with Jesus you never sought after
[56:44] God come on we was out in the world
[56:47] living in the pleasures of the world
[56:48] after he left the world walking last the
[56:50] world
[56:50] Jeffster laughter we was in the arms of
[56:53] the paramours of Laodicea come on church
[56:58] he found you living in sin who looks
[57:04] like this is reckless Hosea it looks
[57:06] reckless that you would do this God's
[57:08] just expressing attributes notice the
[57:13] Bible says in Hosea 2:14
[57:15] so therefore behold I will lure her I
[57:19] will over her and bring her to the
[57:26] wilderness and speak comfortably to her
[57:31] she ain't trying to find him I'm gonna
[57:36] bring her and I notice he's going to
[57:38] bring her out he's going to carry her
[57:43] out you talking about grace you talking
[57:46] about God's love you talking about God's
[57:49] mercy he's bringing this parallel for
[57:53] what God had done for Israel is now what
[57:55] this prophet is doing for this woman for
[57:58] God brought them out of the house of the
[58:00] bondsmen of Israel and now here is this
[58:03] prophet a man hears a prophet carrying
[58:06] her out of the house of her paramours
[58:08] taking a rat from the arms of her
[58:11] lover's he called Egypt out of sin into
[58:16] the wilderness the first Exodus he
[58:19] called them out here in the 3rd Exodus
[58:21] he's calling the bride out of the church
[58:26] watch he called Abraham and a Babylon
[58:30] and singing to the wilderness he called
[58:34] Israel out of sin and he led them to the
[58:37] wilderness and now he has to lure the
[58:40] church away from those old Paramore so
[58:42] it might look reckless that God would go
[58:44] looking among that system to find it but
[58:47] I want to tell you God's got some
[58:49] children down there he had some people
[58:52] down there people that he created people
[58:54] that he for they his love can I cast
[58:56] aside and do away with us
[59:00] he went searching for her hallelujah and
[59:04] he went searching for you and I so he
[59:08] goes beyond the camp just for her and he
[59:14] tells her I'm gonna lure you out here
[59:16] until the wilderness and when I get you
[59:17] to the wilderness I'm going to speak
[59:19] comfortably to you so he's not just
[59:22] gonna give her the written word but I'm
[59:26] gonna speak comfortably to her so she's
[59:31] gonna have more than just written she's
[59:34] gonna have spoken words a living voice
[59:38] from a living man to a living group
[59:44] she's gonna hear that original seed
[59:47] hallelujah right from the mouth of hosea
[59:50] the prophet notice his terminology speak
[59:56] comfortably it literally means to speak
[59:59] to the one's heart hallelujah he's
[1:00:05] speaking to the heart it means to speak
[1:00:09] comfortably means to change your heart
[1:00:12] from a time of mourning to a time of joy
[1:00:20] notice he's not speaking to her eyes
[1:00:23] he's not speaking to her head he
[1:00:26] speaking to her heart
[1:00:27] Malekith or didn't come to turn your
[1:00:30] head back so he speaks tenderly to the
[1:00:33] heart of this woman hallelujah
[1:00:35] and he's taking and transforming her
[1:00:37] thinking he's transforming her mind from
[1:00:40] a time of mourning from a time of dread
[1:00:42] and he changes her mind to a talent
[1:00:44] rejoicing he's referring to in Israel
[1:00:50] could be taken into captivity and it's
[1:00:53] those as though she's asleep and she's
[1:00:56] slumbering and she's in captivity she
[1:00:59] shackled up she's in a miserable
[1:01:01] condition
[1:01:02] her heart is mourning because of the
[1:01:04] condition that her body's in notice what

[1:03:18] become so whisper or they couldn't even
[1:03:20] hardly speak well they couldn't even
[1:03:23] hardly talk wearing that old shackle
[1:03:25] around their neck and that's what Satan
[1:03:27] wants to do with the Church of God
[1:03:29] that's what Satan wants to do with the
[1:03:31] minister in this hour he wants to put a
[1:03:33] shackle around their neck they're trying
[1:03:35] to quieten the voice but I want to tell
[1:03:37] you the spirit and the bride say come
[1:03:40] which tells me that God has unloosed us
[1:03:43] from the house of our buzz' we refuse to

[1:03:58] it's letting her know you gotta cast
[1:04:01] aside and you're being loosed from the
[1:04:03] chains of your paramours Isaiah would go

[1:04:10] you were so for nothing he shall be
[1:04:13] redeemed you shall be redeemed without
[1:04:17] money
[1:04:18] how is that gonna be redeemed by the
[1:04:19] blood of Jesus Christ for thus saith the
[1:04:23] Lord God my people went down first with
[1:04:26] some of this they went down first into
[1:04:28] Egypt to sojourn there my people did my
[1:04:34] people did and many years later their
[1:04:37] Syrians oppressed them for nothing
[1:04:39] now I've delivered you from both Egypt
[1:04:42] and Assyria you'll remember that's where
[1:04:45] the sin was so great before the eyes of
[1:04:47] God and God tells them just like the sin
[1:04:50] was done in Egypt just like it was in
[1:04:52] Syria what Ben can prevent me from
[1:04:55] delivering you at a Babylon laughs I
[1:05:02] feel like running around this ability
[1:05:04] can I ask you tonight what devil can
[1:05:08] stop our God
[1:05:10] what Idol can stop our God what seeing
[1:05:14] what sickness
[1:05:15] what strand of unbelief can stop our God
[1:05:18] from delivering us from the house of the
[1:05:21] bondsman tonight butter if a Babylon
[1:05:24] couldn't stop them if Egypt pen star
[1:05:27] feel if Assyria couldn't stop you there
[1:05:29] any nobody can stop them you'll remember
[1:05:34] Egypt had the greatest military on earth
[1:05:36] during that time but God sent one man
[1:05:39] hallelujah I guess the whole army and
[1:05:41] the whole army could not stop one man
[1:05:44] [Applause]
[1:05:48] rise from the dust come to your place
[1:05:51] come to your position so Jose is going
[1:05:55] to lure Merl a he must bring her out of
[1:06:00] the house of her lover's brings her
[1:06:03] outside confusion brings her outside
[1:06:07] unbelief it brings her away so she can't
[1:06:12] focus on nothing else but him and him
[1:06:15] alone you don't want us focusing on
[1:06:22] nothing else but him and him alone you
[1:06:25] know what you look at you looking at him
[1:06:27] with one eye and look at your paramour
[1:06:29] so Laodicea with the other eye that
[1:06:31] somebody wants he wants us to come out
[1:06:33] into the wilderness away God did not
[1:06:39] leave us in our sin he did not leave us
[1:06:42] in our belief but he alerted us away let
[1:06:45] me tell you this sin was committed and
[1:06:49] God cannot simply overlook sin it must
[1:06:52] be dealt with come on I said it must be
[1:06:56] dealt with once he makes a mandate of
[1:07:00] his law the law being holy there had to
[1:07:05] be something that would answer the
[1:07:07] question of that law that was held
[1:07:10] against them now she's done wrong
[1:07:12] Israel's done wrong Hosea's bride done
[1:07:15] wrong she committed acts she's condemned
[1:07:18] by the law listen friends we're not
[1:07:19] trying to get around it we was guilty
[1:07:22] and God simply cannot overlook his words
[1:07:27] so it must be dealt with
[1:07:29] how is he going to do this something has
[1:07:32] got to lose her and redeem her to bring
[1:07:36] her back from the law I said something's
[1:07:39] got to redeem her he must restore the
[1:07:42] fellowship hallelujah Hosea can not
[1:07:46] touch it until she gets restored back to
[1:07:50] what she fell from
[1:07:52] now remember Isaiah had RA prophesied
[1:07:55] over Israel concerning their Redemption
[1:07:57] so she's held by prophecy she's held by
[1:07:59] God's Word it's prophetic utterance that
[1:08:02] has being held over her and Isaiah says
[1:08:05] in the amplified for your husband is
[1:08:07] your maker the Lord of Hosts is his name
[1:08:10] your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel
[1:08:13] who has called who is called the god of
[1:08:15] the whole earth for the Lord has called
[1:08:18] you like a wife who has been abandoned
[1:08:22] and grieved in the spirit a lot of life
[1:08:25] married in her youth but she was later
[1:08:27] rejected and scorned says your God so
[1:08:29] like a wife that has been abandoned and
[1:08:34] because she had been abandoned by her
[1:08:36] own reason by her own mistakes it brings
[1:08:40] grief that's what sin does sin brings
[1:08:43] guilt come on
[1:08:45] sin brings grief sin brings condemnation
[1:08:48] but if there is no sin there is no guilt
[1:08:53] if there is no sin there is no
[1:08:56] condemnation Israel sin has caused them
[1:09:04] to be separated it's caused them to be
[1:09:08] set apart from him because of their
[1:09:10] perverseness because of their depravity
[1:09:13] that they've caused by these other
[1:09:15] lovers because of their unbelief they
[1:09:18] caused themselves to be locked up in
[1:09:20] these houses she feels abandoned but God
[1:09:25] didn't leave her she left God a woman
[1:09:32] who was married in her youth he speaking
[1:09:34] of immaturity she was in a state of
[1:09:37] immaturity and in her immaturity she ran
[1:09:41] after these other lovers because of her
[1:09:43] immaturity
[1:09:44] she went into default because of her sin
[1:09:47] she feels this abandonment then Isaiah
[1:09:50] says this for a brief moment I abandoned
[1:09:54] you a brief moment I abandoned you but
[1:09:59] with great compassion
[1:10:02] come on he's referring to though the law
[1:10:05] judged us because the law condemned us
[1:10:08] come on
[1:10:09] it made us wrong but notice it's just
[1:10:11] for a brief moment notice the contrast
[1:10:13] the abandonment was brief but the mercy
[1:10:17] was great the abandonment was brief but
[1:10:21] the compassion hallelujah the passion
[1:10:24] that he would gather her awed by its
[1:10:27] great then he says in outbursts of Wrath
[1:10:30] I hid my face as it was just for a
[1:10:33] moment think about it as though he would
[1:10:35] just turn his face just for a moment he
[1:10:38] would look away he would look away just
[1:10:40] for a moment and that moment at times
[1:10:42] she felt grief and seeing it in and all
[1:10:45] the condemnation just for a moment he
[1:10:48] turns his face Oh
[1:10:51] but what everlasting kindness I will
[1:10:54] have compassion on you says the Lord
[1:10:56] your Redeemer God had to judge that sin
[1:11:05] and he did Judge it he judged it in the
[1:11:10] body of Jesus Christ and you should say
[1:11:14] amen to that
[1:11:15] because God's wrath fell upon our
[1:11:19] husband
[1:11:20] [Applause]
[1:11:24] why and he turned his face only for a
[1:11:27] minute our husband took our ass the Sun
[1:11:31] refused to shine the moon refused to
[1:11:33] give us life it's always just for a
[1:11:35] moment
[1:11:36] he'll Bank is just why because law judge
[1:11:39] the scene I paid for my sins in the body
[1:11:46] of my husband
[1:11:48] we was guilty by birth into this world
[1:11:51] do you know that's right he was guilty
[1:11:53] board the nature of a sinner opponents
[1:11:55] and God's wrath had to be poured out
[1:11:57] because the soul that sinneth shall
[1:11:58] surely die something had to be struck my
[1:12:02] judgment and God's law could not be
[1:12:04] broken due to the consequences of
[1:12:06] breaking and God could not not keep his
[1:12:08] word something had to appease God's
[1:12:10] justice
[1:12:11] thus in question had to be answered
[1:12:13] something had to bring me back to
[1:12:15] fellowship something had to redeem you
[1:12:17] how the house of your bondsman we was
[1:12:19] born in the falling condition we was
[1:12:21] born in a fallen state come on that's
[1:12:24] not the way we should have been here
[1:12:26] we're signs were daughters we're
[1:12:29] attributes of God we live in a fallen
[1:12:33] world you know this was right we live in
[1:12:36] a fallen creation and everything's
[1:12:38] groaning and travailing and pain right
[1:12:42] you live in a fallen world and we know
[1:12:45] we're living in that kind of a condition
[1:12:47] this nation has fallen morals has fallen
[1:12:51] come on
[1:12:53] marriage has fallen that's the state and
[1:12:57] condition everything that's around us
[1:12:59] the bodies we live in they're falling
[1:13:02] the earth is groaning the bodies we live
[1:13:07] in we see it every day oh my nobody born
[1:13:10] saved everybody was born in this
[1:13:13] condition we was born shackled up we was
[1:13:17] born in the house of the bondsman we
[1:13:20] didn't have a choice
[1:13:21] come on I said God put us here God
[1:13:24] planned us here God placed us here
[1:13:28] no matter what kind of value made he was
[1:13:31] still in that condition he's allowed
[1:13:33] there better I'll make things matter
[1:13:35] I'll stop this I'll quit this he was
[1:13:37] still in a falling condition but the
[1:13:41] abandonment was just brief just for a
[1:13:44] moment my only hope has that God would
[1:13:49] reach their tour I was at he would reach
[1:13:52] down to where you was at that his arms
[1:13:55] would reach all the way Tory was at and
[1:13:57] he would get a hold of you and that's
[1:14:00] what we need and listen friends that's
[1:14:02] what Israel needed that's why I don't
[1:14:04] need it that's what we needed we needed
[1:14:07] rescued from ourselves this is why we
[1:14:14] need deliverance preached in the house
[1:14:16] of God this is why we need Liberty to
[1:14:18] preach in the house of God hallelujah
[1:14:23] I needed deliverance and you need to
[1:14:25] deliverance but I couldn't help myself
[1:14:27] and you couldn't help yourself
[1:14:29] we're his victims he was in this house
[1:14:32] of this bondsman I needed something that
[1:14:34] could take and stop my fall I need
[1:14:39] something that could get a hold of me
[1:14:40] just like you needed something to get a
[1:14:42] hold of you to stop this fall we were
[1:14:47] sinking in the depravity of sin and
[1:14:50] living in the arms of paramours of
[1:14:52] Laodicea I needed something that was
[1:14:54] strong enough you needed something that
[1:14:57] was strong enough hallelujah
[1:15:01] there was only one that can do it the
[1:15:03] one who have bounced for you Hosea's
[1:15:09] wife was in a falling condition but
[1:15:12] Hosea didn't give up on her he cannot
[1:15:15] simply cast her away and God cannot cast
[1:15:18] Israel way and God cannot cast you away
[1:15:23] but that Ash have you been pulled on the
[1:15:26] love it compels him to go looking for
[1:15:28] you he may have found me like that but
[1:15:32] he didn't leave me like that he may have
[1:15:35] found you like that but he didn't leave
[1:15:37] you like that
[1:15:39] I'm told that I gotta reach down into
[1:15:41] the sand where you was at he's God
[1:15:45] that's rich in mercy you believe that
[1:15:48] didn't matter the condition it didn't
[1:15:51] matter how Baxley didn't matter how much
[1:15:53] of a drunk it didn't matter how much
[1:15:55] don't be stuck in your veins he can't
[1:15:58] forget about you
[1:16:00] so God got ahold of you
[1:16:05] God chose more grace than what man chose
[1:16:12] it's as though his love is so reckless
[1:16:15] that there ain't no boundary he won't
[1:16:17] cross
[1:16:18] there ain't no situation he won't get
[1:16:20] down into it's though it's just reckless
[1:16:23] love that had all cost exactly at all
[1:16:26] cost I said it all cost he would get a
[1:16:30] hold of you oh my had it been me and you
[1:16:32] I'm sure we wouldn't we give up on
[1:16:34] ourselves a long time ago we win at Oh
[1:16:38] God he should have just left us in the
[1:16:40] house of our lovers come out but I want
[1:16:42] to tell you Hosea couldn't give up on
[1:16:44] her Adam couldn't give up on her and God
[1:16:46] take him up on you the arm of God saved
[1:16:51] us by his power God's arm symbolizes his
[1:16:57] strength his arm symbolizes Redemption
[1:17:04] his arm symbolizes power lower to God so
[1:17:10] we had the strength of God we got the
[1:17:13] redemption of God and we got the power
[1:17:15] of
[1:17:17] for David set like this and Psalms 98
[1:17:20] more in a hurry Oh singing the Lord a
[1:17:22] new song sing unto the Lord a new song
[1:17:26] not the songs of your paramours
[1:17:29] not the songs are those who lovers sing
[1:17:32] a new song unto the Lord for he had done
[1:17:35] marvelous things his right hand and his
[1:17:38] holy arm has gotten him it has gotten
[1:17:47] him the victory Jeremiah would top it
[1:17:51] like this all Lord God behold thou has
[1:17:54] made the heaven and the earth by by
[1:17:56] great power and stretched out arm and
[1:18:00] there is nothing too hard for thee but

[1:18:08] situation you don't understand my God's
[1:18:10] Word there's nothing too hard for thee
[1:18:12] but you don't know what I'm dealing with
[1:18:14] you don't know the power that my God has
[1:18:16] you don't know his capability I said
[1:18:18] there is nothing too hard for the Lord
[1:18:22] [Applause]
[1:18:25] Moses would tell us in Deuteronomy 719
[1:18:28] the great temptations which that I saw
[1:18:30] and the signs and the wonders and the
[1:18:34] mighty hand and the stretched out arm
[1:18:40] whereby the Lord that God brought thee
[1:18:47] so God was going to bring them out and
[1:18:50] he was going to do it by his arm so he
[1:18:53] put a man in his hand
[1:18:56] he's always used man come out and he
[1:19:00] always will use man what does he need
[1:19:03] just get somebody surrendered in his
[1:19:04] head

[1:19:12] that God brought the out so Israel came
[1:19:17] out of Egypt by stretched out arm he
[1:19:23] redeemed them from sin by his arm with
[1:19:27] his power that's the six six
[1:19:30] wherefore saying to the children of
[1:19:33] Israel I am the Lord and I will bring
[1:19:38] you out from under the burdens of the
[1:19:40] Egyptians and I will rid you out of
[1:19:44] their bondage and I'm gonna read a new
[1:19:49] with a stretched-out
[1:19:51] I don't think you're understanding me
[1:19:57] which stretched out arms he's gonna read
[1:20:02] English with stretched out arms he would

[1:20:17] how about stretched out arms he would
[1:20:20] redeem there he would catch you in your
[1:20:22] sia he would reach down towards there
[1:20:24] was a stretch arms hallelujah don't you
[1:20:33] see he caught you that they're covering
[1:20:35] he caught you that day he redeems you
[1:20:38] that day he showed us he would reach all
[1:20:44] the way from heaven all the way down to
[1:20:47] the blackness of this earth and with a
[1:20:50] stretched out arm how he would stop the
[1:20:54] fall he would catch you from the fall
[1:20:56] how with an outstretched arm he's
[1:21:00] agonizing because your sins was heavy
[1:21:03] but he caught you your life was marked
[1:21:08] but he caught you with an outstretched
[1:21:11] arm God was a spirit and a spirit can't
[1:21:16] bleed so he had to stretch himself from
[1:21:19] heaven all the way they'll burst I said
[1:21:24] he stretched his arms all the way from
[1:21:26] heaven all the way down he became one of
[1:21:28] us he became a man
[1:21:29] how about stretched out arms he come
[1:21:32] down into a body he condon send into a
[1:21:35] body he had to create something that's
[1:21:38] what he'd done in the garden that's what
[1:21:40] he'd done for Abraham rather that's what
[1:21:42] he's got to do for you he's Jehovah
[1:21:45] Jireh he's a provider and Adam's race
[1:21:49] was facing abandonment so God allowed
[1:21:52] sin he allowed this the judgment of sin
[1:21:56] to strike him and just for a moment it's
[1:21:59] as though his head was turned from us we
[1:22:02] needed a cover we needed his eyes upon
[1:22:04] us we needed his mercy upon us he
[1:22:07] realized we needed him to look upon us
[1:22:10] did not Isaiah tell us who has believed
[1:22:13] our report and to whom come on is the
[1:22:17] arm of the Lord revealed whom is the arm
[1:22:21] of the Lord revealed what's he's showing
[1:22:24] us he come down and become a man he
[1:22:29] shall grow up before him as a tender
[1:22:30] plant has a root how's the dry ground is
[1:22:33] no former covenant but when we shall see
[1:22:36] him there's no beauty that we should
[1:22:38] desire him he was despised rejected of
[1:22:42] men a man of sorrows acquainted with
[1:22:45] grief we hid as it was this we hid as it
[1:22:49] were our faces did not I had him hide
[1:22:55] did not they not hide they heard he was
[1:23:00] despised and we esteemed him not
[1:23:01] his grief so great because he taunted
[1:23:07] Sinan and stretched out his arms oh my
[1:23:11] he realised it's as though one would
[1:23:14] hide his face it means to hide his face
[1:23:18] the hiding of face
[1:23:21] is a sign of guilt the hiding of the
[1:23:24] face as a sign of condemnation it's a
[1:23:29] sign of being a cursed it means to look
[1:23:32] away because it's so detestable that you
[1:23:34] can't hardly stand it that he would have
[1:23:36] to look away are you with me now he
[1:23:40] realized it would be a top of leprosy
[1:23:42] that the leper would be required to
[1:23:45] cover up his face and Jesus became a
[1:23:48] leper for me all but God would unfold
[1:23:55] the mystery of it whenever Moses went
[1:23:59] down there that day into Egypt and he
[1:24:01] would take that hand which had no
[1:24:04] leprosy at all and he would reach it
[1:24:06] into his bosom and he would pull it out
[1:24:08] and I'd be in the last stages of leprosy
[1:24:11] but it wouldn't stay that way he would
[1:24:13] reach back into his bosom and he would
[1:24:16] pull that hand back out and the hand
[1:24:18] would be back to its original condition
[1:24:20] it was before the leprosy struck it
[1:24:23] don't you see friends that's the story
[1:24:26] of your life the first time he was born
[1:24:29] he was pulled from the bosom of God he
[1:24:31] was born in a lepers condition but
[1:24:33] leprosy all over you why did God do he
[1:24:36] took your life and he puts you back into
[1:24:38] his bosom hallelujah he puts you back
[1:24:41] into his bosom and when you come out of
[1:24:43] the bosom of cross he was back to your
[1:24:45] original condition where he never sinned
[1:24:47] in the first place you never had leprosy
[1:24:50] to begin with I wasn't born to be a
[1:24:59] leper I was born to be a child of God a
[1:25:01] son of God
[1:25:04] but here to put me into his visor that's
[1:25:07] what he did that their Calvary he
[1:25:09] reached into his bosom and he pulled you
[1:25:11] back out to bring you back Oh God and
[1:25:21] then what would he do
[1:25:23] shine his face upon you the face shining
[1:25:27] is a sign of grace his face as a sign of
[1:25:32] his presence hallelujah oh my god
[1:25:36] commended the priesthood to tell the
[1:25:38] people to let his face shine on you for
[1:25:44] numbers would saying number six
[1:25:46] twenty-three speaking to Aaron and his
[1:25:47] son saying on this wise he shall bless
[1:25:50] the children of Israel watch this not
[1:25:53] curse them but this is a sign of
[1:25:55] blessings the Lord bless thee and keep
[1:25:58] thee the Lord make his face to shine
[1:26:01] upon thee and be gracious unto thee the
[1:26:06] word gracious means to show favor number
[1:26:15] says the Lord lift up his countenance
[1:26:17] upon thee and give thee peace and they
[1:26:21] should put my name upon the children of
[1:26:23] Israel and I will bless them his face is
[1:26:32] a sign of His grace his countless lifted
[1:26:35] upon you as a sign of peace it's a sign
[1:26:38] of favor it's a sign of mercy it's a
[1:26:42] sign of love think about it simply
[1:26:45] because he stretched out his arms and
[1:26:47] reached down to where you was at it
[1:26:51] wasn't because she was deserving of it
[1:26:53] and neither was I it's because he have
[1:26:56] vouched his love and by that love
[1:26:59] covenant he knew exactly where you would
[1:27:02] be yet he knew what you'd be dealing
[1:27:03] with he knew what you'd be going through
[1:27:04] he knew what trouble you'd have but let
[1:27:06] me tell you if he can deliver his
[1:27:08] children out of Egypt if he can deliver
[1:27:10] them out of Assyria then tell me what
[1:27:13] can stop me
[1:27:15] from delivering you now right here in
[1:27:17] the most wicked day that there ever has
[1:27:19] been tell me what can keep God from
[1:27:22] getting the hold of you
[1:27:23] stretched out arms he stretched all the
[1:27:27] way down to the Laodicea and he unlocked
[1:27:29] those shackles from their neck and he
[1:27:33] said arise awake and arise you're free

[1:27:41] attributes of God sit in this place I've
[1:27:45] redeemed you by mighty hand let's bow
