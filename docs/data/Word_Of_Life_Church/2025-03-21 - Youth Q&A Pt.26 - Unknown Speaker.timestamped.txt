[21:49] shout praise the Lord what a privilege
[21:52] for us to be able to stand once again in
[21:55] the presence of almighty God
[21:58] imagine if we would have been
[22:00] Gentiles and we would have heard that
[22:03] God was moving among a a group of people
[22:06] that say lived over in
[22:08] elizabethon and they were called Jews or
[22:12] Hebrews or
[22:14] Israelites and we could see in the
[22:16] distance that Pillar of Fire hanging
[22:18] over the top of that
[22:20] Tabernacle and we heard God had opened
[22:23] the Red Sea and God had fed them and God
[22:26] had done such wonderful things but we
[22:28] were
[22:29] Gentiles so we just stand on the outside
[22:32] and say man what it must be like to have
[22:36] a living God like that and we just dream
[22:39] about it and think about it but you know
[22:42] what we don't have to dream about it
[22:44] tonight that God is our God aren't you
[22:48] glad and we're so glad that we don't
[22:50] have to point back in time and so well
[22:53] God used to do great things boy when
[22:56] brother Brandon was here God done
[22:57] awesome things when Paul was here God
[23:00] done awesome things well they're not
[23:03] here but he still is here amen we're so
[23:07] grateful for that we're going to pray
[23:09] before we start the question answers and
[23:11] um just a couple of requests that I want
[23:13] to make known to you tonight brother
[23:15] Steve Nome is in real real need of
[23:18] prayer not able to eat and and they
[23:20] found he has some kidney stones which
[23:22] has been really really painful for him
[23:24] and just having several issues in his
[23:27] body um also I mentioned it last night
[23:29] about brother Michael Carter and his
[23:31] family and also Carol was was not
[23:34] feeling good unable to be here tonight
[23:36] so I wonder how many of you have a
[23:38] request just like to lift your hand
[23:40] there before the Lord all right Heavenly
[23:43] Father we we have been invited to come
[23:45] into your
[23:47] presence to bring our petitions our
[23:50] needs and our
[23:51] requests so as little children we come
[23:55] before you tonight and when we were
[23:58] small children and we would ask our
[24:00] parents for things and sometimes they
[24:03] would say yes and sometimes we might ask
[24:06] for something that we didn't realize it
[24:09] but it could actually cause us harm down
[24:11] the road and our parents might say no
[24:15] you can't have that or no I cannot give
[24:18] you that well why mama why daddy there's
[24:21] something in us that inquisitive thing
[24:24] so Lord all we know to do is bring our
[24:27] petitions before for you and we know
[24:29] you've done us the same way there's
[24:31] things we've asked you for and you've
[24:33] said no there's other things we've asked
[24:36] you for and maybe you gave us a wait a
[24:38] while but we know that when we pray so
[24:42] all we know to do is bring our petitions
[24:44] and just say father your will be done
[24:48] that way we know when we're praying
[24:51] we're always praying in the will of God
[24:54] so if we would ask for anything that
[24:57] would hinder us anything that would not
[24:59] be your will then father we pray your
[25:02] will would take precedent over our
[25:05] desire and our request but we believe
[25:09] Lord that whenever we come together like
[25:11] this that we're always asking for the
[25:15] right thing for you to be in our midst
[25:18] for you said in your word if any two or
[25:21] three are gathered together in my name
[25:23] I'll be in their midst that's not based
[25:25] upon Thursday nights Wednesday night
[25:28] wedes wind rain snow Sun you gave no
[25:31] conditions to that promise and we're so
[25:33] grateful we sent you already here
[25:36] tonight Lord and we want to thank you
[25:40] the building ain't full there's not
[25:42] hundreds like there was here last night
[25:44] and Sunday and and we'll be Sunday
[25:46] coming up and then in just a few short
[25:48] days our youth Gathering and hundreds
[25:50] will gather again I'm so grateful you
[25:53] didn't lend it just where it would have
[25:55] to be a minimum of 200 or a minimum of
[25:58] 300 but we know your way is if there's
[26:01] only one that you would come so we ask
[26:05] you'd help us tonight help me father to
[26:07] be able to get out of the way we pray
[26:09] that you be mindful of the sick Lord
[26:11] Brother Ste Steve new has a real need in
[26:13] his body father you know his situation
[26:16] we pray for our brother tonight dear God
[26:19] In The Name of Jesus we pray for brother
[26:21] Michael Carter and his family also Lord
[26:24] ask you that you'd be mindful of Carol
[26:26] tonight and all feel like coming to Ser
[26:27] service and others that are sick and
[26:29] needy all these these young people had
[26:32] needs and desires be mindful of them we
[26:35] pray in the name of Jesus Amen praise
[26:39] the
[26:40] Lord I know you're probably wondering if
[26:42] I'm ever going to get this question
[26:44] answered like we keep going back to the
[26:46] same one over and over again but I've
[26:49] just found so many wonderful things
[26:51] about it because it it certainly affects
[26:54] all of our Lives can you explain why
[26:57] brother brandom is Vindicated prophet
[26:59] and why the message is correct I have a
[27:02] difficult time speaking to why I believe
[27:06] what I believe God bless you you may be
[27:08] seated so we'll read first of all
[27:10] tonight from the scripture in the book
[27:13] of 1st Samuel chapter 3:1 I know that
[27:15] we've referred to this already but just
[27:18] for a little more of a foundation
[27:20] tonight and the child Samuel ministered
[27:23] unto the Lord before Eli and the word
[27:28] word of the Lord was
[27:30] precious in those days the word of the
[27:34] Lord was precious in those days and
[27:37] there was no open Vision now that seems
[27:42] like a strange vernacular for us but let
[27:45] me show you what it actually means so
[27:48] the word open means to break through or
[27:52] to burst out or to break open so there
[27:57] was no breaking through or no bursting
[28:00] out and that that's the word open and
[28:03] then the word vision is Vision in a
[28:07] static state or
[28:10] Oracle prophecy or a Divine
[28:15] communication now during this time when
[28:18] this is written they had already had now
[28:21] the first five books of Moses which they
[28:23] was calling the Torah which was the law
[28:26] so why would the word of the Lord be
[28:29] precious they already had Genesis Exodus
[28:33] Leviticus Numbers and Deuteronomy Joshua
[28:36] comes sometime after that so they
[28:38] already had books that they could read
[28:41] which they believe was the word of God
[28:43] so why was the word precious well it
[28:46] it's an it's a certain part of the word
[28:49] that was precious and that was the open
[28:52] Vision so they needed something that
[28:55] would be currently applicable
[28:58] to the day and the hour that they live
[29:01] so the Torah was there and they could
[29:04] still be able to do that but it was
[29:06] mostly containing Thou shalt and thou
[29:09] shalt not you dress this certain way
[29:12] you'll not mix linen and Woolen together
[29:16] in your garments so when you plant your
[29:18] garden you'll not sew diverse kinds of
[29:21] seed in your field if you've got a scab
[29:25] you've got a soar you've got a certain
[29:27] way to treat it
[29:28] if you've got a a bloody flux you've got
[29:31] a certain way so it was one thing after
[29:34] another after another but they were
[29:36] facing issues in this day and time that
[29:40] they needed help they needed to be
[29:42] enlightened on what to do so the Torah
[29:45] actually didn't cover some of the needs
[29:48] where they were me Carol was talking
[29:50] about y I told her said you know it's
[29:52] absolutely amazing that God could have
[29:54] made the Bible where the Bible in every
[29:58] age would constantly be added to so God
[30:02] would have given the Bible in the days
[30:04] of the book of Acts and then God in a
[30:07] few years later after a couple of
[30:08] centuries or so God could have sent
[30:10] other men they would have wrote it down
[30:12] and say all right now this is a
[30:14] supplement to your Bible then in another
[30:17] 2300 years there would be another
[30:20] supplement and another supplement and
[30:22] another supplement and then in our day
[30:24] there would been another one why why
[30:27] would that seem NE necessary because sin
[30:30] advances how many of us believe that
[30:33] it's wrong for a woman to abort her
[30:37] baby where does the bible say
[30:43] that how many believes it's wrong for
[30:45] young people old people to take fentanyl
[30:49] morphine
[30:51] cocaine where does the bible say
[30:54] that how many believes it be wrong for a
[30:57] father to have incest with his
[31:01] daughter where does the bible say
[31:05] that ah I thought I'd get you now what I
[31:09] find amazing is most of the
[31:11] denominational churches preach against
[31:14] every one of them questions I just
[31:18] raised so where did they get scripture
[31:20] from it for it to back it
[31:23] up testing one two now this happens to
[31:26] the old people I didn't think it
[31:27] happened to you young people I'm losing
[31:30] communication now you see God knew that
[31:34] sin would advance and there would be
[31:37] television there would be smartphones
[31:40] there would be all kinds of things so if
[31:43] we are held simply by the restriction or
[31:47] the vernacular of the Old Testament and
[31:50] the new I can never preach against
[31:52] another abuse of a smartphone I cannot
[31:56] scripturally stand
[31:58] and preach against some of the very
[32:00] things that I just mentioned to you so
[32:02] drug addiction that's gone smoking
[32:05] cigarettes that's gone preaching against
[32:08] denominations that's gone there were no
[32:11] denominations when the Bible was
[32:13] written so how is God going to deal with
[32:17] sin in the Modern Age God will update it
[32:22] but he don't bring a new Bible he sends
[32:25] men with the word of the Lord
[32:28] now you see in this setting of Samuel it
[32:31] was such a time frame again now they had
[32:35] already come to a spot to where that
[32:38] they were changing toward the emphasis
[32:41] of the Nations around them now in the
[32:44] Old Testament when the people of God
[32:45] moved into the land of of promised or
[32:48] land of Palestine later become Palestine
[32:50] actually but whenever they moved into
[32:53] that the the Torah gave them a few
[32:56] things in the book of Deuteronomy and a
[32:59] few things in the Book of Leviticus when
[33:01] you get to the land do this and this and
[33:03] this but for the most part it was not
[33:06] written concerning their due inheritance
[33:10] Joshua said a little bit about it but
[33:13] not much so it was more about their
[33:16] behavior and the journey and what they
[33:18] would do so what God did was God needed
[33:23] to be able to send a word that would
[33:26] pertain to the time frame because around
[33:29] all the Canaanites and there's different
[33:31] people around them and they were
[33:34] Nations Nations keep that in mind
[33:37] Nations so they was around these people
[33:40] and they would start acting like them so
[33:43] then we know that Israel come to a time
[33:45] that they wanted a king and why did they
[33:49] tell this man here Samuel when he grew
[33:51] up and become an older man what was
[33:54] their excuse for telling him they said
[33:56] we want a king King like all the rest of
[34:00] the
[34:02] Nations so Israel their entire history
[34:05] they fought against the
[34:08] separation from
[34:11] Nations we don't find it so much today
[34:15] with
[34:16] Nations as much as we do
[34:22] denoms so we have
[34:26] denominations around us
[34:28] and they want to constantly oh you don't
[34:30] need to do that you don't have to dress
[34:32] that way you don't have to preach this
[34:33] you don't need all that stuff as Israel
[34:36] thought it was Nations so do we now
[34:40] think whenever Samuel was born he was he
[34:43] was of course a prophet from from his
[34:45] birth ordained of God but he starts out
[34:48] as a young boy so the word of the Lord
[34:51] was precious in other words there was no
[34:54] one that would be able to break into the
[34:56] realm of his eyes being wide open and
[34:59] the word of the Lord come to him in such
[35:02] a perfect way that it would be the same
[35:05] as if it was a written
[35:10] bible now I know that staggers a lot of
[35:12] people but it ain't my fault they're
[35:14] ignorant and dumb if they'd read their
[35:16] Bible they'd realize it now watch this
[35:19] and the child Samuel ministered unto the
[35:22] Lord before Eli which was a priest and
[35:24] the word of the Lord was precious in
[35:26] those days there was no open Vision now
[35:30] we read this last time Proverbs 29:18
[35:33] where there is no vision exact same
[35:37] thing now remember the word Vision here
[35:40] is not well our church has got a vision
[35:42] we're going to expand we're going to
[35:43] grow we're going to have a baseball team
[35:45] a basketball team a football team a
[35:47] soccer team we're going to play tag on
[35:49] Wednesday we're going to play Bingle on
[35:51] Thursday and we're doing all this so we
[35:53] can have a vision people are absolutely
[35:56] defaming God's word by using this
[36:00] scripture for church growth it has
[36:03] nothing to do with church
[36:07] grows and they're adding to the word of
[36:09] God when they do it where there is no
[36:12] vision the people Parish it is an
[36:14] estatic State an oracle a prophecy
[36:19] Divine communication I wonder where we'd
[36:22] be tonight if God had not sent us his
[36:26] Prophet messenger
[36:28] and the people will perish and you can
[36:30] see why Satan wants to pull people away
[36:35] from a prophetic Insight so what would
[36:38] we do we'd all revert back just to
[36:41] reading the Bible we love our Bible I
[36:44] love my Bible now more than I did when I
[36:47] first started reading it as a 12y old
[36:50] boy and the message never replace my
[36:53] Bible and it never will as a matter of
[36:55] fact it helps me to un understand my
[36:58] Bible better but when I read my Bible I
[37:03] read my Bible through the understanding
[37:06] of an of an open Vision in this last day
[37:11] now many of your friends that you work
[37:13] with when to school with college with
[37:15] some of you that you work with now good
[37:17] Baptist people Methodist people Lutheran
[37:19] people that may have the exact same
[37:21] version of Bible you have but why is it
[37:24] they don't see the same things you do
[37:26] some of them are spring sprinkled some
[37:28] of them are baptized in titles some of
[37:30] them believe this and that and the other
[37:32] some of them may said under a woman
[37:34] preacher some of them may believe all
[37:36] kinds of things over 45,000
[37:39] denominations as I mentioned to you last
[37:41] time and what do most of them say
[37:43] they're based on the
[37:45] Bible the Bible so we don't need a new
[37:48] Bible do we we don't need a new
[37:51] rendition of the Bible what did we need
[37:54] an open Vision that would point us right
[37:57] back brother re did not come to write us
[38:00] a new Bible we didn't need a new Bible
[38:02] we needed an open Vision to say how does
[38:06] Matthew
[38:07] 28:19 tie together with acts
[38:10] 238 when you get time sometime ask AI on
[38:15] chat
[38:16] GPT when was water baptism changed one
[38:21] of the brothers of our church just did
[38:23] it a few weeks ago and he sent it to me
[38:26] and even the
[38:27] AI had the date right the Nan Council
[38:32] right and spit it out several paragraphs
[38:35] then he asked AI what about the serpent
[38:39] Seed doctrine and it spit it right back
[38:42] out again and people think brother
[38:44] Brandon was the one that come up with
[38:46] the serpent Seed doctrine huh this has
[38:48] been believed by the Hebrews for
[38:52] millennium praise the Lord so what do we
[38:55] need not a new Bible not a new
[38:57] commentary but a man that had the
[39:00] ability of God to have an open vision
[39:04] and say this is the correct baptism
[39:06] right here acts 238 is the
[39:10] interpretation of Matthew
[39:13] 28:19 wonderful praise the Lord now
[39:16] let's watch and see how accurate that
[39:20] when a prophet who is gifted by God
[39:23] breaks into the supernatural Realm by
[39:27] Vision or
[39:29] SLR I want you to notice this it's it's
[39:31] quite shocking numbers
[39:36] 24:2
[39:38] balum
[39:40] lifted up his
[39:43] eyes now remember
[39:46] balum wound up being
[39:50] identified as a false
[39:52] prophet the Bible actually calls him in
[39:55] the Book of Joshua I'll share it with
[39:57] you in a
[39:58] moment as a
[40:01] soothsayer but balum had a genuine gift
[40:06] in his life now watch how
[40:08] infallable this gift actually is though
[40:11] the man himself was not now balam lifted
[40:15] up his eyes and he saw Israel abiding in
[40:19] his tents according to their
[40:23] tribes and the spirit of God came upon
[40:28] him and he took up his Parable and said
[40:32] balum the son of beor hath said the man
[40:37] whose eyes are
[40:40] open hath said now y all remember the
[40:44] background of this story there was a
[40:46] great King by the name of
[40:49] BAC and he heard the children of Israel
[40:52] were coming up and they were coming near
[40:55] the land of Moab he did not want them
[40:58] around his people he despised them so he
[41:02] heard that there was a Prophet by the
[41:05] name of balum so he sent some of his
[41:08] Messengers over to hire him that he
[41:12] might be able to curse the children of
[41:16] Israel now because a a prophet's gift
[41:21] seemed to the
[41:23] untaught very similar to a witch
[41:27] or a
[41:29] soothsayer or a fortune
[41:31] teller so baac thought well I've heard
[41:36] of witches and I've heard of susers so
[41:40] maybe we need to get us a man like a a
[41:43] medium one that will be able to come and
[41:46] call on the name of his gods and curse
[41:49] these people must have been a strange
[41:52] perception in this time frame so he
[41:56] comes to balum send The Messengers and
[41:58] Bam said let me ask God God said don't
[42:01] you go with these people what are these
[42:03] people doing you're at your
[42:04] house well Lord they come he said no
[42:07] don't you go all right praise the Lord
[42:10] all right so he goes down and tell them
[42:13] hey you know what God told me not
[42:15] go you know the story baac sends some
[42:19] more people greater notoriety greater
[42:22] men offers him a little bit more of a
[42:24] reward hey Bam you know what B said he'd
[42:28] make you this you can be a district man
[42:30] you can be a presbyter an overseer
[42:32] whatever more he said well let me go
[42:34] back and ask the Lord see if the Lord
[42:37] might change his mind about his
[42:39] word you remember the story don't you so
[42:41] he goes back and he asks God God said
[42:44] yeah go
[42:47] on Lord have
[42:50] mercy now BB should have known God never
[42:54] changes his mind about his word
[42:57] but if you want something I want
[42:59] something so bad God might even tell you
[43:03] to do
[43:04] it there's women who want to preach so
[43:07] bad and there's some of them in the
[43:09] discernment that you'll find it and
[43:11] brother brenon would call them out and
[43:13] tell them I see you're a woman
[43:16] preacher now you imagine some of them
[43:18] women leaving those meetings and said
[43:20] God's Prophet told me I was a woman
[43:25] preacher God's Prophet wouldn't changing
[43:27] God's word just simply giving them what
[43:31] they
[43:31] wanted now God gave balam the same thing
[43:34] his mule you remember he beat his mule
[43:37] and the mule saw an angel of the Lord
[43:39] sing in the way I'll go back go back
[43:41] said no go on that's what you want go
[43:46] on but this is the amazing thing about
[43:48] it to me God gets this man and he has a
[43:52] real genuine
[43:54] gift so his eyes are white open and then
[43:58] he says he hath said which heard the
[44:03] words of
[44:05] God and saw the vision of the
[44:11] almighty now he's using words that are
[44:14] descriptive of God that was only known
[44:18] to a select number of people on the
[44:21] Earth the
[44:24] almighty falling into a TR
[44:27] now I know it's hard for us to realize
[44:29] this but having his eyes open so he's
[44:32] just sitting here like you and I would
[44:33] be today and he just falls into a trance
[44:36] and it must have been a spooky thing
[44:39] this look on his face he's he's in a
[44:42] days and and they could pinch him and
[44:45] and hit him but he can't come out of it
[44:47] he's just sitting there like this and
[44:49] his eyes are
[44:52] just his eyes are wide open and he's in
[44:55] a
[44:56] trance now watch what accompanies this
[45:00] trance how
[45:02] goodly are thy tents oh
[45:06] Jacob and thy
[45:08] Tabernacles oh
[45:12] Israel as the valleys are they spread
[45:16] forth as Gardens by the
[45:19] Riverside as the Trees of the lion alows
[45:23] which the Lord has planted as cedar
[45:27] trees beside the waters he shall pour
[45:30] the water out of his buckets his seed
[45:33] shall be in many
[45:36] Waters as his and his King shall be
[45:40] higher than
[45:42] AAG and his kingdom shall be
[45:45] exalted God brought him forth out of
[45:48] Egypt now remember who's saying this
[45:51] it's not Moses it's not Jeremiah it's
[45:54] not ezek it's not Hagi it's it's
[45:58] balum the
[46:01] soothsayer
[46:03] balum the
[46:05] compromiser so this is my question to
[46:12] you if God could so put a gift in a life
[46:17] of a
[46:19] man who would wind up going to
[46:24] hell and that gift was so perfect that
[46:28] he could
[46:30] not could not say anything other than
[46:36] what God put in his
[46:39] mouth and if God could do that through a
[46:42] false
[46:44] prophet what about a true one amen Carol
[46:47] asked me the last time we had question
[46:49] an said are you done with the prophet
[46:51] part of I think yeah I said yeah I think
[46:53] so I ain't got but just maybe a few more
[46:54] scriptures and I I'm I'm probably going
[46:56] to be done with it so what I always like
[46:58] to do is go the next day and and start
[47:00] studing again looked at it so I took my
[47:02] computer and sat down and I I was going
[47:04] through and you know taking all the
[47:05] scriptures and all that out and all of a
[47:07] sudden the spirit of God spoke to me
[47:10] this scripture and I thought rro here we
[47:14] go and oh my goodness when I get in here
[47:17] and I got and started looking at these
[47:18] things I thought oh Jesus thank you so
[47:22] you can imagine now baac is hearing this
[47:27] so his his consorts and all the people
[47:29] that are around him now that they're
[47:31] excited because boy I mean this man he's
[47:34] going to B him he's going to say you
[47:36] bunch of low down rotten people you
[47:39] Israelites you're you've got adultery
[47:42] you've got Liars I curse you in the name
[47:45] of my
[47:47] God but instead he says oh
[47:51] Jacob how goodly are thy tents
[47:57] God brought him forth out of Egypt he
[48:00] has as it were the
[48:02] strength as of a
[48:04] unicorn he shall eat up the
[48:09] Nations his
[48:11] enemies and there he was in the
[48:13] headquarters of one of
[48:15] them so this man is speaking against
[48:18] them so you hire somebody to curse me
[48:21] but the said he curses you and blesses
[48:25] me I mean that's going to make you feel
[48:27] like shouting right going to make you
[48:29] feel like hitting that man in the head
[48:31] with a wet noodle you're going to put
[48:32] him in jail you're you say what in the
[48:34] world's the matter with you I didn't
[48:36] hire you for that but God is showing us
[48:39] something young people God is showing us
[48:42] said if a man has that gift though that
[48:45] man himself could have been as rotten
[48:47] and the evil as he could be but God
[48:49] could speak his word so perfectly out of
[48:51] that man's mouth do you understand some
[48:54] of the greatest Messianic prophecy
[48:57] of the Old
[48:58] Testament were spoken out of the mouth
[49:02] of this lying false
[49:05] prophet but it wasn't his prophecy that
[49:08] was
[49:09] wrong it was his
[49:15] Doctrine
[49:16] wow I figured the devil would be
[49:19] squirming tonight like I don't know
[49:23] what watch how he says he shall eat up
[49:26] the Nations as enemies and shall break
[49:29] their
[49:30] bones and Pierce them through with his
[49:34] ARS even Moses never said this Joshua
[49:38] never gave them these prophecies some of
[49:41] the Great Men of God that live prior to
[49:44] this never said this so you imagine
[49:46] years and years passed by and they
[49:49] referred back to the prophecy of this
[49:54] man he couched he laid down as a lion as
[49:58] a great lion who shall stir him up
[50:02] blessed is he that blesseth thee and
[50:07] cursed is
[50:09] he that curseth
[50:13] thee now notice the next verse and bac's
[50:18] anger was kindled against
[50:22] bam and he smoted his hands together and
[50:25] said baac
[50:28] baac said unto bam I call Thee I call
[50:32] thee to curse my enemies and
[50:34] behold thou us all together bless them
[50:38] these three times this ain't the last
[50:40] time that he done that he's already done
[50:42] it
[50:44] twice now young people I ask you if God
[50:47] could do that to a
[50:50] man who later will turn out to be one of
[50:53] the greatest detriments that Israel ever
[50:55] had
[50:58] because he's going to teach baac by his
[51:03] Doctrine how to seduce
[51:07] Israel so his Doctrine and his
[51:11] prophecy were millions of miles
[51:16] apart this is one of the ways you and I
[51:19] can judge a
[51:22] prophet don't just look at their
[51:25] prophecies don't just look at their
[51:27] healings their miracles their
[51:30] discernments but watch their Doctrine
[51:33] praise the Lord I about had me a fit
[51:35] when I saw this I'll tell you what oh my
[51:39] notice now in verse
[51:41] 15 so he says try it again you know come
[51:44] on come on baby come on try it
[51:48] again and he took up his Parable and
[51:50] said balam the son of
[51:53] beor hath said the man whose eyes are
[51:56] open has said he has said which heard
[52:00] the words of God and knew the knowledge
[52:04] of el
[52:07] Elon the most
[52:11] high Abraham was the first human being
[52:14] on the earth to ever utter these words
[52:18] where did Bam get this l l yon one of
[52:23] the Sacred secret names compound names
[52:26] names of
[52:29] adoni but this man is speaking words he
[52:33] don't even know you understand that's
[52:35] the way true tongues and true
[52:38] interpretation and true prophecy is that
[52:41] a person can speak things that's beyond
[52:43] their own wisdom
[52:45] amen these preachers Brothers will
[52:48] understand you'll be up preaching
[52:49] sometimes and you'll be preaching by the
[52:51] spirit of God and the Holy Ghost will
[52:53] anoint you to say things and it'll scare
[52:55] you when you say and say oh my goodness
[52:58] I hope that was right was that right
[53:00] Lord that was right I hope that was
[53:03] right cuz it scares you see when you
[53:05] when you know it then you can say it
[53:07] with such confidence this is what I
[53:09] always do I go home that night I get my
[53:11] computer and I go to typing it in oh I
[53:14] wipe the sweat off the brow of my face
[53:15] and I say y there it is word for word
[53:17] for word so the Holy Ghost knew what me
[53:20] in my head did know so he could speak it
[53:23] out of me and he come right back and say
[53:25] yep right there it is now watch
[53:28] this so he says he heard the words of
[53:31] God and he knew the knowledge of the
[53:33] most high which saw the vision of the
[53:37] almighty falling into a
[53:41] trance but having his eyes
[53:45] open now I put this down I want you to
[53:48] read this with me balam mention three
[53:52] sacred names of God God eel the powerful
[53:57] one the most high Elon the uplifted one
[54:03] and the allmighty Shady ey the Abundant
[54:08] one or the almighty one wow we would
[54:11] have been impressed impressed greatly if
[54:13] would have been s said where did he get
[54:15] this at how does he know this he's never
[54:19] been in one of our message services that
[54:21] we know of he's never tended to use
[54:24] convention he's from way and some other
[54:26] country but the spirit of God so had him
[54:29] under control he was prophesying the
[54:32] message of the hour and didn't even
[54:35] believe
[54:37] it is this phenomenal or what so I ask
[54:40] you if God could do this with a false
[54:43] prophet what about a man whose life is
[54:46] so surrendered to God and consecrated to
[54:49] God what about it young
[54:51] people now notice in numbers
[54:54] 24:17 I shall see
[54:57] him but not now I Shall Behold Him but
[55:02] not now listen
[55:05] this there shall come a
[55:09] star out of
[55:12] Jacob glory to
[55:14] God and a
[55:17] scepter shall
[55:19] arise out of Israel do you understand at
[55:22] the birth of the Lord Jesus the Magi
[55:27] this is the
[55:29] scripture brother Malachi that the Magi
[55:33] were looking to be
[55:35] fulfilled and it come through the
[55:39] mouth of a false
[55:45] prophet
[55:48] wow you said brother how can that be
[55:51] because God put that genuine gift there
[55:54] and God got that genuine gift so under
[55:56] control that man couldn't say nothing
[55:59] else he didn't even believe it he'd
[56:02] probably get so mad at himself he might
[56:04] smack yourself in the mouth I ain't
[56:06] saying that again yes you will cuz God's
[56:09] going to make you say it if God could do
[56:12] that for a man that don't even want to
[56:14] do it what about God's anointed servants
[56:17] I'm I'm talking about it's just us
[56:18] preachers that ain't even prophets if we
[56:21] pray and submit oursel to God can God
[56:24] use us to help his children and set him
[56:26] free and bring Deliverance to him this
[56:28] man don't even love the Lord this man
[56:31] don't even love Israel and God made him
[56:34] say
[56:35] it praise God there shall come a star
[56:40] out of Jacob and a scepter shall rise
[56:43] out of Israel and shall
[56:47] Smite the corners of
[56:50] Moab anybody know where he was at this
[56:53] time when the prophecy come forth aha
[56:55] you guess it right
[56:58] Moab so this went over real good at the
[57:01] convention didn't
[57:02] it wow so you're standing up there and
[57:05] you're prophesying against these very
[57:07] people and destroy all the children of
[57:13] shef wow literally in this Prophecy in
[57:17] the Hebrew there shall come forth a star
[57:20] out of Jacob the verb that this man used
[57:26] is in the prophetic
[57:30] past I want you to listen to what a
[57:33] realm this man broke into
[57:35] to it's as if so if if as if though this
[57:40] word was already come to pass prophetic
[57:47] history Lord
[57:51] God verse 18 and Edom shall be a
[57:54] possession see also shall be a
[57:57] possession for his enemies and Israel
[58:00] shall do
[58:02] valiantly out of Jacob shall come he
[58:06] that shall have dominion and shall
[58:08] destroy him that
[58:10] remainest of the
[58:14] city
[58:17] wow now I give let me give you another
[58:19] wow on top of that
[58:21] wow
[58:24] Joshua 13 ver
[58:27] 22 and balum also the son of
[58:31] beor the
[58:34] soothsayer did the children of Israel
[58:37] slay with the sword among
[58:41] them that were slain by
[58:46] them so here they are now on a
[58:49] war and the children of Israel killed
[58:52] this
[58:54] man that spoke these words
[58:57] words and they don't call him a prophet
[59:00] of God they call him a
[59:05] soothsayer you see what
[59:07] happened God updated the identity of
[59:13] this man now the people in that day May
[59:15] said hey man this this guy's a prophet
[59:17] he's a prophet but you see his Doctrine
[59:20] was
[59:21] wrong so you update the man's identity
[59:27] and they did and what they call him a
[59:31] soothsayer praise the Lord God forbid
[59:35] that any of our identity would be
[59:38] updated to be a blasphemer an unbeliever
[59:42] an Infidel amen no no I don't never want
[59:46] my identity to be updated into that I
[59:49] want my identity to be updated well he
[59:51] was standing there in one moment the
[59:53] next moment he disappeared he was gone
[59:56] that's the update I once said about me
[59:58] and
[59:58] you now notice in Joshua 249 then baac
[1:00:03] the son of zior King of Moab Rose and
[1:00:06] wared against Israel and sent and called
[1:00:09] balam the son of beor to curse you but I
[1:00:14] would not hearken unto balam now what
[1:00:16] God God is saying this is what I
[1:00:22] done therefore he blessed you
[1:00:26] still so I delivered you out of his
[1:00:32] hand you mean God can take a gift in a
[1:00:35] man's life that don't even believe what
[1:00:38] he's saying and would love to curse you
[1:00:41] and God said nope they're mine you ain't
[1:00:44] cursing my young ones what in the world
[1:00:46] does it matter to you as a matter of
[1:00:47] fact because you want to I'm going to
[1:00:49] make you bless them bless them bless
[1:00:52] them bless them and re bless them double
[1:00:54] bless them quarter off bless them I want
[1:00:56] you to prophesy about me coming down on
[1:00:58] the earth say it Lord I don't want to I
[1:01:01] never ask if you wanted to I told you to
[1:01:04] say it now say it he said I'll say it
[1:01:06] I'll say it I'll say
[1:01:09] it young people of our church if God
[1:01:13] could make a man like this said what
[1:01:16] about a prophet in the last
[1:01:21] days my Nehemiah 13:2
[1:01:26] after I started studying this brother
[1:01:28] Joe I thought yeah Lord I see why you
[1:01:30] want you wanted to illuminate us just a
[1:01:32] little bit more because they met not the
[1:01:35] children of Israel with bread and with
[1:01:37] water now this is what Moab would not do
[1:01:40] the children of Israel was in a real
[1:01:41] hard spot and the children of Moab had
[1:01:44] they had the opportunity to bless them
[1:01:46] and help them but they said no we're not
[1:01:48] doing it the children of Israel said
[1:01:50] look we'll buy it from you if if we can
[1:01:53] drink a little bit of the water from
[1:01:55] your creeks and your branches and
[1:01:56] whatever more and if you'll sell us food
[1:01:58] we're not asking for a handout if you'll
[1:02:00] just let us have it we'll buy it they
[1:02:02] say you ain't doing it get off of our
[1:02:04] property you bunch of Holy Rollers we
[1:02:06] don't want you around here and notice
[1:02:08] what God said because they met the
[1:02:10] children of Israel they met not the
[1:02:12] children of Israel with bread and with
[1:02:13] water but hired balum against them that
[1:02:17] he should curse them how be it our God I
[1:02:21] love it when God does this right here
[1:02:23] turn the curse in to a blessing praise
[1:02:28] God now look at Jude in the New
[1:02:32] Testament chapter 1: 11 woe unto them
[1:02:35] for they have gone in the way of
[1:02:38] Cain and ran
[1:02:41] greedily after the
[1:02:43] error not
[1:02:45] prophecy
[1:02:47] error of
[1:02:49] balum for reward Now watch how Jude
[1:02:54] separates his prophecy
[1:02:56] y from his
[1:02:59] error and perished in the gang saying of
[1:03:03] Kora Revelation 2:14 which is speaking
[1:03:06] to one of the church ages but I have a
[1:03:08] few things against thee because thou
[1:03:12] Hast there them that hold the
[1:03:17] doctrine of
[1:03:19] balum so so you mean
[1:03:24] balum had some
[1:03:27] Doctrine well what was it now God is
[1:03:31] rebuking this church age because they
[1:03:33] have some people there that were holding
[1:03:35] to the doctrine of balum balam's
[1:03:38] teaching notice it doesn't say balam's
[1:03:41] prophecy but balam's
[1:03:45] Doctrine now it goes on to describe what
[1:03:47] this Doctrine was I have a few things
[1:03:50] against the because th is there them
[1:03:51] that hold the doctrine of balum who
[1:03:54] taught
[1:03:56] baac to cast a stumbling
[1:04:01] block before the children of Israel
[1:04:05] oh now I
[1:04:07] see so after he got out from under the
[1:04:11] inspiration of God to speak by
[1:04:14] Vision then he got with baac and his
[1:04:17] rulers and said hey
[1:04:19] guys I know a way that y'all can still
[1:04:23] get to him God wouldn't let me say it
[1:04:25] under
[1:04:27] prophecy but here's my
[1:04:30] Doctrine here's my
[1:04:32] Doctrine now some of the Old Testament
[1:04:35] writers Josephus and some of the others
[1:04:38] say that actually what they taught them
[1:04:39] to do
[1:04:40] was that they had the women of Moab and
[1:04:44] they picked the most beautiful women
[1:04:47] that there were and they would set up
[1:04:50] like little booths and they would sell
[1:04:53] food and drink and things like that and
[1:04:57] then these women would start
[1:04:59] flirting with the sons of Israel now
[1:05:03] remember that was
[1:05:07] balam's Doctrine his prophecy was a star
[1:05:11] shall arise out of Jacob a scepter shall
[1:05:14] come out of Israel
[1:05:17] 100%
[1:05:19] accurate but it's
[1:05:22] Doctrine now having come through
[1:05:26] Pentecost as I did and some of you your
[1:05:28] families maybe
[1:05:31] did that was some of the things that
[1:05:34] bewildered me of course for years that I
[1:05:36] would see men call people out and tell
[1:05:39] them things and you've heard me share
[1:05:41] some of those things but yet see them do
[1:05:43] other things he say that can't be right
[1:05:46] that can't be right and then you'd hear
[1:05:49] them say prophecy of things a friend of
[1:05:53] mine was a song leader for AA Allen
[1:05:56] and a song leader for another
[1:05:59] man and he introduced this other man on
[1:06:02] the platform one night and a massive
[1:06:04] tent hundreds and hundreds of people
[1:06:07] there and whenever he turned the
[1:06:09] microphone over to this man and he come
[1:06:11] up on the platform and took it and he
[1:06:13] noticed the man was kind of
[1:06:17] Staggering and he smelt
[1:06:20] alcohol on the breasts of this famous
[1:06:23] preacher now this particular night was
[1:06:25] going to be a night he was really going
[1:06:27] to push for money and take an offering
[1:06:31] so whenever he would do that he had
[1:06:33] certain shoes that he would wear those
[1:06:36] shoes would have a hole in the bottom of
[1:06:38] them and he would have cardboard in the
[1:06:41] bottom of the shoe when he was preaching
[1:06:43] he'd throw his shoe up like that so you
[1:06:46] could see his
[1:06:47] shoe he would wear a suit that would
[1:06:50] have worn spots and holes in it and
[1:06:52] things like that and he would Point them
[1:06:54] out so you'd be able to see him so when
[1:06:58] when he would lift an offering you'd
[1:07:01] feel so sorry for him not knowing he was
[1:07:03] filthy
[1:07:05] rich so he gets up and on the platform
[1:07:08] and he's he's almost drunk can't hardly
[1:07:11] even walk takes the microphone talks a
[1:07:14] little bit and he said now it's time for
[1:07:17] God to vindicate his
[1:07:20] servant so there was a little girl there
[1:07:23] sitting up front he could see her
[1:07:26] crippled she had one leg that was 2
[1:07:29] inches shorter than another
[1:07:30] one so he made the challenge had the
[1:07:34] mother of the do the daughter to bring
[1:07:36] the little girl up this friend of mine
[1:07:38] stood right there and watched
[1:07:40] it he said he was always Reverend he'd
[1:07:43] always bow his head but he said he
[1:07:44] thought no no I'm going to watch this
[1:07:46] there's no way God is going to heal this
[1:07:49] child this man is nearly drunk and can't
[1:07:52] hardly walk
[1:07:55] he said brother Donnie told me this with
[1:07:57] tears in his eyes he said I stood right
[1:08:01] there and watched that baby's leg grow
[1:08:05] out to the exact same
[1:08:08] length as the other
[1:08:12] one of course the tent went
[1:08:15] wild then afterwards he lifted his
[1:08:19] offering of course you can
[1:08:23] imagine this brother so
[1:08:26] perplexed he' heard about brother
[1:08:28] brandham but he didn't really understand
[1:08:30] the
[1:08:31] message so he goes into a motel room
[1:08:34] this friend of mine checks himself in
[1:08:36] just going to stay and fast and and seek
[1:08:39] God gets down on his knees beside the
[1:08:41] bed and this was his prayer oh
[1:08:45] God if there is a
[1:08:48] God God have mercy on me help me what is
[1:08:54] truth this can't be right
[1:08:57] Lord and the spirit of God come into the
[1:08:59] room where he was and begin to tell him
[1:09:03] I sent a message in the last day I have
[1:09:06] sent a prophet called his name thank God
[1:09:10] for
[1:09:12] Mercy now notice
[1:09:14] balum understood enough about God to
[1:09:17] know that he wanted to curse these
[1:09:20] people but God wouldn't let him by
[1:09:23] prophecy
[1:09:26] so he said but there's another
[1:09:29] way if we can get them to compromise
[1:09:34] their
[1:09:35] self by their free moral
[1:09:37] agency and if they will do
[1:09:40] wrong they will cause God
[1:09:44] himself to turn against
[1:09:48] them and baac said
[1:09:51] wow this is what I wanted all along what
[1:09:55] do I do tell me what do I
[1:09:59] do cause these sons of
[1:10:02] Israel to begin to commit
[1:10:05] adultery with these moish
[1:10:10] women this is
[1:10:13] balam's Doctrine now you understand what
[1:10:15] was happening here in the church age was
[1:10:17] that some of the people of that church
[1:10:19] age were committing spiritual adultery
[1:10:23] with the churches and the doctrines and
[1:10:25] the beliefs and so on around them still
[1:10:28] recognized as the doctrine of bam hope
[1:10:30] you understand it the doctrine of balum
[1:10:32] is still alive today now watch this
[1:10:36] Doctrine will be displayed in Numbers
[1:10:37] chapter 25 and Israel Abode in chatim
[1:10:41] and the people began to commit
[1:10:43] whoredom with the daughters of Moab
[1:10:47] isn't it amazing that when Moses writes
[1:10:50] about this historically that he doesn't
[1:10:52] say it was through the teaching of the
[1:10:56] doctrine of balum so a man stands there
[1:10:59] and gets prophecy that is so perfect
[1:11:02] part of it's still coming to pass to
[1:11:05] this
[1:11:07] day but yet could teach
[1:11:10] things so
[1:11:13] damnable you understand how many people
[1:11:15] lost their
[1:11:17] lives because of
[1:11:20] this had there not been a priest that
[1:11:24] was faithful to God that would run and
[1:11:27] take a javelin and Pierce through the
[1:11:31] bodies of these
[1:11:34] people it's amazing because the blessing
[1:11:37] of God kept false prophecy away from
[1:11:40] them a man that looked at him and said I
[1:11:42] hate him a king looked at him and said I
[1:11:45] hate him and God said you ain't doing it
[1:11:48] I will not let you do it and Satan
[1:11:50] whispered to him hey make God do it
[1:11:54] himself
[1:11:57] that's what I did in the Garden of
[1:12:00] Eden I wanted the earth I wanted the
[1:12:03] paradise I tried to figure out a way to
[1:12:05] do it I couldn't get through to Adam I
[1:12:08] couldn't do it you know what I done I
[1:12:10] took his love for Eve and I twisted it
[1:12:13] right around against him I'm the one I
[1:12:16] made God do it I calls God out of his
[1:12:21] righteousness I talked even to doing it
[1:12:24] don't you know understand young people
[1:12:26] that's exactly the same thing the devil
[1:12:28] will try to do to
[1:12:29] us he'll try to get us disobedient to
[1:12:32] the word and cause the blessing of the
[1:12:34] Lord to leave our life why because we
[1:12:37] have this sacred special place with God
[1:12:40] and God cannot bless us in our sins oh
[1:12:44] my that's another
[1:12:46] subject oh my goodness
[1:12:49] watch so they begin to commit whoredoms
[1:12:53] now with the daughters of Moab
[1:12:56] and they called The People Under The
[1:12:59] sacrifices of their God so they
[1:13:01] worshiped Kos they worshiped all kinds
[1:13:04] of gods and many of the Canaanite
[1:13:06] religions they actually their idolatry
[1:13:08] was mixed in with sex acts so whenever
[1:13:10] they go to worship that actually have
[1:13:12] sex with a priestess or a priest at the
[1:13:15] temple it was Associated don't that turn
[1:13:18] look at me big eyed you'd be surprised
[1:13:20] how much it's still tied in around the
[1:13:22] church sex related stuff oh we're still
[1:13:25] bride we're still human beings but this
[1:13:27] is something we always have to watch
[1:13:31] praise the Lord so then what did they do
[1:13:34] they call the people under the
[1:13:35] sacrifices of their gods here goes them
[1:13:39] people that had received this wonderful
[1:13:42] word directly from God through this
[1:13:45] gift and through his
[1:13:48] teaching I'm emphasizing this for a
[1:13:50] reason listen to
[1:13:52] me separate his Doctrine from his
[1:13:57] prophecy and Israel joined himself into
[1:14:00] B peor and the anger of the Lord was
[1:14:04] kindled against
[1:14:08] Israel and we think it's terrible to
[1:14:10] have the devil mad at us that ain't
[1:14:13] nothing compared to God being mad at
[1:14:17] us chapter 31:1 16 behold these cause
[1:14:22] the children of Israel
[1:14:25] through the Council of
[1:14:28] balum to commit trespass against the
[1:14:32] Lord in the matter of peor and there was
[1:14:35] a plague among them oh my the
[1:14:40] congregation of the
[1:14:43] Lord so a plague from God struck the
[1:14:49] congregation of the Lord why listening
[1:14:52] to the wrong Doctrine
[1:14:55] oh my goodness taking them now tempting
[1:15:00] them to take the women of Moab to defile
[1:15:05] themselves from the laws of Separation
[1:15:09] that God said don't marry them don't do
[1:15:12] this now don't do it do you understand
[1:15:14] that same thing applies to us today that
[1:15:17] Satan is constantly trying to get us to
[1:15:19] merge either by things we do things we
[1:15:22] say things we watch or or getting around
[1:15:25] the wrong people and get us to break our
[1:15:29] vows of Separation sure love the people
[1:15:32] of the world love people that totally
[1:15:34] disagree with you but don't defile
[1:15:37] Yourself by trying to be so friendly and
[1:15:41] win them to the messeng or win them to
[1:15:43] the Lord that actually I've seen it
[1:15:45] happen over and over again the people
[1:15:47] with good intention oh I'm trying to
[1:15:49] witness to them I'm trying to witness to
[1:15:50] them and what do they do sew a great big
[1:15:54] basket full of of questions in the mind
[1:15:57] of that young person or a man or woman
[1:15:59] or whatever it is well have you ever
[1:16:00] thought about this hey have you looked
[1:16:02] at this hey have you checked that out
[1:16:04] have you questioned that have you looked
[1:16:05] at that and that person which went there
[1:16:07] to help them walks away with this great
[1:16:10] big mess in their head of questions
[1:16:12] about this that and the other why
[1:16:15] because flirting with the daughter of
[1:16:19] Moab oh my may God help us hey friends
[1:16:22] I'm not telling you just to do this this
[1:16:24] is what what I do as a preacher you see
[1:16:27] if I'm invited to go preach and I have I
[1:16:29] went and preached in seven Thunder
[1:16:31] meetings I went and preached in
[1:16:32] different meetings I didn't a bit more
[1:16:34] griev some people than nothing in the
[1:16:36] world and some of my brothers had
[1:16:37] criticize me for doing it by saying you
[1:16:39] know what I'm going to pray about if I
[1:16:41] feel let of the Lord to go I'm going to
[1:16:42] go because maybe God wants a witness
[1:16:44] there but if they approach me with their
[1:16:46] Doctrine I'm going to draw that line say
[1:16:48] hey pal I'm here to preach I'm not here
[1:16:50] to discuss this you and I disagree on
[1:16:52] this I don't want my vows of separation
[1:16:55] to the purity of this word to be defiled
[1:16:58] under the opes of kindness well I'm
[1:17:01] trying to reach out to this brother you
[1:17:02] know he's often air here but I'm trying
[1:17:04] no and I've done it before I've done it
[1:17:06] to where I'd go but I never do it unless
[1:17:08] I feel L the Lord and I've seen by God's
[1:17:11] grace some of those people I went to
[1:17:13] come out of that mess that they come to
[1:17:14] so thank God for that now watch behold
[1:17:17] these cause the children of Israel
[1:17:18] through the Council of balum to commit
[1:17:21] trespass against the Lord so what are
[1:17:24] they basically doing it's so simple get
[1:17:26] so profound defy the laws of Separation
[1:17:31] be friendly love show people Jesus but
[1:17:35] don't you start forfeiting what you
[1:17:37] believe don't lay your precious sacred
[1:17:41] things that God's given you on the altar
[1:17:45] of kindness and make it transitory that
[1:17:48] well you know now brother let me just
[1:17:50] tell you this and share this with you
[1:17:52] now I've got some questions now you
[1:17:53] understand what you're doing you're
[1:17:55] laying your sacredness your separation
[1:17:57] upon the altar sacrificing it for the
[1:18:00] element of peace and mutual
[1:18:03] understanding that's what they did now
[1:18:05] watch oh my now these are some of the
[1:18:08] things I want to ask
[1:18:10] you so did brother
[1:18:12] brandham teach us as his
[1:18:16] followers to commit
[1:18:20] adultery now let's
[1:18:22] judge our Prophet messenger
[1:18:27] okay testing one two this microphone's
[1:18:30] going out again testing one two I can
[1:18:33] hear myself but apparently y'all can't
[1:18:34] hear me weird did brother brandham teach
[1:18:39] us to commit adultery with the daughters
[1:18:42] of
[1:18:43] Moab
[1:18:46] what did Brother Brenham teach us to
[1:18:52] lie answer me please no no what about
[1:18:59] cheat to be
[1:19:02] dishonest what about killing
[1:19:05] people really okay what about live just

[1:19:38] difference between a man that will give
[1:19:40] prophecies and his Doctrine be totally

[1:19:57] in the Rapture and the Baptists are
[1:19:58] going in the rapture we really don't
[1:20:00] need the message to do all that you
[1:20:02] understand what they're doing they're
[1:20:03] offering their sacrifice of Separation
[1:20:05] upon the altar of compromise and saying
[1:20:08] well just well if that is so then there
[1:20:10] was no need for elaser to go all the way
[1:20:13] down there and be able to bring Rebecca
[1:20:15] back so God breaks his own type of
[1:20:18] Genesis
[1:20:20] 241 God should have just sent a big big
[1:20:22] text down there a big email and said
[1:20:24] anybody and everybody can go you don't
[1:20:26] have to listen to the message you don't
[1:20:28] have to say what the messenger said you
[1:20:30] don't have to pour the water out to the
[1:20:32] camels that's not even necessary just go
[1:20:34] ahead and do whatever you want to do
[1:20:35] just believe what you want to believe
[1:20:37] and live any way you want to live it's
[1:20:38] perfectly fine we're all going to heaven
[1:20:39] anyway no we're not and we share ain't
[1:20:42] all going in the
[1:20:43] rapture we all come by God's way or we
[1:20:47] don't
[1:20:49] go I heard a statement not long ago that
[1:20:51] Billy Graham had made and that Joel
[1:20:53] ostein and some of the these modern day
[1:20:55] preachers say that we're all going to
[1:20:58] heaven the pope said it just a few weeks
[1:21:01] ago three weeks ago the great Pope had
[1:21:05] said that Muslim Hindu Shinu all these
[1:21:08] things are all just different paths that
[1:21:13] lead us to the same place and I saw that
[1:21:16] and I
[1:21:17] thought I can agree with
[1:21:20] that but I'm not on that path probably
[1:21:24] you oh it's leading you all to the same
[1:21:26] place but you know what not in't my
[1:21:29] place Jesus never said I'm one of the
[1:21:31] ways but I am the way he didn't say I'm
[1:21:35] one of the truths I am the truth and no
[1:21:38] man can come to the father but by me but
[1:21:41] don't you see what it is the separation
[1:21:43] of the Bride is being offered on the
[1:21:46] sacrifice of compromise and so-called
[1:21:48] love oh brother Donnie we can't keep
[1:21:50] preaching this way we won't have nobody
[1:21:52] when we're done yes we will it ain't up
[1:21:54] to me to count the people it ain't up to
[1:21:56] me to fill up our church it's up to me
[1:21:58] to tell the truth and then God will get
[1:22:00] who he wants here we be the light let
[1:22:02] our light shine is that right am now
[1:22:06] watch let's move over can few more
[1:22:07] minutes before we close let's move over
[1:22:10] in the New Testament now and look at the
[1:22:12] realm of trance in the New Testament and
[1:22:16] it's Simon Peter and he became very
[1:22:20] hungry and would have eaten but while
[1:22:23] they made
[1:22:25] ready he fell into a trance so Peter's
[1:22:28] in a certain spot you never remember the
[1:22:30] the revelation of the Gentiles had not
[1:22:33] yet come into view so Peter was upon the
[1:22:37] Housetop and he he got really hungry and
[1:22:40] would have eaten and while they was
[1:22:42] fixing supper whatever it was he fell
[1:22:44] into a trance so again his eyes is wide
[1:22:47] open and it came to pass that when I was
[1:22:50] com again to Jerusalem Acts 22:17
[1:22:54] while I prayed in the temple I was in a
[1:22:59] trance now again not Peter but another
[1:23:02] servant of God the New Testament so does
[1:23:04] God still
[1:23:05] have the means of
[1:23:09] trance in the New
[1:23:11] Testament this is your new testament
[1:23:14] look at what the word trance means
[1:23:19] amazement
[1:23:21] astonishment a
[1:23:23] throwing of the mind out of its normal
[1:23:27] State being
[1:23:30] transported as it
[1:23:32] were out of himself though that in this
[1:23:39] wrapped look at how that's spelled r a p
[1:23:42] t which is the short form of
[1:23:47] rapture in this wrapped condition
[1:23:50] although he is awake his mind is drawn
[1:23:54] off from all surrounding
[1:23:57] objects and wholly fixed on things
[1:24:02] Divine now you see God knew in the last
[1:24:06] days there'd be so many
[1:24:09] interpretations of the Bible that we
[1:24:12] once again would need a return into this
[1:24:17] phenomenal Avenue now brother Rob and I
[1:24:20] was talking about it before we came
[1:24:22] over the Old Testament prophets we don't
[1:24:26] have near as much view of their life as
[1:24:29] what we had of brother Brandon we see
[1:24:31] Paul that we see his conversion then he
[1:24:34] disappears for three and a half years or
[1:24:36] so goes to Arabia when he comes back M
[1:24:40] right in all these great Epistles silent
[1:24:43] years of Paul's life we don't know
[1:24:46] hardly anything about the New Testament
[1:24:48] prophets what they did and all of that
[1:24:51] same of the Old Testament prophets God
[1:24:52] would give them a word they would stomp
[1:24:54] out of the Wilderness give that word
[1:24:56] from God stomp right back in the
[1:24:58] wilderness but in this day we have
[1:25:01] something unique something different so
[1:25:05] we have a man that is called by God to
[1:25:07] be a prophet but he doesn't start out
[1:25:11] like Paul did he doesn't start out like
[1:25:14] Ezekiel that he just runs right out the
[1:25:16] word of the Lord came unto me son of man
[1:25:19] saying and I saw the spirit of God on
[1:25:21] the river chear that's not the way it
[1:25:24] starts s and his first commission that
[1:25:26] God gave him was do the work of an
[1:25:32] evangelist so he starts praying for the
[1:25:34] sick going out preaching and he starts
[1:25:37] out with limited now please hear me he
[1:25:42] starts out with limited Revelation and
[1:25:46] understanding he doesn't start out with
[1:25:48] an opening of the seals in his first
[1:25:50] part phase of his ministry he starts out
[1:25:53] in the Baptist Church
[1:25:55] right well that don't bother me it shows
[1:25:58] me God's grace well he starts out
[1:26:01] believing this and this and this and
[1:26:03] there's things that God updated his
[1:26:07] understanding on he tells us that
[1:26:09] himself he used to believe the Virgin
[1:26:11] birth was one thing and he also used to
[1:26:14] believe that you know all kinds of
[1:26:15] things about diseases that were
[1:26:17] contagious and could be spread with all
[1:26:20] kinds of things in the message that's
[1:26:21] there and that's what's in the message
[1:26:25] but what do we see for our first time we
[1:26:28] get to see a servant of God grow from
[1:26:31] what he was to more understanding more
[1:26:35] understanding more understanding I'm
[1:26:37] glad myself I grew that same way and you
[1:26:41] all are going to grow the same way but
[1:26:43] now listen what we have the message
[1:26:47] which was first recorded in 1947 which
[1:26:50] is amazing to me because the very first
[1:26:52] quote in the message message faith is
[1:26:55] the substance 1947 is now the brothers
[1:26:57] have got some new gadgets now for
[1:27:00] recording that's the very first quote in
[1:27:03] the recorded
[1:27:05] message so what do we have well we have
[1:27:07] a man that started
[1:27:09] out and he had what was Revelation to
[1:27:13] him in 47 was Revelation in
[1:27:17] 65 but what was his understanding about
[1:27:20] certain things in 47 might have changed
[1:27:22] in 62 or 61 now I know I get hated I get
[1:27:27] persecuted I get run down people have
[1:27:30] said I blasphemed the Holy Ghost and
[1:27:31] everything else for saying such things
[1:27:34] as I said but look when I come to this
[1:27:36] message years ago I made up my mind I'm
[1:27:39] going to study it and I'm going to find
[1:27:41] out what he said so I'm not talking
[1:27:43] about me saying that he changed I'm not
[1:27:46] talking about comparing what he said to
[1:27:48] what I think I'm talking about comparing
[1:27:51] what he said to what he said
[1:27:54] and if he says I had this wrong then I'm
[1:27:57] going to be man enough to stand up and
[1:27:59] tell you he said that cuz you know what
[1:28:02] you're going to find it anyway if you
[1:28:03] listen to it so I want you to have the
[1:28:06] answer to the devil's question If he
[1:28:09] tries to put a doubt in your mind praise
[1:28:12] the Lord what what is that smell I'm
[1:28:14] smelling oh it's a devil's side I've
[1:28:16] smell that before Hallelujah I'm not
[1:28:18] afraid of those quotes are you all are
[1:28:21] you all afraid to read something where
[1:28:23] brother renham said I had that wrong for
[1:28:25] Years brother Brenham read the scripture
[1:28:28] in the Book of Revelation of the White
[1:28:30] Horse riter and he used that as his text
[1:28:34] to preach the sermon the mighty
[1:28:36] conqueror 1957 up through 60 or whatever
[1:28:39] it was over and over again and he
[1:28:42] identified that white horse rider as the
[1:28:45] Lord
[1:28:46] Jesus until the Seven Seals opened up
[1:28:50] and then you know what he realized it
[1:28:52] wasn't the Lord Jesus at all it was the
[1:28:57] devil can you imagine brother Malachi
[1:29:00] how he must have
[1:29:01] felt when he thought oh my Lord what
[1:29:04] have I
[1:29:05] done I've called the devil the Lord
[1:29:08] Jesus but that's what I love about his
[1:29:12] honesty and being able to stand up and
[1:29:14] say I was wrong and he says on the first
[1:29:17] seal I was going to make a horrible
[1:29:22] mistake you know what that horrible
[1:29:24] mistake was he had pulled out old notes
[1:29:27] of what he had preached in Revelation in
[1:29:30] the church ages and the 10 virgins and
[1:29:32] several many other places preaching that
[1:29:35] that white horse rider was the Lord
[1:29:37] Jesus and all of a sudden the word of
[1:29:40] God come open to him what was it young
[1:29:42] people a channel on the earth that had
[1:29:45] the ability of open vision and he looks
[1:29:48] by vision and he sees it's not Jesus
[1:29:53] it's the an Christ you imagine when he
[1:29:56] was standing there preaching maybe I'm
[1:29:58] thinking it's in waterl that might not
[1:29:59] have been where it was but he preaching
[1:30:02] he was talking about Adam and Eve in the
[1:30:04] Garden of Eden brother Jonathon and he
[1:30:05] said he he tells the people that night
[1:30:07] the next night after the service you can
[1:30:10] hear it in that night he sees it and he
[1:30:11] sees a vision and he actually saw in the
[1:30:14] Garden of Eden and he saw Adam and Eve
[1:30:17] walk out of the Garden of Eden and some
[1:30:19] great phenomenal thing happened there in
[1:30:21] that service and he'd come back to light
[1:30:22] the next service and he said he like to
[1:30:24] never got over that anointing because
[1:30:27] God let actually allowed him to see in
[1:30:29] the Garden of Eden what that sin was and
[1:30:32] he saw Adam and Eve walk out of that
[1:30:35] Garden of Eden don't you understand the
[1:30:37] word of the Lord in that way was lost to
[1:30:41] us we had no way of seeing it we could
[1:30:45] still read the Bible we'd still be
[1:30:47] trinitarians no telling where I'd be
[1:30:49] tonight no doubt still preaching cuz I
[1:30:51] love the Lord when I was in Pentecost
[1:30:53] but I still be messed up in my Doctrine
[1:30:56] my understanding of the godhead would
[1:30:57] still be wrong I'd still be so wrong in
[1:31:00] so many things but thank God for a man
[1:31:03] that had the gift from God to bring open
[1:31:06] vision and teach us what to live like
[1:31:10] Devils teach us to hate everybody that
[1:31:12] don't agree with us that's not what we
[1:31:15] believe and you'll notice these
[1:31:16] defectors when they leave the message
[1:31:18] what do they do they're doing the exact
[1:31:21] same thing baac wanted B them to do look
[1:31:25] at their backside tell all this false
[1:31:28] and tell this and tell that why don't
[1:31:30] you tell the good things that happen
[1:31:31] Among Us you lying
[1:31:34] Devils well praise the Lord come on tell
[1:31:37] that oh sure they say well I'll tell you
[1:31:39] one thing I heard so and so done this
[1:31:41] yeah but you'd like for us to unveil
[1:31:44] some of your trash I know some things
[1:31:46] about some of these people that have
[1:31:48] left the message I know some things
[1:31:50] about some of those that have left our
[1:31:51] church too I could ru Jo them in five
[1:31:55] minutes
[1:31:58] time but you see I'm not a trash
[1:32:02] Mouse and that's not what this message
[1:32:04] teaches me to do it teaches me to love
[1:32:07] them and pray for them and feel sorry
[1:32:11] for
[1:32:13] them everybody
[1:32:18] stand praise the
[1:32:20] Lord how many he appreciates the
[1:32:23] prophecy of the message of the last days
[1:32:26] how many also appreciates the doctrine
[1:32:29] of how it tells us how to live what to
[1:32:32] do does it tell us to hate our enemies
[1:32:35] of course not does it tell us to be able
[1:32:38] to reveal secrets about them now let me
[1:32:41] tell you something as a pastor there's
[1:32:43] lots of things I know about lots of
[1:32:45] people including preachers who's been at
[1:32:48] our church uhhuh I could tell some
[1:32:51] things about some of the preachers that
[1:32:53] I know of too but you know what I'm not
[1:32:57] here to do that I'm here to love him
[1:33:00] pray for him and what do I get that I
[1:33:02] get it first of all because I'm born
[1:33:04] again from the spirit of God that's the
[1:33:06] way my master taught me now this is one
[1:33:10] thing you want to ask yourself and
[1:33:12] people try to come to you and pull you
[1:33:14] away from the word or put questions in
[1:33:17] your mind this is what I asked them so
[1:33:20] how long has it been since your wife
[1:33:23] thought you were literally
[1:33:29] Jesus do people who traveled with you
[1:33:33] deacons in your church people in your
[1:33:37] church mistook you for the Lord
[1:33:44] Jesus testing one two brothers we I
[1:33:46] check out this microphone have
[1:33:49] church that tells me something about the
[1:33:52] man of God of this
[1:33:56] age can you imagine some of his own
[1:33:58] family
[1:33:59] members thought he was the Lord Jesus
[1:34:03] now if there's anybody that knows us
[1:34:06] it's our
[1:34:07] families boy some of the things you you
[1:34:09] you young people could tell me about
[1:34:11] your mamas and daddies you can start one
[1:34:14] by one after
[1:34:18] church have any of you lately had a hard
[1:34:20] time distinguishing your daddy from
[1:34:22] Jesus
[1:34:24] what about your mama bless her
[1:34:28] heart and yet they want to tell you and
[1:34:31] they want to point out this and that and
[1:34:33] the other whenever we have a man with
[1:34:35] such a Ministry that many thought it was
[1:34:38] the Lord Jesus himself putting on
[1:34:41] another human
[1:34:43] Veil now we ridiculed and we know it's
[1:34:46] totally wrong to believe such a thing
[1:34:48] but think about what made them believe
[1:34:51] that
[1:34:53] because there was so much like him can
[1:34:56] you imagine you're
[1:34:57] fishing and he tells the brothers
[1:34:59] brothers let's leave here and we'll go
[1:35:02] around this bend over there and we'll do
[1:35:04] such and such and when we get there you
[1:35:07] will catch three I'll you'll catch five
[1:35:10] you'll catch this and we'll do this and
[1:35:12] they'll weigh this and measure this I've
[1:35:14] talked to men who had that to happen to
[1:35:18] them you see it's real easy for people
[1:35:20] to criticize and make up all these
[1:35:23] things because a lot of these
[1:35:24] eyewitnesses are
[1:35:27] gone yeah they do the same thing about
[1:35:30] our lord Jesus too and you imagine
[1:35:33] you're sitting there and they tell you
[1:35:35] you went to a doctor and you walked up
[1:35:37] three steps going up into your house
[1:35:39] you're from Chicago your house is 303 Mr
[1:35:43] so and so I see you you you picked up a
[1:35:46] glass yesterday afternoon as you was
[1:35:48] washing your dishes and you dropped the
[1:35:50] glass on the ground and you got a
[1:35:52] nervous Condition it's called by so and
[1:35:54] so and you say Lord have
[1:35:57] mercy Lord have mercy what in the world
[1:36:00] where'd that come from that's wonderful
[1:36:02] and great but once that happened what
[1:36:05] did he tell us how to live what was
[1:36:09] William brandom's Doctrine and when
[1:36:11] people tell you I've left the
[1:36:14] message I want to know what that
[1:36:19] means because in the message we believe
[1:36:23] your by the grace of God through
[1:36:27] faith so does that mean they've left
[1:36:30] that we believe you repent and you're
[1:36:33] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:36:34] you receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:36] that's what the message people
[1:36:39] believe we believe in the coming of the
[1:36:41] lord we believe in angels we believe in
[1:36:44] demons we believe in Heaven We Believe
[1:36:47] In Hell pick up your amens we believe in
[1:36:49] all the good things of God and we
[1:36:51] rewarded by God so when people say
[1:36:54] they've left the message does that mean
[1:36:56] they've left all of that we believe
[1:36:58] every word in the Bible so does that
[1:37:00] mean when they say I've left the message
[1:37:03] so you mean they're leaving the Bible
[1:37:05] too well it's apparent some of them have
[1:37:06] because some of them that's left the
[1:37:07] message they got went back and got rebap
[1:37:10] tized back in titles again as a matter
[1:37:12] of fact some of the preachers that have
[1:37:13] stood used to stand in the message and
[1:37:15] preach the message are now
[1:37:18] infidels there's been one that sited our
[1:37:20] church and preached several years ago a
[1:37:22] younger man burned up the country for a
[1:37:25] while him and his wife was was way laid
[1:37:28] by somebody who didn't believe the
[1:37:30] message now they're total infidels
[1:37:36] agnostics my goodness oh young people
[1:37:40] hold to what you've got hold to what
[1:37:43] you've
[1:37:44] got and what does it teach them let me
[1:37:47] tell you one thing if I was looking for
[1:37:49] something else and I ain't for these
[1:37:52] people that's trying to convince to
[1:37:53] leave the message all I got to do is
[1:37:56] look at them and think are you kidding
[1:37:58] me you're the worst advertisement the
[1:38:00] devil could ever send my way I mean full
[1:38:03] of hate full of oh my goodness some of
[1:38:06] the people that I've dealt with that
[1:38:07] have left the message and they say
[1:38:09] they're free I think y free from
[1:38:11] morality free from Common Sense free
[1:38:13] from decency that ain't what I want that
[1:38:16] ain't what I want I want to be more like
[1:38:19] Jesus I want to be so much like him
[1:38:23] don't you young people and where do we
[1:38:25] get that at because that's what we are
[1:38:28] taught God bless you let's
[1:38:32] pray Lord Jesus I thank you tonight
[1:38:35] father for this time we could spend
[1:38:39] together I thank you Lord for helping me
[1:38:42] not to stop on this the last time we had
[1:38:45] these
[1:38:47] questions Lord sometimes I I guess it's
[1:38:50] just me I think Lord they they may be
[1:38:52] getting bored with
[1:38:54] maybe but help me that I can just follow
[1:38:58] you and I know it'll always be
[1:39:00] [Music]
[1:39:02] right Lord God I thank you for the
[1:39:05] prophecy of this last
[1:39:07] day I love the discernments I love
[1:39:09] hearing those
[1:39:11] things but Lord I also love
[1:39:14] hearing about how we ought to
[1:39:17] live I'm convinced that all these people
[1:39:19] that left the message never did really
[1:39:22] listen to that many
[1:39:25] tapes because they would they would know
[1:39:27] the man they're
[1:39:29] describing is not the man that's on them
[1:39:33] tapes if they have heard many of them a
[1:39:35] lot of them will resort to reading
[1:39:37] because reading will compliment more the
[1:39:41] intellect but father we thank you that
[1:39:44] we have the recorded voice so we can
[1:39:46] hear his
[1:39:47] Simplicity we can hear his
[1:39:51] sincerity we can hear him weep with we
[1:39:53] can hear him tell us about his
[1:39:57] failures Lord coming to this message
[1:40:00] here in just just a week or
[1:40:04] so oh
[1:40:08] Hallelujah it'll be my
[1:40:10] anniversary of preaching of my
[1:40:13] introducing the message in
[1:40:17] 1983 here I am 42 years in preaching it
[1:40:22] and Lord it didn't make me fall in love
[1:40:24] with brother Brandon it don't make me
[1:40:26] want to be like him and he's my goal but
[1:40:30] it made me love you more than ever
[1:40:33] before oh Jesus it's not just brother
[1:40:36] Brandon we want to see and we do but
[1:40:39] it's you we want to
[1:40:41] see it's you we're getting married
[1:40:44] to it's you that's going to sit on the
[1:40:47] throne it's you that saved us it's you
[1:40:50] that healed us it's you it's the love of
[1:40:54] our
[1:40:55] life thank you
[1:40:57] Father there was something about it when
[1:41:00] I first started hearing the tapes that
[1:41:02] mesmerized me it was the way he talked
[1:41:06] to you and the way he talked about you I
[1:41:10] actually learned how to
[1:41:13] pray in a more clear more uniform way
[1:41:18] after I come to the message cuz in
[1:41:19] Pentecost I have to be honest I was so
[1:41:23] afraid of
[1:41:25] you it was the ministers that I heard
[1:41:28] preached they instill that in
[1:41:31] me this Prophet didn't bring more fear
[1:41:33] to me but more
[1:41:36] love and I've never loved you more than
[1:41:40] I love you here
[1:41:42] tonight cuz Falling In Love With Jesus
[1:41:46] was the best thing I ever
[1:41:50] done and now Lord I say I want to be

[1:41:55] been oh we worship you tonight

[1:42:03] reaching out to others and trying to
[1:42:05] witness to always find and know that
[1:42:08] delicate spot to where we do not
[1:42:11] compromise or
[1:42:12] sacrifice our truths our
[1:42:15] Separation on the altar of
[1:42:19] compromise oh we worship you Lord maybe
[1:42:23] always be ready to share of what you've
[1:42:26] done but always be so
[1:42:30] sharp we'll be wise as serpents harmless

[1:48:31] have something that's pulling a desire
[1:48:34] to that God has allowed me to hear the
[1:48:36] one true voice and it's his voice it's
[1:48:39] he used brother Brandon brother Brandon
[1:48:40] was the voice behind the voice our
[1:48:42] prophet and I'm just thankful that God
[1:48:45] has allowed me to recognize
