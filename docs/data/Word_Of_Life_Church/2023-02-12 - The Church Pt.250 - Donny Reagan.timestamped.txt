[44:04] God bless you to stand together
[44:11] some of the funniest things can happen
[44:13] in church can't you
[44:15] but we are not defeated today
[44:17] amen
[44:19] First Kings chapter 19 verse 1.
[44:23] last Sunday we closed out with Elijah
[44:25] calling fire down out of heaven
[44:29] killed in a whole bunch of prophets
[44:31] God manifesting himself in such a
[44:34] supernatural way
[44:36] today
[44:38] would like to look at after that great
[44:41] victory
[44:42] First Kings 19 1.
[44:46] an Ahab told Jezebel
[44:49] all that Elijah had done
[44:52] which was calling fire out of Heaven
[44:55] killing the false prophets and then of
[44:58] course he called rain down after the
[45:01] fire
[45:02] it was all how he had slain all the
[45:05] prophets with the sword
[45:08] then Jezebel sent a messenger
[45:10] unto Elijah's saying so let the Gods
[45:16] she believed more than one
[45:18] due to me and more also if I make not
[45:23] thy life
[45:24] as a life of one of them by tomorrow
[45:28] about this time
[45:30] in other words you've got 24 hours to
[45:33] live
[45:36] now once you notice this next verse and
[45:39] when he saw that
[45:42] I find this verse amazing because
[45:45] of the way that the writer writes it
[45:48] when he saw that not when he heard it
[45:51] but when he saw it
[45:54] you see whenever you and I will hear
[45:57] something from the Devil
[45:59] and it becomes so real to us we start
[46:02] seeing it we're in trouble
[46:05] the devil tell you you're defeated you
[46:07] can't make it you go to sin it yourself
[46:09] you better pull back and say Lord help
[46:12] me readjust my vision
[46:14] and when he saw that he arose and went
[46:18] for his life
[46:21] and came to Beersheba which belonged us
[46:25] to Judah and left his servant there
[46:30] but he himself won a Day's Journey Into
[46:34] the Wilderness and came and sat down
[46:37] under a juniper tree
[46:39] and requested for himself
[46:42] that he might die
[46:45] which is so peculiar
[46:47] because he run for his life
[46:51] and now he's wanting God to take his
[46:52] life
[46:54] what a state we get in
[46:56] when we get down spiritually
[47:00] and said it is enough now O Lord
[47:04] take away my life
[47:07] for I am not better
[47:10] than my father's now remember there was
[47:13] a total of
[47:15] 850 Prophets
[47:18] there were 450 which was of the male
[47:22] deity that the Canaanites and Ahab
[47:26] worshiped which was Baal b-a-a-l
[47:31] there was another 400 prophets which was
[47:35] of the female deity
[47:38] astarting or Venus
[47:41] she was supposed to be the wife of Baal
[47:45] now Ahab had a divided home because he
[47:48] worshiped Baal which was idolatry of
[47:50] course and his wife Jezebel worshiped
[47:54] Authority or Venus now what's sad about
[47:58] this is Ahab was a Jew
[48:02] but what's easy to see who was the boss
[48:05] of the house
[48:07] Jezebel was
[48:09] just pray together
[48:12] father we love you today we thank you
[48:14] for your grace to us Lord and your mercy
[48:16] and
[48:16] we ask you Lord Jesus that you would
[48:19] help us as we look into your word today
[48:23] father May ever Spirit be captivated by
[48:27] the presence of God
[48:29] we rebuke the devil which is already
[48:31] tried to hinder us but he ain't
[48:34] hindering us
[48:36] Lord God I pray that every heart would
[48:38] be open to your word today may we be
[48:42] arrested as it was in the presence of
[48:46] God
[48:47] May the Holy Ghost come I pray and
[48:49] Minister the word as only you can do
[48:52] help me to get out of the way Lord Jesus
[48:56] to step aside that you can use that part
[48:59] of yourself which you placed in me
[49:02] speak to us father we ask in Jesus name
[49:05] amen God bless you you may be seated
[49:12] I like the way Spurgeon quoted this
[49:15] situation about Elijah
[49:18] he said that Elijah retreated before
[49:22] a defeated enemy
[49:25] retreated before a defeated enemy
[49:31] when God's servants get out of the will
[49:35] of God
[49:36] they are liable to just about do or say
[49:40] anything
[49:41] it's incredible how that a man like this
[49:46] just a few hours before this morning
[49:50] stood in the presence of God and saw the
[49:54] miraculous like we've never read about
[49:56] it before By Any Man
[49:59] see what God did and yet at the threat
[50:02] of one woman
[50:04] one woman
[50:07] he gets tore all two pieces
[50:10] it's like he forgets everything God has
[50:13] just done
[50:14] and all the other things God has done
[50:17] prior to this
[50:19] and he gets so beside himself
[50:23] that he don't know what to do
[50:26] and he begins to thinking and saying
[50:28] things that don't even make sense
[50:31] now I'm not here so much today to
[50:34] criticize Elijah but to bring Elijah's
[50:38] life sorted down to our own sometimes
[50:42] and it's amazing when the people of God
[50:45] get to this kind of state that they will
[50:49] become so vulnerable in some of their
[50:52] strongest and greatest points now a man
[50:56] like this Elijah of course was a great
[50:59] courageous man a man Fearless with God
[51:03] a man that would stand up against all
[51:06] these prophets and not just stand
[51:09] against them verbally but take a sword
[51:11] and kill 450 of them and one slaying
[51:16] and face the potential of meeting the
[51:19] army of Ahab
[51:21] and do all of that without one shaking
[51:25] or quivering of his faith but yet now
[51:28] Something's Happened you know I found
[51:31] the same thing in the life of Abraham
[51:33] and the life of David and the life of
[51:36] others I'm sure us as well Abraham one
[51:40] of his greatest strong points was his
[51:43] faith but when Abraham got weak in faith
[51:47] and went down in the land of Egypt the
[51:50] very thing that was his strengths became
[51:53] his very stumbling block
[51:55] David which was a man of great songs and
[51:59] all that yet great David's greatest
[52:01] strength was not his singing it was not
[52:04] his musical ability it was his Integrity
[52:08] David was a man of such integrity
[52:12] and yet as we've been looking at the
[52:15] life of Bathsheba it was through this
[52:18] his greatest strengths that David become
[52:22] so vulnerable
[52:24] his Integrity then waned away and
[52:27] vanished he becomes a liar a trickster a
[52:31] deceiver is that right Moses switched
[52:34] the Bible says in the Book of Numbers
[52:36] was the meekest man on the face of the
[52:39] earth a man so Meek and so humble and a
[52:44] man of such a tender Spirit but yet he
[52:47] got into such a state that he turned
[52:50] into a man with such a temper that he
[52:54] lost his temper and actually had to
[52:57] Forfeit his right to going into the
[53:00] Promised Land
[53:01] I wonder sometimes if Satan don't take
[53:04] advantage of us in those times of our
[53:07] strengths and we say oh this will never
[53:10] happen to me I'm so strong my strength
[53:13] is this and this and this and I will
[53:16] never fall to that oh but how Satan
[53:20] loves to hear us brag about such
[53:24] I think of Peter in the New Testament
[53:26] another man of such courage yet his
[53:30] courage failed and he denied that he
[53:33] even knew the Lord Jesus
[53:35] no doubt he felt so strong I will never
[53:39] forsake you it makes no difference oh
[53:42] John he's a weakling and Thaddeus he's
[53:45] this and that and James the great he's
[53:47] this and the others but Lord I'll tell
[53:49] you one thing I'll never do it if
[53:52] anybody will stand by you it will be me
[53:55] and the very thing he bragged about was
[53:58] the very place he fell
[54:02] like Peter Elijah was a bold man
[54:07] a man of great strengths and a man of
[54:10] great courage
[54:11] and yet we see a phenomenon here before
[54:15] us
[54:16] now this happened in the country of
[54:19] Jezreel the valley of Jezreel where the
[54:21] battle of Armageddon will actually take
[54:24] place not too long from today
[54:27] and Elijah has confronted all these
[54:31] false prophets the 400 knew better than
[54:34] to show up the 400 of us starting they
[54:37] never even came but he killed the 450 of
[54:41] Baal
[54:42] and I imagine that there was so much
[54:44] blood shed that it run Plum off the
[54:47] place there when you look down from the
[54:49] valley of Jezreel and you look up the
[54:52] the highest place there facing north you
[54:56] face what is called Elijah's cave it was
[55:00] actually there that Elijah came out and
[55:02] stepped on the top of that high place
[55:04] there and there's where the altar was
[55:07] and where he defeated baal's false
[55:10] prophets
[55:11] but he hears this reply from Jezebel and
[55:17] the Bible tells us there he decided to
[55:20] leave so where does he head he's going
[55:23] to head to Beersheba now Beersheba is
[55:26] the most southern part of the land of
[55:29] Israel it was under a different King if
[55:33] you know your Bible by this time you
[55:34] know that the Kingdom of Israel has
[55:37] become divided in two parts so to have a
[55:41] king over one part of Israel and a king
[55:44] over another part of Israel which is
[55:46] called Judah now it just so happens that
[55:49] Elijah is under the Dominion of Ahab
[55:53] which is the king over Jerusalem and the
[55:55] northern part of the Kingdom so what he
[55:57] decides to do is he's going to run and
[56:00] he's going to leave and go to the
[56:02] southern part bear Sheba is 95 miles 95
[56:07] miles from Jezreel where he's just obey
[56:11] made God and done this great miracle 95
[56:14] miles now he knows he has about 24 hours
[56:18] now unlike you and I couldn't pick up
[56:21] his cell phone and call Uber he cannot
[56:24] pick up and get a a plane ticket down
[56:26] there or a bus the only thing that he
[56:28] had basically was his feet now I want
[56:31] you to think this man takes off at such
[56:35] haste that he arrives the next day and
[56:40] runs 95 miles
[56:43] now I want you to think of the anxiety
[56:46] and the fear and the trauma and all that
[56:50] he's going through now he's so nervous
[56:52] he's so beside himself he don't know
[56:55] what to do and the anointing has now
[56:59] left him now you and I can relate to
[57:01] that a little bit we know how it is when
[57:03] we get in the presence of God and
[57:04] wonderful things happen and all boys
[57:07] sometimes it don't even wait till Monday
[57:09] morning sometimes it hits you Sunday
[57:11] afternoon and the spirit of God don't
[57:13] seem like it's nowhere around you and
[57:15] you don't know what to do well it would
[57:17] be even more personified of course than
[57:19] a man like this so he didn't rest on his
[57:22] way so he takes off and he must have
[57:25] been at a very rapid Pace in order to
[57:28] make this journey of 95 miles now
[57:30] Jehoshaphat was the king of Judah
[57:33] Jehoshaphat was a good man he loved the
[57:36] Lord and yet but he knew that there was
[57:39] a weakness about Jehoshaphat and that
[57:42] was that he had made so Lord of an
[57:44] allegiance with Ahab so whenever he gets
[57:47] down there the Bible tells us that what
[57:49] Elijah did was he left his servant so
[57:53] him and his servant take on running and
[57:55] they go heading right toward the South's
[57:57] land and they arrive in Beersheba so
[58:00] when he gets there the Bible says that
[58:02] he leaves his servant there now I want
[58:04] you to notice as he's going along the
[58:07] journey he is deteriorating as he's
[58:09] going in his mind he's deteriorating in
[58:13] his strengths he's deteriorating he's
[58:16] hungry because this is one of the first
[58:17] things that God tells the angels to do
[58:20] is give him something to eat so
[58:22] apparently he took off at such a rapid
[58:24] rate he's running running can you
[58:26] imagine now you're running so fast you
[58:28] run 95 miles 95 miles I've been on this
[58:32] track myself and it's nowhere like
[58:35] Interstate 26 or a lot of our country
[58:37] here but up and down and around and up
[58:40] and down 95 miles from there and they
[58:43] take off in this journey now when they
[58:45] get there he's still he's under this
[58:48] thing and he's entered into a deeper
[58:50] state of this depression so he comes to
[58:54] a spot to where that he realizes now
[58:56] there's only one man that knows where I
[58:58] am and that is my servant so he decides
[59:02] to leave the servant there he doesn't
[59:05] even trust him no longer you know this
[59:07] is something when we get down and we get
[59:10] weary and we go to fight and all kinds
[59:13] of things and one of the first things
[59:15] that Satan wants to do is begin to
[59:17] isolate us from other people people that
[59:20] we love people that love us and convince
[59:23] us really you can't trust anybody
[59:28] now what makes that more real is because
[59:31] we've all been betrayed by people have
[59:34] we not we've been betrayed by friends or
[59:36] have been betrayed by a family member
[59:38] sometimes betrayed by preachers or
[59:41] people that you have confidence in and
[59:43] whenever something like that happens you
[59:45] can't get over it overnight I don't care
[59:47] who you are so Satan then will bring
[59:50] that back whenever you're in a state
[59:52] like Elijah was in so he doesn't feel
[59:55] like that he can even trust his servant
[59:57] so he leaves him there and then the
[1:00:00] scripture tells us he goes on a little
[1:00:03] further now actually where he's going to
[1:00:05] go he's going to go into the Negev
[1:00:07] Desert now he's going into that spot
[1:00:09] which you've never been there or never
[1:00:11] seen places like it it's a very
[1:00:13] incredible place has its own Beauty but
[1:00:16] yet it has deaths everywhere you look at
[1:00:18] it it's absolutely a place of dryness
[1:00:21] hardly no trees no plants whatsoever and
[1:00:25] dry there hardly any rain at all hardly
[1:00:27] nothing to eat and here heads the
[1:00:30] prophet because now he Ventures 15 more
[1:00:33] miles so now he's run 95 miles within a
[1:00:37] 24-hour period and he takes off again I
[1:00:40] trade gobs his servant and he's got 15
[1:00:42] more miles and he just goes deeper and
[1:00:45] deeper and deeper into this dry Barren
[1:00:49] spot how many has ever been there
[1:00:51] spiritually oh yeah we've all had our
[1:00:53] negative desert have we not
[1:00:55] now I want you to notice now in verse 4
[1:00:58] that he himself went a Day's Journey
[1:01:01] Into the Wilderness and came and sat
[1:01:04] down under a juniper tree now here he
[1:01:07] comes and he finally arrives 15 more
[1:01:10] miles into the Wilderness and he fills
[1:01:12] up by now he's safe I'm okay they won't
[1:01:15] be able to find me now and I'll be able
[1:01:17] to get there so he sees this juniper
[1:01:19] tree or as it's called in the Hebrew a
[1:01:21] broom tree now broom tree which would
[1:01:23] have white types of leaves which would
[1:01:26] be able to reflect this Mediterranean
[1:01:28] Sun it was also a place to where he
[1:01:31] could be able to refresh himself and
[1:01:34] think but he looks around he has no
[1:01:36] water he has no food he has no company
[1:01:38] so he's all by himself now whenever he
[1:01:41] gets to here I want you to listen now
[1:01:43] the prophet of God of this day which
[1:01:46] says the spirit of Elijah on him tells
[1:01:49] us what happens to Elijah the prophet is
[1:01:51] that he goes into a nervous breakdown
[1:01:54] now he he's already feeling all of this
[1:01:58] threat and all of this pressure and no
[1:02:01] doubt this had been accumulating for a
[1:02:03] long time it would be almost impossible
[1:02:05] for a man to have a nervous breakdown
[1:02:07] just going from a well State and within
[1:02:11] 24 hours having a nervous breakdown so
[1:02:14] more than likely it was the work and the
[1:02:17] load and the responsibility that was
[1:02:19] building up on this man and after this
[1:02:22] he felt like he was a failure because
[1:02:25] God had come down in a great way and he
[1:02:29] felt like apparently in his heart that
[1:02:31] the whole nation would now turn back to
[1:02:33] God and everybody's going to look around
[1:02:36] and say oh what God did what a great
[1:02:38] thing well there's no way anybody else
[1:02:40] could do that Bale couldn't do it Venus
[1:02:42] asteroth I thought he could not do that
[1:02:45] no other gods of the heathens could do
[1:02:47] such a thing and he must have been sort
[1:02:49] of like Jonah was when he felt like God
[1:02:52] is going to do a great thing and when it
[1:02:55] didn't not happen it must have seemed
[1:02:58] like a total failure because it was as
[1:03:01] if though what God had done meant
[1:03:04] absolutely nothing now we've never seen
[1:03:06] anything like that since is that right
[1:03:09] it's never been done quite like that
[1:03:11] since but it was like the he looked
[1:03:14] toward the miracle and he had something
[1:03:17] else in mind that the miracle is going
[1:03:19] to lead to the Revival of the whole
[1:03:22] nation but it didn't instead of leading
[1:03:24] to the Revival of the whole nation it
[1:03:27] turned them more against him and when
[1:03:29] Ahab goes home and tells Jezebel and the
[1:03:32] messenger comes back and tells Elijah
[1:03:34] now it seems like he's a complete
[1:03:37] failure which is one of the worst things
[1:03:39] any of us can feel like now whether you
[1:03:42] are a preacher whether you are a
[1:03:44] housewife or a husband or a child
[1:03:47] whatever you are if you're an
[1:03:49] electrician if you're a builder to feel
[1:03:51] like that you are a failure and want
[1:03:54] your called to do it's one of the
[1:03:56] greatest disappointments any of us can
[1:03:58] have so if you're already under the
[1:04:01] stress of that load your sisters that
[1:04:03] are Housewives and God bless each of you
[1:04:05] forgiving of yourself to your husbands
[1:04:08] and your children and you'll have a
[1:04:10] great reward one day you are very very
[1:04:13] very looked over in the day we're living
[1:04:15] because uh with laodicea the women who
[1:04:18] are the most I don't you know adored and
[1:04:20] all that lifted up in this age are those
[1:04:22] women who have some sort of great you
[1:04:25] know degree in college and their their
[1:04:27] women professionals and this and that
[1:04:30] and the other oh a great achievement is
[1:04:32] going to be achieved today before the
[1:04:35] Super Bowl will ever start uh the pilots
[1:04:38] that are going to fly over over by with
[1:04:40] the Navy Plains all of them will be
[1:04:43] women and All America feels like women
[1:04:46] are finally rising to their place they
[1:04:49] could have no higher place than what God
[1:04:52] gave them in the beginning
[1:04:54] but yet this is the way we think why
[1:04:56] because our nation is Anointed with that
[1:04:59] dominant thing that the women will be
[1:05:01] the leader in the last day this is why
[1:05:03] they will accept Jezebel spiritual to be
[1:05:06] their head and yet women then that are
[1:05:09] Housewives most of you women I don't
[1:05:11] figure will ever find F-35 or an F-22 or
[1:05:15] you'll never be out there glory to God
[1:05:17] throw in your long hair back working on
[1:05:19] a jet engine no most of you sisters
[1:05:22] probably the only kind of Grease you're
[1:05:23] ever going to have between your fingers
[1:05:24] is not ancient Greece it's going to be
[1:05:27] from cooking muffins and chicken and
[1:05:28] fried taters and stuff like that so in
[1:05:31] the eyes of the world then you all are
[1:05:33] nobodies you're nothing well let me tell
[1:05:35] you something that's absolutely alive
[1:05:37] from the pits of Hell God could give you
[1:05:40] no greater position than to be a woman
[1:05:43] and to be a housewife if that's so
[1:05:45] designed of God's purpose don't you let
[1:05:47] the feminism of this age make you sinful
[1:05:50] you are nothing because you will stand
[1:05:53] there that day of the Lord Jesus will
[1:05:55] reward you with a great reward
[1:05:58] is that right well while we're at it
[1:06:00] let's just go ahead brothers and give
[1:06:02] our sisters a nice hand
[1:06:05] I thank God for every daughter of God
[1:06:07] around the world they're a great
[1:06:09] treasure
[1:06:10] but we can see then what one woman in
[1:06:13] the hands of the devil does so here he's
[1:06:16] in the Negev Desert he's all by himself
[1:06:18] no one there around him and he finally
[1:06:21] goes into this state he feels like a
[1:06:23] failure his work has been so difficult
[1:06:26] for years and then the Bible says he
[1:06:29] requested for himself that he might die
[1:06:32] now look at where he's at he's just
[1:06:34] completed this journey of 95 miles
[1:06:37] overnight and a day and he's run till
[1:06:39] he's absolutely wore out and now he
[1:06:42] drops his servant off to anybody Sheba
[1:06:44] and he heads off another 15 miles he's
[1:06:47] already exhausted he's warned till he
[1:06:49] don't know what to do he's nearly beside
[1:06:51] himself and he was running for what
[1:06:53] running for death he was running for his
[1:06:57] life to be saved right then after he
[1:07:00] gets to Bear Sheba what does he do he
[1:07:02] said God I don't want to live no longer
[1:07:04] well what in the world did you just run
[1:07:06] over a hundred miles for if you don't
[1:07:09] want to live no longer look at how we
[1:07:12] can become when we get so stressed out
[1:07:15] that we don't even make sense
[1:07:18] well don't sit there and look at me
[1:07:19] funny y'all know what I'm talking about
[1:07:21] he said is it enough is it enough now oh
[1:07:25] Lord take away my life for I am not
[1:07:28] better than my father's now from this
[1:07:30] statement it would make you wonder if
[1:07:33] Elijah began to sink too highly of
[1:07:37] himself
[1:07:38] now I want you to notice this statement
[1:07:40] take away my life oh Lord for he says I
[1:07:44] am not better than my father so who told
[1:07:46] him that he was where did he get this
[1:07:50] idea that he was better than his
[1:07:53] father's now he's confessing he is not
[1:07:56] so you see he flees from death and now
[1:08:00] he prays for death it's the combination
[1:08:04] of emotional burnout
[1:08:08] emotional burnout and stress and the
[1:08:13] pressure of being a man in this office
[1:08:15] and feeling like that he's a total
[1:08:18] failure and I'll tell you one thing if
[1:08:20] we ever get to that spot we are in
[1:08:22] Dangerous Ground this is why people take
[1:08:25] their lives because they feel like their
[1:08:28] what their life is absolutely wasted so
[1:08:31] look at him he's in he's in total
[1:08:34] burnout he's feeling and experiencing a
[1:08:38] weariness which he's never felt before
[1:08:40] on top of that the man is so hungry he
[1:08:44] can hardly even go now you can imagine
[1:08:46] you're running running you don't think
[1:08:48] they even take no no food with you you
[1:08:50] got to get out there and you got to run
[1:08:52] fast and he's burned up all this energy
[1:08:54] running all night long and all day and
[1:08:57] then he drops him off his servant in
[1:08:58] Beersheba and he takes off another 15
[1:09:01] miles can you imagine any of us running
[1:09:03] that far that's a joke I imagine some of
[1:09:06] us if we run three would be calling
[1:09:08] McDonald's we'd be called an Uber
[1:09:10] everybody else bring me some food bring
[1:09:13] me some food I can't make it no longer
[1:09:15] is this journey over how far are you I'm
[1:09:18] a thousand yards from the church come
[1:09:19] and get me I can't make an old father
[1:09:21] now you can imagine all of this
[1:09:24] accumulation of this stuff together so
[1:09:27] he's got emotional burnout and he's
[1:09:30] weary he's so exhausted and the man is
[1:09:33] basically starving to death and he has
[1:09:36] no no water that we know of and then he
[1:09:39] has this deep sense of failure deep
[1:09:43] sense of failure and then he let's just
[1:09:47] be honest he has a lack of faith
[1:09:49] something has now happened from that
[1:09:52] great miracle to where he thinks God
[1:09:55] will not take care of him now if you
[1:09:57] look at it really he there's no better
[1:09:59] place he could be than in the valley of
[1:10:02] Jezreel in the will of God you're better
[1:10:05] off in the valley of Jezreel facing the
[1:10:07] army of Ahab and the army of Jezebel
[1:10:10] then you are to be under oh my a juniper
[1:10:13] tree out in the middle of nowhere and
[1:10:16] not having faith to believe God can move
[1:10:18] for you
[1:10:19] so here he is he's also dealing with the
[1:10:22] lack of faith well let's just go ahead
[1:10:24] and be honest whenever we hear a bad
[1:10:26] report from the doctor or we look at
[1:10:29] something in a negative way and we begin
[1:10:30] to say oh no oh no will God move for me
[1:10:33] will it not oh god oh no God what are
[1:10:35] you going to do what are you dealing
[1:10:37] with you're dealing with Satan trying to
[1:10:39] battle your face and convince you that
[1:10:42] God won't do it this time he's done it
[1:10:44] before and he's done it for others but
[1:10:45] he won't do it for you and what are you
[1:10:47] battling a lack of faith well I'm not
[1:10:50] sure will he do it well I know he can oh
[1:10:53] sure if you've seen him do much you know
[1:10:55] he can't but do you know he will for you
[1:10:58] you see most of us Satan will not battle
[1:11:00] us can God do it we've seen him do so
[1:11:04] much that's even Beyond question is it
[1:11:06] not we know we can heal the sick we know
[1:11:09] it can heal cancer we've seen him do it
[1:11:11] we've seen him perform Miracle after
[1:11:14] Miracle but what is him when it comes
[1:11:16] right down to it will he do it for me
[1:11:21] oh my
[1:11:22] so here he is
[1:11:24] and now he has a nervous breakdown
[1:11:28] notice in verse 5 and as he lay and
[1:11:31] slept under a juniper tree behold then
[1:11:34] an angel touched him
[1:11:38] and said unto him arise and eat
[1:11:42] can you imagine as he lays there and
[1:11:45] he's shaking and quivering and maybe he
[1:11:47] can't even talk and he's he's in a
[1:11:50] terrible terrible state
[1:11:51] crying lamenting
[1:11:54] thinking all types of thoughts I I want
[1:11:57] to die I don't even want to live no more
[1:12:00] I have nothing to live for
[1:12:03] I failed God I failed God's people
[1:12:06] maybe it was about this time he realized
[1:12:09] by what he had done he had made the
[1:12:12] situation worse
[1:12:14] because now he's going to appear
[1:12:17] to his church
[1:12:19] as if though he is a running coward
[1:12:24] oh it must not have hit him near as
[1:12:26] realistically as it did till he got
[1:12:28] under the juniper tree and I realized
[1:12:30] this what did I just do
[1:12:33] I cannot believe I have done this
[1:12:36] I have run from Jezebel
[1:12:40] I I defy the army of Ahab I killed 450
[1:12:44] prophets by myself with a sword that had
[1:12:47] to take Supernatural strength of one man
[1:12:48] against 450.
[1:12:51] but then when the anointing leaves him
[1:12:53] and the only thing that gets on his mind
[1:12:54] is just run just run
[1:12:58] don't raise your hands but I wonder how
[1:13:00] many of you whenever you face trials and
[1:13:02] things
[1:13:03] as I said don't raise your hand but I
[1:13:06] wonder how many of you have
[1:13:07] contemplating getting in your car
[1:13:10] and starting it and never coming back
[1:13:14] never look back
[1:13:19] and what's amazing is you really have no
[1:13:21] plan where you're going
[1:13:22] well where are you going you're going to
[1:13:24] Estes Park and you know you're going
[1:13:25] where are you heading you're heading
[1:13:27] down to uh Florida where are you going I
[1:13:29] don't know I'm just I'm just out of here
[1:13:31] don't you see where you are
[1:13:33] don't you see where you are y'all you
[1:13:35] just got to leave so the thing is run
[1:13:37] where do we get that at
[1:13:40] because that's the way our father felt
[1:13:42] in the Garden of Eden
[1:13:44] when he fell and he didn't know what to
[1:13:47] do so the thing is just run away
[1:13:51] run away
[1:13:54] just run and run from your problems but
[1:13:57] you won't run away from your problems
[1:13:59] you'll be taking them with you
[1:14:02] now you might run from your wife from
[1:14:04] your children from the boss and this and
[1:14:05] that and the other but all them thoughts
[1:14:07] and all them issues they're right in
[1:14:09] here and they're right up here and
[1:14:12] they're in your spirit and they're in
[1:14:14] your thought pattern now you imagine
[1:14:16] what he gets down there and then it hits
[1:14:18] him and I chose it what have I done
[1:14:21] my Ministry is ruined
[1:14:25] well all the church all the elect of God
[1:14:27] if there's any of them left he even got
[1:14:29] that low there can't be a saved person
[1:14:32] left I'm the only one dear God only me
[1:14:39] it's amazing how we get so
[1:14:41] self-righteous in it
[1:14:44] ah even I I'm the only one left
[1:14:48] oh my
[1:14:51] but there's one thing I love about our
[1:14:54] father
[1:14:56] even though no doubt the light of this
[1:14:58] was self-inflicted to the Prophet Elijah
[1:15:01] maybe the Lord warned him over and over
[1:15:04] again you're getting too tired
[1:15:06] you're getting too worn
[1:15:08] you're getting weary
[1:15:10] better take a break
[1:15:12] no I'm good I'm good
[1:15:15] I'm strong
[1:15:17] look at me Lord I'm strong you better
[1:15:20] take a break
[1:15:21] better take a day off
[1:15:24] no that's a sign of weakness I don't
[1:15:26] need a day off Hallelujah I'm the mighty
[1:15:29] Elijah
[1:15:31] now the mighty Elijah is laying under a
[1:15:34] tree shaking like a leaf in the Wind
[1:15:37] no food no water
[1:15:39] no desire
[1:15:41] to even live
[1:15:45] you probably saw it as he felt sleep
[1:15:48] coming over him I hope I don't even wake
[1:15:51] up
[1:15:53] I hope to God
[1:15:55] I don't even wake up
[1:15:59] because I do not
[1:16:01] want to live another day
[1:16:04] I'm a failure
[1:16:07] and now I've kept it all off
[1:16:09] I run
[1:16:12] how in the world can I ever hold my head
[1:16:14] up again before God's people
[1:16:17] I'm a complete ruination
[1:16:20] I'll never preach again
[1:16:23] or maybe you're a housewife I'll never
[1:16:26] make another bed I'll never make another
[1:16:28] pancake
[1:16:30] I'll never do I can't stand it no more
[1:16:32] I'm such a failure
[1:16:38] all this has been
[1:16:41] heard in another dimension
[1:16:45] and father has a great delegation
[1:16:48] that is being gathered
[1:16:51] to go down to the Negev
[1:16:55] and they're being dispatched to meet at
[1:16:58] the juniper tree
[1:17:01] father says
[1:17:02] I want the angel
[1:17:05] with the softest hand
[1:17:08] to go down first
[1:17:11] and I want the best cook
[1:17:15] that there is among you
[1:17:17] I mean those God's got angels that know
[1:17:19] how to cook
[1:17:21] I want the angel that can cook the best
[1:17:26] I want this one I want that one
[1:17:29] I want you to go down and attend
[1:17:33] my prophet
[1:17:35] now let me just tell you today the Lord
[1:17:37] God still has those angels around with a
[1:17:40] soft touch
[1:17:41] if you're needing to touch today from
[1:17:43] his presence
[1:17:46] and he lay and slept under a juniper
[1:17:48] champion oh then an angel
[1:17:52] s
[1:17:54] so the angel with the softest touch
[1:17:58] just reaches over and touches him now
[1:18:01] you imagine father saying don't alarm
[1:18:03] him
[1:18:04] he's in such a state it could terrify
[1:18:08] him
[1:18:09] it could absolutely send him into a
[1:18:12] stroke or a heart attack
[1:18:14] Because he believes he's out here by
[1:18:16] himself in the middle of nowhere
[1:18:20] so the angel gently
[1:18:24] gently
[1:18:28] wake up
[1:18:30] Elijah
[1:18:32] dear beloved one of God
[1:18:36] wake up
[1:18:40] what is it
[1:18:44] it's okay
[1:18:46] it's okay
[1:18:48] I'm sent from the presence of God
[1:18:51] to tell you
[1:18:52] he's heard your cries
[1:18:56] Hallelujah
[1:19:00] then the other Angel is already there
[1:19:04] the best cook
[1:19:06] and he comes
[1:19:08] brings him what looks like something
[1:19:10] that is so simple
[1:19:14] and he says arise and eat and he looked
[1:19:16] and behold there was a cake
[1:19:19] bacon on the coals
[1:19:21] so this Angel also knew had a lot of
[1:19:23] Fire
[1:19:24] and you imagine a lie Elijah's laying
[1:19:27] their soul wound up in this if you
[1:19:30] notice it I'm sure that many times some
[1:19:31] people get so depressed
[1:19:34] they don't feel like getting out of bed
[1:19:38] many of them don't feel like getting
[1:19:40] dressed
[1:19:42] they don't feel like combing their hair
[1:19:45] Lord God use me this morning father I
[1:19:47] pray
[1:19:52] they don't feel like grooming themselves
[1:19:54] or taking care of themselves
[1:19:57] they just don't care anymore
[1:20:01] so while he's there the angel builds a
[1:20:05] fire and he's right there near him
[1:20:07] any
[1:20:09] he sees there was a cake bacon on the
[1:20:12] coals and a cruise of water at his head
[1:20:16] and he didn't eat
[1:20:17] and drink
[1:20:19] and laid him down again
[1:20:22] now the angel packs all kinds of
[1:20:25] vitamins
[1:20:27] in this corn cake
[1:20:30] you say how do you know it was corn
[1:20:32] because Elijah this day said it was
[1:20:34] corny ought to know
[1:20:38] so he packed all types of vitamins and
[1:20:40] nutrients and minerals and protein and
[1:20:43] carbs and all these things that his body
[1:20:46] needed
[1:20:48] because a man wasn't just finding a
[1:20:50] spiritual battle he was finding a
[1:20:52] natural body you know what as well as I
[1:20:53] do that when people get under a great
[1:20:55] load many times they lose their appetite
[1:20:58] and you can see it on their face their
[1:21:01] face speaks volumes that they're just
[1:21:03] not themself
[1:21:05] if they had a smile a certain smile they
[1:21:08] will still put on a certain smile all of
[1:21:10] us are still actors and we can act to a
[1:21:14] certain degree that everything was all
[1:21:15] right but the ACT smile is not the same
[1:21:18] as the true smile they act laugh and
[1:21:22] they act giggle it's not the same as the
[1:21:25] true one come on the ACT amen and the
[1:21:29] ACT Clapping Your Hands and the acts
[1:21:31] praising the lord it's not the same as
[1:21:34] the real one
[1:21:39] so they wake him up and he finally gets
[1:21:41] up and he he grabs a cruise of all and
[1:21:44] he or water rather he just still he just
[1:21:46] kind of adults in the means of person
[1:21:49] poor Feller
[1:21:50] bless his heart look at him
[1:21:53] I ain't never seen him like this before
[1:21:56] he's an awful shape that ever was
[1:21:59] poor guy
[1:22:01] so maybe they're helping me you just
[1:22:04] shake it
[1:22:05] he did
[1:22:07] here here
[1:22:09] let me help you
[1:22:15] so we're going to stick in that corn
[1:22:16] cake
[1:22:24] I can't talk I don't
[1:22:26] I don't feel like talking no no that's
[1:22:28] okay Elijah
[1:22:30] you don't need to talk
[1:22:32] just lay back down
[1:22:34] just say back down
[1:22:36] we'll be here with you
[1:22:39] we'll watch over you
[1:22:41] you're no longer
[1:22:43] alone
[1:22:45] Hallelujah
[1:22:47] you were no longer alone
[1:22:53] and he did eat and drink
[1:22:55] and laid him down again
[1:22:59] and the image of the Lord came again the
[1:23:01] second time
[1:23:02] and touched him and said arise
[1:23:06] and eat I want you to notice the
[1:23:07] difference in this verse in verse 5. the
[1:23:10] first verse 5 he just tells him arise
[1:23:12] and eat but this time he adds a little
[1:23:13] more to the message and he says because
[1:23:16] the journey is too great for thee isn't
[1:23:19] it amazing that an angel of God but only
[1:23:21] say these words arise and eat three
[1:23:24] words
[1:23:25] he didn't want to startle him he didn't
[1:23:26] want to shake him he's so torn up that
[1:23:29] he can only comprehend even so much word
[1:23:32] he can only only comprehend so much love
[1:23:35] and care I find this so phenomenal that
[1:23:38] we as human beings can get so tore up
[1:23:40] and so apart from the reality of the
[1:23:43] love of God that God gently has to
[1:23:46] remind us again I love you
[1:23:48] I care for you
[1:23:50] I died for you I come to set you free
[1:23:54] and he knows sometimes if he gives it to
[1:23:57] you too much we're just going to
[1:23:58] automatic shutdown emotionally we're so
[1:24:01] burnt out we just can't even take the
[1:24:04] good
[1:24:05] oh Lord
[1:24:08] but this time the angel says arise and
[1:24:10] eat and then he says because the journey
[1:24:13] is too great
[1:24:15] fuzzy
[1:24:17] and he rose and did eat and drink and
[1:24:19] went in the strengths of that meat
[1:24:24] 40 days
[1:24:26] and 40 nights
[1:24:28] unto Horeb
[1:24:30] the Mount of God
[1:24:33] from Beersheba to Horeb
[1:24:35] there's 145 miles
[1:24:39] walking
[1:24:42] of course I don't know
[1:24:44] but this time after he got all these
[1:24:46] corn cakes he might have been flying a
[1:24:49] little bit every now and then
[1:24:51] you might have just been hitting the hot
[1:24:53] spots on the Negev Desert
[1:24:56] can you imagine a man being able to eat
[1:24:59] Glory
[1:25:01] too little
[1:25:03] corn cakes
[1:25:05] and on the strengths of them corn cakes
[1:25:09] able to go for 40 days and 40 nights
[1:25:14] I want you to notice here
[1:25:17] in verse 9 and he came thither into the
[1:25:19] cave and lodged there and behold the
[1:25:21] word of the Lord came to him and he said
[1:25:24] unto him what do us thou hear
[1:25:27] Elijah
[1:25:31] I'd like to ask you that this morning
[1:25:35] what are you doing here
[1:25:38] not in this building
[1:25:40] but where you are in your walk was God
[1:25:44] if you're in this depressed state what
[1:25:47] are you doing there
[1:25:50] Jesus never purchased just depression
[1:25:53] for you
[1:25:54] Jesus never purchased sadness for you
[1:25:57] and gave you sadness as part of your
[1:26:00] inheritance as a believer
[1:26:03] what are you doing here
[1:26:05] so sad so just but I've failed him I've
[1:26:09] messed up joined the crowd
[1:26:13] our church this morning has hundreds and
[1:26:15] hundreds of people in it who's failed
[1:26:18] him who's messed up who's let him down
[1:26:21] who's let down their friends their
[1:26:23] family well anybody here besides me down
[1:26:25] there
[1:26:28] so what do a style here Philip
[1:26:32] what do us thou here Greg
[1:26:41] what you notice brother Branham says it
[1:26:43] this way Elijah
[1:26:45] had a breakdown
[1:26:47] when he was under the juniper tree
[1:26:50] John had a breakdown in the prison
[1:26:53] he was a high-pitched Prophet them
[1:26:55] nerves on edge and his Eagle Eye
[1:26:59] filmed over
[1:27:00] little Elijah's heart was broke
[1:27:03] any Minister knows what Monday morning
[1:27:06] is after a hard day on Sunday
[1:27:08] compare that you Preachers Wives you
[1:27:10] know how your husband is on Monday
[1:27:12] morning after he's preached hard two or
[1:27:15] three times Sunday so worn out what do
[1:27:17] you think about Portillo Elijah there he
[1:27:19] was no one to comfort him and he stopped
[1:27:22] under this gender petrainian knelt down
[1:27:24] and he looked up to God and said Lord
[1:27:27] I'm so tired and so weary why don't you
[1:27:30] just take my life and let me go my
[1:27:32] father's all went so let me go men who
[1:27:36] deal in the Supernatural who stay on the
[1:27:38] presence of God and when you see God's
[1:27:41] program turned down
[1:27:44] and you preach it and you try your best
[1:27:49] and you do everything that God tells you
[1:27:51] to do and still
[1:27:54] they walk away from it
[1:27:58] it's heartbreaking
[1:28:02] it's heartbreaking
[1:28:05] he said a poor little fella skinny
[1:28:07] laying there gray hair hanging over his
[1:28:09] shoulder God said my servant needs some
[1:28:12] rest God's mercy to his servant
[1:28:15] he just laid him down on a bunch of
[1:28:18] weeds and he went to sleep I'd imagine
[1:28:20] there was 10 000 angels
[1:28:24] watching him sleep
[1:28:26] there was one Assurance a Believer has
[1:28:28] though the world turned him down yet God
[1:28:31] loves him the world may call you a Holy
[1:28:33] Roller they may call you fanatic but if
[1:28:36] you're true to God there's one sure
[1:28:38] thing God loves you and his angels are
[1:28:42] encamped about those who fear Him
[1:28:46] oh Hallelujah
[1:28:50] I'd imagine on every limb all around to
[1:28:54] the place of swarms of angels and God
[1:28:56] came down and said not poor little tired
[1:28:59] servant he's so nervous and so tore up
[1:29:02] he don't know what to do
[1:29:04] I want to pick out the angel here that's
[1:29:07] got the softest hands don't you scare
[1:29:10] him
[1:29:12] Hallelujah
[1:29:14] walk over and stroke his brow write easy
[1:29:18] and I want the best cook among you
[1:29:22] you go up there and get all the vitamins
[1:29:24] you can find
[1:29:25] and put in this corn meal
[1:29:29] the world's turned him down oh my
[1:29:33] but I'm going to treat him right
[1:29:35] Hallelujah that means praise our God
[1:29:37] don't get scared of that
[1:29:39] bring forth the best that we got to cook
[1:29:42] him a corn cake and set him down some
[1:29:45] water and this soft handed Angel went
[1:29:47] over and stroked a little servant of God
[1:29:50] on the brow
[1:29:53] remember if you've done your best God's
[1:29:56] still got those angels in order
[1:29:58] he loves you just the same as he loved
[1:30:02] Elijah now either we believe that
[1:30:05] statement or we don't I choose to
[1:30:09] believe it I believe God loves me just
[1:30:12] as much as he did Elijah I believe God
[1:30:16] loves you but brother Donnie I failed
[1:30:18] him and so did Elijah and so have I and
[1:30:21] so did Moses and so did Peter and so did
[1:30:24] every other person that's ever served
[1:30:26] him you're going to fall and make
[1:30:28] mistakes and fall short of the glory of
[1:30:30] God but the question is what are you
[1:30:32] going to do when you mess up you're
[1:30:34] going to lay down there and wallow in
[1:30:36] yourself pity or are you gonna rise and
[1:30:39] say Lord forgive me and try me one more
[1:30:42] time Lord forgive me for my mistakes
[1:30:45] forgive me for my failures try me once
[1:30:49] more Lord
[1:30:50] try me
[1:30:56] Elijah rubbing his eyes raising up his
[1:30:59] little frail
[1:31:00] shaking hands
[1:31:03] take a hold of the bread needed just the
[1:31:06] great Angelic choir
[1:31:08] come down and formed a little panoramic
[1:31:10] around him like that and begin to sing
[1:31:13] the Psalms like no mother
[1:31:16] could cool her baby to sleep
[1:31:19] let him seep again the father turned
[1:31:21] around and said you know I love him so
[1:31:23] much and the Journey's great he's got a
[1:31:25] lot to go through yet I'm not through
[1:31:27] with him so I must feed him again so he
[1:31:30] called the angels and dumped in another
[1:31:31] big bundle of vitamins I believe God
[1:31:35] still got that bundle of vitamins today
[1:31:37] don't you
[1:31:38] and cooked up another corn cake and set
[1:31:42] him a cruise of water and stroked his
[1:31:43] brow and fed him again I'm so glad that
[1:31:46] there is a juniper tree when we get all
[1:31:49] war and tore up we can go under that
[1:31:53] juniper tree and find spiritual vitamins
[1:31:56] to travel any kind of trip

[1:35:29] look at what David said in Psalm 61 1.
[1:35:34] to the chief musician upon Nagina
[1:35:37] a Psalm of David
[1:35:39] You're My Cry Oh God
[1:35:41] attend unto my prayer
[1:35:44] from the end of the Earth While I Cry
[1:35:46] unto thee
[1:35:47] when my heart
[1:35:50] this overwhelmed
[1:35:52] and the word overwhelmed means to turn
[1:35:55] aside to envelop oneself
[1:35:59] to be feeble faint
[1:36:02] or grow weak when my heart is
[1:36:05] overwhelmed
[1:36:07] Or Glory
[1:36:09] somebody Lead Me To The Rock
[1:36:12] that is higher than ours you notice
[1:36:15] David didn't say get that by himself hey
[1:36:16] but he said lead me if I may know
[1:36:19] sometimes we need to be led sometimes we
[1:36:22] just gets so weak and so feeble that we
[1:36:25] don't know what to do and we thank God I
[1:36:27] don't know I don't know a way out of
[1:36:28] this situation I don't know what to do

[1:36:31] seem like everything I've tried to do
[1:36:33] has been a failure well somebody lead me
[1:36:36] out of this place and let me tell you
[1:36:37] today God don't just use preachers to
[1:36:39] leave those weak and sick among us
[1:36:42] sometimes a word from a lay member just
[1:36:44] an encouraging text and encouraging
[1:36:47] something on Instagram if you're going
[1:36:49] to use social media why don't you use it
[1:36:51] for the benefit and the glory of God
[1:36:53] instead of a place to hang out your
[1:36:55] dirty laundry and the trash of your
[1:36:57] family and all the things that people
[1:36:59] are going through come on now use it for
[1:37:02] the glory of God let people know you're
[1:37:04] a Christian let people know you don't
[1:37:06] delve and the garbage of this world but
[1:37:09] you're going to use every means
[1:37:10] available to witness to somebody about
[1:37:13] not only this saving power but they
[1:37:16] encouraging power use your Instagram
[1:37:18] account as a way to share a corn cake

[1:37:25] piece of corn cake it might be
[1:37:27] somebody's sad I'm the problem somebody
[1:37:29] would preach with me this morning and

[1:37:48] foreign
[1:37:48] oh
[1:37:51] David goes on to say for thou has been a
[1:37:54] shelter
[1:37:56] for me
[1:37:57] and the Strong Tower
[1:38:00] from the enemy
[1:38:02] I will abide in thy Tabernacle forever I
[1:38:06] will trust in the comfort
[1:38:08] of thy wings
[1:38:11] Salah
[1:38:12] Psalms 142 2 I poured out my complaint
[1:38:17] before him I showed him before him I so
[1:38:22] notice I showed before him my trouble
[1:38:25] when my spirit
[1:38:27] was overwhelmed
[1:38:30] Within Me
[1:38:32] then thou knowest my path
[1:38:35] in the way we're in
[1:38:38] I walked have they privately laid a
[1:38:40] snare for me
[1:38:41] I looked on my right hand and beheld and
[1:38:44] there was no man that would know me
[1:38:46] Refuge failed me no man cared for my
[1:38:50] soul I mean it's ever been there oh it's
[1:38:53] one thing I love about the Psalms they
[1:38:55] are more one the most powerful books in
[1:38:57] the Bible as far as victory but when it
[1:39:00] comes down to just relating to humanity
[1:39:02] and the things you go through you know
[1:39:04] some preachers preach Christianity as if
[1:39:07] though you should never have a trial
[1:39:08] that's a line preacher
[1:39:10] a preacher that tells you you're going
[1:39:11] to be on the Mountaintop all the time
[1:39:13] it's not telling you the Full Gospel I'm
[1:39:15] telling you you're going to fight Devils
[1:39:17] you're going to fight hell you're going
[1:39:19] to fight disease you're going to fight
[1:39:20] trouble but the good thing about it is
[1:39:22] you can win amen you can win by the
[1:39:25] grace of God you're not going to get a
[1:39:27] reward if you don't fight and we must
[1:39:30] fight greater than ever before all hell
[1:39:32] has broke loose against the people of
[1:39:34] the last day we can feel it out on the
[1:39:36] world I just heard it this week on the
[1:39:38] news that they are so alarmed the
[1:39:40] psychiatrists and psychologists because
[1:39:42] the increase of mental illness and
[1:39:45] sickness has attacked the Young
[1:39:47] Generation and there's an increase of
[1:39:49] over one-third compared to what it was
[1:39:52] two years ago and the doctors are so
[1:39:55] concerned because suicide has raised but
[1:39:58] I rebuke that suicide devil from amongst
[1:40:01] our people in the name of Jesus take
[1:40:04] your leave from the saints of God we
[1:40:08] have everything to live for we have
[1:40:11] everything to fight for we're not
[1:40:13] survivors but we are more than
[1:40:16] conquerors than him who gave himself for
[1:40:19] us we have a corn cake called Christ
[1:40:22] Jesus and we will win there is
[1:40:27] oh Hallelujah there is no devil that can
[1:40:32] defeat us
[1:40:34] oh
[1:40:36] Hallelujah
[1:40:37] [Applause]
[1:40:41] ah
[1:40:43] foreign
[1:40:49] I said Thou Art my refuge
[1:40:52] and my portion
[1:40:54] in the land of the living
[1:40:56] attend unto My Cry
[1:41:00] for I am brought very low
[1:41:03] deliver me from my persecutors
[1:41:07] for they are stronger than I
[1:41:11] bring my soul
[1:41:13] out
[1:41:15] of prison
[1:41:17] that I may praise thy name
[1:41:20] the righteous shall Compass me about now
[1:41:23] watch his Faith's confession
[1:41:26] you see some people still struggle
[1:41:29] and trying to understand the balance
[1:41:33] of talking Faith talk
[1:41:36] and they seek
[1:41:38] that if you say well how you doing
[1:41:41] I'm good I'm fine
[1:41:43] everything's well
[1:41:45] that's your faith and language
[1:41:48] but is there anything wrong with telling
[1:41:50] them when you get in pain look what you
[1:41:52] remember I'm sick today
[1:41:53] I need help I I need prayer today people
[1:41:56] are afraid to even request prayer on
[1:41:59] such things because they think they're
[1:42:01] that's a negative testimony that's not a
[1:42:03] negative testimony
[1:42:05] your testimony is by his stripes I'm
[1:42:07] Healed but I need a little bit of help
[1:42:10] to get from point A to point B I'm
[1:42:12] dragging my leg I'm a little bit sad I'm
[1:42:14] a little bit depressed would you pray
[1:42:16] for me but what's your confession My
[1:42:18] Confession is by Stripes I'm already
[1:42:20] healed My Confession is I am more than a
[1:42:23] caucus of him that loved him or
[1:42:25] Hallelujah I am more I'm going to come
[1:42:28] right out of this Valley and I'm going
[1:42:30] to lift my hands and praise the Lord but
[1:42:32] until the manifestation hits me would
[1:42:35] you pray for me
[1:42:39] hallelujah
[1:42:41] hallelujah
[1:42:42] oh but David says I will be compassed by
[1:42:47] the righteous I may be feeling low today
[1:42:50] I may be hungry I may be weary I may be
[1:42:53] shaken under the juniper tree but I
[1:42:55] ain't going to stay here alone because
[1:42:57] Mount Horeb is calling me you remember
[1:42:59] what Mount Horeb was it's what almighty
[1:43:02] God met Moses and my whole Hallelujah
[1:43:04] Elijah had that inkling if he could go
[1:43:07] back to where the Prophet had his
[1:43:09] experience maybe he could have his I
[1:43:11] don't want to point you today to this
[1:43:13] fine building I don't want to point you
[1:43:15] to some organization somewhere I want to
[1:43:17] point you to the man Christ Jesus who
[1:43:20] come to set you free from a life full of
[1:43:22] sin go there and have an experience with
[1:43:25] God and their Devils will bow
[1:43:28] to the name of Jesus Christ
[1:43:30] [Applause]
[1:43:38] Psalm 143
[1:43:40] verse 3.
[1:43:42] for the enemy hath persecuted my soul
[1:43:45] he have smitten my life down
[1:43:48] to the ground
[1:43:50] he hath made me to dwell in darkness
[1:43:53] as those that have long been long dead
[1:43:57] therefore is my spirit
[1:43:59] notice what David keeps saying his
[1:44:02] spirit
[1:44:03] his Spirit remember what we're dealing
[1:44:05] with this extended series on Bathsheba
[1:44:09] all that she must have took with her to
[1:44:11] the Palace all the trauma all the fear
[1:44:14] all the bad memories of an adultery all
[1:44:17] the bad memories of her husband being
[1:44:20] killed by the man who is now her husband
[1:44:22] David
[1:44:25] you imagine trying to fall in love with
[1:44:27] a man that killed your husband
[1:44:30] now if you didn't like her husband you
[1:44:31] might thank him
[1:44:36] but it's evidence she was in love with
[1:44:38] him and he was in love with her
[1:44:40] and then you have to marry the king and
[1:44:42] you got to fall in love with him
[1:44:45] wow
[1:44:47] therefore it's my spirit overwhelmed
[1:44:50] within me my heart within me is desolate
[1:44:54] I remember the days of old I meditate
[1:44:57] on all thy works I Muse
[1:45:01] on the work of thy hands
[1:45:03] let me close with this
[1:45:05] the prophet says that this way we're
[1:45:06] living in an erotic age if you said this
[1:45:09] in May of 1962 what would he say in
[1:45:11] February of 2023.
[1:45:14] we're living in a neurotic age nervous
[1:45:16] tension everybody's racing here and
[1:45:18] there and going there and going nowhere
[1:45:20] ain't that the truth they will run slap
[1:45:23] dab over you if you're you know how many
[1:45:26] ever seconds slow in front of them and
[1:45:28] what they do is they wow like that and
[1:45:30] get to the stoplight three seconds
[1:45:32] before you do which means they get to
[1:45:35] set they're three seconds longer than
[1:45:36] you do and they hurried down to the
[1:45:39] stoplight so they could get there but
[1:45:41] they feel better because they beat you
[1:45:43] and they got around you well come on now
[1:45:45] don't sit there and look at me which are
[1:45:47] you all the slowpokes are the ones who
[1:45:49] go around and beat them to the traffic
[1:45:50] light okay all right we'll not ask that
[1:45:52] but what does it create a nervous
[1:45:54] tension people are so nervous they're
[1:45:58] living you know how it is they're living
[1:45:59] it's such a thing you pull out in front
[1:46:00] of somebody I mean they'll shake their
[1:46:03] fist at you they'll do this and that and
[1:46:05] the other you get a parking spot at
[1:46:07] Walmart and somebody else saw it they
[1:46:09] was on the other side of the parking lot
[1:46:11] but they wanted that and you're right
[1:46:12] here and get it they still think you
[1:46:15] ought to give that to them and yet
[1:46:16] they'll walk three miles in their
[1:46:18] neighborhood in the evening for exercise
[1:46:21] I'm talking about a people that are out
[1:46:23] of their mind why don't you take part of
[1:46:25] that exercise and at Walmart
[1:46:31] it's that kind of an age he said and I
[1:46:33] know this church has plagued with it as
[1:46:34] everywhere else the Tabernacle this
[1:46:36] plate you what
[1:46:40] the Tabernacle or the prophet of God
[1:46:42] pastored
[1:46:45] you mean Elijah's Ministry could not
[1:46:47] keep nervous tension
[1:46:50] off of his own church
[1:46:56] hello Ma
[1:46:58] it's a day of pressure hurry hurry hurry
[1:47:02] hurry hurry somebody needs to write a
[1:47:05] song hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry
[1:47:08] up and wait
[1:47:11] drop 90 miles an hour to get home for
[1:47:13] supper and then wait two hours for it to
[1:47:16] get ready
[1:47:19] in that rushing and speeding it gets you
[1:47:22] to a nervous tension
[1:47:24] the wives say something a little
[1:47:26] contrary and you want to fly off temper
[1:47:29] husband say something you patch your
[1:47:31] foot and tell him to get in the room
[1:47:33] or something this is for some of these
[1:47:34] people to stream the services of course
[1:47:40] uh-huh
[1:47:41] now husband I don't want no words with
[1:47:44] you get out of here oh my God wife oh
[1:47:48] I'm so nervous wow what's the matter
[1:47:51] all this together this tension is
[1:47:53] building up then the results of it is
[1:47:55] doing something wrong
[1:47:58] and acting
[1:48:00] out of place
[1:48:03] nobody raise your hands
[1:48:05] don't bat an eye
[1:48:07] don't move
[1:48:09] I wonder how many of us are guilty of
[1:48:10] this
[1:48:11] tension
[1:48:13] pressure
[1:48:14] and you say something to your wife to
[1:48:17] your husband to your children
[1:48:19] to your friends
[1:48:22] y'all done good you can say Amen now
[1:48:28] so does it make us do something wrong
[1:48:31] now how many honest people
[1:48:34] how much ever got under attention and
[1:48:36] said something you would to God you'd
[1:48:37] never said
[1:48:38] wish you would have never acted in such
[1:48:40] a way
[1:48:43] yes
[1:48:44] so you know what we need friends I think
[1:48:47] I figured out the recipe of what we need
[1:48:49] to help us deal with tension we need to
[1:48:51] eat more corn cakes
[1:48:57] we need to feed more on Christ the word
[1:49:04] oh my goodness he says it'll make the
[1:49:06] poor act that way the middle class
[1:49:08] sacked that way the rich act that way
[1:49:10] it'll make the wrong act that way it'll
[1:49:12] make the pretty good act that way that
[1:49:14] sounds like to me he's covering
[1:49:15] everybody
[1:49:16] it'll make the the good act that way
[1:49:19] because it's tension steam built up got
[1:49:24] to blow it out somewhere if you don't
[1:49:25] you'll blow the boiler up and you'll
[1:49:28] find it builds up as the day goes and
[1:49:30] you talk to your boss if you're working
[1:49:31] also and so on you speak to the kid to
[1:49:33] come in here Mom if you're here oh it
[1:49:35] builds up oh my you feel like you're
[1:49:37] gonna the head's gonna come off I know
[1:49:40] I'm with it every day
[1:49:42] I know what it means it builds up
[1:49:48] now you see your hot water heater
[1:49:50] unless you have on the instant type if
[1:49:52] you have the one with the tank
[1:49:54] it has what is called a pop-off valve
[1:50:00] comes out either at the top or at the
[1:50:02] bottom depends on which type of water
[1:50:03] here it is brother Mike could come tell
[1:50:04] us and explain it to us about how it
[1:50:06] works better than I could
[1:50:07] but it's in case the thermostat gets
[1:50:09] stuck on the inside if I understand it
[1:50:11] right and it don't turn itself off
[1:50:13] and it's just sitting there heating oh
[1:50:16] okay now my search rocks me I tell one
[1:50:18] thing I wanted that certain sheet
[1:50:19] sitting right up there and who's sitting
[1:50:21] in that seat one of them little smarter
[1:50:23] like boys don't they know why I have a
[1:50:25] hard time hearing don't they know I
[1:50:26] wanted that seat so bad I can't
[1:50:28] understand it I'll tell you one thing
[1:50:29] I'm going to quit the church if I don't
[1:50:30] get that table
[1:50:39] I know you may have your favorite pick
[1:50:41] of a seat but you ought to be so happy
[1:50:42] to be in this place if you had to sit in
[1:50:44] the floor
[1:50:45] you'd say thank God we're not in the
[1:50:47] holiday yet
[1:50:54] you didn't have my seat
[1:50:58] no takers huh
[1:51:01] I meant this one not here

[1:51:08] don't like them lights what do you think
[1:51:10] about them panel I don't think I'm going
[1:51:11] back because I don't want them panels I
[1:51:13] don't I just we ought to be so happy to
[1:51:15] be in the house of God that we say Lord

[1:51:19] even noticed I'm so happy I just are
[1:51:21] grateful to have our own church back I
[1:51:23] was just so happy to be in the house of
[1:51:25] God did you notice it nope didn't notice

[1:51:29] presence of God and the singing the
[1:51:31] Clapping the hand glory to God I'm so
[1:51:32] happy I'm so God well I just believe
[1:51:34] I'll fulfill what David said happy is

[1:51:38] going to go and I'm going to clap my
[1:51:40] hands all you people I'm on a shout by
[1:51:42] the voice of Triumph I'm going to praise
[1:51:44] him I'm going to bless his name I'm just
[1:51:46] happy to be in church
[1:51:55] or
[1:51:57] You're Building pressure
[1:52:05] well all our hope is I'm not around when
[1:52:08] you blow
[1:52:15] look friends from the rich to the poor
[1:52:18] everyone
[1:52:19] it crosses every racial barrier every
[1:52:22] cultural barrier everybody is under
[1:52:25] pressure
[1:52:30] America the Great
[1:52:32] great nation of America
[1:52:35] and we just allowed a Chinese balloon
[1:52:38] to fly across our military spots
[1:52:41] our silos and Montana
[1:52:45] uh-huh
[1:52:46] we're great aren't we can't you see it
[1:52:48] our nation is weakening our image before
[1:52:51] the world is weakening why would they do
[1:52:54] that they wouldn't dare do that on
[1:52:56] certain presidents we've had before they
[1:52:58] certainly wouldn't have done that on one
[1:52:59] of my favorite Mr Ronald Reagan uh-huh
[1:53:03] you imagine them send nothing over
[1:53:04] Ronnie oh Ronnie would have took care of
[1:53:06] them Hollywood style
[1:53:08] he'd have blowed them Plum to
[1:53:09] Smithereens but what does it do it's a
[1:53:11] weakness everywhere and what's it create
[1:53:13] more pressure for us
[1:53:15] hey we ain't got access to them bombs
[1:53:17] thank God we don't we we're trusting our
[1:53:20] government to take care of us well I
[1:53:21] don't mind telling you I don't feel too
[1:53:23] comfortable with the job they're doing
[1:53:25] well come on now what's it do it creates
[1:53:27] more pressure I'm glad my trust is not
[1:53:30] in our president I'm glad our trust is
[1:53:32] not in the army or the defense or the
[1:53:35] Congress or the Senate my trust is in
[1:53:37] the Lord God Almighty my confidence is
[1:53:40] in him I found a place where we can
[1:53:43] relieve the pressure
[1:53:45] in Christ Jesus
[1:53:57] let me read one more to you I look at
[1:53:59] the world today what attention the whole
[1:54:00] world lives in and you go down the
[1:54:02] street and it's not even safe to drive
[1:54:04] this is 1964. not even safe to drive
[1:54:07] it's not even safe to be on a four-lane
[1:54:09] highway everybody's at attention
[1:54:11] snapping what's the matter quieten down
[1:54:15] where are you going what was it's making
[1:54:17] the world insane and the incident insane
[1:54:19] institutions are filling up that's
[1:54:21] what's the church in such a turmoil
[1:54:23] they're so they're so head bound on a
[1:54:26] certain thing they won't stop and
[1:54:27] consider God's word in the hour We're
[1:54:29] living all under a strain
[1:54:32] tension
[1:54:34] listen the church age book in the
[1:54:36] thyatitis are changed each age had its
[1:54:39] pressures
[1:54:40] for example a great burden of the last
[1:54:42] age
[1:54:43] is the pressure
[1:54:45] of riches
[1:54:47] soft living
[1:54:49] and nervous tensions
[1:54:52] in a complex age
[1:54:55] that we seem unfitted
[1:54:58] to live in
[1:55:00] did that say it or not
[1:55:05] an age like we live in
[1:55:08] soft living nervous tension in a complex
[1:55:11] age that we seem unfitted
[1:55:15] to live in every day we're here
[1:55:18] it seems less Like Home to me
[1:55:22] I want to be ready to leave
[1:55:25] you see the precious building greater
[1:55:28] and greater and greater and one of these
[1:55:30] days we're going to be
[1:55:32] squeezed right out
[1:55:35] because the pressure will come and the
[1:55:38] squeeze will come against us
[1:55:40] and we
[1:55:43] leave this place
[1:55:45] in a moment
[1:55:47] in the twinkling of an eye
[1:55:52] this barriers if you have
[1:56:02] praise the Lord Jesus
[1:56:08] I'm wondering before we pray today
[1:56:13] how many of you would like to be
[1:56:14] remembered maybe you're just feeling
[1:56:15] such pressure such strength
[1:56:19] maybe you don't feel so much like Elijah
[1:56:21] the prophet but just a believer a
[1:56:23] housewife a husband a layperson that
[1:56:26] loves God and you feel so much pressure
[1:56:28] just of life every day living
[1:56:33] I can't imagine how the people who are
[1:56:36] the world leaders how they must feel
[1:56:38] they can feel it too
[1:56:41] but friends
[1:56:43] in spite of your failures don't you let
[1:56:45] the devil tell you
[1:56:47] there's no need to try anymore
[1:56:49] you've failed him you've let him down so
[1:56:52] many times why would he ever reach out
[1:56:54] to you again
[1:56:56] well I can answer that for you because
[1:56:58] he loves you so much
[1:57:02] he loves you so much
[1:57:04] he loves you beyond your failures your
[1:57:06] mistakes your shortcomings
[1:57:11] Hallelujah
[1:57:13] pick up your pieces
[1:57:15] bring them to Jesus
[1:57:18] but brother Donnie I came well I'll tell
[1:57:20] you what then I'll make you an offer
[1:57:23] I'll help you pick them up
[1:57:26] if you can't
[1:57:27] call me
[1:57:29] if you can't come up and let me pray for
[1:57:31] you
[1:57:32] myself these other brothers many of
[1:57:34] these Saints in this building today will
[1:57:37] do everything we can to help you deal
[1:57:39] with the precious of life
[1:57:42] if I could I would take much of it off
[1:57:44] have you but the lord loves you more
[1:57:46] than that you see he loves you so much
[1:57:49] he knows that when you deal with
[1:57:50] pressure helps make you stronger
[1:57:53] I look at you as your pastor and I think
[1:57:55] oh God take it off of him please Lord
[1:57:57] but he sees what he's going to make out
[1:57:59] of you
[1:58:01] I mean let's be remembered today as we
[1:58:02] pray
[1:58:03] God bless each of you oh my goodness
[1:58:07] those of you out streaming the service
[1:58:09] those of you that'll archive it you just
[1:58:10] raise your hand though where you are as
[1:58:12] well
[1:58:14] Heavenly Father
[1:58:17] we more than likely cannot relate
[1:58:21] to exactly the scope of the pressure
[1:58:23] that Elijah felt because we don't have
[1:58:26] that office and that responsibility that
[1:58:29] he had
[1:58:30] but each of us in our own calling
[1:58:33] in her own position
[1:58:34] we can relate
[1:58:36] maybe the person here today that would
[1:58:38] feel like they are the least Among Us
[1:58:43] they feel like they're the most
[1:58:44] insignificant person
[1:58:46] that you ever saved
[1:58:49] but if they could only believe
[1:58:51] you love them just as much as you did
[1:58:54] Elijah
[1:58:55] you don't love Moses any better than you
[1:58:59] love me
[1:59:00] you don't love Peter James or John
[1:59:03] anymore than you love me
[1:59:06] and you love Peter so much when he
[1:59:08] messed up terribly
[1:59:11] denied you in his strength he felt like
[1:59:14] he could stand but it turned against him
[1:59:17] and he was so weak
[1:59:19] imagine he must have felt so embarrassed
[1:59:21] and so ashamed how could he ever face
[1:59:24] you again
[1:59:26] how could he ever face the rest of the
[1:59:28] disciples that never think the same
[1:59:31] about him that always talk about him
[1:59:33] behind his back
[1:59:35] say he was a coward
[1:59:37] but in spite of all of that
[1:59:39] you loved him so much you sent word
[1:59:42] Hallelujah
[1:59:45] tell my disciples and Peter that I have
[1:59:49] risen from the dead
[1:59:52] Hallelujah
[1:59:54] you knew me but struggle you knew he
[1:59:57] would have a hard time
[1:59:59] so you called him by name
[2:00:01] oh Jesus
[2:00:03] would you do something similar here
[2:00:06] today
