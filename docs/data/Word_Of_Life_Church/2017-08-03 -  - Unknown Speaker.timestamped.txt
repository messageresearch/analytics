[28:10] [Music]
[28:13] thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah
[28:19] amen don't you just love that wonderful
[28:22] name I know some of you were shocked
[28:26] last night whenever I mentioned that
[28:28] there are some of these poor message
[28:31] people that don't worship Jesus no more
[28:37] it's almost more than our minds can
[28:40] comprehend but never thought in this
[28:43] great message which was brought back to
[28:44] the truth that there would be such
[28:47] heresy and lies it's just a lack of
[28:51] understanding and revelation I love the
[28:55] name of Jesus oh you say your simple
[28:59] call me Oh Thomas if you will Thomas
[29:02] bowed down before him and said my lord
[29:04] and my god
[29:09] [Applause]
[29:09] [Music]
[29:14] is not no second person of the Godhead
[29:17] or the third person he is the person we
[29:23] still love him Varun here as long as I'm
[29:26] going to be here as the pastor we're
[29:27] going to praise him with a magnifying
[29:30] we're going to exalt him and lift him
[29:31] higher than the heavens I find it
[29:35] strange I just her brother been said
[29:37] this week that God exalted him so high
[29:39] and gave him such a name that everything
[29:42] in heaven is called a his name man made
[29:45] him so low on the earth and the lowest
[29:47] man in the city had to look down on him
[29:49] Zacchaeus in the tree but he said when
[29:51] God raised him up he has to look down to
[29:54] be able to even see heaven from the
[29:56] Angels that's the way I believe it Amen
[30:02] god bless it has turned today if you
[30:04] would the Song of Solomon again chapter
[30:07] 4 verse 12 both God and Satan know the
[30:17] power of words the power of being able
[30:22] to persuade and being able to convince
[30:26] by visual things and also verbal things
[30:32] Solomon of course knew this as well
[30:36] I don't believe that Solomon was
[30:37] actually fabricating this he's going to
[30:40] tell us today but I believe he he saw it
[30:43] in in this Shulamite he says a garden
[30:48] enclosed is my sister my spouse a spring
[30:52] shutter a fountain sealed that plants
[30:56] are an orchard of pomegranates with
[30:59] pleasant fruits campfire with spikenard
[31:03] spikenard and saffron calamus and
[31:06] cinnamon with all trees of frankincense
[31:08] myrrh and aloes with all chief spices a
[31:13] fountain of gardens a fountain of
[31:16] gardens peculiar statement a fountain of
[31:19] gardens so it's a fountain with many
[31:22] gardens that comes out of it of
[31:24] mountain of gardens a whale of living
[31:27] waters as in plural and streams from
[31:31] Lebanon
[31:33] she is so overwhelmed and so convinced
[31:36] that what he is told her this is her
[31:38] response bang awake o north wind and
[31:41] come down south blow upon my garden that
[31:44] the spices thereof may flow out notice
[31:48] the direction she wants it to go toward
[31:50] now that the spices thereof may flow out
[31:53] let my beloved come into his garden and
[31:57] eat his Pleasant fruits dispersed
[32:01] together Lord Jesus we love you so much
[32:03] today thank you our loving Heavenly
[32:06] Father for being so mindful of us in
[32:09] this hour of darkness and trouble we
[32:12] truly are in a wedding night Lord and as
[32:15] well as any other time of natural even
[32:18] looking at it in the earth when darkness
[32:19] strikes the earth and nighttime comes
[32:22] around things become more scary a noise
[32:25] that we would hear during the day seems
[32:28] to be magnified during the night the
[32:30] unseen is always more difficult to deal
[32:33] with so I pray that should help us and
[32:36] our wedding night Lord as we are facing
[32:39] the greatest darkness that the world has
[32:41] ever known may the light of God shine in
[32:43] our hearts we pray today in Jesus name
[32:46] Amen god bless us and you may be seated
[32:48] truly there is a great parallel between
[32:52] what was going on here in the Song of
[32:54] Solomon and where we are today being
[32:57] quite different of course as we
[32:58] mentioned last night that was her and
[33:01] him they were in in the bridal chamber
[33:03] and the basically the outside noises all
[33:06] the people around them on the outside
[33:08] were totally away from them and they
[33:11] were enjoying each other's presence they
[33:13] were being caught up by each other the
[33:17] attributes that that's so fallen in love
[33:19] with they get no and out at the same
[33:21] time there was all types of revelry and
[33:24] all types of things that was going on on
[33:26] the outside same it is today for those
[33:29] that are in Christ Jesus
[33:30] sealed with the baptism of the Holy
[33:32] Ghost our soul sail on the presence of
[33:34] God the world is shut out in our soul
[33:37] but
[33:38] certainly not in our flesh and in the
[33:40] spirit realm we are naturally affected
[33:42] by those things which are around us
[33:44] Satan learned it many many many many
[33:47] years ago by watching God and also
[33:50] seeing the first human beings that were
[33:52] placed upon the earth that humans have
[33:54] the potential of being greatly affected
[33:56] by the things which are was out and
[33:58] different from themselves they can be
[34:01] affected by words that can be affected
[34:03] by mannerisms that can be affected by
[34:04] behavior they can be affected even
[34:07] before there was television they could
[34:09] be affected by visual effects and things
[34:11] around them we know that in the Garden
[34:13] of Eden there was no TV there was no
[34:15] radio no newspaper no Facebook no cell
[34:18] phones any of that sort of thing but yet
[34:20] still II was affected by something that
[34:23] was apart from herself and it was
[34:25] something that was able to create a
[34:28] question in her mind about the validity
[34:30] of God's Word and about if God was
[34:33] honest and just or not to see if God was
[34:36] really true and to see if God was just
[34:39] by keeping them away from something that
[34:41] this other being was telling them that
[34:43] they should really per take of and
[34:45] should be able to enjoy Satan found it
[34:48] out then remember that's his first
[34:49] battle with the human being had fought
[34:51] with angels but he never fought was
[34:53] humans before so he didn't really know
[34:54] how to do it so it's as if though he's
[34:56] learning it as he goes now we know of
[34:59] course in this day that we live our mind
[35:01] our spirit is under a constant onslaught
[35:04] of things every day that we live what
[35:07] about social media whether by programs
[35:09] sort of by music whether by videos
[35:11] whatever it is newspaper people can be
[35:14] so politically effective we've heard so
[35:16] much about Russia's collusion and all
[35:19] that they've tried to do in our and our
[35:21] elections and all that and people are
[35:23] trying to prove that they effected this
[35:25] and that did they well you know they
[35:26] probably did as no doubt we probably try
[35:29] to do the same thing to theirs because
[35:31] they have spies over here and we have
[35:33] spies over there and we just found one
[35:35] another
[35:36] and that's that sad because that's the
[35:38] hour that we're living in and but we
[35:40] know that people are certainly affected
[35:43] by that you know the Vietcong they used
[35:45] it it was a great thing propaganda Titus
[35:47] used it has been used for centuries in
[35:49] order to be able to propagate what they
[35:51] want you to affect the congregation or
[35:53] the minds of the people and get them to
[35:56] believe what they wanted to believe how
[35:57] in the work at six million Jews much
[35:59] less to polish all the others that were
[36:01] killed during World War two
[36:03] how would they be able to do that in the
[36:05] world set back and hold their peace the
[36:07] propaganda of the Third Reich of the
[36:09] regime by which they were able to be
[36:12] able to project it to the people around
[36:13] the world pick selected pictures pick
[36:16] selected films and so on project that to
[36:19] what they were doing and the world set
[36:20] by and let them on Isle eight millions
[36:23] of people is alright how was it able to
[36:26] be done manipulate the minds of the
[36:29] people as things was trickling out under
[36:32] the reign of the Third Reich if people
[36:33] send they're killing people they're
[36:34] they're burning them and they're putting
[36:36] them gas chambers and they're creating
[36:38] their bodies in the world said no no
[36:40] there's no way this is going on it can't
[36:42] be going on this is the twentieth
[36:43] century how could that be happening so
[36:45] habits are able to do it you're some end
[36:47] goal of course one of the great
[36:48] propagandist of the Third Reich was able
[36:50] to pick the certain videos and the
[36:52] certain things and be able to put it and
[36:54] pull the wool over the entire world's
[36:56] eyes or you say that'll never happen
[36:59] again no it won't happen quiet again
[37:01] like that next time it's going to be
[37:03] even worse I said next time it's going
[37:06] to be even worse it's not going to be so
[37:08] much against the Jews but it's going to
[37:10] be against those who miss the rapture
[37:13] and those who wind up in the tribulation
[37:15] period the church let me just tell you
[37:17] this morning friends that will be the
[37:19] foolish virgin that do not assume the
[37:20] mark of the beast that will also be
[37:22] message people who've sent around in
[37:24] Point Church some of you that attend
[37:27] this church if you don't get on fire
[37:28] with God and get the baptism of the Holy
[37:31] Ghost you're going straight for the
[37:32] tribulation as sure as there's a God in
[37:34] heaven
[37:35] you're not going to go on the rapture
[37:37] just because you say you believe God
[37:39] sent a prophet you're not going in the
[37:41] rapture because you attend happy
[37:43] on the occasion you're going to have to
[37:45] go in the rapture because you are filled
[37:47] with the Holy Ghost and born-again
[37:49] that's the only way you're going I don't
[37:51] have a ticket to be able to hand out to
[37:54] each one of you to give you a token in
[37:56] the rapture you're going because you're
[37:58] born of the Spirit of God there will be
[38:00] thousands no doubt a message people that
[38:03] will wake up one day and realize they
[38:05] have played Church to me they will be
[38:08] the worst category when the morning
[38:10] finally arrives and it dawns on them
[38:12] that they had missed the rapture
[38:14] whenever they look around the pastor's
[38:17] gone and Mama's gone and this one's gone
[38:19] and that one's gone and they go to child
[38:21] and tell them the people the world
[38:22] nugger think they're absolutely nuts
[38:24] they're not going to believe the
[38:26] raptures taking place because their
[38:27] preachers still here and the
[38:29] denominational people how long will it
[38:31] take before some of the message people
[38:33] are able to convince these others a week
[38:36] a month six months of the raptures
[38:38] finally come and they have missed it I
[38:41] don't know because I don't plan on being
[38:43] around I want to be filled with the Holy
[38:45] Ghost right now and they taste some this
[38:48] morning friend I'm not waiting for the
[38:50] Eclipse it's going to come in August I'm
[38:52] not waiting for the solar pattern to
[38:54] come on September the 21st and strike
[38:57] over two roots um I'm ready right now
[39:00] this morning not only that but let me go
[39:02] on and say I live ready every day of my
[39:05] life how many here's with me you live
[39:08] ray you don't have to wait to come to
[39:11] Sunday to get right with God you stay
[39:13] right every day and if you make a
[39:15] mistake and you do something wrong you
[39:17] simply repent of it and ask God to take
[39:19] it out of your life
[39:21] because if you are filled with the Holy
[39:23] Ghost you know it can be at any moment
[39:26] it could be at any time oh brother Donny
[39:28] I'm waiting for this sign and that son
[39:30] you'll never catch it the bride does not
[39:33] live by such a way the bride lives by
[39:36] love not by looking for signs not my
[39:39] reading of newspaper looking for a new
[39:41] website that prophetically tells you
[39:44] when he's coming nobody knows what is
[39:46] coming
[39:47] the Spirit of God here nurse will keep
[39:50] us aware and ready and alone maybe you
[39:56] believe it oh well wants to try to rock
[39:58] us to sleep and get us to where we're
[40:00] complacent and cold and indifferent and
[40:03] like delay the sins but for myself I
[40:05] refuse to be cold in this hour
[40:08] I refuse to be lukewarm I'm going to be
[40:11] on fire
[40:12] Wow because I can't be I can't be I
[40:15] don't need a boat I don't need an
[40:18] approval I don't need none of your
[40:20] approval and you don't need mine if I
[40:22] want to be on file with God I can be on
[40:25] fire with God if I want to be in love
[40:28] with Jesus Christ I can be and so I just
[40:31] take a wheel well glory can I just say
[40:35] how will there again you see that comes
[40:46] from the approach of your mind what you
[40:48] think you can be or what you want to be
[40:50] if you desire to be lukewarm certainly
[40:53] your desires your option to be so if you
[40:55] want to be complacent you can be so if
[40:57] you desire if you can desire to be our
[41:00] desire not to that's just as simple as
[41:03] that now much of what we are is affected
[41:06] of course by the things that are around
[41:07] us and as we look at the wedding not you
[41:10] with a song of solomon and the Shulamite
[41:11] we see he is creating by his love for
[41:14] her and the words that he's saying to
[41:16] her words that will help pull her into
[41:19] an environment that will be conducive
[41:20] for that which is leading up to and this
[41:23] is the wedding night
[41:24] so he must use his words of faithfully
[41:27] truthfully but they must be created I
[41:30] remember this man was a man of very
[41:31] great wisdom and understanding and he
[41:33] had ability to be able to talk and think
[41:35] in a way that most mortals just don't do
[41:37] you can tell by his words and by his
[41:39] parallels and things that he looked at a
[41:41] lot he was a man of such great
[41:43] understanding yet you can see through
[41:45] this in the act of condescension that he
[41:47] was talking to her in a way that she
[41:49] could relate it wouldn't do any good to
[41:51] try to talk to her in a way of being a
[41:53] scientist or some kind of archaeologists
[41:55] or something that she didn't understand
[41:57] so he talked to her
[41:58] a way that would be able to help her to
[42:01] see what he saw in her now as you look
[42:04] at it life's not the way they looked in
[42:06] the Old Testament even the New Testament
[42:07] for many hundreds of years in a mirror
[42:09] was that the mirror was not glass like
[42:11] we have today so they were take advice
[42:14] as Paul said there in 2nd Corinthians
[42:16] that we behold the glory of the Lord and
[42:18] as we behold the glory of the Lord we
[42:20] are changed into the same image I was
[42:22] using the symbolism of a mirror that
[42:24] would have been common era during this
[42:26] time for century and B in the Common Era
[42:28] and it would have been a piece of
[42:29] burnished metal if he said it been
[42:31] polished real bright and as the Sun
[42:33] would come down and hit that mirror then
[42:36] the mirror would actually bend the light
[42:37] or refract the light and as it would
[42:39] come back it would shine upon the face
[42:42] of the person that was holding it now
[42:44] you're appalled takes the same thing and
[42:46] says as we behold the Lord and we look
[42:49] at the glory of the Lord then it is bent
[42:51] and comes right back and shines upon us
[42:54] this is a real believer this is a real
[42:57] Christian it's not something that we try
[42:59] to make ourselves I'm trying to make
[43:02] myself a saint you might as well give up
[43:04] on it cuz you'll never do it I'm trying
[43:06] to make myself bride that won't work
[43:07] either you just had to be born again and
[43:10] that the glory of God shocked a mirror
[43:12] and it shines upon your face it is the
[43:15] radiance from His resurrection that he
[43:17] parts with his bride now in this of
[43:20] course the power of God is what brings
[43:22] this and makes it possible because we
[43:24] certainly could do it on our own solomon
[43:26] wants to do the very same thing to her
[43:28] and helping her to see her position and
[43:31] his love that he has for no doubt she's
[43:33] still nervous she's still jittery how in
[43:35] the world could she be married to the
[43:37] greatest King on the earth at this time
[43:38] and we think the same thing how could
[43:41] God have chosen us certainly not because
[43:43] of our looks our money our wealth our
[43:44] ability to do this and that but we were
[43:47] predestinated for him to be in his bride
[43:49] before the foundation of the world
[43:52] I like to remind the devil of that every
[43:55] now and then I like to remind the devil
[43:57] that he had a birthday I like to let the
[44:01] devil know that there was a day that he
[44:03] was created everything that had a
[44:06] beginning will have him in and because
[44:09] the birth the devil had a birthday he's
[44:11] got a doomsday coming there a man that
[44:16] was created perfect from the day that I
[44:18] created thee until iniquity was found in
[44:21] thee I'm not sure exactly how the devil
[44:23] is I wish I could give him a burst
[44:24] birthday cake on his birthday because I
[44:27] would be celebrating with him that he is
[44:29] a creature of time he is a creature of
[44:35] time oh let me remind him and remind you
[44:38] this morning those of you that are born
[44:40] again you are not creatures of time you
[44:44] have stepped down from eternity into a
[44:46] body called time but you're fixing to
[44:49] move back up again into that loop a man
[44:52] and in the last leg is right now in the
[44:54] final phase where we're going back into
[44:56] eternity again with our Blessed Lord now
[44:59] what difference does that make is that
[45:00] important for us to think on it is
[45:02] certainly it is my friends are Paul
[45:04] tells us in Philippians whatsoever
[45:05] things are lovely whatsoever things are
[45:07] good
[45:07] whatsoever the faithful think on these
[45:10] things why it does something to your fro
[45:12] Neil which is one of the Greek words
[45:14] used for mine it is the way you look at
[45:17] things it shapes the things about you it
[45:19] shapes the way you will notice again
[45:22] Paul says in Ephesians 4:22 that you put
[45:25] off concerning the former conversation
[45:27] the old man which is corrupt according
[45:29] to the deceitful lusts and be renewed in
[45:33] the spirit of your mind notice this in
[45:36] verse 24 that you put on the new man now
[45:39] notice between verse 22 and verse 24 the
[45:43] old man is verse 22 verse 24 is a new
[45:46] man but verse 23 is what brings this to
[45:50] pass be renewed in the spirit of your
[45:53] mind Philippians chapter 2 verse 2 he
[45:56] goes on to say fulfill you my joy that
[45:59] you'd be like
[46:00] and it had in the same love I love the
[46:02] word that he uses for this the
[46:03] light-minded it is thinking the same of
[46:06] each other and not thinking that you are
[46:09] better than someone else oh my I'm
[46:11] having a low esteem of yourself so in
[46:15] other words you don't look at yourself
[46:16] and you're a greater singer you're a
[46:18] greater preacher you're a greater you
[46:20] know whatever more you're more holy
[46:21] you're more this had the other but to be
[46:23] like-minded well praise the Lord having
[46:27] the same love being of one Accord of one
[46:30] mind phony 1:9 again he says let nothing
[46:33] be done through strife or vainglory but
[46:35] in lowliness of mine again he brings it
[46:38] into the same thing that we do not look
[46:40] at ourselves that we are something
[46:42] superior to others who are of the same
[46:45] character and quality
[46:47] now that's very hard because some people
[46:50] that are more gifted in the natural
[46:51] sense they tend to elevate themselves in
[46:54] a spiritual sense that they are better
[46:56] just because a person has a lot of
[46:58] natural talent doesn't make them one bit
[47:00] better spiritually as a matter of fact
[47:03] I've seen a lot of folks with a lot of
[47:04] natural talent they couldn't even live
[47:06] right because they so exalted their
[47:09] natural talent well praise the Lord I
[47:12] remembered in Pentecost I thought I'd
[47:14] passed them days but you come in as a
[47:15] message of relased it's the same thing
[47:17] many times you find talented singers and
[47:19] talented musicians and timely preachers
[47:21] that some of the hardest ones to ever
[47:22] get them to really get live right
[47:24] because they have so much to offer God
[47:26] in the world and everybody so they're so
[47:28] high-minded in themselves
[47:30] it's as if though they feel they are
[47:32] exempt from stringent requirements that
[47:34] God requires of all the rest of us but
[47:36] let me remind you this morning sweetie 5
[47:39] you are required to same thing as the
[47:41] rest of us not his you required the same
[47:44] thing as those of us that are not near
[47:46] as gifted as you are your gift don't
[47:48] make you more holy your ability to
[47:51] preach don't make you no more closer to
[47:53] God that makes you more responsible for
[47:55] something gods give you
[47:57] hey ma'am notice he says but in
[48:01] lowliness of mind let each esteem other
[48:05] better than themselves
[48:08] oh now realize a lot of folks are I'm no
[48:14] good I'm worthless I armor why don't you
[48:18] shut your line mouth
[48:20] most people they carry on like that
[48:22] don't believe that a bit more than
[48:24] nothing
[48:25] you don't believe it and you ain't going
[48:27] to convince us good morning a man let
[48:35] each esteem others better better better
[48:41] [Applause]
[48:44] than themselves look not every man on
[48:48] his own things but every man also on the
[48:50] things of others let this mind be in you
[48:54] now this is what's important let this
[48:56] mind be in you what might this man I
[49:00] just read to you now now this is totally
[49:02] opposite of what Laodicea projects
[49:05] Laodicea projects self this is an age of
[49:08] self self-love self magnification
[49:12] whatever you want to do do it if it
[49:14] feels good do it forget about your wife
[49:17] forget about your mom and daddy just do
[49:19] whatever you want to do this is an age
[49:21] of self I'm glad it is because out of
[49:24] this age of self God is calling a self
[49:27] denying bride
[49:29] we are the contrast servant we are the
[49:32] contrast to the age of self oh my thank
[49:38] you Lord Jesus cost in chapter 1 verse
[49:40] 21 and you that were sometime alienated
[49:44] enemies in your mind by wicked works now
[49:47] notice you were aiding in the word a
[49:49] ladies is lacking the intimate position
[49:51] with God so you were alienated and
[49:54] enemies we're not just in your soul not
[49:57] just in your body but you were enemies
[49:59] in your mind now let me tell you
[50:01] something for it
[50:02] if
[50:02] were enemies in our mind against God
[50:04] originally if you're not careful that's
[50:06] where Satan will try to come and make
[50:08] you back in the enemy against God now
[50:10] well God done this and I don't
[50:11] understand it God let my mama die I
[50:14] don't understand it be careful what you
[50:15] allowing your mind Satan will try to
[50:18] alienate you by making you an enemy I
[50:21] don't understand this about the message
[50:23] and I don't understand that and you
[50:24] better be careful and watch what he's
[50:26] trying to do he will try to alienate you
[50:29] in your mind and you said write down the
[50:31] church pew oh my
[50:34] yet now happy reconcile notice again
[50:36] Constance 2:18 let no man beguile you of
[50:39] your reward in a voluntary humility and
[50:42] worshipping of angels intruding into
[50:44] those things which he has not yet seen
[50:46] vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind
[50:50] again Colossians 3:12 but on therefore
[50:52] as the elect of God holy and beloved
[50:54] bowls of mercies kindness humbleness of
[50:57] mind meekness long-suffering again
[51:01] humbleness am i bringing yourself down
[51:04] bringing yourself down that you're not
[51:06] so super spiritual above everybody else
[51:09] most I'm so for spiritual ones that I've
[51:11] dealt with ain't nothing but
[51:12] troublemakers
[51:13] they know more the pastor does they know
[51:15] more than the citizens there they bout
[51:17] no more God does well thank you Jesus
[51:21] hallelujah 2nd Timothy chapter 1 verse 7
[51:26] for God hath not given us the spirit of
[51:28] fear but of power and of love and of a
[51:33] sound mind
[51:35] both you've got a sound mind in this age
[51:38] you're blessed
[51:39] your pockets may look like that but
[51:42] you're blessed you may not have a nickel
[51:46] in your pocket today but if you've got a
[51:48] sound mind you're a miracle we're living
[51:51] in an age of crazies we're living in an
[51:54] age of absolute insanity and it
[51:58] wonderful to get here do they have a
[52:00] sound mind just be in your right mind
[52:02] and closed notice how Peter relates to
[52:07] this and remember Peter was an ignorant
[52:08] unlearned man couldn't even write some
[52:10] got ahold of him though
[52:11] I forgot the Holy Ghost and they made
[52:13] him able to not only read but also write
[52:15] and use some pretty persuasive words in
[52:17] writing is that word for gird up the
[52:20] loins of your mind now this seems like a
[52:23] very peculiar and strange statement but
[52:25] to the Hebrews the loins was
[52:27] appropriated power in the man's body and
[52:30] from there of course come the ability
[52:31] for him to be able to reproduce himself
[52:33] but Peter likens this that like the mind
[52:37] itself is now the crew procreative
[52:40] ability of the individuals walk with God
[52:43] notice he said wherefore gird up the
[52:45] loins of your mind now this is a very
[52:48] strange statement to us because we don't
[52:50] Gerda
[52:51] no more but in this timeframe remember
[52:53] they would have wore the long robes most
[52:55] men and women and if the men or the
[52:57] women was wanting to run especially the
[52:59] men and had to do hard laborious work
[53:01] outside they would take either a belt or
[53:04] a rope and they would take and pull the
[53:06] long part of their garment up and they
[53:08] would girded up high with the belt or a
[53:11] rope that would free them up and their
[53:13] limbs or they could run where they can
[53:15] move a lot faster and your Peter is
[53:17] using the symbolism of our mind how that
[53:20] our mind must also be girded up so what
[53:24] do we do we take up the excess thoughts
[53:26] the thoughts that don't really we don't
[53:28] need to even think that way anyway and
[53:30] we gird up the loins of our mind now you
[53:33] hear of course they would bring it and
[53:35] then bring it around this part of the
[53:36] body so he's likening the intelligence
[53:39] or the mind I said having the ability no
[53:42] he don't say the Holy Ghost to do this
[53:44] he don't say the possible to it but he
[53:46] tells you as individuals
[53:48] your mama can't do this for your
[53:51] boyfriend your husband came do it for
[53:53] everybody's going to gird up the launch
[53:54] of your mind it's going to be you now
[53:56] from your mind comes a pro creative
[54:00] ability to be able to procreate your
[54:02] spiritual walk with God the loins of
[54:05] your mind wherefore gird up the loins of
[54:08] your mind be sober and hope to the end
[54:11] for the grace that is to be brought unto
[54:13] you at the revelation of Jesus Christ oh
[54:16] my now why does the mind them need to be
[54:19] renewed now this is what Solomon is
[54:21] doing of course of the Shulamite he is
[54:23] actually changing her mind now this is a
[54:26] very delicate thing I've had to do it
[54:27] many times as being a pastor when you go
[54:29] to talking to people about things that
[54:31] they think is wrong things it's just
[54:33] tradition basically they were handed
[54:35] down to from the church they went to
[54:36] from their mother father whoever more
[54:38] and it's a very delicate saying when you
[54:40] walk into someone's conscience and you
[54:43] are manipulating what they think is
[54:45] right and wrong that's very delicate and
[54:47] it must be done but sometimes you got to
[54:49] break into their conscience and you have
[54:51] to take out that traditional something
[54:53] that's almost like a conscience surgery
[54:55] you've got to go into their conscience
[54:57] and pull out that traditional thing that
[55:00] they feel like is wrong yet they have
[55:02] nothing in the word that says so but
[55:03] momma grandpas and my grandma said it
[55:05] was and you had to go in there and be
[55:07] able to remove that part from their
[55:10] conscience and replace that part with a
[55:12] truth from the Word of God now the
[55:14] delicate part about it is not only why
[55:17] you're in there during the surgery but
[55:18] then after you leave and sew them up
[55:21] then they will go home and then go to
[55:22] thinking of the other parts of the
[55:24] access of their conscience or what about
[55:26] this is this wrong is that wrong is this
[55:28] wrong I don't even know what's right and
[55:29] wrong anymore
[55:30] now the power of that lays was in us
[55:33] when we go to sorting it through why
[55:35] does our minds need to be renewed
[55:37] because they are constantly under an all
[55:40] salt every day that we live in Satan
[55:42] sees so the mind is programmed listen to
[55:45] me now the mind is programmed by our
[55:48] parents by our family by their education
[55:51] by our mentors by the teachers or the
[55:53] preacher
[55:54] by the people to go to church well by
[55:57] the people with fellowship with so our
[55:59] beliefs are all of these things that are
[56:01] in us they come from somewhere many of
[56:04] them are not the Word of God come on
[56:07] church our thoughts our ideas our
[56:10] opinions about this and that and the
[56:12] other and we hold them many times we
[56:14] hold it because of a family member we
[56:16] hold it because of an association or
[56:18] score in our life but it's buried so
[56:21] deep we just know that it's got to be
[56:23] the truth not necessarily it may be very
[56:26] deep very deep in your conscience but
[56:28] that don't mean that it's right and
[56:30] that's why when you go to operating on
[56:32] people in a very surgical type of way
[56:34] and to removing those things they'll
[56:35] clamp up on you ain't getting that away
[56:37] from me bless God my grandma told me and
[56:40] my grandpa go ahead if you want to keep
[56:42] that brain tumor go ahead and keep it
[56:43] I'm trying to help you here today with a
[56:45] little bit of spiritual serger if you'll
[56:47] let me
[56:47] [Applause]
[56:49] now even prejudices and opinions and
[56:52] things that we have they are molded I
[56:55] come on say so tighten up on me you know
[56:57] folks live in the south if I have a
[56:59] racial issue I'll tell you what they
[57:00] need to do they need to get saving it's
[57:02] old it goes any white man that don't
[57:05] love a black man's not born again any
[57:09] white man that don't love an American
[57:11] Indian or a Korean or Japanese or
[57:13] whatever more and he looks at himself
[57:15] and thinks that he's superior race get
[57:17] rid of that old Hepler spirit all for
[57:19] you
[57:20] hey how did he go the other way a black
[57:24] man or a black woman that don't love a
[57:25] white man they need the Holy Ghost as
[57:27] well that's right
[57:31] what Mo's all this it's prejudices and
[57:33] these things that maybe happen and
[57:35] there's no question about it
[57:36] many of the black people have suffered
[57:38] awful terrible things at the hand of the
[57:41] white people there's no question about
[57:42] it but you realize friends my goodness
[57:45] my great great great great great
[57:46] grandfather mother than subjects on it
[57:48] but I never I never inside no black man
[57:52] or no Indian or nobody else and I have
[57:53] no plan on going south but what is it
[57:56] they see a certain color that prejudice
[57:58] raises up within there and they be
[58:00] looking at a person that is totally
[58:02] innocent that would never do them any
[58:04] harm but it is embedded in their
[58:06] conscience it is a president why why am
[58:08] I going this way it is a prejudice that
[58:11] is buried within there's the leverage
[58:14] here this morning for you my goodness
[58:23] whoa sir I mean you just let us have it
[58:26] today now these things come from our
[58:30] parents our grandparents or things that
[58:33] have happened to us naturally of course
[58:35] no doubt their social and I couldn't
[58:37] keep from having a process about a king
[58:39] being a rich man a man that was a
[58:41] wealthy man a man that was Updike so
[58:43] whatever more they called them and that
[58:44] day we have our slang form today people
[58:47] that live in a certain style of house
[58:48] and God a certain type of car and all
[58:50] that we would have our certain little
[58:52] slang words that we would use for those
[58:53] people and if you're not careful the
[58:55] poor can have just as much prejudice
[58:57] toward the rich as the risk and towards
[58:59] the poor well friends i'ma go and preach
[59:01] this morning I don't know or than
[59:05] anything that makes us whether it's on
[59:07] like Christ God wants to help us to get
[59:09] rid of and those things that for me in
[59:12] us that's what makes it so difficult
[59:13] then when they go to sorting through now
[59:15] you'd imagine maybe she had some sort of
[59:17] a prejudice toward a person of renown
[59:21] personal well a person like a kid what's
[59:24] he trying to do help her to get rid of
[59:26] that by bringing himself down on her
[59:29] level to be able to help her oh my
[59:32] hallelujah kind of go on thank you now
[59:39] remember you asked me to do it when two
[59:47] German universities join forces to
[59:49] investigate social networking
[59:51] researchers discovered that discovered
[59:54] that one in three people surveyed felt
[59:56] worse lonely frustrated or angry after
[59:59] spending time smoking drinking
[1:00:05] committing adultery
[1:00:06] sent at the bar on Facebook

[1:00:32] depression low diversity children I've
[1:00:35] got enough in this world of cause it why

[1:01:02] time on social media leading them to
[1:01:05] turn to substance abuse unsafe sexual

[1:19:47] this world in Iraq
[1:19:49] [Applause]
[1:20:01] kids I notice going to bend this hard
[1:20:05] today how would we come to church
[1:20:11] reduction of normal social /
[1:20:13] recreational activities someone
[1:20:17] suffering from fad will reduce the time
[1:20:20] spent catching up with friends playing
[1:20:22] sport or whatever it is they used to
[1:20:24] enjoy doing to simply spend time on
[1:20:26] Facebook instead of catching up with a
[1:20:29] friend for coffee they will send a
[1:20:31] Facebook message a dinner plate will be
[1:20:37] substituted with a messenger chat boy
[1:20:44] hound dog in the henhouse look all over
[1:20:46] his church this morning in extreme cases
[1:20:49] a person will even stop answering their
[1:20:52] parents phone calls instead insisting
[1:20:55] they use Facebook to contact them fake
[1:21:05] friends if 8 out of 10 people shown on
[1:21:09] their Facebook page are complete
[1:21:11] strangers it is undeniable they have a
[1:21:14] serious case of fad oh we better call
[1:21:22] 9-1-1 right now longer I go the worse
[1:21:26] it's getting in here fevers high blood
[1:21:29] pressure passing out is his passing out
[1:21:32] coming over the congregation right now
[1:21:36] or children
[1:21:42] complete addiction when they meet new
[1:21:44] people they say their name followed by
[1:21:47] I'll talk to you on Facebook or those
[1:21:51] who are extremely bad I'll see you in
[1:21:55] Facebook
[1:21:56] what is it it is a world that is unreal
[1:22:00] but to them they are so addicted they
[1:22:04] will see them in Facebook don't you see
[1:22:08] there's a parallel to this when we can
[1:22:12] get that addiction to Jesus Christ and
[1:22:14] we tell him I'll see you in Happy Valley
[1:22:17] on Sunday morning Lord I know you're
[1:22:21] going to be there I know your presence
[1:22:23] is going to be there I'm going to bring
[1:22:24] you with through the Lord I know I'm
[1:22:26] going to meet you there their pets have
[1:22:37] Facebook pages now that's something I
[1:22:46] want to say a dog on Facebook and I'm
[1:22:51] sure there's a lot to like it was on how
[1:22:53] much I'm poor leg again can't you just
[1:22:58] see a Doberman Pinscher sitting there
[1:22:59] now do we have what it is they do on
[1:23:01] Facebook the pets are Facebook pages and
[1:23:05] any notifications wall posts in boxes or
[1:23:07] friend requests that they receive give
[1:23:09] them a high listen children then when
[1:23:17] they are canta I'm trauma dadich's it
[1:23:20] actually releases to them an endorsement
[1:23:23] from the brain that produces it lifts
[1:23:29] them it helps them maybe they're down
[1:23:30] there feeling low and ever chirp or beef
[1:23:32] or whatever more it actually gives them
[1:23:34] a surge it's only momentarily but it's a
[1:23:37] high a temporary high
[1:23:45] one which can be compared to the
[1:23:48] gambling addicts that get from the
[1:23:51] pokies or the roulette table studying
[1:23:56] the brains of Facebook addicts they
[1:23:59] found the same part of the brain that
[1:24:02] reacts now they took those individuals
[1:24:03] and put them through MRIs but their
[1:24:06] phones in there they couldn't access it
[1:24:07] but they could hear the chirps
[1:24:09] they could hear their whatever them
[1:24:10] signals are whatever the you y'all
[1:24:12] understand what I'm talking about
[1:24:13] whatever it was and they would watch the
[1:24:15] brain of this person they could not even
[1:24:18] see it but they would flash before them
[1:24:21] Facebook symbols and flash before them
[1:24:23] certain things and age time they would
[1:24:25] do it their brain would react but the
[1:24:27] difficult part about it was it was the
[1:24:30] same part of the brain that reacts to a
[1:24:32] heroin addict
[1:24:45] [Applause]
[1:24:49] [Music]
[1:24:52] hey smart very beneficial in some ways
[1:24:54] is having detrimental effect on the
[1:24:55] everyday behaviors of people around the
[1:24:57] world when an individual's online life
[1:25:00] becomes more important than the real one
[1:25:03] we know that there is a serious problem
[1:25:05] that needs to be addressed now why does
[1:25:11] our mind then need to be renewed because
[1:25:13] we've got all this stuff out there
[1:25:14] there's so many ways that we can be
[1:25:17] contacted and there's so many ways that
[1:25:19] we can't on Beggs it's amazing me we can
[1:25:22] contact the same people 13 or 14
[1:25:25] different ways 20 over quota mark
[1:25:27] Latimer and then Facebook them in the
[1:25:28] message Amanda why do you need all the
[1:25:31] things for the very same person I mean
[1:25:34] maybe I'm dance or something I don't
[1:25:36] know but there isn't one enough of the
[1:25:38] very same one unless you've got a
[1:25:39] girlfriend on the side why would I want
[1:25:43] to tweet by the skipping jinjin touch by
[1:25:45] the up and call by the skip and video
[1:25:47] message by the skip and be able to do
[1:25:49] all that to the same person I truly
[1:25:51] don't think I'm not sinless as nuts as I
[1:25:54] am so what in the world's going on is to
[1:25:57] fill up our lives and our mind with all
[1:26:00] of this other chatter of the world to
[1:26:03] break our divine fellowship with
[1:26:05] Almighty God
[1:26:10] notice Solomon in proverbs 23:7 said bur
[1:26:13] as a man thinketh in his heart so is he
[1:26:17] Philippians 4:8 finally brethren
[1:26:19] whatsoever things are true whatsoever
[1:26:20] things are honest whatsoever things are
[1:26:22] oh my are the just and of a pure
[1:26:24] whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever
[1:26:26] things are of a good report if there be
[1:26:29] any virtue if there be any praise think
[1:26:32] on these things Romans 12:2 be not
[1:26:39] conformed to the world but be
[1:26:41] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:26:44] that you may prove OMA that you may
[1:26:48] prove this is the same word used for
[1:26:50] medals and being able to prove the
[1:26:52] strength the density of medals that you
[1:26:54] may prove what is that good and perfect
[1:26:58] and acceptable will of God is this more
[1:27:02] important than the things that you're
[1:27:04] the world if mothered are you said I'm
[1:27:06] wrong to have Facebook I'm not saying it
[1:27:08] at all
[1:27:08] I'm saying it's how you use it or let me
[1:27:13] rephrase it how it uses you
[1:27:21] Risa's I know there's going to be a
[1:27:25] whole line of people stand up on the
[1:27:26] outside it won't take me for lunch today
[1:27:28] after this tremendous wonderful sweet
[1:27:31] farm and well no they won't take us out
[1:27:35] honey for five years
[1:27:39] brother Kenneth used to say after this
[1:27:41] I'm work
[1:27:47] you said the Sims is that a renewed mind
[1:27:51] is absolutely essential to finding the
[1:27:55] will of God how can a person who has a
[1:27:59] mind and their spirit all filled with
[1:28:01] all these things of the world out here
[1:28:03] and ever find the will of God for the
[1:28:07] life especially if you're posted on
[1:28:10] Facebook that you're finding trying to
[1:28:12] find the will of God for this at another
[1:28:13] get ready for a deluge it's amazing to
[1:28:17] me how people can always tell you and I
[1:28:19] to find the will of God main had it in
[1:28:21] forty seven years but they can tell you
[1:28:22] how to find it for your a lot they can
[1:28:25] pay in five seconds a perfect will of
[1:28:26] God for your alive No thank you I'll
[1:28:28] just stick it out between me and God
[1:28:30] myself a heart would love a heart that
[1:28:33] is pulled away from the things of the
[1:28:34] world can you use these things of course
[1:28:36] we can can we be able to use the
[1:28:39] internet we can you know there's some
[1:28:40] brothers in the message that preach the
[1:28:42] Internet is the mark of the beast yeah
[1:28:45] an India body that has the Internet in
[1:28:47] their home house the mark of the beast
[1:28:48] well I'll preach the same thing as you
[1:28:50] can summon with the Bible or the prophet
[1:28:52] of God said such a thing
[1:28:53] come on now it is a means by which were
[1:28:56] able to use it the very first quote on
[1:28:58] message faces the Simpsons 1947 our
[1:29:00] brothers he said I've got some new
[1:29:02] recording machines the very first quote
[1:29:04] in the entire message that is recorded
[1:29:06] is brother Branham attributing to the
[1:29:08] Advancement of science and what they've
[1:29:10] been able to do to make the messages
[1:29:12] more available are you glad for the tape
[1:29:14] recorder in this day it was not an
[1:29:16] invention of the Holy Ghost it was an
[1:29:18] invention by man ordained to be used for
[1:29:21] the saints of God are you glad when you
[1:29:24] cannot be a church if you're able to
[1:29:25] stream
[1:29:27] if you say home and shame and you could
[1:29:29] be a church altar streamer blows a hole
[1:29:31] in your sheetrock god never intended for
[1:29:36] you to stay home and you'd be the house
[1:29:37] of God but it can be used in the right
[1:29:40] way aren't you glad for yourself aren't
[1:29:43] you glad for those things that can be
[1:29:45] used in the right way but God wants us
[1:29:47] to use and a sane sensible people I

[1:30:45] on every may god help us to me it'll be
[1:30:55] a greater age to overcome that in the
[1:30:57] age of 17
[1:30:58] can you imagine Peter and Paul and first
[1:31:01] century Christians been able to step out
[1:31:03] of that age as they could have down the
[1:31:05] curtain of time and in a mortal body
[1:31:06] step into this room and look and see
[1:31:09] what we have to deal with every day that
[1:31:11] is overwhelmed can you imagine your
[1:31:15] grandmother your great-grandmother being
[1:31:19] able to stand up and look and see think
[1:31:21] how do you all do it when you all ever
[1:31:24] have time for prayer of course they
[1:31:29] plowed the fields from Sun up to Sun Sun
[1:31:31] said they milk the cows they cleaned out
[1:31:33] the bar and say they had a whole lot
[1:31:36] more to do at least if they had time
[1:31:39] left over to pray and seek God most of
[1:31:43] you may be working on eight hour a day I
[1:31:45] saw the mother eyes what you feel with
[1:31:47] some winds and things
[1:31:52] mama can we hear in this morning as he
[1:31:59] is pulling us up close to him wanting to
[1:32:04] take his words and reshape our thinking
[1:32:08] young girls young men be careful who
[1:32:11] what friends you making them chat rooms
[1:32:16] Amen there young ladies every week that
[1:32:21] are killed because they meet some
[1:32:24] renegade and a chatroom and go off some
[1:32:28] word meeting they slit sore throat
[1:32:31] don't try to set stuff go off to meet
[1:32:35] somebody never even met before what's
[1:32:37] wrong with people what do you suppose
[1:32:39] it's insanity do you understand that
[1:32:42] insanity is creeping in our churches
[1:32:45] people are doing things they wouldn't
[1:32:47] even thought of doing years ago why
[1:32:49] they're becoming desensitized this is a
[1:32:53] friend on my chat wall this is really
[1:32:56] how do you know and your parents would
[1:32:59] let them do it
[1:33:13] I'll have hell to pay for this
[1:33:21] [Music]
[1:33:21] [Applause]
[1:33:24] [Music]
[1:33:28] [Applause]
[1:33:29] [Music]
[1:33:38] more excuses this is parents again if
[1:33:42] you would have on your father I know
[1:33:49] this has been difficult today but I
[1:33:53] absolutely refuse to bring reproach upon
[1:33:55] you your spirit and what you've led me
[1:33:59] to say by apologizing I am NOT going to
[1:34:03] do it I pray Lord that should deal with
[1:34:06] every heart here today I know many of
[1:34:10] them don't have facebook they're not
[1:34:11] involved in in the addiction part of it
[1:34:14] and all that some of them use in the
[1:34:15] right way they use it with restraints
[1:34:17] but Lord may this be a warning to those
[1:34:20] who do that Lord than others of us that
[1:34:24] don't even have facebook maybe realize
[1:34:25] just because we don't have that domain
[1:34:27] it weren't not being unarmed salt from
[1:34:29] other avenues sometimes it's living with
[1:34:33] a friend is living with a adulterer
[1:34:36] mother that's constantly feeding us
[1:34:38] constant negativity constant negative
[1:34:41] things reshaping our mind
[1:34:43] help us Lord Jesus we know Lord living
[1:34:49] in your presence feeding on your word
[1:34:51] you will shape us into that image as the
[1:34:55] light of the Sun shines upon the
[1:34:58] burnished mirror the brighter a chance
[1:35:01] the more of its glory can shine upon us
[1:35:04] truly this is our desire today each of
[1:35:08] us have so many mistakes and so many
[1:35:10] faults were faulty people forgive us
[1:35:14] Lord forgive us of our shortcomings help
[1:35:18] us father to use all these things off
[1:35:20] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:35:23] sameness sensibly praise God lord I
[1:35:29] thank you for many of them they have
[1:35:30] been such a tremendous blessing Lord I
[1:35:34] remember years ago remember brother Neal
[1:35:36] Holland's under the earlier pioneers
[1:35:39] that was going to put the message and
[1:35:40] make it available where we could search
[1:35:42] it seemed like a dream back years years
[1:35:45] ago yet Lord Saints right here on this
[1:35:49] church
[1:35:50] Saints up in the church in Lima in
[1:35:52] different places were able to listen and
[1:35:54] type down or to put all the message to
[1:35:57] be able to put it in a software now I
[1:36:00] surround the world in a moment of time
[1:36:02] that can type in a few words it's on our
[1:36:05] phones I use it almost daily sending
[1:36:09] quotes to brothers to encouragement what
[1:36:13] a blessing but that same phone of mine
[1:36:16] to be able to look at all kinds of fills
[1:36:19] and all kinds of nonsense meme fit
[1:36:22] wasn't sexual sinful stuff in that way
[1:36:25] it could be all kinds of negativity and
[1:36:27] running people down and whatever more
[1:36:29] Lord I've got enough to deal with I
[1:36:32] would have feed on things that are pure
[1:36:35] whole in just that my mind can be
[1:36:39] renewed I can't go to Lowe's a Walmart
[1:36:43] father hardly a time without seeing or
[1:36:46] hearing something that is adverse to the
[1:36:49] kingdom of God Lord Jesus I pray you'd
[1:36:52] help each of us to know that being born
[1:36:56] again is a one-time thing renewing our
[1:36:58] mind is a daily constant ongoing process
[1:37:04] Paul mentioned that we changed from
[1:37:06] glory to glory we know that that is
[1:37:09] gradual it is progressive as we are
[1:37:12] changed and washed and our minds are
[1:37:15] renewed so we move from glory to glory
[1:37:17] maybe that people look today and see may
[1:37:20] they ask themselves am I really growing
[1:37:22] in God am i excelling in God if I moved
[1:37:25] in glory since five years or have a
[1:37:27] regret no doubt no doubt if they answer
[1:37:33] they're not where they used to be or
[1:37:34] they're not where they need to be no
[1:37:36] doubt if they would look at their mind
[1:37:38] and see what they're thinking on they
[1:37:42] will find a connection Lord Jesus help
[1:37:46] us let this mind that was in you being
[1:37:50] us who being in the form of God thought
[1:37:53] it not robbery to be equal with God
[1:37:58] Minister to your people today father the
[1:38:01] visible audience invisible audience or
[1:38:04] Dino the effects of this will
[1:38:06] around the world made a Spirit of God
[1:38:09] help each of us to hear it in the right
[1:38:11] spirit and attitude that it was given in
[1:38:14] Lord there's anyone guilty here today no
[1:38:17] doubt there must be some somewhere you
[1:38:19] never put it on the heart that I pray
[1:38:21] that you would help them help them to
[1:38:25] break that addiction use it Lord as
[1:38:28] these things off the tree of knowledge
[1:38:29] of good and evil can be used as we go to
[1:38:32] hospitals and we use glasses and
[1:38:34] contacts and medication and AIDS and
[1:38:37] this and that and the other that's been
[1:38:38] given to us but we use them sensibly
[1:38:41] they we use these tools that Satan is so
[1:38:45] injected into this age the same way if
[1:38:49] the Saints would use Facebook in the
[1:38:50] proper way for prayer requests and
[1:38:53] testimonies and good things like that it
[1:38:55] could be a great thing the Lord had
[1:38:58] heard the other day of a church not near
[1:39:00] us but a church in another state and the
[1:39:03] members of that church was fussing back
[1:39:05] and forth back and forth on Facebook

[1:39:10] church and even sinners respond in San I
[1:39:14] thought you all were Christians I
[1:39:16] thought you all were saved so instead of
[1:39:20] handling them problems as they ought to
[1:39:22] in the backyard they pulled it right on
[1:39:24] the front yard and put it right there
[1:39:26] before them unbelievers help us Lord
[1:39:30] Jesus to realize we will be held
[1:39:32] accountable for such things those
[1:39:36] believers in that church will be held
[1:39:38] accountable for bringing the reproach
[1:39:40] upon that pastor in that church help us
