[47:51] the last year and you sing
[47:52] all the trials and different things
[47:55] we've been through
[47:57] yet the grace of God has helped us
[47:59] brought us through it all
[48:01] I'm sure no matter what we face this
[48:03] year he'll be right here with us for me
[48:05] amen amen we're so so grateful that we
[48:09] can have confidence in this and his
[48:10] promise today greet you today in the
[48:12] name of the lord it's an honor for us to
[48:14] be able to be gathered together here
[48:17] so appreciate all that the Lord is doing
[48:20] um I want to say that we're supposed to
[48:23] get our final inspection on Thursday so
[48:26] we just pray everything goes well
[48:29] let God give us favor and inside of all
[48:32] these people that are coming in
[48:34] and as soon as we can get everything
[48:36] finished up we'll be moving
[48:39] Moving Day
[48:41] I want to say how much I appreciate
[48:45] so many brothers that have come
[48:48] it's just incredible all that they've
[48:51] done
[48:52] sisters haven't come yet because we
[48:55] haven't made it ready to start cleaning
[48:57] but don't worry sisters
[49:00] you're gonna get your time
[49:03] but just so many of what they've done is
[49:06] just overwhelming and I want to say it
[49:09] how much we appreciate it today
[49:11] let's turn to the Book of Proverbs if
[49:13] you would chapter 31.
[49:15] we're returning also
[49:17] Carolyn I'd like to thank you for all
[49:19] the Christmas cards and chocolate and
[49:23] gift cards and chocolate
[49:27] cookies and did I say chocolate I did
[49:31] say chocolate okay thank you
[49:33] thank you that no one sent me broccoli
[49:40] although I did get a t-shirt from
[49:42] someone from Canada that had a picture
[49:44] of a broccoli head on it said Brock Lee
[49:47] l-e-e broccoli so
[49:51] we certainly appreciate all that thank
[49:53] you so much it's
[49:54] kind of you to do so
[49:57] anyone has any extra diet pills left
[50:00] just see me after church
[50:04] Proverbs 31 10.
[50:08] who can find a virtuous woman
[50:13] for her price
[50:15] is far above rubies
[50:19] the heart of her husband
[50:21] to safely trust in her
[50:25] so that he shall have no need
[50:29] of spoil
[50:31] wow what a woman yeah
[50:34] what a woman this is
[50:37] one thing to me that makes us so
[50:39] profound is we've been looking at is
[50:41] that
[50:42] the Jewish historians rabbis and many
[50:45] different teachers say this proverbs 31
[50:48] was written about
[50:50] Bathsheba
[50:55] Bathsheba
[50:57] a woman placed in the genealogy of our
[51:00] Lord and yet one that we
[51:02] probably wouldn't think too highly of
[51:06] notice what verse 11 says the heart of
[51:08] her husband does safely trusts in her
[51:11] so that he shall have no need of spoil
[51:16] she will do him good
[51:18] and not evil all the days of her life
[51:22] I may like to be remembered today as we
[51:24] pray God bless you Licious Bower heads
[51:27] together and hold our requests in our
[51:29] hearts
[51:31] Lord Jesus it's with gratitude and
[51:35] Thanksgiving that we
[51:38] are able to come together again today in
[51:40] this place
[51:42] only been rented for us and only
[51:45] temporarily and hopefully before long
[51:47] we'll be able to have our own place back
[51:49] again but we have been grateful that
[51:52] we've had this place
[51:54] and we're thankful that each and every
[51:57] time you've showed up with us and we're
[52:00] so thankful that you have
[52:02] today Lord we are
[52:04] at the beginning of our new year
[52:07] and we certainly want to look forward to
[52:11] what great things you're going to do for
[52:13] us
[52:14] I hope it's all on my heart this is the
[52:17] year of the going away
[52:19] the year of the rapture
[52:22] if it's not then it will be the year of
[52:26] fighting the year that we will make hell
[52:29] pay
[52:30] it will be the year of us overcoming the
[52:33] year of us standing like we've never
[52:36] stood before
[52:38] so father we approach this new year
[52:41] today with your grace and your mercy
[52:44] we don't come today with a hangover
[52:46] where we'll be drunk last night and
[52:48] drunk the hill you're out and the new
[52:50] one in no doubt a lot of people did
[52:52] they're going to wake up to Dave feeling
[52:54] pretty bad
[52:55] but we've come into the house of God
[52:57] feeling really good amen because the
[53:01] Lord is on our side
[53:03] help us today as we look into your word
[53:05] father help me to get out of the way
[53:07] break the bread of life to us in your
[53:10] manner we pray in Jesus name amen God
[53:14] bless you you may be seated
[53:21] I'd like to read to you something that
[53:23] brother Anna mentions about
[53:25] David
[53:27] and Bathsheba
[53:29] he said David was worthy of dying
[53:33] he pronounced his own deaths but Nathan
[53:37] said surely
[53:39] you'll not die
[53:41] for he knowed David knew God
[53:44] and knew that he had done wrong
[53:47] he had defiled
[53:49] his brother's wife
[53:53] so it was not Bathsheba that was playing
[53:56] the Harlot
[53:57] was not Bathsheba that was being the
[54:00] temptress
[54:01] but actually King David
[54:03] defiled her
[54:05] in the message of Grace he says God
[54:07] revealed it to the prophet he said David
[54:09] there was a rich man on this side of the
[54:12] road he had a whole lot of sheep very
[54:15] rich and a man lived on this side of the
[54:19] road and he was very poor he only had
[54:22] one land
[54:23] he treated it like a daughter and he fed
[54:27] it out of the same spoon that he himself
[54:31] ate out of
[54:33] he slept with this lamb it was just like
[54:36] a daughter and one day a visitor came
[54:40] so instead of this man taking one of his
[54:42] own sheep and making a feast for the
[54:45] visitor he went and took the poor man's
[54:49] land now listen how brother Branham says
[54:52] this by force
[54:54] he took the lamb and slayed it and made
[54:59] a feast
[55:01] he took it by force
[55:05] and slayed it and made it a feast so
[55:09] again brother Branham is not blaming
[55:12] Bathsheba as being the temptress or the
[55:15] seductress but actually the victim
[55:20] he goes on to say now that was David's
[55:22] Passions
[55:24] now the stranger that came to David's
[55:28] house was his passions or lust
[55:33] and instead of David going listen how he
[55:37] continues this he had 500 wives but when
[55:40] he seen uriah's wife instead of taking
[55:43] one of his 500 wives to appease or
[55:47] satisfy his Passions
[55:50] he went and took this other man's wife
[55:53] then he killed Uriah when she become a
[55:57] mother
[55:58] why oh he said David no notice he didn't
[56:02] know what he was doing he's talking
[56:04] about pronouncing judgment on himself
[56:06] David was ready to pronounce this
[56:09] judgment and that's the way we are we
[56:12] can always judge the other fella but
[56:15] when it comes to us oh it's so different
[56:22] you know when I look at Bathsheba
[56:26] I see a woman that was introduced into
[56:29] the Palace of the king
[56:32] and the Very adverse conditions
[56:35] she was defiled
[56:38] the king forced himself honor
[56:42] she really
[56:44] couldn't have done much by the law of
[56:47] Moses the Torah
[56:49] she was supposed to have at least cried
[56:53] out
[56:54] the Bible doesn't really say if she did
[56:57] or didn't
[56:58] but I can imagine for her there was so
[57:01] much trauma and so much fear
[57:05] and anxiety
[57:07] now remember whenever Matthew and Luke
[57:09] both go to putting together the
[57:13] genealogy of the Lord Jesus and Matthew
[57:16] goes toward the genealogy of of Joseph
[57:20] but Luke goes toward the genealogy of
[57:24] Mary
[57:25] bringing Jesus as being the son of David
[57:29] but we see that these Gentile women
[57:32] which were in the makeup of producing
[57:35] this lineage for the Lord Jesus there
[57:39] was Ruth's and there was Rahab and there
[57:42] was Tamar and Bathsheba and of course
[57:46] the last Being Mary all the other four
[57:49] Were Somehow tainted and one way or
[57:52] another in a bad way
[57:54] and yet the Lord allowed them to make up
[57:58] the coming of the births of the Lord
[58:00] Jesus
[58:01] to me it's more than just the natural
[58:05] genealogy that God wanted us to see but
[58:08] there's something that each of these
[58:10] Gentile women
[58:12] project into the spiritual making of the
[58:15] body of God the female part of God
[58:19] because there is a counterpart in the
[58:23] Old Testament from The Book of Genesis
[58:25] chapter 3 we can see that God began to
[58:29] project a female counterpart into the
[58:33] part of redemption and God even says to
[58:37] the serpent he does not say that man
[58:40] would be the one that would be able to
[58:43] be the Redeemer not Adam
[58:46] but he says that there would be enmity
[58:48] between The Serpent and the woman or why
[58:52] didn't he say the man how come he didn't
[58:54] say now Adam you're the strong one it
[58:57] will be Moses and it will be Zephaniah
[58:59] Zechariah Malachi Abacus how come he
[59:02] didn't say that why did he say a woman
[59:04] because there was a female counterpart
[59:08] in God's attributes that would be used
[59:10] to bring forth Redemption so he says
[59:14] that there will be enmity between thee
[59:17] and the woman and between thy seed and
[59:21] her seed and I know the woman don't even
[59:23] have a seed
[59:24] and he says that he shall bruise your
[59:29] head and you will bruise his heel but
[59:31] you notice he didn't say both of his
[59:33] heels only one
[59:35] so he showed that there would be a
[59:38] battle that would be from that time all
[59:41] the way to the end and we're still
[59:43] ensued in that battle of course to this
[59:45] day
[59:45] but when we look at it God already had
[59:48] this plan of redemption in mind and it
[59:51] involved more than men it involved women
[59:56] whenever I look at Bathsheba I look and
[59:59] see a woman that was as Solomon
[1:00:03] described her a woman of Great Value a
[1:00:07] woman that was so after God's Own Heart
[1:00:12] as her husband
[1:00:14] but initially we don't find that this
[1:00:17] love between her and David was quite
[1:00:21] reciprocating
[1:00:23] she was not there because she chose to
[1:00:26] be there she was actually forced by a
[1:00:30] man that was greater than her a man who
[1:00:33] had Authority a man well looked at by
[1:00:36] the well you know sort of people the
[1:00:38] people no doubt adore David and he was a
[1:00:41] man after God's Own Heart but not
[1:00:43] perfect but yet her introduction into
[1:00:47] the passage of scripture we know nothing
[1:00:49] about her before this scene well what a
[1:00:53] time for your life to be introduced into
[1:00:56] the scope of God's prophetic word and
[1:01:00] it's your introduced in a passage and a
[1:01:04] time of life to where your introduction
[1:01:07] into the Holy scripture is adultery
[1:01:11] well I say that there's some here today
[1:01:14] that were introduced into the grace of
[1:01:17] God at the same time or even worse
[1:01:21] you know I don't think that we still
[1:01:24] fully comprehend how much that we are as
[1:01:29] humans still affects us after the New
[1:01:31] Birth
[1:01:32] I'm reminded of what brother round tells
[1:01:34] us that when you make yourself when you
[1:01:37] were young and much of what you will
[1:01:40] become in life is when you are a young
[1:01:43] child
[1:01:44] that is showing the positive it is so in
[1:01:47] the negative
[1:01:48] and we know the new birth certainly
[1:01:51] changes our soul and quickens the seed
[1:01:54] of God that's down inside of us but the
[1:01:57] new birth does not destroy many of the
[1:02:01] human attributes in the human nature and
[1:02:03] you've heard me said over and over again
[1:02:05] and other brothers as well that we don't
[1:02:07] need in the body chains to just to go
[1:02:10] back to being young people but we
[1:02:13] actually need to be young different
[1:02:15] people
[1:02:16] because if I went back to being 18 and
[1:02:19] you were 18 and you were 18 can you
[1:02:22] imagine what heaven would be like in
[1:02:24] about three weeks time if we were all
[1:02:26] just young again we don't need to just
[1:02:29] be young we need to be changed because
[1:02:32] in our human makeup and our mortality we
[1:02:36] bring to God all of this baggage all of
[1:02:40] these hurts and complexes and
[1:02:43] disappointments that we all have and I
[1:02:46] know sometimes that people think well
[1:02:48] it's just the poor people and the
[1:02:50] uneducated and the people that aren't
[1:02:53] very privileged in life are the ones
[1:02:56] that have the most of the complexes but
[1:02:58] it shows me you haven't studied the
[1:03:00] message very well or you'd find out that
[1:03:03] your Prophet said one of the two times
[1:03:06] that he uses the word complexes that he
[1:03:08] identifies it with the more educated
[1:03:11] class
[1:03:12] when he said that people become so
[1:03:15] educated and they have complexes against
[1:03:18] one another because of their education
[1:03:21] so you see it's not the poor it's not
[1:03:25] the indifferent it's not the weak it's
[1:03:27] not just those who have complexes but
[1:03:30] every human being that comes on the
[1:03:33] earth is subject to fear and Trauma and
[1:03:36] complexes and scars of life
[1:03:40] and yet the new birth does not take that
[1:03:43] all away it's amazing because we see
[1:03:46] from our own Prophet is we're able to
[1:03:48] look into his life three months after
[1:03:51] the seals are open and when he preaches
[1:03:53] the sermon to us and he opens up himself
[1:03:56] in a way that he never had done before
[1:03:59] and that is standing in the Gap June the
[1:04:01] 28th I think it is 1963 and we see a
[1:04:05] view into brother branham's use and if
[1:04:08] you and to brother branham's Journey as
[1:04:10] he's growing up as a young man then as
[1:04:12] he comes into the early state of his
[1:04:15] ministry and he gives us a view inside
[1:04:17] look of himself and he helps us also to
[1:04:21] see where he was at that time three
[1:04:24] months after the seals are open one of
[1:04:27] the greatest events that had ever
[1:04:28] happened on the earth and brother random
[1:04:31] shows us a view about himself that he
[1:04:34] was fixing to come off the field he was
[1:04:36] going to basically deceive his wife talk
[1:04:40] her are into going to the North country
[1:04:42] and he was going to become a guide and
[1:04:44] the Lord told him if you get her up
[1:04:46] there she will leave you and God had to
[1:04:50] give him a dream that he knew would
[1:04:52] never happen but he had to scare brother
[1:04:54] Branham you remember the stories right
[1:04:56] you remember the tape if you haven't
[1:04:57] listened to it a while or do you good to
[1:04:59] listen to it and we see that you're as a
[1:05:01] man that not only is Born Again of
[1:05:03] course has the new birth but a man who
[1:05:06] is the prophet to the Gentiles a man
[1:05:08] who's been given an honor to be able to
[1:05:10] talk to the angels of God and see
[1:05:13] countless numbers of visions and to be
[1:05:16] the leader of a Revival that would
[1:05:18] spearhead that Revival and Lead it
[1:05:21] around the world and still a man that
[1:05:23] was still left with fears and complexes
[1:05:27] and things within his human makeup that
[1:05:30] his prophetic office did not take away
[1:05:32] the new birth did not take away anybody
[1:05:36] going to hear me this morning
[1:05:37] so what I see about Tamar what I see
[1:05:41] about Rahab what I see about Bathsheba
[1:05:44] even what I see about Mary and Mary is
[1:05:48] totally different now the other four
[1:05:50] were tainted in one way or another and
[1:05:53] Mary was not tainted in a sexual manner
[1:05:56] or anything like that but Mary is going
[1:05:58] to be greatly affected by the reproach
[1:06:02] that she will bear as an 18 year old
[1:06:05] girl of being assumed that she is
[1:06:08] pregnant out of wedlock no doubt it was
[1:06:11] a great honor and a great glory to the
[1:06:14] kingdom of God to be able to become this
[1:06:17] woman that the Bible spoke of but I
[1:06:20] wonder how much that she boy reproached
[1:06:23] in herself of being rejected and
[1:06:26] despised and people whispering about her
[1:06:29] and saying things about her and yet some
[1:06:32] of what they said seem to be true some
[1:06:35] of what they said no doubt they thought
[1:06:37] was exactly right because she was not
[1:06:40] married to Joseph yet and she was from
[1:06:42] this poor town in Nazareth which would
[1:06:45] be oh my just a terrible place to be
[1:06:48] from had an awful reputation and we look
[1:06:51] at it and we see the glory side of Mary
[1:06:54] being the Virgin but I wonder if we take
[1:06:57] into consideration The Human Side of
[1:07:00] Mary being the chosen one and when we
[1:07:03] look at Bathsheba we see a woman that
[1:07:05] was pulled away from her husband now it
[1:07:09] was not that David had fallen in love
[1:07:12] with her here the prophet picks it up
[1:07:15] exactly as Nathan did and we looked at
[1:07:17] it before how that David was given this
[1:07:20] Parable and Bathsheba was considered to
[1:07:22] be a you lamb even when the prophet
[1:07:25] Nathan gave the parable to David he did
[1:07:28] not project Bathsheba as being
[1:07:31] Australian lamb that had actually left
[1:07:35] the flock where she was supposed to be
[1:07:38] he did not project her as one that was
[1:07:41] out Meandering around and looking here
[1:07:44] and there and that is the nature of
[1:07:45] sheep sometimes sheep will do it sheep
[1:07:48] that love God and love the Lord and yet
[1:07:50] they will find themselves going here and
[1:07:52] going there and getting caught up in
[1:07:54] this or that or the other even getting
[1:07:56] caught up behind the wrong leader
[1:07:58] because it's in them to be led but yet
[1:08:01] Nathan does not project Bathsheba to be
[1:08:05] this type of you land but he projects
[1:08:08] that David was the strong dominant force
[1:08:11] and David was the one that was moved
[1:08:15] upon and by what it was his passion it
[1:08:18] was his lust and instead of David going
[1:08:21] in the proper way to be able to take
[1:08:24] care of that David saw her he did not
[1:08:27] love her he did not fall in love with
[1:08:31] her this is why that the prophet does
[1:08:33] the contrast between Uriah and David how
[1:08:36] that Uriah loved her and and Uriah had
[1:08:40] brought her up and remember Uriah was
[1:08:42] older than her and he had some children
[1:08:44] that was at home and she would had
[1:08:46] become their stepmother so there's
[1:08:49] several things about it that the prophet
[1:08:51] conveys that David did not have at all
[1:08:53] so David basically lusted after her he
[1:08:58] wanted her not because he loved her and
[1:09:00] more than like likely had she not become
[1:09:02] pregnant the story wouldn't even have
[1:09:04] went the way that it did but once he
[1:09:06] found out she was with child now he's
[1:09:08] forced to do something different and of
[1:09:11] course he winds up taking your eyes
[1:09:12] alive and yet here comes this woman now
[1:09:15] she's going to be brought into the
[1:09:17] Palace of the king I don't imagine that
[1:09:20] she just fell in love with David
[1:09:21] overnight can you imagine falling in
[1:09:23] love with a man who's murdered your
[1:09:25] husband and according to the way that
[1:09:27] Nathan conveys this it was a
[1:09:30] relationship which was not just
[1:09:32] one-sided that Nathan loved her but she
[1:09:35] also loved him so she's taken from her
[1:09:37] husband she's taken from her
[1:09:40] step-children and she's placed into a
[1:09:43] position that she was not even groomed
[1:09:45] for now she's not a king's daughter
[1:09:47] she's not a Magistrate's daughter her
[1:09:50] her grandfather was a hit the fail which
[1:09:53] was a military man her father was also
[1:09:57] one of David's chosen 30 men personal
[1:09:59] bodyguards her husband Uriah was one of
[1:10:03] those 30 men so she had a military
[1:10:06] background in her family so they were
[1:10:09] not necessary politicians they were not
[1:10:12] men that would know how to pick up a cup
[1:10:14] and pick how to pick up a spoon and a
[1:10:17] fork and and how to do all the proper
[1:10:20] curtsies and so on and so forth but no
[1:10:22] doubt they were a common type of people
[1:10:25] a type of people that knew Warfare and
[1:10:28] new pain a new anxiety and Trauma and
[1:10:31] stuff like that so she was not reared in
[1:10:34] a place to wear that she would have felt
[1:10:37] very comfortable in being right where
[1:10:40] the King was himself her clothes were
[1:10:43] would have been taken from her the
[1:10:46] clothes she would have been comfortable
[1:10:47] wearing as you know probably not even a
[1:10:50] middle class type of person her home
[1:10:52] that she would have been comfortably
[1:10:53] been raised up in and she was pulled out
[1:10:56] of that and thrown into a palace the
[1:10:59] lifestyle she was used to should totally
[1:11:02] been separated from that lifestyle no
[1:11:04] doubt she had friends friends of her own
[1:11:07] category friends of her own class and
[1:11:10] she was pulled from all of that by whom
[1:11:13] a man of authority that lusted after her
[1:11:18] now I do believe as I said to you a
[1:11:20] couple weeks ago I do believe that God
[1:11:22] had it in his program that both David
[1:11:24] and Bathsheba would have come together
[1:11:27] in time and it could have been possible
[1:11:29] that Uriah would have been killed in the
[1:11:32] exact same battle that he died in
[1:11:35] because if it was his time to go he was
[1:11:37] going to go anyway is that right but yet
[1:11:40] he would have not have went by the hand
[1:11:42] of David and God would have no doubt
[1:11:45] brung them together maybe it have been
[1:11:47] more like when Solomon would have been
[1:11:49] in the Norse country and he saw the
[1:11:51] shulamite woman and he fell in love with
[1:11:53] her but Solomon gave her time now you
[1:11:56] wonder in your mind why did Solomon when
[1:12:00] he beckoned upon the shulamite and she
[1:12:03] was a very poor girl but yet a very
[1:12:05] beautiful girl and when he saw her he
[1:12:08] did not take her immediately he did not
[1:12:11] pull her from what was her Norm but he
[1:12:14] sends people after her and gives her
[1:12:17] some time wonder why wonder why wonder
[1:12:22] if it was not from listening to his
[1:12:25] mother tell him over and over again of
[1:12:28] the trauma that she had and of the
[1:12:31] difficulty that she had in making this
[1:12:33] transition from being just an average
[1:12:36] person to be coming and some of you
[1:12:38] wonder why the grace of God is so slow
[1:12:41] dealing with us sometimes he knows what
[1:12:44] he's doing some of us may look at other
[1:12:47] people and say well why don't they do
[1:12:48] this and why don't they do that look
[1:12:51] I've learned something I ain't too smart
[1:12:52] but I've learned if God progresses
[1:12:55] people in the way he reveals himself to
[1:12:57] them I'm going to give them how much
[1:12:59] ever grace they need because God knows
[1:13:02] exactly what they're what they need and
[1:13:05] what he's doing and whether or not you
[1:13:07] understand this statement it is quite a
[1:13:09] progression to come from being an
[1:13:12] absolute wretched sinner in the world of
[1:13:15] darkness and chaos and walking into
[1:13:18] bright light immediately and making that
[1:13:21] transition overnight
[1:13:23] and sometimes it takes an element of
[1:13:26] time for people to transition and go
[1:13:28] from their friends to making new friends
[1:13:30] and going from the vocabulary change and
[1:13:33] everything about them is entering into a
[1:13:36] world they've never been before
[1:13:38] and now what is it about Solomon that he
[1:13:41] mentions the law of his mother over and
[1:13:44] over again the term mother mentioned
[1:13:46] what is it 14 times something like that
[1:13:48] in the Book of Proverbs now if this
[1:13:50] woman would have been a woman that would
[1:13:52] have been you know somebody that would
[1:13:53] look at a red light woman or something
[1:13:55] like that would say and she would have
[1:13:57] constantly been telling Solomon look son
[1:13:59] I was the wrong one I I addressed in
[1:14:02] such a way that was indecent and ungodly
[1:14:05] there's no way in the world this man
[1:14:06] could have had this love and respect for
[1:14:08] his mother I mean no even whenever she
[1:14:11] begins to ask a petition for adonaija
[1:14:13] that Solomon bounds he gets up and he
[1:14:16] bows down before his mother and he calls
[1:14:18] for a throne to be brought in and sat at
[1:14:21] his own right hand now she was the wife
[1:14:24] of David but she was the only Queen
[1:14:27] Mother and the only Queen Mother you'll
[1:14:30] find in the Old Testament that actually
[1:14:32] was given a position like she was so
[1:14:35] Solomon must have really loved and
[1:14:37] respected and honor his mother but I
[1:14:40] dare say she was not a woman without her
[1:14:43] scars I'd say in the in our congregation
[1:14:47] today of those that are present and
[1:14:49] those that are hearing the service every
[1:14:51] man woman boy and girl if you've lived
[1:14:54] very long in this life you're already
[1:14:56] bearing scars and bearing things brought
[1:15:00] on by human beings that are around you I
[1:15:04] myself a person never been tore up too
[1:15:07] bad by dogs
[1:15:09] too many cats never have offended me
[1:15:12] too many hippopotamuses now granted I've
[1:15:15] not been around that many but I have
[1:15:17] been around a few hippopotamuses and a
[1:15:19] few rhinoceroses and a few elephants and
[1:15:21] I guarantee you they can do you bad
[1:15:23] damage but like you most of my hurt has
[1:15:27] been from humans
[1:15:30] and the sad part about it is Christians
[1:15:34] Christian humans I mean it's God I've
[1:15:36] been hurt by Christians well of course
[1:15:38] we all have and yet somehow we tend to
[1:15:41] think well Christians shouldn't hurt one
[1:15:43] another wow where do you get that at
[1:15:44] Christians are human beings just like
[1:15:47] other human beings and people tend to
[1:15:51] put Christians up on a pedestal and
[1:15:53] think that Christians are free from
[1:15:55] hurting you and offending you that is
[1:15:57] simply not the truth now we do all
[1:16:00] believe that David King David was the
[1:16:02] seed of God to be not he was the seed of
[1:16:05] God he was a man after God's Own Heart
[1:16:06] done taking his life and proved to you
[1:16:08] that God used King David even after this
[1:16:11] terrible mistake as the example of kings
[1:16:14] and God was still doing for David's sake
[1:16:18] things to the kingdom of Judah even
[1:16:21] after David had been dead buried and his
[1:16:24] bones had gone back to the dust of the
[1:16:26] earth and God was still quoting for
[1:16:28] David my servant's sake so David yet was
[1:16:32] the one who inflicted all the this pain
[1:16:35] and all this trauma and God even showing
[1:16:38] David's position that David had made
[1:16:40] such a terrible mistake that he had cast
[1:16:42] a stumbling block before the enemy so
[1:16:45] natural When leaders make a mistake it's
[1:16:48] going to be more detrimental than it
[1:16:50] will be just a layperson and probably
[1:16:53] every one of us here today not only bear
[1:16:56] the the scars and the things of
[1:16:58] complexes and Trauma about others but
[1:17:01] probably if we've lived very long we'd
[1:17:04] probably call some herself
[1:17:07] oh my goodness wasn't near as many amens
[1:17:11] I I I think probably most of us have
[1:17:15] wound up offending other people now I'm
[1:17:18] not talking about offending him for the
[1:17:20] word sake my goodness I've offended all
[1:17:22] kinds of people for the word sake but I
[1:17:24] do want to say this morning if I've
[1:17:26] offended or ever heard anyone in any way
[1:17:28] or cause anyone a complex in any way me
[1:17:32] the man Donnie Reagan then I pray you
[1:17:35] would forgive me anyone around the world
[1:17:38] anyone in my family anyone that I've
[1:17:41] ever met because I myself also know that
[1:17:44] pain and God knows that it would never
[1:17:47] be my desire to hurt I want to try to
[1:17:50] help and heal if I can isn't that your
[1:17:53] desire now how is it then that Bathsheba
[1:17:56] was able to become from all of this to
[1:18:00] where she was brought into the kingdom
[1:18:02] this way and still maintain the ability
[1:18:05] to be a woman that was so renowned that
[1:18:09] she would have this influence upon her
[1:18:11] son now remember whenever we read this
[1:18:13] that Solomon whenever he wrote about
[1:18:16] this he said this was to the King Lemuel
[1:18:19] King Lemuel this was the prophecy which
[1:18:24] was talked to him by his mother so here
[1:18:28] she actually Bathsheba is actually
[1:18:31] allowed to enter in and not just be the
[1:18:34] wife of a king and the queen mother but
[1:18:37] she's actually allowed to enter into a
[1:18:40] prophetic state of the word and when you
[1:18:42] read these first few words that she said
[1:18:45] to Solomon and these are words that he
[1:18:47] pinned down that she said to him she was
[1:18:50] actually prophesying and warning Solomon
[1:18:53] ahead of time of what was going to
[1:18:56] happen to him now remember brother
[1:18:57] Branham like and Solomon to the first
[1:19:00] church age which was the Ephesian
[1:19:02] churches I don't know if you know this
[1:19:03] or not but there were actually seven
[1:19:05] ages seven Church ages in the Old
[1:19:07] Testament so according to the prophet so
[1:19:10] there were seven churches just in the
[1:19:12] Old Testament and they began there with
[1:19:14] Solomon so Solomon was the Ephesian age
[1:19:17] because it was a new era it was a new
[1:19:20] time and Solomon was the man that built
[1:19:23] the house of God but those of you that
[1:19:24] know your Bible know that the same man
[1:19:26] that built the house of God some years
[1:19:28] later he married an Egyptian princess
[1:19:31] which was the daughter of one of the
[1:19:33] Pharaohs and then he married another
[1:19:35] daughter of another king and the
[1:19:37] daughter of another king and the
[1:19:38] daughter of another king and of course
[1:19:40] these were mainly for political Alliance
[1:19:43] by which he and Israel will be safe
[1:19:45] instead of trusting in the Lord and
[1:19:48] whenever he would do that these women
[1:19:49] were not converts they were not like
[1:19:51] Roots they were not like Tamar they were
[1:19:54] not like Bathsheba but they still
[1:19:56] maintain their ideology and they were
[1:19:59] Idol worshipers so the same man that
[1:20:02] built the beautiful house of God wound
[1:20:04] up building a house for kimas wound up
[1:20:07] building a temple for the ammonites a
[1:20:09] house here and there and there and the
[1:20:12] very same man that built the house of
[1:20:14] God built these and what was he a type
[1:20:16] of the New Testament Ephesian Church age
[1:20:19] that he got away from his first love God
[1:20:22] loved him so much that he renamed him
[1:20:25] from the name of Solomon and he called
[1:20:27] him Jedediah the Beloved of the Lord and
[1:20:31] Lemuel King Lemuel the beloved one or
[1:20:34] the one that is loved by God so here he
[1:20:37] Bears this name and he got away from the
[1:20:40] first love and his mother inspired by
[1:20:43] the spirit of God able to move Beyond
[1:20:46] her fears able to move Beyond feeling
[1:20:49] uncomfortable in such a place but you
[1:20:52] know how we are as humans oh my God may
[1:20:55] be calling us to do a work for him and
[1:20:57] we really don't like it it don't feel
[1:20:59] comfortable to us you imagine it was
[1:21:01] comfortable for brother Branham leaving
[1:21:03] what he was comfortable with moving to
[1:21:06] Arizona you imagine it was comfortable
[1:21:08] for the prophets when they had to walk
[1:21:10] into the courts of the the king and
[1:21:12] indict those kings and all of their
[1:21:14] Courts for the the rebellion and
[1:21:17] Disobedience imagine it was comfortable
[1:21:19] you think it was comfortable for the
[1:21:21] Lord Jesus and they stripped him naked
[1:21:23] and whipped him and beat him until the
[1:21:25] strips of mate hanged down from his back
[1:21:28] no my friend it was not comfortable at
[1:21:30] all so the Lord truly calls us sometimes
[1:21:33] out of our comfort zone into doing
[1:21:36] things for him he will call you to be
[1:21:39] reproached for his word he will call you
[1:21:43] to Bear a burden sometime that you wish
[1:21:46] was not yours so for those who are
[1:21:49] looking for a Christianity that allows
[1:21:51] you to remain in your comfort zone well
[1:21:54] let me just say this to you this morning
[1:21:55] you're probably in the wrong church here
[1:21:57] today
[1:21:58] because we preach the cross and not just
[1:22:02] the Cross of Christ we preach ours you
[1:22:05] see nearly every Christian Church
[1:22:07] preaches the Cross of Christ and they
[1:22:10] think they'll be saved by preaching his
[1:22:11] cross but Jesus talked about your cross
[1:22:14] more than he talked about his own so I
[1:22:17] don't want to just preach his cross but
[1:22:19] I'm going to preach about yours and I
[1:22:21] want to preach about mine and not only
[1:22:23] do I want to preach about it but I want
[1:22:26] us to be able to Bear it until one day
[1:22:28] God will set us free from that cross now
[1:22:32] remember that Bathsheba bringing all of
[1:22:34] this baggage if I can say it that way
[1:22:36] into this position a position she never
[1:22:39] asked for a position she never wanted
[1:22:42] and you can imagine now she's married to
[1:22:44] King David and she doesn't really love
[1:22:47] him she's still in love with her dead
[1:22:49] husband so she's trying to be nice to
[1:22:52] this man because as he brought her in he
[1:22:55] can also throw her out so how do you
[1:22:57] fall in love with some man who has
[1:23:00] killed your husband how do you fall in
[1:23:02] love with a man who's taken you away
[1:23:04] from your step children how do you fall
[1:23:07] in love with a man who's totally removed
[1:23:09] you from everything that you were used
[1:23:11] to and everything that was comfortable
[1:23:13] to you but yet no doubt she felt that it
[1:23:16] was something that moved within her now
[1:23:19] unlike David our lord Jesus he did kill
[1:23:22] our first husband
[1:23:25] amen he did kill our first chosen when
[1:23:28] we agreed to let him go and remember
[1:23:30] your first husband the prophet said was
[1:23:32] your nature which had the rule over you
[1:23:35] and by spiritual deaths laying on the
[1:23:38] altar of God the holy fart of God come
[1:23:40] down and consumed him and released us
[1:23:43] from the marriage of that first husband
[1:23:46] and remember had he done that before you
[1:23:49] were willing you would have been a
[1:23:51] captive as well but once he wooed upon
[1:23:53] your soul and got your soul to agree
[1:23:57] with his word than you and the old
[1:24:00] Hallelujah your soul your desire inside
[1:24:03] of you agreed with God's word and you
[1:24:07] gave God permission to annihilate that
[1:24:10] old nature of yours and you were
[1:24:13] released then from the marriage of that
[1:24:16] first husband but it's still new to us
[1:24:18] and the thing of it is many of us have
[1:24:20] been serving the lord for many many
[1:24:22] years many of you been serving for 30 40
[1:24:24] 50 60 years and yet as far as your
[1:24:27] Humanity you're still dealing with it
[1:24:29] this morning just like it was the day
[1:24:31] after you got saved anybody's be honest
[1:24:34] and say Amen brother Donnie that's the
[1:24:36] truth now will you say when will I ever
[1:24:38] get rid of it in the morning of the body
[1:24:41] change that's when we will all lay aside
[1:24:44] all the depths of our Humanity well you
[1:24:48] say why Carol and I was talking another
[1:24:49] day about this and she said wouldn't it
[1:24:51] have been wonderful if God would have
[1:24:53] just took all of our human element away
[1:24:55] and just done away with it all of us
[1:24:57] again one sense of the word it would
[1:24:59] have been but it wouldn't have been his
[1:25:01] program and we would not have overcome
[1:25:03] and the greatest thing you know people
[1:25:05] say if I could get rid of this smoking
[1:25:07] if I could get rid of this drinking if I
[1:25:10] could get rid of this or that you said
[1:25:11] that's my problem no it's not your
[1:25:14] problem is yourself
[1:25:15] you are your greatest enemy
[1:25:19] will anybody say Amen to that again
[1:25:22] you imagine brother Branham saying his
[1:25:24] greatest enemy was William Branham how
[1:25:27] many believes that was the truth well if
[1:25:29] his greatest sin and he was himself then
[1:25:31] what do you figure yours in my wife
[1:25:33] brother Donnie my husband brother Donnie
[1:25:35] it's you brother Donnie nope all three
[1:25:37] guesses are wrong it's yourself so the
[1:25:40] reason today we're not any closer to God
[1:25:43] is whose fault is it my fault what if
[1:25:45] it's my fault please forgive me if it's
[1:25:48] your wife's fault I pray you'd forgive
[1:25:50] her but if it's your fault you're going
[1:25:52] to forgive yourself or what are you
[1:25:53] going to do with yourself
[1:25:55] or are you going to admit it well I
[1:25:57] might as well just admit it it's me why
[1:26:00] is it I don't read the Bible more it's
[1:26:02] me why don't I listen to tapes more it's
[1:26:04] me why don't I love more why don't I
[1:26:07] shut my mouth on Facebook instead of
[1:26:10] airing out our family's Dirty Laundry
[1:26:12] well come on church Preach with me now I
[1:26:15] think folks have gone crazy in the last
[1:26:16] day they're they're posting things out
[1:26:19] there you think what in the world is the
[1:26:20] matter with people they're totally
[1:26:22] insane
[1:26:23] well of course I know it's got to come
[1:26:25] to that way but I want you to see that
[1:26:28] God when he saves us and he eradicates
[1:26:30] that nature that we're born with that
[1:26:33] God does not go into the human makeup
[1:26:35] and change the human makeup and
[1:26:38] automatically set the nature of God in
[1:26:41] the human makeup so in brother random's
[1:26:43] family run this thing of a temper now
[1:26:46] when brother Brandon was a little boy
[1:26:48] and this man had killed his dog you
[1:26:50] remember the story and brother random
[1:26:52] got the 22 rifle and he was going to go
[1:26:54] kill this man well Hallelujah is this
[1:26:57] right I know a lot of the message people
[1:26:59] don't like to hear stuff like this but
[1:27:01] you know what God called me to preach
[1:27:03] the message all of it not just pet
[1:27:06] quotes all of it
[1:27:08] I thank God Brethren said those things
[1:27:10] it allows us to see a side of him and
[1:27:13] yet God used him look at David God did
[1:27:15] not throw David out of the economy of
[1:27:17] God because of his mistakes so we see
[1:27:20] this strain that ran in the Branham
[1:27:22] family while was it it was a temper and
[1:27:24] he said he's eaten many a meal out of a
[1:27:27] straw now why because he had a temper
[1:27:30] and he would come back and fight and say
[1:27:33] that is that right oh my goodness
[1:27:35] friends I didn't blaspheme the Holy
[1:27:37] Ghost I'm just saying what he said
[1:27:38] that's what you all want me to say and
[1:27:40] he all want me to say what he said or
[1:27:42] not
[1:27:43] well but did that stop God from using
[1:27:46] the man of course not and do we see that
[1:27:49] still raising up in him from time to
[1:27:51] time we do and God looking at this about
[1:27:54] brother random knowing that he was a man
[1:27:56] but yet God still had a great great plan
[1:27:59] for his life and I think that Bathsheba
[1:28:02] and and what she was able to display in
[1:28:05] the genealogy being great great great
[1:28:07] grace so on grandmother of the Lord
[1:28:09] Jesus that it shows to us that a person
[1:28:12] can bring all of their baggage as you
[1:28:14] will and they're able to let God take
[1:28:18] all that they are and mold them and
[1:28:20] shape them into something that is far
[1:28:22] beyond what they thought they could ever
[1:28:25] be or Bathsheba could have been the type
[1:28:27] of woman well I don't like King David I
[1:28:30] don't like this house I don't like this
[1:28:32] food I don't like this I don't like that
[1:28:34] no doubt she had a lot of things to
[1:28:36] dislike about being called in this
[1:28:38] situation she didn't want to be an
[1:28:40] adulteress it was not her desire yet she
[1:28:43] became him and adulteress to the power
[1:28:46] of an overpowering man a man that
[1:28:49] projected his will over her and forced
[1:28:52] her into becoming an adulteress and for
[1:28:55] many of you that have read the Bible
[1:28:57] Decades of your life until the last few
[1:29:00] weeks you have looked down on this woman
[1:29:03] many of you just like myself have
[1:29:07] thought very little of this woman and we
[1:29:10] were accusing a woman that was innocent
[1:29:13] herself and yet probably some of you saw
[1:29:16] when I get to heaven and I run into
[1:29:18] Bathsheba I'm turning going the other
[1:29:20] way I don't want to shake her hand I
[1:29:22] don't want nothing to do with her but it
[1:29:24] wasn't that Bathsheba was wrong it was
[1:29:26] our sinking that was wrong well that
[1:29:29] kind of makes me wonder about maybe
[1:29:31] people we go to church with and people
[1:29:34] around the message or even sometimes our
[1:29:37] own family members if we don't get them
[1:29:39] wrong in our mind and we imagine this
[1:29:42] and that and the other now don't sit
[1:29:43] there and look at me like a bunch of
[1:29:45] sinless saints with no no Faults and no
[1:29:48] shortcoming y'all are just as low down
[1:29:50] and rotten and stinking and no good in
[1:29:53] your flesh as David was
[1:29:55] and me and anybody else if it wasn't for
[1:29:57] the grace of God that wouldn't be one of
[1:29:59] us saved today but thank God for Grace
[1:30:02] but Bathsheba is her contribution to me
[1:30:06] and looking at this is what a person can
[1:30:09] bring into the economy of God not with a
[1:30:13] perfect scenario and the perfect
[1:30:15] background and the perfect with
[1:30:17] everything working together what did I
[1:30:19] bring to God oh my goodness I brought
[1:30:22] complexes I brought fears I brought this
[1:30:25] that the other what did many of you
[1:30:27] bring many of you brought memories in
[1:30:30] your mind of being molested or or being
[1:30:33] defiled as the prophet said that
[1:30:35] Bathsheba was by King David you brought
[1:30:39] into it that no trust at all no trust at
[1:30:42] all for a man there's women in this
[1:30:45] message that have absolutely no trust
[1:30:47] whatsoever for any man I'm talking about
[1:30:50] their husband their father their uncle
[1:30:52] and they just about don't even trust God
[1:30:55] because God is a man and what brought
[1:30:57] that on because of things in their life
[1:31:00] and maybe instances by which which they
[1:31:03] were so innocent and I know for some of
[1:31:06] you this is painful for me to even bring
[1:31:08] this about Bathsheba and the time of
[1:31:11] woman she was because some of you did
[1:31:14] not have such a mother I know that and
[1:31:16] it hurts me for you to have to bring
[1:31:19] this to you but the thing I'm saying is
[1:31:21] this we can take all of these things
[1:31:23] that we are and we can feel sorry for
[1:31:26] ourselves and pull ourselves away from
[1:31:29] their body and away from the economy of
[1:31:31] God and just be an island and well
[1:31:34] nobody needs man I don't need nobody I'm
[1:31:36] not sure exactly where you got that at
[1:31:38] but your own body testifies that you
[1:31:41] believe a lie now what if your heart
[1:31:43] done that your heart decided I'm sick
[1:31:45] and tired of you kidneys I'm sick and
[1:31:48] tired of you bladder I'm sick and tired
[1:31:50] of you this and that and the other I'm
[1:31:52] walking out of your body today I hope
[1:31:54] and pray to God it don't cause I'll be
[1:31:55] burying you on Tuesday well what if your
[1:31:58] kidneys does the same thing what if your
[1:32:00] brain does the same thing but God put
[1:32:02] them there together so say you've got
[1:32:04] high blood pressure and your heart's
[1:32:06] good well your heart said this is such a
[1:32:08] strain on me and your brain says this
[1:32:10] ain't fair this ain't right it's your
[1:32:12] kidneys it's calling that blood pressure
[1:32:14] it's because you're eating too much salt
[1:32:15] that's what it is and it's this not
[1:32:17] another and you're making it hard on
[1:32:19] every one of the rest of us members it
[1:32:21] ain't my fault the eye would say it
[1:32:23] ain't my fault the ear would say but you
[1:32:25] get up with high blood and what do you
[1:32:27] do when you get up with high blood the
[1:32:29] tips of your ears which was what I am
[1:32:31] and you caused me to be red and
[1:32:33] everybody's looking to me and say want
[1:32:34] to what's the matter with hell want to
[1:32:36] watch the matter with her and it's not
[1:32:38] the tips of your ears fault it's
[1:32:40] something else's fault well should the
[1:32:42] ear sink because of that I'm leaving you
[1:32:44] I'm divorcing you I'll no more be your
[1:32:47] ear you're not taking care of your blood
[1:32:49] pressure you're humiliating me you're
[1:32:51] embarrassing me when you get to your
[1:32:53] your temper under control and you get
[1:32:55] this under control let me know and I'll
[1:32:57] come back and be attached I wonder how
[1:32:59] many earless people they'd be sending
[1:33:01] you this morning
[1:33:02] I wonder how many of us if all of our
[1:33:05] organs except for our tongue say you
[1:33:07] constantly are getting me in trouble and
[1:33:10] the thing that's done it is that big fat
[1:33:12] long tongue stuck in your mouth and that
[1:33:15] tongue of yours talks me in and out of
[1:33:17] one mess and another please brother
[1:33:20] Dominique
[1:33:21] well what if every one of your members
[1:33:23] left and all you had was a tongue or
[1:33:26] some of you'd probably be happy
[1:33:28] since you use that remember more than
[1:33:30] anything else
[1:33:32] oh my but what do they do each one
[1:33:36] relies upon the other
[1:33:38] so you see when God put the Kaleidoscope
[1:33:42] of the Gentile matriarchs blending
[1:33:45] together what was it that Ray had to
[1:33:48] could contribute being Ohana and what
[1:33:51] could Tamar contribute and what now can
[1:33:54] Bathsheba contribute to the making
[1:33:57] together of not only just the Lord Jesus
[1:33:59] body the first time but also the
[1:34:02] prophecy of a gentile bride you see when
[1:34:06] we get there that day I imagine we are
[1:34:08] going to be so overwhelmed of the people
[1:34:11] that we know in this life and we get
[1:34:15] there and they were up and down and had
[1:34:18] such difficulties in life and the things
[1:34:20] they went through and you're saying poor
[1:34:22] saying you know they had this trauma and
[1:34:24] that trauma I dare say for him if every
[1:34:27] one of us went to some psychologists and
[1:34:29] psychiatrists somewhere that have every
[1:34:32] one of us in therapy tomorrow beginning
[1:34:34] with me
[1:34:37] and people think therapy is the answer
[1:34:39] for everything well I'll tell you what's
[1:34:42] the answer for everything that is God's
[1:34:44] word
[1:34:45] now am I against therapy I'm not against
[1:34:48] therapy as long as the therapy don't go
[1:34:49] contrary to the word of God but let me
[1:34:52] tell you something there is no greater
[1:34:55] thing that can reach to us than the
[1:34:58] preaching and the hearing of God's word
[1:35:01] so it helps us instead of making an
[1:35:03] excuse for being the way that we are
[1:35:05] well I'm this way and I was raised this
[1:35:08] way and I can't help it and a lot of
[1:35:10] times it becomes one excuse after
[1:35:12] another I wonder who proverbs 31 would
[1:35:15] be written about if Bathsheba would have
[1:35:18] took that attitude to the Palace if she
[1:35:21] would have come in and said I don't want
[1:35:22] to be here I don't like David I don't
[1:35:25] like the meals to eat I don't like the
[1:35:27] clothes I've got to dress up every day
[1:35:29] she probably just remember dressing up
[1:35:31] going to parties and going to this that
[1:35:33] another now she's got to dress up and
[1:35:35] she's got to walk around crucified and
[1:35:37] she's got a curtsy and she's got to do
[1:35:39] this and that another it changed her it
[1:35:43] changed her you see this is one thing
[1:35:45] that God demands of the Bride that the
[1:35:48] church world will never have to do they
[1:35:50] can go ahead and dress however they want
[1:35:52] to they I call they want to they can
[1:35:54] live any way they want to but not you
[1:35:56] because you are the bride and you are
[1:36:00] invited to a powerless life you have to
[1:36:04] talk the way they do in the palace you
[1:36:07] have to eat Palace food you have to all
[1:36:11] glory to God you have to dwell the
[1:36:13] clothes they wear in the palace we are
[1:36:16] not like the world we are not of the
[1:36:19] world we don't talk like them act like
[1:36:22] them behave like them we are called to
[1:36:25] powerless life
[1:36:32] oh
[1:36:34] so let's read this now
[1:36:37] again Psalms 31 10 Proverbs rather who
[1:36:41] can find
[1:36:42] a virtuous
[1:36:44] woman
[1:36:46] her prize
[1:36:48] is far above
[1:36:50] rubies
[1:36:52] and this is Bathsheba
[1:36:59] verse 11 of the heart of our husband
[1:37:02] does safely trust in it this could not
[1:37:04] be said about an adulteress
[1:37:10] where did Solomon get this input
[1:37:14] no doubt his mother told him over and
[1:37:16] over again
[1:37:18] now son
[1:37:19] me and your father
[1:37:21] were not joined right
[1:37:23] but God in his Mercy
[1:37:26] called us to himself
[1:37:29] and God ordains you to be here
[1:37:33] you see many folks they come to the Lord
[1:37:36] they're married to three times in the
[1:37:38] world they're all messed up with this
[1:37:40] and that and the other
[1:37:41] and they come to God
[1:37:43] and they live under that past their
[1:37:45] whole life
[1:37:47] and they have this thing within them
[1:37:50] it's like everybody is looking at them
[1:37:52] and the truth of it is 85 percent of the
[1:37:54] church don't even know what they're
[1:37:55] doing
[1:37:56] and they don't really care because
[1:37:57] they've got just as bad a past
[1:37:59] themselves
[1:38:00] but where is the problem at it lays
[1:38:03] within that individual and they think
[1:38:06] everybody's looking at them they think
[1:38:10] everybody knows this and that and the
[1:38:12] other about it's one of the reasons some
[1:38:14] of you all ain't never shouted
[1:38:16] is because you're so scared of what
[1:38:18] people will say
[1:38:20] [Music]
[1:38:21] well the reasons some of y'all are so
[1:38:24] calm and so collective in church
[1:38:27] and this is some of y'all you're Wild on
[1:38:30] a buck in the house of God when you go
[1:38:34] you're beside yourself
[1:38:37] calm down calm down
[1:38:39] and what hinders us what people think
[1:38:44] I hope to God we get to a place before
[1:38:46] the Rapture when we're not so much
[1:38:49] concerned about what mother Joneses say
[1:38:51] I don't care what the Joneses or the
[1:38:53] Smiths or the balls or the Weber's or
[1:38:56] the Reagans or the anybody else's say if
[1:38:59] the Holy Ghost moves on men anoints my
[1:39:01] feet guess what's going to happen I'm
[1:39:03] going to dance before the Lord I'm going
[1:39:05] to clap my hands I'm going to raise my
[1:39:08] voice why I'm living Palace life and we
[1:39:13] dance in the palace with the King
[1:39:17] Hallelujah we eat all Hallelujah we eat
[1:39:21] what the king sets before us
[1:39:24] we worship we adore the king I ain't
[1:39:27] worried about the Joneses
[1:39:34] I also see in Proverbs 31.
[1:39:39] not just Bathsheba
[1:39:42] but the bride
[1:39:45] of Christ
[1:39:48] who can find
[1:39:51] a virtuous woman
[1:39:53] her price is for
[1:39:56] above rubies
[1:39:58] the heart
[1:40:00] of her husband
[1:40:02] doth safely Trust
[1:40:04] in her
[1:40:07] Jesus Christ had confidence in you
[1:40:12] by allowing you to live in this age
[1:40:17] well if you can understand me today his
[1:40:18] heart does trust in you that shall come
[1:40:22] through laodicea unscathed
[1:40:25] will you be hurt will you be let down
[1:40:27] when you've been disappointed you will
[1:40:29] but you refuse like Bathsheba to light
[1:40:33] your past dictate your future
[1:40:40] you see even the things that happen to
[1:40:42] brother random as a little boy
[1:40:45] whenever he was made fun of and
[1:40:47] ridiculed and his father of course if
[1:40:50] the moon shines still and by the random
[1:40:52] scent to get water and what a strange
[1:40:54] appearance of the Lord to come down and
[1:40:57] a bush or in the trees rather that time
[1:40:59] in the trees and he heard the wind and
[1:41:02] it was the voice of a supernatural being
[1:41:05] and him on a journey to get water for a
[1:41:08] moonshine still
[1:41:10] God can pick some of the strangest
[1:41:12] places to visit these people can he
[1:41:15] and yet brother Brown being rejected and
[1:41:17] brother Branham being laughed at him
[1:41:19] made fun of and all of that and yet he
[1:41:22] did not let that control him did it
[1:41:23] bother him sure it still bothered him as
[1:41:25] as a man that was now up in his ears in
[1:41:29] his 50s in 1963 and yet it was something
[1:41:32] that he dealt with but it never
[1:41:34] controlled him remember that Sheba was
[1:41:38] scarred and my goodness the prophet said
[1:41:40] whenever he got to Heaven he wanted to
[1:41:42] walk down them streets I read it again
[1:41:44] last night and take a hold of uriah's
[1:41:47] hand and shake his head and thank him
[1:41:49] because he was such a strength to him in
[1:41:51] this life's journey
[1:41:53] well I'd say praise the Lord for Uriah
[1:41:56] and I'm going to walk up and grab a hold
[1:41:58] of the hand of bathsheb and say God
[1:42:00] bless you sis I need you to forgive me I
[1:42:02] preached you as a bad woman I've done
[1:42:04] this and that in other words you know
[1:42:05] what I've seen the light God bless you
[1:42:06] Sister
[1:42:08] well praise the Lord don't sit there and
[1:42:10] look at me some of y'all's going to be
[1:42:11] right behind me it'll be the whole Happy
[1:42:13] Valley Word of Life we are now it'll be
[1:42:15] the whole group of a sister by Hashima
[1:42:16] God bless you forgive me since Sebastian
[1:42:18] but forgive me God bless you she's going
[1:42:19] to say what in the world happened to
[1:42:21] that and the Lord's going to save us
[1:42:22] that David series done he preached
[1:42:26] but then we can look at these people and
[1:42:29] we say how great how wonderful I wonder
[1:42:31] were they so great
[1:42:35] I wonder if they were not people just
[1:42:37] like
[1:42:39] you know
[1:42:42] people with failures
[1:42:45] you imagine the embarrassment and the
[1:42:47] shame when David would take a hold of
[1:42:49] her hand and she become his favorite
[1:42:52] wife
[1:42:54] grabbing her by the hand and said come
[1:42:56] and walk with me to the window no David
[1:42:58] no I feel so ashamed I feel
[1:43:01] please don't make me do that
[1:43:03] I can't do it Bathsheba you're my wife
[1:43:07] but they'll all remember what I was
[1:43:10] they'll all remember how I became your
[1:43:12] wife
[1:43:14] I I I I I I keep doing please David
[1:43:18] don't you are my wife come with me and
[1:43:21] stand at the window
[1:43:24] you imagine as the people but yay David
[1:43:27] May the King live forever God bless our
[1:43:30] King
[1:43:33] and the few said God bless our Queen
[1:43:36] sorry outfit
[1:43:39] low down a rotten woman
[1:43:42] terrified
[1:43:44] David wouldn't have never done that if
[1:43:46] she hadn't done what she done
[1:43:50] um
[1:43:52] I wonder sometimes in our
[1:43:54] self-righteousness
[1:43:55] so we sit around in size people up
[1:44:02] on what Scholars he's got
[1:44:05] I wonder what he's got
[1:44:08] you ever noticed him he's kind of weird
[1:44:11] she's kind of strange
[1:44:15] they may think you're weird
[1:44:21] and then we read in the Bible of these
[1:44:23] great characters and we just oh my oh
[1:44:28] when I get to heaven I'm gonna walk up
[1:44:32] to David I I'm gonna man you wait till I
[1:44:35] see exit you wait till I see Jehoshaphat
[1:44:37] you wait till I see do you understand
[1:44:40] you were going to church
[1:44:42] with some of the same type
[1:44:47] if there was a book of Acts written some
[1:44:51] of the people that you go to church with
[1:44:53] would be those people's names
[1:44:56] do you understand some of the preachers
[1:44:57] that we're privileged to hear and
[1:44:59] privileged to know are some of the
[1:45:01] modern day heroes they are the men that
[1:45:05] are warring against Satan oh my goodness
[1:45:08] the men of God that have stood for
[1:45:10] decades and shepherded the flock and
[1:45:13] saints of God that have prayed in people
[1:45:15] that have done so much for the economy
[1:45:17] of God and we're looking way back here
[1:45:20] for a hero and looking way over here for
[1:45:22] a hero and sitting right by
[1:45:30] but our fears
[1:45:33] and our complexes
[1:45:35] I know
[1:45:36] I know I
[1:45:39] know I know what it's like when a
[1:45:41] preacher will pick you up at the airport
[1:45:44] and you get in the car with him to ride
[1:45:47] and you watch every move his hand makes
[1:45:50] I know what that's like
[1:45:54] I know what it's like whenever you pull
[1:45:57] up to a drive-through or in a restaurant
[1:45:59] or anywhere else
[1:46:00] and I see people looking at me for very
[1:46:03] long
[1:46:05] and my face goes to getting red I was
[1:46:08] sitting at a hunting lodge in Illinois a
[1:46:09] couple years ago
[1:46:10] the guy at the end of the table he was
[1:46:12] eating supper

[1:46:23] preacher

[1:46:25] eyeing me said

[1:46:36] brother Daniel started to staring the
[1:46:38] conversation another way brother Daryl
[1:46:40] started telling Tales they started going
[1:46:41] this and that and the other why
[1:46:44] they could see my my face turning red
[1:46:48] I could feel my ears
[1:46:51] a few my ears wanted to leave too

[1:48:48] to the Gentile body of God
[1:48:53] Rahab Ruth Bathsheba Tamar they
[1:48:57] contributed
[1:48:58] to making
[1:49:00] the genealogy of Jesus
[1:49:06] what a woman
[1:49:08] she will do him good
[1:49:11] and not evil all the days
[1:49:14] of her life
[1:49:16] I love this quote your sisters Look Away
[1:49:19] to Jesus the prophet says talking about
[1:49:21] his wife he said she always
[1:49:23] sent my clothes to the cleaners and
[1:49:24] washed my shirts had everything ready
[1:49:27] for me to go into a meeting and then she
[1:49:28] wonders how she can serve God
[1:49:32] you women as you serve your husband
[1:49:34] you serve God
[1:49:38] wow
[1:49:42] my brother I've been doing that already
[1:49:44] I know
[1:49:45] and you know the sad part about it is
[1:49:48] you've been waiting to arrive
[1:49:50] at your place your adoption is a
[1:49:53] daughter of God when one way one day
[1:49:55] you're going to do whatever it is you
[1:49:56] think you're going to do
[1:49:59] and you've already
[1:50:01] been doing it
[1:50:03] some of your brothers are waiting until
[1:50:05] you'll step out one day and control the
[1:50:07] elements
[1:50:13] now here's the ones God wants you to
[1:50:15] control

[1:50:18] know that I've tried to control the wind
[1:50:20] the wind tornadoes and storms and all
[1:50:22] that now I just head for the truck as
[1:50:24] fast as I can
[1:50:26] [Laughter]
[1:50:29] I figure if I can control this 16 right

[1:50:33] grace of God I'll leave the lightning
[1:50:35] and the Thunder to the Lord let me just
[1:50:36] bring Donnie subject to the word you
[1:50:38] know Fran we're looking for some Utopia
[1:50:40] we're looking for something way out
[1:50:42] yonder I hope God helps us to see in 23
[1:50:45] that it ain't something way out yonder
[1:50:47] it's right here in front of us right now
[1:50:50] if you can leave this place today
[1:50:52] knowing by God's grace I'm gonna bring
[1:50:56] me under control and I'm going to
[1:50:59] realize I'm going to serve my husband if
[1:51:01] I'm married I'm going to live from my
[1:51:04] family if I'm a father I'm going to be a
[1:51:06] good Christian I'm going to do what God
[1:51:08] wants me to do I'm not going to wait
[1:51:10] till 40 years down the road I'm doing it
[1:51:13] this morning I'm doing it this morning

[1:51:19] [Applause]
[1:51:23] oh no
[1:51:26] brother man said you women as you serve
[1:51:28] your husband you serve God
[1:51:30] and then I come in all tired and wore
[1:51:32] out people coming from everywhere and I
[1:51:34] have to go out somewhere on a fishing
[1:51:36] trip or a hunting trip
[1:51:40] why many women would have blown up at
[1:51:42] that
[1:51:44] what'd she do
[1:51:45] got in the hunting clothes ready for me
[1:51:48] to go
[1:51:49] and let me go
[1:51:52] and yes sister media was not the one
[1:51:54] that stood on the platform and discerned
[1:51:56] and the angel came to
[1:51:59] I don't mind telling you
[1:52:01] I long for the day to be able to see her
[1:52:03] reward
[1:52:04] she's going to have a great reward God
[1:52:07] calls Preachers Wives are going to have
[1:52:08] a great reward oh you see the preacher
[1:52:12] when he's in Victory she deals with him
[1:52:13] when he's down in the valley of the
[1:52:14] shadow of death whenever he feels like
[1:52:17] nobody loves him and nobody cares for
[1:52:19] him and you're just so happy and you're
[1:52:21] rejoicing because you were so hell oh
[1:52:23] thank God for preacherous wives that
[1:52:25] stand behind her don't you thank God for
[1:52:27] your wife Brothers don't you thank God
[1:52:29] for a good Godly mother you young men
[1:52:32] and young ladies don't you thank God for
[1:52:34] a mother that loves you aren't you glad
[1:52:36] you've got a mother that don't sell your
[1:52:39] body out to the world aren't she glad
[1:52:41] your mothers didn't make sex slaves out
[1:52:43] of you and turn you over to the darkness
[1:52:46] of this world and you're looking for a
[1:52:48] woman of proverbs 31 let me tell you
[1:52:50] something we've got them sitting here
[1:52:51] today from this side all the way around
[1:52:53] to this side women of character women of
[1:52:57] virtue women that are invaluable we've
[1:53:00] got them all around this world and this
[1:53:03] message produced says this type of women
[1:53:07] [Applause]
[1:53:15] notice verse 13 let me find a pleasure
[1:53:18] to stop
[1:53:20] she seeketh War
[1:53:22] and flax
[1:53:24] and work us willingly
[1:53:27] with her hands
[1:53:29] now what I find amazing is the way that
[1:53:30] Solomon projects about his mother never
[1:53:32] remember she's a queen
[1:53:34] but it ain't like she just sitting
[1:53:36] around and ding ding ding
[1:53:37] [Music]
[1:53:39] could you bring me this could you bring
[1:53:41] me that could you dress me I read the
[1:53:44] other day where the king of England ah
[1:53:47] the King of England couldn't even put
[1:53:49] his own britches on
[1:53:50] he couldn't even put toothpaste on his
[1:53:53] toothbrush
[1:53:55] and I said well I'm just so glad I ain't
[1:53:57] royal
[1:54:01] you imagine you can't even put your
[1:54:02] socks on you can't even put toothpaste
[1:54:05] on your toothbrush and that's what it is
[1:54:07] to be royal brother sister that's what a
[1:54:09] lot of folks think Christianity is you
[1:54:12] know the Lord they as soon as they pray
[1:54:13] God's supposed to answer as soon as they
[1:54:15] ask why God's supposed to tell them why
[1:54:17] you're in the wrong loyalty you belong
[1:54:19] in England in this royalty you're Royal
[1:54:22] because of the bloodline amen you have
[1:54:26] to fight your way you've got to press
[1:54:28] when you don't feel I press it and
[1:54:31] that's the difference between Earthly
[1:54:32] royalty and Heavenly royalty you believe
[1:54:36] him even when he doesn't answer your
[1:54:38] prayer you call upon his name and it
[1:54:40] seems like he turns to death here but
[1:54:43] you serve him anyhow
[1:54:45] [Applause]
[1:54:49] oh
[1:54:50] notice there's not a reluctance there
[1:54:54] so shishika's wall in flags and workers
[1:54:57] willingly in her hands so this Priceless
[1:55:00] woman
[1:55:02] is a worker well that's sowing or
[1:55:05] cooking or mending
[1:55:09] oh Jesus
[1:55:11] sowing and cooking
[1:55:13] ugh
[1:55:17] well
[1:55:18] she's Faithfully doing her share it's
[1:55:23] not a matter of compulsion
[1:55:26] but a matter
[1:55:27] of compassion
[1:55:31] going to church today
[1:55:33] I reckon
[1:55:37] shoot if I know there's going to be this
[1:55:38] and I swearing with the Dollywood
[1:55:43] but I guess I'll go to church
[1:55:45] you know the deacons all they'll call us
[1:55:47] if we miss three or four times
[1:55:49] and then they turn the big dog loose on
[1:55:51] us and he'll call us he don't want to
[1:55:53] know who we are well we do that because
[1:55:55] we love you
[1:55:58] are you going to live right today I've
[1:56:00] been thinking about it I'm sleeping on
[1:56:02] it but the bride says oh Lord what can I
[1:56:05] do for you today
[1:56:07] oh Jesus how can I reflect your light in
[1:56:10] a little greater way
[1:56:11] I've just found it so amazing
[1:56:15] that all the different workers that have
[1:56:17] been over at our place working and you
[1:56:19] know you run into all kinds of different
[1:56:21] people they find out that I'm the
[1:56:22] preacher and then when they wake up from
[1:56:24] passing out because some preachers do
[1:56:26] actually work which they just can't
[1:56:27] hardly believe then that so you you the
[1:56:30] future you're the master said yep I've
[1:56:32] had I don't know how many of them to
[1:56:34] tell me I'm looking for a church
[1:56:37] I ain't satisfied where I'm going
[1:56:40] you know does that mean they're all
[1:56:42] bright no but what it shows me is
[1:56:44] there's even a hunger among people I
[1:56:47] hear that's not bride and they don't
[1:56:49] know where to go so they're looking at
[1:56:51] this church and looking at that church
[1:56:52] and looking at another church and yet
[1:56:54] here we are by the grace of God setting
[1:56:57] around the truths of the hour and
[1:56:59] becomes so dilatory sometimes
[1:57:02] oh my it should not be compulsory that
[1:57:05] we worship God all right let's have
[1:57:08] everybody praise God now it should be a
[1:57:11] compassion inside of our heart it should
[1:57:13] not be a compulsion that we're going to
[1:57:15] church that we're going to do right it
[1:57:17] should be such a desire the prophet said
[1:57:20] if God is in your heart you can't wait
[1:57:23] till them doors open to get there it
[1:57:25] should not be the deacons Society of the
[1:57:28] pasture is after you it's a compassion
[1:57:30] for almighty God because you are a woman
[1:57:35] affect you
[1:57:44] this woman
[1:57:45] loves her husband so much
[1:57:49] she seeks to please him
[1:57:52] let me just read a couple more verses
[1:57:53] and we'll pick it up next time
[1:57:55] she is like the Merchant's ships
[1:57:59] she brings her food
[1:58:02] from afar
[1:58:04] so she acts like a merchant if she buys
[1:58:07] anything for the household
[1:58:10] it's like she Imports and she exports
[1:58:15] so she don't stand around give me give
[1:58:17] me give me give me give me give me give
[1:58:19] me give me give me
[1:58:21] but she's willing to put forth an effort
[1:58:24] she's willing to be like a ship so the
[1:58:27] bride is like a merchant ship
[1:58:30] so she brings preachers in from Zimbabwe
[1:58:33] she brings them in from Virginia
[1:58:35] she brings them in from here and from
[1:58:37] there she Imports and she also exports
[1:58:40] so she don't just calm as something on
[1:58:43] her mind what can you do for me how can
[1:58:45] you help me today how can you help me
[1:58:47] but it's brother what can we do for you
[1:58:49] what can we do for the body today what
[1:58:52] can you do for this church
[1:58:54] what can you contribute
[1:58:58] she arises while it is yet night
[1:59:01] and give us meat to her household
[1:59:04] and a portion
[1:59:05] to her maidens she consider us a field
[1:59:10] and bias it with the fruit of her hands
[1:59:13] she planteth a Vineyard and we're
[1:59:15] talking about a queen
[1:59:18] wow
[1:59:20] God help us
[1:59:22] how many wants to be a virtuous bride
[1:59:26] to our lord Jesus
[1:59:28] the spirits together
[1:59:36] righteous God
[1:59:40] so we have our
[1:59:43] heads bowed to the dust of the Earth
[1:59:45] from whence we were taken
[1:59:48] we stand here today flawed
[1:59:51] like every other human being that's ever
[1:59:53] lived on the earth except for yourself
[1:59:57] and Adam before his fall
[2:00:01] Lord I pray you would help each of us
[2:00:03] too
[2:00:05] take the life of this woman
[2:00:09] it's amazing that you
[2:00:12] were not ashamed
[2:00:14] to have the heart at Rahab
[2:00:16] Linked In Your human genealogy
[2:00:21] Timar
[2:00:23] slay with her
[2:00:25] father-in-law
[2:00:27] oh God ruse or moabitus
[2:00:31] Bathsheba
[2:00:33] on a forced adulteress
[2:00:37] oh Lord God
[2:00:39] to be there's such a picture there that
[2:00:41] you want us to see today
[2:00:44] we can waste so much of our years of Our
[2:00:47] Lives saying well if my father hadn't
[2:00:49] done this to me and if my mother hadn't
[2:00:51] done that and if I'd been more loved at
[2:00:53] home and if I'd have been more
[2:00:54] appreciated and if I hadn't been so hurt
[2:00:57] by this preacher and if I hadn't been so
[2:00:58] let down by that preacher and this
[2:01:00] person we can spend all of our time
[2:01:03] focusing on that
[2:01:05] or we can be like Bathsheba
[2:01:08] we can be a bride type
[2:01:11] of a woman of great virtue
[2:01:14] we've all been hurt we've all been
[2:01:16] disappointed let down in people
[2:01:19] but Lord God the question is what are we
[2:01:22] going to do after our disappointment
[2:01:24] what are we going to do with our lives
[2:01:27] all we can gather them all together and
[2:01:29] take all the pieces to this therapist
[2:01:31] and then that therapist and another
[2:01:33] therapist and then we find out some of
[2:01:34] them therapists are having therapy
[2:01:35] themselves so we think and then we've
[2:01:38] got people like that trying to advise us
[2:01:39] are they any better off than we are
[2:01:41] so Lord
[2:01:43] we're the only one you know of that
[2:01:45] don't need no therapy
[2:01:48] Hallelujah
[2:01:49] so today we'd like to bring
[2:01:52] All We Are
[2:01:53] into your presence
[2:01:57] oh I wish I could erase memories of my
[2:02:00] failures
[2:02:02] I wish I could erase
[2:02:04] memories of hurts just like some of
[2:02:07] these people no doubt do
[2:02:10] and we know many many more that will
[2:02:12] stream this service
[2:02:14] as I've already been hearing from them
[2:02:16] around the world
[2:02:19] as Carolyn and I said
[2:02:21] not so many years ago
[2:02:23] in our study and heard the story
[2:02:26] of a sister in our assembly
[2:02:30] what she had went through what she had
[2:02:31] suffered
[2:02:33] I was totally overwhelmed
[2:02:37] Carolyn and I talked about it for days
[2:02:39] afterwards and we still talk about it
[2:02:41] even though it's been years ago that we
[2:02:42] heard the story
[2:02:45] because the sister was the type of a
[2:02:47] woman
[2:02:48] that should never pick it up on her that
[2:02:50] she'd been through all of this and that
[2:02:52] and the other it's the type of story
[2:02:54] that Hollywood would love to make a
[2:02:56] movie out of
[2:02:57] was so much danger and so much trauma
[2:03:00] stuff that was unbelievable
[2:03:04] and I wept as I heard the story
[2:03:07] but then I rejoiced as I seen the grace
[2:03:10] of God
[2:03:11] and what it had done for that sister
[2:03:14] that she had not let it dominate her
[2:03:16] life
[2:03:19] praise be to God
[2:03:21] help us Jesus would you come by this way
[2:03:24] today
[2:03:25] really I don't think there's a better
[2:03:27] way for us to begin the new year
[2:03:30] Lord may you take our hurts and our past
[2:03:35] Lord and I hear some of our people how
[2:03:38] they talking
[2:03:40] they're so down on themselves and so
[2:03:42] negative about themself
[2:03:45] it's evident
[2:03:47] it's evident they've been fed that maybe
[2:03:50] since a child maybe parents that didn't
[2:03:52] love them parents that rejected them
[2:03:53] whatever more
[2:03:55] and their evaluation of themself is so
[2:03:58] low
[2:03:59] [Music]
[2:04:00] Lord God I pray you would help each of
[2:04:02] us today
[2:04:04] oh we're not preaching arrogance and
[2:04:06] nothing that we can be proud of in
[2:04:07] ourself
[2:04:08] but help us to realize
[2:04:10] we have another life other than what our
[2:04:12] father gave us
[2:04:14] we have another life other than what our
[2:04:16] mother
[2:04:17] printed Upon Us Lord God
[2:04:20] it's your life Lord Jesus
[2:04:23] oh I have Bathsheba would have come in
[2:04:25] the economy of God and her husband would
[2:04:28] have died and her and David would have
[2:04:30] met at some great Kings banquet he would
[2:04:33] have politely asked her to dance with
[2:04:36] him and she would have listened to him
[2:04:38] sing a song and they would have carried
[2:04:40] on a romance of a year or so everything
[2:04:43] would have been all up front my how
[2:04:45] loving they'd had a big royal wedding
[2:04:49] she would have been able to walk into
[2:04:50] the palace and hold her head up high
[2:04:54] but instead
[2:04:56] it was shadowy it was sinful
[2:04:59] it must have took Grace every time she
[2:05:02] stepped up there to hold her head up
[2:05:04] and know that God had forgiven her
[2:05:06] husband
[2:05:08] Hallelujah
[2:05:10] unlike her today Lord God we don't need
[2:05:13] for our husband to be forgiven it's
[2:05:15] simply us
[2:05:17] oh Jesus we worship you this morning
[2:05:20] Father
[2:05:22] we bring our baggage we bring all that
[2:05:25] we are her hurts her pains our scars
[2:05:28] Lord God we bring them before you today
[2:05:30] Jesus do we have regrets so many many
[2:05:33] but Lord we don't want our regrets to
[2:05:35] dictate the type of life we're going to
[2:05:37] live neither do we want our our past to
[2:05:39] dictate it but may we be like Bathsheba
[2:05:42] that we refuse to let our past dictate
[2:05:44] our future and also our present
[2:05:51] although maybe there's some here today
[2:05:52] who need forgiveness for something
[2:05:55] they've done something they've
[2:05:56] participated in that was not pleasing to
[2:05:59] you may this spirit of God wrap them in
[2:06:02] your arms today Lord Jesus
[2:06:05] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:06:08] oh Lord God
[2:06:10] we know many times it's much easier to
[2:06:13] accept your forgiveness than it is for
[2:06:15] us to forgive ourselves
[2:06:17] but Lord God it's time that we arise as
[2:06:21] the people of God
[2:06:23] this is our time
[2:06:26] Hallelujah we are the actors on the
[2:06:29] scene as it were
[2:06:31] I don't believe there is another
[2:06:32] generation I believe with all of my
[2:06:34] heart no doubt Moses and Elijah are on
[2:06:36] the Earth today no doubt the Antichrist
[2:06:38] the false prophet the Beast that power
[2:06:41] is already here
[2:06:42] and Lord we're the last ones
[2:06:45] oh Jesus May our history Fade Out like
[2:06:49] Bathsheba
[2:06:51] now we jump ahead a few years King David
[2:06:54] is laying on his bed
[2:06:57] his oldest son Idol Niger has now said
[2:06:59] that he's King
[2:07:02] the prophet comes to who
[2:07:05] Bathsheba
[2:07:07] the prophet comes to Bathsheba
[2:07:10] and tells Bathsheba go to David
[2:07:15] Hallelujah
[2:07:17] so now here is this Outcast of a woman
[2:07:21] [Music]
[2:07:23] what is she her words are linked
[2:07:27] glory to God to the reign of King
[2:07:31] Solomon
[2:07:32] and Bathsheba walks into Kings David
[2:07:35] rule did not you my Lord say that my son
[2:07:37] would be yes yes I said that well even
[2:07:40] now I don't know is saying that he's
[2:07:43] going to be the king immediately Nathan
[2:07:46] the prophet comes in and says the same
[2:07:48] thing so the bride and the prophet was
[2:07:50] saying the same thing and what was it
[2:07:53] about the coming Kingdom Hallelujah
[2:07:57] Hallelujah the prophet comes in and
[2:08:00] David is so moved it's the last thing
[2:08:02] that he does on his deathbed Hallelujah
[2:08:06] at the bidding of who his Queen
[2:08:10] Bathsheba Queen who found honor
[2:08:14] who'd found respect
[2:08:17] Who Am I who am I who should I go in
[2:08:19] there but somehow it had come to her she
[2:08:21] was God's chosen one in her words lay
[2:08:25] the power of life
[2:08:28] and David called for Solomon and said by
[2:08:31] my decree Solomon is King
[2:08:36] of Israel
[2:08:38] oh Lord Jesus help us as your people
[2:08:42] we believe our weddings suffer that we
[2:08:45] will go away in that three and a half
[2:08:47] years we will rise from that supper and
[2:08:51] we will come back in the battle of
[2:08:52] Armageddon and then what's going to
[2:08:54] happen our presence with you at that
[2:08:57] battle declares it's time for the son of
[2:09:01] David to reign

[2:09:06] you don't bring Angels you don't blame
[2:09:09] cherubims you don't bring seraphims but

[2:09:14] your wife
[2:09:17] and your wife will Crown you King of
[2:09:20] Kings
[2:09:21] and Lord of lords as it was bathsheb
[2:09:24] according to the Song of Solomon it was
[2:09:27] Bathsheba who made the crown
[2:09:30] and put on Solomon's head
[2:09:34] Hallelujah you're crowned by his mother
[2:09:38] oh Jesus may we lay our faults our
[2:09:41] failures our mistakes
[2:09:44] Lord God not only that but may we lay
[2:09:46] our judgmental spirits of one another oh
