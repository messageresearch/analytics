[7:38] If it were not true, I would have told
[7:42] you so.
[7:44] Just a little while to linger here
[7:47] below.
[7:49] Then I'm getting ready to leave this

[8:45] Oh, that's the truth. Give the Lord a
[8:48] good hand clap of praise if you love him
[8:50] this morning.
[8:52] Thank you, Lord. And that's not just
[8:55] singing the words of a song. I believe
[8:57] that's reality. We're getting ready to
[8:59] leave here. Aren't you glad about it
[9:01] this morning? Look at your neighbor and
[9:02] tell them you're glad to see him in the
[9:04] house of God today. Praise the Lord.
[9:07] What a privilege it is to be in church
[9:10] to worship the Lord in spirit and in
[9:12] truth. Amen. Have any visitors in our
[9:16] midst today? I already have seen some uh
[9:20] in our midst. We want to say we welcome
[9:22] you to uh our assembly today. Trust
[9:25] you'll just receive a a tremendous
[9:27] blessing from being here. We're really
[9:28] glad to have you. All of our streamers
[9:31] locally and around the world, we want to
[9:32] say we welcome them to this service
[9:35] today, too. Let's give all those folks a
[9:38] good hand this morning if you would.
[9:43] Praise the Lord. Brother Paul Phillips,
[9:45] if you get ready to pray this morning
[9:46] over the prayer request, Sister Sandy
[9:49] Baggot wants us to remember her niece's
[9:51] baby. He has been in the NICU for four
[9:55] weeks having feeding difficulties. So,
[9:58] they're asking that we would remember
[9:59] that child. We'll remember them as we
[10:01] pray today. Pray for Fred Walton's
[10:04] family. you passed away yesterday. That
[10:06] was brother Randy Walton's brother. So,
[10:08] we want to remember that family in
[10:10] prayer. Brother Terry Stockton says he
[10:12] wants to thank the church family for
[10:14] praying uh for his surgery on his eye. I
[10:17] it was very successful and I sure
[10:18] appreciate the prayers. Please pray for
[10:21] Jerretta having a lot of pain in her
[10:23] left leg. Thank you. God bless. So, we
[10:26] just commit those needs unto the Lord.
[10:28] Sister Barbara Grley's cousin was
[10:30] involved in a motorcycle accident and is
[10:32] currently in critical condition. Let's
[10:35] just remember him as we pray today. Want
[10:37] to remember uh
[10:42] Gertrude has a a very sore problem knee.
[10:46] Uh Gson Katrina Girtson's I believe is
[10:49] the name sends that in from Canada. So
[10:52] hope I got that name close to right.
[10:54] Let's remember those folks as we pray
[10:56] today. I want to pray for Sister Becky
[10:58] Lynch, sick, unable to be in the house
[11:00] of the Lord. Uh Sister Angie Brown says
[11:03] to please pray for me. Just some things
[11:05] going on with some folks. She's just
[11:07] asking the Lord to intervene and and let
[11:10] everything be resolved. And I we just
[11:13] believe he's able to do that, don't we?
[11:15] Amen. All the unspoken prayer requests,
[11:17] we just commit all these things unto the
[11:19] Lord. Let me make a couple of
[11:21] announcements real quickly. We're
[11:22] accepting changes, additions, and
[11:25] deletions for the upcoming church
[11:27] directory. Beginning today, we will
[11:29] accept changes until Wednesday, October
[11:31] the 15th. Please come by the library for
[11:34] more information. And due to ongoing
[11:37] construction and equipment at the
[11:39] playground area, we're asking the
[11:41] parents to keep your children away until
[11:43] it is completed. We anticipate it to be
[11:46] fully completed and open by the end of
[11:49] next week. Thank you for your
[11:50] cooperation. So, let's remember that.
[11:52] Let's sing that little chorus one more
[11:54] time as brother Paul gets ready to pray.
[11:56] We're getting ready to take a trip.
[11:59] &gt;&gt; We're getting ready, as brother Donnie
[12:00] says so many times, the world's biggest
[12:02] youth meeting. You're going to be part
[12:05] of it.
[12:06] &gt;&gt; Now, you may be a little aged this
[12:08] morning, like a lot of us are, but
[12:11] you're fixing to be young again. Are you
[12:14] glad about that?
[12:15] &gt;&gt; Are you glad to be getting rid of all
[12:17] these old aches and pains and troubles?
[12:19] We're getting ready to leave this world.
[12:21] Sing me one more verse of that and then
[12:23] we'll do the chorus.
[12:25] To prepare a mansion, Jesus said, "I'll
[12:30] go."
[12:31] If it were not true, I would have told
[12:35] you so.
[12:37] Just a little while to linger here
[12:40] below.
[12:42] Oh, I'm getting ready to leave this
[12:47] world. I'm getting ready to leave this
[12:52] world. I'm getting ready for the gates
[12:58] of world. Keeping my record dry,
[13:02] watching all day and night. I'm getting
[13:07] ready to leave this world.
[13:14] You know, there's a man had a dream one
[13:16] time and he dreamed
[13:20] there were two fields and there was a
[13:21] fence between the field. One side of the
[13:24] fence was the devil. The other side was
[13:28] Jesus Christ. The devil said, "You have
[13:32] to make a choice." He said, "If you
[13:34] choose me, I'll give you prosperity.
[13:36] I'll give you happiness. I'll give you
[13:37] joy. I'll give you a lot of fun. But if
[13:40] you choose him, I'm going to destroy
[13:41] you. I'm going to do everything I can to
[13:44] just destroy you. I'll take all your
[13:47] happiness away. I'll put everything I
[13:50] can away in your life. But you got to
[13:53] make the choice. The guy said, "I'll
[13:56] tell you what. I'm going to sit on the
[13:57] fence. I'll get a little bit of this and
[13:58] a little bit of that." That lasted for a
[14:01] while. Then everything went dark.
[14:04] The devil came to grab him. He said,
[14:07] "No, no, stop. You can't take me. I
[14:11] never chose you. He said, "Too bad. I
[14:14] own the fence."
[14:18] &gt;&gt; Think about that.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; Let's remember these prayers and all
[14:22] your requests on your heart as we pray.
[14:27] Our gracious heavenly father,
[14:30] Lord, I
[14:33] think of this nation where we're at
[14:36] right now.
[14:37] situation with Charlie Kirk and the
[14:39] family.
[14:41] But I think of each and every one of us
[14:43] here, we know it's real close to time.
[14:46] We better be getting ready to go. If
[14:49] anyone here is sitting on the fence,
[14:53] Lord, help them to choose you and get
[14:55] ready to go. Help this to be the
[14:57] service, Father God, they commit their
[15:00] life to you, Jesus, fully.
[15:04] Father God, each of these requests,
[15:05] there's one had an accident and one
[15:08] recovering from surgery, different sick
[15:11] ones and different very needs, each and
[15:14] every need on the heart here.
[15:17] Father God, I ask that you speak to each
[15:19] need.
[15:21] Go and heal the brokenhearted,
[15:24] but most importantly, heal the soul.
[15:26] Father God, you know what it takes.
[15:29] Forgive us each and every one of our
[15:31] sins. Help us to be ready for your
[15:34] service. Be with brother Donnie the
[15:37] remainder of this service and every part
[15:39] of it. For we ask this in your name, the
[15:41] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother. God bless you,
[15:45] brother. Appreciate you. Praise the
[15:47] Lord. Ushers, if you'd like to come at
[15:49] this time, receive the morning tithe and
[15:51] offering. Let's sing a little song.
[15:52] We've sang it a lot, but I like to hear
[15:54] Brother Harry do the verses really,
[15:56] really well. And he does them really,
[15:59] really well. So, it's hard to believe
[16:01] he's 65 years old, isn't it?
[16:04] It really is. He just sings so good to
[16:07] be that old.
[16:10] We love you, buddy. See the bright light
[16:13] shine. Praise the Lord.
[16:18] Brothers, if you could pull that up. The
[16:20] bad part about being that old is I can't
[16:22] remember what key we do it in.
[16:25] M. That seems low. But
[16:28] don't you love him?
[16:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:32] &gt;&gt; Are you ready to go? I'm sick of this
[16:34] world.

[32:27] God's been so good to me.

[33:41] [Music]
[33:47] There's nothing in this world
[33:50] that is worth living for.
[33:54] It only leaves you empty and longing for
[33:59] more.
[34:01] He's the only reason I live.
[34:06] But oh, what a reason.
[34:13] [Music]
[34:15] You may try
[34:17] a lot of things
[34:21] to find real happiness.

[34:28] But if you look very long, then you know
[34:35] it can't be found.
[34:40] [Music]
[34:42] But when you find the Lord and the power
[34:48] of his holy spirit,
[34:52] his holy spirit,
[34:56] he'll be your reason to live and he will
[35:01] never ever ever lead you down.

[36:16] more.
[36:18] He's the only reason I live.
[36:25] Yes, he's the only reason I live.
[36:30] But oh, what a reason.
[36:37] [Music]
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Do you honestly know of another reason?
[36:55] &gt;&gt; People live for pleasure. They live for
[36:58] sin. live for all types of different
[37:01] things,
[37:03] but this is the only reason
[37:06] that can give you eternal life.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Cars, money, fun, sin, all those sorts
[37:14] of things.
[37:16] Yeah. Never give you eternal life. Don't
[37:19] you love him today? Amen.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that he's not a a doctrine,
[37:25] you know, he's not a theology, but he's
[37:28] a person.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; A person. Let's read about him today.
[37:34] What do you say?
[37:37] Second Peter chapter 1 verse two.
[37:46] I was talking to Carol the other day on
[37:48] the phone. I was out here working a
[37:50] little bit.
[37:51] And I told her while I've been working,
[37:53] I've been praying and
[37:55] concentrating and thinking about the
[37:57] Lord.
[37:59] And I told her, I said, "You know, we
[38:00] talk about it and we hear people talk
[38:02] about it a lot
[38:05] about wanting more of the Lord in our
[38:08] lives. We want more of Jesus. We need
[38:11] more of Jesus. We need more of him."
[38:14] And I told her, I said, "I've been
[38:16] looking at this on the statue of a
[38:18] perfect man for a good while now." And I
[38:21] told her, I said, "I'm really wondering
[38:23] if what we're longing for isn't more of
[38:27] himself
[38:29] living out of us." Because we say
[38:32] wanting more of him, what's that mean?
[38:33] More power,
[38:35] more anointing, more more what? More
[38:38] miracles, more signs, more wonders. We
[38:41] believe in all that, don't we? But will
[38:45] most of you get more miracles in your
[38:47] life?
[38:48] Will most of you start having prayer
[38:50] lines and praying for the sick? And most
[38:53] of you won't.
[38:55] What about more traveling around the
[38:58] world and being missionaries? Most of
[39:01] you won't.
[39:03] But can all of you,
[39:06] including me, get more of this?
[39:10] And actually, when we get this, we're
[39:13] getting him.
[39:17] Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[39:20] through the knowledge of God and of
[39:22] Jesus our Lord
[39:24] according as his divine power hath given
[39:26] unto us all things that pertain unto
[39:29] life and godliness which means to be
[39:33] like God through the knowledge of him
[39:36] that hath called us to glory and virtue
[39:39] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[39:41] great and precious promises
[39:45] that by these you might be partakers
[39:48] of the divine nature,
[39:50] having escaped.
[39:53] Escaped,
[39:55] which means we were held in prison by
[39:58] it.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; But we escaped.
[40:02] Thank God Jesus held the key to the door
[40:05] and let us out,
[40:07] &gt;&gt; having escaped the corruption that is in
[40:09] the world through lust.
[40:13] And beside this, giving all diligence,
[40:15] add to your faith virtue, and to virtue
[40:17] knowledge, and to knowledge temperance,
[40:20] and to temperance patience, and to
[40:22] patience godliness, and to godliness
[40:26] brotherly kindness,
[40:28] and to brotherly kindness
[40:30] charity. Let's read verse six again. And
[40:34] to knowledge, temperance, and to
[40:35] temperance patience, and to patience
[40:38] godliness.
[40:40] and to godliness,
[40:42] brotherly kindness. And to brotherly
[40:45] kindness, charity.
[40:49] How many to be remembered today?
[40:54] Lord Jesus, as we bow our heads to the
[40:57] dust of the earth from once our bodies
[40:59] were taken.
[41:02] Dear God, we realize that
[41:05] if all we have is just mortal life,
[41:09] how wretched we would be.
[41:13] As Paul said, we sorrow not as others
[41:15] who have no hope. For if we believe that
[41:17] Jesus died and rose again and would also
[41:20] sleep in Jesus will God bring with him
[41:23] when he comes.
[41:26] Lord, that's our hope. It's not in this
[41:28] life only.
[41:30] As we endeavor to look into your word
[41:32] today, I pray you'd open our hearts, our
[41:36] understanding, certainly our minds. Our
[41:39] minds are a channel of course, but more
[41:42] importantly than that, may the spirit of
[41:44] God strike our souls and help us to be
[41:48] recipients of the word. Help me, Lord
[41:50] Jesus, that I can get out of the way.
[41:53] Speak to us, Father, what's on your
[41:55] heart today.
[41:58] What is on your heart for our church
[42:01] today?
[42:03] What is on your heart for our lives? for
[42:06] this service.
[42:08] I want to hear from you today, Jesus.
[42:11] We've not come to hear from a man. Man
[42:14] can't help us very much, but we're to
[42:16] hear from you. Speak to us, Father. In
[42:20] the name of the Lord Jesus, we ask it.
[42:23] Amen. God bless you, saints. You may be
[42:26] seated.
[42:33] So godliness
[42:36] means to be like God. H.
[42:41] So humans
[42:45] are ask of the Lord Jesus to be perfect
[42:51] as your father in heaven is perfect.
[42:54] And then Peter comes and says that we're
[42:56] to be like God.
[43:00] Paul says that we're endeavor to keep
[43:02] the bond of the spirit and the unity of
[43:04] the faith. And then says to receive
[43:06] charity which is the bond of
[43:09] perfectness.
[43:12] That sounds like a pretty tall order,
[43:14] doesn't it?
[43:15] That almighty God would ask of us
[43:17] mortals which were born in sin and born
[43:20] lost. And then even after we're saved,
[43:24] full of so many faults and shortcomings.
[43:28] I mean, it still has faults and
[43:30] shortcomings and flaws and
[43:32] imperfections.
[43:34] All of us do. Those of you that didn't
[43:35] raise your hand, I can see one of your
[43:36] biggest ones lying.
[43:42] And yet God, it's like God doesn't even
[43:45] look at that when he says what he wants
[43:48] us to be.
[43:51] God doesn't even look at our faults and
[43:53] our flaws and say, "Well, I I I
[43:55] understand that. And because you've got
[43:56] so many, I I'm going to make a special
[43:59] exception for you. And I'm going to say
[44:02] that you don't have to have that." No,
[44:04] he doesn't. If he did, there wouldn't be
[44:06] anybody there cuz we've all got them.
[44:08] Got them. And our lives are so filled
[44:10] with some. And yet Paul in First Timothy
[44:14] here, he says, "And without controversy,
[44:17] great is the mystery of godliness." I
[44:20] know you've read this many times, but
[44:22] did you notice that he did not say,
[44:24] "Great is the mystery of God,
[44:28] &gt;&gt; but godliness."
[44:31] Now, without a shadow of a doubt, the
[44:33] mystery of God is tremendous. It's a
[44:35] wonderful thing. But here he's focusing
[44:38] on something else, something a little
[44:40] different than just theos, which is the
[44:43] godhead, but godliness.
[44:47] Then he goes into the key of how that
[44:50] you and I are going to be able to do
[44:51] this. God was manifest in the flesh. God
[44:55] was manifest in the flesh. That's the
[44:58] key. God was manifest in the flesh.
[45:04] Human weakness.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Human weakness. The Lord Jesus feared
[45:11] death. The Lord Jesus was tempted by
[45:14] women. The Lord Jesus was tempted by
[45:17] drinking.
[45:18] The Lord Jesus prayed to dodge the
[45:22] cross.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Great is the mystery of godliness.
[45:28] God manifested in flesh, justified in
[45:33] the spirit, seen of angels, preached
[45:35] into the Gentiles, believed on in the
[45:37] world, and received up into glory. So to
[45:41] be have this attribute or this virtue as
[45:45] the prophet called it of godliness
[45:48] is to be like God in what way? Now you
[45:53] say, "Brother Donnie, but we're so
[45:55] fallen from that image. Truly we are."
[45:58] But those that are born again actually
[46:01] have already crossed into another
[46:03] dimension. And according to what Paul
[46:06] said, we've been translated into the
[46:08] kingdom of his dear son, which gives us
[46:12] godlike characteristics and traits. So
[46:17] what is God? God is light. God is a
[46:20] spirit. God is a consuming fire. God is
[46:23] many, many things. And then John
[46:26] encapsulates it all in first John and
[46:29] said God is love. So God is not just
[46:33] loving.
[46:35] God is not just loving.
[46:39] But God is love, which is not the same
[46:42] thing.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Now you see as a Christian, I don't want
[46:46] to just be loving.
[46:49] Christians should not just desire to be
[46:52] loving that we can love people and we
[46:55] can love this and love that. We should
[46:58] have a desire greater than just to be
[47:01] loving and that is to be love.
[47:05] Now I want to be loved. Anybody here
[47:07] want to be loved too? We want to be
[47:09] loved by families and friends and and
[47:12] people. We want to be loved. But I want
[47:14] to be more than loved. I want to be
[47:17] love. Now there are degrees of course of
[47:21] love. And the prophet typed it to us
[47:22] like a great fountain of stream that
[47:25] come from eternity. And then the further
[47:26] it got from him, the more impure that it
[47:30] became. So God is not the author of much
[47:33] of what we hear today. That is love. But
[47:35] it's come down from the purity of the
[47:37] fountain. And the further it comes away
[47:39] from him, the more filthy it becomes. So
[47:43] people can love all kinds of things and
[47:46] all kinds of people, but it doesn't mean
[47:48] that that is the love of God. So God is
[47:52] not only love but God is a lover. So God
[47:58] is a lover. And because he is love that
[48:03] attribute demands that he moves into the
[48:07] characteristic and the trait of being a
[48:10] lover. Now we also if we're going to be
[48:13] godlike, we must also be lovers. But
[48:17] lovers of what? Well, if any man loves
[48:19] the world, the love of the father is not
[48:22] in him. So that lets us know father God
[48:25] does not love the world which is cosmos
[48:28] world order. He does not love the order
[48:31] of the day. God does not no he does not
[48:35] become a part of the agenda of the left
[48:37] or the right whichever way you lean
[48:39] politically. But God is a lover. So what
[48:43] does he love? He loves things of his own
[48:46] kind and of his own nature. And yet he
[48:50] can love sinners, love sinners, and hate
[48:54] their sin. So God is a lover. Notice
[48:58] this. The prophet said, "God is a lover.
[49:00] God is love." So God's loved the world
[49:03] when they were unlovable. That he gave
[49:06] his son to make them lovable. Here it
[49:10] is. God wants to come down to make love
[49:13] to you. He's seeking, thirsting,
[49:15] hungering, trying to get some of your
[49:18] starchy hearts to make love to you as a
[49:22] love affair. So God don't want church to
[49:24] be a ritual, a routine. Well, we going
[49:26] to church today, I guess. So it's Sunday
[49:28] morning. We might as well go. You're not
[49:31] a lover. You're not a lover. If you're
[49:33] in love with God, you can't wait till
[49:34] them doors open to be able to get here.
[49:37] So he wants it as a love affair, not a
[49:39] law, but love. It's all in love. God so
[49:44] loved. Again, he says, "My prayer is for
[49:46] the church that we can have such love to
[49:49] will love people when they love us not."
[49:54] That's what the church needs today is to
[49:57] express a love even to a man that could
[50:01] spit
[50:04] in your face.
[50:06] spit in your face and you could still
[50:11] not from a hypocritical standpoint, but
[50:15] from your heart pray for that man's
[50:18] soul. And the church said,
[50:21] &gt;&gt; how many can say, "Lord, help me." Mhm.
[50:24] Lord, help me. Notice again he says, "If
[50:26] you can just love those who love you,
[50:29] the sinners do the same thing. But we're
[50:32] different." Now sinners can love their
[50:34] own kind. And it's easy to see, friends,
[50:37] that we're living in a world that is so
[50:39] full of hate. Now, this is the
[50:41] phenomenal thing to me about it. Many,
[50:43] many people, and now naturally by
[50:45] relative birth, it's easier for us to
[50:48] hate sometimes than it is to love. But
[50:51] there's some people who hate that
[50:54] actually never become hate. But they
[50:57] just hate, but they don't become hate.
[51:01] But when you become hate, it's hate to
[51:06] the deepest dimension that it can go. So
[51:09] you actually become so full of hate that
[51:14] you despise. Then what do you do? You
[51:16] enter into a phase of murder because
[51:20] that's what Cain did to his brother
[51:22] Abel. So Cain looked at that. He hated
[51:26] what he done. He hated that Abel was
[51:28] accepted. And we can certainly see that
[51:31] in the age we're living in. My goodness,
[51:33] you can't even differ with people on
[51:35] your politics and let them live. We've
[51:38] seen what it's done even in our own
[51:39] nation. People killing one another
[51:42] because they differ with sin in
[51:44] politics. Yet, does everybody do that?
[51:47] They don't. But some people will become
[51:50] hatred to such a degree that they
[51:53] actually enter in and become hate. Well,
[51:56] that tells me if they can do that under
[51:59] the influence of darkness, what about
[52:01] people that are filled truly with the
[52:04] Holy Ghost, cannot they move into a
[52:07] realm that they just don't love, but
[52:10] they actually become love. Yeah.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; If a sinner can become a hate to such a
[52:16] degree, they would kill. They would
[52:19] murder anyone that would disagree with
[52:22] them. Anyone that would get in their way
[52:24] of whatever they want to do or want to
[52:26] accomplish yet everybody doesn't do
[52:28] that. Thank God. Not yet anyway. Why?
[52:31] Because they hate but they've not become
[52:34] it yet. And many people love. They even
[52:38] love God. Prophet said they could 1965.
[52:41] You could love and even love God and
[52:44] still be lost. Why? They've entered into
[52:47] the very beginning stages of love. And
[52:50] they love God from their human spirit.
[52:52] They love him. They really do. And they
[52:55] want to be a Christian. They don't want
[52:57] to be lost. But yet, do they become
[53:00] love? Now, we're talking about bride
[53:03] material. And it's the same way with
[53:05] those that Satan will get to carry out
[53:08] his most vile and most wicked things.
[53:11] You see, Satan only mimics God. So, he
[53:14] sees that God gets a hold to certain
[53:16] people and they they move beyond just
[53:19] going to church and being good people
[53:21] and paying their tithes and helping the
[53:23] widows. They actually become the very
[53:26] essence of what God wants them to be.
[53:29] Others just kind of hang around the
[53:31] fringes. And Satan thought, "That's a
[53:33] great idea. I'm going to do some of my
[53:35] people the same way. I'm going to let
[53:37] some of them just kind of hang around."
[53:40] And you know, they they'll be lost,
[53:41] they'll wind up being lost just like the
[53:43] others. But I'll need some that'll
[53:45] become so engrossed with me and my
[53:49] program and my agenda and what I want if
[53:52] I I'm going to need some humans that'll
[53:55] kill other humans. I'm going to need
[53:57] some humans that will just do the utmost
[54:00] and that they'll do everything they can
[54:02] to cause trouble and chaos. Everybody
[54:04] don't do that that's not even saved. But
[54:07] there's some it's like they move into
[54:09] that degree where they can give their
[54:12] whole soul, their whole body, their
[54:15] whole being to God. They become obsessed
[54:19] with God, the righteous do. And then you
[54:22] look at the other side, Satan's got
[54:24] them. And they become so obsessed with
[54:27] Satan and they just they hate this move.
[54:30] They hate this agenda. They hate this
[54:32] preacher, this church, whatever it is.
[54:34] and they hate so oh my with such a
[54:37] degree they've got to kill somebody they
[54:40] got to take it out on somebody and where
[54:42] did Satan get that idea he watched the
[54:45] people of God how much they can love God
[54:47] so much and they would be willing to die
[54:51] you realize basically there's two
[54:52] degrees in Islam those that that really
[54:56] that really carry out what their leader
[54:59] did now I've got the the book of Quran
[55:01] and I've read a a great great portion of
[55:04] And those that are called today this
[55:07] extreme Islam and jihadists and all
[55:09] that, they are the ones that really
[55:12] personify their prophet because that's
[55:15] what their prophet was. He was a
[55:18] murderer. He was a rapist. He was a
[55:21] liar. You make him a saint if you want
[55:23] to. It proves you ain't never really
[55:25] read much about him. So those in this
[55:28] day that followed that faith so-called
[55:31] and the jihadists are actually acting
[55:35] like their messengers. But then there's
[55:38] others that embrace Islam and no, we're
[55:40] more peaceful and no, we love everybody
[55:43] and we just try to get along and and we
[55:46] really don't kill everybody and all
[55:48] that. They really don't believe what he
[55:50] did or what he said. Cuz all you got to
[55:54] do is read the Quran and you'll find out
[55:55] the way he feels and the way those who
[55:58] really follow him feels about us today
[56:00] because we're infidels. That's right.
[56:03] According to what he called us and
[56:05] according to their own Quran, they are
[56:07] are obligated to kill us. Well, you see,
[56:11] I find the same thing around the message
[56:13] of the hour. There are people who are so
[56:16] in love with the Lord Jesus and they
[56:18] love this message and the Lord Jesus so
[56:20] much. They're following the life and the
[56:23] example of the prophet of God that was
[56:25] sent to us. Why? Because he loved the
[56:28] Lord Jesus so much. He wanted to do
[56:30] whatever he called him to do. And then
[56:33] there's others that's around the message
[56:34] and they're not jihadists at all. You
[56:37] know, they just hang around the message
[56:38] and do what they want to. They pick and
[56:40] sort and get whatever they want. But you
[56:43] realize there's always been that element
[56:45] of people that have the ability to give
[56:47] to God everything that they are. I
[56:50] honestly feel sorry for those who cannot
[56:52] because there's really people on the
[56:54] earth today that they can't do it.
[56:55] They're just not ordained to and they
[56:57] never will. But for those who are called
[56:59] to love God into this degree, he wants
[57:03] them to become the epitome of what he
[57:06] is. And they won't just talk about it.
[57:09] They won't just do good deeds and say,
[57:11] "I love my neighbor. I love my
[57:13] neighbor." No, we're not talking about
[57:14] those that love you. We're talking about
[57:16] you're able to love the man that would
[57:18] walk up and and spit in your face
[57:23] &gt;&gt; and you not clench up your fist or rare
[57:25] back your hand and smack him in the
[57:27] mouth or wait till you get home or get
[57:30] out in the parking lot and pull out your
[57:32] phone and then start posting about it on
[57:34] Facebook.
[57:36] Facebook is everybody's pullpit, ain't
[57:38] it?
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I I find it amazing. Preachers
[57:41] even getting on there going back and
[57:43] forth and back and forth and church
[57:45] people hanging out their dirty laundry
[57:47] of what's going on in the church and
[57:48] family members hanging out their dirty
[57:51] laundry before the world to read. Have
[57:53] we lost our minds?
[57:56] &gt;&gt; I'm asking you a question. Have we lost
[57:58] our minds? The majority of the world
[58:00] has, friends.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Come on. But now notice he goes on to
[58:03] say, "If you can just love those who
[58:04] love you while sinners do the same
[58:06] thing." But we're different. When Christ
[58:08] comes into our heart, we love those who
[58:11] don't do not love us. Love the
[58:14] unlovable. Then we're unlovable one
[58:17] time, too. You know, and Christ loved us
[58:19] until we came to him. Then if we be of
[58:22] Christ and Christ is in us, we have the
[58:26] same spirit of fellowship and
[58:29] cooperation and helping to try to move
[58:32] the great load and make life a little
[58:36] easier for our fellow man. Now, how many
[58:39] people do you really know that live that
[58:42] kind of life? But there's some people
[58:45] that get joy out of causing people
[58:47] trouble. There's people that get joy out
[58:50] of causing godly men of God heartache
[58:53] and trouble. That's exactly right. They
[58:55] they do their family. There's children
[58:58] that absolutely love causing havoc in
[59:00] their home and dividing their home. I
[59:03] feel sorry for that type of people
[59:04] myself. Now notice first John 3:16, not
[59:08] John 3:16. As all of you know, John
[59:11] 3:16. For God so loved the world that he
[59:14] gave his only begotten son that
[59:15] whosoever believeth in him should not
[59:16] perish but have everlasting life. But
[59:19] here is first John 3:16. Hereby perceive
[59:23] we the love of God written by the same
[59:25] man now. But now the baptism of the Holy
[59:28] Ghost has come and the light, the focus
[59:30] is moved upon Jesus Christ in his human
[59:34] body, the bride. Hereby perceive we the
[59:37] love of God because he laid down his
[59:40] life for us and we now John 3:16 Jesus
[59:45] didn't say it this way. Why? It wasn't
[59:48] time yet. But now John could. Now think
[59:51] of it. There was things that the Lord
[59:53] Jesus did not say when he was on the
[59:56] earth in his earthly ministry because it
[59:59] was not time. There was people that the
[1:00:02] Lord Jesus did not heal because he left
[1:00:05] them for his boys to take care of. You
[1:00:09] see, he incorporated. He's the one who
[1:00:11] sent his men out to preach the gospel.
[1:00:15] He also sent them out to heal the sick.
[1:00:17] You ever wonder about the man that laid
[1:00:19] at the gate called beautiful? You
[1:00:21] realize the Lord Jesus walked by that
[1:00:23] man many, many times. The Lord Jesus
[1:00:26] walked right by him. The man did not lay
[1:00:29] there after Jesus had had raised from
[1:00:31] the dead or whenever he was here. But
[1:00:33] what was it? He was there for a long
[1:00:36] time. And yet the Lord Jesus walked
[1:00:39] right by him time after time and he
[1:00:41] thought, I'm going to let Peter have
[1:00:42] this one. I'm going to let John do that
[1:00:44] one. I'm going to let this one. Why? He
[1:00:47] wants the work to continue on in his
[1:00:50] body. Well, not just signs and wonders
[1:00:53] and speaking in tongues and dreams and
[1:00:54] visions. and we believe in all of that.
[1:00:57] But what is greater than even all of
[1:00:59] that, you know, and it it staggers
[1:01:01] people, but the prophet said it over and
[1:01:03] over again that I would rather have a
[1:01:05] church that was so full of the love of
[1:01:07] God even if they didn't have one
[1:01:10] spiritual gift among them. Now,
[1:01:12] remember, he's saying that in a
[1:01:13] Pentecostal era when they're emphasizing
[1:01:16] so much on the supernatural gifts. Why?
[1:01:19] Because he knew that love is eternal.
[1:01:22] You think we're going to speak in
[1:01:24] tongues in heaven? You think we're going
[1:01:26] to, you know, do like we do here and and
[1:01:28] prophesy and interpret and we're going
[1:01:31] to have prayer lines. There won't be
[1:01:32] nobody sick. There won't be nobody
[1:01:35] weary. There won't be nobody down. But
[1:01:37] love will be there and even in a greater
[1:01:40] measure than what it is now. Love is
[1:01:43] eternal. Speaking in tongues is not
[1:01:47] eternal. Prophecy is not eternal. Come
[1:01:50] on, somebody. What is eternal? love. For
[1:01:54] those who break into this, you are
[1:01:56] already receiving a deposit and a down
[1:01:59] payment of what it's going to be like
[1:02:02] when you move beyond the curtain of
[1:02:04] time. Now, notice John said, "Then we
[1:02:08] ought to lay down our lives for the
[1:02:10] brethren." I want you to notice now this
[1:02:12] may offend you a little bit, but when
[1:02:14] we're talking about the stature of a
[1:02:16] perfect man, and then the next one, of
[1:02:18] course, would go up to his brotherly
[1:02:20] kindness. And notice where we are. were
[1:02:22] in godliness to be like God. And then
[1:02:24] the seventh one will be brotherly
[1:02:26] kindness. And then the eighth will of
[1:02:29] course be the capstone charity, God
[1:02:30] himself, agape. But notice how that
[1:02:33] these three lice ones how they tie in.
[1:02:36] So to be godlike is to help you to love
[1:02:39] your brother. Now notice how that John
[1:02:42] says we ought to lay down our lives for
[1:02:45] the brethren. Well, why didn't he say
[1:02:46] sinners?
[1:02:49] Well, am I not supposed to die for the
[1:02:52] sinners? No, I'm not.
[1:02:54] One already done that.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; you and I don't have to lay down our
[1:02:58] life for sinners. But but notice this
[1:03:01] love is specific. Paul even called it
[1:03:05] being doing good, especially to the
[1:03:07] household of faith. Now, not that we
[1:03:10] should not do good to everybody, but
[1:03:12] there will be a degree of love that we
[1:03:14] will have for the brethren that we will
[1:03:17] not have for everyone else.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Now, come on. That is not ungodly. As a
[1:03:23] matter of fact, that is very godly.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; You see, this is why we can understand
[1:03:27] election and predestination and choosing
[1:03:30] in a way that other people just don't
[1:03:32] understand it. because it's a degree of
[1:03:35] love that he has for those of his own
[1:03:38] body. God so loved the world cosmos. God
[1:03:42] so loved the world. But how does he love
[1:03:45] the bride? God so loved the world he
[1:03:47] gave his only begotten son. That's
[1:03:49] right. God so loved the world that way.
[1:03:51] But he loved you if you're a bride. If
[1:03:53] you're elect, he loved you before John
[1:03:56] 3:16. As a matter of fact, he loved you
[1:03:58] before the foundation of the world.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Or can he do that,
[1:04:02] brother Donnie? I reckon he can. He's
[1:04:04] God. He can do what he wants to do. Now,
[1:04:06] notice then, so we ought to lay down our
[1:04:09] lives for the brethren. Now, let's look
[1:04:12] in St. John 4:7. I love the way John
[1:04:15] breaks into this. Remember, he was
[1:04:17] called the disciple of love. And I was
[1:04:19] reading about John uh just just day
[1:04:21] before yesterday. and how that when John
[1:04:23] got up into his 90s and he got to where
[1:04:26] he couldn't go to church and he had many
[1:04:28] afflictions in his body and things and
[1:04:30] they said that it was with great it was
[1:04:33] great difficulty for John to be able to
[1:04:35] get there. So the saints would come,
[1:04:37] some of the brothers would come to
[1:04:39] John's house and they would actually
[1:04:41] pick John up and put him on a primitive
[1:04:44] stretcher type thing and they would
[1:04:46] carry him and he would oh oh, you know,
[1:04:48] he was in pain and agony and stuff like
[1:04:50] that, but John still wanted to go to
[1:04:53] church. Now he got to a place he
[1:04:54] couldn't preach no more. So they'd just
[1:04:56] bring him to church and they'd kind of
[1:04:58] set him up front and the saints of God
[1:05:00] would come around, you know, want to
[1:05:02] shake his hand and things like that. And
[1:05:04] John would just say it every service.
[1:05:06] Every time he'd go to church, John would
[1:05:08] say it over and over again. Love one
[1:05:11] another, little children.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Love one another, little children. And
[1:05:15] he'd just say it over and over again.
[1:05:18] Now, isn't that amazing? This man stood
[1:05:20] at the foot of the cross. This man heard
[1:05:23] the last words from the human lips of
[1:05:25] the Lord Jesus. This man was one of the
[1:05:28] ones who was able to pick up the burial
[1:05:30] cross in his hands and step inside the
[1:05:33] tomb and realize Jesus had raised from
[1:05:35] the dead. This man stood right there in
[1:05:38] that room and watched Jesus walk through
[1:05:40] a wall. That same man turned and watched
[1:05:43] Jesus walk right out of that same wall.
[1:05:46] And this is to him the epitome of the
[1:05:49] message. Love one another, little
[1:05:51] children. Love one another, little
[1:05:54] children.
[1:05:56] Oh my. Now notice this writer John.
[1:06:00] Beloved, let us love one another. Now,
[1:06:03] oh, you think, well, I mean, everybody
[1:06:05] does that. No, they do not.
[1:06:08] As a matter of fact, this scripture is
[1:06:10] one of the very few in the Bible that
[1:06:12] only the tithing of the earth will ever
[1:06:16] be able to do.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Beloved or beloved, whichever you prefer
[1:06:20] to say it, let us love one another. Now,
[1:06:23] look at the word beloved. What it
[1:06:24] actually what it comes from comes from
[1:06:26] the Greek word agapeos and it means
[1:06:29] wellbeloved or dear
[1:06:32] esteemed
[1:06:34] favorite.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Look at these last three words. Worthy
[1:06:41] of love.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Worthy of love.
[1:06:47] Favorite.
[1:06:49] Now notice John is directing this. This
[1:06:52] is not now John 3:16 just to the world,
[1:06:55] but this is to the beloved. Those that
[1:06:58] are loved in the highest degree of God's
[1:07:02] love.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Beloved, let us love one another for
[1:07:07] love is of God and everyone that loveth
[1:07:12] is born of God. Now, wait a minute. So
[1:07:15] is John saying that any human that loves
[1:07:19] in any way, a dog, a cat, a horse, men
[1:07:23] love men and want to marry men and women
[1:07:25] love women and want to marry women. So
[1:07:27] does that mean the love that a woman
[1:07:28] feels toward another woman uh to be her
[1:07:31] wife, husband, however all that works. I
[1:07:33] I ain't never yet figured all that out.
[1:07:34] But however that is because she says she
[1:07:37] loves her, that means they're born of
[1:07:38] God.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; You see, this is very exclusive.
[1:07:44] those that really love the brethren, not
[1:07:46] those that say they do,
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; but those who really do. This is the one
[1:07:52] sign that you're actually born of God
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; because no one else in the earth can
[1:08:00] love to this degree.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; You can't do it with justification. You
[1:08:05] can't do it with sanctification. You got
[1:08:08] to have the true baptism of the Holy
[1:08:10] Ghost in your soul, which is the token.
[1:08:14] Now remember, love is dimensional and so
[1:08:18] is faith. So is virtue. So is knowledge.
[1:08:23] Now knowledge to the Greeks meant that
[1:08:26] you understood facts about certain
[1:08:29] things, whatever it is that you were
[1:08:31] talking about or studying at or looking
[1:08:33] at. So you understood certain facts and
[1:08:35] you embraced those. Yes, that's true.
[1:08:38] That That's right. That's right. But it
[1:08:40] may or may not affect your behavior. It
[1:08:44] may not alter you or make you any
[1:08:47] different. Oh, but the Jews, they
[1:08:49] believe something totally different.
[1:08:51] We'll get to in a minute. Now, watch.
[1:08:52] Beloved, let us love one another for
[1:08:55] love is of God and everyone that love
[1:08:58] us. Now, this is not filelio, but agape.
[1:09:03] And there's only one source of agape
[1:09:05] love and that is the Lord Jesus himself.
[1:09:08] We're not born humanly to agape anyone.
[1:09:12] But we are born humanly with the ability
[1:09:16] to Philadelphia.
[1:09:18] Philadelphia. Now you know why they call
[1:09:21] that city in Pennsylvania after that
[1:09:23] name. Anybody know what the name
[1:09:25] Philadelphia means? Brotherly love. So
[1:09:27] Philadelphia today is certainly a long
[1:09:30] ways from its name.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; That's right. But this is what it means.
[1:09:34] So it's it's a city of brotherly love
[1:09:36] supposedly. So Philadelphia love is a
[1:09:40] love among the brethren, but it's still
[1:09:43] not exactly the agape love. Now we were
[1:09:47] born to love our mother, love our
[1:09:49] father, love our siblings, love, love,
[1:09:52] love. So when we were real little, we
[1:09:54] started loving things and it probably
[1:09:55] took us a while to emotionally become
[1:09:58] identified as far as what love was. And
[1:10:01] then you started you met a young girl or
[1:10:03] a young boy and you started feeling a
[1:10:06] funny feeling like on the inside of you
[1:10:08] and an attachment toward that individual
[1:10:11] and then you did what we call you fell
[1:10:13] in love with that individual and you
[1:10:15] wanted to marry them and that's still
[1:10:17] not the kind of love we're talking
[1:10:19] about. So then maybe you heard a
[1:10:21] preacher and thought, "Oh, I love to
[1:10:23] hear that guy preach. He speaks so
[1:10:25] good." And you found a church somewhere.
[1:10:28] I love going to church there. I love the
[1:10:31] singing. I love this. I love that. And
[1:10:33] you love it. It still don't mean you
[1:10:34] love God yet.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Anya, I love the people of the church.
[1:10:38] And you may be experiencing
[1:10:40] Philadelphia.
[1:10:42] I love the people of the church. They're
[1:10:44] just so nice. I love hanging around
[1:10:45] them. You know, you realize that that
[1:10:47] there's an element of people in the
[1:10:49] world. And whenever they get together
[1:10:50] and party every night, or how many ever
[1:10:52] nights that they do it, they have a love
[1:10:54] for the people they party with. Well,
[1:10:57] not always, but sometimes. and and they
[1:10:59] have a love for the people they get
[1:11:01] drunk with. What is that? It's a human
[1:11:03] love that we have the ability to contact
[1:11:06] each other. That has nothing to do with
[1:11:08] this.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; There were people that was around God's
[1:11:11] prophet and no doubt they said they
[1:11:13] loved him, but it's evident they didn't
[1:11:16] believe what he said, which means they
[1:11:17] didn't have divine love or they would
[1:11:19] have done what he told them to do.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Now watch. So love is in degrees. Faith
[1:11:26] is in degrees. Jesus himself said, "Oh
[1:11:29] ye of little faith and then he would
[1:11:31] tell people great is your faith." So
[1:11:33] that shows us faith has measurements or
[1:11:36] dimensional value to it. And love is the
[1:11:39] same way. Now what's John is writing
[1:11:41] about the preeminent or the capstone
[1:11:45] measure of love. Everyone that loveth is
[1:11:48] born of God and knoweth God. Now let me
[1:11:54] share this with you. To the Jew, true
[1:11:56] knowledge always manifested itself in
[1:11:59] one's conduct.
[1:12:01] One did not know something until that
[1:12:05] fact had a practical outworking
[1:12:10] in his life. Now, it's evident, friends,
[1:12:12] there's a lot of folks in our message
[1:12:14] are Greeks cuz the Greeks meant to know
[1:12:17] the facts. But these facts may or may
[1:12:19] not affect one cond. Oh, the prophet
[1:12:22] said this and the prophet said that and
[1:12:23] the prophet said something else. They're
[1:12:25] practicing the Greek theology of the
[1:12:28] message. So, they know it, but it's
[1:12:30] apparent it hasn't affected their life.
[1:12:32] But to the Jew, true knowledge always
[1:12:35] manifested itself in one's conduct. And
[1:12:39] the church said, "One did not know
[1:12:42] something until that fact had a
[1:12:45] practical outworking in his life." Don't
[1:12:47] you understand? That's what we're
[1:12:49] hunging for. We've got the knowledge of
[1:12:51] the virtues. We've got the knowledge I
[1:12:54] need to love more. I need to be better
[1:12:56] this. That's knowledge of knowing that
[1:12:58] it's true. And knowledge of knowing
[1:13:01] yourself and saying, "Yes, I'm lacking
[1:13:03] there. I I I have it, but I don't have
[1:13:05] the degree that I want." That's
[1:13:07] knowledge. But what do you want it to
[1:13:10] become? Supreme knowledge. Remember,
[1:13:12] this is one of the virtues. Knowledge.
[1:13:15] Now notice in everyone that loveth or
[1:13:18] agape is born of God and knoweth God. So
[1:13:23] look is born. What what is what is born?
[1:13:26] It's to love the brethren is the
[1:13:28] evidence of regeneration. You said
[1:13:30] that's too simple. No, it's not. It is
[1:13:33] so profound in its simplicity is where
[1:13:37] people step right over because well I
[1:13:39] love the brothers. I love the brothers,
[1:13:40] but yet, Brother Donnie, I do this and I
[1:13:42] do that, and I have problems with this
[1:13:44] and that, and there's certain ones I
[1:13:45] don't like. Ah, here we go. But you see,
[1:13:48] when you really love like God loves, God
[1:13:51] has the ability of being able to love us
[1:13:55] in spite of our faults and our failures.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Now, this is where it's really hard for
[1:14:00] us as humans. Oh, I love Brother Donnie,
[1:14:03] but boy, he's got faults. He sure does.
[1:14:07] Oh, I love Brother Dave, but now he's
[1:14:09] got faults. I'll tell you one thing,
[1:14:11] Brother Larry's a good piano player.
[1:14:13] He's got his thoughts. Brother Harry, I
[1:14:15] get so blessed. Brother Louie, ain't he
[1:14:17] just an awesome song leader? But I'll
[1:14:19] tell you, he's flawed now. And I I I
[1:14:22] have a hard time really loving him to
[1:14:24] that degree. You know why? Cuz you're
[1:14:25] looking at that instead of the agape
[1:14:28] from your heart.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. So to love the brethren,
[1:14:32] it was this simple. Now remember all
[1:14:34] that John saw and all that he could have
[1:14:37] said. To believe in the cross. To
[1:14:40] believe in the cross means you're born
[1:14:42] of God. To believe that Jesus raised
[1:14:44] from the dead means that you're born of
[1:14:46] God. To believe that that Jesus has
[1:14:49] ascended back up into heaven. But you
[1:14:51] mean to tell me the man that saw all of
[1:14:53] that used none of that as an evidence
[1:14:56] that you were born of God?
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:01] But what was this evidence? You love the
[1:15:05] brethren.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Well, I'll tell you one thing. It looks
[1:15:11] like to me that this is going to be a
[1:15:13] divided line the closer we get to the
[1:15:16] top.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; It's no wonder to me then that Satan
[1:15:19] tries his best to move among us and our
[1:15:22] ranks and divide us and separate us
[1:15:25] because each of us are a dynamo.
[1:15:28] And from that dynamo, we create by the
[1:15:32] things we feed on and the nature. So
[1:15:34] it's like a whirl going around inside of
[1:15:36] us. And we're creating this all the
[1:15:39] time. So people get around us and
[1:15:41] according to whether we like them or
[1:15:43] dislike them that it will mess up with
[1:15:45] our spiritual gyro and we're spinning
[1:15:48] around. Boy, when things are going good,
[1:15:50] I mean, we're just spinning, spinning,
[1:15:52] spinning, spinning. And then if we get
[1:15:53] around people that we don't jive with as
[1:15:56] we say and we don't really like their
[1:15:57] atmosphere then they will slow down our
[1:16:00] spiritual gyro and then we have a
[1:16:02] different look on our face and we act a
[1:16:04] little bit different. Now you saints
[1:16:06] y'all can go ahead and say amen to this
[1:16:08] now.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; But you see that's when it really proves
[1:16:12] our love. But can we love that brother
[1:16:15] or that sister beyond their faults and
[1:16:18] their failures? Now, there's people that
[1:16:20] you just don't enjoy being around,
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me, Brother Keith, he's the
[1:16:25] only one that's honest in this church. I
[1:16:28] said there's people that you just don't
[1:16:29] enjoy being around as human. Now, that
[1:16:32] don't mean that you hate them. That
[1:16:35] means that you don't enjoy the
[1:16:37] atmosphere that they create or the
[1:16:39] things they talk about. Every time you
[1:16:41] get around them, they're always talking
[1:16:43] about their self. I want this and I'm
[1:16:45] going there and I'm doing this and I'm
[1:16:47] this and I'm that and I went to shopping
[1:16:49] and I bought this and I and I I mean you
[1:16:51] can stand there and just be with them
[1:16:52] all day long and that's all they talk
[1:16:54] about or they're talking about their
[1:16:56] pain, their sorrow, their big toe, their
[1:16:58] lumbago, their their blood pressure
[1:16:59] medicine. They're talking about
[1:17:00] everything is just about them and you
[1:17:03] realize they don't really want to know
[1:17:05] about your problems. They just want you
[1:17:07] to listen to theirs.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm sorry friends. I can only
[1:17:12] handle so much of that stuff. I've got
[1:17:14] too much happy things to talk about to
[1:17:17] be involved in an 8-hour pity party with
[1:17:19] somebody that's looking for somebody to
[1:17:21] feel sorry for. Come on, church.
[1:17:25] Now, do I dislike them? Do I hate them?
[1:17:27] Absolutely not. Why? Because God wants
[1:17:30] us to love one another and in reality
[1:17:33] put up with each other until we're all
[1:17:36] changed. You see, I'm glad we're not
[1:17:39] just going back to being young people.
[1:17:42] Wouldn't heaven be a mess? in about 24
[1:17:44] hours. If we were all just reverted back
[1:17:47] to 18 years old and we had the same
[1:17:49] temperament, the same makeup, the same
[1:17:52] humanity that we do now, can you imagine
[1:17:54] what heaven would be? It'd be about like
[1:17:56] another Johnson City in two days.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; But you know what will be changed? not
[1:18:01] only our mortality but the temperament
[1:18:04] and the makeup about each one of us that
[1:18:07] clashes with the people that we go to
[1:18:09] church with or people in the economy of
[1:18:12] God. You see those that have moved
[1:18:14] beyond the curtain of time when the
[1:18:16] prophet ventured there in that
[1:18:18] translation he mentions nothing about
[1:18:20] tears nothing about sadness nothing
[1:18:23] about sorrow nothing about
[1:18:25] disappointment nothing about people
[1:18:28] often little clicks and clans nope that
[1:18:30] certainly wasn't ours was it cuz people
[1:18:32] are so clickish and clanish but they
[1:18:35] were all just together and he noticed
[1:18:37] them just moving together and they was
[1:18:39] hanging out together wow that sounds
[1:18:41] like heaven to And nobody was you know
[1:18:44] nobody was down nobody was weary saw no
[1:18:47] sadness no no no no frowns upon people's
[1:18:50] face so what was it they had moved
[1:18:52] beyond their humanity but remember the
[1:18:55] sixth dimension is only a temporary
[1:18:58] place it is not your end those people
[1:19:01] when he saw them there he asked them do
[1:19:03] you eat here no we don't eat here but
[1:19:06] someday we go back to earth and take up
[1:19:09] bodies now I mentioned you Wednesday
[1:19:10] night I'm going to mention it Again, the
[1:19:12] prophet tells us when a man meets a
[1:19:14] woman and he falls in love with her and
[1:19:15] he don't know why. And a woman meets a
[1:19:17] man and she falls in love with him and
[1:19:19] she don't know why. That they are an
[1:19:21] eternal mate. They stepped out of
[1:19:24] eternity together and they'll step back
[1:19:26] into eternity again. Now notice in the
[1:19:28] sixth dimension when sister me come up
[1:19:31] to brother Brandham or his wife come up,
[1:19:34] she did not treat him any different than
[1:19:37] the rest of those. My precious brother,
[1:19:39] my precious brother. Why? The sixth
[1:19:42] dimension is a place which they go to
[1:19:44] and they are held waiting for us. But
[1:19:47] remember when we go back to earth and
[1:19:50] take up bodies, that eternal mate will
[1:19:54] be identified with you in the eternal
[1:19:57] mate form. How could it not be that? If
[1:20:00] it's an eternal mate that stepped out of
[1:20:03] eternity together and come back down
[1:20:05] here, there won't be children of course
[1:20:07] or nothing like that. But she will be
[1:20:10] there with you, brothers, through
[1:20:12] eternity.
[1:20:13] Well, somebody ought to be saying,
[1:20:14] "Praise the Lord for that." It will
[1:20:17] always be that something. The sixth
[1:20:19] dimension was like a gathering of the
[1:20:22] family. But remember, for some of them
[1:20:24] there, their maid had not made it yet.
[1:20:27] They had not arrived beyond the curtain
[1:20:29] of time. So, it's not going to quite be
[1:20:32] the exact same way. It's a holding
[1:20:35] place. But what was it that was so
[1:20:37] noticeable? It was the love of God that
[1:20:40] he experienced.
[1:20:42] Oh my. Unlike any love he had ever known
[1:20:46] before. Now notice John goes on to say
[1:20:49] in verse 8, he that loveth not knoweth
[1:20:53] not God for God is love. Now notice God
[1:20:58] is love. So this does not refer to
[1:21:02] something necessarily that he does but
[1:21:05] who he is. Not not what he does, but who
[1:21:10] he is. You see, who he is is what
[1:21:13] manifests what he does. But if we're not
[1:21:16] careful, we'll substitute that and say,
[1:21:17] "Well, I love people because I do this."
[1:21:22] That's contrary to scripture.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; You are born of God when you love and
[1:21:28] this is the evidence and those works
[1:21:31] will follow your life. Oh, people say,
[1:21:33] "Well, I love God. I just don't like
[1:21:35] people." No, you don't love God, right?
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; You cannot love God and not love his
[1:21:41] children.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; you cannot love God and not love his
[1:21:47] children. And you can't love God, right,
[1:21:49] if you don't want to gather together
[1:21:50] with his children either.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; So God is love isn't referring just to
[1:21:56] so much what he does, but it is who he
[1:21:59] is. It's far more than just an attribute
[1:22:03] or a characteristic. You see, it's it's
[1:22:06] the traits, the identification. It
[1:22:09] underscores everything that he is. It's
[1:22:12] his very essence, benevolence, which is
[1:22:16] one of the meanings of love. So, it's of
[1:22:18] God's nature. So, this statement
[1:22:21] actually encap encapsulates the truth
[1:22:24] and compasses all the volume of
[1:22:28] everything that God is. God is love.
[1:22:31] Now, what a thing for John to say. Now,
[1:22:34] wouldn't that be something if in reality
[1:22:37] it could be said about us? Now, think
[1:22:39] about this. God's love is not mere
[1:22:43] feeling, but it is action. So, it's not
[1:22:47] just feeling. Well, love is a feeling.
[1:22:49] No, love is more than a feeling. Oh, we
[1:22:52] we say it all the time, of course, but
[1:22:54] we come back to John 3:16. So, it
[1:22:56] teaches us that God so loved the world
[1:22:58] that he gave. So, God so loved the world
[1:23:01] that he gave. So what did that love
[1:23:04] require? It required the expression of
[1:23:07] doing or action. Oh Jesus, I love you
[1:23:10] with all of my heart. Well, how come you
[1:23:12] don't pray? Oh Jesus, I love you with
[1:23:14] all of my heart, but I don't pay my
[1:23:16] tithe, Lord. I love you with all of my
[1:23:18] heart, but I don't go to church. I only
[1:23:20] go to church, you know, once and once a
[1:23:21] year maybe or twice, something like
[1:23:22] that. I love you, Lord, but I love you
[1:23:24] with all my heart. No, there's something
[1:23:26] wrong with what you're saying versus
[1:23:28] what you're doing.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Notice in verse 9, in this was
[1:23:34] manifested the love of God toward us
[1:23:37] because that God sent in this was
[1:23:40] manifested the love of God. So this
[1:23:43] action was not the love of God. It was
[1:23:46] the manifestation of the love of God.
[1:23:49] You understand? So people can get an
[1:23:52] action and they can do an action. Well,
[1:23:54] I'm going to do this. I'm going to help
[1:23:56] a missionary. I'm going to help that and
[1:23:59] help that. and still not love God the
[1:24:01] way they should love him. But if they do
[1:24:04] get that love, then what they do is
[1:24:08] actually working from the source that's
[1:24:11] in the soul, then it's not legalism. Oh,
[1:24:13] I got to go to church today. Oh, man. I
[1:24:16] wanted to stay home and watch somebody's
[1:24:18] playing somebody on football or, you
[1:24:20] know, they're doing this. Oh, I hope
[1:24:22] Brother Donnie ain't long today. Don't
[1:24:23] worry, I'll have you out here by at
[1:24:25] least 6:00 p.m. Try my best anyhow. Oh,
[1:24:28] I I I I you know, I I want to do this
[1:24:30] and I want to do that, but if I don't go
[1:24:32] to church, the deacons will be calling
[1:24:33] me on the phone. There's something wrong
[1:24:35] with your love life.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; I said, there's something wrong with
[1:24:38] your love life.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Going to church is just an outworking of
[1:24:42] the love of God in your heart, not only
[1:24:44] for God. Oh, Brother Donnie, I come to
[1:24:46] church only for God. You're wrong.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; You're sinning.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; I'll let you think on that.
[1:24:58] Now notice because that God sent his
[1:25:00] only begotten son into the world that we
[1:25:02] might live through him. Herein is love,
[1:25:06] not that we loved God, but that he loved
[1:25:10] us.
[1:25:12] Now watch how this is.
[1:25:15] Herein is love. Not that we love God,
[1:25:17] but that he loved us. So it's not you're
[1:25:20] going to love because these people out
[1:25:22] here love you. You're not godly yet.
[1:25:26] You're godly when you love them, even if
[1:25:29] they never love you.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Get this in your mind. Of all the
[1:25:36] billions of people on the face of the
[1:25:38] earth, Almighty God loves
[1:25:42] every one of them.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Every liar, every thief, every
[1:25:49] transgender.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:54] Wow.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; A soul, a mortal whom Christ died for.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Now, will they accept it? The majority
[1:26:02] will not. But that does not stop him
[1:26:05] from loving them.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; But for us, it's conditional. Well, I
[1:26:09] love him as long as he's good to me. You
[1:26:11] scratch my back and I'll scratch yours.
[1:26:13] We're not scratching backs. We're
[1:26:14] talking about being born again.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Well, they quit
[1:26:18] loving me. I'm quitting loving them. No,
[1:26:20] no, no, no, no. You see the real love of
[1:26:23] God can never stop loving. You
[1:26:25] understand that he purchased all of
[1:26:27] humanity. They belong to him by price of
[1:26:31] purchase. They belong to him. Then it
[1:26:34] will be up to them whether or not they
[1:26:36] accept what he did. Notice John said,
[1:26:40] "Oh my God, open our hearts, Father.
[1:26:42] Here in love, not that we love God, but
[1:26:44] that he loved us and sent his son to be
[1:26:47] the perpetuation for our sin. be loved.
[1:26:49] If God so love us,
[1:26:54] we also ought also to love one another.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; So you mean it's a sign of how much I
[1:27:04] love God
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; the way I treat you?
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; So if I treat you mean,
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; that means I'm treating Jesus mean.
[1:27:18] Praise the Lord.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Godliness.
[1:27:23] Our love for God is proven by our love
[1:27:29] for one another.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Now, from this point on, amens aren't
[1:27:35] really essential or necessary. I can
[1:27:37] preach with them or without them, but
[1:27:39] it'll probably be a good sign for you
[1:27:40] all up in heaven that you're amening the
[1:27:42] truth, even if you have to use a couple
[1:27:44] of ouches
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; every now and then.
[1:27:47] Now notice verse 12. 1 John 4:12. No man
[1:27:51] has seen God at any time.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; If we love one another,
[1:27:58] God dwelleth in us. What in the world is
[1:28:01] seeing God
[1:28:04] got to do with my love for you?
[1:28:09] So none of us have seen God at any time.
[1:28:14] John, why would you link these two
[1:28:16] together? Because they go together.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; No man has seen God in any time if we
[1:28:25] agape.
[1:28:28] Not Felio
[1:28:30] or Philadelphia.
[1:28:34] If we agape, there's only one source.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that does not come like the
[1:28:41] anointing of the Holy Ghost comes on you
[1:28:43] and then God gives you perfect love and
[1:28:46] then it leaves you. No, it comes from
[1:28:48] your own dose of agape in your soul.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Then you are not receiving that love
[1:28:56] like the anointing and it leaves you and
[1:28:58] then it comes back and it leaves you. It
[1:29:00] is yours forever and you are becoming
[1:29:04] love
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; itself.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Why? You're reborn.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Reborn of who? Love.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; For God is love. No man has seen God in
[1:29:17] any time. If we love, look at this word
[1:29:20] now, agape, which is charity, affection,
[1:29:23] goodwill, love, benevolence, or love
[1:29:27] feasts. Love feasts. If we love one
[1:29:32] another, God dwelleth. Isn't that a
[1:29:36] pretty broad spectrum in saying that?
[1:29:39] That if you love one another, in
[1:29:41] reality, it's not. It's very narrow.
[1:29:44] There's only one way we can agape one
[1:29:48] another. God lives in us.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Don't you understand, friends? It's
[1:29:54] impossible for us to agape one another
[1:29:58] before we're born again.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; It cannot be.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; It cannot be. You understand those of
[1:30:06] you that are born again of the spirit of
[1:30:07] God and you have the Holy Ghost and
[1:30:09] you're married that you will have human
[1:30:12] love towards your husband, your wife.
[1:30:13] That's wonderful. It's awesome. You
[1:30:15] ought to have that. But if you're truly
[1:30:17] born again, both of you, you also have
[1:30:19] another sphere, another channel by which
[1:30:22] you love one another. That's the eternal
[1:30:24] mate part. That's why there's something
[1:30:27] in you. Even when they're gone to the
[1:30:29] sixth dimension, you long you long to be
[1:30:32] with them again. You will be. You will
[1:30:36] be because it was eternal together and
[1:30:39] it's eternity you shall be. No man, oh
[1:30:43] my has seen God at any time. If we love
[1:30:46] one another, God dwell us. Lord,
[1:30:50] children,
[1:30:52] God
[1:30:53] dwell us
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; in us.
[1:30:59] So he don't come in and move out and
[1:31:01] come in and move out and come in and
[1:31:03] move out and he he he moves in when
[1:31:05] you're doing great. He moves in when
[1:31:06] you're man, you're praying, you're
[1:31:08] reading your Bible. Believe it or not,
[1:31:09] God still dwells in you when you're
[1:31:11] getting lazy.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Oh, he'll whoop the farhead
[1:31:16] of you, too. He'll give you a good
[1:31:17] gospel spanking and get your hide
[1:31:19] straightened out. But you know what?
[1:31:21] Once he takes up his residence in your
[1:31:23] soul, he is a permanent resident. He
[1:31:26] ain't never leaving you again. Thank God
[1:31:28] for that. Praise the Lord.
[1:31:32] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:31:34] No man hath seen God at any time. If we
[1:31:37] love one another, God dwelleth in us,
[1:31:39] and his love is perfected
[1:31:43] not in himself,
[1:31:47] but in us.
[1:31:51] The word perfect and perfected is
[1:31:54] several different meanings of it in the
[1:31:55] New Testament. And this is to Leo which
[1:31:58] means make perfect finish fulfill
[1:32:00] complete to carry through completely to
[1:32:04] accomplish finish bring to an end.
[1:32:11] The same word where Paul used it in
[1:32:13] Ephesians 4:11
[1:32:16] about the five-fold ministry, the
[1:32:18] perfecting
[1:32:20] of the saints.
[1:32:22] God loves the ministry. So, I wonder
[1:32:26] what it is on message people and some of
[1:32:28] them anyway that hate it.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; It's not the love of God.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Now, let's look in in verse 16.
[1:32:37] And we have known and believe the love
[1:32:40] that God hath unto us. God is love
[1:32:46] and he that dwelt us in love
[1:32:52] dwelt in God. Now before John said that
[1:32:56] if we love God dwells in us
[1:32:59] but now God wants you to move in
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; with him.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Now God don't have a live-in lover.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; God don't shack up.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; So if God wants you to move in with him,
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; it must mean you and God got married.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:23] Praise the Lord. God don't believe in
[1:33:25] fornication.
[1:33:27] Come on, somebody.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; John, are you kidding us?
[1:33:32] John, could you mean this the way that
[1:33:34] it sounds? If we have known and believe
[1:33:37] the love that God hath to us, God is
[1:33:39] love, and he that dwelleth in love
[1:33:44] dwelleth
[1:33:46] in God. Oh, children, can't you see
[1:33:48] where God wants us to live?
[1:33:51] to where love is not something that
[1:33:53] comes and goes and comes and goes and
[1:33:56] and you you you feel it twice a week on
[1:33:58] church days and oh every now and then
[1:34:00] you feel it God wants it to be your
[1:34:03] residence
[1:34:04] that you live in the realm of love and
[1:34:08] when you do in agape now remember this
[1:34:11] is not Philadelphia this is not filio
[1:34:15] this is for those who live in the realm
[1:34:18] of agape they dwell dwell in agape. It
[1:34:23] is their residence.
[1:34:25] And when they live in agape,
[1:34:29] they dwell in God.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Listen to this one. Is not this the very
[1:34:35] thing the Lord Jesus said in that day I
[1:34:38] and my father and you in me. I in you
[1:34:42] and you in me.
[1:34:44] This is the very church the Lord Jesus
[1:34:47] is coming for as his own.
[1:34:52] He that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God
[1:34:57] and God in him.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; How many can say that with all of your
[1:35:04] heart today?
[1:35:06] I dwell in God
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; and God dwells
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; in me.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Watch this. And thinking man's filter.
[1:35:19] Can you also love the unlovable?
[1:35:23] That's the thinking man's filter.
[1:35:27] That's the spirit of Christ in you.
[1:35:30] Loving those who don't love you. Then
[1:35:32] you have the reward of God. Now, we're
[1:35:35] talking about being godly. But now, if
[1:35:37] you do it as a duty, you still haven't
[1:35:41] got the thinking man. You're only up in
[1:35:44] the second cycle. But if it's from your
[1:35:47] heart, you really love him, then you're
[1:35:49] breathing through the sinking man's
[1:35:52] filter. Praise God. And it satisfies a
[1:35:56] holy man's taste that you know from your
[1:36:00] heart. You forgive your closest friends.
[1:36:04] Maybe
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; you forgive
[1:36:08] everybody,
[1:36:10] everything.
[1:36:12] No matter what taken place.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; And then what a way to cap this off.
[1:36:17] Isn't he wonderful?
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; You forgive everybody
[1:36:23] everything and describes about what
[1:36:25] you're going to do and then said, "Isn't
[1:36:27] he wonderful? Well, he's the only reason
[1:36:29] I could ever do that. He's the only
[1:36:31] reason you could ever do it. It's not in
[1:36:33] us to forgive everybody and forgive them
[1:36:36] of everything they've ever done against
[1:36:38] you. Oh, praise God. Notice Jesus never
[1:36:42] lived for himself. His life was spent
[1:36:45] for others. That's perfectly
[1:36:49] eternal life.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; When you say you go to church and you do
[1:36:55] good things, that's fine. But when you
[1:36:57] live your life to yourself,
[1:37:01] you haven't eternal life.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Eternal life is living
[1:37:09] for others.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Eternal life is living
[1:37:18] for others.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; He proved it when he come in the lamb of
[1:37:22] God. He lived and had eternal life
[1:37:24] because he did not live for himself. He
[1:37:27] lived for others. And you receive
[1:37:30] eternal life by receiving that day. What
[1:37:34] day? Title of his sermon. That day on
[1:37:39] Calvary.
[1:37:42] And you don't live for yourself no more.
[1:37:45] You live for others. And Word of Life
[1:37:48] Church said,
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we say, "Help us, Lord."
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, now there's some people we can live
[1:37:56] for. Oh my goodness. We have no problem.
[1:37:59] We'd buy them lunch or we'd help pay
[1:38:02] their insurance or we'd do my we'd do
[1:38:05] whatever. But boy, there's certain ones
[1:38:07] we have a problem with, which is the
[1:38:09] person you should buy their lunch for.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Notice he said someone said, "How can
[1:38:15] you stand and let anyone call you such
[1:38:18] bad names? You don't live for yourself.
[1:38:21] You live for others that you might
[1:38:23] redeem
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; that man.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; You become sons. And the trouble of it
[1:38:31] is that's what the church has forgot
[1:38:32] that we're sons. You're our sons. You're
[1:38:34] taking Christ's place.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; You're sons. So you don't live for
[1:38:39] yourself. You live for others. Well,
[1:38:41] brother Brandham, I can live for this
[1:38:43] brother because he's a nice man. That's
[1:38:44] not it. Live for that man who hates you.
[1:38:49] live for that person who'd kill you.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; You see, friends, the more I study this
[1:38:58] message, the more I realize a lot of
[1:39:01] these folks is pulling away from the
[1:39:03] message. Right? Here's some of the main
[1:39:04] reason for a lot of them why they are.
[1:39:06] They can't live this message. Cuz it
[1:39:08] brings it down so clear. It brings it
[1:39:11] down so plain right down where you live.
[1:39:15] Oh, I love it. Don't you? I thank God
[1:39:17] for it. Love that man that hates you.
[1:39:20] Live for that person that would kill you
[1:39:24] if they could.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; So what if a person would kill you? And
[1:39:29] they've actually told you if I could get
[1:39:31] by with it, I would run over you.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; I would run you off the road. I would
[1:39:37] slip you strick nine in your Kool-Aid. I
[1:39:40] would give you rat poison and your
[1:39:42] morning coffee. I do it cuz I hate you
[1:39:45] so bad. I absolutely despise you.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; And then you say, Lord, what can I do to
[1:39:52] help that poor man?
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; What could I help, Lord, to help that
[1:39:56] poor woman? Lord, what have I done that
[1:39:58] that please forgive me if I've done
[1:40:00] something that would cause him or her to
[1:40:02] feel that way? Lord, what could I do
[1:40:03] that I I might be able to redeem
[1:40:08] that individual? Amen.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; You
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; you
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; you see when perfect love becomes
[1:40:16] pulsating out of our soul, we become the
[1:40:19] very tools that God will use for
[1:40:22] redemption.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Not our blood, not our life, his love in
[1:40:27] us. What is it that gets a hold of a
[1:40:29] sinner's heart when they hear they're
[1:40:31] lost and they're wretched? It's hearing
[1:40:33] about the love of God. What if we can
[1:40:36] bring it on down into bride form and let
[1:40:38] the world know and let the people know
[1:40:41] Jesus Christ is not dead? He's not a
[1:40:43] figure of some picture hanging on a wall
[1:40:46] somewhere. He is alive and well and
[1:40:49] living in his multimembered body around
[1:40:52] the world.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, give us a church like
[1:40:57] that here.
[1:41:02] Oh, God.
[1:41:05] My my
[1:41:07] live for that person. He'd kill you if
[1:41:09] they could. That's what they done to
[1:41:12] him. They killed him. That's eternal
[1:41:15] life. When that's in your bosom,
[1:41:20] you're facing
[1:41:23] you're facing
[1:41:25] heaven. Then,
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; what are we doing until it's there? We
[1:41:30] got our back to heaven. We got our side
[1:41:33] to heaven. We got our other side to
[1:41:35] heaven. But when we can do this, we can
[1:41:38] look heaven straight in the face
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; and say, "I'm ready now."
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Sacrifice your own things. Give them up
[1:41:50] like sheep gives its wool.
[1:41:53] You look on towards
[1:41:56] Calvary.
[1:41:58] godly. How many in the church this
[1:42:01] morning wants to be like God? Now
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; few of you. Few of you.
[1:42:07] I'm gonna keep on preaching till you do.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:42:11] I believe with all of my heart, friends,
[1:42:14] these are not just good scriptures.
[1:42:17] They're not just nice quotes. Oh, that
[1:42:19] that's really nice. I I really
[1:42:21] appreciate that. I really like that. I'm
[1:42:22] going to go in the library and see if
[1:42:23] brother Jackie will print it out for me
[1:42:25] so I can just kind of refer back to it.
[1:42:27] You don't just need it on a piece of
[1:42:28] paper. You need it to where it'll become
[1:42:30] a part of your being.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; And it becomes so much a part of you
[1:42:34] that you are becoming these tapes you're
[1:42:37] hearing. You're becoming the word that
[1:42:39] you're hearing. God, help me to love the
[1:42:41] way you love. Help me to forgive the way
[1:42:44] you forgive. Help me, Lord, to reach
[1:42:46] beyond myself.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[1:42:52] Oh. Help us, Lord. Let's jump down to
[1:42:55] this next quarter. We'll close your just
[1:42:57] in a bit. Putting on the whole armor of
[1:42:58] God. You see the Holy Spirit. Watch him
[1:43:01] here. Look at Elijah in his cave. How
[1:43:03] would we see him in the doors today with
[1:43:05] beards all out in his face and his bald
[1:43:07] head shining piece of sheep skin drapped
[1:43:09] around him. We'd probably run out in the
[1:43:11] yard. Some of our intellectual brethren.
[1:43:13] That's right. But you don't know what's
[1:43:14] beaten beneath that little skin there.
[1:43:17] The Holy Spirit may be tabernacle there.
[1:43:20] You must never do that. We must be
[1:43:22] brothers. Treat a man, no matter if he's
[1:43:25] in the wrong,
[1:43:27] still treat him
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; nice.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Be nice to him. If you haven't got that
[1:43:33] spirit, there's something wrong.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus was nice to those who were ugly to
[1:43:40] him. You must be Christians full of
[1:43:43] love, ready to help any race, color,
[1:43:48] creed, anytime, anywhere, anytime. We
[1:43:52] must be that way. That's Christians.
[1:43:55] Hallelujah. That's the way Christ would
[1:43:58] have us. And to be Christian is to be
[1:44:02] Christlike.
[1:44:03] What is it? Godly.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Godly.
[1:44:08] But you know the sad part about it is he
[1:44:11] was dealing with it in his day of
[1:44:12] course. And if there's anything that's a
[1:44:14] hindrance to Christianity today, it's
[1:44:16] the way that professed Christians live.
[1:44:19] dishonest,
[1:44:21] dishonorable, and living any way. Don't
[1:44:24] do that. We're Christians. Somebody's
[1:44:26] watching your life correctly. Be honest.
[1:44:29] Let everybody know. Let your dealings be
[1:44:32] fair and square. Don't take nothing that
[1:44:35] doesn't belong to you. Don't say
[1:44:37] nothing, but what's the truth? I wish
[1:44:39] somebody would say, "Amen."
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Amen. You can always tell the
[1:44:46] truth every time, and God will honor the
[1:44:48] truth. He always does. Treat everybody
[1:44:51] right. If they don't treat you right,
[1:44:54] you treat them right anyhow. See, Jesus
[1:44:58] treated us right when we didn't treat
[1:45:01] him
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; And what will we find ourselves moving
[1:45:07] into deeper degrees
[1:45:10] of love
[1:45:12] until you finally arrive at the
[1:45:16] threshold?
[1:45:19] And let me close with this.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; There isn't nothing else that you can
[1:45:24] do. Only believe. And if you believe,
[1:45:27] them little moral things will just drop
[1:45:29] out off like that. And as you believe,
[1:45:33] you become
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; love.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; And love is God. And you begin to wind
[1:45:44] yourself.
[1:45:45] Isn't it amazing that our actions are so
[1:45:48] tied to his will and his word that we
[1:45:51] are actually winding ourself? So there's
[1:45:55] things we've got to do. So we will
[1:45:58] actually wind ourself
[1:46:02] wind ourself oh hallelujah into Christ.
[1:46:07] And these other things you don't have to
[1:46:09] quit doing them. They just quit
[1:46:11] themselves. There's no desire to do it.
[1:46:14] The worshipper wants purged.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; Godliness
[1:46:21] to be like
[1:46:23] God.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; To be like Jesus.
[1:46:30] To be like Jesus.
[1:46:36] On earth.
[1:46:38] I long
[1:46:41] to be like him
[1:46:45] all through
[1:46:47] life's journey
[1:46:51] from earth to gloryy.
[1:46:58] I only ask
[1:47:02] to be
[1:47:04] like
[1:47:06] him.
[1:47:08] Can we stand together and sing it to
[1:47:10] him?
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; I want to love like Jesus.
[1:47:20] I want to love
[1:47:23] like Jesus.
[1:47:28] On earth I long. Just hold the music,
[1:47:33] brothers. Let the brothers sing it. the
[1:47:35] sisters, all of us together to be like
[1:47:38] him
[1:47:41] all through
[1:47:44] life's journey
[1:47:49] from earth
[1:47:51] to gloryy.
[1:47:56] I only
[1:47:59] ask
[1:48:01] to be
[1:48:04] like,
[1:48:05] [Music]
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, as we bow our heads again,
[1:48:13] Father,
[1:48:17] Lord God, we're asking that you'd help
[1:48:19] us,
[1:48:22] Lord. We
[1:48:24] I I believe we we see
[1:48:28] that it's impossible for us as human
[1:48:30] beings
[1:48:32] to love in this way.
[1:48:35] It breaks my heart really
[1:48:38] because many people think they have this
[1:48:41] love.
[1:48:42] They think just because they become a
[1:48:44] Christian, they get it then.
[1:48:47] And they do get certainly
[1:48:51] a greater dis dispensation of love and a
[1:48:54] greater portion of love than they had
[1:48:57] before. And they're convinced it's
[1:48:59] agape.
[1:49:02] Lord, I'm convinced even around our
[1:49:04] ranks, that's where many people are.
[1:49:08] Justification is a powerful thing.
[1:49:10] Sanctification a powerful thing.
[1:49:13] And many are convinced that they're
[1:49:14] truly born again
[1:49:17] because their life has been changed. We
[1:49:19] thank you for those changes.
[1:49:21] But Lord, we want those changes to
[1:49:23] continue on
[1:49:25] to we can dwell in you.
[1:49:29] You can dwell in us.
[1:49:32] That don't mean Lord we'll agree with
[1:49:34] everybody on every point of doctrine or
[1:49:36] every way they do this or that or the
[1:49:38] other. Of course not.
[1:49:41] I'm the oldest of seven kids and
[1:49:45] we as siblings certainly didn't agree.
[1:49:48] But those of us that are still on the
[1:49:50] earth, one of them taken away from us,
[1:49:52] we still don't agree on things.
[1:49:55] But we're still brothers and sisters.
[1:50:00] Same mama, same daddy.
[1:50:03] Look at our family tree. There's no
[1:50:06] evidence. There's no way that they could
[1:50:08] take any of it away.
[1:50:10] that we're of the same
[1:50:12] parents. Lord, now we want to look today
[1:50:16] at another tree.
[1:50:19] There's no mother in this tree.
[1:50:22] It's only the man tree.
[1:50:25] We want and we're looking and searching
[1:50:28] for the evidence.
[1:50:31] How can I know if I'm ready? How can I
[1:50:34] know
[1:50:36] if I have the Holy Ghost? How can I know
[1:50:39] that if the Lord Jesus were to come at
[1:50:42] 3:00 this afternoon that I would leave
[1:50:45] this world in a rapture? How can I know?
[1:50:50] Could we have a measuring tape and
[1:50:51] measure the sister's hair, the length of
[1:50:53] it?
[1:50:55] Well, if it has to be a certain length
[1:50:57] and some of the sisters I've seen in
[1:50:59] Africa
[1:51:01] and those subsaharan
[1:51:03] places where I've been,
[1:51:05] my hair is as long as some of them
[1:51:07] sisters there cuz it does not grow long.
[1:51:13] So, it's the length of their hair and it
[1:51:15] has to be down their back.
[1:51:17] So, that means some of those sisters
[1:51:18] won't go although they never cut their
[1:51:22] hair.
[1:51:23] If it has to be, well, you've got to
[1:51:25] you've got to do this or you got to do
[1:51:27] that. John simplified it for us.
[1:51:33] Hallelujah.
[1:51:37] We love the brethren
[1:51:40] and we can't do that unless we love you.
[1:51:43] Right.
[1:51:47] Lord, help us to see when we talk about
[1:51:49] one another and we run one another down
[1:51:51] and we spread rumors about one another
[1:51:53] and do all kinds of things
[1:51:56] against our brothers and sisters.
[1:51:59] That's not the love of God.
[1:52:03] That's not the way you do us.
[1:52:07] How do we want you to treat us in
[1:52:11] heaven?
[1:52:13] That gives us a pretty good idea of how
[1:52:15] you want us to treat the rest of your
[1:52:18] family on earth.
[1:52:21] So, are you constantly bringing up my
[1:52:23] faults before the father and the angels?
[1:52:28] Are you constantly
[1:52:30] reminding them of how many times you've
[1:52:33] had to forgive me?
[1:52:36] Are you holding grudges against me when
[1:52:39] I go to pray
[1:52:41] and you shun me and won't speak to me
[1:52:45] cuz I hurt your feelings?
[1:52:47] I'd hate to think about to today how
[1:52:50] many times I've hurt you since I've been
[1:52:51] a Christian.
[1:52:55] I probably would be so ashamed and so
[1:52:58] embarrassed
[1:53:00] if you had kept a tally, a number of my
[1:53:04] faults, my failures, and my wrongdoings.
[1:53:09] I probably would just bow my head and
[1:53:12] walk off this platform and say, "I'm so
[1:53:15] ashamed."
[1:53:17] But yet every time that I come to you,
[1:53:20] you never remind me of the wrong that I
[1:53:23] did, the shortcomings that I have, how
[1:53:27] faulty and flawed that I am.
[1:53:31] But you put your arms around me and let
[1:53:33] me know how much you love me, how you
[1:53:36] gave your life for me.
[1:53:40] So you're not just expressing that love
[1:53:42] from you to me,
[1:53:46] but if we can grasp it, you're teaching
[1:53:49] me how to love my brothers.
[1:53:54] So instead of keeping a record and a
[1:53:57] list of all their faults and flaws
[1:53:59] against me,
[1:54:03] I'm supposed to love them the way you
[1:54:05] love me and never bring it up again.
[1:54:11] Never mention it,
[1:54:14] Lord. And I'll be honest before you
[1:54:15] today. I'll be the first one to say, "I
[1:54:18] need your help, Lord.
[1:54:21] I need to love more like you, Jesus.
[1:54:26] Oh God, we put so much on godliness and
[1:54:29] we say, "That's a godly man. That's a
[1:54:31] godly woman. This is a godly person.
[1:54:34] That's a godly young person." And what
[1:54:36] are we measuring that by? Many times
[1:54:39] it's the way they dress on the outside.
[1:54:41] And yet might have a tongue that rattles
[1:54:43] and rattles and carries on and spreads
[1:54:45] gossip and lies. said, "No, they're not
[1:54:48] godly because godliness is to be like
[1:54:51] God."
[1:54:53] Help us, oh, Father,
[1:54:56] we love you, Jesus.
[1:54:59] Forgive us, Lord. Once again, we ask you
[1:55:02] today, forgive us of our wrongs,
[1:55:05] but we want to ask it in the proper
[1:55:07] light as you taught your disciples how
[1:55:11] to pray.
[1:55:12] Our Father, which art in heaven,
[1:55:17] hallowed be thy name,
[1:55:20] thy kingdom come, thy will be done on
[1:55:24] earth as it is in heaven.
[1:55:28] Give us this day our daily bread. Oh,
[1:55:32] what a prayer you prayed. And then you
[1:55:33] bring the phenomenal aspect and forgive
[1:55:36] us our sins as we forgive those who
[1:55:40] trespass against us.
[1:55:44] And then you told us if you we do not
[1:55:46] forgive those who trespass against us
[1:55:49] neither will your heavenly father
[1:55:51] forgive you. And your prophet quotes
[1:55:53] that in perfect faith and said then we
[1:55:56] see that faith is based upon
[1:55:59] forgiveness.
[1:56:01] Help us Lord Jesus.
[1:56:05] We worship you Lord.
[1:56:09] We worship you Lord.
[1:56:12] Thank you Lord Jesus.
[1:56:16] Would you turn and lay your hand on that
[1:56:18] person standing by you?
[1:56:23] Just offer a word of prayer for them.
[1:56:28] God knows what's in their heart, what's
[1:56:30] in their life, and what they need today.
[1:56:38] Hallelujah.
[1:56:41] Hallelujah.
[1:56:43] Hallelujah.
[1:56:46] Oh Lord God,
[1:56:49] we have our hands laid one upon the
[1:56:51] other, Father, and
[1:56:54] we're praying that you would help us.
[1:56:58] Our church may not be known by many
[1:57:00] things.
[1:57:02] We may not have some of the smartest
[1:57:04] folks. We may not have some of the
[1:57:06] richest in the message. And we may not
[1:57:08] have this or that or the other. But oh
[1:57:10] God, I I ask you, let our church be
[1:57:13] known
[1:57:14] as a church that has the love of God.
[1:57:20] Help us, Jesus.
[1:57:23] It's evident, Father, that even many of
[1:57:25] our preacher brothers in the message
[1:57:28] need more of the love of God.
[1:57:31] preachers falling out with one another
[1:57:33] because of doctrinal differences and
[1:57:35] issues and won't even speak to one
[1:57:38] another and won't even have nothing to
[1:57:40] do with one another and yet say we're
[1:57:42] leading the bride in a rapture. It ain't
[1:57:44] no wonder to me we ain't gone.
[1:57:47] The preachers ain't where they need to
[1:57:49] be themselves.
[1:57:51] Help us, Lord Jesus.
[1:57:54] Begin with me today, Lord, in this
[1:57:57] church.
[1:57:58] Help me, Jesus.
[1:58:01] Help me to be more like you, Father.
[1:58:05] Help me to love the way you loved,
[1:58:08] forgive the way you forgive.
[1:58:12] Oh Jesus, may it be the very heartbeat
[1:58:16] of my life.
[1:58:18] Dear God, your children.
[1:58:21] Oh, we worship you, Lord. Now, just pray
[1:58:24] for that person standing there by you.
[1:58:27] God knows what they have need of.
[1:58:32] Sing there just pray while they're sing.
[1:58:35] Anybody to be like Jesus.
[1:58:43] to be like Jesus.
