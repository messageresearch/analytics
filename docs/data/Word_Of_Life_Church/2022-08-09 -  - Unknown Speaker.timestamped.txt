[4:47] brother donnie here tonight speak to us
[4:49] if he'll just come with this time
[4:51] take the service
[5:02] glad to be here too
[5:05] the ram said that questions and answers
[5:07] can be
[5:09] a little bit treacherous
[5:11] but thankfully we didn't have no
[5:13] treacherous ones in this batch so
[5:16] maybe we can just stand together and
[5:17] we'll we'll pray and ask the lord to
[5:19] help us
[5:22] anybody like to be remembered tonight as
[5:23] we pray just raise your hand with your
[5:25] requests in your heart
[5:27] heavenly father as we've
[5:29] assembled here tonight lord
[5:32] we're still
[5:34] just so grateful
[5:37] for the service that you gave us
[5:38] yesterday
[5:40] your presence was so wonderful
[5:43] and so awesome
[5:45] lord your people responding into that
[5:47] presence
[5:49] i just been thinking about it all day
[5:51] how great it was
[5:53] i can't imagine what it's going to be
[5:54] like when we get there that day father
[5:57] we never have to leave that presence
[5:59] we'll be in that forever
[6:01] but we're here tonight for
[6:04] a better understanding
[6:06] of the things of life
[6:08] lord this is what we're going to deal
[6:10] with tonight is questions from the
[6:12] hearts of these
[6:13] young people things they don't
[6:14] understand or direction that they're
[6:17] looking for in life
[6:19] i pray that you would help me lord
[6:21] you see my heart you know i never ever
[6:25] want to mislead
[6:26] or misdirect one's soul
[6:30] i know i have a lot to answer for at
[6:32] that day
[6:33] i pray that you would help me lord that
[6:35] i would only give that which is pleasing
[6:38] to you
[6:39] bless our time together we pray father
[6:41] in the name of the lord jesus amen
[6:44] god bless you you may be seated
[6:48] i thought it might be a little bit
[6:49] better for us if i would uh
[6:51] have the
[6:52] the questions and then uh put it up on
[6:55] the on the board here or the screen
[6:57] rather behind me
[6:58] and then the scriptures and
[7:00] quotes and things that i'll use as well
[7:03] so it would help you to be able to
[7:05] read them
[7:07] i normally study in microsoft word and
[7:10] then i will make a pdf file and
[7:14] send it to my ipad so today i had the
[7:16] bright idea of just sending that pdf
[7:18] file to the brother so they had to
[7:20] totally redo it
[7:22] so hopefully it's going to be
[7:24] legible where you can be able to rig it
[7:26] so brother josiah was
[7:28] really working hard up here to get it
[7:30] get it going
[7:32] so here's the first question that we'd
[7:33] like to look at tonight
[7:35] how do you know
[7:36] when god
[7:37] is leading you
[7:39] to do something
[7:41] now this is not something that just
[7:44] pertains to young people as a matter of
[7:46] fact
[7:47] all of us all through our life
[7:49] will
[7:50] be faced with this answer and this
[7:53] question
[7:54] of how can we know when god is leading
[7:58] us in a certain way and we know one
[8:00] thing for sure that god will never lead
[8:02] us contrary to his word
[8:05] but when god gave us the word he didn't
[8:07] tell us the answer to absolutely every
[8:10] decision that we would ever make and god
[8:13] did that for a reason he could have
[8:15] handed you the book of your life when
[8:17] you were born and said now on this day
[8:20] you'll be facing this on this day you'll
[8:21] be facing that and when you do do this
[8:24] and then tomorrow you'll be facing that
[8:26] and when you do do this he could give
[8:28] you every day of your life but that
[8:30] would have made him so impersonal
[8:33] so he give us the things that he
[8:36] determined was necessary and essential
[8:38] in the word and then he gave us
[8:40] preachers that would come of course and
[8:42] be able to preach to us but he left an
[8:44] element of that to where that it would
[8:46] require you and myself to go to him in
[8:50] prayer and petition him and ask him lord
[8:54] what should i do i don't know what to do
[8:56] about this or that or the other
[8:59] but
[8:59] let's start tonight with the book of
[9:01] romans chapter 12 verse 2 and paul says
[9:04] be not conformed to this world but be ye
[9:07] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[9:11] that ye
[9:12] may prove what is the good
[9:16] and acceptable and perfect will of god i
[9:20] love the way that he describes what the
[9:23] will of god is that ye may prove
[9:27] what is the good and acceptable and
[9:30] perfect will of god now we know that god
[9:32] has two aspects to his will one is a
[9:36] permissive will and the other one is his
[9:39] perfect will we are living as far as our
[9:41] natural births
[9:43] by the permissive will never never did
[9:46] god want for us to be born between a man
[9:48] and a woman the way we are but yet god
[9:51] has allowed it to be so and he will work
[9:53] it in to make it fit into his perfect
[9:56] will so how do we know when god is
[9:59] leading us to do something it will
[10:00] always
[10:01] always bring him glory and credit and
[10:05] honor now this this is a very broad
[10:07] spectrum in that it covers
[10:10] your job your vocation the man or woman
[10:13] you're going to marry the place that you
[10:16] might live the church you will go to it
[10:19] will cover every aspect of your life
[10:22] after you're born again and you receive
[10:24] the holy ghost and then you are led by
[10:26] god to the mate that god wants you to
[10:28] have this will be one of the most
[10:30] important things that you'll ever
[10:32] understand about god how to find his
[10:36] will now i don't mind telling you as a
[10:38] preacher
[10:39] i know for myself sometimes the will of
[10:41] god seems like it's so evasive and you
[10:44] search for it and you search and you
[10:47] pray and you ask him and there's times
[10:50] to where that you will do your very best
[10:52] and it seems like it just doesn't work
[10:54] out do i wish it was easier sometimes i
[10:56] do but i figure i'm probably more lazy
[10:59] than what i am
[11:00] because if god just give us that answer
[11:02] as soon as we ask him for it we would be
[11:04] more spoiled and we would expect
[11:06] everything so much faster so sometimes
[11:08] he wants us to actually feel somewhat of
[11:11] a burden notice again in romans 15 32
[11:14] that paul said that i may come unto you
[11:17] with joy by the will of god and may with
[11:21] you be refreshed so here is a church
[11:24] aids messenger a prophet and he was
[11:27] desiring to be able to go somewhere and
[11:29] to be able to preach to the children of
[11:31] god but he wanted to make sure that it
[11:34] was the will of god and colossians
[11:36] chapter 4 verse 12 he mentions another
[11:39] brother here whose name is ephras which
[11:41] is one of you a servant of christ
[11:44] saluteth you always laboring fervently
[11:48] now listen what this brother's call was
[11:50] laboring fervently for you
[11:54] in prayers so we don't have a record
[11:57] that this guy was a preacher we don't
[11:58] have any record that he wanted out being
[12:00] a missionary but his labor of what he
[12:04] the way he labored for the kingdom of
[12:05] god was he labored for the saints of god
[12:09] in prayer what a great thing
[12:12] and this is what he prayed that ye may
[12:15] stand perfect
[12:16] and complete
[12:18] in all
[12:20] the will of god
[12:22] now this is what i find amazing about
[12:24] the will of god that a person may find
[12:26] the right mate totally in the will of
[12:28] god
[12:29] they might find the right job
[12:32] totally in the will of god
[12:34] but they may get in their mind they want
[12:36] to live and say this city versus that
[12:39] city and when they move they totally
[12:41] miss the will of god for that part of
[12:43] their life why no church there no place
[12:46] for them to be able to raise up their
[12:48] children and their family in the right
[12:50] kind of setting to where god wanted them
[12:52] to be so it's amazing that the will of
[12:53] god is not branches on a tree that
[12:55] there's so many aspects to it okay i'm
[12:57] married the right man or the right woman
[12:59] and i'm a christian i'm filled with the
[13:00] holy ghost i know that's the will of god
[13:02] and i'm called to believe the message i
[13:05] believe that's the will of god for my
[13:06] life but yeah i got this idea that i
[13:09] wanted to move to chicago because i've
[13:11] always thought it'd be a great place to
[13:12] live so i want i just want to go there
[13:14] but why do you want to go well i just do
[13:16] i just i just think that would be a
[13:18] great place to live in the will of god
[13:20] in the will of god in the will of god
[13:22] out of the will of god
[13:24] now what's amazing is that that one step
[13:27] out of the will of god
[13:28] can reflect every other aspect
[13:31] that we're in the will of god and
[13:33] pleasing to him so it's it's quite
[13:36] complicated and it's almost like that
[13:38] god allowed it to be in such a way that
[13:41] we as his people would realize we need
[13:45] him so desperately every day of our life
[13:48] because he knows how we are as humans
[13:50] the very best of us will make the wrong
[13:52] choice notice john says in first john
[13:55] chapter 2 verse 17 and the world passeth
[13:58] away and the lust thereof now listen how
[14:01] important that the will of god is but he
[14:04] that does the will of god
[14:07] abide us
[14:08] forever now i wonder how many of us here
[14:11] tonight might be praying about the will
[14:12] of god for a certain thing in our life a
[14:15] certain aspect what many of you are
[14:16] probably no doubt many of that are out
[14:18] out streaming now look at this question
[14:20] again how do you know when god is
[14:23] leading you to do something this is one
[14:25] thing i love about question answers and
[14:27] i'm going to give you one from question
[14:29] answers 1961 how do you feel is the best
[14:32] way to find the lord's will in some
[14:35] important matters i'll tell you dear
[14:38] friend the best way to find the will of
[14:41] god in some important matters
[14:43] is prayer
[14:44] see here's a wonderful little thing if
[14:47] you have a matter that's very important
[14:49] now here's the way i do it i take it
[14:51] before the lord and it's always been my
[14:54] strengths
[14:55] i find this amazing because he didn't
[14:58] say his strengths was being a prophet
[15:01] he didn't say that even his strength was
[15:03] being a preacher or being a pastor but
[15:06] his strengths was finding that he could
[15:09] go to god in prayer and find direction
[15:12] about whatever it was that he was facing
[15:15] i wait upon the lord and see what he
[15:18] says
[15:19] and i just let myself
[15:22] neutral
[15:24] neutral
[15:25] oh how hard this is
[15:27] i let myself neutral to it and don't
[15:31] take
[15:32] either
[15:33] side
[15:34] so you're praying about a certain thing
[15:36] to do in your life
[15:38] if you're honest you'll probably be like
[15:40] me most of us
[15:42] will have an inclination or a desire or
[15:46] a certain side that we want to take now
[15:49] i really believe this is the will of the
[15:52] lord for me to do this now god you just
[15:55] work it out lord that this will be your
[15:57] will
[15:58] we're not praying in neutral
[16:01] we're praying with our minds already
[16:04] made up
[16:05] now
[16:06] if if the will of god
[16:08] was not already difficult enough to find
[16:11] whenever we move out of neutral and we
[16:14] reach over and grab ahold of the gear
[16:16] shift and we pull it down and drive and
[16:19] we've got our foot on the gas at the
[16:21] same time we do it and we are out of
[16:23] here we are convinced i i know i know
[16:26] this is the will of god
[16:28] and this is why we make mistakes
[16:31] it's because we leave out the simple
[16:34] approach to neutrality
[16:37] you see neutrality is so important to
[16:40] god and he knows how opposite that it is
[16:44] to our human nature now
[16:46] it doesn't mean that we're horrible
[16:48] people because we have a certain
[16:50] inclination or a certain desire well i'm
[16:52] hoping this is what god wants i really
[16:54] really hope this is what he wants he
[16:56] knows how we feel and i believe the lord
[16:59] jesus as a man no doubt felt the exact
[17:02] same way about certain things you say
[17:04] how could you say that in the garden of
[17:06] gethsemane if it be thy will let this
[17:10] cut pass for me jesus did not want to
[17:12] die as a man he did not even want to
[17:15] leave his disciples knowing he was going
[17:18] away as a man he did not want to become
[17:21] a curse in the eyes of almighty god so
[17:25] he when he prayed he leaned toward a
[17:29] certain answer but notice the neutrality
[17:32] how powerful that it was nevertheless
[17:36] not my will
[17:38] but i will be done now you see that's
[17:40] not wrong even the lord jesus asked and
[17:43] he prayed a prayer that he knew
[17:46] was not going to be answered if it be
[17:49] thy will let this cup pass from me but
[17:53] at the end of every bit of it his amen
[17:56] was i'm still neutral father
[17:59] and that's what i want
[18:00] now watch how brother branham emphasizes
[18:02] this he said i just let myself neutral
[18:05] to it and i don't take either side
[18:08] saying the heavenly father notice now
[18:10] how he brings this to us of course now
[18:12] in my case most of the time he said
[18:15] if it's very important i'll wait on a
[18:17] vision well that excludes most of us
[18:21] because most of us don't have visions
[18:22] right
[18:23] we don't have visions but many people
[18:26] god doesn't deal with in vision so
[18:28] therefore i wouldn't advise you to do
[18:30] that but because it's some people that
[18:32] has visions and some that's something
[18:34] else where do you see something else
[18:36] that i couldn't do maybe in your way of
[18:38] serving the lord i do something that you
[18:40] couldn't do and god deals with us
[18:42] different so if i was in your place and
[18:46] didn't have visions from before the lord
[18:49] i would wait upon the lord and say lord
[18:51] now you show me
[18:53] what's the decision to make
[18:56] and then the way you feel led then just
[18:59] wait a little bit
[19:01] oh okay now wait a minute
[19:03] so i pray
[19:05] and then i feel that a certain way
[19:07] i don't move immediately
[19:10] i still wait
[19:13] isn't this amazing satan would love for
[19:16] us to be so afraid
[19:18] of missing the will of god that he
[19:21] causes us to jump ahead of the will of
[19:23] god
[19:25] out of what he wants to describe to us
[19:27] as a godly fear now hope you understand
[19:29] what i'm fixing to say
[19:31] god does not he does not hate us
[19:35] god does not get angry at us
[19:38] when we try
[19:40] how we feel led
[19:42] because sometimes it's nothing but the
[19:44] devil leading us
[19:47] well praise the lord that made you all
[19:49] mad now
[19:52] but if we all would be honest i'm sure
[19:54] that we've all felt led
[19:56] to do certain things and it panned out
[19:59] it was not the lord that led us
[20:02] i told the brothers a while ago me
[20:04] apparently sending that file to them in
[20:06] the pdf format format rather i'll just
[20:09] say what some of you say the devil made
[20:11] me do it
[20:14] it definitely wasn't the lord because it
[20:15] caused them all kinds of difficulty and
[20:18] trouble now notice what he said then
[20:21] the way you feel led to do it then wait
[20:23] a little bit
[20:25] and then wait
[20:27] a little while longer
[20:29] wow what a peculiar way to approach the
[20:33] will of god so you're praying and you
[20:35] think you have an answer so you don't
[20:38] move
[20:39] you wait
[20:40] a little bit and then you wait
[20:43] a little while longer but how fast
[20:45] whenever we sing we are led to do
[20:47] something and we jump immediately
[20:51] and then a month later six months later
[20:53] we look back and think
[20:54] dear lord what have i done
[20:57] why we didn't wait we were so afraid we
[21:01] would miss the will of god don't you
[21:03] understand how satan works on us as
[21:05] humans he takes our converted desire
[21:09] and he will play with our minds with
[21:11] that very thing you better do it you
[21:13] better do it you're going to get in
[21:14] trouble god's going to get you no this
[21:16] is what god's prophet taught us you're
[21:19] never going to do wrong by obeying what
[21:21] you're taught
[21:23] now notice he said so which side you
[21:26] lean toward say now father in my heart
[21:29] you know it doesn't matter
[21:32] wow no that's hard to say
[21:34] but i want to know here's the key though
[21:37] i want to know
[21:40] what you want to do about it
[21:43] now this is neutrality again this is the
[21:45] power of neutrality most of us think of
[21:48] neutrality as being powerless we've got
[21:51] it all wrong
[21:52] being neutral is such a powerful
[21:56] wonderful thing now listen he said
[21:58] that's the way i do about meeting
[22:00] sometimes i feel kind of led to go this
[22:03] way or that way then i follow that way
[22:05] that's the way to do it because it's in
[22:07] prayer then and you're doing the best
[22:10] that you can now i believe this as paul
[22:13] friends he said as paul said in the new
[22:15] testament and days gone by he was
[22:17] between
[22:18] two straights
[22:20] which way he should go
[22:22] and he started on the wrong road and he
[22:25] got a macedonian call now you imagine
[22:28] here's a prophet messenger and he makes
[22:30] a decision to go a certain certain way
[22:32] say he's going to go preach at a certain
[22:34] city
[22:35] but it was the wrong call he the lord no
[22:38] no no no no paul no don't don't don't go
[22:41] there
[22:42] and then he sees these people in this
[22:44] dreamer vision and they're from
[22:45] macedonia and they appear to him and
[22:47] they said we want you to come over here
[22:49] and preach to us
[22:51] so paul had to turn and go back and he
[22:54] said i believe that if you are making a
[22:56] decision for god
[22:58] and do it the best that you can
[23:01] i believe god will correct you see
[23:05] to see that you don't go wrong you're
[23:07] talking about a loving father
[23:10] i believe god will do that
[23:14] now whenever we feel led say some of you
[23:17] are
[23:17] seeking god about your vocation well i
[23:20] think i'd like to be a an electrical
[23:23] engineer i'd like to be this i'd like to
[23:25] be that in reality god gives us in the
[23:28] way that he wants us to be i had all
[23:31] kinds of different plans of being this
[23:32] and that and the other and god laughed
[23:33] at my plans and said you ain't gonna be
[23:35] none of them i'm gonna make you a
[23:36] preacher and then whenever god says
[23:38] there's gonna be a preacher okay there's
[23:40] five aspects
[23:41] of being a preacher apostle prophet
[23:44] evangelist pastor teacher and god didn't
[23:46] even ask me which one i wanted to be
[23:48] you're saying now this ain't even right
[23:50] this ain't even right how can that be
[23:52] right he don't even ask me if i want to
[23:54] preach he don't say hey i'm saying about
[23:56] calling you to preach well you think
[23:57] about it you don't pray about it get
[23:59] back with me a few days and let me know
[24:00] what you think you know he don't even
[24:02] ask that and then whenever he wants me
[24:04] to be somebody don't say well i'll tell
[24:05] you what now there's five aspects which
[24:07] woman do you want to be well lord let me
[24:09] think about it i'll get back with you on
[24:10] that so what does god do now people look
[24:12] at a preacher and they think well he's
[24:14] the only one that god does that to no
[24:17] it's not
[24:18] you see god calls us and god gives us
[24:21] certain gifts and certain ability now
[24:23] let me say this to you tonight to
[24:24] encourage each of you no matter how much
[24:26] you made saying i have nothing i have no
[24:28] abilities you should never look at
[24:30] yourself in that way god has called you
[24:33] for specific things and if you all the
[24:36] time going around comparing yourself to
[24:38] this one and that one and the other one
[24:40] you'll never reach the mark of what god
[24:43] wants you to be brother daryl expressed
[24:44] that beautifully a couple weeks ago but
[24:47] yet god has called you so god calls us
[24:50] that way and then god wants us through
[24:52] prayer community of communication by by
[24:54] prayer to god and he will lead us what
[24:57] to do the right vocation so some start
[24:59] in college and they take a major in this
[25:01] and then after they're in there for a
[25:03] couple of months they're saying you know
[25:04] what i hate this i don't want to be this
[25:06] so then they go this way then they go
[25:08] that way and they go that way so you
[25:10] realize as the prophet said it that we
[25:12] would be better off we would save god
[25:14] and ourselves so much trouble in life if
[25:18] we would go to him and say father what
[25:20] do you want me to be
[25:22] what do you want me to become
[25:24] then study with a direction pray with a
[25:29] direction
[25:31] what's this
[25:32] in revelation chapter 4
[25:34] the prophet comes back and he also gives
[25:37] us
[25:38] you all a sheep myself as well believe
[25:41] it or not just because i'm a pastor does
[25:44] not mean that i don't seek counsel
[25:47] because there's situations that i will
[25:50] come up against that maybe i've never
[25:52] dealt with before i'll look in the
[25:54] scriptures if i can find something
[25:56] that's happened before or i will look
[25:58] into the message and see if perhaps
[26:01] someone asks the prophet a question
[26:03] about this or that if i don't find it
[26:05] there and i pray and i can't seem to get
[26:07] into direction i will either call or
[26:10] contact brother tim pruitt brother ron
[26:12] spencer i've got brothers and friends of
[26:14] mine around the world and i will ask him
[26:17] look brothers have you all ever dealt
[26:18] with this have you ever dealt with that
[26:21] why because i'm still learning now here
[26:23] i am been pastoring for 40 years been
[26:25] preaching for longer than that but yet i
[26:28] don't think and i hope i never get to a
[26:30] spot to where i sing i do not need help
[26:33] and counsel and i've found many times
[26:36] that i've got my answer from the lord by
[26:39] talking to other men of god and god
[26:42] allows us to be able to do that now god
[26:44] doesn't give us
[26:46] pastors and friends and things like that
[26:48] so that they will be dictators over our
[26:50] heart or over our face they're there to
[26:53] help us whenever we're seeking god's
[26:56] counsel notice how brother ram goes with
[26:58] this and i said if you ever feel to do
[27:01] something or a revelation
[27:04] or something comes to you strangely
[27:07] something warningly or something be
[27:11] careful
[27:12] satan is as sly
[27:14] and slick as he can be
[27:17] put it with the word of god and consult
[27:22] your pastor
[27:24] now it's amazing how many people
[27:26] will never do that
[27:29] and then they go and make these mistakes
[27:31] in life and they look back and think
[27:33] well god i'd done everything you told me
[27:35] to do no you didn't
[27:37] well i prayed that's only part of what
[27:39] he said well i looked in the bible
[27:42] you're not going to find the word
[27:43] electrical engineer
[27:46] in the bible
[27:47] you're not going to find for some of you
[27:49] sister well i want to be a nurse i want
[27:50] to be an rn i want to be an lpn you're
[27:53] not going to find them in the bible
[27:54] either
[27:55] so there's many things about our life
[27:58] and our vocation that we simply won't
[28:00] find and remember even if you come and
[28:02] talk to me about it it don't mean i've
[28:04] got your answer because god may want to
[28:06] deal with you and you come and run it by
[28:08] me many times all i am as a pastor is
[28:11] simply a sounding board and i remember
[28:14] several years ago there's one of the
[28:15] brothers in our church and he was
[28:16] praying about taking a certain job and a
[28:18] certain thing so i told him i said i'll
[28:20] tell you what brother we're going to say
[28:21] here in the in the room here and i'm
[28:23] just going to listen to you and you talk
[28:24] now what i want you to do is i'm going
[28:26] to put a set of imaginary scales right
[28:29] here on my desk
[28:30] and i said i want you to put everything
[28:33] positive about this job on one side and
[28:36] i don't want you to put everything
[28:38] negative that you know about on the
[28:40] other side well he started
[28:43] well i'll make so much money oh that was
[28:45] a big positive
[28:47] okay so you know i'll i'll have to work
[28:49] and i'll be gone i'll be gone from home
[28:52] but i'll be able to stream services well
[28:54] that was another positive i'll be able
[28:56] to do this and i'll be able to do that
[28:58] so he talked and he taught man the more
[29:00] he taught that scale it was falling
[29:02] plumb off of my desk and every bit of it
[29:05] was positive
[29:08] so he said all that he wanted to say and
[29:10] i said
[29:11] can i say something he said sure that's
[29:13] why i'm here i want your advice
[29:16] so i said i noticed
[29:18] that you left out
[29:20] your wife
[29:22] and i noticed you left out
[29:24] your small children you got some
[29:26] children that's coming into their teens
[29:29] i noticed you didn't mention that is it
[29:31] okay if i put that on this side of the
[29:33] skeleton sure
[29:34] so i said so your wife is going to be
[29:36] here for weeks on end and she will have
[29:38] to be the head of the home right right
[29:41] so you got children and they
[29:43] so as i began to talk now i was not
[29:46] telling him what to do anybody ever
[29:47] talked to me no i i don't go that way
[29:50] what i want to do is to bring to you a
[29:52] balance and help you to look at it in
[29:54] the right way instead of just the
[29:56] one-sided way that most of us tend to
[29:59] look at things at because we are that
[30:01] way it's just humans
[30:03] as i sit there and talk to him and i
[30:06] watch this
[30:07] serious look change from a serious look
[30:10] to a smile
[30:12] and i realized right then
[30:14] he had his answer now i didn't tell him
[30:16] to do anything i didn't tell him you go
[30:18] there you don't do this you do this but
[30:20] all i did was by the spirit of god i
[30:23] helped balance up the scale that he had
[30:26] so improperly balanced
[30:29] and he made the decision totally himself
[30:32] completely
[30:33] now i've learned to realize that a lot
[30:35] of folks on reason that they will not
[30:37] consult the pastor before they make
[30:39] major decisions is because they don't
[30:42] know what he'll tell them
[30:44] and they really don't want to hear it
[30:45] now that's what gets us
[30:47] in serious trouble with god
[30:50] you see the lord loves us so much
[30:54] he will put one
[30:56] hurdle after another after another
[30:59] whenever we're fixing to make a terrible
[31:01] mistake
[31:03] one of the greatest and biggest mistakes
[31:04] you'll ever make in your life
[31:06] is to marry the wrong person
[31:09] and some of you you're single maybe
[31:11] you're looking for a
[31:13] man a woman of your dreams
[31:15] and you say i'm just so lonely i'm just
[31:18] so lonely i want a wife i want a husband
[31:21] i'm just so lonely i'll tell you what's
[31:23] even worse
[31:25] than being single and being lonely
[31:28] being married
[31:29] and being lonely
[31:33] because someone with a beautiful smile
[31:35] or beautiful eyes or whatever more and
[31:37] you overrode that something that that
[31:40] little red flag that little something in
[31:42] your heart that was just no no no no and
[31:46] the more you overrode it you begin to
[31:48] silence that voice
[31:50] i do not believe our father
[31:53] wants any of us to make the wrong
[31:55] choices in life
[31:56] i use this this illustration a lot
[32:01] as i said here in the office and i'm
[32:03] counseling to people and as they look
[32:05] out the blind they're on the outside and
[32:08] i'll tell them
[32:09] you've been up those steps there yes sir
[32:11] i've been up those steps i said so you
[32:12] know there's a really steep bank right
[32:15] there yes sir i know that bank i said
[32:16] okay
[32:17] so we're sitting in the office and we're
[32:19] talking about this and both of us see a
[32:22] small toddler and that toddler's
[32:24] standing right here about where i parked
[32:26] my car
[32:27] and we can see that toddler's hand is
[32:30] going in the direction of that bank we
[32:33] can see the way that toddler is going it
[32:35] has no intentions of stopping
[32:38] what we're talking about is very
[32:39] important that toddler is not yours it's
[32:42] not mine
[32:43] but we would stop our conversation and
[32:46] put it on hold and run out that door and
[32:49] grab that child
[32:51] because we can see that child does not
[32:53] understand by its ability of the depth
[32:56] of perception it does not see what's
[32:58] fixing to happen it could break its neck
[33:01] it could kill itself
[33:02] how cruel we would be
[33:04] if we would sit here and watch that
[33:07] child do that
[33:08] and then i'll turn and always say
[33:11] magnify that by millions and millions of
[33:14] times
[33:15] and imagine your loving heavenly father
[33:18] watching you
[33:20] in a precipice of life
[33:22] seeing you're fixing to make the most
[33:25] horrible decision
[33:27] of your life and him sitting there in
[33:29] heaven and say be careful rob
[33:32] be careful
[33:35] y'all have a safe trip now that's not my
[33:38] father
[33:40] and that's not your father
[33:43] so why is it that so many christians
[33:46] wind up making such a mess
[33:49] out of their life by what
[33:51] the decisions they make and many of them
[33:54] will title them i felt led
[33:58] well you can take my word for this
[34:00] you'd not believe the different things
[34:02] that i've heard that people felt led to
[34:05] do
[34:07] some have felt led to leave their wife
[34:09] and marry somebody else's wife
[34:12] well it wouldn't take much of a bible
[34:14] scholar to tell you that's the devil
[34:15] doing that
[34:17] right some of those things are
[34:18] no-brainers we can look at them and say
[34:21] well my goodness anybody in the right
[34:23] mind would know that but there's other
[34:25] parts about the journey that become a
[34:28] little more complicated
[34:30] so god gives us one barrier after
[34:32] another after another because he loves
[34:36] us
[34:36] so we won't make
[34:38] terrible mistakes
[34:41] clear
[34:42] anybody else anything
[34:44] question on that question
[34:46] okay how do you know when someone
[34:50] is the right one
[34:52] god has for you
[34:54] well it's butterflies
[34:56] don't you
[34:58] i thought everybody
[35:04] it may seem strange to
[35:06] people outside of our ranks but
[35:10] we know that
[35:11] our companion
[35:13] that was given to us
[35:14] by god
[35:16] it's actually not just
[35:18] our choice
[35:20] now it is our choice
[35:22] but when you look at it in reality
[35:25] the church that you go to
[35:28] is not really your choice the pastor
[35:31] that you set under
[35:32] it should not be your choice i mean i i
[35:35] hear it all the time that there's people
[35:37] actually come to happy valley
[35:38] and i wasn't their choice of a bastard
[35:41] that always makes me feel so wonderful
[35:45] i mean they're just being honest they
[35:46] would rather went here and there and
[35:48] there and then they're trying to make a
[35:50] point whenever they will tell me that
[35:52] i'm so glad that they always tell me the
[35:54] point afterwards because i
[35:55] probably just walk away very discouraged
[35:57] but
[35:58] but the point was that brother donald my
[36:00] first choice would have been to go here
[36:02] or there or there but i just kept
[36:04] feeding the lord was leading me here and
[36:06] now i see why because under your
[36:08] ministry we've changed and we've done
[36:10] this and that and the other so it it
[36:12] might be the same way with a mate so the
[36:15] very one
[36:17] that god might have for you initially
[36:20] you might look at them and they might
[36:21] look at you and they might not like you
[36:23] at
[36:24] all
[36:26] and they think what in the world is a
[36:27] matter of that girl what in the world is
[36:29] the matter with that boy sort of like
[36:31] carol did me when we initially met
[36:34] i knew she'd come around bless her heart
[36:38] she was just a little bit slower than me
[36:39] but she finally called up
[36:42] but god when god gives us that something
[36:45] it is truly a revelation
[36:48] now i'm sure that all of you young
[36:50] people sitting here tonight have had
[36:52] revelations from god in your life have
[36:53] you not whether it was serpentine god
[36:55] sending a prophet whatever doctrinal
[36:57] thing and you may have heard it since
[36:59] she was a little boy or a girl but one
[37:02] day reading and reading your bible
[37:04] listening to a tape sitting in a service
[37:06] maybe at a youth camp or a banquet all
[37:08] of a sudden that doctrine that you had
[37:10] heard all of your life and yet a
[37:12] preacher just went a little different
[37:13] angle than the way you'd ever heard it
[37:15] before and it's just like a light bulb
[37:18] switched on and you say oh my goodness i
[37:21] see it oh
[37:23] i see it another thing you see what
[37:25] serpents say serpent seed you've heard
[37:27] that since she was in sunday school but
[37:29] all of a sudden it becomes so real to
[37:31] you what was that a revelation from
[37:34] god and a real mate that god puts
[37:38] together that's what they really are but
[37:41] brother donnie what about the brown eyes
[37:43] and the blue eyes and the broad
[37:44] shoulders and the tall dark and handsome
[37:47] he might be short fat and squatty
[37:54] sister sarah are you saying amen
[37:57] i noticed it was just one-sided there
[38:02] but there's something about it when god
[38:05] puts you together
[38:07] that
[38:08] time can never separate
[38:11] sickness
[38:12] heartache can never separate
[38:15] i love the way that brother random deals
[38:17] with this and kinsmen redeemer when a
[38:19] man loves a woman
[38:21] and marries her because she's just
[38:24] pretty
[38:25] there'll be an end to that
[38:28] but when a man finds a woman
[38:30] that he loves
[38:33] he don't know why
[38:36] now how odd is that
[38:39] now that would be the very opposite of
[38:41] the way most people would describe
[38:43] what we call
[38:45] falling in love
[38:47] y'all familiar with the term right i
[38:49] mean truth goodness that ain't outdated
[38:50] falling in love so some people say it's
[38:53] love at first sight and truly for some
[38:55] it might be that way but for most people
[38:58] it's probably the term that i just used
[39:00] falling in love so you're around that
[39:02] person and you get to liken them more
[39:04] and more and you become more compatible
[39:06] and you all these things are going
[39:07] together so what's happening you're
[39:09] falling in love with that individual
[39:13] but if you can write down
[39:16] all the answers
[39:17] of why you love that person
[39:20] i would advise you not to marry them
[39:28] brother donny
[39:29] you didn't catch the quote
[39:32] he said when a man finds a woman that he
[39:34] loves
[39:36] he don't know why
[39:40] oh she's pretty she's you know her hair
[39:42] is certain certain color her eyes you
[39:44] know he's this tall dark handsome or
[39:47] short
[39:49] whichever
[39:50] and
[39:51] and whenever they you know well and then
[39:54] that well every one of those things you
[39:56] listed
[39:58] might change
[40:00] so as the electrician
[40:03] was up on the roof of a certain baptist
[40:06] church
[40:08] and he's repairing an electrical wire
[40:12] and he gets into that wire
[40:14] and his body grounds the wire
[40:17] and his face
[40:19] a married man with children
[40:21] nearly all of his face caught on fire
[40:24] and burnt off
[40:27] so if his wife
[40:29] married him
[40:31] because he was handsome
[40:33] and she goes to the hospital
[40:35] his flesh is melted he has no eyes no
[40:39] nose true story
[40:41] no lips
[40:42] they do surgery after surgery after
[40:46] surgery
[40:47] as a matter of fact this man is the
[40:48] first one in the united states
[40:51] to get a full face transplant
[40:55] so if she married him because of looks
[40:57] she would have a right to divorce him
[41:00] and marry another
[41:02] but what if she married him
[41:04] because she loved him
[41:06] and she couldn't really define oh yeah
[41:08] his looks was certain certain so and so
[41:10] his eyes his hair this and that and the
[41:12] other you can ask a lot of the men in
[41:14] our church
[41:16] that hair might go in time
[41:20] uh-oh
[41:23] and if it don't turn loose it will turn
[41:25] gray so it's going to turn one way or
[41:28] the other
[41:29] so when a person notice how he says this
[41:32] a man finds a woman he loves her and he
[41:34] don't know why he loves her and she
[41:36] finds the man that she loves
[41:40] boy sisters this is a tough quote to
[41:42] swallow
[41:43] no matter what he looks like
[41:47] brother robbie should have said hey man
[41:48] right there buddy
[41:51] he loves her she loves him
[41:54] listen what this is
[41:56] that's an eternal mate in glory
[41:59] death nor nothing else can ever separate
[42:02] them because they are from eternity
[42:06] and stepped out into a space of time and
[42:10] will return back to eternity eternity
[42:13] has dropped down in a body call time and
[42:16] it goes right back up into eternity
[42:18] again
[42:19] it cannot
[42:21] perish
[42:23] so how do you know when someone is right
[42:25] the right one that god has for you
[42:28] you pray
[42:29] you look at it now there's nothing wrong
[42:31] with looking at the differences that you
[42:33] have and you've heard me say it before
[42:35] that whenever i'm counseling a couple
[42:37] that's going to be
[42:38] engaged to get married and most of them
[42:40] will come to me before they get engaged
[42:41] and we're praying about it and i will
[42:43] ask them do you love each other yes yes
[42:45] have you prayed about it yes if you talk
[42:47] to her father yes we've got his blessing
[42:49] and then i'll say do you like each other
[42:52] yeah that's what they always do they
[42:54] always life why do y'all like when i say
[42:56] that
[42:57] now the reason i ask that is because
[42:59] after counseling 40 plus years
[43:03] of married people what i find is many
[43:06] times things that get on one another is
[43:09] things they don't like about one another
[43:12] it's not that they don't love anyone
[43:14] each other anymore but it's just the
[43:16] habitual day-to-day activity
[43:20] say some of you guys
[43:22] don't pick up your clothes very well
[43:25] now i'm not saying i'm just saying you
[43:27] know i'm just i'm not saying that
[43:28] there's anybody guilty here and you
[43:30] you've got you oh all right we've got a
[43:32] brother here under conviction lay your
[43:33] hand on him mercies
[43:35] so he doesn't pick up his shoes very
[43:37] well and each of us have our makeup the
[43:39] girl was raised in her norm the boy was
[43:42] raised in his norm and when you come
[43:44] together what are you going to do you're
[43:45] going to have trade-offs and you're
[43:47] going to find a new norm and create a
[43:50] new one but the difficult part is being
[43:53] able to merge together but if you've got
[43:55] real love by which you can base it on
[43:57] your love will be stronger than your
[44:00] dislikes for this that another now my
[44:02] wife carol she is a neat neat person
[44:06] i mean she loves neat super neat the
[44:08] more neat the better it is well i'm the
[44:11] type of guy if i'm working on something
[44:13] i've got this drawer open that drawer
[44:15] open this door open it don't make no
[44:17] sense to me to get screw out and put it
[44:20] back together get an open door get
[44:22] another screw out do that that don't
[44:23] make no sense
[44:25] so i've got cabinets down in my basement
[44:27] and i like to build woodworking and
[44:29] taxidermy work and different things that
[44:31] i do down there so i've got cabinets to
[44:32] stand about this tall double doors you
[44:34] open them up well i've got wood here
[44:36] i've got you know feathers over here
[44:38] i've got snake skins here i've got this
[44:40] this this so if i'm doing a taxidermy
[44:42] something for some some of the brothers
[44:44] i may have eight or ten of these
[44:45] cabinets open at one time
[44:48] that is until carol comes downstairs
[44:53] now carol's only going to be there 10 or
[44:55] 15 minutes
[44:57] but as carol comes by each double door
[45:00] them double doors don't close
[45:01] automatically but carol automatically
[45:04] closes them for me
[45:06] so she'll come through and close every
[45:07] one of them
[45:09] and when she leaves now i have to exert
[45:11] more energy to open every one of them
[45:14] back up
[45:15] i see you're laughing
[45:17] but you'd be surprised how many people
[45:20] that i have counseled that have had
[45:21] things just this simple
[45:23] and caused as the office problem ever
[45:25] was oh i dealt with an issue several
[45:28] years ago a man and wife it was nearly
[45:31] it was nearly a divorce case
[45:35] they called me it was screaming it was
[45:38] hollering it was awful
[45:42] and it was simply because she wanted
[45:44] breakfast for supper but he wanted
[45:46] supper for supper
[45:50] you think that's funny did you
[45:52] i'll call you the next time they call me
[45:58] did they love each other of course
[46:01] of course
[46:03] would they wish harm on either one no
[46:06] but it was just the likes
[46:08] and the dislikes
[46:09] real love
[46:11] can look at the flaws of that man that
[46:13] you want to marry
[46:16] and they don't have to say no they don't
[46:18] exist no i closed my eyes to any of her
[46:21] faults you better look at them buddy
[46:24] that's going to be what's going to
[46:25] aggravate you
[46:27] but if you love her more than her faults
[46:30] and you love him more than his faults
[46:32] and his shortcomings ah sounds like to
[46:35] me you all stepped out of eternity
[46:36] together
[46:38] to live here in a body called time
[46:41] so don't be afraid to look at
[46:43] shortcomings and don't be afraid to be
[46:45] able to acknowledge well this is fine
[46:47] knowing that that's okay i have no
[46:48] problem with that because our love will
[46:51] help us to deal with it that's the way
[46:53] real love is
[46:55] that's the way he loves us
[46:57] he looked at us and knew
[47:00] we would cause him so much pain
[47:03] even after we got saved
[47:06] but he loved us so much he said i'm
[47:08] willing i'm willing to embrace you
[47:12] with all your shortcomings aren't you
[47:13] glad boy i'll tell you one thing if
[47:15] jesus didn't love me like that there'll
[47:17] be no hope for me
[47:20] how do you know when someone is right
[47:21] the right one god has for you again
[47:24] approach it prayerfully open-hearted
[47:26] open mind be able to look and see are
[47:29] you compatible and don't just look at
[47:31] him
[47:32] but whenever i'm counseling sisters i
[47:35] will tell them that young man that
[47:37] you're looking at see how he treats his
[47:40] mama
[47:41] see how he treats his sisters if he has
[47:44] them
[47:45] that'll give you a pretty good idea of
[47:47] how he's going to treat you
[47:49] because if he has inferiority complexes
[47:51] toward women if he's raised by a strong
[47:54] woman in the house he may take that out
[47:56] on you
[47:57] once you're married
[47:59] i might not go into this office here and
[48:00] finish this
[48:04] and it's the same way young men whenever
[48:07] you
[48:08] are looking to marry a girl
[48:10] look and see how
[48:12] she treats her daddy
[48:14] look and see how she treats her brothers
[48:16] her uncles
[48:18] look and see how she treats the pastor
[48:21] or other men
[48:23] of authority in her life
[48:26] because don't think she's going to
[48:27] despise the pastor and her father and
[48:29] every other male figure in her life and
[48:32] all of a sudden oh she's just going to
[48:35] melt in your arms
[48:36] and everything is going to be wonderful
[48:39] you're dreaming boy
[48:41] i should say you've got a nightmare
[48:44] why because there's something in her
[48:47] that has molded her that way
[48:49] real love can look at that and see some
[48:51] of y'all think i'll never be buried i'd
[48:53] rather for you to delay it and find the
[48:54] right one i don't want to talk to you
[48:57] all in there
[49:00] right so when it's real love it can look
[49:04] at the flaws the shortcomings the
[49:06] mistakes and there's something in you
[49:08] that drives you toward that individual
[49:10] because it'll be god that pulls you
[49:12] together
[49:14] clear
[49:18] well we've got about 39 pages and we're
[49:21] at page six so far so we're not doing
[49:23] very good
[49:25] how do you know
[49:28] this was an awesome question
[49:31] how do you know
[49:33] when you have the holy ghost
[49:38] saint john 14 16
[49:40] jesus said i will pray the father
[49:44] and he shall give you another comforter
[49:47] that he may abide with you
[49:50] forever
[49:52] now remember jesus
[49:54] not in the trinitarian view
[49:57] is praying to an old man in heaven
[49:59] and then the third person is going to
[50:01] come down
[50:03] but jesus
[50:04] is setting forth the office work of god
[50:08] not three people
[50:10] but offices i am husband
[50:13] i am father
[50:14] i am grandfather i am brother
[50:18] i am uncle
[50:20] i am all them offices but i'm only one
[50:23] person
[50:24] so jesus is praying to who
[50:27] the father that dwells in him
[50:30] and he said even the spirit of truth now
[50:32] jesus uses this several times in the
[50:35] gospels to describe the holy ghost this
[50:37] is what the holy ghost is the spirit
[50:40] of truth so we can have truths
[50:44] and not have the spirit of truth
[50:46] why because we can set under the right
[50:48] kind of teaching and many people have
[50:50] done it for years and years and they
[50:51] have truths but they have it up here and
[50:54] then they get around other people that
[50:55] talk them out of it and then they walk
[50:58] away from that truce that they had but
[51:00] if you get the spirit of truth with
[51:03] truth and it's sealed in your soul
[51:06] nobody can ever talk you out of it
[51:08] so notice jesus doesn't just say
[51:10] that i'll i'll give you the truth but
[51:13] even the spirit of truth whom the world
[51:17] cannot receive now this is why sinner if
[51:20] there would be one here tonight and
[51:21] they'd come up and say i want to get
[51:23] saved well we could not come and say all
[51:25] right let's everybody gather around this
[51:28] center and we're going to pray god will
[51:30] fill them with the holy ghost
[51:32] that's not going to happen
[51:34] they must repent could they get the holy
[51:36] ghost in a few minutes oh yes they could
[51:38] but god ain't going to give them the
[51:40] holy ghost until they repent of their
[51:42] sins and god eradicates that nature but
[51:44] notice jesus identifies it as the spirit
[51:46] of truth whom the world cannot receive
[51:50] because it sees him not
[51:53] neither know us him
[51:57] but you know him
[52:00] for he dwelleth with you
[52:02] and shall be in you so jesus is
[52:04] describing himself this is another
[52:06] reason people can't get the holy ghost
[52:08] they're praying for a third person
[52:11] but jesus said the reason you guys are
[52:13] going to get it is because you know him
[52:16] he dwells with you he dwells with you
[52:19] now
[52:20] but he's going
[52:21] to be in you
[52:24] notice in chain john 14 18 he says
[52:27] i will not leave you comfortless
[52:29] ah well wait a minute i thought he said
[52:32] the holy ghost is going to come
[52:34] he is the holy ghost in another form
[52:38] i will come to you now notice the
[52:41] attributes of the holy ghost saint john
[52:44] 14 26 but the comforter which is the
[52:47] holy ghost whom the father will send in
[52:50] my name he shall teach you
[52:54] all things
[52:55] and bring all things to your remembrance
[53:00] whatsoever i've said unto you saint john
[53:03] 15 26
[53:04] but when the comforter is come
[53:07] whom i will send unto you from the
[53:09] father well now wait a minute i thought
[53:10] jesus said the father was going to send
[53:13] it in his name
[53:14] now jesus said he's sending it from the
[53:17] father
[53:20] if these ain't the same people we've got
[53:22] about two or three different holy ghosts
[53:24] and we've got two or three people
[53:25] sinning it i remember when i was over in
[53:27] china several years ago all them folks
[53:29] that were still struggling with the
[53:30] godhead so the lord placed it on my
[53:32] heart to be able to approach it from the
[53:34] old testament and the new testament and
[53:37] the lord began to quicken some things to
[53:39] me where god said in the old testament
[53:42] he was the first and the last then i
[53:44] come to the new testament jesus said he
[53:46] was the first and he was the last god
[53:49] said this and this and this in the old
[53:51] testament jesus said the very same words
[53:53] in the new testament and then as the
[53:55] spirit of god began to bring that
[53:57] together and i brought it to those
[53:58] chinese believers and they begin to see
[54:01] themselves from their own bible that
[54:04] either this person was the very same one
[54:07] or there's two firsts and two lasts
[54:11] two beginnings or two gods
[54:13] and you know what they're sent them
[54:15] chinese christians and more here tonight
[54:17] than there were there in that particular
[54:18] meeting but they sat there and the
[54:20] spirit of god and i watched it over this
[54:22] person and that one and that one and
[54:24] that one and their eyes come open
[54:26] brother rob it was absolutely phenomenal
[54:29] to watch the spirit of god is he
[54:30] quickened and opened their eyes to that
[54:33] understanding so this is one reason why
[54:36] people cannot receive the holy ghost
[54:38] because they're praying to a person
[54:41] that does not exist
[54:44] holy spirit come holy spirit holy spirit
[54:47] please holy spirit third person of the
[54:49] godhead come into me they're praying to
[54:53] a false
[54:54] god
[54:58] that's heavy
[55:01] so when you pray for the holy ghost
[55:02] you're not praying to a second person or
[55:04] a third person but you're praying to the
[55:07] almighty
[55:08] the one and true and living god for him
[55:11] to come into you
[55:13] in the form of the holy ghost what is
[55:16] the holy ghost it's the god form that
[55:20] can come into us human beings
[55:22] you see we could not receive that form
[55:25] that's in the heaven that is called
[55:27] theos
[55:29] that is the infinite the ineffable
[55:32] that's the everything the eternal
[55:34] there's no way i could contain that
[55:36] so god condescended in a form called the
[55:40] baptism of the holy ghost and he said
[55:42] here donnie i'll come down in such a
[55:45] form that you can receive me it's still
[55:47] me and the same contents that's in this
[55:50] gatorade right here is in one drop or a
[55:53] whole bottle or a whole building full
[55:56] in eternity is the whole building full
[55:59] as we'd say but my baptism is one drop
[56:04] now notice in saint john 16 13 how be it
[56:07] when he
[56:08] the spirit of truth has come here's the
[56:11] evidence
[56:12] he will guide you into all truth
[56:18] so the holy ghost will guide you into
[56:20] all truths
[56:21] which will include luke 17 30.
[56:24] malachi 4
[56:26] revelation 10.
[56:28] so he doesn't just lead you to preaching
[56:31] on the cross now you see people
[56:32] misunderstand us when we say that are
[56:34] you against the cross no
[56:36] but there's so much more
[56:38] than just the cross
[56:40] watch people who stop at the cross
[56:42] see how far they go
[56:44] in god as if though god
[56:47] made all these mistakes by inspiring his
[56:49] men to write all these other things in
[56:52] the bible
[56:53] i want you to think of this john the
[56:55] beloved was the only apostle
[56:58] that stood at the foot of the cross
[57:02] when you get time
[57:03] i'd like for you to do a bible search
[57:05] for me
[57:07] you can do it online if you don't have
[57:08] software on your phone
[57:10] and see how many times john
[57:12] mentions the word
[57:14] cross
[57:17] and yet this man saw it
[57:19] himself
[57:21] but he mentions it less
[57:23] than some of the other writers you think
[57:24] well my goodness he's the guy who saw it
[57:27] he did see it
[57:28] but yet
[57:29] how come he didn't preach it more than
[57:31] paul how come he didn't preach it more
[57:33] than peter more than jude
[57:37] the same man who saw the cross was the
[57:40] same one who preached about seven seals
[57:42] seven thunders seven church ages one
[57:45] mystery after another after another
[57:48] after another
[57:49] why why why would he do that
[57:52] because he saw the cross was the bridge
[57:55] that placed us on the other side back
[57:57] into the presence of god and made a way
[58:00] for all the rest of these other other
[58:02] things
[58:03] to be understood by the grace of god
[58:06] oh
[58:07] how could we ever get to god without the
[58:09] cross there's no way this is god's way
[58:13] but it is just the beginning to get us
[58:17] to his presence
[58:18] let me read a couple more scriptures ken
[58:20] it's time for us to stop ephesians
[58:22] chapter 2 verse 1
[58:23] and you
[58:24] has he quickened now remember this
[58:26] question what it was
[58:28] how can you how do you know when you
[58:30] have the holy ghost look at these
[58:31] scriptures he'll lead and guide you into
[58:33] all truth he'll guide you into the ways
[58:35] of the word of god he will be a
[58:37] comforter the word comfort there's a
[58:39] greek word paraquatos which is one
[58:41] that's called alongside to help
[58:44] you see the spirit of god doesn't just
[58:46] want to be the pastor god don't want me
[58:48] to be your holy ghost god don't want
[58:50] your mom and daddy to be your holy ghost
[58:52] he wants you to have the baptism of the
[58:54] holy ghost just like your mama just like
[58:56] your daddy just like every other
[58:58] individual on the earth that's had it
[58:59] and he wants to be able to guide you
[59:02] through the things of life but notice
[59:04] paul says you hath he quickened who were
[59:06] dead and trespasses and sins now this is
[59:10] before we got converted
[59:12] where in time passed you walked
[59:14] according to the course of this world
[59:16] according to the prince of the power of
[59:18] the heir the spirit that now worketh in
[59:20] the children of disobedience this is
[59:22] before we got the holy ghost
[59:23] among whom also we all had our
[59:25] conversation in times past in the lust
[59:28] of the flesh fulfilling the desires of
[59:30] the flesh and of the mind
[59:32] this is pre-holy ghost
[59:35] so people that lust that lie that commit
[59:38] adultery that do many of these things
[59:40] and they profess christianity i'm not
[59:43] going to say they're not a christian i'm
[59:45] not going to say that they're not
[59:46] looking to the lord for their salvation
[59:49] but i will say they don't have the holy
[59:51] ghost
[59:52] because the holy ghost delivers us from
[59:54] such a life if he don't what good does
[59:57] it do to have the holy ghost
[1:00:01] among whom now notice how paul puts it
[1:00:03] in the past for those that are converted
[1:00:06] among whom also we all
[1:00:09] had our conversation in times
[1:00:12] past
[1:00:14] not ongoing since we've got the holy
[1:00:16] ghost but this was before we got
[1:00:19] converted
[1:00:20] in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[1:00:23] desires of the flesh and of the mind and
[1:00:26] were by nature
[1:00:29] children of wrath
[1:00:31] even as others so what does the holy
[1:00:33] ghost do changes your desires
[1:00:36] changes your nature how will you know if
[1:00:39] you got the holy ghost well you'll love
[1:00:41] the things of god
[1:00:42] you'll love his word now that don't mean
[1:00:44] you're not going to fight this battle
[1:00:46] because this don't have the holy ghost
[1:00:47] you all understand that right and it
[1:00:49] will be carnal sticky it'll bother you
[1:00:52] as long as you live
[1:00:54] that's right first john 3 14 we know
[1:00:58] we know
[1:00:59] that we have passed from death unto life
[1:01:02] because
[1:01:05] read it with me
[1:01:08] we know we have passed from death unto
[1:01:10] life so it's not guessing i'm hoping
[1:01:13] well i hope i am well we can know beyond
[1:01:17] the shadow of a doubt
[1:01:18] that we have passed from deaths unto
[1:01:21] life because we love the brethren
[1:01:24] he that love us not his brother
[1:01:28] abide us in death
[1:01:31] and whosoever hate us his brother
[1:01:37] is what
[1:01:39] a murderer
[1:01:42] a murderer
[1:01:44] and you know no
[1:01:46] murderer
[1:01:48] has eternal life
[1:01:50] abiding in him
[1:01:54] so anyone oh you said well i don't like
[1:01:56] the way they do but do you hate them
[1:01:59] there's a great difference in not liking
[1:02:01] the way a brother does this or a sister
[1:02:03] does that and not liking their
[1:02:05] mannerisms and we've all got that oh
[1:02:07] this is one reason why we all need a
[1:02:09] body change thank god we're going to be
[1:02:10] set free from ourselves
[1:02:12] can i go can i have just a couple more
[1:02:14] minutes and we'll stop right here
[1:02:16] this is a private interview it was uh
[1:02:19] from a sister by the name of sister
[1:02:20] georgie bruce
[1:02:22] she went to the branham tabernacle and
[1:02:23] went there for many many years
[1:02:26] she recorded this private interview and
[1:02:29] several years ago they made it public
[1:02:31] sister bruce says
[1:02:33] but i've never had an experience
[1:02:36] that i have been filled with the holy
[1:02:38] ghost now listen to this carefully
[1:02:40] that i could put my foot on
[1:02:47] all right notice this now this is
[1:02:48] brother branham
[1:02:50] ordinarily a human being born in sin
[1:02:52] shape and liquid come the world speaking
[1:02:54] lies that's the nature of a human being
[1:02:56] sister bruce says yes
[1:02:58] that was our nature it changed once but
[1:03:01] what changed it she answers christ
[1:03:05] there you are sister
[1:03:08] see that's it
[1:03:09] he that hearst my words and believeth on
[1:03:12] him that sent me now remember
[1:03:14] this
[1:03:15] is july the 5th
[1:03:18] 1964
[1:03:20] has eternal life and shall not come into
[1:03:22] judgment but at past tense past from
[1:03:25] death unto life saint john 5 24
[1:03:28] jesus speaking and you're a christian
[1:03:31] sister bruce i've watched your life
[1:03:34] now listen to this
[1:03:36] i've watched you
[1:03:38] under
[1:03:39] vision
[1:03:43] and i know
[1:03:46] you're a christian
[1:03:48] all i can say is it's a good thing i
[1:03:50] wouldn't in that interview
[1:03:52] if that name would have been instead of
[1:03:54] sister bruce had been brother donnie
[1:03:56] reagan
[1:03:57] and that prophet looked at me and said
[1:03:59] donny
[1:04:00] i've watched your life by vision
[1:04:04] i'd said where you want a new outdoor in
[1:04:06] this office
[1:04:07] i'd have had myself a spell
[1:04:09] but i believe with all of my heart we
[1:04:12] can be just as sure
[1:04:14] as sister georgia bruce was
[1:04:17] now that wasn't enough
[1:04:20] he goes on to say see
[1:04:23] i'm your shepherd
[1:04:25] as it was
[1:04:26] and sister bruce says yes
[1:04:30] somebody to help which is what a
[1:04:32] shepherd is of course
[1:04:34] see if there was any doubt
[1:04:37] in my mind if i thought
[1:04:40] there was something wrong
[1:04:42] i'd tell you sister bruce she says i
[1:04:45] believe that
[1:04:47] but if there's anything wrong
[1:04:50] in your experience
[1:04:52] anything between you and god
[1:04:57] as far as i know anything about his
[1:05:00] sister bruce
[1:05:02] there's not
[1:05:05] a thing
[1:05:10] i don't think we could have anything
[1:05:12] ever
[1:05:13] better said to us in our life
[1:05:17] how awesome
[1:05:18] that would be in this place
[1:05:22] if every one of us could have that
[1:05:23] assurance
[1:05:25] there's nothing
[1:05:27] between you and god tonight
[1:05:32] praise the lord
[1:05:34] sister bruce
[1:05:36] there's not
[1:05:38] one thing
[1:05:41] now we'll stop we'll pick that up again
[1:05:42] because i've got several more things
[1:05:44] here that i'm going to go into i don't i
[1:05:45] don't want to rush it
[1:05:48] let's just buy our heads
[1:05:55] lord jesus i sent your presence
[1:06:02] thank you that it worked out this way
[1:06:03] lord i prayed how to even
[1:06:05] put these questions in order
[1:06:08] i see why you had me to put them the way
[1:06:10] that i did
[1:06:12] you knew it would work out this
[1:06:13] appropriate time
[1:06:16] or jesus may you search each of our
[1:06:18] hearts tonight
[1:06:21] we want your will yes
[1:06:23] we want the right mate in life
[1:06:26] if you've called us to be a carpenter a
[1:06:28] painter or a
[1:06:29] real estate agent or whatever it is
[1:06:31] father we want that
[1:06:33] but oh lord to know
[1:06:36] that there's nothing
[1:06:37] between us
[1:06:39] and our savior
[1:06:41] what would it be worse
[1:06:43] to each of us tonight in this building
[1:06:45] and those that are streaming
[1:06:47] to know there's nothing
[1:06:50] between us and you
[1:06:52] i don't believe you love sister georgia
[1:06:54] bruce
[1:06:55] more than you love us
[1:06:58] just a simple little woman
[1:07:00] a woman that was not a great theologian
[1:07:03] a woman that probably the world would
[1:07:06] have looked at and turned up their nose
[1:07:08] at her
[1:07:09] but what an answer she got from the
[1:07:12] presence of god
[1:07:14] lord jesus i believe you desire
[1:07:17] by your presence tonight
[1:07:19] to make that just as real to us
[1:07:22] that each of us can know
[1:07:25] it is well
[1:07:27] with my soul
[1:07:29] there's nothing
[1:07:31] between me and my savior
[1:07:34] would you deal with each of our hearts
[1:07:36] father
[1:07:38] with our heads bowed i wonder
[1:07:40] not only just in the visible audience
[1:07:42] but those that have streamed and those
[1:07:44] that'll go back and archive this later
[1:07:47] i wonder how many of us here
[1:07:50] just by raising our hands say lord
[1:07:52] that's what i want more than
[1:07:54] anything but i can know there's nothing
[1:07:58] between me and you
[1:08:00] not temper
[1:08:02] not any besetting sin
[1:08:04] lord not lust not lying nothing
[1:08:08] nothing
[1:08:09] jealousy hatred
[1:08:12] nothing lord between me and you
[1:08:15] now i don't believe it's just something
[1:08:17] that the lord wants to happen here this
[1:08:19] monday night
[1:08:21] and then we lose it no i believe he
[1:08:23] wants us to live there
[1:08:25] so every day of our life but brother
[1:08:28] donald what if i mess up he's made a way
[1:08:30] for us
[1:08:31] john said little children i write unto
[1:08:34] you that you sin not but if any man's
[1:08:37] sin
[1:08:38] we have a perpetuation
[1:08:41] a go-between
[1:08:42] we have an atonement or a sacrifice
[1:08:46] which is jesus christ the righteous
[1:08:49] he's the one who made a way god don't
[1:08:51] want us to miss the mark and that's what
[1:08:53] the word sin means
[1:08:55] to miss the mark
[1:08:57] so what do we do when we miss it we ask
[1:09:00] him to forgive us
[1:09:01] and help us to overcome that so we don't
[1:09:04] fall into that trap again
[1:09:06] how many of you want that in your life
[1:09:08] tonight would you just raise your hand
[1:09:09] to the lord
[1:09:11] god bless you
[1:09:12] would you mind
[1:09:14] just putting your hand on that person's
[1:09:15] shoulder maybe sitting there near you
[1:09:19] let's just offer a word of prayer for
[1:09:21] each other
[1:09:23] lord jesus we bring our
[1:09:26] our brothers and sisters our friends
[1:09:28] maybe it's a sister in the flesh even a
[1:09:30] brother in the flesh
[1:09:32] lord god we bring each other we're not
[1:09:34] praying for ourselves now
[1:09:37] but we're asking you tonight father
[1:09:40] lord is the pastor of this assembly
[1:09:42] i don't know of anything greater
[1:09:45] i could ask for lord but that each of
[1:09:49] these sheep
[1:09:50] could have this in their life
[1:09:52] not only them but their mothers and
[1:09:54] fathers and their grandmothers and
[1:09:56] grandfathers and
[1:09:57] every individual lord
[1:09:59] those around the world that call this
[1:10:01] their home church father they have no
[1:10:03] church to attend where they live
[1:10:05] lord that each of them
[1:10:07] father god they can have this testimony
[1:10:10] heavenly father that they
[1:10:12] they feel there's nothing between you
[1:10:14] and them oh what a victory we would have
[1:10:17] in our lives lord jesus
[1:10:20] and we know that involves so much that
[1:10:22] involves our everyday walk and making
[1:10:24] the right choices and praying over
[1:10:26] things and going about things the way
[1:10:28] you've laid it out for us
[1:10:30] help us father if there's one here
[1:10:32] tonight they've missed the will of god
[1:10:33] somehow help them lord to realize they
[1:10:36] just go back they just they just simply
[1:10:37] go back and say lord i missed you i'm
[1:10:40] sorry about that i want to start over
[1:10:42] again
[1:10:43] lord help us to realize that's what it
[1:10:45] takes real believers the zeal of this
[1:10:47] hour is repent
[1:10:50] and that's what we always want to be
[1:10:51] able to do it's one great difference
[1:10:53] that we notice between saul and david
[1:10:56] david had his mistakes and his errors
[1:10:58] but saul could never admit he was
[1:11:01] completely wrong himself he wanted to
[1:11:03] blame it on this one and that one and
[1:11:05] the other well the people wanted me to
[1:11:07] do it the people wanted this and the
[1:11:09] people wanted that
[1:11:11] but yet david was a man after god's own
[1:11:14] heart
[1:11:15] he was not perfect he was not without
[1:11:18] his flaws
[1:11:19] but there's one thing david knew how to
[1:11:21] do
[1:11:22] he knew how to repent and he knew how to
[1:11:25] repent fast
[1:11:26] when the prophet stood there and said
[1:11:29] david thou art to man
[1:11:31] within a few seconds the judgment of god
[1:11:34] would have thundered from that prophet's
[1:11:36] mouse
[1:11:37] but david repented immediately in his
[1:11:40] heart
[1:11:41] and the next words to come out of that
[1:11:43] prophet's lips was not i condemn you to
[1:11:45] death
[1:11:46] it was not you will die
[1:11:49] but the next words that come out of his
[1:11:51] lips was
[1:11:52] you shall not surely die
[1:11:55] why because david knew how to repent
[1:11:59] and repent quickly
[1:12:01] lord may we always know how to do that
[1:12:05] when we make our mistakes when we make
[1:12:07] the wrong choices whatever it is in life
[1:12:10] may we be able to quickly repent
[1:12:12] go back and start over again father
[1:12:15] thank you for our time together tonight
[1:12:17] lord
[1:12:19] i pray that it was pleasing to your
[1:12:21] father
[1:12:23] we love you in the name of the lord
[1:12:25] jesus
[1:12:26] praise the lord
[1:12:29] can we stand our feet
[1:12:33] maybe they'll come and just sing
[1:12:36] sing a little song together as we
[1:12:39] worship the lord for just a few minutes
[1:12:41] before we go
[1:12:43] thank you for coming tonight
[1:12:46] at this rate it may take us a little
[1:12:48] while to get to all of them but we'll do
[1:12:50] our best so
[1:12:51] god bless you
[1:12:53] don't you just love him with all your
[1:12:54] heart
[1:12:56] some of you will never make
[1:12:58] the who's who
[1:13:00] you'll never be a great renowned
[1:13:02] scientist maybe or a doctor that'll find
[1:13:05] some cure for
[1:13:07] some terrible disease

[1:13:41] lives may be so small in the eyes of the
[1:13:43] world but remember he loved you so much
[1:13:46] i believed he would have died for you if
[1:13:49] you were the only one that was on the
[1:13:51] earth
[1:13:52] he would have done it for you
[1:13:55] though jesse just sing something for us

[1:22:33] god bless you all you are dismissed in
[1:22:34] the fear of the lord
[1:22:40] let's hear it again for brother donnie
[1:22:42] that was outstanding
[1:22:45] i want to thank you so much for studying
[1:22:48] and and making things so clear and i
[1:22:49] just want to tell you when i first
[1:22:51] before i started coming to church i'll
[1:22:53] just give you a little testimony one of
[1:22:54] the things that got my attention
[1:22:56] was brother larry elliott had had worked
[1:22:58] with me and we went to lunch every day
[1:23:01] and there would be a bible question that
[1:23:02] would come up and we're in the bible
[1:23:04] belt and everyone has an opinion and we
[1:23:06] would have this person from this
[1:23:07] denomination give their opinion on a
[1:23:08] question and it would go around the
[1:23:10] table and when that when the message
[1:23:12] came forth it's like i recognize that
[1:23:14] voice
[1:23:15] there's something behind it and it's
[1:23:16] like that's the answer
[1:23:18] and there are so many things and i
[1:23:19] started i got my attention i started
[1:23:21] reading the message and i started seeing
[1:23:22] there are answers to life's questions my
[1:23:25] concern for you being younger i've i can
[1:23:27] associate with a lot of these things
[1:23:28] because i am older and i've had more
[1:23:30] time for mistakes and learning from
[1:23:32] mistakes the joy of the message is that
[1:23:34] you can learn what god has for you
[1:23:37] before you make that mistake it may
[1:23:39] cause you all kinds of pain and it's
[1:23:41] something it was i marveled at the fact
[1:23:43] that there was answers in the message
[1:23:45] there was answers to life and questions
[1:23:47] that men have wondered for
[1:23:50] as long as human history what those
[1:23:51] answers are and if things are there and
