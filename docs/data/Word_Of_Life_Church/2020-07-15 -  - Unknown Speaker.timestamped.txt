[0:00] and you two lived in the first century
[0:01] which one of the churches that I just
[0:04] mentioned would you'd went to I'll tell
[0:08] you let me look at your makeup and I'll
[0:11] tell you if you'd had the choice some
[0:14] you don't want to Corinth no question
[0:15] about it
[0:16] some of you want allure to the Ephesian
[0:19] Church because you deem yourself
[0:20] theologians you considered yourself
[0:27] sodium you never went to that collation
[0:30] sir Wow they questioned the Prophet I
[0:32] got I wouldn't sell unbelievers but all
[0:39] of them and if you had the Holy Ghost
[0:41] you get all of them you might not have
[0:43] understood how they listen to some liar
[0:45] to try to tell you the pollen a prophet
[0:47] of God
[0:48] but you love them anyhow right so which
[0:52] church would you went to and yet Paul
[0:55] said these with the Holy Ghost love all
[0:58] the saints you imagine if they ever had
[1:00] fellowship means and you've got a
[1:01] Christian believer sent my son in
[1:03] Ephesians believer that Corinthian
[1:06] believers just bouncing off the peace Oh
[1:08] glory to conquer that deep Ephesian
[1:12] theologians Oh God I see the devil got
[1:20] on me to set by you I definitely wasn't
[1:24] letter the Lord to sit on the same hue
[1:25] you said huh I must have been strictly
[1:28] in the flesh and then the Galatian
[1:31] believer over here and I thought that's
[1:33] not like a believer over there but all
[1:35] of those that have the Holy Ghost and
[1:37] Ephesian believer we've been able to go
[1:40] up and grab the hand of a Christian
[1:42] believer if it is stood still long
[1:43] enough huh hit him on over and grab
[1:45] ahold of his head and put his arm around
[1:47] me I love brother I love you god bless
[1:58] you see you some other time
[2:03] not us we ignore them stay away from
[2:11] them because we don't like them
[2:17] now remember hatred friends you can't go
[2:20] by your definition of hatred hatred is
[2:24] just several degrees farther than
[2:27] dislike it's a detestable dislike that
[2:31] you have for an individual if God were
[2:34] to weigh us out in this building tonight
[2:36] or in this message I wonder how much
[2:37] hatred would be all inside the ranks of
[2:39] this message or inside this church
