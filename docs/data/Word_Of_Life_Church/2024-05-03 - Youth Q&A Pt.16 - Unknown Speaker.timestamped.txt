[17:13] in Jesus Christ's name
[17:16] amen praise the Lord a't it awesome for
[17:20] us to be able to be gathered together
[17:22] again tonight in the presence of the
[17:24] Lord there's one thing about questions
[17:27] that I've found over the years
[17:29] they can be very very
[17:34] interesting and very
[17:36] scary especially if you're the guy
[17:38] standing up here trying to answer
[17:41] them but I've learned something many
[17:45] many years ago being asked
[17:48] questions I've had different youth U
[17:50] meetings in different parts of the world
[17:52] and um I found that if I will always
[17:57] approach a question in the right way
[18:01] sometimes I've been asked questions and
[18:03] I could tell by the attitude of the
[18:05] person that was writing it that their
[18:08] attitude wasn't quite right but the Lord
[18:12] helped me to see many many years ago if
[18:14] I will approach it the right way whether
[18:16] or not people ask it in the right way
[18:19] he'll still help me with it and I've
[18:22] never seen that fail and I'm so grateful
[18:24] for
[18:26] that so let's uh
[18:29] start with this question tonight good
[18:31] question a couple different people asked
[18:33] this one but worded it a little bit
[18:36] different if Jesus turned water into
[18:40] wine why can't we drink
[18:43] it now let me just give you the short
[18:46] answer of that and then uh a whole bunch
[18:49] of scriptures and a whole bunch of
[18:51] History afterwards I'll answer it
[18:54] again we can
[18:56] drink the same kind of wine
[19:00] that Jesus
[19:03] made but it's probably not the kind
[19:06] you're thinking
[19:07] about you can be
[19:11] seated turn with me to Genesis chapter 9
[19:14] verse
[19:16] 20 now this is the first time that the
[19:18] Bible before we go into St John which is
[19:22] the one that tells about the wedding at
[19:24] Canaan and where Jesus turned the water
[19:27] into wine let's uh look a little bit
[19:30] first about what the Old Testament Tau
[19:35] about wine about
[19:38] liquor about
[19:40] drinking and then we'll come up to where
[19:44] Jesus did this miracle and I believe if
[19:47] we look at it from that perspective
[19:50] you'll probably see the answer before I
[19:52] ever even give it to you Genesis 9: 20
[19:57] and Noah began to be an husbandman and
[20:00] he planted a Vineyard and he
[20:04] drank of the wine and was
[20:09] drunken and he was
[20:11] uncovered within his
[20:14] tent now remember this is after what we
[20:17] talked about last night the flood when
[20:19] God had destroyed the majority of
[20:22] humanity and most of the living
[20:24] creatures which is upon the Earth the
[20:27] Bible doesn't say that no did this
[20:30] before the flood but after the flood
[20:33] which I find unusual it's hard to
[20:35] believe that he didn't know something
[20:37] about this but yet what was it that
[20:40] drove him to this after the flood so he
[20:43] drank of the wine and was drunken and he
[20:46] was uncovered within his tent and ham
[20:51] the father of Canaan saw the nakedness
[20:56] of his father now Noah must have been
[20:58] pretty drunk like a lot of drunk people
[21:02] they do very foolish and stupid stuff
[21:06] depending on how drunk they are so
[21:08] there's something about people who get
[21:11] drunk when they get intoxicated that
[21:14] they're out of their mind and yet it can
[21:17] give them a Brazen boldness that they
[21:19] wouldn't have without it believe it or
[21:22] not I've prayed for many people over the
[21:25] years in church that were drinking I've
[21:28] had people come up to the Altar and
[21:30] their breath so strong on alcohol I
[21:34] would have to turn my face away from
[21:37] them as they were telling me what they
[21:40] wanted prayer for because they were so
[21:43] drunk and yet I know that some people
[21:45] whenever they get drunk they want to go
[21:47] to church which sounds crazy to us right
[21:51] you think in your mind why would they
[21:52] ever want to do that so it Alters those
[21:56] who do such and we can see now remember
[21:58] Noah was a prophet and the spirit of God
[22:01] had led him in this great thing that he
[22:04] had just accomplished and then
[22:06] afterwards he becomes a husbandman
[22:08] plants a Vineyard and then he drinks of
[22:11] it and what does Noah do of all the
[22:13] crazy things he drank of the wine and
[22:16] was drunken and he was uncovered within
[22:19] his tent and ham the father of kingan I
[22:23] remember he had three sons ham sham and
[22:26] and jpus and then notice how Moses when
[22:30] he goes to correlating this about ham
[22:34] and ham the father of Canaan saw the
[22:38] nakedness of his father so here ham
[22:42] comes near the tent door and he sees the
[22:46] condition of his daddy and he saw the
[22:49] nakedness of his father and told his two
[22:53] Brethren without and shim and japi took
[22:57] a garment now notice the difference
[22:59] between these two boys and laid it upon
[23:03] both their shoulders and went backward
[23:08] so they take a piece of a
[23:10] garment on one on one side one on the
[23:12] other and they wrap it around thems and
[23:15] they walk this way until they're near
[23:18] their father and then they drop the
[23:20] Garment back on their father to cover
[23:23] their father's nakedness now what caused
[23:26] this drinking it was not whiskey it was
[23:30] not rum it was not vodka it was nothing
[23:34] like people would drink today but it was
[23:37] from the vine straight from the vine in
[23:41] the liquor State now he must have drunk
[23:43] quite a bit of this because on average
[23:46] from the Old Testament to the New
[23:48] Testament wine only had between five to
[23:52] 7% alcohol so it was nothing like what
[23:56] people drink today so he would have had
[23:58] had to drunk a lot of it to get like
[24:01] this now notice so they walked backward
[24:04] and they dropped this on their father
[24:06] and their faces were backward and they
[24:08] saw not their father's nakedness now
[24:11] what a terrible thing for Noah to do and
[24:15] the mercy of God has just been extended
[24:16] to him and they come out of the flood
[24:19] and then Noah gets drunk and Noah awoke
[24:23] from his wine now remember not whiskey
[24:27] not vodka not any of this strong stuff
[24:29] today but just from wine and knew what
[24:33] his younger son had done unto him now
[24:37] this this verse 25 is a very strange and
[24:39] odd verse and he said cursed be
[24:44] Canaan why Canan never done
[24:49] this Canan wasn't even there do you
[24:53] understand the land that the children of
[24:55] Israel is going to inherit many many
[24:58] many centuries after this was called the
[25:01] land of Canaan it's named after Ham's
[25:06] son and Canaan wasn't even there he
[25:09] wasn't even the one that did that isn't
[25:12] it unusual that God would attribute now
[25:15] look how important it is what we do and
[25:19] how it can affect our children how it
[25:22] can be handed down from one generation
[25:25] to another and he said cursed be Canaan
[25:27] a servant of servants shall he be unto
[25:32] his Brethren so here is our first
[25:34] instance now in the Bible of someone
[25:38] drinking enough wine this stage of wine
[25:42] to become intoxicated it causes them to
[25:46] take off at least a portion of their
[25:48] clothes causes them to become in in a
[25:52] state that they should have never been
[25:54] in and look what it brought upon ham and
[25:58] what it also brought upon his son
[26:01] Canaan now also if you'd like to write
[26:04] this down and I'll have these up on the
[26:06] screen for you in Genesis 19:
[26:10] 30-38 lot was so drunk he did not know
[26:15] what he was doing and this led to his
[26:18] immorality with his two daughters this
[26:21] is after Lot's wife was killed and they
[26:24] thought all the Earth so they said had
[26:27] been destroyed and an hour ated and
[26:28] there ain't nobody to bring seed to our
[26:30] father so the oldest got her father
[26:33] drunk and and laid with him that night
[26:35] the younger got her father drunk the
[26:37] next night laid with him the next night
[26:39] and out of there comes the seed of Ammon
[26:42] and the seed of the moabites so again we
[26:46] find a man that was drinking now keep
[26:49] this in mind whenever we ask the
[26:52] question about Jesus turning water into
[26:56] wine watch the pattern that we want to
[26:58] lead up to this Leviticus 10: 9-11 God
[27:04] commanded the priest not to dram so that
[27:07] they could tell the difference between
[27:10] the holy and the
[27:12] Unholy so apparently drinking
[27:16] intoxicated drink Alters the Judgment of
[27:21] those who drink it so that they can no
[27:24] longer distinguish between the holy and
[27:27] the Unholy holy it does something to
[27:30] their senses okay now you all know I've
[27:33] never drunk in my life I've never drunk
[27:35] the only thing I've ever drunks
[27:36] communion wine and that's only a little
[27:39] tiny cup full so I don't know anything
[27:42] about it as far as my experience but
[27:45] I've dealt with enough people to know
[27:47] what it can do so God says for the
[27:50] priest not to drink it because it would
[27:53] affect their ability to discern between
[27:56] holy and Unholy Numbers Chapter
[27:58] 6:3 the nazarites were told to eat or
[28:03] drink nothing from the grape vine now
[28:08] think of that not to even eat from
[28:11] something from the grape vine now if you
[28:14] notice if you know this or not but the
[28:17] Bible neither the Old Testament or the
[28:19] new actually uses the words grape
[28:25] juice you will not find that in the
[28:27] Bible grape juice but God deals with
[28:32] vinegar from the grape and God also
[28:35] deals with the grape the that which
[28:38] comes forth from it but not the words
[28:41] grape juice now remember that grape
[28:44] juice Deuteronomy chap 21: 20 a drunken
[28:49] son was considered to be stubborn and
[28:52] rebellious Deuteronomy 29
[28:56] 5-6 God gave no grape juice which is the
[29:00] first stage of grape that was squeezed
[29:03] out to Israel nor did they have
[29:06] intoxicating drink in the wilderness now
[29:10] remember God's providing everything they
[29:13] need so if God felt like that it was
[29:16] okay to be able to give intoxicate and
[29:19] drink then God surely would have given
[29:22] it to the children of Israel because
[29:24] they were sad they were down they were
[29:26] depressed they were weary so if God was
[29:30] okay was getting a little bit of
[29:33] intoxication God should have just
[29:35] created a whole big bunch of it out
[29:37] there and let them drink it and when it
[29:39] would have made everybody feel better at
[29:41] least till in the morning and then of
[29:43] course they would had a major headache
[29:46] Deuteronomy
[29:48] 32:33 intoxicating wine is like the
[29:53] poison of
[29:55] serpents and the cruel Venom
[29:59] of asps now an asp was a poisonous
[30:03] snake now we're laying a big big
[30:06] foundation here this is what the Bible
[30:09] says that intoxicating wine is and what
[30:14] it will do judges 13:4 also verse 7 also
[30:20] verse 14 Samson was to be a Nazarite for
[30:24] Life his mother was not was told not to
[30:28] drink wine or strong drink now the Bible
[30:34] differentiates in this term of wine and
[30:39] strong drink so apparently in the Old
[30:43] Testament there was a wine which was not
[30:46] a strong
[30:48] drink or the Bible would not have said
[30:50] wine or strong drink so what was that
[30:56] wine which was not considered strong
[31:00] drink it's the same one Jesus
[31:04] made it was not
[31:08] fermented wine or strong drink I can see
[31:13] that some of you were shock Plum out of
[31:15] your shoes well that's okay just hold on
[31:17] we'll get them for you after the service
[31:18] is over 1st Samuel chap 25: 32 through
[31:23] 38 nabal died after a drunk spree 2
[31:29] Samuel
[31:30] 11:13 by getting UAH drunk David hoped
[31:35] to cover his sin now you see where I'm
[31:38] going with this look at the attributes
[31:42] of
[31:43] drunkenness now let me just spring the
[31:45] answer on you would our lord
[31:49] Jesus actually
[31:51] create
[31:54] 1880 gallons
[31:57] of
[32:00] wine now this is what it would have been
[32:03] with these containers containing two to
[32:06] three furens a piece and they were full
[32:10] of water what our lord Jesus created
[32:16] 1880 gallons of
[32:18] wine which would have
[32:21] intoxicated hundreds of people for many
[32:26] days
[32:28] and then knowing that all of these
[32:30] things right here could come from that
[32:34] creation can we honestly believe our
[32:38] lord Jesus would do such a
[32:42] thing well I think most of you got it we
[32:44] can probably move to the next question
[32:46] but I don't think I will I got a little
[32:48] bit more we want to look at now watch so
[32:52] Uriah getting
[32:54] drunk and David thinks by that his
[32:56] senses will be softened because this man
[32:59] really had some conviction said David
[33:01] said go go go lay with your wife no no
[33:03] no I can't do that no so what did David
[33:05] do he just kept giving him more drink
[33:07] more drink more drink but it didn't work
[33:11] because David knew what it was about
[33:13] intoxicating drink notice in 2 Samuel
[33:17] 13: 28 and 29 amnon was drunk when he
[33:22] was killed what a way to leave this
[33:24] world and meet God first Kings 20 verses
[33:28] 12- 21 benh Hadad and 32 other kings
[33:32] were drinking when they were attacked
[33:36] and defeated by the Israelites so what
[33:39] did intoxication do it
[33:43] desensitized their keenness to fight it
[33:47] desensitized their ability now know
[33:49] doubt these were professional men that
[33:52] knew how to war but why could not they
[33:55] fight well because the intoxication
[33:58] had desensitized everything about them
[34:01] they couldn't talk plain they couldn't
[34:03] walk right they could not think proper
[34:06] so there's no way they're going to be
[34:07] able to fight so get them drunk and
[34:11] you'll be able to kill
[34:13] them and the Lord Jesus would create
[34:17] this same
[34:18] thing and let this that he
[34:22] did be identified with him for over
[34:26] 2,000 years
[34:28] I really like the verse to that song you
[34:30] sung a while ago because it said water
[34:31] and
[34:33] wine I'm sure that it's been something
[34:35] that people for
[34:37] centuries actually for a couple of
[34:39] Millennia have wondered about and all
[34:42] many people have tried to take it and
[34:44] use it as a proof to say well Jesus
[34:47] turned the water into wine so you know
[34:49] it would be okay for us to be able to
[34:51] drink and it would be it's fine for you
[34:55] to drink the same kind he created
[35:00] created which was grape
[35:05] juice no one got
[35:07] intoxicated from drinking Jesus wine can
[35:11] you imagine him creating
[35:15] 180
[35:16] gallons of
[35:19] intoxication and telling everybody get
[35:22] drunk and have a great
[35:25] time in my name
[35:30] do this on me remember me remember my
[35:36] miraculous
[35:38] power when you get over your
[35:42] hangover no that's not what our lord
[35:45] Jesus done at
[35:48] all now watch this in Proverbs
[35:51] 4:17 alcoholic drink is called the wine
[35:56] of violence
[35:58] Proverbs 23: 19-20 a wise person will
[36:02] not be among the drinkers of alcoholic
[36:06] beverages Proverbs
[36:09] 23:21 drunkenness causes poverty now
[36:13] remember the Lord Jesus knew all of
[36:17] these
[36:18] verses so would he as God then come in
[36:22] the New Testament and create something
[36:25] which would break every one of these
[36:29] verses which we are looking at tonight
[36:31] then if he would what kind of
[36:35] God are we
[36:38] serving you understand everybody see
[36:41] where we're going with it Proverbs 23
[36:44] again 29 the 30 drinking calls is woe
[36:48] sorrow
[36:50] fighting
[36:51] babbling wounds without
[36:54] cause red eyes huh
[36:58] Proverbs 23:32 alcoholic drinks bite
[37:02] like a serpent sting like an
[37:05] Adder Proverbs 23:24 alcohol makes the
[37:09] Drinker unstable verse 35 alcohol makes
[37:13] the Drinker
[37:15] insensitive to
[37:17] pain so he does not perceive it as a
[37:22] warning alcohol is habit forming do you
[37:27] understand a if a person has so much
[37:28] alcohol in their blood it will keep them
[37:32] from freezing to
[37:34] death because it so stimulates the blood
[37:37] is that right brother Joe you know more
[37:38] about it than I would as far as the
[37:39] natural sense it will not allow them to
[37:42] freeze to death and and another person
[37:45] set up there without that alcohol and it
[37:47] would kill them look what it does oh my
[37:52] proverbs 31 veres 4 to 5 Kings princes
[37:56] and others who rule and judge must not
[38:00] drink alcohol alcohol perverts good
[38:04] judgment Proverbs 316 to7 strong drink
[38:09] could be given to those about to perish
[38:13] or those in
[38:16] pain but we have painkillers
[38:19] today so what would they do when people
[38:22] were in pain people on the battlefield
[38:25] and they had been stabbed in their fix
[38:27] them to die they got a sword running
[38:29] through their guts and they got big old
[38:31] You Know Places cut all over them and
[38:34] what would they do give them the
[38:36] alcohol to desensitize
[38:40] them and our lord Jesus created 180
[38:44] gallons of this
[38:47] stuff so people could have a big party
[38:50] in his
[38:51] name not my Lord Jesus Ecclesiastes 2:3
[38:58] the king tried everything King Solomon
[39:02] including intoxicating
[39:05] drink to see if it's
[39:07] satisfied and the end result was he said
[39:11] it did not in verse 8 Ecclesiastes
[39:15] 10:17 a land is blessed when its leaders
[39:21] do not drink Isaiah 5
[39:24] 11-12 woe to those who get up early to
[39:27] drink and stay up late at night to get
[39:32] drunk Isaiah 19:14 drunken men stagger
[39:36] in their
[39:38] vomit Jeremiah 35:
[39:42] 2-14 the rites drank no grape juice nor
[39:47] intoxicating
[39:49] wine and were blessed so the
[39:53] rites this was a sign of the blessing of
[39:57] God on them because they did not drink
[40:00] any of this and the Lord Jesus has got
[40:04] the
[40:05] disciples the apostles all standing
[40:07] around
[40:09] drunk the 70
[40:14] drunk if this was what the Lord Jesus
[40:17] did wonder why there's not one Speck of
[40:21] History which would have been written
[40:23] against him for doing such
[40:28] can you imagine they would have loved
[40:30] that if the Lord Jesus would have
[40:33] created intoxicating drink and the
[40:36] priest and the rabbis would have come
[40:38] and it would have went right down
[40:40] through history it would have been
[40:42] better by somebody just said you'd not
[40:45] believe it Jesus went there and created
[40:48] this wine and they had this big drunken
[40:51] party now remember unlike the way we do
[40:54] weddings today it was a minimum of seven
[41:01] days that the wedding celebration lasts
[41:04] totally different than what we do
[41:06] today if you were invited to the wedding
[41:11] celebration if they run out of wine
[41:15] those which were invited to your
[41:17] celebration could actually take you to
[41:21] court and sue you for
[41:25] it if you run out of food food to eat
[41:29] they could take you to court not only
[41:32] that it would be a witness against you
[41:36] for the rest of your married life you
[41:40] would be ridiculed made fun of and life
[41:43] that because you didn't have enough wine
[41:46] you didn't have enough mac and cheese
[41:49] you didn't have enough chicken nuggets
[41:51] I'm saying it on your terms now so the
[41:53] Lord Jesus knows all of this so this now
[41:58] Jesus didn't arrive the first day but it
[42:00] was just like two or three days in to
[42:02] the wedding and they were already out of
[42:05] why were they poor people who knows
[42:07] exactly what was going on so we have to
[42:09] get the setting to understand why would
[42:12] he even do this in the first place the
[42:16] Lord Jesus bailed out that young couple
[42:20] the way he's bailed out many of us now
[42:23] was it negligence on their part was it a
[42:25] lack of Finance we don't know exactly
[42:28] what it was he's bailing out the
[42:31] reputation so why would you bail out the
[42:34] reputation of a young man and a young
[42:37] woman and you're going to ruin your own
[42:41] by making intoxicating drink and it be
[42:44] used against you for 2,000
[42:48] years praise the
[42:50] Lord ain't the word of God so wonderful
[42:53] oh praise the Lord now notice in Daniel
[42:57] chap 1: 5-17 it just condensed this and
[43:01] you can write it down and read it when
[43:02] you have time Daniel refused the king's
[43:07] intoxicating wine and was blessed for it
[43:11] along with his abstaining friends Daniel
[43:16] 5:4 drinking wine was combined with
[43:21] praising false
[43:24] gods Hosea 4:11 in intoxicating wine
[43:29] takes away
[43:32] intelligence Joel 3:3 the enemy is
[43:37] judged for selling girls for
[43:42] wine can you imagine a father selling
[43:46] his daughter for
[43:48] wine selling your daughter for whyne why
[43:53] because this was an
[43:55] alcoholic you understand in the
[43:57] Victorian times they didn't have Ajax
[44:01] they didn't have bleach and many of the
[44:03] stuff that we have today anybody here
[44:06] know what they mopped their floors in
[44:09] anybody a mixture of beer and
[44:14] water the yeast in the
[44:17] beer was a cleansing
[44:20] agent so they would mix it together and
[44:23] it would actually clean their
[44:25] floors but do you understand that some
[44:28] of the alcoholics that was in such a bad
[44:31] shape they would go and stand outside
[44:34] and wait for the maids to pour out the
[44:37] mop
[44:39] water so there's cow manure there's
[44:42] everything imaginable inside that mop
[44:46] water but it had a little bit of
[44:50] alcohol in that mop water and they would
[44:53] stand outside cow manure chicken manure
[44:57] everything else all the
[44:59] filth and the Lord Jesus would create
[45:02] that for people to become intoxicated
[45:06] and addicted to not my Lord now my Lord
[45:10] creates wine absolutely and as a matter
[45:14] of fact I love to get drunk on that wine
[45:18] which is allowed for Sons and Daughters
[45:20] of God but it's stimulation by
[45:24] Revelation and oh yeah you do get
[45:26] addicted because once you ever get it
[45:28] it's like you can never get enough you
[45:30] want more but you won't sell your girls
[45:33] to get it you won't make you beat your
[45:35] wife and you won't lose your
[45:37] intelligence you won't become you know
[45:39] like a lot of drunks do but you come so
[45:42] in love with the Lord Jesus and so in
[45:44] love with other people people will know
[45:46] that you're pass from Death unto life
[45:49] praise the Lord notice habac chap 2
[45:52] verse 5 a man is betrayed by wine verse
[45:57] 16 drinking leads to shame Matthew 24:
[46:03] 48-51 a drinking servant is
[46:07] unprepared for his
[46:10] Lord's return so how then could Jesus
[46:13] then early there in the first couple of
[46:15] chapters of John create an
[46:18] intoxicating 180
[46:21] gallons of wine and then use wine as a
[46:26] parable in this servants getting drunk
[46:30] and say whenever they say our Lord
[46:32] delays his coming and they begin to eat
[46:34] and drink and they beat the servants
[46:36] which is what happens when you get drunk
[46:39] our Lord would create that very
[46:41] substance and use it in a parabolic form
[46:44] and say now if you all do this this will
[46:47] make you miss the coming of the lord
[46:49] well how could he create something that
[46:51] would make them do it and then turn
[46:54] around around and say oh yeah if y'all
[46:55] drink this you won't be ready for my
[46:58] coming are you young people
[47:00] understanding where I'm coming from
[47:03] tonight oh my Luke 1 verse1
[47:07] 15 John the Baptist drank neither grape
[47:11] juice nor one Romans
[47:14] 13:13 do not walk in drunkenness or
[47:19] immorality 1 Corinthians 511 if a
[47:22] Christian brother is a drinker do not
[47:26] associate
[47:27] with
[47:29] him Wow have no company with
[47:33] him 1 Corinthians 6:10 drunkards will
[47:38] not
[47:39] inherit the kingdom of God Galatians
[47:43] 5:21 acts of the sinful nature such as
[47:46] drunkenness will prohibit a person from
[47:50] inheriting the kingdom of God now let
[47:52] read Numbers Chapter
[47:54] 6:2 speak unto the children of is Isel
[47:57] and say unto them when either man or
[48:00] woman shall separate
[48:02] themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite to
[48:07] separate themselves unto the Lord he
[48:10] shall separate himself from wine now
[48:14] notice how Moses differentiates between
[48:19] wine and strong
[48:23] drink now remember the word grape juice
[48:27] is not in the
[48:28] Bible but this wine here was actually
[48:33] grape juice first
[48:35] stage now they did not have the ability
[48:39] that we do today to be able to keep
[48:41] grape juice the only thing they could do
[48:44] was boil it and gigantic
[48:47] Vats it would then turn into a jelly
[48:52] type of form which would endure its life
[48:55] a little bit it was more of a
[48:58] concentrate but they didn't have the
[49:00] ability to go down to Food City or
[49:02] Kroger wherever and buy 100% grape juice
[49:05] they had no way to be able to do it so
[49:08] the first thing that they would do then
[49:10] whenever they would it out in
[49:12] their feet and and they would it
[49:14] and then they would take it and they
[49:16] would begin to use it before the natural
[49:20] process would go to being used so notice
[49:23] how the Bible then separates it he shall
[49:25] separate himself from from wine and
[49:28] strong drink and shall drink no
[49:32] vinegar of wine or
[49:36] vinegar of strong
[49:39] drink neither shall he drink any
[49:43] liquor of
[49:45] grapes nor eat moist
[49:49] grapes or dried now the word which we
[49:53] render vinegar shets
[49:57] signifies
[49:58] fermentation and might have been so
[50:01] rendered so sh drink no strong
[50:05] fermentation of wine notice again
[50:08] numbers
[50:09] 287 and the drink offering thereof shall
[50:12] be the fourth part of an hen for the one
[50:14] lamb in the Holy Place Thou shalt cause
[50:18] the strong
[50:21] wine to be poured out unto the Lord for
[50:25] a drink offering now notice how the
[50:27] Bible differentiates now strong wine
[50:31] what was it strong it was because it had
[50:34] Now set and fermented and it's moved
[50:38] over into this alcoholic state but
[50:42] remember even at that no more than 5 to
[50:45] 7% alcohol look at Samson's mother
[50:48] judges 13:4 now therefore beware I pray
[50:52] thee and drink not wine
[50:56] nor strong drink not
[51:01] wine what is this it's what we would
[51:04] call today grape juice and eat not any
[51:07] unclean thing Proverbs 20 And1 wine is a
[51:13] mocker to scorn make mouths at talk
[51:19] arrogantly to boast to mock derived to
[51:24] be inflated
[51:26] scoff act as a scorner show oneself as a
[51:30] marcker sounds like a drunk man to me
[51:34] wine is a marcker strong drink is Raging
[51:39] so wine is a marcker in that it
[51:43] deceives by its fragrance and
[51:48] intoxicates by its
[51:50] strength so it deceives by its fragrance
[51:55] and then to a person they begin to smell
[51:58] it oh it just does something to him it
[52:00] doesn't it doesn't intoxicate by the
[52:03] fragrance but it deceives by the
[52:06] fragrance and
[52:08] intoxicates by its strengths and renders
[52:12] the
[52:13] intoxicated
[52:15] ridiculous absolutely
[52:17] ridiculous and then Solomon the great
[52:21] writer of Proverbs says that strong
[52:23] drink is a raging and whosoever is
[52:27] deceived thereby is not wise so the word
[52:29] raging is to
[52:31] murmur
[52:33] growl Roar cry
[52:37] aloud mourn rage make
[52:42] noise yeah sounds like a drunk to
[52:45] me TL be clamorous be disqui be loud be
[52:51] troubled be an uproar be in a stir be it
[52:54] a commotion to be borous to be
[52:57] turbulent and the Lord Jesus created 180
[53:02] gallons of
[53:05] this no my brother sister he did
[53:08] not now nothing is mentioned here if
[53:11] you'll notice about excess
[53:15] drinking it's
[53:17] drinking
[53:20] altoe oh but brother Donnie it's okay
[53:23] right if we drink in
[53:25] moderation actually
[53:27] it's not it's drinking
[53:30] itself that is
[53:33] condemned well praise the lord it's the
[53:37] very nature of
[53:39] alcohol that grabs a hold of people now
[53:43] you take my word for this and I protect
[53:46] the identity of course as always of many
[53:51] that I've dealt with down through the
[53:54] years and I've dealt with not not just
[53:56] people who drink there's a difference
[53:59] between somebody who just
[54:01] drinks and an
[54:03] alcoholic they will sell their soul so
[54:07] to speak to have it they'll do whatever
[54:10] they've got to do they'll take their
[54:12] baby's milk money they'll do whatever
[54:15] they have to do to have it Proverbs
[54:19] 23:29 who has woe who hath sorrow who ha
[54:24] contentions who has babbling who has
[54:27] wounds without cause who has redness of
[54:31] eyes that they T long at the
[54:35] wine that they go to
[54:38] seek mixed wine look not upon the wine
[54:45] when it is red watch it
[54:47] now it's changing from the deep color of
[54:51] purple it's becoming
[54:54] fermented it's changing ing from the
[54:57] grape juice
[54:58] color to the
[55:01] red to the
[55:04] red look not upon the wine when it is
[55:07] red when it giveth his color in the cup
[55:12] when it
[55:13] moves itself what's happening the
[55:17] fermentation of it changing the
[55:20] color and the person that's aware of it
[55:24] he knows what the color
[55:29] represents listen this is a man
[55:32] apparently that had drunk it before at
[55:35] the last it bite us like a serpent and
[55:41] sting us like an
[55:43] Adder Thine Eyes Shall Behold strange
[55:49] women thine heart shall utter perverse
[55:52] things now you mean intoxication
[55:56] will cause even a married
[55:59] man to look at a somebody else's wife or
[56:04] you know some woman at a bar and will
[56:08] stir up his lust and his
[56:13] passions and the Lord Jesus created 180
[56:16] gallons of
[56:18] this so the people could all go around
[56:21] drinking and make them look at somebody
[56:24] else's wife and want to take their wife
[56:28] or their husband yall don't believe that
[56:31] do you how could our lord Jesus break
[56:35] all of these
[56:38] scriptures praise the
[56:41] Lord he could not could he brother Joel
[56:44] he could
[56:46] not Thine Eyes Shall Behold strange
[56:49] women thine heart shall utter perverse
[56:53] things now notice he says
[56:56] yay Thou shalt be as that that liest
[56:59] down to the midst of the sea or he that
[57:02] liest down on the top of a mast look at
[57:05] a drunk man he's lying down like he's in
[57:08] the middle of the sea or on top of the
[57:10] Mast anybody in the right mind ain't
[57:12] going to lay down on the top of a mast
[57:14] you know what a mast is right it's the
[57:17] big pole in the ship by which they would
[57:19] pull up the sail it's about that big
[57:22] around at the top you're going to lay
[57:24] down on top of that if you're a drunk
[57:26] you will why because your senses are so
[57:30] changed they're so changed you can't
[57:34] perceive things any longer verse 35 they
[57:38] have stricken me shalt thou say and I
[57:40] was not sick they have beaten me and I
[57:42] felt it
[57:44] not this is what it does when you get so
[57:47] drunk they can hit you and beat you and
[57:49] kick you and stomp you oh I don't even
[57:53] care I don't even care
[57:58] and Jesus made
[58:00] this so all these people could
[58:03] experience
[58:04] that no he did
[58:07] not my my now notice what they will do
[58:12] though this is the terrible thing about
[58:14] it they have beaten me and I felt it not
[58:17] when shall I
[58:18] wake when shall
[58:22] iwake I will seek it yet
[58:28] again so they'll go through all that
[58:31] utter complete
[58:33] nonsense that I just read you from one
[58:36] verse after another after another and
[58:38] when they wake up they say I got to do
[58:42] it
[58:44] again I have to do it again I have to
[58:47] have
[58:51] it oh
[58:53] my now let me just read you a few words
[58:57] from historians PL anybody ever heard of
[59:01] him plany Roman historian plyy said good
[59:09] wine is
[59:11] destitute of
[59:13] spirit in other words it isn't alcoholic
[59:19] now plany was not a holy ghost filled
[59:22] Apostolic
[59:24] preacher he was a wine drinking Roman
[59:30] historian and this Roman historian said
[59:34] good wine is destitute of spirit so some
[59:38] of you may be wondering tonight but wait
[59:39] a minute brother Donnie that man at the
[59:41] feast got up and said most people drink
[59:44] the bad you know they bring the good
[59:46] wine and then whenever people the wine
[59:48] is going on and going out then they
[59:50] bring the bad stuff but you've saved the
[59:52] good until last and you're you're
[59:56] thinking in your mind well the good
[59:57] stuff must have been the most potent
[1:00:00] stuff that ain't what plyy
[1:00:03] said plyy said the good stuff is without
[1:00:07] the spirit the alcohol
[1:00:10] intoxication he also said wine with the
[1:00:14] strength reduced by the filter was the
[1:00:18] most suitable for all men you know what
[1:00:22] they would do mix it with water
[1:00:26] Aristotle any y'all ever heard of
[1:00:28] Aristotle Aristotle said the good wine
[1:00:33] does not not
[1:00:35] intoxicate well I normally don't amen
[1:00:38] Aristotle but I'm going to amen him
[1:00:42] here now listen friends so there's a
[1:00:45] continuity that runs even with history
[1:00:47] so these men now they rub shoulders with
[1:00:50] the upper echelon of their
[1:00:53] day you imagine them saying such a thing
[1:00:56] it's outdated of course in oldfashioned
[1:00:58] in this day but that's what these men
[1:01:01] come up with it wonder where they got
[1:01:03] this idea being around all them drunk
[1:01:07] rulers and all them drunk
[1:01:11] leaders Solomon went on to say in
[1:01:13] Proverbs 31:4 it is not for Kings Oly
[1:01:18] mule it is not for Kings to drink
[1:01:22] wine nor princes
[1:01:26] strong
[1:01:27] drink notice the differentiation again
[1:01:30] between wine and strong drink verse five
[1:01:34] lest they drink and forget the
[1:01:39] law oh so this is what drinking will do
[1:01:42] huh and pervert the
[1:01:45] Judgment of any of The Afflicted Isaiah
[1:01:50] 287 but they also have aired through
[1:01:54] wine and through true strong drink the
[1:01:58] scripture over and over again now the
[1:02:00] word strong there an intoxicating
[1:02:04] beverage different from wine it was a
[1:02:08] fictitious product made of a mixture of
[1:02:12] sweet ingredients whether derived from
[1:02:15] grain and vegetables or from the juice
[1:02:18] of fruits dates and a
[1:02:21] decoation of
[1:02:24] Honey wow so the Bible actually
[1:02:28] differentiated between wine and strong
[1:02:30] drink are out of the way the priest and
[1:02:33] the prophet have aired through strong
[1:02:35] drink they are swallowed up of wine they
[1:02:38] are out of the way through strong drink
[1:02:40] they air in Vision they stumble in
[1:02:43] judgment why because they were drinking
[1:02:46] intoxicating drink habac 2:15
[1:02:52] whoa now listen this carefully
[1:02:58] woe unto
[1:03:00] him that
[1:03:03] giveth his
[1:03:05] neighbor
[1:03:08] drink so if the Lord Jesus
[1:03:12] created intoxicating
[1:03:15] drink the Old Testament put a
[1:03:21] woe on the Lord Jesus
[1:03:27] so that means your
[1:03:30] lamb the atonement for your
[1:03:33] sins had a woe placed upon him which
[1:03:38] means he was not sinless after
[1:03:45] all you see this is one thing I love
[1:03:47] about question and
[1:03:49] answers cu the lord loves to get the
[1:03:52] devil into such a tight spot a squeal
[1:03:56] like a pig I mean I love hearing that
[1:03:59] Devil's
[1:04:01] [Laughter]
[1:04:03] squal Hallelujah woe unto him that
[1:04:07] giveth his neighbor
[1:04:09] drink so Jesus
[1:04:13] provides 180
[1:04:19] gallons of this
[1:04:22] no that put us thy bottle to him and
[1:04:26] makest him drunken
[1:04:30] also that thou mayest
[1:04:33] look on their
[1:04:37] nakedness so you
[1:04:39] imagine these days if the Lord Jesus
[1:04:42] made it 50 proof 90 100 which is the way
[1:04:47] some Christians read this the best was
[1:04:50] saved to the last which in their mind
[1:04:52] thinks the most intoxicating power the
[1:04:54] most generative think that because they
[1:04:56] want to drink or they're already doing
[1:04:57] it on the side
[1:04:59] already but the best wine it must have
[1:05:03] been so
[1:05:05] flavorful it must have just been
[1:05:07] awesome because the man that was in
[1:05:10] charge of the feast he come back and
[1:05:11] said I ain't never tasted none of this
[1:05:13] in my life well of course he ain't all
[1:05:16] the rest of the wine he drunk was made
[1:05:18] by by man this was made by God
[1:05:22] himself so it wasn't intoxicating but
[1:05:25] the Aroma and the flavor and and the
[1:05:28] color it must have been absolutely
[1:05:31] awesome I'd like to have some of it
[1:05:33] right
[1:05:35] now you say oh Lord Brother do not you
[1:05:40] yes I drink
[1:05:43] ale ginger
[1:05:47] ale I drink
[1:05:49] beer A and W zero sugar root beer
[1:05:56] isn't it amazing
[1:05:58] though some of you go out I say mama
[1:06:01] brother Donnie said he dranks beer tell
[1:06:04] them the rest of what I said but it
[1:06:07] amazing somebody that would want to say
[1:06:09] oh goodness I heard the preacher say
[1:06:11] drunk beer and it's the same word but
[1:06:14] it's not the same stuff but in our mind
[1:06:17] under Western Civilization when we think
[1:06:20] wine we think like our modern day we're
[1:06:23] not reading it right in the setting of
[1:06:27] the scripture can anybody say amen amen
[1:06:31] woe unto him that giveth his neighbor
[1:06:33] drink that put us a bottle to him and
[1:06:36] maketh him drunken also that thou mayest
[1:06:39] look on their nakedness so the word wine
[1:06:44] in the Bible is used to actually
[1:06:48] describe the wine with
[1:06:51] alcohol and the wine
[1:06:54] without very same Hebrew word now grape
[1:06:58] juice what we call grape juice today is
[1:07:02] sometimes referred to in the Bible as
[1:07:05] new wine Isaiah
[1:07:07] 658 thus sayeth the Lord as the new wine
[1:07:11] is found in the
[1:07:14] cluster notice now it's not set in the
[1:07:17] vat for weeks and weeks and weeks our
[1:07:21] communion wine that we use speaking of
[1:07:24] that we need to take communion again
[1:07:25] don't we how he agrees with
[1:07:27] that brother JD Woodson makes that for
[1:07:31] us I don't know exactly the process if
[1:07:34] you would like to ask him you can I'm
[1:07:35] sure but he makes that for us and it's a
[1:07:39] process of being able to allow it to do
[1:07:42] whatever it is that it does but notice
[1:07:45] how the writer Isaiah here he says as
[1:07:47] the new wine is found in the cluster not
[1:07:50] the vat not the container which it's set
[1:07:54] in and fermentation
[1:07:56] but the new wine is actually in the
[1:07:59] cluster and one saith destroy it not for
[1:08:02] a blessing is in it so will I do for my
[1:08:04] servant's sake so God here is likening
[1:08:07] the new wine which is the grape juice to
[1:08:09] the blessing of the Lord Matthew 9:17
[1:08:12] neither do men put new wine into Old
[1:08:16] bottles so they would not take fresh
[1:08:19] grape juice and put it into the bottles
[1:08:22] remember they didn't have glass at that
[1:08:23] time but they use animal skin so the
[1:08:25] animal skins the oil out of the animal
[1:08:28] skin was dried out so if they put new
[1:08:30] wine in there then it will start
[1:08:32] activating and it will cause the animal
[1:08:35] skin to burst wide open and you lose the
[1:08:38] skin and also the wine so Jesus himself
[1:08:41] uses this word new wine now let's look
[1:08:44] at St John Chapter 2 where Jesus turned
[1:08:48] the water into wine in the third day
[1:08:52] there was a marriage in canaa of Galilee
[1:08:55] never remember remember Jesus shows up
[1:08:57] on day three so they've got at least day
[1:09:01] three on through day seven five more
[1:09:04] days of
[1:09:06] festivities and Jesus comes on the third
[1:09:09] day on the third day there was a
[1:09:10] marriage in Cana of galileon and the
[1:09:12] mother of Jesus was there both Jesus was
[1:09:14] called and his disciples to the marriage
[1:09:17] and when they wanted wine the mother of
[1:09:19] Jesus said unto him they have no
[1:09:23] wine not to us we're thinking so what
[1:09:26] what's the big deal well they didn't
[1:09:29] have punch and they didn't have Coke
[1:09:30] Zero poor things and they they didn't
[1:09:33] have zero sugar A&W Root Beer and they
[1:09:36] didn't have all the stuff whatever it is
[1:09:38] that you like to drink and these young
[1:09:41] people's
[1:09:42] reputation is going to be ly you talking
[1:09:45] about
[1:09:47] embarrassing so
[1:09:49] notice Jesus saith unto Heroman
[1:09:55] wow
[1:09:57] woman what have I to do with
[1:10:01] thee mine
[1:10:03] hour is not yet
[1:10:06] come his mother saith unto the
[1:10:09] servants whatsoever he saith unto
[1:10:13] you do
[1:10:15] it now that's quite a rebuke in one way
[1:10:17] right so you think we said well sure Mom
[1:10:19] I mean whatever you want mom is exactly
[1:10:21] what I do he don't even call her mother
[1:10:23] but he calls her woman
[1:10:25] mine hour is not yet
[1:10:28] come but somehow she must have believed
[1:10:32] I know him well enough to know he's
[1:10:35] going to do something for this young
[1:10:37] couple oh I'm so glad he's done
[1:10:39] something for us to bail me out my
[1:10:42] goodness how many times has he bail me
[1:10:45] out of some of the craziest stuff ever
[1:10:46] was anybody know what I'm talking about
[1:10:48] when you get yourself in a fix and Jesus
[1:10:51] comes on the
[1:10:52] scene notice and they're set six water
[1:10:56] parts of stone after the manner of
[1:11:00] purifying of the Jews containing two or
[1:11:03] three furens a
[1:11:06] piece Jesus saith unto them fill the
[1:11:09] water pots with
[1:11:12] water and they fill them up to the brim
[1:11:17] and he saith unto them draw out now and
[1:11:20] bear unto the governor of the feast and
[1:11:23] they bear it and when the RO ruler of
[1:11:26] the feast had tasted the water which was
[1:11:30] made wine and knew not whence it was but
[1:11:34] the servants which drew the water knew
[1:11:38] the governor of the feast called the
[1:11:39] bridegroom and sath unto him every man
[1:11:42] at the beginning just set forth the good
[1:11:46] wine now let's look at this Greek
[1:11:49] word
[1:11:51] onos this word was used to describe both
[1:11:55] wine
[1:11:57] with and
[1:11:59] without
[1:12:02] alcohol so how are we going to be able
[1:12:05] to know which one Jesus
[1:12:11] created we will judge the works of our
[1:12:15] Lord
[1:12:16] Jesus by How It lines
[1:12:19] up with his
[1:12:22] word now if you'll learn this tonight
[1:12:25] it'll help you the rest of your entire
[1:12:28] life a lot of people blame Jesus for a
[1:12:32] lot of stuff he don't do and they feel
[1:12:36] led to do this and feel led to do that
[1:12:38] and feel led to do something
[1:12:41] else and whenever you hear people tell
[1:12:44] why I feel led to do this and I feel led
[1:12:47] to do that and I feel led to do
[1:12:48] something else and yet you know the
[1:12:51] scripture you know the teaching of the
[1:12:52] word of the IR you say how in the world
[1:12:54] could that be because that's contrary to
[1:12:56] the Bible That's contrary to the word
[1:12:59] well what are you doing you're doing the
[1:13:01] very same thing I'm doing right here
[1:13:03] tonight you're judging what they say
[1:13:06] they feel led to do but what you know
[1:13:09] the word teaches now we've done look at
[1:13:11] what the word says about wine strong
[1:13:14] drink drunkenness right woe unto the man
[1:13:19] that will give his neighbor drink so you
[1:13:21] see I don't want you to be convinced
[1:13:24] when you leave here tonight tonight well
[1:13:25] brother Donnie said brother Donnie said
[1:13:28] Jesus wouldn't have done that I want you
[1:13:31] to be able to walk out them doors right
[1:13:33] there and if anybody ask you you can be
[1:13:36] able to judge it maybe you couldn't do
[1:13:39] it before this night's service but I
[1:13:41] want you after this night's service to
[1:13:43] be able to say I know my lord well
[1:13:46] enough to know he would have never
[1:13:48] broken all them Old Testament
[1:13:52] scriptures and place a woe upon
[1:13:57] himself and give them intoxicating
[1:14:02] drink so which application then of on
[1:14:06] onos was this that our Lord created now
[1:14:10] watch so alcohol content in the wine in
[1:14:14] the New Testament run from 5 to
[1:14:17] 7% now this is a little bit of history
[1:14:19] for you so it was a common practice to
[1:14:22] dilute the fermented wine at a
[1:14:26] ratio of three to one and sometimes up
[1:14:32] to 20 to one depending on how strong it
[1:14:37] was this was done to keep them from
[1:14:41] getting
[1:14:42] drunk and also to purify their
[1:14:48] water now listen carefully now remember
[1:14:51] they did not have Culligan water water
[1:14:56] they did not have Elizabethan water
[1:14:58] Johnson City Water they did not have all
[1:15:02] the ways that we have to treat water now
[1:15:06] I've traveled in different nations of
[1:15:07] the world and I know some of you here
[1:15:09] have as
[1:15:10] well and whenever I go I try to check
[1:15:14] out if I'm not familiar with it I try to
[1:15:17] go to our government's website and see
[1:15:20] if they recommend drinking the water
[1:15:24] there has anybody here ever brushed your
[1:15:26] teeth in
[1:15:29] cocacola I'm not joking you have you
[1:15:32] ever brush your teeth in Fanta orange
[1:15:37] you talking about a real
[1:15:39] treat now the reason I've have done that
[1:15:42] before is because their water would make
[1:15:45] me sick believe me I've got sick before
[1:15:50] I thought I was going to die Carolyn I
[1:15:54] was an a eting in Kenya several years
[1:15:56] ago there was we was preaching to about
[1:16:00] 5,000 service in under a large gigantic
[1:16:04] tent there was brothers that came from
[1:16:07] Zimbabwe staying in the same hotel that
[1:16:10] Carol and Iber staying with brother
[1:16:11] Barry coffee and some other ministers
[1:16:13] from the states and we were all staying
[1:16:15] at the same hotel and they would have a
[1:16:17] buffet type thing where you'd go eat
[1:16:19] well they had lettuce they had tomatoes
[1:16:22] they had you know some really good
[1:16:24] looking stuff
[1:16:25] but I had done learned you don't eat
[1:16:28] that stuff cuz it's washed in their
[1:16:32] water but these were Africans from
[1:16:37] Zimbabwe but they were coming to eat
[1:16:40] from water that was not the Bugs they
[1:16:45] were used to so every one of those
[1:16:48] people from Zimbabwe got so sick laid up
[1:16:53] in the hotel they kind of laughed at us
[1:16:56] because we didn't you know eat anything
[1:16:59] that wasn't cooked I wouldn't going to
[1:17:01] do it i' done been sick before I didn't
[1:17:02] want to be sick again so they o eyes
[1:17:05] fine it's great brother huh did they
[1:17:08] learn themsel a lesson now keep in
[1:17:11] mind they would actually use the wine
[1:17:16] and dilute it down and pour it in their
[1:17:21] water to kill the bacteria and the germs
[1:17:26] in the
[1:17:28] water
[1:17:30] wow so you mean when Paul told
[1:17:34] Timothy drink a little
[1:17:38] wine for your stomach sake boy there
[1:17:41] must be a lot more people with stomach
[1:17:43] trouble than what I realized in the
[1:17:45] world man because that's what a lot of
[1:17:49] people you know so-called Christians
[1:17:50] they love to use that scripture when my
[1:17:53] belly is hurting my Bell's H yeah it's
[1:17:57] your head it ain't your
[1:18:00] belly they don't even apply that
[1:18:02] scripture don't you understand what Paul
[1:18:04] was telling
[1:18:06] Timothy the very same application
[1:18:09] applied now watch 1 Timothy 5:23 drink
[1:18:14] no longer water but
[1:18:18] use
[1:18:19] a use a
[1:18:23] little wine for thy stomach sake and
[1:18:27] thine often infirmities now the
[1:18:31] conditions where they
[1:18:32] were the water was so bad Timothy kept
[1:18:37] having reoccurring stomach issues now
[1:18:41] this young man was such a sensitive
[1:18:44] individual I love this guy I can't wait
[1:18:47] to see him he was so sensitive about
[1:18:50] doing right and that I mean he was just
[1:18:53] had a conscience that must have just
[1:18:55] been so pure that Paul actually had to
[1:18:59] encourage him buddy it's it's all right
[1:19:02] for you to take a little bit of it and
[1:19:05] just kill all this stuff in your water
[1:19:08] he said you know Timothy I don't have to
[1:19:10] worry about you getting drunk I have a
[1:19:12] hard enough time getting you to take a
[1:19:14] tablespoon of it just to disinfect your
[1:19:17] water you're talking about a sensitive
[1:19:19] oh I like these type of Christians right
[1:19:21] here that they're just so sensitive
[1:19:23] before the Lord they're not looking to
[1:19:25] see how close they can get well brother
[1:19:27] Donnie how much wine is a little how
[1:19:29] much can I get by with a half a gallon
[1:19:32] if I take a half a gallon then how much
[1:19:34] water do I dilute it with do I delete a
[1:19:37] a bottle water and then I take a half a
[1:19:40] gallon of water no you've got the ratio
[1:19:42] the wrong
[1:19:43] way it's three parts water one part wine
[1:19:48] up to 20 Parts water of one part wine
[1:19:51] but remember they're not drinking this
[1:19:54] for pleasure meure they're not sitting
[1:19:57] around in a social drink and they're not
[1:19:59] having a glass of wine with the
[1:20:05] steak I think I might climb up on the
[1:20:08] platform and finish the
[1:20:12] rest oh
[1:20:14] my so you see it was being mixed for
[1:20:19] what reason
[1:20:23] medicinal medicinal
[1:20:25] had nothing to do with
[1:20:27] pleasure had nothing to do with some
[1:20:29] water as far as saying well you know I I
[1:20:31] just think I'd rather drink a little bit
[1:20:33] I I'm going drink a little bit with my
[1:20:35] boss and I'm going to go out tonight
[1:20:37] with the supper you know that we've got
[1:20:38] planned and no that's not what he was
[1:20:40] even talking about but for his stomach
[1:20:45] sake oh God oh God my stomach's cramping
[1:20:48] me I'm going to stop by the liquor store
[1:20:49] and get me a bottle of
[1:20:51] wine you hypocrite
[1:20:56] I said you're a
[1:20:58] hypocrite well Paul told Timothy but he
[1:21:00] told him to take a little so let me ask

[1:23:08] little bit before I come
[1:23:11] out the anointing is a strange
[1:23:14] thing I walked out got under the
[1:23:16] presence of the Lord about, 1500 people
[1:23:20] there sister hope matate was there it
[1:23:21] was a young
[1:23:23] lady that was her home
[1:23:25] church then people pulled I moved under
[1:23:29] the anointing in just a little bit I did
[1:23:31] not have one ache I did not have one
[1:23:34] pain I was so weak I had to stand up on
[1:23:38] the pull pit but when the anointing hit
[1:23:40] me my strengths come I felt like I was a
[1:23:43] horor wi I preached for about an hour
[1:23:46] and 15 minutes or something like that on
[1:23:48] a drink for the king them Africans I'm
[1:23:52] telling you what they pull me me the
[1:23:54] presence of God was so
[1:23:57] awesome I thought praise the Lord I'm
[1:24:02] Healed when the anointing left me they
[1:24:05] had to Pat me back to the
[1:24:08] room strange is
[1:24:12] it we was leaving the next night for
[1:24:14] Frankfurt German I couldn't
[1:24:16] eat I got home my eyes changed colors
[1:24:21] that changed about the color of Mason's
[1:24:24] sh shirt
[1:24:25] orange it took me weeks and weeks to get
[1:24:29] over it why something in the
[1:24:35] water now this is where we apply it now
[1:24:39] so whenever we take our
[1:24:42] medicine my doctor told me several years
[1:24:45] after that I said you got an advice for
[1:24:48] me Doc I'm going over to Africa he said
[1:24:50] y' take some Pepto
[1:24:52] bismo about two days days before you
[1:24:56] leave take it a couple times during the
[1:24:58] day and he said it will be a protective
[1:25:02] coating it will go down your intestines
[1:25:04] down into your stomach and it will make
[1:25:07] them little bacteria where they won't
[1:25:09] stick to the wall of your
[1:25:14] intestines well I not only took it I
[1:25:17] took it with
[1:25:18] me just in case I needed
[1:25:22] it so how how much of a medication do we
[1:25:28] take so if we're taking
[1:25:32] medication cough syrup something this
[1:25:35] liquid
[1:25:37] teaspoon
[1:25:39] tablespoon any y'all ever took a quart
[1:25:43] of medication at one
[1:25:48] time praise the Lord now if we're going
[1:25:52] to take this wine listen taken in
[1:25:55] comparison for the
[1:25:57] medicinal comparability of
[1:26:00] it praise the
[1:26:02] Lord so a
[1:26:05] glass and say it's for my stomach that
[1:26:08] ain't for your stomach it's that devil
[1:26:11] you got in
[1:26:13] [Laughter]
[1:26:18] you so if we're doing it for medicine
[1:26:22] let's stick by the little
[1:26:25] dose just a little bit of trivia if you
[1:26:28] want to call it that way there's
[1:26:30] something else here that we need to look
[1:26:31] at two
[1:26:34] tablespoons of 86 proof brandy or
[1:26:38] whiskey can raise the blood alcohol
[1:26:41] level to
[1:26:45] 0.04
[1:26:46] almost
[1:26:49] immediately how
[1:26:52] much two
[1:26:55] tablespoons one tablespoon of Jin vodka
[1:27:00] rum and some whiskies can raise the
[1:27:03] blood alcohol level to reach
[1:27:07] 0.05 six tablespoons about 1/3 cup a
[1:27:11] modern fortified wine causes blood level
[1:27:15] of
[1:27:17] 0.04 to
[1:27:19] 0.05 in Paul's day it would require
[1:27:22] drinking approximately one
[1:27:27] gallon of 3 to six proof fermented grape
[1:27:31] juice within an
[1:27:33] hour to attain a
[1:27:37] 0.03 blood level
[1:27:39] alcohol boy that would be quite a feat
[1:27:42] for a pro a person that's already having
[1:27:44] stomach trouble wouldn't it I mean you
[1:27:46] walk out like
[1:27:51] there what you doing taking my
[1:27:53] medication
[1:28:00] shut what life in a make
[1:28:03] AR you get me
[1:28:07] tickles so the word denounces a person
[1:28:10] that does that as a marker now young
[1:28:13] people quit laughing I looked my head
[1:28:16] down like
[1:28:18] [Laughter]
[1:28:20] this so the wine PR is pronounced
[1:28:25] let's
[1:28:27] stand let's
[1:28:29] stand I'm done
[1:28:35] anyway praise the
[1:28:38] Lord don't you appreciate God's word
[1:28:42] amen I tell you I'm I'm so grateful that
[1:28:47] God gives us answers for
[1:28:51] questions things that we may ponder over
[1:28:54] and I'm sure all of y'all looked at all
[1:28:57] these scriptures before tonight right
[1:28:59] everybody you already knew all that yeah
[1:29:02] right I I I don't mind telling you I
[1:29:04] enjoyed saying it myself I've never had
[1:29:06] an issue with drinking myself I've never
[1:29:07] had problems but I know that some who
[1:29:09] have and it can be a real issue for some
[1:29:13] so why would our lord Jesus do such a
[1:29:15] thing he did not so let's ask the
[1:29:18] question again if the Lord Jesus turned
[1:29:21] water into wine why can we not drink it
[1:29:25] we can go to Food City after the service
[1:29:29] tonight and go down the aisle and you'll
[1:29:32] find Welches depends on which Food City
[1:29:35] you go to John City want to be on the
[1:29:37] right the other one be on the left 3/4
[1:29:39] way up on the top you can get the
[1:29:41] reduced sugar enough that matters to you
[1:29:44] and you'll be able to get something that
[1:29:46] would be very very similar it wouldn't
[1:29:49] be near as good now because Welches does
[1:29:51] not have the same recipe the Lord Jesus
[1:29:55] had everybody understand could our Lord
[1:30:00] create such a thing that would cause
[1:30:03] people to do all this and then shame
[1:30:06] them for doing it
[1:30:09] no praise the Lord let's bow our heads
[1:30:14] together father we so love you
[1:30:17] tonight I thank you for these young
[1:30:20] people Lord I I so appreciate them want
[1:30:24] to
[1:30:25] know and Desiring father to understand
[1:30:28] that's the reason that we have these
[1:30:30] questions to where we can meet together
[1:30:33] it was very important to our Prophet all
[1:30:36] the years that I was in Pentecost I
[1:30:38] never did a question answers I was
[1:30:41] actually never in a question answer
[1:30:44] service I was quite stunned actually
[1:30:47] whenever I begin to realize how many
[1:30:50] that brother Brenham did and then as I
[1:30:51] begin to look at it I realized
[1:30:54] what a benefit it
[1:30:56] was the message was him bringing what
[1:30:59] you placed on his
[1:31:01] heart to us question and answers was us
[1:31:07] and people like us that either
[1:31:10] misunderstood or we didn't get all of
[1:31:13] what he meant by it and it was us asking
[1:31:16] for for clarification or asking parts
[1:31:19] that he didn't adequately cover
[1:31:24] and we realize he didn't do it one time
[1:31:27] but he did it over and over again
[1:31:31] through the years of his
[1:31:34] ministry and he said he'd like to find
[1:31:36] out what was on the church's
[1:31:40] heart so in
[1:31:42] August of 64 he took two weekends
[1:31:46] 823 and 8:30 two weekends to answer
[1:31:52] questions oh how great they were and
[1:31:55] brother brandham didn't want to just
[1:31:58] just the people to ask him from the
[1:32:00] audience and him not be
[1:32:03] prepared but he told the people to lay
[1:32:06] the questions up on the desk so he would
[1:32:10] be able to study
[1:32:12] beforehand maybe the young people wonder
[1:32:14] why I do it this way because this is the
[1:32:19] example that I have to
[1:32:22] follow now Lord if I would have stood
[1:32:24] here tonight and we would have had just
[1:32:26] an open
[1:32:28] discussion and someone would have asked
[1:32:31] this question word for
[1:32:34] word my answer tonight would not have
[1:32:39] been what I gave
[1:32:42] them because I would have not had been
[1:32:45] so prepared to be able to give them such
[1:32:48] an
[1:32:49] answer but since I already received this
[1:32:52] question then it gave me all all this
[1:32:55] time they would not even believe the
[1:32:57] amount of hours that I've spent
[1:33:01] studying just this one question hours
[1:33:05] and hours of scripture hours and hours
[1:33:08] of the message hours and
[1:33:11] hours so whenever they ask a question I
[1:33:14] don't want the answer to be off the top
[1:33:16] of my head and I guess and maybe
[1:33:19] perhaps but I want the answer to be as
[1:33:22] thorough as I can possibly give
[1:33:25] it thank you for this time together
[1:33:28] Lord I've so enjoyed these question
[1:33:31] answer
[1:33:33] Services we love you so much
[1:33:37] Jesus Lord
[1:33:39] we we we're not asking for the natural
[1:33:42] wine but we sure are asking for that
[1:33:46] spiritual wine
[1:33:48] Lord that you'd so stimulate our souls
[1:33:51] at this
[1:33:52] hour as we we looked at it last night
[1:33:55] the anointings are being made
[1:33:58] clear upon what's on the earth in the
[1:34:00] last
[1:34:02] day we can see that the
[1:34:05] pre-tribulation anointing is on the
[1:34:07] earth and the people are getting drunk
[1:34:09] on it hundreds more people arrested
[1:34:16] today Lord
[1:34:18] people are just
[1:34:20] insane the things they are saying the
[1:34:23] things they are
[1:34:25] doing Lord Jesus we can see that the
[1:34:28] headship of Satan is fixing to come to
[1:34:32] fruition then Lord God we
[1:34:36] believe that your headship is
[1:34:39] also you're wanting to manifest yourself
[1:34:41] in your
[1:34:43] bride Satan will actually be
[1:34:46] crowned
[1:34:49] King by his
[1:34:51] church by his subjects
[1:34:54] by his people of the last
[1:34:58] day he could not attain this
[1:35:02] Crown if it were not for his
[1:35:06] church Lord Jesus you're waiting for
[1:35:09] your crown
[1:35:11] too for you have not yet been been

[1:35:33] together up to Father's
[1:35:36] house I don't know exactly what the time
[1:35:39] frame will be but sometime in between
[1:35:42] that time and your Advent to the Earth
[1:35:46] to fight that battle of
[1:35:48] Armageddon the Saints will Crown you

[1:39:11] Me amen do you enjoy that tonight amen I
[1:39:15] don't I don't expect that question to
[1:39:16] ever get asked
[1:39:18] again if you didn't get it tonight I
[1:39:20] don't know how any way you could you
[1:39:23] could understand it any clearer than
[1:39:24] that that's I didn't drink wine just
[1:39:27] because I was told not
[1:39:29] to now I know why I was told not
[1:39:32] to but and and as he was talking there I
[1:39:36] was I was thinking you know at the
[1:39:38] police department for many years most of
[1:39:40] my kns were dealing with people on drugs
[1:39:43] and
[1:39:44] alcohol um brother Rob probably dealt
[1:39:46] with more of that than I have and
[1:39:50] actually got some of his people
[1:39:55] but hundreds
[1:39:58] hundreds of of people in in my career
[1:40:01] that and they're they're all different
[1:40:02] they all act different they all do
[1:40:05] things that you wouldn't think humanly
[1:40:07] possible but there's one that
[1:40:10] always I think of it so often and
[1:40:12] happened over 22 years
[1:40:15] ago I got sent to a an
[1:40:20] apartment this woman there she's about
[1:40:22] 38 years old
[1:40:24] she had two cute little
[1:40:27] boys they were 10 and 12 years
[1:40:31] old mom was
[1:40:35] alcoholic and she was going through
[1:40:37] withdrawals and she'd become homicidal
[1:40:39] and
[1:40:40] suicidal so they sent me over there to
[1:40:43] deal with her and I I got her calmed
[1:40:44] down and got her talked into going to
[1:40:47] the hospital with me and as I got there
[1:40:50] and begin to talk to her she began to
[1:40:53] tell me her issues and her problems how
[1:40:56] she
[1:40:57] got hooked on
[1:40:59] alcohol you I I mention her I said if
[1:41:01] you tried
[1:41:03] God she said I've tried that that don't
[1:41:08] work she said right now this very
[1:41:13] minute she said I would trade both my
[1:41:16] boys for one can of
[1:41:18] [Music]
[1:41:22] beer you know that broke my heart at the
[1:41:24] moment I had to do my reporting you know
[1:41:27] and I got to
[1:41:30] thinking you know in the scripture Jesus
[1:41:33] talks about the new wine several times
[1:41:36] and you got to understand he says I am
[1:41:38] the vine you are the branches do you
[1:41:40] understand what bears the
[1:41:42] fruit it's not the
[1:41:44] vine the vine doesn't bear the fruit the
[1:41:47] branches you bear the fruit and what is
[1:41:49] inside that fruit what is inside that
[1:41:51] grape it's the life
[1:41:53] that came from the
[1:41:56] vine if we could have the same attitude
[1:41:59] that she
[1:42:01] had become so addicted to that new
[1:42:07] wine I would say Lord I would trade this
[1:42:10] old man that's right I would
[1:42:14] trade this old man for that new one for
[1:42:18] one more
[1:42:20] drop alcohol does some some strange
[1:42:24] things new wine does some strange
[1:42:28] things brother Donnie was talking about
[1:42:30] how people get so intoxicated that their
[1:42:33] blood and they they survive in the cold
[1:42:36] we had a a man that I dealt with my
[1:42:38] entire career at Johnson City his name
[1:42:40] was Steve Bradshaw he's passed on May he
[1:42:43] rest in
[1:42:45] peace I've never been with Steve one
[1:42:48] time not one single
[1:42:50] second I don't know what he would be
[1:42:52] like sober cuz I've never seen him
[1:42:54] sober we would find Steve out in the
[1:42:57] cold in the winter in the rain close
[1:43:01] half
[1:43:02] off passed out but alive is me and you
[1:43:06] he's been hit by
[1:43:08] cars been
[1:43:11] sick but he went through it all
[1:43:15] intoxicated you get intoxicated no
[1:43:18] matter how cold this world gets no
[1:43:21] matter how cold life around you gets no
[1:43:24] matter what you get hit
[1:43:27] with it's that new
[1:43:29] wine until you want it like you want
[1:43:33] nothing else you'll not be ready to go
[1:43:37] you want you you want to be consumed
[1:43:38] with it those that are Rapture Ready are
[1:43:42] so intoxicated they can't see anything
[1:43:45] else so I I hope you enjoyed that
[1:43:47] tonight I didn't mean to get up here and
[1:43:49] preach brother Donnie I
[1:43:51] apologize but that that that is my hope
