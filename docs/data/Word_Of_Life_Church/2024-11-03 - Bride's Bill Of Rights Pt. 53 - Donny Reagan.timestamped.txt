[39:33] God no matter what your facing today and
[39:36] difficulties that might be in your life
[39:38] or your home on the job whatever it is
[39:42] remember he's promised his presence will
[39:46] never leave
[39:47] us sometimes we think he does because we
[39:51] don't feel him but we don't go by what
[39:53] we feel we go by what he says amen amen
[39:57] amen how he's happy to be in the house
[39:59] of God today it's a great privilege for
[40:01] us in it let's turn to
[40:04] Daniel chter 7 verse 10
[40:08] today Daniel 7:
[40:12] 10 I want to speak to you today by the
[40:14] help of the Lord on the
[40:17] right to the
[40:20] god of
[40:22] love the right to the god of love
[40:27] now listen to me carefully not the right
[40:30] to the love of
[40:32] God but the right to the
[40:35] god of
[40:38] love there's all kinds of things that
[40:41] God
[40:42] loves but they don't have the right to
[40:45] love him
[40:46] back he loved the blue the azer colors
[40:50] in the sky he loves the color of the
[40:53] ocean he loves the green God must really
[40:56] like green don't he you ever notice how
[40:58] much green there is in the in the earth
[41:02] God loves that but green can't love God
[41:05] back that's right the sky can love him
[41:08] back he loves a variety of colors and
[41:12] birds
[41:13] plumage white brown green the peacock is
[41:18] just so beautiful with its variety of
[41:20] colors yet the colors and their
[41:23] pigmentation cannot love him back so
[41:27] your blessed today cuz you get to love
[41:29] him
[41:31] back Daniel 7:
[41:35] 10 a fiery stream issued and came forth
[41:39] from before
[41:40] him
[41:42] thousand
[41:44] thousands
[41:46] thousand
[41:47] thousands ministered unto him and 10,000
[41:53] times
[41:55] 10,000 stood
[41:58] before
[41:59] him so thousand thousands
[42:04] ministered unto
[42:06] him 10,000 times
[42:10] 10,000 stood before him the Judgment was
[42:14] said and the books were open 1 John 4
[42:20] verse
[42:23] 7
[42:25] beloved let us love love one another for
[42:29] love is of
[42:32] God and everyone that love us is born of
[42:39] god
[42:41] wow so you mean just because a person
[42:44] can love something means they're born of
[42:48] God you see John is using a
[42:51] differentiation in the word
[42:53] love people love pizza
[42:57] right yeah people love their car they
[42:59] love their house some people love the
[43:02] beach some people love mountains and we
[43:05] say I love the color of that suit I love
[43:09] the color of that dress do they yeah
[43:12] they do but just because you love like
[43:15] that don't mean that you love God right
[43:18] amen Now watch how John said it beloved
[43:20] let us love one another for love is of
[43:23] God and everyone that love us love us
[43:26] what what not trees not grass not pizza
[43:30] not cars but everyone that loveth one
[43:35] another that's right is born of God and
[43:40] knoweth
[43:42] God he that loveth not
[43:46] knoweth not God for
[43:51] God
[43:53] is
[43:55] amen now notice John does not say that
[43:58] God loves and he
[44:00] does but he actually is
[44:04] love for God is love verse 16 and we
[44:10] have
[44:11] known and believ the love that God has
[44:15] to
[44:16] us God is love he that dwelleth in love
[44:24] dwelleth in God now notice where your
[44:28] house
[44:30] is where your place of residence
[44:34] is he that
[44:38] dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God
[44:43] in
[44:44] him to me this
[44:46] profoundly placed put together
[44:50] scripture must be one of the
[44:53] greatest in the entire Canon of the
[44:56] Bible
[44:58] love is not
[44:59] simply a quality which God possesses but
[45:04] rather love is that which is his
[45:08] very
[45:10] nature so the love of
[45:13] God and the god of love the love of God
[45:20] and the god of love I hope today each of
[45:23] us in this building have a right to be
[45:27] able to love this God I may like to be
[45:30] remembered as we pray together today
[45:33] let's just hold our needs our request in
[45:35] our
[45:37] hearts Lord Jesus we're so grateful for
[45:40] this opportunity again that we could
[45:43] assemble today in this place that you've
[45:45] given us to be able to Worship You
[45:47] Lord we've not gathered that we could
[45:51] show off our clothes or gather together
[45:54] that we could talk about what's going on
[45:56] in the world though that certainly
[45:58] concerns us but Lord we believe church
[46:03] is a very special time Church to us is
[46:07] not just a social Gathering to where we
[46:11] can gather together and socialize and we
[46:14] do do that but yet it's more than that
[46:17] to
[46:18] us it's to hear from you and then in
[46:22] turn let you hear back from us it's to
[46:26] meet our brothers and sisters and greet
[46:29] them the people that we believe we will
[46:32] spend eternity with we've also come for
[46:35] correction today if we need to be
[46:38] corrected we've come for encouragement
[46:41] we've come for
[46:42] healing but we've come to worship we've
[46:46] come to praise oh Jesus take charge of
[46:50] the service father help me shut my mouth
[46:53] to anything that would displease you
[46:57] granted I pray father in the name of the
[46:59] Lord Jesus and the saints of God said
[47:03] amen amen God bless you you may be
[47:10] seated the
[47:12] right to the
[47:14] god of
[47:17] love I know we say love a
[47:22] lot people say it to us a
[47:25] lot people could we can meet for the
[47:28] first
[47:29] time um Carol and I saw somebody this
[47:32] week and uh woman didn't know us from
[47:35] Adam and Eve but she said love you guys
[47:39] love you
[47:40] guys Carol said well glad to know that
[47:43] she loves us I said how can she love us
[47:45] she don't even know us I mean first time
[47:47] she ever seen us in our life so it can
[47:50] become a term that we use you know I
[47:54] mean here in East Tennessee hey buddy
[47:57] hey buddy hey buddy you know all the
[47:59] cliches that we use around here come to
[48:02] find out they're not your buddy at all
[48:04] are they so it can be that way with with
[48:07] love and we should love we should not
[48:10] only love our own kind but we should
[48:13] love those that are beyond our kind
[48:16] that's what God did in order to save the
[48:20] world God so Lov the world that he gave
[48:22] his only begotten son you know the rest
[48:24] of the scripture that they might be
[48:26] saved if they wish to be but yet it
[48:29] doesn't mean that everybody that God
[48:32] loved will have the ability to be able
[48:36] to love him back so to receive the love
[48:40] of God is one thing versus the god of
[48:46] love the love of God as I mentioned it
[48:48] last week gives every Mortal on the
[48:51] Earth today fresh air you ever try to
[48:54] figure that out you know you make a
[48:56] little something sisters in your house
[48:58] and uh whatever it is that you're
[49:00] cooking and it leaves a remnant of that
[49:02] smell in your house or your car you
[49:06] carry something in your car and it
[49:08] leaves a little bit of Remnant think of
[49:10] all the debris that is rotting after
[49:14] this hurricane that we've been through
[49:16] the water how bad that it is and the
[49:19] trees tend of thousands of trees that
[49:23] are rotting and yet how come does not
[49:27] fill the air with stench why is it that
[49:31] the mud that was all stirred up by the
[49:33] flood waters doesn't totally overwhelm
[49:36] the scent that's on the earth and yet we
[49:39] walk out we don't even smell it if you
[49:41] didn't know any better you would never
[49:43] know that you're 11 or 12 miles just
[49:45] down the road from horrendous sites of
[49:49] trees that were uprooted others that
[49:51] were blown down and all types of things
[49:54] and burning burning and burning and
[49:56] burning trees to get rid of them and yet
[49:59] why doesn't the whole earth smell like
[50:01] that because God made a way for the
[50:04] ozone layer which is above the Earth to
[50:07] be able to purify so he caused the trees
[50:11] to be able to take in the carbon
[50:13] monoxide and the other things and put
[50:15] out what oxygen so God has this gigantic
[50:19] thing going on in the Earth every day
[50:21] that we live there people don't even
[50:23] think about it they just when it becomes
[50:26] weather with they can they can't wait to
[50:28] open a door crack a window to let in
[50:31] what what we call Fresh Air and yet
[50:34] there are millions of leaves that are
[50:37] fixing to fall off the trees thousands
[50:40] of them have already fallen right and
[50:42] yet they're fixing to start
[50:45] decomposing and they will turn back to
[50:47] matter and you reach down and pick it up
[50:50] and hold it in your hands and it has a
[50:53] smell you'll see black mold you'll see
[50:56] all different types of things but how
[50:58] come the Earth doesn't smell like that
[51:01] because God knew that it needed this
[51:04] ventilation so he created a way that the
[51:07] Earth day by day would be able in all
[51:11] this deaths and all this matter that is
[51:14] rotting God made a way for the earth to
[51:17] renew itself if you look at your own
[51:19] life as a child of God and not get down
[51:23] at all the matter in your lives and and
[51:26] all the rot in your lives and all the
[51:29] rotness around the world God's given you
[51:32] a holy ghost ozone layer that you can be
[51:35] renewed and refreshed in his presence
[51:39] every day you live on the
[51:41] earth but it's going to depend upon you
[51:44] will you allow the spirit of God to
[51:47] renew your joy and to renew the
[51:50] opportunities that you have or are you
[51:52] just going to constantly go around
[51:54] picking up the rotten leaves and the
[51:56] rotten woods and the rotten this and
[51:58] that and the other and there's mushrooms
[52:00] over there and there's all type of
[52:02] bacteria and things here and there you
[52:04] going to focus on that there's all kinds
[52:06] of it out there to focus on if you wish
[52:08] to or you can focus on God has been so
[52:11] good to me I don't deserve anything that
[52:15] he's done but he didn't do it because I
[52:17] deserved it he did it because he loved
[52:20] me now truly every one of us today
[52:23] whether or not you're even a Christian
[52:25] have experienced the love of God okay so
[52:28] it's a quarter till to 12 and we're
[52:30] sitting here we've been here now for a
[52:32] little bit and we've experienced oxygen
[52:35] we've exchanged lungs the air in our
[52:38] lungs multiple hundreds of times since
[52:40] you've been here already our blood has
[52:42] been able to take the food that we
[52:44] digested early the enzymes from our body
[52:46] rush into our our gases and acids and so
[52:49] on inside the stomach have already
[52:51] started doing that the love of God
[52:53] giving you another day to live the white
[52:56] blood cells the red blood cells already
[52:58] going about taking whatever it was you
[53:00] ate for breakfast all this is going on
[53:02] every day of your life you don't even
[53:04] thank God for it most of us don't even
[53:06] think nothing about it unless we start
[53:08] having problems then we begin to think
[53:11] about it right so we we absolutely
[53:13] experience the love of God every day you
[53:16] was able to get up out of bed this
[53:18] morning that was the mercy of God to you
[53:21] you're able to take a breath you're able
[53:22] to have a church where you can come and
[53:25] be able to worship God in spirit and in
[53:27] truth what is that the love of God but
[53:30] does that mean that every person that
[53:33] experiences that element or measure of
[53:36] love has the god of
[53:39] love now to experience the love of God
[53:43] and to have the god of love is two
[53:46] different things now the love of God was
[53:49] extended in John 3:16 as we quoted it
[53:52] already that God so loved the world that
[53:54] he gave his only begotten son that
[53:56] whosoever believeth in him should not
[53:58] perish but have everlasting life for God
[54:01] sent not his son into the world to
[54:04] condemn the world but that the world
[54:06] through him might be saved now that's a
[54:09] great thing is it not and there will be
[54:11] millions of John 3:16 people as a matter
[54:15] of fact we just read about it here in
[54:17] the Book of Daniel and they will stand
[54:19] Before the Throne of God many of them
[54:23] will never be capable to enter in into
[54:27] the god of love yeah they will say I
[54:31] experienced the love of God I was a
[54:33] drunk I was a liar I was a wherer and
[54:37] God forgave me of my sins and and I
[54:40] found a church and I went there and then
[54:43] I I I heard other people talk about the
[54:45] Holy Ghost and I never had the Holy
[54:47] Ghost I never saw a need to give up
[54:50] habits in my life or that in my life but
[54:53] you can't tell me I did not experience
[54:56] the love of
[54:57] God and you know what they did God
[55:01] forgave them and many of them become
[55:04] church members and this church or that
[55:06] church whatever church that they chose
[55:08] to go to and they still experience the
[55:11] love of God and blessings and material
[55:15] things and other things that God did for
[55:17] them but does that mean because they
[55:20] experience the love of God they have the
[55:23] god of
[55:25] love here you see John was the disciple
[55:28] of love as we know but yet we also know
[55:32] from the preview that we see of John uh
[55:36] him and his brother how that they asked
[55:39] for a particular place in the Kingdom of
[55:42] Jesus now that was not the love of God
[55:45] that John was going to experience so
[55:47] what I find amazing is that the disciple
[55:50] of Love wasn't always the disciple of
[55:53] love he was a disciple of selfishness
[55:57] so it wasn't like that John was born
[56:00] this Golden Child and he always had this
[56:03] supreme Insight of the love of God and
[56:06] he was just this perfect figure now
[56:09] truly no doubt he was altogether
[56:11] different than Peter I imagine Peter
[56:13] start getting whooped from the time he
[56:15] is two w up you know Peter just got
[56:17] ragged on I mean he must have got his
[56:19] mouth mashed over and over again for
[56:21] those of you that don't know Kentucky
[56:23] language what that is you say something
[56:25] and your mama reaches back and smacks
[56:27] you right in the Smacker and it kind of
[56:29] helps you pay more attention what you're
[56:30] going to say next time so John was not
[56:34] you know like that in the way that Peter
[56:36] was but John himself still did not have
[56:39] the god of love now we know there was a
[56:42] special something about him and Jesus
[56:44] loved him but yet John could never have
[56:46] that God of love until he received his
[56:49] portion of the pillar of fire on the day
[56:52] of Pentecost and John even though he
[56:55] experienced an element of the love of
[56:57] God in saving him and he experienced an
[57:00] element of the love of God and being
[57:02] close to the Lord Jesus as a matter of
[57:04] fact the only disciple that we know
[57:07] according to the four gospels that was
[57:09] there at the sight of the Cross all the
[57:12] rest of them had fled away so it seems
[57:15] as if though John had an element of love
[57:18] that even Peter and James Mar you some
[57:20] of the rest of the brothers did not have
[57:22] but John did not have the god of love
[57:26] though he experienced the love of God
[57:30] now what what I'm looking at this
[57:31] morning is that once God uh expanded and
[57:37] and allowed this type of love to leave
[57:40] from his own being he knew that once he
[57:46] ever let this go out of
[57:49] himself that this love
[57:52] released would demand Fellowship
[57:57] ship now listen once
[58:00] love is released and you me whoever it
[58:05] is Mortals on the earth that begin to
[58:08] acknowledge a love then it will
[58:13] demand Fellowship it's just automatic
[58:17] with love so you take a young man a
[58:19] young woman and they come to that age
[58:21] and they start thinking about boyfriends
[58:24] and girlfriends and all of that and then
[58:27] they get up very old 2021 and they're
[58:30] they're just convinced totally that
[58:32] they're doomed to a life of celibacy
[58:34] their whole life you know cuz their life
[58:36] is just about over they ain't got a
[58:37] girlfriend or a boyfriend and if they
[58:39] reach 25 or 26 I mean they are in major
[58:42] major desperation right brothers so you
[58:45] see some of these young men laughing at
[58:46] me here this morning because something
[58:49] in them is expressing and they they
[58:53] never felt that way when they were
[58:55] little bitt
[58:56] but something in them is calling for an
[59:00] expression and that love demands
[59:04] Fellowship so then they start talking to
[59:06] girls and the girls start talking to
[59:08] boys and they go to camps and now y'all
[59:11] can act like that I'm the old fogy
[59:13] Pastor okay and that I don't know what
[59:14] I'm talking about but there's been many
[59:16] of our youths around the message that
[59:19] have met their mate at youth camps and
[59:22] then there's been many of our youth who
[59:24] met the devil at Youth Camp
[59:26] camps and they'd been better off if
[59:28] they' never met that boy or girl that
[59:30] they met because it want to cause them a
[59:33] lot of trouble but what is that they're
[59:35] in the quest and the search for a demand
[59:39] of Love cuz there's something in them
[59:42] and it's like it's it's reaching out for
[59:45] the love of someone that can love them
[59:48] back listen this and God's provided
[59:51] approach the Divine Fellowship the
[59:53] prophet said that there is a True
[59:55] Fellowship
[59:56] and God is love and love demands love
[1:00:02] Demands a fellowship now I'm sure all of
[1:00:05] us know of people you know they really
[1:00:07] don't like being around people they like
[1:00:10] horses better than they do humans they
[1:00:12] like dogs they like cats they like you
[1:00:14] know whatever more they like just being
[1:00:16] by theel they'd rather be by theel and
[1:00:19] they are their most favorite company
[1:00:21] they talk to theel they eat with theel
[1:00:24] they just rather be about you know
[1:00:26] there's something wrong with that person
[1:00:27] I mean I hate to be the one to tell you
[1:00:28] today but if they really love right love
[1:00:33] demands Fellowship love demands
[1:00:37] Fellowship now we all need that private
[1:00:38] time I'm not saying there's something
[1:00:40] weird with you about that but God made
[1:00:42] us to be social creatures watch again he
[1:00:45] says it a little bit different and what
[1:00:47] made God provide this way because God is
[1:00:51] love and love demands Fellowship love
[1:00:56] demands Fellowship so he repeats it that
[1:00:59] love demands Fellowship I I can only
[1:01:02] imagine in my mind today as you that we
[1:01:05] would be able to go back to the Garden
[1:01:06] of Eden and think of what a perfect love
[1:01:09] that Adam and Eve must have had in the
[1:01:12] Garden of Eden and that perfect love was
[1:01:15] between each other and it was between
[1:01:18] them and God it's something to be honest
[1:01:21] with you that most of us have never
[1:01:23] experienced if by the new birth we
[1:01:25] become born again and we become changed
[1:01:28] then we're entering into that perfect
[1:01:30] love but still we will find people that
[1:01:33] we will struggle with being able to
[1:01:35] really love them the way we do others
[1:01:38] any humans still here today that can nod
[1:01:40] your head or say Amen you see it was
[1:01:43] totally unlike that in the Garden of
[1:01:45] Eden there was nothing there that they
[1:01:47] had to struggle there's only two human
[1:01:49] beings on the Earth but there was no
[1:01:51] strain between Adam and Eve and God had
[1:01:54] to make them in this perfect lovable
[1:01:58] condition so there was nothing about
[1:02:01] Adam that Eve would have disliked there
[1:02:04] was nothing about Eve that Adam would
[1:02:07] have disliked and there was nothing
[1:02:09] about either or of them that God
[1:02:12] disliked so it was the pure perfect love
[1:02:16] of God issuing force from the stream of
[1:02:20] its origination now we know that
[1:02:22] according to the way that Moses wrote it
[1:02:24] there in the Book of Genesis he said
[1:02:26] that there were four rivers that came
[1:02:29] down through the paradise of God and he
[1:02:32] gives us the great name of them and he
[1:02:34] tells us of where they started and how
[1:02:37] they come through and the tigress and
[1:02:39] the eus and you remember reading that in
[1:02:41] the Bible and we know that a couple of
[1:02:43] those have been lost but yet there's
[1:02:45] some of those that are still flowing and
[1:02:48] yet the beginning or the origination of
[1:02:52] those rivers and it's amazing because
[1:02:54] when God had Moses to WR it that he
[1:02:56] would say about the gold and this and
[1:02:59] that and the other that was in the
[1:03:01] Garden of Eden and the gold was good
[1:03:04] there so he took something out of that
[1:03:06] paradise and be to describe what it was
[1:03:10] so we know then that Not only was uh
[1:03:13] Euphrates there and the tigress and the
[1:03:15] other rivers that were there but also
[1:03:18] there was another River and it was the
[1:03:21] river of perfect love its issue had
[1:03:25] started already before the foundation of
[1:03:29] the world because Angels come out of God
[1:03:33] the elect Angels come out of those
[1:03:36] attributes of God which can never fail
[1:03:40] now unlike us God has thoughts and
[1:03:43] attributes of things that he wants which
[1:03:46] will only be in time and there are other
[1:03:50] things that comes out of him that are of
[1:03:53] his own Essence which means
[1:03:56] that they are of Eternal quality but God
[1:03:59] knew that there would be day and there
[1:04:02] would be night and yet we know according
[1:04:05] to Revelation 21 and 22 whenever John
[1:04:08] saw the city he said there will be no
[1:04:11] night there there just inside the city
[1:04:14] so there are things then that we
[1:04:16] experience here on the earth that will
[1:04:19] not be in the eth day there are things
[1:04:21] that we experience now that those who
[1:04:24] have already passed Beyond on the
[1:04:25] curtain of time and gone in the sixth
[1:04:27] Dimension they will not experience nor
[1:04:30] will they experience it again but there
[1:04:32] are other things of God that are Eternal
[1:04:35] so it's as if God was selective in
[1:04:38] through which part these thoughts
[1:04:41] projected forth and came into existence
[1:04:44] and we know that from this Great River
[1:04:47] of Love God himself began to allow this
[1:04:51] to be expressed and the first thing that
[1:04:53] he made was angels and they wor
[1:04:55] worshiped him then he entered into this
[1:04:57] attribute called God because God is an
[1:05:00] object of worship before that he was
[1:05:02] just the Eternal he dwelt
[1:05:05] alone with his
[1:05:09] thoughts the lonely
[1:05:13] God but he
[1:05:15] knows if he ever expresses this love it
[1:05:19] will by itself
[1:05:22] demand Fellowship
[1:05:27] so if he's going to love he's going to
[1:05:30] Fellowship but
[1:05:32] Fellowship is always
[1:05:34] risky when you're fellowshipping with
[1:05:37] something which is less than
[1:05:40] yourself now God knew when he made the
[1:05:43] man if he would have left him in spirit
[1:05:46] form the man could not have fallen but
[1:05:50] in spirit form his wife's identity was
[1:05:53] in him but she did not have a separate
[1:05:56] identity they were together and God knew
[1:06:00] the very moment that he divides this man
[1:06:04] whenever he breathes into his nostrils
[1:06:08] this lump of
[1:06:10] clay and the prophet said he was his
[1:06:12] toes was like roots of a tree as they
[1:06:16] were down in the ground and there he
[1:06:18] stood so God made him and he made the
[1:06:21] organs and the tissue and the bones and
[1:06:23] the brain matter and all of that and yet
[1:06:26] the man was just standing there God
[1:06:29] raises him from the table by which he
[1:06:32] had made him on the dust of the earth
[1:06:35] then God stands him up and there he
[1:06:38] stands like a
[1:06:41] statue his toes are there in the earth
[1:06:45] he's not breathing he's not moving
[1:06:48] there's no animation about him his eyes
[1:06:52] are not batting his heart is not pumping
[1:06:56] but when God breathed into his nostrils
[1:07:00] the Breath of Life animation struck this
[1:07:06] man so his heart starts
[1:07:10] pumping all of a sudden God transforms
[1:07:14] this pile of
[1:07:16] dust into blood blood cells oxygen
[1:07:21] saturation all the carbohydrates and you
[1:07:25] know all all the things in the body and
[1:07:27] all that God did an immediate
[1:07:31] transformation and this dust is standing
[1:07:34] there in this form and God
[1:07:40] breathes and Man became a living
[1:07:48] Soul so here he is straight from the
[1:07:52] river of
[1:07:54] God so God breathes into his nostrils
[1:07:57] the breath of life and it becomes a
[1:08:00] living soul
[1:08:34] then he looks at
[1:08:36] him
[1:08:39] Papa my
[1:08:42] father my
[1:08:45] papa my
[1:08:47] father now if he an expression of love
[1:08:51] love will
[1:08:52] demand Fellowship you imagine the first
[1:08:54] time that Adam and in the Garden of Eden
[1:08:56] reached out his
[1:08:58] hand to take a hold of
[1:09:01] God who was that there in the Garden of
[1:09:04] Eden ah you see it was the same one that
[1:09:07] would hang upon the cross thousands of
[1:09:08] years later and say forgive them Father
[1:09:11] for they know not what they
[1:09:15] do now he's the first one to experience
[1:09:19] life also the first Gman to experience
[1:09:22] love I'm yet to feel the way he did
[1:09:26] I'm yet to be able to look on all that
[1:09:29] creation that God made and look at it
[1:09:32] through eyes of perfection and find no
[1:09:37] fault cuz like you like me like all the
[1:09:40] rest of us we're all so deeply flawed
[1:09:43] are we
[1:09:45] not now God enters into this
[1:09:49] stage but God also knows that Adam
[1:09:52] himself maybe not right off But as time
[1:09:56] would go on that Adam would start
[1:09:58] developing these feelings
[1:10:01] too initially he was probably perfectly
[1:10:04] satisfied we don't even know how long it
[1:10:06] was might have been a year might have
[1:10:08] been 10,000 years we don't
[1:10:10] know but all of a sudden he began to
[1:10:13] develop feelings that he did not have at
[1:10:17] the original taking of the Breath of
[1:10:19] Life feelings that he did not have once
[1:10:23] God had experienced an allowed him to
[1:10:26] experience his
[1:10:27] love and now for the first time father
[1:10:31] Could Feel Love from a human
[1:10:35] being he must have been so anxious
[1:10:39] absolutely every day when he would come
[1:10:41] down on the Garden of Eden he could not
[1:10:44] wait till his son would just come up and
[1:10:47] just hug him and to be able to touch him
[1:10:50] and remember the invisible God took on a
[1:10:53] visible form and that was
[1:10:57] Christ pre Jesus preincarnate
[1:11:02] form oh God must have been under such
[1:11:05] anticipation because his love demanded
[1:11:11] Fellowship maybe it was the first
[1:11:13] afternoon after Adam felt it around noon
[1:11:16] or so maybe in the
[1:11:19] day and papa came and he got around him
[1:11:23] he said you okay son
[1:11:26] yeah I'm good I'm good I'm
[1:11:29] good is sure all
[1:11:32] right that's the way the Lord does US
[1:11:34] ain't it sometimes you sure you sure
[1:11:36] you're all right you sure you done
[1:11:38] okay Papa knew what it was
[1:11:42] oh he's come to that
[1:11:45] spot maybe it was not at the state to
[1:11:48] where God said it's not good for man to
[1:11:51] be alone maybe it just started out with
[1:11:53] a feeling of an emotion
[1:11:55] he never felt before he had everything
[1:11:57] he wanted but whenever he started
[1:11:59] fellowshipping with God it's like
[1:12:03] fellowship with God brought out the
[1:12:05] desire in him to want to fellowship with
[1:12:08] more of
[1:12:10] God that's so I'm telling you friends
[1:12:12] folks around this message that think
[1:12:14] they don't need nobody they need the
[1:12:16] Holy Ghost is what they need and if they
[1:12:18] ever get the Holy Ghost they realize
[1:12:20] they need to find a church somewhere
[1:12:22] that preaches the truth and they'll find
[1:12:24] out they need brothers and
[1:12:25] sisters come on now Heaven ain't going
[1:12:28] to be made with a bunch of cabins on the
[1:12:30] hill and you're 500,000 miles away from
[1:12:33] your closest neighbor I know some of you
[1:12:35] think that's the ideal place of Heaven
[1:12:37] There ain't no such a thing well praise
[1:12:40] the
[1:12:41] Lord so something in him and then we
[1:12:44] know of course what God
[1:12:46] did and then when God looks at them oh
[1:12:50] my it was it was just unexplainable
[1:12:55] whenever he looked and she looked at him
[1:12:58] and he looked at
[1:13:00] her but you see when a human
[1:13:04] learns how to
[1:13:08] love they are so
[1:13:13] dangerous and when they learn the
[1:13:16] rewards of
[1:13:18] love and that's when Satan tries to get
[1:13:23] them no you understand me today the more
[1:13:27] you embrace the light of God and the
[1:13:29] more you Embrace God's
[1:13:32] love it opens up an element of
[1:13:34] vulnerability about you that was not
[1:13:37] there when you were a sinner that's
[1:13:39] right amen because you have now delved
[1:13:43] into the realm of the
[1:13:46] Supernatural and then what you have to
[1:13:48] be careful for is that your love of the
[1:13:52] supernatural does not become
[1:13:56] overcome by the wrong
[1:13:59] Supernatural yes sir because once we get
[1:14:03] to the realm of Supernatural then
[1:14:05] remember Satan always has an element
[1:14:08] himself of
[1:14:10] Supernatural reserved for those who want
[1:14:15] Supernatural Well praise the Lord that's
[1:14:17] why the prophet said in Harvest time
[1:14:19] that the devil can hand out them
[1:14:21] Supernatural gifts by the handful now he
[1:14:24] don't offer that to people who don't
[1:14:26] love Supernatural cuz they don't believe
[1:14:28] in it but if you love Supernatural and
[1:14:33] we have to if we love God because he is
[1:14:36] Supernatural so it's like before that
[1:14:39] become awoken in us we were not aware
[1:14:42] that it was there and that love you know
[1:14:44] but once it becomes and you love
[1:14:46] Supernatural God and you love the
[1:14:49] supernatural element then Satan also
[1:14:52] knows okay they've been awakened to that
[1:14:54] and now that love for Supernatural will
[1:14:57] demand
[1:14:59] fellowship and then God listen God
[1:15:02] himself will even allow him to come and
[1:15:05] try you to see if you will judge your
[1:15:10] Supernatural love and your Supernatural
[1:15:13] desire you will judge it by the word so
[1:15:18] Satan hands you a gift and yet that gift
[1:15:20] is not exactly with a word you will
[1:15:22] reject that gift if you love of him
[1:15:25] right because you know God don't tell
[1:15:28] lies that's right well praise the Lord
[1:15:33] so I've turned now Adam and Eve fall in
[1:15:36] the Garden of Eden and then of course we
[1:15:38] know the the fall and how the story goes
[1:15:40] and how that they both were expressing
[1:15:42] after the fall they showed that they had
[1:15:45] now went down the tributary of time and
[1:15:49] they had made this extensive long
[1:15:52] journey listen just by one little simple
[1:15:55] Act of Disobedience they had now left
[1:15:59] the mouths of this Great River of
[1:16:02] perfect love and they found them
[1:16:05] themselves having journeyed by one
[1:16:07] little sin had now journeyed way on down
[1:16:12] the river and the tributary of love so
[1:16:15] now they don't love each other right and
[1:16:18] they don't love God right now they still
[1:16:23] love but they're love love is not from
[1:16:26] the
[1:16:27] source the way it
[1:16:29] was cuz they loved
[1:16:33] perfectly now they're loving in a flawed
[1:16:36] way so you can see Adam's selfishness
[1:16:40] the woman thou
[1:16:42] gavest and then the woman well the
[1:16:44] serpent did this and what are they doing
[1:16:46] blaming everybody and their brother boy
[1:16:48] as a pastor I hear that all the time
[1:16:51] well it's so and so's fault it's so and
[1:16:53] so I'll tell you one if they wouldn't
[1:16:55] Hypocrites at church I'd go to church
[1:16:57] that don't stop you from going to
[1:16:59] Walmart does it that going to stop you
[1:17:02] from going to longh Horn today for
[1:17:04] dinner you're going to get up and make a
[1:17:06] public announcement every gay leave this
[1:17:08] restaurant while I'm here every liar
[1:17:11] leave this restaurant of course you
[1:17:12] ain't going to do it you're going to go
[1:17:13] in there and sit down and sit there and
[1:17:15] smile like a Poss if they bring your
[1:17:17] steak out there your chicken whatever
[1:17:20] and you're going to sit there and you
[1:17:21] see somebody's green hair and purple
[1:17:23] streaks down the back of it you see two
[1:17:25] men holding hands you're going to say
[1:17:30] pitiful that's the way you ought to do
[1:17:32] the house of God you ought not to let
[1:17:35] this person or that person or that
[1:17:37] person stop you you ought to say I'm not
[1:17:40] going because of them I'm not going
[1:17:43] because of that person I'm going because
[1:17:46] I am a worshiper and my love and my
[1:17:50] heart demands Fellowship
[1:18:02] now during this whole
[1:18:04] time can you imagine what God
[1:18:07] Lost In the Garden of
[1:18:10] Eden the
[1:18:13] love of his
[1:18:16] life now for those of us in our assembly
[1:18:18] who've lost a husband or a wife and
[1:18:21] there's a great love that a parent has
[1:18:23] for a child there's no question about it
[1:18:25] there's a great love that you have for
[1:18:27] your nieces nephews and cousins and so
[1:18:29] on and so on but oh if a man has a woman
[1:18:32] that God GES him gave him rather and she
[1:18:35] has a man that God gave her and their
[1:18:36] Eternal mates together what a loss that
[1:18:39] is if God takes one before the other and
[1:18:42] you feel like your life will never ever
[1:18:44] be the same and in one way it won't why
[1:18:47] because as we said that was the love of
[1:18:50] my life
[1:18:56] so now God points to the gate and said
[1:18:59] you all get
[1:19:04] out leave
[1:19:11] today but when he looked at
[1:19:14] him it just so overwhelmed
[1:19:17] him and he come down in front of them
[1:19:20] and said to the woman not to the
[1:19:23] man I I I will bring enmity between thy
[1:19:28] seed and the seed of the
[1:19:31] serpent I will bring you back isn't that
[1:19:35] amazing that he said that to the woman
[1:19:37] not to the
[1:19:39] man Satan used the woman through what
[1:19:43] her Avenue of
[1:19:46] love so what she did was she allowed
[1:19:51] herself she come to that spot
[1:19:55] of
[1:19:57] loving and Satan perverted that
[1:20:00] love what was it
[1:20:03] lust praise the Lord but you see if God
[1:20:07] would have kept that within her
[1:20:09] harnessed it never allowed her to
[1:20:11] experience it she would have never known
[1:20:14] she would have never known anything
[1:20:15] about it but love
[1:20:18] demanded
[1:20:20] Fellowship don't you understand when you
[1:20:22] go to hanging around the wrong people oh
[1:20:25] listen school kids you're going to
[1:20:26] school you're going to college you got
[1:20:27] to be careful because Satan will try to
[1:20:30] pull you into the wrong Fellowship doing
[1:20:33] the wrong things why cuz there's
[1:20:35] something in humans is that right yes
[1:20:39] sir so God must
[1:20:43] start all over
[1:20:48] again so he lost the love of his
[1:20:53] life but actually when you know where
[1:20:56] something
[1:20:57] is it's not really lost out of
[1:21:01] existence it's just
[1:21:04] temporarily
[1:21:06] misplaced ain't that right now as far as
[1:21:09] God's way of keeping time remember all
[1:21:13] of this and the span of what man has
[1:21:15] been upon the Earth the fall the cross
[1:21:17] the resurrection and so on one day being
[1:21:20] in his time a thousand years it's not
[1:21:23] hardly been weak
[1:21:27] yet now we look at oh it's been so
[1:21:31] long but for him it's not really been
[1:21:34] that long so in the middle of the week
[1:21:38] he died and he raised
[1:21:41] again and we know that God started in
[1:21:45] his rebuilding of his
[1:21:48] Masterpiece with a man called Abram and
[1:21:51] he brings it on down he starts love
[1:21:54] loving
[1:21:56] again
[1:21:57] loving
[1:21:59] again but now I must love ones who are
[1:22:03] so
[1:22:06] flawed not like Adam who was
[1:22:11] perfect but now that the seed's been
[1:22:14] mixed to Genesis
[1:22:17] 6 his children some of them will be
[1:22:21] murderers
[1:22:22] Liars thieves
[1:22:25] idolators and
[1:22:28] adulterers everything
[1:22:31] imaginable now his children will be that
[1:22:34] how can God
[1:22:36] love such
[1:22:40] people watch this in the church in this
[1:22:43] condition I thought of how
[1:22:45] God of the dove is such a loving bird
[1:22:47] and the dove God wanting to make love
[1:22:50] with his human beings God wants to be
[1:22:53] loved God wants to love you God so loved
[1:22:56] the world he gave his only begotten son
[1:22:58] that whosoever believeth in him shall
[1:23:00] not perish but to have everlasting life
[1:23:02] blessed be the Lord then God wanting to
[1:23:06] make
[1:23:07] love he had to make something
[1:23:11] lovable he had to make something
[1:23:15] gentle like
[1:23:19] himself he had to make something that
[1:23:21] could be loved
[1:23:24] he had to make something of his own
[1:23:29] nature oh and yet after what happened in
[1:23:33] the Garden of Eden there was an element
[1:23:36] of time to where even after that that
[1:23:39] sons of God still catered toward father
[1:23:44] Satan had not yet achieved fully what he
[1:23:47] wanted Genesis 6 now M mixes the
[1:23:52] Bloodlines and therefore the the
[1:23:56] nature so then every human being will
[1:23:59] become
[1:24:01] contaminated exactly what Satan wanted
[1:24:04] in the
[1:24:05] beginning you realize why many people
[1:24:08] cannot live right for the Lord today
[1:24:11] it's all about their love
[1:24:13] life
[1:24:15] amen yes sir it's all about their love
[1:24:18] life the things they
[1:24:20] love why I can't do this I can't do that
[1:24:24] what simple it's what do you love the
[1:24:26] most is that right it's what you love
[1:24:29] the most so then notice the key here and
[1:24:32] this is he had to make something of his
[1:24:35] own nature you couldn't love nothing
[1:24:39] that wasn't of your own
[1:24:42] nature now Lord willing this week
[1:24:45] brother Malachi and sister Chloe are
[1:24:47] going to get married and you imagine if
[1:24:50] Sister Cy would have come to me a long
[1:24:52] time ago and car and talked to us and
[1:24:55] she'd found this young man and she
[1:24:58] really really liked him and got serious
[1:25:00] about him and that's perfectly natural
[1:25:03] and normal right oh what if she would
[1:25:05] have come to me and said I found this
[1:25:09] poodle brother Donnie its hair is so
[1:25:13] curly and I was wondering could we have
[1:25:16] the wedding at the
[1:25:20] church oh you say that's crazy it is
[1:25:25] can you imagine God marrying any of us
[1:25:29] without us truly being
[1:25:32] changed now this separates the bride
[1:25:35] from the church because you see the
[1:25:37] church wants to come to God and they
[1:25:39] want to sure give him their sins give
[1:25:42] him let him go do all the hard work but
[1:25:44] they'll still keep this and this and
[1:25:47] this and this and this and this but they
[1:25:49] want God to love them so much that he
[1:25:51] just simply overlooks everything about B
[1:25:55] God is not marrying the bride because of
[1:25:58] overlooking God is marrying her because
[1:26:01] she's been so changed he will marry a
[1:26:04] bride of his own
[1:26:06] nature friend you realize what a miracle
[1:26:10] we are here today every one of you that
[1:26:12] are truly born again every person
[1:26:15] sitting here or those that are listening
[1:26:16] to this service and if you are truly
[1:26:18] born again you are a phenomenal Miracle
[1:26:23] because you were born a liar you were
[1:26:26] born lost we were born wretched we were
[1:26:29] born Wicked we were born come to the
[1:26:32] world speaking lies how in the world
[1:26:35] could God ever love us God ministered to
[1:26:38] us the love of God until the seed could
[1:26:42] grab a hold of it it'll transform the
[1:26:44] seed then the seed can get not only the
[1:26:47] love of God but the god of
[1:26:51] love Hallelujah
[1:26:54] there's something in the bride today
[1:26:57] that I believe with all of my heart that
[1:27:00] is craving for more love more love from
[1:27:05] God and more love for ourselves anybody
[1:27:08] feel that way
[1:27:13] today you couldn't love nothing that
[1:27:16] wasn't of your own
[1:27:18] nature
[1:27:19] loving has to
[1:27:22] unite with love
[1:27:24] a husband and wife has to love one
[1:27:27] another if they ever make the grade
[1:27:30] family has to love one another if they
[1:27:32] ever make the great something to be
[1:27:34] loved you search
[1:27:37] everywhere find a girl to be your wife
[1:27:40] that you love She searches finding a
[1:27:44] husband that she can
[1:27:46] love and God
[1:27:50] searches trying to find a soul
[1:27:54] that he can
[1:27:57] love here am I
[1:28:00] Lord here am I
[1:28:02] Lord Love
[1:28:06] Me Love Me
[1:28:08] Lord
[1:28:10] hallelujah so by our first nature then
[1:28:14] we were not very
[1:28:16] lovable Ephesians 2:3 says that this way
[1:28:19] among whom also we all had our
[1:28:21] conversation in times past in the the
[1:28:24] lust of our flesh fulfilling listen this
[1:28:27] the desires of the Flesh and of the mind
[1:28:31] and were by
[1:28:36] Nature by Nature oh my the children of
[1:28:41] WRA oh my wow how in the world that I
[1:28:46] become a child of
[1:28:50] WRA I believe I was conceived naturally
[1:28:53] between my mother and father is a child
[1:28:55] of
[1:28:56] love how did I become a child of
[1:29:00] rest and it wasn't in their
[1:29:03] nature it was in my
[1:29:06] own notice the word rest it says anger
[1:29:11] Vengeance temper movement or
[1:29:16] agitation of the
[1:29:18] Soul those of you that's got enough
[1:29:20] temper to fight a buz saw you need a
[1:29:23] little control switch
[1:29:25] it's called the Holy Ghost amen you may
[1:29:27] fight it all your life but it'll bring
[1:29:29] it under control so notice Paul says
[1:29:31] then we were by Nature children of Wrath
[1:29:36] even as others so here are some that
[1:29:39] were by Nature children of WRA but not
[1:29:43] by seed
[1:29:46] no
[1:29:48] a so by
[1:29:51] Nature I was a child of Wrath by nature
[1:29:55] I was identified on the other side but
[1:29:58] not by
[1:29:59] representation by
[1:30:02] seed and where do we get that at from
[1:30:05] the
[1:30:08] devil oh brother Donnie I'll tell you
[1:30:10] one thing I run my genealogy I go back
[1:30:13] to the Duke of England and I go back to
[1:30:15] the Royal House of the Scottish show and
[1:30:17] so and so and so all them was of the
[1:30:19] devil
[1:30:20] too Royal Blood there is no such a thing
[1:30:24] that's right come on somebody well I'll
[1:30:26] tell you one thing I I'm part of this
[1:30:28] particular Clan out of iron and out of
[1:30:30] this and that and the other thieves
[1:30:32] Liars
[1:30:33] whoremongers
[1:30:35] robbers that's right the Royal Blood
[1:30:37] there is only one Royal Blood that's the
[1:30:40] Lord
[1:30:41] Jesus yes sir now watch Satan can copy
[1:30:46] any kind of a gift and any kind of a
[1:30:51] manifestation listen
[1:30:54] but he
[1:30:55] can't
[1:31:01] love God
[1:31:04] is
[1:31:05] love that's right Satan can't love so
[1:31:10] all of you if there's anyone here today
[1:31:12] that's not a Christian you're living for
[1:31:13] the devil you're serving a master that
[1:31:16] can never will ever love you that's
[1:31:20] right amen yeah
[1:31:26] Satan can't love so what did we
[1:31:30] experience prior to our new birth human
[1:31:34] love but remember it's so far from the
[1:31:38] original Fountain the river where it
[1:31:40] come
[1:31:42] from now it's beyond me how that a man
[1:31:46] would want to fall in love with a man
[1:31:48] and want to marry a man okay it's beyond
[1:31:51] me it's beyond me that a woman would
[1:31:53] want to marry a woman woman do they have
[1:31:55] an element of love for them yeah no
[1:31:57] doubt they do they bear reproach of
[1:32:00] doing it they face being ridiculed
[1:32:02] laughed at rejected by their own family
[1:32:04] a lot of them is that right so they have
[1:32:06] some sort of emotion but where is it
[1:32:09] it's way on down even farther from the
[1:32:12] original creation of those of you that
[1:32:14] have married according to God's program
[1:32:16] but is it love yeah just like a person
[1:32:19] could love an animal they could love a
[1:32:21] dog or a cat or whatever more do they
[1:32:23] love it they do is it the same type of
[1:32:26] Love they have for a human if it is
[1:32:27] they're weird that's right that's right
[1:32:30] where does it come from it's coming from
[1:32:32] the river but it's way way way way way
[1:32:36] down way down you're at the bottom it's
[1:32:37] nearly at the very end of the trickle of
[1:32:40] love and this I love that person oh I
[1:32:42] know I do that's my mate I want to be
[1:32:44] with him for the rest of my life and
[1:32:45] you're looking say are you kidding me
[1:32:47] are you you kidding me why because you
[1:32:50] don't live from there you're closer to
[1:32:52] the mouse where it comes out up here oh
[1:32:55] praise the Lord and with the bride of
[1:32:58] Jesus Christ don't you understand from
[1:33:00] his mouth Goes Forth a living sword but
[1:33:03] also from his mouth Comes The Living
[1:33:06] Waters of his word and there's something
[1:33:10] in us that's pulling us back we want to
[1:33:12] go beyond brother Jim what our fathers
[1:33:14] could love I don't know about you I want
[1:33:16] to go beyond what my mother and father
[1:33:19] and they I I want to see them that day
[1:33:21] but I want to go beyond the love they
[1:33:24] were able to have for God anybody else
[1:33:26] what about some of our fathers those
[1:33:28] that originally founded this church as
[1:33:30] Happy Valley we want to go more why
[1:33:33] because the light of God is shining
[1:33:34] brighter now than it done 40 years ago
[1:33:37] or 45 years ago and as we progress in
[1:33:41] the word of God in our walk we're
[1:33:43] getting closer and closer and closer to
[1:33:46] the Fountain closer to the origination
[1:33:49] then it should not make us have more
[1:33:51] hatred it should make us have more love
[1:33:55] not only for God but for our brothers
[1:33:58] and sisters and for our fellow
[1:34:02] [Applause]
[1:34:06] men listen this you see a man humble and
[1:34:09] loving good to his neighbors and a good
[1:34:11] citizen a good fellow and a good man a
[1:34:13] Christian man full of love and humility
[1:34:16] you watch that man see that's right he's
[1:34:19] good charitable longsuffering you can
[1:34:22] talk about him it's all right like he
[1:34:25] forgives

[1:35:01] man keep your eye on
[1:35:03] him that bears and he's an
[1:35:07] example but no matter how much he shouts
[1:35:10] in church how much he does this or that
[1:35:12] or the other still hasn't got that Paul
[1:35:14] said though I speak with tongues oh my
[1:35:17] of men and of angels and though I have
[1:35:19] all these other things have enough Faith
[1:35:21] to move mountains now boy wouldn't that
[1:35:22] be a man with all keep our eyes on a man
[1:35:25] that could speak in tongues like men and
[1:35:27] angels and a man that would stand right
[1:35:29] here and move Buffalo mountain and you
[1:35:31] walk out there and say Lord have mercy
[1:35:33] what happened to that mountain that man
[1:35:34] of great faith moved it right in the
[1:35:36] middle of Johnson City they're having to

[1:36:17] way to get
[1:36:18] it come

[1:36:24] that is not the answer you always
[1:36:27] expecting oh you thought I was going to
[1:36:29] say the way to get it is point it out to
[1:36:31] people you all ain't loving me right you
[1:36:33] ain't out to you one thing come on
[1:36:36] brother no the way to get it is to love
[1:36:39] somebody else then you will be
[1:36:47] lovable praise
[1:36:50] God but remember in order for God to
[1:36:53] make us truly
[1:36:56] lovable there must be a nature change
[1:36:59] second Peter 1:4 whereby are given unto
[1:37:01] us exceeding great and precious promises
[1:37:04] that by these that by these we might be
[1:37:08] partakers of the
[1:37:12] divine
[1:37:17] nature listen at the meaning of this
[1:37:19] word
[1:37:21] divine Theos
[1:37:27] godhead
[1:37:29] spoken of the
[1:37:32] only and true
[1:37:38] God that we might be able to partake of
[1:37:45] Theos the only way that I can love him
[1:37:48] back
[1:37:49] right is he must be in me loving out
[1:37:53] that's
[1:37:55] right if I get a religious spirit and I
[1:37:57] go to church I'll love him and I'll you
[1:37:59] know I'll do all of that and people do
[1:38:01] they love him yes you the prophet tells
[1:38:03] that you can love and even love God and
[1:38:04] still be lost because you're loving from
[1:38:06] the human realm of emotion that's not
[1:38:09] what it takes to give him the love that
[1:38:11] he wants back the only way to really be
[1:38:14] able to love him is when he comes inside
[1:38:17] of us and he changes us takes the world
[1:38:21] out of us and then we start l in God
[1:38:25] like God wants to be
[1:38:28] loved and like God wants to be served so
[1:38:31] God said don't do that don't do that oh
[1:38:33] why in the world oh my goodness that's
[1:38:34] all they preach dos and don'ts and dos
[1:38:36] and don'ts and to a person that don't
[1:38:38] have God in them it's too hard to bear
[1:38:41] it's too difficult they just can't do
[1:38:45] it but if God ever gets in your soul
[1:38:50] Theos the divine nature
[1:38:54] so God in
[1:38:56] Me has no problem raising my hands and
[1:39:00] worshiping and adoring and loving when I
[1:39:04] feel so low that I feel like God don't
[1:39:07] even know my name or address anybody
[1:39:10] ever been there sure you have but yet
[1:39:13] you love him so much it's in spite of
[1:39:15] you it's beyond you and you don't just
[1:39:19] love him that way right you love others
[1:39:24] now notice that you might be partakers
[1:39:27] of the
[1:39:28] divine
[1:39:31] nature so what's this again now Divine
[1:39:34] godhead spoken of of the only and true
[1:39:37] God whatever can in any respect be liken
[1:39:42] to God or resembles him in any way
[1:39:45] hebraic which is a word form of the
[1:39:48] Hebrew language God's
[1:39:51] Representatives or vice
[1:39:58] Regent
[1:40:00] magistrates and
[1:40:03] judges The Book of Daniel
[1:40:07] again divine nature
[1:40:14] fusus the
[1:40:16] force you've seen these license place
[1:40:18] tag and bumper cigar haven't you May the
[1:40:21] force be with you yeah well I'm not sure
[1:40:23] what force they're talking about but
[1:40:24] this is the force I'm talking
[1:40:26] about if the force is with you you'll
[1:40:30] love like God and you'll forgive like
[1:40:34] God oh my brother Donnie I'll tell you
[1:40:36] one thing it runs in my neighbor we hold
[1:40:38] grudges bad and we can never forgive boy
[1:40:41] if anybody ever does anything to us we
[1:40:43] can never forget them you need the
[1:40:46] force I said you need the force get rid
[1:40:50] of the Weber and get rid of the Reagan
[1:40:52] and get rid of the Philips and the Ys
[1:40:54] and come on somebody get rid of the Nome
[1:40:57] or whoever you are and love like God
[1:41:00] loves and forgive but I'll never be able
[1:41:03] to do it I understand there's things
[1:41:05] I've been through there ain't no way in
[1:41:07] the world I could ever forgive people
[1:41:09] for what they've done to me on my own
[1:41:12] but once I got the Holy Ghost I found
[1:41:15] the power of forgiveness was in my new
[1:41:19] nature the force was in me the force was
[1:41:23] with me it's not just a nice bumper
[1:41:25] sticker it's not just a nice license
[1:41:28] Port it is our Nature by the grace of
[1:41:31] God that's how we love I love deity from
[1:41:37] my
[1:41:39] deity I love
[1:41:41] God from my
[1:41:44] part of God
[1:41:54] the
[1:41:55] force laws order of nature as opposed to
[1:41:59] what is
[1:42:03] monstrous abnormal
[1:42:06] perverse the sum now watch the sum of
[1:42:11] innate properties and
[1:42:15] Powers by which one person
[1:42:19] differs from others
[1:42:24] that you might be partakers of the
[1:42:26] divine
[1:42:28] nature 1 John
[1:42:30] 4:16 and we have known and believe the

[1:44:06] abide
[1:44:08] remain continue not to depart to be held
[1:44:14] kept in reference to state or
[1:44:18] condition to remain as
[1:44:21] one not to become
[1:44:24] another or
[1:44:27] different you see this love keeps you
[1:44:31] when you're
[1:44:32] downen this love keeps you when people
[1:44:35] don't like you this love keeps you when
[1:44:38] church people hurt your feelings anybody
[1:44:41] ever been hurt by church people yeah if
[1:44:42] you've ever been around many you have
[1:44:44] this type of Love Will Keep you when
[1:44:46] everybody misunderstands you yeah oh my
[1:44:49] brother don't that's God that you're
[1:44:51] talking about God that can do that I
[1:44:54] am that's right
[1:44:56] am and I want every bride believer in
[1:44:59] this
[1:45:01] assembly to listen to this next quote as
[1:45:03] I'll close with
[1:45:05] it there's nothing
[1:45:08] else that you can do only
[1:45:11] believe and if you believe then them
[1:45:14] little immoral things will just drop off
[1:45:18] like
[1:45:19] that as you believe
[1:45:23] you
[1:45:25] become
[1:45:33] love so we are actually in the
[1:45:37] process of
[1:45:39] becoming what God wants us to
[1:45:44] be isn't it amazing so to become you
[1:45:49] know I love the scripture that that John
[1:45:51] said he came to his own and his own
[1:45:52] received him not but to as many as
[1:45:54] received him to them gave he power to
[1:45:59] become the sons of God and that word is
[1:46:03] to come into view or it is a prophetic
[1:46:08] word that comes to pass so you were a
[1:46:12] prophetic word of a son or daughter of
[1:46:15] God and you're coming to
[1:46:18] pass you understand when the prophet
[1:46:20] goes beyond the curtain of time
[1:46:23] he loved people when he was
[1:46:26] here he loved people so much as far as
[1:46:30] human capability plus the Holy
[1:46:34] Ghost but once he moved Beyond the
[1:46:39] Veil and he moved into a realm that he
[1:46:41] had never been
[1:46:45] before then he began to describe what he
[1:46:50] felt and the people were there perfect
[1:46:53] Beyond perfect Sublime Beyond Sublime he
[1:46:56] said he knew no word in the English
[1:46:59] language that would describe it so he be
[1:47:02] to talk about what it was he was so
[1:47:04] inquisitive about what it was where I of
[1:47:06] all these Broms you these this is you're
[1:47:09] gathered to your people my people my my
[1:47:11] my people you all these brandom no these
[1:47:14] are your converts that you've led to
[1:47:18] Christ so here they come and women came
[1:47:22] first
[1:47:24] now it was thought that in the world
[1:47:26] that he was a woman hater but in the
[1:47:29] sixth Dimension you sisters got to hug
[1:47:31] him before us brothers did you proved he
[1:47:35] wasn't a woman hater he is a true woman
[1:47:37] lover but telling them the
[1:47:41] truth so he must put and differentiate
[1:47:44] between women hugging him in life so he
[1:47:46] said he never let a woman hug him come
[1:47:48] up close to him all that sort of thing
[1:47:50] CU it could cause a sens
[1:47:53] ation he said a man even hugging his own
[1:47:56] little daughter but him being male her
[1:47:59] being female it could cause a sensation
[1:48:02] isn't that strange how the human being
[1:48:06] that is that close to a perversion you
[1:48:09] understand so whenever our our our
[1:48:12] daughters grow up you fathers know as
[1:48:13] well as I do that you still hug your
[1:48:15] daughters you still put your arm around
[1:48:17] them but you hug them in a different way
[1:48:19] than when they were little girls is that
[1:48:21] true why C that Avenue that's there in
[1:48:25] this is so close to
[1:48:28] perversion that you hug your own little
[1:48:31] daughter in the wrong way and that
[1:48:34] quickly that easily the perversion can
[1:48:37] be be this is not yet been filled with
[1:48:39] the Holy
[1:48:42] Ghost praise the
[1:48:44] Lord so when they come up and they start
[1:48:47] hugging
[1:48:48] him he notices something different now
[1:48:52] the women in form and in shape and so on
[1:48:56] our precious
[1:48:57] brother our precious
[1:49:02] brother and then they begin to Enlighten
[1:49:05] him on where he
[1:49:06] is and what he's entered into this is
[1:49:10] what you
[1:49:11] preached was the Holy
[1:49:15] Ghost now you see a preacher can preach
[1:49:17] things sometimes that he himself has not
[1:49:19] yet entered into now I preach that same
[1:49:22] thing but I'm not interdom to what he
[1:49:25] ented
[1:49:26] to why my body's not yet been
[1:49:30] changed and he said lay thus saith the
[1:49:36] Lord lay aside
[1:49:39] everything until you get into that
[1:49:43] perfect
[1:49:45] love don't you understand our souls
[1:49:49] arrive in Eden
[1:49:55] first the whole thing is the restoration
[1:49:58] and bringing it back to the Garden of
[1:50:02] Eden our souls will get there before our
[1:50:05] bodies
[1:50:06] do by the New Birth the Breath of God
[1:50:09] the same God that breathes by his mouth
[1:50:13] the beginning of the rivers of life from
[1:50:16] the mouth of
[1:50:18] God that same God did that to you when
[1:50:21] you got the Holy Ghost on your
[1:50:24] soul and you
[1:50:26] became a living
[1:50:30] Soul then you start loving and
[1:50:37] loving man car was standing yesterday
[1:50:39] and we was washing dishes
[1:50:42] together well she was washing and I was
[1:50:46] drying and I told her I said you know
[1:50:48] and I'll
[1:50:49] close when we first give our hearts to
[1:50:52] God and we get saved and God lets Trials
[1:50:54] come against us and they're of a certain
[1:50:57] strength and of a certain
[1:51:00] measure
[1:51:02] yet as we grow in God if those trials
[1:51:06] didn't
[1:51:07] intensify and become harder and more
[1:51:11] difficult then the character in us would
[1:51:13] become
[1:51:15] stunted and would we would reach a
[1:51:17] certain level and that's as far as it
[1:51:19] would go so I told her I said you know
[1:51:21] it looks like to me
[1:51:25] that we must be getting closer and
[1:51:27] closer than ever before not just the
[1:51:31] signs of the times but the intensity
[1:51:34] with the Steve of the trials we're going
[1:51:37] through but if God allowed you and tried
[1:51:39] you with something that you overcome 50
[1:51:42] years ago 40 years ago 10 years ago 12
[1:51:44] years ago would that actually make more
[1:51:47] of Christ in your
[1:51:49] character but he must let them intensify
[1:51:52] don't be
[1:51:53] discouraged by the
[1:51:56] intensification of your storms and your
[1:51:58] trials but rather let the
[1:52:01] intensifying
[1:52:03] testify God can trust you with more now
[1:52:07] than ever before
[1:52:09] amen but also know that when he gets
[1:52:12] ready sis when he gets ready the wings
[1:52:16] of heaven will come by your way and
[1:52:18] bring the Deliverance that you
[1:52:20] need and then you can look look back and
[1:52:23] say well I could have never went through
[1:52:24] that 5 years ago I could have never went
[1:52:27] through this and that and the other
[1:52:28] don't you understand it means you're
[1:52:30] growing in God and your love Satan is
[1:52:34] always questioning you the question of
[1:52:37] your
[1:52:39] life about your
[1:52:41] Christianity is your
[1:52:43] love and his love and he'll tell you he
[1:52:46] don't love you he don't care for you he
[1:52:48] don't love you you don't love him you
[1:52:50] make don't you see his whole thing it's
[1:52:54] about your love
[1:53:00] life as you believe you become love and
[1:53:03] love is God and you begin to wind
[1:53:06] yourself into Christ and these other
[1:53:09] things you don't have to quit doing them
[1:53:10] they just quit themselves there's no
[1:53:12] desire to do it the worshipper having
[1:53:14] Purge no more conscience the desire of
[1:53:16] sin Hebrews 9 the worshipper once purged
[1:53:18] you see what I mean when the worshipper
[1:53:20] is purged when he's born again when he's
[1:53:22] old nature dies and a new nature sets in
[1:53:27] then he becomes a part of God a Son of
[1:53:29] God he gets new life and the Greek word
[1:53:32] Dar zoi which means the life of God and
[1:53:35] you become an offspring of
[1:53:39] God and God cannot hurt
[1:53:43] you without hurting
[1:53:47] himself you see what I
[1:53:50] mean let to stand together let me share
[1:53:53] this one with you that I read it to you
[1:53:54] last Sunday but it is just so powerful
[1:53:58] God is a
[1:53:59] lover God is love God so loved the world
[1:54:02] when they were
[1:54:03] unlovable that he gave his
[1:54:07] son to make them
[1:54:10] lovable here it is God wants to come
[1:54:14] down and make love to you he's
[1:54:18] seeking thirsting hungering trying to
[1:54:22] get to some of your starchy Hearts to
[1:54:25] make love to you as a love affair not a
[1:54:28] law but a love it's all in love God so
[1:54:34] loved God is looking and trying and
[1:54:40] moving and
[1:54:42] begging and
[1:54:44] persuading to find a little heart that
[1:54:47] he can come
[1:54:48] into and
[1:54:50] coup and make love to him
[1:54:54] praise
[1:54:57] God can I read one more yes I have your
[1:55:00] permission you ain't goingon to get mad
[1:55:01] at me
[1:55:03] right Brothers Let's skip down to this
[1:55:05] next one I want you to notice the title
[1:55:07] of this sermon where I think Pentecost
[1:55:11] failed if it ever gets to a place that I
[1:55:14] couldn't put my arm around any brother
[1:55:17] that's working for the kingdom of God
[1:55:18] and recognize him as my brother I fear
[1:55:23] I'm
[1:55:27] backslid
[1:55:31] wow how sad it's
[1:55:34] becoming we're so
[1:55:36] divided and if we're not careful we'll
[1:55:39] disagree with this brother on that and
[1:55:41] that one on that and that one on that
[1:55:42] I'm cutting them off I ain't have
[1:55:44] nothing to do with them now that is that
[1:55:46] what brother Bram
[1:55:48] said well first cut them off from
[1:55:51] fellowship then we'll cut him off well
[1:55:53] he don't believe what the prophet said
[1:55:54] that's just the question about it he
[1:55:56] just don't believe what the prophet said
[1:55:57] he ain't no brother he ain't born of the
[1:55:59] [Music]
[1:56:03] word you see I asked y'all for your
[1:56:05] permission and you told me yeah it was a
[1:56:09] loaded gun
[1:56:11] right now you imagine brother Brenham
[1:56:13] saying that if he could not take a hold
[1:56:15] of a brother put his arm around him and
[1:56:17] recognize him as my brother I feel I'm
[1:56:20] backslid I'd be scared
[1:56:23] to stand on the
[1:56:25] platform and face evil
[1:56:28] spirits to know that I had Envy in my
[1:56:32] heart against any brother no matter who
[1:56:34] he is that's trying to preach the Gospel
[1:56:36] of Jesus Christ or live a Christian Life
[1:56:40] if we disagree a million
[1:56:46] miles now think about how sensitive we
[1:56:48] are if we know somebody we're just two
[1:56:51] miles apart on theology we won't have
[1:56:54] nothing to do with them and if it was to
[1:56:56] go 10
[1:56:57] miles I'm going to muster up all the
[1:57:00] grace I got I'm going to go 10
[1:57:04] miles what about a
[1:57:09] million disagree a million miles upon
[1:57:11] theology if he loves the Lord Jesus he's
[1:57:14] my brother and it's my sister and we've
[1:57:17] draw those lines and if you can't love
[1:57:19] your brother who you've seen how can you
[1:57:21] love God you you've never seen old
[1:57:23] brother listen this church when love
[1:57:27] goes
[1:57:28] out
[1:57:30] God goes with
[1:57:35] it I want the correct theology don't you
[1:57:38] yeah I want the correct Doctrine but
[1:57:41] also want the right Spirit
[1:57:44] right and you can never get anywhere
[1:57:47] without Divine love and as You Love
[1:57:52] one
[1:57:53] another you love
[1:57:56] God and Word of Life Church
[1:58:01] said and Word of Life Church said help
[1:58:04] me
[1:58:06] Lord help me
[1:58:10] Lord God bless you let's bow our heads
[1:58:16] together thank you Lord
[1:58:20] Jesus thank thank you Lord for your
[1:58:25] word how many of you here today just by
[1:58:28] the raising of your hand no one looking
[1:58:30] around
[1:58:31] Lord I believe what I've heard is the
[1:58:34] truth but I need help with it
[1:58:36] father I need help what's becoming what
[1:58:39] your your word says I raise my hands
[1:58:42] Lord
[1:58:45] Jesus father we do love you today you
[1:58:48] know our
[1:58:50] hearts and I want Want to Love You Lord
[1:58:53] not as Donnie Reagan thinks you want to
[1:58:56] be
[1:58:58] loved when I married my wife over 51
[1:59:02] years
[1:59:03] ago I wasn't a woman of course so I
[1:59:06] didn't think like a woman I didn't know
[1:59:07] how to love a
[1:59:10] woman so I made up in my mind as just a
[1:59:14] boy if I'm going to love her I'm going
[1:59:17] to have to understand
[1:59:19] her I'm going to have to
[1:59:22] listen when she doesn't know I'm
[1:59:26] listening I I want to have to listen
[1:59:29] to her wishes and her desires and what
[1:59:34] what she wants in life what she doesn't
[1:59:37] like in
[1:59:40] life I think you help me to do that
[1:59:43] Lord so I could be the right kind of a
[1:59:46] husband and as I look back I realize
[1:59:49] that's what you did to us
[1:59:52] so you had to become one of
[1:59:55] us to understand how could David forfeit
[1:59:59] a kingdom for adultery how could Moses
[2:00:03] be kept out of the land because of
[2:00:06] temper so you took on humanity and its
[2:00:09] Frailty and weakness to understand
[2:00:14] us the prophet gives us a little analogy
[2:00:17] of a of a
[2:00:19] story that a great king one day come to
[2:00:22] those in his court and said today you
[2:00:25] see me for your last time for quite a
[2:00:28] long time oh great king they said where
[2:00:32] will you go are you leaving
[2:00:35] us are you going somewhere else he said
[2:00:38] no no I I'll still be here but you just
[2:00:42] won't see me like
[2:00:44] this he said I want to understand my
[2:00:47] people better so I can serve them
[2:00:50] better so I want to chop wood with the
[2:00:53] wood
[2:00:54] Chopper want a plant with the
[2:00:57] planter and went through the list of
[2:00:59] things that he wanted to do so early the
[2:01:03] next morning they brought in these
[2:01:05] poppers G
[2:01:08] garments and the
[2:01:10] king the people watch as he lays aside
[2:01:13] his crown his Royal
[2:01:17] diadem and then watch him put on the
[2:01:20] clothes of a common man
[2:01:23] man and the prophet took that little
[2:01:26] analogy and said that was
[2:01:28] you you wanted to understand
[2:01:32] us so you become a man and you were
[2:01:35] tempted by women tempted by drinking
[2:01:39] tempted in all porns like we are even
[2:01:42] prayed in the garden father if it be thy
[2:01:44] will let this cup pass from
[2:01:48] me oh Jesus help us Lord
[2:01:53] I confess it before you and this people
[2:01:55] today it is not in my
[2:01:58] Humanity to love this
[2:02:01] way and I will say it about them it is
[2:02:03] not in their Humanity but that's the
[2:02:06] great thing you don't demand that we do
[2:02:08] it with our human love but with
[2:02:12] Theos and even when we receive Theos we
[2:02:15] must still die to our Humanity so the
[2:02:18] Theos can live out of
[2:02:20] us so Lord Lord God we're requesting now
[2:02:24] help us Lord no doubt many of these
[2:02:26] people have been born again they have
[2:02:28] the Holy Ghost Lord they may still
[2:02:30] battle with that old
[2:02:32] flesh but may Jesus live out of us as we
[2:02:37] get closer to the body
[2:02:39] change the prophet tells us in sort when
[2:02:42] he describes that
[2:02:43] translation he said I believe the people
[2:02:46] who go in the Rapture will be something
[2:02:49] like that before they go
[2:02:53] go Lord we got some moving up to do we
[2:02:57] got some dying to
[2:02:59] do help us Lord
[2:03:03] Jesus Oh Praise the Lord
[2:03:06] amen I want to
[2:03:11] live the
[2:03:14] way he wants me to
[2:03:19] live I want to is that your desire
[2:03:26] today there's just no
[2:03:29] more to
[2:03:31] give I want to

[2:03:55] sing it together I want to
[2:04:00] live the
[2:04:03] way he wants me to
[2:04:08] live I want to
[2:04:12] give until there's just no
[2:04:19] more to kill
[2:04:22] I want to

[2:04:57] of your body I want

[2:06:09] that it's not in us it's not in us we
[2:06:12] love the lovable and we judge people
[2:06:15] well I can love them because and then we
[2:06:18] have the list but God looked at us and
[2:06:20] said I love you so much I want to make
[2:06:24] you lovable now that he's made us
[2:06:26] lovable the war begins on who gets our
[2:06:31] love read Ezekiel 16 see what God did to
