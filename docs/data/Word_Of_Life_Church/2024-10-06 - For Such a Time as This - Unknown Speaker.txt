that we have food and that we have clothes and that I have shoes on my and and it's because God sent yall here that's that's it God sent yall here to take care of [Music] us this thing has took on a life of its own what started out was just uh Small Potatoes on Sunday evening was it yeah few here and there few about four trucks went out we said well that's probably it but as you can tell it's most roomed into uh the people that we've reached and the people that have been blessed by just somebody coming up with an idea coming up with a thought knowing somebody that needed something we're getting stuff in we got a a horse trailer sitting here right now that was loaded from front to back from over in Kentucky to uh what we've seen the Lord do is just somebody stepping up and helping somebody in need we're so blessed to be part of this uh this assembly and have the blessings of our pastor and and the congregation to do what's been done the the SES we've seen the homes that we've seen washed away Vehicles washed away you SUVs turned on their sides washed away but still yet the things we've took to people and the things we have been a part of is stuff that people will never ever get over is there appreciation is it's unmatched is it it really is [Music] [Applause] morning for the hurry he's not s in a long time his voice is still uh not 100% but he's going to start Us in

that restores them again they do not need a judge they need a friend who will be Jesus to them thank the Lord thank the Lord amen well I just want to say how proud I am of all of you Carol and I'm all that you've been doing this week each one in their own way and their own ability to be able to do something um it's such a terrible terrible time for so many of these people and if we can help them a little bit get through it and as you saw from the videos some of the people weren't dressed the way we believe in dressing no doubt they believe all kinds of different things than what we believe but what I look at is a human being in a great desperate need yeah so we're not there to pass out tracks and teach him about serpy but if they can see Jesus none of us can do even what Dolly pardon done she took $2 million from her personal account not her corporations plural $2 million to somebody like that ain't nothing all kinds of different people are helping but we want to help with the touch of Jesus right yeah amen let's um read today from The Book of Matthew chapter 14 Matthew chapter 14 verse4 and Jesus went forth and saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion toward them and healed their sick I wonder how many of them people were actually what we would call message Believers in that day sometimes looking at the disciples you wonder how many of them they were they didn't understand what the message was about did they they didn't have the Holy Ghost but what I love about him is that he didn't look out and sort him out now he could look and know this one is this one ain't this one is this one ain't all of you that are stand on this side all of you that ain't stand over on this side will help you but we won't help you he causes the sun to shine upon the just and the unjust and the rain as well I love the way Matthew writes this and he says that he saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion toward them now remember the prophet tells us that compassion is not human sympathy compassion is doing the will of God a lot of these people that's doing a lot of things they're doing they're doing it out of human compassion I'm glad we still got some humans that have a little bit of compassion aren't you but we want to do it with some mix mixture of human sympathy but compassion finding the will of God and he healed their sick and when it was evening his disciples came to him saying this is a desert place and the time is now passed send the multitude away now in one way you think I understand where they were coming from to a degree but we're in a desert okay that we're not Walmarts down the road targets we're in the desert but the disciples said just get rid of them send them away I pray we're not like that not only just in flood time but anytime this is a desert place in the time has now passed send the multitude away that they may go into the villages and buy themselves victuals but Jesus said unto them they need not depart give you them to eat now you imagine them looking at one another and thinking he is so weird he is so strange are you kid kiding me multitudes now remember there were 5,000 men but historians and theologian say that was on the masculine number that they gave that the crowd would have been between 15 to 20,000 time you add the women and the children 15 to 20,000 starving people and Jesus tells them give ye them to eat Esther chapter 4 verse 14 and from here's what I'd like to speak to you today on for if thou alt together holdest thy peace at this time then shall there be enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place but thou in thy father's house shall be destroyed now remember Mori is speaking to Esther and who knoweth whether Thou Art come to the kingdom for such a time as this that's what I want to speak to you about this morning such a time as this how many has a request on your heart today something you'd like to the Lord to be mindful of I like for us also to remember Sister Susanna Wade Holmes and her children have had a very traumatic thing to happen in their family yesterday and they certainly need our prayers and help and uh just hold them in your heart if you would Lord Jesus we bow our heads before you today with Thanksgiving once again that we can come to this place that you've given us and Lord as I walked around here yesterday and so all the things that was going on and all the food and water lined up our entryways on both sides and all the things that are here to reach out to the needy during this time and I thought once again our new facility is being a blessing to so many people and again I want to thank you for giving it to us had we been over it at our other church we couldn't have done any of this hardly but if we follow you and we please you then you'll prove that you're with us Lord so we want to use these things wisely Lord God I I pray that you'd help each of us that we can be Jesus speak to us today from your word father we pray in Jesus name and the saint said amen amen God bless you you may be seated I realize I'm speaking to an international audience today maybe some of you are wondering um what we have been doing and a terrible hurricane came through our way last week brought torrential rains delude in some places and as um devastated many of the surrounding communities and and our region I was talking to brother Fred Mullins last night and he was asking me how many people in our church had their homes destroyed and I told him none how many people in your church lost their life said none so he said why are you all doing this he said I I'd heard that it started because of the needs of your own people I said no it actually didn't have anything to do with the needs of our people it started a week ago Sunday when one of the brothers of our church had a man that he works with and knew that there was a a real dire need and it went from a couple of different Brothers trying to reach out to help somebody get out from where that they were separated from everybody else so it started from there and then it's exploded into what it is today and as I begin to hear about some of these things and been contacted by people from different states and different parts of the world about what's going on and people wanting to help and as I said it several times in the last few days times like this bring out the best in people but it can also bring out the worst in others because some people look at this as an opportunity to Rob to steal some people look at it as a photo op so their picture can go on here or there there social media or YouTube or whatever um we're not interested in any of that as a matter of fact I I wouldn't care if nobody ever knew that our church existed during this time frame because we're not here so that we could draw attention somehow to ourself for those of you that have given up your time I know some of you taken off work some of you have spent only God knows how much the brothers have spent of their own money buying fuel buying diesel fuel gasoline taking off of work all that you've done all that you've contributed I want to say from all of my heart thank you so much for what you've done and then somehow it exploded to where other people heard about it we've been getting uh cont contributions from California from Ohio from Indiana from all over Tennessee all over everywhere you know how in the world has it come you think I'm not really sure but as I've been thinking about it and praying about it this week I I begin to realize that God has allowed us to be in this particular moment amen now had we tried to orchestrate this so that somehow we could get something out of it uh none of us here are politicians or I hope or not anyway so none of us are running for an office uh we're certainly not want to be Governor mayor president vice president nothing like that so we're just Desiring to help human beings in this time of of great need and hopefully the Lord will help me this morning that maybe I can bring something from the scripture and something also from the message that'll help us to see a portion of the third pool that maybe you've never looked at before since most of the time we think about the third pool being great phenomenal and great Supernatural and you know this particular man speaking the word and this and this but brother Andrew Glover sent me a quote the other day and I I just thought it was absolutely astounding let us go back to the account that Matthew gives in Matthew chap 14: 16 we'll read it again but Jesus said unto them they need not depart give ye them to eat and they say unto him we have here but Five Loaves and two fishes now the critics of this miracle say that the loaves were bigger in that day so to feed 15 to 20,000 I mean them loaves that have to be from here to Johnson City long wouldn't they and I mean a beluga whale wouldn't be big enough but remember John tells us in his account of this a little boy took it for lunch I mean I know little boys have got a bottomless pit sometimes but I ain't never seen a little boy with a lunch basket that big but there's a few groups that we want to look at today I want to look at that little boy first of all we don't know his name we don't know what class that he came out of being a Jew was he a Pharisee a sadducee a herodian John mentions nothing about any of that but he just calls him a lad so here's this little lad he's just going on his everyday thinging the prophet kind of dramatizes it a little bit so the little boy was actually skipping school playing trins out of school so here's a big crowd he thinks he can get lost in the school and maybe mama will never find out but I personally think God had it orchestrate oh yeah you see as long as that little boy had them Loaves and Fishes it would be a boy's lunch and maybe a you know a little bit of a snack later in the day but in Jesus hands oh amen and they say unto him we have here but Five Loaves and two fishes and he said bring them thither to me now we get another person in view we have the little boy we have the disciples and now we have the miracle worker the little boy nor the disciples could work miracles with this bread and this is what we want to keep before us in all that we're doing how long would this last I don't know another week two three I don't have a clue but I know the Lord Jesus wants us in all that we do to keep him first yeah amen and remember with all the good that is being done as your pastor let me warn you Satan will love to come in and divide or separate or difference of opinion on administrative Avenues or this or that or the other don't let him do that don't let the devil do that let God continue to use us well brother Don what about when it's over when it's over we will just say thank God it's done praise the Lord these people have been helped and then we'll continue to go on and hopefully there won't be no more tragedies we've got to do now I don't mind telling you that as I've been thinking about this thing this week and my mind has fast forwarded in time to the Great Tribulation period what has happened in Western North Carolina in Tennessee in Florida in Virginia and different places that have been hit by this terrible thing I'm telling you friends are nothing compared to what's fixing to be turned loose that's right in this earth am and as a servant of God I'm telling you you don't want to be left here because there won't be one Holy Ghost filled child of God to be here to bring you comfort right we want to be ready to leave this world so the little lad must hear it rumored that Jesus has told the disciples we got to help these people so he brings his lunch to them and Jesus said he said bring them thither to me and he commanded the multitude to set down on the grass and took the Five Loaves and the two fishes looking up to heaven that it amazing before things can be multiplied properly for the dispersion of the saints of God we must not look to FEMA we must not look to Washington here you go here you go and looking up to heaven he blessed and break for those of you that wasn't here yesterday and the rest of the week that's what's been going on out here as I walked in and I saw a well oiled machine I saw people running around with pads and iPads and ink pens and pencils and you do this and you do that and you do that you know what I come to the conclusion whenever I saw this you all don't need me any longer so I think I'm about ready to retire but I saw water an all awesome thing you know you got this one that can do that and this one that can do that and another one that can do this brothers that can drive trucks and deliver and go up and do all of this it was just absolutely awesome to see it was just as if though we had been trained for years listen that was as if the though we had been trained disciplined taught for years oh yeah I hope you're not blind today we have been I said we have been how could this be well first of all we look up to heaven and he blessed and Brak now watch and gave the loaves to his disciples so the little boy renders to the disciples in the unmultiplied form they get it all together they keep records of it okay so they had a record they know how many they had we got Five Loaves and two fishes now I told brother Michael in their discourse in the last few days brother Michael I want pictures taken of this stuff we want to be accountable for what people are trusting us with right we want to be accountable so we want to keep a record we want to have pictures so people can can be able to say hey what are these people doing with the water we're giving them what are they doing with the food what are they doing with the money that we're giving them okay I want that so we can be able if anybody ever wants to come back and say hey what did you all do with this money or with these contributions we can show them can we not so here the disciples had an accurate count of how many cases of water that they' received oh yeah and how many fish they had and how many loaves and all of that and then they're going to disperse it so who is going to disperse it the disciples not Jesus we got any disciples here today and gave the loaves to the disciples and the disciples to the multitude don't you love the way God works now they couldn't do the miracle the apostles couldn't do the fish nor the breath that was the little boy's part isn't it amazing how God incorporates so many people now wonder if this little boy ever wrote a book about this about his life and it was a first century bestseller and he went around with photo ops and I'm the little boy I'm the little boy look at what I done neither are we interested in such but if God can use us to help somebody amen but brother Donnie what if they never come to the word that'll be just fine if they can't come to this word when you and I stand before the Lord Jesus at that day and he looks at us and says you were my hands you were my feet to show the multitude in North Carolina and Tennessee and here and there and there there is still a loving merciful god and let me just resolve this for you today in case you're wondering the Lord Jesus never calls this hurricane no he does not do such it was the prince of the power of the air but the Lord Jesus knew it was coming and he said but this is what I'm fixing to do I'm fixing to put my mercy and my love on display oh I love talking to an invisible God I love praying to an invisible God but I don't mind tell you there are times in my life I need a god with skin on him hallelujah hallelujah and they did all eat and were filled and they took up of the fragments that remained 12 basketful now here they've taken care of the the hunger and all that they're going through and you think and the Lord Jesus actually made more than what they needed so reckon what they done put it in the dumpster wonder what they done brother Daryl with what was left over I don't believe Jesus will put more in our hands on what there will be a need for but you see this is for man if man isn't careful then he goes to looking at what's left over and then you'll say oh wait wait wait a what What About Us then maybe we'll get a little something out of this no it's nothing about us getting anything out of this I want no glory anybody here want Glory shame on you if you do we want no glory we want no recognition we want him to get all the glory amen thank God for the little boys on the internet the little girls on the internet in California wherever they are they're putting loaves in our hands they're putting fishes in our hands thank God for every one of you my brother Michael been keeping me updated on the numbers of this and that over 600 meals prepared out of our kitchen to be able to go feed these people sisters as the pastor I want to thank you cuz I know you had to take time from your families oh my notice in verse 21 and they that had eaten were about 5,000 men beside women and children so 15 to 20,000 people fed with a little boy's lunch praise the Lord read with me in Matthew chapter 20 verse 25 James and John's mother had come to Jesus and I remember their father was Zebedee we don't scripturally know what her name was but she had come to Jesus asking for a favor and Jesus said what would you and she he said I want my two boys to have a favored position in your kingdom I want one of them on the left and I want the other one on the right now can you imagine how the Lord Jesus must have felt when she asked this this is his response Jesus now confronts James and John you can read it verse 22 23 24 but to save time but Jesus called them unto him and said ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them look at what the word dominion means to be Lord over exercise lordship over to bring under one's power to subdue or Master now watch Jesus chooses his words wisely listen to these next few words you know the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them that they that they that are great exercise Authority upon them but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister now this is the word the Greek word that we get the word Deacon from deonas look at the meaning of this one one who executes the commands of others now can't you see why God was so against that nickan thing in the first age at the end of that age when it goes into that and they go to electing Bishops and all types of overseers and archbishops and all this and that and the other and they're the big men and they tell everybody else what to do and they don't do nothing Jesus said that's not the way it's going to be in my kingdom now some people have that mentality we know notice this word it says one who by the virtue of the office assigned to him by the church cares for the poor and has charge of and distributes the money collected for their use wow another phrase of the meaning of this word is a waiter one who serves food and drink do you understand part of the ministry of the son of man sir was not to be ministered to but to minister to others right I wonder how close we are to the coming of the Lord if God can subject our ideas of where the great Queen and where the this and that and the other to humility and [Music] servitude even to those that no doubt some of them will research our church after this is all said and done and they'll think oh my goodness I didn't know them people's a bunch of rits oh my goodness I didn't know they believe this and that and the other we're not handing out bromite water the Cheerios are not boxed by brandom mites it's General meals and we're not brandom mites in no way we're Christians but we do follow the message of that Prophet well praise the Lord we're done opening the boxes of all this stuff and putting in Brandon my pills and then once they get a bite of cereal they become an instant brandom out we're trying to feed them we're trying to shelter them we'll get them blankets we'll buy coats for them we'll do whatever we can do to help them why cuz that's who we are our name is eser come on now yes amen Lord Jesus and whosoever will be Chief among you let him be your servant even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many brothers those of you that's in these delivery routes you see the looks that comes upon some of these people's faces they may think in their mind they'll never see you again but they will you sisters that are cooking you that are dividing all this stuff as it comes in here there and there as how sure yesterday I said Brothers tell me what what can I do so well there's a truck here you can help unload that so I'm not there to unload it and you hear we were unloading myself and brother Daniel Willis unloading Garden sprayers and I'm thinking killing weeds isn't that going to be the farthest thing from these people Minds I said brother Daniel why why would they donate this he said brother Donnie they're filling them up with water some of them that have black paint or spraying paint on them setting it out in the sun in the black will draw the Heat and they're taking showers with a garden sprayer and those of us that were without electricity for a couple days we thought the world was coming to an end we couldn't drink ice make ice out of our ice maker and we thought we was not going to be able to make it did we we're a spoil rotten bunch of people sometimes so an aspect of the son of man's Ministry was not that everybody would be running to him and serving him but rather that he would serve them I wonder my friends could this be part of the crowning of the Bride around the world not just this particular incident but that we will come into that phase remember it's not too long after this that our Lord goes to Calvary and remember one of the last great things that he did was bow before the feet of his disciples God washing his disciples feet and their idea of greatness must be destroyed help us Jesus Galatians chapter 6 verse 10 as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all that come to our church and then we might be able to reach out beyond our church and maybe a couple of more message churches in the area what's the Bible say Sinners wow let us do good unto all men now but I love the way Paul phrases this especially especially unto them who are of the household of faith but I was overwhelmed yesterday when I looked at this word opportunity I don't ever remember looking it up before maybe I have but the word is opportunity is season or Due Time a measure of time the time listen this word the time when things are brought to crisis wow I mean it's like I just got this letter in the mail yesterday you know and it's just right here you say God how perfect you are praise God the time when things are brought to crisis the decisive so when the opportunity arises Brother D does that mean we've not been helping people before oh no we've helped people around the world for decades absolutely decades but you know what it was like the Lord wanted to get us an opportunity what we wouldn't just send money overseas and money to Africa money to India you see you don't know it but you've helped drill water wells in Africa in India in different parts of the world and the brothers will ask me brother Donnie can we open this up to the entire Village and I say by all means you've helped with medicine in Vietnam you've helped with all kinds of things oh I'm just giving you a little bit of clue of what you're going to be rewarded for at the day of judgment we've helped but God wanted to let us I believe be a part of our own region thank the Lord I said thank the Lord amen hallelujah and no I don't want my picture on the front page of the Johnson City Press I've done been there and done that I didn't like the last results I my sermons have already been all over the Tri Cities I'm not interested in that happening again I don't care if nobody knows we ever exist as long as Jesus is pleased with the way we conduct ourself during this time and if he has dropped this opportunity in our lap I say we sees it and we do everything he wants us to do oh my now I know that people are posting all kinds of different things and I I want people to know where their money's going things like that but we we never want to focus on us when you post things you include those people who's made it possible so far we haven't had to take any money from the church it's all been funded so far from people everywhere I believe when God starts a work and establishes a work God will help him we've never had to raise one dime of money or ask any other churches to help pay for our church pay for our building praise the Lord there's people that sent money but I don't I just don't I I'm going to go that way I don't think I have to but I don't care one bit and standing up and asking an offering for somebody else I guarantee you that and we've not even had to we've not even had to pull for money and we know how churches have that recck you know the people looking that oh yeah they're always out for money well that ain't us well a lot of preachers I've known but that ain't this preacher and whenever you post things don't just mention our church has done this and our church has done that and our church be sure and include but people from here and there and there and there are working with us and you know what they've done many of these people they don't know us from Adam they do not know us at all right they don't know us so we do not want to let the Lord Jesus down in the way we represent him amen so just be careful when you're posting things and you know just don't make it sound like that we're tooting our own horn let the Lord toot our horn if he wants it tooted somebody said Amen Let Me Close Your momentarily brother Brandon and dealing with Ruth and he talks about the four stages of Ruth and he says Ruth's deciding making her decision Ruth serving Ruth resting Ruth rewarded as we come back Ruth making the decision Ruth after made her decision then Ruth is serving then roseth is resting then roseth is rewarded you know I think friends that if we after this and we say you know what this is a great thing maybe we should start making this a part of our church that we do this all the time and you see that's when we get in trouble yeah that's right because we think boy we were so successful we were just no no we we will be here and if the Lord whatever the Lord wants us to do praise the Lord for that but we want opportunity Divine opportunity and if the Lord allows it to happen again we'll do it again so what lessons are we going to learn out of what we're dealing with right now the Lord Jesus cares for all these people out here and I know I know I know there's some of you and you're looking say oh Lord have mercy you know we're breaking protocol oh this ain't going on this is a time of crisis in protocol everything probably ain't going to go by our rules that we made up but don't worry if time goes on we'll get back to the rules amen for some of you worry warts that are worried to death about the rules we still have the rules on the sign over there and we'll get back to him but in the time of emergency you have to kind of just do what you got to do to get it all leveled out I don't imagine any of those hungry people want to send a state inspector over to look our kitchen over you reckon you reckon they want to send anybody in to inspect our sisters and say I want to go to your house and see how clean your house is now Sister sure be clean do everything you can do to be respectful and prepare the meals and all that sort of thing but I dare say if I was hungry I could just about eat a Pome or a I mean I ain't never done it before but I figure if you get hungry enough you could do it so we want to keep it all in perspective but the main thing is this that it don't have to be run your way or your way or your way or your way cuz all of us have our own way but what we want to do is focus on the main need of the hour let's do what we can do help these poor people get settled back again praise the lord it's evident from our FEMA deal and all that they've done give a bunch of our money away from people that didn't even deserve it in the first place and now our citizens which have paid taxes for all these years they're leaving them high and dry come on well come on now I ain't running for president I don't have a dog in this race but I do think it's a crying shame whenever our own people are in need but the Lord Jesus is mindful of them thank God there's still some citizens in this nation that are willing to do what they need to do to help people listen this I'll close with this the prophet said God by a vision has told told me that my Ministry is making its Third change and I'm longing for it to begin here at the Tabernacle I don't know whether it will or not but I'm longing for it to do that and I trust it'll be some way that I'll be able to preach the gospel in such a way or do something that will help some suffering Humanity to be a happier way of life and a more healthier way of life it's my sincere desire wow so you mean the third phase of his ministry was not just about deep Min Min Mysteries and preachers being Lords over God's Heritage and arguing and debating over this point of Doctrine it was to help suffering Humanity Word of Life Church God is giving us an opportunity do we want to fulfill this quote and our portion we will never do we it's not our part remember much of this is the prophet's third pull it ain't mine no way it don't belong to no other preachers it's his but we're coming under the influence of that this was the desire of our messenger it was not to make a cult it was not to make a clan and make us weird and different and for us to walk around with a know stuck up in the air that we're better than these people and all of that sort of stff no wonder he said he prayed that God would help the doctors to find a cure for cancer why he loved Humanity Brother Don you afraid you'll love him too much well I'll tell you what if you want to find me guilty of something I pray all the evidence acts against me in that way that I was guilty of loving too much I was guilty of giving people a second chance I'm so glad we serve a God today who is a god of Second Chances not only second but sometimes third and fourth and fifth and sixth let's B our heads together for who knoweth whether Thou Art come to the kingdom for such a time as this those of you in India those of you in Africa those of you in Europe Iceland Greenland Finland Norway wherever you are around the world may the Lord God help each of you as the Bride Comes To Her Last Days upon the Earth May the ministry of the son of man Christ Jesus be so repeated in our lives that the last witness left to the Earth will not be necessarily joining this church and joining another message church but Jesus being alive Jesus in flesh upon the Earth no doubt some of these people that'll be helped by us they'll they'll find out about who we are and what we believe and some of them may make a YouTube video against us and all this and that and the other that don't make no difference we would go right back and help them again cuz that's who we are that's why Jesus could look from the cross remember where he was at when he said these words father forgive them for they know not what they do from what view from what angle from The Cross by now that crown of Victor's Thorns had been pressed down upon his head his head would have been swollen about the size of a wash bucket his lips would have been so swollen he was so thirsty at the loss of blood his heart rate going up and down his blood pressure oh to hear I read it not long ago of a medical doctor that took the crucifixion and went through it from a medical standpoint it was just horrifying but still he is the god of mercy so he looks not from a throne as it were a diadem in his hand a great purple robe but naked blood streaming down his body bar able to talk his mind rushed with pain and Agony and sorrow but he looked upon those who crucified Him Father forgive them for they don't know what they're doing oh we've typified the bride leaving in the world in a great Crescendo of Glory the bride doing this or that I wonder sometimes wonder if it won't be a mixture of many different aspects of Christ Jesus our lord that we forgive those who spoke against us pray for those who' despitefully used us your last deed before the Rapture may not be helping a message person it might be a poor wretched sinner in the very next day hail stones will be falling out of Heaven weighing a 100 lbs a piece and not violating the inhabitants upon the Earth but your last human work was something for the cause of the Lord Jesus hallelujah how many he wants to be more like him today just raise your hand to him I'm sure my friends that I have missed many opportunities and I hope you don't think I'm presuming by saying probably every everybody here has missed opportunities to let people see there is a God who's alive and well we know how politics works if it's a photo op that'll help you if it's not they don't care but we want to be Jesus not during this time of chaos but every day of our life Lord Jesus as we bow our heads to the dust of the earth father and our hearts certainly break for what has hit our region Lord and we certainly here today are not here to look down upon any of the other churches and the Tri Cities I I don't know what any of them are doing no doubt they're helping in different ways but we're not here to compare with this one that one the other one that's not the way we focus Lord we just want to do what you've placed in our hands we pray that you would help us to serve you Faithfully during this time I pray God that you would help each of those that have been working here tirelessly Lord I know that brother Michael told me the other day uh 14 16 hours some of them been putting in Lord and I just pray father that you'd strengthen them I pray for the brothers Lord that are making these deliveries out in these communities help them lord they're seeing things experiencing things Lord that I'm sure is overwhelming dear God would you help them to know if they reach a spot that they need to take a little break from it because they're just getting overwhelmed a human being is only made to take so much trauma so much pain so much heartache so much suffering help my brothers Lord the sisters working all of them our youths I saw little children here yesterday and just trying to pack stuff and move stuff and just do what they can do I thought what a great thing that's what we want to instill in our children not to live a selfish life not to live a life that's just all about us no doubt they'd rather had their Saturday going somewhere and spending time together doing this or that but instead of doing that they wanted to be here doing something they could to help these people that they'll never even meet more than likely in this life help us Jesus whenever we send our last bottle water our last box of cereal has left our fellowship hall the last generator the last battery we go to sweeping it all up we look around and everything is gone and we breathe the sigh of relief and say praise the lord we want you to be pleased with what we've done we want you to be pleased with the way the sisters have behaved the way they've conducted themselves I know events like this can actually cause people to come together that haven't even been on speaking terms and yet all of a sudden that don't seem to matter no more but I pray when things like this past that we don't revert back to our non-speaking terms but we let it be something that'll be a remedy for us we're not asking for a blessing Lord but we know it's your law you'll bless us for our effort but right now we're not concerned about blessing we're concerned for strength wisdom Lord help my brothers as they go out to be Alik May these people feel the presence of Jesus I've seen many different videos of people from Spring Hill Tennessee and people from Samaritans Pur and people from here and there and there and we're so grateful for every one of them Carol and I saw about 10 or 12 pickup trucks yesterday coming out on South Rome we saw it before we come to the church it was wled there was gas cans there was all kinds of things and I told her I said oh no I hope they ain't going to the church church but sure enough we got behind them and they they passed and I said praise the Lord little did I realize there only truckloads more to come later but Lord it made me feel good people want to help one another I pray You' bless every one of them for that effort so we don't want to just be another pickup with a bottle of water but when my brother's feet hit the ground made the presence of the Lord yes be able to witness Lord and if there's any of that needs prayer and they sense it they're so down and so despondent these types of things make people want to take their life may my brothers be able to be sensitive and if they need to pray for them offer a word of prayer we believe we've been called for a mission the last call for the table to be filled with the sick the halt the lame the crippled help us Jesus to fulfill our part in this and may we not stop here oh Jesus may we be closer together as a body all the preachers that have contacted me Lord all the brothers from around the world churches that have sent money would you bless them Father Grant it we pray Lord God in Jesus name can we stand together when he was on the
