[40:38] [Applause]
[40:48] praise the Lord
[40:50] well if that's not our determination
[40:52] we're done whooped anyway
[40:54] we've got to be more determined than
[40:56] we've ever been before by the grace of
[40:58] God
[40:59] Satan will try everything he can to stop
[41:02] us
[41:03] and if you're stoppable you will be
[41:05] stopped
[41:07] but if you can't be stopped ended up
[41:09] Devil's out of hell
[41:10] yeah there ain't enough people there
[41:12] ain't even enough angels to stop you
[41:14] because you're unstoppable
[41:17] praise the Lord
[41:20] amen
[41:22] oh I was so happy man they said unto us
[41:25] let us go into the house of the Lord God
[41:28] bless you let's turn together tonight if
[41:30] you would the first Samuel chapter 15
[41:33] verse 17. are you happy to be in the
[41:35] house of God
[41:38] let's read this together
[41:41] and Samuel said when that was little
[41:46] and thine own sight
[41:48] was thou not made the head of the tribes
[41:50] of Israel
[41:51] and the Lord Anointed The King over
[41:53] Israel and the Lord sent thee on a
[41:55] journey and said go and utterly destroy
[41:57] the Sinners the amalekites and fight
[42:00] against them until they be consumed
[42:03] wherefore then did US thou not obey the
[42:07] voice of the Lord
[42:09] but did us fly upon the soul the spoil
[42:11] into this evil and the sight of the Lord
[42:15] and Saul said unto Samuel yea
[42:19] I have obeyed the voice of the Lord
[42:25] so we got the prophet saying one thing
[42:27] and when God saw saying something
[42:29] different
[42:31] and apparently it's totally convinced
[42:32] that he did
[42:34] well I'll tell you the most deceiving
[42:36] thing that there is in the world is the
[42:39] human heart
[42:41] yours
[42:43] and mine
[42:44] that's right
[42:46] a lot of us can catch people when
[42:48] they're trying to deceive us but our
[42:50] greatest deception we have to watch out
[42:52] for is US
[42:54] Jeremiah said who can know the heart you
[42:56] know it's the truth
[42:58] notice what he says whenever he says
[43:01] this and Saul said unto Samuel hey I
[43:03] have obeyed the voice of the Lord and
[43:05] have gone the way
[43:06] which the Lord sent me and have brought
[43:08] agag the king of amalek and have utterly
[43:12] destroyed the amalekites
[43:16] let's pray together
[43:19] Heavenly Father we love you tonight
[43:21] we're thankful Lord Jesus for your word
[43:23] we thank you for your presence that we
[43:25] feel your lord tonight thank you and the
[43:28] Psalms and in the worship
[43:30] it's awesome to be in your presence
[43:33] Lord God we thank you for that it's
[43:36] life-changing and the word We Believe
[43:38] It's Not only life-changing but after a
[43:41] while it's going to be body changing
[43:43] we thank you for the opportunity that we
[43:46] can be gathered here and we pray for
[43:48] each one that's here we pray for those
[43:50] who would love to be and cannot be here
[43:52] many different ones dealing with
[43:54] sicknesses and things in their bodies
[43:56] and Lord we just called her the requests
[43:59] before your father were certainly
[44:02] feeling burdened for brother Daryl and
[44:04] Lord God he's prayed for many of us
[44:06] whenever we've been sick and going
[44:08] through things and we want to pray for
[44:10] him tonight Lord I know father is back
[44:13] has been so bad this time lord and
[44:16] father even told me today he was having
[44:18] to crawl because he was in so much pain
[44:21] standing upright so he's been having to
[44:24] get down on his hands and knees and
[44:25] crawl but I pray the spirit of God would
[44:28] move for our brother in the name of
[44:30] Jesus may this thing leave him Lord dear
[44:34] God so many needs and requests and we're
[44:36] just asking that you would take care of
[44:38] them all tonight father so speak to us
[44:40] from your word may we be benefited as
[44:43] we've gathered here tonight in the name
[44:45] of the Lord Jesus we ask it amen God
[44:48] bless you Saints you may be seated
[44:52] you know one of the greatest battles
[44:54] that you'll ever have in Life or I'll
[44:56] ever have in life
[44:57] is being able to find our position
[45:01] and then once we find it staying in it
[45:05] it may seem simple to you well we just
[45:08] find what we're supposed to do and it
[45:09] ain't no big deal but when you really
[45:11] look at it it's one of the greatest
[45:13] battles of life you see the reason that
[45:17] God so desires for us is his people to
[45:20] find our position and stay therein is
[45:23] because that's the very opposite of what
[45:25] Satan's program was in the very
[45:28] beginning Lucifer was not as we know him
[45:32] today of course he was the light bringer
[45:34] Day star a couple different synonyms are
[45:37] the meaning of his name and he was not
[45:40] created the devil he was not created
[45:42] Satan but he was created Lucifer but he
[45:46] he got out of his position out of his
[45:49] place now what what happened when he got
[45:51] out of his place he was not happy being
[45:54] out of his place by himself so he went
[45:57] over in the north side of heaven and he
[45:59] started preaching to a bunch of angels
[46:02] now remember they'd never sinned they
[46:03] never stole they'd never done anything
[46:05] wrong in their existence we don't even
[46:07] know how long they live up to this time
[46:10] might have been he owns of Ages it might
[46:12] have been hundreds of thousands of years
[46:14] and they was righteous before God and
[46:17] they praise God and they worshiped him
[46:19] and they loved him that's what they were
[46:21] made to do but Satan began to preach to
[46:23] them one out of his position begin to
[46:27] preach to others to try to pull them out
[46:30] of their position so then these angels
[46:33] left their position so every devil that
[46:36] we fight every demon Spirit Out of Hell
[46:39] at one time was an angel of God they
[46:43] were holy they were righteous they were
[46:45] pure they were sinless they worshiped
[46:48] God they even loved God they served God
[46:51] and serve God's purpose for a time but
[46:53] then they left their position what
[46:56] happens when he brings it on the earth
[46:58] then he comes and he gets inside the
[47:01] thing that was the closest to the man
[47:03] which was the serpent had a place for a
[47:06] soul but didn't have a soul so he talks
[47:09] him out of his place he submits his body
[47:13] to the devil Satan steps inside this
[47:17] body and he wants to use this body for
[47:20] what reason to get somebody else out of
[47:23] their place which was who Eve so what
[47:26] did he do he talked her out of her
[47:29] position once he got her out of her
[47:32] place she was not satisfied being out of
[47:35] her position so she wanted to get
[47:37] somebody else out of their position now
[47:40] you realize that's exactly what Satan
[47:42] wants to do to all of us as the people
[47:45] of God he'll never be happy by getting
[47:47] one person in the church out of their
[47:49] place but he'll want to get that one and
[47:52] that one and that one and this one and
[47:53] that one same thing in the family Satan
[47:56] will never be happy and satisfied by
[47:58] just saying getting a father out of his
[48:01] position but he'll want to get the
[48:02] father he'll want to get the mother
[48:04] he'll want to get his son he'll want to
[48:06] get a daughter he'll want to get a
[48:07] granddaughter why Satan loves to pull
[48:10] people out of their position why because
[48:13] he knows it tears everything around that
[48:18] individual totally completely apart and
[48:22] it will turn their whole world as it
[48:24] were upside down so whenever Satan found
[48:28] this in the beginning and he saw the
[48:30] consequence that it brought so he could
[48:33] never make God turn against his son he
[48:37] could never make God do anything in the
[48:40] form of judgment against his son but if
[48:44] it could ever get his son and his
[48:46] daughter out of their position that
[48:49] would force the hand of God to do
[48:52] something that Satan wanted God to do
[48:54] all along but he couldn't make God do
[48:57] that himself but if he could talk the
[49:00] son and daughter into doing it then it
[49:03] would bring a penalty from God upon
[49:07] their lives now you know that God did
[49:09] not want to drive them out of the Garden
[49:11] of Eden it broke his heart it made God
[49:14] feel no doubt I absolutely just so torn
[49:18] apart and the prophet said he couldn't
[49:20] even stand in himself if they were not
[49:22] going to be in the Garden of Eden he
[49:24] didn't even want to be there himself so
[49:27] when Adam and Eve left guess what God
[49:30] vacated the garden himself and God has
[49:33] never been back as a matter of fact the
[49:36] Garden of Eden has been lost it was in
[49:38] the land of Egypt and they've never
[49:40] found it to this day why the garden is
[49:43] not a garden without God's children
[49:45] being there he knows what it's like to
[49:48] be alone and he ain't going to be alone
[49:50] again so how important is it then that
[49:54] every one of us beginning with me being
[49:56] the pastor of the church every Deacon
[49:58] ever trustee every member of the church
[50:01] ever song leader every musician all of
[50:04] those that hold offices every one of us
[50:06] to find our position now as a child of
[50:09] God your position has many aspects first
[50:12] of all you're in Christ Jesus as an
[50:15] individual in Christ Jesus you stand
[50:18] alone you have your own baptism of the
[50:21] Holy Ghost you have your own walk you
[50:23] have your own disposition and the
[50:25] spiritual economy of God but then you're
[50:27] not in Christ alone in the sense that he
[50:30] has a mystical body then he has a local
[50:34] body and then you find your place in
[50:37] that body and there if you're a singer
[50:39] you sing if you're a piano player you
[50:41] play if you're a deacon you do what a
[50:44] Deacon's supposed to do and Satan will
[50:46] fight you from the time you find your
[50:48] place until the day you're dead to try
[50:52] to get you out of that position anybody
[50:55] going to preach with me tonight but I
[50:57] believe there's one of the scriptures of
[50:59] the people of God that was prophesied in
[51:02] The Book of Joel and it is a prophecy of
[51:06] the last day and it was about a mighty
[51:10] Army that would rise in the last day and
[51:14] one of the great significant senses of
[51:16] this Army was they would not break their
[51:20] ranks now notice this is a prophetic
[51:23] utterance of the last day of the army of
[51:27] God so every member will be in Christ
[51:30] and they will be in the body where God
[51:33] positions them and they will not break
[51:36] the ring now he understands what that
[51:38] means breaking your Reign so it would be
[51:41] as if though that we would take it safe
[51:43] from the natural sense of our military
[51:45] then a man would be will say a five-star
[51:49] general well a guy that just come in the
[51:52] Army last week There's no way that he's
[51:54] going to be able to break Rank and say
[51:56] you know what I'm tired of being about
[51:58] private I don't nobody recognizes me and
[52:02] my pay is right on the bottom I'm and
[52:04] I'm as low as you can go there ain't
[52:06] nobody lower than me except the dog I
[52:08] saw I turned the parking lot everybody
[52:10] else in here is above me and I'm tired
[52:12] of it so I'm going to be a five-star
[52:15] general I want when I come around for
[52:17] people to salute me I want them to say
[52:20] sir I want them to this and that and the
[52:22] other I'm fixing to break my ring no
[52:25] what you're fixing to do is get your
[52:27] nose broke because they're fixing to
[52:30] discipline you like you have never had a
[52:32] whooping in your life because you're not
[52:35] fit you're not qualified to go from a
[52:39] week in the Army to being a five-star
[52:41] general somebody say Amen well you see
[52:44] it's the same way in the army of God
[52:47] that God chooses whom he will now I know
[52:51] a lot of folks don't believe in the
[52:52] ministry but thank God they'll really
[52:54] like do and the prophet tells us in 1962
[52:57] putting on the whole Army of God that
[53:00] God has placed in his body commanding
[53:03] officers now he doesn't just say those
[53:06] words and leave us to guess at what
[53:08] those commanding officers are but he
[53:10] goes to identifying them by position
[53:13] Apostles prophets pastors evangelists
[53:16] and teachers and he said those are God's
[53:19] commanding officers then that don't mean
[53:22] they're better than the laity it don't
[53:25] mean that they're you know they're going
[53:26] to live on the other side of heaven and
[53:28] it's going to be brighter golden more
[53:30] sunshine and better this and better that
[53:33] no they're actually servants to the rest
[53:35] of the body
[53:37] but yet God wants an army that will be
[53:41] able to each one find their position by
[53:43] The Calling of God now they asked for
[53:45] the man of a very simple question he had
[53:47] a great profound question and the
[53:49] question actually and they said brother
[53:50] Branham Hound us one find their position
[53:53] in Christ Jesus he said well generally
[53:56] brother sister your position is made
[53:58] known by the Holy Spirit revealing it to
[54:01] you and then it's also identified by
[54:04] whether you can do it or not so he said
[54:07] if a man claims that he's called to be a
[54:10] teacher watch how he interprets the word
[54:13] now watch watch how he interprets the
[54:16] word now he tells us again a question
[54:18] that's your six you want he says a man
[54:21] that says that he's called to be a
[54:23] pastor well he said a pastor cannot be a
[54:26] flighty person he's got to be a calm
[54:29] stable so he gives us identifications to
[54:32] be able to identify what the rank will
[54:35] be now he said myself I always thought
[54:37] it was be good to be a pastor he said
[54:40] that I never was a good pastor and never
[54:42] will be he said because I got this Roman
[54:45] Spirit on me now not r-o-m-a-n but
[54:49] r-o-a-m-i-n-g roaming spirit and he said
[54:52] I'm here today and gone come on I'm out
[54:54] there cutting the grass and I look at
[54:56] that airplane flying across the sky and
[54:58] I say where y'all going I want to go
[55:00] with you now he said but God has those
[55:02] that are pastors praise the Lord so God
[55:06] has those that are evangelists God has
[55:08] those that are musicians deacons
[55:10] whatever they are and every one of us
[55:13] will fight the devil to be able to find
[55:15] what our position is and once we find
[55:18] what our position is we'll fight the
[55:20] devil to be able to keep our position
[55:23] and be able to be satisfied when we find
[55:26] ourselves among others who hold the same
[55:29] rank but might be given more gifts than
[55:33] what we do now you see we might look at
[55:36] men that are generals I'll just okay
[55:38] with this same thought and there might
[55:40] be some of them and they fought in a
[55:41] right and they fought here and there and
[55:44] there and more you look at them and they
[55:46] got Metals Metals Metals metals and
[55:48] they're you're standing you're saying my
[55:49] goodness might look like they come from
[55:51] Big Lots you know I got them out of the
[55:53] candy machine I turned the front I paid
[55:55] 25 cent speech for it and I'm standing
[55:57] there if we're not careful we will tend
[55:59] to think well I'm nobody I'm absolutely
[56:02] nothing because I don't have all the
[56:05] great art and general armor and all the
[56:07] great Awards and this and that and the
[56:09] other you understand what we're doing
[56:10] when we do that we are questioning God's
[56:13] own choice himself it's not us that
[56:17] makes ourselves corporals or sergeants
[56:19] or whatever we are it's almighty God
[56:22] that makes us there and there is such
[56:25] great contentment one we find who we are
[56:28] and we don't have to go around comparing
[56:31] well I wish I could preach that's so and
[56:33] so I wish I was like so-and-so be what
[56:36] God has made you and be the best that
[56:39] you can be and that's all you'll have to
[56:41] answer for
[56:43] something about the human being we
[56:46] always always want to be more or
[56:48] depending on who you are some folks
[56:50] always want to be less you know so it's
[56:52] either more or less so it's like we're
[56:55] never satisfied been what God has made
[56:58] us and we can find here the setting of
[57:00] King Saul as we looked at it last week
[57:02] that song had that anointed king and
[57:06] song in his spirit and his makeup and
[57:08] his mentality was actually an epitome of
[57:11] the people you look at the leaders of
[57:13] the day and you'll get a pretty good
[57:16] idea of the economy of the people of the
[57:19] day look at our people in the White
[57:20] House it'll tell you a lot about where
[57:23] our nation is look at the governors look
[57:25] at the people that they elect to run the
[57:28] country and if we got a bunch of
[57:30] stinkers in the White House well more
[57:32] than likely will God sinkers in their
[57:34] house too because they vote that in well
[57:37] praise the Lord and that's really what
[57:40] they want do you think an honest man
[57:42] would ever be able to get off the ground
[57:44] running for president he's thank a man
[57:47] that would tell the truth a man that
[57:49] would really stand for the principles of
[57:52] what our constitution our Bill of Rights
[57:54] and so on was established on you reckon
[57:56] that man would get 500 votes you reckon
[57:59] they get a thousand why most people
[58:01] wouldn't have nothing for that guy they
[58:03] want a man and other disliked himself
[58:05] they want a shyster they want a liar
[58:08] they want a hypocrite they want a
[58:10] two-faced politician and they know he's
[58:13] lying to him he makes them all these
[58:15] promises if you vote for me I'll tell
[58:18] you what I'll make it so easy on you
[58:20] I'll I'll do this and that and the other
[58:22] and they've been lied to since they've
[58:24] been knee-high to a grasshopper and they
[58:26] know them God's lies and yet they just
[58:29] more they rally around them guys and
[58:31] they get in there and what do they do
[58:33] exact opposite of what they said they're
[58:35] going to do and someone will turn right
[58:38] back around and vote a man for a second
[58:40] term I mean we are asking for it aren't
[58:43] we and we we are absolutely asking for
[58:47] it but Saul was the epitome of the type
[58:50] of people in that age and they were a
[58:53] people that had rejected God's
[58:56] leadership God's leadership is going to
[58:59] be him being the king among them and he
[59:03] would be able to dictate through the
[59:05] word of God of a prophet they didn't
[59:07] need a kid but they said we want a king
[59:10] like everybody else we want to be like
[59:12] everybody we want a church like
[59:14] everybody else we want a preacher like
[59:16] everybody else you sure got the wrong
[59:18] one here ain't you we want songs like
[59:20] everybody else we want to live like
[59:22] everybody else so that means you want to
[59:24] go to hell with everybody else too
[59:27] oh my goodness not me I'm willing to be
[59:30] different myself I'm willing to have to
[59:33] sacrifice and give up whatever I need to
[59:35] do to escape hell yep it's worth it to
[59:37] me I think it's worth it to you too so
[59:40] what God had done was chose a man that
[59:44] started out as Samuel said to him that
[59:46] when you were little in your own sight
[59:48] now notice the people that no doubt
[59:50] already rallied around him and tried to
[59:53] lift him up Satan always does that to
[59:55] Men of God but it won't really bother
[59:57] the man of God himself what the people
[59:59] say until he begins to think in the same
[1:00:03] thing about himself well you know what I
[1:00:06] have got a little bit more than what my
[1:00:07] brothers do I'm a little bit more gifted
[1:00:10] than other guys and our church is a
[1:00:12] little bit bigger and there's a few more
[1:00:14] folks that stream our service and stream
[1:00:16] the other guy and the other guy you see
[1:00:18] when those thoughts go start going
[1:00:19] through a servant of God's heart he's
[1:00:22] already left that place of humility and
[1:00:25] is already exalting himself above his
[1:00:28] brothers
[1:00:29] now come on Saints you know it's the
[1:00:31] truth now Saul had actually entered into
[1:00:35] this place this is not his first time of
[1:00:37] Disobedience but it's going to be the
[1:00:39] terminating point to where that he will
[1:00:42] actually reject God's word I'm going to
[1:00:45] reject the word god rejects us but
[1:00:48] what's astounding about this is God
[1:00:50] rejected him out to this instance but he
[1:00:54] remained King for years
[1:00:57] now here he is walking in rejection and
[1:01:01] yet the blessing of God was still on
[1:01:03] this man's life because they still won
[1:01:06] battles they still went through all
[1:01:09] types of different things completely out
[1:01:11] of the will of God from that time on but
[1:01:14] yet he kept his crown he kept a Sloan
[1:01:17] room he kept his title he kept all that
[1:01:20] was associated with him and yet the
[1:01:22] prophet said God has rejected you so if
[1:01:26] you've been living in that day you're to
[1:01:28] call Samuel a false prophet because you
[1:01:31] looked at him and said that man is still
[1:01:33] a kid the blessing of God is still on
[1:01:36] his life he goes out there and fights
[1:01:38] battles and God gives him the Victory
[1:01:41] and we come back and Shout glory to God
[1:01:43] hallelujah but according to the word of
[1:01:46] the Lord God rejected him
[1:01:49] is that right now notice how the prophet
[1:01:52] deals with this about our position I
[1:01:55] would rather know and I want you to
[1:01:56] listen wanted astounding statement I'd
[1:01:58] rather know that I was in the will of
[1:02:00] God if I never spoke to another person
[1:02:05] then to preach to ten thousand people
[1:02:09] every night
[1:02:12] out of the will of God
[1:02:15] so you need a preacher could preach to
[1:02:19] ten thousand people every night and be
[1:02:23] out of the will of God all you have to
[1:02:25] do is turn down a portion of his word
[1:02:28] now this is how much that brother
[1:02:30] Branham loved the will of God and the
[1:02:34] value that he put on the will of God
[1:02:36] that He said if it was the will of God
[1:02:38] for him to never speak again now this
[1:02:41] should have been really quite a
[1:02:42] challenge for a preacher because it's in
[1:02:45] him to speak it's just something there
[1:02:47] it's beyond him but yet he said if it
[1:02:50] was the will of God for me to do so I'd
[1:02:53] rather not speak to another person than
[1:02:55] I would to stand up before ten thousand
[1:02:58] people and be out of the will of God I'd
[1:03:02] rather know the will of God I hope we
[1:03:05] all feel the same way tonight now notice
[1:03:07] it goes on to sail down a little bit
[1:03:09] lower in this paragraph what a privilege
[1:03:11] to find our place and their abide oh my
[1:03:15] what a privilege to find our place and
[1:03:19] their abide remember your life to
[1:03:21] children of Israel I'm sure the
[1:03:23] historian says the Book of Joshua it
[1:03:26] took about 26 years to write that that
[1:03:29] book so we have beginning in chapter one
[1:03:31] when God tells him that Moses my servant
[1:03:33] is dead remember those chapter two we
[1:03:35] move over to Jericho we move on and on
[1:03:38] and on for a span of about 26 years and
[1:03:40] they are fighting and fighting and
[1:03:42] fighting to get their land then we find
[1:03:45] it comes to the end of Joshua and moves
[1:03:48] over into the Book of Judges and then we
[1:03:50] find what a different setting the people
[1:03:52] have come in the land and now they're
[1:03:55] fighting to keep what they got
[1:03:58] you understand that for many of us we
[1:04:00] have to lay aside drinking or maybe
[1:04:02] smoke it or this or that or the other
[1:04:04] and you think why after I become a
[1:04:06] Christian but my battles are all over no
[1:04:08] they're not they just kind of change
[1:04:10] their actions a little bit then you will
[1:04:12] fight to keep every inch of the ground
[1:04:15] that you have gained in Christ Jesus you
[1:04:19] may fight for your health you may fight
[1:04:21] for your Revelation you might fight for
[1:04:24] everything that you've got in Christ
[1:04:26] Jesus but if it was worth fighting for
[1:04:28] initially I figure it's worth fighting
[1:04:31] for to keep it
[1:04:35] you will in heaven but not until
[1:04:39] now watch this he says what a privilege
[1:04:42] to find our place and their abide no
[1:04:44] matter how the devil shakes and what he
[1:04:48] says or how he scoffs listen to this
[1:04:51] simple advice say right straight in the
[1:04:55] will of God how many is that your desire
[1:04:57] tonight stay right straight in the will
[1:05:00] of God look again now he says just look
[1:05:03] at the Billy grahams in the land today
[1:05:06] but you know Billy Graham could never
[1:05:08] take your place I couldn't take Billy's
[1:05:12] place and he couldn't take mine I can't
[1:05:15] take yours and you can't take mine
[1:05:18] you're an individual and God God made
[1:05:21] you the way you are for some purpose if
[1:05:24] we would just find our place and then
[1:05:29] abide there if we try to do something
[1:05:32] different then we're in somebody else's
[1:05:37] territory
[1:05:40] so then if we try to move over into a
[1:05:44] position that God never called us for
[1:05:46] wherein somebody else's territory now
[1:05:49] many of you have heard me preach out and
[1:05:51] different conventions and churches and
[1:05:53] things and you know that I preach
[1:05:55] different whenever I go out I never
[1:05:58] preach with the same sternness I never
[1:06:01] preached with the same Authority because
[1:06:05] I'm not a pastor when I'm in a
[1:06:07] convention I'm not a pastor what I'm
[1:06:09] preaching in some other man's church so
[1:06:12] I will preach different because it's the
[1:06:15] same man but the administration will
[1:06:17] come forward in a way I always keep
[1:06:19] before me this is not my congregation
[1:06:22] this is not my church so I will preach
[1:06:26] in a way as a visiting Minister any man
[1:06:29] with wisdom will do the exact same thing
[1:06:32] so when men who have wisdom about
[1:06:34] position come to preach for us and you
[1:06:37] know them preach at home they will
[1:06:38] preach different and they should if they
[1:06:40] don't they still don't understand it yet
[1:06:42] why because it's a different
[1:06:44] Administration you know Timothy was
[1:06:47] actually the pastor of a church and yet
[1:06:50] Paul told Timothy do the work of an
[1:06:54] evangelist now he didn't say he was one
[1:06:57] so Paul wanted Timothy to go out and be
[1:07:00] able to minister in other places but he
[1:07:03] wanted him to know when you go out
[1:07:05] Timothy don't go out and try to Pastor
[1:07:09] another man's Church well praise the
[1:07:11] Lord I'm sorry y'all didn't know this if
[1:07:13] you're not supposed to go out and Pastor
[1:07:16] another man's church but you go out and
[1:07:19] you mix a little bit of pasture and a
[1:07:21] little bit of Doctrine and a little bit
[1:07:23] of evangelism and then it all heads up
[1:07:25] hopefully in a good meeting but then if
[1:07:28] I went out and preached to them the way
[1:07:30] I preached to you more than I could they
[1:07:32] wouldn't want me to come back because
[1:07:34] they're saying he ain't got no right to
[1:07:36] say that to me and in one sense of the
[1:07:38] word they're telling the truth and
[1:07:40] sometimes evangelists have come to our
[1:07:43] church as a matter of fact there's been
[1:07:45] a few I've had to talk to because they
[1:07:48] come to our church and it's almost like
[1:07:50] they acted like they was the pastor and
[1:07:53] to me they crossed a line a certain
[1:07:56] place well come on now
[1:07:58] now let me ask you folks that still got
[1:08:01] little youngins in your house or maybe
[1:08:02] big Elements which you want everybody in
[1:08:05] the church whooping your young ones
[1:08:07] really
[1:08:08] you mean y'all have a problem with that
[1:08:10] y'all have a real problem with it would
[1:08:12] you okay all right well you see God made
[1:08:15] a pasture soul that a pastor can wear
[1:08:18] you out I mean Tire you lamb from limb
[1:08:22] time every bit of the higher there is
[1:08:24] off of you and you waddle out to the car
[1:08:26] and you think glory to God I'm coming
[1:08:29] back Sunday
[1:08:31] [Applause]
[1:08:32] if I can get back
[1:08:35] Hallelujah that Pastor wore me out then
[1:08:38] I'm so grateful for a man of God that'll
[1:08:41] tell me the truth
[1:08:45] but if an evangelist comes in their
[1:08:48] steps Beyond his boundary as an
[1:08:51] evangelist and you know you've said in
[1:08:53] them types of services before and maybe
[1:08:55] the Evangelist was saying the truth but
[1:08:58] he wasn't the one to say it
[1:09:00] and it just didn't go over right
[1:09:03] it didn't feel right it didn't work
[1:09:06] right and at the end of the service it
[1:09:08] was a little bit aggravated and you
[1:09:10] wasn't aggravating in a good way why
[1:09:12] would somebody would preach with me
[1:09:13] tonight well what was it well you see if
[1:09:16] we're not careful whenever we go to
[1:09:18] intermingling in that will cross from
[1:09:21] one right over into another and it's the
[1:09:24] same way with the prophet's gift there's
[1:09:26] only one of them to an age that's going
[1:09:28] to come like a prophet messenger so
[1:09:31] Donnie Reagan any other preacher has no
[1:09:34] right to move into a position of the
[1:09:38] prophet of the age
[1:09:40] well praise the lord well Samuel was the
[1:09:43] prophet of that age Saul had no
[1:09:47] Authority
[1:09:49] to look at Samuel's words and try to
[1:09:53] decide if they were inspired or not
[1:09:58] oh praise the Lord now I want you to
[1:10:01] notice how brother Branham identifies
[1:10:03] this he says then we're in somebody
[1:10:05] else's territory which we just gone
[1:10:09] don't you love that word gum we gum up
[1:10:14] the picture of God
[1:10:18] so you mean simply moving saying
[1:10:21] evangelists moving out of his territory
[1:10:23] and he's in a visiting in a church and
[1:10:25] he moves over into a pastor saying now
[1:10:28] that anointing is here I didn't know
[1:10:30] anything she was a pastor I hope you
[1:10:32] understand that that's going to be
[1:10:33] harder for an advantageous than what you
[1:10:35] realize because that anointing is here
[1:10:37] and you will sit there and take it for a
[1:10:40] bit and he's got just a small window by
[1:10:42] which God will merge that over into it
[1:10:44] and it'll be fine and dandy but if it
[1:10:47] stays there too long he'll overstep that
[1:10:49] place and he got over into the pastor's
[1:10:52] territory and he gums up his sermon
[1:10:55] and then they wonder sometimes why it
[1:10:58] don't go over now this invisible lines
[1:11:00] it's very hard to Define where they are
[1:11:03] it's very hard when you're out
[1:11:06] especially when you preach fast you're
[1:11:07] preaching 90 miles an hour and you're
[1:11:09] still trying to keep them lines before
[1:11:11] you so it's like you realize you've got
[1:11:13] lion shown on both sides and you got to
[1:11:15] be so careful because she can't cross
[1:11:17] over well Saul you can see once a person
[1:11:19] becomes elevated they do away with all
[1:11:22] the lines then the way they're looking
[1:11:25] at it they're just as important as a
[1:11:27] prophet they're just as important as any
[1:11:29] Pastor anywhere they'll say whatever
[1:11:31] they want to say but that's God ain't
[1:11:34] nobody telling them what to say well
[1:11:35] that's a person that's full of themself
[1:11:37] they are a stuffed shirt
[1:11:41] that's what the prophet called them now
[1:11:44] notice this if you try to take the
[1:11:48] from your own
[1:11:52] whatever shape it's in or whatever color
[1:11:54] it's in you should be able to identify
[1:11:56] with this if you try to take the bone
[1:11:59] away from your own man you're just
[1:12:01] messing up your team
[1:12:04] guard you're mad see keep guarding him
[1:12:07] keep the rest of them so he can make the
[1:12:11] run and we'll have the touchdown so you
[1:12:13] know what kind of game we're playing
[1:12:15] this and this spiritual synopsis he's
[1:12:17] talking about football so then if the
[1:12:20] man your man whoever it was had got it
[1:12:23] on your side and oh my word I hear in
[1:12:25] the grass and well not us because I
[1:12:27] ain't gonna get out there and break my
[1:12:28] bones but you all you all are out there
[1:12:30] running and then your guy grabs a hold
[1:12:32] of the football here it goes way out oh
[1:12:35] he's got it he's got oh here he comes
[1:12:37] here he comes and my everybody Big Pete
[1:12:40] all these big guys here they come half
[1:12:43] back quarterback no back little back
[1:12:45] whatever they're called they get I turn
[1:12:46] the middle out of my way out of my way
[1:12:49] well that God he may not be able to run
[1:12:51] he may have all the muscles he may have
[1:12:54] all big bones and everything like that
[1:12:56] but maybe he can't run so fast but this
[1:12:58] little wiry Johnson he's got the baldy
[1:13:01] Here Comes little skinny Jonathan if it
[1:13:04] turns sideways and Rain he can stand
[1:13:06] under a clothesline and use it for an
[1:13:08] umbrella I bet here he come that little
[1:13:10] fella can fly across through there well
[1:13:12] what a big old Pete said Hey Little John
[1:13:14] get out of the way man let me have this
[1:13:17] ball and here comes a big old pee
[1:13:18] running down through there man he's a
[1:13:20] gone he's gone and somebody simply puts
[1:13:22] out their toe and Big Pete goes flat on
[1:13:23] the ground little Jonathan could have
[1:13:26] jumped right over the top of it and kept
[1:13:27] right on The Hobbit but you see we need
[1:13:30] one another but what we want to put
[1:13:33] little Jonathan as a guard not unless
[1:13:36] he's guarding ads what weapon what about
[1:13:39] little Jonathan to God some 250 pound
[1:13:42] guy he'd pick him up and swirl him
[1:13:44] around on his finger but we need some
[1:13:46] big guys with muscles some guys with
[1:13:49] some Brawn about him but we might need a
[1:13:51] little Irish Family Guy that we can
[1:13:54] throw that ball to and here he goes like
[1:13:56] greased lightning and they'll say
[1:13:57] where'd he go where'd he go oh you say I
[1:14:01] wanted to pack that ball what you want
[1:14:03] is to win so we want the one Hallelujah
[1:14:07] that can get us across the line if he
[1:14:10] does it we all win
[1:14:13] if you do it and can't do it we all lose
[1:14:20] [Music]
[1:14:22] oh
[1:14:24] of course I know none of our people
[1:14:27] who play sports
[1:14:29] are interested really in winning
[1:14:34] it's just all about playing
[1:14:37] it's just all about being around
[1:14:41] for the fellowship
[1:14:45] you'll go to hell for lying
[1:14:51] you know these people the spoof you and
[1:14:53] spam you all the time
[1:14:55] they get emails and return
[1:14:58] texts from me probably like no other
[1:15:01] because everyone under spoofs me I'll
[1:15:04] send some today I tell them this you go
[1:15:07] to hell for Life repent repent repent
[1:15:12] they want your password they want your
[1:15:15] email address
[1:15:16] well that's the way it is and reality if
[1:15:20] we say oh I'm the whole team you
[1:15:23] you know the whole team
[1:15:25] you see that's what's wrong with me the
[1:15:27] messed up people around the message they
[1:15:29] think they're the whole team that's why
[1:15:31] they don't have to go to church you're
[1:15:32] going to get run smack over
[1:15:34] you're gonna need somebody that can make
[1:15:37] a touchdown you're going to need
[1:15:39] somebody that'll stand with you when you
[1:15:42] don't know what to do I'm so glad I've
[1:15:44] got people that love me I'm so glad I've
[1:15:47] got people that pray for me I'm so glad
[1:15:50] I'm not in this life alone aren't you
[1:15:54] [Applause]
[1:16:02] notice how it says this will
[1:16:06] will
[1:16:07] have the touchdown after a while
[1:16:10] and Jesus will come so what if for one
[1:16:12] touchdown away from the rapture
[1:16:15] but Samantha message people are fussing
[1:16:17] over who gets the ball
[1:16:21] is that what matters
[1:16:23] is that what matters who gets the last
[1:16:25] one in Is that what matters who has the
[1:16:27] most Miracles and who has the most
[1:16:28] shouting is that really what matters
[1:16:32] let's make the last one so we can go
[1:16:34] home I don't know about you I'm sick of
[1:16:36] this place
[1:16:37] I'm hating this place worse and worse
[1:16:39] and worse every day I'm here
[1:16:44] well have a touchdown after a while and
[1:16:46] Jesus will come then it will all be over
[1:16:49] I love the way he says this the Lord
[1:16:51] bless you
[1:16:54] so we need these little wiry guys little
[1:16:57] skinny fellas that can run we need this
[1:17:00] big brownie guy he takes up two seats
[1:17:03] well we need him in their big wide
[1:17:04] shoulders
[1:17:07] we need people that are sensitive we
[1:17:10] need people that pray we need people
[1:17:13] that have a burden for the shut-in we
[1:17:15] need people that have a burden for those
[1:17:17] whenever you see somebody and there's
[1:17:19] been two or three services and they
[1:17:21] ain't been to church and yes I'm
[1:17:22] wondering about so and so or so and so
[1:17:24] reckon where they are well maybe you
[1:17:26] should call them maybe you should say
[1:17:28] Hey brother I've been missing your
[1:17:29] church are you doing okay or you say
[1:17:32] well I shouldn't do that you shouldn't
[1:17:34] what should not your body operate in one
[1:17:36] function so if the liver goes to acting
[1:17:40] up shouldn't the rest of the body go
[1:17:41] right toward it and help that body I'll
[1:17:44] tell you a friend we need one another
[1:17:46] now more than we have ever needed one
[1:17:49] another and the devil is going to try
[1:17:51] his best to tear us apart
[1:17:58] first Samuel 15 12.
[1:18:00] when Samuel rose up early
[1:18:03] to meet Saul in the morning
[1:18:06] it was told Samuel saying
[1:18:09] Saul came to Carmel
[1:18:11] and behold watch this now these words
[1:18:16] he set him
[1:18:19] up
[1:18:20] a place
[1:18:23] now what he's done
[1:18:25] he's made a memorial
[1:18:30] he says the words he's made a memorial
[1:18:33] so he's been out there fabricating and
[1:18:36] making this this Memorial
[1:18:38] to what
[1:18:39] this battle he just won defeating the
[1:18:43] amalekites
[1:18:45] so instead of setting up a memorial to
[1:18:49] God
[1:18:50] he set him up
[1:18:52] a place
[1:18:57] well I'll tell you one thing preachers
[1:18:59] have to watch this
[1:19:01] got to go to use them and they'll go to
[1:19:03] talking about it and talking about if
[1:19:05] you're not careful you hear them talking
[1:19:06] about theirself more than anybody else's
[1:19:09] Ministry
[1:19:10] and it's like their church is the only
[1:19:13] one that's alive
[1:19:14] their church and the message is the only
[1:19:17] one where God is moving well just in
[1:19:19] case you're wondering tonight let me let
[1:19:21] you know our church ain't the only one
[1:19:24] that has a move of God As a matter of
[1:19:26] fact there's a move of God all over this
[1:19:29] world
[1:19:30] I'm talking about in India and Africa
[1:19:33] all over the United States at ages two
[1:19:36] or three different churches oh and
[1:19:38] everybody's going to flock to them two
[1:19:40] three churches I want you to show me
[1:19:41] where God's Prophet taught that I want
[1:19:44] you to show me what brother Branham
[1:19:45] would get up and tell people and pull on
[1:19:48] the people to move to his church and
[1:19:50] never done no such a thing and I ain't
[1:19:52] going to do it neither and I don't want
[1:19:54] you doing it we wanted one here at this
[1:19:56] church who God wants at this church I
[1:19:59] don't want them coming here because our
[1:20:01] music is good I don't want them coming
[1:20:03] here because we got a new building no if
[1:20:06] they feel that of the Lord they want to
[1:20:08] come here on the letter the spirit of
[1:20:09] God I want them to come because the word
[1:20:12] is right the spirit is Right lives are
[1:20:15] being changed forget to build and forget
[1:20:17] how pretty the music is forget the big
[1:20:20] Sunday school rooms forget all of that
[1:20:22] is God there that's what I want to know
[1:20:25] is God there if they're coming for the
[1:20:27] word they'll stay if they're coming for
[1:20:30] for a gift
[1:20:32] then when the man with the gift dies
[1:20:34] what happens
[1:20:39] oh my
[1:20:41] God so Saul came to Carmel and behold he
[1:20:44] set him up a place
[1:20:47] and it's gone about and passed on and
[1:20:51] gone down to gilgall
[1:20:54] notice
[1:20:55] as we look here in verse 13. and Samuel
[1:20:59] came to Saul and said unto him blessed
[1:21:03] these thou the Lord
[1:21:06] oh he's religious any glory to God
[1:21:09] I have performed the Commandment of the
[1:21:13] Lord
[1:21:19] my goodness
[1:21:21] this is scary friends
[1:21:26] and Samuel said
[1:21:28] what meaneth this bleeding
[1:21:31] of the Sheep
[1:21:33] man
[1:21:40] oh well
[1:21:42] I didn't think he was inspired
[1:21:45] when you said that quote
[1:21:47] so I use my better judgment
[1:21:50] about it
[1:21:52] and I felt like you know I mean I wasn't
[1:21:54] really sure if that was the word of the
[1:21:56] Lord or not because actually uh Samuel
[1:21:58] Phil remember you never said thus saith
[1:22:01] the Lord
[1:22:08] so I thought it would be best
[1:22:12] if we brought these back as a sacrifice
[1:22:15] to the Lord
[1:22:19] I'll tell you friends this cares me when
[1:22:21] I see the way folks in this message
[1:22:23] handle this message
[1:22:25] they cut and slice and pick and choose
[1:22:29] and if it don't suit them they don't
[1:22:32] read them
[1:22:34] it's amazing how many preachers do it
[1:22:36] I've seen preachers for years decades
[1:22:39] quotes when they'd be off on this or
[1:22:42] that or the other you might as well send
[1:22:44] them bubble gum wrappers It Don't Mean a
[1:22:47] bit more to them than I said well I
[1:22:48] don't I don't know what you think about
[1:22:50] a preacher like that but in my book a
[1:22:52] preacher like that don't really believe
[1:22:53] the message anyway
[1:22:55] if God's Prophet was entrusted to be
[1:22:59] able to call the bride out for Christ is
[1:23:01] he not entrusted to tell us how to set a
[1:23:04] church in order
[1:23:05] and to tell us how we ought to do this
[1:23:07] and do that and the other are we going
[1:23:09] to be like Saul that we're going to
[1:23:12] exalt our opinion above a Vindicated
[1:23:16] prophet's message
[1:23:18] not me
[1:23:21] well praise the Lord
[1:23:24] and Samuel said what meaneth this
[1:23:26] bleeding of the sheep in my ears and the
[1:23:28] lowing of the oxen
[1:23:31] which I hear and Saul said they
[1:23:35] have brought them from the amalekites
[1:23:39] thought the people
[1:23:45] here's the kind of leader he was
[1:23:48] he couldn't admit he'd miss God
[1:23:51] you see God tries preachers
[1:23:55] yeah he tries them he'll give them so
[1:23:58] much
[1:23:59] and then he'll try he'll see what they
[1:24:02] do with it
[1:24:03] how do they use it how do they Channel
[1:24:06] it do they Channel it toward them toward
[1:24:10] their Church toward their name you
[1:24:12] realize what a lot of men have done
[1:24:14] friends down to the ages I was thinking
[1:24:16] about Oral Roberts today and A.A Allen
[1:24:20] and many different ones that we could
[1:24:22] name and the era when brother random was
[1:24:25] here of course Oral Roberts left a
[1:24:28] university
[1:24:30] went out to Arizona and Bart uh you know
[1:24:33] all this property out there in Arizona
[1:24:36] still there it's still there Miracle
[1:24:39] Mile
[1:24:41] so we bought all these Acres out there
[1:24:44] to be able to establish this place John
[1:24:46] Alexander Dowry goes to Chicago Illinois
[1:24:49] for those of you that don't know it the
[1:24:51] little city there was a little city
[1:24:53] called Zion Illinois John Alexander
[1:24:57] dolly was part of the ones who founded
[1:24:59] that place and it was going to be a
[1:25:02] heaven on Earth
[1:25:04] the original part of Zion Illinois all
[1:25:07] of their streets have biblical names all
[1:25:09] right brother Joe y'all used to live
[1:25:10] forever Brother Gary so it was going to
[1:25:13] be a heaven on Earth what was it it was
[1:25:15] him building a war memorial
[1:25:19] and what did he leave sign Illinois and
[1:25:23] what's it turned into now well it's just
[1:25:25] a suburb of Chicago just as filthy and
[1:25:27] rotten as all the rest of what did Oral
[1:25:29] Roberts University turn into about like
[1:25:31] any other university well come on
[1:25:33] somebody and then I got to thinking and
[1:25:37] what did William Branham build
[1:25:43] I traveled different parts of this great
[1:25:45] United States I've seen many bridges
[1:25:48] many roads many highways named after
[1:25:52] Billy Graham
[1:25:55] Oral Roberts this one that one the other
[1:25:57] I got to thinking that if Pete what was
[1:26:00] it that God's Prophet left to us
[1:26:04] a university
[1:26:07] yeah right
[1:26:09] was it a great Memorial somewhere did he
[1:26:12] build a you know 50 million dollar
[1:26:15] Cathedral
[1:26:17] we'll go to eighth and Penn Street
[1:26:20] and you can see
[1:26:22] so did he leave us a college where we
[1:26:25] could send the use
[1:26:29] oh all Roberts University or are you so
[1:26:33] maybe we'll call this WBU William
[1:26:36] Branham University
[1:26:41] but what did he leave us
[1:26:43] the word of God
[1:26:46] a restoration back to that word
[1:26:50] now his gifts superseded all of those
[1:26:53] men put together had more Supernatural
[1:26:57] more visitations from God that all of
[1:27:00] them men put together millions of
[1:27:02] daughters could have ended his hands at
[1:27:04] his disposal but he didn't want it why
[1:27:07] he did not want to build a war memorial
[1:27:11] I'd done this I accomplished that what
[1:27:16] did he leave a message
[1:27:20] a message that would reach to the black
[1:27:24] the white the red the yellow Hallelujah
[1:27:27] it would reach across racial barriers it
[1:27:31] would reach across Financial barriers it
[1:27:34] would call us together from around the
[1:27:36] world there has never been nothing like
[1:27:39] it and never shall be again
[1:27:41] he did not leave a memorial he left
[1:27:47] a message
[1:27:50] a message
[1:27:54] and then you know what's sad
[1:27:56] then a bunch of self-centered preachers
[1:27:58] go to getting in it and what do they do
[1:28:01] go to building their own memorials
[1:28:05] oh yeah they call them by different
[1:28:07] names seventh under this proves you this
[1:28:09] return this this that the other what is
[1:28:12] it preachers trying to build himself a
[1:28:14] memorial
[1:28:15] brother Donnie what are you going to
[1:28:17] build I hope it's all of my heart I'm
[1:28:19] building Sons and Daughters of God
[1:28:22] I don't want nothing after my name I
[1:28:25] don't want nothing go for you can
[1:28:27] remember if I go to the way of the Grave
[1:28:29] well let's pick up some this and that
[1:28:31] and the other so we can remember brother
[1:28:32] Donnie no the greatest honor you can
[1:28:35] ever do to me is live what I'm preaching
[1:28:38] and pray and be filled with the Holy
[1:28:41] Ghost and live a life that is so
[1:28:43] pleasing to God that when the Rapture
[1:28:46] comes you go away
[1:28:48] then we'll stand together that day and
[1:28:52] I'll be able to present you with the
[1:28:54] seventh Church age messenger and will
[1:28:56] walk in under the battical or call it to
[1:28:59] God of Malachi 4.
[1:29:04] ah
[1:29:06] oh my
[1:29:08] look in first Samuel 15 3
[1:29:11] what actually Samuel said
[1:29:15] now go and smite amalek
[1:29:19] and utterly destroyed
[1:29:22] all that they have and spare them not
[1:29:26] now listen
[1:29:27] but slay both men and woman
[1:29:32] infant and serpent ox and sheep
[1:29:38] camel
[1:29:39] an ass
[1:29:42] how he knows
[1:29:45] he did not do exactly that but he is
[1:29:48] convinced but somebody's convinced I did
[1:29:52] what God wanted me to do look at this
[1:29:54] great Victory Hallelujah I still feel it
[1:29:57] all over me glory to God well that's
[1:29:59] that's that's it right there ain't it
[1:30:03] it's not how much we obey God
[1:30:05] but it's what we can do
[1:30:07] I'm going to give God this and I'm going
[1:30:10] to give God that
[1:30:13] all I give him I want to give it to him
[1:30:15] along with obedience to his word
[1:30:20] because if I don't
[1:30:22] I will present to him my works
[1:30:26] and my Disobedience will cancel out
[1:30:28] everything that I've done
[1:30:36] sincere that ain't enough
[1:30:40] Mark chapter 7 how be it in vain do they
[1:30:43] worship me teaching for Doctrine the
[1:30:48] Commandments of men can you imagine
[1:30:50] millions of people going to church every
[1:30:52] week worshiping God praising have their
[1:30:54] praise bands have all that sort of thing
[1:30:56] worship sing cry get emotional sincere
[1:31:00] as they can be absolutely sincere and
[1:31:03] lost
[1:31:04] why they're following the Commandments
[1:31:07] of men and make that their Doctrine you
[1:31:09] can show them up the word said my pastor
[1:31:12] don't believe that
[1:31:15] now notice back to First Samuel 15 19
[1:31:18] wherefore then did a style not obey the
[1:31:21] voice of the Lord that this fly upon the
[1:31:23] spoil and deceive on the side of the
[1:31:24] Lord and Saul Center Samuel yay
[1:31:28] I have obeyed the voice of the Lord
[1:31:37] and have gone the way
[1:31:40] which the Lord sent me
[1:31:42] I'd have brought AJ the king of amalek
[1:31:46] was that what God Said
[1:31:50] but watch what he does he merges his
[1:31:53] will
[1:31:54] his thought
[1:31:56] in with the promise of God
[1:31:59] to make his will and God's will appear
[1:32:02] to be
[1:32:03] the same
[1:32:10] friends this is what gets all of us in
[1:32:13] trouble to this very day
[1:32:15] when we will try to reason with this and
[1:32:18] reason with that and oh well you know I
[1:32:20] don't know I mean my goodness you know
[1:32:22] we're living my goodness we're living in
[1:32:23] 2023 surely God don't expect us to live
[1:32:26] live this way he does yeah he actually
[1:32:28] does and God expects preachers to live
[1:32:31] way too God expects preachers to Obama's
[1:32:33] matter of fact he expects them more
[1:32:34] against anybody else but a lot of times
[1:32:36] preachers are the one that pushes the
[1:32:38] boundaries
[1:32:39] so I think it by well oh my goodness
[1:32:42] priest mother Donny
[1:32:48] I have brought a game the king of amalek
[1:32:51] and how utterly destroyed how can you
[1:32:54] utterly destroy everything when the king
[1:32:57] is sitting right there
[1:33:01] well maybe said I felt led
[1:33:06] well hey you know what I've done been
[1:33:09] around for a long time now and I've done
[1:33:12] found out with a lot of folks
[1:33:15] that right there overrides any Scripture
[1:33:18] any quote
[1:33:25] well praise the Lord
[1:33:27] will you all be praying quick I get off
[1:33:29] this part of this series won't you
[1:33:31] notice verse 21 but the people took of
[1:33:35] the spoil sheep and oxen the chief of
[1:33:38] the thing I
[1:33:42] they should have been destroyed okay are
[1:33:45] you happy now
[1:33:48] you see can watch his attitude and see
[1:33:50] he finally just goes ahead and admits a
[1:33:53] little bit of it but admits it with an
[1:33:55] attitude
[1:33:57] Sally continues to lay blame on the
[1:34:01] people I draw who was this guy King Saul
[1:34:03] King Saul King Saul and saulkner said
[1:34:07] wait a minute wait a minute
[1:34:09] this is not right look look consult the
[1:34:11] prophet here
[1:34:15] oh my goodness
[1:34:17] so Saul added Pride
[1:34:19] lying
[1:34:21] passing the blame
[1:34:23] Rebellion
[1:34:26] to his stubbornness
[1:34:31] my goodness I went home Wednesday after
[1:34:35] last Wednesday service so this on my
[1:34:37] mind went to baby that on my mind got
[1:34:39] got up the next morning on Thursday and
[1:34:42] I started studying just on the word obey
[1:34:45] went from The Book of Genesis all the
[1:34:47] way to Revelation then I looked at
[1:34:49] obeying and obedience every form that I
[1:34:53] could find obedience obedient every word
[1:34:57] that I could find in the scripture I was
[1:34:59] just absolutely overwhelmed
[1:35:01] to see how much God loves obedience
[1:35:06] but even though it may be simple to us
[1:35:08] and sometimes we don't even understand
[1:35:10] his will about it
[1:35:13] for us to give him praise and trials
[1:35:16] when you do it you're obeying
[1:35:20] and that pleases him when you do it
[1:35:23] notice Samuel said I said Lord has great
[1:35:26] Delight remember we read this last
[1:35:28] Wednesday night pleasure desire
[1:35:31] longing so God Longs praise the Lord God
[1:35:36] longs
[1:35:38] for this type of something from his
[1:35:40] people half the Lord is great delight
[1:35:43] and burn offerings and sacrifices as in
[1:35:46] obeying the voice of the Lord so this is
[1:35:48] why many of these people that we've been
[1:35:50] reading or not in Corinthians will stand
[1:35:51] there that day and the worst shall be a
[1:35:54] total loss so preachers that have
[1:35:55] preached their dogmas and their Doctrine
[1:35:57] Every Woman preacher will be a totally
[1:35:59] lost when she stands there there'll be
[1:36:01] some of them that will be saved yes so
[1:36:03] as by fire but they will lose every work
[1:36:06] they've ever done every missionary that
[1:36:09] has baptized people in an adultery
[1:36:13] baptism
[1:36:14] gonna send the prophet teaches us
[1:36:16] someone you're baptized in the name of
[1:36:18] father son holy ghost that is an
[1:36:20] adultery baptism how can you be bride
[1:36:23] married to the bridegroom and have an
[1:36:26] adultery baptism
[1:36:31] praise the Lord so they'll lose
[1:36:34] everything
[1:36:35] it's like they will stand there and
[1:36:37] assist that they just got saved like the
[1:36:39] thief on the cross yet they were
[1:36:41] Theologian they were a preacher they
[1:36:43] were this side the other and they're
[1:36:44] standing there expecting all these
[1:36:46] rewards and they look behind them and
[1:36:48] there's absolutely nothing
[1:36:53] oh Jesus don't let that happen to us
[1:36:55] Lord
[1:36:58] behold
[1:37:01] two oh
[1:37:05] it's better
[1:37:07] than sacrifice
[1:37:09] you see this is why brother Branham
[1:37:11] could say this opening quote that if he
[1:37:13] would be in the will of God to never
[1:37:15] speak to one more person and that would
[1:37:17] be the will of God he'd rather do that
[1:37:19] than to speak to ten thousand a night
[1:37:22] out of the will of God why because
[1:37:25] obedience is better than sacrifice so a
[1:37:28] person sacrifices their strength and
[1:37:29] they give up this and they do that and
[1:37:31] the other but if they're disobeying God
[1:37:33] as they go along the way what's it going
[1:37:35] to be attributed to they'll lose the
[1:37:37] whole thing
[1:37:39] all being smoke
[1:37:41] notice behold to obey is better than
[1:37:44] sacrifice to hearken oh my to hearken to
[1:37:48] hear be a tenant he pay attention listen
[1:37:52] so to hearken it's better than the fat
[1:37:55] of rims now remember who sang this this
[1:37:57] is Samuel which is a levite
[1:38:01] and a prophet
[1:38:03] he knew how important the sacrifices
[1:38:06] were he knew they were a requirement of
[1:38:09] God but look what he's bringing right
[1:38:11] along with that requirement of the
[1:38:13] sacrifice if you don't have obedience
[1:38:17] them sacrifices are in vain
[1:38:23] let me come to verse 23. for Rebellion
[1:38:28] now what are we talking about rebellion
[1:38:31] already mentioned Rebellion because this
[1:38:33] is what Saul did
[1:38:36] so he rebelled against the teaching of
[1:38:39] the Prophet the word of God spoken by
[1:38:42] the prophet and exalted his own opinion
[1:38:46] above that word well I just don't think
[1:38:48] that's necessary
[1:38:50] yeah I just don't feel that we need to
[1:38:53] do that
[1:38:54] I just don't think that we are our kids
[1:38:57] I just don't think they need to get all
[1:39:00] worked up
[1:39:01] and get a Pentecostal experience I know
[1:39:03] you're going to understand but there's a
[1:39:05] war going on right now and the ranks of
[1:39:07] the message
[1:39:09] it's a war on one side
[1:39:12] that's foreign motion for prayer lines
[1:39:15] for the supernatural move
[1:39:17] and then the other side in the message
[1:39:20] is against prayer lines preaching
[1:39:22] against them
[1:39:23] against people falling out
[1:39:27] against people getting emotional
[1:39:30] against people worshiping God
[1:39:33] and trying to find quotes and scriptures
[1:39:34] to back it up
[1:39:37] well I'll tell you one thing any
[1:39:39] preacher comes here and goes to
[1:39:40] preaching out here I'm going to back him
[1:39:42] up against the wall and tell him there's
[1:39:45] more quotes
[1:39:46] and there's more scriptures
[1:39:49] uh-huh come on now
[1:39:53] because you know what that preacher's
[1:39:55] doing he's doing exactly what Saul did
[1:39:57] he's taken the quotes he wants all but
[1:40:01] he won't take them quotes in invisible
[1:40:03] Union or the prophet of God said they
[1:40:05] don't want none of them tongues speaking
[1:40:07] Acts 2 38 young ones around
[1:40:10] aha they don't want none of them but he
[1:40:12] says that's the only kind the word can
[1:40:15] bring forth they don't want that second
[1:40:18] items children whales acting like they
[1:40:21] did on the day of Pentecost come on
[1:40:23] somebody preach with me I'll tell you
[1:40:26] one thing this Prophet said it is our
[1:40:28] right in the church age book it is our
[1:40:31] inalienable right to be exactly the
[1:40:34] church that was Mark 16. yes I believe
[1:40:38] in laying hands on the sick yes I still
[1:40:41] believe in casting out devil and yes I'm
[1:40:44] still going to have prayer life and yes
[1:40:46] I'm still going to shout and yes if the
[1:40:49] Holy Ghost moves on me I'm still going
[1:40:52] to jump I'm still going to speak in tone
[1:40:55] I'm going to worship God because it is
[1:40:58] my right as a child of God it is my
[1:41:03] right to have Victory it's my right to
[1:41:05] hide peace and if you don't want it
[1:41:08] going back to the Church of Christ
[1:41:16] thank you
[1:41:22] I know some of them preachers know them
[1:41:24] quotes
[1:41:26] because I've sent them to them
[1:41:31] you think it Alters them absolutely not
[1:41:34] why they're like so
[1:41:38] they'll take what they want and they'll
[1:41:39] say bless God I'm preaching what the
[1:41:42] prophet said no tell them the truth
[1:41:45] you're preaching part
[1:41:47] of what the prophet said
[1:41:49] how can this Prophet come and preach
[1:41:51] something different than Jesus preached
[1:41:55] remember who it was that gave the
[1:41:58] Commission in Mark 16 it wasn't a man it
[1:42:03] wasn't a prophet if the Lord Jesus
[1:42:06] didn't want his children laying hands on
[1:42:08] one another blame him he's the one who
[1:42:12] said they shall lay their hands on the
[1:42:15] sick and they shall recover
[1:42:19] and once and brother Branham they gave
[1:42:22] the commission it was not Peter it was
[1:42:25] not Paul it was the Lord Jesus himself
[1:42:29] they shall speak with new tongues and
[1:42:31] somebody said but shall glory to God if
[1:42:35] they drink any day they say it shall not
[1:42:38] harm them
[1:42:44] [Music]
[1:42:52] brother Donnie we was hoping as you got
[1:42:54] older
[1:42:56] that you'd get more wisdom and you'd
[1:42:58] calm down
[1:43:00] if I get in a wheelchair I'll be the
[1:43:02] only preacher in the message with wheels
[1:43:03] to popping wheelies on my wheelchair
[1:43:05] shouting under the influence of the Holy
[1:43:08] Ghost
[1:43:09] hallelujah oh glory to God I don't care
[1:43:12] how old your house young you are that
[1:43:14] ain't got nothing to do with your age
[1:43:16] it's knowing that you're born again the
[1:43:18] only thing I can figure is into these
[1:43:20] message preachers that's against emotion
[1:43:22] is because they never been born again
[1:43:24] their self why in the world would any
[1:43:26] preacher fight the baptism of the Holy
[1:43:29] Ghost if he's ever had it he'd want
[1:43:31] everybody to get it it brought his
[1:43:34] children to get it and what his
[1:43:36] grandchildren together he'd want
[1:43:38] everybody in this church to get it
[1:43:46] thank you
[1:43:51] well brother Donnie you just say that
[1:43:53] because you come from Pentecost now I
[1:43:55] say that because I come from God
[1:44:02] let me close
[1:44:04] for Rebellion
[1:44:07] because that's the sin of witchcraft
[1:44:11] so in any message preacher refuses
[1:44:14] quotes scriptures
[1:44:17] because of his own preconceived idea
[1:44:21] he might as well draw a pentagram on the
[1:44:23] floor of his church and cut the throat
[1:44:25] of a goat
[1:44:27] and worship the devil
[1:44:40] because he's worshiping one less than
[1:44:43] the devil he's worshiping himself
[1:44:47] well I don't rock this I don't really
[1:44:50] care what you don't like
[1:44:53] hey man
[1:44:55] brother Tony these pictures or
[1:44:57] disfellowship with you what's new about
[1:44:59] that Lord have mercy I'm one of the most
[1:45:02] disfellowship preachers in America you
[1:45:04] think I'm going to worry about that you
[1:45:05] think I'm going to set up tonight and
[1:45:07] lose one week of sleep over a bunch of
[1:45:09] Baptist preachers sending a message full
[1:45:11] of pissed when they shouldn't even be
[1:45:12] there in the first place not born again
[1:45:14] not filled with the Holy Ghost not got a
[1:45:17] word verse I don't want third people
[1:45:19] shot in the victory Of God don't want
[1:45:21] their people to be healed don't want
[1:45:23] their people to be delivered not bad
[1:45:25] ain't got no right being in the Pulpit
[1:45:27] saying he's preaching the gospel the
[1:45:30] gospel makes God's children free it
[1:45:33] breaks the Yoke of sin and breaks the
[1:45:36] Yoke of unbelief it will make you free
[1:45:39] indeed
[1:45:42] make you free
[1:45:55] Ze you see what Rebellion does
[1:45:58] it dethrones God
[1:46:04] it dethrones God
[1:46:08] and set up who whatever man it is that
[1:46:11] you're taking over God's word
[1:46:13] then you're setting him up as your
[1:46:15] absolute
[1:46:18] and if it's your mama well you move God
[1:46:21] out of his throne you got your mama
[1:46:22] sitting there
[1:46:23] fit your daddy
[1:46:25] Uncle so and so on ain't so and so or
[1:46:28] you're rotten self
[1:46:30] well I don't believe and I don't think
[1:46:33] you've got yourself on God's wrong you
[1:46:36] Dethrone God who are we
[1:46:39] who are we to Dethrone the Almighty
[1:46:48] dear friends it's going to be a fearful
[1:46:49] thing one day
[1:46:53] I said a lot
[1:46:55] it's really it's really sad that these
[1:46:58] folks out here where they're going to
[1:47:00] stand when it comes to the message and
[1:47:01] being judged by it you know what's worse
[1:47:04] people who say they believe it
[1:47:07] and preachers leading the pack
[1:47:10] and we'll pick and sort and pick and
[1:47:13] sort
[1:47:15] and exalt their opinion above a
[1:47:17] Vindicated prophet of God
[1:47:21] I've sent preachers quotes after quotes
[1:47:24] after quotes through the years I think
[1:47:26] maybe they're ignorant maybe they don't
[1:47:28] know no different
[1:47:29] and you send them page after page after
[1:47:32] page after page
[1:47:35] don't even affect them
[1:47:39] and they'll text you back or email you
[1:47:41] thanks for the information
[1:47:45] when you say information
[1:47:55] oh my goodness
[1:47:57] Rebellion
[1:47:59] is that's the sin of Witchcraft and
[1:48:01] stubbornness
[1:48:03] is as iniquity
[1:48:06] and idolatry
[1:48:09] what's a Hebrew word there
[1:48:11] for an idolatrous Terror friend
[1:48:15] so a terraform
[1:48:17] was an idol
[1:48:19] made of Clay Wood whatever
[1:48:23] so you can imagine that the prophet is
[1:48:25] telling Samuel
[1:48:28] it's it's equivalent to idolatry
[1:48:32] oh my goodness
[1:48:35] so for a man to commit a sin and be
[1:48:37] proven by the scripture
[1:48:40] or the message that is wrong and go
[1:48:43] right on in his obstinacy
[1:48:46] God have mercy
[1:48:48] no doubt every one of us here tonight
[1:48:51] our believing things that's wrong
[1:48:55] we just don't know it yet
[1:48:58] but a real son or daughter or God that's
[1:48:59] filled with the Holy Ghost you show them
[1:49:01] where they're wrong they'll straighten
[1:49:03] up
[1:49:07] I don't understand how people can go for
[1:49:09] weeks and months and years and years
[1:49:14] and years
[1:49:15] and fight the very message they say they
[1:49:18] believe
[1:49:20] and think they're going in a rapture
[1:49:24] God help us
[1:49:26] God help us
[1:49:29] God help us
[1:49:31] God help us that we don't turn into such
[1:49:33] people by the skin
[1:49:35] God help us
[1:49:37] that we will always humble ourselves by
[1:49:40] the chapel before the word of God
[1:49:44] and lay our stubbornness and our
[1:49:46] Rebellion you see why God so hates this
[1:49:48] it comes from the Devil
[1:49:52] stubbornness is not from God
[1:49:55] it's from Satan
[1:49:58] Rebellion
[1:50:01] is not from God
[1:50:03] that's what I'm saying look at it all
[1:50:04] down through the scripture look on the
[1:50:06] children of Israel rebelled against
[1:50:07] Moses look and they rebelled against
[1:50:09] this leader that leader even though they
[1:50:11] were the called out people but they
[1:50:12] rebelled against God's chosen leader and
[1:50:15] look what God done to him
[1:50:18] we'll do this and that and the other
[1:50:21] Moses he don't know what he's doing
[1:50:22] we'll do this and that you understand
[1:50:23] what they did trying to split the
[1:50:25] children of Israel you understand why
[1:50:26] God looks at that when people rebel
[1:50:29] against God's chosen leader it is open
[1:50:31] Rebellion against God himself
[1:50:36] they looked at both oh he's a man he's
[1:50:38] just doing this and that other than
[1:50:39] nothing but a big family deal look at
[1:50:41] his sister she's in charge of the music
[1:50:42] department season one does all the
[1:50:44] shouting all the singing playing the
[1:50:45] tambourine look at his brother he's the
[1:50:47] high priest look at his nephew he's the
[1:50:48] priest it's a whole family deal they
[1:50:50] look I said there's more here than Moses
[1:50:52] I'll tell one thing but God said step
[1:50:54] back and I'll destroy him
[1:50:57] why they rebelled against God's choice
[1:51:01] of the leader of that move
[1:51:04] when message preachers exalt themselves
[1:51:07] a bunch above God's Prophet they're
[1:51:09] doing the same thing dathan and Korah
[1:51:12] did in the wilderness
[1:51:16] well God sent brother Branham of course
[1:51:18] as a prophet but God sent brother so and
[1:51:20] so up here in the Northeast to add
[1:51:23] clarification
[1:51:25] to the message
[1:51:27] to make it more understandable and then
[1:51:30] God sent another man on down in the
[1:51:32] Middle East so that he would be the
[1:51:34] teacher among the message and then God
[1:51:36] sent another man over here and God sent
[1:51:38] another man over there so it's Malachi 4
[1:51:40] and you Malachi 4 and you Malachi 4 and
[1:51:42] you said we've got to have malachiophore
[1:51:44] in you and before long Malachi before
[1:51:46] disappears and you're the one that
[1:51:48] appears on the same you're not writing
[1:51:50] and shining their Shining Armor well I'm
[1:51:52] fixing to Buck you off this horsepower
[1:51:54] there ain't no scripture in the word of
[1:51:56] God that tells us he'll ever be anything
[1:51:58] greater as a matter of fact God's
[1:52:00] Prophet said if anything ever Rises
[1:52:02] greater than this I'm a false prophet so
[1:52:05] I don't care who says they've got a
[1:52:07] greater move they're a liar amen I said
[1:52:11] they are a liar
[1:52:25] God bless y'all
[1:52:28] sure love you
[1:52:30] [Applause]
[1:52:39] this battle hits
[1:52:43] Hallelujah
[1:52:48] oh dear God
[1:52:51] hide Me Lord
[1:52:54] hide me
[1:52:57] hide me from me
[1:53:03] ah these people
[1:53:06] are their soul
[1:53:08] from The Pride
[1:53:10] Robson and see
[1:53:12] the arrogance are flesh
[1:53:16] oh Lord
[1:53:19] we don't ever want to become a saw
[1:53:22] we don't ever want to become one that
[1:53:25] picks and chooses and picks and chooses
[1:53:29] help us Lord
[1:53:32] the prophet identified his ministry to
[1:53:34] us when he said that 1962 that he hoped
[1:53:37] God
[1:53:39] and let him take the course of his word
[1:53:42] and dress his bride in it
[1:53:46] and he said if he could find a character
[1:53:49] like Rebecca
[1:53:52] then if he could get her to stand still
[1:53:54] long enough
[1:53:56] to be able to get her dressed in the
[1:53:58] cloths of the word
[1:54:01] oh Jesus we don't want to meet you in
[1:54:03] our filthy rags
[1:54:06] Lord God that we know that there was
[1:54:08] given unto us
[1:54:09] fine women
[1:54:11] clean and white
[1:54:13] we believe it comes towards Jesus with
[1:54:16] what you purchased for us on the cross
[1:54:18] by your blood
[1:54:19] and then it comes by the washing of the
[1:54:21] water of the word of Malachi 4 in the
[1:54:24] last days
[1:54:26] so it ain't no wonder then Satan will
[1:54:28] try to come and add this and take away
[1:54:31] that well you know we don't know what
[1:54:33] brother Brandon was in the flesh when he
[1:54:34] said that or not well we're just we we
[1:54:36] don't know and you know after all he was
[1:54:39] just a man and that that might have been
[1:54:40] some of his old Baptist ways and
[1:54:43] I could understand some of these
[1:54:44] denominational people saying that but
[1:54:46] message people
[1:54:48] help us Lord
[1:54:50] help us Lord to stay clean to that evil
[1:54:52] spirit
[1:54:55] oh God we love you Lord Jesus
[1:54:58] we don't want to be stubborn
[1:55:01] we don't want to be rebellious
[1:55:03] help us father we want our church to be
[1:55:06] built upon the doctrine of the Apostles
[1:55:08] and the prophets Jesus Christ himself
[1:55:12] being the Chief Cornerstone
[1:55:15] Lord help us
[1:55:18] that we can be faithful when you come
[1:55:20] you're the one who asked the question
[1:55:22] when the son of man cometh
[1:55:25] will he find faith
[1:55:28] on the Earth
[1:55:30] you didn't ask if you'd find signs
[1:55:33] or if you'd find miracles
[1:55:35] or churches or music or emotion
[1:55:40] but you said when I come
[1:55:42] well I find faithfulness
[1:55:45] yes Lord I'll answer your question
[1:55:48] tonight you will
[1:55:50] you will because you sent your Prophet
[1:55:53] to turn the hearts of the children back
[1:55:55] to the face of the apostolic fathers
[1:55:59] and when you come there will be a people
[1:56:01] it's if it's a day from now five years
[1:56:03] from now 500 years from now there will
[1:56:05] be a people on the Earth that believe
[1:56:07] your word
[1:56:09] praise God it will be that Omega bride
[1:56:12] oh Jesus we want to be part of it father
[1:56:17] can we just raise our hands in the
[1:56:18] presence of the Lord
[1:56:21] how many once wants God to help you that
[1:56:24] you'll never get that over rebellious
[1:56:25] thing on you
[1:56:27] you'll never exalt what you think or
[1:56:30] what somebody else thinks about the
[1:56:32] scripture or above the Vindicated
[1:56:35] prophet but we just stay with I don't
[1:56:37] understand it by the time my goodness
[1:56:39] friends are so little I do understand
[1:56:40] but I'm going to obey Brothers
[1:56:42] understand it or not well can you
[1:56:44] understand it honestly what's hard to
[1:56:46] understand whenever you say I'm supposed
[1:56:47] to praise him in trial I'll praise him
[1:56:49] in trial if he says women don't wear
[1:56:51] pants and don't wear pants man don't
[1:56:52] wear your hair like a woman well we
[1:56:54] don't do it what's complicated to
[1:56:56] understand about that we just obey what
[1:56:58] he said and it brings God such pleasure
[1:57:01] you think he don't look at us and know
[1:57:03] they're questioning this and they don't
[1:57:05] understand that and yet we do it because
[1:57:07] he said do it that gives him double Joy
[1:57:10] because if you understood it they say
[1:57:12] okay fine you okay I understand that but
[1:57:14] there's much about the word we still
[1:57:16] don't understand and yet we do it with
[1:57:18] all the sincerity of our hearts because
[1:57:21] the word tells us to do it
[1:57:25] my word they cast your name out as evil
[1:57:27] what did Jesus tell us to do reap for
[1:57:30] joy leap for joy
[1:57:33] and be exceeded and good glad for great
[1:57:36] is your reward in heaven
[1:57:38] well when they run you down when they do

[1:57:53] that he didn't ask you to understand
[1:57:55] just ask you to do it
[1:57:57] so in the middle of hell you raise your
[1:57:59] hands and say Lord God I want to thank
[1:58:01] you for blessing me I want to thank you
