Can I tell you why &gt;&gt; I get to go to church? [applause] &gt;&gt; Now, that's not the end of it. I have it on good authority that Jesus is coming to our town and he's coming to our synagogue church and he's going to take the word and he's going to read it and then he's going to expound on it. Can you see why I'm so blessed today? &gt;&gt; Oh, it's wonderful. Let's just go before the Lord. Lord, it'd be different if we if we'd be different if we was just going to church and that would be wonderful. But Lord, you come you come to our church. You you take the word and and you expound it upon your lips and [sighs and gasps] such wonderful things take place. Healing takes place. forgiveness takes place, salvation takes place, mercy. [gasps] Thank you, Lord, for coming to our place today. Lord, we love you so much and so very thankful for the testimonies that you gave out, knowing that you're doing things behind the scenes that we can't even see. But Father, we have these needs today that you knew before we written them on paper with ink that we would have need of them and you'd make a way for them. And all we've got to do is walk in them and believe and be patient and wait on that day that you bring them to pass. Father, [snorts] we thank you so much and for this service and ask you to bless the remainder of it by speaking your word to us of eternal life in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Brother, you come take the offering. Brothers, if you could put healer of the broken pieces. That's in G. You are the healer, healer of my heart. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Maker of the God of all we [music] are. [singing] Sing it. [music] I was [singing] a broken [music] vessel in your hand. You looked [singing] beyond the hurt and made [music] me whole again. [singing] Healer of the broken pieces. [music] You touched my heart and [singing] made it. Now [music and singing] my whole life I surrender. Lay it down before [music] the mener. Lord, I give my heart to you. [music] Love the song before I [singing] knew you. [music] Has brought me near to where you are. [singing] [music] Now I live to praise you. Ever may [music and singing] I praise you neither of mine. [music] Nothing compares [singing] Lord [music] to knowing you [music] and seeing [singing] what the grace of God can [music] do. Aren't you glad he faithfully sought you? You [music] faithfully [singing] sought me [music] and called me your own. You [music] made a way to bring [singing] my wondering heart back [music] home. Oh, healer of the broken [music] pieces. [singing] You touch my heart and made [music] you new. I lift you. Lay it [music] down before the men. [singing] Lord, I give my heart to you. [music] Love this song before I knew [music] has brought me [singing] near to where you are now. I live to [music] praise you ever. May I praise you, healer [singing] of my heart, [music] healer of [singing] the broken pieces. [music] Brother Justin, if you'll come get ready [music] now. My whole [singing] life [music] I surrender. Lay it down before the men. [music] I give my heart to you. [music] Love is on before I [singing] knew. has brought [music] me near to where you [singing] are. Now [music] I live to praise you every [singing] day. I praise you, the healer of my heart. [singing] [music] Yes. Now I live to praise you. Ever [music and singing] may I praise you, the healer of my heart. [singing] God bless you. You can be seated. [applause] Let's give Brother Justin a good hand. Life is [singing] easy when you're up on [singing] the mountain [music] and you've got peace [music and singing] of mind like you've never [singing] known. [music] But then things [singing] change. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; When you're down [singing] in the valley, don't [music and singing] lose faith. For [singing] you're never alone. [music] For the God [singing] on the mountain [music] is still God in the valley. [singing] When [music] things they go wrong, he'll [singing] make them right. And the God of the good times is still God in the bad times. [music] And the God of [singing] the day is still God in the night. [singing] [music] Oh, you talk of victory when you're up on [singing and music] that mountain. Oh, but [music and singing] tall comes so easy when [music] life's [singing] at its best. [music and singing] Oh, but it's down in the valleys of trials and temptations. [singing and music] And that's where faith [music] is put to the test. But I got all the m Mountain [singing] is [music] still God in the valley [singing] [music] when things they go wrong. Oh, he'll make them right. [singing] [music] And the God of the good times [singing] [music] is still God in the bad times. And the God [music and singing] of the day [music] is [singing] still God in the night. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Oh, [music] the God of the day [music] is still God [singing] in the night. [music] Don't nobody get nervous. I'm nervous enough for all of us. After I said I was going to sing this song, I realized the last song I sung was uh I didn't know better think I was getting old. Something about home. And then I decided I was going to sing almost home. But I guess that just goes to show I think a lot about home. Aren't you glad that this world don't make you happy? I don't see how anybody could look at how our world is falling apart. Just look around us and see what's going people going crazy because they think they're not going to get their food this month and they're stealing going in Walmart walking out with stuff. And that's just a little taste of what it's going to be like when they really can't get the food and whatnot. And it's going to be crazy. And I'm glad we're not going to be here. Aren't you glad we're almost home? Are you disappointed? Are you desperate for help? You know what it's like to be tired and only a shell of yourself. But you start to believe you don't have what it takes cuz it's all you can do just to move [music] much less finish the race. But don't [singing] forget what lies ahead. We're almost [singing] home, brother. It won't be long. Soon all our burdens [music] will be gone. [singing] With all your strength, sisters, run [singing] on, run free. Hold up your head. Keep pressing on. [singing] We are almost home. Well, this road will be hard, but we win in the end simply [music] because it's Jesus in us. It's not if, but when. So [music] take joy in the journey even when it seems [singing] long. Find [music] strength in each step knowing heaven is cheering you on. We are almost home. Brother, it [music] won't be long. All our burdens will be gone. [singing] Oh, with all your [music] strength, sister, run [singing] on, run free. Hold up your head. Keep pressing [singing] on. We are almost home. We're almost home. [singing] We're almost home. [singing] [singing] I know [music] that the cross has brought heaven to us. But make no mistake, there's still [music] more to [singing] come when our flesh and our bones are no longer between. Who we are right now and where we're meant to be. Where [music] all has been lost is made whole again. These tears [music] and this pain no longer exists. No more walking. We're running as fast [music] as we can. Consider this our second way. We're almost home, brother. [music] It won't be long. Soon all our burdens [singing] [music] will be gone. [singing] Oh, with all your strength, [music] sister, run on, run free. Hold up your head. Keep pressing on. We are almost home. [singing] We're almost [music] home. We're almost home. We are almost [music] home. Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; I believe we're closer than we think. You know, I was thinking back there if Satan has put such a desperation in this world to like he he was saying people going to breaking into stores and you know all the things that that Satan has put a desperation in this world. I believe God's done the same thing. He's put a desperation in a bride to get out of here. And &gt;&gt; you know, that's that should be our main goal. That should be our our main purpose when we come in here on Sundays, Wednesdays, or whatever it is is our purpose should not be to just come see who's preaching, &gt;&gt; but let's get something that'll give us an extra boost out of here. &gt;&gt; You know, I believe that's what God wants for. And I think so many times as humans, we all do it. We we we miss the purpose of why we're here. while we're here congregating together and you know and instead of listening to what a man has to say, let's come in and think, God, what what can I do to bring me that much closer to getting out of here? You know, so I believe that's, you know, if you're true bride, you're going to be desperate. You're going to be desperate to to get out of here. We're we're so close. We're I don't understand people going this long in the journey, 30, 40, 50 years, whatever, and then finally just quitting. I just I don't I don't understand it. But if you have your Bibles, turn to Hebrews 11. This is a very I'm not going to read the whole Hebrews 11. This you you understand this is the uh the faith heroes of faith chapter. So uh we'll start at verse 35 and read down through 40 and then we'll read the first verse of Hebrews 12. Women received their dead raised to life again. Others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection. Others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, and yay, moreover, of bonds and imprisonment. They were stoned. They were sus, were tempted, were slain in the sword. They wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins, being destitute, afflicted, and tormented. And I want to ask you today, how was your week? &gt;&gt; This was this was their every day. And God said, "Of the whom the world was not worthy, they wandered in deserts and mountains and dens and caves of the earth. And these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise, having God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect." In other words, they're counting on me and you to put on this word to come into the perfection because they can't be perfect without you. Hebrews 12, wherefore, seeing that we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us. Let us run with patience the race that is set before us. Let us pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're so grateful, Father, for this word. We're so grateful, Lord, for a promise. We're so grateful for for you, Lord, that what you've placed inside of us is your life, Lord. That's our hope, our faith, Lord, to get out of here, that whenever the world is turned upside down, Father, as we see it happening today, Father, we don't have to be a part of it because we have a hope of something greater, Lord. And in your word, Lord, we we've seen these that have gone on before now through the church ages, Lord. and and even those in in our time in our day that have crossed over. Lord, without us, they can't be made perfect. Lord, help us this morning to to lay aside anything that would would so easily beset us. Help us to run this race, Father, with desperation, with courage, with faith, Lord, and that we may may obtain the promise that you've set before us. Lord, may you anoint the people here this morning. Touch every need. Lord, we see, Lord, that CO's going around again. Father, may you give healing to to everyone, Father. Every need that's here, every every thing that somebody would had in their mind, Lord, with a raised hand or whatever it may be, Lord, we know that you can fulfill that, Lord. Set me aside, Father, that that I could receive from you, Father, as well as they, Lord, because I know, Lord, if I just stand here and try to to give what's on my notes, Lord, it would just follow on on deaf ears, Father. But if you come, we can apply it to our h our lives, Lord, and to our hearts, and we can live by it. We welcome you in Jesus name. Amen. You can be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; This morning [clears throat] I' I'd like to take a thought that Thank you. I actually got this thought this um past Sunday and studying on all week and it's something worth running for. You know, and that's brother Brandham said in God's provided way. You know, when you when it something worth running for, that's what these these people and these heroes of faith in in chapter 11, you look at what happened to them. You know, you could read the whole chapter and the things that we look at how how they were you look at the fox's book of mortars and all the things that happened to the people of faith back in those days and and it was worth it to them. it it was worth everything they went through to to obtain the promise. And and we look at it and and what they had was was so small to what you and I have have today. And and yet the little bit they had, it was worth it for them to keep running this race. And and Paul tells us in in in we're told in Hebrews to lay aside every weight that so easily beset us. We've got so many things in our life. We got so much things in our in our life that that you know like I said that we could be desperate for. &gt;&gt; You might have a goal in your life in in in your life in your career or whatever it is that's something you've you've set a goal and this is what you want to get by the time you're 35 or or 40 or by the time you graduate college you want to have a a six figure job and and all this and you or you want simple things. You want a family. You want a house. You want different things and and something inside you wants to push you to run for that. There's there's nothing wrong with that when it's in its place. This is something that you feel urged to do. This is what I don't want my family to suffer. I want to get a job that's got great retirement. I want to that gives me a good pension when I'm done and all that. And you and you feel yourself driven for that. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; How much are we driven for things that are eternal? &gt;&gt; IF IF LIFE DRIVES YOU THAT HARD, HOW MUCH MORE SHOULD GOD'S LIFE DRIVE YOU? Is it worth it? It's it's is it's is the FACT THAT WE WE KNOW that in in in the scriptures that that that we're told that the saints that are gone on, they're they're waiting on us. THEY'RE WAITING ON US TO TO REACH this perfection because THEY CAN'T REACH FULL PERFECTION WITHOUT YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham TELLS US IN GOD'S PROVIDED WAY, GRIEVE NOT THE HOLY SPIRIT WHEREBY you are you're sealed until the next revival. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. Until the day of redemption. Is that right? There's no ups and downs, in and outs. You really get into God. &gt;&gt; You have to be into him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU YOU CAN'T RUN FOR ANYTHING IF YOU AIN'T into it. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; There's some things that people do that you don't A lot of guys like to They're into deer hunting. They're into golf. You might be into I don't I don't know. I like deer hunting. [laughter] off, but you might be INTO LITTLE THINGS. IT'S YOUR OWN THING THAT YOU LIKE TO DO AND YOU MIGHT BE into that AND THAT'S WHAT DRIVES YOU. We need to be into God says, but if God if you're really in him, not just impersonating something, you're really in Christ. That's your one alternative. Your whole heart sold out. Every bridge is burnt behind you. You've got your affection set on things that which are above and you run the race with patience. If we don't know what patience is by now, where have we been? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You you we've heard about patience for the last four or five months. &gt;&gt; There's wasp up here. But we look at the heroes of faith. When we read Heb Hebrews 11, this is something that they felt was worth it WHEN THEY HAD TO HIDE IN CAVES. WHEN they they had to they were chased. THEY WERE HUNTED LIKE WILD ANIMALS. Yet they felt like it's worth it. &gt;&gt; It's worth it for FOR MY LIFE TO BE THIS WAY. IT'S WORTH MY LIFE HIDING FOR SOMEBODY TRYING TO KILL ME. &gt;&gt; YEAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; God looks at them and all they went through. All they were going through, they were poor. They were dirty. Probably no place to bathe. They probably weren't eating good because they was running from hiding place to hiding place. They were they were probably had no appetite because they they had already they were in mourning because they they'd seen their loved ones already torn apart, fed to the lions, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And here they are wasting away to nothing. They're smelly. They're stinking. And God looks at them and says, "This entire world is not worthy of these people." &gt;&gt; Amen. What does he say about you? &gt;&gt; When God looks at you in your life and he looks at you and he sees what you're going through. Now, we got to look. They run this race with patience. We have to run it with patience. But we can't so many times cuz we can't get through this one trial cuz your bank account is overdrawn. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We can't get through this trial. this test that's been put upon us, we all these things THAT THIS THAT GOD HAS ALLOWED UPON ME, WE CAN'T EVEN FIND PATIENCE ANYWHERE in it to run. &gt;&gt; This is more important. YOU YOU LOOK AT YOUR TRIAL AND YOUR TRIBULATION AND YOUR MISTAKES AND YOUR FAILURES LIKE IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHAT YOU'RE GAINING GOING through it. &gt;&gt; What does Paul and Peter tell us in the Bible? To glory in it, &gt;&gt; to rejoice in it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at Acts 5 in 40. He says, "And to him they agreed. When they had called the apostles and beaten them, they commanded THAT THEY SHOULD NOT SPEAK IN THE name of Jesus and let them go. They beat them and told him when they let him go, YOU NOT TO PREACH JESUS ever again cuz worse will come upon you." Boy, they showed them, didn't they? and they left and they went their way and they never mentioned Jesus ever again. &gt;&gt; It's the law. The law the law provi prevents me from from reading my Bible. The the law prevents me from doing this. The law prevent that wasn't their attitude. &gt;&gt; They departed from the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame. &gt;&gt; THEY GOT EXCITED BECAUSE THEY WERE PERSECUTED. THEY GOT EXCITED BECAUSE this is what Christ went through. I GET TO SHARE THAT WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; I GET TO SHARE THEIR SHAME. THEY WENT THEIR WAY REJOICING AND THEY PREACHED HIS NAME EVEN MORE. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; And daily in the temple, in every house, they ceased not to teach and to preach Jesus Christ. That's what your life SHOULD BE DOING EVERY DAY, teaching and preaching Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's when God looks at you and says, "The world is not worthy of you." &gt;&gt; Because you have a life that is teaching Christ. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; In Romans, Paul tells us that that we glory in our tribulations, knowing that suffering produces endurance. When you suffer, that helps you to endure more. &gt;&gt; Suffering brings endurance. What does endurance bring? Endurance brings character. &gt;&gt; That's what you're taking with you. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham SAID THIS. THE ONLY THING YOU'LL TAKE IN THIS LIFE IS your character. Endurance. Endurance in what? Endurance in your suffering. &gt;&gt; That's the character God's molding in you. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE CHARACTER that that you SAYS THIS IS WORTH RUNNING FOR. &gt;&gt; This is what I'M TRYING TO OBTAIN. THIS IS WHAT I'M GOING TO GET. &gt;&gt; God gives you endurance. Why do you need endurance? cuz it's going to get worse. &gt;&gt; There's more coming. &gt;&gt; But that endurance brings character. &gt;&gt; Character brings hope. &gt;&gt; What's the hope for? The finish line. &gt;&gt; That's what you're running for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's where you're going. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you if you can't endure, if you can't endure, you won't produce a character that character will tell you. If you have the right kind of character, you look at runners, well, their whole character is, I'll never quit. I'll never stop. I don't care how long it takes. &gt;&gt; All their training, their whole life IS IS IS BUILT AROUND a finish line. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why THEY TRAIN. THAT'S WHY THEY RUN all the time. It's not to see how far, how how long, how this their their goal is the finish line. &gt;&gt; When you go to run a 5K, THERE'S A LOT OF YOU GUYS and you gals in here that run. You're you're not in that race to beat to win the entire race. You know it. I know it. EVERYBODY KNOWS IT. I've seen you run. You've seen me run once. But the WHOLE THING THAT IS BUILT AROUND THAT'S THE FINISH LINE. WHO ARE YOU RUNNING AGAINST? YOU'RE RUNNING AGAINST YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; You're running against the things of humanity. You push YOURSELF TO PLACES YOU'VE NEVER BEEN BEFORE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU ENDURE TO A SPOT THAT YOU SAID, "THE LAST RACE I RUN, I I REACHED HERE. THIS NEXT ONE, I'M going further." &gt;&gt; IT'S THE FINISH LINE. WHY? YOU HAVE PEOPLE AT THE END OF THAT FINISH LINE WAITING ON YOU, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; THEY AIN'T GIVING YOU HIGH FIVE A MILE BEFORE the race. They ain't saying, "Yeah, YOU DONE IT." A MILE OR TWO BEFORE THE END OF THE RACE. &gt;&gt; They're at the finish line. You have people there this MORNING THAT'S ENCOURAGING YOU. WE ARE COMPASSED ABOUT BY A CLOUD OF WITNESSES. YEAH. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY THAT'S MENTIONED IN HEBREWS 11 is cheering you on. &gt;&gt; They're not hoping you make it. &gt;&gt; THEY KNOW THE SAME GOD THAT STAYED WITH THEM WHEN THEY WERE HIDING, WHEN THEY WERE BEING ripped apart, WHEN THEY WERE BEING TORTURED. The same God is the one that's driving you. So they know that YOU'LL REACH THAT PLACE, BUT THEY ALSO KNOW they have to go through things like we did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't lose faith. &gt;&gt; DON'T GET TO THE SPOT IN YOUR LIFE, I CAN'T DO IT NO MORE. &gt;&gt; Your heart was never in it. &gt;&gt; Your mind was. &gt;&gt; If you play mind games, you ask some of these people that that run. When your mind starts telling you you can't, &gt;&gt; you're looking for a place to stop and walk. &gt;&gt; You're looking for a place of rest. &gt;&gt; People are resting after 40 years. &gt;&gt; People are resting after 50 years. THEY FOUND A NICE SPOT ON THE SIDE OF THE trail &gt;&gt; to sit down. &gt;&gt; Once you stop, once you stop, it's hard to get started back. Ain't it, brother Timmy? ONCE YOU STOP, THEM LEGS QUIT MOVING. &gt;&gt; It's hard to get started back. &gt;&gt; Why? Because everything around you begins to look good. &gt;&gt; That gentle breeze that you're feeling now feels good. &gt;&gt; But you're in a race. You're in a race. You have something worth running for. And I believe every once in a while, God gives us glimpse through this message of what we're running for. &gt;&gt; You had a seventh day messenger go beyond the curtain of time and and says, "Whatever you do, whatever you do, you don't want to miss that. &gt;&gt; Don't miss that." &gt;&gt; Peter tells us, encourages the believers, DON'T BE SURPRISED AT THE FIERY TRIAL. Don't let it surprise you because it's coming. &gt;&gt; And many of us can attest to that. We've had trials. We we've had things. We've lost loved ones. We've we've we've had failure in our lives. We've we've done things in our lives and and we've seen God bring us through that. &gt;&gt; So don't be surprised BECAUSE WHAT WHAT DID PAUL SAY? It's building character. &gt;&gt; It's it's character molding. SO DON'T BE SURPRISED. YOU CAN'T BE A runner and not have training. &gt;&gt; Training hurts worse than the race sometimes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Getting prepared for a certain run in your life. It was Justin was singing. It's so easy when you're on on the mountain mountain top and it's you're just going. It's easy sailing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But then when you get down in the valley, things go wrong. The terrain is is tough down there. There's fallen trees. There's all kinds of things in your life, &gt;&gt; but you can't get to the mountaintop until you first go through that. &gt;&gt; That's the only way up to the top. &gt;&gt; And when you GET TO THE TOP, GUESS WHAT? THERE'S ANOTHER SIDE OF that mountain and it's going to take you right back down. So don't be surprised when you end up in another valley. &gt;&gt; Amen. PETER SAYS, "DO NOT BE SURPRISED AT THE FIERY TRIAL WHICH COMES UPON YOU TO TEST you as though something strange was happening to you." &gt;&gt; This is not strange. We We know that God's people go through tests and trials. It's happened in every age. Leoty is no different. &gt;&gt; You're not exempt from test and trials because you're in the age of the rapture. God is going to let you sit on that little soft cushy mattress. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; God said, "I am God. I change not. &gt;&gt; I change not. If I put them through it, I'm going to put you through it. &gt;&gt; So the heroes of faith, they're urging us to lay aside everything that would hinder us. You're living in the day that they wanted to see. &gt;&gt; This is the day that they wanted to see. That's why they're urging you on. They knew this was the last day. They they also heard Jesus say, "Well, I'm going away." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You marvel at the works that they marveled at the works that Jesus did. And Jesus said, "Greater things than this shall you do." They wanted to see those greater things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of them, they probably didn't think it was a greater thing by by being burnt to burn at the state. They probably didn't think it was a greater thing to have to be beheaded. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. Amen. SOMETIMES IT DON'T FEEL LIKE A GREATER THING TO YOU WHEN you're going through your trial. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Jesus, YOU WE WE TAKE GOD BACK TO HIS OWN WORD. SO many times we we we try to take God back to his word. I can't believe I'm going through this. God, you said in your word, if we had fa faith the size of a GRAIN OF A MUSTARD SEED, ANYTHING WE SAY THAT you would remove it, Lord, take this off of me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. I think we should be praying for God's understanding more than for God to take something off you because there might be a an eternal purpose that God is putting something on you, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But we want to throw the WORD BACK IN GOD'S FACE. GOD, YOU SAID BELIEVERS, LAY HANDS ON THE SICK AND THEY SHALL RECOVER. &gt;&gt; That's that's the way I I I look at the passing of our loved ones. They got the ultimate eternal recovery. &gt;&gt; They shall recover. There's you, you know, you you look look at the the people that that's passed on. They're not suffering no more. &gt;&gt; They have what we're trying to get to. &gt;&gt; They have what we're trying to gain. &gt;&gt; I I I can't I can't put myself in in in your shoes. I can't empathize with you cuz, you know, I still have my parents. I have them all my brothers and my siblings by God's grace. &gt;&gt; But I can tell you what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That they're in a greater place. and and this this place that there's they're waiting on you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think so often we miss that. Brother Brandham said in Jehovah Gyra, "Our heavenly father, we think, we thank thee for what our eyes have seen, our ears have heard, the revelation of Jesus Christ to his people and have the priv privilege of living in this day that all the patriarchs and prophets, apostles, great men and years gone have longed to see this day. They could only rise on the scene, THESE ANCIENT PROPHETS, and see the very thing that that they saw in them years now being done. What an am and evangelistic services that would be locked in jails. Call them crazy people. We live in the day to see all of this that they saw by faith. God, let us take the opportunity while it's present to us. They are depending on us. They left their word, the word of God that was shown to them. They're depending on us to carry it out. Jesus came to confirm it, to send the Holy Spirit to continue the work and give us power to work by till these things should be finished. And then the great ransom church of the living God shall be caught up to meet him. &gt;&gt; They can't win the race without you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They they It's not in cross country. I I did run for one year, believe it or not. I wanted to get out of world history. So, it was available. [snorts] &gt;&gt; But as a team, to get a team win, everybody has to cross. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a team effort. &gt;&gt; They they've ran their leg. &gt;&gt; You're the anchor. &gt;&gt; You You are the anchor. There's no there's no trophies. There's no rewards, no nothing being handed out until you cross. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, let's not delay. Let's not look at the scenery around us and not let's not let's not think in our mind, I you know, I'm I'm tired. I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR so long. I'm tired now. I don't I can't don't feel like I'm going anywhere. That's the mind. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's the mind. But the soul, the soul is what's running. &gt;&gt; The soul is what's pulling you on. The soul, your you have the same thing in here that they have. And they have to connect. They have to meet up at the finish line. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We cross the finish line as a team. That's what Paul said. The dead and Christ shall rise first and then we that are alive and remain shall meet them in the air. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We meet them. We be we come together with them because we finish together. &gt;&gt; I'm sure if we could hear him this morning, they'd be urging us to run with everything we got. &gt;&gt; In the token, there came from the body of our Lord Jesus Christ, water, blood, and life. And the whole church, the bride together has been made up through justification, sanctification, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost, which is the token. As Hebrews 11 says, all those all these who wandered about in sheep skkins and goat skins were destitute and all these things that they done yet was not made perfect without us. And the church in this day, they've received the token of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. That's the blood has been shed. That's the Holy Ghost is upon the church. Without us, they cannot raise. But they're depending on us for God promised he would have it. And somebody is going to be there. I don't know who it's going to be. I hope it's me. I'm believing it's me. &gt;&gt; Somebody h from this age has to meet them. &gt;&gt; It's going to be me. &gt;&gt; I don't know who it's going to be. Somebody's going to receive it. The only thing that I'm responsible is to preach it. It's God's business to look look out for that predestinated seed. There's going to be there because there's going to be each one of them one with the other. The water age, the blood age, and now the token age of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; They had a revelation. They had a revelation back then of what was at the finish line. That's that's why they ran so hard. That's why they saw that this was worth running for. This was a race. They they they were they raised up their hands and said, "I'll go. &gt;&gt; I I know what lays before me. I know what they did to Christ. I know what they did to Peter. I know what they did to Paul AND THE DISCIPLES. I'LL GO ANYWAY." &gt;&gt; AMEN. You know, we if I read it one time, I'll probably never read it again because it's it's it's so it's so depressing. But if you read read the Fox's book of martyrs, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; there's a lot of accounts and there's other accounts that that that some other writers back in the them um 15th, 16th, 17th century wrote about the martyrs and and there one is about this this man named Nick Nicomeus. They they had Nicomeus there and they they put him on the rack and first they told him they said you need to denounce Christ and sacrifice to to this God or to this or whatever. And he said, "I'll never do it. I'll never do it." He he knew the rack was was waiting him. So they put him on the rack and they begin, Brother Donnie talked about it here a week or two ago. They began to stretch him out. &gt;&gt; Yeah. They stretched him out and pulled it harder and harder and finally he recanted. &gt;&gt; He recanted in in in some of the writing says that when they let him loose that the devil come upon him and he began to beat his head up on the ground, ended up dying right there. And there's a 16-year-old girl. I want youth to listen to me a minute. There's a 16year-old girl named Denisa. When she saw that he recanted, it says she yelled out. There was a crowd of people there and she yelled out, "You miserable wretch. &gt;&gt; You traded. You traded a a an eternity." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; For a moment, one single moment without pain. As soon as they took him off, he died. He recanted Christ and he died. &gt;&gt; So there's one of the the soldiers there that was around there, they said, "Are you a Christian?" She said, THEY SAID SHE SCREAMED OUT, "YES, I AM." And what they did to her, the writings say that they gave her to two soldiers and they took her in a house and they tried to have their way with her all night. and she fought him off all night and when she couldn't fight no more. The figure in white walked into the room. &gt;&gt; The two soldiers gave their life to Christ. &gt;&gt; They killed all three of them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But to her, it was worth it. You know, and I don't take lightly that you young sisters sometimes get made fun of for wearing a skirt, long hair, no makeup. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You didn't go through that. &gt;&gt; They thought that was worth it. &gt;&gt; A long skirt, sisters, should be worth it. &gt;&gt; Modest apparel, &gt;&gt; a clean heart, a clean face &gt;&gt; should be worth it. Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter the shame that's put upon you here. It's when eternal glory is put upon you over there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we're running to. &gt;&gt; Don't Don't quit running because somebody made fun of you. &gt;&gt; DON'T DON'T THINK IT'S NOT WORTH IT. AND I KNOW YOU COME HOME FROM SCHOOL or you come home from your job or whatever and you go to your room and you cry and you cuz people are making fun of you. You think I can't take it no more. I can't run like this no more. You keep it inside. You don't talk to nobody. You don't tell nobody. And all the while, [snorts] God says you're building endurance. &gt;&gt; Your endurance is building character. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Your character's giving you hope. &gt;&gt; Giving you hope. As we said here a couple weeks ago, making fun of people, talking about you, the things that you go through, it's just a a little second compared to what you gain. Is this one little second that you go through? Is it not worth it? &gt;&gt; Is it not worth running this race? Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's others that there's others that are coming up behind you are going to go through the same thing and God's given you a testimony. &gt;&gt; You know, I' I've been to races. I I go watch the the people here race and I watch them and I think, man, I wish I could run like that. I can't. I'm almost 60. So, I like to admire Timmy and others to get out and run, you know, and so, you know, and Tim Murray, Lord, he's older than me and dude can run. They let him out of the nursing home to go run 5Ks. But you look at that and there's people there there's young people that are 10, 12, 13 years old that are watching your LIFE &gt;&gt; AND THEY'RE SAYING, "I WANT TO RUN LIKE THAT. &gt;&gt; I want to be like them." [snorts] But you flip that on the other spectrum. If you're not living right, you're still creating a testimony. If you're if you're cheating a little bit on your your skirts and you're you're putting a little makeup here, you're you're reading things you probably shouldn't be reading and doing little different things. There's little ones that's wanting to run &gt;&gt; and you might be their hero. &gt;&gt; They they might want to be like you. &gt;&gt; You don't want to get on that on the other side the day of judgment and you be accountable for souls going to hell. &gt;&gt; That's true. because they looked at your life. They wanted to run like you &gt;&gt; and that's what they ran to. &gt;&gt; It's a sobering thought. It's something that we should think about. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; You know, [snorts] human nature tries to make us slow down. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's tough. Come home from work, things happening. Maybe you the job you're on is getting ready to end. You don't know and you just you don't see the end of it. Things happen in your life and it's so easy to slow down this race. It's so easy. You know, I I was studying this last night. I had all these notes and I went back in there and put this in there because I [snorts] got to thinking about Peter because so often we look at the mistakes in our failures in our life. We we look at things that we've done and listen we've all sinned and fell short of the glory of the God of God. Right? We've all we've came into the world speaking lies. We've born and shaped in iniquity. Your human flesh, even if you have the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; this flesh will fail you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? You you you're not in a glorified body. &gt;&gt; So, let's get that out of the way. There ain't no If anybody in here is in a glorified body, the rapture is getting ready to happen &gt;&gt; cuz it's probably one of your loved ones &gt;&gt; cuz it ain't none of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we make mistakes. We make failures and and we stumble. There's there's some of the greatest runners in the world end up not finishing. They give up for one reason or the other. And and so many times we we slow down. We begin to look at I did this and sometimes some people might say the sin that I committed is is worse than in God's eyes it's all sin &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; God don't look at you for doing one thing that you you think that is is worse than somebody else God just said sin is sin &gt;&gt; I'm going to punish you more because you did this and then I'm going to punish him because his wasn't so bad &gt;&gt; God don't look at it that way sin is sin and so many times Satan is the one that magnifies it in our mind. &gt;&gt; We begin to slow down. We begin to look at these faults and these failures in our lives and we begin to slow down. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; How how can I be a Christian if I did this? How can I have the Holy Ghost if if I did that this, you know? And imagine when Peter's running to the tomb that day. I wonder if Peter began to think because the Bible says that John outran him. Was John faster or does Peter just begin to think? &gt;&gt; I denied him. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I lied to him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I cursed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I I told him I'd never leave him, never forsake him. He's standing there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I told people, "I don't know this man." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And all this Peter's running. I want to see him. I WANT TO SEE HIM. I I WANT TO I want to hug him. I want to I can't believe I did that. &gt;&gt; What's he going to do to me? &gt;&gt; What's he going to do to me for all that I done? And then the Bible tells us when when they think Peter gets to scene, Jesus never mentioned it. &gt;&gt; Jesus never said, "Peter, why did you deny me?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why did you lie TO ME? I WAS THERE for you the whole time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Why did you lie? [snorts] Why did you say you didn't know me? What did Jesus tell him? Peter, go feed my sheep. &gt;&gt; I'm putting a ministry on you, Peter. &gt;&gt; That's what I think of you. I want you to spread my word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's what I think of you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want you to feed. I want you to prepare my people for the finish line. &gt;&gt; That's what he thought of Peter. That's what he thinks of you. &gt;&gt; When you get to thinking, I've done this and you've repented. Lord, you know the you're required to repent one time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; One time. &gt;&gt; People go a lifetime repenting of the same thing. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Over and over. And sometimes they can't help it because there's there's people that keep reminding them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, you did this. You did that. &gt;&gt; Be careful whose sins you're reminding people of. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You might find yours worse. &gt;&gt; We have to run together. We're we're in this race together. It's this is not a a me and and and and no more and all that. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; The prize is perfection. And that's what that's what they're counting on us. The people that get tired of of of running, they they've never caught their second wind. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They never caught a second wind. How many knows what a second wind is? &gt;&gt; I decided to do some research on the second wind. And sports scientists say that second wind a lot of times has to do a lot with what you eat. &gt;&gt; It's what you eat. Your body builds up what they call lactic acids. And lactic acid will will pull you down, drag you down, and and make you feel like you can't push through this brick wall that you're in front of you. &gt;&gt; But if you eat the right things, it breaks down that lac that lactic acid and it produces energy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then you've get something that comes over you. &gt;&gt; You feel like you can run forever. &gt;&gt; You pick the pace up. You have more energy. You think more positive. &gt;&gt; There's no stopping you. &gt;&gt; That's what happened in the upper room. &gt;&gt; They they were running. They They had been running for a while, for 40 days or however long it was, but unless they got that second wind that came through the upper room, they weren't going to finish. That's &gt;&gt; right. Unless you get the second win, the Holy Ghost, you're not going to finish. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; The only one that finishes this race is those that have got the second wind, the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; How do you get it? It's what you eat. &gt;&gt; What are you feeding on? &gt;&gt; WHAT WHAT'S IN YOUR DIET? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You have to these these people that run the the the Boston Marathons and these these big huge marathons, they have a strict diet. Their diets consist of vitamin B's and magnesium and potassium and calcium according to what I read. This is not my own knowledge. And this is things that they put in their diet and and and this is strategic to how they run. &gt;&gt; You've been given A DIET ON HOW TO RUN. &gt;&gt; You've been given a a a recipe as it were &gt;&gt; that says eat this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This will sustain you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's so much that comes with it. &gt;&gt; When you eat this diet and you become one with this, you get your second wind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I remember [snorts] when I was running cross country in Kentucky. I was a freshman. I I was not fast by any stretch of the imagination, even worse than that. [snorts] But I I wouldn't stop. I didn't I I refused to stop. My dad was in the Marines and some of our punishments sometimes he'd make us run. &gt;&gt; I was like, "Man, dad, whip me and get it over with." But he would make us run and he would run all the time. And [snorts] so that was one thing in my that I had determined I'm I'm not stopping. There was never a cross country meet that ever went to that I didn't finish ever. Sometimes I might have been near the back of the pack or at the back. I didn't care. I wasn't I knew I wasn't going to win the race. &gt;&gt; But I was racing against me. &gt;&gt; And this this course is not going to beat me. I'm going to finish it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we had a we had a a senior on our team named Billy Parker. And Billy Parker was top 10 in the state. He had a 5-3 mile [snorts] and we'd be we would be practicing. We we would run around the the baseball field, football field and everything was all fenced in and we would run around it. We would we did 3.6 miles a a day in in a training day like every other day, whatever. Billy Parker would lap me before I got one lap in. Billy Parker didn't leave me. Billy Parker would pull his jersey out. Say, "Joe, grab my jersey. Grab my jersey." When I reached out and grabbed Billy Parker's jersey, first of all, what gave me a little bit of energy was the fact that he took interest in me. &gt;&gt; You say, "Joe, grab my jersey. and you keep my pace. &gt;&gt; For some reason, when I had hold of that jersey, I knew Billy Parker was pulling me into that pace. I knew I wasn't keeping it. And he would run and I would get faster long as I was holding that jersey. &gt;&gt; You know, and when I was studying this, all this started coming back to me. And I always I've thought of Billy Parker for many years just for that reason that he was willing to help me. You know, I got to thinking how many times in our life we see somebody struggling [snorts] trying to to get a leg up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Trying to Let me Let me tell you something. Jesus said, "Narrow is the way. &gt;&gt; Straight is the gate. Narrow is the way. Few there be that find it." It it ain't easy. &gt;&gt; Amen. This this life is is is this this race that you're running is not an easy race. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THAT'S WHY SOME PEOPLE WANT TO SIT DOWN. THAT'S WHY SOME PEOPLE CAN'T get but they never get NOBODY TO PULL A JERSEY OUT AND hand it to them. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Grab them up. &gt;&gt; You can't tell me with five, six hundred people, there's no telling how many people are struggling &gt;&gt; spiritually. How often do we DO WE SAY GRAB A HOLD? &gt;&gt; Grab a hold. &gt;&gt; We'll [snorts] finish this together. &gt;&gt; But you're just worried about you and your own and nobody else. You want to be the most spiritual person in church. You want to be the first one here. You want to sit on the front row. You want to show how much you know. Have you helped anybody? Come on. &gt;&gt; Have you helped anybody that can't run? You haven't seen them in two or three weeks in church. Have you called him? &gt;&gt; It's a struggle. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Leodysa is not easy. &gt;&gt; It's made for eternal beings. &gt;&gt; Leodysia, this was an age for eternal beings. &gt;&gt; God made manifest. You you are the you are what what [snorts] the the the mages wanted to see. They wanted to see God fully manifest in a human being and bring that human being to perfection. Brother Brandham said you are his perfection. That's what they wanted to see. They didn't get to see it. &gt;&gt; They didn't they didn't get they didn't live to see it. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; But here you are EVERY MORNING YOU WAKE UP AND YOU GO LOOK in the mirror. you and you look in the mirror and and and and if you look at yourself spiritually, you this nice lean steady runner. &gt;&gt; That's the way God looks at you. Let's start helping others on our team. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because without them, you will not be perfected. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can run off and leave them all you want. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; You can leave them all you want. If you do, I question, are you going to are you going to cross the finish line? &gt;&gt; If you're willing to leave others behind, &gt;&gt; are you going to cross? &gt;&gt; That that's why I I struggle with people's favorite preacher. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's my favorite preacher. I can't get nothing from him. I because it's all depends on what you're expecting, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You've already formed an expectation before you whenever you found out who was preaching. You've already formed an expectation. Come on. &gt;&gt; Sorry, but that's the truth. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. Instead of saying, "I I don't care if if there's a fence post up here preaching. If I have a need, God, let that fence post &gt;&gt; speak to my need." [applause] &gt;&gt; But I always thought people said, "This preacher, this my favorite preacher, this this my what if your preacher don't make it? &gt;&gt; What if he don't make it in?" &gt;&gt; True. So many So many people have fallen because their favorite preacher has fallen. That's right. &gt;&gt; So many people have bailed out of the race because their preacher has bailed out of the race. &gt;&gt; I'm not following brother Donnie. &gt;&gt; I'm following the Christ he's presenting to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's following the same Christ. [applause] &gt;&gt; It's a message. It's it's what what every pastor in this message should be bringing forth to the people is Christ. &gt;&gt; That's what brother brother Donnie has has told the ministers so many times in preach Christ. &gt;&gt; Preach Christ. Don't preach brother Donnie. Don't preach brother Brandon. &gt;&gt; Don't preach brother Daryl, brother David Soler. YOU DON'T PREACH THAT. YOU PREACH CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to skip some here. Brother Brandham said, "Show us the father." [snorts] Don't you know, brethren, we ought to be leaning against one another. Leaning on one another to make shade for one another, trying to help one another. Not trying to condemn each other, but trying to make a little shade, a little gospel shade to stand in. For it's a weary time that we're living. &gt;&gt; So, we all know what the word Christian. I'm not going, please don't nobody raise your hand. If I asked who's a Christian, most of all y'all would raise your hand. &gt;&gt; No doubt. &gt;&gt; And then I would say, "How many in here is Christlike?" &gt;&gt; Fewer would probably raise your hand because you automatically soon as I would say, "Who in here is Christlike?" Satan would flood your mind. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I've done this, so that can't be Christlike. I've done that. So, but you just said you were a Christian. &gt;&gt; To be a Christian is to be Christlike. &gt;&gt; And and that's that's not to decize anybody. That's just putting us all in one whole lump here. It's not about what we think. &gt;&gt; It's not about what we do. It's about what God sees in us. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're living all you know how despite your faults and failures, that's what the blood was for. &gt;&gt; That's what the blood when God looks at you, he sees Christlike. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason why I say that is is helping each other. I'm going to wind down here. But Paul tells us when you when you read Tim second Timothy and if I'm jumping fellers, I apologize. You read second Timothy 4 and this the scriptures 7 and 8 where Paul says, "I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course. I have kept the faith. His fourth laid up for me a crown of righteousness which is [snorts] uh which the Lord, the righteous judge shall give me at that day." He hasn't got it yet. He's waiting on you &gt;&gt; to give me at that day. Not to me only, but unto them that love his appearing. &gt;&gt; Understand what Paul says in verse 7. He says, "I have finished my course." Paul did not say, "I won the race." &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "I won it. &gt;&gt; I finished it." &gt;&gt; He wins when we win. Amen. &gt;&gt; When we cross, &gt;&gt; Paul wins the race. &gt;&gt; You're racing against your flesh. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says [clears throat] in the influence of another, and I I've had this quote many, many years ago over at the old church. I think brother Donnie read it here last year or something. When you're playing a ball game, as it's football season, the the thing we want to do is not everybody try to take the ball away from the man that's got it. &gt;&gt; He is trying to guard that man, protect him, let him get through. We're trying to make a goal. See, could you imagine a team so untrained as to find one man, their own man with the ball running to the field goal, and instead of trying to knock the en enemy away from him, the opposing team, to let your own man that's got the ball take off with it? Every man is trying to take the ball out of his hand, you're bound to lose. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Today, we have the same thing. When we see God come on the scene trying to bless a certain thing, let's keep all the enemies away from it. Let's use our influence as tackles, not runners. Tackles that protects the runners. Let him pack the ball, though, because [clears throat] there's no opposition. All he has to do is keep running. We should be tackles. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad brother Brandham kind of understood football a little bit, &gt;&gt; but that's our job. Everybody wants to run the ball. Everybody wants to be the one that gets the glory. &gt;&gt; We We've all got our place in this race. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've all got a position to fulfill. &gt;&gt; When you have a relay race, you got one that starts two in the middle. You got to anchor. Usually your anchor is the fastest guy. Everybody wants to be the anchor. Nobody wants wants to be the first guy because if if he gets left behind. Everybody behind him has got to play catchup. &gt;&gt; Everybody wants to be the last guy. Everybody wants to be the running back. Everybody wants to be the quarterback. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God might just want you to be a fan in the stands. &gt;&gt; You can't you can't have a football game without the fans. &gt;&gt; There's got to be support. There's got to be people cheering on. Come on, Gord. &gt;&gt; There. There's got to be people there that's flying your colors. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. &gt;&gt; Flying your banner. &gt;&gt; And it's you. It's me. It It's Everybody wants to be the pastor. Everybody wants to be a deacon or A TRUSTEE AND ALL THAT. It It takes every position. &gt;&gt; THIS CHURCH IS NOT COMPLETE without you. &gt;&gt; Every position in it. If you don't do anything but come in here half hour before service and you pray and read your Bible, you're an intricate part of what this happen what happens in the service &gt;&gt; because you came in and you approached GOD AND TOLD GOD WHAT YOUR NEED WAS. You said you told God that there's other needs here. &gt;&gt; In fact, you might be the only one that done it. &gt;&gt; We all have a part to play. We all have a position &gt;&gt; to fulfill. So we look at the prodal, the prodical son in Luke 15:18. The prodal says, "I will arise and go to my father and I and will say unto the father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee and am no more worthy to be called thy son. Make me as one of thy hired servants." And he arose and came to his father. But when he was yet a far way off, his father saw him, had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. That word ran is of persons in haste of those who run in a raceourse. Metaphorically a a doctrine rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap rap RAPIDLY PROPAGATED BY A METAPHOR taken from runners in a race to exert oneself to spend one's strength in performing to attain something to denotes to incur extreme peril and that's what the father felt not the son. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; this is what was going through the father when his son saw his son. Now I want you to put yourself in here. He saw his son returning home. He could have said, "Slam the gates." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Don't let him in here. &gt;&gt; I've gave him everything and he wasted it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We don't want him back. &gt;&gt; He's in fact he don't even have my name anymore. But he didn't do that. THE BIBLE SAYS HE RAN. He exerted himself &gt;&gt; to incur extreme peril to strive to obtain. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you get what I'm saying here? THAT'S WHAT GOD DID FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He ran to you. &gt;&gt; You didn't run to him, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You didn't have the right kind of energy to run to him. &gt;&gt; You didn't have a second wind. You would have never made it. &gt;&gt; But God looked at you and your state. When you come back, what what do we look at this? He had nothing. When he come back, he'd wasted everything. He smelt like pigs. He was dirty. All he had was the clothes that was on his back. &gt;&gt; The Bible says he wasted everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's when God took you back when you had nothing left. &gt;&gt; You had nothing left. You had nowhere to go, nowhere to turn. &gt;&gt; And God takes out at a dead sprint to you &gt;&gt; when he's seen you a way a ways off. The Bible never says that the the prodal saw his father a way off. &gt;&gt; The father saw him &gt;&gt; and he ran. He exerted himself. &gt;&gt; In other words, I'll reach you or die. &gt;&gt; That's how God got to got to you. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; What are we running to? We're running to an eternal life. an eternal city. And you were the very reason it was made. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It was made for you. You know what? I was thinking of this and we we we've mentioned it a time or two. Let's stand together. You know, we we talk about how how the angels react when we get over there. You know it how brother Brandham talked about how they will circled circle the earth as the bride sings her song of redemption because they they don't understand that song. We sing Amazing Grace. How sweet this sound. Angels can't sing that. But I wonder how they react when you, the bride, walks into that front gate. Angels are getting ready to see you like they've never seen you before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you cross the finish line, they've never seen you in the perfect image of God in a glorified body. You've run this race. But the problem is, you know, these angels have seen you at your worst. And many times I wonder if if they've questioned God, God, why are you put up with them? Why do you why do you do that? &gt;&gt; Look what they're doing. You You've gave them chance after chance after chance and hear that they still are. They come in and they they hear you preach this and how they're doing this and they do it anyway and they they they come back and they they skip for two or three weeks and then they COME BACK. GOD, WHY do you do? [snorts] But I came to rest assured when you walking through that gate them angels tunes going to change. They're going to get excited BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO SCREAM OUT, "SHE'S HERE. SHE'S HERE. SHE'S FINALLY MADE IT." &gt;&gt; THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THE SAME ONE THAT THEY ENCOURAGE GOD TO CHASTISE. &gt;&gt; THE SAME ONE THAT GOD WELL, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? WHY ARE YOU LETTING THEM BY with this? &gt;&gt; Cuz they didn't have the same kind of love for you that God's got. &gt;&gt; She's crossed the finish line. She's entered into that city and now when she gets they get there, they're going to be in awe of you. Angels, eternal beings are going to be in awe of you. &gt;&gt; Our our human minds can't comprehend. That's why brother Brandon encourages to whatever you do, don't miss it. I can't he can't said I can't even describe it. Human words are not ascri be able to describe any of it. But when they look at you, they get to see the one that God longed for for so many years, for thousands and thousands and thousands of years, eons of time. This was God's divine purpose when he opened his mouth and said, "Let there be." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This is what it was. Amen. &gt;&gt; You in a glorified body walking through the pearly gates, the finish line. You know, we we we got loved ones that's over there. Many of you lost loved ones and that's I'm sure encouraging you to keep going. You know, but in this we we look at life as it was and we get sad, we grieve and you know, like I I did uh brother Bob Leven's funeral, you know, and I told the family, you know, people say, you know, don't grieve. You know, it I say grieve. You have to grieve. Grief is is is is words of love that you didn't get to speak to him anymore. And I know God puts grief in your heart, but he makes that hole just big enough to where peace and comfort lays right beside grief. &gt;&gt; But they're not here no more. &gt;&gt; They're they're they're waiting for us to finish so they could finish. But if if if I I could speak to you this morning, if if if we could hear brother Jimmy Babs, Sister Erica, Brother Daniel Nutley, Sister Sharon Ward, different ones, Brother Steve Newsome, those that have went on, they're screaming out. Don't stop. &gt;&gt; Don't you quit running. &gt;&gt; You where I'M AT RIGHT NOW, YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS THIS. AND THAT WHERE THEY'RE AT RIGHT NOW IS NOT GOD'S FULL GLORY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Where they're at is peace. It's comfort. It's love. It's endless love. &gt;&gt; But God says, "Oh, I've got more for you than that. &gt;&gt; You've got your second wind right here. You're going to cross the finish line one more dimension." Brother Harry, &gt;&gt; we're almost there. &gt;&gt; If I could encourage you this morning, if you don't get nothing out of anything that I preach this morning, don't quit running. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't sit down. Amen. &gt;&gt; I know you get discouraged. That's the spirit of Leoa. Discouragement. &gt;&gt; You're lukewarm and I would spew you OUT OF MY MOUTH BECAUSE you you were either hot where you were either hot or cold. THAT'S WHAT GOD SAID ABOUT THIS AGE. WHETHER YOU WERE HOT OR COLD, but now we're in the middle. WE GO TO CHURCH JUST WHEN IT'S CONVENIENT. &gt;&gt; We read our BIBLE AND WE PRAY WHEN HARD TIMES COME. WHEN EVERYTHING'S GOOD, we're just skating along like, "Oh, well. Let's run this race like they did in the first church age. Desperation. &gt;&gt; Desperation. You'll never see your loved ones again if you don't get desperate. &gt;&gt; That's the spirit of this bride is desperation to get out of here. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, I I know we're living in a time, Father, that it's hard sometimes. We know there's a squeeze coming on this bride, Lord. And maybe it's here. Maybe it's the first part of it. I don't I don't know. You know that more than any of us, Lord. And you you will bring it to us through your word as you see fit. But when it comes, you'll give us strength. Lord, every leg of this journey, Father, you have something for us in every part of it. Whenever we get tired, we feel like we want to quit. We feel like we get bogged down and we can't run. But Lord, there's something worth running for. If we could keep that in our hearts, if we could keep that in our minds, Lord Jesus, that that there is something at the end of this race that we don't want to miss instead of focusing on the things around us that's trying to drag us down. Lord, I pray that you would touch every heart here, every need here, Lord. Lord, I know we get slow, but Lord, I pray that you would give them encouragement. I pray that you would give them healing, deliverance, whatever it is they need for this journey, Lord. Lord, may they run this race, Lord, as the the song says, with reckless abandon, Lord, to never Lord, never give up, never quit. Touch each heart here, Lord. Touch each life, Lord. May one thing be said that would help somebody, Lord. I know it went all over the place, Lord Jesus, but I pray you would put them pieces together for someone. We thank you for it in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Brother Harry, if you can sing something for us, you know, as as I was studying this, I was in the library. Came over to church last night. I was in the library and I got to thinking about I don't mean to hold you standing. I got to thinking about when coach college coaches start looking for for athletes. They they they look for athletes that can uh help their universities out. They somebody they would want to represent their team. And one of the first questions they ask a high school coach when they come to to talk to the about a certain athlete is are they coachable? Are they coachable? Because you you notice sometimes the best the best athletes sometimes ain't the ones college takes. &gt;&gt; Because the high school coach says he thinks he knows everything. &gt;&gt; You can't teach him anything. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; She knows how to do it and she won't take nobody's &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; advice for nothing. God wants runners that are coachable. &gt;&gt; Runners that that he could look at and and Brother Donnie gets up here, Brother John, Brother Pete, Brother Joel, whoever it is, Brother Daryl, come up here. And they start preaching the word and they think, I need I need to do that. &gt;&gt; I need to change what I'm doing and do that. Th this this this is the training program. &gt;&gt; If you haven't noticed, it's a training program. &gt;&gt; Amen. and you come in here on Sunday in Wizzy and you get to pick up training on how to run. &gt;&gt; If you ain't coachable, you'll never do it. &gt;&gt; God's looking for some that'll forsake everything they've got. What we when I said when we first come out, you got things in your life that you're desperate that you chase after. Are you willing to forsake that? Are you willing to drop everything that means the most to you in life to pursue what God has for you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go ahead, Brother Harry. Let's worship him this morning.
