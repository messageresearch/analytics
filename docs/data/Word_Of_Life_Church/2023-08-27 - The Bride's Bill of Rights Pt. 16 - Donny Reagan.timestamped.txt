[44:18] okay
[44:21] amen we're so happy to be together today
[44:25] Lord willing September the 23rd and the
[44:29] 24th brother Tim Burdette and his church
[44:33] is going to come over and be with us
[44:35] you see this is one thing we could not
[44:36] do over at our other church for years
[44:39] and years and years so now we can do it
[44:42] and we're going to enjoy it
[44:46] okay
[44:51] so you're welcome of course to come and
[44:53] be with us if you'd like to September
[44:55] 23rd and 24th which is Saturday night
[44:57] and Sunday morning we'll just come
[45:00] expecting the Lord to
[45:01] speak to us and deal with us and I told
[45:03] them maybe Saturday night they can sing
[45:05] a lot and I tell them maybe he could
[45:06] preach but we're still kind of in that
[45:08] stage he don't want to and I want him to
[45:10] and he wants me to and I don't want to
[45:12] so we're still in the want to and not
[45:13] want to so I guess we'll see who wins
[45:16] out
[45:17] God bless you let's turn to First Peter
[45:19] today if you would chapter 4 verse 12.
[45:22] I'm gonna tell you right now I'm sure
[45:23] you already know it but there are no
[45:25] people like the people of God
[45:28] there are no people on the Earth but the
[45:31] people of God
[45:32] what a privilege it is to be able to rub
[45:34] shoulders with the people of God
[45:38] amen First Peter chapter 4 verse 12.
[45:42] as we just heard that awesome song won't
[45:45] it be a time whenever we get there
[45:47] but we all know
[45:49] there's a lot of hard things to go
[45:50] through before we get there
[45:53] our brother Joel maybe some of you don't
[45:55] know I had another stroke just not too
[45:57] many days ago and just got out of out of
[46:00] rehab this this week
[46:01] and I just want to remember our brother
[46:04] that the Lord will be with him and
[46:05] continue to strengthen him and bring him
[46:08] back for a complete restoration
[46:11] that's what our God does I mean
[46:18] last Sunday morning whenever we had the
[46:20] service and the end of service I was
[46:21] praying for people and just my
[46:24] inspiration spoke and said God could
[46:26] move for diabetes
[46:28] Brother Brad Gilbert was sitting there
[46:30] been dealing with diabetes for several
[46:32] years
[46:33] a blurred vision not been able to see
[46:36] and whenever those words were spoken the
[46:39] Holy Ghost just come over him like a
[46:41] warm feeling he said and the blurred
[46:44] vision left him
[46:46] that's our God
[46:50] Hallelujah
[46:52] today might be your day
[46:55] today might be my daughter Erica today
[46:58] show us how quick the angel of the Lord
[47:00] can come through huh
[47:02] amen I got a call from a young man from
[47:05] his uncle first and then from him and I
[47:08] talked together and the Lord was so
[47:09] dealing with his heart brother Reid
[47:11] balls he here today I think somebody
[47:12] told me that he was here where's he at
[47:15] raise your hand there buddy praise the
[47:16] Lord
[47:18] amen
[47:24] he said he'd been praying talking to the
[47:26] Lord and the Lord had been dealing said
[47:27] I want to be baptized I said well how
[47:29] soon is it as soon as I can so I'll
[47:31] check and see if there's water in the
[47:32] Baptist stream there wasn't no water so
[47:34] I said well we'll go to a creek a lake
[47:36] Pond what do we have to do brother Dave
[47:39] Swanson Missouri at the house with my
[47:40] golf a phone he said you've got a
[47:42] swimming pool over the hill
[47:45] I said oh how come I didn't think of
[47:46] that
[47:47] so I called him back
[47:50] I've cleaned up that swimming pool a lot
[47:51] of times my grandkids I blowed the dust
[47:54] and picked up the leaves and this and
[47:56] that but brother Ken ball told me
[47:57] probably that swimming pool was made for
[47:59] this very purpose right here
[48:02] so we took him down there and baptized
[48:04] him in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[48:07] Hallelujah
[48:09] praise the Lord
[48:13] I say when the water's troubled get in
[48:18] God bless you let's read together
[48:21] beloved think it not strange concerning
[48:24] the fiery trial
[48:27] the word fiery of burning the burning by
[48:30] which metals are roasted and reduced
[48:34] by figure drawn from a Refiner's Fire
[48:37] calamities or trials
[48:41] that test the character
[48:43] beloved thinketh not strains concerning
[48:45] the fiery trial which is to try you as
[48:47] though some strange thing happened unto
[48:51] you
[48:51] but rejoice
[48:53] I don't know about you I still need help
[48:56] with that part anybody else need help to
[48:59] be able to rejoice when you're right in
[49:00] the middle of the fire
[49:01] rejoice in as much as ye are partakers
[49:05] of Christ's sufferings and this is why
[49:09] that when his glory shall be revealed
[49:13] you may be glad also with exceeding Joy
[49:18] but if you be reproached for the name of
[49:20] Christ happy or you for the spirit of
[49:22] glory and of God resteth upon you on
[49:27] their part he is evil spoken of
[49:30] but on your part
[49:32] he is glorified
[49:34] and I'd like to be remembered today as
[49:36] we pray have a prayer request in your
[49:38] heart all right let's just go to the
[49:39] Lord
[49:41] Heavenly Father
[49:42] your children as we're gathered here
[49:44] today
[49:46] lord it's such an awesome time
[49:49] here we are in the darkest age the world
[49:51] has ever known our world is groping an
[49:54] insanity our nation is gone politics is
[49:57] gone Lord God we're so grateful that we
[50:00] have a stable place that we can be
[50:02] anchored that's in Christ Jesus
[50:05] we're so thankful today that we've been
[50:07] given this opportunity Lord we're so
[50:10] blessed brother Jewel the church would
[50:12] come to be with us today and the other
[50:13] visitors that are with us now father we
[50:16] come to the breaking of the bread and
[50:18] we're asking that you would come and
[50:20] take the bread and break it may we be
[50:23] when the service is over like those on
[50:26] the way to Emmaus that whenever they had
[50:28] set with you at the table and you broke
[50:31] the bread and then you vanished out of
[50:34] their sight and they knew it was you by
[50:37] the way you broke the bread
[50:39] so may we also know when this service is
[50:42] over that it wasn't a preacher it wasn't
[50:45] a singer it wasn't a musician
[50:47] but once again the Lord Jesus come Among
[50:50] Us and broke the bread in a way that we
[50:54] needed it father you see this prayer
[50:56] calls on my hand today Lord
[50:58] I'm asking your father for this young
[51:00] man that has hurt his shoulder in the
[51:02] name of Jesus May the spirit of God move
[51:05] for him bring complete deliverance Lord
[51:08] I know being the pastor here today
[51:09] there's many sick father viruses bugs
[51:12] all kinds of things that are going
[51:14] around but I pray in the name of Jesus
[51:17] May the sick be healed May those that
[51:19] are bound be delivered may we leave this
[51:21] place today free in Christ Jesus for
[51:25] it's in his name we ask it
[51:27] and the church said amen God bless you
[51:30] you may be seated
[51:39] I've been serving the lord for most of
[51:42] my life as many of you know Carol and I
[51:44] just turned 67 a few weeks back
[51:47] I've been serving him since I was 12.
[51:50] been preaching since I was 18.
[51:53] I preached to many foreign Nations and
[51:55] different tongues have to have
[51:57] interpreters to help you and all that
[52:01] sort of thing different continents of
[52:02] the world that the Lord has helped me to
[52:04] be able to go into
[52:06] but the more I find out about God the
[52:09] more I realize
[52:11] I had a little I do understand and know
[52:13] about him
[52:14] because his ways are so different than
[52:18] our ways
[52:19] how he loves to let his people get in a
[52:23] very difficult spot
[52:25] so that he can come on the scene and be
[52:28] able to move for them we don't always
[52:31] understand how that God will
[52:34] choose to display his greatness
[52:37] sometimes it's open in a Red Sea
[52:40] sometimes it's causing gigantic walls to
[52:44] fall down flat other times he would take
[52:48] hornets and send them Hornets before the
[52:51] armies of God and they would destroy the
[52:54] enemy another time he decided to send
[52:57] Angels down with adjustable wrenches or
[53:00] sockets whichever they used
[53:03] and caused all the chariot wheels to
[53:06] come off of some chariots and they found
[53:07] themselves on the bottom of the sea with
[53:10] no wheels on the Chariots now that's a
[53:12] bad place to find yourself in
[53:14] but the only way he could get Glory out
[53:17] of that situation was that his children
[53:19] had to be on that Red Sea for him to
[53:22] deliver them
[53:24] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego he chose
[53:26] to prove that he had power over the fire
[53:30] but in order to do that he had to let
[53:32] some kids of his be thrown into that
[53:35] furnace that had been heated seven times
[53:37] hotter than it ever had been hit before
[53:40] and God's way of doing that we can find
[53:42] it all through the Old Testament and the
[53:44] new and I'm sure that many of you here
[53:46] today are witnesses that he's done the
[53:48] same thing in your life how many is a
[53:50] witness of that that God will let you
[53:52] get in such a difficult spot and you're
[53:55] wondering Lord what am I doing in this
[53:58] place do you really love me do you
[54:01] really care why am I here which is of
[54:04] course why Peter felt to write this and
[54:07] to phrase it this way beloved think it
[54:09] not a strange thing when you find
[54:12] yourself in such a dilemma that you
[54:15] don't know what to do and you say what
[54:16] am I doing here as a child of God now we
[54:19] tend to think well you know it's only
[54:20] the Sinners it's the unrighteous it's
[54:23] the people that don't love the Lord and
[54:25] serving that find themselves in such
[54:28] calamities but that's not the truth the
[54:30] people of God find themselves in
[54:32] calamities the people of God find
[54:35] themselves many times in such a straight
[54:37] that they actually don't know what to do
[54:40] do and they don't know which way to go
[54:42] and it seems as if though if they look
[54:44] here there's the Red Sea now you know
[54:47] whenever you and I think about God being
[54:50] a mighty General and how that God would
[54:52] lead his people down to the Red Sea and
[54:55] God could have chosen any direction to
[54:58] send them but yet he knew that there was
[55:00] this narrow passage I saw a video of it
[55:03] not long ago on YouTube and they think
[55:05] they found the original place where they
[55:07] come down through there and when you
[55:09] look at it you can see that it's a
[55:11] perfect trap because there's mountains
[55:14] on this side mountains on that side that
[55:17] you cannot Compass there's only a an
[55:19] opening kind of in between those a pass
[55:22] that they could be able to go through
[55:24] before them is the sea behind them is
[55:27] Pharaoh's Army and it looked like that
[55:30] God made a terrible decision that God
[55:33] being this mighty mighty Captain would
[55:37] lead his people in such a position but
[55:39] God had to get them there for it first
[55:42] before he could prove what a deliverer
[55:45] that he was they looked behind them
[55:47] there was Pharaoh's Army they look here
[55:49] there's mountains straight up like this
[55:51] they look to the right Mountain straight
[55:53] up like this in front of them was the
[55:55] Red Sea what's God going to do roll back
[55:58] the Red Sea and let them walk through on
[56:00] dry ground maybe you're sitting here
[56:03] today and your life seems as if though
[56:05] there's mountains all around you and
[56:07] there's no way to go maybe you're so
[56:09] Bound by habits and things of the world
[56:11] and you've tried all sorts of things
[56:14] maybe you've tried to break this habit
[56:16] or that habit and you've tried your best
[56:18] and God knows that you have tried your
[56:21] best and you've Fallen flat on your face
[56:23] and it seems as if though there's no way
[56:26] out but let me sound a trumpet to you
[56:30] today our God is right your present this
[56:33] morning and he's here to move for you
[56:37] now we've not gathered here today that
[56:39] we can see what each one of us wore
[56:41] that's all right but let's move beyond
[56:44] that it's not Easter so nobody has on an
[56:46] Easter bonnet we don't pass out Rabbits
[56:49] and Eggs and all that sort of thing here
[56:51] but we're not here together to look at
[56:53] one another we're not here to try to
[56:55] impress one another I don't know about
[56:57] you I have needs today in the presence
[57:00] of God I'm walking at a place I've never
[57:03] been before if you come to play church
[57:06] today you might as well leave now
[57:08] because you're at the wrong house we've
[57:10] come today because there's folks that
[57:12] need to be healed there's folks that
[57:15] need to be delivered there's folks that
[57:17] need the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[57:19] there's folks that need to be Sanctified
[57:21] by the power of God there's holy ghosts
[57:24] filled people that need a refilling of
[57:27] what they've already got baby there's
[57:30] some here today that needs an
[57:31] old-fashioned stirring of the real
[57:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost anybody going
[57:36] to preach with me today I believe that
[57:39] even though the pressure is against the
[57:41] people of God and the hour is dark we
[57:44] are living in the Most Blessed age that
[57:48] any people could ever live in our God is
[57:51] moving in a mighty way come on somebody
[57:53] and say Amen he's Healing The Sick we've
[57:57] seen him just a few weeks ago raise the
[58:00] dead right back there amen that's the
[58:04] God I'm talking about we're not serving
[58:07] the Creed we're not serving an idol
[58:09] we're not serving a man-made imagination
[58:12] of someone but we are serving him who
[58:16] said I am the same yesterday today and
[58:19] forever I am Alpha I am obika I am the
[58:24] beginning come on Church let's have
[58:26] church today he was Abraham's Mighty God
[58:29] he was Joshua's wall Defender he was
[58:34] Jeremiah's help in the time of trouble
[58:36] he was a he kills wheel in the middle of
[58:39] the wheel he was John the Baptist's
[58:42] answer to prophecy he was habakkuk's
[58:45] desire to the nation he was or
[58:48] Hallelujah he was the mighty one that
[58:51] appeared Oh Glory to God when Abraham
[58:54] did not know which way to go when Moses
[58:58] was on the back side of the desert and
[59:00] he needed an answer he was the I am that
[59:04] I am that appeared in the burning bush
[59:07] well let me tell you today he's not only
[59:10] a god of history but he was my god when
[59:13] I needed a savior he was my god when I
[59:16] needed a greater understanding of the
[59:19] godhead he was my God whenever I was so
[59:22] low come on children has he been your
[59:25] God to heal you I said then your God to
[59:28] save you has he been your God not only
[59:31] that he's fixing to be our God which is
[59:35] going to take us out of this world in
[59:42] [Applause]
[59:46] the same one that saved me the same one
[59:50] that healed me is fixing to be the same
[59:52] one that's going to change us
[59:58] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:00:07] him those crucial hours
[1:00:11] that's when he loves to prove himself
[1:00:15] Prophet said it this way and those
[1:00:17] crucial crucifying hours listen to those
[1:00:20] words crucial
[1:00:23] crucifying hours
[1:00:25] oh my
[1:00:27] God that we see the resurrection
[1:00:30] it's in that time that when God loves
[1:00:34] to display
[1:00:36] his grace
[1:00:39] I mean he loves to see him do it
[1:00:42] but how many wants to help him do it
[1:00:45] ah now what happened dogs y'all hands it
[1:00:48] quit working
[1:00:50] and they're wonderful but when you're
[1:00:52] God restores a person God heals and God
[1:00:55] delivers and God brings them out of a
[1:00:57] fiery furnace
[1:00:59] but the problem of it is none of us want
[1:01:00] to be that person goes in the furnace
[1:01:03] no brother Isaiah do it let brother let
[1:01:07] somebody else in I'll Rejoice with them
[1:01:09] no sometimes God a trial and he's got
[1:01:12] your name wrote All Over
[1:01:13] [Applause]
[1:01:16] imagine our sister several years ago
[1:01:18] whenever the doctor gave her a diagnosis
[1:01:20] of cancer it was not the report she
[1:01:23] wanted to hear little did she know right
[1:01:26] says little did she know that God was
[1:01:28] going to use her she found favor in his
[1:01:31] sight you see God cannot trust everybody
[1:01:34] that way God cannot let terrible things
[1:01:37] happen to some children because they're
[1:01:38] babies they ain't growed up but I
[1:01:41] believe God's got some people that are
[1:01:43] mature Christians and he will let all
[1:01:46] hell come against them because he's got
[1:01:48] confidence in them he has been
[1:01:51] fellowshipping with them and he knows
[1:01:53] they believe in when things are good
[1:01:55] they believe in when things are bad they
[1:01:58] trust him when they got money in the
[1:02:00] bank they trust him and they ain't even
[1:02:01] got no bank they trust him whenever
[1:02:03] things are really good weather and they
[1:02:06] trust him when the wind is blowing when
[1:02:08] the wind is howling and they don't know
[1:02:10] what to do but God tells the devil I've
[1:02:12] got a daughter down there in Louisiana
[1:02:14] I've got
[1:02:17] who's going to tell her that is pretty
[1:02:19] bad it's cancer it's just a night and
[1:02:21] the other and they ain't much hope but
[1:02:23] what did our god do he come Hallelujah
[1:02:27] is a mighty rushing powerful God and
[1:02:30] brought complete deliverance to our
[1:02:32] sister here she sets among us today
[1:02:34] healed by the power of God I say for
[1:02:37] y'all to praise the Lord for doing such
[1:02:40] hallelujah amen I can't wait till I can
[1:02:44] stand here and give a testimony to my
[1:02:47] own daughter when the doctor say there's
[1:02:49] not much more they can do they want to
[1:02:52] Nashville this week and the doctor
[1:02:54] didn't have a good report but I'm glad
[1:02:57] I'm not looking to what the doctor says
[1:02:59] I'm not look into what a scan says I'm
[1:03:02] not looking to an MRI or a pet scan I'm
[1:03:06] looking to Jehovah God and his word and
[1:03:10] he said I am the Lord that healeth thee
[1:03:13] of all thy diseases
[1:03:16] [Applause]
[1:03:24] look at the difference one of many
[1:03:27] between me and God
[1:03:29] I would never let my daughter have
[1:03:31] cancer
[1:03:35] I would never let my daughter have
[1:03:36] cancer in her liver
[1:03:38] then I would never let it pass to her
[1:03:40] brain
[1:03:42] never
[1:03:44] but that shows what I know
[1:03:47] there's going to be somebody that's
[1:03:49] going to testify that God can save
[1:03:52] somebody that's lost that God can redeem
[1:03:55] somebody that sings past Redemption that
[1:03:58] God can heal somebody of brain cancer
[1:04:00] that God can heal somebody of liver
[1:04:03] cancer that God can restore somebody
[1:04:05] that's had a terrible stroke and the
[1:04:07] doctor says well that's the best you can
[1:04:09] have well that might be the best they
[1:04:11] say you can have but we believe there's
[1:04:14] another report and what is
[1:04:17] Hallelujah I hear strikes you I already
[1:04:22] healed mother sure in the name of Jesus
[1:04:25] that's what we choose to believe
[1:04:27] [Applause]
[1:04:35] notice this in those crucial hours
[1:04:39] that process
[1:04:42] to those sacred Sands
[1:04:48] sacred Sands
[1:04:51] what a what a powerful word two words
[1:04:54] together
[1:04:55] sacred
[1:04:57] Sands
[1:04:59] and what gives us there we don't shout
[1:05:01] our way over we shout away out
[1:05:03] but they don't shout our way here
[1:05:06] we call we're thrown inward you know
[1:05:09] however he can get us there in those
[1:05:12] crucial hours that press us on those
[1:05:14] sacred Sands it was in the Bible

[1:05:17] distress is Satan

[1:05:51] God is done with you
[1:05:54] somebody to say Amen how many knows that
[1:05:57] our life is brought here as brother
[1:05:59] Benton just said we were born to serve
[1:06:02] God I was born to torn in hell I was
[1:06:06] born to make nervous Devils nervous I
[1:06:09] was born to cast out Devils I was born
[1:06:13] to baptize I was born to preach I was
[1:06:16] born to lay hands on people I watched
[1:06:19] the Lord God straighten out their
[1:06:21] crossed eyes
[1:06:26] this I was born for this I will do
[1:06:32] this you were born for to serve almighty
[1:06:35] God and this we will do
[1:06:39] [Applause]
[1:06:43] Satan cannot take your life
[1:06:47] until God has finished with you listen
[1:06:51] this
[1:06:52] there is nothing
[1:06:56] can happen to you
[1:06:58] unless God permits it
[1:07:02] there is no evil
[1:07:06] that can come
[1:07:08] unless God permits it
[1:07:12] and it's for
[1:07:14] your good
[1:07:18] it's some of those good things I don't
[1:07:20] really enjoy you know what I mean
[1:07:23] it's for your good
[1:07:26] he's working that
[1:07:28] so you mean even when bad things and
[1:07:31] evil things will come upon us or come
[1:07:33] upon our family or upon our church or
[1:07:35] whatever more that God permitted that
[1:07:38] yes now God never done it
[1:07:41] but he allowed it
[1:07:43] when the enemy will say I'll do this and
[1:07:45] that and God said you won't do it
[1:07:48] you won't do it well let me add him go
[1:07:51] ahead but before you do it I'll tell you
[1:07:52] right now that's my daughter that's my
[1:07:55] son they believe me
[1:07:58] they will trust me take everything job
[1:08:02] had go ahead Smite him Smite his
[1:08:04] children let his wife turn against him
[1:08:06] but God had been fellowshipping with job
[1:08:09] and God testified to the devil and said
[1:08:11] I've got a man down there there ain't
[1:08:13] Nobody Like Him in all the earth and the
[1:08:16] devil said why sure you pet him and you
[1:08:19] baby him around God said no you go ahead
[1:08:21] and touch his life but you cannot be
[1:08:24] able to do this and that and God put
[1:08:26] boundaries on him so has he done for you
[1:08:28] and I he might try you he might test you
[1:08:31] but don't you worry he's like a dog on a
[1:08:34] chain he might jump and lunge at you and
[1:08:37] slobber at the mouth but he's got to end
[1:08:39] to that chain
[1:08:42] that's what I'm waiting for it's the end
[1:08:45] of the chain and the devil jumps and
[1:08:48] jerks so hard he chokes himself to death
[1:08:52] [Applause]
[1:08:55] amen this is our right
[1:08:59] as the pride of Christ
[1:09:01] to rule and reign with Jesus
[1:09:05] but we must have a character
[1:09:08] that will match his
[1:09:12] sad part about it is we wasn't born with
[1:09:15] that
[1:09:16] I'm gonna go ahead and describe you
[1:09:17] every one of your born Hogs
[1:09:20] lost blind wretched to suck me
[1:09:24] even that you got saved you still didn't
[1:09:26] have a good character
[1:09:30] but God wants a people with character
[1:09:32] that's going to be molded
[1:09:35] listen to this before Abraham could see
[1:09:38] Elohim
[1:09:40] there had to be 25 years
[1:09:44] of testing
[1:09:46] before the Hebrew children could see the
[1:09:49] Son of God they had to go into a fiery
[1:09:52] furnace I want you to notice now how the
[1:09:54] Cadence of this runs before the great
[1:09:57] supernatural phenomena happens something
[1:10:00] devastating will happen first before a
[1:10:04] great great miraculous Supernatural
[1:10:06] power of God can come I'm not looking
[1:10:09] for sickness I don't think any of you
[1:10:10] are but before healing can ever be made
[1:10:13] manifest somebody's gonna have to fight
[1:10:15] sickness before that can ever be
[1:10:18] diseases that are healed come on
[1:10:20] somebody people of God are going to have
[1:10:22] to wrestle them but we will only wrestle
[1:10:24] them for a season you'll imagine the
[1:10:27] blind man in John chapter 9 whenever the
[1:10:30] disciples come to Jesus and said who sin
[1:10:33] this man or his parents and Jesus said
[1:10:35] neither but the glory of God might be
[1:10:38] made manifest wonder how many Summers
[1:10:41] that oh God missed with his family I
[1:10:43] wonder how ashamed he was sitting there
[1:10:45] begging I wonder how much reproach was
[1:10:47] brought upon him he didn't even realize
[1:10:50] until that very day it was all for the
[1:10:53] glory of God some of you no doubt have
[1:10:56] suffered you went through such difficult
[1:10:58] in your life and you're thinking God
[1:11:00] don't you like me God have I done
[1:11:02] something that you don't love me the way
[1:11:05] you love others he's got to have
[1:11:06] somebody that he can try he's got to
[1:11:09] have somebody that he can test he's got
[1:11:12] to have somebody that he can face hell
[1:11:15] and he will stand there beside them and
[1:11:17] say Satan back off back off that's my
[1:11:21] son that's my daughter you can't go any
[1:11:24] farther stop here
[1:11:31] Gloria
[1:11:34] before Daniel could see an angel he had
[1:11:38] to go into the lines then
[1:11:40] before job could ever see the
[1:11:42] resurrection he had to go in and lose
[1:11:45] everything he had but then by vision
[1:11:49] notice let us get off the ash heat today
[1:11:53] with a new vision with a new power with
[1:11:57] a new determination that we see God in
[1:12:01] his power we see the resurrection of
[1:12:05] things coming how many wants to leave
[1:12:06] this ice sheep I'll tell you sometimes I
[1:12:09] get tired of piled up on the ass sheep
[1:12:11] don't you it's all hot and dry my
[1:12:13] there's dust everywhere in memories of
[1:12:15] this and memories of that I think we
[1:12:18] need to rise some of us and Shake
[1:12:19] ourselves off and say I'm sick and tired
[1:12:22] of this is he now he'll Stripes I'm
[1:12:24] Healed I've been waiting on God waiting
[1:12:26] on God waiting on God I'm going to rise
[1:12:29] up and I'm going to act like I'm already
[1:12:31] healed I'm going to go ahead and say by
[1:12:33] his type I'm already delivered I'm
[1:12:36] already free and the Devil is a loser
[1:12:38] and I am a winner
[1:12:40] [Applause]
[1:12:44] hello
[1:12:46] oh God help us
[1:12:48] it taken a Gethsemane
[1:12:51] of drops of blood breaking through his
[1:12:54] skin
[1:12:55] it taken a cruel Agony of Calvary before
[1:12:59] there could come the proof of an eternal
[1:13:01] God who could raise the Dead
[1:13:04] it taken a Gethsemane and a Calvary
[1:13:09] to make an Easter
[1:13:11] would we ever make that equation
[1:13:14] would we ever put them two things
[1:13:16] together
[1:13:18] to produce an Easter
[1:13:22] a Gethsemane look at this a Gethsemane
[1:13:25] and a Calvary so one Gethsemane on one
[1:13:30] Calvary one plus one equals
[1:13:34] a resurrection
[1:13:37] well they won't teach you that Maps will
[1:13:39] they won't teach you that in church
[1:13:41] theology but this is God's mathematics
[1:13:45] so one Gethsemane and one Calvary and
[1:13:48] the devil saw one Gethsemane one Calvary
[1:13:51] it means total extermination this is the
[1:13:54] only way they can be saved there's no
[1:13:56] way if I can kill him he's totally wiped
[1:13:59] out oh but I'd love to been down there
[1:14:02] close to the regions of the lost that
[1:14:04] day whenever they saw him as he died
[1:14:07] there on the cross my God my God wives
[1:14:10] all forsaken me and the devil must have
[1:14:12] no doubted hell kicked back in his
[1:14:15] recliner and all the Devils come back
[1:14:17] down and said oh devil we got him now
[1:14:19] he's the only one that we ever saw walk
[1:14:22] on water he's the only one that we ever
[1:14:24] saw do them Miracles and now we have
[1:14:27] killed him the kingdom and yours forever
[1:14:34] thank you
[1:14:38] so on the door keeping demons went to
[1:14:41] the door
[1:14:46] yes
[1:14:47] is Satan home
[1:14:52] he is
[1:14:54] who may I say is calling
[1:14:57] the first and the last the alpha the
[1:15:01] Omega let me get all glory to God the
[1:15:04] beginning at the end Hallelujah tell
[1:15:08] your boss he's got a guest
[1:15:12] hmm
[1:15:16] you imagine he walks up and said ah
[1:15:19] you arrived did you yes my blood is
[1:15:23] still hot on Calvary I thought I got you
[1:15:26] when I killed Moses I thought I got you
[1:15:28] when I got the firstborn down in Egypt
[1:15:30] and he goes on and on and on he said but
[1:15:32] you never but now I'm here well now I've
[1:15:35] killed you now I've taken your power and
[1:15:38] Jesus reaches over and grabs the keys
[1:15:41] off of his side and he turns around and
[1:15:44] keeps the door of hell and the prophet
[1:15:47] said he kicked it so hard he shook
[1:15:49] everything in hell off the walls
[1:15:59] and as you know the Devil in him got the
[1:16:02] keys to his own house
[1:16:04] [Applause]
[1:16:07] now right next door to Hell later region
[1:16:11] called Paradise
[1:16:14] so it goes over there
[1:16:19] maybe Abraham comes at the door
[1:16:26] oh my God
[1:16:28] Sarah
[1:16:33] it's the same one that come down to our
[1:16:35] tenth that day you remember that one
[1:16:37] that told you what you were seeking it's
[1:16:39] him and Ezekiel said who is it who is it
[1:16:43] he's trying to jump over the people who
[1:16:44] is it oh no oh no it's that man I saw in
[1:16:48] the middle of the wheel that wheel in
[1:16:50] the middle of the wheel what did he do
[1:16:51] he come down to set them free I believe
[1:16:54] he's right here this morning in Word of
[1:16:56] Life Church to set you free from last
[1:16:59] from line from adultery whatever it is
[1:17:02] that's got you bound
[1:17:08] one Gethsemane
[1:17:10] one Calvary
[1:17:12] equaled Abraham's
[1:17:14] freedom
[1:17:19] Hallelujah
[1:17:21] he was beaten
[1:17:23] so you could be healed
[1:17:25] why would you let the devil rob you
[1:17:29] he was beaten so you could put that
[1:17:32] alcohol them drugs that adultery under
[1:17:36] your feet forever you'll never do it by
[1:17:39] drawing out of church you'll never do it
[1:17:41] by shaking hands with a preacher but
[1:17:43] you've got to meet the resurrection
[1:17:45] himself and the Resurrection comes
[1:17:48] inside of you oh glory and then you have
[1:17:51] one Gethsemane and one Calvary and that
[1:17:54] will produce your Resurrection
[1:17:56] [Music]
[1:18:01] see it takes a crucifixion
[1:18:04] takes a crushing of the flower
[1:18:07] to bring perfume from it it takes a
[1:18:09] crushing of a life
[1:18:11] to get the best out of it that there is
[1:18:14] Lord help us
[1:18:16] that's the reason Jesus had to be
[1:18:18] crushed to bring forth what he was
[1:18:20] listen to his friend which is just
[1:18:22] really concentrate on this
[1:18:24] he could not stand before the
[1:18:26] crucifixion and say
[1:18:29] all power in heavens and earth
[1:18:32] is given unto me
[1:18:35] you don't find you're saying that before
[1:18:38] he died
[1:18:40] he could only say it
[1:18:46] oh blessed be the Lord God
[1:18:49] I mean if you have went through terrible
[1:18:51] trials and you go yeah praise the Lord I
[1:18:53] know brother so-and-so is delivered to
[1:18:54] this and delivered that but you couldn't
[1:18:56] really say it for yourself
[1:18:58] now look at my life brother Tim Pruitt
[1:19:00] there's a few others that I know of I
[1:19:02] never smoked I never drank I never done
[1:19:04] any of that never was out there in the
[1:19:06] world and done what many of you have by
[1:19:07] the grace of God it took just as much of
[1:19:09] the mercy of God the blood of Jesus the
[1:19:11] Same is it did you
[1:19:12] so what if everybody come at me brother
[1:19:14] tell them the same way letting out there
[1:19:16] in the world never drunk never cuss
[1:19:18] never lied never done any of those
[1:19:19] things that yet come to the lord of the
[1:19:21] very very early age and what if every
[1:19:24] one of the children of God let me gather
[1:19:25] around in heaven and every one of us
[1:19:27] will say well Lord we never drunk we
[1:19:29] never smoked we never got out there on
[1:19:31] the World to talk who was going to
[1:19:32] testify that God can reach down to the
[1:19:35] lowest tale somebody here today somebody
[1:19:38] here today some of you that's dreaming
[1:19:40] our service you'll be able to stand
[1:19:41] before the Lord Jesus and give a
[1:19:43] testimony that I cannot give come on
[1:19:46] somebody I know he can deliver
[1:19:47] alcoholics because I prayed for many of
[1:19:49] them I know he can deliver drug addicts
[1:19:52] because I prayed for many of them I know
[1:19:54] he can be able to do these things but I
[1:19:56] don't know it personally the way some of
[1:19:58] you know it but some of you could say
[1:20:00] glory to God I was an alcoholic I smoked
[1:20:03] cigarettes I done this so now to the
[1:20:05] other but today I am free I
[1:20:10] [Applause]
[1:20:12] it's free indeed it will be your
[1:20:16] testimony and yours and yours and yours
[1:20:18] mingled in was mine
[1:20:21] that will have every devil blanketed out
[1:20:23] there won't be one left
[1:20:26] that will not have been conquered
[1:20:30] [Music]
[1:20:35] [Applause]
[1:20:37] he could have spoke all of his
[1:20:39] attributes into existence
[1:20:41] before he ever made a world
[1:20:43] let there be let there be let there be
[1:20:46] let there be
[1:20:48] we would have gathered around his throne
[1:20:50] and we would have worshiped and adored
[1:20:53] oh great Adonai
[1:20:55] Jehovah
[1:20:57] Jehovah Elohim
[1:20:59] women of worship and praised and adored
[1:21:02] and he could have said I'm a redeemer
[1:21:05] but of course known if you were lost
[1:21:08] I'm a Healer but none of you were ever
[1:21:10] sick
[1:21:12] I'm a deliverer but none of you were
[1:21:14] ever bound
[1:21:16] and we would have taken his word for it
[1:21:20] but he didn't want it to be that way
[1:21:22] you imagine When We Gather those that
[1:21:25] have lived down through all the ages
[1:21:28] glory to God
[1:21:30] when we go to testify
[1:21:32] maybe a beginning with one of you
[1:21:34] brothers and sister back up Lord can I
[1:21:36] testify
[1:21:37] Papa
[1:21:39] I was lost
[1:21:40] and you saved me
[1:21:42] uh maybe that little woman at the well
[1:21:44] will jump up and jump him and say Jesus
[1:21:49] you remember meeting me
[1:21:52] I'm at Samaritan woman that's aware
[1:21:55] I do remember you daughter I did
[1:21:57] remember you yes yes yes you went in and
[1:21:59] set the city on fire because I set you
[1:22:01] on fire
[1:22:02] I do remember you you've been married
[1:22:04] all those times and you've done this or
[1:22:06] that she just like to stand up she'll
[1:22:08] imagine she's going to be one emotional
[1:22:10] sister in the paradise when you she's
[1:22:12] going to be one sister that we're gonna
[1:22:14] have a hard time setting down because
[1:22:16] she was a person that nobody would have
[1:22:18] nothing to do with everybody wrote her
[1:22:20] off all the church didn't want nothing
[1:22:22] to do whether but Jesus went out of his
[1:22:25] way to get a hold of this woman why
[1:22:27] because her name was on the Lamb's Book
[1:22:29] of Life and there was not enough devils
[1:22:32] in hell to keep in the Lord Jesus from
[1:22:35] going to her
[1:22:39] yeah
[1:22:40] Oh Glory to God
[1:22:44] after the crucifixion
[1:22:46] he could stand and say all powers
[1:22:50] in Heaven and Earth is given unto me but
[1:22:53] what did it do it taken crucifixion
[1:22:56] first
[1:22:58] it taken the question
[1:23:00] and the disappointing of the Apostles
[1:23:02] when they'd seen their savior the one
[1:23:04] they loved and seen him raised from the
[1:23:07] dead from the grave
[1:23:09] I watched the prophets he relates his
[1:23:10] own experience when I lost my baby my
[1:23:14] little Sharon and that was one thing
[1:23:16] that stumbled me
[1:23:19] I said how can that be for good
[1:23:22] maybe some of you said to you today and
[1:23:24] you've lost a child or a husband or a
[1:23:26] wife or a loved one and you say how can
[1:23:28] that be for my good
[1:23:30] my heart is broken I'll never be the
[1:23:33] same how can that be
[1:23:36] a few months later when I seen her
[1:23:37] standing in all the beauty of a young
[1:23:39] girl speaking to me China by the side of
[1:23:42] that Old Wagon broken down and I know if
[1:23:45] she would have lived she might have
[1:23:46] turned out wrong
[1:23:49] God had to take her while she was tender
[1:23:52] and sweet
[1:23:54] I know I'll see you again I know I shall
[1:23:57] see her and I Know It Beyond any shadow
[1:24:00] of a doubt I think of my wife of 22
[1:24:02] years old taking merely a girl a little
[1:24:04] mother when the paper's given the
[1:24:05] headline young mother of a reverend just
[1:24:07] died how my heart bled I didn't know
[1:24:10] what to do
[1:24:12] but today I know it was all working for
[1:24:15] my good
[1:24:16] I know the life had to be ground and
[1:24:19] twisted and squeezed
[1:24:21] to get what was in it out
[1:24:25] or am I glad God squeezed him
[1:24:28] well I'm not glad for the pain he had to
[1:24:30] go sir I'm not glad for the pain that
[1:24:33] Paul had to go through but am I glad
[1:24:35] brother Jolie was able to be squeezed
[1:24:37] out I would not have Romans first and
[1:24:39] second Corinthians Philippians Ephesians
[1:24:41] Galatians Philemon I would not have all
[1:24:44] of these books to read brother Harvey we
[1:24:46] would not have all this encouragement
[1:24:47] had God not had men of God that he could
[1:24:50] squeeze and pressure him all my but he
[1:24:53] had confidence in them you say how can
[1:24:55] you say that because he knew them before
[1:24:57] the foundation of the world as he told
[1:25:00] Jeremiah before you was ever formed in
[1:25:02] your mother's womb I ordained you a
[1:25:05] prophet to the Nations
[1:25:08] oh my God watch how he relates this to
[1:25:12] himself into us
[1:25:13] there was too much
[1:25:15] of you in you
[1:25:18] know what the paragraph about this there
[1:25:21] was too much Branham in there that had
[1:25:24] to be squeezed out before God could make
[1:25:27] himself known
[1:25:30] there was too much of you in you
[1:25:34] wow
[1:25:36] so you mean your wife is not your
[1:25:38] greatest enemy after all I mean it's not
[1:25:40] your brother it's not your husband it's
[1:25:42] not you you know your next door neighbor
[1:25:43] you mean your greatest enemy is actually
[1:25:45] you and you oh that's a hard one isn't
[1:25:48] it that's a hard thing to separate me
[1:25:50] out of me
[1:25:52] praise the Lord
[1:25:54] and notice the way he says that there's
[1:25:56] too much of you and you too God had to
[1:25:58] squeeze it out through blessings and oh
[1:26:02] my giving you over abundance of money
[1:26:04] and just making you so rich and making
[1:26:07] how we wish
[1:26:11] God had to squeeze it out through trials
[1:26:14] and while that squeezing was coming on
[1:26:16] it's
[1:26:20] but after a while the sky's clear back
[1:26:24] and you see the purpose of God then you
[1:26:28] cry
[1:26:29] notice then you cry
[1:26:34] I know my redeemer liveth and at the
[1:26:38] last days he'll stand on the earth and
[1:26:39] though the skin worm destroys this body
[1:26:42] yet in my flesh shall I see God these
[1:26:45] little trials and things are just for a
[1:26:47] moment and they fade and pass away
[1:26:49] they're only done for our good lest
[1:26:53] remember that that God would get Glory
[1:26:56] come with me to Romans chapter 8 verse
[1:26:58] 17. Paul introduces a very strange thing
[1:27:02] it has been called the hurts and the
[1:27:06] hallelujahs
[1:27:07] the hurts
[1:27:09] and the hallelujahs and if children then
[1:27:12] heirs Heirs of God John Heirs of Christ
[1:27:15] if so be that we
[1:27:20] suffer with him that we may also be
[1:27:24] glorified together
[1:27:26] notice Romans 8 17 introduces us to two
[1:27:31] important biblical ideas suffering and
[1:27:35] Glory suffering and Glory or the hurts
[1:27:39] and the hallelujahs this verse begins
[1:27:43] appropriately with the glory of course
[1:27:45] and if children then heirs oh my who
[1:27:49] wouldn't want to be told that if
[1:27:51] children then Heirs of God and John else
[1:27:54] with Jesus Christ boy don't God know how
[1:27:57] to be able to get our attention he'll go
[1:27:59] to babying us and Hallelujah honey I
[1:28:01] love you so much and you just my little
[1:28:03] young and you're my little boy and my
[1:28:05] little girl I died for you and I love
[1:28:07] you and then he let you have it
[1:28:10] if children then heirs Heirs of God John
[1:28:13] heirsth Christ
[1:28:16] if so be we suffer with it now notice
[1:28:19] what he done he put the Hallelujah first
[1:28:22] and then he put the hurt right in the
[1:28:24] middle of it and scrunched it together
[1:28:26] don't worry he hallelujahizes the rest
[1:28:28] of the end of the verse here because he
[1:28:29] knows we need it most of us need two
[1:28:32] hallelujahs for every one trial that we
[1:28:34] go through sometimes depends on the
[1:28:35] length of the trial when matinee 200
[1:28:37] hallelujahs but the Lord knows exactly
[1:28:40] what we need and the church said
[1:28:43] if children than Heirs of God in John
[1:28:45] heirs says Christ if so be that we
[1:28:46] suffer with him
[1:28:48] watching he just stays in there for just
[1:28:50] a little bit brother Levi just a little
[1:28:52] bit if we suffer with him now we go back
[1:28:55] to the Hallelujah that we may also be
[1:28:58] glorified the governor of saints say oh
[1:29:00] thank you Jesus thank you Jesus we say
[1:29:03] all Heirs of God amen Amen brother now
[1:29:07] you're talking my language Heirs of God
[1:29:08] and showing Heirs of God yes sir that's
[1:29:11] me
[1:29:14] until we come to that part if so be that
[1:29:17] we are heirs that we suffer
[1:29:23] Ed much so he said that
[1:29:26] if you're getting Revelation on this
[1:29:28] today it'll help you enjoy my sermon
[1:29:29] even better
[1:29:33] you see the first profound statement
[1:29:35] we're children of God and heirs wow
[1:29:38] heirs you know like John Paul Getty was
[1:29:41] your uncle or something
[1:29:43] you know the Amazon guy you found out
[1:29:45] that she was just relate to him and he's
[1:29:47] going to go ahead and give you part of
[1:29:48] his inheritance now one of the greatest
[1:29:50] richest men in all the world that's a
[1:29:52] lie I'm way richer than the Amazon Bezos
[1:29:55] guy
[1:29:57] my goodness I've got eternal life I've
[1:29:59] got peace I've got joy I've got
[1:30:00] happiness that man ain't got nothing but
[1:30:03] a bunch of kingdom and an animal is a
[1:30:04] Amazon Kingdom of that which ain't gonna
[1:30:06] last very much longer know how because
[1:30:08] the end of all things is at hand when
[1:30:10] there ain't no more Jeff Bezos I still
[1:30:12] will be when there is no more devil you
[1:30:15] still will be when there is no more
[1:30:17] sickness you still will be brother
[1:30:19] sister
[1:30:25] Verse 18 for I reckon
[1:30:30] that the sufferings of this present time
[1:30:33] are not worthy to be compared
[1:30:38] with the glory
[1:30:40] which shall be revealed in US you see
[1:30:44] the weight of the Saints cross
[1:30:47] is not even comparable
[1:30:49] to the glory they'll have
[1:30:53] what's that day
[1:30:57] it can seem so heavy now
[1:30:59] and so difficult
[1:31:01] you see even creation is groaning for
[1:31:04] the freedom from sin
[1:31:08] already we can look around in our
[1:31:10] beautiful hills and mountains here of
[1:31:12] Tennessee
[1:31:13] just this week I've noticed a sugar
[1:31:16] maple on a street in our subdivision
[1:31:20] just this week it has changed from such
[1:31:24] a beautiful green
[1:31:25] now a red is already coming for us
[1:31:28] before you know it but look around in
[1:31:30] the yellows and the oranges and the Reds
[1:31:33] and the trees
[1:31:34] then before you know it there won't be
[1:31:36] none
[1:31:36] we'll look across the mountain some and
[1:31:38] say what happened to it the glory is but
[1:31:42] a fading moment and it's gone we enjoy
[1:31:46] him for several months during the summer
[1:31:47] how beautiful they are and people come
[1:31:50] to Gatlinburg they come to Pigeon Forge
[1:31:52] they come from everywhere to see what
[1:31:54] the Turning of the color of the leaves
[1:31:56] that you and I know it's a sign of death
[1:32:00] it won't be too much longer there won't
[1:32:02] be no leaves left they'll be totally
[1:32:03] gone that's the seasons of our life we
[1:32:06] go through those times and everything is
[1:32:07] so green and so beautiful and then all
[1:32:09] of a sudden the leaf will turn or you
[1:32:11] imagine how brother Jewel felt the other
[1:32:13] day just on Sundays brother Isaiah was
[1:32:15] telling me and that out to the service
[1:32:17] and this stroke hit by the Jewel and
[1:32:19] they thought he was kind of sweet but he
[1:32:21] wasn't asleep such a Vanessa come up and
[1:32:23] there was a nurse there at the
[1:32:24] restaurant where they were thank God
[1:32:25] they were and then another one come up
[1:32:28] and they were able to rush him to the
[1:32:29] hospital and able to be able to move for
[1:32:32] our brother don't we thank God for that
[1:32:33] today do you think he wanted that to
[1:32:35] happen to him but I believe our God has
[1:32:38] a greater phase of Glory that he wants
[1:32:41] to reveal and how does he reveal it to
[1:32:43] the fading of the leaves through the
[1:32:45] tests and the trials
[1:32:47] of life
[1:32:49] second Timothy chapter 2 verse 12.
[1:32:52] if we suffer
[1:32:55] we shall also reign
[1:32:57] with him if we deny him
[1:33:00] he also will deny us
[1:33:03] oh children we don't want to deny him do
[1:33:05] it
[1:33:06] we will reign with him if we watch jump
[1:33:10] shout dance I believe in all that you'll
[1:33:13] never find one scripture identifying
[1:33:15] those who reign with Christ as being
[1:33:18] those who jump or shout or even speak
[1:33:20] with tongues
[1:33:21] and yet we believe in all of the above
[1:33:24] but the identification is always the
[1:33:26] same suffering persecution difficult
[1:33:30] submitting your life to God and say God
[1:33:33] here I am if God was handing out the
[1:33:37] gift of Miracles
[1:33:39] In The Word of Life church today
[1:33:42] how many would want it
[1:33:45] speaking in tongues signs wonders how
[1:33:48] many preachers would want it
[1:33:50] ain't none of you raising your hands
[1:33:52] because you ain't been honest
[1:33:53] but if God was handing out diverse kinds
[1:33:56] of tongues and miracles and all kinds of
[1:33:59] things how many of us would want it the
[1:34:00] majority of us would
[1:34:03] but if God said I need somebody
[1:34:06] but I can prove I'm a Healer of cancer
[1:34:10] God said I need somebody that I can
[1:34:13] prove I can stop a heart attack
[1:34:18] God can say I need somebody that I can
[1:34:21] straighten out cross eyes
[1:34:24] you wouldn't find me the first in line
[1:34:25] with that I like mine the way they are
[1:34:27] they ain't pretty but they're mine
[1:34:29] I wouldn't want I wouldn't volunteer for
[1:34:31] cancer I wouldn't volunteer none of my
[1:34:34] church folks I certainly wasn't
[1:34:35] volunteer none of my family
[1:34:38] so God knows better than to ask any of
[1:34:40] us such
[1:34:41] because most of us would say I'm going
[1:34:43] to the back of the line Lord I thought
[1:34:45] she meant Miracles I didn't realize you
[1:34:46] meant I was going to be the recipient of
[1:34:48] one I thought you meant I was going to
[1:34:49] be the one to do it
[1:34:54] so God looks down and says
[1:34:58] ah you
[1:35:00] what if I let you
[1:35:03] fight a battle
[1:35:05] diabetes
[1:35:07] are you strong enough
[1:35:09] and you're praying you cry and you're
[1:35:11] praying
[1:35:12] and you say but my God is going to
[1:35:15] deliver me
[1:35:17] and you go to meetings and other people
[1:35:18] get healed
[1:35:19] when you come back still on your insulin
[1:35:22] and the devil say yeah yeah uh-huh see
[1:35:24] there it ain't it ain't happening for
[1:35:25] you and you just might as well remind
[1:35:27] him all you gotta do sister say one word
[1:35:28] yet
[1:35:30] yet it ain't happened yet but it's going
[1:35:33] to
[1:35:34] I said it ain't happened yet but it's
[1:35:36] going to well praise the Lord maybe
[1:35:39] you're here today he said well I've been
[1:35:40] prayed for and I've been prayed for and
[1:35:42] it ain't come I had one more word it
[1:35:44] ain't come yet but I'm waiting for it I
[1:35:46] don't know when the angel of the Lord's
[1:35:48] coming to my neighborhood but I believe
[1:35:49] he's fixing to pass through
[1:35:52] Hallelujah I don't know when he's going
[1:35:54] to do it but I'm waiting on him Lord I'm
[1:35:56] on your hands
[1:35:57] [Applause]
[1:36:01] notice in Revelation chapter 5 verse 10
[1:36:03] and we'll close your shortly
[1:36:07] the voice of the Overcomers
[1:36:11] and has made us unto our God
[1:36:14] Kings and Priests
[1:36:17] and we shall reign
[1:36:19] on the Earth
[1:36:23] notice this in the church age book he
[1:36:25] redeemed us for a purpose he bought us
[1:36:27] for a purpose we are Kings
[1:36:30] spiritual Kings
[1:36:33] we're going listen we're going to be
[1:36:35] Kings upon the Earth with him when he
[1:36:37] sits on his throne but now
[1:36:40] We Are Spiritual Kings and we Reign Over
[1:36:44] a spiritual Kingdom
[1:36:49] praise the Lord
[1:36:52] I believe there's some Sons and
[1:36:54] Daughters of God sitting in this
[1:36:55] building today that are already enjoying
[1:36:58] reigning with the Lord Jesus
[1:37:04] why because sin which one time had you
[1:37:07] bound today is under your feet
[1:37:10] tempered that you thought Lord have
[1:37:12] mercy in my family every one of them may
[1:37:14] goth office him forever was but the
[1:37:16] grace of God come and now that temper is
[1:37:19] under your feet maybe a sexual passion
[1:37:22] and whatever more has just about
[1:37:24] discharge your entire family and you
[1:37:26] think Lord help me dear God it runs in
[1:37:28] my family I can see my uncles I can see
[1:37:31] my aunts I can see my grandma I can see
[1:37:33] my grandpa it you need to be identified
[1:37:36] with another family tree you need to be
[1:37:39] identified with the family tree of life
[1:37:41] and you need to say no devil you're not
[1:37:43] destroying me with lust you're not
[1:37:46] destroying me with lying I am a son or
[1:37:49] daughter of God I am already reigning
[1:37:52] with Jesus Christ in a spiritual Kingdom
[1:37:56] on this Earth you're under my feet
[1:38:01] oh Hallelujah
[1:38:04] Hallelujah
[1:38:05] notices we are already raining
[1:38:09] it says for by one man's death excuse me
[1:38:12] the deaths reigned by what much more
[1:38:15] they which receive abundance of grace
[1:38:16] and the gift of righteousness shall
[1:38:18] reign in life by why Christ Jesus oh
[1:38:22] think the spirit of God living in our
[1:38:27] souls helping us to overcome what we
[1:38:31] thought was impossible helping us to
[1:38:34] live the kind of life that the Lord
[1:38:36] Jesus is not ashamed
[1:38:38] to call you Brothers
[1:38:46] hmm
[1:38:54] all right sir
[1:38:56] Inspire it
[1:39:05] Revelation 20 and 6 blessed is Holy he
[1:39:08] that has part in the First Resurrection
[1:39:09] on such the second death hath no power
[1:39:13] but they shall be Priests of God and of
[1:39:15] Christ
[1:39:16] and shall reign with him
[1:39:19] Thousand Years
[1:39:21] Hallelujah
[1:39:25] every one of you today think nobody
[1:39:27] knows you like you
[1:39:30] you know your UPS or Downs your
[1:39:32] weaknesses
[1:39:33] your failings
[1:39:38] I believe the Lord Jesus desires
[1:39:41] to bring us to a place of victory
[1:39:43] well we can have a Victorious walk
[1:39:47] and it's not by our own life of course
[1:39:49] in our own power
[1:39:50] but it's his power
[1:39:52] that lives inside of us
[1:39:56] praise the Lord
[1:39:58] as a matter of fact brother Tim Pratt
[1:39:59] sent me a quote this morning
[1:40:01] it's just absolutely wonderful
[1:40:03] he said that a person can become so full
[1:40:05] of God's presence and living in the
[1:40:08] presence of God and you become drunk on
[1:40:10] the Holy Ghost
[1:40:12] you're drunk every day for the rest of
[1:40:13] your life
[1:40:15] the rest of your life you're so drunk on
[1:40:17] the presence of God I began to think
[1:40:19] about that and I thought you know Lord
[1:40:21] the truth of it is I guess everybody in
[1:40:23] this age is drunk on something
[1:40:25] it's easy to see a lot of folks are
[1:40:26] drunk on politics some are drunk on
[1:40:29] religion some are drunk on money some
[1:40:30] are drunk on this and Heather so if I'm
[1:40:32] gonna have to be drunk on something I
[1:40:34] choose the Holy Ghost as my brands what
[1:40:37] about you to be so intoxicated was the
[1:40:40] word that the prophet used so
[1:40:42] intoxicated you get up intoxicated you
[1:40:45] go to bed intoxicated you're so drunk oh
[1:40:48] and then I found another statement where
[1:40:49] it said in Shreveport that he said May
[1:40:51] the presence of the Holy Ghost come in
[1:40:53] this building today in such a way that
[1:40:56] will become so drunk on the holy ghost
[1:40:59] that we forget what our name is
[1:41:03] why now wouldn't that be a drunk Bunch
[1:41:05] we don't even know who we are we just so
[1:41:08] lose sight of the things that are around
[1:41:11] us
[1:41:12] oh praise the Lord
[1:41:15] praise the Lord
[1:41:18] thank you Father
[1:41:20] thank you Father

[1:41:34] need the baptism of the Holy Ghost many
[1:41:35] of you I believe with all of my heart
[1:41:36] you've got it already but maybe you feel
[1:41:38] like today you need a refilling a
[1:41:41] refreshing from the presence of the Lord
[1:41:43] well I tell you one thing I do I need a
[1:41:45] refilling today I need a refreshing in
[1:41:48] his presence oh no I ain't saying
