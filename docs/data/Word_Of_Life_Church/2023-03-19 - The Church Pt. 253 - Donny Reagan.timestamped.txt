[47:25] we're so grateful dear God for parents
[47:28] and desire to bring children into the
[47:30] Earth
[47:32] Lord they have a desire to not only give
[47:34] life
[47:36] but to be able to raise them in the way
[47:39] that when this life is over they can
[47:41] enter in with sin into eternity
[47:45] Heavenly Father we're asking today that
[47:48] you would just be with him Lord he said
[47:51] a lot of battles already in his life but
[47:54] Jesus we've seen you bring him through
[47:56] one after the other
[47:58] he can't even talk yet hardly can't even
[48:00] hardly do anything for himself
[48:03] but he's already experienced the power
[48:05] of God in his life
[48:08] we bring him to you today Father which
[48:11] is pray that you'd watch over him and
[48:13] keep him no matter what Satan would try
[48:15] to bring against him may your great hand
[48:17] be with him Lord
[48:18] give his father the wisdom the ability
[48:21] to instruct him and guide him his mother
[48:24] the fifth the gospel I pray that you
[48:26] would help her a father that she can be
[48:28] able to imprint upon him what a real
[48:31] godly woman is like we bring him to you
[48:34] today and we dedicated his life to you
[48:37] for a life of service in Jesus name amen
[48:43] that's where a lot of people look at me
[48:47] foreign
[48:49] [Applause]
[49:09] Carol has to come up and get a picture
[49:11] now
[49:14] look friends this is your one and only
[49:16] time you'll see the pastor's life up
[49:18] front
[49:25] Heavenly fathers are standing here today
[49:27] and
[49:30] in my heart I know
[49:32] Sharon would be so so happy to be able
[49:34] to
[49:35] see your little granddaughter here today
[49:38] dedicated
[49:40] to you Lord
[49:41] but you chosen your wisdom to take her
[49:44] on a poem
[49:46] check her to her rewards so
[49:49] praying today father that you would just
[49:52] help Joe and hope as they had this
[49:56] little daughter
[49:57] but pray that you'll just give them
[49:59] wisdom and strength
[50:04] know how father razor
[50:07] trainer and teacher
[50:10] Lord we're just praying that your
[50:12] presence would just be with her Lord
[50:14] being a little girl that's going to be a
[50:16] lot aimed at her I know that Satan loves
[50:19] to aim it at the women in this day
[50:22] so many Fashions so many things to try
[50:26] to affect them but we also know Lord
[50:28] that whenever it's all said and done the
[50:31] sisters will have a great reward
[50:33] because in many ways they've overcome
[50:35] much more than the men have
[50:38] so I pray that your keeper
[50:41] she would get old enough to be able to
[50:43] no rhyme from wrong
[50:45] deal with her heart while she's young
[50:47] and tender but she can give her heart to
[50:49] you give them wisdom and strength to be
[50:52] able to know how to raise her
[50:54] teacher and the admonition of God we
[50:57] dedicate her to you father today for a
[50:59] life of service in Jesus name
[51:04] [Applause]
[51:12] stand again
[51:19] love of Jesus today
[51:21] praise the Lord that's awesome
[51:23] let's turn if you would to the
[51:26] book of First Kings chapter 22.
[51:29] verse 5.
[51:32] First Kings chapter 22 verse 5 read a
[51:35] few verses there
[51:39] I want you to listen carefully now to
[51:41] our
[51:42] setting today
[51:44] and Jehoshaphat said unto the king of
[51:46] Israel
[51:48] inquire I pray thee
[51:50] at the word of the Lord today
[51:53] but this time in the scripture the
[51:55] kingdom had been divided into two sects
[52:00] to divisions in the land of Israel one
[52:04] of them was still called Israel and the
[52:06] other one was called Judah Jehoshaphat
[52:08] was the king of Judah and Ahab of course
[52:12] being the king of Israel
[52:13] so the syrians are approaching them and
[52:16] they're going to have a war
[52:18] Jehoshaphat has been asked by Ahab to
[52:22] come and join ranks with him
[52:25] Jehoshaphat was a real believer
[52:28] Ahab but something else that's for sure
[52:31] but Jehoshaphat still even though it
[52:34] entered into his compromising Union with
[52:37] this make-believing so-called message
[52:39] person
[52:40] he still had enough about him to know
[52:43] that the Lord's way was important and so
[52:45] he says Joshua sinner the king of Israel
[52:48] inquire I praise thee at the word of the
[52:52] Lord today I want you to notice how this
[52:54] is spelled capital L capital O capital r
[52:58] capital D
[53:00] verse 6. then the king of Israel
[53:03] gathered the prophets together about 400
[53:06] men wow
[53:09] 400 Hebrew
[53:12] prophets not heathens
[53:15] Hebrew Prophets
[53:17] and said unto them shall I go against
[53:19] Ramos Gilead to battle or shall I
[53:23] forebear and they said go up
[53:28] for the Lord but look at how this one's
[53:31] spelled capital L little o little r
[53:35] Little D
[53:36] now this is the Hebrew word
[53:39] which is also used for Baal
[53:42] Jehoshaphat was not interested in what
[53:45] Baal had to say he was interested in
[53:47] capital l or Rd which is Jehovah or
[53:51] Yahweh
[53:53] but now these guys watch what they're
[53:55] saying
[53:56] the Lord will be with you or the Lord
[53:59] will give it into your hand capital L
[54:02] small o smaller small d so it kind of
[54:05] makes you wonder where these guys are
[54:07] look at their message
[54:09] it is a message of compromise
[54:13] and they said go up
[54:17] for the Lord shall deliver it now the
[54:20] word it is not actually in the original
[54:22] watch these guys how deceiving they are
[54:28] for the Lord shall deliver leave it out
[54:32] unto the hand of the king
[54:35] but I want you to notice they don't say
[54:37] which king
[54:39] or what's actually going to be delivered
[54:43] so it's a more Universal prophecy
[54:47] that whoever wins this battle they're
[54:49] going to win either way because they
[54:52] asked you didn't say Ahab you were going
[54:55] to win
[54:56] but they said the Lord will deliver but
[54:59] deliver what
[55:01] deliver Ramos Gilead deliver the syrians
[55:05] deliver what sounds like some of the
[55:07] modern day prophets we've got today in
[55:08] it there's somebody here in the building
[55:10] today that's got a pain yeah who ain't
[55:14] oh I feel somebody's got a burden yeah
[55:17] who ain't
[55:19] that's the kind of prophets these guys
[55:21] were
[55:22] go up for the Lord shall delivered unto
[55:24] the king to the hand of the king and
[55:27] Jehoshaphat said
[55:29] is they're not here
[55:32] a prophet of the capital L capital O
[55:36] capital r capital D
[55:38] now wait a minute we've got 400
[55:42] Hebrew Prophets
[55:45] but there's something about these old
[55:46] boys just didn't ring right it just
[55:49] didn't sound right didn't feel right
[55:51] it's just something was wrong
[55:55] so Jehoshaphat said is or not a prophet
[55:57] of the Lord
[55:59] besides that we might inquire of him
[56:04] and the king of Israel said unto
[56:05] Jehoshaphat
[56:08] there is yet one man
[56:12] IA the son of emblem
[56:14] by whom we may inquire the Lord now even
[56:17] this backslidden King knew who had the
[56:20] word
[56:23] but
[56:24] I hate him
[56:27] yeah that's a sign he's a good man of
[56:29] God right there
[56:31] but I hate him
[56:33] for he does not prophesy good concerning
[56:37] me well how could he
[56:40] but evil
[56:42] and Jehoshaphat said oh
[56:46] let not the king say so
[56:51] I'd like to be remembered as we pray
[56:53] today
[56:55] Heavenly fathers we bow our heads
[56:59] we're asking you Lord that you would
[57:01] take your word and speak to us
[57:04] father I have my hands on these prayer
[57:08] clothes that sister Ruth Ann Carter sent
[57:11] the request for her family members Lord
[57:14] you know these needs and you're aware of
[57:17] them today and I lay my hands on them
[57:20] and I will wear them and while you're
[57:22] anointing is here today I pray in the
[57:26] name of Jesus that you would go to these
[57:28] needs and these requests
[57:30] there were hundreds of hands that were
[57:32] uplifted across this building today
[57:35] signifying needs desires petitions we
[57:39] ask that you would help us
[57:41] speak to us today by your word may our
[57:44] faith be increased to where we can
[57:47] ask and believe
[57:50] and watch you manifest yourself in our
[57:52] midst today
[57:53] in the name of the Lord Jesus the word
[57:55] we pray
[57:56] amen
[57:58] God bless you you may be seated
[58:03] look with me if you were to verse 11.
[58:09] so now there's 400 of these Prophets
[58:13] they are Hebrews
[58:16] they are message preachers we'll say
[58:20] so they're not prophets of Baal
[58:23] they're not prophets of some other false
[58:26] god
[58:27] but they are compromising Prophets
[58:31] and they're going to tell this King what
[58:34] he wants to hear
[58:36] because it's the type of prophets that
[58:38] they are and he knew that that's why I
[58:41] asked for them first
[58:43] and a Jehoshaphat would not have asked
[58:46] for a real servant of God
[58:48] no doubt Ahab would have never even
[58:51] mentioned his name
[58:53] but because Jehoshaphat even though he
[58:56] was kind of fellowshipping around Ahab
[58:59] and hanging around in him some and you
[59:02] know just been a friend and a buddy and
[59:04] a pal and however you want to say it but
[59:07] yet he still knew that God
[59:10] had a way and he wanted to be right this
[59:13] man wanted to be right before the Lord
[59:15] so let's pick up in verse 11.
[59:19] and zedekiah the son of kinea
[59:22] made him horns of iron
[59:25] I remember prophets use symbols
[59:29] remember one of the prophets of the Old
[59:32] Testament uh made a yoke Jeremiah
[59:35] another one would take and dig a hole
[59:39] through a wall
[59:40] and he would lay on his side for so many
[59:42] days and then turn over and lay on his
[59:45] other side so this false prophet what he
[59:49] decided to do was to use a symbol and a
[59:53] sign
[59:54] so notice what he does he made him horns
[59:57] of iron
[59:59] so he goes and he hand crafts these
[1:00:02] horns and he brings them up maybe sticks
[1:00:06] them up on the side of his head here he
[1:00:08] comes maybe he's pawing around and
[1:00:11] snorting and boy he really puts on some
[1:00:14] drama my all the people are sitting
[1:00:17] there looking at him and waiting to hear
[1:00:19] what he's got to say
[1:00:21] and he says thus saith the Lord
[1:00:25] thus saith
[1:00:27] the Lord now watch him capital L capital
[1:00:31] O capital r
[1:00:34] capital D
[1:00:36] now he is more deceiving than the others
[1:00:41] he moves in to the channel
[1:00:44] that he knows Jehoshaphat wants to hear
[1:00:49] now he puts his horns up will say thus
[1:00:52] saith the Lord with these
[1:00:55] Thou shalt push the Assyrians until they
[1:00:59] have thou hath consumed them
[1:01:04] now this old boy Ventures a little
[1:01:06] further than the rest of the 400.
[1:01:10] now he's gonna go down into a realm
[1:01:14] to where something has moved on him
[1:01:18] that apparently is somewhat different
[1:01:21] than the others
[1:01:23] he's going to bring the prophecy more
[1:01:26] personal
[1:01:28] he's going to absolutely stand up and
[1:01:32] swear a lie
[1:01:34] against Jehovah God
[1:01:37] Prophet says it this way any man that
[1:01:40] says thus saith the Lord and the Lord
[1:01:42] didn't say it that man deserves to go to
[1:01:45] hell
[1:01:47] that's quite a statement is it not
[1:01:50] now notice he says
[1:01:53] Thou shalt take these horns
[1:01:56] and you'll push the syrians plum back
[1:02:00] oh boy he calls these other gods to
[1:02:03] Rally I'm telling you what they started
[1:02:05] feeling something brother Donnie do you
[1:02:08] think they felt something I am a hundred
[1:02:11] percent
[1:02:12] convinced these people were feeling
[1:02:16] something
[1:02:18] and they were feeling a spirit
[1:02:25] but it just wasn't the Holy Ghost
[1:02:28] now notice what the Bible says and all
[1:02:32] the prophets
[1:02:34] prophesied so
[1:02:36] so here now they've got a leader
[1:02:39] the others are more generic more General
[1:02:43] but a leader stands up a leader prophet
[1:02:47] and whenever he becomes specific then
[1:02:51] they become specific
[1:02:53] so he said by these horns you'll run
[1:02:57] them out well all the rest of these guys
[1:02:58] they didn't have horns but they just
[1:03:00] maybe give up and stick up their their
[1:03:02] fingers like you glory to God hallelujah
[1:03:05] glory to God the saith the Lord
[1:03:08] you're gonna write them out
[1:03:15] go up to Ramos Gilead
[1:03:17] and prosper
[1:03:19] for the Lord now notice here they've
[1:03:22] changed their word too capital L capital
[1:03:25] O capital r
[1:03:28] capital T just a couple of verses prior
[1:03:30] to this
[1:03:31] they were not saying this word but what
[1:03:34] did they do they modified in their
[1:03:37] deception
[1:03:39] so if you all want to hear capital L
[1:03:42] capital O capital r capital D we really
[1:03:45] don't believe Jehovah is this but if
[1:03:48] that's what you all need to hear us say
[1:03:51] we will change our sermon
[1:03:54] [Music]
[1:03:56] so you will think we believe
[1:04:01] let me tell you something friend if you
[1:04:03] don't have the Holy Ghost today
[1:04:06] I'm warning you
[1:04:08] as a servant of God
[1:04:10] you better get it
[1:04:13] before it's too late
[1:04:15] because the deception in the last days
[1:04:18] is going to be so strong and so powerful
[1:04:22] that only the elected will escape the
[1:04:27] power of this hour that we're in
[1:04:31] although I've been around the message I
[1:04:32] don't care how long you've been around
[1:04:33] the message you don't withstand
[1:04:35] deception by Years Around the word
[1:04:38] there's only one way to do it sealed by
[1:04:42] the author of the word
[1:04:45] now my thought today again is what we
[1:04:48] went along the lines of last Sunday
[1:04:50] whose report
[1:04:52] will you believe
[1:04:54] now it's a little bit different than
[1:04:56] Sunday but we'll just give me a little
[1:04:57] bit of time here
[1:04:59] and the messenger now notice
[1:05:02] so they go to get this other guy
[1:05:06] Micah and the messenger that was called
[1:05:09] to call Micah spake unto him saying
[1:05:11] behold now the words of the prophets
[1:05:14] declare good
[1:05:16] unto the king
[1:05:18] with one Mouse
[1:05:20] they're all saying the same thing
[1:05:22] because I was right there and I heard
[1:05:24] them say it
[1:05:26] let Thy word I praise it be like the
[1:05:30] word of one of them and speak that which
[1:05:34] is good
[1:05:35] because we're all on TV and they're all
[1:05:38] on radio and they're all on podcasts and
[1:05:42] they're all saying the same thing
[1:05:44] America is fixing to have a Revival I
[1:05:47] mean we're fixing to give our hearts
[1:05:49] back to God and the Russians is going to
[1:05:51] be blowed away don't worry about the
[1:05:53] Russians they'll never get to us we're
[1:05:55] the Great Mighty America you better not
[1:05:58] listen to that lie America is doomed I
[1:06:02] said America is doomed the prophet
[1:06:04] didn't even pray for as a nation before
[1:06:07] he left how much worse is she today are
[1:06:10] there individuals that can still be
[1:06:12] saved yes but our nation is beyond
[1:06:15] Redemption friends
[1:06:17] but of course that's not what they want
[1:06:19] to hear they want to hear that God is
[1:06:22] going to turn it all around again and
[1:06:24] our nation's going to come right back to
[1:06:26] God oh sure I agree there will be many
[1:06:29] many people that will think they're
[1:06:31] getting saved after the Rapture after
[1:06:34] the bride is done gone when The Mercy
[1:06:36] Seat is totally empty of blood there
[1:06:39] will not be one Speck of Blood On The
[1:06:41] Mercy Seat nor will God hear any
[1:06:43] sinner's prayer for repentance and yet
[1:06:46] they will be crying like never before
[1:06:48] Baptist Churches Methodist churches
[1:06:50] message churches that miss the Rapture
[1:06:53] all kinds of churches will be a people
[1:06:55] will be thwarting and why shouldn't they
[1:06:58] hailstones will be falling out of Heaven
[1:07:00] that'll weigh a hundred pounds apiece
[1:07:02] the prophets will stand Moses and Elijah
[1:07:05] and they'll call fire out of Heaven
[1:07:07] they'll call hail they'll call for
[1:07:09] whatever they want it will scale the
[1:07:12] liver out of people people will go to
[1:07:14] church they will scream they will run to
[1:07:16] God they will be reading their Bible
[1:07:18] they'll be doing like they've never done
[1:07:20] before
[1:07:22] except
[1:07:24] too late
[1:07:28] whose report are you going to believe
[1:07:31] today that's the question
[1:07:33] now notice so this guy kind of drops a
[1:07:36] bug in his ears we would say but he's
[1:07:39] talking to the wrong fella here
[1:07:41] and Micah said as the Lord live us what
[1:07:44] the Lord says unto me that will I speak
[1:07:48] now notice in verse 15 as he goes into
[1:07:52] this so he came to the king now he's
[1:07:55] already got this warning now we're just
[1:07:56] giving you a little bit of notice up
[1:07:58] front there pal you've been
[1:08:00] disassociated for a long time everybody
[1:08:03] kind of looks at you as being a
[1:08:05] relegated y'all hear by yourself look
[1:08:07] there's 400 men and they're all saying
[1:08:10] the same thing who in the world do you
[1:08:12] think you are anyhow one little old
[1:08:14] scrapping guy that's out here by himself
[1:08:17] you have no recognition among the big
[1:08:19] denominational heads why you don't even
[1:08:22] get invited to preach conventions no
[1:08:24] more they don't love you they don't care
[1:08:26] for you and yet you feel like you're the
[1:08:28] only ones right why look man get some
[1:08:30] reason get some sense you're getting a
[1:08:32] little bit of age on you you're going to
[1:08:33] need a little Medicaid and a little
[1:08:35] Medicare and a little bit of Social
[1:08:37] Security and a little bit of retirement
[1:08:38] join in with us we'll put you on a
[1:08:41] friendship he said I'll not say nothing
[1:08:44] but what the Lord tells me to say God
[1:08:47] give us such men today
[1:08:49] so he came to the king
[1:08:52] and the King said unto him my cup
[1:08:56] shall we go up against Ramos Gilead to
[1:09:00] battle or shall we forebear
[1:09:04] and he answered him go
[1:09:08] and prosper
[1:09:10] for the Lord
[1:09:13] shall deliver it
[1:09:15] and to the hand of the king
[1:09:20] oh my goodness
[1:09:23] so he's saying the same thing
[1:09:26] the false prophets said
[1:09:30] he did
[1:09:32] out of scorn
[1:09:36] he's actually making fun of them
[1:09:40] and the king oh but now wait a minute
[1:09:42] what if there were some of these believe
[1:09:44] the sign people
[1:09:46] that would have been in the days of
[1:09:48] Micah and then they would have took this
[1:09:50] statement and then took the next
[1:09:53] statement which I'm fixing to read to
[1:09:55] you and say right here Micah said one
[1:09:57] thing and right over here he said
[1:10:00] something else
[1:10:03] now this is in your Bible if you don't
[1:10:05] apply the same standard to this Prophet
[1:10:07] that you do to our Elijah in this day it
[1:10:10] means you're a hypocrite and a liar
[1:10:12] and the church said
[1:10:15] all right now notice he answered him go
[1:10:17] and prosper for the Lord shall deliver
[1:10:21] it into the hand of the king did you
[1:10:22] notice in reading this he says identical
[1:10:25] the same thing then Prophet said word
[1:10:28] for word
[1:10:30] so he does an answer but notice he
[1:10:32] doesn't say this in the name of the Lord
[1:10:36] he doesn't say thus saith the Lord thus
[1:10:39] speaketh the Lord he doesn't even say it
[1:10:42] in his own face but he says it out of
[1:10:46] scorn and ridicule
[1:10:49] I watch this and the King said unto him
[1:10:52] now you say how can you how can you say
[1:10:54] that he done that because the king
[1:10:56] himself when he heard this sound this
[1:10:58] demeanor and he hears the sound of his
[1:11:01] voice he knows immediately he ain't
[1:11:03] telling him right
[1:11:05] and the King said unto him how many
[1:11:08] times
[1:11:10] how many times shall I assure thee that
[1:11:14] thou tell me nothing but that which is
[1:11:16] true in the name of the Lord now we
[1:11:18] don't want to hear it but he gets mad
[1:11:20] when he don't hear it how can you help
[1:11:22] people like that
[1:11:24] believe me I deal with them all the time
[1:11:26] they want you to tell them the truth
[1:11:28] until you tell them the truth and then
[1:11:30] when you tell them the truth they got
[1:11:31] mad that you told them the truth
[1:11:35] so what's a preacher supposed to do I'll
[1:11:38] tell you what he's supposed to do tell
[1:11:39] you the truth anyway and then if you
[1:11:42] don't like it well you'll meet it at the
[1:11:44] day of judgment
[1:11:46] oh my
[1:11:47] God how many times shall I jury thee
[1:11:50] that thou tell me nothing but that which
[1:11:51] is true
[1:11:54] In The Name Of The Lord
[1:11:56] and he said I
[1:11:59] saw
[1:12:03] Saul now he breaks into the fourth
[1:12:05] dimension
[1:12:07] and tells us his vision
[1:12:11] I saw all Israel
[1:12:14] scattered upon the Hills
[1:12:16] as sheep
[1:12:18] that have not a shepherd
[1:12:21] now he's giving us the word of the Lord
[1:12:24] not scorn not ridicule but the vision
[1:12:29] and the Lord said
[1:12:32] these have no master
[1:12:34] let them return every man to his house
[1:12:38] in peace
[1:12:39] and the king of Israel said unto
[1:12:41] Jehoshaphat
[1:12:42] did not I tell thee that he would
[1:12:45] prophesy no good
[1:12:48] concerning me but evil
[1:12:51] all right now we're not in 2023 any
[1:12:54] longer we're back in First Kings 22.
[1:12:59] and you all
[1:13:01] have just heard 400 prophets prophesy
[1:13:05] to the king
[1:13:06] you've heard another one come up with
[1:13:09] horns
[1:13:10] and then you've heard this other guy
[1:13:12] come up and say
[1:13:14] I saw Israel
[1:13:16] scattered like sheep having no Shepherd
[1:13:20] so which report are you going to believe
[1:13:29] her brother how will I know it's really
[1:13:33] quite simple it's not that hard
[1:13:35] you judge what they're saying take it
[1:13:39] back to the word
[1:13:41] now what did the word say before the
[1:13:44] Prophet Elijah said that God would feed
[1:13:48] this man and the dogs would lick his
[1:13:51] blood and the dogs would eat Jezebel's
[1:13:54] body
[1:13:57] so he checked his vision by the word
[1:14:00] but could the 400 chapters by the word
[1:14:04] they couldn't
[1:14:05] they wouldn't they should not they'd
[1:14:09] lose their pension
[1:14:10] they lose their setting at the table of
[1:14:12] the king now these guys were very
[1:14:14] privileged because they were able to sit
[1:14:16] around the table of the king and there
[1:14:17] was kind of his pets as we would say so
[1:14:20] he bought him a new Chariot every now
[1:14:22] and then and give them a new horse every
[1:14:24] now and then and kind of kept them
[1:14:26] really good so if he wanted to look real
[1:14:28] religious before the rest of Israel he'd
[1:14:30] call the prophet Sam hey come on guys
[1:14:31] come on in tell me a good word from the
[1:14:34] Lord what go on up Old King Hallelujah
[1:14:36] you're just the Blessed of the Lord and
[1:14:38] I'm the smiley preacher from Texas and
[1:14:41] God loves you so much and we're not
[1:14:43] preaching against nobody and we're not
[1:14:46] going to blast nobody if that man don't
[1:14:48] get saved he'll burn in hell I'm telling
[1:14:52] you what every preacher that stands up
[1:14:54] and knows the truth and will not tell it
[1:14:56] to the people will be lost one day till
[1:14:59] you realize them people in the regions
[1:15:01] of the Lost are going to be hunting for
[1:15:03] preachers do you know what they're going
[1:15:06] to do when they get down and that
[1:15:08] regions of the Lost they're going to be
[1:15:10] looking for them preachers that led them
[1:15:13] astray and preached ever and Damned
[1:15:16] their soul to hell
[1:15:28] I don't want nobody looking for me
[1:15:41] and he said here therefore
[1:15:44] the word of the Lord
[1:15:47] I saw
[1:15:50] the Lord
[1:15:52] sitting on his throne
[1:15:54] now notice Micah
[1:15:56] I call true Prophets
[1:15:59] he's not a trinitarian
[1:16:01] so he didn't say I thought I saw three
[1:16:04] Thrones and there was an old man and
[1:16:06] there was a younger man and there was a
[1:16:08] spirit being sitting over there but like
[1:16:10] John he saw one throne and one who said
[1:16:14] on it
[1:16:16] I saw the Lord sitting on his shoulder
[1:16:18] all the hosts of Heaven
[1:16:20] standing by him on his right hand and on
[1:16:24] his land now this is the true epitome of
[1:16:27] Heaven not a miniature God an amateur
[1:16:29] God a younger God and an old God but God
[1:16:32] himself and the host on the right hand
[1:16:34] and the host on the left hand
[1:16:37] and the Lord said who shalt persuade
[1:16:40] Ahab that he may go up and fall at Ramos
[1:16:45] Gilead
[1:16:47] now listen friends what we're dealing
[1:16:49] with
[1:16:50] and one sat on this manner and another
[1:16:53] set on that manner and there came forth
[1:16:55] a spirit now listen it was a fallen
[1:16:59] angel which come up out of hell
[1:17:04] so he comes up out of the regions of the
[1:17:07] Lost
[1:17:09] Before the Throne of God and said I will
[1:17:13] persuade him
[1:17:16] now here is a being that one time stood
[1:17:19] in the presence of God and worshiped God
[1:17:21] and adored God and magnified God but of
[1:17:26] course Satan split them in heaven
[1:17:29] and this was one of them that followed
[1:17:30] the split
[1:17:32] from the Holy Angels to those who lost
[1:17:35] their estate so Jude says
[1:17:38] so they followed the devil and now he
[1:17:42] comes up out of hell can you imagine he
[1:17:44] comes up and says hey you need me to do
[1:17:47] something for you
[1:17:49] is there anything that I could do
[1:17:53] so here comes this lying Spirit out of
[1:17:57] hell
[1:17:59] oh my Lord
[1:18:02] and he says
[1:18:04] I will persuade him
[1:18:08] and the Lord said unto him we're with
[1:18:12] and he said I will go forth and I will
[1:18:15] be a lying spirit
[1:18:19] in the mouth
[1:18:21] of all look at the word
[1:18:24] ah
[1:18:28] All His prophets
[1:18:32] even that devil recognized that them
[1:18:36] prophets was not speaking the word of
[1:18:38] the Lord but they were ahab's possession
[1:18:43] friends could you really respect me
[1:18:46] could you really respect any man of God
[1:18:49] that will preach only what you want to
[1:18:52] hear could you really respect any
[1:18:55] servant of God that knows if you've got
[1:18:57] sin in your life and you would honestly
[1:18:59] rather he didn't deal with that to make
[1:19:02] you feel better there's something wrong
[1:19:03] with you if you feel that way oh sure it
[1:19:06] may hurt our feelings and trample all
[1:19:07] over our feet I'd rather preacher tear
[1:19:09] me up one side and down the other and
[1:19:11] spare me out of hell instead of tipping
[1:19:13] my ear
[1:19:21] NOW Watch What Happens
[1:19:23] and he said Thou shalt persuade him
[1:19:27] and Prevail also
[1:19:30] go for us and do so so here comes this
[1:19:33] lying spirit and it comes down there and
[1:19:36] gets in the mouths
[1:19:38] of these false prophet message preachers
[1:19:45] so no doubt they're saying that glory to
[1:19:47] God
[1:19:48] feel it all over
[1:19:50] there's not a question in my mind they
[1:19:52] felt something all over them and no
[1:19:55] doubt they felt led
[1:20:00] check what you feel led to do by God's
[1:20:03] word
[1:20:07] God will never lead any of us
[1:20:10] contrary
[1:20:17] listen to this and the anointed ones the
[1:20:18] end time the prophet said a lying Spirit
[1:20:20] come up out of hell
[1:20:23] and fell down on his knees
[1:20:26] and said if you will permit me I can
[1:20:29] give them my anointing
[1:20:32] now here is a lying spirit
[1:20:35] so the lying Spirit comes and gets in
[1:20:37] the mouths of these prophets and
[1:20:39] surrenders his anointing and now they're
[1:20:43] standing there prophesying lies with the
[1:20:46] anointing of a demon
[1:20:50] and now remember you're the people
[1:20:52] sitting there
[1:20:57] you're sitting there hearing these men
[1:21:00] so what would you have said
[1:21:04] what would you have done what would have
[1:21:06] been your response when the 400 said
[1:21:08] Co-op go up and then there's one
[1:21:10] emotional God runs the pebble's horns on
[1:21:12] over his head oh man a spirit fill the
[1:21:15] place and the people oh yes yes I feel
[1:21:18] it I know this is God I know it is
[1:21:21] I wonder how many of us
[1:21:23] we're gonna say yes yes
[1:21:27] and you would have joined your ranks
[1:21:31] with a demonic anointing
[1:21:36] you say this is scary brother Donnie you
[1:21:38] better believe it's scary
[1:21:45] how can we know for sure how can we know
[1:21:47] we won't be deceived we stay with his
[1:21:50] word
[1:21:56] I can give them my anointing now notice
[1:21:58] how brother Brandon paraphrases this
[1:22:00] scenario make them do any kind of sign
[1:22:04] or wonder you mean a lying devil
[1:22:09] a lying Spirit can get on people and
[1:22:12] they will actually prophesy lies and
[1:22:16] perform Miracles too
[1:22:22] we'll be judging by their signs you're
[1:22:24] already on your way to deception
[1:22:26] you don't judge a man by signs wonders
[1:22:29] miracles
[1:22:32] you judge them by the word of God we
[1:22:35] believe in signs wonders miracles do we
[1:22:37] not but we believe the word has
[1:22:39] preeminence over every gift remember
[1:22:41] your Prophet says in Harvest Time
[1:22:43] December the 27th 1964 Satan can hand
[1:22:48] out those spiritual gifts
[1:22:50] by the handfuls
[1:22:54] you imagine the devil having access to
[1:22:58] hand out spiritual gifts
[1:23:01] by the handfuls
[1:23:07] praise the Lord
[1:23:10] I can give them my anointing make them
[1:23:12] do any kind of sign or wonder now this
[1:23:14] is what he wants to do
[1:23:16] just as long as I can get them off
[1:23:22] the word
[1:23:24] he won't even know that that is your
[1:23:27] word he'll ignore it for popularity
[1:23:30] brother times hasn't changed y'all to
[1:23:33] hear Brother random's voice haven't
[1:23:34] listened this in a while y'all too you
[1:23:36] ought to hear Brother Brown's voice as
[1:23:37] he hollers this out and expresses it and
[1:23:40] then he speaks directly to brother
[1:23:42] Neville brother Neville that's true
[1:23:45] remember that's true
[1:23:49] I don't think them words it's just for
[1:23:51] brother Neville I think for the word of
[1:23:53] Life church today I believe they're
[1:23:56] forever message church around the world
[1:23:58] Satan is on the prowl
[1:24:05] oh my
[1:24:07] I'll get upon him and make him do the
[1:24:11] same things the rest of them does
[1:24:13] I'll make him prophesy
[1:24:16] and tell a lie how could it be a lie he
[1:24:19] says because it was contrary
[1:24:22] to the word
[1:24:25] now here's Micah again in verse 23 now
[1:24:28] therefore behold the Lord
[1:24:31] has put a lying spirit
[1:24:34] and the mouth of all these thy Prophets
[1:24:40] oh
[1:24:43] and the Lord hath spoken evil concerning
[1:24:46] thee
[1:24:48] zedekiah the son of Chennai went near
[1:24:52] and smelt Micah
[1:24:55] on the cheek
[1:24:57] and said which way did the spirit of the
[1:25:00] Lord for me to speak unto thee and Micah
[1:25:03] said behold Thou shalt see in that day
[1:25:06] when thou shalt go unto an inner chamber
[1:25:09] to hide thyself
[1:25:13] whose report will you believe
[1:25:19] so we got a whole congregation over here
[1:25:22] 400.
[1:25:24] glory to God hallelujah I feel it all
[1:25:28] over me praise the Lord go up go up
[1:25:32] revivals in the land it's coming it's
[1:25:35] coming it's coming revival is here no
[1:25:39] judgment is here
[1:25:44] and we've got one little guy
[1:25:47] standing over here
[1:25:48] what seems to be by himself
[1:25:53] now just by counting numbers which one
[1:25:55] would you sideways
[1:26:00] oh you said that that's history no this
[1:26:03] event is history but the same thing is
[1:26:06] actually going on again today
[1:26:09] it's going on in our church it's going
[1:26:10] on in every other message church around
[1:26:12] the world people are going to decide
[1:26:14] whose report will they believe are they
[1:26:18] going to believe the report of the Lord
[1:26:19] are they going to believe a report that
[1:26:22] sounds like the report of the Lord
[1:26:24] remember our twin will not come quoting
[1:26:28] Billy Graham
[1:26:29] I have twin will not come quoting other
[1:26:33] men of great great Renown our twin will
[1:26:37] quote the same Prophet you quote
[1:26:40] and the church said if you can't say
[1:26:43] Amen say ouch all at least know you're
[1:26:44] alive okay
[1:26:46] now notice
[1:26:48] the king of Israel said
[1:26:52] take Micah
[1:26:54] and carrying back to am on the governor
[1:26:56] of the city and to joest the King's son
[1:26:58] and say thus saith the king bless God
[1:27:02] I'll show him
[1:27:05] thus saith again put this fell into
[1:27:08] prison and feed him with bread of
[1:27:10] Affliction I'm with a water of
[1:27:12] Affliction until I come in peace
[1:27:16] Micah said if thou return at all in
[1:27:20] peace the Lord hath not spoken by me
[1:27:24] and he said hearken all people
[1:27:31] so now he knew Ahab is not going to
[1:27:33] listen but then what does he do he
[1:27:35] pleads to the people
[1:27:38] listen people hearken people
[1:27:43] yeah I imagine alarms
[1:27:45] crazy guy
[1:27:47] why knucklehead
[1:27:49] who in the world is going to believe a
[1:27:51] radical type of a guy like that
[1:27:54] my goodness I want the kind old priest
[1:27:57] type of Pastor that lets you do whatever
[1:28:00] you want to do and live any way you want
[1:28:02] to live well you know God don't look at
[1:28:04] the outside an old an old barn needs a
[1:28:07] new coat of paint I agree Barnes do but
[1:28:10] women's faces don't
[1:28:12] paint your barn just don't paint your
[1:28:14] wife
[1:28:16] well praise the Lord why what difference
[1:28:18] does it make if you wear a mini skirt or
[1:28:20] don't don't you know where Richard what
[1:28:22] difference does it make it if men dress
[1:28:24] in women's clothes it's an abomination
[1:28:27] in the eyes of our God
[1:28:29] well come on now Saints
[1:28:31] well brother Donnie what difference does
[1:28:33] it make if a man marries a man or a
[1:28:35] woman marries a woman because that's not
[1:28:37] the original plan show me where God ever
[1:28:39] ordained such and I'll marry one next
[1:28:42] week but since the Lord God made man and
[1:28:45] woman and he didn't marry Adam and Steve
[1:28:47] but he married Adam and Eve he did not
[1:28:51] marry marry together Eve and Mary or
[1:28:54] even Jane but it was Adam and Eve
[1:28:57] together and that's the way I plan on
[1:28:59] keeping it as long as I marry folks in
[1:29:02] this church now I know some folks don't
[1:29:04] like it they don't want to hear it
[1:29:06] preached you see any care in these eyes
[1:29:08] I'm going to stand before God one day
[1:29:10] and when I do I want to be able to walk
[1:29:12] up there and say Lord God I stood for
[1:29:15] the truth I was hated I was despised I
[1:29:18] was rejected I want to hear him say come
[1:29:21] on in Donnie I'm proud of you you stood
[1:29:24] for me in the evil day anybody want to
[1:29:27] go in with me and you might want to say
[1:29:29] yes Lord we believe the report of the
[1:29:33] lord we also bore that chain we for the
[1:29:37] reproach and we're so glad we did
[1:29:41] [Applause]
[1:29:49] so just hold it in your mind now
[1:29:52] so what if you would have said in that
[1:29:55] day
[1:29:56] I believe those men are telling the
[1:29:58] truth
[1:29:59] those 400.
[1:30:01] and then a true prophet of God
[1:30:03] identifies that voice
[1:30:05] is from hell
[1:30:08] would you been man or woman enough to
[1:30:10] admit
[1:30:12] that you were wrong
[1:30:13] and you were misled
[1:30:20] the honors quiet as a bunch of Church of
[1:30:21] Christ this morning
[1:30:25] you see it takes a big man
[1:30:27] a big woman
[1:30:29] to be able to admit they were wrong
[1:30:32] and that they were actually the
[1:30:34] influence of a demon
[1:30:38] well praise the Lord and if you can find
[1:30:40] a preacher that'll say he was under the
[1:30:42] influence of a demon you have found a
[1:30:44] real prize
[1:30:46] well I felt led to do this I'm not
[1:30:48] saying preachers don't feel led to do
[1:30:49] various things but what I like to do is
[1:30:51] trace it back to the word
[1:30:54] and see if they're leading is coinciding
[1:30:57] with the word
[1:30:58] well there's preachers around the world
[1:31:00] that are feeling led to set down
[1:31:02] and quit preaching and just push
[1:31:08] oh now if you can show me where God's
[1:31:10] Prophet ever said any such thing
[1:31:12] beginning Wednesday night we will turn
[1:31:15] this into a push play Church
[1:31:18] show me anywhere the Bible Institute
[1:31:21] such or God's Prophet said it'll come to
[1:31:24] pass after I'm gone that the best way to
[1:31:27] have the perfect word is for every
[1:31:30] preacher to sit down I don't blame the
[1:31:32] devil If I Was the Devil I'd want all
[1:31:34] them Holy Ghost filled preachers to sit
[1:31:36] down too that gives me a greater desire
[1:31:39] to preach instead of shut up it gives me
[1:31:41] a greater desire to burn his hide from
[1:31:44] Hades and back because I know how he
[1:31:47] hates true anointed men of God how he
[1:31:51] hates men of God in their home he don't
[1:31:53] want to just shut the preachers up he
[1:31:55] wants to shut you fathers up he wants to
[1:31:58] shut you mothers up don't get your mind
[1:31:59] just on the preacher part if he can shut
[1:32:02] the preachers down then your next move
[1:32:04] into the home and he'll shut the daddies
[1:32:06] up oh Father quit telling them what to
[1:32:08] do no brothers tell your children
[1:32:10] instruct them the way they ought to Live
[1:32:12] come on children mothers instruct your
[1:32:15] daughters how they ought to dress how
[1:32:17] they ought to live how are they on the
[1:32:19] wall why because your voice is a dying
[1:32:22] voice as far as the world is concerned
[1:32:25] but as long as we're alive God will have
[1:32:27] people on the Earth that will never
[1:32:30] compromise we will never we are
[1:32:33] outnumbered we are outnumbered as far as
[1:32:37] the world goes but as far as heaven
[1:32:39] heaven is on our side
[1:32:47] so before we move to Jeremiah
[1:32:51] I ask you again
[1:32:53] whose report
[1:32:56] do you believe
[1:32:59] Jeremiah chapter 20 verse 9 then I said
[1:33:03] I will not make mention of him
[1:33:07] nor speak any more in his name
[1:33:12] poor Jeremiah
[1:33:14] he's one of my favorite of all the Old
[1:33:16] Testament prophets but I feel so sorry
[1:33:19] for him
[1:33:20] and the sense of reading about his life
[1:33:22] and all that the man went through
[1:33:25] he was treated terrible absolutely
[1:33:28] terrible
[1:33:29] and Jeremiah just got to a spot to where
[1:33:32] he said I can't take it no more
[1:33:35] I just can't handle it
[1:33:37] I've tried to stand for what's right
[1:33:39] I've tried to do what's right people
[1:33:40] don't want it
[1:33:42] you give them your life they turn and
[1:33:44] walk away from you don't even have a
[1:33:46] common respect to come and talk to you
[1:33:48] and say they love you I really don't
[1:33:51] care for love that way
[1:33:53] you give people your life you lose sleep
[1:33:56] over them you sweat over them you labor
[1:33:58] over them you lead them to Gods you lead
[1:34:00] them to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:01] and they get tired of you and they'll
[1:34:03] turn and go the other way and never even
[1:34:06] come and speak to you about it
[1:34:08] and that's the kind of people of
[1:34:09] Integrity this message produces if that
[1:34:12] is I quit today
[1:34:17] but you see the true message
[1:34:19] I produce such stuff
[1:34:22] notice so Jeremiah says I'll not make no
[1:34:25] mention of him nor speak anymore in his
[1:34:29] name I can't take it
[1:34:34] then Jeremiah found a little key
[1:34:37] and he said his word was in my heart
[1:34:41] as a burning fire
[1:34:44] shut up in my bones
[1:34:47] and I was weary with forbearing in other
[1:34:51] words I was weary of keeping my mouth
[1:34:55] shut
[1:34:56] so the people made him weary because he
[1:34:59] opened his mouth but he found out a
[1:35:01] secret God can make you more weary than
[1:35:03] the people can if you don't
[1:35:07] oh my and I could not stay
[1:35:12] now notice their report
[1:35:15] of what Jeremiah was hearing
[1:35:17] for I heard the defaming
[1:35:21] look at the word whispering
[1:35:23] defamation
[1:35:25] evil report
[1:35:29] unfavorable
[1:35:31] saying
[1:35:33] well I used to follow the messaging but
[1:35:36] I found out that brother Bram said this
[1:35:38] over here and that over there and I
[1:35:39] found that brother random was a human
[1:35:41] well you should have been listening to
[1:35:42] some true anointed preachers and they
[1:35:43] would have told you that already
[1:35:46] he never said he was a God or an angel
[1:35:48] he said he was a human being who made
[1:35:49] all kinds of mistakes I wish somebody
[1:35:50] would say Amen to that
[1:35:52] but they found out oh my they're they're
[1:35:54] the imagination of what they had was a
[1:35:57] prophet of their imagination and they
[1:35:59] took every word that he said is thus
[1:36:01] saith the Lord and then come and find
[1:36:02] out what he changed on this and he
[1:36:04] changed on that sure just like Paul did
[1:36:06] just like Moses did just like Joshua did
[1:36:09] just like all men do because no man is
[1:36:12] infallible
[1:36:13] I said no man is infallible
[1:36:18] Jeremiah says I heard the defaming of
[1:36:21] many and fear on every side
[1:36:24] Reports say they and we will report oh
[1:36:28] here we've got the report now so they're
[1:36:30] telling him you report and we'll report
[1:36:33] you
[1:36:34] we're going to turn you into the
[1:36:36] authorities
[1:36:39] you can't turn me into nobody hiring
[1:36:41] Jesus
[1:36:42] so go ahead and turn me in if you want
[1:36:44] to
[1:36:45] to him
[1:36:47] Reports say they and we will report it
[1:36:51] familiar
[1:36:54] from my halting and the word halting is
[1:36:57] limping and stumbling so you can imagine
[1:37:00] now you've got people just watching
[1:37:03] they're not watching for good
[1:37:05] they're not watching for benefit they're
[1:37:07] watching they're listening there's
[1:37:08] people that still listen to our services
[1:37:10] the same way
[1:37:12] they listen to Everything I preach
[1:37:15] trying to find fault trying to find
[1:37:17] error you think that don't put you under
[1:37:19] a burden you think they don't put you
[1:37:21] under strength but let me just speak to
[1:37:23] some of them spies this morning and say
[1:37:27] that's what I fear about you report me
[1:37:30] to YouTube if you want to report me to
[1:37:33] CBS and NBC and ABC they've already done
[1:37:36] it it didn't stop me did it it didn't
[1:37:38] stop us as the people of God so we say
[1:37:41] like Jeremiah we will report a yearly
[1:37:45] part but you will report defamation and
[1:37:49] lies and what will we report thus say is
[1:37:53] the Lord
[1:37:54] [Applause]
[1:38:01] it's all my familiars watched which was
[1:38:04] friends and Neighbors all my familiars
[1:38:07] watch for my halting or my limping
[1:38:09] saying pure Adventure he will be enticed
[1:38:13] and we shall Prevail against him
[1:38:15] and we shall take our revenge
[1:38:18] this is their report
[1:38:21] sort of like yours today of whatever
[1:38:23] you're going through you see friends
[1:38:25] times really hasn't changed that much
[1:38:27] your enemies are just by different names
[1:38:30] we don't have the enemies that Jeremiah
[1:38:32] did but it's the same demons out of hell
[1:38:35] and we shall take our revenge on him
[1:38:38] that was their report but listen to
[1:38:41] Jeremiah's report
[1:38:42] Jeremiah 20 and 11 but the Lord
[1:38:46] it's with me
[1:38:48] as a mighty terrible one
[1:38:52] as a mighty Gabor a mighty Captain a
[1:38:57] mighty warrior the Lord now Jeremiah
[1:39:00] said oh no I know that they're
[1:39:02] overwhelmingly I better not do it
[1:39:04] anymore I I just repent I pretend I'm so
[1:39:06] sorry I shouldn't have never said that
[1:39:07] and if he would have listened and
[1:39:09] listened like we do sometimes they don't
[1:39:11] even trying there ain't no need nobody
[1:39:13] loves you nobody appreciates you oh you
[1:39:15] fought this battle of sickness and this
[1:39:17] and that and the other you can believe
[1:39:18] that report if you want to or you can
[1:39:21] believe this report but the Lord is with
[1:39:24] me as a mighty terrible one how many can
[1:39:27] raise your hand and say the Lord is with
[1:39:30] me the Lord is with me despite my
[1:39:34] failures despite my mistakes despite
[1:39:36] your mistakes and your shortcomings he
[1:39:39] said I will never leave you I will never
[1:39:43] forsake you that includes shortcomings
[1:39:45] that includes falling flat on your face
[1:39:49] [Music]
[1:39:51] [Applause]
[1:39:58] but the Lord is with me as a mighty
[1:40:01] terrible one
[1:40:03] therefore my persecutor shall stumble
[1:40:07] they're watching for me to stumble but
[1:40:10] actually the contrary wise is going to
[1:40:12] happen my persecutors are going to
[1:40:14] stumble they're looking to run me down
[1:40:17] but they're the ones going to be run
[1:40:18] down

[1:40:22] stumble and they shall not Prevail they
[1:40:24] shall be greatly ashamed for they shall

[1:41:35] well we're going to Rally behind
[1:41:36] Jeremiah
[1:41:39] or Daniel or David or Noah whoever it
[1:41:41] was in our day this day Elijah we're
[1:41:44] going to Rally behind that message and
[1:41:46] say we will bear the reproach we will
[1:41:49] stand if we have to stand by ourself we
[1:41:52] will stand because if we stand for him
[1:41:54] he will stand for us if we stand with
[1:41:58] them what will they do they will turn
[1:42:00] their backs on us that's what they'll do
[1:42:02] you don't want to sell out Jesus for the
[1:42:04] world you don't want to sell out Jesus
[1:42:06] for a compromising denominational system
[1:42:09] because they will turn their back on you
[1:42:16] laughs
[1:42:18] well praise the Lord
[1:42:20] let me just tell you today how God wants
[1:42:22] us to stand
[1:42:24] in this hour
[1:42:26] into the sermon title called the god
[1:42:27] call man
[1:42:29] the prophet said oh you sons of God move
[1:42:32] out into that sphere Yonder Fearless
[1:42:38] fear less
[1:42:42] is there anybody here today don't raise
[1:42:44] your hand but just ask yourself this
[1:42:46] question in your heart is there anybody
[1:42:48] that could say Beyond a shot of a doubt
[1:42:50] I'm totally Fearless today
[1:42:56] you'll see my hands up dear
[1:43:00] you see friends were living beneath what
[1:43:02] God wants God wants us to be Fearless
[1:43:07] how many has ever been moneyless
[1:43:11] okay you're with me now how many has
[1:43:13] ever been pretty less
[1:43:16] I'll say Brothers raise their hands on
[1:43:17] that well that's good I'm glad I didn't
[1:43:19] have no suppressified 65 million in here
[1:43:22] we've been all kinds of less things
[1:43:25] ain't we
[1:43:26] but there's one thing God wants us to be
[1:43:28] less fear less
[1:43:31] which means what we're less severe why
[1:43:35] we ain't got enough room in our hearts
[1:43:38] to have fear and faith together
[1:43:40] so if we're going to leave one of them
[1:43:42] out God says leave out fear be Fearless
[1:43:45] brother Donnie are you kidding me do I
[1:43:49] look like I'm kidding
[1:43:51] listen to this he goes on to say God
[1:43:53] today is trying to empty the world out
[1:43:55] of us and get us to empty ourselves out
[1:43:59] and be Fearless men and women
[1:44:03] oh praise the lord Jimmy not only the
[1:44:05] brothers no the sisters too
[1:44:08] who love God
[1:44:10] I must stay with God I cross the
[1:44:13] separating Line Jordan
[1:44:15] that he can use
[1:44:17] for his glory
[1:44:20] notice this
[1:44:21] it says hallelujah we know what we're
[1:44:23] going to at the end of this journey God
[1:44:26] is Promised amen there's a land beyond
[1:44:29] the river be Fearless
[1:44:33] in your testimony
[1:44:36] amen if it's revealed to you
[1:44:39] you are
[1:44:41] Fearless
[1:44:45] Fearless
[1:44:47] how many needs some things revealed to
[1:44:49] you today it's up here but why ain't we
[1:44:52] Fearless it ain't been revealed to us
[1:44:54] enough wonder why we don't spend enough
[1:44:56] time in prayer could it be we'd rather
[1:44:59] be playing basketball and football and
[1:45:01] soccer and this and that and the other
[1:45:03] than spending time with prayer God make
[1:45:05] me Fearless God make me a Fearless
[1:45:08] daughter God make me a Fearless teenage
[1:45:11] boy a teenage girl anybody here
[1:45:13] listening to me today is there anybody
[1:45:15] here that wants to be that type of a
[1:45:18] believer that you can look to devil in
[1:45:20] the face and say I shall not be moved
[1:45:24] Hallelujah like a tree planted by the
[1:45:27] water I am Fearless
[1:45:37] we looked at Little David facing Goliath
[1:45:40] with the sling and his Stone
[1:45:44] but let's look at him in another battle
[1:45:47] which is a little bit more difficult
[1:45:50] Psalm 3 1.
[1:45:52] a Psalm of David
[1:45:56] when he fled from Absalom
[1:45:58] his son
[1:46:03] Lord
[1:46:05] how are they increased
[1:46:07] that trouble me
[1:46:09] many are they that rise up against me
[1:46:13] now it's not a Goliath
[1:46:16] it's not even a Saul
[1:46:18] it's Absalom his son
[1:46:21] what does Absalom want
[1:46:24] his kingdom
[1:46:27] and it looks like for a little bit
[1:46:30] he would get it
[1:46:34] again now I say if y'all were living in
[1:46:37] the days of Absalom and King David
[1:46:40] whose side would you be on
[1:46:47] well some of y'all joined ranks with
[1:46:48] Absalom
[1:46:50] with some of the message people join
[1:46:52] ranks
[1:46:53] with Absalom
[1:46:56] they would they already have them
[1:47:00] [Music]
[1:47:02] against God's anointed king
[1:47:07] did the prophet anoint Absalom no
[1:47:12] was it through God's Divine Protocol no
[1:47:16] and yet the majority of the army and a
[1:47:19] great portion of the people of Israel
[1:47:22] with Jonah ranks with him it shows how
[1:47:24] ignorant that people can be
[1:47:29] and never ceases to amaze me how easily
[1:47:33] deceived sheep really are
[1:47:36] you thank the Lord Jesus called us sheep
[1:47:38] as a compliment you need to study the
[1:47:40] life of a sheep a little bit better and
[1:47:42] you realize it was not so much a
[1:47:44] compliment it was an act a face in him
[1:47:47] recognizing that he was their Shepherd
[1:47:49] but also sharing how gullible
[1:47:53] how easily fleeced sheep can be how
[1:47:57] easily deceived that sheep can be and
[1:48:00] won't even check the word to see should
[1:48:03] I do this should I do that is it right
[1:48:05] to do this wrong to do that well don't
[1:48:06] sit there and look at me it's the truth
[1:48:10] notice so David is now had to leave
[1:48:13] Jerusalem and who's there in the capital
[1:48:15] his son
[1:48:18] his son Epsilon
[1:48:21] so David is now running again as it did
[1:48:23] in the days of Saul now we love this
[1:48:25] song Here of Psalm 3. but I guarantee
[1:48:28] you one thing David wasn't loving it
[1:48:30] whenever he was going through it Harry
[1:48:32] maybe there be would say of my soul
[1:48:36] there is no help for him in God
[1:48:44] can you imagine Israelites
[1:48:47] now these were not the moabites and the
[1:48:50] ammonites and the Hittites these were
[1:48:52] message people
[1:48:55] saying this about David there's no help
[1:48:57] for him
[1:48:58] the guys he's gone
[1:49:01] now remember what he had done taken
[1:49:03] Bathsheba
[1:49:05] there's no mercy fund the guys send away
[1:49:07] of deus Graves there's no more Mercy for
[1:49:10] the man at all there is no help for him
[1:49:12] in God
[1:49:15] but was that the way God felt about it
[1:49:18] it wasn't
[1:49:20] so all of them that said that lied
[1:49:26] over into a new move now wonder the move
[1:49:29] of Absalom got started baby God's going
[1:49:32] to displaced safe he's going to get rid
[1:49:34] of him we don't need Elijah no more they
[1:49:36] don't need the prophet of God no more
[1:49:37] we're in a new generation we don't need
[1:49:39] to have to stand himself with all the
[1:49:40] prophet said the prophet said we don't
[1:49:42] need all that we're in a new generation
[1:49:43] you may be speak for yourself
[1:49:46] I'm still staying with what a prophet
[1:49:48] has already said myself
[1:49:50] come on children somebody say Amen Let
[1:49:53] The Devil know whose side shown today
[1:49:55] somebody say Amen
[1:49:56] [Applause]
[1:50:01] all kinds of Elders too
[1:50:04] rulers captains of the people
[1:50:09] oh and David said many there be would
[1:50:11] say of my soul
[1:50:13] there is no help for him in God now this
[1:50:16] is their report
[1:50:19] it would have been very easy for David
[1:50:21] brother John to took their report and
[1:50:23] said well maybe there ain't
[1:50:25] he said brother Johnny what's that got
[1:50:27] to do with us everything every one of
[1:50:29] these examples I've used this morning
[1:50:30] you bring them right over into our day
[1:50:32] it's not going to be an Absalom so much
[1:50:34] it's not going to be a zedekiah it might
[1:50:36] be a cancer it might be blood pressure
[1:50:38] it might be a family member but don't
[1:50:40] you see they're going to work the exact
[1:50:42] same way they want you to say what they
[1:50:45] believe about you they don't want you to
[1:50:47] say what father believes about you so if
[1:50:50] they can get you to say what they say
[1:50:53] they will rob you of your victory
[1:50:56] well I can't be saved I can't be
[1:50:58] delivered I've sinned away I've done
[1:51:00] this and that and the other if that's
[1:51:01] what you choose to believe you will be
[1:51:04] lost but if you believe God is a
[1:51:07] merciful god if you'll believe that God
[1:51:09] can forgive you there is forgiveness for
[1:51:12] you
[1:51:14] but you will have to accept
[1:51:17] [Music]
[1:51:21] but I love this verse 3.
[1:51:24] but thou
[1:51:28] are the shield for me
[1:51:33] my glory and the lifter of my head
[1:51:40] now he's saying exact opposite what
[1:51:43] absalom's saying he's saying exact
[1:51:45] opposite of what the captains are saying
[1:51:47] and the sergeants are saying but he
[1:51:49] hadn't heard God saying what the
[1:51:51] sergeant was saying he hadn't heard God
[1:51:53] say what Absalom will say he still
[1:51:55] remembered what God Said I will make my
[1:51:58] Everlasting Covenant with you and my
[1:52:01] mercies will not forsake you as a matter
[1:52:04] of fact I will give you what God called
[1:52:07] the sure mercies of David
[1:52:11] first time in the Bible God ever
[1:52:13] identified mercies with a man and called
[1:52:17] mercies after a human servant
[1:52:20] the sure Mercies
[1:52:25] oh
[1:52:31] can you imagine David trying to
[1:52:33] encourage himself
[1:52:34] God's going to help me through this
[1:52:37] God's going to help me
[1:52:40] it must have been so discouraging
[1:52:43] so disheartening
[1:52:44] he leaves his crown he leaves his throne
[1:52:48] he leaves his concubines his son goes
[1:52:51] into his concubines and lays with them
[1:52:53] takes his father's Crown sets upon his
[1:52:56] father's throne and starts passing
[1:52:59] passing statutes and laws in the Kingdom
[1:53:02] as if he was the king
[1:53:08] David had to reach down
[1:53:11] find something Beyond this son something
[1:53:15] Beyond his generals
[1:53:18] found
[1:53:20] thou O Lord
[1:53:23] a shield for me
[1:53:26] notice in verse 4 I Cried unto the Lord
[1:53:31] with my voice
[1:53:34] and he heard me
[1:53:36] now you see many of us will say oh I
[1:53:38] cried and I cried they didn't hear me
[1:53:39] don't you say that again
[1:53:45] now when David says this nothing had
[1:53:48] happened yet
[1:53:49] but he says I know he loves me and I
[1:53:52] know he hears him
[1:53:56] I Cried unto the Lord with my voice and
[1:53:58] he heard me
[1:53:59] out of his Holy Hill
[1:54:02] Salah
[1:54:04] I laid me down and slept well something
[1:54:08] must have happened
[1:54:09] now this must have been pretty
[1:54:11] outstanding brother felt no doubt David
[1:54:13] had had a lot of sleepless nights or he
[1:54:14] wouldn't have mentioned it this way now
[1:54:16] for those of you that go to bed in about
[1:54:18] 30 seconds you're gone would you please
[1:54:19] come and tell me after church what you
[1:54:21] do I would love to know I would give a
[1:54:23] hundred dollars a night sometimes to be
[1:54:25] able to do that to be able to lay down
[1:54:27] but my mind's going this way and that
[1:54:28] way and that way and the other way and I
[1:54:30] wake up at three and then I wake up at
[1:54:32] five then I wake up at six I think I
[1:54:34] might as well get up and then I'm
[1:54:35] dragging around all day and you look at
[1:54:37] me he's hungover and all that ain't hung
[1:54:39] over slept over I didn't get no sleep
[1:54:40] over the night oh hi David must have
[1:54:43] wrestled and David must have sweated it
[1:54:44] out but David said once God revealed to
[1:54:47] me that he's on my side what Absalom is
[1:54:51] saying is not what God said what the
[1:54:53] captains are saying is not what God said
[1:54:56] what the generals are saying is not what
[1:54:58] God Said but God said I love you David
[1:55:09] I laid me down
[1:55:15] and I awaked
[1:55:18] I know for some of you that don't really
[1:55:20] mean that much
[1:55:22] but if you don't sleep you can't awake
[1:55:28] so because David woke up
[1:55:32] it was a sign of victory
[1:55:35] how many woke up this morning
[1:55:37] oh while the rest of y'all didn't seek
[1:55:38] money either God bless your heart come
[1:55:40] see me after church we'll cry on one
[1:55:42] another's shoulders
[1:55:44] I laid me down and slept I awaked and
[1:55:48] this is why
[1:55:49] for the Lord
[1:55:51] sustain
[1:55:54] I will not
[1:55:56] be afraid of ten
[1:55:59] thousands now not ten thousand but ten
[1:56:03] thousands which is multiple bands of ten
[1:56:07] thousand so it could have been ten
[1:56:09] thousand plus another ten plus another
[1:56:11] ten plus another 10 plus another 10
[1:56:13] because by now Absalom had gathered the
[1:56:16] great portion of the children of Israel
[1:56:18] against David now this is not
[1:56:21] Philistines this is not Hittites
[1:56:24] this is message for
[1:56:30] again I ask you
[1:56:32] whose report
[1:56:34] would you have believed
[1:56:37] would you have sneaked out of Jerusalem
[1:56:39] and left your business
[1:56:42] which you sneaked out of Jerusalem and
[1:56:44] left your bakery
[1:56:45] some of your brothers left your real
[1:56:47] estate some of your brothers left your
[1:56:48] cat converter truck oh boy that been a
[1:56:51] big step wouldn't it
[1:56:52] now David said I'm going to narrow pass
[1:56:54] or going up this mountain up to mount
[1:56:55] Getty in order to get up there that
[1:56:57] you'll have no room for that converted
[1:56:58] truck Brothers you ain't gonna have no
[1:57:00] room for that Bakery of yours you don't
[1:57:01] have no room for this and that it's
[1:57:03] going to be a dangerous route nearly all
[1:57:05] the armies of Israel is against us from
[1:57:07] Israel not six people
[1:57:10] [Music]
[1:57:12] David said I will not be afraid
[1:57:16] them thousands of people if a man could
[1:57:18] do this without the Holy Ghost
[1:57:20] hold up wait a minute
[1:57:23] that have set themselves against me
[1:57:26] round about
[1:57:30] let me share a few verses with you from
[1:57:31] my favorite Psalm one of my favorite
[1:57:35] one of the reasons this is one of my
[1:57:37] favorite because

[1:58:33] times since I've been a Christian

[2:04:31] be some kind of embarrassed
[2:04:38] oh I'll tell you one thing I'll send a
[2:04:40] quote uh brother and send it to me
[2:04:41] yesterday and I'd shared with some other
[2:04:42] brothers his God and said please I don't
[2:04:44] even know how many times I've listened
[2:04:46] to that sermon and brother I'm talking
[2:04:48] about worshiping God he said we ought to
[2:04:50] go have come of that expectation and he
[2:04:52] said we ought to worship God right now
[2:04:54] like we're going to worship him then I
[2:04:56] thought Lord have mercy we ought to
[2:04:58] worship God right now like we're going
[2:05:00] to worship Him you mean this is the way
[2:05:02] y'all are going to do this is the way
[2:05:04] we're going to do we're sitting down
[2:05:06] you're just barely able to clap our
[2:05:07] hands and Nod our head and that's the
[2:05:09] way we're going to do heaven not me
[2:05:11] brother not me brother Joel oh I want to
[2:05:15] worship him with all of my heart I want
[2:05:18] to worship him with all of my strengths
[2:05:20] all of my might
[2:05:31] I don't know I have great joy
[2:05:35] Because I obey God Commandments
[2:05:38] and I remain in his love
[2:05:41] John 15 11.
[2:05:45] because I have written love and
[2:05:46] faithfulness on the tablet of my heart
[2:05:50] I have favor with God
[2:05:52] Proverbs 3 3.
[2:05:58] there's a bunch more but I want to save
[2:06:00] them until next week
[2:06:05] whose report
[2:06:10] you're going to believe your failures
[2:06:12] mistakes
[2:06:13] you're shortcomings the weaknesses
[2:06:16] doctor's report
[2:06:19] you're going to believe God's
[2:06:21] it's quite astounding you know when
[2:06:22] brother Brandon will tell people that if
[2:06:24] they had cancer
[2:06:25] he said he couldn't really bother you
[2:06:27] too bad unless you feared it
[2:06:31] that don't even make good sense well of
[2:06:33] course it don't because you're not
[2:06:34] processing the gospel through your head
[2:06:36] it comes to your heart a lot of Malachi
[2:06:38] four believers they got the message
[2:06:40] right up here but it's never moved from
[2:06:42] there to here all the word had quite a
[2:06:44] distance to travel from Heaven to the
[2:06:45] Earth it had quite a distance to reach
[2:06:47] the people all over the world in Malawi
[2:06:49] in Zimbabwe all the different islands of
[2:06:51] the world but the farthest distance at
[2:06:53] the head the heart the word of God has
[2:06:55] to travel is from here to here when we
[2:06:58] store it up here like a hard drive I've
[2:07:00] got so many terabytes of the message in
[2:07:01] my head it don't do a bit of good I'd
[2:07:03] rather have three or four megabytes down
[2:07:05] in my heart than three or four terabiths
[2:07:07] up in my head if we can get it down here
[2:07:09] look out devil here we come
[2:07:11] that's why I want to keep it right there
[2:07:13] and it keeps us paralyzed it keeps us
[2:07:15] full of fear full of anxiety I'm afraid
[2:07:18] to testify the last time I testified all
[2:07:20] hell broke loose that means y'all to
[2:07:22] testify again
[2:07:23] oh but I'm going to wait till they get
[2:07:25] here if I should like go ahead and
[2:07:26] testify right now but brother Donnie the
[2:07:28] doctor says I'm going to die go ahead
[2:07:30] and plan a vacation out to Arizona
[2:07:31] somewhere go ahead and look up a cruise
[2:07:33] on some ship are you going to believe
[2:07:35] the Lord's report are you going to
[2:07:37] believe what the devil says if I believe
[2:07:39] what the devil says I'll never preach
[2:07:41] again if I believe what the devil says
[2:07:43] I'll never open my mouth do you all want
[2:07:46] me to believe what the devil says
[2:07:48] Oh you mean you want me to believe what
[2:07:51] the Lord says but you choose to believe
[2:07:53] what the devil said

[2:08:04] than Overcomers

[2:08:09] in our hearts can we Face it with a
[2:08:12] smile on our face and the joy of the
[2:08:14] Lord down inside of our soul can we have
[2:08:17] joy unspeakable and full of Glory

[2:09:24] he is my Fortress he is my shield
[2:09:27] thou O Lord
[2:09:29] or the shield for me
[2:09:31] the lifter up of my head
[2:09:34] what I'm facing a Philistine a line or a
[2:09:37] giant
[2:09:38] or on Epsilon a brother who has set
[2:09:42] yourself
[2:09:45] I don't mind telling you that's been
[2:09:46] some of my hardest battles oh I've had
[2:09:48] some others too that was pretty tough
[2:09:50] but my most heartbreaking moments
[2:09:54] has been when a brother would set
[2:09:56] yourself against you how many knows what
[2:09:58] I'm talking about you've been there and
[2:10:00] done that of course you have oh my God
[2:10:02] so what do we do we just pick up
[2:10:06] but you don't fight with an attitude
[2:10:09] you don't fight with a old temper or
[2:10:11] bitterness or none of that oh no we go
[2:10:13] right on and we forgive but I don't even
[2:10:15] if they don't ask us to forgive them
[2:10:18] show me where the Roman soldiers asked
[2:10:20] Jesus to forgive them show me where the
[2:10:22] people at the foot of the cross ask
[2:10:23] Jesus but he said father forgive them he
[2:10:26] wants us to be able to forgive the way
[2:10:28] he forgave
[2:10:29] in other words every times you'll have
[2:10:31] to forgive people when they don't even
[2:10:33] ask you as a matter of fact they don't
[2:10:34] even care enough about you too asking
[2:10:37] you want to be like Jesus or not or we
[2:10:40] just want to heal the sin is that what
[2:10:41] we want we just want to heal the sick
[2:10:43] raise the Dead cast out Devils have
[2:10:44] discernment suffocational people we're
[2:10:46] real spiritual I have known people in my
[2:10:48] life that could cast out Devil's lay
[2:10:49] hands on the sick and have the office
[2:10:51] attitude in your life you ever imagined
[2:10:53] but see you never saw that did you all
[2:10:55] you saw was them working under the
[2:10:57] anointing
[2:10:58] I don't want just an anointing that'll
[2:11:00] heal I want anointing that will change
[2:11:02] me
