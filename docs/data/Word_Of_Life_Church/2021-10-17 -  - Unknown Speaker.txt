i never saw the many many burdens that might save your bore and i never saw the crown of thorns that my jesus wore and i never saw that lonely where he was he was [Music] oh crucified i believe for me

nails that they drove through his hands and feet oh and i wasn't there to hear him say to his father why hast thou forsaken me [Music] and i never saw those roman soldiers when they pierced him deep in his side but when he hung his head in the locks of his shoulders i believe for me he died [Music] and every step that he took [Applause] [Music] drop a bloody said he said for me [Applause] there's a lot of things may may not see [Applause] oh thank you jesus but i believe i believe when jesus died he died thank you jesus i may [Music] jesus died he died for me [Applause] thank you somebody's

[Music] this morning don't we i'm sorry if i didn't get to all of you but we'll do we'll do better now 34 years ago a much younger pastor and a much younger pastor's wife come here to take over and be our our spiritual guide that's brother donald's sister carol october has been deemed pastor appreciation month and as good as brother donald's preached through the years right now he's at his peak i believe that with all my heart do you feel that way too he's doing he's doing a wonderful wonderful job and we certainly appreciate brother donnie and sister carol we have a card of just appreciation and i want you just to really realize this morning what god has favored us with here on this little hill we no better nobody but god has highly favored us and i certainly appreciate it don't you a lot of you here from all over all over the country different states different places but god has put us together god has given us a wonderful shepherd and a wonderful shepherd's wife and we certainly appreciate him with all of our heart give them a nice hand this morning if you will [Applause] so there we go thank you bill louie i appreciate it i was a lot younger as louie said my hair was a lot darker this is pretty strong here not too much um not too much any of us can say about how good all of us have been are they how wonderful we are there's only one great one and that's the lord and his mercy to us all i do appreciate it him letting us be together and walk together in life's journey and we know that this is the shortest time that we'll ever have together so we certainly look forward to that time when all of our troubles and our difficulties will will be laid aside i'm not brother louie you all look so good it's so good to see all of you here today we just so appreciate the opportunity to be together we cherish it and the meetings and louisiana the lord really helped and brother ron brother wayne did an outstanding job they said that some of the people that had visited the services there hadn't been able to be in church actually physically in church for two years two years so even though we've had it hard yet we've been able to come to church so thank the lord for that are you here today expecting the lord to just give you something in your heart your life how many knows we need we need him we need his help and need his guidance let's turn to ephesians chapter one if you would i certainly want to continue to remember those that are sick and some aren't feeling well today reason they haven't been here to church and um after the meeting there brother tim several got sick actually brother tim cancel their service again today for the jason watkins as well they'll be resuming lord willing next week and i have several in their assembly that's sick so we want to pray for them as well god would just move for them help them ephesians chapter 1 verse 22 and 23 and then we'll read chapter 2 verse 6 and 7. i hope you don't mind me reading these things i've read these scriptures for a couple of different times but if we could understand it what we're about to read actually here today is christ the mystery of god revealed this was part of his entire purpose from eternity what we're fixing to read about as put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body so the church is the body the fullness of him that filleth all in all chapter 2 verse 6 and has raised us up together made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness toward us through christ jesus verse 10 for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god has before ordained that we should walk in them well if he ordained that i do it i want to do it with all of my heart chapter 5 verse 23 the great conclusion now of this mystery for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church he is the savior of the body the savior of the body and then paul goes on down on a few verses and he tells us that as christ loved the church so men also to love their own wives for he that loveth himself loveth his wife catching from the great mystery of what god had gave to adam in the garden of eden whenever he looked at his wife and said you are now born of my bone and flesh of my flesh in other words you are me in another expression and this is what the lord intended that his church should be how many has a need today in your heart request on your heart can we just take it before the lord father we love you so much today we are so honored to be in your place here that we have set aside called a church we know lord that the building is not the church but it's the people but this building has been hallowed or sanctified set apart that we could come here to sing to worship to pray to be able to be called the house of god father we're asking you now that you would help us our needs are many but our god is greater than all of our needs put together lord we have so many requests and needs and father my heart now going to different parts of the country even around the world or just hearing of another pastor passing away this morning and lord different ones that are very sick lord brother jason to mars in the hospital and i see you and certainly needing to touch from you today father different ones lord and we're praying that your great hand would reach to them in kindness and in mercy some not here today father because they're not feeling well some being exposed and lord they felt it would be safer for the rest of the saints if they didn't come so we pray that you bless them even as they sit at home and stream the service today for those of us that are present we acknowledge to you lord god that we need you so much lord most of my life i've been living for you but i need you now more than ever before i need you every day every hour lord jesus i'm so thankful that you've opened your word to our hearts once again will you speak to us today these great truths bring us into a great union and harmony i ask in the name of the lord jesus and the saints said amen god bless you you may be seated two major images given in the bible the church is a family the church is a body both mystical and natural local assemblies we can see this pictured in the book of acts as the lord god baptized the first human beings with the holy ghost outside of jesus christ in acts chapter 2. when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all in one place one accord there the spirit of god began to move on these people's souls and capture them and captivate their beings and perform what the lord jesus had announced that would come and that was a new birth it was a marvel even that nicodemus heard this first idea of a new birth and said how can a man when he is old enter the second time into his mother's womb you can imagine that if you would have been there and heard the lord jesus say except a man be born again he cannot see or understand the kingdom of heaven in his mind him thinking born again the second time enter into my mother's womb how can that be and jesus said you being a teacher in israel and you don't understand these things but we know that the mystery of it was not even really made clear by the lord jesus himself in the form of teaching it was going to be made clearer in the form of experience we can teach the new births we can have quotes and scriptures and theology but it will never be clear to the human heart the human soul until one experiences that for themselves once it happens to them then they don't really need just to be able to read about it but they have experienced it on their own i trust everybody in this building today has had that to happen to you we can hear it sung about preached about talked about read but yet when one knows that they have passed from death unto life their soul has been brought into the original image that adam had in the beginning an image of oneness that could only be received by the breasts of god so you can sign your name on a church book shake a preacher's hand go to a beautiful church large assembly or small whatever it would be that doesn't mean bring you in to the spiritual body of the lord jesus there's only one way to get there and that is by according to what paul said in first corinthians for by one spirit are we all baptized or immersed into that mystical spiritual body but yet the mystical part of the family of god does not do away from the local assemblies for we see immediately after the church received the holy ghost then we see they started gathering together on what was called the first day of the week so the mystical part was that which could not be seen but the mass the nature the natural aspect of it was they started gathering in homes or gathering in buildings and then from there it became called the church so paul by the time he wrote some 30 years later after the day of pentecost he would address the church which was in this one's house or the church in that one's house or to the church of corinth now they didn't name their churches what we do today word of life tabernacle word of life church or even light tabernacle but actually mainly for the most part initially when the churches started they were called the church of laodicea the church of ephesus the church of philadelphia so they were called the church or the gathering place in a certain city then as the churches began to grow and they would have one and then another and another then they would take on another name and they would begin identified as what we know today so today we call them the missionary baptist or the faith baptist or this or that or the other or happy valley church why we call that because years ago when the church moved here from roan hill they took on the identity of this particular place where we are located happy valley so we call it happy valley church of jesus christ and what does that identify that does not identify the mystical body but that identifies this local assembly that we have here so in the picture of the family of god we can see how the lord jesus wants to continue his work in this body called the church so the church is the wife now when i say that i don't mean everybody that is called church because we know there's two churches one of them is the true church of the living god the other are imposters actually they gather together they call themselves church but the lord jesus is not their head they have men as their head men vote them in men vote them out men sin here they've been to this so it's actually men but the lord jesus desires a body that will be his own masterpiece in the making and they will be a group of people that will be gathered together under his auspices in other words they do not have a denominational headquarters and the bishops and the overseers say okay you all do this and you all do that and you all do something else and we're moving this pasture from this location to this one and we're setting this guy there no the bible tells us the holy ghost sent them out to preach so it was not a gathering of people that's the church we believe in today now the lord jesus desires to continue that same work that he started in the book of acts let's change over brother eric to the handheld whenever he started that out okay battery's dead on this harry come help me the lord jesus started that out in the mystical body get off her hair gunner and change batteries for me and the top drawer on the right in the mystical body that would be baptized by the holy ghost in that he made five different diversions of how he would minister to the saints of god and we call it the fivefold ministry the lord of course did not have that in the old testament but he had mainly prophets and judges by which he would speak to the people then he ordained a priesthood which would bring the sacrifices from the lord from the people rather into the presence of the lord but in the new testament the lord decided to go a different way so he's not going to have a levitical priesthood he's not going to have judges but he's going to have ministry that will come and minister to the saints of god and of course we know there's apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers they are to be the living representation of the voice of god in every age now we know that he would have one major prophet that would appear once in an age that would come and speak to the saints of god he would catch the mind of god and the word logos of course means the mind of god or the mandate of god for the day and a major prophet would catch that from god and then the other ministry would go out from underneath that one apostles and teachers and so on and they would begin to replicate what god had given to that pastor then god would continue the same work that he started in the book of acts so god has not changed his format at all but it's exactly the same yesterday today and forever so he started it out in the book of acts the way he wanted it now he's going to manifest himself in the form of apostles of prophets evangelists pastors teachers and that is actually going to be god's way that he will close himself in the form of an army inside his body on the earth so god will represent himself in the form of these five offices and these five offices will represent the way that god will minister to the body now that does not mean that the body is not important within itself because in the body will be there will be diversities of government there will be all kinds of aspects in the body and keeping your in your mind because you're not a preacher does not mean that you are not important to the mystical body and also the local body so what if we do away with everybody here today that's not preachers we're going to have about three or four people that are sitting here in this body so god does not mean that just because you're not a preacher that you're a laity that you're not important you are very important to the body and nobody can take your place and the church said why because that's the way god designated then in that god would have those that would be given certain abilities some would sing some would be used in the office of ministry some would be used in the office of administration they would be there to help and we know of course there was no deacons in the old testament but whenever the diversity of the government of the body changed then the the apostles themselves they said it's not right that we should wait on tables because there was widows and there was people that was not getting their needs met and the ministry was being pulled in that way and the apostles said it's not right that we should be pulled away from the word and then we should wait on tables you've got these needs so they didn't say well you know the widows are not important and the the homeless are not important they did not believe that they believed they were important but they said what we need we need to designate a new member in the body of christ that will start administering to these offices and they come up with the greek word dickiness which is deacon now from that it means the word minister or one that will minister to so then we find that the deacons were placed into the body and they started ministering to what more to the natural needs now deacon of course can be apt to teach and all that but it certainly does not mean that a deacon is to be a preacher but the deacon is to minister to the people on their everyday level and if they've got needs and they're lacking of this and that and the other and god orchestrated that in the body and it was something that god has never taken away to this day now initially even the first few years of the early church they never had what we have today and that is the office of a trustee because the church did not own any property but as the church began to grow and they had houses and they had church buildings and so on then there was a need for trustees especially dealing with the banks of course in this day the banks want a board of trustees so it's a board of men that are able to be responsible for the finances of the church so as the church grew then things began to happen why you'd have never been able to probably convince peter and james and john that one day preachers would be able to stand in the pulpit like we are today and at the same time that you are hearing my voice here in johnson city tennessee there are people in canada and france and in norway in europe and africa all over the world in a few seconds after i say these words they're hearing it as well so then what do we need well if we've got that technology we have to have people in the body that understand how to fix that technology i'm glad it ain't dependent on me because i'll tell you one thing if it was left up to me to know how to do streaming and all that i don't know one thing about it and the majority of you don't either do you but yet we're glad that we can do it and then what did god do god give us people not only in our assembly but in assemblies around the world that would know how to do such things so as the need arose then god would facilitate that by people in that body that would help minister to that particular need now i realized some of these are unseen folks some of you don't even know who takes care of the internet whenever it's down all you know is whenever you can't get on there you get mad and aggravated or you try to get on there and you're buffering all the time and whatever more and you contact whoever you think is in charge and you want it fixed i mean right now asap you don't want to waste no time you want it done but yet if it was not for people behind the scenes that knew how to do that where would we all be and it's the same way in the spiritual sense of the body that god can move on some people's hearts they may never get up and sing they may never get up and prophesy or preach a sermon but yet they are prayer warriors and god will wake them up in the wee hours of the morning and put brother daryl on their heart by the west or some of his other brothers or myself and they don't even know why they may never get any credit as we call it in this life and some positions in the body are those that do not render a bunch of glory but it is unseen it is almost as if it is not there except for those who are part of it and those that receive the benefit from doing it aren't you glad god does it that way there are some in the church and it seems as if though they are the ones that get so much of the honor and the glory and you remember there was instances by which the prophet would go into a city and he would have great meetings and my the blind would be be able to see the lame wall and brother random would give credit not only to himself and say well i've done this i'm the prophet and i've done that but he would mention those people that were praying for the meetings and he would mention those that had fasted for days on end before he came to their city and god took their prayer and their sincerity and some of the folks that day that received their healing it wasn't just because brother branham was there but it was coupled together with those who had a burden on their heart for their city or for their church don't you understand friend that the preacher does not bring revival in his briefcase the preacher does not bring a great stirring in his briefcase to the church but sometimes it can be a little sister or a little brother in the church and heart and nobody even knows that they're there but god lays a burden on their heart lord we need a stirring in our church god we've got sick people in our church lord we need a visitation of healing in our church and yet the spirit of god may move and people come up and are prayed for maybe i lay hands on him brother west does one of the other minister brothers here and we lay hands on them and you see god heal them and you totally attribute it to that because brother joel brown laid his hands on somebody's head and they turn in their testimony on wednesday night brother joel prayed for me and god healed me well thank god that brother joel had faith to do it but it might have been somebody else who also had a burden on their heart as well and yet we don't say well saint god sister so-and-so prayed why because it's just like the anatomy of the human body there's things about our body we have never seen we've never seen our insides we've never seen the parts that are absolutely so vital for life and yet take our heart out our kidneys out our liver many other things of us that's on the inside and we would no longer be able to live or exist it's the same way with the body there are people in the mystical body of christ and they will never be renowned oh you know your friend it's hard to imagine but i thank god for pastors in and around this message and many of them are not called to be convention speakers many of them will never step up before a great crowd of people and never be called by various brothers to come and preach a special meeting or come and speak at a convention they're just not called that way but yet they pastor their little small church 25 or 30 or 50 or whatever it is they may never travel around the world they may never leave their own country and yet they're just as faithful as they can be and they serve the lord jesus with all of their heart and yet god may put on their hearts and they may be burdened for other men of god who are called to travel that way that is a great revelation from god that a person can hold an inferior smaller position and still be able to acknowledge those that as we would say may be greater gifted than they are and not be jealous well i wish somebody would preach with me today but it's always something about the human race especially after adam fell and threw us into this thing of competitiveness and how do we look at this man and it's so hard for us many times to see people that are gifted above us or better than us and not to feel some sort of resentment or a little bit of jealousy now if y'all get any quieter on me than what you are now i don't know how i'm going to be able to finish this but i want you to notice that it is a great thing to acknowledge in the body of the lord jesus that there are some that are so gifted my goodness i hear some preachers preach and i say wow it ain't no wonder that they're called on to preach so much because they're so gifted others that can sing and they just sing and sing and sing and i'm saying if i could sing like that that's probably all i do i just go around like a mockingbird i'd just sing at 24 7. i'd sing in my sleep i'd sing when i'm eating i'd sing i'd just sing sing sing so i guess that's why the lord didn't give me too well to sing but i'm glad that if we've got people like that aren't you but yet for us to be able to acknowledge of what the lord does that when god gives people and places them in the body it is actually for the benefit of the body itself god does not give people just so that they can be looked up to and they can be acknowledged as this great so-and-so this great piano player this great guitar player this great singer but actually god places them in the body for the body is that right then god chose to minister in this way now we know that god created even in the beginning that god created by degrees now i know people don't like this but actually still in heaven when we roll back into eternity where we came from there will still be degrees in eternity but the difference is we will not have the human element which cannot take degrees very well there will be degrees and there were degrees and angels there were cherubims there were seraphims there were zooms that were angels which were called by paul elect angels and there were other angels which were put on a place of probation listen to me now and they were actually creative so they are not of eternal essence so they were angels which were created remember lucifer was created thou was perfect from the day that thou was created so lucifer amen had a day that he began he had a day when he started and he'll have a day when he will end that's right but there are other angels which were not created out of time substance they were not brought into view and they were actually elect angels and you and i i hope you understand this our theophany body is a part of that supernatural element of the angelic host which never failed in the beginning so it is our angel in the presence of god then god wanted to have a body on the earth that would be able to carry out his work so they would minister to the sick they would preach the word they would be able to just not only do that now for the church body but they would have a heart for fallen humanity now you know i realized a lot of folks get so caught up in humanitarian aid and they think that the church of the living god basically that's what the church is all about it's not just about humanitarian aid but neither should we be so spiritual that we don't care about the human needs of those around us one of these days at the day of judgment when we stand there and all will be unfolded of what this church has done around the world you're going to find out that we've not just printed books and we've not just duplicated tapes and sent out things but we have done things in a humanitarian way we've drilled water wells we've made them available for communities in africa and they were not just available for the saints of god but they were available for any thirsty human being that needed to drink we've sent medicine we've done different things in vietnam and different parts of the world why because i care for humanity i don't just care for you oh you say well we should think about our own we want to put our own first but remember the lord jesus does not just save his own but he saves those in the book of life which are not his own so he cares for others you see if satan can get us so locked in that all we care about is this this group then we'll narrow it down to just this family and then it'll come on down to our family and it keeps getting smaller and smaller and smaller but the love of god is so great it'll take eternity for us to really understand and comprehend how much god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son not the bride the world it is not his will that any should perish but that all should come to repentance so he doesn't just love his family he loved the human race is that right so we don't want to become so narrowed and so focused that all we think about is our church or just our message well everybody else and you know they're not even worth where well god don't agree with you in that view if you can give people a kind word why not give it to them well they don't come to church what difference does that make the lord jesus did not just heal those that were elect the lord jesus did not just come and make a way for those who have salvation that were on the lamb's book of life but also on the book of life i think we need to have his makeup his character and his attitude well hallelujah is that right now let's tap back if we can for just a few minutes before we go a different direction here on this great virtue of the lord god which is to be revealed mainly in the laodicean church age on the attribute of brotherly kindness now this is what's going to be in the body the main virtue of the day now we need of course all seven virtues but this is the one that will be the focus second peter chapter one verse five and beside all beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and divert your knowledge to knowledge temperance to temperance patience to patience godliness oh my to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity which is god himself for these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sin so we're talking about now people that have been forgiven and people that have been purged so you can be forgiven and you can be purged and still miss these virtues right here and a person who thinks well i'm forgiven that's all i need no you're just getting started you're just getting started to come into the economy of god now we notice when prophet deals with this he says actress artists looser then comes philadelphia god in this wesley holiness just shall live by faith said looser sanctification through wesley then come in brotherly kindness through the laodicea and we believe the great message of the second appearing of elijah in the last days shall sweep the land now notice what this is going to be each of us may have an element of these seven virtues that are natural to our human makeup but god does not accept that into the stature of a perfect man well brother donnie i'm pretty patient i i've got you know a little bit of faith and i've got a little bit of godliness that's well and good but these virtues are not our own virtues but they are the virtues of the lord jesus christ himself in the days of paul it was the virtue of christ jesus that was manifesting himself and the bottom part of the pyramid because god is building a house and that house don't look like a cube but it looks like a pyramid so we got the church age the church aids messenger and then we've got a virtue on the other side notice this now oh my and now we put the blood of jesus christ in and that brings the face of jesus christ so the face of jesus christ is not your faith on steroids it's not your faith built up by intellectual something but the virtues are actually the virtues of the lord jesus phil brother god i've got such faith wonderful i appreciate that but there will be times your faith will not be able to do what you need to be done what's this now we put the blood of jesus christ in that brings the face of jesus christ the virtue of jesus christ the knowledge of jesus christ but notice satan will try to bring a carnal impersonation of every one of these virtues why he does not want us to have the face of jesus christ the virtue of jesus christ the knowledge he don't mind you having knowledge he don't care if you memorize the scripture he don't care if you memorize the message and you can quote it and quote it and quote it but what does that knowledge do puffs you up but you see the knowledge of jesus christ will give an answer to the devil when you don't know what to say but the knowledge of jesus christ never makes you arrogant it never makes you puffed up but human knowledge does [Applause] oh my the knowledge of jesus christ the temperance the temperance you say why would the lord jesus need these he become a human being praise god jesus had faith jesus had virtue jesus had knowledge don't the bible tell us in luke 2 52 that jesus grew in wisdom and in stature before both god and men he allowed himself by the act of kenosis to step out of that all-knowing situation and step into humanity in such a degree and say i can do nothing except what my father shows me remember him talking about his second coming and he said even the son don't know when he's coming wow mind-boggling the temperance of jesus christ the patience you say why would he need patience you you me paul peter john [Music] angels ain't done near the trying of his patience that i have and i'm going to go ahead and say it for the rest of you you bunch of sorry outfits y'all have done the same thing jesus needs patience to put up with us we're lazy we're sorry and i love you all y'all know it [Applause] the patience of jesus christ the godliness of jesus christ the brotherly kindness friend every one of these satan will try to bring an impostor of this and you're saying well i'm good i'm good i don't cut my hair don't do this i don't do that praise god i never wear red i i'm oh man i've got this holiness i'm so holy i'm so righteous uh-huh yeah and with yours it'll bring an attitude it'll bring an arrogance and you'll look down that long nose of yours that everybody that don't obey your convictions oh i'll tell you one thing there's people in our church that do this and don't do that and do something those do something else you know what it is that's the kind of so-called godliness satan wants us to have that we become harsh we become judgmental oh my but jesus said blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain apparently they need it i don't know about you i need mercy every day of my life my my you mean jesus christ as a man needed brotherly kindness if you'd had to put up with peter james john bartholomew thaddeus and all the rest of them guys you would have knew knowing why he needed it now let's just update it and say he still needs it today putting up with the rest of us oh my that's exactly right notice in the love of god which is jesus christ he's the head that controls you and your feet is the foundation face amen controlled by the head there you are there is the perfect man of god when he possesses these virtues notice again on page 51 so when you're surrendering your complete being then the holy spirit just pours through you in these verses notice the holy spirit pours through you through these virtues as god speaks to a pastor god speaks to the prophet god speaks to the evangelist the teacher and so on so the holy ghost these are the aspects in our life that god wants to speak through us not our human intelligence not our intellect not our pride not our arrogance these are the avenues that god will speak through us too by the dawning to everybody you come in contact with that he leads you to say something to if god's got anything to say on the earth today guess what he's going to use if god's got a sermon to be preached he's not going to send an angel god will never send an angel with wings on his back to stand here in this pulpit and preach a sermon to you all if you're down if you're weak if you're sick god said i'll get out of the way donnie get out of the way let me take that microphone i'll preach to them that's absolutely forbidden as a matter of fact the prophet of god said when the pastor steps in the pulpit he is the angel of god to you it would be forbidden for god to send a cherub and take my ipad this morning and preach these things to you it's totally forbidden it breaks divine protocol so is god want to fill his people with these things and god threw that protocol of your life loves like jesus forgives like jesus has temperance with your brother your sister your wife your children your husband whatever more that you yourself can say oh i'll tell you one thing boy they aggravate me but i'm gonna love like jesus i'm gonna pray for him help me first lord help me first oh my so when you're surrendering you're complete being then the holy spirit pours through you in these virtues then you're a living tabernacle then people look out and say that's a man full of virtue knowledge believes the word temperance patient godliness got brotherly kindness full of the love of the holy ghost walking around what is it a statue that unbelievers can look at and say there is a christian i'm going to tell you something friend you will never attain anything higher in this life until the body change that for this to be said about you in reality people may call you a rich man i said wow i've arrived i'm in the millionaires club i'm a billionaire i'm a thousand here i'm a penny or i'm whatever i i've arrived well with who we've got in the white house now you better hang on to it because next year you may not be come on they're going to give the irs the authority you know that already to monitor your checking account and your savings they're going to keep an eye on you big brother's watching you but aren't you glad your riches your real ones are laid up in heaven and mr biden don't have access to that account congress and the irs don't have access to that account praise the lord but when a person can look out of sincerity and say these words about you there is a christian nothing higher could be said about you nothing oh but brother donna would that man pray for me that don't mean he's a christian jesus said many will stand before me in that day so i cast out devils in your name i heal the sick in your name and then i will say unto them depart from me you worker of iniquity i never even knew you friends i wonder sometimes if we haven't missed some things we're saying why because we're so deep and we understand so much and now we know this i i i know i know i've been around a lot of those kingdom building preachers around the messaging what i've found is for a lot of their followers the more they know the more arrogant they become and the less friendly they are to everybody else i've been around some of them better so deep and know so much they know so much they won't even speak to you and you want me to believe you've got more of jesus than i do i don't see jesus doing that friends well preached brother donnie notice this in blasphemous names first foundationally is faith second that to your faith virtue to your virtue knowledge from knowledge temperance from temperance patience to almighty patience godliness and from godliness to brotherly kindness brotherly kindness then love being the capstone seven of those things seven church ages seven stars of the seven church ages all of it is tempered by what the holy spirit now that's what it takes to become a servant of christ how many needs more brotherly kindness more faith more virtue oh you're just keeping your hand up good good notice this again he says in paragraph 254 what is purpose to the church then life that was in christ isn't reflecting in you don't you stand still if you haven't got patience notice that the prophet himself didn't did not tell us don't stand still until you're the deepest person in the message you can quote me verbatim you can quote me word for word for word but these are the things he instructed us to persist in don't you stand still oh my if you've got patience virtue all these things and temperance and things and godliness and brotherly kindness all these things that's required of you now let us look in first corinthians chapter 12 if you would verse 24. look at how we are in the body for our comedy parts have no need but god hath tempered the body together look at this greek word mixed with mixed together co-mingle calls several parts to combine into an organic structure which is the body to unite one thing to another so god is liking the spiritual body to our natural body and this way paul is taking it but god has tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to that part which lacked now i hope you understand already that what we just read is an absolute miracle within itself that god actually takes people from different makeups different backgrounds different oh my just everything about us different races different culture different things totally around the world and god tempers them together and they commingle and they could never there's no way that the message of the hour could ever be replicated it could not be replicated by politics the republican party is divided as the democrats and the democrats are divided and the liberals are divided communism is divided socialism is divided but there is not a unity around the world that exists like the spiritual unity of the body of jesus because we're not uniting on political principles there may be democrats sitting here this morning republicans and some of you wouldn't give you a flip of a nickel for either one of them because you don't really care one way or the other but yet you are brothers and sisters in christ jesus [Music] [Applause] notice this in verse 25 that there should be no schism schism the word schism means division or dissension in the body notice now he's not calling this bodies but he uses one term through these whole passages of scripture body singular but the members should have the same care for one another now please listen to me carefully and don't misunderstand me i am not the body of christ you are not the body of christ as an individual but we are members of that body well i don't need to go to church i don't need someone so ah well you see a person like that don't even understand the body at all because they are making themselves the body as a whole well i don't have to go to church why of course you don't have to go to church but if you ever get to holy ghost you'll want to oh sure i don't have to not run around on my wife i don't have to not want to rob banks and smoke cigarettes and do all that sort of thing it's not a case of me not having to i just don't want to do it and it's the same when a person really gets a revelation that coincides with the divine word of god oh i don't have to go to church i don't have to be around nobody else i can stay at home and be just as good a christian well according to your prophet he said you couldn't amen but you see that there would be no schism in the body so god takes all these different members and he tempers them together and makes them function to one divine purpose that's an absolute miracle it's an absolute miracle some of us are so stubborn some of us are hard headed some of us are gentle some of us are tempered one way some are tempted or another it's a miracle for all of us to be sitting in the same building this morning having church together why because in our human makeup we're so different and you'd ask our likes and our dislikes and say how in the world are you all able to get together we've been tempered by the holy ghost notice in verse 26 and whether one member suffered now notice what paul is identifying now he's not calling that member of the body but he's calling it a member of the body so if one member suffer so your brothers your wife tells you look honey i'd like to move that picture on the wall you say okay sure so you get your tools ready you hold it up there your stud finder you run across it you hold that nail up all of a sudden you've got it right back and whenever you do she said you care for t so you hit the wrong nail now look how small my thumbnail is not very big at all pumps no blood does not filter things in my body like my liver and my kidneys does not have any digestive juices in it it does not help as far as my eye color my hair color made out of keratin and all that vitamin k but all of a sudden my entire body is focusing on that little bitty piece of carrot and your heart oh oh why did you ask me if i wanted teeth in oh oh honey i'm so sorry and she comes over oh jesus jesus jesus oh so the entire body is giving attention your whole focus is now on that little nail can't you see what we're supposed to be as a body of jesus christ but what we tend to do we're the only army that's ever been in history that kills our own wounded brother so somebody falls and makes a mistake and does this and that and then ah we don't want nothing to do with a bunch of sorry outfits [Music] you should do it the way you do your son [Music] oh i realize it's risky you see when folks get in sin and they fall on the backside and they get all dirty and nasty and filthy it's risky going to the rescue sometimes i feel like i work for the sewer department of heaven with some of the trash i have to deal with in people's lives but let me tell you one thing i would rather do that i would rather be identified and fulfill the scripture the word of god remember the prophet talking about abraham whenever a lot backslid and god away from god and abraham risked his own life and the lives of his 318 men to go down there and deliver his brother said somebody said to me not long ago why do you go after that fella why do you go after that thing and said god forbid that i would ever get to a place that i would not reach out oh i'll tell you friend i'd love to be able to lead some of those who've backslid away from god and left our church i love to be able to lead some of them back they may smell like marijuana they may smell like alcohol they may smell like whatever more or but if i can lead them to the lord jesus i found out if we can bring them in we can clean them up after we catch them you brothers that fish no you cannot claim that fish while he's still in the lake but if you catch him then you can clean him oh hallelujah may god help us as a body that no matter how vile how wretched that we're not afraid to get our hands dirty [Applause] oh but my we're all so clean we're lily white oh we're just so precious and so wonderful and we've sat down to eat at the table of the king and our hands are clean our spirit is clean we're totally flawless we're just about the next thing to god himself you're a liar [Applause] is it risky yes i have risked my reputation many times by putting my arms around a fallen brother that i knew when i did it there would be self-righteous people that would look at me and say why would brother donny do that because i don't want to see a one parish i don't want to see a one parish i don't want to see a woman but brother donny they smell and they stink oh they do that's the way you and i did when we were in sin oh my but it might not be just one that's never got saved that'll be the last one in it could be a backslider that used to sit right here in this church or used to sit in louisiana somewhere and well come on let's just be honest it takes more grace in our hearts to deal with a backslider than it does a ranked center if we lead rank sinners to the lord and we baptize them all we're all standing up and we're so proud and we make such accolades but who wants to reach someone that's god had a fellowship with god and they're contaminated and they're filthy i will i'll do it even at the risk of you some of you not understand some of my contemporaries not understanding because i want to be like my jesus in every aspect of my life i'll tell you one thing if he would have reached out to those of us that were so clean and so pure and so sanctimonious there wouldn't be none of us even saved today but he picked us up out of the mirey clay he picked us up out of wretchedness and sin and the filth of the world and said child come on home come on hallelujah whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it [Music] listen to this high flips now it goes one member be honored all the members rejoice with it well that's a tough one for some folks oh yeah we turn out of prayer remember sister so it's awesome you just said god help my sister and for many of you is genuine but when you hear about somebody getting honored i've been saved longer than them well this is tough for preachers too because god will call them and raise him up and let him do this and that the other boy preachers if they're not careful they'll go to fighting him ah these big name preachers i've asked a lot of people to please explain to me what that means is that how many letters is in his name big name i only know one big name among us that's the lord jesus christ it ain't my name tim pruitt's name ron spencer's name joel brown's name there's only one big name that's the lord jesus oh the love of god in the body can cry for those who are crying and then when they see a brother or sister that god blesses and uses or even maybe blesses them financially they can like i say praise god praise god amen well i guess i'm also dismissed now can you rejoice if you see other people blessed more financially than you are or do you have a problem my problem is them no actually it's not it's you [Applause] brother reminds me of it every now and then to be honest i don't remember even saying it to him but he says that i told him something years and years ago and he was a young preacher and that was this brother daryl you cannot really be used by god in a great way until you can see one of your brothers use greater than yourself then you're a candidate for god to use you then you realize it's not competitive that's right well i'll tell you one thing there's more folks stream happy valley than any other church in the message i'm not sure that that's a blessing pardon probably the fbi and the irs and only god knows who else well i tell one man i've got more folks following my ministry than so-and-so does you are so carnal you are so carnal thank god for every man of god that's called by the spirit of god i don't care if they reach 5 000 times more than we do i want to do our little parts and let them do their great big parts and when we all get to heaven we will all give praise to our lord jesus christ and say that we were unworthy servants oh so a brother or sister can be set in a high place wow and we have to walk by them and look at them god bless you you pharisy [Applause] i'm talking from my heart's friends oh i know this ain't deep this morning most you don't live deep anyway so that's right where you live can we with all reality if god blesses a man or a woman god blesses somebody to sing and they're so talented and people just oh they so bless and they just clap and clap and clap and clap and clap and reclap and reclap and then whenever you sing they just clap or do you take it out on the people come on brother's fault they got with them better than the other person you see some people who are that way can never acknowledge that maybe god gives someone else a little greater gift than themselves but one of the greatest victories you'll ever achieve is to find that god sets people in the body as it pleases him not them can i have a few more minutes y'all ain't gonna turn further me are you now brother louie don't give me this pasture appreciation i thought about time maybe you should wait till after the service and see if they still appreciate me it might be pastor depreciation so god blesses somebody helps them honors them with a higher office maybe more understanding my goodness i hear some of the message brothers preach on whatever it is i think i just heard that same sermon how come i didn't get that and believe it or not some of them tell me that and that's the greatest marvel of all believe me you think wow really why because god does not give all of it to one human being god does not give all the great understanding of election to one message pastor then everybody in the message rallies around that pastor but god diversifies his gifts and divides them out among the body i'm glad he does it that way it's perfect maybe one have more spiritual light on this or that or the other my and some just so struggle watch this in oneness with god the prophet said by one spirit we're all individually baptized into one body collectively the body of jesus christ and jesus christ living with his spirit in our flesh serving who not jesus christ living in your flesh serving you but jesus christ in your flesh serving the body boy it's a meeting down in louisiana and i'll tell you one thing that last service several weeks ago i asked brother tim brother tim who's preaching the last service because somehow another always gets stuck with a lifestyle so i was hoping maybe i wouldn't so he said why are you iron brother dummy i didn't even ask about the other one i wanted to know about that one him and i'm brother ron we're all together we all got a life out of it oh i went home back to the room of rv where karen i was staying boy i studied for a sermon i'm telling you what i studied and it was going to be man was it going to be a sermon oh i got a sunday morning or before i got up and the lord woke me up before daylight oh why it doesn't matter way but it does that's fine i have no problem with that's fine sir he started dealing with me about some things i thought oh no there was that real good sermon i was gonna preach so when i got up i started putting all that together for those of you there and those of you that streamed it oh i struggled with that sermon i even posted on the ministry chat brothers pray for me this morning i told brother tim before i walked out and said pray for my body i got to bring something i really don't want to bring it obey the lord but i told her brother this week if i ever get up in a convention anywhere else and announce my title going back home the whole building will empty out some of you don't know what i'm talking about but i preached about returning back home coming back down off the mountain and all kinds of battles and all hell breaking loose believe what you want to believe it was prophetic but it wasn't what i wanted to preach i wanted to cap off them meetings oh i had a sermon i told carol said this is what i was going to preach it was going to be this and it was going to be that and it had been a million miles off it would have made everybody so happy and jumping and shouting my lord they never tore the pews down just other services that have been swinging off the chandeliers you think with the final climax of the presence of god but god didn't want that so now what are you going to do you're a preacher you're gifted you're called you want to get up and preach what you want to preach or you want to preach something that's so against you but you do it because he's the boss [Applause] why he knew the body would need it that was what i gonna say in the other sermon lies no it wasn't lies it was the truth it was the scripture it was a message but it was the wrong season what was seasonal was what he wanted a song leader might be the same way god put something on his heart to sing and say we practice that i don't know about that i don't know no i don't do that i might mess up what you're concerned about himself i want people to say i'm a good singer i want people to think i'm a good preacher i want people to think this that what difference does it make what people thinks it's what god thinks that counts oh my verse 27 we'll close now ye are the body of christ and members in particular so depaul is addressing the church remember this isn't one of the most gifted churches in the new testament not another church had as many gifts but they assumed gifts meant depths understanding knowledge just because people are gifted don't mean they have a lick of sense well praise the lord they don't mean they've got to lick a sense it don't mean they have a lick of wisdom i don't understand it myself that's one of the things i'm going to ask him one day why do you give gifts to people that don't even know how to use them i don't know but look at them they were so divided they were cultish this was following that man this group was following that man that group was following another man and they argued and they fussed and they fought and yet they were so gifted they had one man living with his stepmother they had the office bunch of issues that ever was and they had more gifts than all the rest of the bible even mentions of the new testament church and they thought because of the gifts that meant they were so close to god it didn't so they used their gifts so they come to church they love to speak in tongues they would just speak in tongues while the preaching was going on they'd speak in tongues and they're so loud it would drown out the preacher you couldn't hear the preacher but they thought they were so spiritual you imagine they just speak in tongues and just go on and on and on and on and on oh glory to god we had such a service a preacher couldn't even preach it was such a wonderful service why because they were using their gifts for themselves instead of edifying the body whatever god gave you as far as your gift it's not for you it's for the body of christ but you will be tempted i'll warn you ahead of time to use that gift for yourself you see the example i just gave you a preacher a preacher can go and preach with that gift that god's given and he can use that gift to make himself look greater in the eyes of the people or he can use that gift to follow the spirit of god and i found out through decades of experience many times god will have you to preach beneath your capacity beneath what you see and beneath what you understand and then people will criticize you oh he don't know very much he don't this and that and the other but yet you're following the spirit of god and he knows you will and it's like he puts that before you what's he doing he's using you to prove his word to the devil i've got men that are so gifted that if they ever stood up and really opened what i've given them it would profound their congregation that's been setting under them for years and years but what does god do he keeps you right where he's in charge he's the boss [Applause] can we stand oh praise the lord i'm just glad you come to church me too oh my may god help us now ye are the body of christ and members in particular romans 12 4 for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in christ and everyone remembers one of another no revelation from god will ever disassociate you or me from the rest of the body i don't need the body i don't that's contrary to scripture you are members of one another look friends you all think you need me that's only half the picture i need you what good would a gift to preach do in any man's life without people to preach to when the bad case of covet was going on here in our church and we had about 10 or 11 brothers here god help me and god anointed me but his show wasn't the same as saying you're all smiling faces and i can tell you that right now not one of these pews ever jumped up and raised their ends not a one of them ever raised up and shouted not a one of them ever praised god these brothers god bless the heart they double amen they quadrupled every ever every time they could to try to make it easy on the preacher why it ain't the same without you being here why we need one another how many wants to be more like what you've heard today amen lord jesus let's bow our heads together for it lord god we know as long as we're in these old human prisons we're a slave held in captivity through these bodies our make up our natures most of us can take promotion much greater than demotion most of us love to be acknowledged we love to hear a name called lord god help us to realize every gifted singer in this place musician preacher whatever more that gift was not given to them so that people could think oh they're so gifted we need to acknowledge that of course but every gift in this assembly was given for the body i mean oh lord that even with preachers and with singers some lord are given to bless other assemblies so when they go out someone may say however so and so to say have sister so-and-so to sing because their singing is such a blessing to other assemblies maybe for some it's not so they just bless that assembly where they are it doesn't mean they're not called doesn't mean they're not gifted same with preachers samuel musicians lord god help us help each of us to move beyond jealousy and carnality may we move closer and closer to the image of the lord jesus we see the apostles as they were arguing and debating of who was going to be the greatest just days before you're going to be crucified in their fussing of who's going to be the biggest the sons of thunder their mother comes and says i want my two boys to be able to sit in the throne one on the left and one on the right and the rest of the disciples got jealous and angry because of this we know this was all signs that they didn't have the holy ghost yet once they got the holy ghost we don't see any other instance in the bible where such things prevailed carol asked me the other day that i think after they got the holy ghost if they still battled them i said i believe they did they were human beings but the prevalent thing was the holy ghost not their humanity so it wasn't so essential to write about all their failures no doubt peter ward with peter every day of his life no doubt john ward with john and we know that john the beloved disciple john when they didn't receive you in the city the samaritans and john said you want us to call fire down that heaven him and his brethren jesus said you don't even know what spirit you're off no doubt john still had to deal with an element of john after he got the holy ghost louie's got to deal with an element of louie harry and don ian all the rest of us and this is why you give us these great manifestations of your own nature in a seven-fold way of these virtues to live out of us so when our patience runs thin the patience of jesus christ can kick in when our godliness may run short the godliness of jesus christ our brotherly kindness may run short with a brother or a sister but when ours runs thin yours is an inexhaustible fountain help us today lord jesus not only those in this visible audience but those that have streamed today may you minister to every hungry heart lord we believe you started your church the way you wanted it and you're going to end it the way you started it this is the type of lives the alpha bride lived when they were buried in the dirt of denominationalism then the omega bride must be living out the same life with the same nature with the same virtues that the alpha bride had for she was alpha now she is omega we see them lord as they would tack them to crosses they would wrap them in sheepskins and animal skins and poor pitch on their bodies and set them on fire and they would sing songs and the heathens the romans would say listen they sing look at how they die yet the neros would scream like a pig when they were being killed the romans died like cowards what was it that helped those christians it was your life in them so they could pray for those who crucified them as nero would walk through his garden at night and those human torches would burn our brothers and sisters flesh would fall off of their bodies and melt as it were them screaming in pain and torture but they did not recant because it was the patience of jesus christ the faith of jesus christ well today lord we're not being torched we're not being hunted down but we're fighting lord never demon out of hell that's been let loose against us sickness disease pestilence oppression sadness sorrow we can feel it lord god we need you to live through us in the omega cycle the way you live through your first bride in the alpha cycle hallelujah yes we want to heal the sick as you did yes we want to lay hands on them but we also want to have this as you did that you could hang there on the cross and say father forgive them for they know not what they do hallelujah so it's not a blinded eye it was not a crippled leg the last work on the cross it was pardoning the hard-hearted the uncaring and reaching out to a man that said remember me and you said today thou shalt be with me in paradise help us lord jesus may we not give up on our children maybe not give up on our loved ones maybe not give up on those lord have pulled away lord god bring them back for that last one lord jesus could be a woman you're today she's out there in the world went back to the slop of the world yet her name is on that book well if she sees one of our sisters well our sisters be shamed to be identified with her she got a tattoo on her left arm a tattoo on her neck a tattoo on her right arm lord god help us hallelujah that we can be like you that that last one that last work of miraculous power might be reaching out to a thief on a cross we don't know who it'll be lord but may we be ready may we not preach so that we can be honored may we not even preach sermon titles in certain subjects because that's our favorite the lord god help me as a preacher and i'll always follow your spirit you know how much i dislike preaching sermons like today you know how it breaks my heart the last service i shared i sat back there in the office with my head in my hands carol opened the door and walked in and said don't you feel bad it's what we needed any man of god you know lord how it goes against us but our gift is not for us it's not for fame or fortune it's to minister to your people i know sometimes i may make them angry i don't mean to i don't want to but if i've got to swallow them a little bit and i've got to shake them they'll appreciate it lord after a while help us lord jesus thank you lord god how many of you would raise your hand and say to the lord lord use me whatever i can do lord maybe it's give a person a little money lord maybe it's send somebody a text to lift them up maybe it's to pray for brother donnie brother daryl these ministers maybe it's to pray for the song leaders lord nobody may never know it what can i do lord that'll minister to this body here this local assembly hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah blessed jesus may you anoint us father may we have such a baptism of love today through this covert thing i've seen this body come together like never before i've seen them reach out to one another and help one another i thank you for that lord so it proved to us once again that when we get in stress and great difficulty that we run to one another's needs even though humanly we may not like each other's makeup or this or that but that don't matter hallelujah we're brothers we're sisters in the economy of god oh jesus will you send a fresh baptism of the holy ghost around the world baptize us preachers afresh lord oh we don't agree on this idea and maybe that idea but lord god help us to realize through difficulty really isn't these minor ideas that's what makes us family it's because we have the same father the word worship you today jesus we worship you jesus can we take just a few minutes now how many feels like you need just a fresh baptism of the holy ghost in your life not for signs and wonders but for love brotherly kindness godliness patience virtue remember jesus come down off of that mount of transfiguration and in the valley he was met by a man who had a boy possessed of an evil spirit one thing after another hit him moses come down from the mount of god and he was met by people and naked worshiping idols oh it's easy when we're under his anointing but it's when we walk out of these doors to take what we're hearing and let it live out of us when there is no anointing present but remember you are anointed to be bride that does not mean when you feel it i'm just as anointed to pray for the sick when you call me in the morning at 1 30. as i am when i'm standing right here under the anointing and many of you know you've called me at one o'clock two o'clock three o'clock four o'clock whatever it is in the morning for prayer and now i'm awakened out of a dead sleep and the spirit of god will come on the other end of the phone and heal your body and bring deliverance why i'm anointed to pray for the sick i'm anointed to live right and i'm not only anointed to live right but as a bride you're anointed to live right whether you feel it or whether you don't you're anointed to be bright you're anointed to manifest jesus christ to this last age that we live in

thing can we do to make our church a better place what can i do lord as a member not what can i get but what can i do what can i do lord it's easy for me to sit on the seat of criticism and criticize this and criticize that but lord what could i do that would make our church a better place praise god what can i do jesus what can i do as the pastor lord help me help me that i'll give my all my use is gone much of my strength i'll never regain it but may i give what i have left hallelujah may every man woman boy and girl those that are streaming today maybe brother jason watkins some of his
