[13:11] just a second to want to uh talk to the
[13:14] parents this morning uh in particular
[13:16] something just uh speaking with the
[13:18] brother and sister just a moment ago and
[13:20] it just refreshed my Zeal and um uh the
[13:25] the the prayers even that I have for
[13:27] parents who are who have children who
[13:30] are wward um many some are bound by
[13:33] drugs alcohol promiscuity all of these
[13:37] things be encouraged just a few weeks
[13:40] ago I was in in South Carolina and a
[13:43] brother gave a testimony young guy in
[13:45] his 30s he spoke about a life on the
[13:48] street and being bound by
[13:50] drugs and when I was speaking to his mom
[13:52] later I know her and and the dad and is
[13:55] a minister of the Gospel I preached for
[13:56] him uh down through the years but uh um
[13:59] he was out on the street for 19 years 19
[14:04] years Bound by a demon of drugs and
[14:08] sometimes um you know we we may not
[14:11] experience and go through what others
[14:13] are going through but a devil is a devil
[14:17] is a devil and we are the people of God
[14:20] are we not and the Bible tells us in the
[14:22] Book of Romans that blindness in part
[14:24] has happened it's a mystery Paul says
[14:26] blindness in part has happened to to to
[14:29] the
[14:30] Jews until the fullness of the Gentiles
[14:33] become come in and all the turmoil and
[14:35] things that are going on in that land
[14:36] today are for my benefit for your
[14:39] benefit in order that we can receive the
[14:41] fullness of the power of this gospel
[14:43] we've been United to Joseph and it's
[14:45] about our time to be taken
[14:49] out of the room in order that he can
[14:52] reveal himself to his Brethren so let's
[14:55] do all that we can if you know of a of a
[14:57] dad a mom that's going through something
[14:59] with their child don't shy away from
[15:01] them I know it may be uncomfortable to
[15:03] talk about it sometimes but these are
[15:05] things that God has given us the power
[15:07] to stand against and we are a body we
[15:10] are to be United together so if you know
[15:12] a mom a dad that's going through
[15:13] something you go and put an arm around
[15:15] them and you go pray with them in their
[15:18] situation that God will bring them their
[15:20] their child out of that
[15:22] condition we are the people of the
[15:24] chosen We Are The Chosen generation
[15:26] that's amen let us pray Heavenly Father
[15:29] we give you
[15:30] honor we give you glory we give you
[15:33] praise and these names on these pieces
[15:37] of paper the the the testimonies and
[15:39] things that we've heard already this
[15:40] morning of what you've done Lord we
[15:43] stand firm in who we are sure sometimes
[15:45] we get discouraged sure sometimes we get
[15:47] weighted down with the with the busyness
[15:50] and the the craziness and the pressures
[15:52] of this age in which we live but father
[15:55] you have anointed us to stand you've put
[15:57] a word within us
[16:00] that can speak to a storm just as you
[16:03] did that day on the sea when you said
[16:05] peace be still those words have already
[16:08] been spoken and we in turn have to take
[16:11] those very same words upon our lips and
[16:14] speak to storms and maybe sometimes it's
[16:16] a storm in someone else's life may we
[16:19] speak those words over them Father we
[16:21] thank you for what you're going to do in
[16:22] this service today everything may it be
[16:25] For Your Glory may it be for your
[16:27] benefit may it be for the betterment of
[16:29] the kingdom may it be for the broadening
[16:31] of our territories and our boundaries
[16:33] father so may we stand in our position
[16:35] as the words of the song say Lord stand
[16:38] in our position and watch the miraculous

[16:46] words through our faith that you've
[16:48] given to us be glorified in this service

[17:00] hanging over the people today May the
[17:02] word as it comes forth May the worship

[52:22] see the scripture I I've read
[52:24] Lord father we just are asking that you
[52:27] would just come down take them Lord use
[52:32] them Father may you help me to expound
[52:35] Lord father I trust in you I believe in
[52:38] you and Lord I ask these things in Jesus
[52:42] name amen you may be
[52:48] seated
[52:53] yeah I brought a prop
[53:06] this is a
[53:07] chair if you have any questions it is a
[53:12] chair I went to Walmart and I was
[53:14] looking
[53:17] for yeah this was quality compared to
[53:22] what I what I thought I would find there
[53:24] this is a a chair and and the reason I I
[53:26] brought a chair was because a lot of you
[53:31] see this just as a
[53:35] chair right it's just a chair now it's a
[53:38] folding chair yeah that doesn't make a
[53:41] difference it's a folding
[53:43] chair and for most of you you just think
[53:49] chair but for those of us of a larger
[53:52] statue that's right
[53:56] just
[53:58] s for those of us who have a little bit
[54:00] more
[54:05] flesh we look at that
[54:09] chair and first thing we do is touch the
[54:13] chair lean on the chair a little
[54:17] bit you little people don't understand
[54:20] Little People come on
[54:23] now but for a big guy that's not just a
[54:27] chair that's right that could be a death
[54:32] trap right yeah yes sir you little
[54:37] people just run up and plop yourself
[54:41] right
[54:46] down but when I look at
[54:51] that I think I don't know
[54:53] brother is that going to hold me
[54:59] and if I sit in that
[55:03] chair is there going to be
[55:06] laughter shortly
[55:12] thereafter
[55:15] now I was listening to a
[55:18] podcast um and I I you know I do that I
[55:23] drive a lot
[55:24] so uh and there was a guy on there I
[55:27] think his name is John rich or something
[55:30] he's a he write he used to write country
[55:32] music and now he's kind of got off and
[55:35] and uh and he got to to
[55:38] talking and he he he's give his life to
[55:41] Christ and he's pushed all that stuff
[55:44] away and and all that good stuff it
[55:46] wasn't his podcast it was Jordan
[55:48] Peterson but anyway he
[55:50] said something that struck me and I
[55:53] couldn't get a I already had something
[55:54] planned out this week but I couldn't get
[55:56] away from this he said he said the
[55:59] difference
[56:01] between
[56:03] believing and faith is like a
[56:08] chair
[56:10] okay and I got to thinking that that's
[56:14] true for a big guy you little people
[56:16] don't understand but for a big
[56:21] guy that chair says a lot it is a chair
[56:27] yeah
[56:31] right but if I sit in that chair it's
[56:34] going to take some Faith right
[56:37] amen I'm putting my faith in that chair
[56:43] yes now this one seems to be a little
[56:46] bit sturdier than most I've
[56:50] seen But faith in that chair so let's
[56:55] say I I'm I've been walking standing for
[56:59] hours
[57:02] hours and I need
[57:05] rest come
[57:07] on I need some
[57:12] relaxation I have to put my faith in
[57:14] that
[57:18] chair
[57:20] so I'm going to take this tent off it's
[57:24] a little hot
[57:29] so in our Christian
[57:32] walk as busy as we are and as much as we
[57:36] go in all the things and the pressures
[57:38] of life don't don't expect it to get
[57:41] deep it's going to be real simple but I
[57:42] I hope it'll help
[57:44] you in everything that we
[57:48] do we say we trust Jesus
[57:53] Christ yes sir
[57:56] now Jesus Christ is never going to
[57:59] fail never big or small he catches them
[58:02] all he
[58:05] got
[58:08] but it's us who comes on the side of of
[58:11] failing that's right sometimes we want
[58:14] to go up to him
[58:15] and just feel it out a little bit come
[58:19] on come
[58:21] on we we're not real
[58:23] confident that we can fully rest in him
[58:26] maybe we'll
[58:28] just take the
[58:31] edge and sit real still cuz I've sit in
[58:34] some
[58:35] chairs that I've been very nervous
[58:39] about and you won't catch me doing any
[58:41] sudden
[58:42] movements
[58:47] right right that's right and sometimes
[58:50] that's that's our Christian walk
[58:52] sometimes we we we want to say we trust
[58:54] in Jesus Christ and and we got our all
[58:56] and all and everything we
[58:59] are good is in his
[59:03] hands but there better not be any sudden
[59:09] movements there better not be any hard
[59:19] problems
[59:20] faith is being able to
[59:23] rest that's what I talk about is today
[59:26] Lord willingness is rest yes rest really
[59:30] putting it down really being able to
[59:34] sit in your
[59:37] faith that's good in spite of the hard
[59:41] problems in spite of the hard things in
[59:44] spite of of the busyness of
[59:49] life we need to be able to rest in Jesus
[59:53] Christ completely
[59:58] trust the whole nominal world has
[1:00:03] belief right they
[1:00:23] believe brother brandham says in in God
[1:00:26] his people it says there's a fountain
[1:00:28] open freely flowing flowing freely
[1:00:31] everywhere just drink until you just
[1:00:33] can't drink no more the
[1:00:35] tree if it just drink to what it was
[1:00:38] allotted allotment why it would just
[1:00:41] always still in the drought so he's he's
[1:00:44] saying if the tree just took in exactly
[1:00:47] what it
[1:00:48] needed it would be in drought can't grow
[1:00:51] that
[1:00:54] way that that's the matter that's what's
[1:00:57] the matter with Christians they don't
[1:00:58] drink enough you want to drink till you
[1:01:00] just spread out and let somebody else
[1:01:02] see it let somebody else see
[1:01:05] it if you're not staying in the word if
[1:01:07] you're not fully invested in what Jesus
[1:01:10] Christ has done for you right right then
[1:01:13] you're just going to do enough yeah just
[1:01:16] come to
[1:01:17] church on and let other Christians know
[1:01:21] that you're a
[1:01:23] Christian you're just going to have
[1:01:25] enough but if you have faith in Jesus
[1:01:27] Christ it's the best thing ever happened
[1:01:30] to you
[1:01:32] right and you want to share that you
[1:01:34] want to let it
[1:01:35] [Music]
[1:01:37] go but if you're lacking in
[1:01:41] faith yesterday I went and to this
[1:01:43] little farmers market and got Peaches I
[1:01:46] drove my kids crazy man you got to try
[1:01:48] these

[1:01:51] are good peaches it's something good
[1:01:53] that I had that I wanted to share
[1:01:57] it was an experience that I had that I
[1:01:59] wanted them to
[1:02:01] have and that's the way Jesus Christ
[1:02:03] wants us to be he he he wants us to to
[1:02:05] say hey best thing ever happened to me

[1:02:14] me oh so let him

[1:06:08] give him our our our lot he we've cast
[1:06:10] our Lots with him right
[1:06:16] yes and then we have worry in our lives
[1:06:18] oh
[1:06:20] yeah is that commitment
[1:06:24] no everybody does it it's it's part of
[1:06:28] human nature everybody does it we all
[1:06:30] have that worry we hear a report from a
[1:06:33] doctor we hear you know we we we got to
[1:06:35] go to school take a test we ain't
[1:06:40] studied now I'm not saying you don't
[1:06:42] have to do your part yeah I'm not saying
[1:06:45] that you just well my path is up to you
[1:06:48] Lord you're going to be a
[1:06:53] bum it is
[1:06:56] but a Christian is not
[1:06:58] [Applause]
[1:06:59] lazy and a Christian
[1:07:02] wants to do everything that he
[1:07:05] can
[1:07:08] amen you know I've noticed here lately
[1:07:11] there is so many sign
[1:07:14] holders have you noticed that they're
[1:07:18] all holding
[1:07:22] signs
[1:07:24] homeless lost my job lost my
[1:07:27] car and they look like well aable bodied
[1:07:30] people
[1:07:32] right and it drives me
[1:07:36] crazy so you want me to go to
[1:07:40] work so I could roll down my window and
[1:07:43] give you that money now there's a
[1:07:46] different don't don't get me wrong I
[1:07:49] understand there's people that are in
[1:07:50] need and there are people that that need
[1:07:53] help I was one of those I I was never
[1:07:55] homeless but I needed help I needed that
[1:07:57] stuff but standing on the side of a road
[1:07:59] with a sign is not helping yourself
[1:08:02] right
[1:08:03] right you're not doing anything to to
[1:08:06] move yourself forward that's right good
[1:08:10] point
[1:08:12] true so some of you what a mean
[1:08:18] man I know how hard I
[1:08:23] work and maybe it is sometimes I think
[1:08:26] it's harder work for them to stand out
[1:08:27] there for 12 hours a day in 90° heat
[1:08:30] than it would be to go to an air
[1:08:32] conditioned McDonald's and get a job
[1:08:35] but yeah but people are like that that
[1:08:39] that's their
[1:08:40] mentality and they have totally
[1:08:42] committed to
[1:08:43] that
[1:08:45] right they have totally they don't
[1:08:47] there's no
[1:08:48] guarantee that somebody's going to come
[1:08:50] by and hand them something yeah
[1:08:54] right I saw one yesterday she was
[1:08:59] kneeling lady what are you
[1:09:04] doing they're committed to that their
[1:09:07] next meal depends on
[1:09:10] somebody rolling down their window and
[1:09:13] handing them two
[1:09:14] bucks and I'm sorry $2 ain't going to
[1:09:17] get you
[1:09:18] nothing right that's what they're
[1:09:21] committed
[1:09:22] to I'd rather be committed to Jesus
[1:09:24] Christ
[1:09:26] yeah cuz I know where he's going to take
[1:09:28] me and it's not always easy it's not
[1:09:30] always
[1:09:39] riy now we're going to take this this
[1:09:43] theme of rest go a little few different
[1:09:46] different places we'll see where the
[1:09:47] Lord lands it but Genesis 8 6 and 12 6-
[1:09:53] 12
[1:09:56] and it came to pass at the end of 40
[1:09:58] days that Noah opened up the window of
[1:09:59] the Ark which he had made and he sent
[1:10:02] forth a raven which went forth to and
[1:10:06] fro until the waters were dried up from
[1:10:08] the earth also he sent forth a dove from
[1:10:12] him to see if the waters were Abad from
[1:10:15] the face of the
[1:10:17] ground but the dove found no
[1:10:22] rest for the so of her foot
[1:10:26] and she returned unto him into the ark
[1:10:28] for the waters were on the face of the
[1:10:30] whole earth and he put forth his hand
[1:10:32] and took her and pulled her into the
[1:10:35] into him unto him into the ark so this
[1:10:38] this this is a good example of of of
[1:10:41] listless people people just floating
[1:10:44] here and there they'll find some
[1:10:46] satisfaction and and when you were out
[1:10:48] in the world right maybe the bottle was
[1:10:51] your satisfaction that was where you
[1:10:53] rested that's where you took care of
[1:10:55] your problems
[1:10:59] right maybe it was
[1:11:04] drugs maybe it was the opposite sex
[1:11:07] maybe it was just the attention of the
[1:11:09] opposite
[1:11:11] sex that's how people felt
[1:11:14] good that's where they could rest that's
[1:11:17] where they found some satisfaction come
[1:11:20] on
[1:11:22] now but anybody who's lived that life
[1:11:25] lifestyle knows that's not really rest
[1:11:27] that's right yes sir that's just a place
[1:11:30] to light for just a
[1:11:33] second brother R takes this and he says
[1:11:36] the raven could from jump from dead body
[1:11:38] to dead body right right anything that
[1:11:41] was floating it could and and and those
[1:11:43] dead
[1:11:44] things the raven could find rest dead
[1:11:48] sure
[1:11:49] why because he was S sim uh uh where's
[1:11:54] my VOC
[1:11:55] vocabulary he
[1:11:57] was
[1:11:59] familiar with dead things because he was
[1:12:03] a dead thing
[1:12:06] yeah we go from place to place it it it
[1:12:10] might be there might be people in this
[1:12:12] church right now that that it's
[1:12:15] money it's job their job it's their
[1:12:18] that's where they find rest that's their
[1:12:20] happy
[1:12:22] place and I'm not saying there's
[1:12:24] anything wrong with having a job or or
[1:12:26] or having Recreation and and and and
[1:12:29] those kind of things but if that's what
[1:12:31] you're resting in if that's where your
[1:12:34] stop
[1:12:36] is it's all going to fade
[1:12:39] away how much can you really rest on
[1:12:42] something
[1:12:44] temporal
[1:12:47] temporary
[1:12:50] right that chair if we were to keep it
[1:12:53] around
[1:12:57] we've all seen them well maybe you
[1:12:58] haven't noticed them but I've noticed
[1:13:01] them where they're kind of the legs are
[1:13:04] kind of tweaked One Direction or the
[1:13:06] other you can still barely get them
[1:13:11] open here brother John have a chair
[1:13:20] no there's no real rest in that
[1:13:23] right right how could I be comfortable
[1:13:26] I've seen those little folding card
[1:13:28] table chairs they don't even have metal
[1:13:30] in the the front or the back they're
[1:13:32] just like
[1:13:36] cardboard it's hard for me to commit to
[1:13:38] one of
[1:13:41] those it's hard for me to rest in one of
[1:13:45] those and I really if I'm feeling lucky
[1:13:49] we ease into
[1:13:53] it and we find that that that the
[1:13:57] Christian walk what the devil wants us
[1:13:59] to
[1:14:00] do is just take a
[1:14:03] substitute just take something you can
[1:14:05] ease into it cuz we're
[1:14:08] Christians right we're
[1:14:11] Christians he knows he's not going to
[1:14:13] give us some broken down old piece of
[1:14:16] junk right right he just might bend the
[1:14:19] legs just a little bit and see if you'll
[1:14:22] commit oh wow
[1:14:25] amen you'll see if you'll commit to it
[1:14:28] that's good and once you commit to it
[1:14:30] then you're
[1:14:32] committed that's when you fall that's
[1:14:35] when it
[1:14:36] breaks
[1:14:38] now while we're right here I want to say
[1:14:40] one thing and I might have said it
[1:14:42] already but the difference between my
[1:14:45] comfort level and say brother Noah's
[1:14:48] Comfort
[1:14:49] level in that
[1:14:52] chair is flesh right right right right
[1:14:58] it's true I got a little bit more I got
[1:15:02] a lot more fleshing brother
[1:15:04] Noah say it right uhhuh it right sir so
[1:15:09] his anxiety is not going to be near what
[1:15:11] mine
[1:15:12] is when he sits in that
[1:15:17] chair so the more
[1:15:19] flesh oh yeah yes that you have on you
[1:15:24] the more you contribute to that flesh
[1:15:28] right the more that you feed the flesh
[1:15:32] come
[1:15:33] [Applause]
[1:15:35] on the more anxious you have to
[1:15:38] be about that chair that's good about
[1:15:42] that
[1:15:50] rest
[1:15:52] so as we're going through life and say
[1:15:55] we're committed to Christ the devil
[1:15:57] wants to
[1:15:58] put more of your flesh in view yes he he
[1:16:03] wants to
[1:16:04] amplify he wants you to gain some some
[1:16:07] unspiritual
[1:16:09] pounds
[1:16:10] unspiritual he wants you to be able to
[1:16:12] sit in church through a whole service
[1:16:15] and re-watch a
[1:16:18] movie right come on he wants you to be
[1:16:21] able to sit in
[1:16:23] church and count your bills come on now
[1:16:26] over and over and over again yeah
[1:16:30] yeah commitment
[1:16:33] sure all these things that we have
[1:16:36] hanging off of us all these things that
[1:16:38] we've got holding on to us
[1:16:41] right brother BR says we should be
[1:16:46] unpacking and if we're fully committed
[1:16:49] we still have to I don't want you to
[1:16:51] stop working we still have to have a job
[1:16:54] we still have to to to go to the grocery
[1:16:57] store we still have to maintain our
[1:17:00] house and so on and so forth and all
[1:17:01] those
[1:17:05] things I have
[1:17:07] never been busier in my life right than
[1:17:11] I am right
[1:17:12] now
[1:17:13] amen I know retired people yeah that are
[1:17:19] more busy now than they've ever been
[1:17:22] that's a TR that's a it's an epidemic
[1:17:27] it's something trying it's the devil's
[1:17:29] trick to get us weigh down and and so
[1:17:31] worried and so stressed out and so
[1:17:34] concerned that's
[1:17:38] right so we can't
[1:17:43] rest we can't just sit
[1:17:47] in and trust God trust God yes sir
[1:17:52] right yeah cuz for a while while as
[1:17:56] things and I'm just talking me
[1:17:58] personally for a while as things start
[1:18:01] piling on me Lord you got
[1:18:04] this you got that one
[1:18:08] too you got you got that one too don't
[1:18:10] you right right and as we go along we
[1:18:14] think God's going to get overwhelmed
[1:18:15] with our problems we think God's going
[1:18:18] to get overwhelmed with how we're going
[1:18:19] to pay the bills or or how we're going
[1:18:21] to fix this or how we're going to fix
[1:18:23] that that's right God's not going to get
[1:18:27] overwhelmed he's not going to get
[1:18:29] worried about
[1:18:30] it this the message is still the same
[1:18:33] commit commit rest rest that's good
[1:18:38] that's
[1:18:40] good nothing
[1:18:42] changes with
[1:18:46] God right I I don't know if you heard
[1:18:49] this scripture not Jesus Christ the same
[1:18:52] yesterday today I don't know if you
[1:18:54] heard that that
[1:18:56] one he's the same that's
[1:19:00] right so where does doubt and worry and
[1:19:03] and frustration and stress come from
[1:19:05] come on good it's the other guy that's
[1:19:10] right he's consistent too don't get me
[1:19:15] wrong it's how we respond to
[1:19:19] that brother John you haven't had hard
[1:19:22] problems well you don't know
[1:19:27] I got four
[1:19:28] teenagers tell
[1:19:32] me
[1:19:38] mm the dove found no
[1:19:42] rest wasn't comfortable brother and
[1:19:45] sisters we should not be
[1:19:47] comfortable y That's Right bringing
[1:19:49] certain things into our house
[1:19:52] right good
[1:19:55] that we should not be
[1:19:58] comfortable listening to certain kinds
[1:20:00] of music
[1:20:03] right those
[1:20:06] things play in our head when we sit in
[1:20:12] church but John how do you know I don't
[1:20:18] know but when we're trying to get closer
[1:20:21] to God and trying to have that faith and
[1:20:23] trying to get established in Christ and
[1:20:26] really have
[1:20:28] that that uh testimony
[1:20:32] right the devil wants to do everything
[1:20:35] he possibly can right to get you from
[1:20:39] missing this time with him that's
[1:20:42] right this time with
[1:20:45] him brothers and sisters with like
[1:20:47] Precious Faith yes sir joining
[1:20:51] together
[1:20:52] right pulling together
[1:20:55] working
[1:20:57] together he wants to get you distracted
[1:20:59] from this time where God feeds you like
[1:21:03] this you still need your personal time
[1:21:06] and we know it's easy to get distracted
[1:21:08] with when we're down on our knees or
[1:21:10] whatever more when we're praying or
[1:21:12] reading or whatever but this time I
[1:21:14] found this is when I have to catch my
[1:21:17] mind from going other
[1:21:21] places sure catch my mind from working
[1:21:25] on Monday and it's
[1:21:28] Sunday that's true I bankrupt stairs if
[1:21:33] I if I charg them for all the time I
[1:21:36] spent working up here do you understand
[1:21:39] what I'm
[1:21:41] saying but that's what the devil wants
[1:21:43] to do is he wants to get us so focused
[1:21:45] on everything else that we have to do
[1:21:47] that we have no rest can't sleep at
[1:21:51] night brother tossing in turn
[1:21:54] [Music]
[1:21:58] we have no
[1:22:03] rest because we're human we got flesh
[1:22:10] yeah it's hard for us to
[1:22:12] commit because we got this
[1:22:15] flesh we're never going to get rid of
[1:22:17] the flesh brothers and sisters we're not
[1:22:18] is the only time we're ever going to get
[1:22:20] rid of that is in a
[1:22:22] Rapture right that's that's that's when
[1:22:25] we are finally going to be free of this
[1:22:27] but our job is
[1:22:30] to exercise
[1:22:32] spiritually keep these things in
[1:22:37] check cuz let me tell you in the natural
[1:22:41] once you let it go this
[1:22:44] far
[1:22:46] right right you go to run oh my knees oh
[1:22:50] my back right yes sir I'm just being
[1:22:55] honest with
[1:22:57] you and that's the same thing with your
[1:23:00] flesh
[1:23:03] spiritually do you think that I woke up
[1:23:06] one morning and I was 300
[1:23:09] lb ah it didn't happen like that brother
[1:23:13] right one Twinkie at a time
[1:23:16] baby how on
[1:23:22] now right it don't happen all of a
[1:23:26] sudden just like it don't come off all
[1:23:28] of a
[1:23:30] sudden
[1:23:34] that's and so the devil wants to put
[1:23:37] little things on you just a sprinkle
[1:23:39] here and a Sprinkle there and a Sprinkle
[1:23:43] there and what I found in in the natural
[1:23:46] is the reason I'm this
[1:23:49] big is because when I would
[1:23:53] dieet comes on like with a Vengeance and
[1:23:57] brings 10 more pounds of its
[1:23:59] friend that's
[1:24:02] right I had a little back when I first
[1:24:05] got
[1:24:06] married I was smaller then come on
[1:24:08] Brother come on come
[1:24:10] on and I I thought I was doing all right
[1:24:14] and I had a little doctor about this big
[1:24:17] around yeah and he sat across from
[1:24:21] me and he said Mr hornak
[1:24:25] do you know you're obese stage two I was
[1:24:28] 240 lbs oh for the
[1:24:34] day oh for the day to be
[1:24:40] 240 and this
[1:24:43] guy might have want weighed
[1:24:47] 10
[1:24:50] 60 a little bit taller to me
[1:24:55] and he said your BMI should be about
[1:24:59] 171
[1:25:05] lbs and I looked at him and I said
[1:25:13] okay
[1:25:17] ridiculous that was ridiculous I weighed
[1:25:20] that in high
[1:25:23] school before before I worked and put on
[1:25:34] muscle
[1:25:36] so it just makes you wonder that's the
[1:25:39] way the world the SEI is my
[1:25:46] goodness why aren't
[1:25:49] you in better shape right come on
[1:25:55] why don't you have these things under
[1:25:58] control
[1:26:01] yeah that's not just the world that's
[1:26:03] you so true that's you right that weighs
[1:26:07] on
[1:26:12] yous oh my goodness I guess I'm going to
[1:26:15] fall over next
[1:26:17] week that's what they want to put on
[1:26:20] you
[1:26:23] spiritually your
[1:26:24] mind goes in places it should not go
[1:26:29] because you've committed to Christ and
[1:26:31] you make mistakes and you have this
[1:26:33] flesh
[1:26:36] right and the devil
[1:26:39] says why aren't you further
[1:26:42] along amen I thought you committed devil
[1:26:47] yes
[1:26:49] sir they want to talk to you about how
[1:26:52] out of shape he wants to talk to about
[1:26:53] how out of shape you
[1:26:56] are we all have those problems there's
[1:27:00] not anybody from the preacher the pastor
[1:27:04] I'm sure he'd tell you the same things
[1:27:06] that those mind battles don't go on
[1:27:08] that's right don't think you're alone
[1:27:12] right but what his whole goal and his
[1:27:15] whole focus in getting you in that
[1:27:18] mindset is to get you to uncommit to
[1:27:21] that rest that rest exactly he don't
[1:27:26] want you to rest he wants you to worry
[1:27:28] and stress and get out of the chair and
[1:27:30] well Jesus you
[1:27:32] ain't do nothing for me come
[1:27:35] on there's an epidemic in the young
[1:27:38] people in this church right now and I'm
[1:27:39] going just going to call it
[1:27:45] out God and I aren't
[1:27:48] [Music]
[1:27:50] talking what
[1:27:55] there's young people in this church that
[1:27:57] got in their mind and maybe it's some of
[1:27:59] these older people too that God is not
[1:28:01] talking to them because they haven't
[1:28:03] heard it
[1:28:05] fresh because they don't it's not the
[1:28:08] way they usually hear it come
[1:28:10] on that spiritual immaturity come
[1:28:16] on right rebuke that devil amen you
[1:28:20] rebuke that devil
[1:28:25] he's talking to you now that's
[1:28:28] [Applause]
[1:28:34] right he wants
[1:28:38] you to get that mindset yeah yes he does
[1:28:43] what you don't hear from God and he
[1:28:46] don't hear from you
[1:28:48] oh that's the
[1:28:51] Lord why it breaks that
[1:28:55] relationship it hinders that
[1:28:58] rest all your life you've grown up and
[1:29:01] you've heard about Jesus Christ and how
[1:29:04] he holds you and keeps you
[1:29:09] right yes sir and at The Whisper of his

[1:32:02] resolution God I'm resting in your
[1:32:05] resolution okay
[1:32:10] good now let's see how much you're
[1:32:16] resting rest is a complete
[1:32:20] stop when I rest man I want I want to
[1:32:23] sit down and I just want
[1:32:26] to I don't know puddle I don't know if
[1:32:29] that's a word or expression I just want
[1:32:31] to just be there complete rest that's
[1:32:36] what God has for us uhuh a complete rest
[1:32:42] yes I meant to put at the top of my
[1:32:44] notes what time I
[1:32:46] started because I always
[1:32:49] forget in some Churches you say that and
[1:32:52] you go
[1:33:03] we just we just say it was almost almost
[1:33:07] an hour so we're going to close up here
[1:33:08] I got way way too
[1:33:10] [Music]
[1:33:13] much come
[1:33:15] on let's look at uh so we looked at the
[1:33:19] Dove and and and it just wanted to
[1:33:22] settle it says it was looking for place
[1:33:24] to settle now let's go down to
[1:33:27] uh
[1:33:29] Ruth
[1:33:32] 1 nine and
[1:33:45] 10 this is Naomi speaking said the Lord
[1:33:48] grant you that you may find rest each of
[1:33:52] you in in the house of her
[1:33:54] husband then she kissed them and they
[1:33:57] lifted up their voice and
[1:33:59] wept and they said unto her surely we
[1:34:03] will return with thee unto thy people
[1:34:09] now this word rest is the
[1:34:14] feminine and it it says specifically
[1:34:17] matrimonial so she's telling orpa and
[1:34:22] Ruth go from here here find rest go find
[1:34:26] a
[1:34:27] husband go find a
[1:34:31] rest in your house with a
[1:34:38] husband and we know that they wept
[1:34:41] bitterly and they they said no we'll go
[1:34:44] with you but there was one that wasn't
[1:34:46] committed to that statement
[1:34:52] right there was one that just said you
[1:34:54] know
[1:34:56] what probably be okay if I went back to
[1:35:01] my
[1:35:01] people there were
[1:35:04] mobites found a husband and
[1:35:06] just that was my
[1:35:11] life yeah
[1:35:25] so in the
[1:35:28] feminine I don't know if too many girls
[1:35:30] that don't want to get married there
[1:35:32] might be some out there I don't know
[1:35:34] this new age New World thing I don't I
[1:35:36] don't
[1:35:40] know gentlemen want to get married they
[1:35:42] want to find that
[1:35:44] rest they want to ease in to that
[1:35:47] happiness
[1:35:54] but I will tell you not by experience
[1:35:57] this is one thing I haven't
[1:36:00] experienced if you marry the wrong
[1:36:03] one you're not going to find any rest
[1:36:06] that's right right it's going to be
[1:36:09] miserable right so true
[1:36:13] brother it's going to be
[1:36:16] hard to come home to an
[1:36:20] unhappy lady or man
[1:36:23] and it only lasts so long that's
[1:36:26] right the honeymoon will come to an end
[1:36:30] that's
[1:36:33] right and if you can't find the right
[1:36:35] one and be patient and pray to the Lord
[1:36:40] for the right one well I'm going to be
[1:36:42] an old
[1:36:44] maid better you be an old maid than be
[1:36:47] married to the wrong one right that's
[1:36:50] right no one will ever love me you got
[1:36:53] lots of people that love you if God's
[1:36:55] called you to that
[1:36:57] life he's called you to it and he'll
[1:36:59] help you get through it but you don't
[1:37:01] want to marry the wrong one that's right
[1:37:03] seen it over and over and over and over
[1:37:09] and over again yes sir but
[1:37:12] yet we got Testaments of the ones right
[1:37:16] here I think of of of even brother Rob
[1:37:19] and Sister Sarah they they didn't come
[1:37:21] to the Lord till after they were married
[1:37:24] and had kids that's Grace they still get
[1:37:27] along right brother
[1:37:29] [Laughter]
[1:37:32] Rob but that's the grace of God
[1:37:35] right and if you can find and wait on
[1:37:38] the Lord right cuz I I I know you you
[1:37:43] get to a certain age and you you you
[1:37:44] become
[1:37:45] lonely true you get lonely and you could
[1:37:48] have a room I could remember in Arizona
[1:37:50] I wasn't serving the lord at the time
[1:37:52] but I have people in my house
[1:37:56] constantly sitting on the edge of the
[1:37:58] bed being so lonely with people all
[1:38:01] around
[1:38:02] me just
[1:38:06] lonely and we don't rest in the promise
[1:38:09] that God said sure he'll
[1:38:13] provide he'll get you with the right
[1:38:18] person you can have happiness and joy
[1:38:22] and all those things if you don't get
[1:38:24] out ahead of
[1:38:28] God
[1:38:33] Amen so Ora gave
[1:38:36] up she went
[1:38:40] back she wasn't committed into what she
[1:38:44] said I'm going to go where you go and
[1:38:46] and and and what we tend to think
[1:38:49] sometimes I think we get this out of
[1:38:51] skew a little
[1:38:52] bit but Naomi was
[1:38:55] backslid right her whole family was
[1:38:59] backslid they shouldn't have been there
[1:39:01] in the first
[1:39:09] place yet she was going back to the
[1:39:12] Homeland she was committed she had
[1:39:17] nothing fully committed she was ready to
[1:39:20] sit in that chair
[1:39:23] in spite of all that she had against
[1:39:27] her and Ruth was right there with
[1:39:33] her that's the other thing maybe we
[1:39:36] should just touch on right before I
[1:39:37] close because I I'm I'm not going to
[1:39:40] wear you
[1:39:45] out Ruth Naomi
[1:39:49] wara their husbands I can't call them
[1:39:52] all my memory is not that
[1:39:54] good they were all backslid in the wrong
[1:39:59] land so if they were just going
[1:40:02] wild you think how how much you think
[1:40:05] Jehovah came up in that conversation
[1:40:07] that's
[1:40:09] right the problem
[1:40:15] was Naomi's
[1:40:17] husband wasn't committed to the promise
[1:40:20] right
[1:40:24] and so when he wasn't committed to the
[1:40:25] promise it's not that he he stopped
[1:40:27] being
[1:40:29] Jewish it's not that he wanted to to
[1:40:32] start sacrificing his children to to the
[1:40:35] moab's god or anything like that he just
[1:40:37] he just wasn't fully committed right to
[1:40:41] what God had said he would do yeah yes
[1:40:44] sir
[1:40:48] right so what did he he threw his whole
[1:40:51] family in a tail spin right
[1:40:54] the whole thing got out of
[1:40:56] cater the whole thing warped and put him
[1:40:59] in a
[1:41:01] place that they should have never
[1:41:04] been amen that's
[1:41:07] right you see families moving away from
[1:41:09] church not necessarily this church or
[1:41:11] any church but just moving for a job or
[1:41:13] moving for this or that uhoh come on
[1:41:17] uh-oh that's right go on down to Moab
[1:41:21] you don't have a place to feed and you
[1:41:23] don't have a place that you can really
[1:41:25] get fed and don't have Fellowship you're
[1:41:27] in trouble
[1:41:32] right and so this
[1:41:35] man I wish I would have looked up his
[1:41:41] name put his whole family in a
[1:41:46] place where they truly couldn't
[1:41:51] rest can you
[1:41:55] imagine them going down the
[1:41:57] street down to the grocery store and
[1:42:00] they see A
[1:42:02] procession what's
[1:42:04] that what what what's
[1:42:07] that oh we're we're going now we're
[1:42:11] going to offer sacrifice to g day God
[1:42:14] really I I don't see no
[1:42:18] Lambs right I don't see no goats
[1:42:23] no turtle
[1:42:26] doves
[1:42:28] H what where's your
[1:42:31] sacrifice oh it's this little girl here
[1:42:38] right they didn't plan for that that
[1:42:41] wasn't in the
[1:42:43] brochure right
[1:42:48] right and yet they found themselves in
[1:42:50] that situation right right yeah you ever
[1:42:54] find yourself in that kind of situation
[1:42:56] very
[1:42:57] uncomfortable yeah what has happened all
[1:43:01] of a
[1:43:02] sudden
[1:43:05] sure all of a sudden what in the world
[1:43:09] is going
[1:43:13] on
[1:43:16] somewhere
[1:43:20] somehow you'll let me put it this way
[1:43:22] you will never
[1:43:23] get into a situation where God can't
[1:43:26] keep you and where you will be con uh in
[1:43:29] complete control yeah and you will be
[1:43:33] comfortable and able to
[1:43:36] rest as
[1:43:38] long as you stay within the boundary of
[1:43:40] his word yeah right when you start
[1:43:43] tempting it
[1:43:49] right I like going to baseball stadiums
[1:43:53] I go to professional I do but I
[1:43:56] know that that's not God's ground that's
[1:44:04] right I
[1:44:06] know W brother John you're admitting
[1:44:08] something right
[1:44:11] now I know that ball fields and those
[1:44:15] kind of places especially the higher up
[1:44:16] you go to Tennessee or whatever you are
[1:44:19] take I'm I I like to watch football I
[1:44:23] like to watch baseball nothing wrong
[1:44:25] with that in
[1:44:26] itself right and I don't plan on
[1:44:29] partaking in any of those
[1:44:32] situations right I don't go there and
[1:44:35] say well praise God I'm at the Ballpark
[1:44:36] give me a beard
[1:44:39] no I'm there to watch the game right
[1:44:42] right but I know when I step out of that
[1:44:46] or or into
[1:44:49] that there's a chance that some drunk
[1:44:52] idiot it's going to spill beer on my
[1:44:54] wife amen and you talk about being
[1:45:01] uncomfortable
[1:45:03] yeah it's getting tight but John you're
[1:45:06] you're you're admitting something I'm
[1:45:08] just telling you that's that's I know
[1:45:10] that going
[1:45:12] in right it's okay shame on
[1:45:16] me cuz I found that
[1:45:19] situations will often arise right if
[1:45:22] you're you're not careful yes sir sure
[1:45:25] you can do all the preventative stuff
[1:45:27] that you want right right I've taken my
[1:45:29] wife we went and watched a Cincinnati
[1:45:31] Reds game cuz I like baseball just to
[1:45:34] watch baseball there's people behind us
[1:45:38] they didn't spill beer on her but she
[1:45:39] was like what is that
[1:45:42] smell that's right they kicked the cup
[1:45:44] over underneath the
[1:45:47] seat nothing nothing came of it true but
[1:45:51] it just makes you more aware
[1:45:53] yeah that's right do I think it's
[1:45:57] wrong no do I think it's right no right
[1:46:02] it's one of those those
[1:46:06] places it's one of those
[1:46:13] things you probably won't have to hear
[1:46:15] me preach ever
[1:46:17] [Laughter]
[1:46:19] again that's good come on but I'm just
[1:46:22] right down where we live that's right I
[1:46:25] live like you
[1:46:31] live there's always when you go outside
[1:46:34] of God's
[1:46:35] boundaries now I don't I don't see in
[1:46:37] the in the
[1:46:38] message where brother brandom said do
[1:46:41] not
[1:46:42] go don't see it it's not there
[1:46:46] right he said you should be in church
[1:46:49] rather than one of those places right we
[1:46:53] we need to keep that in
[1:46:58] mind come
[1:47:00] on but that's
[1:47:03] where Naomi's husband found himself in
[1:47:06] an uncomfortable
[1:47:08] situation in a
[1:47:10] place at a time and he brought his whole
[1:47:14] family there yes and he rested in
[1:47:20] that h
[1:47:24] I don't think you should have season
[1:47:25] tickets to the Reds baseball
[1:47:29] games I'm not coning any of that but I
[1:47:33] don't see a problem with going every now
[1:47:35] and then to to watch a baseball game I
[1:47:37] try and find tickets away from
[1:47:44] everybody but Naomi's husband settled
[1:47:47] right in there he
[1:47:49] lived in Moab
[1:47:54] when he left in the morning with his
[1:47:56] lunch
[1:47:57] pail he stepped out into
[1:48:04] Moab and he went to his job and it
[1:48:09] was in the midst of
[1:48:15] Moab and he went as much as he wanted to
[1:48:18] sanctify his house guess where it was
[1:48:23] in
[1:48:24] Moab yes
[1:48:32] sir he died his son died his other son
[1:48:40] died and Naomi got a
[1:48:44] clue brothers and sisters
[1:48:52] God is
[1:48:55] constantly warning us keeping us
[1:49:00] watching us he loves us more than
[1:49:03] anything
[1:49:08] else and when we find ourselves in those
[1:49:11] situations in those things and he's
[1:49:13] telling us telling
[1:49:17] us you better wake up
[1:49:20] right you're going to lose your family
[1:49:25] well not if they're
[1:49:27] predestinated come
[1:49:29] on oh
[1:49:32] goodness you're right they'll be there
[1:49:35] if they're
[1:49:37] predestinated but I don't want my kids
[1:49:40] dragging in beat down wore out scars all
[1:49:46] over them that's right that's good
[1:49:49] because the choices that I made right
[1:49:52] good right
[1:49:55] right okay
[1:49:58] Lord but that's what we're facing what
[1:50:01] families are
[1:50:03] facing when we don't fully commit to
[1:50:06] what God's word says and like I said you
[1:50:09] go outside of those bounds in those gray
[1:50:13] areas you get in
[1:50:16] trouble get in trouble real quick
[1:50:22] how can you have
[1:50:26] rest you think Naomi and her husband and
[1:50:31] her boys when after they got back home
[1:50:35] saw those little children getting
[1:50:37] sacrificed how well do you think they
[1:50:44] rested they
[1:50:46] didn't neither would I right neither
[1:50:50] would you
[1:50:52] well brother John we don't have to worry
[1:50:54] about
[1:50:56] that not a
[1:50:59] physical right
[1:51:02] sacrifice but there are people in this
[1:51:07] world that would sell their their
[1:51:10] children for a little bit of crack
[1:51:14] yeah or a a little bit of alcohol
[1:51:19] true right they're committed to that
[1:51:22] right and they don't care about anything
[1:51:25] else that's the type of world we live in
[1:51:27] brothers and sisters if you don't know
[1:51:29] you know now yes
[1:51:32] sir people are crazy yes
[1:51:43] true let me find a place here
[1:52:03] Redemption by power it says if you'll

[1:52:08] had come out of darkness and accepted
[1:52:10] the

[1:52:24] while the children of Israel who had
[1:52:26] come out of darkness and accepted the
[1:52:29] light when they got in trouble the line

[1:52:36] slept all
[1:52:37] night and while they were
[1:52:40] sleeping God was sending a wind blowing
[1:52:43] down across the sea opening up a way of
[1:52:47] Escape Hallelujah to the lamb I'm so
