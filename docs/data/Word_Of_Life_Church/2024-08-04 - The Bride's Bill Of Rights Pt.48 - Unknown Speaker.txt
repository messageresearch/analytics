have believed that for generations for centuries yet we have more prophecies more signs of that being true than any generation that's ever been on the face of the Earth I'm glad I'm prepared for it aren't you praise the lord we greet you today in the name of the Lord Jesus what a great privilege it is for us to be gathered together today not only to come and have our our needs met and to be able to sing together and worship and pray and bring requests but also to be able to minister to our husband the Lord Jesus Prophet tells us that the wife ministers to the husband I know it's so in the natural sense I'm know with my wife she prepares meals she picks out these clothes and irons them and you brothers that have wives and you know how that is and she ministers to you and the Lord Jesus is here today in this service not only just to help us whether not you understand it he so orchestrated it that he needs ministering to loving gently caring for him I want to give him that don't you let's read today Matthew chap 8 ver14 we've been speaking about um the rights that the bride has and today I'd like to look at the right to a Ministry the right to a Ministry Matthew 8:14 and when Jesus was coming to Peter's house he saw his wife's mother laid and sick of a fever and he touched her hand and the fever left her and she arose and ministered unto them as I mentioned to you last Sunday she didn't take a scroll or the Torah or anything like that and take a scripture and tell Jesus and all the rest of the Apostles to sit down and she was going to preach to them but she actually ministered to them so she prepared them food and ministered to them just simply as a reminder but the word ministered here is the comes from the Greek word the same word that we have the word Deacon from it's deonia is the Greek word and it means to help or minister to serve food 1 Corinthians 1615 I beseech you Brethren you know the house of stephanus that it is the first fruits of aaya and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the Saints so here it's the same word again deonia service ministering the service of those who prepare and present food I may like to be remembered today as we pray I got a text from Brother Brad Gilbert earlier and been really sick all during the night vomiting a lot of pain and stuff so he wanted us to to remember him so let's pray for him as well today Heavenly Father we love you so much today here in these songs Lord Jesus and KN knowing that there's a place for us No More Tears no more sighing no more sorrow no burdens no difficulties then Harry's song following up with it Lord or almost home father we know that sometimes that last smile can be the hardest one of all I remember several years ago Lord when I was with brother bisc and we were on a safarians in bubbly and he had shot an animal and it had got away from us and we treed after that for many many miles on foot he stepped on a thorn and broke it off in his foot and he was in a lot of pain and we wasn't prepared for that so we didn't take anything to drink anything to eat and it got so difficult and the brothers that we were with said look you Brothers you're going to have to stay here don't you go anywhere we'll go back can get help and sure enough they did they went and got drinks and some food and things and it seemed that we couldn't make it any farther but help was on the way we believe Lord Jesus no matter how difficult this life may get and the things we go through there's help on the way we're not just looking for a temporary help but we're looking for a permanent change amen father you saw all the needs hundreds of hands went up today that signified needs desires request we pray also for Brother Brad Gilbert Lord had a rough night and not feeling good today we also remember brother Daryl Lord sick and pray that you'd be mindful of every need here today Father those that would desire to be here and couldn't be help us Lord Jesus I stand in such need of you father is it's Fallen my lot to try to speak something from your word that would help your children help me to get out of the way father I pray we commit the service to you Lord Jesus I'm going to preach with this handkerchief today you see also our sister tresa Lord what she's going through in her body and facing some things here Lord in the next few days and we're asking you for your mercy that you'd be with our sister Lord we rebuke the hand of the devil that would try to afflict and take the lives of your children we know if it were not for the grace of God there wouldn't be a one of us Left Alive cuz he hates us so much but we know the purpose of God must be fulfilled in our lives and the devil cannot take us until that purpose is done be with our sister father May the angels of God accompany her Lord doctors visit surgery and whatever more Grant it father we pray in the name of Jesus Jesus amen God bless you Saints you may be seated today Ministry is such a wonderful thing what God gives to individuals to help them to help others of course Ministry is not for the sake of the one who has it it's not for the sake of making one famous Rich important it's to be able to as the word certainly designates minister to others every Ministry has a great cost a great price that it exacts from the individual who has it and many times from family members and Friends of that one who has it most of the time a minister is not the only one that has to pay a price for that Ministry depending on what type of ministry it is and scope that it'll be how much coverage it will have it can exact a price from a lot of people and it's the same with whether it's a housewife or a farmer or a businessman each one of us has a Ministry how many believes that today let me just go back a little bit on a couple of things that we looked at Sunday last Sunday and the prophet says it this way many times people go out and see an evangelist like for instance our brother Billy Graham what good would it do for me to try to be like Billy Graham I couldn't do it if I had to I've got a Ministry that I've got to take care of and the next man's got his ministry each one has got a Ministry even to the housewife to for the housewife has a Ministry of ministering the word of God and yet we know we don't believe in women preachers so what in the world is a housewife going to minister the word and to whom will she Ministry and I want you to realize that he says here the housewife has a Ministry of ministering the word of God and every person that comes to the Lord Jesus has some sort of ministry that ministry will be unique according to your family according to your makeup according to your call doesn't mean that every one of us is going to start picking up Bibles and you know having discourses of Doctrine And discussing great theological terms and this and that and everybody's going to quit their job everybody's going to start entering into the ministry well but believe it or not sometimes your job is your ministry you see it's such an important thing this is why Satan spends so much of his time to keep each of us out of our ministry for me personally it's been a battle in my Ministry since I started preaching whenever I was an 18-year-old boy 50 years now I've been preaching has it got any easier it's actually harder now than it's ever been and in every Ministry you will face discouragement you will feel like your work is in vain you will feel like that you're putting forth so much effort and doing so much stuff and in this life it may look as if though you're getting so few results according to the effort you put forth it would be understandable if every Ministry housewife preacher farmer electrician painter um what construction whatever you're in if we hardly put forth any effort at all and we just you know we just took it as casual and ain't no big deal God called me God saved me God made me a housewife God made me a mother God made me a father and I'm supposed to minister to my family but I'll just sort of do as I want to do and and he'll he'll understand understand and he'll compensate for the difference but even for you mothers that give so much and how much do you do for your family and it can go seemingly so unappreciated you prepare a meal and you may spend several hours and getting it ready you may start early in the morning doing certain things and then you'll do a little bit more as the day progresses and when your family sits down to eat all they can say is well this was burn a little bit and this was a little bit too salty and this had a little bit too much pepper and I was wanting chicken I wasn't wanting tenderloin for for supper and for a wife a mother it can seem like the only thing that you could hear from your family is what they didn't like what they didn't want and what they wish they would have had and very little appreciation for your ministry come on I'm sure you sisters have been there before and does it make you want to cook another meal or does it make you the next time you go to the grocery store want to buy stofers lasagna spaghetti rotti and whatever more and say push the button pal fix what you want suit yourself because I can't please none of you now I'm sure none of our sisters have ever said anything like that ah your Grands are giving you away sister but you see whether it's it's a preacher in the pull pit that may spend days in preparation now I could go the easy route as the pastor I could get a thought from the Lord I could get two or three scriptures two three quotes and preach about 25 30 minutes something like that just give you a little something to where that you say well he did have some word he had some you know he had some good things to say and I could say well praise the Lord I give them a little sermonette today and I think they got something that would help them or I could do the way I always do spend days hours sometimes look sometimes at hundreds of scriptures hundreds of quotes and then spend all kinds of hours putting it together and then whenever I bring it a lot of times people do whatever they want to do anyway so if I preach on don't do this don't do that don't do that don't do that don't do that don't do that don't do that don't do that don't do that you know what a lot of people do they do this they do this they do this they do this they do this this this this and this that I said don't do it it's going to get you in trouble yeah and then I think you know what I wonder if I'm wasting my time I know I'm not I know I'm not just like you mother are not wasting your time when you try to teach your daughters the value of morality you try to teach your sons the value of morality just something as simple as honey make your bed before you go to school make your bed pick up your clothes pick up your shoes you know do this do that help Mama out help Daddy out and say oh well Mama you're you're you're home all day that's only part of the issue if you're allow to do that at home then when you get married guess what you're going to do same thing whenever you get married and people it's easier we all know it's easier just to go the easier way in the day we're living so that's what a lot of people are doing preachers are doing it deacons can do it everybody according to their Ministry mothers can do it if you cross your children I'm going to tell you if you cross your children and tell them you can't go here you can't do this you can't do that and you know what makes it so hard is because they go to church with kids and their parents let them get by with everything but murder and then you're telling your kids we don't do that in our home but Mama they go to the same church we do they go the brother Donnie is their Pastor too and then they can do this and do that and get by with it but you see God will never make you and answer for someone else the way they rais their kids he's going to make you answer for the way you raise yours and it's the same with a pastor a pastor could go the easier way and it tends to follow true to form that the older that preachers get they tend to get softer they tend to get to where that you know they enter into what many of them identifi as years and gray hair and false teeth and all that sort of thing with wisdom and they think well you know you don't have to preach it near as hard as you used to and the next thing you know you look around and the church looks totally different they dress in in ways they used to didn't dress when that same preacher was 25 years younger well come on somebody I don't call that wisdom I call it compromise it's easier oh yeah it's easier because as you get older you get weary with all the battles now no don't don't think here today that I'm ready to resign are you kidding me I wouldn't give hell the relief to do that but I want you to see that I know how you feel about your ministry and believe it or not if you would go by the way you feel then you'd get a good idea of the way I feel about mine and the Lord Jesus went that way so he would be able to know how we all feel and he allowed the prophet to have those discouraging times and heartbreaking times can you imagine Paul uh preaching to the church that he himself established in Corinth and I mean they were a church that they had Supernatural gifts it was unbelievable they was one of the most gifted churches in the New Testament but that church had major problems I mean they had adultery they had one man living with his stepmother while still coming to church still shouting jumping jerking speaking in tongues and whatever and the people around him nobody wasn't rebuking it nobody wouldn't saying nothing about it they just had all kinds of issues how discouraging it must have been for that man that spent so much time now remember what God said about the city of Corinth God told him I have much people in this city but I wonder how that he must have laid awake at night and been so disheartened and so discouraged thinking I am wasting my time on these people now it wasn't everybody that could deal with that you know I I know you know it before but Paul said that we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure I'd like to bring it to you sometime if the Lord would let me that Paul said that he wouldn't even go into areas where the the name of Christ had been spoken lest he would build on another man's Foundation did you ever wonder why Paul did not write a letter to the church at Jerusalem did you ever wonder why Paul never wrote a letter to the church at Babylon which was the church that Peter founded now the original mother church was Jerusalem there are no letters written from Paul to the church at Jerusalem why it was not under the scope as it were of his ministry and he said I don't want to build on another man's Foundation which was whose Foundation Peter and the original 12 so where were Paul's letters written to the churches that God had him to found you understand that some men would not have any Ministry or have no one to preach to if they did not build it on another man's Foundation now it's the same in your ministry you see you might get input from your mother on How to be the right kind of mother you Brothers might get input from your father or from brothers that you have confidence in on how to re be the right kind of father right kind of leader in your home and you can take from that but it's inevitable that you will have to have in your home as the head of the home you wives as as being the mother and the wife and being the queen of the home that you will have to find your jurisdiction and you can't say well Mama did it this way well sister Judy did it that way well you know what sister di done it this way and Sister Janet did it that way that might work with sister Janet's kids but it don't mean that it'll work with yours so you have to find and not build upon another's foundation and say well this is the way we do here that's the way they done it and I'm going to do exactly the way they do you know it's a shame really that Satan has taken the form of this message and tried to make everybody exactly the same way well I've traveled this world I've been all over Africa different parts of India different parts of Canada different parts of the world and it's amazing when you go among the Latin uh speaking people how different they are say Venezuela and South America and then you go just north of there into Mexico still Spanish-speaking people and yet so different in the way their music is and the way their singing is but you know what a lot of folks in the message want to do they want everybody to be exactly the same way God is a god of variety so they want every Church they expect every Church to be exactly identical you're wanting a denomination is what you're want God doesn't want us everyone to be exactly in the same way our word worship is going to be a little bit different maybe than brother Ron Spencer our worship is totally different than brother Fred Mullins I can tell you that right now they going to be visiting with us before long and we fixing to see how black folks worship I'm telling you but now I realize I'm not here to turn you all into a black church because as you know I'm not a black preacher I'm black from within but somehow my skin turned white when I was born but it it would be impersonation for us to try to make ourselves act like somebody else so what we want to find is what is our foundation of our home our foundation of our church and it's amazing because being amongst the brothers around the world and how that God will deal with them and they'll have problems in Zimbabwe we don't have here they'll have issues and you pburg South Africa and ptor and some of the different places there Mumbai and India and the different places around the world we'll never deal with the Saints in New Zealand the Saints in Australia Papa New Guinea and the different places there they will deal with problems we will never deal with so we have to find what God wants us to be same in your ministry now people can think well you know I'm I'm a housewife that has nothing to do with me pleasing God that has everything to do with you pleasing God as a matter of fact I just read it this morning where brother Brandon was talking to the men following the message and he said you men you're supposed to be the head of the home and he said you're supposed to be set your wife and your children and so on in order and he went as far as to say that that is your ministry before Christ Jesus you know sometimes I found it with preachers that they serve God and they give to God and they let their families go to pot Moses was a perfect example of a man that can be so concerned about the people and not even circumcise his own son praise the Lord and we have people that want to do missionary work and they want to knock on the neighbor door and they want to get on Facebook and preach and you know Facebook is even women's platform for a pull pit and they want to get on Facebook and they want to get on social media try to correct people over this you'll be better off a lot of times to be down on your bending knees in prayer you're not going to straighten out a bunch of these Knuckleheads out here in the world you're casting your Pearls Before Swine why would you want to do it they're going to render them and then they're going to turn and on you come on somebody but what we want to do is find the scope of my Ministry I'm not sure you'll understand this but I'm going to share it with you anyway even though I'm a pastor whenever I go out and I will still preach and I may preach some of the same things that I preach to you but yet when I go out and say preach a convention Lord willing brother Andrew Glover and I will be preaching the camp over in South Carolina North Carolina it is now but from Brother Jason Watkins church and whenever I go there I was down to Brother David cider a while back but whenever I visit other men I cannot preach as a pastor now that may seem odd to you I may take some of the same thoughts and some of the same stuff but I am a visiting Minister I am a pastor but I am a visiting Minister the word is always corrective we know that right an evangelist is going to preach correction but an evangelist has a limitation on how far he can go now what you find in with a lot of message churches is a lot of them that believe in Preachers they have no problem with evangelists they have no problem with missionaries they have no problem with a prophet they have no problem even with those going out and starting churches but they problem problem is with a pastor and that's why a lot of them they go from Pastor to Pastor to pastor and their preference is actually getting one evangelist after another to come preach to him you know why because an evangelist will never really get down to where the problems are laying in the administration of the church so they get another evangelist another another another basically an evangelist is taking them to the ER and putting them on steroids and giving them a shot of faith and telling them about this and that and the other but the the evangelists have to come right back again another evangelist have to come back again another had to come back again and the real problem is the lacking of a true head which is called a pastor and the Word of Life said now you see God knows exactly how to place each one of us so all of us that comes to the Lord Jesus has a Ministry notice the prophet said each one of us has a different Ministry each one works different each one has a Ministry a separate Ministry all that comes to Christ has a Ministry now think this is not just preachers every young man all you young brothers sitting right here all you Sisters You Youth every one of you have some sort of ministry and it's not my place to tell you what it is it's not even your mama's place or your daddy's place you were brought on the Earth by almighty God and you need to go to him you see one of the worst things we can do for those of you that are not preachers is to feel like well brother Donnie can't go here and there and you know he he he said before he'd rather have a little church but of course God won't let him leave our church because he he's a minister well what's the difference if I want to go to a small church and God won't let me yet God made you a part of a big church and you choose to go to a little one so God deals with you different than does me God whoops the fire out of me and makes me stay with a big church big church big problem big church large problems you know and God makes me deal with it my whole Ministry and then let you get by with it no I'm sorry it's not you know what the problem is people don't look at their ministry as the same way that God looks at it so if they failed as a housewife no big deal I'm still a Christian I'm full of the Holy Ghost but what if God Incorporated ated that walk with God to be a part of your administration of being a housewife or being a father as well as a husband a farmer amen all that comes into Christ has a ministry that's right not only the preacher but you have a Ministry and the church said something you can do I hope this don't sound sacr religious but usually God has to drive you into your correct Ministry so every individual has a Ministry there's a part about motherhood that you mothers know is absolutely awesome and there's Parts about that that can be so difficult I have to be very honest with you this morning I was never very good in the diaper Department the lord gave me a missionary heart but I didn't get a missionary stomach to go with it so odors and different things like that woo this old boy gets sick on a horse in a minute I'm talking about so with our girls there was things that I just couldn't do I just simply no matter how hard I tried I just couldn't do it but I'm so glad that my little Godly wife it was part of her Ministry oh she said it more than once Donnie get out of the way just let me do it just let me do it well you know whenever we look at it each of us have a scope of our call now so the prophet said usually God has to drive you into your correct Ministry so maybe some of you sisters you're you're unmarried and oh you go to these youth camps and you find young men that'll visit our church from other meetings or youth servic that we have and you know you want them to come spiritually for something from the Lord but you're also looking for a boyfriend come on I once was young same with you young brothers and then there's there's things about boyfriends and girlfriends and even when you find the right one things about marriage it's just absolutely wonderful but there's things about it that's just uh difficult hard and people say well it's 5050 not always sometimes it's 90 10 and you're the one giving the 90 and get 10 back uh oh the the microphone did it stop working oh it is working okay but what if God called you brothers and part of your ministry is not just witnessing and going out and going out and helping but it's to be the right kind of father in your home you see many of our message kids now will be molded by the parents for those who lived under the dispensation of the 77 concept that the Rapture was going to come there are some in our church that have paid and are still paying to this day financially because they were taught under previous Ministries the Lord's going to come at 77 so they never made no preparation they never got no degree or no real whatever to be able to provide for their family praise the Lord and then what does that hand down to their kids so you take a preacher that's off the word from the pull pit and he will preach a lopsided version of the message and and then the parents will hand it down to their kids and it can affect one generation after another after another I personally don't want that for you now I don't have no clue no idea how long I live I don't have no idea how long it's going to be before the Lord comes but I want to arm you and equip you with the very best that I can so if in a few years the Lord takes me off the scene or in a month and if the Lord takes me off the scene and you have to get somebody else that somebody will be able to step in there and be able to build hopefully I've laid a foundation through the years of something that another man can come sure he'll have his own makeup and his own ideas about this and that and the other but where he'll not have to go in there and tear all of this out and rip all of that out and have to totally start over again but just be able to build right on that same foundation and lay more blocks and more building blocks and more building blocks of the word to be able to prepare a people for the coming of the Lord Jesus ain't that what we want well you see you men that's what you need to do to your children we need to live as if though the Lord Jesus could come today and as if though your life could end today but also planning as if though there might be another generation I honestly don't see how they could be but I did not believe would ever be here in 2024 whenever we come to the message in 1983 I felt like and I even preached it years ago to that little church in Kentucky that we were probably some of the last ones cuz that Prophet had been gone and not since 1965 didn't I har you probably remember you and K are there brother Larry brother ter and sister Dre brother hard and sister were there and I I felt the urgency I thought my we must be the last ones but I'm so glad God let us come in under that urgency instead of just kind of setting back well who knows who knows how long it'll be I wonder how Donnie Reagan would have been different if the Lord would have let me see that time would go on to 2024 or 2028 or 2030 whatever it is and I thought well praise the lord we got plenty of time man there ain't no need and just going in Hook Line and Sinker I doubt very seriously I would have went to the Monella Banking Company and borrowed $1,500 and went to Jeffersonville and bought tapes and books and pictures and C books and everything that I could buy to be able to put in our church I doubt very seriously I would have done that because I would have thought well we got plenty of time my 2024 2028 we'll just kind of ease into this thing we'll just ease into it so I preach in March the 27th 1983 that God sent a prophet May at the end of May in 1983 I preached the coming of the son of man so from the end of March till May I had listen to tapes day in day out night in Night Out sang up listening to tape studying reading praying and it's like God picked me up and throwed me right in the middle of the furnace and said get lit or get out I'm so glad that I did not approach it in the nonchalant laidback white don't you understand that's what a lot of folks around the message are doing with their own Ministry you're approaching it like you've got plenty of time where do you get that idea where do you get you have got another hour to live where do you get oh some of you men you brothers and sisters you're up in your 60s and 70s and maybe 80s now you saying well it's a time just to kind of quit you know and just lay back and relax there's never a time to quit until death comes and grabs a hold of us and Carries us across to the other side how I appreciate I've said it before I'm going to say it again how I appreciate some of these Elder brothers and sisters that are among I don't want to just wait till they pass away let me let me give them a rose right now don't you appreciate some of these Elders that have been around for years and years and years still coming to the house of God still being an influence still being an encouragement to you and I I I realize if the Lord terries a few more years myself and brother Daryl and some of the other ministers will be the elders in the ministry I think oh Lord have mercy I I mean I'm contacted by Young preachers from all over the world asking about this and that and the other and it's just hit me in the last couple of years Donnie do you realize why they're doing that you're an old man dude you're an old man I mean you better preach while you can you better do what you can do it and do it fast that's why brother Daryl goes why he does because he's told me several times brother Donnie I'm one of the oldest evangelist on the field brother Jackie used to be and brother Daryl's getting up in years I'm getting up up in years I want to do everything for the kingdom of God that I can and you'd say oh yes brother Donnie do it while I'm throwing it back in your lap and saying you've got a Ministry sister you've got a Ministry brother Mother what is that oh be a Godly mother to your children be the right kind of Life how can I be spiritual and be a mother if we ever needed spiritual mothers we need them now it's evident by the young people that we see on our streets all you got to do is walk into the mall a little bit Lord have mercy I can't hardly stand that place I go in there every now and then I'm s geve time I get out of there I don't want to care if I ever go back again the way they dress the way they do the old Spirits they got on them what is it it's a lack at home we can't just blame the kids it's a lack at home oh my God stir every man every woman every boy and every girl in our assembly today to help you to realize you have a Ministry that you're going to give account of don't just think that these preacher brothers are the only ones that's going to stand before God you and you sisters understand you're going to give an account of your ministry as a mother you're going to give an account of your ministry as a wife and you're saying oh I'm a holy ghost fil sister I love God what good does all that do if you failed as a wife what good does it do you Brothers if you sacrifice and give money for this and that and win this person to the Lord and that person to the Lord but you fail being a Godly husband oh preach with me this morning or you fail to be the right kind of father in your home I don't I don't want to fail the Lord overseas I don't want to fail the Lord in missionary work but I don't want to stand before God that day and him say you built churches here and you done this and you done that and that little woman stand right there and say but Lord he was an awful husband he took care of the church that's true he helped people all over everywhere but he wasn't considerate of me he was not considered of my needs Oh Glory to God when I stand before God I'm I'm just as concerned this morning of hearing the Lord Jesus say you were a Godly husband you were a Godly father I don't want him to hear just to hear him say you was a dedicated Pastor you spent so much time in studying I see you studied for hours until your arms would get so so pain and you'd start having pain in the middle of your back where you'd sit there for hours and have to get up and walk around and then say you failed as a father you failed as a grandfather you failed as an uncle you failed as a husband I don't want to fail nowhere come on somebody I want to be a Godly Daddy I want to be a Godly grandfather I want my granddaughters to love me I want my son-in-laws to love me I want my children come on somebody it ought to be every man woman boy and girl the desire of your heart to go before the Lord Jesus and say help me Lord that I don't fail in my Ministry oh God no notice in Jehovah gy says each one of us has a work to do each one of us has a Ministry a Ministry and the peculiarity of it and so forth it is all together to glorify who God all working together for good now the Lord be with us and help us watch out Paul writing to this troubled Church in Corinth 1 Corinthians 12124 as the body is one and has many members and all watch all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ people focus on the church and they say well all this that brother Donnie's doing don't you never believe that what in the world could I do without people sir what could I do without helps what can I do without other minister brothers that are here deacons trustees Sunday school teacher our church don't function just by [Music] me don't make no Idol out of any preacher for the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because I am not the hand I am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the ear shall say because I am not the eye I am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the whole body whole were hearing were were the smelling Now watch how he takes the natural anatomy of the human body and then Taps into the spiritual body of Christ so we got prayer warriors we've got people that fast we've got people that have the desire on their heart to reach out to others and they they see this brother and sister not coming to church you know they miss a service and then they miss another service and they they miss another service that's not just the Deacon's responsibility and the pastor's responsibility you know you brothers and sisters you should be mindful brother have been missing your church where are you you understand that's one of the downsides of a larger church that people can miss church for several services and people don't even know if they're there or not there don't you understand you need to look around and see who sets by you see who sits near you and realize you it's not just me it's not just the deacons and the preachers it's us loving one another another caring for one another oh I know you think this ain't very deep this morning but I'm preaching to you a message that the bride will be into this state before the Rapture takes place that we love one another so much brother R said at his church that preachers would ask him how do you get them people in such love with each other and he said they would go to church on Sunday night and close out the Sunday night service and they'd stand around and weep and hold one another and say I can't wait to see you again on Wednesday they just CED cuz they loved one another so much and he different preachers he said but asking how do you do that he said just preach the Bible just preach the truth well what's amazing is he's telling the church the same brhom Tabernacle several years after that and letting them know they needed to move up to that now they moved up to deeper teachings but them teachings had all kinds of differences among them so you know what they done spent more time arguing fussing for those of you who think the brandham Tabernacle was a perfect Church you're ignorant I have per personal friends that were deacons and so on at that place they had to deal with all types of issues and you say my goodness why in the world would that be because the devil wants to come right there the devil didn't where did the devil show up and in the Book of Genesis he didn't show up in Hades he showed up in the Garden of Eden come on somebody so we know that's exactly what he wants to do in your home he wants to destroy the love between a husband and wife he wants to destroy the love between a mother and her children a father and a family unit and our church church is no stronger than the families who make it up if we want a closer church if we want a more Godly Church a more holy church we need families that are closer together and we say Lord God help us that we'll never let anything come between us that will divide us we will forgive one another we will tolerate one another's faults come on somebody oh yes there's something about that as the ministry of the body we're going to church with people that aren't perfect I'm talking to a brother this week and he's talking about people looking for a perfect church I said why in this world would anybody look for a perfect Church there is no such a thing and if you ever found one and you went there you'd ruin the whole program but you've got preachers that are faulty you've got people that are faulty church is like a hospital it's like going to a doctor's office do you go to to the doctor's office and everybody there is well everybody there is doing good they're coughing they're hiking they're spitting they've got everything in the world wrong with them why that's where sick people go well the church is the same way we've got people with problems we got people with issues oh brother Donnie I'm going to wait till I get right then I'll come no come on come on come on and get right here this is a good place to get right with God someone had mentioned to Carol some time back said someone said well they they wanted to come to church but they had a certain habit that they was dealing with and they just didn't figure out I told car I said you text them back right now and tell them I said come to church cuz it's one of the best places I Oh Glory to God I know uh to get delivered of a habit don't stay at home that's exactly what the devil wants you to do well I'm going to stay home and when I get good enough I'll come to church you'll never come to church because you ain't never going to be good enough I ain't good enough you ain't good enough you ain't good enough there's not a one of us that are good enough but we come to the house of God that God can reshape Our Lives oh my notice this in the great warrior David the scripture said those who he has called is Justified those who he has Justified he glorified Amen in the presence of almighty God get ready devil your name's indelibly wrote with the blood of Jesus Christ Glory ified in his presence positionally placed here on Earth for a purpose to do the will of God you see your position Christian you say can that well brother Bram I wasn't called to be a preacher you might not oh you might be called to be a housewife you mean being a housewife is a calling it's proof every every woman that gives birth to a child is not really the right kind of mother it's evident every man that can sire a child does not necessarily make him a good father it just makes him a progator that he can be able to reproduce himself don't you understand being a real mother is a calling being a real father is a calling being a real Godly church member in this assembly is a calling now membership of course the church has substituted membership well come on now we'll do everything we can to fill the place let's bring them all in let's have hot dog suppers and hamburger suppers and let's bring the grill well we may not do it on a grill but we got hide smoking around here just about every service anyhow so if you're looking for hide smoking this is the right place I don't know so much about hot dogs and hamburgers but we want to be right with God don't we Saints and we want to have a place that the Holy Ghost can move heal the sick cast out Devils deliver those that are bound and help the Saints find their Ministry watch's this you might be called to be a housewife but you got your position in Christ Jesus by the Holy Ghost to be a housewife so you mean that is a spiritual position it's worth more than you will ever know I figure now listen you're just as much as David and the rest of them can you imagine a Godly housewife mops the floors sweeps the floors vacuums you know does all the things that a housewife does lives the word of God goes gets her groceries people laugh at her make fun of because the way she looks and dresses and so on and God looks at her and says another David another David down there in Food City another David over in krer go on our daughter conquer them bobbed hair Devils all you're doing is just pushing down to the okay I need a corn starch I need a vinegar I need need you know half a gallon of milk I need this that and you're just going down through there minding your own business pushing your buggy them Devils backing up look out look out look out here comes a daughter of God oh my you're not preaching you ain't got your Bible what are you you're the word on display you don't understand what it does in that other realm you're not doing it because of tradition oh you sisters I know many of you you don't dress this way and do this way because you're scared you go to hell you do it because the Lord Jesus wants you to and you want to please him so much ain't that right that's why it's a desire inside of your heart and when them Devils see you coming you better believe they're terrified you better believe Brothers you said well brother Donnie I couldn't put six quotes together six scriptures together that's a good thing about the Lord he's able to put them together in our soul when we can't put them together in our head but we're taking that word every one of those quotes every one of those scriptures that you put in your life you are the one sming living breathing word written Epistles known and read of all men [Music] oh listen this adoption the church positionally before the foundation of the world when God in his labor pain was bringing forth bringing forth you so before the foundation of the [Music] world I want [Applause] Housewives I've always loved the order of this I started studying this probably in ' 84 in adoption after I come into some of the first initial messages notice this he positionally placed you into his own body to be a housewife why in the world would God's Prophet put a housewife in front of the position of a prophet now we would think of course first of all would had to be the prophet a housewife a farmer to be a preacher to be a prophet Lord have mercy housewife farmer preacher Prophet to be this to be that he placed you positionally then when you have come from the garlic lands of Egypt through sanctification and baptized into the promised land oh it's glorious to find your position and no one can do anything unless you know properly what you're doing you said but don't why why why is that so important we must have faith in our position you see the climax of the ages will wind up in this bride being positionally placed what she is when she finds her place she will allow him to get in his place which is the headship and he will call the resurrection so as long as they're fussing and arguing and fighting and I'm the greatest we got the biggest church and no we got the biggest church we're bigger than you are there's 5,000 100 people that subscrib to our YouTube channel oh my goodness well there's 5,13 that subscribe to ours and the oh my my as long as we're doing that are we not yet carnal as men but if we can realize God has men and women that'll always maybe as would say be above us there'll always be people that God will call to do more than we are but you know what I don't have to answer for any of them I've got to answer for what little bitty tiny thing that God gives me and I'm going to do my best to use it come on with me somebody it ought to be the same way with you mothers and fathers some of you got several kids in your man family maybe five six seven whatever it is and maybe God just gives some of you one well you know what if he gave you that one you ought to raise it in the admonition and the fear of God and know that God give you a small church but does that mean that you're not supposed to Pastor that little child with all your heart I mean do it with all your heart call them love them spank them when they need it love them when they need to cry on your shoulder do whatever you need to do that's what I have to do I have to break your legs sometimes I've got to wear you out and then we all cry together right and but yet that's what I'm called to do I can't answer for brother Tim's Ministry I cannot answer for brother Barry coffee's Ministry are many of these great Servants of God I'm not even worthy to pack their briefcase but yet God's give me one and I will not I will not let let him down I've made so many mistakes and I've made so many failures but my mistakes does not mean I am a total failure what I find I'm wrong I fix it I straighten it out come on children oh but you say brother Donnie as a housewife I messed up as a mother I messed up sure you have but don't let your mess ups Define who you are you're a daughter of God you're called to that position [Applause] I love this sermon perfect F now remember they had the word and the Word was made flesh then speaking about the apostles and the word told them I give you power amen I give you power and they had the power but they didn't have faith to operate the word that was in them you said what I mean but Jesus had it he was the word and he had faith that what he said would happen he said oh bring him here how long will I suffer you he had Faith with his power can you imagine the Lord Jesus subjecting himself down to our level that he would actually be required to have faith but he was the son of God he was the word but he condescended to such a low place like humans that he required of himself to believe his own word he knew that's going to be your your one of your greatest trials he wanted to go through the struggles of position position my God my God God why has Thou forsaken me in the Garden of Gethsemane father if it be thy will let this cup pass from me he knew he knew there was no one else could die he knew no one else could take that place but he allowed himself to feel that way for me for you I wonder how many in here today bes besides me has ever just felt like just walking away from what God called you and say forget it I hope you don't think I'm weird by saying this I've never never never wanted to turn and go away from the Lord all the years have been saved never never had a desire but I have one to go away from the work many times I've wanted to go away from the word which in reality is him expressed in my own life you understand what I'm saying but it's far as say oh Jesus I'm tired of you I I don't want to serve you no more no no I've never said that and have no desire to say that but I have said what you make me a preacher I don't understand I Don't Preach good I preach loud I'm controversial people don't think I'm nice they think I'm meing a copper head crossed with a rattlesnake and a wolverine they think I'm just slap out evil lot of folks in the message think I blasphemed the Holy Ghost why in the world would you want me to preach every sermon I ever preach I make mistakes I ain't never preached a perfect one in my life I preach thousands of them and ain't never preach a perfect one you tell about discouraging to know that you have never preached one perfect sermon never and never so you already know that before you enter into it you ain't never going to preach a perfect one them just let me know up front and same with you all you're going to fail how many times you sisters fix eggs God bless your hearts poor little young us have to eat them sorry things I mean bless your hearts and you still sometimes will mess it up right and you say what what you going to do you're going to quit cooking so because after the sermon today and I'll relive it tomorrow and the next day and the next day and then it'll be time again we preach Wednesday you know so then I think if if I live under that I'd never preach another i' think forget it just forget it I make so many mistakes and I mess up so bad and some people listen some people don't my goodness as soon as I say Amen 47 of them go to the bathroom all than one time they don't even want to hang around to worship they didn't want to stand around you know just see what the Lord's going to do it's like they can't wait they're chomping at the bits to get up and leave they really don't like hearing you preach noow so if you listen to all that then you say yeah yeah I I can see that I can see that you see I'm up here looking at all of you all you ain't looking at everybody else out there see what they're doing so I'm sitting there amen but it was a wrong time to say amen and you say boy that was really some sermon today wasn't it that was really a blessing huh put you to sleep well praise God maybe you stayed up all night praying for me or something maybe the next time go ahead and sleep it would do me a whole lot more good to see you awake see said there sleep you say I'm afraid this is where we are sometimes they had the power but they didn't have the faith to operate the word that was in them see what I mean Jesus had it he was the word so he had the word but then in paragraph 64 he had Faith with his power how did he said I can do nothing myself why he relied upon what he was he relied in knowing that he was the word he had faith in God who made him the word he was God the word and there was in him and that give him Fai because listen how important this is because he understood his position so you mean to tell me the Lord Jesus brother Joe could never have accomplished all that he did if he would have not have known who he was so it gave him Faith so sisters instead of getting up in the morning and starting your Monday morning routine well I wish I could find the will of God for my life I wish I wish I knew what the Lord was doing here you are you got your oil out you poured it out you skill it you got the maple syrup you know you're fixing pancakes or eggs or sausage what I sure wish I knew what the Lord wanted me to do and there's Jimmy and Johnny and Jackie and Betty and Lucy and Freddy and Billy and whoever more sitting around the table I sure wish I knew what the Lord wanted me to do feed them hungry mouths Mama feed them hungry mouths and if you're homeschooling them God bless your heart then be able to pray over them intill in them not only about Abraham Lincoln and George Washington but instill in them the power of almighty God come on somebody what is it doing then you have faith in your position then whenever things go wrong oh my and it don't work look good and it ain't working out really good how many knows how it can be that way sometimes it seem like the more we do for God and the more that the presence of God comes in his word the harder the battles get the more difficult they get and it's all to discourage you it's to get you down it's to down on you if it ain't just you and your husband it's you and your husband and your daughter and her husband and then your granddaughters and you think well when we get them raised our troubles are over no they ain't they're like rabbits they just keep multiplying and the more you get the more oh my the more troubles they bring with them and you saying oh my I thought when I got them all raised in the empty nest forget that thought about the empty nest it don't never empty out they just move from one place to another amen and God don't want to for those who feel like it ends when their children are grown it's like you are resigning from your ministry can you imagine me resigning and coming to church and just sitting here and not doing nothing Lord have mercy you'd hear the office explosion ever was on 209 quar Run Court what would it be brother Donnie blowed up he'd been down there studying the word but he resigned I'm at the age I could resign but the way I'm looking at it there ain't no retirement for a preacher they just put them out to Pastor yes sir I ain't looking to retire I'm looking to relieve this world because I'm fixing to move to a retirement community and I'm here today to invite every one of you to come and go with me up to this retirement community it is a gated community and nobody over 20 is allowed it is a community it's going to the greatest use rally the world has ever known we will never die just [Applause] say that gave him Faith because he understood his position he knowed what he was because the scripture had said he was this and every scripture tied in to prove that he was exact what the scripture said he would be and he knew what he was therefore he relied upon what God had made him and if he did that then can't we rely upon what God made us as Believers these signs shall follow them that believe he had faith in what he was and if you are a Believer you have faith in what you are you are a Believer praise God mamas make a difference in the life of your kids and when you change dispensations and become grandmother make a difference in the life of your kids spread your light this why the word of God is so against the idea of people not going to church and staying home and living this secluded life nobody knows what you believe nobody knows you're a Christian nobody knows you're a Believer you never sing you never worship you never minister to the body you stay home where is that in the Bible it's not in the Bible nor in the message either I'll tell you what it is it's a spirit of antichrist it's against the original teaching of Christ Jesus he said no man lights a candle and puts it under a bushel but he puts it up in the house for all those to see right may God take our lives and put them on display that's right remember sisters and brothers and young people leave this place today with the the desire in Your Heart Lord help me help me to know my Ministry what you've called me to be I'm a sister I know I can't handle the word some of you Brothers don't never preach the word you don't have to you don't have to but you can live the word live what you're hearing preached then you're fulfilling your purpose in the economy of God you have faith in what you are you are a Believer and if you've got faith in God the Bible says if our hearts condemn us then we can't have faith listen how serious this is but if our hearts don't condemn us then we have faith we have confidence towards God if you want to read that St John 3:21 got the scripture written down here he said oh first John if our hearts condemn us not then we have confidence toward god listen to this carefully but as long as you're doing things that's wrong wrong you can't have confidence toward God so you see you automatically know that you're wrong now the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are it's wonderful to have faith in what brother brandham was it's want to have faith in your mama it's want to have faith in your pastor and you know the song leaders and the musicians and our youth leaders and that's awesome wonderful you know why God will heal you when you come up for me or these other ministers to pray for you cuz you have faith in me if you don't I can help you you have confidence you've seen God perform Miracles and it gives you confidence now what if you would have that same confidence in your own walk before God I am a believer I am a Christian but brother Donnie I'm a human being so you think I'm not but brother Donnie I have mistakes so you think I don't have you saying brother Daryl is perfect faultless there is no such a human being so what do you do if I fall flat on my face I get up dust myself off hit the devil in the Smacker and go right on and live right okay I repent praise the Lord that's why I tell you to do the same thing then I have confidence that he's forgiv me oh my have faith in what you are have faith in what the word says you are Jesus had faith in the word of God that said what he was it's written of me didn't David and the Psalms and the prophets speak of him to me this is so overwhelming that he would subject himself self to such a place that his mechanics had to orchestrate with God's Dynamics in order to produce the Divine results mentioned to you the other day and I'll close with this if we want the Dynamics of God we're going to have to keep our mechanics in order God will not anoint our mechanics if it's full of tradition ideologies of men opinions of this in that God is going to bring the rocket power down among the bride for a Rapture and he will strike only the right mechanics can't you see why God cannot strike trinitarianism and bring trinitarians to a married supper of the lamb and they're going to be looking for three and there ain't going to be three there it's going to be one so the Dynamics power will strike the bride and her mechanics amen let's bow our heads together praise the Lord Jesus I wonder how many here today would say God that's what I want with all my heart I want to find my place I know many of you do CU I get questions from you phone calls texts this that and the other brother Donnie I'm praying about this I'm praying about that I I don't know what to do what is if there's something in us we want to find the will of God even our vocation we're supposed to go to that school we're supposed to be a teacher or are we supposed to be an electrician we supposed to be an electrician we supposed to be a builder are we supposed to you know what are we supposed to do oh how it must please the father that we have that desire in us but don't just look at it as a vocation only but as a Ministry don't spend years of your life going to school young people and then transition in the middle of the road and then then take a bunch more years and go here and then a bunch more years and go there think of how much time you've wasted why you simply miss the will of God how many like to be remembered today my hands are up too I want you to pray for me Lord Jesus as a faulty preacher I come before you today I bring my faulty congregation as a preacher who's fallen short of the glory of God many times oh I don't drink run around commit adultery on my wife none of that stuff Lord and many times we know it's not so much what we do but rather it's sins of omission things that we know we should do that we don't do we don't pray like we should we don't read the word like we should we don't reach out to others like we should we don't minister to one another like we should those are sins of omission we pray you'd forgive us father we know we should forgive and not hold any Grudge in our heart and I have it here laying before me where your Prophet said that if we hold things in our heart against people even though they have done us terribly wrong you will not hear us when we pray dear God I need you to desperately Lord your people father they need me in the wee hours of the morning when they're sick or their babies are sick I don't need nothing in my heart that would hinder my prayers but help these people to realize not only does their Pastor not need that they don't need it either so maybe there's some here today that's holding things in their heart and it seems like you're not answering their prayers that could be the answer because they're holding something in their heart someone did them terribly wrong awful absolutely awful treated them bad and maybe they done it over and over again but yet that son or daughter has held that in their heart and it's grow into a root of bitterness and it seemed like when they pray nothing happens and then they've got to the place they don't even hardly pray anymore Lord Jesus you're speaking to someone right right now dear God may you deal with each of our hearts today Father there's anything anything in our hearts and our lives oh Jesus please help us we need you so much father help me Lord help me in my Ministry father oh Jesus I I I don't know what I'll have when it's safe and done cuz you can give years of your life to people and then they'll turn and walk away from you never even pay you the common courtesy to even come and talk to you before they leave treat you like a dog little do they realize as they treat God's men that's the way they're treating you I've had preachers to do me the same way Lord use you for what they can get out of you and then turn and walk away hide their intent and hide their motive but you take care of that Lord Lord Jesus I want nothing in my heart against no one I don't want anything Lord God that would hinder me nearly every service father we'll have people that'll need prayer I don't want anything but Lord I want it to be when your sick children come up here we can lay our hands on them and watch that evil thing leave them we've seen it happen over and over again and we wanted to continue to do so Lord Jesus help each of us as we search our hearts here today Father we love you Lord May the housewife be encouraged today May the mother the Father the electrician the IT guy whatever they do and whatever you've given them the ability to do Lord we love you today we worship you thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord you've ministered to us now we would like to turn back and minister to you I can't understand how the great Eternal will ever need anything from me but you so orchestrated it this way as one of the brothers this morning and on a Minister's chat had shared it that you would called us to work in your great Kingdom and your Prophet said that we were buddies to God well it's a term that we use here in Tennessee hey buddy how you doing hey buddy hey buddy we text it we email it back and forth to one another it's a pretty awesome thing when I received texts from Brothers great man and said hey buddy how are you hey buddy been thinking about you as I did this morning from several different Brothers hey buddy hey buddy hey buddy but Lord God for you to call me your buddy as flawed as I am and yet you'd still want me to be your buddy thank you Lord Jesus we worship you today Father Can we just raise our hands in the presence of the king is there anybody here today that the Lord ministered to you by song by Prayer by the word yes praise the Lord wonderful thank you Lord all right now let us turn around and Minister back to our husband this week our husband has been blasphemed you probably saw or heard about the opening night at the Olympics and how that they brought a blasphemy against the Last Supper the horrible terrible things that they did his name has been laughed at ridiculed his program has been ridicule this week so whenever I have to meet with people and talk with them or maybe I'm going through a lot of stuff and then I've got a bunch of people that's needing phone calls from around the world and I have to talk to this brother this brother and this brother and this one and this one Carol will come to me and put her arms around me I love you I'm praying for you oh what a value that is so Lord Jesus we want to put our arms around you this morning and we're not going to tell you of course that we're praying for you you don't need our prayers it's our love you need our attention I love you Jesus you're my everything you're the reason I live oh Hallelujah I worship you thank you for giving me your life as Paul said you call me into the ministry just a little bitty Old redneck boy from down in Kentucky but you call me Lord God to be a part of the greatest message that's ever hit the earth I thank you for it Lord Jesus you've given me the opportunity to speak to your people around the world who would have ever s a little bitty old hillbilly boy would be called of God to go around and around the world I thank you for that honor Lord Jesus may I always be faithful but now Jesus I want to minister to you and say how much I love you I don't love you for your gifts I don't love you for your anointing I don't love you for your blessings I love you for who you are hallelujah hallelujah we worship you Lord Jesus can you just tell him in your way I love you Jesus you can't imagine what that means to him just to hear you say it from your mouths I love you Jesus I love you my Lord with all of my heart you are my everything you're the reason I sing I love you I love you my lord we love life we love the Earth we love many many things around us but there's nothing we love like you oh Jesus we adore you praise your Holy Name father thank you Lord Jesus I know school is going to start for some this week maybe some next week or whenever but I'd like for all of our youths that will be starting school again whether it's public school or home school or maybe it's College whatever that it would be maybe we got some here that are teachers even you if you would like to come as well I'd like for you to just come up and kind of stand around the altar here here myself and the minister Brothers of course and also the church we want to just pray for you come on all of you that God will just help you and give you strength I can't imagine what you all deal with and all the things that you have to face every day not just the students but the teachers as well you home school moms You' like to come you're certainly welcome to come with them praise the Lord praise the Lord Jesus oh my goodness dear Lord my goodness dear Lord Jesus anyone else will wait on you thank you Father thank you Father and then you wonder how this could not be a Ministry look at what it is look at the lives that can impact and affect now I want you to pray with me maybe some of you have already completed this task with your children maybe now it's your grandchildren but let's pray together that God will help them and strengthen them some of the teachers here in our church have talked to me before and actually have come up for prayer was some of the things that they deal with and see out of small children it is unbelievable it is unbelievable some of the things that some of the school teachers have told me that they see in school it absolutely breaks my heart what kids are dealing with in this day can't you see Satan is after our youth but we say to the devil the way that Moses said to Egypt we will not leave one hoof behind Lord Jesus I knew there was a bunch of them but I have to say I didn't realize there were so many Lord some of them little tenderhearted children Lord some of them homeschooling some of them going to public school some of them maybe starting College some of them I know Lord are actually teachers themselves Lord we pray for each of them they're standing here with needs lord it's so limited today some of these teachers I know cuz they've told me what they can say they're not allowed to say certain things how difficult that must be they know what these kids need and yet they're not allowed by our educational system to tell them dear God help us father for these here that are teachers May the love of Jesus so come out of their hearts oh Lord God may they be able to experience it they may not be able to discuss Theology and doctrines with them but may they feel the love from the hearts of these teachers Lord that they can know that there's a better world Lord I pray for all of our children whether they're going into kindergarten or first second whatever they're going through Lord maybe some starting College helped them Lord some of them they've been their education has been in homeschool and now they're going out for the first time into maybe a Christian school or a public school to finish up their education or taking a a course in college they haven't been there before it'll be a new world they'll be exposed to things that they've never had before help them Jesus Lord God may you strengthen them I pray for our sisters especially they're going to be questioned about the way they look and the way they dress May the presence of God be with them help them Jesus May the young men here at the church father may they not participate in that which is wrong and evil but may the presence of God give them that Grace I know what it was like when I was a young man going to school and laughed at and ridiculed and I can't imagine how much harder that it is today but your power is just the same would you keep them Jesus give him Grace I pray father you come to this earth and you could have come a full grown man after all that's the way you f made your first man on the earth Adam was not a baby but he was created a full grown man but the prophet said you became a baby and you grew up as a teenager so you'd know how it feels to be a teenager we have several of them standing here this morning lord they're teenagers they feel that teenage pull and they go through that rebellion and questioning this and questioning that you allowed yourself those teenage years so you could help our children help them Father we don't want to give up on them Lord move for them Jesus keep them by your grace I pray Lord we commit the students and the teachers parents all to you father in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it and the Saints and the
